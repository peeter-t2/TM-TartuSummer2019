17.26	One thing the world needs,
19.26	one thing this country desperately needs
21.26	is a better way
23.26	of conducting our political debates.
25.26	We need to rediscover
27.26	the lost art of democratic argument.
30.26	(Applause)
36.26	If you think about the arguments we have,
39.26	most of the time it's shouting matches
41.26	on cable television,
43.26	ideological food fights on the floor of Congress.
48.26	I have a suggestion.
50.26	Look at all the arguments we have these days
53.26	over health care,
55.26	over bonuses and bailouts on Wall Street,
58.26	over the gap between rich and poor,
61.26	over affirmative action and same-sex marriage.
64.26	Lying just beneath the surface
66.26	of those arguments,
69.26	with passions raging on all sides,
72.26	are big questions
75.26	of moral philosophy,
77.26	big questions of justice.
79.26	But we too rarely
81.26	articulate and defend
84.26	and argue about
86.26	those big moral questions in our politics.
89.26	So what I would like to do today
92.26	is have something of a discussion.
94.26	First, let me take
96.26	a famous philosopher
98.26	who wrote about those questions
100.26	of justice and morality,
102.26	give you a very short lecture
104.26	on Aristotle of ancient Athens,
107.26	Aristotle's theory of justice,
109.26	and then have a discussion here
112.26	to see whether Aristotle's ideas
114.26	actually inform
116.26	the way we think and argue
118.26	about questions today.
121.26	So, are you ready for the lecture?
125.26	According to Aristotle,
127.26	justice means giving people what they deserve.
133.26	That's it; that's the lecture.
135.26	(Laughter)
138.26	Now, you may say, well, that's obvious enough.
140.26	The real questions begin
142.26	when it comes to arguing about
144.26	who deserves what and why.
148.26	Take the example of flutes.
150.26	Suppose we're distributing flutes.
153.26	Who should get the best ones?
155.26	Let's see what people --
157.26	What would you say?
159.26	Who should get the best flute?
161.26	You can just call it out.
163.26	(Audience: Random.)
165.26	Michael Sandel: At random. You would do it by lottery.
167.26	Or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them.
171.26	Who else?
173.26	(Audience: The best flute players.)
175.26	MS: The best flute players. (Audience: The worst flute players.)
177.26	MS: The worst flute players.
180.26	How many say the best flute players?
184.26	Why?
187.26	Actually, that was Aristotle's answer too.
190.26	(Laughter)
192.26	But here's a harder question.
194.26	Why do you think,
196.26	those of you who voted this way,
198.26	that the best flutes should go to the best flute players?
201.26	Peter: The greatest benefit to all.
203.26	MS: The greatest benefit to all.
205.26	We'll hear better music
207.26	if the best flutes should go to the best flute players.
210.26	That's Peter? (Audience: Peter.)
212.26	MS: All right.
215.26	Well, it's a good reason.
217.26	We'll all be better off if good music is played
219.26	rather than terrible music.
223.26	But Peter,
225.26	Aristotle doesn't agree with you that that's the reason.
228.26	That's all right.
230.26	Aristotle had a different reason
232.26	for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players.
235.26	He said,
237.26	that's what flutes are for --
239.26	to be played well.
242.26	He says that to reason about
244.26	just distribution of a thing,
247.26	we have to reason about,
250.26	and sometimes argue about,
252.26	the purpose of the thing,
254.26	or the social activity --
256.26	in this case, musical performance.
258.26	And the point, the essential nature,
260.26	of musical performance
262.26	is to produce excellent music.
264.26	It'll be a happy byproduct
266.26	that we'll all benefit.
270.26	But when we think about justice,
273.26	Aristotle says,
275.26	what we really need to think about
277.26	is the essential nature of the activity in question
281.26	and the qualities that are worth
284.26	honoring and admiring and recognizing.
287.26	One of the reasons
289.26	that the best flute players should get the best flutes
291.26	is that musical performance
293.26	is not only to make the rest of us happy,
295.26	but to honor
297.26	and recognize
299.26	the excellence
301.26	of the best musicians.
303.26	Now, flutes may seem ... the distribution of flutes
306.26	may seem a trivial case.
309.26	Let's take a contemporary example
311.26	of the dispute about justice.
314.26	It had to do with golf.
316.26	Casey Martin -- a few years ago,
318.26	Casey Martin --
320.26	did any of you hear about him?
322.26	He was a very good golfer,
324.26	but he had a disability.
326.26	He had a bad leg, a circulatory problem,
329.26	that made it very painful
331.26	for him to walk the course.
334.26	In fact, it carried risk of injury.
338.26	He asked the PGA,
340.26	the Professional Golfers' Association,
342.26	for permission to use a golf cart
345.26	in the PGA tournaments.
347.26	"They said, ""No."
349.26	"Now that would give you an unfair advantage."""
351.26	He sued,
353.26	and his case went all the way
355.26	to the Supreme Court, believe it or not,
357.26	the case over the golf cart,
360.26	because the law says
362.26	that the disabled
364.26	must be accommodated,
367.26	provided the accommodation does not
370.26	change the essential nature
373.26	of the activity.
375.26	"He says, ""I'm a great golfer."
377.26	I want to compete.
379.26	But I need a golf cart
381.26	"to get from one hole to the next."""
383.26	Suppose you were
385.26	on the Supreme Court.
387.26	Suppose you were deciding
389.26	the justice of this case.
392.26	How many here would say
394.26	that Casey Martin does have a right to use a golf cart?
397.26	And how many say, no, he doesn't?
401.26	All right, let's take a poll, show of hands.
403.26	How many would rule in favor of Casey Martin?
407.26	And how many would not? How many would say he doesn't?
410.26	All right, we have a good division of opinion here.
414.26	Someone who would not
416.26	grant Casey Martin the right to a golf cart,
418.26	what would be your reason?
420.26	Raise your hand, and we'll try to get you a microphone.
422.26	What would be your reason?
425.26	(Audience: It'd be an unfair advantage.)
427.26	MS: It would be an unfair advantage
430.26	if he gets to ride in a golf cart.
432.26	All right, those of you,
434.26	I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart
437.26	worry about an unfair advantage.
439.26	What about those of you who say
441.26	he should be given a golf cart?
443.26	How would you answer the objection?
445.26	Yes, all right.
447.26	Audience: The cart's not part of the game.
450.26	MS: What's your name? (Audience: Charlie.)
453.26	MS: Charlie says --
456.26	We'll get Charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply.
458.26	Tell us, Charlie,
460.26	why would you say he should be able to use a golf cart?
463.26	Charlie: The cart's not part of the game.
467.26	MS: But what about walking from hole to hole?
470.26	Charlie: It doesn't matter; it's not part of the game.
473.26	MS: Walking the course is not part of the game of golf?
477.26	Charlie: Not in my book, it isn't.
479.26	MS: All right. Stay there, Charlie.
481.26	(Laughter)
483.26	Who has an answer for Charlie?
486.26	All right, who has an answer for Charlie?
488.26	What would you say?
490.26	Audience: The endurance element is a very important part of the game,
493.26	walking all those holes.
495.26	MS: Walking all those holes?
497.26	That's part of the game of golf? (Audience: Absolutely.)
500.26	MS: What's your name? (Audience: Warren.)
502.26	MS: Warren.
505.26	Charlie, what do you say to Warren?
509.26	Charley: I'll stick to my original thesis.
511.26	(Laughter)
517.26	MS: Warren, are you a golfer?
519.26	Warren: I am not a golfer.
521.26	Charley: And I am. (MS: Okay.)
523.26	(Laughter)
525.26	(Applause)
529.26	You know,
531.26	it's interesting.
535.26	In the case, in the lower court,
537.26	they brought in golfing greats
540.26	to testify on this very issue.
544.26	Is walking the course essential to the game?
547.26	And they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer.
550.26	And what do you suppose they all said?
552.26	Yes. They agreed with Warren.
555.26	They said, yes, walking the course
557.26	is strenuous physical exercise.
559.26	The fatigue factor is an important part of golf.
562.26	And so it would change
564.26	the fundamental nature of the game
567.26	to give him the golf cart.
569.26	Now, notice,
571.26	something interesting --
573.26	Well, I should tell you about the Supreme Court first.
575.26	The Supreme Court
577.26	decided.
579.26	What do you suppose they said?
582.26	They said yes,
584.26	that Casey Martin must be provided a golf cart.
587.26	Seven to two, they ruled.
590.26	What was interesting about their ruling
594.26	and about the discussion we've just had
598.26	is that the discussion about
600.26	the right, the justice, of the matter
602.26	depended on
604.26	figuring out what is
607.26	the essential nature of golf.
610.26	And the Supreme Court justices
612.26	wrestled with that question.
614.26	And Justice Stevens, writing for the majority,
616.26	said he had read all about the history of golf,
621.26	and the essential point of the game
624.26	is to get very small ball from one place
626.26	into a hole
628.26	in as few strokes as possible,
631.26	and that walking was not essential, but incidental.
633.26	Now, there were two dissenters,
635.26	one of whom was Justice Scalia.
640.26	He wouldn't have granted the cart,
643.26	and he had a very interesting dissent.
645.26	It's interesting because
647.26	he rejected the Aristotelian premise
650.26	underlying the majority's opinion.
652.26	He said it's not possible
655.26	to determine the essential nature
658.26	of a game like golf.
660.26	Here's how he put it.
662.26	"""To say that something is essential"
664.26	is ordinarily to say that it is necessary
666.26	to the achievement of a certain object.
669.26	But since it is the very nature of a game
671.26	to have no object except amusement,
675.26	(Laughter)
679.26	that is, what distinguishes games
681.26	from productive activity,
683.26	(Laughter)
686.26	it is quite impossible to say
688.26	that any of a game's arbitrary rules
691.26	"is essential."""
693.26	So there you have Justice Scalia
695.26	taking on the Aristotelian premise
698.26	of the majority's opinion.
701.26	Justice Scalia's opinion
704.26	is questionable
706.26	for two reasons.
708.26	First, no real sports fan would talk that way.
711.26	(Laughter)
713.26	If we had thought that the rules
715.26	of the sports we care about
717.26	are merely arbitrary,
719.26	rather than designed to call forth
722.26	the virtues and the excellences
725.26	that we think are worthy of admiring,
727.26	we wouldn't care about the outcome of the game.
730.26	It's also objectionable
733.26	on a second ground.
735.26	On the face of it,
737.26	it seemed to be -- this debate about the golf cart --
740.26	an argument about fairness,
743.26	what's an unfair advantage.
747.26	But if fairness were the only thing at stake,
750.26	there would have been an easy and obvious solution.
753.26	What would it be? (Audience: Let everyone use the cart.)
755.26	Let everyone ride in a golf cart
758.26	if they want to.
760.26	Then the fairness objection goes away.
763.26	But letting everyone ride in a cart
766.26	would have been, I suspect,
768.26	more anathema
770.26	to the golfing greats
772.26	and to the PGA,
774.26	even than making an exception for Casey Martin.
776.26	Why?
778.26	Because what was at stake
780.26	in the dispute over the golf cart
783.26	was not only the essential nature of golf,
786.26	but, relatedly, the question:
789.26	What abilities
792.26	are worthy
794.26	of honor and recognition
796.26	as athletic talents?
799.26	Let me put the point
801.26	as delicately as possible:
804.26	Golfers are a little sensitive
806.26	about the athletic status of their game.
809.26	(Laughter)
815.26	After all, there's no running or jumping,
818.26	and the ball stands still.
821.26	(Laughter)
824.26	So if golfing is the kind of game
827.26	that can be played while riding around in a golf cart,
830.26	it would be hard to confer
833.26	on the golfing greats
835.26	the status that we confer,
837.26	the honor and recognition
839.26	that goes to truly great athletes.
843.26	That illustrates
846.26	that with golf,
849.26	as with flutes,
851.26	it's hard to decide the question
854.26	of what justice requires,
857.26	without grappling with the question,
859.26	"""What is the essential nature"
861.26	of the activity in question,
863.26	and what qualities,
866.26	what excellences
868.26	connected with that activity,
870.26	"are worthy of honor and recognition?"""
874.26	Let's take a final example
876.26	that's prominent in contemporary political debate:
879.26	same-sex marriage.
883.26	There are those who favor state recognition
886.26	only of traditional marriage
888.26	between one man and one woman,
891.26	and there are those who favor state recognition
893.26	of same-sex marriage.
895.26	How many here
897.26	favor the first policy:
899.26	the state should recognize traditional marriage only?
904.26	And how many favor the second, same-sex marriage?
908.26	Now, put it this way:
911.26	What ways of thinking
913.26	about justice and morality
915.26	underlie the arguments we have
917.26	over marriage?
919.26	The opponents of same-sex marriage say
922.26	that the purpose of marriage,
924.26	fundamentally, is procreation,
926.26	and that's what's worthy of honoring
928.26	and recognizing and encouraging.
931.26	And the defenders of same-sex marriage say no,
934.26	procreation is not the only purpose of marriage;
938.26	what about a lifelong, mutual, loving commitment?
941.26	That's really what marriage is about.
945.26	So with flutes, with golf carts,
948.26	and even with a fiercely contested question
951.26	like same-sex marriage,
954.26	Aristotle has a point.
957.26	Very hard to argue about justice
959.26	without first arguing
962.26	about the purpose of social institutions
965.26	and about what qualities are worthy
967.26	of honor and recognition.
970.26	So let's step back from these cases
973.26	and see how they shed light
976.26	on the way we might improve, elevate,
979.26	the terms of political discourse
982.26	in the United States,
984.26	and for that matter, around the world.
987.26	There is a tendency to think
989.26	that if we engage too directly
992.26	with moral questions in politics,
994.26	that's a recipe for disagreement,
996.26	and for that matter, a recipe for
998.26	intolerance and coercion.
1000.26	So better to shy away from,
1002.26	to ignore,
1004.26	the moral and the religious convictions
1006.26	that people bring to civic life.
1008.26	It seems to me that our discussion
1011.26	reflects the opposite,
1013.26	that a better way
1016.26	to mutual respect
1018.26	is to engage directly
1020.26	with the moral convictions
1022.26	citizens bring to public life,
1025.26	rather than to require
1027.26	that people leave their deepest moral convictions
1030.26	outside politics
1032.26	before they enter.
1034.26	That, it seems to me, is a way
1036.26	to begin to restore
1038.26	the art of democratic argument.
1040.26	Thank you very much.
1042.26	(Applause)
1045.26	Thank you.
1047.26	(Applause)
1050.26	Thank you.
1052.26	(Applause)
1054.26	Thank you very much.
1056.26	Thanks. Thank you.
1059.26	Chris.
1061.26	Thanks, Chris.
1064.26	Chris Anderson: From flutes to golf courses
1066.26	to same-sex marriage --
1068.26	that was a genius link.
1070.26	Now look, you're a pioneer of open education.
1073.26	Your lecture series was one of the first to do it big.
1075.26	What's your vision for the next phase of this?
1078.26	MS: Well, I think that it is possible.
1081.26	In the classroom, we have arguments
1084.26	on some of the most fiercely held
1087.26	moral convictions that students have
1089.26	about big public questions.
1091.26	And I think we can do that in public life more generally.
1094.26	And so my real dream would be
1096.26	to take the public television series
1098.26	that we've created of the course --
1100.26	it's available now, online,
1102.26	free for everyone anywhere in the world --
1104.26	and to see whether we can partner with institutions,
1107.26	at universities in China, in India,
1109.26	in Africa, around the world,
1111.26	to try to promote
1114.26	civic education
1116.26	and also a richer kind
1118.26	of democratic debate.
1121.26	CA: So you picture, at some point,
1123.26	live, in real time,
1125.26	you could have this kind of conversation, inviting questions,
1128.26	but with people from China and India joining in?
1131.26	MS: Right. We did a little bit of it here
1133.26	with 1,500 people in Long Beach,
1135.26	and we do it in a classroom at Harvard
1138.26	with about 1,000 students.
1140.26	Wouldn't it be interesting
1142.26	to take this way
1145.26	of thinking and arguing,
1147.26	engaging seriously with big moral questions,
1150.26	exploring cultural differences
1152.26	and connect through a live video hookup,
1156.26	students in Beijing and Mumbai
1158.26	and in Cambridge, Massachusetts
1160.26	and create a global classroom.
1162.26	That's what I would love to do.
1164.26	(Applause)
1168.26	CA: So, I would imagine
1170.26	that there are a lot of people who would love to join you in that endeavor.
1173.26	Michael Sandel. Thank you so much. (MS: Thanks so much.)
