25	My name is Lovegrove.
26.24	I only know nine Lovegroves,
26.24	two of which are my parents.
30.36	They are first cousins, and you know
30.36	what happens when, you know --
34.2	(Laughter)
35.44	So there's a terribly weird
35.44	freaky side to me,
39.68	which I'm fighting with all the time.
41.56	So to try and get through today,
44.36	I've kind of disciplined myself
44.36	with an 18-minute talk.
47.44	I was hanging on to have a pee.
48.96	I thought perhaps
48.96	if I was hanging on long enough,
51.32	that would guide me
51.32	through the 18 minutes.
53.344	(Laughter)
55.68	OK. I am known as Captain Organic
62.2	and that's a philosophical position
62.2	as well as an aesthetic position.
67	But today what I'd like to talk
67	to you about is that love of form
70.84	and how form can touch
70.84	people's soul and emotion.
76.68	Not very long ago,
76.68	not many thousands of years ago,
81.64	we actually lived in caves,
83.6	and I don't think
83.6	we've lost that coding system.
87.88	We respond so well to form.
91.04	But I'm interested
91.04	in creating intelligent form.
93.52	I'm not interested at all in blobism
95.48	or any of that superficial rubbish
95.48	that you see coming out as design.
99.52	This artificially induced
99.52	consumerism -- I think it's atrocious.
104.6	My world is the world
104.6	of people like Amory Lovins,
109.24	Janine Benyus, James Watson.
111.72	I'm in that world,
111.72	but I work purely instinctively.
115.36	I'm not a scientist.
115.36	I could have been, perhaps,
118.12	but I work in this world
118.12	where I trust my instincts.
120.96	So I am a 21st-century
120.96	translator of technology
127.64	into products that we use everyday
127.64	and relate beautifully and naturally with.
132.8	And we should be developing things --
132.8	we should be developing packaging
136.56	for ideas which elevate
136.56	people's perceptions
140.44	and respect for the things
140.44	that we dig out of the earth
143.96	and translate into products
143.96	for everyday use.
146.24	So, the water bottle.
148.72	I'll begin with this concept
148.72	of what I call DNA.
151.4	DNA: Design, Nature, Art.
153.6	These are the three things
153.6	that condition my world.
156.005	Here is a drawing by Leonardo da Vinci,
161.52	It shows how observation,
161.52	curiosity and instinct
166.6	work to create amazing art.
169.84	Industrial design is the art form
169.84	of the 21st century.
172.64	People like Leonardo --
172.64	there have not been many --
176.2	had this amazingly instinctive curiosity.
179.84	I work from a similar position.
181.36	I don't want to sound
181.36	pretentious saying that,
183.527	but this is my drawing made
183.527	on a digital pad a couple of years ago --
187.32	well into the 21st century,
189.68	It's my impression of water.
192.68	Impressionism being the most valuable
192.68	art form on the planet as we know it:
198.6	I use, now, a whole new process.
200.48	A few years ago I reinvented my process
202.48	to keep up with people like Greg Lynn,
202.48	Thom Mayne, Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas --
207.04	all these people that I think
207.04	are persevering and pioneering
210.4	with fantastic new ideas
210.4	of how to create form.
214.44	This is all created digitally.
215.96	Here you see the machining,
215.96	the milling of a block of acrylic.
219.24	This is what I show to the client to say,
219.24	"""That's what I want to do."""
222.503	At that point, I don't know
222.503	if that's possible at all.
225.051	It's a seductor, but I just feel
225.051	in my bones that that's possible.
230.96	So we go, we look at the tooling.
233.16	We look at how that is produced.
234.8	These are the invisible things
234.8	that you never see in your life.
237.777	This is the background noise
237.777	of industrial design.
240.36	That is like an Anish Kapoor
240.36	flowing through a Richard Serra.
244.2	It is more valuable
244.2	than the product in my eyes.
246.463	I don't have one.
247.869	When I do make some money,
247.869	I'll have one machined for myself.
250.781	This is the final product.
252.058	When they sent it to me,
252.058	I thought I'd failed.
254.299	It felt like nothing.
254.299	It has to feel like nothing.
256.68	It was when I put the water in
258.24	that I realized that I'd put
258.24	a skin on water itself.
260.92	It's an icon of water itself,
262.96	and it elevates people's perception
262.96	of contemporary design.
266.8	Each bottle is different,
268.16	meaning the water level
268.16	will give you a different shape.
270.804	It's mass individualism
270.804	from a single product.
273.84	It fits the hand.
275.08	It fits arthritic hands.
275.08	It fits children's hands.
277.44	It makes the product strong,
277.44	the tessellation.
279.607	It's a millefiori of ideas.
281.92	In the future, they will look like that,
284.68	because we need to move away
284.68	from those type of polymers
287.331	and use that for medical equipment
288.982	and more important things,
288.982	perhaps, in life.
291.062	Biopolymers, these new
291.062	ideas for materials,
293.76	will come into play in probably a decade.
296.2	It doesn't look as cool, does it?
297.8	But I can live up to that.
297.8	I don't have a problem with that.
300.88	I design for that condition,
300.88	biopolymers. It's the future.
305.76	I took this video in Cape Town last year.
308.2	This is the freaky side coming out.
309.96	I have this special interest
309.96	in things like this, which blow my mind.
314.52	I don't know whether to,
314.52	you know, drop to my knees, cry;
317.48	I don't know what I think.
318.76	But I just know that nature --
322.12	nature improves with ever-greater purpose
327.12	that which once existed,
330.08	and that strangeness
330.08	is a consequence of innovative thinking.
333.24	When I look at these things,
333.24	they look pretty normal to me.
336.52	But these things evolved over many years,
336.52	and what we're trying to do --
339.925	I get three weeks to design a telephone.
339.925	How the hell do I do that,
343.12	when you get these things that take
343.12	hundreds of millions of years to evolve?
346.74	How do you condense that?
348.16	It comes back to instinct.
349.72	I'm not talking about designing
349.72	telephones that look like that
352.68	and I'm not looking
352.68	at designing architecture like that.
355.324	I'm just interested
355.324	in natural growth patterns
357.56	and the beautiful forms
357.56	that only nature really creates.
361.76	How that flows through me
361.76	and how that comes out
364.56	is what I'm trying to understand.
366.2	This is a scan through the human forearm.
369.12	It's then blown up
369.12	through rapid prototyping
372.16	to reveal its cellular structure.
373.76	I have these in my office.
375.28	My office is a mixture
375.28	of the Natural History Museum
378.32	and a NASA space lab.
380	It's a weird, kind of freaky place.
382.84	This is one of my specimens.
384.96	This is made --
386.2	bone is made from a mixture
386.2	of inorganic minerals and polymers.
393	I studied cooking in school
393	for four years, and in that experience,
397.76	"which was called ""domestic science,"""
399.499	it was a bit of a cheap trick for me
399.499	to try and get a science qualification.
403.095	(Laughter)
404.68	Actually, I put marijuana
404.68	in everything I cooked --
407.4	(Laughter)
408.64	And I had access to all
408.64	the best girls. It was fabulous.
411.284	All the guys in the rugby team
411.284	couldn't understand.
413.689	Anyway -- this is a meringue.
415.28	This is another sample I have.
416.76	A meringue is made exactly the same way,
416.76	in my estimation, as a bone.
420.16	It's made from
420.16	polysaccharides and proteins.
423.84	If you pour water on that, it dissolves.
426.04	Could we be manufacturing
426.04	from foodstuffs in the future?
429.72	Not a bad idea. I don't know.
431.52	I need to talk to Janine
431.52	and a few other people about that,
434.306	but I believe instinctively that
434.306	that meringue can become something,
438.12	a car -- I don't know.
440.318	I'm also interested in growth patterns:
442.2	the unbridled way that nature grows things
446.72	so you're not restricted by form at all.
449.32	These interrelated forms,
449.32	they do inspire everything I do,
453	although I might end up
453	making something incredibly simple.
456.48	This is a detail of a chair
456.48	that I've designed in magnesium.
459.72	It shows this interlocution of elements
459.72	and the beauty of, kind of, engineering
464.8	and biological thinking,
466.809	shown pretty much as a bone structure.
468.92	Any one of those elements
468.92	you could sort of hang on the wall
471.76	as some kind of art object.
473.44	It's the world's first chair
473.44	made in magnesium.
476.24	It cost 1.7 million dollars to develop.
478.32	"It's called ""Go,"" by Bernhardt, USA."
481.32	It went into Time magazine in 2001
481.32	as the new language of the 21st century.
487.08	Boy. For somebody growing up in Wales
487.08	in a little village, that's enough.
492.2	It shows how you make one holistic form,
492.2	like the car industry,
495.2	and then you break up what you need.
496.939	This is an absolutely
496.939	beautiful way of working.
499.16	It's a godly way of working.
501.44	It's organic and it's essential.
503.72	It's an absolutely fat-free design,
505.411	and when you look at it,
505.411	you see human beings.
509.32	When that moves into polymers,
510.773	you can change the elasticity,
510.773	the fluidity of the form.
515.16	This is an idea for a gas-injected,
515.16	one-piece polymer chair.
518.8	What nature does
518.8	is it drills holes in things.
521.6	It liberates form.
522.84	It takes away anything extraneous.
524.96	That's what I do.
526.2	I make organic things which are essential.
528.64	And they look funky, too --
528.64	but I don't set out to make funky things
532.76	because I think
532.76	that's an absolute disgrace.
534.84	I set out to look at natural forms.
536.96	If you took the idea of fractal technology
536.96	further, take a membrane,
540.96	shrinking it down constantly
540.96	like nature does --
543.679	that could be a seat for a chair.
545.28	It could be a sole for a sports shoe.
547.08	It could be a car blending into seats.
549.96	Wow. Let's go for it.
549.96	That's the kind of stuff.
552.64	This is what exists in nature.
554.48	Observation now allows us
554.48	to bring that natural process
559.44	into the design process every day.
561.48	That's what I do.
562.72	This is a show
562.72	that's currently on in Tokyo.
564.8	"It's called ""Superliquidity."""
564.8	It's my sculptural investigation.
568.48	It's like 21st-century Henry Moore.
571.16	When you see a Henry Moore, still,
571.16	your hair stands up.
575	There's some amazing spiritual connect.
577.24	If he was a car designer,
577.24	phew, we'd all be driving one.
581.16	In his day, he was
581.16	the highest taxpayer in Britain.
584.36	That is the power of organic design.
586.76	It contributes immensely to our --
591.72	sense of being,
593.28	our sense of relationships with things,
595.162	our sensuality and,
595.162	you know, the sort of --
597.36	even the sort of socio-erotic side,
597.36	which is very important.
601.4	This is my artwork.
601.4	This is all my process.
603.92	These actually are sold as artwork.
603.92	They're very big prints.
607.96	But this is how I get to that object.
610.48	Ironically, that object was made
610.48	by the Killarney process,
613.68	which is a brand-new process here
613.68	for the 21st century,
616.32	and I can hear Greg Lynn
616.32	laughing his socks off as I say that.
619.36	I'll tell you about that later.
621.08	When I look into these data images,
624.88	I see new things.
626.64	It's self-inspired.
629.24	Diatomic structures, radiolaria,
631.12	the things that we couldn't see
631.12	but we can do now --
633.573	these, again, are cored out.
634.933	They're made virtually from nothing.
634.933	They're made from silica.
638.36	Why not structures from cars like that?
640.56	Coral, all these natural forces,
643.68	take away what they don't need
643.68	and they deliver maximum beauty.
648.88	We need to be in that realm.
651.16	I want to do stuff like that.
653.56	This is a new chair which should
653.56	come on the market in September.
656.632	It's for a company called Moroso in Italy.
656.632	It's a gas-injected polymer chair.
660.48	Those holes you see there
660.48	are very filtered-down,
663.16	watered-down versions of the extremity
663.16	of the diatomic structures.
667.2	It goes with the flow
667.2	of the polymer and you'll see --
669.748	there's an image coming up
669.748	right now that shows the full thing.
672.76	It's great to have companies in Italy
672.76	who support this way of dreaming.
676.68	If you see the shadows
676.68	that come through that,
678.855	they're actually probably
678.855	more important than the product,
681.601	but it's the minimum it takes.
683.062	The coring out of the back
683.062	lets you breathe.
685.36	It takes away any material you don't need
687.337	and it actually garners flexure too.
691.32	I was going to break into a dance then.
694.44	This is some current work I'm doing.
696.4	I'm looking at single-surface structures
698.48	and how they stretch and flow.
701.2	It's based on furniture typologies,
701.2	but that's not the end motivation.
707.04	It's made from aluminum ...
709.8	as opposed to aluminium, and it's grown.
713.08	It's grown in my mind,
714.32	and then it's grown in terms
714.32	of the whole process that I go through.
718.92	This is two weeks ago in CCP in Coventry,
718.92	who build parts for Bentleys and so on.
723.6	It's being built as we speak
725.8	and it will be on show in Phillips
725.8	next year in New York.
728.8	I have a big show
728.8	with Phillips Auctioneers.
731.68	When I see these animations,
731.68	oh Jesus, I'm blown away.
734.68	This is what goes on
734.68	in my studio everyday.
736.72	I walk -- I'm traveling. I come back.
738.52	Some guy's got that on a computer --
738.52	there's this like, oh my goodness.
741.878	So I try to create this energy
741.878	of invention every day in my studio.
745.64	This kind of effervescent --
747.68	fully charged sense of soup
747.68	that delivers ideas.
753.28	Single-surface products.
755.28	Furniture's a good one.
757	How you grow legs out of a surface.
759.84	I would love to build this one day
761.484	and perhaps I'd like
761.484	to build it also out of flour, sugar,
764.48	polymer, wood chips --
764.48	I don't know, human hair.
768.12	I don't know. I'd love a go at that.
768.12	I don't know. If I just got some time.
771.84	That's the weird side coming out again.
771.84	A lot of companies don't understand that.
775.68	Three weeks ago I was with Sony in Tokyo.
778.4	"They said, ""Give us the dream."
778.4	"What is our dream? How do we beat Apple?"""
781.821	"I said, ""You don't copy Apple,"
781.821	that's for sure.
784.044	"You get into biopolymers."""
785.328	They looked straight through me.
787.92	What a waste. Anyway.
789.76	(Laughter)
791	No, it's true. Fuck them.
791	You know, I mean --
794.24	(Laughter)
795.6	I'm delivering; they're not taking.
797.84	I've had this image 20 years.
799.4	I've had this image of a water droplet
799.4	for 20 years, sitting on a hot bed.
803.04	That is an image of a car for me.
804.84	That's the car of the future.
804.84	It's a water droplet.
807.245	I've been banging on about this
807.245	like I can't believe.
809.84	Cars are all wrong.
811.08	I'm going to show you
811.08	something a bit weird now.
813.343	They laughed everywhere
813.343	over the world I showed this.
815.96	The only place
815.96	that didn't laugh was Moscow.
818.04	Cars are made from 30,000 components.
819.88	How ridiculous is that?
819.88	Couldn't you make that from 300?
825.56	It's got a vacuum-formed,
825.56	carbon-nylon pan.
828.72	Everything's holistically integrated.
828.72	It opens and closes like a bread bin.
832.276	There is no engine.
832.276	There's a solar panel on the back
834.783	and there are batteries in the wheels;
834.783	they're fitted like Formula 1.
838.107	You take them off your wall,
838.107	you plug them in. Off you go.
840.941	A three-wheeled car: slow, feminine,
843.68	transparent, so you can see
843.68	the people in there.
845.943	You drive different.
847.444	You see that thing. You do. You do.
849.64	And not anesthetized, separated from life.
852.36	There's a hole at the front
852.36	and there's a reason for that.
855.68	It's a city car.
855.68	You drive along. You get out.
859.12	You drive on to a proboscis. You get out.
862.96	It lifts you up.
864.2	It presents the solar panel to the sun,
864.2	and at night, it's a street lamp.
867.74	(Applause)
871.92	That's what happens if you get inspired
871.92	by the street lamp first,
874.992	and do the car second.
876.2	I can see these bubbles
876.2	with these hydrogen packages,
878.84	floating around
878.84	on the ground, driven by AI.
883.64	When I showed this in South Africa,
885.339	everybody afterwards was going,
885.339	"""Hey, car on a stick. Like this."""
888.466	Can you imagine? A car on a stick.
890.15	(Laughter)
891.36	If you put it next to
891.36	contemporary architecture,
894	it feels totally natural to me.
895.56	And that's what I do with my furniture.
897.442	I'm not putting Charles Eames'
897.442	furniture in buildings anymore.
900.6	I'm trying to build furniture
900.6	which fits architecture.
903.217	I'm trying to build
903.217	transportation systems.
905.248	I work on aircraft for Airbus,
907.566	I do all this sort of stuff
908.88	trying to force these natural,
908.88	inspired-by-nature dreams home.
912.68	I'm going to finish on two things.
914.48	This is the stereolithography
914.48	of a staircase.
917	It's a little bit of a dedication
917	to James, James Watson.
921.92	I built this thing for my studio.
923.52	It cost me 250,000 dollars to build this.
926.76	Most people go and buy the Aston Martin.
929.68	I built this.
930.92	This is the data that goes with that.
930.92	Incredibly complex.
933.72	Took about two years,
933.72	because I'm looking for fat-free design.
937.56	Lean, efficient things. Healthy products.
942.12	This is built by composites.
943.56	It's a single element which rotates around
943.56	to create a holistic element,
948.2	and this is a carbon-fiber handrail
948.2	which is only supported in two places.
952.04	Modern materials
952.04	allow us to do modern things.
954.96	This is a shot in the studio.
956.6	This is how it looks
956.6	pretty much every day.
959.16	You wouldn't want to have
959.16	a fear of heights coming down it.
961.96	There is virtually no handrail.
961.96	It doesn't pass any standards.
966.36	(Laughter)
968.44	Who cares?
969.68	(Laughter)
971.12	And it has an internal handrail
971.12	which gives it its strength.
974.002	It's this holistic integration.
974.002	That's my studio. It's subterranean.
977.217	It's in Notting Hill,
977.217	next to all the crap --
979.56	the prostitutes and all that stuff.
981.28	It's next to David Hockney's
981.28	original studio.
983.44	It has a lighting system
983.44	that changes throughout the day.
986.139	My guys go out for lunch.
986.139	The door's open. They come back in,
989.028	because it's normally raining
989.028	and they prefer to stay in.
991.987	This is my studio.
993.196	Elephant skull
993.196	from Oxford University, 1988.
995.44	I bought that last year.
995.44	They're very difficult to find.
998.084	If anybody's got a whale skeleton
998.084	they want to sell me,
1000.68	I'll put it in the studio.
1002.24	So I'm just going
1002.24	to interject a little bit
1004.6	with some of the things
1004.6	that you'll see in the video.
1007.36	It's a homemade video, made it myself
1007.36	at three o'clock in the morning
1010.68	just to show you how my real world is.
1013.12	You never see that.
1014.36	You never see architects or designers
1014.36	showing you their real world.
1017.527	"This is called a ""Plasnet."""
1018.84	It's a new bio-polycarbonate chair
1018.84	I'm doing in Italy.
1022.72	World's first bamboo bike
1022.72	with folding handlebars.
1025.72	We should all be riding one of these.
1027.52	As China buys all these crappy cars,
1027.52	we should be riding things like this.
1031.64	Counterbalance.
1034.36	Like I say, it's a cross
1035.6	between Natural History Museum
1035.6	and a NASA laboratory.
1038.84	It's full of prototypes and objects.
1041.04	It's self-inspirational, again.
1042.734	I mean, the rare times when I'm there,
1044.633	I do enjoy it.
1046.24	And I get lots and lots of kids coming.
1050.119	I'm a contaminator for all those children
1050.119	of investment bankers -- wankers.
1055.359	Sorry.
1056.599	(Laughter)
1058.56	That's a solar seed.
1058.56	It's a concept for new architecture.
1061.4	That thing on the top is the world's
1061.4	first solar-powered garden lamp --
1065.16	the first produced.
1066.92	Giles Revell should be
1066.92	talking here today --
1069.119	amazing photography
1069.119	of things you can't see.
1071.359	The first sculptural model
1071.359	I made for that thing in Tokyo.
1077.68	Lots of stuff.
1077.68	There's a little leaf chair --
1079.8	that golden looking thing
1079.8	"is called ""Leaf."""
1081.824	It's made from Kevlar.
1083.4	On the wall is my book
1083.4	"called ""Supernatural,"""
1085.56	which allows me to remember
1085.56	what I've done, because I forget.
1088.442	There's an aerated brick
1088.442	I did in Limoges last year,
1091.04	in Concepts for New Ceramics
1091.04	in Architecture.
1097.16	Gernot Oberfell, working
1097.16	at three o'clock in the morning --
1100	and I don't pay overtime.
1102.08	Overtime is the passion of design,
1105	so join the club or don't.
1107.8	(Laughter)
1109.36	No, it's true. People like Tom and Greg --
1111.384	we're traveling like you can't --
1111.384	we fit it all in.
1113.789	I don't know how we do it.
1115.6	Next week I'm at Electrolux in Sweden,
1115.6	then I'm in Beijing on Friday.
1119.88	You work that one out.
1121.44	And when I see Ed's photographs,
1121.44	I think, why the hell am I going to China?
1125.64	It's true. It's true.
1126.88	Because there's a soul
1126.88	in this whole thing.
1129.04	We need to have a new instinct
1129.04	for the 21st century.
1132.56	We need to combine all this stuff.
1134.88	If all the people who were
1134.88	talking over this period
1137.6	worked on a car together,
1138.84	it would be a joy, absolute joy.
1143.04	So there's a new X-light system
1143.04	I'm doing in Japan.
1147	There's Tuareg shoes from North Africa.
1147	There's a Kifwebe mask.
1151.72	These are my sculptures.
1154.24	A copper jelly mold.
1155.96	(Laughter)
1157.72	It sounds like some quiz show
1157.72	or something, doesn't it?
1162.44	So, it's going to end.
1165.76	Thank you, James,
1165.76	for your great inspiration.
1174.36	Thank you very much.
1175.64	(Applause)
