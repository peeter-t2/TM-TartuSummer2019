25	Video: Narrator: An event seen from one point of view
28	gives one impression.
33	Seen from another point of view, it gives quite a different impression.
38	But it's only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand
42	what's going on.
45	Sasha Vucinic: It's a great clip, isn't it?
48	And I found that in 29 seconds, it tells more about
53	the power of, and importance of, independent media
56	than I could say in an hour.
59	So I thought that it will be good to start with it.
63	And also start with a little bit of statistics.
66	According to relevant researchers, 83 percent of the population of this planet
72	lives in the societies without independent press.
77	Think about that number: 83 percent of the population on the whole planet
82	does not really know what is going on in their countries.
86	The information they get gets filtered through somebody
90	who either twists that information, or colors that information,
94	does something with it.
95	So they're deprived of understanding their reality.
100	That is just to understand how big and important this problem is.
106	Now those of you who are lucky enough to live in those societies
113	that represent 17 percent, I think should enjoy it until it lasts.
119	You know, Sunday morning, you flick the paper, get your cappuccino.
123	Enjoy it while it lasts.
124	Because as we heard yesterday, countries can lose stars from their flags,
131	but they can also lose press freedom,
134	as I guess Americans among us can tell us more about.
139	But that's totally another and separate topic.
142	So I can go back to my story.
146	My story starts -- the story I want to share -- starts in 1991.
151	At that time I was running B92, the only independent,
155	for that matter the only electronic media, in the country.
158	And I guess we were sharing -- we had that regular life of the only
163	independent media in the country, operating in hostile environment,
169	where government really wants to make your life miserable.
173	And there are different ways.
174	Yeah, it was the usual cocktail:
175	a little bit of threats, a little bit of friendly advice,
178	a little bit of financial police, a little bit of text control,
182	so you always have somebody who never leaves your office.
186	But what they really do, which is very powerful,
191	and that is what governments in the late '90s started doing
195	if they don't like independent media companies --
197	you know, they threaten your advertisers.
199	Once they threaten your advertisers, market forces are actually,
204	you know, destroyed, and the advertisers do not want to come --
209	no matter how much does it make sense for them --
212	do not want to come and advertise.
214	And you have a problem making ends meet.
218	At that time at the beginning of the '90s, we had that problem,
222	which was, you know, survival below one side,
224	but what was really painful for me was,
228	remember, the beginning of the '90s, Yugoslavia is falling apart.
231	We were sitting over there with a country in a downfall,
234	in a slow-motion downfall.
238	And we all had all of that on tapes.
241	We had the ability to understand what was going on.
244	We were actually recording history.
246	The problem was that we had to re-tape that history a week later;
251	because if we did not, we could not afford enough tapes
255	to keep archives of that history.
258	So if I gave you that picture, I don't want to go too long on that.
263	In that context a gentleman came to my office at that time.
267	It was still 1991.
268	He was running a media systems organization
271	which is still in business, the gentleman is still in business.
274	And what did I know at that time about media systems?
277	I would think media systems were organizations,
280	which means they should help you.
284	So I prepared two plans for that meeting, two strategic plans:
287	the small one and the big one.
289	The small one was, I just wanted him
291	to help us get those damn tapes,
293	so we can keep that archive for the next 50 years.
297	The big plan was to ask him for a 1,000,000-dollar loan.
302	Because I thought, I still maintain,
305	that serious and independent media companies are great business.
309	And I thought that B92 will survive and be a great company
313	once Milosevic is gone, which turned out to be true.
316	It's now probably either the biggest or the second biggest
319	media company in the country.
321	And I thought that the only thing that we needed at that time
324	was 1,000,000-dollar loan to take us through those hard times.
328	To make a long story short, the gentleman comes into the office,
332	great suit and tie.
336	I gave him what I thought was a brilliant explanation
340	of the political situation and explained how hard and difficult
345	the war will be.
347	Actually, I underestimated the atrocities, I have to admit.
350	Anyway, after that whole, big, long explanation,
353	the only question he had for me -- and this is not a joke --
358	is, are we paying royalties after we broadcast music
362	of Michael Jackson?
366	That was really the only question he had.
368	He left, and I remember being actually very angry at myself
375	because I thought there must be an institution in the world
379	that is providing loans to media companies.
382	It's so obvious, straight in your face,
385	and somebody must have thought of it.
386	Somebody must have started something like that.
389	And I thought, I'm just dumb and I cannot find it.
393	You know, in my defense, there was no Google at that time;
395	you could not just Google in '91.
398	So I thought that that's actually my problem.
402	Now we go from here, fast forward to 1995.
406	I have -- I left the country, I have a meeting with George Soros,
412	trying for the third time to convince him that
418	his foundation should invest in something that should
421	operate like a media bank.
425	And basically what I was saying is very simple.
428	You know, forget about charity; it doesn't work.
429	Forget about handouts; 20,000 dollars do not help anybody.
434	What you should do is you should treat media companies as a business.
438	It's business anywhere.
440	Media business, or any other business, it needs to be capitalized.
443	And what these guys need, actually, is access to capital.
448	So third meeting, arguments are pretty well exercised.
453	At the end of the meeting he says,
455	look, it is not going to work; you will never see your money back;
459	but my foundations will put 500,000 dollars so you can test the idea.
464	See that it will not work.
469	He said, I'll give you a rope to hang yourself.
471	(Laughter)
473	I knew two things after that meeting.
476	First, under no circumstances I want to hang myself.
480	And second, that I have no idea how to make it work.
486	You see, at the level of a concept, it was a great concept.
490	But it's one thing to have a concept;
492	it's a totally separate thing to actually make it work.
495	So I had absolutely no idea how that could actually work.
499	Had the wrong idea; I thought that we can be a bank.
502	You see banks -- I don't know if there are any bankers over here;
505	I apologize in advance -- but it's the best job in the world.
509	You know, you find somebody who is respectable
512	and has a lot of money.
513	You give them more money; they repay you that over a time.
518	You collect interest and do nothing in between.
520	So I thought, why don't we get into that business?
522	(Laughter)
524	So here we are having our first client, brilliant.
530	First independent newspaper in Slovakia.
532	The government cutting them off
533	from all the printing facilities in Bratislava.
536	So here's the daily newspaper
537	that has to be printed 400 kilometers away from the capital.
541	It's a daily newspaper with a deadline of 4 p.m.
545	That means that they have no sports;
547	they have no latest news; circulation goes down.
550	It's a kind of very nice, sophisticated way
553	how to economically strangle a daily newspaper.
557	They come to us with a request for a loan.
559	They want to -- the only way for them to survive
561	is to get a printing press.
563	And we said, that's fine; let's meet;
566	you'll bring us your business plan, which eventually they did.
570	We start the meeting.
572	I get these two pieces of paper, not like this, A4 format,
576	so it's much bigger.
578	A lot of numbers there. A lot of numbers.
581	But however you put it, you know, the numbers
583	do not make any sense.
585	And that's the best they could do.
587	We were the best that they could do.
588	So that is how we understood what our method is.
590	It's not a bank. We had to actually
593	go into these companies and earn our return
597	by fixing them -- by establishing management systems,
600	by providing all that knowledge, how do you run a business
602	on one side -- while they all know how to run, how to create content.
608	Just quickly on the results.
614	Over these 10 years, 40 million dollars in affordable financing,
620	average interest rate five percent to six percent.
623	Lately we are going wild, charging seven percent from time to time.
629	We do it in 17 countries of the developing world.
633	And here is the most stunning number.
636	Return rate -- the one that Soros was so worried about -- 97 percent.
647	What do we typically finance?
648	We finance anything that a media company would need,
651	from printing presses to transmitters.
656	What is most important is we do it
661	either in form of loans, equities, lease --
664	whatever is appropriate for, you know, supporting anybody.
667	But what is most important here is, who do we finance?
672	We believe that in the last 10 years companies
674	that we've financed are actually the best media companies
678	in the developing world.
680	"That is a ""Who is Who"" list."
682	And I could spend hours talking about them,
687	because they're all kind of heroes.
688	And I can, but I'll give you just, maybe one,
691	and depending on time I may give you two examples
694	who we work with.
695	You see we started working in Eastern and Central Europe,
697	and moved to Russia.
699	Our first loan in Russia was in Chelyabinsk.
702	I'll bet half of you have never heard of that place.
705	In the south of Russia there's a guy called
708	Boris Nikolayevich Kirshin, who is running
710	an independent newspaper there.
712	The city was closed until early '90s
714	because, of all things, they were producing glass for Tupolev planes.
721	Anyway, he's running independent newspaper there.
725	After two years working with us, he becomes
727	the most respected newspaper in that small place.
733	Governor comes to him one day,
735	actually invites him to come to his office.
737	He goes and sees the governor. The governor says,
740	Boris Nikolayevich, I understand you are doing a great job,
742	and you are the most respected newspaper in our district.
748	And I want to offer you a deal.
752	Can you please give me your newspaper for the next nine months,
755	because I have elections --
757	there are elections coming up in nine months.
760	I will not run, but it's very important for me
763	who is going to succeed me.
765	So give me the paper for nine months. I'll give it back to you.
767	I have no interest in being in media business.
770	How much would that cost?
773	"Boris Nikolayevich says, ""It's not for sale."""
775	"The governor says, ""We will close you."""
778	"Boris Nikolayevich says, ""No, you cannot do it."""
780	Six months later the newspaper was closed.
784	Luckily, we had enough time to help Boris Nikolayevich
787	take all the assets out of that company and bring him into a new one,
791	to get all the subscription lists, rehire staff.
795	So what the governor got was an empty shell.
798	But that is what happens if you're in business of independent media,
802	and if you are a banker for independent media.
806	So it sounds like a great story.
812	Somewhere down the road we opened a media management center.
816	We started our media lab, sounds like a real great story.
819	But there is a second angle to that.
822	The second angle, like in this clip.
824	If you take the camera above, you start thinking
826	about these numbers again.
834	That is not too much, is it?
836	It's actually just a drop in the sea.
838	Because when you think about the importance,
840	some of the issues that we were talking about last night --
843	this last session we had about Africa and his
845	hypothetical 50 billion dollars destined for Africa.
850	All of those, not all, half of those problems mentioned last night --
856	government accountability, corruption, how do you fight corruption,
861	giving voice to unheard, to poor --
864	it's why independent media is in business.
868	And it's why it was invented.
870	So from that perspective, what we did is just really
873	one drop in the sea of that need that we can identify.
880	Now ours is just one story.
883	I'm sure that in this room there are, like, 15 other wonderful stories
886	of nonprofits doing spectacular work.
889	Here is where the problem is,
892	and I'll explain to you as well as I can what the problem is.
898	And it's called fundraising.
900	Imagine that this third of this room is filled
904	with people who represent different foundations.
907	Imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations,
912	doing very important work.
915	Now imagine that every second person over here
917	is deaf, does not hear, and switch the lights off.
922	Now that is how difficult it is to match people
924	from this side of the room
926	with people of that side of the room.
929	So we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed
934	to reform, to totally rethink fundraising.
939	You know, instead of people running in this dark,
941	trying to find their own match, who will be willing,
944	who has the same goals.
946	Instead of all of that we thought there is --
949	something new needs to be invented.
952	And we came up with this idea of issuing bonds,
955	press freedom bonds.
956	If there are investors willing to finance
963	U.S. government budget deficit,
965	why wouldn't we find investors willing to finance
968	press freedom deficit?
971	We've decided to do it this fall; we will issue them,
973	probably in denominations of 1,000 dollars.
976	I don't want to advertise them too much; that's not the point.
978	But the point is, if we ever survive to actually issue them,
982	find enough investors that this can be considered a success,
986	there's nothing stopping the next organization
989	to start to issue bonds next spring.
994	And those can be environmental bonds.
996	And then two weeks later, Iqbal Quadir can issue his
1001	electricity in Bangladesh bonds.
1004	And before you know it, any social cause
1007	can be actually financed in this way.
1010	Now we do daydreaming in 11:30 with 55 seconds left.
1015	But let's take the idea further.
1017	You do it, you start it in the States, because it's,
1020	you know, concepts are very, very close to American minds.
1023	But you can actually bring it to Europe, too.
1025	You can bring it to Asia.
1027	You can, once you have all of those different points,
1031	you can make it easy for investors.
1033	Put all of those bonds at one place
1035	and they sit down and click.
1037	Once you have more than 10 of them
1039	you have to develop some kind of a matrix.
1042	What do investors get?
1043	On one side financial, on the other side social.
1046	So that brings the idea of some kind of rating agency,
1052	Morningstar type.
1054	It says, you know, social impact over here is spectacular, five stars.
1058	Financial, they give you one percent, only one star.
1062	Now take it to the last step.
1066	Once you have all of that put together,
1068	there's not one reason why you couldn't actually have
1073	a marketplace for all of that,
1075	where you cannot dispose of all of those bonds in a pretty quick way.
1080	And in that way you organize the financing
1083	so there are no dark rooms, no blind people
1085	running around to find each other.
1087	Thank you.
