12.509	People say things about religion all the time.
16.736	(Laughter)
18.71	The late, great Christopher Hitchens
20.96	"wrote a book called ""God Is Not Great"""
22.381	"whose subtitle was, ""Religion Poisons Everything."""
25.913	(Laughter)
27.286	But last month, in Time magazine,
31.38	Rabbi David Wolpe, who I gather
31.38	is referred to as America's rabbi,
35.393	said, to balance that against
35.393	that negative characterization,
40.031	that no important form of social change
42.655	can be brought about except through organized religion.
46.995	Now, remarks of this sort on the negative
48.973	and the positive side are very old.
52.01	I have one in my pocket here
54.451	from the first century BCE by Lucretius,
60.366	"the author of ""On the Nature of Things,"" who said,"
63.229	"""Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum"" --"
67.512	I should have been able to learn that by heart â€”
70.134	which is, that's how much religion
72.822	is able to persuade people to do evil,
75.332	and he was talking about the fact
77.119	of Agamemnon's decision to place his daughter
80.164	Iphigenia on an altar of sacrifice
82.075	in order to preserve the prospects of his army.
85.575	So there have been these long debates
88.471	over the centuries, in that case, actually,
90.36	we can say over the millennia, about religion.
91.946	People have talked about it a lot,
93.799	and they've said good and bad
95.597	and indifferent things about it.
99.106	What I want to persuade you of today
100.841	is of a very simple claim,
102.444	which is that these debates are
104.681	in a certain sense preposterous,
107.174	because there is no such thing as religion
111.345	about which to make these claims.
113.08	There isn't a thing called religion,
114.468	and so it can't be good or bad.
117.519	It can't even be indifferent.
119.68	And if you think about claims
122.139	about the nonexistence of things,
126.127	one obvious way to try and establish
128.319	the nonexistence of a purported thing
130.771	would be to offer a definition of that thing
133.229	and then to see whether anything satisfied it.
135.99	I'm going to start out on that little route
139.202	to begin with.
140.411	So if you look in the dictionaries
142.988	and if you think about it,
144.138	one very natural definition of religion
146.507	is that it involves belief in gods or in spiritual beings.
152.324	As I say, this is in many dictionaries,
153.83	but you'll also find it actually
156.581	in the work of Sir Edward Tylor,
158.208	who was the first professor
158.208	of anthropology at Oxford,
160.435	one of the first modern anthropologists.
162.431	In his book on primitive culture,
164.665	he says the heart of religion
164.665	is what he called animism,
167.685	that is, the belief in spiritual agency,
169.403	belief in spirits.
171.78	The first problem for that definition
173.788	"is from a recent novel by Paul Beatty called ""Tuff."""
176.528	There's a guy talking to a rabbi.
177.934	The rabbi says he doesn't believe in God.
180.33	"The guy says, ""You're a rabbi,"
180.33	"how can you not believe in God?"""
182.76	"And the reply is, ""It's what's"
182.76	so great about being Jewish.
186.151	You don't have to believe in a God per se,
188.114	"just in being Jewish."" (Laughter)"
190.57	So if this guy is a rabbi, and a Jewish rabbi,
193.598	and if you have to believe in
193.598	God in order to be religious,
196.79	then we have the rather counterintuitive conclusion
200.073	that since it's possible to be a Jewish rabbi
202.265	without believing in God,
204.154	Judaism isn't a religion.
206.504	That seems like a pretty counterintuitive thought.
209.97	Here's another argument against this view.
213.231	A friend of mine, an Indian friend of mine,
215.403	went to his grandfather when he was very young,
217.586	a child, and said to him,
218.721	"""I want to talk to you about religion,"""
220.84	"and his grandfather said, ""You're too young."
222.085	"Come back when you're a teenager."""
223.616	So he came back when he was a teenager,
225.459	and he said to his grandfather,
227.155	"""It may be a bit late now"
228.481	because I've discovered that
228.481	"I don't believe in the gods."""
232.221	And his grandfather, who was a wise man, said,
234.248	"""Oh, so you belong to the atheist branch"
236.432	"of the Hindu tradition."" (Laughter)"
239.618	And finally, there's this guy,
243.32	who famously doesn't believe in God.
245.776	His name is the Dalai Lama.
247.594	He often jokes that he's one
247.594	of the world's leading atheists.
250.242	But it's true, because the Dalai Lama's religion
253.186	does not involve belief in God.
255.966	Now you might think this just shows
257.579	that I've given you the wrong definition
260.599	and that I should come up with some other definition
262.718	and test it against these cases
264.416	and try and find something that captures
266.987	atheistic Judaism, atheistic Hinduism,
269.913	and atheistic Buddhism as forms of religiosity,
273.176	but I actually think that that's a bad idea,
274.97	and the reason I think it's a bad idea
277.299	is that I don't think that's how
278.934	our concept of religion works.
280.565	I think the way our concept of religion works
282.165	is that we actually have, we have a list
285.203	of paradigm religions
287.129	and their sub-parts, right,
290.368	and if something new comes along
292.922	that purports to be a religion,
294.428	"what we ask is, ""Well, is it like one of these?"""
296.892	Right?
299.144	And I think that's not only
299.144	how we think about religion,
301.719	and that's, as it were,
303.019	so from our point of view,
304.81	anything on that list had better be a religion,
306.893	which is why I don't think an account of religion
308.661	that excludes Buddhism and Judaism
310.516	has a chance of being a good starter,
313.216	because they're on our list.
315.92	But why do we have such a list?
317.9	What's going on? How did it come about
319.73	that we have this list?
321.917	I think the answer is a pretty simple one
324.832	and therefore crude and contentious.
327.96	I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with it,
329.349	but here's my story,
330.943	and true or not, it's a story that I think
333.314	gives you a good sense of how
335.742	the list might have come about,
337.431	and therefore helps you to think about
338.74	what use the list might be.
340.184	I think the answer is, European travelers,
343.472	starting roughly about the time of Columbus,
345.305	started going around the world.
346.93	They came from a Christian culture,
349.21	and when they arrived in a new place,
351.02	they noticed that some people
351.02	didn't have Christianity,
353.905	and so they asked themselves
353.905	the following question:
355.95	what have they got instead of Christianity?
359.14	And that list was essentially constructed.
362.503	It consists of the things that other people had
364.779	instead of Christianity.
367.37	Now there's a difficulty with proceeding in that way,
370.738	which is that Christianity is extremely,
373.178	even on that list, it's an extremely specific tradition.
377.59	It has all kinds of things in it
379.151	that are very, very particular
381.277	that are the results of the specifics
383.573	of Christian history,
386.26	and one thing that's at the heart of it,
387.857	one thing that's at the heart of
387.857	most understandings of Christianity,
390.66	which is the result of the
390.66	specific history of Christianity,
392.99	is that it's an extremely creedal religion.
396.133	It's a religion in which people are really concerned
398.813	about whether you believe the right things.
401.552	The history of Christianity, the
401.552	internal history of Christianity,
403.808	is largely the history of people killing each other
405.684	because they believed the wrong thing,
407.8	and it's also involved in
409.879	struggles with other religions,
411.631	obviously starting in the Middle Ages,
415.23	a struggle with Islam,
416.62	in which, again, it was the infidelity,
419.74	the fact that they didn't believe the right things,
421.77	that seemed so offensive to the Christian world.
425.15	Now that's a very specific and particular history
427.788	that Christianity has,
430.153	and not everywhere is everything
433.371	that has ever been put on this sort of list like it.
437.365	Here's another problem, I think.
438.772	A very specific thing happened.
440.11	It was actually adverted to earlier,
441.562	but a very specific thing happened
443.103	in the history of the kind of Christianity
445.292	that we see around us
446.813	mostly in the United States today,
448.997	and it happened in the late 19th century,
452.1	and that specific thing that happened
453.509	in the late 19th century
454.518	was a kind of deal that was cut
457.473	between science,
459.983	this new way of organizing intellectual authority,
465.676	and religion.
466.873	If you think about the 18th century, say,
468.764	if you think about intellectual life
470.234	before the late 19th century,
472.59	anything you did, anything you thought about,
475.76	whether it was the physical world,
478.49	the human world,
480.021	the natural world apart from the human world,
482.251	or morality, anything you did
484.218	would have been framed against the background
485.894	of a set of assumptions that were religious,
488.357	Christian assumptions.
489.56	You couldn't give an account
491.226	of the natural world
492.822	that didn't say something about its relationship,
495.744	for example, to the creation story
497.552	in the Abrahamic tradition,
499.092	the creation story in the first book of the Torah.
502.296	So everything was framed in that way.
505.613	But this changes in the late 19th century,
508.045	and for the first time, it's possible for people
510.37	to develop serious intellectual careers
512.749	as natural historians like Darwin.
514.943	Darwin worried about the relationship between
516.928	what he said and the truths of religion,
519.481	but he could proceed, he could write books
521.406	about his subject
523.19	without having to say what the relationship was
525.886	to the religious claims,
527.358	and similarly, geologists
527.358	increasingly could talk about it.
529.74	In the early 19th century, if you were a geologist
531.542	and made a claim about the age of the Earth,
533.465	you had to explain whether that was consistent
535.107	or how it was or wasn't consistent
536.537	with the age of the Earth implied
537.909	by the account in Genesis.
539.462	By the end of the 19th century,
540.647	you can just write a geology textbook
542.16	in which you make arguments
542.16	about how old the Earth is.
544.519	So there's a big change, and that division,
546.61	that intellectual division of
546.61	labor occurs as I say, I think,
549.545	and it sort of solidifies so that by the end
552.37	of the 19th century in Europe,
555.528	there's a real intellectual division of labor,
557.519	and you can do all sorts of serious things,
559.519	including, increasingly, even philosophy,
563.421	without being constrained by the thought,
566.279	"""Well, what I have to say has to be consistent"
568.56	with the deep truths that are given to me
571.239	"by our religious tradition."""
573.749	So imagine someone who's coming out
575.913	of that world, that late-19th-century world,
579.73	coming into the country that I grew up in, Ghana,
583.482	the society that I grew up in, Asante,
585.742	coming into that world
587.148	at the turn of the 20th century
589.164	with this question that made the list:
591.187	what have they got instead of Christianity?
594.95	Well, here's one thing he would have noticed,
597.807	and by the way, there was a 
597.807	person who actually did this.
600.151	His name was Captain Rattray,
601.45	he was sent as the British
601.45	government anthropologist,
603.502	and he wrote a book about Asante religion.
605.495	This is a soul disc.
608.035	There are many of them in the British Museum.
610.308	I could give you an interesting, different history
611.578	of how it comes about that many of the things
613.743	from my society ended up in the British Museum,
617.134	but we don't have time for that.
618.945	So this object is a soul disc.
620.437	What is a soul disc?
621.575	It was worn around the necks
623.404	of the soul-washers of the Asante king.
625.974	What was their job? To wash the king's soul.
629.529	It would take a long while
631.434	to explain how a soul could be the kind of thing
633.661	that could be washed,
634.961	but Rattray knew that this was religion
637.74	because souls were in play.
641.243	And similarly,
642.989	there were many other things, many other practices.
645.196	For example, every time anybody
645.196	had a drink, more or less,
647.559	they poured a little bit on the ground
649.581	in what's called the libation,
651.31	and they gave some to the ancestors.
652.999	My father did this. Every time
652.999	he opened a bottle of whiskey,
655.348	which I'm glad to say was very often,
656.869	he would take the top off and
656.869	pour off just a little on the ground,
660.748	and he would talk to,
662.099	he would say to Akroma-Ampim, the founder of our line,
665.639	or Yao Antony, my great uncle,
667.235	he would talk to them,
669.13	offer them a little bit of this.
671.353	And finally, there were these
671.353	huge public ceremonials.
674.238	This is an early-19th-century drawing
675.654	by another British military officer
676.927	of such a ceremonial,
678.977	where the king was involved,
681.105	and the king's job,
682.511	one of the large parts of his job,
683.7	apart from organizing warfare and things like that,
686.651	was to look after the tombs of his ancestors,
689.997	and when a king died,
691.994	the stool that he sat on was blackened
693.508	and put in the royal ancestral temple,
696.392	and every 40 days,
698.521	the King of Asante has to go and do cult
700.376	for his ancestors.
701.738	That's a large part of his job,
703.24	and people think that if he doesn't do it,
705.113	things will fall apart.
706.844	So he's a religious figure,
709.21	as Rattray would have said,
710.535	as well as a political figure.
713.16	So all this would count as religion for Rattray,
717.844	but my point is that when you look
719.783	into the lives of those people,
721.165	you also find that every time they do anything,
723.91	they're conscious of the ancestors.
725.944	Every morning at breakfast,
727.977	you can go outside the front of the house
729.803	and make an offering to the god tree, the nyame dua
732.899	outside your house,
734.083	and again, you'll talk to the gods
735.4	and the high gods and the low gods
736.426	and the ancestors and so on.
738.084	This is not a world
739.62	in which the separation between religion and science
742.527	has occurred.
744.101	Religion has not being separated
745.644	from any other areas of life,
746.92	and in particular,
748.917	what's crucial to understand about this world
750.612	is that it's a world in which the job
752.15	that science does for us
753.288	is done by what Rattray is going to call religion,
756.432	because if they want an explanation of something,
758.372	if they want to know why the crop just failed,
760.2	if they want to know why it's raining
761.486	or not raining, if they need rain,
763.904	if they want to know why
766.428	their grandfather has died,
768.287	they are going to appeal to the very same entities,
771.195	the very same language,
772.637	talk to the very same gods about that.
775.253	This great separation, in other words,
777.342	between religion and science hasn't happened.
779.273	Now, this would be a mere historical curiosity,
783.598	except that in large parts of the world,
787.05	this is still the truth.
789.794	I had the privilege of going to a wedding
791.802	the other day in northern Namibia,
796.412	in a village of 200 people.
798.145	These were modern people.
799.313	We had with us Oona Chaplin,
801.204	who some of you may have heard of,
802.613	and one of the people from
802.613	this village came up to her,
804.692	"and said, ""I've seen you in 'Game of Thrones.'"""
807.423	So these were not people who
807.423	were isolated from our world,
811.251	but nevertheless, for them,
812.78	the gods and the spirits are still very much there,
815.333	and when we were on the bus going back and forth
817.159	to the various parts of the [ceremony],
818.821	they prayed not just in a generic way
821.398	but for the safety of the journey,
822.859	and they meant it,
823.77	and when they said to me that my mother,
826.932	the bridegroom's [grandmother],
828.623	was with us, they didn't mean it figuratively.
831.185	They meant, even though she was a dead person,
833.94	they meant that she was still around.
836.518	So in large parts of the world today,
839.067	that separation between science and religion
841.229	hasn't occurred in large parts of the world today,
842.91	and as I say, these are not --
846.638	This guy used to work for Chase and at the World Bank.
851.44	These are fellow citizens of the world with you,
854.147	but they come from a place in which religion
855.956	is occupying a very different role.
857.867	So what I want you to think about
857.867	next time somebody wants
859.993	to make some vast generalization about religion
862.473	is that maybe there isn't such a thing
865.214	as a religion, such a thing as religion,
867.845	and that therefore what they say
869.501	cannot possibly be true.
872.314	(Applause)
