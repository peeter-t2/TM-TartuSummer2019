14.28	Before I get to bulk
14.28	of what I have to say,
17.353	I feel compelled just to mention
17.353	a couple of things about myself.
21.564	I am not some mystical,
24.637	spiritual sort of person.
27.488	I'm a science writer.
29.54	I studied physics in college.
31.835	I used to be a science
31.835	correspondent for NPR.
35.893	OK, that said:
38.372	in the course of working
38.372	on a story for NPR,
41.635	I got some advice from an astronomer
43.937	that challenged my outlook,
46.068	and frankly, changed my life.
49.012	You see, the story was about an eclipse,
51.228	a partial solar eclipse
51.228	that was set to cross the country
55.796	in May of 1994.
58.171	And the astronomer -- I interviewed him,
60.659	and he explained what was going to happen
60.659	and how to view it,
63.96	but he emphasized that, as interesting
63.96	as a partial solar eclipse is,
69.205	a much rarer total solar eclipse
69.205	is completely different.
74.319	In a total eclipse,
74.319	for all of two or three minutes,
77.617	the moon completely blocks
77.617	the face of the sun,
80.972	creating what he described
80.972	as the most awe-inspiring spectacle
86.236	in all of nature.
88.58	And so the advice he gave me was this:
91.907	"""Before you die,"" he said,"
94.928	"""you owe it to yourself"
94.928	"to experience a total solar eclipse."""
99.925	Well honestly,
99.925	I felt a little uncomfortable
102.43	hearing that from someone
102.43	I didn't know very well;
104.862	it felt sort of intimate.
106.277	But it got my attention,
106.277	and so I did some research.
110.825	Now the thing about total eclipses is,
112.896	if you wait for one to come to you,
115.306	you're going to be waiting a long time.
118.722	Any given point on earth
118.722	experiences a total eclipse
123.266	about once every 400 years.
127.244	But if you're willing to travel,
127.244	you don't have to wait that long.
130.77	And so I learned
130.77	that a few years later, in 1998,
135.111	a total eclipse was going
135.111	to cross the Caribbean.
139.021	Now, a total eclipse is visible
139.021	only along a narrow path,
142.574	about a hundred miles wide,
144.278	and that's where the moon's shadow falls.
146.396	"It's called the ""path of totality."""
148.551	And in February 1998,
150.998	the path of totality
150.998	was going to cross Aruba.
154.469	So I talked to my husband,
154.469	and we thought: February? Aruba?
158.809	Sounded like a good idea anyway.
160.552	(Laughter)
161.648	So we headed south,
164.307	to enjoy the sun
164.307	and to see what would happen
166.803	when the sun briefly went away.
169.356	Well, the day of the eclipse
169.356	found us and many other people
172.371	out behind the Hyatt Regency,
174.576	on the beach,
175.763	waiting for the show to begin.
177.498	And we wore eclipse glasses
177.498	with cardboard frames
180.693	and really dark lenses that enabled us
180.693	to look at the sun safely.
185.787	A total eclipse begins
185.787	as a partial eclipse,
190.046	as the moon very slowly makes its way
190.046	in front of the sun.
193.846	So first it looked the sun
193.846	had a little notch in its edge,
198.098	and then that notch grew
198.098	larger and larger,
201.243	turning the sun into a crescent.
204.064	And it was all very interesting,
204.064	but I wouldn't say it was spectacular.
207.423	I mean, the day remained bright.
209.371	If I hadn't known
209.371	what was going on overhead,
212.405	I wouldn't have noticed anything unusual.
215.872	Well, about 10 minutes before
215.872	the total solar eclipse was set to begin,
220.706	weird things started to happen.
223.754	A cool wind kicked up.
226.628	Daylight looked odd,
226.628	and shadows became very strange;
230.565	they looked bizarrely sharp,
232.823	as if someone had turned up
232.823	the contrast knob on the TV.
237.587	Then I looked offshore,
237.587	and I noticed running lights on boats,
241.478	so clearly it was getting dark,
244.065	although I hadn't realized it.
245.675	Well soon, it was obvious
245.675	it was getting dark.
247.972	It felt like my eyesight was failing.
251.006	And then all of a sudden,
252.804	the lights went out.
255.65	Well, at that,
257.312	a cheer erupted from the beach,
259.953	and I took off my eclipse glasses,
261.87	because at this point
261.87	during the total eclipse,
264.485	it was safe to look at the sun
264.485	with the naked eye.
268.185	And I glanced upward,
271.826	and I was just dumbstruck.
277.361	Now, consider that, at this point,
277.361	I was in my mid-30s.
282.122	I had lived on earth long enough
282.122	to know what the sky looks like.
289.489	I mean --
290.664	(Laughter)
291.77	I'd seen blue skies and grey skies
294.888	and starry skies and angry skies
298.853	and pink skies at sunrise.
301.702	But here was a sky I had never seen.
306.137	First, there were the colors.
308.437	Up above, it was a deep purple-grey,
311.426	like twilight.
312.863	But on the horizon it was orange,
314.597	like sunset,
318.246	And up above, in the twilight,
320.912	bright stars and planets had come out.
323.361	So there was Jupiter
324.987	and there was Mercury
326.747	and there was Venus.
328.91	They were all in a line.
332.348	And there, along this line,
336.108	was this thing,
338.598	this glorious, bewildering thing.
342.146	It looked like a wreath
342.146	woven from silvery thread,
346.921	and it just hung out there
346.921	in space, shimmering.
352.322	That was the sun's outer atmosphere,
355.986	the solar corona.
357.819	And pictures just don't do it justice.
360.202	It's not just a ring or halo
360.202	around the sun;
364.759	it's finely textured,
364.759	like it's made out of strands of silk.
369.583	And although it looked
369.583	nothing like our sun,
372.108	of course, I knew that's what it was.
374.386	So there was the sun,
374.386	and there were the planets,
378.242	and I could see how the planets
378.242	revolve around the sun.
382.297	It's like I had left our solar system
385.106	and was standing on some alien world,
387.726	looking back at creation.
390.599	And for the first time in my life,
393.014	I just felt viscerally connected
393.014	to the universe
397.06	in all of its immensity.
399.927	Time stopped,
402.207	or it just kind of felt nonexistent,
404.779	and what I beheld with my eyes --
407.887	I didn't just see it,
410.255	it felt like a vision.
413.678	And I stood there in this nirvana
417.35	for all of 174 seconds --
417.35	less than three minutes --
423.01	when all of a sudden, it was over.
425.417	The sun burst out,
426.792	the blue sky returned,
428.478	the stars and the planets
428.478	and the corona were gone.
431.679	The world returned to normal.
434.393	But I had changed.
437.439	And that's how I became an umbraphile --
441.401	an eclipse chaser.
442.591	(Laughter)
443.624	So, this is how I spend my time
443.624	and hard-earned money.
448.818	Every couple of years, I head off
448.818	to wherever the moon's shadow will fall
454.471	to experience another couple minutes
456.885	of cosmic bliss,
458.369	and to share the experience with others:
460.68	with friends in Australia,
462.711	with an entire city in Germany.
465.288	In 1999, in Munich,
465.288	I joined hundreds of thousands
469.65	who filled the streets and the rooftops
469.65	and cheered in unison
474.435	as the solar corona emerged.
477.539	And over time, I've become something else:
480.318	an eclipse evangelist.
482.936	I see it as my job
485.557	to pay forward the advice
485.557	that I received all those years ago.
491.189	And so let me tell you:
494.35	before you die,
496.607	you owe it to yourself
496.607	to experience a total solar eclipse.
501.609	It is the ultimate experience of awe.
506.601	"Now, that word, ""awesome,"""
506.601	has grown so overused
511.208	that it's lost its original meaning.
513.396	True awe, a sense of wonder
513.396	and insignificance
517.899	in the face of something
517.899	enormous and grand,
520.454	is rare in our lives.
522.469	But when you experience it, it's powerful.
526.304	Awe dissolves the ego.
528.683	It makes us feel connected.
530.701	Indeed, it promotes
530.701	empathy and generosity.
534.74	Well, there is nothing truly more awesome
534.74	than a total solar eclipse.
540.317	Unfortunately, few Americans
540.317	have seen one,
542.726	because it's been 38 years
544.97	since one last touched
544.97	the continental United States
548.164	and 99 years since one last crossed
548.164	the breadth of the nation.
552.976	But that is about to change.
555.567	Over the next 35 years,
558.674	five total solar eclipses will visit
558.674	the continental United States,
562.982	and three of them
562.982	will be especially grand.
566.966	Six weeks from now, on August 21, 2017 --
571.664	(Applause)
574.367	the moon's shadow will race
574.367	from Oregon to South Carolina.
579.116	April 8, 2024, the moon's shadow
579.116	heads north from Texas to Maine.
584.543	In 2045, on August 12,
586.739	the path cuts from California to Florida.
591.278	I say:
593.493	What if we made these holidays?
596.108	What if we --
597.338	(Laughter)
598.39	(Applause)
602.096	What if we all stood together,
607.177	as many people as possible,
609.277	in the shadow of the moon?
611.073	Just maybe, this shared experience of awe
611.073	would help heal our divisions,
616.937	get us to treat each other
616.937	just a bit more humanely.
620.738	Now, admittedly, some folks consider
620.738	my evangelizing a little out there;
626.588	my obsession, eccentric.
629.812	I mean, why focus so much attention
629.812	on something so brief?
634.716	Why cross the globe --
634.716	or state lines, for that matter --
638.442	for something that lasts three minutes?
642.985	As I said:
644.726	I am not a spiritual person.
647.826	I don't believe in God.
650.421	I wish I did.
652.712	But when I think of my own mortality --
655.693	and I do, a lot --
658.791	when I think of everyone I have lost,
662.395	my mother in particular,
665.598	what soothes me
667.422	is that moment of awe I had in Aruba.
671.416	I picture myself on that beach,
674.556	looking at that sky,
676.857	and I remember how I felt.
680.481	My existence may be temporary,
683.798	but that's OK because, my gosh,
686.329	look at what I'm a part of.
690.034	And so this is a lesson I've learned,
692.187	and it's one that applies
692.187	to life in general:
695.62	duration of experience
695.62	does not equal impact.
700.049	One weekend, one conversation --
700.049	hell, one glance --
705.253	can change everything.
708.328	Cherish those moments
708.328	of deep connection with other people,
711.838	with the natural world,
713.273	and make them a priority.
715.036	Yes, I chase eclipses.
717.474	You might chase something else.
719.515	But it's not about the 174 seconds.
724.132	It's about how they change
726.844	the years that come after.
728.934	Thank you.
730.128	(Applause)
