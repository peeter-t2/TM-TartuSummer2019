12.58	Melati Wijsen: Bali -- island of gods.
17.301	Isabel Wijsen: A green paradise.
21.139	MW: Or ...
22.576	a paradise lost.
25.075	Bali:
26.696	island of garbage.
29.707	IW: In Bali,
30.883	we generate 680 cubic meters
30.883	of plastic garbage a day.
37.801	That's about a 14-story building.
41.205	And when it comes to plastic bags,
43.45	less than five percent gets recycled.
46.9	MW: We know that changes the image
46.9	you may have of our island.
50.666	It changed ours, too,
50.666	when we learned about it,
53.174	when we learned that almost all
53.174	plastic bags in Bali end up in our drains
57.759	and then in our rivers
59.033	and then in our ocean.
60.9	And those that don't even
60.9	make it to the ocean,
63.388	they're either burned or littered.
66.183	IW: So we decided
66.183	to do something about it.
68.812	And we've been working
68.812	for almost three years now
71.335	to try to say no to plastic bags
71.335	on our home island.
74.711	And we have had
74.711	some significant successes.
78.835	MW: We are sisters,
80.891	and we go to the best school on earth:
84.061	Green School, Bali.
85.61	Green School is not only different
85.61	in the way that it is built out of bamboo,
90.257	but also in the way that it teaches.
92.864	We are taught to become leaders of today,
96.518	something a normal textbook cannot match.
99.813	IW: One day we had a lesson in class
101.858	where we learned about significant people,
104.595	like Nelson Mandela,
106.107	Lady Diana
107.282	and Mahatma Gandhi.
109.244	Walking home that day,
110.425	we agreed that we also
110.425	wanted to be significant.
114.614	Why should we wait until we were grown up
116.675	to be significant?
118.42	We wanted to do something now.
121.135	MW: Sitting on the sofa that night,
122.859	we brainstormed and thought
122.859	of all the issues facing Bali.
126.332	And one thing that stood out
126.332	to us the most
128.42	was the plastic garbage.
130.536	But that is a huge problem.
133.189	So we looked into what was
133.189	a realistic target for us kids:
137.589	plastic bags.
138.844	And the idea was born.
140.983	IW: We started researching,
142.988	and let's just say, the more we learned,
145.952	there was nothing good about plastic bags.
149.401	And you know what?
150.695	We don't even need them.
153.003	MW: We were really inspired
153.003	by the efforts to say no to plastic bags
156.568	in many other places,
158.462	from Hawaii to Rwanda
160.468	and to severals cities
160.468	like Oakland and Dublin.
163.784	IW: And so the idea turned into the launch
163.784	"of ""Bye Bye Plastic Bags."""
170.658	MW: In the years
170.658	that we have been campaigning,
172.874	we have learned a lot.
175.984	Lesson number one:
178.233	you cannot do it all by yourself.
180.415	You need a big team of like-minded kids,
182.631	and so we formed
182.631	the Bye Bye Plastic Bags crew.
186.459	The volunteer team includes
186.459	children from all over the island,
189.598	from both international and local schools.
192.505	And together with them,
193.68	we started a multi-layered approach,
195.454	based on an on- and off-line
195.454	signature petition,
198.774	educational and inspirational
198.774	presentations at schools
202.234	and we raise general awareness
202.234	at markets, festivals, beach clean-ups.
206.743	And last but not least,
207.918	we distribute alternative bags,
209.988	bags like net bags,
211.736	recycled newspaper bags
213.082	or 100 percent organic material bags,
215.826	all made by local
215.826	initiatives on the island.
218.898	IW: We run a pilot village,
220.316	home of 800 families.
222.952	The village mayor was our first friend
224.799	and he loved our T-shirts, so that helped.
228.077	We focused on making the customers aware,
230.769	because that's where the change
230.769	needs to happen.
234.266	The village is already
234.266	two-thirds along the way
236.487	of becoming plastic bag free.
239.33	Our first attempts to get the government
239.33	of Bali on board failed.
244.696	So we thought,
246.391	"""Hmm ... a petition"
246.391	with one million signatures.
250.715	"They can't ignore us, right?"""
252.732	MW: Right!
254.258	IW: But, who would have guessed
256.117	one million signatures is, like,
256.117	a thousand times a thousand?
260.303	(Laughter)
262.27	We got stuck --
264.747	till we learned lesson number two:
267.507	think outside the box.
269.808	Someone mentioned
270.983	that the Bali airport handles
278.294	MW: But how do we get into the airport?
281.993	And here comes lesson number three:
284.236	persistence.
286.141	Off we headed to the airport.
287.792	We got past the janitor.
289.819	And then it was his boss's boss,
291.729	and then the assistant office manager,
294.014	and then the office manager,
295.423	and then ...
296.618	we got shuffled down
296.618	two levels and thought,
298.789	well, here comes the janitor again.
301.537	And after several days knocking on doors
303.609	and just being kids on a mission,
305.949	we finally got to the commercial
305.949	manager of Bali airports.
310.368	"And we gave him the ""Bali of plastic bags"""
310.368	speech, and being a very nice man,
314.305	he said, [imitating the man's voice]
314.305	"""I cannot believe what I'm about say,"
318.027	but I'm going to give authorization
320.294	to collect signatures
320.294	"behind customs and immigrations."""
323.275	(Laughter)
324.643	(Applause)
328.962	IW: In our first hour and a half there,
330.93	we got almost 1,000 signatures.
333.954	How cool is that?
336.34	Lesson number four:
337.875	you need champions
337.875	at all levels of society,
341.486	from students to commercial
341.486	managers to famous people.
346.097	And thanks to the attraction
346.097	of Green School,
348.233	we had access to a steady
348.233	stream of celebrities.
351.937	Ban Ki Moon taught us
353.16	that Secretary-Generals
353.16	of the United Nations
356.545	don't sign petitions --
358.22	(Laughter)
359.245	even if kids ask nicely.
361.106	But he promised to spread the word,
362.815	and now we work closely
362.815	with the United Nations.
365.701	MW: Jane Goodall taught us
365.701	the power of a people's network.
369.055	She started with just one
369.055	Roots &amp; Shoots group
372.119	and now she has 4,000 groups
372.119	around the world.
375.434	We are one of them.
376.631	She's a real inspiration.
378.731	If you're a fellow Rotarian,
380.507	nice to meet you.
381.821	We're Interactors,
382.996	the youngest department
382.996	of Rotary International.
386.573	IW: But we have also learned
386.573	much about patience,
389.84	MW: how to deal with frustrations,
392.121	IW: leadership,
393.296	MW: teamwork,
394.489	IW: friendship,
395.664	MW: we learned more
395.664	about the Balinese and their culture
398.347	IW: and we learned
398.347	about the importance of commitment.
402.106	MW: It's not always easy.
403.864	Sometimes it does get
403.864	a little bit hard to walk your talk.
407.83	IW: But last year, we did exactly that.
410.663	We went to India to give a talk,
412.29	and our parents took us to visit
413.869	the former private house
413.869	of Mahatma Gandhi.
417.216	We learned about the power
417.216	of hunger strikes
419.494	he did to reach his goals.
421.329	Yes, by the end of the tour,
423.351	when we met our parents again,
425.026	we both made a decision and said,
426.716	"""We're going on a hunger strike!"""
428.496	(Laughter)
429.521	MW: And you can probably
429.521	imagine their faces.
432.444	It took a lot of convincing,
434.746	and not only to our parents
436.502	but to our friends
436.502	and to our teachers as well.
439.561	Isabel and I were serious
439.561	about doing this.
442.556	So we met with a nutritionist,
444.189	and we came up with a compromise
446.053	of not eating from sunrise
446.053	to sunset every day
450.342	until the governor of Bali
450.342	would agree to meet with us
452.971	to talk about how to stop
452.971	plastic bags on Bali.
457.118	"IW: Our ""mogak makan,"""
457.118	as it is called in Bahasa Indonesia,
461.162	started.
462.337	We used social media to support our goal
464.35	and already on day two,
466.141	police started to come
466.141	to our home and school.
468.724	What were these two girls doing?
471.466	We knew we weren't making
471.466	the governor look his best
474	by doing this food strike --
475.905	we could have gone to jail.
477.768	But, hey, it worked.
479.721	Twenty-four hours later,
480.971	we were picked up from school
482.407	and escorted to the office
482.407	of the governor.
485.283	MW: And there he was --
486.82	(Applause)
489.053	waiting for us to meet and speak,
491.007	being all supportive
491.007	and thankful for our willingness
493.581	to care for the beauty
493.581	and the environment of Bali.
496.812	He signed a promise
497.987	to help the people of Bali
497.987	say no to plastic bags.
500.762	And we are now friends,
501.94	and on a regular basis,
503.36	we remind him and his team
503.36	of the promises he has made.
507.372	And indeed,
508.547	recently he stated and committed
510.477	that Bali will be
510.477	plastic bag free by 2018.
515.144	(Applause)
523.498	IW: Also, at the International Airport
523.498	of Bali, one of our supporters
528.139	is planning to start
528.139	a plastic bag-free policy by 2016.
533.186	MW: Stop handing out free plastic bags
535.197	and bring in your own reusable bag
536.917	is our next message to change
536.917	that mindset of the public.
541.405	IW: Our short-term campaign,
543.126	"""One Island / One Voice,"""
544.582	is all about this.
546.04	We check and recognize
546.04	the shops and restaurants
548.743	that have declared themselves
548.743	a plastic bag-free zone,
551.61	and we put this sticker at their entrance
554.007	and publish their names on social media
556.349	and some important magazines on Bali.
558.829	And conversely,
560.004	that highlights those
560.004	who do not have the sticker.
562.853	(Laughter)
564.731	MW: So, why are we actually
564.731	telling you all of this?
568.673	Well, partly, it is because we are proud
570.615	of the results that,
570.615	together with our team,
572.71	we have been able to reach.
574.469	But also because along the way,
576.581	we have learned that kids can do things.
579.445	We can make things happen.
581.891	Isabel and I were only 10 and 12 years old
584.342	when we started this.
585.925	We never had a business plan,
588.002	nor a fixed strategy,
589.25	nor any hidden agendas --
591.193	just the idea in front of us
593.657	and a group of friends working with us.
596.195	All we wanted to do
596.195	was stop those plastic bags
598.465	from wrapping and suffocating
598.465	our beautiful home.
601.933	Kids have a boundless energy
603.665	and a motivation to be the change
603.665	the world needs.
608.454	IW: So to all the kids of this beautiful
608.454	but challenging world:
613.69	go for it!
614.868	Make that difference.
617.057	We're not telling you
617.057	it's going to be easy.
619.5	We're telling you
619.5	it's going to be worth it.
622.221	Us kids may only be 25 percent
622.221	of the world's population,
626.616	but we are 100 percent of the future.
631.05	MW: We still have a lot of work to do,
633.73	but know that we still not stop
635.419	until the first question asked
635.419	when arriving at the Bali airports will be
640.682	"Both: ""Welcome to Bali,"
642.04	"do you have nay plastic bags to declare?"""
644.231	(Laughter)
645.668	Om shanti shanti shanti om.
648.428	Thank you.
649.603	(Applause)
