15.26	Can geographic information
18.26	make you healthy?
22.26	In 2001 I got hit by a train.
26.26	My train was a heart attack.
29.26	I found myself in a hospital
31.26	in an intensive-care ward,
33.26	recuperating from emergency surgery.
36.26	And I suddenly realized something:
38.26	that I was completely in the dark.
41.26	"I started asking my questions, ""Well, why me?"""
43.26	"""Why now?"" ""Why here?"""
45.26	"""Could my doctor have warned me?"""
48.26	So, what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you
51.26	is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health.
56.26	Genetics, lifestyle and environment.
59.26	That's going to sort of contain our risks,
61.26	and if we manage those risks
63.26	we're going to live a good life and a good healthy life.
66.26	Well, I understand the genetics and lifestyle part.
70.26	And you know why I understand that?
72.26	Because my physicians constantly
75.26	ask me questions about this.
77.26	Have you ever had to fill out those long,
79.26	legal-size forms in your doctor's office?
82.26	I mean, if you're lucky enough you get to do it more than once, right?
85.26	(Laughter)
86.26	Do it over and over again. And they ask you questions
88.26	about your lifestyle and your family history,
91.26	your medication history, your surgical history,
95.26	your allergy history ... did I forget any history?
99.26	But this part of the equation I didn't really get,
103.26	and I don't think my physicians
106.26	really get this part of the equation.
108.26	What does that mean, my environment?
111.26	Well, it can mean a lot of things.
113.26	This is my life. These are my life places.
116.26	We all have these.
118.26	While I'm talking I'd like you to also be thinking about:
121.26	How many places have you lived?
124.26	Just think about that, you know, wander through
126.26	your life thinking about this.
128.26	And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places.
132.26	You spend it at rest and you spend it at work.
134.26	And if you're like me, you're in an airplane a good portion of your time
137.26	traveling some place.
139.26	So, it's not really simple
141.26	"when somebody asks you, ""Where do you live, where do you work,"
143.26	and where do you spend all your time?
145.26	And where do you expose yourselves to risks
148.26	"that maybe perhaps you don't even see?"""
152.26	Well, when I have done this on myself,
154.26	I always come to the conclusion
156.26	that I spend about 75 percent of my time
160.26	relatively in a small number of places.
163.26	And I don't wander far from that place
165.26	for a majority of my time,
167.26	even though I'm an extensive global trekker.
172.26	Now, I'm going to take you on a little journey here.
174.26	I started off in Scranton, Pennsylvania.
176.26	I don't know if anybody might hail from northeastern Pennsylvania,
179.26	but this is where I spent my first 19 years
182.26	with my little young lungs.
184.26	You know, breathing high concentrations here
187.26	of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide
189.26	and methane gas,
191.26	in unequal quantities -- 19 years of this.
194.26	And if you've been in that part of the country,
196.26	this is what those piles of burning, smoldering coal waste look like.
200.26	So then I decided to leave that part of the world,
203.26	and I was going to go to the mid-west.
206.26	OK, so I ended up in Louisville, Kentucky.
209.26	Well, I decided to be neighbors to a place called Rubbertown.
213.26	They manufacture plastics. They use large quantities chloroprene
216.26	and benzene.
218.26	Okay, I spent 25 years, in my middle-age lungs now,
223.26	breathing various concentrations of that.
226.26	And on a clear day it always looked like this, so you never saw it.
230.26	It was insidious and it was really happening.
233.26	Then I decided I had to get really smart,
235.26	I would take this job in the West Coast.
238.26	And I moved to Redlands California.
241.26	Very nice, and there
243.26	my older, senior lungs, as I like to call them,
247.26	I filled with particulate matter, carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone.
253.26	Okay? Almost like the highest in the nation.
255.26	Alright, this is what it looks like on a good day.
257.26	If you've been there, you know what I'm talking about.
260.26	So, what's wrong with this picture?
263.26	Well, the picture is, there is a huge gap here.
265.26	The one thing that never happens in my doctor's office:
269.26	They never ask me about my place history.
272.26	No doctor, can I remember, ever asking me,
275.26	"""Where have you lived?"""
277.26	They haven't asked me what kind of the quality
279.26	of the drinking water that I put in my mouth
281.26	or the food that I ingest into my stomach.
285.26	They really don't do that. It's missing.
288.26	Look at the kind of data that's available.
291.26	This data's from all over the world --
293.26	countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research.
297.26	Now, I've circled the places where I've been.
300.26	Well, by design, if I wanted to have a heart attack
303.26	I'd been in the right places. Right?
308.26	So, how many people are in the white?
310.26	How many people in the room have spent the majority of their life
312.26	in the white space?
315.26	Anybody? Boy you're lucky.
317.26	How many have spent it in the red places?
320.26	Oh, not so lucky.
322.26	There are thousands of these kinds of maps
325.26	that are displayed in atlases
327.26	all over the world.
329.26	They give us some sense of what's going
331.26	to be our train wreck.
334.26	But none of that's in my medical record.
336.26	And it's not in yours either.
338.26	So, here's my friend Paul.
340.26	He's a colleague. He allowed his cell phone to be tracked
344.26	every two hours, 24/7,
349.26	for the last two years, everywhere he went.
352.26	And you can see he's been to a few places around the United States.
356.26	And this is where he has spent most of his time.
360.26	If you really studied that you might have some clues
363.26	as to what Paul likes to do.
366.26	Anybody got any clues? Ski. Right.
369.26	We can zoom in here, and we suddenly see
372.26	that now we see where Paul has really spent a majority of his time.
376.26	And all of those black dots are all of the
380.26	toxic release inventories
382.26	that are monitored by the EPA.
384.26	Did you know that data existed?
387.26	For every community in the United States,
389.26	you could have your own personalized map of that.
393.26	So, our cell phones can now build a place history.
396.26	This is how Paul did it. He did it with his iPhone.
399.26	This might be what we end up with.
401.26	This is what the physician would have
404.26	in front of him and her when we enter that exam room
407.26	instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter. Right?
411.26	This could be my little assessment.
413.26	And he looks at that and he says,
415.26	"""Whoa Bill,"
417.26	I suggest that maybe you not decide,
420.26	just because you're out here in beautiful California,
422.26	and it's warm every day,
424.26	that you get out and run at six o'clock at night.
427.26	I'd suggest that that's a bad idea Bill,
430.26	"because of this report."""
433.26	What I'd like to leave you for are two prescriptions.
437.26	Okay, number one is, we must teach physicians
439.26	about the value of geographical information.
443.26	It's called geomedicine. There are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now
447.26	that are focused on this.
449.26	And they're in the early stages of development.
452.26	These programs need to be supported,
455.26	and we need to teach our future
457.26	doctors of the world
459.26	the importance of some of the information
461.26	I've shared here with you today.
463.26	The second thing we need to do
465.26	is while we're spending billions and billions
467.26	of dollars all over the world
470.26	building an electronic health record,
472.26	we make sure we put a place history
474.26	inside that medical record.
477.26	It not only will be important for the physician;
480.26	it will be important for the researchers
482.26	that now will have huge samples to draw upon.
486.26	But it will also be useful for us.
488.26	I could have made the decision, if I had this information,
492.26	not to move to the ozone capital
495.26	of the United States, couldn't I? I could make that decision.
498.26	Or I could negotiate with my employer
500.26	to make that decision
502.26	in the best interest of myself and my company.
508.26	With that, I would like to just say that Jack Lord said
511.26	this almost 10 years ago.
514.26	Just look at that for a minute.
516.26	That was what the conclusion
518.26	of the Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare was about,
521.26	was saying that we can explain the geographic variations
524.26	that occur in disease, in illness, in wellness,
528.26	and how our healthcare system actually operates.
531.26	That was what he was talking about
533.26	on that quote.
535.26	And I would say he got it right almost a decade ago.
539.26	So, I'd very much like to see us begin to
541.26	really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records.
545.26	So with that, I'll leave you that
547.26	in my particular view of view of health:
551.26	Geography always matters.
553.26	And I believe that geographic information
555.26	can make both you and me very healthy. Thank you.
557.26	(Applause)
