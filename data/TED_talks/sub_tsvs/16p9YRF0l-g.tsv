16.433	I wanted to talk to you today
16.433	about creative confidence.
20.703	I'm going to start way back
20.703	in the third grade
23.871	at Oakdale School in Barberton, Ohio.
27.257	I remember one day my best friend
27.257	Brian was working on a project.
31.75	He was making a horse out of the clay
31.75	our teacher kept under the sink.
37.376	And at one point, one of the girls
37.376	that was sitting at his table,
40.959	seeing what he was doing,
40.959	leaned over and said to him,
44.597	"""That's terrible. That doesn't look"
44.597	"anything like a horse."""
49.025	And Brian's shoulders sank.
50.827	And he wadded up the clay horse
50.827	and he threw it back in the bin.
55.045	I never saw Brian do a project
55.045	like that ever again.
59.955	And I wonder how often
59.955	that happens, you know?
63.356	It seems like when I tell
63.356	that story of Brian to my class,
68.286	a lot of them want to come up after class
70.333	and tell me about
70.333	their similar experience,
72.374	how a teacher shut them down,
74.008	or how a student
74.008	was particularly cruel to them.
76.693	And then some kind of opt out
76.693	of thinking of themselves as creative
80.259	at that point.
82.415	And I see that opting out
82.415	that happens in childhood,
86.061	and it moves in and becomes
86.061	more ingrained, even,
89.38	by the time you get to adult life.
93.401	So we see a lot of this.
97.562	When we have a workshop
98.986	or when we have clients
98.986	in to work with us side by side,
101.756	eventually we get
101.756	to the point in the process
104.057	that's kind of fuzzy or unconventional.
107.003	And eventually, these big-shot executives
107.003	whip out their BlackBerrys
111.207	and they say they have to make
111.207	really important phone calls,
114.134	and they head for the exits.
116.278	And they're just so uncomfortable.
118.55	When we track them down
118.55	and ask them what's going on,
121.193	they say something like,
121.193	"""I'm just not the creative type."""
124.828	But we know that's not true.
126.963	If they stick with the process,
126.963	if they stick with it,
129.655	they end up doing amazing things.
131.9	And they surprise themselves
131.9	at just how innovative
134.874	they and their teams really are.
138.368	So I've been looking
138.368	at this fear of judgment that we have,
142.978	that you don't do things, you're afraid
142.978	you're going to be judged;
146.484	if you don't say the right creative thing,
146.484	you're going to be judged.
151.014	And I had a major breakthrough,
153	when I met the psychologist
153	Albert Bandura.
157.191	I don't know if you know Albert Bandura,
157.191	but if you go to Wikipedia,
160.492	it says that he's the fourth most
160.492	important psychologist in history --
164.658	you know, like Freud, Skinner,
164.658	somebody and Bandura.
168.391	(Laughter)
169.827	Bandura is 86 and he still
169.827	works at Stanford.
172.835	And he's just a lovely guy.
176.342	So I went to see him,
177.646	because he's just worked
177.646	on phobias for a long time,
181.172	which I'm very interested in.
182.629	He had developed this way,
186.891	this, kind of, methodology,
189.641	that ended up curing people
189.641	in a very short amount of time,
192.616	like, in four hours.
193.999	He had a huge cure rate
193.999	of people who had phobias.
197.459	And we talked about snakes
197.459	-- I don't know why --
200.447	we talked about snakes
200.447	and fear of snakes as a phobia.
205.531	And it was really enjoyable,
205.531	really interesting.
208.511	He told me that he'd invite
208.511	the test subject in,
213.478	"and he'd say, ""You know,"
213.478	there's a snake in the next room
216.389	"and we're going to go in there."""
219.681	To which, he reported,
219.681	most of them replied,
221.845	"""Hell no! I'm not going in there,"
221.845	"certainly if there's a snake in there."""
226.649	But Bandura has a step-by-step
226.649	process that was super successful.
230.973	So he'd take people to this two-way mirror
233.903	looking into the room where the snake was.
236.628	And he'd get them comfortable with that.
238.692	Then through a series of steps,
240.272	he'd move them and they'd be standing
240.272	in the doorway with the door open,
243.981	and they'd be looking in there.
245.519	And he'd get them comfortable with that.
247.49	And then many more steps
247.49	later, baby steps,
250.204	they'd be in the room, they'd have
250.204	a leather glove like a welder's glove on,
254.3	and they'd eventually touch the snake.
257.835	And when they touched the snake,
257.835	everything was fine. They were cured.
262.463	In fact, everything was better than fine.
264.607	These people who had
264.607	lifelong fears of snakes
268.479	were saying things like,
270.656	"""Look how beautiful that snake is."""
272.658	And they were holding it in their laps.
276.933	Bandura calls this process
276.933	"""guided mastery."""
280.842	I love that term: guided mastery.
284.341	And something else happened.
286.482	These people who went through the process
286.482	and touched the snake
290.008	ended up having less anxiety
290.008	about other things in their lives.
294.779	They tried harder, they persevered longer,
297.375	and they were more resilient
297.375	in the face of failure.
301.088	They just gained a new confidence.
305.399	And Bandura calls
305.399	"that confidence ""self-efficacy,"""
309.859	the sense that you can change the world
312.771	and that you can attain
312.771	what you set out to do.
316.717	Well, meeting Bandura
316.717	was really cathartic for me,
319.505	because I realized
319.505	that this famous scientist
323.062	had documented
323.062	and scientifically validated
326.246	something that we've seen happen
326.246	for the last 30 years:
329.661	that we could take people who had the fear
329.661	that they weren't creative,
333.474	and we could take them
333.474	through a series of steps,
336.224	kind of like a series of small successes,
339.644	and they turn fear into familiarity.
343.575	And they surprise themselves.
345.074	That transformation is amazing.
347.101	We see it at the d.school all the time.
349.521	People from all different
349.521	kinds of disciplines,
352.251	they think of themselves
352.251	as only analytical.
354.766	And they come in and they go
354.766	through the process, our process,
358.294	they build confidence and now
358.294	they think of themselves differently.
361.5	And they're totally emotionally excited
361.5	about the fact that they walk around
366.589	thinking of themselves
366.589	as a creative person.
370.826	So I thought one
370.826	of the things I'd do today
372.906	is take you through and show you
372.906	what this journey looks like.
376.738	To me, that journey looks like Doug Dietz.
383.486	Doug Dietz is a technical person.
385.424	He designs large
385.424	medical imaging equipment.
389.692	He's worked for GE, and he's had
389.692	a fantastic career.
393.502	But at one point,
393.502	he had a moment of crisis.
396.326	He was in the hospital looking
396.326	at one of his MRI machines in use,
400.423	when he saw a young family,
400.423	and this little girl.
404.047	And that little girl was crying
404.047	and was terrified.
407.523	And Doug was really disappointed to learn
410.902	that nearly 80 percent
410.902	of the pediatric patients in this hospital
414.781	had to be sedated in order
414.781	to deal with his MRI machine.
420.325	And this was really disappointing to Doug,
422.428	because before this time,
422.428	he was proud of what he did.
425.105	He was saving lives with this machine.
427.697	But it really hurt him to see the fear
427.697	that this machine caused in kids.
432.698	About that time, he was at the d.school
432.698	at Stanford taking classes.
437.182	He was learning about our process,
437.182	about design thinking, about empathy,
441.857	about iterative prototyping.
443.706	And he would take this new knowledge
443.706	and do something quite extraordinary.
448.419	He would redesign the entire experience
452.18	of being scanned.
453.82	And this is what he came up with.
455.443	(Laughter)
456.486	He turned it into
456.486	an adventure for the kids.
459.083	He painted the walls
459.083	and he painted the machine,
461.365	and he got the operators retrained
461.365	by people who know kids,
464.168	like children's museum people.
466.702	And now when the kid comes,
466.702	it's an experience.
470.424	And they talk to them about the noise
470.424	and the movement of the ship.
474.054	And when they come, they say,
475.475	"""OK, you're going to go"
475.475	into the pirate ship,
477.626	but be very still, because we don't want
477.626	"the pirates to find you."""
482.574	And the results were super dramatic:
486.234	from something like 80 percent
486.234	of the kids needing to be sedated,
489.408	to something like 10 percent
489.408	of the kids needing to be sedated.
493.686	And the hospital and GE were happy, too,
495.749	because you didn't have to call
495.749	the anesthesiologist all the time,
498.932	and they could put more kids
498.932	through the machine in a day.
501.764	So the quantitative results were great.
503.695	But Doug's results that he cared about
503.695	were much more qualitative.
507.723	He was with one of the mothers
509.473	waiting for her child
509.473	to come out of the scan.
511.807	And when the little girl
511.807	came out of her scan,
514.197	she ran up to her mother and said,
516.117	"""Mommy, can we come back tomorrow?"""
518.081	(Laughter)
521.306	And so, I've heard Doug tell
521.306	the story many times
524.751	of his personal transformation
527.061	and the breakthrough design
527.061	that happened from it,
530.431	but I've never really seen him
530.431	tell the story of the little girl
533.566	without a tear in his eye.
535.315	Doug's story takes place in a hospital.
538.281	I know a thing or two about hospitals.
541.73	A few years ago, I felt a lump
541.73	on the side of my neck.
546.471	It was my turn in the MRI machine.
549.224	It was cancer, it was the bad kind.
552.208	I was told I had a 40 percent
552.208	chance of survival.
556.163	So while you're sitting
556.163	around with the other patients,
559.093	in your pajamas,
560.341	and everybody's pale and thin --
562.393	(Laughter)
563.433	you know? -- and you're waiting
563.433	for your turn to get the gamma rays,
566.722	you think of a lot of things.
568.398	Mostly, you think about:
568.398	Am I going to survive?
571.641	And I thought a lot about:
572.933	What was my daughter's life
572.933	going to be like without me?
577.756	But you think about other things.
580.198	I thought a lot about:
580.198	What was I put on Earth to do?
583.208	What was my calling? What should I do?
586.623	I was lucky because I had lots of options.
588.695	We'd been working in health and wellness,
590.678	and K-12, and the developing world.
592.8	so there were lots of projects
592.8	that I could work on.
595.872	But then I decided
595.872	and committed at this point,
598.214	to the thing I most wanted to do,
601.494	which was to help as many
601.494	people as possible
605.209	regain the creative confidence
605.209	they lost along their way.
609.082	And if I was going to survive,
609.082	that's what I wanted to do.
611.93	I survived, just so you know.
613.415	(Laughter)
615.51	(Applause)
622.243	I really believe that when people
622.243	gain this confidence --
626.172	and we see it all the time
626.172	at the d.school and at IDEO --
629.197	that they actually start
629.197	working on the things
632.019	that are really important in their lives.
634.03	We see people quit what they're doing
634.03	and go in new directions.
637.765	We see them come up with more
637.765	interesting -- and just more -- ideas,
644.238	so they can choose from better ideas.
647.165	And they just make better decisions.
649.758	I know at TED, you're supposed to have
649.758	a change-the-world kind of thing,
653.275	isn't that -- everybody has
653.275	a change-the-world thing?
655.999	If there is one for me, this is it,
655.999	to help this happen.
659.15	So I hope you'll join me on my quest,
661.914	you as, kind of, thought leaders.
663.548	It would be really great if you didn't let
663.548	people divide the world
667.813	into the creatives and the non-creatives,
667.813	like it's some God-given thing,
671.799	and to have people realize
671.799	that they're naturally creative,
676.309	and that those natural people
676.309	should let their ideas fly;
680.925	that they should achieve
680.925	what Bandura calls self-efficacy,
685.125	that you can do what you set out to do,
688.412	and that you can reach a place
688.412	of creative confidence
692.124	and touch the snake.
693.832	Thank you.
695.008	(Applause)
