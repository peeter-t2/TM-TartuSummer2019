16.08	So, I'm an artist.
17.728	I live in New York, and I've been working in advertising
20.182	for -- ever since I left school,
22.827	so about seven, eight years now,
24.448	and it was draining.
26.004	I worked a lot of late nights. I worked a lot of weekends,
28.717	and I found myself never having time for all the projects
31.887	that I wanted to work on on my own.
34.189	And one day I was at work and I saw a talk
36.151	by Stefan Sagmeister on TED,
38.382	"and it was called ""The power of time off,"""
40.037	and he spoke about how every seven years,
42.673	he takes a year off from work so he could
44.78	do his own creative projects, and I was instantly inspired,
48.445	"and I just said, ""I have to do that. I have to take a year off."
51.834	I need to take time to travel and spend time with my family
56.313	"and start my own creative ideas."""
58.599	So the first of those projects ended up being
62.238	"something I called ""One Second Every Day."""
65.804	Basically I'm recording one second of every day of my life
68.138	for the rest of my life,
70.873	chronologically compiling these one-second
73.81	tiny slices of my life into one single continuous video
78.112	until, you know, I can't record them anymore.
83.789	The purpose of this project is, one:
86.146	I hate not remembering things that I've done in the past.
90.87	There's all these things that I've done with my life
93.58	that I have no recollection of
95.494	unless someone brings it up, and sometimes I think,
97.21	"""Oh yeah, that's something that I did."""
100.781	And something that I realized early on in the project
102.422	was that if I wasn't doing anything interesting,
105.146	I would probably forget to record the video.
107.625	So the day -- the first time that I forgot, it really hurt me,
111.098	because it's something that I really wanted to --
113.573	from the moment that I turned 30, I wanted
115.769	to keep this project going until forever,
119.119	and having missed that one second, I realized,
121.565	it just kind of created this thing in my head
125.318	where I never forgot ever again.
130.858	So if I live to see 80 years of age,
133.857	I'm going to have a five-hour video
136.49	that encapsulates 50 years of my life.
139.239	When I turn 40, I'll have a one-hour video
141.631	that includes just my 30s.
146.868	This has really
148.396	invigorated me day-to-day, when I wake up,
151.671	to try and do something interesting with my day.
162.017	Now, one of the things that I have issues with is that,
165.525	as the days and weeks and months go by,
169.723	time just seems to start blurring
171.54	and blending into each other
173.462	and, you know, I hated that,
177.193	and visualization is the way to trigger memory.
190.252	You know, this project for me is a way for me
193.141	to bridge that gap and remember everything that I've done.
196.435	Even just this one second allows me to remember
199.002	everything else I did that one day.
201.279	It's difficult, sometimes, to pick that one second.
203.941	On a good day, I'll have maybe three or four seconds
207.125	that I really want to choose,
208.838	but I'll just have to narrow it down to one,
210.987	but even narrowing it down to that one allows me
212.951	to remember the other three anyway.
215.431	It's also kind of a protest, a personal protest,
218.972	against the culture we have now where people
221.367	just are at concerts with their cell phones out
223.809	recording the whole concert, and they're disturbing you.
225.958	They're not even enjoying the show.
227.193	They're watching the concert through their cell phone.
230.298	I hate that. I admittedly used to be that guy a little bit,
234.266	back in the day, and I've decided that the best way
237.084	for me to still capture and keep a visual memory of my life
242.665	and not be that person, is to just record that one second
245.751	that will allow me to trigger that memory of,
248.02	"""Yeah, that concert was amazing. I really loved that concert."""
251.395	And it just takes a quick, quick second.
256.813	I was on a three-month road trip this summer.
259.692	It was something that I've been dreaming about doing my whole life,
262.546	just driving around the U.S. and Canada
265.039	and just figuring out where to go the next day,
268.278	and it was kind of outstanding.
270.883	I actually ran out, I spent too much money on my road trip
274.595	for the savings that I had to take my year off,
277.585	so I had to, I went to Seattle and I spent some time
280.479	with friends working on a really neat project.
291.371	One of the reasons that I took my year off was to spend more time with my family,
295.131	and this really tragic thing happened where
298.541	my sister-in-law,
300.146	her intestine suddenly strangled one day,
303.582	and we took her to the emergency room,
306.36	and she was, she was in really bad shape.
309.652	We almost lost her a couple of times,
311.727	and I was there with my brother every day.
319.168	It helped me realize something else during this project,
321.944	is that recording that one second on a really bad day
328.459	is extremely difficult.
329.692	It's not -- we tend to take our cameras out when we're doing awesome things.
334.889	"Or we're, ""Oh, yeah, this party, let me take a picture."""
337.313	But we rarely do that when we're having a bad day,
340.315	and something horrible is happening.
342.196	And I found that it's actually been very, very important
345.616	to record even just that one second of a really bad moment.
349.16	It really helps you appreciate the good times.
352.861	It's not always a good day, so when you have a bad one,
357.148	I think it's important to remember it,
359.046	just as much as it is important to remember the [good] days.
372.74	Now one of the things that I do is I don't use any filters,
375.606	I don't use anything to -- I try to capture the moment
379.385	as much as possible as the way that I saw it with my own eyes.
385.012	I started a rule of first person perspective.
387.747	Early on, I think I had a couple of videos where
389.82	you would see me in it, but I realized that wasn't the way to go.
394.033	The way to really remember what I saw
395.88	was to record it as I actually saw it.
407.797	Now a couple of things that I have in my head about this project are,
412.059	wouldn't it be interesting if thousands of people were doing this?
418.034	I turned 31 last week, which is there.
424.289	I think it would be interesting to see
426.017	what everyone did with a project like this.
427.865	I think everyone would have a different interpretation of it.
429.857	I think everyone would benefit from just having that one second to remember every day.
434.595	Personally, I'm tired of forgetting,
437.446	and this is a really easy thing to do.
440.017	I mean, we all have HD-capable cameras in our pockets right now --
442.886	most people in this room, I bet --
444.716	and it's something that's --
446.306	I never want to forget another day that I've ever lived,
448.564	and this is my way of doing that,
450.845	and it'd be really interesting also to see,
453.63	if you could just type in on a website,
455.6	"""June 18, 2018,"""
458.806	and you would just see a stream of people's lives
461.157	on that particular day from all over the world.
462.851	And I don't know, I think this project has a lot of possibilities,
466.073	and I encourage you all to record just a small snippet of your life every day,
469.72	so you can never forget that that day, you lived.
471.567	Thank you.
473.271	(Applause)
