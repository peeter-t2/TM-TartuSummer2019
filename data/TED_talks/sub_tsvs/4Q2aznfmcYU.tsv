12.394	"""Give me liberty or give me death."""
15.999	When Patrick Henry, the governor of Virginia,
18.266	said these words in 1775,
21.191	he could never have imagined
23.094	just how much they would come to resonate
25.159	with American generations to come.
28.182	At the time, these words were earmarked
30.847	and targeted against the British,
33.22	but over the last 200 years, they've come to embody
36.119	what many Westerners believe,
38.807	that freedom is the most cherished value,
42.255	and that the best systems of politics and economics
45.176	have freedom embedded in them.
47.39	Who could blame them?
49.184	Over the past hundred years, the combination
52.098	of liberal democracy and private capitalism
55.141	has helped to catapult the United States
57.561	and Western countries
58.822	to new levels of economic development.
61.235	In the United States over the past hundred years,
63.953	incomes have increased 30 times,
66.343	and hundreds of thousands of people
68.014	have been moved out of poverty.
70.287	Meanwhile, American ingenuity and innovation
74.32	has helped to spur industrialization
77.699	and also helped in the creation and the building
80.561	of things like household appliances
82.352	such as refrigerators and televisions,
84.575	motor vehicles and even the mobile phones in your pockets.
88.623	It's no surprise, then, that even at the depths
91.305	of the private capitalism crisis,
93.569	President Obama said,
95.336	"""The question before us is not whether the market"
98.232	is a force for good or ill.
100.867	Its power to generate wealth and to expand freedom
104.09	"is unmatched."""
106.168	Thus, there's understandably
108.057	a deep-seated presumption among Westerners
111.191	that the whole world will decide to adopt
114.001	private capitalism as the model of economic growth,
117.085	liberal democracy, and will continue
119.392	to prioritize political rights over economic rights.
123.523	However, to many who live in the emerging markets,
126.373	this is an illusion, and even though
129.337	the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
131.444	which was signed in 1948,
133.715	was unanimously adopted,
136.01	what it did was to mask a schism
138.701	that has emerged between developed
138.701	and developing countries,
142.224	and the ideological beliefs
144.305	between political and economic rights.
147.952	This schism has only grown wider.
151.489	Today, many people who live in the emerging markets,
154.059	where 90 percent of the world's population lives,
156.972	believe that the Western obsession
159	with political rights is beside the point,
161.627	and what is actually important
163.605	is delivering on food, shelter,
165.826	education and healthcare.
167.924	"""Give me liberty or give me death"""
170.34	is all well and good if you can afford it,
173.103	but if you're living on less than one dollar a day,
176.066	you're far too busy trying to survive
178.034	and to provide for your family
179.85	than to spend your time going around
181.381	trying to proclaim and defend democracy.
184.392	Now, I know many people in this room
186.239	and around the world will think,
188.427	"""Well actually, this is hard to grasp,"""
191.41	because private capitalism and liberal democracy
194.637	are held sacrosanct.
196.903	But I ask you today, what would you do
199.272	if you had to choose?
201.083	What if you had to choose
202.897	between a roof over your head
205.36	and the right to vote?
207.037	Over the last 10 years,
208.63	I've had the privilege to travel to over 60 countries,
212.41	many of them in the emerging markets,
214.615	in Latin America, Asia,
216.943	and my own continent of Africa.
219.625	I've met with presidents, dissidents,
222.265	policymakers, lawyers, teachers,
224.633	doctors and the man on the street,
226.936	and through these conversations,
228.619	it's become clear to me
230.419	that many people in the emerging markets
232.347	believe that there's actually a split occurring
235.556	between what people believe ideologically
238.322	in terms of politics and economics in the West
241.008	and that which people believe in the rest of the world.
243.892	Now, don't get me wrong.
245.763	I'm not saying people in the emerging markets
247.223	don't understand democracy,
249.314	nor am I saying that they wouldn't ideally
251.223	like to pick their presidents or their leaders.
253.708	Of course they would.
255.263	However, I am saying that on balance,
258.284	they worry more about
259.866	where their living standard improvements are going to come from,
262.897	and how it is their governments can deliver for them,
265.18	than whether or not the government
267.085	was elected by democracy.
270.025	The fact of the matter
272.114	is that this has become a very poignant question
274.579	because there is for the first time in a long time
276.912	a real challenge to the Western ideological systems
280.482	of politics and economics,
282.636	and this is a system that is embodied by China.
285.709	And rather than have private capitalism,
285.709	they have state capitalism.
289.687	Instead of liberal democracy,
289.687	they have de-prioritized the democratic system.
293.959	And they have also decided to prioritize
296.323	economic rights over political rights.
299.98	I put it to you today that it is this system
302.829	that is embodied by China
304.674	that is gathering momentum amongst people
306.634	in the emerging markets as the system to follow,
309.722	because they believe increasingly
311.742	that it is the system
313.417	that will promise the best and fastest improvements
316.818	in living standards in the shortest period of time.
320.429	If you will indulge me, I will spend a few moments
323.008	explaining to you first
324.83	why economically they've come to this belief.
328.86	First of all, it's China's economic performance
331.686	over the past 30 years.
333.728	She's been able to produce record economic growth
336.448	and meaningfully move many people out of poverty,
340.083	specifically putting a meaningful dent in poverty
343.262	by moving over 300 million people
346.076	out of indigence.
349.334	It's not just in economics,
351.848	but it's also in terms of living standards.
354.345	We see that in China, 28 percent of people
357.189	had secondary school access.
359.012	Today, it's closer to 82 percent.
361.389	So in its totality, economic improvement
363.984	has been quite significant.
366.68	Second, China has been able
369.716	to meaningfully improve its income inequality
372.852	without changing the political construct.
375.517	Today, the United States and China
377.947	are the two leading economies in the world.
380.473	They have vastly different political systems
382.722	and different economic systems,
385.044	one with private capitalism,
386.514	another one broadly with state capitalism.
388.953	However, these two countries
391.026	have the identical GINI Coefficient,
393.133	which is a measure of income equality.
395.68	Perhaps what is more disturbing
397.912	is that China's income equality
400.006	has been improving in recent times,
402.327	whereas that of the United States
403.944	has been declining.
407.007	Thirdly, people in the emerging markets
409.563	look at China's amazing and legendary
411.957	infrastructure rollout.
414.283	This is not just about China
415.942	building roads and ports and railways
418.302	in her own country --
419.738	she's been able to build 85,000 kilometers
422.826	of road network in China
424.417	and surpass that of the United States --
427.365	but even if you look to places like Africa,
430.176	China has been able to help tar the distance
433.233	of Cape Town to Cairo,
434.887	which is 9,000 miles,
436.512	or three times the distance of New York to California.
440.423	Now this is something that people can see and point to.
444.863	Perhaps it's no surprise
446.545	that in a 2007 Pew survey, when surveyed,
450.266	Africans in 10 countries said
452.134	they thought that the Chinese were doing
453.802	amazing things to improve their livelihoods
455.696	by wide margins, by as much as 98 percent.
460.194	Finally, China is also providing innovative solutions
464.714	to age-old social problems that the world faces.
468.085	If you travel to Mogadishu, Mexico City or Mumbai,
471.353	you find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics
474.605	continue to be a stumbling block
476.832	to the delivery of medicine and healthcare
478.933	in the rural areas.
480.803	However, through a network of state-owned enterprises,
483.681	the Chinese have been able to go into these rural areas,
486.577	using their companies
488.067	to help deliver on these healthcare solutions.
491.339	Ladies and gentlemen, it's no surprise
493.545	that around the world, people are pointing
493.545	at what China is doing and saying,
496.795	"""I like that. I want that."
498.937	I want to be able to do what China's doing.
501.131	"That is the system that seems to work."""
503.901	I'm here to also tell you
505.574	that there are lots of shifts occurring
507.321	around what China is doing
509.281	in the democratic stance.
511.356	In particular, there is growing doubt
514.021	among people in the emerging markets,
516.123	when people now believe that democracy
517.83	is no longer to be viewed
520.114	as a prerequisite for economic growth.
523.597	In fact, countries like Taiwan, Singapore, Chile,
527.838	not just China, have shown that actually,
530.746	it's economic growth that is a prerequisite
533.432	for democracy.
535.196	In a recent study, the evidence has shown
538.442	that income is the greatest determinant
540.94	of how long a democracy can last.
543.688	The study found that if your per capita income
546.421	is about 1,000 dollars a year,
548.633	your democracy will last about eight and a half years.
551.631	If your per capita income is between
553.349	2,000 and 4,000 dollars per year,
555.749	then you're likely to only get 33 years of democracy.
558.791	And only if your per capita income
560.615	is above 6,000 dollars a year
562.746	will you have democracy come hell or high water.
566.49	What this is telling us
568.202	is that we need to first establish a middle class
570.775	that is able to hold the government accountable.
573.892	But perhaps it's also telling us
576.267	that we should be worried about going
577.849	around the world and shoehorning democracy,
580.759	because ultimately we run the risk
582.569	of ending up with illiberal democracies,
584.699	democracies that in some sense
586.76	could be worse than the authoritarian governments
588.927	that they seek to replace.
592.614	The evidence around illiberal democracies
594.88	is quite depressing.
596.7	Freedom House finds that although 50 percent
599.146	of the world's countries today are democratic,
605.009	in the sense that people don't have free speech
607.362	or freedom of movement.
610.107	But also, we're finding from Freedom House
612.426	in a study that they published last year
614.547	that freedom has been on the decline
616.662	every year for the past seven years.
619.234	What this says
621.018	is that for people like me
622.356	who care about liberal democracy,
624.966	is we've got to find a more sustainable way
627.313	of ensuring that we have a sustainable form
629.658	of democracy in a liberal way,
631.859	and that has its roots in economics.
634.859	But it also says that as China moves
637.788	toward being the largest economy in the world,
640.32	something that is expected to happen
642.341	by experts in 2016,
644.416	that this schism between the political
646.686	and economic ideologies of the West and the rest
650.048	is likely to widen.
652.979	What might that world look like?
655.534	Well, the world could look like
657.096	more state involvement and state capitalism;
660.361	greater protectionisms of nation-states;
663.2	but also, as I just pointed out a moment ago,
665.709	ever-declining political rights
667.876	and individual rights.
669.937	The question that is left for us in general
672.699	is, what then should the West be doing?
675.815	And I suggest that they have two options.
678.52	The West can either compete or cooperate.
682.937	If the West chooses to compete with the Chinese model,
686.125	and in effect go around the world
688.132	and continue to try and push an agenda
690.459	of private capitalism and liberal democracy,
693.499	this is basically going against headwinds,
696.155	but it also would be a natural stance
698.179	for the West to take
699.64	because in many ways it is the antithesis
701.673	of the Chinese model
703.82	of de-prioritizing democracy, and state capitalism.
707.948	Now the fact of the matter is,
709.727	if the West decides to compete,
711.685	it will create a wider schism.
715.083	The other option is for the West to cooperate,
717.936	and by cooperating I mean
719.53	giving the emerging market countries the flexibility
723.04	to figure out in an organic way
725.087	what political and economic system
726.849	works best for them.
728.542	Now I'm sure some of you in the room
730.272	will be thinking, well, this is like ceding to China,
733.146	and this is a way, in other words,
735.217	for the West to take a back seat.
737.129	But I put it to you
738.584	that if the United States and European countries
740.934	want to remain globally influential,
743.585	they may have to consider cooperating
745.455	in the short term in order to compete,
748.004	and by that, they might have to focus
750.247	more aggressively on economic outcomes
753.482	to help create the middle class
755.191	and therefore be able to hold government accountable
757.862	and create the democracies that we really want.
761.889	The fact of the matter is that
764.478	instead of going around the world
766.381	and haranguing countries for engaging with China,
769.868	the West should be encouraging its own businesses
772.828	to trade and invest in these regions.
775.327	Instead of criticizing China for bad behavior,
779.579	the West should be showing how it is
782.179	that their own system of politics and economics
784.566	is the superior one.
786.716	And instead of shoehorning democracy
788.736	around the world,
790.227	perhaps the West should take a leaf
791.502	out of its own history book
793.354	and remember that it takes a lot of patience
796.204	in order to develop the models
797.774	and the systems that you have today.
800.107	Indeed, the Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer
803.579	reminds us that it took the United States
806.208	nearly 170 years
808.854	from the time that the Constitution was written
811.523	for there to be equal rights in the United States.
814.483	Some people would argue that today
815.845	there is still no equal rights.
817.359	In fact, there are groups who would argue
819.205	that they still do not have equal rights under the law.
824.533	At its very best,
826.115	the Western model speaks for itself.
828.367	It's the model that put food on the table.
830.528	It's the refrigerators.
832.119	It put a man on the moon.
834.151	But the fact of the matter is,
835.941	although people back in the day
837.591	used to point at the Western countries and say,
839.657	"""I want that, I like that,"""
841.7	there's now a new person in town
843.859	in the form of a country, China.
846.298	Today, generations are looking at China
848.384	"and saying, ""China can produce infrastructure,"
851.024	China can produce economic growth,
853.14	"and we like that."""
854.708	Because ultimately, the question before us,
857.422	and the question before
859.278	seven billion people on the planet
860.983	is, how can we create prosperity?
864.083	People who care and will pivot towards the model
866.998	of politics and economics
868.523	in a very rational way,
870.09	to those models that will ensure
872.555	that they can have better living standards
874.536	in the shortest period of time.
877.159	As you leave here today,
878.87	I would like to leave you
880.275	with a very personal message,
881.928	which is what it is that I believe
884.014	we should be doing as individuals,
886.418	and this is really about being open-minded,
889.787	open-minded to the fact that our hopes and dreams
893.126	of creating prosperity for people around the world,
896.361	creating and meaningfully putting a dent in poverty
899.285	for hundreds of millions of people,
900.961	has to be based in being open-minded,
903.745	because these systems have good things
905.972	and they have bad things.
908.449	Just to illustrate,
910.158	I went into my annals of myself.
912.644	That's a picture of me.
914.426	Awww. (Laughter)
916.666	I was born and raised in Zambia in 1969.
920.892	At the time of my birth,
922.839	blacks were not issued birth certificates,
924.921	and that law only changed in 1973.
927.265	This is an affidavit from the Zambian government.
930.41	I bring this to you to tell you that in 40 years,
932.862	I've gone from not being recognized as a human being
935.747	to standing in front of the illustrious TED crowd today
938.694	to talk to you about my views.
941.272	In this vein, we can increase economic growth.
944.996	We can meaningfully put a dent in poverty.
948.413	But also, it's going to require
950.614	that we look at our assumptions,
952.608	assumptions and strictures that we've grown up with
954.835	around democracy, around private capitalism,
956.814	around what creates economic growth
958.749	and reduces poverty and creates freedoms.
961.381	We might have to tear those books up
963.258	and start to look at other options
965.829	and be open-minded to seek the truth.
968.686	Ultimately, it's about transforming the world
970.933	and making it a better place.
972.619	Thank you very much.
974.837	(Applause)
