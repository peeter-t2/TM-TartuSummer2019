12.76	Five years ago, I had my dream job.
16.473	I was a foreign correspondent
16.473	in the Middle East
18.901	reporting for ABC News.
21.065	But there was a crack in the wall,
23.153	a problem with our industry,
25.559	that I felt we needed to fix.
28.401	You see, I got to the Middle East
28.401	right around the end of 2007,
32.566	which was just around the midpoint
34.847	of the Iraq War.
36.571	But by the time I got there,
36.571	it was already nearly impossible
40.044	to find stories about Iraq on air.
43.345	Coverage had dropped across the board,
45.619	across networks.
46.956	And of the stories that did make it,
49.036	more than 80 percent
49.036	of them were about us.
52.381	We were missing the stories about Iraq,
54.958	the people who live there,
57.075	and what was happening to them
57.075	under the weight of the war.
60.874	Afghanistan had already
60.874	fallen off the agenda.
64.654	There were less than one percent
64.654	of all news stories in 2008
68.319	that went to the war in Afghanistan.
70.582	It was the longest war in US history,
73.549	but information was so scarce
75.535	that schoolteachers we spoke to
77.794	told us they had trouble
77.794	explaining to their students
80.945	what we were doing there,
82.509	when those students had parents
84.43	who were fighting
84.43	and sometimes dying overseas.
88.997	We had drawn a blank,
90.685	and it wasn't just Iraq and Afghanistan.
93.491	From conflict zones to climate change
96.188	to all sorts of issues
96.188	around crises in public health,
100.498	we were missing what I call
100.498	the species-level issues,
103.918	because as a species,
103.918	they could actually sink us.
107.484	And by failing to understand
107.484	the complex issues of our time,
112.227	we were facing certain
112.227	practical implications.
115.585	How were we going to solve problems
117.361	that we didn't fundamentally understand,
119.656	that we couldn't track in real time,
121.944	and where the people working on the issues
124.282	were invisible to us
125.649	and sometimes invisible to each other?
129.46	When you look back on Iraq,
131.468	those years when we
131.468	were missing the story,
134.921	were the years when the society
134.921	was falling apart,
137.707	when we were setting the conditions
137.707	for what would become the rise of ISIS,
141.666	the ISIS takeover of Mosul
143.852	and terrorist violence that would spread
145.919	beyond Iraq's borders
145.919	to the rest of the world.
149.577	Just around that time
149.577	where I was making that observation,
152.908	I looked across the border of Iraq
154.774	and noticed there was another
154.774	story we were missing:
157.837	the war in Syria.
159.393	If you were a Middle-East specialist,
159.393	you knew that Syria was that important
164.133	from the start.
165.402	But it ended up being, really,
166.966	one of the forgotten stories
166.966	of the Arab Spring.
170.666	I saw the implications up front.
174.064	Syria is intimately tied
174.064	to regional security,
177.455	to global stability.
179.426	I felt like we couldn't let that become
181.339	another one of the stories we left behind.
184.322	So I left my big TV job to start
184.322	"a website, called ""Syria Deeply."""
190.125	It was designed to be a news
190.125	and information source
192.899	that made it easier to understand
192.899	a complex issue,
196.272	and for the past four years,
196.272	it's been a resource
198.665	for policymakers and professionals
198.665	working on the conflict in Syria.
203.76	We built a business model
205.207	based on consistent,
205.207	high-quality information,
208.486	and convening the top minds on the issue.
212.227	And we found it was a model that scaled.
215.091	We got passionate requests
215.091	"to do other things ""Deeply."""
218.895	So we started to work our way
218.895	down the list.
222.987	I'm just one of many entrepreneurs,
226.013	and we are just one of many start-ups
228.619	trying to fix what's wrong with news.
231.504	All of us in the trenches know
233.474	that something is wrong
233.474	with the news industry.
235.973	It's broken.
238.376	Trust in the media
238.376	has hit an all-time low.
241.747	And the statistic you're seeing up there
241.747	is from September --
245.166	it's arguably gotten worse.
247.924	But we can fix this.
249.42	We can fix the news.
252.083	I know that that's true.
253.926	You can call me an idealist;
253.926	I call myself an industrious optimist.
259.239	And I know there are
259.239	a lot of us out there.
261.788	We have ideas for how
261.788	to make things better,
264.204	and I want to share three of them
264.204	that we've picked up in our own work.
268.668	Idea number one:
270.481	we need news that's built
270.481	on deep-domain knowledge.
274.168	Given the waves and waves of layoffs
274.168	at newsrooms across the country,
277.95	we've lost the art of specialization.
280.252	Beat reporting is an endangered thing.
282.959	When it comes to foreign news,
285.23	the way we can fix that
285.23	is by working with more local journalists,
288.415	treating them like our partners
288.415	and collaborators,
290.82	not just fixers who fetch us
290.82	phone numbers and sound bites.
294.687	Our local reporters in Syria
294.687	and across Africa and across Asia
298.927	bring us stories that we certainly
298.927	would not have found on our own.
302.938	Like this one from the suburbs
302.938	of Damascus, about a wheelchair race
307.178	that gave hope
307.178	to those wounded in the war.
310.063	Or this one from Sierra Leone,
311.96	about a local chief
311.96	who curbed the spread of Ebola
315.441	by self-organizing
315.441	a quarantine in his district.
319.346	Or this one from the border of Pakistan,
321.496	about Afghan refugees being forced
321.496	to return home before they are ready,
325.449	under the threat of police intimidation.
328.525	Our local journalists are our mentors.
330.603	They teach us something new every day,
332.729	and they bring us stories
332.729	that are important for all of us to know.
337.45	Idea number two:
339.268	we need a kind of Hippocratic oath
339.268	for the news industry,
342.931	a pledge to first do no harm.
346.558	(Applause)
348.193	Journalists need to be tough.
349.735	We need to speak truth to power,
351.671	but we also need to be responsible.
353.796	We need to live up to our own ideals,
356.164	and we need to recognize
358.119	when what we're doing
358.119	could potentially harm society,
362.032	where we lose track of journalism
362.032	as a public service.
366.173	I watched us cover the Ebola crisis.
368.172	We launched Ebola Deeply. We did our best.
370.592	But what we saw was a public
372.522	that was flooded with hysterical
372.522	and sensational coverage,
376.163	sometimes inaccurate,
376.163	sometimes completely wrong.
379.332	Public health experts tell me
379.332	that that actually cost us in human lives,
383.984	because by sparking more panic
383.984	and by sometimes getting the facts wrong,
388.681	we made it harder for people to resolve
390.877	what was actually happening on the ground.
392.971	All that noise made it harder
392.971	to make the right decisions.
396.88	We can do better as an industry,
399.081	but it requires us recognizing
399.081	how we got it wrong last time,
403.47	and deciding not to go that way next time.
406.841	It's a choice.
408.081	We have to resist the temptation
408.081	to use fear for ratings.
412.403	And that decision has to be made
412.403	in the individual newsroom
415.334	and with the individual news executive.
417.529	Because the next deadly virus
417.529	that comes around
420.208	could be much worse
420.208	and the consequences much higher,
424.013	if we do what we did last time;
425.972	if our reporting isn't responsible
425.972	and it isn't right.
431.012	The third idea?
432.587	We need to embrace complexity
434.742	if we want to make sense
434.742	of a complex world.
437.956	Embrace complexity --
439.862	(Applause)
441.363	not treat the world simplistically,
441.363	because simple isn't accurate.
446.758	We live in a complex world.
449.281	News is adult education.
451.265	It's our job as journalists
451.265	to get elbow deep in complexity
454.744	and to find new ways to make it easier
454.744	for everyone else to understand.
459.447	If we don't do that,
460.64	if we pretend there are
460.64	just simple answers,
463.474	we're leading everyone off a steep cliff.
467.144	Understanding complexity
467.144	is the only way to know the real threats
470.619	that are around the corner.
471.976	It's our responsibility
471.976	to translate those threats
474.705	and to help you understand what's real,
476.914	so you can be prepared and know
476.914	what it takes to be ready
480.171	for what comes next.
482.825	I am an industrious optimist.
484.406	I do believe we can fix what's broken.
487.498	We all want to.
488.705	There are great journalists
488.705	out there doing great work --
491.513	we just need new formats.
493.862	I honestly believe
493.862	this is a time of reawakening,
497.607	reimagining what we can do.
499.899	I believe we can fix what's broken.
502.436	I know we can fix the news.
504.392	I know it's worth trying,
506.242	and I truly believe that in the end,
508.409	we're going to get this right.
510.051	Thank you.
511.243	(Applause)
