14.426	Mother Earth: Our end was imminent
17.674	yet finality relented.
20.47	Wind, water and fire gently revived;
24.497	you and I reconciled,
27.9	rhythms realigned,
29.98	the blues gone green.
32.301	Your care in conserving
32.301	in exchange for my fruit
36.654	and replenishing this picturous
36.654	restoring of painted skies,
42.762	mountains rolling,
44.617	forest covering --
46.261	no more warming.
48.247	The purity and simplicity
48.247	of how we used to be.
52.646	You remember me?
54.185	All I give to humanity?
56.877	Housing, land, seas, birds,
60.667	beast and all of mankind,
63.619	exclusively the interface
63.619	where you and the elements meet
69.153	and vibrate harmoniously.

278.484	My beauty altered,
279.688	muddied waters, fields stripped bare,
282.117	interior scarred beyond repair,
284.894	our memories eroding.
287.848	You once obsessed over my frame
290.357	and how I came to be;
291.728	my nature, its polarity --
294.167	how my sweet winds whisper softly,
294.167	yet assault seas.
299.871	You remember me?
301.365	All I give to humanity?
304.087	Housing, land, seas, birds,
307.948	beast and all of mankind --
311.042	exclusively the interface
311.042	where you and the elements meet
316.392	and vibrate harmoniously.
318.751	The unseen traveler forever passing,
322.55	carrying life,
324.061	moving,
325.284	awning of earth felt and heard,
328.752	strong and stirring,
331.284	blowing.
332.623	Breathe you in, cleansing wind,
335.992	gentle and still,
337.983	quieter.
339.339	The source eternally here,
342.025	ascent and descending:
345.15	air.
347.315	Rhythmic flow,
349.408	fluid and graceful,
351.494	waves of serenity,
353.682	smooth strings of purity,
355.832	rains replenishing rapidly,
359.735	rivers of dreams,
361.012	raging springs
361.012	covering earth in abundance,
363.663	universal solvent dissolving,
366.172	drink, liquid, life and power:
372.384	water.
374.1	Born when the universe was formed,
375.928	warmed mankind,
377.222	gave him light,
378.438	colored rays illuminate ember flickers
381.446	incandescent, powerful and brilliant.
383.557	Sacred son of air, father of fury,
385.938	heat dancing vigorously
387.389	between perfection and beauty.
389.26	Unconfined agility,
390.841	fast and fancy,
392.886	sparks of ingenuity rise:
396.087	fire.
