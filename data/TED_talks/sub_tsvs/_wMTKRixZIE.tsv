14.28	People returning to work
14.28	after a career break:
17.84	I call them relaunchers.
20.039	These are people who have taken
20.039	career breaks for elder care,
23.92	for childcare reasons,
25.76	pursuing a personal interest
27.48	or a personal health issue.
30.16	Closely related are
30.16	career transitioners of all kinds:
33.56	veterans, military spouses,
35.92	retirees coming out of retirement
38.36	or repatriating expats.
41.76	Returning to work
41.76	after a career break is hard
44.72	because of a disconnect
44.72	between the employers
47.76	and the relaunchers.
49.68	Employers can view hiring people
49.68	with a gap on their resume
53.68	as a high-risk proposition,
55.8	and individuals on career break
55.8	can have doubts about their abilities
59.68	to relaunch their careers,
61.28	especially if they've been out
61.28	for a long time.
64.32	This disconnect is a problem
64.32	that I'm trying to help solve.
69.64	Now, successful relaunchers
69.64	are everywhere and in every field.
74.68	This is Sami Kafala.
76.44	He's a nuclear physicist in the UK
79.2	who took a five-year career break
79.2	to be home with his five children.
84.16	The Singapore press recently wrote
84.16	about nurses returning to work
88.12	after long career breaks.
90.2	And speaking of long career breaks,
92.24	this is Mimi Kahn.
94.12	She's a social worker
94.12	in Orange County, California,
97.32	who returned to work
97.32	in a social services organization
100.68	after a 25-year career break.
103.48	That's the longest career break
103.48	that I'm aware of.
106.28	Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
108.84	took a five-year career break
108.84	early in her career.
112.72	And this is Tracy Shapiro,
112.72	who took a 13-year career break.
117.4	Tracy answered a call for essays
117.4	by the Today Show
121.36	from people who were trying
121.36	to return to work
123.8	but having a difficult time of it.
126.16	Tracy wrote in that she was a mom of five
126.16	who loved her time at home,
130.64	but she had gone through a divorce
130.64	and needed to return to work,
134.2	plus she really wanted
134.2	to bring work back into her life
137.16	because she loved working.
139.52	Tracy was doing what so many of us do
142.12	when we feel like we've put in
142.12	a good day in the job search.
145.88	She was looking for a finance
145.88	or accounting role,
148.88	and she had just spent
148.88	the last nine months
151.6	very diligently researching
151.6	companies online
154.92	and applying for jobs with no results.
158.12	I met Tracy in June of 2011,
161.88	when the Today Show asked me
161.88	if I could work with her
165.44	to see if I could help her
165.44	turn things around.
168.16	The first thing I told Tracy
168.16	was she had to get out of the house.
171.64	I told her she had to go public
171.64	with her job search
174.4	and tell everyone she knew
174.4	about her interest in returning to work.
178.68	"I also told her, ""You are going"
178.68	to have a lot of conversations
182.48	that don't go anywhere.
184.08	Expect that, and don't
184.08	be discouraged by it.
187.36	There will be a handful
188.96	that ultimately lead
188.96	"to a job opportunity."""
192.68	I'll tell you what happened
192.68	with Tracy in a little bit,
195.32	but I want to share with you
195.32	a discovery that I made
197.773	when I was returning to work
199.52	after my own career break of 11 years
199.52	out of the full-time workforce.
203.64	And that is, that people's view of you
203.64	is frozen in time.
209.32	What I mean by this is,
209.32	when you start to get in touch with people
213	and you get back in touch
213	with those people from the past,
215.76	the people with whom you worked
215.76	or went to school,
219.04	they are going to remember you as you were
221.8	before your career break.
223.64	And that's even if your sense of self
223.64	has diminished over time,
227.16	as happens with so many of us
229.28	the farther removed we are
229.28	from our professional identities.
233.2	So for example,
233.2	you might think of yourself
235.92	as someone who looks like this.
237.8	This is me, crazy after a day
237.8	of driving around in my minivan.
242.12	Or here I am in the kitchen.
244.76	But those people from the past,
247.32	they don't know about any of this.
249.56	They only remember you as you were,
252.12	and it's a great confidence boost
252.12	to be back in touch with these people
256.32	and hear their enthusiasm
256.32	about your interest in returning to work.
261.44	There's one more thing I remember vividly
261.44	from my own career break.
265.56	And that was that I hardly kept up
265.56	with the business news.
268.959	My background is in finance,
270.6	and I hardly kept up with any news
273.04	when I was home caring
273.04	for my four young children.
276	So I was afraid I'd go into an interview
279.4	and start talking about a company
279.4	that didn't exist anymore.
283.2	So I had to resubscribe
283.2	to the Wall Street Journal
286.76	and read it for a good six months
286.76	cover to cover before I felt
290.24	like I had a handle on what was going on
290.24	in the business world again.
295.88	I believe relaunchers
295.88	are a gem of the workforce,
299.56	and here's why.
301.32	Think about our life stage:
303.16	for those of us who took career breaks
303.16	for childcare reasons,
306.84	we have fewer or no maternity leaves.
308.84	We did that already.
310.36	We have fewer spousal
310.36	or partner job relocations.
313.72	We're in a more settled time of life.
316.2	We have great work experience.
318.04	We have a more mature perspective.
320.08	We're not trying to find ourselves
320.08	at an employer's expense.
323.68	Plus we have an energy,
323.68	an enthusiasm about returning to work
327.92	precisely because we've been
327.92	away from it for a while.
331.6	On the flip side, I speak with employers,
334.24	and here are two concerns
334.24	that employers have
336.8	about hiring relaunchers.
338.72	The first one is, employers
338.72	are worried that relaunchers
341.8	are technologically obsolete.
344.4	Now, I can tell you,
345.68	having been technologically
345.68	obsolete myself at one point,
349.28	that it's a temporary condition.
351.52	I had done my financial analysis
351.52	so long ago that I used Lotus 1-2-3.
357.68	I don't know if anyone
357.68	can even remember back that far,
360.64	but I had to relearn it on Excel.
362.88	It actually wasn't that hard.
362.88	A lot of the commands are the same.
366.6	I found PowerPoint much more challenging,
368.84	but now I use PowerPoint all the time.
371.96	I tell relaunchers that employers
371.96	expect them to come to the table
376.64	with a working knowledge
376.64	of basic office management software.
380.16	And if they're not up to speed,
381.92	then it's their
381.92	responsibility to get there.
384.32	And they do.
385.96	The second area of concern
385.96	that employers have about relaunchers
389.6	is they're worried that relaunchers
389.6	don't know what they want to do.
393.44	I tell relaunchers that they need
393.44	to do the hard work
396.68	to figure out whether their interests
396.68	and skills have changed
400.2	or have not changed
401.8	while they have been on career break.
403.64	That's not the employer's job.
405.92	It's the relauncher's responsibility
405.92	to demonstrate to the employer
410.52	where they can add the most value.
414.56	Back in 2010 I started noticing something.
418.4	I had been tracking
418.4	return to work programs since 2008,
422.56	and in 2010, I started noticing
425.88	the use of a short-term
425.88	paid work opportunity,
429.8	whether it was called
429.8	an internship or not,
432.28	but an internship-like experience,
434.64	as a way for professionals
434.64	to return to work.
437.8	I saw Goldman Sachs and Sara Lee
440.6	start corporate reentry
440.6	internship programs.
443.92	I saw a returning engineer,
443.92	a nontraditional reentry candidate,
449.12	apply for an entry-level
449.12	internship program in the military,
452.96	and then get a permanent job afterward.
455.88	I saw two universities
455.88	integrate internships
459.6	into mid-career executive
459.6	education programs.
463.2	So I wrote a report
463.2	about what I was seeing,
466.04	and it became this article
466.04	for Harvard Business Review
469.04	"called ""The 40-Year-Old Intern."""
470.96	I have to thank the editors
470.96	there for that title,
473.6	and also for this artwork
475	where you can see the 40-year-old intern
475	in the midst of all the college interns.
479.36	And then, courtesy of Fox Business News,
482.56	they called the concept
482.56	"""The 50-Year-Old Intern."""
485.76	(Laughter)
489.6	So five of the biggest
489.6	financial services companies
493.48	have reentry internship programs
493.48	for returning finance professionals.
497.64	And at this point,
497.64	hundreds of people have participated.
500.96	These internships are paid,
502.76	and the people who move on
502.76	to permanent roles
505.52	are commanding competitive salaries.
508.68	And now, seven of the biggest
508.68	engineering companies
512.16	are piloting reentry internship programs
512.16	for returning engineers
516.48	as part of an initiative
516.48	with the Society of Women Engineers.
521.56	Now, why are companies embracing
521.56	the reentry internship?
526.44	Because the internship allows the employer
529.44	to base their hiring decision
529.44	on an actual work sample
533.48	instead of a series of interviews,
535.559	and the employer does not have to make
535.559	that permanent hiring decision
539.32	until the internship period is over.
542.64	This testing out period
542.64	removes the perceived risk
546.56	that some managers attach
546.56	to hiring relaunchers,
550.16	and they are attracting
550.16	excellent candidates
552.84	who are turning into great hires.
555.24	Think about how far we have come.
557.56	Before this, most employers
557.56	were not interested
560.56	in engaging with relaunchers at all.
562.92	But now, not only
562.92	are programs being developed
566.44	specifically with relaunchers in mind,
569	but you can't even apply
569	for these programs
571.52	unless you have a gap on your résumé.
574.84	This is the mark of real change,
576.96	of true institutional shift,
579.24	because if we can solve
579.24	this problem for relaunchers,
582.8	we can solve it for other
582.8	career transitioners too.
586.12	In fact, an employer just told me
588.08	that their veterans return to work program
590.6	is based on their reentry
590.6	internship program.
594	And there's no reason why there can't be
594	a retiree internship program.
599.04	Different pool, same concept.
602.4	So let me tell you
602.4	what happened with Tracy Shapiro.
604.88	Remember that she had to tell
604.88	everyone she knew
607.48	about her interest in returning to work.
609.8	Well, one critical conversation
609.8	with another parent in her community
614	led to a job offer for Tracy,
616.12	and it was an accounting job
616.12	in a finance department.
618.92	But it was a temp job.
620.8	The company told her
620.8	there was a possibility
623.28	it could turn into something more,
623.28	but no guarantees.
626.84	This was in the fall of 2011.
629.72	Tracy loved this company,
629.72	and she loved the people
632.76	and the office was less
632.76	than 10 minutes from her house.
635.84	So even though she had a second job offer
638.08	at another company
638.08	for a permanent full-time role,
641	she decided to take her chances
641	with this internship
644.24	and hope for the best.
647.32	Well, she ended up blowing away
647.32	all of their expectations,
650.4	and the company not only
650.4	made her a permanent offer
652.92	at the beginning of 2012,
655.04	but they made it even more
655.04	interesting and challenging,
657.68	because they knew what Tracy could handle.
660.4	Fast forward to 2015,
662.88	Tracy's been promoted.
664.48	They've paid for her
664.48	to get her MBA at night.
666.92	She's even hired another relauncher
666.92	to work for her.
671.84	Tracy's temp job was a tryout,
675.24	just like an internship,
676.92	and it ended up being a win
676.92	for both Tracy and her employer.
683.6	Now, my goal is to bring
683.6	the reentry internship concept
688	to more and more employers.
690.76	But in the meantime,
692.6	if you are returning to work
692.6	after a career break,
695.84	don't hesitate to suggest an internship
695.84	or an internship-like arrangement
701.88	to an employer that does not have
701.88	a formal reentry internship program.
707.52	Be their first success story,
709.84	and you can be the example
709.84	for more relaunchers to come.
713.92	Thank you.
715.16	(Applause)
