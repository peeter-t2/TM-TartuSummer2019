15.959	So if you've been following the news,
17.717	you've heard that there's a pack of giant asteroids
20.206	headed for the United States,
21.279	all scheduled to strike within the next 50 years.
24.746	Now I don't mean actual asteroids made of rock and metal.
27.799	That actually wouldn't be such a problem,
29.306	because if we were really all going to die,
31.41	we would put aside our differences, we'd spend whatever it took,
34.448	and we'd find a way to deflect them.
36.578	I'm talking instead about threats that are headed our way,
39.28	but they're wrapped in a special energy field
41.416	that polarizes us, and therefore paralyzes us.
45.766	Last March, I went to the TED conference,
47.67	and I saw Jim Hansen speak, the NASA scientist
50.506	who first raised the alarm about global warming in the 1980s,
53.416	and it seems that the predictions he made back then
55.881	are coming true.
57.722	This is where we're headed in terms of global temperature rises,
61.209	and if we keep on going the way we're going,
62.818	we get a four- or five-degree-Centigrade temperature rise
66.286	by the end of this century.
67.634	Hansen says we can expect about a five-meter rise in sea levels.
71.422	This is what a five-meter rise in sea levels would look like.
74.664	Low-lying cities all around the world will disappear
77.672	within the lifetime of children born today.
81.47	Hansen closed his talk by saying,
83.766	"""Imagine a giant asteroid on a collision course with Earth."
87.903	That is the equivalent of what we face now.
90.256	Yet we dither, taking no action to deflect the asteroid,
94.03	even though the longer we wait,
95.739	"the more difficult and expensive it becomes."""
98.816	Of course, the left wants to take action,
100.623	but the right denies that there's any problem.
103.959	All right, so I go back from TED,
105.537	and then the following week, I'm invited to a dinner party
108.431	in Washington, D.C., where I know that I'll be meeting
110.896	a number of conservative intellectuals, including Yuval Levin,
113.638	and to prepare for the meeting, I read this article by Levin
117.234	"in National Affairs called ""Beyond the Welfare State."""
120.6	Levin writes that all over the world,
123.799	nations are coming to terms with the fact
126.01	that the social democratic welfare state
128.311	is turning out to be untenable and unaffordable,
131.83	dependent upon dubious economics
134.394	and the demographic model of a bygone era.
138.031	All right, now this might not sound as scary as an asteroid,
140.676	but look at these graphs that Levin showed.
143.354	This graph shows the national debt
145.804	as a percentage of America's GDP, and as you see,
148.886	if you go all the way back to the founding,
150.967	we borrowed a lot of money to fight the Revolutionary War.
153.083	Wars are expensive. But then we'd pay it off, pay it off, pay it off,
156.421	and then, oh, what's this? The Civil War. Even more expensive.
159.473	Borrow a lot of money, pay it off, pay it off, pay it off,
162.206	get down to near zero, and bang! -- World War I.
164.928	Once again, the same process repeats.
166.63	Now then we get the Great Depression and World War II.
168.538	We rise to an astronomical level, around 118 percent of GDP,
172.896	really unsustainable, really dangerous.
176.576	But we pay it off, pay it off, pay it off, and then, what's this?
181.203	Why has it been rising since the '70s?
184.212	It's partly due to tax cuts that were unfunded,
187.005	but it's due primarily to the rise of entitlement spending,
189.699	especially Medicare.
191.853	We're approaching the levels of indebtedness we had at World War II,
194.948	and the baby boomers haven't even retired yet,
197.939	and when they do, this is what will happen.
201.209	This is data from the Congressional Budget Office
202.938	showing its most realistic forecast of what would happen
205.765	if current situations and expectations and trends are extended.
209.88	All right, now what you might notice is that these two graphs
212.812	are actually identical, not in terms of the x- and y-axes,
217.443	or in terms of the data they present,
218.638	but in terms of their moral and political implications, they say the same thing.
223.111	Let me translate for you.
224.947	"""We are doomed unless we start acting now."
228.614	What's wrong with you people on the other side in the other party?
231.594	"Can't you see reality? If you won't help, then get the hell out of the way."""
235.983	We can deflect both of these asteroids.
238.264	These problems are both technically solvable.
241.654	Our problem and our tragedy is that in these hyper-partisan times,
244.433	"the mere fact that one side says, ""Look, there's an asteroid,"""
247.425	"means that the other side's going to say, ""Huh? What?"
249.666	"No, I'm not even going to look up. No."""
252.244	To understand why this is happening to us,
255.348	and what we can do about it, we need to learn more about moral psychology.
259.394	So I'm a social psychologist, and I study morality,
262.052	and one of the most important principles of morality
264.439	is that morality binds and blinds.
267.689	It binds us into teams that circle around sacred values
270.123	but thereby makes us go blind to objective reality.
274.036	Think of it like this.
275.142	Large-scale cooperation is extremely rare on this planet.
279.205	There are only a few species that can do it.
281.364	That's a beehive. That's a termite mound, a giant termite mound.
284.364	And when you find this in other animals, it's always the same story.
287.464	They're always all siblings who are children of a single queen,
292.361	so they're all in the same boat.
294.22	They rise or fall, they live or die, as one.
297.541	There's only one species on the planet that can do this
299.832	without kinship, and that, of course, is us.
302.407	This is a reconstruction of ancient Babylon,
304.678	and this is Tenochtitlan.
307.001	Now how did we do this? How did we go
309.093	from being hunter-gatherers 10,000 years ago
312.087	to building these gigantic cities in just a few thousand years?
316.105	It's miraculous, and part of the explanation
319.148	is this ability to circle around sacred values.
323.372	As you see, temples and gods play a big role in all ancient civilizations.
327.296	This is an image of Muslims circling the Kaaba in Mecca.
331.148	It's a sacred rock, and when people circle something together,
334.293	they unite, they can trust each other, they become one.
338.664	It's as though you're moving an electrical wire
340.845	through a magnetic field that generates current.
342.982	When people circle together, they generate a current.
345.905	We love to circle around things.
347.438	We circle around flags, and then we can trust each other.
351.136	We can fight as a team, as a unit.
353.977	But even as morality binds people together into a unit,
357.136	into a team, the circling blinds them.
361.108	It causes them to distort reality.
362.916	We begin separating everything into good versus evil.
366.953	Now that process feels great. It feels really satisfying.
370.851	But it is a gross distortion of reality.
375.07	You can see the moral electromagnet operating in the U.S. Congress.
378.478	This is a graph that shows the degree to which voting
380.71	in Congress falls strictly along the left-right axis,
383.541	so that if you know how liberal or conservative someone is,
386.217	you know exactly how they voted on all the major issues.
389.443	And what you can see is that,
391.497	in the decades after the Civil War,
393.882	Congress was extraordinarily polarized,
396.371	as you would expect, about as high as can be.
398.914	But then, after World War I, things dropped,
401.89	and we get this historically low level of polarization.
404.795	This was a golden age of bipartisanship,
406.487	at least in terms of the parties' ability to work together
409.762	and solve grand national problems.
412.77	But in the 1980s and '90s, the electromagnet turns back on.
417.219	Polarization rises.
420.06	It used to be that conservatives and moderates and liberals
423.026	could all work together in Congress.
424.858	They could rearrange themselves, form bipartisan committees,
427.699	but as the moral electromagnet got cranked up,
430.972	the force field increased,
433.242	Democrats and Republicans were pulled apart.
436.006	It became much harder for them to socialize,
437.993	much harder for them to cooperate.
439.471	Retiring members nowadays say that it's become like gang warfare.
444.312	Did anybody notice that in two of the three debates,
447.824	Obama wore a blue tie and Romney wore a red tie?
451.34	Do you know why they do this?
453.326	It's so that the Bloods and the Crips will know which side to vote for. (Laughter)
457.468	The polarization is strongest among our political elites.
460.234	Nobody doubts that this is happening in Washington.
462.412	But for a while, there was some doubt as to whether it was happening among the people.
465.848	Well, in the last 12 years it's become
467.156	much more apparent that it is.
469.243	So look at this data. This is from the American National Elections Survey.
472.465	And what they do on that survey is they ask
475.105	what's called a feeling thermometer rating.
477.117	So, how warm or cold do you feel about, you know,
481.354	Native Americans, or the military, the Republican Party,
484.129	the Democratic Party, all sorts of groups in American life.
487.055	The blue line shows how warmly Democrats feel
489.737	about Democrats, and they like them.
492.2	You know, ratings in the 70s on a 100-point scale.
494.905	Republicans like Republicans. That's not a surprise.
497.92	But when you look at cross-party ratings,
499.994	you find, well, that it's lower, but actually,
502.529	when I first saw this data, I was surprised.
504.513	That's actually not so bad. If you go back to the Carter and even Reagan administrations,
507.808	they were rating the other party 43, 45. It's not terrible.
512.385	It drifts downwards very slightly,
514.7	but now look what happens under George W. Bush and Obama.
518.561	It plummets. Something is going on here.
521.313	The moral electromagnet is turning back on,
523.714	and nowadays, just very recently,
525.874	Democrats really dislike Republicans.
528.114	Republicans really dislike the Democrats. We're changing.
531.63	It's as though the moral electromagnet is affecting us too.
534.48	It's like put out in the two oceans and it's pulling the whole country apart,
538.205	pulling left and right into their own territories
542.161	like the Bloods and the Crips.
544.97	Now, there are many reasons why this is happening to us,
547.984	and many of them we cannot reverse.
550.904	We will never again have a political class
553.401	that was forged by the experience of fighting together
556.96	in World War II against a common enemy.
559.704	We will never again have just three television networks,
563.238	all of which are relatively centrist.
566.411	And we will never again have a large group of conservative southern Democrats
571.251	and liberal northern Republicans making it easy,
575.042	making there be a lot of overlap for bipartisan cooperation.
579.36	So for a lot of reasons, those decades after the Second World War
582.008	were an historically anomalous time.
583.811	We will never get back to those low levels of polarization, I believe.
587.528	But there's a lot that we can do. There are dozens
590.126	and dozens of reforms we can do that will make things better,
593.272	because a lot of our dysfunction can be traced directly
595.696	to things that Congress did to itself in the 1990s
599.319	that created a much more polarized and dysfunctional institution.
604.414	These changes are detailed in many books.
606.606	These are two that I strongly recommend,
608.846	and they list a whole bunch of reforms.
610.997	I'm just going to group them into three broad classes here.
613.767	So if you think about this as the problem of a dysfunctional,
616.805	hyper-polarized institution, well, the first step is,
620.149	do what you can so that fewer hyper-partisans get elected in the first place,
625.423	and when you have closed party primaries,
626.817	and only the most committed Republicans and Democrats are voting,
629.881	you're nominating and selecting the most extreme hyper-partisans.
633.877	So open primaries would make that problem much, much less severe.
637.464	But the problem isn't primarily that we're electing bad people to Congress.
642.215	From my experience, and from what I've heard from Congressional insiders,
645.615	most of the people going to Congress are good, hard-working,
648.595	intelligent people who really want to solve problems,
651.256	but once they get there, they find that they are forced
653.881	to play a game that rewards hyper-partisanship
656.812	and that punishes independent thinking.
658.461	You step out of line, you get punished.
661.039	So there are a lot of reforms we could do
662.806	that will counteract this.
663.978	"For example, this ""Citizens United"" ruling is a disaster,"
667.198	because it means there's like a money gun aimed at your head,
669.397	and if you step out of line, if you try to reach across the aisle,
672.162	there's a ton of money waiting to be given to your opponent
674.678	to make everybody think that you are a terrible person through negative advertising.
680.343	But the third class of reforms is that we've got to change
682.646	the nature of social relationships in Congress.
685.473	The politicians I've met are generally very extroverted,
689.784	friendly, very socially skillful people,
692.855	and that's the nature of politics. You've got to make relationships,
696.209	make deals, you've got to cajole, please, flatter,
699.488	you've got to use your personal skills,
701.873	and that's the way politics has always worked.
704.264	But beginning in the 1990s, first the House of Representatives
707.344	changed its legislative calendar
709.729	so that all business is basically done in the middle of the week.
713.385	Nowadays, Congressmen fly in on Tuesday morning,
715.614	they do battle for two days, then they fly home Thursday afternoon.
718.463	They don't move their families to the District.
720.368	They don't meet each other's spouses or children.
722.686	There's no more relationship there.
725.2	And trying to run Congress without human relationships
728.996	is like trying to run a car without motor oil.
731.823	Should we be surprised when the whole thing freezes up
734.66	and descends into paralysis and polarization?
738.493	A simple change to the legislative calendar,
740.244	such as having business stretch out for three weeks
742.571	and then they get a week off to go home,
744.134	that would change the fundamental relationships in Congress.
747.459	So there's a lot we can do, but who's going to push them to do it?
750.595	There are a number of groups that are working on this.
752.979	No Labels and Common Cause, I think,
755.131	have very good ideas for changes we need to do
757.27	to make our democracy more responsive and our Congress more effective.
760.435	But I'd like to supplement their work
762.258	with a little psychological trick, and the trick is this.
766.322	Nothing pulls people together like a common threat
769.372	or a common attack, especially an attack from a foreign enemy,
773.165	unless of course that threat hits on our polarized psychology,
778.487	in which case, as I said before, it can actually pull us apart.
781.441	Sometimes a single threat can polarize us, as we saw.
784.364	But what if the situation we face is not a single threat
787.474	but is actually more like this,
789.311	where there's just so much stuff coming in,
790.741	"it's just, ""Start shooting, come on, everybody,"
792.822	"we've got to just work together, just start shooting."""
795.072	Because actually, we do face this situation.
797.697	This is where we are as a country.
800.233	So here's another asteroid.
802.427	We've all seen versions of this graph, right,
804.103	which shows the changes in wealth since 1979,
807.937	and as you can see, almost all the gains in wealth
810.536	have gone to the top 20 percent, and especially the top one percent.
815.43	Rising inequality like this is associated
817.558	with so many problems for a democracy.
820.231	Especially, it destroys our ability to trust each other,
823.199	to feel that we're all in the same boat, because it's obvious we're not.
826.652	Some of us are sitting there safe and sound in gigantic private yachts.
829.61	Other people are clinging to a piece of driftwood.
831.2	We're not all in the same boat, and that means
833.252	nobody's willing to sacrifice for the common good.
838.161	The left has been screaming about this asteroid for 30 years now,
841.037	"and the right says, ""Huh, what? Hmm? No problem. No problem."""
845.979	Now,
848.558	why is that happening to us? Why is the inequality rising?
850.907	Well, one of the largest causes, after globalization,
854.525	is actually this fourth asteroid,
857.371	rising non-marital births.
859.346	This graph shows the steady rise of out-of-wedlock births
862.282	since the 1960s.
864.26	Most Hispanic and black children are now born to unmarried mothers.
867.539	Whites are headed that way too.
869.947	Within a decade or two, most American children
872.292	will be born into homes with no father.
875.161	This means that there's much less money coming into the house.
877.515	But it's not just money. It's also stability versus chaos.
881.473	As I know from working with street children in Brazil,
883.708	Mom's boyfriend is often a really, really dangerous person for kids.
888.77	Now the right has been screaming about this asteroid since the 1960s,
892.787	"and the left has been saying, ""It's not a problem. It's not a problem."""
896.666	The left has been very reluctant to say
898.372	that marriage is actually good for women and for children.
901.977	Now let me be clear. I'm not blaming the women here.
903.938	I'm actually more critical of the men
905.432	who won't take responsibility for their own children
907.425	and of an economic system that makes it difficult
910.256	for many men to earn enough money to support those children.
913.489	But even if you blame nobody, it still is a national problem,
917.857	and one side has been more concerned about it than the other.
921.592	The New York Times finally noticed this asteroid
923.825	with a front-page story last July
926.105	showing how the decline of marriage contributes to inequality.
930.319	We are becoming a nation of just two classes.
933.913	When Americans go to college and marry each other,
936.655	they have very low divorce rates.
939.355	They earn a lot of money, they invest that money in their kids,
942.4	some of them become tiger mothers,
943.943	the kids rise to their full potential,
945.619	and the kids go on to become
948.042	the top two lines in this graph.
952.333	And then there's everybody else:
954.963	the children who don't benefit from a stable marriage,
958.207	who don't have as much invested in them,
959.91	who don't grow up in a stable environment,
961.694	and who go on to become the bottom three lines in that graph.
966.652	So once again, we see that these two graphs are actually saying the same thing.
970.217	As before, we've got a problem, we've got to start working on this,
973.231	we've got to do something,
975.263	and what's wrong with you people that you don't see my threat?
977.903	But if everybody could just take off their partisan blinders,
981.705	we'd see that these two problems actually
984.308	are best addressed together.
987.055	Because if you really care about income inequality,
988.798	you might want to talk to some evangelical Christian groups
991.105	that are working on ways to promote marriage.
994.236	But then you're going to run smack into the problem
996.442	that women don't generally want to marry someone
998.97	who doesn't have a job.
1001.322	So if you really care about strengthening families,
1003.135	you might want to talk to some liberal groups
1004.796	who are working on promoting educational equality,
1008.202	who are working on raising the minimum wage,
1009.962	who are working on finding ways to stop so many men
1012.802	from being sucked into the criminal justice system and
1014.841	taken out of the marriage market for their whole lives.
1018.195	So to conclude, there are at least four asteroids headed our way.
1024.043	How many of you can see all four?
1026.835	Please raise your hand right now if you're willing to admit
1029.45	that all four of these are national problems.
1032.443	Please raise your hands.
1034.3	Okay, almost all of you.
1035.947	Well, congratulations, you guys are the inaugural members
1038.789	of the Asteroids Club, which is a club
1042.052	for all Americans who are willing to admit
1045.293	that the other side actually might have a point.
1048.196	In the Asteroids Club, we don't start by looking for common ground.
1051.227	Common ground is often very hard to find.
1053.121	No, we start by looking for common threats
1055.305	because common threats make common ground.
1058.974	Now, am I being naive? Is it naive to think
1062.798	that people could ever lay down their swords,
1064.169	and left and right could actually work together?
1067.775	I don't think so, because it happens,
1070.262	not all that often, but there are a variety of examples that point the way.
1074.126	This is something we can do.
1075.565	Because Americans on both sides care about the decline in civility,
1079.6	and they've formed dozens of organizations,
1081.351	at the national level, such as this one,
1083.524	down to many local organizations,
1085.172	such as To The Village Square in Tallahassee, Florida,
1087.53	which tries to bring state leaders together to help facilitate
1090.005	that sort of working together human relationship
1093.451	that's necessary to solve Florida's problems.
1096.491	Americans on both sides care about global poverty and AIDS,
1100.886	and on so many humanitarian issues,
1103.782	liberals and evangelicals are actually natural allies,
1106.806	and at times they really have worked together
1108.689	to solve these problems.
1110.606	And most surprisingly to me, they sometimes can even see
1113.329	eye to eye on criminal justice.
1115.325	For example, the incarceration rate, the prison population
1119.278	in this country has quadrupled since 1980.
1123.231	Now this is a social disaster,
1125.815	and liberals are very concerned about this.
1127.867	The Southern Poverty Law Center is often fighting
1130.654	the prison-industrial complex, fighting to prevent a system
1133.526	that's just sucking in more and more poor young men.
1136.304	But are conservatives happy about this?
1138.637	Well, Grover Norquist isn't, because this system
1141.719	costs an unbelievable amount of money.
1144.791	And so, because the prison-industrial complex
1147.37	is bankrupting our states and corroding our souls,
1151.607	groups of fiscal conservatives and Christian conservatives
1155.339	have come together to form a group called Right on Crime.
1159.171	And at times they have worked with the Southern Poverty Law Center
1161.827	to oppose the building of new prisons
1163.805	and to work for reforms that will make the justice system
1167.146	more efficient and more humane.
1170.267	So this is possible. We can do it.
1173.562	Let us therefore go to battle stations,
1176.643	not to fight each other,
1177.902	but to begin deflecting these incoming asteroids.
1181.228	And let our first mission be to press Congress
1184.299	to reform itself, before it's too late for our nation.
1188.242	Thank you. (Applause)
