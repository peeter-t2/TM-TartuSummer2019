16.046	If I should have a daughter,
18.728	"instead of ""Mom,"""
20.863	"she's going to call me ""Point B,"""
24.188	because that way she knows
24.188	that no matter what happens,
26.839	at least she can always find
26.839	her way to me.
29.783	And I'm going to paint solar systems
29.783	on the backs of her hands
33.204	so she has to learn the entire universe
35.166	"before she can say, ""Oh, I know that"
35.166	"like the back of my hand."""
38.617	And she's going to learn
40.26	that this life will hit you
40.26	hard in the face,
43.26	wait for you to get back up just
43.26	so it can kick you in the stomach.
46.579	But getting the wind knocked out of you
48.515	is the only way to remind your lungs
50.385	how much they like the taste of air.
53.011	There is hurt, here,
54.56	that cannot be fixed
54.56	by Band-Aids or poetry.
56.924	So the first time she realizes
56.924	that Wonder Woman isn't coming,
60.26	I'll make sure she knows
61.798	she doesn't have to wear
61.798	the cape all by herself,
64.221	because no matter how wide
64.221	you stretch your fingers,
66.735	your hands will always be too small
68.434	to catch all the pain you want to heal.
70.975	Believe me, I've tried.
72.978	"""And, baby,"" I'll tell her,"
74.297	don't keep your nose up
74.297	in the air like that.
76.439	I know that trick;
76.439	I've done it a million times.
78.737	You're just smelling for smoke
80.26	so you can follow the trail
80.26	back to a burning house,
83.26	so you can find the boy
83.26	who lost everything in the fire
85.903	to see if you can save him.
87.833	Or else find the boy who lit
87.833	the fire in the first place,
91.26	to see if you can change him.
93.761	But I know she will anyway,
95.26	so instead I'll always keep
95.26	an extra supply
97.332	of chocolate and rain boots nearby,
99.474	because there is no heartbreak
99.474	that chocolate can't fix.
103.418	Okay, there's a few
103.418	that chocolate can't fix.
105.585	But that's what the rain boots are for,
107.847	because rain will wash away
107.847	everything, if you let it.
111.26	I want her to look at the world
113.26	through the underside
113.26	of a glass-bottom boat,
115.866	to look through a microscope
117.26	at the galaxies that exist
119.26	on the pinpoint of a human mind,
121.459	because that's the way my mom taught me.
123.491	That there'll be days like this.
125.26	(Singing) There'll be days
125.26	like this, my momma said.
128.26	When you open your hands to catch
130.26	and wind up with only
130.26	blisters and bruises;
132.831	when you step out of the phone
132.831	booth and try to fly
135.26	and the very people you want to save
137.161	are the ones standing on your cape;
138.924	when your boots will fill with rain,
140.852	and you'll be up to your knees
140.852	in disappointment.
143.26	And those are the very days you have
143.26	all the more reason to say thank you.
146.786	Because there's nothing more beautiful
148.665	than the way the ocean refuses
148.665	to stop kissing the shoreline,
151.55	no matter how many times it's sent away.
153.816	You will put the wind
153.816	in win some, lose some.
157.871	You will put the star
157.871	in starting over, and over.
161.26	And no matter how many land
161.26	mines erupt in a minute,
164.26	be sure your mind lands
165.91	on the beauty of this
165.91	funny place called life.
168.291	And yes, on a scale
168.291	from one to over-trusting,
171.077	I am pretty damn naive.
173.26	But I want her to know
173.26	that this world is made out of sugar.
176.783	It can crumble so easily,
178.26	but don't be afraid to stick
178.26	your tongue out and taste it.
181.26	"""Baby,"" I'll tell her, ""remember,"
181.26	your momma is a worrier,
184.26	and your poppa is a warrior,
186.118	and you are the girl
186.118	with small hands and big eyes
188.504	"who never stops asking for more."""
190.26	Remember that good things come in threes
192.863	and so do bad things.
194.768	Always apologize when
194.768	you've done something wrong,
197.672	but don't you ever apologize
199.077	for the way your eyes
199.077	refuse to stop shining.
201.26	Your voice is small,
201.26	but don't ever stop singing.
204.26	And when they finally hand you heartache,
206.26	when they slip war
206.26	and hatred under your door
209.26	and offer you handouts on street-corners
211.26	of cynicism and defeat,
213.26	you tell them that they really
213.26	ought to meet your mother.
218.83	(Applause)
219.855	Thank you. Thank you.
223.26	(Applause)
226.609	Thank you.
227.997	(Applause)
230.26	Thanks.
232.293	(Applause)
235.553	Thank you.
236.76	(Applause)
240.26	All right, so I want you to take a moment,
243.26	and I want you to think of three things
243.26	that you know to be true.
247.26	They can be about whatever you want --
249.26	technology, entertainment, design,
251.842	your family, what you had for breakfast.
253.795	The only rule is don't think too hard.
256.541	Okay, ready? Go.
264.982	Okay.
266.387	So here are three things
266.387	I know to be true.
268.618	I know that Jean-Luc Godard
268.618	was right when he said that,
271.673	"""A good story has a beginning,"
271.673	a middle and an end,
274.721	"although not necessarily in that order."""
277.032	I know that I'm incredibly nervous
277.032	and excited to be up here,
280.26	which is greatly inhibiting
280.26	my ability to keep it cool.
283.285	(Laughter)
284.642	And I know
286.26	that I have been waiting
286.26	all week to tell this joke.
289.596	(Laughter)
291.176	Why was the scarecrow invited to TED?
294.128	Because he was out standing in his field.
297.025	(Laughter)
299.803	I'm sorry.
302.525	Okay, so these are three things
302.525	I know to be true.
305.685	But there are plenty of things
305.685	I have trouble understanding.
308.892	So I write poems to figure things out.
312.26	Sometimes the only way I know
312.26	how to work through something
315.094	is by writing a poem.
316.571	Sometimes I get to the end of the poem,
318.493	look back and go,
318.493	"""Oh, that's what this is all about,"""
321.044	and sometimes I get to the end of the poem
323.085	and haven't solved anything,
324.444	but at least I have a new poem out of it.
326.642	Spoken-word poetry is the art
326.642	of performance poetry.
329.365	I tell people it involves creating poetry
331.836	that doesn't just want to sit on paper,
333.748	that something about it
333.748	demands it be heard out loud
336.581	or witnessed in person.
338.509	When I was a freshman in high school,
340.438	I was a live wire of nervous hormones.
344.802	And I was underdeveloped
344.802	and over-excitable.
348.26	And despite my fear
350.26	of ever being looked at for too long,
352.45	I was fascinated by the idea
352.45	of spoken-word poetry.
355.695	I felt that my two secret loves,
355.695	poetry and theater,
359.359	had come together, had a baby,
362.312	a baby I needed to get to know.
364.001	So I decided to give it a try.
365.97	My first spoken-word poem,
367.898	packed with all the wisdom
367.898	of a 14-year-old,
371.26	was about the injustice
373.26	of being seen as unfeminine.
375.286	The poem was very indignant,
378.144	and mainly exaggerated,
379.31	but the only spoken-word poetry
379.31	that I had seen up until that point
382.562	was mainly indignant,
384.26	so I thought
384.26	that's what was expected of me.
386.618	The first time that I performed,
388.26	the audience of teenagers hooted
388.26	and hollered their sympathy,
391.773	and when I came off the stage,
391.773	I was shaking.
394.26	I felt this tap on my shoulder,
396.171	and I turned around to see
397.751	this giant girl in a hoodie
397.751	sweatshirt emerge from the crowd.
400.686	She was maybe eight feet tall
402.125	and looked like she could
402.125	beat me up with one hand,
404.607	but instead she just nodded
404.607	at me and said,
407.79	"""Hey, I really felt that. Thanks."""
410.774	And lightning struck.
412.234	I was hooked.
413.731	I discovered this bar
413.731	on Manhattan's Lower East Side
417.023	that hosted a weekly poetry open Mic,
419.26	and my bewildered,
419.26	but supportive, parents took me
422.26	to soak in every ounce
422.26	of spoken word that I could.
425.26	I was the youngest by at least a decade,
428.26	but somehow the poets
428.26	at the Bowery Poetry Club
431.26	didn't seem bothered
431.26	by the 14-year-old wandering about.
434.505	In fact, they welcomed me.
436.054	And it was here, listening to these poets
436.054	share their stories,
439.015	that I learned that spoken-word
439.015	poetry didn't have to be indignant,
442.222	it could be fun or painful
444.566	or serious or silly.
446.526	The Bowery Poetry Club became
446.526	my classroom and my home,
449.804	and the poets who performed
451.464	encouraged me to share my stories as well.
453.868	Never mind the fact that I was 14.
455.781	"They told me, ""Write about being 14."""
458.9	So I did and stood amazed every week
461.003	when these brilliant, grown-up poets
463.26	laughed with me and groaned their sympathy
465.285	and clapped and told me,
465.285	"""Hey, I really felt that too."""
469.421	Now I can divide my spoken-word journey
472.687	into three steps.
474.26	Step one was the moment I said,
476.101	"""I can. I can do this."""
478.26	And that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie.
480.471	Step two was the moment I said,
482.55	"""I will. I will continue."
484.742	I love spoken word. I will keep
484.742	"coming back week after week."""
487.646	And step three began
489.26	when I realized I didn't have
489.26	to write indignant poems,
492.084	if that's not what I was.
493.506	There were things
493.506	that were specific to me,
495.695	and the more that I focused
495.695	on those things,
498.26	the weirder my poetry got,
500.26	but the more that it felt like mine.
502.26	It's not just the adage
502.26	"""Write what you know."""
505.982	It's about gathering up
505.982	all of the knowledge and experience
508.831	you've collected up to now
510.466	to help you dive into the things
510.466	you don't know.
513.229	I use poetry to help me work
513.229	through what I don't understand,
516.136	but I show up to each new poem
518.105	with a backpack full
518.105	of everywhere else that I've been.
521.726	When I got to university,
521.726	I met a fellow poet
524.475	who shared my belief in the magic
524.475	of spoken-word poetry.
527.991	And actually, Phil Kaye and I
530.009	coincidentally also share
530.009	the same last name.
532.626	When I was in high school I had
532.626	created Project V.O.I.C.E.
535.385	as a way to encourage my friends
535.385	to do spoken word with me.
538.26	But Phil and I decided to reinvent
538.26	Project V.O.I.C.E.,
541.26	this time changing the mission
543.26	to using spoken-word poetry
543.26	as a way to entertain,
546.26	educate and inspire.
548.26	We stayed full-time students,
548.26	but in between we traveled,
550.999	performing and teaching
552.851	nine-year-olds to MFA candidates,
555.259	from California to Indiana to India
558.629	to a public high school
558.629	just up the street from campus.
561.26	And we saw over and over
563.261	the way that spoken-word poetry
565.26	cracks open locks.
567.361	But it turns out sometimes,
567.361	poetry can be really scary.
572.083	Turns out sometimes,
573.599	you have to trick teenagers
573.599	into writing poetry.
576.26	So I came up with lists.
576.26	Everyone can write lists.
579.749	And the first list that I assign
581.799	"is ""10 Things I Know to be True."""
585.082	And here's what happens,
585.082	you would discover it too
587.462	if we all started sharing
587.462	our lists out loud.
589.605	At a certain point, you would realize
589.605	that someone has the exact same thing,
594.959	or one thing very similar,
596.96	to something on your list.
598.26	And then someone else
600.26	has something the complete
600.26	opposite of yours.
603.26	Third, someone has something
603.26	you've never even heard of before.
606.284	Fourth, someone has something
606.284	you thought you knew everything about,
609.753	but they're introducing
609.753	a new angle of looking at it.
612.26	And I tell people that this is
612.26	where great stories start from --
615.332	these four intersections
617.484	of what you're passionate about
619.26	and what others might be invested in.
621.667	And most people respond
621.667	really well to this exercise.
624.936	But one of my students,
624.936	a freshman named Charlotte,
627.405	was not convinced.
629.301	Charlotte was very good at writing lists,
629.301	but she refused to write any poems.
632.951	"""Miss,"" she'd say,"
632.951	"""I'm just not interesting."
635.263	"I don't have anything interesting to say."""
638.371	So I assigned her list after list,
640.26	and one day I assigned the list
641.935	"""10 Things I Should Have Learned by Now."""
644.553	Number three on Charlotte's list was,
646.487	"""I should have learned"
646.487	not to crush on guys
648.528	"three times my age."""
650.955	I asked her what that meant,
652.352	"and she said, ""Miss,"
652.352	"it's kind of a long story."""
654.814	"And I said, ""Charlotte, it sounds"
654.814	"pretty interesting to me."""
657.662	And so she wrote her first poem,
659.44	a love poem unlike any
659.44	I had ever heard before.
663.041	And the poem began,
665.486	"""Anderson Cooper is a gorgeous man."""
667.628	(Laughter)
670.121	"""Did you see him on 60 Minutes,"
671.762	racing Michael Phelps in a pool --
673.566	nothing but swim trunks on --
675.26	diving in the water, determined
675.26	to beat this swimming champion?
678.416	After the race, he tossed
678.416	his wet, cloud-white hair
680.829	and said, 'You're a god.'
682.112	"No, Anderson, you're the god."""
684.26	(Laughter)
686.26	(Applause)
690.26	Now, I know that the number one
690.26	rule to being cool
694.076	is to seem unfazed,
695.987	to never admit that anything scares you
699.207	or impresses you or excites you.
700.84	Somebody once told me
702.26	it's like walking through life like this.
704.433	You protect yourself
705.831	from all the unexpected miseries
705.831	or hurt that might show up.
709.093	But I try to walk through life like this.
711.747	And yes, that means catching
711.747	all of those miseries and hurt,
714.638	but it also means
714.638	that when beautiful, amazing things
718.388	just fall out of the sky,
719.829	I'm ready to catch them.
721.26	I use spoken word to help my students
723.665	rediscover wonder,
725.26	to fight their instincts
725.26	to be cool and unfazed
728.05	and, instead, actively pursue being
728.05	engaged with what goes on around them,
731.589	so that they can reinterpret
731.589	and create something from it.
734.906	It's not that I think
734.906	that spoken-word poetry
737.223	is the ideal art form.
738.723	I'm always trying to find
738.723	the best way to tell each story.
741.882	I write musicals; I make short films
741.882	alongside my poems.
744.931	But I teach spoken-word poetry
747.129	because it's accessible.
749.098	Not everyone can read music
749.098	or owns a camera,
752.57	but everyone can communicate in some way,
754.959	and everyone has stories
754.959	that the rest of us can learn from.
758.76	Plus, spoken-word poetry allows
758.76	for immediate connection.
762.016	It's not uncommon
762.016	to feel like you're alone
764.235	or that nobody understands you,
765.852	but spoken word teaches
767.26	that if you have the ability
767.26	to express yourself
770.015	and the courage to present
770.015	those stories and opinions,
772.856	you could be rewarded
774.26	with a room full of your peers,
776.26	or your community, who will listen.
778.57	And maybe even a giant girl in a hoodie
780.889	who will connect with what you've shared.
782.959	And that is an amazing
782.959	realization to have,
785.26	especially when you're 14.
787.726	Plus, now with YouTube,
789.26	that connection's not even limited
789.26	to the room we're in.
791.926	I'm so lucky that there's
791.926	this archive of performances
795.172	that I can share with my students.
796.86	It allows for even more opportunities
799.329	for them to find a poet or a poem
799.329	that they connect to.
803.127	Once you've figured this out,
805.618	it is tempting to keep
805.618	writing the same poem,
807.785	or keep telling the same story,
807.785	over and over,
809.992	once you've figured out
809.992	that it will gain you applause.
812.595	It's not enough to just teach
812.595	that you can express yourself.
815.602	You have to grow and explore
817.26	and take risks and challenge yourself.
819.581	And that is step three:
822.26	infusing the work you're doing
824.26	with the specific things
824.26	that make you you,
826.332	even while those things
826.332	are always changing.
828.969	Because step three never ends.
831.809	But you don't get to start on step three,
833.837	until you take step one first:
836.025	"""I can."""
837.062	I travel a lot while I'm teaching,
838.808	and I don't always get to watch
838.808	all of my students reach their step three,
842.334	but I was very lucky with Charlotte,
844.076	that I got to watch her journey
844.076	unfold the way it did.
846.74	I watched her realize
848.096	that, by putting the things that she knows
848.096	to be true into the work she's doing,
851.896	she can create poems
851.896	that only Charlotte can write,
854.36	about eyeballs and elevators
854.36	and Dora the Explorer.
857.672	And I'm trying to tell
857.672	stories only I can tell --
860.037	like this story.
861.26	I spent a lot of time thinking
861.26	about the best way to tell this story,
864.548	and I wondered if the best way
866.014	was going to be
866.014	a PowerPoint, a short film --
868.141	And where exactly was the beginning,
868.141	the middle or the end?
870.942	I wondered whether I'd get
870.942	to the end of this talk
873.339	and finally have
873.339	figured it all out, or not.
876.568	And I always thought that my beginning
876.568	was at the Bowery Poetry Club,
879.856	but it's possible
879.856	that it was much earlier.
881.956	In preparing for TED,
883.26	I discovered this diary page
883.26	in an old journal.
885.523	I think December 54th
885.523	was probably supposed to be 24th.
889.26	It's clear that when I was a child,
891.26	I definitely walked
891.26	through life like this.
893.537	I think that we all did.
895.323	I would like to help others
895.323	rediscover that wonder --
898.26	to want to engage with it,
898.26	to want to learn,
900.749	to want to share what they've learned,
902.66	what they've figured out to be true
904.36	and what they're still figuring out.
906.36	So I'd like to close with this poem.
910.066	When they bombed Hiroshima,
912.671	the explosion formed a mini-supernova,
915.75	so every living animal, human or plant
918.828	that received direct contact
918.828	with the rays from that sun
922.53	was instantly turned to ash.
924.412	And what was left
924.412	of the city soon followed.
926.525	The long-lasting damage
926.525	of nuclear radiation
928.953	caused an entire city and its population
931.894	to turn into powder.
934.406	When I was born, my mom says
934.406	I looked around the whole hospital room
938.043	with a stare that said,
938.043	"""This? I've done this before."""
941.684	She says I have old eyes.
943.6	When my Grandpa Genji died,
943.6	I was only five years old,
946.26	but I took my mom
946.26	by the hand and told her,
948.433	"""Don't worry, he'll come back as a baby."""
951.544	And yet, for someone
951.544	who's apparently done this already,
954.732	I still haven't figured anything out yet.
957.26	My knees still buckle
957.26	every time I get on a stage.
960.26	My self-confidence can be measured out
962.26	in teaspoons mixed into my poetry,
964.26	and it still always
964.26	tastes funny in my mouth.
967.562	But in Hiroshima, some people
967.562	were wiped clean away,
970.807	leaving only a wristwatch or a diary page.
973.585	So no matter that I have inhibitions
973.585	to fill all my pockets,
977.041	I keep trying,
978.26	hoping that one day I'll write a poem
980.26	I can be proud to let sit
980.26	in a museum exhibit
982.427	as the only proof I existed.
985.115	My parents named me Sarah,
985.115	which is a biblical name.
988.26	In the original story, God told Sarah
988.26	she could do something impossible, and --
993.085	she laughed,
994.363	because the first Sarah,
995.964	she didn't know what to do
995.964	with impossible.
998.332	And me?
999.716	Well, neither do I,
1001.26	but I see the impossible every day.
1003.26	Impossible is trying
1003.26	to connect in this world,
1006.189	trying to hold onto others while things
1006.189	are blowing up around you,
1009.317	knowing that while you're speaking,
1011.017	they aren't just waiting for their turn
1011.017	to talk -- they hear you.
1014.099	They feel exactly what you feel
1015.614	at the same time that you feel it.
1017.26	It's what I strive for every time
1017.26	I open my mouth --
1019.761	that impossible connection.
1021.865	There's this piece of wall in Hiroshima
1024.26	that was completely burnt
1024.26	black by the radiation.
1027.026	But on the front step,
1027.026	a person who was sitting there
1029.724	blocked the rays from hitting the stone.
1032.018	The only thing left now
1033.26	is a permanent shadow of positive light.
1036.185	After the A-bomb,
1037.26	specialists said it would take 75 years
1039.872	for the radiation-damaged
1039.872	soil of Hiroshima City
1042.26	to ever grow anything again.
1044.26	But that spring, there were
1044.26	new buds popping up from the earth.
1047.649	When I meet you, in that moment,
1049.676	I'm no longer a part of your future.
1051.536	I start quickly becoming
1051.536	part of your past.
1053.799	But in that instant,
1053.799	I get to share your present.
1056.26	And you, you get to share mine.
1058.26	And that is the greatest present of all.
1060.26	So if you tell me
1060.26	I can do the impossible --
1063.154	I'll probably laugh at you.
1064.672	I don't know if I can change
1064.672	the world yet,
1066.784	because I don't know that much about it --
1068.827	and I don't know that much
1068.827	about reincarnation either,
1071.441	but if you make me laugh hard enough,
1073.309	sometimes I forget what century I'm in.
1075.561	This isn't my first time here.
1075.561	This isn't my last time here.
1079.044	These aren't the last words I'll share.
1080.98	But just in case, I'm trying my hardest
1083.26	to get it right this time around.
1086.156	Thank you.
1087.283	(Applause)
1089.137	Thank you.
1090.193	(Applause)
1093.45	Thank you.
1094.621	(Applause)
1097.482	Thank you.
1098.626	(Applause)
