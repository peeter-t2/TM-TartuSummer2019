12.902	When people find out
12.902	I write about time management,
16.588	they assume two things.
19.564	One is that I'm always on time,
23.747	and I'm not.
25.525	I have four small children,
26.894	and I would like to blame them
26.894	for my occasional tardiness,
29.734	but sometimes it's just not their fault.
32.365	I was once late to my own speech
32.365	on time management.
35.136	(Laughter)
36.2	We all had to just take a moment
36.2	together and savor that irony.
40.972	The second thing they assume
40.972	is that I have lots of tips and tricks
44.215	for saving bits of time here and there.
46.132	Sometimes I'll hear from magazines
46.132	that are doing a story along these lines,
49.87	generally on how to help their readers
49.87	find an extra hour in the day.
53.221	And the idea is that we'll shave
53.221	bits of time off everyday activities,
56.531	add it up,
57.732	and we'll have time for the good stuff.
59.93	I question the entire premise
59.93	of this piece, but I'm always interested
63.988	in hearing what they've come
63.988	up with before they call me.
66.695	Some of my favorites:
67.871	doing errands where you only
67.871	have to make right-hand turns --
70.801	(Laughter)
71.853	Being extremely judicious
71.853	in microwave usage:
74.023	it says three to three-and-a-half
74.023	minutes on the package,
76.77	we're totally getting in on
76.77	the bottom side of that.
79.23	And my personal favorite,
79.23	which makes sense on some level,
81.993	is to DVR your favorite shows so you can
81.993	fast-forward through the commercials.
85.769	That way, you save
85.769	eight minutes every half hour,
88.085	so in the course of two hours
88.085	of watching TV,
90.206	you find 32 minutes to exercise.
91.773	(Laughter)
92.813	Which is true.
94.587	You know another way to find
97.629	Don't watch two hours of TV a day, right?
99.985	(Laughter)
101.025	Anyway, the idea is we'll save bits
101.025	of time here and there, add it up,
104.523	we will finally get
104.523	to everything we want to do.
106.831	But after studying how successful
106.831	people spend their time
109.767	and looking at their
109.767	schedules hour by hour,
112.428	I think this idea
112.428	has it completely backward.
116.305	We don't build the lives
116.305	we want by saving time.
120.566	We build the lives we want,
122.636	and then time saves itself.
127.194	Here's what I mean.
128.369	I recently did a time diary project
130.087	looking at 1,001 days in the lives
130.087	of extremely busy women.
134.315	They had demanding jobs,
134.315	sometimes their own businesses,
136.983	kids to care for,
136.983	maybe parents to care for,
139.142	community commitments --
140.496	busy, busy people.
142.799	I had them keep track
142.799	of their time for a week
145.03	so I could add up how much
145.03	they worked and slept,
147.367	and I interviewed them
147.367	about their strategies, for my book.
150.2	One of the women whose time log I studied
152.213	goes out on a Wednesday night
152.213	for something.
154.3	She comes home to find
154.3	that her water heater has broken,
156.953	and there is now water
156.953	all over her basement.
160.38	If you've ever had anything
160.38	like this happen to you,
162.858	you know it is a hugely damaging,
162.858	frightening, sopping mess.
165.762	So she's dealing with the immediate
165.762	aftermath that night,
168.496	next day she's got plumbers coming in,
170.397	day after that, professional cleaning
170.397	crew dealing with the ruined carpet.
173.921	All this is being recorded
173.921	on her time log.
176.011	Winds up taking seven hours of her week.
179.191	Seven hours.
181.179	That's like finding
181.179	an extra hour in the day.
184.834	But I'm sure if you had asked her
184.834	at the start of the week,
187.652	"""Could you find seven hours"
187.652	"to train for a triathlon?"""
191.893	"""Could you find seven hours"
191.893	"to mentor seven worthy people?"""
195.722	I'm sure she would've said
195.722	what most of us would've said,
198.437	"which is, ""No -- can't you see"
198.437	"how busy I am?"""
203.521	Yet when she had to find seven hours
205.342	because there is water
205.342	all over her basement,
208.165	she found seven hours.
211.055	And what this shows us
211.055	is that time is highly elastic.
215.594	We cannot make more time,
217.661	but time will stretch to accommodate
217.661	what we choose to put into it.
222.366	And so the key to time management
225.541	is treating our priorities
227.8	as the equivalent
227.8	of that broken water heater.
232.162	To get at this,
233.336	I like to use language from one
233.336	of the busiest people I ever interviewed.
236.805	By busy, I mean she was running
236.805	a small business
239.117	with 12 people on the payroll,
240.61	she had six children in her spare time.
242.657	I was getting in touch with her
242.657	to set up an interview
245.299	"on how she ""had it all"" -- that phrase."
247.819	I remember it was a Thursday morning,
249.652	and she was not available
249.652	to speak with me.
251.683	Of course, right?
252.863	But the reason she was
252.863	unavailable to speak with me
255.306	is that she was out for a hike,
257.27	because it was a beautiful spring morning,
259.332	and she wanted to go for a hike.
260.919	So of course this makes me
260.919	even more intrigued,
263.28	and when I finally do catch up with her,
263.28	she explains it like this.
266.48	"She says, ""Listen Laura, everything I do,"
269.592	"every minute I spend, is my choice."""
273.83	And rather than say,
275.005	"""I don't have time to do x, y or z,"""
277.893	"she'd say, ""I don't do x, y or z"
277.893	"because it's not a priority."""
283.709	"""I don't have time,"" often means"
283.709	"""It's not a priority."""
289.075	If you think about it,
289.075	that's really more accurate language.
291.987	I could tell you I don't have time
291.987	to dust my blinds,
294.575	but that's not true.
295.768	If you offered to pay me $100,000
295.768	to dust my blinds,
298.232	I would get to it pretty quickly.
299.856	(Laughter)
300.896	Since that is not going to happen,
302.555	I can acknowledge this is not
302.555	a matter of lacking time;
305.183	it's that I don't want to do it.
306.808	Using this language reminds us
306.808	that time is a choice.
310.218	And granted,
311.415	there may be horrible consequences
311.415	for making different choices,
314.471	I will give you that.
315.701	But we are smart people,
317.347	and certainly over the long run,
319.229	we have the power to fill our lives
321.253	with the things that deserve to be there.
325.204	So how do we do that?
327.127	How do we treat our priorities
328.583	as the equivalent
328.583	of that broken water heater?
331.531	Well, first we need
331.531	to figure out what they are.
333.874	I want to give you two strategies
333.874	for thinking about this.
336.652	The first, on the professional side:
338.434	I'm sure many people
338.434	coming up to the end of the year
340.969	are giving or getting
340.969	annual performance reviews.
343.316	You look back over
343.316	your successes over the year,
345.605	"your ""opportunities for growth."""
347.674	And this serves its purpose,
350.221	but I find it's more effective
350.221	to do this looking forward.
353.175	So I want you to pretend
353.175	it's the end of next year.
356.326	You're giving yourself
356.326	a performance review,
358.711	and it has been an absolutely
358.711	amazing year for you professionally.
364.034	What three to five things did you do
364.034	that made it so amazing?
370.734	So you can write next
370.734	year's performance review now.
374.558	And you can do this
374.558	for your personal life, too.
376.829	I'm sure many of you,
376.829	like me, come December,
379.482	get cards that contain these folded up
379.482	sheets of colored paper,
383.491	on which is written what is known
383.491	as the family holiday letter.
388.345	(Laughter)
390.007	Bit of a wretched genre
390.007	of literature, really,
392.662	going on about how amazing
392.662	everyone in the household is,
395.97	or even more scintillating,
397.281	how busy everyone in the household is.
399.815	But these letters serve a purpose,
401.488	which is that they tell
401.488	your friends and family
403.719	what you did in your personal life
403.719	that mattered to you over the year.
407.068	So this year's kind of done,
408.476	but I want you to pretend
408.476	it's the end of next year,
410.95	and it has been an absolutely amazing year
414.172	for you and the people you care about.
417.391	What three to five things did you do
417.391	that made it so amazing?
422.839	So you can write next
422.839	year's family holiday letter now.
427.789	Don't send it.
429.006	(Laughter)
430.046	Please, don't send it.
433.049	But you can write it.
434.463	And now, between the performance
434.463	review and the family holiday letter,
438.201	we have a list of six to ten goals
438.201	we can work on in the next year.
441.462	And now we need to break
441.462	these down into doable steps.
444.285	So maybe you want
444.285	to write a family history.
446.517	First, you can read
446.517	some other family histories,
448.794	get a sense for the style.
450.08	Then maybe think about the questions
450.08	you want to ask your relatives,
453.311	set up appointments to interview them.
455.184	Or maybe you want to run a 5K.
456.669	So you need to find a race and sign up,
456.669	figure out a training plan,
459.854	and dig those shoes
459.854	out of the back of the closet.
462.251	And then -- this is key --
464.217	we treat our priorities as the equivalent
464.217	of that broken water heater,
468.336	by putting them into our schedules first.
471.879	We do this by thinking through our weeks
471.879	before we are in them.
476.663	I find a really good time to do this
476.663	is Friday afternoons.
480.885	Friday afternoon is what
480.885	an economist might call
483.457	"a ""low opportunity cost"" time."
486.764	Most of us are not sitting there
486.764	on Friday afternoons saying,
489.688	"""I am excited to make progress"
491.591	toward my personal
491.591	and professional priorities
493.911	"right now."""
495.089	(Laughter)
496.129	But we are willing to think
496.129	about what those should be.
498.77	So take a little bit
498.77	of time Friday afternoon,
500.999	make yourself a three-category priority
500.999	list: career, relationships, self.
508.382	Making a three-category list reminds us
511.604	that there should be something
511.604	in all three categories.
515.118	Career, we think about;
516.398	relationships, self --
517.929	not so much.
519.272	But anyway, just a short list,
521.194	two to three items in each.
523.013	Then look out over the whole
523.013	of the next week,
525.418	and see where you can plan them in.
528.171	Where you plan them in is up to you.
530.205	I know this is going to be more
530.205	complicated for some people than others.
533.691	I mean, some people's lives
533.691	are just harder than others.
537.674	It is not going to be easy
537.674	to find time to take that poetry class
540.967	if you are caring for multiple
540.967	children on your own.
544.058	I get that.
545.253	And I don't want to minimize
545.253	anyone's struggle.
547.484	But I do think that the numbers
547.484	I am about to tell you are empowering.
552.906	There are 168 hours in a week.
557.962	Twenty-four times seven is 168 hours.
563.295	That is a lot of time.
566.627	If you are working a full-time
566.627	job, so 40 hours a week,
569.842	sleeping eight hours a night,
569.842	so 56 hours a week --
572.958	that leaves 72 hours for other things.
576.622	That is a lot of time.
578.956	You say you're working 50 hours a week,
580.865	maybe a main job and a side hustle.
582.835	Well, that leaves 62 hours
582.835	for other things.
585.329	You say you're working 60 hours.
587.253	Well, that leaves 52 hours
587.253	for other things.
589.705	You say you're working more than 60 hours.
591.771	Well, are you sure?
593.352	(Laughter)
595.11	There was once a study comparing
595.11	people's estimated work weeks
598.04	with time diaries.
599.459	They found that people claiming
602.159	were off by about 25 hours.
604.287	(Laughter)
606.005	You can guess in which direction, right?
609.567	Anyway, in 168 hours a week,
611.804	I think we can find time
611.804	for what matters to you.
614.792	If you want to spend
614.792	more time with your kids,
617.014	you want to study more
617.014	for a test you're taking,
619.343	you want to exercise for three hours
619.343	and volunteer for two,
622.712	you can.
623.89	And that's even if you're working
623.89	way more than full-time hours.
627.885	So we have plenty of time, which is great,
629.961	because guess what?
631.211	We don't even need that much
631.211	time to do amazing things.
634.486	But when most of us have
634.486	bits of time, what do we do?
637.708	Pull out the phone, right?
639.826	Start deleting emails.
642.381	Otherwise, we're puttering
642.381	around the house
644.492	or watching TV.
646.114	But small moments can have great power.
649.657	You can use your bits of time
652.094	for bits of joy.
655.195	Maybe it's choosing to read
655.195	something wonderful on the bus
658.088	on the way to work.
659.476	I know when I had a job
659.476	that required two bus rides
661.899	and a subway ride every morning,
663.468	I used to go to the library
663.468	on weekends to get stuff to read.
666.395	It made the whole experience
666.395	almost, almost, enjoyable.
671.857	Breaks at work can be used
671.857	for meditating or praying.
675.434	If family dinner is out
675.434	because of your crazy work schedule,
678.652	maybe family breakfast
678.652	could be a good substitute.
681.89	It's about looking at
681.89	the whole of one's time
685.044	and seeing where the good stuff can go.
688.504	I truly believe this.
691.054	There is time.
694.981	Even if we are busy,
697.223	we have time for what matters.
699.752	And when we focus on what matters,
702.312	we can build the lives we want
704.765	in the time we've got.
706.638	Thank you.
707.817	(Applause)
