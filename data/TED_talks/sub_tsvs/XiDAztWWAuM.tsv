15.825	I'm an Iranian-American Muslim female,
18.167	like all of you.
19.455	And I'm also a social justice comedian,
21.788	something that I insist is an actual job.
24.127	To explain what that is,
24.127	let me tell you how I got here.
26.818	I've performed all over the country.
28.597	And let me tell you,
28.597	America is majestic, right?
30.918	It's got breathtaking nature,
32.667	waffle houses
33.841	and diabetes as far as the eye can see.
35.848	It is really something.
37.784	Now, the American population
37.784	can be broken up
40.047	into three main categories:
41.612	there's mostly wonderful people,
43.374	haters
44.549	and Florida.
45.724	(Laughter)
47.331	Besides Florida, the most troubling
47.331	category here are the Haters.
50.669	They are a minority,
52.882	but they overcompensate
52.882	by being extra loud.
55.409	They have the Napoleon complex
55.409	of demographics,
57.742	and yes, some of the men do wear heels.
59.834	As a social justice comedian,
61.961	it's my goal to convert these haters,
63.853	because they hate a lot of things,
63.853	which leads to negative outcomes,
67.083	like racism, violence and Ted Nugent.
71.4	This is not an exhaustive list;
73.306	I'm probably missing 3-7 items.
75.004	But the point is,
76.25	we have to reckon with the haters.
78.003	But there's variance within this group
79.838	and it's not efficient to go
79.838	after all of them, right?
82.883	So what I've done is created
82.883	a highly scientific Taxonomy of Haters.
86.42	I basically took all of the haters,
88.167	I put them in a petri dish,
88.167	like a scientist,
91.037	and this is what I found.
92.52	(Laughter)
93.695	First off, we have the trolls.
96.013	These are your garden-variety
96.013	digital haters.
98.42	They're the people who quit their jobs
100.31	so they can post on YouTube
100.31	videos all day long.
103.448	There's also the drive-by haters.
106.133	Now, these people will be at a stoplight,
108.449	they'll wait for the light to turn green
110.442	and when it does, they yell,
110.442	"""Go back to your own country!"""
113.288	Now back in the day, they would've
113.288	actually gotten out of their cars
116.529	and hated you to your face.
117.845	But they just don't make them
117.845	like they used to --
120.247	which is another sign
120.247	of the decline in America.
122.556	(Laughter)
124.293	The next category
125.468	is the mission-oriented-bigot-
125.468	whose-group-affiliation-
128.135	gives-them-cover-for-hating hater.
129.827	These guys like to hate
129.827	via a seemingly nice organization,
133.389	like a church or a nonprofit,
135.586	and they oftentimes like to speak
135.586	in an old-timey voice.
138.324	But the group I'm most
138.324	interested in is the swing hater.
142.888	The swing hater is sister
142.888	to the swing voter --
146.499	they just can't decide!
148.252	They're like ideological sluts
150.154	who move from hating to not hating.
152.168	And they do it because they don't have
152.168	enough information.
154.947	This is the group I like to target
154.947	with social justice comedy.
157.949	Why comedy?
159.283	Because on a scale of comedy to brochure,
161.836	the average American prefers comedy,
161.836	as you can see from this graph.
165.558	(Laughter)
166.733	Comedy is very popular.
168.117	And by the way,
169.292	this is a mathematically accurate graph,
171.262	generated from fake numbers.
172.81	(Laughter)
174.311	Now, the question is:
175.52	Why does social justice comedy work?
178.329	Because, first off, it makes you laugh.
181.052	And when you're laughing,
181.052	you enter into a state of openness.
184.238	And in that moment of openness,
185.82	a good social justice comedian
185.82	can stick in a whole bunch of information,
189.508	and if they're really skilled,
191.062	a rectal exam.
192.237	(Laughter)
194.794	Here are some ground rules
194.794	for social justice comedy:
198.019	first off, it's not partisan.
200.002	This isn't political comedy,
200.002	this is about justice,
202.567	and no one is against justice.
204.288	Two, it's inviting and warm,
206.305	it makes you feel like you're sitting
206.305	inside of a burrito.
209.09	Three, it's funny but sneaky,
211.519	like you could be hearing
211.519	an interesting treatise
214.339	on income inequality,
215.577	that's encased in a really
215.577	sophisticated poop joke.
218.515	(Laughter)
220.158	Here's how I see
220.158	social justice comedy working.
223.205	A few years ago, I rounded up a bunch
223.205	of Muslim-American comedians --
226.527	in a non-violent way --
227.717	(Laughter)
229.265	And we went around the country
230.761	to places like Alabama, Arizona,
230.761	Tennessee, Georgia --
233.722	places where they love the Muzzies --
235.945	and we did stand-up shows.
238.657	We called the tour
238.657	"""The Muslims Are Coming!"""
240.995	(Laughter)
243.284	We turned this into a movie,
245.014	and then after the movie came out,
247.262	a known hate group spent 300,000 dollars
250.689	on an anti-Muslim poster campaign
252.834	with the MTA -- that's
252.834	the New York City subway system.
255.729	Now, the posters were truly offensive,
257.599	not to mentioned poorly designed --
259.384	I mean, if you're going to be bigoted,
261.242	you might as well use a better font.
263.018	(Laughter)
264.043	But we decided, why not launch
264.043	our own poster campaign
268.019	that says nice things about Muslims,
269.917	while promoting the movie.
271.188	So myself and fellow comedian
271.188	Dean Obeidallah
273.337	decided to launch the fighting-bigotry-
273.337	with-delightful-posters campaign.
276.857	We raised the money, worked
276.857	with the MTA for over 5 months,
280.631	got the posters approved,
281.966	and two days after they
281.966	were supposed to go up,
284.869	the MTA decided to ban the posters,
288.04	citing political content.
289.9	Let's take a look
289.9	at a couple of those posters.
292.157	Here's one.
293.475	Facts about Muslims:
294.713	Muslims invented
294.713	the concept of a hospital.
296.834	OK.
298.009	Fact: Grown-up Muslims can do
298.009	more push-ups than baby Muslims.
302.04	(Laughter)
303.603	Fact: Muslims invented Justin Timberlake.
306.475	(Laughter)
307.578	Let's take a look at another one.
309.484	The ugly truth about Muslims:
310.937	they have great frittata recipes.
313.549	Now clearly, frittatas are considered
313.549	political by the MTA.
318.08	Either that, or the mere mention
318.08	of Muslims in a positive light
321.561	was considered political -- but it isn't.
323.609	It's about justice.
324.886	So we decided to change
326.069	our fighting-bigortry-
326.069	with-delightful-posters campaign
328.701	and turn it into the fighting-bigotry-
328.701	with-a-delightful-lawsuit campaign.
332.224	(Laughter)
333.863	So basically, what I'm saying
333.863	is a couple of dirt-bag comedians
336.851	took on a major New York City agency
339.406	and the comedians won.
340.97	(Applause and cheers)
343.57	Thank you.
344.745	Victory was a very weird feeling.
346.492	"I was like, ""Is this what"
346.492	blonde girls feel like all the time?
349.452	"'Cause this is amazing!"""
350.795	(Laughter)
353.702	Here's another example.
355.999	I'm asked everywhere I go:
355.999	"""Why don't Muslims denounce terrorism?"""
359.252	We do. But OK, I'll take the bait.
361.467	So I decided to launch
361.467	thedailydenouncer.com.
364.137	It's a website that denounces
364.137	terrorism every day of the week,
367.121	while taking the weekends off.
368.626	Let's take a look at an example.
371.008	They generally appear
371.008	as single-panel cartoons,
373.429	"""I denounce terrorism! I also denounce"
373.429	"people who never fill the paper tray!"""
377.872	The point of the website
377.872	is that it denounces terrorism
380.711	while recognizing that it's ridiculous
382.871	that we have to constantly
382.871	denounce terrorism.
385.656	But if bigotry isn't your thing,
387.931	social justice comedy is useful
387.931	for all sorts of issues.
391.346	For example, myself and fellow
391.346	comedian Lee Camp
394.261	went to the Cayman Islands
394.261	to investigate offshore banking.
397.75	Now, the United States loses
397.75	something like 300 billion dollars a year
402.679	in these offshore tax havens.
404.528	Not to brag,
405.806	but at the end of every month,
407.298	I have something like 5-15 dollars
407.298	in disposable income.
409.966	So we walked into these banks
409.966	in the Cayman Islands
412.462	and asked if we could
412.462	open up a bank account
414.642	with eight dollars and 27 cents.
416.712	(Laughter)
418.539	The bank managers would indulge us
418.539	for 30-45 seconds before calling security.
423.994	Security would come out,
423.994	brandish their weapons,
426.59	and then we would squeal
426.59	with fear and run away,
429.384	because -- and this is the last
429.384	rule of social justice comedy --
432.437	sometimes it makes you want
432.437	to take a dump in your pants.
435.175	Most of my work is meant to be fun.
438.046	It's meant to generate
438.046	a connection and laughter.
441.157	But yes, sometimes I get
441.157	run off the grounds by security.
444.513	Sometimes I get mean tweets and hate mail.
447.504	Sometimes I get voice mails saying
447.504	that if I continue telling my jokes,
452.403	they'll kill me
452.403	and they'll kill my family.
455.489	And those death threats
455.489	are definitely not funny.
459.287	But despite the occasional danger,
461.445	I still think that social justice comedy
461.445	is one of our best weapons.
465.369	I mean, we've tried
465.369	a lot of approaches to social justice,
468.448	like war and competitive ice dancing.
470.994	But still, a lot of things
470.994	are still kind of awful.
475.265	So I think it's time we try and tell
475.265	a really good poop joke.
479.033	Thank you.
480.208	(Applause)
