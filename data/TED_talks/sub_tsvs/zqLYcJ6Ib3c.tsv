13.4	Hello.
14.64	My name is Matthew Williams,
16.6	and I am a champion.
19.52	I have won medals
19.52	in three different sports
22.4	and national games in Canada,
25.16	competed at the international
25.16	level in basketball
28.68	and was proud to represent Canada
31.76	on the world stage.
33.4	(Applause)
39.04	I train five days a week
39.04	for basketball and speed skating,
43.28	work with top quality coaches
45.68	and mental performance consultants
48.2	to be at my best in my sport.
52.64	By the way, all that
52.64	is through Special Olympics.
56.6	Does that change the way you think of me
58.92	and my accomplishments?
63.24	The world does not see
63.24	all people like me as champions.
67.72	Not long ago, people like me
67.72	were shunned and hidden away.
74.24	There has been lots of change
74.24	since Special Olympics began in 1968,
79.4	but in too many cases,
81.56	people with intellectual disabilities
84.4	are invisible to the wider population.
89.88	People use the r-word in front of me,
89.88	and they think it doesn't matter.
95.12	"That's the word ""retard"" or ""retarded"""
98.2	used in a derogatory manner.
101.4	They're not thinking about how much
101.4	it hurts me and my friends.
108	I don't want you to think
108	I'm here because I'm a charity case.
111.88	I am here because there is still
111.88	a big problem with the way
115.92	many people see individuals
115.92	with intellectual disabilities,
121.68	or, too often,
123.28	how they don't see them at all.
126.48	Did you know the World Games
126.48	happened this year?
130.2	I was one of over 6,500 athletes
130.2	with intellectual disabilities
136.12	from 165 countries who competed in LA.
140.96	There was over 62,000 spectators
140.96	watching opening ceremonies,
146.28	and there was live coverage
146.28	on TSN and ESPN.
151.2	Did you even know that happened?
155.6	What do you think of
155.6	when you see someone like me?
159.76	I am here today to challenge you
162.56	to look at us as equals.
167.16	Special Olympics transforms
167.16	the self-identity of athletes
171.36	with intellectual disabilities
173.76	and the perceptions of everyone watching.
178.2	For those of you who aren't familiar,
180.32	Special Olympics is for athletes
180.32	with intellectual disabilities.
186.8	Special Olympics is separate
186.8	from the Paralympics and Olympics.
192.32	We offer high-quality,
192.32	year round sports programs
196.08	for people with intellectual disabilities
199.28	that changes lives and perceptions.
204.44	This movement has changed my life
207.08	and those of so many others.
209.8	And it has changed the way
211.72	the world sees people
211.72	with intellectual disabilities.
217.48	I was born with epilepsy
217.48	and an intellectual disability.
223.28	Growing up, I played hockey
223.28	until I was 12 years old.
228.88	The older I got, the more I felt
231.6	it was harder to keep up
231.6	with everyone else,
235	and I was angry and frustrated.
239.8	For a while, I did not play any sports,
243.32	didn't have many friends
245.24	and felt left out and sad.
250.08	There was a time when people
250.08	with intellectual disabilities
254.52	were hidden away from society.
258.88	No one thought they could
258.88	participate in sports,
262.08	let alone be a valued member of society.
266.88	In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden,
270.64	a scientist at the University of Toronto,
273.959	was studying the effects
273.959	of regular exercise
277.64	on the fitness levels of children
277.64	with intellectual disabilities.
283.84	Using rigorous scientific research,
287.12	Dr. Hayden and other researchers
289.88	came to the conclusion
291.8	that it was simply the lack
291.8	of opportunity to participate
295.84	that caused their fitness
295.84	levels to suffer.
300.4	Lots of people doubted
300.4	that people with intellectual disabilities
304.8	could benefit from fitness programs
307.76	and sports competition opportunities.
311.88	But pioneers like Dr. Hayden
311.88	and Eunice Kennedy Shriver,
316.88	the founder of Special Olympics,
319.2	persevered,
320.68	and Special Olympics athletes
320.68	have proved them right
324.12	four and a half million times over.
327.68	(Applause)
333.36	Before I joined Special Olympics,
335.6	I was nervous
337.12	because I was young, shy, not confident
341.36	and didn't have many friends.
344.6	When I got there, though,
344.6	everyone was very encouraging,
348.32	supportive, and let me be myself
351.64	without being judged.
354.88	Now, I am a basketball player
354.88	and speed skater
359.12	who has competed
359.12	at provincial, national games,
362.96	and this year made it all the way
362.96	to the World Summer Games in LA,
367.68	where I was part of the first ever
367.68	Canadian basketball team
371.52	to compete at World Games.
373.96	(Applause)
381.76	I am one of more than four and a half
381.76	million athletes around the globe,
386.2	and I've heard so many similar stories.
389.84	Being Special Olympics athletes
392.12	restores our pride and dignity.
397	Special Olympics also addresses
397	critical health needs.
402.4	Studies have shown that, on average,
405.44	men with intellectual disabilities
408.12	die 13 years younger than men without,
411.64	and women with intellectual disabilities
414.6	die 20 years younger than women without.
418.96	Special Olympics keeps us healthy
421.44	by getting us active
423.24	and participating in sport.
425.92	Also, our coaches teach us
425.92	about nutrition and health.
432.84	Special Olympics also provides
432.84	free health screening
436.36	for athletes who have difficulty
436.36	communicating with their doctor
440.88	or accessing health care.
445.48	At the 2015 World Summer Games,
448.24	my Team Canada teammates and I
448.24	played the Nigerian basketball team.
454	The day before our game,
455.84	the Nigerian basketball team went to
455.84	the World Games Healthy Athlete screening,
461.52	where seven of 10 members
463.88	were given hearing aids for free
466.4	and got to hear clearly
466.4	for the first time.
470.4	(Applause)
479.16	The change in them was amazing.
482.04	They were more excited,
482.04	happy and confident,
486.24	because their coach could
486.24	vocally communicate with them.
489.64	And they were emotional
491.44	because they could hear
491.44	the sounds of the basketball,
494.32	the sounds of the whistle
496.32	and the cheering fans in the stands --
499.12	sounds that we take for granted.
503.64	Special Olympics is transforming more
503.64	than just the athlete in their sport.
508.96	Special Olympics is transforming
508.96	their lives off the field.
514.68	This year, research findings showed
517.64	that nearly half of the adults in the US
520.6	don't know a single person
520.6	with an intellectual disability,
525.52	and the 44 percent of Americans
528.08	who don't have personal contact
528.08	with intellectual disabilities
532.52	are significantly
532.52	less accepting and positive.
538.04	Then there's the r-word,
540.2	proving that people
540.2	with intellectual disabilities
543.48	are still invisible
545.32	to far too many people.
549	People use it as a casual
549	term or an insult.
552.56	It was tweeted more than
552.56	nine million times last year,
556.28	and it is deeply hurtful
558.32	to me and my four and a half million
558.32	fellow athletes around the planet.
564.64	People don't think it's insulting,
567	but it is.
569.68	As my fellow athlete and global messenger
569.68	John Franklin Stephens wrote
575.08	in an open letter to a political pundit
578.52	who used the r-word as an insult,
582.08	"""Come join us someday at Special Olympics."
585.12	See if you walk away
585.12	"with your heart unchanged."""
590.16	(Applause)
599.72	This year, at the 2015 World Summer Games,
603.96	people lined up for hours
605.92	to get into the final night
605.92	of powerlifting competition.
609.96	So it was standing room only
609.96	when my teammate Jackie Barrett,
614.36	the Newfoundland Moose,
616.16	deadlifted 655 pounds
619.68	and lifted 611 pounds in the squat --
623.96	(Applause)
631.28	setting huge new records
631.28	for Special Olympics.
636.12	Jackie is a record holder
636.12	among all powerlifters in Newfoundland --
640.92	not just Special Olympics,
640.92	all powerlifters.
645.92	Jackie was a huge star in LA,
648.76	and ESPN live-tweeted
648.76	his record-breaking lifts
653.36	and were wowed by his performance.
657.48	Fifty years ago, few imagined
657.48	individuals with intellectual disabilities
663.32	could do anything like that.
666.88	This year, 60,000 spectators filled
666.88	the famous LA Memorial Coliseum
674	to watch the opening
674	ceremonies of World Games
677.68	and cheer athletes from 165 countries
681.48	around the world.
683.84	Far from being hidden away,
686.08	we were cheered and celebrated.
691	Special Olympics teaches athletes
693.76	to be confident and proud of themselves.
697.76	Special Olympics teaches the world
700.2	that people with intellectual disabilities
703.04	deserve respect and inclusion.
706.36	(Applause)
714.52	Now, I have dreams
714.52	and achievements in my sport,
718.92	great coaches,
720.56	respect and dignity,
723	better health,
724.24	and I am pursuing a career
724.24	as a personal trainer.
728.2	(Applause)
735.32	I am no longer hidden, bullied
738.32	and I am here doing a TED Talk.
741.04	(Applause)
776.24	The world is a different place
776.24	because of Special Olympics,
781.6	but there is still farther to go.
784.32	So the next time you see someone
784.32	with an intellectual disability,
788.44	I hope you will see their ability.
791.48	The next time someone uses
791.48	the r-word near you,
794.64	I hope you will tell them
794.64	how much it hurts.
798	I hope you will think about getting
798	involved with Special Olympics.
803.6	(Applause)
807.24	I would like to leave you
807.24	with one final thought.
811.32	Nelson Mandela said,
813	"""Sports has the power"
813	"to change the world."""
817.04	Special Olympics is changing the world
819.92	by transforming
819.92	four and a half million athletes
823.52	and giving us a place to be confident,
826.32	meet friends,
827.92	not be judged
829.6	and get to feel like and be champions.
833.4	Thank you very much.
834.8	(Applause)
