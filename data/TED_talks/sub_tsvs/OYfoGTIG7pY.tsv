19.21	I and my colleagues Art Aron
19.21	and Lucy Brown and others,
22.882	have put 37 people who are madly in love
22.882	into a functional MRI brain scanner.
31.36	and we're just starting
31.36	our third experiment:
33.52	studying people who report
33.52	that they're still in love
36.05	after 10 to 25 years of marriage.
38.33	So, this is the short story
38.33	of that research.
42.88	In the jungles of Guatemala,
42.88	in Tikal, stands a temple.
47.454	It was built by the grandest Sun King,
47.454	of the grandest city-state,
52.445	of the grandest civilization
52.445	of the Americas, the Mayas.
57.095	His name was Jasaw Chan K'awiil.
59.804	He stood over six feet tall.
62.107	He lived into his 80s,
64.148	and he was buried beneath
64.148	this monument in 720 AD.
68.508	And Mayan inscriptions proclaim
68.508	that he was deeply in love with his wife.
72.588	So, he built a temple
72.588	in her honor, facing his.
76.449	And every spring and autumn,
76.449	exactly at the equinox,
80.441	the sun rises behind his temple,
82.9	and perfectly bathes her temple
82.9	with his shadow.
87.96	And as the sun sets
87.96	behind her temple in the afternoon,
91.735	it perfectly bathes
91.735	his temple with her shadow.
95.743	After 1,300 years, these two lovers
95.743	still touch and kiss from their tomb.
102.806	Around the world, people love.
105.123	They sing for love, they dance for love,
107.891	they compose poems and stories about love.
110.923	They tell myths and legends about love.
113.522	They pine for love, they live for love,
113.522	they kill for love, and they die for love.
119.372	As Walt Whitman once said,
119.372	"""O I would stake all for you."""
124.117	Anthropologists have found evidence
124.117	of romantic love in 170 societies.
128.33	They've never found a society
128.33	that did not have it.
132.446	But love isn't always a happy experience.
135.17	In one study of college students,
135.17	they asked a lot of questions about love,
139.093	but the two that stood out
139.093	to me the most were:
142.056	"""Have you ever been rejected"
142.056	"by somebody who you really loved?"""
146.686	And the second question was:
148.127	"""Have you ever dumped somebody"
148.127	"who really loved you?"""
151.943	And almost 95 percent of both men
151.943	and women said yes to both.
157.249	Almost nobody gets out of love alive.
160.858	So, before I start telling you
160.858	about the brain,
164.137	I want to read for you
165.621	what I think is the most powerful
165.621	love poem on Earth.
168.33	There's other love poems that are,
168.33	of course, just as good,
171.171	but I don't think this one
171.171	can be surpassed.
173.767	It was told by an anonymous
173.767	Kwakiutl Indian of southern Alaska
178.478	to a missionary in 1896.
181.967	And here it is.
183.217	I've never had the opportunity
183.217	to say it before.
186.825	"""Fire runs through my body"
186.825	with the pain of loving you.
190.878	Pain runs through my body
190.878	with the fires of my love for you.
194.97	Pain like a boil about to burst
194.97	with my love for you,
198.837	consumed by fire with my love for you.
201.952	I remember what you said to me.
204.082	I am thinking of your love for me.
206.191	I am torn by your love for me.
208.54	Pain and more pain --
210.502	where are you going with my love?
212.563	I am told you will go from here.
214.363	I am told you will leave me here.
216.83	My body is numb with grief.
219.019	Remember what I said, my love.
221.102	"Goodbye, my love, goodbye."""
224.975	Emily Dickinson once wrote,
224.975	"""Parting is all we need to know of hell."""
231.186	How many people have suffered
233.328	in all the millions of years
233.328	of human evolution?
236.947	How many people around the world
239.106	are dancing with elation
239.106	at this very minute?
242.463	Romantic love is one of the most powerful
242.463	sensations on Earth.
246.707	So, several years ago,
246.707	I decided to look into the brain
250.165	and study this madness.
253.029	Our first study of people
253.029	who were happily in love
255.63	has been widely publicized,
256.995	so I'm only going to say
256.995	very little about it.
259.513	We found activity in a tiny,
259.513	little factory near the base of the brain
263.517	called the ventral tegmental area.
265.687	We found activity in some cells
265.687	called the A10 cells,
268.855	cells that actually make
268.855	dopamine, a natural stimulant,
271.808	and spray it to many brain regions.
274.108	Indeed, this part, the VTA,
274.108	is part of the brain's reward system.
278.243	It's way below your cognitive
278.243	thinking process.
280.84	It's below your emotions.
282.455	It's part of what we call
282.455	the reptilian core of the brain,
285.708	associated with wanting, with motivation,
285.708	with focus and with craving.
290.978	In fact, the same brain region
290.978	where we found activity
294.108	becomes active also
294.108	when you feel the rush of cocaine.
297.981	But romantic love is much more
297.981	than a cocaine high --
300.948	at least you come down from cocaine.
303.283	Romantic love is an obsession,
303.283	it possesses you.
306.588	You lose your sense of self.
308.271	You can't stop thinking
308.271	about another human being.
311.663	Somebody is camping in your head.
314.08	As an eighth-century Japanese poet said,
314.08	"""My longing had no time when it ceases."""
320.68	Wild is love.
323.013	And the obsession can get worse
323.013	when you've been rejected.
326.625	So, right now, Lucy Brown and I,
326.625	the neuroscientists on our project,
331.33	are looking at the data of the people
333.331	who were put into the machine
333.331	after they had just been dumped.
336.686	It was very difficult actually,
336.686	putting these people in the machine,
339.911	because they were in such bad shape.
341.67	(Laughter)
345.33	So anyway, we found activity
345.33	in three brain regions.
347.973	We found activity in the brain region,
350.468	in exactly the same brain region
350.468	associated with intense romantic love.
355.083	What a bad deal.
356.983	You know, when you've been dumped,
358.655	the one thing you love to do
358.655	is just forget about this human being,
361.876	and then go on with your life --
361.876	but no, you just love them harder.
365.925	As the poet Terence,
365.925	the Roman poet once said,
369.517	"he said, ""The less my hope,"
369.517	"the hotter my love."""
372.558	And indeed, we now know why.
374.818	Two thousand years later,
374.818	we can explain this in the brain.
378.06	That brain system -- the reward system
380.483	for wanting, for motivation,
380.483	for craving, for focus --
384.33	becomes more active
384.33	when you can't get what you want.
387.816	In this case, life's greatest prize:
387.816	an appropriate mating partner.
392.6	We found activity
392.6	in other brain regions also --
395.382	in a brain region associated
395.382	with calculating gains and losses.
400.298	You're lying there,
400.298	you're looking at the picture,
402.669	and you're in this machine,
404.002	and you're calculating what went wrong.
406.199	What have I lost?
408.771	As a matter of fact, Lucy and I
408.771	have a little joke about this.
412.443	It comes from a David Mamet play,
415.33	and there's two con artists in the play,
417.428	and the woman is conning the man,
419.33	and the man looks at the woman and says,
421.535	"""Oh, you're a bad pony,"
421.535	"I'm not going to bet on you."""
426.511	And indeed, it's this part of the brain,
429.105	the core of the nucleus accumbens,
431.035	that is becoming active
431.035	as you're measuring your gains and losses.
434.657	It's also the brain region
434.657	that becomes active
437.027	when you're willing to take enormous risks
437.027	for huge gains and huge losses.
441.948	Last but not least,
441.948	we found activity in a brain region
445.234	associated with deep attachment
445.234	to another individual.
449.913	No wonder people suffer around the world,
449.913	and we have so many crimes of passion.
456.06	When you've been rejected in love,
458.2	not only are you engulfed
458.2	with feelings of romantic love,
462.153	but you're feeling deep
462.153	attachment to this individual.
464.931	Moreover, this brain circuit
464.931	for reward is working,
468.202	and you're feeling intense energy,
468.202	intense focus, intense motivation
473.402	and the willingness to risk it all,
473.402	to win life's greatest prize.
479.807	So, what have I learned
479.807	from this experiment
482.725	that I would like to tell the world?
484.471	Foremost, I have come to think
486.873	that romantic love is a drive,
486.873	a basic mating drive.
490.319	Not the sex drive --
491.519	the sex drive gets you looking
491.519	for a whole range of partners.
494.413	Romantic love enables you
494.413	to focus your mating energy
496.943	on just one at a time,
496.943	conserve your mating energy,
499.765	and start the mating process
499.765	with this single individual.
503.447	I think of all the poetry
503.447	that I've read about romantic love,
507.088	what sums it up best
507.088	is something that is said by Plato
510.934	over 2,000 years ago.
513.061	"He said, ""The god of love"
513.061	lives in a state of need.
517.171	It is a need, it is an urge,
517.171	it is a homeostatic imbalance.
522.483	Like hunger and thirst,
522.483	"it's almost impossible to stamp out."""
527.411	I've also come to believe
527.411	that romantic love is an addiction:
530.722	a perfectly wonderful addiction
530.722	when it's going well,
533.293	and a perfectly horrible addiction
533.293	when it's going poorly.
536.389	And indeed, it has all
536.389	of the characteristics of addiction.
539.201	You focus on the person,
539.201	you obsessively think about them,
542.578	you crave them, you distort reality,
545.33	your willingness to take enormous
545.33	risks to win this person.
548.654	And it's got the three main
548.654	characteristics of addiction:
551.365	tolerance, you need to see them
551.365	more, and more, and more;
554.07	withdrawals;
555.631	and last: relapse.
557.053	I've got a girlfriend who's just
557.053	getting over a terrible love affair.
560.703	It's been about eight months,
560.703	she's beginning to feel better.
563.61	And she was driving along
563.61	in her car the other day,
566.1	and suddenly she heard a song
566.1	on the car radio
568.292	that reminded her of this man.
569.751	Not only did the instant
569.751	craving come back,
572.638	but she had to pull over
572.638	from the side of the road and cry.
576.704	So, one thing I would like
576.704	the medical community,
579.095	and the legal community,
579.095	and even the college community,
581.818	to see if they can understand,
581.818	that indeed, romantic love
585.655	is one of the most addictive
585.655	substances on Earth.
588.745	I would also like to tell the world
588.745	that animals love.
592.464	There's not an animal on this planet
594.659	that will copulate with anything
594.659	that comes along.
597.079	Too old, too young, too scruffy,
597.079	too stupid, and they won't do it.
601.8	Unless you're stuck
601.8	in a laboratory cage --
604.33	and you know, if you spend
604.33	your entire life in a little box,
608.05	you're not going to be as picky
608.05	about who you have sex with,
611.33	but I've looked in a hundred species,
614.231	and everywhere in the wild,
614.231	animals have favorites.
617.33	As a matter of fact,
617.33	ethologists know this.
619.357	There are over eight words
619.357	"for what they call ""animal favoritism:"""
623.33	selective proceptivity, mate choice,
623.33	female choice, sexual choice.
628.843	And indeed, there are now
628.843	three academic articles
631.843	in which they've looked
631.843	at this attraction,
634.33	which may only last for a second,
636.33	but it's a definite attraction,
638.065	and either this same brain region,
638.065	this reward system,
641.371	or the chemicals of that reward
641.371	system are involved.
644.948	In fact, I think animal attraction
644.948	can be instant --
647.586	you can see an elephant
647.586	instantly go for another elephant.
650.33	And I think that this is really the origin
652.354	of what you and I call
652.354	"""love at first sight."""
656.788	People have often asked me
658.908	whether what I know about love
658.908	has spoiled it for me.
662.936	"And I just simply say, ""Hardly."""
664.97	You can know every single ingredient
664.97	in a piece of chocolate cake,
668.119	and then when you sit down
668.119	and eat that cake,
670.838	you can still feel that joy.
672.681	And certainly, I make all the same
672.681	mistakes that everybody else does too,
676.363	but it's really deepened my understanding
680.626	and compassion, really,
680.626	for all human life.
684.576	As a matter of fact, in New York,
684.576	I often catch myself
687.849	looking in baby carriages
687.849	and feeling a little sorry for the tot.
691.434	And in fact, sometimes
691.434	I feel a little sorry
694.33	for the chicken on my dinner plate,
696.353	when I think of how intense
696.353	this brain system is.
701.561	Our newest experiment has been hatched
706.27	by my colleague, Art Aron --
708.948	putting people who are reporting
708.948	that they are still in love,
712.133	in a long-term relationship,
712.133	into the functional MRI.
715.295	We've put five people in so far,
717.672	and indeed, we found exactly
717.672	the same thing.
720.752	They're not lying.
722.117	The brain areas associated
722.117	with intense romantic love
728.124	still become active, 25 years later.
732.886	There are still many questions
732.886	to be answered
735.33	and asked about romantic love.
738.1	The question that I'm working on
738.1	right this minute --
740.639	and I'm only going to say it
740.639	for a second, and then end --
743.404	is, why do you fall in love
743.404	with one person, rather than another?
746.503	I never would have
746.503	even thought to think of this,
749.33	but Match.com, the Internet dating site,
751.33	came to me three years ago
751.33	and asked me that question.
754.149	And I said, I don't know.
755.498	I know what happens in the brain,
755.498	when you do become in love,
758.899	but I don't know why you fall in love
758.899	with one person rather than another.
762.44	And so, I've spent
762.44	the last three years on this.
765.226	And there are many reasons
765.226	that you fall in love with one person
768.262	rather than another,
768.262	that psychologists can tell you.
770.777	And we tend to fall in love with somebody
770.777	from the same socioeconomic background,
774.634	the same general level of intelligence,
774.634	of good looks, the same religious values.
778.492	Your childhood certainly plays a role,
778.492	but nobody knows how.
781.33	And that's about it, that's all they know.
783.515	No, they've never found
785.149	the way two personalities
785.149	fit together to make a good relationship.
789.532	So, it began to occur to me
791.33	that maybe your biology pulls you
791.33	towards some people rather than another.
796.402	And I have concocted a questionnaire
796.402	to see to what degree
800.962	you express dopamine, serotonin,
800.962	estrogen and testosterone.
805.33	I think we've evolved four
805.33	very broad personality types
808.625	associated with the ratios
808.625	of these four chemicals in the brain.
812.748	And on this dating site
812.748	that I have created, called Chemistry.com,
816.973	I ask you first a series of questions
820.606	to see to what degree
820.606	you express these chemicals,
823.763	and I'm watching who chooses who to love.
827.33	And 3.7 million people have taken
827.33	the questionnaire in America.
831.762	About 600,000 people have taken it
831.762	in 33 other countries.
836.148	I'm putting the data together now,
837.852	and at some point --
837.852	there will always be magic to love,
841.196	but I think I will come closer
841.196	to understanding
844.635	why it is you can walk into a room
844.635	and everybody is from your background,
848.936	your same general level
848.936	of intelligence, good looks,
852.488	and you don't feel
852.488	pulled towards all of them.
854.7	I think there's biology to that.
856.603	I think we're going to end up,
856.603	in the next few years,
859.188	to understand all kinds
859.188	of brain mechanisms
861.402	that pull us to one person
861.402	rather than another.
864.736	So, I will close with this.
867.153	These are my older people.
870.269	"Faulkner said, ""The past is not dead,"
870.269	"it's not even past."""
875.761	Indeed, we carry a lot of luggage
875.761	from our yesteryear in the human brain.
880.742	And so, there's one thing that makes me
880.742	pursue my understanding of human nature,
888.107	and this reminds me of it.
890.132	These are two women.
891.58	Women tend to get intimacy
891.58	differently than men do.
894.736	Women get intimacy
894.736	from face-to-face talking.
897.02	We swivel towards each other,
898.941	we do what we call
898.941	"the ""anchoring gaze"" and we talk."
903.067	This is intimacy to women.
904.654	I think it comes from millions of years
906.563	of holding that baby
906.563	in front of your face,
908.669	cajoling it, reprimanding it,
908.669	educating it with words.
912.103	Men tend to get intimacy
912.103	from side-by-side doing.
915.72	As soon as one guy looks up,
915.72	the other guy will look away.
919.114	(Laughter)
920.837	I think it comes from millions of years
920.837	sitting behind the bush,
925.958	looking straight ahead, trying to hit
925.958	that buffalo on the head with a rock.
930.429	I think, for millions of years,
930.429	men faced their enemies,
933.22	they sat side-by-side with friends.
935.972	So my final statement is: love is in us.
940.248	It's deeply embedded in the brain.
942.84	Our challenge is to understand each other.
945.669	Thank you.
