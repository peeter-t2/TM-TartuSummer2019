15.752	Life is about opportunities --
15.752	creating them and embracing them.
20.982	And for me, that was the Olympic dream.
24.093	That's what defined me. That was my bliss.
27.771	As a cross-country skier
27.771	and member of the Australian ski team
30.961	headed towards the Winter Olympics,
33.092	I was on a training bike ride
33.092	with my fellow teammates.
37.196	As we made our way up
37.196	towards the spectacular Blue Mountains
40.824	west of Sydney,
41.999	it was the perfect autumn day:
44.463	sunshine, the smell
44.463	of eucalypt and a dream.
48.649	Life was good.
50.517	We'd been on our bikes
50.517	for around five-and-a-half hours
53.145	when we got to the part
53.145	of the ride that I loved,
55.595	and that was the hills,
55.595	because I loved the hills.
58.34	I got up off the seat of my bike
58.34	and I started pumping my legs,
62.265	and as I sucked in the cold mountain air,
62.265	I could feel it burning my lungs,
66.107	and I looked up to see
66.107	the sun shining in my face.
70.69	And then everything went black.
73.622	Where was I? What was happening?
76.411	My body was consumed by pain.
80.213	I'd been hit by a speeding utility truck
82.952	with only 10 minutes
82.952	to go on the bike ride.
86.155	I was airlifted from the scene
86.155	of the accident by a rescue helicopter
89.45	to a large spinal unit in Sydney.
91.745	I had extensive
91.745	and life-threatening injuries.
95.368	I'd broken my neck
95.368	and my back in six places.
99.169	I broke five ribs on my left side.
101.485	I broke my right arm.
101.485	I broke my collarbone.
104.293	I broke some bones in my feet.
106.67	My whole right side was ripped open,
106.67	filled with gravel.
109.689	My head was cut open
109.689	across the front, lifted back,
112.094	exposing the skull underneath.
113.791	I had head injures.
113.791	I had internal injuries.
115.917	I had massive blood loss.
117.271	In fact, I lost
117.271	about five liters of blood,
119.374	which is all someone my size
119.374	would actually hold.
121.953	By the time the helicopter arrived
121.953	at Prince Henry Hospital in Sydney,
125.547	my blood pressure was 40 over nothing.
129.469	I was having a really bad day.
131.271	(Laughter)
138.519	For over 10 days, I drifted
138.519	between two dimensions.
143.17	I had an awareness of being in my body,
145.683	but also being out of my body,
145.683	somewhere else,
147.959	watching from above,
147.959	as if it was happening to someone else.
151.006	Why would I want to go back
151.006	to a body that was so broken?
154.853	But this voice kept calling me:
157.648	"""Come on, stay with me."""
159.923	"""No, it's too hard."""
162.826	"""Come on. This is our opportunity."""
165.724	"""No. That body is broken."
165.724	"It can no longer serve me."""
169.761	"""Come on. Stay with me. We can do it."
169.761	"We can do it together."""
174.971	I was at a crossroads.
177.137	I knew if I didn't return to my body,
177.137	I'd have to leave this world forever.
181.955	It was the fight of my life.
185.163	After 10 days, I made the decision
185.163	to return to my body.
190.191	And the internal bleeding stopped.
194.305	The next concern
194.305	was whether I would walk again,
197.421	because I was paralyzed
197.421	from the waist down.
200.222	They said to my parents
200.222	that the neck break was a stable fracture,
203.438	but the back was completely crushed:
205.203	the vertebra at L1
205.203	was like you'd dropped a peanut,
208.613	stepped on it, smashed it
208.613	into thousands of pieces.
211.728	They'd have to operate.
214.303	They went in. They put me on a beanbag.
216.666	They cut me -- literally cut me in half.
218.774	I have a scar that wraps
218.774	around my entire body.
222.226	They picked as much
222.226	broken bone as they could
225.001	that had lodged in my spinal cord.
226.702	They took out two of my broken ribs
226.702	and they rebuilt my back --
230.66	L1, they rebuilt it,
230.66	they took out another broken rib,
233.327	they fused T12, L1 and L2 together.
236.74	Then they stitched me up;
236.74	they took an entire hour to stitch me up.
239.945	I woke up in intensive care,
241.598	and the doctors were really excited
241.598	that the operation had been a success,
245.254	because at that stage,
245.254	I had a little bit of movement
247.849	in one of my big toes,
249.031	"and I thought, ""Great,"
249.031	"because I'm going to the Olympics!"""
252.095	(Laughter)
254.155	I had no idea.
255.785	That's the sort of thing that happens
255.785	to someone else, not me, surely.
259.341	But then the doctor
259.341	came over to me and she said,
261.746	"""Janine, the operation was a success,"
264.58	and we've picked as much bone
264.58	out of your spinal cord as we could.
268.342	But the damage is permanent.
269.755	The central nervous system
269.755	nerves -- there is no cure.
273.381	You're what we call a partial paraplegic,
275.7	and you'll have all of the injuries
275.7	that go along with that.
278.692	You'll have no feeling
278.692	from the waist down,
281.579	and at most, you might get
285.384	You'll have internal injuries
285.384	for the rest of your life.
288.042	You'll have to use a catheter
288.042	for the rest of your life.
291.611	And if you walk again, it will be
291.611	"with calipers and a walking frame."""
295.962	And then she said,
297.161	"""Janine, you'll have to rethink"
297.161	everything you do in your life,
300.311	because you're never going to be able
300.311	"to do the things you did before."""
304.006	(Gasps)
305.107	I tried to grasp what she was saying.
307.543	I was an athlete. That's all I knew.
307.543	That's all I'd done.
310.284	If I couldn't do that,
310.284	then what could I do?
313.112	And the question I asked myself is:
314.946	If I couldn't do that,
317.348	then who was I?
322.915	They moved me from intensive care
322.915	to acute spinal.
326.409	I was lying on a thin, hard spinal bed.
328.663	I had no movement in my legs.
330.148	I had tight stockings on
330.148	to protect from blood clots.
333.52	I had one arm in plaster,
333.52	one arm tied down by drips.
336.411	I had a neck brace and sandbags
336.411	on either side of my head
339.411	and I saw my world through a mirror
341.381	that was suspended above my head.
344.36	I shared the ward with five other people,
347.837	and the amazing thing is,
349.163	because we were all lying paralyzed
349.163	in a spinal ward,
352.733	we didn't know
352.733	what each other looked like.
355.163	How amazing is that?
356.981	How often in life do you get to make
356.981	friendships, judgment-free,
363.139	purely based on spirit?
366.06	And there were
366.06	no superficial conversations
368.717	as we shared our innermost
368.717	thoughts, our fears,
371.791	and our hopes for life
371.791	after the spinal ward.
376.361	I remember one night,
376.361	one of the nurses came in, Jonathan,
380.237	with a whole lot of plastic straws.
383.311	He put a pile on top
383.311	of each of us, and he said,
385.597	"""Start threading them together."""
388.445	Well, there wasn't much else to do
388.445	in the spinal ward, so we did.
391.747	(Laughter)
392.796	And when we'd finished,
392.796	he went around silently
395.637	and he joined all of the straws up
395.637	till it looped around the whole ward.
400.977	And then he said,
402.168	"""OK everybody, hold on to your straws."""
405.505	"And we did. And he said, ""Right ..."
409.213	"Now we're all connected."""
412.729	And as we held on and we breathed as one,
418.033	we knew we weren't on this journey alone.
422.293	And even lying paralyzed
422.293	in the spinal ward ...
427.002	there were moments of incredible
427.002	depth and richness,
430.219	of authenticity and connection
433.503	that I had never experienced before.
437.709	And each of us knew
437.709	that when we left the spinal ward,
442.497	we would never be the same.
447.546	After six months, it was time to go home.
451.21	I remember Dad pushing me
451.21	outside in my wheelchair,
454.726	wrapped in a plaster body cast,
457.668	and feeling the sun on my face
457.668	for the first time.
460.89	I soaked it up and I thought,
462.313	"""How could I ever"
462.313	"have taken this for granted?"""
466.73	I felt so incredibly grateful for my life.
470.463	But before I left hospital,
471.867	the head nurse had said to me,
471.867	"""Janine, I want you to be ready,"
474.923	because when you get home,
474.923	"something's going to happen."""
477.632	"And I said, ""What?"""
478.821	"And she said, ""You're going"
478.821	"to get depressed."""
481.558	"And I said, ""Not me,"
481.558	"not Janine the Machine,"""
484.568	which was my nickname.
486.306	"She said, ""You are, because,"
486.306	see, it happens to everyone.
489.413	In the spinal ward, that's normal.
489.413	You're in a wheelchair. That's normal.
493.688	But you're going to get home
493.688	"and realize how different life is."""
497.95	And I got home.
500.312	And something happened.
503.901	I realized Sister Sam was right.
507.259	I did get depressed.
510.203	I was in my wheelchair.
511.98	I had no feeling from the waist down,
513.857	attached to a catheter bottle.
515.334	I couldn't walk.
517.073	I'd lost so much weight in hospital,
519.264	I now weighed about 80 pounds.
523.31	And I wanted to give up.
525.17	All I wanted to do was put my running
525.17	shoes on and run out the door.
529.266	I wanted my old life back.
529.266	I wanted my body back.
532.449	And I can remember
532.449	Mom sitting on the end of my bed
534.875	"and saying, ""I wonder if life"
534.875	"will ever be good again."""
538.845	"And I thought, ""How could it?"
541.581	Because I've lost
541.581	everything that I valued,
545.11	everything that I'd worked towards.
547.243	"Gone."""
550.253	And the question I asked was,
550.253	"""Why me? Why me?"""
555.171	And then I remembered
557.991	my friends that were still
557.991	in the spinal ward,
561.036	particularly Maria.
563.147	Maria was in a car accident,
564.632	and she woke up on her 16th birthday
566.581	to the news that she was
566.581	a complete quadriplegic,
569.7	had no movement from the neck down,
571.993	had damage to her vocal chords,
571.993	and she couldn't talk.
576.007	"They told me, ""We're going"
576.007	to move you next to her
578.384	"because we think it will be good for her."""
581.453	I was worried. I didn't know
581.453	how I'd react to being next to her.
585.963	I knew it would be challenging,
585.963	but it was actually a blessing,
589.853	because Maria always smiled.
594.696	She was always happy,
594.696	and even when she began to talk again,
599.456	albeit difficult to understand,
599.456	she never complained, not once.
605.458	And I wondered how had she ever
605.458	found that level of acceptance.
611.018	And I realized
611.018	that this wasn't just my life;
615.831	it was life itself.
617.669	I realized that this wasn't just my pain;
617.669	it was everybody's pain.
622.574	And then I knew, just like before,
625.444	that I had a choice:
625.444	I could keep fighting this,
630.204	or I could let go
630.204	and accept not only my body,
634.831	but the circumstances of my life.
638.315	"And then I stopped asking, ""Why me?"""
641.736	"And I started to ask, ""Why not me?"""
645.192	And then I thought to myself,
647.508	maybe being at rock bottom
647.508	is actually the perfect place to start.
656.656	I had never before thought of myself
656.656	as a creative person.
659.699	I was an athlete; my body was a machine.
663.773	But now I was about to embark
663.773	on the most creative project
668.219	that any of us could ever do:
670.227	that of rebuilding a life.
673.252	And even though I had absolutely
673.252	no idea what I was going to do,
676.711	in that uncertainty came
676.711	a sense of freedom.
680.879	I was no longer tied to a set path.
683.865	I was free to explore
683.865	life's infinite possibilities.
689.518	And that realization
689.518	was about to change my life.
695.855	Sitting at home in my wheelchair
695.855	and my plaster body cast,
700.468	an airplane flew overhead.
703.742	I looked up, and I thought
703.742	"to myself, ""That's it!"
708.135	If I can't walk,
708.135	"then I might as well fly."""
710.905	(Laughter)
711.944	"I said, ""Mom, I'm going"
711.944	"to learn how to fly."""
714.597	"She said, ""That's nice, dear."""
716.375	(Laughter)
718.474	"I said, ""Pass me the yellow pages."""
720.869	She passed me the phone book,
720.869	I rang up the flying school,
723.626	I said I'd like to make a booking
723.626	to come out for a flight.
726.471	"They said, ""When do you want to come out?"""
728.811	"I said, ""Well, I have to get a friend"
728.811	to drive me because I can't drive.
732.405	Sort of can't walk, either.
732.405	"Is that a problem?"""
734.823	I made a booking, and weeks later,
736.497	my friend Chris and my mom
736.497	drove me out to the airport,
739.294	all 80 pounds of me covered
739.294	in a plaster body cast
741.716	in a baggy pair of overalls.
743.174	(Laughter)
744.296	I can tell you, I did not
744.296	look like the ideal candidate
747.076	to get a pilot's license.
748.466	(Laughter)
750.084	I'm holding on to the counter
750.084	because I can't stand.
752.561	"I said, ""Hi, I'm here"
752.561	"for a flying lesson."""
754.649	They took one look and ran
754.649	out the back to draw short straws.
758.307	"""You get her."" ""No, no, you take her."""
761.274	"Finally a guy goes, ""Hi, I'm Andrew."
761.274	"I'm going to take you flying."""
764.493	"I go, ""Great!"""
765.691	They get me out on the tarmac,
767.41	and there was this red, white and blue
767.41	airplane -- it was beautiful.
770.902	They had to slide me up on the wing
770.902	to put me in the cockpit.
774.712	They sat me down. There are buttons
774.712	and dials everywhere.
777.495	"I'm going, ""Wow, how do you ever know"
777.495	"what all these buttons and dials do?"""
781.124	Andrew got in the front,
781.124	started the plane, and said,
783.799	"""Would you like to have a go at taxiing?"""
785.801	That's when you use your feet
785.801	to control the rudder pedals
788.571	to control the airplane on the ground.
790.442	"I said, ""No, I can't use my legs."""
792.341	"He went, ""Oh."""
793.548	"I said, ""But I can use"
793.548	"my hands,"" and he said, ""OK."""
796.374	So he got over to the runway,
796.374	and he applied the power.
799.331	And as we took off down the runway,
801.575	and the wheels lifted up off the tarmac,
801.575	and we became airborne,
806.322	I had the most incredible
806.322	sense of freedom.
810.925	And Andrew said to me,
813.497	as we got over the training area,
816.234	"""You see that mountain over there?"""
818.51	"And I said, ""Yeah."""
820.077	"And he said, ""Well, you take the controls,"
820.077	"and you fly towards that mountain."""
824.578	And as I looked up, I realized
827.061	that he was pointing
827.061	towards the Blue Mountains,
830.526	where the journey had begun.
833.756	And I took the controls,
836.159	and I was flying.
838.238	And I was a long, long way
838.238	from that spinal ward.
841.2	I knew right then
841.2	that I was going to be a pilot.
844.973	Didn't know how on Earth
844.973	I'd ever pass a medical.
847.629	(Laughter)
848.763	But I'd worry about that later,
848.763	because right now, I had a dream.
852.042	So I went home, I got a training
852.042	diary out, and I had a plan.
856.344	And I practiced my walking
856.344	as much as I could,
859.087	and I went from the point
859.087	of two people holding me up ...
862.833	to one person holding me up ...
865.23	to the point where I could
865.23	walk around the furniture
867.722	as long as it wasn't too far apart.
869.481	And then I made great progression,
871.242	to the point where I could walk
871.242	around the house,
873.552	holding onto the walls, like this.
875.685	And Mom said she was forever following me,
877.94	wiping off my fingerprints.
879.463	(Laughter)
881.836	But at least she always knew where I was.
884	(Laughter)
886.102	So while the doctors continued to operate
888.599	and put my body back together again,
890.675	I went on with my theory study.
893.329	And then eventually, amazingly,
893.329	I passed my pilot's medical,
897.679	and that was my green light to fly.
899.911	And I spent every moment I could
899.911	out at that flying school,
902.753	way out of my comfort zone,
904.331	all these young guys that wanted
904.331	to be Qantas pilots, you know,
907.426	and little old hop-along me
907.426	in first my plaster cast,
910.379	and then my steel brace,
910.379	my baggy overalls,
912.878	my bag of medication
912.878	and catheters and my limp.
916.478	They use to look at me and think,
918.116	"""Oh, who is she kidding?"
918.116	"She's never going to be able to do this."""
921.418	And sometimes I thought that, too.
923.226	But that didn't matter,
924.853	because now there was something
924.853	inside that burned
927.659	that far outweighed my injuries.
931.691	And little goals
931.691	kept me going along the way,
934.005	and eventually I got
934.005	my private pilot's license.
937.482	Then I learned to navigate,
937.482	and I flew my friends around Australia.
942.612	And then I learned to fly
942.612	an airplane with two engines
945.587	and I got my twin-engine rating.
948.006	And then I learned to fly in bad weather
948.006	as well as fine weather,
951.34	and got my instrument rating.
953.829	And then I got
953.829	my commercial pilot's license.
956.52	And then I got my instructor rating.
959.558	And then I found myself
959.558	back at that same school
962.442	where I'd gone for that very first flight,
964.934	teaching other people how to fly ...
967.938	just under 18 months
967.938	after I'd left the spinal ward.
972.076	(Applause)
981.839	(Applause ends)
983.918	"And then I thought, ""Why stop there?"
985.945	"Why not learn to fly upside down?"""
987.991	(Laughter)
989.117	And I did, and I learned
989.117	to fly upside down
991.927	and became an aerobatics
991.927	flying instructor.
994.276	(Laughter)
996.148	And Mom and Dad? Never been up.
999.155	(Laughter)
1002.647	But then I knew for certain
1002.647	that although my body might be limited,
1007.9	it was my spirit that was unstoppable.
1013.68	The philosopher Lao Tzu once said,
1017.003	"""When you let go of what you are,"
1019.026	"you become what you might be."""
1022.457	I now know that it wasn't until I let go
1022.457	of who I thought I was
1027.757	that I was able to create
1027.757	a completely new life.
1031.74	It wasn't until I let go
1031.74	of the life I thought I should have ...
1037.121	that I was able to embrace
1037.121	the life that was waiting for me.
1041.532	I now know that my real strength
1044.205	never came from my body.
1047.601	And although my physical capabilities
1047.601	have changed dramatically,
1052.524	who I am is unchanged.
1056.675	The pilot light inside of me
1056.675	was still alight,
1060.551	just as it is in each and every one of us.
1065.522	I know that I'm not my body.
1068.504	And I also know that you're not yours.
1072.072	And then it no longer matters
1072.072	what you look like,
1076.25	where you come from,
1076.25	or what you do for a living.
1080.657	All that matters is that we continue
1080.657	to fan the flame of humanity
1086.365	by living our lives
1086.365	as the ultimate creative expression
1090.319	of who we really are,
1093.867	because we are all connected
1096.584	by millions and millions of straws.
1101.319	And it's time to join those up
1104.116	and to hang on.
1106.161	And if we are to move
1106.161	towards our collective bliss ...
1110.415	it's time we shed our focus
1110.415	on the physical
1112.995	and instead embrace
1112.995	the virtues of the heart.
1116.381	So raise your straws if you'll join me.
1119.964	(Applause)
1121.138	Thank you.
1122.323	(Applause)
1127.394	Thank you.
1128.744	(Applause)
