12.76	There's something about caves --
16.56	a shadowy opening in a limestone
16.56	cliff that draws you in.
21.8	As you pass through the portal
21.8	between light and dark,
25.48	you enter a subterranean world --
28.04	a place of perpetual gloom,
28.04	of earthy smells, of hushed silence.
34.8	Long ago in Europe,
36.16	ancient people also entered
36.16	these underground worlds.
39.64	As witness to their passage,
41.08	they left behind mysterious
41.08	engravings and paintings,
44.759	like this panel of humans, triangles
44.759	and zigzags from Ojo Guare√±a in Spain.
52	You now walk the same path
52	as these early artists.
55.8	And in this surreal, otherworldly place,
58.84	it's almost possible to imagine
60.76	that you hear the muffled footfall
60.76	of skin boots on soft earth,
65.32	or that you see the flickering of a torch
65.32	around the next bend.
69.6	When I'm in a cave,
71	I often find myself wondering
71	what drove these people to go so deep
77.12	to brave dangerous and narrow
77.12	passageways to leave their mark?
80.84	In this video clip,
82.08	that was shot half a kilometer,
82.08	or about a third of a mile, underground,
85.48	in the cave of Cudon in Spain,
87.64	we found a series
87.64	of red paintings on a ceiling
90.12	in a previously unexplored
90.12	section of the cave.
93.08	As we crawled forward, military-style,
93.08	with the ceiling getting ever lower,
97.76	we finally got to a point
97.76	where the ceiling was so low
101	that my husband
101	and project photographer, Dylan,
103.28	could no longer achieve focus
103.28	on the ceiling with his DSLR camera.
107.44	So while he filmed me,
109.12	I kept following the trail of red paint
109.12	with a single light
112.44	and a point-and-shoot camera
112.44	that we kept for that type of occasion.
117.68	Half a kilometer underground.
120.48	Seriously.
121.84	What was somebody doing down there
121.84	with a torch or a stone lamp?
124.864	(Laughter)
126.08	I mean -- me, it makes sense, right?
128	But you know,
129.24	this is the kind of question that
129.24	I'm trying to answer with my research.
133.08	I study some of the oldest
133.08	art in the world.
136.56	It was created by these
136.56	early artists in Europe,
138.88	between 10,000 and 40,000 years ago.
143.48	And the thing is
144.72	that I'm not just studying it
144.72	because it's beautiful,
147.24	though some of it certainly is.
149.52	But what I'm interested in
149.52	is the development of the modern mind,
153.52	of the evolution of creativity,
153.52	of imagination, of abstract thought,
158.48	about what it means to be human.
163.12	While all species communicate
163.12	in one way or another,
166.32	only we humans have really
166.32	taken it to another level.
169.92	Our desire and ability
169.92	to share and collaborate
172.52	has been a huge part of our success story.
175.2	Our modern world is based on a global
175.2	network of information exchange
180.04	made possible, in large part,
180.04	by our ability to communicate --
184.08	in particular, using graphic
184.08	or written forms of communication.
188.52	The thing is, though,
189.8	that we've been building
189.8	on the mental achievements
192.36	of those that came before us for so long
195.44	that it's easy to forget that certain
195.44	abilities haven't already existed.
200.76	It's one of the things
200.76	I find most fascinating
203.16	about studying our deep history.
205.76	Those people didn't have the shoulders
205.76	of any giants to stand on.
209.88	They were the original shoulders.
212.36	And while a surprising number
212.36	of important inventions
215.28	come out of that distant time,
217.2	what I want to talk to you about today
217.2	is the invention of graphic communication.
222.68	There are three
222.68	main types of communication,
224.88	spoken, gestural --
224.88	so things like sign language --
228.28	and graphic communication.
230.6	Spoken and gestural are
230.6	by their very nature ephemeral.
234.28	It requires close contact
234.28	for a message to be sent and received.
238.24	And after the moment
238.24	of transmission, it's gone forever.
242.2	Graphic communication, on the other hand,
242.2	decouples that relationship.
246.2	And with its invention,
246.2	it became possible for the first time
250.2	for a message to be
250.2	transmitted and preserved
253.08	beyond a single moment in place and time.
256.8	Europe is one of the first places
258.6	that we start to see graphic marks
258.6	regularly appearing
261.32	in caves, rock shelters
261.32	and even a few surviving open-air sites.
266.24	But this is not the Europe we know today.
268.8	This was a world dominated
268.8	by towering ice sheets,
271.8	three to four kilometers high,
273.8	with sweeping grass plains
273.8	and frozen tundra.
277.08	This was the Ice Age.
280.08	Over the last century,
281.4	more than 350 Ice Age rock art sites
281.4	have been found across the continent,
286.72	decorated with animals, abstract shapes
286.72	and even the occasional human
291.12	like these engraved figures
291.12	from Grotta dell'Addaura in Sicily.
294.76	They provide us with a rare glimpse
296.84	into the creative world and imagination
296.84	of these early artists.
301.84	Since their discovery,
303.24	it's been the animals that have received
303.24	the majority of the study
307.2	like this black horse
307.2	from Cullalvera in Spain,
310.4	or this unusual purple bison
310.4	from La Pasiega.
314.88	But for me, it was the abstract shapes,
314.88	what we call geometric signs,
320.28	that drew me to study the art.
323.24	The funny this is that at most sites
325.56	the geometric signs far outnumber
325.56	the animal and human images.
330.08	But when I started on this back in 2007,
333.28	there wasn't even a definitive list
333.28	of how many shapes there were,
337.28	nor was there a strong sense
338.64	of whether the same ones
338.64	appeared across space or time.
344.12	Before I could even
344.12	get started on my questions,
347.24	my first step was to compile a database
349.36	of all known geometric signs
349.36	from all of the rock art sites.
353.28	The problem was that while they were
353.28	well documented at some sites,
356.88	usually the ones
356.88	with the very nice animals,
359.2	there was also a large number of them
359.2	where it was very vague --
362.88	there wasn't a lot
362.88	of description or detail.
365.16	Some of them hadn't been visited
365.16	in half a century or more.
368.52	These were the ones
368.52	that I targeted for my field work.
371.96	Over the course of two years,
373.84	my faithful husband Dylan and I
373.84	each spent over 300 hours underground,
379.08	hiking, crawling and wriggling
379.08	around 52 sites
383.08	in France, Spain, Portugal and Sicily.
386.04	And it was totally worth it.
387.92	We found new, undocumented geometric signs
387.92	at 75 percent of the sites we visited.
394.68	This is the level of accuracy
394.68	I knew I was going to need
397.52	if I wanted to start answering
397.52	those larger questions.
400.72	So let's get to those answers.
403.32	Barring a handful of outliers,
403.32	there are only 32 geometric signs.
407.96	Only 32 signs
409.8	across a 30,000-year time span
409.8	and the entire continent of Europe.
415.72	That is a very small number.
418.32	Now, if these were random
418.32	doodles or decorations,
420.8	we would expect to see
420.8	a lot more variation,
423.24	but instead what we find
423.24	are the same signs
425.68	repeating across both space and time.
428.92	Some signs start out strong,
428.92	before losing popularity and vanishing,
432.84	while other signs are later inventions.
435.2	But 65 percent of those signs stayed
435.2	in use during that entire time period --
440.84	things like lines, rectangles
440.84	triangles, ovals and circles
445.16	like we see here
445.16	from the end of the Ice Age,
447.327	at a 10,000-year-old site
447.327	high in the Pyrenees Mountains.
451.28	And while certain signs
451.28	span thousands of kilometers,
454.52	other signs had much more
454.52	restricted distribution patterns,
457.52	with some being limited
457.52	to a single territory,
459.96	like we see here
459.96	with these divided rectangles
462.16	that are only found in northern Spain,
464.4	and which some researchers have speculated
466.48	could be some sort
466.48	of family or clan signs.
469.88	On a side note,
471.28	there is surprising degree
471.28	of similarity in the earliest rock art
474.72	found all the way from France and Spain
474.72	to Indonesia and Australia.
479.32	With many of the same signs
479.32	appearing in such far-flung places,
483.64	especially in that 30,000
483.64	to 40,000-year range,
486.64	it's starting to seem increasingly likely
489.52	that this invention actually traces back
489.52	to a common point of origin in Africa.
494.4	But that I'm afraid,
494.4	is a subject for a future talk.
497.04	So back to the matter at hand.
498.88	There could be no doubt that these signs
498.88	were meaningful to their creators,
502.88	like these 25,000-year-old
502.88	bas-relief sculptures
505.72	from La Roque de Venasque in France.
508.36	We might not know what they meant,
508.36	but the people of the time certainly did.
513.76	The repetition of the same signs,
513.76	for so long, and at so many sites
519.84	tells us that the artists
519.84	were making intentional choices.
523.8	If we're talking about geometric shapes,
526.2	with specific, culturally recognized,
526.2	agreed-upon meanings,
530.96	than we could very well be looking
532.64	at one of the oldest systems
532.64	of graphic communication in the world.
537.2	I'm not talking about writing yet.
539.12	There's just not enough
539.12	characters at this point
541.48	to have represented all of the words
541.48	in the spoken language,
544.36	something which is a requirement
544.36	for a full writing system.
547.2	Nor do we see the signs
547.2	repeating regularly enough
549.6	to suggest that they were
549.6	some sort of alphabet.
552.28	But what we do have
552.28	are some intriguing one-offs,
555.12	like this panel from La Pasiega in Spain,
555.12	"known as ""The Inscription,"""
559.72	with its symmetrical markings on the left,
562.28	possible stylized representations
562.28	of hands in the middle,
565.52	and what looks a bit
565.52	like a bracket on the right.
569.08	The oldest systems of graphic
569.08	communication in the world --
571.96	Sumerian cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphs,
571.96	the earliest Chinese script,
576.92	all emerged between 4,000
576.92	and 5,000 years ago,
580.52	with each coming into existence
580.52	from an earlier protosystem
583.68	made up of counting marks
583.68	and pictographic representations,
587.24	where the meaning
587.24	and the image were the same.
589.64	So a picture of a bird would really
589.64	have represented that animal.
593.88	It's only later that we start to see
593.88	these pictographs become more stylized,
598.64	until they almost become unrecognizable
601	and that we also start to see
601	more symbols being invented
604.04	to represent all those other
604.04	missing words in language --
606.96	things like pronouns, adverbs, adjectives.
610.16	So knowing all this,
611.72	it seems highly unlikely that
611.72	the geometric signs from Ice Age Europe
615.6	were truly abstract written characters.
618.32	Instead, what's much more likely
620.56	is that these early artists
620.56	were also making counting marks,
624.56	maybe like this row of lines
624.56	from Riparo di Za Minic in Sicily,
628.6	as well as creating
628.6	stylized representations
631.24	of things from the world around them.
633.76	Could some of the signs
633.76	be weaponry or housing?
636.4	Or what about celestial objects
636.4	like star constellations?
640.56	Or maybe even rivers, mountains,
640.56	trees -- landscape features,
645.2	possibly like this black penniform
645.2	surrounded by strange bell-shaped signs
649.6	from the site of El Castillo in Spain.
652.2	The term penniform
652.2	"means ""feather-shaped"" in Latin,"
655.52	but could this actually be
655.52	a depiction of a plant or a tree?
659.72	Some researchers have begun
659.72	to ask these questions
662.72	about certain signs at specific sites,
665.64	but I believe the time has come
665.64	to revisit this category as a whole.
670.56	The irony in all of this, of course,
672.32	is that having just carefully classified
672.32	all of the signs into a single category,
676.64	I have a feeling that my next step
676.64	will involve breaking it back apart
680.16	as different types of imagery
680.16	are identified and separated off.
684.44	Now don't get me wrong,
685.68	the later creation
685.68	of fully developed writing
688.32	was an impressive feat in its own right.
690.96	But it's important to remember
692.44	that those early writing systems
692.44	didn't come out of a vacuum.
695.76	And that even 5,000 years ago,
697.76	people were already building
697.76	on something much older,
701.12	with its origins stretching back
701.12	tens of thousands of years --
704.88	to the geometric signs
704.88	of Ice Age Europe and far beyond,
709	to that point, deep
709	in our collective history,
712.32	when someone first came up with the idea
712.32	of making a graphic mark,
716.4	and forever changed the nature
716.4	of how we communicate.
719.36	Thank you.
720.6	(Applause)
