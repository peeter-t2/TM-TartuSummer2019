12.764	Hi everyone.
14.9	So, I'm going to take us back to 2007.
17.74	I'd just spent about six months
17.74	working on album
20.02	that I'd poured my heart and my soul into,
22.1	and it was getting about three plays
22.1	per day on Myspace at the time,
25.34	and I was getting more and more depressed
25.34	when I started noticing these other people
29.38	who were playing guitar and singing
31.1	and putting videos
31.1	on this new site called YouTube,
33.54	and they were getting 300,000 views.
35.3	So I decided I'm going to start
35.3	making some Youtube videos.
38.42	And one day they featured
38.42	a video of my band on the homepage,
41.66	which was amazing --
41.66	we got a bunch of new fans.
43.939	We also got a bunch of people
45.38	who, I guess, just didn't really like
45.38	the music or something --
48.38	(Laughter)
49.42	It's OK because people
49.42	started coming to our shows,
51.86	and we started touring,
53.14	and we came out with a record.
54.62	And when I checked
54.62	our bank account balance
56.7	after our first monthly iTunes payout,
58.58	we had 22,000 bucks in it,
60.1	which was amazing because at the time
60.1	I was living at my dad's house,
63.38	trying to make a living as a musician
63.38	by uploading videos to the internet
66.86	which literally zero people
66.86	respected in 2009 --
69.7	even the people who were
69.7	uploading videos to the internet.
72.46	And so for the next four years,
74.18	I uploaded more and more
74.18	videos to the Internet,
77.02	and they got better and better,
79.58	and we made enough money
79.58	through brand deals
82.78	and commercials and iTunes sales
85.34	to buy a house.
87.18	And we built a recording studio.
89.5	But there was one big problem:
91.18	making money as a creative person
91.18	in 2013 was super weird.
96.3	First of all, the business models
96.3	were changing all the time.
99.22	So our 58,000 dollars
99.22	of annual iTunes download income
103.02	was about to be replaced by about
103.02	6,000 dollars of streaming income.
106.7	Steams paid less than downloads.
108.62	And then as more and more creators
108.62	started popping up online,
111.7	there was just more competition
111.7	for these five-figure brand deals
114.82	that had kept the band afloat for years.
116.98	And to top it all off,
116.98	our videos themselves --
119.22	the creative stuff that we made
119.22	that our fans loved and appreciated --
123.06	that were actually
123.06	contributing value to the world,
125.54	those videos were generating
125.54	almost zero dollars of income for us.
128.7	This is an actual snapshot
128.7	of my YouTube dashboard
131.1	from a 28-day period
132.38	that shows one million views
134.1	and 166 dollars of ad earnings
134.1	for those views.
138.66	The whole machine in 2013
141.019	that took art online and outputted money
144.54	was totally nonfunctional.
146.86	It doesn't matter if you're a newspaper,
149.42	or an institution,
151.06	or an independent creator.
152.42	A monthly web comic
152.42	with 20,000 monthly readers --
158.06	gets paid a couple hundred
158.06	bucks in ad revenue.
160.42	This is 20,000 people.
163.9	Like, in what world is this not enough?
167.14	I don't understand.
169.1	What systems have we built
169.1	where this is insufficient
172.74	for a person to make a living?
174.78	So, I actually have a theory about this.
176.74	I think it's been a weird 100 years.
178.5	(Laughter)
179.74	(Applause)
181.82	About 100 years ago,
183.74	humans figured out how to record
183.74	sound onto a wax cylinder.
187.34	That was the beginning of the phonograph.
189.34	Right around the same time,
190.7	we figured out how to record
190.7	light onto a piece of photographic paper,
194.02	celluloid -- the beginning
194.02	of film and television.
196.42	For the first time,
196.42	you could store art on a thing,
199.14	which was amazing.
200.42	Art used to be completely ephemeral,
202.18	so if you missed the symphony,
202.18	you just didn't get to hear the orchestra.
205.66	But now, for the first time,
207.1	you could store the orchestra's
207.1	performance on a physical object,
211.7	and like, listen to it later,
213.22	which was amazing.
214.98	It was so amazing in fact,
216.26	that for the next 100 years,
216.26	between 1900 and 2000,
219.58	humans built just billions and billions
219.58	of dollars of infrastructure
224.1	to essentially help artists do two things.
226.38	First, put their art on a thing,
228.46	and second, get that thing
228.46	around the world
230.7	to the people who wanted the art.
232.34	So, so much industry
232.34	is devoted to these two problems.
235.18	Oh my gosh, there are trucking companies,
237.157	and brick-and-mortar and marketing firms,
237.157	and CD jewel case manufacturers,
241.86	all devoted to these two problems.
244.66	And then we all know what happened.
248.7	and we get Spotify
248.7	and Facebook and YouTube
250.78	and iTunes and Google search,
252.62	and a hundred years of infrastructure
255.7	and supply chains and distribution systems
258.3	and monetization schemes
260.14	are completely bypassed --
262.06	in a decade.
264.22	After 100 years of designing these things,
267.22	it's no wonder that it's just totally
267.22	broken for creative people right now.
271.14	It's no wonder that the monetization
271.14	part of the chain doesn't work
274.78	given this new context.
277.34	But what gets me super excited
277.34	to be a creator right now,
282.02	to be alive today and be
282.02	a creative person right now,
284.98	is realizing that we're only 10 years
284.98	into figuring out this new machine --
291.18	to figuring out the next 100 years
291.18	of infrastructure for our creators.
295.22	And you can tell we're only 10 years in.
297.18	There's a lot of trial and error,
297.18	some really good ideas forming,
300.3	a lot of experimentation.
301.58	We're figuring out
301.58	what works and what doesn't.
303.82	Like Twitch streamers.
303.82	Who's heard of Twitch?
305.98	Twitch streamers are making
305.98	three to five thousand bucks a month
309.42	streaming gaming content.
310.7	The big ones are making
310.7	over 100,000 dollars a year.
315.1	There's a site called YouNow,
316.82	it's an app.
318.06	It allows musicians and vloggers
318.06	to get paid in digital goods from fans.
322.86	So, I'm also working on the problem.
324.62	Four years ago I started
324.62	a company called Patreon
326.98	with a friend of mine.
328.26	We're 80 people now
328.26	working on this problem.
331.26	It's basically a membership platform
333.54	that makes it really easy
333.54	for creators to get paid --
336.78	every month from their fans
336.78	to earn a living.
339.02	For a creator, it's like having a salary
339.02	for being a creative person.
343.3	And this is one of our creators.
344.9	"They're called ""Kinda Funny."""
346.34	They have about 220,000
346.34	subscribers on YouTube.
349.62	And when they upload a video,
351.06	it gets somewhere around
353.86	I want you to check yourselves right now.
355.86	I think when we hear numbers like that,
355.86	"when we hear ""15,000 views,"""
359.1	and we see content like this,
360.54	we just snap categorize it
360.54	as being not as legitimate
363.74	as a morning show
363.74	that you'd hear on the radio
366.74	or a talk show that you'd
366.74	see on NBC or something
369.14	"But when ""Kinda Funny"""
369.14	launched on Patreon,
371.3	within a few weeks, they were
371.3	making 31,000 dollars per month
375.58	for this show.
377.1	It took off so fast that they decided
377.1	to expand their programming
380.22	and add new shows,
381.5	and now they launched
381.5	a second Patreon page --
384.18	they're making an additional
388.62	And they're scaling what's essentially
388.62	becoming a media company,
393.62	financing the whole thing
393.62	through membership.
396.22	OK, here's another example.
397.98	This is Derek Bodner,
399.34	a sports journalist who used
399.34	to write for Philadelphia Magazine
402.34	until a few months ago when
402.34	the magazine cut out all sports coverage.
405.62	Now he writes articles
405.62	and publishes them on his own website --
408.62	he's still covering sports,
408.62	but for himself.
410.74	And he's making 4,800 bucks
410.74	a month from 1,700 patrons,
413.62	financing it through membership.
415.62	This is Crash Course --
416.9	free educational content for the world.
419.46	This show is actually
419.46	on the PBS digital network --
423.22	This is a duo sailing around the world,
425.46	getting paid every month
425.46	for documenting their travels
428.06	from 1,400 patrons.
429.58	This is a podcast,
429.58	"""Chapo Trap House"", making --"
432.14	actually, since I screenshotted this,
434.02	they're making an additional
434.02	2,000 dollars per month,
436.54	so they're now making 56,000 dollars
436.54	per month for their podcast.
441.02	And Patreon's not the only one
441.02	working on the problem.
443.62	Even Google's starting to work on this.
445.54	A couple years ago,
445.54	they launched Fan Funding;
447.74	more recently, they launched Super Chat
449.66	as a way for creators
449.66	to monetize live streaming.
452.06	Newspapers are starting
452.06	to experiment with membership.
454.66	New York Times has a membership program;
456.62	The Guardian has over 200,000
456.62	paying subscribers
458.9	to its membership program.
460.54	There's this bubbling soup
460.54	of ideas and experiments
465.14	and progress right now,
466.66	and it's pointing in the direction
466.66	of getting creators paid.
470.14	And it's working.
471.62	It's not, like, perfect yet,
473.22	but it's really working.
474.7	So, Patreon has over 50,000 creators
474.7	on the platform making salaries --
479.58	getting paid every month
479.58	for putting art online,
482.66	for being a creative person.
485.02	The next hundred years
485.02	of infrastructure is on the way
489.5	and it's going to be different
489.5	this time because of this --
492.3	because of the direct connection
492.3	between the person who makes the thing
495.7	and the person who likes the thing.
499.14	About seven or eight years ago,
501.42	I went to a cocktail party.
504.66	This is when the band
504.66	had hit our first machine,
506.94	so things were really cranking.
508.46	We had just made
508.46	about 400,000 dollars in one year
510.86	through iTunes sales
510.86	and brand deals and stuff like that.
513.58	And this guy comes up to me and says,
516.38	"""Hey, Jack, what do you do?"""
517.74	"I said, ""I'm a musician."""
519.86	And he just sobered up immediately,
523.22	and he stuck out his hand,
525.26	put a hand on my shoulder,
526.54	and in a real earnest,
526.54	very nice voice he was like,
530.3	"""I hope you make it someday."""
531.705	(Laughter)
534.7	And ...
537.06	I have so many moments like that
537.06	logged in my memory.
541.14	I just cringe thinking of that.
544.02	It's so embarrassing to just
544.02	not feel valued as a creative person.
550.98	But as a species,
552.58	we are leaving that cocktail party behind.
555.02	We're leaving that culture,
557.18	we're out of there.
559.02	We're going to get so good
559.02	at paying creators,
561.74	within 10 years,
564.02	kids graduating high school and college
564.02	are going to think of being a creator
567.82	as just being an option --
569.1	I could be a doctor, I could be a lawyer,
571.077	I could be a podcaster,
571.077	I could have a web comic.
573.42	It's just going to be
573.42	something you can do.
575.5	We're figuring it out.
577.26	It's going to be a viable and sustainable
577.26	and respected profession.
581.58	Creators are going to come out
581.58	the other end of this weird 100 years,
584.86	this century-long journey,
587.5	with an awesome new machine.
589.66	And they're going to be paid,
589.66	and they're going to be valued.
593.58	Thanks, everybody.
594.82	(Applause)
600.18	I think it went pretty well.
603.22	I want artists who saw that
603.22	to not give up --
606.98	to know that we're getting there.
610.54	It's not there yet,
613.18	but in a couple years,
615.1	there will be so many systems
615.1	and tools for them
617.42	to just make a living online,
619.42	and if they've got a podcast
619.42	that's starting to take off,
622.74	but they're not able
622.74	to make money on it yet,
624.9	that's happening
626.14	and they're going to be paid.
627.58	It's happening.
