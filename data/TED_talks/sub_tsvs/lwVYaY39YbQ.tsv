12.892	I want to tell you a story about a girl.
16.335	But I can't tell you her real name.
18.835	So let's just call her Hadiza.
21.381	Hadiza is 20.
23.459	She's shy,
24.634	but she has a beautiful smile
24.634	that lights up her face.
28.779	But she's in constant pain.
32.463	And she will likely be on medication
32.463	for the rest of her life.
36.866	Do you want to know why?
39.784	Hadiza is a Chibok girl,
42.665	and on April 14, 2014, she was kidnapped
45.922	by Boko Haram terrorists.
48.29	She managed to escape, though,
50.823	by jumping off the truck
50.823	that was carrying the girls.
54.044	But when she landed,
54.044	she broke both her legs,
57.361	and she had to crawl on her tummy
57.361	to hide in the bushes.
60.805	She told me she was terrified
60.805	that Boko Haram would come back for her.
65.524	She was one of 57 girls who would escape
65.524	by jumping off trucks that day.
70.175	This story, quite rightly, caused ripples
72.74	around the world.
74.136	People like Michelle Obama,
74.136	Malala and others
77.43	lent their voices in protest,
79.546	and at about the same time --
79.546	I was living in London at the time --
82.831	I was sent from London to Abuja
82.831	to cover the World Economic Forum
87.498	that Nigeria was hosting
87.498	for the first time.
90.475	But when we arrived, it was clear
90.475	that there was only one story in town.
95.729	We put the government under pressure.
97.598	We asked tough questions
97.598	about what they were doing
100.184	to bring these girls back.
102.199	Understandably,
103.947	they weren't too happy
103.947	with our line of questioning,
106.778	and let's just say we received
106.778	"our fair share of ""alternative facts."""
110.551	(Laughter)
113.256	Influential Nigerians
113.256	were telling us at the time
116.478	that we were na√Øve,
118.499	we didn't understand
118.499	the political situation in Nigeria.
122.72	But they also told us
124.839	that the story of the Chibok girls
127.471	was a hoax.
130.085	Sadly, this hoax narrative has persisted,
132.809	and there are still people
132.809	in Nigeria today
135.123	who believe that the Chibok girls
135.123	were never kidnapped.
138.751	Yet I was talking to people like these --
142.221	devastated parents,
143.95	who told us that on the day
143.95	Boko Haram kidnapped their daughters,
148.028	they ran into the Sambisa Forest
148.028	after the trucks carrying their daughters.
152.626	They were armed with machetes,
152.626	but they were forced to turn back
156.378	because Boko Haram had guns.
159.165	For two years, inevitably,
159.165	the news agenda moved on,
162.852	and for two years,
164.606	we didn't hear much
164.606	about the Chibok girls.
167.789	Everyone presumed they were dead.
170.053	But in April last year,
172.064	I was able to obtain this video.
174.856	This is a still from the video
176.62	that Boko Haram filmed as a proof of life,
180.743	and through a source,
180.743	I obtained this video.
183.929	But before I could publish it,
185.49	I had to travel
185.49	to the northeast of Nigeria
188.539	to talk to the parents, to verify it.
191.137	I didn't have to wait
191.137	too long for confirmation.
195.45	One of the mothers,
195.45	when she watched the video, told me
198.804	that if she could have reached
198.804	into the laptop
201.528	and pulled our her child from the laptop,
205.571	she would have done so.
208.023	For those of you who are parents,
208.023	like myself, in the audience,
211.269	you can only imagine the anguish
214.121	that that mother felt.
217.421	This video would go on to kick-start
217.421	negotiation talks with Boko Haram.
223.999	And a Nigerian senator told me
223.999	that because of this video
227.991	they entered into those talks,
230.008	because they had long presumed
230.008	that the Chibok girls were dead.
234.459	Twenty-one girls were freed
234.459	in October last year.
239.185	Sadly, nearly 200 of them
239.185	still remain missing.
243.511	I must confess that I have not been
243.511	a dispassionate observer
247.732	covering this story.
248.942	I am furious when I think
248.942	about the wasted opportunities
254.052	to rescue these girls.
255.265	I am furious when I think about
255.265	what the parents have told me,
259.189	that if these were daughters
259.189	of the rich and the powerful,
261.987	they would have been found much earlier.
266.101	And I am furious
268.133	that the hoax narrative,
270.085	I firmly believe,
271.987	caused a delay;
274.123	it was part of the reason
274.123	for the delay in their return.
278.5	This illustrates to me
278.5	the deadly danger of fake news.
283.039	So what can we do about it?
285.703	There are some very smart people,
287.644	smart engineers at Google and Facebook,
290.127	who are trying to use technology
290.127	to stop the spread of fake news.
295.216	But beyond that, I think
295.216	everybody here -- you and I --
299.991	we have a role to play in that.
302.202	We are the ones who share the content.
304.519	We are the ones who share
304.519	the stories online.
307.054	In this day and age, we're all publishers,
310.355	and we have responsibility.
312.87	In my job as a journalist,
315.204	I check, I verify.
317.256	I trust my gut, but I ask tough questions.
321.44	Why is this person telling me this story?
324.34	What do they have to gain
324.34	by sharing this information?
327.863	Do they have a hidden agenda?
330.502	I really believe that we must all start
330.502	to ask tougher questions
336.017	of information that we discover online.
341.493	Research shows that some of us
341.493	don't even read beyond headlines
347.248	before we share stories.
349.375	Who here has done that?
351.764	I know I have.
354.255	But what if
357.115	we stopped taking information
357.115	that we discover at face value?
362.07	What if we stop to think
362.07	about the consequence
365.667	of the information that we pass on
368.14	and its potential to incite
368.14	violence or hatred?
372.415	What if we stop to think
372.415	about the real-life consequences
376.974	of the information that we share?
379.925	Thank you very much for listening.
381.749	(Applause)
