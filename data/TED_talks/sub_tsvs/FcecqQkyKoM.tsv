16.837	I'd like to share with you
18.833	the story of one of my patients called Celine.
22.67	Celine is a housewife and lives in a rural district
25.823	of Cameroon in west Central Africa.
28.895	Six years ago, at the time of her HIV diagnosis,
32.582	she was recruited to participate in the clinical trial
35.583	which was running in her health district at the time.
38.654	When I first met Celine, a little over a year ago,
42.358	she had gone for 18 months
44.042	without any antiretroviral therapy,
46.329	and she was very ill.
49.066	She told me that she stopped coming to the clinic
51.464	when the trial ended
53.015	because she had no money for the bus fare
55.726	and was too ill to walk the 35-kilometer distance.
59.454	Now during the clinical trial,
61.198	she'd been given all her antiretroviral drugs free of charge,
65.583	and her transportation costs
67.614	had been covered by the research funds.
70.221	All of these ended once the trial was completed,
73.575	leaving Celine with no alternatives.
76.567	She was unable to tell me the names of the drugs
79.243	she'd received during the trial,
81.27	or even what the trial had been about.
84.027	I didn't bother to ask her what the results of the trial were
87.576	because it seemed obvious to me that she would have no clue.
91.983	Yet what puzzled me most
94.252	was Celine had given her informed consent
97.359	to be a part of this trial, yet she clearly did not understand
101.191	the implications of being a participant
103.661	or what would happen to her once the trial had been completed.
108.07	Now, I have shared this story with you as an example
111.465	of what can happen to participants in the clinical trial
114.394	when it is poorly conducted.
116.853	Maybe this particular trial yielded exciting results.
120.718	Maybe it even got published in a high-profile scientific journal.
124.407	Maybe it would inform clinicians around the world
127.214	on how to improve on the clinical management of HIV patients.
132.749	But it would have done so at a price
135.535	to hundreds of patients who, like Celine,
138.482	were left to their own devices
140.726	once the research had been completed.
143.797	I do not stand here today to suggest in any way
147.135	that conducting HIV clinical trials
149.148	in developing countries is bad.
151.363	On the contrary, clinical trials are extremely useful tools,
155.73	and are much needed to address the burden
158.028	of disease in developing countries.
160.499	However, the inequalities that exist between
163.358	richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding
167.06	pose a real risk for exploitation,
170.217	especially in the context of externally-funded research.
174.102	Sadly enough, the fact remains that
176.708	a lot of the studies that are conducted in developing countries
180.692	could never be authorized in the richer countries
183.268	which fund the research.
185.516	I'm sure you must be asking yourselves
187.763	what makes developing countries,
189.679	especially those in sub-Saharan Africa,
192.223	so attractive for these HIV clinical trials?
195.79	Well, in order for a clinical trial to generate
199.062	valid and widely applicable results,
202.178	they need to be conducted with large numbers of study participants
206.178	and preferably on a population
208.821	with a high incidence of new HIV infections.
212.602	Sub-Saharan Africa largely fits this description,
216.073	with 22 million people living with HIV,
219.275	an estimated 70 percent of the 30 million people
222.915	who are infected worldwide.
225.396	Also, research within the continent
227.826	is a lot easier to conduct due to widespread poverty,
231.938	endemic diseases and inadequate health care systems.
235.789	A clinical trial that is considered to be
238.578	potentially beneficial to the population
241.328	is more likely to be authorized,
243.635	and in the absence of good health care systems,
246.435	almost any offer of medical assistance
249.389	is accepted as better than nothing.
252.307	Even more problematic reasons include
254.893	lower risk of litigation,
257.18	less rigorous ethical reviews,
259.647	and populations that are willing to participate
262.203	in almost any study that hints at a cure.
266.867	As funding for HIV research
270.492	increases in developing countries
272.748	and ethical review in richer countries become more strict,
276.755	you can see why this context becomes
278.84	very, very attractive.
281.401	The high prevalence of HIV drives researchers
285.081	to conduct research that is sometimes scientifically acceptable
289.565	but on many levels ethically questionable.
292.844	How then can we ensure that, in our search for the cure,
296.283	we do not take an unfair advantage
298.603	of those who are already most affected by the pandemic?
302.107	I invite you to consider four areas I think we can focus on
305.963	in order to improve the way in which things are done.
309.538	The first of these is informed consent.
312.365	Now, in order for a clinical trial to be
314.733	considered ethically acceptable,
318.414	participants must be given the relevant information
321.238	in a way in which they can understand,
323.673	and must freely consent to participate in the trial.
327.89	This is especially important in developing countries,
330.568	where a lot of participants consent to research
333.47	because they believe it is the only way in which
336.158	they can receive medical care or other benefits.
339.728	Consent procedures that are used in richer countries
342.695	are often inappropriate or ineffective
345.497	in a lot of developing countries.
347.85	For example, it is counterintuitive to have
350.823	an illiterate study participant, like Celine,
353.822	sign a lengthy consent form that they are unable to read,
357.149	let alone understand.
359.256	Local communities need to be more involved
362.336	in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants
365.609	in clinical trials, as well as the incentives for participation.
370.31	The information in these trials
372.126	needs to be given to the potential participants
375.077	in linguistically and culturally acceptable formats.
379.505	The second point I would like for you to consider
382.326	is the standard of care that is provided
384.764	to participants within any clinical trial.
387.71	Now, this is subject to a lot of debate and controversy.
391.407	Should the control group in the clinical trial
394.388	be given the best current treatment which is available
397.661	anywhere in the world?
399.741	Or should they be given an alternative standard of care,
402.709	such as the best current treatment available
405.597	in the country in which the research is being conducted?
408.909	Is it fair to evaluate a treatment regimen
412.249	which may not be affordable or accessible
415.325	to the study participants once the research has been completed?
419.295	Now, in a situation where the best current treatment
423.036	is inexpensive and simple to deliver,
425.675	the answer is straightforward.
427.703	However, the best current treatment available
430.853	anywhere in the world is often very difficult
433.74	to provide in developing countries.
436.427	It is important to assess the potential risks and benefits
439.979	of the standard of care which is to be provided
442.756	to participants in any clinical trial,
445.237	and establish one which is relevant for the context of the study
450.685	and most beneficial for the participants within the study.
454.182	That brings us to the third point I want you think about:
457.433	the ethical review of research.
460.284	An effective system for reviewing the ethical suitability
464.083	of clinical trials is primordial to safeguard participants
468.211	within any clinical trial.
470.324	Unfortunately, this is often lacking
473.236	or inefficient in a lot of developing countries.
476.764	Local governments need to set up effective systems
481.127	for reviewing the ethical issues around the clinical trials
484.004	which are authorized in different developing countries,
487.921	and they need to do this by setting up
490.195	ethical review committees that are independent
492.705	of the government and research sponsors.
496.09	Public accountability needs to be promoted
498.5	through transparency and independent review
501.733	by nongovernmental and international organizations
504.772	as appropriate.
506.343	The final point I would like for you to consider tonight
509.853	is what happens to participants in the clinical trial
513.076	once the research has been completed.
515.851	I think it is absolutely wrong for research to begin
519.325	in the first place without a clear plan
521.837	for what would happen to the participants
523.916	once the trial has ended.
526.356	Now, researchers need to make every effort to ensure that
531.484	an intervention that has been shown to be beneficial
534.468	during a clinical trial
536.2	is accessible to the participants of the trial
539.812	once the trial has been completed.
542.36	In addition, they should be able to consider the possibility
545.884	of introducing and maintaining effective treatments
549.485	in the wider community once the trial ends.
553.326	If, for any reason, they feel that this might not be possible,
556.749	then I think they should have to ethically justify
559.716	why the clinical trial should be conducted in the first place.
563.743	Now, fortunately for Celine,
566.059	our meeting did not end in my office.
568.734	I was able to get her enrolled into a free HIV treatment program
573.108	closer to her home,
574.496	and with a support group to help her cope.
578.27	Her story has a positive ending,
580.604	but there are thousands of others in similar situations
584.307	who are much less fortunate.
586.604	Although she may not know this,
589.028	my encounter with Celine has completely changed the way
592.893	in which I view HIV clinical trials in developing countries,
597.164	and made me even more determined to be part of the movement
600.884	to change the way in which things are done.
603.741	I believe that every single person
606.109	listening to me tonight can be part of that change.
610.484	If you are a researcher, I hold you
613.081	to a higher standard of moral conscience,
615.651	to remain ethical in your research,
618.078	and not compromise human welfare in your search for answers.
621.566	If you work for a funding agency or pharmaceutical company,
625.244	I challenge you to hold your employers
628.274	to fund research that is ethically sound.
631.449	If you come from a developing country like myself,
634.635	I urge you to hold your government
637.707	to a more thorough review of the clinical trials
640.323	which are authorized in your country.
643.236	Yes, there is a need for us to find a cure for HIV,
646.904	to find an effective vaccine for malaria,
649.556	to find a diagnostic tool that works for T.B.,
653.398	but I believe that we owe it to those who willingly
656.973	and selflessly consent to participate in these clinical trials
661.028	to do this in a humane way.
663.254	Thank you.
