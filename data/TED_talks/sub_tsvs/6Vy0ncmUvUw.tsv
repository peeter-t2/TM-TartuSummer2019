18.33	What I want to do today is to spend
20.33	some time talking about some stuff that's
22.33	sort of giving me a little bit of
24.33	existential angst, for lack of a better word,
27.33	over the past couple of years, and
29.33	basically, these three quotes
32.33	tell what's going on.
34.33	"""When God made the color purple,"
36.33	"God was just showing off,"" Alice Walker"
38.33	"wrote in ""The Color Purple,"" and"
40.33	Zora Neale Hurston wrote in
42.33	"""Dust Tracks On A Road,"""
44.33	"""Research is a formalized curiosity."
46.33	"It's poking and prying with a purpose."""
48.33	And then finally,
50.33	when I think about the near future,
52.33	you know, we have this attitude, well,
54.33	whatever happens, happens. Right?
56.33	So that goes along with the Chesire Cat
58.33	"saying, ""If you don't care much"
60.33	where you want to get to,
62.33	"it doesn't much matter which way you go."""
64.33	But I think it does matter
66.33	which way we go, and what road we take,
68.33	because when I think about design in the
70.33	near future, what I think are the most
72.33	important issues, what's really
74.33	crucial and vital is that we need
76.33	to revitalize the arts and sciences
78.33	right now in 2002.
81.33	(Applause)
86.33	If we describe the near future
88.33	as 10, 20, 15 years from now,
90.33	that means that what we do today
93.33	is going to be critically important,
95.33	because in the year 2015,
97.33	and the year 2020, 2025, the world
99.33	our society is going to be building on,
101.33	the basic knowledge and abstract ideas,
103.33	the discoveries that we came up with today,
106.33	just as all these wonderful things we're
108.33	hearing about here at the TED conference
110.33	that we take for granted in the world
112.33	right now, were really knowledge
114.33	and ideas that came up
116.33	in the '50s, the '60s, and the '70s.
119.33	That's the substrate that we're exploiting
122.33	today, whether it's the internet,
124.33	genetic engineering, laser scanners,
126.33	guided missiles, fiber optics, high-definition
128.33	television, sensing, remote-sensing
130.33	from space and the wonderful
132.33	remote-sensing photos that we see in
134.33	3D weaving, TV programs like Tracker,
137.33	and Enterprise, CD rewrite drives,
139.33	flatscreen, Alvin Ailey's Suite Otis,
142.33	"or Sarah Jones' ""Your Revolution Will Not"
145.33	"Be Between These Thighs,"" which"
147.33	by the way was banned by the FCC,
149.33	or ska, all of these things
151.33	without question, almost without exception,
153.33	are really based on ideas
155.33	and abstract and creativity
157.33	from years before,
159.33	so we have to ask ourselves,
161.33	what are we contributing to that legacy
163.33	right now? And when I think about it,
165.33	I'm really worried. To be quite frank,
167.33	I'm concerned. I'm skeptical
169.33	that we're doing very much of anything.
172.33	We're, in a sense, failing to act
174.33	in the future. We're purposefully,
177.33	consciously being laggards.
179.33	We're lagging behind.
181.33	Frantz Fanon, who was a psychiatrist
183.33	"from Martinique, said, ""Each generation"
185.33	must, out of relative obscurity,
187.33	"discover its mission, and fulfill or betray it."""
192.33	What is our mission? What do we have
194.33	to do? I think our mission is
196.33	to reconcile, to reintegrate
198.33	science and the arts, because right now
201.33	there's a schism that exists
204.33	in popular culture. You know,
206.33	people have this idea that science
208.33	and the arts are really separate.
210.33	We think of them as separate
212.33	and different things, and this idea was
214.33	probably introduced centuries ago,
216.33	but it's really becoming critical now,
218.33	because we're making decisions about our
220.33	society every day that,
223.33	if we keep thinking that the arts
225.33	are separate from the sciences,
227.33	and we keep thinking it's cute to say,
229.33	"""I don't understand anything about this one,"
231.33	I don't understand anything about the other
233.33	"one,"" then we're going to have problems."
235.33	Now I know no one here at TED
237.33	thinks this. All of us, we already know
239.33	that they're very connected, but I'm going
241.33	to let you know that some folks
243.33	in the outside world, believe it or not,
245.33	they think it's neat when they say,
247.33	"""You know, scientists and science is not"
249.33	creative. Maybe scientists are ingenious,
251.33	but they're not creative.
253.33	And then we have this tendency, the career
255.33	counselors and various people say things
257.33	"like, ""Artists are not analytical."
259.33	They're ingenious, perhaps,
262.33	"but not analytical,"" and"
265.33	when these concepts underly our teaching
267.33	and what we think about the world,
269.33	then we have a problem, because we
271.33	stymie support for everything.
273.33	By accepting this dichotomy,
275.33	whether it's tongue-in-cheek, when
277.33	we attempt to accommodate it in our world,
279.33	and we try to build our foundation
281.33	for the world, we're messing up the future,
283.33	because, who wants to be uncreative?
285.33	Who wants to be illogical?
287.33	Talent would run from either of these fields
289.33	if you said you had to choose either.
291.33	Then they're going to go to something
293.33	"where they think, ""Well, I can be creative"
295.33	"and logical at the same time."""
297.33	Now I grew up in the '60s and I'll admit it,
299.33	actually, my childhood spanned the '60s,
302.33	and I was a wannabe hippie and I always
304.33	resented the fact that I wasn't really
306.33	old enough to be a hippie.
308.33	And I know there are people here, the
310.33	younger generation who want to be hippies,
312.33	but people talk about the '60s all the time,
314.33	and they talk about the anarchy
316.33	that was there, but when I think about
318.33	the '60s, what I took away from it was
320.33	that there was hope for the future.
322.33	We thought everyone could participate.
324.33	There were wonderful, incredible ideas
326.33	that were always percolating,
328.33	and so much of what's cool or hot today
331.33	is really based on some of those concepts,
333.33	whether it's, you know, people trying to
335.33	use the prime directive from Star Trek
337.33	being involved in things, or again that
339.33	three-dimensional weaving and
341.33	fax machines that I read about in my
343.33	weekly readers that the technology
345.33	and engineering was just getting started.
347.33	But the '60s left me with a problem.
349.33	You see, I always assumed I would go
351.33	into space, because I followed all of this,
354.33	but I also loved the arts and sciences.
357.33	You see, when I was growing up as
359.33	a little girl and as a teenager,
361.33	I loved designing and making dogs' clothes
363.33	and wanting to be a fashion designer.
365.33	I took art and ceramics. I loved dance.
368.33	Lola Falana. Alvin Ailey. Jerome Robbins.
372.33	And I also avidly followed the Gemini
374.33	and the Apollo programs.
377.33	I had science projects and tons of astronomy
379.33	books. I took calculus and philosophy.
381.33	I wondered about the infinity
383.33	and the Big Bang theory.
385.33	And when I was at Stanford,
387.33	I found myself, my senior year,
389.33	chemical engineering major, half the folks
391.33	thought I was a political science and
393.33	performing arts major, which was sort of
395.33	true because I was Black Student Union President
397.33	and I did major in some other things,
399.33	and I found myself the last quarter juggling
401.33	chemical engineering separation processes,
403.33	logic classes, nuclear magnetic resonance
405.33	spectroscopy, and also producing
407.33	and choreographing a dance production,
409.33	and I had to do the lighting and the
411.33	design work, and I was trying to figure out,
414.33	do I go to New York City
416.33	to try to become a professional dancer,
418.33	or do I go to medical school?
421.33	Now, my mother helped me figure
423.33	that one out. (Laughter)
426.33	But when I went into space,
428.33	when I went into space I carried a number
430.33	of things up with me. I carried a poster
432.33	by Alvin Ailey, which you can figure out
434.33	now, I love the dance company.
436.33	An Alvin Ailey poster of Judith Jamison
438.33	"performing the dance ""Cry,"" dedicated to all"
440.33	black women everywhere. A Bundu statue,
442.33	which was from the Women's Society
444.33	in Sierra Leone, and a certificate for the
446.33	Chicago Public School students to work to
448.33	improve their science and math,
450.33	and folks asked me,
452.33	"""Why did you take up what you took up?"""
454.33	And I had to say,
456.33	"""Because it represents human creativity,"
458.33	the creativity that allowed us, that we were
460.33	required to have to conceive and build
462.33	and launch the space shuttle, springs from
465.33	the same source as the imagination and
467.33	analysis it took to carve a Bundu statue,
470.33	or the ingenuity it took to design,
473.33	"choreograph, and stage ""Cry."""
476.33	Each one of them are different
478.33	manifestations, incarnations, of creativity,
481.33	avatars of human creativity,
484.33	and that's what we have to reconcile
486.33	in our minds, how these things fit together.
488.33	The difference between arts and sciences
490.33	is not analytical versus intuitive, right?
493.33	E=MC squared required
496.33	an intuitive leap, and then you had
498.33	to do the analysis afterwards.
500.33	"Einstein said, in fact, ""The most beautiful"
502.33	thing we can experience is the mysterious.
505.33	"It is the source of all true art and science."""
508.33	Dance requires us to express and want
510.33	to express the jubilation in life, but then you
512.33	have to figure out, exactly
514.33	what movement do I do to make sure
516.33	that it comes across correctly?
518.33	The difference between arts and sciences
520.33	is also not constructive versus
522.33	deconstructive, right? A lot of people
524.33	think of the sciences as deconstructive.
526.33	You have to pull things apart.
528.33	And yeah, sub-atomic physics
530.33	is deconstructive. You literally try to
532.33	tear atoms apart to understand
534.33	what's inside of them. But sculpture, from
536.33	what I understand from great sculptors,
538.33	is deconstructive, because you see a piece
540.33	and you remove what doesn't
542.33	need to be there.
544.33	Biotechnology is constructive.
546.33	Orchestral arranging is constructive.
548.33	So in fact we use constructive and
550.33	deconstructive techniques in everything.
552.33	The difference between science
555.33	and the arts is not that they
558.33	are different sides of the same coin, even,
560.33	or even different parts
562.33	of the same continuum, but rather
564.33	they're manifestations of the same thing.
567.33	Different quantum states of an atom?
569.33	Or maybe if I want to be more 21st century
571.33	I could say that they are different harmonic
573.33	resonances of a superstring.
575.33	But we'll leave that alone. (Laughter)
577.33	They spring from the same source.
579.33	The arts and sciences are avatars of
581.33	human creativity. It's our attempt
583.33	as humans to build an understanding
585.33	of the universe, the world around us.
587.33	It's our attempt to influence things,
589.33	the universe internal to ourselves
591.33	and external to us.
593.33	The sciences, to me, are manifestations
595.33	of our attempt to express
598.33	or share our understanding,
600.33	our experience, to influence the universe
602.33	external to ourselves.
605.33	It doesn't rely on us as individuals.
607.33	It's the universe, as experienced
609.33	by everyone, and the arts manifest
611.33	our desire, our attempt to share
614.33	or influence others through experiences
617.33	that are peculiar to us as individuals.
619.33	Let me say it again another way:
621.33	science provides an understanding
623.33	of a universal experience, and
626.33	arts provides a universal understanding
629.33	of a personal experience.
632.33	That's what we have to think about,
634.33	that they're all part of us, they're
636.33	all part of a continuum.
638.33	It's not just the tools, it's not just
640.33	the sciences, you know, the mathematics
642.33	and the numerical stuff and the statistics,
644.33	because we heard, very much on this
646.33	stage, people talked about music
648.33	being mathematical. Right? Arts don't just
650.33	use clay, aren't the only ones that use clay,
652.33	light and sound and movement.
655.33	They use analysis as well.
658.33	So people might say, well,
660.33	I still like that intuitive versus analytical
662.33	thing, because everybody wants to do the
664.33	right brain, left brain thing, right?
666.33	We've all been accused of being
668.33	right-brained or left-brained at some point
670.33	in time, depending on who
672.33	we disagreed with. (Laughter)
674.33	You know, people say intuitive, you know
676.33	that's like you're in touch with nature,
678.33	in touch with yourself and relationships.
680.33	Analytical: you put your mind to work, and
682.33	I'm going to tell you a little secret. You all
684.33	know this though, but sometimes people
686.33	use this analysis idea, that things are
688.33	outside of ourselves, to be, say, that this
690.33	is what we're going to elevate
692.33	as the true, most important sciences, right?
695.33	And then you have artists, and you all
697.33	know this is true as well,
699.33	artists will say things about scientists
702.33	because they say they're too concrete,
704.33	they're disconnected with the world.
707.33	But, we've even had that here on stage,
709.33	so don't act like you don't know
711.33	what I'm talking about. (Laughter)
713.33	We had folks talking about the Flat Earth
715.33	Society and flower arrangers, so there's
717.33	this whole dichotomy that we continue
719.33	to carry along, even when we know better.
722.33	And folks say we need to choose either or.
725.33	But it would really be foolish to choose
727.33	either one, right?
729.33	Intuitive versus analytical?
731.33	That's a foolish choice. It's foolish,
733.33	just like trying to choose between
735.33	being realistic or idealistic.
737.33	You need both in life. Why do people
739.33	do this? I'm just gonna quote
741.33	a molecular biologist, Sydney Brenner,
743.33	who's 70 years old so he can say this. He said,
745.33	"""It's always important to distinguish"
747.33	"between chastity and impotence."""
749.33	Now... (Laughter)
752.33	I want to share with you
755.33	a little equation, okay?
758.33	How do understanding science
761.33	and the arts fit into our lives
763.33	and what's going on and the things
765.33	that we're talking about here
767.33	at the design conference, and this is
769.33	a little thing I came up with, understanding
771.33	and our resources and our will
773.33	cause us to have outcomes.
775.33	Our understanding is our science, our arts,
777.33	our religion, how we see the universe
779.33	around us, our resources, our money,
781.33	our labor, our minerals, those things
783.33	that are out there in the world we have
785.33	to work with.
787.33	But more importantly, there's our will.
789.33	This is our vision, our aspirations
791.33	of the future, our hopes, our dreams,
793.33	our struggles and our fears.
795.33	Our successes and our failures influence
797.33	what we do with all of those, and to me,
799.33	design and engineering, craftsmanship and
801.33	skilled labor, are all the things that work on
803.33	this to have our outcome,
805.33	which is our human quality of life.
808.33	Where do we want the world to be?
810.33	And guess what?
812.33	Regardless of how we look at this, whether
814.33	we look at arts and sciences are separate
816.33	or different, they're both being influenced
818.33	now and they're both having problems.
820.33	I did a project called S.E.E.ing the Future:
822.33	Science, Engineering and Education, and
824.33	it was looking at how to shed light on
826.33	most effective use of government funding.
828.33	We got a bunch of scientists in all stages
830.33	of their careers. They came to Dartmouth
832.33	College, where I was teaching, and they
834.33	talked about with theologians and financiers,
836.33	what are some of the issues of public
838.33	funding for science and engineering
840.33	research? What's most important about it?
842.33	There are some ideas that emerged that
844.33	I think have really powerful parallels
846.33	to the arts. The first thing they said was that
848.33	the circumstances that we find ourselves in
850.33	today in the sciences and engineering that
852.33	made us world leaders is very different
854.33	than the '40s, the '50s, and the '60s
857.33	and the '70s when we emerged
859.33	as world leaders, because we're no longer
861.33	in competition with fascism, with
863.33	Soviet-style communism, and by the way
865.33	that competition wasn't just military,
867.33	it included social competition
869.33	and political competition as well,
871.33	that allowed us to look at space
873.33	as one of those platforms to prove
875.33	that our social system was better.
878.33	Another thing they talked about was the
880.33	infrastructure that supports the sciences
882.33	is becoming obsolete. We look at
884.33	universities and colleges, small, mid-sized
887.33	community colleges across the country,
889.33	their laboratories are becoming obsolete,
892.33	and this is where we train most of our
894.33	science workers and our researchers,
896.33	and our teachers, by the way,
898.33	and then that there's a media that doesn't
900.33	support the dissemination of any more than
902.33	the most mundane and inane of information.
904.33	There's pseudo-science, crop circles,
906.33	alien autopsy, haunted houses,
908.33	or disasters. And that's what we see.
911.33	And this isn't really the information
913.33	you need to operate in everyday life
915.33	and figure out how to participate in this
917.33	democracy and determine what's going on.
919.33	They also said that there's a change
921.33	in the corporate mentality. Whereas
923.33	government money had always been there
925.33	for basic science and engineering research,
927.33	we also counted on some companies to do
929.33	some basic research, but what's happened
931.33	now is companies put more energy into
933.33	short-term product development
935.33	than they do in basic engineering
937.33	and science research.
940.33	And education is not keeping up.
943.33	In K through 12, people are taking out
946.33	wet labs. They think if we put a computer
948.33	in the room it's going to take the place
950.33	of actually, we're mixing the acids,
952.33	we're growing the potatoes.
954.33	And government funding is decreasing
956.33	in spending and then they're saying,
958.33	let's have corporations take over,
960.33	and that's not true. Government funding
962.33	should at least do things like recognize
964.33	cost-benefits of basic science and
966.33	engineering research. We have to know
968.33	that we have a responsibility
970.33	as global citizens in this world.
972.33	We have to look at the education
974.33	of humans. We need to build our resources
976.33	today to make sure that they're trained so
978.33	that they understand the importance of
980.33	these things, and we have to support
982.33	the vitality of science, and that doesn't
984.33	mean that everything has to have one thing
986.33	that's going to go on, or we know
988.33	exactly what's going to be the outcome of it,
990.33	but that we support the vitality and the
992.33	intellectual curiosity that goes along,
994.33	and if you think about those parallels
996.33	to the arts, the competition
998.33	with the Bolshoi Ballet spurred
1000.33	the Joffrey and the New York City Ballet
1002.33	to become better.
1004.33	Infrastructure museums, theaters,
1006.33	movie houses across the country
1008.33	are disappearing. We have more
1010.33	television stations with less to watch,
1012.33	we have more money spent on
1015.33	rewrites to get old television programs
1018.33	in the movies.
1020.33	We have corporate funding now that,
1022.33	when it goes to some company, when it
1024.33	goes to support the arts, it almost requires
1026.33	that the product be part of the picture
1028.33	that the artist draws, and we have
1031.33	stadiums that are named over and over
1033.33	again by corporations.
1035.33	In Houston, we're trying to figure out
1037.33	what to do with that Enron Stadium thing.
1039.33	(Laughter) And fine arts and education
1041.33	in the schools is disappearing, and we have
1043.33	a government that seems like it's gutting
1045.33	the NEA and other programs,
1047.33	so we have to really stop and think,
1049.33	what are we trying to do
1051.33	with the sciences and the arts?
1053.33	There's a need to revitalize them.
1055.33	We have to pay attention to it. I just want
1057.33	to tell you really quickly what I'm doing.
1059.33	(Applause)
1065.33	I want to tell you what I've been doing
1067.33	a little bit since... I feel this need
1071.33	to sort of integrate some of the ideas
1073.33	that I've had and run across over time.
1075.33	One of the things that I found out
1078.33	is that there's a need to repair
1080.33	the dichotomy between the mind and body
1082.33	as well. My mother always told me,
1084.33	you have to be observant, know what's
1086.33	going on in your mind and your body,
1088.33	and as a dancer I had this tremendous
1090.33	faith in my ability to know my body,
1092.33	just as I knew how to sense colors.
1094.33	Then I went to medical school, and I was
1096.33	supposed to just go on
1098.33	what the machine said about bodies.
1100.33	You know, you would ask patients
1102.33	questions and some people would tell you,
1104.33	"""Don't, don't, don't listen to what"
1106.33	"the patients said."" We know that patients"
1108.33	know and understand their bodies better,
1110.33	but these days we're trying to divorce them
1112.33	from that idea. We have to reconcile the
1114.33	patient's knowledge of their body
1116.33	with physician's measurements.
1118.33	We had someone talk about
1120.33	measuring emotions and getting machines
1122.33	to figure out what, to keep us
1124.33	from acting crazy. Right?
1126.33	No, we shouldn't measure,
1128.33	we shouldn't use machines
1130.33	to measure road rage and then do
1132.33	something to keep us from engaging in it.
1134.33	Maybe we can have machines help us
1136.33	to recognize that we have road rage and
1138.33	then we need to know how to control that
1140.33	without the machines. We even need to be
1142.33	able to recognize that without the machines.
1144.33	What I'm very concerned about
1146.33	is how do we bolster our self-awareness
1148.33	as humans, as biological organisms?
1151.33	Michael Moschen spoke of having to teach
1153.33	and learn how to feel with my eyes,
1155.33	to see with my hands.
1158.33	We have all kinds of possibilities to use
1161.33	our senses by, and that's
1163.33	what we have to do.
1165.33	That's what I want to do, is to try to use
1167.33	bioinstrumentation, those kind of things
1170.33	to help our senses in what we do,
1172.33	and that's the work I've been doing now as
1175.33	a company called BioSentient Corporation.
1177.33	I figured I'd have to do that ad, because
1179.33	I'm an entrepreneur, because entrepreneur
1181.33	says that that's somebody who does what
1183.33	they want to do because they're not broke
1185.33	enough that they have to get a real job.
1187.33	(Laughter) But that's the work I'm doing
1189.33	with BioSentient Corporation trying to figure
1191.33	out how do we integrate these things?
1193.33	Let me finish by saying that
1195.33	my personal design issue for the future
1198.33	is really about integrating, to think about
1200.33	that intuitive and that analytical.
1203.33	The arts and sciences are not separate.
1207.33	High school physics lesson before you
1209.33	leave. High school physics teacher used to
1211.33	hold up a ball. She would say this ball
1213.33	has potential energy, but nothing
1215.33	will happen to it, it can't do any work
1217.33	until I drop it and it changes states.
1219.33	I like to think of ideas as potential energy.
1222.33	They're really wonderful, but nothing
1224.33	will happen until we risk
1227.33	putting them into action.
1229.33	This conference is filled
1231.33	with wonderful ideas.
1233.33	We're going to share lots of things
1235.33	with people, but nothing's going to happen
1237.33	until we risk putting those ideas into action.
1240.33	We need to revitalize the arts and sciences
1242.33	of today, we need to take responsibility
1244.33	for the future. We can't hide behind saying
1246.33	it's just for company profits,
1249.33	or it's just a business, or I'm an artist
1251.33	or an academician.
1253.33	Here's how you judge what you're doing.
1255.33	I talked about that balance between
1257.33	intuitive, analytical.
1259.33	Fran Lebowitz, my favorite cynic,
1262.33	she said the three questions
1264.33	of greatest concern, now I'm going to
1266.33	add on to design, is,
1268.33	"""Is it attractive?"""
1270.33	That's the intuitive.
1272.33	"""Is it amusing?"" The analytical."
1275.33	"""And does it know its place?"""
1277.33	The balance. Thank you very much.
1280.33	(Applause)
