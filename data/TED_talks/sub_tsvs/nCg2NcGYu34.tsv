15.776	I'm going to tell you about an affliction I suffer from.
19.883	And I have a funny feeling that quite a few of you
22.387	suffer from it as well.
24.307	When I'm walking around an art gallery,
26.404	rooms and rooms full of paintings,
28.507	after about 15 or 20 minutes,
33.024	I realize I'm not thinking about the paintings.
34.915	I'm not connecting to them.
36.523	Instead, I'm thinking about that cup of coffee
39.027	I desperately need to wake me up.
42.027	I'm suffering from gallery fatigue.
45.211	How many of you out there suffer from --
47.587	yes. Ha ha, ha ha!
49.592	Now, sometimes you might last longer
51.742	than 20 minutes, or even shorter,
53.836	but I think we all suffer from it. And do you have
56.05	the accompanying guilt?
58.131	For me, I look at the paintings on the wall
61.118	and I think, somebody has decided to put them there,
64.133	thinks they're good enough to be on that wall,
66.661	but I don't always see it.
68.019	In fact, most of the time I don't see it.
70.683	And I leave feeling actually unhappy.
74.457	I feel guilty and unhappy with myself,
77.924	rather than thinking there's something wrong with the painting,
79.987	I think there's something wrong with me.
81.444	And that's not a good experience, to leave a gallery like that.
84.352	(Laughter)
85.623	The thing is, I think we should give ourselves a break.
87.932	If you think about going into a restaurant,
90.392	when you look at the menu, are you expected to order
94.079	every single thing on the menu?
96.262	No! You select.
98.144	If you go into a department store to buy a shirt,
101.319	are you going to try on every single shirt
104.296	and want every single shirt?
105.624	Of course not, you can be selective. It's expected.
109.751	How come, then, it's not so expected
112.372	to be selective when we go to an art gallery?
114.945	Why are we supposed to have a connection with every single painting?
118.24	Well I'm trying to take a different approach.
120.944	And there's two things I do:
122.562	When I go into a gallery, first of all, I go quite fast,
127.056	and I look at everything, and I pinpoint the ones
131.291	that make me slow down for some reason or other.
134.345	I don't even know why they make me slow down, but something
137.146	pulls me like a magnet
139.203	and then I ignore all the others, and I just go to that painting.
142.321	So it's the first thing I do is, I do my own curation.
144.785	I choose a painting. It might just be one painting in 50.
148.081	And then the second thing I do is I stand in front of that painting,
151.771	and I tell myself a story about it.
154.848	Why a story? Well, I think that we are wired,
158.446	our DNA tells us to tell stories.
162.337	We tell stories all the time about everything,
164.706	and I think we do it because the world is kind of a crazy, chaotic place,
169.817	and sometimes stories, we're trying to make sense of the world a little bit,
173.768	trying to bring some order to it.
175.937	Why not apply that to our looking at paintings?
179.928	So I now have this sort of restaurant menu
183.643	visiting of art galleries.
186.866	There are three paintings I'm going to show you now
190.074	that are paintings that made me stop in my tracks
193.138	and want to tell stories about them.
195.684	The first one needs little introduction --
199.235	"""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" by Johannes Vermeer,"
204.422	This is the most glorious painting.
206.922	I first saw it when I was 19,
209.066	and I immediately went out and got a poster of it,
211.346	and in fact I still have that poster. 30 years later it's hanging in my house.
215.503	It's accompanied me everywhere I've gone,
218.653	I never tire of looking at her.
220.997	What made me stop in my tracks about her to begin with
224.776	was just the gorgeous colors he uses
227.333	and the light falling on her face.
229.277	But I think what's kept me still coming back
232.061	year after year is another thing, and that is
235.117	the look on her face, the conflicted look on her face.
238.811	I can't tell if she's happy or sad,
241.229	and I change my mind all the time.
244.196	So that keeps me coming back.
247.795	One day, 16 years after I had this poster on my wall,
251.804	I lay in bed and looked at her,
254.486	and I suddenly thought, I wonder what
257.065	the painter did to her to make her look like that.
260.983	And it was the first time I'd ever thought that
263.927	the expression on her face is actually reflecting
266.727	how she feels about him.
268.866	Always before I'd thought of it as a portrait of a girl.
272.022	Now I began to think of it as a portrait of a relationship.
276.791	And I thought, well, what is that relationship?
279.623	So I went to find out. I did some research and discovered,
282.831	we have no idea who she is.
285.156	In fact, we don't know who any of the models
287.503	in any of Vermeer's paintings are,
289.863	and we know very little about Vermeer himself.
291.99	"Which made me go, ""Yippee!"""
294.764	I can do whatever I want, I can come up with whatever story I want to.
299.423	So here's how I came up with the story.
302.019	First of all, I thought,
303.896	I've got to get her into the house.
305.988	How does Vermeer know her?
308.476	Well, there've been suggestions that
310.02	she is his 12-year-old daughter.
314.443	The daughter at the time was 12 when he painted the painting.
316.668	And I thought, no, it's a very intimate look,
319.364	but it's not a look a daughter gives her father.
321.548	For one thing, in Dutch painting of the time,
323.388	if a woman's mouth was open, it was indicating sexual availability.
326.98	It would have been inappropriate for Vermeer
328.868	to paint his daughter like that.
330.764	So it's not his daughter, but it's somebody
332.644	close to him, physically close to him.
334.894	Well, who else would be in the house?
337.158	A servant, a lovely servant.
340.541	So, she's in the house.
342.102	How do we get her into the studio?
344.763	We don't know very much about Vermeer,
346.897	but the little bits that we do know, one thing we know
349.036	is that he married a Catholic woman, they lived with her mother
352.027	in a house where he had his own room
354.3	where he -- his studio. He also had 11 children.
358.583	It would have been a chaotic, noisy household.
361.66	And if you've seen Vermeer's paintings before,
364.604	you know that they're incredibly calm and quiet.
368.468	How does a painter paint such calm, quiet paintings with 11 kids around?
372.364	Well, he compartmentalizes his life.
374.66	"He gets to his studio, and he says, ""Nobody comes in here."
378.34	"Not the wife, not the kids. Okay, the maid can come in and clean."""
383.068	She's in the studio. He's got her in the studio, they're together.
390.119	And he decides to paint her.
392.199	He has her wear very plain clothes.
394.467	Now, all of the women, or most of the women in Vermeer's other paintings
397.838	wore velvet, silk, fur, very sumptuous materials.
403.804	This is very plain; the only thing that isn't plain
406.324	is her pearl earring.
408.364	Now, if she's a servant, there is no way she could afford
411.811	a pair of pearl earrings.
414.018	So those are not her pearl earrings. Whose are they?
417.28	We happen to know, there's a list of Catharina, the wife's clothes.
422.321	Amongst them a yellow coat with white fur,
425.937	a yellow and black bodice,
427.684	and you see these clothes on lots of other paintings,
431.378	different women in the paintings, Vermeer's paintings.
434.492	So clearly, her clothes were lent to various different women.
438.97	It's not such a leap of faith to take
441.489	that that pearl earring actually belongs to his wife.
445.073	So we've got all the elements for our story.
448.25	She's in the studio with him for a long time.
450.68	These paintings took a long time to make.
452.723	They would have spent the time alone, all that time.
455.594	She's wearing his wife's pearl earring.
457.594	She's gorgeous. She obviously loves him. She's conflicted.
460.409	And does the wife know? Maybe not.
463.201	And if she doesn't, well --
466.579	that's the story.
468.434	(Laughter)
470.611	The next painting I'm going to talk about
473.201	"is called ""Boy Building a House of Cards"" by Chardin."
476.448	He's an 18th-century French painter best known for his still lifes,
480.824	but he did occasionally paint people.
483.417	And in fact, he painted four versions of this painting,
487.384	different boys building houses of cards, all concentrated.
491.344	I like this version the best, because some of the boys
494.808	are older and some are younger, and to me, this one,
498.201	like Goldilocks's porridge, is just right.
501.153	He's not quite a child, and he's not quite a man.
505.144	He's absolutely balanced between innocence and experience,
509.937	and that made me stop in my tracks in front of this painting.
514.42	And I looked at his face. It's like a Vermeer painting a bit.
518.137	The light comes in from the left, his face is bathed
520.76	in this glowing light. It's right in the center of the painting,
522.984	and you look at it, and I found that when I was looking at it,
525.996	I was standing there going,
527.203	"""Look at me. Please look at me."""
530.156	And he didn't look at me. He was still looking at his cards,
532.892	and that's one of the seductive elements of this painting is,
535.644	he's so focused on what he's doing that he doesn't look at us.
540.134	And that is, to me, the sign of a masterpiece,
544.027	of a painting when there's a lack of resolution.
548.004	He's never going to look at me.
549.525	So I was thinking of a story where,
551.204	if I'm in this position, who could be there looking at him?
554.42	Not the painter, I don't want to think about the painter.
556.622	I'm thinking of an older version of himself.
559.148	He's a man, a servant, an older servant looking at this younger servant,
565.093	"saying, ""Look at me. I want to warn you about"
567.564	"what you're about to go through. Please look at me."""
570.014	And he never does.
571.54	"And that lack of resolution, the lack of resolution in ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" --"
575.343	we don't know if she's happy or sad.
577.387	I've written an entire novel about her,
579.036	and I still don't know if she's happy or sad.
581.036	Again and again, back to the painting,
583.14	looking for the answer, looking for the story to fill in that gap.
587.821	And we may make a story, and it satisfies us momentarily,
591.268	but not really, and we come back again and again.
597.083	The last painting I'm going to talk about
599.621	"is called ""Anonymous"" by anonymous. (Laughter)"
604.485	This is a Tudor portrait bought by the National Portrait Gallery.
607.536	They thought it was a man named Sir Thomas Overbury,
610.149	and then they discovered that it wasn't him,
612.813	and they have no idea who it is.
614.413	Now, in the National Portrait Gallery,
616.556	if you don't know the biography of the painting,
618.325	it's kind of useless to you.
619.949	They can't hang it on the wall, because they don't know who he is.
622.373	So unfortunately, this orphan spends most of his time in storage,
627.277	along with quite a number of other orphans,
629.421	some of them some beautiful paintings.
631.932	This painting made me stop in my tracks for three reasons:
636.935	One is the disconnection between his mouth
639.812	that's smiling and his eyes that are wistful.
642.517	He's not happy, and why isn't he happy?
645.524	The second thing that really attracted me
649.241	were his bright red cheeks.
650.957	He is blushing. He's blushing for his portrait being made!
654.564	This must be a guy who blushes all the time.
657.598	What is he thinking about that's making him blush?
659.74	The third thing that made me stop in my tracks
663.516	is his absolutely gorgeous doublet.
666.316	Silk, gray, those beautiful buttons.
669.884	And you know what it makes me think of,
671.516	is it's sort of snug and puffy; it's like a duvet spread over a bed.
676.308	I kept thinking of beds and red cheeks,
678.964	and of course I kept thinking of sex when I looked at him,
681.724	and I thought, is that what he's thinking about?
684.332	And I thought, if I'm going to make a story,
686.604	what's the last thing I'm going to put in there?
688.588	Well, what would a Tudor gentleman be preoccupied with?
692.218	And I thought, well, Henry VIII, okay.
694.148	He'd be preoccupied with his inheritance, with his heir.
698.292	Who is going to inherit his name and his fortune?
701.941	You put all those together, and you've got your story
705.821	to fill in that gap that makes you keep coming back.
709.175	Now, here's the story.
713.896	It's short.
716.826	"""Rosy"""
719.557	I am still wearing the white brocade doublet Caroline gave me.
723.607	It has a plain high collar, detachable sleeves
727.918	and intricate buttons of twisted silk thread,
731.094	set close together so that the fit is snug.
734.02	The doublet makes me think of a coverlet on the vast bed.
737.583	Perhaps that was the intention.
741.333	I first wore it at an elaborate dinner her parents held in our honor.
746.251	I knew even before I stood up to speak
748.077	that my cheeks were inflamed.
750.646	I have always flushed easily, from physical exertion,
754.347	from wine, from high emotion.
756.702	As a boy, I was teased by my sisters and by schoolboys,
761.167	but not by George.
763.614	Only George could call me Rosy.
766.688	I would not allow anyone else.
768.847	He managed to make the word tender.
773.071	When I made the announcement, George did not
775.87	turn rosy, but went pale as my doublet.
778.934	He should not have been surprised.
780.838	It has been a common assumption
782.51	that I would one day marry his cousin.
786.358	But it is difficult to hear the words aloud.
788.942	I know, I could barely utter them.
792.243	Afterwards, I found George on the terrace overlooking the kitchen garden.
796.645	Despite drinking steadily all afternoon, he was still pale.
801.902	We stood together and watched the maids cut lettuces.
806.127	"""What do you think of my doublet?"" I asked."
808.389	"He glanced at me. ""That collar looks to be strangling you."""
813.833	"""We will still see each other,"" I insisted."
815.837	"""We can still hunt and play cards and attend court."
819.125	"Nothing need change."""
820.861	George did not speak.
824.578	"""I am 23 years old. It is time for me to marry"
827.972	"and produce an heir. It is expected of me."""
832.077	George drained another glass of claret and turned to me.
835.658	"""Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials, James."
839.741	"I'm sure you'll be content together."""
844.577	He never used my nickname again.
847.894	Thank you.
849.653	(Applause)
853.035	Thank you.
854.217	(Applause)
