12.92	What started as a platform for hobbyists
14.92	is poised to become
14.92	a multibillion-dollar industry.
17.88	Inspection, environmental monitoring,
17.88	photography and film and journalism:
21.96	these are some of the potential
21.96	applications for commercial drones,
25.16	and their enablers
25.16	are the capabilities being developed
27.8	at research facilities around the world.
29.76	For example, before aerial
29.76	package delivery
32.4	entered our social consciousness,
34.24	an autonomous fleet of flying machines
34.24	built a six-meter-tall tower
38.24	composed of 1,500 bricks
40.2	in front of a live audience
40.2	at the FRAC Centre in France,
43.16	and several years ago,
43.16	they started to fly with ropes.
45.76	By tethering flying machines,
47.2	they can achieve high speeds
47.2	and accelerations in very tight spaces.
51	They can also autonomously build
51	tensile structures.
54.12	Skills learned include how to carry loads,
56.56	how to cope with disturbances,
58.04	and in general, how to interact
58.04	with the physical world.
61.16	Today we want to show you some
61.16	new projects that we've been working on.
64.52	Their aim is to push the boundary
64.52	of what can be achieved
67.48	with autonomous flight.
69.04	Now, for a system to function
69.04	autonomously,
71.52	it must collectively know the location
71.52	of its mobile objects in space.
76	Back at our lab at ETH Zurich,
77.92	we often use external cameras
77.92	to locate objects,
80.8	which then allows us to focus our efforts
82.8	on the rapid development
82.8	of highly dynamic tasks.
85.48	For the demos you will see today, however,
87.56	we will use new localization technology
87.56	developed by Verity Studios,
90.88	a spin-off from our lab.
92.52	There are no external cameras.
94.16	Each flying machine uses onboard sensors
94.16	to determine its location in space
99.24	and onboard computation
99.24	to determine what its actions should be.
103.28	The only external commands
103.28	are high-level ones
105.48	"such as ""take off"" and ""land."""
130.56	This is a so-called tail-sitter.
132.48	It's an aircraft that tries
132.48	to have its cake and eat it.
135.96	Like other fixed-wing aircraft,
135.96	it is efficient in forward flight,
139.24	much more so than helicopters
139.24	and variations thereof.
142.479	Unlike most other
142.479	fixed-wing aircraft, however,
144.92	it is capable of hovering,
146.44	which has huge advantages
146.44	for takeoff, landing
149.6	and general versatility.
151.48	There is no free lunch, unfortunately.
153.6	One of the limitations with tail-sitters
155.56	is that they're susceptible
155.56	to disturbances such as wind gusts.
158.56	We're developing new control
158.56	architectures and algorithms
161.28	that address this limitation.
170.56	The idea is for the aircraft to recover
172.84	no matter what state it finds itself in,
183.4	and through practice,
183.4	improve its performance over time.
195.6	(Applause)
202	OK.
213.48	When doing research,
214.72	we often ask ourselves
214.72	fundamental abstract questions
217.72	that try to get at the heart of a matter.
221.24	For example, one such question would be,
223.48	what is the minimum number of moving parts
223.48	needed for controlled flight?
227.52	Now, there are practical reasons
229.12	why you may want to know
229.12	the answer to such a question.
231.76	Helicopters, for example,
233.04	are affectionately known
233.04	as machines with a thousand moving parts
236.92	all conspiring to do you bodily harm.
240.64	It turns out that decades ago,
242.52	skilled pilots were able to fly
242.52	remote-controlled aircraft
245.72	that had only two moving parts:
247.64	a propeller and a tail rudder.
250	We recently discovered
250	that it could be done with just one.
253.6	This is the monospinner,
254.88	the world's mechanically simplest
254.88	controllable flying machine,
258.16	invented just a few months ago.
259.96	It has only one moving part, a propeller.
263.12	It has no flaps, no hinges, no ailerons,
266.72	no other actuators,
266.72	no other control surfaces,
269.279	just a simple propeller.
271.32	Even though it's mechanically simple,
273.399	there's a lot going on
273.399	in its little electronic brain
275.92	to allow it to fly in a stable fashion
275.92	and to move anywhere it wants in space.
280.16	Even so, it doesn't yet have
281.64	the sophisticated algorithms
281.64	of the tail-sitter,
284	which means that in order
284	to get it to fly,
286.024	I have to throw it just right.
288.8	And because the probability
288.8	of me throwing it just right is very low,
292.84	given everybody watching me,
294.76	what we're going to do instead
296.24	is show you a video
296.24	that we shot last night.
298.44	(Laughter)
310.32	(Applause)
323.08	If the monospinner
323.08	is an exercise in frugality,
326.84	this machine here, the omnicopter,
326.84	with its eight propellers,
330.32	is an exercise in excess.
332.92	What can you do with all this surplus?
335.08	The thing to notice
335.08	is that it is highly symmetric.
337.92	As a result, it is ambivalent
337.92	to orientation.
340.8	This gives it an extraordinary capability.
343.52	It can move anywhere it wants in space
345.76	irrespective of where it is facing
348.52	and even of how it is rotating.
351.04	It has its own complexities,
352.44	mainly having to do
352.44	with the interacting flows
355.12	from its eight propellers.
356.68	Some of this can be modeled,
356.68	while the rest can be learned on the fly.
360.56	Let's take a look.
404.76	(Applause)
412.72	If flying machines are going
412.72	to enter part of our daily lives,
415.649	they will need to become
415.649	extremely safe and reliable.
418.76	This machine over here
420.16	is actually two separate
420.16	two-propeller flying machines.
423.32	This one wants to spin clockwise.
425.08	This other one wants
425.08	to spin counterclockwise.
427.6	When you put them together,
428.96	they behave like one
428.96	high-performance quadrocopter.
443.64	If anything goes wrong, however --
445.32	a motor fails, a propeller fails,
445.32	electronics, even a battery pack --
449.8	the machine can still fly,
449.8	albeit in a degraded fashion.
453.16	We're going to demonstrate this to you now
453.16	by disabling one of its halves.
476.24	(Applause)
483.32	This last demonstration
484.68	is an exploration of synthetic swarms.
487.56	The large number of autonomous,
487.56	coordinated entities
490.56	offers a new palette
490.56	for aesthetic expression.
493.32	We've taken commercially available
493.32	micro quadcopters,
496.32	each weighing less
496.32	than a slice of bread, by the way,
498.84	and outfitted them
498.84	with our localization technology
501.28	and custom algorithms.
502.88	Because each unit
502.88	knows where it is in space
505	and is self-controlled,
506.4	there is really no limit to their number.
535.84	(Applause)
559.36	(Applause)
618.04	(Applause)
635.96	Hopefully, these demonstrations
635.96	will motivate you to dream up
639.08	new revolutionary roles
639.08	for flying machines.
642.56	That ultrasafe one over there for example
644.68	has aspirations to become
644.68	a flying lampshade on Broadway.
647.72	(Laughter)
649.8	The reality is that it is
649.8	difficult to predict
652	the impact of nascent technology.
654.12	And for folks like us, the real reward
654.12	is the journey and the act of creation.
659	It's a continual reminder
660.44	of how wonderful and magical
660.44	the universe we live in is,
663.84	that it allows creative, clever creatures
666.8	to sculpt it in such spectacular ways.
669.8	The fact that this technology
671.6	has such huge commercial
671.6	and economic potential
675.04	is just icing on the cake.
676.48	Thank you.
677.72	(Applause)
