15.854	I don't know why, but I'm continually amazed to think
19.079	that two and a half billion of us around the world
21.677	are connected to each other through the Internet
24.093	and that at any point in time
26.218	more than 30 percent of the world's population
28.968	can go online to learn, to create and to share.
34.083	And the amount of time each of us is spending doing all of this
37.646	is also continuing to go grow.
39.427	A recent study showed
40.885	that the young generation alone
42.385	is spending over eight hours a day online.
45.656	As the parent of a nine-year-old girl,
47.822	that number seems awfully low.
50.035	(Laughter)
51.385	But just as the Internet has opened up the world for each and every one of us,
55.458	it has also opened up each and every one of us to the world.
59.133	And increasingly, the price we're being asked to pay
61.989	for all of this connectedness
63.24	is our privacy.
65.254	Today, what many of us would love to believe
69.25	is that the Internet is a private place; it's not.
72.255	And with every click of the mouse and every touch of the screen,
75.34	we are like Hansel and Gretel
77.69	leaving breadcrumbs of our personal information
80.26	everywhere we travel through the digital woods.
82.702	We are leaving our birthdays, our places of residence,
87.552	our interests and preferences,
89.914	our relationships,
92.003	our financial histories, and on and on it goes.
95.764	Now don't get me wrong,
97.76	I'm not for one minute suggesting that sharing data is a bad thing.
101.247	In fact, when I know the data that's being shared
103.625	and I'm asked explicitly for my consent,
106.385	I want some sites to understand my habits.
108.802	It helps them suggest books for me to read
111.2	or movies for my family to watch
113.535	or friends for us to connect with.
115.991	But when I don't know and when I haven't been asked,
119.072	that's when the problem arises.
121.668	It's a phenomenon on the Internet today
123.385	called behavioral tracking,
125.135	and it is very big business.
126.802	In fact, there's an entire industry formed
129.26	around following us through the digital woods
131.597	and compiling a profile on each of us.
133.941	And when all of that data is held,
135.856	they can do almost whatever they want with it.
139.308	This is an area today that has very few regulations
142.677	and even fewer rules.
144.427	Except for some of the recent announcements here in the United States and in Europe,
148.01	it's an area of consumer protection that's almost entirely naked.
152.135	So let me expose this lurking industry a little bit further.
155.539	The visualization you see forming behind me is called Collusion
159.245	and it's an experimental browser add-on
162.718	that you can install in your Firefox browser
164.885	that helps you see where your Web data is going and who's tracking you.
169.581	The red dots you see up there
172.177	are sites that are behavioral tracking
174.093	that I have not navigated to, but are following me.
177.302	The blue dots are the sites that I've actually navigated directly to.
180.45	And the gray dots are sites that are also tracking me,
183.816	but I have no idea who they are.
185.916	All of them are connected, as you can see,
188.01	to form a picture of me on the Web.
190.26	And this is my profile.
191.802	So let me go from an example to something very specific and personal.
195.212	I installed Collusion in my own laptop two weeks ago
198.635	and I let it follow me around for what was a pretty typical day.
201.645	Now like most of you,
203.943	I actually start my day going online and checking email.
207.564	I then go to a news site, look for some headlines.
210.403	And in this particular case I happened to like one of them
213.927	on the merits of music literacy in schools
217.343	and I shared it over a social network.
219.593	Our daughter then joined us at the breakfast table,
222.26	"and I asked her, ""Is there an emphasis on music literacy in your school?"""
226.51	And she, of course, naturally as a nine-year-old,
228.51	"looked at me and said quizzically, ""What's literacy?"""
230.629	So I sent her online, of course, to look it up.
234.385	Now let me stop here.
236.51	We are not even two bites into breakfast
239.29	and there are already nearly 25 sites that are tracking me.
243.606	I have navigated to a total of four.
246.864	So let me fast-forward through the rest of my day.
250.17	I go to work, I check email,
252.451	I log onto a few more social sites, I blog,
255.141	I check more news reports, I share some of those news reports,
258.635	I go look at some videos,
260.697	pretty typical day -- in this case, actually fairly pedantic --
265.26	and at the end of the day, as my day winds down,
268.302	look at my profile.
271.343	The red dots have exploded.
273.433	The gray dots have grown exponentially.
276.039	All in all, there's over 150 sites
278.579	that are now tracking my personal information,
281.51	most all of them without my consent.
284.352	I look at this picture and it freaks me out.
287.599	This is nothing. I am being stalked across the Web.
292.081	And why is this happening?
294.398	Pretty simple -- it's huge business.
296.768	The revenue of the top handful of companies in this space
299.343	is over 39 billion dollars today.
301.718	And as adults, we're certainly not alone.
304.641	At the same time I installed my own Collusion profile,
307.635	I installed one for my daughter.
310.968	And on one single Saturday morning, over two hours on the Internet,
314.343	here's her Collusion profile.
317.485	This is a nine-year-old girl
320.38	navigating to principally children's sites.
324.205	I move from this, from freaked out to enraged.
327.677	This is no longer me being a tech pioneer or a privacy advocate;
332.387	this is me being a parent.
333.987	Imagine in the physical world
335.552	if somebody followed our children around with a camera and a notebook
338.839	and recorded their every movement.
340.865	I can tell you, there isn't a person in this room that would sit idly by.
344.385	We'd take action. It may not be good action, but we would take action.
347.81	(Laughter)
349.156	We can't sit idly by here either.
351.221	This is happening today.
353.279	Privacy is not an option,
355.481	and it shouldn't be the price we accept
357.322	for just getting on the Internet.
359.028	Our voices matter and our actions matter even more.
362.645	Today we've launched Collusion.
365.718	You can download it, install it in Firefox,
367.885	to see who is tracking you across the Web
370.427	and following you through the digital woods.
372.808	Going forward, all of our voices need to be heard.
375.87	Because what we don't know can actually hurt us.
379.01	Because the memory of the Internet is forever.
381.635	We are being watched.
383.314	It's now time for us to watch the watchers.
386.029	Thank you.
387.126	(Applause)
