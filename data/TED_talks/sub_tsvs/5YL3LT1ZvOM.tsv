15.827	In the 17th century, a woman named Giulia Tofana
20.358	had a very successful perfume business.
23.069	For over 50 years she ran it.
25.326	It sort of ended abruptly when she was executed — (Laughter) —
28.111	for murdering 600 men. You see, it wasn't a very good perfume.
33.542	In fact, it was completely odorless and tasteless and colorless,
37.408	but as a poison, it was the best money could buy,
40.732	so women flocked to her in order to murder their husbands.
44.525	It turns out that poisoners were a valued and feared group,
49.785	because poisoning a human being is a quite difficult thing.
53.954	The reason is, we have sort of a built-in poison detector.
57.289	You can see this as early as even in newborn infants.
60.553	If you are willing to do this, you can take a couple of drops
63.124	of a bitter substance or a sour substance,
65.687	and you'll see that face, the tongue stick out, the wrinkled nose,
69.459	as if they're trying to get rid of what's in their mouth.
72.331	This reaction expands into adulthood and becomes
75.283	sort of a full-blown disgust response, no longer just
78.803	about whether or not we're about to be poisoned,
81.255	but whenever there's a threat of physical contamination
84.212	from some source. But the face remains strikingly similar.
88.343	It has expanded more, though, than just keeping us away
92.296	from physical contaminants, and there's a growing
94.477	body of evidence to suggest that, in fact, this emotion
97.96	of disgust now influences our moral beliefs
101.002	and even our deeply held political intuitions.
104.898	Why this might be the case?
108.534	We can understand this process by understanding
111.529	a little bit about emotions in general. So the basic human emotions,
114.679	those kinds of emotions that we share with all other human beings,
117.874	exist because they motivate us to do good things
120.675	and they keep us away from doing bad things.
122.986	So by and large, they are good for our survival.
126.369	Take the emotion of fear, for instance. It keeps us away
129.178	from doing things that are really, really risky.
131.682	This photo taken just before his death — (Laughter) —
135.522	is actually a — No, one reason this photo is interesting
138.368	is because most people would not do this, and if they did,
141.985	they would not live to tell it, because fear would have
143.985	kicked in a long time ago to a natural predator.
147.66	Just like fear offers us protective benefits, disgust seems
151.267	to do the same thing, except for what disgust does is
153.601	keeps us away from not things that might eat us,
156.196	or heights, but rather things that might poison us,
158.861	or give us disease and make us sick.
161.458	So one of the features of disgust that makes it such
164.715	an interesting emotion is that it's very, very easy to elicit,
169.498	in fact more so than probably any of the other basic emotions,
172.381	and so I'm going to show you that with a couple of images
174.75	I can probably make you feel disgust.
176.633	So turn away. I'll tell you when you can turn back.
179.828	(Laughter)
180.961	I mean, you see it every day, right? I mean, come on. (Laughter)
185.294	(Audience: Ewww.)
186.507	Okay, turn back, if you didn't look.
189.516	Those probably made a lot of you in the audience
192.051	feel very, very disgusted, but if you didn't look,
195.886	I can tell you about some of the other things that have been shown
198.416	sort of across the world to make people disgusted,
201.099	things like feces, urine, blood, rotten flesh.
204.703	These are the sorts of things that it makes sense
206.537	for us to stay away from, because they might actually contaminate us.
209.791	In fact, just having a diseased appearance
212.086	or odd sexual acts, these things are also
214.486	things that give us a lot of disgust.
217.477	Darwin was probably one of the first scientists
219.855	to systematically investigate the human emotions,
221.798	and he pointed to the universal nature and the strength
225.487	of the disgust response.
227.336	This is an anecdote from his travels in South America.
230.607	"""In Tierro del Fuego a native touched with his finger"
232.343	some cold preserved meat while I was eating ...
234.848	and plainly showed disgust at its softness, whilst I felt
238.367	utter disgust at my food being touched by a naked savage — (Laughter) —
241.365	"though his hands did not appear dirty."""
243.522	"He later wrote, ""It's okay, some of my best friends are naked savages."" (Laughter)"
248.92	Well it turns out it's not only old-timey British scientists
251.664	who are this squeamish. I recently got a chance
253.945	to talk to Richard Dawkins for a documentary,
256.235	and I was able to disgust him a bunch of times. Here's my favorite.
260.102	"Richard Dawkins: ""We've evolved around courtship and sex,"
262.467	are attached to deep-rooted emotions and reactions
265.489	"that are hard to jettison overnight."""
270.189	David Pizarro: So my favorite part of this clip is that
274.226	Professor Dawkins actually gagged.
276.869	He jumps back, and he gags, and we had to do it three times,
280.454	and all three times he gagged. (Laughter)
284.01	And he was really gagging. I thought he might throw up on me, actually.
287.156	One of the features, though, of disgust,
290.372	is not just its universality and its strength,
293.302	but the way that it works through association.
296.341	So when one disgusting thing touches a clean thing,
300.076	that clean thing becomes disgusting, not the other way around.
303.43	This makes it very useful as a strategy if you want to
306.637	convince somebody that an object or an individual
308.403	or an entire social group is disgusting and should be avoided.
312.071	The philosopher Martha Nussbaum points this out
314.612	"in this quote: ""Thus throughout history, certain disgust"
316.696	properties -- sliminess, bad smell, stickiness, decay, foulness --
319.937	have been repeatedly and monotonously been associated with ...
322.237	Jews, women, homosexuals, untouchables, lower-class people --
326.089	"all of those are imagined as tainted by the dirt of the body."""
329.603	Let me give you just some examples of how, some powerful
332.735	examples of how this has been used historically.
335.107	This comes from a Nazi children's book published in 1938:
338.697	"""Just look at these guys! The louse-infested beards,"
341.507	the filthy, protruding ears, those stained, fatty clothes...
344.817	Jews often have an unpleasant sweetish odor.
347.583	"If you have a good nose, you can smell the Jews."""
350.376	A more modern example comes from people who try to
352.909	convince us that homosexuality is immoral.
355.37	This is from an anti-gay website, where they said
359.055	"gays are ""worthy of death for their vile ... sex practices."""
362.332	"They're like ""dogs eating their own vomit and sows wallowing in their own feces."""
365.998	These are disgust properties that are trying to be directly
368.742	linked to the social group that you should not like.
372.091	When we were first investigating the role of disgust in
374.863	moral judgment, one of the things we became interested in
378.732	was whether or not these sorts of appeals are more likely
383.035	to work in individuals who are more easily disgusted.
386.1	So while disgust, along with the other basic emotions,
388.229	are universal phenomena, it just really is true
390.845	that some people are easier to disgust than others.
393.143	You could probably see it in the audience members
394.829	when I showed you those disgusting images.
396.886	The way that we measured this was by a scale that was
399.586	constructed by some other psychologists
401.915	that simply asked people across a wide variety of situations
404.772	how likely they are to feel disgust.
406.873	So here are a couple of examples.
408.666	"""Even if I were hungry, I would not drink a bowl of my"
410.838	"favorite soup if it had been stirred by a used but thoroughly washed fly-swatter."""
414.646	"""Do you agree or disagree?"" (Laughter)"
416.211	"""While you are walking through a tunnel under a railroad track,"
418.491	"you smell urine. Would you be very disgusted or not at all disgusted?"""
422.155	If you ask enough of these, you can get a general overall
424.811	score of disgust sensitivity.
427.174	It turns out that this score is actually meaningful.
429.647	When you bring people into the laboratory and you ask
432.724	them if they're willing to engage in safe but disgusting behaviors
436.553	like eating chocolate that's been baked to look like dog poop,
441.575	or in this case eating some mealworms that are perfectly healthy but pretty gross,
445.54	your score on that scale actually predicts whether or not
448.531	you'll be willing to engage in those behaviors.
450.874	The first time that we set out to collect data on this
453.472	and associate it with political or moral beliefs,
455.482	we found a general pattern --
458.359	this is with the psychologists Yoel Inbar and Paul Bloom --
461.661	that in fact, across three studies we kept finding
465.681	that people who reported that they were easily disgusted
468.202	also reported that they were more politically conservative.
471.657	Another way to say this, though, is that people
473.541	who are very liberal are very hard to disgust. (Laughter)
478.948	In a more recent follow-up study, we were able to look at
483.218	a much greater sample, a much larger sample. In this case,
485.899	this is nearly 30,000 U.S. respondents,
488.491	and we find the same pattern. As you can see,
491.268	people who are on the very conservative side
493.213	of answering the political orientation scale are
495.915	also much more likely to report that they're easily disgusted.
498.685	This data set also allowed us to statistically control
501.18	for a number of things that we knew were both related
503.404	to political orientation and to disgust sensitivity.
506.319	So we were able to control for gender, age, income,
508.924	education, even basic personality variables,
512.215	and the result stays the same.
514.517	When we actually looked at not just self-reported political orientation,
517.943	but voting behavior, we were able to look geographically
520.843	across the nation. What we found was that in regions
523.789	in which people reported high levels of disgust sensitivity,
527.686	McCain got more votes.
529.673	So it not only predicted self-reported political orientation,
532.791	but actual voting behavior. And also we were able,
535.163	with this sample, to look across the world,
537.855	in 121 different countries we asked the same questions,
541.449	and as you can see, this is 121 countries collapsed
545.376	into 10 different geographical regions.
547.746	No matter where you look, what this is plotting is the size
550.37	of the relationship between disgust sensitivity and political orientation,
553.781	and no matter where we looked, we saw a very similar effect.
557.42	Other labs have actually looked at this as well
560.857	using different measures of disgust sensitivity,
563.034	so rather than asking people how easily disgusted they are,
565.586	they hook people up to physiological measures,
567.926	in this case skin conductance.
569.554	And what they've demonstrated is that people who report
571.782	being more politically conservative are also more physiologically aroused
575.908	when you show them disgusting images like the ones that I showed you.
579.482	Interestingly, what they also showed in a finding
581.651	that we kept getting in our previous studies as well
585.676	was that one of the strongest influences here is that
589.423	individuals who are very disgust-sensitive not only are
591.633	more likely to report being politically conservative, but
593.719	they're also very much more opposed to gay marriage
596.728	and homosexuality and pretty much a lot of
598.877	the socio-moral issues in the sexual domain.
602.642	So physiological arousal predicted, in this study,
606.131	attitudes toward gay marriage.
607.829	But even with all these data linking disgust sensitivity
611.048	and political orientation, one of the questions that remains is
614.207	what is the causal link here? Is it the case that
617.278	disgust really is shaping political and moral beliefs?
620.552	We have to resort to experimental methods to answer this,
623.112	and so what we can do is actually bring people into the lab
625.887	and disgust them and compare them to a control group
628.31	that hasn't been disgusted. It turns out that over
630.718	the past five years a number of researchers have done this,
633.446	and by and large the results have all been the same,
636.272	that when people are feeling disgust, their attitudes
638.701	shift towards the right of the political spectrum,
640.804	toward more moral conservatism as well.
643.48	So this is whether you use a foul odor, a bad taste,
647.16	from film clips, from post-hypnotic suggestions of disgust,
652.45	images like the ones I've shown you, even just
654.816	reminding people that disease is prevalent and they should
656.779	be wary of it and wash up, right, to keep clean,
660.418	these all have similar effects on judgment.
663.198	Let me just give you an example from a recent study
665.564	that we conducted. We asked participants
668.524	to just simply give us their opinion of a variety of social groups,
673.221	and we either made the room smell gross or not.
677.633	When the room smelled gross, what we saw was that
680.804	individuals actually reported more negative attitudes toward gay men.
684.475	Disgust didn't influence attitudes toward all the other
686.698	social groups that we asked, including African-Americans,
689.091	the elderly. It really came down to the attitudes they had
692.953	toward gay men.
694.346	In another set of studies we actually simply reminded people --
697.907	this was at a time when the swine flu was going around --
699.833	we reminded people that in order to prevent the spread
702.317	of the flu that they ought to wash their hands.
706.035	For some participants, we actually had them take questionnaires
710.45	next to a sign that reminded them to wash their hands.
713.371	And what we found was that just taking a questionnaire
715.891	next to this hand-sanitizing reminder made individuals
719.604	report being more politically conservative.
722.767	And when we asked them a variety of questions about
724.804	the rightness or wrongness of certain acts, what we also
728.227	found was that simply being reminded that they ought
730.542	to wash their hands made them more morally conservative.
733.851	In particular, when we asked them questions about
736.148	sort of taboo but fairly harmless sexual practices,
739.922	just being reminded that they ought to wash their hands
742.548	made them think that they were more morally wrong.
745.111	Let me give you an example of what I mean by harmless
747.511	but taboo sexual practice. We gave them scenarios.
750.276	One of them said a man is house-sitting for his grandmother.
754.034	When his grandmother's away, he has sex with his girlfriend
756.752	on his grandma's bed.
758.1	In another one, we said a woman enjoys masturbating
760.597	with her favorite teddy bear cuddled next to her. (Laughter)
764.491	People find these to be more morally abhorrent
767.123	if they've been reminded to wash their hands. (Laughter)
771.439	(Laughter)
774.631	Okay. The fact that emotions influence our judgment
778.16	should come as no surprise. I mean,
780.043	that's part of how emotions work.
781.444	They not only motivate you to behave in certain ways,
783.008	but they change the way you think.
785.092	In the case of disgust, what is a little bit more surprising
787.882	is the scope of this influence. It makes perfect sense,
791.327	and it's a very good emotion for us to have, that disgust
794.206	would make me change the way that I perceive
796.862	the physical world whenever contamination is possible.
799.905	It makes less sense that an emotion that was built
802.837	to prevent me from ingesting poison should predict
805.743	who I'm going to vote for in the upcoming presidential election.
809.119	The question of whether disgust ought to influence
811.927	our moral and political judgments
814.279	certainly has to be complex, and might depend on exactly
817.415	what judgments we're talking about, and as a scientist,
820.097	we have to conclude sometimes that the scientific method
822.103	is just ill-equipped to answer these sorts of questions.
825.607	But one thing that I am fairly certain about is,
827.655	at the very least, what we can do with this research is
830.474	point to what questions we ought to ask in the first place.
833.326	Thank you. (Applause)
