12.76	Late in January 1975,
15.4	a 17-year-old German girl
15.4	called Vera Brandes
19.84	walked out onto the stage
19.84	of the Cologne Opera House.
24.24	The auditorium was empty.
27.04	It was lit only by the dim, green glow
27.04	of the emergency exit sign.
32.2	This was the most
32.2	exciting day of Vera's life.
36.16	She was the youngest
36.16	concert promoter in Germany,
39.2	and she had persuaded
39.2	the Cologne Opera House
41.64	to host a late-night concert of jazz
45	from the American musician, Keith Jarrett.
48.8	1,400 people were coming.
51.84	And in just a few hours,
53.44	Jarrett would walk out on the same stage,
55.88	he'd sit down at the piano
57.24	and without rehearsal or sheet music,
61.08	he would begin to play.
64.32	But right now,
65.56	Vera was introducing Keith
65.56	to the piano in question,
69.16	and it wasn't going well.
71.12	Jarrett looked to the instrument
71.12	a little warily,
73.8	played a few notes,
75.36	walked around it,
76.599	played a few more notes,
78.08	muttered something to his producer.
79.8	Then the producer
79.8	came over to Vera and said ...
84.28	"""If you don't get a new piano,"
84.28	"Keith can't play."""
90	There'd been a mistake.
91.48	The opera house had provided
91.48	the wrong instrument.
93.88	This one had this harsh,
93.88	tinny upper register,
96.56	because all the felt had worn away.
99.64	The black notes were sticking,
102.8	the white notes were out of tune,
104.72	the pedals didn't work
106.4	and the piano itself was just too small.
108.6	It wouldn't create the volume
110.04	that would fill a large space
110.04	such as the Cologne Opera House.
114.52	So Keith Jarrett left.
118.4	He went and sat outside in his car,
121.04	leaving Vera Brandes
123	to get on the phone
123	to try to find a replacement piano.
127.68	Now she got a piano tuner,
129.32	but she couldn't get a new piano.
132.16	And so she went outside
134.88	and she stood there in the rain,
137.52	talking to Keith Jarrett,
140	begging him not to cancel the concert.
144.16	And he looked out of his car
145.6	at this bedraggled,
145.6	rain-drenched German teenager,
150.28	took pity on her,
152.08	and said,
153.96	"""Never forget ... only for you."""
159.12	And so a few hours later,
160.92	Jarrett did indeed step out
160.92	onto the stage of the opera house,
165.4	he sat down at the unplayable piano
169.6	and began.
171.32	(Music)
184.72	Within moments it became clear
184.72	that something magical was happening.
190.08	Jarrett was avoiding
190.08	those upper registers,
192.68	he was sticking to the middle
192.68	tones of the keyboard,
195.32	which gave the piece
195.32	a soothing, ambient quality.
199.96	But also, because the piano was so quiet,
202.52	he had to set up these rumbling,
202.52	repetitive riffs in the bass.
206.96	And he stood up twisting,
206.96	pounding down on the keys,
212.24	desperately trying to create enough volume
212.24	to reach the people in the back row.
217.88	It's an electrifying performance.
219.92	It somehow has this peaceful quality,
222.88	and at the same time it's full of energy,
224.96	it's dynamic.
227.2	And the audience loved it.
229.56	Audiences continue to love it
231.24	because the recording of the KÃ¶ln Concert
234.36	is the best-selling piano album in history
236.88	and the best-selling
236.88	solo jazz album in history.
242.56	Keith Jarrett had been handed a mess.
246.28	He had embraced that mess, and it soared.
252.52	But let's think for a moment
252.52	about Jarrett's initial instinct.
257.36	He didn't want to play.
258.96	Of course,
260.2	I think any of us,
260.2	in any remotely similar situation,
263.16	would feel the same way,
263.16	we'd have the same instinct.
265.76	We don't want to be asked
265.76	to do good work with bad tools.
269.079	We don't want to have to overcome
269.079	unnecessary hurdles.
274.16	But Jarrett's instinct was wrong,
277.12	and thank goodness he changed his mind.
279.84	And I think our instinct is also wrong.
284.8	I think we need to gain
284.8	a bit more appreciation
288.24	for the unexpected advantages
288.24	of having to cope with a little mess.
295.56	So let me give you some examples
297.72	from cognitive psychology,
300.2	from complexity science,
301.64	from social psychology,
303.12	and of course, rock 'n' roll.
305.68	So cognitive psychology first.
307.76	We've actually known for a while
309.6	that certain kinds of difficulty,
311.96	certain kinds of obstacle,
313.56	can actually improve our performance.
315.346	For example,
317.08	the psychologist Daniel Oppenheimer,
318.84	a few years ago,
320.08	teamed up with high school teachers.
322.16	And he asked them to reformat the handouts
324.92	that they were giving
324.92	to some of their classes.
328.2	So the regular handout would be formatted
328.2	in something straightforward,
331.558	such as Helvetica or Times New Roman.
334.84	But half these classes were getting
334.84	handouts that were formatted
337.88	in something sort of intense,
337.88	like Haettenschweiler,
341.6	or something with a zesty bounce,
341.6	like Comic Sans italicized.
345.64	Now, these are really ugly fonts,
347.48	and they're difficult fonts to read.
349.68	But at the end of the semester,
351.8	students were given exams,
354.44	and the students who'd been asked
354.44	to read the more difficult fonts,
358.12	had actually done better on their exams,
360.2	in a variety of subjects.
361.76	And the reason is,
363.8	the difficult font had slowed them down,
366.36	forced them to work a bit harder,
368.44	to think a bit more
368.44	about what they were reading,
371.04	to interpret it ...
373.36	and so they learned more.
376.32	Another example.
378.76	The psychologist Shelley Carson
378.76	has been testing Harvard undergraduates
383.88	for the quality
383.88	of their attentional filters.
386.88	What do I mean by that?
388.28	What I mean is,
388.28	imagine you're in a restaurant,
390.52	you're having a conversation,
392.28	there are all kinds of other conversations
392.28	going on in the restaurant,
395.44	you want to filter them out,
396.8	you want to focus
396.8	on what's important to you.
398.96	Can you do that?
400.2	If you can, you have
400.2	good, strong attentional filters.
403.2	But some people really struggle with that.
405.28	Some of Carson's undergraduate
405.28	subjects struggled with that.
409.04	They had weak filters,
409.04	they had porous filters --
412	let a lot of external information in.
415.4	And so what that meant is they were
415.4	constantly being interrupted
418.56	by the sights and the sounds
418.56	of the world around them.
421.16	If there was a television on
421.16	while they were doing their essays,
424.24	they couldn't screen it out.
425.68	Now, you would think
425.68	that that was a disadvantage ...
429.48	but no.
430.72	When Carson looked at what
430.72	these students had achieved,
434.72	the ones with the weak filters
436.52	were vastly more likely
438.96	to have some real
438.96	creative milestone in their lives,
441.76	to have published their first novel,
444.12	to have released their first album.
447.2	These distractions were actually
447.2	grists to their creative mill.
450.92	They were able to think outside the box
450.92	because their box was full of holes.
456.2	Let's talk about complexity science.
457.96	So how do you solve a really complex --
459.842	the world's full
459.842	of complicated problems --
461.88	how do you solve
461.88	a really complicated problem?
464.08	For example, you try to make a jet engine.
466.24	There are lots and lots
466.24	of different variables,
468.48	the operating temperature, the materials,
470.457	all the different dimensions, the shape.
472.92	You can't solve that kind
472.92	of problem all in one go,
475.48	it's too hard.
476.72	So what do you do?
477.96	Well, one thing you can do
477.96	is try to solve it step-by-step.
482.92	So you have some kind of prototype
484.64	and you tweak it,
484.64	you test it, you improve it.
488.08	You tweak it, you test it, you improve it.
492.04	Now, this idea of marginal gains
492.04	will eventually get you a good jet engine.
497.56	And it's been quite widely
497.56	implemented in the world.
500.88	So you'll hear about it, for example,
500.88	in high performance cycling,
504.4	web designers will talk about trying
504.4	to optimize their web pages,
507.72	they're looking
507.72	for these step-by-step gains.
510.04	That's a good way
510.04	to solve a complicated problem.
514.44	But you know what would
514.44	make it a better way?
518.6	A dash of mess.
521.32	You add randomness,
523.36	early on in the process,
524.76	you make crazy moves,
526.28	you try stupid things that shouldn't work,
529.679	and that will tend to make
529.679	the problem-solving work better.
532.72	And the reason for that is
534.28	the trouble with the step-by-step process,
536.36	the marginal gains,
537.6	is they can walk you
537.6	gradually down a dead end.
541.16	And if you start with the randomness,
541.16	that becomes less likely,
545.4	and your problem-solving
545.4	becomes more robust.
550.44	Let's talk about social psychology.
552.72	So the psychologist Katherine Phillips,
552.72	with some colleagues,
555.84	recently gave murder mystery
555.84	problems to some students,
559.92	and these students
559.92	were collected in groups of four
562.8	and they were given dossiers
562.8	with information about a crime --
566.16	alibis and evidence,
566.16	witness statements and three suspects.
571	And the groups of four students
571	were asked to figure out who did it,
575.2	who committed the crime.
577.28	And there were two treatments
577.28	in this experiment.
580.76	In some cases these were four friends,
584	they all knew each other well.
586.16	In other cases,
587.96	three friends and a stranger.
591.04	And you can see where I'm going with this.
593.12	Obviously I'm going to say
594.4	that the groups with the stranger
594.4	solved the problem more effectively,
597.84	which is true, they did.
599.8	Actually, they solved the problem
599.8	quite a lot more effectively.
603.32	So the groups of four friends,
607.12	they only had a 50-50 chance
607.12	of getting the answer right.
610.12	Which is actually not that great --
611.84	in multiple choice, for three answers?
614.8	(Laughter)
616	The three friends and the stranger,
617.72	even though the stranger
617.72	didn't have any extra information,
620.56	even though it was just a case
622.12	of how that changed the conversation
622.12	to accommodate that awkwardness,
628.44	the three friends and the stranger,
630.16	they had a 75 percent chance
630.16	of finding the right answer.
632.85	That's quite a big leap in performance.
634.6	But I think what's really interesting
636.96	is not just that the three friends
636.96	and the stranger did a better job,
640.223	but how they felt about it.
642.4	So when Katherine Phillips
642.4	interviewed the groups of four friends,
647.36	they had a nice time,
649.24	they also thought they'd done a good job.
652.72	They were complacent.
654.8	When she spoke to the three
654.8	friends and the stranger,
657.32	they had not had a nice time --
658.84	it's actually rather difficult,
658.84	it's rather awkward ...
662.48	and they were full of doubt.
666.2	They didn't think they'd done a good job
666.2	even though they had.
670.08	And I think that really exemplifies
671.84	the challenge that we're
671.84	dealing with here.
674.68	Because, yeah --
676.52	the ugly font,
678.4	the awkward stranger,
680.2	the random move ...
682.28	these disruptions help us solve problems,
685.68	they help us become more creative.
688.04	But we don't feel that they're helping us.
690.12	We feel that they're
690.12	getting in the way ...
693.04	and so we resist.
696	And that's why the last example
696	is really important.
699.36	So I want to talk about somebody
701.6	from the background
701.6	of the world of rock 'n' roll.
706.56	And you may know him,
706.56	he's actually a TED-ster.
709.48	His name is Brian Eno.
710.88	He is an ambient composer --
710.88	rather brilliant.
713.72	He's also a kind of catalyst
717.16	behind some of the great
717.16	rock 'n' roll albums of the last 40 years.
721.2	"He's worked with David Bowie on ""Heroes,"""
724.84	"he worked with U2 on ""Achtung Baby"""
724.84	"and ""The Joshua Tree,"""
728	he's worked with DEVO,
729.56	he's worked with Coldplay,
729.56	he's worked with everybody.
732.16	And what does he do to make
732.16	these great rock bands better?
737.72	Well, he makes a mess.
739.84	He disrupts their creative processes.
741.68	It's his role to be the awkward stranger.
743.8	It's his role to tell them
745.24	that they have to play
745.24	the unplayable piano.
748.44	And one of the ways
748.44	in which he creates this disruption
751.12	is through this remarkable
751.12	deck of cards --
754.68	I have my signed copy here --
754.68	thank you, Brian.
758.56	They're called The Oblique Strategies,
760.44	he developed them with a friend of his.
762.8	And when they're stuck in the studio,
766.88	Brian Eno will reach for one of the cards.
769.2	He'll draw one at random,
770.68	and he'll make the band
770.68	follow the instructions on the card.
774.96	So this one ...
777.04	"""Change instrument roles."""
778.36	Yeah, everyone swap instruments --
778.36	Drummer on the piano --
781.099	Brilliant, brilliant idea.
783.12	"""Look closely at the most "
783.12	"embarrassing details. Amplify them."""
788.36	"""Make a sudden, destructive,"
788.36	"unpredictable action. Incorporate."""
794.96	These cards are disruptive.
797.08	Now, they've proved their worth
797.08	in album after album.
801.88	The musicians hate them.
804.2	(Laughter)
805.72	So Phil Collins was playing drums
805.72	on an early Brian Eno album.
809.16	He got so frustrated he started
809.16	throwing beer cans across the studio.
814.4	Carlos Alomar, great rock guitarist,
816.8	working with Eno
816.8	"on David Bowie's ""Lodger"" album,"
820.6	and at one point
820.6	he turns to Brian and says,
823.2	"""Brian, this experiment is stupid."""
829.36	But the thing is
829.36	it was a pretty good album,
833.12	but also,
835.04	Carlos Alomar, 35 years later,
835.04	now uses The Oblique Strategies.
839.88	And he tells his students
839.88	to use The Oblique Strategies
842.64	because he's realized something.
845.24	Just because you don't like it
845.24	doesn't mean it isn't helping you.
852	The strategies actually
852	weren't a deck of cards originally,
854.786	they were just a list --
856	list on the recording studio wall.
857.84	A checklist of things
857.84	you might try if you got stuck.
863.28	The list didn't work.
866.16	Know why?
869.4	Not messy enough.
871.68	Your eye would go down the list
873.72	and it would settle on whatever
873.72	was the least disruptive,
877.8	the least troublesome,
880.48	which of course misses the point entirely.
886.16	And what Brian Eno came to realize was,
888.56	yes, we need to run
888.56	the stupid experiments,
893.08	we need to deal
893.08	with the awkward strangers,
895.16	we need to try to read the ugly fonts.
897.32	These things help us.
898.6	They help us solve problems,
900	they help us be more creative.
901.92	But also ...
904.32	we really need some persuasion
904.32	if we're going to accept this.
908.2	So however we do it ...
910.4	whether it's sheer willpower,
912.48	whether it's the flip of a card
915.56	or whether it's a guilt trip
915.56	from a German teenager,
919.68	all of us, from time to time,
921.84	need to sit down and try and play
921.84	the unplayable piano.
927.64	Thank you.
928.88	(Applause)
