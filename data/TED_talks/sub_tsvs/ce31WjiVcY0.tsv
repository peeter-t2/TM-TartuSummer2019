12.857	You've heard of your I.Q.,
12.857	your general intelligence,
15.716	but what's your Psy-Q?
17.392	How much do you know
17.392	about what makes you tick,
19.629	and how good are you
19.629	at predicting other people's behavior
22.374	or even your own?
23.88	And how much of what you think you know
23.88	about psychology is wrong?
27.159	Let's find out by counting down
27.159	the top 10 myths of psychology.
30.947	You've probably heard it said
30.947	that when it comes to their psychology,
34.343	it's almost as if men are from Mars
34.343	and women are from Venus.
37.235	But how different
37.235	are men and women really?
39.264	To find out, let's start
39.264	by looking at something
41.518	on which men and women really do differ
43.495	and plotting some psychological
43.495	gender differences on the same scale.
46.943	One thing men and women
46.943	do really differ on
49.116	is how far they can throw a ball.
50.913	So if we look at the data for men here,
52.803	we see what is called
52.803	a normal distribution curve.
55.274	A few men can throw a ball really far,
55.274	and a few men not far at all,
58.482	but most a kind of average distance.
60.252	And women share
60.252	the same distribution as well,
62.416	but actually there's
62.416	quite a big difference.
64.465	In fact, the average man
64.465	can throw a ball further
66.913	than about 98 percent of all women.
68.62	So now let's look at what
68.62	some psychological gender differences
71.647	look like on the same standardized scale.
74.504	Any psychologist will tell you
76.09	that men are better
76.09	at spatial awareness than women --
78.635	so things like map-reading, 
78.635	for example -- and it's true,
81.373	but let's have a look
81.373	at the size of this difference.
83.863	It's tiny; the lines are so close
83.863	together they almost overlap.
87.25	In fact, the average woman is better
87.25	than 33 percent of all men,
91.244	and of course, if that was 50 percent,
93.125	then the two genders
93.125	would be exactly equal.
95.181	It's worth bearing in mind that this
95.181	difference and the next one I'll show you
98.839	are pretty much the biggest
98.839	psychological gender differences
101.664	ever discovered in psychology.
103.101	So here's the next one.
104.212	Any psychologist will tell you
104.212	that women are better
106.65	with language and grammar than men.
108.315	So here's performance
108.315	on the standardized grammar test.
110.904	There go the women. There go the men.
112.861	Again, yes, women are better on average,
112.861	but the lines are so close
116.56	that 33 percent of men
116.56	are better than the average woman,
120.047	and again, if it was 50 percent,
121.72	that would represent
121.72	complete gender equality.
124.462	So it's not really
124.462	a case of Mars and Venus.
126.583	It's more a case of, if anything,
126.583	Mars and Snickers:
129.25	basically the same, but one's maybe 
129.25	slightly nuttier than the other.
133.612	I won't say which.
135.638	Now we've got you warmed up.
137.503	Let's psychoanalyze you using
137.503	the famous Rorschach inkblot test.
140.539	So you can probably see two, I dunno,
140.539	two bears or two people or something.
144.122	But what do you think they're doing?
145.875	Put your hand up if you think
145.875	they're saying hello.
149.059	Not many people. Okay.
150.87	Put your hands up if you think
150.87	they are high-fiving.
153.337	Okay. What if you think they're fighting?
155.307	Only a few people there.
156.562	Okay, so if you think they're
156.562	saying hello or high-fiving,
159.639	then that means you're a friendly person.
161.63	If you think they're fighting,
163.22	you're a bit more of a 
163.22	nasty, aggressive person.
165.536	Are you a lover or a fighter, basically.
167.476	What about this one?
168.763	This isn't really a voting one, so on 
168.763	three everyone shout out what you see.
172.385	One, two, three.
172.385	(Audience shouting)
175.549	I heard hamster. Who said hamster?
177.241	That was very worrying.
178.778	A guy there said hamster.
180.291	Well, you should see
180.291	some kind of two-legged animal here,
183.599	and then the mirror image of them there.
185.983	If you didn't, then this means
185.983	that you have difficulty
189.414	processing complex situations
189.414	where there's a lot going on.
193.504	Except, of course,
193.504	it doesn't mean that at all.
195.729	Rorschach inkblot tests
195.729	have basically no validity
198.4	when it comes to diagnosing
198.4	people's personality
200.675	and are not used
200.675	by modern-day psychologists.
203.136	In fact, one recent study found
203.136	that when you do try
206.555	to diagnose people's personalities
206.555	using Rorschach inkblot tests,
209.614	schizophrenia was diagnosed
211.356	in about one sixth of apparently
211.356	perfectly normal participants.
215.349	So if you didn't do that well on this,
218.182	maybe you are not
218.182	a very visual type of person.
220.736	So let's do another
220.736	quick quiz to find out.
223.105	When making a cake, do you prefer to --
223.105	so hands up for each one again --
226.883	do you prefer to use
226.883	a recipe book with pictures?
229.652	Yeah, a few people.
231.672	Have a friend talk you through?
234.412	Or have a go, making it up
234.412	as you go along?
237.075	Quite a few people there.
238.567	Okay, so if you said A,
240.287	then this means that you
240.287	are a visual learner
242.459	and you learn best when information
242.459	is presented in a visual style.
245.987	If you said B, it means
245.987	you're an auditory learner,
248.569	that you learn best when information
248.569	is presented to you in an auditory format.
252.294	And if you said C, it means
252.294	that you're a kinesthetic learner,
255.229	that you learn best when you get stuck in
255.229	and do things with your hands.
258.63	Except, of course,
258.63	as you've probably guessed,
260.788	that it doesn't, because
260.788	the whole thing is a complete myth.
263.607	Learning styles are made up and are 
263.607	not supported by scientific evidence.
267.465	So we know this because in
267.465	tightly controlled experimental studies,
271.021	when learners are given material to learn
273.142	either in their preferred style
273.142	or an opposite style,
275.762	it makes no difference at all to the
275.762	amount of information that they retain.
279.338	And if you think about it
279.338	for just a second,
281.404	it's just obvious
281.404	that this has to be true.
283.482	It's obvious that
283.482	the best presentation format
286.054	depends not on you,
286.054	but on what you're trying to learn.
289.357	Could you learn to drive a car,
289.357	for example,
291.479	just by listening to someone
291.479	telling you what to do
293.897	with no kinesthetic experience?
295.525	Could you solve simultaneous equations
297.341	by talking them through in your head
297.341	and without writing them down?
300.487	Could you revise 
300.487	for your architecture exams
302.588	using interpretive dance
302.588	if you're a kinesthetic learner?
305.261	No. What you need to do 
305.261	is match the material to be learned
308.202	to the presentation format, not you.
311.977	I know many of you are A-level students
314.126	that will have recently gotten
314.126	your GCSE results.
316.418	And if you didn't quite get
316.418	what you were hoping for,
318.976	then you can't really blame
318.976	your learning style,
321.323	but one thing that you might want
321.323	to think about blaming is your genes.
324.95	So what this is all about is a
324.95	recent study at University College London
328.635	found that 58 percent of the variation
331.189	between different students
331.189	and their GCSE results
334.44	was down to genetic factors.
336.097	That sounds like a very precise figure,
336.097	so how can we tell?
339.233	Well, when we want to unpack
339.233	the relative contributions
342.738	of genes and the environment,
344.842	what we can do is do a twin study.
347.071	So identical twins share
350.647	and 100 percent of their genes,
352.551	whereas non-identical twins
352.551	share 100 percent of their environment,
355.773	but just like any brother and sister,
355.773	share only 50 percent of their genes.
359.509	So by comparing how similar
359.509	GCSE results are in identical twins
363.707	versus non-identical twins,
366.018	and doing some clever math,
367.364	we can an idea of how much variation
367.364	and performance is due to the environment
371.265	and how much is due to genes.
373.401	And it turns out that it's
373.401	about 58 percent due to genes.
377.178	So this isn't to undermine the hard work
377.178	that you and your teachers here put in.
380.941	If you didn't quite get the GCSE results
380.941	that you were hoping for,
384.072	then you can always try blaming
384.072	your parents, or at least their genes.
388.578	One thing that you shouldn't blame
390.606	is being a left-brained
390.606	or right-brained learner,
393.068	because again, this is a myth.
394.879	So the myth here is that
394.879	the left brain is logical,
397.636	it's good with equations like this,
399.435	and the right brain is more creative,
399.435	so the right brain is better at music.
403.534	But again, this is a myth
403.534	because nearly everything that you do
406.465	involves nearly all parts
406.465	of your brain talking together,
409.275	even just the most mundane thing
409.275	like having a normal conversation.
412.595	However, perhaps one reason
412.595	why this myth has survived
415.938	is that there is
415.938	a slight grain of truth to it.
418.18	So a related version of the myth
419.79	is that left-handed people are
419.79	more creative than right-handed people,
423.073	which kind of makes sense because
423.073	your brain controls the opposite hands,
426.527	so left-handed people,
427.887	the right side of the brain
427.887	is slightly more active
430.313	than the left-hand side of the brain,
432.118	and the idea is the right-hand side
432.118	is more creative.
434.606	Now, it isn't true per se
436.003	that left-handed people are more creative
436.003	than right-handed people.
439.204	What is true that ambidextrous people,
441.619	or people who use both hands
441.619	for different tasks,
444.312	are more creative thinkers
444.312	than one-handed people,
448.074	because being ambidextrous involves
449.807	having both sides of the brain
449.807	talk to each other a lot,
452.536	which seems to be involved
452.536	in creating flexible thinking.
456.298	The myth of the creative left-hander
458.113	arises from the fact
458.113	that being ambidextrous
460.171	is more common amongst 
460.171	left-handers than right-handers,
463.298	so a grain of truth in the idea
463.298	of the creative left-hander,
466.347	but not much.
467.694	A related myth that you've
467.694	probably heard of
470.131	is that we only use
472.504	This is, again, a complete myth.
474.03	Nearly everything that we do,
474.03	even the most mundane thing,
476.749	uses nearly all of our brains.
478.932	That said, it is of course true
482.693	that most of us don't use our brainpower
482.693	quite as well as we could.
487.273	So what could we do
487.273	to boost our brainpower?
490.239	Maybe we could listen
490.239	to a nice bit of Mozart.
492.377	Have you heard of the idea
492.377	of the Mozart effect?
495.095	So the idea is that listening 
495.095	to Mozart makes you smarter
498.052	and improves your 
498.052	performance on I.Q. tests.
500.221	Now again, what's interesting
500.221	about this myth
502.326	is that although it's basically a myth,
502.326	there is a grain of truth to it.
505.767	So the original study found that
507.541	participants who were played
507.541	Mozart music for a few minutes
511.322	did better on a subsequent I.Q. test
513.621	than participants who simply
513.621	sat in silence.
517.034	But a follow-up study recruited
517.034	some people who liked Mozart music
520.758	and then another group of people
522.539	who were fans of 
522.539	the horror stories of Stephen King.
525.207	And they played the people
525.207	the music or the stories.
528.771	The people who preferred
528.771	Mozart music to the stories
531.279	got a bigger I.Q. boost
531.279	from the Mozart than the stories,
534.01	but the people who preferred
534.01	the stories to the Mozart music
536.848	got a bigger I.Q. boost
536.848	from listening to the Stephen King stories
539.955	than the Mozart music.
541.17	So the truth is that listening
541.17	to something that you enjoy
543.933	perks you up a bit
543.933	and gives you a temporary I.Q. boost
547.184	on a narrow range of tasks.
549.111	There's no suggestion that
549.111	listening to Mozart,
551.479	or indeed Stephen King stories,
553.104	is going to make you any smarter
553.104	in the long run.
556.526	Another version of the Mozart myth
559.466	is that listening to Mozart can make you
559.466	not only cleverer but healthier, too.
564.324	Unfortunately, this doesn't
564.324	seem to be true
566.392	of someone who listened
566.392	to the music of Mozart almost every day,
569.451	Mozart himself,
571.169	who suffered from gonorrhea,
571.169	smallpox, arthritis,
574.149	and, what most people think eventually
574.149	killed him in the end, syphilis.
578.673	This suggests that Mozart
578.673	should have bit more careful, perhaps,
582.035	when choosing his sexual partners.
584.613	But how do we choose a partner?
586.772	So a myth that I have to say
586.772	is sometimes spread a bit by sociologists
591.798	is that our preferences in a romantic 
591.798	partner are a product of our culture,
595.421	that they're very culturally specific.
597.352	But in fact, the data don't back this up.
599.496	A famous study surveyed people from
599.496	[37] different cultures across the globe,
603.541	from Americans to Zulus,
605.117	on what they look for in a partner.
607.483	And in every single culture
607.483	across the globe,
609.852	men placed more value
609.852	on physical attractiveness in a partner
613.567	than did women,
614.867	and in every single culture, too,
616.608	women placed more importance than did men
616.608	on ambition and high earning power.
621.222	In every culture, too,
622.605	men preferred women
622.605	who were younger than themselves,
625.13	an average of, I think it was 2.66 years,
627.939	and in every culture, too,
629.588	women preferred men
629.588	who were older than them,
632.188	so an average of 3.42 years,
634.998	which is why we've got here
634.998	"""Everybody needs a Sugar Daddy."""
638.713	So moving on from trying
638.713	to score with a partner
641.29	to trying to score in basketball
641.29	or football or whatever your sport is.
645.212	The myth here is that sportsmen go through
645.212	hot-hand streaks, Americans call them,
649.353	or purple patches,
649.353	we sometimes say in England,
651.553	where they just can't miss,
651.553	like this guy here.
654.393	But in fact, what happens is that
654.393	if you analyze the pattern
658.077	of hits and misses statistically,
659.865	it turns out that it's
659.865	nearly always at random.
662.164	Your brain creates patterns
662.164	from the randomness.
664.579	If you toss a coin,
665.936	a streak of heads or tails is going 
665.936	to come out somewhere in the randomness,
669.572	and because the brain likes to see
669.572	patterns where there are none,
672.683	we look at these streaks
672.683	and attribute meanings to them
675.284	"and say, ""Yeah he's really on form today,"""
677.591	whereas actually you would
677.591	get the same pattern
679.901	if you were just getting
679.901	hits and misses at random.
683.406	So an exception to this, however,
683.406	is penalty shootouts.
686.872	A recent study looking
686.872	at penalty shootouts in football
689.957	shows that players who represent countries
691.977	with a very bad record
691.977	in penalty shootouts,
694.601	like, for example, England,
696.784	tend to be quicker to take their shots
696.784	than countries with a better record,
700.545	and presumably as a result,
700.545	they're more likely to miss.
703.865	Which raises the question
705.56	of if there's any way that we
705.56	could improve people's performance.
708.949	And one thing you might think about doing
710.947	is punishing people for their misses
710.947	and seeing if that improves them.
714.366	This idea, the effect that punishment
714.366	can improve performance,
717.998	is what participants
717.998	thought they were testing
720.204	in Milgram's famous learning
720.204	and punishment experiment
722.736	that you've probably heard about
722.736	if you're a psychology student.
725.744	The story goes that participants
725.744	were prepared to give
728.566	what they believed to be fatal
728.566	electric shocks to a fellow participant
731.867	when they got a question wrong,
733.888	just because someone
733.888	in a white coat told them to.
736.697	But this story is a myth
736.697	for three reasons.
739.112	Firstly and most crucially, the lab coat
739.112	wasn't white, it was in fact grey.
744.016	Secondly, the participants
744.016	were told before the study
748.423	and reminded any time
748.423	they raised a concern,
750.93	that although the shocks were painful,
750.93	they were not fatal
753.763	and indeed caused
753.763	no permanent damage whatsoever.
756.505	And thirdly, participants
756.505	didn't give the shocks
758.825	just because someone
758.825	in the coat told them to.
761.473	When they were interviewed
761.473	after the study,
763.515	all the participants said
763.515	that they firmly believed
766.023	that the learning and punishment study
766.023	served a worthy scientific purpose
769.807	which would have
769.807	enduring gains for science
772.245	as opposed to the momentary nonfatal
772.245	discomfort caused to the participants.
779.025	Okay, so I've been talking
779.025	for about 12 minutes now,
781.603	and you've probably been 
781.603	sitting there listening to me,
784.289	analyzing my speech patterns 
784.289	and body language
786.509	and trying to work out if you should
786.509	take any notice of what I'm saying,
790.116	whether I'm telling the truth
790.116	or whether I'm lying,
792.577	but if so you've
792.577	probably completely failed,
794.759	because although we all think
794.759	we can catch a liar
797.104	from their body language
797.104	and speech patterns,
799.197	hundreds of psychological tests
799.197	over the years have shown
801.87	that all of us, including
801.87	police officers and detectives,
804.561	are basically at chance when it comes
804.561	to detecting lies from body language
808.061	and verbal patterns.
809.642	Interestingly, there is one exception:
811.686	TV appeals for missing relatives.
813.938	It's quite easy to predict
813.938	when the relatives are missing
816.923	and when the appealers have in fact
816.923	murdered the relatives themselves.
820.254	So hoax appealers are more likely
820.254	to shake their heads, to look away,
823.769	and to make errors in their speech,
825.483	whereas genuine appealers are more likely
827.498	to express hope that the person
827.498	will return safely
829.843	and to avoid brutal language.
831.584	So, for example, they might say
831.584	"""taken from us"" rather than ""killed."""
836.187	Speaking of which,
836.187	it's about time I killed this talk,
838.844	but before I do, I just want 
838.844	to give you in 30 seconds
842.052	the overarching myth of psychology.
845.423	So the myth is that psychology is just
845.423	a collection of interesting theories,
849.72	all of which say something useful
849.72	and all of which have something to offer.
853.241	What I hope to have shown you
853.241	in the past few minutes
855.74	is that this isn't true.
857.325	What we need to do is assess
857.325	psychological theories
860.584	by seeing what predictions they make,
862.468	whether that is that listening to Mozart
862.468	makes you smarter,
865.289	that you learn better when information is
865.289	presented in your preferred learning style
870.056	or whatever it is, all of these
870.056	are testable empirical predictions,
873.521	and the only way we can make progress
875.306	is to test these predictions
875.306	against the data
877.426	in tightly controlled
877.426	experimental studies.
879.755	And it's only by doing so
879.755	that we can hope to discover
882.889	which of these theories
882.889	are well supported,
885.513	and which, like all the ones
885.513	I've told you about today, are myths.
888.903	Thank you.
890.412	(Applause)
