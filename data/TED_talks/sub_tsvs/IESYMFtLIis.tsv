18.33	I think all of us have been interested, at one time or another,
22.33	in the romantic mysteries of all those societies that collapsed,
27.33	such as the classic Maya in the Yucatan, the Easter Islanders,
32.33	the Anasazi, Fertile Crescent society, Angor Wat, Great Zimbabwe
36.33	and so on. And within the last decade or two,
40.33	archaeologists have shown us that there were environmental problems
44.33	underlying many of these past collapses.
47.33	But there were also plenty of places in the world
48.33	where societies have been developing for thousands of years
52.33	without any sign of a major collapse,
54.33	such as Japan, Java, Tonga and Tikopea. So evidently, societies
60.33	in some areas are more fragile than in other areas.
63.33	How can we understand what makes some societies more fragile
66.33	than other societies? The problem is obviously relevant
72.33	to our situation today, because today as well, there are
75.33	some societies that have already collapsed, such as Somalia
79.33	and Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. There are also
82.33	societies today that may be close to collapse, such as Nepal, Indonesia and Columbia.
87.33	What about ourselves?
90.33	What is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid
96.33	declining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have?
101.33	Obviously the answer to this question is not going
103.33	to be a single factor. If anyone tells you that there is a single-factor
107.33	explanation for societal collapses, you know right away
110.33	that they're an idiot. This is a complex subject.
114.33	But how can we make sense out of the complexities of this subject?
118.33	In analyzing societal collapses, I've arrived at a
121.33	five-point framework -- a checklist of things that I go through
125.33	to try and understand collapses. And I'll illustrate that five-point
130.33	framework by the extinction of the Greenland Norse society.
135.33	This is a European society with literate records,
138.33	so we know a good deal about the people and their motivation.
142.33	In AD 984 Vikings went out to Greenland, settled Greenland,
146.33	and around 1450 they died out -- the society collapsed,
150.33	and every one of them ended up dead.
152.33	Why did they all end up dead? Well, in my five-point framework,
156.33	the first item on the framework is to look for human impacts
160.33	on the environment: people inadvertently destroying the resource
163.33	base on which they depend. And in the case of the Viking Norse,
168.33	the Vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation,
173.33	which was a particular problem for them because
176.33	they required forests to make charcoal, to make iron.
179.33	So they ended up an Iron Age European society, virtually
183.33	unable to make their own iron. A second item on my checklist is
188.33	climate change. Climate can get warmer or colder or dryer or wetter.
194.33	In the case of the Vikings -- in Greenland, the climate got colder
198.33	in the late 1300s, and especially in the 1400s. But a cold climate
202.33	isn't necessarily fatal, because the Inuit -- the Eskimos inhabiting
207.33	Greenland at the same time -- did better, rather than worse,
209.33	with cold climates. So why didn't the Greenland Norse as well?
213.33	The third thing on my checklist is relations with neighboring
217.33	friendly societies that may prop up a society. And if that
221.33	friendly support is pulled away, that may make a society
224.33	more likely to collapse. In the case of the Greenland Norse,
228.33	they had trade with the mother country -- Norway --
230.33	and that trade dwindled: partly because Norway got weaker,
234.33	partly because of sea ice between Greenland and Norway.
239.33	The fourth item on my checklist is relations with hostile societies.
245.33	In the case of Norse Greenland, the hostiles were the Inuit --
248.33	the Eskimos sharing Greenland -- with whom the Norse
252.33	got off to bad relationships. And we know that the Inuit
256.33	killed the Norse and, probably of greater importance,
259.33	may have blocked access to the outer fjords, on which
263.33	the Norse depended for seals at a critical time of the year.
267.33	And then finally, the fifth item on my checklist is the political,
271.33	economic, social and cultural factors in the society that make it
275.33	more or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its
279.33	environmental problems. In the case of the Greenland Norse,
284.33	cultural factors that made it difficult for them
286.33	to solve their problems were: their commitments to a
289.33	Christian society investing heavily in cathedrals; their being
293.33	a competitive-ranked chiefly society; and their scorn for the Inuit,
299.33	from whom they refused to learn. So that's how the five-part
302.33	framework is relevant to the collapse and eventual extinction of the Greenland Norse.
307.33	What about a society today?
310.33	For the past five years, I've been taking my wife and kids to
314.33	Southwestern Montana, where I worked as a teenager
317.33	on the hay harvest. And Montana, at first sight, seems
321.33	like the most pristine environment in the United States.
324.33	But scratch the surface, and Montana suffers from serious problems.
329.33	Going through the same checklist: human environmental impacts?
333.33	Yes, acute in Montana. Toxic problems from mine waste
338.33	have caused damage of billions of dollars.
341.33	Problems from weeds, weed control, cost Montana nearly
348.33	from salinization, problems of forest management,
352.33	problems of forest fires. Second item on my checklist:
356.33	climate change. Yes -- the climate in Montana is getting warmer
359.33	and drier, but Montana agriculture depends especially on irrigation
363.33	from the snow pack, and as the snow is melting -- for example,
367.33	as the glaciers in Glacier National Park are disappearing --
370.33	that's bad news for Montana irrigation agriculture.
374.33	Third thing on my checklist: relations with friendlies
376.33	that can sustain the society. In Montana today, more than half of
380.33	the income of Montana is not earned within Montana,
384.33	but is derived from out of state: transfer payments from
387.33	social security, investments and so on --
390.33	which makes Montana vulnerable to the rest of the United States.
394.33	Fourth: relations with hostiles. Montanans have the same problems
398.33	as do all Americans, in being sensitive to problems
402.33	created by hostiles overseas affecting our oil supplies,
406.33	and terrorist attacks. And finally, last item on my checklist:
412.33	question of how political, economic, social, cultural attitudes
415.33	play into this. Montanans have long-held values, which today
420.33	seem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems.
423.33	Long-held devotion to logging and to mines and to agriculture,
427.33	and to no government regulation; values that worked well
431.33	in the past, but they don't seem to be working well today.
435.33	So, I'm looking at these issues of collapses
437.33	for a lot of past societies and for many present societies.
442.33	Are there any general conclusions that arise?
444.33	In a way, just like Tolstoy's statement about every unhappy marriage
449.33	being different, every collapsed or endangered society is different --
452.33	they all have different details. But nevertheless, there are certain
456.33	common threads that emerge from these comparisons
459.33	of past societies that did or did not collapse
462.33	and threatened societies today. One interesting common thread
469.33	has to do with, in many cases, the rapidity of collapse
473.33	after a society reaches its peak. There are many societies
477.33	that don't wind down gradually, but they build up -- get richer
480.33	and more powerful -- and then within a short time, within a few decades
484.33	after their peak, they collapse. For example,
486.33	the classic lowland Maya of the Yucatan began to collapse in the
492.33	early 800s -- literally a few decades after the Maya were building
495.33	their biggest monuments, and Maya population was greatest.
500.33	Or again, the collapse of the Soviet Union took place
503.33	within a couple of decades, maybe within a decade, of the time
507.33	when the Soviet Union was at its greatest power.
510.33	An analogue would be the growth of bacteria in a petri dish.
515.33	These rapid collapses are especially likely where there's
518.33	a mismatch between available resources and resource consumption,
523.33	or a mismatch between economic outlays and economic potential.
527.33	In a petri dish, bacteria grow. Say they double every generation,
532.33	and five generations before the end the petri dish is 15/16ths empty,
537.33	and then the next generation's 3/4ths empty, and the next generation
541.33	half empty. Within one generation after the petri dish still
545.33	being half empty, it is full. There's no more food and the bacteria have collapsed.
550.33	So, this is a frequent theme:
552.33	societies collapse very soon after reaching their peak in power.
557.33	What it means to put it mathematically is that, if you're concerned
559.33	about a society today, you should be looking not at the value
564.33	of the mathematical function -- the wealth itself -- but you should
567.33	be looking at the first derivative and the second derivatives
570.33	of the function. That's one general theme. A second general theme
575.33	is that there are many, often subtle environmental factors that make
580.33	some societies more fragile than others. Many of those factors
584.33	are not well understood. For example, why is it that in the Pacific,
588.33	of those hundreds of Pacific islands, why did Easter Island end up as
592.33	the most devastating case of complete deforestation?
596.33	It turns out that there were about nine different environmental
599.33	factors -- some, rather subtle ones -- that were working against
603.33	the Easter Islanders, and they involve fallout of volcanic tephra,
608.33	latitude, rainfall. Perhaps the most subtle of them
611.33	is that it turns out that a major input of nutrients
614.33	which protects island environments in the Pacific is from
618.33	the fallout of continental dust from central Asia.
621.33	Easter, of all Pacific islands, has the least input of dust
625.33	from Asia restoring the fertility of its soils. But that's
629.33	a factor that we didn't even appreciate until 1999.
634.33	So, some societies, for subtle environmental reasons,
636.33	are more fragile than others. And then finally,
639.33	another generalization. I'm now teaching a course
642.33	at UCLA, to UCLA undergraduates, on these collapses
645.33	of societies. What really bugs my UCLA undergraduate students is,
649.33	how on earth did these societies not see what they were doing?
652.33	How could the Easter Islanders have deforested their environment?
655.33	What did they say when they were cutting down the last palm tree?
659.33	Didn't they see what they were doing? How could societies
662.33	not perceive their impacts on the environments and stop in time?
667.33	And I would expect that, if our human civilization carries on,
674.33	then maybe in the next century people will be asking,
677.33	why on earth did these people today in the year 2003 not see
681.33	the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action?
685.33	It seems incredible in the past. In the future, it'll seem
688.33	incredible what we are doing today. And so I've been
691.33	trying to develop a hierarchical set of considerations
696.33	about why societies fail to solve their problems --
700.33	why they fail to perceive the problems or, if they perceive them,
702.33	why they fail to tackle them. Or, if they tackle them,
705.33	why do they fail to succeed in solving them?
708.33	I'll just mention two generalizations in this area.
712.33	One blueprint for trouble, making collapse likely,
715.33	is where there is a conflict of interest between the short-term
718.33	interest of the decision-making elites and the long-term
722.33	interest of the society as a whole, especially if the elites
726.33	are able to insulate themselves from the consequences
728.33	of their actions. Where what's good in the short run for the elite
732.33	is bad for the society as a whole, there's a real risk of the elite
736.33	doing things that would bring the society down in the long run.
739.33	For example, among the Greenland Norse --
741.33	a competitive rank society -- what the chiefs really wanted
744.33	is more followers and more sheep and more resources
747.33	to outcompete the neighboring chiefs. And that led the chiefs
750.33	to do what's called flogging the land: overstocking the land,
754.33	forcing tenant farmers into dependency. And that made
758.33	the chiefs powerful in the short run,
762.33	but led to the society's collapse in the long run.
766.33	Those same issues of conflicts of interest are acute
769.33	in the United States today. Especially because
772.33	the decision makers in the United States are frequently
776.33	able to insulate themselves from consequences
779.33	by living in gated compounds, by drinking bottled water
782.33	and so on. And within the last couple of years,
785.33	it's been obvious that the elite in the business world
789.33	correctly perceive that they can advance
791.33	their short-term interest by doing things that are
794.33	good for them but bad for society as a whole,
796.33	such as draining a few billion dollars out of Enron
799.33	and other businesses. They are quite correct
803.33	that these things are good for them in the short term,
806.33	although bad for society in the long term.
809.33	So, that's one general conclusion about why societies
812.33	make bad decisions: conflicts of interest.
816.33	And the other generalization that I want to mention
820.33	is that it's particularly hard for a society to make
822.33	quote-unquote good decisions when there is a conflict involving
828.33	strongly held values that are good in many circumstances
833.33	but are poor in other circumstances. For example,
836.33	the Greenland Norse, in this difficult environment,
839.33	were held together for four-and-a-half centuries
842.33	by their shared commitment to religion,
845.33	and by their strong social cohesion. But those two things --
849.33	commitment to religion and strong social cohesion --
852.33	also made it difficult for them to change at the end
855.33	and to learn from the Inuit. Or today -- Australia.
858.33	One of the things that enabled Australia to survive
861.33	in this remote outpost of European civilization
864.33	for 250 years has been their British identity.
868.33	But today, their commitment to a British identity
872.33	is serving Australians poorly in their need to adapt
875.33	to their situation in Asia. So it's particularly difficult
879.33	to change course when the things that get you in trouble
883.33	are the things that are also the source of your strength.
887.33	What's going to be the outcome today?
889.33	Well, all of us know the dozen sorts of ticking time bombs
895.33	going on in the modern world, time bombs that have fuses
901.33	of a few decades to -- all of them, not more than 50 years,
905.33	and any one of which can do us in; the time bombs of water,
910.33	of soil, of climate change, invasive species,
914.33	the photosynthetic ceiling, population problems, toxics, etc., etc. --
919.33	listing about 12 of them. And while these time bombs --
923.33	none of them has a fuse beyond 50 years, and most of them
925.33	have fuses of a few decades -- some of them, in some places,
928.33	have much shorter fuses. At the rate at which we're going now,
932.33	the Philippines will lose all its accessible loggable forest
936.33	within five years. And the Solomon Islands are only
939.33	one year away from losing their loggable forest,
942.33	which is their major export. And that's going to be spectacular
944.33	for the economy of the Solomons. People often ask me,
948.33	Jared, what's the most important thing that we need to do
951.33	about the world's environmental problems?
953.33	And my answer is, the most important thing we need to do
955.33	is to forget about there being any single thing that is
958.33	the most important thing we need to do.
960.33	Instead, there are a dozen things, any one of which could do us in.
963.33	And we've got to get them all right, because if we solve 11,
966.33	we fail to solve the 12th -- we're in trouble. For example,
969.33	if we solve our problems of water and soil and population,
972.33	but don't solve our problems of toxics, then we are in trouble.
978.33	The fact is that our present course is a non-sustainable course,
983.33	which means, by definition, that it cannot be maintained.
987.33	And the outcome is going to get resolved within a few decades.
994.33	That means that those of us in this room who are less than
1001.33	and those of us who are over the age of 60 may not see
1004.33	the resolution, but our children and grandchildren certainly will.
1008.33	The resolution is going to achieve either of two forms:
1011.33	either we will resolve these non-sustainable time-fuses
1016.33	in pleasant ways of our own choice by taking remedial action,
1021.33	or else these conflicts are going to get settled
1024.33	in unpleasant ways not of our choice -- namely, by war,
1028.33	disease or starvation. But what's for sure is that our
1032.33	non-sustainable course will get resolved in one way or another
1034.33	in a few decades. In other words, since the theme of this session
1038.33	is choices, we have a choice. Does that mean that we should
1043.33	get pessimistic and overwhelmed? I draw the reverse conclusion.
1048.33	The big problems facing the world today are not at all
1051.33	things beyond our control. Our biggest threat is not an asteroid
1055.33	about to crash into us, something we can do nothing about.
1059.33	Instead, all the major threats facing us today are problems
1062.33	entirely of our own making. And since we made the problems,
1066.33	we can also solve the problems. That then means that it's
1070.33	entirely in our power to deal with these problems.
1074.33	In particular, what can all of us do? For those of you
1077.33	who are interested in these choices, there are lots of things
1080.33	you can do. There's a lot that we don't understand,
1084.33	and that we need to understand. And there's a lot that
1087.33	we already do understand, but aren't doing, and that
1091.33	we need to be doing. Thank you.
1093.33	(Applause)
