26	"In 1962, with Rachel Carson's ""Silent Spring,"""
30	I think for people like me in the world of the making of things,
35	the canary in the mine wasn't singing.
39	And so the question that we might not have birds
42	became kind of fundamental to those of us wandering around
45	looking for the meadowlarks that seemed to have all disappeared.
48	And the question was, were the birds singing?
51	Now, I'm not a scientist, that'll be really clear.
55	But, you know, we've just come from this discussion of what a bird might be.
59	What is a bird?
60	Well, in my world, this is a rubber duck.
64	It comes in California with a warning --
66	"""This product contains chemicals known by the State of California"
69	"to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm."""
76	This is a bird.
79	What kind of culture would produce a product of this kind
82	and then label it and sell it to children?
87	I think we have a design problem.
90	Someone heard the six hours of talk that I gave
95	"called ""The Monticello Dialogues"" on NPR, and sent me this as a thank you note --"
101	"""We realize that design is a signal of intention,"
103	but it also has to occur within a world,
106	and we have to understand that world in order to
110	imbue our designs with inherent intelligence,
113	and so as we look back at the basic state of affairs
118	in which we design, we, in a way, need to go to the primordial condition
123	to understand the operating system and the frame conditions of a planet,
128	and I think the exciting part of that is the good news that's there,
133	because the news is the news of abundance,
136	and not the news of limits,
138	and I think as our culture tortures itself now
143	with tyrannies and concerns over limits and fear,
148	we can add this other dimension of abundance that is coherent,
153	driven by the sun, and start to imagine
155	"what that would be like to share."""
162	That was a nice thing to get.
164	That was one sentence.
168	Henry James would be proud.
170	This is -- I put it down at the bottom,
172	but that was extemporaneous, obviously.
175	The fundamental issue is that, for me,
178	design is the first signal of human intentions.
180	So what are our intentions, and what would our intentions be --
184	if we wake up in the morning, we have designs on the world --
187	well, what would our intention be as a species
189	now that we're the dominant species?
191	And it's not just stewardship and dominion debate,
194	because really, dominion is implicit in stewardship --
200	because how could you dominate something you had killed?
202	And stewardship's implicit in dominion,
204	because you can't be steward of something if you can't dominate it.
206	So the question is, what is the first question for designers?
212	Now, as guardians -- let's say the state, for example,
215	which reserves the right to kill, the right to be duplicitous and so on --
220	the question we're asking the guardian at this point is
223	are we meant, how are we meant,
225	to secure local societies, create world peace
227	and save the environment?
229	But I don't know that that's the common debate.
232	Commerce, on the other hand, is relatively quick,
236	essentially creative, highly effective and efficient,
238	and fundamentally honest, because we can't exchange
241	value for very long if we don't trust each other.
245	So we use the tools of commerce primarily for our work,
247	but the question we bring to it is,
249	how do we love all the children of all species for all time?
253	And so we start our designs with that question.
256	Because what we realize today is that modern culture
258	appears to have adopted a strategy of tragedy.
261	"If we come here and say, ""Well, I didn't intend"
263	"to cause global warming on the way here,"""
264	"and we say, ""That's not part of my plan,"""
266	then we realize it's part of our de facto plan.
269	Because it's the thing that's happening because we have no other plan.
272	And I was at the White House for President Bush,
274	meeting with every federal department and agency,
276	and I pointed out that they appear to have no plan.
280	If the end game is global warming, they're doing great.
282	If the end game is mercury toxification of our children
285	downwind of coal fire plants as they scuttled the Clean Air Act,
288	then I see that our education programs should be explicitly defined as,
292	"""Brain death for all children. No child left behind."""
294	(Applause)
298	So, the question is, how many federal officials
302	are ready to move to Ohio and Pennsylvania with their families?
305	So if you don't have an endgame of something delightful,
309	then you're just moving chess pieces around,
311	if you don't know you're taking the king.
312	So perhaps we could develop a strategy of change,
315	which requires humility. And in my business as an architect,
318	"it's unfortunate the word ""humility"" and the word ""architect"""
322	"have not appeared in the same paragraph since ""The Fountainhead."""
325	So if anybody here has trouble with the concept of design humility,
330	reflect on this -- it took us 5,000 years
333	to put wheels on our luggage.
337	So, as Kevin Kelly pointed out, there is no endgame.
342	There is an infinite game, and we're playing in that infinite game.
346	"And so we call it ""cradle to cradle,"""
348	and our goal is very simple.
349	This is what I presented to the White House.
351	Our goal is a delightfully diverse, safe, healthy and just world,
354	with clean air, clean water, soil and power --
357	economically, equitably, ecologically and elegantly enjoyed, period.
361	(Applause)
364	What don't you like about this?
367	Which part of this don't you like?
369	So we realized we want full diversity,
371	even though it can be difficult to remember what De Gaulle said
374	when asked what it was like to be President of France.
376	"He said, ""What do you think it's like trying to run a country with 400 kinds of cheese?"""
380	But at the same time, we realize that our products are not safe and healthy.
383	So we've designed products
385	and we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million.
387	This is a baby blanket by Pendleton that will give your child nutrition
390	instead of Alzheimer's later in life.
392	We can ask ourselves, what is justice,
394	and is justice blind, or is justice blindness?
398	And at what point did that uniform turn from white to black?
403	Water has been declared a human right by the United Nations.
406	Air quality is an obvious thing to anyone who breathes.
408	Is there anybody here who doesn't breathe?
411	Clean soil is a critical problem -- the nitrification, the dead zones
414	in the Gulf of Mexico.
416	A fundamental issue that's not being addressed.
418	We've seen the first form of solar energy
420	that's beat the hegemony of fossil fuels in the form of wind
423	here in the Great Plains, and so that hegemony is leaving.
426	And if we remember Sheikh Yamani when he formed OPEC,
429	"they asked him, ""When will we see the end of the age of oil?"""
432	I don't know if you remember his answer, but it was,
435	"""The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones."""
439	We see that companies acting ethically in this world
443	are outperforming those that don't.
444	We see the flows of materials in a rather terrifying prospect.
449	This is a hospital monitor from Los Angeles, sent to China.
452	This woman will expose herself to toxic phosphorous,
455	release four pounds of toxic lead into her childrens' environment,
458	which is from copper.
460	On the other hand, we see great signs of hope.
462	Here's Dr. Venkataswamy in India, who's figured out
465	how to do mass-produced health.
467	He has given eyesight to two million people for free.
471	We see in our material flows that car steels don't become car steel again
474	because of the contaminants of the coatings --
476	bismuth, antimony, copper and so on.
478	They become building steel.
479	On the other hand, we're working with Berkshire Hathaway,
481	Warren Buffett and Shaw Carpet,
484	the largest carpet company in the world.
485	We've developed a carpet that is continuously recyclable,
488	down to the parts per million.
491	The upper is Nylon 6 that can go back to caprolactam,
494	the bottom, a polyolephine -- infinitely recyclable thermoplastic.
497	Now if I was a bird, the building on my left is a liability.
501	The building on my right, which is our corporate campus for The Gap
504	with an ancient meadow, is an asset -- its nesting grounds.
509	Here's where I come from. I grew up in Hong Kong,
511	with six million people in 40 square miles.
513	During the dry season, we had four hours of water every fourth day.
517	And the relationship to landscape was that of farmers who have been
520	farming the same piece of ground for 40 centuries.
524	You can't farm the same piece of ground for 40 centuries
526	without understanding nutrient flow.
529	My childhood summers were in the Puget Sound of Washington,
532	among the first growth and big growth.
534	My grandfather had been a lumberjack in the Olympics,
536	so I have a lot of tree karma I am working off.
541	I went to Yale for graduate school,
543	studied in a building of this style by Le Corbusier,
545	affectionately known in our business as Brutalism.
549	If we look at the world of architecture,
552	we see with Mies' 1928 tower for Berlin,
555	"the question might be, ""Well, where's the sun?"""
557	And this might have worked in Berlin, but we built it in Houston,
560	and the windows are all closed. And with most products
563	appearing not to have been designed for indoor use,
565	this is actually a vertical gas chamber.
568	When I went to Yale, we had the first energy crisis,
571	and I was designing the first solar-heated house in Ireland
573	as a student, which I then built --
575	which would give you a sense of my ambition.
577	And Richard Meier, who was one of my teachers,
579	kept coming over to my desk to give me criticism,
581	"and he would say, ""Bill, you've got to understand- --"
583	"solar energy has nothing to do with architecture."""
591	I guess he didn't read Vitruvius.
593	"In 1984, we did the first so-called ""green office"" in America"
597	for Environmental Defense.
598	We started asking manufacturers what were in their materials.
601	"They said, ""They're proprietary, they're legal, go away."""
603	The only indoor quality work done in this country at that time
605	was sponsored by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company,
608	and it was to prove there was no danger
609	from secondhand smoke in the workplace.
612	So, all of a sudden, here I am, graduating from high school in 1969,
616	"and this happens, and we realize that ""away"" went away."
619	Remember we used to throw things away, and we'd point to away?
623	And yet, NOAA has now shown us, for example --
625	you see that little blue thing above Hawaii?
627	That's the Pacific Gyre.
628	It was recently dragged for plankton by scientists,
630	and they found six times as much plastic as plankton.
634	"When asked, they said, ""It's kind of like a giant toilet that doesn't flush."""
639	Perhaps that's away.
640	So we're looking for the design rules of this --
642	this is the highest biodiversity of trees in the world, Irian Jaya,
648	"in the book, ""Cradle to Cradle."""
649	The book itself is a polymer. It is not a tree.
653	"That's the name of the first chapter -- ""This Book is Not a Tree."""
656	Because in poetics, as Margaret Atwood pointed out,
659	"""we write our history on the skin of fish"
661	"with the blood of bears."""
664	And with so much polymer, what we really need
665	is technical nutrition, and to use something
668	as elegant as a tree -- imagine this design assignment:
671	Design something that makes oxygen, sequesters carbon,
673	fixes nitrogen, distills water, accrues solar energy as fuel,
677	makes complex sugars and food, creates microclimates,
681	changes colors with the seasons and self-replicates.
687	Well, why don't we knock that down and write on it?
689	(Laughter)
695	So, we're looking at the same criteria
697	as most people -- you know, can I afford it?
699	Does it work? Do I like it?
701	We're adding the Jeffersonian agenda, and I come from Charlottesville,
703	where I've had the privilege of living in a house designed by Thomas Jefferson.
707	We're adding life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
713	"Now if we look at the word ""competition,"""
714	I'm sure most of you've used it.
716	You know, most people don't realize it comes from
717	the Latin competere, which means strive together.
720	It means the way Olympic athletes train with each other.
723	They get fit together, and then they compete.
726	The Williams sisters compete -- one wins Wimbledon.
728	So we've been looking at the idea of competition
731	as a way of cooperating in order to get fit together.
735	And the Chinese government has now --
736	I work with the Chinese government now --
738	has taken this up.
740	We're also looking at survival of the fittest,
742	not in just competition terms in our modern context
744	of destroy the other or beat them to the ground,
747	but really to fit together and build niches
749	and have growth that is good.
751	Now most environmentalists don't say growth is good,
753	because, in our lexicon, asphalt is two words: assigning blame.
758	But if we look at asphalt as our growth,
761	then we realize that all we're doing is destroying
763	the planetary's fundamental underlying operating system.
767	So when we see E equals mc squared come along, from a poet's perspective,
772	we see energy as physics, chemistry as mass,
774	and all of a sudden, you get this biology.
776	And we have plenty of energy, so we'll solve that problem,
779	but the biology problem's tricky, because as we put through
782	all these toxic materials that we disgorge,
785	we will never be able to recover that.
787	And as Francis Crick pointed out, nine years
789	after discovering DNA with Mr. Watson,
792	that life itself has to have growth as a precondition --
796	it has to have free energy, sunlight
798	and it needs to be an open system of chemicals.
801	So we're asking for human artifice to become a living thing,
804	and we want growth, we want free energy from sunlight
806	and we want an open metabolism for chemicals.
809	Then, the question becomes not growth or no growth,
811	but what do you want to grow?
814	So instead of just growing destruction,
816	we want to grow the things that we might enjoy,
818	and someday the FDA will allow us to make French cheese.
821	So therefore, we have these two metabolisms,
825	and I worked with a German chemist, Michael Braungart,
827	and we've identified the two fundamental metabolisms.
829	The biological one I'm sure you understand,
831	but also the technical one, where we take materials
833	and put them into closed cycles.
835	We call them biological nutrition and technical nutrition.
838	Technical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition.
842	Biological nutrition can supply about 500 million humans,
845	which means that if we all wore Birkenstocks and cotton,
847	the world would run out of cork and dry up.
850	So we need materials in closed cycles,
852	but we need to analyze them down to the parts per million
854	for cancer, birth defects, mutagenic effects,
857	disruption of our immune systems, biodegradation, persistence,
860	heavy metal content, knowledge of how we're making them
863	and their production and so on.
865	Our first product was a textile where we analyzed 8,000 chemicals
869	in the textile industry.
870	Using those intellectual filters, we eliminated [7,962.]
875	We were left with 38 chemicals.
877	We have since databased the 4000 most commonly used chemicals
880	in human manufacturing, and we're releasing this database into the public in six weeks.
885	So designers all over the world can analyze their products
887	down to the parts per million for human and ecological health.
892	(Applause)
897	We've developed a protocol so that companies can send
900	these same messages all the way through their supply chains,
903	because when we asked most companies we work with -- about a trillion dollars
906	"-- and say, ""Where does your stuff come from?"" They say, ""Suppliers."""
908	"""And where does it go?"""
910	"""Customers."""
911	So we need some help there.
912	So the biological nutrients, the first fabrics --
914	the water coming out was clean enough to drink.
916	Technical nutrients -- this is for Shaw Carpet, infinitely reusable carpet.
920	Here's nylon going back to caprolactam back to carpet.
923	Biotechnical nutrients -- the Model U for Ford Motor,
926	a cradle to cradle car -- concept car.
928	Shoes for Nike, where the uppers are polyesters, infinitely recyclable,
932	the bottoms are biodegradable soles.
935	Wear your old shoes in, your new shoes out.
937	There is no finish line.
939	The idea here of the car is that some of the materials
941	go back to the industry forever, some of the materials go back to soil --
944	it's all solar-powered.
946	Here's a building at Oberlin College we designed
948	that makes more energy than it needs to operate and purifies its own water.
952	Here's a building for The Gap, where the ancient grasses
954	of San Bruno, California, are on the roof.
958	And this is our project for Ford Motor Company.
960	It's the revitalization of the River Rouge in Dearborn.
962	This is obviously a color photograph.
966	These are our tools. These are how we sold it to Ford.
970	We saved Ford 35 million dollars doing it this way, day one,
973	which is the equivalent of the Ford Taurus
975	at a four percent margin of an order for 900 million dollars worth of cars.
979	Here it is. It's the world's largest green roof, 10 and a half acres.
982	This is the roof, saving money,
985	and this is the first species to arrive here. These are killdeer.
989	They showed up in five days.
992	And we now have 350-pound auto workers
994	learning bird songs on the Internet.
998	We're developing now protocols for cities --
1000	that's the home of technical nutrients.
1002	The country -- the home of biological. And putting them together.
1005	And so I will finish by showing you a new city
1007	we're designing for the Chinese government.
1009	We're doing 12 cities for China right now,
1012	based on cradle to cradle as templates.
1014	Our assignment is to develop protocols for the housing
1017	for 400 million people in 12 years.
1019	We did a mass energy balance -- if they use brick,
1021	they will lose all their soil and burn all their coal.
1024	They'll have cities with no energy and no food.
1026	We signed a Memorandum of Understanding --
1028	here's Madam Deng Nan, Deng Xiaoping's daughter --
1030	for China to adopt cradle to cradle.
1032	Because if they toxify themselves, being the lowest-cost producer,
1036	send it to the lowest-cost distribution -- Wal-Mart --
1038	and then we send them all our money, what we'll discover is that
1041	we have what, effectively, when I was a student,
1044	was called mutually assured destruction.
1047	Now we do it by molecule. These are our cities.
1050	We're building a new city next to this city; look at that landscape.
1053	This is the site.
1055	We don't normally do green fields, but this one is about to be built,
1059	so they brought us in to intercede.
1061	This is their plan.
1063	It's a rubber stamp grid that they laid right on that landscape.
1066	"And they brought us in and said, ""What would you do?"""
1069	This is what they would end up with, which is another color photograph.
1073	So this is the existing site, so this is what it looks like now,
1076	and here's our proposal.
1078	(Applause)
1082	So the way we approached this
1084	is we studied the hydrology very carefully.
1086	We studied the biota, the ancient biota,
1088	the current farming and the protocols.
1090	We studied the winds and the sun to make sure everybody in the city
1092	will have fresh air, fresh water and direct sunlight
1098	in every single apartment at some point during the day.
1101	We then take the parks and lay them out as ecological infrastructure.
1105	We lay out the building areas.
1108	We start to integrate commercial and mixed use
1109	so the people all have centers and places to be.
1112	The transportation is all very simple,
1114	everybody's within a five-minute walk of mobility.
1117	We have a 24-hour street, so that there's always a place that's alive.
1122	The waste systems all connect.
1124	If you flush a toilet, your feces will go to the sewage treatment plants,
1129	which are sold as assets, not liabilities.
1131	Because who wants the fertilizer factory that makes natural gas?
1135	The waters are all taken in to construct the wetlands for habitat restorations.
1140	And then it makes natural gas, which then goes back into the city
1144	to power the fuel for the cooking for the city.
1148	So this is -- these are fertilizer gas plants.
1150	And then the compost is all taken back
1153	to the roofs of the city, where we've got farming,
1155	because what we've done is lifted up the city,
1159	the landscape, into the air to -- to restore the native landscape
1166	on the roofs of the buildings.
1168	The solar power of all the factory centers
1171	and all the industrial zones with their light roofs powers the city.
1174	And this is the concept for the top of the city.
1176	We've lifted the earth up onto the roofs.
1180	The farmers have little bridges to get from one roof to the next.
1184	We inhabit the city with work/live space on all the ground floors.
1188	And so this is the existing city, and this is the new city.
1193	(Applause)
