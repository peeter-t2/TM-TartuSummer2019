26	Sergey Brin: I want to discuss a question
28	I know that's been pressing on many of your minds.
30	We spoke to you last several years ago.
33	And before I get started today,
35	since many of you are wondering,
38	I just wanted to get it out of the way.
40	The answer is boxers.
52	Now I hope all of you feel better.
54	Do you know what this might be? Does anyone know what that is?
57	Audience: Yes.
58	SB: What is it?
60	Audience: It's people logging on to Google around the world.
62	SB: Wow, OK. I didn't really realize what it was when I first saw it.
65	But this is what helped me see it.
68	This is what we run at the office, that actually runs real time.
71	Here it's slightly logged.
73	But here you can see around the world
75	how people are using Google.
78	And every one of those rising dots
80	represents probably about 20, 30 searches,
83	or something like that.
85	And they're labeled by color right now, by language.
89	So you can see: here we are in the U.S.,
91	and they're all coming up red.
93	There we are in Monterey -- hopefully I can get it right.
95	You can see that Japan is busy at night,
98	right there.
100	We have Tokyo coming in in Japanese.
103	There's a lot of activity in China.
105	There's a lot of activity in India.
108	There's some in the Middle East, the little pockets.
112	And Europe, which is right now in the middle of the day,
115	is going really strong with a whole wide variety of languages.
126	Now you can also see, if I turn this around here --
134	hopefully I won't shake the world too much.
137	But you can also see, there are places where there's not so much.
140	Australia, because there just aren't very many people there.
143	And this is something that we should really work on,
146	which is Africa, which is just a few trickles,
150	basically in South Africa and a few other urban cities.
153	But basically, what we've noticed is these queries,
157	which come in at thousands per second,
159	are available everywhere there is power.
162	And pretty much everywhere there is power, there is the Internet.
166	And even in Antarctica -- well, at least this time of year --
171	we from time to time will see a query rising up.
173	And if we had it plotted correctly,
175	I think the International Space Station would have it, too.
186	So this is
189	some of the challenge that we have here,
193	is you can see that it's actually kind of hard to get the --
202	there we go.
204	This is how we have to move the bits around
205	to actually get the people the answers to their questions.
207	You can see that there's a lot of data running around.
211	It has to go all over the world: through fibers,
214	through satellites, through all kinds of connections.
216	And it's pretty tricky for us to maintain the latencies
221	as low as we try to. Hopefully your experience is good.
225	But you can see also, once again -- so some places are much more wired
227	than others, and you can see all the bandwidth across the U.S.,
231	going up over to Asia, Europe in the other direction, and so forth.
236	Now what I would like to do is just to show you
239	what one second of this activity would look like.
243	And if we can switch to slides --
249	all right, here we go.
251	So this is slowed down.
257	This is what one second looks like.
260	And this is what we spend a lot of our time doing,
262	is just making sure that we can keep up
264	with this kind of traffic load.
270	Now, each one of those queries
272	has an interesting life and tale of its own.
274	I mean, it could be somebody's health,
276	it could be somebody's career, something important to them.
279	And it could potentially be something
283	as important as tomato sauce,
288	or in this case, ketchup.
291	So this is a query that we had --
294	I guess it's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others.
297	You can see that it got started right here.
300	In the U.S. and Spain, it was popular at the same time.
303	But it didn't have quite the same pickup in the U.S.
305	as it did in Spain.
307	And then from Spain, it went to Italy,
309	and then Germany got excited, and maybe right now the U.K. is enjoying it.
313	And so I guess the U.S. finally,
315	finally started to like it, too.
318	And I just wanted to play it for you.
326	Anyway, you can all enjoy it for yourselves --
328	hopefully that search will work.
331	As a part of --
335	you know, part of what we want to do to grow our company
337	is to have more searches.
339	And what that means is we want to have
341	more people who are healthy and educated.
346	More animals, if they start doing searches as well.
350	But partly, we want to make the world a better place,
355	and so one thing that we're embarking upon is the Google Foundation,
360	and we're in the process of setting that up.
362	We also have a program already called Google Grants
365	that now serves over 150 different charities around the world,
368	and these are some of the charities that are on there.
370	And it's something I'm very excited to be a part of.
375	In fact, many of the organizations that are here --
377	the Acumen Fund, I think ApproTEC we have running, I'm not sure if that one's up yet --
383	and many of the people who have presented here are running through Google Grants.
386	They run Google ads, and we just give them the ad credit
389	so they can let organizations know.
393	One of the earlier results that we got --
395	we have a Singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village
398	of 25 Vietnamese girls for their education,
402	and that was one of the earliest results. And as I said, now there have been
405	many, many stories that have come in,
407	because we do have hundreds of charities in there,
409	and the Google Foundation will be an even broader endeavor.
414	Now does anybody know who this is?
420	A-ha!
421	Audience: Orkut.
422	SB: Yes! Somebody got it.
424	This is Orkut. Is anybody here on Orkut?
427	Do we have any?
429	Okay, not very many people know about it.
430	I'll explain it in a second.
432	This is one of our engineers.
434	We find that they work better when they're submerged and covered with leaves.
439	That's how we churn those products out.
442	Orkut had a vision to create a social network.
447	"I know all of you are thinking, ""Yet another social network."""
449	But it was a dream of his, and we, basically,
452	when people really want to do something, well, we generally let them.
455	So this is what he built.
458	We just released it in a test phase last month,
462	and it's been taking off.
464	This is our VP of Engineering.
466	You can see the red hair, and I don't know if you can see the nose ring there.
471	And these are all of his friends.
474	So this is how -- we just deployed it --
481	we just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service,
484	and so we just had the people in our company initially send them out.
489	And now we've grown to over 100,000 members.
493	And they spread, actually, very quickly, even outside the U.S.
496	You can see, even though the U.S. is still the majority here --
499	though, by the way, search-wise, it's only about 30 percent of our traffic --
503	but it's already going to Japan, and the U.K., and Europe,
506	and all the rest of the countries.
508	So it's a fun little project.
510	There are a variety of demographics. I won't bore you with these.
513	But it's just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun
516	and see where it goes.
518	And --
520	well, I'll leave you in suspense.
522	Larry, you can explain this one.
524	Larry Page: Thank you, Sergey.
527	So one of the things -- both Sergey and I
529	went to a Montessori school,
531	and I think, for some reason,
534	this has been incorporated in Google.
537	And Sergey mentioned Orkut, which is something that,
540	you know, Orkut wanted to do in his time,
544	"and we call this -- at Google, we've embodied this as ""the 20 percent time,"""
547	and the idea is, for 20 percent of your time,
550	if you're working at Google, you can do what you think is the best thing to do.
553	And many, many things at Google have come out of that,
557	such as Orkut and also Google News.
560	And I think many other things in the world also have come out of this.
564	Mendel, who was supposed to be teaching high-school students,
567	actually, you know, discovered the laws of genetics --
570	as a hobby, basically.
572	So many, many useful things come out of this.
576	And News, which I just mentioned,
579	was started by a researcher.
582	And he just -- he -- after 9/11, he got really interested in the news.
585	"And he said, ""Why don't I look at the news better?"""
590	And so he started clustering it by category,
593	and then he started using it, and then his friends started using it.
596	And then, besides just looking cute on a baby's bottom,
601	we made it a Googlette,
603	which is basically a small project at Google.
606	So it'd be like three people, or something like that,
609	and they would try to make a product.
611	And we wouldn't really be sure if it's going to work or not.
613	And in News' case, you know, they had a couple of people
617	working on it for a while, and then more and more people
619	started using it, and then we put it out on the Internet,
621	and more and more people started using it.
623	And now it's a real, full-blown project with more people on it.
626	And this is how we keep our innovation running.
629	I think usually, as companies get bigger,
632	they find it really hard to have small, innovative projects.
635	And we had this problem, too, for a while, and we said,
638	"""Oh, we really need a new concept."""
640	You know, the Googlettes -- that's a small project that we're not quite sure if it's going to work or not,
644	but we hope it will, and if we do enough of them,
647	some of them will really work and turn out, such as News.
651	But then we had a problem because then we had over 100 projects.
655	And I don't know about all of you,
657	but I have trouble keeping 100 things in my head at once.
660	And we found that if we just wrote all of them down
664	and ordered them -- and these are kind of made up.
667	Don't really pay attention to them.
669	"For example, the ""Buy Iceland"" was from a media article."
672	We would never do such a crazy thing, but --
677	in any case, we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them,
681	that most people would actually agree what the ordering should be.
685	And this was kind of a surprise to me, but
687	we found that as long as you keep the 100 things in your head,
690	which you did by writing them down,
692	that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do
694	and where to put your resources.
697	And so that's basically what we've done
699	since we instituted that a few years ago, and I think it has really allowed us to be innovative
703	and still stay reasonably well-organized.
706	The other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important,
709	and so naturally,
711	people sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities.
717	I just wanted to highlight a couple of things
719	that are new, or you might not know about.
722	And the top thing, actually, is the Deskbar.
725	So this is a new -- how many of you use the Google Toolbar?
728	Raise your hands.
730	How many of you use the Deskbar?
733	All right, see? You guys should try it out.
735	But if you go to our site and search
737	"for ""Deskbar,"" you'll get this."
739	And the idea is, instead of a toolbar, it's just present all the time
741	on your screen on the bottom,
743	and you can do searches really easily.
746	And it's sort of like a better version of the toolbar.
748	Thank you, Sergey.
754	This is another example of a project that somebody at Google
756	was really passionate about, and they just, they got going,
759	and it's really, really a great product, and really taking off.
762	Google Answers is something we started, which is really cool,
766	which lets you -- for five to 100 dollars,
769	you can type a question in,
771	and then there's a pool of researchers
773	that go out and research it for you, and it's guaranteed and all that,
777	and you can get actually very good answers to things
779	without spending all that time yourself.
781	Froogle lets you search shopping information,
784	and Blogger lets you publish things.
786	But all of these -- well, these were all sort of innovative things that we did that --
790	you know, we try many, many different things
793	in our company.
794	We also like to innovate in our physical space,
796	and we noticed in meetings, you know, you have to wait a long time
799	for projectors to turn on and off,
802	and they're noisy, so people shut them off.
804	And we didn't like that, so we actually,
806	in maybe a couple of weeks, we built these little enclosures
811	that enclosed the projectors, and so we can leave them on all the time
813	and they're completely silent.
816	And as a result, we were able to build some software
818	that also lets us manage a meeting,
820	so when you walk into a meeting room now,
822	it lists all the meetings that are happening,
824	you can very easily take notes, and they just get emailed automatically
826	to all the people that were present in the meeting.
829	And as we become more of a global company,
832	we find these things really affect us --
834	you know, can we work effectively with people who aren't in the room?
837	And things like that. And simple things like this can really make a big difference.
841	We also have a lot of engineers in those meetings,
846	and they don't always do their laundry as much as they should.
853	And so we found it was pretty helpful
855	to have laundry machines, for our younger employees especially, and ...
862	we also allow dogs and things like that,
865	and we've had, I think, a really fun culture at our company,
868	which helps people work and enjoy what they're doing.
871	"This is actually our ""cult picture."""
873	I just wanted to show quickly.
878	We had this on our website for a while,
880	but we found that after we put it on our website,
883	we didn't get any job applications anymore.
888	But anyway, every year we've taken
890	the whole company on a ski trip.
892	A lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other, and informally.
896	And I think we've done a good job encouraging that.
900	It makes it a really fun place to work.
902	Along with our logos, too, which I think really embody
905	our culture when we change things.
908	In the early days, we were actually advised
909	we should never change our logo because
913	we should establish our brand, you know,
915	because, you know, you'd never want to change your logo.
917	You want it to be consistent.
919	"And we said, ""Well, that doesn't sound so much fun."
921	"Why don't we try changing it every day?"""
926	One of the things that really excites me about what we're doing now
929	is we have this thing called AdSense,
931	and this is a little bit foreshadowing --
935	this is from before Dean dropped out.
938	But the idea is, like, on a newspaper, for example,
940	we show you relevant ads.
942	"And this is hard to read, but this says ""Battle for New Hampshire:"
944	"Howard Dean for President"" -- articles on Howard Dean."
948	And these ads are generated automatically --
951	like in this case, on the Washington Post --
952	from the content on the site.
954	And so we use our over 150,000 advertisers
958	and millions of advertisements, so we pick the one
960	that's most relevant to what you're actually looking at,
962	much as we do on search.
964	So the idea is we can make advertising useful,
967	not just annoying, right?
969	And the nice thing about this,
971	we have a self-serve program,
973	and many thousands of websites have signed up,
976	and this let's them really make money. And I --
978	you know, there's a number of people I met --
980	I met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party,
983	"and he said, ""You know, I wasn't making any money."
985	I just put this thing on my site and I'm making 10,000 dollars a month.
989	And, you know, thank you.
991	"I don't have to do my other job now."""
993	And I think this is really important for us, because it makes the Internet work better.
996	It makes content get better, it makes searching work better,
999	when people can really make their livelihood
1001	from producing great content.
1006	So this session is supposed to be about the future,
1009	so I'd thought I'd talk at least briefly about it.
1012	And the idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search,
1015	you really have to be smart.
1017	Because you can type, you know, any kind of thing into Google,
1020	and you expect an answer back, right?
1023	But finding things is tricky, and so you really want intelligence.
1027	And in fact, the ultimate search engine would be smart.
1030	It would be artificial intelligence.
1032	And so that's something we work on,
1034	and we even have some people who are excited enough
1036	and crazy enough to work on it now,
1038	and that's really their goal.
1040	So we always hope that Google will be smart,
1042	but we're always surprised when other people think that it is.
1045	And so I just wanted to give a funny example of this.
1048	This is a blog from Iraq,
1050	and it's not really what
1052	I'm going to talk about, but I just wanted to show you an example.
1054	Maybe, Sergey, you can highlight this.
1056	So we decided --
1062	actually, the highlight's right there. Oh, thank you.
1067	"So, ""related searches,"" right there. You can't see it that well,"
1072	but we decided we should put in this feature
1074	"into our AdSense ads, called ""related searches."""
1077	"And so we'd say, you know, ""Did you mean 'search for'"" -- what is this,"
1080	"in this case, ""Saddam Hussein,"" because this blog is about Iraq --"
1083	and you know, in addition to the ads,
1085	and we thought this would be a great idea.
1088	And so there is this blog
1090	of a young person who was kind of depressed, and he said,
1095	"""You know, I'm sleeping a lot."""
1097	He was just kind of writing about his life.
1099	And our algorithms -- not a person, of course,
1102	but our algorithms, our computers --
1104	read his blog and decided that
1106	"the related search was, ""I am bored."""
1108	And he read this, and he thought a person had decided
1111	that he was boring,
1113	and it was very unfortunate,
1116	"and he said, ""You know, what are these, you know, bastards at Google doing?"
1120	"Why don't they like my blog?"""
1122	And so then we read his blog, which was getting -- you know,
1125	sort of going from bad to worse,
1128	"and we said the related search was, ""Retards."""
1133	And then, you know, he got even more mad,
1135	and he wrote -- like, started swearing and so on.
1137	"And then we produced ""You suck."""
1140	"And finally, it ended with ""Kiss my ass."""
1145	And so basically, he thought he was dealing with something smart,
1147	and of course, you know,
1149	we just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out,
1151	and it didn't quite work,
1154	and we don't have this feature anymore.
1158	So with that, maybe I can switch back to the world.
1161	I wanted to end just by saying that
1163	there's a couple things that really make me excited
1165	to be involved with Google,
1168	and one of those is that we're able to make money
1172	largely through advertising, and one of the benefits that I didn't expect from that
1175	was that we're able to serve everyone in the world
1178	without worrying about, you know, places that don't have as much money.
1183	So we don't have to worry about our products being sold,
1186	for example, for less money in places that are poor,
1189	and then they get re-imported into the U.S. --
1191	for example, with the drug industry.
1193	And I think we're really lucky to have that kind of business model
1196	because everyone in the world has access to our search,
1199	and I think that's a tremendous, tremendous benefit.
1202	The other thing I wanted to mention just briefly
1205	is that we have a tremendous ability and responsibility
1211	to provide people the right information,
1214	and we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine --
1216	that we should provide very objective information.
1219	And so in our search results, we never accept payment for our search results.
1222	We accept payment for advertising,
1225	and we mark it as such.
1227	And that's unlike many of our competitors.
1229	And I think decisions we're able to make like that
1232	have a tremendous impact on the world,
1234	and it makes me really proud to be involved with Google.
1236	So thank you.
