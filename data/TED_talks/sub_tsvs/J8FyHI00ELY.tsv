16.168	I'd like to talk about my dad.
17.76	My dad has Alzheimer's disease.
20.336	He started showing the symptoms about 12 years ago,
23.896	and he was officially diagnosed in 2005.
27.283	Now he's really pretty sick. He needs help eating,
31.608	he needs help getting dressed, he doesn't really know where he is
35.496	or when it is, and it's been really, really hard.
39.36	My dad was my hero and my mentor for most of my life,
42.872	and I've spent the last decade watching him disappear.
46.4	My dad's not alone. There's about 35 million people globally living with some kind of dementia,
54.537	and by 2030 they're expecting that to double to 70 million.
59.186	That's a lot of people.
61.336	Dementia scares us. The confused faces and shaky hands of people who have dementia,
67.952	the big numbers of people who get it, they frighten us.
71.8	And because of that fear, we tend to do one of two things:
75.545	"We go into denial: ""It's not me, it has nothing to do with me, it's never going to happen to me."""
81	Or, we decide that we're going to prevent dementia,
84.633	and it will never happen to us because we're going to do everything right and it won't come and get us.
89.449	I'm looking for a third way: I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease.
95.2	Prevention is good, and I'm doing the things that you can do to prevent Alzheimer's.
100.76	I'm eating right, I'm exercising every day, I'm keeping my mind active,
106.08	that's what the research says you should do.
108.984	But the research also shows that there's nothing that will 100 percent protect you.
113.472	If the monster wants you, the monster's gonna get you.
116.984	That's what happened with my dad.
119.424	My dad was a bilingual college professor. His hobbies were chess, bridge and writing op-eds.
125.272	(Laughter)
129.278	He got dementia anyway.
131.396	If the monster wants you, the monster's gonna get you.
133.833	Especially if you're me, 'cause Alzheimer's tends to run in families.
139.593	So I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease.
143.342	Based on what I've learned from taking care of my father,
145.296	and researching what it's like to live with dementia, I'm focusing on three things in my preparation:
150.544	I'm changing what I do for fun, I'm working to build my physical strength,
156.536	and -- this is the hard one -- I'm trying to become a better person.
163.335	Let's start with the hobbies. When you get dementia, it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself.
169.024	You can't sit and have long talks with your old friends, because you don't know who they are.
173.16	It's confusing to watch television, and often very frightening.
177.448	And reading is just about impossible.
180.072	When you care for someone with dementia, and you get training,
183.528	they train you to engage them in activities that are familiar, hands-on, open-ended.
189.032	With my dad, that turned out to be letting him fill out forms.
193.544	He was a college professor at a state school; he knows what paperwork looks like.
199.049	He'll sign his name on every line, he'll check all the boxes,
203.704	he'll put numbers in where he thinks there should be numbers.
206.079	But it got me thinking, what would my caregivers do with me?
210.072	I'm my father's daughter. I read, I write, I think about global health a lot.
215.568	Would they give me academic journals so I could scribble in the margins?
219.824	Would they give me charts and graphs that I could color?
222.928	So I've been trying to learn to do things that are hands-on.
227.128	I've always liked to draw, so I'm doing it more even though I'm really very bad at it.
232.434	I am learning some basic origami. I can make a really great box.
238.056	(Laughter)
240.203	And I'm teaching myself to knit, which so far I can knit a blob.
247.285	But, you know, it doesn't matter if I'm actually good at it. What matters is that my hands know how to do it.
251.928	Because the more things that are familiar, the more things my hands know how to do,
255.417	the more things that I can be happy and busy doing when my brain's not running the show anymore.
260.41	They say that people who are engaged in activities are happier,
265.02	easier for their caregivers to look after, and it may even slow the progress of the disease.
269.912	That all seems like win to me.
272.424	I want to be as happy as I can for as long as I can.
275.447	A lot of people don't know that Alzheimer's actually has physical symptoms,
279.968	as well as cognitive symptoms. You lose your sense of balance,
284.242	you get muscle tremors, and that tends to lead people to being less and less mobile.
289.799	They get scared to walk around. They get scared to move.
292.384	So I'm doing activities that will build my sense of balance.
295.824	I'm doing yoga and tai chi to improve my balance, so that when I start to lose it,
300.485	I'll still be able to be mobile.
302.467	I'm doing weight-bearing exercise, so that I have the muscle strength
306.409	so that when I start to wither, I have more time that I can still move around.
310.538	Finally, the third thing. I'm trying to become a better person.
316.139	My dad was kind and loving before he had Alzheimer's, and he's kind and loving now.
320.906	I've seen him lose his intellect, his sense of humor, his language skills,
325.786	but I've also seen this: He loves me, he loves my sons,
330.266	he loves my brother and my mom and his caregivers.
333.977	And that love makes us want to be around him, even now.
338.682	even when it's so hard.
340.066	When you take away everything that he ever learned in this world,
343.369	his naked heart still shines.
345.658	I was never as kind as my dad, and I was never as loving.
349.577	And what I need now is to learn to be like that.
352.625	I need a heart so pure that if it's stripped bare by dementia, it will survive.
358.098	I don't want to get Alzheimer's disease.
360.617	What I want is a cure in the next 20 years, soon enough to protect me.
364.481	But if it comes for me, I'm going to be ready.
367.931	Thank you.
369.681	(Applause)
