15.26	If you had caught me straight out of college
17.26	in the halls of the Vermont State House
19.26	where I was a lobbyist in training
22.26	and asked me what I was going to do with my life,
24.26	I would have told you
26.26	that I'd just passed the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi,
28.26	the Chinese equivalency exam,
30.26	and I was going to go study law in Beijing,
33.26	and I was going to improve U.S.-China relations
37.26	through top-down policy changes
39.26	and judicial system reforms.
41.26	(Laughter)
44.26	(Applause)
46.26	I had a plan,
49.26	and I never ever thought
52.26	it would have anything to do
54.26	with the banjo.
58.26	Little did I know
60.26	what a huge impact it would have on me one night
62.26	when I was at a party
64.26	and I heard a sound coming out of a record player
66.26	in the corner of a room.
68.26	And it was Doc Watson
70.26	"singing and playing ""Shady Grove."""
73.26	♫ Shady Grove, my little love ♫
75.26	♫ Shady Grove, my darlin' ♫
77.26	♫ Shady Grove, my little love ♫
80.26	♫ Going back to Harlan ♫
84.26	That sound was just so beautiful,
87.26	the sound of Doc's voice
89.26	and the rippling groove of the banjo.
93.26	And after being totally and completely obsessed
97.26	with the mammoth richness and history
99.26	of Chinese culture,
101.26	it was like this total relief
105.26	to hear something so truly American
108.26	and so truly awesome.
111.26	I knew I had to take a banjo with me to China.
116.26	So before going to law school in China
118.26	I bought a banjo, I threw it in my little red truck
121.26	and I traveled down through Appalachia
124.26	and I learned a bunch of old American songs,
126.26	and I ended up in Kentucky
128.26	at the International Bluegrass Music Association Convention.
131.26	And I was sitting in a hallway one night
134.26	and a couple girls came up to me.
136.26	"And they said, ""Hey, do you want to jam?"""
138.26	"And I was like, ""Sure."""
140.26	So I picked up my banjo
142.26	and I nervously played four songs that I actually knew with them.
145.26	And a record executive walked up to me
147.26	and invited me to Nashville, Tennessee to make a record.
150.26	(Laughter)
157.26	It's been eight years,
161.26	and I can tell you that I didn't go to China to become a lawyer.
165.26	In fact, I went to Nashville.
167.26	And after a few months I was writing songs.
170.26	And the first song I wrote was in English,
172.26	and the second one was in Chinese.
176.26	(Music)
179.26	[Chinese]
189.26	Outside your door the world is waiting.
191.26	Inside your heart a voice is calling.
193.26	The four corners of the world are watching,
195.26	so travel daughter, travel.
198.26	Go get it, girl.
200.26	(Applause)
209.26	It's really been eight years since that fated night in Kentucky.
213.26	And I've played thousands of shows.
215.26	And I've collaborated
217.26	with so many incredible, inspirational musicians around the world.
221.26	And I see the power of music.
223.26	I see the power of music
225.26	to connect cultures.
227.26	I see it when I stand on a stage
229.26	in a bluegrass festival in east Virginia
231.26	and I look out at the sea of lawn chairs
233.26	and I bust out into a song in Chinese.
236.26	[Chinese]
239.26	And everybody's eyes just pop wide open
242.26	like it's going to fall out of their heads.
245.26	"And they're like, ""What's that girl doing?"""
247.26	And then they come up to me after the show
250.26	and they all have a story.
252.26	They all come up and they're like,
254.26	"""You know, my aunt's sister's babysitter's dog's chicken went to China"
258.26	"and adopted a girl."""
260.26	And I tell you what, it like everybody's got a story.
264.26	It's just incredible.
267.26	And then I go to China
269.26	and I stand on a stage at a university
272.26	and I bust out into a song in Chinese
274.26	and everybody sings along
277.26	and they roar with delight
279.26	at this girl
281.26	with the hair and the instrument,
283.26	and she's singing their music.
287.26	And I see, even more importantly,
291.26	the power of music to connect hearts.
294.26	Like the time I was in Sichuan Province
297.26	and I was singing for kids in relocation schools
300.26	in the earthquake disaster zone.
302.26	And this little girl comes up to me.
305.26	[Chinese]
311.26	"""Big sister Wong,"""
313.26	Washburn, Wong, same difference.
317.26	"""Big sister Wong, can I sing you a song"
320.26	that my mom sang for me
322.26	"before she was swallowed in the earthquake?"""
326.26	And I sat down,
328.26	she sat on my lap.
330.26	She started singing her song.
333.26	And the warmth of her body
336.26	and the tears rolling down her rosy cheeks,
340.26	and I started to cry.
343.26	And the light that shone off of her eyes
347.26	was a place I could have stayed forever.
351.26	And in that moment, we weren't our American selves,
354.26	we weren't our Chinese selves,
356.26	we were just mortals
360.26	sitting together in that light that keeps us here.
365.26	I want to dwell in that light
369.26	with you and with everyone.
371.26	And I know U.S.-China relations
373.26	doesn't need another lawyer.
375.26	Thank you.
377.26	(Applause)
