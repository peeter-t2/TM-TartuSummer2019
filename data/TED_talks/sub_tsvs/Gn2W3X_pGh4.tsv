15.702	Twelve years ago, I was in the street writing my name
19.602	"to say, ""I exist."""
21.441	Then I went to taking photos of people to paste them on the street
26.434	"to say, ""They exist."""
28.791	From the suburbs of Paris to the wall of Israel and Palestine,
33.306	the rooftops of Kenya
35.716	to the favelas of Rio,
37.604	paper and glue -- as easy as that.
41.347	I asked a question last year:
43.566	Can art change the world?
45.841	Well let me tell you,
47.843	in terms of changing the world there has been a lot of competition this year,
51.583	because the Arab Spring is still spreading,
54.777	the Eurozone has collapsed ... what else?
58.087	The Occupy movement found a voice,
61.08	and I still have to speak English constantly.
63.552	So there has been a lot of change.
66.385	So when I had my TED wish last year,
68.52	I said, look, I'm going to switch my concept.
71.683	You are going to take the photos.
74.351	You're going to send them to me.
76.931	I'm going to print them and send them back to you.
80.148	Then you're going to paste them where it makes sense
82.645	for you to place your own statement.
84.52	This is Inside Out.
86.989	One hundred thousand posters have been printed this year.
91.172	Those are the kind of posters, let me show you.
95.172	And we keep sending more every day.
97.427	This is the size.
98.871	Just a regular piece of paper with a little bit of ink on it.
102.793	This one was from Haiti.
106.308	When I launched my wish last year,
108.76	hundreds of people stood up and said they wanted to help us.
113.185	But I say it has to be
115.402	under the conditions I've always worked:
118.856	no credit, no logos, no sponsoring.
123.118	A week later, a handful of people were there ready to rock
127.468	and empower the people on the ground
129.922	who wanted to change the world.
131.468	These are the people I want to talk about to you today.
136.28	Two weeks after my speech, in Tunisia,
142.054	hundreds of portraits were made.
145.805	And they pasted [over] every single portrait of the dictator
150.052	[with] their own photos.
151.552	Boom! This is what happened.
154.385	Slim and his friends went through the country
156.135	and pasted hundreds of photos everywhere
158.51	to show the diversity in the country.
161.673	They really make Inside Out their own project.
165.756	Actually, that photo was pasted in a police station,
169.302	and what you see on the ground
170.806	are ID cards of all the photos of people being tracked by the police.
176.967	Russia. Chad wanted to fight against homophobia in Russia.
181.677	He went with his friends in front of every Russian embassy in Europe
186.2	and stood there with the photos
188.26	"to say, ""We have rights."""
190.02	They used Inside Out as a platform for protest.
194.551	Karachi, Pakistan.
196.468	Sharmeen is actually here.
198.268	She organized a TEDx action out there
201.633	and made all the unseen faces of the city
204.664	on the walls in her town.
206.927	And I want to thank her today.
209.258	North Dakota. Standing Rock Nation,
213.033	in this Turtle Island, [unclear name] from the Dakota Lakota tribe
218.768	wanted to show that the Native Americans are still here.
222.125	The seventh generation are still fighting for their rights.
225.76	He pasted up portraits all over his reservation.
228.735	And he's here also today.
230.602	Each time I get a wall in New York,
234.102	I use his photos to continue spreading the project.
239.123	Juarez: You've heard of the border --
242.177	one of the most dangerous borders in the world.
245.01	Monica has taken thousands of portraits with a group of photographers
249.783	and covered the entire border.
252.568	Do you know what it takes to do this?
254.593	People, energy, make the glue, organize the team.
258.695	It was amazing.
260.814	While in Iran at the same time
263.614	Abololo -- of course a nickname --
265.977	has pasted one single face of a woman
268.922	to show his resistance against the government.
272.521	I don't have to explain to you what kind of risk he took for that action.
277.231	There are tons of school projects.
279.833	Twenty percent of the posters we are receiving comes from schools.
283.483	Education is so essential.
285.383	Kids just make photos in a class, the teacher receives them,
288.718	they paste them on the school.
290.393	Here they even got the help of the firemen.
292.385	There should be even more schools doing this kind of project.
296.16	Of course we wanted to go back to Israel and Palestine.
301.995	So we went there with a truck. This is a photobooth truck.
305.03	You go on the back of that truck, it takes your photo,
311.364	Thousands of people use them
314.326	and each of them signs up for a two-state peace solution
318.497	and then walk in the street.
320.427	This is march, the 450,000 march -- beginning of September.
324.504	They were all holding their photo as a statement.
326.814	On the other side, people were wrapping up streets, buildings.
330.843	It's everywhere.
332.345	Come on, don't tell me that people aren't ready for peace out there.
335.364	These projects took thousands of actions in one year,
340.052	making hundreds of thousands of people participating,
343.218	creating millions of views.
346.893	This is the biggest global art participatory project that's going on.
353.998	"So back to the question, ""Can art change the world?"""
357.86	Maybe not in one year. That's the beginning.
361.716	But maybe we should change the question.
364.446	Can art change people's lives?
366.985	From what I've seen this year, yes.
370.86	And you know what? It's just the beginning.
373.543	Let's turn the world inside out together.
376.331	Thank you.
377.724	(Applause)
