13.047	I know what you're thinking:
15.063	"""Why does that guy get to sit down?"""
17.94	That's because this is radio.
21.097	(Music)
24.521	I tell radio stories about design,
27.494	and I report on all kinds of stories:
29.293	buildings and toothbrushes,
29.293	mascots and wayfinding and fonts.
33.864	My mission is to get people to engage
33.864	with the design that they care about
37.873	so they begin to pay attention
37.873	to all forms of design.
41.289	When you decode the world
41.289	with design intent in mind,
45.619	the world becomes kind of magical.
48.044	Instead of seeing the broken things,
50.365	you see all the little bits of genius
52.666	that anonymous designers have sweated over
52.666	to make our lives better.
57.17	And that's essentially
57.17	the definition of design:
59.505	making life better and providing joy.
63.245	And few things give me greater joy
65.54	than a well-designed flag.
68.596	(Laughter)
69.77	Yeah!
71.057	(Applause)
73.279	Happy 50th anniversary
73.279	on your flag, Canada.
75.781	It is beautiful, gold standard.
78.415	Love it.
79.772	I'm kind of obsessed with flags.
82.386	Sometimes I bring up the topic of flags,
84.33	and people are like,
84.33	"""I don't care about flags,"""
87.948	and then we start talking
87.948	about flags, and trust me,
93.846	There's just something about them
93.846	that works on our emotions.
97.361	My family wrapped my Christmas presents
97.361	as flags this year,
101.412	including the blue gift bag
101.412	that's dressed up as the flag of Scotland.
108.192	I put this picture online,
108.192	and sure enough,
110.501	within the first few minutes,
110.501	someone left a comment that said,
113.49	"""You can take that Scottish Saltire"
113.49	"and shove it up your ass."""
116.969	(Laughter)
118.721	See, people are passionate
118.721	about flags, you know?
121.043	That's the way it is.
122.361	What I love about flags
123.924	is that once you understand
123.924	the design of flags,
126.219	what makes a good flag,
126.219	what makes a bad flag,
128.813	you can understand
128.813	the design of almost anything.
131.396	So what I'm going to do here is,
133.207	I cracked open an episode
133.207	of my radio show,
136.767	"""99% Invisible,"" and I'm going"
136.767	to reconstruct it here on stage,
139.861	so when I press a button over here --
142.151	Voice: S for Sound --
144.05	Roman Mars: It's going to make a sound,
145.975	and so whenever you hear a sound
145.975	or a voice or a piece of music,
149.064	it's because I pressed a button.
150.775	Voice: Sound.
152.879	RM: All right, got it? Here we go.
156.719	Three, two.
159.825	This is 99% Invisible. I'm Roman Mars.
166.944	(Music)
168.969	Narrator: The five basic
168.969	principles of flag design.
171.599	Roman Mars: According to the North
171.599	American Vexillological Association.
175.129	Vexillological.
176.959	Ted Kaye: Vexillology
176.959	is the study of flags.
180.029	"RM: It's that extra ""lol"""
180.029	that makes it sound weird.
182.485	Narrator: Number one, keep it simple.
184.403	The flag should be so simple
184.403	that a child can draw it from memory.
187.712	RM: Before I moved to Chicago in 2005,
189.687	I didn't even know cities
189.687	had their own flags.
192.211	TK: Most larger cities do have flags.
194.112	RM: Well, I didn't know that,
194.112	that's Ted Kaye, by the way.
196.865	TK: Hello.
198.064	RM: He's a flag expert,
198.064	he's a totally awesome guy.
200.498	TK: I'm Ted Kaye, I have edited
200.498	a scholarly journal on flag studies,
203.737	and I am currently involved
203.737	with the Portland Flag Association
206.735	and the North American
206.735	Vexillological Association.
210.122	RM: Ted literally wrote
210.122	the book on flag design.
213.123	"Narrator: ""Good Flag, Bad Flag."""
214.675	RM: It's more of a pamphlet, really,
214.675	it's about 16 pages.
217.395	"TK: Yes, it's called ""Good Flag, Bad Flag:"
217.395	"How to Design a Great Flag."""
221.328	RM: And that first city flag
221.328	I discovered in Chicago
224.047	is a beaut:
225.318	white field, two horizontal blue stripes,
228.867	and four six-pointed red stars
228.867	down the middle.
231.752	(Sound)
233.314	Narrator: Number two,
233.314	use meaningful symbolism.
235.599	TK: The blue stripes represent
235.599	the water, the river and the lake.
238.675	Narrator: The flag's images,
238.675	colors or pattern
240.903	should relate to what it symbolizes.
242.65	TK: The red stars represent
242.65	significant events in Chicago's history.
246.459	RM: Namely, the founding of Fort Dearborn
246.459	on the future site of Chicago,
250.187	the Great Chicago Fire,
253.046	the World Columbian Exposition,
253.046	which everyone remembers
255.717	because of the White City,
257.535	and the Century of Progress Exposition,
257.535	which no one remembers at all.
262.433	Narrator: Number three,
262.433	use two to three basic colors.
264.986	TK: The basic rule for colors
264.986	is to use two to three colors
268.478	from the standard color set:
268.478	red, white, blue, green, yellow and black.
273.926	RM: The design of the Chicago flag
273.926	has complete buy-in
276.492	with an entire cross-section of the city.
278.483	It is everywhere;
279.675	every municipal building flies the flag.
282.263	Whet Moser: There's probably
282.263	at least one store on every block
285.22	near where I work that sells
285.22	some sort of Chicago flag paraphernalia.
288.487	RM: That's Whet Moser
288.487	from Chicago magazine.
290.918	WM: Today, just for example,
290.918	I went to get a haircut,
293.935	and when I sat down in the barber's chair,
296.333	there was a Chicago flag on the box
296.333	that the barber kept all his tools in,
300.804	and then in the mirror, there was
300.804	a Chicago flag on the wall behind me.
304.287	When I left, a guy passed me who had
304.287	a Chicago flag badge on his backpack.
309.279	RM: It's adaptable and remixable.
311.366	The six-pointed stars in particular
311.366	show up in all kinds of places.
314.955	WM: The coffee I bought the other day
314.955	had a Chicago star on it.
318.66	RM: It's a distinct symbol
318.66	of Chicago pride.
321.655	TK: When a police officer
321.655	or a firefighter dies in Chicago,
325.376	often it's not the flag
325.376	of the United States on his casket.
328.99	It can be the flag of the city of Chicago.
331.912	That's how deeply the flag has gotten
331.912	into the civic imagery of Chicago.
337.566	RM: And it isn't just that people
337.566	love Chicago and therefore love the flag.
341.275	I also think that people love Chicago more
341.275	because the flag is so cool.
347.154	TK: A positive feedback loop there
347.154	between great symbolism and civic pride.
352.278	RM: OK, so when I moved back
352.278	to San Francisco in 2008,
355.532	I researched its flag,
356.925	because I had never seen it
356.925	in the previous eight years I lived there.
362.027	And I found it, I am sorry to say,
364.935	sadly lacking.
367.211	(Laughter)
370.345	I know.
372.528	It hurts me, too.
373.796	(Laughter)
376.643	TK: Well, let me start from the top.
378.41	Narrator: Number one, keep it simple.
380.22	TK: Keeping it simple.
381.42	Narrator: The flag should be so simple
381.42	that a child can draw it from memory.
385.018	TK: It's a relatively complex flag.
386.911	RM: OK, here we go, OK.
388.203	The main component
388.203	of the San Francisco flag is a phoenix
390.912	representing the city
390.912	rising from the ashes
393.145	after the devastating fires of the 1850s.
396.211	TK: A powerful symbol for San Francisco.
398.995	RM: I still don't really dig the phoenix.
400.994	Design-wise, it manages
400.994	to both be too crude
403.664	and have too many details
403.664	at the same time,
406.5	which if you were trying for that,
408.215	you wouldn't be able to do it,
410.156	and it just looks bad at a distance,
411.93	but having deep meaning
411.93	puts that element in the plus column.
415.622	Behind the phoenix,
415.622	the background is mostly white,
418.846	and then it has a substantial
418.846	gold border around it.
422.175	TK: Which is a very attractive
422.175	design element.
425.295	RM: I think it's OK, but --
426.617	(Laughter)
428.2	here come the big no-nos of flag design.
431.22	Narrator: Number four,
431.22	no lettering or seals.
433.641	Never use writing of any kind.
435.901	RM: Underneath the phoenix,
435.901	there's a motto on a ribbon
438.523	that translates to
438.523	"""Gold in peace, iron in war,"""
441.502	plus -- and this is the big problem --
443.857	it says San Francisco across the bottom.
447.09	TK: If you need to write the name
447.09	of what you're representing on your flag,
450.949	your symbolism has failed.
452.749	(Laughter)
454.549	(Applause)
456.577	RM: The United States flag
456.577	"doesn't say ""USA"" across the front."
460.542	In fact, country flags,
460.542	they tend to behave.
463.723	Like, hats off to South Africa
463.723	and Turkey and Israel
467.034	and Somalia and Japan and Gambia.
469.186	There's a bunch
469.186	of really great country flags,
471.728	but they obey good design principles
471.728	because the stakes are high.
475.983	They're on the international stage.
478.404	But city, state and regional flags
478.404	are another story.
483.058	(Laughter)
484.975	There is a scourge of bad flags --
487.731	(Laughter)
488.8	and they must be stopped.
490.332	(Laughter)
491.515	(Applause)
492.761	That is the truth and that is the dare.
496.385	The first step is to recognize
496.385	that we have a problem.
500.268	(Laughter)
504.586	A lot of people tend to think
504.586	that good design
507.333	is just a matter of taste,
508.694	and quite honestly,
508.694	sometimes it is, actually,
511.74	but sometimes it isn't, all right?
514.145	(Laughter)
515.747	Here's the full list of NAVA
515.747	flag design principles.
520.328	Narrator: The five
520.328	basic principles of flag design.
523.006	Narrator: Number one.
523.006	TK: Keep it simple.
525.626	Narrator: Number two.
525.626	TK: Use meaningful symbolism.
528.078	Narrator: Number three.
528.078	TK: Use two to three basic colors.
530.849	Narrator: Number four.
530.849	TK: No lettering or seals.
533.169	Narrator: Never use writing of any kind.
535.125	TK: Because you can't
535.125	read that at a distance.
537.341	Narrator: Number five.
537.341	TK: And be distinctive.
539.528	RM: All the best flags tend
539.528	to stick to these principles.
542.226	And like I said before,
542.226	most country flags are OK.
544.6	But here's the thing:
545.786	if you showed this list of principles
545.786	to any designer of almost anything,
549.302	they would say these principles --
549.302	simplicity, deep meaning,
552.153	having few colors
552.153	or being thoughtful about colors,
554.907	uniqueness, don't have
554.907	writing you can't read --
557.183	all those principles apply to them, too.
559.781	But sadly, good design principles
559.781	are rarely invoked in US city flags.
564.876	Our biggest problem
564.876	seems to be that fourth one.
567.387	We just can't stop ourselves
567.387	from putting our names on our flags,
571.52	or little municipal seals
571.52	with tiny writing on them.
575.415	Here's the thing about municipal seals:
577.343	They were designed
577.343	to be on pieces of paper
580.128	where you can read them,
581.356	not on flags 100 feet away
581.356	flapping in the breeze.
584.533	So here's a bunch of flags again.
586.428	Vexillologists call these SOBs:
589.64	Seals on a bedsheet --
591.082	(Laughter)
592.278	and if you can't tell
592.278	what city they go to,
595.18	yeah, that's exactly the problem,
597.071	except for Anaheim,
597.071	apparently, they fixed it.
600.043	(Laughter)
603.208	These flags are everywhere in the US.
605.565	The European equivalent
605.565	of the municipal seal
607.758	is the city coat of arms ...
610.368	and this is where we can learn
610.368	a lesson for how to do things right.
613.573	So this is the city
613.573	coat of arms of Amsterdam.
615.774	Now, if this were a United States city,
617.814	the flag would probably look like this.
620.062	You know, yeah.
621.264	(Laughter)
622.521	But instead, the flag of Amsterdam
624.595	looks like this.
627.546	Rather than plopping
627.546	the whole coat of arms
629.989	on a solid background and writing
629.989	"""Amsterdam"" below it,"
633.184	they just take the key elements
633.184	of the escutcheon, the shield,
636.117	and they turn it into the most
636.117	badass city flag in the world.
639.688	(Laughter)
641.442	(Applause)
645.794	And because it's so badass,
648.03	those flags and crosses
648.03	are found throughout Amsterdam,
650.763	just like Chicago, they're used.
653.955	Even though seal-on-a-bedsheet flags
653.955	are particularly painful
656.892	and offensive to me,
658.161	nothing can quite prepare you
660.764	for one of the biggest train wrecks
660.764	in vexillological history.
663.869	(Laughter)
665.137	Are you ready?
666.815	It's the flag of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
669.594	(Laughter)
677.465	I mean, it's distinctive,
681.459	I'll give them that.
684.114	Steve Kodis: It was adopted in 1955.
686.791	RM: The city ran a contest
688.094	and gathered a bunch of submissions
688.094	with all kinds of designs.
691.513	SK: And an alderman
691.513	by the name of Fred Steffan
695.744	cobbled together parts of the submissions
695.744	to make what is now the Milwaukee flag.
702.98	RM: It's a kitchen sink flag.
705.069	There's a gigantic gear
705.069	representing industry,
707.905	there's a ship recognizing the port,
710.18	a giant stalk of wheat
711.713	paying homage to the brewing industry.
713.803	It's a hot mess,
715.517	and Steve Kodis, a graphic designer
715.517	from Milwaukee, wants to change it.
720.368	SK: It's really awful.
721.964	It's a misstep on the city's behalf,
725.411	to say the least.
727.617	RM: But what puts
727.617	the Milwaukee flag over the top,
730.059	almost to the point of self-parody,
732.163	is on it is a picture of the Civil War
732.163	battle flag of the Milwaukee regiment.
738.109	SK: So that's the final element in it
740.439	that just makes it
740.439	that much more ridiculous,
742.85	that there is a flag design
742.85	within the Milwaukee flag.
747.549	RM: On the flag. Yeah. Yeah.
749.642	(Laughter)
750.831	Yeah.
752.161	(Music)
753.893	Now, Milwaukee is a fantastic city.
756.308	I've been there, I love it.
758.583	The most depressing part
758.583	of this flag, though,
760.883	is that there have been
760.883	two major redesign contests.
764.004	The last one was held in 2001.
768.773	TK: But in the end, the members
768.773	of the Milwaukee Arts Board
771.565	decided that none of the new entries
771.565	were worthy of flying over the city.
775.118	RM: They couldn't agree
775.118	to change that thing!
777.522	(Laughter)
778.775	That's discouraging enough
778.775	to make you think
780.861	that good design and democracy
780.861	just simply do not go together.
784.284	(Laughter)
785.462	But Steve Kotas is going
785.462	to try one more time
788.315	to redesign the Milwaukee flag.
791.188	SK: I believe Milwaukee is a great city.
793.173	Every great city deserves a great flag.
796.325	RM: Steve isn't ready
796.325	to reveal his design yet.
798.575	One of the things about
798.575	proposing one of these things
801.121	is you have to get people on board,
802.817	and then you reveal your design.
804.407	But here's the trick:
805.721	If you want to design a great flag,
807.433	a kick-ass flag like Chicago's or DC's,
807.433	which also has a great flag,
811.298	start by drawing
811.298	a one-by-one-and-a-half-inch rectangle
814.16	on a piece of paper.
815.528	Your design has to fit
815.528	within that tiny rectangle.
818.05	Here's why.
819.288	TK: A three-by-five-foot flag
819.288	on a pole 100 feet away
824.35	looks about the same size
824.35	as a one-by-one-and-a-half-inch rectangle
830.995	seen about 15 inches from your eye.
833.598	You'd be surprised by how compelling
833.598	and simple the design can be
837.759	when you hold yourself to that limitation.
841.102	RM: Meanwhile, back in San Francisco.
843.886	Is there anything we can do?
846.697	TK: I like to say that in every bad flag
846.697	there's a good flag trying to get out.
850.671	The way to make
850.671	San Francisco's flag a good flag
853.143	is to take the motto off
853.143	because you can't read that at a distance.
856.698	Take the name off,
858.226	and the border might even be made thicker,
858.226	so it's more a part of the flag.
862.483	And I would simply take the phoenix
864.36	and make it a great big element
864.36	in the middle of the flag.
867.761	RM: But the current phoenix,
867.761	that's got to go.
870.606	TK: I would simplify
870.606	or stylize the phoenix.
874.036	Depict a big, wide-winged bird
876.295	coming out of flames.
877.952	Emphasize those flames.
879.779	RM: So this San Francisco flag
879.779	was designed by Frank Chimero
882.646	based on Ted Kaye's suggestions.
884.208	I don't know what he would do
884.208	if we was completely unfettered
887.091	and didn't follow those guidelines.
888.799	Fans of my radio show and podcast,
888.799	heard me complain about bad flags.
892.089	They've sent me other suggested designs.
894.036	This one's by Neil Mussett.
895.819	Both are so much better.
898.887	(Laughter)
900.339	And I think if they were adopted,
902.292	I would see them around the city.
905.135	In my crusade to make
905.135	flags of the world more beautiful,
908.353	many listeners have taken it
908.353	upon themselves
910.473	to redesign their flags
910.473	and look into the feasibility
912.983	of getting them officially adopted.
915.039	(Music)
916.316	If you see your city flag and like it,
918.971	fly it,
920.213	even if it violates a design rule or two.
922.287	I don't care.
923.682	But if you don't see your city flag,
925.866	maybe it doesn't exist, but maybe it does,
929.06	and it just sucks,
930.4	and I dare you to join the effort
930.4	to try to change that.
935.867	As we move more and more into cities,
938.483	the city flag will become
938.483	not just a symbol of that city as a place,
943.402	but also, it could become a symbol
943.402	of how that city considers design itself,
949.709	especially today, as the populace
949.709	is becoming more design-aware.
952.958	And I think design awareness
952.958	is at an all-time high.
955.99	A well-designed flag could be seen
955.99	as an indicator of how a city
960.045	considers all of its design systems:
962.674	its public transit,
964.306	its parks, its signage.
966.303	It might seem frivolous, but it's not.
969.857	TK: Often when city leaders say,
971.717	"""We have more important things to do"
971.717	"than worry about a city flag,"""
976.217	my response is,
977.84	"""If you had a great city flag,"
979.444	you would have a banner
979.444	for people to rally under
982.184	"to face those more important things."""
985.781	(Music)
986.955	RM: I've seen firsthand
986.955	what a good city flag can do
989.411	in the case of Chicago.
990.724	The marriage of good design
990.724	and civic pride
993.335	is something that we need in all places.
995.851	The best part about municipal flags
995.851	is that we own them.
999.727	They are an open-source,
1001.302	publicly owned design language
1001.302	of the community.
1004.991	When they are done well,
1006.408	they are remixable, adaptable,
1006.408	and they are powerful.
1010.677	We could control the branding
1010.677	and graphical imagery
1013.116	of our cities with a good flag,
1014.74	but instead, by having
1014.74	bad flags we don't use,
1017.439	we cede that territory to sports teams
1020.409	and chambers of commerce
1020.409	and tourism boards.
1022.836	Sports teams can leave
1022.836	and break our hearts.
1025.357	And besides, some of us
1025.357	don't really care about sports.
1028.465	And tourism campaigns can just be cheesy.
1031.725	But a great city flag
1033.272	is something that represents
1033.272	a city to its people
1035.686	and its people to the world at large.
1037.869	And when that flag is a beautiful thing,
1040.328	that connection is a beautiful thing.
1043.219	So maybe all the city flags
1043.219	can be as inspiring as Hong Kong
1046.721	or Portland or Trondheim,
1048.897	and we can do away with all the bad flags
1050.904	like San Francisco, Milwaukee,
1050.904	Cedar Rapids,
1054.827	and finally, when we're all done,
1057.49	we can do something
1057.49	about Pocatello, Idaho,
1060.329	considered by the North American
1060.329	Vexillological Association
1064.05	as the worst city flag in North America.
1068.179	[Proud to be Pocatello]
1069.37	(Laughter)
1071.95	(Applause)
1075.896	Yeah.
1077.071	(Applause)
1078.372	That thing has a trademark
1078.372	symbol on it, people.
1080.901	(Laughter)
1082.94	That hurts me just to look at.
1084.652	(Laughter)
1085.915	Thank you so much for listening.
1087.86	(Applause)
