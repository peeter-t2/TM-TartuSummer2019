26.388	I bet you're worried.
28	(Laughter)
30	I was worried.
32.157	That's why I began this piece.
33.853	I was worried about vaginas.
37.765	I was worried what we think about vaginas
40	and even more worried
40	that we don't think about them.
43.654	I was worried about my own vagina.
45.853	It needed a context, a culture,
45.853	a community of other vaginas.
51.015	There is so much darkness
51.015	and secrecy surrounding them.
54.744	Like the Bermuda Triangle,
54.744	nobody ever reports back from there.
59.416	(Laughter)
60.542	In the first place, it's not so easy
60.542	to even find your vagina.
64.66	Women go days, weeks, months,
64.66	without looking at it.
68.136	I interviewed a high-powered
68.136	businesswoman;
70.485	she told me she didn't have time.
73.001	"""Looking at your vagina,"""
73.001	"she said, ""is a full day's work."""
75.879	(Laughter)
77	"""You've got to get down there"
77	on your back, in front of a mirror,
80.12	full-length preferred.
81.443	You've got to get in the perfect position
81.443	with the perfect light,
84.569	which then becomes shadowed
84.569	by the angle you're at.
87	You're twisting your head up,
87	"arching your back, it's exhausting."""
90.235	She was busy; she didn't have time.
92.878	So I decided to talk to women
92.878	about their vaginas.
96.068	They began as casual vagina interviews,
99.06	and they turned into vagina monologues.
101.764	I talked with over 200 women.
104.008	I talked to older women, younger women,
106.433	married women, lesbians, single women.
109.163	I talked to corporate professionals,
109.163	college professors, actors, sex workers.
114	I talked to African-American women,
114	Asian-American women,
117.531	Native-American women,
117.531	Caucasian women, Jewish women.
121.762	OK, at first women were a little shy,
121.762	a little reluctant to talk.
127.052	Once they got going,
127.052	you couldn't stop them.
130.192	Women love to talk
130.192	about their vaginas, they do.
134.121	Mainly because no one's ever
134.121	asked them before.
136.584	(Laughter)
137.678	Let's just start with the word
137.678	"""vagina"" -- vagina, vagina."
143	It sounds like an infection, at best.
145.88	Maybe a medical instrument.
147.6	"""Hurry, nurse, bring the vagina!"""
149.384	(Laughter)
150.469	Vagina, vagina, vagina.
152.064	It doesn't matter how many times
152.064	you say the word,
154.627	it never sounds like a word
154.627	you want to say.
157.307	It's a completely ridiculous,
157.307	totally un-sexy word.
162	If you use it during sex,
162	trying to be politically correct,
165.095	"""Darling, would you stroke my vagina,"""
168.33	you kill the act right there.
170.447	(Laughter)
172.141	I'm worried what we call them
172.141	and don't call them.
175.817	In Great Neck, New York,
175.817	they call it a Pussycat.
178.575	A woman told me there
178.575	her mother used to tell her,
181	"""Don't wear panties, dear,"
181	underneath your pajamas.
183.432	"You need to air out your Pussycat."""
185.242	(Laughter)
189	In Westchester, they call it a Pooki,
191.714	in New Jersey, a twat.
193.878	There's Powderbox, derriere,
193.878	a Pooky, a Poochi, a Poopi,
198.212	a Poopelu, a Pooninana,
198.212	a Padepachetchki, a Pal, and a Piche.
202.711	(Laughter)
204.187	There's Toadie, Dee Dee, Nishi,
204.187	Dignity, Coochi Snorcher,
209.611	Cooter, Labbe, Gladys Seagelman, VA,
214.481	Wee wee, Horsespot, Nappy Dugout,
219	Mongo, Ghoulie, Powderbox,
219	a Mimi in Miami,
225.23	a Split Knish in Philadelphia ...
227.361	(Laughter)
228.472	and a Schmende in the Bronx.
230.382	(Laughter)
231.598	I am worried about vaginas.
234.638	"This is how the ""Vagina"
234.638	"Monologues"" begins."
237.444	But it really didn't begin there.
240.074	It began with a conversation with a woman.
243.723	We were having a conversation
243.723	about menopause,
246.236	and we got onto the subject of her vagina,
248.291	which you'll do if you're
248.291	talking about menopause.
250.664	And she said things that really
250.664	shocked me about her vagina --
253.626	that it was dried-up
253.626	and finished and dead --
255.769	and I was kind of shocked.
257.046	So I said to a friend casually,
258.744	"""Well, what do you think"
258.744	"about your vagina?"""
260.822	And that woman said
260.822	something more amazing,
262.864	and then the next woman said
262.864	something more amazing,
265.322	and before I knew it,
265.322	every woman was telling me
267.59	I had to talk to somebody
267.59	about their vagina
269.691	because they had an amazing story,
271.342	and I was sucked down the vagina trail.
273.249	(Laughter)
274.583	And I really haven't gotten off of it.
277.04	I think if you had told me
277.04	when I was younger
279.172	that I was going to grow up,
279.172	and be in shoe stores,
281.584	and people would scream out,
281.584	"""There she is, the Vagina Lady!"""
284.474	I don't know that that would have
284.474	been my life ambition.
287.135	(Laughter)
288.162	But I want to talk a little bit
288.162	about happiness,
290.433	and the relationship
290.433	to this whole vagina journey,
292.81	because it has been
292.81	an extraordinary journey
294.914	that began eight years ago.
296.63	I think before I did
296.63	"the ""Vagina Monologues,"""
298.92	I didn't really believe in happiness.
301.748	I thought that only idiots
301.748	were happy, to be honest.
304.798	I remember when I started
304.798	practicing Buddhism 14 years ago,
308.616	and I was told that the end
308.616	of this practice was to be happy,
311.843	"I said, ""How could you be happy"
311.843	and live in this world of suffering
315.215	"and live in this world of pain?"""
317.051	I mistook happiness
317.051	for a lot of other things,
321	like numbness or decadence or selfishness.
324.723	And what happened through the course
324.723	"of the ""Vagina Monologues"""
327.714	and this journey is,
327.714	I think I have come to understand
330.275	a little bit more about happiness.
332.538	There are three qualities
332.538	I want to talk about.
335	One is seeing what's
335	right in front of you,
338.937	and talking about it, and stating it.
341.419	I think what I learned
341.419	from talking about the vagina
344	and speaking about the vagina,
344	is it was the most obvious thing --
347.167	it was right in the center of my body
347.167	and the center of the world --
350.43	and yet it was the one thing
350.43	nobody talked about.
353.23	The second thing is that what talking
353.23	about the vagina did
357.507	is it opened this door
357.507	which allowed me to see
360.442	that there was a way to serve
360.442	the world to make it better.
363.487	And that's where the deepest happiness
363.487	has actually come from.
367	And the third principle of happiness,
367	which I've realized recently:
370.731	Eight years ago, this momentum
370.731	"and this energy, this ""V-wave"" started --"
375	and I can only describe it
375	"as a ""V-wave"" because, to be honest,"
378.254	I really don't understand it completely;
378.254	I feel at the service of it.
382	But this wave started,
382	and if I question the wave,
385	or try to stop the wave
385	or look back at the wave,
388.462	I often have the experience of whiplash
391	or the potential of my neck breaking.
393.276	But if I go with the wave,
394.65	and I trust the wave
394.65	and I move with the wave,
397.068	I go to the next place, and it happens
397.068	logically and organically and truthfully.
401.599	And I started this piece, particularly
401.599	with stories and narratives,
407.325	and I was talking to one woman
407.325	and that led to another woman
410.183	and that led to another woman.
412.025	And then I wrote those stories down,
413.894	and I put them out
413.894	in front of other people.
416.12	And every single time
416.12	I did the show at the beginning,
418.716	women would literally
418.716	line up after the show,
421.418	because they wanted
421.418	to tell me their stories.
423.677	"And at first I thought, ""Oh great,"
423.677	I'll hear about wonderful orgasms,
427.011	and great sex lives, and how women
427.011	"love their vaginas."""
429.637	But in fact, that's not
429.637	what women lined up to tell me.
433.31	What women lined up to tell me
433.31	was how they were raped,
436.426	and how they were battered,
436.426	and how they were beaten,
438.928	and how they were gang-raped
438.928	in parking lots,
441.11	and how they were incested
441.11	by their uncles.
443.155	And I wanted to stop doing
443.155	"the ""Vagina Monologues,"""
445.877	because it felt too daunting.
447.306	I felt like a war photographer
447.306	who takes pictures of terrible events,
450.797	but doesn't intervene on their behalf.
453.18	And so in 1997, I said,
453.18	"""Let's get women together."
457.421	What could we do with this information
459.621	"that all these women are being violated?"""
462.537	And it turned out, after thinking
462.537	and investigating,
465.746	that I discovered -- and the UN
465.746	has actually said this recently --
469.167	that one out of every three
469.167	women on this planet
472	will be beaten or raped in her lifetime.
475.103	That's essentially a gender;
476.691	that's essentially the resource
476.691	of the planet, which is women.
480.11	So in 1997 we got all these incredible
480.11	women together and we said,
483.306	"""How can we use the play, this energy,"
483.306	"to stop violence against women?"""
487.771	And we put on one event
487.771	in New York City, in the theater,
490.47	and all these great actors
490.47	came -- from Susan Sarandon,
493.085	to Glenn Close, to Whoopi Goldberg --
494.919	and we did one performance on one evening,
497.783	and that catalyzed this wave, this energy.
502	And within five years,
504.075	this extraordinary thing began to happen.
506.564	One woman took that energy and she said,
506.564	"""I want to bring this wave,"
510	"this energy, to college campuses,"""
512.589	and so she took the play and she said,
514.631	"""Let's use the play and have"
514.631	performances once a year,
517.828	where we can raise money
517.828	to stop violence against women
520.441	in local communities
520.441	"all around the world."""
522.675	And in one year, it went to 50 colleges,
522.675	and then it expanded.
526.167	And over the course of the last six years,
528.471	it's spread and it's spread
528.471	and it's spread around the world.
532.39	What I have learned is two things:
536.005	one, that the epidemic of violence
536.005	towards women is shocking; it's global;
542	it is so profound
542	and it is so devastating,
544.072	and it is so in every little pocket
544.072	of every little crater,
547	of every little society
547	that we don't even recognize it,
549.691	because it's become ordinary.
551.854	This journey has taken me to Afghanistan,
554.779	where I had the extraordinary
554.779	honor and privilege
557.532	to go into parts of Afghanistan
557.532	under the Taliban.
561.881	I was dressed in a burqa and I went in
561.881	with an extraordinary group,
565.549	called the Revolutionary Association
565.549	of the Women of Afghanistan.
568.942	And I saw firsthand
568.942	how women had been stripped
572	of every single right that was possible
572	to strip women of --
576.189	from being educated, to being employed,
578.72	to being actually allowed
578.72	to eat ice cream.
581.723	For those of you who don't know,
583.288	it was illegal to eat ice cream
583.288	under the Taliban.
585.66	And I actually saw and met
585.66	women who had been flogged
589.46	for being caught eating vanilla ice cream.
591.795	I was taken to the secret ice cream-eating
591.795	place in a little town,
596.221	where we went to a back room,
596.221	and women were seated
599.088	and a curtain was pulled around us,
599.088	and they were served vanilla ice cream.
602.844	And women lifted their burqas
602.844	and ate this ice cream.
606.284	And I don't think I ever understood
606.284	pleasure until that moment,
609.428	and how women have found a way
609.428	to keep their pleasure alive.
613	It has taken me, this journey,
613	to Islamabad,
615.572	where I have witnessed and met women
615.572	with their faces melted off.
619.233	It has taken me to Juarez, Mexico,
619.233	where I was a week ago,
623.109	where I have literally been
623.109	there in parking lots,
625.754	where bones of women have washed up
627.627	and been dumped next to Coca-Cola bottles.
631.672	It has taken me to universities
631.672	all over this country,
634.699	where girls are date-raped and drugged.
637.215	I have seen terrible, terrible,
637.215	terrible violence.
641.376	But I have also recognized,
641.376	in the course of seeing that violence,
645.303	that being in the face of things
645.303	and seeing actually what's in front of us
649.945	is the antidote to depression,
652.805	and to a feeling that one
652.805	is worthless and has no value.
656	"Because before the ""Vagina Monologues,"""
658	I will say that 80 percent
658	of my consciousness was closed off
661	to what was really going on
661	in this reality,
663.858	and that closing-off closed off
663.858	my vitality and my life energy.
668.707	What has also happened
668.707	is in the course of these travels --
671.541	and it's been an extraordinary thing --
674.097	is that every single place
674.097	that I have gone to in the world,
677.011	I have met a new species.
678.447	And I really love hearing about all
678.447	these species at the bottom of the sea.
682.185	And I was thinking about how being
682.185	with these extraordinary people
685.568	on this particular panel,
687.226	that it's beneath, beyond and between,
690	and the vagina kind of fits
690	into all those categories.
693	(Laughter)
694.486	But one of the things
694.486	I've seen is this species --
697	and it is a species,
697	and it is a new paradigm,
699.999	and it doesn't get reported
699.999	in the press or in the media
702.657	because I don't think
702.657	good news ever is news,
705.719	and I don't think people
705.719	who are transforming the planet
708.386	are what gets the ratings on TV shows.
711.291	But every single country I have been to --
713.339	and in the last six years,
713.339	I've been to about 45 countries,
716.268	and many tiny little villages
716.268	and cities and towns --
719.346	I have seen something what I've come
719.346	"to call ""vagina warriors."""
723.118	"A ""vagina warrior"" is a woman,"
723.118	or a vagina-friendly man,
727.317	who has witnessed incredible
727.317	violence or suffered it,
730.935	and rather than getting an AK-47
730.935	or a weapon of mass destruction
735.33	or a machete,
737.794	they hold the violence in their bodies;
740.555	they grieve it; they experience it;
740.555	and then they go out
744.683	and devote their lives to making sure
744.683	it doesn't happen to anybody else.
748.94	I have met these women
748.94	everywhere on the planet,
751.684	and I want to tell a few stories,
753.47	because I believe that stories are the way
753.47	that we transmit information,
757	where it goes into our bodies.
759.217	And I think one of the things about being
759.217	at TED that's been very interesting
763.208	is that I live in my body a lot,
765.142	and I don't live in my head
765.142	very much anymore.
767.408	And this is a very heady place.
769.241	And it's been really interesting
769.241	to be in my head
771.711	for the last two days;
771.711	I've been very disoriented --
774.453	(Laughter)
775.478	because I think the world, the V-world,
775.478	is very much in your body.
779	It's a body world, and the species
779	really exists in the body.
782.852	And I think there's a real significance
782.852	in us attaching our bodies to our heads,
787.185	that that separation has created a divide
790.315	that is often separating
790.315	purpose from intent.
793.845	And the connection between body and head
797.015	often brings those things into union.
799.735	I want to talk about three
799.735	particular people that I've met,
802.806	vagina warriors, who really
802.806	transformed my understanding
806.379	of this whole principle and species,
808.363	and one is a woman named Marsha Lopez.
811.251	Marsha Lopez was a woman
811.251	I met in Guatemala.
814.336	She was 14 years old,
814.336	and she was in a marriage
817.388	and her husband was beating her
817.388	on a regular basis.
820.412	And she couldn't get out,
821.905	because she was addicted
821.905	to the relationship,
824.047	and she had no money.
825.349	Her sister was younger than her,
825.349	and she applied --
827.842	"we had a ""Stop Rape"" contest"
827.842	a few years ago in New York --
832	and she applied, hoping
832	that she would become a finalist
835	and she could bring her sister.
836.866	She did become a finalist;
836.866	she brought Marsha to New York.
841	And at that time,
842.269	we did this extraordinary V-Day
842.269	at Madison Square Garden,
844.984	where we sold out the entire
844.984	testosterone-filled dome --
	"to say ""Yes"" to vaginas,"
851.68	which was really a pretty
851.68	incredible transformation.
854.438	And she came, and she witnessed this,
856.281	and she decided that she would go back
856.281	and leave her husband,
859.391	and that she would bring
859.391	V-Day to Guatemala.
861.478	She was 21 years old.
863.075	I went to Guatemala and she had sold out
863.075	the National Theater of Guatemala.
868.293	And I watched her walk up on stage
868.293	in her red short dress and high heels,
872.751	and she stood there and said,
872.751	"""My name is Marsha."
876.256	I was beaten by my husband for five years.
876.256	He almost murdered me.
880.041	"I left and you can, too."""
882.556	And the entire 2,000 people
882.556	went absolutely crazy.
886.325	There's a woman named Esther Chávez
886.325	who I met in Juarez, Mexico.
889.841	And Esther Chávez was
889.841	a brilliant accountant in Mexico City.
893.1	She was 72 years old
893.1	and she was planning to retire.
896.527	She went to Juarez
896.527	to take care of an ailing aunt,
900.125	and in the course of it, she began
900.125	to discover what was happening
903.221	to the murdered and disappeared
903.221	women of Juarez.
906.614	She gave up her life; she moved to Juarez.
909.36	She started to write the stories
909.36	which documented the disappeared women.
	town because they're brown and poor.
917.116	There has been no response
917.116	to the disappearance,
919.402	and not one person
919.402	has been held accountable.
921.663	She began to document it.
923.201	She opened a center called
923.201	Casa Amiga, and in six years,
926.804	she has literally brought this
926.804	to the consciousness of the world.
930.188	We were there a week ago,
931.601	when there were 7,000 people
931.601	in the street, and it was truly a miracle.
935.311	And as we walked through the streets,
937.175	the people of Juarez, who normally
937.175	don't even come into the streets,
940.41	because the streets are so dangerous,
942.212	literally stood there and wept,
943.848	to see that other people
943.848	from the world had showed up
946.413	for that particular community.
948.81	There's another woman, named Agnes.
950.557	And Agnes, for me, epitomizes
950.557	what a vagina warrior is.
955.242	I met her three years ago in Kenya.
958.016	And Agnes was mutilated as a little girl;
961	she was circumcised against her will
961	when she was 10 years old,
965.633	and she really made a decision
967.157	that she didn't want this practice
967.157	to continue anymore in her community.
971	So when she got older,
971	she created this incredible thing:
974.135	it's an anatomical sculpture
974.135	of a woman's body, half a woman's body.
979.452	And she walked through the Rift Valley,
981.604	and she had vagina
981.604	and vagina replacement parts,
985	where she would teach girls
985	and parents and boys and girls
987.853	what a healthy vagina looks like,
987.853	and what a mutilated vagina looks like.
991.333	And in the course of her travel --
993	she walked literally for eight years
993	through the Rift Valley,
996.063	through dust, through sleeping
996.063	on the ground,
998.348	because the Maasai are nomads,
1000.547	and she would have to find them,
1000.547	and they would move,
1004	and she would find them again --
1005.662	she saved 1,500 girls from being cut.
1008.946	And in that time, she created
1008.946	an alternative ritual,
1011.551	which involved girls
1011.551	coming of age without the cut.
1014.9	When we met her three years ago,
1017	"we said, ""What could V-Day do for you?"""
1018.937	"And she said, ""Well, if you got me a jeep,"
1018.937	"I could get around a lot faster."""
1022.577	(Laughter)
1023.602	So we bought her a jeep.
1024.941	And in the year that she had the jeep,
1024.941	she saved 4,500 girls from being cut.
1029.55	So we said to her,
1029.55	"""What else could we do for you?"""
1032.036	"She said, ""Well, Eve,"
1032.036	if you gave me some money,
1034.322	I could open a house
1034.322	and girls could run away,
1036.496	"and they could be saved."""
1038.224	And I want to tell this little story
1038.224	about my own beginnings,
1041.129	because it's very interrelated
1041.129	to happiness and Agnes.
1045.447	When I was a little girl --
1045.447	I grew up in a wealthy community;
1049.155	it was an upper-middle class
1049.155	white community,
1052.4	and it had all the trappings and the looks
1055.283	of a perfectly nice,
1055.283	wonderful, great life.
1059.259	And everyone was supposed
1059.259	to be happy in that community,
1061.91	and, in fact, my life was hell.
1063.515	I lived with an alcoholic father
1065.072	who beat me and molested me,
1065.072	and it was all inside that.
1068	And always as a child I had this fantasy
1068	that somebody would come and rescue me.
1073	And I actually made up a little character
1073	whose name was Mr. Alligator.
1076.644	I would call him up
1076.644	when things got really bad,
1079	and say it was time
1079	to come and pick me up.
1081.187	And I would pack a little bag
1081.187	and wait for Mr. Alligator to come.
1085	Now, Mr. Alligator never did come,
1087.206	but the idea of Mr. Alligator coming
1087.206	actually saved my sanity
1091.704	and made it OK for me to keep going,
1093.49	because I believed, in the distance,
1095.245	there would be someone
1095.245	coming to rescue me.
1098	Cut to 40-some odd years later,
1100.493	we go to Kenya, and we're walking,
1103.747	we arrive at the opening of this house.
1106.49	And Agnes hadn't let me come
1106.49	to the house for days,
1108.931	because they were preparing
1108.931	this whole ritual.
1111.108	I want to tell you a great story.
1112.722	When Agnes first started fighting
1114.368	to stop female genital mutilation
1114.368	in her community,
1116.893	she had become an outcast,
1116.893	and she was exiled and slandered,
1120.456	and the whole community
1120.456	turned against her.
1122.511	But being a vagina warrior,
1122.511	she kept going,
1124.893	and she kept committing herself
1124.893	to transforming consciousness.
1128.266	And in the Maasai community,
1129.898	goats and cows are the most
1129.898	valued possession.
1132.723	They're like the Mercedes-Benz
1132.723	of the Rift Valley.
1137	And she said two days
1137	before the house opened,
1139.91	two different people arrived
1139.91	to give her a goat each,
1142.797	and she said to me,
1143.972	"""I knew then that female genital"
1143.972	"mutilation would end one day in Africa."""
1148.786	Anyway, we arrived, and when we arrived,
1152.508	there were hundreds of girls
1152.508	dressed in red homemade dresses --
1156.262	which is the color of the Maasai
1156.262	and the color of V-Day --
1159.196	and they greeted us.
1160.562	They had made up these songs
1160.562	that they were singing,
1163.038	about the end of suffering
1163.038	and the end of mutilation,
1165.615	and they walked us down the path.
1167.334	It was a gorgeous day in the African sun,
1169.723	and the dust was flying
1169.723	and the girls were dancing,
1172.2	and there was this house, and it said,
1172.2	"""V-Day Safe House for the Girls."""
1176.75	And it hit me in that moment
1176.75	that it had taken 47 years,
1182.076	but that Mr. Alligator
1182.076	had finally shown up.
1185.219	And he had shown up, obviously,
1187.125	in a form that it took me
1187.125	a long time to understand,
1190.545	which is that when we give in the world
1190.545	what we want the most,
1195.675	we heal the broken part inside each of us.
1199.483	And I feel, in the last eight years,
1201.881	that this journey --
1201.881	this miraculous vagina journey --
1205	has taught me this really simple thing,
1207.826	which is that happiness exists in action;
1212.273	it exists in telling the truth
1212.273	and saying what your truth is;
1216.432	and it exists in giving away
1216.432	what you want the most.
1220	And I feel that knowledge and that journey
1224	has been an extraordinary privilege,
1226.477	and I feel really blessed
1228.095	to have been here today
1228.095	to communicate that to you.
1230.539	Thank you very much.
1231.728	(Applause)
