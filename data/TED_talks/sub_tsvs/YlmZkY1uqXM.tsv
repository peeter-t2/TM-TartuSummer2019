12.694	First of all, for those of you who
14.074	are not familiar with my work,
16.413	I create multicultural characters,
19.215	so characters from lots of different backgrounds.
22.14	So before the present is the new future,
24.397	a bit about the past is that I grew up in a family
27.839	that was multi-everything -- multi-racial, multi-cultural,
30.478	black and white, Caribbean,
33.059	Irish-American, German-American.
34.844	There was Dominican
34.844	music blasting from stereos.
39.028	There were Christians and Jews.
41.91	That's a long story filled with
43.73	intrigue and interfaith guilt and shame.
46.412	But I was totally immersed in this world
50.9	that was filled with everybody,
52.962	and then I went on to the United Nations school,
56.002	and that just completely —
57.688	So I began sort of developing these voices
61.771	and these people,
63.657	all of whom were loosely based
63.657	on people I really know,
66.027	and so, for example, in performing them,
70.21	I would really try to inhabit them.
72.168	And for example,
73.525	I don't really talk like that,
75.7	but that was one of my people,
78.494	and I'm going to bring a few of my friends --
81.578	I think of them as my friends —
83.13	to this stage, in this spirit of the idea
85.612	that the present is the new future,
88.004	in sort of a meta way,
89.96	because I thought about it, and the future, for me,
91.95	what can be so frightening
93.428	is that I don't know what's coming.
95.394	I don't know if that's true for other people,
96.856	but that notion of thinking about
99.144	how we can understand the future
102.327	and predict outcomes,
103.998	for me, it's terrifying to not
103.998	know what might be coming.
108.392	And so the idea that there are questions
110.85	that I've never seen
112.37	that my people are going to answer,
114.846	and some of these characters
114.846	have been with me for ages,
116.586	some of them don't even have names,
118.34	I don't know what's going to happen.
119.91	I don't know what's coming,
121.608	and all I can do is remind myself
124.403	that I told Chris I'd fly by the seat of my pants,
126.734	and now that I'm up here it sort of feels like
128.608	that dream where you don't have any pants on,
131.308	and so I suppose I'm going to be
133.08	flying by the seat of my ass.
136.507	That said, let's just see who comes out.
138.405	May we have the first question:
139.84	"""Do you ever get headaches"
141.024	"from the microchips implanted in your brain?"""
143.582	Right.
146.86	Okay.
148.46	Well first of all, I'll just say
151.46	that I hope you can hear me okay.
153.976	My name is Lorraine Levine,
156.116	and the idea of microchips implanted in my brain,
162.09	frankly, just putting on my glasses reminds me
167.41	of thank God I'm not wearing the Google Glasses.
170.14	No offense to them. I'm glad that you all enjoy them,
173.328	but at my age,
174.904	just putting on the regular ones I have
177.118	already gives me too much information.
179.724	Do you understand what I'm saying to you?
181.95	I don't need to know more. I don't want to know.
184.89	That's it. That's enough.
186.54	I love you all. You're wonderful.
188.649	It's fabulous to be here with such big machers
191.402	again this year. Mwah!
194.393	Okay, next question. (Applause)
197.919	Next, please.
199.896	"""Is dating boring,"
200.992	"now that humans reproduce asexually?"""
203.576	Who do we got?
207.436	Hi, um, okay, hi everybody.
210.276	My name is Nereida.
211.82	I just want to say first of all
213.148	that dating is never boring under any circumstance.
215.67	But I am very excited to be here right now,
217.39	so I am just trying to remind myself that,
219.804	you know, like, the purpose
219.804	of being here and everything,
221.589	I mean, trying to answer these
221.589	questions, it is very exciting.
224.294	But I also, I just need to acknowledge
226.19	that TED is an incredible experience right now
228.782	in the present, like, I just need to say, like,
230.732	Isabel Allende. Isabel Allende!
232.972	Okay, maybe it doesn't mean,
234.544	of course it means something to you,
235.84	but to me, it's like, another level, okay?
237.4	Because I'm Latina and I really appreciate the fact
239.459	that there are role models here that I can really,
242.317	I don't know, I just need to say that.
243.815	That's incredible to me, and sometimes
243.815	when I'm nervous and everything like that,
246.593	I just need to, like, say some affirmations
248.933	that can help me.
251.337	I usually just try to use, like, the three little words
253.395	that always make me feel better:
255.879	Sotomayor, Sotomayor, Sotomayor. (Laughter)
258.86	Just, it really helps me to get grounded.
260.617	Now I can use Allende, Allende, Allende,
262.914	and, you know, I just need to say it, like,
264.48	it's so incredible to be here, and I knew
264.48	that we were going to have these questions.
266.914	I was so nervous and I was thinking
266.914	just, like, oh my God, oh my God,
269.167	and reminding me, because
269.167	I've had, like, some very,
271.144	especially since the last time we were here at TED,
272.737	it was, like, unbelievable,
274.063	and then right after that, like,
275.267	so many crazy things happened, like,
276.221	we ended up going to the White House to perform.
277.965	That was, like, amazing,
279.189	and I'm standing there,
280.209	"and I was just like, please don't say, ""Oh my God."""
281.719	"Don't say, ""Oh my God."""
282.473	"And I just kept saying it: ""Oh my God. Oh my God."""
284.48	And, you know, I kept thinking to myself, like,
286.416	President Obama has to come
286.416	up here at the same podium,
289.171	"and I'm standing here saying, ""Oh my God."""
290.511	It's like, the separation of church and state.
291.864	It's just, I couldn't, like, I couldn't process.
293.781	It was really too much.
294.946	So I think I've lost my way.
296.9	But what I wanted to say is that dating, for me,
299.675	you know, as far as I'm concerned,
301.421	however you reproduce, as long
301.421	as you're enjoying yourself
304.04	and it's with another consenting
304.04	asexual -- I don't know.
308.11	You know where I'm going with that.
309.43	Okay, ciao, gracias.
311.501	Okay, next question. (Applause)
314.023	What are your top five favorite songs right now?
322.472	All right, well first of all, I'mma say,
324.5	you know what I'm saying, I'm
324.5	the only dude up here right now.
327.84	My name is Rashid,
329.479	and I never been at TED before,
331.902	you know what I'm saying.
332.737	I think, Sarah Jones, maybe she
332.737	didn't want me to come out last time.
336.029	I don't know why. You know what I'm saying.
338.012	Obviously I would be like a perfect fit for TED.
340.566	You know what I'm saying.
342.898	First of all, that I'm in hip hop,
342.898	you know what I'm saying.
345.235	I know some of y'all may be not really
347.071	as much into the music,
348.255	but the first way y'all can always know,
350.253	you know what I'm saying, that I'm in hip hop,
352.257	is 'cos I hold the microphone
354.735	in an official emcee posture.
356.487	Y'all can see that right there.
357.615	That's how you hold it.
359.193	All right, so you get your little tutorial right there.
361.261	But when Sarah Jones told me
361.261	we was gonna come up here,
364.16	I was like, betch, you know what I'm saying,
365.737	TED is real fly, I got a whole lot of dope,
367.993	you know what I'm saying,
367.993	shit going on and everything,
370.217	but she was like, yeah,
371.189	we're going to have to answer,
371.189	like, some random questions,
374.147	just like, and I was like, what the hell is that?
375.805	You know what I'm saying, just stand up there
377.135	and answer some random questions?
378.64	I don't want to,
379.675	I mean, it's like an intellectual stop-and-frisk.
381.733	You know what I'm saying? (Laughter)
382.909	I don't want to be standing up there just
384.615	all getting interrogated and whatnot.
386.539	That's what I'm trying to leave behind
387.607	in New York. You know what I'm saying?
389.215	So anyway, I would have to say
389.215	my top five songs right now
392.687	is all out of my own personal catalogue,
395.201	you know what I mean?
396.678	So if you want to know more about that,
398.155	you know what I'm saying,
399.059	we could talk about the anti-piracy and all that,
401.526	but as far as I'm concerned,
403.051	you know, I believe in creative commons,
404.867	and I think it's really important that, you know,
407.597	that needs to be sustainable and everything,
409.933	and I mean, as far as I'm concerned,
412.617	I mean, this right here,
413.883	this environment, I would like to sustain.
415.717	You know what I mean?
417.101	But I'm just saying, if y'all are interested
419.565	in the top five songs, you need to holler at me.
421.593	You know what I'm saying?
423.161	Aight? In the future or the present. Yeah.
425.483	Enjoy the rest of it.
427.04	Okay, next question.
429.231	What do you got?
430.893	"""How many of your organs have been 3D printed?"""
432.821	(Laughter)
436.851	Well I have to say that I don't know about
438.969	how many of my organs
440.256	have been 3-D printed as such,
442.835	but I can tell you that it is so challenging to me,
445.99	kind of thinking about this concept of the future
448.334	and that, you know, all around the world
451.007	parents are kind of telling their small children,
455.07	please, you have to eat that, you know,
456.547	I have slaved over a hot 3D printer all day
459.271	so that you can have this meal.
460.91	You know, that kind of thing.
463.515	And of course now that we have changed, you know,
466.375	from the global South, there is this total
468.303	kind of perspective shift that is happening around the --
471.967	You can't just say to them,
473.213	well, there are starving children.
475.04	Well, it is the future.
475.991	Nobody is starving anymore, thank God.
479.091	But as you can tell I have kind of that optimism,
483.164	and I do hope that we can continue
485.428	to kind of 3D print,
487.221	well, let us just say I like to think that
489.695	even in the future we will have the publication,
492.109	kind of, you know, all the food that's fit to print.
495.955	But everybody, please do enjoy that,
498.227	and again, I think that you do throw
500.27	a cracking good party here at TED.
502.107	Thank you.
504.037	Next question. (Applause)
508.327	What has changed? Okay, it's like,
515.421	I have to think about that.
517.743	"""What has changed now that women run the world?"""
522.444	First of all,
524.388	I really, like, I just want to say,
526.271	and my name is Bella,
527.733	I just want to, like, identify myself,
530.155	that, like, as a feminist,
533.825	I, like, I really find that, like,
538.657	because I was born in the '90s,
541.13	and, like, there were a lot of women who were
546.439	as far as feminism was concerned,
548.62	like, maybe they didn't understand that, like,
551.306	a feminist like me, like,
554.706	I don't think it's required that you have to have
557.354	a certain kind of voice,
559.384	or, like, a certain way of presenting yourself
562.027	to be feminist, because I think that, like,
563.62	feminism can be really hot,
566.37	and I think actually that it's really vital and important.
569.764	Like, the quotation I'm wearing is from, like,
572.17	Gloria Steinem,
573.674	and, like, I'm named Bella for, like, Bella Abzug,
577.51	who's, like, obviously, like, a really
577.51	important feminist from, like, history,
581.512	and like, I just think that those women, like,
585.07	really represent, like, that you can, like,
587.86	be vital and, like, amazing,
590.486	like, a-mazing,
592.273	and you don't have to wear, like,
593.83	an Eileen Fisher caftan,
596.565	just to, like, prove that you are a feminist.
599.36	Like, not that there's anything wrong with that,
602.193	but my mom, she's like, like,
605.031	why do you have to wear pants that, like,
609.17	objectify your body? I like my pants.
612.625	Like, I like my voice.
615.626	Like, she's like, why do you have to talk like —
617.857	Talk like what? Like, I'm expressing myself,
621.321	and I think that we have to, like,
622.993	reach out, like, not only across, like,
625.87	the different generations of feminists,
629.161	but also across the, like, vocal ranges,
634.496	so that, like, we,
637.537	because otherwise it's just, like,
639.948	restriculous within feminism,
642.417	which is just, like, a word that I created
645.789	that means, like, so strict it's ridiculous.
648.961	So that's my feeling about that.
650.993	You guys are a-mazing, by the way.
653.873	Okay. Next question.
656.983	(Applause)
658.601	"[""They've discovered a cure for cancer,"
658.601	"but not baldness? What's up with that?""]"
663.749	Yeah, you know what,
665.215	so my name is Joseph Mancuso.
667.439	First of all, I just want to say that I appreciate
670.743	that TED in general has been a pretty orderly crowd,
673.693	a pretty orderly group.
677.123	And, you know, I just have to say,
679.632	the whole thing with baldness,
681.932	and, you know, here's the thing.
686.733	As long as the woman, in my case --
690.288	because it's a modern world,
691.425	do whatever you want to do, I don't
691.425	have any problem with anybody,
694.328	enjoy yourself, LGBTQLMNOP. All right?
699.195	But as far as I'm concerned,
702.182	attractiveness,
703.595	women don't really care
705.745	as much as you think they do
707.848	about the, you know.
709.242	I mean, I remember hearing this woman.
710.617	She loved her husband, it was the sweetest thing.
713.459	It's a pretty young girl, you know?
715.304	And this guy's older.
716.845	And, you know, she said she would love him
720.05	even if he had snow on the roof
722.26	or even if melted and disappeared altogether.
726.26	As far as I'm concerned, it's about the love.
728.88	Am I right, or am I right?
730.542	So that's it. That's it. That's it.
732.528	I don't got nothing more to say.
733.304	Keep your noses clean.
735.022	All right, next question.
739.476	"""Have you ever tasted meat that's not lab grown?"""
746.057	Um, well, I,
750.61	I want to start by saying
752.73	that this is a very difficult experience
757.248	for a Chinese-American.
762.564	I don't know what to call myself now,
765.637	because I have really my Chinese identity,
769.951	but my kids, they are American-Chinese,
776.112	but it's difficult to try to express myself
780.503	in front of audience of people like this.
786.295	But if had to give my opinion about meat,
793.657	I think first, the most important thing is to say
798.621	that we don't have to have perfect food,
804.369	but maybe it can also not be poison.
809.299	Maybe we can have some middle ground for that.
814.395	But I will continue to consider this idea,
818.113	and I will report back maybe next year.
822.879	Next.
824.129	Next. Next. (Applause)
827.197	"""Will there ever be a post-racial world?"""
834.387	Thank you for having me.
836.771	My name is Gary Weaselhead. Enjoy that.
841.791	I'm a member of the Blackfeet Nation.
844.111	I'm also half Lakota, but that is my given name,
848.122	and no, even though it would have seemed
851.411	like an obvious choice,
852.987	no, I did not go into politics.
858.058	Tough crowd.
859.302	(Laughter)
860.312	But I always like to just let people know
863.575	when they ask about race or those kinds of things,
867.432	you know, as a member of
867.432	the First Nations community,
872.168	you know, I'm probably
876.048	not your typical guy.
877.8	For example, in addition to being an activist,
880.773	I'm also a professional stand-up comedian.
884.908	(Laughter)
888.348	And, you know, I'm most popular
893.764	on college and university campuses.
895.787	You know, whenever they want to do a diversity day,
900.424	or hey-we're-not-all-white week,
906.31	then I'm there. (Laughter)
908.418	Do I think there will ever be a post-racial world?
912.1	I think, really, I can't talk about race
915.121	without remembering that it is a construct
918.19	in certain respects,
920.381	but also that, you know,
922.907	until we redress the wrongs of the past,
926.493	we're going to be turned around.
928.041	I don't care if the present is the new future.
932.01	I think there's a lot of great people here at TED
933.716	who are working to address that,
935.822	so with that, if anything I've said today
939.06	makes you feel uncomfortable, you're welcome.
942.468	(Applause)
945.355	I think we have time for one more.
949.162	"""What's the most popular diet these days?"""
952.637	Who's here?
954.445	Okay, well, I'm just gonna answer this really fast,
956.497	as, like, three or four different people.
958.223	I mean really fast.
959.32	I'm just gonna let y'all know that,
959.32	as far as diet is concerned,
962.305	if you don't love yourself inside,
964.99	there is no diet on this Earth
967.289	that is going to make your behind small enough
970.28	for you to feel good,
971.65	so just stop wasting your time.
975.29	I would just like to say as an African woman
977.02	that I believe the diet that we need
980.12	is really to remove the crazy belief
984.39	that there is anything wrong
986.406	with a nice backside.
987.66	No, I am teasing about that.
989.539	There is nothing wrong with a woman of size.
991.834	That is what I am trying to say.
993.859	Women, celebrate your body, for God's sake.
996.915	Stop running around starving.
998.792	You are making yourselves
998.792	and other people miserable.
1002.653	Last answer.
1006.273	So we're talking about what's the most popular diet?
1010.765	I'm gonna start off by telling y'all that
1014.521	this is my first time here at TED.
1018.922	I might not be your typical person
1021.515	you find on this stage.
1023.84	My dental work not as nice as some people.
1027.103	But I made Sarah Jones promise
1029.162	she gonna bring me this time,
1031.318	'cause she didn't bring me before,
1036.318	but you know, I just want to say,
1038.21	there's a lot of things more important
1039.67	than counting calories,
1042.57	and as somebody living on the streets in New York,
1045.898	and getting to come here,
1045.898	hear y'all ideas worth spreading,
1050.217	I want to tell y'all I believe in this idea
1052.584	that the present is the new future,
1054.7	that where you sit, you create everything
1057.896	that's gonna come, for better or worse.
1060.91	And for me, I think homeless
1063.53	is the wrong word for it anyway.
1065.642	You know, I might not have me no place
1067.509	to lay my head at night,
1069.208	but that just makes me houseless.
1072.509	I have me a home. You do too.
1074.85	Find it and try to find yourself in there.
1079.073	Make sure you know,
1080.602	it's not just about virtual reality in space.
1085.19	That's wonderful, but it's also about
1086.832	the actual reality here on Earth.
1089.526	How are people living today?
1090.998	How can you be part of the solution?
1093.368	Thank y'all for thinking about that
1095.217	right now in the present moment
1096.796	to influence the future.
1098.529	I appreciate it. Bye-bye.
1100.584	(Applause)
1103.102	Thank you all very, very much.
1106.474	Thank you for trusting me, Chris.
1108.642	(Applause)
