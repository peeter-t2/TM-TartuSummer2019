13.018	I'm going to tell you the story of a song.
15.684	I was in Madrid one night in 2002
20.102	with my teacher and friend Joaquín Sabina,
22.429	when he said he had something to give me.
25.419	He said,
26.785	"""Jorge, I have some lines"
26.785	that you need to put into a song.
30.166	"Take these down, take these down."""
31.849	I looked on the table but all I found
31.849	was a circular coaster,
34.877	on which I wrote the lines
34.877	my teacher dictated.
37.253	They were four lines that went like this:
39.75	"""I am a Jewish Moor"
39.75	living among Christians
43.111	I don't know who my God is,
43.111	"nor who my brothers are."""
48.177	Those lines really made
48.177	an impression on me.
51.222	"I said, ""What beautiful lyrics,"
51.222	"Joaquín. Did you write them?"""
54.23	He said no, they were by another composer
54.23	named Chicho Sánchez Ferlosio,
59.732	who was less known than Joaquín,
59.732	but also a great poet.
63.552	These lines came to me at a time
65.136	where I had been wanting
65.136	to express something for a while,
67.966	but didn't quite know how.
69.63	I was getting up to leave
69.63	and go home to write,
72.54	when Joaquín stopped me
72.54	"and said, ""Hang on, hang on,"""
75.054	and presented me with this challenge:
77.802	"""Write the stanzas for this song"
80.821	"in Décimas."""
82.906	Now, at this point in my life,
85.421	I still wasn't completely
85.421	sure what Décimas were,
89.217	but I was too embarrassed
89.217	to tell my teacher I didn't know.
93.503	So I put on my best
93.503	"""Yeah, I totally understand"" face,"
97.212	and went home to look up
97.212	what Décimas were.
99.975	I learned that a Décima is a type of verse
103.479	that only exists in Spanish,
104.918	and that it has 10 lines.
106.206	It's very, very complex --
108.231	perhaps the most complex style of stanza
108.231	that we have in Spanish.
111.425	It also has a very concrete
111.425	date of origin,
113.908	which is very rare for a style of stanza.
116.266	The Décima was invented in Spain in 1591,
121.513	by a guy named Vicente Espinel,
121.513	a musician and poet from Málaga.
127.268	And listen to this coincidence:
127.268	he was the same guy
130.742	who added the sixth string
132.458	to what would later be called
132.458	the Spanish guitar.
134.785	This string right here --
136.175	"it's called the ""bordona."""
138.424	From Spain, the Décima, with its 10 lines,
141.892	crosses over to America,
141.892	just like the Spanish guitar,
146.723	but in contrast to the Décima,
148.277	the Spanish guitar continues to live today
150.75	on both sides of the Atlantic.
152.463	But the Décima, in Spain, its birthplace,
155.579	disappeared; it died out.
158.033	It died out about 200 years ago,
160.376	and yet in Latin America,
160.376	from Mexico to Chile,
165.064	all our countries maintain
165.064	some form of the Décima
169.042	in our popular traditions.
172.151	In each place, they've given it
172.151	a different name,
174.489	and set it to different music.
176.576	It has a lot of different names --
176.576	more than 20 in total on the continent.
181.535	In Mexico, for example,
181.535	"it's called the ""Son Jarocho,"""
184.653	"""Canto de mejorana"" in Panama;"
186.482	"""Galerón"" in Venezuela;"
188.06	"""Payada"" in Uruguay and Argentina;"
191.117	"""Repentismo"" in Cuba."
192.555	In Peru, they call it the Peruvian Décima,
194.861	because the Décima becomes
194.861	so integrated into our traditions,
197.984	that if someone asks, people
197.984	from each place are completely convinced
201.541	that the Décima was invented
201.541	in their country.
204.32	(Laughter)
205.693	It's also got a really surprising feature,
207.868	which is that despite the fact
207.868	that it developed independently
211.161	in each of the different countries,
213.222	it maintains even today,
217.624	exactly the same rhyme,
217.624	syllable and line structure --
224.816	the same structure Vicente Espinel gave it
224.816	during the Spanish Baroque period.
228.547	Here's the structure --
229.752	I'll give you the basic idea
229.752	and then later you can look online
232.802	and learn more about it.
234.946	The Décima is ten lines long;
234.946	each line has eight syllables.
239.781	The first line rhymes
239.781	with the fourth and the fifth;
242.28	the second line, with the third;
243.852	the sixth line,
243.852	with the seventh and the tenth;
246.683	and the eighth line rhymes with the ninth.
249.141	It's a bit complicated, to be honest.
251.952	And me -- imagine me,
251.952	trying to write in Décimas.
256.027	But it's not as complicated as it seems.
258.883	Plus, it's amazing that it's survived
258.883	with the same structure
262.068	for more than four centuries.
264.68	It's not that complicated, because it has
264.68	an impressive musicality to it,
268.176	a type of musicality
270.616	that's very hard to describe technically.
273.916	I prefer that you listen to it.
275.533	So I'm going to recite a Décima,
279.102	one of the Décimas
279.102	that I wrote for this song.
284.94	I'm going to ask that you concentrate
284.94	just on the musicality of the rhymes.
289.932	For those of you with headphones on --
291.873	I see that some of you are listening
291.873	to the translation --
297.512	please take them off for a minute.
299.601	(English) Take your headphones off,
299.601	it you have them.
303.228	(English) Forget about the meaning
303.228	of the words for a few seconds,
309.269	(English) and then you'll put them back.
311.264	(English) Forget about the structure.
313.094	(Spanish) Forget about the structure.
314.906	(English) And just ... it's all about
314.906	the choreography of sound of the Décima.
320.172	(Spanish) A choreography of sound.
324.572	"(Sings in Spanish) ""There is not one death"
324.572	that does not cause me pain,
328.008	there are no winners,
329.069	here’s nothing but suffering
329.069	and another life blown away.
332.011	War is a terrible school
332.011	no matter what the disguise,
335.412	forgive me for not enlisting
335.412	under any flag,
338.334	any daydream is worth more
338.334	"than a sad piece of cloth."""
345.841	That's a Décima.
347.971	(English) You can put
347.971	your headphones back on.
350.302	(Applause)
351.404	(English) Thank you.
352.581	(Applause)
357.176	I also applaud Vicente Espinel,
357.176	because here it is 426 years later,
360.499	and the Décima lives on everywhere
362.25	in its original state.
363.472	I wrote three like that one;
363.472	you just heard the second.
366.096	I wrote the first one having only
366.096	recently learned how,
368.794	and it has some errors in terms of meter,
370.923	so it's not presentable
370.923	in its current state.
373.112	But the one I sang was good, more or less.
375.755	So: What was it about?
379.292	What was the meaning behind those lines?
381.534	I had just returned from doing
381.534	a concert in Israel,
385.993	and I was very emotional over a problem
385.993	that hits really close to home,
389.734	which is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
391.825	I'll explain: my dad's family is Jewish,
393.972	and my mom's family
393.972	are non-practicing Christians.
396.869	I was raised in a home
396.869	where the two traditions lived together
401.452	more or less in harmony.
404.608	It wasn't unusual to see my Jewish grandpa
404.608	dressed as Santa Claus, for example,
408.419	or to see my non-Jewish grandpa
408.419	at the synagogue wearing his kippah,
411.681	at family celebrations, wearing the same
411.681	expression that I probably had
415.12	when Sabina told me --
416.507	(Laughter)
417.571	that he had some Décima lines for me.
421.986	For someone raised
421.986	in that kind of environment,
425.641	it's especially painful to see
425.641	the difficulty the opposing parties have
430.876	in putting themselves in the other
430.876	side's shoes even for a moment.
434.087	So that's what I wrote about.
436.223	I already had the lyrics,
437.497	I had the form -- the Décima --
437.497	and the content.
440.947	I needed to write the music.
443.96	I'll give you some context.
445.414	I had only recently moved from Uruguay,
445.414	where I'm from, to Spain.
450.113	And I was feeling very raw with nostalgia,
452.959	like many of you here,
452.959	who are away from home.
456.91	And I wanted my song
456.91	to be very, very Uruguayan,
460.384	the most Uruguayan type of song
460.384	there is -- the milonga.
464.13	So now, I had been studying the Décima,
464.13	and after finding out
469.643	that everyone tried to claim
469.643	the Décima as their own,
472.227	that it was invented in their country,
474.119	it made me wonder:
475.297	What does it mean when we say
475.297	the milonga is Uruguayan?
477.936	The milonga has a rhythmic pattern
477.936	that we musicians call 3-3-2.
484.13	(Counts out the beats) One two three,
484.13	one two three, one two.
491.738	And it has a characteristic emphasis.
494.263	(Sings)
502.744	But this characteristic rhythm pattern
505.499	comes from Africa.
507.4	In the ninth century you could find it
507.4	in the brothels of Persia,
510.534	and in the thirteenth,
513.151	in Spain, from where,
513.151	five centuries later,
515.837	it would cross over to America
515.837	with the African slaves.
519.697	Meanwhile, in the Balkans,
519.697	it encounters the Roma scale --
524.098	(Sings)
531.389	which in part, gives birth
531.389	to klezmer music,
534.902	which Ukrainian Jewish immigrants
534.902	bring to Brooklyn, New York.
539.668	They sing it in their banquet halls.
542.531	"(Sings ""Hava Nagila"")"
549.305	And their neighbor,
549.305	an Argentine kid of Italian origin
552.255	named Astor Piazzolla,
554.545	hears it,
556.587	assimilates it
558.138	and transforms the tango
558.138	of the second half of the 20th century
561.163	with his ...
562.34	(Counts out the beats) One two three,
562.34	one two three, one two.
565.845	"(Sings ""Adios Nonino"")"
573.934	He also played it on his bandoneon,
573.934	a 19th-century German instrument
578.649	created for churches
578.649	that couldn't afford to buy organs,
582.8	and that ends up, incredibly,
582.8	in Río de la Plata,
585.191	forming the very essence
585.191	of the tango and the milonga,
589.302	in the very same way another instrument
589.302	just as important as the bandoneon did:
594.345	the Spanish guitar.
595.92	(Applause)
608.277	To which, by the way,
608.277	Vicente Espinel, in the 16th century,
611.125	added a sixth string.
612.401	It's amazing how all these things
612.401	are coming full circle.
615.295	What have I learned in these 15 years
615.295	since the song was born
618.199	from going all over the world
618.199	with four lines written on a coaster
621.559	from a bar in Madrid?
624.373	That Décimas,
626.511	the milonga,
627.775	songs, people --
630.281	the closer you get to them,
632.258	the more complex their identity becomes,
635.425	and the more nuances and details appear.
638.638	I learned that identity
638.638	is infinitely dense,
641.811	like an infinite series of real numbers,
644.387	and that even if you get very close
646.159	and zoom in,
647.341	it never ends.
650.287	Before I sing you a song and say goodbye,
654.884	allow me to tell you one last story.
657.182	Not long ago, we were in Mexico
657.182	after a concert.
662.722	And since the concert promoters know me,
665.007	they knew I was a Décima freak
665.007	and that everywhere I go I ask about it,
668.955	insisting on hearing Décima artists.
670.717	So they organized a son jarocho show
670.717	for me at their house.
675.916	If you recall, the son jarocho
675.916	is one of the styles of music
680.555	that uses Décimas in its verses.
684.372	When these amazing musicians
684.372	finished playing
688.208	what is for me, something amazing,
688.208	which is the son jarocho,
691.11	they finished playing and were ...
692.799	I went up to greet them, really excited,
695.042	getting ready to thank them
695.042	for their gift of music,
699.31	and this young kid says to me --
703.263	and he says it with the best
703.263	of intentions -- he says,
706.157	"""We're very proud, sir, to be keeping"
706.157	alive the purest origins
713.145	"of our Mexican identity."""
716.238	And to tell you the truth,
716.238	I didn't really know what to say.
719.178	(Laughter)
720.231	I stood there looking at him.
720.231	I gave him a hug and left, but ...
723.42	(Laughter)
724.71	But he was right, too, though. Right?
726.719	In reality, the Décima is its origin,
726.719	but at the same time,
729.574	just like in the milonga
729.574	and in the Décima,
731.968	are the roots of many more cultures
731.968	from all over the place, like he said.
737.833	Later, when I got back to the hotel,
737.833	I thought about it for a while.
741.534	And I thought:
742.724	things only look pure
746.913	if you look at them from far away.
749.861	It's very important
749.861	to know about our roots,
753.23	to know where we come from,
753.23	to understand our history.
757.276	But at the same time, as important
757.276	as knowing where we're from,
760.298	is understanding that deep down,
763.898	we're all from nowhere
765.882	and a little bit from everywhere.
767.531	Thank you very much.
768.78	(Applause)
778.03	"This is ""The milonga of the Jewish Moor."""
