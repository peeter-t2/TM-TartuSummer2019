12.76	Let's imagine a sculptor
12.76	building a statue,
15.76	just chipping away with his chisel.
18.16	Michelangelo had this elegant way
18.16	of describing it when he said,
21.24	"""Every block of stone"
21.24	has a statue inside of it,
24.16	and it's the task
24.16	"of the sculptor to discover it."""
27.28	But what if he worked
27.28	in the opposite direction?
29.72	Not from a solid block of stone,
31.6	but from a pile of dust,
33.32	somehow gluing millions of these particles
33.32	together to form a statue.
37.72	I know that's an absurd notion.
39.24	It's probably impossible.
41	The only way you get
41	a statue from a pile of dust
43.96	is if the statue built itself --
46.32	if somehow we could compel millions
46.32	of these particles to come together
50.48	to form the statue.
52.32	Now, as odd as that sounds,
53.88	that is almost exactly the problem
53.88	I work on in my lab.
58.04	I don't build with stone,
59.48	I build with nanomaterials.
60.88	They're these just impossibly small,
60.88	fascinating little objects.
65.28	They're so small that if this controller
65.28	was a nanoparticle,
68.6	a human hair would be the size
68.6	of this entire room.
71.56	And they're at the heart of a field
71.56	we call nanotechnology,
74.4	which I'm sure we've all heard about,
76.239	and we've all heard
76.239	how it is going to change everything.
79.72	When I was a graduate student,
81.24	it was one of the most exciting times
81.24	to be working in nanotechnology.
84.6	There were scientific breakthroughs
84.6	happening all the time.
87.84	The conferences were buzzing,
89.28	there was tons of money
89.28	pouring in from funding agencies.
92.76	And the reason is
94.04	when objects get really small,
95.88	they're governed by a different set
95.88	of physics that govern ordinary objects,
99.52	like the ones we interact with.
101.04	We call this physics quantum mechanics.
103	And what it tells you is
103	that you can precisely tune their behavior
106.2	just by making seemingly
106.2	small changes to them,
108.52	like adding or removing
108.52	a handful of atoms,
111.16	or twisting the material.
112.88	It's like this ultimate toolkit.
114.68	You really felt empowered;
114.68	you felt like you could make anything.
117.8	And we were doing it --
119.08	and by we I mean my whole
119.08	generation of graduate students.
122.2	We were trying to make blazing fast
122.2	computers using nanomaterials.
125.72	We were constructing quantum dots
127.36	that could one day go in your body
127.36	and find and fight disease.
130.76	There were even groups
130.76	trying to make an elevator to space
133.8	using carbon nanotubes.
135.6	You can look that up, that's true.
138.776	Anyways, we thought it was going to affect
140.8	all parts of science and technology,
140.8	from computing to medicine.
143.92	And I have to admit,
145.2	I drank all of the Kool-Aid.
147.2	I mean, every last drop.
150.52	But that was 15 years ago,
153.16	and --
154.4	fantastic science was done,
154.4	really important work.
156.8	We've learned a lot.
158.08	We were never able to translate
158.08	that science into new technologies --
162.48	into technologies
162.48	that could actually impact people.
165.28	And the reason is, these nanomaterials --
167.52	they're like a double-edged sword.
169.2	The same thing that makes
169.2	them so interesting --
171.48	their small size --
172.8	also makes them impossible to work with.
175.12	It's literally like trying to build
175.12	a statue out of a pile of dust.
178.88	And we just don't have the tools
178.88	that are small enough to work with them.
182.6	But even if we did,
182.6	it wouldn't really matter,
184.92	because we couldn't one by one
184.92	place millions of particles together
188.84	to build a technology.
190.76	So because of that,
192	all of the promise
192	and all of the excitement
194.12	has remained just that:
194.12	promise and excitement.
196.92	We don't have any
196.92	disease-fighting nanobots,
199.32	there's no elevators to space,
201.4	and the thing that I'm most interested in,
201.4	no new types of computing.
205.12	Now that last one,
205.12	that's a really important one.
207.68	We just have come to expect
209.04	the pace of computing advancements
209.04	to go on indefinitely.
212.84	We've built entire economies on this idea.
215.44	And this pace exists
217.2	because of our ability
217.2	to pack more and more devices
219.68	onto a computer chip.
221.4	And as those devices get smaller,
223.24	they get faster, they consume less power
225.52	and they get cheaper.
226.96	And it's this convergence
226.96	that gives us this incredible pace.
231.56	As an example:
232.8	if I took the room-sized computer
232.8	that sent three men to the moon and back
238.24	and somehow compressed it --
240.4	compressed the world's
240.4	greatest computer of its day,
243.68	so it was the same size
243.68	as your smartphone --
246.28	your actual smartphone,
247.56	that thing you spent 300 bucks on
247.56	and just toss out every two years,
250.96	would blow this thing away.
253.44	You would not be impressed.
254.8	It couldn't do anything
254.8	that your smartphone does.
257.32	It would be slow,
258.84	you couldn't put any of your stuff on it,
261.04	you could possibly
261.04	get through the first two minutes
263.52	"of a ""Walking Dead"" episode"
263.52	if you're lucky --
265.72	(Laughter)
266.76	The point is the progress --
266.76	it's not gradual.
268.959	The progress is relentless.
270.68	It's exponential.
271.959	It compounds on itself year after year,
274.32	to the point where
274.32	if you compare a technology
276.52	from one generation to the next,
278.24	they're almost unrecognizable.
280.24	And we owe it to ourselves
280.24	to keep this progress going.
282.88	We want to say the same thing
286.52	look what we've done
286.52	over the last 30 years.
289.2	Yet we know this progress
289.2	may not last forever.
291.96	In fact, the party's kind of winding down.
294.04	"It's like ""last call for alcohol,"" right?"
296.4	If you look under the covers,
298.08	by many metrics
298.08	like speed and performance,
300.68	the progress has already slowed to a halt.
303.76	So if we want to keep this party going,
305.92	we have to do what we've
305.92	always been able to do,
308.2	and that is to innovate.
309.68	So our group's role
309.68	and our group's mission
312.28	is to innovate
312.28	by employing carbon nanotubes,
314.72	because we think that they can
314.72	provide a path to continue this pace.
318.8	They are just like they sound.
320.28	They're tiny, hollow tubes
320.28	of carbon atoms,
322.76	and their nanoscale size,
322.76	that small size,
325.72	gives rise to these
325.72	just outstanding electronic properties.
329.4	And the science tells us
329.4	if we could employ them in computing,
333.08	we could see up to a ten times
333.08	improvement in performance.
335.84	It's like skipping through several
335.84	technology generations in just one step.
340.84	So there we have it.
342.12	We have this really important problem
344.16	and we have what is basically
344.16	the ideal solution.
346.56	The science is screaming at us,
348.24	"""This is what you should be doing"
348.24	"to solve your problem."""
353.48	So, all right, let's get started,
355.12	let's do this.
356.4	But you just run right back
356.4	into that double-edged sword.
359.12	"This ""ideal solution"" contains a material"
359.12	that's impossible to work with.
362.72	I'd have to arrange billions of them
362.72	just to make one single computer chip.
367.04	It's that same conundrum,
367.04	it's like this undying problem.
371.36	"At this point, we said, ""Let's just stop."
373.36	Let's not go down that same road.
375.32	Let's just figure out what's missing.
377.88	What are we not dealing with?
379.32	What are we not doing
379.32	"that needs to be done?"""
381.48	"It's like in ""The Godfather,"" right?"
383.28	When Fredo betrays his brother Michael,
385.6	we all know what needs to be done.
387.28	Fredo's got to go.
388.64	(Laughter)
389.68	But Michael -- he puts it off.
391.64	Fine, I get it.
392.88	Their mother's still alive,
392.88	it would make her upset.
395.36	We just said,
396.8	"""What's the Fredo in our problem?"""
399.12	What are we not dealing with?
400.56	What are we not doing,
402.12	but needs to be done
402.12	"to make this a success?"""
405.2	And the answer is
405.2	that the statue has to build itself.
409.28	We have to find a way, somehow,
411.24	to compel, to convince
411.24	billions of these particles
415.36	to assemble themselves
415.36	into the technology.
418.36	We can't do it for them.
418.36	They have to do it for themselves.
421.56	And it's the hard way,
421.56	and this is not trivial,
424.72	but in this case, it's the only way.
427.6	Now, as it turns out,
427.6	this is not that alien of a problem.
431.52	We just don't build anything this way.
433.4	People don't build anything this way.
435.44	But if you look around --
435.44	and there's examples everywhere --
438.64	Mother Nature builds everything this way.
441.56	Everything is built from the bottom up.
444.24	You can go to the beach,
445.52	you'll find these simple organisms
445.52	that use proteins --
448.72	basically molecules --
450	to template what is essentially sand,
452.08	just plucking it from the sea
453.52	and building these extraordinary
453.52	architectures with extreme diversity.
456.92	And nature's not crude like us,
456.92	just hacking away.
459.56	She's elegant and smart,
461.28	building with what's available,
461.28	molecule by molecule,
464.04	making structures with a complexity
466.2	and a diversity
466.2	that we can't even approach.
469.32	And she's already at the nano.
471.04	She's been there
471.04	for hundreds of millions of years.
473.56	We're the ones that are late to the party.
476.12	So we decided that we're going
476.12	to use the same tool that nature uses,
480.32	and that's chemistry.
482	Chemistry is the missing tool.
483.48	And chemistry works in this case
485.56	because these nanoscale objects
485.56	are about the same size as molecules,
489.4	so we can use them
489.4	to steer these objects around,
492.04	much like a tool.
493.76	That's exactly what we've done in our lab.
495.84	We've developed chemistry
495.84	that goes into the pile of dust,
499.04	into the pile of nanoparticles,
500.56	and pulls out exactly the ones we need.
502.96	Then we can use chemistry to arrange
502.96	literally billions of these particles
506.6	into the pattern
506.6	we need to build circuits.
509.48	And because we can do that,
510.84	we can build circuits
510.84	that are many times faster
513.24	than what anyone's been able
513.24	to make using nanomaterials before.
516.48	Chemistry's the missing tool,
517.92	and every day our tool gets sharper
517.92	and gets more precise.
521.56	And eventually --
522.8	and we hope this is
522.8	within a handful of years --
525.44	we can deliver on one
525.44	of those original promises.
528.84	Now, computing is just one example.
530.919	It's the one that I'm interested in,
530.919	that my group is really invested in,
534.48	but there are others
534.48	in renewable energy, in medicine,
538.32	in structural materials,
540.08	where the science is going to tell you
540.08	to move towards the nano.
543.16	That's where the biggest benefit is.
545.92	But if we're going to do that,
547.4	the scientists of today and tomorrow
547.4	are going to need new tools --
550.6	tools just like the ones I described.
552.76	And they will need chemistry.
552.76	That's the point.
556.64	The beauty of science is that
556.64	once you develop these new tools,
560.32	they're out there.
561.6	They're out there forever,
562.88	and anyone anywhere
562.88	can pick them up and use them,
565.76	and help to deliver
565.76	on the promise of nanotechnology.
569.32	Thank you so much for your time.
569.32	I appreciate it.
572.04	(Applause)
