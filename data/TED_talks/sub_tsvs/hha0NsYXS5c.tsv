13.828	Today I'm going to speak to you
15.472	about the last 30 years
15.472	of architectural history.
19.685	That's a lot to pack into 18 minutes.
22.167	It's a complex topic,
23.878	so we're just going to dive right in
23.878	at a complex place:
28.276	New Jersey.
29.506	Because 30 years ago, I'm from Jersey,
32.72	and I was six, and I lived there
32.72	in my parents' house
36.586	in a town called Livingston,
38.234	and this was my childhood bedroom.
41.689	Around the corner from my bedroom
44.148	was the bathroom
44.148	that I used to share with my sister.
47.225	And in between my bedroom and the bathroom
50.162	was a balcony that overlooked
50.162	the family room.
53.413	And that's where everyone
53.413	would hang out and watch TV,
57.119	so that every time that I walked
57.119	from my bedroom to the bathroom,
61.306	everyone would see me,
62.666	and every time I took a shower
62.666	and would come back in a towel,
66.444	everyone would see me.
68.162	And I looked like this.
70.718	I was awkward,
73.765	insecure, and I hated it.
75.88	I hated that walk, I hated that balcony,
78.943	I hated that room, and I hated that house.
82.769	And that's architecture.
84.917	(Laughter)
86.258	Done.
88.088	That feeling, those emotions that I felt,
91.486	that's the power of architecture,
94.203	because architecture is not about math
94.203	and it's not about zoning,
97.765	it's about those visceral,
97.765	emotional connections
101.147	that we feel to the places that we occupy.
104.653	And it's no surprise
104.653	that we feel that way,
107.553	because according to the EPA,
109.785	Americans spend 90 percent
109.785	of their time indoors.
114.428	That's 90 percent of our time
114.428	surrounded by architecture.
119.188	That's huge.
120.72	That means that architecture is shaping us
120.72	in ways that we didn't even realize.
125.922	That makes us a little bit gullible
125.922	and very, very predictable.
131.464	It means that when I show you
131.464	a building like this,
134.117	I know what you think:
135.523	"You think ""power"""
135.523	"and ""stability"" and ""democracy."""
139.239	And I know you think that
139.239	because it's based on a building
142.896	that was build 2,500 years ago
142.896	by the Greeks.
146.272	This is a trick.
147.912	This is a trigger that architects use
150.104	to get you to create
150.104	an emotional connection
154.017	to the forms that we build
154.017	our buildings out of.
157.237	It's a predictable emotional connection,
159.901	and we've been using this trick
159.901	for a long, long time.
163.629	We used it [200] years ago to build banks.
166.926	We used it in the 19th century
166.926	to build art museums.
170.107	And in the 20th century in America,
172.336	we used it to build houses.
174.195	And look at these solid,
174.195	stable little soldiers
176.957	facing the ocean
176.957	and keeping away the elements.
180.265	This is really, really useful,
182.924	because building things is terrifying.
186.331	It's expensive, it takes a long time,
186.331	and it's very complicated.
190.996	And the people that build things --
193.178	developers and governments --
195.407	they're naturally afraid of innovation,
198.284	and they'd rather just use those forms
198.284	that they know you'll respond to.
203.125	That's how we end up
203.125	with buildings like this.
206.096	This is a nice building.
207.79	This is the Livingston Public Library
210.105	that was completed in 2004 in my hometown,
213.239	and, you know, it's got a dome
214.888	and it's got this round thing 
214.888	and columns, red brick,
218.495	and you can kind of guess what Livingston
218.495	is trying to say with this building:
223.509	children, property values and history.
227.751	But it doesn't have much to do
227.751	with what a library actually does today.
232.209	That same year, in 2004,
232.209	on the other side of the country,
236.297	another library was completed,
238.316	and it looks like this.
239.998	It's in Seattle.
242.14	This library is about how
242.14	we consume media in a digital age.
247.718	It's about a new kind
247.718	of public amenity for the city,
251.312	a place to gather and read and share.
255.244	So how is it possible
256.891	that in the same year,
256.891	in the same country,
260.328	two buildings, both called libraries,
262.975	look so completely different?
265.576	And the answer is that architecture works
265.576	on the principle of a pendulum.
271.501	On the one side is innovation,
274.393	and architects are constantly pushing,
274.393	pushing for new technologies,
278.034	new typologies, new solutions
278.034	for the way that we live today.
281.886	And we push and we push and we push
284.304	until we completely alienate all of you.
286.927	We wear all black, we get very depressed,
289.177	you think we're adorable,
291.362	we're dead inside because
291.362	we've got no choice.
294.845	We have to go to the other side
296.621	and reengage those symbols
296.621	that we know you love.
300.394	So we do that, and you're happy,
302.577	we feel like sellouts,
304.411	so we start experimenting again
306.085	and we push the pendulum back
306.085	and back and forth and back and forth
309.303	we've gone for the last 300 years,
311.702	and certainly for the last 30 years.
314.926	Okay, 30 years ago
314.926	we were coming out of the '70s.
318.542	Architects had been busy experimenting
318.542	with something called brutalism.
322.519	It's about concrete.
323.789	(Laughter)
325.285	You can guess this.
326.453	Small windows, dehumanizing scale.
329.807	This is really tough stuff.
332.594	So as we get closer to the '80s,
335.381	we start to reengage those symbols.
337.748	We push the pendulum
337.748	back into the other direction.
340.72	We take these forms that we know you love
343.553	and we update them.
345.142	We add neon
347.175	and we add pastels
349.463	and we use new materials.
351.141	And you love it.
352.603	And we can't give you enough of it.
354.576	We take Chippendale armoires
356.764	and we turned those into skyscrapers,
359.16	and skyscrapers can be
359.16	medieval castles made out of glass.
364.409	Forms got big,
365.985	forms got bold and colorful.
368.536	Dwarves became columns.
371.404	(Laughter)
372.467	Swans grew to the size of buildings.
374.597	It was crazy.
376.64	But it's the '80s, it's cool.
380.537	(Laughter)
381.739	We're all hanging out in malls
383.757	and we're all moving to the suburbs,
386.162	and out there, out in the suburbs,
388.76	we can create our own
388.76	architectural fantasies.
392.116	And those fantasies,
393.894	they can be Mediterranean
395.981	or French
397.93	or Italian.
399.154	(Laughter)
400.821	Possibly with endless breadsticks.
402.738	This is the thing about postmodernism.
404.788	This is the thing about symbols.
406.908	They're easy, they're cheap,
409.912	because instead of making places,
412.441	we're making memories of places.
415.091	Because I know, 
415.091	and I know all of you know,
417.971	this isn't Tuscany.
420.182	This is Ohio.
421.452	(Laughter)
422.994	So architects get frustrated,
424.843	and we start pushing the pendulum
424.843	back into the other direction.
428.559	In the late '80s and early '90s,
430.81	we start experimenting with something
430.81	called deconstructivism.
434.727	We throw out historical symbols,
437.497	we rely on new, computer-aided
437.497	design techniques,
441.367	and we come up with new compositions,
443.348	forms crashing into forms.
446.228	This is academic and heady stuff,
449.275	it's super unpopular,
451.15	we totally alienate you.
452.837	Ordinarily, the pendulum would just
452.837	swing back into the other direction.
457.048	And then, something amazing happened.
460.331	In 1997, this building opened.
463.898	This is the Guggenheim Bilbao,
463.898	by Frank Gehry.
468.228	And this building
469.656	fundamentally changes
469.656	the world's relationship to architecture.
474.694	Paul Goldberger said that Bilbao
474.694	was one of those rare moments
478.618	when critics, academics,
478.618	and the general public
481.945	were completely united around a building.
485.401	The New York Times
485.401	called this building a miracle.
489.16	Tourism in Bilbao increased 2,500 percent
494.866	after this building was completed.
496.885	So all of a sudden, everybody
496.885	wants one of these buildings:
501.044	L.A.,
503.633	Seattle,
505.196	Chicago,
506.824	New York,
508.552	Cleveland,
510.47	Springfield.
511.737	(Laughter)
512.795	Everybody wants one,
512.795	and Gehry is everywhere.
516.042	He is our very first starchitect.
519.989	Now, how is it possible
519.989	that these forms --
524.889	they're wild and radical --
526.818	how is it possible that they become
526.818	so ubiquitous throughout the world?
531.27	And it happened because media
531.27	so successfully galvanized around them
536.79	that they quickly taught us
536.79	that these forms mean culture and tourism.
543.068	We created an emotional
543.068	reaction to these forms.
546.49	So did every mayor in the world.
548.967	So every mayor knew
548.967	that if they had these forms,
551.493	they had culture and tourism.
555.778	This phenomenon
555.778	at the turn of the new millennium
558.134	happened to a few other starchitects.
560.288	It happened to Zaha
562.695	and it happened to Libeskind,
565.118	and what happened
565.118	to these elite few architects
569.756	at the turn of the new millennium
571.536	could actually start to happen
571.536	to the entire field of architecture,
575.237	as digital media starts
575.237	to increase the speed
578.499	with which we consume information.
581.096	Because think about
581.096	how you consume architecture.
584.429	A thousand years ago,
585.668	you would have had to have walked to
585.668	the village next door to see a building.
589.488	Transportation speeds up:
591.142	You can take a boat, you can take a plane,
591.142	you can be a tourist.
594.166	Technology speeds up:
594.166	You can see it in a newspaper, on TV,
597.087	until finally, we are all
597.087	architectural photographers,
601.974	and the building has become
601.974	disembodied from the site.
606.768	Architecture is everywhere now,
610.339	and that means that
610.339	the speed of communication
613.477	has finally caught up
613.477	to the speed of architecture.
617.409	Because architecture
617.409	actually moves quite quickly.
619.903	It doesn't take long
619.903	to think about a building.
622.635	It takes a long time to build a building,
624.812	three or four years,
627.13	and in the interim, an architect
627.13	will design two or eight
630.822	or a hundred other buildings
633.492	before they know if that building
633.492	that they designed four years ago
637.207	was a success or not.
639.69	That's because there's never been
639.69	a good feedback loop in architecture.
644.416	That's how we end up
644.416	with buildings like this.
647.332	Brutalism wasn't a two-year movement,
650.296	it was a 20-year movement.
652.383	For 20 years, we were producing
652.383	buildings like this
656.225	because we had no idea
656.225	how much you hated it.
660.284	It's never going to happen again,
663.108	I think,
665.262	because we are living on the verge
665.262	of the greatest revolution in architecture
671.386	since the invention of concrete,
673.779	of steel, or of the elevator,
676.257	and it's a media revolution.
679.072	So my theory is that when
679.072	you apply media to this pendulum,
683.756	it starts swinging faster and faster,
686.641	until it's at both extremes
686.641	nearly simultaneously,
690.403	and that effectively blurs the difference
690.403	between innovation and symbol,
695.395	between us, the architects,
695.395	and you, the public.
699.342	Now we can make nearly instantaneous,
699.342	emotionally charged symbols
705.426	out of something that's brand new.
708.453	Let me show you how this plays out
710.21	in a project that my firm
710.21	recently completed.
712.829	We were hired to replace this building,
712.829	which burned down.
716.304	This is the center of a town
716.304	called the Pines
718.797	in Fire Island in New York State.
720.567	It's a vacation community.
722.729	We proposed a building that was audacious,
726.506	that was different than any of the forms
726.506	that the community was used to,
730.181	and we were scared
730.181	and our client was scared
734.726	and the community was scared,
736.513	so we created a series
736.513	of photorealistic renderings
740.693	that we put onto Facebook
742.095	and we put onto Instagram,
744.245	and we let people start
744.245	to do what they do:
746.59	share it, comment, like it, hate it.
750.232	But that meant that two years
750.232	before the building was complete,
754.586	it was already a part of the community,
757.938	so that when the renderings
757.938	looked exactly like the finished product,
764.228	there were no surprises.
766.212	This building was already a part
766.212	of this community,
770.124	and then that first summer,
772.433	when people started arriving
772.433	and sharing the building on social media,
776.375	the building ceased to be just an edifice
776.375	and it became media,
781.886	because these, these are not
781.886	just pictures of a building,
785.693	they're your pictures of a building.
788.527	And as you use them to tell your story,
791.838	they become part
791.838	of your personal narrative,
794.57	and what you're doing
794.57	is you're short-circuiting
798.142	all of our collective memory,
800.416	and you're making these charged symbols
800.416	for us to understand.
805.187	That means we don't need
805.187	the Greeks anymore
807.5	to tell us what to think
807.5	about architecture.
810.142	We can tell each other
810.142	what we think about architecture,
814.191	because digital media hasn't just changed
814.191	the relationship between all of us,
819.986	it's changed the relationship
819.986	between us and buildings.
824.614	Think for a second about
824.614	those librarians back in Livingston.
828.39	If that building was going
828.39	to be built today,
830.829	the first thing they would do is go online
830.829	"and search ""new libraries."""
835.705	They would be bombarded by examples
835.705	of experimentation, of innovation,
840.999	of pushing at the envelope
840.999	of what a library can be.
844.998	That's ammunition.
846.846	That's ammunition
846.846	that they can take with them
849.205	to the mayor of Livingston,
849.205	to the people of Livingston,
852.354	and say, there's no one answer
852.354	to what a library is today.
856.337	Let's be a part of this.
858.287	This abundance of experimentation
861.177	gives them the freedom
861.177	to run their own experiment.
866.452	Everything is different now.
868.664	Architects are no longer
868.664	these mysterious creatures
872.043	that use big words
872.043	and complicated drawings,
874.562	and you aren't the hapless public,
877.546	the consumer that won't accept
877.546	anything that they haven't seen anymore.
882.98	Architects can hear you,
884.737	and you're not intimidated
884.737	by architecture.
887.77	That means that that pendulum
887.77	swinging back and forth
891.176	from style to style,
891.176	from movement to movement,
894.178	is irrelevant.
895.68	We can actually move forward
898.304	and find relevant solutions
898.304	to the problems that our society faces.
903.757	This is the end of architectural history,
907.223	and it means that
907.223	the buildings of tomorrow
910.115	are going to look a lot different
910.115	than the buildings of today.
914.389	It means that a public space
914.389	in the ancient city of Seville
918.821	can be unique and tailored
918.821	to the way that a modern city works.
923.992	It means that a stadium in Brooklyn
923.992	can be a stadium in Brooklyn,
928.435	not some red-brick historical pastiche
931.221	of what we think a stadium ought to be.
934.54	It means that robots are going
934.54	to build our buildings,
937.397	because we're finally ready for the forms
937.397	that they're going to produce.
941.842	And it means that buildings
941.842	will twist to the whims of nature
945.717	instead of the other way around.
948.676	It means that a parking garage
948.676	in Miami Beach, Florida,
952.304	can also be a place for sports
954.812	and for yoga
956.215	and you can even
956.215	get married there late at night.
958.818	(Laughter)
959.866	It means that three architects
959.866	can dream about swimming
964.053	in the East River of New York,
965.997	and then raise nearly
965.997	half a million dollars
968.511	from a community
968.511	that gathered around their cause,
971.863	no one client anymore.
974.765	It means that no building
974.765	is too small for innovation,
977.69	like this little reindeer pavilion
979.912	that's as muscly and sinewy
979.912	as the animals it's designed to observe.
985.808	And it means that a building
985.808	doesn't have to be beautiful
988.57	to be lovable,
989.887	like this ugly little building in Spain,
992.926	where the architects dug a hole,
995.431	packed it with hay,
996.837	and then poured concrete around it,
999.194	and when the concrete dried,
1000.858	they invited someone to come
1000.858	and clean that hay out
1004.442	so that all that's left when it's done
1007.397	is this hideous little room
1010.096	that's filled with the imprints
1010.096	and scratches of how that place was made,
1016.074	and that becomes the most sublime place
1016.074	to watch a Spanish sunset.
1021.658	Because it doesn't matter
1021.658	if a cow builds our buildings
1025.037	or a robot builds our buildings.
1026.871	It doesn't matter how we build,
1026.871	it matters what we build.
1030.899	Architects already know how
1030.899	to make buildings that are greener
1034.348	and smarter and friendlier.
1036.53	We've just been waiting
1036.53	for all of you to want them.
1040.022	And finally, we're not
1040.022	on opposite sides anymore.
1043.957	Find an architect, hire an architect,
1046.953	work with us to design better buildings,
1046.953	better cities, and a better world,
1052.794	because the stakes are high.
1055.635	Buildings don't just reflect our society,
1055.635	they shape our society
1060.849	down to the smallest spaces:
1062.925	the local libraries,
1064.953	the homes where we raise our children,
1067.406	and the walk that they take
1067.406	from the bedroom to the bathroom.
1071.288	Thank you.
1072.412	(Applause)
