25	Images like this, from the Auschwitz concentration camp,
29	have been seared into our consciousness during the twentieth century
34	and have given us a new understanding of who we are,
39	where we've come from and the times we live in.
42	During the twentieth century, we witnessed the atrocities
46	of Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, Rwanda and other genocides,
51	and even though the twenty-first century is only seven years old,
55	we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in Darfur
59	and the daily horrors of Iraq.
62	This has led to a common understanding of our situation,
65	namely that modernity has brought us terrible violence, and perhaps
69	that native peoples lived in a state of harmony that we have departed from, to our peril.
72	Here is an example
77	from an op-ed on Thanksgiving, in the Boston Globe
80	"a couple of years ago, where the writer wrote, ""The Indian life"
84	was a difficult one, but there were no employment problems,
87	community harmony was strong, substance abuse unknown,
90	crime nearly non-existent, what warfare there was between tribes
94	was largely ritualistic and seldom resulted in indiscriminate
97	"or wholesale slaughter."" Now, you're all familiar with this treacle."
102	We teach it to our children. We hear it on television
105	and in storybooks. Now, the original title of this session
110	"was, ""Everything You Know Is Wrong,"" and I'm going to present evidence"
113	that this particular part of our common understanding is wrong,
116	that, in fact, our ancestors were far more violent than we are,
120	that violence has been in decline for long stretches of time,
124	and that today we are probably living in the most peaceful time in our species' existence.
127	Now, in the decade of Darfur and Iraq,
132	a statement like that might seem somewhere between hallucinatory
135	and obscene. But I'm going to try to convince you
138	that that is the correct picture. The decline of violence
144	is a fractal phenomenon. You can see it over millennia,
147	over centuries, over decades and over years,
151	although there seems to have been a tipping point at the onset
153	of the Age of Reason in the sixteenth century. One sees it
157	all over the world, although not homogeneously.
161	It's especially evident in the West, beginning with England
164	and Holland around the time of the Enlightenment.
167	Let me take you on a journey of several powers of 10 --
171	from the millennium scale to the year scale --
173	to try to persuade you of this. Until 10,000 years ago, all humans
177	lived as hunter-gatherers, without permanent settlements
180	or government. And this is the state that's commonly thought
183	to be one of primordial harmony. But the archaeologist
189	Lawrence Keeley, looking at casualty rates
193	among contemporary hunter-gatherers, which is our best source
197	of evidence about this way of life, has shown a rather different conclusion.
203	Here is a graph that he put together
205	showing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare
208	in a number of foraging, or hunting and gathering societies.
213	The red bars correspond to the likelihood that a man will die
219	at the hands of another man, as opposed to passing away
222	of natural causes, in a variety of foraging societies
226	in the New Guinea Highlands and the Amazon Rainforest.
230	And they range from a rate of almost a 60 percent chance that a man will die
233	at the hands of another man to, in the case of the Gebusi,
237	only a 15 percent chance. The tiny, little blue bar in the lower
241	left-hand corner plots the corresponding statistic from United States
245	and Europe in the twentieth century, and includes all the deaths
249	of both World Wars. If the death rate in tribal warfare had prevailed
254	during the 20th century, there would have been two billion deaths rather than 100 million.
260	Also at the millennium scale, we can look
263	at the way of life of early civilizations such as the ones described
268	in the Bible. And in this supposed source of our moral values,
273	one can read descriptions of what was expected in warfare,
277	"such as the following from Numbers 31: ""And they warred"
280	against the Midianites as the Lord commanded Moses,
283	and they slew all the males. And Moses said unto them,
286	'Have you saved all the women alive? Now, therefore, kill every male
290	among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man
293	by lying with him, but all the women children that have not know a man
297	"by lying with him keep alive for yourselves.'"" In other words,"
300	kill the men; kill the children; if you see any virgins,
305	then you can keep them alive so that you can rape them.
308	You can find four or five passages in the Bible of this ilk.
312	Also in the Bible, one sees that the death penalty
315	was the accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality,
320	adultery, blasphemy, idolatry, talking back to your parents --
324	(Laughter) -- and picking up sticks on the Sabbath.
328	Well, let's click the zoom lens
331	down one order of magnitude, and look at the century scale.
334	Although we don't have statistics for warfare throughout
339	the Middle Ages to modern times,
340	we know just from conventional history -- the evidence
343	was under our nose all along that there has been a reduction
347	in socially sanctioned forms of violence.
350	For example, any social history will reveal that mutilation and torture
354	were routine forms of criminal punishment. The kind of infraction
357	today that would give you a fine, in those days would result in
361	your tongue being cut out, your ears being cut off, you being blinded,
365	a hand being chopped off and so on.
367	There were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment:
372	burning at the stake, disemboweling, breaking on the wheel,
375	being pulled apart by horses and so on.
378	The death penalty was a sanction for a long list of non-violent crimes:
382	criticizing the king, stealing a loaf of bread. Slavery, of course,
387	was the preferred labor-saving device, and cruelty was
391	a popular form of entertainment. Perhaps the most vivid example
394	was the practice of cat burning, in which a cat was hoisted
397	on a stage and lowered in a sling into a fire,
400	and the spectators shrieked in laughter as the cat, howling in pain,
406	was burned to death.
408	What about one-on-one murder? Well, there, there are good statistics,
411	because many municipalities recorded the cause of death.
417	The criminologist Manuel Eisner
422	scoured all of the historical records across Europe
424	for homicide rates in any village, hamlet, town, county
429	that he could find, and he supplemented them
431	with national data, when nations started keeping statistics.
435	He plotted on a logarithmic scale, going from 100 deaths
442	per 100,000 people per year, which was approximately the rate
448	of homicide in the Middle Ages. And the figure plummets down
453	to less than one homicide per 100,000 people per year
458	in seven or eight European countries. Then, there is a slight uptick
462	in the 1960s. The people who said that rock 'n' roll would lead
466	to the decline of moral values actually had a grain of truth to that.
470	But there was a decline from at least two orders of magnitude
474	in homicide from the Middle Ages to the present,
477	and the elbow occurred in the early sixteenth century.
482	Let's click down now to the decade scale.
484	According to non-governmental organizations
487	that keep such statistics, since 1945, in Europe and the Americas,
491	there has been a steep decline in interstate wars,
495	in deadly ethnic riots or pogroms, and in military coups,
499	even in South America. Worldwide, there's been a steep decline
503	in deaths in interstate wars. The yellow bars here show the number
509	of deaths per war per year from 1950 to the present.
514	And, as you can see, the death rate goes down from 65,000 deaths
518	per conflict per year in the 1950s to less than 2,000 deaths
522	per conflict per year in this decade, as horrific as it is.
526	Even in the year scale, one can see a decline of violence.
530	Since the end of the Cold War, there have been fewer civil wars,
533	fewer genocides -- indeed, a 90 percent reduction since post-World War II highs --
539	and even a reversal of the 1960s uptick in homicide and violent crime.
545	This is from the FBI Uniform Crime Statistics. You can see
549	that there is a fairly low rate of violence in the '50s and the '60s,
553	then it soared upward for several decades, and began
557	a precipitous decline, starting in the 1990s, so that it went back
561	to the level that was last enjoyed in 1960.
565	President Clinton, if you're here, thank you.
567	(Laughter)
569	So the question is, why are so many people so wrong
572	about something so important? I think there are a number of reasons.
576	One of them is we have better reporting. The Associated Press
579	is a better chronicler of wars over the surface of the Earth
583	than sixteenth-century monks were.
587	There's a cognitive illusion. We cognitive psychologists know that the easier it is
592	to recall specific instances of something,
595	the higher the probability that you assign to it.
598	Things that we read about in the paper with gory footage
602	burn into memory more than reports of a lot more people dying
606	in their beds of old age. There are dynamics in the opinion
612	and advocacy markets: no one ever attracted observers, advocates
617	and donors by saying
619	things just seem to be getting better and better.
621	(Laughter)
622	There's guilt about our treatment of native peoples
625	in modern intellectual life, and an unwillingness to acknowledge
628	there could be anything good about Western culture.
631	And of course, our change in standards can outpace the change
636	in behavior. One of the reasons violence went down
639	is that people got sick of the carnage and cruelty in their time.
642	That's a process that seems to be continuing,
645	but if it outstrips behavior by the standards of the day,
649	things always look more barbaric than they would have been
652	by historic standards. So today, we get exercised -- and rightly so --
656	if a handful of murderers get executed by lethal injection
662	in Texas after a 15-year appeal process. We don't consider
667	that a couple of hundred years ago, they may have been burned
670	at the stake for criticizing the king after a trial
673	that lasted 10 minutes, and indeed, that that would have been repeated
676	over and over again. Today, we look at capital punishment
681	as evidence of how low our behavior can sink,
684	rather than how high our standards have risen.
688	Well, why has violence declined? No one really knows,
691	but I have read four explanations, all of which, I think,
696	have some grain of plausibility. The first is, maybe
699	Thomas Hobbes got it right. He was the one who said
702	"that life in a state of nature was ""solitary, poor, nasty, brutish"
707	"and short."" Not because, he argued,"
711	humans have some primordial thirst for blood
714	or aggressive instinct or territorial imperative,
718	but because of the logic of anarchy. In a state of anarchy,
721	there's a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively,
725	before they invade you. More recently, Thomas Schelling
728	gives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustling
731	in the basement. Being a good American, he has a pistol
733	in the nightstand, pulls out his gun, and walks down the stairs.
737	And what does he see but a burglar with a gun in his hand.
740	Now, each one of them is thinking,
741	"""I don't really want to kill that guy, but he's about to kill me."
745	Maybe I had better shoot him, before he shoots me,
749	especially since, even if he doesn't want to kill me,
751	he's probably worrying right now that I might kill him
754	"before he kills me."" And so on."
757	Hunter-gatherer peoples explicitly go through this train of thought,
762	and will often raid their neighbors out of fear of being raided first.
767	Now, one way of dealing with this problem is by deterrence.
770	You don't strike first, but you have a publicly announced policy
775	that you will retaliate savagely if you are invaded.
778	The only thing is that it's
780	liable to having its bluff called, and therefore can only work
785	if it's credible. To make it credible, you must avenge all insults
790	and settle all scores, which leads to the cycles of bloody vendetta.
794	"Life becomes an episode of ""The Sopranos."" Hobbes' solution,"
799	"the ""Leviathan,"" was that if authority for the legitimate use"
803	of violence was vested in a single democratic agency -- a leviathan --
809	then such a state can reduce the temptation of attack,
812	because any kind of aggression will be punished,
815	leaving its profitability as zero. That would remove the temptation
820	to invade preemptively, out of fear of them attacking you first.
824	It removes the need for a hair trigger for retaliation
828	to make your deterrent threat credible. And therefore, it would lead
831	to a state of peace. Eisner -- the man who plotted the homicide rates
837	that you failed to see in the earlier slide --
840	argued that the timing of the decline of homicide in Europe
844	coincided with the rise of centralized states.
848	So that's a bit of a support for the leviathan theory.
851	Also supporting it is the fact that we today see eruptions of violence
855	in zones of anarchy, in failed states, collapsed empires,
859	frontier regions, mafias, street gangs and so on.
865	The second explanation is that in many times and places,
868	there is a widespread sentiment that life is cheap.
872	In earlier times, when suffering and early death were common
876	in one's own life, one has fewer compunctions about inflicting them
880	on others. And as technology and economic efficiency make life
884	longer and more pleasant, one puts a higher value on life in general.
888	This was an argument from the political scientist James Payne.
892	A third explanation invokes the concept of a nonzero-sum game,
896	"and was worked out in the book ""Nonzero"" by the journalist"
900	Robert Wright. Wright points out that in certain circumstances,
904	cooperation or non-violence can benefit both parties
907	in an interaction, such as gains in trade when two parties trade
913	their surpluses and both come out ahead, or when two parties
917	lay down their arms and split the so-called peace dividend
920	that results in them not having to fight the whole time.
924	Wright argues that technology has increased the number
926	of positive-sum games that humans tend to be embroiled in,
931	by allowing the trade of goods, services and ideas
934	over longer distances and among larger groups of people.
938	The result is that other people become more valuable alive than dead,
941	and violence declines for selfish reasons. As Wright put it,
947	"""Among the many reasons that I think that we should not bomb"
949	"the Japanese is that they built my mini-van."""
952	(Laughter)
954	The fourth explanation is captured in the title of a book
958	"called ""The Expanding Circle,"" by the philosopher Peter Singer,"
962	who argues that evolution bequeathed humans with a sense
965	of empathy, an ability to treat other peoples' interests
970	as comparable to one's own. Unfortunately, by default
974	we apply it only to a very narrow circle of friends and family.
978	People outside that circle are treated as sub-human,
981	and can be exploited with impunity. But, over history,
985	the circle has expanded. One can see, in historical record,
989	it expanding from the village, to the clan, to the tribe,
993	to the nation, to other races, to both sexes,
996	and, in Singer's own arguments, something that we should extend
998	to other sentient species. The question is,
1003	if this has happened, what has powered that expansion?
1006	And there are a number of possibilities, such as increasing circles
1009	of reciprocity in the sense that Robert Wright argues for.
1014	The logic of the golden rule -- the more you think about and interact
1018	with other people, the more you realize that it is untenable
1022	to privilege your interests over theirs,
1026	at least not if you want them to listen to you. You can't say
1029	that my interests are special compared to yours,
1032	anymore than you can say that the particular spot
1035	that I'm standing on is a unique part of the universe
1038	because I happen to be standing on it that very minute.
1041	It may also be powered by cosmopolitanism, by histories,
1045	and journalism, and memoirs, and realistic fiction, and travel,
1049	and literacy, which allows you to project yourself into the lives
1053	of other people that formerly you may have treated as sub-human,
1057	and also to realize the accidental contingency of your own station
1061	"in life, the sense that ""there but for fortune go I."""
1066	Whatever its causes, the decline of violence, I think,
1069	has profound implications. It should force us to ask not just, why
1073	is there war? But also, why is there peace? Not just,
1078	what are we doing wrong? But also, what have we been doing right?
1082	Because we have been doing something right,
1084	and it sure would be good to find out what it is.
1086	Thank you very much.
1087	(Applause).
1098	Chris Anderson: I loved that talk. I think a lot of people here in the room would say
1102	that that expansion of -- that you were talking about,
1105	that Peter Singer talks about, is also driven by, just by technology,
1108	by greater visibility of the other, and the sense that the world
1112	is therefore getting smaller. I mean, is that also a grain of truth?
1116	Steven Pinker: Very much. It would fit both in Wright's theory,
1120	that it allows us to enjoy the benefits of cooperation
1124	over larger and larger circles. But also, I think it helps us
1129	imagine what it's like to be someone else. I think when you read
1132	these horrific tortures that were common in the Middle Ages, you think,
1135	how could they possibly have done it,
1137	how could they have not have empathized with the person
1140	that they're disemboweling? But clearly,
1143	as far as they're concerned, this is just an alien being
1146	that does not have feelings akin to their own. Anything, I think,
1149	that makes it easier to imagine trading places
1152	with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration
1155	to that other person.
1156	CA: Well, Steve, I would love every news media owner to hear that talk
1160	at some point in the next year. I think it's really important. Thank you so much.
1162	SP: My pleasure.
