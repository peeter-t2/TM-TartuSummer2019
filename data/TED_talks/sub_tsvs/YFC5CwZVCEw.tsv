16.267	When I was a child growing up in Maine,
18.426	one of my favorite things to do
20.45	was to look for sand dollars
20.45	on the seashores of Maine,
23.498	because my parents told me
23.498	it would bring me luck.
26.228	But you know, these shells,
26.228	they're hard to find.
28.93	They're covered in sand,
28.93	they're difficult to see.
31.989	However, over time,
31.989	I got used to looking for them.
35.457	I started seeing shapes
37.084	and patterns that helped me
37.084	to collect them.
41.115	This grew into a passion
41.115	for finding things,
44.44	a love for the past and archaeology.
46.805	And eventually, when I started
46.805	studying Egyptology,
50.138	I realized that seeing
50.138	with my naked eyes alone wasn't enough.
54.551	Because all of the sudden, in Egypt,
57.424	my beach had grown
57.424	from a tiny beach in Maine
61.043	to one eight hundred miles long,
63.154	next to the Nile.
64.729	And my sand dollars had grown
64.729	to the size of cities.
69.514	This is really what brought me
69.514	to using satellite imagery.
72.657	For trying to map the past,
72.657	I knew that I had to see differently.
77.14	So I want to show you an example
77.14	of how we see differently
80.522	using the infrared.
82.163	This is a site located
82.163	in the eastern Egyptian delta
85.14	called Mendes.
86.361	And the site visibly appears brown,
89.361	but when we use the infrared
91.591	and we process it, all of the sudden,
94.265	using false color,
95.805	the site appears as bright pink.
97.924	What you are seeing
99.36	are the actual chemical changes
99.36	to the landscape
102.685	caused by the building
102.685	materials and activities
106.201	of the ancient Egyptians.
108.645	What I want to share with you today
110.78	is how we've used satellite data
113.605	to find an ancient Egyptian city,
116.084	called Itjtawy,
117.726	missing for thousands of years.
119.965	Itjtawy was ancient Egypt's capital
123.06	for over four hundred years,
124.607	at a period of time
124.607	called the Middle Kingdom,
126.949	about four thousand years ago.
128.884	The site is located
128.884	in the Faiyum of Egypt,
131.813	and the site is really important,
133.436	because in the Middle Kingdom
133.436	there was this great renaissance
136.458	for ancient Egyptian art,
136.458	architecture and religion.
140.044	Egyptologists have always known
140.044	the site of Itjtawy
142.821	was located somewhere near the pyramids
142.821	of the two kings who built it,
147.275	indicated within the red circles here,
149.813	but somewhere within
149.813	this massive flood plain.
152.131	This area is huge --
153.439	it's four miles by three miles in size.
156.559	The Nile used to flow
156.559	right next to the city of Itjtawy,
159.432	and as it shifted and changed
159.432	and moved over time to the east,
162.869	it covered over the city.
164.726	So, how do you find a buried city
168.591	in a vast landscape?
170.733	Finding it randomly
170.733	would be the equivalent
173.218	of locating a needle in a haystack,
174.94	blindfolded, wearing baseball mitts.
176.814	(Laughter)
178.066	So what we did is
178.066	we used NASA topography data
181.352	to map out the landscape,
181.352	very subtle changes.
184.478	We started to be able to see
184.478	where the Nile used to flow.
188.193	But you can see in more detail,
188.193	and even more interesting,
191.002	this very slight raised area
193.073	seen within the circle up here
194.534	which we thought could possibly be
194.534	the location of the city of Itjtawy.
198.493	So we collaborated
198.493	with Egyptian scientists
201.532	to do coring work, which you see here.
203.682	When I say coring, it's like ice coring,
205.874	but instead of layers of climate change,
207.833	you're looking for layers
207.833	of human occupation.
210.189	And, five meters down,
211.95	underneath a thick layer of mud,
214.101	we found a dense layer of pottery.
217.553	What this shows is that
217.553	at this possible location of Itjtawy,
220.451	five meters down,
221.712	we have a layer of occupation
221.712	for several hundred years,
224.561	dating to the Middle Kingdom,
225.982	dating to the exact period of time
225.982	we think Itjtawy is.
229.386	We also found work stone --
231.998	carnelian, quartz and agate
234.156	that shows that there was
234.156	a jeweler's workshop here.
236.617	These might not look like much,
238.126	but when you think
238.126	about the most common stones
240.799	used in jewelry from the Middle Kingdom,
244.193	these are the stones that were used.
246.002	So, we have a dense layer of occupation
248.21	dating to the Middle Kingdom at this site.
250.235	We also have evidence
250.235	of an elite jeweler's workshop,
253.06	showing that whatever was there
253.06	was a very important city.
256.814	No Itjtawy was here yet,
258.758	but we're going to be
258.758	returning to the site
260.783	in the near future to map it out.
262.861	And even more importantly,
264.536	we have funding to train young Egyptians
264.536	in the use of satellite technology
269.083	so they can be the ones
269.083	making great discoveries as well.
272.784	So I wanted to end with my favorite quote
272.784	from the Middle Kingdom --
277.646	it was probably written
277.646	at the city of Itjtawy
280.211	four thousand years ago.
282.679	"""Sharing knowledge"
282.679	is the greatest of all callings.
285.178	"There's nothing like it in the land."""
286.965	So as it turns out,
286.965	TED was not founded in 1984 AD.
292.473	(Laughter)
295.369	Making ideas actually started in 1984 BC
301.147	at a not-lost-for-long city,
301.147	found from above.
304.425	It certainly puts finding seashells
304.425	by the seashore in perspective.
308.283	Thank you very much.
309.459	(Applause)
311.913	Thank you.
313.094	(Applause)
