12.468	What I'd like to do today is talk
12.468	about one of my favorite subjects,
16.857	and that is the neuroscience of sleep.
20.542	Now, there is a sound --
23.12	(Alarm clock)
25.15	Ah, it worked!
27.19	A sound that is desperately
27.19	familiar to most of us,
30.792	and of course it's the sound
30.792	of the alarm clock.
33.156	And what that truly ghastly,
33.156	awful sound does
36.347	is stop the single most important
36.347	behavioral experience
41.738	that we have, and that's sleep.
44.695	If you're an average sort of person,
	will be spent asleep,
52.433	which means that if you live to 90,
54.668	then 32 years will have
54.668	been spent entirely asleep.
61.587	Now what that 32 years is telling us
61.587	is that sleep at some level is important.
66.857	And yet, for most of us,
66.857	we don't give sleep a second thought.
69.836	We throw it away.
71.669	We really just don't think about sleep.
74.921	And so what I'd like to do today
74.921	is change your views,
78.54	change your ideas
78.54	and your thoughts about sleep.
81.739	And the journey
81.739	that I want to take you on,
84.13	we need to start by going back in time.
88.706	"""Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber."""
93.266	Any ideas who said that?
96.64	Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.
98.999	Yes, let me give you a few more quotes.
102.621	"""O sleep, O gentle sleep,"
102.621	nature's soft nurse,
106.595	"how have I frighted thee?"""
107.944	Shakespeare again, from --
107.944	I won't say it --
110.541	the Scottish play.
111.939	(Laughter)
114.577	From the same time:
115.831	"""Sleep is the golden chain"
115.831	"that ties health and our bodies together."""
120.06	Extremely prophetic, by Thomas Dekker,
120.06	another Elizabethan dramatist.
124.636	But if we jump forward 400 years,
127.678	the tone about sleep changes somewhat.
131.043	This is from Thomas Edison,
131.043	from the beginning of the 20th century:
134.238	"""Sleep is a criminal waste of time"
134.238	"and a heritage from our cave days."""
137.898	Bang!
139.105	(Laughter)
141.673	And if we also jump into the 1980s,
141.673	some of you may remember
146.789	that Margaret Thatcher
146.789	was reported to have said,
149.163	"""Sleep is for wimps."""
150.628	And of course the infamous --
150.628	what was his name? --
153.523	the infamous Gordon Gekko
153.523	"from ""Wall Street"" said,"
155.985	"""Money never sleeps."""
158.46	What do we do in the 20th
158.46	century about sleep?
161.14	Well, of course, we use
161.14	Thomas Edison's light bulb
164.505	to invade the night,
164.505	and we occupied the dark,
167.351	and in the process of this occupation,
170.136	we've treated sleep as an illness, almost.
172.741	We've treated it as an enemy.
175.677	At most now, I suppose,
175.677	we tolerate the need for sleep,
181.068	and at worst perhaps
181.068	many of us think of sleep
183.259	as an illness that needs
183.259	some sort of a cure.
186.247	And our ignorance about sleep
186.247	is really quite profound.
190.307	Why is it? Why do we abandon
190.307	sleep in our thoughts?
193.668	Well, it's because you don't do anything
193.668	much while you're asleep, it seems.
198.008	You don't eat. You don't drink.
201.513	And you don't have sex.
202.814	Well, most of us anyway.
204.242	And so, therefore it's --
206.07	Sorry.
208.032	It's a complete waste of time, right?
210.292	Wrong.
211.689	Actually, sleep is an incredibly
211.689	important part of our biology,
215.512	and neuroscientists
215.512	are beginning to explain
218.08	why it's so very important.
220.547	So let's move to the brain.
223.383	Now, here we have a brain.
228.14	This is donated by a social scientist,
231.985	and they said they didn't know what
231.985	it was or indeed, how to use it, so --
235.604	(Laughter)
238.582	Sorry.
240.714	So I borrowed it.
242.318	I don't think they noticed. OK.
244.03	(Laughter)
246.618	The point I'm trying to make
246.618	is that when you're asleep,
249.815	this thing doesn't shut down.
251.583	In fact, some areas of the brain
251.583	are actually more active
254.289	during the sleep state
254.289	than during the wake state.
257.439	The other thing that's really
257.439	important about sleep
259.869	is that it doesn't arise from a single
259.869	structure within the brain,
263.019	but is to some extent a network property.
265.2	If we flip the brain on its back --
267.656	I love this little bit
267.656	of spinal cord here --
270.668	this bit here is the hypothalamus,
273.597	and right under there is a whole raft
273.597	of interesting structures,
277.435	not least the biological clock.
279.04	The biological clock tells us
279.04	when it's good to be up,
281.679	when it's good to be asleep,
283.251	and what that structure does is interact
285.203	with a whole raft of other areas
285.203	within the hypothalamus,
288.445	the lateral hypothalamus,
288.445	the ventrolateral preoptic nuclei.
291.289	All of those combine,
292.677	and they send projections
292.677	down to the brain stem here.
295.888	The brain stem then projects forward
298.889	and bathes the cortex,
298.889	this wonderfully wrinkly bit over here,
302.958	with neurotransmitters that keep us awake
305.416	and essentially provide us
305.416	with our consciousness.
308.054	So sleep arises from a whole raft
310.794	of different interactions
310.794	within the brain,
312.897	and essentially,
312.897	sleep is turned on and off
315.09	as a result of a range
315.09	of interactions in here.
318.035	OK. So where have we got to?
319.924	We've said that sleep is complicated
323.474	and it takes 32 years of our life.
328.188	But what I haven't explained
328.188	is what sleep is about.
331.251	So why do we sleep?
333.401	And it won't surprise
333.401	any of you that, of course,
335.719	as scientists, we don't have a consensus.
337.711	There are dozens of different ideas
337.711	about why we sleep,
341.009	and I'm going to outline three of those.
343.517	The first is sort of the restoration idea,
346.24	and it's somewhat intuitive.
348.11	Essentially, all the stuff
348.11	we've burned up during the day,
350.9	we restore, we replace,
350.9	we rebuild during the night.
354.16	And indeed, as an explanation,
354.16	it goes back to Aristotle,
357.636	so that's what -- 2,300 years ago.
359.837	It's gone in and out of fashion.
361.458	It's fashionable at the moment
362.927	because what's been shown
362.927	is that within the brain,
365.344	a whole raft of genes have been shown
365.344	to be turned on only during sleep,
370.01	and those genes are associated
370.01	with restoration and metabolic pathways.
374.333	So there's good evidence
374.333	for the whole restoration hypothesis.
378.436	What about energy conservation?
380.428	Again, perhaps intuitive.
383.764	You essentially sleep to save calories.
386.488	Now, when you do the sums,
386.488	though, it doesn't really pan out.
389.958	If you compare an individual
389.958	who has slept at night,
394.302	or stayed awake
394.302	and hasn't moved very much,
398.033	the energy saving of sleeping
398.033	is about 110 calories a night.
402.601	Now, that's the equivalent
402.601	of a hot dog bun.
405.934	Now, I would say that a hot dog bun
409.518	is kind of a meager return
411.335	for such a complicated
411.335	and demanding behavior as sleep.
414.454	So I'm less convinced
414.454	by the energy conservation idea.
418.397	But the third idea I'm quite attracted to,
420.621	which is brain processing
420.621	and memory consolidation.
424.1	What we know is that,
424.1	if after you've tried to learn a task,
428.002	and you sleep-deprive individuals,
429.836	the ability to learn that task is smashed.
432.401	It's really hugely attenuated.
435.481	So sleep and memory consolidation
435.481	is also very important.
438.545	However, it's not just
438.545	the laying down of memory
441.07	and recalling it.
442.664	What's turned out to be really exciting
445.024	is that our ability to come up
445.024	with novel solutions to complex problems
449.587	is hugely enhanced by a night of sleep.
452.029	In fact, it's been estimated
452.029	to give us a threefold advantage.
455.456	Sleeping at night enhances our creativity.
458.123	And what seems to be going on
458.123	is that, in the brain,
461.003	those neural connections
461.003	that are important,
463.58	those synaptic connections
463.58	that are important,
465.781	are linked and strengthened,
467.312	while those that are less important
467.312	tend to fade away and be less important.
472.218	OK.
473.393	So we've had three explanations
473.393	for why we might sleep,
476.432	and I think the important thing to realize
476.432	is that the details will vary,
480.11	and it's probable we sleep
480.11	for multiple different reasons.
483.235	But sleep is not an indulgence.
486.385	It's not some sort of thing that we can
486.385	take on board rather casually.
491.04	I think that sleep was once
491.04	likened to an upgrade
494.907	from economy to business class,
494.907	you know, the equivalent of.
497.955	It's not even an upgrade
497.955	from economy to first class.
501.748	The critical thing to realize is that
501.748	if you don't sleep,
506.889	you don't fly.
508.26	Essentially, you never get there.
510.233	And what's extraordinary
510.233	about much of our society these days
513.542	is that we are desperately sleep-deprived.
516.615	So let's now look at sleep deprivation.
519.298	Huge sectors of society
519.298	are sleep-deprived,
522.012	and let's look at our sleep-o-meter.
524.764	So in the 1950s, good data
524.764	suggests that most of us
528.125	were getting around eight hours
528.125	of sleep a night.
531.49	Nowadays, we sleep one and a half
531.49	to two hours less every night,
535.368	so we're in the six-and-a-half-hours
535.368	every-night league.
539.686	For teenagers, it's worse, much worse.
542.644	They need nine hours
542.644	for full brain performance,
545.626	and many of them, on a school night,
545.626	are only getting five hours of sleep.
549.293	It's simply not enough.
550.945	If we think about other sectors
550.945	of society -- the aged;
554.013	if you are aged, then your ability
554.013	to sleep in a single block
558.452	is somewhat disrupted,
558.452	and many sleep, again,
561.04	less than five hours a night.
562.792	Shift work.
563.973	Shift work is extraordinary,
565.528	perhaps 20 percent
565.528	of the working population,
568.036	and the body clock does not shift
568.036	to the demands of working at night.
572.03	It's locked onto the same
572.03	light-dark cycle as the rest of us.
575.224	So when the poor old
575.224	shift worker is going home
577.459	to try and sleep during the day,
577.459	desperately tired,
579.96	the body clock is saying,
579.96	"""Wake up. This is the time to be awake."""
583.1	So the quality of sleep
583.1	that you get as a night shift worker
586.18	is usually very poor,
586.18	again in that sort of five-hour region.
589.563	And then, of course, tens of millions
589.563	of people suffer from jet lag.
593.1	So who here has jet lag?
596.389	Well, my goodness gracious.
598.365	Well, thank you very much
598.365	indeed for not falling asleep,
601.195	because that's what your brain is craving.
603.893	One of the things that the brain does
603.893	is indulge in micro-sleeps,
609.231	this involuntary falling asleep,
611	and you have essentially
611	no control over it.
613.237	Now, micro-sleeps can be sort
613.237	of somewhat embarrassing,
616.02	but they can also be deadly.
618.02	It's been estimated
618.02	that 31 percent of drivers
621.699	will fall asleep at the wheel
621.699	at least once in their life,
626.005	and in the US, the statistics
626.005	are pretty good:
	have been associated with tiredness,
633.416	loss of vigilance, and falling asleep --
633.416	a hundred thousand a year.
636.604	It's extraordinary.
637.786	At another level of terror,
639.875	we dip into the tragic
639.875	accidents at Chernobyl
643.477	and indeed the space shuttle Challenger,
645.624	which was so tragically lost.
647.577	And in the investigations
647.577	that followed those disasters,
651.002	poor judgment as a result
651.002	of extended shift work
654.02	and loss of vigilance and tiredness
656.326	was attributed to a big chunk
656.326	of those disasters.
662.408	When you're tired and you lack sleep,
664.511	you have poor memory,
664.511	you have poor creativity,
668.156	you have increased impulsiveness,
670.287	and you have overall poor judgment.
672.914	But my friends,
672.914	it's so much worse than that.
676.025	(Laughter)
678.096	If you are a tired brain,
680.08	the brain is craving things to wake it up.
683.04	So drugs, stimulants.
685.23	Caffeine represents
685.23	the stimulant of choice
688.924	across much of the Western world.
690.528	Much of the day is fueled by caffeine,
692.575	and if you're a really naughty
692.575	tired brain, nicotine.
695.613	Of course, you're fueling the waking state
695.613	with these stimulants,
698.93	and then, of course, it gets
698.93	to 11 o'clock at night,
701.39	and the brain says to itself,
702.802	"""Actually, I need"
702.802	to be asleep fairly shortly.
704.988	What do we do about that
704.988	"when I'm feeling completely wired?"""
707.881	Well, of course,
707.881	you then resort to alcohol.
710.765	Now alcohol, short-term,
710.765	you know, once or twice,
714.02	to use to mildly sedate you,
714.02	can be very useful.
716.795	It can actually ease the sleep transition.
719.675	But what you must be so aware of
719.675	is that alcohol doesn't provide sleep.
724.947	A biological mimic for sleep,
726.438	it sedates you.
727.669	So it actually harms
727.669	some of the neural processing
731.058	that's going on during memory
731.058	consolidation and memory recall.
734.01	So it's a short-term acute measure,
736.198	but for goodness sake,
737.38	don't become addicted to alcohol
739.414	as a way of getting to sleep every night.
742.095	Another connection
742.095	between loss of sleep is weight gain.
745.644	If you sleep around
745.644	about five hours or less every night,
749.263	then you have a 50 percent
749.263	likelihood of being obese.
753.132	What's the connection here?
754.879	Well, sleep loss seems to give rise
754.879	to the release of the hormone ghrelin,
759.267	the hunger hormone.
760.448	Ghrelin is released.
761.624	It gets to the brain.
763.059	"The brain says, ""I need carbohydrates,"""
765.866	and what it does is seek out carbohydrates
765.866	and particularly sugars.
769.493	So there's a link between tiredness
772.208	and the metabolic predisposition
772.208	for weight gain: stress.
775.802	Tired people are massively stressed.
778.89	And one of the things of stress,
778.89	of course, is loss of memory,
782.183	which is what I sort of just then
782.183	had a little lapse of.
787.14	But stress is so much more.
789.145	So, if you're acutely stressed,
789.145	not a great problem,
792.319	but it's sustained stress associated
792.319	with sleep loss that's the problem.
796.118	Sustained stress leads
796.118	to suppressed immunity.
800.219	And so, tired people tend to have
800.219	higher rates of overall infection,
803.806	and there's some very good studies
805.482	showing that shift workers, for example,
805.482	have higher rates of cancer.
808.908	Increased levels of stress
808.908	throw glucose into the circulation.
812.756	Glucose becomes a dominant part
812.756	of the vasculature
816.798	and essentially you become
816.798	glucose intolerant.
819.29	Therefore, diabetes 2.
821.609	Stress increases cardiovascular disease
821.609	as a result of raising blood pressure.
827.515	So there's a whole raft of things
827.515	associated with sleep loss
830.832	that are more than just
830.832	a mildly impaired brain,
834.479	which is where I think most people think
834.479	that sleep loss resides.
837.613	So at this point in the talk,
837.613	this is a nice time to think,
841.02	"""Well, do you think on the whole"
841.02	"I'm getting enough sleep?"""
844.234	So a quick show of hands.
846.012	Who feels that they're getting
846.012	enough sleep here?
849.067	Oh. Well, that's pretty impressive.
851.536	Good. We'll talk more about that later,
851.536	about what are your tips.
854.639	So most of us, of course,
854.639	ask the question,
857.059	"""How do I know whether"
857.059	"I'm getting enough sleep?"""
859.39	Well, it's not rocket science.
860.85	If you need an alarm clock to get
860.85	you out of bed in the morning,
863.936	if you are taking a long time to get up,
865.997	if you need lots of stimulants,
867.552	if you're grumpy, if you're irritable,
869.52	if you're told by your work colleagues
869.52	that you're looking tired and irritable,
873.342	chances are you are sleep-deprived.
875.691	Listen to them. Listen to yourself.
877.824	What do you do?
879.291	Well -- and this is slightly offensive --
881.348	sleep for dummies.
882.529	(Laughter)
884.673	Make your bedroom a haven for sleep.
887.482	The first critical thing is make it
887.482	as dark as you possibly can,
891.01	and also make it slightly cool.
892.875	Very important.
894.051	Actually, reduce your amount
894.051	of light exposure
896.981	at least half an hour
896.981	before you go to bed.
899.354	Light increases levels of alertness
899.354	and will delay sleep.
902.131	What's the last thing that most of us
902.131	do before we go to bed?
905.018	We stand in a massively lit bathroom,
907.411	looking into the mirror
907.411	cleaning our teeth.
909.53	It's the worst thing we can possibly do
909.53	before we go to sleep.
913.109	Turn off those mobile phones.
913.109	Turn off those computers.
915.836	Turn off all of those things
915.836	that are also going to excite the brain.
920.155	Try not to drink caffeine
920.155	too late in the day,
922.843	ideally not after lunch.
925.715	Now, we've set about reducing light
925.715	exposure before you go to bed,
929.04	but light exposure in the morning
930.996	is very good at setting the biological
930.996	clock to the light-dark cycle.
934.311	So seek out morning light.
935.994	Basically, listen to yourself.
938.474	Wind down.
939.65	Do those sorts of things
940.836	that you know are going to ease you off
942.882	into the honey-heavy dew of slumber.
946.195	OK.
947.378	That's some facts. What about some myths?
949.704	Teenagers are lazy.
951.01	No. Poor things.
952.898	They have a biological predisposition
952.898	to go to bed late and get up late,
956.348	so give them a break.
957.661	We need eight hours of sleep a night.
961.392	That's an average.
962.572	Some people need more.
962.572	Some people need less.
964.864	And what you need to do
964.864	is listen to your body.
967.101	Do you need that much or do you need more?
969.466	Simple as that.
970.866	Old people need less sleep.
973.01	Not true.
974.684	The sleep demands of the aged
974.684	do not go down.
977.584	Essentially, sleep fragments
977.584	and becomes less robust,
980.903	but sleep requirements do not go down.
983.674	And the fourth myth
983.674	is early to bed, early to rise
987.603	makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.
990.27	Well, that's wrong
990.27	at so many different levels.
993.05	(Laughter)
995.405	There is no evidence that getting up early
995.405	and going to bed early
999.944	gives you more wealth at all.
1001.388	There's no difference
1001.388	in socioeconomic status.
1004.02	In my experience,
1005.195	the only difference between morning
1005.195	people and evening people
1008.104	is that those people that get up
1008.104	in the morning early
1010.629	are just horribly smug.
1011.945	(Laughter)
1013.24	(Applause)
1016.567	OK.
1017.743	So for the last few minutes,
1019.293	what I want to do is change gears
1021.19	and talk about some really new,
1021.19	breaking areas of neuroscience,
1024.963	which is the association
1024.963	between mental health,
1027.871	mental illness and sleep disruption.
1030.189	We've known for 130 years
1030.189	that in severe mental illness,
1034.313	there is always, always sleep disruption,
1037.621	but it's been largely ignored.
1039.103	In the 1970s, when people started
1039.103	to think about this again,
1041.951	"they said, ""Yes, well, of course you have"
1041.951	sleep disruption in schizophrenia,
1045.781	because they're on antipsychotics.
1047.852	It's the antipsychotics causing
1047.852	"the sleep problems,"""
1050.888	ignoring the fact that
1050.888	for a hundred years previously,
1053.841	sleep disruption had been reported
1053.841	before antipsychotics.
1057.846	So what's going on?
1059.67	Several groups are studying
1062.698	conditions like depression,
1062.698	schizophrenia and bipolar
1066.02	and what's going on
1066.02	in terms of sleep disruption.
1068.77	We have a big study which we published
1068.77	last year on schizophrenia,
1072.508	and the data were quite extraordinary.
1075.981	In those individuals with schizophrenia,
1078.957	much of the time, they were awake
1078.957	during the night phase
1082.874	and then they were asleep during the day.
1085.088	Other groups showed no 24-hour
1085.088	patterns whatsoever --
1087.651	their sleep was absolutely smashed.
1089.62	And some had no ability to regulate
1089.62	their sleep by the light-dark cycle.
1093.808	They were getting up later and later
1093.808	and later and later each night.
1097.074	It was smashed.
1098.371	So what's going on?
1100.582	And the really exciting news
1102.13	is that mental illness and sleep
1102.13	are not simply associated,
1107.733	but they are physically linked
1107.733	within the brain.
1110.471	The neural networks that predispose
1110.471	you to normal sleep,
1113.429	give you normal sleep,
1114.714	and those that give you normal
1114.714	mental health, are overlapping.
1118.344	And what's the evidence for that?
1120.027	Well, genes that have been shown
1122.964	to be very important
1122.964	in the generation of normal sleep,
1125.918	when mutated, when changed,
1127.685	also predispose individuals
1127.685	to mental health problems.
1131.041	And last year, we published a study
1133.026	which showed that a gene
1133.026	that's been linked to schizophrenia,
1136.413	when mutated, also smashes the sleep.
1139.793	So we have evidence
1139.793	of a genuine mechanistic overlap
1143.14	between these two important systems.
1145.806	Other work flowed from these studies.
1147.83	The first was that sleep disruption
1151.03	actually precedes certain types
1151.03	of mental illness,
1154.932	and we've shown that
1154.932	in those young individuals
1157.368	who are at high risk
1157.368	of developing bipolar disorder,
1160.777	they already have a sleep abnormality
1163.294	prior to any clinical
1163.294	diagnosis of bipolar.
1167.463	The other bit of data
1167.463	was that sleep disruption
1173.212	may actually exacerbate, make worse,
1173.212	the mental illness state.
1177.378	My colleague Dan Freeman
1177.378	has used a range of agents
1180.04	which have stabilized sleep
1180.04	and reduced levels of paranoia
1183.608	in those individuals by 50 percent.
1186.189	So what have we got?
1187.808	We've got, in these connections,
1187.808	some really exciting things.
1193.721	In terms of the neuroscience,
1195.147	by understanding these two systems,
1196.917	we're really beginning to understand
1196.917	how both sleep and mental illness
1200.241	are generated and regulated
1200.241	within the brain.
1203.128	The second area
1203.128	is that if we can use sleep
1206.843	and sleep disruption
1206.843	as an early warning signal,
1209.351	then we have the chance of going in.
1211.621	If we know these individuals
1211.621	are vulnerable,
1214.05	early intervention then becomes possible.
1216.593	And the third, which I think
1216.593	is the most exciting,
1219.188	is that we can think
1219.188	of the sleep centers within the brain
1221.99	as a new therapeutic target.
1223.37	Stabilize sleep in those individuals
1223.37	who are vulnerable,
1226.284	we can certainly make them healthier,
1228.295	but also alleviate some of the appalling
1228.295	symptoms of mental illness.
1233.01	So let me just finish.
1234.396	What I started by saying is:
1234.396	Take sleep seriously.
1237.687	Our attitudes toward sleep
1237.687	are so very different
1240.16	from a pre-industrial age,
1241.709	when we were almost wrapped in a duvet.
1243.836	We used to understand intuitively
1243.836	the importance of sleep.
1247.299	And this isn't some sort
1247.299	of crystal-waving nonsense.
1250.878	This is a pragmatic response
1250.878	to good health.
1253.522	If you have good sleep,
1253.522	it increases your concentration,
1256.363	attention, decision-making,
1256.363	creativity, social skills, health.
1260.372	If you get sleep, it reduces
1260.372	your mood changes, your stress,
1264.721	your levels of anger, your impulsivity,
1266.878	and your tendency to drink and take drugs.
1269.495	And we finished by saying
1272.354	that an understanding
1272.354	of the neuroscience of sleep
1275.504	is really informing the way we think
1278.332	about some of the causes
1278.332	of mental illness,
1280.866	and indeed is providing us new ways
1282.946	to treat these incredibly
1282.946	debilitating conditions.
1287.666	Jim Butcher, the fantasy writer, said,
1291.5	"""Sleep is God. Go worship."""
1293.545	And I can only recommend
1293.545	that you do the same.
1295.776	Thank you for your attention.
1297.228	(Applause)
