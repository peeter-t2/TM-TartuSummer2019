12.58	What if our plants
14.58	could sense the toxicity
14.58	levels in the soil
17.3	and express that toxicity
17.3	through the color of its leaves?
21.5	What if those plants could also
21.5	remove those toxins from the soil?
26.38	Instead, what if those plants
28.5	grew their own packaging,
30.38	or were designed to only be harvested
32.98	by their owners' own patented machines?
35.26	What happens when biological design
37.18	is driven by the motivations
37.18	of mass-produced commodities?
40.74	What kind of world would that be?
43.06	My name is Ani, and I'm a designer
43.06	and researcher at MIT Media Lab,
47.1	where I'm part of a relatively new
47.1	and unique group called Design Fiction,
51.26	where we're wedged somewhere
51.26	between science fiction and science fact.
55.38	And at MIT, I am lucky enough
55.38	to rub shoulders with scientists
59.54	studying all kinds of cutting edge fields
61.54	like synthetic neurobiology,
63.94	artificial intelligence, artificial life
65.98	and everything in between.
67.74	And across campus,
67.74	there's truly brilliant scientists
71.58	asking questions like,
71.58	"""How can I make the world a better place?"""
75.1	And part of what my group
75.1	"likes to ask is, ""What is better?"""
78.02	What is better for you, for me,
80.14	for a white woman, a gay man,
82.3	a veteran, a child with a prosthetic?
84.82	Technology is never neutral.
86.9	It frames a reality
88.58	and reflects a context.
90.38	Can you imagine what it would say
90.38	about the work-life balance at your office
94.14	if these were standard issue
94.14	on the first day?
96.34	(Laughter)
97.78	I believe it's the role
97.78	of artists and designers
100.06	to raise critical questions.
102.22	Art is how you can see
102.22	and feel the future,
104.66	and today is an exciting
104.66	time to be a designer,
107.14	for all the new tools becoming accessible.
109.3	For instance, synthetic biology
110.9	seeks to write biology
110.9	as a design problem.
113.82	And through these developments,
115.38	my lab asks, what are the roles
115.38	and responsibilities
118.34	of an artist, designer,
118.34	scientist or businessman?
122.7	What are the implications
124.26	of synthetic biology, genetic engineering,
127.02	and how are they shaping our notions
127.02	of what it means to be a human?
131.66	What are the implications of this
131.66	on society, on evolution
134.98	and what are the stakes in this game?
137.58	My own speculative design research
137.58	at the current moment
140.82	plays with synthetic biology,
142.26	but for more emotionally driven output.
145.3	I'm obsessed with olfaction
145.3	as a design space,
148.1	and this project started with this idea
150.94	of what if you could take
150.94	a smell selfie, a smelfie?
154.74	(Laughter)
156.22	What if you could take
156.22	your own natural body odor
158.98	and send it to a lover?
161.06	Funny enough, I found that this
161.06	was a 19th century Austrian tradition,
164.86	where couples in courtship
164.86	would keep a slice of apple
167.5	crammed under their armpit during dances,
170.1	and at the end of the evening,
171.66	the girl would give the guy
171.66	she most fancied her used fruit,
175.06	and if the feeling was mutual,
177.26	he would wolf down that stinky apple.
179.22	(Laughter)
183.5	Famously, Napoleon wrote
183.5	many love letters to Josephine,
186.82	but perhaps amongst the most memorable
186.82	is this brief and urgent note:
191.1	"""Home in three days. Don't bathe."""
193.34	(Laughter)
195.42	Both Napoleon and Josephine
195.42	adored violets.
199.14	Josephine wore violet-scented perfume,
201.3	carried violets on their wedding day,
203.14	and Napoleon sent her a bouquet of violets
205.179	every year on their anniversary.
206.74	When Josephine passed away,
208.34	he planted violets at her grave,
209.94	and just before his exile,
211.78	he went back to that tomb site,
213.94	picked some of those flowers,
213.94	entombed them in a locket
216.62	and wore them until the day he died.
218.38	And I found this so moving,
219.94	I thought, could I engineer that violet
219.94	to smell just like Josephine?
223.86	What if, for the rest of eternity,
225.54	when you went to visit her site,
227.14	you could smell Josephine
227.14	just as Napoleon loved her?
230.42	Could we engineer new ways of mourning,
232.86	new rituals for remembering?
234.98	After all, we've engineered
234.98	transgenic crops
237.7	to be maximized for profit,
239.86	crops that stand up to transport,
242.02	crops that have a long shelf life,
243.98	crops that taste sugary sweet
243.98	but resist pests,
246.46	sometimes at the expense
246.46	of nutritional value.
249.9	Can we harness these same technologies
249.9	for an emotionally sensitive output?
254.5	So currently in my lab,
255.82	I'm researching questions like,
255.82	what makes a human smell like a human?
259.14	And it turns out it's fairly complicated.
261.78	Factors such as your diet,
261.78	your medications, your lifestyle
265.02	all factor into the way you smell.
267.06	And I found that our sweat
267.06	is mostly odorless,
269.62	but it's our bacteria and microbiome
271.779	that's responsible for your smells,
271.779	your mood, your identity
275.54	and so much beyond.
277.18	And there's all kinds
277.18	of molecules that you emit
279.5	but which we only perceive subconsciously.
282.94	So I've been cataloging and collecting
285.3	bacteria from different sites of my body.
287.5	After talking to a scientist, we thought,
289.5	maybe the perfect concoction of Ani
291.22	is like 10 percent collarbone,
297.54	and occasionally
297.54	I let researchers from other labs
300.62	take a sniff of my samples.
302.3	And it's been interesting to hear
302.3	how smell of the body
305.5	is perceived outside
305.5	of the context of the body.
308.34	I've gotten feedback such as,
309.94	smells like flowers, like chicken,
312.42	like cornflakes,
313.66	like beef carnitas.
315.14	(Laughter)
317.06	At the same time, I cultivate
317.06	a set of carnivorous plants
320.7	for their ability to emit
320.7	fleshlike odors to attract prey,
324.38	in an attempt to kind of create
324.38	this symbiotic relationship
327.22	between my bacteria and this organism.
331.34	And as it so happens,
331.34	I'm at MIT and I'm in a bar,
334.02	and I was talking to a scientist
336.34	who happens to be a chemist
336.34	and a plant scientist,
338.74	and I was telling him about my project,
340.66	"and he was like, ""Well, this sounds"
340.66	"like botany for lonely women."""
343.82	(Laughter)
346.86	"Unperturbed, I said, ""OK."""
349.78	I challenged him.
351.02	"""Can we engineer a plant"
351.02	"that can love me back?"""
354.34	And for some reason,
354.34	"he was like, ""Sure, why not?"""
357.82	So we started with,
357.82	can we get a plant to grow towards me
360.78	like I was the sun?
362.26	And so we're looking at mechanisms
362.26	in plants such as phototropism,
366.22	which causes the plant
366.22	to grow towards the sun
368.42	by producing hormones like auxin,
370.42	which causes cell elongation
370.42	on the shady side.
373.1	And right now I'm creating
373.1	a set of lipsticks
375.26	that are infused with these chemicals
377.1	that allow me to interact with a plant
377.1	on its own chemical signatures --
380.78	lipsticks that cause plants
380.78	to grow where I kiss it,
384.22	plants that blossom
384.22	where I kiss the bloom.
386.98	And through these projects,
389.78	I'm asking questions like,
391.22	how do we define nature?
392.94	How do we define nature
392.94	when we can reengineer its properties,
396.5	and when should we do it?
397.94	Should we do it for profit, for utility?
401.66	Can we do it for emotional ends?
403.38	Can biotechnology be used
403.38	to create work as moving as music?
406.98	What are the thresholds between science
408.9	and its ability to shape
408.9	our emotional landscape?
412.46	It's a famous design mantra
412.46	that form follows function.
416.26	Well, now, wedged somewhere
416.26	between science, design and art
420.34	I get to ask,
421.58	what if fiction informs fact?
423.06	What kind of R&amp;D lab would that look like
425.14	and what kind of questions
425.14	would we ask together?
427.78	We often look to technology as the answer,
430.14	but as an artist and designer,
431.7	I like to ask, but what is the question?
434.22	Thank you.
435.46	(Applause)
