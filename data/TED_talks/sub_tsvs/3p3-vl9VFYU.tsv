15.26	So as a fashion designer,
17.26	I've always tended to think of materials
19.26	something like this,
21.26	or this,
24.26	or maybe this.
27.26	But then I met a biologist,
30.26	and now I think of materials like this --
33.26	green tea, sugar,
35.26	a few microbes and a little time.
38.26	I'm essentially using a kombucha recipe,
40.26	which is a symbiotic mix
42.26	of bacteria, yeasts and other micro-organisms,
45.26	which spin cellulose
47.26	in a fermentation process.
50.26	Over time, these tiny threads
52.26	form in the liquid into layers
54.26	and produce a mat on the surface.
59.26	So we start by brewing the tea.
61.26	I brew up to about 30 liters of tea at a time,
64.26	and then while it's still hot, add a couple of kilos of sugar.
67.26	We stir this in until it's completely dissolved
70.26	and then pour it into a growth bath.
72.26	We need to check that the temperature
74.26	has cooled to below 30 degrees C.
77.26	And then we're ready to add the living organism.
79.26	And along with that, some acetic acid.
81.26	And once you get this process going,
83.26	you can actually recycle
85.26	your previous fermented liquid.
88.26	We need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth.
91.26	And I use a heat mat to sit the bath on
94.26	and a thermostat to regulate it.
96.26	And actually, in hot weather, I can just grow it outside.
99.26	So this is my mini fabric farm.
101.26	After about three days,
103.26	the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid.
106.26	So this is telling us that the fermentation is in full swing.
109.26	And the bacteria are feeding
111.26	on the sugar nutrients in the liquid.
113.26	So they're spinning these tiny nano fibers
115.26	of pure cellulose.
117.26	And they're sticking together, forming layers
119.26	and giving us a sheet on the surface.
121.26	After about two to three weeks,
123.26	we're looking at something which is about an inch in thickness.
126.26	So the bath on the left is after five days,
129.26	and on the right, after 10.
131.26	And this is a static culture.
133.26	You don't have to do anything to it;
135.26	you just literally watch it grow.
137.26	It doesn't need light.
139.26	And when it's ready to harvest, you take it out of the bath
142.26	and you wash it in cold, soapy water.
144.26	At this point, it's really heavy.
146.26	It's over 90 percent water,
148.26	so we need to let that evaporate.
150.26	So I spread it out onto a wooden sheet.
152.26	Again, you can do that outside
154.26	and just let it dry in the air.
156.26	And as it's drying, it's compressing,
158.26	so what you're left with, depending on the recipe,
160.26	is something that's either
162.26	like a really light-weight, transparent paper,
164.26	or something which is much more like a flexible vegetable leather.
168.26	And then you can either cut that out
170.26	and sew it conventionally,
172.26	or you can use the wet material
174.26	to form it around a three-dimensional shape.
177.26	And as it evaporates,
179.26	it will knit itself together, forming seams.
181.26	So the color in this jacket is coming purely from green tea.
184.26	I guess it also looks a little bit like human skin,
186.26	which intrigues me.
189.26	Since it's organic,
191.26	I'm really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals.
194.26	I can make it change color without using dye
197.26	by a process of iron oxidation.
199.26	Using fruit and vegetable staining,
201.26	create organic patterning.
203.26	And using indigo,
205.26	make it anti-microbial.
207.26	And in fact, cotton
209.26	would take up to 18 dips in indigo
212.26	to achieve a color this dark.
214.26	And because of the super-absorbency of this kind of cellulose,
217.26	it just takes one, and a really short one at that.
220.26	What I can't yet do is make it water-resistant.
223.26	So if I was to walk outside in the rain
226.26	wearing this dress today,
228.26	I would immediately start to absorb
230.26	huge amounts of water.
233.26	The dress would get really heavy,
235.26	and eventually the seams would probably fall apart --
237.26	leaving me feeling rather naked.
239.26	Possibly a good performance piece,
241.26	but definitely not ideal for everyday wear.
245.26	What I'm looking for
247.26	is a way to give the material
249.26	the qualities that I need.
251.26	So what I want to do is say to a future bug,
254.26	"""Spin me a thread."
256.26	Align it in this direction.
258.26	Make it hydrophobic.
260.26	And while you're at it,
262.26	"just form it around this 3D shape."""
265.26	Bacterial cellulose is actually already being used for wound healing,
269.26	and possibly in the future
271.26	for biocompatible blood vessels,
274.26	possibly even replacement bone tissue.
276.26	But with synthetic biology,
278.26	we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium
282.26	to produce something
284.26	that gives us the quality,
286.26	quantity and shape
288.26	of material that we desire.
290.26	Obviously, as a designer, that's really exciting
293.26	because then I start to think, wow,
295.26	we could actually imagine
297.26	growing consumable products.
301.26	What excites me about using microbes
304.26	is their efficiency.
306.26	So we only grow what we need.
308.26	There's no waste.
310.26	And in fact, we could make it from a waste stream --
313.26	so for example,
315.26	a waste sugar stream
317.26	from a food processing plant.
319.26	Finally, at the end of use, we could biodegrade it naturally
322.26	along with your vegetable peelings.
325.26	What I'm not suggesting is that microbial cellulose
328.26	is going to be a replacement
330.26	for cotton, leather or other textile materials.
333.26	But I do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition
337.26	to our increasingly precious natural resources.
340.26	Ultimately, maybe it won't even be fashion
342.26	where we see these microbes have their impact.
344.26	We could, for example, imagine
346.26	growing a lamp, a chair,
349.26	a car or maybe even a house.
352.26	So I guess what my question to you is:
355.26	in the future, what would you choose to grow?
357.26	Thank you very much.
359.26	(Applause)
368.26	Bruno Giussani: Suzanne, just a curiosity,
370.26	what you're wearing is not random. (Suzanne Lee: No.)
373.26	This is one of the jackets you grew?
375.26	SL: Yes, it is.
377.26	It's probably -- part of the project's still in process
379.26	because this one
381.26	is actually biodegrading in front of your eyes.
383.26	(Laughter)
385.26	It's absorbing my sweat, and it's feeding on it.
388.26	BG: Okay, so we'll let you go and save it, and rescue it.
390.26	Suzanne Lee. (SL: Thank you.)
393.26	(Applause)
