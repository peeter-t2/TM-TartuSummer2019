12.817	Think of a hard choice
12.817	you'll face in the near future.
16.391	It might be between two careers --
18.236	artist and accountant --
20.286	or places to live --
20.286	the city or the country --
23.123	or even between two people to marry --
25.021	you could marry Betty
25.021	or you could marry Lolita.
28.572	Or it might be a choice
28.572	about whether to have children,
31.589	to have an ailing parent move in with you,
33.96	to raise your child in a religion
33.96	that your partner lives by
37.201	but leaves you cold.
39.236	Or whether to donate
39.236	your life savings to charity.
42.622	Chances are, the hard choice
42.622	you thought of was something big,
45.56	something momentous,
45.56	something that matters to you.
48.763	Hard choices seem to be occasions
51.053	for agonizing, hand-wringing,
51.053	the gnashing of teeth.
56.073	But I think we've
56.073	misunderstood hard choices
58.162	and the role they play in our lives.
60.253	Understanding hard choices
62.155	uncovers a hidden power
62.155	each of us possesses.
66.972	What makes a choice hard
66.972	is the way the alternatives relate.
70.909	In any easy choice,
72.383	one alternative is better than the other.
74.91	In a hard choice,
76.403	one alternative is better in some ways,
78.955	the other alternative
78.955	is better in other ways,
81.18	and neither is better
81.18	than the other overall.
84.732	You agonize over whether to stay
84.732	in your current job in the city
89.003	or uproot your life
89.003	for more challenging work in the country,
93.479	because staying is better in some ways,
95.705	moving is better in others,
97.329	and neither is better
97.329	than the other overall.
101.368	We shouldn't think
101.368	that all hard choices are big.
105.023	Let's say you're deciding
105.023	what to have for breakfast.
107.654	You could have high fiber bran cereal
110.534	or a chocolate donut.
112.199	Suppose what matters in the choice
112.199	is tastiness and healthfulness.
116.563	The cereal is better for you,
118.829	the donut tastes way better,
121.01	but neither is better
121.01	than the other overall,
123.236	a hard choice.
125.348	Realizing that small choices
125.348	can also be hard,
129.372	may make big hard choices
129.372	seem less intractable.
133.563	After all, we manage to figure out
133.563	what to have for breakfast,
136.493	so maybe we can figure out
136.493	whether to stay in the city
139.648	or uproot for the new job in the country.
143.789	We also shouldn't think
143.789	that hard choices are hard
148.365	because we are stupid.
150.692	When I graduated from college,
152.632	I couldn't decide between two careers,
152.632	philosophy and law.
156.158	I really loved philosophy.
159.6	There are amazing things
159.6	you can learn as a philosopher,
162.576	and all from the comfort of an armchair.
166.106	But I came from a modest immigrant family
169.008	where my idea of luxury
170.481	was having a pork tongue
170.481	and jelly sandwich
172.99	in my school lunchbox,
175.232	so the thought of spending my whole life
177.621	sitting around in armchairs
177.621	just thinking ...
181.335	Well, that struck me as the height
181.335	of extravagance and frivolity.
185.357	So I got out my yellow pad,
187.127	I drew a line down the middle,
189.034	and I tried my best
189.034	to think of the reasons
191.455	for and against each alternative.
195.199	I remember thinking to myself,
197.413	if only I knew what my life
197.413	in each career would be like.
202.428	If only God or Netflix would send me a DVD
202.428	of my two possible future careers,
208.439	I'd be set.
209.635	I'd compare them side by side,
211.561	I'd see that one was better,
213.492	and the choice would be easy.
215.867	But I got no DVD,
217.976	and because I couldn't
217.976	figure out which was better,
220.843	I did what many of us do in hard choices:
223.58	I took the safest option.
226.466	Fear of being an unemployed philosopher
226.466	led me to become a lawyer,
232.256	and as I discovered,
232.256	lawyering didn't quite fit.
235.61	It wasn't who I was.
237.889	So now I'm a philosopher,
239.527	and I study hard choices,
241.489	and I can tell you,
241.489	that fear of the unknown,
244.838	while a common motivational default
244.838	in dealing with hard choices,
249.958	rests on a misconception of them.
252.505	It's a mistake to think
252.505	that in hard choices,
255.459	one alternative
255.459	really is better than the other,
258.477	but we're too stupid to know which,
260.46	and since we don't know which,
261.927	we might as well take
261.927	the least risky option.
264.825	Even taking two alternatives side by side
267.207	with full information,
267.207	a choice can still be hard.
272.099	Hard choices are hard
272.099	not because of us or our ignorance;
276.179	they're hard because there
276.179	is no best option.
281.231	Now, if there's no best option,
283.179	if the scales don't tip in favor
283.179	of one alternative over another,
288.06	then surely the alternatives
288.06	must be equally good.
291.797	So maybe the right thing
291.797	to say in hard choices
294.092	is that they're
294.092	between equally good options.
296.77	But that can't be right.
297.955	If alternatives are equally good,
297.955	you should just flip a coin between them,
301.898	and it seems a mistake to think,
304.333	here's how you should
304.333	decide between careers,
306.907	places to live, people to marry:
308.501	Flip a coin.
311.156	There's another reason for thinking
312.891	that hard choices aren't choices
312.891	between equally good options.
318.063	Suppose you have a choice
318.063	between two jobs:
321.744	you could be an investment banker
324.708	or a graphic artist.
327.22	There are a variety of things
327.22	that matter in such a choice,
330.036	like the excitement of the work,
332.615	achieving financial security,
334.376	having time to raise a family, and so on.
336.75	Maybe the artist's career
336.75	puts you on the cutting edge
341.209	of new forms of pictorial expression.
344.049	Maybe the banking career
344.049	puts you on the cutting edge
346.869	of new forms of financial manipulation.
350.012	(Laughter)
351.62	Imagine the two jobs however you like,
354.584	so that neither is better than the other.
357.696	Now suppose we improve one of them, a bit.
360.673	Suppose the bank, wooing you,
363.612	adds 500 dollars a month to your salary.
366.432	Does the extra money
367.806	now make the banking job
367.806	better than the artist one?
372.94	Not necessarily.
375.049	A higher salary makes the banking job
375.049	better than it was before,
379.18	but it might not be enough
380.822	to make being a banker
380.822	better than being an artist.
385.299	But if an improvement in one of the jobs
385.299	doesn't make it better than the other,
389.79	then the two original jobs
389.79	could not have been equally good.
393.812	If you start with two things
393.812	that are equally good,
396.233	and you improve one of them,
397.598	it now must be better than the other.
400.653	That's not the case
400.653	with options in hard choices.
405.393	So now we've got a puzzle.
407.755	We've got two jobs.
409.387	Neither is better than the other,
409.387	nor are they equally good.
413.526	So how are we supposed to choose?
415.955	Something seems to have gone wrong here.
420.303	Maybe the choice itself is problematic,
420.303	and comparison is impossible.
426.184	But that can't be right.
427.748	It's not like we're trying to choose
427.748	between two things that can't be compared.
432.234	We're weighing the merits
432.234	of two jobs, after all,
435.135	not the merits of the number nine
435.135	and a plate of fried eggs.
440.052	A comparison of the overall
440.052	merits of two jobs
443.42	is something we can make,
445.331	and one we often do make.
449.407	I think the puzzle arises
451.487	because of an unreflective assumption
451.487	we make about value.
455.995	We unwittingly assume that values
455.995	like justice, beauty, kindness,
462.006	are akin to scientific quantities,
462.006	like length, mass and weight.
469.247	Take any comparative question
469.247	not involving value,
472.362	such as which of two suitcases is heavier.
475.907	There are only three possibilities.
478.648	The weight of one is greater, lesser
478.648	or equal to the weight of the other.
484.605	Properties like weight can be
484.605	represented by real numbers --
487.803	one, two, three and so on --
489.765	and there are only
489.765	three possible comparisons
492.847	between any two real numbers.
495.24	One number is greater, lesser,
495.24	or equal to the other.
500.475	Not so with values.
503.44	As post-Enlightenment creatures,
505.291	we tend to assume
507.265	that scientific thinking holds the key
507.265	to everything of importance in our world,
513.05	but the world of value
513.05	is different from the world of science.
516.64	The stuff of the one world
516.64	can be quantified by real numbers.
520.252	The stuff of the other world can't.
523.712	We shouldn't assume that the world of is,
523.712	of lengths and weights,
528.008	has the same structure
528.008	as the world of ought,
530.939	of what we should do.
532.904	So if what matters to us --
535.009	a child's delight, the love
535.009	you have for your partner â€”
538.547	can't be represented by real numbers,
541.375	then there's no reason to believe
543.341	that in choice, there are only
543.341	three possibilities --
547.181	that one alternative is better,
547.181	worse or equal to the other.
552.464	We need to introduce
552.464	a new, fourth relation
556.73	beyond being better, worse or equal,
560.369	that describes what's going on
560.369	in hard choices.
563.96	I like to say that
563.96	"the alternatives are ""on a par."""
567.151	When alternatives are on a par,
569.075	it may matter very much which you choose,
572.465	but one alternative
572.465	isn't better than the other.
575.404	Rather, the alternatives are
575.404	in the same neighborhood of value,
579.806	in the same league of value,
581.877	while at the same time
581.877	being very different in kind of value.
586.444	That's why the choice is hard.
589.754	Understanding hard choices in this way
592.187	uncovers something
592.187	about ourselves we didn't know.
596.266	Each of us has the power
596.266	to create reasons.
602.172	Imagine a world
602.172	in which every choice you face
605.51	is an easy choice,
606.907	that is, there's always
606.907	a best alternative.
609.207	If there's a best alternative,
609.207	then that's the one you should choose,
612.614	because part of being rational
614.4	is doing the better thing
614.4	rather than the worse thing,
617.139	choosing what you have
617.139	most reason to choose.
620.567	In such a world,
622.297	we'd have most reason
624.722	to wear black socks instead of pink socks,
627.193	to eat cereal instead of donuts,
629.153	to live in the city
629.153	rather than the country,
631.231	to marry Betty instead of Lolita.
633.126	A world full of only easy choices
633.126	would enslave us to reasons.
639.963	When you think about it,
641.29	(Laughter)
642.504	it's nuts to believe
642.504	that the reasons given to you
648.235	dictated that you had
648.235	most reason to pursue
653.006	the exact hobbies you do,
655.952	to live in the exact house you do,
658.173	to work at the exact job you do.
661.471	Instead, you faced alternatives
661.471	that were on a par --
665.959	hard choices --
667.149	and you made reasons for yourself
670.186	to choose that hobby,
670.186	that house and that job.
675.004	When alternatives are on a par,
677.261	the reasons given to us,
678.813	the ones that determine
678.813	whether we're making a mistake,
681.793	are silent as to what to do.
684.989	It's here, in the space of hard choices,
688.702	that we get to exercise
688.702	our normative power --
693.28	the power to create reasons for yourself,
695.816	to make yourself into the kind of person
700.226	for whom country living
700.226	is preferable to the urban life.
705.337	When we choose between options
705.337	that are on a par,
708.743	we can do something
708.743	really rather remarkable.
712.495	We can put our very selves
712.495	behind an option.
716.325	Here's where I stand.
718.91	Here's who I am, I am for banking.
722.132	I am for chocolate donuts.
724.291	(Laughter)
726.37	This response in hard choices
726.37	is a rational response,
730.721	but it's not dictated
730.721	by reasons given to us.
733.421	Rather, it's supported
733.421	by reasons created by us.
739.765	When we create reasons for ourselves
742.356	to become this kind
742.356	of person rather than that,
745.646	we wholeheartedly become
745.646	the people that we are.
749.62	You might say that we become
749.62	the authors of our own lives.
755.047	So when we face hard choices,
755.047	we shouldn't beat our head against a wall
759.668	trying to figure out
759.668	which alternative is better.
762.045	There is no best alternative.
764.502	Instead of looking for reasons out there,
767.062	we should be looking for reasons in here:
769.823	Who am I to be?
772.278	You might decide to be
772.278	a pink sock-wearing,
775.744	cereal-loving, country-living banker,
779.657	and I might decide to be
779.657	a black sock-wearing,
782.873	urban, donut-loving artist.
786.132	What we do in hard choices
786.132	is very much up to each of us.
792.887	Now, people who don't exercise
792.887	their normative powers in hard choices
797.736	are drifters.
799.513	We all know people like that.
801.125	I drifted into being a lawyer.
803.445	I didn't put my agency behind lawyering.
805.603	I wasn't for lawyering.
808.542	Drifters allow the world
808.542	to write the story of their lives.
813.439	They let mechanisms
813.439	of reward and punishment --
817.291	pats on the head, fear,
817.291	the easiness of an option --
821.23	to determine what they do.
823.936	So the lesson of hard choices:
826.373	reflect on what you can
826.373	put your agency behind,
830.861	on what you can be for,
833.53	and through hard choices,
835.769	become that person.
839.199	Far from being sources of agony and dread,
842.056	hard choices are precious opportunities
845.432	for us to celebrate what is special
845.432	about the human condition,
849.37	that the reasons that govern
849.37	our choices as correct or incorrect
853.997	sometimes run out,
855.687	and it is here, in the space
855.687	of hard choices,
858.786	that we have the power
858.786	to create reasons for ourselves
862.927	to become the distinctive
862.927	people that we are.
866.496	And that's why hard
866.496	choices are not a curse
869.246	but a godsend.
870.967	Thank you.
872.162	(Applause)
