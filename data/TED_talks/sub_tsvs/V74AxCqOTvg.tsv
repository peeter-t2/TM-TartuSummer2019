16.064	Ladies and gentlemen, at TED
16.064	we talk a lot about leadership
19.092	and how to make a movement.
20.697	So let's watch a movement happen,
20.697	start to finish,
23.135	in under three minutes
24.403	and dissect some lessons from it.
26.26	First, of course you know,
27.642	a leader needs the guts
27.642	to stand out and be ridiculed.
32.723	What he's doing is so easy to follow.
34.545	Here's his first follower
34.545	with a crucial role;
36.933	he's going to show everyone
36.933	else how to follow.
39.26	Now, notice that the leader
39.26	embraces him as an equal.
41.839	Now it's not about the leader anymore;
43.808	it's about them, plural.
45.736	Now, there he is calling to his friends.
47.837	Now, if you notice that the first follower
49.861	is actually an underestimated form
49.861	of leadership in itself.
53.26	It takes guts to stand out like that.
55.744	The first follower is what transforms
55.744	a lone nut into a leader.
60.26	(Laughter)
62.26	(Applause)
65.505	And here comes a second follower.
67.26	Now it's not a lone nut,
67.26	it's not two nuts --
69.682	three is a crowd, and a crowd is news.
72.26	So a movement must be public.
74.603	It's important to show
74.603	not just the leader, but the followers,
77.86	because you find that new followers
77.86	emulate the followers, not the leader.
82.26	Now, here come two more people,
82.26	and immediately after,
84.856	three more people.
86.26	Now we've got momentum.
86.26	This is the tipping point.
88.704	Now we've got a movement.
90.505	(Laughter)
91.911	So, notice that, as more people join in,
94.26	it's less risky.
95.848	So those that were sitting
95.848	on the fence before
98.103	now have no reason not to.
99.637	They won't stand out,
99.637	they won't be ridiculed,
103.001	but they will be part
103.001	of the in-crowd if they hurry.
105.834	(Laughter)
108.59	So, over the next minute,
110.129	you'll see all of those that prefer
110.129	to stick with the crowd
112.915	because eventually they would be
112.915	ridiculed for not joining in.
116.2	And that's how you make a movement.
118.201	But let's recap some lessons from this.
120.916	So first, if you are the type,
123.26	like the shirtless dancing guy
123.26	that is standing alone,
126.26	remember the importance of nurturing
126.26	your first few followers as equals
130.26	so it's clearly
130.26	about the movement, not you.
132.734	(Laughter)
133.82	Okay, but we might have missed
133.82	the real lesson here.
136.36	The biggest lesson, if you noticed --
138.26	did you catch it? --
139.805	is that leadership is over-glorified.
142.989	Yes, it was the shirtless guy
142.989	who was first,
145.061	and he'll get all the credit,
146.594	but it was really the first follower
148.408	that transformed the lone nut
148.408	into a leader.
151.748	So, as we're told
151.748	that we should all be leaders,
154.023	that would be really ineffective.
155.639	If you really care
155.639	about starting a movement,
158.067	have the courage to follow
158.067	and show others how to follow.
161.26	And when you find a lone nut
161.26	doing something great,
163.898	have the guts to be the first one
163.898	to stand up and join in.
167.26	And what a perfect place
167.26	to do that, at TED.
170.027	Thanks.
171.26	(Applause)
