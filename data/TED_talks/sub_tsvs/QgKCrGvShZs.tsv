19.608	So, as researchers, something
19.608	that we often do is use immense resources
23.853	to achieve certain capabilities,
23.853	or achieve certain goals.
27.156	And this is essential
27.156	to the progress of science,
29.715	or exploration of what is possible.
32.064	But it creates this unfortunate situation
34.096	where a tiny, tiny fraction of the world
36.136	can actually participate
36.136	in this exploration
38.256	or can benefit from that technology.
40.101	Something that motivates me,
41.53	and gets me really excited
41.53	about my research,
43.767	is when I see simple opportunities
45.497	to drastically change that distribution
45.497	and make the technology accessible
49.321	to a much wider percentage
49.321	of the population.
51.454	I'm going to show you two videos
51.454	that have gotten a lot of attention
55.01	that I think embody this philosophy.
56.804	And they actually use
56.804	the Nintendo Wii Remote.
59.261	For those of you who aren't
59.261	familiar with this device,
61.826	it's a $40 video game controller.
64.547	And it's mostly advertised
64.547	for its motion-sensing capabilities:
67.716	so you can swing a tennis racket,
67.716	or hit a baseball bat.
70.382	But what actually interests me a lot more
72.764	is the fact that in the tip
72.764	of each controller
74.946	is a relatively high-performing
74.946	infrared camera.
77.76	And I'm going to show you
77.76	two demos of why this is useful.
82.243	So here, I have my computer
82.243	set up with the projector,
85.171	and I have a Wii Remote
85.171	sitting on top of it.
87.552	And, for example, if you're in a school
87.552	that doesn't have a lot money,
91.434	probably a lot of schools,
92.885	or if you're in an office environment,
92.885	and you want an interactive whiteboard,
96.591	normally these cost
96.591	about two to three thousand dollars.
99.265	So I'm going to show you
99.265	how to create one with a Wii Remote.
103.397	Now, this requires
103.397	another piece of hardware,
107.005	which is this infrared pen.
108.597	You can probably make
108.597	this yourself for about five dollars
111.431	with a quick trip to the Radio Shack.
113.287	It's got a battery,
113.287	a button and an infrared LED --
115.869	you guys can't see it --
117.051	but it turns on
117.051	whenever I push the button.
119.306	Now, what this means is
119.306	that if I run this piece of software,
123.868	the camera sees the infrared dot,
128.305	and I can register the location
128.305	of the camera pixels
132.514	to the projector pixels.
133.681	And now this is like
133.681	an interactive whiteboard surface.
136.387	(Applause)
138.133	So for about $50 of hardware,
138.133	you can have your own whiteboard.
142.046	This is Adobe Photoshop.
144.253	(Applause)
149.942	Thank you.
151.022	(Laughter)
152.679	The software for this
152.679	I've actually put on my website
155.314	and have let people download it for free.
157.345	In the three months
157.345	this project has been public,
159.74	it's been downloaded
159.74	over half a million times.
162.032	So teachers and students
162.032	all around the world
164.297	are already using this.
165.667	(Applause)
171.09	Although it does do it for 50 dollars,
173.407	there are some limitations
173.407	of this approach.
175.488	You get about 80 percent of the way there,
175.488	for one percent of the cost.
178.914	Another nice thing is that a camera
178.914	can see multiple dots,
181.716	so this is actually a multi-touch,
181.716	interactive whiteboard system as well.
185.203	(Applause)
187.425	For the second demo,
188.577	I have this Wii Remote
188.577	that's actually next to the TV.
191.225	So it's pointing away from the display,
191.225	rather than pointing at the display.
195.449	And why this is interesting
197.736	is that if you put on, say,
197.736	a pair of safety glasses,
201.474	that have two infrared dots in them,
203.312	they are going to give the computer
203.312	an approximation of your head location.
208.589	And why this is interesting
209.915	is I have this sort of application
209.915	running on the computer monitor,
213.082	which has a 3D room,
213.082	with some targets floating in it.
215.638	And you can see that it
215.638	looks like a 3D room.
217.901	kind of like a video game,
217.901	it sort of looks 3D,
221.272	but for the most part,
221.272	the image looks pretty flat,
223.763	and bound to the surface of the screen.
225.645	But if we turn on head tracking --
231.05	the computer can change
231.05	the image that's on the screen
233.859	and make it respond to the head movements.
235.899	So let's switch back to that.
237.304	(Laughter)
240.33	(Applause)
250.975	So this has actually
250.975	been a little bit startling
254.218	to the game-development community.
255.876	(Laughter)
257.722	Because this is about 10 dollars
257.722	of additional hardware
260.602	if you already have a Nintendo Wii.
262.485	So I'm looking forward
262.485	to seeing some games,
264.794	and actually Louis Castle,
264.794	that's him down there,
267.313	last week announced that Electronic Arts,
267.313	one of the largest game publishers,
270.976	is releasing a game in May
270.976	that has a little Easter egg feature
274.001	for supporting this type of head tracking.
276.318	And that's from less than five months
278.268	from a prototype in my lab
278.268	to a major commercial product.
281.418	(Applause)
286.935	Thank you.
288.188	(Applause)
290.451	But actually, to me,
290.451	what's almost more interesting
292.874	than either of these two projects
294.47	is how people actually
294.47	found out about them.
296.789	YouTube has really changed the way,
296.789	or changed the speed,
300.353	in which a single individual
301.711	can actually spread
301.711	an idea around the world.
303.962	I'm doing some research
303.962	in my lab with a video camera,
306.986	and within the first week,
306.986	a million people had seen this work,
309.963	and literally within days,
309.963	engineers, teachers and students
313.578	from around the world were already
313.578	posting their own YouTube videos
316.793	of them using my system
316.793	or derivatives of this work.
320.177	So I hope to see more
320.177	of that in the future,
322.741	and hope online video distribution
322.741	to be embraced by the research community.
326.337	So thank you very much.
327.614	(Applause)
