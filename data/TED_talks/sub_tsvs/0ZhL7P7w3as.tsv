15.26	I just did something I've never done before.
18.26	I spent a week at sea on a research vessel.
21.26	Now I'm not a scientist,
23.26	but I was accompanying a remarkable scientific team
26.26	from the University of South Florida
28.26	who have been tracking the travels of BP's oil
31.26	in the Gulf of Mexico.
33.26	This is the boat we were on, by the way.
36.26	The scientists I was with
38.26	were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff --
41.26	the birds, the turtles,
43.26	the dolphins, the glamorous stuff.
45.26	They're looking at the really little stuff
48.26	that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff
51.26	that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff.
54.26	And what they're finding
56.26	is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants
59.26	can be highly toxic to phytoplankton,
61.26	which is very bad news,
63.26	because so much life depends on it.
66.26	So contrary to what we heard a few months back
68.26	about how 75 percent of that oil
70.26	sort of magically disappeared
72.26	and we didn't have to worry about it,
74.26	this disaster is still unfolding.
77.26	It's still working its way up the food chain.
80.26	Now this shouldn't come as a surprise to us.
83.26	Rachel Carson --
85.26	the godmother of modern environmentalism --
87.26	warned us about this very thing
89.26	back in 1962.
91.26	"She pointed out that the ""control men"" --"
93.26	as she called them --
95.26	who carpet-bombed towns and fields
97.26	with toxic insecticides like DDT,
100.26	were only trying to kill the little stuff, the insects,
103.26	not the birds.
105.26	But they forgot this:
107.26	the fact that birds dine on grubs,
109.26	that robins eat lots of worms
111.26	now saturated with DDT.
114.26	And so, robin eggs failed to hatch,
117.26	songbirds died en masse,
119.26	towns fell silent.
121.26	"Thus the title ""Silent Spring."""
125.26	I've been trying to pinpoint
127.26	what keeps drawing me back to the Gulf of Mexico,
129.26	because I'm Canadian,
131.26	and I can draw no ancestral ties.
133.26	And I think what it is
135.26	is I don't think we have fully come to terms
138.26	with the meaning of this disaster,
141.26	with what it meant to witness a hole
144.26	ripped in our world,
146.26	with what it meant to watch the contents of the Earth
149.26	gush forth on live TV,
153.26	for months.
155.26	After telling ourselves for so long
158.26	that our tools and technology can control nature,
161.26	suddenly we were face-to-face
163.26	with our weakness,
165.26	with our lack of control,
167.26	as the oil burst out
169.26	of every attempt to contain it --
172.26	"""top hats,"" ""top kills"""
174.26	"and, most memorably, the ""junk shot"" --"
176.26	the bright idea
178.26	of firing old tires and golf balls
181.26	down that hole in the world.
183.26	But even more striking
185.26	than the ferocious power emanating from that well
188.26	was the recklessness
190.26	with which that power was unleashed --
192.26	the carelessness, the lack of planning
195.26	that characterized the operation
197.26	from drilling to clean-up.
200.26	If there is one thing
202.26	BP's watery improv act made clear,
205.26	it is that, as a culture,
207.26	we have become far too willing to gamble
209.26	with things that are precious
211.26	and irreplaceable,
213.26	and to do so without a back-up plan,
216.26	without an exit strategy.
218.26	And BP was hardly
220.26	our first experience of this in recent years.
222.26	Our leaders barrel into wars,
224.26	telling themselves happy stories
226.26	about cakewalks and welcome parades.
229.26	Then, it is years of deadly damage control,
232.26	Frankensteins of sieges and surges
235.26	and counter-insurgencies,
237.26	and once again, no exit strategy.
240.26	Our financial wizards routinely fall victim
243.26	to similar overconfidence,
245.26	convincing themselves that the latest bubble
247.26	is a new kind of market --
249.26	the kind that never goes down.
251.26	And when it inevitably does,
253.26	the best and the brightest
255.26	reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot --
257.26	in this case, throwing massive amounts
259.26	of much-needed public money
261.26	down a very different kind of hole.
264.26	As with BP, the hole does get plugged,
266.26	at least temporarily,
268.26	but not before
270.26	exacting a tremendous price.
272.26	We have to figure out
274.26	why we keep letting this happen,
276.26	because we are in the midst
278.26	of what may be our highest-stakes gamble of all --
281.26	deciding what to do, or not to do,
283.26	about climate change.
285.26	Now as you know,
287.26	a great deal of time is spent,
289.26	in this country and around the world,
291.26	inside the climate debate,
293.26	"on the question of, ""What if the IPC scientists"
296.26	"are all wrong?"""
298.26	Now a far more relevant question --
300.26	as MIT physicist Evelyn Fox Keller puts it --
303.26	"is, ""What if those scientists are right?"""
308.26	Given the stakes, the climate crisis
310.26	clearly calls for us to act
312.26	based on the precautionary principle --
315.26	the theory that holds
317.26	that when human health and the environment
319.26	are significantly at risk
321.26	and when the potential damage is irreversible,
324.26	we cannot afford to wait
326.26	for perfect scientific certainty.
328.26	Better to err on the side of caution.
331.26	More overt, the burden of proving
333.26	that a practice is safe
335.26	should not be placed on the public that would be harmed,
338.26	but rather on the industry that stands to profit.
342.26	But climate policy in the wealthy world --
344.26	to the extent that such a thing exists --
347.26	is not based on precaution,
349.26	but rather on cost-benefit analysis --
352.26	finding the course of action that economists believe
354.26	will have the least impact
356.26	on our GDP.
358.26	So rather than asking, as precaution would demand,
361.26	what can we do as quickly as possible
363.26	to avoid potential catastrophe,
366.26	we ask bizarre questions like this:
369.26	"""What is the latest possible moment we can wait"
372.26	before we begin seriously lowering emissions?
375.26	Can we put this off till 2020,
380.26	Or we ask,
382.26	"""How much hotter can we let the planet get"
384.26	and still survive?
386.26	Can we go with two degrees, three degrees, or --
388.26	where we're currently going --
390.26	"four degrees Celsius?"""
392.26	And by the way,
394.26	the assumption that we can safely control
396.26	the Earth's awesomely complex climate system
399.26	as if it had a thermostat,
401.26	making the planet not too hot, not too cold,
404.26	but just right -- sort of Goldilocks style --
407.26	this is pure fantasy,
409.26	and it's not coming from the climate scientists.
412.26	It's coming from the economists
414.26	imposing their mechanistic thinking
416.26	on the science.
418.26	The fact is that we simply don't know
420.26	when the warming that we create
422.26	will be utterly overwhelmed
424.26	by feedback loops.
426.26	So once again,
428.26	why do we take these crazy risks
430.26	with the precious?
432.26	A range of explanations
434.26	may be popping into your mind by now,
436.26	"like ""greed."""
438.26	This is a popular explanation, and there's lots of truth to it,
441.26	because taking big risks, as we all know,
444.26	pays a lot of money.
446.26	Another explanation that you often hear for recklessness
448.26	is hubris.
450.26	And greed and hubris
452.26	are intimately intertwined
454.26	when it comes to recklessness.
456.26	For instance, if you happen to be a 35-year-old banker
459.26	taking home 100 times more
461.26	than a brain surgeon,
463.26	then you need a narrative,
465.26	you need a story
467.26	that makes that disparity okay.
469.26	And you actually don't have a lot of options.
472.26	You're either an incredibly good scammer,
475.26	and you're getting away with it -- you gamed the system --
477.26	or you're some kind of boy genius,
479.26	the likes of which the world has never seen.
482.26	Now both of these options -- the boy genius and the scammer --
485.26	are going to make you vastly overconfident
487.26	and therefore more prone
489.26	to taking even bigger risks in the future.
493.26	By the way, Tony Hayward, the former CEO of BP,
496.26	had a plaque on his desk
498.26	inscribed with this inspirational slogan:
500.26	"""What would you attempt to do"
502.26	"if you knew you could not fail?"""
505.26	Now this is actually a popular plaque,
508.26	and this is a crowd of overachievers,
510.26	so I'm betting that some of you have this plaque.
513.26	Don't feel ashamed.
515.26	Putting fear of failure out of your mind
517.26	can be a very good thing
519.26	if you're training for a triathlon
521.26	or preparing to give a TEDTalk,
524.26	but personally, I think people with the power
526.26	to detonate our economy and ravage our ecology
529.26	would do better having
531.26	a picture of Icarus hanging from the wall,
533.26	because -- maybe not that one in particular --
536.26	but I want them thinking about the possibility of failure
539.26	all of the time.
541.26	So we have greed,
543.26	we've got overconfidence/hubris,
545.26	but since we're here at TEDWomen,
547.26	let's consider one other factor
549.26	that could be contributing in some small way
551.26	to societal recklessness.
555.26	Now I'm not going to belabor this point,
557.26	but studies do show that, as investors,
559.26	women are much less prone
561.26	to taking reckless risks than men,
564.26	precisely because, as we've already heard,
566.26	women tend not to suffer from overconfidence
569.26	in the same way that men do.
571.26	So it turns out
573.26	that being paid less and praised less
575.26	has its upsides --
577.26	for society at least.
579.26	The flipside of this
581.26	is that constantly being told
583.26	that you are gifted, chosen
585.26	and born to rule
587.26	has distinct societal downsides.
590.26	"And this problem -- call it the ""perils of privilege"" --"
593.26	brings us closer, I think,
595.26	to the root of our collective recklessness.
598.26	Because none of us -- at least in the global North --
600.26	neither men nor women,
602.26	are fully exempt from this message.
605.26	Here's what I'm talking about.
607.26	Whether we actively believe them
609.26	or consciously reject them,
611.26	our culture remains in the grips
613.26	of certain archetypal stories
615.26	about our supremacy
617.26	over others and over nature --
619.26	the narrative of the newly discovered frontier
622.26	and the conquering pioneer,
624.26	the narrative of manifest destiny,
626.26	the narrative of apocalypse and salvation.
628.26	And just when you think these stories are fading into history,
630.26	and that we've gotten over them,
632.26	they pop up in the strangest places.
635.26	For instance, I stumbled across this advertisement
637.26	outside the women's washroom
639.26	in the Kansas City airport.
641.26	It's for Motorola's new Rugged cell phone,
643.26	and yes, it really does say,
645.26	"""Slap Mother Nature in the face."""
647.26	And I'm not just showing it to pick on Motorola --
649.26	that's just a bonus.
651.26	I'm showing it because --
653.26	they're not a sponsor, are they? --
655.26	because, in its own way,
657.26	this is a crass version
659.26	of our founding story.
661.26	We slapped Mother Nature around and won,
663.26	and we always win,
665.26	because dominating nature is our destiny.
668.26	But this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature.
671.26	There's another one, equally important,
674.26	about how that very same Mother Nature
676.26	is so nurturing and so resilient
679.26	that we can never make a dent in her abundance.
682.26	Let's hear from Tony Hayward again.
684.26	"""The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean."
687.26	The amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it
690.26	"is tiny in relation to the total water volume."""
693.26	In other words, the ocean is big;
695.26	she can take it.
698.26	It is this underlying assumption of limitlessness
701.26	that makes it possible
703.26	to take the reckless risks that we do.
706.26	Because this is our real master-narrative:
709.26	however much we mess up,
711.26	there will always be more --
713.26	more water, more land,
716.26	more untapped resources.
718.26	A new bubble will replace the old one.
720.26	A new technology will come along
722.26	to fix the messes we made with the last one.
725.26	In a way, that is the story
727.26	of the settling of the Americas,
729.26	the supposedly inexhaustible frontier
731.26	to which Europeans escaped.
734.26	And it's also the story of modern capitalism,
737.26	because it was the wealth from this land
739.26	that gave birth to our economic system,
742.26	one that cannot survive without perpetual growth
745.26	and an unending supply
747.26	of new frontiers.
749.26	Now the problem is
751.26	that the story was always a lie.
753.26	The Earth always did have limits.
755.26	They were just beyond our sights.
757.26	And now we are hitting those limits
759.26	on multiple fronts.
762.26	I believe that we know this,
764.26	yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop.
767.26	Not only do we continue to tell and retell
770.26	the same tired stories,
772.26	but we are now doing so
774.26	with a frenzy and a fury
776.26	that, frankly, verges on camp.
779.26	How else to explain the cultural space
782.26	occupied by Sarah Palin?
784.26	Now on the one hand,
786.26	"exhorting us to ""drill, baby, drill,"""
788.26	because God put those resources into the ground
791.26	in order for us to exploit them,
794.26	and on the other, glorying in the wilderness
797.26	of Alaska's untouched beauty
799.26	on her hit reality TV show.
802.26	The twin message is as comforting as it is mad.
805.26	Ignore those creeping fears
807.26	that we have finally hit the wall.
809.26	There are still no limits.
811.26	There will always be another frontier.
814.26	So stop worrying and keep shopping.
817.26	Now, would that this were just about
819.26	Sarah Palin and her reality TV show.
821.26	In environmental circles,
823.26	we often hear that, rather than shifting to renewables,
826.26	we are continuing with business as usual.
829.26	This assessment, unfortunately,
831.26	is far too optimistic.
833.26	The truth is that we have already exhausted
836.26	so much of the easily accessible fossil fuels
839.26	that we have already entered
841.26	a far riskier business era,
844.26	the era of extreme energy.
846.26	So that means drilling for oil in the deepest water,
849.26	including the icy Arctic seas,
851.26	where a clean-up may simply be impossible.
854.26	It means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas
857.26	and massive strip-mining operations for coal,
859.26	the likes of which we haven't yet seen.
862.26	And most controversially, it means the tar sands.
865.26	I'm always surprised by how little
867.26	people outside of Canada
869.26	know about the Alberta Tar Sands,
871.26	which this year are projected to become
873.26	the number one source of imported oil
876.26	to the United States.
878.26	It's worth taking a moment to understand this practice,
881.26	because I believe it speaks to recklessness
883.26	and the path we're on
885.26	like little else.
887.26	So this is where the tar sands live,
890.26	under one of the last magnificent
892.26	Boreal forests.
894.26	The oil is not liquid.
896.26	You can't just drill a hole and pump it out.
898.26	Tar sand's oil is solid,
900.26	mixed in with the soil.
902.26	So to get at it,
904.26	you first have to get rid of the trees.
907.26	Then, you rip off the topsoil
909.26	and get at that oily sand.
912.26	The process requires a huge amount of water,
915.26	which is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds.
919.26	That's very bad news for local indigenous people
922.26	living downstream
924.26	who are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates.
927.26	Now looking at these images,
929.26	it's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation,
932.26	which can already be seen from space
935.26	and could grow to an area the size of England.
938.26	I find it helps actually
940.26	to look at the dump trucks that move the earth,
942.26	the largest ever built.
944.26	That's a person down there by the wheel.
946.26	My point is that
948.26	this is not oil drilling.
950.26	It's not even mining.
952.26	It is terrestrial skinning.
954.26	Vast, vivid landscapes
956.26	are being gutted,
958.26	left monochromatic gray.
960.26	Now I should confess that as [far as] I'm concerned
963.26	this would be an abomination
965.26	if it emitted not one particle of carbon.
967.26	But the truth is that, on average,
970.26	turning that gunk into crude oil
973.26	produces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution
976.26	than it does to produce conventional oil
978.26	in Canada.
980.26	How else to describe this,
982.26	but as a form of mass insanity?
985.26	Just when we know we need to be learning
988.26	to live on the surface of our planet,
990.26	off the power of sun, wind and waves,
993.26	we are frantically digging
995.26	to get at the dirtiest,
997.26	highest-emitting stuff imaginable.
1000.26	This is where our story of endless growth
1002.26	has taken us,
1004.26	to this black hole at the center of my country --
1007.26	a place of such planetary pain
1009.26	that, like the BP gusher,
1011.26	one can only stand to look at it for so long.
1015.26	As Jared Diamond and others have shown us,
1018.26	this is how civilizations commit suicide,
1021.26	by slamming their foot on the accelerator
1024.26	at the exact moment
1026.26	when they should be putting on the brakes.
1028.26	The problem is that our master-narrative
1031.26	has an answer for that too.
1033.26	At the very last minute, we are going to get saved
1036.26	just like in every Hollywood movie,
1038.26	just like in the Rapture.
1041.26	But, of course, our secular religion is technology.
1044.26	Now, you may have noticed
1047.26	more and more headlines like these.
1049.26	"The idea behind this form of ""geoengineering"" as it's called,"
1052.26	is that, as the planet heats up,
1054.26	we may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particles
1057.26	into the stratosphere
1059.26	to reflect some of the sun's rays
1061.26	back to space,
1063.26	thereby cooling the planet.
1066.26	The wackiest plan -- and I'm not making this up --
1068.26	would put what is essentially a garden hose
1074.26	suspended by balloons,
1076.26	to spew sulfur dioxide.
1078.26	So, solving the problem of pollution with more pollution.
1081.26	Think of it as the ultimate junk shot.
1085.26	The serious scientists involved in this research
1087.26	all stress that these techniques
1089.26	are entirely untested.
1091.26	They don't know if they'll work,
1093.26	and they have no idea
1095.26	what kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash.
1098.26	Nevertheless, the mere mention of geoengineering
1101.26	is being greeted in some circles,
1103.26	particularly media circles,
1105.26	with a relief tinged with euphoria.
1107.26	An escape hatch has been reached.
1109.26	A new frontier has been found.
1111.26	Most importantly,
1113.26	we don't have to change our lifestyles after all.
1115.26	You see, for some people,
1117.26	their savior is a guy in a flowing robe.
1119.26	For other people, it's a guy with a garden hose.
1123.26	We badly need some new stories.
1126.26	We need stories that have different kinds of heroes
1129.26	willing to take different kinds of risks --
1132.26	risks that confront recklessness head on,
1134.26	that put the precautionary principle into practice,
1137.26	even if that means through direct action --
1140.26	like hundreds of young people willing to get arrested,
1142.26	blocking dirty power plants
1144.26	or fighting mountaintop-removal coal mining.
1147.26	We need stories
1149.26	that replace that linear narrative of endless growth
1152.26	with circular narratives
1154.26	that remind us
1156.26	that what goes around comes around.
1158.26	That this is our only home.
1160.26	There is no escape hatch.
1162.26	Call it karma, call it physics,
1165.26	action and reaction, call it precaution --
1168.26	the principle that reminds us
1170.26	that life is too precious to be risked
1172.26	for any profit.
1174.26	Thank you.
