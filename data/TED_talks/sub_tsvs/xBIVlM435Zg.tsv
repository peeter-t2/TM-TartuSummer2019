25.738	I'm going to give you
25.738	four specific examples,
28.367	I'm going to cover at the end
30.257	about how a company called Silk
30.257	tripled their sales;
32.932	how an artist named Jeff Koons
32.932	went from being a nobody
36	to making a whole bunch of money
36	and having a lot of impact;
39	to how Frank Gehry redefined
39	what it meant to be an architect.
42.5	And one of my biggest failures
42.5	as a marketer in the last few years --
46.119	a record label I started
46.119	"that had a CD called ""Sauce."""
50.126	Before I can do that
50.126	I've got to tell you about sliced bread,
53.078	and a guy named Otto Rohwedder.
54.801	Now, before sliced bread
54.801	was invented in the 1910s
58.084	I wonder what they said?
60.055	Like the greatest invention
60.055	since the telegraph or something.
63.175	But this guy named Otto Rohwedder
63.175	invented sliced bread,
66.467	and he focused, like most inventors did,
66.467	on the patent part and the making part.
71.89	And the thing about the invention
71.89	of sliced bread is this --
74.747	that for the first 15 years
74.747	after sliced bread was available
78.836	no one bought it; no one knew about it;
81.226	it was a complete and total failure.
83.923	And the reason
83.923	is that until Wonder came along
88.5	and figured out how to spread
88.5	the idea of sliced bread,
92.266	no one wanted it.
93.855	That the success of sliced bread,
95.5	like the success of almost everything
95.5	we've talked about at this conference,
99.17	is not always about what the patent
99.17	is like, or what the factory is like --
105.834	it's about can you get
105.834	your idea to spread, or not.
109.234	And I think that the way
109.234	you're going to get what you want,
112.512	or cause the change that you want
112.512	to change, to happen,
115.456	is to figure out a way
115.456	to get your ideas to spread.
117.948	And it doesn't matter to me
117.948	whether you're running a coffee shop
121.22	or you're an intellectual,
121.22	or you're in business,
123.534	or you're flying hot air balloons.
126.077	I think that all this stuff applies
126.077	to everybody regardless of what we do.
132.242	That what we are living in
132.242	is a century of idea diffusion.
137.06	That people who can spread ideas,
137.06	regardless of what those ideas are, win.
141.723	When I talk about it
141.723	I usually pick business,
143.918	because they make the best pictures
143.918	that you can put in your presentation,
147.447	and because it's the easiest
147.447	sort of way to keep score.
150.137	But I want you to forgive me
150.137	when I use these examples
152.719	because I'm talking about anything
152.719	that you decide to spend your time to do.
156.344	At the heart of spreading ideas
156.344	is TV and stuff like TV.
161.348	TV and mass media made it really easy
161.348	to spread ideas in a certain way.
167.97	"I call it the ""TV-industrial complex."""
170.319	The way the TV-industrial complex works,
170.319	is you buy some ads,
173.462	interrupt some people,
173.462	that gets you distribution.
176.535	You use the distribution you get
176.535	to sell more products.
180.303	You take the profit
180.303	from that to buy more ads.
183.938	And it goes around and around and around,
185.938	the same way that the military-industrial
185.938	complex worked a long time ago.
189.439	That model of,
189.439	and we heard it yesterday --
191.51	if we could only get
191.51	onto the homepage of Google,
193.827	if we could only figure out
193.827	how to get promoted there,
196.39	or grab that person by the throat,
198.128	and tell them about what we want to do.
200.917	If we did that then everyone would pay
200.917	attention, and we would win.
204.869	Well, this TV-industrial complex informed
204.869	my entire childhood and probably yours.
210.299	I mean, all of these products succeeded
210.299	because someone figured out
215.092	how to touch people in a way
215.092	they weren't expecting,
218.18	in a way they didn't
218.18	necessarily want, with an ad,
220.544	over and over again until they bought it.
222.797	And the thing that's happened is,
222.797	they canceled the TV-industrial complex.
227.302	That just over the last few years,
229.628	what anybody who markets
229.628	anything has discovered
232.476	is that it's not working
232.476	the way that it used to.
234.92	This picture is really fuzzy, I apologize;
234.92	I had a bad cold when I took it.
238.533	(Laughter)
240.112	But the product in the blue box
240.112	in the center is my poster child.
243.631	I go to the deli; I'm sick;
243.631	I need to buy some medicine.
247.02	The brand manager for that blue product
247.02	spent 100 million dollars
250.381	trying to interrupt me in one year.
	with TV commercials
255.378	and magazine ads and Spam
257.27	and coupons and shelving
257.27	allowances and spiff --
260.094	all so I could ignore
260.094	every single message.
263.014	And I ignored every message
265.071	because I don't have
265.071	a pain reliever problem.
267.213	I buy the stuff in the yellow box
267.213	because I always have.
269.893	And I'm not going to invest a minute
269.893	of my time to solve her problem,
274.172	because I don't care.
276.156	"Here's a magazine called ""Hydrate."""
276.156	It's 180 pages about water.
281.743	(Laughter)
282.768	Articles about water, ads about water.
285.482	Imagine what the world
285.482	was like 40 years ago,
288.618	with just the Saturday Evening Post
288.618	and Time and Newsweek.
291.366	Now there are magazines about water.
293.154	New product from Coke Japan: water salad.
296.336	(Laughter)
297.385	Coke Japan comes out
297.385	with a new product every three weeks,
302.043	because they have no idea
302.043	what's going to work and what's not.
305.583	I couldn't have written
305.583	this better myself.
307.692	It came out four days ago --
309.234	I circled the important parts
309.234	so you can see them here.
313.106	They've come out...
314.289	Arby's is going to spend
318.854	with the voice of Tom Arnold,
321.203	hoping that that will get people to go
321.203	to Arby's and buy a roast beef sandwich.
326.075	(Laughter)
327.105	Now, I had tried to imagine what could
327.105	possibly be in an animated TV commercial
332.653	featuring Tom Arnold,
332.653	that would get you to get in your car,
336.185	drive across town
336.185	and buy a roast beef sandwich.
339.399	(Laughter)
340.796	Now, this is Copernicus, and he was right,
344.2	when he was talking to anyone
344.2	who needs to hear your idea.
346.961	"""The world revolves around me."""
348.637	Me, me, me, me. My favorite person -- me.
351.652	I don't want to get email
351.652	"from anybody; I want to get ""memail."""
354.962	(Laughter)
356.5	So consumers, and I don't just mean
356.5	people who buy stuff at the Safeway;
362.174	I mean people at the Defense Department
362.174	who might buy something,
365.31	or people at, you know, the New Yorker
365.31	who might print your article.
368.556	Consumers don't care about you
368.556	at all; they just don't care.
373.375	Part of the reason is -- they've got
373.375	way more choices than they used to,
377.192	and way less time.
379.34	And in a world where we have
379.34	too many choices and too little time,
383.333	the obvious thing to do
383.333	is just ignore stuff.
387.868	And my parable here
387.868	is you're driving down the road
391.447	and you see a cow, and you keep driving
391.447	because you've seen cows before.
395.32	Cows are invisible. Cows are boring.
398.178	Who's going to stop and pull over
398.178	"and say -- ""Oh, look, a cow."""
401.604	Nobody.
402.779	(Laughter)
404.5	But if the cow was purple --
404.5	isn't that a great special effect?
408.168	I could do that again if you want.
409.851	If the cow was purple,
409.851	you'd notice it for a while.
414.5	I mean, if all cows were purple
414.5	you'd get bored with those, too.
417.873	The thing that's going to decide
417.873	what gets talked about,
421.392	what gets done, what gets changed,
423.119	what gets purchased, what gets built,
425.577	"is: ""Is it remarkable?"""
428.502	"And ""remarkable"" is a really cool word,"
430.863	"because we think it just means ""neat,"""
432.932	but it also means
432.932	"""worth making a remark about."""
436.776	And that is the essence
436.776	of where idea diffusion is going.
441.078	That two of the hottest cars
441.078	in the United States
444.097	is a 55,000-dollar giant car,
447.278	big enough to hold a Mini in its trunk.
450.413	People are paying full price for both,
452.53	and the only thing they have in common
455.343	is that they don't have
455.343	anything in common.
458.303	(Laughter)
459.501	Every week, the number one
459.501	best-selling DVD in America changes.
465.202	"It's never ""The Godfather,"""
465.202	"it's never ""Citizen Kane,"""
468.051	it's always some third-rate movie
468.051	with some second-rate star.
471.915	But the reason it's number one
471.915	is because that's the week it came out.
476.5	Because it's new, because it's fresh.
478.5	People saw it and said
478.5	"""I didn't know that was there"""
481.004	and they noticed it.
482.275	Two of the big success stories
482.275	of the last 20 years in retail --
485.452	one sells things that are
485.452	super-expensive in a blue box,
488.438	and one sells things that are
488.438	as cheap as they can make them.
491.914	The only thing they have in common
491.914	is that they're different.
494.804	We're now in the fashion business,
494.804	no matter what we do for a living,
498.16	we're in the fashion business.
499.714	And people in the fashion business
501.5	know what it's like to be in the fashion
501.5	business -- they're used to it.
504.927	The rest of us have to figure out
504.927	how to think that way.
507.578	How to understand
508.824	that it's not about interrupting
508.824	people with big full-page ads,
512.131	or insisting on meetings with people.
514.733	But it's a totally different
514.733	sort of process
517.573	that determines which ideas spread,
517.573	and which ones don't.
520.5	They sold a billion dollars'
520.5	worth of Aeron chairs
524.47	by reinventing
524.47	what it meant to sell a chair.
527.86	They turned a chair from something
527.86	the purchasing department bought,
531.105	to something that was a status symbol
531.105	about where you sat at work.
535.692	This guy, Lionel Poilâne,
535.692	the most famous baker in the world --
538.945	he died two and a half months ago,
541.056	and he was a hero of mine
541.056	and a dear friend.
543.128	He lived in Paris.
544.342	Last year, he sold 10 million dollars'
544.342	worth of French bread.
548.588	Every loaf baked in a bakery he owned,
551.1	by one baker at a time,
551.1	in a wood-fired oven.
554.22	And when Lionel started his bakery,
554.22	the French pooh-pooh-ed it.
558.022	They didn't want to buy his bread.
559.706	"It didn't look like ""French bread."""
561.471	It wasn't what they expected.
562.876	It was neat; it was remarkable;
565.77	and slowly, it spread
565.77	from one person to another person
569.107	until finally, it became the official
569.107	bread of three-star restaurants in Paris.
573.397	Now he's in London, and he ships
573.397	by FedEx all around the world.
576.967	What marketers used to do is make
576.967	average products for average people.
582.134	That's what mass marketing is.
583.951	Smooth out the edges; go for the center;
583.951	that's the big market.
588.103	They would ignore the geeks,
588.103	and God forbid, the laggards.
592.5	It was all about going for the center.
594.999	But in a world where
594.999	the TV-industrial complex is broken,
598.191	I don't think that's a strategy
598.191	we want to use any more.
600.835	I think the strategy we want to use
600.835	is to not market to these people
604.633	because they're really good
604.633	at ignoring you.
606.943	But market to these
606.943	people because they care.
610.5	These are the people
610.5	who are obsessed with something.
614.68	And when you talk to them, they'll listen,
616.744	because they like listening --
616.744	it's about them.
619.387	And if you're lucky, they'll tell
619.387	their friends on the rest of the curve,
623.366	and it'll spread.
624.577	It'll spread to the entire curve.
626.38	"They have something I call ""otaku"" --"
626.38	it's a great Japanese word.
630.043	It describes the desire
630.043	of someone who's obsessed to say,
633.065	drive across Tokyo to try
633.065	a new ramen noodle place,
635.922	because that's what they do:
635.922	they get obsessed with it.
638.88	To make a product, to market an idea,
641.261	to come up with any problem
641.261	you want to solve
643.381	that doesn't have
643.381	a constituency with an otaku,
646.714	is almost impossible.
648.301	Instead, you have to find
648.301	a group that really, desperately cares
651.967	about what it is you have to say.
653.634	Talk to them and make it easy
653.634	for them to tell their friends.
656.741	There's a hot sauce otaku,
656.741	but there's no mustard otaku.
660.883	That's why there's lots and lots
660.883	of kinds of hot sauces,
663.582	and not so many kinds of mustard.
665.193	Not because it's hard
665.193	to make interesting mustard --
667.7	you could make interesting mustard --
669.515	but people don't,
669.515	because no one's obsessed with it,
672.014	and thus no one tells their friends.
673.819	Krispy Kreme has figured
673.819	this whole thing out.
676.222	It has a strategy, and what they do is,
678.126	they enter a city, they talk
678.126	to the people, with the otaku,
680.957	and then they spread through the city
682.903	to the people who've just
682.903	crossed the street.
685.023	This yoyo right here cost 112 dollars,
685.023	but it sleeps for 12 minutes.
689.481	Not everybody wants it
689.481	but they don't care.
691.542	They want to talk to the people
691.542	who do, and maybe it'll spread.
695.093	These guys make the loudest
695.093	car stereo in the world.
698.5	(Laughter)
700.5	It's as loud as a 747 jet.
702.668	You can't get in,
702.668	the car's got bulletproof glass,
705.643	because it'll blow out
705.643	the windshield otherwise.
707.906	But the fact remains
709.233	that when someone wants to put
709.233	a couple of speakers in their car,
712.391	if they've got the otaku
712.391	or they've heard from someone who does,
715.415	they go ahead and they pick this.
717.096	It's really simple -- you sell
717.096	to the people who are listening,
720.111	and just maybe,
720.111	those people tell their friends.
722.457	So when Steve Jobs talks
722.457	to 50,000 people at his keynote,
725.738	who are all tuned in from 130 countries
728.382	watching his two-hour commercial --
730.5	that's the only thing keeping
730.5	his company in business --
733.144	it's that those 50,000 people
733.144	care desperately enough
735.817	to watch a two-hour commercial,
735.817	and then tell their friends.
738.651	Pearl Jam, 96 albums released
738.651	in the last two years.
741.356	Every one made a profit. How?
743.737	They only sell them on their website.
745.548	Those people who buy them have the otaku,
747.674	and then they tell their friends,
747.674	and it spreads and it spreads.
750.751	This hospital crib cost 10,000 dollars,
755.082	But hospitals are buying it
755.082	faster than any other model.
757.78	Hard Candy nail polish,
757.78	doesn't appeal to everybody,
760.5	but to the people who love it,
760.5	they talk about it like crazy.
764.003	This paint can right here saved
764.003	the Dutch Boy paint company,
769.67	making them a fortune.
770.983	It costs 35 percent more
770.983	than regular paint
773.054	because Dutch Boy made a can that people
773.054	talk about, because it's remarkable.
777.119	They didn't just slap
777.119	a new ad on the product;
779.286	they changed what it meant
779.286	to build a paint product.
781.803	AmIhotornot.com -- everyday
786.5	run by two volunteers, and I can
786.5	tell you they are hard graders --
790.5	(Laughter)
794.334	They didn't get this way
794.334	by advertising a lot.
797.406	They got this way by being remarkable,
800.194	sometimes a little too remarkable.
801.983	And this picture frame
801.983	has a cord going out the back,
806.306	and you plug it into the wall.
807.979	My father has this on his desk,
809.852	and he sees his grandchildren
809.852	everyday, changing constantly.
814.312	And every single person
814.312	who walks into his office
816.883	hears the whole story
816.883	of how this thing ended up on his desk.
819.836	And one person at a time,
819.836	the idea spreads.
822.5	These are not diamonds, not really.
825.732	"They're made from ""cremains."""
827.827	After you're cremated you can
827.827	have yourself made into a gem.
830.661	(Laughter)
831.732	Oh, you like my ring? It's my grandmother.
834.042	(Laughter)
839.755	Fastest-growing business
839.755	in the whole mortuary industry.
843.244	But you don't have to be Ozzie Osborne --
845.293	you don't have to be
845.293	super-outrageous to do this.
847.603	What you have to do
848.841	is figure out what people
848.841	really want and give it to them.
851.632	A couple of quick rules to wrap up.
853.323	The first one is: Design
853.323	is free when you get to scale.
857.066	The people who come up
857.066	with stuff that's remarkable
859.478	more often than not figure out
859.478	how to put design to work for them.
862.692	Number two: The riskiest thing
862.692	you can do now is be safe.
867.572	Proctor and Gamble knows this, right?
869.5	The whole model of being
869.5	Proctor and Gamble
871.572	is always about average products
871.572	for average people.
874.027	That's risky.
875.521	The safe thing to do now
875.521	is to be at the fringes,
878.399	be remarkable.
880.11	And being very good is one
880.11	of the worst things you can possibly do.
884.181	Very good is boring. Very good is average.
887.007	It doesn't matter whether
887.007	you're making a record album,
889.61	or you're an architect,
889.61	or you have a tract on sociology.
892.331	If it's very good, it's not going to work,
892.331	because no one's going to notice it.
896.223	So my three stories.
897.623	Silk put a product that does not need
897.623	to be in the refrigerated section
902.139	next to the milk
902.139	in the refrigerated section.
904.48	Sales tripled. Why?
906.29	Milk, milk, milk, milk, milk -- not milk.
909.662	For the people who were there
909.662	and looking at that section,
912.754	it was remarkable.
913.984	They didn't triple their sales
913.984	with advertising;
916.247	they tripled it by doing
916.247	something remarkable.
918.453	That is a remarkable piece of art.
920.237	You don't have to like it,
921.531	but a 40-foot tall dog made out of bushes
921.531	in the middle of New York City
926.119	is remarkable.
927.294	(Laughter)
928.389	Frank Gehry didn't just change a museum;
930.331	he changed an entire city's economy
933.241	by designing one building that people
933.241	from all over the world went to see.
937.823	Now, at countless meetings at, you know,
939.752	the Portland City Council,
939.752	or who knows where,
942.5	they said, we need an architect --
942.5	can we get Frank Gehry?
945.785	Because he did something
945.785	that was at the fringes.
948.5	And my big failure?
948.5	I came out with an entire --
950.767	(Music)
953.5	A record album and hopefully
953.5	a whole bunch of record albums
956.291	in SACD, this remarkable new format --
958.96	and I marketed it straight to people
958.96	with 20,000-dollar stereos.
962.285	People with 20,000-dollar stereos
962.285	don't like new music.
967.405	(Laughter)
971.888	So what you need to do
971.888	is figure out who does care.
977.137	Who is going to raise their hand and say,
979.152	"""I want to hear what you're doing next,"""
981.105	and sell something to them.
982.965	The last example I want to give you.
984.704	This is a map of Soap Lake, Washington.
986.933	As you can see, if that's nowhere,
986.933	it's in the middle of it.
990.5	(Laughter)
996.043	But they do have a lake.
998.452	And people used to come from miles
998.452	around to swim in the lake.
1001.382	They don't anymore.
1002.571	So the founding fathers said,
1002.571	"""We've got some money to spend."
1005.478	"What can we build here?"""
1006.953	And like most committees,
1008.471	they were going to build
1008.471	something pretty safe.
1010.687	And then an artist came to them --
1010.687	this is a true artist's rendering --
1014.045	he wants to build a 55-foot tall
1014.045	lava lamp in the center of town.
1019.646	That's a purple cow;
1019.646	that's something worth noticing.
1022.948	I don't know about you,
1024.131	but if they build it,
1024.131	that's where I'm going to go.
1026.536	Thank you very much for your attention.
