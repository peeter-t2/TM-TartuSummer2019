12.378	I have a question:
14.271	Who here remembers when they first realized
17.648	they were going to die?
21.071	I do. I was a young boy,
23.573	and my grandfather had just died,
26.628	and I remember a few days later lying in bed at night
30.546	trying to make sense of what had happened.
34.18	What did it mean that he was dead?
36.815	Where had he gone?
38.599	It was like a hole in reality had opened up
42.021	and swallowed him.
44.156	But then the really shocking
44.156	question occurred to me:
46.958	If he could die, could it happen to me too?
50.448	Could that hole in reality open up and swallow me?
53.747	Would it open up beneath my bed
55.537	and swallow me as I slept?
58.771	Well, at some point, all children
58.771	become aware of death.
62.959	It can happen in different ways, of course,
64.864	and usually comes in stages.
66.697	Our idea of death develops as we grow older.
70.21	And if you reach back into the dark corners
72.939	of your memory,
74.636	you might remember something like what I felt
77.639	when my grandfather died and when I realized
80.894	it could happen to me too,
82.844	that sense that behind all of this
85.423	the void is waiting.
88.76	And this development in childhood
91.037	reflects the development of our species.
93.858	Just as there was a point in your development
97.173	as a child when your sense of self and of time
100.699	became sophisticated enough
102.798	for you to realize you were mortal,
106.72	so at some point in the evolution of our species,
110.426	some early human's sense of self and of time
113.441	became sophisticated enough
115.684	for them to become the first human to realize,
118.799	"""I'm going to die."""
122.232	This is, if you like, our curse.
124.451	It's the price we pay for being so damn clever.
128.494	We have to live in the knowledge
130.593	that the worst thing that can possibly happen
133.254	one day surely will,
134.878	the end of all our projects,
136.384	our hopes, our dreams, of our individual world.
139.848	We each live in the shadow of a personal
143.029	apocalypse.
145.018	And that's frightening. It's terrifying.
147.522	And so we look for a way out.
149.982	And in my case, as I was about five years old,
153.263	this meant asking my mum.
156.258	Now when I first started asking
158.72	what happens when we die,
160.501	the grown-ups around me at the time
162.593	answered with a typical English mix of awkwardness
165.796	and half-hearted Christianity,
168.783	and the phrase I heard most often
170.727	was that granddad was now
172.286	"""up there looking down on us,"""
174.75	and if I should die too, which
174.75	wouldn't happen of course,
177.715	then I too would go up there,
180.511	which made death sound a lot like
182.561	an existential elevator.
185.215	Now this didn't sound very plausible.
188.333	I used to watch a children's
188.333	news program at the time,
191.236	and this was the era of space exploration.
193.676	There were always rockets going up into the sky,
195.85	up into space, going up there.
198.546	But none of the astronauts when they came back
200.875	ever mentioned having met my granddad
204.107	or any other dead people.
206.566	But I was scared,
207.869	and the idea of taking the existential elevator
210.309	to see my granddad
211.915	sounded a lot better than being swallowed
213.33	by the void while I slept.
216.401	And so I believed it anyway,
218.67	even though it didn't make much sense.
221.341	And this thought process that I went through
223.583	as a child, and have been through many times since,
226.114	including as a grown-up,
228.024	is a product of what psychologists call
230.471	a bias.
231.935	Now a bias is a way in which we systematically
235.209	get things wrong,
236.927	ways in which we miscalculate, misjudge,
239.611	distort reality, or see what we want to see,
243.2	and the bias I'm talking about
245.432	works like this:
246.87	Confront someone with the fact
249.105	that they are going to die
250.652	and they will believe just about any story
253.685	that tells them it isn't true
255.543	and they can, instead, live forever,
257.957	even if it means taking the existential elevator.
262.042	Now we can see this as the biggest bias of all.
266.47	It has been demonstrated in over 400
269.345	empirical studies.
271.026	Now these studies are ingenious, but they're simple.
273.535	They work like this.
275.47	You take two groups of people
276.96	who are similar in all relevant respects,
279.743	and you remind one group that they're going to die
282.432	but not the other, then you compare their behavior.
285.061	So you're observing how it biases behavior
288.934	when people become aware of their mortality.
292.688	And every time, you get the same result:
295.6	People who are made aware of their mortality
298.687	are more willing to believe stories
300.698	that tell them they can escape death
302.561	and live forever.
304.333	So here's an example: One recent study
306.622	took two groups of agnostics,
309.392	that is people who are undecided
310.988	in their religious beliefs.
313.503	Now, one group was asked to think about being dead.
317.087	The other group was asked to think about
318.732	being lonely.
320.565	They were then asked again
320.565	about their religious beliefs.
323.381	Those who had been asked
323.381	to think about being dead
326.245	were afterwards twice as likely to express faith
329.818	in God and Jesus.
331.478	Twice as likely.
333.256	Even though the before they
333.256	were all equally agnostic.
335.964	But put the fear of death in them,
337.725	and they run to Jesus.
341.584	Now, this shows that reminding people of death
345.111	biases them to believe, regardless of the evidence,
348.341	and it works not just for religion,
350.366	but for any kind of belief system
352.603	that promises immortality in some form,
356.063	whether it's becoming famous
357.868	or having children
359.282	or even nationalism,
360.629	which promises you can live
360.629	on as part of a greater whole.
363.902	This is a bias that has shaped
365.833	the course of human history.
369.172	Now, the theory behind this bias
371.439	in the over 400 studies
373.176	is called terror management theory,
375.305	and the idea is simple. It's just this.
377.655	We develop our worldviews,
380.204	that is, the stories we tell ourselves
382.361	about the world and our place in it,
385.097	in order to help us manage
387.379	the terror of death.
390.293	And these immortality stories
392.092	have thousands of different manifestations,
395.089	but I believe that behind the apparent diversity
398.673	there are actually just four basic forms
401.372	that these immortality stories can take.
404.883	And we can see them repeating themselves
406.688	throughout history, just with slight variations
409.858	to reflect the vocabulary of the day.
412.623	Now I'm going to briefly introduce these four
415.131	basic forms of immortality story,
417.384	and I want to try to give you some sense
418.954	of the way in which they're retold by each culture
421.267	or generation
423.034	using the vocabulary of their day.
425.206	Now, the first story is the simplest.
427.845	We want to avoid death,
429.998	and the dream of doing that in this body
432.423	in this world forever
433.783	is the first and simplest kind of immortality story,
437.074	and it might at first sound implausible,
439.533	but actually, almost every culture in human history
443.514	has had some myth or legend
445.576	of an elixir of life or a fountain of youth
448.337	or something that promises to keep us going
451.316	forever.
454.453	Ancient Egypt had such myths,
456.046	ancient Babylon, ancient India.
458.414	Throughout European history, we find them
458.414	in the work of the alchemists,
461.266	and of course we still believe this today,
464.06	only we tell this story using the vocabulary
466.623	of science.
468.279	So 100 years ago,
469.885	hormones had just been discovered,
471.704	and people hoped that hormone treatments
473.356	were going to cure aging and disease,
476.055	and now instead we set our hopes on stem cells,
478.908	genetic engineering, and nanotechnology.
481.203	But the idea that science can cure death
485.161	is just one more chapter in the story
487.502	of the magical elixir,
489.735	a story that is as old as civilization.
494.171	But betting everything on the idea of finding the elixir
496.951	and staying alive forever
498.354	is a risky strategy.
500.155	When we look back through history
502.395	at all those who have sought an elixir in the past,
505.179	the one thing they now have in common
507.008	is that they're all dead.
509.638	So we need a backup plan,
509.638	and exactly this kind of plan B
513.376	is what the second kind of immortality story offers,
516.947	and that's resurrection.
518.702	And it stays with the idea that I am this body,
521.076	I am this physical organism.
523.051	It accepts that I'm going to have to die
525.219	but says, despite that,
526.593	I can rise up and I can live again.
529.096	In other words, I can do what Jesus did.
531.714	Jesus died, he was three days in the [tomb],
533.759	and then he rose up and lived again.
536.87	And the idea that we can all be
536.87	resurrected to live again
539.989	is orthodox believe, not just for Christians
542.277	but also Jews and Muslims.
544.98	But our desire to believe this story
547.144	is so deeply embedded
549.154	that we are reinventing it again
551.252	for the scientific age,
552.744	for example, with the idea of cryonics.
555.567	That's the idea that when you die,
557.157	you can have yourself frozen,
559.156	and then, at some point when technology
561.545	has advanced enough,
562.756	you can be thawed out and repaired and revived
564.876	and so resurrected.
566.165	And so some people believe an omnipotent god
569.013	will resurrect them to live again,
570.892	and other people believe an 
570.892	omnipotent scientist will do it.
575.035	But for others, the whole idea of resurrection,
577.749	of climbing out of the grave,
579.752	it's just too much like a bad zombie movie.
582.471	They find the body too messy, too unreliable
585.262	to guarantee eternal life,
587.41	and so they set their hopes on the third,
590.501	more spiritual immortality story,
592.618	the idea that we can leave our body behind
594.954	and live on as a soul.
597.251	Now, the majority of people on Earth
599.24	believe they have a soul,
601.013	and the idea is central to many religions.
603.423	But even though, in its current form,
605.737	in its traditional form,
607.652	the idea of the soul is still hugely popular,
609.815	nonetheless we are again
611.247	reinventing it for the digital age,
613.471	for example with the idea
614.948	that you can leave your body behind
616.938	by uploading your mind, your essence,
619.184	the real you, onto a computer,
621.14	and so live on as an avatar in the ether.
625.752	But of course there are skeptics who say
627.775	if we look at the evidence of science,
629.619	particularly neuroscience,
631.263	it suggests that your mind,
633.092	your essence, the real you,
634.672	is very much dependent on a particular part
637.085	of your body, that is, your brain.
639.306	And such skeptics can find comfort
641.827	in the fourth kind of immortality story,
644.085	and that is legacy,
646.442	the idea that you can live on
647.922	through the echo you leave in the world,
650.173	like the great Greek warrior Achilles,
652.522	who sacrificed his life fighting at Troy
655.151	so that he might win immortal fame.
658.204	And the pursuit of fame is as widespread
660.47	and popular now as it ever was,
662.611	and in our digital age,
664.19	it's even easier to achieve.
665.718	You don't need to be a great warrior like Achilles
668.042	or a great king or hero.
669.735	All you need is an Internet connection
669.735	and a funny cat. (Laughter)
674.558	But some people prefer to leave a more tangible,
677.021	biological legacy -- children, for example.
679.865	Or they like, they hope, to live on
682.141	as part of some greater whole,
683.858	a nation or a family or a tribe,
686.307	their gene pool.
688.773	But again, there are skeptics
690.286	who doubt whether legacy
691.999	really is immortality.
693.974	Woody Allen, for example, who said,
696.051	"""I don't want to live on in"
696.051	the hearts of my countrymen.
698.547	"I want to live on in my apartment."""
700.744	So those are the four
702.511	basic kinds of immortality stories,
704.694	and I've tried to give just some sense
706.336	of how they're retold by each generation
708.629	with just slight variations
710.216	to fit the fashions of the day.
712.521	And the fact that they recur in this way,
716.01	in such a similar form but
716.01	in such different belief systems,
718.998	suggests, I think,
720.576	that we should be skeptical of the truth
722.978	of any particular version of these stories.
726.739	The fact that some people believe
728.85	an omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again
731.515	and others believe an omnipotent scientist will do it
735.216	suggests that neither are really believing this
738.254	on the strength of the evidence.
740.924	Rather, we believe these stories
743.35	because we are biased to believe them,
745.333	and we are biased to believe them
747.161	because we are so afraid of death.
751.431	So the question is,
753.486	are we doomed to lead the one life we have
756.958	in a way that is shaped by fear and denial,
760.651	or can we overcome this bias?
763.726	Well the Greek philosopher Epicurus
766.193	thought we could.
767.921	He argued that the fear of death is natural,
771.469	but it is not rational.
773.884	"""Death,"" he said, ""is nothing to us,"
776.542	because when we are here, death is not,
779.392	"and when death is here, we are gone."""
783.145	Now this is often quoted, but it's difficult
784.943	to really grasp, to really internalize,
787.265	because exactly this idea of being gone
789.428	is so difficult to imagine.
791.567	So 2,000 years later, another philosopher,
793.798	Ludwig Wittgenstein, put it like this:
797.255	"""Death is not an event in life:"
800.199	We do not live to experience death.
803.841	"And so,"" he added,"
805.035	"""in this sense, life has no end."""
807.97	So it was natural for me as a child
811.146	to fear being swallowed by the void,
813.513	but it wasn't rational,
815.392	because being swallowed by the void
817.377	is not something that any of us
819.455	will ever live to experience.
822.725	Now, overcoming this bias is not easy because
825.254	the fear of death is so deeply embedded in us,
828.213	yet when we see that the fear itself is not rational,
832.695	and when we bring out into the open
834.825	the ways in which it can unconsciously bias us,
837.523	then we can at least start
839.374	to try to minimize the influence it has
842.008	on our lives.
843.891	Now, I find it helps to see life
846.709	as being like a book:
848.553	Just as a book is bounded by its covers,
851.021	by beginning and end,
852.298	so our lives are bounded by birth and death,
856.036	and even though a book is
856.036	limited by beginning and end,
859.551	it can encompass distant landscapes,
861.687	exotic figures, fantastic adventures.
864.917	And even though a book is
864.917	limited by beginning and end,
868.266	the characters within it
870.089	know no horizons.
872.931	They only know the moments
872.931	that make up their story,
876.088	even when the book is closed.
879.028	And so the characters of a book
881.164	are not afraid of reaching the last page.
884.646	Long John Silver is not afraid of you
886.924	"finishing your copy of ""Treasure Island."""
889.759	And so it should be with us.
891.459	Imagine the book of your life,
893.603	its covers, its beginning and end,
893.603	and your birth and your death.
896.387	You can only know the moments in between,
898.564	the moments that make up your life.
900.499	It makes no sense for you to fear
902.446	what is outside of those covers,
904.536	whether before your birth
906.006	or after your death.
907.982	And you needn't worry how long the book is,
910.511	or whether it's a comic strip or an epic.
913.984	The only thing that matters
915.526	is that you make it a good story.
919.024	Thank you.
921.244	(Applause)
