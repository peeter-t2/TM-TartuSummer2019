12.999	If you want to buy high-quality,
12.999	low-price cocaine,
18.542	there really is only one place to go,
21.403	and that is the dark net
21.403	anonymous markets.
25.664	Now, you can't get to these sites
27.312	with a normal browser --
27.312	Chrome or Firefox --
31.799	because they're on this
31.799	hidden part of the Internet,
34.956	known as Tor hidden services,
37.082	where URLs are a string of meaningless
37.082	numbers and letters that end in .onion,
41.799	and which you access
41.799	with a special browser
44.629	called the Tor browser.
46.799	Now, the Tor browser was originally
46.799	a U.S. Naval intelligence project.
51.399	It then became open source,
53.304	and it allows anybody to browse the net
55.915	without giving away their location.
58.955	And it does this
58.955	by encrypting your IP address
62.519	and then routing it via several
62.519	other computers around the world
66.319	that use the same software.
69.508	You can use it on the normal Internet,
71.799	but it's also your key to the dark net.
76.438	And because of this fiendishly
76.438	clever encryption system,
79.532	the 20 or 30 -- we don't know exactly --
79.532	thousand sites that operate there
84.975	are incredibly difficult to shut down.
88.642	It is a censorship-free world
88.642	visited by anonymous users.
95.268	Little wonder, then,
95.268	that it's a natural place to go
99.61	for anybody with something to hide,
101.546	and that something, of course,
101.546	need not be illegal.
106.799	On the dark net, you will find
108.662	whistle-blower sites, The New Yorker.
111.225	You will find political activism blogs.
113.735	You will find libraries of pirated books.
116.867	But you'll also find the drugs markets,
120.514	illegal pornography,
120.514	commercial hacking services,
124.643	and much more besides.
126.264	Now, the dark net is one of the most
126.264	interesting, exciting places
132.098	anywhere on the net.
133.799	And the reason is, because
133.799	although innovation, of course,
137.499	takes place in big businesses,
139.799	takes place in world-class universities,
142.222	it also takes place in the fringes,
144.799	because those on the fringes --
144.799	the pariahs, the outcasts --
149.366	they're often the most creative,
149.366	because they have to be.
153.619	In this part of the Internet,
156.076	you will not find a single lolcat,
158.379	a single pop-up advert anywhere.
161.449	And that's one of the reasons why I think
163.886	many of you here will be
163.886	on the dark net fairly soon.
167.599	(Laughter)
170.177	Not that I'm suggesting
170.177	anyone in this audience would use it
173.493	to go and procure high-quality narcotics.
176.405	But let's say for a moment that you were.
178.414	(Laughter)
180.44	Bear with me.
182.868	The first thing you will notice
182.868	on signing up to one of these sites
187.468	is how familiar it looks.
190.299	Every single product --
193.289	thousands of products --
195.177	has a glossy, high-res image,
199.217	a detailed product description, a price.
202.414	"There's a ""Proceed to checkout"" icon."
205.518	There is even, most beautifully of all,
208.3	"a ""Report this item"" button."
210.482	(Laughter)
213.213	Incredible.
215.163	You browse through the site,
215.163	you make your choice,
217.574	you pay with the crypto-currency bitcoin,
220.017	you enter an address -- 
220.017	preferably not your home address --
223.07	and you wait for your product
223.07	to arrive in the post,
225.799	which it nearly always does.
229.281	And the reason it does
229.281	is not because of the clever encryption.
233.163	That's important.
234.674	Something far simpler than that.
238.027	It's the user reviews.
239.944	(Laughter)
241.283	You see, every single vendor
241.283	on these sites
245.078	uses a pseudonym, naturally enough,
247.42	but they keep the same pseudonym
247.42	to build up a reputation.
251.61	And because it's easy for the buyer
251.61	to change allegiance whenever they want,
256.934	the only way of trusting a vendor
261.231	is if they have a good history
261.231	of positive feedback
264.893	from other users of the site.
267.396	And this introduction
267.396	of competition and choice
271.897	does exactly what
271.897	the economists would predict.
277.346	Prices tend to go down,
277.346	product quality tends to go up,
282.056	and the vendors are attentive,
284.453	they're polite, they're consumer-centric,
286.908	offering you all manner
286.908	of special deals, one-offs,
291.244	buy-one-get-one-frees, free delivery,
294.439	to keep you happy.
296.953	I spoke to Drugsheaven.
299.895	Drugsheaven was offering
299.895	excellent and consistent marijuana
305.809	at a reasonable price.
308.154	He had a very generous refund policy,
311.987	detailed T's and C's,
313.799	and good shipping times.
315.608	"""Dear Drugsheaven,"" I wrote,"
317.893	via the internal emailing system
317.893	that's also encrypted, of course.
322.397	"""I'm new here. Do you mind"
322.397	"if I buy just one gram of marijuana?"""
327.45	A couple of hours later, I get a reply.
329.598	They always reply.
331.23	"""Hi there, thanks for your email."
334.154	Starting small is a wise thing to do.
334.154	"I would, too, if I were you."""
339.446	(Laughter)
341.232	"""So no problem if you'd like to start"
341.232	with just one gram.
344.377	I do hope we can do business together.
346.912	"Best wishes, Drugsheaven."""
348.799	(Laughter)
350.799	I don't know why he had a posh
350.799	English accent, but I assume he did.
356.279	Now, this kind
356.279	of consumer-centric attitude
360.799	is the reason why, when I reviewed
366.259	that had been left on one of these sites
366.259	over a three-month period,
374.563	The customer, you see, is king.
377.799	But what does that mean?
379.033	Well, on the one hand,
380.998	that means there are more drugs,
380.998	more available, more easily,
385.056	to more people.
386.799	And by my reckoning,
386.799	that is not a good thing.
390.799	But, on the other hand,
390.799	if you are going to take drugs,
394.536	you have a reasonably good way
397.621	of guaranteeing a certain level
397.621	of purity and quality,
402.059	which is incredibly important
402.059	if you're taking drugs.
405.799	And you can do so
405.799	from the comfort of your own home,
408.941	without the risks associated
408.941	with buying on the streets.
413.961	Now, as I said,
415.461	you've got to be creative and innovative
415.461	to survive in this marketplace.
420.277	And the 20 or so sites
420.277	that are currently in operation --
423.395	by the way, they don't always work,
423.395	they're not always perfect;
427.124	the site that I showed you
427.124	was shut down 18 months ago,
429.75	but not before it had turned
429.75	over a billion dollars' worth of trade.
437.47	But these markets,
438.647	because of the difficult conditions
438.647	in which they are operating,
441.733	the inhospitable conditions,
443.245	are always innovating, always
443.245	thinking of ways of getting smarter,
446.617	more decentralized, harder to censor,
448.879	and more customer-friendly.
452.346	Let's take the payment system.
454.383	You don't pay with your credit card,
456.205	of course -- that would lead
456.205	directly back to you.
458.574	So you use the crypto-currency bitcoin,
460.575	which is easily exchanged
460.575	for real-world currencies
465.054	and gives quite a high degree
465.054	of anonymity to its users.
469.367	But at the beginning of these sites,
469.367	people noticed a flaw.
472.318	Some of the unscrupulous dealers
472.318	were running away with peoples' bitcoin
476.407	before they'd mailed the drugs out.
479.155	The community came up with a solution,
479.155	called multi-signature escrow payments.
487.135	So on purchasing my item,
490.652	I would send my bitcoin
493.702	to a neutral, secure third digital wallet.
498.799	The vendor, who would see
498.799	that I'd sent it,
501.412	would be confident that they
501.412	could then send the product to me,
504.392	and then when I received it,
505.799	at least two of the three people
505.799	engaged in the transaction --
508.799	vendor, buyer, site administrator --
511.363	would have to sign the transaction off
513.799	with a unique digital signature,
515.901	and then the money would be transferred.
518.263	Brilliant!
519.587	Elegant.
520.762	It works.
522.877	But then they realized there was
522.877	a problem with bitcoin,
525.552	because every bitcoin transaction
527.277	is actually recorded publicly
527.277	in a public ledger.
529.799	So if you're clever, you can try
529.799	and work out who's behind them.
533.1	So they came up with a tumbling service.
536.409	Hundreds of people send
536.409	their bitcoin into one address,
539.824	they're tumbled and jumbled up,
541.823	and then the right amount
541.823	is sent on to the right recipients,
545.637	but they're different bitcoins:
547.483	micro-laundering systems.
549.197	(Laughter)
550.755	It's incredible.
551.935	Interested in what drugs are trending
551.935	right now on the dark net markets?
557.152	Check Grams, the search engine.
559.253	You can even buy some advertising space.
561.442	(Laughter)
563.531	Are you an ethical consumer worried
563.531	about what the drugs industry is doing?
569.064	Yeah.
570.592	One vendor will offer you
570.592	fair trade organic cocaine.
574.01	(Laughter)
575.176	That's not being sourced
575.176	from Colombian druglords,
578.495	but Guatemalan farmers.
579.948	They even promised to reinvest
583.284	into local education programs.
585.098	(Laughter)
586.144	There's even a mystery shopper.
588.936	Now, whatever you think
588.936	about the morality of these sites --
592.344	and I submit that it's not
592.344	actually an easy question --
595.683	the creation of functioning,
595.683	competitive, anonymous markets,
601.209	where nobody knows who anybody else is,
603.799	constantly at risk of being shut down
603.799	by the authorities,
606.922	is a staggering achievement,
609.48	a phenomenal achievement.
612.579	And it's that kind of innovation
616.017	that's why those on the fringes
618.799	are often the harbingers
618.799	of what is to come.
622.36	It's easy to forget
624.488	that because of its short life,
626.574	the Internet has actually
626.574	changed many times
630.245	over the last 30 years or so.
631.799	It started in the '70s
631.799	as a military project,
634.799	morphed in the 1980s
634.799	to an academic network,
638.799	co-opted by commercial
638.799	companies in the '90s,
641.285	and then invaded by all of us
641.285	via social media in the noughties,
644.764	but I think it's going to change again.
647.179	And I think things
647.179	like the dark net markets --
649.799	creative, secure, difficult to censor --
653.799	I think that's the future.
656.929	And the reason it's the future
658.581	is because we're all worried
658.581	about our privacy.
661.273	Surveys consistently show
661.273	concerns about privacy.
664.522	The more time we spend online,
664.522	the more we worry about them,
668.505	and those surveys show
668.505	our worries are growing.
670.799	We're worried about
670.799	what happens to our data.
672.939	We're worried about
672.939	who might be watching us.
675.072	Since the revelations from Edward Snowden,
677.664	there's been a huge increase
677.664	in the number of people
680.134	using various privacy-enhancing tools.
683.25	There are now between two
683.25	and three million daily users
686.511	of the Tor browser,
687.81	the majority of which use
687.81	is perfectly legitimate,
693.001	sometimes even mundane.
695.658	And there are hundreds of activists
695.658	around the world
698.833	working on techniques and tools
698.833	to keep you private online --
705.111	default encrypted messaging services.
707.616	Ethereum, which is a project
707.616	which tries to link up
711.663	the connected but unused hard drives
711.663	of millions of computers around the world,
716.765	to create a sort of distributed Internet
716.765	that no one really controls.
720.66	Now, we've had distributed
720.66	computing before, of course.
723.577	We use it for everything from Skype
723.577	to the search for extraterrestrial life.
727.799	But you add distributed computing
727.799	and powerful encryption --
732.312	that's very, very hard
732.312	to censor and control.
736.625	Another called MaidSafe
736.625	works on similar principles.
739.462	Another called Twister,
739.462	and so on and so on.
743.396	And here's the thing --
745.41	the more of us join,
746.898	the more interesting those sites become,
749.373	and then the more of us join, and so on.
752.268	And I think that's what's going to happen.
754.317	In fact, it's already happening.
756.489	The dark net is no longer
756.489	a den for dealers
760.389	and a hideout for whistle-blowers.
762.98	It's already going mainstream.
765.698	Just recently, the musician Aphex Twin
765.698	released his album as a dark net site.
772.296	Facebook has started a dark net site.
776.273	A group of London architects
776.273	have opened a dark net site
779.93	for people worried
779.93	about regeneration projects.
782.799	Yes, the dark net is going mainstream,
785.396	and I predict that fairly soon,
785.396	every social media company,
789.037	every major news outlet,
790.496	and therefore most of you
790.496	in this audience,
793.604	will be using the dark net, too.
796.942	So the Internet is about to get
796.942	more interesting,
799.995	more exciting, more innovative,
802.799	more terrible,
804.548	more destructive.
807.14	That's good news
807.14	if you care about liberty.
809.437	It's good news if you care about freedom.
811.431	It's good news if you care
811.431	about democracy.
813.574	It's also good news
814.976	if you want to browse
814.976	for illegal pornography
817.446	and if you want to buy and sell drugs
819.799	with impunity.
821.876	Neither entirely dark, nor entirely light.
825.799	It's not one side or the other
825.799	that's going to win out, but both.
830.352	Thank you very much, indeed.
832.24	(Applause)
