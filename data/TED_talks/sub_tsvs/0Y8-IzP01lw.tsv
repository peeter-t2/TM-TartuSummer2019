15.393	Science,
16.621	science has allowed us to know so much
19.958	about the far reaches of the universe,
22.984	which is at the same time tremendously important
26.179	and extremely remote,
28.245	and yet much, much closer,
30.704	much more directly related to us,
32.795	there are many things we don't really understand.
35.263	And one of them is the extraordinary
37.392	social complexity of the animals around us,
40.718	and today I want to tell you a few stories
42.734	of animal complexity.
44.742	But first, what do we call complexity?
48.092	What is complex?
49.579	Well, complex is not complicated.
53.006	Something complicated comprises many small parts,
56.454	all different, and each of them
58.899	has its own precise role in the machinery.
62.003	On the opposite, a complex system
64.814	is made of many, many similar parts,
67.455	and it is their interaction
69.463	that produces a globally coherent behavior.
72.783	Complex systems have many interacting parts
76.619	which behave according to simple, individual rules,
80.045	and this results in emergent properties.
83.394	The behavior of the system as a whole
85.282	cannot be predicted
86.95	from the individual rules only.
89.102	As Aristotle wrote,
90.912	the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
93.972	But from Aristotle, let's move onto
96.434	a more concrete example of complex systems.
100.124	These are Scottish terriers.
102.08	In the beginning, the system is disorganized.
105.831	Then comes a perturbation: milk.
109.632	Every individual starts pushing in one direction
113.482	and this is what happens.
116.791	The pinwheel is an emergent property
119.617	of the interactions between puppies
121.52	whose only rule is to try to keep access to the milk
125.43	and therefore to push in a random direction.
129.037	So it's all about finding the simple rules
133.012	from which complexity emerges.
135.77	I call this simplifying complexity,
138.71	and it's what we do at the chair of systems design
140.845	at ETH Zurich.
142.822	We collect data on animal populations,
146.527	analyze complex patterns, try to explain them.
150.338	It requires physicists who work with biologists,
152.957	with mathematicians and computer scientists,
155.68	and it is their interaction that produces
158.5	cross-boundary competence
160.214	to solve these problems.
161.792	So again, the whole is greater
164.064	than the sum of the parts.
165.464	In a way, collaboration
167.614	is another example of a complex system.
171.105	And you may be asking yourself
172.981	which side I'm on, biology or physics?
175.798	In fact, it's a little different,
177.909	and to explain, I need to tell you
179.498	a short story about myself.
181.84	When I was a child,
183.567	I loved to build stuff, to
183.567	create complicated machines.
187.676	So I set out to study electrical engineering
190.413	and robotics,
191.965	and my end-of-studies project
194.058	was about building a robot called ER-1 --
196.984	it looked like thisâ€”
198.914	that would collect information from its environment
201.285	and proceed to follow a white line on the ground.
204.783	It was very, very complicated,
207.162	but it worked beautifully in our test room,
210.146	and on demo day, professors had 
210.146	assembled to grade the project.
213.607	So we took ER-1 to the evaluation room.
216.509	It turned out, the light in that room
218.819	was slightly different.
220.638	The robot's vision system got confused.
222.969	At the first bend in the line,
224.73	it left its course, and crashed into a wall.
228.469	We had spent weeks building it,
230.556	and all it took to destroy it
232.229	was a subtle change in the color of the light
234.885	in the room.
236.481	That's when I realized that
237.996	the more complicated you make a machine,
240.323	the more likely that it will fail
242.362	due to something absolutely unexpected.
244.925	And I decided that, in fact,
246.755	I didn't really want to create complicated stuff.
249.768	I wanted to understand complexity,
252.71	the complexity of the world around us
254.698	and especially in the animal kingdom.
257.103	Which brings us to bats.
260.423	Bechstein's bats are a common
260.423	species of European bats.
263.474	They are very social animals.
264.887	Mostly they roost, or sleep, together.
268.178	And they live in maternity colonies,
269.857	which means that every spring,
271.397	the females meet after the winter hibernation,
274.655	and they stay together for about six months
276.744	to rear their young,
279.23	and they all carry a very small chip,
282.035	which means that every time one of them
283.906	enters one of these specially equipped bat boxes,
286.963	we know where she is,
288.606	and more importantly,
289.775	we know with whom she is.
292.338	So I study roosting associations in bats,
296.032	and this is what it looks like.
298.477	During the day, the bats roost
300.919	in a number of sub-groups in different boxes.
303.223	It could be that on one day,
305.152	the colony is split between two boxes,
307.372	but on another day,
308.672	it could be together in a single box,
310.913	or split between three or more boxes,
313.229	and that all seems rather erratic, really.
316.156	It's called fission-fusion dynamics,
319.359	the property for an animal group
321.072	of regularly splitting and merging
323.25	into different subgroups.
324.911	So what we do is take all these data
327.473	from all these different days
329.135	and pool them together
330.639	to extract a long-term association pattern
333.256	by applying techniques with network analysis
335.761	to get a complete picture
337.382	of the social structure of the colony.
339.919	Okay? So that's what this picture looks like.
344.184	In this network, all the circles
346.578	are nodes, individual bats,
349.355	and the lines between them
350.938	are social bonds, associations between individuals.
354.602	It turns out this is a very interesting picture.
357.28	This bat colony is organized
359.262	in two different communities
361.13	which cannot be predicted
362.969	from the daily fission-fusion dynamics.
365.218	We call them cryptic social units.
368.768	Even more interesting, in fact:
370.384	Every year, around October,
372.748	the colony splits up,
374.309	and all bats hibernate separately,
377.007	but year after year,
378.468	when the bats come together again in the spring,
381.541	the communities stay the same.
384.131	So these bats remember their friends
386.851	for a really long time.
388.681	With a brain the size of a peanut,
391.155	they maintain individualized,
393.28	long-term social bonds,
395.422	We didn't know that was possible.
397.146	We knew that primates
398.905	and elephants and dolphins could do that,
401.473	but compared to bats, they have huge brains.
404.101	So how could it be
406.5	that the bats maintain this complex,
408.451	stable social structure
410.139	with such limited cognitive abilities?
413.671	And this is where complexity brings an answer.
416.56	To understand this system,
418.701	we built a computer model of roosting,
421.498	based on simple, individual rules,
423.516	and simulated thousands and thousands of days
425.951	in the virtual bat colony.
427.97	It's a mathematical model,
430.094	but it's not complicated.
432.048	What the model told us is that, in a nutshell,
435.146	each bat knows a few other colony members
438.332	as her friends, and is just slightly more likely
440.82	to roost in a box with them.
443.33	Simple, individual rules.
445.774	This is all it takes to explain
447.486	the social complexity of these bats.
449.875	But it gets better.
451.593	Between 2010 and 2011,
454.441	the colony lost more than two thirds of its members,
457.894	probably due to the very cold winter.
460.88	The next spring, it didn't form two communities
464.024	like every year,
465.295	which may have led the whole colony to die
467.498	because it had become too small.
469.593	Instead, it formed a single, cohesive social unit,
474.966	which allowed the colony to survive that season
477.698	and thrive again in the next two years.
480.802	What we know is that the bats
482.58	are not aware that their colony is doing this.
485.487	All they do is follow simple association rules,
489.033	and from this simplicity
490.382	emerges social complexity
492.823	which allows the colony to be resilient
495.663	against dramatic changes
495.663	in the population structure.
498.644	And I find this incredible.
501.338	Now I want to tell you another story,
503.422	but for this we have to travel from Europe
504.977	to the Kalahari Desert in South Africa.
508.025	This is where meerkats live.
510.052	I'm sure you know meerkats.
511.552	They're fascinating creatures.
513.658	They live in groups with a
513.658	very strict social hierarchy.
516.647	There is one dominant pair,
518.106	and many subordinates,
519.488	some acting as sentinels,
521.202	some acting as babysitters,
522.539	some teaching pups, and so on.
524.436	What we do is put very small GPS collars
527.757	on these animals
529.282	to study how they move together,
531.157	and what this has to do with their social structure.
534.874	And there's a very interesting example
536.364	of collective movement in meerkats.
539.08	In the middle of the reserve which they live in
541.447	lies a road.
542.656	On this road there are cars, so it's dangerous.
545.889	But the meerkats have to cross it
548.173	to get from one feeding place to another.
550.747	So we asked, how exactly do they do this?
555.498	We found that the dominant female
557.334	is mostly the one who leads the group to the road,
559.955	but when it comes to crossing it, crossing the road,
563.227	she gives way to the subordinates,
565.578	a manner of saying,
567.355	"""Go ahead, tell me if it's safe."""
570.037	What I didn't know, in fact,
571.701	was what rules in their behavior the meerkats follow
574.843	for this change at the edge of the group to happen
577.768	and if simple rules were sufficient to explain it.
581.618	So I built a model, a model of simulated meerkats
585.609	crossing a simulated road.
587.522	It's a simplistic model.
589.394	Moving meerkats are like random particles
592.234	whose unique rule is one of alignment.
594.456	They simply move together.
596.862	When these particles get to the road,
600.046	they sense some kind of obstacle,
601.988	and they bounce against it.
604.072	The only difference
605.228	between the dominant female, here in red,
607.27	and the other individuals,
608.755	is that for her, the height of the obstacle,
611.309	which is in fact the risk perceived from the road,
613.814	is just slightly higher,
615.763	and this tiny difference
617.424	in the individual's rule of movement
619.262	is sufficient to explain what we observe,
621.708	that the dominant female
624.268	leads her group to the road
625.702	and then gives way to the others
627.372	for them to cross first.
630.235	George Box, who was an English statistician,
633.886	"once wrote, ""All models are false,"
636.848	"but some models are useful."""
638.907	And in fact, this model is obviously false,
642.104	because in reality, meerkats are
642.104	anything but random particles.
646.072	But it's also useful,
647.709	because it tells us that extreme simplicity
650.458	in movement rules at the individual level
653.816	can result in a great deal of complexity
656.167	at the level of the group.
658.105	So again, that's simplifying complexity.
662.161	I would like to conclude
663.609	on what this means for the whole species.
666.426	When the dominant female
668.09	gives way to a subordinate,
669.656	it's not out of courtesy.
671.773	In fact, the dominant female
673.28	is extremely important for the cohesion of the group.
675.799	If she dies on the road, the whole group is at risk.
679.311	So this behavior of risk avoidance
681.547	is a very old evolutionary response.
684.348	These meerkats are replicating an evolved tactic
688.217	that is thousands of generations old,
690.45	and they're adapting it to a modern risk,
692.864	in this case a road built by humans.
696.189	They adapt very simple rules,
698.584	and the resulting complex behavior
700.873	allows them to resist human encroachment
703.829	into their natural habitat.
706.277	In the end,
708.079	it may be bats which change their social structure
710.779	in response to a population crash,
713.163	or it may be meerkats
714.562	who show a novel adaptation to a human road,
717.764	or it may be another species.
720.449	My message here -- and it's not a complicated one,
723.242	but a simple one of wonder and hope --
726.006	my message here is that animals
729.099	show extraordinary social complexity,
731.523	and this allows them to adapt
733.964	and respond to changes in their environment.
737.445	In three words, in the animal kingdom,
740.213	simplicity leads to complexity
742.987	which leads to resilience.
744.47	Thank you.
746.754	(Applause)
762.694	Dania Gerhardt: Thank you very much, Nicolas,
764.647	for this great start. Little bit nervous?
767.926	Nicolas Perony: I'm okay, thanks.
769.57	DG: Okay, great. I'm sure a 
769.57	lot of people in the audience
772.03	somehow tried to make associations
773.894	between the animals you were talking about --
775.718	the bats, meerkats -- and humans.
777.774	You brought some examples:
778.982	The females are the social ones,
780.717	the females are the dominant ones,
782.43	I'm not sure who thinks how.
784.103	But is it okay to do these associations?
786.998	Are there stereotypes you can confirm in this regard
789.798	that can be valid across all species?
793.071	NP: Well, I would say there are also
794.674	counter-examples to these stereotypes.
796.626	For examples, in sea horses or in koalas, in fact,
799.766	it is the males who take care of the young always.
803.464	And the lesson is that it's often difficult,
808.505	and sometimes even a bit dangerous,
810.257	to draw parallels between humans and animals.
812.929	So that's it.
815.035	DG: Okay. Thank you very much for this great start.
817.881	Thank you, Nicolas Perony.
