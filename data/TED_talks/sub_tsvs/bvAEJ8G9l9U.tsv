12.24	Wow, what an honor. I always wondered
12.24	what this would feel like.
15.28	So eight years ago,
15.28	I got the worst career advice of my life.
20.08	I had a friend tell me,
21.56	"""Don't worry about how much"
21.56	you like the work you're doing now.
24.52	"It's all about just building your resume."""
26.56	And I'd just come back
26.56	from living in Spain for a while,
29.24	and I'd joined this Fortune 500 company.
29.24	"I thought, ""This is fantastic."
32.598	I'm going to have
32.598	"big impact on the world."""
34.638	I had all these ideas.
34.638	And within about two months,
37.36	I noticed at about 10am every morning
37.36	I had this strange urge
40.384	to want to slam my head
40.384	through the monitor of my computer.
43.96	I don't know if anyone's ever felt that.
45.889	And I noticed pretty soon after that
45.889	that all the competitors in our space
49.44	had already automated my job role.
52.36	And this is right about when I got
52.36	this sage advice to build up my resume.
56.6	Well, as I'm trying to figure out
58.64	what two-story window I'm going
58.64	to jump out of and change things up,
65.16	I read some altogether different advice
65.16	from Warren Buffett, and he said,
68.92	"""Taking jobs to build up your resume"
68.92	"is the same as saving up sex for old age."""
74.56	(Laughter)
76.319	And I heard that,
76.319	and that was all I needed.
78.64	Within two weeks, I was out of there,
78.64	and I left with one intention:
81.88	to find something that I could screw up.
81.88	That's how tough it was.
84.96	I wanted to have some type of impact.
84.96	It didn't matter what it was.
88	And I found pretty quickly
88	that I wasn't alone:
90.739	it turns out that over 80 percent
90.739	of the people around
93.6	don't enjoy their work.
95.12	I'm guessing this room is different,
96.68	but that's the average
96.68	that Deloitte has done with their studies.
99.56	So I wanted to find out,
99.56	what is it that sets these people apart,
102.632	the people who do the passionate,
102.632	world-changing work,
104.992	that wake up inspired every day,
106.64	and then these people,
106.64	the other 80 percent
108.44	who lead these lives of quiet desperation.
110.52	So I started to interview all these people
110.52	doing this inspiring work,
113.8	and I read books and did case studies,
	on purpose and career and all this,
119.36	totally just self-immersion,
119.36	really for the selfish reason of --
124.24	I wanted to find the work
124.24	that I couldn't not do,
126.76	what that was for me.
128.32	But as I was doing this,
128.32	more and more people started to ask me,
130.986	"""You're into this career thing."
132.48	I don't like my job.
132.48	"Can we sit down for lunch?"""
134.72	"I'd say, ""Sure."""
134.72	But I would have to warn them,
136.92	because at this point,
136.92	my quit rate was also 80 percent.
139.24	Of the people I'd sit down with for lunch,
142.491	within two months.
143.68	I was proud of this, and it wasn't
143.68	that I had any special magic.
147.92	It was that I would ask
147.92	one simple question.
149.992	"It was, ""Why are you doing"
149.992	"the work that you're doing?"""
152.632	And so often their answer would be,
154.76	"""Well, because somebody"
154.76	"told me I'm supposed to."""
157.08	And I realized that so many
157.08	people around us
159.24	are climbing their way up this ladder
159.24	that someone tells them to climb,
162.88	and it ends up being leaned up
162.88	against the wrong wall,
165.44	or no wall at all.
167.12	The more time I spent around
167.12	these people and saw this problem,
169.84	I thought, what if we could
169.84	create a community,
172.08	a place where people
172.08	could feel like they belonged
174.48	and that it was OK
174.48	to do things differently,
176.647	to take the road less traveled,
176.647	where that was encouraged,
179.386	and inspire people to change?
181.96	And that later became
181.96	what I now call Live Your Legend,
184.68	which I'll explain in a little bit.
186.371	But as I've made these discoveries,
186.371	I noticed a framework
190.08	of really three simple things
191.485	that all these different passionate
191.485	world-changers have in common,
194.64	whether you're a Steve Jobs
194.64	or if you're just, you know,
197.32	the person that has
197.32	the bakery down the street.
199.4	But you're doing work
199.4	that embodies who you are.
201.44	I want to share those three with you,
201.44	so we can use them as a lens
204.36	for the rest of today
204.36	and hopefully the rest of our life.
207.051	The first part of this three-step
207.051	passionate work framework
209.851	is becoming a self-expert
209.851	and understanding yourself,
212.8	because if you don't know
212.8	what you're looking for,
215.48	you're never going to find it.
217.12	And the thing is that no one
217.12	is going to do this for us.
219.764	There's no major in university
219.764	on passion and purpose and career.
223.48	I don't know how that's not
223.48	a required double major,
225.76	but don't even get me started on that.
227.6	I mean, you spend more time
227.6	picking out a dorm room TV set
230.6	than you do you picking your major
230.6	and your area of study.
233.56	But the point is,
233.56	it's on us to figure that out,
236.2	and we need a framework,
236.2	we need a way to navigate through this.
239.44	And so the first step of our compass is
239.44	finding out what our unique strengths are.
243.322	What are the things that we wake up
243.322	loving to do no matter what,
246.36	whether we're paid or we're not paid,
246.36	the things that people thank us for?
249.88	And the Strengths Finder 2.0
249.88	is a book and also an online tool.
252.88	I highly recommend it for sorting out
252.88	what it is that you're naturally good at.
256.64	And next, what's our framework
256.64	or our hierarchy for making decisions?
261.08	Do we care about the people,
261.08	our family, health,
265.32	or is it achievement, success,
265.32	all this stuff?
267.48	We have to figure out what it is
267.48	to make these decisions,
270.171	so we know what our soul is made of,
271.92	so that we don't go selling it
271.92	to some cause we don't give a shit about.
276.64	And then the next step is our experiences.
280.36	All of us have these experiences.
280.36	We learn things every day, every minute
283.84	about what we love, what we hate,
285.56	what we're good at,
285.56	what we're terrible at.
287.584	And if we don't spend time
287.584	paying attention to that
290	and assimilating that learning
291.56	and applying it to the rest of our lives,
291.56	it's all for nothing.
294.56	Every day, every week,
294.56	every month of every year
297.24	I spend some time
297.24	just reflecting on what went right,
299.72	what went wrong,
299.72	and what do I want to repeat,
301.887	what can I apply more to my life.
303.487	And even more so than that,
303.487	as you see people, especially today,
306.6	who inspire you, who are doing
306.6	things where you say
309.005	"""Oh God, what Jeff is doing,"
309.005	"I want to be like him."""
311.96	Why are you saying that?
311.96	Open up a journal.
313.706	Write down what it is about them
313.706	that inspires you.
315.8	It's not going to be
315.8	everything about their life,
317.88	but whatever it is, take note on that,
319.72	so over time we'll have
319.72	this repository of things
322.04	that we can use to apply to our life
322.04	and have a more passionate existence
326.28	and make a better impact.
327.8	Because when we start
327.8	to put these things together,
330.205	we can then define
330.205	what success actually means to us,
333.52	and without these different parts
333.52	of the compass, it's impossible.
336.68	We end up in the situation --
336.68	we have that scripted life
339.324	that everybody seems to be living
339.324	going up this ladder to nowhere.
342.48	It's kind of like in Wall Street 2,
342.48	if anybody saw that,
345.16	the peon employee asks
345.16	the big Wall Street banker CEO,
349	"""What's your number?"
349	Everyone's got a number,
351.16	where if they make this money,
351.16	"they'll leave it all."""
353.72	"He says, ""Oh, it's simple. More."""
357.12	And he just smiles.
358.44	And it's the sad state
358.44	of most of the people
360.24	that haven't spent time
360.24	understanding what matters for them,
362.8	who keep reaching for something
362.8	that doesn't mean anything to us,
365.56	but we're doing it because everyone
365.56	said we're supposed to.
368.08	But once we have this framework together,
369.84	we can start to identify
369.84	the things that make us come alive.
372.48	You know, before this, a passion
372.48	could come and hit you in the face,
375.72	or maybe in your possible line of work,
375.72	you might throw it away
378.44	because you don't have
378.44	a way of identifying it.
380.655	But once you do, you can see something
380.655	that's congruent with my strengths,
384.215	my values, who I am as a person,
386.04	so I'm going to grab ahold of this,
386.04	I'm going to do something with it,
389.35	and I'm going to pursue it
389.35	and try to make an impact with it.
392.232	And Live Your Legend
392.232	and the movement we've built
394.8	wouldn't exist if I didn't have
394.8	this compass to identify,
397.491	"""Wow, this is something I want to pursue"
397.491	"and make a difference with."""
400.76	If we don't know what we're looking for,
400.76	we're never going to find it,
403.84	but once we have
403.84	this framework, this compass,
406.4	then we can move on to what's next --
406.4	and that's not me up there --
410.88	doing the impossible
410.88	and pushing our limits.
413.12	There's two reasons
413.12	why people don't do things.
415.16	One is they tell themselves
415.16	they can't do them,
417.16	or people around them
417.16	tell them they can't do them.
419.32	Either way, we start to believe it.
420.88	Either we give up,
420.88	or we never start in the first place.
423.28	The things is, everyone was impossible
423.28	until somebody did it.
426.2	Every invention,
426.2	every new thing in the world,
428.76	people thought were crazy at first.
430.451	Roger Bannister and the four-minute mile,
430.451	it was a physical impossibility
433.904	to break the four-minute mile
433.904	in a foot race
436.32	until Roger Bannister stood up and did it.
438.36	And then what happened?
439.6	Two months later,
442.24	The things that we have in our head
442.24	that we think are impossible
445	are often just milestones
445	waiting to be accomplished
447.16	if we can push those limits a bit.
448.804	And I think this starts with probably
448.804	your physical body and fitness
452.2	more than anything,
452.2	because we can control that.
454.76	If you don't think you can run a mile,
456.4	you show yourself
456.4	you can run a mile or two,
458.48	or a marathon, or lose five pounds,
458.48	or whatever it is,
461.04	you realize that confidence compounds
463.56	and can be transferred
463.56	into the rest of your world.
466.08	And I've actually gotten into the habit
466.08	of this a little bit with my friends.
469.76	We have this little group.
469.76	We go on physical adventures,
472.52	and recently, I found myself
472.52	in a kind of precarious spot.
475.64	I'm terrified of deep, dark, blue water.
478.68	I don't know if anyone's ever had
478.68	that same fear
480.72	ever since they watched
480.72	Jaws 1, 2, 3 and 4 like six times
483.344	when I was a kid.
484.52	But anything above here, if it's murky,
484.52	I can already feel it right now.
489.08	I swear there's something in there.
490.88	Even if it's Lake Tahoe,
490.88	it's fresh water, totally unfounded fear,
494.04	ridiculous, but it's there.
495.72	Anyway, three years ago
495.72	I find myself on this tugboat
498.24	right down here in the San Francisco Bay.
500.24	It's a rainy, stormy, windy day,
500.24	and people are getting sick on the boat,
503.72	and I'm sitting there wearing a wetsuit,
503.72	and I'm looking out the window
507.078	in pure terror thinking
507.078	I'm about to swim to my death.
510.08	I'm going to try to swim
510.08	across the Golden Gate.
512.36	And my guess is some people in this room
512.36	might have done that before.
516.2	I'm sitting there, and my buddy Jonathan,
516.2	who had talked me into it,
519.44	he comes up to me
519.44	and he could see the state I was in.
521.72	"And he says, ""Scott, hey man,"
521.72	what's the worst that could happen?
524.48	You're wearing a wetsuit.
524.48	You're not going to sink.
526.64	And If you can't make it,
526.64	just hop on one of the 20 kayaks.
529.48	Plus, if there's a shark attack,
529.48	why are they going to pick you
532.32	"over the 80 people in the water?"""
532.32	So thanks, that helps.
534.964	"He's like, ""But really,"
534.964	"just have fun with this. Good luck."""
537.844	And he dives in, swims off. OK.
540.36	Turns out, the pep talk totally worked,
540.36	and I felt this total feeling of calm,
544.76	and I think it was because
544.76	Jonathan was 13 years old.
547.72	(Laughter)
549.68	And of the 80 people swimming that day,
	the ages of nine and 13.
555.24	Think how you would have approached
555.24	your world differently
558	if at nine years old you found out
558	you could swim a mile and a half
561.2	in 56-degree water
561.2	from Alcatraz to San Francisco.
563.92	What would you have said yes to?
565.36	What would you have not given up on?
565.36	What would you have tried?
568.24	As I'm finishing this swim,
568.24	I get to Aquatic Park,
570.36	and I'm getting out of the water
571.76	and of course half the kids
571.76	are already finished,
573.88	so they're cheering me on
573.88	and they're all excited.
576.238	And I got total popsicle head,
576.238	if anyone's ever swam in the Bay,
579.278	and I'm trying to just thaw my face out,
579.278	and I'm watching people finish.
582.81	And I see this one kid,
582.81	something didn't look right.
585.84	And he's just flailing like this.
587.88	And he's barely able to sip some air
587.88	before he slams his head back down.
591.32	And I notice other parents
591.32	were watching too,
593.56	and I swear they were thinking
593.56	the same thing I was:
596.04	this is why you don't let nine-year-olds
596.04	swim from Alcatraz.
600	This was not fatigue.
601.24	All of a sudden, two parents
601.24	run up and grab him,
603.56	and they put him on their shoulders,
603.56	and they're dragging him like this,
607.36	totally limp.
609.24	And then all of a sudden
609.24	they walk a few more feet
611.6	and they plop him down in his wheelchair.
613.6	And he puts his fists up in the most
613.6	insane show of victory I've ever seen.
617.16	I can still feel the warmth
617.16	and the energy on this guy
619.84	when he made this accomplishment.
621.44	I had seen him earlier that day
621.44	in his wheelchair.
624.44	I just had no idea he was going to swim.
626.44	I mean, where is he
626.44	going to be in 20 years?
629.56	How many people told him he couldn't
629.56	do that, that he would die if tried that?
633	You prove people wrong,
633	you prove yourself wrong,
635.16	that you can make
635.16	little incremental pushes
637	of what you believe is possible.
638.56	You don't have to be
638.56	the fastest marathoner in the world,
641	just your own impossibilities,
641	to accomplish those,
643.405	and it starts with little bitty steps.
645.405	And the best way to do this
647.76	is to surround yourself
647.76	with passionate people.
650	The fastest things to do things
650	you don't think can be done
652.786	is to surround yourself
652.786	with people already doing them.
655.382	There's this quote by Jim Rohn and it says.
657.84	"""You are the average of the five people"
657.84	"you spend the most time with."""
661.24	And there is no bigger lifehack
661.24	in the history of the world
664.56	from getting where you are today
664.56	to where you want to be
667.64	than the people you choose
667.64	to put in your corner.
670.56	They change everything,
670.56	and it's a proven fact.
672.88	In 1898, Norman Triplett did this study
672.88	with a bunch of cyclists,
677.2	and he would measure their times
677.2	around the track in a group,
680.025	and also individually.
681.2	And he found that every time the cyclists
681.2	in the group would cycle faster.
684.92	And it's been repeated
684.92	in all kinds of walks of life since then,
687.76	and it proves the same thing over again,
689.68	that the people around you matter,
689.68	and environment is everything.
692.56	But it's on you to control it,
692.56	because it can go both ways.
695.16	With 80 percent of people
695.16	who don't like the work they do,
697.76	that means most people around us,
697.76	not in this room, but everywhere else,
700.96	are encouraging complacency and keeping us
700.96	from pursuing the things that matter to us
704.64	so we have to manage those surroundings.
706.72	I found myself in this situation --
710.68	personal example, a couple years ago.
713.6	Has anyone ever had a hobby or a passion
713.6	they poured their heart and soul into,
717.8	unbelievable amount of time, and they
717.8	so badly want to call it a business,
721.32	but no one's paying attention
721.32	and it doesn't make a dime?
725.48	OK, I was there for four years trying
725.48	to build this Live Your Legend movement
729.6	to help people do work that they genuinely
729.6	cared about and that inspired them,
732.96	and I was doing all I could,
734.32	and there were only
734.32	three people paying attention,
736.52	and they're all right there:
736.52	my mother, father and my wife, Chelsea.
739.783	Thank you guys for the support.
741.303	(Applause)
742.8	And this is how badly I wanted it,
742.8	it grew at zero percent for four years,
747.52	and I was about to shut it down,
749.52	and right about then,
751.24	I moved to San Francisco and started
751.24	to meet some pretty interesting people
754.8	who had these crazy
754.8	lifestyles of adventure,
757.04	of businesses and websites and blogs
759.08	that surrounded their passions
759.08	and helped people in a meaningful way.
762.36	And one of my friends,
762.36	now, he has a family of eight,
765.04	and he supports his whole family
767.4	with a blog that he
767.4	writes for twice a week.
770.28	They just came back from a month
770.28	in Europe, all of them together.
773.352	This blew my mind.
773.352	How does this even exist?
775.44	And I got unbelievably inspired
775.44	by seeing this,
778.96	and instead of shutting it down,
778.96	I decided, let's take it seriously.
781.96	And I did everything I could
781.96	to spend my time,
783.96	every waking hour possible
783.96	trying to hound these guys,
786.48	hanging out and having beers
786.48	and workouts, whatever it was.
789.28	And after four years of zero growth,
791.04	within six months
791.04	of hanging around these people,
793.4	the community at Live Your Legend
793.4	grew by 10 times.
796.12	In another 12 months,
796.12	it grew by 160 times.
800	And today over 30,000 people
800	from 158 countries
803.08	use our career and connection tools
803.08	on a monthly basis.
806.2	And those people have made up
806.2	that community of passionate folks
810.6	who inspired that possibility
810.6	that I dreamed of
812.84	for Live Your Legend so many years back.
816.04	The people change everything,
816.04	and this is why --
818.32	you know, you ask what was going on.
820.56	Well, for four years,
820.56	I knew nobody in this space,
823.04	and I didn't even know it existed,
823.04	that people could do this stuff,
826.56	that you could have movements like this.
828.56	And then I'm over here in San Francisco,
828.56	and everyone around me was doing it.
832.24	It became normal, so my thinking went
832.24	from how could I possibly do this
836.36	to how could I possibly not.
838.2	And right then, when that happens,
838.2	that switch goes on in your head,
841.44	it ripples across your whole world.
843.131	And without even trying,
843.131	your standards go from here to here.
846.08	You don't need to change your goals.
846.08	You just need to change your surroundings.
849.819	That's it, and that's why I love
849.819	being around this whole group of people,
854.2	why I go to every TED event I can,
855.844	and watch them on my iPad
855.844	on the way to work, whatever it is.
858.8	Because this is the group of people
858.8	that inspires possibility.
862.24	We have a whole day
862.24	to spend together and plenty more.
865.28	To sum things up,
865.28	in terms of these three pillars,
868.76	they all have one thing in common
868.76	more than anything else.
872.72	They are 100 percent in our control.
875.2	No one can tell you
875.2	you can't learn about yourself.
878.28	No one can tell you
878.28	you can't push your limits
880.447	and learn your own impossible
880.447	and push that.
882.76	No one can tell you you can't
882.76	surround yourself with inspiring people
885.72	or get away from the people
885.72	who bring you down.
887.935	You can't control a recession.
889.388	You can't control getting fired
889.388	or getting in a car accident.
892.6	Most things are totally out of our hands.
894.72	These three things are totally on us,
899	and they can change our whole world
899	if we decide to do something about it.
904.08	And the thing is, it's starting to happen
904.08	on a widespread level.
907.104	I just read in Forbes, the US Government
907.104	reported for the first time
910.319	in a month where more people
910.319	had quit their jobs
913.04	than had been laid off.
914.4	They thought this was an anomaly,
914.4	but it's happened three months straight.
917.64	In a time where people claim
917.64	it's kind of a tough environment,
920.36	people are giving a middle finger
920.36	to this scripted life,
922.72	the things that people
922.72	say you're supposed to do,
924.8	in exchange for things that matter to them
924.8	and do the things that inspire them.
928.56	And the thing is, people
928.56	are waking up to this possibility,
931.36	that really the only thing that limits
931.36	possibility now is imagination.
937.36	That's not a cliché anymore.
939.36	I don't care what it is that you're into,
939.36	what passion, what hobby.
942.56	If you're into knitting, you can find
942.56	someone who is killing it knitting,
946.04	and you can learn from them. It's wild.
948.4	And that's what this whole day is about,
948.4	to learn from the folks speaking,
951.92	and we profile these people
951.92	on Live Your Legend every day,
955.36	because when ordinary people
955.36	are doing the extraordinary,
958.08	and we can be around that,
959.88	it becomes normal.
961.64	And this isn't about being Gandhi
961.64	or Steve Jobs, doing something crazy.
965.76	It's just about doing something
965.76	that matters to you,
968.213	and makes an impact
968.213	that only you can make.
971.6	Speaking of Gandhi,
971.6	he was a recovering lawyer,
975.28	as I've heard the term,
976.64	and he was called to a greater cause,
976.64	something that mattered to him,
979.92	he couldn't not do.
981.16	And he has this quote
981.16	that I absolutely live by.
983.423	"""First they ignore you,"
983.423	then they laugh at you,
985.76	"then they fight you, then you win."""
989.96	Everything was impossible
989.96	until somebody did it.
992.64	You can either hang around the people
992.64	who tell you it can't be done
995.84	and tell you you're stupid for trying,
997.68	or surround yourself with the people
997.68	who inspire possibility,
1001	the people who are in this room.
1003.6	Because I see it as our responsibility
1003.6	to show the world
1007.52	that what's seen as impossible
1007.52	can become that new normal.
1010.96	And that's already starting to happen.
1013.16	First, do the things that inspire us,
1015.88	so we can inspire other people
1015.88	to do the things that inspire them.
1019.6	But we can't find that
1022.2	unless we know what we're looking for.
1024.28	We have to do our work on ourself,
1026.4	be intentional about that,
1026.4	and make those discoveries.
1029	Because I imagine a world where 80 percent
1029	of people love the work they do.
1032.548	What would that look like?
1033.88	What would the innovation be like?
1033.88	How would you treat the people around you?
1037.92	Things would start to change.
1040.8	And as we finish up,
1040.8	I have just one question to ask you guys,
1044.04	and I think it's the only
1044.04	question that matters.
1046.8	And it's what is the work
1046.8	you can't not do?
1050.48	Discover that, live it,
1052.76	not just for you,
1052.76	but for everybody around you,
1056.4	because that is what starts
1056.4	to change the world.
1059.28	What is the work you can't not do?
1062.4	Thank you guys.
1063.64	(Applause)
