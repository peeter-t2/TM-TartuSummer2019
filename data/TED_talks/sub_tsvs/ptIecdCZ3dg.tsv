12.716	Here's an intriguing fact.
15.06	In the developed world,
16.86	everywhere, women live an average
16.86	of six to eight years longer than men do.
22.66	Six to eight years longer.
24.98	That's, like, a huge gap.
28.42	"In 2015, the ""Lancet"" published an article"
31.54	showing that men in rich countries
34.02	are twice as likely to die as women are
37.02	at any age.
38.9	But there is one place in the world
41.82	where men live as long as women.
44.299	It's a remote, mountainous zone,
46.38	a blue zone,
47.62	where super longevity
49.14	is common to both sexes.
51.86	This is the blue zone in Sardinia,
53.7	an Italian island in the Mediterranean,
55.74	between Corsica and Tunisia,
58.38	where there are six times
58.38	as many centenarians
61.78	as on the Italian mainland,
63.7	less than 200 miles away.
65.74	There are 10 times as many centenarians
67.66	as there are in North America.
69.86	It's the only place
69.86	where men live as long as women.
72.98	But why?
74.3	My curiosity was piqued.
76.54	I decided to research the science
76.54	and the habits of the place,
79.9	and I started with the genetic profile.
82.34	I discovered soon enough
84.42	that genes account for just
88.46	The other 75 percent is lifestyle.
92.02	So what does it take
92.02	to live to 100 or beyond?
95.34	What are they doing right?
97.22	What you're looking at
97.22	is an aerial view of Villagrande.
100.5	It's a village at the epicenter
100.5	of the blue zone
103.06	where I went to investigate this,
105.22	and as you can see, architectural beauty
105.22	is not its main virtue,
110.66	density is:
112.3	tightly spaced houses,
114.3	interwoven alleys and streets.
116.86	It means that the villagers' lives
116.86	constantly intersect.
121.1	And as I walked through the village,
122.86	I could feel hundreds
122.86	of pairs of eyes watching me
126.02	from behind doorways and curtains,
128.66	from behind shutters.
130.42	Because like all ancient villages,
132.86	Villagrande couldn't have survived
135.46	without this structure,
135.46	without its walls, without its cathedral,
138.74	without its village square,
140.66	because defense and social cohesion
140.66	defined its design.
145.74	Urban priorities changed as we moved
145.74	towards the industrial revolution
149.74	because infectious disease
149.74	became the risk of the day.
152.62	But what about now?
154.38	Now, social isolation
154.38	is the public health risk of our time.
159.78	Now, a third of the population says
162.3	they have two or fewer people to lean on.
165.78	But let's go to Villagrande
165.78	now as a contrast
168.58	to meet some centenarians.
170.66	Meet Giuseppe Murinu.
170.66	He's 102, a supercentenarian
174.58	and a lifelong resident
174.58	of the village of Villagrande.
177.66	He was a gregarious man.
179.62	He loved to recount stories
181.94	such as how he lived like a bird
183.62	from what he could find
183.62	on the forest floor
185.94	during not one but two world wars,
189.34	how he and his wife,
189.34	who also lived past 100,
192.46	raised six children
192.46	in a small, homey kitchen
195.82	where I interviewed him.
197.78	Here he is with his sons
197.78	Angelo and Domenico,
200.42	both in their 70s
200.42	and looking after their father,
203.5	and who were quite frankly
203.5	very suspicious of me and my daughter
207.78	who came along with me
207.78	on this research trip,
210.54	because the flip side of social cohesion
213.38	is a wariness of strangers and outsiders.
216.22	But Giuseppe, he wasn't suspicious at all.
220.14	He was a happy-go-lucky guy,
222.1	very outgoing with a positive outlook.
225.78	And I wondered: so is that what it takes
225.78	to live to be 100 or beyond,
230.34	thinking positively?
233.82	Actually, no.
235.06	(Laughter)
240.66	Meet Giovanni Corrias. He's 101,
243.3	the grumpiest person I have ever met.
246.34	(Laughter)
247.86	And he put a lie to the notion
249.58	that you have to be positive
249.58	to live a long life.
253.22	And there is evidence for this.
254.98	When I asked him why he lived so long,
257.54	he kind of looked at me
257.54	under hooded eyelids and he growled,
260.98	"""Nobody has to know my secrets."""
263.14	(Laughter)
265.38	But despite being a sourpuss,
267.62	the niece who lived with him
267.62	and looked after him
269.98	"called him ""Il Tesoro,"" ""my treasure."""
273.18	And she respected him and loved him,
276.38	and she told me, when I questioned
276.38	this obvious loss of her freedom,
281.22	"""You just don't understand, do you?"
283.1	Looking after this man is a pleasure.
285.82	It's a huge privilege for me.
287.82	"This is my heritage."""
289.86	And indeed, wherever I went
289.86	to interview these centenarians,
293.54	I found a kitchen party.
295.281	Here's Giovanni with his two nieces,
297.02	Maria above him
298.26	and beside him his great-niece Sara,
300.22	who came when I was there
300.22	to bring fresh fruits and vegetables.
304.02	And I quickly discovered by being there
307.34	that in the blue zone, as people age,
309.62	and indeed across their lifespans,
312.1	they're always surrounded
312.1	by extended family, by friends,
316.22	by neighbors, the priest,
316.22	the barkeeper, the grocer.
319.54	People are always there or dropping by.
321.86	They are never left
321.86	to live solitary lives.
325.58	This is unlike the rest
325.58	of the developed world,
328.14	where as George Burns quipped,
329.62	"""Happiness is having a large,"
329.62	"loving, caring family in another city."""
334.1	(Laughter)
335.82	Now, so far we've only met men,
339.26	long-living men, but I met women too,
341.38	and here you see Zia Teresa.
343.46	She, at over 100, taught me
343.46	how to make the local specialty,
347.9	which is called culurgiones,
349.58	which are these large pasta pockets
352.38	like ravioli about this size,
355.26	this size,
356.5	and they're filled
356.5	with high-fat ricotta and mint
359.06	and drenched in tomato sauce.
360.86	And she showed me
360.86	how to make just the right crimp
364.82	so they wouldn't open,
366.62	and she makes them
366.62	with her daughters every Sunday
369.66	and distributes them
369.66	by the dozens to neighbors and friends.
373.38	And that's when I discovered
373.38	a low-fat, gluten-free diet
376.5	is not what it takes
376.5	to live to 100 in the blue zone.
379.14	(Applause)
382.42	Now, these centenarians' stories
382.42	along with the science that underpins them
387.06	prompted me to ask myself
387.06	some questions too,
389.9	such as, when am I going to die
389.9	and how can I put that day off?
394.14	And as you will see,
394.14	the answer is not what we expect.
398.66	Julianne Holt-Lunstad is a researcher
398.66	at Brigham Young University
402.58	and she addressed this very question
404.5	in a series of studies
406.02	of tens of thousands of middle aged people
408.94	much like this audience here.
411.1	And she looked at every
411.1	aspect of their lifestyle:
414.06	their diet, their exercise,
416.22	their marital status,
417.74	how often they went to the doctor,
419.42	whether they smoked or drank, etc.
421.94	She recorded all of this
424.18	and then she and her colleagues
424.18	sat tight and waited for seven years
428.78	to see who would still be breathing.
431.58	And of the people left standing,
434.7	what reduced their chances
434.7	of dying the most?
438.26	That was her question.
439.9	So let's now look at her data in summary,
443.46	going from the least powerful
443.46	predictor to the strongest.
448.22	OK?
449.46	So clean air, which is great,
451.74	it doesn't predict how long you will live.
454.82	Whether you have your hypertension treated
457.58	is good.
458.94	Still not a strong predictor.
460.74	Whether you're lean or overweight,
460.74	you can stop feeling guilty about this,
464.26	because it's only in third place.
466.66	How much exercise you get is next,
469.18	still only a moderate predictor.
471.54	Whether you've had a cardiac event
471.54	and you're in rehab and exercising,
476.3	getting higher now.
477.86	Whether you've had a flu vaccine.
479.5	Did anybody here know
480.78	that having a flu vaccine
480.78	protects you more than doing exercise?
486.54	Whether you were drinking and quit,
489.06	or whether you're a moderate drinker,
491.06	whether you don't smoke,
491.06	or if you did, whether you quit,
495.38	and getting towards the top predictors
499.02	are two features of your social life.
502.58	First, your close relationships.
504.98	These are the people
504.98	that you can call on for a loan
509.3	if you need money suddenly,
511.94	who will call the doctor
511.94	if you're not feeling well
514.54	or who will take you to the hospital,
516.38	or who will sit with you
516.38	if you're having an existential crisis,
521.22	if you're in despair.
523.22	Those people, that little clutch of people
525.859	are a strong predictor, if you have them,
525.859	of how long you'll live.
529.42	And then something that surprised me,
531.78	something that's called
531.78	social integration.
534.42	This means how much
534.42	you interact with people
538.5	as you move through your day.
540.58	How many people do you talk to?
542.7	And these mean both
542.7	your weak and your strong bonds,
546.3	so not just the people
546.3	you're really close to,
548.82	who mean a lot to you,
550.22	but, like, do you talk to the guy
550.22	who every day makes you your coffee?
554.78	Do you talk to the postman?
556.58	Do you talk to the woman who walks
556.58	by your house every day with her dog?
560.06	Do you play bridge or poker,
560.06	have a book club?
563.06	Those interactions
563.06	are one of the strongest predictors
566.26	of how long you'll live.
567.62	Now, this leads me to the next question:
570.66	if we now spend more time online
570.66	than on any other activity,
576.1	including sleeping,
577.78	we're now up to 11 hours a day,
579.98	one hour more than last year, by the way,
582.5	does it make a difference?
584.34	Why distinguish
584.34	between interacting in person
588.38	and interacting via social media?
590.62	Is it the same thing as being there
593.5	if you're in contact constantly
593.5	with your kids through text, for example?
598.02	Well, the short answer
598.02	to the question is no,
600.18	it's not the same thing.
601.86	Face-to-face contact releases
601.86	a whole cascade of neurotransmitters,
606.7	and like a vaccine,
606.7	they protect you now in the present
610.02	and well into the future.
611.9	So simply making
611.9	eye contact with somebody,
615.42	shaking hands, giving somebody a high-five
618.02	is enough to release oxytocin,
620.1	which increases your level of trust
622.34	and it lowers your cortisol levels.
624.74	So it lowers your stress.
627.26	And dopamine is generated,
627.26	which gives us a little high
630.1	and it kills pain.
631.34	It's like a naturally produced morphine.
634.98	Now, all of this passes
634.98	under our conscious radar,
637.7	which is why we conflate
637.7	online activity with the real thing.
642.02	But we do have evidence now,
642.02	fresh evidence,
644.38	that there is a difference.
645.74	So let's look at some of the neuroscience.
647.82	Elizabeth Redcay, a neuroscientist
647.82	at the University of Maryland,
651.14	tried to map the difference
652.98	between what goes on in our brains
652.98	when we interact in person
656.66	versus when we're watching
656.66	something that's static.
659.9	And what she did was
659.9	she compared the brain function
662.353	of two groups of people,
664.42	those interacting live with her
667.74	or with one of her research associates
669.9	in a dynamic conversation,
672.1	and she compared that
672.1	to the brain activity of people
674.62	who were watching her talk
674.62	about the same subject
678.38	but in a canned video, like on YouTube.
681.7	And by the way, if you want to know
683.42	how she fit two people
683.42	in an MRI scanner at the same time,
686.26	talk to me later.
688.18	So what's the difference?
691.1	This is your brain
691.1	on real social interaction.
694.66	What you're seeing
694.66	is the difference in brain activity
697.58	between interacting in person
697.58	and taking in static content.
702.74	In orange, you see the brain areas
702.74	that are associated with attention,
707.74	social intelligence --
708.98	that means anticipating
708.98	what somebody else is thinking
711.58	and feeling and planning --
713.34	and emotional reward.
714.9	And these areas become much more engaged
717.7	when we're interacting
717.7	with a live partner.
721.94	Now, these richer brain signatures
724.66	might be why recruiters
724.66	from Fortune 500 companies
728.74	evaluating candidates
730.7	thought that the candidates were smarter
733.5	when they heard their voices
735.98	compared to when they just
735.98	read their pitches in a text, for example,
739.26	or an email or a letter.
740.7	Now, our voices and body language
740.7	convey a rich signal.
743.5	It shows that we're thinking, feeling,
745.54	sentient human beings
747.22	who are much more than an algorithm.
749.74	Now, this research by Nicholas Epley
751.82	at the University of Chicago
751.82	Business School
756.26	is quite amazing because
756.26	it tells us a simple thing.
759.58	If somebody hears your voice,
761.66	they think you're smarter.
763.66	I mean, that's quite a simple thing.
767.14	Now, to return to the beginning,
769.86	why do women live longer than men?
771.78	And one major reason
771.78	is that women are more likely
774.14	to prioritize and groom
774.14	their face-to-face relationships
777.54	over their lifespans.
779.22	Fresh evidence shows
780.9	that these in-person friendships
782.62	create a biological force field
782.62	against disease and decline.
786.62	And it's not just true of humans
788.82	but their primate relations,
788.82	our primate relations as well.
792.22	Anthropologist Joan Silk's work
792.22	shows that female baboons
795.9	who have a core of female friends
798.82	show lower levels of stress
798.82	via their cortisol levels,
802.42	they live longer and they have
802.42	more surviving offspring.
806.46	At least three stable relationships.
808.86	That was the magic number.
810.38	Think about it.
811.62	I hope you guys have three.
814.26	The power of such face-to-face contact
818.3	is really why there are
818.3	the lowest rates of dementia
821.14	among people who are socially engaged.
823.98	It's why women who have breast cancer
825.82	are four times more likely
825.82	to survive their disease than loners are.
831.14	Why men who've had a stroke
831.14	who meet regularly to play poker
835.14	or to have coffee
836.82	or to play old-timer's hockey --
839.1	I'm Canadian, after all --
840.42	(Laughter)
841.58	are better protected
841.58	by that social contact
844.1	than they are by medication.
846.14	Why men who've had a stroke
846.14	who meet regularly --
849.26	this is something very
849.26	powerful they can do.
851.74	This face-to-face contact
851.74	provides stunning benefits,
855.46	yet now almost a quarter of the population
855.46	says they have no one to talk to.
860.98	We can do something about this.
863.34	Like Sardinian villagers,
865.14	it's a biological imperative
865.14	to know we belong,
868.86	and not just the women among us.
870.9	Building in-person interaction
870.9	into our cities, into our workplaces,
875.06	into our agendas
877.66	bolsters the immune system,
879.14	sends feel-good hormones
879.14	surging through the bloodstream and brain
883.18	and helps us live longer.
885.66	I call this building your village,
888.34	and building it and sustaining it
888.34	is a matter of life and death.
892.58	Thank you.
893.82	(Applause)
899.95	Helen Walters: Susan, come back.
899.95	I have a question for you.
902.74	I'm wondering if there's a middle path.
904.66	So you talk about the neurotransmitters
904.66	connecting when in face-to-face,
908.1	but what about digital technology?
909.78	We've seen enormous improvements
909.78	in digital technology
912.38	like FaceTime, things like that.
914.86	Does that work too?
916.14	I mean, I see my nephew.
917.42	He plays Minecraft
917.42	and he's yelling at his friends.
919.86	It seems like he's connecting pretty well.
921.9	Is that useful? Is that helpful?
923.7	Susan Pinker: Some of the data
923.7	are just emerging.
926.06	The data are so fresh
926.06	that the digital revolution happened
929.06	and the health data trailed behind.
931.82	So we're just learning,
933.22	but I would say
933.22	there are some improvements
935.26	that we could make in the technology.
937.1	For example, the camera on your laptop
937.1	is at the top of the screen,
940.58	so for example, when you're
940.58	looking into the screen,
943.66	you're not actually making eye contact.
945.58	So something as simple
945.58	as even just looking into the camera
948.78	can increase those neurotransmitters,
951.06	or maybe changing
951.06	the position of the camera.
953.66	So it's not identical, but I think
953.66	we are getting closer with the technology.
957.38	HW: Great. Thank you so much.
959.14	SP: Thank you.
960.38	(Applause)
