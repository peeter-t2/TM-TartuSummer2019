19.893	Hi. My name is Marwa,
19.893	and I'm an architect.
23.167	I was born and raised in Homs,
25.017	a city in the central
25.017	western part of Syria,
27.759	and I've always lived here.
29.905	After six years of war,
31.501	Homs is now a half-destroyed city.
34.001	My family and I were lucky;
34.001	our place is still standing.
37.152	Although for two years,
37.152	we were like prisoners at home.
40.359	Outside there were demonstrations
40.359	and battles and bombings and snipers.
46.08	My husband and I used to run
46.08	an architecture studio
49.156	in the old town main square.
51.333	It's gone, as is most
51.333	of the old town itself.
54.685	Half of the city's other neighborhoods
56.59	are now rubble.
58.414	Since the ceasefire in late 2015,
60.67	large parts of Homs
60.67	have been more or less quiet.
63.609	The economy is completely broken,
63.609	and people are still fighting.
67.326	The merchants who had stalls
67.326	in the old city market
69.827	now trade out of sheds on the streets.
72.296	Under our apartment, there is a carpenter,
74.816	sweetshops, a butcher, a printing house,
74.816	workshops, among many more.
80.251	I have started teaching part-time,
82.399	and with my husband,
82.399	who juggles several jobs,
84.937	we've opened a small bookshop.
86.938	Other people do all sorts
86.938	of jobs to get by.
90.803	When I look at my destroyed city,
90.803	of course, I ask myself:
94.081	What has led to this senseless war?
96.778	Syria was largely a place of tolerance,
99.033	historically accustomed to variety,
101.097	accommodating a wide range
101.097	of beliefs, origins, customs,
104.402	goods, food.
106.315	How did my country --
107.504	a country with communities
107.504	living harmoniously together
110.226	and comfortable in discussing
110.226	their differences --
112.741	how did it degenerate into civil war,
112.741	violence, displacement
116.85	and unprecedented sectarian hatred?
120.239	There were many reasons
120.239	that had led to the war --
123.071	social, political and economic.
125.743	They all have played their role.
127.331	But I believe there is one key reason
127.331	that has been overlooked
131.227	and which is important to analyze,
133.161	because from it will largely depend
135.511	whether we can make sure
135.511	that this doesn't happen again.
139.372	And that reason is architecture.
141.818	Architecture in my country
141.818	has played an important role
144.423	in creating, directing and amplifying
144.423	conflict between warring factions,
148.467	and this is probably true
148.467	for other countries as well.
151.75	There is a sure correspondence
151.75	between the architecture of a place
155.306	and the character of the community
155.306	that has settled there.
158.711	Architecture plays a key role
158.711	in whether a community crumbles
162.45	or comes together.
164.06	Syrian society has long lived
164.06	the coexistence
166.589	of different traditions and backgrounds.
168.969	Syrians have experienced
168.969	the prosperity of open trade
171.723	and sustainable communities.
173.499	They have enjoyed the true meaning
173.499	of belonging to a place,
176.594	and that was reflected
176.594	in their built environment,
179.321	in the mosques and churches
179.321	built back-to-back,
181.813	in the interwoven souks and public venues,
184.084	and the proportions and sizes based
184.084	on principles of humanity and harmony.
188.948	This architecture of mixity
188.948	can still be read in the remains.
192.384	The old Islamic city in Syria
192.384	was built over a multilayered past,
196.147	integrating with it
196.147	and embracing its spirit.
198.602	So did its communities.
200.253	People lived and worked with each other
202.205	in a place that gave them
202.205	a sense of belonging
204.435	and made them feel at home.
206.464	They shared a remarkably
206.464	unified existence.
209.748	But over the last century,
211.237	gradually this delicate balance
211.237	of these places has been interfered with;
215.762	first, by the urban planners
215.762	of the colonial period,
218.466	when the French went
218.466	enthusiastically about,
220.704	transforming what they saw
220.704	as the un-modern Syrian cities.
223.986	They blew up city streets
223.986	and relocated monuments.
228.255	They called them improvements,
230.255	and they were the beginning
230.255	of a long, slow unraveling.
233.655	The traditional urbanism
233.655	and architecture of our cities
236.569	assured identity and belonging
236.569	not by separation,
239.759	but by intertwining.
241.537	But over time, the ancient became
241.537	worthless, and the new, coveted.
245.641	The harmony of the built environment
245.641	and social environment
248.657	got trampled over
248.657	by elements of modernity --
251.344	brutal, unfinished concrete blocks,
253.55	neglect, aesthetic devastation,
256.273	divisive urbanism that zoned
256.273	communities by class, creed or affluence.
261.859	And the same was happening
261.859	to the community.
264.352	As the shape of the built
264.352	environment changed,
266.971	so the lifestyles and sense
266.971	of belonging of the communities
270.303	also started changing.
272.038	From a register
272.038	of togetherness, of belonging,
274.679	architecture became
274.679	a way of differentiation,
277.274	and communities started drifting apart
279.695	from the very fabric
279.695	that used to unite them,
282.69	and from the soul of the place that used
282.69	to represent their common existence.
287.441	While many reasons had led
287.441	to the Syrian war,
289.854	we shouldn't underestimate
289.854	the way in which,
291.997	by contributing to the loss 
291.997	of identity and self-respect,
295.87	urban zoning and misguided,
295.87	inhumane architecture
299.271	have nurtured sectarian
299.271	divisions and hatred.
302.416	Over time, the united city
302.416	has morphed into a city center
305.829	with ghettos along its circumference.
308.782	And in turn, the coherent communities
308.782	became distinct social groups,
312.871	alienated from each other
312.871	and alienated from the place.
317.133	From my point of view,
318.515	losing the sense of belonging to a place
320.656	and a sense of sharing it
320.656	with someone else
322.852	has made it a lot easier to destroy.
325.196	The clear example can be seen
325.196	in the informal housing system,
328.904	which used to host, before the war,
328.904	over 40 percent of the population.
333.424	Yes, prior to the war,
333.424	almost half of the Syrian population
337.258	lived in slums,
338.717	peripheral areas
338.717	without proper infrastructure,
341.843	made of endless rows of bare block boxes
344.74	containing people,
346.192	people who mostly belonged
346.192	to the same group,
348.351	whether based on religion,
348.351	class, origin or all of the above.
353.772	This ghettoized urbanism
353.772	proved to be a tangible precursor of war.
358.43	Conflict is much easier
358.43	between pre-categorized areas --
361.808	"where the ""others"" live."
363.75	The ties that used
363.75	to bind the city together --
366.307	whether they were social,
366.307	through coherent building,
368.991	or economic, through trade in the souk,
371.148	or religious, through
371.148	the coexistent presence --
374.058	were all lost in the misguided
374.058	and visionless modernization
377.794	of the built environment.
379.782	Allow me an aside.
381.467	When I read about heterogeneous urbanism
381.467	in other parts of the world,
385.674	involving ethnic neighborhoods
385.674	in British cities
388.17	or around Paris or Brussels,
390.303	I recognize the beginning
390.303	of the kind of instability
393.921	we have witnessed
393.921	so disastrously here in Syria.
398.027	We have severely destroyed cities,
400.257	such as Homs, Aleppo,
400.257	Daraa and many others,
403.462	and almost half of the population
403.462	of the country is now displaced.
407.345	Hopefully, the war will end,
409.517	and the question that,
409.517	as an architect, I have to ask, is:
413.341	How do we rebuild?
415.317	What are the principles
415.317	that we should adopt
417.977	in order to avoid repeating
417.977	the same mistakes?
421.099	From my point of view, the main focus
421.099	should be on creating places
424.662	that make their people feel they belong.
426.854	Architecture and planning
426.854	need to recapture
429.373	some of the traditional values
429.373	that did just that,
432.301	creating the conditions
432.301	for coexistence and peace,
435.556	values of beauty
435.556	that don't exhibit ostentation,
438.848	but rather, approachability and ease,
441.237	moral values that promote
441.237	generosity and acceptance,
444.768	architecture that is for everyone
444.768	to enjoy, not just for the elite,
448.769	just as used to be in the shadowed alleys
448.769	of the old Islamic city,
452.445	mixed designs that encourage
452.445	a sense of community.
456.326	There is a neighborhood here in Homs
456.326	that's called Baba Amr
459.589	that has been fully destroyed.
461.714	Almost two years ago,
461.714	I introduced this design
464.264	into a UN-Habitat competition
464.264	for rebuilding it.
467.285	The idea was to create an urban fabric
467.285	inspired by a tree,
471.647	capable of growing
471.647	and spreading organically,
474.592	echoing the traditional bridge
474.592	hanging over the old alleys,
477.838	and incorporating apartments,
477.838	private courtyards, shops,
481.614	workshops, places for parking
481.614	and playing and leisure,
485.011	trees and shaded areas.
487.625	It's far from perfect, obviously.
489.635	I drew it during the few hours
489.635	of electricity we get.
492.93	And there are many possible ways
492.93	to express belonging and community
496.552	through architecture.
497.727	But compare it with the freestanding,
497.727	disconnected blocks
500.795	proposed by the official project
500.795	for rebuilding Baba Amr.
504.774	Architecture is not the axis
504.774	around which all human life rotates,
508.406	but it has the power to suggest
508.406	and even direct human activity.
513.231	In that sense, settlement,
513.231	identity and social integration
517.407	are all the producer and product
517.407	of effective urbanism.
521.99	The coherent urbanism
521.99	of the old Islamic city
524.97	and of many old European
524.97	towns, for instance,
527.89	promote integration,
529.647	while rows of soulless housing
529.647	or tower blocks,
532.908	even when they are luxurious,
534.697	"tend to promote isolation and ""otherness."""
537.958	Even simple things
539.232	like shaded places or fruit plants
539.232	or drinking water inside the city
543.112	can make a difference
543.112	in how people feel towards the place,
546.311	and whether they consider it
546.311	a generous place that gives,
549.524	a place that's worth keeping,
549.524	contributing to,
552.72	or whether they see it
552.72	as an alienating place,
555.101	full of seeds of anger.
557.291	In order for a place to give,
557.291	its architecture should be giving, too.
562.1	Our built environment matters.
564.128	The fabric of our cities is reflected
564.128	in the fabric of our souls.
568.802	And whether in the shape
568.802	of informal concrete slums
571.777	or broken social housing
573.427	or trampled old towns
575.21	or forests of skyscrapers,
576.98	the contemporary urban archetypes
579.107	that have emerged
579.107	all across the Middle East
581.839	have been one cause of the alienation
581.839	and fragmentation of our communities.
586.971	We can learn from this.
588.488	We can learn how to rebuild
588.488	in another way,
591.365	how to create an architecture
591.365	that doesn't contribute only
594.706	to the practical and economic
594.706	aspects of people's lives,
597.687	but also to their social, spiritual
597.687	and psychological needs.
602.043	Those needs were totally overlooked
602.043	in the Syrian cities before the war.
606.575	We need to create again
606.575	cities that are shared
609.342	by the communities that inhabit them.
611.777	If we do so, people will not feel the need
614.69	to seek identities opposed
614.69	to the other identities all around,
618.563	because they will all feel at home.
622.246	Thank you for listening.
