15.26	This story
17.26	is about taking imagination seriously.
20.26	Fourteen years ago,
22.26	I first encountered this ordinary material, fishnet,
25.26	used the same way for centuries.
28.26	Today, I'm using it to create
30.26	permanent, billowing, voluptuous forms
33.26	the scale of hard-edged buildings
35.26	in cities around the world.
38.26	I was an unlikely person to be doing this.
41.26	I never studied sculpture,
43.26	engineering or architecture.
45.26	In fact, after college
47.26	I applied to seven art schools
49.26	and was rejected by all seven.
53.26	I went off on my own to become an artist,
55.26	and I painted for 10 years,
59.26	when I was offered a Fulbright to India.
62.26	Promising to give exhibitions of paintings,
65.26	I shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram.
67.26	The deadline for the show arrived --
70.26	my paints didn't.
72.26	I had to do something.
74.26	This fishing village was famous for sculpture.
76.26	So I tried bronze casting.
79.26	But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive.
82.26	I went for a walk on the beach,
84.26	watching the fishermen
86.26	bundle their nets into mounds on the sand.
88.26	I'd seen it every day,
90.26	but this time I saw it differently --
92.26	a new approach to sculpture,
94.26	a way to make volumetric form
97.26	without heavy solid materials.
100.26	My first satisfying sculpture
102.26	was made in collaboration with these fishermen.
105.26	It's a self-portrait
107.26	"titled ""Wide Hips."""
109.26	(Laughter)
113.26	We hoisted them on poles to photograph.
116.26	I discovered
118.26	their soft surfaces
120.26	revealed every ripple of wind
122.26	in constantly changing patterns.
124.26	I was mesmerized.
127.26	I continued studying craft traditions
130.26	and collaborating with artisans,
132.26	next in Lithuania with lace makers.
134.26	I liked the fine detail
136.26	it gave my work,
138.26	but I wanted to make them larger --
140.26	to shift from being an object you look at
142.26	to something you could get lost in.
145.26	Returning to India to work with those fishermen,
148.26	we made a net
150.26	of a million and a half hand-tied knots --
155.26	installed briefly in Madrid.
158.26	Thousands of people saw it,
160.26	and one of them was the urbanist
162.26	Manual Sola-Morales
164.26	who was redesigning the waterfront
166.26	in Porto, Portugal.
169.26	He asked if I could build this
171.26	as a permanent piece for the city.
173.26	I didn't know if I could do that
175.26	and preserve my art.
177.26	Durable, engineered, permanent --
180.26	those are in opposition
182.26	to idiosyncratic, delicate and ephemeral.
186.26	For two years, I searched for a fiber
189.26	that could survive ultraviolet rays,
191.26	salt, air, pollution,
194.26	and at the same time remain soft enough
196.26	to move fluidly in the wind.
199.26	We needed something to hold the net up
201.26	out there in the middle of the traffic circle.
203.26	So we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring.
208.26	We had to engineer it
210.26	to move gracefully in an average breeze
212.26	and survive in hurricane winds.
215.26	But there was no engineering software
218.26	to model something porous and moving.
222.26	I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer
225.26	who designs sails for America's Cup racing yachts
228.26	named Peter Heppel.
231.26	He helped me tackle the twin challenges
233.26	of precise shape
235.26	and gentle movement.
238.26	I couldn't build this the way I knew
240.26	because hand-tied knots
242.26	weren't going to withstand a hurricane.
244.26	So I developed a relationship
246.26	with an industrial fishnet factory,
248.26	learned the variables of their machines,
250.26	and figured out a way
252.26	to make lace with them.
255.26	There was no language
257.26	to translate this ancient, idiosyncratic handcraft
261.26	into something machine operators could produce.
264.26	So we had to create one.
267.26	Three years and two children later,
271.26	we raised this 50,000-square-foot lace net.
274.26	It was hard to believe
276.26	that what I had imagined
278.26	was now built, permanent
281.26	and had lost nothing in translation.
284.26	(Applause)
289.26	This intersection had been bland and anonymous.
292.26	Now it had a sense of place.
295.26	I walked underneath it
297.26	for the first time.
299.26	As I watched the wind's choreography unfold,
302.26	I felt sheltered
304.26	and, at the same time,
306.26	connected to limitless sky.
308.26	My life was not going to be the same.
319.26	I want to create these oases of sculpture
322.26	in spaces of cities around the world.
325.26	I'm going to share two directions
327.26	that are new in my work.
330.26	Historic Philadelphia City Hall:
332.26	its plaza, I felt, needed a material for sculpture
336.26	that was lighter than netting.
338.26	So we experimented
340.26	with tiny atomized water particles
342.26	to create a dry mist
344.26	that is shaped by the wind
346.26	and in testing, discovered
348.26	that it can be shaped by people
350.26	who can interact and move through it without getting wet.
353.26	I'm using this sculpture material
356.26	to trace the paths of subway trains above ground
360.26	in real time --
363.26	like an X-ray of the city's circulatory system unfolding.
371.26	Next challenge,
373.26	the Biennial of the Americas in Denver
375.26	asked, could I represent
377.26	the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness
380.26	in a sculpture?
382.26	(Laughter)
385.26	I didn't know where to begin,
387.26	but I said yes.
389.26	I read about the recent earthquake in Chile
392.26	and the tsunami that rippled across
394.26	the entire Pacific Ocean.
396.26	It shifted the Earth's tectonic plates,
399.26	sped up the planet's rotation
401.26	and literally shortened the length of the day.
404.26	So I contacted NOAA,
407.26	and I asked if they'd share their data on the tsunami,
410.26	and translated it into this.
415.26	"Its title: ""1.26"""
418.26	refers to the number of microseconds
420.26	that the Earth's day was shortened.
423.26	I couldn't build this with a steel ring, the way I knew.
426.26	Its shape was too complex now.
429.26	So I replaced the metal armature
431.26	with a soft, fine mesh
433.26	of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel.
437.26	The sculpture could now be entirely soft,
441.26	which made it so light
443.26	it could tie in to existing buildings --
446.26	literally becoming part of the fabric of the city.
449.26	There was no software
451.26	that could extrude these complex net forms
454.26	and model them with gravity.
456.26	So we had to create it.
459.26	Then I got a call from New York City
462.26	asking if I could adapt these concepts
465.26	to Times Square
467.26	or the High Line.
469.26	This new soft structural method
472.26	enables me to model these
474.26	and build these sculptures
476.26	at the scale of skyscrapers.
479.26	They don't have funding yet,
481.26	but I dream now
483.26	of bringing these to cities around the world
486.26	where they're most needed.
489.26	Fourteen years ago,
492.26	I searched for beauty
495.26	in the traditional things,
497.26	in craft forms.
502.26	Now I combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering
506.26	to create voluptuous, billowing forms
509.26	the scale of buildings.
512.26	My artistic horizons continue to grow.
515.26	I'll leave you with this story.
518.26	I got a call from a friend in Phoenix.
521.26	An attorney in the office
523.26	who'd never been interested in art,
525.26	never visited the local art museum,
528.26	dragged everyone she could from the building
531.26	and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture.
534.26	There they were in their business suits,
536.26	laying in the grass,
538.26	noticing the changing patterns of wind
540.26	beside people they didn't know,
542.26	sharing the rediscovery of wonder.
546.26	Thank you.
548.26	(Applause)
551.26	Thank you. Thank you.
553.26	Thank you.
555.26	Thank you. Thank you.
558.26	(Applause)
