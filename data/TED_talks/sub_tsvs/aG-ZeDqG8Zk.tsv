12.685	The urban explosion
15.727	of the last years of economic boom
19.952	also produced dramatic marginalization,
23.463	resulting in the explosion of slums
25.737	in many parts of the world.
28.352	This polarization of enclaves of mega-wealth
31.599	surrounded by sectors of poverty
34.434	and the socioeconomic inequalities
34.434	they have engendered
37.816	is really at the center of today's urban crisis.
41.378	But I want to begin tonight
43.736	by suggesting that this urban crisis
46.174	is not only economic or environmental.
50.054	It's particularly a cultural crisis,
52.952	a crisis of the institutions
55.837	unable to reimagine the stupid ways
59.573	which we have been growing,
61.997	unable to challenge the oil-hungry,
65.31	selfish urbanization that have perpetuated
69.067	cities based on consumption,
71.529	from southern California to New York to Dubai.
76.96	So I just really want to share with you a reflection
80.958	that the future of cities today
83.298	depends less on buildings
85.989	and, in fact, depends more
88.404	on the fundamental reorganization
88.404	of socioeconomic relations,
93.154	that the best ideas in the shaping
95.158	of the city in the future
96.988	will not come from enclaves of economic power
101.037	and abundance,
102.415	but in fact from sectors of conflict and scarcity
108.046	from which an urgent imagination
110.886	can really inspire us to rethink urban growth today.
114.91	And let me illustrate what I mean
118.49	by understanding or engaging sites of conflict
122.395	as harboring creativity, as I briefly introduce you
126.476	to the Tijuana-San Diego border region,
129.009	which has been the laboratory to
129.009	rethink my practice as an architect.
133.214	This is the wall, the border wall,
135.726	that separates San Diego and Tijuana,
138.237	Latin America and the United States,
141.078	a physical emblem
143.115	of exclusionary planning policies
145.765	that have perpetuated the division
148.276	of communities, jurisdictions
150.709	and resources across the world.
153.844	In this border region, we find
156.547	some of the wealthiest real estate,
158.964	as I once found in the edges of San Diego,
161.431	barely 20 minutes away
163.655	from some of the poorest 
163.655	settlements in Latin America.
167.781	And while these two cities have the same population,
171.144	San Diego has grown six times larger than Tijuana
174.98	in the last decades,
176.742	immediately thrusting us to confront
180.132	the tensions and conflicts
182.179	between sprawl and density,
183.927	which are at the center of today's discussion
185.918	about environmental sustainability.
188.746	So I've been arguing in the last years
191.478	that, in fact, the slums of Tijuana can teach a lot
195.183	to the sprawls of San Diego
196.844	when it comes to socioeconomic sustainability,
200.374	that we should pay attention and learn
202.793	from the many migrant communities
205.106	on both sides of this border wall
207.621	so that we can translate their informal processes
210.958	of urbanization.
213.017	What do I mean by the informal in this case?
216.139	I'm really just talking about
217.967	the compendium of social practices of adaptation
221.623	that enable many of these migrant communities
224.462	to transgress imposed political and economic recipes
229.016	of urbanization.
230.569	I'm talking simply about the creative intelligence
233.819	of the bottom-up,
236.194	whether manifested in the slums of Tijuana
239.391	that build themselves, in fact,
239.391	with the waste of San Diego,
243.135	or the many migrant neighborhoods
243.135	in Southern California
245.893	that have begun to be retrofitted with difference
248.969	in the last decades.
250.626	So I've been interested as an artist
252.834	in the measuring, the observation,
255.418	of many of the trans-border informal flows
257.69	across this border:
259.38	in one direction, from south to north,
261.817	the flow of immigrants into the United States,
264.41	and from north to south the flow of waste
267.419	from southern California into Tijuana.
270.45	I'm referring to the recycling
272.718	of these old post-war bungalows
276.17	that Mexican contractors bring to the border
279.629	as American developers are disposing of them
282.474	in the process of building a more inflated version
285.042	of suburbia in the last decades.
287.118	So these are houses waiting to cross the border.
290.033	Not only people cross the border here,
292.385	but entire chunks of one city move to the next,
295.652	and when these houses are placed
295.652	on top of these steel frames,
299.546	they leave the first floor to become the second
302.123	to be in-filled with more house,
304.177	with a small business.
305.835	This layering of spaces and economies
308.712	is very interesting to notice.
310.994	But not only houses, also small debris
313.509	from one city, from San Diego, to Tijuana.
315.856	Probably a lot of you have seen the rubber tires
318.242	that are used in the slums to build retaining walls.
320.871	But look at what people have done here in conditions
323.224	of socioeconomic emergency.
325.452	They have figured out how to peel off the tire,
328.613	how to thread it and interlock it
330.978	to construct a more efficient retaining wall.
335.106	Or the garage doors that are brought
338.318	from San Diego in trucks
340.826	to become the new skin of emergency housing
345.555	in many of these slums
347.394	surrounding the edges of Tijuana.
349.724	So while, as an architect,
351.14	this is a very compelling thing to witness,
353.067	this creative intelligence,
354.761	I also want to keep myself in check.
356.774	I don't want to romanticize poverty.
358.81	I just want to suggest
360.801	that this informal urbanization
362.942	is not just the image of precariousness,
366.541	that informality here, the informal,
369.623	is really a set of socioeconomic
369.623	and political procedures
374.153	that we could translate as artists,
376.862	that this is about a bottom-up urbanization
379.207	that performs.
380.732	See here, buildings are not important
383.558	just for their looks,
385.521	but, in fact, they are important for what they can do.
388.962	They truly perform as they transform through time
392.076	and as communities negotiate
394.224	the spaces and boundaries and resources.
397.733	So while waste flows southbound,
400.854	people go north in search of dollars,
403.382	and most of my research has had to do
405.917	with the impact of immigration
409.812	in the alteration of the homogeneity
412.286	of many neighborhoods in the United States,
414.612	particularly in San Diego.
416.576	And I'm talking about how this begins to suggest
418.961	that the future of Southern California
421.614	depends on the retrofitting
424.137	of the large urbanization -- I mean, on steroids --
427.344	with the small programs,
429.832	social and economic.
431.608	I'm referring to how immigrants,
433.713	when they come to these neighborhoods,
435.511	they begin to alter the one-dimensionality
438.562	of parcels and properties
440.544	into more socially and
440.544	economically complex systems,
444.931	as they begin to plug an
444.931	informal economy into a garage,
448.668	or as they build an illegal granny flat
450.982	to support an extended family.
453.484	This socioeconomic entrepreneurship
458.559	on the ground within these neighborhoods
461.662	really begins to suggest ways of translating that
465.208	into new, inclusive and more equitable
469.355	land use policies.
471.394	So many stories emerge from these dynamics
474.125	of alteration of space,
476.986	such as &amp;quot;the informal Buddha,&amp;quot;
478.834	which tells the story of a small house
481.407	that saved itself, it did not travel to Mexico,
484.408	but it was retrofitted in the end
486.412	into a Buddhist temple,
488.662	and in so doing,
489.891	this small house transforms or mutates
493.147	from a singular dwelling
494.845	into a small, or a micro, socioeconomic
497.667	and cultural infrastructure inside a neighborhood.
501.623	So these action neighborhoods, as I call them,
504.37	really become the inspiration
506.398	to imagine other interpretations of citizenship
509.794	that have less to do, in fact,
511.974	with belonging to the nation-state,
513.956	and more with upholding the notion of citizenship
517.802	as a creative act
519.696	that reorganizes institutional protocols
522.547	in the spaces of the city.
524.877	As an artist, I've been interested, in fact,
527.732	in the visualization of citizenship,
530.461	the gathering of many anecdotes, urban stories,
534.026	in order to narrativize the relationship
537.094	between social processes and spaces.
540.224	This is a story of a group of teenagers
543.343	that one night, a few months ago,
546.266	decided to invade this space under the freeway
549.198	to begin constructing their own skateboard park.
552.412	With shovels in hand, they started to dig.
555.553	Two weeks later, the police stopped them.
558.41	They barricaded the place,
560.111	and the teenagers were evicted,
562.063	and the teenagers decided to fight back,
564.776	not with bank cards or slogans
567.243	but with constructing a critical process.
569.996	The first thing they did was to recognize
572.711	the specificity of political jurisdiction
575.691	inscribed in that empty space.
578.418	They found out that they had been lucky
580.496	because they had not begun to dig
582.31	under Caltrans territoy.
584.693	Caltrans is a state agency that governs the freeway,
587.925	so it would have been very
587.925	difficult to negotiate with them.
590.49	They were lucky, they said, because they began
592.37	to dig under an arm of the freeway
594.777	that belongs to the local municipality.
597.04	They were also lucky, they said,
598.939	because they began to dig in a sort of
600.677	Bermuda Triangle of jurisdiction,
603.019	between port authority, airport authority,
606.496	two city districts, and a review board.
609.309	All these red lines are the invisible
612.087	political institutions that were inscribed
614.665	in that leftover empty space.
617.699	With this knowledge, these teenagers
620.654	as skaters confronted the city.
623.337	They came to the city attorney's office.
625.491	The city attorney told them
627.44	that in order to continue the negotiation
629.336	they had to become an NGO,
631.279	and of course they didn't know what an NGO was.
633.54	They had to talk to their friends in Seattle
636.479	who had gone through the same experience.
638.39	And they began to realize the necessity
640.574	to organize themselves even deeper
642.913	and began to fundraise, to organize budgets,
647.047	to really be aware of all the knowledge
649.371	embedded in the urban code in San Diego
652.604	so that they could begin to redefine
654.822	the very meaning of public space in the city,
658.642	expanding it to other categories.
661.134	At the end, the teenagers won the case
663.769	with that evidence, and they were able
666.242	to construct their skateboard park
668.857	under that freeway.
670.467	Now for many of you, this story
672.912	might seem trivial or naive.
675.152	For me as an architect, it has become
677.101	a fundamental narrative,
679.439	because it begins to teach me
681.292	that this micro-community
683.247	not only designed another category of public space
686.739	but they also designed the socioeconomic protocols
690.544	that were necessary to be inscribed in that space
693.641	for its long-term sustainability.
696.602	They also taught me
698.087	that similar to the migrant communities
700.122	on both sides of the border,
701.651	they engaged conflict itself as a creative tool,
705.368	because they had to produce a process
707.172	that enabled them to reorganize resources
710.789	and the politics of the city.
712.623	In that act, that informal,
715.148	bottom-up act of transgression,
717.403	really began to trickle up
719.552	to transform top-down policy.
722.67	Now this journey from the bottom-up
727.173	to the transformation of the top-down
729.353	is where I find hope today.
731.871	And I'm thinking of how these modest alterations
736.12	with space and with policy
739.063	in many cities in the world,
741.088	in primarily the urgency
743.802	of a collective imagination
746.076	as these communities
747.55	reimagine their own forms of governance,
749.957	social organization, and infrastructure,
752.648	really is at the center
754.576	of the new formation
756.664	of democratic politics of the urban.
759.976	It is, in fact, this that could become the framework
763.253	for producing new social
766.274	and economic justice in the city.
769.33	I want to say this and emphasize it,
770.948	because this is the only way I see
774.597	that can enable us to move
776.81	from urbanizations of consumption
780.035	to neighborhoods of production today.
783.393	Thank you.
785.281	(Applause)
