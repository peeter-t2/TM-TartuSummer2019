18.33	I’d like to dedicate this next song to Carmelo,
21.33	who was put to sleep a couple of days ago, because he got too old.
26.33	But apparently he was a very nice dog
28.33	and he always let the cat sleep in the dog bed.
35.33	♫ (Dog panting noise) Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. ♫
39.33	♫ I'm just a'walking my dog, singing my song, strolling along. ♫
45.33	♫ Yeah, it's just me and my dog, catching some sun. We can't go wrong. ♫
53.33	♫ My life was lonely and blue. ♫
56.33	♫ Yeah, I was sad as a sailor, ♫
60.33	♫ I was an angry 'un too. ♫
63.33	♫ Then there was you -- appeared when I was entangled with youth and fear, ♫
70.33	♫ and nerves jingle jangled, vermouth and beer were getting me mangled up. ♫
76.33	♫ But then I looked in your eyes ♫
79.33	♫ and I was no more a failure. ♫
82.33	♫ You looked so wacky and wise. ♫
86.33	"♫ And I said, ""Lord, I'm happy, 'cause I'm just a'walking my dog, ♫"
91.33	"♫ catching some sun. We can't go wrong."" ♫"
95.33	♫ Yeah, it's just me and my dog, singing our song, strolling along. ♫
101.33	♫ 'Cause I don't care about your hating and your doubt, ♫
104.33	♫ and I don't care what the politicians spout. ♫
108.33	♫ If you need a companion, why, just go out to the pound, ♫
111.33	♫ and find yourself a hound, and make that doggie proud, ♫
114.33	♫ 'cause that's what it's all about. ♫
121.33	♫ (Dog panting noise) Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. ♫
124.33	♫ My life was tragic and sad. ♫
128.33	♫ I was the archetypal loser. ♫
131.33	♫ I was a pageant gone bad. ♫
135.33	♫ And then there was you -- on time, and wagging your tail ♫
140.33	♫ in the cutest mime that you was in jail. ♫
143.33	"♫ I said, ""Woof, be mine!"" and you gave a wail and then ♫"
149.33	♫ I was no longer alone. ♫
151.33	♫ And I was no more a boozer. ♫
154.33	♫ We'll make the happiest home. ♫
157.33	"♫ And I said, ""Lord, I'm happy, 'cause I’m just a'walking my dog, ♫"
161.33	"♫ singing my song, strolling along."" ♫"
165.33	♫ Yeah, it's just me and my dog, catching some sun. We can't go wrong, ♫
173.33	♫ 'cause I don't care about your hating and your doubt, ♫
175.33	♫ and I don’t care what the politicians spout. ♫
179.33	♫ If you need a companion, why, just go out to the pound, ♫
182.33	♫ and find yourself a hound, and make that doggie proud, ♫
185.33	♫ 'cause that's what it's all about, ♫
188.33	♫ that's what it's all about, ♫
191.33	♫ that's what it's all abou-BOW-WOW-WOW-WOW ♫
195.33	♫ that's what it's all about. ♫
200.33	♫ (Dog panting noise) Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. ♫
202.33	Good dog!
207.33	Thank you.
