12.603	I know a man who soars above the city every night.
18.465	In his dreams, he twirls and swirls
21.459	with his toes kissing the Earth.
24.326	Everything has motion, he claims,
27.14	even a body as paralyzed as his own.
31.982	This man is my father.
36.812	Three years ago, when I found out
38.713	that my father had suffered a severe stroke
41.3	in his brain stem,
43.426	I walked into his room in the ICU
46.9	at the Montreal Neurological Institute
49.884	and found him lying deathly still,
52.527	tethered to a breathing machine.
55.463	Paralysis had closed over his body slowly,
59.894	beginning in his toes, then legs,
61.965	torso, fingers and arms.
64.495	It made its way up his neck,
66.7	cutting off his ability to breathe,
68.905	and stopped just beneath the eyes.
73.382	He never lost consciousness.
75.553	Rather, he watched from within
78.14	as his body shut down,
80.446	limb by limb,
82.583	muscle by muscle.
85.542	In that ICU room, I walked up to my father's body,
90.1	and with a quivering voice and through tears,
93.699	I began reciting the alphabet.
97.112	A, B, C, D, E, F, G,
103.01	H, I, J, K.
107.14	At K, he blinked his eyes.
110.092	I began again.
112.246	A, B, C, D, E, F, G,
116.74	H, I.
118.75	He blinked again at the letter I,
121.888	then at T, then at R, and A:
125.88	Kitra.
127.727	"He said ""Kitra, my beauty, don't cry."
131.685	"This is a blessing."""
136.14	There was no audible voice, but my father
138.795	called out my name powerfully.
141.843	Just 72 hours after his stroke,
144.935	he had already embraced
146.69	the totality of his condition.
150.165	Despite his extreme physical state,
152.665	he was completely present with me,
155.621	guiding, nurturing,
158.253	and being my father as much
160.503	if not more than ever before.
163.739	Locked-in syndrome
165.302	is many people's worst nightmare.
168.703	In French, it's sometimes called
171.111	"""maladie de l'emmur√© vivant."""
173.191	"Literally, ""walled-in-alive disease."""
178.512	For many people, perhaps most,
180.267	paralysis is an unspeakable horror,
183.799	but my father's experience
186.14	losing every system of his body
188.511	was not an experience of feeling trapped,
191.572	but rather of turning the psyche inwards,
195.733	dimming down the external chatter,
198.928	facing the recesses of his own mind,
201.853	and in that place,
203.69	falling in love with life and body anew.
208.47	As a rabbi and spiritual man
211.166	dangling between mind and body, life and death,
215.28	the paralysis opened up a new awareness for him.
219.807	He realized he no longer needed to look
222.221	beyond the corporeal world
225.25	in order to find the divine.
228.499	"""Paradise is in this body."
232.388	"It's in this world,"" he said."
236.15	I slept by my father's side for the first four months,
240.006	tending as much as I could
242.12	to his every discomfort,
244.765	understanding the deep 
244.765	human psychological fear
248.115	of not being able to call out for help.
251.6	My mother, sisters, brother and I,
255.326	we surrounded him in a cocoon of healing.
259.69	We became his mouthpiece,
261.79	spending hours each day reciting the alphabet
265.619	as he whispered back sermons
267.981	and poetry with blinks of his eye.
271.65	His room, it became our temple of healing.
277.104	His bedside became a site for those
279.826	seeking advice and spiritual counsel, and through us,
283.911	my father was able to speak
286.451	and uplift,
288.645	letter by letter,
290.636	blink by blink.
293.1	Everything in our world became slow and tender
296.992	as the din, drama and death of the hospital ward
300.356	faded into the background.
303.86	I want to read to you one of the first things
305.96	that we transcribed in the week following the stroke.
310.201	He composed a letter,
312.581	addressing his synagogue congregation,
315.202	and ended it with the following lines:
318.711	"""When my nape exploded,"
321.19	I entered another dimension:
323.953	inchoate, sub-planetary, protozoan.
328.61	Universes are opened and closed continually.
333.199	There are many when low,
335.258	who stop growing.
337.463	Last week, I was brought so low,
339.567	but I felt the hand of my father around me,
343.002	"and my father brought me back."""
346.422	When we weren't his voice,
348.667	we were his legs and arms.
352	I moved them like I know I would have wanted
354.652	my own arms and legs to be moved
357.249	were they still for all the hours of the day.
361.141	I remember I'd hold his fingers near my face,
365.124	bending each joint to keep it soft and limber.
369.41	I'd ask him again and again
371.761	to visualize the motion,
374.258	to watch from within as the finger curled
377.779	and extended, and to move along with it
381.851	in his mind.
384.562	Then, one day, from the corner of my eye,
386.575	I saw his body slither like a snake,
390.298	an involuntary spasm passing through the course
393.603	of his limbs.
395.89	At first, I thought it was my own hallucination,
398.105	having spent so much time tending to this one body,
401.66	so desperate to see anything react on its own.
406.32	But he told me he felt tingles,
408.98	sparks of electricity flickering on and off
412.515	just beneath the surface of the skin.
416.272	The following week, he began ever so slightly
419.579	to show muscle resistance.
422.335	Connections were being made.
424.94	Body was slowly and gently reawakening,
430.164	limb by limb, muscle by muscle,
433.71	twitch by twitch.
436.641	As a documentary photographer,
439.278	I felt the need to photograph
441.08	each of his first movements
443.28	like a mother with her newborn.
445.93	I photographed him taking his first unaided breath,
450.434	the celebratory moment after he showed
453.213	muscle resistance for the very first time,
457.22	the new adapted technologies that allowed him
459.93	to gain more and more independence.
463.81	I photographed the care and the love
465.823	that surrounded him.
476.89	But my photographs only told the outside story
480.304	of a man lying in a hospital bed
483.616	attached to a breathing machine.
485.27	I wasn't able to portray his story from within,
488.892	and so I began to search for a new visual language,
492.215	one which strived to express the ephemeral quality
495.513	of his spiritual experience.
518.026	Finally, I want to share with you
520.284	a video from a series that I've been working on
523.642	that tries to express the slow, in-between existence
526.91	that my father has experienced.
529.62	As he began to regain his ability to breathe,
533.17	I started recording his thoughts,
535.802	and so the voice that you hear in this video
537.726	is his voice.
540.336	(Video) Ronnie Cahana: You have to believe
543.418	you're paralyzed
546.152	to play the part
548.907	of a quadriplegic.
554.14	I don't.
556.108	In my mind,
558.694	and in my dreams
561.456	every night
564.296	I Chagall-man float
569.211	over the city
572.339	twirl and swirl
575.556	with my toes kissing the floor.
583.475	I know nothing about the statement
590.382	of man without motion.
596.175	Everything has motion.
599.799	The heart pumps.
603.15	The body heaves.
607.446	The mouth moves.
612.16	We never stagnate.
616.231	Life triumphs up and down.
623.055	Kitra Cahana: For most of us,
625.131	our muscles begin to twitch and move
627.865	long before we are conscious,
630.373	but my father tells me his privilege
633.29	is living on the far periphery
635.469	of the human experience.
638.472	Like an astronaut who sees a perspective
641.104	that very few of us will ever get to share,
644.322	he wonders and watches as he takes
647.428	his first breaths
649.305	and dreams about crawling back home.
653.344	So begins life at 57, he says.
657.123	A toddler has no attitude in its being,
660.622	but a man insists on his world every day.
666.325	Few of us will ever have to face physical limitations
669.97	to the degree that my father has,
672.928	but we will all have moments of paralysis
676.079	in our lives.
678.44	I know I frequently confront walls
681.658	that feel completely unscalable,
684.897	but my father insists
687.157	that there are no dead ends.
690.03	Instead, he invites me into his space of co-healing
695.24	to give the very best of myself, and for him
698.844	to give the very best of himself to me.
702.274	Paralysis was an opening for him.
705.311	It was an opportunity to emerge,
707.662	to rekindle life force,
709.856	to sit still long enough with himself
711.89	so as to fall in love with the full continuum
715.2	of creation.
717.494	Today, my father is no longer locked in.
721.476	He moves his neck with ease,
724.637	has had his feeding peg removed,
727.368	breathes with his own lungs,
730.15	speaks slowly with his own quiet voice,
733.634	and works every day
735.938	to gain more movement in his paralyzed body.
741.148	But the work will never be finished.
743.499	"As he says, ""I'm living in a broken world,"
748.212	"and there is holy work to do."""
751.243	Thank you.
753.263	(Applause)
