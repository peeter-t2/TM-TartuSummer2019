13.401	Fifty-four percent of the world's population
16.955	lives in our cities.
19.536	In developing countries,
21.181	one third of that population
23.461	is living in slums.
26.408	Seventy-five percent of global energy consumption
31.04	occurs in our cities,
34.09	and 80 percent of gas emissions
36.599	that cause global warming
38.354	come from our cities.
41.392	So things that you and I might think about
44.417	as global problems,
46.532	like climate change, the energy crisis
49.18	or poverty,
50.842	are really, in many ways, city problems.
55.702	They will not be solved
57.564	unless people who live in cities,
60.582	like most of us,
62.501	actually start doing a better job,
65.293	because right now, we are 
65.293	not doing a very good one.
69.249	And that becomes very clear
72.585	when we look into three aspects of city life:
76.479	first, our citizens' willingness to engage
80.605	with democratic institutions;
83.417	second, our cities' ability to really include
88.221	all of their residents;
90.763	and lastly, our own ability
93.94	to live fulfilling and happy lives.
98.405	When it comes to engagement,
100.184	the data is very clear.
103.114	Voter turnout around the world
105.195	peaked in the late '80s,
107.636	and it has been declining at a pace
109.481	that we have never seen before,
112.543	and if those numbers are bad at the national level,
116.138	at the level of our cities,
118.147	they are just dismal.
121.236	In the last two years,
122.83	two of the world's most consolidated,
125.331	oldest democracies, the U.S. and France,
129.166	held nationwide municipal elections.
132.971	In France, voter turnout hit a record low.
136.871	Almost 40 percent of voters decided
140.933	not to show up.
143.621	In the U.S., the numbers were even scarier.
146.71	In some American cities,
148.987	voter turnout was close to five percent.
153.981	I'll let that sink in for a second.
155.77	We're talking about democratic cities
158.188	in which 95 percent of people
161.563	decided that it was not important
163.981	to elect their leaders.
166.726	The city of L.A., a city of four million people,
170.38	elected its mayor with just a bit over 200,000 votes.
175.309	That was the lowest turnout the city had seen
177.795	in 100 years.
180.676	Right here, in my city of Rio,
183.72	in spite of mandatory voting,
186.794	almost 30 percent of the voting population
190.292	chose to either annul their votes
192.857	or stay home and pay a fine
195.489	in the last mayoral elections.
198.82	When it comes to inclusiveness,
201.139	our cities are not the best cases of success either,
204.244	and again, you don't need to look very far
207.134	in order to find proof of that.
208.889	The city of Rio is incredibly unequal.
213.388	This is Leblon.
215.357	Leblon is the city's richest neighborhood.
218.461	And this is Complexo do Alemão.
220.9	This is where over 70,000
223.164	of the city's poorest residents live.
226.415	Leblon has an HDI, a Human Development Index,
230.001	of .967.
233.39	That is higher than Norway, Switzerland
237.211	or Sweden.
239.452	Complexo do Alemão has an HDI of .711.
243.181	It sits somewhere in between the HDI
246.111	of Algeria and Gabon.
249.328	So Rio, like so many cities across the global South,
254.109	is a place where you can go from northern Europe
257.08	to sub-Saharan Africa
258.98	in the space of 30 minutes.
261.984	If you drive, that is.
263.693	If you take public transit, it's about two hours.
268.44	And lastly, perhaps most importantly,
272.299	cities, with the incredible wealth
274.78	of relations that they enable,
277.282	could be the ideal places for human happiness
281.16	to flourish.
282.562	We like being around people.
284.987	We are social animals.
287.383	Instead, countries where urbanization
290.006	has already peaked seem to be the very countries
294.228	in which cities have stopped making us happy.
298.88	The United States population has suffered
301.484	from a general decrease in happiness
304.464	for the past three decades,
307.666	and the main reason is this.
310.64	The American way of building cities
313.542	has caused good quality public spaces
316.253	to virtually disappear in many,
318.237	many American cities,
319.992	and as a result, they have seen
321.989	a decline of relations,
324.544	of the things that make us happy.
326.748	Many studies show an increase
328.795	in solitude and a decrease in solidarity,
333.486	honesty, and social and civic participation.
338.142	So how do we start building cities
341.506	that make us care?
344.116	Cities that value their most important asset:
348.75	the incredible diversity
351.349	of the people who live in them?
353.555	Cities that make us happy?
357.212	Well, I believe that if we want to change
359.719	what our cities look like,
362.271	then we really have to change
364.961	the decision-making processes
367.504	that have given us the results 
367.504	that we have right now.
371.328	We need a participation revolution,
374.5	and we need it fast.
377.374	The idea of voting as our 
377.374	only exercise in citizenship
382.712	does not make sense anymore.
385.67	People are tired of only being treated
388.199	as empowered individuals every few years
392.372	when it's time to delegate that power
395.522	to someone else.
397.897	If the protests that swept Brazil
400.842	in June 2013 have taught us anything,
405.814	it's that every time we try
408.649	to exercise our power
411.101	outside of an electoral context,
413.958	we are beaten up, humiliated or arrested.
419.212	And this needs to change,
422.419	because when it does,
424.633	not only will people re-engage
426.894	with the structures of representation,
429.38	but also complement these structures
432.654	with direct, effective, and 
432.654	collective decision making,
439.572	decision making of the kind
441.496	that attacks inequality
443.542	by its very inclusive nature,
446.782	decision making of the kind
448.605	that can change our cities
450.821	into better places for us to live.
453.937	But there is a catch, obviously:
457.416	Enabling widespread participation
460.157	and redistributing power
462.115	can be a logistical nightmare,
464.84	and there's where technology can play
467.129	an incredibly helpful role,
469.306	by making it easier for people to organize,
472.388	communicate and make decisions
474.452	without having to be in the same room
476.69	at the same time.
478.952	Unfortunately for us,
480.853	when it comes to fostering democratic processes,
483.879	our city governments have not used technology
486.964	to its full potential.
489.942	So far, most city governments have been effective
493.159	at using tech to turn citizens into human sensors
497.742	who serve authorities with data on the city:
501.45	potholes, fallen trees or broken lamps.
505.456	They have also, to a lesser extent,
507.886	invited people to participate in improving
511.486	the outcome of decisions
513.1	that were already made for them,
516.412	just like my mom when I was eight
517.987	and she told me that I had a choice:
519.753	I had to be in bed by 8 p.m.,
521.33	but I could choose my pink
521.33	pajamas or my blue pajamas.
525.243	That's not participation,
527.482	and in fact, governments have not been very good
531.227	at using technology to enable participation
534.13	on what matters —
536.08	the way we allocate our budget,
538.393	the way we occupy our land,
540.615	and the way we manage our natural resources.
544.164	Those are the kinds of decisions
546.278	that can actually impact global problems
549.158	that manifest themselves in our cities.
552.98	The good news is,
554.506	and I do have good news to share with you,
556.369	we don't need to wait for governments to do this.
560.666	I have reason to believe
562.636	that it's possible for citizens to build
565.224	their own structures of participation.
569.757	Three years ago, I cofounded an organization
572.558	called Meu Rio,
575.045	and we make it easier for people in the city of Rio
578.125	to organize around causes and places
581.704	that they care about in their own city,
584.301	and have an impact on those causes and places
586.99	every day.
589.318	In these past three years, Meu Rio grew
592.06	to a network of 160,000 citizens of Rio.
597.928	About 40 percent of those 
597.928	members are young people
601.833	aged 20 to 29.
604.072	That is one in every 15 young people
608.996	of that age in Rio today.
612.828	Amongst our members is this adorable little girl,
616.46	Bia, to your right,
618.509	and Bia was just 11 years old
621.636	when she started a campaign using one of our tools
624.572	to save her model public school from demolition.
628.161	Her school actually ranks among the best
630.253	public schools in the country,
632.525	and it was going to be demolished
634.257	by the Rio de Janeiro state government
636.811	to build, I kid you not,
638.701	a parking lot for the World Cup
641.524	right before the event happened.
643.87	Bia started a campaign, and we even watched
646.364	her school 24/7 through webcam monitoring,
649.747	and many months afterwards,
651.761	the government changed their minds.
653.392	Bia's school stayed in place.
656.316	There's also Jovita.
658.487	She's an amazing woman whose daughter
660.759	went missing about 10 years ago,
663.42	and since then, she has been looking
665.855	for her daughter.
667.039	In that process, she found out
669.815	that first, she was not alone.
672.368	In the last year alone, 2013,
674.956	6,000 people disappeared
676.83	in the state of Rio.
678.706	But she also found out that in spite of that,
681.334	Rio had no centralized intelligence system
685.285	for solving missing persons cases.
688.59	In other Brazilian cities, those systems
691.16	have helped solve up to 80 percent
693.55	of missing persons cases.
695.586	She started a campaign,
697.329	and after the secretary of 
697.329	security got 16,000 emails
701.311	from people asking him to do this,
704.124	he responded, and started to build a police unit
707.106	specializing in those cases.
708.93	It was open to the public at the end of last month,
712.286	and Jovita was there
714.137	giving interviews and being very fancy.
717.161	And then, there is Leandro.
719	Leandro is an amazing guy
720.723	in a slum in Rio,
722.639	and he created a recycling project in the slum.
726.062	At the end of last year, December 16,
728.512	he received an eviction order
730.604	by the Rio de Janeiro state government
732.584	giving him two weeks to leave the space
736.504	that he had been using for two years.
740.244	The plan was to hand it over to a developer,
742.809	who planned to turn it into a construction site.
746.229	Leandro started a campaign using one of our tools,
749.297	the Pressure Cooker,
750.875	the same one that Bia and Jovita used,
753.214	and the state government changed their minds
756.27	before Christmas Eve.
759.536	These stories make me happy,
762.608	but not just because they have happy endings.
765.655	They make me happy because they are
768.401	happy beginnings.
771.1	The teacher and parent community at Bia's school
773.519	is looking for other ways they could improve
775.475	that space even further.
778.952	Leandro has ambitious plans
780.663	to take his model to other
780.663	low-income communities in Rio,
783.616	and Jovita is volunteering at the police unit
786.827	that she helped created.
789.667	Bia, Jovita and Leandro
792.415	are living examples of something
794.475	that citizens and city 
794.475	governments around the world
798.057	need to know:
800.461	We are ready.
803.788	As citizens, we are ready
806.716	to decide on our common destinies,
810.271	because we know that the way we distribute power
814.29	says a lot about how we actually value everyone,
819.13	and because we know
821.36	that enabling and participating in local politics
824.855	is a sign that we truly care
826.978	about our relations to one another,
829.168	and we are ready to do this
830.89	in cities around the world right now.
834.907	With the Our Cities network,
837.303	the Meu Rio team
838.64	hopes to share what we have learned
840.666	with other people who want to create
842.622	similar initiatives in their own cities.
845.884	We have already started doing it in São Paulo
848.441	with incredible results,
850.137	and want to take it to cities around the world
853.444	through a network of citizen-centric,
856.369	citizen-led organizations
858.746	that can inspire us,
860.932	challenge us, and remind us to demand
864.396	real participation in our city lives.
869.447	It is up to us
871.409	to decide whether we want schools
873.894	or parking lots,
876.18	community-driven recycling projects
878.513	or construction sites,
881.116	loneliness or solidarity, cars or buses,
883.536	and it is our responsibility to do that now,
887.235	for ourselves, for our families,
890.659	for the people who make our lives worth living,
894.753	and for the incredible creativity,
897.62	beauty, and wonder that make our cities,
901.027	in spite of all of their problems,
903.614	the greatest invention of our time.
907.33	Obrigado. Thank you.
909.81	(Applause)
