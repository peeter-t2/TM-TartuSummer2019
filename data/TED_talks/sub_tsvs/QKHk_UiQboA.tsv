12.996	Tonight, I'm going to try to make the case
15.073	that inviting a loved one, a friend
15.073	or even a stranger
19.699	to record a meaningful interview with you
22.13	just might turn out to be one of the most 
22.13	important moments in that person's life,
26.536	and in yours.
29.481	When I was 22 years old,
29.481	I was lucky enough to find my calling
32.825	when I fell into making radio stories.
35.285	At almost the exact same time,
37.719	I found out that my dad,
37.719	who I was very, very close to, was gay.
42.688	I was taken completely by surprise.
44.99	We were a very tight-knit family,
47.498	and I was crushed.
49.889	At some point, in one
49.889	of our strained conversations,
52.234	my dad mentioned the Stonewall riots.
54.904	He told me that one night in 1969,
58.178	a group of young black
58.178	and Latino drag queens
60.883	fought back against the police
60.883	at a gay bar in Manhattan
64.529	called the Stonewall Inn,
66.549	and how this sparked
66.549	the modern gay rights movement.
70.078	It was an amazing story,
70.078	and it piqued my interest.
73.417	So I decided to pick up my tape 
73.417	recorder and find out more.
77.628	With the help of a young archivist
77.628	named Michael Shirker,
81.804	we tracked down all
81.804	of the people we could find
84.381	who had been at
84.381	the Stonewall Inn that night.
87.817	Recording these interviews,
89.814	I saw how the microphone
89.814	gave me the license
92.043	to go places I otherwise
92.043	never would have gone
94.779	and talk to people I might not
94.779	otherwise ever have spoken to.
98.912	I had the privilege of getting to know
100.754	some of the most amazing,
100.754	fierce and courageous human beings
104.648	I had ever met.
106.83	It was the first time
106.83	the story of Stonewall
108.934	had been told to a national audience.
110.986	I dedicated the program to my dad,
113.249	it changed my relationship with him,
113.249	and it changed my life.
120.181	Over the next 15 years,
120.181	I made many more radio documentaries,
123.617	working to shine a light on people
123.617	who are rarely heard from in the media.
127.681	Over and over again,
129.26	I'd see how this simple act
129.26	of being interviewed
131.86	could mean so much to people,
134.02	particularly those who had been told
134.02	that their stories didn't matter.
137.711	I could literally see
137.711	people's back straighten
140.08	as they started to speak
140.08	into the microphone.
142.866	In 1998, I made a documentary
142.866	about the last flophouse hotels
147.371	on the Bowery in Manhattan.
149.762	Guys stayed up in these
149.762	cheap hotels for decades.
152.432	They lived in cubicles
152.432	the size of prison cells
154.824	covered with chicken wire
156.124	so you couldn't jump
156.124	from one room into the next.
159.088	Later, I wrote a book on the men
159.088	with the photographer Harvey Wang.
163.067	I remember walking into a flophouse
163.067	with an early version of the book
167.491	and showing one of the guys his page.
170.079	He stood there staring at it in silence,
172.354	then he grabbed the book out of my hand
174.653	and started running down
174.653	the long, narrow hallway
178.136	holding it over his head
179.645	"shouting, ""I exist! I exist."""
184.01	(Applause)
188.863	"In many ways, ""I exist"" became"
188.863	the clarion call for StoryCorps,
192.694	this crazy idea that I had
192.694	a dozen years ago.
196.27	The thought was to take
196.27	documentary work
198.499	and turn it on its head.
200.356	Traditionally, broadcast documentary
202.61	has been about recording interviews
202.61	to create a work of art or entertainment
206.696	or education that is seen or heard
206.696	by a whole lot of people,
210.944	but I wanted to try something
212.325	where the interview itself
212.325	was the purpose of this work,
215.473	and see if we could give many,
215.473	many, many people the chance
218.445	to be listened to in this way.
221.069	So in Grand Central Terminal 11 years ago,
224.119	we built a booth where anyone 
224.119	can come to honor someone else
228.492	by interviewing them about their life.
231.503	You come to this booth and you're met
231.503	by a facilitator who brings you inside.
235.334	You sit across from, say, your grandfather
237.911	for close to an hour
237.911	and you listen and you talk.
240.953	Many people think of it as,
240.953	if this was to be our last conversation,
244.645	what would I want to ask of
244.645	and say to this person
247.64	who means so much to me?
249.916	At the end of the session,
249.916	you walk away with a copy of the interview
253.203	and another copy goes
253.203	to the American Folklife Center
255.861	at the Library of Congress
258.119	so that your great-great-great-grandkids
258.119	can someday get to know your grandfather
262.175	through his voice and story.
265.548	So we open this booth
265.548	in one of the busiest places in the world
268.705	and invite people to have this
268.705	incredibly intimate conversation
272.188	with another human being.
273.419	I had no idea if it would work,
273.419	but from the very beginning, it did.
278.225	People treated the experience
278.225	with incredible respect,
281.104	and amazing conversations happened inside.
284.471	I want to play just one animated excerpt
287.002	from an interview recorded
287.002	at that original Grand Central Booth.
290.763	This is 12-year-old Joshua Littman
290.763	interviewing his mother, Sarah.
295.291	Josh has Asperger's syndrome.
297.497	As you may know, kids with Asperger's
297.497	are incredibly smart
300.562	but have a tough time socially.
302.721	They usually have obsessions.
304.37	In Josh's case, it's with animals,
306.576	so this is Josh talking with his mom Sarah
309.199	at Grand Central nine years ago.
312.499	(Video) Josh Littman:
312.499	From a scale of one to 10,
314.776	do you think your life would be
314.776	different without animals?
317.758	Sarah Littman: I think it would be
317.758	an eight without animals,
320.565	because they add so much pleasure to life.
322.699	JL: How else do you think your life
322.699	would be different without them?
325.898	SL: I could do without things
325.898	like cockroaches and snakes.
328.617	JL: Well, I'm okay with snakes
328.617	as long as they're not venomous
331.518	or constrict you or anything.
332.919	SL: Yeah, I'm not a big snake person --
334.778	JL: But cockroach is just
334.778	the insect we love to hate.
337.288	SL: Yeah, it really is.
338.821	JL: Have you ever thought
338.821	you couldn't cope with having a child?
341.955	SL: I remember when you were a baby,
341.955	you had really bad colic,
345.345	so you would just cry and cry.
346.948	JL: What's colic?
346.948	SL: It's when you get this stomach ache
350.105	and all you do is scream
350.105	for, like, four hours.
352.59	JL: Even louder than Amy does?
354.563	SL: You were pretty loud,
354.563	but Amy's was more high-pitched.
357.907	JL: I think it feels like everyone
357.907	seems to like Amy more,
361.111	like she's the perfect little angel.
363.781	SL: Well, I can understand
363.781	why you think that people like Amy more,
367.644	and I'm not saying it's because
367.644	of your Asperger's syndrome,
370.483	but being friendly comes easily to Amy,
373.487	whereas I think for you
373.487	it's more difficult,
375.902	but the people who take the time
375.902	to get to know you love you so much.
379.942	JL: Like Ben or Eric or Carlos?
379.942	SL: Yeah --
382.357	JL: Like I have better quality friends
382.357	but less quantity? (Laughter)
386.838	SL: I wouldn't judge
386.838	the quality, but I think --
389.119	JL: I mean, first it was like, Amy
389.119	loved Claudia, then she hated Claudia,
392.887	she loved Claudia, then she hated Claudia.
394.914	SL: Part of that's a girl thing, honey.
396.802	The important thing for you
396.802	is that you have a few very good friends,
400.134	and really that's what you need in life.
402.16	JL: Did I turn out to be the son
402.16	you wanted when I was born?
406.409	Did I meet your expectations?
409.311	SL: You've exceeded
409.311	my expectations, sweetie,
412.074	because, sure, you have these fantasies
412.074	of what your child's going to be like,
416.834	but you have made me grow
416.834	so much as a parent, because you think --
420.727	JL: Well, I was the one
420.727	who made you a parent.
422.888	SL: You were the one who made me a parent.
422.888	That's a good point. (Laughter)
426.375	But also because you think differently
428.199	from what they tell you
428.199	in the parenting books,
431.102	I really had to learn to think
431.102	outside of the box with you,
434.562	and it's made me much more creative
434.562	as a parent and as a person,
439.368	and I'll always thank you for that.
441.036	JL: And that helped when Amy was born?
442.966	SL: And that helped when Amy was born,
442.966	but you are so incredibly special to me
447.8	and I'm so lucky to have you as my son.
451.163	(Applause)
458.98	David Isay: After this story
458.98	ran on public radio,
461.287	Josh received hundreds of letters
463.051	telling him what an amazing kid he was.
465.373	His mom, Sarah, bound them
465.373	together in a book,
467.602	and when Josh got picked on at school,
467.602	they would read the letters together.
471.648	I just want to acknowledge
471.648	that two of my heroes
473.915	are here with us tonight.
475.218	Sarah Littman and her son Josh,
475.218	who is now an honors student in college.
480.019	(Applause)
483.809	You know, a lot of people talk about
483.809	crying when they hear StoryCorps stories,
487.691	and it's not because they're sad.
489.638	Most of them aren't.
490.962	I think it's because you're hearing
490.962	something authentic and pure
494.015	at this moment,
494.015	when sometimes it's hard to tell
496.406	what's real and what's an advertisement.
499.402	It's kind of the anti-reality TV.
501.793	Nobody comes to StoryCorps to get rich.
503.906	Nobody comes to get famous.
505.787	It's simply an act of generosity and love.
508.991	So many of these are just everyday people
511.243	talking about lives lived with kindness,
511.243	courage, decency and dignity,
516.375	and when you hear that kind of story,
518.372	it can sometimes feel
518.372	like you're walking on holy ground.
522.755	So this experiment 
522.755	in Grand Central worked,
525.26	and we expanded across the country.
527.65	Today, more than 100,000 people
527.65	in all 50 states
530.863	in thousands of cities
530.863	and towns across America
533.719	have recorded StoryCorps interviews.
536.064	It's now the largest single collection
536.064	of human voices ever gathered.
540.987	(Applause)
546.815	We've hired and trained
546.815	hundreds of facilitators
549.253	to help guide people
549.253	through the experience.
551.969	Most serve a year or two with StoryCorps
554.384	traveling the country,
554.384	gathering the wisdom of humanity.
557.821	They call it bearing witness,
559.98	and if you ask them,
561.385	all of the facilitators will tell you
561.385	that the most important thing
564.659	they've learned from being present
564.659	during these interviews
567.527	is that people are basically good.
570.963	And I think for the first years
570.963	of StoryCorps, you could argue
573.921	that there was some kind
573.921	of a selection bias happening,
576.557	but after tens of thousands of interviews
576.557	with every kind of person
579.833	in every part of the country --
581.482	rich, poor, five years old to 105,
	across the political spectrum --
589.063	you have to think that maybe these guys
589.063	are actually onto something.
593.277	I've also learned so much
593.277	from these interviews.
596.568	I've learned about the poetry
596.568	and the wisdom and the grace
599.772	that can be found in the words
599.772	of people all around us
602.512	when we simply take the time to listen,
605.809	like this interview
609.042	between a betting clerk in Brooklyn
609.042	named Danny Perasa
612.38	who brought his wife Annie to StoryCorps
612.38	to talk about his love for her.
618.632	(Audio) Danny Perasa: You see,
618.632	the thing of it is,
620.974	I always feel guilty when I say
620.974	"""I love you"" to you."
623.45	And I say it so often.
623.45	I say it to remind you
626.358	that as dumpy as I am,
626.358	it's coming from me.
629.214	It's like hearing a beautiful song
629.214	from a busted old radio,
632.668	and it's nice of you to keep
632.668	the radio around the house.
635.295	Annie Perasa: If I don't have a note
635.295	on the kitchen table,
638.101	I think there's something wrong.
639.688	You write a love letter
639.688	to me every morning.
641.742	DP: Well, the only thing
641.742	that could possibly be wrong
644.271	is I couldn't find a silly pen.
645.804	AP: To my princess:
646.831	The weather outside today
646.831	is extremely rainy.
649.048	I'll call you at 11:20 in the morning.
651.001	DP: It's a romantic weather report.
652.817	AP: And I love you.
652.817	I love you. I love you.
655.567	DP: When a guy is happily married,
655.567	no matter what happens at work,
658.666	no matter what happens
658.666	in the rest of the day,
660.823	there's a shelter when you get home,
662.544	there's a knowledge knowing
662.544	that you can hug somebody
665.097	without them throwing you downstairs
665.097	"and saying, ""Get your hands off me."""
668.644	Being married is like having
668.644	a color television set.
671.271	You never want to go back
671.271	to black and white.
673.478	(Laughter)
676.82	DI: Danny was about five feet tall
678.956	with crossed eyes
678.956	and one single snaggletooth,
682.369	but Danny Perasa had
682.369	more romance in his little pinky
686.061	than all of Hollywood's
686.061	leading men put together.
689.174	What else have I learned?
691.077	I've learned about the almost
691.077	unimaginable capacity
693.979	for the human spirit to forgive.
696.162	I've learned about resilience
696.162	and I've learned about strength.
699.807	Like an interview with Oshea Israel
699.807	and Mary Johnson.
703.15	When Oshea was a teenager,
703.15	he murdered Mary's only son,
707.701	Laramiun Byrd, in a gang fight.
710.186	A dozen years later, Mary went to prison
712.786	to meet Oshea and find out
712.786	who this person was
715.526	who had taken her son's life.
718.475	Slowly and remarkably,
718.475	they became friends,
721.261	and when he was finally released
721.261	from the penitentiary,
723.955	Oshea actually moved in next door to Mary.
727.321	This is just a short excerpt
727.321	of a conversation they had
730.526	soon after Oshea was freed.
734.079	(Video) Mary Johnson: My natural son
734.079	is no longer here.
737.051	I didn't see him graduate,
737.051	and now you're going to college.
740.835	I'll have the opportunity
740.835	to see you graduate.
744.132	I didn't see him get married.
746.593	Hopefully one day, I'll be able
746.593	to experience that with you.
750.502	Oshea Israel: Just to hear you
750.502	say those things and to be
753.199	in my life in the manner
753.199	in which you are is my motivation.
756.859	It motivates me to make sure
756.859	that I stay on the right path.
761.616	You still believe in me,
763.543	and the fact that you can do it
763.543	despite how much pain I caused you,
767.119	it's amazing.
769.209	MJ: I know it's not an easy thing
769.209	to be able to share our story together,
775.106	even with us sitting here
775.106	looking at each other right now.
777.869	I know it's not an easy thing,
777.869	so I admire that you can do this.
783.616	OI: I love you, lady.
783.616	MJ: I love you too, son.
792.156	(Applause)
798.372	DI: And I've been reminded countless times
798.372	of the courage and goodness of people,
803.526	and how the arc of history
803.526	truly does bend towards justice.
808.588	Like the story of Alexis Martinez,
808.588	who was born Arthur Martinez
813.069	in the Harold Ickes projects in Chicago.
815.693	In the interview, she talks
815.693	with her daughter Lesley
818.526	about joining a gang as a young man,
820.894	and later in life transitioning
820.894	into the woman she was always meant to be.
825.724	This is Alexis and her daughter Lesley.
828.223	(Audio) Alexis Martinez: One of the most
828.223	difficult things for me was
831.482	I was always afraid that
831.482	I wouldn't be allowed
834.408	to be in my granddaughters' lives,
837.287	and you blew that completely
837.287	out of the water,
839.585	you and your husband.
840.909	One of the fruits of that is,
840.909	in my relationship with my granddaughters,
844.369	they fight with each other sometimes
844.369	over whether I'm he or she.
847.946	Lesley Martinez: But they're free
847.946	to talk about it.
850.433	AM: They're free to talk about it,
850.433	but that, to me, is a miracle.
853.489	LM: You don't have to apologize.
853.489	You don't have to tiptoe.
856.791	We're not going to cut you off,
856.791	and that's something I've always
861.372	wanted you to just know,
861.372	that you're loved.
864.337	AM: You know, I live this every day now.
866.682	I walk down the streets as a woman,
866.682	and I really am at peace with who I am.
871.806	I mean, I wish I had a softer voice maybe,
874.46	but now I walk in love
874.46	and I try to live that way every day.
883.562	DI: Now I walk in love.
886.906	I'm going to tell you
886.906	a secret about StoryCorps.
889.808	It takes some courage
889.808	to have these conversations.
893.193	StoryCorps speaks to our mortality.
895.584	Participants know this recording
895.584	will be heard long after they're gone.
899.601	There's a hospice doctor named Ira Byock
902.285	who has worked closely with us
902.285	on recording interviews
904.829	with people who are dying.
906.286	He wrote a book called
906.286	"""The Four Things That Matter Most"""
909.051	about the four things you want to say
909.051	to the most important people in your life
912.882	before they or you die:
915.924	thank you, I love you,
918.455	forgive me, I forgive you.
921.682	They're just about the most powerful words
921.682	we can say to one another,
925.212	and often that's what happens
925.212	in a StoryCorps booth.
928.718	It's a chance to have a sense of closure
928.718	with someone you care about --
932.095	no regrets, nothing left unsaid.
934.917	And it's hard and it takes courage,
938.354	but that's why we're alive, right?
943.299	So, the TED Prize.
945.802	When I first heard from TED
945.802	and Chris a few months ago
948.779	about the possibility of the Prize,
948.779	I was completely floored.
952.615	They asked me to come up
952.615	with a very brief wish for humanity,
956.186	no more than 50 words.
957.95	So I thought about it,
957.95	I wrote my 50 words,
960.694	and a few weeks later,
960.694	"Chris called and said, ""Go for it."""
965.381	So here is my wish:
968.329	that you will help us
971.278	take everything we've learned
971.278	through StoryCorps
974.018	and bring it to the world
976.781	so that anyone anywhere
976.781	can easily record a meaningful interview
980.798	with another human being
980.798	which will then be archived for history.
985.715	How are we going to do that? With this.
990.393	We're fast moving into a future
990.393	where everyone in the world
994.071	will have access to one of these,
996.114	and it has powers I never
996.114	could have imagined 11 years ago
999.945	when I started StoryCorps.
1001.895	It has a microphone,
1003.358	it can tell you how to do things,
1005.669	and it can send audio files.
1008.2	Those are the key ingredients.
1010.522	So the first part of the wish
1010.522	is already underway.
1013.726	Over the past couple of months,
1015.305	the team at StoryCorps
1015.305	has been working furiously
1018.3	to create an app that will bring
1018.3	StoryCorps out of our booths
1021.76	so that it can be experienced
1021.76	by anyone, anywhere, anytime.
1027.193	Remember, StoryCorps has always
1027.193	been two people and a facilitator
1030.874	helping them record their conversation,
1030.874	which is preserved forever,
1034.839	but at this very moment,
1036.887	we're releasing a public beta version
1036.887	of the StoryCorps app.
1040.533	The app is a digital facilitator
1040.533	that walks you through
1043.72	the StoryCorps interview process,
1046.105	helps you pick questions,
1047.777	and gives you all the tips you need
1049.867	to record a meaningful
1049.867	StoryCorps interview,
1052.676	and then with one tap upload it 
1052.676	to our archive at the Library of Congress.
1058.197	That's the easy part, the technology.
1061.337	The real challenge is up to you:
1063.715	to take this tool and figure out
1063.715	how we can use it
1066.913	all across America and around the world,
1069.878	so that instead of recording
1069.878	thousands of StoryCorps interviews a year,
1073.462	we could potentially record
1073.462	tens of thousands
1076.232	or hundreds of thousands
1078.188	or maybe even more.
1081.355	Imagine, for example,
1081.355	a national homework assignment
1085.093	where every high school student
1085.093	studying U.S. history across the country
1089.087	records an interview
1089.087	with an elder over Thanksgiving,
1091.989	so that in one single weekend
1094.892	an entire generation of American lives
1094.892	and experiences are captured.
1099.977	(Applause)
1107.812	Or imagine mothers on opposite
1107.812	sides of a conflict somewhere in the world
1111.354	sitting down not to talk
1111.354	about that conflict
1114.976	but to find out who they are as people,
1117.173	and in doing so,
1117.173	begin to build bonds of trust;
1121.128	or that someday it becomes
1121.128	a tradition all over the world
1124.014	that people are honored
1124.014	with a StoryCorps interview
1126.522	on their 75th birthday;
1128.765	or that people in your community
1131.041	go into retirement homes or hospitals
1131.041	or homeless shelters or even prisons
1136.195	armed with this app to honor the people
1136.195	least heard in our society
1139.725	and ask them who they are,
1139.725	what they've learned in life,
1142.711	and how they want to be remembered.
1145.172	(Applause)
1152.947	Ten years ago, I recorded
1152.947	a StoryCorps interview with my dad
1156.224	who was a psychiatrist,
1156.224	and became a well-known gay activist.
1161.019	This is the picture
1161.019	of us at that interview.
1164.456	I never thought about that recording
1164.456	until a couple of years ago,
1167.637	when my dad, who seemed
1167.637	to be in perfect health
1170.632	and was still seeing patients
1173.233	was diagnosed with cancer.
1175.996	He passed away very suddenly
1175.996	a few days later.
1179.386	It was June 28, 2012,
1181.661	the anniversary of the Stonewall riots.
1186.041	I listened to that interview
1186.041	for the first time at three in the morning
1189.398	on the day that he died.
1191.126	I have a couple of young kids at home,
1193.123	and I knew that the only way
1193.123	they were going to get to know this person
1196.582	who was such a towering figure in my life
1196.582	would be through that session.
1201.428	I thought I couldn't believe in StoryCorps
1201.428	any more deeply than I did,
1205.173	but it was at that moment
1206.961	that I fully and viscerally grasped
1206.961	the importance of making these recordings.
1211.82	Every day, people come up to me
1213.913	"and say, ""I wish I had interviewed"
1213.913	my father or my grandmother or my brother,
1218.074	"but I waited too long."""
1220.342	Now, no one has to wait anymore.
1222.478	At this moment,
1224.158	when so much of how we communicate
1224.158	is fleeting and inconsequential,
1227.7	join us in creating this digital archive
1230.197	of conversations that are
1230.197	enduring and important.
1234.514	Help us create this gift to our children,
1237.344	this testament to who
1237.344	we are as human beings.
1241.342	I hope you'll help us make
1241.342	this wish come true.
1245.268	Interview a family member, a friend
1245.268	or even a stranger.
1249.779	Together, we can create an archive
1249.779	of the wisdom of humanity,
1256.069	and maybe in doing so,
1257.703	we'll learn to listen a little more
1257.703	and shout a little less.
1261.665	Maybe these conversations will remind us
1261.665	what's really important.
1266.193	And maybe, just maybe,
1268.956	it will help us recognize
1268.956	that simple truth
1271.742	that every life, every single life,
1275.689	matters equally and infinitely.
1278.624	Thank you very much.
1280.755	(Applause)
1282.905	Thank you. Thank you.
1287.113	(Applause)
1289.389	Thank you.
1291.571	(Applause)
