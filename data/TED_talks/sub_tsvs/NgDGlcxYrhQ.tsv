13.19	This is a map of New York State
14.875	that was made in 1937
14.875	by the General Drafting Company.
18.417	It's an extremely famous map
18.417	among cartography nerds,
21.938	because down here at the bottom
21.938	of the Catskill Mountains,
24.683	there is a little town called Roscoe --
26.586	actually, this will go easier
26.586	if I just put it up here --
29.308	There's Roscoe, and then right
29.308	above Roscoe is Rockland, New York,
32.862	and then right above that
32.862	is the tiny town of Agloe, New York.
36.699	Agloe, New York, is very famous
36.699	to cartographers,
39.782	because it's a paper town.
42.082	It's also known as a copyright trap.
44.328	Mapmakers -- because my map of New York
44.328	and your map of New York
47.706	are going to look very similar,
47.706	on account of the shape of New York --
51.396	often, mapmakers will insert
51.396	fake places onto their maps,
56.193	in order to protect their copyright.
57.979	Because then, if my fake place
57.979	shows up on your map,
60.891	I can be well and truly sure
60.891	that you have robbed me.
64.57	Agloe is a scrabblization of the initials
64.57	of the two guys who made this map,
69.235	Ernest Alpers and Otto [G.] Lindberg,
72.18	and they released this map in 1937.
75.48	Decades later, Rand McNally releases a map
78.823	with Agloe, New York, on it,
78.823	at the same exact intersection
82.871	of two dirt roads
82.871	in the middle of nowhere.
86.205	Well, you can imagine the delight
86.205	over at General Drafting.
89.49	They immediately call
89.49	Rand McNally, and they say,
92.726	"""We've caught you!"
92.726	We made Agloe, New York, up.
96.344	It is a fake place. It's a paper town.
98.422	"We're going to sue your pants off!"""
101.003	And Rand McNally says,
101.003	"""No, no, no, no, Agloe is real."""
106.616	Because people kept going
106.616	to that intersection of two dirt roads --
111.184	(Laughter)
112.232	in the middle of nowhere, expecting
112.232	there to be a place called Agloe --
116.752	someone built a place
116.752	called Agloe, New York.
120.009	(Laughter)
121.072	It had a gas station, a general store,
121.072	two houses at its peak.
124.477	(Laughter)
127.596	And this is of course a completely
127.596	irresistible metaphor to a novelist,
132.098	because we would all like to believe
132.098	that the stuff that we write down on paper
136.733	can change the actual world
136.733	in which we're actually living,
139.549	which is why my third book
139.549	"is called ""Paper Towns""."
141.962	But what interests me ultimately more
141.962	than the medium in which this happened,
146.525	is the phenomenon itself.
149.521	It's easy enough to say that the world
149.521	shapes our maps of the world, right?
153.622	Like the overall shape of the world
153.622	is obviously going to affect our maps.
158.503	But what I find a lot more
158.503	interesting is the way
161.842	that the manner in which we map
161.842	the world changes the world.
165.872	Because the world would truly be
165.872	a different place if North were down.
170.587	And the world would be
170.587	a truly different place
172.789	if Alaska and Russia weren't
172.789	on opposite sides of the map.
175.832	And the world would be a different place
177.782	if we projected Europe
177.782	to show it in its actual size.
181.93	The world is changed
181.93	by our maps of the world.
186.41	The way that we choose -- sort of,
186.41	our personal cartographic enterprise,
191.289	also shapes the map of our lives,
193.948	and that in turn shapes our lives.
196.09	I believe that what we map
196.09	changes the life we lead.
200.769	And I don't mean that in some, like,
200.769	secret-y Oprah's Angels network, like,
205.207	you-can-think-your-way-
205.207	out-of-cancer sense.
208.201	But I do believe that while maps don't
208.201	show you where you will go in your life,
214.758	they show you where you might go.
216.773	You very rarely go to a place
216.773	that isn't on your personal map.
221.853	So I was a really terrible student
221.853	when I was a kid.
224.992	My GPA was consistently in the low 2s.
228.535	And I think the reason that I was
228.535	such a terrible student
231.32	is that I felt like education
231.32	was just a series of hurdles
234.499	that had been erected before me,
236.68	and I had to jump over
236.68	in order to achieve adulthood.
240.331	And I didn't really want
240.331	to jump over these hurdles,
242.839	because they seemed completely
242.839	arbitrary, so I often wouldn't,
245.797	and then people would
245.797	threaten me, you know,
247.898	they'd threaten me with this
247.898	"""going on [my] permanent record,"""
250.851	"or ""You'll never get a good job."""
253.084	I didn't want a good job!
255.003	As far as I could tell at eleven
255.003	or twelve years old,
257.623	like, people with good jobs woke up
257.623	very early in the morning,
260.799	(Laughter)
262.828	and the men who had good jobs,
262.828	one of the first things they did
267.424	was tie a strangulation item
267.424	of clothing around their necks.
271.924	They literally put nooses on themselves,
273.996	and then they went off to their jobs,
273.996	whatever they were.
277.455	That's not a recipe for a happy life.
279.918	These people -- in my, symbol-obsessed,
279.918	twelve year-old imagination --
283.861	these people who are strangling themselves
286.444	as one of the first things
286.444	they do each morning,
288.824	they can't possibly be happy.
290.608	Why would I want to jump
290.608	over all of these hurdles
293.044	and have that be the end?
295.068	That's a terrible end!
297.454	And then, when I was in tenth grade,
297.454	I went to this school,
300.656	Indian Springs School,
300.656	a small boarding school,
303.442	outside of Birmingham, Alabama.
305.276	And all at once I became a learner.
308.815	And I became a learner,
308.815	because I found myself
311.035	in a community of learners.
313.083	I found myself surrounded by people
314.87	who celebrated intellectualism
314.87	and engagement,
318.124	and who thought that my ironic
318.124	oh-so-cool disengagement
322.321	wasn't clever, or funny,
324.199	but, like, it was a simple
324.199	and unspectacular response
327.985	to very complicated
327.985	and compelling problems.
330.692	And so I started to learn,
330.692	because learning was cool.
333.209	I learned that some infinite sets
333.209	are bigger than other infinite sets,
336.536	and I learned that iambic pentameter is
336.536	and why it sounds so good to human ears.
340.654	I learned that the Civil War
340.654	was a nationalizing conflict,
344.12	I learned some physics,
345.311	I learned that correlation shouldn't be
345.311	confused with causation --
348.491	all of these things, by the way,
350.308	enriched my life
350.308	on a literally daily basis.
354.584	And it's true that I don't use
354.584	"most of them for my ""job,"""
358.194	but that's not what it's about for me.
360.132	It's about cartography.
362.107	What is the process of cartography?
364.392	It's, you know, sailing
364.392	upon some land, and thinking,
367.577	"""I think I'll draw that bit of land,"""
369.702	"and then wondering, ""Maybe there's"
369.702	"some more land to draw."""
373.049	And that's when learning
373.049	really began for me.
375.28	It's true that I had teachers
375.28	that didn't give up on me,
377.94	and I was very fortunate
377.94	to have those teachers,
380.282	because I often gave them cause to think
380.282	there was no reason to invest in me.
384.924	But a lot of the learning
384.924	that I did in high school
388.054	wasn't about what happened
388.054	inside the classroom,
391.257	it was about what happened
391.257	outside of the classroom.
393.739	For instance, I can tell you
395.12	"that ""There's a certain Slant of light,"
395.12	Winter Afternoons --
397.977	That oppresses, like the Heft
397.977	"Of Cathedral Tunes --"""
400.454	not because I memorized
400.454	Emily Dickinson in school
403.794	when I was in high school,
405.094	but because there was a girl
405.094	when I was in high school,
407.713	and her name was Amanda,
407.713	and I had a crush on her,
410.224	and she liked Emily Dickinson poetry.
412.622	The reason I can tell you
412.622	what opportunity cost is,
415.33	is because one day when I was playing
415.33	Super Mario Kart on my couch,
419.006	my friend Emmet walked in, and he said,
420.902	"""How long have you been playing"
420.902	"Super Mario Kart?"""
423.284	"And I said, ""I don't know,"
423.284	"like, six hours?"" and he said,"
426.778	"""Do you realize that if you'd worked"
426.778	at Baskin-Robbins those six hours,
430.17	you could have made 30 dollars,
430.17	so in some ways,
432.452	you just paid thirty dollars
432.452	"to play Super Mario Kart."""
435.396	"And I was, like, ""I'll take that deal."""
437.678	(Laughter)
440.051	But I learned what opportunity cost is.
445.079	And along the way, the map
445.079	of my life got better.
448.785	It got bigger; it contained more places.
451.666	There were more things that might happen,
453.655	more futures I might have.
456.662	It wasn't a formal, organized
456.662	learning process,
459.973	and I'm happy to admit that.
461.728	It was spotty, it was inconsistent,
461.728	there was a lot I didn't know.
464.884	I might know, you know, Cantor's idea
467.202	that some infinite sets are larger
467.202	than other infinite sets,
470.059	but I didn't really understand
470.059	the calculus behind that idea.
472.98	I might know the idea of opportunity cost,
475.019	but I didn't know the law
475.019	of diminishing returns.
477.353	But the great thing about imagining
477.353	learning as cartography,
480.35	instead of imagining it
480.35	as arbitrary hurdles
482.462	that you have to jump over,
483.844	is that you see a bit of coastline,
483.844	and that makes you want to see more.
487.34	And so now I do know
487.34	at least some of the calculus
489.801	that underlies all of that stuff.
491.557	So, I had one learning community
493.351	in high school, then I went
493.351	to another for college,
495.989	and then I went to another,
497.313	when I started working
497.313	"at a magazine called ""Booklist,"""
499.933	where I was an assistant, surrounded
499.933	by astonishingly well-read people.
503.31	And then I wrote a book.
504.86	And like all authors dream of doing,
507.084	I promptly quit my job.
509.037	(Laughter)
510.65	And for the first time since high school,
512.65	I found myself without a learning
512.65	community, and it was miserable.
517.277	I hated it.
518.735	I read many, many books
518.735	during this two-year period.
522.133	I read books about Stalin,
523.92	and books about how the Uzbek people
523.92	came to identify as Muslims,
527.435	and I read books about
527.435	how to make atomic bombs,
529.809	but it just felt like I was
529.809	creating my own hurdles,
532.982	and then jumping over them myself,
532.982	instead of feeling the excitement
536.362	of being part of a community of learners,
536.362	a community of people
540.035	who are engaged together
540.035	in the cartographic enterprise
543.042	of trying to better understand
543.042	and map the world around us.
546.979	And then, in 2006, I met that guy.
550.092	His name is Ze Frank.
551.267	I didn't actually meet him,
551.267	just on the Internet.
554.455	Ze Frank was running, at the time,
554.455	"a show called ""The Show with Ze Frank,"""
559.482	and I discovered the show,
560.98	and that was my way back
560.98	into being a community learner again.
564.238	Here's Ze talking about Las Vegas:
567.823	(Video) Ze Frank: Las Vegas was built
567.823	in the middle of a huge, hot desert.
571.366	Almost everything here was brought
571.366	from somewhere else --
574.086	the sort of rocks, the trees,
574.086	the waterfalls.
576.286	These fish are almost as out of place
576.286	as my pig that flew.
579.319	Contrasted to the scorching desert
579.319	that surrounds this place,
582.209	so are these people.
583.387	Things from all over the world have been
583.387	rebuilt here, away from their histories,
587.342	and away from the people
587.342	that experience them differently.
590.114	Sometimes improvements were made --
590.114	even the Sphinx got a nose job.
593.318	Here, there's no reason to feel
593.318	like you're missing anything.
596.233	This New York means the same to me
596.233	as it does to everyone else.
599.227	Everything is out of context, and that
599.227	means context allows for everything:
602.808	Self Parking, Events Center, Shark Reef.
604.762	This fabrication of place could be one
604.762	of the world's greatest achievements,
608.384	because no one belongs here;
608.384	everyone does.
610.429	As I walked around this morning,
610.429	I noticed most of the buildings
613.477	were huge mirrors reflecting
613.477	the sun back into the desert.
616.241	But unlike most mirrors,
617.426	which present you with an outside view
617.426	of yourself embedded in a place,
620.825	these mirrors come back empty.
622.294	John Green: Makes me
622.294	nostalgic for the days
624.497	when you could see
624.497	the pixels in online video.
626.703	(Laughter)
627.734	Ze isn't just a great public intellectual,
627.734	he's also a brilliant community builder,
631.844	and the community of people
631.844	that built up around these videos
634.729	was in many ways a community of learners.
636.765	So we played Ze Frank at chess
636.765	collaboratively, and we beat him.
640.313	We organized ourselves to take a young man
640.313	on a road trip across the United States.
644.75	We turned the Earth into a sandwich,
646.725	by having one person hold a piece of bread
646.725	at one point on the Earth,
650.458	and on the exact opposite
650.458	point of the Earth,
652.611	have another person
652.611	holding a piece of bread.
655.593	I realize that these are silly ideas,
655.593	"but they are also ""learny"" ideas,"
661.625	and that was what was so exciting to me,
663.571	and if you go online, you can find
663.571	communities like this all over the place.
667.185	Follow the calculus tag on Tumblr,
669.09	and yes, you will see people
669.09	complaining about calculus,
671.765	but you'll also see people
671.765	re-blogging those complaints,
674.459	making the argument that calculus
674.459	is interesting and beautiful,
677.667	and here's a way in to thinking about
677.667	the problem that you find unsolvable.
681.644	You can go to places like Reddit,
681.644	and find sub-Reddits,
684.264	"like ""Ask a Historian"" or ""Ask Science,"""
686.906	where you can ask people
686.906	who are in these fields
690.161	a wide range of questions,
691.653	from very serious ones to very silly ones.
694.018	But to me, the most interesting
694.018	communities of learners
696.974	that are growing up on the Internet
696.974	right now are on YouTube,
699.861	and admittedly, I am biased.
701.481	But I think in a lot of ways,
701.481	the YouTube page resembles a classroom.
706.039	"Look for instance at ""Minute Physics,"""
707.887	a guy who's teaching
707.887	the world about physics:
710.704	(Video) Let's cut to the chase.
712.229	As of July 4, 2012, the Higgs boson
712.229	is the last fundamental piece
715.611	of the standard model of particle physics
715.611	to be discovered experimentally.
719.115	But, you might ask,
719.115	why was the Higgs boson
721.193	included in the standard model,
722.703	alongside well-known particles
722.703	like electrons and photons and quarks,
725.997	if it hadn't been discovered
725.997	back then in the 1970s?
728.541	Good question. There are two main reasons.
730.565	First, just like the electron
730.565	is an excitation in the electron field,
733.848	the Higgs boson is simply a particle
733.848	which is an excitation
736.666	of the everywhere-permeating Higgs field.
738.673	The Higgs field in turn
738.673	plays an integral role
740.941	in our model for the weak nuclear force.
742.894	In particular, the Higgs field
742.894	helps explain why it's so weak.
746.078	We'll talk more about this
746.078	in a later video,
748.166	but even though weak nuclear theory was
748.166	confirmed in the 1980s, in the equations,
752.024	the Higgs field is so inextricably jumbled
752.024	with the weak force, that until now
755.76	we've been unable to confirm
755.76	its actual and independent existence.
758.951	JG: Or here's a video that I made
760.75	"as part of my show ""Crash Course,"""
760.75	talking about World War I:
763.983	(Video) The immediate cause was
763.983	of course the assassination in Sarajevo
767.378	of the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand,
769.413	on June 28, 1914, by a Bosnian-Serb
769.413	nationalist named Gavrilo Princip.
773.863	Quick aside: It's worth noting
775.329	that the first big war
775.329	of the twentieth century began
777.845	with an act of terrorism.
779.09	So Franz Ferdinand
779.09	wasn't particularly well-liked
781.445	by his uncle, the emperor Franz Joseph --
781.445	now that is a mustache!
785.103	But even so, the assassination led Austria
785.103	to issue an ultimatum to Serbia,
788.902	whereupon Serbia accepted some,
788.902	but not all, of Austria's demands,
792.138	leading Austria to declare
792.138	war against Serbia.
794.722	And then Russia, due to its alliance
794.722	with the Serbs, mobilized its army.
798.127	Germany, because it had
798.127	an alliance with Austria,
800.461	told Russia to stop mobilizing,
801.982	which Russia failed to do, so then Germany
801.982	mobilized its own army,
805.265	declared war on Russia,
805.265	cemented an alliance with the Ottomans,
808.358	and then declared war on France,
808.358	because, you know, France.
811.961	(Laughter)
815.438	And it's not just physics
815.438	and world history
817.706	that people are choosing
817.706	to learn through YouTube.
820.862	Here's a video about abstract mathematics.
825.914	(Video) So you're me, and you're
825.914	in math class yet again,
828.622	because they make you go every single day.
830.648	And you're learning about, I don't know,
830.648	the sums of infinite series.
833.939	That's a high school topic, right?
835.589	Which is odd, because it's a cool topic,
835.589	but they somehow manage to ruin it anyway.
839.529	So I guess that's why they allow
839.529	infinite series in the curriculum.
842.711	So, in a quite understandable need
842.711	for distraction, you're doodling
845.887	and thinking more about what
845.887	"the plural of ""series"" should be"
848.843	"than about the topic at hand: ""serieses,"""
848.843	"""seriese,"" ""seriesen,"" and ""serii?"""
852.509	Or is it that the singular should be
852.509	"changed: one ""serie,"" or ""serum,"""
855.832	"just like the singular of ""sheep"""
855.832	"should be ""shoop."""
858.3	But the whole concept of things
859.817	like 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 and so on
859.817	approaches one, is useful if, say,
863.302	you want to draw a line of elephants,
865.089	each holding the tail of the next one:
866.929	normal elephant, young elephant,
866.929	baby elephant, dog-sized elephant,
870.121	puppy-sized elephant, all the way
870.121	down to Mr. Tusks and beyond.
873.116	Which is at least a tiny bit awesome,
874.921	because you can get an infinite number
874.921	of elephants in a line,
877.892	and still have it fit across
877.892	a single notebook page.
880.369	JG: And lastly, here's Destin,
880.369	"from ""Smarter Every Day,"""
883.015	talking about the conservation
883.015	of angular momentum,
885.448	and, since it's YouTube, cats:
886.949	(Video) Hey, it's me, Destin.
886.949	"Welcome back to ""Smarter Every Day."""
890.084	So you've probably observed that cats
890.084	almost always land on their feet.
893.45	Today's question is: why?
895.434	Like most simple questions,
895.434	there's a very complex answer.
898.214	For instance, let me reword this question:
900.248	How does a cat go from feet-up
900.248	to feet-down in a falling reference frame,
905.467	without violating the conservation
905.467	of angular momentum?
908.456	(Laughter)
909.491	JG: So, here's something all four
909.491	of these videos have in common:
913.397	They all have more than half
913.397	a million views on YouTube.
916.54	And those are people watching
916.54	not in classrooms,
919.633	but because they are part
919.633	of the communities of learning
923.298	that are being set up by these channels.
925.686	And I said earlier that YouTube
925.686	is like a classroom to me,
928.441	and in many ways it is,
928.441	because here is the instructor --
931.148	it's like the old-fashioned classroom:
931.148	here's the instructor,
934.19	and then beneath the instructor
934.19	are the students,
936.537	and they're all having a conversation.
938.632	And I know that YouTube comments
938.632	have a very bad reputation
942.685	in the world of the Internet,
944.104	but in fact, if you go on comments
944.104	for these channels,
947.199	what you'll find is people engaging
947.199	the subject matter,
950.378	asking difficult, complicated questions
950.378	that are about the subject matter,
954.649	and then other people
954.649	answering those questions.
957.411	And because the YouTube page is set up so
957.411	that the page in which I'm talking to you
962.269	is on the exact -- the place where I'm
962.269	talking to you is on the exact same page
966.136	as your comments,
967.318	you are participating in a live and real
967.318	and active way in the conversation.
972.974	And because I'm in comments usually,
972.974	I get to participate with you.
976.569	And you find this
976.569	whether it's world history,
979.047	or mathematics, or science,
979.047	or whatever it is.
982.133	You also see young people using the tools
982.133	and the sort of genres of the Internet
987.775	in order to create places
987.775	for intellectual engagement,
990.876	instead of the ironic detachment
992.5	that maybe most of us associate with memes
992.5	and other Internet conventions --
997.221	"you know, ""Got bored. Invented calculus."""
999.769	Or, here's Honey Boo Boo
999.769	criticizing industrial capitalism:
1003.244	"[""Liberal capitalism is not at all"
1003.244	the Good of humanity.
1005.934	Quite the contrary; it is the vehicle
1005.934	"of savage, destructive nihilism.""]"
1009.517	In case you can't see
1009.517	what she says ... yeah.
1012.325	I really believe that these spaces,
1016.006	these communities, have become
1016.006	for a new generation of learners,
1021.063	the kind of communities,
1021.063	the kind of cartographic communities
1025.452	that I had when I was in high school,
1025.452	and then again when I was in college.
1030.019	And as an adult, re-finding
1030.019	these communities
1033.312	has re-introduced me
1033.312	to a community of learners,
1036.646	and has encouraged me to continue
1036.646	to be a learner even in my adulthood,
1041.568	so that I no longer feel like learning
1041.568	is something reserved for the young.
1046.303	"Vi Hart and ""Minute Physics"" introduced me"
1048.55	to all kinds of things
1048.55	that I didn't know before.
1051.754	And I know that we all hearken back
1053.457	to the days of the Parisian salon
1053.457	in the Enlightenment,
1056.567	or to the Algonquin Round Table, and wish,
1058.62	"""Oh, I wish I could have been"
1058.62	a part of that,
1060.769	I wish I could have laughed
1060.769	"at Dorothy Parker's jokes."""
1063.638	But I'm here to tell you that these places
1063.638	exist, they still exist.
1068.44	They exist in corners of the Internet,
1068.44	where old men fear to tread.
1072.993	(Laughter)
1074.02	And I truly, truly believe that when
1074.02	we invented Agloe, New York, in the 1960s,
1080.869	when we made Agloe real,
1080.869	we were just getting started.
1085.246	Thank you.
1086.422	(Applause)
