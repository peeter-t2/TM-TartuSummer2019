13.185	I have a two-year-old daughter named Naya
15.686	who is under the mistaken impression
17.576	that this conference
17.576	is named in honor of her father.
21.163	(Laughter)
22.486	Who am I to contradict my baby girl?
25.495	As many of you know, there's something
25.495	about becoming a parent
29.389	that concentrates the mind
29.389	on long-term problems like climate change.
34.404	It was the birth of my daughter
34.404	that inspired me
36.893	to launch this climate organization,
39.471	in order to counteract the excessive
39.471	polarization of this issue
43.366	in the United States,
44.699	and to find a conservative
44.699	pathway forward.
49.97	Yes, folks, a Republican
49.97	climate solution is possible,
54.627	and you know what?
55.976	It may even be better.
58.332	(Laughter)
59.967	Let me try to prove that to you.
63.089	What we really need
63.089	is a killer app to climate policy.
67.687	In the technology world, a killer app
67.687	is an application so transformative
72.128	that it creates its own market,
73.631	like Uber.
75.22	In the climate world,
76.871	a killer app is a new
76.871	solution so promising
81.82	that it can break through
81.82	the seemingly insurmountable
85.391	barriers to progress.
87.276	These include the psychological barrier.
90.825	Climate advocates have long
90.825	been encouraging their fellow citizens
94.062	to make short-term sacrifices now
95.996	for benefits that accrue to other people
98.057	in other countries 30 or 40
98.057	years in the future.
101.425	It just doesn't fly because it runs
101.425	contrary to basic human nature.
106.507	Next is the geopolitical barrier.
109.844	Under the current rules of global trade,
112.136	countries have a strong incentive
112.136	to free ride off the emissions reductions
116.506	of other nations,
117.789	instead of strengthening
117.789	their own programs.
120.045	This has been the curse
121.627	of every international
121.627	climate negotiations, including Paris.
126.243	Finally, we have the partisan barrier.
129.322	Even the most committed countries --
131.417	Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada --
134.641	are nowhere near reducing emissions
134.641	at the required scale and speed.
139.386	Not even close.
140.878	And the partisan climate divide
140.878	is far more acute
145.152	here in the United States.
147.623	We are fundamentally stuck,
149.753	and that is why we need
149.753	a killer app of climate policy
153.337	to break through each of these barriers.
156.57	I'm convinced that the road
156.57	to climate progress in the United States
162.262	runs through the Republican Party
164.901	and the business community.
168.072	So in launching
168.072	the Climate Leadership Council,
170.852	I started by reaching out to a who's who
170.852	of Republican elder statesmen
174.79	and business leaders,
176.004	including James Baker and George Schultz,
179.405	the two most respected Republican
179.405	elder statesmen in America;
183.549	Martin Feldstein and Greg Mankiw,
185.442	the two most respected
185.442	conservative economists in the country;
189.108	and Henry Paulson and Rob Walton,
191.225	two of the most successful
191.225	and admired business leaders.
194.218	Together, we co-authored
196.543	"""The Conservative Case"
196.543	"For Carbon Dividends."""
199.631	This represents the first time
202.19	that Republican leaders put forth
205.805	a concrete market-based climate solution.
208.342	(Applause)
209.747	Thank you.
210.84	(Applause)
213.467	We presented our plan at the White House
215.818	two weeks after President Trump moved in.
219.465	Almost every leading
219.465	editorial board in the country
223.367	has since endorsed our plan,
225.638	and Fortune 100 companies
225.638	from a wide range of industries
230.347	are now getting behind it.
232.722	So by now you're probably wondering,
234.707	what exactly is this plan?
237.133	Well, our carbon dividends solution
237.133	is based on four pillars.
241.525	The first is a gradually
241.525	rising carbon tax.
245.459	Although capitalism is a wonderful system,
248.01	like many operating systems,
248.01	it's prone to bugs,
251.209	which, in this case, are called
251.209	"""market failures."""
254.426	By far the largest is that
254.426	market prices fail to take
257.972	social and environmental
257.972	costs into account.
261.735	That means every market transaction
261.735	is based on incorrect information.
267.099	This fundamental bug of capitalism,
267.099	more than any other single factor,
271.221	is to blame for our climate predicament.
274.58	Now in theory, this should be
274.58	an easy problem to fix.
277.915	Economists agree
279.305	that the best solution is to put a price
279.305	on the carbon content of fossil fuels,
284.117	otherwise known as a carbon tax.
286.415	This would discourage carbon emissions
290.167	in every single economic transaction,
292.511	every day of the year.
294.245	However, a carbon tax by itself
294.245	has proven to be unpopular
299.615	and a political dead end.
301.813	The answer is to return
301.813	all the money raised
305.362	directly to citizens,
307.678	in the form of equal monthly dividends.
311.499	This would transform
311.499	an unpopular carbon tax
315.055	into a popular and populist solution,
318.321	and it would also solve
320.169	the underlying psychological barrier
320.169	that we discussed,
323.506	by giving everyone a concrete benefit
323.506	in the here and now.
329.127	And these benefits would be significant.
331.44	Assuming a carbon tax rate
331.44	that starts at 40 dollars per ton,
335.206	a family of four would receive
335.206	2,000 dollars per year
338.653	from the get-go.
340.463	According to the US Treasury Department,
343.459	the bottom 70 percent of Americans
343.459	would receive more in dividends
348.513	than they would pay
348.513	in increased energy prices.
351.828	That means 223 million Americans
351.828	would win economically
358.845	from solving climate change.
361.631	And that --
362.817	(Applause)
363.896	is revolutionary,
365.47	and could fundamentally
365.47	alter climate politics.
370.598	But there's another
370.598	revolutionary element here.
373.439	The amount of the dividend would grow
376.943	as the carbon tax rate increases.
379.328	The more we protect our climate,
381.428	the more our citizens benefit.
383.307	This creates a positive feedback loop,
385.553	which is crucial,
387.107	because the only way we will reach
387.107	our long-term emission-reduction goals
391.027	is if the carbon tax rate
391.027	goes up every year.
394.799	The third pillar of our program
394.799	is eliminating regulations
398.789	that are no longer needed
400.352	once a carbon dividends plan is enacted.
403.454	This is a key selling point
403.454	to Republicans and business leaders.
410.919	So why should we trade
412.986	climate regulations for a price on carbon?
415.541	Well, let me show you.
417.996	Our plan would achieve nearly twice
417.996	the emissions reductions
422.448	of all Obama-era climate
422.448	regulations combined,
426.628	and nearly three times the new baseline
430.262	after President Trump repeals
430.262	all of those regulations.
434.443	That assumes a carbon tax
434.443	starting at 40 dollars per ton,
438.23	which translates into roughly
438.23	an extra 36 cents per gallon of gas.
443.882	Our plan by itself
446.415	would meet the high end
446.415	of America's commitment
450.012	under the Paris Climate Agreement,
452.314	and as you can see,
454.012	the emissions reductions
454.012	would continue over time.
457.521	This illustrates the power
457.521	of a conservative climate solution
463.113	based on free markets
463.113	and limited government.
466.025	We would end up with less regulation
469.228	and far less pollution at the same time,
472.344	while helping working-class
472.344	Americans get ahead.
476.352	Doesn't that sound like something
476.352	we could all support?
479.614	(Applause)
485.723	The fourth and final pillar of our program
485.723	is a new climate domino effect,
490.266	based on border carbon adjustments.
492.944	Now that may sound complicated,
495.071	but it, too, is revolutionary,
496.96	because it provides us
496.96	a whole new strategy
499.845	to reach a global price on carbon,
502.417	which is ultimately what we need.
504.308	Let me show you an example.
506.264	Suppose Country A adopts
506.264	a carbon dividends plan,
509.789	and Country B does not.
511.26	Well, to level the playing field
513.687	and protect the competitiveness
513.687	of its industries,
516.946	Country A would tax imports from Country B
520.868	based on their carbon content.
522.731	Fair enough.
524.272	But here's where it gets
524.272	really interesting,
526.44	because the money raised at the border
526.44	would increase the dividends
530.102	going to the citizens of Country A.
532.38	Well, how long do you think it would take
532.38	the public in Country B to realize
536.576	that that money should be going to them,
538.533	and to push for a carbon
538.533	dividends plan in their own land?
541.546	Add a few more countries,
543.069	and we get a new climate domino effect.
547.337	Once one major country or region
547.337	adopts carbon dividends
551.65	with border carbon adjustments,
553.299	other countries are compelled
553.299	to follow suit.
555.782	One by one the dominoes fall.
558.718	And this domino effect
558.718	could start anywhere.
561.071	My preference, strongly,
561.071	is the United States,
564.505	but it could also start
564.505	in the United Kingdom,
567.056	in Germany or another European country,
569.288	or even in China.
571.832	Let's take China as an example.
573.866	China is committed to reducing
573.866	greenhouse gas emissions,
578.434	but what its leaders care even more about
580.799	is transitioning their economy
580.799	to consumer-led economic development.
585.8	Well, nothing could do more
585.8	to hasten that transition
588.7	than giving every Chinese citizen
588.7	a monthly dividend.
592.003	In fact, this is the only policy solution
595.548	that would enable China to meet
595.548	its environmental and economic goals
599.214	at the same time.
600.596	That's why this is the killer app
600.596	of climate policy,
603.997	because it would enable us to overcome
607.36	each of the barriers we discussed earlier:
609.697	the psychological barrier,
609.697	the partisan barrier,
612.805	and, as we've just seen,
612.805	the geopolitical barrier.
616.289	All we need is a country to lead the way.
620.291	And one method of finding
620.291	what you're looking for
622.744	is to take out an ad.
624.428	So let's read this one together.
626.431	Wanted: country to pioneer
626.431	carbon dividends plan.
630.265	Cost to country: zero.
632.732	Starting date: as soon as possible.
635.035	Advantages: most effective
635.035	climate solution,
638.501	popular and populist,
640.282	pro-growth and pro-business,
642.148	shrinks government
642.148	and helps the working class.
647.101	Additional compensation: gratitude
647.101	of current and future generations,
653.458	including my daughter.
656.031	Thank you.
657.207	(Applause)
664.461	Chris Anderson: Just one
664.461	question for you, Ted.
669.221	I'm actually not sure
670.396	I've seen a conservative
670.396	get a standing O at TED before that.
673.317	That's pretty cool.
675.554	The logic seems really powerful,
677.404	but some people you talk to in politics
679.498	say it's hard to imagine this
679.498	still getting through Congress.
683.593	How are you feeling
683.593	about momentum behind this?
686.132	Ted Halstead: So I understand
686.132	that many are very pessimistic
689.781	about what's happening in
689.781	the United States with President Trump.
692.854	I'm less pessimistic; here's why.
694.457	The actions of this White House,
694.457	the early actions on climate,
697.487	are just the first move
697.487	in a complex game of climate chess.
703.09	So far it's been a repeal-only strategy;
705.725	the pressure is going to mount 
705.725	for a replacement program,
708.599	which is where we come in.
709.869	And there are three reasons why,
709.869	which I'll go through real quickly.
713.091	One, the business community
713.091	is fundamentally parting ways
716.328	with the White House on climate change.
718.788	In fact, we're finding
719.963	a number of Fortune 100 companies
719.963	supporting our program.
723.098	Within two months,
723.098	we're going to be announcing
725.321	some really surprising names
725.321	coming out in favor of this program.
728.4	Two, there is no issue
728.4	in American politics
731.557	where there's a more fundamental gap
731.557	between the Republican base
735.391	and the Republican leadership
735.391	than climate change.
738.05	And three, thinking of
738.05	this analogy of chess,
743.225	the big decision up ahead is:
743.225	Does the administration stay in Paris?
747.478	Well, let's pan it out both ways.
749.129	If it stays in Paris, as many
749.129	are pushing for in the administration,
752.946	well then that begs a question:
752.946	What's the plan?
755.565	We have the plan.
757.049	But if they don't stay in Paris,
759.144	the international pressure
759.144	will be overwhelming.
761.62	Our Secretary of State will be asking
761.62	other countries for NATO contributions,
765.271	and they'll be saying,
765.271	"""No, give us our Paris commitment."
768.197	Come through on your commitments,
768.197	"we'll come through on ours."""
771.133	So, international, business
771.133	and even the Republican base
774.451	will all be calling for
774.451	a Republican replacement plan.
778.397	And, hopefully, we've provided one.
781.351	CA: Thank you so much, Ted.
782.662	TH: Thank you, Chris.
783.837	(Applause)
