15.7	I'm Ellen and I'm totally
15.7	obsessed with food.
18.82	But I didn't start out obsessed with food.
20.844	I started out obsessed
20.844	with global security policy,
23.32	because I lived in New York during 9/11
23.32	and it was a very relevant thing.
26.8	I got from global security policy to food
28.777	because I realized when I'm hungry,
28.777	I'm really pissed off,
31.52	and I'm assuming
31.52	the rest of the world is too.
33.72	Especially if you and your kids are hungry
33.72	and your neighbor's kids are hungry
37.44	and your whole neighborhood is hungry.
39.32	And actually, it looks like
39.32	the areas of the world that are hungry
42.5	are also the areas of the world
42.5	that are pretty insecure.
45.22	So I took a job at the United Nations
45.22	World Food Programme
47.98	as a way to try to address
47.98	these security issues
50.26	through food security issues.
51.7	There, I came across what I think
51.7	is the most brilliant of their programs.
55.217	It's called School Feeding
55.217	and it's a really simple idea
57.866	to get in the middle
57.866	of the cycle of poverty and hunger
60.47	that continues for a lot of people
60.47	around the world, and stop it.
63.587	A free school meal gets kids into school,
65.58	which is education,
65.58	the first step out of poverty,
67.98	but it also gives them the micronutrients
67.98	and the macronutrients they need
71.5	to develop mentally and physically.
73.22	While I was working at the UN,
73.22	I met this girl. Her name is Lauren Bush.
76.66	And she had this really awesome idea
76.66	"to sell the bag, called the ""Feed Bag"" --"
80.351	which is really beautifully ironic
80.351	because you can strap on the Feed Bag.
83.82	But each bag we'd sell would provide
85.58	a year's worth
85.58	of school meals for one kid.
88.14	It's so simple, and we thought, OK,
90.06	it costs between 20 and 50 bucks
90.06	to provide school feeding for a year.
93.46	We could sell these bags
93.46	and raise a ton of money and awareness
96.54	for the World Food Programme.
97.98	But at the UN,
97.98	sometimes things move slowly
100.06	and they basically said no.
101.42	And we thought, this is such a good idea,
101.42	it's going to raise so much money.
105.06	So we said screw it,
105.06	we'll start our own company,
107.42	which we did, three years ago.
108.873	That was my first dream,
108.873	to start this company called FEED,
111.7	and here's a screenshot of our website.
113.62	We did a bag for Haiti
113.62	just a month after the earthquake
116.3	to provide school meals for kids in Haiti.
118.38	So FEED's doing great.
119.62	We've so far provided 55 million meals
119.62	to kids around the world
122.62	by selling now 550,000 bags,
122.62	a ton of bags, a lot of bags.
126.06	All this time you're really --
127.82	hunger is a hard thing to think about,
129.7	because what we think about is eating.
131.58	I think about eating a lot
131.58	and I really love it.
133.86	And the thing that's strange
133.86	about international hunger
136.5	and talking about international issues
138.38	is that most people want to know:
140.02	"""What are you doing for America's kids?"""
142.5	There's definitely hunger in America:
	and almost 16.7 million children.
147.1	I mean that's pretty dramatic
147.1	for our own country.
149.5	Hunger definitely means
149.5	something different in America
152.06	than it does internationally,
153.5	but it's incredibly important
153.5	to address hunger in our own country.
156.7	But the bigger problem
156.7	that we all know about is obesity,
159.42	and it's dramatic.
160.7	The other thing that's dramatic
162.22	is that both hunger and obesity
162.22	have really risen in the last 30 years.
165.7	Unfortunately, obesity's
165.7	not only an American problem.
168.3	It's actually been spreading
168.3	all around the world
170.66	and mainly through our kind
170.66	of food systems that we're exporting.
173.74	The numbers are pretty crazy.
175.18	There's a billion people
175.18	obese or overweight
177.3	and a billion people hungry.
178.7	So those seem like
178.7	two bifurcated problems,
180.98	but I kind of started
180.98	to think about, you know,
183.22	what is obesity and hunger?
184.58	What are both those things about?
186.22	Well, they're both about food.
187.7	And when you think about food,
189.7	the underpinning of food in both cases
189.7	is potentially problematic agriculture.
194.54	And agriculture is where food comes from.
197.46	Agriculture in America's very interesting.
199.5	It's very consolidated
201.26	and the foods that are produced
201.26	lead to the foods that we eat.
204.22	The foods that are produced are,
204.22	more or less, corn, soy and wheat.
207.42	And that's three-quarters
207.42	of the food that we're eating:
210.1	processed foods and fast foods.
211.66	Unfortunately, in our agricultural system,
213.7	we haven't done a good job
213.7	in the last three decades
216.18	of exporting those technologies
216.18	around the world.
218.54	So African agriculture, which is the place
218.54	of most hunger in the world,
221.9	has actually fallen precipitously
221.9	as hunger has risen.
224.62	So somehow we're not making the connect
226.74	between exporting
226.74	a good agricultural system
229.1	that will help feed people
229.1	all around the world.
231.38	Who is farming?
231.38	That's what I was wondering.
233.7	So I went and stood
233.7	on a big grain bin in the Midwest,
236.34	and that really didn't help me
236.34	understand farming,
238.74	but I think it's a really cool picture.
240.66	And the reality is
240.66	that between farmers in America --
243.62	who actually, quite frankly,
243.62	when I spend time in the Midwest,
246.58	are pretty large in general.
248.34	And their farms are also large.
250.18	But farmers in the rest of the world
250.18	are actually quite skinny,
253.18	and that's because they're starving.
254.919	Most hungry people in the world
254.919	are subsistence farmers.
257.58	And most of those people are women --
259.42	which is a totally other topic
259.42	that I won't get on right now,
262.34	but I'd love to do
262.34	the feminist thing at some point.
264.82	I think it's really interesting to look
264.82	at agriculture from these two sides.
268.42	There's this large, consolidated farming
268.42	that's led to what we eat in America,
272.14	and it's really been since around 1980,
272.14	after the oil crisis,
275.14	when, you know -- mass consolidation,
276.98	mass exodus of small farmers
276.98	in this country.
279.22	And then in the same time period,
280.86	we've kind of left Africa's farmers
280.86	to do their own thing.
283.86	Unfortunately, what is farmed
283.86	ends up as what we eat.
286.74	And in America, a lot of what we eat
286.74	has led to obesity
289.78	and has led to a real change
291.78	in sort of what our diet is,
291.78	in the last 30 years.
294.9	It's crazy.
296.14	A fifth of kids under two drinks soda.
299.02	Hello! You don't put soda in bottles.
301.02	But people do, because it's so cheap,
303.02	and so our whole food system
303.02	in the last 30 years has really shifted.
306.3	I mean, you know,
306.3	it's not just in our own country,
309.02	but really we're exporting
309.02	the system around the world,
311.98	and when you look at the data
311.98	of least developed countries --
314.9	especially in cities,
314.9	which are growing really rapidly --
318.34	people are eating
318.34	American processed foods.
320.66	And in one generation,
320.66	they're going from hunger
323.02	and all of the detrimental
323.02	health effects of hunger
326.02	to obesity and things like diabetes
326.02	and heart disease in one generation.
329.66	So the problematic food system
329.66	is affecting both hunger and obesity.
334.34	Not to beat a dead horse,
334.34	but this is a global food system
337.54	where there's a billion people hungry
337.54	and a billion people obese.
340.66	I think that's the only way to look at it.
342.74	And instead of taking these two things
344.62	as bifurcated problems
344.62	that are very separate,
346.82	it's really important
346.82	to look at them as one system.
349.74	We get a lot of our food
349.74	from all around the world
352.14	and people from all around the world
352.14	are importing our food system,
355.34	so it's incredibly relevant
355.34	to start a new way of looking at it.
358.38	I've learned --
358.38	and the technology people here,
360.66	which I'm totally not one of --
362.18	but apparently, it really takes 30 years
364.14	for a lot of technologies
364.14	to become really endemic to us,
366.98	like the mouse
366.98	and the Internet and Windows.
369.5	You know, there's 30-year cycles.
371.14	I think 2010 can be
371.14	a really interesting year
373.3	because it is the end
373.3	of the 30-year cycle,
375.34	and it's the birthday
375.34	of the global food system.
377.62	That's the first birthday
377.62	I want to talk about.
379.86	If we really think that this is something
379.86	that's happened in the last 30 years,
383.62	there's hope in that.
384.9	It's the 30th anniversary of GMO crops
386.78	and the Big Gulp, Chicken McNuggets,
386.78	high-fructose corn syrup,
389.74	the farm crisis in America
391.02	and the change in how we've addressed
391.02	agriculture internationally.
394.18	So there's a lot of reasons
394.18	to take this 30-year time period
397.06	as sort of the creation
397.06	of this new food system.
399.54	I'm not the only one who's obsessed
399.54	with this whole 30-year thing.
402.7	The icons like Michael Pollan
402.7	and Jamie Oliver in his TED Prize wish
406.42	both addressed this last
406.42	three-decade time period
409.38	as incredibly relevant
409.38	for food system change.
412.42	Well, I really care about 1980
414.02	because it's also the 30th
414.02	anniversary of me this year.
417.18	And so in my lifetime,
419.86	a lot of what's happened in the world --
421.82	and being a person obsessed with food --
423.78	a lot of this has really changed.
425.66	So my second dream is that I think
425.66	we can look to the next 30 years
429.78	as a time to change the food system again.
432.22	And we know what's happened in the past,
434.18	so if we start now
434.18	and we look at technologies
436.38	and improvements
436.38	to the food system long-term,
438.58	we might be able
438.58	to recreate the food system
440.7	so when I give my next talk
440.7	and I'm 60 years old,
443.06	I'll be able to say
443.06	that it's been a success.
445.22	So I'm announcing today
445.22	the start of a new organization,
447.9	or a new fund within the FEED Foundation,
447.9	called the 30 Project.
450.94	And the 30 Project is really focused
452.7	on these long-term ideas
452.7	for food system change.
455.54	And I think by aligning international
455.54	advocates that are addressing hunger
459.06	and domestic advocates
459.06	that are addressing obesity,
461.5	we might actually look
461.5	for long-term solutions
463.86	that will make the food system
463.86	better for everyone.
466.3	We all tend to think
466.3	that these systems are quite different
469.1	and people argue whether or not
469.1	organic can feed the world,
471.9	but if we take a 30-year view,
471.9	there's more hope in collaborative ideas.
475.34	So I'm hoping that by connecting
475.34	really disparate organizations
478.34	like the ONE campaign and Slow Food,
480.1	which don't seem right now
480.1	to have much in common,
482.5	we can talk about holistic,
482.5	long-term, systemic solutions
485.38	that will improve food for everyone.
487.34	Some ideas I've had is like,
487.34	look, the reality is --
489.793	kids in the South Bronx
489.793	need apples and carrots
492.26	and so do kids in Botswana.
493.94	And how are we going
493.94	to get those kids those nutritious foods?
496.9	Another thing that's become incredibly
496.9	global is production of meat and fish.
500.58	Understanding how to produce protein
502.34	in a way that's healthy
502.34	for the environment
504.38	and healthy for people
505.66	will be incredibly important
505.66	to address things like climate change
508.82	and how we use petrochemical fertilizers.
510.9	And, you know, these are
510.9	really relevant topics
513.22	that are long-term and important
515.06	for both people in Africa
515.06	who are small farmers
518.14	and people in America
518.14	who are farmers and eaters.
520.7	And I also think that thinking
520.7	about processed foods in a new way,
524.22	where we actually
524.22	price the negative externalities
526.9	like petrochemicals
526.9	and like fertilizer runoff
529.62	into the price of a bag of chips --
531.46	Well, if that bag of chips then becomes
531.46	inherently more expensive than an apple,
536.14	then maybe it's time for a different sense
536.14	of personal responsibility in food choice
540.34	because the choices are actually choices
542.3	instead of three-quarters of the products
542.3	being made just from corn, soy and wheat.
546.26	The 30Project.org is launched
547.7	and I've gathered a coalition
547.7	of a few organizations to start.
550.66	And it'll be growing
550.66	over the next few months.
552.86	But I really hope
552.86	that you will all think of ways
555.22	that you can look long-term
555.22	at things like the food system
557.98	and make change.
559.22	(Applause)
