13.014	You may be wondering
14.23	why a marine biologist from Oceana
16.064	would come here today to talk to you
17.904	about world hunger.
19.14	I'm here today because
21.291	saving the oceans is more than an ecological desire.
24.526	It's more than a thing we're doing
26.67	because we want to create jobs for fishermen
28.468	or preserve fishermen's jobs.
30.552	It's more than an economic pursuit.
33.9	Saving the oceans can feed the world.
36.512	Let me show you how.
38.338	As you know, there are already
40.14	more than a billion hungry people on this planet.
42.766	We're expecting that problem to get worse
45.116	as world population grows to nine billion
47.546	or 10 billion by midcentury,
49.41	and we can expect to have greater pressure
52.388	on our food resources.
54.246	And this is a big concern,
55.29	especially considering where we are now.
57.956	Now we know that our arable land per capita
60.668	is already on the decline
62.096	in both developed and developing countries.
64.805	We know that we're headed for climate change,
67.46	which is going to change rainfall patterns,
69.876	making some areas drier, as you can see in orange,
73.186	and others wetter, in blue,
75.497	causing droughts in our breadbaskets,
77.24	in places like the Midwest and Central Europe,
79.09	and floods in others.
80.372	It's going to make it harder for the land
82.134	to help us solve the hunger problem.
84.69	And that's why the oceans need
84.69	to be their most abundant,
87.154	so that the oceans can provide us
88.728	as much food as possible.
91.321	And that's something the oceans have been doing
92.968	for us for a long time.
95.61	As far back as we can go, we've seen an increase
98.29	in the amount of food we've been able to harvest
100.233	from our oceans.
101.897	It just seemed like it was continuing to increase,
104.385	until about 1980,
105.789	when we started to see a decline.
108.585	You've heard of peak oil.
110.183	Maybe this is peak fish.
112.17	I hope not. I'm going to come back to that.
113.97	But you can see about an 18-percent decline
116.473	in the amount of fish we've gotten in our world catch
119.425	since 1980.
120.78	And this is a big problem. It's continuing.
123.04	This red line is continuing to go down.
125.397	But we know how to turn it around,
127.493	and that's what I'm going to talk about today.
129.183	We know how to turn that curve back upwards.
131.583	This doesn't have to be peak fish.
134.03	If we do a few simple things in targeted places,
137.219	we can bring our fisheries back and use them
139.702	to feed people.
141.966	First we want to know where the fish are,
143.886	so let's look where the fish are.
145.457	It turns out the fish, conveniently,
147.351	are located for the most part
149.567	in our coastal areas of the countries,
151.63	in coastal zones,
152.935	and these are areas that national jurisdictions
155.339	have control over,
156.721	and they can manage their fisheries
158.545	in these coastal areas.
160.204	Coastal countries tend to have jurisdictions
162.462	that go out about 200 nautical miles,
165.07	in areas that are called exclusive economic zones,
168.441	and this is a good thing that they can control
170.434	their fisheries in these areas,
171.595	because the high seas,
173.111	which are the darker areas on this map,
175.404	the high seas, it's a lot harder to control things,
177.603	because it has to be done internationally.
179.692	You get into international agreements,
181.559	and if any of you are tracking
181.559	the climate change agreement,
183.807	you know this can be a very slow,
185.519	frustrating, tedious process.
187.501	And so controlling things nationally
189.223	is a great thing to be able to do.
191.997	How many fish are actually in these coastal areas
194.194	compared to the high seas?
195.771	Well, you can see here about
197.281	seven times as many fish in the coastal areas
200.364	than there are in the high seas,
201.951	so this is a perfect place for us to be focusing,
204.167	because we can actually get a lot done.
206.311	We can restore a lot of our fisheries
208.701	if we focus in these coastal areas.
210.895	But how many of these countries
210.895	do we have to work in?
213.919	There's something like 80 coastal countries.
215.521	Do we have to fix fisheries management
217.507	in all of those countries?
218.91	So we asked ourselves, how many countries
221.032	do we need to focus on,
222.439	keeping in mind that the European Union
224.301	conveniently manages its fisheries
225.87	through a common fisheries policy?
228.237	So if we got good fisheries management
230.529	in the European Union and,
230.529	say, nine other countries,
233.794	how much of our fisheries would we be covering?
235.883	Turns out, European Union plus nine countries
238.94	covers about two thirds of the world's fish catch.
242.054	If we took it up to 24 countries
242.054	plus the European Union,
245.333	we would up to 90 percent,
247.055	almost all of the world's fish catch.
250.265	So we think we can work in
250.265	a limited number of places
253.193	to make the fisheries come back.
254.885	But what do we have to do in these places?
257.497	Well, based on our work in the United States
259.292	and elsewhere, we know that there are
260.88	three key things we have to do
262.721	to bring fisheries back, and they are:
265.427	We need to set quotas or limits
267.373	on how much we take;
269.48	we need to reduce bycatch, which is the accidental
272.273	catching and killing of fish that we're not targeting,
274.609	and it's very wasteful;
276.459	and three, we need to protect habitats,
279.123	the nursery areas, the spawning areas
281.24	that these fish need to grow
281.24	and reproduce successfully
283.81	so that they can rebuild their populations.
285.66	If we do those three things, we 
285.66	know the fisheries will come back.
289.422	How do we know?
290.77	We know because we've seen it happening
292.785	in a lot of different places.
294.213	This is a slide that shows
295.654	the herring population in Norway
297.852	that was crashing since the 1950s.
300.175	It was coming down, and when Norway set limits,
302.326	or quotas, on its fishery, what happens?
305.244	The fishery comes back.
307.11	This is another example, also
307.11	happens to be from Norway,
310.01	of the Norwegian Arctic cod.
312.468	Same deal. The fishery is crashing.
314.524	They set limits on discards.
316.484	Discards are these fish they weren't targeting
318.598	and they get thrown overboard wastefully.
321.2	When they set the discard limit,
322.812	the fishery came back.
324.868	And it's not just in Norway.
326.135	We've seen this happening in countries
328.094	all around the world, time and time again.
331.153	When these countries step in and they
332.686	put in sustainable fisheries management policies,
335.82	the fisheries, which are always crashing, it seems,
338.636	are starting to come back.
340.574	So there's a lot of promise here.
342.432	What does this mean for the world fish catch?
344.124	This means that if we take that fishery catch
346.46	that's on the decline
347.49	and we could turn it upwards, we could increase it
349.878	up to 100 million metric tons per year.
353.416	So we didn't have peak fish yet.
355.389	We still have an opportunity
356.916	to not only bring the fish back
358.217	but to actually get more fish
359.92	that can feed more people
361.371	than we currently are now.
362.873	How many more? Right about now,
364.979	we can feed about 450 million people
367.86	a fish meal a day
368.834	based on the current world fish catch,
371.084	which, of course, you know is going down,
373.548	so that number will go down over time
375.203	if we don't fix it,
376.806	but if we put fishery management practices
379.216	like the ones I've described in place
381.78	in 10 to 25 countries,
383.885	we could bring that number up
385.364	and feed as many as 700 million people a year
388.918	a healthy fish meal.
390.466	We should obviously do this just because
392.008	it's a good thing to deal with the hunger problem,
395	but it's also cost-effective.
396.177	It turns out fish is the most cost-effective protein
400.524	on the planet.
401.9	If you look at how much fish protein you get
404.03	per dollar invested
405.03	compared to all of the other animal proteins,
407.762	obviously, fish is a good business decision.
410.692	It also doesn't need a lot of land,
412.292	something that's in short supply,
413.758	compared to other protein sources.
417.276	And it doesn't need a lot of fresh water.
419.907	It uses a lot less fresh water than,
421.979	for example, cattle,
423.02	where you have to irrigate a field
425.174	so that you can grow the food to graze the cattle.
428.317	It also has a very low carbon footprint.
430.436	It has a little bit of a carbon footprint
432.316	because we do have to get out and catch the fish.
434.315	It takes a little bit of fuel,
435.81	but as you know, agriculture
435.81	can have a carbon footprint,
438.032	and fish has a much smaller one,
439.586	so it's less polluting.
441.36	It's already a big part of our diet,
443.741	but it can be a bigger part of our diet,
445.83	which is a good thing, because we know
447.561	that it's healthy for us.
449.186	It can reduce our risks of cancer,
451.511	heart disease and obesity.
453.4	In fact, our CEO Andy Sharpless,
455.371	who is the originator of this concept, actually,
457.96	he likes to say fish is the perfect protein.
461.88	Andy also talks about the fact that
464.13	our ocean conservation movement really grew
466.636	out of the land conservation movement,
468.868	and in land conservation,
470.36	we have this problem where biodiversity
473.424	is at war with food production.
476.424	You have to cut down the biodiverse forest
479.215	if you want to get the field
481.108	to grow the corn to feed people with,
483.338	and so there's a constant push-pull there.
485.18	There's a constant tough decision
486.728	that has to be made between
488.567	two very important things:
490.588	maintaining biodiversity and feeding people.
493.681	But in the oceans, we don't have that war.
495.981	In the oceans, biodiversity is not at war
498.538	with abundance.
499.7	In fact, they're aligned.
501.805	When we do things that produce biodiversity,
504.978	we actually get more abundance,
507.03	and that's important so that we can feed people.
510.846	Now, there's a catch.
513.576	Didn't anyone get that? (Laughter)
516.121	Illegal fishing.
518.164	Illegal fishing undermines the type of
519.73	sustainable fisheries management I'm talking about.
521.98	It can be when you catch fish using gears
524.46	that have been prohibited,
525.489	when you fish in places where
525.489	you're not supposed to fish,
528.14	you catch fish that are the wrong
528.14	size or the wrong species.
531.378	Illegal fishing cheats the consumer
533.343	and it also cheats honest fishermen,
535.55	and it needs to stop.
536.71	The way illegal fish get into our 
536.71	market is through seafood fraud.
539.787	You might have heard about this.
541.236	It's when fish are labeled as something they're not.
544.42	Think about the last time you had fish.
545.955	What were you eating?
546.745	Are you sure that's what it was?
548.516	Because we tested 1,300 different fish samples
551.24	and about a third of them
552.482	were not what they were labeled to be.
554.22	Snappers, nine out of 10
554.22	snappers were not snapper.
556.96	Fifty-nine percent of the tuna we tested
559.18	was mislabeled.
561.15	And red snapper, we tested 120 samples,
563.778	and only seven of them were really red snapper,
565.694	so good luck finding a red snapper.
569.238	Seafood has a really complex supply chain,
571.466	and at every step in this supply chain,
573.762	there's an opportunity for seafood fraud,
575.952	unless we have traceability.
578.08	Traceability is a way where the seafood industry
580.799	can track the seafood from the boat to the plate
583.096	to make sure that the consumer can then find out
585.627	where their seafood came from.
587.274	This is a really important thing.
589.03	It's being done by some in
589.03	the industry, but not enough,
591.598	so we're pushing a law in Congress
592.945	called the SAFE Seafood Act,
594.351	and I'm very excited today to announce the release
596.99	of a chef's petition, where 450 chefs
599.634	have signed a petition calling on Congress
602.306	to support the SAFE Seafood Act.
604.508	It has a lot of celebrity chefs you may know --
606.336	Anthony Bourdain, Mario Batali,
609.54	Barton Seaver and others —
611.216	and they've signed it because they believe
612.97	that people have a right to know
614.298	about what they're eating.
616.673	(Applause)
622.464	Fishermen like it too, so there's a good chance
624.42	we can get the kind of support we need
626.02	to get this bill through,
626.954	and it comes at a critical time,
628.478	because this is the way we stop seafood fraud,
630.584	this is the way we curb illegal fishing,
632.65	and this is the way we make sure
634.522	that quotas, habitat protection,
636.226	and bycatch reductions can do the jobs
638.106	they can do.
639.283	We know that we can manage
639.283	our fisheries sustainably.
642.459	We know that we can produce
644.101	healthy meals for hundreds of millions of people
647.87	that don't use the land, that don't use much water,
650.115	have a low carbon footprint,
651.3	and are cost-effective.
653.102	We know that saving the oceans
655.09	can feed the world,
656.673	and we need to start now.
659.06	(Applause)
661.817	Thank you. (Applause)
