13.054	Some months back,
13.054	I was visiting this East African city,
18.558	and we were stuck in traffic.
21.571	And this vendor suddenly
21.571	approaches my window
24.637	with a half-opened alphabet sheet.
28.505	I took a quick look at the alphabet sheet,
31.348	and I thought of my daughter,
32.807	how it would be nice
32.807	to spread it on the floor
35.393	and just play all over it with her
37.257	while getting her to learn the alphabet.
39.47	So the traffic moved a bit,
39.47	and I quickly grabbed a copy,
42.789	and we moved on.
46.165	When I had time to fully open
46.165	the alphabet sheet
49.29	and take a more detailed look at it,
51.643	I knew I was not going to use that
51.643	to teach my daughter.
55.267	I regretted my purchase.
58.331	Why so?
60.338	Looking at the alphabet sheet
60.338	reminded me of the fact
63.148	that not much has changed
65.548	in the education curricula in Africa.
68.729	Some decades back, I was taught
68.729	out of a similar alphabet sheet.
73.312	And because of that,
73.312	I struggled for years.
76.464	I struggled to reconcile my reality
76.464	with the formal education I received
80.984	in school, in the schools I attended.
84.592	I had identity crises.
86.626	I looked down on my reality.
89.559	I looked at my ancestry,
89.559	I looked at my lineage with disrespect.
94.205	I had very little patience
94.205	for what my life had to offer around me.
101.045	Why?
103.496	"""A is for apple."""
106.421	"""A is for apple."""
109.528	"""A is for apple"" is for that child"
109.528	in that part of the world
114.24	where apples grow out;
116.751	who has an apple in her lunch bag;
120.235	who goes to the grocery store
120.235	with her mom and sees red,
123.661	green, yellow -- apples
123.661	of all shapes and colors and sizes.
128.049	And so, introducing
128.049	education to this child
130.962	with an alphabet sheet like this
134.09	fulfills one of the major
134.09	functions of education,
137.155	which is to introduce the learner
140.341	to an appreciation
140.341	of the learner's environment
143.738	and a curiosity to explore more
143.738	in order to add value.
149.581	In my own case,
152.014	when and where I grew up in Africa,
155.613	apple was an exotic fruit.
158.719	Two or three times a year,
160.128	I could get some yellowish apples
160.128	with brown dots, you know,
165.519	signifying thousands of miles traveled --
165.519	warehouses storing --
169.44	to get to me.
171.575	I grew up in the city
173.51	to very financially comfortable parents,
176.534	so it was my dignified reality,
178.5	exactly the same way
180.835	cassava fufu or ugali
180.835	would not regularly feature
185.021	in an American, Chinese or Indian diet,
188.851	apples didn't count as part of my reality.
192.208	So what this did to me,
195.28	introducing education to me
195.28	"with ""A is for apple,"""
198.988	made education an abstraction.
201.914	It made it something out of my reach --
204.665	a foreign concept,
206.595	a phenomenon for which I would have
206.595	to constantly and perpetually seek
210.425	the validation of those it belonged to
212.26	for me to make progress
212.26	within it and with it.
216.109	That was tough for a child;
216.109	it would be tough for anyone.
220.042	As I grew up and I advanced academically,
222.789	my reality was further separated
222.789	from my education.
228.739	In history, I was taught
230.509	that the Scottish explorer Mungo Park
230.509	discovered the Niger River.
235.631	And so it bothered me.
237.448	My great-great-grandparents grew up
239.487	quite close to the edge
239.487	of the Niger River.
241.514	(Laughter)
243.957	And it took someone to travel
243.957	thousands of miles from Europe
250.458	to discover a river
250.458	right under their nose?
252.929	(Laughter)
255.394	No!
256.575	(Applause and cheers)
262.018	What did they do with their time?
263.971	(Laughter)
265.892	Playing board games, roasting fresh yams,
268.747	fighting tribal wars?
270.557	I mean, I just knew my education
270.557	was preparing me to go somewhere else
275.441	and practice and give to another
275.441	environment that it belonged to.
279.232	It was not for my environment,
279.232	where and when I grew up.
283.029	And this continued.
284.212	This philosophy undergirded my studies
286.129	all through the time I studied in Africa.
288.618	It took a lot of experiences
288.618	and some studies
292.476	for me to begin to have
292.476	a change of mindset.
295.652	I will share a couple
295.652	of the remarkable ones with us.
299.735	I was in the United States
299.735	in Washington, DC
302.114	studying towards my doctorate,
304.18	and I got this consultancy position
304.18	with the World Bank Africa Region.
308.735	And so I remember one day,
311.515	my boss -- we were having
311.515	a conversation on some project,
316.187	and he mentioned a particular
316.187	World Bank project,
319.252	a large-scale irrigation project
319.252	that cost millions of dollars
324.248	in Niger Republic
325.603	that was faltering sustainably.
328.901	He said this project
328.901	wasn't so sustainable,
331.268	and it bothered those
331.268	that instituted the whole package.
336.035	But then he mentioned
336.035	a particular project,
339.517	a particular traditional irrigation method
339.517	that was hugely successful
344.458	in the same Niger Republic
344.458	where the World Bank project was failing.
348.93	And that got me thinking.
351.281	So I did further research,
353.984	and I found out about Tassa.
357.775	Tassa is a traditional irrigation method
361.569	where 20- to 30-centimeter-wide
361.569	and 20- to 30-centimeter-deep holes
367.786	are dug across a field to be cultivated.
371.22	Then, a small dam is constructed
371.22	around the field,
376.296	and then crops are planted
376.296	across the surface area.
379.946	What happens is that when rain falls,
383.274	the holes are able to store the water
386.282	and appropriate it to the extent
386.282	that the plant needs the water.
390.124	The plant can only assimilate
390.124	as much water as needed
393.414	until harvest time.
396.582	Niger is 75 percent scorched desert,
400.299	so this is something
400.299	that is a life-or-death situation,
403.016	and it has been used for centuries.
405.384	In an experiment that was conducted,
408.233	two similar plots of land
408.233	were used in the experiment,
413.67	and one plot of land
416.325	did not have the Tassa technique on it.
418.291	Similar plots.
419.482	The other one had Tassa technique
419.482	constructed on it.
423.332	Then similar grains of millet
423.332	also were planted on both plots.
428.045	During harvest time,
430.276	the plot of land without Tassa technique
433.452	yielded 11 kilograms
433.452	of millet per hectare.
438.737	The plot of land with Tassa technique
441.056	yielded 553 kilograms
441.056	of millet per hectare.
447.66	(Applause)
450.269	I looked at the research,
450.269	and I looked at myself.
454.206	"I said, ""I studied"
454.206	agriculture for 12 years,
457.482	from primary to Senior Six,
457.482	as we say in East Africa,
460.916	SS3 in West Africa or 12th grade.
463.286	No one ever taught me
464.967	of any form of traditional
464.967	African knowledge of cultivation --
468.797	of harvesting, of anything --
470.615	that will work in modern times
470.615	and actually succeed,
474.467	where something imported from the West
474.467	would struggle to succeed.
479.775	That was when I knew the challenge,
482.912	the challenge of Africa's curricula,
485.649	And I thus began my quest
485.649	to dedicate my life, concern my life work,
490.471	to studying, conducting research
490.471	on Africa's own knowledge system
494.787	and being able to advocate
494.787	for its mainstreaming
497.811	in education, in research, policy
500.682	across sectors and industries.
503.445	Another conversation
503.445	and experience I had at the bank
507.313	I guess made me take that final decision
507.313	of where I was going to go,
512.087	even though it wasn't the most lucrative
512.087	research to go into,
516.135	but it was just about what I believed in.
518.937	And so one day, my boss said
518.937	that he likes to go to Africa
523.587	to negotiate World Bank loans
523.587	and to work on World Bank projects.
528.614	And I was intrigued. I asked him why.
530.587	"He said, ""Oh, when I go to Africa,"
533.057	it's so easy.
535.255	I just write up my loan documents
535.255	and my project proposal in Washington, DC,
539.937	I go to Africa, and they all
539.937	just get signed.
542.914	I get the best deal, and I'm back to base.
546.326	"My bosses are happy with me."""
548.933	But then he said,
548.933	"""I hate going to Asia or ..."""
552.644	and he mentioned a particular country,
552.644	Asia and some of these countries.
556.111	"""They keep me for this, trying"
556.111	to get the best deal for their countries.
560.158	They get the best deal.
561.358	They tell me, 'Oh,
561.358	that clause will not work for us
564.29	in our environment.
565.921	It's not our reality.
565.921	It's just so Western.'
568.918	And they tell me, 'Oh,
568.918	we have enough experts
572.053	to take care of this.
573.28	You don't have enough experts.
574.925	We know our aim.'
576.102	And they just keep going
576.102	through all these things.
578.571	By the time they finish,
578.571	yes, they get the best deal,
581.115	but I'm so exhausted and I don't get
581.115	the best deal for the bank,
584.304	"and we're in business."""
585.507	"""Really?"" I thought in my head, ""OK."""
587.326	I was privileged to sit in on
587.326	a loan negotiating session
591.63	in an African country.
593.319	So I would do these consultancy
593.319	positions during summer,
596.163	you know, since I was a doctoral student.
598.871	And then I traveled with the team,
598.871	with the World Bank team,
603.227	as more like someone to help out
603.227	with organizational matters.
607.567	But I sat in during
607.567	the negotiating session.
611.73	I had mostly Euro-Americans, you know,
611.73	with me from Washington, DC.
616.686	And I looked across the table
616.686	at my African brothers and sisters.
621.993	I could see intimidation on their faces.
624.771	They didn't believe
624.771	they had anything to offer
627.058	the great-great-grandchildren
627.058	of Mungo Park --
629.37	"the owners of ""apple"" in ""A is for apple."""
632.011	They just sat and watched:
632.011	"""Oh, just give us, let us sign."
634.811	You own the knowledge. You know it all.
636.748	Just, where do we sign?
636.748	"Show us, let us sign."""
638.981	They had no voice.
638.981	They didn't believe in themselves.
646.544	Excuse me.
648.587	And so,
651.212	I have been doing this for a decade.
653.562	I have been conducting research
653.562	on Africa's knowledge system,
657.03	original, authentic,
657.03	traditional knowledge.
659.298	In the few cases where this
659.298	has been implemented in Africa,
662.519	there has been remarkable
662.519	successes recorded.
665.027	I think of Gacaca.
667.256	Gacaca is Rwanda's traditional
667.256	judicial system
672.012	that was used after the genocide.
674.13	In 1994, when the genocide ended,
678.1	Rwanda's national court system
678.1	was in shambles:
680.686	no judges, no lawyers to try
680.686	hundreds of thousands of genocide cases.
686.236	So the government of Rwanda
686.236	came up with this idea
689.768	to resuscitate a traditional
689.768	judicial system known as Gacaca.
693.625	Gacaca is a community-based
693.625	judicial system,
697.096	where community members come together
700.057	to elect men and women of proven integrity
703.83	to try cases of crimes committed
703.83	within these communities.
709.255	So by the time Gacaca concluded
709.255	its trial of genocide cases in 2012,
	had tried approximately 1.2 million cases.
723.334	That's a record.
725.169	(Applause)
730.438	Most importantly is that Gacaca emphasized
730.438	Rwanda's traditional philosophy
736.062	of reconciliation and reintegration,
739.179	as against the whole
739.179	punitive and banishment idea
743.081	that undergirds present-day Western style.
747.481	And not to compare, but just to say
747.481	that it really emphasized
751.4	Rwanda's traditional method of philosophy.
755.269	And so it was Mwalimu Julius Nyerere,
757.89	former president of Tanzania --
759.655	(Applause)
761.155	who said that you cannot develop people.
764.916	People will have to develop themselves.
768.563	I agree with Mwalimu.
770.487	I am convinced
771.899	that Africa's further transformation,
771.899	Africa's advancement,
775.546	rests simply in the acknowledgment,
775.546	validation and mainstreaming
780.349	of Africa's own traditional, authentic,
780.349	original, indigenous knowledge
785.362	in education, in research,
785.362	in policy making and across sectors.
790.816	This is not going to be easy for Africa.
793.357	It is not going to be easy for a people
793.357	used to being told how to think,
796.845	what to do, how to go about it,
799.234	a people long subjected
799.234	to the intellectual guidance
802.412	and direction of others,
804.178	be they the colonial masters,
805.869	aid industry or international news media.
808.865	But it is a task that we have to do
808.865	to make progress.
812.123	I am strengthened by the words
812.123	of Joseph Shabalala,
815.047	founder of the South African choral group
815.047	Ladysmith Black Mambazo.
818.545	He said that the task ahead of us
818.545	can never, ever be greater
824.256	than the power within us.
826.433	We can do it.
827.615	We can unlearn looking down on ourselves.
830.199	We can learn to place value
830.199	on our reality and our knowledge.
834.418	Thank you.
835.597	(Swahili) Thank you very much.
837.092	(Applause)
838.639	Thank you. Thank you.
840.865	(Applause)
