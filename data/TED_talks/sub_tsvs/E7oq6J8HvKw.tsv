13	If your life were a book
15	and you were the author,
19	how would you want your story to go?
22.573	That's the question
22.573	that changed my life forever.
27.002	Growing up in the hot Last Vegas desert,
30	all I wanted was to be free.
33	I would daydream about
33	traveling the world,
37	living in a place where it snowed,
40	and I would picture all of the stories
43	that I would go on to tell.
46	At the age of 19,
48	the day after I graduated high school,
51	I moved to a place where it snowed
54	and I became a massage therapist.
56	With this job all I needed were my hands
59	and my massage table by my side
62	and I could go anywhere.
65.245	For the first time in my life,
68	I felt free, independent
71.53	and completely in control of my life.
76.574	That is, until my life took a detour.
82.01	I went home from work early one day
84	with what I thought was the flu,
86.82	and less than 24 hours later
90	I was in the hospital
92	on life support
94	with less than a two percent chance of living.
97.01	It wasn't until days later
99.52	as I lay in a coma
102	that the doctors diagnosed me
104	with bacterial meningitis,
107	a vaccine-preventable blood infection.
111.563	Over the course of two and a half months
113.978	I lost my spleen, my kidneys,
117.67	the hearing in my left ear
120	and both of my legs below the knee.
125	When my parents
125	wheeled me out of the hospital
127.824	I felt like I had been
127.824	pieced back together
130.682	like a patchwork doll.
134.008	I thought the worst was over
136.607	until weeks later when I saw my new legs
139	for the first time.
141	The calves were bulky blocks of metal
145.792	with pipes bolted together for the ankles
149.53	and a yellow rubber foot
152.011	with a raised rubber line
152.011	from the toe to the ankle
155.971	to look like a vein.
158	I didn't know what to expect,
161	but I wasn't expecting that.
164	With my mom by my side
167	and tears streaming down our faces,
172.716	I strapped on these chunky legs
176	and I stood up.
179	They were so painful and so confining
183.28	that all I could think was,
186.01	how am I ever going to travel the world
188.71	in these things?
190	How was I ever going to live
192	the life full of adventure and stories,
194.728	as I always wanted?
197	And how was I going to snowboard again?
201.844	That day, I went home, I crawled into bed
205	and this is what my life looked like
207	for the next few months:
209.441	me passed out, escaping from reality,
213.64	with my legs resting by my side.
218.013	I was absolutely physically
218.013	and emotionally broken.
226.29	But I knew that in order to move forward,
230	I had to let go of the old Amy
235.23	and learn to embrace the new Amy.
241.02	And that is when it dawned on me
244.35	that I didn't have to be five-foot-five anymore.
248.08	I could be as tall as I wanted!
251	(Laughter) (Applause)
256.68	Or as short as I wanted,
256.68	depending on who I was dating.
260.011	(Laughter)
262	And if I snowboarded again,
264.57	my feet aren't going to get cold.
266.43	(Laughter)
268.214	And best of all, I thought,
270.45	I can make my feet the size
270.45	of all the shoes
274.176	that are on the sales rack.
274.176	(Laughter)
276.676	And I did!
278.59	So there were benefits here.
281	It was this moment that I asked myself
283.665	that life-defining question:
286.592	If my life were a book
288.932	and I were the author,
292.15	how would I want the story to go?
294.96	And I began to daydream.
297.45	I daydreamed like I did as a little girl
300.24	and I imagined myself
303	walking gracefully,
306	helping other people through my journey
308.441	and snowboarding again.
311	And I didn't just see myself
313	carving down a mountain of powder,
315	I could actually feel it.
318	I could feel the wind against my face
321	and the beat of my racing heart
324	as if it were happening
324	in that very moment.
329.01	And that is when a new chapter
329.01	in my life began.
335.4	Four months later
335.4	I was back up on a snowboard,
338.83	although things didn't go
338.83	quite as expected:
341.42	My knees and my ankles wouldn't bend
344	and at one point I traumatized
344	all the skiers on the chair lift
348.71	when I fell and my legs,
353.07	still attached to my snowboard —
355	(Laughter) —
359	went flying down the mountain,
362	and I was on top of the mountain still.
365	I was so shocked,
367	I was just as shocked as everybody else,
367	and I was so discouraged,
371.308	but I knew that if I could find the right pair of feet
375	that I would be able to do this again.
377	And this is when I learned
377	that our borders
380	and our obstacles
380	can only do two things:
384.028	one, stop us in our tracks
387	or two, force us to get creative.
391.19	I did a year of research,
391.19	still couldn't figure out
393.6	what kind of legs to use,
395	couldn't find any resources
395	that could help me.
397.287	So I decided to make a pair myself.
400.58	My leg maker and I
400.58	put random parts together
403.637	and we made a pair of feet
403.637	that I could snowboard in.
406.902	As you can see,
409	rusted bolts, rubber,
409	wood and neon pink duct tape.
416	And yes, I can change my toenail polish.
419	It was these legs
421	and the best 21st birthday gift
421	I could ever receive —
424.965	a new kidney from my dad —
427.452	that allowed me to follow my dreams again.
430	I started snowboarding,
432	then I went back to work,
432	then I went back to school.
434.916	Then in 2005 I cofounded
434.916	a nonprofit organization
438.605	for youth and young adults
438.605	with physical disabilities
440.852	so they could get involved
440.852	with action sports.
444.48	From there, I had the opportunity to go to South Africa,
448.06	where I helped to put shoes
448.06	on thousands of children's feet
451.255	so they could attend school.
453.461	And just this past February,
455.67	I won two back-to-back
455.67	World Cup gold medals —
460.36	(Applause) —
469.156	which made me
470.75	the highest ranked
470.75	adaptive female snowboarder
474.113	in the world.
475.759	Eleven years ago, when I lost my legs,
479	I had no idea what to expect.
482.449	But if you ask me today,
484	if I would ever want to
484	change my situation,
486	I would have to say no.
489	Because my legs haven't disabled me,
491	if anything they've enabled me.
493.54	They've forced me to rely on my imagination
497	and to believe in the possibilities,
500	and that's why I believe
501.78	that our imaginations can be used as tools
504	for breaking through borders,
506	because in our minds,
506	we can do anything
509	and we can be anything.
512	It's believing in those dreams
514	and facing our fears head-on
517	that allows us to live our lives
519.57	beyond our limits.
522.49	And although today is about
522.49	innovation without borders,
525.86	I have to say that in my life,
529	innovation has only been possible
531.428	because of my borders.
534.6	I've learned that borders are where the actual ends,
539.005	but also where the imagination
542	and the story begins.
544.93	So the thought that I would like 
544.93	to challenge you with today
547.916	is that maybe instead of looking at 
547.916	our challenges and our limitations
552	as something negative or bad,
555	we can begin to look at them as blessings,
558	magnificent gifts that can be used
558	to ignite our imaginations
563.525	and help us go further
563.525	than we ever knew we could go.
569.027	It's not about breaking down borders.
573	It's about pushing off of them
576.34	and seeing what amazing places
579	they might bring us.
581	Thank you.
