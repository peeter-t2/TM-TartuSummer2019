13.359	Great things happen at intersections.
16.8	In fact, I would argue
16.8	that some of the most interesting things
20.039	of the human experience
20.039	occur at the intersections,
23.84	in the liminal space,
25.52	where by liminal
25.52	I mean the space in-between.
29.6	There's freedom in that in-between,
32.32	freedom to create from the indefiniteness
32.32	of not-quite-here, not-quite-there,
38.12	a new self-definition.
41.36	Some of the great intersections
41.36	of the world come to mind,
44.4	like the Arc de Triomphe in Paris,
46.64	or Times Square in New York City,
49.12	both bustling with the excitement
49.12	of a seemingly endless stream of people.
55.08	Other intersections,
56.6	like the Edmund Pettus Bridge
56.6	in Selma, Alabama,
59.48	or Canfield Drive and Copper Creek Court
59.48	in Ferguson, Missouri, also come to mind
65.2	because of the tremendous energy
65.2	at the intersection of human beings,
70.16	ideologies and the ongoing
70.16	struggle for justice.
75.12	Beyond the physical
75.12	landscape of our planet,
77.48	some of the most famous celestial images
77.48	are of intersections.
81.52	Stars are born at the messy
81.52	intersection of gas and dust,
85.92	instigated by gravity's irrevocable pull.
89.44	Stars die by this same intersection,
89.44	this time flung outward
93.8	in a violent collision of smaller atoms,
96.2	intersecting and efficiently fusing
96.2	into altogether new and heavier things.
102.84	We can all think of intersections
102.84	that have special meaning to us.
107.76	To be intersectional, then,
109.6	is to occupy a position
109.6	at an intersection.
114.6	I've lived the entirety of my life
114.6	in the in-between,
119	in the liminal space
119	between dreams and reality,
123.28	race and gender,
125.6	poverty and plenty,
127.64	science and society.
130.72	I am both black and a woman.
133.68	Like the birth of stars in the heavenlies,
136.04	this robust combination of knowing
136.04	results in a shining example
140.56	of the explosive fusion of identities.
144.08	I am also an astrophysicist.
147.2	I study blazars, supermassive,
147.2	hyperactive black holes
152.28	that sit at the centers
152.28	of massive galaxies
154.96	and shoot out jets
154.96	nearby those black holes
157.84	at speeds approaching the speed of light
160.6	in a process we are still trying
160.6	to completely understand.
165.6	I have dreamed
165.6	of becoming an astrophysicist
168.72	since I was 12 years old.
171.2	I had no idea that at that time,
173.6	according to Dr. Jamie Alexander's archive
173.6	of African-American women in physics,
179.32	only 18 black women in the United States
179.32	had ever earned a PhD
183.68	in a physics-related discipline,
185.68	and that the first black woman to graduate
185.68	with a PhD in an astronomy-related field
190.36	did so just one year before my birth.
194.88	As I journeyed along my path,
196.72	I encountered the best and worst
196.72	of life at an intersection:
201.6	the tremendous opportunity to self-define,
204.44	the collision of expectation
204.44	and experience,
208	the exhilaration
208	of victorious breakthroughs
210.76	and, sometimes,
212.48	the explosive pain of regeneration.
216.36	I began my college experience
216.36	just after my family had fallen apart.
222.12	Our financial situation disintegrated
224.76	just after my father's
224.76	departure from our lives.
228.2	This thrust my mother, my sister and I
231.12	out of the relative comfort
231.12	of middle-class life
234.12	and into the almost constant struggle
234.12	to make ends meet.
238.52	Thus, I was one of roughly
242.36	who find finances to be a major barrier
242.36	to their educational goals.
247.24	Thankfully, Norfolk State University
247.24	provided me with full funding,
250.88	and I was able to achieve
250.88	my bachelor's in physics.
254.84	After graduation, and despite knowing
254.84	that I wanted a PhD in astrophysics,
259.88	I fell through the cracks.
262.08	It was a poster that saved my dream,
265.2	and some really incredible
265.2	people and programs.
269	The American Physical Society
269	had this beautiful poster
272.64	encouraging students of color
272.64	to become physicists.
276.36	It was striking to me
276.36	because it featured a young black girl,
279.88	probably around 12 years old,
281.68	looking studiously
281.68	at some physics equations.
286.2	I remember thinking
288.4	I was looking directly back
288.4	at the little girl
291.12	who first dared to dream this dream.
293.96	I immediately wrote to the Society
295.92	and requested my personal
295.92	copy of the poster,
299.84	which to this day
299.84	still hangs in my office.
303.24	I described to them in the email
303.24	my educational path,
306.12	and my desire to find myself again
306.12	in pursuit of the PhD.
311.04	They directed me to the Fisk-Vanderbilt
311.04	University Bridge Program,
314.8	itself an intersection
314.8	of the master's and PhD degrees
318.6	at two institutions.
321.56	After two years out of school,
321.56	they accepted me into the program,
325.08	and I found myself again
325.08	on the path to the PhD.
329.52	After receiving my master's at Fisk,
332	I went on to Yale to complete my PhD.
335.36	Once I was physically occupying
335.36	the space that would ultimately give way
339.52	to my childhood aspirations,
341.52	I anticipated a smooth glide to the PhD.
344.72	(Laughter)
346.72	It became immediately apparent
348.8	that not everyone was thrilled
348.8	to have that degree of liminality
352.84	in their space.
354.48	I was ostracized by many of my classmates,
357.56	one of whom went so far as to invite me
357.56	"to ""do what I really came here to do"""
362.92	as he pushed all the dirty dishes
362.92	from our meal in front of me to clean up.
368.56	I wish that were an isolated occurrence,
371.48	but for many women of color
373.24	in science, technology, engineering,
373.24	and mathematics, or STEM,
379.08	this is something they have long endured.
381.68	One hundred percent
381.68	of the 60 women of color
384.84	interviewed in a recent study
384.84	by Joan C. Williams at UC Hastings
389.2	reported facing racialized gender bias,
392.6	including being mistaken
392.6	for the janitorial staff.
397.28	This mistaken identity was not reported
400.2	by any of the white women
400.2	interviewed for this study,
402.76	which comprised 557 women in total.
407.56	While there is nothing inherently wrong
407.56	with a janitorial position,
411.64	and in fact my forefathers and foremothers
411.64	were able to attend college
415.08	because many of their parents
415.08	worked these jobs,
417.96	it was a clear attempt
417.96	to put me in my place.
422.84	While there was certainly
422.84	the acute pain of the encounter,
426.08	the real issue is that my appearance
428.68	can tell anyone anything about my ability.
433.24	Beyond that, though, it underscores
435.6	that the women of color in STEM
435.6	do not experience the same set of barriers
441.6	that just women
441.6	or just people of color face.
445.72	That's why today I want to highlight
445.72	women of color in STEM,
449.6	who are inexorably, unapologetically
452.52	living as the inseparable
452.52	sum of identities.
457.6	STEM itself is an intersectional term,
460.6	such that its true richness
460.6	cannot be appreciated
463.88	without considering
463.88	the liminal space between disciplines.
467.76	Science, the pursuit
467.76	of understanding the physical world
470.56	by way of chemistry, physics, biology,
473.68	cannot be accomplished
473.68	in the absence of mathematics.
477.48	Engineering requires the application
477.48	of basic science and math
481.56	to the lived experience.
483.6	Technology sits firmly
483.6	on the foundation of math,
487.32	engineering and science.
489.68	Math itself serves
489.68	the critical role of Rosetta Stone,
493.72	decoding and encoding
493.72	the physical principles of the world.
498.48	STEM is utterly incomplete
498.48	without each individual piece.
503.44	This is to say nothing
503.44	of the enrichment that is realized
506.84	when STEM is combined
506.84	with other disciplines.
510.48	The purpose for this talk is twofold:
513.08	first, to say directly to every black,
513.08	Latina, indigenous, First Nation
518.84	or any other woman or girl
520.88	who finds herself resting
520.88	at the blessed intersection
524.12	of race and gender,
526.159	that you can be anything you want to be.
530.159	My personal hope is
530.159	that you'll become an astrophysicist,
533.679	but beyond that, anything you want.
536.76	Do not think for one minute
539.84	that because you are who you are,
542.12	you cannot be
542.12	who you imagine yourself to be.
545.68	Hold fast to those dreams
548.16	and let them carry you
548.16	into a world you can't even imagine.
552.64	Secondly, among the most
552.64	pressing issues of our time,
556.4	most now find
556.4	their intersection with STEM.
560.04	We have as a global society solved
562.08	most of the single-faceted
562.08	issues of our time.
565.8	Those that remain
565.8	require a thorough investigation
569.28	of the liminal space between disciplines
572.08	to create the multifaceted
572.08	solutions of tomorrow.
576.52	Who better to solve these liminal problems
579.64	than those who have faced
579.64	their whole lives at the intersections.
584	We as thought leaders and decision makers
586.96	must push past
586.96	the first steps of diversity
590.4	and into the richer
590.4	and more robust territory
593.72	of full inclusion and equal opportunity.
597.76	One of my favorite examples
597.76	of liminal excellence
600.84	comes from the late Dr. Claudia Alexander,
603.72	a black woman plasma physicist,
605.48	who passed away this past July
605.48	after a 10-year bout with breast cancer.
610.56	She was a NASA project scientist
610.56	who spearheaded the NASA side
614.68	of the Rosetta mission,
616.16	which became famous this year
616.16	for landing a rover on a comet,
620.64	and the 1.5 billion dollar
620.64	Galileo mission to Jupiter,
625.16	two high-profile scientific victories
628.16	for NASA, the United States
628.16	and the world.
632.28	Dr. Alexander said it this way:
635	"""I'm used to walking between two cultures."
637.72	For me, it's among the purposes of my life
640.88	to take us from states of ignorance
640.88	to states of understanding
644.52	with bold exploration
644.52	"that you can't do every day."""
648.92	This shows exactly
648.92	the power of a liminal person.
652.72	She had the technical ability to spearhead
655.12	some of the most ambitious
655.12	space missions of our time,
658.24	and she perfectly understood her place
661.6	of being exactly who she was
661.6	in any place she was.
666.24	Jessica Matthews, inventor
666.24	of the SOCCKET line of sports products,
669.88	like soccer balls, that generate
669.88	renewable energy as you play with them,
673.88	said it this way:
675.76	"""A major part of invention"
675.76	isn't just creating things,
679.24	it's understanding people
681.08	and understanding the systems
681.08	"that make this world."""
685.32	The reason I tell my story
687.16	and the story of Dr. Alexander
687.16	and Jessica Matthews
690.24	is because they are fundamentally
690.24	intersectional stories,
694.12	the stories of lives lived at the nexus
694.12	of race, gender and innovation.
700.76	Despite implicit and explicit questions
700.76	of my right to be in an elite space,
706.4	I'm proud to report that when I graduated,
709	I was the first black woman
709	to earn a PhD in astrophysics
712.48	in Yale's then 312-year history.
715.6	(Applause)
721.52	I am now part of a small but growing cadre
721.52	of women of color in STEM
726.96	who are poised to bring new perspectives
726.96	and new ideas to life
731	on the most pressing issues of our time:
733.8	things like educational inequities,
736	police brutality, HIV/AIDS,
736	climate change, genetic editing,
742	artificial intelligence
742	and Mars exploration.
745.4	This is to say nothing of the things
745.4	we haven't even thought of yet.
749.72	Women of color in STEM
749.72	occupy some of the toughest
753.24	and most exciting sociotechnological
753.24	issues of our time.
758.04	Thus, we are uniquely positioned
760.4	to contribute to
760.4	and drive these conversations
763.84	in ways that are more inclusive
763.84	of a wider variety of lived experience.
769	This outlook can be expanded
769	to the many intersectional people
772.6	whose experiences, positive and negative,
775.68	enrich the conversations
775.68	in ways that outmatch
778.76	even the best-resourced homogenous groups.
782.88	This is not a request
782.88	born out of a desire to fit in.
786.8	It's a reminder that we cannot get
786.8	to the best possible outcomes
791.32	for the totality of humanity
793.52	without precisely this collaboration,
796	this bringing together of the liminal,
798.56	the differently lived,
798.56	distinctly experienced
802.08	and disparately impacted.
804.64	Simply put, we cannot be
804.64	the most excellent expression
808.68	of our collective genius
810.48	without the full measure
810.48	of humanity brought to bear.
814	Thank you.
815.24	(Applause)
