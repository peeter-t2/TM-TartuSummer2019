15.871	So, last month, the Encyclopaedia Britannica announced
19.257	that it is going out of print
21.006	after 244 years, which made me nostalgic,
24.831	because I remember playing a game with the colossal encyclopedia set in my hometown library
30.478	back when I was a kid,
31.727	maybe 12 years old.
33.07	And I wondered if I could update that game,
35.71	not just for modern methods,
37.726	but for the modern me.
39.43	So I tried.
40.566	I went to an online encyclopedia,
41.873	"Wikipedia, and I entered the term ""Earth."""
44.631	You can start anywhere, this time I chose Earth.
47.297	And the first rule of the game is pretty simple.
49.775	You just have to read the article
51.266	until you find something you don't know,
53.854	and preferably something your dad doesn't even know.
56.959	And in this case, I quickly found this:
59.838	The furthest point from the center of the Earth
62.134	is not the tip of Mount Everest, like I might have thought,
64.607	it's the tip of this mountain: Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador.
67.903	The Earth spins, of course, as it travels around the sun,
71.423	so the Earth bulges a little bit around the middle,
73.407	like some Earthlings.
74.534	And even though Mount Chimborazo isn't the tallest mountain in the Andes,
79.424	it's one degree away from the equator,
81.095	it's riding that bulge, and so the summit of Chimborazo
84.095	is the farthest point on Earth from the center of the Earth.
87.495	And it is really fun to say.
90.447	So I immediately decided,
91.39	this is going to be the name of the game,
93.287	or my new exclamation.
94.774	You can use it at TED.
95.744	Chimborazo, right?
97.073	"It's like ""eureka"" and ""bingo"" had a baby."
98.775	I didn't know that;
100.504	that's pretty cool.
102.134	Chimborazo!
103.799	So the next rule of the game is also pretty simple.
107.424	You just have to find another term and look that up.
110.311	Now in the old days, that meant getting out a volume
112.476	and browsing through it alphabetically,
114.111	maybe getting sidetracked,
115.15	that was fun.
115.855	Nowadays there are hundreds of links to choose from.
118.486	I can go literally anywhere in the world,
120.438	I think since I was already in Ecuador,
122.167	"I just decided to click on the word ""tropical."""
124.878	That took me to this wet and warm band of the tropics
130.119	that encircles the Earth.
131.304	Now that's the Tropic of Cancer in the north
133.765	and the Tropic of Capricorn in the south,
135.278	that much I knew,
136.086	but I was surprised to learn this little fact:
138.287	Those are not cartographers' lines,
140.553	like latitude or the borders between nations,
144.158	they are astronomical phenomena caused by the Earth's tilt,
146.889	and they change.
148.494	They move; they go up, they go down.
151.144	In fact, for years, the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn
154.343	have been steadily drifting towards the equator
156.983	at the rate of about 15 meters per year,
159.48	and nobody told me that.
160.646	I didn't know it.
161.47	Chimborazo!
162.888	So to keep the game going, I just have to find another term and look that one up.
168.664	"Since I'm already in the tropics, I chose ""Tropical rainforest."""
172.463	Famous for its diversity, human diversity.
174.746	There are still dozens and dozens of uncontacted tribes living on this planet.
180.272	They're all over the globe, but virtually all of them live in tropical rainforests.
184.75	"This is the only place you can go nowadays and not get ""friended."""
189.727	The link that I clicked on here was exotic in the beginning and then absolutely mysterious at the very end.
198.592	It mentioned leopards and ring-tailed coatis and poison dart frogs and boa constrictors and then
205.352	coleoptera,
207.287	which turn out to be beetles.
210.526	Now I clicked on this on purpose,
212.75	but if I'd somehow gotten here by mistake,
214.304	"it does remind me, for the band, see ""The Beatles,"""
216.401	"for the car see ""Volkswagon Beetle,"""
218.007	but I am here for beetle beetles.
220.744	This is the most successful order on the planet by far.
224.614	Something between 20 and 25 percent of all life forms on the planet,
228.864	including plants, are beetles.
230.67	That means the next time you are in the grocery store,
232.853	take a look at the four people ahead of you in line.
235.055	Statistically, one of you is a beetle.
238.072	And if it is you, you are astonishingly well adapted.
243.67	There are scavenger beetles that pick the skin and flesh off of bones in museums.
248.703	There are predator beetles, that attack other insects
251.784	and still look pretty cute to us.
253.567	There are beetles that roll little balls of dung
257.071	great distances across the desert floor to feed to their hatchlings.
260.366	This reminded the ancient Egyptians of their god Khepri,
264.15	who renews the ball of the sun every morning,
267.464	which is how that dung-rolling scarab
269.487	became that sacred scarab on the breastplate of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun.
274.855	Beetles, I was reminded, have the most romantic flirtation in the animal kingdom.
280.783	Fireflies are not flies, fireflies are beetles.
283.366	Fireflies are coleoptera, and coleoptera communicate in other ways as well.
288.678	Like my next link:
290.054	The chemical language of pheromones.
292.993	Now the pheromone page took me to a video of a sea urchin having sex.
299.046	Yeah.
302.726	(Laughter)
305.814	And the link to aphrodisiac.
307.886	Now that's something that increases sexual desire,
309.55	possibly chocolate.
311.751	There is a compound in chocolate called phenethylamine
315.254	that might be an aphrodisiac.
316.624	But as the article mentions,
318.879	because of enzyme breakdown,
320.094	it's unlikely that phenethylamine will reach your brain if taken orally.
324.264	So those of you who only eat your chocolate, you might have to experiment.
327.374	The link I clicked on here,
331.184	"""sympathetic magic,"" mostly because I understand what both of those words mean."
336.383	But not when they're together like that.
338.535	I do like sympathy. I do like magic.
341.526	"So when I click on ""sympathetic magic,"""
342.871	I get sympathetic magic and voodoo dolls.
347.676	This is the boy in me getting lucky again.
349.824	Sympathetic magic is imitation.
352.343	If you imitate something, maybe you can have an effect on it.
354.75	That's the idea behind voodoo dolls, and possibly also cave paintings.
359.184	The link to cave paintings takes me to some of the oldest art known to humankind.
364.264	I would love to see Google maps inside some of these caves.
366.271	We've got tens-of-thousands-years-old artwork.
369.767	Common themes around the globe include large wild animals and tracings of human hands,
374.766	usually the left hand.
377.087	We have been a dominantly right-handed tribe for millenia,
381.55	so even though I don't know why a paleolithic person would trace his hand
386.886	or blow pigment on it from a tube,
388.872	I can easily picture how he did it.
391.464	And I really don't think it's that different form our own little dominant hand avatar
395.966	"right there that I'm going to use now to click on the term for ""hand,"""
399.298	"go to the page for ""hand,"" where I found the most fun and possibly embarrassing bit of trivia"
405.59	I've found in a long time. It's simply this:
407.624	The back of the hand is formally called the opisthenar.
411.806	Now that's embarrassing, because up until now,
415.479	"every time I've said, ""I know it like the back of my hand,"""
418.679	"I've really been saying, ""I'm totally familiar with that,"
421.038	"I just don't know it's freaking name, right?"""
423.624	And the link I clicked on here,
427.278	well, lemurs, monkeys and chimpanzees have the little opisthenar.
431.43	I click on chimpanzee, and I get our closest genetic relative.
435.68	"Pan troglodytes, the name we give him, means ""cave dweller."""
439.671	He doesn't.
441.175	He lives in rainforests and savannas.
442.999	It's just that we're always thinking of this guy as lagging behind us,
446.206	evolutionarily or somehow uncannily creeping up on us,
449.27	and in some cases, he gets places before us.
452.944	Like my next link, the almost irresistible link, Ham the Astrochimp.
458.166	I click on him, and I really thought he was going to bring me full circle twice, in fact.
462.344	He's born in Cameroon,
463.544	which is smack in the middle of my tropics map,
467.304	and more specifically his skeleton wound up in the Smithsonian museum getting picked clean by beetles.
473.526	In between those two landmarks in Ham's life,
476.479	he flew into space.
479.015	He experienced weightlessness and re-entry
482.252	months before the first human being to do it,
484.823	Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.
487.687	When I click on Yuri Gagarin's page,
489.839	I get this guy who was surprisingly short in stature,
492.758	huge in heroism.
494.295	Top estimates, Soviet estimates, put this guy at 1.65 meters,
498.638	that is less than five and a half feet tall max,
501.639	possibly because he was malnourished as a child.
504.445	Germans occupied Russia.
506.99	A Nazi officer took over the Gagarin household,
510.087	and he and his family built and lived in a mud hut.
512.891	Years later, the boy from that cramped mud hut
516.438	would grow up to be the man in that cramped capsule
519.944	on the tip of a rocket
521.558	who volunteered to be launched into outer space,
525.046	the first one of any of us to really physically leave this planet.
529.398	And he didn't just leave it,
530.746	he circled it once.
533.271	Fifty years later, as a tribute,
535.497	the International Space Station, which is still up there tonight,
539.424	synced its orbit with Gagarin's orbit,
543.504	at the exact same time of day,
544.67	and filmed it,
546.23	so you can go online and you can watch over 100 minutes
549.814	of what must have been an absolutely mesmerizing ride,
553.323	possibly a lonely one,
554.464	the first person to ever see such a thing.
556.744	And then when you've had your fill of that,
558.167	you can click on one more link.
560.784	You can come back to Earth.
562.126	You return to where you started.
564.287	You can finish your game.
566.504	You just need to find one more fact that you didn't know.
570.094	And for me, I quickly landed on this one:
572.574	The Earth has a tolerance of about .17 percent from the reference spheroid,
577.59	which is less than the .22 percent allowed in billiard balls.
581.559	This is the kind of fact I would have loved as a boy.
583.991	I found it myself.
585.238	It's got some math that I can do.
587.513	I'm pretty sure my dad doesn't know it.
589.638	What this means is that if you could shrink the Earth to the size of a billiard ball,
595.127	if you could take planet Earth, with all its mountain tops and caves
601.144	and rainforests, astronauts and uncontacted tribes and chimpanzees, voodoo dolls,
605.82	fireflies, chocolate, sea creatures making love in the deep blue sea,
611.344	you just shrink that to the size of a billiard ball,
614.545	it would be as smooth as a billiard ball,
618.438	presumably a billiard ball with a slight bulge around the middle.
623.055	That's pretty cool.
625.846	I didn't know that.
627.79	Chimborazo!
630.015	Thank you.
630.904	(Applause)
