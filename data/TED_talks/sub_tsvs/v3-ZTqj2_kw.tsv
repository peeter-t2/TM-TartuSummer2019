15.26	Gabriel García Márquez is one of my favorite writers,
17.26	for his storytelling,
19.26	but even more, I think,
21.26	for the beauty and precision of his prose.
23.26	"And whether it's the opening line from ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"""
27.26	or the fantastical stream of consciousness
29.26	"in ""Autumn of the Patriarch,"""
31.26	where the words rush by,
33.26	page after page of unpunctuated imagery
35.26	sweeping the reader along
37.26	like some wild river
39.26	twisting through a primal South American jungle,
41.26	reading Márquez is a visceral experience.
44.26	Which struck me as particularly remarkable
46.26	during one session with the novel
48.26	when I realized that I was being swept along
50.26	on this remarkable, vivid journey
53.26	in translation.
55.26	Now I was a comparative literature major in college,
57.26	which is like an English major,
59.26	only instead of being stuck studying Chaucer for three months,
61.26	we got to read great literature in translation
63.26	from around the world.
65.26	And as great as these books were,
67.26	you could always tell
69.26	that you were getting close to the full effect.
71.26	But not so with Márquez
73.26	who once praised his translator's versions
75.26	as being better than his own,
78.26	which is an astonishing compliment.
81.26	So when I heard that the translator, Gregory Rabassa,
83.26	had written his own book on the subject,
85.26	I couldn't wait to read it.
87.26	It's called apropos of the Italian adage
89.26	that I lifted from his forward,
91.26	"""If This Be Treason."""
93.26	And it's a charming read.
95.26	It's highly recommended for anyone who's interested
97.26	in the translator's art.
99.26	But the reason that I mention it
101.26	is that early on, Rabassa offers
103.26	this elegantly simple insight:
107.26	"""Every act of communication"
109.26	"is an act of translation."""
112.26	Now maybe that's been obvious to all of you for a long time,
115.26	but for me,
117.26	as often as I'd encountered
119.26	that exact difficulty on a daily basis,
121.26	I had never seen the inherent challenge of communication
124.26	in so crystalline a light.
126.26	Ever since I can remember
128.26	thinking consciously about such things,
130.26	communication has been my central passion.
132.26	Even as a child,
134.26	I remember thinking that what I really wanted most in life
137.26	was to be able to understand everything
140.26	and then to communicate it to everyone else.
143.26	So no ego problems.
146.26	It's funny, my wife, Daisy,
148.26	whose family is littered with schizophrenics --
150.26	and I mean littered with them --
153.26	"once said to me, ""Chris, I already have a brother who thinks he's God."
157.26	"I don't need a husband who wants to be."""
159.26	(Laughter)
161.26	Anyway, as I plunged through my 20s
163.26	ever more aware of how unobtainable
165.26	the first part of my childhood ambition was,
168.26	it was that second part,
170.26	being able to successfully communicate to others
172.26	whatever knowledge I was gaining,
174.26	where the futility of my quest really set in.
177.26	Time after time,
179.26	whenever I set out to share some great truth
181.26	with a soon-to-be grateful recipient,
183.26	it had the opposite effect.
186.26	Interestingly, when your opening line of communication is,
188.26	"""Hey, listen up,"
190.26	"because I'm about to drop some serious knowledge on you,"""
194.26	it's amazing how quickly you'll discover
196.26	both ice and the firing squad.
200.26	Finally, after about 10 years
202.26	of alienating friends and strangers alike,
205.26	I finally got it,
207.26	a new personal truth all my own,
210.26	that if I was going to ever communicate well with other people
214.26	the ideas that I was gaining,
216.26	I'd better find a different way of going about it.
218.26	And that's when I discovered comedy.
221.26	Now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength
224.26	from other forms of language.
226.26	If I had to place it on an arbitrary spectrum,
228.26	I'd say it falls somewhere
230.26	between poetry and lies.
234.26	And I'm not talking about all comedy here,
236.26	because, clearly, there's plenty of humor
238.26	that colors safely within the lines of what we already think and feel.
241.26	What I want to talk about
243.26	is the unique ability that the best comedy and satire has
246.26	at circumventing our ingrained perspectives --
249.26	comedy as the philosopher's stone.
252.26	It takes the base metal of our conventional wisdom
255.26	and transforms it through ridicule
257.26	into a different way of seeing
259.26	and ultimately being in the world.
261.26	Because that's what I take
263.26	from the theme of this conference: Gained in Translation.
266.26	That it's about communication
268.26	that doesn't just produce greater understanding
270.26	within the individual,
272.26	but leads to real change.
274.26	Which in my experience means communication
276.26	that manages to speak to and expand
279.26	our concept of self-interest.
282.26	Now I'm big on speaking to people's self-interest
284.26	because we're all wired for that.
286.26	It's part of our survival package,
288.26	and that's why it's become so important for us,
291.26	and that's why we're always listening at that level.
294.26	And also because that's where,
297.26	in terms of our own self-interest,
299.26	we finally begin to grasp
301.26	our ability to respond, our responsibility
304.26	to the rest of the world.
306.26	Now as to what I mean by the best comedy and satire,
309.26	I mean work that comes first and foremost
311.26	from a place of honesty and integrity.
314.26	Now if you think back
316.26	on Tina Fey's impersonations on Saturday Night Live
319.26	of the newly nominated vice presidential candidate
321.26	Sarah Palin,
323.26	they were devastating.
325.26	Fey demonstrated far more effectively than any political pundit
328.26	the candidate's fundamental lack of seriousness,
331.26	cementing an impression
333.26	that the majority of the American public still holds today.
336.26	And the key detail of this
338.26	is that Fey's scripts weren't written by her
340.26	and they weren't written by the SNL writers.
342.26	They were lifted verbatim
344.26	from Palin's own remarks.
346.26	(Laughter)
350.26	Here was a Palin impersonator
352.26	quoting Palin word for word.
354.26	Now that's honesty and integrity,
356.26	and it's also why Fey's performances
358.26	left such a lasting impression.
360.26	On the other side of the political spectrum,
363.26	the first time that I heard Rush Limbaugh
365.26	refer to presidential hopeful John Edwards as the Breck girl
369.26	I knew that he'd made a direct hit.
372.26	Now it's not often that I'm going to associate
374.26	the words honesty and integrity with Limbaugh,
377.26	but it's really hard to argue with that punchline.
380.26	The description perfectly captured
382.26	Edwards' personal vanity.
384.26	And guess what?
386.26	That ended up being the exact personality trait
388.26	that was at the core of the scandal that ended his political career.
393.26	Now The Daily Show with John Stewart
395.26	is by far the most --
397.26	(Applause)
404.26	(Laughter)
406.26	it's by far the most well-documented example
409.26	of the effectiveness of this kind of comedy.
412.26	Survey after survey,
414.26	from Pew Research to the Annenberg Center for Public Policy,
417.26	has found that Daily Show viewers are better informed about current events
420.26	than the viewers of all major network and cable news shows.
424.26	(Applause)
427.26	Now whether this says more
429.26	about the conflict between integrity and profitability
432.26	of corporate journalism
434.26	than it does about the attentiveness of Stewart's viewers,
436.26	the larger point remains
438.26	that Stewart's material
440.26	is always grounded in a commitment to the facts --
443.26	not because his intent is to inform. It's not.
445.26	His intent is to be funny.
447.26	It just so happens that Stewart's brand of funny
450.26	doesn't work unless the facts are true.
453.26	And the result is great comedy
455.26	that's also an information delivery system
458.26	that scores markedly higher in both credibility and retention
461.26	than the professional news media.
464.26	Now this is doubly ironic
466.26	when you consider that what gives comedy its edge
469.26	at reaching around people's walls
471.26	is the way that it uses deliberate misdirection.
474.26	A great piece of comedy is a verbal magic trick,
477.26	where you think it's going over here
479.26	and then all of a sudden you're transported over here.
482.26	And there's this mental delight
484.26	that's followed by the physical response of laughter,
486.26	which, not coincidentally,
488.26	releases endorphins in the brain.
490.26	And just like that, you've been seduced
492.26	into a different way of looking at something
494.26	because the endorphins have brought down your defenses.
497.26	This is the exact opposite
499.26	of the way that anger and fear and panic,
501.26	all of the flight-or-fight responses, operate.
504.26	Flight-or-fight releases adrenalin,
507.26	which throws our walls up sky-high.
509.26	And the comedy comes along,
511.26	dealing with a lot of the same areas
513.26	where our defenses are the strongest --
515.26	race, religion, politics, sexuality --
518.26	only by approaching them through humor instead of adrenalin,
521.26	we get endorphins
523.26	and the alchemy of laughter turns our walls into windows,
526.26	revealing a fresh and unexpected point of view.
529.26	Now let me give you an example from my act.
532.26	I have some material
534.26	about the so-called radical gay agenda,
536.26	which starts off by asking,
538.26	how radical is the gay agenda?
540.26	Because from what I can tell, the three things gay Americans seem to want most
543.26	are to join the military, get married and start a family.
546.26	(Laughter)
550.26	Three things I've tried to avoid my entire life.
554.26	(Laughter)
556.26	Have at it you radical bastards. The field is yours.
559.26	(Laughter)
562.26	And that's followed by these lines
564.26	about gay adoption:
566.26	What is the problem with gay adoption?
568.26	Why is this remotely controversial?
570.26	If you have a baby and you think that baby's gay,
573.26	you should be allowed to put it up for adoption.
575.26	(Laughter)
577.26	You have given birth to an abomination.
579.26	Remove it from your household.
583.26	"Now by taking the biblical epithet ""abomination"""
586.26	and attaching it to the ultimate image of innocence, a baby,
590.26	this joke short circuits the emotional wiring
592.26	behind the debate
594.26	and it leaves the audience with the opportunity, through their laughter,
597.26	to question its validity.
599.26	Misdirection isn't the only trick
601.26	that comedy has up its sleeve.
603.26	Economy of language
605.26	is another real strong suit of great comedy.
607.26	There are few phrases
609.26	that pack a more concentrated dose of subject and symbol
612.26	than the perfect punchline.
614.26	Bill Hicks -- and if you don't know his work,
616.26	you should really Google him --
618.26	Hicks had a routine
620.26	about getting into one of those childhood bragging contests on the playground,
623.26	where finally the other kid says to him,
625.26	"""Huh? Well my dad can beat up your dad,"""
628.26	to which Hicks replies,
630.26	"""Really? How soon?"""
632.26	(Laughter)
637.26	That's an entire childhood
639.26	in three words.
641.26	(Laughter)
644.26	Not to mention what it reveals
646.26	about the adult who's speaking them.
648.26	And one last powerful attribute
650.26	that comedy has as communication
652.26	is that it's inherently viral.
654.26	People can't wait
656.26	to pass along that new great joke.
658.26	And this isn't some new phenomenon of our wired world.
661.26	Comedy has been crossing country
663.26	with remarkable speed
665.26	way before the Internet, social media,
667.26	even cable TV.
669.26	Back in 1980
671.26	when comedian Richard Pryor accidentally set himself on fire
674.26	during a freebasing accident,
676.26	I was in Los Angeles the day after it happened
678.26	and then I was in Washington D.C. two days after that.
682.26	And I heard the exact same punchline on both coasts --
685.26	something about the Ignited Negro College Fund.
689.26	Clearly, it didn't come out of a Tonight Show monologue.
693.26	And my guess here -- and I have no research on this --
695.26	is that if you really were to look back at it and if you could research it,
698.26	you'd find out that comedy
700.26	is the second oldest viral profession.
702.26	First there were drums
704.26	and then knock-knock jokes.
706.26	(Laughter)
708.26	But it's when you put all of these elements together --
711.26	when you get the viral appeal of a great joke
714.26	with a powerful punchline
716.26	that's crafted from honesty and integrity,
718.26	it can have a real world impact
721.26	at changing a conversation.
723.26	Now I have a close friend, Joel Pett,
725.26	who's the editorial cartoonist
727.26	for the Lexington Herald-Leader.
729.26	And he used to be the USA Today Monday morning guy.
732.26	I was visiting with Joel
734.26	the weekend before the Copenhagen conference on climate change opened
737.26	in December of 2009.
739.26	And Joel was explaining to me
741.26	that, because USA Today
743.26	was one of America's four papers of record,
745.26	it would be scanned by virtually everyone in attendance at the conference,
749.26	which meant that, if he hit it out of the park with his cartoon
752.26	on Monday, the opening day of the conference,
754.26	it could get passed around
756.26	at the highest level among actual decision-makers.
759.26	So we started talking about climate change.
762.26	And it turned out that Joel and I
764.26	were both bothered by the same thing,
766.26	which was how so much of the debate
768.26	was still focused on the science
770.26	and how complete it was or wasn't,
772.26	which, to both of us,
774.26	seems somewhat intentionally off point.
777.26	Because first of all, there's this false premise
780.26	that such a thing as complete science exists.
784.26	Now Governor Perry of my newly-adopted state of Texas
787.26	was pushing this same line this past summer
790.26	at the beginning of his oops-fated campaign
794.26	for the Republican presidential nomination,
797.26	proclaiming over and over that the science wasn't complete
800.26	at the same time that 250
803.26	out of 254 counties in the state of Texas
806.26	were on fire.
809.26	And Perry's policy solution
811.26	was to ask the people of Texas
813.26	to pray for rain.
816.26	Personally, I was praying for four more fires
818.26	so we could finally complete the damn science.
821.26	(Laughter)
826.26	But back in 2009,
828.26	the question Joel and I kept turning over and over
831.26	was why this late in the game
833.26	so much energy was being spent talking about the science
836.26	when the policies necessary to address climate change
839.26	were unequivocally beneficial for humanity in the long run
843.26	regardless of the science.
845.26	So we tossed it back and forth until Joel came up with this.
848.26	"Cartoon: ""What if it's a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing?"""
856.26	(Laughter)
859.26	You've got to love that idea.
861.26	(Applause)
868.26	How about that? How about we create a better world for nothing?
872.26	Not for God, not for country, not for profit --
875.26	just as a basic metric for global decision-making.
879.26	And this cartoon hit the bull's eye.
882.26	Shortly after the conference was over,
884.26	Joel got a request for a signed copy
886.26	from the head of the EPA in Washington
888.26	whose wall it now hangs on.
890.26	And not long after that, he got another request for a copy
893.26	from the head of the EPA in California
895.26	who used it as part of her presentation
898.26	at an international conference on climate change
901.26	in Sacramento last year.
903.26	And it didn't stop there.
905.26	To date, Joel's gotten requests from over 40 environmental groups,
908.26	in the United States, Canada and Europe.
911.26	And earlier this year,
913.26	he got a request from the Green Party in Australia
915.26	who used it in their campaign
917.26	where it became part of the debate
919.26	that resulted in the Australian parliament
922.26	adopting the most rigorous carbon tax regime
924.26	of any country in the world.
927.26	(Applause)
932.26	That is a lot of punch
934.26	for 14 words.
937.26	So my suggestion to those of you out here
939.26	who are seriously focused on creating a better world
942.26	is to take a little bit of time each day
944.26	and practice thinking funny,
947.26	because you might just find the question that you've been looking for.
950.26	Thank you.
952.26	(Applause)
