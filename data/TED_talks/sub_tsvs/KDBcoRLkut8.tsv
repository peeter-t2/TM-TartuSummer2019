12.844	When we think about prejudice and bias,
15.222	we tend to think about stupid and evil people
17.366	doing stupid and evil things.
19.82	And this idea is nicely summarized
21.89	by the British critic William Hazlitt,
24.358	"who wrote, ""Prejudice is the child of ignorance."""
27.293	I want to try to convince you here
29.405	that this is mistaken.
31.04	I want to try to convince you
32.772	that prejudice and bias
34.495	are natural, they're often rational,
37.783	and they're often even moral,
39.614	and I think that once we understand this,
41.866	we're in a better position to make sense of them
44.375	when they go wrong,
45.432	when they have horrible consequences,
47.2	and we're in a better position to know what to do
49.525	when this happens.
51.207	So, start with stereotypes. You look at me,
54.234	you know my name, you
54.234	know certain facts about me,
56.48	and you could make certain judgments.
58.309	You could make guesses about my ethnicity,
61.162	my political affiliation, my religious beliefs.
64.443	And the thing is, these
64.443	judgments tend to be accurate.
66.542	We're very good at this sort of thing.
68.724	And we're very good at this sort of thing
70.207	because our ability to stereotype people
72.94	is not some sort of arbitrary quirk of the mind,
76.195	but rather it's a specific instance
78.511	of a more general process,
80.166	which is that we have experience
81.785	with things and people in the world
83.326	that fall into categories,
84.575	and we can use our experience
84.575	to make generalizations
87.031	about novel instances of these categories.
89.39	So everybody here has a lot of experience
91.757	with chairs and apples and dogs,
94.01	and based on this, you could see
95.646	unfamiliar examples and you could guess,
97.998	you could sit on the chair,
99.314	you could eat the apple, the dog will bark.
101.879	Now we might be wrong.
103.643	The chair could collapse if you sit on it,
105.443	the apple might be poison, the dog might not bark,
107.665	and in fact, this is my dog Tessie, who doesn't bark.
110.535	But for the most part, we're good at this.
113.294	For the most part, we make good guesses
115.21	both in the social domain and the non-social domain,
117.024	and if we weren't able to do so,
118.973	if we weren't able to make guesses about
118.973	new instances that we encounter,
122.189	we wouldn't survive.
123.64	And in fact, Hazlitt later on in his wonderful essay
126.509	concedes this.
127.994	"He writes, ""Without the aid of prejudice and custom,"
130.536	I should not be able to find
130.536	my way my across the room;
132.876	nor know how to conduct
132.876	myself in any circumstances,
135.328	"nor what to feel in any relation of life."""
139.531	Or take bias.
141.04	Now sometimes, we break the world up into
142.748	us versus them, into in-group versus out-group,
145.749	and sometimes when we do this,
146.91	we know we're doing something wrong,
148.467	and we're kind of ashamed of it.
150.14	But other times we're proud of it.
151.623	We openly acknowledge it.
153.436	And my favorite example of this
154.718	is a question that came from the audience
157.12	in a Republican debate prior to the last election.
159.837	(Video) Anderson Cooper: Gets to your question,
162.129	the question in the hall, on foreign aid? Yes, ma'am.
166.31	Woman: The American people are suffering
168.546	in our country right now.
171.183	Why do we continue to send foreign aid
174.531	to other countries
175.847	when we need all the help we can get for ourselves?
179.95	AC: Governor Perry, what about that?
181.645	(Applause)
183.012	Rick Perry: Absolutely, I think it's—
185.35	Paul Bloom: Each of the people onstage
187.01	agreed with the premise of her question,
188.981	which is as Americans, we should care more
191.1	about Americans than about other people.
193.226	And in fact, in general, people are often swayed
196.091	by feelings of solidarity, loyalty, pride, patriotism,
199.599	towards their country or towards their ethnic group.
202.315	Regardless of your politics, many
202.315	people feel proud to be American,
205.4	and they favor Americans over other countries.
207.462	Residents of other countries
207.462	feel the same about their nation,
210.312	and we feel the same about our ethnicities.
212.798	Now some of you may reject this.
214.482	Some of you may be so cosmopolitan
216.213	that you think that ethnicity and nationality
218.547	should hold no moral sway.
220.7	But even you sophisticates accept
223.462	that there should be some pull
225.296	towards the in-group in the
225.296	domain of friends and family,
227.997	of people you're close to,
229.418	and so even you make a distinction
230.979	between us versus them.
232.954	Now, this distinction is natural enough
235.557	and often moral enough, but it can go awry,
238.481	and this was part of the research
240.21	of the great social psychologist Henri Tajfel.
242.969	Tajfel was born in Poland in 1919.
245.574	He left to go to university in France,
247.713	because as a Jew, he couldn't
247.713	go to university in Poland,
250.268	and then he enlisted in the French military
252.778	in World War II.
254.061	He was captured and ended up
255.83	in a prisoner of war camp,
257.361	and it was a terrifying time for him,
259.628	because if it was discovered that he was a Jew,
261.316	he could have been moved to a concentration camp,
263.408	where he most likely would not have survived.
265.4	And in fact, when the war
265.4	ended and he was released,
267.987	most of his friends and family were dead.
270.492	He got involved in different pursuits.
272.329	He helped out the war orphans.
273.86	But he had a long-lasting interest
275.591	in the science of prejudice,
277.136	and so when a prestigious British scholarship
279.796	on stereotypes opened up, he applied for it,
281.641	and he won it,
282.998	and then he began this amazing career.
285.188	And what started his career is an insight
287.937	that the way most people were thinking
289.777	about the Holocaust was wrong.
291.893	Many people, most people at the time,
294.299	viewed the Holocaust as sort of representing
296.2	some tragic flaw on the part of the Germans,
299.204	some genetic taint, some authoritarian personality.
303.038	And Tajfel rejected this.
305.096	Tajfel said what we see in the Holocaust
307.639	is just an exaggeration
309.95	of normal psychological processes
311.728	that exist in every one of us.
313.489	And to explore this, he did a series of classic studies
316.174	with British adolescents.
317.918	And in one of his studies, what he did was he asked
319.467	the British adolescents all sorts of questions,
322.019	and then based on their answers, he said,
323.903	"""I've looked at your answers,"
323.903	and based on the answers,
326.26	"I have determined that you are either"" —"
328.357	he told half of them —
329.363	"""a Kandinsky lover, you love the work of Kandinsky,"
332.32	"or a Klee lover, you love the work of Klee."""
335.298	It was entirely bogus.
337.114	Their answers had nothing
337.114	to do with Kandinsky or Klee.
339.404	They probably hadn't heard of the artists.
342.132	He just arbitrarily divided them up.
344.872	But what he found was, these categories mattered,
348.143	so when he later gave the subjects money,
350.654	they would prefer to give the money
352.33	to members of their own group
354.13	than members of the other group.
355.963	Worse, they were actually most interested
358.29	in establishing a difference
360.296	between their group and other groups,
362.862	so they would give up money for their own group
364.77	if by doing so they could give
364.77	the other group even less.
370.018	This bias seems to show up very early.
372.236	So my colleague and wife, Karen Wynn, at Yale
374.536	has done a series of studies with babies
376.147	where she exposes babies to puppets,
378.979	and the puppets have certain food preferences.
381.244	So one of the puppets might like green beans.
383.426	The other puppet might like graham crackers.
386.001	They test the babies own food preferences,
388.37	and babies typically prefer the graham crackers.
391.06	But the question is, does this matter to babies
393.672	in how they treat the puppets? And it matters a lot.
396.788	They tend to prefer the puppet
398.307	who has the same food tastes that they have,
401.786	and worse, they actually prefer puppets
404.342	who punish the puppet with the different food taste.
407.327	(Laughter)
409.604	We see this sort of in-group,
409.604	out-group psychology all the time.
413.236	We see it in political clashes
414.9	within groups with different ideologies.
417.314	We see it in its extreme in cases of war,
420.94	where the out-group isn't merely given less,
424.157	but dehumanized,
425.745	as in the Nazi perspective of Jews
427.985	as vermin or lice,
430.07	or the American perspective of Japanese as rats.
434.306	Stereotypes can also go awry.
436.52	So often they're rational and useful,
438.781	but sometimes they're irrational,
440.355	they give the wrong answers,
441.581	and other times
442.798	they lead to plainly immoral consequences.
444.973	And the case that's been most studied
447.781	is the case of race.
449.448	There was a fascinating study
450.855	prior to the 2008 election
452.929	where social psychologists looked at the extent
455.955	to which the candidates were
455.955	associated with America,
459.397	as in an unconscious association
459.397	with the American flag.
463.002	And in one of their studies they compared
464.358	Obama and McCain, and they found McCain
466.372	is thought of as more American than Obama,
469.766	and to some extent, people aren't 
469.766	that surprised by hearing that.
472.339	McCain is a celebrated war hero,
474.257	and many people would explicitly say
475.916	he has more of an American story than Obama.
478.616	But they also compared Obama
480.553	to British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
483.069	and they found that Blair was also thought of
485.33	as more American than Obama,
487.837	even though subjects explicitly understood
489.91	that he's not American at all.
492.9	But they were responding, of course,
494.324	to the color of his skin.
497.375	These stereotypes and biases
499.426	have real-world consequences,
500.876	both subtle and very important.
503.748	In one recent study, researchers
506.41	put ads on eBay for the sale of baseball cards.
509.679	Some of them were held by white hands,
512.413	others by black hands.
513.631	They were the same baseball cards.
515.21	The ones held by black hands
516.454	got substantially smaller bids
518.521	than the ones held by white hands.
521.005	In research done at Stanford,
523.367	psychologists explored the case of people
527.597	sentenced for the murder of a white person.
531.166	It turns out, holding everything else constant,
533.97	you are considerably more likely to be executed
536.34	if you look like the man on the right
538.117	than the man on the left,
540.09	and this is in large part because
542.119	the man on the right looks more prototypically black,
544.653	more prototypically African-American,
547.283	and this apparently influences people's decisions
549.332	over what to do about him.
551.103	So now that we know about this,
552.65	how do we combat it?
554.307	And there are different avenues.
555.929	One avenue is to appeal
557.363	to people's emotional responses,
559.409	to appeal to people's empathy,
561.542	and we often do that through stories.
563.415	So if you are a liberal parent
565.98	and you want to encourage your children
567.852	to believe in the merits of nontraditional families,
570.226	you might give them a book like this.
570.226	"[""Heather Has Two Mommies""]"
572.499	If you are conservative and have a different attitude,
574.225	you might give them a book like this.
576.156	(Laughter)
576.156	"[""Help! Mom! There Are Liberals under My Bed!""]"
577.905	But in general, stories can turn
581.241	anonymous strangers into people who matter,
583.473	and the idea that we care about people
586.158	when we focus on them as individuals
587.86	is an idea which has shown up across history.
590.139	So Stalin apocryphally said,
592.722	"""A single death is a tragedy,"
594.339	"a million deaths is a statistic,"""
596.379	and Mother Teresa said,
597.83	"""If I look at the mass, I will never act."
599.371	"If I look at the one, I will."""
601.696	Psychologists have explored this.
603.766	For instance, in one study,
605.067	people were given a list of facts about a crisis,
607.85	and it was seen how much they would donate
612.106	to solve this crisis,
613.69	and another group was given no facts at all
615.527	but they were told of an individual
617.625	and given a name and given a face,
620.065	and it turns out that they gave far more.
623.284	None of this I think is a secret
625.145	to the people who are engaged in charity work.
627.256	People don't tend to deluge people
629.904	with facts and statistics.
631.227	Rather, you show them faces,
632.249	you show them people.
633.985	It's possible that by extending our sympathies
637.212	to an individual, they can spread
639.183	to the group that the individual belongs to.
642.061	This is Harriet Beecher Stowe.
644.527	The story, perhaps apocryphal,
646.97	is that President Lincoln invited her
649.044	to the White House in the middle of the Civil War
651.042	and said to her,
652.626	"""So you're the little lady who started this great war."""
655.29	"And he was talking about ""Uncle Tom's Cabin."""
657.175	"""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" is not"
657.175	a great book of philosophy
659.706	or of theology or perhaps not even literature,
662.85	but it does a great job
665.365	of getting people to put themselves in the shoes
667.863	of people they wouldn't otherwise be in the shoes of,
670.196	put themselves in the shoes of slaves.
672.598	And that could well have been a catalyst
674.379	for great social change.
675.983	More recently, looking at America
678.345	in the last several decades,
681.414	there's some reason to believe
681.414	"that shows like ""The Cosby Show"""
684.563	radically changed American attitudes
684.563	towards African-Americans,
687.251	"while shows like ""Will and Grace"" and ""Modern Family"""
690.234	changed American attitudes
691.597	towards gay men and women.
692.897	I don't think it's an exaggeration to say
695.352	that the major catalyst in America for moral change
698.013	has been a situation comedy.
700.906	But it's not all emotions,
702.322	and I want to end by appealing
703.598	to the power of reason.
705.833	At some point in his wonderful book
707.989	"""The Better Angels of Our Nature,"""
709.212	Steven Pinker says,
711.228	the Old Testament says love thy neighbor,
713.81	and the New Testament says love thy enemy,
716.532	but I don't love either one of them, not really,
719.218	but I don't want to kill them.
720.885	I know I have obligations to them,
722.751	but my moral feelings to them, my moral beliefs
726.221	about how I should behave towards them,
727.934	aren't grounded in love.
729.981	What they're grounded in is the
729.981	understanding of human rights,
731.92	a belief that their life is as valuable to them
734.143	as my life is to me,
736.499	and to support this, he tells a story
738.431	by the great philosopher Adam Smith,
740.279	and I want to tell this story too,
741.965	though I'm going to modify it a little bit
743.261	for modern times.
744.939	So Adam Smith starts by asking you to imagine
746.84	the death of thousands of people,
748.741	and imagine that the thousands of people
750.781	are in a country you are not familiar with.
753.02	It could be China or India or a country in Africa.
756.574	And Smith says, how would you respond?
759.058	And you would say, well that's too bad,
761.365	and you'd go on to the rest of your life.
763.241	If you were to open up The New
763.241	York Times online or something,
765.46	and discover this, and in fact
765.46	this happens to us all the time,
768.42	we go about our lives.
769.941	But imagine instead, Smith says,
772.135	you were to learn that tomorrow
773.389	you were to have your little finger chopped off.
775.928	Smith says, that would matter a lot.
778.097	You would not sleep that night
779.508	wondering about that.
780.861	So this raises the question:
782.88	Would you sacrifice thousands of lives
785.346	to save your little finger?
787.315	Now answer this in the privacy of your own head,
789.633	but Smith says, absolutely not,
792.552	what a horrid thought.
794.244	And so this raises the question,
796.275	and so, as Smith puts it,
797.649	"""When our passive feelings are almost always"
799.867	so sordid and so selfish,
801.315	how comes it that our active principles
802.78	"should often be so generous and so noble?"""
805.313	"And Smith's answer is, ""It is reason,"
807.363	principle, conscience.
809.138	[This] calls to us,
810.679	with a voice capable of astonishing
810.679	the most presumptuous of our passions,
814.104	that we are but one of the multitude,
815.781	"in no respect better than any other in it."""
818.222	And this last part is what is often described
820.347	as the principle of impartiality.
823.555	And this principle of impartiality manifests itself
826.184	in all of the world's religions,
827.951	in all of the different versions of the golden rule,
830.209	and in all of the world's moral philosophies,
832.663	which differ in many ways
833.97	but share the presupposition
833.97	that we should judge morality
836.964	from sort of an impartial point of view.
839.949	The best articulation of this view
841.771	is actually, for me, it's not from
841.771	a theologian or from a philosopher,
844.856	but from Humphrey Bogart
846.213	"at the end of ""Casablanca."""
847.76	So, spoiler alert, he's telling his lover
851.536	that they have to separate
852.676	for the more general good,
854.269	and he says to her, and I won't do the accent,
856.133	"but he says to her, ""It doesn't take much to see"
857.915	that the problems of three little people
859.274	"don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world."""
862.385	Our reason could cause us to override our passions.
865.665	Our reason could motivate us
867.381	to extend our empathy,
868.602	could motivate us to write a
868.602	"book like ""Uncle Tom's Cabin,"""
870.929	"or read a book like ""Uncle Tom's Cabin,"""
872.652	and our reason can motivate us to create
875.346	customs and taboos and laws
877.308	that will constrain us
879.118	from acting upon our impulses
880.794	when, as rational beings, we feel
882.383	we should be constrained.
883.778	This is what a constitution is.
885.791	A constitution is something
885.791	which was set up in the past
888.712	that applies now in the present,
890.019	and what it says is,
891.004	no matter how much we might to reelect
893.231	a popular president for a third term,
895.834	no matter how much white Americans might choose
897.929	to feel that they want to reinstate
897.929	the institution of slavery, we can't.
901.997	We have bound ourselves.
903.673	And we bind ourselves in other ways as well.
906.09	We know that when it comes to choosing somebody
908.848	for a job, for an award,
911.799	we are strongly biased by their race,
914.757	we are biased by their gender,
917.053	we are biased by how attractive they are,
919.268	and sometimes we might say,
919.268	"""Well fine, that's the way it should be."""
921.919	"But other times we say, ""This is wrong."""
924.226	And so to combat this,
926.115	we don't just try harder,
928.366	but rather what we do is we set up situations
931.367	where these other sources
931.367	of information can't bias us,
934.406	which is why many orchestras
935.721	audition musicians behind screens,
938.366	so the only information they have
939.61	is the information they believe should matter.
942.303	I think prejudice and bias
944.626	illustrate a fundamental duality of human nature.
947.72	We have gut feelings, instincts, emotions,
951.496	and they affect our judgments and our actions
953.657	for good and for evil,
955.988	but we are also capable of rational deliberation
959.61	and intelligent planning,
961.045	and we can use these to, in some cases,
963.862	accelerate and nourish our emotions,
965.805	and in other cases staunch them.
968.573	And it's in this way
969.807	that reason helps us create a better world.
972.574	Thank you.
