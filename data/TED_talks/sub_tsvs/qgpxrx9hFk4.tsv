12.58	For the last five years,
14.26	I have documented the lives
14.26	of teenage mothers in Latin America.
19.22	I started with a series of photographs
22.34	about the moment of birth
24.06	in my country, Uruguay.
29.1	(Video) (Screaming)
33.58	(Grunting)
36.94	(Newborn crying)
50.42	I am the son of a teenage mother
53.1	and my sister became
53.1	a teenage mother when she was 16.
57.22	I began exploring the theme
59.18	to better understand
59.18	myself and my origins.
64.06	In developing countries,
66.26	7.3 million girls under the age of 18
70.42	give birth each year.
72.9	Projections suggest
74.5	that the teen pregnancy rate
74.5	in Latin America
77.22	will be the highest in the world
79.26	for the next 80 years.
81.54	In Mexico, almost one in two
81.54	sexually active adolescents
86.5	get pregnant between the ages
86.5	of 12 to 19 years old.
91.54	Teenage pregnancy
91.54	is not just about young pregnancies.
95.3	It is about gender violence,
97.46	physical, symbolic, psychological
97.46	and economic violence.
103.18	Girls who become pregnant
103.18	before they are 18
105.86	rarely achieve an adequate
105.86	standard of living.
109.86	The pattern of poverty
111.54	and limited access
111.54	to education and health care
114.42	are a common thread
114.42	among teen pregnancies.
117.74	If a girl in Latin America
117.74	gets pregnant before she is 16,
122.22	the risk of maternal death
122.22	increases fourfold
125.7	over a woman in their 20s.
128.94	And somehow, in spite of all this,
132.7	motherhood also imparts a status
135.74	and a respect to the adolescent
135.74	in her community.
140.26	Her child becomes her life project.
144.98	A high percentage of girls
144.98	under the age of 18 are single mothers,
149.46	as was my mother.
151.54	When I was learning to be a parent,
153.62	I began to focus on the relationship
153.62	between father and child,
158.02	a subject rarely given much attention.
161.9	I wanted to highlight the ways
163.9	in which we need
163.9	to educate boys differently
166.58	without turning them into macho men.
169.38	In some cases, families
169.38	send boys to school but not girls.
173.98	The persistence of teen pregnancy
173.98	heightened the gender equity gap
178.5	and the continued existence
178.5	of traditional roles.
182.82	If we were to allow
182.82	equal opportunities to girls,
186.14	they could gain independence.
189.3	Educating girls is key
191.82	to breaking cycles of teen pregnancies.
196.34	Girls getting pregnant
196.34	between the ages of 10 to 14
200.66	are an extremely vulnerable population,
203.46	and they can be easy prey
203.46	for men twice their age.
206.82	There are many cases of violence,
209.14	incest and sexual abuse
211.22	perpetrated against this group.
214.46	This is Gloria.
215.86	She became a teen mother at the age of 12,
218.38	a result of the ongoing
218.38	abuse by her father,
221.22	who was also raping Gloria's two sisters,
223.9	ages 8 and 16.
227.42	In this portrait,
227.42	she has butterflies in her hair,
231.7	symbols of resurrection.
234.06	For me, it's extremely important
234.06	to portray this mother with dignity.
240.58	Pregnancies among girls
240.58	younger than 15 is a growing trend,
244.14	not only in Latin America,
245.7	but many developing
245.7	countries in the world.
248.86	Our region is marred
248.86	by bad social and cultural inequalities,
253.82	and teen pregnancy
253.82	further increases this divide.
258.06	I am committing
258.06	to being part of the solution
260.22	by making work that implicitly
260.22	and emphatically
263.1	calls for human rights for girls.
266.74	The day life projects
266.74	for boys and girls become similar,
271.899	teenage pregnancy will decrease.
273.82	Thank you.
275.06	(Applause)
