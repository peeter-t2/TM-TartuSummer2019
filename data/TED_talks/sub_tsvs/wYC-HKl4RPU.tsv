12.84	Science.
14.76	The very word for many of you conjures
14.76	unhappy memories of boredom
18.2	in high school biology or physics class.
21.12	But let me assure that what you did there
24.24	had very little to do with science.
26.44	"That was really the ""what"" of science."
28.76	It was the history
28.76	of what other people had discovered.
32.72	What I'm most interested in as a scientist
35.08	"is the ""how"" of science."
37.24	Because science is knowledge in process.
41.08	We make an observation,
41.08	guess an explanation for that observation,
44.56	and then make a prediction
44.56	that we can test
46.64	with an experiment or other observation.
49.08	A couple of examples.
50.44	First of all, people noticed
50.44	that the Earth was below, the sky above,
54.04	and both the Sun and the Moon
54.04	seemed to go around them.
58.72	Their guessed explanation
60.28	was that the Earth must be
60.28	the center of the universe.
64.24	The prediction: everything
64.24	should circle around the Earth.
68.12	This was first really tested
69.8	when Galileo got his hands
69.8	on one of the first telescopes,
72.64	and as he gazed into the night sky,
75.04	what he found there was a planet, Jupiter,
78.76	with four moons circling around it.
83.76	He then used those moons
83.76	to follow the path of Jupiter
88.16	and found that Jupiter
88.16	also was not going around the Earth
91.92	but around the Sun.
95.16	So the prediction test failed.
98.4	And this led to
98.4	the discarding of the theory
100.52	that the Earth was the center
100.52	of the universe.
102.72	Another example: Sir Isaac Newton
102.72	noticed that things fall to the Earth.
106.84	The guessed explanation was gravity,
110.52	the prediction that everything
110.52	should fall to the Earth.
113.68	But of course, not everything
113.68	does fall to the Earth.
118.2	So did we discard gravity?
120.92	No. We revised the theory and said,
120.92	gravity pulls things to the Earth
125.36	unless there is an equal
125.36	and opposite force in the other direction.
130.16	This led us to learn something new.
132.92	We began to pay more attention
132.92	to the bird and the bird's wings,
136.2	and just think of all the discoveries
138.6	that have flown
138.6	from that line of thinking.
141.639	So the test failures,
141.639	the exceptions, the outliers
146.8	teach us what we don't know
146.8	and lead us to something new.
152	This is how science moves forward.
152	This is how science learns.
155.84	Sometimes in the media,
155.84	and even more rarely,
158.12	but sometimes even scientists will say
160.56	that something or other
160.56	has been scientifically proven.
163.88	But I hope that you understand
163.88	that science never proves anything
168.48	definitively forever.
171.52	Hopefully science remains curious enough
175.36	to look for
176.8	and humble enough to recognize
178.8	when we have found
180.32	the next outlier,
182.04	the next exception,
183.56	which, like Jupiter's moons,
185.88	teaches us what we don't actually know.
189.16	We're going to change gears
189.16	here for a second.
191.72	The caduceus, or the symbol of medicine,
193.68	means a lot of different things
193.68	to different people,
196.16	but most of our
196.16	public discourse on medicine
198.44	really turns it into
198.44	an engineering problem.
201.24	We have the hallways of Congress,
203	and the boardrooms of insurance companies
203	that try to figure out how to pay for it.
207.68	The ethicists and epidemiologists
209.32	try to figure out
209.32	how best to distribute medicine,
212.04	and the hospitals and physicians
212.04	are absolutely obsessed
214.72	with their protocols and checklists,
216.68	trying to figure out
216.68	how best to safely apply medicine.
220.24	These are all good things.
222.96	However, they also all assume
225.72	at some level
227.72	that the textbook of medicine is closed.
231.16	We start to measure
231.16	the quality of our health care
233.68	by how quickly we can access it.
236.24	It doesn't surprise me
236.24	that in this climate,
238.36	many of our institutions
238.36	for the provision of health care
241.2	start to look a heck of a lot
241.2	like Jiffy Lube.
243.72	(Laughter)
246.32	The only problem is that
246.32	when I graduated from medical school,
250.28	I didn't get one of those
250.28	little doohickeys
252.36	that your mechanic
252.36	has to plug into your car
254.76	and find out exactly what's wrong with it,
257.16	because the textbook of medicine
259.28	is not closed.
261.32	Medicine is science.
263.56	Medicine is knowledge in process.
267.28	We make an observation,
268.68	we guess an explanation
268.68	of that observation,
270.839	and then we make a prediction
270.839	that we can test.
273.48	Now, the testing ground
273.48	of most predictions in medicine
277.08	is populations.
278.64	And you may remember
278.64	from those boring days in biology class
282.24	that populations tend to distribute
284.44	around a mean
285.68	as a Gaussian or a normal curve.
287.56	Therefore, in medicine,
289.24	after we make a prediction
289.24	from a guessed explanation,
292.48	we test it in a population.
295.32	That means that what we know in medicine,
298.28	our knowledge and our know-how,
300.56	comes from populations
302.84	but extends only as far
305.64	as the next outlier,
307.4	the next exception,
308.64	which, like Jupiter's moons,
310.4	will teach us what we don't actually know.
314.08	Now, I am a surgeon
315.44	who looks after patients with sarcoma.
317.88	Sarcoma is a very rare form of cancer.
320.72	It's the cancer of flesh and bones.
323.24	And I would tell you that every one
323.24	of my patients is an outlier,
327.6	is an exception.
330	There is no surgery I have ever performed
330	for a sarcoma patient
333.24	that has ever been guided
333.24	by a randomized controlled clinical trial,
337.52	what we consider the best kind
337.52	of population-based evidence in medicine.
342.4	People talk about thinking
342.4	outside the box,
344.72	but we don't even have a box in sarcoma.
347.48	What we do have as we take
347.48	a bath in the uncertainty
350.84	and unknowns and exceptions
350.84	and outliers that surround us in sarcoma
355	is easy access to what I think
355	are those two most important values
359.56	for any science:
361.12	humility and curiosity.
364	Because if I am humble and curious,
366.32	when a patient asks me a question,
368.64	and I don't know the answer,
370.92	I'll ask a colleague
372.16	who may have a similar
372.16	albeit distinct patient with sarcoma.
375.2	We'll even establish
375.2	international collaborations.
377.92	Those patients will start
377.92	to talk to each other through chat rooms
381.08	and support groups.
382.8	It's through this kind
382.8	of humbly curious communication
386.4	that we begin to try and learn new things.
391.24	As an example, this is a patient of mine
393.32	who had a cancer near his knee.
395.48	Because of humbly curious communication
397.88	in international collaborations,
400	we have learned that we can repurpose
400	the ankle to serve as the knee
404.56	when we have to remove the knee
404.56	with the cancer.
406.84	He can then wear a prosthetic
406.84	and run and jump and play.
410.36	This opportunity was available to him
413.4	because of international collaborations.
416.2	It was desirable to him
417.92	because he had contacted other patients
417.92	who had experienced it.
421.92	And so exceptions and outliers in medicine
426	teach us what we don't know,
426	but also lead us to new thinking.
431.08	Now, very importantly,
432.96	all the new thinking that outliers
432.96	and exceptions lead us to in medicine
436.84	does not only apply
436.84	to the outliers and exceptions.
440.92	It is not that we only learn
440.92	from sarcoma patients
444.12	ways to manage sarcoma patients.
446.92	Sometimes, the outliers
449	and the exceptions
450.72	teach us things that matter quite a lot
450.72	to the general population.
455.36	Like a tree standing outside a forest,
457.24	the outliers and the exceptions
457.24	draw our attention
461.28	and lead us into a much greater sense
461.28	of perhaps what a tree is.
465.64	We often talk about
465.64	losing the forests for the trees,
468.16	but one also loses a tree
470	within a forest.
473	But the tree that stands out by itself
474.88	makes those relationships
474.88	that define a tree,
477.8	the relationships between trunk
477.8	and roots and branches,
481.64	much more apparent.
483.36	Even if that tree is crooked
485.08	or even if that tree
485.08	has very unusual relationships
488.08	between trunk and roots and branches,
490.4	it nonetheless draws our attention
493.12	and allows us to make observations
495.04	that we can then test
495.04	in the general population.
498	I told you that sarcomas are rare.
500	They make up about one percent
500	of all cancers.
503.28	You also probably know that cancer
503.28	is considered a genetic disease.
507.84	By genetic disease we mean
507.84	that cancer is caused by oncogenes
511.2	that are turned on in cancer
512.6	and tumor suppressor genes
512.6	that are turned off to cause cancer.
516.16	You might think
516.16	that we learned about oncogenes
518.6	and tumor suppressor genes
518.6	from common cancers
520.84	like breast cancer and prostate cancer
522.84	and lung cancer,
524.36	but you'd be wrong.
526	We learned about oncogenes
526	and tumor suppressor genes
528.919	for the first time
530.159	in that itty-bitty little one percent
530.159	of cancers called sarcoma.
534.76	In 1966, Peyton Rous got the Nobel Prize
537.36	for realizing that chickens
539.4	had a transmissible form of sarcoma.
543.26	Thirty years later, Harold Varmus
543.26	and Mike Bishop discovered
546.12	what that transmissible element was.
548.68	It was a virus
550.28	carrying a gene,
551.72	the src oncogene.
553.88	Now, I will not tell you
553.88	that src is the most important oncogene.
557.56	I will not tell you
558.8	that src is the most frequently
558.8	turned on oncogene in all of cancer.
562.32	But it was the first oncogene.
565.96	The exception, the outlier
568.32	drew our attention and led us to something
571.52	that taught us very important things
571.52	about the rest of biology.
576.88	Now, TP53 is the most important
576.88	tumor suppressor gene.
581	It is the most frequently turned off
581	tumor suppressor gene
583.76	in almost every kind of cancer.
586.36	But we didn't learn about it
586.36	from common cancers.
588.68	We learned about it
588.68	when doctors Li and Fraumeni
591.12	were looking at families,
592.72	and they realized that these families
594.76	had way too many sarcomas.
597.92	I told you that sarcoma is rare.
599.72	Remember that a one
599.72	in a million diagnosis,
602.92	if it happens twice in one family,
605.08	is way too common in that family.
608.64	The very fact that these are rare
611.36	draws our attention
613.76	and leads us to new kinds of thinking.
617.48	Now, many of you may say,
618.96	and may rightly say,
620.52	that yeah, Kevin, that's great,
622.44	but you're not talking
622.44	about a bird's wing.
624.52	You're not talking about moons
624.52	floating around some planet Jupiter.
628.52	This is a person.
630.08	This outlier, this exception,
630.08	may lead to the advancement of science,
633.36	but this is a person.
636.28	And all I can say
637.92	is that I know that all too well.
641.76	I have conversations with these patients
641.76	with rare and deadly diseases.
645.8	I write about these conversations.
647.76	These conversations are terribly fraught.
650.08	They're fraught with horrible phrases
651.92	"like ""I have bad news"""
651.92	"or ""There's nothing more we can do."""
655.76	Sometimes these conversations
655.76	turn on a single word:
659.76	"""terminal."""
664.92	Silence can also be rather uncomfortable.
669.36	Where the blanks are in medicine
671.96	can be just as important
673.84	as the words that we use
673.84	in these conversations.
677.08	What are the unknowns?
678.64	What are the experiments
678.64	that are being done?
681.68	Do this little exercise with me.
683.4	Up there on the screen,
683.4	"you see this phrase, ""no where."""
686.64	Notice where the blank is.
688.68	If we move that blank one space over
692.64	"""no where"""
694.24	"becomes ""now here,"""
696.96	the exact opposite meaning,
698.88	just by shifting the blank one space over.
703.68	I'll never forget the night
705.28	that I walked into
705.28	one of my patients' rooms.
708.28	I had been operating long that day
709.96	but I still wanted to come and see him.
712	He was a boy I had diagnosed
712	with a bone cancer a few days before.
715.84	He and his mother had been meeting
715.84	with the chemotherapy doctors
718.92	earlier that day,
720.16	and he had been admitted
720.16	to the hospital to begin chemotherapy.
723.16	It was almost midnight
723.16	when I got to his room.
725.36	He was asleep, but I found his mother
727.56	reading by flashlight
729.16	next to his bed.
730.64	She came out in the hall
730.64	to chat with me for a few minutes.
734.28	It turned out that
734.28	what she had been reading
736.4	was the protocol
736.4	that the chemotherapy doctors
738.6	had given her that day.
740.2	She had memorized it.
743.2	"She said, ""Dr. Jones, you told me"
746.76	that we don't always win
748.96	with this type of cancer,
751.68	but I've been studying this protocol,
751.68	and I think I can do it.
755.96	I think I can comply
755.96	with these very difficult treatments.
759.56	I'm going to quit my job.
759.56	I'm going to move in with my parents.
762.56	"I'm going to keep my baby safe."""
767.32	I didn't tell her.
769.84	I didn't stop to correct her thinking.
773.68	She was trusting in a protocol
775.96	that even if complied with,
779.2	wouldn't necessarily save her son.
783.96	I didn't tell her.
786.36	I didn't fill in that blank.
789.08	But a year and a half later
791.08	her boy nonetheless died of his cancer.
795.4	Should I have told her?
797.36	"Now, many of you may say, ""So what?"
799.64	I don't have sarcoma.
800.92	No one in my family has sarcoma.
802.84	And this is all fine and well,
804.32	but it probably doesn't
804.32	"matter in my life."""
807.04	And you're probably right.
808.32	Sarcoma may not matter
808.32	a whole lot in your life.
813.04	But where the blanks are in medicine
815.4	does matter in your life.
818.52	I didn't tell you one dirty little secret.
820.84	I told you that in medicine,
820.84	we test predictions in populations,
825.24	but I didn't tell you,
826.52	and so often medicine never tells you
828.76	that every time an individual
831.64	encounters medicine,
833.76	even if that individual is firmly
833.76	embedded in the general population,
839.36	neither the individual
839.36	nor the physician knows
841.76	where in that population
841.76	the individual will land.
845.04	Therefore, every encounter with medicine
847.76	is an experiment.
849.92	You will be a subject
851.96	in an experiment.
854.56	And the outcome will be either
854.56	a better or a worse result for you.
860.32	As long as medicine works well,
862.36	we're fine with fast service,
865.4	bravado, brimmingly
865.4	confident conversations.
869.72	But when things don't work well,
871.4	sometimes we want something different.
874.52	A colleague of mine
874.52	removed a tumor from a patient's limb.
878.92	He was concerned about this tumor.
880.76	In our physician conferences,
880.76	he talked about his concern
883.8	that this was a type of tumor
885.24	that had a high risk
885.24	for coming back in the same limb.
888.68	But his conversations with the patient
890.68	were exactly what a patient might want:
892.8	brimming with confidence.
894.08	"He said, ""I got it all"
894.08	"and you're good to go."""
897.12	She and her husband were thrilled.
898.88	They went out, celebrated, fancy dinner,
898.88	opened a bottle of champagne.
904.04	The only problem was a few weeks later,
906.36	she started to notice
906.36	another nodule in the same area.
909.48	It turned out he hadn't gotten it all,
909.48	and she wasn't good to go.
913.64	But what happened at this juncture
913.64	absolutely fascinates me.
917.2	My colleague came to me and said,
918.84	"""Kevin, would you mind"
918.84	"looking after this patient for me?"""
922.24	"I said, ""Why, you know the right thing"
922.24	to do as well as I do.
925.48	"You haven't done anything wrong."""
927.12	"He said, ""Please, just look"
927.12	"after this patient for me."""
933.2	He was embarrassed --
934.76	not by what he had done,
937.154	but by the conversation that he had had,
939.76	by the overconfidence.
942.6	So I performed
942.6	a much more invasive surgery
945.24	and had a very different conversation
945.24	with the patient afterwards.
948.4	"I said, ""Most likely I've gotten it all"
950.76	and you're most likely good to go,
953.2	but this is the experiment
953.2	that we're doing.
957.04	This is what you're going to watch for.
959.08	This is what I'm going to watch for.
961	And we're going to work together
961	to find out if this surgery will work
964.96	"to get rid of your cancer."""
966.92	I can guarantee you, she and her husband
968.88	did not crack another bottle of champagne
968.88	after talking to me.
973.6	But she was now a scientist,
976.48	not only a subject in her experiment.
981.96	And so I encourage you
983.6	to seek humility and curiosity
987.08	in your physicians.
988.76	Almost 20 billion times each year,
991.76	a person walks into a doctor's office,
995.72	and that person becomes a patient.
999.32	You or someone you love
999.32	will be that patient sometime very soon.
1003.84	How will you talk to your doctors?
1006.64	What will you tell them?
1008.76	What will they tell you?
1012.6	They cannot tell you
1014.84	what they do not know,
1017.56	but they can tell you when they don't know
1022.28	if only you'll ask.
1024.16	So please, join the conversation.
1028.2	Thank you.
1029.44	(Applause)
