12.578	Look, I had second thoughts, really,
14.601	about whether I could talk about this
16.636	to such a vital and alive audience as you guys.
19.676	Then I remembered the quote from Gloria Steinem,
22.266	which goes,
23.905	"""The truth will set you free,"
25.836	"but first it will piss you off."" (Laughter)"
29.795	So -- (Laughter)
32.063	So with that in mind, I'm going to set about
34.187	trying to do those things here,
35.778	and talk about dying in the 21st century.
37.64	Now the first thing that will piss you off, undoubtedly,
40.04	is that all of us are, in fact, going to die
42.659	in the 21st century.
43.733	There will be no exceptions to that.
46.123	There are, apparently, about one in eight of you
48.78	who think you're immortal, on surveys, but --
51.304	(Laughter)
53.482	Unfortunately, that isn't going to happen.
58.095	While I give this talk, in the next 10 minutes,
59.748	a hundred million of my cells will die,
63.244	and over the course of today, 2,000 of my brain cells
65.838	will die and never come back,
67.979	so you could argue that the dying process
70.06	starts pretty early in the piece.
72.138	Anyway, the second thing I want to say about dying in the
76.617	is it's shaping up to be a bit of a train wreck
79.233	for most of us,
81.578	unless we do something to try and reclaim this process
84.547	from the rather inexorable trajectory that it's currently on.
88.264	So there you go. That's the truth.
90.072	No doubt that will piss you off, and now let's see
91.503	whether we can set you free. I don't promise anything.
94.479	Now, as you heard in the intro, I work in intensive care,
97.062	and I think I've kind of lived through the heyday
100.166	of intensive care. It's been a ride, man.
102.173	This has been fantastic.
103.373	We have machines that go ping.
104.528	There's many of them up there.
106.838	And we have some wizard technology which I think
109.582	has worked really well, and over the course of the time
112.094	I've worked in intensive care, the death rate
114.166	for males in Australia has halved,
116.536	and intensive care has had something to do with that.
118.155	Certainly, a lot of the technologies that we use
120.163	have got something to do with that.
122.383	So we have had tremendous success, and we kind of
124.887	got caught up in our own success quite a bit,
127.241	"and we started using expressions like ""lifesaving."""
130.865	I really apologize to everybody for doing that,
132.999	because obviously, we don't.
134.229	What we do is prolong people's lives,
136.757	and delay death,
138.858	and redirect death, but we can't, strictly speaking,
141.703	save lives on any sort of permanent basis.
144.558	And what's really happened over the period of time
146.543	that I've been working in intensive care is that
149.182	the people whose lives we started saving back in the '70s,
152.752	'80s, and '90s, are now coming to die in the 21st century
157.23	of diseases that we no longer have the answers to
160.83	in quite the way we did then.
163.34	So what's happening now is there's been a big shift
165.215	in the way that people die,
167.022	and most of what they're dying of now isn't as amenable
169.293	to what we can do as what it used to be like
172.119	when I was doing this in the '80s and '90s.
176.03	So we kind of got a bit caught up with this,
178.894	and we haven't really squared with you guys about
181.927	what's really happening now, and it's about time we did.
185.982	I kind of woke up to this bit in the late '90s
189.373	when I met this guy.
191.467	This guy is called Jim, Jim Smith, and he looked like this.
195.824	I was called down to the ward to see him.
198.127	His is the little hand.
200.372	I was called down to the ward to see him
201.758	by a respiratory physician.
202.852	"He said, ""Look, there's a guy down here."
205.028	He's got pneumonia,
206.628	and he looks like he needs intensive care.
209.133	His daughter's here and she wants everything possible
211.207	"to be done."""
213.738	Which is a familiar phrase to us.
216.357	So I go down to the ward and see Jim,
218.188	and his skin his translucent like this.
219.873	You can see his bones through the skin.
222.123	He's very, very thin,
223.661	and he is, indeed, very sick with pneumonia,
227.043	and he's too sick to talk to me,
228.524	so I talk to his daughter Kathleen, and I say to her,
233.674	"""Did you and Jim ever talk about"
236.638	what you would want done
238.321	"if he ended up in this kind of situation?"""
240.335	"And she looked at me and said, ""No, of course not!"""
244.064	"I thought, ""Okay. Take this steady."""
249.124	And I got talking to her, and after a while, she said to me,
251.968	"""You know, we always thought there'd be time."""
254.971	Jim was 94. (Laughter)
258.737	And I realized that something wasn't happening here.
261.271	There wasn't this dialogue going on
262.595	that I imagined was happening.
265.248	So a group of us started doing survey work,
268.255	and we looked at four and a half thousand nursing home
270.475	residents in Newcastle, in the Newcastle area,
273.815	and discovered that only one in a hundred of them
276.762	had a plan about what to do when their hearts stopped beating.
279.827	One in a hundred.
280.966	And only one in 500 of them had plan about what to do
284.307	if they became seriously ill.
287.404	And I realized, of course, this dialogue
290.164	is definitely not occurring in the public at large.
294.8	Now, I work in acute care.
296.278	This is John Hunter Hospital.
298.383	And I thought, surely, we do better than that.
302.384	So a colleague of mine from nursing called Lisa Shaw and I
305.38	went through hundreds and hundreds of sets of notes
307.896	in the medical records department
309.169	looking at whether there was any sign at all
311.79	that anybody had had any conversation about
314.218	what might happen to them if the treatment they were
316.071	receiving was unsuccessful to the point that they would die.
319.415	And we didn't find a single record of any preference
322.356	about goals, treatments or outcomes from any
326.2	of the sets of notes initiated by a doctor or by a patient.
330.77	So we started to realize
333.487	that we had a problem,
335.688	and the problem is more serious because of this.
340.711	What we know is that obviously we are all going to die,
344.013	but how we die is actually really important,
346.678	obviously not just to us, but also to how that
350.233	features in the lives of all the people who live on afterwards.
353.367	How we die lives on in the minds of everybody
355.688	who survives us, and
358.805	the stress created in families by dying is enormous,
362.537	and in fact you get seven times as much stress by dying
365.223	in intensive care as by dying just about anywhere else,
367.96	so dying in intensive care is not your top option
371.038	if you've got a choice.
373.496	And, if that wasn't bad enough, of course,
375.665	all of this is rapidly progressing towards the fact that
378.313	many of you, in fact, about one in 10 of you at this point,
380.665	will die in intensive care.
382.115	In the U.S., it's one in five.
383.449	In Miami, it's three out of five people die in intensive care.
387.199	So this is the sort of momentum
389.264	that we've got at the moment.
391.552	The reason why this is all happening is due to this,
394.097	and I do have to take you through what this is about.
395.399	These are the four ways to go.
397.364	So one of these will happen to all of us.
400.229	The ones you may know most about are the ones
402.759	that are becoming increasingly of historical interest:
405.605	sudden death.
407.022	It's quite likely in an audience this size
408.467	this won't happen to anybody here.
411.018	Sudden death has become very rare.
412.748	The death of Little Nell and Cordelia and all that sort of stuff
415.203	just doesn't happen anymore.
416.876	The dying process of those with terminal illness
419.293	that we've just seen
420.325	occurs to younger people.
421.94	By the time you've reached 80, this is unlikely to happen to you.
424.79	Only one in 10 people who are over 80 will die of cancer.
428.205	The big growth industry are these.
433.04	What you die of is increasing organ failure,
436.291	with your respiratory, cardiac, renal,
438.526	whatever organs packing up. Each of these
440.306	would be an admission to an acute care hospital,
442.909	at the end of which, or at some point during which,
444.878	somebody says, enough is enough, and we stop.
447.054	And this one's the biggest growth industry of all,
449.622	and at least six out of 10 of the people in this room
452.197	will die in this form, which is
454.759	the dwindling of capacity
458.653	with increasing frailty,
460.972	and frailty's an inevitable part of aging,
463.222	and increasing frailty is in fact the main thing
465.775	that people die of now,
466.824	and the last few years, or the last year of your life
468.952	is spent with a great deal of disability, unfortunately.
472.967	Enjoying it so far? (Laughs)
476.351	(Laughter)
479.504	Sorry, I just feel such a, I feel such a Cassandra here.
482.932	(Laughter)
488.09	What can I say that's positive? What's positive is
489.149	that this is happening at very great age, now.
491.564	We are all, most of us, living to reach this point.
494.309	You know, historically, we didn't do that.
496.197	This is what happens to you
497.666	when you live to be a great age,
500.189	and unfortunately, increasing longevity does mean
502.078	more old age, not more youth.
504.005	I'm sorry to say that. (Laughter)
510.098	What we did, anyway, look, what we did,
511.895	we didn't just take this lying down
513.422	at John Hunter Hospital and elsewhere.
514.924	We've started a whole series of projects
516.546	to try and look about whether we could, in fact, involve
519.542	people much more in the way that things happen to them.
523.036	But we realized, of course, that we are dealing
524.268	with cultural issues,
526.612	and this is, I love this Klimt painting,
528.471	because the more you look at it, the more you kind of get
530.676	the whole issue that's going on here,
532.695	which is clearly the separation of death from the living,
536.213	and the fear — Like, if you actually look,
538.093	there's one woman there
539.268	who has her eyes open.
541.187	She's the one he's looking at,
542.872	and [she's] the one he's coming for. Can you see that?
546.1	She looks terrified.
547.626	It's an amazing picture.
549.319	Anyway, we had a major cultural issue.
551.54	Clearly, people didn't want us to talk about death,
553.524	or, we thought that.
555.019	So with loads of funding from the Federal Government
556.966	and the local Health Service, we introduced a thing
558.386	at John Hunter called Respecting Patient Choices.
561.284	We trained hundreds of people to go to the wards
564.133	and talk to people about the fact that they would die,
567.276	and what would they prefer under those circumstances.
569.562	They loved it. The families and the patients, they loved it.
573.081	Ninety-eight percent of people really thought
575.541	this just should have been normal practice,
576.995	and that this is how things should work.
579.378	And when they expressed wishes,
581.316	all of those wishes came true, as it were.
583.289	We were able to make that happen for them.
585.269	But then, when the funding ran out,
587.519	we went back to look six months later,
589.604	and everybody had stopped again,
591.871	and nobody was having these conversations anymore.
595.064	So that was really kind of heartbreaking for us,
597.117	because we thought this was going to really take off.
599.834	The cultural issue had reasserted itself.
603.805	So here's the pitch:
604.96	I think it's important that we don't just get on this freeway
609.046	to ICU without thinking hard about whether or not
611.545	that's where we all want to end up,
613.338	particularly as we become older and increasingly frail
615.474	and ICU has less and less and less to offer us.
619.128	There has to be a little side road
621.458	off there for people who don't want to go on that track.
625.933	And I have one small idea,
628.569	and one big idea about what could happen.
633.018	And this is the small idea.
634.079	The small idea is, let's all of us
636.86	engage more with this in the way that Jason has illustrated.
640.796	Why can't we have these kinds of conversations
642.849	with our own elders
644.17	and people who might be approaching this?
646.96	There are a couple of things you can do.
648.794	One of them is, you can,
650.925	just ask this simple question. This question never fails.
653.839	"""In the event that you became too sick to speak for yourself,"
657.594	"who would you like to speak for you?"""
660.527	That's a really important question to ask people,
662.441	because giving people the control over who that is
664.464	produces an amazing outcome.
667.772	The second thing you can say is,
668.918	"""Have you spoken to that person"
670.416	about the things that are important to you
672.336	"so that we've got a better idea of what it is we can do?"""
676.49	So that's the little idea.
679.012	The big idea, I think, is more political.
680.506	I think we have to get onto this.
682.457	I suggested we should have Occupy Death.
685.519	(Laughter)
688.304	"My wife said, ""Yeah, right, sit-ins in the mortuary."
690.874	"Yeah, yeah. Sure."" (Laughter)"
693.453	So that one didn't really run,
695.318	but I was very struck by this.
696.988	Now, I'm an aging hippie.
698.701	I don't know, I don't think I look like that anymore, but
701.198	I had, two of my kids were born at home in the '80s
703.698	when home birth was a big thing, and we baby boomers
707.166	are used to taking charge of the situation,
709.862	so if you just replace all these words of birth,
713.26	"I like ""Peace, Love, Natural Death"" as an option."
716.341	I do think we have to get political
717.857	and start to reclaim this process from
720.455	the medicalized model in which it's going.
722.422	Now, listen, that sounds like a pitch for euthanasia.
724.462	I want to make it absolutely crystal clear to you all,
726.654	I hate euthanasia. I think it's a sideshow.
729.318	I don't think euthanasia matters.
731.505	I actually think that,
733.656	in places like Oregon,
736.205	where you can have physician-assisted suicide,
739.677	you take a poisonous dose of stuff,
741.894	only half a percent of people ever do that.
743.77	I'm more interested in what happens to the 99.5 percent
746.476	of people who don't want to do that.
748.232	I think most people don't want to be dead,
750.566	but I do think most people want to have some control
752.663	over how their dying process proceeds.
755.405	So I'm an opponent of euthanasia,
756.545	but I do think we have to give people back some control.
759.198	It deprives euthanasia of its oxygen supply.
762.671	I think we should be looking at stopping
764.023	the want for euthanasia,
765.062	not for making it illegal or legal or worrying about it at all.
769.757	This is a quote from Dame Cicely Saunders,
773.333	whom I met when I was a medical student.
774.702	She founded the hospice movement.
777.581	"And she said, ""You matter because you are,"
779.772	"and you matter to the last moment of your life."""
782.294	And I firmly believe that
784.551	that's the message that we have to carry forward.
787.637	Thank you. (Applause)
