15.486	So I want to talk to you about two things tonight.
19.308	Number one:
21.592	Teaching surgery and doing surgery
24.908	is really hard.
27.041	And second,
28.625	that language is one of the most profound things
31.124	that separate us all over the world.
34.442	And in my little corner of the world,
36.359	these two things are actually related,
38.309	and I want to tell you how tonight.
40.241	Now, nobody wants an operation.
44.247	Who here has had surgery?
48.186	Did you want it?
49.509	Keep your hands up if you wanted an operation.
51.067	Nobody wants an operation.
53.159	In particular, nobody wants an operation
56.221	with tools like these through large incisions
61.709	that cause a lot of pain,
63.684	that cause a lot of time out of work or out of school,
67.216	that leave a big scar.
69.467	But if you have to have an operation,
72.369	what you really want is a minimally invasive operation.
74.9	That's what I want to talk to you about tonight --
76.932	how doing and teaching this type of surgery
79.666	led us on a search
81.133	for a better universal translator.
83.667	Now, this type of surgery is hard,
86.01	and it starts by putting people to sleep,
89.534	putting carbon dioxide in their abdomen,
91.651	blowing them up like a balloon,
93.467	sticking one of these sharp pointy things into their abdomen --
98.656	it's dangerous stuff --
102.203	and taking instruments and watching it on a TV screen.
106.846	So let's see what it looks like.
108.813	So this is gallbladder surgery.
110.579	We perform a million of these a year
112.611	in the United States alone.
114.829	This is the real thing. There's no blood.
116.879	And you can see how focused the surgeons are,
120.013	how much concentration it takes.
122.528	You can see it in their faces.
124.212	It's hard to teach, and it's not all that easy to learn.
130.719	We do about five million of these in the United States
132.697	and maybe 20 million of these worldwide.
137.984	All right, you've all heard the term:
140.817	"""He's a born surgeon."""
142.615	Let me tell you, surgeons are not born.
146.015	Surgeons are not made either.
149.752	There are no little tanks where we're making surgeons.
153.092	Surgeons are trained one step at a time.
157.547	It starts with a foundation, basic skills.
161.399	We build on that and we take people, hopefully, to the operating room
166.164	where they learn to be an assistant.
167.932	Then we teach them to be a surgeon in training.
170.066	And when they do all of that for about five years,
172.998	they get the coveted board certification.
176.364	If you need surgery, you want to be operated on
178.998	by a board-certified surgeon.
181.482	You get your board certificate,
183.466	and you can go out into practice.
185.809	And eventually, if you're lucky, you achieve mastery.
190.076	Now that foundation is so important
194.108	that a number of us
196.009	from the largest general surgery society in the United States, SAGES,
199.576	started in the late 1990s a training program
202.442	that would assure that every surgeon who practices minimally invasive surgery
206.793	would have a strong foundation of knowledge and skills
211.375	necessary to go on and do procedures.
214.06	Now the science behind this is so potent
218.159	that it became required by the American Board of Surgery
221.943	in order for a young surgeon to become board certified.
225.493	It's not a lecture, it's not a course,
229.278	it's all of that plus a high-stakes assessment.
232.676	It's hard.
234.91	Now just this past year,
238.044	one of our partners, the American College of Surgeons,
241.11	teamed up with us to make an announcement
242.972	that all surgeons should be FLS (Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery)-certified
246.442	before they do minimally invasive surgery.
249.526	And are we talking about just people here in the U.S. and Canada?
252.97	No, we just said all surgeons.
254.943	So to lift this education and training worldwide
259.642	is a very large task,
260.892	something I'm very personally excited about as we travel around the world.
264.834	SAGES does surgery all over the world, teaching and educating surgeons.
269.526	So we have a problem, and one of the problems is distance.
273.565	We can't travel everywhere.
275.798	We need to make the world a smaller place.
278.616	And I think that we can develop some tools to do so.
281.299	And one of the tools I like personally is using video.
285.282	So I was inspired by a friend.
287.732	This is Allan Okrainec from Toronto.
289.981	And he proved
292.586	that you could actually teach people to do surgery
296.832	using video conferencing.
299.532	So here's Allan teaching an English-speaking surgeon in Africa
303.765	these basic fundamental skills
306.315	necessary to do minimally invasive surgery.
309.032	Very inspiring.
310.632	But for this examination, which is really hard,
314.398	we have a problem.
317.215	Even people who say they speak English,
319.815	only 14 percent pass.
322.332	Because for them it's not a surgery test,
324.348	it's an English test.
328.223	Let me bring it to you locally.
329.832	I work at the Cambridge Hospital.
331.499	It's the primary Harvard Medical School teaching facility.
334.782	We have more than 100 translators covering 63 languages,
340.098	and we spend millions of dollars just in our little hospital.
345.282	It's a big labor-intensive effort.
347.057	If you think about the worldwide burden
351.123	of trying to talk to your patients --
352.982	not just teaching surgeons, just trying to talk to your patients --
355.617	there aren't enough translators in the world.
358.765	We need to employ technology to assist us in this quest.
364.731	At our hospital we see everybody from Harvard professors
367.898	to people who just got here last week.
370.332	And you have no idea how hard it is
372.617	to talk to somebody or take care of somebody you can't talk to.
375.549	And there isn't always a translator available.
378.449	So we need tools.
382.812	We need a universal translator.
386.49	One of the things that I want to leave you with as you think about this talk
390.899	is that this talk is not just about us preaching to the world.
396.416	It's really about setting up a dialogue.
398.965	We have a lot to learn.
400.816	Here in the United States we spend more money per person
405.316	for outcomes that are not better than many countries in the world.
409.166	Maybe we have something to learn as well.
412.549	So I'm passionate about teaching these FLS skills all over the world.
417.032	This past year I've been in Latin America, I've been in China,
420.416	talking about the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery.
424.149	And everywhere I go the barrier is:
427.681	"""We want this, but we need it in our language."""
432.315	So here's what we think we want to do:
435.232	Imagine giving a lecture
437.649	and being able to talk to people in their own native language simultaneously.
442.645	I want to talk to the people in Asia, Latin America, Africa, Europe
448.333	seamlessly, accurately
453.053	and in a cost-effective fashion using technology.
457.334	And it has to be bi-directional.
458.962	They have to be able to teach us something as well.
461.749	It's a big task.
463.149	So we looked for a universal translator; I thought there would be one out there.
466.215	Your webpage has translation, your cellphone has translation,
470.166	but nothing that's good enough to teach surgery.
475.366	Because we need a lexicon. What is a lexicon?
477.832	A lexicon is a body of words that describes a domain.
481.931	I need to have a health care lexicon.
484.416	And in that I need a surgery lexicon.
488.017	That's a tall order. We have to work at it.
492.272	So let me show you what we're doing.
494.065	This is research -- can't buy it.
496.366	We're working with the folks at IBM Research from the Accessibility Center
500.849	to string together technologies to work towards the universal translator.
505.782	It starts with a framework system
507.916	where when the surgeon delivers the lecture
510.648	using a framework of captioning technology,
513.815	we then add another technology to do video conferencing.
518.231	But we don't have the words yet, so we add a third technology.
521.716	And now we've got the words,
524.366	and we can apply the special sauce: the translation.
528.917	We get the words up in a window and then apply the magic.
533.297	We work with a fourth technology.
535.581	And we currently have access to eleven language pairs.
539.565	More to come as we think about trying to make the world a smaller place.
544.066	And I'd like to show you our prototype
546.715	of stringing all of these technologies that don't necessarily always talk to each other
551.548	to become something useful.
555.215	Narrator: Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery.
559.011	Module five: manual skills practice.
562.624	Students may display captions in their native language.
569.907	Steven Schwaitzberg: If you're in Latin America,
571.656	"you click the ""I want it in Spanish"" button"
573.541	and out it comes in real time in Spanish.
577.173	But if you happen to be sitting in Beijing at the same time,
580.007	by using technology in a constructive fashion,
583.34	you could get it in Mandarin or you could get it in Russian --
586.606	on and on and on, simultaneously without the use of human translators.
592.072	But that's the lectures.
594.272	If you remember what I told you about FLS at the beginning,
597.123	it's knowledge and skills.
600.14	The difference in an operation
602.423	between doing something successfully and not
607.023	may be moving your hand this much.
610.49	So we're going to take it one step further;
612.79	we've brought my friend Allan back.
614.923	Allan Okrainec: Today we're going to practice suturing.
620.024	This is how you hold the needle.
622.022	Grab the needle at the tip.
627.519	It's important to be accurate.
629.977	Aim for the black dots.
633.81	Orient your loop this way.
637.259	Now go ahead and cut.
641.844	Very good Oscar. I'll see you next week.
645.732	SS: So that's what we're working on
648.598	in our quest for the universal translator.
651.581	We want it to be bi-directional.
653.665	We have a need to learn as well as to teach.
657.866	I can think of a million uses for a tool like this.
661.882	As we think about intersecting technologies --
664.632	everybody has a cell phone with a camera --
667.032	we could use this everywhere,
669.248	whether it be health care, patient care,
671.331	engineering, law, conferencing, translating videos.
675.816	This is a ubiquitous tool.
678.216	In order to break down our barriers,
680.415	we have to learn to talk to people,
682.182	to demand that people work on translation.
686.182	We need it for our everyday life,
688.532	in order to make the world a smaller place.
691.366	Thank you very much.
693.066	(Applause)
