15.871	I'm going to start
15.871	on a slightly somber note.
19.736	Two thousand and seven, five years ago,
22.707	my wife gets diagnosed with breast cancer.
26.41	Stage IIB.
29.372	Now, looking back, the most
29.372	harrowing part of that experience
32.379	was not just the hospital visits --
34.21	these were very painful
34.21	for my wife, understandably so.
37.451	It was not even the initial shock
37.451	of knowing that she had breast cancer
40.925	at just 39 years old,
42.1	absolutely no history
42.1	of cancer in her family.
45.463	The most horrifying and agonizing part
45.463	of the whole experience
49.684	was we were making decisions
49.684	after decisions after decisions
53.475	that were being thrust upon us.
55.436	Should it be a mastectomy?
55.436	Should it be a lumpectomy?
58.579	Should it be a more
58.579	aggressive form of treatment,
60.904	given that it was stage IIB?
62.774	With all the side effects?
64.073	Or should it be a less
64.073	aggressive form of treatment?
67.134	And these were being thrust
67.134	upon us by the doctors.
71.665	Now you could ask this question,
73.306	why were the doctors doing this?
74.868	A simplistic answer would be,
76.351	the doctors are doing this
77.632	because they want to protect
77.632	themselves legally.
81.153	I think that is too simplistic.
82.86	These are well-meaning doctors,
84.4	some of them have gone on
84.4	to become very good friends.
87.059	They probably were simply
87.059	following the wisdom
89.236	that has come down through the ages,
91.013	this adage that when
91.013	you're making decisions,
93.152	especially decisions of importance,
94.858	it's best to be in charge,
94.858	it's best to be in control,
97.425	it's best to be in the driver's seat.
100.375	And we were certainly
100.375	in the driver's seat,
102.501	making all these decisions.
103.835	And let me tell you --
103.835	if some of you have been there,
106.453	it was a most agonizing
106.453	and harrowing experience.
109.937	Which got me thinking.
111.115	I said, is there any validity
111.115	to this whole adage
114.424	that when you're making decisions,
116.512	it's best to take the driver's seat,
118.633	be in charge, be in control?
120.039	Or are there contexts
120.039	where we're far better off
123.851	taking the passenger's seat
125.357	and have someone else drive?
126.731	For example, a trusted financial advisor,
128.737	could be a trusted doctor, etc.
131.483	And since I study human decision making,
134.1	I said, I'm going to run some studies
136.577	to find some answers.
138.057	And I'm going to share one
138.057	of these studies with you today.
141.49	So, imagine that all of you
141.49	are participants in the study.
145.395	I want to tell you that
145.395	what you're going to do in the study is,
148.663	you're going to drink a cup of tea.
151.176	If you're wondering why, I'll tell you why
151.176	in a few seconds from now.
154.653	You are going to solve
154.653	a series of puzzles,
157.002	and I'm going to show you examples
157.002	of these puzzles momentarily.
161.462	And the more puzzles you solve,
162.984	the greater the chances
162.984	that you'll win some prizes.
166.427	Now, why do you have to consume the tea?
168.369	Why? Because it makes a lot of sense:
170.212	In order to solve these puzzles
170.212	effectively, if you think about it,
173.45	your mind needs to be in two states
173.45	simultaneously, right?
177.221	It needs to be alert,
179.392	for which caffeine is very good.
182.083	Simultaneously, it needs to be calm --
184.807	not agitated, calm --
186.554	for which chamomile is very good.
190.675	Now comes the between-subjects design,
193.456	the AB design, the AB testing.
195.291	So what I'm going to do is randomly
195.291	assign you to one of two groups.
199.012	So imagine that there is
199.012	an imaginary line out here,
201.633	so everyone here will be group A,
204.841	everyone out here will be group B.
207.687	Now, for you folks, what I'm going to do
207.687	is I'm going to show you these two teas,
212.399	and I'll go ahead and ask you
212.399	to choose your tea.
215.615	So you can choose whichever tea you want.
217.607	You can decide, what is your mental state:
219.781	OK, I choose the caffeinated tea,
221.417	I choose the chamomile tea.
222.732	So you're going to be in charge,
222.732	you're going to be in control,
225.742	you're going to be in the driver's seat.
228.128	You folks, I'm going to show you
228.128	these two teas,
231.305	but you don't have a choice.
233.401	I'm going to give you
233.401	one of these two teas,
235.484	and keep in mind, I'm going
235.484	to pick one of these two teas
238.206	at random for you.
239.625	And you know that.
241.475	So if you think about it,
241.475	this is an extreme-case scenario,
244.297	because in the real world,
245.607	whenever you are taking passenger's seat,
247.628	very often the driver is going
247.628	to be someone you trust,
250.248	an expert, etc.
251.495	So this is an extreme-case scenario.
254.319	Now, you're all going to consume the tea.
259.28	So imagine that you're taking the tea now,
261.343	we'll wait for you to finish the tea.
263.147	We'll give another five minutes
263.147	for the ingredient to have its effects.
267.027	Now you're going to have
272.588	Here's an example of the puzzle
272.588	you're going to solve.
275.905	Anyone in the audience
275.905	want to take a stab?
278.022	Audience member: Pulpit!
278.022	Baba Shiv: Whoa! OK.
280.207	That's cool.
281.381	Yeah, so what we'd do if we had
281.381	you who gave the answer
284.409	as a participant,
285.712	we would have calibrated
285.712	the difficulty level
287.894	of the puzzles to your expertise.
290.001	Because we want
290.001	these puzzles to be difficult.
292.35	These are tricky puzzles,
293.589	because your first instinct
293.589	"is to say ""tulip."""
296.7	And then you have to unstick yourself.
299.22	Right?
300.395	So these have been calibrated
300.395	to your level of expertise,
303.134	because we want this to be difficult,
305.015	and I'll tell you why, momentarily.
307.209	Now, here's another example.
309.789	Anyone? This is much more difficult.
311.55	Audience member: Embark.
311.55	BS: Yeah. Wow! OK.
313.59	So, yeah, so this is, again, difficult.
315.489	"You'll say ""kamber,"" then you'll go,"
315.489	"""maker,"" and all that,"
318.346	and then you can unstick yourself.
320	So you have 30 minutes now
320	to solve these 15 puzzles.
324.096	Now, the question we're asking
324.096	here is, in terms of the outcome --
328.181	and it comes in the number
328.181	of puzzles solved --
330.8	will you in the driver's seat
330.8	end up solving more puzzles
335.024	because you are in control,
336.351	you could decide which tea
336.351	you would choose,
338.533	or would you be better off,
340.064	in terms of the number of puzzles solved?
342.611	And, systemically, what we will show,
345.664	across a series of studies,
347.242	is that you, the passengers,
349.56	even though the tea
349.56	was picked for you at random,
353.133	will end up solving
353.133	more puzzles than you, the drivers.
357.385	We also observe another thing,
359.776	and that is, you folks not only
359.776	are solving fewer puzzles,
362.558	you're also putting less juice
362.558	into the task -- less effort,
366.399	you're less persistent, and so on.
368.089	How do we know that?
369.264	Well, we have two objective measures.
371.583	One is, what is the time,
371.583	on average, you're taking
374.755	in attempting to solve these puzzles?
377.226	You will spend less time compared to you.
380.031	Second, you have
382.071	are you taking the entire 30 minutes
383.833	or are you giving up
383.833	before the 30 minutes elapse?
386.246	You will be more likely to give up
386.246	before the 30 minutes elapse,
390.181	compared to you.
391.36	So you're putting in less juice,
393.016	and therefore, the outcome:
393.016	fewer puzzles solved.
396.991	That brings us now to:
396.991	why does this happen?
401.05	And under what situations -- when --
401.05	would we see this pattern of results
405.673	where the passenger is going to show
405.673	better, more favorable outcomes,
409.388	compared to the driver?
412.027	It all has to do with when you face
412.027	what I call the INCA.
417.618	It's an acronym that stands for the nature
417.618	of the feedback you're getting
421.545	after you made the decision.
423.491	So if you think about it,
423.491	in this particular puzzle task --
426.347	it could happen in investing
426.347	in the stock market,
428.695	very volatile out there,
429.873	it could be the medical situation --
431.699	the feedback here is immediate.
433.366	You know the feedback,
433.366	whether you're solving the puzzles or not.
436.671	Right? Second, it is negative.
439.306	Remember, the deck
439.306	was stacked against you,
441.898	in terms of the difficulty
441.898	level of these puzzles.
444.714	And this can happen in the medical domain.
446.752	For example, very early on
446.752	in the treatment,
448.878	things are negative, the feedback,
448.878	before things become positive.
451.966	Right? It can happen in the stock market.
454.012	Volatile stock market, getting negative
454.012	feedback, it is also immediate.
457.392	And the feedback in all these cases
457.392	is concrete, it's unambiguous;
461.064	you know if you've solved
461.064	the puzzles or not.
463.593	Now, the added one,
465.25	apart from this immediacy,
465.25	negative, this concreteness --
470.728	now you have a sense of agency.
474.264	You were responsible for your decision.
477.234	So what do you do?
478.71	You focus on the foregone option.
481.587	You say, you know what?
483.263	I should have chosen the other tea.
485.079	(Laughter)
488.682	That casts your decision in doubt,
491.464	reduces the confidence
491.464	you have in the decision,
493.79	the confidence you have
493.79	in the performance,
496.17	the performance in terms
496.17	of solving the puzzles.
498.465	And therefore less juice into the task,
500.543	fewer puzzles solved
502.32	and less favorable outcomes
502.32	compared to you folks.
505.572	And this can happen in the medical
505.572	domain, if you think about it, right?
509.019	A patient in the driver's
509.019	seat, for example.
511.162	Less juice, which means
511.162	keeping herself or himself
513.537	less physically fit, physically active
513.537	to hasten the recovery process,
517.085	which is what is often advocated.
518.704	You probably wouldn't do that.
520.916	And therefore, there are times
520.916	when you're facing the INCA,
526.84	when the feedback is going
526.84	to be immediate, negative, concrete
530.781	and you have the sense of agency,
532.401	where you're far better off
532.401	taking the passenger's seat
535.88	and have someone else drive.
538.864	Now, I started off on a somber note.
542.088	I want to finish up on a more upbeat note.
544.151	It has now been five years,
544.151	slightly more than five years,
547.285	and the good news, thank God,
547.285	is that the cancer is still in remission.
553.878	So it all ends well.
556.23	But one thing I didn't mention
556.23	was that very early on into her treatment,
562.419	my wife and I decided
562.419	that we would take the passenger's seat.
566.331	And that made so much of a difference
568.35	in terms of the peace of mind
568.35	that came with that;
571.149	we could focus on her recovery.
573.035	We let the doctors make all the decisions
575.99	and take the driver's seat.
578.196	Thank you.
579.372	(Applause)
