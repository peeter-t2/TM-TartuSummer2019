12.794	About 10 years ago, I went through
12.794	a little bit of a hard time.
16.175	So I decided to go see a therapist.
18.473	I had been seeing her for a few months,
18.473	when she looked at me one day and said,
22.219	"""Who actually raised you"
22.219	"until you were three?"""
26.202	Seemed like a weird question.
26.202	"I said, ""My parents."""
29.89	"And she said, ""I don't think"
29.89	that's actually the case;
33.172	because if it were,
34.353	we'd be dealing with things that are
34.353	"far more complicated than just this."""
38.906	It sounded like the setup to a joke,
38.906	but I knew she was serious.
42.948	Because when I first started seeing her,
45.224	I was trying to be
45.224	the funniest person in the room.
47.854	And I would try and crack these jokes,
47.854	but she caught on to me really quickly,
52.036	and whenever I tried to make a joke,
52.036	she would look at me and say,
55.837	"""That is actually really sad."""
58.991	(Laughter)
60.912	It's terrible.
62.557	So I knew I had to be serious,
62.557	and I asked my parents
66.068	who had actually raised me
66.068	until I was three?
68.666	And to my surprise, they said
71.064	my primary caregiver had been
71.064	a distant relative of the family.
75.291	I had called her my auntie.
78.502	I remember my auntie so clearly,
80.611	it felt like she had been part of my life
80.611	when I was much older.
84.312	I remember the thick, straight hair,
86.663	and how it would come around
86.663	me like a curtain
88.949	when she bent to pick me up;
90.314	her soft, southern Thai accent;
92.876	the way I would cling to her,
94.73	even if she just wanted to go
94.73	to the bathroom
96.873	or get something to eat.
98.922	I loved her, but [with] the ferocity
98.922	that a child has sometimes
102.552	before she understands that love
102.552	also requires letting go.
108.807	But my clearest and sharpest
108.807	memory of my auntie,
112.267	is also one of my first
112.267	memories of life at all.
116.345	I remember her being beaten and slapped
116.345	by another member of my family.
121.686	I remember screaming hysterically
121.686	and wanting it to stop,
124.607	as I did every single time it happened,
127.405	for things as minor as wanting
127.405	to go out with her friends,
130.166	or being a little late.
132.856	I became so hysterical over her treatment,
135.292	that eventually, she was just
135.292	beaten behind closed doors.
141.634	Things got so bad for her
141.634	that eventually she ran away.
145.424	As an adult, I learned later
147.02	that she had been just 19
147.02	when she was brought over from Thailand
151.271	to the States to care for me,
151.271	on a tourist visa.
155.674	She wound up working
155.674	in Illinois for a time,
157.755	before eventually returning to Thailand,
160.209	which is where I ran into her again,
160.209	at a political rally in Bangkok.
165.159	I clung to her again, as I had
165.159	when I was a child,
168.616	and I let go, and then
168.616	I promised that I would call.
173.079	I never did, though.
175.536	Because I was afraid if I said
175.536	everything that she meant to me --
180.327	that I owed perhaps the best parts
180.327	of who I became to her care,
185.101	"and that the words ""I'm sorry"""
185.101	were like a thimble
188.213	to bail out all the guilt
188.213	and shame and rage I felt
192.662	over everything she had endured
192.662	to care for me for as long as she had --
198.41	I thought if I said those words to her,
198.41	I would never stop crying again.
204.304	Because she had saved me.
206.87	And I had not saved her.
212.877	I'm a journalist, and I've been writing
212.877	and researching human trafficking
216.345	for the past eight years or so,
218.47	and even so, I never put together
218.47	this personal story
222.445	with my professional life
222.445	until pretty recently.
226.234	I think this profound disconnect
226.234	actually symbolizes
229.577	most of our understanding
229.577	about human trafficking.
232.977	Because human trafficking is far more
232.977	prevalent, complex and close to home
238.628	than most of us realize.
241.377	I spent time in jails and brothels,
243.393	interviewed hundreds of survivors
243.393	and law enforcement, NGO workers.
247.578	And when I think about what we've done
247.578	about human trafficking,
250.579	I am hugely disappointed.
253.284	Partly because we don't even talk
253.284	about the problem right at all.
258.185	"When I say ""human trafficking,"""
260.011	most of you probably don't think
260.011	about someone like my auntie.
263.834	You probably think
263.834	about a young girl or woman,
266.575	who's been brutally forced
266.575	into prostitution by a violent pimp.
271.009	That is real suffering,
271.009	and that is a real story.
275.578	That story makes me angry
276.885	for far more than just the reality
276.885	of that situation, though.
281.56	As a journalist, I really care about how
281.56	we relate to each other through language,
286.396	and the way we tell that story,
286.396	with all the gory, violent detail,
290.111	the salacious aspects -- I call that
290.111	"""look at her scars"" journalism."
295.782	We use that story to convince ourselves
298.064	that human trafficking is a bad man
298.064	doing a bad thing to an innocent girl.
303.328	That story lets us off the hook.
305.248	It takes away all the societal context
305.248	that we might be indicted for,
309.01	for the structural inequality,
309.01	or the poverty,
311.193	or the barriers to migration.
313.689	We let ourselves think
314.864	that human trafficking is only
314.864	about forced prostitution,
318.464	when in reality,
320.003	human trafficking is embedded
320.003	in our everyday lives.
324.771	Let me show you what I mean.
326.996	Forced prostitution accounts for
331.828	Ten percent is in state-
331.828	imposed forced labor.
335.823	but a whopping 68 percent
335.823	is for the purpose of creating the goods
340.01	and delivering the services
340.01	that most of us rely on every day,
344.664	in sectors like agricultural work,
344.664	domestic work and construction.
349.298	That is food and care and shelter.
353.067	And somehow, these most essential workers
355.453	are also among the world's most underpaid
355.453	and exploited today.
361.43	Human trafficking is the use
361.43	of force, fraud or coercion
365.917	to compel another person's labor.
368.47	And it's found in cotton fields,
368.47	and coltan mines,
371.268	and even car washes in Norway and England.
374.245	It's found in U.S. military
374.245	bases in Iraq and Afghanistan.
378.171	It's found in Thailand's fishing industry.
380.726	That country has become the largest
380.726	exporter of shrimp in the world.
385.248	But what are the circumstances
387.598	behind all that cheap
387.598	and plentiful shrimp?
391.724	Thai military were caught selling
391.724	Burmese and Cambodian migrants
395.989	onto fishing boats.
397.944	Those fishing boats were taken out,
397.944	the men put to work,
401.065	and they were thrown overboard
401.065	if they made the mistake of falling sick,
404.741	or trying to resist their treatment.
407.368	Those fish were then used to feed shrimp,
409.887	The shrimp were then sold
409.887	to four major global retailers:
414.345	Costco, Tesco, Walmart and Carrefour.
421.251	Human trafficking is found
421.251	on a smaller scale than just that,
424.474	and in places you would
424.474	never even imagine.
427.016	Traffickers have forced young people
427.016	to drive ice cream trucks,
430.025	or to sing in touring boys' choirs.
432.953	Trafficking has even been found
432.953	in a hair braiding salon in New Jersey.
436.942	The scheme in that case was incredible.
439.522	The traffickers found young families
439.522	who were from Ghana and Togo,
445.647	and they told these families that
445.647	"""your daughters are going to get"
449.013	"a fine education in the United States."""
451.718	They then located winners
451.718	of the green card lottery,
454.4	"and they told them, ""We'll help you out."
457.285	We'll get you a plane ticket.
457.285	We'll pay your fees.
460.288	All you have to do is take
460.288	this young girl with you,
463.284	say that she's your sister or your spouse.
466.998	Once everyone arrived in New Jersey,
466.998	the young girls were taken away,
470.285	and put to work for 14-hour days,
472.868	seven days a week, for five years.
476.154	They made their traffickers
476.154	nearly four million dollars.
482.345	This is a huge problem.
484.491	So what have we done about it?
487.049	We've mostly turned
487.049	to the criminal justice system.
490.386	But keep in mind, most victims of human
490.386	trafficking are poor and marginalized.
494.418	They're migrants, people of color.
496.448	Sometimes they're in the sex trade.
498.634	And for populations like these,
500.824	the criminal justice system is
500.824	too often part of the problem,
503.886	rather than the solution.
506.444	In study after study, in countries ranging
506.444	from Bangladesh to the United States,
511.113	between 20 and 60 percent of the people
511.113	in the sex trade who were surveyed
515.874	said that they had been raped or assaulted
515.874	by the police in the past year alone.
522.302	People in prostitution, including people
522.302	who have been trafficked into it,
525.993	regularly receive multiple
525.993	convictions for prostitution.
529.809	Having that criminal record makes it
529.809	so much more difficult
532.897	to leave poverty, leave abuse,
532.897	or leave prostitution,
536.818	if that person so desires.
540.296	Workers outside of the sex sector --
542.256	if they try and resist their treatment,
542.256	they risk deportation.
547.146	In case after case I've studied,
547.146	employers have no problem
550.352	calling on law enforcement
550.352	to try and threaten or deport
553.819	their striking trafficked workers.
556.718	If those workers run away,
558.496	they risk becoming part of the great mass
558.496	of undocumented workers
563.232	who are also subject to the whims
563.232	of law enforcement if they're caught.
569.67	Law enforcement is supposed to identify
569.67	victims and prosecute traffickers.
576.033	But out of an estimated 21 million victims
576.033	of human trafficking in the world,
580.743	they have helped and identified
580.743	fewer than 50,000 people.
585.742	That's like comparing
587.385	the population of the world
587.385	to the population of Los Angeles,
591.28	proportionally speaking.
593.997	As for convictions, out of an estimated
593.997	5,700 convictions in 2013,
600.443	fewer than 500 were for labor trafficking.
603.976	Keep in mind that labor trafficking
605.692	accounts for 68 percent
605.692	of all trafficking,
608.882	but fewer than 10 percent
608.882	of the convictions.
614.161	I've heard one expert say that trafficking
614.161	happens where need meets greed.
619.523	I'd like to add one more element to that.
622.772	Trafficking happens in sectors where
622.772	workers are excluded from protections,
626.951	and denied the right to organize.
629.874	Trafficking doesn't happen in a vacuum.
632.538	It happens in systematically
632.538	degraded work environments.
637.249	You might be thinking,
638.424	oh, she's talking about failed states,
638.424	or war-torn states, or --
641.549	I'm actually talking
641.549	about the United States.
644.27	Let me tell you what that looks like.
647.342	I spent many months researching
647.342	a trafficking case called Global Horizons,
650.859	involving hundreds of Thai farm workers.
653.209	They were sent all over the States,
653.209	to work in Hawaii pineapple plantations,
656.825	and Washington apple orchards,
656.825	and anywhere the work was needed.
660.555	They were promised three years
660.555	of solid agricultural work.
664.903	So they made a calculated risk.
666.847	They sold their land, they sold
666.847	their wives' jewelry,
669.953	to make thousands in recruitment fees
669.953	for this company, Global Horizons.
674.776	But once they were brought over,
676.628	their passports were confiscated.
678.677	Some of the men were beaten
678.677	and held at gunpoint.
681.791	They worked so hard
681.791	they fainted in the fields.
686.138	This case hit me so hard.
689.572	After I came back home,
691.677	I was wandering through the grocery store,
691.677	and I froze in the produce department.
696.688	I was remembering the over-the-top meals
696.688	the Global Horizons survivors
700.108	would make for me every time
700.108	I showed up to interview them.
704.521	They finished one meal with this plate
704.521	of perfect, long-stemmed strawberries,
709.447	and as they handed them to me, they said,
711.984	"""Aren't these the kind of strawberries"
711.984	you eat with somebody special
715.24	in the States?
717.091	And don't they taste so much better
718.925	when you know the people
718.925	"whose hands picked them for you?"""
726.016	As I stood in that grocery store weeks
726.016	later, I realized I had no idea
730.271	of who to thank for this plenty,
732.471	and no idea of how
732.471	they were being treated.
735.569	So, like the journalist I am, I started
735.569	digging into the agricultural sector.
740.423	And I found there are too many fields,
740.423	and too few labor inspectors.
745.119	I found multiple layers
745.119	of plausible deniability
747.993	between grower and distributor
747.993	and processor, and God knows who else.
752.988	The Global Horizons survivors had been
752.988	brought to the States
755.878	on a temporary guest worker program.
758.979	That guest worker program
758.979	ties a person's legal status
762.636	to his or her employer,
764.302	and denies that worker
764.302	the right to organize.
768.717	Mind you, none of what I am describing
768.717	about this agricultural sector
772.993	or the guest worker program
772.993	is actually human trafficking.
777.234	It is merely what we find
777.234	legally tolerable.
782.305	And I would argue this is
782.305	fertile ground for exploitation.
786.187	And all of this had been hidden to me,
786.187	before I had tried to understand it.
791.741	I wasn't the only person
791.741	grappling with these issues.
795.045	Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay,
797.233	is one of the biggest anti-trafficking
797.233	philanthropists in the world.
801.544	And even he wound up accidentally
801.544	investing nearly 10 million dollars
806.709	in the pineapple plantation cited
806.709	as having the worst working conditions
810.393	in that Global Horizons case.
814.464	When he found out, he and his wife
814.464	were shocked and horrified,
818.458	and they wound up writing
818.458	an op-ed for a newspaper,
821.075	saying that it was up to all of us
821.075	to learn everything we can
824.998	about the labor and supply chains
824.998	of the products that we support.
829.909	I totally agree.
833.16	What would happen
833.16	if each one of us decided
835.797	that we are no longer going
835.797	to support companies
838.378	if they don't eliminate exploitation
838.378	from their labor and supply chains?
842.326	If we demanded laws calling for the same?
845.729	If all the CEOs out there decided
848.651	that they were going to go through
848.651	"their businesses and say, ""no more""?"
853.046	If we ended recruitment fees
853.046	for migrant workers?
856.574	If we decided that guest workers
856.574	should have the right to organize
859.709	without fear of retaliation?
861.968	These would be decisions heard
861.968	around the world.
866.729	This isn't a matter of buying
866.729	a fair-trade peach
869.007	and calling it a day, buying
869.007	a guilt-free zone with your money.
873.188	That's not how it works.
875.402	This is the decision to change
875.402	a system that is broken,
879.452	and that we have unwittingly but willingly
882.987	allowed ourselves to profit from
882.987	and benefit from for too long.
889.435	We often dwell on human trafficking
889.435	survivors' victimization.
894.303	But that is not my experience of them.
897.725	Over all the years that I've
897.725	been talking to them,
900.106	they have taught me that we are
900.106	more than our worst days.
903.941	Each one of us is more
903.941	than what we have lived through.
908.183	Especially trafficking survivors.
910.746	These people were the most resourceful
910.746	and resilient and responsible
914.393	in their communities.
916.022	They were the people that you
916.022	would take a gamble on.
919.084	You'd say, I'm gong to sell my rings,
919.084	because I have the chance
922.29	to send you off to a better future.
925.39	They were the emissaries of hope.
929.371	These survivors don't need saving.
932.731	They need solidarity,
932.731	because they're behind
935.799	some of the most exciting
935.799	social justice movements out there today.
940.766	The nannies and housekeepers
940.766	who marched with their families
943.727	and their employers' families --
945.651	their activism got us
945.651	an international treaty
948.593	on domestic workers' rights.
951.284	The Nepali women who were trafficked
951.284	into the sex trade --
955.303	they came together, and they decided
957.074	that they were going to make the world's
957.074	first anti-trafficking organization
960.695	actually headed and run
960.695	by trafficking survivors themselves.
965.681	These Indian shipyard workers
965.681	were trafficked
968.483	to do post-Hurricane Katrina
968.483	reconstruction.
971.541	They were threatened with deportation,
971.541	but they broke out of their work compound
975.339	and they marched from New Orleans
975.339	to Washington, D.C.,
978.742	to protest labor exploitation.
981.778	They cofounded an organization called
981.778	the National Guest Worker Alliance,
985.317	and through this organization,
985.317	they have wound up helping other workers
990.025	bring to light exploitation
990.025	and abuses in supply chains
994.447	in Walmart and Hershey's factories.
996.139	And although the Department
996.139	of Justice declined to take their case,
1000.344	a team of civil rights lawyers won
1000.344	the first of a dozen civil suits
1004.61	this February, and got
1004.61	their clients 14 million dollars.
1010.26	These survivors are fighting
1010.26	for people they don't even know yet,
1014.541	other workers, and for the possibility
1014.541	of a just world for all of us.
1019.626	This is our chance to do the same.
1022.716	This is our chance to make the decision
1024.923	that tells us who we are,
1024.923	as a people and as a society;
1028.778	that our prosperity is no
1028.778	longer prosperity,
1031.649	as long as it is pinned
1031.649	to other people's pain;
1035.561	that our lives are
1035.561	inextricably woven together;
1039.193	and that we have the power
1039.193	to make a different choice.
1046.217	I was so reluctant to share
1046.217	my story of my auntie with you.
1051.976	Before I started this TED process
1051.976	and climbed up on this stage,
1054.977	I had told literally a handful
1054.977	of people about it,
1057.977	because, like many a journalist,
1059.953	I am far more interested in learning
1059.953	about your stories
1062.867	than sharing much,
1062.867	if anything, about my own.
1067.273	I also haven't done my journalistic
1067.273	due diligence on this.
1070.242	I haven't issued my mountains
1070.242	of document requests,
1072.67	and interviewed everyone and their mother,
1074.931	and I haven't found my auntie yet.
1077.241	I don't know her story
1077.241	of what happened, and of her life now.
1082.781	The story as I've told it to you
1082.781	is messy and unfinished.
1086.914	But I think it mirrors the messy
1086.914	and unfinished situation we're all in,
1091.79	when it comes to human trafficking.
1094.523	We are all implicated in this problem.
1098.291	But that means we are all
1098.291	also part of its solution.
1104.241	Figuring out how to build a more
1104.241	just world is our work to do,
1108.379	and our story to tell.
1111.289	So let us tell it the way
1111.289	we should have done,
1113.701	from the very beginning.
1115.801	Let us tell this story together.
1119.518	Thank you so much.
