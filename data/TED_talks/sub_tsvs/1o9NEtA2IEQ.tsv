12.804	All right, let's get up
12.804	our picture of the earth.
16.38	The earth is pretty awesome.
17.82	I'm a geologist, so I get
17.82	pretty psyched about this,
20.273	but the earth is great.
21.66	It's powerful, it's dynamic,
21.66	it's constantly changing.
25.14	It's a pretty exciting place to live.
28.1	But I want to share with you guys today
28.1	my perspective as a geologist
31.82	in how understanding earth's past
34.06	can help inform and guide
34.06	decisions that we make today
37.58	about how to sustainably live
37.58	on earth's surface.
41.34	So there's a lot of exciting things
41.34	that go on on the surface of the earth.
45.1	If we zoom in here a little bit,
47.18	I want to talk to you guys a little bit
47.18	about one of the things that happens.
50.86	Material get shuffled around
50.86	earth's surface all the time,
53.62	and one of the big thing that happens
53.62	is material from high mountains
56.88	gets eroded and transported
56.88	and deposited in the sea.
59.38	And this process is ongoing all the time,
61.37	and it has huge effects
61.37	on how the landscape works.
63.78	So this example here in south India --
65.7	we have some of the biggest
65.7	mountains in the world,
68.22	and you can see in this satellite photo
70.22	rivers transporting material
70.22	from those mountains out to the sea.
74.42	You can think of these rivers
74.42	like bulldozers.
76.62	They're basically taking these mountains
76.62	and pushing them down towards the sea.
81.26	We'll give you guys an example here.
83.1	So we zoom in a little bit.
84.46	I want to talk to you guys
84.46	specifically about a river.
87.02	We can see these beautiful patterns
87.02	that the rivers make
89.7	as they're pushing material
89.7	down to the sea,
91.82	but these patterns aren't static.
93.46	These rivers are wiggling
93.46	and jumping around quite a bit,
96.17	and it can have big impacts on our lives.
98.16	So an example of this
98.16	is this is the Kosi River.
100.58	So the Kosi River
100.58	has this nice c-shaped pathway,
103.26	and it exits the big mountains of Nepal
105.74	carrying with it a ton of material,
107.9	a lot of sediments that's being
107.9	eroded from the high mountains,
110.89	and it spreads out across India
112.77	and moves this material.
114.38	So we're going to zoom in to this area
116.7	and I'm going to tell you a little bit
116.7	about what happened with the Kosi.
120.153	It's an example of how dynamic
120.153	these systems can be.
122.74	So this is a satellite image
122.74	from August of 2008,
126.34	and this satellite image is colored
128.06	so that vegetations or plants
128.06	show up as green
130.26	and water shows up as blue.
131.94	So here again you can see
131.94	that c-shaped pathway
135.5	that this river takes as it exits Nepal.
137.94	And now this is monsoon season.
139.98	August is monsoon season
139.98	in this region of the world,
142.5	and anyone that lives near a river
142.5	is no stranger to flooding
145.42	and the hazards and inconveniences
145.42	at minimum that are associated with that.
149.26	But something interesting
149.26	happened in 2008,
151.54	and this river moved in a way
151.54	that's very different.
154.46	It flooded in a way that's very
154.46	different than it normally does.
157.484	So the Kosi River is flowing down here,
160.26	but sometimes as these rivers
160.26	are bulldozing sediment,
162.86	they kind of get clogged,
164.14	and these clogs can
164.14	actually cause the rivers
166.3	to shift their course dramatically.
168.02	So this satellite image
168.02	is from just two weeks later.
170.9	Here's the previous pathway,
172.86	that c-shaped pathway,
174.5	and you notice it's not blue anymore.
176.62	But now what we have is this blue pathway
178.62	that cuts down the middle
178.62	of the field of view here.
181.1	What happened is
181.1	the Kosi River jumped its banks,
183.46	and for reference,
183.46	the scale bar here is 40 miles.
186.18	This river moved
186.18	over 30 miles very abruptly.
190.38	So this river got clogged
190.38	and it jumped its banks.
193.58	Here's an image from about a week later,
195.7	and you can see
195.7	these are the previous pathways,
197.98	and you can see this process
197.98	of river-jumping continues
200.66	as this river moves farther away
200.66	from its major course.
203.74	So you can imagine
203.74	in landscapes like this,
205.82	where rivers move around frequently,
208.46	it's really important to understand when,
208.46	where and how they're going to jump.
212.98	But these kinds of processes
212.98	also happen a lot closer to home as well.
217.46	So in the United States,
219.3	we have the Mississippi River
219.3	that drains most of the continental US.
223.38	It pushes material
223.38	from the Rocky Mountains
225.78	and from the Great Plains.
227.34	It drains it and moves it
227.34	all the way across America
230.58	and dumps it out in the Gulf of Mexico.
233.14	So this is the course of the Mississippi
233.14	that we're familiar with today,
236.62	but it didn't always flow
236.62	in this direction.
238.74	If we use the geologic record,
240.42	we can reconstruct
240.42	where it went in the past.
243.94	So for example, this red area here
246.26	is where we know the Mississippi River
246.26	flowed and deposited material
249.82	about 4,600 years ago.
252.06	Then about 3,500 years ago it moved
254.18	to follow the course
254.18	outlined here in orange.
256.58	And it kept moving and it keeps moving.
258.62	So here's about 2,000 years ago,
260.54	a thousand years ago,
263.5	And it was only
263.5	as recently as 500 years ago
265.94	that it occupied the pathway
265.94	that we're familiar with today.
269.899	So these processes are really important,
271.86	and especially here, this delta area,
274.74	where these river-jumping events
274.74	in the Mississippi
278.58	are building land at the interface
278.58	of the land and the sea.
281.42	This is really valuable real estate,
283.18	and deltas like this are some of the most
283.18	densely populated areas on our planet.
288.46	So understanding the dynamics
288.46	of these landscapes,
290.94	how they formed and how they will
290.94	continue to change in the future
294.1	is really important
294.1	for the people that live there.
297.3	So rivers also wiggle.
298.86	These are sort of bigger jumps
298.86	that we've been talking about.
301.78	I want to show you guys
301.78	some river wiggles here.
304.06	So we're going to fly down
304.06	to the Amazon River basin,
306.62	and here again we have a big river system
308.66	that is draining and moving and plowing
308.66	material from the Andean Mountains,
313.06	transporting it across South America
314.9	and dumping it out
314.9	into the Atlantic Ocean.
318.38	So if we zoom in here, you guys
318.38	can see these nice, curvy river pathways.
323.1	Again, they're really beautiful,
323.1	but again, they're not static.
326.1	These rivers wiggle around.
327.86	We can use satellite imagery
327.86	over the last 30 or so years
331.5	to actually monitor how these change.
333.66	So take a minute and just watch
333.66	any bend or curve in this river,
337.86	and you'll see it doesn't stay
337.86	in the same place for very long.
340.86	It changes and evolves
340.86	and warps its pattern.
344.66	If you look in this area in particular,
347.06	I want you guys to notice
347.06	there's a sort of a loop in the river
350.06	that gets completely cut off.
351.5	It's almost like a whip cracking
353.1	and snaps off the pathway
353.1	of the river at a certain spot.
356.18	So just for reference, again,
357.82	in this location, that river
357.82	changed its course over four miles
362.78	over the course of a season or two.
364.9	So the landscapes
364.9	that we live in on earth,
367.82	as this material
367.82	is being eroded from the mountains
370.26	and transported to the sea,
371.62	are wiggling around all the time.
373.26	They're changing all the time,
374.74	and we need to be able
374.74	to understand these processes
377.22	so we can manage and live
377.22	sustainably on these landscapes.
379.98	But it's hard to do
379.98	if the only information we have
383.06	is what's going on today
383.06	at earth's surface.
385.42	Right? We don't have
385.42	a lot of observations.
387.5	We only have 30 years' worth
387.5	of satellite photos, for example.
392.34	We need more observations
392.34	to understand these processes more.
395.26	And additionally, we need to know
396.9	how these landscapes are going
396.9	to respond to changing climate
400.14	and to changing land use
401.42	as we continue to occupy
401.42	and modify earth's surface.
404.98	So this is where the rocks come in.
407.54	So as rivers flow,
410.06	as they're bulldozing material
410.06	from the mountains to the sea,
412.98	sometimes bits of sand and clay
412.98	and rock get stuck in the ground.
416.46	And that stuff that gets stuck
416.46	in the ground gets buried,
419.18	and through time, we get
419.18	big, thick accumulations of sediments
422.94	that eventually turn into rocks.
424.98	What this means is that we can
424.98	go to places like this,
427.58	where we see big, thick stacks
427.58	of sedimentary rocks,
430.3	and go back in time
431.82	and see what the landscapes
431.82	looked like in the past.
434.58	We can do this to help reconstruct
436.74	and understand
436.74	how earth landscapes evolve.
441.98	This is pretty convenient, too,
443.62	because the earth has had
443.62	sort of an epic history. Right?
446.62	So this video here
446.62	is a reconstruction of paleogeography
451.46	for just the first
455.1	So just a little bit of time here.
457.1	So as the plates move around,
459.86	we know climate has changed,
459.86	sea level has changed,
463.02	we have a lot of different
463.02	types of landscapes
466.7	and different types of environments
466.7	that we can go back --
469.46	if we have a time machine --
470.86	we can go back and look at,
472.22	and we do indeed have a time machine
473.98	because we can look at the rocks
473.98	that were deposited at these times.
477.34	So I'm going to give you
477.34	an example of this
479.38	and take you to a special
479.38	time in earth's past.
481.62	About 55 million years ago,
481.62	there was a really abrupt warming event,
484.86	and what happened was
484.86	a whole bunch of carbon dioxide
487.38	was released into earth's atmosphere,
489.22	and it caused a rapid
489.22	and pretty extreme global warming event.
493.1	And when I say warm, I mean pretty warm,
495.78	that there were things
495.78	like crocodiles and palm trees
498.78	as far north as Canada
498.78	and as far south as Patagonia.
501.82	So this was a pretty warm time
501.82	and it happened really abruptly.
505.02	So what we can do
506.26	is we can go back and find rocks
506.26	that were deposited at this time
509.34	and reconstruct how the landscape changed
509.34	in response to this warming event.
513.38	So here, yay, rocks.
515.3	(Laughter)
517.66	Here's a pile of rocks.
519.42	This yellow blob here,
521.06	this is actually a fossil river,
522.82	so just like this cartoon I showed,
524.511	these are deposits that were
524.511	laid down 55 million years ago.
527.82	As geologists, we can go
527.82	and look at these up close
530.94	and reconstruct the landscape.
533.06	So here's another example.
534.58	The yellow blob here is a fossil river.
537.06	Here's another one above it.
538.62	We can go and look in detail
538.62	and make measurements and observations,
541.94	and we can measure features.
543.34	For example, the features
543.34	I just highlighted there
545.74	tell us that this particular river
545.74	was probably about three feet deep.
549.22	You could wade
549.22	across this cute little stream
551.34	if you were walking around
554.3	The reddish stuff that's above
554.3	and below those channels,
557.22	those are ancient soil deposits.
559.02	So we can look at those to tell us
559.02	what lived and grew on the landscape
562.9	and to understand how these rivers
562.9	were interacting with their floodplains.
567.5	So we can look in detail
567.5	and reconstruct with some specificity
571.9	how these rivers flowed
571.9	and what the landscapes looked like.
574.78	So when we do this
574.78	for this particular place
577.98	at this time,
579.22	if we look what happened
579.22	before this abrupt warming event,
581.98	the rivers kind of carved their way
581.98	down from the mountains to the sea,
585.62	and they looked maybe similar to what
585.62	I showed you in the Amazon River basin.
590.78	But right at the onset
590.78	of this climate change event,
593.26	the rivers change dramatically.
595.3	All of a sudden they got much broader,
597.18	and they started to slide back and forth
597.18	across the landscape more readily.
601.7	Eventually, the rivers reverted
601.7	back to a state that was more similar
605.62	to what they would have looked like
605.62	before this climate event,
609.46	but it took a long, long time.
612.06	So we can go back in earth's time
612.06	and do these kinds of reconstructions
615.94	and understand how
615.94	earth's landscape has changed
618.58	in response to a climate event like this
618.58	or a land use event.
622.38	So some of the ways that rivers change
624.5	or the reasons that rivers change
624.5	their pattern and their movements
629.3	is because of things like with extra water
629.3	falling on the land's surface
633.26	when climate is hotter,
635.22	we can move more sediment
635.22	and erode more sediment,
637.78	and that changes how rivers behave.
640.5	So ultimately,
642.62	as long as earth's surface is our home,
645.26	we need to carefully manage
645.26	the resources and risks
648.66	associated with living
648.66	in dynamic environments.
651.66	And I think the only way
651.66	we can really do that sustainably
655.62	is if we include information
657.86	about how landscapes evolved
657.86	and behaved in earth's past.
661.98	Thank you.
663.22	(Applause)
