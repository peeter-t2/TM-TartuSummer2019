16.26	I'm going to show you how terrorism
18.26	actually interacts with our daily life.
25.26	At the time he was looking after the rights of political prisoners
28.26	in Italian jails.
31.26	He asked me if I wanted to interview the Red Brigades.
35.26	Now, as many of you may remember,
37.26	the Red Brigades was a terrorist, Marxist organization
41.26	which was very active in Italy
43.26	from the 1960s until the mid-1980s.
47.26	As part of their strategy
49.26	the Red Brigades never spoke with anybody, not even with their lawyers.
53.26	They sat in silence through their trails,
57.26	waving occasionally at family and friends.
61.26	In 1993 they declared the end of the armed struggle.
67.26	And they drew a list of people with whom they would talk,
69.26	and tell their story.
71.26	And I was one of those people.
74.26	When I asked my friend why the Red Brigades want to talk to me,
77.26	he said that the female members of the organization
81.26	had actually supported my name.
84.26	In particular, one person had put it forward.
87.26	She was my childhood friend.
90.26	She had joined the Red Brigades
92.26	and became a leader of the organization.
95.26	Naturally, I didn't know that
97.26	until the day she was arrested.
99.26	In fact, I read it in the newspaper.
103.26	At the time of the phone call
105.26	I just had a baby,
107.26	I successfully completed a management buyout
109.26	to the company I was working with,
112.26	and the last thing I wanted to do was to go back home
115.26	and touring the high-security prisons.
118.26	But this is exactly what I did
121.26	because I wanted to know
123.26	what had turned my best friend
125.26	into a terrorist,
127.26	and why she'd never tried to recruit me.
131.26	(Laughter)
133.26	(Applause)
136.26	So, this is exactly what I did.
141.26	Now, I found the answer very quickly.
145.26	I actually had failed
147.26	the psychological profiling of a terrorist.
150.26	The center committee of the Red Brigades
152.26	had judged me too single-minded
154.26	and too opinionated to become a good terrorist.
158.26	My friend, on the other hand, she was a good terrorist
161.26	because she was very good at following orders.
164.26	She also embraced violence.
167.26	Because she believed that the only way
169.26	to unblock what, at the time,
172.26	was known as a blocked democracy,
174.26	Italy, a country run by the same party for 35 years
178.26	was the arms struggle.
182.26	At the same time, while I was interviewing the Red Brigades,
185.26	I also discovered that their life was not ruled
188.26	by politics or ideology,
191.26	but actually was ruled by economics.
194.26	They were constantly short of cash.
197.26	They were constantly searching for cash.
200.26	Now, contrary to what many people believe,
202.26	terrorism is actually a very expensive business.
206.26	I'll give you an idea.
208.26	In the 1970s, the turnover of the Red Brigades
213.26	on a yearly basis
215.26	was seven million dollars.
217.26	This is roughly between 100
219.26	and 150 million, today.
221.26	Now, you know, if you live underground
224.26	it's really hard to produce this amount of money.
229.26	But this also explains why, when I was interviewing the Red Brigades,
233.26	and then, later on, other arms organizations,
236.26	including members of al-Zarqawi group in the Middle East,
241.26	everybody was extremely reluctant
244.26	to talk about ideology, or politics.
247.26	Because they had no idea.
249.26	The political vision of a terrorist organization
253.26	is decided by the leadership,
256.26	which, generally, is never more than five to seven people.
259.26	All the others do, day in and day out,
262.26	is search for money.
264.26	Once, for example, I was interviewing
266.26	this part-timer from the Red Brigades.
269.26	It was a psychiatrist. He loved sailing.
271.26	He was a really keen sailor. And he had this beautiful boat.
275.26	And he told me that the best time of his life
277.26	was when he was a member of the Red Brigades
280.26	and he went sailing, every summer, back and forth
282.26	from Lebanon, where he would pick up
284.26	Soviet weapons from the PLO,
286.26	and then carry them all the way to Sardinia
289.26	where the other arms organization from Europe would go
292.26	and take their share of the arms.
295.26	For that service the Red Brigades were actually paid a fee,
299.26	which went to fund their organization.
302.26	So, because I am a trained economist
305.26	and I think in economic terms,
307.26	all of the sudden I thought,
309.26	maybe there is something here.
311.26	Maybe there is a link, a commercial link,
313.26	between one organization and another one.
317.26	But it was only when I interviewed
320.26	Mario Moretti, the head of the Red Brigades,
324.26	the man who kidnapped and killed Aldo Moro,
327.26	Italian former prime minister,
330.26	that I finally realized
332.26	that terrorism is actually business.
335.26	I was having lunch with him
337.26	in a high-security prison in Italy.
339.26	And as we were eating,
342.26	I had the distinct feeling
344.26	that I was back in the city of London,
347.26	having lunch with a fellow banker or an economist.
351.26	This guy thought in the same way I did.
355.26	So, I decided that I wanted to investigate the economics of terrorism.
361.26	Naturally, nobody wanted to fund my research.
365.26	In fact, I think many people thought that I was a bit crazy.
367.26	You know, that woman that goes around to foundations
370.26	asking for money, thinking about the economics of terrorism.
374.26	So, in the end, I took a decision
377.26	that, in retrospect, did change my life.
380.26	I sold my company,
382.26	and funded the research myself.
385.26	And what I discovered
387.26	is this parallel reality,
389.26	another international economic system,
393.26	which runs parallel to our own,
396.26	which has been created by arms organizations
398.26	since the end of World War II.
400.26	And what is even more shocking
402.26	is that this system
406.26	has followed, step by step, the evolution
409.26	of our own system,
411.26	of our Western capitalism.
413.26	And there are three main stages.
416.26	The first one is the state sponsor of terrorism.
419.26	The second one is the privatization of terrorism.
422.26	And the third, of course, is the globalization of terrorism.
426.26	So, state sponsor of terrorism,
429.26	feature of the Cold War.
431.26	This is when the two superpowers were fighting
433.26	a war by proxy,
435.26	along the periphery of the sphere of influence,
438.26	fully funding arms organizations.
441.26	A mix of legal and illegal activities is used.
444.26	So, the link between crime and terror
447.26	is established very early on.
450.26	And here is the best example,
452.26	the Contras in Nicaragua, created by the CIA,
455.26	legally funded by the U.S. Congress,
458.26	illegally funded by the Reagan administration
461.26	via covert operation, for example, the Iran-Contra Affair.
467.26	Then comes the late 1970s, early '80s,
470.26	and some groups successfully carry out
473.26	the privatization of terrorism.
475.26	So, they gain independence from the sponsor,
478.26	and start funding themselves.
482.26	Now, again we see a mix of legal and illegal activities.
487.26	So, Arafat used to get a percentage
490.26	of the smuggling of hashish
493.26	from Bek√°a Valley, which is the valley between Lebanon and Syria.
497.26	And the IRA, which control the private transportation system
501.26	in Northern Ireland, did exactly the same thing.
504.26	So, every single time
506.26	that somebody got into a taxi in Belfast
509.26	without knowing, actually,
511.26	was funding the IRA.
514.26	But the great change came, of course,
516.26	with globalization and deregulation.
519.26	This is when arms organization were able to link up,
522.26	also financially, with each other.
524.26	But above all, they started to do
526.26	serious business with the world of crime.
529.26	And together they money-laundered
531.26	their dirty business through the same channel.
535.26	This is when we see the birth of the transnational
538.26	arms organization Al Qaeda.
541.26	This is an organization that can raise money across border.
544.26	But also that is able to carry out attacks
547.26	in more than one country.
550.26	Now, deregulation also brought back
553.26	rogue economics.
555.26	So what is rogue economics?
557.26	Rogue economics is a force which is constantly
559.26	lurking in the background of history.
563.26	It comes back at times of great transformation,
566.26	globalization being one of those transformations.
569.26	It is at this times in which
572.26	politics actually loses control of the economy,
575.26	and the economy becomes a rogue force
578.26	working against us.
580.26	It has happened before in history.
581.26	It has happened with the fall of the Roman Empire.
585.26	It has happened with Industrial Revolution.
587.26	And it actually happened again, with the fall of the Berlin wall.
592.26	Now, I calculated how big was this international
597.26	economic system composed by crime,
599.26	terror, and illegal economy,
602.26	before 9-11.
604.26	And it is a staggering 1.5 trillion dollars.
609.26	It is trillions, it's not billions.
611.26	This is about twice the GDP of the United Kingdom,
614.26	soon will be more,
616.26	considering where this country is going.
618.26	(Laughter)
621.26	Now, until 9-11,
623.26	the bulk of all this money
625.26	flew into the U.S. economy
627.26	because the bulk of the money was denominated in U.S. dollars
631.26	and the money laundering was taking place
634.26	inside the United States.
636.26	The entry point, of course, of most of this money
639.26	were the off-shore facilities.
641.26	So, this was a vital injection of cash
645.26	into the U.S. economy.
648.26	Now, when I went to look at the figures of the U.S. money supply,
653.26	the U.S. money supply is the amount
655.26	of dollars that the Federal Reserve
658.26	prints every year
660.26	in order to satisfy
662.26	the increase in the demand for dollars,
665.26	which, of course, reflects the growth
667.26	of the economy.
669.26	So, when I went to look at those figures, I noted that since the late 1960s
673.26	a growing number of these dollars
677.26	was actually leaving the United States,
679.26	never to come back.
682.26	These were money taken out
684.26	in suitcases or in containers, in cash of course.
688.26	These were money taken out by criminals and money launderers.
691.26	These were money taken out to fund
694.26	the growth of the terror,
696.26	illegal and criminal economy.
700.26	So, you see, what is the relationship?
704.26	The United States actually is a country
708.26	that is the reserve currency of the world.
712.26	What does it mean? That means that
714.26	it has a privilege that other countries do not have.
717.26	It can borrow against the total amount of dollars
721.26	in circulation in the world.
723.26	This privilege is called seigniorage.
726.26	No other country can do that.
729.26	All the other countries, for example the United Kingdom,
731.26	can borrow only against the amount of money
735.26	in circulation inside its own borders.
739.26	So, here is the implication of the relationship
741.26	between the worlds of crime, terror, and illegal economy, and our economy.
746.26	The U.S. in the 1990s
749.26	was borrowing against the growth
751.26	of the terror, illegal and criminal economy.
755.26	This is how close we are with this world.
760.26	Now, this situation changed, of course, after 9-11,
762.26	because George Bush launched the War on Terror.
765.26	Part of the War on Terror
767.26	was the introduction of the Patriot Act.
770.26	Now, many of you know that the Patriot Act
772.26	is a legislation that greatly reduces
775.26	the liberties of Americans in order to protect them
778.26	against terrorism.
780.26	But there is a section of the Patriot Act
782.26	which refers specifically to finance.
784.26	And it is, in fact, an anti-money-laundering legislation.
788.26	What the Patriot Act did was
790.26	to prohibit U.S. bank,
792.26	and U.S.-registered foreign banks
794.26	from doing any businesses with off-shore facilities.
798.26	It closed that door between the money laundering
801.26	in dollars, and the U.S. economy.
804.26	It also gave the U.S. monetary authorities
809.26	the right to monitor any dollar transaction
812.26	taking place anywhere in the world.
816.26	Now, you can imagine what was the reaction of the international
818.26	finance and banking.
820.26	All the bankers said to their clients,
823.26	"""Get out of the dollars and go and invest somewhere else."""
826.26	Now, the Euro was a newly born currency
829.26	of great opportunity for business, and, of course, for investment.
833.26	And this is what people did.
835.26	Nobody wants the U.S. monetary authority
837.26	to check their relationship,
839.26	to monitor their relationship with their clientele.
843.26	The same thing happened, of course,
845.26	in the world of crime and terror.
849.26	People simply moved their money-laundering activities
854.26	away from the United States
857.26	into Europe.
860.26	Why did this happen? This happened because
862.26	the Patriot Act was a unilateral legislation.
865.26	It was introduced only in the United States.
867.26	And it was introduced only for the U.S. dollars.
870.26	In Europe, a similar legislation
872.26	was not introduced.
874.26	So, within six months
876.26	Europe became the epicenter
878.26	of the money-laundering activities
881.26	of the world.
884.26	So, this is how incredible are the relationship
888.26	between the world of crime
890.26	and the world of terror,
892.26	and our own life.
895.26	So, why did I tell you this story?
897.26	I told you this story because you
899.26	must understand that there is a world
902.26	that goes well beyond the headlines of the newspapers,
906.26	including the personal relationship that you have
908.26	with friends and family.
911.26	You got to question everything that is told to you,
914.26	including what I just told you today.
916.26	(Laughter)
918.26	This is the only way for you
920.26	to step into the dark side, and have a look at it.
923.26	And believe me,
925.26	it's going to be scary.
927.26	It's going to be frightful, but it's going to enlighten you.
930.26	And, above all, it's not going to be boring.
933.26	(Laughter)
935.26	(Applause)
