13.44	Along the ancient path
13.44	of the Monongahela River,
17.223	Braddock, Pennsylvania sits
17.223	in the eastern region of Allegheny County,
22.981	approximately nine miles
22.981	outside of Pittsburgh.
28.488	An industrial suburb,
30.829	Braddock is home
30.829	to Andrew Carnegie's first steel mill,
34.57	the Edgar Thomson Works.
37.008	Operating since 1875,
39.56	it is the last functioning
39.56	steel mill in the region.
45.39	For 12 years, I have produced
45.39	collaborative portraits,
50.101	still lifes, landscapes and aerial views
54.373	in order to build a visual archive
54.373	to address the intersection
59.724	of the steel industry,
61.571	the environment,
63.429	and the health care system's impact
63.429	on the bodies of my family and community.
71.277	The tradition and grand
71.277	narrative of Braddock
74.644	is mostly comprised of stories
74.644	of industrialists and trade unions.
80.727	Currently, the new narrative
80.727	about Braddock,
85.027	a poster child for Rust Belt
85.027	revitalization,
88.564	is a story of urban pioneers
88.564	discovering a new frontier.
94.744	Mass media has omitted the fact
94.744	that Braddock is predominantly black.
101.066	Our existence has been co-opted,
101.066	silenced and erased.
107.731	Fourth generation in a lineage of women,
111.967	I was raised under the protection
111.967	and care of Grandma Ruby,
116.657	off 8th Street
116.657	at 805 Washington Avenue.
121.562	She worked as a manager for Goodwill.
127.02	Mom was a nurse's aid.
128.814	She watched the steel mills close
128.814	and white flight to suburban developments.
136.708	By the time my generation
136.708	walked the streets,
139.332	disinvestment at the local,
139.332	state and federal level,
144.586	eroded infrastructure,
146.483	and the War on Drugs
146.483	dismantled my family and community.
153.89	Grandma Ruby's stepfather Gramps
156.305	was one of few black men to retire
156.305	from Carnegie's mill with his pension.
160.994	He worked in high temperatures,
163.201	tearing down and rebuilding furnaces,
163.201	cleaning up spilt metal and slag.
169.586	The history of a place is written
169.586	on the body and the landscape.
177.766	Areas of heavy truck traffic,
180.244	exposure to benzene and atomized metals,
184.609	risk cancer and lupus.
190.39	One hundred twenty-three licensed beds,
195.847	rehabilitation programs decimated.
203.486	A housing discrimination lawsuit
203.486	against Allegheny County
207.363	removed where the projects
207.363	Talbot Towers once stood.
213.215	Recent rezoning for more light industry
213.215	has since appeared.
219.568	Google Maps and Google Earth pixelations
219.568	conceal the flammable waste
225.595	being used to squeeze the Bunn family
225.595	off their home and land.
233.529	In 2013, I chartered a helicopter
237.545	with my cameras to document
237.545	this aggressive dispossession.
245.371	In flight, my observation reveals
245.371	thousands of plastic white bundles
250.252	owned by a conservation industry
253.728	that claims it's eco-friendly
255.981	and recycles millions of tires
258.697	to preserve people's lives
261.484	and to improve people's lives.
265.5	My work spirals from the micro
265.5	to the macro level,
270.461	excavating hidden histories.
273.688	Recently, at the Seattle Art Museum,
276.196	Isaac Bunn and I mounted this exhibition,
280.166	and the exhibition was used
280.166	as a platform to launch his voice.
286.133	Through reclamation of our narrative,
289.82	we will continue to fight historic erasure
289.82	and socioeconomic inequality.
296.179	Thank you.
298.37	(Applause)
