16.26	Let me introduce to you Rezero.
19.26	This little fellow was developed
21.26	by a group of 10 undergraduate students
23.26	at the Autonomous Systems Laboratory
25.26	at ETH-Zurich.
27.26	Our robot belongs to a family of robots
29.26	called Ballbots.
31.26	Instead of wheels, a Ballbot is balancing
33.26	and moving on one single ball.
35.26	The main characteristics of such a system is
37.26	that there's one sole contact point to the ground.
40.26	This means that the robot
42.26	is inherently unstable.
44.26	It's like when I am trying to stand
46.26	on one foot.
47.26	You might ask yourself, what's the usefulness
49.26	of a robot that's unstable?
51.26	Now we'll explain that in a second.
53.26	Let me first explain how Rezero
55.26	actually keeps his balance.
57.26	Rezero keeps his balance by constantly
59.26	measuring his pitch angle with a sensor.
62.26	He then counteracts and avoids toppling over
65.26	by turning the motors appropriately.
67.26	This happens 160 times per second,
69.26	and if anything fails in this process,
71.26	Rezero would immediately fall to the ground.
74.26	Now to move and to balance,
76.26	Rezero needs to turn the ball.
78.26	The ball is driven by three special wheels
80.26	that allow Rezero to move into any direction
83.26	and also move around his own axis
85.26	at the same time.
89.26	Due to his instability, Rezero is always
91.26	in motion. Now here's the trick.
93.26	It's indeed exactly this instability that allows
96.26	a robot to move very [dynamically].
98.26	Let's play a little.
100.26	You may have wondered what happens
102.26	if I give the robot a little push.
107.26	In this mode, he's trying to maintain
109.26	his position.
112.26	For the next demo, I'd like you to introduce
115.26	to my colleagues Michael, on the computer,
118.26	and Thomas who's helping me onstage.
122.26	In the next mode, Rezero is passive,
124.26	and we can move him around.
128.26	With almost no force I can control
130.26	his position and his velocity.
136.26	I can also make him spin.
150.26	In the next mode, we can get Rezero
152.26	to follow a person.
155.26	He's now keeping a constant distance to Thomas.
162.26	This works with a laser sensor
164.26	that's mounted on top of Rezero.
170.26	With the same method, we can also
172.26	get him to circle a person.
177.26	We call this the orbiting mode.
190.26	All right, thank you, Thomas.
192.26	(Applause)
196.26	Now, what's the use of this technology?
202.26	For now, it's an experiment, but let me
204.26	show you some possible future applications.
208.26	Rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks.
210.26	With a screen it could inform people or show
212.26	them around in a fun and entertaining way.
215.26	In a hospital, this device could be used to
217.26	carry around medical equipment.
219.26	Due to the Ballbot system, it has a very small
221.26	footprint and it's also easy to move around.
224.26	And of course, who wouldn't like
226.26	to take a ride on one of these.
229.26	And these are more practical applications.
231.26	But there's also a certain beauty
233.26	within this technology.
235.26	(Music)
298.26	(Applause)
299.26	Thank you.
301.26	(Applause)
305.26	Thank you.
