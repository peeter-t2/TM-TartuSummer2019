13.14	The most romantic thing to ever happen to me online
16.015	started out the way most things do:
18.388	without me, and not online.
21.911	On December 10, 1896, the man on the medal,
24.819	Alfred Nobel, died.
26.654	One hundred years later, exactly, actually,
28.91	December 10, 1996,
30.476	this charming lady, Wislawa Szymborska,
32.475	won the Nobel Prize for literature.
34.636	She's a Polish poet.
36.277	She's a big deal, obviously,
37.525	but back in '96, I thought I had never heard of her,
40.164	and when I checked out her work,
41.683	I found this sweet little poem,
43.179	"""Four in the Morning."""
44.78	"""The hour from night to day."
46.045	The hour from side to side.
47.431	"The hour for those past thirty..."""
49.229	And it goes on, but as soon as I read this poem,
51.316	I fell for it hard,
53.239	so hard, I suspected we must have met
56.18	somewhere before.
57.593	Had I shared an elevator ride with this poem?
59.892	Did I flirt with this poem
61.412	in a coffee shop somewhere?
62.557	I could not place it, and it bugged me,
64.069	and then in the coming week or two,
65.971	I would just be watching an old movie,
67.42	and this would happen.
68.702	(Video) Groucho Marx: Charlie, you
68.702	should have come to the first party.
69.965	We didn't get home till around four in the morning.
72.317	Rives: My roommates would have the TV on,
74.589	and this would happen.
76.271	(Music: Seinfeld theme)
77.89	(Video) George Costanza: Oh boy, 
77.89	I was up til four in the morning
79.671	watching that Omen trilogy.
82.36	Rives: I would be listening to music,
83.597	and this would happen.
85.124	(Video) Elton John: ♪ It's four o'clock
85.124	in the morning, damn it. ♪
87.938	Rives: So you can see what was going on, right?
90.139	Obviously, the demigods of coincidence
93.13	were just messing with me.
94.818	Some people get a number stuck in their head,
96.309	you may recognize a certain name or a tune,
98.914	some people get nothing, but four in the morning
100.699	was in me now, but mildly,
103.6	like a groin injury.
106.114	I always assumed it would just go away
107.586	on its own eventually,
109.095	and I never talked about it with anybody,
110.681	but it did not, and I totally did.
114.233	In 2007, I was invited to speak at TED
116.314	for the second time,
117.23	and since I was still an authority on nothing,
119.732	I thought, what if I made a multimedia presentation
123.123	on a topic so niche
124.711	it is actually inconsequential
126.558	or actually cockamamie.
127.971	So my talk had some of my
127.971	four in the morning examples,
131.147	but it also had examples
132.525	from my fellow TED speakers that year.
134.581	I found four in the morning in a novel
136.035	by Isabel Allende.
137.311	I found a really great one
138.842	in the autobiography of Bill Clinton.
140.998	I found a couple in the work of Matt Groening,
142.643	although Matt Groening told me later
144.08	that he could not make my talk
144.898	because it was a morning session
146.662	and I gather that he is not an early riser.
149.382	However, had Matt been there,
152.97	he would have seen this mock conspiracy theory
155.948	that was un-freaking-canny for me to assemble.
158.563	It was totally contrived
159.724	just for that room, just for that moment.
161.74	That's how we did it in the pre-TED.com days.
163.897	It was fun. That was pretty much it.
166.556	When I got home, though,
166.556	the emails started coming in
169.531	from people who had seen the talk live,
170.97	beginning with, and this is still my favorite,
173.264	"""Here's another one for your collection:"
174.931	'It's the friends you can call
174.931	"up at 4 a.m. that matter.'"""
177.571	The sentiment is Marlene Dietrich.
179.411	The email itself was from another very
182.392	sexy European type,
184.453	TED Curator Chris Anderson.
186.941	(Laughter)
188.353	Chris found this quote
189.805	on a coffee cup or something,
191.207	and I'm thinking, this man is the Typhoid Mary
193.67	of ideas worth spreading, and I have infected him.
195.809	I am contagious,
197.024	which was confirmed less than a week later
200.031	when a Hallmark employee scanned and sent
202.07	an actual greeting card
203.312	with that same quotation.
204.692	As a bonus, she hooked me up
204.692	with a second one they make.
207.929	"It says, ""Just knowing I can call you"
209.549	at four in the morning if I need to
210.964	"makes me not really need to,"""
212.012	which I love, because together these are like,
213.685	"""Hallmark: When you care enough"
215.375	to send the very best twice,
217.438	"phrased slightly differently."""
219.406	I was not surprised at the TEDster
223.338	and New Yorker magazine overlap.
225.05	A bunch of people sent me this when it came out.
227.075	"""It's 4 a.m.—maybe you'd sleep"
227.075	"better if you bought some crap."""
230.135	"I was surprised at the TEDster/""Rugrats"" overlap."
233.877	More than one person sent me this.
235.637	(Video) Didi Pickles: It's
235.637	four o'clock in the morning.
237.516	Why on Earth are you making chocolate pudding?
239.748	Stu Pickles: Because I've lost control of my life.
241.884	(Laughter)
244.01	Rives: And then there was the lone TEDster
245.607	who was disgruntled I had overlooked
247.487	what he considers to be a classic.
249.503	(Video) Roy Neary: Get up, get up! I'm not kidding.
249.503	Ronnie Neary: Is there an accident?
252.422	Roy: No, it's not an accident. You
252.422	wanted to get out of the house anyway, right?
255.847	Ronnie: Not at four o'clock in the morning.
257.983	"Rives: So that's ""Close Encounters,"""
259.177	and the main character is all worked up
260.501	because aliens, momentously,
262.017	have chosen to show themselves to earthlings
263.539	at four in the morning,
264.565	which does make that a very solid example.
266.319	Those were all really solid examples.
268.343	They did not get me any closer to understanding
270.31	why I thought I recognized this one particular poem.
272.911	But they followed the pattern. They played along.
274.999	Right? Four in the morning as this scapegoat hour
277.783	when all these dramatic occurrences
279.553	allegedly occur.
281.919	Maybe this was some kind of cliche
283.591	that had never been taxonomized before.
285.439	Maybe I was on the trail
287.189	of a new meme or something.
288.255	Just when things were getting pretty interesting,
291.027	things got really interesting.
292.636	TED.com launched, later that year,
294.991	with a bunch of videos from past talks,
296.823	including mine,
297.723	"and I started receiving ""four in the morning"" citations"
300.597	from what seemed like every
300.597	time zone on the planet.
303.16	Much of it was content I never would have found
305.871	on my own if I was looking for it,
307.295	and I was not.
308.833	I don't know anybody with juvenile diabetes.
310.48	I probably would have missed the booklet,
312.11	"""Grilled Cheese at Four O'Clock in the Morning."""
313.647	(Laughter)
316.57	I do not subscribe to Crochet Today! magazine,
319.475	although it looks delightful. (Laughter)
323.967	Take note of those clock ends.
325.279	This is a college student's suggestion
326.619	"for what a ""four in the morning"" gang sign"
328.285	should look like.
330.639	People sent me magazine ads.
332.727	They took photographs in grocery stores.
334.81	I got a ton of graphic novels and comics.
338.277	A lot of good quality work, too:
339.981	"""The Sandman,"" ""Watchmen."""
341.65	There's a very cute example
341.65	"here from ""Calvin and Hobbes."""
344.081	In fact, the oldest citation anybody sent in
347.186	was from a cartoon from the Stone Age.
349.621	Take a look.
351.283	(Video) Wilma Flintstone: Like how early?
353.17	Fred Flintstone: Like at 4 a.m., that's how early.
356.287	Rives: And the flip side of the timeline,
358.007	this is from the 31st century.
359.572	A thousand years from now,
360.769	people are still doing this.
363.565	(Video): Announcer: The time is 4 a.m.
366.105	(Laughter)
367.192	Rives: It shows the spectrum.
368.386	I received so many songs, TV shows, movies,
372.22	like from dismal to famous,
374.4	I could give you a four-hour playlist.
376.362	If I just stick to modern male movie stars,
378.736	I keep it to the length
379.932	of about a commercial.
381.268	Here's your sampler.
382.998	"(Movie montage of ""It's 4 a.m."")"
409.932	(Laughter)
412.384	Rives: So somewhere along the line,
414.526	I realized I have a hobby
416.272	I didn't know I wanted,
418.29	and it is crowdsourced.
420.96	But I was also thinking what you might be thinking,
423.322	which is really, couldn't you do this
424.944	with any hour of the day?
426.05	First of all, you are not getting clips like that
427.688	about four in the afternoon.
429.272	Secondly, I did a little research.
430.976	You know, I was kind of interested.
432.448	If this is confirmation bias,
434.656	there is so much confirmation, I am biased.
437.267	Literature probably shows it best.
438.513	There are a couple three in
438.513	the mornings in Shakespeare.
440.657	There's a five in the morning.
442	There are seven four in the mornings,
443.388	and they're all very dire.
444.241	"In ""Measure for Measure,"" it's"
444.241	the call time for the executioner.
447.592	Tolstoy gives Napoleon insomnia
450.488	at four in the morning right before battle
452.32	"in ""War and Peace."""
454.03	"Charlotte Brontë's ""Jane Eyre"" has got kind of"
455.746	a pivotal four in the morning,
456.875	"as does Emily Brontë's ""Wuthering Heights."""
460.103	"""Lolita"" has as a creepy four in the morning."
463.301	"""Huckleberry Finn"" has one in dialect."
467.033	"Someone sent in H.G. Wells' ""The Invisible Man."""
470.13	"Someone else sent in Ralph Ellison's ""Invisible Man."""
473.241	"""The Great Gatsby"" spends the last"
475.641	four in the morning of his life
477.251	waiting for a lover who never shows,
479.449	and the most famous wake-up in literature, perhaps,
482.08	"""The Metamorphosis."""
483.569	First paragraph, the main character wakes up
485.721	transformed into a giant cockroach,
487.761	but we already know, cockroach notwithstanding,
490.967	something is up with this guy.
492.89	Why? His alarm is set for four o'clock in the morning.
495.81	What kind of person would do that?
499.159	This kind of person would do that.
501.178	(Music)
505.49	(4 a.m. alarm clock montage)
510.784	(Video) Newcaster: Top of the hour.
510.784	Time for the morning news.
513.395	But of course, there is no news yet.
514.649	Everyone's still asleep in their comfy, comfy beds.
517.974	Rives: Exactly.
519.474	So that's Lucy from the Peanuts,
521.404	"""Mommie Dearest"", Rocky, first day of training,"
523.8	Nelson Mandela, first day in office,
525.516	and Bart Simpson, which combined with a cockroach
528.235	would give you one hell of a dinner party
530.804	and gives me yet another category,
532.73	people waking up, in my big old database.
535.35	Just imagine that your friends and your family
537.78	have heard that you collect, say, stuffed polar bears,
540.996	and they send them to you.
542.259	Even if you don't really, at a certain point,
545.108	you totally collect stuffed polar bears,
548.148	and your collection is probably pretty kick-ass.
550.71	And when I got to that point, I embraced it.
552.422	I got my curator on. I started fact checking,
555.146	downloading, illegally screen-grabbing.
558.289	I started archiving.
559.66	My hobby had become a habit,
561.847	and my habit gave me possibly the world's
564.573	most eclectic Netflix queue.
567.421	"At one point, it went, ""Guys and Dolls: The Musical,"""
570.311	"""Last Tango in Paris,"""
571.699	"""Diary of a Wimpy Kid,"""
572.949	"""Porn Star: Legend of Ron Jeremy."""
574.623	"Why ""Porn Star: Legend of Ron Jeremy""?"
576.523	Because someone told me I
576.523	would find this clip in there.
579.183	(Video) Ron Jeremy: I was born
580.647	in Flushing, Queens
582.415	on March, 12, 1953,
585.183	at four o'clock in the morning.
587.08	Rives: Of course he was. (Laughter) (Applause)
588.8	Yeah. Not only does it seem to make sense,
591.693	it also answers the question,
594.269	"""What do Ron Jeremy and Simone de Beauvoir"
596.579	"have in common?"""
598.701	Simone de Beauvoir begins her entire autobiography
601.157	"with the sentence, ""I was born"
601.157	"at four o'clock in the morning,"""
603.365	which I had because someone
603.365	else had emailed it to me,
605.541	and when they did, I had another bump up
608.17	in my entry for this, because porn star Ron Jeremy
611.39	and feminist Simone de Beauvoir
613.057	are not just different people.
614.309	They are different people that
614.309	have this thing connecting them,
617.189	and I did not know if that is trivia or knowledge
620.586	or inadvertent expertise, but I did wonder,
623.213	is there maybe a cooler way to do this?
625.07	So last October, in gentleman scholar tradition,
629.582	I put the entire collection online
631.796	"as ""Museum of Four in the Morning."""
633.428	"You can click on that red ""refresh"" button."
635.426	It will take you at random to one of
637.71	hundreds of snippets that are in the collection.
640.008	Here is a knockout poem
641.656	"by Billy Collins called ""Forgetfulness."""
644.149	(Video) Billy Collins: No wonder you rise
645.514	in the middle of the night
647.194	to look up the date of a famous battle
649.751	in a book on war.
651.38	No wonder the moon in the window
654.13	seems to have drifted out of a love poem
656.878	that you used to know by heart.
659.798	Rives: So the first hour of this project
663.19	was satisfying.
664.222	A Bollywood actor sang a line on a DVD in a cafe.
668.922	Half a globe away, a teenager
671.166	made an Instagram video of it and sent it to me,
673.566	a stranger.
674.91	Less than a week later, though,
676.088	I received a little bit of grace.
679.344	I received a poignant tweet.
683.606	It was brief.
685.528	"It just said, ""Reminds me of an ancient mix tape."""
689.67	The name was a pseudonym,
689.67	actually, or a pseudo-pseudonym.
692.268	As soon as I saw the initials, and the profile pic,
695.2	I knew immediately, my whole body knew
697.366	immediately who this was,
700.006	and I knew immediately
702.2	what mix tape she was talking about.
705.262	(Music)
708.771	L.D. was my college romance.
711.044	This is in the early '90s. I was an undegrad.
713.841	She was a grad student in the
713.841	library sciences department.
717.159	Not the kind of librarian that takes her glasses off,
719.232	lets her hair down, suddenly she's smoking hot.
721.408	She was already smoking hot,
723.17	she was super dorky,
724.56	and we had a December-May romance,
726.922	meaning we started dating in December,
728.84	and by May, she had graduated
731.135	and became my one that got away.
734.581	But her mix tape did not get away.
738.728	I have kept this mix tape in a box
741.584	with notes and postcards, not just from L.D.,
744.311	from my life, but for decades.
747	It's the kind of box where,
748.31	if I have a girlfriend, I tend to hide it from her,
750.428	and if I had a wife, I'm sure I would share it with her,
752.138	but the story — (Laughter) — with this mix tape
755.504	is there are seven songs per side,
757.392	but no song titles.
759.448	Instead, L.D. has used the U.S. Library of Congress
762.72	classification system, including page numbers,
765.439	to leave me clues.
767.664	When I got this mix tape,
769.296	I put it in my cassette player,
770.928	I took it to the campus library, her library,
774.312	I found 14 books on the shelves.
776.16	I remember bringing them all
777.582	to my favorite corner table,
779.186	and I read poems paired to songs
783.199	like food to wine,
784.86	paired, I can tell you,
786.8	like saddle shoes
788.583	to a cobalt blue vintage cotton dress.
791.589	I did this again last October.
793.993	I'm sitting there, I got new earbuds,
796.115	old Walkman, I realize this is just the kind
798.677	of extravagance I used to take for granted
800.771	even when I was extravagant.
802.787	"And then I thought, ""Good for him."""
806.212	"""PG"" is Slavic literature."
809.555	"""7000"" series Polish literature."
812.603	Z9A24 is a collection of 70 poems.
815.253	Page 31 is Wislawa Szymborska's poem
818.402	"paired with Paul Simon's ""Peace Like a River."""
820.62	"(Music: Paul Simon, ""Peace Like a River"")"
824.065	(Video) Paul Simon: ♪ Oh, four in the morning ♪
825.961	♪ I woke up from out of my dream ♪
831.323	Rives: Thank you. Appreciate it. (Applause)
