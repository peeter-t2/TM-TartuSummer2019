13.393	The philosopher Plato once said,
16.051	"""Music gives a soul to the universe,"
18.824	wings to the mind,
20.442	flight to the imagination
22.488	"and life to everything."""
25.613	Music has always been
25.613	a big part of my life.
27.925	To create and to perform music
30.319	connects you to people
30.319	countries and lifetimes away.
33.597	It connects you to the people
33.597	you're playing with,
35.974	to your audience
37.186	and to yourself.
38.952	When I'm happy, when I'm sad,
41.127	when I'm bored, when I'm stressed,
43.351	I listen to and I create music.
47.536	When I was younger, I played piano;
49.831	later, I took up guitar.
51.252	And as I started high school,
53.109	music became a part of my identity.
55.329	I was in every band,
56.77	I was involved with every
56.77	musical fine arts event.
59.978	Music surrounded me.
61.409	It made me who I was,
62.788	and it gave me a place to belong.
66.476	Now, I've always had
66.476	this thing with rhythms.
68.597	I remember being young,
69.79	I would walk down
69.79	the hallways of my school
71.878	and I would tap rhythms to myself
71.878	on my leg with my hands,
74.892	or tapping my teeth.
77.504	It was a nervous habit,
79.007	and I was always nervous.
80.66	I think I liked the repetition
80.66	of the rhythm --
82.97	it was calming.
85.777	Then in high school,
86.951	I started music theory,
88.488	and it was the best class I've ever taken.
90.742	We were learning about music --
92.3	things I didn't know,
92.3	like theory and history.
95.656	It was a class where we basically
95.656	just listened to a song,
99.08	talked about what it meant to us
100.732	and analyzed it,
101.942	and figured out what made it tick.
105.53	Every Wednesday, we did something
105.53	"called ""rhythmic dictation,"""
108.614	and I was pretty good at it.
110.592	Our teacher would give us
110.592	an amount of measures
112.871	and a time signature,
114.388	and then he would speak a rhythm to us
116.276	and we would have to write it down
116.276	with the proper rests and notes.
120.232	Like this:
122.442	ta ta tuck-a tuck-a ta,
124.943	ta tuck-a-tuck-a-tuck-a, tuck-a.
128.652	And I loved it.
129.981	The simplicity of the rhythm --
131.483	a basic two- to four- measure line --
133.665	and yet each of them almost told a story,
137.417	like they had so much potential,
141.07	and all you had to do was add a melody.
145.4	(Guitar)
153.408	Rhythms set a foundation for melodies
153.408	and harmonies to play on top of.
157.808	It gives structure and stability.
161.34	Now, music has these parts --
163.044	rhythm, melody and harmony --
165.203	just like our lives.
167.372	Where music has rhythm,
169.432	we have routines and habits --
171.71	things that help us to remember
171.71	what to do and to stay on track,
174.999	and to just keep going.
178.05	And you may not notice it,
179.899	but it's always there.
182.486	(Guitar)
184.879	And it may seem simple,
186.72	it may seem dull by itself,
190.407	but it gives tempo and heartbeat.
195.443	And then things in your life add on to it,
197.9	giving texture --
199.726	that's your friends and your family,
201.503	and anything that creates
201.503	a harmonic structure in your life
205.163	and in your song,
206.772	like harmonies,
208.458	cadences
209.639	and anything that makes it polyphonic.
214.198	And they create beautiful
214.198	chords and patterns.
216.609	(Guitar)
219.174	And then there's you.
221.221	You play on top of everything else,
225.141	on top of the rhythms and the beat
229.679	because you're the melody.
232.974	And things may change and develop,
237.046	but no matter what we do,
238.63	we're still the same people.
241.93	Throughout a song melodies develop,
244.135	but it's still the same song.
247.073	No matter what you do,
248.881	the rhythms are still there:
250.831	the tempo and the heartbeat ...
256.029	until I left,
258.975	and I went to college
260.588	and everything disappeared.
264.431	When I first arrived at university,
266.654	I felt lost.
268.534	And don't get me wrong --
268.534	sometimes I loved it and it was great,
271.588	but other times,
274.781	I felt like I had been left alone
277.79	to fend for myself.
280.423	It's like I had been taken out
280.423	of my natural environment,
283.261	and put somewhere new,
284.63	where the rhythms and the harmonies
287.486	and the form had gone away,
291.458	and it was just me --
292.851	(Guitar)
294.2	silence and my melody.
299.75	And even that began to waver,
302.269	because I didn't know what I was doing.
304.894	I didn't have any chords
304.894	to structure myself,
308.209	or a rhythm
310.06	or a beat to know the tempo.
311.811	(Guitar)
315.305	And then I began to hear
315.305	all these other sounds.
317.641	(Guitar)
319.49	And they were off-time
322.599	and off-key.
326.764	And the more I was around them,
329.536	the more my melody started
329.536	to sound like theirs.
336.08	And slowly I began to lose myself,
340.335	like I was being washed away.
345.004	But then the next moment --
346.525	(Guitar)
348.535	I could hear it.
351.454	And I could feel it.
355.07	And it was me.
357.284	And I was here.
359.555	And it was different,
362.639	but not worse off.
366.228	Just changed a little.
371.346	Music is my way of coping
371.346	with the changes in my life.
376.258	There's a beautiful connection
376.258	between music and life.
379.307	It can bind us to reality
380.637	at the same time
380.637	it allows us to escape it.
383.053	Music is something
383.053	that lives inside of you.
385.597	You create it and you're created by it.
389.547	Our lives are not only conducted by music,
392.683	they're also composed of it.
395.348	So this may seem like a bit of a stretch,
397.484	but hear me out:
399.075	music is a fundamental part of what we are
402.689	and of everything around us.
405.096	Now, music is my passion,
406.54	but physics also used to be
406.54	an interest of mine.
409.469	And the more I learned,
410.65	the more I saw connections
410.65	between the two --
413.498	especially regarding string theory.
417.095	I know this is only one of many theories,
419.857	but it spoke to me.
422.211	So, one aspect of string theory,
422.211	at its simplest form, is this:
427.131	matter is made up of atoms,
429.181	which are made up of protons
429.181	and neutrons and electrons,
432.423	which are made up of quark.
434.173	And here's where the string part comes in.
436.23	This quark is supposedly made up
436.23	of little coiled strings,
440.516	and it's the vibrations of these strings
440.516	that make everything what it is.
445.571	Michio Kaku once explained this
447.146	in a lecture called,
447.146	"""The Universe in a Nutshell,"""
450.102	where he says,
452.324	"""String theory is the simple idea"
454.588	that the four forces of the universe --
456.64	gravity, the electromagnetic force,
456.64	and the two strong forces --
460.85	can be viewed as music.
462.849	"The music of tiny little rubber bands."""
466.444	In this lecture, he goes on
466.444	to explain physics
468.783	as the laws of harmony
468.783	between these strings;
471.216	chemistry, as the melodies
471.216	you can play on these strings;
474.965	and he states that the universe
474.965	"is a ""symphony of strings."""
481.259	These strings dictate the universe;
483.351	they make up everything we see
483.351	and everything we know.
486.908	They're musical notes,
488.142	but they make us what we are
488.142	and they hold us together.
492.177	So you see,
494.087	everything is music.
496.291	(Guitar)
497.679	When I look at the world,
499.833	I see music all around us.
505.084	When I look at myself,
507.634	I see music.
513.168	And my life has been defined by music.
517.288	I found myself through music.
521.181	Music is everywhere,
523.657	and it is in everything.
528.231	And it changes and it builds
531.041	and it diminishes.
534.39	But it's always there,
536.591	supporting us,
538.249	connecting us to each other
540.991	and showing us the beauty of the universe.
544.868	So if you ever feel lost,
547.211	stop and listen for your song.
550.361	Thank you.
552.498	(Applause)
