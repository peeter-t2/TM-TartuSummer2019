12.833	So in the oasis of 
12.833	intelligentsia that is TED,
18.567	I stand here before you this evening
21.285	as an expert in dragging heavy
21.285	stuff around cold places.
27.159	I've been leading polar expeditions 
27.159	for most of my adult life,
30.145	and last month, my teammate 
30.145	Tarka L'Herpiniere and I
33.847	finished the most ambitious 
33.847	expedition I've ever attempted.
39.025	In fact, it feels like I've been
39.025	transported straight here
42.014	from four months in the middle of nowhere,
44.666	mostly grunting and swearing, 
44.666	straight to the TED stage.
49.754	So you can imagine that's a transition
49.754	that hasn't been entirely seamless.
53.935	One of the interesting side effects
55.815	seems to be that my short-term
55.815	memory is entirely shot.
58.403	So I've had to write some notes
60.665	to avoid too much grunting and swearing
60.665	in the next 17 minutes.
65.363	This is the first talk I've given
65.363	about this expedition,
68.211	and while we weren't sequencing genomes
68.211	or building space telescopes,
73.69	this is a story about giving everything
73.69	we had to achieve something
78.474	that hadn't been done before.
80.31	So I hope in that you might 
80.31	find some food for thought.
84.455	It was a journey, an 
84.455	expedition in Antarctica,
88.066	the coldest, windiest, driest and
88.066	highest altitude continent on Earth.
92.757	It's a fascinating place.
92.757	It's a huge place.
94.804	It's twice the size of Australia,
97.119	a continent that is the same size
97.119	as China and India put together.
102.22	As an aside, I have experienced 
104.088	an interesting phenomenon
104.088	in the last few days,
106.312	something that I expect Chris Hadfield
106.312	may get at TED in a few years' time,
110.089	conversations that go something like this:
112.144	"""Oh, Antarctica. Awesome."
113.767	My husband and I did Antarctica
113.767	"with Lindblad for our anniversary."""
119.604	"Or, ""Oh cool, did you go there"
119.604	"for the marathon?"""
122.951	(Laughter)
126.445	Our journey was, in fact,
130.485	in 105 days, an 1,800-mile round trip
130.485	on foot from the coast of Antarctica
136.476	to the South Pole and back again.
139.247	In the process, we broke the record
141.491	for the longest human-powered polar
141.491	journey in history by more than 400 miles.
147.087	(Applause)
151.498	For those of you from the Bay Area,
153.913	it was the same as walking from 
153.913	here to San Francisco,
158.03	then turning around
158.03	and walking back again.
160.908	So as camping trips go, it was a long one,
165.827	and one I've seen summarized 
165.827	most succinctly here
168.994	on the hallowed pages 
168.994	of Business Insider Malaysia.
172.72	"[""Two Explorers Just Completed A Polar Expedition "
172.72	"That Killed Everyone The Last Time It Was Attempted""]"
178.247	Chris Hadfield talked so eloquently
180.917	about fear and about the odds of success,
180.917	and indeed the odds of survival.
186.139	Of the nine people in history that had
186.139	attempted this journey before us,
190.019	none had made it to the pole and back,
192.712	and five had died in the process.
196.59	This is Captain Robert Falcon Scott.
199.237	He led the last team
199.237	to attempt this expedition.
202	Scott and his rival Sir Ernest Shackleton,
204.438	over the space of a decade,
207.154	both led expeditions battling to become
207.154	the first to reach the South Pole,
211.427	to chart and map
211.427	the interior of Antarctica,
214.446	a place we knew less about, at the time,
216.581	than the surface of the moon,
218.485	because we could see
218.485	the moon through telescopes.
220.83	Antarctica was, for the most part,
220.83	a century ago, uncharted.
224.964	Some of you may know the story.
226.475	Scott's last expedition, the 
226.475	Terra Nova Expedition in 1910,
229.288	started as a giant
229.288	siege-style approach.
231.802	He had a big team using ponies,
234.031	using dogs, using petrol-driven tractors,
236.778	dropping multiple, pre-positioned
236.778	depots of food and fuel
240.175	through which Scott's final team of five
240.175	would travel to the Pole,
243.883	where they would turn around and ski 
243.883	back to the coast again on foot.
247.187	Scott and his final team of five
249.599	arrived at the South Pole 
249.599	in January 1912
253.284	to find they had been beaten to it
253.284	by a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen,
258.274	who rode on dogsled.
259.908	Scott's team ended up on foot.
261.997	And for more than a century
261.997	this journey has remained unfinished.
266.595	Scott's team of five died 
266.595	on the return journey.
269.52	And for the last decade,
271.633	I've been asking myself why that is.
274.954	How come this has remained 
274.954	the high-water mark?
278.246	Scott's team covered 1,600 miles on foot.
280.596	No one's come close to that ever since.
282.497	So this is the high-water mark 
282.497	of human endurance,
285.318	human endeavor, 
285.318	human athletic achievement
287.839	in arguably the harshest climate on Earth.
290.51	It was as if the marathon record
293.018	has remained unbroken since 1912.
296.037	And of course some strange and 
296.037	predictable combination of curiosity,
301.145	stubbornness, and probably hubris
303.095	led me to thinking I might be the man
303.095	to try to finish the job.
307.182	Unlike Scott's expedition,
307.182	there were just two of us,
310.873	and we set off from the coast
310.873	of Antarctica in October last year,
313.996	dragging everything ourselves,
316.214	"a process Scott called ""man-hauling."""
318.814	When I say it was like walking from
318.814	here to San Francisco and back,
321.837	I actually mean it was like dragging
321.837	something that weighs a shade more
325.214	than the heaviest ever NFL player.
327.638	Our sledges weighed 200 kilos,
329.681	or 440 pounds each at the start,
332.746	the same weights that the weakest
332.746	of Scott's ponies pulled.
337.02	Early on, we averaged 0.5 miles per hour.
340.2	Perhaps the reason no one had 
340.2	attempted this journey until now,
343.887	in more than a century,
345.145	was that no one had been quite
345.145	stupid enough to try.
350.418	And while I can't claim we were exploring
352.437	in the genuine Edwardian
352.437	sense of the word —
355.454	we weren't naming any mountains
355.454	or mapping any uncharted valleys —
359.192	I think we were stepping into uncharted
359.192	territory in a human sense.
363.573	Certainly, if in the future we learn
363.573	there is an area of the human brain
366.962	that lights up when one curses oneself,
370.779	I won't be at all surprised.
373.945	You've heard that the average American
373.945	spends 90 percent of their time indoors.
377.997	We didn't go indoors
377.997	for nearly four months.
381.253	We didn't see a sunset either.
383.495	It was 24-hour daylight.
385.151	Living conditions were quite spartan.
387.306	I changed my underwear 
387.306	three times in 105 days
392.148	and Tarka and I shared 
396.072	Though we did have some technology
396.072	that Scott could never have imagined.
400.813	And we blogged live every evening
400.813	from the tent via a laptop
404.18	and a custom-made satellite transmitter,
406.225	all of which were solar-powered:
408.085	we had a flexible photovoltaic
408.085	panel over the tent.
410.482	And the writing was important to me.
413.94	As a kid, I was inspired by the 
413.94	literature of adventure and exploration,
420.493	and I think we've all seen
420.493	here this week
423.021	the importance and 
423.021	the power of storytelling.
427.265	So we had some 21st-century gear,
429.081	but the reality is that the 
429.081	challenges that Scott faced
431.868	were the same that we faced:
433.865	those of the weather and of 
433.865	what Scott called glide,
437.603	the amount of friction between
437.603	the sledges and the snow.
440.951	The lowest wind chill 
440.951	we experienced was in the -70s,
444.801	and we had zero visibility,
444.801	what's called white-out,
447.378	for much of our journey.
450.391	We traveled up and down one of the largest
452.742	and most dangerous glaciers
452.742	in the world, the Beardmore glacier.
455.955	It's 110 miles long; most of its surface
455.955	is what's called blue ice.
459.381	You can see it's a beautiful, 
459.381	shimmering steel-hard blue surface
462.979	covered with thousands 
462.979	and thousands of crevasses,
466.817	these deep cracks in the glacial ice 
466.817	up to 200 feet deep.
470.798	Planes can't land here,
472.315	so we were at the most risk,
475.775	technically, when we had the slimmest
475.775	chance of being rescued.
480.219	We got to the South Pole
480.219	after 61 days on foot,
484.115	with one day off for bad weather,
486.694	and I'm sad to say, it was
486.694	something of an anticlimax.
489.261	There's a permanent American base,
491.726	the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station
491.726	at the South Pole.
495.044	They have an airstrip,
495.044	they have a canteen,
496.995	they have hot showers,
498.448	they have a post office, a tourist shop,
500.353	a basketball court that doubles
500.353	as a movie theater.
504.091	So it's a bit different these days,
506.066	and there are also acres of junk.
507.862	I think it's a marvelous thing
509.292	that humans can exist
514.586	with hamburgers and hot showers
514.586	and movie theaters,
518.131	but it does seem to produce
518.131	a lot of empty cardboard boxes.
520.887	You can see on the left of 
520.887	this photograph,
522.949	several square acres of junk
524.384	waiting to be flown out
524.384	from the South Pole.
526.897	But there is also a pole at the South Pole,
530.929	and we got there on foot, unassisted,
534.325	unsupported, by the hardest route,
538.316	dragging more weight
538.316	than anyone in history.
540.364	And if we'd stopped there 
540.364	and flown home,
542.333	which would have been
542.333	the eminently sensible thing to do,
545.467	then my talk would end here
547.348	and it would end something like this.
550.938	If you have the right team around you,
550.938	the right tools, the right technology,
555.743	and if you have enough self-belief
555.743	and enough determination,
559.481	then anything is possible.
564.656	But then we turned around,
567.289	and this is where things get interesting.
570.048	High on the Antarctic plateau,
572.842	over 10,000 feet, it's very windy,
572.842	very cold, very dry, we were exhausted.
576.841	We'd covered 35 marathons,
578.711	we were only halfway,
580.297	and we had a safety net, of course,
582.328	of ski planes and satellite phones
584.452	and live, 24-hour tracking beacons
584.452	that didn't exist for Scott,
588.515	but in hindsight,
590.257	rather than making our lives easier,
592.323	the safety net actually allowed us
594.482	to cut things very fine indeed,
598.337	to sail very close to our absolute
598.337	limits as human beings.
602.104	And it is an exquisite form of torture
605.577	to exhaust yourself to the point
605.577	of starvation day after day
608.414	while dragging a sledge
608.414	full of food.
612.686	For years, I'd been writing glib lines
612.686	in sponsorship proposals
616.613	about pushing the limits
616.613	of human endurance,
619.724	but in reality, that was 
619.724	a very frightening place to be indeed.
624.136	We had, before we'd got to the Pole,
626.045	two weeks of almost permanent
626.045	headwind, which slowed us down.
629.509	As a result, we'd had several days
629.509	of eating half rations.
632.159	We had a finite amount of food
632.159	in the sledges to make this journey,
634.878	so we were trying to string that out
636.88	by reducing our intake to half 
636.88	the calories we should have been eating.
640.793	As a result, we both became
640.793	increasingly hypoglycemic —
644.412	we had low blood sugar 
644.412	levels day after day —
647.236	and increasingly susceptible
647.236	to the extreme cold.
651.994	Tarka took this photo of me one evening
654.097	after I'd nearly passed out
654.097	with hypothermia.
656.227	We both had repeated bouts of hypothermia,
656.227	something I hadn't experienced before,
661.035	and it was very humbling indeed.
662.746	As much as you might
662.746	like to think, as I do,
666.414	that you're the kind
666.414	of person who doesn't quit,
668.67	that you'll go down swinging,
670.664	hypothermia doesn't leave you much choice.
672.916	You become utterly incapacitated.
675.726	It's like being a drunk toddler.
678.907	You become pathetic.
680.88	I remember just wanting
680.88	to lie down and quit.
684.999	It was a peculiar, peculiar feeling,
687.173	and a real surprise to me
687.173	to be debilitated to that degree.
692.412	And then we ran out of food completely,
700.352	that we'd laid on our outward journey.
702.217	We'd laid 10 depots of food,
703.56	literally burying food and fuel,
703.56	for our return journey —
706.277	the fuel was for a cooker so you
706.277	could melt snow to get water —
709.554	and I was forced to make the decision
709.554	to call for a resupply flight,
715.361	a ski plane carrying eight days of food
715.361	to tide us over that gap.
719.93	They took 12 hours to reach us
719.93	from the other side of Antarctica.
723.289	Calling for that plane was one of 
723.289	the toughest decisions of my life.
726.998	And I sound like a bit of a fraud
726.998	standing here now with a sort of belly.
730.474	I've put on 30 pounds
730.474	in the last three weeks.
733.314	Being that hungry has left
733.314	an interesting mental scar,
736.389	which is that I've been hoovering up
736.389	every hotel buffet that I can find.
740.996	(Laughter)
742.774	But we were genuinely quite hungry,
742.774	and in quite a bad way.
748.468	I don't regret calling
748.468	for that plane for a second,
750.909	because I'm still standing here alive,
752.911	with all digits intact, 
752.911	telling this story.
754.971	But getting external assistance like that
754.971	was never part of the plan,
759.709	and it's something my ego
759.709	is still struggling with.
762.913	This was the biggest dream I've ever had,
765.955	and it was so nearly perfect.
768.967	On the way back down to the coast,
770.648	our crampons — they're 
770.648	the spikes on our boots
772.839	that we have for traveling
772.839	over this blue ice on the glacier —
775.765	broke on the top of the Beardmore.
777.42	We still had 100 miles to go downhill
779.185	on very slippery rock-hard blue ice.
781.419	They needed repairing almost every hour.
783.81	To give you an idea of scale,
785.761	this is looking down towards the mouth
785.761	of the Beardmore Glacier.
788.758	You could fit the entirety of Manhattan
788.758	in the gap on the horizon.
792.233	That's 20 miles between
792.233	Mount Hope and Mount Kiffin.
795.447	I've never felt as small 
795.447	as I did in Antarctica.
801.68	When we got down
801.68	to the mouth of the glacier,
803.785	we found fresh snow had obscured
803.785	the dozens of deep crevasses.
808.431	One of Shackleton's men described
808.431	crossing this sort of terrain
811.381	as like walking over the glass roof
811.381	of a railway station.
816.375	We fell through more times
816.375	than I can remember,
819.289	usually just putting a ski
819.289	or a boot through the snow.
822.721	Occasionally we went in all 
822.721	the way up to our armpits,
825.324	but thankfully never deeper than that.
828.767	And less than five weeks ago,
828.767	after 105 days,
832.947	we crossed this oddly 
832.947	inauspicious finish line,
836.522	the coast of Ross Island 
836.522	on the New Zealand side of Antarctica.
839.544	You can see the ice in the foreground
841.694	and the sort of rubbly rock behind that.
844.556	Behind us lay an unbroken 
844.556	ski trail of nearly 1,800 miles.
848.358	We'd made the longest ever
848.358	polar journey on foot,
850.866	something I'd been dreaming 
850.866	of doing for a decade.
855.256	And looking back,
857.271	I still stand by all the things
859.666	I've been saying for years
861.248	about the importance of goals
863.367	and determination and self-belief,
866.809	but I'll also admit that I hadn't given
866.809	much thought to what happens
871.52	when you reach the all-consuming goal
875.432	that you've dedicated 
875.432	most of your adult life to,
878.75	and the reality is that I'm 
878.75	still figuring that bit out.
882.33	As I said, there are very few
882.33	superficial signs that I've been away.
885.931	I've put on 30 pounds.
887.382	I've got some very faint, probably 
887.382	covered in makeup now, frostbite scars.
890.91	I've got one on my nose, one on 
890.91	each cheek, from where the goggles are,
894.383	but inside I am a very 
894.383	different person indeed.
899.128	If I'm honest,
901.625	Antarctica challenged me
901.625	and humbled me so deeply
906.8	that I'm not sure I'll ever be able
906.8	to put it into words.
910.503	I'm still struggling to piece
910.503	together my thoughts.
914.603	That I'm standing here 
914.603	telling this story
918.248	is proof that we all can 
918.248	accomplish great things,
923.026	through ambition, through passion,
925.18	through sheer stubbornness,
927.342	by refusing to quit,
928.857	that if you dream something 
928.857	hard enough, as Sting said,
931.813	it does indeed come to pass.
934.884	But I'm also standing here 
934.884	saying, you know what,
938.23	that cliche about the journey being 
938.23	more important than the destination?
944.211	There's something in that.
947.532	The closer I got to my finish line,
949.901	that rubbly, rocky coast of Ross Island,
953.657	the more I started to realize
953.657	that the biggest lesson
956.851	that this very long, very hard walk
956.851	might be teaching me
961.431	is that happiness is not
961.431	a finish line,
965.124	that for us humans,
966.694	the perfection that so many of
966.694	us seem to dream of
970.17	might not ever be truly attainable,
974.25	and that if we can't feel content
974.25	here, today, now, on our journeys
982.716	amidst the mess and the striving
982.716	that we all inhabit,
987.184	the open loops, 
987.184	the half-finished to-do lists,
989.904	the could-do-better-next-times,
992.756	then we might never feel it.
996.055	A lot of people have asked me, what next?
999.631	Right now, I am very happy just recovering
999.631	and in front of hotel buffets.
1006.629	But as Bob Hope put it,
1010.982	I feel very humble,
1013.278	but I think I have the strength
1013.278	of character to fight it. (Laughter)
1017.347	Thank you.
1019.297	(Applause)
