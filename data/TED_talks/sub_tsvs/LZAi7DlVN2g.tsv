16.248	Today I have just one request.
19.243	Please don't tell me I'm normal.
22.633	Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
27.009	Remi is 22,
29.275	tall and very handsome.
32.239	He's speechless, but he communicates joy
36.167	in a way that some of the best orators cannot.
40.45	Remi knows what love is.
43.093	He shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless.
47.475	He's not greedy. He doesn't see skin color.
50.995	He doesn't care about religious differences, and get this:
54.316	He has never told a lie.
57.571	When he sings songs from our childhood,
60.052	attempting words that not even I could remember,
62.915	he reminds me of one thing:
65.139	how little we know about the mind, and how wonderful
67.692	the unknown must be.
71.267	Samuel is 16. He's tall. He's very handsome.
77.004	He has the most impeccable memory.
80.788	He has a selective one, though.
83.336	He doesn't remember if he stole my chocolate bar,
87.104	but he remembers the year of release for every song on my iPod,
90.394	conversations we had when he was four,
92.793	weeing on my arm on the first ever episode of Teletubbies,
96.264	and Lady Gaga's birthday.
99.672	Don't they sound incredible?
102.409	But most people don't agree.
105.433	And in fact, because their minds don't fit
108.169	into society's version of normal,
110.905	they're often bypassed and misunderstood.
113.843	But what lifted my heart and strengthened my soul
117.609	was that even though this was the case,
119.929	although they were not seen as ordinary,
122.843	this could only mean one thing:
125.355	that they were extraordinary --
128.73	autistic and extraordinary.
132.953	"Now, for you who may be less familiar with the term ""autism,"""
137.404	it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication,
141.306	learning and sometimes physical skills.
144.994	It manifests in each individual differently,
147.809	hence why Remi is so different from Sam.
150.49	And across the world, every 20 minutes, one new person
153.124	is diagnosed with autism, and although it's one of
155.994	the fastest-growing developmental disorders in the world,
159.137	there is no known cause or cure.
162.313	And I cannot remember the first moment I encountered autism,
165.578	but I cannot recall a day without it.
168.657	I was just three years old when my brother came along,
171.042	and I was so excited that
173.306	I had a new being in my life.
176.409	And after a few months went by,
179.138	I realized that he was different.
181.523	He screamed a lot.
183.729	He didn't want to play like the other babies did,
186.816	and in fact, he didn't seem
188.762	very interested in me whatsoever.
191.647	Remi lived and reigned in his own world, with his own rules,
195.627	and he found pleasure in the smallest things,
197.833	like lining up cars around the room
200.356	and staring at the washing machine
202.033	and eating anything that came in between.
205.415	And as he grew older, he grew more different,
209.16	and the differences became more obvious.
211.843	Yet beyond the tantrums and the frustration
215.295	and the never-ending hyperactivity
218.064	was something really unique:
220.656	a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world
224.624	without prejudice, a human who had never lied.
230.255	Extraordinary.
233.336	Now, I cannot deny that there have been
235.123	some challenging moments in my family,
237.855	moments where I've wished that they were just like me.
240.968	But I cast my mind back to the things that they've taught me
243.752	about individuality and communication and love,
247.592	and I realize that these are things that
250.929	I wouldn't want to change with normality.
255.327	Normality overlooks the beauty that differences give us,
260.48	and the fact that we are different doesn't mean that one of us is wrong.
263.809	It just means that there's a different kind of right.
267.647	And if I could communicate just one thing to Remi
271.464	and to Sam
273.79	and to you,
275.517	it would be that you don't have to be normal.
279.313	You can be extraordinary.
283.296	Because autistic or not,
285.377	the differences that we have --
287.587	We've got a gift! Everyone's got a gift inside of us,
291.955	and in all honesty, the pursuit of normality
295.419	is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
298.416	The chance for greatness, for progress and for change
302.756	dies the moment we try to be like someone else.
306.635	Please -- don't tell me I'm normal.
309.867	Thank you. (Applause)
312.34	(Applause)
