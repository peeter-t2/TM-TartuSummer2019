16.008	Sydney. I had been waiting my whole life to get to Sydney.
19.687	I got to the airport, to the hotel, checked in,
22.734	and, sitting there in the lobby, was a brochure
25.513	for the Sydney Festival. I thumbed through it,
28.135	"and I came across a show called ""Minto: Live."""
31.276	"The description read: ""The suburban streets of Minto"
34.908	become the stage for performances
37.449	created by international artists
39.655	"in collaboration with the people of Minto."""
42.455	What was this place called Minto?
45.17	Sydney, as I would learn, is a city of suburbs,
47.531	and Minto lies southwest, about an hour away.
51.204	I have to say, it wasn't exactly what I had in mind
54.563	for my first day down under.
56.16	I mean, I'd thought about the Harbour Bridge or Bondi Beach,
59.099	but Minto? But still, I'm a producer,
62.055	and the lure of a site-specific theater project
65.227	was more than I could resist. (Laughter)
67.496	So, off I went into Friday afternoon traffic,
69.98	and I'll never forget what I saw when I got there.
72.385	For the performance, the audience walked
75.039	around the neighborhood from house to house,
77.829	and the residents, who were the performers,
80.709	they came out of their houses, and they performed
82.82	these autobiographical dances on their lawns,
86.659	on their driveways. (Laughter)
89.007	The show is a collaboration with a U.K.-based
91.975	performance company called Lone Twin.
94.634	Lone Twin had come to Minto and worked
96.53	with the residents, and they had created these dances.
99.654	This Australian-Indian girl, she came out and started
103.492	to dance on her front lawn,
105.513	and her father peered out the window to see
108.451	what all the noise and commotion was about,
110.958	and he soon joined her.
113.166	And he was followed by her little sister.
116.293	And soon they were all dancing this joyous,
119.351	exuberant dance right there on their lawn. (Laughter)
123.526	And as I walked through the neighborhood,
125.718	I was amazed and I was moved by the incredible
129.939	sense of ownership this community clearly felt
132.376	about this event.
134.946	"""Minto: Live"" brought Sydneysiders into dialogue"
137.905	with international artists, and really celebrated
141.235	the diversity of Sydney on its own terms.
144.723	"The Sydney Festival which produced ""Minto: Live"" I think"
148.436	represents a new kind of 21st-century arts festival.
152.211	These festivals are radically open.
155.726	They can transform cities and communities.
159.438	To understand this, I think it kind of makes sense
162.118	to look where we've come from.
164.444	Modern arts festivals were born
166.467	in the rubble of World War II.
167.965	Civic leaders created these annual events
170.567	to celebrate culture as the highest
173.676	expression of the human spirit.
176.281	In 1947, the Edinburgh Festival was born
179.364	and Avignon was born and hundreds of others
182.021	would follow in their wake.
183.922	The work they did was very, very high art,
187.174	and stars came along like Laurie Anderson
189.778	and Merce Cunningham and Robert Lepage
192.053	who made work for this circuit,
193.473	"and you had these seminal shows like ""The Mahabharata"""
196.244	"and the monumental ""Einstein on the Beach."""
199.229	But as the decades passed,
201.724	these festivals, they really became the establishment,
204.925	and as the culture and capital accelerated,
208.318	the Internet brought us all together,
210.319	high and low kind of disappeared,
213.251	a new kind of festival emerged.
214.873	The old festivals, they continued to thrive, but
218.012	from Brighton to Rio to Perth, something new was emerging,
222.36	and these festivals were really different.
225.304	They're open, these festivals, because, like in Minto,
228.199	they understand that the dialogue
230.415	between the local and the global is essential.
234.133	They're open because they ask the audience to be a player,
238.636	a protagonist, a partner, rather than a passive spectator,
243.046	and they're open because they know that imagination
246.625	cannot be contained in buildings,
248.784	and so much of the work they do
250.637	is site-specific or outdoor work.
253.937	So, the new festival, it asks the audience to play
257.325	an essential role in shaping the performance.
260.443	Companies like De La Guarda, which I produce, and Punchdrunk
265.539	create these completely immersive experiences
268.353	that put the audience at the center of the action,
271.548	but the German performance company Rimini Protokoll
274.65	takes this all to a whole new level.
277.937	"In a series of shows that includes ""100 Percent Vancouver,"""
281.719	"""100 Percent Berlin,"" Rimini Protokoll makes shows"
285.716	that actually reflect society.
288.549	Rimini Protokoll chooses 100 people that represent that city
293.086	at that moment in terms of race and gender and class,
296.497	through a careful process that begins three months before,
299.771	and then those 100 people share stories about
302.998	themselves and their lives, and the whole thing
305.534	becomes a snapshot of that city at that moment.
310.156	LIFT has always been a pioneer in the use of venues.
313.591	They understand that theater and performance
316.002	can happen anywhere.
317.32	You can do a show in a schoolroom,
320.529	in an airport, — (Laughter) —
322.914	in a department store window.
325.399	Artists are explorers. Who better to show us the city anew?
329.821	Artists can take us to a far-flung part of the city
333.168	that we haven't explored, or they can take us into
335.196	that building that we pass every day but we never went into.
339.621	An artist, I think, can really show us people
343.784	that we might overlook in our lives.
346.923	Back to Back is an Australian company of people
350.318	with intellectual disabilities. I saw their amazing show
354.904	in New York at the Staten Island Ferry Terminal
358.073	at rush hour.
359.483	We, the audience, were given headsets and seated
362.203	on one side of the terminal.
364.987	The actors were right there in front of us,
366.979	right there among the commuters,
369.389	and we could hear them,
370.949	but we might not have otherwise seen them.
374.044	So Back to Back takes site-specific theater and uses it
378.562	to gently remind us about who and what we choose
381.836	to edit out of our daily lives.
384.727	So, the dialogue with the local and the global,
387.839	the audience as participant and player and protagonist,
391.749	the innovative use of site, all of these things
394.877	come to play in the amazing work
397.726	of the fantastic French company Royal de Luxe.
401.783	Royal de Luxe's giant puppets come into a city
405.523	and they live there for a few days.
408.276	"For ""The Sultan's Elephant,"" Royal de Luxe"
411.85	came to central London and brought it to a standstill
414.873	with their story of a giant little girl and her friend,
419.262	a time-traveling elephant.
421.774	For a few days, they transformed a massive city
426.443	into a community where endless possibility reigned.
431.346	"The Guardian wrote, ""If art is about transformation,"
434.937	then there can be no more transformative experience.
438.927	What 'The Sultan's Elephant' represents is no less
442.827	than an artistic occupation of the city
445.673	"and a reclamation of the streets for the people."""
450.55	We can talk about the economic impacts of these festivals
454.01	on their cities, but I'm much [more] interested in many more things,
458.316	like how a festival helps a city to express itself,
462.081	how it lets it come into its own.
465.352	Festivals promote diversity,
467.477	they bring neighbors into dialogue,
469.463	they increase creativity,
471.908	they offer opportunities for civic pride,
475.08	they improve our general psychological well-being.
478.739	In short, they make cities better places to live.
482.947	Case in point:
483.925	"When ""The Sultan's Elephant"" came to London"
487.269	just nine months after 7/7, a Londoner wrote,
491.625	"""For the first time since the London bombings,"
495.258	my daughter called up with that sparkle back in her voice.
498.868	She had gathered with others
500.61	to watch 'The Sultan's Elephant,' and, you know,
503.798	"it just made all the difference."""
506.481	Lyn Gardner in The Guardian has written
508.631	that a great festival can show us a map of the world,
513.094	a map of the city and a map of ourselves,
517.142	but there is no one fixed festival model.
520.348	I think what's so brilliant about the festivals,
523.184	the new festivals, is that they are really fully capturing
528.25	the complexity and the excitement
531.438	of the way we all live today.
533.463	Thank you very much. (Applause)
