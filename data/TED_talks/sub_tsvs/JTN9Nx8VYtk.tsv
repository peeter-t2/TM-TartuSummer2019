13.267	My name is Dan Cohen
13.267	and I am an academic, as he said.
16.5	And what that means is that I argue.
19.6	It's an important part of my life.
21.267	And I like to argue.
22.733	And I'm not just an academic,
22.733	I'm a philosopher,
26.133	so I like to think that I'm actually
26.133	pretty good at arguing.
29.1	But I also like to think
29.1	a lot about arguing.
32.367	And in thinking about arguing,
32.367	I've come across some puzzles.
35.867	And one of the puzzles is that,
37.8	as I've been thinking
37.8	about arguing over the years --
40.367	and it's been decades now --
41.8	I've gotten better at arguing.
43.5	But the more that I argue
43.5	and the better I get at arguing,
47.033	the more that I lose.
48.967	And that's a puzzle.
50.233	And the other puzzle
50.233	is that I'm actually okay with that.
53.5	Why is it that I'm okay with losing
55.367	and why is it that I think good arguers
55.367	are actually better at losing?
58.833	Well, there are some other puzzles.
60.867	One is: why do we argue?
62.767	Who benefits from arguments?
64.433	When I think about arguments,
64.433	I'm talking about --
66.8	let's call them academic arguments
66.8	or cognitive arguments --
69.667	where something cognitive is at stake:
71.533	Is this proposition true?
71.533	Is this theory a good theory?
74.3	Is this a viable interpretation
74.3	of the data or the text? And so on.
78.8	I'm not interested really in arguments
78.8	about whose turn it is to do the dishes
82.8	or who has to take out the garbage.
84.5	Yeah, we have those arguments, too.
86.833	I tend to win those arguments,
86.833	because I know the tricks.
89.6	But those aren't the important arguments.
91.6	I'm interested in academic arguments,
93.4	and here are the things that puzzle me.
96.667	First, what do good arguers win
96.667	when they win an argument?
99.767	What do I win if I convince you
102.267	that utilitarianism isn't really
102.267	the right framework
104.72	for thinking about ethical theories?
106.5	What do we win when we win an argument?
108.4	Even before that,
109.767	what does it matter to me
111.033	whether you have this idea
111.033	that Kant's theory works
114	or Mill is the right ethicist to follow?
117.2	It's no skin off my back
118.6	whether you think functionalism
118.6	is a viable theory of mind.
122.3	So why do we even try to argue?
124.367	Why do we try to convince other people
126.233	to believe things
126.233	they don't want to believe,
128.433	and is that even a nice thing to do?
130.233	Is that a nice way to treat
130.233	another human being,
132.5	try and make them think something
132.5	they don't want to think?
135.5	Well, my answer is going to make reference
135.5	to three models for arguments.
140.199	The first model -- let's call it
140.199	the dialectical model --
142.967	is we think of arguments as war;
142.967	you know what that's like --
145.9	a lot of screaming and shouting
145.9	and winning and losing.
148.633	That's not a very helpful
148.633	model for arguing,
150.8	but it's a pretty common
150.8	and entrenched model for arguing.
153.567	But there's a second model for arguing:
153.567	arguments as proofs.
156.833	Think of a mathematician's argument.
158.933	Here's my argument.
158.933	Does it work? Is it any good?
161.733	Are the premises warranted?
161.733	Are the inferences valid?
166.233	Does the conclusion follow
166.233	from the premises?
168.8	No opposition, no adversariality --
171.233	not necessarily any arguing
171.233	in the adversarial sense.
176.933	But there's a third model to keep in mind
178.933	that I think is going to be very helpful,
180.933	and that is arguments as performances,
180.933	arguments in front of an audience.
185.967	We can think of a politician
185.967	trying to present a position,
188.933	trying to convince
188.933	the audience of something.
191.1	But there's another twist on this model
191.1	that I really think is important;
194.6	namely, that when we argue
194.6	before an audience,
198.633	sometimes the audience has
198.633	a more participatory role in the argument;
202.733	that is, arguments are also
202.733	[performances] in front of juries,
207.267	who make a judgment and decide the case.
210.067	Let's call this the rhetorical model,
211.9	where you have to tailor your argument
211.9	to the audience at hand.
215.633	You know, presenting a sound, well-argued,
218.3	tight argument in English
218.3	before a francophone audience
221.7	just isn't going to work.
223.8	So we have these models --
223.8	argument as war, argument as proof
227.467	and argument as performance.
230.167	Of those three, the argument as war
230.167	is the dominant one.
234.467	It dominates how we talk about arguments,
237.1	it dominates how we think about arguments,
239.167	and because of that,
239.167	it shapes how we argue,
242.167	our actual conduct in arguments.
243.967	Now, when we talk about arguments,
245.667	we talk in a very militaristic language.
247.667	We want strong arguments,
247.667	arguments that have a lot of punch,
250.933	arguments that are right on target.
252.633	We want to have our defenses up
252.633	and our strategies all in order.
255.833	We want killer arguments.
258.433	That's the kind of argument we want.
261.2	It is the dominant way
261.2	of thinking about arguments.
263.633	When I'm talking about arguments,
265.267	that's probably what you thought of,
265.267	the adversarial model.
268.445	But the war metaphor,
270.966	the war paradigm or model
270.966	for thinking about arguments,
273.733	has, I think, deforming effects
273.733	on how we argue.
277.1	First, it elevates tactics over substance.
280.967	You can take a class
280.967	in logic, argumentation.
283.133	You learn all about the subterfuges
284.867	that people use to try and win
284.867	arguments -- the false steps.
287.767	It magnifies the us-versus
287.767	them aspect of it.
290.967	It makes it adversarial; it's polarizing.
294.4	And the only foreseeable outcomes
294.4	are triumph -- glorious triumph --
300.233	or abject, ignominious defeat.
303.333	I think those are deforming effects,
305.1	and worst of all, it seems
305.1	to prevent things like negotiation
308.967	or deliberation or compromise
308.967	or collaboration.
314.233	Think about that one -- have you
314.233	ever entered an argument thinking,
317.424	"""Let's see if we can hash something out,"
317.424	rather than fight it out.
320.833	"What can we work out together?"""
322.767	I think the argument-as-war metaphor
325.163	inhibits those other kinds
325.163	of resolutions to argumentation.
329.6	And finally -- this is really
329.6	the worst thing --
332.067	arguments don't seem to get us
332.067	anywhere; they're dead ends.
334.9	They are like roundabouts or traffic jams
334.9	or gridlock in conversation.
340.6	We don't get anywhere.
342.433	And one more thing.
343.733	And as an educator, this is the one
343.733	that really bothers me:
346.667	If argument is war,
348.867	then there's an implicit equation
348.867	of learning with losing.
353.9	And let me explain what I mean.
356.067	Suppose you and I have an argument.
358.633	You believe a proposition, P, and I don't.
362.5	"And I say, ""Well, why do you believe P?"""
364.438	And you give me your reasons.
365.867	And I object and say,
365.867	"""Well, what about ...?"""
368.267	And you answer my objection.
369.8	And I have a question:
369.8	"""Well, what do you mean?"
372.233	"How does it apply over here?"""
374.133	And you answer my question.
375.8	Now, suppose at the end of the day,
377.533	I've objected, I've questioned,
379.667	I've raised all sorts of counter
379.667	counter-considerations
382.287	and in every case you've responded
382.287	to my satisfaction.
385.9	And so at the end of the day, I say,
388.567	"""You know what? I guess you're right: P."""
392.5	So, I have a new belief.
394.867	And it's not just any belief;
396.304	it's well-articulated, examined --
396.304	it's a battle-tested belief.
403.8	Great cognitive gain.
404.984	OK, who won that argument?
407.6	Well, the war metaphor
407.6	seems to force us into saying you won,
411.567	even though I'm the only one
411.567	who made any cognitive gain.
414.3	What did you gain, cognitively,
414.3	from convincing me?
417.967	Sure, you got some pleasure out of it,
417.967	maybe your ego stroked,
420.967	maybe you get some professional status
422.967	in the field --
422.967	"""This guy's a good arguer."""
425.567	But just from a cognitive point of view,
428.567	who was the winner?
429.867	The war metaphor forces us into thinking
429.867	that you're the winner and I lost,
434.7	even though I gained.
436.767	And there's something wrong
436.767	with that picture.
439.067	And that's the picture
439.067	I really want to change if we can.
441.8	So, how can we find ways
445.173	to make arguments
445.173	yield something positive?
449.633	What we need is new
449.633	exit strategies for arguments.
453.367	But we're not going to have
453.367	new exit strategies for arguments
456.267	until we have new entry
456.267	approaches to arguments.
459.6	We need to think
459.6	of new kinds of arguments.
463.267	In order to do that, well --
465.867	I don't know how to do that.
468.1	That's the bad news.
469.467	The argument-as-war metaphor
469.467	is just ... it's a monster.
472.5	It's just taken up habitation in our mind,
474.919	and there's no magic bullet
474.919	that's going to kill it.
477.39	There's no magic wand
477.39	that's going to make it disappear.
480.049	I don't have an answer.
481.333	But I have some suggestions.
482.7	Here's my suggestion:
485.7	If we want to think
485.7	of new kinds of arguments,
487.908	what we need to do
487.908	is think of new kinds of arguers.
491.9	So try this:
494.767	Think of all the roles
494.767	that people play in arguments.
499.233	There's the proponent and the opponent
502.233	in an adversarial, dialectical argument.
504.433	There's the audience
504.433	in rhetorical arguments.
506.6	There's the reasoner
506.6	in arguments as proofs.
510.767	All these different roles.
512.1	Now, can you imagine an argument
512.1	in which you are the arguer,
515.967	but you're also in the audience,
515.967	watching yourself argue?
519.967	Can you imagine yourself
519.967	watching yourself argue,
523.033	losing the argument, and yet still,
523.033	at the end of the argument, saying,
527.533	"""Wow, that was a good argument!"""
531.133	Can you do that?
532.5	I think you can, and I think
532.5	if you can imagine that kind of argument,
535.832	where the loser says to the winner
535.832	and the audience and the jury can say,
539.633	"""Yeah, that was a good argument,"""
541.6	then you have imagined a good argument.
543.482	And more than that,
544.667	I think you've imagined a good arguer,
546.667	an arguer that's worthy of the kind
546.667	of arguer you should try to be.
551.567	Now, I lose a lot of arguments.
554.367	It takes practice to become a good arguer,
556.8	in the sense of being able to benefit
556.8	from losing, but fortunately,
559.98	I've had many, many colleagues
559.98	who have been willing to step up
562.967	and provide that practice for me.
564.7	Thank you.
565.899	(Applause)
