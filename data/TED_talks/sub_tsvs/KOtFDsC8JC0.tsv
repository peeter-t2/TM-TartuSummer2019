12.96	A girl I've never met before
15.84	changed my life and the life
15.84	of thousands of other people.
19.76	I'm the CEO of DoSomething.org.
22.56	It's one of the largest organizations
22.56	in the world for young people.
27	In fact it's bigger than the Boy Scouts
27	in the United States.
29.92	And we're not homophobic.
31.48	(Laughter)
34.08	And it's true -- the way we communicate
34.08	with young people is by text,
37.64	because that's how
37.64	young people communicate.
40.48	So we'll run over 200 campaigns this year,
44.08	things like collecting peanut butter
44.08	for food pantries,
47.8	or making Valentine's Day cards
47.8	for senior citizens who are homebound.
53	And we'll text them.
54.48	And we'll have a 97 percent open rate.
57.44	It'll over-index Hispanic and urban.
60.16	We collected 200,000 jars of peanut butter
64.16	and over 365,000 Valentine's Day cards.
68.56	This is big scale. OK --
70.36	(Applause)
73.64	But there's one weird side effect.
75.84	Every time we send out a text message,
78.96	we get back a few dozen text messages
78.96	having nothing to do with peanut butter
83.28	or hunger or senior citizens --
86.08	but text messages about being bullied,
89.6	text messages about being addicted to pot.
93.52	And the worst message
93.52	we ever got said exactly this:
98.32	"""He won't stop raping me."
100.72	It's my dad.
103.04	He told me not to tell anyone.
103.04	"Are you there?"""
110.238	We couldn't believe this was happening.
112.12	We couldn't believe that something
112.12	so horrific could happen to a human being,
115.8	and that she would share it with us --
115.8	something so intimate, so personal.
120.48	And we realized
120.48	we had to stop triaging this
122.76	and we had to build a crisis text line
122.76	for these people in pain.
127.96	So we launched Crisis Text Line,
131	very quietly, in Chicago and El Paso --
131	just a few thousand people in each market.
136.48	And in four months,
136.48	we were in all 295 area codes in America.
141.24	Just to put that into perspective,
142.883	that's zero marketing and faster growth
142.883	than when Facebook first launched.
146.52	(Applause)
151.08	Text is unbelievably private.
153.48	No one hears you talking.
155.2	So we spike everyday at lunch time --
157.32	kids are sitting at the lunch table
159.04	and you think that she's texting
159.04	the cute boy across the hall,
162.24	but she's actually texting us
162.24	about her bulimia.
165.28	"And we don't get the word ""like"""
165.28	"or ""um"" or hyperventilating or crying."
169.08	We just get facts.
172.2	"We get things like, ""I want to die."
175.84	I have a bottle of pills
175.84	"on the desk in front of me."""
179.2	And so the crisis counselor says,
181.32	"""How about you put those pills"
181.32	"in the drawer while we text?"""
185.84	And they go back and forth for a while.
188.16	And the crisis counselor
188.16	gets the girl to give her her address,
191.2	because if you're texting
191.2	a text line, you want help.
193.92	So she gets the address
195.12	and the counselor triggers
195.12	an active rescue
197.32	while they're texting back and forth.
200	And then it goes quiet --
	from this girl.
209.16	And the next message that comes in says --
211.64	it's the mom --
213.28	"""I had no idea, and I was in the house,"
216.88	we're in an ambulance
216.88	"on our way to the hospital."""
220.2	As a mom that one just --
224.76	The next message comes a month later.
227.28	"""I just got out of the hospital."
229	I was diagnosed as bipolar,
229	"and I think I'm going to be OK."""
233.44	(Applause)
236.16	I would love to tell you
236.16	that that's an unusual exchange,
240.84	but we're doing on average
240.84	2.41 active rescues a day.
245.4	Thirty percent of our text messages
245.4	are about suicide and depression -- huge.
250.76	The beautiful thing about Crisis Text Line
252.96	is that these are strangers
252.96	counseling other strangers
256.56	on the most intimate issues,
259.24	and getting them from hot moments
259.24	to cold moments.
261.64	It's exciting, and I will tell you
263.96	that we have done a total
263.96	of more than 6.5 million text messages
268.24	in less than two years.
269.56	(Applause)
274.56	But the thing that really gets me
274.56	hot and sweaty about this,
277.8	the thing that really gets me
277.8	psyched is the data:
280.68	6.5 million messages --
283.04	that's the volume, velocity and variety
283.04	to provide a really juicy corpus.
289	We can do things like predictive work.
290.88	We can do all kinds of conclusions
290.88	and learnings from that data set.
295.44	So we can be better,
295.44	and the world can be better.
298.68	So how do we use the data
298.68	to make us better?
301.12	Alright, chances are someone here,
301.12	someone watching this
304.48	has seen a therapist or a shrink
304.48	at some point in time in your life --
308.08	you do not have to raise your hand.
309.771	(Laughter)
311.4	How do you know that person's any good?
313.68	Oh, they have a degree
313.68	from Harvard on the wall?
315.96	Are you sure he didn't graduate
315.96	in the bottom 10 percent?
318.651	(Laughter)
320.08	When my husband and I
320.08	saw a marriage counselor,
322.32	I thought she was a genius when she said,
324.297	"""I'll see you guys in two weeks --"
324.297	"but I need to see you next week, sir."""
327.76	(Laughter)
330.44	We have the data to know
330.44	what makes a great counselor.
333.76	We know that if you text
333.76	"the words ""numbs"" and ""sleeve,"""
338.68	there's a 99 percent match for cutting.
341.84	We know that if you text
341.84	"in the words ""mg"" and ""rubber band,"""
346.68	there's a 99 percent match
346.68	for substance abuse.
350.76	And we know that if you text in
350.76	"""sex,"" ""oral"" and ""Mormon,"""
356.12	you're questioning if you're gay.
359.44	Now that's interesting information
359.44	that a counselor could figure out
362.68	but that algorithm in our hands
362.68	means that an automatic pop-up says,
366.84	"""99 percent match for cutting --"
366.84	"try asking one of these questions"""
371.24	to prompt the counselor.
372.6	"Or ""99 percent match for substance abuse,"
375.4	here are three drug clinics
375.4	"near the texter."""
379.56	It makes us more accurate.
382.24	On the day that Robin Williams
382.24	committed suicide,
385	people flooded hotlines
385	all over this country.
387.28	It was sad to see an icon,
387.28	a funnyman, commit suicide,
391.56	and there were three hour wait times
391.56	on every phone hotline in the country.
395.28	We had a spike in volume also.
397.64	The difference was
398.92	"if you text us, ""I want to die,"""
398.92	"or ""I want to kill myself,"""
402.88	the algorithm reads that,
402.88	you're code orange,
406.36	and you become number one in the queue.
408.56	So we can handle severity,
408.56	not chronological.
411.68	(Applause)
416.84	This data is also making the world better
419.2	because I'm sitting on the world's
419.2	first map of real-time crises.
424.72	Think about it:
425.96	those 6.5 million messages, auto-tagging
425.96	through natural language processes,
430.36	all of these data points --
431.88	I can tell you that the worst day
431.88	of the week for eating disorders: Monday.
437.88	The worst time of day
437.88	for substance abuse: 5am.
442.88	And that Montana is
442.88	a beautiful place to visit
445.36	but you do not want to live there,
447.16	because it is the number one state
447.16	for suicidal ideation.
451.92	And we've made this data public
451.92	and free and open.
455.84	We've pulled all the personally
455.84	identifiable information.
458.96	And it's in a place
458.96	called CrisisTrends.org.
462.24	Because I want schools to be able to see
467.6	that Monday is the worst day
467.6	for eating disorders,
469.96	so that they can plan meals
471.84	and guidance counselors
471.84	to be there on Mondays.
474.28	And I want families to see that
474.28	substance abuse questions spike at 5am.
479.04	I want somebody to take care of those
479.04	Native American reservations in Montana.
483.96	(Applause)
486.04	Data, evidence
488.96	makes policy, research,
491.08	journalism, policing, school boards --
491.08	everything better.
495.28	I don't think of myself
495.28	as a mental health activist.
498.68	I think of myself
498.68	as a national health activist.
502.84	I get really excited about this data,
502.84	I'm a little nerdy.
506.48	Yeah, that sounded too girly.
508.16	I'm nerdy.
509.6	(Laughter)
511.12	I love data.
514.12	And the only difference really between me
514.12	and those people in hoodies down the road
519.84	with their fat-funded companies,
521.88	is that I'm not inspired by helping you
521.88	find Chinese food at 2am in Dallas,
527.72	or helping you touch your wrist
527.72	and get a car immediately,
531.76	or swipe right and get laid.
533.64	I'm inspired --
535.039	(Laughter, applause)
540.84	I want to use tech and data
540.84	to make the world a better place.
545.44	I want to use it to help that girl,
547.16	who texted in about 
547.16	being raped by her father.
549.8	Because the truth is
549.8	we never heard from her again.
552.32	And I hope that she is
552.32	somewhere safe and healthy,
557.04	and I hope that she sees this talk
559.32	and she knows that her desperation
561.96	and her courage inspired
561.96	the creation of Crisis Text Line
565.92	and inspires me every freaking day.
568.76	(Applause)
