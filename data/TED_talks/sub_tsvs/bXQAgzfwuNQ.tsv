18.798	How many of you have seen
18.798	"the Alfred Hitchcock film ""The Birds""?"
22.171	Any of you get really freaked out by that?
24.868	You might want to leave now.
26.275	(Laughter)
27.33	So this is a vending machine for crows.
29.357	Over the past few days,
29.357	many of you have been asking,
31.874	"""How did you come to this?"
31.874	"How did you get started doing this?"""
34.888	It started, as with many great ideas,
36.681	or many ideas you can't
36.681	get rid of, anyway,
38.741	at a cocktail party.
39.92	About 10 years ago, I was at a cocktail
39.92	party with a friend of mine.
43.154	We were sitting there,
43.154	and he was complaining about the crows
46.067	that were all over his yard
46.067	and making a big mess.
48.462	And he was telling me
48.462	we ought to eradicate these things,
51.188	kill them, because they're making a mess.
53.184	I said that was stupid,
54.359	maybe we should just train them
54.359	to do something useful.
56.956	And he said that was impossible.
58.511	And I'm sure I'm in good company
58.511	in finding that tremendously annoying,
61.907	when someone tells you it's impossible.
63.811	So I spent the next 10 years reading
63.811	about crows in my spare time.
66.965	(Laughter)
69.765	And after 10 years of this, my wife said,
71.986	"""You've got to do this thing"
71.986	you've been talking about,
74.63	"and build the vending machine."""
76.149	So I did.
77.324	But part of the reason
77.324	I found this interesting is,
79.793	I started noticing that we're very
79.793	aware of all the species
82.649	that are going extinct on the planet
84.468	as a result of human habitation expansion,
86.561	and no one seems to be paying
86.561	attention to all the species
89.53	that are actually living;
89.53	they're surviving.
91.622	And I'm talking specifically
91.622	about synanthropic species,
94.371	which have adapted
94.371	specifically for human ecologies,
97.073	species like rats
97.073	and cockroaches and crows.
100.46	And as I started looking at them,
100.46	I was finding that they had hyper-adapted.
104.098	They'd become extremely
104.098	adept at living with us.
106.514	And in return, we just tried
106.514	to kill them all the time.
109.211	(Laughter)
110.33	And in doing so, we were
110.33	breeding them for parasitism.
112.927	We were giving them all sorts
112.927	of reasons to adapt new ways.
116.912	So, for example, rats
116.912	are incredibly responsive breeders.
119.694	And cockroaches, as anyone who's tried
119.694	to get rid of them knows,
122.737	have become really immune
122.737	to the poisons that we're using.
125.763	So I thought, let's build something
125.763	that's mutually beneficial;
129.421	something that we can both benefit from,
131.425	and find some way to make
131.425	a new relationship with these species.
134.468	So I built the vending machine.
136.134	But the story of the vending machine
136.134	is a little more interesting
139.228	if you know more about crows.
140.639	It turns out, crows aren't just
140.639	surviving with human beings;
143.505	they're actually thriving.
144.77	They're found everywhere
144.77	on the planet except for the Arctic
147.631	and the southern tip of South America.
149.467	And in all that area,
149.467	they're only rarely found breeding
152.182	more than five kilometers
152.182	away from human beings.
154.525	So we may not think about them,
154.525	but they're always around.
157.299	And not surprisingly,
157.299	given the human population growth,
159.967	more than half of the human population
159.967	is living in cities now.
162.967	And out of those, nine-tenths
162.967	of the human growth population
165.806	is occurring in cities.
166.988	We're seeing a population boom with crows.
169.185	So bird counts are indicating
171.254	that we might be seeing up to exponential
171.254	growth in their numbers.
174.426	So that's no great surprise.
176.097	But what was really interesting
176.097	to me was to find out
178.614	that the birds were adapting
178.614	in a pretty unusual way.
182.611	And I'll give you an example of that.
185.17	This is Betty.
185.17	She's a New Caledonian crow.
187.464	And these crows use sticks in the wild
189.894	to get insects and whatnot
189.894	out of pieces of wood.
192.552	Here, she's trying to get
192.552	a piece of meat out of a tube.
195.242	But the researchers had a problem.
196.909	They messed up and left
196.909	just a stick of wire in there.
199.481	And she hadn't had the opportunity
199.481	to do this before.
202.028	You see, it wasn't working very well.
204.52	So she adapted.
207.117	Now, this is completely unprompted;
207.117	she had never seen this done before.
210.544	No one taught her to bend this into a hook
212.58	or had shown her how it could happen.
214.385	But she did it all on her own.
215.862	So keep in mind --
215.862	she's never seen this done.
218.347	(Laughter)
219.962	Right.
221.169	(Laughter)
227.828	Yeah. All right.
229.276	(Applause)
233.945	So that's the part where
233.945	the researchers freak out.
236.45	(Laughter)
238.243	It turns out,
239.434	we've been finding more and more
239.434	that crows are really intelligent.
242.698	Their brains are in the same proportion
242.698	as chimpanzee brains are.
246.954	There's all kinds of anecdotes
248.42	for the different kinds
248.42	of intelligence they have.
250.806	For example, in Sweden,
250.806	crows will wait for fishermen
253.33	to drop lines through holes in the ice.
255.247	And when the fishermen move off,
256.811	the crows fly down, reel up the lines,
256.811	and eat the fish or the bait.
260.076	It's pretty annoying for the fishermen.
262.038	On an entirely different tack,
263.501	at University of Washington
263.501	a few years ago,
266.115	they were doing an experiment where
266.115	they captured some crows on campus.
269.499	Some students went out,
269.499	netted some crows, brought them in,
272.341	weighed and measured them,
272.341	and let them back out again.
274.949	And they were entertained to discover
274.949	that for the rest of the week,
278.185	whenever these particular students
278.185	walked around campus,
280.841	these crows would caw at them
280.841	and run around,
282.976	and make their life kind of miserable.
284.812	(Laughter)
285.838	They were significantly less entertained
287.807	when this went on for the next week.
289.56	And the next month.
290.857	And after summer break.
292.609	Until they finally graduated
292.609	and left campus,
294.932	and -- glad to get away, I'm sure --
296.696	came back sometime later, and found
296.696	the crows still remembered them.
299.959	(Laughter)
300.989	So, the moral being: don't piss off crows.
303.088	So now, students
303.088	at the University of Washington
306.331	that are studying these crows,
306.331	do so with a giant wig and a big mask.
309.727	(Laughter)
311.966	It's fairly interesting.
313.3	(Laughter)
314.895	So we know these crows are really smart,
316.843	but the more I dug into this,
316.843	the more I found
319.047	that they actually have
319.047	an even more significant adaptation.
323.276	Video: Crows have become
323.276	highly skilled at making a living
326.714	in these new urban environments.
329.085	In this Japanese city, they have devised
329.085	a way of eating a food
333.02	that normally they can't manage:
337.623	drop it among the traffic.
343.633	The problem now is collecting the bits,
343.633	without getting run over.
348.798	Wait for the light to stop the traffic.
362.939	Then, collect your cracked nut in safety.
370.032	(Laughter)
371.33	(Applause)
372.433	Joshua Klein: Yeah, pretty interesting.
374.45	What's significant about this
374.45	isn't that crows are using cars
377.411	to crack nuts.
378.586	In fact, that's old hat for crows.
380.251	This happened about 10 years ago
381.81	in a place called Sendai City,
381.81	at a driving school
384.361	in the suburbs of Tokyo.
386.067	And since that time,
387.246	all the crows in the neighborhood
387.246	are picking up this behavior.
390.332	Now every crow within five kilometers
390.332	is standing by a sidewalk,
393.383	waiting to collect its lunch.
395.321	So they're learning from each other.
395.321	And research bears this out.
398.415	Parents seem to be teaching their young.
400.953	They learn from their peers,
400.953	they learn from their enemies.
403.827	If I have a little extra time,
405.306	I'll tell you about a case
405.306	of crow infidelity
407.477	that illustrates that nicely.
409.342	The point being, they've developed
409.342	cultural adaptation.
412.034	And as we heard yesterday,
413.303	that's the Pandora's box
413.303	that's getting human beings in trouble,
416.369	and we're starting to see it with them.
418.266	They're able to very quickly
418.266	and very flexibly adapt
420.826	to new challenges and new resources
420.826	in their environment,
423.578	which is really useful
423.578	if you live in a city.
427.011	So we know that there's lots of crows.
429.117	We found out they're really smart
429.117	and they can teach each other.
432.202	When all this became clear,
433.527	I realized the only obvious thing to do
433.527	is build a vending machine.
436.714	So that's what we did.
437.891	This is a vending machine for crows.
439.652	And it uses Skinnerian training
439.652	to shape their behavior over four stages.
443.343	It's pretty simple.
444.724	Basically, what happens
444.724	is that we put this out in a field
447.752	or someplace where there's lots of crows.
449.746	We put coins and peanuts
449.746	all around the base of the machine.
452.607	Crows eventually come by, eat the peanuts,
454.672	and get used to the machine being there.
456.63	Eventually, they eat all the peanuts.
458.435	Then they see peanuts
458.435	here on the feeder tray,
460.778	and hop up and help themselves.
462.524	Then they leave, the machine
462.524	spits up more coins and peanuts,
465.421	and life is dandy if you're a crow --
467.215	you can come back anytime
467.215	and get yourself a peanut.
469.685	So when they get really used to that,
469.685	we move on to the crows coming back.
473.194	Now they're used to the sound
473.194	of the machine;
475.321	they keep coming back
475.321	and digging out peanuts
477.457	from the pile of coins that's there.
479.204	When they get really happy
479.204	about this, we stymie them.
481.764	We move to the third stage,
481.764	where we only give them a coin.
484.582	Now, like most of us who have gotten
484.582	used to a good thing,
487.344	this really pisses them off.
488.707	So they do what they do in nature
488.707	when they're looking for something:
492.011	sweep things out of the way
492.011	with their beak.
494.108	They do that here, and that knocks
494.108	the coins down the slot.
496.974	When that happens, they get a peanut.
498.784	This goes on for some time.
500.103	The crows learn that
500.103	all they have to do is show up,
502.563	wait for the coin to come out,
502.563	put it in the slot,
504.937	then get their peanut.
506.112	When they're good
506.112	and comfortable with that,
508.215	we move to the final stage,
508.215	where they show up and nothing happens.
511.41	This is where we see the difference
511.41	between crows and other animals.
514.641	Squirrels, for example, would show up,
514.641	look for the peanut, go away.
518.377	Come back, look for the peanut, go away.
520.955	They do this maybe half a dozen times
520.955	before they get bored,
523.817	and then they go off and play in traffic.
525.818	Crows, on the other hand,
525.818	show up and they try and figure it out.
529.49	They know this machine
529.49	has been messing with them
531.819	through three different
531.819	stages of behavior.
533.865	(Laughter)
534.891	They figure there must be more to it.
536.694	So they poke at it and peck at it.
538.527	And eventually some crow
538.527	gets a bright idea:
540.705	"""Hey, there's lots of coins"
540.705	lying around from the first stage,
544.65	hops down, picks it up, drops it
544.65	in the slot, and we're off to the races.
548.839	That crow enjoys a temporary
548.839	monopoly on peanuts,
551.283	until his friends figure out
551.283	how to do it, and then there we go.
554.95	So, what's significant about this to me
557.33	isn't that we can train crows
557.33	to pick up peanuts.
559.688	Mind you, there's 216 million
559.688	dollars' worth of change lost every year,
563.542	but I'm not sure I can depend
563.542	on that ROI from crows.
566.221	(Laughter)
567.292	Instead, I think we should look
567.292	a little bit larger.
570.5	I think crows can be trained
570.5	to do other things.
572.79	For example, why not train them
572.79	to pick up garbage after stadium events?
576.29	Or find expensive components
576.29	from discarded electronics?
579.218	Or maybe do search and rescue?
581.679	The main point of all this for me is,
584.33	we can find mutually beneficial
584.33	systems for these species.
587.083	We can find ways to interact
587.083	with these other species
589.611	that doesn't involve exterminating them,
591.569	but involves finding an equilibrium
591.569	with them that's a useful balance.
594.895	Thanks very much.
596.174	(Applause)
