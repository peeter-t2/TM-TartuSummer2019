12.916	It was the end of October
12.916	in the mountains in Austria.
17.262	I was there on a field trip
17.262	with my architecture students from Zurich.
21.48	And when we reached a high valley,
25.619	I surprised them with the news
25.619	that there was no hut
28.112	or hotel booked for the night.
31.372	It was not a mistake.
33.063	It was totally on purpose.
36.913	The challenge was to build our own shelter
36.913	with whatever we could find.
42.482	And we all survived.
43.898	It was cold, it was really tough ...
46.842	and it was a great learning experience
49.549	to discover that there are a lot
49.549	of resources given by nature for free,
53.383	and all that we need
53.383	is our sensitivity to see them ...
58.03	and our creativity to use them.
62.15	I found myself in a similar situation.
66.245	When I was an architecture student
66.245	about 13 years ago,
70.77	I went to Bangladesh
70.77	to a remote village called Rudrapur
74.083	with the aim to design and build
74.083	a school as my thesis project.
78.008	I had lived in that village before
78.008	when I was 19 and a volunteer
81.227	at Dipshikha, a Bangladeshi NGO
81.227	for rural development.
84.188	And what I had learned from them
85.894	was that the most sustainable strategy
85.894	for sustainable development
90.696	is to cherish and to use
90.696	your very own resources and potential,
95.879	and not get dependent on external factors.
99.332	And this is what I tried to do
99.332	with my architecture as well.
103.179	In terms of suitable building
103.179	materials for my school,
106.584	I didn't have to look far.
108.538	They were right under my feet:
111.552	mud, earth, dirt, clay,
111.552	however you call it ...
116.608	and bamboo that was growing all around.
121.22	Electricity in remote Bangladesh is rare,
125.379	but we didn't need it.
126.609	We had human energy
128.232	and the people were happy
128.232	to have the work.
132.008	Tools were an issue, too,
133.971	but we had these guys,
135.558	water buffalos.
138.55	We had also tried a bit cows,
140.71	but interestingly,
140.71	they were too intelligent.
143.83	They were always stepping
143.83	in the holes of the previous round.
146.75	They wouldn't mix the mud, the straw --
148.632	(Laughter)
149.706	the sand, which are
149.706	the ingredients in the walls.
153.991	And except a small team of consultants
156.389	like my partner
156.389	for realization, Eike Roswag,
158.516	and my basket-weaver cousin, Emmanuel,
161.158	it was all built by craftsmen
161.158	from the village.
167.433	And this is the METI school
167.433	after six months of construction.
170.741	(Applause)
173.108	Thank you.
174.291	(Applause)
175.917	Load-bearing earth walls
175.917	that really ground the school,
180.046	and large bamboo structures
180.046	that bring the lightness in.
185.455	That's the classroom on the ground floor.
188.892	Attached to it are the caves.
191.583	They're for reading,
191.583	for snuggling, for solo work,
194.021	for meditation, for playing ...
196.711	and the classroom on the top.
201.651	The children all signed
201.651	with their names in Bengali the doors,
205.458	and they did not only sign,
205.458	they also helped building the school.
210.027	And I'm sure you all had your hands
210.027	in mud or clay before.
212.953	It's wonderful to touch. I love it.
214.79	The children loved it.
216.714	And can you imagine the feeling
216.714	of a small boy or a girl
221.593	or an illiterate day laborer standing
221.593	in front of that school building
225.546	and knowing that you built this
227.111	out of the ordinary bamboo
227.111	and just the dirt underneath your feet,
230.729	using nothing but your hands?
235.381	That gives such an enormous boost
235.381	of trust and confidence
241.082	in yourself and the community.
244.63	And in the material.
247.168	Especially mud has a very poor image.
250.061	When we think of mud, we think of dirt --
253.189	it's ugly, it's nondurable --
255.427	and this is the image I want to change.
258.979	In fact, it's the 11th rainy season
258.979	for this school now,
262.75	really harsh, horizontal monsoon rains,
266.028	and the walls are standing strong.
268.951	(Applause)
273.484	So how does it work?
274.85	First rule, a good foundation
274.85	that keeps the wall dry from the ground,
279.03	and second rule, a good roof
279.03	that protects from the top,
282.75	and third rule, erosion control.
286.013	Mud walls need speed breakers
288.323	so that the rainwater
288.323	cannot run down the wall fast,
292.555	and these speed breakers
292.555	could be lines of bamboo
295.861	or stones or straw mixed into the mud,
299.466	just like a hill needs trees or rocks
299.466	in order to prevent erosion.
304.751	It works just the same way.
307.16	And people always ask me
307.16	if I have to add cement to the mud,
311.217	and the answer is no.
313.131	There is no stabilizer,
313.131	no coating on these walls,
316.894	only in the foundation.
320.114	So this is the close-up of the wall
321.956	after 10 rainy seasons,
325.44	and as much as I grew a bit older,
327.904	the wall got some wrinkles as well.
329.65	The edges my not be as sharp as before,
331.841	but it still looks pretty good,
334.017	and if it needs repairing,
335.771	it is really easy to do.
337.786	You just take the broken part,
339.553	make it wet, and put it back on the wall,
342.315	and it will look the same as before.
344.362	Wish that would work on me, too.
345.929	(Laughter)
350.505	Yeah, and the great thing is,
352.685	if an earth wall is not needed anymore,
355.13	it can go back to the ground it came from,
358.395	turn into a garden,
360.327	or get fully recycled
360.327	without any loss of quality.
364.427	There's no other material
364.427	that can do this,
366.542	and this is why mud is so excellent
366.542	in terms of environmental performance.
372.241	What about the economic sustainability?
375.072	When we built the school,
376.362	I practically lived
376.362	on the construction site,
378.763	and in the evening, I used to go
378.763	with the workers to the market,
381.811	and I could see
381.811	how they spent their money.
384.804	And they would buy
384.804	the vegetables from their neighbors,
388.128	they would get a new haircut
388.128	or a new blouse from the tailor.
392.678	And because the main part
392.678	of the building budget
396.56	was spent on craftsmanship,
398.729	the school wasn't just a building,
401.185	it became a real catalyst
401.185	for local development,
405.373	and that made me happy.
408.809	If I had designed the school
408.809	in cement and steel,
411.231	this money would have been exported
411.231	and lost for those families.
416.334	(Applause)
421.755	The building budget at that time
421.755	was 35,000 euros --
425.35	it's probably doubled by now --
427.335	and this is a lot of money
427.335	for that region,
430.447	and especially because this money
430.447	is working within the community
434.476	and rotating fast,
435.778	and not on the stock market.
438.222	So when it comes to the economic
438.222	sustainability of my project,
443.103	my main question is, who gets the profit?
448.769	How many of you in here
450.81	have some experience
450.81	living in a mud house?
453.334	Chris Anderson, where is your hand?
455.395	(Laughter)
456.476	You? OK.
458.959	Yeah.
460.134	It seems totally out of our focus,
463.323	but approximately three billion people
463.323	all around the planet
467.981	are living in earth houses,
470.488	and it is a traditional building material
472.798	in Europe just as much as in Africa.
477.896	Strangely enough,
479.461	mud is not considered worthy
479.461	of being studied at universities ...
484.101	so I brought the dirt to Harvard,
487.323	(Laughter)
489.554	precisely 60 tons of dirt
489.554	right in front of the main facade
493.554	of the Graduate School of Design.
497.298	Students and faculty
497.298	rolled up their sleeves,
499.466	got their hands dirty
500.645	and transformed the front
500.645	into a warm place for people to gather.
505.068	Children would climb the structures,
506.808	skaters would ride the ramp,
508.349	students having lunch breaks,
510.119	and it was particularly fascinating to see
510.119	how many people were touching the wall,
514.215	and we usually don't go around cities
514.215	caressing our facades, right?
518.092	(Laughter)
524.186	(Laughter)
528.423	Of course, this was a small-scale project,
530.454	but in terms of awareness-building
530.454	and in terms of education,
533.574	it was like an acupuncture trigger point.
537.521	And in fact, in more and more countries,
541.125	load-bearing earthen structures
541.125	are not allowed to be built anymore
546.134	although they're traditional
546.134	and have lasted for hundreds of years,
549.66	and not because the material is weak,
551.7	but because there are
551.7	no architects and engineers
554.876	who know how to deal with that material.
557.336	So education on all levels,
559.034	for craftsmen, engineers and architects,
561.734	is really strongly needed.
563.905	Equally important
563.905	is technological development,
567.273	like prefabrication developed
567.273	by my colleague Martin Rauch,
570.39	who is an Austrian artist
570.39	and expert in earthen structures.
574.4	And he has created technologies
574.4	for rammed earth elements,
578.034	for prefabrication
578.034	of rammed earth elements
580.491	that include insulation,
580.491	wall heatings and coolings
584.276	and all sorts of electrical fittings
586.101	that can be layered
586.101	to multistoried buildings,
588.418	and this is important in order to scale up
591.119	and in order to fasten up the processes,
593.111	like in the Ricola Herb Center
593.111	in Switzerland.
598.375	And finally, we need good built projects
601.527	that prove you can build
601.527	with an ancient material
604.646	in a very modern way.
607.254	It is not a matter
607.254	of how old a material is;
610.972	it's a matter of our creative
610.972	ability to use it today.
616.756	These, for example, are three hostels
619.035	that I did in China in the village Baoxi,
621.406	about six hours by bus from Shanghai.
625.679	The outside shape is woven bamboo,
628.394	and the inside core
628.394	is stones and rammed earth.
632.878	And it is a traditional building material.
635.358	Even large parts
635.358	of the Great Wall of China
637.575	have been built with rammed earth,
639.244	but it's getting replaced by concrete.
642.231	And this trend is happening very fast.
645.729	Within only a couple of years,
648.729	China has consumed more cement
648.729	than the United States
651.746	in the entire 20th century.
654.438	And this trend of replacing
654.438	natural building materials
657.971	with materials that require
657.971	a lot of energy,
660.248	that are energy-intensive,
662.058	and that emit CO2
664.123	is really clearly contributing
664.123	to climate change.
667.487	And we have alternatives,
668.924	such as mud, stones, timber,
668.924	bamboo, earth,
673.199	that are totally effective options
673.199	for all sorts of purposes.
677.746	This, for example,
677.746	is an office building that we did
680.317	for Omicron Electronics in Austria.
682.722	Mud is healthy for the planet,
682.722	but also for the human bodies,
685.643	and the material is low-tech,
688.309	but the performance is high-tech.
690.556	The earth walls keep the highly
690.556	sophisticated tools in the building safe
694.659	by naturally regulating moisture.
697.41	And this wall in my own home
700.946	is our humidfier.
704.192	We love our six tons of dirt at home
707.146	not only because
707.146	it's healthy and sustainable.
710.217	Its archaic warmth
710.217	is touching deep within.
714.528	My personal dream is to build
714.528	a mud skyscraper right in Manhattan.
719.64	(Laughter)
721.703	Yeah.
722.878	(Applause)
725.101	And this dream isn't so crazy
726.674	if you think of the mud city
726.674	of Shibam in Yemen
728.89	that was built in the 16th century
730.779	and has lasted now for 500 years.
735.087	What was possible that long ago
735.087	is possible today as well,
739.218	and we can apply
739.218	all our technical know-how
742.846	to these ancient materials
744.88	so that it meets our needs and our dreams.
750.223	All around us,
752.121	and just below our feet ...
754.88	are wonderful natural building materials.
757.671	Let's use them.
760.041	And I deeply believe
761.981	our homes, our work spaces, our cities
765.536	would become more healthy and sustainable
769.36	and more humane
771.907	and beautiful.
773.752	Thank you.
774.927	(Applause)
