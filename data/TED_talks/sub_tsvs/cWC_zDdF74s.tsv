16.219	The job of uncovering the global food waste scandal
18.977	started for me when I was 15 years old.
21.995	I bought some pigs. I was living in Sussex.
24.516	And I started to feed them in the most traditional
26.899	and environmentally friendly way.
28.87	I went to my school kitchen, and I said,
31.195	"""Give me the scraps that my school friends have turned"
32.741	"their noses up at."""
33.607	I went to the local baker and took their stale bread.
36.271	I went to the local greengrocer, and I went to a farmer
39.003	who was throwing away potatoes because they were
40.841	the wrong shape or size for supermarkets.
44.027	This was great. My pigs turned that food waste
47.116	into delicious pork. I sold that pork
49.773	to my school friends' parents, and I made
51.76	a good pocket money addition to my teenage allowance.
56.397	But I noticed that most of the food that I was giving my pigs
59.279	was in fact fit for human consumption,
61.662	and that I was only scratching the surface,
63.931	and that right the way up the food supply chain,
66.793	in supermarkets, greengrocers, bakers, in our homes,
70.011	in factories and farms, we were hemorrhaging out food.
73.271	Supermarkets didn't even want to talk to me
75.868	about how much food they were wasting.
77.242	I'd been round the back. I'd seen bins full of food
79.726	being locked and then trucked off to landfill sites,
82.477	and I thought, surely there is something more sensible
85.498	to do with food than waste it.
88.665	One morning, when I was feeding my pigs,
90.97	I noticed a particularly tasty-looking sun-dried tomato loaf
94.657	that used to crop up from time to time.
96.732	I grabbed hold of it,
98.134	sat down, and ate my breakfast with my pigs. (Laughter)
101.68	That was the first act of what I later learned to call freeganism,
104.8	really an exhibition of the injustice of food waste,
109.055	and the provision of the solution to food waste,
111.405	which is simply to sit down and eat food,
114.059	rather than throwing it away.
115.547	That became, as it were, a way of confronting
118.826	large businesses in the business of wasting food,
121.813	and exposing, most importantly, to the public,
124.334	that when we're talking about food being thrown away,
126.504	we're not talking about rotten stuff, we're not talking about
128.643	stuff that's beyond the pale.
131.355	We're talking about good, fresh food that is being wasted
133.471	on a colossal scale.
136.009	Eventually, I set about writing my book,
137.866	really to demonstrate the extent of this problem
139.92	on a global scale. What this shows is
143.316	a nation-by-nation breakdown of the likely level
146.795	of food waste in each country in the world.
149.897	Unfortunately, empirical data, good, hard stats, don't exist,
153.785	and therefore to prove my point, I first of all had to find
156.267	some proxy way of uncovering
158.42	how much food was being wasted.
160.665	So I took the food supply of every single country
163.221	and I compared it to what was actually likely
166.263	to be being consumed in each country.
168.295	That's based on diet intake surveys, it's based on
172.182	levels of obesity, it's based on a range of factors
174.848	that gives you an approximate guess
176.19	as to how much food is actually going into people's mouths.
179.417	That black line in the middle of that table
182.146	is the likely level of consumption
185.142	with an allowance for certain levels of inevitable waste.
189.504	There will always be waste. I'm not that unrealistic
191.423	that I think we can live in a waste-free world.
193.403	But that black line shows what a food supply should be
197.276	in a country if they allow for a good, stable, secure,
201.73	nutritional diet for every person in that country.
205.479	Any dot above that line, and you'll quickly notice that
207.886	that includes most countries in the world,
210.587	represents unnecessary surplus, and is likely to reflect
214.876	levels of waste in each country.
217.498	As a country gets richer, it invests more and more
220.767	in getting more and more surplus
222.058	into its shops and restaurants,
224.868	and as you can see, most European
226.924	and North American countries
228.336	fall between 150 and 200 percent
231.476	of the nutritional requirements of their populations.
234.856	So a country like America has twice as much food
237.264	on its shop shelves and in its restaurants
239.868	than is actually required to feed the American people.
243.436	But the thing that really struck me,
244.996	when I plotted all this data, and it was a lot of numbers,
249.211	was that you can see how it levels off.
252.877	Countries rapidly shoot towards that 150 mark,
255.945	and then they level off, and they don't really go on rising
259.233	as you might expect.
260.779	So I decided to unpack that data a little bit further
263.324	to see if that was true or false.
265.609	And that's what I came up with.
267.103	If you include not just the food that ends up
269.03	in shops and restaurants, but also the food
271.154	that people feed to livestock,
273.31	the maize, the soy, the wheat, that humans could eat
276.813	but choose to fatten livestock instead to produce
279.294	increasing amounts of meat and dairy products,
281.225	what you find is that most rich countries
282.892	have between three and four times the amount of food
287.215	that their population needs to feed itself.
290.299	A country like America has four times the amount of food
293.582	that it needs.
296.544	When people talk about the need to increase global
299.506	food production to feed those nine billion people
302.166	that are expected on the planet by 2050,
304.678	I always think of these graphs.
306.399	The fact is, we have an enormous buffer
309.35	in rich countries between ourselves and hunger.
313.231	We've never had such gargantuan surpluses before.
317.907	In many ways, this is a great success story
320.573	of human civilization, of the agricultural surpluses
324.712	that we set out to achieve 12,000 years ago.
328.065	It is a success story. It has been a success story.
331.622	But what we have to recognize now is that we are
334.159	reaching the ecological limits that our planet can bear,
337.791	and when we chop down forests, as we are every day,
340.428	to grow more and more food,
341.776	when we extract water from depleting water reserves,
345.524	when we emit fossil fuel emissions in the quest
348.912	to grow more and more food,
350.204	and then we throw away so much of it,
353.055	we have to think about what we can start saving.
355.991	And yesterday, I went to one of the local supermarkets
359.716	that I often visit to
361.932	inspect, if you like, what they're throwing away.
366.113	I found quite a few packets of biscuits amongst
368.516	all the fruit and vegetables and everything else
370.143	that was in there.
371.09	And I thought, well this could serve as a symbol for today.
373.53	So I want you to imagine that these nine biscuits
375.965	that I found in the bin represent the global food supply,
379.493	okay? We start out with nine.
381.094	That's what's in fields around the world every single year.
384.577	The first biscuit we're going to lose
386.338	before we even leave the farm.
388.097	That's a problem primarily associated with
391.362	developing work agriculture, whether it's
393.026	a lack of infrastructure, refrigeration, pasteurization,
395.531	grain stores, even basic fruit crates, which means
398.444	that food goes to waste before it even leaves the fields.
402.193	The next three biscuits are the foods that we decide
405.689	to feed to livestock, the maize, the wheat and the soya.
409.429	Unfortunately, our beasts are inefficient animals,
414.273	and they turn two-thirds of that into feces and heat,
418.448	so we've lost those two, and we've only kept this one
421.066	in meat and dairy products.
423.3	Two more we're going to throw away directly into bins.
426.884	This is what most of us think of when we think
428.437	of food waste, what ends up in the garbage,
430.948	what ends up in supermarket bins,
432.796	what ends up in restaurant bins. We've lost another two,
435.526	and we've left ourselves with just four biscuits to feed on.
439.284	That is not a superlatively efficient use of global resources,
443.083	especially when you think of the billion hungry people
445.543	that exist already in the world.
447.683	Having gone through the data, I then needed
449.666	to demonstrate where that food ends up.
453.344	Where does it end up? We're used to seeing the stuff
454.963	on our plates, but what about all the stuff
456.866	that goes missing in between?
458.806	Supermarkets are an easy place to start.
461.218	This is the result of my hobby,
463.809	which is unofficial bin inspections. (Laughter)
468.285	Strange you might think, but if we could rely on corporations
470.882	to tell us what they were doing in the back of their stores,
473.99	we wouldn't need to go sneaking around the back,
476.474	opening up bins and having a look at what's inside.
479.03	But this is what you can see more or less on
480.99	every street corner in Britain, in Europe, in North America.
484.502	It represents a colossal waste of food,
487.568	but what I discovered whilst I was writing my book
490.07	was that this very evident abundance of waste
493.414	was actually the tip of the iceberg.
496.358	When you start going up the supply chain,
498.414	you find where the real food waste is happening
501.4	on a gargantuan scale.
503.387	Can I have a show of hands
504.86	if you have a loaf of sliced bread in your house?
509.318	Who lives in a household where that crust --
511.237	that slice at the first and last end of each loaf --
514.43	who lives in a household where it does get eaten?
516.874	Okay, most people, not everyone, but most people,
519.241	and this is, I'm glad to say, what I see across the world,
521.697	and yet has anyone seen a supermarket or sandwich shop
524.486	anywhere in the world that serves sandwiches
526.722	with crusts on it? (Laughter)
528.496	I certainly haven't.
530.079	So I kept on thinking, where do those crusts go? (Laughter)
535.247	This is the answer, unfortunately:
539.374	this one single factory every single day, day-fresh bread.
544.975	In the same year that I visited this factory,
546.484	I went to Pakistan, where people in 2008 were going hungry
550.934	as a result of a squeeze on global food supplies.
554.711	We contribute to that squeeze
556.895	by depositing food in bins here in Britain
559.887	and elsewhere in the world. We take food
562.094	off the market shelves that hungry people depend on.
565.2	Go one step up, and you get to farmers,
567.75	who throw away sometimes a third or even more
569.91	of their harvest because of cosmetic standards.
571.955	This farmer, for example, has invested 16,000 pounds
574.878	in growing spinach, not one leaf of which he harvested,
578.302	because there was a little bit of grass growing in amongst it.
580.756	Potatoes that are cosmetically imperfect,
583.236	all going for pigs.
584.769	Parsnips that are too small for supermarket specifications,
588.807	tomatoes in Tenerife,
590.823	oranges in Florida,
592.628	bananas in Ecuador, where I visited last year,
595.632	all being discarded. This is one day's waste
598.047	from one banana plantation in Ecuador.
600.584	All being discarded, perfectly edible,
602.792	because they're the wrong shape or size.
605.28	If we do that to fruit and vegetables,
606.86	you bet we can do it to animals too.
609.675	Liver, lungs, heads, tails,
612.414	kidneys, testicles,
614.392	all of these things which are traditional,
616.105	delicious and nutritious parts of our gastronomy
618.92	go to waste. Offal consumption has halved
622.416	in Britain and America in the last 30 years.
624.951	As a result, this stuff gets fed to dogs at best,
627.591	or is incinerated.
629.36	This man, in Kashgar, Xinjiang province, in Western China,
633.207	is serving up his national dish.
635.122	It's called sheep's organs.
636.837	It's delicious, it's nutritious,
638.504	and as I learned when I went to Kashgar,
640.912	it symbolizes their taboo against food waste.
643.981	I was sitting in a roadside cafe.
646.177	A chef came to talk to me, I finished my bowl,
648.781	and halfway through the conversation, he stopped talking
650.546	and he started frowning into my bowl.
653.112	"I thought, ""My goodness, what taboo have I broken?"
654.991	"How have I insulted my host?"""
656.585	He pointed at three grains of rice
658.323	"at the bottom of my bowl, and he said, ""Clean."" (Laughter)"
662.607	"I thought, ""My God, you know, I go around the world"
664.519	telling people to stop wasting food.
665.935	"This guy has thrashed me at my own game."" (Laughter)"
670.984	But it gave me faith. It gave me faith that we, the people,
674.207	do have the power to stop this tragic waste of resources
679.243	if we regard it as socially unacceptable
681.443	to waste food on a colossal scale,
682.947	if we make noise about it, tell corporations about it,
685.515	tell governments we want to see an end to food waste,
688.135	we do have the power to bring about that change.
690.631	Fish, 40 to 60 percent of European fish
693.343	are discarded at sea, they don't even get landed.
696.424	In our homes, we've lost touch with food.
699.116	This is an experiment I did on three lettuces.
702.033	Who keeps lettuces in their fridge?
704.671	Most people. The one on the left
708.247	was kept in a fridge for 10 days.
709.7	The one in the middle, on my kitchen table. Not much difference.
711.919	The one on the right I treated like cut flowers.
714.494	It's a living organism, cut the slice off,
716.676	stuck it in a vase of water,
718.119	it was all right for another two weeks after this.
721.667	Some food waste, as I said at the beginning,
723.626	will inevitably arise, so the question is,
725.458	what is the best thing to do with it?
727.656	I answered that question when I was 15.
729.162	In fact, humans answered that question 6,000 years ago:
734.572	We domesticated pigs
736.784	to turn food waste back into food.
739.556	And yet, in Europe, that practice has become illegal
743.287	since 2001 as a result of the foot-and-mouth outbreak.
746.574	It's unscientific. It's unnecessary.
748.475	If you cook food for pigs, just as if
751.158	you cook food for humans, it is rendered safe.
754.127	It's also a massive saving of resources.
756.687	At the moment, Europe depends on importing
759.582	millions of tons of soy from South America,
761.248	where its production contributes to global warming,
764.134	to deforestation, to biodiversity loss,
766.734	to feed livestock here in Europe.
769.181	At the same time we throw away millions of tons
771.483	of food waste which we could and should be feeding them.
774.702	If we did that, and fed it to pigs, we would save
777.564	that amount of carbon.
779.915	If we feed our food waste which is the current
783.007	government favorite way of getting rid of food waste,
785.302	to anaerobic digestion, which turns food waste
788.103	into gas to produce electricity,
790.407	you save a paltry 448 kilograms of carbon dioxide
794.14	per ton of food waste. It's much better to feed it to pigs.
796.622	We knew that during the war. (Laughter)
799.882	A silver lining: It has kicked off globally,
804.156	the quest to tackle food waste.
805.926	Feeding the 5,000 is an event I first organized in 2009.
809.78	We fed 5,000 people all on food that otherwise
812.036	would have been wasted.
813.434	Since then, it's happened again in London,
815.734	it's happening internationally, and across the country.
817.867	It's a way of organizations coming together
820.21	to celebrate food, to say the best thing to do with food
823.952	is to eat and enjoy it, and to stop wasting it.
826.759	For the sake of the planet we live on,
829.352	for the sake of our children,
832.632	for the sake of all the other
834.202	organisms that share our planet with us,
836.65	we are a terrestrial animal, and we depend on our land
839.691	for food. At the moment, we are trashing our land
842.313	to grow food that no one eats.
844.827	Stop wasting food. Thank you very much. (Applause)
847.923	(Applause)
