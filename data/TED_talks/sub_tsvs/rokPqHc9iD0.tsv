12.64	We can cut violent deaths
12.64	around the world
17.87	by 50 percent in the next three decades.
22.12	All we have to do
22.12	is drop killing by 2.3 percent a year,
27.191	and we'll hit that target.
29.644	You don't believe me?
31.339	Well, the leading epidemiologists
31.339	and criminologists around the world
34.613	seem to think we can, and so do I,
37.004	but only if we focus on our cities,
37.004	especially the most fragile ones.
42.139	You see, I've been thinking
42.139	about this a lot.
46.408	For the last 20 years, I've been working
48.32	in countries and cities
48.32	ripped apart by conflict,
51.888	violence, terrorism, or some
51.888	insidious combination of all.
55.905	I've tracked gun smugglers
55.905	from Russia to Somalia,
59.411	I've worked with warlords
59.411	in Afghanistan and the Congo,
62.583	I've counted cadavers in Colombia, in 
62.583	Haiti, in Sri Lanka, in Papua New Guinea.
68.285	You don't need to be
68.285	on the front line, though,
70.535	to get a sense that our planet
70.535	is spinning out of control, right?
73.847	There's this feeling that international
73.847	instability is the new normal.
78.396	But I want you to take a closer look,
80.527	and I think you'll see that
80.527	the geography of violence is changing,
83.739	because it's not so much our nation states
83.739	that are gripped by conflict and crime
87.547	as our cities: Aleppo, Bamako, Caracas, 
87.547	Erbil, Mosul, Tripoli, Salvador.
95.071	Violence is migrating to the metropole.
98.196	And maybe this is to be expected, right?
100.921	After all, most people today,
100.921	they live in cities, not the countryside.
104.868	Just 600 cities, including 30 megacities,
104.868	account for two thirds of global GDP.
110.704	But when it comes to cities,
112.463	the conversation is
112.463	dominated by the North,
115.122	that is, North America, Western Europe,
115.122	Australia and Japan,
118.521	where violence is 
118.521	actually at historic lows.
121.668	As a result, city enthusiasts, they talk
121.668	about the triumph of the city,
126.369	of the creative classes, and the mayors
126.369	that will rule the world.
130.315	Now, I hope that mayors
130.315	do one day rule the world,
133.801	but, you know, the fact is,
135.838	we don't hear any conversation, really,
135.838	about what is happening in the South.
140.207	And by South, I mean
140.207	Latin America, Africa, Asia,
144.584	where violence in some
144.584	cases is accelerating,
147.312	where infrastructure is overstretched,
149.913	and where governance is sometimes
149.913	an aspiration and not a reality.
154.268	Now, some diplomats
154.268	and development experts and specialists,
158.591	they talk about 40 to 50 fragile states
161.256	that will shape security
161.256	in the 21st century.
164.878	I think it's fragile cities which will
164.878	define the future of order and disorder.
170.063	That's because warfare
170.063	and humanitarian action
173.414	are going to be
173.414	concentrated in our cities,
175.628	and the fight for development,
177.201	whether you define that
177.201	as eradicating poverty,
179.892	universal healthcare,
179.892	beating back climate change,
182.325	will be won or lost in the shantytowns,
182.325	slums and favelas of our cities.
187.996	I want to talk to you about four megarisks
190.552	that I think will define
190.552	fragility in our time,
193.801	and if we can get to grips with these,
196.03	I think we can do something
196.03	with that lethal violence problem.
198.975	So let me start with some good news.
201.347	Fact is, we're living in the most
201.347	peaceful moment in human history.
206.778	Steven Pinker and others have shown how
206.778	the intensity and frequency of conflict
210.959	is actually at an all-time low.
213.699	Now, Gaza, Syria, Sudan, Ukraine,
217.345	as ghastly as these conflicts are,
217.345	and they are horrific,
221.176	they represent a relatively
221.176	small blip upwards
223.916	in a 50-year-long secular decline.
226.911	What's more, we're seeing
226.911	a dramatic reduction in homicide.
231.218	Manuel Eisner and others have shown
233.435	that for centuries, we've seen
233.435	this incredible drop in murder,
237.145	especially in the West.
239.09	Most Northern cities today are 100 times
239.09	safer than they were just 100 years ago.
244.526	These two facts -- the decline in armed 
244.526	conflict and the decline in murder --
248.271	are amongst the most extraordinary,
249.95	if unheralded, accomplishments
249.95	of human history,
252.527	and we should be really excited, right?
255.827	Well, yeah, we should.
257.655	There's just one problem:
257.655	These two scourges are still with us.
262.044	You see, 525,000 people --
262.044	men, women, boys and girls --
268.148	die violently every single year.
271.329	Research I've been doing
271.329	with Keith Krause and others
273.929	has shown that between 50,000 and 60,000
273.929	people are dying in war zones violently.
279.386	The rest, almost 500,000 people,
279.386	are dying outside of conflict zones.
284.4	In other words, 10 times more people
284.4	are dying outside of war than inside war.
290.393	What's more, violence is moving south,
293.488	to Latin America and the Caribbean,
296.196	to parts of Central and Southern Africa,
298.477	and to bits of the Middle East
298.477	and Central Asia.
301.351	Forty of the 50 most dangerous 
301.351	cities in the world
304.12	are right here in Latin America,
307.528	and the most dangerous of all, it's 
307.528	San Pedro Sula, Honduras' second city,
312.765	with a staggering homicide rate
312.765	of 187 murders per 100,000 people.
317.581	That's 23 times the global average.
320.72	Now, if violence is
320.72	re-concentrating geographically,
323.447	it's also being reconfigured
323.447	to the world's new topography,
326.26	because when it comes to cities,
326.26	the world ain't flat,
328.799	like Thomas Friedman likes to say.
331.077	It's spiky.
332.413	The dominance of the city
332.413	as the primary mode of urban living
336.327	is one of the most extraordinary
336.327	demographic reversals in history,
340.614	and it all happened so fast.
343.702	You all know the figures, right?
345.227	There's 7.3 billion people
345.227	in the world today;
347.469	there will be 9.6 billion by 2050.
349.858	But consider this one fact:
351.922	In the 1800s, one in 30
351.922	people lived in cities,
355.114	today it's one in two,
357.634	and tomorrow virtually everyone
357.634	is going to be there.
360.792	And this expansion in urbanization
360.792	is going to be neither even nor equitable.
364.878	The vast majority, 90 percent,
366.521	will be happening in the South,
366.521	in cities of the South.
370.737	So urban geographers and demographers,
373.864	they tell us that it's not necessarily
373.864	the size or even the density of cities
378.159	that predicts violence, no.
380.249	Tokyo, with 35 million people,
382.501	is one of the largest, and some might say
382.501	safest, urban metropolises in the world.
387.229	No, it's the speed of
387.229	urbanization that matters.
390.976	I call this turbo-urbanization, and it's 
390.976	one of the key drivers of fragility.
396.823	When you think about the incredible
396.823	expansion of these cities,
401.611	and you think about turbo-urbanization,
401.611	think about Karachi.
405.218	Karachi was about 500,000 people in 1947,
405.218	a hustling, bustling city.
411.127	Today, it's 21 million people,
414.824	and apart from accounting
414.824	for three quarters of Pakistan's GDP,
418.769	it's also one of the most violent
418.769	cities in South Asia.
421.863	Dhaka, Lagos, Kinshasa,
424.667	these cities are now 40 times larger
424.667	than they were in the 1950s.
429.542	Now take a look at New York.
431.44	The Big Apple, it took 150 years
431.44	to get to eight million people.
436.636	São Paulo, Mexico City, took 15
436.636	to reach that same interval.
441.947	Now, what do these medium,
441.947	large, mega-, and hypercities look like?
445.84	What is their profile?
447.379	Well, for one thing, they're young.
449.214	What we're seeing in many of them
449.214	is the rise of the youth bulge.
452.836	Now, this is actually a good news story.
454.748	It's a function of reductions
454.748	in child mortality rates.
457.338	But the youth bulge is something
457.338	we've got to watch.
459.795	What it basically means
461.226	is the proportion of young people
461.226	living in our fragile cities
464.125	is much larger than those living 
464.125	in our healthier and wealthier ones.
467.627	In some fragile cities,
	is under the age of 30.
472.727	Think about that:
472.727	Three in four people are under 30.
477.479	It's like Palo Alto on steroids.
480.324	Now, if you look at Mogadishu for example,
483.064	in Mogadishu the mean age is 16 years old.
487.174	Ditto for Dhaka, Dili and Kabul.
490.076	And Tokyo? It's 46.
492.828	Same for most Western European cities.
496.229	Now, it's not just youth
496.229	that necessarily predicts violence.
499.409	That's one factor among many,
501.453	but youthfulness combined
501.453	with unemployment, lack of education,
504.429	and -- this is the kicker -- 
504.429	being male, is a deadly proposition.
508.535	They're statistically correlated,
508.535	all those risk factors, with youth,
512.036	and they tend to relate
512.036	to increases in violence.
516.033	Now, for those of you who are
516.033	parents of teenage sons,
519.358	you know what I'm talking about, right?
521.304	Just imagine your boy
521.304	without any structure
524.214	with those unruly friends of his,
524.214	out there cavorting about.
527.915	Now, take away the parents,
530.106	take away the education,
530.106	limit the education possibilities,
534.476	sprinkle in a little bit of drugs,
534.476	alcohol and guns,
537.721	and sit back and watch the fireworks.
540.924	The implications are disconcerting.
543.021	Right here in Brazil,
543.021	the life expectancy is 73.6 years.
546.536	If you live in Rio, I'm sorry,
546.536	shave off two right there.
550.211	But if you're young, you're uneducated,
552.498	you lack employment,
552.498	you're black, and you're male,
555.012	your life expectancy drops
555.012	to less than 60 years old.
558.224	There's a reason why youthfulness
558.224	and violence are the number one killers
563.081	in this country.
565.422	Okay, so it's not all doom
565.422	and gloom in our cities.
568.696	After all, cities are hubs of innovation,
571.064	dynamism, prosperity, 
571.064	excitement, connectivity.
574.653	They're where the smart people gather.
576.905	And those young people I just mentioned,
578.846	they're more digitally savvy
578.846	and tech-aware than ever before.
582.49	And this explosion, the Internet,
582.49	and mobile technology,
586.064	means that the digital divide
586.064	separating the North and the South
589.779	between countries
589.779	and within them, is shrinking.
593.029	But as we've heard so many times,
594.644	these new technologies
594.644	are dual-edged, right?
597.376	Take the case of law enforcement.
599.519	Police around the world are starting
599.519	to use remote sensing and big data
603.106	to anticipate crime.
604.701	Some cops are able to predict
604.701	criminal violence before it even happens.
609.121	The future crime scenario,
609.121	it's here today,
612.526	and we've got to be careful.
614.026	We have to manage the issues
614.026	of the public safety
616.321	against rights to individual privacy.
618.987	But it's not just the cops
618.987	who are innovating.
621.138	We've heard extraordinary activities
621.138	of civil society groups
623.982	who are engaging in local 
623.982	and global collective action,
627.117	and this is leading to digital protest
627.117	and real revolution.
631.74	But most worrying
631.74	of all are criminal gangs
635.136	who are going online
635.136	and starting to colonize cyberspace.
638.045	In Ciudad Juárez in Mexico,
638.045	where I've been working,
641.177	groups like the Zetas
641.177	and the Sinaloa cartel
643.531	are hijacking social media.
645.152	They're using it to recruit,
645.152	to sell their products,
647.736	to coerce, to intimidate and to kill.
649.966	Violence is going virtual.
653.149	So this is just a partial sketch
655.282	of a fast-moving and dynamic
655.282	and complex situation.
657.958	I mean, there are many other megarisks
659.807	that are going to define
659.807	fragility in our time,
662.242	not least income inequality,
664.141	poverty, climate change, impunity.
667.879	But we're facing a stark dilemma
670.224	where some cities are going to thrive
670.224	and drive global growth
674.283	and others are going to stumble
674.283	and pull it backwards.
677.219	If we're going to change course,
677.219	we need to start a conversation.
680.445	We can't only focus
680.445	on those cities that work,
683.436	the Singapores, the Kuala Lumpurs,
685.944	the Dubais, the Shanghais.
687.824	We've got to bring those fragile cities
687.824	into the conversation.
692.028	One way to do this might be
692.028	to start twinning
694.558	our fragile cities with our healthier
694.558	and wealthier ones,
697.298	kickstarting a process of learning
697.298	and collaboration
699.811	and sharing of practices,
699.811	of what works and what doesn't.
704.05	A wonderful example of this is coming
704.05	from El Salvador and Los Angeles,
707.642	where the mayors in San Salvador
707.642	and Los Angeles are collaborating
711.802	on getting ex-gang members
711.802	to work with current gang members,
715.755	offering tutoring, education,
718.543	and in the process are helping
718.543	incubate cease-fires and truces,
721.863	and we've seen homicide rates
721.863	go down in San Salvador,
724.41	once the world's most violent city,
726.233	by 50 percent.
727.877	We can also focus 
727.877	on hot cities, but also hot spots.
730.426	Place and location matter fundamentally
730.426	in shaping violence in our cities.
734.728	Did you know that between
734.728	one and two percent
737.283	of street addresses in any fragile city
739.348	can predict up to 99 percent
739.348	of violent crime?
743.05	Take the case of São Paulo,
743.05	where I've been working.
745.614	It's gone from being Brazil's most
745.614	dangerous city to one of its safest,
749.367	and it did this by doubling down
751.326	on information collection,
751.326	hot spot mapping, and police reform,
754.557	and in the process, it dropped homicide
754.557	by 70 percent in just over 10 years.
759.595	We also got to focus on those hot people.
762.05	It's tragic, but being young,
762.05	unemployed, uneducated, male,
766.139	increases the risks
766.139	of being killed and killing.
770.136	We have to break this cycle of violence
772.821	and get in there early with our children,
772.821	our youngest children,
776.155	and valorize them, not stigmatize them.
779.214	There's wonderful work that's happening
779.214	that I've been involved with
782.584	in Kingston, Jamaica
782.584	and right here in Rio,
784.875	which is putting education,
784.875	employment, recreation
788.173	up front for these high-risk groups,
790.329	and as a result, we're seeing violence
790.329	going down in their communities.
793.684	We've also got to make our cities safer,
793.684	more inclusive, and livable for all.
797.362	The fact is, social cohesion matters.
801.129	Mobility matters in our cities.
803.609	We've got to get away from this model
803.609	of segregation, exclusion,
806.679	and cities with walls.
808.095	My favorite example of how to do this
808.095	comes from Medellín.
810.905	When I lived in Colombia
810.905	in the late 1990s,
812.91	Medellín was the murder capital 
812.91	of the world, but it changed course,
816.541	and it did this by deliberately investing
816.541	in its low-income and most violent areas
820.8	and integrating them
820.8	with the middle-class ones
823.208	through a network of cable cars,
824.88	of public transport,
824.88	and first-class infrastructure,
827.527	and in the process, it dropped homicide
827.527	by 79 percent in just under two decades.
832.349	And finally, there's technology.
835.119	Technology has enormous
835.119	promise but also peril.
837.901	We've seen examples here
837.901	of extraordinary innovation,
840.449	and much of it coming from this room,
842.242	The police are engaging 
842.242	in predictive analytics.
844.61	Citizens are engaging
844.61	in new crowdsourcing solutions.
847.2	Even my own group is involved
847.2	in developing applications
849.847	to provide more accountability over police
849.847	and increase safety among citizens.
854.199	But we need to be careful.
857.687	If I have one single
857.687	message for you, it's this:
861.076	There is nothing inevitable
861.076	about lethal violence,
864.561	and we can make our cities safer.
869.312	Folks, we have the opportunity
869.312	of a lifetime to drop homicidal violence
875.358	in half within our lifetime.
878.005	So I have just one question:
879.738	What are we waiting for?
881.283	Thank you.
883.067	(Applause)
