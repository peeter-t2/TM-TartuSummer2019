15.26	A few years ago,
15.26	I felt like I was stuck in a rut,
20.26	so I decided to follow in the footsteps
22.26	of the great American
22.26	philosopher, Morgan Spurlock,
25.82	and try something new for 30 days.
28.783	The idea is actually pretty simple.
30.935	Think about something you've always
30.935	wanted to add to your life
33.96	and try it for the next 30 days.
37.157	It turns out 30 days is just
37.157	about the right amount of time
40.575	to add a new habit or subtract a habit --
43.291	like watching the news --
44.56	from your life.
46.26	There's a few things I learned
46.26	while doing these 30-day challenges.
49.882	The first was,
51.26	instead of the months
51.26	flying by, forgotten,
54.26	the time was much more memorable.
57.26	This was part of a challenge I did
57.26	to take a picture every day for a month.
60.856	And I remember exactly where I was
60.856	and what I was doing that day.
66.392	I also noticed
67.693	that as I started to do more
67.693	and harder 30-day challenges,
71.046	my self-confidence grew.
72.839	I went from desk-dwelling computer nerd
74.76	to the kind of guy who bikes to work.
77.857	For fun!
79.129	(Laughter)
80.503	Even last year, I ended up hiking
80.503	up Mt. Kilimanjaro,
83.55	the highest mountain in Africa.
85.26	I would never have been that adventurous
85.26	before I started my 30-day challenges.
91.26	I also figured out that if you
91.26	really want something badly enough,
95.881	you can do anything for 30 days.
99.365	Have you ever wanted to write a novel?
102.219	Every November,
103.534	tens of thousands of people
104.86	try to write their own
108.965	in 30 days.
110.923	It turns out, all you have to do
110.923	is write 1,667 words a day
115.796	for a month.
117.833	So I did.
119.26	By the way, the secret
119.26	is not to go to sleep
122.145	until you've written
122.145	your words for the day.
124.79	You might be sleep-deprived,
126.26	but you'll finish your novel.
129.029	Now is my book the next great
129.029	American novel?
132.707	No. I wrote it in a month.
134.26	It's awful.
136.12	(Laughter)
137.786	But for the rest of my life,
139.995	if I meet John Hodgman at a TED party,
142.26	I don't have to say,
144.26	"""I'm a computer scientist."""
146.26	No, no, if I want to,
146.26	"I can say, ""I'm a novelist."""
149.623	(Laughter)
153.009	So here's one last thing
153.009	I'd like to mention.
155.26	I learned that when I made
155.26	small, sustainable changes,
158.763	things I could keep doing,
160.26	they were more likely to stick.
162.507	There's nothing wrong
162.507	with big, crazy challenges.
165.26	In fact, they're a ton of fun.
168.088	But they're less likely to stick.
170.51	When I gave up sugar for 30 days,
173.102	day 31 looked like this.
174.941	(Laughter)
177.269	So here's my question to you:
179.734	What are you waiting for?
181.493	I guarantee you the next 30 days
183.795	are going to pass
183.795	whether you like it or not,
187.419	so why not think about something
187.419	you have always wanted to try
192.142	and give it a shot!
193.971	For the next 30 days.
195.916	Thanks.
197.26	(Applause)
