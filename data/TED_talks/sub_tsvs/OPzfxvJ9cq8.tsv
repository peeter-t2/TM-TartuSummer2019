12.96	Imagine being unable to say,
12.96	"""I am hungry,"" ""I am in pain,"""
18.28	"""thank you,"" or ""I love you."""
20.84	Being trapped inside your body,
22.96	a body that doesn't respond to commands.
26.12	Surrounded by people,
27.8	yet utterly alone.
29.44	Wishing you could reach out,
31.16	to connect, to comfort, to participate.
35.4	For 13 long years, that was my reality.
39.52	Most of us never think twice
39.52	about talking, about communicating.
45.08	I've thought a lot about it.
47.24	I've had a lot of time to think.
49.92	For the first 12 years of my life,
52.04	I was a normal, happy, healthy little boy.
54.76	Then everything changed.
56.92	I contracted a brain infection.
59.2	The doctors weren't sure what it was,
61.52	but they treated me the best they could.
64.04	However, I progressively got worse.
67.44	Eventually, I lost my ability
67.44	to control my movements,
71.64	make eye contact,
73	and finally, my ability to speak.
77.28	While in hospital,
78.52	I desperately wanted to go home.
81.12	"I said to my mother, ""When home?"""
84.44	Those were the last words
84.44	I ever spoke with my own voice.
88.92	I would eventually fail every test
88.92	for mental awareness.
92.76	My parents were told
92.76	I was as good as not there.
95.6	A vegetable, having the intelligence
95.6	of a three-month-old baby.
100.24	They were told to take me home
100.24	and try to keep me comfortable
103.92	until I died.
106	My parents, in fact
106	my entire family's lives,
109.56	became consumed by taking care of me
109.56	the best they knew how.
113.88	Their friends drifted away.
116.24	One year turned to two,
118.08	two turned to three.
120.24	It seemed like the person I once was
120.24	began to disappear.
124.68	The Lego blocks and electronic circuits
124.68	I'd loved as a boy were put away.
129.6	I had been moved out of my bedroom
129.6	into another more practical one.
134.08	I had become a ghost,
135.8	a faded memory of a boy
135.8	people once knew and loved.
140.199	Meanwhile, my mind began
140.199	knitting itself back together.
144.48	Gradually, my awareness started to return.
147.52	But no one realized
147.52	that I had come back to life.
150.88	I was aware of everything,
152.72	just like any normal person.
154.76	I could see and understand everything,
157.08	but I couldn't find a way
157.08	to let anybody know.
160.56	My personality was entombed
160.56	within a seemingly silent body,
164.56	a vibrant mind hidden in plain sight
164.56	within a chrysalis.
168.92	The stark reality hit me
168.92	that I was going to spend
171.68	the rest of my life locked inside myself,
174.36	totally alone.
176.08	I was trapped with only
176.08	my thoughts for company.
179.72	I would never be rescued.
181.92	No one would ever show me tenderness.
184.88	I would never talk to a friend.
187.16	No one would ever love me.
189.92	I had no dreams, no hope,
189.92	nothing to look forward to.
194.08	Well, nothing pleasant.
196.6	I lived in fear,
197.96	and, to put it bluntly,
199.52	was waiting for death
199.52	to finally release me,
202.6	expecting to die all alone in a care home.
206.52	I don't know if it's truly possible
206.52	to express in words
209.92	what it's like not to be able
209.92	to communicate.
212.76	Your personality appears
212.76	to vanish into a heavy fog
216.2	and all of your emotions and desires are
216.2	constricted, stifled and muted within you.
222	For me, the worst was the feeling
222	of utter powerlessness.
226.52	I simply existed.
228.68	It's a very dark place to find yourself
231.16	because in a sense, you have vanished.
235	Other people controlled
235	every aspect of my life.
238.24	They decided what I ate and when.
240.56	Whether I was laid on my side
240.56	or strapped into my wheelchair.
244.56	I often spent my days
244.56	positioned in front of the TV
247.96	watching Barney reruns.
250.44	I think because Barney
250.44	is so happy and jolly,
253.36	and I absolutely wasn't,
255.12	it made it so much worse.
257.8	I was completely powerless
257.8	to change anything in my life
261.24	or people's perceptions of me.
263.72	I was a silent, invisible observer
263.72	of how people behaved
267.32	when they thought no one was watching.
269.72	Unfortunately, I wasn't only an observer.
273.44	With no way to communicate,
273.44	I became the perfect victim:
277.44	a defenseless object,
277.44	seemingly devoid of feelings
281.44	that people used
281.44	to play out their darkest desires.
285.2	For more than 10 years,
285.2	people who were charged with my care
288.88	abused me physically,
288.88	verbally and sexually.
292.76	Despite what they thought, I did feel.
296.4	The first time it happened,
298.16	I was shocked and filled with disbelief.
300.84	How could they do this to me?
303.12	I was confused.
304.72	What had I done to deserve this?
307.44	Part of me wanted to cry
307.44	and another part wanted to fight.
311.52	Hurt, sadness and anger
311.52	flooded through me.
315.28	I felt worthless.
317.08	There was no one to comfort me.
320.08	But neither of my parents
320.08	knew this was happening.
323.36	I lived in terror, knowing
323.36	it would happen again and again.
327.44	I just never knew when.
329.56	All I knew was that I would
329.56	never be the same.
333.36	I remember once listening
333.36	to Whitney Houston singing,
337	"""No matter what they take from me,"
337	"they can't take away my dignity."""
341.88	And I thought to myself,
341.88	"""You want to bet?"""
347.12	Perhaps my parents could have
347.12	found out and could have helped.
350.88	But the years of constant caretaking,
353.16	having to wake up
353.16	every two hours to turn me,
356.08	combined with them essentially
356.08	grieving the loss of their son,
359.48	had taken a toll on my mother and father.
362.84	Following yet another heated argument
362.84	between my parents,
366.44	in a moment of despair and desperation,
369.08	my mother turned to me
369.08	and told me that I should die.
374.16	I was shocked, but as I thought
374.16	about what she had said,
377.32	I was filled with enormous compassion
377.32	and love for my mother,
381.36	yet I could do nothing about it.
384.64	There were many moments when I gave up,
387.04	sinking into a dark abyss.
389.44	I remember one particularly low moment.
392.6	My dad left me alone in the car
394.88	while he quickly went
394.88	to buy something from the store.
398.48	A random stranger walked past,
401.12	looked at me and he smiled.
404.88	I may never know why, but that simple act,
408.04	the fleeting moment of human connection,
410.36	transformed how I was feeling,
412.76	making me want to keep going.
415.76	My existence was tortured by monotony,
418.72	a reality that was often too much to bear.
421.76	Alone with my thoughts,
421.76	I constructed intricate fantasies
425.92	about ants running across the floor.
429.32	I taught myself to tell the time
429.32	by noticing where the shadows were.
434.44	As I learned how the shadows moved
434.44	as the hours of the day passed,
438.6	I understood how long it would be
438.6	before I was picked up and taken home.
443.28	Seeing my father walk
443.28	through the door to collect me
446.56	was the best moment of the day.
449.6	My mind became a tool that I could use
451.96	to either close down
451.96	to retreat from my reality
454.8	or enlarge into a gigantic space
454.8	that I could fill with fantasies.
459.8	I hoped that my reality would change
461.8	and someone would see
461.8	that I had come back to life.
464.68	But I had been washed away
464.68	like a sand castle
467.4	built too close to the waves,
469.56	and in my place was the person
469.56	people expected me to be.
473.76	To some I was Martin,
473.76	a vacant shell, the vegetable,
477.56	deserving of harsh words,
477.56	dismissal and even abuse.
482	To others, I was the tragically
482	brain-damaged boy
484.96	who had grown to become a man.
487.2	Someone they were kind to and cared for.
490.4	Good or bad, I was a blank canvas
492.92	onto which different versions
492.92	of myself were projected.
497.16	It took someone new
497.16	to see me in a different way.
500.48	An aromatherapist began coming
500.48	to the care home about once a week.
504.76	Whether through intuition
504.76	or her attention to details
507.76	that others failed to notice,
509.8	she became convinced that I could
509.8	understand what was being said.
513.96	She urged my parents
513.96	to have me tested by experts
517.48	in augmentative
517.48	and alternative communication.
520.8	And within a year,
522.04	I was beginning to use
522.04	a computer program to communicate.
526.12	It was exhilarating,
526.12	but frustrating at times.
529.88	I had so many words in my mind,
531.88	that I couldn't wait
531.88	to be able to share them.
534.72	Sometimes, I would say things to myself
534.72	simply because I could.
539.48	In myself, I had a ready audience,
542.12	and I believed that by expressing
542.12	my thoughts and wishes,
545.28	others would listen, too.
547.04	But as I began to communicate more,
549.32	I realized that it was in fact
549.32	only just the beginning
552.52	of creating a new voice for myself.
555.48	I was thrust into a world
555.48	I didn't quite know how to function in.
559.84	I stopped going to the care home
561.52	and managed to get my first job
561.52	making photocopies.
565.4	As simple as this may sound,
565.4	it was amazing.
568.88	My new world was really exciting
570.92	but often quite overwhelming
570.92	and frightening.
573.76	I was like a man-child,
575.6	and as liberating as it often was,
577.72	I struggled.
579.48	I also learned that many of those
579.48	who had known me for a long time
583.04	found it impossible to abandon the idea
583.04	of Martin they had in their heads.
587.72	While those I had only just met
589.36	struggled to look past the image
589.36	of a silent man in a wheelchair.
594	I realized that some people
594	would only listen to me
596.76	if what I said was in line
596.76	with what they expected.
599.8	Otherwise, it was disregarded
601.84	and they did what they felt was best.
604.52	I discovered that true communication
606.56	is about more than merely
606.56	physically conveying a message.
610.4	It is about getting the message
610.4	heard and respected.
614.96	Still, things were going well.
617.24	My body was slowly getting stronger.
619.84	I had a job in computing that I loved,
622.32	and had even got Kojak, the dog
622.32	I had been dreaming about for years.
627.24	However, I longed to share
627.24	my life with someone.
631.2	I remember staring out the window
631.2	as my dad drove me home from work,
635.64	thinking I have so much love inside of me
635.64	and nobody to give it to.
640.36	Just as I had resigned myself
640.36	to being single for the rest of my life,
644.84	I met Joan.
646.64	Not only is she the best thing
646.64	that has ever happened to me,
650.12	but Joan helped me to challenge
650.12	my own misconceptions about myself.
655.04	Joan said it was through my words
655.04	that she fell in love with me.
659.68	However, after all I had been through,
662.48	I still couldn't shake the belief
664.24	that nobody could truly see
664.24	beyond my disability
667.48	and accept me for who I am.
670.08	I also really struggled
670.08	to comprehend that I was a man.
674.28	The first time someone
674.28	referred to me as a man,
677.12	it stopped me in my tracks.
679.44	I felt like looking around
679.44	"and asking, ""Who, me?"""
684.08	That all changed with Joan.
686.28	We have an amazing connection
687.88	and I learned how important it is
687.88	to communicate openly and honestly.
692.56	I felt safe, and it gave me the confidence
692.56	to truly say what I thought.
697.52	I started to feel whole again,
697.52	a man worthy of love.
701.84	I began to reshape my destiny.
704.32	I spoke up a little more at work.
706.56	I asserted my need for independence
706.56	to the people around me.
710.96	Being given a means of communication
710.96	changed everything.
714.84	I used the power of words and will
714.84	to challenge the preconceptions
719.08	of those around me
719.08	and those I had of myself.
722.68	Communication is what makes us human,
725.4	enabling us to connect
725.4	on the deepest level
727.72	with those around us --
729.68	telling our own stories,
731.28	expressing wants, needs and desires,
734.92	or hearing those of others
734.92	by really listening.
738.08	All this is how the world
738.08	knows who we are.
741.44	So who are we without it?
744.48	True communication increases understanding
747.68	and creates a more caring
747.68	and compassionate world.
751.8	Once, I was perceived
751.8	to be an inanimate object,
754.92	a mindless phantom
754.92	of a boy in a wheelchair.
758.24	Today, I am so much more.
760.52	A husband, a son, a friend,
762.96	a brother, a business owner,
762.96	a first-class honors graduate,
767.24	a keen amateur photographer.
769.6	It is my ability to communicate
769.6	that has given me all this.
774.32	We are told that actions
774.32	speak louder than words.
778.04	But I wonder,
780	do they?
782.88	Our words, however we communicate them,
785.56	are just as powerful.
787.68	Whether we speak the words
787.68	with our own voices,
790.44	type them with our eyes,
791.8	or communicate them non-verbally
791.8	to someone who speaks them for us,
796.08	words are among our most powerful tools.
800.4	I have come to you through
800.4	a terrible darkness,
803.24	pulled from it by caring souls
805.36	and by language itself.
807.72	The act of you listening to me today
807.72	brings me farther into the light.
811.76	We are shining here together.
814.08	If there is one most difficult obstacle
814.08	to my way of communicating,
818.4	it is that sometimes I want to shout
820.36	and other times simply to whisper
820.36	a word of love or gratitude.
824.68	It all sounds the same.
826.96	But if you will,
828.4	please imagine these next two words
828.4	as warmly as you can:
834.48	Thank you.
836.28	(Applause)
