27	Thank you. I have to tell you
27	I'm both challenged and excited.
30.502	My excitement is: I get a chance
30.502	to give something back.
33.438	My challenge is: the shortest seminar
33.438	I usually do is 50 hours.
37	(Laughter)
38.649	I'm not exaggerating. I do weekends --
40.903	I do more, obviously,
40.903	I also coach people --
43.162	but I'm into immersion,
43.162	because how did you learn language?
45.957	Not just by learning principles,
47.586	you got in it and you did it
47.586	so often that it became real.
50.463	The bottom line of why I'm here,
50.463	besides being a crazy mofo, is that --
53.964	I'm not here to motivate you,
53.964	you don't need that, obviously.
57.727	Often that's what people think I do,
59.774	and it's the furthest thing from it.
61.513	What happens, though, is people say to me,
63.582	"""I don't need any motivation."""
65.075	But that's not what I do.
66.641	"I'm the ""why"" guy."
68.532	I want to know why you do what you do.
70.628	What is your motive for action?
73.135	What is it that drives you
73.135	in your life today? Not 10 years ago.
76.337	Are you running the same pattern?
78.066	Because I believe that the invisible force
78.066	of internal drive, activated,
82.002	is the most important thing.
83.834	I'm here because I believe
83.834	emotion is the force of life.
87.437	All of us here have great minds.
89.278	Most of us here have great minds, right?
91.73	We all know how to think.
94.114	With our minds we can
94.114	rationalize anything.
96.227	We can make anything happen.
97.593	I agree with what was described
97.593	a few days ago,
100.395	that people work in their self-interest.
102.746	But we know that that's bullshit at times.
105.388	You don't work in your
105.388	self-interest all the time,
107.776	because when emotion comes into it,
109.667	the wiring changes
109.667	in the way it functions.
111.734	So it's wonderful to think intellectually
111.734	about how the life of the world is,
115.709	especially those who are very smart
115.709	can play this game in our head.
118.892	But I really want to know
118.892	what's driving you.
121.018	What I would like to invite you to do
122.9	by the end of this talk is explore
122.9	where you are today, for two reasons.
126.43	One: so that you can contribute more.
128.335	And two: that hopefully we can not just
128.335	understand other people more,
131.629	but appreciate them more,
131.629	and create the kinds of connections
134.543	that can stop some of the challenges
134.543	that we face today.
137.49	They're only going to get magnified
137.49	by the very technology that connects us,
141.259	because it's making us intersect.
143.069	That intersection
143.069	doesn't always create a view
145.319	"of ""everybody now understands everybody,"
147.529	"and everybody appreciates everybody."""
149.917	I've had an obsession
149.917	basically for 30 years,
152.532	"""What makes the difference"
152.532	in the quality of people's lives?
156.871	"What in their performance?"""
158.352	I got hired to produce the result now.
160.554	I've done it for 30 years.
162.074	I get the phone call
163.645	when the athlete is burning down
163.645	on national television,
166.411	and they were ahead by five strokes
168.121	and now they can't get back on the course.
170.145	I've got to do something right now
170.145	or nothing matters.
172.855	I get the phone call when the child
172.855	is going to commit suicide,
175.851	I've got to do something.
177.322	In 29 years, I'm very grateful
177.322	to tell you I've never lost one.
181	It doesn't mean I won't some day,
181	but I haven't yet.
183.528	The reason is an understanding
183.528	of these human needs.
186.928	When I get those calls
186.928	about performance, that's one thing.
190.063	How do you make a change?
191.573	I'm also looking to see what is shaping
191.573	the person's ability to contribute,
195.592	to do something beyond themselves.
199.126	Maybe the real question is,
201.258	I look at life and say
201.258	there's two master lessons.
203.653	One is: there's the science
203.653	of achievement,
205.756	which almost everyone here
205.756	has mastered amazingly.
208.55	"""How do you take the invisible"
208.55	"and make it visible,"""
211.069	How do you make your dreams happen?
212.81	Your business, your contribution
212.81	to society, money --
215.421	whatever, your body, your family.
217.157	The other lesson that is rarely
217.157	mastered is the art of fulfillment.
221.517	Because science is easy, right?
223.117	We know the rules, you write the code
223.117	and you get the results.
226.046	Once you know the game,
226.046	you just up the ante, don't you?
229.214	But when it comes
229.214	to fulfillment -- that's an art.
231.671	The reason is, it's about
231.671	appreciation and contribution.
234.891	You can only feel so much by yourself.
237	I've had an interesting laboratory
237	to try to answer the real question
240.96	how somebody's life changes
242.54	if you look at them like those people
242.54	that you've given everything to?
245.875	Like all the resources they say they need.
248.023	You gave not a 100-dollar computer,
248.023	but the best computer.
250.833	You gave them love, joy,
250.833	were there to comfort them.
253.379	Those people very often --
253.379	you know some of them --
255.999	end up the rest of their life
257.464	with all this love, education,
257.464	money and background
259.913	going in and out of rehab.
262	Some people have been
262	through ultimate pain,
265	psychologically, sexually,
265	spiritually, emotionally abused --
268.399	and not always, but often,
270.079	they become some of the people
270.079	that contribute the most to society.
273.307	The question we've got to ask
273.307	ourselves really is, what is it?
277.263	What is it that shapes us?
278.63	We live in a therapy culture.
280.265	Most of us don't do that,
280.265	but the culture's a therapy culture,
283.331	the mindset that we are our past.
285.344	And you wouldn't be in this room
285.344	if you bought that,
288	but most of society
288	thinks biography is destiny.
291.202	The past equals the future.
292.869	Of course it does if you live there.
294.608	But what we know and what
294.608	we have to remind ourselves --
297.3	because you can know
297.3	something intellectually
299.518	and then not use it, not apply it.
301.92	We've got to remind ourselves
301.92	that decision is the ultimate power.
305.652	When you ask people,
308.38	have you failed to achieve
308.38	something significant in your life?
312.277	"Say, ""Aye."" Audience: Aye."
314	TR: Thanks for the interaction
314	on a high level there.
317	But if you ask people,
317	why didn't you achieve something?
320	Somebody who's working for you,
320	or a partner, or even yourself.
323.279	When you fail to achieve,
323.279	what's the reason people say?
326.399	What do they tell you?
327.566	Didn't have the knowledge,
327.566	didn't have the money,
331.899	didn't have the time,
331.899	didn't have the technology.
336.16	I didn't have the right manager.
338.018	Al Gore: Supreme Court.
338.018	TR: The Supreme Court.
340.731	(Laughter)
342.985	(Applause) (Cheering)
355	(Applause continues)
357	TR: And --
358.079	(Applause)
361.001	What do all those, including
361.001	the Supreme Court, have in common?
364.121	(Laughter)
365.519	They are a claim to you missing
365.519	resources, and they may be accurate.
370.343	You may not have the money,
370.343	or the Supreme Court,
373	but that is not the defining factor.
375	(Applause) (Laughter)
381	And you correct me if I'm wrong.
383.714	The defining factor is never resources;
383.714	it's resourcefulness.
387	And what I mean specifically,
387	rather than just some phrase,
389.828	is if you have emotion, human emotion,
393.064	something that I experienced from you
393.064	the day before yesterday
397.117	at a level that is as profound
397.117	as I've ever experienced
399.732	and I believe with that emotion
399.732	you would have beat his ass and won.
402.994	Audience: Yeah!
404.075	(Applause) (Cheering)
408.766	How easy for me to tell him
408.766	what he should do.
411	(Laughter)
413	Idiot, Robbins.
415.911	But I know when we watched
415.911	the debate at that time,
421.191	there were emotions
421.191	that blocked people's ability
423.502	to get this man's intellect and capacity.
425.503	And the way that it came across
425.503	to some people on that day --
428.423	because I know people that wanted
428.423	to vote in your direction and didn't,
431.822	and I was upset.
433.189	But there was emotion there.
434.652	Do you know what I'm talking about?
436.381	"Say, ""Aye."" Audience: Aye."
437.739	TR: So, emotion is it.
438.903	And if we get the right emotion,
438.903	we can get ourselves to do anything.
442.677	If you're creative, playful, fun enough,
444.621	can you get through to anybody, yes or no?
446.715	If you don't have the money,
448.183	but you're creative and determined,
448.183	you find the way.
450.736	This is the ultimate resource.
452.243	But this is not the story
452.243	that people tell us.
454.5	They tell us a bunch of different stories.
456.6	They tell us we don't have
456.6	the resources, but ultimately,
459.333	if you take a look here,
460.921	they say, what are all the reasons
460.921	they haven't accomplished that?
464.287	He's broken my pattern,
464.287	that son-of-a-bitch.
466.572	(Laughter)
469.923	But I appreciated the energy,
469.923	I'll tell you that.
472.301	(Laughter)
473.402	What determines your resources?
474.943	We've said decisions shape destiny,
474.943	which is my focus here.
478.104	If decisions shape destiny,
478.104	what determines it is three decisions.
481.224	What will you focus on?
482.401	You have to decide
482.401	what you're going to focus on.
484.876	Consciously or unconsciously.
486.361	the minute you decide to focus,
486.361	you must give it a meaning,
489.296	and that meaning produces emotion.
491.209	Is this the end or the beginning?
493.059	Is God punishing me or rewarding me,
493.059	or is this the roll of the dice?
496.982	An emotion creates
496.982	what we're going to do, or the action.
500	So, think about your own life,
502	the decisions that
502	have shaped your destiny.
504.072	And that sounds really heavy,
504.072	but in the last five or 10 years,
507.082	have there been some decisions
508.653	that if you'd made a different decision,
508.653	your life would be completely different?
512.514	How many can think about it?
512.514	"Better or worse. Say, ""Aye."""
515.232	Audience: Aye.
516.288	So the bottom line is,
516.288	maybe it was where to go to work,
518.976	and you met the love of your life there,
518.976	a career decision.
521.853	I know the Google geniuses I saw here --
523.843	I mean, I understand that their decision
523.843	was to sell their technology.
527.255	What if they made that decision
527.255	versus to build their own culture?
530.42	How would the world or their lives
530.42	be different, their impact?
533.373	The history of our world
533.373	is these decisions.
535.514	When a woman stands up and says,
535.514	"""No, I won't go to the back of the bus."""
539.1	She didn't just affect her life.
539.1	That decision shaped our culture.
542.643	Or someone standing in front of a tank.
545.186	Or being in a position
545.186	like Lance Armstrong,
548	"""You've got testicular cancer."""
549.568	That's pretty tough for any male,
549.568	especially if you ride a bike.
552.631	(Laughter)
554	You've got it in your brain;
554	you've got it in your lungs.
556.733	But what was his decision
556.733	of what to focus on?
558.949	Different than most people.
558.949	What did it mean?
561.112	It wasn't the end; it was the beginning.
563.087	He goes off and wins
563.087	seven championships he never once won
565.902	before the cancer, because he got
565.902	emotional fitness, psychological strength.
569.808	That's the difference
569.808	in human beings that I've seen
572.323	of the three million I've been around.
574.206	In my lab, I've had three million people
574.206	from 80 countries over the last 29 years.
580.015	And after a while,
580.015	patterns become obvious.
582.503	You see that South America and Africa
582.503	may be connected in a certain way, right?
586.526	"Others say, ""Oh, that sounds"
586.526	"ridiculous."" It's simple."
589.168	So, what shaped Lance? What shapes you?
591.476	Two invisible forces.
591.476	Very quickly. One: state.
595.822	We all have had times,
597	you did something, and after,
597	you thought to yourself,
599.817	"""I can't believe I said or did that,"
599.817	"that was so stupid."""
603	"Who's been there? Say, ""Aye."""
603	Audience: Aye.
605.119	Or after you did something,
605.119	"you go, ""That was me!"""
607.539	(Laughter)
609	It wasn't your ability; it was your state.
611.858	Your model of the world
611.858	is what shapes you long term.
614.802	Your model of the world is the filter.
614.802	That's what's shaping us.
618.358	It makes people make decisions.
619.982	To influence somebody, we need to know
619.982	what already influences them.
623.262	It's made up of three parts.
625.095	First, what's your target?
625.095	What are you after?
627.458	It's not your desires.
629	You can get your desires or goals.
630.659	Who has ever got a goal or desire
630.659	and thought, is this all there is?
633.897	"Say, ""Aye."" Audience: Aye."
635.174	It's needs we have. I believe
635.174	there are six human needs.
638.066	Second, once you know what the target
638.066	that's driving you is
641	and you uncover it for the truth --
641	you don't form it --
644	then you find out what's your map,
645.759	what's the belief systems
645.759	that tell you how to get those needs.
648.844	Some people think the way
648.844	to get them is to destroy the world,
651.819	some people, to build,
651.819	create something, love someone.
654.393	There's the fuel you pick.
654.393	So very quickly, six needs.
657	Let me tell you what they are.
657	First one: certainty.
659.495	These are not goals or desires,
659.495	these are universal.
661.982	Everyone needs certainty
661.982	they can avoid pain
664.106	and at least be comfortable.
665.547	Now, how do you get it?
666.825	Control everybody? Develop a skill?
666.825	Give up? Smoke a cigarette?
669.934	And if you got totally
669.934	certain, ironically,
672	even though we need that --
673.31	you're not certain about your health,
673.31	or your children, or money.
676.527	If you're not sure
676.527	the ceiling will hold up,
678.766	you won't listen to any speaker.
680.409	While we go for certainty differently,
680.409	if we get total certainty, we get what?
684.182	What do you feel if you're certain?
685.9	You know what will happen,
685.9	when and how it will happen,
688.577	what would you feel?
689.7	Bored out of your minds.
689.7	So, God, in Her infinite wisdom,
692.4	gave us a second human need,
692.4	which is uncertainty.
695	We need variety. We need surprise.
698	How many of you here
698	"love surprises? Say, ""Aye."""
700.32	Audience: Aye.
701.425	TR: Bullshit. You like
701.425	the surprises you want.
704.06	The ones you don't want,
704.06	you call problems, but you need them.
707.428	So, variety is important.
709.231	Have you ever rented a video
709.231	or a film that you've already seen?
712.367	Who's done this? Get a fucking life.
714.2	(Laughter)
716	Why are you doing it?
717.634	You're certain it's good
717.634	because you read or saw it before,
720.441	but you're hoping it's been
720.441	long enough you've forgotten,
723.159	and there's variety.
724.2	Third human need, critical: significance.
726.26	We all need to feel important,
726.26	special, unique.
728.559	You can get it by making more money
728.559	or being more spiritual.
731.45	You can do it by getting yourself
731.45	in a situation where you put
734.39	more tattoos and earrings in places
734.39	humans don't want to know.
737.4	Whatever it takes.
738.489	The fastest way to do this,
739.8	if you have no background,
739.8	no culture, no belief and resources
742.8	or resourcefulness, is violence.
744.463	If I put a gun to your head and I live
744.463	in the 'hood, instantly I'm significant.
748.247	Zero to 10. How high? 10.
749.732	How certain am I that
749.732	you're going to respond to me? 10.
752.842	How much uncertainty?
753.982	Who knows what's going to happen next?
753.982	Kind of exciting.
756.7	Like climbing up into a cave
756.7	and doing that stuff
759.1	all the way down there.
760.404	Total variety and uncertainty.
761.89	And it's significant, isn't it?
761.89	So you want to risk your life for it.
765.3	So that's why violence has always
765.3	been around and will be around
768.4	unless we have a consciousness
768.4	change as a species.
770.881	You can get significance a million ways,
772.9	but to be significant, you've got
772.9	to be unique and different.
775.823	Here's what we really need:
775.823	connection and love, fourth need.
778.829	We all want it;
779.9	most settle for connection,
779.9	love's too scary.
782.103	Who here has been hurt
782.103	in an intimate relationship?
784.604	If you don't raise your hand,
784.604	you've had other shit, too.
787.46	And you're going to get hurt again.
789.207	Aren't you glad you came
789.207	to this positive visit?
791.491	Here's what's true: we need it.
793.035	We can do it through
793.035	intimacy, friendship, prayer,
796.435	through walking in nature.
797.806	If nothing else works for you,
797.806	don't get a cat, get a dog,
800.662	because if you leave for two minutes,
800.662	it's like you've been gone six months,
804.281	when you come back 5 minutes later.
806.011	These first four needs,
806.011	every human finds a way to meet.
808.69	Even if you lie to yourself,
808.69	you need to have split personalities.
811.924	I call the first four needs
811.924	the needs of the personality.
816.487	The last two are the needs of the spirit.
819.245	And this is where fulfillment comes.
821.036	You won't get it from the first four.
822.855	You'll figure a way, smoke, drink,
822.855	do whatever, meet the first four.
826.165	But number five, you must grow.
827.765	We all know the answer.
828.918	If you don't grow, you're what?
830.465	If a relationship or business
830.465	is not growing,
832.598	if you're not growing,
833.759	doesn't matter how much
833.759	money or friends you have,
836.186	how many love you,
837.386	you feel like hell.
838.653	And I believe the reason we grow
840.268	is so we have something to give of value.
842.252	Because the sixth need
842.252	is to contribute beyond ourselves.
844.987	Because we all know, corny as that sounds,
847.088	the secret to living is giving.
848.698	We all know life is not about me,
848.698	it's about we.
851.006	This culture knows that,
851.006	this room knows that.
853.269	It's exciting.
854.37	When you see Nicholas
854.37	talking about his $100 computer,
856.988	the most exciting thing is:
858.351	here's a genius,
858.351	but he's got a calling now.
860.79	You can feel the difference in him,
860.79	and it's beautiful.
863.686	And that calling can touch other people.
865.653	My life was touched
865.653	because when I was 11 years old,
868.554	Thanksgiving, no money, no food,
870.565	we were not going to starve,
872	but my father was totally messed up,
873.739	my mom was letting him know
873.739	how bad he messed up,
876.094	and somebody came to the door
876.094	and delivered food.
878.473	My father made three decisions,
878.473	I know what they were, briefly.
881.557	"His focus was ""This is charity."
883.406	What does it mean? I'm worthless.
885.096	What do I have to do?
885.096	"Leave my family,"" which he did."
887.745	It was one of the most painful
887.745	experiences of life.
890.251	My three decisions
890.251	gave me a different path.
892.796	"I set focus on ""There's food."""
892.796	What a concept!
896.142	(Laughter)
897.243	But this is what changed my life,
897.243	shaped me as a human being.
900.462	Somebody's gift,
900.462	I don't even know who it is.
902.679	My father always said,
902.679	"""No one gives a shit."""
905.825	And now somebody I don't know,
907.323	they're not asking for anything,
907.323	just giving us food,
909.881	looking out for us.
911.082	It made me believe this:
911.082	that strangers care.
914.627	And that made me decide,
915.883	if strangers care about me and my family,
915.883	I care about them.
918.974	I'm going to do something
918.974	to make a difference.
921.214	So when I was 17,
921.214	I went out on Thanksgiving,
923.335	it was my target for years to have
923.335	enough money to feed two families.
926.612	The most fun and moving thing
926.612	I ever did in my life.
929.101	Next year, I did four, then eight.
930.808	I didn't tell anybody what I was doing,
930.808	I wasn't doing it for brownie points.
934.567	But after eight,
934.567	I thought I could use some help.
936.977	So I went out, got my friends involved,
939.429	then I grew companies, got 11,
939.429	and I built the foundation.
943.848	I'm proud to tell you last year we fed
943.848	2 million people in 35 countries
947.318	through our foundation.
948.526	All during the holidays,
948.526	Thanksgiving, Christmas,
950.883	in different countries around the world.
952.91	(Applause)
954.035	Thank you.
955.205	I don't tell you that to brag,
955.205	but because I'm proud of human beings
958.801	because they get excited to contribute
960.732	once they've had the chance
960.732	to experience it, not talk about it.
963.865	So, finally -- I'm about out of time.
965.68	The target that shapes you --
968.563	Here's what's different about people.
970.446	We have the same needs.
971.655	But are you a certainty freak,
971.655	is that what you value most,
974.546	or uncertainty?
975.747	This man couldn't be a certainty freak
975.747	if he climbed through those caves.
979.312	Are you driven by significance or love?
981.217	We all need all six,
982.517	but what your lead system is
982.517	tilts you in a different direction.
985.625	And as you move in a direction,
985.625	you have a destination or destiny.
988.785	The second piece is the map.
990.234	The operating system
990.234	tells you how to get there,
992.534	and some people's map is,
993.839	"""I'm going to save lives"
993.839	"even if I die for other people,"""
996.634	and they're a fireman,
997.834	and somebody else says,
997.834	"""I'm going to kill people to do it."""
1000.774	They're trying to meet
1000.774	the same needs of significance.
1003.376	They want to honor God
1003.376	or honor their family.
1005.593	But they have a different map.
1007.139	And there are seven different beliefs;
1007.139	I can't go through them, because I'm done.
1011.042	The last piece is emotion.
1012.395	One of the parts of the map is like time.
1014.42	Some people's idea
1014.42	of a long time is 100 years.
1016.733	Somebody else's is three seconds,
1016.733	which is what I have.
1019.432	And the last one I've already mentioned
1019.432	that fell to you.
1022.227	If you've got a target and a map --
1023.974	I can't use Google because I love Macs,
1025.931	and they haven't made it
1025.931	good for Macs yet.
1028.051	So if you use MapQuest --
1029.356	how many have made
1029.356	this fatal mistake of using it?
1031.795	You use this thing
1031.795	and you don't get there.
1033.915	Imagine if your beliefs guarantee
1033.915	you can never get to where you want to go.
1037.575	(Laughter)
1038.676	The last thing is emotion.
1040.034	Here's what I'll tell you about emotion.
1042.062	There are 6,000 emotions
1043.561	that we have words for
1043.561	in the English language,
1045.874	which is just a linguistic representation
1045.874	that changes by language.
1049.054	But if your dominant emotions --
1051.378	If I have 20,000 people or 1,000
1054.129	and I have them write down
1054.129	all the emotions that they experience
1057.205	in an average week,
1058.23	and I give them as long as they need,
1060.184	and on one side
1060.184	they write empowering emotions,
1062.497	the other's disempowering,
1063.836	guess how many emotions
1063.836	they experience? Less than 12.
1066.387	And half of those
1066.387	make them feel like shit.
1068.507	They have six good feelings.
1069.956	Happy, happy, excited, oh shit,
1071.62	frustrated, frustrated,
1071.62	overwhelmed, depressed.
1073.887	How many of you know somebody
1075.384	who, no matter what happens,
1075.384	finds a way to get pissed off?
1078.179	(Laughter)
1079.383	Or no matter what happens,
1079.383	they find a way to be happy or excited.
1083.748	How many of you know somebody like this?
1085.776	When 9/11 happened, I'll finish
1085.776	with this, I was in Hawaii.
1089.04	I was with 2,000 people from 45 countries,
1091.433	we were translating
1091.433	four languages simultaneously
1093.843	for a program I was conducting,
1093.843	for a week.
1096.275	The night before was called
1096.275	Emotional Mastery.
1098.54	I got up, had no plan
1098.54	for this, and I said --
1100.949	we had fireworks,
1100.949	I do crazy shit, fun stuff,
1104.071	and at the end, I stopped.
1105.376	I had this plan, but I never know
1105.376	what I'm going to say.
1108.123	And all of a sudden, I said,
1109.572	"""When do people really start to live?"
1109.572	"When they face death."""
1112.644	And I went through this whole thing
1114.376	about, if you weren't going
1114.376	to get off this island,
1116.882	if nine days from now,
1116.882	you were going to die,
1119.099	who would you call,
1119.099	what would you say, what would you do?
1121.942	That night is when 9/11 happened.
1123.634	One woman had come to the seminar,
1123.634	and when she came there,
1126.524	her previous boyfriend had been
1126.524	kidnapped and murdered.
1129.223	Her new boyfriend wanted to marry her,
1129.223	and she said no.
1131.922	"He said, ""If you go to that Hawaii thing,"
1131.922	"it's over with us."""
1135.303	"She said, ""It's over."""
1136.563	When I finished that night,
1136.563	she called him and left a message
1139.552	at the top of the World Trade Center
1139.552	where he worked, saying,
1142.54	"""I love you, I want you to know"
1142.54	I want to marry you.
1145.093	"It was stupid of me."""
1146.521	She was asleep, because it was 3 a.m.
1146.521	for us, when he called her back,
1149.943	"and said, ""Honey, I can't tell you"
1149.943	what this means.
1152.847	I don't know how to tell you this,
1152.847	but you gave me the greatest gift,
1156.22	"because I'm going to die."""
1158.164	And she played the recording
1158.164	for us in the room.
1160.526	She was on Larry King later.
1161.975	"And he said, ""You're probably wondering"
1163.955	how on Earth this could
1163.955	happen to you twice.
1166.071	All I can say is this must be
1166.071	God's message to you.
1168.577	From now on, every day,
1168.577	give your all, love your all.
1171.132	"Don't let anything ever stop you."""
1173.707	She finishes, and a man
1173.707	stands up, and he says,
1175.974	"""I'm from Pakistan, I'm a Muslim."
1177.574	I'd love to hold your hand
1177.574	and say I'm sorry,
1179.791	"but frankly, this is retribution."""
1183.13	I can't tell you the rest,
1183.13	because I'm out of time.
1185.637	(Laughter)
1192.319	Are you sure?
1193.519	(Laughter)
1199.039	(Laughter and applause)
1204.342	All I can tell you is,
1205.502	I brought this man on stage
1207.133	with a man from New York who worked
1207.133	in the World Trade Center,
1210.098	because I had about 200 New Yorkers there.
1212.122	More than 50 lost
1212.122	their entire companies, friends,
1214.581	marking off their Palm Pilots.
1216.127	One financial trader,
1216.127	woman made of steel, bawling --
1220.578	"And I said, ""What are we"
1220.578	going to focus on?
1224.572	What does this mean
1224.572	"and what are we going to do?"""
1226.934	And I got the group to focus on:
1229.03	if you didn't lose somebody today,
1230.77	your focus is going to be
1230.77	how to serve somebody else.
1233.372	Then one woman stood up
1233.372	and was so angry, screaming and yelling.
1236.504	I found out she wasn't from New York,
1236.504	she's not an American,
1239.444	doesn't know anybody here.
1240.797	"I asked, ""Do you always get angry?"""
1242.583	"She said, ""Yes."""
1243.784	Guilty people got guilty,
1243.784	sad people got sad.
1246	I took these two men
1246	and I did an indirect negotiation.
1248.699	Jewish man with family
1248.699	in the occupied territory,
1251.108	someone in New York who would have died
1251.108	if he was at work that day,
1254.386	and this man who wanted to be a terrorist,
1256.51	and I made it very clear.
1257.814	This integration is on a film,
1257.814	which I'd be happy to send you,
1260.755	instead of my verbalization,
1262.205	but the two of them not only came together
1264.329	and changed their beliefs
1264.329	and models of the world,
1266.787	but worked together to bring,
1266.787	for almost four years now,
1269.533	through various mosques and synagogues,
1271.436	the idea of how to create peace.
1273.078	And he wrote a book, called
1273.078	"""My Jihad, My Way of Peace."""
1275.765	So, transformation can happen.
1277.312	My invitation to you is:
1278.56	explore your web,
1280.115	the web in here --
1281.689	the needs, the beliefs, the emotions
1281.689	that are controlling you,
1285.301	for two reasons:
1286.502	so there's more of you to give,
1286.502	and achieve, too,
1288.823	but I mean give,
1290.135	because that's what's
1290.135	going to fill you up.
1292.212	And secondly, so you can appreciate --
1294.064	not just understand,
1294.064	that's intellectual, that's the mind,
1296.907	but appreciate
1296.907	what's driving other people.
1299.029	It's the only way
1299.029	our world's going to change.
1301.294	God bless you, thank you.
1301.294	I hope this was of service.
1303.896	(Applause)
