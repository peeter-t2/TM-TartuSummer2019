12.82	I want us to start
12.82	by thinking about this device,
15.93	the phone that's very likely
15.93	in your pockets right now.
19.563	Over 40 percent of Americans 
19.563	check their phones
22.704	within five minutes
22.704	of waking up every morning.
25.958	And then they look at it
25.958	another 50 times during the day.
29.707	Grownups consider this device
29.707	to be a necessity.
34.71	But now I want you to imagine it
34.71	in the hands of a three-year-old,
39.66	and as a society, we get anxious.
42.934	Parents are very worried
44.186	that this device is going to stunt
44.186	their children's social growth;
47.69	that it's going to keep them
47.69	from getting up and moving;
50.379	that somehow,
51.775	this is going to disrupt childhood.
56.102	So, I want to challenge this attitude.
60.224	I can envision a future
62.319	where we would be excited to see
62.319	a preschooler interacting with a screen.
68.347	These screens can get kids
68.347	up and moving even more.
73.909	They have the power to tell us more
73.909	about what a child is learning
77.088	than a standardized test can.
78.959	And here's the really crazy thought:
80.939	I believe that these screens
80.939	have the power
83.772	to prompt more real-life conversations
86.505	between kids and their parents.
90.302	Now, I was perhaps
90.302	an unlikely champion for this cause.
93.612	I studied children's literature
95.597	because I was going to work
95.597	with kids and books.
98.654	But about 20 years ago,
100.779	I had an experience that shifted my focus.
104.788	I was helping lead a research study
104.788	about preschoolers and websites.
109.01	And I walked in and was assigned
109.01	a three-year-old named Maria.
112.793	Maria had actually never seen
112.793	a computer before.
116.712	So the first thing I had to do
116.712	was teach her how to use the mouse,
119.882	and when I opened up the screen,
119.882	she moved it across the screen,
125.336	and she stopped on a character
125.336	named X the Owl.
129.103	And when she did that,
130.373	the owl lifted his wing and waved at her.
134.189	Maria dropped the mouse,
134.189	pushed back from the table, leaped up
137.586	and started waving
137.586	frantically back at him.
141.814	Her connection to that character
144.09	was visceral.
145.384	This wasn't a passive screen experience.
148.948	This was a human experience.
152.176	And it was exactly appropriate
152.176	for a three-year-old.
156.82	I've now worked at PBS Kids
156.82	for more than 15 years,
160.819	and my work there is focused on
160.819	harnessing the power of technology
165.464	as a positive in children's lives.
168.15	I believe that as a society,
168.15	we're missing a big opportunity.
171.636	We're letting our fear and our skepticism
173.903	about these devices
175.36	hold us back from realizing
175.36	their potential
177.896	in our children's lives.
180.49	Fear about kids and technology
180.49	is nothing new;
183.73	we've been here before.
185.388	Over 50 years ago, the debate was raging
185.388	about the newly dominant media:
190.129	the television.
191.828	That box in the living room?
193.852	It might be separating kids
193.852	from one another.
196.522	It might keep them away
196.522	from the outside world.
200.344	But this is the moment when Fred Rogers,
203.41	the long-running host
203.41	"of ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,"""
206.517	challenged society
206.517	to look at television as a tool,
211.271	a tool that could promote
211.271	emotional growth.
214.014	Here's what he did:
215.221	he looked out from the screen,
215.221	and he held a conversation,
219.617	as if he were speaking
219.617	to each child individually
223.887	about feelings.
225.653	And then he would pause
227.883	and let them think about them.
231.091	You can see his influence
231.091	across the media landscape today,
234.783	but at the time, this was revolutionary.
238.341	He shifted the way we looked at television
238.341	in the lives of children.
244.923	Today it's not just one box.
247.594	Kids are surrounded by devices.
250.137	And I'm also a parent -- I understand
250.137	this feeling of anxiety.
255.769	But I want us to look
255.769	at three common fears
258.929	that parents have,
260.466	and see if we can shift our focus
263.334	to the opportunity that's in each of them.
266.691	So.
267.868	Fear number one:
269.77	"""Screens are passive."
271.452	This is going to keep our kids
271.452	"from getting up and moving."""
275.725	Chris Kratt and Martin Kratt
275.725	are zoologist brothers
279.252	who host a show about animals
279.252	"called ""Wild Kratts."""
282.707	And they approached the PBS team to say,
285.094	"""Can we do something with those cameras"
287.281	that are built into every device now?
289.606	Could those cameras capture
289.606	a very natural kid play pattern --
294.315	"pretending to be animals?"""
297.084	So we started with bats.
300.361	And when kids came in to play this game,
302.527	they loved seeing themselves
302.527	on-screen with wings.
306.066	But my favorite part of this,
307.733	when the game was over
307.733	and we turned off the screens?
311.049	The kids kept being bats.
312.986	They kept flying around the room,
314.947	they kept veering left and right
314.947	to catch mosquitoes.
318.556	And they remembered things.
320.991	They remembered that bats fly at night.
324.421	And they remembered that when bats sleep,
326.773	they hang upside down
326.773	and fold their wings in.
330.441	This game definitely got kids
330.441	up and moving.
333.669	But also, now when kids go outside,
336.883	do they look at a bird and think,
339.104	"""How does a bird fly"
339.104	differently than I flew
341.868	"when I was a bat?"""
344.447	The digital technology prompted
344.447	embodied learning
347.774	that kids can now take out into the world.
352.181	Fear number two:
355.747	"""Playing games on these screens"
355.747	is just a waste of time.
358.843	It's going to distract children
358.843	"from their education."""
363.827	Game developers know
365.252	that you can learn a lot
365.252	about a player's skill
367.686	by looking at the back-end data:
369.788	Where did a player pause?
372.126	Where did they make a few mistakes
372.126	before they found the right answer?
375.796	My team wanted to take that tool set
375.796	and apply it to academic learning.
381.234	Our producer in Boston, WGBH,
384.259	created a series of Curious George games
387.006	focused on math.
389.428	And researchers came in and had
395.235	They then gave all 80
395.235	of those preschoolers
397.823	a standardized math test.
400.433	We could see early on
401.628	that these games
401.628	were actually helping kids
403.78	understand some key skills.
406.208	But our partners at UCLA
406.208	wanted us to dig deeper.
410.164	They focus on data analysis
410.164	and student assessment.
414.219	And they wanted to take
414.219	that back-end game-play data
417.691	and see if they could use it
417.691	to predict a child's math scores.
421.888	So they made a neural net --
421.888	they essentially trained the computer
425.562	to use this data,
427.108	and here are the results.
428.632	This is a subset of the children's
428.632	standardized math scores.
433.244	And this
435.279	is the computer's prediction
435.279	of each child's score,
438.96	based on playing
438.96	some Curious George games.
443.508	The prediction is astonishingly accurate,
445.942	especially considering the fact
445.942	that these games weren't built
448.978	for assessment.
450.721	The team that did this study
450.721	believes that games like these
453.713	can teach us more
453.713	about a child's cognitive learning
457.422	than a standardized test can.
460.62	What if games could reduce
460.62	testing time in the classroom?
464.819	What if they could reduce testing anxiety?
468.42	How could they give teachers
468.42	snapshots of insight
471.869	to help them better focus
471.869	their individualized learning?
477.967	So the third fear I want to address
480.896	is the one that I think
480.896	is often the biggest.
483.904	And that's this:
485.911	"""These screens are isolating me"
485.911	"from my child."""
490.831	Let's play out a scenario.
492.966	Let's say that you are a parent,
495.703	and you need 25 minutes
495.703	of uninterrupted time
498.725	to get dinner ready.
500.307	And in order to do that,
500.307	you hand a tablet to your three-year-old.
503.99	Now, this is a moment
503.99	where you probably feel very guilty
506.991	about what you just did.
509.565	But now imagine this:
511.589	Twenty minutes later,
511.589	you receive a text message.
514.663	on that cell phone
514.663	that's always within arm's reach.
517.661	"And it says: ""Alex just matched"
517.661	five rhyming words.
522.223	Ask him to play this game with you.
524.09	Can you think of a word
524.09	that rhymes with 'cat'?
527.763	"Or how about 'ball'?"""
530.617	In our studies, when parents receive
530.617	simple tips like these,
534.368	they felt empowered.
536.037	They were so excited
537.671	to play these games
537.671	at the dinner table with their kids.
540.319	And the kids loved it, too.
541.945	Not only did it feel like magic
541.945	that their parents knew
544.884	what they had been playing,
546.471	kids love to play games
546.471	with their parents.
550.996	Just the act of talking to kids
550.996	about their media
554.951	can be incredibly powerful.
557.649	Last summer, Texas Tech University
557.649	published a study
560.998	"that the show ""Daniel Tiger's"
560.998	"Neighborhood"" could promote"
564.384	the development of empathy among children.
567.8	But there was a really important
567.8	catch to this study:
570.623	the greatest benefit was only
570.623	when parents talked to kids
575.104	about what they watched.
577.014	Neither just watching
579.038	nor just talking about it was enough;
581.062	it was the combination that was key.
585.034	So when I read this study,
586.511	I started thinking about
587.939	how rarely parents of preschoolers
587.939	actually talk to kids about the content
593.216	of what they're playing
593.216	and what they're watching.
595.626	And so I decided to try it
595.626	with my four-year-old.
598.113	I said,
599.897	"""Were you playing a car game"
599.897	"earlier today?"""
603.172	And Benjamin perked up and said,
605.178	"""Yes! And did you see"
605.178	that I made my car out of a pickle?
609.047	"It was really hard to open the trunk."""
611.158	(Laughter)
612.84	This hilarious conversation
612.84	about what was fun in the game
616.949	and what could have been better
618.484	continued all the way
618.484	to school that morning.
624.16	I'm not here to suggest to you
624.16	that all digital media is great for kids.
629.759	There are legitimate reasons
629.759	for us to be concerned
632.469	about the current state
632.469	of children's content
634.952	on these screens.
636.882	And it's right for us
636.882	to be thinking about balance:
639.681	Where do screens fit
639.681	against all the other things
643.365	that a child needs to do
643.365	to learn and to grow?
648.078	But when we fixate on our fears about it,
650.909	we forget a really major point,
653.717	and that is, that kids are living
653.717	in the same world that we live in,
657.939	the world where the grownups
657.939	check their phones
660.648	more than 50 times a day.
663.706	Screens are a part of children's lives.
667.868	And if we pretend that they aren't,
670.892	or if we get overwhelmed by our fear,
673.911	kids are never going to learn
673.911	how and why to use them.
679.725	What if we start raising our expectations
683.014	for this media?
684.945	What if we start talking to kids regularly
687.242	about the content on these screens?
689.911	What if we start looking
689.911	for the positive impacts
693.494	that this technology can have
693.494	in our children's lives?
698.042	That's when the potential of these tools
698.042	can become a reality.
703.164	Thank you.
704.383	(Applause)
