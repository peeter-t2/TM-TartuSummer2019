12.717	I'd like to take you on the epic quest
12.717	of the Rosetta spacecraft.
17.514	To escort and land the probe on a comet,
21.54	this has been my passion
21.54	for the past two years.
25.45	In order to do that,
26.545	I need to explain to you something
26.545	about the origin of the solar system.
30.015	When we go back
30.015	four and a half billion years,
32.238	there was a cloud of gas and dust.
33.957	In the center of this cloud,
33.957	our sun formed and ignited.
38.484	Along with that, what we now know
38.484	as planets, comets and asteroids formed.
44.195	What then happened, according to theory,
47.608	is that when the Earth had cooled down
47.608	a bit after its formation,
51.625	comets massively impacted the Earth
51.625	and delivered water to Earth.
57.082	They probably also delivered
57.082	complex organic material to Earth,
61.516	and that may have bootstrapped
61.516	the emergence of life.
64.906	You can compare this to having
64.906	to solve a 250-piece puzzle
68.366	and not a 2,000-piece puzzle.
71.57	Afterwards, the big planets
71.57	like Jupiter and Saturn,
75.053	they were not in their place
75.053	where they are now,
77.631	and they interacted gravitationally,
80.278	and they swept the whole interior
80.278	of the solar system clean,
83.83	and what we now know as comets
85.432	ended up in something
85.432	called the Kuiper Belt,
87.545	which is a belt of objects
87.545	beyond the orbit of Neptune.
91.213	And sometimes these objects
91.213	run into each other,
94.906	and they gravitationally deflect,
97.971	and then the gravity of Jupiter
97.971	pulls them back into the solar system.
102.428	And they then become the comets
102.428	as we see them in the sky.
106.12	The important thing here to note
106.12	is that in the meantime,
109.394	the four and a half billion years,
111.693	these comets have been sitting
111.693	on the outside of the solar system,
114.875	and haven't changed --
116.29	deep, frozen versions of our solar system.
119.193	In the sky, they look like this.
121.282	We know them for their tails.
123.233	There are actually two tails.
124.904	One is a dust tail,
124.904	which is blown away by the solar wind.
128.759	The other one is an ion tail,
128.759	which is charged particles,
132.404	and they follow the magnetic field
132.404	in the solar system.
135.143	There's the coma,
136.292	and then there is the nucleus,
136.292	which here is too small to see,
139.199	and you have to remember
139.199	that in the case of Rosetta,
141.689	the spacecraft is in that center pixel.
143.866	We are only 20, 30, 40 kilometers
143.866	away from the comet.
147.976	So what's important to remember?
150.297	Comets contain the original material
150.297	from which our solar system was formed,
155.166	so they're ideal to study the components
157.526	that were present at the time 
157.526	when Earth, and life, started.
161.791	Comets are also suspected
163.673	of having brought the elements
163.673	which may have bootstrapped life.
167.944	In 1983, ESA set up
167.944	its long-term Horizon 2000 program,
172.309	which contained one cornerstone,
172.309	which would be a mission to a comet.
176.233	In parallel, a small mission to a comet,
176.233	what you see here, Giotto, was launched,
181.123	and in 1986, flew by the comet of Halley
181.123	with an armada of other spacecraft.
187.329	From the results of that mission,
187.329	it became immediately clear
190.9	that comets were ideal bodies to study
190.9	to understand our solar system.
196.087	And thus, the Rosetta mission
196.087	was approved in 1993,
200.599	and originally it was supposed
200.599	to be launched in 2003,
204.234	but a problem arose
204.234	with an Ariane rocket.
206.858	However, our P.R. department,
206.858	in its enthusiasm,
209.923	had already made
209.923	1,000 Delft Blue plates
212.145	with the name of the wrong comets.
214.535	So I've never had to buy any china since.
214.535	That's the positive part.
218.102	(Laughter)
219.821	Once the whole problem was solved,
221.701	we left Earth in 2004
224.882	to the newly selected comet,
224.882	Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
227.97	This comet had to be specially selected
230.826	because A, you have to
230.826	be able to get to it,
233.48	and B, it shouldn't have been
233.48	in the solar system too long.
236.261	This particular comet has been 
236.261	in the solar system since 1959.
240.208	That's the first time
240.208	when it was deflected by Jupiter,
243.523	and it got close enough
243.523	to the sun to start changing.
246.5	So it's a very fresh comet.
248.611	Rosetta made a few historic firsts.
251.502	It's the first satellite to orbit a comet,
254.018	and to escort it throughout
254.018	its whole tour through the solar system --
257.64	closest approach to the sun,
257.64	as we will see in August,
260.938	and then away again to the exterior.
263.259	It's the first ever landing on a comet.
265.86	We actually orbit the comet
265.86	using something which is not
269.552	normally done with spacecraft.
271.001	Normally, you look at the sky and you know
271.001	where you point and where you are.
274.636	In this case, that's not enough.
276.772	We navigated by looking
276.772	at landmarks on the comet.
280.07	We recognized features --
280.07	boulders, craters --
282.545	and that's how we know where we are
282.545	respective to the comet.
286.562	And, of course, it's the first satellite
286.562	to go beyond the orbit of Jupiter
291.091	on solar cells.
292.292	Now, this sounds more heroic
292.292	than it actually is,
294.619	because the technology
294.619	to use radio isotope thermal generators
299.715	wasn't available in Europe at that time,
299.715	so there was no choice.
303.013	But these solar arrays are big.
304.59	This is one wing, and these are not
304.59	specially selected small people.
307.865	They're just like you and me.
309.699	(Laughter)
312.09	We have two of these wings,
316.291	Now later on, of course,
316.291	when we got to the comet,
319.31	you find out that 65 square meters of sail
322.839	close to a body which is outgassing
322.839	is not always a very handy choice.
328.481	Now, how did we get to the comet?
330.525	Because we had to go there
330.525	for the Rosetta scientific objectives
334.193	very far away -- four times the distance
334.193	of the Earth to the sun --
338.001	and also at a much higher velocity
338.001	than we could achieve with fuel,
342.111	because we'd have to take six times as
342.111	much fuel as the whole spacecraft weighed.
346.43	So what do you do?
347.84	You use gravitational flybys, slingshots,
351.323	where you pass by a planet
351.323	at very low altitude,
354.69	a few thousand kilometers,
356.455	and then you get the velocity
356.455	of that planet around the sun for free.
361.168	We did that a few times.
363.211	We did Earth, we did Mars,
363.211	we did twice Earth again,
365.69	and we also flew by two asteroids,
365.69	Lutetia and Steins.
370.318	Then in 2011, we got so far from the sun
370.318	that if the spacecraft got into trouble,
374.983	we couldn't actually
374.983	save the spacecraft anymore,
378.792	so we went into hibernation.
380.765	Everything was switched off
380.765	except for one clock.
384.103	Here you see in white the trajectory,
384.103	and the way this works.
387.614	You see that from
387.614	the circle where we started,
390.057	the white line, actually you get
390.057	more and more and more elliptical,
393.873	and then finally we approached the comet
396.822	in May 2014, and we had to start
396.822	doing the rendezvous maneuvers.
401.187	On the way there, we flew by Earth and we
401.187	took a few pictures to test our cameras.
405.784	This is the moon rising over Earth,
407.962	and this is what we now call a selfie,
409.917	which at that time, by the way,
409.917	that word didn't exist. (Laughter)
413.609	It's at Mars. It was taken
413.609	by the CIVA camera.
416.58	That's one of the cameras on the lander,
418.762	and it just looks under the solar arrays,
421.177	and you see the planet Mars
421.177	and the solar array in the distance.
425.45	Now, when we got out
425.45	of hibernation in January 2014,
431.118	we started arriving at a distance
432.903	of two million kilometers
432.903	from the comet in May.
435.736	However, the velocity
435.736	the spacecraft had was much too fast.
439.845	We were going 2,800 kilometers an hour
439.845	faster than the comet, so we had to brake.
445.906	We had to do eight maneuvers,
447.763	and you see here,
447.763	some of them were really big.
450.34	We had to brake the first one
450.34	by a few hundred kilometers per hour,
456.364	and actually, the duration of that
456.364	was seven hours,
460.674	and it used 218 kilos of fuel,
463.622	and those were seven nerve-wracking 
463.622	hours, because in 2007,
467.572	there was a leak in the system
467.572	of the propulsion of Rosetta,
470.762	and we had to close off a branch,
472.909	so the system was actually
472.909	operating at a pressure
475.487	which it was never designed
475.487	or qualified for.
479.795	Then we got in the vicinity of the comet,
479.795	and these were the first pictures we saw.
484.704	The true comet rotation period
484.704	is 12 and a half hours,
487.277	so this is accelerated,
489.366	but you will understand that
489.366	our flight dynamics engineers thought,
492.617	this is not going to be
492.617	an easy thing to land on.
496.471	We had hoped for some kind
496.471	of spud-like thing
501.115	where you could easily land.
503.281	But we had one hope: maybe it was smooth.
506.572	No. That didn't work either. (Laughter)
510.31	So at that point in time,
510.31	it was clearly unavoidable:
513.003	we had to map this body
513.003	in all the detail you could get,
516.534	because we had to find an area
516.534	which is 500 meters in diameter and flat.
521.687	Why 500 meters? That's the error
521.687	we have on landing the probe.
526.286	So we went through this process,
526.286	and we mapped the comet.
529.467	We used a technique
529.467	called photoclinometry.
531.834	You use shadows thrown by the sun.
534.064	What you see here is a rock
534.064	sitting on the surface of the comet,
537.151	and the sun shines from above.
540.077	From the shadow, we, with our brain,
542.236	can immediately determine
542.236	roughly what the shape of that rock is.
545.88	You can program that in a computer,
547.922	you then cover the whole comet,
547.922	and you can map the comet.
552.176	For that, we flew special trajectories
552.176	starting in August.
555.856	First, a triangle
555.856	of 100 kilometers on a side
558.765	at 100 kilometers' distance,
560.428	and we repeated the whole 
560.428	thing at 50 kilometers.
563.432	At that time, we had seen the comet
563.432	at all kinds of angles,
567.079	and we could use this technique
567.079	to map the whole thing.
571.752	Now, this led to a selection
571.752	of landing sites.
575.019	This whole process we had to do,
575.019	to go from the mapping of the comet
579.279	to actually finding
579.279	the final landing site, was 60 days.
582.844	We didn't have more.
584.23	To give you an idea,
584.23	the average Mars mission
586.35	takes hundreds of scientists
586.35	for years to meet
590.134	about where shall we go?
592.201	We had 60 days, and that was it.
594.359	We finally selected the final landing site
597.402	and the commands were prepared
597.402	for Rosetta to launch Philae.
602.455	The way this works is that Rosetta
602.455	has to be at the right point in space,
606.83	and aiming towards the comet,
606.83	because the lander is passive.
609.653	The lander is then pushed out
609.653	and moves towards the comet.
613.33	Rosetta had to turn around
615.12	to get its cameras to actually look
615.12	at Philae while it was departing
619.677	and to be able to communicate with it.
622.146	Now, the landing duration
622.146	of the whole trajectory was seven hours.
626.72	Now do a simple calculation:
629.507	if the velocity of Rosetta is off
629.507	by one centimeter per second,
633.546	seven hours is 25,000 seconds.
637.888	That means 252 meters wrong on the comet.
642.253	So we had to know the velocity of Rosetta
645.597	much better than
645.597	one centimeter per second,
648.104	and its location in space
648.104	better than 100 meters
652.168	at 500 million kilometers from Earth.
655.372	That's no mean feat.
657.74	Let me quickly take you through
657.74	some of the science and the instruments.
662.129	I won't bore you with all the details
662.129	of all the instruments,
665.565	but it's got everything.
667.214	We can sniff gas,
667.214	we can measure dust particles,
670.348	the shape of them, the composition,
672.6	there are magnetometers, everything.
675.108	This is one of the results from
675.108	an instrument which measures gas density
678.707	at the position of Rosetta,
680.565	so it's gas which has left the comet.
682.794	The bottom graph
682.794	is September of last year.
685.278	There is a long-term variation,
685.278	which in itself is not surprising,
688.575	but you see the sharp peaks.
690.456	This is a comet day.
692.546	You can see the effect of the sun
692.546	on the evaporation of gas
696.656	and the fact that the comet is rotating.
699.604	So there is one spot, apparently,
701.312	where there is a lot of stuff coming from,
703.459	it gets heated in the Sun,
703.459	and then cools down on the back side.
706.756	And we can see
706.756	the density variations of this.
710.262	These are the gases
710.262	and the organic compounds
714.395	that we already have measured.
716.09	You will see it's an impressive list,
717.878	and there is much, much,
717.878	much more to come,
720.362	because there are more measurements.
722.308	Actually, there is a conference
722.308	going on in Houston at the moment
725.656	where many of these results are presented.
728.827	Also, we measured dust particles.
730.448	Now, for you, this will not
730.448	look very impressive,
733.25	but the scientists were thrilled
733.25	when they saw this.
736.523	Two dust particles:
737.94	the right one they call Boris,
737.94	and they shot it with tantalum
740.934	in order to be able to analyze it.
743.048	Now, we found sodium and magnesium.
745.439	What this tells you is this is
745.439	the concentration of these two materials
749.688	at the time the solar system was formed,
752.404	so we learned things about
752.404	which materials were there
755.771	when the planet was made.
758.859	Of course, one of the important
758.859	elements is the imaging.
761.577	This is one of the cameras of Rosetta,
761.577	the OSIRIS camera,
764.943	and this actually was the cover
764.943	of Science magazine
767.938	on January 23 of this year.
770.608	Nobody had expected
770.608	this body to look like this.
774.046	Boulders, rocks -- if anything, it looks
774.046	more like the Half Dome in Yosemite
777.644	than anything else.
780.151	We also saw things like this:
782.729	dunes, and what look to be,
782.729	on the righthand side, wind-blown shadows.
787.651	Now we know these from Mars,
787.651	but this comet doesn't have an atmosphere,
791.575	so it's a bit difficult to create
791.575	a wind-blown shadow.
794.454	It may be local outgassing,
796.439	stuff which goes up and comes back.
798.622	We don't know, so there is
798.622	a lot to investigate.
801.803	Here, you see the same image twice.
803.893	On the left-hand side,
803.893	you see in the middle a pit.
806.41	On the right-hand side,
806.41	if you carefully look,
808.627	there are three jets coming out
808.627	of the bottom of that pit.
811.858	So this is the activity of the comet.
814.155	Apparently, at the bottom of these pits
814.155	is where the active regions are,
818.172	and where the material
818.172	evaporates into space.
820.935	There is a very intriguing crack
820.935	in the neck of the comet.
824.545	You see it on the right-hand side.
826.541	It's a kilometer long,
826.541	and it's two and a half meters wide.
830.237	Some people suggest that actually,
832.483	when we get close to the sun,
834.551	the comet may split in two,
836.409	and then we'll have to choose,
838.089	which comet do we go for?
840.341	The lander -- again, lots of instruments,
843.514	mostly comparable except for the things
843.514	which hammer in the ground and drill, etc.
848.855	But much the same as Rosetta, and that is
848.855	because you want to compare
852.732	what you find in space
852.732	with what you find on the comet.
856.238	These are called
856.238	ground truth measurements.
858.931	These are the landing descent images
862.162	that were taken by the OSIRIS camera.
864.21	You see the lander getting further
864.21	and further away from Rosetta.
868.436	On the top right, you see an image
868.436	taken at 60 meters by the lander,
875.1	The boulder there is some 10 meters.
877.514	So this is one of the last images we took
877.514	before we landed on the comet.
882.228	Here, you see the whole sequence again,
882.228	but from a different perspective,
885.786	and you see three blown-ups
885.786	from the bottom-left to the middle
889.971	of the lander traveling
889.971	over the surface of the comet.
894.156	Then, at the top, there is a before
894.156	and an after image of the landing.
898.342	The only problem with the after image is,
898.342	there is no lander.
902.269	But if you carefully look
902.269	at the right-hand side of this image,
905.54	we saw the lander still there, 
905.54	but it had bounced.
909.569	It had departed again.
911.23	Now, on a bit of a comical note here
914.317	is that originally Rosetta was designed
914.317	to have a lander which would bounce.
918.937	That was discarded because
918.937	it was way too expensive.
921.51	Now, we forgot, but the lander knew.
923.784	(Laughter)
925.388	During the first bounce,
925.388	in the magnetometers,
927.895	you see here the data from them,
927.895	from the three axes, x, y and z.
931.725	Halfway through, you see a red line.
933.931	At that red line, there is a change.
935.765	What happened, apparently,
935.765	is during the first bounce,
939.69	somewhere, we hit the edge of a crater
939.69	with one of the legs of the lander,
944.416	and the rotation velocity
944.416	of the lander changed.
947.236	So we've been rather lucky
949.209	that we are where we are.
951.485	This is one of
951.485	the iconic images of Rosetta.
955.154	It's a man-made object,
955.154	a leg of the lander,
959.077	standing on a comet.
961.028	This, for me, is one of the very best
961.028	images of space science I have ever seen.
966.159	(Applause)
971.34	One of the things we still have to do
971.34	is to actually find the lander.
975.191	The blue area here
975.191	is where we know it must be.
978.887	We haven't been able to find it yet,
978.887	but the search is continuing,
982.505	as are our efforts to start getting
982.505	the lander to work again.
986.27	We listen every day,
988.012	and we hope that between now
988.012	and somewhere in April,
990.57	the lander will wake up again.
992.308	The findings of what
992.308	we found on the comet:
995.795	This thing would float in water.
998.251	It's half the density of water.
1000.875	So it looks like
1000.875	a very big rock, but it's not.
1003.893	The activity increase we saw
1003.893	in June, July, August last year
1007.539	was a four-fold activity increase.
1009.93	By the time we will be at the sun,
1011.673	there will be 100 kilos
1011.673	a second leaving this comet:
1016.246	gas, dust, whatever.
1017.802	That's 100 million kilos a day.
1021.603	Then, finally, the landing day.
1023.978	I will never forget -- absolute madness,
1029.366	The BBC was interviewing me,
1031.385	and another TV crew
1031.385	who was following me all day
1034.357	were filming me being interviewed,
1036.493	and it went on like that
1036.493	for the whole day.
1038.931	The Discovery Channel crew
1040.742	actually caught me
1040.742	when leaving the control room,
1043.064	and they asked the right question,
1045.177	and man, I got into tears,
1045.177	and I still feel this.
1048.802	For a month and a half,
1050.485	I couldn't think about
1050.485	landing day without crying,
1053.319	and I still have the emotion in me.
1056.034	With this image of the comet,
1056.034	I would like to leave you.
1058.983	Thank you.
1061.096	(Applause)
