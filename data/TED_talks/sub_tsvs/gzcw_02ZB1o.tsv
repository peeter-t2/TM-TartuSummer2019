15.26	I'm going to talk today about saving more,
18.26	but not today, tomorrow.
21.26	I'm going to talk about Save More Tomorrow.
23.26	It's a program that Richard Thaler
25.26	from the University of Chicago and I
27.26	devised maybe 15 years ago.
30.26	The program, in a sense,
32.26	is an example of behavioral finance
34.26	on steroids --
36.26	how we could really use behavioral finance.
39.26	Now you might ask, what is behavioral finance?
42.26	So let's think about how we manage our money.
45.26	Let's start with mortgages.
48.26	It's kind of a recent topic,
50.26	at least in the U.S.
52.26	A lot of people buy
54.26	the biggest house they can afford,
57.26	and actually slightly bigger than that.
60.26	And then they foreclose.
63.26	And then they blame the banks
65.26	for being the bad guys who gave them the mortgages.
68.26	Let's also think about
70.26	how we manage risks --
72.26	for example, investing in the stock market.
74.26	Two years ago, three years ago, about four years ago,
77.26	markets did well.
79.26	We were risk takers, of course.
82.26	Then market stocks seize
84.26	"and we're like, ""Wow."
86.26	These losses, they feel, emotionally,
89.26	they feel very different
92.26	from what we actually thought about it
95.26	"when markets were going up."""
97.26	So we're probably not doing a great job
100.26	when it comes to risk taking.
102.26	How many of you have iPhones?
105.26	Anyone? Wonderful.
108.26	I would bet many more of you
111.26	insure your iPhone --
114.26	you're implicitly buying insurance by having an extended warranty.
117.26	What if you lose your iPhone?
119.26	What if you do this?
121.26	How many of you have kids?
123.26	Anyone?
125.26	Keep your hands up
127.26	if you have sufficient life insurance.
130.26	I see a lot of hands coming down.
132.26	I would predict,
134.26	if you're a representative sample,
136.26	that many more of you
138.26	insure your iPhones than your lives,
141.26	even when you have kids.
143.26	We're not doing that well when it comes to insurance.
146.26	The average American household
150.26	spends 1,000 dollars a year
153.26	on lotteries.
155.26	And I know it sounds crazy.
158.26	How many of you spend a thousand dollars a year on lotteries?
161.26	No one.
163.26	So that tells us that the people not in this room
166.26	are spending more than a thousand
168.26	to get the average to a thousand.
171.26	Low-income people
173.26	spend a lot more than a thousand on lotteries.
177.26	So where does it take us?
179.26	We're not doing a great job managing money.
182.26	Behavioral finance is really a combination
185.26	of psychology and economics,
187.26	trying to understand
189.26	the money mistakes people make.
191.26	And I can keep standing here
193.26	for the 12 minutes and 53 seconds that I have left
197.26	and make fun of all sorts of ways
199.26	we manage money,
201.26	"and at the end you're going to ask, ""How can we help people?"""
204.26	And that's what I really want to focus on today.
207.26	How do we take an understanding
209.26	of the money mistakes people make,
212.26	and then turning the behavioral challenges
215.26	into behavioral solutions?
217.26	And what I'm going to talk about today
219.26	is Save More Tomorrow.
221.26	I want to address the issue
223.26	of savings.
225.26	We have on the screen
227.26	a representative sample
229.26	of 100 Americans.
231.26	And we're going to look at their saving behavior.
234.26	First thing to notice is,
236.26	half of them
238.26	do not even have access
240.26	to a 401(k) plan.
242.26	They cannot make savings easy.
245.26	They cannot have money go away from their paycheck
248.26	into a 401(k) plan
250.26	before they see it,
252.26	before they can touch it.
254.26	What about the remaining half of the people?
257.26	Some of them elect not to save.
260.26	They're just too lazy.
262.26	They never get around to logging into a complicated website
265.26	and doing 17 clicks to join the 401(k) plan.
268.26	And then they have to decide how they're going to invest
270.26	in their 52 choices,
272.26	and they never heard about what is a money market fund.
276.26	And they get overwhelmed and the just don't join.
278.26	How many people end up saving to a 401(k) plan?
283.26	One third of Americans.
286.26	Two thirds are not saving now.
288.26	Are they saving enough?
290.26	Take out those
292.26	who say they save too little.
294.26	One out of 10
296.26	are saving enough.
299.26	Nine out of 10
301.26	either cannot save through their 401(k) plan,
304.26	decide not to save -- or don't decide --
307.26	or save too little.
310.26	We think we have a problem
312.26	of people saving too much.
314.26	Let's look at that.
316.26	We have one person --
318.26	well, actually we're going to slice him in half
321.26	because it's less than one percent.
324.26	Roughly half a percent of Americans
327.26	feel that they save too much.
332.26	What are we going to do about it?
334.26	That's what I really want to focus on.
336.26	We have to understand
338.26	why people are not saving,
340.26	and then we can hopefully flip
342.26	the behavioral challenges
344.26	into behavioral solutions,
346.26	and then see how powerful it might be.
349.26	So let me divert for a second
351.26	as we're going to identify the problems,
353.26	the challenges, the behavioral challenges,
356.26	that prevent people from saving.
358.26	I'm going to divert and talk about bananas and chocolate.
362.26	Suppose we had another wonderful TED event next week.
365.26	And during the break
367.26	there would be a snack
369.26	and you could choose bananas or chocolate.
371.26	How many of you think you would like to have bananas
374.26	during this hypothetical TED event next week?
376.26	Who would go for bananas?
378.26	Wonderful.
380.26	I predict scientifically
385.26	Well that's at least what one wonderful study predicted.
390.26	And then count down the days
393.26	and see what people ended up eating.
398.26	The same people that imagined themselves
401.26	eating the bananas
403.26	ended up eating chocolates
405.26	a week later.
407.26	Self-control
409.26	is not a problem in the future.
412.26	It's only a problem now
414.26	when the chocolate is next to us.
418.26	What does it have to do with time and savings,
421.26	this issue of immediate gratification?
424.26	Or as some economists call it, present bias.
428.26	We think about saving. We know we should be saving.
430.26	We know we'll do it next year, but today let us go and spend.
433.26	Christmas is coming,
435.26	we might as well buy a lot of gifts for everyone we know.
438.26	So this issue of present bias
442.26	causes us to think about saving,
444.26	but end up spending.
446.26	Let me now talk
448.26	about another behavioral obstacle to saving
450.26	having to do with inertia.
452.26	But again, a little diversion
454.26	to the topic of organ donation.
457.26	Wonderful study comparing different countries.
460.26	We're going to look at two similar countries,
463.26	Germany and Austria.
466.26	And in Germany,
468.26	if you would like to donate your organs --
470.26	God forbid something really bad
472.26	happens to you --
474.26	when you get your driving license or an I.D.,
477.26	you check the box saying,
479.26	"""I would like to donate my organs."""
481.26	Not many people like checking boxes.
483.26	It takes effort. You need to think.
485.26	Twelve percent do.
488.26	Austria, a neighboring country,
491.26	slightly similar, slightly different.
493.26	What's the difference?
495.26	Well, you still have choice.
497.26	You will decide
499.26	whether you want to donate your organs or not.
502.26	But when you get your driving license,
504.26	you check the box
506.26	if you do not want to donate your organ.
510.26	Nobody checks boxes.
512.26	That's kind of too much effort.
514.26	One percent check the box. The rest do nothing.
517.26	Doing nothing is very common.
519.26	Not many people check boxes.
522.26	What are the implications
524.26	to saving lives
526.26	and having organs available?
529.26	In Germany, 12 percent check the box.
531.26	Twelve percent are organ donors.
534.26	Huge shortage of organs,
536.26	God forbid, if you need one.
538.26	In Austria, again, nobody checks the box.
541.26	Therefore, 99 percent of people
544.26	are organ donors.
546.26	Inertia, lack of action.
548.26	What is the default setting
550.26	if people do nothing,
552.26	if they keep procrastinating, if they don't check the boxes?
555.26	Very powerful.
557.26	We're going to talk
559.26	about what happens if people are overwhelmed and scared
563.26	to make their 401(k) choices.
566.26	Are we going to make them automatically join the plan,
569.26	or are they going to be left out?
571.26	In too many 401(k) plans,
574.26	if people do nothing,
576.26	it means they're not saving for retirement,
579.26	if they don't check the box.
581.26	And checking the box takes effort.
584.26	So we've chatted about a couple of behavioral challenges.
587.26	One more before we flip the challenges into solutions,
590.26	having to do with monkeys and apples.
592.26	No, no, no, this is a real study
594.26	and it's got a lot to do with behavioral economics.
598.26	One group of monkeys gets an apple, they're pretty happy.
601.26	The other group gets two apples, one is taken away.
603.26	They still have an apple left.
605.26	They're really mad.
608.26	Why have you taken our apple?
611.26	This is the notion of loss aversion.
614.26	We hate losing stuff,
616.26	even if it doesn't mean a lot of risk.
619.26	You would hate to go to the ATM,
622.26	take out 100 dollars
624.26	and notice that you lost one of those $20 bills.
626.26	It's very painful,
628.26	even though it doesn't mean anything.
630.26	Those 20 dollars might have been a quick lunch.
634.26	So this notion of loss aversion
638.26	kicks in when it comes to savings too,
641.26	because people, mentally
643.26	and emotionally and intuitively
646.26	frame savings as a loss
648.26	because I have to cut my spending.
651.26	So we talked about
653.26	all sorts of behavioral challenges
655.26	having to do with savings eventually.
659.26	Whether you think about immediate gratification,
662.26	and the chocolates versus bananas,
665.26	it's just painful to save now.
668.26	It's a lot more fun
670.26	to spend now.
672.26	We talked about inertia and organ donations
675.26	and checking the box.
677.26	If people have to check a lot of boxes
679.26	to join a 401(k) plan,
681.26	they're going to keep procrastinating
683.26	and not join.
685.26	And last, we talked about loss aversion,
687.26	and the monkeys and the apples.
689.26	If people frame mentally
692.26	saving for retirement as a loss,
695.26	they're not going to be saving for retirement.
698.26	So we've got these challenges,
700.26	and what Richard Thaler and I
702.26	were always fascinated by --
704.26	take behavioral finance,
706.26	make it behavioral finance on steroids
708.26	or behavioral finance 2.0
710.26	or behavioral finance in action --
712.26	flip the challenges into solutions.
716.26	And we came up with an embarrassingly simple solution
719.26	called Save More, not today, Tomorrow.
723.26	How is it going to solve the challenges
725.26	we chatted about?
727.26	If you think about the problem
729.26	of bananas versus chocolates,
731.26	we think we're going to eat bananas next week.
734.26	We think we're going to save more next year.
737.26	Save More Tomorrow
740.26	invites employees
742.26	to save more maybe next year --
744.26	sometime in the future
746.26	when we can imagine ourselves
748.26	eating bananas,
750.26	volunteering more in the community,
752.26	exercising more and doing all the right things on the planet.
756.26	Now we also talked about checking the box
759.26	and the difficulty of taking action.
762.26	Save More Tomorrow
764.26	makes it easy.
766.26	It's an autopilot.
768.26	Once you tell me you would like to save more in the future,
772.26	let's say every January
774.26	you're going to be saving more automatically
777.26	and it's going to go away from your paycheck to the 401(k) plan
780.26	before you see it, before you touch it,
782.26	before you get the issue
784.26	of immediate gratification.
787.26	But what are we going to do about the monkeys
790.26	and loss aversion?
792.26	Next January comes
794.26	and people might feel that if they save more,
796.26	they have to spend less, and that's painful.
800.26	Well, maybe it shouldn't be just January.
802.26	Maybe we should make people save more
805.26	when they make more money.
808.26	That way, when they make more money, when they get a pay raise,
811.26	they don't have to cut their spending.
815.26	They take a little bit
817.26	of the increase in the paycheck home
819.26	and spend more --
821.26	take a little bit of the increase
823.26	and put it in a 401(k) plan.
825.26	So that is the program,
827.26	embarrassingly simple,
829.26	but as we're going to see,
831.26	extremely powerful.
833.26	We first implemented it,
835.26	Richard Thaler and I,
837.26	back in 1998.
840.26	Mid-sized company in the Midwest,
843.26	blue collar employees
845.26	struggling to pay their bills
847.26	repeatedly told us
849.26	they cannot save more right away.
852.26	Saving more today is not an option.
855.26	We invited them to save
857.26	three percentage points more
860.26	every time they get a pay raise.
863.26	And here are the results.
866.26	We're seeing here a three and a half-year period,
868.26	four pay raises,
870.26	people who were struggling to save,
872.26	were saving three percent of their paycheck,
874.26	three and a half years later
876.26	saving almost four times as much,
879.26	almost 14 percent.
882.26	And there's shoes and bicycles
884.26	and things on this chart
886.26	because I don't want to just throw numbers
888.26	in a vacuum.
890.26	I want, really, to think about the fact
893.26	that saving four times more
895.26	is a huge difference
897.26	in terms of the lifestyle
899.26	that people will be able to afford.
901.26	It's real.
903.26	It's not just numbers on a piece of paper.
906.26	Whereas with saving three percent,
908.26	people might have to add nice sneakers
910.26	so they can walk,
912.26	because they won't be able to afford anything else,
916.26	when they save 14 percent
918.26	they might be able to maybe have nice dress shoes
921.26	to walk to the car to drive.
924.26	This is a real difference.
926.26	By now, about 60 percent of the large companies
931.26	actually have programs like this in place.
934.26	It's been part of the Pension Protection Act.
937.26	And needless to say that Thaler and I
939.26	have been blessed to be part of this program
942.26	and make a difference.
944.26	Let me wrap
946.26	with two key messages.
949.26	One is behavioral finance
952.26	is extremely powerful.
955.26	This is just one example.
958.26	Message two
960.26	is there's still a lot to do.
962.26	This is really the tip of the iceberg.
965.26	If you think about people and mortgages
968.26	and buying houses and then not being able to pay for it,
971.26	we need to think about that.
973.26	If you're thinking about people taking too much risk
976.26	and not understanding how much risk they're taking
979.26	or taking too little risk,
981.26	we need to think about that.
983.26	If you think about people spending a thousand dollars a year
986.26	on lottery tickets,
988.26	we need to think about that.
990.26	The average actually,
992.26	the record is in Singapore.
994.26	The average household
996.26	spends $4,000 a year on lottery tickets.
999.26	We've got a lot to do,
1001.26	a lot to solve,
1003.26	also in the retirement area
1006.26	when it comes to what people do with their money
1008.26	after retirement.
1010.26	One last question:
1012.26	How many of you feel comfortable
1015.26	that as you're planning for retirement
1017.26	you have a really solid plan
1020.26	when you're going to retire,
1022.26	when you're going to claim Social Security benefits,
1025.26	what lifestyle to expect,
1027.26	how much to spend every month
1029.26	so you're not going to run out of money?
1031.26	How many of you feel you have a solid plan for the future
1034.26	when it comes to post-retirement decisions.
1039.26	One, two, three, four.
1042.26	Less than three percent
1044.26	of a very sophisticated audience.
1046.26	Behavioral finance has a long way.
1049.26	There's a lot of opportunities
1051.26	to make it powerful again and again and again.
1055.26	Thank you.
1057.26	(Applause)
