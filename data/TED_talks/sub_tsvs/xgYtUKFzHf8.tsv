13.984	Hello.
16.158	This is my first trip,
18.737	first time in life I'm outside
18.737	of the walls of Gaza.
22.999	I'm so happy to be here.
25.135	(Applause)
31.083	My ambition always was
31.083	to be a pilot, to fly a plane,
36.611	to feel free to fly the sky,
36.611	to touch the sky.
42.324	But that didn't happen.
44.216	Simply, I live in Gaza,
44.216	there is no airport.
49.133	All borders are closed on every side.
52.932	We live in one of the biggest
52.932	prisons in the world.
57.097	The only thing I can do
57.097	is just to look up to the sky.
62.44	On some days, we are lucky
62.44	if we have electricity
65.759	for four or five hours.
69.01	When it's cold, we make a fire
69.01	on the front or on the roof of our homes.
75.188	Sometimes we make food, too.
78.041	My job in Gaza is to arrange everything
78.041	for journalists who come to my homeland
83.32	to tell the stories
83.32	about what's going on in Gaza.
88.081	Many mornings,
88.081	I had to go to the border area
91.232	to collect a journalist.
92.904	If anything should happen
92.904	to the journalist,
96.189	or if the journalist decides
96.189	to cover a story
99.634	the government doesn't want us to cover,
103.356	bad things could happen.
106.733	Navigating through my country
106.733	helping journalists,
110.01	filmmakers, news crews,
110.01	is my working life.
115.607	I believe my success comes
115.607	from building a relationship
120.069	not only with journalists
120.069	and the news crews,
123.364	but also with the communities
123.364	in the Gaza Strip.
126.806	These communities who don't want
126.806	their stories to be told,
131.631	I never looked to them
131.631	as stories or numbers.
135.742	But like me, they are human beings.
141.696	I have built up
141.696	many relationships over 10 years.
146.582	And guess what?
148.134	This gives me the chance
148.134	to get access to people,
151.625	to stories that others can't.
154.265	In some certain situations,
154.265	I feel, as a woman, I have more power.
161.47	Many male journalists in my society,
164.073	they want to cover a story
164.073	about drug addiction in my country.
168.692	That problem started
168.692	when the Gaza tunnel was being built.
174.406	With the siege on Gaza,
176.617	tunnels brought people all the basic needs
179.276	like food, building material,
179.276	other stuff we needed.
182.788	But not anymore, because the Egyptian side
182.788	flooded them up with water
187.598	and they are not working anymore.
190.389	Drugs were being smuggled,
192.525	and many young people got addicted, too.
197.215	In the tradition
197.215	of the Palestinian society,
200.087	it's forbidden for men
200.087	to enter the household.
204.001	So, no male journalists get the story.
207.418	But I did.
210.898	I have a wonderful husband,
213.868	a wonderful husband who supports me
216.694	despite all the criticism
216.694	he gets from the society.
220.812	He's at home now with my two kids,
223.576	and I have another one
223.576	that's growing in here.
226.869	(Applause)
232.594	When I'm working,
232.594	I call him every two hours,
235.963	and he knows if he doesn't hear from me,
239.777	he should call my contact,
241.228	the one who gives me access to the story,
244.414	which is the one who I trust.
249.105	One of the times in Gaza,
251.154	during the kidnapping
251.154	of the British journalist Alan Johnston,
256.117	I was asked by an American magazine
260.04	to set up a meeting
260.04	with the kidnappers in Gaza, and I did.
266.014	The journalist covering the story and I
269.347	were asked to meet outside of his hotel.
273.861	They came, they picked us up
273.861	in a black van with black windows,
278.762	they were wearing masks on that day.
283.136	And they drove us away,
283.136	far away in the middle of a field.
288.971	They took our cell phones
291.455	and we did the interview
291.455	with the kidnapper outside in that field.
297.577	I was so scared that day,
299.383	a day I will never forget.
303.694	So, why do I do what I do?
307.044	I do it because I believe if I didn't,
310.387	a huge part of the story
310.387	about Gaza will be missing.
315.745	There are some more stories
315.745	I could tell you about my country.
320.15	And not all of them are bad.
322.915	I love my country, despite
322.915	the terrible situation we live in --
327.588	siege, poverty, unemployment --
331.531	but there is life.
333.644	There are people who are dreamers
333.644	and amazing people full of energy.
340.28	We have wonderful music,
340.28	and a great music school.
344.129	We have parkour dancers
344.129	who dance in the rubble of their homes.
349.6	And Gaza is the only place
349.6	in the Arab world
352.922	where Muslims and Christians
352.922	live in strong brotherhood.
358.565	(Applause)
363.684	During the time of war,
365.256	the hardest part for me
365.256	is leaving the house early in the morning,
369.352	leaving my children.
371.046	I take a picture of them everyday
375.403	because I never know
375.403	if I will make it back to them.
380.364	Being a fixer and a journalist
380.364	is difficult and dangerous in Gaza.
386.529	But when I hear the sound of the shelling
386.529	or the sound of the bombing,
390.235	I just head straight toward it,
393.197	because I want to be there first,
397.197	because these stories should be told.
403.603	When my children were small
403.603	and we heard the sound of the war,
408.376	I used to tell them
408.376	that they were fireworks.
412.238	Now they are older, they understand.
416.469	I do have terrible nightmares
419.684	because of all that I witnessed
419.684	during war times,
423.922	especially these lifeless bodies
423.922	of young children.
428.201	I still remember a little girl,
428.201	her name is Hala.
432.503	She's the only survivor from her family.
435.806	Her picture will be with me forever.
438.902	I will never forget her.
444.738	I'm proud that I can stand here
444.738	and be here today with you.
450.224	I'm proud that I can tell you
450.224	stories, sad and happy,
456.683	stories about my small corner
456.683	of the world, Gaza.
461.185	I'm proud that I am
461.185	the first female fixer working in Gaza.
466.198	And the funny thing is
466.198	they call me Mr. Rambo in Gaza.
469.852	(Laughter)
472.677	I hope one day, I will get the chance
472.677	to tell the stories of all other women,
477.65	all other amazing women
477.65	I know in my country.
481.187	I hope that one day
481.187	I can help other women in my country
485.228	to be fixers like me.
487.44	And of course sometimes,
487.44	I feel I can't do this work anymore,
491.772	it's just too much for me.
494.041	But I remember these words:
496.603	"""Don't limit your challenge,"
496.603	but challenge your limit.
500.173	Don't allow others to stand
500.173	"in front of your dreams."""
505.502	Thank you.
506.687	(Applause)
