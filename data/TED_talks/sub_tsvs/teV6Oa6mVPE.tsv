26	What I want to talk about is, as background,
29	is the idea that cars are art.
31	This is actually quite meaningful to me,
34	because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole --
38	we don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it --
41	and cars are thought so much as a product
44	that it's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side
47	under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art.
50	And so cars, as art, brings it into an emotional plane -- if you accept that --
56	that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A.
59	Now at this point you're going to see a picture of Michelangelo.
62	This is completely different than automobiles.
65	Automobiles are self-moving things, right? Elevators are automobiles.
71	And they're not very emotional; they solve a purpose;
74	and certainly automobiles have been around for 100 years
77	and have made our lives functionally a lot better in many ways;
80	they've also been a real pain in the ass,
82	because automobiles are really the thing we have to solve.
86	We have to solve the pollution, we have to solve the congestion --
89	but that's not what interests me in this speech.
92	What interests me in this speech is cars. Automobiles may be what you use,
97	but cars are what we are, in many ways.
100	And as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles,
104	and I believe we can, with fuel cells or hydrogen, like BMW is really hip on,
108	and lots of other things, then I think we can look past that
111	and try and understand why this hook is in many of us --
115	of this car-y-ness -- and what that means, what we can learn from it.
119	That's what I want to get to. Cars are not a suit of clothes;
122	cars are an avatar. Cars are an expansion of yourself:
126	they take your thoughts, your ideas, your emotions, and they multiply it --
130	your anger, whatever. It's an avatar.
133	It's a super-waldo that you happen to be inside of, and if you feel sexy,
136	the car is sexy. And if you're full of road rage,
138	"you've got a ""Chevy: Like a Rock,"" right?"
141	Cars are a sculpture -- did you know this?
144	That every car you see out there is sculpted by hand.
147	"Many people think, ""Well, it's computers,"
149	"and it's done by machines and stuff like that."""
151	Well, they reproduce it, but the originals are all done by hand.
154	It's done by men and women who believe a lot in their craft.
158	And they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car
162	that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum.
165	That tension between the need to express, the need to discover,
169	then you put something new into it,
171	and at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship.
174	Rules that say, this is how you handle surfaces;
177	this is what control is all about; this is how you show you're a master of your craft.
181	And that tension, that discovery, that push for something new --
184	and at the same time, that sense of obligation
186	to the regards of craftsmanship --
188	that's as strong in cars as it is in anything.
190	We work in clay, which hasn't changed much
192	since Michelangelo started screwing around with it,
195	and there's a very interesting analogy to that too.
198	"Real quickly -- Michelangelo once said he's there to ""discover the figure within,"" OK?"
204	There we go, the automobile.
206	That was 100 years right there -- did you catch that?
208	Between that one there, and that one there, it changed a lot didn't it?
211	OK, it's not marketing; there's a very interesting car concept here,
215	but the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here.
217	I want to talk about this.
219	Why it means you have to wash a car, what is it, that sensuality
221	you have to touch about it? That's the sculpture that goes into it. That sensuality.
226	And it's done by men and women working just like this, making cars.
231	Now this little quote about sculpture from Henry Moore,
233	"I believe that that ""pressure within"" that Moore's talking about --"
236	at least when it comes to cars --
238	comes right back to this idea of the mean.
241	It's that will to live, that need to survive, to express itself,
244	that comes in a car, and takes over people like me.
246	"And we tell other people, ""Do this, do this, do this,"" until this thing comes alive."
250	We are completely infected. And beauty can be the result
254	of this infectiousness; it's quite wonderful.
256	This sculpture is, of course, at the heart of all of it,
259	and it's really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars.
262	And it's not a whole lot different, really, when they're working like this,
266	or when somebody works like this.
268	It's that same kind of commitment, that same kind of beauty.
271	Now, now I get to the point. I want to talk about cars as art.
274	Art, in the Platonic sense, is truth; it's beauty, and love.
278	Now this is really where designers in car business diverge from the engineers.
282	We don't really have a problem talking about love.
284	We don't have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense.
287	That's what we're searching for --
289	when we're working our craft, we are really trying to find that truth out there.
292	We're not trying to find vanity and beauty.
294	We're trying to find the beauty in the truth.
296	However, engineers tend to look at things a little bit more Newtonian,
300	instead of this quantum approach.
302	We're dealing with irrationalisms,
304	and we're dealing with paradoxes that we admit exist,
306	and the engineers tend to look things a little bit more like
308	two and two is four, and if you get 4.0 it's better, and 4.000 is even better.
313	And that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence
317	in why we're doing what we're doing.
319	We've pretty much accepted the fact, though,
321	that we are the women in the organization at BMW --
323	BMW is a very manly type business, -- men, men, men; it's engineers.
326	And we're kind of the female side to that. That's OK,
329	that's cool. You go off and be manly. We're going to be a little bit more female.
332	Because what we're interested in is finding form that's more than just a function.
339	We're interested in finding beauty that's more than just an aesthetic;
342	it's really a truth.
344	And I think this idea of soul, as being at the heart of great cars,
347	is very applicable. You all know it. You know a car when you've seen it,
350	with soul. You know how strong this is.
352	Well, this experience of love, and the experience of design, to me,
356	are interchangeable. And now I'm coming to my story.
359	I discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue.
364	And first of all, you have to go with me for a second, and say,
368	"you know, you could take the word ""love"" out of a lot of things in our society,"
371	"put the word ""design"" in, and it still works,"
373	like this quote here, you know. It kind of works, you know?
376	You can understand that. It works in truisms.
379	"""All is fair in design and war."""
381	Certainly we live in a competitive society.
383	I think this one here, there's a pop song
385	that really describes Philippe Starck for me, you know, this is like
389	you know, this is like puppy love, you know, this is cool right?
392	Toothbrush, cool.
394	It really only gets serious when you look at something like this. OK?
397	(Laughter)
399	This is one substitution that I believe
401	all of us, in design management, are guilty of.
403	And this idea that there is more to love,
407	more to design, when it gets down to your neighbor, your other,
413	it can be physical like this, and maybe in the future it will be.
416	But right now it's in dealing with our own people,
418	our own teams who are doing the creating. So, to my story.
423	The idea of people-work is what we work with here,
426	and I have to make a bond with my designers when we're creating BMWs.
430	We have to have a shared intimacy, a shared vision --
433	that means we have to work as one family;
435	we have to understand ourselves that way.
437	There's good times; there's interesting times;
440	and there's some stress times too.
442	You want to do cars, you've got to go outside.
444	You've got to do cars in the rain; you've got to do cars in the snow.
447	That's, by the way, is a presentation we made to our board of directors.
450	We haul their butts out in the snow, too. You want to know cars outside?
453	Well, you've got to stand outside to do this.
455	And because these are artists, they have very artistic temperaments.
460	All right? Now one thing about art is, art is discovery,
465	and art is discovering yourself through your art. Right?
468	And one thing about cars is we're all a little bit like Pygmalion,
472	we are completely in love with our own creations.
475	This is one of my favorite paintings, it really describes our relationship with cars.
480	This is sick beyond belief.
482	(Laughter)
484	But because of this, the intimacy with which we work together as a team
488	takes on a new dimension, a new meaning.
492	We have a shared center; we have a shared focus --
495	that car stays at the middle of all our relationships.
499	And it's my job, in the competitive process, to narrow this down.
504	I heard today about Joseph's death genes
508	that have to go in and kill cell reproduction.
511	You know, that's what I have to do sometimes.
514	We start out with 10 cars; we narrow it down to five cars,
517	down to three cars, down to two cars, down to one car,
520	and I'm in the middle of that killing, basically.
524	Someone's love, someone's baby.
526	This is very difficult, and you have to have a bond with your team
529	that permits you to do this, because their life is wrapped up in that too.
533	They've got that gene infected in them as well,
536	and they want that to live, more than anything else.
540	Well, this project, Deep Blue, put me in contact with my team
543	in a way that I never expected, and I want to pass it on to you,
546	because I want you to reflect on this, perhaps in your own relationships.
548	We wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for BMW.
553	We wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way we'd done it,
557	that I only had a phone number that connected me to them.
560	So, what we did was: instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wrist,
565	we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers
569	to find out what's the successor to the SUV phenomenon in America.
573	This is 1996 we did this project. And so we sent them off with this team name,
579	Deep Blue. Now many people know Deep Blue from IBM --
581	we actually stole it from them because we figured
583	if anybody read our faxes they'd think we're talking about computers.
586	It turned out it was quite clever because Deep Blue,
588	"in a company like BMW, has a hook -- ""Deep Blue,"" wow, cool name."
592	So people get wrapped up in it. And we took a team of designers,
595	and we sent them off to America. And we gave them a budget,
598	what we thought was a set of deliverables,
600	a timetable, and nothing else.
602	Like I said, I just had a phone number that connected me to them.
604	And a group of engineers worked in Germany,
607	and the idea was they would work separately
609	on this problem of what's the successor to the SUV.
612	They would come together, compare notes. Then they would work apart,
615	come together, and they would produce together
617	a monumental set of diverse opinions that didn't pollute each other's ideas --
621	but at the same time came together and resolved the problems.
624	Hopefully, really understand the customer at its heart,
627	where the customer is, live with them in America. So -- sent the team off,
633	and actually something different happened. They went other places.
637	(Laughter)
640	They disappeared, quite honestly, and all I got was postcards.
647	Now, I got some postcards of these guys in Las Vegas,
650	and I got some postcards of these guys in the Grand Canyon,
652	and I got these postcards of Niagara Falls,
654	and pretty soon they're in New York, and I don't know where else.
657	"And I'm telling myself, ""This is going to be a great car,"
661	"they're doing research that I've never even thought about before."""
666	Right? And they decided that instead of, like, having a studio,
673	and six or seven apartments,
676	it was cheaper to rent Elizabeth Taylor's ex-house in Malibu.
680	And -- at least they told me it was her house,
683	I guess it was at one time, she had a party there or something.
686	But anyway, this was the house, and they all lived there.
691	Now this is 24/7 living, half-a-dozen people who'd left their --
696	some had left their wives behind and families behind,
699	and they literally lived in this house
701	for the entire six months the project was in America,
704	but the first three months were the most intensive.
707	And one of the young women in the project,
709	she was a fantastic lady, she actually built her room in the bathroom.
713	The bathroom was so big, she built the bed over the bathtub --
716	it's quite fascinating.
718	On the other hand, I didn't know anything about this. OK?
722	Nothing. This is all going on, and all I'm getting is postcards
725	of these guys in Las Vegas, or whatever,
727	"saying, ""Don't worry Chris, this is really going to be good."" OK?"
730	So my concept of what a design studio was probably --
733	I wasn't up to speed on where these guys were.
736	However, the engineers back in Munich
739	had taken on this kind of Newtonian solution,
743	and they were trying to find how many cup holders
745	can dance on the head of a pin, and, you know,
747	these really serious questions that are confronting the modern consumer.
752	And one was hoping that these two teams would get together,
755	and this collusion of incredible creativity,
757	under these incredible surroundings,
759	and these incredibly stressed-out engineers,
762	would create some incredible solutions.
765	Well, what I didn't know was, and what we found out was --
768	these guys, they can't even like talk to each other under those conditions.
773	You get a divergence of Newtonian and quantum thinking at that point,
777	you have a split in your dialog that is so deep, and so far,
783	that they cannot bring this together at all.
787	And so we had our first meeting, after three months, in Tiburon,
791	which is just up the road from here -- you know Tiburon?
794	And the idea was after the first three months of this independent research
797	they would present it all to Dr. Goschel --
799	who is now my boss, and at that time he was co-mentor on the project --
802	and they would present their results.
804	We would see where we were going,
806	we would see the first indication of what could be
808	the successive phenomenon to the SUV in America.
812	And so I had these ideas in my head, that this is going to be great.
815	I mean, I'm going to see so much work, it's so intense --
817	I know probably Las Vegas meant a lot about it,
820	and I'm not really sure where the Grand Canyon came in either --
822	but somehow all this is going to come together,
825	and I'm going to see some really great product.
827	So we went to Tiburon, after three months,
829	and the team had gotten together the week before,
832	many days ahead of time.
835	The engineers flew over, and designers got together with them,
839	and they put their presentation together.
842	Well, it turns out that the engineers hadn't done anything.
848	And they hadn't done anything because --
851	kind of, like in car business, engineers are there to solve problems,
856	and we were asking them to create a problem.
859	And the engineers were waiting for the designers to say,
862	"""This is the problem that we've created, now help us solve it."""
866	And they couldn't talk about it. So what happened was,
870	the engineers showed up with nothing.
873	And the engineers told the designers,
875	"""If you go in with all your stuff, we'll walk out,"
879	"we'll walk right out of the project."""
882	So I didn't know any of this,
884	and we got a presentation that had an agenda, looked like this.
886	There was a whole lot of dialog.
889	We spent four hours being told all about vocabulary
892	that needs to be built between engineers and designers.
896	"And here I'm expecting at any moment, ""OK, they're going to turn the page,"
899	and I'm going to see the cars, I'm going to see the sketches,
901	"I'm going to see maybe some idea of where it's going."""
904	Dialog kept on going, with mental maps of words, and pretty soon
909	it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance,
912	I was seriously being baffled with bullshit.
916	And if you can imagine what this is like,
918	to have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working,
922	and they're out there spending all this money, and they're learning,
924	and they're doing all this stuff.
927	I went fucking ballistic, right? I went nuts.
933	You can probably remember Tiburon, it used to look like this.
938	After four hours of this, I stood up, and I took this team apart.
943	"I screamed at them, I yelled at them, ""What the hell are you doing?"
947	You're letting me down, you're my designers,
949	you're supposed to be the creative ones,
951	"what the hell is going on around here?"""
953	It was probably one of my better tirades, I have some good ones,
956	but this was probably one of my better ones. And I went into these people;
959	how could they take BMW's money,
961	how could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing, nothing?
967	Because of course they didn't tell us that they had three station wagons
972	full of drawings, model concepts, pictures -- everything I wanted,
979	they'd locked up in the cars, because they had shown solidarity with the engineers --
984	and they'd decided not to show me anything,
987	in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start,
990	because they hadn't realized, of course,
992	that they couldn't do problem creating.
994	So we went to lunch --
996	(Laughter)
1001	And I've got to tell you, this was one seriously quiet lunch.
1004	The engineers all sat at one end of the table,
1006	the designers and I sat at the other end of the table, really quiet.
1009	And I was just fucking furious, furious. OK?
1016	Probably because they had all the fun and I didn't, you know.
1018	That's what you get furious about right?
1020	And somebody asked me about Catherine, my wife, you know,
1022	did she fly out with me or something?
1024	"I said, ""No,"" and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife."
1028	And I recalled that when Catherine and I were married,
1032	the priest gave a very nice sermon, and he said something very important.
1037	"He said, ""Love is not selfish,"" he said,"
1040	"""Love does not mean counting how many times I say, 'I love you.'"
1044	It doesn't mean you had sex this many times this month,
1047	and it's two times less than last month,
1049	so that means you don't love me as much.
1051	"Love is not selfish."" And I thought about this, and I thought,"
1056	"""You know, I'm not showing love here. I'm seriously not showing love."
1064	I'm in the air, I'm in the air without trust.
1068	This cannot be. This cannot be that I'm expecting a certain number of sketches,
1073	and to me that's my quantification method for qualifying a team.
1078	"This cannot be."""
1080	"So I told them this story. I said, ""Guys, I'm thinking about something here,"
1083	this isn't right. I can't have a relationship with you guys
1087	based on a premise that is a quantifiable one.
1090	"Based on a dictate premise that says, 'I'm a boss, you do what I say, without trust.'"""
1098	"I said ""This can't be."""
1100	Actually, we all broke down into tears, to be quite honest about it,
1106	because they still could not tell me how much frustration they had built up
1111	inside of them, not being able to show me what I wanted,
1115	and merely having to ask me to trust them that it would come.
1120	And I think we felt much closer that day,
1123	we cut a lot of strings that didn't need to be there,
1126	and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about.
1131	We put the car back at the center of our thoughts, and we put love,
1135	I think, truly back into the center of the process.
1139	By the way, that team went on to create six different concepts
1142	for the next model of what would be the proposal
1145	for the next generation after SUVs in America.
1148	One of those was the idea of a crossover coupes --
1152	you see it downstairs, the X Coupe -- they had a lot of fun with that.
1157	It was the rendition of our motorcycle,
1160	"the GS, as Carl Magnusson says, ""brute-iful,"""
1164	as the idea of what could be a motorcycle, if you add two more wheels.
1169	And so, in conclusion, my lesson that I wanted to pass on to you,
1173	"was this one here. I'm also going to steal a little quote out of ""Little Prince."""
1177	There's a lot to be said about trust and love,
1180	if you know that those two words are synonymous for design.
1183	I had a very, very meaningful relationship with my team that day,
1187	and it's stayed that way ever since.
1189	And I hope that you too find that there's more to design,
1193	and more towards the art of the design, than doing it yourself.
1197	It's true that the trust and the love, that makes it worthwhile.
1201	Thanks so much.
1203	(Applause)
