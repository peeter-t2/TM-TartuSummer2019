12.58	I'm a neuroscientist,
13.86	and I'm the co-founder of Backyard Brains,
16.18	and our mission is to train
16.18	the next generation of neuroscientists
20.06	by taking graduate-level
20.06	neuroscience research equipment
23.1	and making it available for kids
23.1	in middle schools and high schools.
27.34	And so when we go into the classroom,
29.22	one way to get them thinking
29.22	about the brain, which is very complex,
33.14	is to ask them a very simple
33.14	question about neuroscience,
36.1	"and that is, ""What has a brain?"""
38.86	When we ask that,
40.14	students will instantly tell you
40.14	that their cat or dog has a brain,
44.22	and most will say that a mouse
44.22	or even a small insect has a brain,
48.82	but almost nobody says
48.82	that a plant or a tree
51.66	or a shrub has a brain.
53.86	And so when you push --
56.38	because this could actually
56.38	help describe a little bit
58.98	how the brain actually functions --
61.18	so you push and say,
62.42	"""Well, what is it that makes"
62.42	"living things have brains versus not?"""
65.98	And often they'll come back
65.98	with the classification
68.46	that things that move tend to have brains.
72.26	And that's absolutely correct.
73.9	Our nervous system evolved
73.9	because it is electrical.
76.38	It's fast, so we can quickly respond
76.38	to stimuli in the world
79.54	and move if we need to.
81.78	But you can go back
81.78	and push back on a student,
84.02	"and say, ""Well, you know,"
84.02	you say that plants don't have brains,
87.1	"but plants do move."""
88.58	Anyone who has grown a plant
90.46	has noticed that the plant will move
92.46	and face the sun.
94.3	But they'll say,
94.3	"""But that's a slow movement."
96.46	You know, that doesn't count.
96.46	"That could be a chemical process."""
99.5	But what about fast-moving plants?
101.9	Now, in 1760, Arthur Dobbs,
101.9	the Royal Governor of North Carolina,
107.02	made a pretty fascinating discovery.
109.58	In the swamps behind his house,
112.46	he found a plant that would spring shut
116.14	every time a bug would fall in between it.
119.54	He called this plant the flytrap,
122.5	and within a decade,
122.5	it made its way over to Europe,
125.46	where eventually the great Charles Darwin
125.46	got to study this plant,
129.02	and this plant absolutely blew him away.
131.06	He called it the most wonderful
131.06	plant in the world.
133.62	This is a plant
133.62	that was an evolutionary wonder.
135.9	This is a plant that moves quickly,
137.9	which is rare,
139.22	and it's carnivorous, which is also rare.
141.22	And this is in the same plant.
142.7	But I'm here today to tell you
144.18	that's not even the coolest thing
144.18	about this plant.
146.62	The coolest thing
146.62	is that the plant can count.
150.38	So in order to show that,
151.78	we have to get some vocabulary
151.78	out of the way.
153.98	So I'm going to do what we do
153.98	in the classroom with students.
157.26	We're going to do
157.26	an experiment on electrophysiology,
161.14	which is the recording
161.14	of the body's electrical signal,
164.3	either coming from neurons
164.3	or from muscles.
166.62	And I'm putting some electrodes
166.62	here on my wrists.
168.98	As I hook them up,
170.34	we're going to be able to see a signal
172.54	on the screen here.
174.02	And this signal may be familiar to you.
175.94	It's called the EKG,
175.94	or the electrocardiogram.
178.14	And this is coming
178.14	from neurons in my heart
180.62	that are firing
180.62	what's called action potentials,
183.18	potential meaning voltage and action
183.18	meaning it moves quickly up and down,
187.06	which causes my heart to fire,
188.54	which then causes
188.54	the signal that you see here.
191.38	And so I want you to remember the shape
191.38	of what we'll be looking at right here,
195.14	because this is going to be important.
197.02	This is a way that the brain
197.02	encodes information
199.46	in the form of an action potential.
201.18	So now let's turn to some plants.
204.74	So I'm going to first
204.74	introduce you to the mimosa,
208.3	not the drink, but the Mimosa pudica,
211.54	and this is a plant that's found
211.54	in Central America and South America,
214.9	and it has behaviors.
216.9	And the first behavior
216.9	I'm going to show you
219.02	is if I touch the leaves here,
221.14	you get to see that the leaves
221.14	tend to curl up.
225.1	And then the second behavior is,
227.38	if I tap the leaf,
229.58	the entire branch seems to fall down.
231.42	So why does it do that?
232.98	It's not really known to science.
234.62	One of the reasons why
234.62	could be that it scares away insects
237.86	or it looks less appealing to herbivores.
240.06	But how does it do that?
240.06	Now, that's interesting.
242.58	We can do an experiment to find out.
244.74	So what we're going to do now,
246.22	just like I recorded
246.22	the electrical potential from my body,
249.66	we're going to record the electrical
249.66	potential from this plant, this mimosa.
253.5	And so what we're going to do
253.5	is I've got a wire wrapped around the stem,
259.02	and I've got the ground electrode where?
262.18	In the ground. It's an electrical
262.18	engineering joke. Alright.
265.14	(Laughter)
266.5	Alright. So I'm going to go ahead
266.5	and tap the leaf here,
269.26	and I want you to look
269.26	at the electrical recording
271.659	that we're going to see inside the plant.
274.34	Whoa. It is so big,
274.34	I've got to scale it down.
277.26	Alright. So what is that?
278.7	That is an action potential
278.7	that is happening inside the plant.
281.7	Why was it happening?
282.98	Because it wanted to move. Right?
284.62	And so when I hit the touch receptors,
287.66	it sent a voltage all the way down
287.66	to the end of the stem,
290.86	which caused it to move.
292.14	And now, in our arms,
292.14	we would move our muscles,
294.42	but the plant doesn't have muscles.
296.14	What it has is water inside the cells
298.42	and when the voltage hits it,
298.42	it opens up, releases the water,
301.38	changes the shape of the cells,
301.38	and the leaf falls.
304.3	OK. So here we see an action potential
304.3	encoding information to move. Alright?
309.26	But can it do more?
310.78	So let's go to find out.
312.06	We're going to go to our good friend,
312.06	the Venus flytrap here,
315.14	and we're going to take a look
315.14	at what happens inside the leaf
319.58	when a fly lands on here.
321.54	So I'm going to pretend
321.54	to be a fly right now.
324.26	And now here's my Venus flytrap,
325.94	and inside the leaf,
325.94	you're going to notice
327.98	that there are three little hairs here,
327.98	and those are trigger hairs.
331.22	And so when a fly lands --
332.62	I'm going to touch
332.62	one of the hairs right now.
335.14	Ready? One, two, three.
338.82	What do we get? We get
338.82	a beautiful action potential.
341.3	However, the flytrap doesn't close.
344.46	And to understand why that is,
345.94	we need to know a little bit more
345.94	about the behavior of the flytrap.
349.18	Number one is that it takes
349.18	a long time to open the traps back up --
352.5	you know, about 24 to 48 hours
352.5	if there's no fly inside of it.
356.7	And so it takes a lot of energy.
358.42	And two, it doesn't need to eat
358.42	that many flies throughout the year.
361.66	Only a handful. It gets
361.66	most of its energy from the sun.
364.34	It's just trying to replace
364.34	some nutrients in the ground with flies.
367.58	And the third thing is,
368.86	it only opens then closes the traps
368.86	a handful of times
371.86	until that trap dies.
373.94	So therefore, it wants
373.94	to make really darn sure
376.66	that there's a meal inside of it
376.66	before the flytrap snaps shut.
381.1	So how does it do that?
383.1	It counts the number of seconds
385.74	between successive
385.74	touching of those hairs.
388.98	And so the idea is
388.98	that there's a high probability,
391.42	if there's a fly inside of there,
391.42	that it's going to be clicked together,
394.9	and so when it gets the first
394.9	action potential,
397.14	it starts counting, one, two,
398.58	and if it gets to 20
398.58	and it doesn't fire again,
400.82	then it's not going to close,
402.26	but if it does it within there,
402.26	then the flytrap will close.
405.14	So we're going to go back now.
406.62	I'm going to touch
406.62	the Venus flytrap again.
408.66	I've been talking
408.66	for more than 20 seconds.
410.7	So we can see what happens
410.7	when I touch the hair a second time.
415.54	So what do we get?
415.54	We get a second action potential,
418.02	but again, the leaf doesn't close.
419.94	So now if I go back in there
421.9	and if I'm a fly moving around,
423.82	I'm going to be touching
423.82	the leaf a few times.
426.02	I'm going to go and brush it a few times.
428.46	And immediately,
429.9	the flytrap closes.
431.66	So here we are seeing the flytrap
431.66	actually doing a computation.
435.82	It's determining
435.82	if there's a fly inside the trap,
438.34	and then it closes.
439.86	So let's go back to our original question.
443.34	Do plants have brains?
445.66	Well, the answer is no.
447.26	There's no brains in here.
448.66	There's no axons, no neurons.
452.26	It doesn't get depressed.
453.66	It doesn't want to know
453.66	what the Tigers' score is.
456.06	It doesn't have
456.06	self-actualization problems.
458.18	But what it does have
458.18	is something that's very similar to us,
461.62	which is the ability
461.62	to communicate using electricity.
464.7	It just uses slightly
464.7	different ions than we do,
466.98	but it's actually doing the same thing.
469.02	So just to show you
471.22	the ubiquitous nature
471.22	of these action potentials,
474.54	we saw it in the Venus flytrap,
476.78	we've seen an action
476.78	potential in the mimosa.
478.94	We've even seen
478.94	an action potential in a human.
481.34	Now, this is the euro of the brain.
484.58	It's the way that all
484.58	information is passed.
486.74	And so what we can do
486.74	is we can use those action potentials
489.58	to pass information
491.1	between species of plants.
492.86	And so this is our interspecies
492.86	plant-to-plant communicator,
497.3	and what we've done
497.3	is we've created a brand new experiment
500.5	where we're going to record
500.5	the action potential from a Venus flytrap,
504.06	and we're going to send it
504.06	into the sensitive mimosa.
506.86	So I want you to recall what happens
508.62	when we touch the leaves of the mimosa.
510.58	It has touch receptors
510.58	that are sending that information
513.26	back down in the form
513.26	of an action potential.
515.38	And so what would happen
516.74	if we took the action potential
516.74	from the Venus flytrap
520.38	and sent it into
520.38	all the stems of the mimosa?
524.26	We should be able to create
524.26	the behavior of the mimosas
527.3	without actually touching it ourselves.
529.22	And so if you'll allow me,
531.26	I'm going to go ahead
531.26	and trigger this mimosa right now
534.739	by touching on the hairs
534.739	of the Venus flytrap.
538.58	So we're going to send information
538.58	about touch from one plant to another.
546.46	So there you see it.
548.18	So --
549.42	(Applause)
555.46	So I hope you learned a little bit,
555.46	something about plants today,
558.54	and not only that.
559.78	You learned that plants could be used
559.78	to help teach neuroscience
562.82	and bring along the neurorevolution.
564.58	Thank you.
565.82	(Applause)
