13.46	Chris Anderson: This is such
13.46	a strange thing.
15.659	Your software, Linux,
15.659	is in millions of computers,
18.841	it probably powers much of the Internet.
22.412	And I think that there are, like,
24.199	a billion and a half active
24.199	Android devices out there.
27.568	Your software is in every
27.568	single one of them.
30.808	It's kind of amazing.
31.982	You must have some amazing
31.982	software headquarters driving all this.
37.041	That's what I thought -- and I was shocked
37.041	when I saw a picture of it.
40.371	I mean, this is --
41.595	this is the Linux world headquarters.
43.869	(Laughter)
45.883	(Applause)
49.913	Linus Torvalds: It really
49.913	doesn't look like much.
52.223	And I have to say,
53.923	the most interesting part in this picture,
57.767	that people mostly react to,
59.494	is the walking desk.
60.961	It is the most interesting
60.961	part in my office
63.684	and I'm not actually using it anymore.
65.668	And I think the two things are related.
69.206	The way I work is ...
73.245	I want to not have external stimulation.
78.17	You can kind of see,
78.17	on the walls are this light green.
83.461	I'm told that at mental institutions
83.461	they use that on the walls.
87.949	(Laughter)
89.02	It's like a calming color,
90.829	it's not something
90.829	that really stimulates you.
95.064	What you can't see is the computer here,
95.064	you only see the screen,
99.513	but the main thing I worry
99.513	about in my computer is --
102.918	it doesn't have to be big
102.918	and powerful, although I like that --
106.277	it really has to be completely silent.
109.975	I know people who work for Google
112.01	and they have their own
112.01	small data center at home,
115.241	and I don't do that.
116.417	My office is the most
116.417	boring office you'll ever see.
120.146	And I sit there alone in the quiet.
124.136	If the cat comes up,
126.197	it sits in my lap.
128.058	And I want to hear the cat purring,
130.272	not the sound of the fans in the computer.
133.47	CA: So this is astonishing,
134.803	because working this way,
137.505	you're able to run this vast
137.505	technology empire --
140.517	it is an empire --
141.762	so that's an amazing testament
141.762	to the power of open source.
145.486	Tell us how you got
145.486	to understand open source
149.686	and how it lead
149.686	to the development of Linux.
153.546	LT: I mean, I still work alone.
155.075	Really -- I work alone in my house,
158.666	often in my bathrobe.
160.08	When a photographer shows up, I dress up,
162.665	so I have clothes on.
163.975	(Laughter)
165.236	And that's how I've always worked.
167.332	I mean, this was how I started Linux, too.
169.364	I did not start Linux
169.364	as a collaborative project.
173.037	I started it as one
173.037	in a series of many projects
177.939	I had done at the time for myself,
181.92	partly because I needed the end result,
183.846	but even more because I just
183.846	enjoyed programming.
186.172	So it was about the end of the journey,
190.57	which, 25 years later,
190.57	we still have not reached.
193.94	But it was really about the fact
193.94	that I was looking for a project on my own
197.681	and there was no open source,
197.681	really, on my radar at all.
201.988	And what happened is ...
204.668	the project grows and becomes something
204.668	you want to show off to people.
210.552	"Really, this is more of a, ""Wow,"
210.552	"look at what I did!"""
214.693	And trust me -- it was not
214.693	that great back then.
218.128	I made it publicly available,
220.026	and it wasn't even
220.026	open source at that point.
222.156	At that point it was source that was open,
222.156	but there was no intention
227.349	behind using the kind of open-source
227.349	methodology that we think of today
232.487	to improve it.
233.662	It was more like,
234.837	"""Look, I've been working"
234.837	on this for half a year,
238.459	"I'd love to have comments."""
240.717	And other people approached me.
243.217	At the University of Helsinki,
244.893	I had a friend who was one
244.893	of the open source --
248.632	it was called mainly
248.632	"""free software"" back then --"
252.312	and he actually introduced me
252.312	to the notion that, hey,
256.61	you can use these open-source
256.61	licenses that had been around.
264.114	And I thought about it for a while.
266.179	I was actually worried about the whole
266.179	commercial interests coming in.
269.694	I mean, that's one of the worries
269.694	I think most people who start out have,
274.192	is that they worry about somebody
274.192	taking advantage of their work, right?
279.603	"And I decided, ""What the hell?"""
283.74	And --
284.914	CA: And then at some point,
286.233	someone contributed
286.233	some code that you thought,
288.717	"""Wow, that really is interesting,"
288.717	I would not have thought of that.
291.912	"This could actually improve this."""
293.587	LT: It didn't even start
293.587	by people contributing code,
296.136	it was more that people
296.136	started contributing ideas.
299.748	And just the fact that somebody else
299.748	takes a look at your project --
303.018	and I'm sure it's true
303.018	of other things, too,
305.59	but it's definitely true in code --
307.451	is that somebody else
307.451	takes an interest in your code,
310.974	looks at it enough to actually
310.974	give you feedback
313.52	and give you ideas.
315.433	That was a huge thing for me.
317.158	I was 21 at the time, so I was young,
320.374	but I had already programmed
320.374	for half my life, basically.
324.372	And every project before that
324.372	had been completely personal
328.368	and it was a revelation when people
328.368	just started commenting,
331.499	started giving feedback on your code.
334.824	And even before they started
334.824	giving code back,
338.62	that was, I think, one of the big
338.62	moments where I said,
341.385	"""I love other people!"""
343.282	Don't get me wrong --
344.463	I'm actually not a people person.
346.111	(Laughter)
349.5	I don't really love other people --
352.076	(Laughter)
353.12	But I love computers,
354.77	I love interacting with other
354.77	people on email,
357.009	because it kind of gives you that buffer.
360.365	But I do love other people who comment
360.365	and get involved in my project.
366.89	And it made it so much more.
369.273	CA: So was there a moment
369.273	when you saw what was being built
372.131	and it suddenly started taking off,
374.362	"and you thought, ""Wait a sec,"
374.362	this actually could be something huge,
377.676	not just a personal project
377.676	that I'm getting nice feedback on,
380.612	but a kind of explosive development
380.612	"in the whole technology world""?"
385.821	LT: Not really.
387.004	I mean, the big point for me, really,
387.004	was not when it was becoming huge,
390.6	it was when it was becoming little.
393.709	The big point for me was not being alone
397.25	and having 10, maybe 100
397.25	people being involved --
400.991	that was a big point.
402.494	Then everything else was very gradual.
405.557	Going from 100 people to a million people
405.557	is not a big deal -- to me.
409.84	Well, I mean, maybe it is if you're --
411.697	(Laughter)
412.722	If you want to sell your result
412.722	then it's a huge deal --
415.464	don't get me wrong.
416.639	But if you're interested in the technology
418.79	and you're interested in the project,
420.669	the big part was getting the community.
422.574	Then the community grew gradually.
424.222	And there's actually not
424.222	a single point where I went like,
428.166	"""Wow, that just took off!"" because it --"
430.366	I mean -- it took a long time, relatively.
433.714	CA: So all the technologists
433.714	that I talk to really credit you
436.714	with massively changing their work.
439.612	And it's not just Linux,
441.259	it's this thing called Git,
442.729	which is this management system
442.729	for software development.
446.765	Tell us briefly about that
446.765	and your role in that.
450.481	LT: So one of the issues we had,
452.294	and this took a while to start to appear,
455.37	is when you ...
457.708	When you grow from having 10 people
457.708	or 100 people working on a project
463.064	to having 10,000 people, which --
465.476	I mean, right now we're in the situation
465.476	where just on the kernel,
468.966	we have 1,000 people involved
468.966	in every single release
472.164	and that's every two months,
472.164	roughly two or three months.
476.336	Some of those people don't do a lot.
478.781	There's a lot of people
478.781	who make small, small changes.
481.388	But to maintain this,
483.658	the scale changes how
483.658	you have to maintain it.
486.571	And we went through a lot of pain.
490.713	And there are whole projects
490.713	that do only source-code maintenance.
497.266	CVS is the one that used to be
497.266	the most commonly used,
500.582	and I hated CVS with a passion
500.582	and refused to touch it
504.503	and tried something else
504.503	that was radical and interesting
507.59	and everybody else hated.
511.004	CA: (Laughs)
512.402	LT: And we were in this bad spot,
514.514	where we had thousands of people
514.514	who wanted to participate,
517.355	but in many ways,
517.355	I was the kind of break point,
522.42	where I could not scale to the point
524.968	where I could work
524.968	with thousands of people.
527.792	So Git is my second big project,
530.268	which was only created for me
530.268	to maintain my first big project.
535.433	And this is literally how I work.
537.704	I don't code for --
540.233	well, I do code for fun --
541.979	but I want to code
541.979	for something meaningful
544.384	so every single project I've ever done
544.384	has been something I needed
548.455	and --
549.855	CA: So really, both Linux
549.855	and Git kind of arose
553.312	almost as an unintended consequence
555.672	of your desire not to have
555.672	to work with too many people.
558.367	LT: Absolutely. Yes.
559.542	(Laughter)
560.646	CA: That's amazing.
560.646	LT: Yeah.
562.32	(Applause)
563.836	And yet, you're the man
563.836	who's transformed technology
567.251	not just once but twice,
568.592	and we have to try
568.592	and understand why it is.
571.199	You've given us some clues, but ...
572.907	Here's a picture of you as a kid,
572.907	with a Rubik's Cube.
577.572	You mentioned that you've been
577.572	programming since you were like 10 or 11,
581.716	half your life.
583.105	Were you this sort of computer
583.105	genius, you know, übernerd,
586.945	were you the star at school
586.945	who could do everything?
589.454	What were you like as a kid?
592.13	LT: Yeah, I think I was
592.13	the prototypical nerd.
594.647	I mean, I was ...
597.13	I was not a people person back then.
599.116	That's my younger brother.
601.72	I was clearly more interested
601.72	in the Rubik's Cube
604.531	than my younger brother.
606.08	(Laughter)
607.191	My younger sister,
607.191	who's not in the picture,
610.335	when we had family meetings --
612.773	and it's not a huge family, but I have,
612.773	like, a couple of cousins --
616.589	she would prep me beforehand.
619.477	Like, before I stepped
619.477	into the room she would say,
622.067	"""OK. That's so-and-so ..."""
625.925	Because I was not --
628.278	I was a geek.
629.517	I was into computers,
630.707	I was into math,
631.89	I was into physics.
633.065	I was good at that.
634.24	I don't think I was
634.24	particularly exceptional.
637.554	Apparently, my sister said
639.969	that my biggest exceptional quality
639.969	was that I would not let go.
647.618	CA: OK, so let's go there,
647.618	because that's interesting.
650.199	You would not let go.
651.397	So that's not about being
651.397	a geek and being smart,
654.286	that's about being ... stubborn?
657.415	LT: That's about being stubborn.
658.966	That's about, like,
661.093	just starting something
663.317	"and not saying, ""OK, I'm done,"
663.317	let's do something else --
668.791	"Look: shiny!"""
670.954	And I notice that in many
670.954	other parts in my life, too.
675.47	I lived in Silicon Valley for seven years.
678.744	And I worked for the same
678.744	company, in Silicon Valley,
682.88	for the whole time.
684.618	That is unheard of.
687.204	That's not how Silicon Valley works.
688.995	The whole point of Silicon Valley
688.995	is that people jump between jobs
692.598	to kind of mix up the pot.
695.249	And that's not the kind of person I am.
697.153	CA: But during the actual
697.153	development of Linux itself,
699.748	that stubbornness sometimes brought
699.748	you in conflict with other people.
704.445	Talk about that a bit.
706.123	Was that essential to sort of maintain
706.123	the quality of what was being built?
711.691	How would you describe what happened?
714.392	LT: I don't know if it's essential.
717.239	"Going back to the ""I'm not"
717.239	"a people person,"" --"
720.408	sometimes I'm also ...
724.1	shall we say,
725.657	"""myopic"" when it comes"
725.657	to other people's feelings,
729.667	and that sometimes makes you
729.667	say things that hurt other people.
734.969	And I'm not proud of that.
738.761	(Applause)
739.899	But, at the same time, it's --
742.978	I get people who tell me
742.978	that I should be nice.
746.796	And then when I try to explain to them
746.796	that maybe you're nice,
752.488	maybe you should be more aggressive,
754.766	they see that as me being not nice.
758.332	(Laughter)
760.466	What I'm trying to say
760.466	is we are different.
762.658	I'm not a people person;
764.492	it's not something
764.492	I'm particularly proud of,
766.622	but it's part of me.
768.186	And one of the things
768.186	I really like about open source
770.915	is it really allows different
770.915	people to work together.
776.731	We don't have to like each other --
778.479	and sometimes we really
778.479	don't like each other.
780.706	Really -- I mean, there are very,
780.706	very heated arguments.
784.217	But you can, actually,
784.217	you can find things that --
788.327	you don't even agree to disagree,
790.578	it's just that you're interested
790.578	in really different things.
793.648	And coming back to the point
793.648	where I said earlier
796.575	that I was afraid of commercial people
796.575	taking advantage of your work,
800.892	it turned out, and very
800.892	quickly turned out,
803.515	that those commercial people
803.515	were lovely, lovely people.
806.505	And they did all the things that I was not
806.505	at all interested in doing,
810.235	and they had completely different goals.
812.316	And they used open source in ways
812.316	that I just did not want to go.
817.663	But because it was open
817.663	source they could do it,
819.949	and it actually works
819.949	really beautifully together.
822.325	And I actually think
822.325	it works the same way.
824.373	You need to have the people-people,
824.373	the communicators,
827.602	the warm and friendly people
829.053	who like --
830.799	(Laughter)
832.265	really want to hug you
832.265	and get you into the community.
835.339	But that's not everybody.
836.934	And that's not me.
838.39	I care about the technology.
839.871	There are people who care about the UI.
841.776	I can't do UI to save my life.
844.87	I mean, if I was stranded on an island
847.915	and the only way to get off that island
847.915	was the make a pretty UI,
851.339	I'd die there.
852.526	(Laughter)
853.701	So there's different kinds of people,
855.864	and I'm not making excuses,
855.864	I'm trying to explain.
858.753	CA: Now, when we talked last week,
860.443	you talked about some
860.443	other trait that you have,
862.952	which I found really interesting.
864.567	It's this idea called taste.
865.974	And I've just got a couple of images here.
868.354	I think this is an example of not
868.354	particularly good taste in code,
872.381	and this one is better taste,
875.396	which one can immediately see.
877.483	What is the difference between these two?
880.639	LT: So this is --
881.845	How many people here actually have coded?
885.671	CA: Oh my goodness.
887.215	LT: So I guarantee you,
888.394	everybody who raised their hand,
889.963	they have done what's called
889.963	a singly-linked list.
892.608	And it's taught --
895.115	This, the first not very
895.115	good taste approach,
898.73	is basically how it's taught to be done
898.73	when you start out coding.
902.821	And you don't have to understand the code.
904.889	The most interesting part to me
906.969	is the last if statement.
910.933	Because what happens
910.933	in a singly-linked list --
913.217	this is trying to remove
913.217	an existing entry from a list --
916.891	and there's a difference
916.891	between if it's the first entry
920.757	or whether it's an entry in the middle.
922.78	Because if it's the first entry,
924.409	you have to change
924.409	the pointer to the first entry.
927.449	If it's in the middle,
928.671	you have to change the pointer
928.671	of a previous entry.
931.116	So they're two completely different cases.
933.164	CA: And that's better.
934.34	LT: And this is better.
935.94	It does not have the if statement.
938.637	And it doesn't really matter --
940.874	I don't want you understand
940.874	why it doesn't have the if statement,
944.099	but I want you to understand
945.465	that sometimes you can see
945.465	a problem in a different way
948.114	and rewrite it so that
948.114	a special case goes away
951.492	and becomes the normal case.
953.393	And that's good code.
955.328	But this is simple code.
956.902	This is CS 101.
958.275	This is not important --
958.275	although, details are important.
961.798	To me, the sign of people
961.798	I really want to work with
965.9	is that they have good taste,
965.9	which is how ...
969.295	I sent you this stupid example
970.916	that is not relevant
970.916	because it's too small.
973.743	Good taste is much bigger than this.
975.909	Good taste is about really
975.909	seeing the big patterns
979.954	and kind of instinctively knowing
979.954	what's the right way to do things.
984.436	CA: OK, so we're putting
984.436	the pieces together here now.
987.736	You have taste,
990.057	in a way that's meaningful
990.057	to software people.
992.418	You're --
993.593	(Laughter)
995.433	LT: I think it was meaningful
995.433	to some people here.
999.967	CA: You're a very smart computer coder,
1002.908	and you're hellish stubborn.
1005.622	But there must be something else.
1007.232	I mean, you've changed the future.
1008.879	You must have the ability
1008.879	of these grand visions of the future.
1011.866	You're a visionary, right?
1013.151	LT: I've actually felt slightly
1013.151	uncomfortable at TED
1015.766	for the last two days,
1017.95	because there's a lot
1017.95	of vision going on, right?
1020.569	And I am not a visionary.
1022.29	I do not have a five-year plan.
1024.543	I'm an engineer.
1025.925	And I think it's really --
1027.209	I mean -- I'm perfectly
1027.209	happy with all the people
1029.552	who are walking around
1029.552	and just staring at the clouds
1032.327	and looking at the stars
1032.327	"and saying, ""I want to go there."""
1035.202	But I'm looking at the ground,
1036.678	and I want to fix the pothole
1036.678	that's right in front of me
1039.557	before I fall in.
1040.941	This is the kind of person I am.
1042.584	(Cheers)
1043.719	(Applause)
1045.055	CA: So you spoke to me last week
1045.055	about these two guys.
1049.358	Who are they and how
1049.358	do you relate to them?
1052.239	LT: Well, so this is kind
1052.239	of cliché in technology,
1055.865	the whole Tesla versus Edison,
1057.896	where Tesla is seen as the visionary
1057.896	scientist and crazy idea man.
1062.861	And people love Tesla.
1065.667	I mean, there are people who name
1065.667	their companies after him.
1068.678	(Laughter)
1071.365	The other person there is Edison,
1074.001	who is actually often vilified
1074.001	for being kind of pedestrian
1077.532	and is --
1079.477	I mean, his most famous quote is,
1082.223	"""Genius is one percent inspiration"
1082.223	"and 99 percent perspiration."""
1087.394	And I'm in the Edison camp,
1088.871	even if people don't always like him.
1091.079	Because if you actually compare the two,
1094.122	Tesla has kind of this mind
1094.122	grab these days,
1098.679	but who actually changed the world?
1101.853	Edison may not have been a nice person,
1105.259	he did a lot of things --
1108.415	he was maybe not so intellectual,
1110.868	not so visionary.
1113.119	But I think I'm more
1113.119	of an Edison than a Tesla.
1117.669	CA: So our theme at TED
1117.669	this week is dreams --
1120.131	big, bold, audacious dreams.
1121.502	You're really the antidote to that.
1123.328	LT: I'm trying to dial it down a bit, yes.
1125.461	CA: That's good.
1126.636	(Laughter)
1127.74	We embrace you, we embrace you.
1131.046	Companies like Google and many
1131.046	others have made, arguably,
1133.819	like, billions of dollars
1133.819	out of your software.
1136.049	Does that piss you off?
1137.224	LT: No.
1138.399	No, it doesn't piss me off
1138.399	for several reasons.
1141.057	And one of them is, I'm doing fine.
1143.091	I'm really doing fine.
1144.942	But the other reason is --
1146.55	I mean, without doing the whole
1146.55	open source and really letting go thing,
1151.901	Linux would never have been what it is.
1154.151	And it's brought experiences
1154.151	I don't really enjoy, public talking,
1159.271	but at the same time,
1159.271	this is an experience.
1161.446	Trust me.
1163.238	So there's a lot of things going on
1163.238	that make me a very happy man
1168.405	and thinking I did the right choices.
1170.958	CA: Is the open source idea --
1172.894	this is, I think we'll end here --
1174.554	is the open source idea
1174.554	fully realized now in the world,
1178.632	or is there more that it could go,
1181.674	are there more things that it could do?
1184.738	LT: So, I'm of two minds there.
1186.996	I think one reason open source
1186.996	works so well in code
1191.506	is that at the end of the day,
1193.939	code tends to be somewhat black and white.
1197.209	There's often a fairly good way to decide,
1201.39	this is done correctly
1201.39	and this is not done well.
1205.36	Code either works or it doesn't,
1207.762	which means that there's less
1207.762	room for arguments.
1212.394	And we have arguments despite this, right?
1216.049	In many other areas --
1217.988	I mean, people have talked about
1217.988	open politics and things like that --
1221.753	and it's really hard sometimes to say
1224.726	that, yes, you can apply the same
1224.726	principles in some other areas
1228.507	just because the black and white
1228.507	turns into not just gray,
1233.97	but different colors.
1236.339	So, obviously open source in science
1236.339	is making a comeback.
1240.729	Science was there first.
1242.387	But then science ended up
1242.387	being pretty closed,
1245.078	with very expensive journals
1245.078	and some of that going on.
1248.726	And open source is making
1248.726	a comeback in science,
1252.586	with things like arXiv and open journals.
1259.262	Wikipedia changed the world, too.
1261.239	So there are other examples,
1262.717	I'm sure there are more to come.
1265.66	CA: But you're not a visionary,
1267.251	and so it's not up to you to name them.
1269.228	LT: No.
1270.411	(Laughter)
1271.483	It's up to you guys to make them, right?
1273.471	CA: Exactly.
1274.758	Linus Torvalds,
1275.94	thank you for Linux,
1275.94	thank you for the Internet,
1278.209	thank you for all those Android phones.
1280.098	Thank you for coming here to TED
1280.098	and revealing so much of yourself.
1283.319	LT: Thank you.
1284.495	(Applause)
