16.74	I thought I would start
16.74	with a very brief history of cities.
21.3	Settlements typically began
21.3	with people clustered around a well,
25.9	and the size of that settlement
25.9	was roughly the distance you could walk
29.258	with a pot of water on your head.
31.22	In fact, if you fly
31.22	over Germany, for example,
34.74	and you look down and you see
34.74	these hundreds of little villages,
37.764	they're all about a mile apart.
39.524	You needed easy access to the fields.
42.34	And for hundreds, even thousands of years,
45.74	the home was really the center of life.
48.34	Life was very small for most people.
50.94	It was a center of entertainment,
50.94	of energy production, of work,
57.06	a center of health care.
58.3	That's where babies were born
58.3	and people died.
61.62	Then, with industrialization,
61.62	everything started to become centralized.
66.5	You had dirty factories that were moved
66.5	to the outskirts of cities.
70.54	Production was centralized
70.54	in assembly plants.
74.9	You had centralized energy production.
78.5	Learning took place in schools.
80.219	Health care took place in hospitals.
84.26	And then you had networks that developed.
86.3	You had water, sewer networks
88.94	that allowed for this
88.94	kind of unchecked expansion.
92.82	You had separated functions, increasingly.
96.46	You had rail networks
98.22	that connected residential,
98.22	industrial, commercial areas.
101.06	You had auto networks.
102.7	In fact, the model was really,
102.7	give everybody a car,
105.98	build roads to everything,
107.34	and give people a place to park
107.34	when they get there.
109.82	It was not a very functional model.
111.54	And we still live in that world,
113.94	and this is what we end up with.
116.1	So you have the sprawl of LA,
118.18	the sprawl of Mexico City.
120.38	You have these unbelievable
120.38	new cities in China,
123.5	which you might call tower sprawl.
125.86	They're all building cities
127.22	on the model that we invented
127.22	in the '50s and '60s,
130.18	which is really obsolete, I would argue,
132.22	and there are hundreds
132.22	and hundreds of new cities
134.53	that are being planned all over the world.
136.61	In China alone, 300 million people,
136.61	some say 400 million people,
140.66	will move to the city
140.66	over the next 15 years.
143.02	That means building the equivalent
145.54	of the entire built infrastructure
145.54	of the US in 15 years.
148.38	Imagine that.
149.62	And we should all care about this
149.62	whether you live in cities or not.
154.3	Cities will account for 90 percent
154.3	of the population growth,
162.7	but at the same time
162.7	it's where people want to be,
165.22	increasingly.
166.82	More than half the people
166.82	now in the world live in cities,
169.66	and that will just continue to escalate.
172.38	Cities are places of celebration,
172.38	personal expression.
176.02	You have the flash mobs
176.02	of pillow fights that --
179.34	I've been to a couple. They're quite fun.
181.46	You have --
182.7	(Laughter)
183.98	Cities are where most
183.98	of the wealth is created,
186.82	and particularly in the developing world,
186.82	it's where women find opportunities.
190.54	That's a lot of the reason
190.54	why cities are growing very quickly.
193.98	Now there's some trends
193.98	that will impact cities.
196.62	First of all, work is becoming
196.62	distributed and mobile.
199.54	The office building is basically obsolete
199.54	for doing private work.
203.18	The home, once again,
203.18	because of distributed computation --
207.58	Communication is becoming
207.58	a center of life,
209.62	so it's a center of production
209.62	and learning and shopping and health care
213.82	and all of these things
213.82	that we used to think of
216.62	as taking place outside of the home.
219.46	And increasingly,
219.46	everything that people buy,
222.46	every consumer product,
223.82	in one way or another,
223.82	can be personalized.
226.78	And that's a very important
226.78	trend to think about.
229.22	So this is my image
229.22	of the city of the future.
232.319	(Laughter)
234.7	In that it's a place for people, you know.
236.98	Maybe not the way people dress, but --
239.7	You know, the question now is,
241.153	how can we have all the good things
241.153	that we identify with cities
244.62	without all the bad things?
246.46	This is Bangalore.
247.7	It took me a couple of hours
247.7	to get a few miles in Bangalore last year.
251.78	So with cities, you also have
251.78	congestion and pollution
254.34	and disease and all these negative things.
257.02	How can we have the good stuff
257.02	without the bad?
259.26	So we went back and started looking
259.26	at the great cities
261.856	that evolved before the cars.
263.98	Paris was a series of these
263.98	little villages that came together,
268.34	and you still see that structure today.
270.26	The 20 arrondissements of Paris
270.26	are these little neighborhoods.
273.237	Most of what people need in life
273.237	can be within a five- or 10-minute walk.
277.98	And if you look at the data,
277.98	when you have that kind of a structure,
281.22	you get a very even distribution
282.94	of the shops and the physicians
282.94	and the pharmacies
286.34	and the cafes in Paris.
288.26	And then you look at cities
288.26	that evolved after the automobile,
291.22	and it's not that kind of a pattern.
292.98	There's very little
292.98	that's within a five-minute walk
296.02	of most areas of places like Pittsburgh.
298.34	Not to pick on Pittsburgh,
299.62	but most American cities
299.62	really have evolved this way.
304.18	So we said, well,
304.18	let's look at new cities,
306.38	and we're involved in a couple
306.38	of new city projects in China.
310.62	So we said, let's start
310.62	with that neighborhood cell.
313.1	We think of it as a compact urban cell.
315.02	So provide most of what most people want
315.02	within that 20-minute walk.
318.62	This can also be
318.62	a resilient electrical microgrid,
322.18	community heating, power,
322.18	communication networks, etc.
325.78	can be concentrated there.
327.58	Stewart Brand would put
327.58	a micronuclear reactor
330.46	right in the center, probably.
332.46	And he might be right.
333.94	And then we can form,
333.94	in effect, a mesh network.
337.5	It's something of an Internet
337.5	typology pattern,
341.14	so you can have a series
341.14	of these neighborhoods.
343.66	You can dial up the density --
345.14	about 20,000 people per cell,
345.14	if it's Cambridge.
347.66	Go up to 50,000 if it's Manhattan density.
350.22	You connect everything with mass transit
352.34	and you provide most of what most people
352.34	need within that neighborhood.
356.62	You can begin to develop
356.62	a whole typology of streetscapes
359.86	and the vehicles that can go on them.
362.94	I won't go through all of them.
362.94	I'll just show one.
365.38	This is Boulder. It's a great example
365.38	of kind of a mobility parkway,
369.3	a superhighway for joggers and bicyclists,
372.06	where you can go from one end
372.06	of the city to the other
374.608	without crossing the street,
376.38	and they also have bike-sharing,
376.38	which I'll get into in a minute.
380.18	This is even a more interesting solution
382.38	in Seoul, Korea.
383.62	They took the elevated highway,
383.62	they got rid of it,
386.06	they reclaimed the street,
386.06	the river down below,
389.7	below the street,
391.1	and you can go from one end
391.1	of Seoul to the other
393.46	without crossing a pathway for cars.
397.14	The High Line in Manhattan
397.14	is very similar.
401.62	You have these rapidly emerging
401.62	bike lanes all over the world.
405.82	I lived in Manhattan for 15 years.
407.5	I went back a couple of weekends ago,
409.78	took this photograph of these fabulous
409.78	new bike lanes that they have installed.
415.38	They're still not to where Copenhagen is,
418.22	where something like 42 percent
418.22	of the trips within the city
421.66	are by bicycle.
422.9	It's mostly just because they have
422.9	fantastic infrastructure there.
426.7	We actually did exactly
426.7	the wrong thing in Boston.
429.42	The Big Dig --
431.5	(Laughter)
434.02	So we got rid of the highway
434.02	but we created a traffic island,
438.06	and it's certainly not a mobility pathway
438.06	for anything other than cars.
442.78	Mobility on demand is something
442.78	we've been thinking about,
445.54	so we think we need an ecosystem
445.54	of these shared-use vehicles
448.86	connected to mass transit.
450.98	These are some of the vehicles
450.98	that we've been working on.
454.06	But shared use is really key.
455.74	If you share a vehicle, you can have
455.74	at least four people use one vehicle,
459.66	as opposed to one.
461.54	We have Hubway here in Boston,
461.54	the VÃ©lib' system in Paris.
468.02	We've been developing,
468.02	at the Media Lab, this little city car
472.3	that is optimized
472.3	for shared use in cities.
475.5	We got rid of all the useless things
475.5	like engines and transmissions.
478.9	We moved everything to the wheels,
480.9	so you have the drive motor,
482.3	the steering motor, the breaking --
482.3	all in the wheel.
484.82	That left the chassis unencumbered,
484.82	so you can do things like fold,
488.02	so you can fold this little vehicle up
488.02	to occupy a tiny little footprint.
493.7	This was a video that was
493.7	on European television last week
497.18	showing the Spanish Minister of Industry
497.18	driving this little vehicle,
502.82	and when it's folded, it can spin.
504.66	You don't need reverse.
504.66	You don't need parallel parking.
507.94	You just spin and go directly in.
509.58	(Laughter)
511.18	So we've been working
511.18	with a company to commercialize this.
513.98	My PhD student Ryan Chin
513.98	presented these early ideas
517.1	two years ago at a TEDx conference.
519.78	So what's interesting is,
522.3	then if you begin to add
522.3	new things to it, like autonomy,
525.14	you get out of the car,
525.14	you park at your destination,
527.939	you pat it on the butt, it goes
527.939	and it parks itself, it charges itself,
531.78	and you can get something
531.78	like seven times as many vehicles
536.38	in a given area as conventional cars,
539.74	and we think this is the future.
541.34	Actually, we could do this today.
541.34	It's not really a problem.
545.06	We can combine shared use
545.06	and folding and autonomy
548.62	and we get something
548.62	like 28 times the land utilization
551.94	with that kind of strategy.
553.62	One of our graduate students then says,
555.502	well, how does a driverless car
555.502	communicate with pedestrians?
559.66	You have nobody to make eye contact with.
561.86	You don't know
561.86	if it's going to run you over.
564.02	So he's developing strategies
565.62	so the vehicle can communicate
565.62	with pedestrians, so --
568.22	(Laughter)
569.66	So the headlights are eyeballs,
569.66	the pupils can dilate,
572.62	we have directional audio,
572.62	we can throw sound directly at people.
576.82	What I love about this project
578.3	is he solved a problem
578.3	that doesn't exist yet, so --
581.94	(Laughter)
584.9	We also think that we can
584.9	democratize access to bike lanes.
588.78	You know, bike lanes are mostly used
588.78	by young guys in stretchy pants. So --
592.7	(Laughter)
594.1	We think we can develop a vehicle
594.1	that operates on bike lanes,
597.94	accessible to elderly and disabled,
597.94	women in skirts, businesspeople,
602.94	and address the issues
602.94	of energy congestion, mobility,
605.54	aging and obesity simultaneously.
607.82	That's our challenge.
609.06	This is an early design
609.06	for this little three-wheel.
611.94	It's an electronic bike.
613.46	You have to pedal
613.46	to operate it in a bike lane,
617.22	but if you're an older person,
617.22	that's a switch.
619.86	If you're a healthy person, you might
619.86	have to work really hard to go fast.
623.66	You can dial in 40 calories
623.66	going into work
625.98	and 500 going home,
625.98	when you can take a shower.
628.66	We hope to have that built this fall.
632.94	Housing is another area
632.94	where we can really improve.
636.34	Mayor Menino in Boston says
638.54	lack of affordable housing
638.54	for young people
641.5	is one of the biggest
641.5	problems the city faces.
644.26	Developers say, OK,
644.26	we'll build little teeny apartments.
647.02	People say, we don't really want to live
647.02	in a little teeny conventional apartment.
651.3	So we're saying, let's build
651.3	a standardized chassis,
655.38	much like our car.
656.74	Let's bring advanced technology
656.74	into the apartment,
661.86	technology-enabled infill,
664.42	give people the tools
664.42	within this open-loft chassis
669.42	to go through a process of defining
671.26	what their needs
671.26	and values and activities are,
674.22	and then a matching algorithm
674.22	will match a unique assembly
677.82	of integrated infill components,
679.82	furniture, and cabinetry,
679.82	that are personalized to that individual,
684.94	and they give them the tools
686.34	to go through the process
686.34	and to refine it,
688.38	and it's something like working
688.38	with an architect,
690.78	where the dialogue starts
692.06	when you give an alternative
692.06	to a person to react to.
698.06	Now, the most interesting
698.06	implementation of that for us
702.78	is when you can begin
702.78	to have robotic walls,
704.86	so your space can convert
704.86	from exercise to a workplace,
708.7	if you run a virtual company.
710.46	You have guests over,
711.634	you have two guest rooms
711.634	that are developed.
715.34	You have a conventional
715.34	one-bedroom arrangement
719.22	when you need it.
720.448	Maybe that's most of the time.
722	You have a dinner party.
723.18	The table folds out to fit 16 people
723.18	in otherwise a conventional one-bedroom,
727.26	or maybe you want a dance studio.
728.9	I mean, architects have been thinking
728.9	about these ideas for a long time.
732.34	What we need to do now,
734.58	develop things that can scale
734.58	to those 300 million Chinese people
740.1	that would like to live in the city,
740.1	and very comfortably.
744.26	We think we can make
744.26	a very small apartment
746.58	that functions as if it's twice as big
746.58	by utilizing these strategies.
751.94	I don't believe in smart homes.
751.94	That's sort of a bogus concept.
755.5	I think you have to build dumb homes
755.5	and put smart stuff in it.
758.74	(Laughter)
761.02	And so we've been working
761.02	on a chassis of the wall itself.
766.46	You know, standardized platform
768.02	with the motors and the battery
768.02	when it operates,
770.82	little solenoids that will lock it
770.82	in place and get low-voltage power.
775.38	We think this can all be standardized,
777.22	and then people can personalize the stuff
777.22	that goes into that wall,
781.18	and like the car, we can integrate
781.18	all kinds of sensing
783.9	to be aware of human activity,
786.3	so if there's a baby
786.3	or a puppy in the way,
789.62	you won't have a problem.
790.86	(Laughter)
791.9	So the developers say,
791.9	well, this is great.
794.66	OK, so if we have a conventional building,
794.66	we have a fixed envelope,
798.74	maybe we can put in 14 units.
800.82	If they function
800.82	as if they're twice as big,
802.94	we can get 28 units in.
804.5	That means twice as much parking, though.
806.549	Parking's really expensive.
807.88	It's about 70,000 dollars per space
810.54	to build a conventional parking spot
810.54	inside a building.
814.34	So if you can have folding and autonomy,
817.94	you can do that
817.94	in one-seventh of the space.
820.38	That goes down to 10,000 dollars per car,
822.58	just for the cost of the parking.
824.18	You add shared use,
824.18	and you can even go further.
828.14	We can also integrate
828.14	all kinds of advanced technology
831.22	through this process.
832.46	There's a path to market
832.46	for innovative companies
835.62	to bring technology into the home.
837.3	In this case, a project
837.3	we're doing with Siemens.
839.9	We have sensors on all
839.9	the furniture, all the infill,
842.5	that understands where people are
842.5	and what they're doing.
845.22	Blue light is very efficient,
846.94	so we have these tunable
851.1	It recognizes where the person is,
851.1	what they're doing,
855.26	fills out the light when necessary
855.26	to full spectrum white light,
859.5	and saves maybe 30, 40 percent
859.5	in energy consumption, we think,
865.74	over even conventional
865.74	state-of-the-art lighting systems.
871.22	This just shows you the data
871.22	that comes from the sensors
874.66	that are embedded in the furniture.
876.38	We don't really believe in cameras
876.38	to do things in homes.
879.22	We think these little wireless sensors
879.22	are more effective.
883.22	We think we can also personalize sunlight.
885.5	That's sort of the ultimate
885.5	personalization in some ways.
888.191	So we've looked at articulating
888.191	mirrors of the facade
891.18	that can throw shafts of sunlight
891.18	anywhere into the space,
895.1	therefore allowing you
895.1	to shade most of the glass
897.5	on a hot day like today.
899.74	In this case, she picks up her phone,
901.62	she can map food preparation
901.62	at the kitchen island
906.22	to a particular location of sunlight.
908.66	An algorithm will keep it in that location
908.66	as long as she's engaged in that activity.
913.86	This can be combined
913.86	with LED lighting as well.
918.02	We think workplaces should be shared.
920.14	I mean, this is really
920.14	the workplace of the future, I think.
922.974	This is Starbucks, you know.
924.494	Maybe a third --
925.7	And you see everybody
925.7	has their back to the wall
927.98	and they have food and coffee down the way
930.004	and they're in their own
930.004	little personal bubble.
932.46	We need shared spaces
932.46	for interaction and collaboration.
935.18	We're not doing a very good job with that.
937.42	At the Cambridge Innovation Center,
937.42	you can have shared desks.
941.5	I've spent a lot of time in Finland
941.5	at the design factory of Aalto University,
946.22	where the they have a shared shop
946.22	and shared fab lab, shared quiet spaces,
950.94	electronics spaces, recreation places.
955.1	We think ultimately,
955.1	all of this stuff can come together,
958.58	a new model for mobility,
958.58	a new model for housing,
962.3	a new model for how we live and work,
964.62	a path to market
964.62	for advanced technologies.
967.46	But in the end, the main thing
967.46	we need to focus on are people.
970.389	Cities are all about people.
971.98	They're places for people.
974.02	There's no reason
974.02	why we can't dramatically improve
976.5	the livability and creativity of cities
978.82	like they've done in Melbourne
978.82	with the laneways
982.74	while at the same time
982.74	dramatically reducing CO2 and energy.
987.34	It's a global imperative.
987.34	We have to get this right.
990.7	Thank you.
