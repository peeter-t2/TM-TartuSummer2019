15.26	I'm going to start here.
17.26	This is a hand-lettered sign
19.26	that appeared in a mom and pop bakery
21.26	in my old neighborhood in Brooklyn a few years ago.
24.26	The store owned one of those machines
26.26	that can print on plates of sugar.
28.26	And kids could bring in drawings
30.26	and have the store print a sugar plate
33.26	for the top of their birthday cake.
35.26	But unfortunately, one of the things kids liked to draw
38.26	was cartoon characters.
40.26	They liked to draw the Little Mermaid,
42.26	they'd like to draw a smurf, they'd like to draw Micky Mouse.
45.26	But it turns out to be illegal
47.26	to print a child's drawing of Micky Mouse
50.26	onto a plate of sugar.
53.26	And it's a copyright violation.
55.26	And policing copyright violations
57.26	for children's birthday cakes
59.26	was such a hassle
61.26	that the College Bakery said,
63.26	"""You know what, we're getting out of that business."
65.26	If you're an amateur,
67.26	you don't have access to our machine anymore.
69.26	If you want a printed sugar birthday cake,
71.26	you have to use one of our prefab images --
75.26	"only for professionals."""
77.26	So there's two bills in Congress right now.
80.26	One is called SOPA, the other is called PIPA.
82.26	SOPA stands for the Stop Online Piracy Act.
84.26	It's from the Senate.
86.26	PIPA is short for PROTECTIP,
89.26	which is itself short for
91.26	Preventing Real Online Threats
93.26	to Economic Creativity
95.26	and Theft of Intellectual Property --
97.26	because the congressional aides who name these things
99.26	have a lot of time on their hands.
101.26	And what SOPA and PIPA want to do
103.26	is they want to do this.
105.26	They want to raise the cost
107.26	of copyright compliance
110.26	to the point where people simply get out of the business
113.26	of offering it as a capability to amateurs.
116.26	Now the way they propose to do this
119.26	is to identify sites
121.26	that are substantially infringing on copyright --
123.26	although how those sites are identified
125.26	is never fully specified in the bills --
127.26	and then they want to remove them from the domain name system.
130.26	They want to take them out of the domain name system.
132.26	Now the domain name system
134.26	is the thing that turns human-readable names, like Google.com,
137.26	into the kinds of addresses
139.26	machines expect --
146.26	Now the problem with this model of censorship,
149.26	of identifying a site
151.26	and then trying to remove it from the domain name system,
153.26	is that it won't work.
155.26	And you'd think that would be a pretty big problem for a law,
158.26	but Congress seems not to have let that bother them too much.
160.26	Now the reason it won't work
162.26	is that you can still type 74.125.226.212 into the browser
166.26	or you can make it a clickable link
168.26	and you'll still go to Google.
171.26	So the policing layer
173.26	around the problem
175.26	becomes the real threat of the act.
179.26	Now to understand how Congress came to write a bill
182.26	that won't accomplish its stated goals,
185.26	but will produce a lot of pernicious side effects,
187.26	you have to understand a little bit about the back story.
189.26	And the back story is this:
191.26	SOPA and PIPA, as legislation,
193.26	were drafted largely by media companies
196.26	that were founded in the 20th century.
198.26	The 20th century was a great time to be a media company,
200.26	because the thing you really had on your side was scarcity.
203.26	If you were making a TV show,
205.26	it didn't have to be better than all other TV shows ever made;
209.26	it only had to be better
211.26	than the two other shows
213.26	that were on at the same time --
215.26	which is a very low threshold
217.26	of competitive difficulty.
220.26	Which meant
222.26	that if you fielded average content,
224.26	you got a third of the U.S. public for free --
227.26	tens of millions of users
230.26	for simply doing something
232.26	that wasn't too terrible.
234.26	This is like having a license to print money
236.26	and a barrel of free ink.
238.26	But technology moved on, as technology is wont to do.
241.26	And slowly, slowly, at the end of the 20th century,
244.26	that scarcity started to get eroded --
246.26	and I don't mean by digital technology;
248.26	I mean by analog technology.
250.26	Cassette tapes, video cassette recorders,
252.26	even the humble Xerox machine
254.26	created new opportunities
256.26	for us to behave in ways
258.26	that astonished the media business.
260.26	Because it turned out
262.26	we're not really couch potatoes.
264.26	We don't really like to only consume.
267.26	We do like to consume,
269.26	but every time one of these new tools came along,
272.26	it turned out we also like to produce
274.26	and we like to share.
276.26	And this freaked the media businesses out --
278.26	it freaked them out every time.
280.26	Jack Valenti, who was the head lobbyist
282.26	for the Motion Picture Association of America,
284.26	once likened the ferocious video cassette recorder
288.26	to Jack the Ripper
290.26	and poor, helpless Hollywood
292.26	to a woman at home alone.
295.26	That was the level of rhetoric.
297.26	And so the media industries
299.26	begged, insisted, demanded
301.26	that Congress do something.
303.26	And Congress did something.
305.26	By the early 90s, Congress passed the law
307.26	that changed everything.
310.26	And that law was called the Audio Home Recording Act
312.26	of 1992.
314.26	What the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 said was,
317.26	look, if people are taping stuff off the radio
319.26	and then making mixtapes for their friends,
322.26	that is not a crime. That's okay.
325.26	Taping and remixing
327.26	and sharing with your friends is okay.
330.26	If you make lots and lots of high quality copies and you sell them,
332.26	that's not okay.
334.26	But this taping business,
336.26	fine, let it go.
338.26	And they thought that they clarified the issue,
341.26	because they'd set out a clear distinction
343.26	between legal and illegal copying.
345.26	But that wasn't what the media businesses wanted.
348.26	They had wanted Congress
350.26	to outlaw copying full-stop.
353.26	So when the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 was passed,
356.26	the media businesses gave up on the idea
360.26	of legal versus illegal distinctions for copying
362.26	because it was clear
364.26	that if Congress was acting in their framework,
366.26	they might actually increase the rights of citizens
370.26	to participate in our own media environment.
372.26	So they went for plan B.
374.26	It took them a while to formulate plan B.
376.26	Plan B appeared in its first full-blown form
378.26	in 1998 --
380.26	something called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
383.26	It was a complicated piece of legislation, a lot of moving parts.
385.26	But the main thrust of the DMCA
388.26	was that it was legal to sell you
390.26	uncopyable digital material --
392.26	except that there's no such things as uncopyable digital material.
395.26	It would be, as Ed Felton once famously said,
397.26	"""Like handing out water"
399.26	"that wasn't wet."""
401.26	Bits are copyable. That's what computers do.
404.26	That is a side effect of their ordinary operation.
407.26	So in order to fake the ability
409.26	to sell uncopyable bits,
411.26	the DMCA also made it legal
413.26	to force you to use systems
416.26	that broke the copying function of your devices.
419.26	Every DVD player and game player
421.26	and television and computer you brought home --
424.26	no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it --
427.26	could be broken by the content industries,
430.26	if they wanted to set that as a condition of selling you the content.
433.26	And to make sure you didn't realize,
436.26	or didn't enact their capabilities
439.26	as general purpose computing devices,
441.26	they also made it illegal
443.26	for you to try to reset
445.26	the copyability of that content.
447.26	The DMCA marks the moment
449.26	when the media industries
451.26	gave up on the legal system
453.26	of distinguishing between legal and illegal copying
456.26	and simply tried to prevent copying
459.26	through technical means.
461.26	Now the DMCA had, and is continuing to have, a lot of complicated effects,
464.26	but in this one domain, limiting sharing,
467.26	it has mostly not worked.
469.26	And the main reason it hasn't worked
471.26	is the Internet has turned out to be far more popular and far more powerful
474.26	than anyone imagined.
477.26	The mixtape, the fanzine,
479.26	that was nothing compared to what we're seeing now
481.26	with the Internet.
483.26	We are in a world
485.26	where most American citizens
487.26	over the age of 12
489.26	share things with each other online.
491.26	We share written things, we share images,
493.26	we share audio, we share video.
495.26	Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've made.
497.26	Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've found.
499.26	Some of the stuff we share
501.26	is stuff we've made out of what we've found,
503.26	and all of it horrifies those industries.
506.26	So PIPA and SOPA
508.26	are round two.
510.26	But where the DMCA was surgical --
512.26	we want to go down into your computer,
515.26	we want to go down into your television set, down into your game machine,
518.26	and prevent it from doing
520.26	what they said it would do at the store --
522.26	PIPA and SOPA are nuclear
524.26	and they're saying, we want to go anywhere in the world
528.26	and censor content.
530.26	Now the mechanism, as I said, for doing this,
533.26	is you need to take out anybody
536.26	pointing to those IP addresses.
538.26	You need to take them out of search engines,
540.26	you need to take them out of online directories,
542.26	you need to take them out of user lists.
545.26	And because the biggest producers of content on the Internet
549.26	are not Google and Yahoo,
552.26	they're us,
554.26	we're the people getting policed.
556.26	Because in the end,
558.26	the real threat
561.26	to the enactment of PIPA and SOPA
564.26	is our ability to share things with one another.
567.26	So what PIPA and SOPA risk doing
570.26	is taking a centuries-old legal concept,
573.26	innocent until proven guilty,
575.26	and reversing it --
577.26	guilty until proven innocent.
579.26	You can't share
581.26	until you show us
584.26	that you're not sharing something
586.26	we don't like.
588.26	Suddenly, the burden of proof for legal versus illegal
591.26	falls affirmatively on us
593.26	and on the services
595.26	that might be offering us any new capabilities.
598.26	And if it costs even a dime
601.26	to police a user,
603.26	that will crush a service
605.26	with a hundred million users.
607.26	So this is the Internet they have in mind.
609.26	Imagine this sign everywhere --
612.26	except imagine it doesn't say College Bakery,
615.26	imagine it says YouTube
617.26	and Facebook and Twitter.
619.26	Imagine it says TED,
621.26	because the comments can't be policed
624.26	at any acceptable cost.
627.26	The real effects of SOPA and PIPA
630.26	are going to be different than the proposed effects.
633.26	The threat, in fact,
635.26	is this inversion of the burden of proof,
638.26	where we suddenly
640.26	are all treated like thieves
642.26	at every moment we're given the freedom to create,
645.26	to produce or to share.
648.26	And the people who provide those capabilities to us --
651.26	the YouTubes, the Facebooks, the Twitters and TEDs --
654.26	are in the business
656.26	of having to police us,
658.26	or being on the hook for contributory infringement.
661.26	There's two things you can do
663.26	to help stop this --
665.26	a simple thing and a complicated thing,
668.26	an easy thing and a hard thing.
670.26	The simple thing, the easy thing, is this:
672.26	if you're an American citizen,
674.26	call your representative, call your senator.
677.26	When you look at
680.26	the people who co-signed on the SOPA bill,
683.26	people who've co-signed on PIPA,
685.26	what you see is that they have cumulatively received
688.26	millions and millions of dollars
691.26	from the traditional media industries.
693.26	You don't have millions and millions of dollars,
695.26	but you can call your representatives,
697.26	and you can remind them that you vote,
700.26	and you can ask not to be treated like a thief,
703.26	and you can suggest that you would prefer
705.26	that the Internet not be broken.
708.26	And if you're not an American citizen,
710.26	you can contact American citizens that you know
712.26	and encourage them to do the same.
714.26	Because this seems like a national issue,
716.26	but it is not.
718.26	These industries will not be content
720.26	with breaking our Internet.
722.26	If they break it, they will break it for everybody.
725.26	That's the easy thing.
727.26	That's the simple thing.
729.26	The hard thing is this:
731.26	get ready, because more is coming.
734.26	SOPA is simply a reversion of COICA,
737.26	which was purposed last year, which did not pass.
739.26	And all of this goes back
741.26	to the failure of the DMCA
743.26	to disallow sharing as a technical means.
745.26	And the DMCA goes back to the Audio Home Recording Act,
748.26	which horrified those industries.
750.26	Because the whole business
752.26	of actually suggesting that someone is breaking the law
755.26	and then gathering evidence and proving that,
757.26	that turns out to be really inconvenient.
760.26	"""We'd prefer not to do that,"""
762.26	says the content industries.
764.26	And what they want is not to have to do that.
767.26	They don't want legal distinctions
769.26	between legal and illegal sharing.
771.26	They just want the sharing to go away.
773.26	PIPA and SOPA are not oddities, they're not anomalies,
776.26	they're not events.
778.26	They're the next turn of this particular screw,
781.26	which has been going on 20 years now.
783.26	And if we defeat these, as I hope we do,
785.26	more is coming.
787.26	Because until we convince Congress
792.26	that the way to deal with copyright violation
795.26	is the way copyright violation was dealt with with Napster, with YouTube,
799.26	which is to have a trial with all the presentation of evidence
802.26	and the hashing out of facts and the assessment of remedies
805.26	that goes on in democratic societies.
807.26	That's the way to handle this.
809.26	In the meantime,
811.26	the hard thing to do is to be ready.
813.26	Because that's the real message of PIPA and SOPA.
815.26	Time Warner has called
817.26	and they want us all back on the couch,
819.26	just consuming --
821.26	not producing, not sharing --
823.26	"and we should say, ""No."""
825.26	Thank you.
827.26	(Applause)
