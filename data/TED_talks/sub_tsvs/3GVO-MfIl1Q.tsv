78.98	(Applause)
84.657	So, that's what I've done with my life.
86.623	(Laughter)
88.105	(Applause)
90.737	Thank you.
91.914	(Applause)
97.312	As a kid, I grew up on a farm in Florida,
99.833	and I did what most little kids do.
101.788	I played a little baseball,
101.788	did a few other things like that,
105.524	but I always had the sense
105.524	of being an outsider,
107.834	and it wasn't until I saw
107.834	pictures in the magazines
110.699	that a couple other guys skate, I thought,
112.976	"""Wow, that's for me,"" you know?"
114.52	Because there was no coach
114.52	standing directly over you,
117.144	and these guys,
117.144	they were just being themselves.
119.424	There was no opponent
119.424	directly across from you.
121.67	And I loved that sense,
121.67	so I started skating
124.962	when I was about 10 years old, in 1977,
128.235	and when I did,
128.235	I picked it up pretty quickly.
131.38	In fact, here's some footage
131.38	from about 1984.
134.933	It wasn't until 79
134.933	I won my first amateur championship,
140.076	and then, by 81, I was 14,
140.076	and I won my first world championship,
146.222	which was amazing to me,
148.414	and in a very real sense,
148.414	that was the first real victory I had.
151.503	Oh, watch this.
152.692	This is a Casper slide,
152.692	where the board's upside down.
155.251	Mental note on that one.
156.863	(Laughter)
158.347	And this one here?
159.851	An ollie.
162.7	So, as she mentioned,
162.7	that is overstated for sure,
166.899	but that's why they called me
166.899	the godfather of modern street skating.
171.197	Here's some images of that.
178.041	Now, I was about halfway
178.041	through my pro career
181.072	in, I would say, the mid-'80s.
184.439	Freestyle itself -- we developed
184.439	all these flat ground tricks, as you saw,
188.195	but there was evolving
188.195	a new kind of skateboarding,
191.478	where guys were taking it to the streets,
191.478	and they were using that ollie,
196.322	like I showed you.
197.73	They were using it to get up
197.73	onto stuff like bleachers and handrails
201.077	and over stairwells
201.077	and all kinds of cool stuff.
203.905	So it was evolving upwards.
206.178	In fact, when someone tells you
206.178	they're a skater today,
208.91	they pretty much mean a street skater,
210.905	because freestyle, it took about
210.905	five years for it to die,
214.215	"and at that stage, I'd been a ""champion"""
214.215	champion for 11 years, which --
220.294	Phew!
221.76	And suddenly, it was over for me,
221.76	that's it -- it was gone.
225.333	They took my pro model off the shelf,
227.821	which was essentially
227.821	pronouncing you dead, publicly.
230.657	That's how you make your money, you know?
232.644	You have a signature board
232.644	and wheels and shoes and clothes.
235.964	I had all that stuff, and it's gone.
239.051	The crazy thing was, there was
239.051	a really liberating sense about it,
242.488	because I no longer had to protect
242.488	my record as a champion.
247.098	"""Champion,"" again."
248.302	Champion sounds so goofy,
248.302	but it's what it was, right?
250.877	What drew me to
250.877	skateboarding, the freedom,
254.503	was now restored,
254.503	where I could just create things,
257.078	because that's where the joy
257.078	was for me, always,
259.954	was creating new stuff.
262.148	The other thing that I had
262.148	was a deep well of tricks to draw from
265.703	that were rooted
265.703	in these flat ground tricks.
267.956	Stuff the normal guys were doing
267.956	was very much different.
270.978	So, as humbling and rotten as it was â€”
272.832	And believe me, it was rotten.
274.564	I would go to skate spots,
274.564	"and I was already ""famous guy,"" right?"
278.926	And everyone thought I was good,
280.762	but in this new terrain, I was horrible.
283.08	So people would go,
283.08	"""Oh, what happened to Mullen?"""
287.382	(Laughter)
289.245	So, humbling as it was, I began again.
291.909	Here are some tricks that I started
291.909	to bring to that new terrain.
296.38	And again, there's this undergirding
296.38	layer of influence of freestyle --
301.013	Oh, that one?
302.803	That's, like, the hardest
302.803	thing I've ever done.
306.376	OK, look at that, it's a Darkslide.
308.111	See how it's sliding on the backside?
311.332	Those are super fun,
311.332	and, actually, not that hard.
314.2	You know, at the very root
314.2	of that, see, Caspers,
316.816	see how you throw it?
319.512	Simple as that, right? No biggie.
322.015	And your front foot,
322.015	the way it grabs it --
326.761	I'd seen someone slide
326.761	on the back of the board like that,
329.552	"and I was like, ""How can I get it over?"""
331.498	Because that had not yet been done.
333.228	And then it dawned on me,
333.228	and here's part of what I'm saying.
336.135	I had an infrastructure.
336.135	I had this deep layer,
338.352	where it was like, oh my gosh,
338.352	it's just your foot.
340.804	It's just the way
340.804	you throw your board over.
342.9	Just let the ledge do that, and it's easy,
345.184	and the next thing you know,
345.184	there's 20 more tricks
347.608	based out of the variations.
349.12	So that's the kind of thing --
349.12	here, check this out,
351.777	here's another way,
351.777	and I won't overdo this.
353.862	A little indulgent, I understand.
355.54	There's something called a Primo slide.
359.642	It is the funnest trick ever to do.
365.528	It's like skimboarding.
368.052	And this one, look how it slides
368.052	sideways, every which way?
370.985	OK, so when you're skating,
370.985	and you take a fall,
373.837	the board slips that way or that way;
373.837	it's kind of predictable.
376.938	This? It goes every which way --
376.938	it's like a cartoon, the falls,
380.006	and that's what I love the most about it.
382.118	It's so much fun to do.
383.768	In fact, when I started doing them,
383.768	I remember, because I got hurt.
387.053	I had to get a knee surgery, right?
388.864	So there were a couple of weeks
388.864	where I couldn't skate at all.
393.131	It would give out on me,
393.131	and I would watch the guys,
396.041	I'd go to this warehouse
396.041	where a lot of the guys were skating,
398.974	my friends, and I was like,
400.318	"""I've got to do something new,"
400.318	I want to do something new.
403.086	"I want to start fresh."""
404.285	And so the night before my surgery,
404.285	I'd watched, and I was like,
407.331	"""How am I going to do this?"""
408.703	So I ran up, and I jumped on my board,
410.557	and I Cavemanned, and I flipped it down,
412.529	and I remember thinking,
412.529	I landed so light-footed, thinking,
415.448	if my knee gives, they'll just have
415.448	more work to do in the morning.
418.648	(Laughter)
419.843	And so, when it was the crazy thing.
421.917	I don't know how many
421.917	of you guys have had surgery, but --
424.657	(Laughter)
426.12	you are so helpless, right?
427.436	You're on this gurney
427.436	and you're watching the ceiling go by,
430.286	every time, it's always that,
431.691	and right when they're putting
431.691	the mask on you before you go to sleep,
435.053	all I was thinking is,
435.053	"""Man, when I wake up and I get better,"
438.251	the first thing I'm going to do
438.251	"is film that trick."""
441.141	And indeed I did, it was the very first
441.141	thing I filmed, which was awesome.
446.084	I told you a little bit
446.084	about the evolution of the tricks.
450.004	Consider that content, in a sense.
452.234	What we do as street skaters is,
452.234	you have these tricks --
456.105	Say I'm working on Darkslides, or a Primo,
458.147	that you guys know this stuff now.
460.054	(Laughter)
461.844	What you do is, you cruise
461.844	around the same streets
464.202	that you've seen a hundred times,
466.013	but suddenly, because
466.013	you already have something
468.806	in this fixed domain of this target,
468.806	it's like, what will match this trick?
474.051	How can I expand, how can the context,
477.091	how can the environment change
477.091	the very nature of what I do?
480.168	So you drive and drive and drive,
480.168	and, actually I've got to admit,
484.016	just because I was struggling
484.016	with this because I'm here,
486.764	but I'll just say it,
486.764	is, I cannot tell you,
489.273	not only to be here in front of you,
491.042	but what a privilege it is
491.042	to be at US campus,
493.592	because I have been escorted off
493.592	of this campus so many times.
497.652	(Laughter)
500.453	(Applause)
502.483	So let me give you another example
502.483	of how context shapes content.
508.337	This is a place not that far from here,
508.337	It's a rotten neighborhood.
511.666	Your first consideration is,
511.666	am I going to get beat up?
514.262	You go out and -- See this wall?
516.739	It's fairly mellow, and it's beckoning
516.739	to do bank tricks, right?
522.624	But there's this other aspect
522.624	of it for wheelies,
525.368	so check this out.
527.348	There's a few tricks, again,
528.882	how environment changes
528.882	the nature of your tricks.
531.307	Freestyle oriented,
531.307	manual down -- wheelie down.
534.504	Watch, this one? Oh, I love this,
534.504	it's like surfing, this one,
537.602	the way you catch it.
539.18	This one, a little sketchy
539.18	going backwards,
542.354	and watch the back foot.
545.116	Oops --
546.291	(Laughter)
547.728	Mental note right there.
549.252	Again, we'll get back to that.
550.874	(Laughter)
552.049	Here, back foot, back foot.
554.438	OK, up there?
555.635	That was called a 360 flip.
556.968	Notice how the board flipped
556.968	and spun this way, both axes.
561.494	And another example
561.494	of how the context changed,
566.053	and the creative process
566.053	for me and for most skaters,
570.071	is, you go, you get out of the car,
570.071	you check for security,
573.317	you check for stuff.
574.498	(Laughter)
575.717	It's funny, you get to know
575.717	their rhythms, you know,
578.212	the guys that cruise around --
579.859	(Laughter)
581.253	Skateboarding is such
581.253	a humbling thing, man.
583.372	No matter how good you are,
583.372	you've still got to deal with --
586.296	So you hit this wall, and when I hit it,
588.351	the first thing you do
588.351	is you fall forward,
590.643	and I'm like, all right, all right.
592.357	As you adjust ...
595.105	you punch it up,
595.105	and then when I would do that,
597.464	it was throwing my shoulder this way ...
600.067	which as I was doing it, I was like,
600.067	"""Oh wow, that's begging for a 360 flip,"""
604.949	because that's how
604.949	you load up for a 360 flip.
607.928	And so this is what I want
607.928	to emphasize that, as you can imagine,
611.632	all of these tricks are made
611.632	of submovements,
615.234	executive motor functions,
616.576	more granular to the degree
616.576	to which I can't quite tell you,
619.638	but one thing I do know is,
621.018	every trick is made of combining two
621.018	or three or four or five movements.
625.01	And so, as I'm going up,
625.01	these things are floating around,
628.299	and you have to sort of
628.299	let the cognitive mind rest back,
631.058	pull it back a little bit,
632.348	and let your intuition go
632.348	as you feel these things.
634.803	And these submovements
634.803	are kind of floating around,
637.334	and as the wall hits you,
637.334	they connect themselves to an extent,
640.322	and that's when the cognitive mind:
640.322	"""Oh, 360 flip, I'm going to make that."""
643.921	So that's how that works
643.921	to me, the creative process,
646.45	the process itself, of street skating.
648.362	So, next -- Oh, mind you ...
649.761	(Laughter)
650.851	Those are the community.
652.039	These are some of the best
652.039	skaters in the world.
654.712	These are my friends --
654.712	oh my gosh, they're such good people.
658.307	And the beauty of skateboarding is that,
660.839	no one guy is the best.
662.827	In fact, I know this is rotten to say,
662.827	they're my friends,
666.223	but a couple of them actually don't look
666.223	that comfortable on their board.
669.723	What makes them great is the degree
669.723	to which they use their skateboarding
674.763	to individuate themselves.
676.046	Every single one of these guys,
676.046	you look at them,
678.393	you can see a silhouette
678.393	of them, and you realize,
680.831	"""Oh, that's him,"
680.831	that's Haslam, that's Koston,
683.144	"there's these guys, these are the guys."""
686.323	And skaters, I think
686.323	they tend to be outsiders
690.401	who seek a sense of belonging,
693.766	but belonging on their own terms.
696.704	And real respect is given
696.704	by how much we take what other guys do,
701.371	these basic tricks, 360 flips,
701.371	we take that, we make it our own,
706.291	and then we contribute
706.291	back to the community
708.601	the inner way that edifies
708.601	the community itself.
711.885	The greater the contribution,
714.119	the more we express
714.119	and form our individuality,
718.372	which is so important to a lot of us
718.372	who feel like rejects to begin with.
722.699	The summation of that
725.281	gives us something we could never
725.281	achieve as an individual.
729.784	I should say this.
730.975	There's some sort of beautiful symmetry
732.873	that the degree to which
732.873	we connect to a community
735.704	is in proportion to our individuality,
738.349	which we are expressing by what we do.
741.322	Next,
742.502	these guys, very similar community
742.502	that's extremely conducive to innovation.
746.924	(Laughter)
748.134	Notice a couple of these shots
748.134	from the police department.
751.707	But it is quite similar,
751.707	I mean, what is it to hack, right?
754.505	It's knowing a technology so well
754.505	that you can manipulate it
757.813	and steer it to do things
757.813	it was never intended to do, right?
762.196	And they're not all bad.
763.555	You can be a Linux kernel hacker,
763.555	make it more stable, right?
767.649	More safe, more secure.
768.911	You can be an iOS hacker,
770.865	make your iPhone do stuff
770.865	it wasn't supposed to.
774.159	Not authorized, but not illegal.
776.574	And then, you've got
776.574	some of these guys, right?
778.943	What they do is very similar
778.943	to our creative process.
781.509	They connect disparate information,
784.625	and they bring it together in a way
784.625	that a security analyst doesn't expect.
790.672	It doesn't make them good people,
792.786	but it's at the heart of engineering,
795.102	at the heart of a creative community,
795.102	an innovative community,
799.656	and the open source community,
799.656	the basic ethos of it
802.545	is, take what other people do,
802.545	make it better,
806.077	give it back so we all rise further.
808.265	Very similar communities, very similar.
810.678	We have our edgier sides, too.
812.693	(Laughter)
813.922	It's funny, my dad was right.
815.409	These are my peers.
817.908	But I respect what they do,
817.908	and they respect what I do,
820.516	because they can do things,
820.516	it's amazing what they can do.
823.289	In fact, one of them,
824.945	he was Ernst &amp; Young's Entrepreneur
824.945	of the Year for San Diego County,
829.168	so they're not -- you never know
829.168	who you're dealing with.
832.252	We've all had some degree of fame.
835.758	In fact, I've had so much success
835.758	that I strangely always feel unworthy of.
840.826	I've had a patent, and that was cool,
840.826	and we started a company,
843.809	and it grew, and it became the biggest,
845.955	and then it went down,
845.955	and then it became the biggest again,
848.864	which is harder than the first time,
848.864	and then we sold it,
851.559	and then we sold it again.
853.104	So I've had some success.
855.19	And in the end, when you've had
855.19	all of these things,
857.691	what is it that continues to drive you?
859.579	As I mentioned, the knee stuff
859.579	and these things,
861.888	what is it that will punch you?
863.478	Because it's not just the mind.
865.323	What is it that will punch you
865.323	and make you do something
868.192	and bring it to another level,
868.192	and when you've had it all,
871.234	sometimes, guys, they die on the vine
871.234	with all of that talent,
875.492	and one of the things
875.492	we've had, all of us, is fame --
878.184	I think the best kind of fame,
878.184	because you can take it off.
881.018	I've been all around the world,
883.088	and there will be a thousand kids
883.088	crying out your name,
885.732	and it's such a weird,
885.732	visceral experience.
887.804	It's like, it's disorienting.
889.435	And you get in a car, and you drive away,
891.537	and 10-minute drive, and you get out,
894.431	and no one gives a rat's who you are.
896.266	(Laughter)
897.656	And it gives you that clarity
897.656	of perspective of, man, I'm just me,
900.961	and popularity, what does that
900.961	really mean again?
903.695	Not much.
905.14	It's peer respect that drives us.
907.323	That's the one thing
907.323	that makes us do what we do.
909.668	I've had over a dozen bones,
909.668	this guy, over, eight, 10 concussions,
913.773	to the point where it's comedy, right?
916.317	It is actually comedy, they mess with him.
919.072	(Laughter)
920.65	Next,
921.845	and this is something deeper.
926.25	I think I was on tour when I was reading
926.25	one of the Feynman biographies.
929.786	It was the red one or the blue one.
931.833	And he made this statement
931.833	that was so profound to me.
939.101	It was that the Nobel Prize
939.101	was the tombstone on all great work,
944.086	and it resonated because
944.086	I had won 35 out of 36 contests
947.945	that I'd entered over 11 years,
947.945	and it made me bananas.
951.31	In fact, winning
951.31	isn't the word, I won it once.
953.58	The rest of the time,
953.58	you're just defending,
955.656	and you get into this,
955.656	turtle posture, you know?
958.255	Where you're not doing --
958.255	it usurped the joy of what I loved to do
961.389	because I was no longer doing it
961.389	to create and have fun,
964.565	and when it died out from under me,
966.3	that was one of the most
966.3	liberating things,
968.38	because I could create.
969.99	And look, I understand that
969.99	I am on the very edge of preachy, here.
974.709	I'm not here to do that.
975.897	It's just that I'm in front
975.897	of a very privileged audience.
978.663	If you guys aren't already
978.663	leaders in your community,
981.567	you probably will be,
981.567	and if there's anything I can give you
984.659	that will transcend what I've gotten
984.659	from skateboarding,
987.863	the only things of meaning,
987.863	I think, and of permanence,
990.909	it's not fame, it's not all these things.
992.991	What it is, is that there's
992.991	an intrinsic value in creating something
996.926	for the sake of creating it,
998.743	and better than that,
998.743	because I'm 46 years old, or I'll be 46,
1002.938	and how pathetic is that
1002.938	I'm still skateboarding, but there is --
1006.588	there is this beauty in dropping it
1006.588	into a community of your own making,
1012.727	and seeing it dispersed,
1012.727	and seeing younger, more talented,
1016.038	just different talent, take it to levels
1016.038	you can never imagine,
1019.303	because that lives on.
1020.991	So thank you for your time.
1022.717	(Applause)
1032.616	Kristina Holly: I have a question for you.
1034.862	(Applause)
1038.634	So you've really reinvented yourself
1038.634	in the past, from freestyle to street,
1042.555	and, I think it was about four years ago
1042.555	you officially retired.
1045.864	Is that it? What's next?
1049.15	Rodney Mullen: That's a good question.
1049.15	KG: Something tells me it's not the end.
1052.903	RM: Yeah. Every time you think
1052.903	you've chased something down,
1056.711	it's funny, no matter how good you are,
1056.711	and I know guys like this,
1059.872	it feels like you're polishing
1059.872	a turd, you know?
1062.262	(Laughter)
1065.581	And I thought, the only way
1065.581	I can extend this
1068.052	is to change something infrastructural.
1070.88	And so that's what I proceeded to do,
1070.88	through a long story,
1074.142	one of desperation, so if I do it,
1074.142	rather than talk about it,
1078.427	if I do it, you'll be the first to know.
1080.394	KG: All right, we won't ask you any more.
1080.394	RM: You'll get a text.
1083.42	KG: Right, thank you, good job.
1083.42	RM: Thank you. Thank you.
1086.419	(Applause)
