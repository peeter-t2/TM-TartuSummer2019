13.798	I was three months pregnant with twins
16.295	when my husband Ross and I
16.295	went to my second sonogram.
21.221	I was 35 years old at the time,
23.563	and I knew that that meant
23.563	we had a higher risk
26.907	of having a child with a birth defect.
29.907	So, Ross and I researched
29.907	the standard birth defects,
32.989	and we felt reasonably prepared.
35.973	Well, nothing would have prepared us
37.942	for the bizarre diagnosis
37.942	that we were about to face.
42.291	The doctor explained
42.291	that one of our twins, Thomas,
45.854	had a fatal birth defect
45.854	called anencephaly.
49.476	This means that his brain
49.476	was not formed correctly
52.894	because part of his skull was missing.
55.663	Babies with this diagnosis
55.663	typically die in utero
59.211	or within a few minutes, hours
59.211	or days of being born.
65.013	But the other twin, Callum,
68.252	appeared to be healthy,
68.252	as far as the doctor could tell,
72.164	and these twins were identical,
76.355	genetically identical.
80.125	So after a lot of questions about
80.125	how this could have possibly happened,
84.761	a selective reduction was mentioned,
87.921	and while this procedure
87.921	was not impossible,
90.846	it posed some unique risks
90.846	for the healthy twin and for me,
95.228	so we decided to carry
95.228	the pregnancy to term.
99.101	So there I was, three months pregnant,
99.101	with two trimesters ahead of me,
103.316	and I had to find a way to manage
103.316	my blood pressure and my stress.
109.268	And it felt like having a roommate
109.268	point a loaded gun at you for six months.
115.553	But I stared down
115.553	the barrel of that gun for so long
120.507	that I saw a light
120.507	at the end of the tunnel.
123.506	While there was nothing we could do
123.506	to prevent the tragedy,
126.634	I wanted to find a way
126.634	for Thomas's brief life
129.121	to have some kind of positive impact.
131.366	So I asked my nurse about organ,
131.366	eye and tissue donation.
136.08	She connected with our local
136.08	organ-procurement organization,
139.625	the Washington Regional
139.625	Transplant Community.
143.359	WRTC explained to me
145.954	that Thomas would probably be too small
145.954	at birth to donate for transplant,
150.379	and I was shocked:
151.553	I didn't even know
151.553	you could be rejected for that.
153.981	But they said that he would be
153.981	a good candidate to donate for research.
158.29	This helped me see Thomas in a new light.
160.345	As opposed to just a victim of a disease,
163.264	I started to see him as a possible key
163.264	to unlock a medical mystery.
168.288	On March 23, 2010,
171.59	the twins were born,
171.59	and they were both born alive.
175.978	And just like the doctor said,
177.668	Thomas was missing
177.668	the top part of his skull,
180.771	but he could nurse,
182.318	drink from a bottle,
183.794	cuddle and grab our fingers
183.794	like a normal baby,
187.117	and he slept in our arms.
190.053	After six days, Thomas died in Ross's arms
193.466	surrounded by our family.
196.846	We called WRTC, who sent a van to our home
201.005	and brought him to Children's
201.005	National Medical Center.
204.751	A few hours later, we got a call to say
204.751	that the recovery was a success,
208.596	and Thomas's donations
208.596	would be going to four different places.
212.159	His cord blood would go
212.159	to Duke University.
215.208	His liver would go to a cell-therapy
215.208	company called Cytonet in Durham.
220.263	His corneas would go
220.263	to Schepens Eye Research Institute,
223.532	which is part of Harvard Medical School,
225.715	and his retinas would go
225.715	to the University of Pennsylvania.
230.083	A few days later, we had a funeral
230.083	with our immediate family,
234.035	including baby Callum,
236.003	and we basically
236.003	closed this chapter in our lives.
239.718	But I did find myself wondering,
239.718	what's happening now?
243.055	What are the researchers learning?
245.13	And was it even worthwhile to donate?
249.019	WRTC invited Ross and I
249.019	to a grief retreat,
252.765	and we met about
255.542	who had donated their loved one's
255.542	organs for transplant.
259.494	Some of them had even received letters
261.919	from the people who received
261.919	their loved one's organs,
264.912	saying thank you.
267.038	I learned that they
267.038	could even meet each other
269.251	if they'd both sign a waiver,
270.713	almost like an open adoption.
272.907	And I was so excited,
272.907	I thought maybe I could write a letter
275.77	or I could get a letter
275.77	and learn about what happened.
278.403	But I was disappointed to learn
279.966	that this process only exists
279.966	for people who donate for transplant.
283.16	So I was jealous.
283.16	I had transplant envy, I guess.
286.446	(Laughter)
288.104	But over the years that followed,
290.024	I learned a lot more about donation,
292.524	and I even got a job in the field.
294.626	And I came up with an idea.
297.879	I wrote a letter that started out,
299.562	"""Dear Researcher."""
302.468	I explained who I was,
304.342	and I asked if they could tell me
304.342	why they requested infant retinas
308.234	in March of 2010,
310.493	and I asked if my family
310.493	could visit their lab.
313.953	I emailed it to the eye bank
313.953	that arranged the donation,
317.073	the Old Dominion Eye Foundation,
319.475	and asked if they could
319.475	send it to the right person.
322.395	They said that they had
322.395	never done this before,
324.65	and they couldn't guarantee a response,
326.563	but they wouldn't be an obstacle,
326.563	and they would deliver it.
330.506	Two days later, I got a response
332.721	from Dr. Arupa Ganguly
332.721	of the University of Pennsylvania.
336.617	She thanked me for the donation,
338.263	and she explained
338.263	that she is studying retinoblastoma,
341.01	which is a deadly cancer of the retina
342.851	that affects children
342.851	under the age of five,
345.001	and she said that yes,
345.001	we were invited to visit her lab.
348.612	So next we talked on the phone,
350.278	and one of the first things she said to me
352.349	was that she couldn't possibly
352.349	imagine how we felt,
355.204	and that Thomas had given
355.204	the ultimate sacrifice,
357.968	and that she seemed
357.968	to feel indebted to us.
360.709	"So I said, ""Nothing against your study,"
363.859	but we didn't actually pick it.
365.549	We donated to the system,
365.549	and the system chose your study.
369.493	"I said, ""And second of all,"
369.493	bad things happen to children every day,
374.407	and if you didn't want these retinas,
376.219	they would probably
376.219	be buried in the ground right now.
378.773	So to be able to participate in your study
382.163	gives Thomas's life
382.163	a new layer of meaning.
385.83	So, never feel guilty
385.83	"about using this tissue."""
389.845	Next, she explained to me how rare it was.
392.403	She had placed a request
392.403	for this tissue six years earlier
396.123	with the National Disease
396.123	Research Interchange.
399.16	She got only one sample of tissue
399.16	that fit her criteria,
402.518	and it was Thomas's.
404.958	Next, we arranged a date for me
404.958	to come visit the lab,
408.712	and we chose March 23, 2015,
408.712	which was the twins' fifth birthday.
414.563	After we hung up, I emailed her
414.563	some pictures of Thomas and Callum,
418.523	and a few weeks later,
418.523	we received this T-shirt in the mail.
423.142	A few months later, Ross, Callum
423.142	and I piled in the car
425.965	and we went for a road trip.
427.58	We met Arupa and her staff,
430.168	and Arupa said that when I told her
430.168	not to feel guilty, that it was a relief,
434.44	and that she hadn't seen it
434.44	from our perspective.
438.09	She also explained that Thomas
438.09	had a secret code name.
442.931	The same way Henrietta Lacks
442.931	is called HeLa,
446.324	Thomas was called RES 360.
449.394	RES means research,
450.816	and 360 means he was the 360th specimen
454.34	over the course of about 10 years.
457.133	She also shared with us a unique document,
461.3	and it was the shipping label
463.809	that sent his retinas
463.809	from DC to Philadelphia.
468.273	This shipping label
468.273	is like an heirloom to us now.
472.304	It's the same way that a military medal
472.304	or a wedding certificate might be.
476.687	Arupa also explained that she is using
476.687	Thomas's retina and his RNA
482.111	to try to inactivate the gene
482.111	that causes tumor formation,
485.545	and she even showed us some results
485.545	that were based on RES 360.
489.959	Then she took us to the freezer
491.817	and she showed us the two samples
491.817	that she still has
495.276	that are still labeled RES 360.
497.622	There's two little ones left.
499.506	She said she saved it
501.058	because she doesn't know
501.058	when she might get more.
504.553	After this, we went to the conference room
506.625	and we relaxed and we had lunch together,
509.259	and the lab staff presented Callum
509.259	with a birthday gift.
514.179	It was a child's lab kit.
516.419	And they also offered him an internship.
518.831	(Laughter)
522.038	So in closing, I have two
522.038	simple messages today.
525.578	One is that most of us probably
525.578	don't think about donating to research.
529.406	I know I didn't.
529.406	I think I'm a normal person.
532.54	But I did it.
533.715	It was a good experience,
533.715	and I recommend it,
535.881	and it brought my family a lot of peace.
537.849	And second is if you work
537.849	with human tissue
540.658	and you wonder about the donor
540.658	and about the family,
543.277	write them a letter.
544.496	Tell them you received it,
544.496	tell them what you're working on,
547.336	and invite them to visit your lab,
549.027	because that visit may be
549.027	even more gratifying for you
551.576	than it is for them.
552.831	And I'd also like to ask you a favor.
554.617	If you're ever successful
554.617	in arranging one of these visits,
557.6	please tell me about it.
560.064	The other part of my family's story
561.784	is that we ended up visiting
561.784	all four facilities
564.12	that received Thomas's donations.
566.206	And we met amazing people
566.206	doing inspiring work.
570.003	The way I see it now
570.003	is that Thomas got into Harvard,
575.128	Duke and Penn --
577.318	(Laughter)
580.667	And he has a job at Cytonet,
583.059	and he has colleagues and he has coworkers
585.868	who are in the top of their fields.
587.653	And they need him
587.653	in order to do their job.
591.137	And a life that once seemed
591.137	brief and insignificant
595.812	revealed itself to be vital,
595.812	everlasting and relevant.
602.224	And I only hope that my life
602.224	can be as relevant.
605.512	Thank you.
606.687	(Applause)
