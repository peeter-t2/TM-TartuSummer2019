16.361	What you have here
17.911	is an electronic cigarette.
22.097	It's something that, since it was
22.097	invented a year or two ago,
25.34	has given me untold happiness.
26.835	(Laughter)
28.04	A little bit of it,
28.04	I think, is the nicotine,
30.499	but there's something
30.499	much bigger than that;
32.733	which is, ever since, in the UK,
32.733	they banned smoking in public places,
38.324	I've never enjoyed
38.324	a drinks party ever again.
41.168	(Laughter)
43.05	And the reason, I only worked out
43.05	just the other day,
46.17	which is: when you go
46.17	to a drinks party and you stand up
48.862	and hold a glass of red wine
48.862	and you talk endlessly to people,
51.846	you don't actually want to spend
51.846	all the time talking.
54.444	It's really, really tiring.
55.939	Sometimes you just want to stand there
55.939	silently, alone with your thoughts.
59.976	Sometimes you just want to stand
59.976	in the corner and stare out of the window.
64.907	Now the problem is, when you can't smoke,
68.105	if you stand and stare
68.105	out of the window on your own,
71.78	you're an antisocial, friendless idiot.
74.026	(Laughter)
76.36	If you stand and stare out of the window
76.36	on your own with a cigarette,
79.789	you're a fucking philosopher.
81.566	(Laughter)
84.393	(Applause)
90.069	So the power of reframing things
94.978	cannot be overstated.
97.458	What we have is exactly
97.458	the same thing, the same activity,
100.854	but one of them makes you feel great
103.196	and the other one,
103.196	with just a small change of posture,
106.921	makes you feel terrible.
109.529	And I think one of the problems
109.529	with classical economics is,
112.458	it's absolutely preoccupied with reality.
114.915	And reality isn't a particularly good
114.915	guide to human happiness.
119.155	Why, for example,
119.155	are pensioners much happier
124.187	than the young unemployed?
126.553	Both of them, after all,
126.553	are in exactly the same stage of life.
129.823	You both have too much time
129.823	on your hands and not much money.
133.616	But pensioners are reportedly
133.616	very, very happy,
136.341	whereas the unemployed
136.341	are extraordinarily unhappy and depressed.
140.641	The reason, I think,
140.641	is that the pensioners believe
143.115	they've chosen to be pensioners,
144.712	whereas the young unemployed
144.712	feel it's been thrust upon them.
149.998	In England, the upper-middle classes have
149.998	actually solved this problem perfectly,
154.058	because they've re-branded unemployment.
156.408	If you're an upper-middle-class
156.408	English person,
158.698	"you call unemployment ""a year off."""
161.05	(Laughter)
163.768	And that's because having a son
163.768	who's unemployed in Manchester
166.836	is really quite embarrassing.
168.787	But having a son
168.787	who's unemployed in Thailand
171.889	is really viewed
171.889	as quite an accomplishment.
173.996	(Laughter)
176.049	But actually, the power
176.049	to re-brand things --
178.396	to understand that
178.396	our experiences, costs, things
183.959	don't actually much depend
183.959	on what they really are,
186.433	but on how we view them --
188.03	I genuinely think can't be overstated.
190.963	There's an experiment
190.963	I think Daniel Pink refers to,
193.443	where you put two dogs in a box
195.986	and the box has an electric floor.
200.616	Every now and then,
200.616	an electric shock is applied to the floor,
205.069	which pains the dogs.
207.92	The only difference is one of the dogs
207.92	has a small button in its half of the box.
211.782	And when it nuzzles the button,
211.782	the electric shock stops.
216.636	The other dog doesn't have the button.
219.164	It's exposed to exactly the same level
219.164	of pain as the dog in the first box,
223.429	but it has no control
223.429	over the circumstances.
227.438	Generally, the first dog
227.438	can be relatively content.
230.357	The second dog lapses
230.357	into complete depression.
234.642	The circumstances of our lives
234.642	may actually matter less to our happiness
238.954	than the sense of control
238.954	we feel over our lives.
243.77	It's an interesting question.
246.529	We ask the question -- the whole
246.529	debate in the Western world
249.631	is about the level of taxation.
251.489	But I think there's another
251.489	debate to be asked,
253.736	which is the level of control
253.736	we have over our tax money,
257.191	that what costs us 10 pounds
257.191	in one context can be a curse;
261.851	what costs us 10 pounds in a different
261.851	context, we may actually welcome.
267.564	You know, pay 20,000 pounds
267.564	in tax toward health,
271.902	and you're merely feeling a mug.
273.855	Pay 20,000 pounds
273.855	to endow a hospital ward,
277.141	and you're called a philanthropist.
280.177	I'm probably in the wrong country
280.177	to talk about willingness to pay tax.
283.602	(Laughter)
285.313	So I'll give you one in return:
285.313	how you frame things really matters.
290.537	"Do you call it ""The bailout of Greece""?"
292.839	"Or ""The bailout of a load of stupid banks"
292.839	"which lent to Greece""?"
296.059	(Laughter)
297.094	Because they are actually the same thing.
299.468	What you call them
299.468	actually affects how you react to them,
303.352	viscerally and morally.
305.41	I think psychological value is great,
305.41	to be absolutely honest.
308.628	One of my great friends,
308.628	a professor called Nick Chater,
311.524	who's the Professor of Decision
311.524	Sciences in London,
314.422	believes we should spend far less time
314.422	looking into humanity's hidden depths,
318.946	and spend much more time
318.946	exploring the hidden shallows.
322.393	I think that's true, actually.
323.929	I think impressions have an insane effect
323.929	on what we think and what we do.
329.027	But what we don't have is a really
329.027	good model of human psychology --
332.634	at least pre-Kahneman, perhaps,
334.943	we didn't have a really good model
334.943	of human psychology
337.931	to put alongside models of engineering,
337.931	of neoclassical economics.
342.828	So people who believed in psychological
342.828	solutions didn't have a model.
346.175	We didn't have a framework.
348.134	This is what Warren Buffett's
348.134	business partner Charlie Munger calls
351.505	"""a latticework on which"
351.505	"to hang your ideas."""
354.707	Engineers, economists,
354.707	classical economists
357.604	all had a very, very robust
357.604	existing latticework
360.559	on which practically
360.559	every idea could be hung.
363.278	We merely have a collection
363.278	of random individual insights
366.698	without an overall model.
368.872	And what that means
368.872	is that, in looking at solutions,
373.335	we've probably given too much priority
376.085	to what I call technical engineering
376.085	solutions, Newtonian solutions,
380.23	and not nearly enough
380.23	to the psychological ones.
382.632	You know my example of the Eurostar:
384.969	six million pounds spent
386.191	to reduce the journey time
386.191	between Paris and London
389.435	by about 40 minutes.
391.829	For 0.01 percent of this money,
391.829	you could have put wi-fi on the trains,
395.701	which wouldn't have reduced
395.701	the duration of the journey,
398.393	but would have improved its enjoyment
398.393	and its usefulness far more.
403.285	For maybe 10 percent of the money,
404.977	you could have paid all of the world's top
404.977	male and female supermodels
408.335	to walk up and down the train
408.335	handing out free Château Pétrus
411.294	to all the passengers.
412.592	(Laughter)
413.658	You'd still have five million
413.658	pounds in change,
416.032	and people would ask
416.032	for the trains to be slowed down.
418.681	(Laughter)
422.799	Why were we not given the chance
422.799	to solve that problem psychologically?
426.185	I think it's because there's an imbalance,
428.693	an asymmetry in the way we treat creative,
428.693	emotionally driven psychological ideas
435.351	versus the way we treat rational,
435.351	numerical, spreadsheet-driven ideas.
440.276	If you're a creative person,
440.276	I think, quite rightly,
442.767	you have to share
442.767	all your ideas for approval
444.926	with people much more rational than you.
446.887	You have to go in
446.887	and have a cost-benefit analysis,
450.175	a feasibility study,
450.175	an ROI study and so forth.
453.252	And I think that's probably right.
455.903	But this does not apply
455.903	the other way around.
458.573	People who have an existing framework --
460.625	an economic framework,
460.625	an engineering framework --
463.028	feel that, actually,
463.028	logic is its own answer.
466.763	What they don't say is,
466.763	"""Well, the numbers all seem to add up,"
469.693	but before I present this idea,
469.693	I'll show it to some really crazy people
473.169	to see if they can come up with
473.169	"something better."""
475.559	And so we -- artificially,
475.559	I think -- prioritize
478.338	what I'd call mechanistic ideas
478.338	over psychological ideas.
482.837	An example of a great psychological idea:
484.893	the single best improvement
484.893	in passenger satisfaction
487.533	on the London Underground,
488.861	per pound spent,
490.455	came when they didn't add
490.455	any extra trains,
492.814	nor change the frequency of the trains;
494.743	they put dot matrix display boards
494.743	on the platforms --
498.877	because the nature of a wait is not just
498.877	dependent on its numerical quality,
502.752	its duration,
504.019	but on the level of uncertainty
504.019	you experience during that wait.
507.457	Waiting seven minutes for a train
507.457	with a countdown clock
510.37	is less frustrating and irritating
512.287	than waiting four minutes,
512.287	knuckle biting, going,
515.25	"""When's this train"
515.25	"going to damn well arrive?"""
518.139	Here's a beautiful example
518.139	of a psychological solution
520.72	deployed in Korea.
521.915	Red traffic lights have a countdown delay.
524.348	It's proven to reduce
524.348	the accident rate in experiments.
527.398	Why?
528.58	Because road rage, impatience and general
528.58	irritation are massively reduced
532.125	when you can actually see
532.125	the time you have to wait.
535.998	In China, not really understanding
535.998	the principle behind this,
538.925	they applied the same principle
538.925	to green traffic lights --
541.688	(Laughter)
545.55	which isn't a great idea.
547.096	You're 200 yards away, you realize
547.096	you've got five seconds to go,
550.21	you floor it.
551.386	(Laughter)
554.733	The Koreans, very assiduously,
554.733	did test both.
557.258	The accident rate goes down
557.258	when you apply this to red traffic lights;
560.617	it goes up when you apply it
560.617	to green traffic lights.
563.229	This is all I'm asking for, really,
563.229	in human decision making,
566.191	is the consideration
566.191	of these three things.
568.32	I'm not asking for the complete primacy
568.32	of one over the other.
571.309	I'm merely saying
571.309	that when you solve problems,
573.573	you should look
573.573	at all three of these equally,
576.079	and you should seek as far as possible
578.304	to find solutions which sit
578.304	in the sweet spot in the middle.
581.187	If you actually look at a great business,
583.182	you'll nearly always see all of these
583.182	three things coming into play.
586.795	Really successful businesses --
588.502	Google is a great, great
588.502	technological success,
591.188	but it's also based
591.188	on a very good psychological insight:
595.354	people believe something
595.354	that only does one thing
597.935	is better at that thing than something
597.935	that does that thing and something else.
602.118	It's an innate thing
602.118	"called ""goal dilution."""
604.848	Ayelet Fishbach has written
604.848	a paper about this.
607.633	Everybody else at the time
607.633	of Google, more or less,
610.147	was trying to be a portal.
611.418	Yes, there's a search function,
611.418	but you also have weather,
614.268	sports scores, bits of news.
617.189	Google understood
617.189	that if you're just a search engine,
619.755	people assume you're a very,
619.755	very good search engine.
622.617	All of you know this, actually,
622.617	from when you go in to buy a television,
626.123	and in the shabbier end
626.123	of the row of flat-screen TVs,
629.049	you can see, are these
629.049	rather despised things
631.378	"called ""combined TV and DVD players."""
635.062	And we have no knowledge whatsoever
635.062	of the quality of those things,
638.277	but we look at a combined
638.277	"TV and DVD player and we go, ""Uck."
641.74	It's probably a bit of a crap telly
641.74	"and a bit rubbish as a DVD player."""
645.696	So we walk out of the shops
645.696	with one of each.
648.586	Google is as much a psychological success
648.586	as it is a technological one.
654.26	I propose that we can use
654.26	psychology to solve problems
656.917	that we didn't even realize
656.917	were problems at all.
659.272	This is my suggestion for getting people
659.272	to finish their course of antibiotics.
663.059	Don't give them 24 white pills;
664.652	give them 18 white pills and six blue ones
667.689	and tell them to take
667.689	the white pills first,
669.78	and then take the blue ones.
672.146	"It's called ""chunking."""
673.321	The likelihood that people will get
673.321	to the end is much greater
676.321	when there is a milestone
676.321	somewhere in the middle.
680.107	One of the great mistakes,
680.107	I think, of economics
682.477	is it fails to understand
682.477	that what something is --
684.904	whether it's retirement,
684.904	unemployment, cost --
688.676	is a function, not only of its amount,
688.676	but also its meaning.
693.231	This is a toll crossing in Britain.
696.057	Quite often queues happen at the tolls.
699.018	Sometimes you get very,
699.018	very severe queues.
701.266	You could apply
701.266	the same principle, actually,
703.48	to the security lanes in airports.
705.244	What would happen if you could actually
705.244	pay twice as much money
708.254	to cross the bridge,
709.429	but go through a lane
709.429	that's an express lane?
711.572	It's not an unreasonable thing to do;
713.366	it's an economically
713.366	efficient thing to do.
715.401	Time means more
715.401	to some people than others.
717.466	If you're waiting trying
717.466	to get to a job interview,
719.921	you'd patently pay a couple of pounds more
719.921	to go through the fast lane.
724.159	If you're on the way
724.159	to visit your mother-in-law,
726.512	you'd probably prefer --
727.687	(Laughter)
728.894	you'd probably prefer to stay on the left.
731.616	The only problem is if you introduce
731.616	this economically efficient solution,
735.117	people hate it ...
736.894	because they think you're deliberately
736.894	creating delays at the bridge
740.249	in order to maximize your revenue,
741.927	"and, ""Why on earth should I pay"
741.927	"to subsidize your incompetence?"""
745.636	On the other hand,
745.636	change the frame slightly
747.84	and create charitable yield management,
750.155	so the extra money you get
750.155	goes not to the bridge company,
753.313	it goes to charity ...
755.471	and the mental willingness
755.471	to pay completely changes.
759.388	You have a relatively
759.388	economically efficient solution,
762.055	but one that actually meets
762.055	with public approval
764.398	and even a small degree of affection,
766.422	rather than being seen as bastardy.
769.764	So where economists
769.764	make the fundamental mistake
772.442	is they think that money is money.
775.535	Actually, my pain experienced
775.535	in paying five pounds
779.79	is not just proportionate to the amount,
781.961	but where I think that money is going.
784.574	And I think understanding that
784.574	could revolutionize tax policy.
787.594	It could revolutionize
787.594	the public services.
789.621	It could actually change things
789.621	quite significantly.
792.158	[Ludwig Von Mises is my hero.]
793.644	Here's a guy you all need to study.
795.382	He's an Austrian School economist
797.011	who was first active in the first half
797.011	of the 20th century in Vienna.
801.599	What was interesting
801.599	about the Austrian School
803.815	is they actually grew up alongside Freud.
806.872	And so they're predominantly
806.872	interested in psychology.
809.549	They believed that there was
809.549	a discipline called praxeology,
814.126	which is a prior discipline
814.126	to the study of economics.
816.746	Praxeology is the study of human choice,
816.746	action and decision-making.
821.92	I think they're right.
823.269	I think the danger
823.269	we have in today's world
825.361	is we have the study of economics
827.065	considers itself to be a prior discipline
827.065	to the study of human psychology.
831.119	But as Charlie Munger says,
831.119	"""If economics isn't behavioral,"
834.112	"I don't know what the hell is."""
837.064	Von Mises, interestingly, believes
837.064	economics is just a subset of psychology.
842.889	I think he just refers to economics
844.818	"as ""the study of human praxeology"
844.818	"under conditions of scarcity."""
849.002	But Von Mises, among many other things,
852.122	I think uses an analogy which is probably
852.122	the best justification and explanation
856.796	for the value of marketing,
856.796	the value of perceived value
861.027	and the fact that we should treat it
861.027	as being absolutely equivalent
864.328	to any other kind of value.
866.314	We tend to, all of us, even those of us
866.314	who work in marketing,
869.29	think of value in two ways:
870.612	the real value, which is when
870.612	you make something in a factory
873.533	or provide a service,
874.711	and then there's a dubious value,
876.353	which you create by changing
876.353	the way people look at things.
879.188	Von Mises completely rejected
879.188	this distinction.
881.506	And he used this following analogy:
883.421	he referred to strange economists
883.421	called the French physiocrats,
888.778	who believed that the only true value
888.778	was what you extracted from the land.
892.432	So if you're a shepherd
892.432	or a quarryman or a farmer,
894.941	you created true value.
896.386	If however, you bought
896.386	some wool from the shepherd
899.269	and charged a premium
899.269	for converting it into a hat,
902.274	you weren't actually creating value,
904.08	you were exploiting the shepherd.
906.699	Now, Von Mises said that modern
906.699	economists make exactly the same mistake
910.446	with regard to advertising and marketing.
912.837	He says if you run a restaurant,
914.743	there is no healthy distinction to be made
917.006	between the value you create
917.006	by cooking the food
919.583	and the value you create
919.583	by sweeping the floor.
922.463	One of them creates, perhaps,
922.463	the primary product --
924.977	the thing we think we're paying for --
926.866	the other one creates a context
926.866	within which we can enjoy
929.731	and appreciate that product.
931.279	And the idea that one of them
931.279	should have priority over the other
934.475	is fundamentally wrong.
936.204	Try this quick thought experiment:
937.895	imagine a restaurant
937.895	that serves Michelin-starred food,
940.57	but where the restaurant smells of sewage
943.241	and there's human feces on the floor.
945.403	(Laughter)
946.836	The best thing you can do there
946.836	to create value
949.353	is not actually to improve
949.353	the food still further,
952.393	it's to get rid of the smell
952.393	and clean up the floor.
957.519	And it's vital we understand this.
960.096	If that seems like a sort
960.096	of strange, abstruse thing --
962.767	in the UK, the post office
962.767	had a 98 percent success rate
966.689	at delivering first-class
966.689	mail the next day.
969.452	They decided this wasn't good enough,
971.361	and they wanted to get it up to 99.
974.494	The effort to do that
974.494	almost broke the organization.
978.78	If, at the same time,
978.78	you'd gone and asked people,
981.194	"""What percentage of first-class mail"
981.194	"arrives the next day?"""
984.037	the average answer, or the modal answer,
984.037	"would have been ""50 to 60 percent."""
988.641	Now, if your perception
988.641	is much worse than your reality,
991.379	what on earth are you doing
991.379	trying to change the reality?
994.427	That's like trying to improve the food
994.427	in a restaurant that stinks.
999.622	What you need to do is,
999.622	first of all, tell people
1002.364	that 98 percent of first-class mail
1002.364	gets there the next day.
1006.895	That's pretty good.
1008.44	I would argue, in Britain,
1008.44	there's a much better frame of reference,
1011.672	which is to tell people that more
1011.672	first-class mail arrives the next day
1015.063	in the UK than in Germany,
1015.063	because generally, in Britain,
1017.802	if you want to make us happy
1017.802	about something,
1020.11	just tell us we do it
1020.11	better than the Germans.
1022.326	(Laughter)
1024.08	(Applause)
1026.356	Choose your frame of reference
1026.356	and the perceived value,
1029.601	and therefore, the actual value
1029.601	is completely transformed.
1033.031	It has to be said of the Germans
1034.7	that the Germans and the French
1034.7	are doing a brilliant job
1037.426	of creating a united Europe.
1038.904	The only thing they didn't expect
1038.904	is they're uniting Europe
1041.798	through a shared mild hatred
1041.798	of the French and Germans.
1044.82	But I'm British;
1044.82	that's the way we like it.
1046.894	(Laughter)
1049.359	What you'll also notice
1049.359	is that, in any case,
1051.504	our perception is leaky.
1052.718	We can't tell the difference
1052.718	between the quality of the food
1055.62	and the environment
1055.62	in which we consume it.
1057.657	All of you will have seen this phenomenon
1059.719	if you have your car washed or valeted.
1061.725	When you drive away,
1061.725	your car feels as if it drives better.
1064.87	(Laughter)
1066.235	And the reason for this --
1067.515	unless my car valet
1067.515	mysteriously is changing the oil
1070.187	and performing work which I'm not paying
1070.187	him for and I'm unaware of --
1073.554	is because perception
1073.554	is, in any case, leaky.
1075.885	Analgesics that are branded
1075.885	are more effective at reducing pain
1079.826	than analgesics that are not branded.
1081.661	I don't just mean through reported
1081.661	pain reduction --
1084.303	actual measured pain reduction.
1085.998	And so perception
1085.998	actually is leaky in any case.
1091.281	So if you do something
1091.281	that's perceptually bad in one respect,
1094.323	you can damage the other.
1095.57	Thank you very much.
1096.745	(Applause)
