15.26	My journey to become a polar specialist,
18.26	photographing, specializing
18.26	in the polar regions,
21.26	began when I was four years old,
23.26	when my family moved from southern Canada
26.26	to Northern Baffin Island,
26.26	up by Greenland.
29.26	There we lived with the Inuit
31.26	in the tiny Inuit community
31.26	of 200 Inuit people,
33.26	where [we] were one
33.26	of three non-Inuit families.
36.26	And in this community,
36.26	we didn't have a television;
38.26	we didn't have computers,
38.26	obviously, radio.
41.26	We didn't even have a telephone.
44.26	All of my time was spent outside
46.26	with the Inuit, playing.
48.26	The snow and the ice were my sandbox,
50.26	and the Inuit were my teachers.
52.26	And that's where I became
54.26	truly obsessed with this polar realm.
56.26	And I knew someday that
56.26	I was going to do something
58.26	that had to do with trying
58.26	to share news about it
60.26	and protect it.
62.26	I'd like to share with you,
62.26	for just two minutes only,
64.26	some images, a cross-section of my work,
66.26	to the beautiful music
66.26	"by Brandi Carlile, ""Have You Ever."""
69.26	I don't know why National Geographic
69.26	has done this, they've never done this before,
72.26	but they're allowing me
72.26	to show you a few images
74.26	from a coverage that I've just completed
74.26	that is not published yet.
77.26	National Geographic doesn't do this,
79.26	so I'm very excited to be able
79.26	to share this with you.
81.26	And what these images are --
83.26	you'll see them at the start of the slide show --
83.26	there's only about four images --
86.26	but it's of a little bear
86.26	that lives in the Great Bear Rainforest.
89.26	It's pure white,
89.26	but it's not a polar bear.
92.26	It's a spirit bear,
92.26	or a Kermode bear.
94.26	There are only 200 of these bears left.
96.26	They're more rare than the panda bear.
99.26	I sat there on the river
99.26	for two months without seeing one.
102.26	I thought, my career's over.
104.26	I proposed this stupid story
104.26	to National Geographic.
106.26	What in the heck was I thinking?
108.26	So I had two months to sit there
110.26	and figure out different ways
110.26	of what I was going to do in my next life,
112.26	after I was a photographer,
112.26	because they were going to fire me.
114.26	Because National Geographic is a magazine;
114.26	they remind us all the time:
117.26	they publish pictures, not excuses.
119.26	(Laughter)
124.26	And after two months of sitting there --
126.26	one day, thinking that it was all over,
128.26	this incredible big white male came down,
130.26	right beside me, three feet away from me,
132.26	and he went down and grabbed a fish
132.26	and went off in the forest and ate it.
135.26	And then I spent the entire day
135.26	living my childhood dream
138.26	of walking around with this bear
138.26	through the forest.
141.26	He went through this old-growth forest
143.26	and sat up beside this 400-year-old
143.26	culturally modified tree and went to sleep.
146.26	And I actually got to sleep
146.26	within three feet of him,
149.26	just in the forest, and photograph him.
152.26	So I'm very excited to be able
152.26	to show you those images
155.26	and a cross-section of my work
155.26	that I've done on the polar regions.
157.26	Please enjoy.

308.26	Paul Nicklen: Thank you very much.
308.26	The show's not over.
311.26	My clock is ticking. OK, let's stop.
313.26	Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
315.26	We're inundated with news all the time
318.26	that the sea ice is disappearing
320.26	and it's at its lowest level.
322.26	And in fact, scientists
322.26	were originally saying
324.26	sea ice is going to disappear
324.26	in the next hundred years, then they said 50 years.
327.26	Now they're saying
327.26	the sea ice in the Arctic,
330.26	the summertime extent is going to be gone
330.26	in the next four to 10 years.
333.26	And what does that mean?
335.26	After a while of reading this in the news,
335.26	it just becomes news.
338.26	You glaze over with it.
340.26	And what I'm trying to do
340.26	with my work is put faces to this.
342.26	And I want people to understand
342.26	and get the concept
345.26	that, if we lose ice,
347.26	we stand to lose an entire ecosystem.
349.26	Projections are that we could
349.26	lose polar bears, they could become extinct
352.26	in the next 50 to 100 years.
354.26	And there's no better, sexier,
356.26	more beautiful,
356.26	charismatic megafauna species
359.26	for me to hang my campaign on.
362.26	Polar bears are amazing hunters.
364.26	This was a bear I sat with
364.26	for a while on the shores.
366.26	There was no ice around.
368.26	But this glacier caved into the water
368.26	and a seal got on it.
370.26	And this bear swam out to that seal --
374.26	grabbed it, swam back and ate it.
377.26	And he was so full,
377.26	he was so happy and so fat eating this seal,
380.26	that, as I approached him --
382.26	about 20 feet away --
382.26	to get this picture,
384.26	his only defense was to keep eating more seal.
386.26	And as he ate, he was so full --
388.26	he probably had about
391.26	and as he ate inside
391.26	one side of his mouth,
393.26	he was regurgitating
393.26	out the other side of his mouth.
396.26	So as long as these bears
396.26	have any bit of ice they will survive,
399.26	but it's the ice that's disappearing.
402.26	We're finding more and more
402.26	dead bears in the Arctic.
405.26	When I worked on polar bears
405.26	as a biologist 20 years ago,
407.26	we never found dead bears.
409.26	And in the last four or five years,
411.26	we're finding dead bears
411.26	popping up all over the place.
413.26	We're seeing them in the Beaufort Sea,
415.26	floating in the open ocean
415.26	where the ice has melted out.
417.26	I found a couple in Norway last year.
417.26	We're seeing them on the ice.
420.26	These bears are already showing signs
422.26	of the stress of disappearing ice.
425.26	Here's a mother and her two year-old cub
428.26	were traveling on a ship a hundred miles
428.26	offshore in the middle of nowhere,
431.26	and they're riding
431.26	on this big piece of glacier ice,
433.26	which is great for them;
433.26	they're safe at this point.
435.26	They're not going to die of hypothermia.
437.26	They're going to get to land.
439.26	But unfortunately,
441.26	are also receding right now
443.26	to the point that the ice
443.26	is ending up on land
445.26	and not injecting any ice
445.26	back into the ecosystem.
449.26	These ringed seals,
449.26	"these are the ""fatsicles"" of the Arctic."
451.26	These little, fat dumplings,
456.26	are the mainstay of the polar bear.
458.26	And they're not like
458.26	the harbor seals that you have here.
461.26	These ringed seals also
461.26	live out their entire life cycle
464.26	associated and connected to sea ice.
467.26	They give birth inside the ice,
469.26	and they feed on the Arctic cod
469.26	that live under the ice.
472.26	And here's a picture of sick ice.
474.26	This is a piece of multi-year ice
474.26	that's 12 years old.
477.26	And what scientists didn't predict
477.26	is that, as this ice melts,
480.26	these big pockets
480.26	of black water are forming
483.26	and they're grabbing the sun's energy
485.26	and accelerating the melting process.
487.26	And here we are diving
487.26	in the Beaufort Sea.
489.26	The visibility's 600 ft.;
489.26	we're on our safety lines;
492.26	the ice is moving all over the place.
494.26	I wish I could spend half
494.26	an hour telling you
496.26	about how we almost died on this dive.
498.26	But what's important in this picture
498.26	is that you have a piece of multi-year ice,
501.26	that big chunk of ice up in the corner.
503.26	In that one single piece of ice,
505.26	you have 300 species of microorganisms.
507.26	And in the spring,
507.26	when the sun returns to the ice,
510.26	it forms the phytoplankton,
510.26	grows under that ice,
512.26	and then you get bigger sheets of seaweed,
515.26	and then you get the
515.26	zooplankton feeding on all that life.
517.26	So really what the ice does
519.26	is it acts like a garden.
521.26	It acts like the soil in a garden.
521.26	It's an inverted garden.
524.26	Losing that ice is like
524.26	losing the soil in a garden.
526.26	Here's me in my office.
528.26	I hope you appreciate yours.
530.26	This is after an hour under the ice.
533.26	I can't feel my lips; my face is frozen;
535.26	I can't feel my hands;
535.26	I can't feel my feet.
537.26	And I've come up, and all I wanted
537.26	to do was get out of the water.
540.26	After an hour in these conditions,
542.26	it's so extreme that, when I go down,
544.26	almost every dive I vomit into my regulator
546.26	because my body can't deal
546.26	with the stress of the cold on my head.
549.26	And so I'm just so happy
549.26	that the dive is over.
551.26	I get to hand my camera to my assistant,
553.26	and I'm looking up at him,
553.26	"and I'm going, ""Woo. Woo. Woo."""
556.26	"Which means, ""Take my camera."""
558.26	And he thinks I'm saying,
558.26	"""Take my picture."""
560.26	So we had this little
560.26	communication breakdown.
563.26	(Laughter)
566.26	But it's worth it.
568.26	I'm going to show you pictures
568.26	of beluga whales, bowhead whales,
570.26	and narwhals, and polar bears,
570.26	and leopard seals today,
573.26	but this picture right here means more
573.26	to me than any other I've ever made.
576.26	I dropped down in this ice hole,
576.26	just through that hole that you just saw,
579.26	and I looked up under
579.26	the underside of the ice,
581.26	and I was dizzy;
581.26	I thought I had vertigo.
583.26	I got very nervous --
583.26	no rope, no safety line,
585.26	the whole world is moving around me --
587.26	"and I thought, ""I'm in trouble."""
589.26	But what happened
589.26	is that the entire underside
591.26	was full of these billions
591.26	of amphipods and copepods
594.26	moving around and feeding
594.26	on the underside of the ice,
597.26	giving birth and living out
597.26	their entire life cycle.
599.26	This is the foundation of the whole food chain
599.26	in the Arctic, right here.
602.26	And when you have low 
602.26	productivity in this, in ice,
605.26	the productivity in copepods go down.
608.26	This is a bowhead whale.
610.26	Supposedly, science is stating
612.26	that it could be the oldest living animal
612.26	on earth right now.
615.26	This very whale right here
615.26	could be over 250 years old.
618.26	This whale could have been born
620.26	around the start
620.26	of the Industrial Revolution.
622.26	It could have survived
625.26	And now its biggest threat
625.26	is the disappearance of ice in the North
628.26	because of the lives
628.26	that we're leading in the South.
631.26	Narwhals, these majestic narwhals
633.26	with their eight-foot long ivory tusks,
633.26	don't have to be here;
636.26	they could be out on the open water.
638.26	But they're forcing themselves
638.26	to come up in these tiny little ice holes
641.26	where they can breathe, catch a breath,
643.26	because right under that ice
643.26	are all the swarms of cod.
646.26	And the cod are there
648.26	because they are feeding
648.26	on all the copepods and amphipods.
651.26	Alright, my favorite part.
654.26	When I'm on my deathbed,
656.26	I'm going to remember
656.26	one story more than any other.
658.26	Even though that spirit bear
658.26	moment was powerful,
661.26	I don't think I'll ever have
661.26	another experience
663.26	like I did with these leopard seals.
665.26	Leopard seals, since the time of Shackleton,
665.26	have had a bad reputation.
668.26	They've got that wryly smile
668.26	on their mouth.
670.26	They've got those black sinister eyes
672.26	and those spots on their body.
674.26	They look positively prehistoric
674.26	and a bit scary.
677.26	And tragically in [2003],
679.26	a scientist was taken down
679.26	and drowned,
682.26	and she was being consumed
682.26	by a leopard seal.
684.26	"And people were like, ""We knew"
684.26	"they were vicious. We knew they were."""
687.26	And so people love to form their opinions.
689.26	And that's when I got a story idea:
691.26	I want to go to Antarctica,
693.26	get in the water with as many
693.26	leopard seals as I possibly can
695.26	and give them a fair shake --
697.26	find out if they really are these vicious
697.26	animals, or if they're misunderstood.
700.26	So this is that story.
702.26	Oh, and they also happen
702.26	to eat Happy Feet.
705.26	(Laughter)
708.26	As a species, as humans,
708.26	we like to say penguins are really cute,
711.26	therefore, leopard seals eat them,
711.26	so leopard seals are ugly and bad.
714.26	It doesn't work that way.
716.26	The penguin doesn't know it's cute,
718.26	and the leopard seal doesn't
718.26	know it's kind of big and monstrous.
720.26	This is just the food chain unfolding.
723.26	They're also big.
725.26	They're not these little harbor seals.
727.26	They are 12 ft. long, a thousand pounds.
729.26	And they're also curiously aggressive.
732.26	You get 12 tourists packed into a Zodiac,
735.26	floating in these icy waters,
737.26	and a leopard seal comes up
737.26	and bites the pontoon.
739.26	The boat starts to sink, they race back to the ship
742.26	and get to go home and tell
742.26	the stories of how they got attacked.
744.26	All the leopard seal was doing --
746.26	it's just biting a balloon.
748.26	It just sees this big balloon in the ocean --
748.26	it doesn't have hands --
750.26	it's going to take a little bite,
750.26	the boat pops, and off they go.
753.26	(Laughter)
755.26	So after five days of crossing
755.26	the Drake Passage --
758.26	isn't that beautiful --
761.26	after five days of crossing
761.26	the Drake Passage,
764.26	we have finally arrived at Antarctica.
766.26	I'm with my Swedish assistant and guide.
768.26	His name is Goran Ehlme
768.26	from Sweden -- Goran.
772.26	And he has a lot of experience
772.26	with leopard seals. I have never seen one.
775.26	So we come around the cove
775.26	in our little Zodiac boat,
778.26	and there's this monstrous leopard seal.
780.26	And even in his voice, he goes,
780.26	"""That's a bloody big seal, ya."""
782.26	(Laughter)
784.26	And this seal is taking
784.26	this penguin by the head,
787.26	and it's flipping it back and forth.
789.26	And what it's trying to do
789.26	is turn that penguin inside-out,
791.26	so it can eat the meat off the bones,
794.26	and then it goes off and gets another one.
796.26	And so this leopard seal
796.26	grabbed another penguin,
798.26	came under the boat, the Zodiac,
800.26	starting hitting the hull of the boat.
802.26	And we're trying to not fall in the water.
804.26	And we sit down,
804.26	and that's when Goran said to me,
807.26	"""This is a good seal, ya."
809.26	"It's time for you to get in the water."""
811.26	(Laughter)
814.26	And I looked at Goran,
814.26	"and I said to him, ""Forget that."""
817.26	But I think I probably used a different word
817.26	"starting with the letter ""F."""
821.26	But he was right.
823.26	He scolded me out,
823.26	"and said, ""This is why we're here."
825.26	And you purposed this stupid story
825.26	to National Geographic.
827.26	And now you've got to deliver.
829.26	"And you can't publish excuses."""
831.26	So I had such dry mouth --
833.26	probably not as bad as now --
835.26	but I had such, such dry mouth.
839.26	And my legs were just trembling.
839.26	I couldn't feel my legs.
842.26	I put my flippers on.
842.26	I could barely part my lips.
844.26	I put my snorkel in my mouth,
846.26	and I rolled over the side
846.26	of the Zodiac into the water.
849.26	And this was the first thing she did.
851.26	She came racing up to me,
851.26	engulfed my whole camera --
854.26	and her teeth are up here
854.26	and down here --
857.26	but Goran, before I had gotten in the water,
857.26	had given me amazing advice.
860.26	"He said, ""If you get scared,"
860.26	"you close your eyes, ya, and she'll go away."""
864.26	(Laughter)
867.26	So that's all I had to work
867.26	with at that point.
869.26	But I just started to shoot these pictures.
871.26	So she did this threat display
871.26	for a few minutes,
873.26	and then the most amazing thing happened --
873.26	she totally relaxed.
876.26	She went off, she got a penguin.
878.26	She stopped about 10 feet away from me,
880.26	and she sat there with this penguin,
880.26	the penguin's flapping, and she let's it go.
883.26	The penguin swims toward me, takes off.
886.26	She grabs another one.
886.26	She does this over and over.
888.26	And it dawned on me
888.26	that she's trying to feed me a penguin.
890.26	Why else would she release
890.26	these penguins at me?
894.26	And after she did this four or five times,
897.26	she swam by me
897.26	with this dejected look on her face.
900.26	You don't want to be too anthropomorphic,
900.26	but I swear that she looked at me
903.26	"like, ""This useless predator's"
903.26	"going to starve in my ocean."""
905.26	(Laughter)
910.26	So realizing I couldn't catch
910.26	swimming penguins,
912.26	she'd get these other penguins
912.26	and bring them slowly towards me,
914.26	bobbing like this,
914.26	and she'd let them go.
916.26	This didn't work.
918.26	I was laughing so hard and so emotional
920.26	that my mask was flooding,
920.26	because I was crying underwater,
922.26	just because it was so amazing.
924.26	And so that didn't work.
926.26	So then she'd get another penguin
926.26	and try this ballet-like sexy display
928.26	sliding down this iceberg like this. (Laughter)
931.26	And she would sort of bring them
931.26	over to me and offer it to me.
933.26	This went on for four days.
935.26	This just didn't happen a couple of times.
937.26	And then so she realized
937.26	I couldn't catch live ones,
939.26	so she brought me dead penguins.
941.26	(Laughter)
944.26	Now I've got four or five penguins
944.26	floating around my head,
948.26	and I'm just sitting there shooting away.
952.26	And she would often stop
952.26	and have this dejected look on her face
954.26	"like, ""Are you for real?"""
956.26	Because she can't believe
956.26	I can't eat this penguin.
958.26	Because in her world,
958.26	you're either breeding or you're eating --
960.26	and I'm not breeding, so ...
962.26	(Laughter)
964.26	And then that wasn't enough;
964.26	she started to flip penguins onto my head.
967.26	She was trying to force-feed me.
967.26	She's pushing me around.
969.26	She's trying to force-feed my camera,
971.26	which is every photographer's dream.
974.26	And she would get frustrated;
974.26	she'd blow bubbles in my face.
977.26	She would, I think, let me know
977.26	that I was going to starve.
979.26	But yet she didn't stop.
981.26	She would not stop
981.26	trying to feed me penguins.
983.26	And on the last day with this female
985.26	where I thought I had pushed her too far,
987.26	I got nervous because she came up to me,
990.26	she rolled over on her back,
992.26	and she did this deep, guttural
992.26	jackhammer sound, this gok-gok-gok-gok.
995.26	And I thought, she's about to bite.
997.26	She's about to let me know
997.26	she's too frustrated with me.
1000.26	What had happened
1000.26	was another seal had snuck in behind me,
1003.26	and she did that to threat display.
1005.26	She chased that big seal away,
1005.26	went and got its penguin
1007.26	and brought it to me.
1009.26	(Laughter)
1012.26	That wasn't the only seal
1012.26	I got in the water with.
1014.26	I got in the water
1014.26	with 30 other leopard seals,
1017.26	and I never once had a scary encounter.
1020.26	They are the most remarkable animals
1020.26	I've ever worked with,
1022.26	and the same with polar bears.
1024.26	And just like the polar bears,
1026.26	these animals depend
1026.26	on an icy environment.
1031.26	I get emotional. Sorry.
1034.26	It's a story that lives deep in my heart,
1037.26	and I'm proud to share this with you.
1039.26	And I'm so passionate about it.
1041.26	Anybody want to come with me
1041.26	to Antarctica or the Arctic, I'll take you; let's go.
1044.26	We've got to get the story out now.
1044.26	Thank you very much.
1046.26	(Applause)
1048.26	Thank you.
1050.26	(Applause)
1054.26	Thank you.
1056.26	(Applause)
1062.26	Thank you. Thanks very much.
1064.26	(Applause)
1066.26	Thank you.
1068.26	(Applause)
