31	Thank you.
35	And I feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me.
39	I feel it's sort of like the Vimalakirti Sutra,
43	an ancient work from ancient India
46	in which the Buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people
52	come to see him from the biggest city in the area, Vaishali,
56	and they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him.
60	All the young people, actually, from the city.
63	The old fogeys don't come because they're mad at Buddha,
68	because when he came to their city he accepted --
70	he always accepts the first invitation that comes to him, from whoever it is,
74	and the local geisha, a movie-star sort of person,
78	raced the elders of the city in a chariot and invited him first.
81	So he was hanging out with the movie star, and of course they were grumbling:
85	"""He's supposed to be religious and all this."
87	"What's he doing over there at Amrapali's house with all his 500 monks,"""
92	and so on. They were all grumbling, and so they boycotted him.
96	They wouldn't go listen to him.
97	But the young people all came.
99	And they brought this kind of a jeweled parasol, and they put it on the ground.
103	And as soon as they had laid all these,
105	all their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient India,
110	he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium,
117	the wonder of the universe. Everyone looked in that, and they saw in there
120	the total interconnectedness of all life in all universes.
124	And of course, in the Buddhist cosmos there are millions and billions of planets
128	with human life on it,
130	and enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets.
133	So they don't -- when they look out and they see those lights that you showed
136	in the sky -- they don't just see sort of pieces of matter burning
140	or rocks or flames or gases exploding.
144	They actually see landscapes and human beings
146	and gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that.
152	He made that special effect at the beginning
154	to get everyone to think about interconnection
157	and interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected.
162	And then Leilei -- I know his other name -- told us about interconnection,
170	and how we're all totally interconnected here,
173	and how we've all known each other. And of course in the Buddhist universe,
176	we've already done this already billions of times in many, many lifetimes in the past.
181	And I didn't give the talk always. You did, and we had to watch you, and so forth.
190	And we're all still trying to, I guess we're all trying to become TEDsters,
194	if that's a modern form of enlightenment.
198	I guess so. Because in a way, if a TEDster relates to all the interconnectedness
202	of all the computers and everything, it's the forging of a mass awareness,
208	of where everybody can really know everything
210	that's going on everywhere in the planet.
212	And therefore it will become intolerable --
214	what compassion is, is where it will become intolerable for us,
218	totally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying
224	the life of the mind or whatever it is,
226	and there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease
231	and they cannot have a bite of food and they have no place,
234	or they're being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth.
237	It just becomes intolerable.
239	With all of us knowing everything, we're kind of forced by technology
245	to become Buddhas or something, to become enlightened.
249	And of course, we all will be deeply disappointed when we do.
255	Because we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do,
262	a little bit tired, we do suffer.
264	We do enjoy our misery in a certain way.
267	We distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere,
270	but basically we all have this common misery
272	that we are sort of stuck inside our skins
275	and everyone else is out there.
278	And occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin
281	and the two of us enjoy each other, and each one tries to get out of their own,
286	and ultimately it fails of course, and then we're back into this thing.
290	Because our egocentric perception -- from the Buddha's point of view, misperception --
296	is that all we are is what is inside our skin.
300	And it's inside and outside, self and other,
303	and other is all very different.
304	And everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception,
307	a little bit, right?
310	You know, someone sitting next to you in a seat -- that's OK because you're in a theater,
313	but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you,
316	you'd freak out.
318	What do they want from me? Like, who's that?
321	And so you wouldn't sit that close to another person
324	because of your notion that it's you versus the universe -- that's all Buddha discovered.
330	Because that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone, each of us,
335	and everyone else is different,
338	then that puts us in an impossible situation, doesn't it?
341	Who is it who's going to get enough attention from the world?
344	Who's going to get enough out of the world?
347	Who's not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings --
350	if you're different from all the other beings?
353	So where compassion comes is where you
357	surprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way:
362	through art, through meditation, through understanding, through knowledge actually,
367	knowing that you have no such boundary,
369	knowing your interconnectedness with other beings.
372	You can experience yourself as the other beings
375	when you see through the delusion of being separated from them.
380	When you do that, you're forced to feel what they feel.
383	Luckily, they say -- I still am not sure --
387	but luckily, they say that when you reach that point because some people have said
391	"in the Buddhist literature, they say, ""Oh who would really want to be compassionate?"
394	How awful! I'm so miserable on my own. My head is aching.
399	My bones are aching. I go from birth to death. I'm never satisfied.
402	I never have enough, even if I'm a billionaire, I don't have enough.
405	"I need a hundred billion."" So I'm like that."
408	Imagine if I had to feel even a hundred other people's suffering.
414	It would be terrible.
416	But apparently, this is a strange paradox of life.
419	When you're no longer locked in yourself,
423	and as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge
426	of the nature of the world, that enables you to let your mind spread out,
434	and empathize, and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing,
438	and realizing that you are the other being,
441	somehow by that opening, you can see the deeper nature of life. And you can,
447	you get away from this terrible iron circle of I, me, me, mine,
455	like the Beatles used to sing.
457	You know, we really learned everything in the '60s.
459	Too bad nobody ever woke up to it,
463	and they've been trying to suppress it since then.
465	I, me, me, mine. It's like a perfect song, that song. A perfect teaching.
470	But when we're relieved from that,
473	we somehow then become interested in all the other beings.
475	And we feel ourselves differently. It's totally strange.
479	It's totally strange.
481	The Dalai Lama always likes to say --
484	he says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion,
489	it's because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures
493	are finally too small a theater for your intelligence.
497	It's really too boring whether you feel like this or like that, or what, you know --
502	and the more you focus on how you feel, by the way, the worse it gets.
508	Like, even when you're having a good time,
510	when is the good time over?
512	The good time is over when you think, how good is it?
516	And then it's never good enough.
519	I love that Leilei said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly
524	on the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time,
529	doing it by having a good time.
531	I think the Dalai Lama should have heard that. I wish he'd been there to hear that.
534	He once told me -- he looked kind of sad;
536	he worries very much about the haves and have-nots.
538	He looked a little sad, because he said, well, a hundred years ago,
542	they went and took everything away from the haves.
545	You know, the big communist revolutions, Russia and China and so forth.
548	They took it all away by violence,
550	saying they were going to give it to everyone, and then they were even worse.
554	They didn't help at all.
556	So what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today?
562	And so then he looks at me.
564	"So I said, ""Well, you know, you're all in this yourself. You teach: it's generosity,"""
569	was all I could think of. What is virtue?
572	But of course, what you said, I think the key to saving the world, the key to compassion
578	is that it is more fun.
582	It should be done by fun. Generosity is more fun. That's the key.
587	Everybody has the wrong idea. They think Buddha was so boring,
591	and they're so surprised when they meet Dalai Lama and he's fairly jolly.
595	Even though his people are being genocided --
597	and believe me, he feels every blow on every old nun's head,
602	in every Chinese prison. He feels it.
605	He feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays.
608	I won't even say what they do. But he feels it.
612	And yet he's very jolly. He's extremely jolly.
616	Because when you open up like that,
619	then you can't just -- what good does it do to add being miserable with others' misery?
625	You have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is,
628	how it can be changed.
630	Look at that beautiful thing Chiho showed us. She scared us with the lava man.
634	She scared us with the lava man is coming,
637	then the tsunami is coming,
639	but then finally there were flowers and trees, and it was very beautiful.
645	It's really lovely.
647	So, compassion means to feel the feelings of others,
653	and the human being actually is compassion.
656	The human being is almost out of time.
660	The human being is compassion because what is our brain for?
664	Now, Jim's brain is memorizing the almanac.
670	But he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is, he will, he did.
675	He could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings.
680	And he would have tremendous fun doing that.
683	So the first person who gets happy,
685	when you stop focusing on the self-centered situation of, how happy am I,
690	where you're always dissatisfied --
692	as Mick Jagger told us. You never get any satisfaction that way.
697	"So then you decide, ""Well, I'm sick of myself."
699	I'm going to think of how other people can be happy.
702	I'm going to get up in the morning and think,
703	what can I do for even one other person, even a dog, my dog, my cat,
707	"my pet, my butterfly?"""
710	And the first person who gets happy when you do that,
712	you don't do anything for anybody else, but you get happier, you yourself,
717	because your whole perception broadens
720	and you suddenly see the whole world and all of the people in it.
724	And you realize that this -- being with these people --
726	is the flower garden that Chiho showed us.
728	It is Nirvana.
730	And my time is up. And I know the TED commandments.
732	Thank you.
