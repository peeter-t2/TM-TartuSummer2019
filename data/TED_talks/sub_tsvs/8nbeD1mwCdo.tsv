12.88	When was I was 21 years old,
15.04	I had all this physics homework.
17.8	Physics homework requires taking breaks,
20.16	and Wikipedia was relatively new,
20.16	so I took a lot of breaks there.
24.24	I kept going back to the same articles,
26.48	reading them again and again,
28.16	on glaciers, Antarctica and Greenland.
33.32	How cool would it be to visit these places
35.88	and what would it take to do so?
38.28	Well, here we are
39.52	on a repurposed Air Force cargo plane
41.96	operated by NASA
43.64	flying over the Greenland ice sheet.
46.4	There's a lot to see here,
48.04	but there's more that is hidden,
49.84	waiting to be uncovered.
52.36	What the Wikipedia articles didn't tell me
54.68	is that there's liquid water
54.68	hidden inside the ice sheet,
58.68	because we didn't know that yet.
62	I did learn on Wikipedia
62	that the Greenland ice sheet is huge,
65.6	the size of Mexico,
66.92	and its ice from top to bottom
66.92	is two miles thick.
70.72	But it's not just static.
72.6	The ice flows like a river
72.6	downhill towards the ocean.
77.08	As it flows around bends,
79	it deforms and cracks.
81.6	I get to study these amazing ice dynamics,
84.32	which are located in one of the most
84.32	remote physical environments
87.44	remaining on earth.
89.56	To work in glaciology right now
89.56	is like getting in on the ground floor
93.04	at Facebook in the 2000s.
95.52	(Laughter)
97.12	Our capability to fly airplanes
97.12	and satellites over the ice sheets
100.28	is revolutionizing glaciology.
102.52	It's just starting to do for science
104.48	what the smartphone
104.48	has done for social media.
107.32	The satellites are reporting
107.32	a wealth of observations
110.32	that are revealing new hidden facts
110.32	about the ice sheets continuously.
115.4	For instance, we have observations
115.4	of the size of the Greenland ice sheet
119.16	every month going back to 2002.
122.32	You can look towards the bottom
122.32	of the screen here
124.72	to see the month and the year go forward.
126.72	You can see that some areas
126.72	of the ice sheet melt
129.24	or lose ice in the summer.
131.64	Other areas experience snowfall
133.72	or gain ice back in the winter.
136.84	This seasonal cycle, though, is eclipsed
136.84	by an overall rate of mass loss
141.72	that would have stunned
141.72	a glaciologist 50 years ago.
145.04	We never thought that an ice sheet could
145.04	lose mass into the ocean this quickly.
151.32	Since these measurements began in 2002,
153.92	the ice sheet has lost so much ice
156.08	that if that water were piled up
156.08	on our smallest continent,
159.72	it would drown Australia knee-deep.
162.84	How is this possible?
165.4	Well, under the ice lies the bedrock.
168.64	We used radar to image the hills,
168.64	valleys, mountains and depressions
173.12	that the ice flows over.
174.96	Hidden under the ice sheet are channels
174.96	the size of the Grand Canyon
178.48	that funnel ice and water
178.48	off of Greenland and into the ocean.
184.32	The reason that radar
184.32	can reveal the bedrock
186.88	is that ice is entirely
186.88	transparent to radar.
189.76	You can do an experiment.
191.32	Go home and put
191.32	an ice cube in the microwave.
194.92	It won't melt,
196.72	because microwaves, or radar,
198.84	pass straight through the ice
198.84	without interacting.
202.76	If you want to melt your ice cube,
202.76	you have to get it wet,
205.52	because water heats up easily
205.52	in the microwave.
209.24	That's the whole principle
209.24	the microwave oven is designed around.
212.6	Radar can see water.
215.12	And radar has revealed
215.12	a vast pool of liquid water
218.84	hidden under my colleague Olivia,
220.8	seven stories beneath her feet.
223.32	Here, she's used a pump
224.6	to bring some of that water
224.6	back to the ice sheet's surface.
227.84	Just six years ago, we had no idea
227.84	this glacier aquifer existed.
233.84	The aquifer formed
235.16	when snow melts in the summer sun
237.56	and trickles downward.
239.68	It puddles up in huge pools.
242.6	From there, the snow acts as an igloo,
245.16	insulating this water
245.16	from the cold and the wind above.
249.12	So the water can stay
249.12	hidden in the ice sheet
251.64	in liquid form year after year.
254.88	The question is, what happens next?
257.72	Does the water stay there forever?
259.48	It could.
260.72	Or does it find a way out
260.72	to reach the global ocean?
264.4	One possible way
264.4	for the water to reach the bedrock
267.8	and from there the ocean
269.48	is a crevasse, or a crack in the ice.
272.68	When cracks fill with water,
274.2	the weight of the water
274.2	forces them deeper and deeper.
277.6	This is how fracking works
279.04	to extract natural gas
279.04	from deep within the earth.
282.08	Pressurized fluids fracture rocks.
284.76	All it takes is a crack to get started.
287.92	Well, we recently discovered
290.2	that there are cracks available
290.2	in the Greenland ice sheet
294.12	near this glacier aquifer.
296.44	You can fly over
296.44	most of the Greenland ice sheet
298.72	and see nothing,
299.96	no cracks, no features on the surface,
302.88	but as this helicopter
302.88	flies towards the coast,
306.08	the path that water would take
306.08	on its quest to flow downhill,
309.72	one crack appears,
311.32	then another and another.
314.84	Are these cracks filled with liquid water?
317.44	And if so, how deep
317.44	do they take that water?
320.12	Can they take it to the bedrock
321.64	and the ocean?
323	To answer these questions,
324.72	we need something
324.72	beyond remote sensing data.
328.16	We need numeric models.
331.16	I write numeric models
331.16	that run on supercomputers.
334.36	A numeric model
334.36	is simply a set of equations
336.8	that works together to describe something.
339.6	It can be as simple
339.6	as the next number in a sequence --
342.52	one, three, five, seven --
345.32	or it can be a more complex
345.32	set of equations
347.72	that predict the future
349.12	based on known conditions in the present.
351.68	In our case, what are
351.68	the equations for how ice cracks?
356.24	Well, engineers already have
356.24	a very good understanding
359.84	of how aluminum, steel and plastics
359.84	fracture under stress.
364.24	It's an important problem in our society.
367.8	And it turns out
367.8	that the engineering equations
370.04	for how materials fracture
371.64	are not that different
371.64	from my physics homework.
374.4	So I borrowed them, adapted them for ice,
377.28	and then I had a numeric model
377.28	for how a crevasse can fracture
380.76	when filled with water from the aquifer.
384	This is the power of math.
385.76	It can help us understand
385.76	real processes in our world.
389.88	I'll show you now
389.88	the results of my numeric model,
392.6	but first I should point out
394.2	that the crevasse is about
394.2	a thousand times narrower than it is deep,
398.04	so in the main panel here,
399.56	we've zoomed in to better see the details.
401.68	You can look to the smaller
401.68	panel on the right
403.88	to see the true scale
403.88	for how tall and skinny the crevasse is.
408.44	As the aquifer water
408.44	flows into the crevasse,
411.04	some of it refreezes
411.04	in the negative 15 degree Celsius ice.
415.04	That's about as cold
415.04	as your kitchen freezer.
417.56	But this loss can be overcome
419.56	if the flow rate in from
419.56	the glacier aquifer is high enough.
423.44	In our case, it is,
425.04	and the aquifer water drives the crevasse
425.04	all the way to the base of the ice sheet
429.68	a thousand meters below.
432.8	From there, it has a clear path
432.8	to reach the ocean.
436.48	So the aquifer water is a part
438.84	of the three millimeters
438.84	per year of sea level rise
442.16	that we experience as a global society.
446.52	But there's more:
447.8	the aquifer water
447.8	might be punching above its weight.
451.56	The ice flows in complex ways.
455.04	In some places, the ice flows very fast.
457.96	There tends to be water
457.96	at the base of the ice sheet here.
461.4	In other places, not so fast.
463.04	Usually, there's not water
463.04	present at the base there.
466.6	Now that we know the aquifer water
466.6	is getting to the base of the ice sheet,
470.4	the next question is:
472.16	Is it making the ice itself
472.16	flow faster into the ocean?
478.08	We're trying to uncover these mysteries
478.08	hidden inside the Greenland ice sheet
481.84	so that we can better plan
481.84	for the sea level rise it holds.
486.12	The amount of ice
486.12	that Greenland has lost since 2002
489.48	is just a small fraction
489.48	of what that ice sheet holds.
494.12	Ice sheets are immense, powerful machines
494.12	that operate on long timescales.
499	In the next 80 years, global sea levels
499	will rise at least 20 centimeters,
504.6	perhaps as much as one meter,
506.8	and maybe more.
508.6	Our understanding
508.6	of future sea level rise is good,
511.76	but our projections have a wide range.
514.16	It's our role as glaciologists
514.16	and scientists
517.36	to narrow these uncertainties.
520.2	How much sea level rise is coming,
523.04	and how fast will it get here?
526.4	We need to know how much and how fast,
530	so the world and its communities can
530	plan for the sea level rise that's coming.
535.039	Thank you.
536.509	(Applause)
