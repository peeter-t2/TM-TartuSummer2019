16.307	Imagine a big explosion
16.307	as you climb through 3,000 ft.
22.085	Imagine a plane full of smoke.
25.622	Imagine an engine
25.622	going clack, clack, clack.
29.603	It sounds scary.
31.482	Well, I had a unique seat that day.
33.367	I was sitting in 1D.
35.11	I was the only one who could talk
35.11	to the flight attendants.
38.296	So I looked at them right away,
40.017	"and they said, ""No problem."
40.017	"We probably hit some birds."""
43.019	The pilot had already
43.019	turned the plane around,
45.215	and we weren't that far.
46.509	You could see Manhattan.
49.379	Two minutes later,
50.61	three things happened at the same time.
54.156	The pilot lines up the plane
54.156	with the Hudson River.
58.453	That's usually not the route.
60.21	(Laughter)
61.922	He turns off the engines.
64.662	Now, imagine being
64.662	in a plane with no sound.
67.981	And then he says three words.
70.158	The most unemotional
70.158	three words I've ever heard.
73.015	"He says, ""Brace for impact."""
76.473	I didn't have to talk
76.473	to the flight attendant anymore.
79.114	(Laughter)
81.801	I could see in her eyes, it was terror.
84.412	Life was over.
86.26	Now I want to share with you three things
86.26	I learned about myself that day.
91.45	I learned that it
91.45	all changes in an instant.
94.942	We have this bucket list,
96.688	we have these things
96.688	we want to do in life,
99.055	and I thought about all the people
99.055	I wanted to reach out to that I didn't,
102.596	all the fences I wanted to mend,
104.752	all the experiences I wanted
104.752	to have and I never did.
108.523	As I thought about that later on,
110.958	I came up with a saying,
112.26	"which is, ""I collect bad wines."""
115.357	Because if the wine is ready
115.357	and the person is there, I'm opening it.
118.69	I no longer want to postpone
118.69	anything in life.
121.932	And that urgency, that purpose,
121.932	has really changed my life.
126.498	The second thing I learned that day --
128.604	and this is as we clear
128.604	the George Washington Bridge,
131.26	which was by not a lot --
133.468	(Laughter)
135.067	I thought about, wow,
135.067	I really feel one real regret.
138.772	I've lived a good life.
140.26	In my own humanity and mistakes,
142.26	I've tried to get better
142.26	at everything I tried.
145.118	But in my humanity,
145.118	I also allow my ego to get in.
149.302	And I regretted the time I wasted
149.302	on things that did not matter
153.577	with people that matter.
156.057	And I thought about
156.057	my relationship with my wife,
158.46	with my friends, with people.
161.122	And after, as I reflected on that,
163.087	I decided to eliminate
163.087	negative energy from my life.
165.638	It's not perfect, but it's a lot better.
168.042	I've not had a fight
168.042	with my wife in two years.
170.806	It feels great.
172.042	I no longer try to be right;
174.366	I choose to be happy.
177.314	The third thing I learned --
178.799	and this is as your mental clock
178.799	"starts going, ""15, 14, 13."""
183.264	You can see the water coming.
184.724	"I'm saying, ""Please blow up."""
186.26	I don't want this thing
186.26	to break in 20 pieces
188.427	like you've seen in those documentaries.
191.26	And as we're coming down,
193.545	I had a sense of, wow, dying is not scary.
198.26	It's almost like we've been preparing
198.26	for it our whole lives.
201.963	But it was very sad.
203.622	I didn't want to go; I love my life.
206.467	And that sadness
206.467	really framed in one thought,
210.716	which is, I only wish for one thing.
214.072	I only wish I could see my kids grow up.
217.757	About a month later,
217.757	I was at a performance by my daughter --
221.258	first-grader, not much artistic talent --
223.989	(Laughter)
225.087	Yet!
226.214	(Laughter)
228.092	And I'm bawling,
228.092	I'm crying, like a little kid.
233.264	And it made all the sense
233.264	in the world to me.
235.844	I realized at that point,
235.844	by connecting those two dots,
239.609	that the only thing
239.609	that matters in my life
241.975	is being a great dad.
244.152	Above all, above all,
246.883	the only goal I have in life
246.883	is to be a good dad.
250.58	I was given the gift of a miracle,
253.129	of not dying that day.
254.657	I was given another gift,
256.494	which was to be able
256.494	to see into the future
259.045	and come back
260.346	and live differently.
263.158	I challenge you guys
263.158	that are flying today,
266.174	imagine the same thing
266.174	happens on your plane --
268.849	and please don't --
270.26	but imagine, and how would you change?
272.877	What would you get done
274.181	that you're waiting to get done
274.181	because you think you'll be here forever?
277.881	How would you change your relationships
279.852	and the negative energy in them?
281.56	And more than anything,
281.56	are you being the best parent you can?
285.004	Thank you.
286.061	(Applause)
