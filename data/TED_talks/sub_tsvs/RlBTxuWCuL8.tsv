25.944	Over the past couple of days,
27.357	as I've been preparing for my speech,
29.158	I've become more and more nervous
29.158	about what I'm going to say
32.722	and about being on the same stage
32.722	as all these fascinating people.
35.865	Being on the same stage as Al Gore,
35.865	who was the first person I ever voted for.
40.179	And --
41.363	(Laughter)
45	So I was getting pretty nervous
46.814	and, you know, I didn't know
46.814	that Chris sits on the stage,
49.643	and that's more nerve-racking.
51.151	But then I started thinking
51.151	about my family.
53.231	I started thinking about my father
53.231	and my grandfather
56	and my great-grandfather,
58.087	and I realized
59.779	that I had all of these Teds
59.779	going through my bloodstream --
64.049	(Laughter)
65.471	"that I had to consider this ""my element."""
69	So, who am I?
71.401	Chris kind of mentioned I started
71.401	a company with my husband.
75.054	We have about 125 people internationally.
77.497	If you looked in the book,
79	you saw this ...
80.608	(Laughter)
81.901	which I really was appalled by.
85.197	(Laughter)
87.624	And because I wanted
87.624	to impress you all with slides,
91	since I saw the great presentations
91	yesterday with graphs,
93.762	I made a graph that moves,
96.104	and I talk about the makeup of me.
99	(Laughter)
102.37	So, besides this freakish thing,
104.447	this is my science slide.
105.723	This is math, and this is science,
105.723	this is genetics.
108.315	This is my grandmother,
108.315	and this is where I get this mouth.
111.211	(Laughter)
113.183	So --
115.163	I'm a blogger, which, probably,
115.163	to a lot of you, means different things.
119.243	You may have heard
119.243	about the Kryptonite lock brouhaha,
123.319	where a blogger talked about how you hack
125.327	or break into a Kryptonite
125.327	lock using a ballpoint pen,
128	and it spread all over.
129.373	Kryptonite had to adjust the lock,
131.363	and they had to address it
131.363	to avoid too many customer concerns.
135	You may have heard about Rathergate,
136.999	which was basically the result of bloggers
140.13	"realizing that the ""th"" in 111"
144.174	is not typeset on an old typewriter;
147.371	it's on Word.
148.671	Bloggers exposed this,
150.408	or they worked hard to expose this.
153	You know, blogs are scary.
153	This is what you see.
155.591	I see this, and I'm sure scared --
155.591	I swear on stage -- shitless about blogs,
161.088	because this is not
161.088	something that's friendly.
164.096	But there are blogs that are changing
164.096	the way we read news
167.746	and consume media,
167.746	and these are great examples.
170.167	These people are reaching thousands,
172.476	if not millions, of readers,
174.346	and that's incredibly important.
176	During the hurricane,
178	you had MSNBC posting
178	about the hurricane on their blog,
181.338	updating it frequently.
182.704	This was possible because of the easy
182.704	nature of blogging tools.
186	You have my friend,
187.739	who has a blog on PVRs,
187.739	personal recorders.
192.298	He makes enough money just by running ads,
194.592	to support his family up in Oregon.
196.433	That's all he does now,
197.608	and this is something
197.608	that blogs have made possible.
200.074	And then you have something
200.074	like this, which is Interplast.
202.882	It's a wonderful organization
204.484	of people and doctors
204.484	who go to developing nations
208.693	to offer plastic surgery
208.693	to those who need it.
211	Children with cleft palates get it,
211	and they document their story.
214.686	This is wonderful.
216	I am not that caring.
219	(Laughter)
221.751	I talk about myself.
222.951	That's what I am. I'm a blogger.
224.568	I have always decided that I was going
224.568	to be an expert on one thing,
228.121	and I am an expert on this person,
230.375	and so I write about it.
232.842	So, the short story about my blog:
234.509	it started in 2001, I was 23.
236.684	I wasn't happy with my job,
238.432	because I was a designer,
239.908	but I wasn't being really stimulated.
241.852	I was an English major in college.
243.509	I didn't have any use for it,
243.509	but I missed writing.
246.208	So, I started to write a blog
247.866	and I started to create things
247.866	like these little stories.
250.763	This was an illustration about my camp
250.763	experience when I was 11 years old,
255	and how I went to a YMCA camp,
255	Christian camp,
258	and basically by the end,
259.64	I had made my friends hate me so much
259.64	that I hid in a bunk,
264.544	They couldn't find me,
264.544	they sent a search party,
266.824	and I overheard people saying
266.824	they wish I had killed myself --
269.825	jumped off Bible Peak.
271.691	You can laugh, this is OK.
273.36	(Laughter)
274.776	This is me.
277	This is what happened to me.
278.493	And when I started my blog,
278.493	it was really this one goal --
282	"I said, ""I am not going"
282	to be famous to the world,
287.72	but I could be famous
287.72	"to people on the Internet."""
290.198	And I set a goal.
291.382	"I said, ""I'm going to win an award,"""
293.792	because I had never won
293.792	an award in my entire life.
296.234	"And I said, ""I'm going to win"
296.234	"the South by Southwest Weblog award."""
300.189	And I won it -- I reached
300.189	all of these people,
303	and I had tens of thousands of people
303	reading about my life every day.
306.511	And then I wrote a post about a banjo.
309.319	I wrote a post
311.081	about wanting to buy a banjo --
313.661	a $300 banjo, which is a lot of money.
316.613	And I don't play instruments;
318.32	I don't know anything about music.
320.515	I like music, and I like banjos,
323	and I think I probably heard
323	Steve Martin playing,
325.404	"and I said, ""I could do that."""
327	And I said to my husband,
328.317	"""Ben, can I buy a banjo?"""
328.317	"And he's like, ""No."""
330.531	And my husband --
331.786	(Laughter)
332.972	this is my husband, who is very hot --
335.04	he won an award for being hot.
337	(Laughter)
339.672	He told me,
341.561	"""You cannot buy a banjo."
343	"You're just like your dad,"""
343	who collects instruments.
346.199	And I wrote a post
346.199	about how I was so mad at him,
350.096	he was such a tyrant --
350.096	he would not let me buy this banjo.
352.969	And those people who know me
352.969	understood my joke --
355.355	this is Mena, this is how
355.355	I make a joke at people.
357.728	Because the joke in this
357.728	is that this person is not a tyrant,
361	this person is so loving and so sweet
363	that he lets me dress him up
364.813	and post pictures of him to my blog.
367.927	(Laughter)
371.774	And if he knew I was showing
371.774	this right now -- I put this in today --
375.124	he would kill me.
376.981	But the thing was, my friends read it,
379.325	"and they're like, ""Oh, that Mena,"
379.325	she wrote a post
381.776	about wanting a stupid thing
381.776	"and being stupid."""
384.268	But I got emails from people that said,
386.748	"""Oh my God, your husband"
386.748	is such an asshole.
389.835	How much money does
389.835	he spend on beer in a year?
392.67	You could take that money
392.67	and buy your banjo.
395.686	"Why don't you open a separate account?"""
397.575	I've been with him since I was 17,
397.575	we've never had a separate bank account.
401.151	"They said, ""Separate your bank account."
403.056	Spend your money;
403.056	"spend his money, that's it."""
405.263	"And then I got people saying, ""Leave him."""
407.416	(Laughter)
408.587	"I was like, ""OK, what?"
408.587	Who are these people?
411.462	"And why are they reading this?"""
413	And I realized: I don't
413	want to reach these people.
415.409	I don't want to write
415.409	for this public audience.
418	And I started to kill my blog slowly.
420	I'm like, I don't want
420	to write this anymore.
422.126	Slowly and slowly --
423.77	And I did tell personal
423.77	stories from time to time.
426.782	I wrote this one, and I put this
426.782	up because of Einstein today.
429.718	I'm going to get choked up,
429.718	because this is my first pet,
432.421	and she passed away two years ago.
434.073	"And I decided to break from, ""I don't"
434.073	"really write about my public life,"""
437.555	because I wanted to give her
437.555	a little memorial.
439.785	But anyways, it's these sorts
439.785	of personal stories --
442.3	You know, you read the blogs
442.3	about politics or about media,
445.115	and gossip and all these things.
446.669	These are out there,
447.851	but it's more of the personal
447.851	that interests me,
451	and this is who I am.
453.292	You see Norman Rockwell,
453.292	and you have art critics say,
455.869	"""Norman Rockwell is not art."
457.32	Norman Rockwell hangs
457.32	in living rooms and bathrooms,
460.476	and this is not something
460.476	"to be considered high art."""
464	And I think this is one
464	of the most important things
466.807	to us as humans.
469.069	These things resonate with us,
471.691	and, if you think about blogs,
471.691	you think of high art blogs,
474.739	the history paintings about,
474.739	you know, all the biblical stories,
478.729	and then you have this.
479.904	These are the blogs that interest me:
479.904	the people that just tell stories.
483.62	One story is about this baby,
483.62	and his name is Odin.
487.588	His father was a blogger.
489.794	And he was writing his blog one day,
492.688	and his wife gave birth to her baby
495.313	at 25 weeks.
497	And he never expected this.
498.773	One day, it was normal;
498.773	the next day, it was hell.
502	And this is a one-pound baby.
503.798	So Odin was documented every single day.
507	Pictures were taken every day:
507	day one, day two ...
509.696	You have day nine --
509.696	they're talking about his apnea;
512.609	day 39 -- he gets pneumonia.
514.49	His baby is so small,
516	and I've never encountered such a --
519.381	just -- a disturbing image,
519.381	but just so heartfelt.
523.639	And you're reading this as it happens,
526.806	so on day 55, everybody reads
526.806	that he's having failures:
530.935	breathing failures and heart failures,
532.813	and it's slowing down,
532.813	and you don't know what to expect.
536	But then it gets better.
536	Day 96, he goes home.
539.236	And you see this post.
541.346	That's not something you're going
541.346	to see in a paper or magazine
544.4	but this is something this person feels,
546.378	and people are excited
546.378	about it -- 28 comments.
548.783	That's not a huge amount
548.783	of people reading,
550.87	but 28 people matter.
552.664	And today, he is a healthy baby,
555.599	who, if you read his blog --
557.758	it's snowdeal.org, his father's blog --
560.837	he is taking pictures of him still,
560.837	because he is still his son
564.024	and he is, I think,
564.024	at his age level right now
567	because he had received such
567	great treatment from the hospital.
571.317	So, blogs.
572.882	So what? You've probably
572.882	heard these things before.
575.453	We talked about the WELL,
575.453	and about all these sorts of things
579.12	throughout our online history.
581	But I think blogs are basically
581	just an evolution,
584.662	and that's where we are today.
586.329	It's this record
586.329	of who you are, your persona.
588.949	You have your Google search,
588.949	"where you say, ""What is Mena Trott?"""
592.038	And then you find these things
592.038	and you're happy or unhappy.
595.808	But then you also find people's blogs,
598	and those are the records of people
598	that are writing daily --
600.922	not necessarily about the same topic,
600.922	but things that interest them.
604.866	And we talk about the world
604.866	flattens, being in this panel,
608.636	and I am very optimistic --
608.636	whenever I think about blogs,
611.757	"I'm like, ""We've got to reach"
611.757	"all these people."""
614.039	Hundreds of millions
614.039	and billions of people.
616.142	We're getting into China,
616.142	we want to be there,
618.312	but there are so many people that
618.312	won't have the access to write a blog.
622.037	But to see something
622.037	like the $100 computer is amazing,
624.798	because blogging software is simple.
626.872	We have a successful company
626.872	because of timing,
629.139	and because of perseverance,
629.139	but it's simple stuff --
631.671	it's not rocket science.
633.206	And so, that's an amazing
633.206	thing to consider.
636.615	So --
639.294	the life record of a blog is something
639.294	that I find incredibly important.
644.187	And we started with a slide of my Teds,
646.508	and I had to add this slide,
648.19	because I knew the minute
648.19	I showed this, my mom --
650.584	my mom will see this,
650.584	because she does read my blog
653.15	"and she'll say, ""Why wasn't there"
653.15	"a picture of me?"""
655.662	This is my mom.
656.903	So, I have all the people that I know of.
659.197	But this is basically the extent
659.197	of the family that I know
663.147	in terms of my direct line.
666.055	I showed a Norman Rockwell painting
666.055	before, and this one, I grew up with,
670.162	looking at constantly.
672	I would spend hours
672	looking at the connections,
674.22	"saying, ""Oh, the little kid"
674.22	up at the top has red hair;
677	"so does that first generation up there."""
679	And it's just these little things.
680.666	This is not science,
680.666	but this was enough for me
684.617	to be really interested
684.617	in how we have evolved
688	and how we can trace our line.
690.75	So that has always influenced me.
693.285	I have this record, this 1910 census,
696.921	of another Grabowski --
696.921	that's my maiden name --
699.452	and there's a Theodore,
699.452	because there's always a Theodore.
702.213	This is all I have,
702.213	a couple of facts about somebody.
705.869	I have their date of birth, their age,
705.869	what they did in their household,
710.034	if they spoke English,
711.209	and that's it, that's all I know
711.209	of these people.
713.572	And it's pretty sad,
715	because I only go back
715	five generations, and that's it.
718.667	I don't even know what happens
718.667	on my mom's side,
720.958	because she's from Cuba
720.958	and I don't have that many things.
724.999	Just doing this,
724.999	I spent time in the archives --
727.329	that's why my husband's a saint --
728.997	I spent time in the Washington archives,
730.949	just sitting there,
730.949	looking for these things.
733.078	Now it's online, but he sat through that.
735.082	And so you have this record and --
737.597	This is my great-great-grandmother.
739.709	This is the only picture I have.
741.36	And to think of what we have the ability
741.36	to do with our blogs;
745.647	to think about the people
745.647	that are on those $100 computers,
749	talking about who they are,
749	sharing these personal stories --
752.665	this is an amazing thing.
754.784	Another photo that has
754.784	greatly influenced me,
758	or a series of photos, is this project
760	that's done by an Argentinean
760	man and his wife.
763.297	And he's basically taking a picture
763.297	of his family every day
766.495	for the past, what is '76? -- 20 ...
766.495	Oh my God, I'm '77 -- 29 years?
772.287	Twenty-nine years.
775.061	There was a joke, originally,
775.061	about my graph that I left out, which is:
778.449	You see all this math?
779.63	I'm just happy I was able
779.63	to add it up to 100,
781.829	because that's my skill set.
783.648	(Laughter)
785.886	So you have these people aging,
788.571	and now this is them today, or last year.
792.205	And that's a powerful thing
792.205	to have, to be able to track this.
795.174	I wish that I would have
795.174	this of my family.
798	I know that one day my children
798	will be wondering --
802	or my grandchildren,
802	or my great-grandchildren,
804.263	if I ever have children --
806.361	what I am going to --
809	who I was.
810.311	So I do something
810.311	that's very narcissistic --
812.586	I am a blogger --
814.102	that is an amazing thing for me,
816.586	because it captures
816.586	a moment in time every day.
819.585	I take a picture of myself --
819.585	I've been doing this since last year --
822.869	every single day.
824.198	And, you know, it's the same picture;
826.048	it's basically the same person.
827.829	Only a couple of people read it.
829.432	I don't write this for this audience;
831.309	I'm showing it now, but I would go
831.309	insane if this was really public.
835.34	About four people probably read it,
837.055	"and they tell me, ""You haven't updated."""
839.427	I'm probably going to get people
839.427	telling me I haven't updated.
842.411	But this is amazing, because I can
842.411	go back to a day -- to April 2005,
846	and say, what was I doing this day?
847.696	I look at it, I know exactly.
849.12	It's this visual cue
849.12	that is so important to what we do.
852.14	I put the bad pictures up too,
854.263	because there are bad pictures.
856.693	(Laughter)
857.883	And I remember instantly:
857.883	I am in Germany in this --
861.567	I had to go for a one-day trip.
863.091	I was sick, and I was in a hotel room,
865.779	and I wanted not to be there.
867.579	And so you see these things,
867.579	it's not just always smiling.
870.53	Now I've kind of evolved it,
870.53	so I have this look.
872.867	If you look at my driver's license,
872.867	I have the same look,
875.583	and it's a pretty disturbing thing,
878.886	but it's something
878.886	that is really important.
881.724	And the last story
881.724	I really want to tell is this story,
887.136	because this is probably the one
887.136	that means the most to me
890.433	in all of what I'm doing.
891.7	I'll probably get choked up,
891.7	because I tend to when I talk about this.
895.048	So, this woman, her name was Emma,
897.2	and she was a blogger
897.2	on our service, TypePad.
900.264	And she was a beta tester,
900.264	so she was there right when we opened --
903.449	you know, there was 100 people.
905	And she wrote about her life
905	dealing with cancer.
908	She was writing and writing,
908	and we all started reading it,
911.16	because we had
911.16	so few blogs on the service,
913.251	we could keep track of everyone.
914.886	And she was writing one day,
916.881	and then she disappeared for a little bit.
919.159	And her sister came on, and she said
919.159	that Emma had passed away.
923.598	And all of our support staff who had
923.598	talked to her were really emotional,
928.482	and it was a very hard day at the company.
931.665	And this was one of those
931.665	instances where I realized
935	how much blogging
935	affects our relationship,
937.732	and flattening this sort of world.
939.418	That this woman is in England,
941.126	and she lives -- she lived -- a life
944.387	where she was talking
944.387	about what she was doing.
947.673	But the big thing
947.673	that really influenced us was,
951.226	her sister wrote to me, and she said --
953.136	and she wrote on this blog --
954.564	that writing her blog during
954.564	the last couple of months of her life
957.824	was probably the best thing
957.824	that had happened to her,
960.341	and being able to talk to people
960.341	and to share what was going on,
963.433	and being able to write
963.433	and receive comments.
966.346	And that was amazing,
967.538	to be able to know
967.538	that we had empowered that,
969.824	and that blogging was something
969.824	that she felt comfortable doing,
973.028	and the idea that blogging
973.028	doesn't have to be scary,
976.187	that we don't always have
976.187	to be attack of the blogs,
978.694	that we can be people who are open,
978.694	and wanting to help and talk to people.
982.401	That was an amazing thing.
984	And so I printed out and sent
984	a PDF of her blog to her family,
989.511	and they passed it
989.511	out at her memorial service,
991.734	and even in her obituary,
991.734	they mentioned her blog,
994.12	because it was such
994.12	a big part of her life.
996.153	And that's a huge thing.
997.414	So, this is her legacy,
1000.403	and I think that my call to action
1000.403	to all of you is:
1003.723	think about blogs,
1003.723	think about what they are,
1005.904	think about what you've thought of them,
1007.856	and then actually do it,
1009.045	because it's something
1009.045	that's really going to change our lives.
1012.067	So, thank you.
1013.253	(Applause)
