26	Welcome to Africa! Or rather, I should say, welcome home.
30	Because this is where it all really began, isn't it?
33	Looking at fossils dating back several millions of years --
36	it all points to evidence that life
38	for the human species as we know it began right here.
44	We are on an amazing journey the next four days.
48	"You're going to hear stories of ""Africa: The Next Chapter."""
52	Fantastic tales, anecdotes from speakers.
54	But I want to turn that upside down for a moment,
58	and get something out on the table and clear the air so to say.
63	What's the worst thing you've ever heard about Africa?
66	And this is not a rhetorical question.
67	I actually want answers from you.
70	Go for it! The worst.
73	Famine.
75	Corruption.
77	More.
79	Genocide.
81	AIDS.
84	Slavery.
88	That's enough.
90	We've all heard these things.
92	But this is about Africa, the story we have not heard.
96	The stories that we want to know,
98	and the stories that do exist about positive tales.
102	A part of my talk is going to be about investment opportunities
106	that exist on this continent,
108	to separate the rhetoric from the reality, the fact from the fiction.
112	To go to the actual data and statistics that exist
115	about the actual things that are happening on the ground
118	that make Africa a realistic investment opportunity and option for you.
125	So let's get going because Africa,
126	to some degree, is on a turnaround.
130	A turnaround in terms of how it manages its image,
134	and how it takes control of its own destiny.
137	And turnarounds are part and parcel
139	of what I have focused on for most of my professional career.
143	And it all started almost a decade ago,
146	as a young consultant at McKinsey &amp; Company
148	at their first African office in Johannesburg.
151	And there we worked with leading CEOs
154	on African issues, and African companies on turnarounds,
157	making the companies not just the best in Africa
160	but the best globally.
162	But I really formalized this focus on turnarounds
166	when I was completing my MBA in the United States.
169	It all began with a fantastic phone call.
171	It was from Rosabeth Moss Kanter,
174	Harvard Business School guru and a professor of mine.
176	"And she said, ""I want to write a case, Euvin --"
179	a case on a public-sector leader
181	"that has lessons for the corporate world."""
185	And the leader that came to mind was Nelson Mandela.
189	Because Nelson Mandela, as he took over power
192	as the first democratically-elected president of South Africa,
195	faced a situation of a country
197	that could have slid into the abyss of chaos.
200	But he started the country on a path of a positive cycle.
204	"Now the case, ""Nelson Mandela: Change Leader,"""
207	became part of the research base for a chapter
210	"in Rosabeth's new book called ""Confidence."""
214	"And ""Confidence"" became a New York Times bestseller"
218	and topped Business Week's hardcover bestseller list.
221	And why I tell you this story is because later, when I was interviewed
224	on SABC Africa, on a pan-African broadcast, they asked,
227	"""What is your key lesson, or the key thing you enjoy the most?"" --"
231	because it was a huge privilege to be part of such a project.
234	The lesson from that was that it was Africa -- an African story --
239	that was used to share news with the rest of the world
243	of what the benchmark can be for corporate turnarounds.
246	Africa was being used as a success story!
251	So I want to share with you a personal story
253	about a turnaround or a transformation.
255	And that has to do with me
257	because in 1994, I packed a few things into a backpack
261	and headed off for a year of travel
263	in the middle of my university career.
266	You should have seen my parents' reaction!
268	(Laughter)
269	But very soon, I found myself from the southern part of Africa,
273	in South Africa -- at the very north, in Egypt.
276	And I sought out the most remote places.
278	I went to the Siwa Oasis. That was one of my stops.
281	And the Siwa Oasis is famous for several things,
283	but the key thing is that it was the place
285	that Alexander the Great went to
288	when he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him.
291	And legend has it that Alexander trekked through this desert.
294	Half his battalion was wiped out in the sandstorm.
297	And myth says that he had an audience with the oracle,
300	and it foretold his destiny of greatness.
303	This was 300 BC.
305	So Africa had long been seen as a place to go to for answers.
311	Now, the thing I remember about Siwa
314	was the magical view of the sky at night.
317	With no natural light source, Siva is one of these amazing places
320	that when you look up you see a perfect tapestry.
324	Fast forward to 2002.
326	I'm sitting in Cambridge, Massachusetts
328	at the Healthcare Development Conference.
330	And I see the same picture, but from the opposite side.
333	A satellite picture looking down at the earth.
338	And it was that picture that made such a profound impact on me
341	because I'll never forget it. I remember the very moment.
344	And I wanted to share that image with you of what I saw at that point.
350	The first thing that I saw was North America at night --
355	glowing, in all its glory. A warm feeling. Light.
365	"And then I saw it -- Africa. Quite literally the ""Dark Continent."""
375	And while Africa may be dark,
377	the thing that brought the message home to me
380	was that this is the challenge we are facing,
383	but it's also the opportunity.
386	Because whilst Africa may be dark -- other than the few specks
389	that exist north and in the south and other areas --
393	it's aglow with the light in the hearts
395	of the millions of people that are there.
397	Entrepreneurs, dynamic people, people with hope.
401	It was George Kimble, the geographer, who said
404	"that, ""The only thing dark about Africa is our ignorance of it."""
409	So let's start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent
413	that has so much to offer.
415	Let's start unpacking it.
420	Africa is the second-largest continent, a landmass second from Asia.
427	It also is the second most populated continent,
429	with 900 million people.
431	In fact -- coming back to the land mass -- Africa is so big
434	that you could fit in the continental United States,
437	China, and the entire Europe into Africa, and still have space.
442	Africa is home to over 1,000 languages --
445	2,000 is another estimate that's out there --
448	with over 2,000 languages and dialects.
451	"But you could say, ""Invest in Africa in over 1,000 languages,"
455	"and it wouldn't make a difference."""
458	What does the data say?
460	As an investment banker, I'm in the cross-flow of information
464	and the changes that are taking place in capital markets.
467	So I want to share with you some of these bellwether signals, or signs,
470	and winds of change that are sweeping this continent.
472	So let's start on that.
474	And let's start at the high level, on the macro-factors.
476	Inflation, in general, is coming down across Africa --
479	that's the first sign --
481	in many countries reaching double-digit figures.
483	So let's start looking at some of those.
485	I call it my Z.E.N. cluster.
487	Zambia: from 2004 to 2006, moves from the 18 percent in inflation
492	to the nine percent.
494	Egypt: from the 16 percent to about 8.4 percent.
499	Nigeria: a similar situation,
501	from the 16 percent to the eight percent. Single digits.
507	More fascinating, you have other countries -- South Africa,
511	Mauritius, Namibia -- all in single digits.
518	But that's just part of the story. You have a similar trend with currencies --
521	currencies going through an extreme time of stability.
527	But that's looking at the big picture.
529	And the first myth to dispel is that Africa is not a country.
535	It's made up --
537	(Applause)
538	It's made up of 53 different countries.
542	"So the very definition -- to say ""invest in Africa"" is a no-go."
546	It's meaningless.
548	Each country has a unique value proposition.
551	You can make money, you can lose money in Africa.
554	But opportunities, boy oh boy, they exist.
557	And this is what today is about --
560	it's about discussing those very opportunities.
564	So let's start getting into the countries
566	and into the specific material and data.
571	I was recently elected, as Emeka mentioned,
573	as the President of the South African Chamber of Commerce in America.
576	And I'm very proud and happy to be in that role
579	because it is a fascinating position to be in.
581	To hear this dialogue that's just increasing in tenor and velocity,
585	of decisions about trade and companies wanting to come.
589	So the first port of call: let's talk a little bit about South Africa.
591	But not the South Africa we always talk about --
593	the gold, the minerals, the First World infrastructure --
596	a bit about the other side of it.
598	For example, South Africa was recently voted as the top destination
602	for the top 1,000 UK companies for offshore call-centers.
606	Same language, timeline, et cetera. Makes sense.
611	Other headlines that have recently reached South Africa
613	were Bain Capital and KKR, the big boys of private equity.
618	"Headline in South Africa: ""They have landed."" Quite ominous."
621	But what were they there for? To acquire assets.
625	Bing Capital's acquisition of Edcon, a large retailer, is testimony
632	to the confidence they are starting to place in the economy.
635	Because it is actually a long-term play.
637	Being a retailer, it is a play on the belief
639	that this middle-class that's growing will continue to grow,
643	that the boom and the confidence in consumer spending will continue.
649	But the story of Africa, and my focus, is beyond South Africa
654	because there's so much happening.
656	Undoubtedly, Nigeria is clearly a hot spot.
660	Challenges -- and we will hear a lot about Nigeria in these four days.
664	But looking at Goldman Sachs' work -- we had the famous BRIC Report.
669	"The new report, ""The Next Eleven,"" highlights that by 2020"
673	Nigeria is going to be amongst the top 10 economies in the world.
677	It's an investment opportunity. Think about that.
681	Is anyone -- our banks, our investors --
684	seriously thinking about going to Nigeria?
685	If you haven't, why not?
687	What's going on in Nigeria? A couple of things.
691	I want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets.
695	Bellwether signs again.
698	Guarantee Trust Bank recently issued the first Euro Bond
702	out of Africa, and this excludes South Africa.
705	But the first Eurobond, the raising of international capital
708	offshore, off its own balance sheet,
711	without any sovereign backing --
713	that is an indication of the confidence that is taking place in that economy.
717	Without any sovereign backing,
719	a Nigerian company raising capital offshore.
721	It's just a sign of things to come.
722	Looking at the oil industry, Africa provides 18 percent
727	of the U.S.'s oil supply, with the Middle East just 16 percent.
731	It's an important strategic partner.
733	Let's put Nigeria in perspective.
735	2.2 to 2.4 million barrels of oil a day --
738	the same league as Kuwait, the same league as Venezuela.
743	But with Africa, let's start being careful about this.
746	And Emeka and I have had these discussions.
748	"We have to move away from what's called ""the curse of the commodities."""
752	Because it's not about oil, it's not about commodities.
754	For Africa to truly be sustainable,
756	we have to move beyond to other industries.
759	So let's unpack those very quickly,
761	and I'm going to move through these very, very, very fast
763	because I can see that clock counting down.
767	What else is going on there? Egypt.
770	Egypt is launching a first large industrial zone --
773	2.8 billion investment.
775	The announcement just came out the last few weeks.
777	Close to the Mediterranean, near Alexandria --
781	textiles, petrochemicals.
783	It's being managed by a Singaporean-based management company.
787	So they want to emerge as an industrial powerhouse
790	across the industries -- away from oil.
792	Let's look at agriculture. Let's look at forestry.
795	What's going on there?
796	In Tanzania last week, we had the launch
800	of the East African Organic Produce Standard.
804	Again, gathering together farmers, gathering together stakeholders
809	in East Africa to get standards for organic produce. Better prices.
816	It ties in with small-scale farmers
819	in terms of no pesticides, no fertilizers.
824	Again, opportunity to tackle markets to get that higher price.
829	Uganda: the New Forest Company,
831	replanting and redeveloping their forests. Why is that important?
837	As the energy needs are met and electricity is needed [we will need]
840	poles for rolling out electricity.
842	But here is the sweetener in the deal.
844	They're going to be tapping into carbon credits.
848	Let's go back to Nigeria.
850	The banking sector has undergone tremendous transformation,
853	from over 80 banks to 25 banks. Strengthening of the system.
858	But what's going on there? Only 10 percent of the country is banked.
863	The largest population in Africa is in Nigeria.
870	There are only 700 ATMs in the country. Opportunity.
875	The same for telecoms across the country.
878	Now let's look at the continent as a whole.
880	People look at the roads, for example, and they'd say,
882	"""Angola: 90 percent of roads are untarred. Ah, problem!"""
889	It's more expensive to transport goods. Prices of goods go up,
892	inflation is affected.
894	Nigeria: 70 percent of roads are untarred. Zambia: 80 percent.
897	In general, more than 50 percent of roads are untarred.
900	This is an opportunity! Energy needs -- it's an opportunity.
905	So what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing?
908	Let's look at the stock markets in Africa.
911	"If I had to ask you, ""In 2005 what was the best performing stock market"
915	"or stock exchange in the world?"" Would Egypt come to mind?"
920	In 2005, the Egyptian stock exchange returned over 145 percent.
928	What's going on in some of the other countries?
930	Let's look at some 2006 numbers. Kenya: over 60 percent. Nigeria: over 40 percent.
937	South Africa: in the 20 percents. High ones.
940	These are the trends that are taking place.
946	But in any investment decision, the key question is,
950	"""What is my alternative investment?"""
953	Because in Africa today, we are competing globally for capital.
957	And global capital is agnostic -- it has no loyalties.
962	There's an overhang of capital in the U.S., and the key is yield pickup.
966	What Africa is providing is a diversification play,
969	and also opportunities for yield pickup for the investor
971	that's aware of what he or she is doing.
975	Now, when looking at Africa vis-a-vis other things,
977	and countries in Africa vis-a-vis other things,
979	comparisons become important.
984	that received sovereign ratings from
985	the Standard &amp; Poors, Moody's and Fitch's.
988	Today, 16 African countries and growing
992	have sovereign country ratings. What does this mean?
995	Take Nigeria again: double B-minus --
998	in the league of Ukraine and Turkey. Immediately we have a comparison.
1003	The backbone of making investment decisions
1006	for global holders of capital.
1008	Some other figures. South Africa: triple B-plus. Botswana: A-plus.
1015	Bakino Faso: B-minus. And so on.
1018	In fact, one of the big agencies is setting up an office in Africa.
1023	Why are they doing that? Because they expect investment to follow.
1029	So one of the big bellwethers,
1031	and one of my final points I want to mention, is
1034	the interesting thing I read is that CNBC
1036	has launched their first African channel. Why is CNBC doing this?
1041	It's the 24-hour rolling African news channel.
1045	They're doing it because they are expecting things to happen.
1048	Me and you, the investments we are going to be making,
1052	the investments the world is going to be making --
1053	that's the 24-hour news channel dedicated to Africa.
1057	So that's the change that's coming down the pipeline.
1062	So in conclusion, I want to turn back to that very slide
1067	that made such a deep impact on me all those years ago.
1072	This time [I'll] give you the entire picture that I saw in 2002,
1078	and ask you that when you think about what your role can be in Africa,
1083	think about your journey in terms of bringing light to this continent.
1087	Because there are amazing opportunities available.
1090	And think about the concept of transformation
1092	in the back of your mind
1094	because things can be turned around rather quickly.
1098	"In 1899, Joseph Conrad released ""The Heart of Darkness,"""
1105	a tale of grim horror along the Congo River.
1112	If one looks carefully, on the Congo River
1117	is one of those bright lights. And that's the very Congo river
1121	generating light -- the old heart of darkness
1124	now generating light with hydro-electric power.
1127	That is a transformation in power of ideas.
1130	So the next step, over the next four days,
1132	is us exploring more of these ideas.
1135	And perchance, if you can always keep this picture in your mind,
1138	that when we convene maybe in the distant future, in 2020,
1143	that picture will look very different.
1145	Thank you.
1147	(Applause)
