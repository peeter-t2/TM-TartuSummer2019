20.97	Whoa, dude.
23.61	(Laughter)
24.85	Check out those killer equations. Sweet.
30.57	Actually, for the next 18 minutes
30.57	I'm going to do the best I can
34.01	to describe the beauty
34.01	of particle physics without equations.
37.97	It turns out there's a lot
37.97	we can learn from coral.
41.45	A coral is a very beautiful
41.45	and unusual animal.
44.17	Each coral head consists
44.17	of thousands of individual polyps.
47.73	These polyps are continually
47.73	budding and branching
50.29	into genetically identical neighbors.
53.13	If we imagine this
53.13	to be a hyperintelligent coral,
56.21	we can single out an individual
56.21	and ask him a reasonable question.
59.41	We can ask how exactly
59.41	he got to be in this particular location
62.81	compared to his neighbors --
64.53	if it was just chance,
64.53	or destiny, or what?
68.05	Now, after admonishing us
68.05	for turning the temperature up too high,
72.33	he would tell us that our question
72.33	was completely stupid.
75.17	These corals can be kind of mean, you see,
77.194	and I have surfing scars to prove that.
79.833	But this polyp would continue and tell us
81.81	that his neighbors were
81.81	quite clearly identical copies of him.
84.89	That he was in all
84.89	these other locations as well,
87.25	but experiencing them
87.25	as separate individuals.
90.61	For a coral, branching
90.61	into different copies
92.97	is the most natural thing in the world.
95.65	Unlike us, a hyperintelligent coral
98.05	would be uniquely prepared
98.05	to understand quantum mechanics.
102.17	The mathematics of quantum mechanics
103.93	very accurately describes
103.93	how our universe works.
106.49	And it tells us our reality is continually
106.49	branching into different possibilities,
110.372	just like a coral.
112.81	It's a weird thing for us humans
112.81	to wrap our minds around,
115.57	since we only ever get
115.57	to experience one possibility.
118.45	This quantum weirdness was first described
120.474	by Erwin Schrödinger and his cat.
122.25	The cat likes this version better.
123.97	(Laughter)
127.77	In this setup, Schrödinger is in a box
127.77	with a radioactive sample
131.45	that, by the laws of quantum mechanics,
131.45	branches into a state
134.37	in which it is radiated
134.37	and a state in which it is not.
137.89	(Laughter)
141.97	In the branch in which
141.97	the sample radiates,
144.01	it sets off a trigger that releases poison
144.01	and Schrödinger is dead.
147.41	But in the other branch of reality,
147.41	he remains alive.
150.33	These realities are experienced
150.33	separately by each individual.
153.259	As far as either can tell,
153.259	the other one doesn't exist.
156.21	This seems weird to us,
157.45	because each of us
157.45	only experiences an individual existence,
160.33	and we don't get to see other branches.
162.45	It's as if each of us,
162.45	like Schrödinger here,
164.77	are a kind of coral
164.77	branching into different possibilities.
169.21	The mathematics
169.21	of quantum mechanics tells us
171.37	this is how the world
171.37	works at tiny scales.
173.69	It can be summed up in a single sentence:
176.65	Everything that can happen, does.
178.69	That's quantum mechanics.
180.17	But this does not mean everything happens.
182.93	The rest of physics is about describing
182.93	what can happen and what can't.
187.29	What physics tells us
187.29	is that everything comes down to geometry
190.45	and the interactions
190.45	of elementary particles.
193.17	And things can happen only if
193.17	these interactions are perfectly balanced.
198.93	Now I'll go ahead and describe
198.93	how we know about these particles,
202.01	what they are and how this balance works.
205.45	In this machine,
205.45	a beam of protons and antiprotons
208.41	are accelerated to near the speed of light
210.45	and brought together in a collision,
210.45	producing a burst of pure energy.
214.13	This energy is immediately converted
214.13	into a spray of subatomic particles,
218.05	with detectors and computers
218.05	used to figure out their properties.
221.37	This enormous machine --
222.65	the Large Hadron Collider
222.65	at CERN in Geneva --
224.85	has a circumference of 17 miles
224.85	and, when it's operating,
227.57	draws five times as much power
227.57	as the city of Monterey.
231.17	We can't predict specifically
233.05	what particles will be produced
233.05	in any individual collision.
236.01	Quantum mechanics tells us
236.01	all possibilities are realized.
239.41	But physics does tell us
239.41	what particles can be produced.
242.85	These particles must have
242.85	just as much mass and energy
245.41	as is carried in
245.41	by the proton and antiproton.
248.89	Any particles more massive
248.89	than this energy limit aren't produced,
252.17	and remain invisible to us.
255.17	This is why this new
255.17	particle accelerator is so exciting.
258.25	It's going to push
258.25	this energy limit seven times
260.53	beyond what's ever been done before,
262.29	so we're going to get to see
262.29	some new particles very soon.
265.69	But before talking
265.69	about what we might see,
267.85	let me describe the particles
267.85	we already know of.
270.73	There's a whole zoo
270.73	of subatomic particles.
273.53	Most of us are familiar with electrons.
275.45	A lot of people in this room
275.45	make a good living pushing them around.
278.69	(Laughter)
279.89	But the electron also has
279.89	a neutral partner called the neutrino,
282.93	with no electric charge
282.93	and a very tiny mass.
285.73	In contrast, the up and down quarks
285.73	have very large masses,
289.21	and combine in threes to make
289.21	the protons and neutrons inside atoms.
293.09	All of these matter particles
293.09	come in left- and right-handed varieties,
296.45	and have antiparticle partners
296.45	that carry opposite charges.
300.69	These familiar particles
301.97	also have less familiar
301.97	second and third generations,
305.01	which have the same charges as the first
305.01	but have much higher masses.
310.01	These matter particles all interact
310.01	with the various force particles.
313.57	The electromagnetic force
313.57	interacts with electrically charged matter
316.81	via particles called photons.
318.65	There is also a very weak force
320.21	called, rather unimaginatively,
320.21	the weak force ...
322.967	(Laughter)
324.13	that interacts
324.13	only with left-handed matter.
326.77	The strong force acts between quarks
328.81	which carry a different kind of charge,
328.81	called color charge,
331.97	and come in three different varieties:
331.97	red, green and blue.
334.77	You can blame Murray Gell-Mann
334.77	for these names -- they're his fault.
338.49	Finally, there's the force of gravity,
340.61	which interacts with matter
340.61	via its mass and spin.
343.73	The most important thing
343.73	to understand here
345.97	is that there's a different kind of charge
345.97	associated with each of these forces.
350.33	These four different forces
350.33	interact with matter
352.61	according to the corresponding charges
352.61	that each particle has.
356.97	A particle that hasn't been seen yet,
356.97	but we're pretty sure exists,
360.17	is the Higgs particle, which gives masses
360.17	to all these other particles.
363.89	The main purpose
363.89	of the Large Hadron Collider
366.05	is to see this Higgs particle,
366.05	and we're almost certain it will.
369.45	But the greatest mystery
369.45	is what else we might see.
373.49	And I'm going to show you
373.49	one beautiful possibility
375.93	towards the end of this talk.
378.53	Now, if we count up
378.53	all these different particles
380.89	using their various spins and charges,
382.77	there are 226.
384.73	That's a lot of particles
384.73	to keep track of.
387.21	And it seems strange
388.45	that nature would have
388.45	so many elementary particles.
392.01	But if we plot them out
392.01	according to their charges,
394.69	some beautiful patterns emerge.
398.45	The most familiar charge
398.45	is electric charge.
401.17	Electrons have an electric charge,
402.85	a negative one,
404.09	and quarks have
404.09	electric charges in thirds.
406.13	So when two up quarks and a down quark
406.13	are combined to make a proton,
409.41	it has a total
409.41	electric charge of plus one.
411.45	These particles also have antiparticles,
411.45	which have opposite charges.
414.73	Now, it turns out the electric charge
416.57	is actually a combination
416.57	of two other charges:
419.09	hypercharge and weak charge.
421.77	If we spread out
421.77	the hypercharge and weak charge
425.092	and plot the charges of particles
425.092	in this two-dimensional charge space,
428.45	the electric charge
428.45	is where these particles sit
430.73	along the vertical direction.
432.77	The electromagnetic
432.77	and weak forces interact with matter
435.45	according to their hypercharge
435.45	and weak charge,
437.69	which make this pattern.
438.97	This is called
438.97	the unified electroweak model,
441.13	and it was put together back in 1967.
444.05	The reason most of us
444.05	are only familiar with electric charge
446.93	and not both of these
446.93	is because of the Higgs particle.
450.73	The Higgs, over here on the left,
450.73	has a large mass
453.49	and breaks the symmetry
453.49	of this electroweak pattern.
455.97	It makes the weak force very weak
455.97	by giving the weak particles a large mass.
459.57	Since this massive Higgs sits along
459.57	the horizontal direction in this diagram,
463.69	the photons of electromagnetism
463.69	remain massless
466.01	and interact with electric charge
466.01	along the vertical direction
468.97	in this charge space.
472.29	So the electromagnetic and weak forces
474.17	are described by this pattern
474.17	of particle charges
476.53	in two-dimensional space.
477.93	We can include the strong force
477.93	by spreading out its two charge directions
482.93	and plotting the charges
482.93	of the force particles in quarks
485.65	along these directions.
487.57	The charges of all known particles
489.25	can be plotted in
489.25	a four-dimensional charge space,
491.65	and projected down to two dimensions
491.65	like this so we can see them.
494.85	Whenever particles interact,
494.85	nature keeps things in a perfect balance
498.65	along all four of these charge directions.
501.45	If a particle and an antiparticle collide,
503.53	it creates a burst of energy
503.53	and a total charge of zero
506.21	in all four charge directions.
508.25	At this point, anything can be created
510.29	as long as it has the same energy
510.29	and maintains a total charge of zero.
514.49	For example, this weak force particle
514.49	and its antiparticle
517.73	can be created in a collision.
519.53	In further interactions,
519.53	the charges must always balance.
522.45	One of the weak particles could decay
522.45	into an electron and an antineutrino,
527.49	and these three
527.49	still add to zero total charge.
530.17	Nature always keeps a perfect balance.
533.129	So these patterns of charges
533.129	are not just pretty.
536.09	They tell us what interactions
536.09	are allowed to happen.
538.61	And we can rotate this charge space
538.61	in four dimensions
541.249	to get a better look
541.249	at the strong interaction,
544.05	which has this nice hexagonal symmetry.
546.33	In a strong interaction,
546.33	a strong force particle,
549.69	such as this one,
550.93	interacts with a colored quark,
550.93	such as this green one,
554.49	to give a quark with a different
554.49	color charge -- this red one.
558.49	And strong interactions
558.49	are happening millions of times
561.13	each second in every atom of our bodies,
563.29	holding the atomic nuclei together.
567.33	But these four charges
567.33	corresponding to three forces
570.21	are not the end of the story.
572.25	We can also include two more charges
572.25	corresponding to the gravitational force.
576.21	When we include these,
577.53	each matter particle
577.53	has two different spin charges,
580.21	spin-up and spin-down.
582.21	So they all split and give a nice pattern
582.21	in six-dimensional charge space.
586.29	We can rotate this pattern
586.29	in six dimensions
589.29	and see that it's quite pretty.
593.53	Right now, this pattern
593.53	matches our best current knowledge
597.09	of how nature is built at the tiny scales
597.09	of these elementary particles.
601.37	This is what we know for certain.
603.01	Some of these particles
603.01	are at the very limit
605.17	of what we've been able to reach
605.17	with experiments.
607.57	From this pattern
608.81	we already know the particle physics
608.81	of these tiny scales --
612.17	the way the universe works
612.17	at these tiny scales is very beautiful.
617.45	But now I'm going to discuss
617.45	some new and old ideas
619.89	about things we don't know yet.
622.01	We want to expand this pattern
622.01	using mathematics alone,
625.17	and see if we can get our hands
625.17	on the whole enchilada.
627.81	We want to find
627.81	all the particles and forces
629.93	that make a complete picture
629.93	of our universe.
632.09	And we want to use this picture
632.09	to predict new particles
634.77	that we'll see when experiments
634.77	reach higher energies.
639.25	So there's an old idea in particle physics
641.53	that this known pattern of charges,
644.29	which is not very symmetric,
645.89	could emerge from a more perfect pattern
645.89	that gets broken --
648.77	similar to how the Higgs particle
648.77	breaks the electroweak pattern
651.81	to give electromagnetism.
653.49	In order to do this,
653.49	we need to introduce new forces
656.57	with new charge directions.
659.81	When we introduce a new direction,
661.53	we get to guess what charges
661.53	the particles have along this direction,
664.97	and then we can rotate it
664.97	in with the others.
668.05	If we guess wisely,
668.05	we can construct the standard charges
671.57	in six charge dimensions
671.57	as a broken symmetry
674.29	of this more perfect pattern
674.29	in seven charge dimensions.
678.37	This particular choice
678.37	corresponds to a grand unified theory
681.37	introduced by Pati and Salam in 1973.
684.77	When we look at this new unified pattern,
687.53	we can see a couple of gaps
687.53	where particles seem to be missing.
691.41	This is the way
691.41	theories of unification work.
694.29	A physicist looks for larger,
694.29	more symmetric patterns
696.85	that include the established
696.85	pattern as a subset.
700.01	The larger pattern allows us
700.01	to predict the existence of particles
703.17	that have never been seen.
705.57	This unification model
705.57	predicts the existence
707.85	of these two new force particles,
710.37	which should act a lot
710.37	like the weak force, only weaker.
714.49	Now, we can rotate this set
714.49	of charges in seven dimensions
717.25	and consider an odd fact
717.25	about the matter particles:
720.93	the second and third generations of matter
723.01	have exactly the same charges
723.01	in six-dimensional charge space
725.93	as the first generation.
727.81	These particles are not
727.81	uniquely identified by their six charges.
731.65	They sit on top of one another
731.65	in the standard charge space.
735.73	However, if we work
735.73	in eight-dimensional charge space,
739.37	then we can assign
739.37	unique new charges to each particle.
743.69	Then we can spin these in eight dimensions
746.77	and see what the whole pattern looks like.
750.313	Here we can see the second
750.313	and third generations of matter now,
753.29	related to the first generation
753.29	"by a symmetry called ""triality."""
757.85	This particular pattern
757.85	of charges in eight dimensions
761.37	is actually part of the most beautiful
761.37	geometric structure in mathematics.
766.09	It's a pattern of the largest
766.09	exceptional Lie group, E8.
770.05	This Lie group is a smooth,
770.05	curved shape with 248 dimensions.
774.09	Each point in this pattern
774.09	corresponds to a symmetry
777.09	of this very complex and beautiful shape.
780.09	One small part of this E8 shape
780.09	can be used to describe
782.89	the curved space-time
782.89	of Einstein's general relativity,
785.53	explaining gravity.
787.53	Together with quantum mechanics,
789.25	the geometry of this shape
789.25	could describe everything
791.73	about how the universe works
791.73	at the tiniest scales.
794.37	The pattern of this shape living
794.37	in eight-dimensional charge space
798.69	is exquisitely beautiful,
801.37	and it summarizes thousands
801.37	of possible interactions
803.85	between these elementary particles,
805.57	each of which is just a facet
805.57	of this complicated shape.
809.81	As we spin it, we can see
809.81	many of the other intricate patterns
812.77	contained in this one.
815.81	And with a particular rotation,
817.61	we can look down through this pattern
817.61	in eight dimensions along a symmetry axis
821.81	and see all the particles at once.
823.65	It's a very beautiful object,
825.25	and as with any unification,
827.65	we can see some holes where new particles
827.65	are required by this pattern.
832.17	There are 20 gaps
832.17	where new particles should be,
834.93	two of which have been filled
834.93	by the Pati-Salam particles.
837.69	From their location in this pattern,
837.69	we know that these new particles
840.97	should be scalar fields
840.97	like the Higgs particle,
843.33	but have color charge
843.33	and interact with the strong force.
846.57	Filling in these new particles
846.57	completes this pattern,
849.13	giving us the full E8.
850.49	This E8 pattern has
850.49	very deep mathematical roots.
853.53	It's considered by many to be the most
853.53	beautiful structure in mathematics.
857.61	It's a fantastic prospect that this object
857.61	of great mathematical beauty
861.77	could describe the truth
861.77	of particle interactions
864.13	at the smallest scales imaginable.
868.05	And this idea that nature is described
868.05	by mathematics is not at all new.
872.01	In 1623, Galileo wrote this:
875.69	"""Nature's grand book,"
875.69	which stands continually open to our gaze,
879.41	is written in the language of mathematics.
881.93	Its characters are triangles,
881.93	circles and other geometrical figures,
885.57	without which it is humanly impossible
885.57	to understand a single word of it;
889.45	without these, one is wandering around
889.45	"in a dark labyrinth."""
893.89	I believe this to be true,
895.77	and I've tried
895.77	to follow Galileo's guidance
897.81	in describing the mathematics
897.81	of particle physics
900.17	using only triangles, circles
900.17	and other geometrical figures.
903.57	Of course, when other physicists
903.57	and I actually work on this stuff,
907.33	the mathematics
907.33	can resemble a dark labyrinth.
911.25	But it's reassuring that at the heart
911.25	of this mathematics
914.13	is pure, beautiful geometry.
917.77	Joined with quantum mechanics,
919.25	this mathematics describes our universe
919.25	as a growing E8 coral,
923.21	with particles interacting
923.21	at every location in all possible ways
926.85	according to a beautiful pattern.
929.89	And as more of the pattern
929.89	comes into view using new machines
932.81	like the Large Hadron Collider,
934.65	we may be able to see whether nature
934.65	uses this E8 pattern or a different one.
940.09	This process of discovery is
940.09	a wonderful adventure to be involved in.
944.01	If the LHC finds particles
944.01	that fit this E8 pattern,
947.33	that will be very, very cool.
950.29	If the LHC finds new particles,
950.29	but they don't fit this pattern --
953.45	well, that will be very interesting,
953.45	but bad for this E8 theory.
957.97	And, of course, bad for me personally.
960.49	(Laughter)
962.69	Now, how bad would that be?
964.49	Well, pretty bad.
966.61	(Laughter)
969.73	But predicting how nature works
969.73	is a very risky game.
973.53	This theory and others like it
973.53	are long shots.
977.41	One does a lot of hard work
977.41	knowing that most of these ideas
980.29	probably won't end up
980.29	being true about nature.
982.49	That's what doing
982.49	theoretical physics is like:
984.69	there are a lot of wipeouts.
986.13	In this regard, new physics theories
986.13	are a lot like start-up companies.
991.69	As with any large investment,
993.13	it can be emotionally difficult
993.13	to abandon a line of research
996.05	when it isn't working out.
997.37	But in science,
997.37	if something isn't working,
999.45	you have to toss it out
999.45	and try something else.
1002.49	Now, the only way to maintain sanity
1004.25	and achieve happiness
1004.25	in the midst of this uncertainty
1006.89	is to keep balance
1006.89	and perspective in life.
1010.77	I've tried the best I can
1010.77	to live a balanced life.
1013.33	(Laughter)
1015.89	I try to balance my life equally
1015.89	between physics, love and surfing --
1019.49	my own three charge directions.
1021.33	(Laughter)
1023.49	This way, even if the physics
1023.49	I work on comes to nothing,
1026.21	I still know I've lived a good life.
1028.57	And I try to live in beautiful places.
1030.49	For most of the past ten years
1030.49	I've lived on the island of Maui,
1033.57	a very beautiful place.
1035.17	Now, it's one of the greatest mysteries
1035.17	in the universe to my parents
1038.89	how I managed to survive all that time
1040.77	without engaging in anything
1040.77	resembling full-time employment.
1043.689	(Laughter)
1047.29	I'm going to let you in on that secret.
1050.689	This was a view
1050.689	from my home office on Maui.
1054.89	And this is another,
1058.05	and another.
1059.49	And you may have noticed
1059.49	that these beautiful views are similar,
1062.53	but in slightly different places.
1064.97	That's because this used to be
1064.97	my home and office on Maui.
1068.41	(Laughter)
1070.21	I've chosen a very unusual life.
1073.05	But not worrying about rent
1074.41	allowed me to spend my time
1074.41	doing what I love.
1077.29	Living a nomadic existence
1077.29	has been hard at times,
1079.85	but it's allowed me
1079.85	to live in beautiful places
1082.09	and keep a balance in my life
1082.09	that I've been happy with.
1085.09	It allows me to spend a lot of my time
1085.09	hanging out with hyperintelligent coral.
1091.21	But I also greatly enjoy
1091.21	the company of hyperintelligent people.
1094.37	So I'm very happy
1094.37	to have been invited here to TED.
1097.65	Thank you very much.
1098.89	(Applause)
1105.53	Chris Anderson: Stay here one second.
1107.34	(Applause)
1110.946	I probably understood two percent of that,
1112.97	but I still absolutely loved it.
1116.57	So I'm going to sound dumb.
1118.21	Your theory of everything --
1120.57	Garrett Lisi: I'm used to coral.
1122.17	CA: That's right.
1123.45	The reason it's got
1123.45	a few people at least excited
1125.81	is because, if you're right, it brings
1125.81	gravity and quantum theory together.
1130.21	So are you saying that we should
1130.21	think of the universe, at its heart --
1134.05	that the smallest things that there are,
1136.77	are somehow an E8 object of possibility?
1142.97	I mean, is there a scale to it,
1142.97	at the smallest scale, or ...?
1146.01	GL: Well, right now
1146.01	the pattern I showed you
1148.89	that corresponds to what we know
1148.89	about elementary particle physics --
1153.53	that already corresponds
1153.53	to a very beautiful shape.
1155.97	And that's the one
1155.97	that I said we knew for certain.
1158.41	And that shape
1158.41	has remarkable similarities --
1161.53	and the way it fits into this E8 pattern,
1161.53	which could be the rest of the picture.
1166.45	And these patterns of points
1166.45	that I've shown for you
1169.93	actually represent symmetries
1169.93	of this high-dimensional object
1173.77	that would be warping
1173.77	and moving and dancing
1176.57	over the space-time that we experience.
1178.69	And that would be what explains all these
1178.69	elementary particles that we see.
1182.37	CA: But a string theorist,
1182.37	as I understand it,
1185.77	explains electrons in terms
1185.77	of much smaller strings vibrating --
1188.81	I know, you don't like string theory --
1188.81	vibrating inside it.
1192.13	How should we think
1192.13	of an electron in relation to E8?
1196.97	GL: Well, it would be one
1196.97	of the symmetries of this E8 shape.
1201.13	So what's happening is, as the shape
1201.13	is moving over space-time, it's twisting.
1206.53	And the direction it's twisting
1206.53	as it moves is what particle we see.
1211.01	So it would be --
1212.25	CA: The size of the E8 shape,
1212.25	how does that relate to the electron?
1215.45	I feel like I need that for my picture.
1215.45	Is it bigger? Is it smaller?
1218.69	GL: As far as we know,
1218.69	electrons are point particles,
1221.191	so this would be going down
1221.191	to the smallest possible scales.
1224.05	So the way these things are explained
1224.05	in quantum field theory is,
1227.89	all possibilities are expanding
1227.89	and developing at once.
1230.57	And this is why
1230.57	I use the analogy to coral.
1233.53	And --
1235.93	in this way, the way that E8 comes in
1240.25	is it will be as a shape that's attached
1240.25	at each point in the space-time.
1245.61	And, as I said,
1245.61	the way the shape twists --
1249.09	the directional along which way
1249.09	the shape is twisting
1251.61	as it moves over this curved surface --
1253.69	is what the elementary particles
1253.69	are, themselves.
1256.49	So through quantum field theory,
1259.17	they manifest themselves as points
1259.17	and interact that way.
1262.41	I don't know if I'll be able
1262.41	to make this any clearer.
1264.97	(Laughter)
1267.93	CA: It doesn't really matter.
1269.37	It's evoking a kind of sense of wonder,
1271.41	and I certainly
1271.41	want to understand more of this.
1276.21	But thank you so much for coming.
1276.21	That was absolutely fascinating.
1279.37	(Applause)
