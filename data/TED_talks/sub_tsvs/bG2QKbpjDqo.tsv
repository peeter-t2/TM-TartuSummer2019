26	It's very, very difficult
31	to speak at the end of a conference like this,
34	because everyone has spoken. Everything has been said.
37	So I thought that what may be useful is to remind us
41	of some of the things that have gone on here,
44	and then maybe offer some ideas which we can take away,
47	and take forward and work on.
52	That's what I'd like to try and do.
53	"We came here saying we want to talk about ""Africa: the Next Chapter."""
58	"But we are talking about ""Africa: the Next Chapter"""
60	because we are looking at the old and the present chapter -- that we're looking at,
66	and saying it's not such a good thing.
69	The picture I showed you before, and this picture, of drought, death and disease
72	is what we usually see.
76	"What we want to look at is ""Africa: the Next Chapter,"""
80	and that's this: a healthy, smiling, beautiful African.
84	And I think it's worth remembering what we've heard
87	through the conference right from the first day,
89	where I heard that all the important statistics have been given --
92	about where we are now,
95	about how the continent is doing much better.
99	And the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on.
102	So I'm not going to spend too much time --
105	just to show you, refresh your memories
108	"that we are here for ""Africa: the Next Chapter"" because for the first time"
110	there really is a platform to build on.
114	We really do have it going right
117	that the continent is growing at rates that people had thought would not happen.
121	After decades of 2 percent, we are now at 5 percent,
124	and it's going to -- projected -- 6 and 7 percent even.
128	And inflation has come down.
132	External debt -- something that I can tell you a long story about
134	because I personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent --
138	has come down dramatically.
141	You know, as you can see,
143	from almost 50 billion down to about 12 or 13 billion.
146	Now this is a huge achievement.
149	You know, we've built up reserves. Why is that important?
153	It's because it shows off our economies, shows off our currencies
156	and gives a platform on which people can plan and build, including businesses.
161	We've also seen some evidence that all this is making a difference
165	because private investment flows have increased.
168	I want to remind you again --
170	I know you saw these statistics before --
173	from almost 6 billion we are now at about 18 billion.
176	In 2005, remittances -- I just took one country, Nigeria
179	skyrocketing -- skyrocketing is too dramatic,
184	but increasing dramatically.
187	And in many other countries this is happening.
189	Why is this important? Because it shows confidence.
191	People are now confident to bring --
194	if your people in the diaspora bring their money back,
197	it shows other people that, look,
199	there is emerging confidence in your country.
202	And instead of an outflow, you are now getting a net inflow.
205	Now, why is all this important, to have to go really fast?
207	It's important that we build this platform,
210	that we have the president, Kikwete, and others of our leaders who are saying,
213	"""Look, we must do something different."""
215	Because we are confronted with a challenge.
224	What does this mean?
227	This means that we have to focus on how our youth
230	are going to be engaged in productive endeavor in their lives.
233	You have to focus on how to create jobs,
236	make sure they don't fall into disease, and that they get an education.
238	But most of all that they are productively engaged in life,
241	and that they are creating the kind of productive environment
244	in our countries that will make things happen.
248	And to support this, I just recently --
251	one of the things I've done since leaving government
253	is to start an opinion research organization in Nigeria.
255	Most of our countries don't even have any opinion research.
259	People don't have voice.
261	There is no way you can know what people want.
263	One of the things we asked them recently was what's their top issue.
265	Like in every other country where this has been done,
268	jobs is the top issue.
272	I want to leave this up here and come back to it.
277	But before I get to this slide, I just wanted to run you through this.
281	And to say that for me, the next stage of building this platform
284	that now enables us to move forward --
287	and we mustn't make light of it.
289	It was only 5, 6, 7 years ago
294	we couldn't even talk about the next chapter, because we were in the old chapter.
298	We were going nowhere.
301	The economies were not growing.
303	We were having negative per capita growth.
307	The microeconomic framework and foundation for moving forward
309	was not even there.
313	So let's not forget that it's taken a lot to build this,
316	including all those things that we tried to do in Nigeria that Dele referred to.
318	Creating our own program to solve problems, like fighting corruption,
325	building institutions, stabilizing the micro economy.
330	So now we have this platform we can build on.
334	And it brings us to the debate that has been going on here:
338	aid versus private sector, aid versus trade, etc.
343	And someone stood up to say that one of the frustrating things
348	is that it's been a simplistic debate.
350	And that's not what the debate should be about.
355	That's engaging in the wrong debate.
359	The issue here is how do we get a partnership that involves government donors,
361	the private sector and ordinary African people
365	taking charge of their own lives?
368	How do we combine all this?
373	To move our continent forward, to do the things that need doing
375	that I talked about -- getting young people employed.
378	Getting the creative juices flowing on this continent,
381	much of what you have seen here.
384	So I'm afraid we've been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate.
387	We need to bring it back to say,
389	what is the combination of all these factors
392	that is going to yield what we want? (Applause)
396	And I want to tell you something.
401	For me, the issue about aid --
404	I don't think that Africans need to now go all the way over to the other side
408	and feel bad about aid.
411	Africa has been giving the other countries aid.
414	Mo Ibrahim said at a debate we were at that
419	he dreams one day when Africa will be giving aid.
421	"And I said, ""Mo, you're right. We have -- no, but we've already been doing it!"
424	"The U.K. and the U.S. could not have been built today without Africa's aid."""
430	(Applause)
438	It is all the resources that were taken from Africa,
441	including human, that built these countries today!
445	So when they try to give back, we shouldn't be on the defensive.
451	The issue is not that.
454	The issue is how are we using what has been given back.
458	How are we using it?
461	Is it being directed effectively?
466	I want to tell you a little story.
469	Why I don't mind if we get aid, but we use it well.
478	From 1967 to '70, Nigeria fought a war -- the Nigeria-Biafra war.
481	And in the middle of that war, I was 14 years old.
485	We spent much of our time with my mother cooking.
487	For the army -- my father joined the army as a brigadier -- the Biafran army.
490	We were on the Biafran side.
492	And we were down to eating one meal a day, running from place to place,
495	but wherever we could help we did.
499	At a certain point in time, in 1969, things were really bad.
503	We were down to almost nothing in terms of a meal a day.
507	People, children were dying of kwashiorkor.
509	I'm sure some of you who are not so young
511	will remember those pictures.
514	Well, I was in the middle of it.
516	In the midst of all this, my mother fell ill with a stomach ailment for two or three days.
520	We thought she was going to die.
522	My father was not there.
524	He was in the army.
525	So I was the oldest person in the house.
529	My sister fell very ill with malaria.
534	She was three years old and I was 15.
539	And she had such a high fever. We tried everything.
541	It didn't look like it was going to work.
545	Until we heard that 10 kilometers away there was a doctor, who was
549	looking at people and giving them meds.
551	Now I put my sister on my back -- burning --
555	and I walked 10 kilometers with her strapped on my back.
558	It was really hot. I was very hungry.
563	I was scared because I knew her life depended on my getting to this woman.
566	We heard there was a woman doctor who was treating people.
568	I walked 10 kilometers, putting one foot in front of the other.
571	I got there and I saw huge crowds.
574	Almost a thousand people were there, trying to break down the door.
577	She was doing this in a church. How was I going to get in?
583	I had to crawl in between the legs of these people
586	with my sister strapped on my back,
590	find a way to a window.
591	And while they were trying to break down the door,
594	I climbed in through the window, and jumped in.
598	This woman told me it was in the nick of time.
601	By the time we jumped into that hall, she was barely moving.
605	She gave a shot of her chloroquine -- what I learned was the chloroquine then --
609	gave her some -- it must have been a re-hydration --
612	and some other therapies, and put us in a corner.
619	In about two to three hours, she started to move.
624	And then they toweled her down because she started sweating,
627	which was a good sign.
632	And then my sister woke up.
636	And about five or six hours later, she said we could go home.
639	I strapped her on my back.
642	I walked the 10 kilometers back and it was the shortest walk I ever had.
646	I was so happy -- (Applause) -- that my sister was alive!
653	Today she's 41 years old, a mother of three,
655	and she's a physician saving other lives.
658	Why am I telling that? I'm telling you that because --
660	when it is you or your person involved --
666	you don't care where -- whether it's aid.
671	You don't care what it is! (Applause)
679	You just want the person to be alive!
684	And now let me become less sentimental, and say that saving lives --
687	which some of the aid we get does on this continent --
690	when you save the life of anyone, a farmer, a teacher, a mother,
693	they are contributing productively into the economy.
695	And as an economist, we can also look at that side of the story.
704	These are people who are productive agents in the economy.
706	So if we save people from HIV/AIDS, if we save them from malaria,
710	it means they can form the base of production for our economy.
713	And by the same token --
717	as someone said yesterday -- if we don't and they die,
719	their children will become a burden on the economy.
721	So even from an economic standpoint,
725	if we leave the social and the humanitarian,
727	we need to save lives now.
730	So that's one of the reasons, from a personal experience, that I say
733	let's channel these resources we get into something productive.
739	However, I will also tell you that I'm one of those
743	who doesn't believe that this is the sole answer.
746	That's why I said the debate has to get more sophisticated.
749	You know, we have to use it well.
755	What has happened in Europe?
759	Do you all know that Spain -- part of the EU --
763	got 10 billion dollars in aid from the rest of the EU?
767	Resources that were transferred to them --
771	and were the Spanish ashamed of this? No!
774	The EU transferred 10 billion. Where did they use it?
776	Have you been to southern Spain lately? There are roads everywhere.
781	Infrastructure everywhere.
784	It is on the back of this that the whole of southern Spain
786	has developed into a services economy.
789	Did you know that Ireland got 3 billion dollars in aid?
791	Ireland is one of the fastest-growing economies in the European Union today.
795	For which many people, even from other parts of the world,
801	are going there to find jobs.
803	What did they do with the 3 billion dollars in aid?
806	They used it to build an information superhighway,
809	gain infrastructure that
813	enables them to participate in the
815	information technology revolution,
817	and to create jobs in their economy.
820	"They didn't say, ""No, you know, we're not going to take this."""
822	Today, the European Union is busy transferring aid.
825	My frustration is if they can build infrastructure in Spain --
827	which is roads, highways, other things that they can build --
831	I say then, why do they refuse to use the same aid
833	to build the same infrastructure in our countries? (Applause)
835	When we ask them and tell them what we need,
846	one of my worries today is that we have many foundations now.
848	Now we talk about the World Bank, IMF, and accountability, all that
851	and the EU.
853	We also have private citizens now who have a lot of money --
858	some of them in this audience, with private foundations.
860	And one day, these foundations have so much money,
863	they will overtake the official aid that is being given.
866	But I fear -- and I'm very grateful to all of them
871	for what they are trying to do on the continent --
873	but I'm also worried. I wake up with a gnawing in my belly
880	because I see a new set of aid entrepreneurs on the continent.
883	And they're also going from country to country,
887	and many times trying to find what to do.
892	But I'm not really sure that their assistance
895	is also being channeled in the right way.
899	And many of them are not really familiar with the continent.
901	They are just discovering.
904	And many times I don't see Africans working with them.
907	They are just going alone! (Applause)
910	And many times I get the impression that they are not really even interested
912	in hearing from Africans who might know.
916	They want to visit us,
919	see what's happening on the ground and make a decision.
921	And now I'm maybe being harsh.
923	But I worry because this money is so important.
926	Now, who are they accountable to?
931	Are we on their boards when they make decisions
933	about where to channel money? Are we there?
936	Will we make the same mistake that we made before?
939	Have our presidents and our leaders -- everyone is talking about --
941	have they ever called these people together and said,
943	"""Look, your foundation and your foundation --"
946	you have so much money, we are grateful.
948	Let's sit down and really tell you where the money should be channeled
951	"and where this aid should go."""
954	Have we done that? The answer is no.
959	And each one is making their own individual effort.
962	And then 10 years from now, billions will again have gone into Africa,
965	and we would still have the same problems.
969	This is what gives us the hopeless image.
972	Our inability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money,
976	"""Sit down."""
978	And we don't do it because there are so many of us. We don't coordinate.
980	We've not called the Bill Gates, and the Soros,
986	and everybody else who is helping and say,
991	"""Sit down. Let's have a conference with you."
994	As a continent, here are our priorities.
997	"Here is where we want you to channel this money."""
1001	Each one should not be an entrepreneur
1003	going out and finding what is best.
1006	We're not trying to stop them at all! But to help them help us better.
1010	And what is disappointing me is that we are not doing this.
1013	Ten years from now we will have the same story,
1015	and we will be repeating the same things.
1020	So our problem right now is, how can we leverage
1025	all this good will that is coming towards our way?
1031	How can we get government to combine properly
1035	with these private foundations, with the international organizations,
1038	and with our private sector.
1041	I firmly believe in that private sector thing too.
1045	But it cannot do it alone.
1047	So there might be a few ideas we could think of that could work.
1050	They said this is about proliferating and sharing ideas.
1053	So why don't we think of using some of this aid?
1058	Well, why don't we first say to those helping us out,
1061	"""Don't be shy about infrastructure."
1063	That health that you're working on cannot be sustainable without infrastructure.
1070	That education will work better
1075	if we've got electricity and railroads, and so on.
1078	That agriculture will work better if there are railroads to get the goods to market.
1081	Don't be shy of it.
1086	"Invest some of your resources in that, too."""
1089	And then we can see that this is one combination
1094	of private, international, multilateral money,
1098	private sector and the African that we can put together as a partnership,
1101	so that aid can be a facilitator.
1106	That is all aid can be.
1109	Aid cannot solve our problems, I'm firmly convinced about that.
1111	But it can be catalytic. And if we fail to use it as catalytic,
1115	we would have failed.
1120	One of the reasons why China is a bit popular with Africans now --
1123	one of the reasons is not only just that, you know, these people are stupid
1128	and China is coming to take resources.
1131	It's because there's a little more leverage in terms of the Chinese.
1137	"If you tell them, ""We need a road here,"""
1142	they will help you build it.
1144	They don't shy away from infrastructure.
1145	In fact, the Chinese minister of finance said to me,
1147	when I asked him what are we doing wrong in Nigeria.
1149	"He said, ""There are two things you need only."
1152	Infrastructure, infrastructure, infrastructure and discipline.
1155	"You are undisciplined."" (Applause)"
1164	And I repeat it for the continent.
1168	It's the same. We need infrastructure, infrastructure and discipline.
1169	So we can make a catalytic to help us provide some of that.
1172	Now I realize -- I'm not saying -- health and education --
1176	no, you can also provide that as well.
1179	But I'm saying it's not either or.
1182	Let's see how aid can be a facilitator in partnership.
1184	One idea.
1187	Second thing, for the private sector,
1190	people are afraid to take risks on the continent.
1194	Why can't some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanisms,
1196	to enable people to take risk?
1200	(Applause)
1201	And finally, because they are both standing at my -- I'm out of time.
1207	Am I out of time?
1210	OK, so let me not forget my punchline.
1213	One of the things I want everybody to collaborate on is
1216	to support women, to create jobs. (Applause)
1225	A lot has been said here about women, I don't need to repeat it.
1227	But there are people -- women -- creating jobs.
1230	And we know, studies have shown
1232	that when you put resources in the hand of the woman --
1235	in fact, there's an econometric study,
1237	the World Bank Review, done in 2000, showing that
1240	transfers into the hands of women result
1243	in healthier children, more for the household, more for the economy and all that.
1248	So I'm saying that one of the takeaways from here --
1251	I'm not saying the men are not important --
1252	obviously, if you leave the husbands out, what will they do?
1255	They'll come back home and get disgruntled,
1257	and it will result in difficulties we don't want.
1261	We don't want men beating their wives
1263	because they don't have a job, and so on.
1266	But at the margin, we also -- I want to push this,
1269	because the reason is the men automatically --
1273	they get -- not automatically, but they tend to get more support.
1278	But I want you to realize that resources
1281	in the hands of African women is a powerful tool.
1285	There are people creating jobs.
1289	Beatrice Gakuba has created 200 jobs from her flower business in Rwanda.
1291	We have Ibukun Awosika in Nigeria, with the chair company.
1296	She wants to expand.
1298	She needs another 20 million.
1300	She will create another 100, 200 more jobs.
1304	So take away from here is how are you going to put together
1308	the resources to put money in the hands of women in the middle
1310	who are ready --
1314	business people who want to expand and create more jobs.
1317	And lastly, what are you going to do
1322	to be part of this partnership of aid, government, private sector
1327	and the African as an individual?
1330	Thank you. (Applause)
