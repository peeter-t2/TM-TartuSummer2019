12.537	My work focuses on the connection of
15.054	both thinking about our community life
18.561	being part of the environment
20.221	where architecture grows from the natural
22.509	local conditions and traditions.
25.981	Today I brought two recent projects
28.13	as an example of this.
30.403	Both projects are in emerging countries,
32.479	one in Ethiopia and another one in Tunisia.
35.518	And also they have in common
37.277	that the different analyses from different perspectives
40.309	becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
44.892	The first example started with an invitation
47.634	to design a multistory shopping mall
49.657	in Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa.
51.962	And this is the type of building
54.257	we were shown as an example, to my team and myself,
57.082	of what we had to design.
59.246	At first, the first thing I thought was,
61.321	I want to run away.
63.271	(Laughter)
65.332	After seeing a few of these buildings --
67.64	there are many in the city --
69.44	we realized that they have three very big points.
72.882	First, these buildings, they are almost empty
74.978	because they have very large shops
76.759	where people cannot afford to buy things.
79.73	Second, they need tons of energy to perform
82.57	because of the skin treatment with glass
84.738	that creates heat in the inside,
86.706	and then you need a lot of cooling.
88.346	In a city where this shouldn't happen
90.307	because they have really mild weather
92.202	that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year.
95.951	And third is that their image has nothing to do
99.141	with Africa and with Ethiopia.
101.296	It is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions.
106.898	Also during our first visit to Ethiopia,
109.718	I was really captivated by the old merkato
111.846	that is this open-air structure
114.027	where thousands of people, they go and buy things
115.919	every day from small vendors.
118.286	And also it has this idea of the public space
120.574	that uses the outdoors to create activity.
123.816	So I thought, this is what I really want to design,
127.182	not a shopping mall.
128.971	But the question was how we could do a multistory,
132.251	contemporary building with these principles.
135.14	The next challenge was when we looked at the site,
137.596	that is, in a really growing area of the city,
140.144	where most of these buildings that you see in the image,
142.628	they were not there.
144.23	And it's also between two parallel streets
146.902	that don't have any connection for hundreds of meters.
149.269	So the first thing we did was to create a connection
152.663	between these two streets,
154.399	putting all the entrances of the building.
156.598	And this extends with an inclined atrium
159.383	that creates an open-air space in the building
161.711	that self-protects itself with its own shape
164.44	from the sun and the rain.
166.242	And around this void
167.898	we placed this idea of the market with small shops,
171.201	that change in each floor because of the shape of the void.
174.971	I also thought, how to close the building?
177.242	And I really wanted to find a solution
179.152	that would respond to the local climate conditions.
182.615	And I started thinking about the textile
184.723	like a shell made of concrete
186.604	with perforations that would let the air in,
190.175	and also the light, but in a filtered way.
192.799	And then the inspiration came from these beautiful 
192.799	patterns of the Ethiopian women's dresses.
198.603	That they have fractal geometry properties
200.778	and this helped me to shape the whole facade.
202.909	And we are building that
204.514	with these small prefabricated pieces
206.655	that are the windows that let the air and the light
210.093	in a controlled way inside the building.
212.075	And this is complemented by these small colored glasses
214.457	that use the light from the inside of the building
217.06	to light up the building at night.
219.946	With these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers
224.068	because they were like,
225.224	"""This is not a shopping mall. We didn't ask for that."""
227.912	But then we all realized that this idea of the market
233.721	happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall
236.495	because basically they had more shops to sell.
239.215	And also that the idea of the facade was much, much cheaper,
243.289	not only because of the material compared with the glass,
245.517	but also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore.
248.205	So we created some budget savings
250.362	that we used to implement the project.
252.259	And the first implementation was to think
254.191	about how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy
257.431	in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day.
260.765	So we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof.
264.982	And then under those panels
267.063	we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars
270.799	that would create this urban oasis.
273.613	And these porches on the roof,
275.403	all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside.
280.139	Hopefully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction.
285.301	The second example is a master plan
288.356	of 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis.
291.635	And for doing such a big project, the biggest project I've ever designed,
295.569	I really needed to understand the city of Tunis,
297.834	but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture.
301.956	During that analysis I paid special attention to the medina
305.064	that is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall,
309.041	opened by twelve different gates, connected by almost straight lines.
313.49	When I went to the site, the first design operation we did
317.859	was to extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks
321.879	similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona
325.063	and other cities in Europe with these courtyards.
328.054	On top of that, we selected some strategic points
330.839	reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines,
334.04	and this modified this initial pattern.
336.81	And the last operation was to think about the cell,
339.26	the small cell of the project, like the apartment,
341.95	as an essential part of the master plan.
343.728	And for that I thought, what would be the best orientation
346.901	in the Mediterranean climate for an apartment?
349.2	And it's north-south, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house
353.963	and then a natural ventilation.
356.826	So we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments
360.412	are perfectly oriented in that direction.
362.552	And this is the result
364.012	that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
367.777	It has these blocks with courtyards,
369.375	and then on the ground floor
370.498	you have all these connections for the pedestrians.
372.634	And also it responds to the local regulations that establish
375.741	a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor.
379.404	And it also reinforces this idea of the gates.
382.95	The volume has this connecting shape
384.842	that shades itself with three different types of apartments
388.144	and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood
391.787	And in the courtyards there are the different facilities,
394.687	such as a gym and a kindergarten
396.417	and close by, a series of commercial [spaces] that bring activity to the ground floor.
400.487	The roof, which is my favorite space of the project
403.287	is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction.
406.997	And it's where all the neighbors, they can go up and socialize,
409.281	and do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning,
412.818	jumping from one building to another.
416.202	These two examples,
418.561	they have a common approach in the design process.
421.945	And also, they are in emerging countries where you can see
424.524	the cities literally growing.
426.67	In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow
431.411	changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow.
436.552	For this reason, I see even more importance
439.16	to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions
444.19	that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment
448.251	and that aim to connect nature and people.
452.169	Thank you very much.
454.067	(Applause)
