12	I grew up in a very small country town
14.463	in Victoria.
15.763	I had a very normal, low-key kind of upbringing.
20.18	I went to school, I hung out with my friends,
23.58	I fought with my younger sisters.
25.966	It was all very normal.
27.755	And when I was 15, a member of my local community
31.927	approached my parents
33.347	and wanted to nominate me
34.74	for a community achievement award.
37.86	"And my parents said, ""Hm, that's really nice,"
41.103	but there's kind of one glaring problem with that.
44.32	"She hasn't actually achieved anything."" (Laughter)"
49.254	And they were right, you know.
50.849	I went to school, I got good marks,
53.835	I had a very low-key after school job
56.283	in my mum's hairdressing salon,
58.065	and I spent a lot of time watching
59.863	"""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Dawson's Creek."""
62.994	Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.
67.037	But they were right, you know.
68.377	I wasn't doing anything that was out of the ordinary
70.93	at all.
72.611	I wasn't doing anything that could
72.611	be considered an achievement
75.554	if you took disability out of the equation.
79.156	Years later, I was on my second teaching round
83.022	in a Melbourne high school,
84.758	and I was about 20 minutes into
84.758	a year 11 legal studies class
89.709	when this boy put up his hand and said,
91.488	"""Hey miss, when are you going"
91.488	"to start doing your speech?"""
95.732	"And I said, ""What speech?"""
97.709	You know, I'd been talking them
99.013	about defamation law for a good 20 minutes.
101.909	"And he said, ""You know, like,"
103.58	your motivational speaking.
105.9	You know, when people in
105.9	wheelchairs come to school,
107.89	"they usually say, like, inspirational stuff?"""
112.813	(Laughter)
114.259	"""It's usually in the big hall."""
118.557	And that's when it dawned on me:
120.77	This kid had only ever experienced disabled people
124.041	as objects of inspiration.
127.699	We are not, to this kid --
129.56	and it's not his fault, I mean,
130.861	that's true for many of us.
132.672	For lots of us, disabled people are not our teachers
136.418	or our doctors or our manicurists.
139.477	We're not real people. We are there to inspire.
144.846	And in fact, I am sitting on this stage
148.352	looking like I do in this wheelchair,
151.434	and you are probably kind of expecting me
154.367	to inspire you. Right? (Laughter)
159.147	Yeah.
161.99	Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid
164.004	I'm going to disappoint you dramatically.
166.861	I am not here to inspire you.
169.03	I am here to tell you that we have been lied to
171.607	about disability.
173.574	Yeah, we've been sold the lie
175.681	that disability is a Bad Thing, capital B, capital T.
180.886	It's a bad thing, and to live with a disability
183.827	makes you exceptional.
185.973	It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't
188.888	make you exceptional.
191.517	And in the past few years, we've been able
193.252	to propagate this lie even further
195.875	via social media.
198.149	You may have seen images like this one:
200.382	"""The only disability in life is a bad attitude."""
204.975	"Or this one: ""Your excuse is invalid."" Indeed."
209.326	"Or this one: ""Before you quit, try!"""
215.686	These are just a couple of examples,
217.342	but there are a lot of these images out there.
219.311	You know, you might have seen the one,
220.94	the little girl with no hands
222.689	drawing a picture with a pencil held in her mouth.
226.4	You might have seen a child running
228.12	on carbon fiber prosthetic legs.
230.993	And these images,
232.344	there are lots of them out there,
233.97	they are what we call inspiration porn.
237.884	(Laughter)
240.11	And I use the term porn deliberately,
242.328	because they objectify one group of people
245.477	for the benefit of another group of people.
248.288	So in this case, we're objectifying disabled people
251.167	for the benefit of nondisabled people.
253.824	The purpose of these images
255.952	is to inspire you, to motivate you,
259.763	so that we can look at them
261.838	"and think, ""Well, however bad my life is,"
264.927	it could be worse.
266.958	"I could be that person."""
270.286	But what if you are that person?
273.662	I've lost count of the number of times that I've
275.75	been approached by strangers
278.218	wanting to tell me that they think I'm brave
281.123	or inspirational,
282.88	and this was long before my work
284.539	had any kind of public profile.
286.593	They were just kind of congratulating me
288.295	for managing to get up in the morning
290.001	and remember my own name. (Laughter)
294.009	And it is objectifying.
296.547	These images, those images
298.64	objectify disabled people
300.571	for the benefit of nondisabled people.
303.496	They are there so that you can look at them
306.11	and think that things aren't so bad for you,
308.813	to put your worries into perspective.
312.96	And life as a disabled person
315.881	is actually somewhat difficult.
317.965	We do overcome some things.
320.071	But the things that we're overcoming
322.283	are not the things that you think they are.
324.9	They are not things to do with our bodies.
327.507	"I use the term ""disabled people"" quite deliberately,"
329.885	because I subscribe to what's called
329.885	the social model of disability,
334.083	which tells us that we are more disabled
336.381	by the society that we live in
340.295	than by our bodies and our diagnoses.
343.178	So I have lived in this body a long time.
347.086	I'm quite fond of it.
349.349	It does the things that I need it to do,
352.402	and I've learned to use it to the best of its capacity
355.695	just as you have,
356.829	and that's the thing about those
356.829	kids in those pictures as well.
359.853	They're not doing anything out of the ordinary.
363.132	They are just using their bodies
365.481	to the best of their capacity.
367.79	So is it really fair to objectify them
371.293	in the way that we do,
373.016	to share those images?
375.118	"People, when they say, ""You're an inspiration,"""
379.641	they mean it as a compliment.
382.926	And I know why it happens.
384.292	It's because of the lie, it's because we've been sold
386.564	this lie that disability makes you exceptional.
390.778	And it honestly doesn't.
392.612	And I know what you're thinking.
393.971	You know, I'm up here bagging out inspiration,
396.72	"and you're thinking, ""Jeez, Stella,"
398.639	"aren't you inspired sometimes by some things?"""
402.756	And the thing is, I am.
404.85	I learn from other disabled people all the time.
407.888	I'm learning not that I am luckier than them, though.
412.827	I am learning that it's a genius idea
415.982	to use a pair of barbecue tongs
417.403	to pick up things that you dropped. (Laughter)
423.16	I'm learning that nifty trick where you can charge
425.681	your mobile phone battery from your chair battery.
430.266	Genius.
431.48	We are learning from each
431.48	others' strength and endurance,
434.061	not against our bodies and our diagnoses,
436.702	but against a world that exceptionalizes
439.506	and objectifies us.
441.963	I really think that this lie that we've been sold
444.598	about disability is the greatest injustice.
448.821	It makes life hard for us.
452.956	"And that quote, ""The only disability in life"
456.829	"is a bad attitude,"""
458.827	the reason that that's bullshit
461.954	is because it's just not true,
463.575	because of the social model of disability.
466.237	No amount of smiling at a flight of stairs
470.402	has ever made it turn into a ramp.
475.348	Never. (Laughter) (Applause)
481.93	Smiling at a television screen
483.81	isn't going to make closed captions appear
485.641	for people who are deaf.
487.374	No amount of standing
487.374	in the middle of a bookshop
489.836	and radiating a positive attitude
491.606	is going to turn all those books into braille.
494.305	It's just not going to happen.
498.509	I really want to live in a world
501.236	where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
504.9	I want to live in a world where a 15-year-old girl
507.096	sitting in her bedroom
508.83	"watching ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"""
511.007	isn't referred to as achieving anything
513.545	because she's doing it sitting down.
515.811	I want to live in a world
517.236	where we don't have such low expectations
520.361	of disabled people
521.91	that we are congratulated for getting out of bed
524.236	and remembering our own names in the morning.
527.033	I want to live in a world where
527.033	we value genuine achievement
530.454	for disabled people,
532.217	and I want to live in a world
533.824	where a kid in year 11 in a Melbourne high school
537.236	is not one bit surprised
539.589	that his new teacher is a wheelchair user.
542.747	Disability doesn't make you exceptional,
545.79	but questioning what you
545.79	think you know about it does.
549.243	Thank you.
550.51	(Applause)
