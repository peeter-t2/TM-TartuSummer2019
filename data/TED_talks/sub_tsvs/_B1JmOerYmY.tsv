12.605	I have a confession.
16.858	I have been in an affair
19.329	since I was 17 years old.
22.704	I wish I could talk about
22.704	butterflies in my stomach
26.575	or maps I drew on the ground
29.438	when I think about this affair,
31.747	but I cannot.
33.896	I wish I could talk about
33.896	sweet words spoken
37.18	or gifts that I received
39.277	from this affair,
41.021	but I cannot.
43.738	All I can tell you about is the aftermath,
47.742	about days I spent constantly asking:
51.518	Why, why, why me?
57.24	I remember how it all began.
60.088	I was in my final year of high school,
62.899	and my class had just won in sports,
66.046	so we were singing and dancing
66.046	and hugging each other.
70.789	I went and took a shower.
72.597	Then I went for dinner.
75.061	And when I sat down to eat,
77.335	my teeth started chattering,
79.909	and so I couldn't put
79.909	the spoon in my mouth.
82.468	I rushed to the nurse's office,
85.046	and because I couldn't talk,
85.046	I just pointed at my mouth.
88.984	She didn't know what was happening,
90.794	so she told me to lie down,
92.902	and it worked --
94.198	after a few minutes,
94.198	the chattering stopped.
96.685	I was about to dash out,
96.685	and she told me --
101.137	no, she insisted -- that I go up
101.137	to the dormitories to sleep.
106.085	Here I was in my final year
106.085	of high school,
109.226	just a few months from doing
109.226	my end of high school exams
113.805	and a few days from doing a set
113.805	"of exams we call here in Kenya ""mocks,"""
118.718	which are somehow meant to gauge
118.718	how prepared one is for the final exams.
124.423	There is no way I was going to sleep
126.739	and let a set of exams mock me.
129.207	I went to class, sat down,
132.234	took my Kenyan history notes,
134.613	and there I was, down Kenyan coastal town,
138.402	with the great Mekatilili wa Menza,
140.909	the Giriama woman who led her people
140.909	against British colonial rule.
147.319	Then, without any notice,
150.259	my left hand started jerking,
154.375	and it was as if I was marking
154.375	imaginary papers.
157.893	In and out it went,
160.953	and with every stroke, one by one,
164.172	my classmates stopped
164.172	concentrating on their reading
167.679	and started looking at me.
170.376	And I tried really hard to stop it,
173.071	but I couldn't,
174.751	because it had a life of its own.
178.107	And then, when it was sure
178.107	everybody was looking at us,
182.753	in its final show
182.753	and official introduction,
186.967	I had my first full-blown seizure,
189.8	which was the beginning of what
189.8	has been a 15-year-long affair.
197.361	Seizures are the trademark characteristic
197.361	for most types of epilepsy,
203.94	and every first-ever seizure
203.94	needs to be assessed by a doctor
208.442	to determine if one has epilepsy
210.969	or if it's a symptom of something else.
213.679	In my case, it was confirmed
213.679	that I had epilepsy.
218.091	I spent a large chunk of my time
218.091	in hospital and at home,
223.01	and only went back to do my final exams.
227.255	I had seizures in between papers,
231.128	but managed to get good enough grades
233.288	to be admitted for an actuarial
233.288	science degree
236.572	at the University of Nairobi.
238.187	(Applause)
244.53	Unfortunately, I had to drop out
244.53	in my second year.
249.117	I didn't have good enough coping skills
251.584	and a support community around me.
254.315	I was lucky enough to get a job,
257.05	but I was fired from that job
257.05	when I had a seizure in the workplace.
262.521	So I found myself in a space
266.669	where I was constantly asking myself
270.125	why this had to happen to me.
273.548	I lived in denial for a long time,
277.264	and the denial was maybe because
277.264	of the things that had happened,
284.149	dropping out of school
284.149	and being fired from my job.
287.523	Or maybe it was because of the things
287.523	I had heard about epilepsy
291.562	and about people living with epilepsy:
294.171	that they would never live on their own;
296.427	that they would never travel on their own
298.692	or even get work;
301.191	that they were outcasts,
303.064	with a spirit in them that they needed
303.064	to be delivered from.
308.482	And so the more I thought
308.482	about these things,
312.133	the more my seizures became,
315.834	and I spent days with my legs locked,
318.963	my speech became blurred
322.408	and on days on end, this is how I'd be.
326.867	Two or three days after a seizure,
328.924	my head and my hand
328.924	would still be twitching.
334.079	I felt lost,
336.5	like I'd lost everything,
339.353	and sometimes,
342.596	even the will to live.
353.544	(Sigh)
360.377	I had so much frustration in me.
363.821	And so I started writing,
365.392	because the people around me
365.392	didn't have answers
368.255	to the questions that I had.
370.929	And so I wrote my fears
373.655	and my doubts.
375.749	I wrote about my good days
375.749	and my bad days and my really ugly days,
380.04	and I shared them on a blog.
382.898	And before long,
385.308	I began to be seen and heard
385.308	by people who had epilepsy
388.963	and their families,
390.421	and even those who did not
390.421	have the diagnosis.
393.773	And I moved from that girl
393.773	who constantly asked why me
397.887	to one who not only self-advocates,
400.698	but does it for those who are yet
400.698	to find their voices.
407.197	(Applause)
414.901	My seizures are greatly reduced,
414.901	from two to three times a day,
418.869	to sometimes two to three
418.869	times in one year.
422.3	I went on --
423.534	(Applause)
429.299	I went on to employ five people,
431.927	when I began what was Kenya's first
434.212	free mental health
434.212	and epilepsy support line.
437.682	And I travel --
439.028	(Applause)
441.349	And I travel to speak about my affair,
445.871	all these things that I had been told
448.252	people like me living with epilepsy
448.252	could never be able to do.
453.11	Every year, a population
453.11	as big as 80 percent of Nairobi
458.35	gets diagnosed with epilepsy
461.139	across the globe.
463.166	And they, like me,
464.349	go through the emotions
464.349	of stigma and exclusion.
470.422	And so I have made it my life journey
473.922	to keep these conversations going,
476.53	and I keep confessing about my affair
479.729	so that those people who do not
479.729	have the diagnosis
483.107	might know and might have
483.107	a constant reminder
487.068	that it is alright to engage
487.068	with people like us,
490.272	that as long as they pull down
490.272	the walls of stigma and exclusion,
495.856	that we, just like them,
498.097	can be able to take anything
498.097	life throws at us.
501.801	Thank you.
503.008	(Applause)
