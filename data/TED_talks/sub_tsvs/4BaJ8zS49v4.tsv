12.106	So the machine I'm going to talk you about
13.53	is what I call the greatest machine that never was.
15.204	It was a machine that was never built,
17.203	and yet, it will be built.
19.583	It was a machine that was designed
21.575	long before anyone thought about computers.
23.926	If you know anything about the history of computers,
26.075	you will know that in the '30s and the '40s,
28.595	simple computers were created
31.15	that started the computer revolution we have today,
33.943	and you would be correct,
35.229	except for you'd have the wrong century.
37.711	The first computer was really designed
39.351	in the 1830s and 1840s, not the 1930s and 1940s.
43.023	It was designed, and parts of it were prototyped,
45.351	and the bits of it that were built are here
47.487	in South Kensington.
49.48	That machine was built by this guy, Charles Babbage.
52.799	Now, I have a great affinity for Charles Babbage
54.555	because his hair is always completely unkempt like this
57.164	in every single picture. (Laughter)
59.505	He was a very wealthy man, and a sort of,
61.352	part of the aristocracy of Britain,
63.365	and on a Saturday night in Marylebone,
65.704	were you part of the intelligentsia of that period,
68.135	you would have been invited round to his house
69.631	for a soiree — and he invited everybody:
72.59	kings, the Duke of Wellington, many, many famous people —
76.022	and he would have shown you one of his mechanical machines.
78.543	I really miss that era, you know, where you could
81.583	go around for a soiree and see a mechanical computer
83.931	get demonstrated to you. (Laughter)
85.044	But Babbage, Babbage himself was born
88.31	at the end of the 18th century,
90.044	and was a fairly famous mathematician.
92.088	He held the post that Newton held at Cambridge,
95.231	and that was recently held by Stephen Hawking.
97.743	He's less well known than either of them because
100.598	he got this idea to make mechanical computing devices
103.748	and never made any of them.
106.033	The reason he never made any of them, he's a classic nerd.
109.318	Every time he had a good idea, he'd think,
111.329	"""That's brilliant, I'm going to start building that one."
112.777	I'll spend a fortune on it. I've got a better idea.
115.372	"I'm going to work on this one. (Laughter) And I'm going to do this one."""
117.732	He did this until Sir Robert Peel, then Prime Minister,
120.612	basically kicked him out of Number 10 Downing Street,
123.076	and kicking him out, in those days, that meant saying,
125.517	"""I bid you good day, sir."" (Laughter)"
128.669	The thing he designed was this monstrosity here,
130.649	the analytical engine. Now, just to give you an idea of this,
134.088	this is a view from above.
135.96	Every one of these circles is a cog, a stack of cogs,
139.073	and this thing is as big as a steam locomotive.
142.309	So as I go through this talk, I want you to imagine
144.3	this gigantic machine. We heard those wonderful sounds
146.944	of what this thing would have sounded like.
148.704	And I'm going to take you through the architecture of the machine
150.481	— that's why it's computer architecture —
151.96	and tell you about this machine, which is a computer.
155.287	So let's talk about the memory. The memory
158.69	is very like the memory of a computer today,
160.937	except it was all made out of metal,
163.639	stacks and stacks of cogs, 30 cogs high.
167.183	Imagine a thing this high of cogs,
169.253	hundreds and hundreds of them,
171.008	and they've got numbers on them.
172.898	It's a decimal machine. Everything's done in decimal.
175.317	And he thought about using binary. The problem
176.902	with using binary is that the machine would have been so
178.62	tall, it would have been ridiculous. As it is, it's enormous.
181.937	So he's got memory.
183.996	The memory is this bit over here.
186.403	You see it all like this.
188.733	This monstrosity over here is the CPU, the chip, if you like.
193.268	Of course, it's this big.
195.518	Completely mechanical. This whole machine is mechanical.
198.431	This is a picture of a prototype for part of the CPU
202.572	which is in the Science Museum.
204.711	The CPU could do the four fundamental functions of arithmetic --
208.343	so addition, multiplication, subtraction, division --
210.796	which already is a bit of a feat in metal,
213.804	but it could also do something that a computer does
216.433	and a calculator doesn't:
218.132	this machine could look at its own internal memory and make a decision.
222.07	"It could do the ""if then"" for basic programmers,"
224.936	and that fundamentally made it into a computer.
227.076	It could compute. It couldn't just calculate. It could do more.
231.674	Now, if we look at this, and we stop for a minute,
234.355	and we think about chips today, we can't
236.226	look inside a silicon chip. It's just so tiny.
240.041	Yet if you did, you would see something
241.842	very, very similar to this.
243.664	There's this incredible complexity in the CPU,
246.611	and this incredible regularity in the memory.
249.303	If you've ever seen an electron microscope picture,
250.965	you'll see this. This all looks the same,
252.934	then there's this bit over here which is incredibly complicated.
255.5	All this cog wheel mechanism here is doing is what a computer does,
259.483	but of course you need to program this thing, and of course,
261.576	Babbage used the technology of the day
264.601	and the technology that would reappear in the '50s, '60s and '70s,
268.247	which is punch cards. This thing over here
271.116	is one of three punch card readers in here,
273.94	and this is a program in the Science Museum, just
277.62	not far from here, created by Charles Babbage,
282.013	that is sitting there — you can go see it —
283.881	waiting for the machine to be built.
286.322	And there's not just one of these, there's many of them.
289.742	He prepared programs anticipating this would happen.
292.832	Now, the reason they used punch cards was that Jacquard,
294.805	in France, had created the Jacquard loom,
296.977	which was weaving these incredible patterns controlled by punch cards,
299.655	so he was just repurposing the technology of the day,
302.287	and like everything else he did, he's using the technology
304.392	of his era, so 1830s, 1840s, 1850s, cogs, steam,
309.139	mechanical devices. Ironically, born the same year
313.077	as Charles Babbage was Michael Faraday,
315.249	who would completely revolutionize everything
317.926	with the dynamo, transformers, all these sorts of things.
320.439	Babbage, of course, wanted to use proven technology,
323.597	so steam and things.
325.15	Now, he needed accessories.
326.823	Obviously, you've got a computer now.
328.495	You've got punch cards, a CPU and memory.
330.884	You need accessories you're going to come with.
332.819	You're not just going to have that,
334.447	So, first of all, you had sound. You had a bell,
337.275	so if anything went wrong — (Laughter) —
339.429	or the machine needed the attendant to come to it,
341.774	there was a bell it could ring. (Laughter)
343.744	And there's actually an instruction on the punch card
345.28	"which says ""Ring the bell."" So you can imagine this ""Ting!"""
348.182	You know, just stop for a moment, imagine all those noises,
350.382	"this thing, ""Click, clack click click click,"""
351.463	"steam engine, ""Ding,"" right? (Laughter)"
354.4	You also need a printer, obviously, and everyone needs a printer.
356.835	This is actually a picture of the printing mechanism for
359.843	another machine of his, called the Difference Engine No. 2,
362.326	which he never built, but which the Science Museum
364.261	did build in the '80s and '90s.
366.432	It's completely mechanical, again, a printer.
368.707	It prints just numbers, because he was obsessed with numbers,
371.405	but it does print onto paper, and it even does word wrapping,
374.922	so if you get to the end of the line, it goes around like that.
377.694	You also need graphics, right?
379.344	I mean, if you're going to do anything with graphics,
380.9	"so he said, ""Well, I need a plotter. I've got a big piece of paper"
383.496	"and an ink pen and I'll make it plot."""
385.604	So he designed a plotter as well,
387.434	and, you know, at that point, I think he got pretty much
391.359	a pretty good machine.
392.89	Along comes this woman, Ada Lovelace.
395.58	Now, imagine these soirees, all these great and good comes along.
398.301	This lady is the daughter of the mad, bad
401.393	and dangerous-to-know Lord Byron,
403.815	and her mother, being a bit worried that she might have
406.335	inherited some of Lord Byron's madness and badness,
409.192	"thought, ""I know the solution: Mathematics is the solution."
412.43	"We'll teach her mathematics. That'll calm her down."""
415.379	(Laughter) Because of course,
419.135	there's never been a mathematician that's gone crazy,
423.05	so, you know, that'll be fine. (Laughter)
425.451	Everything'll be fine. So she's got this mathematical training,
428.789	and she goes to one of these soirees with her mother,
431.527	and Charles Babbage, you know, gets out his machine.
434.317	The Duke of Wellington is there, you know,
436.151	get out the machine, obviously demonstrates it,
437.723	and she gets it. She's the only person in his lifetime, really,
441.474	"who said, ""I understand what this does,"
442.766	"and I understand the future of this machine."""
444.973	And we owe to her an enormous amount because we know
448.06	a lot about the machine that Babbage was intending to build
451.037	because of her.
452.64	Now, some people call her the first programmer.
455.397	This is actually from one of -- the paper that she translated.
458.783	This is a program written in a particular style.
461.694	It's not, historically, totally accurate that she's the first programmer,
465.263	and actually, she did something more amazing.
467.316	Rather than just being a programmer,
468.886	she saw something that Babbage didn't.
471.058	Babbage was totally obsessed with mathematics.
474.242	He was building a machine to do mathematics,
478.191	"and Lovelace said, ""You could do more than mathematics"
481.45	"on this machine."" And just as you do,"
484.285	everyone in this room already's got a computer on them
485.91	right now, because they've got a phone.
487.964	If you go into that phone, every single thing in that phone
490.192	or computer or any other computing device
492.207	is mathematics. It's all numbers at the bottom.
494.288	Whether it's video or text or music or voice, it's all numbers,
498.981	it's all, underlying it, mathematical functions happening,
502.961	"and Lovelace said, ""Just because you're doing"
505.066	mathematical functions and symbols
508.388	doesn't mean these things can't represent
510.635	"other things in the real world, such as music."""
513.988	This was a huge leap, because Babbage is there saying,
516.722	"""We could compute these amazing functions and print out"
518.944	"tables of numbers and draw graphs,"" — (Laughter) —"
522.612	"and Lovelace is there and she says, ""Look,"
524.508	this thing could even compose music if you
526.984	"told it a representation of music numerically."""
530.532	So this is what I call Lovelace's Leap.
532.101	When you say she's a programmer, she did do some,
535.838	but the real thing is to have said the future is going to be
538.975	much, much more than this.
541.171	Now, a hundred years later, this guy comes along,
543.35	Alan Turing, and in 1936, and invents the computer all over again.
548.803	Now, of course, Babbage's machine was entirely mechanical.
551.38	Turing's machine was entirely theoretical.
553.911	Both of these guys were coming from a mathematical perspective,
556.702	but Turing told us something very important.
559.255	He laid down the mathematical foundations
562.19	for computer science, and said,
564.303	"""It doesn't matter how you make a computer."""
567.49	It doesn't matter if your computer's mechanical,
569.368	like Babbage's was, or electronic, like computers are today,
573.778	or perhaps in the future, cells, or, again,
576.582	mechanical again, once we get into nanotechnology.
579.728	We could go back to Babbage's machine
581.765	and just make it tiny. All those things are computers.
584.341	There is in a sense a computing essence.
585.973	This is called the Church–Turing thesis.
587.978	And so suddenly, you get this link where you say
590.645	this thing Babbage had built really was a computer.
592.868	In fact, it was capable of doing everything we do today
595.693	with computers, only really slowly. (Laughter)
600.525	To give you an idea of how slowly,
602.631	it had about 1k of memory.
606.47	It used punch cards, which were being fed in,
609.388	and it ran about 10,000 times slower the first ZX81.
615.148	It did have a RAM pack.
616.751	You could add on a lot of extra memory if you wanted to.
619.93	(Laughter) So, where does that bring us today?
622.256	So there are plans.
623.864	Over in Swindon, the Science Museum archives,
626.797	there are hundreds of plans and thousands of pages
628.491	of notes written by Charles Babbage about this analytical engine.
631.96	One of those is a set of plans that we call Plan 28,
635.921	and that is also the name of a charity that I started
638.075	with Doron Swade, who was the curator of computing
640.809	at the Science Museum, and also the person who drove
643.048	the project to build a difference engine,
644.478	and our plan is to build it.
647.036	Here in South Kensington, we will build the analytical engine.
650.902	The project has a number of parts to it.
652.904	One was the scanning of Babbage's archive.
655.424	That's been done. The second is now the study
657.346	of all of those plans to determine what to build.
660.456	The third part is a computer simulation of that machine,
664.9	and the last part is to physically build it at the Science Museum.
667.823	When it's built, you'll finally be able to understand how a computer works,
670.399	because rather than having a tiny chip in front of you,
672.233	"you've got to look at this humongous thing and say, ""Ah,"
674.843	I see the memory operating, I see the CPU operating,
678.178	"I hear it operating. I probably smell it operating."" (Laughter)"
682.045	But in between that we're going to do a simulation.
684.644	Babbage himself wrote, he said,
686.401	as soon as the analytical engine exists,
688.019	it will surely guide the future course of science.
691.723	Of course, he never built it, because he was always fiddling
693.568	with new plans, but when it did get built, of course,
695.65	in the 1940s, everything changed.
699.16	Now, I'll just give you a little taste of what it looks like
700.983	in motion with a video which shows
703.616	just one part of the CPU mechanism working.
711.21	So this is just three sets of cogs,
714.209	and it's going to add. This is the adding mechanism
717.031	in action, so you imagine this gigantic machine.
719.688	So, give me five years.
720.847	Before the 2030s happen, we'll have it.
723.191	Thank you very much. (Applause)
