12.345	I am an engineering professor,
14.009	and for the past 14 years
17.125	I've been teaching crap.
18.933	(Laughter)
20.238	Not that I'm a bad teacher,
22.255	but I've been studying and teaching
24.373	about human waste
26.26	and how waste is conveyed
27.891	through these wastewater treatment plants,
30.774	and how we engineer and design
32.349	these treatment plants so that we can protect
34.339	surface water like rivers.
36.421	I've based my scientific career
39.071	on using leading-edge molecular techniques,
42.508	DNA- and RNA-based methods
45.12	to look at microbial populations in biological reactors,
48.559	and again to optimize these systems.
50.922	And over the years,
52.171	I have developed an unhealthy obsession with toilets,
56.423	and I've been known to sneak into toilets
59.415	and take my camera phone
61.218	all over the world.
63.566	But along the way, I've learned
65.79	that it's not just the technical side,
68.332	but there's also this thing called the culture of crap.
72.51	So for example,
73.979	how many of you are washers
76.286	and how many of you are wipers?
78.738	(Laughter)
82.945	If, well, I guess you know what I mean.
86.882	If you're a washer, then you use water
89.121	for anal cleansing. That's the technical term.
91.933	And if you're a wiper,
94.791	then you use toilet paper
96.883	or, in some regions of the world
98.638	where it's not available, newspaper
102.272	or rags or corncobs.
105.792	And this is not just a piece of trivia,
108.29	but it's really important to understand
110.146	and solve the sanitation problem.
112.339	And it is a big problem:
114.623	There are 2.5 billion people in the world
116.668	who don't have access to adequate sanitation.
119.829	For them, there's no modern toilet.
121.932	And there are 1.1 billion people
125.843	whose toilets are the streets
128.237	or river banks or open spaces,
131.163	and again, the technical term for that is
133.142	open defecation,
135.179	but that is really simply
138.283	shitting in the open.
140.342	And if you're living in fecal material
142.245	and it's surrounding you, you're going to get sick.
144.58	It's going to get into your drinking water,
146.086	into your food, into your immediate surroundings.
148.502	So the United Nations estimates
150.947	that every year, there are 
150.947	1.5 million child deaths
155.059	because of inadequate sanitation.
157.768	That's one preventable death every 20 seconds,
164.427	4,100 every day.
167.645	And so, to avoid open defecation,
169.737	municipalities and cities
171.912	build infrastructure, for example, like pit latrines,
176.104	in peri-urban and rural areas.
178.026	For example, in KwaZulu-Natal 
178.026	province in South Africa,
181.333	they've built tens of thousands of these pit latrines.
184.667	But there's a problem when you scale up
186.86	to tens of thousands, and the problem is,
189.11	what happens when the pits are full?
190.912	This is what happens.
193.497	People defecate around the toilet.
195.871	In schools, children defecate on the floors
198.976	and then leave a trail outside the building
201.147	and start defecating around the building,
203.93	and these pits have to be cleaned
206.164	and manually emptied.
208.695	And who does the emptying?
210.043	You've got these workers
212.565	who have to sometimes go down into the pits
215.299	and manually remove the contents.
217.7	It's a dirty and dangerous business.
221.547	As you can see, there's no protective equipment,
223.865	no protective clothing.
225.454	There's one worker down there.
226.46	I hope you can see him.
228.098	He's got a face mask on, but no shirt.
230.954	And in some countries, like India,
233.385	the lower castes are condemned
235.859	to empty the pits,
238.233	and they're further condemned by society.
240.809	So you ask yourself, how can we solve this
243.756	and why don't we just build Western-style flush toilets
246.591	for these two and a half billion?
249.112	And the answer is, it's just not possible.
251.417	In some of these areas, there's not enough water,
254.275	there's no energy,
255.648	it's going to cost tens of trillions of dollars
257.683	to lay out the sewer lines
259.258	and to build the facilities
260.129	and to operate and maintain these systems,
262.523	and if you don't build it right,
264.095	you're going to have flush toilets
265.996	that basically go straight into the river,
268.404	just like what's happening in many cities
270.879	in the developing world.
272.272	And is this really the solution?
274.321	Because essentially, what you're doing is
276.211	you're using clean water
278.596	and you're using it to flush your toilet,
280.661	convey it to a wastewater treatment plant
283.147	which then discharges to a river,
284.891	and that river, again, is a drinking water source.
287.647	So we've got to rethink sanitation,
289.942	and we've got to reinvent the sanitation infrastructure,
294.507	and I'm going to argue that to do this,
296.408	you have to employ systems thinking.
298.725	We have to look at the whole sanitation chain.
301.695	We start with a human interface,
303.968	and then we have to think about how feces
305.869	are collected and stored,
308.253	transported, treated and reused â€”
310.975	and not just disposal but reuse.
313.14	So let's start with the human user interface.
315.633	I say, it doesn't matter if you're a washer or a wiper,
319.457	a sitter or a squatter,
321.46	the human user interface should be clean
323.552	and easy to use, because after all,
326.353	taking a dump should be pleasurable.
328.727	(Laughter)
331.348	And when we open the possibilities
334.205	to understanding this sanitation chain,
336.916	then the back-end technology,
338.986	the collection to the reuse, should not really matter,
342.676	and then we can apply
343.969	locally adoptable and context-sensitive solutions.
347.806	So we can open ourselves to possibilities like,
350.506	for example, this urine-diverting toilet,
353.401	and there's two holes in this toilet.
355.233	There's the front and the back,
356.415	and the front collects the urine,
358.489	and the back collects the fecal material.
360.393	And so what you're doing is
360.393	you're separating the urine,
362.239	which has 80 percent of the nitrogen
364.308	and 50 percent of the phosphorus,
366.558	and then that can then be treated
368.639	and precipitated to form things like struvite,
371.26	which is a high-value fertilizer,
373.229	and then the fecal material can then be disinfected
375.727	and again converted to high-value end products.
379.416	Or, for example, in some of our research,
381.621	you can reuse the water by treating it
384.264	in on-site sanitation systems
386.402	like planter boxes or constructed wetlands.
389.163	So we can open up all these possibilities
391.846	if we take away the old paradigm of flush toilets
395.334	and treatment plants.
397	So you might be asking, who's going to pay?
400.418	Well, I'm going to argue that governments
402.376	should fund sanitation infrastructure.
405.807	NGOs and donor organizations,
408.338	they can do their best, but it's not going to be enough.
411.758	Governments should fund sanitation
413.423	the same way they fund roads
415.178	and schools and hospitals
418.638	and other infrastructure like bridges,
420.79	because we know, and the WHO has done this study,
423.893	that for every dollar that we invest
425.727	in sanitation infrastructure,
427.616	we get something like three to 34 dollars back.
431.126	Let's go back to the problem of pit emptying.
433.578	So at North Carolina State University,
435.073	we challenged our students to
435.073	come up with a simple solution,
438.26	and this is what they came up with:
439.744	a simple, modified screw auger
442.387	that can move the waste up
444.321	from the pit and into a collecting drum,
446.84	and now the pit worker
448.336	doesn't have to go down into the pit.
450.441	We tested it in South Africa, and it works.
452.347	We need to make it more robust,
454.075	and we're going to do more testing
455.368	in Malawi and South Africa this coming year.
457.934	And our idea is to make this
459.553	a professionalized pit-emptying service
462.06	so that we can create a small business out of it,
464.638	create profits and jobs,
466.471	and the hope is that,
467.855	as we are rethinking sanitation,
469.646	we are extending the life of these pits
473.024	so that we don't have to resort
475.172	to quick solutions
476.977	that don't really make sense.
478.941	I believe that access to adequate sanitation
482.569	is a basic human right.
484.493	We need to stop the practice
486.11	of lower castes and lower-status people
488.9	going down and being condemned to empty pits.
492.442	It is our moral, it is our social
494.422	and our environmental obligation.
496.571	Thank you.
498.64	(Applause)
