12.799	This picture
14.699	is from my metro card
16.373	when I spent a year abroad in Paris
16.373	in college in the mid-'90s.
20.799	My friend says I look
20.799	like a French anarchist --
23.994	(Laughter)
25.025	But this is still what I see
26.396	when I look in the mirror in the morning.
28.587	Within a month of living in Paris,
28.587	I'd lost 15 pounds
31.71	and I was in the best shape of my life
33.769	because I was eating fresh food
35.79	and I was walking wherever I went.
38.828	Having grown up in suburban Atlanta,
40.663	a region built largely
40.663	by highways and automobiles
44.092	and with a reputation
44.092	as a poster child for sprawl,
47.777	Paris fundamentally changed
47.777	the way I understood
50.363	the construction of the world around me,
53.107	and I got obsessed with the role
53.107	of infrastructure --
56.619	that it's not just the way to move people
56.619	from point A to point B,
60.737	it's not just the way to convey water
60.737	or sewage or energy,
64.85	but it's the foundation for our economy.
67.444	It's the foundation for our social life
67.444	and for our culture,
70.831	and it really matters
70.831	to the way that we live.
74.118	When I came home,
74.118	I was instantly frustrated,
76.726	stuck in traffic as I crossed
76.726	the top end of our perimeter highway.
80.676	Not only was I not moving a muscle,
82.967	I had no social interaction
84.636	with the hundreds of thousands of people
84.636	that were hurtling past me,
87.899	like me, with their eyes faced forward
87.899	and their music blaring.
92.765	I wondered if this was
92.765	an inevitable outcome,
95.586	or could we do something about it.
97.817	Was it possible to transform
97.817	this condition in Atlanta
101.069	into the kind of place
101.069	that I wanted to live in?
103.949	I went back to grad school
103.949	in architecture and city planning,
107.069	developed this interest in infrastructure,
109.425	and in 1999 came up with an idea
112.042	for my thesis project:
113.631	the adaptation of an obsolete loop
113.631	of old railroad circling downtown
117.972	as a new infrastructure
117.972	for urban revitalization.
121.036	It was just an idea.
122.8	I never thought
122.8	we would actually build it.
126.215	But I went to work
126.215	at an architecture firm,
128.723	and eventually talked
128.723	to my coworkers about it,
131.27	and they loved the idea.
133.062	And as we started talking
133.062	to more people about it,
135.472	more people wanted to hear about it.
137.889	In the summer of 2001,
140.269	we connected with Cathy Woolard,
141.92	who was soon elected
141.92	city council president.
144.075	And we built a citywide vision
144.075	around this idea:
147.525	the Atlanta BeltLine, a 22-mile loop
150.48	of transit and trails and transformation.
153.746	I was doing two and three meetings a week
153.746	for two and a half years,
158.083	and so was Cathy and her staff
158.083	and a handful of volunteers.
161.552	Together, we built this amazing movement
161.552	of people and ideas.
166.287	It included community advocates
166.287	who were used to fighting against things,
170.022	but found the Atlanta BeltLine
170.022	as something that they could fight for;
173.359	developers who saw the opportunity
175.108	to take advantage of a lot
175.108	of new growth in the city;
178.067	and dozens of nonprofit partners
178.067	who saw their mission
182.737	at least partly accomplished
182.737	by the shared vision.
187.293	Now, usually these groups of people
187.293	aren't at the same table
191.142	wanting the same outcome.
193.923	But there we were,
193.923	and it was kind of weird,
197.318	but it was really, really powerful.
199.937	The people of Atlanta
199.937	fell in love with a vision
202.794	that was better than what they saw
202.794	through their car windshields,
206.122	and the people of Atlanta made it happen,
208.648	and I guarantee you we would not
208.648	be building it otherwise.
212.476	From the beginning,
212.476	our coalition was diverse.
215.343	People of all stripes
215.343	were part of our story.
218.49	People on the lower end
218.49	of the economic spectrum loved it, too.
222.33	They were just afraid
222.33	they weren't going to be able to be there
225.544	when it got built,
225.544	that they'd be priced out.
227.737	And we've all heard
227.737	that kind of story before, right?
231.852	But we promised that
231.852	the Atlanta BeltLine would be different,
234.938	and people took ownership of the idea,
236.996	and they made it better
236.996	than anything we ever imagined
239.594	in the beginning,
240.819	including significant
240.819	subsidies for housing,
243.606	new parks, art, an arboretum --
243.606	a list that continues to grow.
248.936	And we put in place
250.126	the organizations and agencies
250.126	that were required to make it happen.
253.773	And importantly, it is.
256.126	Now we're in the early stages
256.126	of implementation, and it's working.
259.918	The first mainline section
259.918	of trail was opened in 2012,
264.735	and it's already generated
264.735	over three billion dollars
267.416	of private-sector investment.
270.784	But it's not only changing
270.784	the physical form of the city,
273.524	it's changing the way
273.524	we think about the city,
275.958	and what our expectations are
275.958	for living there.
280.171	About a month ago,
281.838	I had to take my kids with me
281.838	to the grocery store
284.697	and they were complaining about it,
286.393	because they didn't want
286.393	to get in the car.
288.465	"They were saying, ""Dad, if we have to go,"
292.489	"can we at least ride our bikes?"""
294.242	"And I said, ""Of course we can."
296.572	That's what people in Atlanta do.
298.631	"We ride our bikes to the grocery store."""
301.074	(Laughter)
302.331	(Applause)
303.955	Thank you, yeah.
305.234	Now, they don't know
305.234	how ridiculous that is,
308.497	but I do.
309.684	And I also understand
309.684	that their expectations for Atlanta
313.717	are really powerful.
315.642	This kind of transformation
315.642	is exactly like sprawl
319.02	in the last century,
320.647	the movement where our investment
320.647	in highways and automobiles
324.091	fundamentally changed American life.
326.686	That wasn't some grand conspiracy.
329.12	There were conspiracies
329.12	within it, of course.
332.044	But it was a cultural momentum.
334.161	It was millions of people
334.161	making millions of decisions
336.754	over an extended period of time,
338.37	that fundamentally changed
338.37	not only the way that we build cities,
342.156	but it changed our expectations
344.194	for our lives.
346.613	These changes were the foundations
346.613	for urban sprawl.
349.888	We didn't call it sprawl at that time.
352.026	We called it the future.
353.577	And it was.
354.991	And we got all the highways
354.991	and strip malls and cul-de-sacs we wanted.
359.43	It was a radical transformation,
361.82	but it was built by a cultural momentum.
364.457	So it's important to not separate
366.055	the physical construction
366.055	of the places we live
368.553	from other things that
368.553	are happening at that time.
371.268	At that time,
372.82	in the second half of the last century,
375.105	science was curing disease
377.121	and lifting us to the moon,
379.014	and the sexual revolution
379.014	was breaking down barriers,
381.569	and the Civil Rights Movement
381.569	began its march
383.705	toward the fulfillment
383.705	of our nation's promise.
386.664	Television, entertainment, food, travel,
386.664	business -- everything was changing,
391.425	and both the public
391.425	and private sectors were colluding
394.749	to give us the lives we wanted.
398.041	The Federal Highway Administration,
399.774	for example, didn't exist
399.774	before there were highways.
403.794	Think about it.
404.996	(Laughter)
406.044	Of course, today it's important
406.044	to understand and acknowledge
409.055	that those benefits accrued
409.055	to some groups of people
411.874	and not to others.
413.17	It was not an equitable cultural momentum.
416.692	But when we look today
416.692	in wonder and disgust, maybe,
420.382	at the metropolis sprawl before us,
422.869	we wonder if we're stuck.
425.067	Are we stuck with the legacy
425.067	of that inequity?
428.234	Are we stuck with this dystopian
428.234	traffic hellscape?
432.329	Are we stuck with rampant
432.329	urban displacement,
435.479	with environmental degradation?
438.504	Are we stuck with social isolation
441.061	or political polarization?
443.399	Are these the inevitable
443.399	and permanent outcomes?
446.744	Or are they the result
446.744	of our collective cultural decisions
449.746	that we've made for ourselves?
452.535	And if they are,
454.658	can't we change them?
456.803	What I have learned
456.803	from our experience in Atlanta
459.461	is not an anomaly.
460.994	Similar stories
460.994	are playing out everywhere,
463.389	where people are reclaiming
463.389	not only old railroads,
466.226	but also degraded urban waterways
466.226	and obsolete roadways,
470.109	reinventing all of the infrastructure
472.473	in their lives.
473.836	Whether here in New York
475.784	or in Houston
477.044	or Miami,
478.371	Detroit, Philadelphia,
481.058	Seoul, Hong Kong, Singapore,
483.394	Toronto and Paris,
485.055	cities big and small all over the world
485.055	are reclaiming and reinventing
489.207	this infrastructure for themselves,
490.904	including the mother
490.904	of all catalyst infrastructure projects,
495.489	the Los Angeles River,
497.485	the revitalization effort
497.485	for which similarly started
500.279	as a grassroots movement,
501.677	has developed into a cultural momentum,
504.037	and is now in the early stages
504.037	of being transformed
507.503	into some kind of life-affirming
507.503	infrastructure again,
510.832	this one with trails and parks
510.832	and fishing and boating
515.251	and community revitalization,
517.21	and of course, water quality
517.21	and flood control.
520.29	It's already improving
520.29	the lives of people.
522.794	It's already changing the way
522.794	the rest of us think about Los Angeles.
527.246	This is more than just infrastructure.
529.729	We're building new lives for ourselves.
532.214	It's a movement that includes
532.214	local food, urban agriculture,
535.792	craft beer, the maker movement,
538.062	tech and design -- all of these things,
538.062	early indicators of a really radical shift
542.865	in the way we build cities.
545.132	We're taking places like this
548.534	and transforming them into this.
552.669	And soon this.
555.063	And this is all exciting and good.
558.436	We're changing the world for the better.
560.426	Good for us!
562.263	And it is awesome -- I mean that.
564.956	But our history of sprawl,
566.95	and from what we can already see
566.95	with these catalyst projects today,
570.91	we know and must remember
573.118	that big changes like this
573.118	don't usually benefit everyone.
576.999	The market forces unleashed
576.999	by this cultural momentum
580.574	often include the seemingly unstoppable
583.023	and inevitable cycle of rising taxes,
583.023	prices and rents.
587.933	This is urgent.
589.332	If we care, we have to stand up
591.498	and speak out.
592.839	This should be a call to action,
594.646	because the answer can't be
594.646	to not improve communities.
598.717	The answer can't be to not build parks
598.717	and transit and grocery stores.
603.215	The answer can't be
603.215	to hold communities down
606.152	just to keep them affordable.
608.523	But we do have to follow through
608.523	and address the financial realities
611.824	that we're facing.
613.078	This is hard, and it won't
613.078	happen on its own.
615.897	We can do it, and I'm committed
615.897	to this goal in Atlanta,
618.794	to sticking up again for people
618.794	who made it possible in the first place.
623.52	We can't call it a success without them.
626.105	I certainly can't,
627.436	because the people I made
627.436	commitments to all those years
630.392	weren't abstract populations.
632.615	They're my friends and neighbors.
634.459	They're people that I love.
636.974	So even though it started
636.974	as my graduate thesis
639.532	and I'm working hard for 16 years
639.532	with thousands of people
642.528	to help make this thing come to life,
644.702	I know and believe that who
644.702	the BeltLine is being built for
648.643	is just as important
648.643	as whether it's built at all.
652.065	Not just in Atlanta,
653.944	but locally and globally,
655.437	we have to understand
657.606	this accountability to the people
657.606	whose lives we are changing,
661.287	because this is us.
663.418	We are the lives we're talking about.
666.431	These places aren't inevitable.
668.092	The places we live aren't inevitable,
670.797	and if we want something different,
670.797	we just need to speak up.
673.839	We have to ensure that change
673.839	comes on our terms.
676.437	And to do that,
677.616	we have to participate actively
677.616	in the process of shaping change.
682.547	Thank you.
683.723	(Applause)
