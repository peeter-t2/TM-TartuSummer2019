16.346	About 75 years ago,
18.036	my grandfather, a young man,
20.595	walked into a tent
22.506	that was converted into a
24.003	movie theater like that,
25.714	and he fell hopelessly in love
27.914	with the woman he saw on the
29.243	silver screen: none other than Mae West,
32.572	the heartthrob of the '30s,
34.487	and he could never forget her.
36.527	In fact, when he had his daughter
38.447	many years later, he wanted to
40.639	name her after Mae West,
42.055	but can you imagine an Indian
43.639	child name Mae West?
45.175	The Indian family said, no way!
46.861	So when my twin brother Kaesava
49.799	was born, he decided to tinker
52.309	with the spelling of Keshava's name.
54.024	He said, if Mae West can be M-A-E,
57.735	why can't Keshava be K-A-E?
61.271	So he changed Kaesava's spelling.
63.511	Now Kaesava had a baby boy
65.582	called Rehan a couple of weeks ago.
67.782	He decided to spell, or, rather,
70.013	misspell Raehan with an A-E.
72.093	You know, my grandfather died
74.228	many years ago when I was
75.588	little, but his love for Mae
77.429	West lives on as a misspelling
79.9	in the DNA of his progeny.
81.676	That for me is successful legacy. (Laughs)
84.82	You know, as for me,
86.462	my wife and I have our own
87.689	crazy legacy project.
89.297	We actually sit every few years,
91.489	argue, disagree, fight,
93.862	and actually come up with our
95.704	very own 200-year plan.
97.72	Our friends think we're mad.
99.68	Our parents think we're cuckoo.
101.168	Because, you know, we both
102.504	come from families that really
103.872	look up to humility and wisdom,
106.873	but we both like to live
108.504	larger than life.
109.841	I believe in the concept of
111.351	a Raja Yogi: Be a dude before
114.112	you can become an ascetic.
115.425	This is me being a rock star,
116.92	even if it's in my own house.
118.544	You know?
119.808	So when Netra and I sat down
121.52	to make our first plan
124.96	we want the focus of this plan
127.064	to go way beyond ourselves.
128.88	What do we mean by beyond ourselves?
131.544	Well 200 years, we calculated,
134.569	is at the end of our direct
136.744	contact with the world.
137.912	There's nobody I'll meet in
139.271	my life will ever live beyond
143.488	that's a perfect place where
144.68	we should situate our plan and
146.592	let our imagination take flight.
148.32	You know, I never really
149.864	believed in legacy. What am I
151.552	going to leave behind? I'm an artist.
153.544	Until I made a cartoon about 9/11.
156.83	It caused so much trouble for me.
159.478	I was so upset.
160.894	You know, a cartoon that was
163.374	meant to be a cartoon of the week
165.038	ended up staying so much longer.
168.27	Now I'm in the business of
170.424	creating art that will
172.101	definitely even outlive me, and
174.464	I think about what I want to
176.125	leave behind through those paintings.
178.165	You know, the 9/11 cartoon
180.157	upset me so much that I decided
183.453	I'll never cartoon again.
184.989	I said, I'm never going to make any
186.205	honest public commentary again.
188.118	But of course I continued
190.613	creating artwork that was honest
192.549	and raw, because I forgot about
194.726	how people reacted to my work.
196.944	You know, sometimes forgetting
198.518	is so important to remain idealistic.
201.509	Perhaps loss of memory is so
204.246	crucial for our survival
206.189	as human beings.
207.558	One of the most important things
209.413	in my 200-year plan that Netra
211.317	and I write is what to forget
213.703	about ourselves.
215.016	You know, we carry so much
216.437	baggage, from our parents,
217.846	from our society, from so many
219.854	people -- fears, insecurities -- and
223.598	our 200-year plan really lists
225.453	all our childhood problems that we have to expire.
228.505	We actually put an expiry date
230.006	on all our childhood problems.
232.48	The latest date I put was,
234.345	I said, I am going to expire
237.106	my fear of my leftist, feminist
239.649	mother-in-law, and this
242.058	today is the date! (Laughs)
245.18	She's watching. (Laughter)
246.771	Anyway, you know, I really
251.619	make decisions all the time
253.619	about how I want to remember
255.204	myself, and that's the most important
258.476	kind of decisions I make.
259.995	And this directly translates
261.867	into my paintings.
263.19	But like my friends, I can do
265.332	that really well on Facebook,
266.908	Pinterest, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube.
268.827	Name it, I'm on it.
270.26	I've started outsourcing my
272.339	memory to the digital world,
273.932	you know? But that comes
275.372	with a problem.
276.468	It's so easy to think of
278.099	technology as a metaphor
279.404	for memory, but our brains
281.75	are not perfect storage devices
283.697	like technology.
284.496	We only remember what we
286.036	want to. At least I do.
287.291	And I rather think of our brains
289.794	as biased curators of our
292.193	memory, you know? And if
295.033	technology is not a metaphor for
296.857	memory, what is it?
298.489	Netra and I use our technology
301.505	as a tool in our 200-year plan
304.073	to really curate our digital legacy.
307.592	That is a picture of my mother,
310.609	and she recently got a Facebook account.
313.362	You know where this is going.
315.128	And I've been very supportive
316.962	until this picture shows up
319.345	on my Facebook page. (Laughter)
320.912	And I actually untagged myself
324.169	first, then I picked up the
325.633	"phone. I said, ""Mom, you will"
326.992	never put a picture of me
328.104	"in a bikini ever again."""
329.393	"And she said, ""Why? You look"
332.321	"so cute, darling."" I said,"
334.44	"""You just don't understand."""
336.233	Maybe we are among the first
338.216	generation that really understands
339.537	this digital curating of ourselves.
341.728	Maybe we are the first to even
343.29	actively record our lives.
345.528	You know, whether you
347.08	agree with, you know, legacy
349.233	or not, we are actually leaving
351.376	behind digital traces all the time.
353.729	So Netra and I really wanted
355.784	to use our 200-year plan
357.144	to curate this digital legacy,
359.321	and not only digital legacy
361.16	but we believe in curating
362.32	the legacy of my past
364.208	and future.
365.392	How, you may ask?
367.225	Well, when I think of the future,
370.793	I never see myself moving forward
372.985	in time. I actually see time
375.017	moving backward towards me.
377.089	I can actually visualize
378.489	my future approaching.
379.84	I can dodge what I don't want
381.953	and pull in what I want.
383.441	It's like a video game obstacle
384.752	course. And I've gotten better and better
387.238	at doing this. Even when I make
389.071	a painting, I actually imagine
391.104	I'm behind the painting,
393.135	it already exists, and
394.318	someone's looking at it,
395.534	and I see whether they're
396.624	feeling it from their gut.
398.245	Are they feeling it from their
399.478	heart, or is it just a cerebral thing?
402.144	And it really informs my painting.
404.252	Even when I do an art show,
405.443	I really think about, what should
406.467	people walk away with?
408.019	I remember when I was 19,
410.955	I did, I wanted to do my first
413.092	art exhibition, and I wanted the
416.292	whole world to know about it.
417.699	I didn't know TED then,
419.147	but what I did was I closed
421.148	my eyes tight, and I started
422.916	dreaming. I could imagine people
425.188	coming in, dressed up, looking
426.731	beautiful, my paintings with all
428.764	the light, and in my visualization
431.475	I actually saw a very famous
433.331	actress launching my show,
435.499	giving credibility to me.
436.996	And I woke up from my
439.059	visualization and I said,
440.316	who was that? I couldn't tell
442.052	if it was Shabana Azmi or Rekha,
444.291	two very famous Indian actresses,
446.5	like the Meryl Streeps of India.
448.347	As it turned out, next morning
450.707	I wrote a letter to both of them,
452.427	and Shabana Azmi replied,
454.38	and came and launched
456.147	my very first show 12 years ago.
459.212	And what a bang it started
461.444	my career with! You know,
463.244	when we think of time in this
465.66	way, we can curate not only the
467.979	future but also the past.
471.496	This is a picture of my family,
473.7	and that is Netra, my wife.
476.323	She's the co-creator of my
479.436	Netra's a high school history
481.475	teacher. I love Netra,
483.419	but I hate history.
485.236	"I keep saying, ""Nets, you live"
487.148	in the past while I'll create
488.795	the future, and when I'm done,
490.796	"you can study about it."""
492.292	(Laughter)
494.252	She gave me an indulgent smile,
496.251	and as punishment, she said,
498.388	"""Tomorrow I'm teaching a class"
500.123	on Indian history, and you are
502.284	"sitting in it, and I'm grading you."""
503.732	"I'm like, ""Oh, God."" I went."
506.075	I actually went and sat in
507.379	on her class. She started by
509.572	giving students primary source
511.867	documents from India, Pakistan,
514.482	from Britain, and I said,
516.731	"""Wow."" Then she asked them to"
518.875	separate fact from bias.
520.827	"I said, ""Wow,"" again."
523.619	"Then she said, ""Choose your"
526.579	facts and biases and create an
529.883	image of your own story
532.162	"of dignity."""
533.571	History as an imaging tool?
536.826	I was so inspired.
538.459	I went and created my own
539.819	version of Indian history.
541.396	I actually included stories from
543.283	my grandmother.
544.305	She used to work for the
545.464	telephone exchange, and she used
547.032	to actually overhear conversations
548.159	between Nehru and Edwina Mountbatten.
550.328	And she used to hear all
551.904	kinds of things she shouldn't
553.039	have heard. But, you know,
555.545	I include things like that.
556.711	This is my version of Indian history.
559.505	You know, if this
563.791	is so, it occurred to me that
565.905	maybe, just maybe, the primary
568.128	objective of our brains
569.567	is to serve our dignity.
572.607	Go tell Facebook to
574.615	figure that out!
575.924	Netra and I don't write our
580.357	to come and execute it
581.381	in 150 years. Imagine receiving
583.524	a parcel saying, from the past,
585.421	okay now you're supposed to
586.784	spend the rest of your life
587.749	doing all of this. No.
589.207	We actually write it only
590.854	to set our attitudes right.
593.344	You know, I used to believe
597.184	that education is the most
598.584	important tool to leave
600.065	a meaningful legacy.
601.522	Education is great.
603.046	It really teaches us who
604.695	we are, and helps us
606.031	contextualize ourselves
607.35	in the world, but it's really
609.316	my creativity that's taught me
611.375	that I can be much more
613.152	than what my education told me I am.
615.343	I'd like to make
616.797	the argument that creativity is
619.127	the most important tool we have.
621.558	It lets us create who we are,
623.744	and curate what is to come.
625.655	I like to think -- Thank you.
628.895	I like to think of myself
630.47	as a storyteller, where my past
632.806	and my future are only stories,
635.87	my stories, waiting to be told
638.159	and retold. I hope all of you
640.774	one day get a chance to
642.718	share and write your own
645.91	Thank you so much.
646.975	Shukran! (Applause)
