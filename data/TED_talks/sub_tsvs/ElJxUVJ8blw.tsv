12.716	I'm going to share with you
12.716	a paradigm-shifting perspective
16.047	on the issues of gender violence:
16.047	sexual assault, domestic violence,
19.346	relationship abuse, sexual harassment,
19.346	sexual abuse of children.
22.538	That whole range of issues
23.872	that I'll refer to in shorthand
23.872	"as ""gender violence issues,"""
26.783	they've been seen as women's issues
26.783	that some good men help out with,
30.891	but I have a problem with that frame
30.891	and I don't accept it.
33.69	I don't see these as women's issues
33.69	that some good men help out with.
36.967	In fact, I'm going to argue
36.967	that these are men's issues,
39.628	first and foremost.
41.038	Now obviously --
42.25	(Applause)
43.532	Obviously, they're also women's issues,
43.532	so I appreciate that,
46.44	but calling gender violence
46.44	a women's issue is part of the problem,
51.111	for a number of reasons.
52.763	The first is that it gives men
52.763	an excuse not to pay attention, right?
56.261	A lot of men hear
56.261	"the term ""women's issues"""
58.331	and we tend to tune it out, and we think,
60.344	"""I'm a guy; that's for the girls,"""
60.344	"or ""that's for the women."""
63.273	And a lot of men literally don't get
63.273	beyond the first sentence as a result.
67.185	It's almost like a chip
67.185	in our brain is activated,
69.562	and the neural pathways take
69.562	our attention in a different direction
72.746	"when we hear the term ""women's issues."""
74.631	This is also true, by the way,
74.631	"of the word ""gender,"""
77.114	because a lot of people
77.114	"hear the word ""gender"""
79.456	"and they think it means ""women."""
81.06	So they think that gender issues
81.06	is synonymous with women's issues.
84.264	There's some confusion
84.264	about the term gender.
86.399	And let me illustrate
86.399	that confusion by way of analogy.
89.008	So let's talk for a moment about race.
90.854	"In the US, when we hear the word ""race,"""
92.798	a lot of people think
92.798	that means African-American,
95.184	Latino, Asian-American, Native American,
97.281	South Asian, Pacific Islander, on and on.
100.369	A lot of people, when they hear
100.369	"the word ""sexual orientation"""
103.305	think it means gay, lesbian, bisexual.
105.744	And a lot of people,
105.744	"when they hear the word ""gender,"""
108.309	think it means women.
109.487	In each case, the dominant group
109.487	doesn't get paid attention to.
112.487	As if white people don't have
112.487	some sort of racial identity
115.261	or belong to some racial
115.261	category or construct,
118.275	as if heterosexual people
118.275	don't have a sexual orientation,
121.835	as if men don't have a gender.
123.959	This is one of the ways that dominant
123.959	systems maintain and reproduce themselves,
127.761	which is to say the dominant group
127.761	is rarely challenged
130.374	to even think about its dominance,
132.058	because that's one of the key
132.058	characteristics of power and privilege,
135.335	the ability to go unexamined,
136.77	lacking introspection, in fact being
136.77	rendered invisible, in large measure,
141.971	in the discourse about issues
141.971	that are primarily about us.
145.425	And this is amazing how this works
145.425	in domestic and sexual violence,
148.639	how men have been largely erased
148.639	from so much of the conversation
152.23	about a subject
152.23	that is centrally about men.
155.245	And I'm going to illustrate
155.245	what I'm talking about
157.604	by using the old tech.
158.976	I'm old school
158.976	on some fundamental regards.
161.707	I make films and I work with high tech,
164.466	but I'm still old school as an educator,
167.11	and I want to share with you this exercise
169.72	that illustrates
169.72	on the sentence-structure level
172.477	how the way that we think,
172.477	literally the way that we use language,
177.032	conspires to keep
177.032	our attention off of men.
179.199	This is about domestic
179.199	violence in particular,
181.41	but you can plug in other analogues.
184.858	This comes from the work
184.858	of the feminist linguist Julia Penelope.
187.946	It starts with a very basic
187.946	English sentence:
190.138	"""John beat Mary."""
193.591	That's a good English sentence.
195.116	John is the subject, beat is the verb,
195.116	Mary is the object, good sentence.
198.626	Now we're going to move
198.626	to the second sentence,
200.864	which says the same thing
200.864	in the passive voice.
203.234	"""Mary was beaten by John."""
209.564	And now a whole lot
209.564	has happened in one sentence.
212.374	"We've gone from ""John beat Mary"""
214.503	"to ""Mary was beaten by John."""
216.322	We've shifted our focus
216.322	in one sentence from John to Mary,
219.609	and you can see John is very close
219.609	to the end of the sentence,
222.54	well, close to dropping
222.54	off the map of our psychic plain.
225.53	The third sentence, John is dropped,
227.274	"and we have, ""Mary was beaten,"""
230.612	and now it's all about Mary.
232.508	We're not even thinking about John,
232.508	it's totally focused on Mary.
235.594	Over the past generation,
236.829	the term we've used
236.829	"synonymous with ""beaten"" is ""battered,"""
239.629	"so we have ""Mary was battered."""
243.324	And the final sentence in this sequence,
243.324	flowing from the others, is,
247.142	"""Mary is a battered woman."""
249.84	So now Mary's very identity --
249.84	Mary is a battered woman --
257.673	is what was done to her by John
257.673	in the first instance.
260.244	But we've demonstrated that John
260.244	has long ago left the conversation.
263.484	Those of us who work
263.484	in the domestic and sexual violence field
266.424	know that victim-blaming
266.424	is pervasive in this realm,
268.965	which is to say, blaming the person
268.965	to whom something was done
271.928	rather than the person who did it.
273.583	And we say: why do they
273.583	go out with these men?
275.815	Why are they attracted to them?
275.815	Why do they keep going back?
278.719	What was she wearing at that party?
278.719	What a stupid thing to do.
281.695	Why was she drinking
281.695	with those guys in that hotel room?
284.407	This is victim blaming,
284.407	and there are many reasons for it,
287.196	but one is that our cognitive structure
287.196	is set up to blame victims.
290.826	This is all unconscious.
292.017	Our whole cognitive structure
292.017	is set up to ask questions
294.666	about women and women's choices
294.666	and what they're doing, thinking, wearing.
298.181	And I'm not going to shout down
298.181	people who ask questions about women.
301.527	It's a legitimate thing to ask.
303.052	But's let's be clear:
303.052	Asking questions about Mary
305.375	is not going to get us anywhere
305.375	in terms of preventing violence.
308.531	We have to ask a different
308.531	set of questions.
310.616	The questions are not about Mary,
310.616	they're about John.
314.297	They include things like,
314.297	why does John beat Mary?
317.11	Why is domestic violence still a big
317.11	problem in the US and all over the world?
320.965	What's going on?
320.965	Why do so many men abuse physically,
323.639	emotionally, verbally, and other ways,
325.849	the women and girls, and the men and boys,
325.849	that they claim to love?
329.099	What's going on with men?
330.678	Why do so many adult men
330.678	sexually abuse little girls and boys?
334.156	Why is that a common problem
334.156	in our society
336.345	and all over the world today?
338.224	Why do we hear over and over again
339.868	about new scandals erupting
339.868	in major institutions
343.29	like the Catholic Church
343.29	or the Penn State football program
346.591	or the Boy Scouts of America,
346.591	on and on and on?
348.815	And then local communities
348.815	all over the country
351.054	and all over the world.
352.243	We hear about it all the time.
353.727	The sexual abuse of children.
355.249	What's going on with men?
355.249	Why do so many men rape women
358.663	in our society and around the world?
360.438	Why do so many men rape other men?
362.189	What is going on with men?
363.76	And then what is the role
363.76	of the various institutions in our society
368.752	that are helping to produce
368.752	abusive men at pandemic rates?
371.56	Because this isn't
371.56	about individual perpetrators.
373.894	That's a naive way to understanding
373.894	what is a much deeper
376.638	and more systematic social problem.
378.349	The perpetrators aren't these monsters
378.349	who crawl out of the swamp
382.044	and come into town
382.044	and do their nasty business
384.512	and then retreat into the darkness.
386.455	That's a very naive notion, right?
388.761	Perpetrators are much more normal
388.761	than that, and everyday than that.
392.079	So the question is, what are we doing here
392.079	in our society and in the world?
396.48	What are the roles of various institutions
398.509	in helping to produce abusive men?
401.04	What's the role of religious
401.04	belief systems,
403.147	the sports culture,
403.147	the pornography culture,
405.312	the family structure, economics,
405.312	and how that intersects,
408.051	and race and ethnicity
408.051	and how that intersects?
410.314	How does all this work?
411.817	And then, once we start making
411.817	those kinds of connections
414.744	and asking those important
414.744	and big questions,
417.402	then we can talk about
417.402	how we can be transformative,
419.884	in other words, how can we do
419.884	something differently?
422.359	How can we change the practices?
423.961	How can we change
423.961	the socialization of boys
425.991	and the definitions of manhood
425.991	that lead to these current outcomes?
429.44	These are the kind of questions
429.44	that we need to be asking
432.154	and the kind of work
432.154	that we need to be doing,
434.338	but if we're endlessly focused
434.338	on what women are doing and thinking
437.925	in relationships or elsewhere,
439.636	we're not going to get to that piece.
442.082	I understand that a lot of women
443.769	who have been trying to speak out
443.769	about these issues,
446.272	today and yesterday
446.272	and for years and years,
448.363	often get shouted down for their efforts.
450.643	They get called nasty names
450.643	"like ""male-basher"" and ""man-hater,"""
455.663	and the disgusting
455.663	"and offensive ""feminazi"", right?"
462.229	And you know what all this is about?
463.994	It's called kill the messenger.
465.522	It's because the women who are standing up
467.553	and speaking out for themselves
467.553	and for other women
469.995	as well as for men and boys,
472.204	it's a statement to them
472.204	to sit down and shut up,
474.6	keep the current system in place,
476.232	because we don't like it
476.232	when people rock the boat.
478.654	We don't like it when people
478.654	challenge our power.
481.026	You'd better sit
481.026	down and shut up, basically.
483.172	And thank goodness
483.172	that women haven't done that.
485.447	Thank goodness that we live in a world
487.345	where there's so much women's leadership
487.345	that can counteract that.
490.491	But one of the powerful roles
490.491	that men can play in this work
493.357	is that we can say some things
493.357	that sometimes women can't say,
496.307	or, better yet, we can be heard
496.307	saying some things
498.714	that women often can't be heard saying.
500.691	Now, I appreciate that that's a problem,
500.691	it's sexism, but it's the truth.
504.197	So one of the things that I say to men,
506.119	and my colleagues and I always say this,
508.082	is we need more men
508.082	who have the courage and the strength
510.791	to start standing up and saying
510.791	some of this stuff,
513.225	and standing with women
513.225	and not against them
515.35	and pretending that somehow
515.35	this is a battle between the sexes
518.342	and other kinds of nonsense.
519.712	We live in the world together.
521.212	And by the way, one of the things
521.212	that really bothers me
523.908	about some of the rhetoric
523.908	against feminists and others
526.519	who have built the battered women's
526.519	and rape crisis movements around the world
530.245	is that somehow, like I said,
530.245	that they're anti-male.
532.773	What about all the boys who are profoundly
532.773	affected in a negative way
536.052	by what some adult man is doing against
536.052	their mother, themselves, their sisters?
539.859	What about all those boys?
541.159	What about all the young men and boys
542.951	who have been traumatized
542.951	by adult men's violence?
545.336	You know what?
546.548	The same system that produces
546.548	men who abuse women,
548.952	produces men who abuse other men.
550.563	And if we want to talk about male victims,
550.563	let's talk about male victims.
554.055	Most male victims of violence
554.055	are the victims of other men's violence.
557.385	So that's something that both women
557.385	and men have in common.
560.195	We are both victims of men's violence.
562.1	So we have it in our direct self-interest,
564.156	not to mention the fact
564.156	that most men that I know
566.47	have women and girls
566.47	that we care deeply about,
568.703	in our families and our friendship
568.703	circles and every other way.
571.705	So there's so many reasons
571.705	why we need men to speak out.
574.378	It seems obvious saying it
574.378	out loud, doesn't it?
577.751	Now, the nature of the work
577.751	that I do and my colleagues do
581.348	in the sports culture
581.348	and the US military, in schools,
585.029	we pioneered this approach
585.029	called the bystander approach
587.901	to gender-violence prevention.
589.913	And I just want to give you
589.913	the highlights of the bystander approach,
593.256	because it's a big thematic shift,
595.715	although there's lots of particulars,
597.56	but the heart of it is,
597.56	instead of seeing men as perpetrators
600.882	and women as victims,
602.144	or women as perpetrators, men as victims,
605.624	or any combination in there.
607.211	I'm using the gender binary.
608.628	I know there's more than men and women,
608.628	there's more than male and female.
612.15	And there are women who are perpetrators,
614.131	and of course there are
614.131	men who are victims.
616.302	There's a whole spectrum.
617.538	But instead of seeing it
617.538	in the binary fashion,
619.773	we focus on all of us
619.773	as what we call bystanders,
622.153	and a bystander is defined as anybody
622.153	who is not a perpetrator or a victim
626.344	in a given situation,
627.976	so in other words friends, teammates,
627.976	colleagues, coworkers, family members,
632.038	those of us who are not directly
632.038	involved in a dyad of abuse,
635.976	but we are embedded in social,
635.976	family, work, school,
639.322	and other peer culture relationships
641.106	with people who might be
641.106	in that situation.
643.158	What do we do? How do we speak up?
643.158	How do we challenge our friends?
646.382	How do we support our friends?
647.9	But how do we not remain silent
647.9	in the face of abuse?
650.435	Now, when it comes
650.435	to men and male culture,
653.145	the goal is to get men who are not abusive
653.145	to challenge men who are.
656.565	And when I say abusive, I don't mean just
656.565	men who are beating women.
659.836	We're not just saying a man whose friend
659.836	is abusing his girlfriend
664.656	needs to stop the guy
664.656	at the moment of attack.
667.497	That's a naive way
667.497	of creating a social change.
671.975	It's along a continuum, we're trying
671.975	to get men to interrupt each other.
675.895	So, for example, if you're a guy
675.895	and you're in a group of guys
678.847	playing poker, talking, hanging out,
678.847	no women present,
681.739	and another guy says something sexist
681.739	or degrading or harassing about women,
688.112	instead of laughing along
688.112	or pretending you didn't hear it,
690.988	we need men to say,
690.988	"""Hey, that's not funny."
693.029	that could be my sister
693.029	you're talking about,
695.303	and could you joke about something else?
697.291	Or could you talk about something else?
699.191	"I don't appreciate that kind of talk."""
701.046	Just like if you're a white person
702.715	and another white person makes
702.715	a racist comment, you'd hope, I hope,
705.982	that white people would interrupt
705.982	that racist enactment
708.63	by a fellow white person.
709.891	Just like with heterosexism,
709.891	if you're a heterosexual person
712.781	and you yourself don't enact
712.781	harassing or abusive behaviors
715.612	towards people of varying
715.612	sexual orientations,
717.846	if you don't say something in the face
717.846	of other heterosexual people doing that,
721.59	then, in a sense, isn't your silence
721.59	a form of consent and complicity?
724.925	Well, the bystander approach
724.925	is trying to give people tools
727.784	to interrupt that process and to speak up
727.784	and to create a peer culture climate
731.629	where the abusive behavior
731.629	will be seen as unacceptable,
734.317	not just because it's illegal,
734.317	but because it's wrong
737.108	and unacceptable in the peer culture.
739.183	And if we can get to the place where men
741.603	who act out in sexist ways
741.603	will lose status,
743.918	young men and boys who act out in sexist
745.847	and harassing ways
745.847	towards girls and women,
747.887	as well as towards other boys and men,
749.85	will lose status
749.85	as a result of it, guess what?
752.391	We'll see a radical
752.391	diminution of the abuse.
755.396	Because the typical perpetrator
755.396	is not sick and twisted.
758.067	He's a normal guy
758.067	in every other way, isn't he?
760.785	Now, among the many great
760.785	things that Martin Luther King
764.177	said in his short life was,
765.72	"""In the end, what will hurt the most"
765.72	is not the words of our enemies
769.147	"but the silence of our friends."""
771.225	In the end, what will hurt the most
771.225	is not the words of our enemies
774.42	but the silence of our friends.
775.959	There's been an awful lot
775.959	of silence in male culture
778.438	about this ongoing tragedy
778.438	of men's violence
780.535	against women and children, hasn't there?
782.529	There's been an awful lot of silence.
784.339	And all I'm saying is that we need
784.339	to break that silence,
787.215	and we need more men to do that.
789.475	Now, it's easier said than done,
792.798	because I'm saying it now,
794.212	but I'm telling you
794.212	it's not easy in male culture
796.71	for guys to challenge each other,
798.635	which is one of the reasons
801.04	why part of the paradigm shift
801.04	that has to happen
803.372	is not just understanding
803.372	these issues as men's issues,
806.134	but they're also
806.134	leadership issues for men.
808.205	Because ultimately, the responsibility
808.205	for taking a stand on these issues
811.667	should not fall
811.667	on the shoulders of little boys
813.966	or teenage boys in high school
813.966	or college men.
816.81	It should be on adult men with power.
818.779	Adult men with power are the ones
818.779	we need to be holding accountable
821.964	for being leaders on these issues,
823.653	because when somebody
823.653	speaks up in a peer culture
825.996	and challenges and interrupts,
827.956	he or she is being a leader, really.
830.554	But on a big scale,
830.554	we need more adult men with power
833.829	to start prioritizing these issues,
835.999	and we haven't seen that yet, have we?
838.452	Now, I was at a dinner
838.452	a number of years ago,
841.882	and I work extensively
841.882	with the US military, all the services.
845.095	And I was at this dinner
845.095	and this woman said to me --
848.636	I think she thought
848.636	she was a little clever --
850.817	"she said, ""So how long have you been doing"
850.817	"sensitivity training with the Marines?"""
855.387	"And I said, ""With all due respect,"
858.657	I don't do sensitivity training
858.657	with the Marines.
861.21	I run a leadership program
861.21	"in the Marine Corps."""
863.512	Now, I know it's a bit
863.512	pompous, my response,
865.61	but it's an important distinction,
867.395	because I don't believe
867.395	that what we need is sensitivity training.
870.568	We need leadership training,
870.568	because, for example,
873.028	when a professional coach or a manager
873.028	of a baseball team or a football team --
876.818	and I work extensively
876.818	in that realm as well --
879.148	makes a sexist comment,
879.148	makes a homophobic statement,
882.375	makes a racist comment,
883.94	there will be discussions on the sports
883.94	blogs and in sports talk radio.
887.344	And some people will say,
887.344	"""He needs sensitivity training."""
890.15	"Other people will say, ""Well, get off it."
892.179	That's political correctness run amok,
894.373	"he made a stupid statement, move on."""
896.201	My argument is, he doesn't need
896.201	sensitivity training.
898.855	He needs leadership training,
900.287	because he's being a bad leader,
901.847	because in a society with gender diversity
901.847	and sexual diversity --
904.998	(Applause)
906.087	and racial and ethnic diversity,
907.65	you make those kind of comments,
907.65	you're failing at your leadership.
910.881	If we can make this point that I'm making
913.093	to powerful men and women in our society
915.758	at all levels of institutional
915.758	authority and power,
918.853	it's going to change
918.853	the paradigm of people's thinking.
922.655	You know, for example,
924.185	I work a lot in college
924.185	and university athletics
926.485	throughout North America.
929.087	We know so much about how to prevent
929.087	domestic and sexual violence, right?
933.613	There's no excuse
933.613	for a college or university
936.009	to not have domestic and sexual
936.009	violence prevention training
938.891	mandated for all student athletes,
938.891	coaches, administrators,
941.725	as part of their educational process.
944.097	We know enough to know
944.097	that we can easily do that.
946.669	But you know what's missing?
946.669	The leadership.
948.781	But it's not the leadership
948.781	of student athletes.
951.045	It's the leadership
951.045	of the athletic director,
953.199	the president of the university,
953.199	the people in charge
955.734	who make decisions about resources
957.427	and who make decisions about priorities
957.427	in the institutional settings.
960.754	That's a failure, in most cases,
960.754	of men's leadership.
963.314	Look at Penn State.
964.532	Penn State is the mother of all teachable
964.532	moments for the bystander approach.
968.664	You had so many situations in that realm
971.149	where men in powerful
971.149	positions failed to act
974.816	to protect children, in this case, boys.
977.251	It's unbelievable, really.
978.528	But when you get into it,
978.528	you realize there are pressures on men.
981.635	There are constraints
981.635	within peer cultures on men,
984.46	which is why we need to encourage men
984.46	to break through those pressures.
988.668	And one of the ways to do that is to say
990.621	there's an awful lot of men
990.621	who care deeply about these issues.
993.625	I know this, I work with men,
995.13	and I've been working
995.13	with tens of thousands,
997.333	hundreds of thousands of men
997.333	for many decades now.
999.721	It's scary, when you think
999.721	about it, how many years.
1002.219	But there's so many men
1002.219	who care deeply about these issues,
1005.699	but caring deeply is not enough.
1007.864	We need more men with the guts,
1010.378	with the courage, with the strength,
1010.378	with the moral integrity
1013.837	to break our complicit silence
1013.837	and challenge each other
1017.853	and stand with women and not against them.
1020.192	By the way, we owe it to women.
1021.907	There's no question about it.
1023.373	But we also owe it to our sons.
1025.018	We also owe it to young men
1025.018	who are growing up all over the world
1028.261	in situations where they didn't
1028.261	make the choice
1030.552	to be a man in a culture that tells them
1030.552	that manhood is a certain way.
1033.949	They didn't make the choice.
1035.639	We that have a choice, have an opportunity
1035.639	and a responsibility to them as well.
1040.66	I hope that, going forward, men and women,
1043.615	working together, can begin the change
1045.931	and the transformation that will happen
1047.931	so that future generations
1047.931	won't have the level of tragedy
1050.73	that we deal with on a daily basis.
1052.53	I know we can do it, we can do better.
1054.364	Thank you very much.
