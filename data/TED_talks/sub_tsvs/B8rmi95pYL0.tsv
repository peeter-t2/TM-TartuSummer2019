15.408	I'm going to talk to you about optimism --
18.79	or more precisely, the optimism bias.
21.273	It's a cognitive illusion
22.918	that we've been studying in my lab for the past few years,
25.66	and 80 percent of us have it.
27.395	It's our tendency to overestimate
30.129	our likelihood of experiencing good events in our lives
33.052	and underestimate our likelihood of experiencing bad events.
37.16	So we underestimate our likelihood of suffering from cancer,
40.177	being in a car accident.
41.683	We overestimate our longevity, our career prospects.
44.869	In short, we're more optimistic than realistic,
48.314	but we are oblivious to the fact.
50.476	Take marriage for example.
52.703	In the Western world, divorce rates are about 40 percent.
56.237	That means that out of five married couples,
59.706	two will end up splitting their assets.
62.427	But when you ask newlyweds about their own likelihood of divorce,
65.802	they estimate it at zero percent.
69.494	And even divorce lawyers, who should really know better,
73.223	hugely underestimate their own likelihood of divorce.
77.072	So it turns out that optimists are not less likely to divorce,
80.198	but they are more likely to remarry.
82.728	In the words of Samuel Johnson,
85.031	"""Remarriage is the triumph of hope over experience."""
89.028	(Laughter)
90.99	So if we're married, we're more likely to have kids.
95.564	And we all think our kids will be especially talented.
98.829	This, by the way, is my two-year-old nephew, Guy.
101.427	And I just want to make it absolutely clear
103.802	that he's a really bad example of the optimism bias,
106.573	because he is in fact uniquely talented.
109.385	(Laughter)
110.82	And I'm not alone.
112.427	Out of four British people, three said
114.902	that they were optimistic about the future of their own families.
118.641	That's 75 percent.
120.392	But only 30 percent said
122.45	that they thought families in general
125.01	are doing better than a few generations ago.
127.422	And this is a really important point,
129.443	because we're optimistic about ourselves,
131.331	we're optimistic about our kids,
133.149	we're optimistic about our families,
134.937	but we're not so optimistic about the guy sitting next to us,
138.12	and we're somewhat pessimistic
140.349	about the fate of our fellow citizens and the fate of our country.
144.228	But private optimism about our own personal future
148.264	remains persistent.
150.275	And it doesn't mean that we think things will magically turn out okay,
154.341	but rather that we have the unique ability to make it so.
158.373	Now I'm a scientist, I do experiments.
161.214	So to show you what I mean,
163.006	I'm going to do an experiment here with you.
165.808	So I'm going to give you a list of abilities and characteristics,
169.658	and I want you to think for each of these abilities
172.552	where you stand relative to the rest of the population.
176.945	The first one is getting along well with others.
180.731	Who here believes they're at the bottom 25 percent?
186.383	Okay, that's about 10 people out of 1,500.
190.705	Who believes they're at the top 25 percent?
194.718	That's most of us here.
197.428	Okay, now do the same for your driving ability.
202.358	How interesting are you?
204.941	How attractive are you?
207.785	How honest are you?
210.739	And finally, how modest are you?
215.739	So most of us put ourselves above average
218.427	on most of these abilities.
220.456	Now this is statistically impossible.
222.587	We can't all be better than everyone else.
225.816	(Laughter)
227.458	But if we believe we're better than the other guy,
230.135	well that means that we're more likely to get that promotion, to remain married,
234.218	because we're more social, more interesting.
236.816	And it's a global phenomenon.
238.979	The optimism bias has been observed
241.447	in many different countries --
243.166	in Western cultures, in non-Western cultures,
246.27	in females and males,
247.776	in kids, in the elderly.
249.5	It's quite widespread.
251.283	But the question is, is it good for us?
254.783	So some people say no.
257.237	Some people say the secret to happiness
259.755	is low expectations.
262.508	I think the logic goes something like this:
265.012	If we don't expect greatness,
267.27	if we don't expect to find love and be healthy and successful,
271.15	well we're not going to be disappointed when these things don't happen.
274.248	And if we're not disappointed when good things don't happen,
277.656	and we're pleasantly surprised when they do,
279.635	we will be happy.
281.416	So it's a very good theory,
283.118	but it turns out to be wrong for three reasons.
286.145	Number one: Whatever happens, whether you succeed or you fail,
290.76	people with high expectations always feel better.
294.618	Because how we feel when we get dumped or win employee of the month
298.55	depends on how we interpret that event.
301.58	The psychologists Margaret Marshall and John Brown
305.63	studied students with high and low expectations.
308.624	And they found that when people with high expectations succeed,
312.808	they attribute that success to their own traits.
315.718	"""I'm a genius, therefore I got an A,"
317.914	"therefore I'll get an A again and again in the future."""
320.589	When they failed, it wasn't because they were dumb,
323.562	but because the exam just happened to be unfair.
326.735	Next time they will do better.
329.018	People with low expectations do the opposite.
332.095	So when they failed it was because they were dumb,
334.927	and when they succeeded
336.427	it was because the exam just happened to be really easy.
339.744	Next time reality would catch up with them.
342.145	So they felt worse.
344.218	Number two: Regardless of the outcome,
347.458	the pure act of anticipation makes us happy.
351.505	The behavioral economist George Lowenstein
354.681	asked students in his university
356.4	to imagine getting a passionate kiss from a celebrity, any celebrity.
360.762	"Then he said, ""How much are you willing to pay"
363.647	to get a kiss from a celebrity
365.635	if the kiss was delivered immediately,
367.862	in three hours, in 24 hours, in three days,
372.885	in one year, in 10 years?
375.318	He found that the students were willing to pay the most
378.448	not to get a kiss immediately,
380.447	but to get a kiss in three days.
383.427	They were willing to pay extra in order to wait.
387.674	Now they weren't willing to wait a year or 10 years;
390.677	no one wants an aging celebrity.
392.098	But three days seemed to be the optimum amount.
396.887	So why is that?
399.19	Well if you get the kiss now, it's over and done with.
402.614	But if you get the kiss in three days,
404.564	well that's three days of jittery anticipation, the thrill of the wait.
408.718	The students wanted that time
410.587	to imagine where is it going to happen,
412.968	how is it going to happen.
414.597	Anticipation made them happy.
416.808	This is, by the way, why people prefer Friday to Sunday.
420.677	It's a really curious fact,
422.76	because Friday is a day of work and Sunday is a day of pleasure,
426.177	so you'd assume that people will prefer Sunday,
429.081	but they don't.
430.802	It's not because they really, really like being in the office
433.677	and they can't stand strolling in the park
435.644	or having a lazy brunch.
437.305	We know that, because when you ask people
439.441	about their ultimate favorite day of the week,
442.145	surprise, surprise, Saturday comes in at first,
444.965	then Friday, then Sunday.
447.885	People prefer Friday
449.754	because Friday brings with it the anticipation of the weekend ahead,
453.718	all the plans that you have.
455.635	On Sunday, the only thing you can look forward to
458.339	is the work week.
460.593	So optimists are people who expect more kisses in their future,
465.47	more strolls in the park.
467.391	And that anticipation enhances their wellbeing.
471.298	In fact, without the optimism bias,
474.262	we would all be slightly depressed.
477.012	People with mild depression,
479.279	they don't have a bias when they look into the future.
482.258	They're actually more realistic than healthy individuals.
486.48	But individuals with severe depression,
488.581	they have a pessimistic bias.
490.41	So they tend to expect the future
492.873	to be worse than it ends up being.
495.35	So optimism changes subjective reality.
498.593	The way we expect the world to be changes the way we see it.
502.343	But it also changes objective reality.
505.585	It acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy.
508.312	And that is the third reason
510.38	why lowering your expectations will not make you happy.
513.56	Controlled experiments have shown
515.395	that optimism is not only related to success,
518.312	it leads to success.
520.119	Optimism leads to success in academia and sports and politics.
524.989	And maybe the most surprising benefit of optimism is health.
529.464	If we expect the future to be bright,
532.789	stress and anxiety are reduced.
535.529	So all in all, optimism has lots of benefits.
539.749	But the question that was really confusing to me was,
542.76	how do we maintain optimism in the face of reality?
547.429	As an neuroscientist, this was especially confusing,
550.447	because according to all the theories out there,
553.343	when your expectations are not met, you should alter them.
557.531	But this is not what we find.
559.083	We asked people to come into our lab
562.566	in order to try and figure out what was going on.
565.376	We asked them to estimate their likelihood
567.923	of experiencing different terrible events in their lives.
570.427	So, for example, what is your likelihood of suffering from cancer?
574.802	And then we told them the average likelihood
577.154	of someone like them to suffer these misfortunes.
580.135	So cancer, for example, is about 30 percent.
583.7	And then we asked them again,
586.635	"""How likely are you to suffer from cancer?"""
589.51	What we wanted to know was
591.758	whether people will take the information that we gave them
594.427	to change their beliefs.
596.558	And indeed they did --
598.927	but mostly when the information we gave them
601.508	was better than what they expected.
604.339	So for example,
605.7	"if someone said, ""My likelihood of suffering from cancer"
608.61	"is about 50 percent,"""
610.991	"and we said, ""Hey, good news."
613.512	"The average likelihood is only 30 percent,"""
616.093	the next time around they would say,
618.139	"""Well maybe my likelihood is about 35 percent."""
620.854	So they learned quickly and efficiently.
623.49	But if someone started off saying,
626.04	"""My average likelihood of suffering from cancer is about 10 percent,"""
629.443	"and we said, ""Hey, bad news."
632.135	"The average likelihood is about 30 percent,"""
635.208	the next time around they would say,
637.266	"""Yep. Still think it's about 11 percent."""
640.385	(Laughter)
642.075	So it's not that they didn't learn at all -- they did --
645.394	but much, much less than when we gave them
647.73	positive information about the future.
650.203	And it's not that they didn't remember the numbers that we gave them;
653.237	everyone remembers that the average likelihood of cancer
656.31	is about 30 percent
657.81	and the average likelihood of divorce is about 40 percent.
660.589	But they didn't think that those numbers were related to them.
665.22	What this means is that warning signs such as these
669.368	may only have limited impact.
672.26	Yes, smoking kills, but mostly it kills the other guy.
676.419	What I wanted to know was
678.302	what was going on inside the human brain
681.162	that prevented us from taking these warning signs personally.
685.256	But at the same time,
686.743	when we hear that the housing market is hopeful,
688.721	"we think, ""Oh, my house is definitely going to double in price."""
692.837	To try and figure that out,
694.922	I asked the participants in the experiment
697.395	to lie in a brain imaging scanner.
699.556	It looks like this.
701.083	And using a method called functional MRI,
704.114	we were able to identify regions in the brain
707.72	that were responding to positive information.
710.537	One of these regions is called the left inferior frontal gyrus.
714.116	"So if someone said, ""My likelihood of suffering from cancer is 50 percent,"""
717.904	"and we said, ""Hey, good news."
719.76	"Average likelihood is 30 percent,"""
722.05	the left inferior frontal gyrus would respond fiercely.
725.622	And it didn't matter if you're an extreme optimist, a mild optimist
730.354	or slightly pessimistic,
732.175	everyone's left inferior frontal gyrus
734.76	was functioning perfectly well,
736.604	whether you're Barack Obama or Woody Allen.
739.51	On the other side of the brain,
741.154	the right inferior frontal gyrus was responding to bad news.
745.94	And here's the thing: it wasn't doing a very good job.
749.666	The more optimistic you were,
751.681	the less likely this region was
754.018	to respond to unexpected negative information.
757	And if your brain is failing
760.058	at integrating bad news about the future,
763.283	you will constantly leave your rose-tinted spectacles on.
767.906	So we wanted to know, could we change this?
772.875	Could we alter people's optimism bias
776.318	by interfering with the brain activity in these regions?
780.25	And there's a way for us to do that.
782.845	This is my collaborator Ryota Kanai.
785.472	And what he's doing is he's passing a small magnetic pulse
789.427	through the skull of the participant in our study
791.546	into their inferior frontal gyrus.
793.791	And by doing that,
795.718	he's interfering with the activity of this brain region
798.622	for about half an hour.
799.837	After that everything goes back to normal, I assure you.
802.758	(Laughter)
804.751	So let's see what happens.
807.905	First of all, I'm going to show you
810.002	the average amount of bias that we see.
812.706	So if I was to test all of you now,
815.529	this is the amount that you would learn
817.323	more from good news relative to bad news.
820.443	Now we interfere with the region
822.927	that we found to integrate negative information in this task,
827.394	and the optimism bias grew even larger.
830.958	We made people more biased in the way that they process information.
836.428	Then we interfered with the brain region
839.325	that we found to integrate good news in this task,
842.843	and the optimism bias disappeared.
847.314	We were quite amazed by these results
849.322	because we were able to eliminate
851.514	a deep-rooted bias in humans.
854.71	And at this point we stopped and we asked ourselves,
859.483	would we want to shatter the optimism illusion into tiny little bits?
864.585	If we could do that, would we want to take people's optimism bias away?
869.629	Well I've already told you about all of the benefits of the optimism bias,
874.229	which probably makes you want to hold onto it for dear life.
878.55	But there are, of course, pitfalls,
880.635	and it would be really foolish of us to ignore them.
883.755	Take for example this email I recieved
887.301	from a firefighter here in California.
889.995	"He says, ""Fatality investigations for firefighters"
893.299	often include 'We didn't think the fire was going to do that,'
897.441	even when all of the available information
899.743	"was there to make safe decisions."""
901.998	This captain is going to use our findings on the optimism bias
905.872	to try to explain to the firefighters
908.064	why they think the way they do,
910.273	to make them acutely aware of this very optimistic bias in humans.
917.399	So unrealistic optimism can lead to risky behavior,
922.518	to financial collapse, to faulty planning.
926.156	The British government, for example,
928.294	has acknowledged that the optimism bias
930.968	can make individuals more likely
934.255	to underestimate the costs and durations of projects.
938.281	So they have adjusted the 2012 Olympic budget
942.535	for the optimism bias.
944.646	My friend who's getting married in a few weeks
946.833	has done the same for his wedding budget.
949.267	And by the way, when I asked him about his own likelihood of divorce,
952.329	he said he was quite sure it was zero percent.
955.889	So what we would really like to do,
958.306	is we would like to protect ourselves from the dangers of optimism,
962.467	but at the same time remain hopeful,
965.695	benefiting from the many fruits of optimism.
968.539	And I believe there's a way for us to do that.
971.343	The key here really is knowledge.
973.403	We're not born with an innate understanding of our biases.
976.714	These have to be identified by scientific investigation.
980.555	But the good news is that becoming aware of the optimism bias
984.739	does not shatter the illusion.
986.514	It's like visual illusions,
988.062	in which understanding them does not make them go away.
991.552	And this is good because it means
993.789	we should be able to strike a balance,
996.262	to come up with plans and rules
998.689	to protect ourselves from unrealistic optimism,
1001.472	but at the same time remain hopeful.
1004.624	I think this cartoon portrays it nicely.
1008.048	Because if you're one of these pessimistic penguins up there
1011.574	who just does not believe they can fly,
1013.693	you certainly never will.
1016.052	Because to make any kind of progress,
1017.883	we need to be able to imagine a different reality,
1020.233	and then we need to believe that that reality is possible.
1023.974	But if you are an extreme optimistic penguin
1027.498	who just jumps down blindly hoping for the best,
1030.26	you might find yourself in a bit of a mess when you hit the ground.
1035.041	But if you're an optimistic penguin
1036.93	who believes they can fly,
1038.726	but then adjusts a parachute to your back
1041.389	just in case things don't work out exactly as you had planned,
1044.406	you will soar like an eagle,
1046.269	even if you're just a penguin.
1049.318	Thank you.
1051.08	(Applause)
