16.079	So I'm a woman with chronic schizophrenia.
18.03	I've spent hundreds of days
19.839	in psychiatric hospitals.
21.326	I might have ended up spending
23.131	most of my life on the back ward of a hospital,
24.958	but that isn't how my life turned out.
27.158	In fact, I've managed to stay clear of hospitals
30.606	for almost three decades,
32.095	perhaps my proudest accomplishment.
34.038	That's not to say that I've remained clear
36.232	of all psychiatric struggles.
37.839	After I graduated from the Yale Law School and
40.264	got my first law job, my New Haven analyst, Dr. White,
43.27	announced to me that he was going to close his practice
45.855	in three months, several years
47.735	before I had planned to leave New Haven.
49.432	White had been enormously helpful to me,
52.201	and the thought of his leaving
53.258	shattered me.
55.144	My best friend Steve,
56.614	sensing that something was terribly wrong,
58.366	flew out to New Haven to be with me.
60.198	Now I'm going to quote from some of my writings:
62.286	"""I opened the door to my studio apartment."
64.801	Steve would later tell me that,
66.974	for all the times he had seen me psychotic, nothing
69.71	could have prepared him for what he saw that day.
71.711	For a week or more, I had barely eaten.
74.384	I was gaunt. I walked
76.944	as though my legs were wooden.
78.558	My face looked and felt like a mask.
81.585	I had closed all the curtains in the apartment, so
84.429	in the middle of the day
85.384	the apartment was in near total darkness.
87.398	The air was fetid, the room a shambles.
90.15	Steve, both a lawyer and a psychologist, has treated
93.466	many patients with severe mental illness, and to this day
96.599	he'll say I was as bad as any he had ever seen.
99.287	'Hi,' I said, and then I returned to the couch,
102.366	where I sat in silence for several moments.
104.49	'Thank you for coming, Steve.
106.335	Crumbling world, word, voice.
110.386	Tell the clocks to stop.
112.255	Time is. Time has come.'
114.046	'White is leaving,' Steve said somberly.
117.287	'I'm being pushed into a grave. The situation is grave,' I moan.
120.718	'Gravity is pulling me down.
122.345	"I'm scared. Tell them to get away.'"""
124.478	As a young woman, I was in a psychiatric hospital
128.19	on three different occasions for lengthy periods.
130.694	My doctors diagnosed me with chronic schizophrenia,
133.486	"and gave me a prognosis of ""grave."""
136.081	That is, at best, I was expected to live in a board and care,
139.511	and work at menial jobs.
141.215	Fortunately, I did not actually
143.215	enact that grave prognosis.
144.99	Instead, I'm a chaired Professor of Law, Psychology
147.831	and Psychiatry at the USC Gould School of Law,
150.456	I have many close friends
152.086	and I have a beloved husband, Will, who's here with us today.
155.271	(Applause) Thank you.
161.814	He's definitely the star of my show.
165.072	I'd like to share with you how that happened, and also
167.87	describe my experience of being psychotic.
170.639	I hasten to add that it's my experience,
173.119	because everyone becomes psychotic in his or her own way.
175.775	Let's start with the definition of schizophrenia.
178.836	Schizophrenia is a brain disease.
181.057	Its defining feature is psychosis, or being
183.482	out of touch with reality.
185.074	Delusions and hallucinations
186.896	are hallmarks of the illness.
188.45	Delusions are fixed and false beliefs that aren't responsive
191.202	to evidence, and hallucinations are false sensory experiences.
195.018	For example, when I'm psychotic I often have
197.368	the delusion that I've killed hundreds of thousands
199.619	of people with my thoughts.
201.196	I sometimes have the idea that
202.901	nuclear explosions are about to be set off in my brain.
205.396	Occasionally, I have hallucinations,
207.732	like one time I turned around and saw a man
209.5	with a raised knife.
211.077	Imagine having a nightmare while you're awake.
213.869	Often, speech and thinking become disorganized
217.079	to the point of incoherence.
218.625	Loose associations involves putting together words
221.504	that may sound a lot alike but don't make sense,
224.287	"and if the words get jumbled up enough, it's called ""word salad."""
226.677	Contrary to what many people think, schizophrenia is not
231.115	the same as multiple personality disorder or split personality.
234.53	The schizophrenic mind is not split, but shattered.
238.081	Everyone has seen a street person,
240.66	unkempt, probably ill-fed,
242.683	standing outside of an office building muttering
245.26	to himself or shouting.
247.073	This person is likely to have some form of schizophrenia.
249.67	But schizophrenia presents itself across a wide array
252.001	of socioeconomic status, and there are people
254.825	with the illness who are full-time professionals
257.355	with major responsibilities.
259.707	Several years ago, I decided
260.918	to write down my experiences and my personal journey,
264.353	and I want to share some more of that story with you today
266.651	to convey the inside view.
268.314	So the following episode happened the seventh week
271.099	of my first semester of my first year at Yale Law School.
273.962	Quoting from my writings:
276.167	"""My two classmates, Rebel and Val, and I had made the date"
279.636	to meet in the law school library on Friday night
282.597	to work on our memo assignment together.
284.881	But we didn't get far before I was talking in ways
286.683	that made no sense.
288.206	'Memos are visitations,' I informed them.
291.27	'They make certain points. The point is on your head.
293.79	Pat used to say that. Have you killed you anyone?'
296.245	Rebel and Val looked at me
298.261	as if they or I had been
299.932	splashed in the face with cold water.
301.512	'What are you talking about, Elyn?'
303.068	'Oh, you know, the usual. Who's what, what's who,
306.077	heaven and hell. Let's go out on the roof.
308.332	It's a flat surface. It's safe.'
309.908	Rebel and Val followed
311.492	and they asked what had gotten into me.
312.941	'This is the real me,' I announced,
314.804	waving my arms above my head.
316.349	And then, late on a Friday night, on the roof
319.124	of the Yale Law School,
320.281	I began to sing, and not quietly either.
322.573	'Come to the Florida sunshine bush.
325.677	Do you want to dance?'
326.988	'Are you on drugs?' one asked. 'Are you high?'
329.463	'High? Me? No way, no drugs.
331.919	Come to the Florida sunshine bush,
334.486	where there are lemons, where they make demons.'
337.759	'You're frightening me,' one of them said, and Rebel and Val
340.453	headed back into the library.
342.232	I shrugged and followed them.
344.349	Back inside, I asked my classmates if they were
347.716	having the same experience of words jumping around
349.933	our cases as I was.
351.277	'I think someone's infiltrated my copies of the cases,' I said.
355.3	'We've got to case the joint.
356.804	I don't believe in joints, but
358.387	"they do hold your body together.'"" --"
359.852	It's an example of loose associations. --
362.221	"""Eventually I made my way back to my dorm room,"
364.605	and once there, I couldn't settle down.
366.964	My head was too full of noise,
368.789	too full of orange trees and law memos I could not write
372.476	and mass murders I knew I would be responsible for.
375.108	Sitting on my bed, I rocked back and forth,
378.453	"moaning in fear and isolation."""
380.485	This episode led to my first hospitalization in America.
383.612	I had two earlier in England.
385.852	Continuing with the writings:
387.413	"""The next morning I went to my professor's office to ask"
389.877	for an extension on the memo assignment,
391.454	and I began gibbering unintelligably
393.611	as I had the night before,
394.957	and he eventually brought me to the emergency room.
396.63	Once there, someone I'll just call 'The Doctor'
400.431	and his whole team of goons swooped down,
402.398	lifted me high into the air,
403.807	and slammed me down on a metal bed
405.48	with such force that I saw stars.
407.832	Then they strapped my legs and arms to the metal bed
410.39	with thick leather straps.
412.057	A sound came out of my mouth that I'd never heard before:
415.403	half groan, half scream,
417.431	barely human and pure terror.
420.775	Then the sound came again,
422.446	forced from somewhere deep inside my belly
424.37	"and scraping my throat raw."""
425.967	This incident resulted in my involuntary hospitalization.
430.246	One of the reasons the doctors gave for hospitalizing me
433.787	against my will was that I was
435.072	"""gravely disabled."""
436.479	To support this view, they wrote in my chart that I was unable
439.575	to do my Yale Law School homework.
441.367	I wondered what that meant about much of the rest of New Haven.
444.408	(Laughter)
446.014	During the next year, I would
448.703	spend five months in a psychiatric hospital.
450.855	At times, I spent up to 20 hours in mechanical restraints,
454.334	arms tied, arms and legs tied down,
457.824	arms and legs tied down with a net tied
460.343	tightly across my chest.
462.151	I never struck anyone.
464.198	I never harmed anyone. I never made any direct threats.
467.104	If you've never been restrained yourself, you may have
469.878	a benign image of the experience.
472.575	There's nothing benign about it.
474.55	Every week in the United States,
476.335	it's been estimated that one to three people die in restraints.
479.255	They strangle, they aspirate their vomit,
481.871	they suffocate, they have a heart attack.
484.024	It's unclear whether using mechanical restraints
486.55	is actually saving lives or costing lives.
489.07	While I was preparing to write my student note
491.864	for the Yale Law Journal on mechanical restraints,
494.064	I consulted an eminent law professor who was also
496.416	a psychiatrist,
497.501	and said surely he would agree
499.214	that restraints must be degrading,
501.51	painful and frightening.
503.046	He looked at me in a knowing way, and said,
505.157	"""Elyn, you don't really understand:"
507.486	These people are psychotic.
509.224	They're different from me and you.
510.745	"They wouldn't experience restraints as we would."""
513.509	I didn't have the courage to tell him in that moment that,
516.343	no, we're not that different from him.
518.344	We don't like to be strapped down to a bed
520.702	and left to suffer for hours any more than he would.
523.032	In fact, until very recently,
525.184	and I'm sure some people still hold it as a view,
527.166	that restraints help psychiatric patients feel safe.
530.198	I've never met a psychiatric patient
532.63	who agreed with that view.
534.024	Today, I'd like to say I'm very pro-psychiatry
536.735	but very anti-force.
538.238	I don't think force is effective as treatment, and I think
541.229	using force is a terrible thing to do to another person
543.966	with a terrible illness.
545.325	Eventually, I came to Los Angeles
548.046	to teach at the University of Southern California Law School.
550.544	For years, I had resisted medication,
552.864	making many, many efforts to get off.
554.854	I felt that if I could manage without medication,
557.529	I could prove that, after all,
559.567	I wasn't really mentally ill, it was some terrible mistake.
562.317	My motto was the less medicine, the less defective.
565.624	My L.A. analyst, Dr. Kaplan, was urging me
568.712	just to stay on medication and get on with my life,
571.212	but I decided I wanted to make one last college try to get off.
574.687	Quoting from the text:
576.119	"""I started the reduction of my meds, and within a short time"
579.759	I began feeling the effects.
581.871	After returning from a trip to Oxford, I marched into
584.712	Kaplan's office, headed straight for the corner, crouched down,
588.089	covered my face, and began shaking.
590.322	All around me I sensed evil beings poised with daggers.
593.477	They'd slice me up in thin slices
595.645	or make me swallow hot coals.
597.287	Kaplan would later describe me as 'writhing in agony.'
600.664	Even in this state, what he accurately described as
603.749	acutely and forwardly psychotic,
605.44	I refused to take more medication.
607.453	The mission is not yet complete.
610.253	Immediately after the appointment with Kaplan,
612.871	I went to see Dr. Marder, a schizophrenia expert
615.169	who was following me for medication side effects.
617.477	He was under the impression that I had a mild psychotic illness.
620.498	Once in his office, I sat on his couch, folded over,
623.926	and began muttering.
625.565	'Head explosions and people trying to kill.
627.795	Is it okay if I totally trash your office?'
630.26	'You need to leave if you think you're going to do that,'
632.892	said Marder.
633.875	'Okay. Small. Fire on ice. Tell them not to kill me.
637.027	Tell them not to kill me. What have I done wrong?
638.675	Hundreds of thousands with thoughts, interdiction.'
641.252	'Elyn, do you feel like you're
642.987	dangerous to yourself or others?
644.484	I think you need to be in the hospital.
646.899	I could get you admitted right away, and the whole thing
648.756	could be very discrete.'
649.891	'Ha, ha, ha.
651.572	You're offering to put me in hospitals?
653.909	Hospitals are bad, they're mad, they're sad.
656.852	"One must stay away. I'm God, or I used to be.'"""
660.516	At that point in the text,
662.099	"where I said ""I'm God, or I used to be,"" my husband"
664.004	made a marginal note.
665.029	"He said, ""Did you quit or were you fired?"""
666.636	(Laughter)
668.867	"""'I give life and I take it away."
672.619	Forgive me, for I know not what I do.'
674.316	Eventually, I broke down in front of friends, and
677.63	everybody convinced me to take more medication.
680.138	I could no longer deny the truth,
682.084	and I could not change it.
683.606	The wall that kept me, Elyn, Professor Saks,
686.255	separate from that insane woman hospitalized years past,
689.368	"lay smashed and in ruins."""
691.479	Everything about this illness says I shouldn't be here,
694.152	but I am. And I am, I think, for three reasons:
697.026	First, I've had excellent treatment.
699.418	Four- to five-day-a-week psychoanalytic psychotherapy
702.364	for decades and continuing, and excellent psychopharmacology.
705.348	Second, I have many close family members and friends who know me
709.392	and know my illness.
710.646	These relationships have given my life a meaning
712.97	and a depth, and they also helped me navigate
715.137	my life in the face of symptoms.
717.105	Third, I work at an enormously supportive workplace
720.273	at USC Law School.
721.858	This is a place that not only accommodates my needs
724.883	but actually embraces them.
726.274	It's also a very intellectually stimulating place,
729.305	and occupying my mind with complex problems
731.897	has been my best and most powerful and most reliable
735.33	defense against my mental illness.
737.05	Even with all that — excellent treatment, wonderful family and
740.353	friends, supportive work environment —
742.269	I did not make my illness public
744.602	until relatively late in life,
746.035	and that's because the stigma against mental illness
748.554	is so powerful that I didn't feel safe with people knowing.
751.162	If you hear nothing else today,
753.578	"please hear this: There are not ""schizophrenics."""
757.012	There are people with schizophrenia, and these people
760.163	may be your spouse, they may be your child,
762.258	they may be your neighbor, they may be your friend,
764.682	they may be your coworker.
766.106	So let me share some final thoughts.
768.962	We need to invest more resources into research and treatment
772.394	of mental illness.
773.634	The better we understand these illnesses, the better
775.69	the treatments we can provide, and the better the treatments
777.898	we can provide, the more we can offer people care,
780.338	and not have to use force.
781.786	Also, we must stop criminalizing mental illness.
784.738	It's a national tragedy and scandal that the L.A. County Jail
788.786	is the biggest psychiatric facility in the United States.
791.428	American prisons and jails are filled with people who suffer
795.344	from severe mental illness, and many of them are there
797.828	because they never received adequate treatment.
799.805	I could have easily ended up there or on the streets myself.
803.234	A message to the entertainment industry and to the press:
806.458	On the whole, you've done a wonderful job fighting stigma
810.522	and prejudice of many kinds.
812.338	Please, continue to let us see characters in your movies,
815.338	your plays, your columns,
817.466	who suffer with severe mental illness.
819.29	Portray them sympathetically,
821.05	and portray them in all the richness and depth
823.689	of their experience as people and not as diagnoses.
827.216	Recently, a friend posed a question:
829.492	If there were a pill I could take
831.267	that would instantly cure me, would I take it?
833.078	The poet Rainer Maria Rilke
835.771	was offered psychoanalysis.
837.243	"He declined, saying, ""Don't take my devils away,"
839.555	"because my angels may flee too."""
841.314	My psychosis, on the other hand,
843.507	is a waking nightmare in which my devils are so terrifying
846.179	that all my angels have already fled.
848.115	So would I take the pill? In an instant.
852.019	That said, I don't wish to be seen as regretting
854.7	the life I could have had if I'd not been mentally ill,
857.093	nor am I asking anyone for their pity.
859.375	What I rather wish to say is that the humanity we all share
862.521	is more important than the mental illness we may not.
865.139	What those of us who suffer with mental illness want
867.597	is what everybody wants:
869.051	"in the words of Sigmund Freud, ""to work and to love."""
871.585	Thank you. (Applause)
874.608	(Applause)
875.285	Thank you. Thank you. You're very kind. (Applause)
880.078	Thank you. (Applause)
