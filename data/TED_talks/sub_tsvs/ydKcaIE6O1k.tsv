13.395	I'd like to start with a simple question:
17.82	Why do the poor make
17.82	so many poor decisions?
23.672	I know it's a harsh question,
25.247	but take a look at the data.
27.236	The poor borrow more, save less,
29.103	smoke more, exercise less, drink more
31.786	and eat less healthfully.
34.192	Why?
36.271	Well, the standard explanation
37.822	was once summed up by the British
37.822	Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.
41.226	And she called poverty
41.226	"""a personality defect."""
44.635	(Laughter)
46.499	A lack of character, basically.
49.285	Now, I'm sure not many of you
49.285	would be so blunt.
54.317	But the idea that there's something
54.317	wrong with the poor themselves
58.191	is not restricted to Mrs. Thatcher.
61.105	Some of you may believe that the poor
61.105	should be held responsible
64.332	for their own mistakes.
66.109	And others may argue that we should
66.109	help them to make better decisions.
70.674	But the underlying assumption is the same:
74.47	there's something wrong with them.
77.877	If we could just change them,
79.759	if we could just teach them
79.759	how to live their lives,
82.275	if they would only listen.
85.053	And to be honest,
86.774	this was what I thought for a long time.
90.898	It was only a few years ago
90.898	that I discovered
93.036	that everything I thought I knew
93.036	about poverty was wrong.
98.106	It all started when I accidentally
98.106	stumbled upon a paper
100.781	by a few American psychologists.
102.413	They had traveled 8,000 miles,
102.413	all the way to India,
104.99	for a fascinating study.
107.065	And it was an experiment
107.065	with sugarcane farmers.
110.658	You should know that these farmers
110.658	collect about 60 percent
114.03	of their annual income all at once,
116.187	right after the harvest.
117.919	This means that they're relatively
117.919	poor one part of the year
121.483	and rich the other.
124.415	The researchers asked them to do
124.415	an IQ test before and after the harvest.
129.722	What they subsequently discovered
129.722	completely blew my mind.
134.979	The farmers scored much worse
134.979	on the test before the harvest.
140.277	The effects of living
140.277	in poverty, it turns out,
142.601	correspond to losing 14 points of IQ.
145.993	Now, to give you an idea,
147.886	that's comparable
147.886	to losing a night's sleep
150.351	or the effects of alcoholism.
154.505	A few months later,
154.505	I heard that Eldar Shafir,
156.788	a professor at Princeton University
156.788	and one of the authors of this study,
160.359	was coming over to Holland, where I live.
162.702	So we met up in Amsterdam
164.128	to talk about his revolutionary
164.128	new theory of poverty.
168.21	And I can sum it up in just two words:
171.235	scarcity mentality.
174.467	It turns out that people
174.467	behave differently
176.645	when they perceive a thing to be scarce.
179.155	And what that thing is
179.155	doesn't much matter --
181.394	whether it's not enough time,
181.394	money or food.
184.9	You all know this feeling,
186.582	when you've got too much to do,
188.569	or when you've put off breaking for lunch
190.609	and your blood sugar takes a dive.
192.296	This narrows your focus
192.296	to your immediate lack --
195.148	to the sandwich you've got to have now,
197.182	the meeting that's starting
197.182	in five minutes
199.468	or the bills that have
199.468	to be paid tomorrow.
202.868	So the long-term perspective
202.868	goes out the window.
207.655	You could compare it to a new computer
210.21	that's running 10 heavy programs at once.
213.021	It gets slower and slower, making errors.
215.818	Eventually, it freezes --
217.664	not because it's a bad computer,
219.794	but because it has too much to do at once.
223.279	The poor have the same problem.
226.654	They're not making dumb decisions
226.654	because they are dumb,
229.468	but because they're living in a context
231.414	in which anyone would make dumb decisions.
234.362	So suddenly I understood
237.334	why so many of our anti-poverty
237.334	programs don't work.
242.467	Investments in education, for example,
242.467	are often completely ineffective.
247.015	Poverty is not a lack of knowledge.
250.58	A recent analysis of 201 studies
253.159	on the effectiveness
253.159	of money-management training
255.495	came to the conclusion
255.495	that it has almost no effect at all.
259.268	Now, don't get me wrong --
260.737	this is not to say the poor
260.737	don't learn anything --
263.257	they can come out wiser for sure.
265.832	But it's not enough.
267.494	Or as Professor Shafir told me,
270.52	"""It's like teaching someone to swim"
272.528	"and then throwing them in a stormy sea."""
276.508	I still remember sitting there,
279.023	perplexed.
281.111	And it struck me
282.292	that we could have figured
282.292	this all out decades ago.
284.829	I mean, these psychologists didn't need
284.829	any complicated brain scans;
288.104	they only had to measure the farmer's IQ,
290.137	and IQ tests were invented
290.137	more than 100 years ago.
293.039	Actually, I realized I had read about
293.039	the psychology of poverty before.
297.367	George Orwell, one of the greatest
297.367	writers who ever lived,
301.065	experienced poverty
301.065	firsthand in the 1920s.
304.676	"""The essence of poverty,"""
304.676	he wrote back then,
306.878	"is that it ""annihilates the future."""
310.967	And he marveled at, quote,
313.746	"""How people take it for granted"
313.746	they have the right to preach at you
317.056	and pray over you
318.231	as soon as your income falls
318.231	"below a certain level."""
320.727	Now, those words are every bit
320.727	as resonant today.
326.965	The big question is, of course:
328.97	What can be done?
330.334	Modern economists have
330.334	a few solutions up their sleeves.
333.153	We could help the poor
333.153	with their paperwork
335.236	or send them a text message
335.236	to remind them to pay their bills.
338.242	This type of solution is hugely popular
338.242	with modern politicians,
342.973	mostly because,
344.7	well, they cost next to nothing.
347.955	These solutions are, I think,
347.955	a symbol of this era
351.989	in which we so often treat the symptoms,
354.19	but ignore the underlying cause.
357.494	So I wonder:
359.606	Why don't we just change the context
359.606	in which the poor live?
363.545	Or, going back to our computer analogy:
365.694	Why keep tinkering around
365.694	with the software
367.855	when we can easily solve the problem
367.855	by installing some extra memory instead?
371.944	At that point, Professor Shafir
371.944	responded with a blank look.
376.112	And after a few seconds, he said,
378.742	"""Oh, I get it."
381.48	You mean you want to just hand out
381.48	more money to the poor
385.964	to eradicate poverty.
387.839	Uh, sure, that'd be great.
391.734	But I'm afraid that brand
391.734	of left-wing politics
394.059	you've got in Amsterdam --
395.927	"it doesn't exist in the States."""
398.342	But is this really
398.342	an old-fashioned, leftist idea?
403.214	I remembered reading about an old plan --
405.225	something that has been proposed
405.225	by some of history's leading thinkers.
408.733	The philosopher Thomas More
408.733	"first hinted at it in his book, ""Utopia,"""
412.573	more than 500 years ago.
415.025	And its proponents have spanned
415.025	the spectrum from the left to the right,
418.599	from the civil rights campaigner,
418.599	Martin Luther King,
421.393	to the economist Milton Friedman.
425.093	And it's an incredibly simple idea:
429.063	basic income guarantee.
433.285	What it is?
434.824	Well, that's easy.
436.547	It's a monthly grant, enough to pay
436.547	for your basic needs:
439.302	food, shelter, education.
441.503	It's completely unconditional,
443.348	so no one's going to tell you
443.348	what you have to do for it,
446.132	and no one's going to tell you
446.132	what you have to do with it.
448.974	The basic income
448.974	is not a favor, but a right.
451.288	There's absolutely no stigma attached.
454.192	So as I learned about the true
454.192	nature of poverty,
456.846	I couldn't stop wondering:
459.028	Is this the idea
459.028	we've all been waiting for?
462.518	Could it really be that simple?
466.168	And in the three years that followed,
467.992	I read everything I could find
467.992	about basic income.
470.554	I researched the dozens of experiments
472.515	that have been conducted
472.515	all over the globe,
474.66	and it didn't take long before I stumbled
474.66	upon a story of a town
477.752	that had done it --
477.752	had actually eradicated poverty.
480.248	But then ...
482.298	nearly everyone forgot about it.
485.406	This story starts in Dauphin, Canada.
488.871	In 1974, everybody in this small town
488.871	was guaranteed a basic income,
494.475	ensuring that no one fell
494.475	below the poverty line.
497.234	At the start of the experiment,
498.854	an army of researchers
498.854	descended on the town.
503.187	For four years, all went well.
506.331	But then a new government
506.331	was voted into power,
509.787	and the new Canadian cabinet saw
509.787	little point to the expensive experiment.
513.321	So when it became clear there was
513.321	no money left to analyze the results,
517.598	the researchers decided to pack
517.598	their files away in some 2,000 boxes.
523.995	Twenty-five years went by,
526.809	and then Evelyn Forget,
526.809	a Canadian professor,
529.521	found the records.
530.761	For three years, she subjected the data
530.761	to all manner of statistical analysis,
534.752	and no matter what she tried,
536.362	the results were the same every time:
539.788	the experiment had been
539.788	a resounding success.
545.131	Evelyn Forget discovered
546.315	that the people in Dauphin
546.315	had not only become richer
548.923	but also smarter and healthier.
550.478	The school performance of kids
550.478	improved substantially.
554.976	The hospitalization rate decreased
554.976	by as much as 8.5 percent.
559.942	Domestic violence incidents were down,
561.776	as were mental health complaints.
563.973	And people didn't quit their jobs.
566.329	The only ones who worked a little less
566.329	were new mothers and students --
570.087	who stayed in school longer.
572.708	Similar results have since been found
574.607	in countless other experiments
574.607	around the globe,
577.027	from the US to India.
581.433	So ...
583.5	here's what I've learned.
585.815	When it comes to poverty,
587.995	we, the rich, should stop
587.995	pretending we know best.
594.031	We should stop sending shoes
594.031	and teddy bears to the poor,
596.809	to people we have never met.
598.354	And we should get rid of the vast
598.354	industry of paternalistic bureaucrats
601.911	when we could simply
601.911	hand over their salaries
604.116	to the poor they're supposed to help.
605.946	(Applause)
608.266	Because, I mean, the great
608.266	thing about money
611.163	is that people can use it
611.163	to buy things they need
613.538	instead of things that self-appointed
613.538	experts think they need.
617.702	Just imagine how many brilliant scientists
617.702	and entrepreneurs and writers,
622.13	like George Orwell,
623.305	are now withering away in scarcity.
626.119	Imagine how much energy
626.119	and talent we would unleash
628.599	if we got rid of poverty once and for all.
631.362	I believe that a basic income would work
631.362	like venture capital for the people.
636.913	And we can't afford not to do it,
638.981	because poverty is hugely expensive.
642.366	Just look at the cost of child poverty
642.366	in the US, for example.
645.782	It's estimated at 500 billion
645.782	dollars each year,
650.038	in terms of higher health care
650.038	spending, higher dropout rates,
653.01	and more crime.
654.417	Now, this is an incredible waste
654.417	of human potential.
660.185	But let's talk about
660.185	the elephant in the room.
663.146	How could we ever afford
663.146	a basic income guarantee?
666.872	Well, it's actually a lot cheaper
666.872	than you may think.
669.995	What they did in Dauphin is finance it
669.995	with a negative income tax.
673.583	This means that your income is topped up
675.615	as soon as you fall
675.615	below the poverty line.
678.051	And in that scenario,
679.437	according to our economists'
679.437	best estimates,
681.975	for a net cost of 175 billion --
685.024	a quarter of US military spending,
685.024	one percent of GDP --
689.955	you could lift all impoverished Americans
689.955	above the poverty line.
694.386	You could actually eradicate poverty.
697.962	Now, that should be our goal.
700.536	(Applause)
701.644	The time for small thoughts
701.644	and little nudges is past.
704.6	I really believe that the time has come
704.6	for radical new ideas,
707.932	and basic income is so much more
707.932	than just another policy.
711.156	It is also a complete rethink
711.156	of what work actually is.
715.818	And in that sense,
717.512	it will not only free the poor,
720.352	but also the rest of us.
723.081	Nowadays, millions of people feel
725.351	that their jobs have little
725.351	meaning or significance.
727.881	A recent poll among 230,000 employees
730.722	in 142 countries
732.652	found that only 13 percent of workers
732.652	actually like their job.
738.42	And another poll found that as much
738.42	as 37 percent of British workers
742.111	have a job that they think
742.111	doesn't even need to exist.
746.207	"It's like Brad Pitt says in ""Fight Club,"""
748.525	"""Too often we're working jobs we hate"
748.525	"so we can buy shit we don't need."""
752.205	(Laughter)
753.707	Now, don't get me wrong --
755.128	I'm not talking about the teachers
755.128	and the garbagemen
757.706	and the care workers here.
759.212	If they stopped working,
760.85	we'd be in trouble.
762.81	I'm talking about all those well-paid
762.81	professionals with excellent résumés
766.459	who earn their money doing ...
768.288	strategic transactor peer-to-peer meetings
770.348	while brainstorming the value
770.348	add-on of disruptive co-creation
773.404	in the network society.
774.601	(Laughter)
775.648	(Applause)
776.69	Or something like that.
777.916	Just imagine again how much
777.916	talent we're wasting,
780.864	simply because we tell our kids
780.864	"they'll have to ""earn a living."""
785.458	Or think of what a math whiz working
785.458	at Facebook lamented a few years ago:
789.224	"""The best minds of my generation"
791.11	are thinking about how
791.11	"to make people click ads."""
796.519	I'm a historian.
798.812	And if history teaches us anything,
800.905	it is that things could be different.
803.721	There is nothing inevitable
805.136	about the way we structured our society
805.136	and economy right now.
808.117	Ideas can and do change the world.
810.497	And I think that especially
810.497	in the past few years,
813.032	it has become abundantly clear
814.485	that we cannot stick to the status quo --
816.462	that we need new ideas.
820.319	I know that many of you
820.319	may feel pessimistic
823.556	about a future of rising inequality,
825.643	xenophobia
826.944	and climate change.
828.806	But it's not enough
828.806	to know what we're against.
831.048	We also need to be for something.
832.684	Martin Luther King didn't say,
832.684	"""I have a nightmare."""
835.242	(Laughter)
837.139	He had a dream.
838.322	(Applause)
839.425	So ...
841.655	here's my dream:
844.123	I believe in a future
845.785	where the value of your work
845.785	is not determined
848.162	by the size of your paycheck,
849.663	but by the amount of happiness you spread
851.719	and the amount of meaning you give.
853.72	I believe in a future
854.976	where the point of education is not
854.976	to prepare you for another useless job
858.66	but for a life well-lived.
861.024	I believe in a future
862.327	where an existence
862.327	without poverty is not a privilege
865.445	but a right we all deserve.
867.482	So here we are.
868.971	Here we are.
870.146	We've got the research,
870.146	we've got the evidence
872.36	and we've got the means.
873.547	Now, more than 500 years after Thomas More
873.547	first wrote about a basic income,
877.48	and 100 years after George Orwell
877.48	discovered the true nature of poverty,
881.559	we all need to change our worldview,
884.024	because poverty
884.024	is not a lack of character.
887.652	Poverty is a lack of cash.
891.141	Thank you.
892.349	(Applause)
