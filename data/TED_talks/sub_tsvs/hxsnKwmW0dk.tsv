14.014	When I think about dreams,
16	like many of you,
17.9	I think about this picture.
20.838	I was eight when I watched Neil Armstrong
24.899	step off the Lunar Module
24.899	onto the surface of the Moon.
29.454	I had never seen anything like it before,
32.708	and I've never seen
32.708	anything like it since.
36.319	We got to the Moon for one simple reason:
40.637	John Kennedy committed us to a deadline.
44.978	And in the absence of that deadline,
47.494	we would still be dreaming about it.
51.209	Leonard Bernstein said two things
51.209	are necessary for great achievement:
55.901	a plan and not quite enough time.
59.39	(Laughter)
63.851	Deadlines and commitments
68.369	are the great and fading
68.369	lessons of Apollo.
74.514	And they are what give the word
74.514	"""moonshot"" its meaning."
79.498	And our world is in desperate need
79.498	of political leaders
84.244	willing to set bold deadlines
88.053	for the achievement of daring dreams
88.053	on the scale of Apollo again.
94.368	When I think about dreams,
95.885	I think about the drag queens
95.885	of LA and Stonewall
99.958	and millions of other people
99.958	risking everything
102.331	to come out when that
102.331	was really dangerous,
105.667	and of this picture of the White House
105.667	lit up in rainbow colors,
109.412	yes --
110.594	(Applause) --
116.397	celebrating America's gay and lesbian
116.397	citizens' right to marry.
119.909	It is a picture that in my wildest dreams
119.909	I could never have imagined
124.18	when I was 18
126.932	and figuring out that I was gay
129.956	and feeling estranged from my country
133.647	and my dreams because of it.
137.956	I think about this picture of my family
141.234	that I never dreamed I could ever have --
145.281	(Applause) --
151.141	and of our children holding this headline
154.091	I never dreamed could ever be printed
154.091	about the Supreme Court ruling.
160.517	We need more of the courage
160.517	of drag queens and astronauts.
166.319	(Laughter)
168.669	(Applause)
171.366	But I want to talk
171.366	about the need for us to dream
174.732	in more than one dimension,
176.842	because there was something about Apollo
176.842	that I didn't know when I was 8,
182.272	and something about organizing
182.272	that the rainbow colors over.
187.699	Of the 30 astronauts in the original
187.699	Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs,
192.802	only seven marriages survived.
197.699	Those iconic images of the astronauts
197.699	bouncing on the Moon
201.498	obscure the alcoholism
201.498	and depression on Earth.
206.907	Thomas Merton, the Trappist monk,
209.541	asked during the time of Apollo,
211.98	"""What can we gain by sailing to the moon"
215.92	if we are not able to cross the abyss
215.92	"that separates us from ourselves?"""
223.561	And what can we gain by the right to marry
226.396	if we are not able to cross the acrimony
229.563	and emotional distance
229.563	that so often separates us from our love?
234.596	And not just in marriage.
237.12	I have seen the most hurtful, destructive,
244.231	tragic infighting in LGBT and AIDS
248.453	and breast cancer and non-profit activism,
251.873	all in the name of love.
254.898	Thomas Merton also wrote
254.898	about wars among saints
259.639	"and that ""there is a pervasive form"
259.639	of contemporary violence
265.692	to which the idealist
265.692	most easily succumbs:
270.065	activism and overwork.
273.414	The frenzy of our activism
273.414	neutralizes our work for peace.
278.215	It destroys our own
278.215	"inner capacity for peace."""
284.041	Too often our dreams become
284.041	these compartmentalized fixations
289.526	on some future
291.383	that destroy our ability to be present
291.383	for our lives right now.
296.926	Our dreams of a better life
296.926	for some future humanity
300.665	or some other humanity in another country
302.949	alienate us from the beautiful
302.949	human beings sitting next to us
306.997	at this very moment.
310.481	Well, that's just the price
310.481	of progress, we say.
313.664	You can go to the Moon
315.101	or you can have stability
315.101	in your family life.
319.679	And we can't conceive of dreaming
319.679	in both dimensions at the same time.
324.012	And we don't set the bar
324.012	much higher than stability
327.801	when it comes to our emotional life.
330.579	Which is why our technology
330.579	for talking to one another
333.939	has gone vertical,
336.332	our ability to listen
336.332	and understand one another
340.062	has gone nowhere.
343.236	Our access to information
343.236	is through the roof,
347.665	our access to joy, grounded.
353.442	But this idea, that our present
353.442	and our future are mutually exclusive,
359.338	that to fulfill our potential for doing
359.338	we have to surrender
363.358	our profound potential for being,
366.545	that the number of transistors
366.545	on a circuit can be doubled and doubled,
370.48	but our capacity for compassion
370.48	and humanity and serenity and love
374.806	is somehow limited
376.908	is a false and suffocating choice.
382.237	Now, I'm not suggesting
384.073	simply the uninspiring idea
384.073	of more work-life balance.
391.541	What good is it for me to spend
391.541	more time with my kids at home
394.478	if my mind is always somewhere else
394.478	while I'm doing it?
398.6	I'm not even talking about mindfulness.
400.589	Mindfulness is all of a sudden becoming
400.589	a tool for improving productivity.
405.973	(Laughter)
408.314	Right?
409.49	I'm talking about dreaming
412.458	as boldly in the dimension of our being
417.243	as we do about industry and technology.
419.751	I'm talking about
419.751	an audacious authenticity
424.536	that allows us to cry with one another,
428.298	a heroic humility that allows us
428.298	to remove our masks and be real.
433.85	It is our inability
433.85	to be with one another,
436.399	our fear of crying with one another,
436.399	that gives rise to so many
440.757	of the problems we are frantically
440.757	trying to solve in the first place,
444.075	from Congressional gridlock
444.075	to economic inhumanity.
448.097	(Applause)
451.388	I'm talking about what Jonas Salk
451.388	called an Epoch B,
455.459	a new epoch in which we become
455.459	as excited about and curious about
461.094	and scientific about
461.094	the development of our humanity
465.127	as we are about the development
465.127	of our technology.
469.341	We should not shrink from this opportunity
471.826	simply because
471.826	we don't really understand it.
475.357	There was a time
475.357	when we didn't understand space.
478.722	Or because we're more used
478.722	to technology and activism.
482.174	That is the very definition
482.174	of being stuck in a comfort zone.
485.469	We are now very comfortable imagining
485.469	unimaginable technological achievement.
491.842	In 2016, it is the dimension
491.842	of our being itself
496.017	that cries out for its fair share
496.017	of our imagination.
503.782	Now, we're all here to dream,
506.131	but maybe if we're honest about it,
507.823	each of us chasing our own dream.
510.536	You know, looking at the name tags
510.536	to see who can help me with my dream,
514.33	sometimes looking right through
514.33	one another's humanity.
517.45	I can't be bothered with you right now.
517.45	I have an idea for saving the world.
521.513	Right?
522.689	(Laughter)
525.83	Years ago, once upon a time,
525.83	I had this beautiful company
530.33	that created these long journeys
530.33	for heroic civic engagement.
534.647	And we had this mantra:
536.718	"""Human. Kind. Be Both."""
541.139	And we encouraged people to experiment
541.139	outrageously with kindness.
547.599	"Like, ""Go help everybody"
547.599	"set up their tents."""
551.4	And there were a lot of tents.
553.995	(Laughter)
556.043	"""Go buy everybody Popsicles."""
557.79	"""Go help people fix their flat tires"
559.695	even though you know
559.695	"the dinner line is going to get longer."""
562.645	And people really took us up on this,
565.043	so much so that if you got
565.043	a flat tire on the AIDS ride,
567.694	you had trouble fixing it, because there
567.694	were so many people there asking you
571.345	if you needed help.
573.345	For a few days,
573.345	for tens of thousands of people,
577.378	we created these worlds
579.316	that everybody said were the way
579.316	they wish the world could always be.
586.316	What if we experimented
586.316	with creating that kind of world
590.847	these next few days?
594.156	And instead of going up to someone
594.156	"and asking them, ""What do you do?"""
599.195	"ask them, ""So what are your dreams?"""
602.315	"or ""What are your broken dreams?"""
605.346	"You know, ""TED."""
605.346	Tend to Each other's Dreams.
610.83	(Applause)
615.623	"Maybe it's ""I want to stay sober"""
618.203	"or ""I want to build"
618.203	"a tree house with my kid."""
621.512	You know, instead of going up
621.512	to the person everybody wants to meet,
624.728	go up to the person who is all alone
626.509	and ask them if they want
626.509	to grab a cup of coffee.
630.544	I think what we fear most
633.044	is that we will be denied the opportunity
633.044	to fulfill our true potential,
637.424	that we are born to dream
640.059	and we might die
640.059	without ever having the chance.
645.63	Imagine living in a world
647.282	where we simply recognize
647.282	that deep, existential fear in one another
653.503	and love one another boldly
653.503	because we know
656.659	that to be human
656.659	is to live with that fear.
661.793	It's time for us to dream
661.793	in multiple dimensions simultaneously,
668.262	and somewhere that transcends
668.262	all of the wondrous things
672.254	we can and will and must do
676.881	lies the domain of all
676.881	the unbelievable things we could be.
683.748	It's time we set foot into that dimension
687.23	and came out about the fact
687.23	that we have dreams there, too.
693.214	If the Moon could dream,
698.039	I think that would be its dream for us.
703.54	It's an honor to be with you.
705.203	Thank you very much.
707.136	(Applause)
