26	Walk around for four months with three wishes,
30	and all the ideas will start to percolate up.
32	I think everybody should do it -- think that you've got three wishes.
34	And what would you do? It's actually a great exercise
36	to really drill down to the things that you feel are important,
41	and really reflect on the world around us.
44	And thinking that, can an individual actually do something,
48	or come up with something,
50	that may actually get some traction out there and make a difference?
54	Inspired by nature -- that's the theme here.
58	And I think, quite frankly, that's where I started.
63	I became very interested in the landscape as a Canadian.
68	We have this Great North. And there was a pretty small population,
71	and my father was an avid outdoorsman.
73	So I really had a chance to experience that.
76	And I could never really understand exactly what it was, or how it was informing me.
80	But what I think it was telling me
82	is that we are this transient thing that's happening,
87	and that the nature that you see out there -- the untouched shorelines,
91	the untouched forest that I was able to see --
94	really bring in a sense of that geological time,
101	that this has gone on for a long time,
103	and we're experiencing it in a different way.
106	And that, to me, was a reference point that I think I needed to have
112	to be able to make the work that I did.
114	And I did go out, and I did this picture of grasses coming through in the spring,
119	along a roadside.
121	This rebirth of grass. And then I went out for years
124	trying to photograph the pristine landscape.
127	But as a fine-art photographer I somehow felt
130	that it wouldn't catch on out there,
132	that there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fine-art career.
136	And I kept being sucked into this genre of the calendar picture,
141	or something of that nature, and I couldn't get away from it.
143	So I started to think of, how can I rethink the landscape?
147	I decided to rethink the landscape
149	as the landscape that we've transformed.
152	I had a bit of an epiphany being lost in Pennsylvania,
154	and I took a left turn trying to get back to the highway.
158	And I ended up in a town called Frackville.
160	I got out of the car, and I stood up,
162	and it was a coal-mining town. I did a 360 turnaround,
166	and that became one of the most surreal landscapes I've ever seen.
170	Totally transformed by man.
173	And that got me to go out and look at mines like this,
176	and go out and look at the largest industrial incursions
179	in the landscape that I could find.
181	And that became the baseline of what I was doing.
184	And it also became the theme that I felt that I could hold onto,
189	and not have to re-invent myself --
191	that this theme was large enough to become a life's work,
194	to become something that I could sink my teeth into
198	and just research and find out where these industries are.
202	And I think one of the things I also wanted to say in my thanks,
205	which I kind of missed,
207	was to thank all the corporations who helped me get in.
210	Because it took negotiation for almost every one of these photographs --
214	to get into that place to make those photographs,
218	and if it wasn't for those people letting me in
221	at the heads of those corporations,
223	I would have never made this body of work.
225	So in that respect, to me, I'm not against the corporation.
230	I own a corporation. I work with them,
233	and I feel that we all need them and they're important.
236	But I am also for sustainability.
238	So there's this thing that is pulling me in both directions.
241	And I'm not making an indictment towards what's happening here,
245	but it is a slow progression.
247	So I started thinking, well, we live in all these ages of man:
250	the Stone Age, and the Iron Age, and the Copper Age.
254	And these ages of man are still at work today.
258	But we've become totally disconnected from them.
260	There's something that we're not seeing there.
263	And it's a scary thing as well. Because when we start looking
267	at the collective appetite for our lifestyles,
270	and what we're doing to that landscape --
273	that, to me, is something that is a very sobering moment for me to contemplate.
279	And through my photographs,
281	I'm hoping to be able to engage the audiences of my work,
287	and to come up to it and not immediately be rejected by the image.
290	"Not to say, ""Oh my God, what is it?"" but to be challenged by it --"
293	"to say, ""Wow, this is beautiful,"" on one level,"
295	"but on the other level, ""This is scary. I shouldn't be enjoying it."""
299	Like a forbidden pleasure. And it's that forbidden pleasure
302	that I think is what resonates out there,
304	and it gets people to look at these things,
306	and it gets people to enter it. And it also, in a way, defines kind of what I feel, too --
313	that I'm drawn to have a good life.
316	I want a house, and I want a car.
318	But there's this consequence out there.
320	And how do I begin to have that attraction, repulsion?
323	It's even in my own conscience I'm having it,
326	and here in my work, I'm trying to build that same toggle.
330	These things that I photographed -- this tire pile here
333	had 45 million tires in it. It was the largest one.
336	It was only about an hour-and-a-half away from me, and it caught fire
339	about four years ago. It's around Westley, California, around Modesto.
343	And I decided to start looking at something that, to me, had --
347	if the earlier work of looking at the landscape
349	had a sense of lament to what we were doing to nature,
352	in the recycling work that you're seeing here
355	was starting to point to a direction. To me, it was our redemption.
359	That in the recycling work that I was doing,
361	I'm looking for a practice, a human activity that is sustainable.
368	That if we keep putting things, through industrial and urban existence,
373	back into the system --
375	if we keep doing that -- we can continue on.
378	Of course, listening at the conference,
380	there's many, many things that are coming. Bio-mimicry,
383	and there's many other things that are coming on stream --
385	nanotechnology that may also prevent us from having
390	to go into that landscape and tear it apart.
393	And we all look forward to those things.
395	But in the meantime, these things are scaling up.
397	These things are continuing to happen.
399	What you're looking at here -- I went to Bangladesh,
402	so I started to move away from North America;
405	I started to look at our world globally.
407	These images of Bangladesh
409	came out of a radio program I was listening to.
412	They were talking about Exxon Valdez,
415	and that there was going to be a glut of oil tankers
417	because of the insurance industries.
419	And that those oil tankers needed to be decommissioned,
421	and 2004 was going to be the pinnacle.
423	"And I thought, ""My God, wouldn't that be something?"""
425	To see the largest vessels of man being deconstructed by hand,
429	literally, in third-world countries.
431	So originally I was going to go to India.
433	And I was shut out of India because of a Greenpeace situation there,
436	and then I was able to get into Bangladesh,
438	and saw for the first time a third world, a view of it,
443	that I had never actually thought was possible.
450	people everywhere -- the pollution was intense,
453	and the working conditions were horrible.
456	Here you're looking at some oil fields in California,
458	some of the biggest oil fields. And again, I started to think that --
463	there was another epiphany --
466	that the whole world I was living in was
468	a result of having plentiful oil.
471	And that, to me, was again something that I started building on,
475	and I continued to build on.
477	So this is a series I'm hoping to have ready
481	in about two or three years,
483	"under the heading of ""The Oil Party."""
485	Because I think everything that we're involved in --
487	our clothing, our cars, our roads, and everything -- are directly a result.
491	I'm going to move to some pictures of China.
496	And for me China -- I started photographing it four years ago,
499	and China truly is a question of sustainability in my mind,
502	not to mention that China, as well,
505	has a great effect on the industries that I grew up around.
508	I came out of a blue-collar town,
510	a GM town, and my father worked at GM,
513	so I was very familiar with that kind of industry
517	and that also informed my work. But you know,
522	to see China and the scale at which it's evolving, is quite something.
528	So what you see here is the Three Gorges Dam,
531	and this is the largest dam by 50 percent ever attempted by man.
536	Most of the engineers around the world left the project
540	"because they said, ""It's just too big."""
542	In fact, when it did actually fill with water a year and a half ago,
546	they were able to measure a wobble within the earth as it was spinning.
549	It took fifteen days to fill it.
551	So this created a reservoir 600 kilometers long,
556	one of the largest reservoirs ever created.
558	And what was also one of the bigger projects around that
563	was moving 13 full-size cities up out of the reservoir,
567	and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships.
570	"This is a ""before and after."" So that was before."
574	And this is like 10 weeks later, demolished by hand.
577	I think 11 of the buildings they used dynamite,
579	everything else was by hand. That was 10 weeks later.
581	And this gives you an idea.
583	And it was all the people who lived in those homes,
586	were the ones that were actually taking it apart
588	and working, and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart.
593	And these are some of the images from that.
595	So I spent about three trips to the Three Gorges Dam,
598	looking at that massive transformation of a landscape.
602	And it looks like a bombed-out landscape, but it isn't.
605	What it is, it's a landscape that is an intentional one.
609	This is a need for power, and they're willing to go through this
614	massive transformation, on this scale, to get that power.
621	And again, it's actually a relief for what's going on in China
627	because I think on the table right now,
629	there's 27 nuclear power stations to be built.
632	There hasn't been one built in North America for 20 years
634	"because of the ""NIMBY"" problem -- ""Not In My BackYard."""
636	"But in China they're saying, ""No, we're putting in 27 in the next 10 years."""
639	And coal-burning furnaces are going in there
643	for hydroelectric power literally weekly.
646	So coal itself is probably one of the largest problems.
651	And one of the other things that happened in the Three Gorges --
653	a lot of the agricultural land that you see there on the left was also lost;
658	some of the most fertile agricultural land was lost in that.
661	And 1.2 to 2 million people were relocated,
664	depending on whose statistics you're looking at.
667	And this is what they were building.
669	This is Wushan, one of the largest cities that was relocated.
673	This is the town hall for the city.
676	And again, the rebuilding of the city -- to me, it was sad to see
681	that they didn't really grab a lot of, I guess,
683	what we know here, in terms of urban planning.
686	There were no parks; there were no green spaces.
689	Very high-density living on the side of a hill.
692	And here they had a chance to rebuild cities from the bottom up,
695	but somehow were not connecting with them.
698	"Here is a sign that, translated, says, ""Obey the birth control law."
703	"Build our science, civilized and advanced idea of marriage and giving birth."""
707	So here, if you look at this poster,
710	it has all the trappings of Western culture.
713	You're seeing the tuxedos, the bouquets.
717	But what's really, to me, frightening about the picture
720	and about this billboard is the refinery in the background.
723	So it's like marrying up all the things that we have
726	and it's an adaptation of our way of life, full stop.
732	And again, when you start seeing that kind of embrace,
738	and you start looking at them leading their rural lifestyle
742	with a very, very small footprint and moving into an urban lifestyle
747	with a much higher footprint, it starts to become very sobering.
750	This is a shot in one of the biggest squares in Guangdong --
753	and this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country.
758	And there's about 130 million people in migration
761	trying to get into urban centers at all times,
763	and in the next 10 to 15 years, are expecting
767	another 400 to 500 million people to migrate
770	into the urban centers like Shanghai and the manufacturing centers.
775	The manufacturers are --
777	the domestics are usually -- you can tell a domestic factory by the fact
781	that they all use the same color uniforms.
784	So this is a pink uniform at this factory. It's a shoe factory.
787	And they have dorms for the workers.
789	So they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dorms.
792	This is one of the biggest shoe factories, the Yuyuan shoe factory
796	near Shenzhen. It has 90,000 employees making shoes.
801	This is a shift change, one of three.
804	There's two factories of this scale in the same town.
807	This is one with 45,000, so every lunch,
810	there's about 12,000 coming through for lunch.
812	They sit down; they have about 20 minutes.
814	The next round comes in. It's an incredible workforce
817	that's building there. Shanghai --
820	I'm looking at the urban renewal in Shanghai,
823	and this is a whole area that will be flattened
825	and turned into skyscrapers in the next five years.
830	What's also happening in Shanghai is --
832	China is changing because this wouldn't have happened
836	five years ago, for instance. This is a holdout.
838	They're called dengzahoos -- they're like pin tacks to the ground.
841	They won't move. They're not negotiating.
843	They're not getting enough, so they're not going to move.
846	And so they're holding off until they get a deal with them.
849	And they've been actually quite successful in getting better deals
852	because most of them are getting a raw deal.
854	They're being put out about two hours --
856	the communities that have been around for literally hundreds of years,
859	or maybe even thousands of years,
861	are being broken up and spread across in the suburban areas
864	outside of Shanghai. But these are a whole series of guys
867	holding out in this reconstruction of Shanghai.
872	Probably the largest urban-renewal project, I think,
876	ever attempted on the planet.
879	And then the embrace of the things that they're replacing it with --
882	again, one of my wishes, and I never ended up going there,
885	was to somehow tell them that there were better ways to build a house.
888	The kinds of collisions of styles and things were quite something,
894	and these are called the villas.
898	And also, like right now, they're just moving.
901	The scaffolding is still on, and this is an e-waste area,
905	and if you looked in the foreground on the big print,
907	you'd see that the industry -- their industry -- they're all recycling.
910	So the industry's already growing
912	around these new developments.
915	This is a five-level bridge in Shanghai.
917	Shanghai was a very intriguing city -- it's exploding on a level
923	that I don't think any city has experienced.
927	In fact, even Shenzhen, the economic zone --
932	one of the first ones -- 15 years ago was about 100,000 people,
937	and today it boasts about 10 to 11 million.
940	So that gives you an idea of the kinds of migrations and the speed with which --
945	this is just the taxis being built by Volkswagen.
948	There's 9,000 of them here,
951	and they're being built for most of the big cities,
955	Beijing and Shanghai, Shenzhen.
958	And this isn't even the domestic car market; this is the taxi market.
967	And what we would see here as a suburban development --
972	a similar thing, but they're all high-rises.
975	So they'll put 20 or 40 up at a time,
977	and they just go up in the same way
979	as a single-family dwelling would go up here in an area.
986	And the density is quite incredible.
989	And one of the things in this picture that I wanted to point out
996	is that when I saw these kinds of buildings,
999	I was shocked to see
1001	that they're not using a central air-conditioning system;
1005	every window has an air conditioner in it.
1008	And I'm sure there are people here who probably
1011	know better than I do about efficiencies,
1013	but I can't imagine that every apartment having its own air conditioner
1017	is a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale.
1019	And when you start looking at that,
1021	and then you start factoring up into a city the size of Shanghai,
1026	it's literally a forest of skyscrapers.
1029	It's breathtaking, in terms of the speed at which this city is transforming.
1035	And you can see in the foreground of this picture,
1037	it's still one of the last areas that was being held up.
1040	Right now that's all cleared out -- this was done about eight months ago --
1043	and high-rises are now going up into that central spot.
1046	So a skyscraper is built, literally, overnight in Shanghai.
1055	Most recently I went in, and I started looking
1057	at some of the biggest industries in China.
1060	And this is Baosteel, right outside of Shanghai.
1064	This is the coal supply for the steel factory -- 18 square kilometers.
1069	It's an incredibly massive operation, I think 15,000 workers,
1076	five cupolas, and the sixth one's coming in here.
1080	So they're building very large blast furnaces
1085	to try to deal with the demand for steel in China.
1089	So this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot.
1094	And again, looking at these images, there's this constant, like, haze that you're seeing.
1100	This is going to show you, real time, an assembler. It's a circuit breaker.
1133	I think one of the issues
1139	that we here are facing with China,
1144	is that they're using a lot of the latest production technology.
1147	In that one, there were 400 people that worked on the floor.
1150	And I asked the manager to point out five of your fastest producers,
1155	and then I went and looked at each one of them for about 15 or 20 minutes,
1159	and picked this one woman.
1161	And it was just lightning fast;
1163	the way she was working was almost unbelievable.
1165	But that is the trick that they've got right now,
1168	that they're winning with, is that they're using
1171	all the latest technologies and extrusion machines,
1173	and bringing all the components into play,
1177	but the assembly is where they're actually bringing in --
1180	the country workers are very willing to work. They want to work.
1185	There's a massive backlog of people wanting their jobs.
1189	That condition's going to be there for the next 10 to 15 years
1192	if they realize what they want, which is, you know,
1198	In this particular case -- this is the assembly line that you saw;
1201	this is a shot of it.
1202	I had to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field.
1205	I had to have them freeze for 10 seconds to get this shot.
1210	It took me five fake tries
1213	because they were just going. To slow them down was literally impossible.
1217	They were just wound up doing these things all day long,
1220	until the manager had to, with a stern voice, say,
1222	"""Okay, everybody freeze."""
1224	It wasn't too bad,
1227	but they're driven to produce these things at an incredible rate.
1233	This is a textile mill doing synthetic silk, an oil byproduct.
1240	And what you're seeing here is,
1242	again, one of the most state-of-the-art textile mills.
1246	There are 500 of these machines; they're worth about 200,000 dollars each.
1249	So you have about 12 people running this,
1251	and they're just inspecting it -- and they're just walking the lines.
1254	The machines are all running,
1256	absolutely incredible to see what the scale of industries are.
1259	And I started getting in further and further into the factories.
1264	And that's a diptych. I do a lot of pairings
1267	to try and get the sense of scale in these places.
1270	This is a line where they get the threads
1272	and they wind the threads together,
1274	pre-going into the textile mills.
1278	Here's something that's far more labor-intensive,
1280	which is the making of shoes.
1282	This floor has about 1,500 workers on this floor.
1287	The company itself had about 10,000 employees,
1291	and they're doing domestic shoes.
1294	It was very hard to get into the international companies
1297	because I had to get permission from companies like Nike and Adidas,
1301	and that's very hard to get.
1303	And they don't want to let me in.
1305	But the domestic was much easier to do.
1307	It just gives you a sense of, again -- and that's where,
1310	really, the whole migration of jobs started going over to China
1313	and making the shoes. Nike was one of the early ones.
1316	It was such a high labor component to it
1321	that it made a lot of sense to go after that labor market.
1324	This is a high-tech mobile phone: Bird mobile phone,
1328	one of the largest mobile makers in China.
1330	I think mobile phone companies
1333	are popping up, literally, on a weekly basis,
1337	and they have an explosive growth in mobile phones.
1341	This is a textile where they're doing shirts --
1345	Youngor, the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in China.
1348	And this next shot here is one of the lunchrooms.
1352	Everything is very efficient.
1354	While setting up this shot,
1356	people on average would spend eight to 10 minutes having a lunch.
1364	This was one of the biggest factories I've ever seen.
1366	They make coffeemakers here, the biggest coffeemaker
1371	and the biggest iron makers --
1375	they make 20 million of them in the world.
1377	There's 21,000 employees. This one factory -- and they had several of them --
1382	is half a kilometer long.
1384	These are just recently shot -- I just came back about a month ago,
1387	so you're the first ones to be seeing these,
1390	these new factory pictures I've taken.
1393	So it's taken me almost a year to gain access into these places.
1399	The other aspect of what's happening in China
1402	is that there's a real need for materials there.
1405	So a lot of the recycled materials that are collected here
1408	are being recycled and taken to China by ships.
1411	That's cubed metal. This is armatures, electrical armatures,
1415	where they're getting the copper and the high-end steel
1417	from electrical motors out, and recycling them.
1422	This is certainly connected to California and Silicon Valley.
1425	But this is what happens to most of the computers.
1428	Fifty percent of the world's computers end up in China to be recycled.
1432	"It's referred to as ""e-waste"" there."
1434	And it is a bit of a problem. The way they recycle the boards
1438	is that they actually use the coal briquettes,
1441	which are used all through China, but they heat up the boards,
1444	and with pairs of pliers they pull off all the components.
1447	They're trying to get all the valued metals out of those components.
1450	But the toxic smells -- when you come into a town
1453	that's actually doing this kind of burning of the boards,
1456	you can smell it a good five or 10 kilometers before you get there.
1459	Here's another operation. It's all cottage industries,
1462	so it's not big places -- it's all in people's front porches,
1467	in their backyards, even in their homes they're burning boards,
1473	if there's a concern for somebody coming by --
1476	because it is considered in China to be illegal, doing it,
1479	but they can't stop the product from coming in.
1483	This portrait -- I'm not usually known for portraits,
1486	but I couldn't resist this one, where she's been through Mao,
1490	and she's been through the Great Leap Forward,
1492	and the Cultural Revolution, and now she's sitting on her porch
1495	with this e-waste beside her. It's quite something.
1498	This is a road where it's been shored up by computer boards
1502	in one of the biggest towns where they're recycling.
1505	So that's the photographs that I wanted to show you.
1509	(Applause)
1511	I want to dedicate my wishes to my two girls.
1513	They've been sitting on my shoulder the whole time while I've been thinking.
1516	One's Megan, the one of the right, and Katja there.
1519	And to me the whole notion --
1521	the things I'm photographing are out of a great concern
1523	about the scale of our progress and what we call progress.
1528	And as much as there are great things around the corner --
1531	and it's palpable in this room --
1534	of all of the things that are just about to break
1536	that can solve so many problems,
1539	I'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world
1542	and will start to have a positive effect.
1545	And it isn't something that isn't just affecting our world,
1547	but it starts to go up -- because I think we can start correcting
1550	our footprint and bring it down -- but there's a growing footprint
1555	that's happening in Asia, and is growing at a rapid, rapid rate,
1559	and so I don't think we can equalize it. So ultimately the strategy,
1564	I think, here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution,
1568	because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well.
1572	So part of my thinking, and part of my wishes,
1575	is sitting with these thoughts in mind,
1578	and thinking about,
1580	"""How is their life going to be when they want to have children,"
1583	or when they're ready to get married 20 years from now -- or whatever,
1588	And to me that has been the core behind most of my thinking --
1591	in my work, and also for this incredible chance to have some wishes.
1599	Wish one: world-changing. I want to use my images
1603	to persuade millions of people to join in the global conversation on sustainability.
1608	And it is through communications today
1611	that I believe that that is not an unreal idea.
1615	Oh, and I went in search -- I wanted to put what I had in mind,
1619	hitch it onto something. I didn't want a wish just to start from nowhere.
1623	One of them I'm starting from almost nothing, but the other one,
1626	I wanted to find out what's going on that's working right now.
1629	And Worldchanging.com is a fantastic blog, and that blog
1637	is now being visited by close to half-a-million people a month.
1642	And it just started about 14 months ago.
1647	And the beauty of what's going on there
1649	is that the tone of the conversation is the tone that I like.
1655	What they're doing there is that they're not --
1658	I think the environmental movement has failed
1661	in that it's used the stick too much;
1663	it's used the apocalyptic tone too much;
1666	it hasn't sold the positive aspects of
1671	being environmentally concerned and trying to pull us out.
1674	Whereas this conversation that is going on in this blog
1677	is about positive movements,
1680	about how to change our world in a better way, quickly.
1683	And it's looking at technology, and it's looking at new energy-saving devices,
1688	and it's looking at how to rethink and how to re-strategize
1692	the movement towards sustainability.
1695	And so for me, one of the things that I thought
1699	would be to put some of my work in the service of promoting
1705	the Worldchanging.com website.
1708	Some of you might know, he's a TEDster -- Stephen Sagmeister and I
1713	are working on some layouts. And this is still in preliminary stages;
1717	these aren't the finals. But these images, with Worldchanging.com,
1723	can be placed into any kind of media.
1725	They could be posted through the Web;
1728	they could be used as a billboard or a bus shelter, or anything of that nature.
1735	So we're looking at this as trying to build out.
1739	And what we ended up discussing
1741	was that in most media you get mostly an image with a lot of text,
1746	and the text is blasted all over.
1748	What was unusual, according to Stephen,
1750	is less than five percent of ads are actually leading with image.
1755	And so in this case,
1757	because it's about a lot of these images and what they represent,
1760	and the kinds of questions they bring up,
1762	that we thought letting the images play out and bring someone to say,
1767	"""Well, what's Worldchanging.com, with these images, have to do?"""
1772	And hopefully inspire people to go to that website.
1776	So Worldchanging.com, and building that blog, and it is a blog,
1780	and I'm hoping that it isn't -- I don't see it as the kind of blog
1783	where we're all going to follow each other to death.
1785	This one is one that will spoke out, and will go out,
1788	and to start reaching. Because right now there's conversations
1791	in India, in China, in South America --
1793	there's entries coming from all around the world.
1796	I think there's a chance to have a dialogue, a conversation
1799	about sustainability at Worldchanging.com.
1802	And anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic.
1807	Wish two is more of the bottom-up, ground-up one that I'm trying to work with.
1810	And this one is: I wish to launch a groundbreaking competition
1814	that motivates kids to invest ideas on, and invent ideas on, sustainability.
1821	And one of the things that came out --
1823	Allison, who actually nominated me, said something earlier on
1826	in a brainstorming. She said that recycling in Canada
1829	had a fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six.
1837	And you think about it, you know,
1839	grade four -- my wife and I, we say age seven is the age of reason,
1843	so they're into the age of reason. And they're pre-puberty.
1847	So it's this great window where they actually are --
1849	you can influence them. You know what happens at puberty?
1852	You know, we know that from earlier presentations.
1855	So my thinking here is that we try to motivate those kids
1862	to start driving home ideas. Let them understand what sustainability is,
1866	and that they have a vested interest in it to happen.
1868	And one of the ways I thought of doing it is to use my prize,
1873	so I would take 30,000 or 40,000 dollars of the winnings,
1877	and the rest is going to be to manage this project,
1879	but to use that as prizes for kids to get into their hands.
1882	But the other thing that I thought would be fantastic
1884	"was to create these -- call them ""prize targets."""
1888	And so one could be for the best sustainable idea
1892	for an in-school project, the best one for a household project,
1897	or it could be the best community project for sustainability.
1900	And I also thought there should be a nice prize
1903	"for the best artwork for ""In My World."" And what would happen --"
1907	it's a scalable thing. And if we can get people to put in things --
1912	whether it's equipment, like a media lab,
1914	or money to make the prize significant enough --
1916	and to open it up to all the schools that are public schools,
1921	or schools that are with kids that age,
1923	and make it a wide-open competition for them
1926	to go after those prizes and to submit them.
1928	And the prize has to be a verifiable thing, so it's not about just ideas.
1933	The art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them
1936	and do them, but the actual things have to be verifiable.
1939	In that way, what's happening is that
1941	we're motivating a certain age group to start thinking.
1944	And they're going to push that up, from the bottom -- up into,
1949	I believe, into the households. And parents will be reacting to it,
1953	and trying to help them with the projects.
1955	And I think it starts to motivate the whole idea towards sustainability
1959	in a very positive way,
1961	and starts to teach them. They know about recycling now,
1964	but they don't really, I think, get sustainability in all the things,
1967	and the energy footprint, and how that matters.
1970	And to teach them, to me, would be a fantastic wish,
1974	and it would be something that I would certainly put my shoulder into.
1979	"And again, in ""In My World,"" the competition --"
1981	we would use the artwork that comes in from that competition to promote it.
1985	"And I like the words, ""in my world,"""
1987	because it gives possession of the world to the person who's doing it.
1990	It is my world; it's not someone else's. I want to help it;
1993	I want to do something with it. So I think it has a great opportunity
1998	to engage the imaginations -- and great ideas, I think, come from kids --
2003	and engage their imagination into a project,
2005	and do something for schools.
2007	I think all schools could use extra equipment, extra cash --
2010	it's going to be an incentive for them to do that.
2014	And these are some of the ideas in terms of where
2017	"we could possibly put in some promotion for ""In My World."""
2023	And wish three is: Imax film. So I was told I should do one for myself,
2029	and I've always wanted to actually get involved with doing something.
2033	And the scale of my work, and the kinds of ideas I'm playing with --
2036	when I first saw an Imax film, I almost immediately thought,
2039	"""There's a real resonance between what I'm trying to do"
2041	"and the scale of what I try to do as a photographer."""
2044	And I think there's a real possibility
2048	to reach new audiences if I had a chance.
2050	So I'm looking, really, for a mentor, because I just had my birthday.
2054	I'm 50, and I don't have time to go back to school right now --
2057	I'm too busy. So I need somebody
2059	who can put me on a quick catch-up course on how to do something like that,
2064	and lead me through the maze of how one does something like this.
2068	That would be fantastic. So those are my three wishes.
2071	(Applause)
