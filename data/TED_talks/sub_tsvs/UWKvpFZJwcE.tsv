12.231	So yesterday, I was out in the street
14.611	in front of this building,
17.287	and I was walking down the sidewalk,
20.323	and I had company, several of us,
22.183	and we were all abiding by the rules
23.681	of walking down sidewalks.
26.068	We're not talking each other. We're facing forward.
28.51	We're moving.
29.933	When the person in front of me slows down.
33.196	And so I'm watching him, and he slows down,
35.186	and finally he stops.
36.783	Well, that wasn't fast enough for me,
38.868	so I put on my turn signal, and I walked around him,
42.547	and as I walked, I looked to see what he was doing,
45.28	and he was doing this.
47.848	He was texting,
49.792	and he couldn't text and walk at the same time.
51.814	Now we could approach this
53.623	from a working memory perspective
55.515	or from a multitasking perspective.
57.5	We're going to do working memory today.
60.029	Now, working memory
62.169	is that part of our consciousness that we are
65.317	aware of at any given time of day.
67.771	You're going it right now.
69.413	It's not something we can turn off.
71.067	If you turn it off, that's called a coma, okay?
74.518	So right now, you're doing just fine.
77.621	Now working memory has four basic components.
79.977	It allows us to store some immediate experiences
82.574	and a little bit of knowledge.
84.19	It allows us to reach back
84.19	into our long-term memory
87.559	and pull some of that in as we need it,
89.409	mixes it, processes it
91.609	in light of whatever our current goal is.
93.903	Now the current goal isn't something like,
95.417	I want to be president or the best surfer in the world.
97.699	It's more mundane. I'd like that cookie,
100.502	or I need to figure out how to get into my hotel room.
103.104	Now working memory capacity
105.284	is our ability to leverage that,
107.89	our ability to take what we know
110.685	and what we can hang onto
111.961	and leverage it in ways that allow us to satisfy
115.56	our current goal.
117.31	Now working memory capacity
119.094	has a fairly long history,
121.147	and it's associated with a lot of positive effects.
123.346	People with high working memory capacity
125.734	tend to be good storytellers.
127.978	They tend to solve and do well
127.978	on standardized tests,
131.955	however important that is.
134.3	They're able to have high levels of writing ability.
138.083	They're also able to reason at high levels.
140.957	So what we're going to do here
140.957	is play a little bit with some of that.
143.875	So I'm going to ask you to perform a couple tasks,
146.425	and we're going to take your 
146.425	working memory out for a ride.
149.504	You up for that? Okay.
152.101	I'm going to give you five words,
154.299	and I just want you to hang on to them.
156.092	Don't write them down. Just hang on to them.
157.96	Five words.
159.372	While you're hanging on to them,
159.372	I'm going to ask you to answer three questions.
162.575	I want to see what happens with those words.
164.48	So here's the words:
166.327	tree,
169.615	highway,
172.55	mirror,
174.928	Saturn
177.06	and electrode.
179.479	So far so good?
181.063	Okay. What I want you to do
182.917	is I want you to tell me what the answer is
186.264	to 23 times eight.
188.586	Just shout it out.
192.766	(Mumbling) (Laughter)
196.468	In fact it's -- (Mumbling) -- exactly. (Laughter)
198.889	All right. I want you to take out your left hand
202.116	"and I want you to go, ""One, two, three, four, five,"
204.796	"six, seven, eight, nine, 10."""
206.999	It's a neurological test,
206.999	just in case you were wondering.
209.695	All right, now what I want you to do
211.56	is to recite the last five letters
213.785	of the English alphabet backwards.
218.637	You should have started with Z.
220.539	(Laughter)
223.83	All right. How many people here are still pretty sure
225.917	you've got all five words?
228.368	Okay. Typically we end up with about less than half,
231.549	right, which is normal. There will be a range.
233.624	Some people can hang on to five.
235.18	Some people can hang on to 10.
236.464	Some will be down to two or three.
238.769	What we know is this is really important
238.769	to the way we function, right?
242.173	And it's going to be really important here at TED
244.121	because you're going to be exposed
244.121	to so many different ideas.
247.157	Now the problem that we have
249.364	is that life comes at us,
251.076	and it comes at us very quickly,
253.193	and what we need to do is to take that amorphous
257.106	flow of experience and somehow
258.884	extract meaning from it
260.391	with a working memory
261.69	that's about the size of a pea.
263.959	Now don't get me wrong,
263.959	working memory is awesome.
266.506	Working memory allows us
268.621	to investigate our current experience
270.993	as we move forward.
272.488	It allows us to make sense of the world around us.
275.656	But it does have certain limits.
277.575	Now working memory is great
277.575	for allowing us to communicate.
281.418	We can have a conversation,
282.89	and I can build a narrative around that
285.577	so I know where we've been and where we're going
287.307	and how to contribute to this conversation.
289.395	It allows us to problem-solve, critical think.
291.632	We can be in the middle of a meeting,
293.436	listen to somebody's presentation, evaluate it,
295.939	decide whether or not we like it,
297.581	ask follow-up questions.
298.839	All of that occurs within working memory.
302.209	It also allows us to go to the store
304.056	and allows us to get milk and eggs and cheese
307.71	when what we're really looking for
309.481	is Red Bull and bacon. (Laughter)
312.318	Gotta make sure we're getting what we're looking for.
315.04	Now, a central issue with working memory
318.377	is that it's limited.
319.774	It's limited in capacity, limited in duration,
321.97	limited in focus.
323.58	We tend to remember about four things.
326.315	Okay? It used to be seven,
328.212	but with functional MRIs, apparently it's four,
330.236	and we were overachieving.
332.779	Now we can remember those four things
334.752	for about 10 to 20 seconds
336.615	unless we do something with it,
338.342	unless we process it,
338.342	unless we apply it to something,
340.855	unless we talk to somebody about it.
344.5	When we think about working memory,
347.742	we have to realize that this limited capacity
351.046	has lots of different impacts on us.
353.541	Have you ever walked from one room to another
356.566	and then forgotten why you're there?
359.577	You do know the solution to that, right?
361.746	You go back to that original room. (Laughter)
364.092	Have you ever forgotten your keys?
368.029	You ever forgotten your car?
370.558	You ever forgotten your kids?
373.529	Have you ever been involved in a conversation,
375.718	and you realize that the conversation to your left
377.662	is actually more interesting? (Laughter)
380.496	So you're nodding and you're smiling,
382.12	but you're really paying attention
382.12	to this one over here,
384.508	until you hear that last word go up,
386.808	and you realize,
388.468	you've been asked a question. (Laughter)
391.422	And you're really hoping the answer is no,
393.369	because that's what you're about to say.
396.588	All of that talks about working memory,
399.064	what we can do and what we can't do.
401.322	We need to realize that working memory
402.859	has a limited capacity,
404.258	and that working memory capacity itself
404.258	is how we negotiate that.
407.777	We negotiate that through strategies.
409.948	So what I want to do is talk a little bit
409.948	about a couple of strategies here,
412.269	and these will be really important
413.544	because you are now in an
413.544	information target-rich environment
417.299	for the next several days.
419.419	Now the first part of this that we need to think about
422.323	and we need to process our existence, our life,
425.09	immediately and repeatedly.
426.805	We need to process what's going on
429.246	the moment it happens, not 10 minutes later,
432.16	not a week later, at the moment.
434.429	So we need to think about, well,
434.429	do I agree with him?
438.162	What's missing? What would I like to know?
440.942	Do I agree with the assumptions?
443.164	How can I apply this in my life?
444.974	It's a way of processing what's going on
446.954	so that we can use it later.
448.721	Now we also need to repeat it. We need to practice.
451.681	So we need to think about it here.
454.093	In between, we want to talk to people about it.
456.888	We're going to write it down,
456.888	and when you get home,
459.111	pull out those notes and think about them
461.071	and end up practicing over time.
463.46	Practice for some reason
463.46	became a very negative thing.
466.011	It's very positive.
467.463	The next thing is, we need to think elaboratively
470.513	and we need to think illustratively.
472.853	Oftentimes, we think that we have to relate
472.853	new knowledge to prior knowledge.
476.307	What we want to do is spin that around.
478.237	We want to take all of our existence
479.994	and wrap it around that new knowledge
481.747	and make all of these connections
481.747	and it becomes more meaningful.
485.195	We also want to use imagery.
485.195	We are built for images.
488.989	We need to take advantage of that.
490.847	Think about things in images,
492.357	write things down that way.
494.706	If you read a book, pull things up.
496.268	"I just got through reading ""The Great Gatsby,"""
498.321	and I have a perfect idea of what he looks like
501.42	in my head, so my own version.
504.418	The last one is organization and support.
506.421	We are meaning-making machines. It's what we do.
508.99	We try to make meaning out of
508.99	everything that happens to us.
512.131	Organization helps, so we need to structure
514.421	what we're doing in ways that make sense.
516	If we are providing knowledge and experience,
518.586	we need to structure that.
520.071	And the last one is support.
522.57	We all started as novices.
524.292	Everything we do is an
524.292	approximation of sophistication.
527.333	We should expect it to change over time.
527.333	We have to support that.
530.27	The support may come in asking people questions,
532.926	giving them a sheet of paper that has
532.926	an organizational chart on it
536.429	or has some guiding images,
538.977	but we need to support it.
540.877	Now, the final piece of this, the take-home message
546.168	from a working memory capacity standpoint is this:
549.094	what we process, we learn.
552.025	If we're not processing life, we're not living it.
556.826	Live life. Thank you.
558.718	(Applause)
