15.485	America's public energy conversation
17.747	boils down to this question:
19.97	Would you rather die of A) oil wars,
23.35	or B) climate change,
25.96	or C) nuclear holocaust,
27.36	or D) all of the above?
30.66	Oh, I missed one: or E) none of the above?
33.46	That's the one we're not normally offered.
35.575	What if we could make energy do our work
37.714	without working our undoing?
40.16	Could we have fuel without fear?
42.26	Could we reinvent fire?
44.668	You see, fire made us human;
46.298	fossil fuels made us modern.
48.352	But now we need a new fire
49.652	that makes us safe, secure, healthy and durable.
53.175	Let's see how.
55.434	Four-fifths of the world's energy
58.32	still comes from burning each year
60.093	four cubic miles of the rotted remains
63.593	of primeval swamp goo.
66.193	Those fossil fuels
68.327	have built our civilization.
71.404	They've created our wealth.
73.489	They've enriched the lives of billions.
75.065	But they also have rising costs
77.704	to our security, economy, health and environment
82.093	that are starting to erode, if not outweigh their benefits.
85.347	So we need a new fire.
87.589	And switching from the old fire to the new fire
90.491	means changing two big stories about oil and electricity,
94.527	each of which puts two-fifths of the fossil carbon in the air.
99.204	But they're really quite distinct.
101.173	Less than one percent of our electricity is made from oil --
104.585	although almost half is made from coal.
108.289	Their uses are quite concentrated.
110.568	Three-fourths of our oil fuel is transportation.
113.308	Three-fourths of our electricity powers buildings.
116.083	And the rest of both runs factories.
118.124	So very efficient vehicles, buildings and factories
121.96	save oil and coal,
123.729	and also natural gas that can displace both of them.
127.16	But today's energy system is not just inefficient,
130.845	it is also disconnected,
132.852	aging, dirty and insecure.
135.56	So it needs refurbishment.
138.037	By 2050 though, it could become efficient,
141.465	connected and distributed
144.727	with elegantly frugal
146.127	autos, factories and buildings
148.86	all relying on a modern, secure
151.227	and resilient electricity system.
153.889	We can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by 2050
159.327	and use one-third less natural gas
162.496	while switching to efficient use
165.381	and renewable supply.
167.965	This could cost, by 2050,
171.498	five trillion dollars less in net present value,
174.75	that is expressed as a lump sum today,
177.393	than business as usual --
178.939	assuming that carbon emissions
180.393	and all other hidden or external costs are worth zero --
183.458	a conservatively low estimate.
187.342	Yet this cheaper energy system
189.293	could support 158 percent bigger U.S. economy
193.127	all without needing oil or coal,
195.496	or for that matter nuclear energy.
197.96	Moreover, this transition needs no new inventions
200.983	and no acts of Congress
204.245	and no new federal taxes, mandate subsidies or laws
208.727	and running Washington gridlock.
211.678	Let me say that again.
212.593	I'm going to tell you how to get the United States
215.362	completely off oil and coal, five trillion dollars cheaper
218.673	with no act of Congress
220.019	led by business for profit.
222.529	In other words, we're going to use our most effective institutions --
226.168	private enterprise co-evolving with civil society
229.981	and sped by military innovation
232.493	to go around our least effective institutions.
235.293	And whether you care most
237.627	about profits and jobs and competitive advantage
241.058	or national security, or environmental stewardship
243.468	and climate protection and public health,
245.629	reinventing fire makes sense and makes money.
249.912	General Eisenhower reputedly said
253.358	that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem
255.978	makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies.
260.547	So in reinventing fire,
262.216	we integrated all four sectors that use energy --
265.383	transportation, buildings, industry and electricity --
269.022	and we integrated four kinds of innovation,
271.645	not just technology and policy,
274.193	but also design and business strategy.
277.293	Those combinations yield
279.308	very much more than the sum of the parts,
281.414	especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities.
286.76	Oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day,
290.808	plus another four billion dollars a day
293.175	in hidden economic and military costs,
295.822	raising its total cost to over a sixth of GDP.
299.752	Our mobility fuel goes three-fifths to automobiles.
302.296	So let's start by making autos oil free.
304.942	Two-thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car
308.122	is caused by its weight.
310.324	And every unit of energy you save at the wheels,
313.831	by taking out weight or drag,
315.078	saves seven units in the tank,
317.108	because you don't have to waste six units
318.793	getting the energy to the wheels.
320.893	Unfortunately, over the past quarter century,
324.478	epidemic obesity has made our two-ton steel cars
327.193	gain weight twice as fast as we have.
331.016	But today, ultralight, ultrastrong materials,
334.67	like carbon fiber composites,
337.255	can make dramatic weight savings snowball
339.627	and can make cars simpler and cheaper to build.
343.542	Lighter and more slippery autos
345.908	need less force to move them,
348.155	so their engines get smaller.
350.429	Indeed, that sort of vehicle fitness
353.26	then makes electric propulsion affordable
356.427	because the batteries or fuel cells
359.56	also get smaller and lighter and cheaper.
363.16	So sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today,
367.06	while the driving cost, even from the start,
370.581	is very much lower.
372.329	So these innovations together can transform automakers
376.475	from wringing tiny savings
378.837	out of Victorian engine and seal-stamping technologies
382.168	to the steeply falling costs
384.906	of three linked innovations that strongly reenforce each other --
390.006	namely ultralight materials, making them into structures
393.929	and electric propulsion.
396.26	The sales can grow and the prices fall even faster
400.96	with temporary feebates,
402.668	that is rebates for efficient new autos
404.922	paid for by fees on inefficient ones.
408.022	And just in the first two years
410.868	the biggest of Europe's five feebate programs
414.316	has tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency.
418.362	The resulting shift to electric autos
421.791	is going to be as game-changing
423.262	as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers.
427.46	Of course, computers and electronics
429.56	are now America's biggest industry,
431.86	while typewriter makers have vanished.
434.014	So vehicle fitness
435.935	opens a new automotive competitive strategy
439.504	that can double the oil savings over the next 40 years,
442.758	but then also make electrification affordable,
445.635	and that displaces the rest of the oil.
449.619	America could lead this next automotive revolution.
453.175	Currently the leader is Germany.
455.66	Last year, Volkswagen announced
458.168	that by next year they'll be producing
460.391	this carbon fiber plugin hybrid
463.26	getting 230 miles a gallon.
465.668	Also last year, BMW announced
468.183	this carbon fiber electric car,
470.452	they said that its carbon fiber is paid for
472.427	by needing fewer batteries.
474.481	"And they said, ""We do not intend to be a typewriter maker."""
477.027	Audi claimed it's going to beat them both by a year.
480.535	Seven years ago, an even faster and cheaper
483.76	American manufacturing technology
486.352	was used to make this little carbon fiber test part,
493.796	which doubles as a carbon cap.
496.135	(Laughter)
497.698	In one minute -- and you can tell from the sound
500.76	how immensely stiff and strong it is.
503.593	Don't worry about dropping it, it's tougher than titanium.
507.085	Tom Friedman actually whacked it as hard as he could with a sledgehammer
509.308	without even scuffing it.
510.847	But such manufacturing techniques
512.962	can scale to automotive speed and cost
516.185	with aerospace performance.
517.639	They can save four-fifths of the capital needed to make autos.
521.16	They can save lives
522.322	because this stuff can absorb
523.614	up to 12 times as much crash energy per pound as steel.
526.878	If we made all of our autos this way,
528.627	it would save oil equivalent to finding
531.55	one and a half Saudi Arabias, or half an OPEC,
534.382	by drilling in the Detroit formation, a very prospective play.
538.814	And all those mega-barrels under Detroit
541.514	cost an average of 18 bucks a barrel.
544.027	They are all-American, carbon-free
545.873	and inexhaustible.
548.193	The same physics and the same business logic
550.947	also apply to big vehicles.
552.493	In the five years ending with 2010,
555.185	Walmart saved 60 percent of the fuel per ton-mile
559.76	in its giant fleet of heavy trucks
561.16	through better logistics and design.
562.56	But just the technological savings in heavy trucks
565.575	can get to two-thirds.
567.46	And combined with triple to quintuple efficiency airplanes,
570.747	now on the drawing board,
572.468	can save close to a trillion dollars.
574.714	Also today's military revolution in energy efficiency
579.083	is going to speed up all of these civilian advances
582.06	in much the same way that military R&amp;D
584.589	has given us the Internet, the Global Positioning System
587.783	and the jet engine and microchip industries.
590.852	As we design and build vehicles better,
594.375	we can also use them smarter
596.475	by harnessing four powerful techniques
598.722	for eliminating needless driving.
600.714	Instead of just seeing the travel grow,
603.506	we can use innovative pricing,
606.16	charging for road infrastructure by the mile, not by the gallon.
610.114	We can use some smart IT to enhance transit
613.36	and enable car sharing and ride sharing.
616.901	We can allow smart and lucrative growth models
621.16	that help people already be near where they want to be,
625.337	so they don't need to go somewhere else.
626.85	And we can use smart IT
628.96	to make traffic free-flowing.
631.512	Together, those things can give us the same or better access
634.327	with 46 to 84 percent less driving,
638.827	saving another 0.4 trillion dollars,
641.465	plus 0.3 trillion dollars from using trucks more productively.
646.46	So 40 years hence, when you add it all up,
649.165	a far more mobile U.S. economy
652.173	can use no oil.
654.252	Saving or displacing barrels for 25 bucks
657.76	rather than buying them for over a hundred,
659.16	adds up to a $4 trillion net saving
662.935	counting all the hidden costs at zero.
665.942	So to get mobility without oil,
668.86	to phase out the oil,
670.96	we can get efficient and then switch fuels.
674.391	Those 125 to 240 mile-per-gallon-equivalent autos
678.735	can use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells,
682.578	electricity and advanced biofuels.
685.689	The trucks and planes can realistically use
689.342	hydrogen or advanced biofuels.
692.162	The trucks could even use natural gas.
694.227	But no vehicles will need oil.
696.227	And the most biofuel we might need,
699.312	just three million barrels a day,
701.055	can be made two-thirds from waste
702.693	without displacing any cropland
704.527	and without harming soil or climate.
707.56	Our team speeds up these kinds of oil savings
709.575	"by what we call ""institutional acupuncture."""
712.527	We figure out where the business logic
713.927	is congested and not flowing properly,
716.396	we stick little needles in it to get it flowing,
718.208	working with partners like Ford and Walmart and the Pentagon.
720.701	And the long transition is already well under way.
724.162	In fact, three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil,
728.465	not in supply, but in demand.
731.412	And Deutsche Bank even said world oil use could peak around 2016.
736.524	In other words, oil is getting uncompetitive even at low prices
741.185	before it becomes unavailable even at high prices.
745.278	But the electrified vehicles
748.204	don't need to burden the electricity grid.
750.981	Rather, when smart autos exchange electricity and information
754.416	through smart buildings with smart grids,
756.842	they're adding to the grid valuable flexibility and storage
760.158	that help the grid integrate
762.008	varying solar and wind power.
764.855	So the electrified autos
766.531	make the auto and electricity problems
769.155	easier to solve together than separately.
771.393	And they also converge the oil story
773.224	with our second big story,
775.808	saving electricity and then making it differently.
779.568	And those twin revolutions in electricity
782.55	will bring to that sector
785.604	more numerous and profound and diverse disruptions
788.389	than any other sector,
789.75	because we've got 21st century technology and speed colliding head-on
793.965	with 20th and 19th century institutions, rules and cultures.
798.66	Changing how we make electricity gets easier
801.735	if we need less of it.
804.25	Most of it now is wasted
805.912	and the technologies for saving it
807.893	keep improving faster than we're installing them.
810.847	So the unbought efficiency resource
813.293	keeps getting ever bigger and cheaper.
816.193	But as efficiency in buildings and industry
819.255	starts to grow faster than the economy,
821.227	America's electricity use could actually shrink,
825.65	even with the little extra use required
829.247	for those efficient electrified autos.
831.227	And we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends.
836.055	Over the next 40 years, buildings,
838.393	which use three-quarters of the electricity,
840.601	can triple or quadruple their energy productivity,
844.435	saving 1.4 trillion dollars, net present value,
848.36	with a 33 percent internal rate of return
851.96	or in English,
853.631	the savings are worth four times what they cost.
856.827	And industry can accelerate too,
859.065	doubling its energy productivity
860.781	with a 21 percent internal rate of return.
863.729	The key is a disruptive innovation
865.768	that we call integrative design
868.591	that often makes very big energy savings
871.519	cost less than small or no savings.
873.996	That is, it can give you expanding returns,
876.624	not diminishing returns.
878.478	That is how our 2010 retrofit
882.224	is saving over two-fifths of the energy in the Empire State Building --
885.427	remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on site
889.581	into super windows that pass light, but reflect heat.
893.893	plus better lights and office equipment and such
897.078	cut the maximum cooling load by a third.
900.693	And then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones
905.76	saved 17 million dollars of
907.283	capital cost, which helped pay for the other improvements
910.66	and reduce the payback to just three years.
914.704	Integrative design can also increase
916.927	energy savings in industry.
919.135	Dow's billion-dollar efficiency investment
921.127	has already returned nine billion dollars.
924.427	But industry as a whole has another half-trillion dollars
927.373	of energy still to save.
929.568	For example, three-fifths of the world's electricity runs motors.
934.127	Half of that runs pumps and fans.
936.196	And those can all be made more efficient,
939.07	and the motors that turn them
940.785	can have their system efficiency roughly doubled
944.435	by integrating 35 improvements, paying back in about a year.
948.35	But first we ought to be capturing bigger, cheaper savings
951.578	that are normally ignored and are not in the textbooks.
954.227	For example, pumps, the biggest use of motors,
957.381	move liquid through pipes.
959.198	But a standard industrial pumping loop
960.998	was redesigned to use at least 86 percent less energy,
965.375	not by getting better pumps,
967.314	but just by replacing long, thin, crooked pipes
970.696	with fat, short, straight pipes.
973.312	This is not about new technology,
976.527	it's just rearranging our metal furniture.
978.504	Of course, it also shrinks the pumping equipment
980.858	and its capital costs.
982.573	So what do such savings mean
985.193	for the electricity that is three-fifths used in motors?
988.875	Well, from the coal burned at the power plant
991.975	through all these compounding losses,
995.096	only a tenth of the fuel energy
997.919	actually ends up coming out the pipe as flow.
1000.919	But now let's turn those compounding losses around backwards,
1004.593	and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe
1010.224	saves 10 units of fuel cost, pollution
1014.368	"and what Hunter Lovins calls ""global weirding"""
1016.991	back at the power plant.
1018.393	And of course, as you go back upstream,
1020.085	the components get smaller and therefore cheaper.
1023.385	Our team has lately found such snowballing energy savings
1027.965	in more than 30 billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns --
1031.198	everything from data centers and chip fabs
1033.927	to mines and refineries.
1036.119	Typically our retrofit designs
1037.56	save about 30 to 60 percent of the energy
1040.514	and pay back in a few years,
1042.46	while the new facility designs save 40 to 90-odd percent
1046.629	with generally lower capital cost.
1049.06	Now needing less electricity
1052.124	would ease and speed
1054.439	the shift to new sources of electricity, chiefly renewables.
1057.601	China leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost.
1062.085	In fact, these solar power module costs
1065.506	have just fallen off the bottom of the chart.
1067.885	And Germany now has more solar workers
1070.955	than America has steel workers.
1073.593	Already in about 20 states
1075.439	private installers will come
1077.793	put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down
1081.278	and beat your utility bill.
1083.147	Such unregulated products
1085.339	could ultimately add up to a virtual utility
1088.193	that bypasses your electric company
1091.147	just as your cellphone bypassed your wireline phone company.
1094.978	And this sort of thing gives utility executives the heebee-jeebees
1098.396	and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams.
1100.619	Renewables are no longer a fringe activity.
1103.712	For each of the past four years
1106.189	half of the world's new generating capacity
1109.027	has been renewable,
1110.624	mainly lately in developing countries.
1112.316	In 2010, renewables other than big hydro,
1116.608	particularly wind and solar cells,
1118.939	got 151 billion dollars of private investment,
1123.931	and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity
1126.516	of nuclear power in the world
1128.201	by adding 60 billion watts in that one year.
1131.66	That happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity
1135.36	that the world can now make every year --
1138.175	a number that goes up 60 or 70 percent a year.
1141.522	In contrast, the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity
1147.055	and the orders behind those keep fading
1150.624	because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk.
1153.16	In fact in this country,
1154.56	no new nuclear power plant
1156.675	has been able to raise any private construction capital,
1159.193	despite seven years of 100-plus percent subsidies.
1163.608	So how else could we replace the coal-fired power plants?
1167.612	Well efficiency and gas can displace them all
1171.381	at just below their operating cost
1174.065	and, combined with renewables, can displace them more than 23 times
1177.819	at less than their replacement cost.
1179.893	But we only need to replace them once.
1181.901	We're often told though
1184.589	that only coal and nuclear plants can keep the lights on,
1186.97	because they're 24/7,
1188.255	whereas wind and solar power are variable,
1191.078	and hence supposedly unreliable.
1194.093	Actually no generator is 24/7. They all break.
1197.478	And when a big plant goes down,
1199.593	you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds,
1202.385	often for weeks or months, often without warning.
1205.878	That is exactly why we've designed the grid
1207.875	to back up failed plants with working plants.
1212.145	And in exactly the same way,
1213.875	the grid can handle wind and solar power's
1218.906	forecastable variations.
1221.455	Hourly simulations
1224.762	show that largely or wholly renewable grids
1228.529	can deliver highly reliable power
1230.306	when they're forecasted,
1231.935	integrated and diversified
1233.989	by both type and location.
1236.042	And that's true both for continental areas like the U.S. or Europe
1240.265	and for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid.
1244.75	That is how, for example,
1246.389	four German states in 2010
1248.773	were 43 to 52 percent wind powered.
1251.385	Portugal was 45 percent renewable powered,
1255.027	Denmark 36.
1257.352	And it's how all of Europe can shift
1260.637	to renewable electricity.
1261.922	In America, our aging, dirty and insecure power system
1266.647	has to be replaced anyway by 2050.
1269.531	And whatever we replace it with
1271.158	is going to cost about the same,
1272.596	about six trillion dollars at present value --
1275.306	whether we buy more of what we've got
1277.514	or new nuclear and so-called clean coal,
1279.627	or renewables that are more or less centralized.
1283.258	But those four futures at the same cost
1286.527	differ profoundly in their risks,
1288.596	around national security,
1291.127	fuel, water, finance, technology,
1294.665	climate and health.
1296.196	For example, our over-centralized grid
1299.031	is very vulnerable to cascading
1302.962	and potentially economy-shattering blackouts
1305.689	caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters
1309.127	or a terrorist attack.
1311.073	But that blackout risk disappears,
1313.804	and all of the other risks are best managed,
1315.796	with distributed renewables
1318.05	organized into local micro-grids that normally interconnect,
1322.327	but can stand alone at need.
1324.135	That is, they can disconnect fractally
1326.173	and then reconnect seamlessly.
1329.027	That approach is exactly what the Pentagon is adopting
1332.304	for its own power supply.
1333.619	They think they need that; how about the rest of us that they're defending?
1336.885	We want our stuff to work too.
1338.585	At about the same cost as business as usual,
1342.155	this would maximize national security,
1344.16	customer choice, entrepreneurial opportunity
1348.162	and innovation.
1349.785	Together, efficient use and diverse dispersed renewable supply
1355.46	are starting to transform the whole electricity sector.
1358.383	Traditionally utilities build
1360.014	a lot of giant coal and nuclear plants
1362.183	and a bunch of big gas plants
1364.129	and maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables.
1365.198	And those utilities were rewarded,
1367.727	as they still are in 34 states,
1370.181	for selling you more electricity.
1373.647	However, especially where regulators
1376.445	are now instead rewarding cutting your bills,
1379.998	the investments are shifting radically
1383.781	toward efficiency, demand response, cogeneration,
1386.312	renewables and ways to knit them all together reliably
1389.681	with less transmission
1391.104	and little or no bulk electricity storage.
1393.958	So our energy future is not fate, but choice,
1396.785	and that choice is very flexible.
1399.531	In 1976, for example,
1401.131	government and industry insisted
1402.955	that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of GDP
1405.539	could never go down.
1407.322	And I heretically suggested it could go down several-fold.
1410.952	Well that's what's actually happened so far.
1413.216	It's fallen by half.
1414.531	But with today's much better technologies,
1417.022	more mature delivery channels and integrative design,
1419.931	we can do far more and even cheaper.
1423.831	So to solve the energy problem,
1426.339	we just needed to enlarge it.
1428.26	And the results may at first seem incredible,
1431.46	but as Marshall McLuhan said,
1433.237	"""Only puny secrets need protection."
1435.989	"Big discoveries are protected by public incredulity."""
1442.073	Now combine the electricity and oil revolutions,
1445.555	both driven by modern efficiency,
1447.239	and you get the really big story: reinventing fire,
1450.781	where business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets
1455.912	can lead the United States completely off oil and coal by 2050,
1460.442	saving 5 trillion dollars,
1462.762	growing the economy 2.6-fold,
1465.355	strengthening out national security,
1466.998	oh, and by the way, by getting rid of the oil and coal,
1469.983	reducing the fossil carbon emissions by 82 to 86 percent.
1474.493	Now if you like any of those outcomes,
1477.827	you can support reinventing fire
1480.019	without needing to like all of them
1481.881	and without needing to agree about which of them is most important.
1485.304	So focusing on outcomes, not motives,
1488.381	can turn gridlock and conflict
1490.937	into a unifying solution to America's energy challenge.
1495.239	This also turns out to be the best way
1498.296	to cope with global challenges --
1500.796	climate change, nuclear proliferation,
1503.375	energy insecurity, energy poverty --
1505.806	all of which make us less safe.
1509.452	Now our team at RMI helps smart companies
1513.139	to get unstuck and speed this journey
1516.208	via six sectoral initiatives, with some more hatching.
1519.27	Of course there's still a lot of old thinking out there too.
1522.227	Former oil man Maurice Strong said,
1525.404	"""Not all the fossils are in the fuel."""
1527.35	But as Edgar Woolard, who used to chair Dupont, reminds us,
1531.655	"""Companies hampered by old thinking won't be a problem"
1535.801	"because,"" he said,"" they simply won't be around long-term."""
1541.381	I've described not just a once-in-a-civilization
1544.245	business opportunity,
1545.852	but one of the most profound transitions
1548.275	in the history of our species.
1550.791	We humans are inventing a new fire,
1554.214	not dug from below,
1555.958	but flowing from above;
1558.865	not scarce, but bountiful;
1561.796	not local, but everywhere;
1563.496	not transient, but permanent;
1566.127	not costly, but free.
1569.027	And but for a little transitional tail of natural gas
1572.427	and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure,
1575.989	this new fire is flameless.
1579.698	Efficiently used, it really can do our work
1583.762	without working our undoing.
1586.616	Each of you owns a piece of that $5 trillion prize.
1591.498	"And our new book ""Reinventing Fire"""
1593.752	describes how you can capture it.
1596.137	So with the conversation just begun
1598.406	at ReinventingFire.com,
1600.291	let me invite you each
1602.422	to engage with us and with each other, with everyone around you,
1606.26	to help make the world richer, fairer,
1609.052	cooler and safer
1611.66	by together reinventing fire.
1614.468	Thank you.
1616.327	(Applause)
