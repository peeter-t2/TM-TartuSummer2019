16.01	I'm a very lucky person.
19.319	I've been privileged to see so much of our beautiful Earth
23.797	and the people and creatures that live on it.
26.125	And my passion was inspired at the age of seven,
29.745	when my parents first took me to Morocco,
32.08	at the edge of the Sahara Desert.
34.206	Now imagine a little Brit
36.581	somewhere that wasn't cold and damp like home.
39.702	What an amazing experience.
41.978	And it made me want to explore more.
44.471	So as a filmmaker,
47.074	I've been from one end of the Earth to the other
49.885	trying to get the perfect shot
52.593	and to capture animal behavior never seen before.
56.385	And what's more, I'm really lucky,
59.017	because I get to share that with millions of people worldwide.
62.135	Now the idea of having new perspectives of our planet
67.385	and actually being able to get that message out
71.218	gets me out of bed every day with a spring in my step.
74.076	You might think that it's quite hard
77.218	to find new stories and new subjects,
79.468	but new technology is changing the way we can film.
83.799	It's enabling us to get fresh, new images
87.635	and tell brand new stories.
89.752	In Nature's Great Events,
92.635	a series for the BBC that I did with David Attenborough,
96.177	we wanted to do just that.
98.427	Images of grizzly bears are pretty familiar.
101.468	You see them all the time, you think.
104.718	But there's a whole side to their lives that we hardly ever see
108.802	and had never been filmed.
110.51	So what we did, we went to Alaska,
114.76	which is where the grizzlies rely
117.128	on really high, almost inaccessible, mountain slopes
120.114	for their denning.
122.049	And the only way to film that is a shoot from the air.
129.564	(Video) David Attenborough: Throughout Alaska and British Columbia,
134.177	thousands of bear families are emerging from their winter sleep.
139.389	There is nothing to eat up here,
143.343	but the conditions were ideal for hibernation.
146.843	Lots of snow in which to dig a den.
154.71	To find food, mothers must lead their cubs down to the coast,
160.7	where the snow will already be melting.
167.762	But getting down can be a challenge for small cubs.
200.983	These mountains are dangerous places,
204.718	but ultimately the fate of these bear families,
208.177	and indeed that of all bears around the North Pacific,
211.691	depends on the salmon.
216.324	KB: I love that shot.
218.885	I always get goosebumps every time I see it.
221.177	That was filmed from a helicopter
223.218	using a gyro-stabilized camera.
226.01	And it's a wonderful bit of gear,
228.468	because it's like having a flying tripod, crane and dolly all rolled into one.
232.427	But technology alone isn't enough.
235.635	To really get the money shots,
238.135	it's down to being in the right place at the right time.
241.177	And that sequence was especially difficult.
244.135	The first year we got nothing.
247.635	We had to go back the following year,
251.218	all the way back to the remote parts of Alaska.
254.218	And we hung around with a helicopter for two whole weeks.
256.843	And eventually we got lucky.
259.885	The cloud lifted, the wind was still,
264.218	and even the bear showed up.
265.968	And we managed to get that magic moment.
268.552	For a filmmaker,
270.427	new technology is an amazing tool,
274.6	but the other thing that really, really excites me
277.806	is when new species are discovered.
280.76	Now, when I heard about one animal,
283.047	I knew we had to get it for my next series,
286.01	Untamed Americas, for National Geographic.
288.76	In 2005, a new species of bat was discovered
295.071	in the cloud forests of Ecuador.
297.343	And what was amazing about that discovery
299.427	is that it also solved the mystery
301.843	of what pollinated a unique flower.
304.88	It depends solely on the bat.
306.843	Now, the series hasn't even aired yet,
309.577	so you're the very first to see this.
312.004	See what you think.
316.85	(Video) Narrator: The tube-lipped nectar bat.
325.796	A pool of delicious nectar
328.137	lies at the bottom of each flower's long flute.
330.302	But how to reach it?
335.147	Necessity is the mother of evolution.
340.343	(Music)
363.749	This two-and-a-half-inch bat
366.756	has a three-and-a-half-inch tongue,
373.481	the longest relative to body length
377.379	of any mammal in the world.
379.698	If human, he'd have a nine-foot tongue.
391.382	(Applause)
393.872	KB: What a tongue.
395.937	We filmed it by cutting a tiny little hole in the base of the flower
400.802	and using a camera that could slow the action by 40 times.
405.427	So imagine how quick that thing is in real life.
408.51	"Now people often ask me, ""Where's your favorite place on the planet?"""
413.722	And the truth is I just don't have one.
416.255	There are so many wonderful places.
418.802	But some locations draw you back time and time again.
422.302	And one remote location --
425.05	I first went there as a backpacker;
427.07	I've been back several times for filming,
429.385	most recently for Untamed Americas --
431.135	it's the Altiplano in the high Andes of South America,
435.885	and it's the most otherworldly place I know.
441.052	But at 15,000 feet, it's tough.
444.154	It's freezing cold,
445.677	and that thin air really gets you.
450.343	Sometimes it's hard to breathe,
452.654	especially carrying all the heavy filming equipment.
455.697	And that pounding head just feels like a constant hangover.
460.302	But the advantage of that wonderful thin atmosphere
464.593	is that it enables you to see the stars in the heavens
468.531	with amazing clarity.
470.97	Have a look.
475.156	(Video) Narrator: Some 1,500 miles south of the tropics,
478.812	between Chile and Bolivia,
480.497	the Andes completely change.
485.673	"It's called the Altiplano, or ""high plains"" --"
490.302	a place of extremes
494.185	and extreme contrasts.
497.874	Where deserts freeze
502.385	and waters boil.
506.218	More like Mars than Earth,
509.718	it seems just as hostile to life.
520.456	The stars themselves --
530.325	at 12,000 feet, the dry, thin air
534.046	makes for perfect stargazing.
542.189	Some of the world's astronomers have telescopes nearby.
548.073	But just looking up with the naked eye,
552.145	you really don't need one.
555.39	(Music)
602.4	(Applause)
608.427	KB: Thank you so much
611.744	for letting me share some images
614.218	of our magnificent, wonderful Earth.
617.127	Thank you for letting me share that with you.
619.024	(Applause)
