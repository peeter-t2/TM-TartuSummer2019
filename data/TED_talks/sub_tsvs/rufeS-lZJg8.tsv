13.341	Like most journalists, I'm an idealist.
15.857	I love unearthing good stories,
15.857	especially untold stories.
21.126	I just didn't think that in 2011,
23.583	women would still be in that category.
26.538	I'm the President of the Journalism
26.538	and Women Symposium -- JAWS.
30.539	That's Sharky.
31.715	(Laughter)
33.23	I joined 10 years ago
33.23	because I wanted female role models,
36.058	and I was frustrated by the lagging status
36.058	of women in our profession
40.281	and what that meant
40.281	for our image in the media.
44.086	We make up half
44.086	the population of the world,
46.213	but we're just 24 percent
46.213	of the news subjects
48.824	quoted in news stories.
50.752	And we're just 20 percent
50.752	of the experts quoted in stories.
54.461	And now, with today's technology,
56.557	it's possible to remove women
56.557	from the picture completely.
60.588	This is a picture of President
60.588	Barack Obama and his advisors,
64.484	tracking the killing of Osama bin Laden.
66.596	You can see Hillary Clinton on the right.
69.261	Let's see how the photo ran
70.605	in an Orthodox Jewish
70.605	newspaper based in Brooklyn.
74.327	Hillary's completely gone.
76.064	(Laughter)
78.936	The paper apologized,
78.936	but said it never runs photos of women;
82.009	they might be sexually provocative.
83.965	(Laughter)
86.099	This is an extreme case, yes.
88.171	But the fact is,
89.362	women are only 19 percent
89.362	of the sources in stories on politics,
93.505	and only 20 percent
93.505	in stories on the economy.
98.21	The news continues to give us a picture
100.115	where men outnumber women
101.751	in nearly all occupational
101.751	categories, except two:
104.489	students and homemakers.
107.001	(Laughter)
108.282	So we all get a very
108.282	distorted picture of reality.
112.414	The problem is, of course,
112.414	there aren't enough women in newsrooms.
115.544	They report at just 37 percent of stories
115.544	in print, TV and radio.
120.006	Even in stories on gender-based violence,
123.11	men get an overwhelming majority
123.11	of print space and airtime.
126.737	Case in point:
128.999	This March, the New York Times
128.999	ran a story by James McKinley
131.927	about a gang rape of a young girl,
136.515	McKinley writes that
136.515	the community is wondering,
139.594	"""How could their boys"
139.594	"have been drawn into this?"""
143.136	"""Drawn into this"" --"
144.564	like they were seduced
144.564	into committing an act of violence.
147.668	And the first person he quotes says,
149.677	"""These boys will have to live"
149.677	"with this the rest of their lives."""
152.774	(Groans, laughter)
155.636	You don't hear much
155.636	about the 11-year-old victim,
158.644	except that she wore clothes
158.644	that were a little old for her
162.085	and she wore makeup.
164.223	The Times was deluged with criticism.
167.37	Initially, it defended itself,
168.973	"and said, ""These aren't our views."
170.718	"This is what we found in our reporting."""
172.67	Now, here's a secret
172.67	you probably know already:
175.492	Your stories are constructed.
177.114	As reporters, we research, we interview.
180.159	We try to give a good picture of reality.
183.091	We also have our own unconscious biases.
185.86	But The Times makes it sound like anyone
185.86	would have reported this story
189.407	the same way.
191.175	I disagree with that.
193.083	So three weeks later,
194.859	The Times revisits the story.
196.41	This time, it adds another byline
196.41	to it with McKinley's:
200.183	Erica Goode.
201.683	What emerges is a truly sad, horrific tale
204.609	of a young girl and her family
204.609	trapped in poverty.
207.592	She was raped numerous times by many men.
210.703	She had been a bright, easygoing girl.
213.117	She was maturing quickly, physically,
215.703	but her bed was still covered
215.703	with stuffed animals.
218.719	It's a very different picture.
220.64	Perhaps the addition of Ms. Goode
220.64	is what made this story more complete.
224.96	The Global Media Monitoring Project
224.96	has found that stories by female reporters
229.094	are more likely to challenge stereotypes
229.094	than those by male reporters.
232.887	At KUNM here in Albuquerque,
234.284	Elaine Baumgartel
234.284	did some graduate research
236.443	on the coverage of violence against women.
238.736	What she found was many of these
238.736	stories tend to blame victims
242.133	and devalue their lives.
243.676	They tend to sensationalize,
243.676	and they lack context.
247.423	So for her graduate work,
248.662	she did a three-part series
248.662	on the murder of 11 women,
251.583	found buried on Albuquerque's West Mesa.
254.183	She tried to challenge those patterns
254.183	and stereotypes in her work
257.571	and she tried to show
257.571	the challenges that journalists face
260.436	from external sources,
260.436	their own internal biases
263.98	and cultural norms.
265.652	And she worked with an editor
265.652	at National Public Radio
268.399	to try to get a story aired nationally.
270.956	She's not sure that would have happened
270.956	if the editor had not been a female.
275.472	Stories in the news
276.695	are more than twice as likely
276.695	to present women as victims than men,
280.956	and women are more likely to be defined
280.956	by their body parts.
285.562	Wired magazine, November 2010.
288.44	Yes, the issue was about
288.44	breast-tissue engineering.
292.769	Now I know you're all distracted,
292.769	so I'll take that off.
295.467	(Laughter)
296.492	Eyes up here.
297.67	(Laughter)
300.946	So --
302.121	(Applause)
306.323	Here's the thing:
307.507	Wired almost never puts
307.507	women on its cover.
310.414	Oh, there have been some gimmicky ones --
312.415	"Pam from ""The Office,"""
314.041	manga girls,
315.974	a voluptuous model
315.974	covered in synthetic diamonds.
319.863	Texas State University professor
319.863	Cindy Royal wondered in her blog
323.455	how are young women like her students
323.455	supposed to feel about their roles
327.47	in technology, reading Wired.
328.962	Chris Anderson, the editor of Wired,
328.962	defended his choice
332.239	and said there aren't enough women,
332.239	prominent women
334.652	in technology to sell a cover,
334.652	to sell an issue.
338.581	Part of that is true,
339.764	there aren't as many
339.764	prominent women in technology.
342.336	Here's my problem with that argument:
344.85	Media tells us every day what's important,
347.453	by the stories they choose
347.453	and where they place them;
349.98	it's called agenda setting.
352.433	How many people knew
352.433	the founders of Facebook and Google
355.192	before their faces
355.192	were on a magazine cover?
357.384	Putting them there
357.384	made them more recognizable.
360.265	Now, Fast Company Magazine
360.265	embraces that idea.
363.085	This is its cover from November 15, 2010.
366.371	The issue is about the most prominent
366.371	and influential women in technology.
370.827	Editor Robert Safian
370.827	told the Poynter Institute,
373.39	"""Silicon Valley is very white"
373.39	and very male.
376.261	But that's not what Fast Company thinks
378.579	the business world
378.579	will look like in the future,
380.967	so it tries to give a picture
380.967	"of where the globalized world is moving."""
385.354	By the way, apparently,
385.354	Wired took all this to heart.
388.459	This was its issue in April.
390.032	(Laughter)
391.934	That's Limor Fried, the founder
391.934	of Adafruit Industries,
394.775	in the Rosie the Riveter pose.
397.704	It would help to have more women
397.704	in positions of leadership in media.
401.198	A recent global survey
402.459	found that 73 percent
402.459	of the top media-management jobs
405.349	are still held by men.
407.335	But this is also about something
407.335	far more complex:
409.992	our own unconscious
409.992	biases and blind spots.
413.817	Shankar Vedantam is the author
415.465	"of ""The Hidden Brain: How Our Unconscious"
415.465	Minds Elect Presidents,
418.537	Control Markets, Wage Wars,
418.537	"and Save Our Lives."""
421.718	He told the former ombudsman
421.718	at National Public Radio,
424.869	who was doing a report
424.869	on how women fare in NPR coverage,
428.63	unconscious bias flows
428.63	throughout most of our lives.
431.744	It's really difficult
431.744	to disentangle those strands.
435.311	But he did have one suggestion.
437.301	He used to work for two editors
440.116	who said every story had to have
440.116	at least one female source.
444.099	He balked at first,
445.616	but said he eventually followed
445.616	the directive happily,
448.592	because his stories got better
450.057	and his job got easier.
452.014	Now, I don't know if one
452.014	of the editors was a woman,
454.636	but that can make the biggest difference.
457.037	The Dallas Morning News
457.037	won a Pulitzer Prize in 1994
461.027	for a series it did on women
461.027	around the world,
463.654	but one of the reporters told me
465.385	she's convinced
465.385	it never would have happened
467.758	if they had not had
467.758	a female assistant foreign editor,
471.193	and they would not have gotten
471.193	some of those stories
473.701	without female reporters
473.701	and editors on the ground,
476.216	particularly one
476.216	on female genital mutilation --
479.142	men would just not be allowed
479.142	into those situations.
482.22	This is an important point to consider,
484.478	because much of our foreign policy
484.478	now revolves around countries
487.758	where the treatment of women is an issue,
490.203	such as Afghanistan.
493.578	What we're told in terms of arguments
493.578	against leaving this country
497.726	is that the fate of the women is primary.
501.701	Now, I'm sure a male reporter in Kabul
501.701	can find women to interview.
505.835	Not so sure about rural,
505.835	traditional areas,
509.631	where I'm guessing
509.631	women can't talk to strange men.
512.858	It's important to keep talking about this,
512.858	in light of Lara Logan.
516.881	She was the CBS News correspondent
519.057	who was brutally sexually assaulted
519.057	in Egypt's Tahrir Square,
521.994	right after this photo was taken.
524.133	Almost immediately, pundits weighed in,
526.926	blaming her and saying things like,
530.189	"""You know, maybe women shouldn't"
530.189	"be sent to cover those stories."""
533.613	I never heard anyone say this
533.613	about Anderson Cooper and his crew,
536.874	who were attacked covering the same story.
540.387	One way to get more women into leadership
542.462	is to have other women mentor them.
544.64	One of my board members is an editor
544.64	at a major global media company,
548.257	but she never thought
548.257	about this as a career path,
550.917	until she met female role models at JAWS.
554.425	But this is not just a job
554.425	for super-journalists
556.949	or my organization.
558.152	You all have a stake
558.152	in a strong, vibrant media.
561.743	Analyze your news.
563.474	And speak up when there are gaps
563.474	missing in coverage,
566.055	like people at The New York Times did.
568.03	Suggest female sources
568.03	to reporters and editors.
571.41	Remember -- a complete picture of reality
571.41	may depend upon it.
575.48	And I'll leave you with a video clip
577.219	that I first saw in [1987]
577.219	when I was a student in London.
581.137	It's for The Guardian newspaper.
582.733	It's actually long before I ever thought
582.733	about becoming a journalist,
586.106	but I was very interested
586.106	in how we learn to perceive our world.
590.823	Narrator: An event seen from one
590.823	point of view gives one impression.
600.579	Seen from another point of view,
602.355	it gives quite a different impression.
606.982	But it's only when you get
606.982	the whole picture,
609.384	you can fully understand what's going on.
615.809	[The Guardian]
617.825	Megan Kamerick: I think you'll all agree
619.771	that we'd be better off
619.771	if we all had the whole picture.
