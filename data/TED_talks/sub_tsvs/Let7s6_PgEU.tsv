13.723	Please meet Jane.
15.644	She has a high-risk pregnancy.
17.663	Within 24 weeks,
19.444	she's on bed rest at the hospital,
21.629	being monitored
21.629	for her preterm contractions.
25.024	She doesn't look the happiest.
26.942	That's in part because it requires
26.942	technicians and experts
30.187	to apply these clunky belts on her
30.187	to monitor her uterine contractions.
35.55	Another reason Jane is not so happy
35.55	is because she's worried.
40.768	In particular, she's worried
40.768	about what happens
43.418	after her 10-day stay
43.418	on bed rest at the hospital.
47.438	What happens when she's home?
49.532	If she were to give birth this early
49.532	it would be devastating.
53.874	As an African-American woman,
55.652	she's twice as likely
55.652	to have a premature birth
59.376	or to have a stillbirth.
61.551	So Jane basically has one of two options:
64.553	stay at the hospital on bed rest,
67.237	a prisoner to the technology
67.237	until she gives birth,
71.469	and then spend the rest
71.469	of her life paying for the bill;
74.946	or head home after her 10-day stay
74.946	and hope for the best.
80.198	Neither of these two options
80.198	seems appealing.
84.132	As I began to think
84.132	about stories like this
86.267	and hear about stories like this,
88.077	I began to ask myself and imagine:
90.194	Is there an alternative?
91.76	Is there a way we could have
91.76	the benefits of high-fidelity monitoring
96.52	that we get with our trusted
96.52	partners in the hospital
99.343	while someone is at home
99.343	living their daily life?
102.832	With that in mind,
104.351	I encouraged people in my research group
106.322	to partner with some
106.322	clever material scientists,
109.854	and all of us came together
109.854	and brainstormed.
112.904	And after a long process,
114.369	we came up with a vision, an idea,
116.787	of a wearable system that perhaps
116.787	you could wear like a piece of jewelry
120.589	or you could apply
120.589	to yourself like a Band-Aid.
123.463	And after many trials and tribulations
123.463	and years of endeavors,
127.67	we were able to come up
127.67	with this flexible electronic patch
131.421	that was manufactured
131.421	using the same processes
133.84	that they use to build computer chips,
136.545	except the electronics are transferred
136.545	from a semiconductor wafer
141.001	onto a flexible material
141.001	that can interface with the human body.
145.775	These systems are about
145.775	the thickness of a human hair.
150.006	They can measure the types
150.006	of information that we want,
153.948	things such as:
155.151	bodily movement,
156.67	bodily temperature,
158.098	electrical rhythms of the body
159.927	and so forth.
161.403	We can also engineer these systems,
163.883	so they can integrate energy sources,
166.877	and can have wireless
166.877	transmission capabilities.
170.624	So as we began to build
170.624	these types of systems,
174.553	we began to test them on ourselves
174.553	in our research group.
178.915	But in addition, we began to reach out
178.915	to some of our clinical partners
182.303	in San Diego,
183.482	and test these on different patients
183.482	in different clinical conditions,
187.206	including moms-to-be like Jane.
190.531	Here is a picture of a pregnant woman
190.531	in labor at our university hospital
195.535	being monitored for her uterine
195.535	contractions with the conventional belt.
200.939	In addition,
202.114	our flexible electronic patches are there.
205.268	This picture demonstrates waveforms
205.268	pertaining to the fetal heart rate,
209.568	where the red corresponds
209.568	to what was acquired
212.509	with the conventional belts,
214.112	and the blue corresponds to our estimates
216.794	using our flexible electronic systems
216.794	and our algorithms.
220.932	At this moment,
222.404	we gave ourselves a big mental high five.
225.508	Some of the things we had imagined
225.508	were beginning to come to fruition,
228.939	and we were actually seeing this
228.939	in a clinical context.
232.083	But there was still a problem.
233.974	The problem was, the way
233.974	we manufactured these systems
237.359	was very inefficient,
238.84	had low yield
240.021	and was very error-prone.
242.105	In addition,
243.28	as we talked to some
243.28	of the nurses in the hospital,
245.776	they encouraged us to make sure
247.99	that our electronics worked
247.99	with typical medical adhesives
252.027	that are used in a hospital.
254.217	We had an epiphany and said,
254.217	"""Wait a minute."
256.998	Rather than just making
256.998	them work with adhesives,
259.693	let's integrate them into adhesives,
263.194	and that could solve
263.194	"our manufacturing problem."""
266.269	This picture that you see here
268.284	is our ability to embed these censors
268.284	inside of a piece of Scotch tape
272.803	by simply peeling it off of a wafer.
276.255	Ongoing work in our research group
276.255	allows us to, in addition,
279.648	embed integrated circuits
279.648	into the flexible adhesives
283.381	to do things like amplifying signals
283.381	and digitizing them,
287.095	processing them
288.297	and encoding for wireless transmission.
291.113	All of this integrated
291.113	into the same medical adhesives
295.039	that are used in the hospital.
297.81	So when we reached this point,
299.326	we had some other challenges,
301.774	from both an engineering
301.774	as well as a usability perspective,
305.113	to make sure that we could
305.113	make it used practically.
309.207	In many digital health discussions,
311.718	people believe in and embrace the idea
311.718	that we can simply digitize the data,
316.689	wirelessly transmit it,
318.293	send it to the cloud,
319.791	and in the cloud,
321.012	we can extract meaningful
321.012	information for interpretation.
324.147	And indeed, you can do all of that,
326.648	if you're not worried
326.648	about some of the energy challenges.
329.661	Think about Jane for a moment.
331.348	She doesn't live in Palo Alto,
333.176	nor does she live in Beverly Hills.
335.359	What that means is,
336.541	we have to be mindful about her data plan
336.541	and how much it would cost
339.895	for her to be sending out
339.895	a continuous stream of data.
344.383	There's another challenge
345.686	that not everyone in the medical
345.686	profession is comfortable talking about.
349.408	And that is, that Jane
349.408	does not have the most trust
352.26	in the medical establishment.
354.46	She, people like her, her ancestors,
354.46	have not had the best experiences
359.623	at the hands of doctors and the hospital
363.163	or insurance companies.
365.466	That means that we have to be mindful
365.466	of questions of privacy.
368.831	Jane might not feel that happy
370.476	about all that data
370.476	being processed into the cloud.
374.712	And Jane cannot be fooled;
377.346	she reads the news.
378.854	She knows that if the federal
378.854	government can be hacked,
381.848	if the Fortune 500 can be hacked,
384.409	so can her doctor.
387.014	And so with that in mind,
388.773	we had an epiphany.
390.858	We cannot outsmart
390.858	all the hackers in the world,
393.612	but perhaps we can present
393.612	them a smaller target.
396.986	What if we could actually,
399.191	rather than have those algorithms
399.191	that do data interpretation
403.147	run in the cloud,
404.904	what if we have those algorithms run
404.904	on those small integrated circuits
408.339	embedded into those adhesives?
410.995	And so when we integrate
410.995	these things together,
414.113	what this means is that now
414.113	we can think about the future
417.641	where someone like Jane can still
417.641	go about living her normal daily life,
421.73	she can be monitored,
423.226	it can be done in a way where
423.226	she doesn't have to get another job
426.75	to pay her data plan,
428.239	and we can also address
428.239	some of her concerns about privacy.
432.907	So at this point,
434.081	we're feeling very good about ourselves.
436.109	We've accomplished this,
437.296	we've begun to address some
437.296	of these questions about privacy
440.49	and we feel like, pretty much
440.49	the chapter is closed now.
444.405	Everyone lived happily ever after, right?
448.751	Well, not so fast.
450.338	(Laughter)
451.567	One of the things we have to remember,
451.567	as I mentioned earlier,
454.631	is that Jane does not have the most trust
454.631	in the medical establishment.
458.036	We have to remember
459.223	that there are increasing
459.223	and widening health disparities,
462.761	and there's inequity in terms
462.761	of proper care management.
466.616	And so what that means
466.616	is that this simple picture
469.134	of Jane and her data --
470.803	even with her being comfortable
470.803	being wirelessly transmitted to the cloud,
474.754	letting a doctor intervene if necessary --
477.093	is not the whole story.
479.091	So what we're beginning to do
480.509	is to think about ways to have
480.509	trusted parties serve as intermediaries
485.36	between people like Jane
485.36	and her health care providers.
488.802	For example, we've begun
488.802	to partner with churches
491.837	and to think about nurses
491.837	that are church members,
494.718	that come from that trusted community,
496.764	as patient advocates and health coaches
496.764	to people like Jane.
501.462	Another thing we have going for us
503.493	is that insurance companies, increasingly,
505.553	are attracted to some of these ideas.
507.906	They're increasingly realizing
509.637	that perhaps it's better
509.637	to pay one dollar now
512.601	for a wearable device and a health coach,
515.608	rather than paying 10 dollars later,
518.253	when that baby is born prematurely
520.831	and ends up in the neonatal
520.831	intensive care unit --
523.796	one of the most expensive
523.796	parts of a hospital.
527.697	This has been a long
527.697	learning process for us.
530.593	This iterative process of breaking
530.593	through and attacking one problem
534.452	and not feeling totally comfortable,
536.247	and identifying the next problem,
538.09	has helped us go along this path
540.171	of actually trying to not only
540.171	innovate with this technology
543.271	but make sure it can be used for people
543.271	who perhaps need it the most.
547.709	Another learning lesson
547.709	we've taken from this process
550.517	that is very humbling,
551.92	is that as technology progresses
551.92	and advances at an accelerating rate,
556.271	we have to remember that human beings
556.271	are using this technology,
560.237	and we have to be mindful
561.863	that these human beings --
561.863	they have a face,
565.327	they have a name
566.613	and a life.
567.798	And in the case of Jane,
569.433	hopefully, two.
572.041	Thank you.
573.259	(Applause)
