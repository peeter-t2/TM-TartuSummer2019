12.963	"This is a play called ""Sell/Buy/Date."""
14.892	"It's my first since ""Bridge and Tunnel,"""
14.892	which I did on Broadway,
17.963	and this one, I -- thank you --
21.333	I've excerpted it just for you,
21.333	so here we go.
29.763	Right. Class, let's be absolutely certain
32.901	all electronic devices are switched off
32.901	before we begin.
38.268	So class, hopefully you'll recognize
38.268	what you just heard me say as the -- ?
43.985	Very good, the cellular
43.985	phone announcement.
47.199	Right? This was also known
47.199	as a mobile phone.
51.378	So you'll remember, people of that era
53.607	would have had an external
53.607	electronic device, right,
58.483	something like this,
60.434	and they all would have carried
60.434	one of these around with them,
63.37	and amongst their biggest fears
63.37	was the sheer mortification
66.749	that one of these might ring
66.749	at some inopportune moment.
70.139	Right? So a bit of trivia
70.139	about that era for you.
72.54	(Laughter)
75.1	So the format of today's class is
77.851	I will be presenting multiple
77.851	BERT modules today
81.793	from that period in history, right,
84.163	so starting circa 2016.
86.973	And remember, this was
86.973	the very first year of the BERT program.
91.32	So we've got quite a few
91.32	of these to get through.
93.69	Bear in mind, I will be living
93.69	into various different bodies,
97.697	different ages,
99.815	also what were then called races,
99.815	or ethnic groups,
103.403	as you'll remember from Unit 1.
105.493	And -- (Laughter) -- and along
105.493	the gender continuum,
108.813	I will be living into males as well.
111.321	It was quite binary at that time.
112.991	(Laughter)
114.55	Also, don't forget, we are reading
114.55	the book module
117.867	for next week's focus on gender.
119.842	Now, I know some of you
119.842	have requested the book in pill form.
123.885	I know people still believe
123.885	ingesting it is better for retention,
128.201	but since we are trying to experience
128.201	what our forebears did, right,
133.7	let's please just consider doing
133.7	the actual ocular reading, okay?
139.207	And also, how many people
139.207	have your emotional shunts engaged?
144.222	Right. Please toggle them off. Okay?
146.916	I know it's challenging, but I want you
146.916	to be able to feel the entire
151.861	natural emo range, all right?
153.719	It is essential to this
153.719	part of the syllabus.
157.888	Yes, Macy?
159.756	All right. I understand.
159.756	If you're unwilling to --
163.627	All right, well, we can discuss
163.627	that after class.
165.996	All right, we will discuss your concerns.
168.429	Just relax. Nobody's died
168.429	and gone to composting.
172.549	Okay. After class. Okay? After class.
177.133	Let's just get started, okay.
179.144	This first subject identified
179.144	as a middle-class homemaker.
185.552	Remember, these early modules
187.851	in these people's full identities
187.851	were protected,
191.984	and this allowed them to speak
191.984	more freely on our topic,
195.2	which for many of them was taboo.
200.11	Okay honey, now,
200.11	I'm ready when you are.
203.732	No, sweetheart, I said,
203.732	I'm ready when you are.
208.06	I'm freezing.
210.061	It's like a meat locker in here
210.061	in this recording studio.
213.206	I should have brought a shmata.
215.806	All this fancy technology
215.806	but they can't afford heat.
220.375	What is he saying? I can't hear you!
223.678	I can't hear you
223.678	through the glass, honey!
226.557	There you are in my ear.
229.32	Oh, you can hear me?
231.92	The whole time.
233.778	Oh, yes, I am a little chilly.
237.98	Yes, oh the cold is for the machines,
237.98	the new technology. Okay.
243.553	Yes, now remind me again, you're recording
243.553	not only my voice but my feelings
249.304	and my memories? Right.
252.414	Yes, BERT, yes, I read about it.
254.433	Bio-Empathetic Resonant Technology.
257.484	Right, right, so people will be able
257.484	to feel my experience
262.641	and my memory? Okay.
264.543	No, right, I'm ready.
265.958	I just thought you were going to give me
265.958	a test to see how my memory's doing.
270.055	I was going to tell you you're too late,
270.055	it's already bad news.
274.847	No, no, go ahead, honey.
277.648	Oh, that's the first question?
279.984	What do I think of prostitution?
283.258	Are you soliciting me, young man?
287.483	I've heard of May-December romances,
287.483	but what are you, about 20 years old?
293.102	Eighteen? Eighteen years.
294.844	I think I have candies in my purse
294.844	older than 18 years old.
300.463	(Laughter)
304.281	I'm teasing you, sweetheart.
304.281	No, I'm comfortable with any question.
309.94	Sure. So about the prostitution --
309.94	oh, sex worker, sex worker.
315.951	No, just in my day, they called it
315.951	prostitution, not sex work.
319.92	Oh, because it includes pornography also?
322.666	Okay.
324.477	No, well, I guess when I was a girl,
326.659	we didn't really have
326.659	a name for that either.
329.167	We would have said dirty magazines,
329.167	I suppose, or dirty movies.
334.902	Well, it's not like what you have
334.902	with the Internet.
338.13	No, well, I don't mind sharing.
341.636	My late husband and I,
341.636	we were a very romantic couple.
347.898	Lots of tenderness, you understand.
351.794	Well, as you get older, you know,
351.794	at one point I thought my husband
355.164	might be helped by using
355.164	some of the pills men can take,
361.317	but he wasn't interested in those,
364.413	so I thought, what about maybe
364.413	watching an adult movie on the Internet?
370.474	Just for inspiration, you understand.
373.908	Well, at the time, neither of us
373.908	were very good on the computer,
378.906	so usually, if we needed help
378.906	with the Internet,
381.619	we would just call our children
381.619	or our grandchildren,
386.597	but obviously, in this case,
386.597	that wasn't an option,
390.163	so I thought, I'll have
390.163	a look myself, just to see.
395.588	How difficult could it be?
398.127	You search for certain key words
398.127	and you look --
401.76	Oh wow is right, young man.
403.955	You can't imagine what I saw.
406.672	Well, first of all, I was just trying
406.672	to find, you know, couples,
411.618	normal couples making love,
415.303	but this, so many people
415.303	together at one time.
419.791	You couldn't tell which part
419.791	belonged to which body.
423.599	How they even got the cameras to
423.599	capture some of this, I couldn't tell you.
427.778	But the one thing they didn't capture
427.778	was making love.
434.658	There was lots of making of something,
439.388	but they took the love part
439.388	right out of it, you know, the fun.
443.497	It was all very extreme, you know?
447.421	Like you would say,
447.421	with the extreme sports.
451.149	Lots of endurance,
454.778	but never tenderness.
457.8	So anyway, needless to say,
457.8	that was $19.95 I'll never get back again,
464.116	but it only showed up on the credit card
464.116	"as ""entertainment services,"""
468.945	so my husband was never the wiser,
471.732	and after all of that,
475.133	well, you could say it turned out
477.572	he didn't need the extra
477.572	inspiration after all.
483.152	Right, so next subject is a young woman
483.152	-- (Applause) --
487.924	Next subject, class,
487.924	is a young woman called Bella,
490.957	a university student interviewed in 2016
494.904	during what was called
494.904	an Intro to Feminist Porn class
498.828	as part of her major in sex work
498.828	at a college in the Bay Area.
503.317	(Laughter)
506.672	Yeah, I just want to, like,
506.672	get a recording of, like,
509.439	you guys recording me,
511.808	like a meta recording, or whatever.
514.887	It's just like this whole experience
514.887	is just, like, really amazing,
518.611	and I'd like to capture that
518.611	for, like, Instagram and my Tumblr.
522.131	So, like, hi guys, it's me, Bella,
525.126	and I am, like, being
525.126	interviewed right now
529.723	for this, like, really amazing
529.723	Bio-Empathetic Resonance Technology,
535.505	which is, like, basically where they are,
535.505	like, recording, as you can see
541.78	from these, whatever, like, electrodes,
543.702	the formation of, like, neuropeptides
543.702	in my hippocampus, or whatever.
550.16	They will later be able
550.16	to reconstitute these
552.92	as, like, my own actual memory,
552.92	like actual experiences,
559.54	so other people can, like,
559.54	actually feel what I'm feeling right now.
564.32	Okay. Okay.
566.572	So, like, hello, BERT person of the future
566.572	who is experiencing me.
572.75	This is what it feels like to be,
572.75	like, a college freshman,
576.557	and also the, like, headache
576.557	that you are experiencing through me
581.781	is the, like, residual effect
581.781	of the Jell-O shots which I had last night
588.2	at the bi-weekly feminist
588.2	pole dancing party
591.115	which I cohost on Wednesdays.
594.157	"It's called ""Don't Get All Pole-emical"" --"
594.157	(Laughter) --
597.779	and it's in Beekman Hall,
602.072	and, what else, like,
604.25	non-Jell-O shots are also
604.25	available for vegans,
608.297	and, oh, okay, yeah, totally, yeah, we
608.297	should also focus on your questions also.
617.98	So for your record, I am, like,
617.98	a sex work studies major
622.182	but minoring in social media
624.457	with a concentration
624.457	on notable YouTube memes.
627.151	(Laughter)
630.239	Yes, well, of course, like,
630.239	I consider myself to be, like,
633.49	obviously, like, a feminist.
635.579	I was named for Bella Abzug,
635.579	who was, like, a famous, like,
640.571	feminist from history,
642.986	and, like, also I feel that it is, like,
642.986	important to, like, represent women
649.255	who are, like, sex-positive feminists.
654.224	What is sex-negative?
656.941	Well, like, I guess I would ask,
656.941	like, what do you think
661.399	sex-negative is? (Laughter)
664.417	Yeah, because, like, the terms that we use
664.417	are, like, so important, because, like,
669.314	we call it sex work because it helps
669.314	people understand that, like, it's work,
676.352	and, like, you know, just like there are,
676.352	like, healthcare providers
681.228	and, like, insurance providers,
683.712	like, we think of these workers
683.712	as, like, sex care providers.
690.511	Yeah, but like, I don't think of myself
690.511	like, providing direct
694.184	sex care services per se as, like,
694.184	being a requirement
698.433	for me to be, like, an advocate.
700.894	Like, I support other women's right
700.894	to choose it voluntarily, like,
704.563	if they enjoy it.
706.676	Yeah, but, like, I see
706.676	myself going forward
709.509	as more likely, like,
709.509	protecting sex workers',
713.247	like, legal freedoms and rights.
716.288	Yeah, so, like, basically,
716.288	I'm planning on becoming a lawyer.
722.133	Right, class. (Laughter) (Applause)
723.835	So these next two modules
723.835	are also circa 2016.
727.921	One subject is an Irishwoman
727.921	with a particularly noteworthy
731.915	relationship to this issue,
734.847	but first will be a West Indian woman,
738.509	a self-described escort
740.831	who was recorded at a
740.831	sex workers' rights rally and parade.
746.241	She was interviewed whilst marching
746.241	in full carnival headdress
750.792	and very little else.
756.295	All right, you want me
756.295	to start talking now.
758.379	Yeah, I told you, you can
758.379	put those wires anywhere you want to
761.509	as long as it don't get in the way.
765.164	Yeah, no, but, tell me again
765.164	what the name of -- BERT? BERT.
770.069	Yeah, I was telling you, you know,
770.069	I think I have in all my time
773.108	I have had at least one client with that
773.108	name, so this won't be the first time
776.797	I had BERT all over me.
783.905	Oh, I'm sorry,
785.218	but you got to get into the spirit of it
785.218	if you're going to interview me.
788.67	All right? You can say it.
790.536	No justice, no piece!
790.536	No justice, no piece!
792.934	But you see the sign? You get it?
792.934	P-I-E-C-E. No justice, no piece of us.
798.878	You understand?
800.79	Right, so that's the part
800.79	where I was telling you
803.244	is that when I first came to this country,
803.244	I worked every job I could find.
807.609	I was a nanny; I was a home care attendant
807.609	for all these different old people,
812.299	and then I said, child, if I have to touch
812.299	another white man's backside,
816.422	I might as well get paid
816.422	a lot more money for it than this,
819.381	you understand?
821.285	Pshh, you know how hard it is
821.285	being a domestic worker?
824.98	Some of these men, they're heavy.
826.729	You have to pick them up
826.729	and flip them over.
829.528	Now, I let them pick me up
829.528	and flip me over, you understand?
833.986	Well, you have to have a sense of humor
833.986	about it, that's what I think.
837.399	No, but see, listen,
839.349	you find me somebody who don't hate
839.349	some part of their job.
842.739	I mean, there's a lot of things
842.739	about this job that I hate,
845.502	but the money is not one of them,
847.072	and I will tell you, as long as this
847.072	is the best possibility
849.891	for me to make real money,
851.655	I am going to be Jamaican-No-Fakin'
851.655	if that's what they want to call me.
855.811	No, I'm not even from Jamaica.
855.811	That's how they market me.
859.318	My family is from Trinidad
859.318	and the Virgin Islands.
863.495	They don't know what I do,
863.495	but you know what?
865.711	My children, they know
865.711	that their school fees are paid,
868.977	they have their books and their computer,
871.484	and this way, I know
871.484	that they have a chance.
874.456	So I'm not going to tell you
874.456	that what I do, it's easy,
877.266	I'm not going to tell you that I feel --
877.266	what's that you said, liberated?
882.128	But I'm going to tell you
882.128	that I feel paid.
886.12	Right. (Applause)
890.872	Thanks, that's lovely,
890.872	and just the cup of tea, love,
893.496	and just a splash of the whiskey.
895.47	It's perfect, that's grand.
895.47	Just a drop more. A splash. Perfect.
900.2	What was your name? Peter?
900.2	Is that right, so, Peter?
903.55	Right. So that, that is
903.55	the unique part of it for me,
906.708	right, is that I ended up in both,
910.681	first in the convent, and then
910.681	in the prostitution after. That's right.
914.55	(Laughter)
916.16	So one woman at the university
916.16	here in Dublin, she wrote about me.
920.12	She said, Maureen Fitzroy is the living
920.12	embodiment of the whore-virgin dichotomy.
925.82	Right? (Laughter)
927.341	Doesn't it sound like something
927.341	you need to go into hospital?
930.359	Well, I've got this terrible dichotomy.
932.248	Doesn't it.
933.781	Right. Well, for me though, it was,
933.781	as a girl, it started with me dad.
937.119	I mean, half the time, when he
937.119	spoke to us, it was just a sort of
940.394	tell us we were all useless rotten idiots
940.394	and we had no morals, that type of thing.
944.856	And I certainly didn't
944.856	do myself any favors.
948.177	By the time I was 16,
950.406	I had started messing about
950.406	with this older fella,
953.285	and he wanted it to be
953.285	our little secret,
956.837	and I did as I was told, didn't I,
959.345	and when that got back to me dad, he
959.345	had me sent straightaway to the convent.
966.752	Well no, that older fella, he would still
966.752	come to find me in the convent.
971.17	Yeah, he'd leave me notes
972.766	tucked into the holes in the brick
972.766	at the back of the charity shop
976.001	so we could meet.
977.188	And he'd tell me how
977.188	he's leaving his wife,
980.915	and I believed him, until I got pregnant.
985.141	I did, Peter, and I left him a note
985.141	about it in our special place there,
990.458	and I never did hear from him again.
993.477	No, I gave it up for adoption
993.477	so it could have a decent life,
999.07	and then they wouldn't let me
999.07	back into the convent.
1002.815	No, my one sister Virginia gave me
1002.815	a fiver for the coach to Dublin,
1006.273	and that's how I ended up here.
1008.991	Well, surprise, surprise, I fell in love
1008.991	with another fella much older than me,
1013.12	and I always say I was just so happy
1013.12	because he didn't drink,
1019.349	I married the bastard.
1022.502	Well, he didn't drink, but he did have
1022.502	just the wee heroin problem, didn't he,
1026.184	and -- That's right, and before I knew it,
1029.279	he was the one who turned me on
1029.279	to the prostitution, my own husband.
1033.703	He had me supporting the both of us.
1035.771	I was 18.
1038.144	Well, it wasn't Pretty Woman,
1038.144	I can tell you that.
1042.509	That Julia Roberts,
1045.566	if she'd ever had to sleep with a man
1045.566	to put a few pounds in her pocket,
1049.569	I don't think she'd ever
1049.569	have made that film.
1052.11	Well, for your record,
1054.339	my opinion of the legalization,
1054.339	I'd say I'm against it.
1058.62	I just, I don't care what
1058.62	these young girls say.
1060.864	You know, living like that,
1060.864	you're just lost,
1063.975	and, you know, I'm 63 years old.
1066.483	I'm still trying to find who I am.
1069.503	You know, I never was a wife or a nun,
1073.24	or a prostitute even, really, not really.
1076.56	Nobody ever asked who I wanted to be.
1079.648	They just told me,
1081.482	and if you legalize it,
1083.433	then you're really telling these girls,
1083.433	"""Go on and get lost for a living,"""
1087.264	and a lot of them,
1087.264	they'll do as they're told.
1090.612	All right, so four perspectives
1090.612	from four quite -- (Applause) --
1095.669	four quite different voices there, right?
1097.829	One woman saying sex itself is natural
1097.829	but the sex industry seems to
1102.786	mechanize or industrialize it.
1104.794	Then the second woman considered
1104.794	sex work to be empowering,
1109.162	liberating, and feminist,
1109.162	though she, herself, notably,
1112.991	did not seem keen to do it.
1115.568	The third woman, who actually was
1115.568	a so-called sex worker
1119.995	did not agree that it was liberating
1119.995	but she wanted the right
1123.34	to the economic empowerment,
1125.1	and then we hear the fourth woman
1125.1	saying not only prostitution itself
1128.412	but proscribed roles for women in general
1130.938	prevented her from ever
1130.938	finding who she was, right?
1134.398	So another fact most people did not know
1136.395	was the average age of an at-risk girl
1136.395	being introduced to the sex industry
1142.08	was 12 or 13.
1144.11	Also consider that the age
1144.11	when all girls in that society
1147.146	first became exposed
1147.146	to sexualized images of women
1150.791	was quite a bit earlier, right?
1153.345	This was a doll called Barbie, right?
1158.105	I initially thought she was an educational
1158.105	tool for anorexia prevention --
1161.692	(Laughter) --
1162.842	but actually she was considered by many
1166.209	to be a wholesome symbol of femininity,
1170.272	and often young girls began
1170.272	what was called dieting.
1173.615	Remember this? This was
1173.615	restricting food intake on purpose
1177.854	by the age of six,
1179.234	and defining themselves
1179.234	based on attractiveness
1182.061	by around that same time. Right?
1183.901	Yes?
1185.712	Right, Bradley, okay, excellent point.
1187.756	So there was a lucrative market
1187.756	in that society in convincing all people
1192.585	they had to look a certain way
1192.585	to even have a sex life, right?
1196.463	But girls, especially, were expected
1196.463	"to be ""sexy"" while avoiding"
1201.618	"being perceived as ""sluts"""
1201.618	for being sexual. Right?
1204.97	So there's that shame piece
1204.97	we've heard about.
1207.237	Yes.
1208.839	Valerie, right? Okay, very good.
1210.696	Of course, men were having sex as well,
1213.506	but you'll remember from the reading,
1215.944	what were male sluts called?
1218.675	Very good, they were called men.
1220.541	(Laughter) (Applause)
1222.747	So not easy living in
1222.747	a world like that, right?
1228.859	Though it was not all bad news either.
1230.711	Most women in the early 2000s
1230.711	considered themselves empowered,
1234.217	and men generally felt they were
1234.217	also evolved in this area,
1238.45	and, in fact, most people would have
1238.45	been aware of issues
1241.3	like human trafficking, for example,
1243.235	but they would have seen that
1243.235	as quite separate
1245.636	from more recreational
1245.636	adult entertainment.
1248.427	And so we'll just very briefly, class --
1248.427	we don't have a lot of time --
1251.85	we'll just very briefly hear from a man
1254.065	on our topic at this stage.
1255.839	So this next subject was interviewed
1255.839	on the night of his bachelor party.
1263.426	Dude, can you, all right,
1263.426	can you just keep it down?
1266.979	I'm trying to talk to BERT right now.
1269.185	Oh, your name's not BERT.
1271.298	BERT's the name of the, oh, all right.
1273.573	No, no, no, totally, it's totally fine.
1273.573	I'm mostly sober,
1276.638	so I just want to be helpful.
1280.073	Yeah, and I totally believe in causes,
1280.073	yeah, like, all that stuff.
1283.892	(Laughter)
1285.332	And actually, I'm wearing Toms right now.
1288.954	Yeah, Toms, like, the shoes,
1292.56	like, you buy a pair and then
1292.56	a kid in Africa gets clean water.
1296.857	Yeah. Totally.
1298.394	But what was the question again? Sorry.
1301.181	Of course I believe in women's rights.
1301.181	I'm marrying a woman.
1305.889	(Laughter)
1308.389	No, but I mean, like, just because
1308.389	I'm in a strip club parking lot
1312.018	doesn't mean that I'm, like,
1312.018	a sexist or whatever.
1315.042	My fiancee is totally amazing,
1315.042	she's totally a strong girl, woman,
1319.454	smart woman, like, the whole thing.
1321.949	Yeah, she knows I'm here. She's probably
1321.949	at a strip club herself right now,
1325.518	like, as a joke, same as me.
1327.51	My best man, I told him
1327.51	he could surprise me,
1329.602	and he thought this would be hilarious,
1331.597	but this is not something.
1334.35	Yeah, we all went to B school together.
1337.06	Wharton.
1338.54	(Laughter)
1339.724	Yeah, so, dude, can you guys --
1342.171	All right, but it's my bachelor party,
1344.087	and I can spend it in the parking lot
1344.087	with Anderson Cooper if I want to.
1347.595	All right, I'll see you in there.
1351.076	All right, okay, so Anderson,
1353.214	so, like, first of all, stripping,
1357.111	but then, like, all the other things
1357.111	you're talking about,
1359.895	prostitution and all that stuff,
1359.895	that's, like, not the same thing at all.
1363.403	You know? Like, you keep calling it
1363.403	the sex industry or whatever,
1366.659	but it's like, if the girl wants
1366.659	to be an exotic dancer
1370.605	and she's 18, like, that's her right.
1375.092	Whoa, whoa, I hear what you're saying,
1375.092	but I just feel like people,
1378.34	they just want to make it seem
1378.34	like all dudes are just, like, predators,
1381.976	that we would just automatically
1381.976	go to a prostitute, or whatever.
1385.114	Even, like, when I pledged, you know,
1385.114	like when I rushed my fraternity.
1390.35	My brothers who I'm close to,
1390.35	those guys, they're all like me.
1393.337	We're just normal people, but, like,
1393.337	there's this myth that you must
1397.29	be that guy who is kind of an asshole,
1397.29	and like, all bros before hos or whatever.
1401.928	And actually, like, bros before hos,
1401.928	it doesn't mean like what it sounds like.
1406.603	It's actually just like a joking way of
1406.603	saying that you care about your brothers
1410.38	and you put them first.
1413.466	Yeah, but, you can't blame
1413.466	the media, either.
1415.576	I mean, like, if you
1415.576	"go watch ""Hangover 2,"""
1418.11	and you think that's an instruction manual
1420.264	for your life, like,
1420.264	I don't know what to tell you.
1422.8	You know? You don't
1422.8	"watch ""Bourne Identity"""
1424.862	and go drive your car
1424.862	over a gondola in Venice. (Laughter)
1429.736	Well, yeah, okay, like, if you're
1429.736	a little kid or whatever,
1432.672	of course it's different, but --
1434.876	Yeah, all right, I remember
1434.876	one thing like that.
1439.38	I was at this kid's house
1439.38	one time playing GTA,
1443.28	uh, Grand Theft Auto?
1445.417	Dude, are you from Canada? (Laughter)
1449.593	So, like, whatever, with Grand Theft Auto,
1452.986	you're this kid, like, you're this guy
1452.986	walking around or whatever,
1456.16	and you can basically, like,
1456.16	the more cops you kill,
1459.092	the more points you get,
1459.092	and stuff like that.
1461.763	But also, you can find prostitutes
1464.601	and obviously you can do
1464.601	sexual stuff with them,
1467.798	but you can, like, kill them
1467.798	and take your money back.
1472.525	Yeah, this kid, I remember he ran over
1472.525	a couple of them a few times with his car
1476.466	and he got all these points.
1479.32	We were, like, 10, I think.
1483.685	It felt pretty terrible, actually.
1486.827	No, I don't think I said anything,
1486.827	I just finished playing and went home.
1492.845	All right class, so then there were men
1492.845	who had more than just
1495.77	a passing relationship to this issue.
1495.77	(Laughter)
1499.955	The next subject described himself
1499.955	as a reformed and remorseful pimp
1504.88	turned motivational speaker,
1506.526	life coach and therapist,
1508.964	but if you want to know more about him,
1508.964	you'll have to come to the entire play.
1512.934	Thank you so much,
1512.934	you beautiful TED audience.
1516.92	"I will see you for ""Sell/Buy/Date."""
1518.716	(Applause)
