12.829	I teach chemistry.
15.048	(Explosion)
16.414	All right, all right.
19.572	So more than just explosions,
21.853	chemistry is everywhere.
23.464	Have you ever found yourself at a restaurant spacing out
26.104	just doing this over and over?
28.449	Some people nodding yes.
30.654	Recently, I showed this to my students,
32.982	and I just asked them to try and explain why it happened.
37.331	The questions and conversations that followed
39.952	were fascinating.
41.603	Check out this video that Maddie
43.417	from my period three class sent me that evening.
57.104	(Clang) (Laughs)
59.569	Now obviously, as Maddie's chemistry teacher,
62.763	I love that she went home and continued to geek out
65.869	about this kind of ridiculous demonstration
68.487	that we did in class.
69.909	But what fascinated me more is that Maddie's curiosity
72.855	took her to a new level.
74.549	If you look inside that beaker,
76.682	you might see a candle.
78.242	Maddie's using temperature to extend this phenomenon
81.251	to a new scenario.
84.028	You know, questions and curiosity like Maddie's
87.266	are magnets that draw us towards our teachers,
90.232	and they transcend all technology
93.184	or buzzwords in education.
96.325	But if we place these technologies before student inquiry,
100.426	we can be robbing ourselves
102.549	of our greatest tool as teachers: our students' questions.
107.483	For example, flipping a boring lecture from the classroom
111.863	to the screen of a mobile device
113.64	might save instructional time,
115.477	but if it is the focus of our students' experience,
118.376	it's the same dehumanizing chatter
121.496	just wrapped up in fancy clothing.
123.728	But if instead we have the guts
126.003	to confuse our students, perplex them,
128.873	and evoke real questions,
131.149	through those questions, we as teachers have information
134.149	that we can use to tailor robust
137.177	and informed methods of blended instruction.
140.868	So, 21st-century lingo jargon mumbo jumbo aside,
146.04	the truth is, I've been teaching for 13 years now,
150.244	and it took a life-threatening situation
152.718	to snap me out of 10 years of pseudo-teaching
155.665	and help me realize that student questions
159.28	are the seeds of real learning,
162.401	not some scripted curriculum
164.515	that gave them tidbits of random information.
167.811	In May of 2010, at 35 years old,
171.283	with a two-year-old at home and my second child on the way,
174.376	I was diagnosed with a large aneurysm
176.992	at the base of my thoracic aorta.
179.512	This led to open-heart surgery. This is the actual real email
182.564	from my doctor right there.
184.098	Now, when I got this, I was -- press Caps Lock --
187.623	absolutely freaked out, okay?
190.088	But I found surprising moments of comfort
194.307	in the confidence that my surgeon embodied.
197.997	Where did this guy get this confidence, the audacity of it?
201.441	So when I asked him, he told me three things.
205.033	He said first, his curiosity drove him
208.415	to ask hard questions about the procedure,
210.69	about what worked and what didn't work.
213.875	Second, he embraced, and didn't fear,
216.969	the messy process of trial and error,
219.045	the inevitable process of trial and error.
221.554	And third, through intense reflection,
224.53	he gathered the information that he needed
227.206	to design and revise the procedure,
229.112	and then, with a steady hand, he saved my life.
232.633	Now I absorbed a lot from these words of wisdom,
236.309	and before I went back into the classroom that fall,
238.289	I wrote down three rules of my own
241.547	that I bring to my lesson planning still today.
244.327	Rule number one: Curiosity comes first.
248.369	Questions can be windows to great instruction,
251.468	but not the other way around.
254.158	Rule number two: Embrace the mess.
257.792	We're all teachers. We know learning is ugly.
260.463	And just because the scientific method is allocated
263.334	to page five of section 1.2 of chapter one
266.785	of the one that we all skip, okay,
270.24	trial and error can still be an informal part
273.442	of what we do every single day
275.359	at Sacred Heart Cathedral in room 206.
278.691	And rule number three: Practice reflection.
282.713	What we do is important. It deserves our care,
285.057	but it also deserves our revision.
288.289	Can we be the surgeons of our classrooms?
291.067	As if what we are doing one day will save lives.
294.063	Our students our worth it.
295.614	And each case is different.
298.049	(Explosion)
299.144	All right. Sorry.
301.091	The chemistry teacher in me just needed to get that
302.999	out of my system before we move on.
305.834	So these are my daughters.
307.619	On the right we have little Emmalou -- Southern family.
311.291	And, on the left, Riley.
314.073	Now Riley's going to be a big girl in a couple weeks here.
316.728	She's going to be four years old,
318.422	and anyone who knows a four-year-old
320.672	"knows that they love to ask, ""Why?"""
323.872	Yeah. Why.
325.356	I could teach this kid anything
327.666	because she is curious about everything.
330.516	We all were at that age.
332.999	But the challenge is really for Riley's future teachers,
336.474	the ones she has yet to meet.
339.296	How will they grow this curiosity?
341.788	You see, I would argue that Riley is a metaphor for all kids,
347.27	and I think dropping out of school comes in many different forms --
350.664	to the senior who's checked out before the year's even begun
353.988	or that empty desk in the back of an urban middle school's classroom.
359.006	But if we as educators leave behind
361.681	this simple role as disseminators of content
364.263	and embrace a new paradigm
366.6	as cultivators of curiosity and inquiry,
369.644	we just might bring a little bit more meaning
371.869	to their school day, and spark their imagination.
374.584	Thank you very much.
376.168	(Applause)
