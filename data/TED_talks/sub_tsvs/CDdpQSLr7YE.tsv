12.904	Hello, everybody.
14.333	I brought with me today a baby diaper.
18.793	You'll see why in a second.
20.539	Baby diapers have interesting properties.
22.573	They can swell enormously
22.573	when you add water to them,
25.288	an experiment done
25.288	by millions of kids every day.
28.296	(Laughter)
29.47	But the reason why
30.988	is that they're designed
30.988	in a very clever way.
33.202	They're made out of a thing
33.202	called a swellable material.
35.861	It's a special kind of material that,
35.861	when you add water,
38.622	it will swell up enormously,
40.076	maybe a thousand times in volume.
42.266	And this is a very useful,
42.266	industrial kind of polymer.
45.819	But what we're trying to do
45.819	in my group at MIT
48.369	is to figure out if we can do
48.369	something similar to the brain.
51.606	Can we make it bigger,
52.789	big enough that you
52.789	can peer inside
54.481	and see all the tiny building blocks,
54.481	the biomolecules,
57.133	how they're organized in three dimensions,
59.308	the structure, the ground truth
59.308	structure of the brain, if you will?
62.817	If we could get that,
63.999	maybe we could have a better understanding
63.999	of how the brain is organized
67.532	to yield thoughts and emotions
69.215	and actions and sensations.
70.958	Maybe we could try to pinpoint
70.958	the exact changes in the brain
74.397	that result in diseases,
76.197	diseases like Alzheimer's
76.197	and epilepsy and Parkinson's,
79.433	for which there are few
79.433	treatments, much less cures,
82.035	and for which, very often,
82.035	we don't know the cause or the origins
85.676	and what's really causing them to occur.
88.613	Now, our group at MIT
90.377	is trying to take
90.377	a different point of view
93.087	from the way neuroscience has
93.087	been done over the last hundred years.
96.341	We're designers. We're inventors.
97.944	We're trying to figure out
97.944	how to build technologies
100.512	that let us look at and repair the brain.
102.992	And the reason is,
104.167	the brain is incredibly,
104.167	incredibly complicated.
107.484	So what we've learned
107.484	over the first century of neuroscience
110.395	is that the brain is a very
110.395	complicated network,
112.722	made out of very specialized
112.722	cells called neurons
115.226	with very complex geometries,
116.917	and electrical currents will flow
116.917	through these complexly shaped neurons.
121.653	Furthermore, neurons
121.653	are connected in networks.
124.461	They're connected by little junctions
124.461	called synapses that exchange chemicals
128.32	and allow the neurons
128.32	to talk to each other.
130.562	The density of the brain is incredible.
132.526	In a cubic millimeter of your brain,
134.857	there are about 100,000 of these neurons
137.338	and maybe a billion of those connections.
140.887	But it's worse.
142.293	So, if you could zoom in to a neuron,
144.622	and, of course, this is just
144.622	our artist's rendition of it.
147.396	What you would see are thousands
147.396	and thousands of kinds of biomolecules,
151.627	little nanoscale machines
151.627	organized in complex, 3D patterns,
156.051	and together they mediate
156.051	those electrical pulses,
158.703	those chemical exchanges
158.703	that allow neurons to work together
162.664	to generate things like thoughts
162.664	and feelings and so forth.
166.357	Now, we don't know how
166.357	the neurons in the brain are organized
170.145	to form networks,
171.343	and we don't know how
171.343	the biomolecules are organized
173.867	within neurons
175.065	to form these complex, organized machines.
177.918	If we really want to understand this,
179.762	we're going to need new technologies.
181.603	But if we could get such maps,
183.411	if we could look at the organization
183.411	of molecules and neurons
186.378	and neurons and networks,
187.968	maybe we could really understand
187.968	how the brain conducts information
191.429	from sensory regions,
192.62	mixes it with emotion and feeling,
194.38	and generates our decisions and actions.
197.131	Maybe we could pinpoint the exact set
197.131	of molecular changes that occur
200.944	in a brain disorder.
202.17	And once we know how
202.17	those molecules have changed,
205.016	whether they've increased in number
205.016	or changed in pattern,
207.82	we could use those
207.82	as targets for new drugs,
210.783	for new ways of delivering
210.783	energy into the brain
213.078	in order to repair the brain
213.078	computations that are afflicted
216.982	in patients who suffer
216.982	from brain disorders.
219.793	We've all seen lots of different
219.793	technologies over the last century
223.06	to try to confront this.
224.25	I think we've all seen brain scans
226.154	taken using MRI machines.
228.212	These, of course, have the great power
228.212	that they are noninvasive,
231.583	they can be used on living human subjects.
234.407	But also, they're spatially crude.
236.662	Each of these blobs that you see,
236.662	or voxels, as they're called,
239.676	can contain millions
239.676	and millions of neurons.
242.389	So it's not at the level of resolution
244.263	where it can pinpoint
244.263	the molecular changes that occur
246.825	or the changes in the wiring
246.825	of these networks
249.135	that contributes to our ability
249.135	to be conscious and powerful beings.
253.797	At the other extreme,
253.797	you have microscopes.
257.002	Microscopes, of course, will use light
257.002	to look at little tiny things.
260.321	For centuries, they've been used
260.321	to look at things like bacteria.
263.42	For neuroscience,
264.595	microscopes are actually how neurons
264.595	were discovered in the first place,
268.031	about 130 years ago.
269.347	But light is fundamentally limited.
271.689	You can't see individual molecules
271.689	with a regular old microscope.
275.011	You can't look at these tiny connections.
277.187	So if we want to make our ability
277.187	to see the brain more powerful,
281.153	to get down to the ground truth structure,
283.345	we're going to need to have
283.345	even better technologies.
287.611	My group, a couple years ago,
287.611	started thinking:
289.859	Why don't we do the opposite?
291.295	If it's so darn complicated
291.295	to zoom in to the brain,
293.78	why can't we make the brain bigger?
296.166	It initially started
297.345	with two grad students in my group,
297.345	Fei Chen and Paul Tillberg.
300.365	Now many others in my group
300.365	are helping with this process.
303.109	We decided to try to figure out
303.109	if we could take polymers,
305.895	like the stuff in the baby diaper,
307.548	and install it physically
307.548	within the brain.
309.578	If we could do it just right,
309.578	and you add water,
311.843	you can potentially blow the brain up
313.702	to where you could distinguish
313.702	those tiny biomolecules from each other.
317.103	You would see those connections
317.103	and get maps of the brain.
319.997	This could potentially be quite dramatic.
322.009	We brought a little demo here.
325.538	We got some purified baby diaper material.
328.137	It's much easier
328.137	just to buy it off the Internet
330.435	than to extract the few grains
330.435	that actually occur in these diapers.
333.934	I'm going to put just one teaspoon here
336.706	of this purified polymer.
339.27	And here we have some water.
341.446	What we're going to do
342.632	is see if this teaspoon
342.632	of the baby diaper material
345.667	can increase in size.
348.687	You're going to see it increase in volume
348.687	by about a thousandfold
352.407	before your very eyes.
361.597	I could pour much more of this in there,
363.593	but I think you've got the idea
365.175	that this is a very,
365.175	very interesting molecule,
367.701	and if can use it in the right way,
369.637	we might be able
369.637	to really zoom in on the brain
371.982	in a way that you can't do
371.982	with past technologies.
375.227	OK. So a little bit of chemistry now.
377.305	What's going on
377.305	in the baby diaper polymer?
379.771	If you could zoom in,
381.471	it might look something like
381.471	what you see on the screen.
384.168	Polymers are chains of atoms
384.168	arranged in long, thin lines.
388.684	The chains are very tiny,
390.075	about the width of a biomolecule,
391.963	and these polymers are really dense.
393.734	They're separated by distances
395.258	that are around the size of a biomolecule.
397.534	This is very good
398.723	because we could potentially
398.723	move everything apart in the brain.
401.788	If we add water, what will happen is,
403.66	this swellable material
403.66	is going to absorb the water,
406.199	the polymer chains will move
406.199	apart from each other,
408.623	and the entire material
408.623	is going to become bigger.
411.615	And because these chains are so tiny
413.453	and spaced by biomolecular distances,
415.682	we could potentially blow up the brain
417.745	and make it big enough to see.
420.02	Here's the mystery, then:
421.284	How do we actually make
421.284	these polymer chains inside the brain
424.918	so we can move all the biomolecules apart?
427.181	If we could do that,
428.356	maybe we could get
428.356	ground truth maps of the brain.
430.777	We could look at the wiring.
432.19	We can peer inside
432.19	and see the molecules within.
435.925	To explain this, we made some animations
438.43	where we actually look
438.43	at, in these artist renderings,
441.057	what biomolecules might look
441.057	like and how we might separate them.
444.622	Step one: what we'd have
444.622	to do, first of all,
447.195	is attach every biomolecule,
447.195	shown in brown here,
450.608	to a little anchor, a little handle.
452.791	We need to pull the molecules
452.791	of the brain apart from each other,
455.91	and to do that, we need
455.91	to have a little handle
458.26	that allows those polymers to bind to them
460.569	and to exert their force.
463.278	Now, if you just take baby diaper
463.278	polymer and dump it on the brain,
466.463	obviously, it's going to sit there on top.
468.524	So we need to find a way
468.524	to make the polymers inside.
471.076	And this is where we're really lucky.
472.888	It turns out, you can
472.888	get the building blocks,
475.1	monomers, as they're called,
476.496	and if you let them go into the brain
478.304	and then trigger the chemical reactions,
480.364	you can get them to form
480.364	those long chains,
483.09	right there inside the brain tissue.
485.325	They're going to wind their way
485.325	around biomolecules
487.746	and between biomolecules,
488.991	forming those complex webs
490.64	that will allow you, eventually,
490.64	to pull apart the molecules
493.526	from each other.
494.725	And every time one
494.725	of those little handles is around,
497.803	the polymer will bind to the handle,
497.803	and that's exactly what we need
501.177	in order to pull the molecules
501.177	apart from each other.
503.732	All right, the moment of truth.
505.449	We have to treat this specimen
507.621	with a chemical to kind of loosen up
507.621	all the molecules from each other,
511.091	and then, when we add water,
512.951	that swellable material is going
512.951	to start absorbing the water,
515.928	the polymer chains will move apart,
517.655	but now, the biomolecules
517.655	will come along for the ride.
520.401	And much like drawing
520.401	a picture on a balloon,
522.589	and then you blow up the balloon,
524.2	the image is the same,
525.514	but the ink particles have moved
525.514	away from each other.
528.086	And that's what we've been able
528.086	to do now, but in three dimensions.
531.577	There's one last trick.
533.6	As you can see here,
534.842	we've color-coded
534.842	all the biomolecules brown.
536.975	That's because they all
536.975	kind of look the same.
539.169	Biomolecules are made
539.169	out of the same atoms,
541.298	but just in different orders.
543.562	So we need one last thing
545.086	in order to make them visible.
546.805	We have to bring in little tags,
548.408	with glowing dyes
548.408	that will distinguish them.
551.451	So one kind of biomolecule
551.451	might get a blue color.
554.148	Another kind of biomolecule
554.148	might get a red color.
556.523	And so forth.
557.823	And that's the final step.
559.399	Now we can look at something like a brain
561.701	and look at the individual molecules,
563.521	because we've moved them
563.521	far apart enough from each other
566.252	that we can tell them apart.
567.974	So the hope here is that
567.974	we can make the invisible visible.
570.832	We can turn things that might seem
570.832	small and obscure
573.422	and blow them up
574.597	until they're like constellations
574.597	of information about life.
577.798	Here's an actual video
577.798	of what it might look like.
580.197	We have here a little brain in a dish --
582.592	a little piece of a brain, actually.
584.363	We've infused the polymer in,
585.983	and now we're adding water.
587.474	What you'll see is that,
587.474	right before your eyes --
589.856	this video is sped up about sixtyfold --
591.803	this little piece of brain tissue
591.803	is going to grow.
594.552	It can increase by a hundredfold
594.552	or even more in volume.
597.756	And the cool part is, because
597.756	those polymers are so tiny,
600.729	we're separating biomolecules
600.729	evenly from each other.
603.312	It's a smooth expansion.
604.994	We're not losing the configuration
604.994	of the information.
607.705	We're just making it easier to see.
611.333	So now we can take
611.333	actual brain circuitry --
613.533	here's a piece of the brain
613.533	involved with, for example, memory --
616.691	and we can zoom in.
617.978	We can start to actually look at
617.978	how circuits are configured.
620.892	Maybe someday we could read out a memory.
622.884	Maybe we could actually look
622.884	at how circuits are configured
625.687	to process emotions,
626.863	how the actual wiring
626.863	of our brain is organized
629.809	in order to make us who we are.
632.4	And of course, we can pinpoint, hopefully,
634.471	the actual problems in the brain
634.471	at a molecular level.
637.654	What if we could actually
637.654	look into cells in the brain
640.247	and figure out, wow, here are the 17
640.247	molecules that have altered
643.354	in this brain tissue that has been
643.354	undergoing epilepsy
646.833	or changing in Parkinson's disease
648.507	or otherwise being altered?
650.048	If we get that systematic list
650.048	of things that are going wrong,
653.115	those become our therapeutic targets.
655.338	We can build drugs that bind those.
657.039	We can maybe aim energy
657.039	at different parts of the brain
659.69	in order to help people
659.69	with Parkinson's or epilepsy
662.401	or other conditions that affect
662.401	over a billion people
664.976	around the world.
667.246	Now, something interesting
667.246	has been happening.
669.476	It turns out that throughout biomedicine,
672.205	there are other problems
672.205	that expansion might help with.
674.895	This is an actual biopsy
674.895	from a human breast cancer patient.
678.505	It turns out that if you look at cancers,
680.717	if you look at the immune system,
682.352	if you look at aging,
682.352	if you look at development --
684.889	all these processes are involving
684.889	large-scale biological systems.
689.41	But of course, the problems begin
689.41	with those little nanoscale molecules,
693.458	the machines that make the cells
693.458	and the organs in our body tick.
697.351	So what we're trying
697.351	to do now is to figure out
699.597	if we can actually use this technology
699.597	to map the building blocks of life
703.087	in a wide variety of diseases.
704.856	Can we actually pinpoint
704.856	the molecular changes in a tumor
707.776	so that we can actually
707.776	go after it in a smart way
710.169	and deliver drugs that might wipe out
710.169	exactly the cells that we want to?
714.137	You know, a lot of medicine
714.137	is very high risk.
716.496	Sometimes, it's even guesswork.
718.626	My hope is we can actually turn
718.626	what might be a high-risk moon shot
722.525	into something that's more reliable.
724.318	If you think about the original moon shot,
726.397	where they actually landed on the moon,
728.319	it was based on solid science.
729.787	We understood gravity;
731.414	we understood aerodynamics.
732.779	We knew how to build rockets.
734.198	The science risk was under control.
736.69	It was still a great, great
736.69	feat of engineering.
739.467	But in medicine, we don't
739.467	necessarily have all the laws.
742.136	Do we have all the laws
742.136	that are analogous to gravity,
745.269	that are analogous to aerodynamics?
747.637	I would argue that with technologies
749.391	like the kinds I'm talking about today,
751.287	maybe we can actually derive those.
753.004	We can map the patterns
753.004	that occur in living systems,
755.885	and figure out how to overcome
755.885	the diseases that plague us.
761.499	You know, my wife and I
761.499	have two young kids,
763.602	and one of my hopes as a bioengineer
763.602	is to make life better for them
766.86	than it currently is for us.
768.613	And my hope is, if we can
768.613	turn biology and medicine
772.367	from these high-risk endeavors
772.367	that are governed by chance and luck,
776.748	and make them things
776.748	that we win by skill and hard work,
780.699	then that would be a great advance.
782.621	Thank you very much.
783.851	(Applause)
