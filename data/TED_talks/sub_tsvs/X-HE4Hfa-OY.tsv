15.917	Some years ago, I set out to try to understand
18.419	if there was a possibility to develop biofuels
21.147	on a scale that would actually compete with fossil fuels
25.849	but not compete with agriculture for water,
29.533	fertilizer or land.
31.971	So here's what I came up with.
33.501	Imagine that we build an enclosure where we put it
35.109	just underwater, and we fill it with wastewater
37.387	and some form of microalgae that produces oil,
40.515	and we make it out of some kind of flexible material
42.675	that moves with waves underwater,
44.747	and the system that we're going to build, of course,
46.787	will use solar energy to grow the algae,
49.107	and they use CO2, which is good,
51.318	and they produce oxygen as they grow.
53.683	The algae that grow are in a container that
57.347	distributes the heat to the surrounding water,
60.139	and you can harvest them and make biofuels
62.403	and cosmetics and fertilizer and animal feed,
65.083	and of course you'd have to make a large area of this,
67.923	so you'd have to worry about other stakeholders
70.475	like fishermen and ships and such things, but hey,
74.667	we're talking about biofuels,
76.93	and we know the importance of potentially getting
79.132	an alternative liquid fuel.
81.611	Why are we talking about microalgae?
84.292	Here you see a graph showing you the different types
87.979	of crops that are being considered for making biofuels,
91.831	so you can see some things like soybean,
94.394	which makes 50 gallons per acre per year,
96.711	or sunflower or canola or jatropha or palm, and that
101.768	tall graph there shows what microalgae can contribute.
106.262	That is to say, microalgae contributes between 2,000
108.793	and 5,000 gallons per acre per year,
111.585	compared to the 50 gallons per acre per year from soy.
114.937	So what are microalgae? Microalgae are micro --
118.201	that is, they're extremely small, as you can see here
120.649	a picture of those single-celled organisms
123.617	compared to a human hair.
125.927	Those small organisms have been around
128.753	for millions of years and there's thousands
130.793	of different species of microalgae in the world,
133.017	some of which are the fastest-growing plants on the planet,
136.041	and produce, as I just showed you, lots and lots of oil.
139.233	Now, why do we want to do this offshore?
142.521	Well, the reason we're doing this offshore is because
145.369	if you look at our coastal cities, there isn't a choice,
149.965	because we're going to use waste water, as I suggested,
152.764	and if you look at where most of the waste water
154.675	treatment plants are, they're embedded in the cities.
158.244	This is the city of San Francisco, which has 900 miles
161.927	of sewer pipes under the city already,
164.582	and it releases its waste water offshore.
168.558	So different cities around the world treat their waste water
172.47	differently. Some cities process it.
174.838	Some cities just release the water.
176.484	But in all cases, the water that's released is
179.142	perfectly adequate for growing microalgae.
182.102	So let's envision what the system might look like.
183.767	We call it OMEGA, which is an acronym for
185.869	Offshore Membrane Enclosures for Growing Algae.
190.3	At NASA, you have to have good acronyms.
192.852	So how does it work? I sort of showed you how it works already.
195.695	We put waste water and some source of CO2
199.415	into our floating structure,
202.462	and the waste water provides nutrients for the algae to grow,
206.103	and they sequester CO2 that would otherwise go off
208.821	into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas.
211.431	They of course use solar energy to grow,
213.759	and the wave energy on the surface provides energy
216.31	for mixing the algae, and the temperature
218.614	is controlled by the surrounding water temperature.
221.174	The algae that grow produce oxygen, as I've mentioned,
224.528	and they also produce biofuels and fertilizer and food and
227.816	other bi-algal products of interest.
231.257	And the system is contained. What do I mean by that?
234.674	It's modular. Let's say something happens that's
236.8	totally unexpected to one of the modules.
238.994	It leaks. It's struck by lightning.
241.193	The waste water that leaks out is water that already now
243.802	goes into that coastal environment, and
246.19	the algae that leak out are biodegradable,
248.438	and because they're living in waste water,
249.524	they're fresh water algae, which means they can't
252.593	live in salt water, so they die.
254.39	The plastic we'll build it out of is some kind of
256.55	well-known plastic that we have good experience with, and
259.182	we'll rebuild our modules to be able to reuse them again.
264.033	So we may be able to go beyond that when thinking about
267.605	this system that I'm showing you, and that is to say
270.082	we need to think in terms of the water, the fresh water,
272.916	which is also going to be an issue in the future,
275.282	and we're working on methods now
277.119	for recovering the waste water.
279.641	The other thing to consider is the structure itself.
282.433	It provides a surface for things in the ocean,
285.484	and this surface, which is covered by seaweeds
288.727	and other organisms in the ocean,
291.221	will become enhanced marine habitat
295.208	so it increases biodiversity.
296.871	And finally, because it's an offshore structure,
298.871	we can think in terms of how it might contribute
301.773	to an aquaculture activity offshore.
305.527	"So you're probably thinking, ""Gee, this sounds"
307.116	"like a good idea. What can we do to try to see if it's real?"""
311.687	Well, I set up laboratories in Santa Cruz
315.502	at the California Fish and Game facility,
318.664	and that facility allowed us to have big seawater tanks
321.713	to test some of these ideas.
323.436	We also set up experiments in San Francisco
326.058	at one of the three waste water treatment plants,
328.889	again a facility to test ideas.
331.385	And finally, we wanted to see where we could look at
334.689	what the impact of this structure would be
337.393	in the marine environment, and we set up a field site
341.05	at a place called Moss Landing Marine Lab
343.513	in Monterey Bay, where we worked in a harbor
345.873	to see what impact this would have on marine organisms.
350.719	The laboratory that we set up in Santa Cruz was our skunkworks.
353.809	It was a place where we were growing algae
356.707	and welding plastic and building tools
359.372	and making a lot of mistakes,
360.895	or, as Edison said, we were
362.826	finding the 10,000 ways that the system wouldn't work.
366.276	Now, we grew algae in waste water, and we built tools
370.522	that allowed us to get into the lives of algae
373.954	so that we could monitor the way they grow,
375.676	what makes them happy, how do we make sure that
378.378	we're going to have a culture that will survive and thrive.
382.28	So the most important feature that we needed to develop were these
385.369	so-called photobioreactors, or PBRs.
388.097	These were the structures that would be floating at the
389.44	surface made out of some inexpensive plastic material
392.865	that'll allow the algae to grow, and we had built lots and lots
395.522	of designs, most of which were horrible failures,
398.651	and when we finally got to a design that worked,
400.986	at about 30 gallons, we scaled it up
403.273	to 450 gallons in San Francisco.
406.889	So let me show you how the system works.
409.083	We basically take waste water with algae of our choice in it,
412.795	and we circulate it through this floating structure,
415.501	this tubular, flexible plastic structure,
418.233	and it circulates through this thing,
419.726	and there's sunlight of course, it's at the surface,
422.438	and the algae grow on the nutrients.
424.843	But this is a bit like putting your head in a plastic bag.
427.265	The algae are not going to suffocate because of CO2,
430.522	as we would.
431.361	They suffocate because they produce oxygen, and they
434.02	don't really suffocate, but the oxygen that they produce
436.196	is problematic, and they use up all the CO2.
439.3	So the next thing we had to figure out was how we could
441.732	remove the oxygen, which we did by building this column
444.961	which circulated some of the water,
446.438	and put back CO2, which we did by bubbling the system
449.808	before we recirculated the water.
452.26	And what you see here is the prototype,
453.964	which was the first attempt at building this type of column.
457.762	The larger column that we then installed in San Francisco
460.202	in the installed system.
461.83	So the column actually had another very nice feature,
465.228	and that is the algae settle in the column,
468.345	and this allowed us to accumulate the algal biomass
471.919	in a context where we could easily harvest it.
474.886	So we would remove the algaes that concentrated
477.661	in the bottom of this column, and then we could
480.229	harvest that by a procedure where you float the algae
484.052	to the surface and can skim it off with a net.
487.948	So we wanted to also investigate what would be the impact
491.585	of this system in the marine environment,
494.516	and I mentioned we set up this experiment at a field site
497.996	in Moss Landing Marine Lab.
500.236	Well, we found of course that this material became
503.076	overgrown with algae, and we needed then to develop
505.988	a cleaning procedure, and we also looked at how
508.396	seabirds and marine mammals interacted, and in fact you
511.333	see here a sea otter that found this incredibly interesting,
514.356	and would periodically work its way across this little
517.46	floating water bed, and we wanted to hire this guy
520.348	or train him to be able to clean the surface
522.437	of these things, but that's for the future.
524.844	Now really what we were doing,
526.165	we were working in four areas.
527.937	Our research covered the biology of the system,
530.82	which included studying the way algae grew,
532.988	but also what eats the algae, and what kills the algae.
536.637	We did engineering to understand what we would need
538.816	to be able to do to build this structure,
541.109	not only on the small scale, but how we would build it
543.812	on this enormous scale that will ultimately be required.
547.128	I mentioned we looked at birds and marine mammals
550.328	and looked at basically the environmental impact
552.857	of the system, and finally we looked at the economics,
556.008	and what I mean by economics is,
557.655	what is the energy required to run the system?
560.76	Do you get more energy out of the system
562.182	than you have to put into the system
563.763	to be able to make the system run?
565.776	And what about operating costs?
567.522	And what about capital costs?
569.58	And what about, just, the whole economic structure?
573.738	So let me tell you that it's not going to be easy,
576.456	and there's lots more work to do in all four
579.016	of those areas to be able to really make the system work.
582.608	But we don't have a lot of time, and I'd like to show you
585.528	the artist's conception of how this system might look
589.03	if we find ourselves in a protected bay
591.71	somewhere in the world, and we have in the background
594.894	in this image, the waste water treatment plant
597.662	and a source of flue gas for the CO2,
600.535	but when you do the economics of this system,
603.27	you find that in fact it will be difficult to make it work.
606.342	Unless you look at the system as a way to treat waste water,
610.912	sequester carbon, and potentially for photovoltaic panels
614.64	or wave energy or even wind energy,
618.12	and if you start thinking in terms of
619.391	integrating all of these different activities,
622.432	you could also include in such a facility aquaculture.
627.079	So we would have under this system a shellfish aquaculture
630.007	where we're growing mussels or scallops.
632.101	We'd be growing oysters and things
635.093	that would be producing high value products and food,
637.931	and this would be a market driver as we build the system
640.701	to larger and larger scales so that it becomes, ultimately,
644.015	competitive with the idea of doing it for fuels.
649.816	So there's always a big question that comes up,
652.513	because plastic in the ocean has got a really bad reputation
655.857	right now, and so we've been thinking cradle to cradle.
658.846	What are we going to do with all this plastic that we're
661.563	going to need to use in our marine environment?
664.304	Well, I don't know if you know about this,
665.822	but in California, there's a huge amount of plastic
668.584	that's used in fields right now as plastic mulch,
671.929	and this is plastic that's making these tiny little greenhouses
675.153	right along the surface of the soil, and this provides
677.904	warming the soil to increase the growing season,
681.162	it allows us to control weeds,
683.705	and, of course, it makes the watering much more efficient.
687.297	So the OMEGA system will be part
689.61	of this type of an outcome, and that when we're finished
692.689	using it in the marine environment, we'll be using it,
695.378	hopefully, on fields.
697.931	Where are we going to put this,
699.251	and what will it look like offshore?
701.762	Here's an image of what we could do in San Francisco Bay.
704.753	San Francisco produces 65 million gallons a day
707.433	of waste water. If we imagine a five-day retention time
710.193	for this system, we'd need 325 million gallons
712.562	to accomodate, and that would be about 1,280 acres
716.588	of these OMEGA modules floating in San Francisco Bay.
720.207	Well, that's less than one percent
722.001	of the surface area of the bay.
723.752	It would produce, at 2,000 gallons per acre per year,
727.494	it would produce over 2 million gallons of fuel,
730.49	which is about 20 percent of the biodiesel,
732.69	or of the diesel that would be required in San Francisco,
735.698	and that's without doing anything about efficiency.
738.888	Where else could we potentially put this system?
741.858	There's lots of possibilities.
744.758	There's, of course, San Francisco Bay, as I mentioned.
746.81	San Diego Bay is another example,
748.626	Mobile Bay or Chesapeake Bay, but the reality is,
751.539	as sea level rises, there's going to be lots and lots
753.631	of new opportunities to consider. (Laughter)
757.538	So what I'm telling you about is a system
761.106	of integrated activities.
764.738	Biofuels production is integrated with alternative energy
767.348	is integrated with aquaculture.
770.15	I set out to find a pathway
774.074	to innovative production of sustainable biofuels,
779.72	and en route I discovered that what's really required
782.968	for sustainability is integration more than innovation.
790.245	Long term, I have great faith
793.675	in our collective and connected ingenuity.
798.82	I think there is almost no limit to what we can accomplish
803.136	if we are radically open
805.338	and we don't care who gets the credit.
809.068	Sustainable solutions for our future problems
813.284	are going to be diverse
815.684	and are going to be many.
818.149	I think we need to consider everything,
820.94	everything from alpha to OMEGA.
823.972	Thank you. (Applause)
826.852	(Applause)
832.607	Chris Anderson: Just a quick question for you, Jonathan.
835.819	Can this project continue to move forward within
838.027	NASA or do you need some very ambitious
841.992	green energy fund to come and take it by the throat?
846.068	Jonathan Trent: So it's really gotten to a stage now
847.371	in NASA where they would like to spin it out into something
850.385	which would go offshore, and there are a lot of issues
852.776	with doing it in the United States because of limited
855.003	permitting issues and the time required to get permits
857.497	to do things offshore.
859.011	It really requires, at this point, people on the outside,
861.809	and we're being radically open with this technology
864.113	in which we're going to launch it out there
865.825	for anybody and everybody who's interested
868.101	to take it on and try to make it real.
869.941	CA: So that's interesting. You're not patenting it.
872.418	You're publishing it.
874.093	JT: Absolutely.
874.856	CA: All right. Thank you so much.
876.747	JT: Thank you. (Applause)
