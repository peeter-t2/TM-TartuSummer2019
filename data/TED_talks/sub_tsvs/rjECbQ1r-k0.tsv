16.26	I want to talk to you about something
18.363	kind of big.
21.942	We'll start here.
24.837	Sixty-five million years ago --
26.81	(Laughter)
27.871	the dinosaurs had a bad day.
30.934	(Laughter)
33.569	A chunk of rock six miles across,
36.868	moving something like 50 times
36.868	the speed of a rifle bullet,
40.633	slammed into the Earth.
42.438	It released its energy all at once,
44.918	and it was an explosion
44.918	that was mind-numbing.
48.47	If you took every
48.47	nuclear weapon ever built
51.355	at the height of the Cold War,
52.938	lumped them together,
54.334	and blew them up at the same time,
56.86	that would be one one-millionth
56.86	of the energy released at that moment.
62.256	The dinosaurs had a really bad day.
65.77	OK?
66.959	Now, a six-mile-wide rock is very large.
69.324	We all live here in Boulder.
70.713	If you look out your window
70.713	and see Longs Peak --
73.137	you're probably familiar with it --
74.876	now, scoop up Longs Peak
74.876	and put it out in space.
77.913	Take ... Meeker, Mt. Meeker.
80.622	Lump that in there,
80.622	and put that in space as well.
83.383	And Mt. Everest. And K2.
86.435	And the Indian peaks.
88.022	Then you're starting to get an idea
88.022	of how much rock we're talking about, OK?
91.91	We know it was that big
93.111	because of the impact it had
93.111	and the crater it left.
95.971	It hit in what we now know
95.971	as Yucatan, the Gulf of Mexico.
99.96	You can see here,
99.96	there's the Yucatan Peninsula,
102.594	if you recognize Cozumel
102.594	off the east coast there.
104.991	Here is how big of a crater was left.
107.731	It was huge.
108.928	To give you a sense
108.928	of the scale ... there you go.
111.54	The scale here is 50 miles on top,
111.54	a hundred kilometers on the bottom.
115.557	This thing was 300 kilometers
115.557	across -- 200 miles --
118.633	an enormous crater that excavated
118.633	out vast amounts of earth
122.234	that splashed around the globe
122.234	and set fires all over the planet,
126.829	threw up enough dust to block out the sun.
129.098	It wiped out 75 percent
129.098	of all species on Earth.
133.468	Now, not all asteroids are that big.
136.38	Some of them are smaller.
138.61	Here is one that came in
141.493	over the United States in October of 1992.
145.872	It came in on a Friday night.
147.632	Why is that important?
148.912	Because back then, video cameras
148.912	were just starting to become popular,
152.708	and parents would bring them
152.708	to their kids' football games
156.684	to film their kids playing football.
158.531	And since this came in on a Friday,
160.682	they were able to get this great footage
160.682	of this thing breaking up
164.147	as it came in over West Virginia,
164.147	Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey
167.626	until it did that
168.96	to a car in New York.
170.414	(Laughter)
172.014	Now, this is not a 200-mile-wide crater,
175.536	but then again, you can see the rock,
175.536	which is sitting right here,
179.041	about the size of a football,
180.459	that hit that car and did that damage.
182.865	Now, this thing was probably
182.865	about the size of a school bus
185.7	when it first came in.
186.881	It broke up through atmospheric pressure,
188.882	it crumbled, and then
188.882	the pieces fell apart
191.005	and did some damage.
192.513	Now, you wouldn't want that falling
192.513	on your foot or your head,
196.463	because it would do that to it.
197.983	That would be bad.
199.96	But it won't wipe out, you know,
199.96	all life on Earth, so that's fine.
203.248	But it turns out, you don't need
203.248	something six miles across
206.96	to do a lot of damage.
208.227	There is a median point
208.227	between tiny rock and gigantic rock,
211.946	and in fact, if any of you
211.946	have ever been to near Winslow, Arizona,
215.838	there is a crater in the desert
215.838	there that is so iconic
219.381	that it is actually
219.381	"called ""Meteor Crater."""
221.965	To give you a sense of scale,
221.965	this is about a mile wide.
224.966	If you look up at the top,
224.966	that's a parking lot,
228.229	and those are recreational
228.229	vehicles right there.
231.147	So it's about a mile across,
234.245	The object that formed this
234.245	was probably about 30 to 50 yards across,
239.694	so roughly the size
239.694	of Macky Auditorium here.
243.412	It came in at speeds that were tremendous,
246.015	slammed into the ground, blew up,
248.363	and exploded with the energy of roughly
248.363	a 20-megaton nuclear bomb --
252.18	a very hefty bomb.
253.771	This was 50,000 years ago,
255.905	so it may have wiped out
255.905	a few buffalo or antelope,
258.799	or something like that out in the desert,
261.381	but it probably would not have caused
261.381	global devastation.
265.206	It turns out that these things
265.206	don't have to hit the ground
268.853	to do a lot of damage.
270.46	Now, in 1908, over Siberia,
270.46	near the Tunguska region --
274.341	for those of you who are Dan Aykroyd fans
274.341	"and saw ""Ghostbusters,"""
277.546	when he talked about the greatest
277.546	cross-dimensional rift
280.206	since the Siberia blast of 1909,
282.164	where he got the date
282.164	wrong, but that's OK.
284.797	(Laughter)
285.933	It was 1908. That's fine.
285.933	I can live with that.
288.224	(Laughter)
290.081	Another rock came
290.081	into the Earth's atmosphere
293.18	and this one blew up above the ground,
295.396	several miles up
295.396	above the surface of the Earth.
297.733	The heat from the explosion
297.733	set fire to the forest below it,
302.933	and then the shock wave came down
302.933	and knocked down trees
306.134	for hundreds of square miles.
308.976	This did a huge amount of damage.
310.977	And again, this was a rock
310.977	probably roughly the size
313.746	of this auditorium that we're sitting in.
315.848	In Meteor Crater, it was made of metal,
317.849	and metal is much tougher,
317.849	so it made it to the ground.
320.517	The one over Tunguska
320.517	was probably made of rock,
322.848	and that's much more crumbly,
322.848	so it blew up in the air.
325.666	Either way, these are tremendous
325.666	explosions -- 20 megatons.
330.375	Now, when these things blow up,
332.448	they're not going to do
332.448	global ecological damage.
335.859	They're not going to do
335.859	something like the dinosaur killer did.
339.051	They're just not big enough.
340.544	But they will do global economic damage,
343.254	because they don't have
343.254	to hit, necessarily,
345.796	to do this kind of damage.
347.329	They don't have to do global devastation.
349.96	If one of these things were to hit
349.96	pretty much anywhere,
352.796	it would cause a panic.
353.975	But if it came over a city,
353.975	an important city --
356.264	not that any city
356.264	is more important than others,
358.552	but some of them we depend on more
358.552	on the global economic basis --
361.915	that could do a huge amount of damage
361.915	to us as a civilization.
367.145	So, now that I've scared
367.145	the crap out of you --
370.691	(Laughter)
371.82	what can we do about this?
373.821	This is a potential threat.
375.932	Let me note that we have not had
375.932	a giant impact like the dinosaur killer
380.342	for 65 million years.
381.653	They're very rare.
383.014	The smaller ones happen more often,
385.157	but probably on the order of a millennium,
387.708	every few centuries
387.708	or every few thousand years.
391.108	But it's still something to be aware of.
393.184	Well, what do we do about them?
394.748	The first thing
394.748	we have to do is find them.
396.879	This is an image of an asteroid
396.879	that passed us in 2009.
401.145	It's right here.
402.966	But you can see that it's extremely faint.
405.461	I don't know if you can see that
405.461	in the back row.
407.818	These are just stars.
409.257	This is a rock
409.257	that was about 30 yards across,
411.514	so roughly the size of the ones
411.514	that blew up over Tunguska
414.417	and hit Arizona 50,000 years ago.
416.667	These things are faint.
417.853	They're hard to see,
417.853	and the sky is really big.
420.303	We have to find these things first.
422.247	Well, the good news is,
422.247	we're looking for them.
424.55	NASA has devoted money to this;
426.867	the National Science Foundation
426.867	and other countries
429.292	are interested in doing this.
430.731	We're building telescopes
430.731	that are looking for the threat.
433.508	That's a great first step.
433.508	But what's the second step?
436.098	The second step is if we see one heading
436.098	toward us, we have to stop it.
439.57	What do we do?
440.745	You've probably heard
440.745	about the asteroid Apophis.
443.121	If you haven't yet, you will.
445.285	If you've heard about the Mayan
447.974	you're going to hear about Apophis,
449.69	because you're keyed in
449.69	to all the doomsday networks, anyway.
453.007	(Laughter)
454.739	Apophis is an asteroid
454.739	that was discovered in 2004.
457.785	It's roughly 250 [meters] across,
457.785	so it's pretty big --
461.541	bigger than a football stadium.
463.874	And it's going to pass
463.874	by the Earth in April of 2029.
467.394	And it's going to pass us so close
469.139	that it's actually going to come
469.139	underneath our weather satellites.
472.878	The Earth's gravity is going to bend
472.878	the orbit of this thing so much
476.601	that if it's just right,
478.027	if it passes through this region of space,
480.512	this kidney-bean-shaped region
480.512	called the keyhole,
483.993	the Earth's gravity will bend it
483.993	just enough that seven years later,
487.517	on April 13 -- which is a Friday,
487.517	I'll note -- in the year 2036 --
491.538	(Laughter)
492.585	you can't plan that kind of stuff --
494.349	(Laughter)
495.435	Apophis is going to hit us.
496.937	And it's 250 meters across,
496.937	so it would do unbelievable damage.
501.32	The good news is that the odds of it
501.32	actually passing through this keyhole
504.941	and hitting us next go-around
504.941	are one in a million, roughly --
507.936	very, very low odds.
509.111	So I personally am not lying awake
509.111	at night worrying about this at all.
512.541	I don't think Apophis is a problem.
514.259	In fact, Apophis
514.259	is a blessing in disguise,
516.551	because it woke us up
516.551	to the dangers of these things.
519.16	This thing was discovered
519.16	just a few years ago
521.361	and could hit us a few years from now.
523.228	It won't, but it gives us a chance
523.228	to study these kinds of asteroids.
526.866	We didn't really necessarily understand
526.866	these keyholes, and now we do,
530.396	and it turns out that's really important,
532.564	because how do you stop
532.564	an asteroid like this?
535.066	Well, let me ask you:
536.612	What happens if you're standing
536.612	in the road and a car's headed for you?
540.058	What do you do?
541.252	You do this. Right?
541.252	Move, and the car goes past you.
543.73	But we can't move the Earth,
543.73	at least not easily,
546.074	but we can move a small asteroid.
547.812	And it turns out, we've even done it.
550.031	In the year 2005, NASA launched
550.031	a probe called Deep Impact,
554.016	which slammed a piece of itself
554.016	into the nucleus of a comet.
558.501	Comets are very much like asteroids.
560.394	The purpose wasn't to push it
560.394	out of the way;
562.537	the purpose was to make a crater
562.537	to excavate the material
565.696	and see what was underneath
565.696	the surface of this comet,
568.275	which we learned quite a bit about.
569.995	We did move the comet a little tiny bit --
572.298	not very much, but that wasn't the point.
574.299	However, think about this:
576.16	This thing is orbiting the Sun
576.16	at 10, 20 miles per second.
580.536	We shot a space probe
580.536	at it and hit it, OK?
583.259	Imagine how hard that must be,
583.259	and we did it.
585.914	That means we can do it again.
587.741	If we see an asteroid that's coming
587.741	toward us, headed right for us,
591.904	and we have two years to go?
593.61	Boom! We hit it.
594.98	You know, if you watch the movies --
597.527	(Laughter)
598.609	you might think:
599.785	Why don't we use a nuclear weapon?
601.446	Well, you can try that,
601.446	but the problem is timing.
603.823	Shoot a nuclear weapon at this thing,
605.637	you have to blow it up
605.637	within a few milliseconds of tolerance,
608.593	or else you'll miss it.
609.793	And there are a lot of other problems
609.793	with that; it's very hard to do.
613.118	But just hitting something?
613.118	That's pretty easy.
615.345	I think even NASA can do that,
615.345	and proved that they can.
618.007	(Laughter)
619.04	The problem is, if you hit this asteroid,
619.04	you've changed the orbit,
622.493	you measure the orbit,
623.669	then you find out, oh yeah,
623.669	we just pushed it into a keyhole,
626.62	and now it's going to hit us
626.62	in three years.
628.721	Well, my opinion is: fine!
630.873	It's not hitting us in six months --
632.766	that's good.
633.952	Now we have three years
633.952	to do something else.
636.744	And you can hit it again.
638.136	That's kind of ham-fisted;
639.47	you might just push it
639.47	into a third keyhole or whatever,
642.163	so you don't do that.
643.36	And this is the part --
645.026	it's the part I just love.
646.35	(Laughter)
648.989	"After the big macho ""Grr ... bam!"
648.989	"We're gonna hit this thing in the face,"""
653.471	then we bring in the velvet gloves.
656.293	(Laughter)
658.16	There's a group of scientists
658.16	and engineers and astronauts,
661.073	and they call themselves
661.073	The B612 Foundation.
663.53	For those of you who've read
663.53	"""The Little Prince,"""
665.9	you understand that reference, I hope --
667.892	the little prince lived
667.892	on an asteroid called B612.
670.371	These are smart guys -- men and women --
670.371	astronauts, like I said, engineers.
674.107	Rusty Schweickart, who was an Apollo 9
674.107	astronaut, is on this.
677.391	Dan Durda, my friend who made this image,
679.534	works here at Southwest Research Institute
679.534	in Boulder, on Walnut Street.
683.465	He created this image for this.
685.024	He's actually one of the astronomers
685.024	who works for them.
687.702	If we see an asteroid
687.702	that's going to hit the Earth
690.329	and we have enough time,
692.066	we can hit it to move it
692.066	into a better orbit.
694.445	But then what we do is launch a probe
694.445	that has to weigh a ton or two.
699.27	It doesn't have to be huge --
699.27	a couple of tons, not that big --
702.28	and you park it near the asteroid.
704.017	You don't land on it, because these things
704.017	are tumbling end over end.
707.372	It's very hard to land on them.
708.992	Instead you get near it.
710.178	The gravity of the asteroid
710.178	pulls on the probe,
712.426	and the probe
712.426	has a couple of tons of mass.
714.474	It has a little tiny bit of gravity,
716.231	but it's enough
716.231	that it can pull the asteroid,
719.484	and you have your rocket set up --
721.133	you can barely see it here,
721.133	but there's rocket plumes --
724.026	and these guys are connected
724.026	by their own gravity,
727.424	and if you move the probe
727.424	very slowly -- very, very gently,
730.996	you can very easily finesse that rock
730.996	into a safe orbit.
736.043	You can even put in orbit
736.043	around the Earth where we could mine it,
739.192	although that's a whole other thing;
739.192	I won't go into that.
742.01	(Laughter)
743.061	But we'd be rich!
744.837	(Laughter)
750.295	So think about this, right?
753.005	There are these giant rocks flying
753.005	out there, and they're hitting us,
756.317	and they're doing damage to us.
757.863	But we've figured out how to do this,
759.696	and all the pieces
759.696	are in place to do this.
761.937	We have astronomers
761.937	with telescopes, looking for them.
765.162	We have very, very smart people,
767.457	who are concerned about this
767.457	and figuring out how to fix the problem,
770.873	and we have the technology to do this.
772.729	This probe actually can't use
772.729	chemical rockets.
774.955	Chemical rockets provide
774.955	too much thrust, too much push.
777.637	The probe would just shoot away.
779.223	We invented something called an ion drive,
781.298	which is a very, very,
781.298	very low-thrust engine.
783.876	It generates the force a piece of paper
783.876	would have on your hand --
787.209	incredibly light, but it can run
787.209	for months and years,
791.197	providing that very gentle push.
793.551	If anybody here is a fan
793.551	"of the original ""Star Trek,"""
796.164	they ran across an alien ship
796.164	that had an ion drive,
798.983	"and Spock said, ""They're very"
798.983	technically sophisticated.
801.699	They're a hundred years
801.699	"ahead of us with this drive."""
804.224	Yeah, we have an ion drive now.
805.794	We don't have the Enterprise,
805.794	but we've got an ion drive now.
808.8	(Laughter)
810.77	(Applause)
812.91	Spock.
814.16	(Laughter)
816.316	So ...
819.048	That's the difference --
820.716	that's the difference
820.716	between us and the dinosaurs.
823.677	This happened to them.
825.898	It doesn't have to happen to us.
827.737	The difference
827.737	between the dinosaurs and us
830.919	is that we have a space program
833.058	and we can vote,
834.804	and so we can change our future.
837.16	(Laughter)
838.821	We have the ability to change our future.
840.937	Sixty-five million years from now,
842.938	we don't have to have our bones
842.938	collecting dust in a museum.
846.866	Thank you very much.
848.058	(Applause)
