15.26	I'm actually here
17.26	to make a challenge to people.
19.26	I know there have been many challenges made to people.
22.26	The one I'm going to make
24.26	is that it is time for us to reclaim
26.26	what peace really means.
29.26	"Peace is not ""Kumbaya, my Lord."""
32.26	Peace is not the dove and the rainbow --
35.26	as lovely as they are.
38.26	When I see the symbols
40.26	of the rainbow and the dove,
42.26	I think of personal serenity.
45.26	I think of meditation.
47.26	I do not think
49.26	about what I consider to be peace,
52.26	which is sustainable peace
55.26	with justice and equality.
58.26	It is a sustainable peace
60.26	in which the majority of people
63.26	on this planet
65.26	have access to enough resources
68.26	to live dignified lives,
71.26	where these people have enough access
74.26	to education
76.26	and health care,
78.26	so that they can live in freedom from want
81.26	and freedom from fear.
84.26	This is called human security.
87.26	And I am not a complete pacifist
90.26	like some of my really, really heavy-duty,
93.26	non-violent friends,
95.26	like Mairead McGuire.
97.26	I understand that humans
99.26	"are so ""messed up"" --"
102.26	to use a nice word,
104.26	because I promised my mom
106.26	I'd stop using the F-bomb in public.
108.26	And I'm trying harder and harder.
111.26	Mom, I'm really trying.
113.26	We need a little bit of police;
115.26	we need a little bit of military,
117.26	but for defense.
119.26	We need to redefine
121.26	what makes us secure
123.26	in this world.
125.26	It is not arming our country
127.26	to the teeth.
130.26	It is not getting other countries
132.26	to arm themselves to the teeth
134.26	with the weapons that we produce
136.26	and we sell them.
139.26	It is using that money more rationally
142.26	to make the countries of the world secure,
146.26	to make the people of the world secure.
150.26	I was thinking about
152.26	the recent ongoings
154.26	in Congress,
156.26	where the president is offering
159.26	8.4 billion dollars
162.26	to try to get the START vote.
164.26	I certainly support the START vote.
166.26	But he's offering 84 billion dollars
169.26	for the modernizing
172.26	of nuclear weapons.
174.26	Do you know the figure that the U.N. talks about
177.26	for fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals
180.26	is 80 billion dollars?
185.26	Just that little bit of money,
187.26	which to me, I wish it was in my bank account --
189.26	it's not, but ...
191.26	In global terms, it's a little bit of money.
196.26	But it's going to modernize weapons
198.26	we do not need
200.26	and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime,
203.26	unless we get up off our ...
205.26	and take action to make it happen,
208.26	unless we begin to believe
210.26	that all of the things that we've been hearing about
212.26	in these last two days
214.26	are elements of what come together
216.26	to make human security.
219.26	It is saving the tigers.
222.26	It is stopping the tar sands.
225.26	It is having access
228.26	to medical equipment
230.26	that can actually tell who does have cancer.
233.26	It is all of those things.
235.26	It is using our money for all of those things.
238.26	It is about action.
240.26	I was in Hiroshima
242.26	a couple of weeks ago,
244.26	and His Holiness --
246.26	we're sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city,
249.26	and there were about eight of us Nobel laureates.
251.26	And he's a bad guy. He's like a bad kid in church.
254.26	We're staring at everybody, waiting our turn to speak,
257.26	and he leans over to me, and he says,
259.26	"""Jody, I'm a Buddhist monk."""
263.26	"I said, ""Yes, Your Holiness."
266.26	"Your robe gives it away."""
268.26	(Laughter)
270.26	"He said, ""You know"
272.26	"that I kind of like meditation, and I pray."""
275.26	"I said, ""That's good. That's good."
277.26	We need that in the world.
279.26	"I don't follow that, but that's cool."""
282.26	"And he says, ""But I have become skeptical."
285.26	I do not believe
288.26	that meditation and prayer
291.26	will change this world.
293.26	I think what we need
295.26	"is action."""
297.26	His Holiness, in his robes,
299.26	is my new action hero.
302.26	I spoke with Aung Sun Suu Kyi
304.26	a couple of days ago.
306.26	As most of you know,
308.26	she's a hero for democracy in her country, Burma.
311.26	You probably also know
313.26	that she has spent 15 of the last 20 years
315.26	imprisoned for her efforts
318.26	to bring about democracy.
320.26	She was just released a couple of weeks ago,
323.26	and we're very concerned to see how long she will be free,
326.26	because she is already out in the streets in Rangoon,
328.26	agitating for change.
330.26	She is already out in the streets, working with the party
333.26	to try to rebuild it.
335.26	But I talked to her for a range of issues.
338.26	But one thing that I want to say,
340.26	because it's similar to what His Holiness said.
343.26	"She said, ""You know, we have a long road to go"
346.26	to finally get democracy in my country.
349.26	But I don't believe in hope
352.26	without endeavor.
355.26	I don't believe in the hope of change,
358.26	unless we take action
360.26	"to make it so."""
362.26	Here's another woman hero of mine.
365.26	She's my friend, Dr. Shirin Ebadi,
368.26	the first Muslim woman
370.26	to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
372.26	She has been in exile
374.26	for the last year and a half.
376.26	You ask her where she lives -- where does she live in exile?
379.26	She says the airports of the world.
382.26	She is traveling because she was out of the country
385.26	at the time of the elections.
387.26	And instead of going home,
389.26	she conferred with all the other women that she works with,
392.26	"who said to her, ""Stay out. We need you out."
395.26	We need to be able to talk to you out there,
397.26	so that you can give the message
399.26	"of what's happening here."""
401.26	A year and a half --
403.26	she's out speaking
405.26	on behalf of the other women in her country.
408.26	Wangari Maathai --
412.26	"They call her the ""Tree Lady,"""
414.26	but she's more than the Tree Lady.
416.26	Working for peace
418.26	is very creative.
420.26	It's hard work every day.
422.26	When she was planting those trees,
424.26	I don't think most people understand
426.26	that, at the same time,
429.26	she was using the action
431.26	of getting people together to plant those trees
434.26	to talk about how to overcome
437.26	the authoritarian government in her country.
440.26	People could not gather
442.26	without getting busted and taken to jail.
445.26	But if they were together planting trees for the environment,
448.26	it was okay --
450.26	creativity.
453.26	But it's not just iconic women
456.26	like Shirin,
458.26	like Aung Sun Suu Kyi, like Wangari Maathai --
461.26	it is other women in the world
464.26	who are also struggling together
466.26	to change this world.
468.26	The Women's League of Burma,
473.26	came together because there's strength in numbers.
476.26	Working together is what changes our world.
479.26	The Million Signatures Campaign
481.26	of women inside Burma
483.26	working together to change human rights,
486.26	to bring democracy to that country.
488.26	When one is arrested and taken to prison,
491.26	another one comes out and joins the movement,
494.26	recognizing that if they work together,
497.26	they will ultimately bring change
499.26	in their own country.
501.26	Mairead McGuire in the middle,
503.26	Betty Williams on the right-hand side --
505.26	bringing peace to Northern Ireland.
507.26	I'll tell you the quick story.
509.26	An IRA driver was shot,
511.26	and his car plowed into people
513.26	on the side of the street.
515.26	There was a mother and three children.
517.26	The children were killed on the spot.
519.26	It was Mairead's sister.
521.26	Instead of giving in
523.26	to grief, depression, defeat
526.26	in the face of that violence,
529.26	Mairead hooked up with Betty --
531.26	a staunch Protestant and a staunch Catholic --
534.26	and they took to the streets
536.26	"to say, ""No more violence."""
539.26	And they were able to get
541.26	tens of thousands of, primarily, women, some men,
544.26	in the streets to bring about change.
548.26	And they have been
550.26	part of what brought peace to Northern Ireland,
552.26	and they're still working on it,
554.26	because there's still a lot more to do.
557.26	This is Rigoberta Menchu Tum.
559.26	She also received the Peace Prize.
561.26	She is now running for president.
563.26	She is educating the indigenous people of her country
566.26	about what it means to be a democracy,
569.26	about how you bring democracy to the country,
572.26	about educating, about how to vote --
574.26	but that democracy is not just about voting;
577.26	it's about being an active citizen.
579.26	That's what I got stuck doing --
581.26	the landmine campaign.
583.26	One of the things that made this campaign work
586.26	is because we grew from two NGOs
589.26	to thousands
591.26	in 90 countries around the world,
593.26	working together in common cause to ban landmines.
597.26	Some of the people who worked in our campaign
599.26	could only work maybe an hour a month.
601.26	They could maybe volunteer that much.
603.26	There were others, like myself,
605.26	who were full-time.
607.26	But it was the actions, together, of all of us
610.26	that brought about that change.
612.26	In my view, what we need today
614.26	is people getting up
616.26	and taking action
618.26	to reclaim the meaning of peace.
620.26	It's not a dirty word.
622.26	It's hard work every single day.
624.26	And if each of us
626.26	who cares about the different things we care about
628.26	got up off our butts
630.26	and volunteered
632.26	as much time as we could,
635.26	we would change this world,
637.26	we would save this world.
639.26	And we can't wait for the other guy. We have to do it ourselves.
641.26	Thank you.
643.26	(Applause)
