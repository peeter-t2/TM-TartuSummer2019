16.917	Twelve years ago, I founded Zipcar.
20.679	Zipcar buys cars and parks them
23.525	throughout dense metropolitan areas
26.101	for people to use, by the hour and by the day,
29.229	instead of owning their own cars.
31.518	Each Zipcar replaces 15 personal cars,
35.402	and each driver drives about 80 percent less
38.506	because they're now paying the full cost,
40.866	all at once, in real time.
43.442	But what Zipcar really did was make sharing the norm.
47.687	Now, a decade later, it's really time to push the envelope a little bit,
51.938	and so a couple years ago I moved to Paris
53.923	with my husband and youngest child,
56.602	and we launched Buzzcar a year ago.
59.822	Buzzcar lets people rent out their own cars
63.079	to their friends and neighbors.
64.746	Instead of investing in a car, we invest in a community.
70.002	We bring the power of a corporation
72.329	to individuals who add their cars to the network.
75.442	Some people call this peer-to-peer.
79.13	This does express the humanity of what's going on,
82.418	and the personal relationships,
84.855	but that is also like saying that it's the same thing
87.551	as a yard sale or a bake sale or babysitting.
90.404	That's peer-to-peer.
91.629	It's like saying yard sales are the same thing as eBay,
96.516	or craft fairs are the same thing as Etsy.
104.088	But what's really happening is that we've got the power
106.45	of a free and open Internet,
108.655	and on top of that we're putting a platform for participation,
111.86	and the peers are now in partnership with the company,
115.547	creating shared value on shared values,
118.764	and each strengthening the other, and doing what the other can't do.
123.733	I call this Peers, Inc.
126.775	The incorporated side, the company,
129.336	is doing things that it does really well.
132.153	What does it do really well? It creates economies of scale,
135.922	significant and long-term resource investment,
139.665	the expertise of many different kinds of people
142.47	and different kinds of minds, and for individuals,
145.458	consumers, it's bringing the standards, rules and recourse
148.722	that we really want as consumers,
151.042	and this is kind of bound up in a brand promise,
153.985	and the companies are providing this on a platform for participation.
159.025	Peers are giving and doing things
161.362	that are incredibly expensive for companies to do.
164.369	What do they bring? They bring this fabulous diversity,
168.193	expensive for companies. And what does that deliver?
170.85	It delivers localization and customization,
173.611	specialization, and all of this aspect about social networks
177.018	and how companies are yearning and eager to get inside there?
179.866	It's natural for me. Me and my friends, I can connect to them easily.
183.962	And it also delivers really fabulous innovation,
187.525	and I'll talk about that later.
188.941	So we have the peers that are providing the services and the product,
192.357	and the company that's doing the stuff that companies do.
196.937	The two of these are delivering the best of both worlds.
201.301	Some of my favorite examples:
203.289	in transportation, Carpooling.com. Ten years old,
207.242	three and a half million people have joined up,
208.645	and a million rides are shared every day.
211.203	It's a phenomenal thing. It's the equivalent
214.435	of 2,500 TGV trains,
217.522	and just think, they didn't have to lay a track or buy a car.
221.498	This is all happening with excess capacity.
224.242	And it's not just with transportation, my love,
227.729	but of course in other realms. Here's Fiverr.com.
230.882	I met these founders just weeks after they had launched,
233.693	and now, in two years, what would you do for five dollars?
238.149	Seven hundred and fifty thousand gigs are now posted after two years,
242.417	what people would do for five dollars.
245.242	And not just easy things that anyone can do.
248.928	This Peers, Inc. concept is in a very difficult and complex realm.
253.704	TopCoder has 400,000 engineers who are delivering
257.9	complex design and engineering services.
261.7	When I talked to their CEO, he had this great line.
264.253	"He said, ""We have a community that owns its own company."""
269.043	And then my all-time favorite, Etsy.
271.315	Etsy is providing goods that people make themselves
274.586	and they're selling it in a marketplace.
276.252	It just celebrated its seventh anniversary,
279.667	and after seven years, last year it delivered
287.727	who have been making those objects.
290.883	I know you guys out there who are businesspeople,
293.642	"are thinking, ""Oh my God, I want to build one of those."
296.058	I see this incredible speed and scale.
297.735	You mean all I have to do is build a platform and all these people are going
300.244	"to put their stuff on top and I sit back and roll it in?"""
303.012	Building these platforms for participation are so nontrivial to do.
308.063	I think of the difference of Google Video versus YouTube.
312.076	Who would have thought that two young guys and a start-up
315.265	would beat out Google Video? Why?
317.448	I actually have no idea why. I didn't talk to them.
319.54	But I'm thinking, you know, they probably had
322.172	"the ""share"" button a little bit brighter and to the right,"
324.151	and so it was easier and more convenient for the two sides
327.145	that are always participating on these networks.
330.225	So I actually know a lot about building a peer platform now,
334.424	and a Peers, Inc. company, because I've spent
336.285	the last two years doing that in Paris.
339.684	So let me take you back how it's so incredibly different
343.105	building Buzzcar than it was building Zipcar,
345.98	because now every single thing we do has these two
348.26	different bodies that I have to be thinking about:
350.687	the owners who are going to provide the cars
353.551	and the drivers who are going to rent them.
355.998	Every single decision, I have to think about what is right for both sides.
359.47	There are many, many examples and I'll give you one
361.934	that is not my favorite example: insurance.
365.256	It took me a year and a half to get the insurance just right.
369.785	Hours and hours of sitting with insurers and many companies
372.774	and their thoughts about risk and how this is totally innovative,
376.52	they'd never thought of it before.
378.351	Way too much money, I just can't even go there, with lawyers,
381.718	trying to figure out how this is different, who's responsible to whom,
384.502	and the result was that we were able to provide owners
388.09	protection for their own driving records and their own history.
392.382	The cars are completely insured during the rental,
394.198	and it gives drivers what they need, and what do they need?
397.862	They need a low deductible,
400.367	and 24-hour roadside assistance.
402.615	So this was a trick to get these two sides.
405.499	So now I want to take you to the moment of --
409.747	When you're an entrepreneur, and you've started a new company,
413.715	there's the, here's all the stuff we do beforehand,
416.109	and then the service launches. What happens?
420.035	So all those months of work, they come into play.
424.435	Last June 1, we launched. It was an exciting moment.
428.633	And all the owners are adding their cars. It's really exciting.
432.243	All the drivers are becoming members. It's excellent.
434.669	The reservations start coming in, and here,
439.115	owners who were getting text messages and emails
442.182	"that said, ""Hey, Joe wants to rent your car for the weekend."
445.275	"You can earn 60 euros. Isn't that great? Yes or no?"""
449.679	No reply. Like, a huge proportion of them
453.176	couldn't be bothered after they had just started, they just signed up, to reply.
457.186	"So I thought, ""Duh, Robin, this is the difference between"
460.814	"industrial production and peer production."""
463.957	Industrial production, the whole point of industrial production
467.069	is to provide a standardized, exact service model
470.543	that is consistent every single time,
472.755	and I'm really thankful that my smartphone is made
475.756	using industrial production.
477.129	And Zipcar provides a very nice, consistent service
479.867	that works fabulously.
481.451	But what does peer production do? Peer production
484.593	is this completely different way of doing things,
487.886	and you have a big quality range, and so eBay, cleverly,
492.958	the first peer production, Peer, Inc. company, I'd say,
496.279	they figured out early on, we need to have ratings
500.877	and commentaries and all that yucky side stuff.
504.261	We can flag that and we can put it to the side, and people
507.509	who are buyers and consumers don't have to deal with it.
511.824	So going back, this is my look of excitement and joy,
516.882	because all this stuff that I'd also been hoping for
519.316	actually really did happen, and what's that?
521.343	That is the diversity of what's going on.
524.156	You have these different fabulous owners
526.788	and their different cars, different prices,
530.218	different locations. (Laughter)
532.356	They dress differently, and they look different,
537.503	and, really, I love these photos every time I look at them.
543.223	Cool guys, excited guys,
546.333	and here is Selma, who -- I love this driver.
551.112	And after a year, we have 1,000 cars
553.732	that are parked across France and 6,000 people
557.132	who are members and eager to drive them.
559.5	This would not be possible to do that in economic fashion
563.669	for a traditional company.
566.03	Back to this spectrum.
568.172	So what's happening is, we had the yuck side,
570.888	but we actually had this real wow side.
573.112	And I can tell you two great stories.
575.852	A driver was telling me that they went to rent a car
578.819	to go up the coast of France and the owner gave it to them,
582.554	"and said, ""You know what, here's where the cliffs are,"
584.546	and here's all the beaches, and this is my best beach,
587.066	"and this is where the best fish restaurant is."""
589.866	And the peers also become,
592.702	peers and owners create relationships,
594.963	and so at the last minute people can --
597.234	"a driver can say, ""Hey, you know what, I really need the car,"
599.891	"is it available?"" And that person will say,"
601.381	"""Sure, my wife's at home. Go pick up the keys. Go do it."""
604.492	So you can have these really nice things that can't happen,
607.891	"and it's a kind of ""Wow!"" and I want to say ""Wow!"""
611.723	type of thing that's happening here, because individuals,
614.203	if you're a company, what happens is you might have
618.824	or 100 people who are in charge of innovation.
620.782	What happens in Peer, Inc. companies is that you have
624.286	tens and hundreds and thousands and even millions
627.358	of people who are creating experiments on this model,
630.461	and so out of all that influence and that effort,
633.046	you are having this exceptional amount of innovation
637.437	that is coming out.
639.856	So one of the reasons, if we come back to why did I
643.224	call it Buzzcar? I wanted to remind all of us
646.065	about the power of the hive,
648.941	and its incredible facility to create this platform
651.877	that individuals want to participate and innovate on.
655.898	And for me, when I think about our future,
659.318	and all of those problems that seem incredibly large,
662.646	the scale is impossible, the urgency is there,
665.732	Peers, Inc. provides the speed and scale
668.766	and the innovation and the creativity that is going to answer these problems.
673.352	All we have to do is create a fabulous platform for participation -- nontrivial.
678.669	So I continue to think that
681.446	transportation is the center of the hard universe.
684.701	All problems come back to transportation for me.
687.025	But there are all these other areas that are these profound,
690.872	big problems that I know that we can work on,
694.237	and people are working on them in many different sectors,
697.013	but there's this really fabulous group of things
699.558	with the power of this Peers, Inc. model.
704.044	So over the last decade, we've been reveling in
710.529	the power of the Internet and how it's empowered individuals,
714.032	and for me, what Peers, Inc. does
716.628	is it takes it up a notch. We're now bringing the power
720.464	of the company and the corporation
723.46	and supercharging individuals.
726.325	So for me, it's a collaboration.
729.87	Together, we can. (Applause)
734.155	Thank you. (Applause)
