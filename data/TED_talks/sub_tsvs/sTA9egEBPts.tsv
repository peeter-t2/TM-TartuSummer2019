18.513	(Video) Newscaster: There's a large path
18.513	of destruction here in town.
21.855	... pulling trees from the ground,
21.855	shattering windows,
24.797	taking the roofs off of homes ...
27.637	Caitria O'Neill: That was me
29.696	in front of our house in Monson,
29.696	Massachusetts last June.
33.077	After an EF3 tornado ripped
33.077	straight through our town
36.442	and took parts of our roof off,
37.945	I decided to stay in Massachusetts,
40.014	instead of pursuing the master's program
41.943	I had moved my boxes
41.943	home that afternoon for.
45.166	Morgan O'Neill: So, on June 1,
45.166	we weren't disaster experts,
48.021	but on June 3, we started faking it.
50.119	This experience changed our lives,
52.149	and now we're trying
52.149	to change the experience.
54.61	CO: So, tornadoes
54.61	don't happen in Massachusetts,
57.079	and I was cleverly standing in the front
57.079	yard when one came over the hill.
60.604	After a lamppost flew by, my family
60.604	and I sprinted into the basement.
63.928	Trees were thrown against the house,
63.928	the windows exploded.
66.848	When we finally got out the back door,
68.741	transformers were burning in the street.
71.035	MO: I was here in Boston.
72.496	I'm a PhD student at MIT,
74.237	and I happen to study atmospheric science.
76.943	Actually, it gets weirder --
78.315	I was in the museum of science
78.315	at the time the tornado hit,
81.633	playing with the tornado display --
83.488	(Laughter)
84.69	so I missed her call.
85.865	I get a call from Caitria, hear the news,
85.865	and start tracking the radar online
89.633	to call the family back when another
89.633	supercell was forming in their area.
93.087	I drove home late that night
93.087	with batteries and ice.
95.552	We live across the street
95.552	from a historic church
97.889	that had lost its very
97.889	iconic steeple in the storm.
100.578	It had become a community
100.578	gathering place overnight.
103.067	The town hall and the police department
103.067	had also suffered direct hits,
106.395	and so people wanting to help
106.395	or needing information went to the church.
110.049	CO: We walked to the church because
110.049	we heard they had hot meals,
113.108	but when we arrived, we found problems.
115.004	There were a couple large,
115.004	sweaty men with chainsaws
117.473	standing in the center of the church,
117.473	but nobody knew where to send them
120.907	because no one knew the extent
120.907	of the damage yet.
123.23	As we watched, they became
123.23	frustrated and left
125.405	to go find somebody to help on their own.
127.384	MO: So we started organizing.
127.384	Why? It had to be done.
130.067	We found Pastor Bob and offered to give
130.067	the response some infrastructure.
133.534	And then, armed with just
133.534	two laptops and one air card,
136.73	we built a recovery machine.
140.748	(Applause)
143.366	CO: That was a tornado, and everyone's
143.366	heading to the church
146.398	to drop things off and volunteer.
148.088	MO: Everyone's donating clothing.
149.692	We should inventory
149.692	the donations piling up here.
152.11	CO: And we need a hotline.
152.11	Can you make a Google Voice number?
155.071	MO: Sure. And we need to tell people
155.071	what not to bring.
157.677	I'll make a Facebook account.
157.677	Can you print flyers?
160.114	CO: Yeah, but we don't even know
160.114	what houses are accepting help.
163.194	We need to canvas and send out volunteers.
165.223	MO: We need to tell people
165.223	what not to bring.
167.36	Hey, there's a news truck. I'll tell them.
169.388	CO: You got my number off the news?
169.388	We don't need more freezers!
172.436	(Together) MO: Insurance won't cover it?
172.436	CO: Juice boxes coming in an hour?
176.464	Together: Someone get me Post-its!
178.112	(Laughter)
179.137	CO: And then the rest of the community
179.137	figured out that we had answers.
182.838	MO: I can donate three water heaters,
182.838	but someone needs to come pick them up.
186.503	CO: My car is in my living room!
188.074	MO: My boyscout troop
188.074	would like to rebuild 12 mailboxes.
190.923	CO: My puppy is missing and insurance
190.923	doesn't cover chimneys.
193.817	MO: My church group of 50
193.817	would like housing and meals for a week
196.904	while we repair properties.
198.258	CO: You sent me to that place
198.258	on Washington Street yesterday,
201.195	and now I'm covered in poison ivy.
202.873	(Laughter)
203.996	So this is what filled our days.
205.786	We had to learn
205.786	how to answer questions quickly
208.024	and to solve problems in a minute or less;
210.298	otherwise, something
210.298	more urgent would come up,
212.522	and it wouldn't get done.
213.88	MO: We didn't get our authority
213.88	from the board of selectmen
216.711	or the emergency management
216.711	director or the United Way.
219.591	We just started answering questions
219.591	and making decisions
222.241	because someone -- anyone -- had to.
224.9	And why not me? I'm a campaign organizer.
227.279	I'm good at Facebook.
228.471	And there's two of me.
229.773	(Laughter)
231.343	CO: The point is, if there's a flood
231.343	or a fire or a hurricane,
234.895	you, or somebody like you,
236.68	are going to step up
236.68	and start organizing things.
239.315	The other point is that it is hard.
241.616	MO: Lying on the ground
241.616	after another 17-hour day,
244.331	Caitria and I would empty our pockets
246.162	and try to place dozens of scraps
246.162	of paper into context --
248.95	all bits of information
248.95	that had to be remembered and matched
251.84	in order to help someone.
253.092	After another day
253.092	and a shower at the shelter,
255.275	we realized it shouldn't be this hard.
257.472	CO: In a country like ours
257.472	where we breathe Wi-Fi,
260.341	leveraging technology for a faster
260.341	recovery should be a no-brainer.
263.896	Systems like the ones
263.896	that we were creating on the fly
266.464	could exist ahead of time.
267.781	And if some community member
267.781	is in this organizing position
271.334	in every area after every disaster,
273.904	these tools should exist.
276.309	MO: So, we decided to build them:
278.24	a recovery in a box, something that
278.24	could be deployed after every disaster
281.774	by any local organizer.
283.697	CO: I decided to stay in the country,
283.697	give up the master's in Moscow
287.104	and to work full-time to make this happen.
289.192	In the course of the past year,
290.709	we've become experts in the field
290.709	of community-powered disaster recovery.
294.193	And there are three main problems
294.193	that we've observed
296.701	with the way things work currently.
298.756	MO: The tools.
299.931	Large aid organizations are exceptional
299.931	at bringing massive resources to bear
303.89	after a disaster,
305.077	but they often fulfill very specific
305.077	missions, and then they leave.
308.516	This leaves local residents to deal with
308.516	the thousands of spontaneous volunteers,
312.758	thousands of donations,
313.941	and all with no training and no tools.
315.972	So they use Post-its or Excel or Facebook.
319.124	But none of these tools allow you
319.124	to value high-priority information
322.362	amidst all of the photos and well-wishes.
324.855	CO: The timing.
326.189	Disaster relief is essentially
326.189	a backwards political campaign.
329.381	In a political campaign,
329.381	you start with no interest
332.127	and no capacity to turn that into action.
334.333	You build both gradually,
335.568	until a moment of peak mobilization
335.568	at the time of the election.
338.743	In a disaster, however,
338.743	you start with all of the interest
341.502	and none of the capacity.
342.842	And you've only got about seven days
344.938	to capture 50 percent of all
344.938	of the Web searches that will ever be made
348.401	to help your area.
349.84	Then some sporting event happens,
351.451	and you've got only the resources
351.451	that you've collected thus far
354.491	to meet the next five years
354.491	of recovery needs.
357.381	This is the slide for Katrina.
360.307	This is the curve for Joplin.
362.77	And this is the curve
362.77	for the Dallas tornadoes in April,
365.577	where we deployed software.
367.255	There's a gap here.
368.953	Affected households have to wait
368.953	for the insurance adjuster to visit
372.186	before they can start accepting help
372.186	on their properties.
374.948	And you've only got about four days
374.948	of interest in Dallas.
379.089	MO: Data.
380.444	Data is inherently unsexy,
382.302	but it can jump-start an area's recovery.
384.548	FEMA and the state will pay
387.589	of a federally-declared disaster,
389.208	leaving the town to pay
389.208	the last 15 percent of the bill.
391.873	Now that expense can be huge,
393.506	but if the town can mobilize X amount
393.506	of volunteers for Y hours,
397.484	the dollar value of that labor used
397.484	goes toward the town's contribution.
402.349	But who knows that?
404.042	Now try to imagine
404.042	the sinking feeling you get
406.288	when you've just sent out 2,000 volunteers
406.288	and you can't prove it.
410.882	CO: These are three problems
410.882	with a common solution.
413.343	If we can get the right tools
413.343	at the right time
416.396	to the people who will inevitably step up
418.386	and start putting
418.386	their communities back together,
420.765	we can create new standards
420.765	in disaster recovery.
423.491	MO: We needed canvasing tools,
423.491	donations databasing,
426.449	needs reporting, remote volunteer access,
429.463	all in an easy-to-use website.
431.334	CO: And we needed help.
432.795	Alvin, our software engineer
432.795	and co-founder, has built these tools.
435.983	Chris and Bill have volunteered their time
435.983	to use operations and partnerships.
440.078	And we've been flying into disaster areas
440.078	since this past January,
443.594	setting up software, training residents
445.967	and licensing the software to areas
445.967	that are preparing for disasters.
450.229	MO: One of our first launches
450.229	was after the Dallas tornadoes
453.079	this past April.
454.254	We flew into a town
454.254	that had a static, outdated website
456.908	and a frenetic Facebook feed,
456.908	trying to structure the response,
459.898	and we launched our platform.
461.31	All of the interest came
461.31	in the first four days,
463.576	but by the time they lost the news cycle,
465.57	that's when the needs came in,
467.031	yet they had this massive resource
467.031	of what people were able to give
470.225	and they've been able to meet
470.225	the needs of their residents.
473.013	CO: So it's working,
473.013	but it could be better.
475.093	Emergency preparedness is a big deal
475.093	in disaster recovery
477.795	because it makes towns safer
477.795	and more resilient.
480.068	Imagine if we could have
480.068	these systems ready to go in a place
482.983	before a disaster.
485.232	So that's what we're working on.
487.064	We're working on getting the software
487.064	to places so people expect it,
490.297	so people know how to use it
491.662	and so it can be filled ahead of time
493.468	with that micro-information
493.468	that drives recovery.
495.874	MO: It's not rocket science.
497.731	These tools are obvious
497.731	and people want them.
499.974	In our hometown,
499.974	we trained a half-dozen residents
502.426	to run these Web tools on their own,
504.172	because Caitria and I
504.172	live here, in Boston.
506.384	They took to it immediately,
506.384	and now they are forces of nature.
509.384	There are over three volunteer groups
509.384	working almost every day,
512.363	and have been since June 1 of last year,
514.395	to make sure these residents get what
514.395	they need and get back in their homes.
518.002	They have hotlines
518.002	and spreadsheets and data.
520.349	CO: And that makes a difference.
522.463	June 1 this year marked the one-year
522.463	anniversary of the Monson tornado,
526.341	and our community's never been
526.341	more connected or more empowered.
529.658	We've been able to see the same
529.658	transformation in Texas and in Alabama.
533.914	Because it doesn't take Harvard or MIT
535.761	to fly in and fix problems
535.761	after a disaster;
537.85	it takes a local.
539.198	No matter how good an aid organization
539.198	is at what they do,
542.077	they eventually have to go home.
543.776	But if you give locals the tools,
546.014	if you show them
546.014	what they can do to recover,
548.843	they become experts.
552.267	(Applause)
553.315	MO: All right. Let's go.
554.491	(Applause)
