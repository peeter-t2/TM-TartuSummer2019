15.26	Pat Mitchell: What is the story of this pin?
17.26	"Madeleine Albright: This is ""Breaking the Glass Ceiling."""
19.26	PM: Oh.
22.26	That was well chosen, I would say, for TEDWomen.
25.26	MA: Most of the time I spend when I get up in the morning
27.26	is trying to figure out what is going to happen.
29.26	And none of this pin stuff would have happened
31.26	if it hadn't been for Saddam Hussein.
33.26	I'll tell you what happened.
35.26	I went to the United Nations as an ambassador,
38.26	and it was after the Gulf War,
40.26	and I was an instructed ambassador.
42.26	And the cease-fire had been translated
44.26	into a series of sanctions resolutions,
47.26	and my instructions
49.26	were to say perfectly terrible things about Saddam Hussein constantly,
52.26	which he deserved -- he had invaded another country.
55.26	And so all of a sudden, a poem appeared in the papers in Baghdad
58.26	comparing me to many things,
60.26	"but among them an ""unparalleled serpent."""
63.26	And so I happened to have a snake pin.
65.26	So I wore it when we talked about Iraq.
67.26	(Laughter)
69.26	And when I went out to meet the press,
71.26	"they zeroed in, said, ""Why are you wearing that snake pin?"""
73.26	"I said, ""Because Saddam Hussein compared me to an unparalleled serpent."""
76.26	And then I thought, well this is fun.
78.26	So I went out and I bought a lot of pins
81.26	that would, in fact, reflect
83.26	what I thought we were going to do on any given day.
85.26	So that's how it all started.
87.26	PM: So how large is the collection?
89.26	MA: Pretty big.
91.26	It's now traveling.
93.26	At the moment it's in Indianapolis,
95.26	but it was at the Smithsonian.
97.26	"And it goes with a book that says, ""Read My Pins."""
100.26	(Laughter)
102.26	PM: So is this a good idea.
105.26	I remember when you were the first woman
107.26	as Secretary of State,
109.26	and there was a lot of conversation always
111.26	about what you were wearing,
113.26	how you looked --
115.26	the thing that happens to a lot of women,
117.26	especially if they're the first in a position.
120.26	So how do you feel about that -- the whole --
123.26	MA: Well, it's pretty irritating actually
125.26	because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing.
128.26	But people did pay attention to what clothes I had.
131.26	What was interesting was that,
133.26	before I went up to New York as U.N. ambassador,
135.26	I talked to Jeane Kirkpatrick, who'd been ambassador before me,
138.26	"and she said, ""You've got to get rid of your professor clothes."
141.26	"Go out and look like a diplomat."""
143.26	So that did give me a lot of opportunities to go shopping.
146.26	But still, there were all kinds of questions
149.26	"about -- ""did you wear a hat?"" ""How short was your skirt?"""
152.26	And one of the things --
154.26	if you remember Condoleezza Rice was at some event and she wore boots,
157.26	and she got criticized over that.
159.26	And no guy ever gets criticized. But that's the least of it.
162.26	PM: It is, for all of us, men and women,
165.26	finding our ways of defining our roles,
168.26	and doing them in ways that make a difference in the world
171.26	and shape the future.
173.26	How did you handle that balance
176.26	between being the tough diplomatic
179.26	and strong voice of this country
182.26	to the rest of the world
184.26	and also how you felt about yourself
186.26	as a mother, a grandmother, nurturing ...
189.26	and so how did you handle that?
191.26	MA: Well the interesting part was I was asked
193.26	what it was like to be the first woman Secretary of State
195.26	a few minutes after I'd been named.
197.26	"And I said, ""Well I've been a woman for 60 years,"
199.26	"but I've only been Secretary of State for a few minutes."""
202.26	So it evolved.
204.26	(Laughter)
206.26	But basically I love being a woman.
208.26	And so what happened --
210.26	and I think there will probably be some people in the audience
212.26	that will identify with this --
214.26	I went to my first meeting, first at the U.N.,
217.26	and that's when this all started,
219.26	because that is a very male organization.
222.26	And I'm sitting there -- there are 15 members of the Security Council --
225.26	so 14 men sat there staring at me,
229.26	and I thought -- well you know how we all are.
231.26	You want to get the feeling of the room,
233.26	"and ""do people like me?"""
235.26	"and ""will I really say something intelligent?"""
237.26	"And all of a sudden I thought, ""Well, wait a minute."
240.26	I am sitting behind a sign that says 'The United States,'
243.26	and if I don't speak today
245.26	"then the voice of the United States will not be heard,"""
248.26	and it was the first time that I had that feeling
250.26	that I had to step out of myself
252.26	in my normal, reluctant female mode
256.26	and decide that I had to speak on behalf of our country.
259.26	And so that happened more at various times,
262.26	but I really think that there was a great advantage in many ways
266.26	to being a woman.
268.26	I think we are a lot better
270.26	at personal relationships,
272.26	and then have the capability obviously
274.26	of telling it like it is when it's necessary.
277.26	But I have to tell you, I have my youngest granddaughter,
279.26	when she turned seven last year,
281.26	said to her mother, my daughter,
283.26	"""So what's the big deal about Grandma Maddie being Secretary of State?"
286.26	"Only girls are Secretary of State."""
288.26	(Laughter)
290.26	(Applause)
299.26	PM: Because in her lifetime -- MA: That would be so.
303.26	PM: What a change that is.
305.26	As you travel now all over the world,
308.26	which you do frequently,
310.26	how do you assess
312.26	this global narrative around the story of women and girls?
315.26	Where are we?
317.26	MA: I think we're slowly changing,
319.26	but obviously there are whole pockets
321.26	in countries where nothing is different.
323.26	And therefore it means that we have to remember
326.26	that, while many of us have had huge opportunities --
329.26	and Pat, you have been a real leader in your field --
332.26	is that there are a lot of women
334.26	that are not capable
336.26	of worrying and taking care of themselves
338.26	and understanding that women have to help other women.
341.26	And so what I have felt --
343.26	and I have looked at this
345.26	from a national security issue --
347.26	when I was Secretary of State, I decided
350.26	that women's issues had to be central to American foreign policy,
353.26	not just because I'm a feminist,
355.26	but because I believe that societies are better off
359.26	when women are politically and economically empowered,
362.26	that values are passed down,
364.26	the health situation is better,
367.26	education is better,
369.26	there is greater economic prosperity.
371.26	So I think that it behooves us --
374.26	those of us that live in various countries
377.26	where we do have economic and political voice --
380.26	that we need to help other women.
382.26	And I really dedicated myself to that,
384.26	both at the U.N. and then as Secretary of State.
387.26	PM: And did you get pushback
389.26	from making that a central tenant of foreign policy?
392.26	MA: From some people.
394.26	I think that they thought that it was a soft issue.
397.26	The bottom line that I decided
399.26	was actually women's issues are the hardest issues,
402.26	because they are the ones that have to do with life and death
405.26	in so many aspects,
407.26	and because, as I said,
409.26	it is really central to the way that we think about things.
412.26	Now for instance,
414.26	some of the wars that took place
416.26	when I was in office,
418.26	a lot of them, the women were the main victims of it.
421.26	For instance, when I started,
423.26	there were wars in the Balkans.
426.26	The women in Bosnia were being raped.
429.26	We then managed to set up a war crimes tribunal
432.26	to deal specifically with those kinds of issues.
435.26	And by the way, one of the things that I did at that stage
438.26	was, I had just arrived at the U.N.,
441.26	and when I was there, there were 183 countries in the U.N.
444.26	Now there are 192.
446.26	But it was one of the first times that I didn't have to cook lunch myself.
449.26	So I said to my assistant,
451.26	"""Invite the other women permanent representatives."""
454.26	And I thought when I'd get to my apartment
456.26	that there'd be a lot of women there.
458.26	I get there, and there are six other women, out of 183.
461.26	So the countries that had women representatives
464.26	were Canada, Kazakhstan, Philippines,
466.26	Trinidad Tobago, Jamaica,
468.26	Lichtenstein and me.
471.26	So being an American, I decided to set up a caucus.
474.26	(Laughter)
476.26	And so we set it up,
478.26	and we called ourselves the G7.
480.26	(Laughter)
482.26	"PM: Is that ""Girl 7?"" MA: Girl 7."
484.26	And we lobbied
486.26	on behalf of women's issues.
488.26	So we managed to get two women judges
491.26	on this war crimes tribunal.
493.26	And then what happened
495.26	was that they were able to declare that rape was a weapon of war,
498.26	that it was against humanity.
500.26	(Applause)
505.26	PM: So when you look around the world
507.26	and you see that, in many cases --
509.26	certainly in the Western world --
511.26	women are evolving into more leadership positions,
514.26	and even other places
516.26	some barriers are being brought down,
519.26	but there's still so much violence,
522.26	still so many problems,
524.26	and yet we hear there are more women
526.26	at the negotiating tables.
528.26	Now you were at those negotiating tables
530.26	when they weren't, when there was maybe you --
533.26	one voice, maybe one or two others.
535.26	Do you believe, and can you tell us why,
538.26	there is going to be a significant shift
541.26	in things like violence
543.26	and peace and conflict and resolution
546.26	on a sustainable basis?
548.26	MA: Well I do think, when there are more women,
551.26	that the tone of the conversation changes,
555.26	and also the goals of the conversation change.
558.26	But it doesn't mean that the whole world
560.26	would be a lot better
562.26	if it were totally run by women.
564.26	If you think that, you've forgotten high school.
567.26	(Laughter)
570.26	But the bottom line
572.26	is that there is a way,
574.26	when there are more women at the table,
577.26	that there's an attempt
579.26	to develop some understanding.
581.26	So for instance, what I did when I went to Burundi,
584.26	we'd got Tutsi and Hutu women together
587.26	to talk about some of the problems
589.26	that had taken place in Rwanda.
591.26	And so I think the capability of women
594.26	to put themselves --
596.26	I think we're better about putting ourselves into the other guy's shoes
599.26	and having more empathy.
601.26	I think it helps in terms of the support
604.26	if there are other women in the room.
606.26	When I was Secretary of State,
608.26	there were only 13 other women foreign ministers.
611.26	And so it was nice when one of them would show up.
614.26	For instance, she is now the president of Finland,
617.26	but Tarja Halonen was the foreign minister of Finland
620.26	and, at a certain stage, head of the European Union.
623.26	And it was really terrific.
625.26	Because one of the things I think you'll understand.
627.26	We went to a meeting,
629.26	and the men in my delegation,
631.26	"when I would say, ""Well I feel we should do something about this,"""
634.26	"and they'd say, ""What do you mean, you feel?"""
637.26	And so then Tarja was sitting across the table from me.
640.26	And all of a sudden we were talking about arms control,
643.26	"and she said, ""Well I feel we should do this."""
645.26	And my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden.
648.26	But I think it really does help
650.26	to have a critical mass of women
653.26	in a series of foreign policy positions.
656.26	The other thing that I think is really important:
659.26	A lot of national security policy
661.26	isn't just about foreign policy,
663.26	but it's about budgets, military budgets,
666.26	and how the debts of countries work out.
669.26	So if you have women
671.26	in a variety of foreign policy posts,
674.26	they can support each other
676.26	when there are budget decisions being made in their own countries.
679.26	PM: So how do we get
681.26	this balance we're looking for, then, in the world?
684.26	More women's voices at the table?
686.26	More men who believe
688.26	that the balance is best?
690.26	MA: Well I think one of the things --
692.26	I'm chairman of the board of an organization
694.26	called the National Democratic Institute
696.26	that works to support women candidates.
699.26	I think that we need
701.26	to help in other countries
703.26	to train women
705.26	to be in political office,
707.26	to figure out how they can in fact
709.26	develop political voices.
711.26	I think we also need to be supportive
714.26	when businesses are being created
717.26	and just make sure that women help each other.
719.26	Now I have a saying
721.26	that I feel very strongly about,
723.26	because I am of a certain age
725.26	where, when I started in my career,
727.26	believe it or not, there were other women who criticized me:
730.26	"""Why aren't you in the carpool line?"""
733.26	"or ""Aren't your children suffering"
735.26	"because you're not there all the time?"""
737.26	And I think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty.
740.26	"In fact, I think ""guilt"" is every woman's middle name."
744.26	And so I think what needs to happen
746.26	is we need to help each other.
749.26	And my motto is that there's a special place in hell
751.26	for women who don't help each other.
754.26	(Applause)
762.26	PM: Well Secretary Albright, I guess you'll be going to heaven.
766.26	Thank you for joining us today.
768.26	MA: Thank you all. Thanks Pat.
771.26	(Applause)
