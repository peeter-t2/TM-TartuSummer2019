12.988	When I wrote my memoir,
14.889	the publishers were really confused.
18.566	Was it about me as a child refugee,
22.8	or as a woman who set up a high-tech
22.8	software company back in the 1960s,
28.304	one that went public
30.38	and eventually employed over 8,500 people?
34.963	Or was it as a mother
34.963	of an autistic child?
39.47	Or as a philanthropist that's
39.47	now given away serious money?
43.925	Well, it turns out, I'm all of these.
46.569	So let me tell you my story.
51.779	All that I am stems from when
51.779	I got onto a train in Vienna,
58.446	part of the Kindertransport that saved
58.446	nearly 10,000 Jewish children
63.483	from Nazi Europe.
65.851	I was five years old, clutching the hand
65.851	of my nine-year-old sister
69.86	and had very little idea as to 
69.86	what was going on.
73.813	"""What is England and "
73.813	"why am I going there?"""
78.504	I'm only alive because so long ago, 
78.504	I was helped by generous strangers.
86.911	I was lucky, and doubly lucky
86.911	to be later reunited
90.446	with my birth parents.
92.885	But, sadly, I never bonded 
92.885	with them again.
99.917	But I've done more in the seven decades
99.917	since that miserable day 
103.227	when my mother put me on the train
105.003	than I would ever have dreamed possible.
108.29	And I love England, my adopted country,
111.398	with a passion that perhaps only someone
111.398	who has lost their human rights can feel.
117.831	I decided to make mine a life
117.831	that was worth saving.
124.188	And then, I just got on with it.
127.709	(Laughter)
131.264	Let me take you back to the early 1960s.
135.465	To get past the gender issues of the time,
139.953	I set up my own software house at one
139.953	of the first such startups in Britain.
146.443	But it was also a company of women,
146.443	a company for women,
152.301	an early social business.
155.325	And people laughed at the very idea
155.325	because software, at that time,
159.001	was given away free with hardware.
161.074	Nobody would buy software,
161.074	certainly not from a woman.
165.808	Although women were then coming out
165.808	of the universities with decent degrees,
171.745	there was a glass ceiling to our progress.
176.309	And I'd hit that glass ceiling too often,
180.985	and I wanted opportunities for women.
184.55	I recruited professionally qualified women
184.55	who'd left the industry on marriage,
189.042	or when their first child was expected
191.293	and structured them into a
191.293	home-working organization.
196.484	We pioneered the concept of women
196.484	going back into the workforce
201.069	after a career break.
203.611	We pioneered all sorts of
203.611	new, flexible work methods:
207.394	job shares, profit-sharing, 
207.394	and eventually, co-ownership
212.646	when I took a quarter of the company
212.646	into the hands of the staff
216.092	at no cost to anyone but me.
221.582	For years, I was the first woman this,
221.582	or the only woman that.
227.773	And in those days, I couldn't work
227.773	on the stock exchange,
231.539	I couldn't drive a bus or fly an airplane.
235.3	Indeed, I couldn't open a bank account
235.3	without my husband's permission.
241.193	My generation of women fought
241.193	the battles for the right to work
245.715	and the right for equal pay.
250.207	Nobody really expected much 
250.207	from people at work or in society
254.068	because all the expectations then 
256.566	were about home and 
256.566	family responsibilities.
260.461	And I couldn't really face that,
263.298	so I started to challenge
263.298	the conventions of the time,
269.287	even to the extent of changing my name
269.287	"from ""Stephanie"" to ""Steve"""
275.142	in my business development letters,
276.891	so as to get through the door
276.891	before anyone realized
279.369	that he was a she.
280.75	(Laughter)
284.054	My company, called Freelance Programmers,
284.054	and that's precisely what it was,
291.214	couldn't have started smaller: 
291.214	on the dining room table,
296.287	and financed by the equivalent
296.287	of 100 dollars in today's terms,
301.681	and financed by my labor and 
301.681	by borrowing against the house.
308.978	My interests were scientific, 
308.978	the market was commercial --
314.615	things such as payroll,
314.615	which I found rather boring.
318.64	So I had to compromise with 
318.64	operational research work,
323.752	which had the intellectual challenge 
323.752	that interested me
327.183	and the commercial value 
327.183	that was valued by the clients:
334.85	things like scheduling freight trains,
340.108	time-tabling buses, stock control,
340.108	lots and lots of stock control.
346.297	And eventually, the work came in.
350.545	We disguised the domestic and
350.545	part-time nature of the staff
354.3	by offering fixed prices,
354.3	one of the very first to do so.
359.44	And who would have guessed
359.44	that the programming
362.755	of the black box flight recorder 
362.755	of Supersonic Concord
366.699	would have been done by a bunch 
366.699	of women working in their own homes.
371.908	(Applause)
379.392	All we used was a simple 
379.392	"""trust the staff"" approach"
384.323	and a simple telephone.
386.504	We even used to ask job applicants, 
386.504	"""Do you have access to a telephone?"""
394.175	An early project was to develop
394.175	software standards
397.194	on management control protocols.
399.434	And software was and still is a
399.434	maddeningly hard-to-control activity,
405.636	so that was enormously valuable.
407.747	We used the standards ourselves,
409.971	we were even paid to update 
409.971	them over the years,
412.989	and eventually, they were adopted by NATO.
418.323	Our programmers -- remember, only women,
422.45	including gay and transgender --
425.896	worked with pencil and paper
425.896	to develop flowcharts
430.939	defining each task to be done.
434.596	And they then wrote code, 
434.596	usually machine code,
438.509	sometimes binary code,
440.776	which was then sent
440.776	by mail to a data center
445.506	to be punched onto
445.506	paper tape or card
449.724	and then re-punched, 
449.724	in order to verify it.
454.051	All this, before it ever got
454.051	near a computer.
457.387	That was programming in the early 1960s.
463.566	In 1975, 13 years from startup,
468.701	equal opportunity legislation 
468.701	came in in Britain
471.912	and that made it illegal to have 
471.912	our pro-female policies.
478.824	And as an example of 
478.824	unintended consequences,
482.4	my female company had to let the men in.
486.072	(Laughter)
491.014	When I started my company of women,
493.418	"the men said, ""How interesting, because"
493.418	"it only works because it's small."""
500.317	And later, as it became sizable, 
500.317	"they accepted, ""Yes, it is sizable now,"
506.136	"but of no strategic interest."""
510.125	And later, when it was a company
510.125	valued at over three billion dollars,
517.274	and I'd made 70 of the staff 
517.274	into millionaires,
521.877	"they sort of said, ""Well done, Steve!"""
525.397	(Laughter)
529.683	(Applause)
533.969	You can always tell ambitious women
533.969	by the shape of our heads:
538.255	They're flat on top for being 
538.255	patted patronizingly.
541.58	(Laughter) (Applause)
547.521	And we have larger feet to stand
547.521	away from the kitchen sink.
552.084	(Laughter)
553.737	Let me share with you 
553.737	two secrets of success:
557.562	Surround yourself with first-class people
557.562	and people that you like;
563.781	and choose your partner
563.781	very, very carefully.
570.065	Because the other day when I said, 
570.065	"""My husband's an angel,"""
573.278	a woman complained --
573.278	"""You're lucky,"" she said,"
575.764	"""mine's still alive."""
577.79	(Laughter)
585.117	If success were easy, 
585.117	we'd all be millionaires.
591.054	But in my case, it came in the midst
591.054	of family trauma and indeed, crisis.
601.258	Our late son, Giles, was an only child,
601.258	a beautiful, contented baby.
609.532	And then, at two and a half,
613.465	like a changeling in a fairy story,
616.738	he lost the little speech that he had
620.17	and turned into a wild, 
620.17	unmanageable toddler.
625.442	Not the terrible twos;
627.524	he was profoundly autistic 
627.524	and he never spoke again.
636.387	Giles was the first resident in the first
636.387	house of the first charity that I set up
641.734	to pioneer services for autism.
645.304	And then there's been
645.304	a groundbreaking Prior's Court school
648.304	for pupils with autism
650.724	and a medical research charity,
650.724	again, all for autism.
654.844	Because whenever I found a gap
654.844	in services, I tried to help.
661.313	I like doing new things 
661.313	and making new things happen.
666.583	And I've just started a three-year 
666.583	think tank for autism.
673.159	And so that some of my wealth does go back
673.159	to the industry from which it stems,
678.434	I've also founded 
678.434	the Oxford Internet Institute
682.017	and other IT ventures.
684.51	The Oxford Internet Institute
684.51	focuses not on the technology,
688.795	but on the social, economic, legal
688.795	and ethical issues of the Internet.
695.887	Giles died unexpectedly 17 years ago now.
702.909	And I have learned to live without him,
706.689	and I have learned to live 
706.689	without his need of me.
711.469	Philanthropy is all that I do now.
714.829	I need never worry about getting lost
717.188	because several charities
717.188	would quickly come and find me.
720.697	(Laughter)
732.807	It's one thing to have an idea 
732.807	for an enterprise,
736.885	but as many people in this room will know,
739.112	making it happen is a very difficult thing
742.025	and it demands extraordinary energy,
742.025	self-belief and determination,
750.117	the courage to risk family and home,
754.322	and a 24/7 commitment 
754.322	that borders on the obsessive.
759.491	So it's just as well
759.491	that I'm a workaholic.
763.475	I believe in the beauty of work when we
763.475	do it properly and in humility.
770.153	Work is not just something I do
770.153	when I'd rather be doing something else.
777.612	We live our lives forward.
779.756	So what has all that taught me?
784.21	I learned that tomorrow's 
784.21	never going to be like today,
787.846	and certainly nothing like yesterday.
790.899	And that made me able to cope with change,
794.306	indeed, eventually to welcome change,
798.634	though I'm told I'm still very difficult.
803.666	Thank you very much.
805.801	(Applause)
