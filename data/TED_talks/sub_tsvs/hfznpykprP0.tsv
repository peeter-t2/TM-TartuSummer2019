13.007	Now, Hegel -- he very famously said
16.016	that Africa was a place without history,
18.847	without past, without narrative.
20.959	Yet, I'd argue that no other continent
20.959	has nurtured, has fought for,
26.811	has celebrated its history
26.811	more concertedly.
30.303	The struggle to keep
30.303	African narrative alive
33.396	has been one of the most consistent
35.511	and hard-fought endeavors
35.511	of African peoples,
38.444	and it continues to be so.
40.441	The struggles endured and the sacrifices
40.441	made to hold onto narrative
45.176	in the face of enslavement, colonialism,
45.176	racism, wars and so much else
51.249	has been the underpinning narrative
53.284	of our history.
55.434	And our narrative has not just
55.434	survived the assaults
58.619	that history has thrown at it.
60.438	We've left a body of material culture,
64.184	artistic magistery
64.184	and intellectual output.
68.101	We've mapped and we've charted
68.101	and we've captured our histories
72.761	in ways that are the measure
72.761	of anywhere else on earth.
77.063	Long before the meaningful
77.063	arrival of Europeans --
81.643	indeed, whilst Europe was still
81.643	mired in its Dark Age --
85.207	Africans were pioneering techniques
85.207	in recording, in nurturing history,
91.287	forging revolutionary methods
91.287	for keeping their story alive.
96.823	And living history, dynamic heritage --
99.809	it remains important to us.
102.145	We see that manifest in so many ways.
106.576	I'm reminded of how, just last year --
106.576	you might remember it --
111.448	the first members
112.643	of the al Qaeda-affiliated Ansar Dine
115.092	were indicted for war crimes
115.092	and sent to the Hague.
118.338	And one of the most notorious
118.338	was Ahmad al-Faqi,
122.92	who was a young Malian,
124.388	and he was charged, not with genocide,
126.538	not with ethnic cleansing,
128.478	but with being one
128.478	of the instigators of a campaign
132.317	to destroy some of Mali's most
132.317	important cultural heritage.
136.762	This wasn't vandalism;
138.584	these weren't thoughtless acts.
141.389	One of the things that al-Faqi said
143.242	when he was asked
143.242	to identify himself in court
146.199	was that he was a graduate,
146.199	that he was a teacher.
149.661	Over the course of 2012,
149.661	they engaged in a systematic campaign
155.318	to destroy Mali's cultural heritage.
159.142	This was a deeply considered waging of war
163.491	in the most powerful way
163.491	that could be envisaged:
166.198	in destroying narrative,
166.198	in destroying stories.
170.21	The attempted destruction of nine shrines,
173.597	the central mosque
175.115	and perhaps as many as 4,000 manuscripts
178.632	was a considered act.
181.729	They understood the power of narrative
181.729	to hold communities together,
187.105	and they conversely understood
187.105	that in destroying stories,
191.347	they hoped they would destroy a people.
194.286	But just as Ansar Dine
194.286	and their insurgency
197.807	were driven by powerful narratives,
201.047	so was the local population's defense
201.047	of Timbuktu and its libraries.
205.428	These were communities who've grown up
205.428	with stories of the Mali Empire;
209.682	lived in the shadow
209.682	of Timbuktu's great libraries.
212.867	They'd listened to songs
212.867	of its origin from their childhood,
216.748	and they weren't about to give up on that
219.514	without a fight.
221.12	Over difficult months of 2012,
224.356	during the Ansar Dine invasion,
228.332	Malians, ordinary people,
228.332	risked their lives
232.182	to secrete and smuggle
232.182	documents to safety,
236.628	doing what they could
236.628	to protect historic buildings
239.958	and defend their ancient libraries.
242.282	And although they weren't
242.282	always successful,
244.96	many of the most important manuscripts
244.96	were thankfully saved,
248.667	and today each one of the shrines
248.667	that was damaged during that uprising
253.596	have been rebuilt,
255.412	including the 14th-century mosque
255.412	that is the symbolic heart of the city.
260.654	It's been fully restored.
262.494	But even in the bleakest periods
262.494	of the occupation,
266.923	enough of the population of Timbuktu
266.923	simply would not bow
272.34	to men like al-Faqi.
274.231	They wouldn't allow their history
274.231	to be wiped away,
277.318	and anyone who has visited
277.318	that part of the world,
280.609	they will understand why,
282.461	why stories, why narrative, why histories
282.461	are of such importance.
287.618	History matters.
289.978	History really matters.
293.227	And for peoples of African descent,
295.487	who have seen their narrative
295.487	systematically assaulted over centuries,
301.129	this is critically important.
304.131	This is part of a recurrent echo
304.131	across our history
308.203	of ordinary people making a stand
308.203	for their story, for their history.
314.385	Just as in the 19th century,
316.078	enslaved peoples of African
316.078	descent in the Caribbean
320.071	fought under threat of punishment,
322.409	fought to practice their religions,
322.409	to celebrate Carnival,
326.584	to keep their history alive.
329.343	Ordinary people were prepared
329.343	to make great sacrifices,
333.247	some even the ultimate sacrifice,
336.497	for their history.
338.965	And it was through control of narrative
341.434	that some of the most devastating
341.434	colonial campaigns were crystallized.
345.794	It was through the dominance
345.794	of one narrative over another
349.673	that the worst manifestations
349.673	of colonialism became palpable.
354.795	When, in 1874, the British
354.795	attacked the Ashanti,
358.712	they overran Kumasi
358.712	and captured the Asantehene.
362.364	They knew that controlling territory
362.364	and subjugating the head of state --
367.161	it wasn't enough.
368.742	They recognized that
368.742	the emotional authority of state
372.29	lay in its narrative
375.118	and the symbols that represented it,
377.704	like the Golden Stool.
379.706	They understood that control of story
379.706	was absolutely critical
385.197	to truly controlling a people.
387.468	And the Ashanti understood, too,
389.571	and they never were to relinquish
389.571	the precious Golden Stool,
394.005	never to completely
394.005	capitulate to the British.
399.289	Narrative matters.
401.657	In 1871, Karl Mauch, a German geologist
401.657	working in Southern Africa,
407.339	he stumbled across
407.339	an extraordinary complex,
411.42	a complex of abandoned stone buildings.
414.17	And he never quite recovered
414.17	from what he saw:
417.51	a granite, drystone city,
420.767	stranded on an outcrop
420.767	above an empty savannah:
424.592	Great Zimbabwe.
427.073	And Mauch had no idea who was responsible
430.589	for what was obviously
430.589	an astonishing feat of architecture,
435.679	but he felt sure of one single thing:
439.246	this narrative needed to be claimed.
443.06	He later wrote that the wrought
443.06	architecture of Great Zimbabwe
446.928	was simply too sophisticated,
449.691	too special to have
449.691	been built by Africans.
453.248	Mauch, like dozens of Europeans
453.248	that followed in his footsteps,
457.799	speculated on who
457.799	might have built the city.
460.603	And one went as far as to posit,
463.841	"""I do not think that I am far wrong"
463.841	if I suppose that that ruin on the hill
469.59	"is a copy of King Solomon's Temple."""
472.165	And as I'm sure you know, Mauch,
473.92	he hadn't stumbled upon
473.92	King Solomon's Temple,
476.888	but upon a purely African
476.888	complex of buildings
480.458	constructed by a purely
480.458	African civilization
484.109	from the 11th century onward.
486.089	But like Leo Frobenius,
486.089	a fellow German anthropologist
490.264	who speculated some years later,
492.633	upon seeing the Nigerian Ife Heads
492.633	for the very first time,
496.664	that they must have been artifacts
496.664	from the long-lost kingdom of Atlantis.
502.095	He felt, just like Hegel,
504.696	an almost instinctive need
504.696	to rob Africa of its history.
511.216	These ideas are so irrational,
513.646	so deeply held,
515.483	that even when faced
515.483	with the physical archaeology,
518.706	they couldn't think rationally.
520.739	They could no longer see.
522.761	And like so much of Africa's relationship
522.761	with Enlightenment Europe,
526.966	it involved appropriation, denigration
526.966	and control of the continent.
532.773	It involved an attempt
532.773	to bend narrative to Europe's ends.
537.955	And if Mauch had really wanted
537.955	to find an answer to his question,
542.172	"""Where did Great Zimbabwe"
542.172	"or that great stone building come from?"""
546.85	he would have needed to begin his quest
549.074	a thousand miles away from Great Zimbabwe,
551.787	at the eastern edge of the continent,
551.787	where Africa meets the Indian Ocean.
555.63	He would have needed to trace
555.63	the gold and the goods
558.862	from some of the great trading emporia
558.862	of the Swahili coast to Great Zimbabwe,
563.701	to gain a sense of the scale and influence
567.184	of that mysterious culture,
569.088	to get a picture of Great Zimbabwe
569.088	as a political, cultural entity
574.294	through the kingdoms and the civilizations
577.759	that were drawn under its control.
580.242	For centuries, traders have been drawn
580.242	to that bit of the coast
586.463	from as far away as India
586.463	and China and the Middle East.
591.233	And it might be tempting to interpret,
593.944	because it's exquisitely
593.944	beautiful, that building,
597.078	it might be tempting to interpret it
600.09	as just an exquisite, symbolic jewel,
603.642	a vast ceremonial sculpture in stone.
607.022	But the site must have been a complex
610.203	at the center of a significant
610.203	nexus of economies
614.782	that defined this region for a millennium.
618.395	This matters.
620.135	These narratives matter.
622.198	Even today, the fight to tell our story
622.198	is not just against time.
627.263	It's not just against
627.263	organizations like Ansar Dine.
631.01	It's also in establishing
631.01	a truly African voice
635.108	after centuries of imposed histories.
638.775	We don't just have
638.775	to recolonize our history,
642.23	but we have to find ways to build back
642.23	the intellectual underpinning
647.128	that Hegel denied was there at all.
649.866	We have to rediscover African philosophy,
652.61	African perspectives, African history.
657.651	The flowering of Great Zimbabwe --
657.651	it wasn't a freak moment.
661.185	It was part of a burgeoning change
661.185	across the whole of the continent.
665.182	Perhaps the great exemplification of that
665.182	was Sundiata Keita,
669.532	the founder of the Mali Empire,
671.749	probably the greatest empire
671.749	that West Africa has ever seen.
675.713	Sundiata Keita was born about 1235,
678.835	growing up in a time of profound flux.
682.928	He was seeing the transition
682.928	between the Berber dynasties to the north,
686.8	he may have heard about the rise
686.8	of the Ife to the south
690.094	and perhaps even the dominance
690.094	of the Solomaic Dynasty
695.235	in Ethiopia to the east.
697.516	And he must have been aware
697.516	that he was living through a moment
701.176	of quickening change,
702.895	of growing confidence in our continent.
706.37	He must have been aware of new states
709.559	that were building their influence
712.047	from as far afield as Great Zimbabwe
712.047	and the Swahili sultanates,
717.339	each engaged directly or indirectly
717.339	beyond the continent itself,
723.61	each driven also to invest in securing
723.61	their intellectual and cultural legacy.
729.794	He probably would have engaged
729.794	in trade with these peer nations
733.246	as part of a massive continental nexus
736.773	of great medieval African economies.
739.608	And like all of those great empires,
743.231	Sundiata Keita invested in securing
743.231	his legacy through history
748.856	by using story --
751.744	not just formalizing
751.744	the idea of storytelling,
757.461	but in building a whole convention
760.162	of telling and retelling his story
763.547	as a key to founding a narrative
765.988	for his empire.
767.607	And these stories, in musical form,
770.976	are still sung today.
775.371	Now, several decades
775.371	after the death of Sundiata,
778.699	a new king ascended the throne,
781.122	Mansa Musa, its most famous emperor.
785.309	Now, Mansa Musa is famed
785.309	for his vast gold reserves
788.49	and for sending envoys to the courts
788.49	of Europe and the Middle East.
793.238	He was every bit as ambitious
793.238	as his predecessors,
797.285	but saw a different kind of route
797.285	of securing his place in history.
801.576	In 1324, Mansa Musa
801.576	went on pilgrimage to Mecca,
805.607	and he traveled
805.607	with a retinue of thousands.
808.962	It's been said that 100 camels
808.962	each carried 100 pounds of gold.
815.644	It's been recorded that he built
815.644	a fully functioning mosque
819.184	every Friday of his trip,
821.375	and performed so many acts of kindness,
824.52	that the great Berber chronicler,
824.52	Ibn Battuta, wrote,
828.383	"""He flooded Cairo with kindness,"
831.366	spending so much in the markets
831.366	of North Africa and the Middle East
834.927	that it affected the price of gold
834.927	"into the next decade."""
840.081	And on his return,
841.652	Mansa Musa memorialized his journey
845.885	by building a mosque
845.885	at the heart of his empire.
851.792	And the legacy of what he left behind,
854.462	Timbuktu,
856.163	it represents one of the great bodies
856.163	of written historical material
861.447	produced by African scholars:
863.654	about 700,000 medieval documents,
866.9	ranging from scholarly works to letters,
870.123	which have been preserved
870.123	often by private households.
873.195	And at its peak,
873.195	in the 15th and 16th centuries,
876.702	the university there was as influential
880.714	as any educational
880.714	establishment in Europe,
883.784	attracting about 25,000 students.
886.802	This was in a city
886.802	of around 100,000 people.
890.392	It cemented Timbuktu
890.392	as a world center of learning.
895.594	But this was a very particular
895.594	kind of learning
899.825	that was focused and driven by Islam.
903.594	And since I first visited Timbuktu,
905.861	I've visited many other
905.861	libraries across Africa,
908.746	and despite Hegel's view
908.746	that Africa has no history,
914.065	not only is it a continent
914.065	with an embarrassment of history,
918.302	it has developed unrivaled systems
918.302	for collecting and promoting it.
923.634	There are thousands of small archives,
926.479	textile drum stores,
928.401	that have become more than repositories
928.401	of manuscripts and material culture.
933.296	They have become fonts
933.296	of communal narrative,
936.459	symbols of continuity,
938.743	and I'm pretty sure that many
938.743	of those European philosophers
941.893	who questioned an African
941.893	intellectual tradition
945.414	must have, beneath their prejudices,
948.315	been aware of the contribution
948.315	of Africa's intellectuals
953.53	to Western learning.
954.887	They must have known
956.149	of the great North African
956.149	medieval philosophers
959.001	who had driven the Mediterranean.
961.517	They must have known about
961.517	and been aware of
964.94	that tradition that is part
964.94	of Christianity, of the three wise men.
969.993	And in the medieval period,
969.993	Balthazar, that third wise man,
974.006	was represented as an African king.
976.733	And he became hugely popular
979.361	as the third intellectual leg
979.361	of Old World learning,
983.37	alongside Europe and Asia, as a peer.
987.652	These things were well-known.
991.552	These communities
991.552	did not grow up in isolation.
995.2	Timbuktu's wealth and power developed
995.2	because the city became
999.333	a hub of lucrative
999.333	intercontinental trade routes.
1003.437	This was one center
1005.627	in a borderless, transcontinental,
1008.201	ambitious, outwardly focused,
1008.201	confident continent.
1012.874	Berber merchants,
1012.874	they carried salt and textiles
1016.82	and new precious goods and learning
1016.82	down into West Africa
1020.644	from across the desert.
1023.224	But as you can see from this map
1026.719	that was produced a little time
1026.719	after the life of Mansa Musa,
1030.988	there was also a nexus
1030.988	of sub-Saharan trade routes,
1035.614	along which African ideas and traditions
1038.898	added to the intellectual
1038.898	worth of Timbuktu
1042.545	and indeed across the desert to Europe.
1046.42	Manuscripts and material culture,
1050.174	they have become fonts
1050.174	of communal narrative,
1055.125	symbols of continuity.
1057.192	And I'm pretty sure that
1057.192	those European intellectuals
1061.927	who cast aspersions on our history,
1065.685	they knew fundamentally
1065.685	about our traditions.
1070.155	And today, as strident forces
1070.155	like Ansar Dine and Boko Haram
1074.889	grow popular in West Africa,
1076.826	it's that spirit of truly indigenous,
1076.826	dynamic, intellectual defiance
1082.46	that holds ancient
1082.46	traditions in good stead.
1085.438	When Mansa Musa made Timbuktu his capital,
1088.661	he looked upon the city
1088.661	as a Medici looked upon Florence:
1092.663	as the center of an open, intellectual,
1092.663	entrepreneurial empire
1097.746	that thrived on great ideas
1097.746	wherever they came from.
1101.087	The city, the culture,
1103.36	the very intellectual DNA of this region
1106.502	remains so beautifully
1106.502	complex and diverse,
1110.219	that it will always remain, in part,
1112.912	located in storytelling traditions
1112.912	that derive from indigenous,
1117.248	pre-Islamic traditions.
1119.037	The highly successful form of Islam
1119.037	that developed in Mali became popular
1124.668	because it accepted those freedoms
1126.741	and that inherent cultural diversity.
1129.247	And the celebration of that complexity,
1131.698	that love of rigorously
1131.698	contested discourse,
1135.747	that appreciation of narrative,
1137.615	was and remains, in spite of everything,
1140.913	the very heart of West Africa.
1144.347	And today, as the shrines and the mosque
1144.347	vandalized by Ansar Dine
1148.953	have been rebuilt,
1150.134	many of the instigators
1150.134	of their destruction have been jailed.
1153.985	And we are left with powerful lessons,
1156.911	reminded once again
1156.911	of how our history and narrative
1161.291	have held communities
1161.291	together for millennia,
1165.222	how they remain vital
1165.222	in making sense of modern Africa.
1169.906	And we're also reminded
1171.44	of how the roots of this confident,
1171.44	intellectual, entrepreneurial,
1176.488	outward-facing, culturally porous,
1176.488	tariff-free Africa
1181.296	was once the envy of the world.
1184.181	But those roots, they remain.
1186.775	Thank you very much.
