12.504	I need to start by telling you a little bit
15.066	about my social life,
16.555	which I know may not seem relevant,
19.473	but it is.
21.22	When people meet me at parties
23.15	and they find out that I'm an English professor
25.342	who specializes in language,
27.739	they generally have one of two reactions.
31.189	One set of people look frightened. (Laughter)
36.378	They often say something like,
37.971	"""Oh, I'd better be careful what I say."
41.277	"I'm sure you'll hear every mistake I make."""
44.495	And then they stop talking. (Laughter)
48.553	And they wait for me to go away
50.95	and talk to someone else.
53.187	The other set of people,
55.222	their eyes light up,
57.647	and they say,
58.878	"""You are just the person I want to talk to."""
63.187	And then they tell me about whatever it is
65.607	they think is going wrong with the English language.
68.142	(Laughter)
70.511	A couple of weeks ago, I was at a dinner party
72.828	and the man to my right
75.065	started telling me about all the ways
77.1	that the Internet is degrading the English language.
80.381	He brought up Facebook, and he said,
83.62	"""To defriend? I mean, is that even a real word?"""
89.47	I want to pause on that question:
93.04	What makes a word real?
96.826	My dinner companion and I both know
98.91	"what the verb ""defriend"" means,"
102.077	"so when does a new word like ""defriend"""
104.777	become real?
106.858	Who has the authority to make those kinds
109.362	of official decisions about words, anyway?
112.78	Those are the questions I want to talk about today.
117.075	I think most people, when they say a word isn't real,
120.375	what they mean is, it doesn't appear
122.236	in a standard dictionary.
123.864	That, of course, raises a host of other questions,
126.327	including, who writes dictionaries?
131.724	Before I go any further,
133.048	let me clarify my role in all of this.
135.49	I do not write dictionaries.
137.998	I do, however, collect new words
140.695	much the way dictionary editors do,
143.75	and the great thing about being a historian
145.573	of the English language
146.64	"is that I get to call this ""research."""
150.276	When I teach the history of the English language,
152.62	I require that students teach me
155.377	two new slang words before I will begin class.
158.903	Over the years, I have learned
161.22	some great new slang this way,
164.454	"including ""hangry,"" which --"
168.492	(Applause) â€”
172.188	which is when you are cranky or angry
174.535	because you are hungry,
178.774	"and ""adorkable,"""
183.55	which is when you are adorable
185.257	in kind of a dorky way,
188.278	clearly, terrific words that fill
191.471	important gaps in the English language.
194.176	(Laughter)
198.389	But how real are they
201.06	if we use them primarily as slang
203.279	and they don't yet appear in a dictionary?
207.396	With that, let's turn to dictionaries.
210.213	I'm going to do this as a show of hands:
212.053	How many of you still regularly
214.387	refer to a dictionary, either print or online?
219.338	Okay, so that looks like most of you.
221.532	Now, a second question. Again, a show of hands:
224.697	How many of you have ever looked to see
227.902	who edited the dictionary you are using?
234.048	Okay, many fewer.
237.68	At some level, we know that there are human hands
241.36	behind dictionaries,
242.936	but we're really not sure who those hands belong to.
247.207	I'm actually fascinated by this.
249.547	Even the most critical people out there
252.02	tend not to be very critical about dictionaries,
254.614	not distinguishing among them
256.497	and not asking a whole lot of questions
258.568	about who edited them.
260.791	Just think about the phrase
262.414	"""Look it up in the dictionary,"""
264.89	which suggests that all dictionaries
266.567	are exactly the same.
268.273	Consider the library here on campus,
270.873	where you go into the reading room,
272.569	and there is a large, unabridged dictionary
275.442	up on a pedestal in this place of honor and respect
279.32	lying open so we can go stand before it
281.667	to get answers.
283.87	Now, don't get me wrong,
286.176	dictionaries are fantastic resources,
289.381	but they are human
290.93	and they are not timeless.
293.211	I'm struck as a teacher
295.013	that we tell students to critically question
298.23	every text they read, every website they visit,
301.964	except dictionaries,
303.452	which we tend to treat as un-authored,
306.617	as if they came from nowhere to give us answers
309.259	about what words really mean.
313.603	Here's the thing: If you ask dictionary editors,
317.2	what they'll tell you
318.358	is they're just trying to keep up with us
320.672	as we change the language.
322.427	They're watching what we say and what we write
324.912	and trying to figure out what's going to stick
327.07	and what's not going to stick.
329.22	They have to gamble,
330.537	because they want to appear cutting edge
332.286	and catch the words that are going to make it,
334.942	such as LOL,
337.381	but they don't want to appear faddish
339.585	and include the words that aren't going to make it,
342.127	and I think a word that they're watching right now
343.94	is YOLO, you only live once.
349.317	Now I get to hang out with dictionary editors,
351.811	and you might be surprised
353.319	by one of the places where we hang out.
355.535	Every January, we go
357.672	to the American Dialect Society annual meeting,
360.825	where among other things,
362.172	we vote on the word of the year.
365.93	There are about 200 or 300 people who come,
368.933	some of the best known
368.933	linguists in the United States.
371.373	To give you a sense of the flavor of the meeting,
373.231	it occurs right before happy hour.
376.532	Anyone who comes can vote.
378.608	The most important rule is
379.92	that you can vote with only one hand.
383.049	In the past, some of the winners have been
386.513	"""tweet"" in 2009"
388.998	"and ""hashtag"" in 2012."
392.403	"""Chad"" was the word of the year in the year 2000,"
395.462	because who knew what a chad was before 2000,
399.282	"and ""WMD"" in 2002."
403.696	Now, we have other categories in which we vote too,
406.497	and my favorite category
408.09	is most creative word of the year.
410.474	Past winners in this category have included
413.224	"""recombobulation area,"""
416.277	which is at the Milwaukee Airport after security,
420.08	where you can recombobulate.
422.64	(Laughter)
424.124	You can put your belt back on,
425.643	put your computer back in your bag.
430.289	And then my all-time favorite word at this vote,
433.621	"which is ""multi-slacking."""
435.847	(Laughter)
438.35	And multi-slacking is the act
440.633	of having multiple windows up on your screen
443.501	so it looks like you're working
444.902	when you're actually goofing around on the web.
446.996	(Laughter) (Applause)
453.381	Will all of these words stick? Absolutely not.
456.989	And we have made some questionable choices,
459.888	for example in 2006
461.565	"when the word of the year was ""Plutoed,"""
463.604	to mean demoted.
465.596	(Laughter)
470.586	But some of the past winners
472.955	now seem completely unremarkable,
475.87	"such as ""app"""
477.388	"and ""e"" as a prefix,"
479.401	"and ""google"" as a verb."
482.36	Now, a few weeks before our vote,
486.427	Lake Superior State University
488.208	issues its list of banished words for the year.
492.987	What is striking about this
494.92	is that there's actually often quite a lot of overlap
497.691	between their list and the list that we are considering
500.528	for words of the year,
502.778	and this is because we're noticing the same thing.
506.87	We're noticing words that are coming into prominence.
509.9	It's really a question of attitude.
512.053	Are you bothered by language
512.053	fads and language change,
515.72	or do you find it fun, interesting,
519.13	something worthy of study
520.484	as part of a living language?
523.369	The list by Lake Superior State University
525.525	continues a fairly long tradition in English
528.17	of complaints about new words.
530.443	So here is Dean Henry Alford in 1875,
534.795	"who was very concerned that ""desirability"""
537.041	is really a terrible word.
539.49	In 1760, Benjamin Franklin
542.224	wrote a letter to David Hume
543.68	"giving up the word ""colonize"" as bad."
547.483	Over the years, we've also seen worries
549.682	about new pronunciations.
551.572	Here is Samuel Rogers in 1855
554.62	who is concerned about some
554.62	fashionable pronunciations
557.219	that he finds offensive,
559.226	"and he says ""as if contemplate were not bad enough,"
562.714	"balcony makes me sick."""
565.132	(Laughter)
568.528	The word is borrowed in from Italian
570.878	and it was pronounced bal-COE-nee.
574.418	These complaints now strike us as quaint,
577.361	if not downright adorkable -- (Laughter) --
582.306	but here's the thing:
585.04	we still get quite worked up about language change.
589.413	I have an entire file in my office
591.475	of newspaper articles
594.537	which express concern about illegitimate words
597.23	that should not have been included in the dictionary,
599.109	"including ""LOL"""
600.557	when it got into the Oxford English Dictionary
602.627	"and ""defriend"""
604.402	when it got into the Oxford American Dictionary.
607.174	I also have articles expressing concern
609.391	"about ""invite"" as a noun,"
612.26	"""impact"" as a verb,"
614.216	because only teeth can be impacted,
617.187	"and ""incentivize"" is described"
620.162	"as ""boorish, bureaucratic misspeak."""
624.673	Now, it's not that dictionary editors
626.634	ignore these kinds of attitudes about language.
629.325	They try to provide us some guidance about words
631.88	that are considered slang or informal
634.15	or offensive, often through usage labels,
637.293	but they're in something of a bind,
638.983	because they're trying to describe what we do,
642.635	and they know that we often go to dictionaries
644.964	to get information about how we should use a word
647.732	well or appropriately.
649.64	In response, the American Heritage Dictionaries
652.664	include usage notes.
654.805	Usage notes tend to occur with words
656.922	that are troublesome in one way,
658.245	and one of the ways that they can be troublesome
661.11	is that they're changing meaning.
663.043	Now usage notes involve very human decisions,
666.469	and I think, as dictionary users,
668.528	we're often not as aware of those human decisions
670.77	as we should be.
671.869	To show you what I mean,
672.993	we'll look at an example, but before we do,
675.71	I want to explain what the dictionary editors
677.692	are trying to deal with in this usage note.
680.99	"Think about the word ""peruse"""
683.664	and how you use that word.
687.302	I would guess many of you are thinking
689.838	of skim, scan, reading quickly.
694.375	Some of you may even have some walking involved,
697.21	because you're perusing grocery store shelves,
699.456	or something like that.
701.127	You might be surprised to learn
703.611	that if you look in most standard dictionaries,
705.48	the first definition will be to read carefully,
708.253	or pore over.
710.697	American Heritage has that as the first definition.
713.556	They then have, as the second definition, skim,
716.521	"and next to that, they say ""usage problem."""
720.316	(Laughter)
722.226	And then they include a usage note,
724.314	which is worth looking at.
726.191	So here's the usage note:
728.102	"""Peruse has long meant 'to read thoroughly'..."
730.459	But the word is often used more loosely,
732.226	to mean simply 'to read.'...
734.386	Further extension of the word
734.386	to mean 'to glance over, skim,'
737.315	has traditionally been considered an error,
739.771	but our ballot results suggest that it is becoming
742.174	somewhat more acceptable.
743.87	When asked about the sentence,
745.269	'I only had a moment to peruse the manual quickly,'
750.075	found it unacceptable in 1988,
754.529	"and 48 percent in 2011."""
758.397	Ah, the Usage Panel,
760.358	that trusted body of language authorities
762.968	who is getting more lenient about this.
765.82	Now, what I hope you're thinking right now is,
767.89	"""Wait, who's on the Usage Panel?"
771.885	"And what should I do with their pronouncements?"""
774.997	If you look in the front matter
776.96	of American Heritage Dictionaries,
778.068	you can actually find the names
779.643	of the people on the Usage Panel.
781.212	But who looks at the front matter of dictionaries?
783.244	There are about 200 people on the Usage Panel.
786.291	They include academicians,
788.668	journalists, creative writers.
790.345	There's a Supreme Court justice on it
792.437	and a few linguists.
794.336	As of 2005, the list includes me.
799.168	(Applause)
803.342	Here's what we can do for you.
806.71	We can give you a sense
809.07	of the range of opinions about contested usage.
812.122	That is and should be the extent of our authority.
815.479	We are not a language academy.
818.89	About once a year, I get a ballot
821.837	that asks me about whether new uses,
824.869	new pronunciations, new meanings, are acceptable.
828.207	Now here's what I do to fill out the ballot.
831.099	I listen to what other people are saying and writing.
834.607	I do not listen to my own likes
836.851	and dislikes about the English language.
840.06	I will be honest with you:
841.529	"I do not like the word ""impactful,"""
844.478	but that is neither here nor there
846.48	"in terms of whether ""impactful"""
846.48	is becoming common usage
849.719	and becoming more acceptable in written prose.
852.97	So to be responsible,
854.018	what I do is go look at usage,
856.546	which often involves going to look
858.382	at online databases such as Google Books.
861.077	"Well, if you look for ""impactful"" in Google Books,"
863.897	here is what you find.
867.103	"Well, it sure looks like ""impactful"""
869.344	is proving useful
871.074	for a certain number of writers,
872.703	and has become more and more useful
874.303	over the last 20 years.
876.262	Now, there are going to be changes
878.415	that all of us don't like in the language.
881.049	There are going to be changes where you think,
883.233	"""Really?"
884.22	"Does the language have to change that way?"""
887.905	What I'm saying is,
889.588	we should be less quick
891.31	to decide that that change is terrible,
895.101	we should be less quick to impose
896.815	our likes and dislikes about words on other people,
900.116	and we should be entirely reluctant
903.03	to think that the English language is in trouble.
905.774	It's not. It is rich and vibrant and filled
909.97	with the creativity of the speakers who speak it.
912.98	In retrospect, we think it's fascinating
915.598	"that the word ""nice"" used to mean silly,"
918.976	"and that the word ""decimate"""
920.66	used to mean to kill one in every 10.
924.165	(Laughter)
929.162	We think that Ben Franklin was being silly
934.255	"to worry about ""notice"" as a verb."
936.904	Well, you know what?
938.367	We're going to look pretty silly in a hundred years
941.067	"for worrying about ""impact"" as a verb"
943.364	"and ""invite"" as a noun."
946.176	The language is not going to change so fast
948.416	that we can't keep up.
950.313	Language just doesn't work that way.
952.596	I hope that what you can do
954.209	is find language change not worrisome
957.038	but fun and fascinating,
959.076	just the way dictionary editors do.
962.085	I hope you can enjoy being part
964.047	of the creativity that is continually remaking
969.051	our language and keeping it robust.
972.327	So how does a word get into a dictionary?
975.247	It gets in because we use it
977.716	and we keep using it,
979.34	and dictionary editors are paying attention to us.
983.575	"If you're thinking, ""But that lets all of us decide"
986.695	"what words mean,"""
988.444	"I would say, ""Yes it does,"
992.495	"and it always has."""
994.847	Dictionaries are a wonderful guide and resource,
998.774	but there is no objective
998.774	dictionary authority out there
1002.27	that is the final arbiter about what words mean.
1006.043	If a community of speakers is using a word
1008.556	and knows what it means, it's real.
1012.152	That word might be slangy,
1013.52	that word might be informal,
1015.162	that word might be a word that you think
1017.067	is illogical or unnecessary,
1019.524	but that word that we're using,
1022.075	that word is real.
1024.433	Thank you.
1026.774	(Applause)
