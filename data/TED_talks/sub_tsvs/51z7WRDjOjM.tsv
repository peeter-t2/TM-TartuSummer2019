26	Good morning everyone. First of all, it's been fantastic
30	being here over these past few days.
33	And secondly, I feel it's a great honor to kind of wind up
37	this extraordinary gathering of people,
39	these amazing talks that we've had.
42	I feel that I've fitted in, in many ways,
45	to some of the things that I've heard.
48	I came directly here
52	from the deep, deep tropical rainforest in Ecuador,
57	where I was out -- you could only get there by a plane --
60	with indigenous people with paint on their faces
64	and parrot feathers on their headdresses,
66	where these people are fighting to try and keep the oil companies,
71	and keep the roads, out of their forests.
75	They're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest
79	in a world that's clean, a world that isn't contaminated,
82	a world that isn't polluted.
85	And what was so amazing to me, and what fits right in
88	with what we're all talking about here at TED,
91	is that there, right in the middle of this rainforest,
94	was some solar panels -- the first in that part of Ecuador --
99	and that was mainly to bring water up by pump
102	so that the women wouldn't have to go down.
104	The water was cleaned, but because they got a lot of batteries,
107	they were able to store a lot of electricity.
110	So every house -- and there were, I think, eight houses
112	in this little community -- could have light
115	for, I think it was about half an hour each evening.
118	And there is the Chief, in all his regal finery, with a laptop computer.
124	(Laughter)
126	And this man, he has been outside, but he's gone back,
131	"and he was saying, ""You know, we have suddenly jumped into"
137	a whole new era, and we didn't even know about the white man
144	and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world.
147	We want to know about health care.
150	We want to know about what other people do -- we're interested in it.
154	And we want to learn other languages.
156	We want to know English and French and perhaps Chinese,
160	"and we're good at languages."""
162	So there he is with his little laptop computer,
166	but fighting against the might of the pressures --
170	because of the debt, the foreign debt of Ecuador --
173	fighting the pressure of World Bank, IMF, and of course
177	the people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil.
182	And so, coming directly from there to here.
186	But, of course, my real field of expertise
189	lies in an even different kind of civilization --
193	I can't really call it a civilization.
196	A different way of life, a different being.
200	We've talked earlier -- this wonderful talk by Wade Davis
205	about the different cultures of the humans around the world --
208	but the world is not composed only of human beings;
213	there are also other animal beings.
215	And I propose to bring into this TED conference,
218	as I always do around the world, the voice of the animal kingdom.
222	Too often we just see a few slides, or a bit of film,
225	but these beings have voices that mean something.
228	And so, I want to give you a greeting,
230	as from a chimpanzee in the forests of Tanzania --
234	Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
241	(Applause)
250	I've been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania since 1960.
255	During that time, there have been modern technologies
259	that have really transformed the way
261	that field biologists do their work.
264	For example, for the first time, a few years ago,
267	by simply collecting little fecal samples
270	we were able to have them analyzed -- to have DNA profiling done --
275	so for the first time, we actually know which male chimps
279	are the fathers of each individual infant.
282	Because the chimps have a very promiscuous mating society.
286	So this opens up a whole new avenue of research.
289	And we use GSI -- geographic whatever it is, GSI --
296	to determine the range of the chimps.
300	And we're using -- you can see that I'm not really into this kind of stuff --
306	but we're using satellite imagery
309	to look at the deforestation in the area.
312	And of course, there's developments in infrared,
315	so you can watch animals at night,
317	and equipment for recording by video,
320	and tape recording is getting lighter and better.
323	So in many, many ways, we can do things today
326	that we couldn't do when I began in 1960.
331	Especially when chimpanzees, and other animals
334	with large brains, are studied in captivity,
336	modern technology is helping us to search
341	for the upper levels of cognition in some of these non-human animals.
345	So that we know today, they're capable of performances
349	that would have been thought absolutely impossible
351	by science when I began.
354	I think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled
358	in intellectual performance is one called Ai in Japan --
362	her name means love --
364	and she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her.
368	She loves her computer --
370	she'll leave her big group, and her running water,
373	and her trees and everything.
375	And she'll come in to sit at this computer --
377	it's like a video game for a kid; she's hooked.
379	She's 28, by the way, and she does things with her computer screen
383	and a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans.
389	She does very complex tasks, and I haven't got time to go into them,
394	but the amazing thing about this female is
396	she doesn't like making mistakes.
400	If she has a bad run, and her score isn't good,
403	she'll come and reach up and tap on the glass --
405	because she can't see the experimenter --
407	which is asking to have another go.
410	And her concentration -- she's already concentrated hard
413	for 20 minutes or so, and now she wants to do it all over again,
417	just for the satisfaction of having done it better.
420	And the food is not important -- she does get a tiny reward,
423	like one raisin for a correct response --
426	but she will do it for nothing, if you tell her beforehand.
430	So here we are, a chimpanzee using a computer.
435	Chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans also learn human sign language.
439	But the point is that when I was first in Gombe in 1960 --
444	I remember so well, so vividly, as though it was yesterday --
448	the first time, when I was going through the vegetation,
451	the chimpanzees were still running away from me, for the most part,
454	although some were a little bit acclimatized --
458	and I saw this dark shape, hunched over a termite mound,
462	and I peered with my binoculars.
464	It was, fortunately, one adult male whom I'd named David Greybeard --
469	and by the way, science at that time was telling me that I shouldn't name the chimps;
472	they should all have numbers; that was more scientific.
474	Anyway, David Greybeard -- and I saw that
477	he was picking little pieces of grass and using them
481	to fish termites from their underground nest.
484	And not only that -- he would sometimes pick a leafy twig
487	and strip the leaves --
489	modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose --
492	the beginning of tool-making.
495	The reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough
497	is at that time, it was thought that humans,
500	and only humans, used and made tools.
503	When I was at school, we were defined as man, the toolmaker.
507	So that when Louis Leakey, my mentor, heard this news,
511	"he said, ""Ah, we must now redefine 'man,' redefine 'tool,'"
514	"or accept chimpanzees as humans."""
517	(Laughter)
519	We now know that at Gombe alone, there are nine different ways
523	in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes.
527	Moreover, we know that in different parts of Africa,
529	wherever chimps have been studied,
531	there are completely different tool-using behaviors.
536	And because it seems that these patterns are passed
539	from one generation to the next, through observation,
542	imitation and practice -- that is a definition of human culture.
547	What we find is that over these 40-odd years
551	that I and others have been studying chimpanzees
554	and the other great apes, and, as I say, other mammals
557	with complex brains and social systems,
560	we have found that after all, there isn't a sharp line
564	dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom.
567	It's a very wuzzy line.
569	It's getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things
572	that we, in our arrogance, used to think was just human.
577	The chimps -- there's no time to discuss their fascinating lives --
581	but they have this long childhood, five years
584	of suckling and sleeping with the mother,
586	and then another three, four or five years
588	of emotional dependence on her, even when the next child is born.
593	The importance of learning in that time, when behavior is flexible --
596	and there's an awful lot to learn in chimpanzee society.
600	The long-term affectionate supportive bonds
603	that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother,
606	with the brothers and sisters,
608	and which can last through a lifetime,
611	which may be up to 60 years.
613	They can actually live longer than 60 in captivity,
616	so we've only done 40 years in the wild so far.
619	And we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism.
625	We find in their non-verbal communication -- this is very rich --
629	they have a lot of sounds, which they use in different circumstances,
634	but they also use touch, posture, gesture,
636	and what do they do?
638	They kiss; they embrace; they hold hands.
640	They pat one another on the back; they swagger; they shake their fist --
643	the kind of things that we do,
646	and they do them in the same kind of context.
649	They have very sophisticated cooperation.
651	Sometimes they hunt -- not that often,
654	but when they hunt, they show sophisticated cooperation,
657	and they share the prey.
660	We find that they show emotions, similar to -- maybe sometimes the same --
666	as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness, sadness, fear, despair.
671	They know mental as well as physical suffering.
673	And I don't have time to go into the information
676	that will prove some of these things to you,
678	save to say that there are very bright students, in the best universities,
682	studying emotions in animals, studying personalities in animals.
686	We know that chimpanzees and some other creatures
689	"can recognize themselves in mirrors -- ""self"" as opposed to ""other."""
694	They have a sense of humor, and these are the kind of things
698	which traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives.
704	But this teaches us a new respect -- and it's a new respect
709	not only for the chimpanzees, I suggest,
712	but some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet.
716	Once we're prepared to admit that after all,
719	we're not the only beings with personalities, minds
722	and above all feelings, and then we start to think
724	about ways we use and abuse
726	so many other sentient, sapient creatures on this planet,
732	it really gives cause for deep shame, at least for me.
739	So, the sad thing is that these chimpanzees --
743	who've perhaps taught us, more than any other creature, a little humility --
747	are in the wild, disappearing very fast.
750	They're disappearing for the reasons
752	that all of you in this room know only too well.
755	The deforestation, the growth of human populations, needing more land.
760	They're disappearing because some timber companies
763	go in with clear-cutting.
765	They're disappearing in the heart of their range in Africa
769	because the big multinational logging companies have come in and made roads --
774	as they want to do in Ecuador
776	and other parts where the forests remain untouched --
779	to take out oil or timber.
783	And this has led in Congo basin, and other parts of the world,
788	to what is known as the bush-meat trade.
790	This means that although for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years,
794	people have lived in those forests, or whatever habitat it is,
798	in harmony with their world, just killing the animals they need
801	for themselves and their families --
803	now, suddenly, because of the roads,
806	the hunters can go in from the towns.
808	They shoot everything, every single thing that moves
811	that's bigger than a small rat; they sun-dry it or smoke it.
816	And now they've got transport; they take it on the logging trucks
819	or the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it.
823	And people will pay more for bush-meat, as it's called,
828	than for domestic meat -- it's culturally preferred.
831	And it's not sustainable, and the huge logging camps in the forest
835	are now demanding meat, so the Pygmy hunters in the Congo basin
839	who've lived there with their wonderful way of living
843	for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted.
846	They're given weapons; they shoot for the logging camps; they get money.
849	Their culture is being destroyed,
852	along with the animals upon whom they depend.
855	So, when the logging camp moves, there's nothing left.
858	We talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity,
861	and I've seen it happening with my own eyes.
864	And the grim picture in Africa -- I love Africa,
868	and what do we see in Africa?
870	We see deforestation;
873	we see the desert spreading; we see massive hunger;
878	we see disease and we see population growth in areas
882	where there are more people living on a certain piece of land
886	than the land can possibly support,
888	and they're too poor to buy food from elsewhere.
891	Were the people that we heard about yesterday,
894	on the Easter Island, who cut down their last tree -- were they stupid?
898	Didn't they know what was happening?
900	Of course, but if you've seen the crippling poverty
902	in some of these parts of the world
904	"it isn't a question of ""Let's leave the tree for tomorrow."""
907	"""How am I going to feed my family today?"
909	Maybe I can get just a few dollars from this last tree
912	which will keep us going a little bit longer,
914	and then we'll pray that something will happen
917	"to save us from the inevitable end."""
920	So, this is a pretty grim picture.
923	The one thing we have, which makes us so different
927	from chimpanzees or other living creatures,
929	is this sophisticated spoken language --
932	a language with which we can tell children
934	about things that aren't here.
936	We can talk about the distant past, plan for the distant future,
940	discuss ideas with each other,
942	so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group.
946	We can do it by talking to each other;
948	we can do it through video; we can do it through the written word.
952	And we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards,
957	and we're destroying the world.
959	In the developed world, in a way, it's worse,
962	because we have so much access to knowledge
965	of the stupidity of what we're doing.
967	Do you know, we're bringing little babies
970	into a world where, in many places, the water is poisoning them?
975	And the air is harming them, and the food that's grown
979	from the contaminated land is poisoning them.
982	And that's not just in the far-away developing world; that's everywhere.
986	Do you know we all have about 50 chemicals
988	in our bodies we didn't have about 50 years ago?
992	And so many of these diseases, like asthma
996	and certain kinds of cancers, are on the increase
999	around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped.
1004	We're harming ourselves around the world,
1007	as well as harming the animals, as well as harming nature herself --
1011	Mother Nature, that brought us into being;
1014	Mother Nature, where I believe we need to spend time,
1018	where there's trees and flowers and birds
1020	for our good psychological development.
1023	And yet, there are hundreds and hundreds of children
1026	in the developed world who never see nature,
1028	because they're growing up in concrete
1030	and all they know is virtual reality,
1032	with no opportunity to go and lie in the sun,
1036	or in the forest, with the dappled sun-specks
1039	coming down from the canopy above.
1042	As I was traveling around the world, you know,
1045	I had to leave the forest -- that's where I love to be.
1048	I had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees
1051	for my students and field staff to continue studying
1055	because, finding they dwindled from about two million
1062	I knew I had to leave the forest to do what I could
1065	to raise awareness around the world.
1067	And the more I talked about the chimpanzees' plight,
1070	the more I realized the fact that everything's interconnected,
1075	and the problems of the developing world
1077	so often stem from the greed of the developed world,
1080	and everything was joining together, and making -- not sense,
1085	hope lies in sense, you said -- it's making a nonsense.
1089	How can we do it?
1090	Somebody said that yesterday.
1092	And as I was traveling around, I kept meeting young people who'd lost hope.
1097	They were feeling despair,
1100	"they were feeling, ""Well, it doesn't matter what we do;"
1103	eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die.
1105	"Everything is hopeless -- we're always being told so by the media."""
1109	And then I met some who were angry,
1112	and anger that can turn to violence,
1114	and we're all familiar with that.
1117	And I have three little grandchildren,
1121	and when some of these students would say to me
1124	"at high school or university, they'd say, ""We're angry,"""
1127	"or ""We're filled with despair, because we feel"
1130	"you've compromised our future, and there's nothing we can do about it."""
1134	And I looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren,
1136	and think how much we've harmed this planet since I was their age.
1140	I feel this deep shame, and that's why in 1991 in Tanzania,
1146	I started a program that's called Roots and Shoots.
1149	There's little brochures all around outside,
1153	and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future,
1157	I beg that you pick up that brochure.
1160	And Roots and Shoots is a program for hope.
1164	Roots make a firm foundation.
1166	Shoots seem tiny,
1168	but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls.
1171	See the brick walls as all the problems
1173	that we've inflicted on this planet.
1175	Then, you see, it is a message of hope.
1179	Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world
1181	can break through, and can make this a better world.
1185	And the most important message of Roots and Shoots
1188	is that every single individual makes a difference.
1192	Every individual has a role to play.
1194	Every one of us impacts the world around us everyday,
1198	and you scientists know that you can't actually --
1201	even if you stay in bed all day, you're breathing oxygen
1204	and giving out CO2, and probably going to the loo,
1208	and things like that --
1210	you're making a difference in the world.
1212	So, the Roots and Shoots program
1215	involves youth in three kinds of projects.
1220	And these are projects to make the world around them a better place.
1224	One project to show care and concern for your own human community.
1230	One for animals, including domestic animals -- and I have to say,
1234	I learned everything I know about animal behavior
1236	even before I got to Gombe and the chimps from my dog, Rusty,
1240	who was my childhood companion.
1243	And the third kind of project: something for the local environment.
1248	So what the kids do depends first of all, how old are they --
1252	and we go now from pre-school right through university.
1256	It's going to depend whether they're inner-city or rural.
1259	It's going to depend if they're wealthy or impoverished.
1264	It's going to depend which part, say, of America they're in.
1267	We're in every state now, and the problems in Florida
1270	are different from the problems in New York.
1273	It's going to depend on which country they're in --
1275	and we're already in 60-plus countries, with about 5,000 active groups --
1281	and there are groups all over the place that I keep hearing about
1285	that I've never even heard of, because the kids are taking the program
1288	and spreading it themselves.
1290	Why?
1292	Because they're buying into it,
1294	and they're the ones who get to decide what they're going to do.
1297	It isn't something that their parents tell them,
1299	or their teachers tell them.
1301	That's effective, but if they decide themselves,
1304	"""We want to clean this river"
1307	and put the fish back that used to be there.
1309	We want to clear away the toxic soil
1314	from this area and have an organic garden.
1316	We want to go and spend time with the old people
1319	and hear their stories and record their oral histories.
1324	We want to go and work in a dog shelter.
1326	"We want to learn about animals. We want ... """
1328	You know, it goes on and on, and this is very hopeful for me.
1332	As I travel around the world 300 days a year,
1336	everywhere there's a group of Roots and Shoots of different ages.
1339	Everywhere there are children with shining eyes saying,
1341	"""Look at the difference we've made."""
1344	And now comes the technology into it,
1346	because with this new way of communicating electronically
1351	these kids can communicate with each other around the world.
1355	And if anyone is interested to help us, we've got so many ideas
1358	but we need help -- we need help to create the right kind of system
1364	that will help these young people to communicate their excitement.
1368	But also -- and this is so important -- to communicate their despair,
1373	"to say, ""We've tried this and it doesn't work, and what shall we do?"""
1376	And then, lo and behold, there's another group answering these kids
1380	who may be in America, or maybe this is a group in Israel,
1383	"saying, ""Yeah, you did it a little bit wrong. This is how you should do it."""
1388	The philosophy is very simple.
1391	We do not believe in violence.
1394	No violence, no bombs, no guns.
1397	That's not the way to solve problems.
1399	Violence leads to violence, at least in my view.
1403	So how do we solve?
1405	The tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding.
1410	Know the facts, but see how they fit in the big picture.
1413	Hard work and persistence --don't give up --
1416	and love and compassion leading to respect for all life.
1421	How many more minutes? Two, one?
1423	Chris Anderson: One -- one to two.
1425	Jane Goodall: Two, two, I'm going to take two.
1427	(Laughter)
1428	Are you going to come and drag me off?
1430	(Laughter)
1432	Anyway -- so basically, Roots and Shoots
1436	is beginning to change young people's lives.
1439	It's what I'm devoting most of my energy to.
1443	And I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact,
1450	not just because you can share technology with us,
1453	but because so many of you have children.
1456	And if you take this program out, and give it to your children,
1461	they have such a good opportunity to go out and do good,
1465	because they've got parents like you.
1467	And it's been so clear how much you all care
1471	about trying to make this world a better place.
1473	It's very encouraging.
1475	But the kids do ask me --
1477	and this won't take more than two minutes, I promise --
1479	"the kids say, ""Dr. Jane, do you really have hope for the future?"
1484	"You travel, you see all these horrible things happening."""
1488	Firstly, the human brain -- I don't need to say anything about that.
1492	Now that we know what the problems are around the world,
1495	human brains like yours are rising to solve those problems.
1499	And we've talked a lot about that.
1501	Secondly, the resilience of nature.
1504	We can destroy a river,
1506	and we can bring it back to life.
1508	We can see a whole area desolated,
1513	and it can be brought back to bloom again, with time or a little help.
1518	And thirdly, the last speaker talked about -- or the speaker before last,
1524	talked about the indomitable human spirit.
1527	We are surrounded by the most amazing people
1531	who do things that seem to be absolutely impossible.
1535	Nelson Mandela -- I take a little piece of limestone
1538	from Robben Island Prison, where he labored for 27 years,
1541	and came out with so little bitterness, he could lead his people
1546	from the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath.
1549	Even after the 11th of September -- and I was in New York
1553	and I felt the fear -- nevertheless, there was so much human courage,
1559	so much love and so much compassion.
1562	And then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear --
1566	the fear that was leading to people feeling
1568	they couldn't worry about the environment any more,
1570	in case they seemed not to be patriotic --
1573	and I was trying to encourage them,
1575	somebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi,
1578	"""If you look back through human history,"
1581	"you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good."""
1585	And just after that a woman brought me this little bell,
1589	and I want to end on this note.
1591	"She said, ""If you're talking about hope and peace, ring this."
1596	This bell is made from metal from a defused landmine,
1602	from the killing fields of Pol Pot --
1605	one of the most evil regimes in human history --
1608	where people are now beginning to put their lives back together
1612	after the regime has crumbled.
1615	So, yes, there is hope, and where is the hope?
1619	Is it out there with the politicians?
1623	It's in our hands.
1625	It's in your hands and my hands
1627	and those of our children.
1629	It's really up to us.
1631	We're the ones who can make a difference.
1633	If we lead lives where we consciously leave
1635	the lightest possible ecological footprints,
1639	if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy
1642	and don't buy the things that are not,
1645	we can change the world overnight.
1648	Thank you.
