16.458	I would be willing to bet
16.458	I'm the dumbest guy in the room,
19.285	because I couldn't get through school;
19.285	I struggled with school.
22.271	But I knew at a very early age
22.271	that I loved money, I loved business
25.505	and I loved this entrepreneurial thing.
27.416	I was raised to be an entrepreneur.
29.225	What I've been really
29.225	passionate about ever since --
31.702	and I've never spoken
31.702	about this ever, until now --
34.543	so this is the first time
34.543	anyone's heard it,
36.624	except my wife, three days ago.
38.146	"She said, ""What are you talking about?"""
40.068	I told her that I think
40.068	we miss an opportunity
43.031	to find these kids
43.031	who have the entrepreneurial traits,
46.26	and to groom them or show them
48.26	that being an entrepreneur
48.26	is actually a cool thing.
50.962	It's not something
50.962	that is a bad thing and is vilified,
54.319	which is what happens in a lot of society.
56.767	Kids, when we grow up, have dreams,
59.926	and we have passions, and we have visions,
61.956	and somehow we get those things crushed.
63.913	We get told that we need to study harder
65.952	or be more focused or get a tutor.
68.613	My parents got me a tutor in French,
68.613	and I still suck in French.
73.732	Two years ago,
74.909	I was the highest-rated lecturer
74.909	at MIT's Entrepreneurial Master's Program.
78.527	It was a speaking event
78.527	in front of groups of entrepreneurs
81.354	from around the world.
82.535	When I was in grade two,
82.535	I won a citywide speaking competition,
85.522	but nobody had ever said,
85.522	"""Hey, this kid's a good speaker."
88.3	He can't focus, but he loves walking
88.3	"around and getting people energized."""
91.842	"No one said, ""Get him"
91.842	"a coach in speaking."""
93.886	They said, get me a tutor
93.886	in what I suck at.
96.017	So as kids show these traits --
96.017	and we need to start looking for them --
99.79	I think we should be raising kids
99.79	to be entrepreneurs instead of lawyers.
104.209	Unfortunately, the school system
104.209	is grooming this world to say,
107.751	"""Let's be a lawyer,"""
107.751	"or, ""Let's be a doctor."""
109.899	We're missing that opportunity,
111.401	because no one ever says,
111.401	"""Hey, be an entrepreneur."""
113.858	Entrepreneurs are people --
113.858	we have a lot of them in this room --
116.933	who have ideas and passions
116.933	or see these needs in the world
119.774	and decide to stand up and do it.
121.448	And we put everything on the line
121.448	to make that stuff happen.
124.322	We have the ability
124.322	to get the groups of people around us
127.075	that want to build that dream with us.
128.972	And I think if we could get kids
128.972	to embrace the idea at a young age,
132.679	of being entrepreneurial,
133.917	we could change everything
133.917	in the world that's a problem today.
136.928	Every problem out there,
136.928	somebody has the idea for.
139.358	And as a young kid,
139.358	nobody can say it can't happen,
141.989	because you're too dumb to realize
141.989	that you couldn't figure it out.
145.781	I think we have an obligation
145.781	as parents and a society
148.365	to start teaching our kids to fish
148.365	instead of giving them the fish --
152.555	"the old parable: ""Give a man"
152.555	a fish, you feed him for a day.
155.444	Teach a man to fish,
155.444	"you feed him for a lifetime."""
157.818	If we can teach our kids
157.818	to be entrepreneurial,
160.05	the ones that show the traits to be,
161.804	like we teach the ones who have
161.804	science gifts to go on in science,
164.955	what if we saw the ones
164.955	with entrepreneurial traits
167.392	and taught them to be entrepreneurs?
169.152	We could have these kids
169.152	spreading businesses
171.28	instead of waiting
171.28	for government handouts.
173.333	What we do is teach our kids
173.333	the things they shouldn't do:
176.087	don't hit; don't bite; don't swear.
177.899	Right now we teach our kids
177.899	to go after really good jobs;
180.957	the school system teaches them
180.957	to go after things like
183.561	being a doctor and being a lawyer
183.561	and being an accountant and a dentist
186.966	and a teacher and a pilot.
188.244	And the media says it's really cool
188.244	if we could go out
190.928	and be a model or a singer
192.451	or a sports hero like Luongo or Crosby.
195.41	Our MBA programs do not teach kids
195.41	to be entrepreneurs.
199.01	The reason I avoided an MBA program,
199.01	other than that I didn't get into any,
202.596	since I had a 61 percent
202.596	average out of high school,
205.083	then a 61 percent average
206.302	at the only school in Canada
206.302	that accepted me, Carlton,
209.001	is that our MBA programs don't teach
209.001	kids to be entrepreneurs.
211.991	They teach them to work in corporations.
213.942	So who's starting these companies?
213.942	It's these random few people.
217.069	Even in popular literature,
217.069	the only book I've ever found --
220.096	and this should be
220.096	on all your reading lists --
222.319	the only book I've ever found
223.733	that makes the entrepreneur
223.733	"a hero is ""Atlas Shrugged."""
226.337	Everything else in the world
226.337	looks at entrepreneurs
228.775	and says we're bad people.
230.07	I look at even my family.
231.302	Both my grandfathers and my dad
231.302	were entrepreneurs.
233.777	My brother, sister and I,
233.777	all three of us own companies as well.
236.824	We all decided to start these things
236.824	because it's the only place we fit.
240.415	We didn't fit in normal work;
240.415	we couldn't work for somebody else,
243.511	we're stubborn and we have
243.511	all these other traits.
245.875	But kids could be entrepreneurs as well.
247.812	I'm a big part of a couple organizations
249.749	called the Entrepreneurs' Organization
249.749	and the Young Presidents' Organization.
253.445	I just came back from speaking
253.445	in Barcelona at the YPO global conference.
256.914	And everyone I met over there
256.914	who's an entrepreneur
260.26	struggled with school.
261.8	I have 18 out of the 19 signs
261.8	of attention deficit disorder diagnosed.
265.403	So this thing right here
265.403	is freaking me out.
268.236	(Laughter)
270.664	It's probably why I'm a bit panicked,
272.487	other than all the caffeine
272.487	I've had and the sugar.
274.915	But this is really creepy
274.915	for an entrepreneur.
277.26	Attention deficit disorder,
277.26	bipolar disorder.
279.427	Do you know that bipolar disorder
279.427	is nicknamed the CEO disease?
282.451	Ted Turner's got it. Steve Jobs has it.
285.149	All three of the founders
285.149	of Netscape had it.
288.565	I could go on and on.
289.972	Kids -- you can see these signs in kids.
292.26	And we're giving them Ritalin and saying,
294.412	"""Don't be an entrepreneurial type."
296.529	Fit into this other system
296.529	"and try to become a student."""
299.203	Sorry, entrepreneurs aren't students.
300.999	We fast-track. We figure out the game.
302.856	I stole essays. I cheated on exams.
304.928	I hired kids to do my accounting
304.928	assignments in university
307.729	for 13 consecutive assignments.
309.26	But as an entrepreneur, you don't do
309.26	accounting, you hire accountants.
312.639	So I just figured that out earlier.
314.57	(Laughter)
316.26	(Applause)
318.069	At least I can admit I cheated
318.069	in university; most of you won't.
321.283	I'm also quoted -- and I told
321.283	the person who wrote the textbook --
324.641	I'm now quoted in that exact same
324.641	university textbook
327.197	in every Canadian university
327.197	and college studies --
330.027	in managerial accounting,
330.027	I'm chapter eight.
332.26	I open up chapter eight,
332.26	talking about budgeting.
334.57	I told the author,
334.57	after they did my interview,
336.789	that I cheated in that same course.
338.511	She thought it was too funny
338.511	to not include it.
340.926	But kids, you can see these signs in them.
343.299	The definition of entrepreneur
343.299	"is ""a person who organizes, operates"
346.622	and assumes the risk
346.622	"of a business venture."""
348.86	That doesn't mean you have
348.86	to go to an MBA program,
351.29	or that you have to get through school.
353.184	It just means that those few things
353.184	have to feel right in your gut.
356.379	"We've heard, ""Is it nurture"
356.379	"or is it nature?"" Right?"
358.869	Is it thing one or thing two? What is it?
360.871	Well, I don't think it's either.
360.871	I think it can be both.
363.524	I was groomed as an entrepreneur.
365.151	When I was growing up
365.151	as a young kid, I had no choice,
367.935	because I was taught at a very early age,
369.935	when my dad realized I didn't fit
369.935	into everything else
372.569	that was being taught to me in school,
374.428	that he could teach me
374.428	to figure out business at an early age.
377.403	He groomed us, the three of us,
377.403	to hate the thought of having a job
380.675	and to love the fact of creating companies
382.708	where we could employ other people.
384.407	My first business venture:
384.407	I was seven years old, in Winnipeg.
387.365	I was in my bedroom
387.365	with one of those long extension cords,
390.162	calling all the dry cleaners in Winnipeg
392.113	to find out how much they'd pay
392.113	me for coat hangers.
394.569	And my mom came into the room and said,
396.57	"""Where are you going to get the hangers"
396.57	"to sell to the dry cleaners?"""
399.894	"And I said, ""Let's go look"
399.894	"in the basement."""
402.017	We went down to the basement,
402.017	and I opened up this cupboard.
404.867	There was about 1,000 hangers
404.867	that I'd collected,
407.209	because, when I told her
407.209	I was going out to play,
409.535	I was going door to door
409.535	in the neighborhood
411.615	to collect hangers to put in the basement,
413.701	because I saw her
413.701	a few weeks before that --
416.321	you could get paid, they used to pay
416.321	two cents per coat hanger.
419.323	So I was like, well,
419.323	there's all kinds of hangers,
421.709	so I'll just go get them.
422.935	I knew she wouldn't want me to get them,
424.871	so I just did it anyway.
426.1	And I learned that you could
426.1	actually negotiate with people.
428.935	This one guy offered me three cents
428.935	and I got him up to three and a half.
432.431	I even knew at seven years old
433.901	that I could get
433.901	a fractional percent of a cent,
436.179	and people would pay it,
436.179	because it multiplied up.
438.55	At seven years old I figured it out.
440.305	I got three and a half cents
440.305	for 1,000 hangers.
442.538	I sold license plate
442.538	protectors door to door.
444.674	My dad actually made me go find someone
446.585	who would sell me them at wholesale.
448.369	At nine years old, I walked
448.369	around in the city of Sudbury
451.082	selling license-plate
451.082	protectors door to door.
453.264	And I remember
453.264	this one customer so vividly --
455.468	I also did some other stuff
455.468	with these clients, I sold newspapers,
459.043	and he wouldn't buy
459.043	a newspaper from me, ever.
461.219	But I was convinced I was going to get him
461.219	to buy a license-plate protector.
464.823	"And he's like, ""We don't need one."""
466.524	"I said, ""But you've got two cars."""
468.196	Remember, I'm nine years old.
469.626	"I'm like, ""You have two cars and they"
469.626	don't have license-plate protectors.
473.158	And this car has one license plate
473.158	"that's all crumpled up."""
475.996	"He said, ""That's my wife's car."""
477.574	"I said, ""Why don't we test one on her car"
477.574	"and see if it lasts longer?"""
480.935	So I knew there were two cars
480.935	with two license plates on each.
483.935	If I couldn't sell all four,
483.935	I could at least get one.
486.553	I learned that at a young age.
488.025	I did comic book arbitrage.
489.343	When I was about 10 years old,
489.343	I sold comic books
491.687	out of our cottage on Georgian Bay.
493.451	I would go biking
493.451	up to the end of the beach,
495.58	buy all the comics from the poor kids,
497.478	then go back to the other end of the beach
497.478	to sell them to the rich kids.
500.935	It was obvious to me: buy low, sell high.
502.935	You've got this demand
502.935	over here that has money.
505.207	Don't try to sell to the poor kids;
505.207	they don't have cash.
507.977	The rich people do. Obvious, right?
509.844	It's like a recession.
511.031	So there's a recession.
512.222	There's still 13 trillion dollars
512.222	circulating in the US economy.
515.262	Go get some of that.
515.262	I learned that at a young age.
517.874	I also learned, don't reveal your source:
519.888	I got beat up after four weeks of this,
521.795	because one of the rich kids found out
521.795	where I was buying my comics,
525.126	and didn't like that he was paying more.
527.071	I was forced to get
527.071	a paper route at 10 years old.
529.458	I didn't want a paper route, but my dad
529.458	"said, ""That's your next business."""
533.002	Not only did he get me one,
533.002	but I had to get two.
535.35	He wanted me to hire someone
535.35	to deliver half the papers,
538.065	which I did.
539.24	Then I realized: collecting tips
539.24	is how you made all the money.
542.272	So I'd collect tips and get payment.
544.024	I would collect for the papers --
544.024	he could just deliver them.
546.935	Because then I realized
546.935	I could make money.
548.974	By this point, I was definitely
548.974	not going to be an employee.
551.832	(Laughter)
553.228	My dad owned an automotive
553.228	and industrial repair shop.
555.784	He had all these old
555.784	automotive parts lying around.
558.224	They had this old brass and copper.
559.923	I asked what he did with it,
559.923	and he said he just throws it out.
562.924	"I said, ""Wouldn't somebody pay"
562.924	"for that?"" And he goes, ""Maybe."""
565.934	Remember: at 10 years old, 34 years ago,
567.887	I saw opportunity in this stuff,
567.887	I saw there was money in garbage.
571.01	And I collected it from the automotive
571.01	shops in the area on my bicycle.
574.386	Then my dad would drive me on Saturdays
574.386	to a scrap metal recycler
577.495	where I got paid.
578.674	And I thought that was kind of cool.
580.418	Strangely enough, 30 years later,
580.418	we're building 1-800-GOT-JUNK?
583.491	and making money off that, too.
585.003	I built these little pincushions
585.003	when I was 11 years old in Cubs.
588.081	We made these pincushions
588.081	for our moms for Mother's Day
590.701	out of wooden clothespins --
592.381	when we used to hang clothes
592.381	on clotheslines outside.
594.899	And you'd make these chairs.
596.289	And I had these little pillows
596.289	that I would sew up.
598.711	And you could stuff pins in them.
600.333	Because people used to sew
600.333	and they needed a pincushion.
604.317	But I realized you had to have options,
606.438	so I spray-painted
606.438	a whole bunch of them brown,
608.682	so when I went to the door,
608.682	"it wasn't, ""Do you want to buy one?"""
611.71	"It was, ""Which color would you like?"""
613.51	I'm 10 years old;
613.51	you're not going to say no,
615.642	especially if you have two options,
615.642	the brown one or the clear one.
618.847	So I learned that lesson at a young age.
620.796	I learned that manual labor really sucks.
623.178	Right, like cutting lawns is brutal.
626.191	But because I had to cut lawns
626.191	all summer for all of our neighbors
629.329	and get paid to do that,
630.536	I realized that recurring revenue
630.536	from one client is amazing,
634.03	that if I land this client once,
636.45	and every week I get paid by that person,
638.597	that's way better than trying to sell
638.597	one clothespin thing to one person,
642.935	because you can't sell them more.
644.58	So I love that recurring revenue model
644.58	I started to learn at a young age.
648.073	Remember, I was being groomed to do this.
648.073	I was not allowed to have jobs.
651.557	I would go to the golf course
651.557	and caddy for people,
653.999	but I realized there was this one hill
653.999	on our golf course, the 13th hole,
657.513	that had this huge hill,
658.711	and people could never
658.711	get their bags up it.
660.808	So I'd sit there in a lawn chair
660.808	and carry for all the people
663.721	who didn't have caddies.
664.921	I'd carry their golf bags to the top;
664.921	they'd pay me a dollar,
667.816	while my friends worked for hours
667.816	hauling some guy's bag around
670.801	for 10 bucks.
671.983	"I'm like, ""That's stupid."
671.983	You have to work for five hours.
674.728	That doesn't make sense. Figure out
674.728	a way to make more money faster.
677.953	Every week, I'd go to the corner store
677.953	and buy all these pops,
680.888	Then I'd deliver them
680.888	to these 70-year-old women playing bridge.
683.935	They'd give me their orders
683.935	for the following week.
686.403	I'd deliver pop and charge twice.
688.061	I had this captured market.
689.394	You didn't need contracts, you just needed
689.394	to have a supply and demand
693.078	and this audience who bought into you.
694.935	These women weren't going
694.935	to go to anybody else
697.155	because they liked me,
697.155	and I kind of figured it out.
699.657	I went and got golf balls
699.657	from golf courses.
701.799	But everybody else was looking in the bush
703.935	and looking in the ditches for golf balls.
706.011	I'm like, screw that. They're in the pond.
706.011	And nobody's going into the pond.
709.742	So I'd go into the ponds and crawl
709.742	around and pick them up with my toes,
713.154	just pick them up with both feet.
714.771	You can't do it onstage.
716.605	You get the golf balls,
716.605	throw them in your bathing suit trunks
719.558	and when you're done, you've got
719.558	a couple hundred of them.
722.321	But the problem is, people
722.321	didn't want all the golf balls.
725.102	So I just packaged them.
725.102	I'm like 12, right?
727.222	I packaged them up three ways.
728.683	I had the Pinnacles, DDHs
728.683	and the really cool ones.
731.106	Those sold for two dollars each.
732.661	Then I had the good ones
732.661	that didn't look crappy: 50 cents each.
735.731	And then I'd sell 50 at a time
735.731	of all the crappy ones.
738.333	And they could use those
738.333	for practice balls.
740.609	I sold sunglasses when I was in school,
743.487	to all the kids in high school.
745.108	This is what really kind of gets
745.108	everybody hating you,
747.719	because you're trying to extract money
747.719	from all your friends all the time.
751.241	But it paid the bills.
752.447	So I sold lots and lots of sunglasses.
754.34	Then when the school shut me down --
756.118	they called me into the office
756.118	and told me I couldn't do it --
759.071	I went to the gas stations and sold
759.071	lots of them to the gas stations
762.646	and had the gas stations
762.646	sell them to their customers.
765.217	That was cool because then,
765.217	I had retail outlets.
767.605	I think I was 14.
768.78	Then I paid my entire way through
768.78	first year of university at Carlton
772.06	by selling wineskins door to door.
773.716	You know you can hold
773.716	a 40-ounce bottle of rum
775.9	and two bottles of coke in a wineskin?
777.757	So what, right? But you know what?
779.415	Stuff that down your shorts
779.415	when you go to a football game,
782.205	you can get booze in for free.
783.667	Everybody bought them.
784.891	Supply, demand, big opportunity.
787.211	I also branded it, so I sold them
787.211	for five times the normal cost.
790.336	It had our university logo on it.
791.935	You know, we teach our kids
791.935	and we buy them games,
794.328	but why don't we get them games,
794.328	if they're entrepreneurial kids,
797.449	that nurture the traits
797.449	you need to be entrepreneurs?
799.96	Why don't you teach them
799.96	not to waste money?
802.274	I remember being told to walk
802.274	out into the middle of a street
805.21	in Banff, Alberta.
806.404	I'd thrown a penny out in the street,
808.238	"and my dad said, ""Go pick it up."
809.795	I work too damn hard for my money.
809.795	"I'm not going to see you waste a penny."""
813.431	I remember that lesson to this day.
815.139	Allowances teach kids the wrong habits.
817.057	Allowances, by nature,
817.057	are teaching kids to think about a job.
820.652	An entrepreneur doesn't expect
820.652	a regular paycheck.
823.653	Allowance is breeding kids at a young age
823.653	to expect a regular paycheck.
827.358	That's wrong, for me,
827.358	if you want to raise entrepreneurs.
830.071	What I do with my kids, nine and seven,
832.082	is teach them to walk
832.082	around the house and the yard,
834.576	looking for stuff that needs to get done.
836.577	Come and tell me what it is.
837.988	"Or I'll say, ""Here's what I need done."""
839.935	And then, you know
839.935	what we do? We negotiate.
842.057	They go around looking for what it is,
843.935	then we negotiate what they'll get paid.
845.935	They don't have a regular check,
847.585	but they have opportunities
847.585	to find more stuff,
849.847	and learn the skill of negotiating
849.847	and of finding opportunities.
852.935	You breed that kind of stuff.
854.365	Each of my kids has two piggy banks.
856.158	Fifty percent of all the money they earn
856.158	goes in their house account,
861.439	The toy account,
861.439	they spend on whatever they want.
863.834	The 50 percent in their house account,
863.834	every six months, goes to the bank.
867.366	they walk up with me.
868.541	Every year, all the money
868.541	in the bank goes to their broker.
871.363	Both my nine- and seven-year-olds
871.363	have a stockbroker already.
874.355	I'm teaching them
874.355	to force that savings habit.
876.579	It drives me crazy
876.579	that 30-year-olds are saying,
878.89	"""Maybe I'll start contributing"
878.89	"to my RSP now."""
881.106	Shit, you've missed 25 years.
882.861	You can teach those habits to young kids,
884.85	when they don't even feel the pain yet.
886.748	Don't read bedtime stories every night --
886.748	maybe four nights of the week,
890.934	and three nights, have them tell stories.
893.237	Why don't you sit down with kids
893.237	and give them four items,
896.021	a red shirt, a blue tie,
896.021	a kangaroo and a laptop,
898.935	and have them tell a story
898.935	about those four things?
901.388	My kids do that all the time.
902.81	It teaches them to sell,
902.81	teaches them creativity,
905.151	teaches them to think on their feet.
906.99	Do that kind of stuff, have fun with it.
908.935	Get kids to stand up
908.935	in front of groups and talk,
911.277	even if it's just
911.277	in front of their friends,
913.376	and do plays and have speeches.
914.882	Those are entrepreneurial traits
914.882	you want to be nurturing.
917.651	Show kids what bad customers
917.651	or bad employees look like.
920.323	Show them grumpy employees.
921.681	When you see grumpy
921.681	customer service, point it out.
924.185	"Say, ""By the way,"
924.185	"that guy is a crappy employee."""
926.531	"And say, ""These are good ones."""
928.115	(Laughter)
930.172	If you go into a restaurant
930.172	and have bad customer service,
932.93	show them what bad
932.93	customer service looks like.
935.194	(Laughter)
937.11	We have all these lessons in front of us,
939.11	but we don't take those opportunities;
939.11	we teach kids to get a tutor.
942.37	Imagine if you actually took
942.37	all the kids' junk in the house right now,
945.768	all the toys they outgrew two years ago
947.674	"and said, ""Why don't we sell"
947.674	"some of this on Craigslist and Kijiji?"""
950.919	And they actually sell it and learn
950.919	how to find scammers when offers come in.
954.634	They can come into your account
954.634	or a sub account or whatever.
957.542	But teach them how to fix
957.542	the price, guess the price,
960.051	pull up the photos.
961.935	Teach them how to do
961.935	that kind of stuff and make money.
964.615	Then 50 percent
964.615	goes in their house account,
968.286	My kids love this stuff.
969.518	Some of the entrepreneurial traits
969.518	you've got to nurture in kids:
972.608	attainment, tenacity, leadership,
972.608	introspection, interdependence, values.
976.078	All these traits, you can find in young
976.078	kids, and you can help nurture them.
979.699	Look for that kind of stuff.
981.063	There's two traits I want you
981.063	to also look out for
983.477	that we don't get out of their system.
985.692	Don't medicate kids
985.692	for attention deficit disorder
988.098	unless it is really, really freaking bad.
990.099	(Applause)
991.695	The same with the whole things
991.695	on mania and stress and depression,
994.837	unless it is so clinically brutal, man.
996.838	Bipolar disorder is nicknamed
996.838	"""the CEO disease."""
999.321	When Steve Jurvetson, Jim Clark
999.321	and Jim Barksdale have all got it,
1003.895	and they built Netscape --
1005.335	imagine if they were given Ritalin.
1007.069	We wouldn't have that stuff, right?
1008.935	Al Gore really would have had
1008.935	to invented the Internet.
1011.712	(Laughter)
1013.474	These are the skills
1013.474	we should be teaching in the classroom,
1016.413	as well as everything else.
1017.732	I'm not saying don't get kids
1017.732	to want to be lawyers.
1020.252	But how about getting entrepreneurship
1020.252	to be ranked right up there
1023.429	with the rest of them?
1024.605	Because there's huge
1024.605	opportunities in that.
1026.659	I want to close with a quick video
1028.39	that was done by one
1028.39	of the companies I mentor.
1030.645	These guys, Grasshopper.
1032.163	It's about kids.
1033.352	It's about entrepreneurship.
1034.742	Hopefully, this inspires you
1034.742	to take what you've heard from me
1037.691	and do something with it
1037.691	to change the world.
1040.164	"[Kid... ""And you thought"
1040.164	"you could do anything?""]"
1042.482	[You still can.]
1044.483	[Because a lot of what
1044.483	we consider impossible]
1047.34	[is easy to overcome]
1049.935	[Because in case you haven't
1049.935	noticed, we live in a place where]
1052.959	[one individual can make a difference]
1055.721	[Want proof?]
1056.944	[Just look at the people
1056.944	who built our country:]
1059.255	[Our parents, grandparents,
1059.255	our aunts, uncles]
1061.472	[They were immigrants, newcomers
1061.472	ready to make their mark]
1064.266	[Maybe they came with very little]
1066.935	[or perhaps they didn't own
1066.935	anything except for]
1069.219	[a single brilliant idea]
1072.109	[These people were thinkers, doers]
1075.768	[innovators]
1077.649	[until they came up with the name]
1081.409	[entrepreneurs]
1084.424	[They change the way we think
1084.424	about what is possible.]
1087.002	[They have a clear vision
1087.002	of how life can be better]
1089.573	[for all of us, even when
1089.573	times are tough.]
1091.792	[Right now, it's hard to see]
1093.248	[when our view is cluttered
1093.248	with obstacles.]
1096.003	[But turbulence creates opportunities]
1100.273	[for success, achievement, and pushes us]
1103.919	[to discover new ways of doing things]
1106.226	[So what opportunities
1106.226	will you go after and why?]
1108.987	[If you're an entrepreneur]
1111.434	[you know that risk isn't the reward.]
1114.34	[No. The rewards are driving innovation]
1117.208	[changing people's lives. Creating jobs.]
1119.609	[Fueling growth.]
1121.791	[And making a better world.]
1124.935	[Entrepreneurs are everywhere.]
1126.464	[They run small businesses
1126.464	that support our economy,]
1129.021	[design tools to help you]
1130.287	[stay connected with friends,
1130.287	family and colleagues]
1132.749	[And they're finding new ways of helping
1132.749	to solve society's oldest problems.]
1136.409	[Do you know an entrepreneur?]
1137.868	[Entrepreneurs can be anyone
1137.868	Even... you]
1139.943	[So seize the opportunity to create
1139.943	the job you always wanted]
1143.016	[Help heal the economy]
1144.604	[Make a difference.]
1145.78	[Take your business to new heights,]
1148.863	[but most importantly,]
1150.156	[remember when you were a kid]
1153.776	[when everything was within your reach,]
1156.808	[and then say to yourself
1156.808	quietly, but with determination:]
1162.855	[it still is.]
1167.41	Thank you very much for having me.
1169.086	(Applause)
