15.26	I'm a savant,
17.26	or more precisely,
19.26	a high-functioning
21.26	autistic savant.
23.26	It's a rare condition.
25.26	And rarer still when accompanied,
28.26	as in my case,
30.26	by self-awareness
32.26	and a mastery of language.
35.26	Very often when I meet someone
38.26	and they learn this about me,
40.26	there's a certain kind of awkwardness.
43.26	I can see it in their eyes.
46.26	They want to ask me something.
49.26	And in the end, quite often,
51.26	the urge is stronger than they are
54.26	and they blurt it out:
56.26	"""If I give you my date of birth,"
58.26	"can you tell me what day of the week I was born on?"""
60.26	(Laughter)
63.26	Or they mention cube roots
66.26	or ask me to recite a long number or long text.
70.26	I hope you'll forgive me
72.26	if I don't perform
75.26	a kind of one-man savant show for you today.
79.26	I'm going to talk instead
82.26	about something
84.26	far more interesting
86.26	than dates of birth or cube roots --
89.26	a little deeper
91.26	and a lot closer, to my mind, than work.
94.26	I want to talk to you briefly
96.26	about perception.
99.26	When he was writing the plays and the short stories
102.26	that would make his name,
104.26	Anton Chekhov kept a notebook
107.26	in which he noted down
109.26	his observations
111.26	of the world around him --
113.26	little details
115.26	that other people seem to miss.
118.26	Every time I read Chekhov
121.26	and his unique vision of human life,
125.26	I'm reminded of why I too
127.26	became a writer.
129.26	In my books,
131.26	I explore the nature of perception
133.26	and how different kinds of perceiving
136.26	create different kinds of knowing
138.26	and understanding.
143.26	Here are three questions
145.26	drawn from my work.
147.26	Rather than try to figure them out,
149.26	I'm going to ask you to consider for a moment
152.26	the intuitions
154.26	and the gut instincts
156.26	that are going through your head and your heart
158.26	as you look at them.
161.26	For example, the calculation:
164.26	can you feel where on the number line
166.26	the solution is likely to fall?
169.26	Or look at the foreign word and the sounds:
172.26	can you get a sense of the range of meanings
174.26	that it's pointing you towards?
177.26	And in terms of the line of poetry,
180.26	why does the poet use the word hare
182.26	rather than rabbit?
186.26	I'm asking you to do this
188.26	because I believe our personal perceptions, you see,
192.26	are at the heart
194.26	of how we acquire knowledge.
196.26	Aesthetic judgments,
198.26	rather than abstract reasoning,
201.26	guide and shape the process
203.26	by which we all come to know
206.26	what we know.
208.26	I'm an extreme example of this.
211.26	My worlds of words and numbers
214.26	blur with color, emotion
216.26	and personality.
218.26	As Juan said,
220.26	it's the condition that scientists call synesthesia,
223.26	an unusual cross-talk
225.26	between the senses.
231.26	Here are the numbers one to 12
233.26	as I see them --
235.26	every number with its own shape and character.
239.26	One is a flash of white light.
241.26	Six is a tiny and very sad black hole.
246.26	The sketches are in black and white here,
249.26	but in my mind they have colors.
251.26	Three is green.
253.26	Four is blue.
255.26	Five is yellow.
260.26	I paint as well.
262.26	And here is one of my paintings.
265.26	It's a multiplication of two prime numbers.
269.26	Three-dimensional shapes
271.26	and the space they create in the middle
274.26	creates a new shape,
276.26	the answer to the sum.
279.26	What about bigger numbers?
281.26	Well you can't get much bigger than Pi,
285.26	the mathematical constant.
287.26	It's an infinite number --
289.26	literally goes on forever.
291.26	In this painting that I made
293.26	of the first 20 decimals of Pi,
297.26	I take the colors
299.26	and the emotions and the textures
302.26	and I pull them all together
304.26	into a kind of rolling numerical landscape.
309.26	But it's not only numbers that I see in colors.
312.26	Words too, for me,
314.26	have colors and emotions
316.26	and textures.
318.26	And this is an opening phrase
320.26	"from the novel ""Lolita."""
322.26	And Nabokov was himself synesthetic.
326.26	And you can see here
328.26	how my perception of the sound L
331.26	helps the alliteration
333.26	to jump right out.
336.26	Another example:
338.26	a little bit more mathematical.
340.26	And I wonder if some of you will notice
342.26	the construction of the sentence
344.26	"from ""The Great Gatsby."""
348.26	There is a procession of syllables --
351.26	wheat, one;
353.26	prairies, two;
355.26	lost Swede towns, three --
358.26	one, two, three.
360.26	And this effect is very pleasant on the mind,
364.26	and it helps the sentence
366.26	to feel right.
369.26	Let's go back to the questions
371.26	I posed you a moment ago.
377.26	If some of you play chess,
380.26	you'll know that 64
382.26	is a square number,
385.26	and that's why chessboards,
387.26	eight by eight,
389.26	have 64 squares.
392.26	So that gives us a form
394.26	that we can picture, that we can perceive.
397.26	What about 75?
400.26	Well if 100,
402.26	if we think of 100 as being like a square,
408.26	So what we need to do now
410.26	is put those two pictures
412.26	together in our mind --
414.26	something like this.
421.26	And in the right-hand corner,
425.26	you don't have to calculate anything.
427.26	Four across, four up and down --
429.26	it's 16.
432.26	So what the sum is actually asking you to do
434.26	is 16,
439.26	That's a lot easier
441.26	than the way that the school taught you to do math, I'm sure.
444.26	It's 16, 16, 16, 48,
446.26	4,800 --
448.26	4,800,
450.26	the answer to the sum.
453.26	Easy when you know how.
455.26	(Laughter)
458.26	The second question was an Icelandic word.
461.26	I'm assuming there are not many people here
464.26	who speak Icelandic.
466.26	So let me narrow the choices down to two.
471.26	Hnugginn:
473.26	is it a happy word,
475.26	or a sad word?
477.26	What do you say?
480.26	Okay.
482.26	Some people say it's happy.
484.26	Most people, a majority of people,
486.26	say sad.
488.26	And it actually means sad.
492.26	(Laughter)
495.26	Why do, statistically,
498.26	a majority of people
500.26	say that a word is sad, in this case,
502.26	heavy in other cases?
505.26	In my theory, language evolves in such a way
508.26	that sounds match,
510.26	correspond with, the subjective,
513.26	with the personal,
515.26	intuitive experience
517.26	of the listener.
520.26	Let's have a look at the third question.
524.26	It's a line from a poem by John Keats.
527.26	Words, like numbers,
530.26	express fundamental relationships
533.26	between objects
535.26	and events and forces
537.26	that constitute our world.
539.26	It stands to reason that we, existing in this world,
542.26	should in the course of our lives
544.26	absorb intuitively those relationships.
547.26	And poets, like other artists,
550.26	play with those intuitive understandings.
553.26	In the case of hare,
556.26	it's an ambiguous sound in English.
558.26	It can also mean the fibers that grow from a head.
561.26	And if we think of that --
563.26	let me put the picture up --
565.26	the fibers represent vulnerability.
569.26	They yield to the slightest movement
572.26	or motion or emotion.
575.26	So what you have is an atmosphere
579.26	of vulnerability and tension.
581.26	The hare itself, the animal --
583.26	not a cat, not a dog, a hare --
586.26	why a hare?
588.26	Because think of the picture --
590.26	not the word, the picture.
592.26	The overlong ears,
594.26	the overlarge feet,
596.26	helps us to picture, to feel intuitively,
599.26	what it means to limp
602.26	and to tremble.
605.26	So in these few minutes,
607.26	I hope I've been able to share
609.26	a little bit of my vision of things
612.26	and to show you
615.26	that words can have colors and emotions,
618.26	numbers, shapes and personalities.
621.26	The world is richer,
623.26	vaster
625.26	than it too often seems to be.
628.26	I hope that I've given you the desire
631.26	to learn to see the world with new eyes.
634.26	Thank you.
636.26	(Applause)
