12.954	My colleagues and I are fascinated
12.954	by the science of moving dots.
16.927	So what are these dots?
18.101	Well, it's all of us.
19.412	And we're moving in our homes,
19.412	in our offices, as we shop and travel
24.521	throughout our cities
24.521	and around the world.
26.958	And wouldn't it be great
26.958	if we could understand all this movement?
30.918	If we could find patterns and meaning
30.918	and insight in it.
34.259	And luckily for us, we live in a time
36.068	where we're incredibly good
36.068	at capturing information about ourselves.
40.807	So whether it's through
40.807	sensors or videos, or apps,
44.494	we can track our movement
44.494	with incredibly fine detail.
48.092	So it turns out one of the places
48.092	where we have the best data about movement
53.148	is sports.
54.682	So whether it's basketball or baseball,
54.682	or football or the other football,
60.039	we're instrumenting our stadiums
60.039	and our players to track their movements
64.465	every fraction of a second.
65.802	So what we're doing
65.802	is turning our athletes into --
70.208	you probably guessed it --
72.191	moving dots.
73.946	So we've got mountains of moving dots
73.946	and like most raw data,
78.904	it's hard to deal with
78.904	and not that interesting.
81.43	But there are things that, for example,
81.43	basketball coaches want to know.
85.223	And the problem is they can't know them
85.223	because they'd have to watch every second
89.057	of every game, remember it and process it.
91.804	And a person can't do that,
93.758	but a machine can.
95.661	The problem is a machine can't see
95.661	the game with the eye of a coach.
99.363	At least they couldn't until now.
102.228	So what have we taught the machine to see?
105.569	So, we started simply.
107.38	We taught it things like passes,
107.38	shots and rebounds.
111.203	Things that most casual fans would know.
113.768	And then we moved on to things
113.768	slightly more complicated.
116.624	Events like post-ups,
116.624	and pick-and-rolls, and isolations.
121.377	And if you don't know them, that's okay.
121.377	Most casual players probably do.
125.56	Now, we've gotten to a point where today,
125.56	the machine understands complex events
130.924	like down screens and wide pins.
134.021	Basically things only professionals know.
136.771	So we have taught a machine to see
136.771	with the eyes of a coach.
142.009	So how have we been able to do this?
144.511	If I asked a coach to describe
144.511	something like a pick-and-roll,
147.653	they would give me a description,
149.317	and if I encoded that as an algorithm,
149.317	it would be terrible.
153.026	The pick-and-roll happens to be this dance
153.026	in basketball between four players,
157.328	two on offense and two on defense.
159.486	And here's kind of how it goes.
161.128	So there's the guy on offense
161.128	without the ball
163.685	the ball and he goes next to the guy
163.685	guarding the guy with the ball,
166.918	and he kind of stays there
168.199	and they both move and stuff happens,
168.199	and ta-da, it's a pick-and-roll.
171.54	(Laughter)
173.779	So that is also an example
173.779	of a terrible algorithm.
176.913	So, if the player who's the interferer --
176.913	he's called the screener --
181.278	goes close by, but he doesn't stop,
184.174	it's probably not a pick-and-roll.
186.56	Or if he does stop,
186.56	but he doesn't stop close enough,
190.529	it's probably not a pick-and-roll.
192.642	Or, if he does go close by
192.642	and he does stop
195.903	but they do it under the basket,
195.903	it's probably not a pick-and-roll.
199.462	Or I could be wrong,
199.462	they could all be pick-and-rolls.
202.01	It really depends on the exact timing,
202.01	the distances, the locations,
206.602	and that's what makes it hard.
208.579	So, luckily, with machine learning,
208.579	we can go beyond our own ability
213.547	to describe the things we know.
215.314	So how does this work?
215.314	Well, it's by example.
217.759	So we go to the machine and say,
217.759	"""Good morning, machine."
221.077	Here are some pick-and-rolls,
221.077	and here are some things that are not.
224.72	"Please find a way to tell the difference."""
227.076	And the key to all of this is to find
227.076	features that enable it to separate.
230.807	So if I was going
230.807	to teach it the difference
232.94	between an apple and orange,
234.345	"I might say, ""Why don't you"
234.345	"use color or shape?"""
236.744	And the problem that we're solving is,
236.744	what are those things?
239.711	What are the key features
240.982	that let a computer navigate
240.982	the world of moving dots?
244.505	So figuring out all these relationships
244.505	with relative and absolute location,
249.352	distance, timing, velocities --
251.44	that's really the key to the science
251.44	of moving dots, or as we like to call it,
256.392	spatiotemporal pattern recognition,
256.392	in academic vernacular.
259.925	Because the first thing is,
259.925	you have to make it sound hard --
262.847	because it is.
264.41	The key thing is, for NBA coaches,
264.41	it's not that they want to know
267.575	whether a pick-and-roll happened or not.
269.521	It's that they want to know
269.521	how it happened.
271.621	And why is it so important to them?
271.621	So here's a little insight.
274.631	It turns out in modern basketball,
276.426	this pick-and-roll is perhaps
276.426	the most important play.
279.065	And knowing how to run it,
279.065	and knowing how to defend it,
281.709	is basically a key to winning
281.709	and losing most games.
284.403	So it turns out that this dance
284.403	has a great many variations
288.228	and identifying the variations
288.228	is really the thing that matters,
291.9	and that's why we need this
291.9	to be really, really good.
295.228	So, here's an example.
296.428	There are two offensive
296.428	and two defensive players,
298.831	getting ready to do
298.831	the pick-and-roll dance.
301.007	So the guy with ball
301.007	can either take, or he can reject.
304.086	His teammate can either roll or pop.
307.111	The guy guarding the ball
307.111	can either go over or under.
310.121	His teammate can either show
310.121	or play up to touch, or play soft
314.71	and together they can
314.71	either switch or blitz
317.352	and I didn't know
317.352	most of these things when I started
320.035	and it would be lovely if everybody moved
320.035	according to those arrows.
323.979	It would make our lives a lot easier,
323.979	but it turns out movement is very messy.
328.047	People wiggle a lot and getting
328.047	these variations identified
333.555	with very high accuracy,
334.882	both in precision and recall, is tough
336.774	because that's what it takes to get
336.774	a professional coach to believe in you.
340.416	And despite all the difficulties
340.416	with the right spatiotemporal features
343.82	we have been able to do that.
345.318	Coaches trust our ability of our machine
345.318	to identify these variations.
349.478	We're at the point where
349.478	almost every single contender
353.035	for an NBA championship this year
354.682	is using our software, which is built
354.682	on a machine that understands
359.114	the moving dots of basketball.
361.872	So not only that, we have given advice
361.872	that has changed strategies
367.049	that have helped teams win
367.049	very important games,
370.425	and it's very exciting because you have
370.425	coaches who've been in the league
374.181	for 30 years that are willing to take
374.181	advice from a machine.
377.874	And it's very exciting,
377.874	it's much more than the pick-and-roll.
380.804	Our computer started out
380.804	with simple things
382.904	and learned more and more complex things
384.992	and now it knows so many things.
386.577	Frankly, I don't understand
386.577	much of what it does,
389.436	and while it's not that special
389.436	to be smarter than me,
393.175	we were wondering,
393.175	can a machine know more than a coach?
396.843	Can it know more than person could know?
398.922	And it turns out the answer is yes.
400.691	The coaches want players
400.691	to take good shots.
403.272	So if I'm standing near the basket
404.947	and there's nobody near me,
404.947	it's a good shot.
407.137	If I'm standing far away surrounded
407.137	by defenders, that's generally a bad shot.
411.101	"But we never knew how good ""good"" was,"
411.101	"or how bad ""bad"" was quantitatively."
416.209	Until now.
417.771	So what we can do, again,
417.771	using spatiotemporal features,
420.853	we looked at every shot.
422.251	We can see: Where is the shot?
422.251	What's the angle to the basket?
425.28	Where are the defenders standing?
425.28	What are their distances?
428.066	What are their angles?
429.421	For multiple defenders, we can look
429.421	at how the player's moving
432.422	and predict the shot type.
433.879	We can look at all their velocities
433.879	and we can build a model that predicts
437.977	what is the likelihood that this shot
437.977	would go in under these circumstances?
442.188	So why is this important?
444.102	We can take something that was shooting,
446.929	which was one thing before,
446.929	and turn it into two things:
449.633	the quality of the shot
449.633	and the quality of the shooter.
453.68	So here's a bubble chart,
453.68	because what's TED without a bubble chart?
456.966	(Laughter)
458.004	Those are NBA players.
459.339	The size is the size of the player
459.339	and the color is the position.
462.483	On the x-axis,
462.483	we have the shot probability.
464.639	People on the left take difficult shots,
466.616	on the right, they take easy shots.
469.194	On the [y-axis] is their shooting ability.
471.275	People who are good are at the top,
471.275	bad at the bottom.
473.861	So for example, if there was a player
475.621	who generally made
477.718	that's all you knew before.
479.345	But today, I can tell you that player
479.345	takes shots that an average NBA player
484.219	would make 49 percent of the time,
486.204	and they are two percent worse.
488.266	And the reason that's important
488.266	is that there are lots of 47s out there.
493.714	And so it's really important to know
496.287	if the 47 that you're considering
496.287	giving 100 million dollars to
500.267	is a good shooter who takes bad shots
503.346	or a bad shooter who takes good shots.
507.13	Machine understanding doesn't just change
507.13	how we look at players,
510.487	it changes how we look at the game.
512.369	So there was this very exciting game
512.369	a couple of years ago, in the NBA finals.
516.148	Miami was down by three,
516.148	there was 20 seconds left.
519.379	They were about to lose the championship.
521.428	A gentleman named LeBron James
521.428	came up and he took a three to tie.
524.793	He missed.
526.015	His teammate Chris Bosh got a rebound,
527.876	passed it to another teammate
527.876	named Ray Allen.
530.059	He sank a three. It went into overtime.
532.002	They won the game.
532.002	They won the championship.
534.122	It was one of the most exciting
534.122	games in basketball.
537.438	And our ability to know
537.438	the shot probability for every player
540.891	at every second,
542.103	and the likelihood of them getting
542.103	a rebound at every second
545.083	can illuminate this moment in a way
545.083	that we never could before.
549.618	Now unfortunately,
549.618	I can't show you that video.
552.31	But for you, we recreated that moment
556.827	at our weekly basketball game
556.827	about 3 weeks ago.
559.279	(Laughter)
561.573	And we recreated the tracking
561.573	that led to the insights.
565.199	So, here is us.
565.199	This is Chinatown in Los Angeles,
569.478	a park we play at every week,
571.066	and that's us recreating
571.066	the Ray Allen moment
573.321	and all the tracking
573.321	that's associated with it.
576.772	So, here's the shot.
578.313	I'm going to show you that moment
580.853	and all the insights of that moment.
583.464	The only difference is, instead
583.464	of the professional players, it's us,
587.218	and instead of a professional
587.218	announcer, it's me.
589.86	So, bear with me.
593.153	Miami.
594.671	Down three.
596.107	Twenty seconds left.
599.385	Jeff brings up the ball.
602.656	Josh catches, puts up a three!
604.631	[Calculating shot probability]
607.278	[Shot quality]
609.048	[Rebound probability]
612.373	Won't go!
613.57	[Rebound probability]
615.777	Rebound, Noel.
617.057	Back to Daria.
618.509	[Shot quality]
622.676	Her three-pointer -- bang!
624.32	Tie game with five seconds left.
626.88	The crowd goes wild.
628.522	(Laughter)
630.205	That's roughly how it happened.
631.776	(Applause)
632.951	Roughly.
634.15	(Applause)
636.121	That moment had about a nine percent
636.121	chance of happening in the NBA
641.629	and we know that
641.629	and a great many other things.
643.914	I'm not going to tell you how many times
643.914	it took us to make that happen.
647.429	(Laughter)
649.2	Okay, I will! It was four.
651.096	(Laughter)
652.121	Way to go, Daria.
653.647	But the important thing about that video
657.934	and the insights we have for every second
657.934	of every NBA game -- it's not that.
662.639	It's the fact you don't have to be
662.639	a professional team to track movement.
667.083	You do not have to be a professional
667.083	player to get insights about movement.
670.764	In fact, it doesn't even have to be about
670.764	sports because we're moving everywhere.
675.654	We're moving in our homes,
681.428	in our offices,
684.238	as we shop and we travel
689.318	throughout our cities
692.065	and around our world.
695.27	What will we know? What will we learn?
697.589	Perhaps, instead of identifying
697.589	pick-and-rolls,
699.918	a machine can identify
699.918	the moment and let me know
702.952	when my daughter takes her first steps.
705.035	Which could literally be happening
705.035	any second now.
708.14	Perhaps we can learn to better use
708.14	our buildings, better plan our cities.
712.362	I believe that with the development
712.362	of the science of moving dots,
716.559	we will move better, we will move smarter,
716.559	we will move forward.
720.607	Thank you very much.
721.82	(Applause)
