12.79	Twenty-three years ago,
15.395	at the age of 19,
18.15	I shot and killed a man.
21.451	I was a young drug dealer
23.594	with a quick temper
25.963	and a semi-automatic pistol.
30.018	But that wasn't the end of my story.
32.789	In fact, it was beginning,
36.93	and the 23 years since
39.105	is a story of acknowledgment,
42.827	apology and atonement.
46.31	But it didn't happen in the way
47.733	that you might imagine or think.
51.027	These things occurred in my life
52.485	in a way that was surprising,
54.628	especially to me.
56.263	See, like many of you,
59.404	growing up, I was an honor roll student,
61.978	a scholarship student,
63.321	with dreams of becoming a doctor.
65.925	But things went dramatically wrong
68.556	when my parents separated
70.73	and eventually divorced.
74.567	The actual events are pretty straightforward.
77.417	At the age of 17,
79.865	I got shot three times
81.51	standing on the corner of my block in Detroit.
86.135	My friend rushed me to the hospital.
88.83	Doctors pulled the bullets out,
92.054	patched me up,
93.845	and sent me back to the same 
93.845	neighborhood where I got shot.
98.216	Throughout this ordeal,
100.971	no one hugged me,
103.031	no one counseled me,
105.401	no one told me I would be okay.
108.341	No one told me that I would live in fear,
111.265	that I would become paranoid,
113.878	or that I would react hyper-violently
116.871	to being shot.
119.249	No one told me that one day,
122.07	I would become the person behind the trigger.
126.127	Fourteen months later,
128.801	at 2 a.m.,
131.411	I fired the shots
133.047	that caused a man's death.
136.9	When I entered prison,
138.81	I was bitter, I was angry, I was hurt.
144.317	I didn't want to take responsibility.
147.287	I blamed everybody from my parents
149.339	to the system.
152.312	I rationalized my decision to shoot
154.524	because in the hood where I come from,
156.963	it's better to be the shooter
158.589	than the person getting shot.
161.901	As I sat in my cold cell,
165.223	I felt helpless,
166.87	unloved and abandoned.
170.257	I felt like nobody cared,
174.135	and I reacted
176.154	with hostility to my confinement.
179.165	And I found myself getting
180.303	deeper and deeper into trouble.
182.618	I ran black market stores,
185.398	I loan sharked,
188.117	and I sold drugs that were illegally smuggled
190.183	into the prison.
192.044	I had in fact become
193.614	what the warden of the Michigan Reformatory called
196.295	"""the worst of the worst."""
199.132	And because of my activity,
201.457	I landed in solitary confinement
204.149	for seven and a half years
206.578	out of my incarceration.
209.79	Now as I see it, solitary confinement
211.459	is one of the most inhumane and barbaric places
213.399	you can find yourself,
216.298	but find myself I did.
219.189	One day, I was pacing my cell,
222.7	when an officer came and delivered mail.
227.217	I looked at a couple of letters
228.954	before I looked at the letter
230.868	that had my son's squiggly handwriting on it.
233.93	And anytime I would get a letter from my son,
235.367	it was like a ray of light
237.272	in the darkest place you can imagine.
240.029	And on this particular day, I opened this letter,
243.844	and in capital letters, he wrote,
246.95	"""My mama told me why you was in prison:"
250.205	"murder."""
252.899	"He said, ""Dad, don't kill."
254.818	"Jesus watches what you do. Pray to Him."""
260.265	Now, I wasn't religious at that time,
262.1	nor am I religious now,
263.807	but it was something so profound
266.291	about my son's words.
269.063	They made me examine things about my life
270.685	that I hadn't considered.
272.621	It was the first time in my life
274.557	that I had actually thought about the fact
276.529	that my son would see me as a murderer.
280.195	I sat back on my bunk
282.249	and I reflected on something I had read
284.268	in [Plato],
286.865	"where Socrates stated in ""Apology"""
288.84	that the unexamined life isn't worth living.
293.111	At that point is when the transformation began.
298.943	But it didn't come easy.
303.92	One of the things I realized,
305.764	which was part of the transformation,
307.921	was that there were four key things.
311.663	The first thing was,
313.97	I had great mentors.
316.283	Now, I know some of you all are probably thinking,
318.159	how did you find a great mentor in prison?
321.328	But in my case,
324.193	some of my mentors
325.423	who are serving life sentences
327.3	were some of the best people
327.3	to ever come into my life,
330.009	because they forced me to look at my life honestly,
333.273	and they forced me to challenge myself
335.098	about my decision making.
337.613	The second thing was literature.
341.867	Prior to going to prison,
343.61	I didn't know that there were so many brilliant
345.607	black poets, authors and philosophers,
348.888	and then I had the great fortune
351.907	of encountering Malcolm X's autobiography,
356.074	and it shattered every
356.074	stereotype I had about myself.
360.621	The third thing was family.
363.062	For 19 years, my father stood by my side
367.738	with an unshakable faith,
370.167	because he believed that I had what it took
371.831	to turn my life around.
374.125	I also met an amazing woman
377.018	who is now the mother of
377.018	my two-year-old son Sekou,
380.452	and she taught me how to love myself
382.68	in a healthy way.
386.958	The final thing was writing.
389.654	When I got that letter from my son,
391.068	I began to write a journal
393.278	about things I had experienced in my childhood
396.079	and in prison,
398.872	and what it did is it opened up my mind to the idea
402.138	of atonement.
405.106	Earlier in my incarceration, I had received
407.188	a letter from one of the relatives of my victim,
410.995	and in that letter,
413.84	she told me she forgave me,
415.685	because she realized I was a young child
417.634	who had been abused
418.971	and had been through some hardships
420.763	and just made a series of poor decisions.
423.501	It was the first time in my life
425.972	that I ever felt open to forgiving myself.
433.701	One of the things that happened
434.945	after that experience is that
437.268	I thought about the other men who were incarcerated
439.156	alongside of me,
440.968	and how much I wanted to share this with them.
443.89	And so I started talking to them about
445.644	some of their experiences,
447.571	and I was devastated to realize
449.053	that most of them came from
449.053	the same abusive environments,
452.431	And most of them wanted help
452.431	and they wanted to turn it around,
455.97	but unfortunately the system
457.71	that currently holds 2.5 million people in prison
460.928	is designed to warehouse
463.128	as opposed to rehabilitate or transform.
467.42	So I made it up in my mind
469.311	that if I was ever released from prison
471.065	that I would do everything in my power
473.522	to help change that.
477.223	In 2010, I walked out of prison
479.989	for the first time after two decades.
483.067	Now imagine, if you will,
484.655	Fred Flintstone walking into an episode
487.237	"of ""The Jetsons."""
489.62	That was pretty much what my life was like.
492.555	For the first time, I was exposed to the Internet,
495.87	social media,
497.606	"cars that talk like KITT from ""Knight Rider."""
501.743	But the thing that fascinated me the most
503.527	was phone technology.
505.31	See, when I went to prison,
506.582	our car phones were this big
508.357	and required two people to carry them.
510.958	So imagine what it was like when I first grabbed
513.046	my little Blackberry
515.172	and I started learning how to text.
517.123	But the thing is, the people around me,
518.79	they didn't realize that I had no idea
520.386	what all these abbreviated texts meant,
523.08	like LOL, OMG, LMAO,
528.11	until one day I was having a conversation
529.852	with one of my friends via text,
532.108	and I asked him to do something,
532.108	"and he responded back, ""K."""
536.139	"And I was like, ""What is K?"""
539.318	"And he was like, ""K is okay."""
541.28	So in my head, I was like,
542.279	"""Well what the hell is wrong with K?"""
545.297	And so I text him a question mark.
547.81	"And he said, ""K = okay."""
551.481	"And so I tap back, ""FU."" (Laughter)"
556.17	And then he texts back, and he asks me
557.926	why was I cussing him out.
559.6	"And I said, ""LOL FU,"""
562.26	as in, I finally understand.
563.959	(Laughter)
565.996	And so fast forward three years,
569.261	I'm doing relatively good.
571.135	I have a fellowship at MIT Media Lab,
573.813	I work for an amazing company called BMe,
577.03	I teach at the University of Michigan,
579.36	but it's been a struggle
581.337	because I realize that there are more
582.8	men and women coming home
584.435	who are not going to be
584.435	afforded those opportunities.
587.596	I've been blessed to work with some amazing
589.401	men and women,
592.085	helping others reenter society,
593.847	and one of them is my friend named Calvin Evans.
598.06	He served 24 years for a crime he didn't commit.
601.015	He's 45 years old. He's currently enrolled in college.
604.783	And one of the things that we talked about
606.507	is the three things that I found important
608.219	in my personal transformation,
609.839	the first being acknowledgment.
611.778	I had to acknowledge that I had hurt others.
614.204	I also had to acknowledge that I had been hurt.
617	The second thing was apologizing.
619.421	I had to apologize to the people I had hurt.
621.571	Even though I had no expectations
621.571	of them accepting it,
623.643	it was important to do because it was the right thing.
626.395	But I also had to apologize to myself.
629.354	The third thing was atoning.
632.171	For me, atoning meant
633.854	going back into my community
635.447	and working with at-risk youth
636.99	who were on the same path,
638.79	but also becoming at one with myself.
642.53	Through my experience of being locked up,
644.294	one of the things I discovered is this:
646.475	the majority of men and women
647.691	who are incarcerated are redeemable,
651.112	and the fact is,
	women who are incarcerated
654.723	will at some point return to the community,
657.411	and we have a role in determining what kind
659.326	of men and women return to our community.
662.945	My wish today
665.556	is that we will embrace
669.209	a more empathetic approach
671.358	toward how we deal with mass incarceration,
674.578	that we will do away with
675.722	the lock-them-up-and-throw-away-the-key mentality,
678.037	because it's proven it doesn't work.
681.96	My journey is a unique journey,
684.413	but it doesn't have to be that way.
687.078	Anybody can have a transformation
689.484	if we create the space for that to happen.
692.324	So what I'm asking today
694.086	is that you envision
695.793	a world where men and women
698.133	aren't held hostage to their pasts,
701.829	where misdeeds and mistakes
703.262	don't define you for the rest of your life.
706.03	I think collectively, we can create that reality,
709.221	and I hope you do too.
710.924	Thank you.
712.69	(Applause)
