12.754	Growing up in Taiwan
14.81	as the daughter of a calligrapher,
16.422	one of my most treasured memories
18.79	was my mother showing me the beauty, the shape
21.883	and the form of Chinese characters.
24.516	Ever since then, I was fascinated
27.023	by this incredible language.
29.685	But to an outsider, it seems to be
32.42	as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China.
35.929	Over the past few years, I've been wondering
38.304	if I can break down this wall,
40.356	so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate
42.95	the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so.
46.858	I started thinking about how a new, fast method
51.17	of learning Chinese might be useful.
54.018	Since the age of five, I started to learn how to draw
58.004	every single stroke for each character
61.009	in the correct sequence.
63.553	I learned new characters every day
65.61	during the course of the next 15 years.
68.337	Since we only have five minutes,
70.457	it's better that we have a fast and simpler way.
74.092	A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters.
77.617	You only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy.
82.729	The top 200 will allow you to comprehend
89.641	enough to read road signs, restaurant menus,
92.517	to understand the basic idea of the web pages
95.521	or the newspapers.
97.46	Today I'm going to start with eight
99.659	to show you how the method works.
101.551	You are ready?
103.472	Open your mouth as wide as possible
106.155	until it's square.
108.201	You get a mouth.
110.883	This is a person going for a walk.
113.971	Person.
117.102	If the shape of the fire is a person
119.811	with two arms on both sides,
122.081	as if she was yelling frantically,
124.251	"""Help! I'm on fire!"" --"
127.804	This symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame,
131.971	but I like to think that way. Whichever works for you.
135.784	This is a tree.
138.043	Tree.
140.141	This is a mountain.
144.566	The sun.
149.458	The moon.
154.112	The symbol of the door
156.087	looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west.
161.793	I call these eight characters radicals.
165.531	They are the building blocks
167.297	for you to create lots more characters.
171.427	A person.
173.165	"If someone walks behind, that is ""to follow."""
177.433	As the old saying goes,
179.561	two is company, three is a crowd.
183.287	If a person stretched their arms wide,
186.202	"this person is saying, ""It was this big."""
190.849	The person inside the mouth, the person is trapped.
194.697	He's a prisoner, just like Jonah inside the whale.
200.543	One tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have the woods.
204.037	Three trees together, we create the forest.
207.593	Put a plank underneath the tree, we have the foundation.
211.665	"Put a mouth on the top of the tree, that's ""idiot."" (Laughter)"
215.8	Easy to remember,
217.881	since a talking tree is pretty idiotic.
222.823	Remember fire?
224.865	Two fires together, I get really hot.
227.526	Three fires together, that's a lot of flames.
230.385	Set the fire underneath the two trees, it's burning.
234.986	For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
238.078	Two suns together, prosperous.
240.257	Three together, that's sparkles.
242.615	Put the sun and the moon shining together,
244.636	it's brightness.
245.944	It also means tomorrow, after a day and a night.
250.169	The sun is coming up above the horizon. Sunrise.
254.652	A door. Put a plank inside the door,
257.755	it's a door bolt.
259.812	Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
262.776	Knock knock. Is anyone home?
266.107	This person is sneaking out of a door,
268.995	escaping, evading.
271.827	On the left, we have a woman.
273.98	Two women together, they have an argument.
276.142	(Laughter)
278.275	Three women together, be careful, it's adultery.
284.793	So we have gone through almost 30 characters.
288.302	By using this method, the first eight radicals
291.639	will allow you to build 32.
293.64	The next group of eight characters
295.403	will build an extra 32.
297.595	So with very little effort,
299.897	you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters,
302.163	which is the same as a Chinese eight-year-old.
304.715	So after we know the characters, we start building phrases.
308.262	For example, the mountain and the fire together,
310.959	we have fire mountain. It's a volcano.
313.887	We know Japan is the land of the rising sun.
317.207	This is a sun placed with the origin,
320.625	because Japan lies to the east of China.
323.752	So a sun, origin together, we build Japan.
327.642	A person behind Japan, what do we get?
330.6	A Japanese person.
333.702	The character on the left is two mountains
336.503	stacked on top of each other.
338.61	In ancient China, that means in exile,
341.827	because Chinese emperors, they put their political enemies
344.265	in exile beyond mountains.
346.636	Nowadays, exile has turned into getting out.
351.647	A mouth which tells you where to get out
354.218	is an exit.
356.146	This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking
359.787	and get off of the stage. Thank you.
361.67	(Applause)
