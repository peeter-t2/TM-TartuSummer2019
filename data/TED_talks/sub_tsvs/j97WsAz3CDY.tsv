12.817	When I was only three or four,
15.285	I fell in love with poetry,
17.777	with the rhythms
17.777	and the music of language;
20.912	with the power of metaphor and of imagery,
24.579	poetry being the essence
24.579	of communication --
27.365	the discipline, the distillation.
30.999	And all these years later,
30.999	the poems I'll read today
33.985	are from my just-finished
33.985	seventh book of poetry.
38.199	Well, five years ago, I was diagnosed
38.199	with Parkinson's disease.
42.874	Though there's no cure yet,
44.818	advances in treatment
44.818	are really impressive.
47.985	But you can imagine
47.985	that I was appalled to learn
50.999	that women are largely
50.999	left out of research trials,
55.517	despite gender-specific
55.517	medical findings having demonstrated
59.062	that we are not actually just small men --
61.746	(Laughter)
63.866	who happen to have
63.866	different reproductive systems.
67.142	Gender-specific medicine
67.142	is good for men, too.
70.325	But you bring to a crisis
70.325	the person you already are,
75.102	including the, yes, momentum
75.102	that you've learned to invoke
78.999	through passionate caring
78.999	and through action,
82.332	both of which require
82.332	but also create energy.
87.47	So as an activist, I began working
87.47	with the Parkinson's Disease Foundation --
91.78	that's pdf.org --
93.985	to create a major initiative to put women
93.985	on the Parkinson's disease map.
101.819	And as a poet, I began working
101.819	with this subject matter,
105.068	finding it tragic, hilarious,
105.068	sometimes even joyful.
110.136	I do not feel diminished by Parkinson's;
112.747	I feel distilled by it,
115.396	and I actually very much
115.396	like the woman I'm distilling into.
121.528	"""No Signs of Struggle"""
124.569	Growing small requires enormity of will:
128.643	just sitting still
128.643	in the doctor's waiting room
131.255	watching the future shuffle in and out,
134.865	watching it stoop; stare at you
137.632	while you try not to look.
140.213	Rare is an exchange:
141.88	a smile of brief, wry recognition.
145.917	You are the new kid on the block.
148.192	Everyone here was you once.
150.791	You are still learning that growing small
150.791	requires a largeness of spirit
155.022	you can't fit into yet:
157.505	acceptance of irritating help
157.505	from those who love you;
161.478	giving way and over, but not up.
165.494	You've swallowed hard the contents
165.494	"of the ""Drink Me"" bottle,"
168.746	and felt yourself shrink.
171.576	Now, familiar furniture looms,
174.343	floors tilt, and doorknobs yield only
174.343	when wrestled round with both hands.
179.685	It demands colossal patience,
179.685	all this growing small:
184.579	your diminished sleep at night,
186.499	your handwriting, your voice, your height.
190.668	You are more the incredible
190.668	shrinking woman
193.917	than the Buddhist mystic,
193.917	serene, making do with less.
197.864	Less is not always more.
201.56	Yet in this emptying space,
201.56	space glimmers,
206.164	becoming visible.
208.115	Here is a place behind the eyes
208.115	of those accustomed
211.498	by what some would call diminishment.
215.468	It is a place of merciless poetry,
219.167	a gift of presence previously ignored,
222.51	drowned in the daily clutter.
225.357	Here every gesture needs intention,
228.462	is alive with consciousness.
230.886	Nothing is automatic.
233.192	You can spot it
233.192	in the provocation of a button,
236.685	an arm poking at a sleeve,
238.922	a balancing act at a night-time curb
238.922	while negotiating the dark.
244.133	Feats of such modest valor,
247.191	who would suspect them to be exercises
247.191	in an intimate, fierce discipline,
252.519	a metaphysics of being relentlessly aware?
256.667	Such understated power here,
259.476	in these tottering dancers
259.476	who exert stupendous effort
263.788	on tasks most view as insignificant.
267.572	Such quiet beauty here, in these,
270.937	my soft-voiced, stiff-limbed people;
275.234	such resolve masked by each placid face.
279.937	There is immensity required
279.937	in growing small,
284.554	so bent on such unbending grace.
288.02	(Applause)
294.343	Thank you.
295.945	This one is called
295.945	"""On Donating My Brain to Science."""
299.152	(Laughter)
301.058	Not a problem.
303.349	Skip over all the pages
303.349	reassuring religious people.
307.28	Already a universal donor:
307.28	kidneys, corneas, liver, lungs,
311.06	tissue, heart, veins, whatever.
314.097	Odd that the modest brain never
314.097	imagined its unique value in research,
319.599	maybe saving someone else from what it is
319.599	they're not quite sure I have.
323.937	Flattering, that.
325.673	So fill in the forms,
327.842	drill through the answers,
329.725	trill out a blithe spirit.
332.021	And slice me, dice me,
332.021	spread me on your slides.
336.703	Find what I'm trying to tell you.
338.994	Earn me, learn me, scan me,
338.994	squint through your lens.
344.015	Uncover what I'd hint at if I could.
346.718	Be my guest, do your best,
346.718	harvest me, track the clues.
351.206	This was a good brain while alive.
353.704	This was a brain that paid its dues.
356.084	So slice me, dice me,
356.084	smear me on your slides,
360.999	stain me, explain me, drain me like a cup.
364.544	Share me, hear me:
366.644	I want to be used
366.644	I want to be used
369.268	I want to be used
369.268	up.
372.395	(Applause)
379.435	(Applause ends)
381.669	"And this one's called ""The Ghost Light."""
386.229	Lit from within is the sole secure way
389.803	to traverse dark matter.
392.424	Some life forms -- certain mushrooms,
392.424	snails, jellyfish, worms --
397.445	glow bioluminescent,
399.741	and people as well;
401.534	we emit infra-red light
401.534	from our most lucent selves.
406.676	Our tragedy is we can't see it.
410.406	We see by reflecting.
412.972	We need biofluorescence
412.972	to show our true colors.
417.4	External illumination can distort, though.
420.527	When gravity bends light,
422.553	huge galaxy clusters
422.553	can act as telescopes,
426.186	elongating background images
426.186	of star systems to faint arcs --
431.387	a lensing effect
432.565	like viewing distant street lamps
432.565	through a glass of wine.
437.535	A glass of wine or two now makes me weave
440.266	as if acting the drunkard's part;
443.152	as if, besotted with unrequited love
446.522	for the dynamic Turner canvasses
446.522	spied out by the Hubble,
450.631	I could lurch down a city street set
452.936	without provoking
452.936	every pedestrian walk-on stare.
457.924	Stare as long as you need to.
460.442	If you think about it, walking,
460.442	even standing, is illogical --
465.865	such tiny things, feet! --
467.865	(Laughter)
469.806	especially when one's body
469.806	is not al dente anymore.
473.741	(Laughter)
477.729	Besides, creature of extremes and excess,
480.875	I've always thought Apollo
480.875	beautiful but boring,
483.935	and a bit of a dumb blonde.
486.771	Dionysians don't do balance.
490.923	Balance, in other words,
490.923	has never been my strong point.
495.104	But I digress.
496.296	More and more these days,
497.535	digression seems
497.535	the most direct route through
500.557	from where I've lost or found myself
502.658	out of place, mind, turn, time.
507.222	Place your foot just so,
507.222	mind how you turn:
511.582	too swift a swivel can bring you down.
515.206	Take your time ushering the audience out,
518.158	saying goodbye to the actors.
521.048	The ghost light
522.223	is what they call the single bulb
524.033	hanging above the bare stage
524.033	in an empty theater.
528.655	In the empty theater of such a night,
530.992	waking to meet no external radiance,
534.834	this is the final struggle left to win,
538.05	this the sole beacon
538.05	to beckon the darkness in
541.309	and let the rest begin,
543.978	this the lens through which at last
543.978	to see both Self and Other
548.955	arrayed with the bright stain
548.955	of original sin:
553.599	lit from within.
556.87	(Applause)
564.725	And this is the last one.
566.639	"""This Dark Hour"""
569.513	Late summer, 4 A.M.
572.674	The rain slows to a stop,
575.044	dripping still from the broad leaves
577.316	of blue hostas unseen
577.316	in the garden's dark.
581.259	Barefoot, careful
581.259	on the slick slate slabs,
584.977	I need no light, I know the way,
588.284	stoop by the mint bed,
590.187	scoop a fistful of moist earth,
593.016	then grope for a chair,
594.748	spread a shawl, and sit,
597.426	breathing in the wet green August air.
602.24	This is the small, still hour
605.254	before the newspaper
605.254	lands in the vestibule like a grenade,
609.092	the phone shrills, the computer screen
609.092	blinks and glares awake.
614.643	There is this hour:
616.847	poem in my head, soil in my hand:
620.847	unnamable fullness.
623.662	This hour, when blood of my blood
626.269	bone of bone, child grown
626.269	to manhood now --
630.325	stranger, intimate,
630.325	not distant but apart --
635.813	lies safe, off dreaming melodies
639.571	while love sleeps, safe, in his arms.
643.735	To have come to this place,
646.364	lived to this moment:
648.479	immeasurable lightness.
651.392	The density of black starts to blur umber.
654.789	Tentative, a cardinal's coloratura,
657.791	then the mourning dove's elegy.
660.39	Sable glimmers toward grey;
662.804	objects emerge, trailing shadows;
665.996	night ages toward day.
668.54	The city stirs.
670.958	There will be other dawns,
670.958	nights, gaudy noons.
675.46	Likely, I'll lose my way.
677.86	There will be stumbling, falling,
680.296	cursing the dark.
682.49	Whatever comes,
684.134	there was this hour when nothing mattered,
688.105	all was unbearably dear.
691.89	And when I'm done with daylights,
694.14	should those who loved me
694.14	grieve too long a while,
699.125	let them remember that I had this hour --
702.378	this dark, perfect hour --
706.01	and smile.
708.418	Thank you.
709.596	(Applause)
