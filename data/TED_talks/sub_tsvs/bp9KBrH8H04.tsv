15.26	As a boy,
17.26	I loved cars.
19.26	When I turned 18,
21.26	I lost my best friend to a car accident.
25.26	Like this.
27.26	And then I decided I'd dedicate my life
30.26	to saving one million people
32.26	every year.
34.26	Now I haven't succeeded, so this is just a progress report,
37.26	but I'm here to tell you a little bit about self-driving cars.
40.26	I saw the concept first
42.26	in the DARPA Grand Challenges
44.26	where the U.S. government issued a prize
46.26	to build a self-driving car that could navigate a desert.
49.26	And even though a hundred teams were there,
52.26	these cars went nowhere.
55.26	So we decided at Stanford to build a different self-driving car.
58.26	We built the hardware and the software.
61.26	We made it learn from us,
63.26	and we set it free in the desert.
66.26	And the unimaginable happened:
68.26	it became the first car
70.26	to ever return from a DARPA Grand Challenge,
72.26	winning Stanford 2 million dollars.
77.26	Yet I still hadn't saved a single life.
80.26	Since, our work has focused
83.26	on building driving cars
85.26	that can drive anywhere by themselves --
88.26	any street in California.
90.26	We've driven 140,000 miles.
93.26	Our cars have sensors
96.26	by which they magically can see
99.26	everything around them
101.26	and make decisions
103.26	about every aspect of driving.
106.26	It's the perfect driving mechanism.
109.26	We've driven in cities,
111.26	like in San Francisco here.
113.26	We've driven from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Highway 1.
117.26	We've encountered joggers,
119.26	busy highways, toll booths,
122.26	and this is without a person in the loop;
124.26	the car just drives itself.
126.26	In fact, while we drove 140,000 miles,
129.26	people didn't even notice.
132.26	Mountain roads,
134.26	day and night,
137.26	and even crooked Lombard Street
140.26	in San Francisco.
142.26	(Laughter)
145.26	Sometimes our cars get so crazy,
148.26	they even do little stunts.
152.26	(Video) Man: Oh, my God.
156.26	What?
158.26	Second Man: It's driving itself.
162.26	Sebastian Thrun: Now I can't get my friend Harold back to life,
165.26	but I can do something for all the people who died.
167.26	Do you know that driving accidents
170.26	are the number one cause of death for young people?
173.26	And do you realize that almost all of those
176.26	are due to human error
179.26	and not machine error,
181.26	and can therefore be prevented by machines?
185.26	Do you realize
187.26	that we could change the capacity of highways
190.26	by a factor of two or three
193.26	if we didn't rely on human precision
195.26	on staying in the lane --
197.26	improve body position
199.26	and therefore drive a little bit closer together
201.26	on a little bit narrower lanes,
203.26	and do away with all traffic jams on highways?
208.26	Do you realize that you, TED users,
211.26	spend an average
213.26	of 52 minutes per day
215.26	in traffic,
217.26	wasting your time
219.26	on your daily commute?
222.26	You could regain this time.
224.26	This is four billion hours
226.26	wasted in this country alone.
229.26	And it's 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted.
233.26	Now I think there's a vision here, a new technology,
236.26	and I'm really looking forward to a time
238.26	when generations after us look back at us
240.26	and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars.
243.26	Thank you.
245.26	(Applause)
