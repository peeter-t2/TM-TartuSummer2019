12.788	Chris Anderson: Welcome
12.788	to this next edition of TED Dialogues.
17.424	We're trying to do
17.424	some bridging here today.
20.514	You know, the American dream
20.514	has inspired millions of people
23.458	around the world for many years.
26.757	Today, I think, you can say
26.757	that America is divided,
32.498	perhaps more than ever,
34.183	and the divisions seem
34.183	to be getting worse.
36.262	It's actually really hard
36.262	for people on different sides
40.127	to even have a conversation.
41.605	People almost feel...
43.941	disgusted with each other.
46.468	Some families can't even speak
46.468	to each other right now.
51.501	Our purpose in this dialogue today
51.501	is to try to do something about that,
56.073	to try to have a different kind
56.073	of conversation,
58.757	to do some listening, some thinking,
58.757	some understanding.
63.022	And I have two people with us
63.022	to help us do that.
66.474	They're not going to come at this
66.474	hammer and tong against each other.
69.737	This is not like cable news.
71.525	This is two people who have both spent
71.525	a lot of their working life
77.042	in the political center
77.042	or right of the center.
79.353	They've immersed themselves
79.353	in conservative worldviews, if you like.
83.341	They know that space very well.
85.488	And we're going to explore together
87.221	how to think about
87.221	what is happening right now,
90.266	and whether we can find new ways to bridge
93.435	and just to have wiser,
93.435	more connected conversations.
96.676	With me, first of all, Gretchen Carlson,
99.803	who has spent a decade
99.803	working at Fox News,
105.117	"hosting ""Fox and Friends"""
105.117	"and then ""The Real Story,"""
109.619	before taking a courageous stance
109.619	in filing sexual harassment claims
115.416	against Roger Ailes,
116.656	which eventually led
116.656	to his departure from Fox News.
120.482	David Brooks, who has earned the wrath
123.309	of many of [The New York Times's]
123.309	left-leaning readers
126.247	because of his conservative views,
129.159	and more recently, perhaps,
129.159	some of the right-leaning readers
132.117	because of his criticism
132.117	of some aspects of Trump.
136.168	Yet, his columns are usually
138.568	the top one, two or three
138.568	most-read content of the day
142.988	because they're brilliant,
144.252	because they bring psychology
144.252	and social science
146.575	to providing understanding
146.575	for what's going on.
150.052	So without further ado, a huge welcome
150.052	to Gretchen and David.
153.349	Come and join me.
154.531	(Applause)
158.268	So, Gretchen.
161.294	Sixty-three million Americans
161.294	voted for Donald Trump.
166.325	Why did they do this?
168.063	Gretchen Carlson: There are a lot
168.063	of reasons, in my mind, why it happened.
171.607	I mean, I think it was a movement
171.607	of sorts, but it started long ago.
174.906	It didn't just happen overnight.
176.738	"""Anger"" would be the first word"
176.738	that I would think of --
179.673	anger with nothing
179.673	being done in Washington,
183.96	anger about not being heard.
187.796	I think there was a huge swath
187.796	of the population
190.215	that feels like Washington
190.215	never listens to them,
192.988	you know, a good part of the middle
192.988	of America, not just the coasts,
197.246	and he was somebody they felt
197.246	was listening to their concerns.
201.976	So I think those two issues
201.976	would be the main reason.
206.226	I have to throw in there also celebrity.
209.212	I think that had a huge impact
209.212	on Donald Trump becoming president.
214.902	CA: Was the anger justified?
217.871	David Brooks: Yeah, I think so.
219.468	In 2015 and early 2016,
219.468	I wrote about 30 columns
223.566	with the following theme:
224.941	don't worry, Donald Trump will never
224.941	be the Republican nominee.
227.952	(Laughter)
229.136	And having done that
229.136	and gotten that so wrong,
231.358	I decided to spend the ensuing year
231.358	just out in Trumpworld,
234.566	and I found a lot of economic dislocation.
237.46	I ran into a woman in West Virginia
237.46	who was going to a funeral for her mom.
241.054	"She said, ""The nice thing about"
241.054	being Catholic is we don't have to speak,
244.546	and that's good,
244.546	"because we're not word people."""
246.842	That phrase rung in my head: word people.
248.848	A lot of us in the TED community
248.848	are word people,
251.648	but if you're not, the economy
251.648	has not been angled toward you,
254.799	and so 11 million men, for example,
254.799	are out of the labor force
258.46	because those jobs are done away.
260.093	A lot of social injury.
261.657	You used to be able to say,
261.657	"""I'm not the richest person in the world,"
264.978	I'm not the most famous,
266.22	but my neighbors can count on me
266.22	"and I get some dignity out of that."""
269.549	And because of celebritification
269.549	or whatever, if you're not rich or famous,
273.127	you feel invisible.
274.309	And a lot of moral injury,
274.309	sense of feeling betrayed,
277.645	and frankly, in this country,
277.645	we almost have one success story,
281.524	which is you go to college, get
281.524	a white-collar job, and you're a success,
285.118	and if you don't fit in that formula,
287.23	you feel like you're not respected.
289.011	And so that accumulation of things --
290.853	and when I talked to Trump
290.853	voters and still do,
293.069	I found most of them completely
293.069	realistic about his failings,
296.778	but they said, this is my shot.
299.154	GC: And yet I predicted
299.154	that he would be the nominee,
302.424	because I've known him for 27 years.
304.632	He's a master marketer,
306.446	and one of the things
306.446	he did extremely well
308.473	that President Obama also did
308.473	extremely well,
310.691	was simplifying the message,
312.753	simplifying down to phrases
315.565	and to a populist message.
317.638	Even if he can't achieve it,
317.638	it sounded good.
321.395	And many people latched on
321.395	to that simplicity again.
324.649	It's something they could grasp onto:
326.618	"""I get that. I want that."
326.618	"That sounds fantastic."""
330.771	And I remember when he used to come
330.771	on my show originally,
333.719	"before ""The Apprentice"""
333.719	"was even ""The Apprentice,"""
336.144	and he'd say it was the number
336.144	one show on TV.
338.347	"I'd say back to him, ""No, it's not."""
340.128	"And he would say, ""Yes it is, Gretchen."""
342.062	"And I would say, ""No it's not."""
343.97	But people at home would see that,
343.97	and they'd be like,
346.529	"""Wow, I should be watching"
346.529	"the number one show on TV."""
349.129	And -- lo and behold -- it became
349.129	the number one show on TV.
352.106	So he had this, I've seen
352.106	this ability in him
355.432	to be the master marketer.
357.654	CA: It's puzzling
357.654	to a lot of people on the left
360.262	that so many women voted for him,
363.545	despite some of his comments.
365.106	GC: I wrote a column
365.106	about this for Time Motto,
367.845	saying that I really believe
367.845	that lot of people put on blinders,
373.144	and maybe for the first time,
376.027	some people decided
376.027	that policies they believed in
378.823	and being heard
378.823	and not being invisible anymore
381.395	was more important to them
383.37	than the way in which he had acted
383.37	or acts as a human.
387.731	And so human dignity --
389.803	whether it would be the dust-up
389.803	about the disabled reporter,
393.295	or what happened
393.295	in that audiotape with Billy Bush
395.859	and the way in which he spoke
395.859	about women --
399.121	they put that aside
401.092	and pretended as if
401.092	they hadn't seen that or heard that,
403.737	because to them,
403.737	policies were more important.
407.797	CA: Right, so just because
407.797	someone voted for Trump,
410.632	it's not blind adherence to everything
410.632	that he's said or stood for.
414.383	GC: No. I heard a lot of people
414.383	that would say to me,
417.229	"""Wow, I just wish he would shut up"
417.229	before the election.
420.316	If he would just stay quiet,
420.316	"he'd get elected."""
423.903	CA: And so, maybe for people on the left
423.903	there's a trap there,
426.864	to sort of despise
426.864	or just be baffled by the support,
432.466	assuming that it's for some
432.466	of the unattractive features.
435.574	Actually, maybe they're supporting
435.574	him despite those,
438.143	because they see something exciting.
439.953	They see a man of action.
441.319	They see the choking hold of government
441.319	being thrown off in some way
446.401	and they're excited by that.
447.764	GC: But don't forget we saw that
447.764	on the left as well -- Bernie Sanders.
451.164	So this is one of the commonalities
451.164	that I think we can talk about today,
455.142	"""The Year of the Outsider,"""
455.142	David -- right?
458.823	And even though Bernie Sanders
458.823	has been in Congress for a long time,
462.112	he was deemed an outsider this time.
464.349	And so there was anger
464.349	on the left as well,
466.715	and so many people were in favor
466.715	of Bernie Sanders.
470.674	So I see it as a commonality.
474.586	People who like Trump,
474.586	people who like Bernie Sanders,
477.189	they were liking different policies,
477.189	but the underpinning was anger.
481.016	CA: David, there's often
481.016	this narrative, then,
485.61	that the sole explanation
485.61	for Trump's victory and his rise
490.825	is his tapping into anger
490.825	in a very visceral way.
495.801	But you've written a bit about
495.801	that it's actually more than that,
500.483	that there's a worldview
500.483	that's being worked on here.
503.705	Could you talk about that?
505.002	DB: I would say he understood what,
505.002	frankly, I didn't,
507.581	which is what debate we were having.
509.461	And so I'd grown up starting with Reagan,
511.918	and it was the big government
511.918	versus small government debate.
514.846	It was Barry Goldwater
514.846	versus George McGovern,
517.059	and that was the debate
517.059	we had been having for a generation.
521.188	It was: Democrats wanted to use
521.188	government to enhance equality,
525.377	Republicans wanted to limit government
525.377	to enhance freedom.
528.149	That was the debate.
529.356	He understood what I think
529.356	the two major parties did not,
532.19	which was that's not the debate anymore.
534.158	The debate is now open versus closed.
536.511	On one side are those who have
536.511	the tailwinds of globalization
539.801	and the meritocracy blowing at their back,
542.058	and they tend to favor open trade,
544.481	open borders, open social mores,
546.49	because there are so many opportunities.
548.476	On the other side are those
548.476	who feel the headwinds of globalization
551.956	and the meritocracy
551.956	just blasting in their faces,
554.372	and they favor closed trade,
554.372	closed borders, closed social mores,
558.327	because they just want some security.
560.442	And so he was right
560.442	on that fundamental issue,
562.61	and people were willing
562.61	to overlook a lot to get there.
565.286	And so he felt that sense of security.
567.417	We're speaking the morning after
567.417	Trump's joint session speech.
571.77	There are three traditional
571.77	groups in the Republican Party.
574.62	There are the foreign policies hawks
576.422	who believe in America
576.422	as global policeman.
578.501	Trump totally repudiated that view.
580.378	Second, there was the social conservatives
582.448	who believed in religious liberty,
584.179	pro-life,
586.116	prayer in schools.
589.53	He totally ignored that.
591.199	There was not a single mention
591.199	of a single social conservative issue.
594.658	And then there were the fiscal hawks,
596.501	the people who wanted to cut down
596.501	on the national debt, Tea Party,
599.643	cut the size of government.
600.973	He's expanding the size of government!
602.852	Here's a man who has single-handedly
602.852	revolutionized a major American party
606.558	because he understood
606.558	where the debate was headed
609.555	before other people.
610.926	And then guys like Steve Bannon come in
612.965	and give him substance to his impulses.
616.027	CA: And so take that a bit further,
617.82	and maybe expand a bit more
617.82	on your insights
621.599	into Steve Bannon's worldview.
623.886	Because he's sometimes tarred
623.886	in very simple terms
626.642	as this dangerous, racist,
626.642	xenophobic, anger-sparking person.
633.277	There's more to the story;
633.277	that is perhaps an unfair simplification.
637.817	DB: I think that part is true,
639.277	but there's another part
639.277	that's probably true, too.
641.771	He's part of a global movement.
643.955	It's like being around Marxists in 1917.
646.664	There's him here, there's the UKIP party,
646.664	there's the National Front in France,
650.884	there's Putin, there's a Turkish version,
650.884	a Philippine version.
653.953	So we have to recognize that this
653.953	is a global intellectual movement.
657.448	And it believes
658.687	that wisdom and virtue is not held
658.687	in individual conversation and civility
663.968	the way a lot of us
663.968	in the enlightenment side of the world do.
667.394	It's held in -- the German word
667.394	"is the ""volk"" -- in the people,"
670.996	in the common, instinctive wisdom
670.996	of the plain people.
674.55	And the essential virtue of that people
674.55	is always being threatened by outsiders.
679.522	And he's got a strategy
679.522	for how to get there.
682.229	He's got a series of policies
682.229	to bring the people up
686.281	and repudiate the outsiders,
688.631	whether those outsiders
688.631	are Islam, Mexicans, the media,
693.424	the coastal elites...
695.318	And there's a whole worldview there;
695.318	it's a very coherent worldview.
698.655	I sort of have more respect for him.
700.578	I loathe what he stands for
700.578	and I think he's wrong on the substance,
703.853	but it's interesting to see someone
703.853	with a set of ideas
706.584	find a vehicle, Donald Trump,
708.581	and then try to take control
708.581	of the White House
711.723	in order to advance his viewpoint.
713.849	CA: So it's almost become, like,
713.849	that the core question of our time now is:
718.699	Can you be patriotic
718.699	but also have a global mindset?
723.744	Are these two things
723.744	implacably opposed to each other?
728.039	I mean, a lot of conservatives
731.524	and, to the extent
731.524	that it's a different category,
733.995	a lot of Trump supporters,
735.3	are infuriated by the coastal elites
735.3	and the globalists
739.25	because they see them
739.25	as, sort of, not cheering for America,
743.26	not embracing fully American values.
745.946	I mean, have you seen that
745.946	in your conversations with people,
749.522	in your understanding of their mindset?
751.45	GC: I do think that there's
751.45	a huge difference between --
754.675	I hate to put people in categories, but,
756.681	Middle America versus
756.681	people who live on the coasts.
760.666	It's an entirely different existence.
762.756	And I grew up in Minnesota, so I have
762.756	an understanding of Middle America,
766.446	and I've never forgotten it.
767.826	And maybe that's why I have
767.826	an understanding of what happened here,
771.357	because those people often feel
771.357	like nobody's listening to them,
776.205	and that we're only concentrating
776.205	on California and New York.
780.717	And so I think that was a huge reason
780.717	why Trump was elected.
785.265	I mean, these people felt like
785.265	they were being heard.
789.377	Whether or not patriotism falls into that,
793.551	I'm not sure about that.
794.744	I do know one thing:
795.939	a lot of things Trump talked about
795.939	last night are not conservative things.
800.018	Had Hillary Clinton gotten up
800.018	and given that speech,
802.519	not one Republican would have
802.519	stood up to applaud.
804.9	I mean, he's talking about spending
804.9	a trillion dollars on infrastructure.
808.551	That is not a conservative viewpoint.
810.413	He talked about government-mandated
810.413	maternity leave.
814.132	A lot of women may love that;
814.132	it's not a conservative viewpoint.
817.174	So it's fascinating
818.349	that people who loved what his message
818.349	was during the campaign,
822.073	I'm not sure -- how do you
822.073	think they'll react to that?
824.699	DB: I should say I grew up
824.699	in Lower Manhattan,
826.909	in the triangle between ABC Carpets,
826.909	the Strand Bookstore
829.664	and The Odeon restaurant.
831.002	(Laughter)
832.657	GC: Come to Minnesota sometime!
834.535	(Laughter)
835.792	CA: You are a card-carrying member
835.792	of the coastal elite, my man.
841.466	But what did you make
841.466	of the speech last night?
843.742	It seemed to be a move
843.742	to a more moderate position,
847.213	on the face of it.
848.388	DB: Yeah, I thought it
848.388	was his best speech,
850.439	and it took away the freakishness of him.
852.501	I do think he's a moral freak,
854.381	and I think he'll be undone by that fact,
857.207	the fact that he just doesn't know
857.207	anything about anything
860.01	and is uncurious about it.
861.287	(Laughter)
862.404	But if you take away these minor flaws,
864.593	I think we got to see him at his best,
866.689	and it was revealing for me
866.689	to see him at his best,
869.831	because to me, it exposed a central
869.831	contradiction that he's got to confront,
874.372	that a lot of what he's doing
874.372	is offering security.
877.4	"So, ""I'm ordering closed borders,"
879.222	I'm going to secure the world
879.222	"for you, for my people."""
882.109	But then if you actually look
882.109	at a lot of his economic policies,
885.181	like health care reform, which is about
885.181	private health care accounts,
888.986	that's not security, that's risk.
891.875	Educational vouchers: that's risk.
891.875	Deregulation: that's risk.
895.595	There's really a contradiction
895.595	between the security of the mindset
899.596	and a lot of the policies,
899.596	which are very risk-oriented.
902.404	And what I would say, especially
902.404	having spent this year,
905.929	the people in rural Minnesota,
905.929	in New Mexico --
909.818	they've got enough risk in their lives.
911.907	And so they're going to say,
911.907	"""No thank you."""
915.246	And I think his health care repeal
915.246	will fail for that reason.
919.038	CA: But despite the criticisms
919.038	you just made of him,
922.007	it does at least seem that he's listening
926.243	to a surprisingly wide range of voices;
928.441	it's not like everyone
928.441	is coming from the same place.
931.236	And maybe that leads to a certain
931.236	amount of chaos and confusion, but --
936.52	GC: I actually don't think he's listening
936.52	to a wide range of voices.
939.766	I think he's listening to very few people.
941.82	That's just my impression of it.
943.647	I believe that some of the things
943.647	he said last night
946.126	had Ivanka all over them.
948.173	So I believe he was listening
948.173	to her before that speech.
952.111	And he was Teleprompter Trump
952.111	last night, as opposed to Twitter Trump.
956.358	And that's why, before we came out here,
958.507	"I said, ""We better check Twitter"
958.507	"to see if anything's changed."""
962.742	And also I think you have to keep in mind
964.955	that because he's such a unique character,
968.162	what was the bar that we
968.162	were expecting last night?
971.031	Was it here or here or here?
973.911	And so he comes out
973.911	and gives a looking political speech,
977.697	"and everyone goes, ""Wow! He can do it."""
981.109	It just depends
981.109	on which direction he goes.
983.155	DB: Yeah, and we're trying
983.155	to build bridges here,
985.544	and especially for an audience
985.544	that may have contempt for Trump,
988.605	it's important to say,
988.605	no, this is a real thing.
990.878	But as I try my best to go an hour
990.878	showing respect for him,
994.756	my thyroid is surging,
996.771	because I think the oddities
996.771	of his character
1000.167	really are condemnatory
1000.167	and are going to doom him.
1002.672	CA: Your reputation is as a conservative.
1008.154	People would you describe you
1008.154	as right of center,
1010.552	and yet here you are
1010.552	with this visceral reaction against him
1014.809	and some of what he stands for.
1016.459	I mean, I'm -- how do you have
1016.459	a conversation?
1020.11	The people who support him,
1020.11	on evidence so far,
1023.063	are probably pretty excited.
1025.279	He's certainly shown real engagement
1030.461	in a lot of what he promised to do,
1032.601	and there is a strong desire
1032.601	to change the system radically.
1036.726	People hate what government has become
1036.726	and how it's left them out.
1040.88	GC: I totally agree with that,
1042.686	but I think that when he was proposing
1042.686	a huge government program last night
1046.377	that we used to call the bad s-word,
1046.377	"""stimulus,"" I find it completely ironic."
1050.469	To spend a trillion dollars
1050.469	on something --
1052.501	that is not a conservative viewpoint.
1054.3	Then again, I don't really believe
1054.3	he's a Republican.
1056.81	DB: And I would say, as someone
1056.81	who identifies as conservative:
1059.855	first of all,
1061.042	to be conservative is to believe
1061.042	in the limitations of politics.
1064.104	"Samuel Johnson said, ""Of all the things"
1064.104	that human hearts endure,
1067.246	how few are those that kings
1067.246	"can cause and cure."""
1069.717	Politics is a limited realm;
1071.386	what matters most
1071.386	is the moral nature of the society.
1074.447	And so I have to think
1074.447	character comes first,
1076.64	and a man who doesn't pass
1076.64	the character threshold
1079.037	cannot be a good president.
1080.401	Second, I'm the kind
1080.401	of conservative who --
1083.09	I harken back to Alexander Hamilton,
1085.801	who was a Latino hip-hop star
1085.801	from the heights --
1088.155	(Laughter)
1092.254	but his definition of America
1092.254	was very future-oriented.
1097.649	He was a poor boy from the islands
1100.029	who had this rapid and amazing
1100.029	rise to success,
1104.366	and he wanted government to give
1104.366	poor boys and girls like him
1107.343	a chance to succeed,
1108.521	using limited but energetic government
1108.521	to create social mobility.
1111.766	For him and for Lincoln
1111.766	and for Teddy Roosevelt,
1115.374	the idea of America
1115.374	was the idea of the future.
1117.733	We may have division and racism
1117.733	and slavery in our past,
1120.648	but we have a common future.
1122.564	The definition of America that Steve
1122.564	Bannon stands for is backwards-looking.
1126.786	It's nostalgic; it's for the past.
1128.757	And that is not traditionally
1128.757	the American identity.
1131.261	That's traditionally, frankly,
1131.261	the Russian identity.
1133.745	That's how they define virtue.
1135.251	And so I think it is a fundamental
1135.251	and foundational betrayal
1138.128	of what conservatism used to stand for.
1140.081	CA: Well, I'd like actually
1140.081	like to hear from you,
1142.453	and if we see some comments coming in
1142.453	from some of you, we'll --
1145.499	oh, well here's one right now.
1146.995	Jeffrey Alan Carnegie: I've tried
1146.995	to convince progressive friends
1150.159	that they need to understand
1150.159	what motivates Trump supporters,
1153.075	yet many of them have given up
1153.075	trying to understand
1155.516	in the face of what they perceive
1155.516	as lies, selfishness and hatred.
1158.684	How would you reach out to such people,
1158.684	the Tea Party of the left,
1161.893	to try to bridge this divide?
1164.898	GC: I actually think
1164.898	there are commonalities in anger,
1168	as I expressed earlier.
1169.462	So I think you can come to the table,
1169.462	both being passionate about something.
1173.916	So at least you care.
1176.255	And I would like to believe --
1176.255	the c-word has also become
1179.986	"a horrible word -- ""compromise,"" right?"
1182.586	So you have the far left
1182.586	and the far right,
1184.681	and compromise -- forget it.
1186.088	Those groups don't want
1186.088	to even think about it.
1188.393	But you have a huge swath
1188.393	of voters, myself included,
1191.507	who are registered independents,
1193.259	like 40 percent of us, right?
1195.251	So there is a huge faction of America
1195.251	that wants to see change
1199.576	and wants to see people come together.
1202.234	It's just that we have to figure out
1204.024	how to do that.
1205.459	CA: So let's talk about that for a minute,
1207.601	because we're having these TED Dialogues,
1207.601	we're trying to bridge.
1210.845	There's a lot of people out there,
1210.845	right now, perhaps especially on the left,
1214.545	who think this is a terrible idea,
1216.36	that actually, the only moral response
1216.36	to the great tyranny
1222.323	that may be about to emerge in America
1226.358	is to resist it at every stage,
1226.358	is to fight it tooth and nail,
1230.014	it's a mistake to try and do this.
1231.919	Just fight!
1233.821	Is there a case for that?
1236.19	"DB: It depends what ""fight"" means."
1236.19	If it means literal fighting, then no.
1239.794	If it means marching, well maybe
1239.794	marching to raise consciousness,
1242.942	that seems fine.
1244.231	But if you want change in this country,
1244.231	we do it through parties and politics.
1248.386	We organize parties, and those parties
1248.386	are big, diverse, messy coalitions,
1253.187	and we engage in politics,
1254.829	and politics is always
1254.829	morally unsatisfying
1257.181	because it's always
1257.181	a bunch of compromises.
1259.682	But politics is essentially
1259.682	a competition between partial truths.
1263.488	The Trump people have a piece
1263.488	of the truth in America.
1266.147	I think Trump himself is the wrong answer
1266.147	to the right question,
1269.284	but they have some truth,
1271.319	and it's truth found in the epidemic
1271.319	of opiates around the country,
1275.492	it's truth found in
1275.492	the spread of loneliness,
1278.508	it's the truth found in people
1278.508	whose lives are inverted.
1281.491	They peaked professionally at age 30,
1283.937	and it's all been downhill since.
1285.986	And so, understanding that
1285.986	doesn't take fighting,
1288.524	it takes conversation and then asking,
1290.499	"""What are we going to replace Trump with?"""
1292.533	GC: But you saw fighting last night,
1292.533	even at the speech,
1295.224	because you saw the Democratic women
1295.224	who came and wore white
1298.116	to honor the suffragette movement.
1299.848	I remember back during the campaign
1301.899	where some Trump supporters wanted
1301.899	to actually get rid of the amendment
1305.412	that allowed us to vote as women.
1307.15	It was like, what?
1309.342	So I don't know if
1309.342	that's the right way to fight.
1311.692	It was interesting,
1311.692	because I was looking in the audience,
1314.524	trying to see Democratic women
1314.524	who didn't wear white.
1317.103	So there's a lot going on there,
1318.677	and there's a lot of ways to fight
1318.677	that are not necessarily doing that.
1325.336	CA: I mean, one of the key
1325.336	questions, to me, is:
1327.834	The people who voted for Trump
1327.834	but, if you like, are more in the center,
1333.507	like they're possibly
1333.507	amenable to persuasion --
1337.113	are they more likely to be persuaded
1337.113	by seeing a passionate uprising
1342.928	"of people saying, ""No, no, no, you can't!"""
1346.465	or will that actually piss them off
1346.465	and push them away?
1350.403	DB: How are any of us persuaded?
1352.075	Am I going to persuade you by saying,
1352.075	"""Well, you're kind of a bigot,"
1355.426	you're supporting bigotry,
1355.426	you're supporting sexism.
1358.391	You're a primitive, fascistic rise
1358.391	"from some authoritarian past""?"
1363.043	That's probably not going to be
1363.043	too persuasive to you.
1365.752	And so the way any of us
1365.752	are persuaded is by:
1368.417	a) some basic show of respect
1368.417	for the point of view, and saying,
1372.783	"""I think this guy is not going"
1372.783	"to get you where you need to go."""
1376.126	And there are two phrases
1376.126	you've heard over and over again,
1379.53	wherever you go in the country.
1381.047	"One, the phrase ""flyover country."""
1382.962	And that's been heard for years,
1384.834	but I would say this year,
1384.834	I heard it almost on an hourly basis,
1388.554	a sense of feeling invisible.
1390.089	And then the sense a sense of the phrase
1390.089	"""political correctness."""
1393.871	"Just that rebellion: ""They're not even"
1393.871	"letting us say what we think."""
1397.974	And I teach at Yale.
1399.323	The narrowing of debate is real.
1404.269	CA: So you would say this is a trap
1404.269	that liberals have fallen into
1407.497	by celebrating causes
1407.497	they really believe in,
1410.617	often expressed through the language
1410.617	"of ""political correctness."""
1414.603	They have done damage.
1414.603	They have pushed people away.
1418.962	DB: I would say
1418.962	a lot of the argument, though,
1421.134	"with ""descent to fascism,"""
1421.134	"""authoritarianism"" --"
1423.519	that just feels over-the-top to people.
1425.732	And listen, I've written
1425.732	eight million anti-Trump columns,
1428.539	but it is a problem, especially
1428.539	for the coastal media,
1431.233	that every time he does something
1431.233	slightly wrong, we go to 11,
1435.43	and we're at 11 every day.
1437.64	And it just strains
1437.64	credibility at some point.
1440.504	CA: Crying wolf a little too loud
1440.504	and a little too early.
1443.254	But there may be a time
1443.254	when we really do have to cry wolf.
1446.145	GC: But see -- one of the most
1446.145	important things to me
1448.741	is how the conservative media
1448.741	handles Trump.
1452.259	Will they call him out
1452.259	when things are not true,
1456.856	or will they just go along with it?
1459.063	To me, that is what is essential
1459.063	in this entire discussion,
1463.116	because when you have
1463.116	followers of somebody
1467.724	who don't really care
1467.724	if he tells the truth or not,
1471.38	that can be very dangerous.
1473.689	So to me, it's: How is the conservative
1473.689	media going to respond to it?
1477.999	I mean, you've been calling them out.
1480.517	But how will other forms
1480.517	of conservative media deal with that
1484.926	as we move forward?
1486.108	DB: It's all shifted, though.
1487.528	The conservative media used to be Fox
1487.528	or Charles Krauthammer or George Will.
1491.19	They're no longer the conservative media.
1493.218	Now there's another whole set
1493.218	of institutions further right,
1496.073	which is Breitbart and Infowars,
1496.073	Alex Jones, Laura Ingraham,
1501.694	and so they're the ones who are now
1501.694	his base, not even so much Fox.
1505.519	CA: My last question for the time being
1505.519	is just on this question of the truth.
1509.63	I mean, it's one of the scariest
1509.63	things to people right now,
1512.533	that there is no agreement,
1512.533	nationally, on what is true.
1516.24	I've never seen anything like it,
1518.054	where facts are so massively disputed.
1521.415	Your whole newspaper, sir,
1521.415	is delivering fake news every day.
1524.99	DB: And failing.
1526.522	(Laughter)
1527.634	CA: And failing. My commiserations.
1529.614	But is there any path
1535.928	whereby we can start to get
1535.928	some kind of consensus,
1539.762	to believe the same things?
1542.646	Can online communities play a role here?
1546.238	How do we fix this?
1547.431	GC: See, I understand how that happened.
1549.493	That's another groundswell kind of emotion
1551.716	that was going on in the middle of America
1553.755	and not being heard,
1555.012	in thinking that the mainstream
1555.012	media was biased.
1558.067	There's a difference, though,
1558.067	between being biased and being fake.
1562.157	To me, that is a very important
1562.157	distinction in this conversation.
1565.754	So let's just say that there was some bias
1565.754	in the mainstream media.
1570.276	OK. So there are ways
1570.276	to try and mend that.
1573.233	But what Trump's doing
1573.233	is nuclearizing that and saying,
1577.332	"""Look, we're just going to call"
1577.332	"all of that fake."""
1579.894	That's where it gets dangerous.
1581.464	CA: Do you think enough of his supporters
1584.349	have a greater loyalty
1584.349	to the truth than to any ...
1588.618	Like, the principle
1588.618	of not supporting something
1593.281	that is demonstrably not true
1595.303	actually matters, so there will be
1595.303	a correction at some point?
1598.288	DB: I think the truth
1598.288	eventually comes out.
1600.602	So for example, Donald Trump
1600.602	has based a lot of his economic policy
1603.782	on this supposition that Americans
1603.782	have lost manufacturing jobs
1606.81	because they've been stolen
1606.81	by the Chinese.
1608.876	That is maybe 13 percent
1608.876	of the jobs that left.
1611.826	The truth is that 87 percent of the jobs
1611.826	were replaced by technology.
1615.432	That is just the truth.
1617.234	And so as a result, when he says,
1619.92	"""I'm going to close TPP"
1619.92	"and all the jobs will come roaring back,"""
1623.911	they will not come roaring back.
1625.496	So that is an actual fact, in my belief.
1628.604	And --
1629.786	(Laughter)
1631.109	GC: But I'm saying what
1631.109	his supporters think is the truth,
1633.849	no matter how many times
1633.849	you might say that,
1636.008	they still believe him.
1637.238	DB: But eventually either jobs
1637.238	will come back or they will not come back,
1641.021	and at that point, either something
1641.021	will work or it doesn't work,
1644.14	and it doesn't work or not work
1644.14	because of great marketing,
1646.959	it works because it actually
1646.959	addresses a real problem
1649.528	and so I happen to think
1649.528	the truth will out.
1652.038	CA: If you've got a question,
1652.038	please raise your hand here.
1656.005	Yael Eisenstat: I'll speak into the box.
1658.649	My name's Yael Eisenstat.
1661.667	I hear a lot of this talk
1663.302	about how we all need to start
1663.302	talking to each other more
1666.005	and understanding each other more,
1667.705	and I've even written about this,
1667.705	published on this subject as well,
1671.269	but now today I keep hearing liberals --
1671.269	yes, I live in New York,
1676.403	I can be considered a liberal --
1678.15	we sit here and self-analyze:
1679.873	What did we do to not understand
1679.873	the Rust Belt?
1682.206	Or: What can we do to understand
1682.206	Middle America better?
1685.08	And what I'd like to know:
1686.552	Have you seen any attempts
1686.552	or conversations from Middle America
1690.502	of what can I do to understand
1690.502	the so-called coastal elites better?
1693.743	Because I'm just offended
1693.743	as being put in a box as a coastal elite
1697.77	as someone in Middle America is
1697.77	as being considered a flyover state
1701.018	and not listened to.
1702.519	CA: There you go, I can hear Facebook
1702.519	cheering as you --
1705.286	(Laughter)
1706.41	DB: I would say -- and this is someone
1706.41	who has been conservative
1709.984	all my adult life --
1711.174	when you grow up conservative,
1712.965	you learn to speak both languages.
1715.626	Because if I'm going to listen to music,
1718.054	I'm not going to listen to Ted Nugent.
1720.196	So a lot of my favorite rock bands
1720.196	are all on the left.
1724.901	If I'm going to go to a school,
1726.463	I'm going probably to school
1726.463	where the culture is liberal.
1729.24	If I'm going to watch a sitcom
1730.871	or a late-night comedy show,
1730.871	it's going to be liberal.
1733.458	If I'm going to read a good newspaper,
1733.458	it'll be the New York Times.
1736.665	As a result, you learn
1736.665	to speak both languages.
1738.955	And that actually, at least
1738.955	for a number of years,
1741.863	when I started at National Review
1741.863	with William F. Buckley,
1744.705	it made us sharper,
1746.209	because we were used to arguing
1746.209	against people every day.
1749.86	The problem now that's happened
1749.86	is you have ghettoization on the right
1753.193	and you can live entirely in rightworld,
1755.578	so as a result, the quality of argument
1755.578	on the right has diminished,
1759.073	because you're not in the other side
1761.64	all the time.
1762.917	But I do think if you're living
1762.917	in Minnesota or Iowa or Arizona,
1767.893	the coastal elites
1767.893	make themselves aware to you,
1770.252	so you know that language as well,
1771.962	but it's not the reverse.
1773.414	CA: But what does Middle America
1773.414	not get about coastal elites?
1777.669	So the critique is,
1780.733	you are not dealing
1780.733	with the real problems.
1783.519	There's a feeling of a snobbishness,
1783.519	an elitism that is very off-putting.
1790.004	What are they missing?
1791.196	If you could plant one piece of truth
1794.723	from the mindset of someone
1794.723	in this room, for example,
1799.937	what would you say to them?
1802.689	DB: Just how insanely wonderful we are.
1804.628	(Laughter)
1806.255	No, I reject the category.
1808.629	The problem with populism
1808.629	is the same problem with elitism.
1812.137	It's just a prejudice on the basis
1814.459	of probably an over-generalized 
1814.459	social class distinction
1817.433	which is too simplistic
1817.433	to apply in reality.
1820.512	Those of us in New York know
1820.512	there are some people in New York
1823.478	who are completely awesome,
1823.478	and some people who are pathetic,
1826.429	and if you live in Iowa, some people
1826.429	are awesome and some people are pathetic.
1830.187	It's not a question
1830.187	of what degree you have
1832.279	or where you happen to live
1832.279	in the country.
1834.351	The distinction is just a crude
1834.351	simplification to arouse political power.
1837.849	GC: But I would encourage people
1837.849	to watch a television news show
1842.458	or read a column
1842.458	that they normally wouldn't.
1846.041	So if you are a Trump supporter,
1846.041	watch the other side for a day,
1851.091	because you need to come out of the bubble
1853.136	if you're ever going
1853.136	to have a conversation.
1855.262	And both sides -- so if you're a liberal,
1857.9	then watch something
1857.9	that's very conservative.
1860.755	Read a column that is not something
1860.755	you would normally read,
1864.427	because then you gain perspective
1864.427	of what the other side is thinking,
1867.741	and to me, that's a start
1867.741	of coming together.
1870.225	I worry about the same thing
1870.225	you worry about, these bubbles.
1873.09	I think if you only watch
1873.09	certain entities,
1875.134	you have no idea what the rest
1875.134	of the world is talking about.
1878.089	DB: I think not only watching,
1880.622	being part of an organization
1880.622	that meets at least once a month
1883.66	that puts you in direct contact
1883.66	with people completely unlike yourself
1887.014	is something we all have
1887.014	a responsibility for.
1889.189	I may get this a little wrong,
1890.68	but I think of the top-selling
1890.68	automotive models in this country,
1893.949	I think the top three or four
1893.949	are all pickup trucks.
1897.295	So ask yourself: How many people
1897.295	do I know who own a pickup truck?
1901.131	And it could be very few or zero
1901.131	for a lot of people.
1904.584	And that's sort of a warning sign
1904.584	kind of a problem.
1907.562	Where can I join a club
1909.335	where I'll have a lot in common
1909.335	with a person who drives a pickup truck
1912.773	because we have a common
1912.773	interest in whatever?
1914.972	CA: And so the internet is definitely
1914.972	contributing to this.
1917.808	A question here from Chris Ajemian:
1919.985	"""How do you feel structure"
1919.985	of communications,
1922.134	especially the prevalence of social
1922.134	media and individualized content,
1925.888	can be used to bring together
1925.888	a political divide,
1928.382	instead of just filing communities
1928.382	"into echo chambers?"""
1931.641	I mean, it looks like Facebook
1931.641	and Google, since the election,
1936.114	are working hard on this question.
1937.817	They're trying to change the algorithms
1941.659	so that they don't amplify fake news
1945.322	to the extent that it happened
1945.322	last time round.
1947.752	Do you see any other
1947.752	promising signs of ...?
1950	GC: ... or amplify one side
1950	of the equation.
1952.127	CA: Exactly.
1953.302	GC: I think that was the constant
1953.302	argument from the right,
1957.691	that social media
1957.691	and the internet in general
1960.285	was putting articles towards the top
1960.285	that were not their worldview.
1964.131	I think, again, that fed into the anger.
1967.097	It fed into the anger of:
1968.656	"""You're pushing something"
1968.656	"that's not what I believe."""
1971.46	But social media has obviously
1971.46	changed everything,
1973.904	and I think Trump is the example
1973.904	of Twitter changing absolutely everything.
1978.305	And from his point of view,
1980.332	he's reaching the American people
1980.332	without a filter,
1984.653	which he believes the media is.
1989.185	CA: Question from the audience.
1992.318	Destiny: Hi. I'm Destiny.
1994.167	I have a question regarding political
1994.167	correctness, and I'm curious:
1998.521	When did political correctness
1998.521	become synonymous with silencing,
2003.215	versus a way that we speak
2003.215	about other people
2008.354	to show them respect
2008.354	and preserve their dignity?
2011.517	GC: Well, I think the conservative media
2011.517	really pounded this issue
2014.929	for the last 10 years.
2016.817	I think that they really, really
2016.817	spent a lot of time
2020.202	talking about political correctness,
2022.032	and how people should have
2022.032	the ability to say what they think.
2025.459	Another reason why Trump
2025.459	became so popular:
2027.653	because he says what he thinks.
2029.555	It also makes me think about the fact
2035.576	that I do believe there are a lot
2035.576	of people in America
2038.635	who agree with Steve Bannon,
2042.551	but they would never say it publicly,
2044.514	and so voting for Trump
2044.514	gave them the opportunity
2047.622	to agree with it silently.
2050.636	DB: On the issue of immigration,
2050.636	it's a legitimate point of view
2055.624	that we have too many immigrants
2055.624	in the country,
2058.075	that it's economically costly.
2059.565	CA: That we have too many --
2060.945	DB: Immigrants in the country,
2060.945	especially from Britain.
2063.578	(Laughter)
2064.776	GC: I kind of like the British accent, OK?
2067.55	CA: I apologize. America, I am sorry.
2069.921	(Laughter)
2071.6	I'll go now.
2073.341	DB: But it became
2073.341	sort of impermissible to say that,
2079.289	because it was a sign that somehow
2079.289	you must be a bigot of some sort.
2082.758	So the political correctness
2082.758	was not only cracking down on speech
2086.733	that we would all find
2086.733	completely offensive,
2088.98	it was cracking down on some speech
2088.98	that was legitimate,
2091.786	and then it was turning speech
2091.786	and thought into action
2096.358	and treating it as a crime,
2098.442	and people getting fired
2098.442	and people thrown out of schools,
2101.386	and there were speech codes written.
2103.152	Now there are these diversity teams,
2104.97	where if you say something
2104.97	that somebody finds offensive,
2107.674	"like, ""Smoking is really dangerous,"""
2107.674	"you can say ""You're insulting my group,"""
2111.394	and the team from the administration
2111.394	will come down into your dorm room
2114.956	and put thought police upon you.
2117.521	And so there has been a genuine narrowing
2117.521	of what is permissible to say.
2122.734	And some of it is legitimate.
2124.626	There are certain words that there
2124.626	should be some social sanction against,
2130.013	but some of it was used
2130.013	to enforce a political agenda.
2133.011	CA: So is that a project
2134.248	you would urge on liberals,
2134.248	if you like -- progressives --
2137.252	to rethink the ground rules
2137.252	around political correctness
2142.193	and accept a little more
2142.193	uncomfortable language
2147.912	in certain circumstances?
2150.77	Can you see that being solved
2152.528	to an extent that others
2152.528	won't be so offended?
2156.755	DB: I mean, most American universities,
2156.755	especially elite universities,
2160.103	are overwhelmingly on the left,
2161.66	and there's just an ease of temptation
2163.546	to use your overwhelming cultural power
2163.546	to try to enforce some sort of thought
2167.763	that you think is right
2167.763	and correct thought.
2170.076	So, be a little more self-suspicious
2170.076	of, are we doing that?
2173.303	And second, my university,
2173.303	the University of Chicago,
2176.803	sent out this letter saying,
2176.803	we will have no safe spaces.
2179.557	There will be no critique
2179.557	of micro-aggression.
2181.991	If you get your feelings hurt,
2181.991	well, welcome to the world of education.
2185.476	I do think that policy --
2186.914	which is being embraced by a lot
2186.914	of people on the left, by the way --
2190.272	is just a corrective to what's happened.
2192.462	CA: So here's a question
2192.462	from Karen Holloway:
2194.595	How do we foster an American culture
2196.949	that's forward-looking, like Hamilton,
2199.497	that expects and deals with change,
2202.049	rather than wanting to have everything
2202.049	go back to some fictional past?
2206.924	That's an easy question, right?
2208.526	GC: Well, I'm still a believer
2208.526	in the American dream,
2211.141	and I think what we can teach
2211.141	our children is the basics,
2214.599	which is that hard work
2218.02	and believing in yourself
2221.417	in America, you can achieve
2221.417	whatever you want.
2223.661	I was told that every single day.
2225.346	When I got in the real world, I was like,
2225.346	wow, that's maybe not always so true.
2229.401	But I still believe in that.
2231.096	Maybe I'm being too optimistic.
2232.693	So I still look towards the future
2232.693	for that to continue.
2236.928	DB: I think you're being too optimistic.
2239.114	GC: You do?
2240.296	DB: The odds of an American young person
2240.296	exceeding their parents' salary --
2244.352	a generation ago, like 86 percent did it.
2246.913	Now 51 percent do it.
2248.696	There's just been a problem
2248.696	in social mobility in the country.
2251.988	CA: You've written that this entire
2251.988	century has basically been a disaster,
2256.841	that the age of sunny growth is over
2256.841	and we're in deep trouble.
2262.498	DB: Yeah, I mean, we averaged,
2262.498	in real terms, population-adjusted,
2266.981	two or three percent growth for 50 years,
2269.125	and now we've had less
2269.125	than one percent growth.
2271.693	And so there's something seeping out.
2274.216	And so if I'm going to tell people
2274.216	that they should take risks,
2278.813	one of the things we're seeing
2278.813	is a rapid decline in mobility,
2281.884	the number of people who are moving
2281.884	across state lines,
2285.277	and that's especially true
2285.277	among millennials.
2288.316	It's young people that are moving less.
2290.23	So how do we give people the security
2290.23	from which they can take risk?
2294.155	And I'm a big believer in attachment
2294.155	theory of raising children,
2297.761	and attachment theory
2297.761	is based on the motto
2300.369	that all of life is a series
2300.369	of daring adventures from a secure base.
2305.399	Have you parents given you a secure base?
2307.796	And as a society,
2307.796	we do not have a secure base,
2310.193	"and we won't get to that ""Hamilton,"""
2310.193	risk-taking, energetic ethos
2314.605	until we can supply a secure base.
2317.086	CA: So I wonder whether
2317.086	there's ground here
2320.509	to create almost like a shared agenda,
2320.509	a bridging conversation,
2325.29	on the one hand recognizing
2325.29	that there is this really deep problem
2330.66	that the system,
2330.66	the economic system that we built,
2333.189	seems to be misfiring right now.
2337.064	Second, that maybe, if you're right
2337.064	that it's not all about immigrants,
2342.458	it's probably more about technology,
2344.44	if you could win that argument,
2346.488	that de-emphasizes what seems to me
2346.488	the single most divisive territory
2351.681	between Trump supporters and others,
2351.681	which is around the role of the other.
2355.759	It's very offensive to people on the left
2355.759	to have the other demonized
2359.833	to the extent that the other
2359.833	seems to be demonized.
2362.562	That feels deeply immoral,
2365.164	and maybe people on the left
2365.164	could agree, as you said,
2368.058	that immigration
2368.058	may have happened too fast,
2370.943	and there is a limit beyond which
2370.943	human societies struggle,
2375.544	but nonetheless this whole problem
2375.544	becomes de-emphasized
2379.657	if automation is the key issue,
2381.816	and then we try to work together
2381.816	on recognizing that it's real,
2384.794	recognizing that the problem
2384.794	probably wasn't properly addressed
2387.947	or seen or heard,
2389.317	and try to figure out
2389.317	how to rebuild communities
2392.65	using, well, using what?
2394.682	That seems to me to become
2394.682	the fertile conversation of the future:
2398.742	How do we rebuild communities
2398.742	in this modern age,
2401.886	with technology doing what it's doing,
2404.242	and reimagine this bright future?
2406.461	GC: That's why I go back to optimism.
2408.588	I'm not being ... it's not like
2408.588	I'm not looking at the facts,
2412.487	where we've come or where we've come from.
2414.949	But for gosh sakes, if we don't look
2414.949	at it from an optimistic point of view --
2418.96	I'm refusing to do that just yet.
2420.688	I'm not raising my 12- and 13-year-old
2420.688	"to say, ""Look, the world is dim."""
2424.926	CA; We're going to have
2424.926	one more question from the room here.
2427.946	Questioner: Hi. Hello. Sorry.
2431.636	You both mentioned
2431.636	the infrastructure plan and Russia
2435.164	and some other things that wouldn't be
2435.164	traditional Republican priorities.
2440.553	What do you think, or when,
2440.553	will Republicans be motivated
2447.146	to take a stand against Trumpism?
2451.559	GC: After last night, not for a while.
2454.506	He changed a lot last night, I believe.
2456.88	DB: His popularity among Republicans --
2456.88	he's got 85 percent approval,
2460.555	which is higher than Reagan
2460.555	had at this time,
2462.799	and that's because society
2462.799	has just gotten more polarized.
2465.739	So people follow the party
2465.739	much more than they used to.
2468.412	So if you're waiting for Paul Ryan
2468.412	and the Republicans in Congress
2471.592	to flake away,
2472.775	it's going to take a little while.
2474.448	GC: But also because they're all
2474.448	concerned about reelection,
2477.954	and Trump has so much power
2477.954	with getting people either for you
2481.673	or against you,
2483.138	and so, they're vacillating
2483.138	every day, probably:
2485.5	"""Well, should I go against"
2485.5	"or should I not?"""
2487.64	But last night, where he finally
2487.64	sounded presidential,
2491.163	I think most Republicans are breathing
2491.163	a sigh of relief today.
2494.919	DB: The half-life of that is short.
2497.233	GC: Right -- I was just going to say,
2497.233	until Twitter happens again.
2500.512	CA: OK, I want to give
2500.512	each of you the chance
2503.604	to imagine you're speaking
2503.604	to -- I don't know --
2507.455	the people online who are watching this,
2509.43	who may be Trump supporters,
2511	who may be on the left,
2511	somewhere in the middle.
2514.649	How would you advise them to bridge
2514.649	or to relate to other people?
2521.468	Can you share any final wisdom on this?
2525.641	Or if you think that they shouldn't,
2525.641	tell them that as well.
2529.439	GC: I would just start by saying
2531.099	that I really think any change
2531.099	and coming together starts from the top,
2535.434	just like any other organization.
2538.534	And I would love if, somehow,
2541.436	Trump supporters or people on the left
2541.436	could encourage their leaders
2546.023	to show that compassion from the top,
2548.599	because imagine the change
2548.599	that we could have
2552.297	if Donald Trump tweeted out today,
2554.449	to all of his supporters,
2556.134	"""Let's not be vile anymore to each other."
2558.818	Let's have more understanding.
2560.516	As a leader, I'm going
2560.516	to be more inclusive
2563.37	"to all of the people of America."""
2566.212	To me, it starts at the top.
2568.329	Is he going to do that? I have no idea.
2571.73	But I think that everything
2571.73	starts from the top,
2574.454	and the power that he has
2576.207	in encouraging his supporters
2579.22	to have an understanding of where
2579.22	people are coming from on the other side.
2584.317	CA: David. DB: Yeah, I guess I would say
2586.84	I don't think we can teach
2586.84	each other to be civil,
2589.606	and give us sermons on civility.
2591.373	That's not going to do it.
2592.641	It's substance and how we act,
2594.349	and the nice thing about Donald Trump
2594.349	is he smashed our categories.
2597.992	All the categories that we thought
2597.992	we were thinking in, they're obsolete.
2602.138	They were great for the 20th century.
2602.138	They're not good for today.
2605.244	He's got an agenda which is about
2605.244	closing borders and closing trade.
2608.499	I just don't think it's going to work.
2610.348	I think if we want to rebuild
2610.348	communities, recreate jobs,
2613.193	we need a different set of agenda
2614.871	that smashes through all our current
2614.871	divisions and our current categories.
2618.466	For me, that agenda is Reaganism
2618.466	on macroeconomic policy,
2622.006	Sweden on welfare policy
2624.2	and cuts across right and left.
2626.426	I think we have to have a dynamic
2626.426	economy that creates growth.
2629.387	That's the Reagan on economic policy.
2631.244	But people have to have that secure base.
2633.233	There have to be
2633.233	nurse-family partnerships;
2635.308	there has to be universal preschool;
2637.11	there have to be charter schools;
2639.129	there have to be college programs
2639.129	with wraparound programs
2642.121	for parents and communities.
2643.626	We need to help heal the crisis
2643.626	of social solidarity in this country
2648.646	and help heal families,
2650.166	and government just has to get
2650.166	a lot more involved
2652.524	in the way liberals like
2652.524	to rebuild communities.
2656.211	At the other hand, we have to have
2656.211	an economy that's free and open
2659.457	the way conservatives used to like.
2661.407	And so getting the substance right
2661.407	is how you smash through
2664.489	the partisan identities,
2665.905	because the substance is what
2665.905	ultimately shapes our polarization.
2670.572	CA: David and Gretchen, thank you so much
2672.565	for an absolutely
2672.565	fascinating conversation.
2674.724	Thank you. That was really,
2674.724	really interesting.
2677.885	(Applause)
2681.232	Hey, let's keep the conversation going.
2685.524	We're continuing to try and figure out
2687.665	whether we can add something here,
2689.325	so keep the conversation
2689.325	going on Facebook.
2691.39	Give us your thoughts from whatever part
2691.39	of the political spectrum you're on,
2695.104	and actually, wherever
2695.104	in the world you are.
2697.189	This is not just about America.
2697.189	It's about the world, too.
2701.296	But we're not going
2701.296	to end today without music,
2703.654	because if we put music
2703.654	in every political conversation,
2708.47	the world would be
2708.47	completely different, frankly.
2710.932	It just would.
2712.734	(Applause)
2715.365	Up in Harlem, this extraordinary woman,
2717.479	Vy Higginsen, who's actually right here --
2719.928	let's get a shot of her.
2721.193	(Applause)
2724.586	She created this program
2724.586	that brings teens together,
2728.893	teaches them the joy
2728.893	and the impact of gospel music,
2732.361	and hundreds of teens have gone
2732.361	through this program.
2736.364	It's transformative for them.
2737.907	The music they made, as you already heard,
2740.119	is extraordinary,
2741.449	and I can't think of a better way
2741.449	of ending this TED Dialogue
2745.847	than welcoming Vy Higginsen's
2745.847	Gospel Choir from Harlem.
2749.678	Thank you.
2750.879	(Applause)
2770.708	(Singing) Choir: O beautiful
2770.708	for spacious skies
2775.366	For amber waves of grain
2780.322	For purple mountain majesties
2785.07	Above the fruited plain
2789.8	America!
2794.469	America!
2799.002	America!
2802.366	America!
2808.138	God shed his grace on thee
2812.814	And crown thy good with brotherhood
2817.253	From sea to shining sea
2831.468	From sea to shining sea
2845.237	(Applause)
