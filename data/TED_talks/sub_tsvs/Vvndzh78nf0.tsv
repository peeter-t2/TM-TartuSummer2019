18.16	♫ Where do we go from here? ♫
22.16	♫ How do we carry on? ♫
25.16	♫ I can't get beyond the questions ♫
32.16	♫ Clambering for the scraps ♫
34.16	♫ in the shatter of us, collapsed ♫
38.16	♫ It cuts me with every could have been ♫
46.16	♫ Pain on pain on play, repeating ♫
50.16	♫ With the backup, makeshift life in waiting ♫
60.16	♫ Everybody says ♫
66.16	♫ time heals everything ♫
72.16	♫ What of the wretched hollow? ♫
78.16	♫ The endless in between? ♫
81.16	♫ Are we just going to wait it out? ♫
84.16	♫ There is nothing to see here now ♫
87.16	♫ Turning the sign around ♫
90.16	♫ We're closed to the Earth 'til further notice ♫
97.16	♫ A crumbling cliche case ♫
100.16	♫ crumpled and puffy faced ♫
103.16	♫ caught dead in the stare of a thousand miles ♫
111.16	♫ All I want, only one street level miracle ♫
117.16	♫ I'll be an out and out born again ♫
119.16	♫ from none more cynical ♫
122.16	♫ Everybody says ♫
128.16	♫ that time heals everything ♫
134.16	♫ But what of the wretched hollow? ♫
140.16	♫ The endless in between? ♫
143.16	♫ Are we just going to wait it out? ♫
147.16	♫ And sit here cold? ♫
150.16	♫ We will be long gone by then ♫
153.16	♫ In lackluster ♫
155.16	♫ In dust we lay around old magazines ♫
159.16	♫ Fluorescent lighting sets the scene ♫
162.16	♫ for all we could and should be being ♫
166.16	♫ in the one life that we've got ♫
173.16	♫ Everybody says ♫
180.16	♫ time heals everything ♫
186.16	♫ And what of the wretched hollow? ♫
192.16	♫ The endless in between? ♫
195.16	♫ Are we just going to wait it out? ♫
202.16	♫ Just going to sweat it out? ♫
208.16	♫ Just going to sweat it out? ♫
216.16	♫ Wait it out ♫
225.16	(Applause)
