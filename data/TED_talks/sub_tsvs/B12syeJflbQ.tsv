13.372	Every day, I listen to harrowing stories
13.372	of people fleeing for their lives,
19.545	across dangerous borders
19.545	and unfriendly seas.
24.109	But there's one story
24.109	that keeps me awake at night,
28.628	and it's about Doaa.
30.208	A Syrian refugee, 19 years old,
33.055	she was living a grinding existence
33.055	in Egypt working day wages.
38.915	Her dad was constantly thinking
38.915	of his thriving business back in Syria
44.326	that had been blown to pieces by a bomb.
48.238	And the war that drove them there
48.238	was still raging in its fourth year.
54.999	And the community
54.999	that once welcomed them there
58.232	had become weary of them.
61.248	And one day, men on motorcycles
61.248	tried to kidnap her.
65.084	Once an aspiring student
65.084	thinking only of her future,
69.857	now she was scared all the time.
74.269	But she was also full of hope,
76.302	because she was in love
76.302	with a fellow Syrian refugee named Bassem.
81.349	Bassem was also struggling in Egypt,
81.349	and he said to Doaa,
86.383	"""Let's go to Europe; seek asylum, safety."
89.773	I will work, you can study --
89.773	"the promise of a new life."""
94.829	And he asked her father
94.829	for her hand in marriage.
98.724	But they knew to get to Europe
98.724	they had to risk their lives,
104.264	traveling across the Mediterranean Sea,
106.788	putting their hands in smugglers',
106.788	notorious for their cruelty.
113.173	And Doaa was terrified of the water.
117.292	She always had been.
117.292	She never learned to swim.
122.222	It was August that year,
122.222	and already 2,000 people had died
126.999	trying to cross the Mediterranean,
128.977	but Doaa knew of a friend who had made it
128.977	all the way to Northern Europe,
132.971	"and she thought, ""Maybe we can, too."""
135.999	So she asked her parents if they could go,
139.025	and after a painful discussion,
139.025	they consented,
142.391	and Bassem paid his entire life savings --
142.391	2,500 dollars each --
148.545	to the smugglers.
150.821	It was a Saturday morning
150.821	when the call came,
154.06	and they were taken by bus to a beach,
154.06	hundreds of people on the beach.
158.873	They were taken then by small boats
158.873	onto an old fishing boat,
169.466	There were Syrians, Palestinians,
169.466	Africans, Muslims and Christians,
	little Sandra, six years old --
179.38	and Masa, 18 months.
183.498	There were families on that boat,
183.498	crammed together shoulder to shoulder,
187.42	feet to feet.
188.976	Doaa was sitting with her legs
188.976	crammed up to her chest,
192.808	Bassem holding her hand.
196.386	Day two on the water,
196.386	they were sick with worry
199.117	and sick to their stomachs
199.117	from the rough sea.
203.109	Day three, Doaa had a premonition.
207.068	And she said to Bassem,
207.068	"""I fear we're not going to make it."
211.645	"I fear the boat is going to sink."""
214.517	And Bassem said to her,
214.517	"""Please be patient."
217.69	We will make it to Sweden,
217.69	we will get married
220.896	"and we will have a future."""
223.751	Day four, the passengers
223.751	were getting agitated.
227.628	They asked the captain,
227.628	"""When will we get there?"""
230.788	He told them to shut up,
230.788	and he insulted them.
234.74	"He said, ""In 16 hours we will reach"
234.74	"the shores of Italy."""
238.506	They were weak and weary.
241.704	Soon they saw a boat approach --
241.704	a smaller boat, 10 men on board,
245.999	who started shouting at them,
245.999	hurling insults,
249.438	throwing sticks, asking them
249.438	to all disembark
253.812	and get on this smaller,
253.812	more unseaworthy boat.
257.551	The parents were terrified
257.551	for their children,
261.093	and they collectively
261.093	refused to disembark.
266.157	So the boat sped away in anger,
269.297	and a half an hour later, came back
273.551	and started deliberately ramming a hole
273.551	in the side of Doaa's boat,
279.627	just below where she
279.627	and Bassem were sitting.
283.764	And she heard how they yelled,
287.127	"""Let the fish eat your flesh!"""
291.599	And they started laughing
291.599	as the boat capsized and sank.
297.999	The 300 people below deck were doomed.
301.757	Doaa was holding on to the side
301.757	of the boat as it sank,
306.37	and watched in horror as a small child
306.37	was cut to pieces by the propeller.
314.355	"Bassem said to her, ""Please let go,"
316.578	or you'll be swept in and the propeller
316.578	"will kill you, too."""
320.267	And remember -- she can't swim.
322.999	But she let go and she started moving
322.999	her arms and her legs,
327.211	"thinking, ""This is swimming."""
328.671	And miraculously,
328.671	Bassem found a life ring.
333.806	It was one of those child's rings
335.878	that they use to play
335.878	in swimming pools and on calm seas.
339.999	And Doaa climbed onto the ring,
342.068	her arms and her legs
342.068	dangling by the side.
346.835	Bassem was a good swimmer,
348.8	so he held her hand and tread water.
354.064	Around them there were corpses.
356.026	Around 100 people survived initially,
358.518	and they started coming together
358.518	in groups, praying for rescue.
363.083	But when a day went by and no one came,
367.424	some people gave up hope,
369.273	and Doaa and Bassem watched
371.471	as men in the distance took their
371.471	life vests off and sank into the water.
379.052	One man approached them
379.052	with a small baby perched on his shoulder,
384.999	nine months old -- Malek.
386.673	He was holding onto a gas canister
386.673	to stay afloat, and he said to them,
391.776	"""I fear I am not going to survive."
393.75	I'm too weak. I don't have
393.75	"the courage anymore."""
396.829	And he handed little Malek
396.829	over to Bassem and to Doaa,
401.999	and they perched her onto the life ring.
405.774	So now they were three,
405.774	Doaa, Bassem and little Malek.
411.212	And let me take a pause
411.212	in this story right here
414.365	and ask the question:
416.687	why do refugees like Doaa
416.687	take these kinds of risks?
423.061	Millions of refugees are living
423.061	in exile, in limbo.
429.232	They're living in countries [fleeing]
429.232	from a war that has been raging
433.556	for four years.
437.634	Even if they wanted to return, they can't.
440.819	Their homes, their businesses,
443.605	their towns and their cities
443.605	have been completely destroyed.
447.151	This is a UNESCO World Heritage City,
449.999	Homs, in Syria.
453.097	So people continue to flee
453.097	into neighboring countries,
457.686	and we build refugee camps
457.686	for them in the desert.
461.309	Hundreds of thousands of people
461.309	live in camps like these,
465.343	and thousands and thousands more,
465.343	millions, live in towns and cities.
470.34	And the communities,
471.582	the neighboring countries
471.582	that once welcomed them
474.462	with open arms and hearts
476.248	are overwhelmed.
478.731	There are simply not enough schools,
478.731	water systems, sanitation.
483.747	Even rich European countries
483.747	could never handle such an influx
488.394	without massive investment.
493.407	The Syria war has driven almost
493.407	four million people over the borders,
498.457	but over seven million people
498.457	are on the run inside the country.
503.418	That means that over half
503.418	the Syrian population
507.133	has been forced to flee.
509.766	Back to those neighboring
509.766	countries hosting so many.
515.114	They feel that the richer world
515.114	has done too little to support them.
521.401	And days have turned into months,
521.401	months into years.
526.483	A refugee's stay is supposed
526.483	to be temporary.
530.079	Back to Doaa and Bassem in the water.
533.424	It was their second day,
533.424	and Bassem was getting very weak.
538.764	And now it was Doaa's turn
538.764	to say to Bassem,
542.789	"""My love, please hold on to hope,"
542.789	"to our future. We will make it."""
549.376	And he said to her,
552.081	"""I'm sorry, my love,"
552.081	that I put you in this situation.
556.542	I have never loved anyone
556.542	"as much as I love you."""
562.871	And he released himself into the water,
566.293	and Doaa watched as the love of her life
566.293	drowned before her eyes.
575.888	Later that day,
578.328	a mother came up to Doaa with her
578.328	small 18-month-old daughter, Masa.
584.741	This was the little girl I showed you
584.741	in the picture earlier,
587.69	with the life vests.
589.562	Her older sister Sandra had just drowned,
591.779	and her mother knew she had to do
591.779	everything in her power
595.922	to save her daughter.
597.993	And she said to Doaa,
597.993	"""Please take this child."
601.874	Let her be part of you.
601.874	"I will not survive."""
607.125	And then she went away and drowned.
611.825	So Doaa, the 19-year-old refugee
611.825	who was terrified of the water,
616.083	who couldn't swim,
617.999	found herself in charge
617.999	of two little baby kids.
623.615	And they were thirsty and they were hungry
623.615	and they were agitated,
627.32	and she tried her best to amuse them,
630.042	to sing to them, to say words
630.042	to them from the Quran.
635.234	Around them, the bodies were bloating
635.234	and turning black.
639.692	The sun was blazing during the day.
641.462	At night, there was a cold moon and fog.
644.206	It was very frightening.
646.976	On the fourth day in the water,
646.976	this is how Doaa probably looked
651.739	on the ring with her two children.
653.884	A woman came on the fourth day
653.884	and approached her
657.455	and asked her to take another child --
660.59	a little boy, just four years old.
664.999	When Doaa took the little boy
664.999	and the mother drowned,
669.04	she said to the sobbing child,
671.024	"""She just went away"
671.024	"to find you water and food."""
676.388	But his heart soon stopped,
678.405	and Doaa had to release
678.405	the little boy into the water.
683.023	Later that day,
685.072	she looked up into the sky with hope,
688.375	because she saw two planes
688.375	crossing in the sky.
692.414	And she waved her arms,
692.414	hoping they would see her,
696.937	but the planes were soon gone.
699.317	But that afternoon,
699.317	as the sun was going down,
702.244	she saw a boat, a merchant vessel.
706.109	"And she said, ""Please, God,"
706.109	"let them rescue me."""
710.15	She waved her arms and she felt
710.15	like she shouted for about two hours.
714.134	And it had become dark,
714.134	but finally the searchlights found her
718.768	and they extended a rope,
720.999	astonished to see a woman
720.999	clutching onto two babies.
726.77	They pulled them onto the boat,
726.77	they got oxygen and blankets,
730.282	and a Greek helicopter came
730.282	to pick them up
733.313	and take them to the island of Crete.
736.353	But Doaa looked down and asked,
736.353	"""What of Malek?"""
740.4	And they told her the little baby
740.4	did not survive --
743.999	she drew her last breath
743.999	in the boat's clinic.
748.203	But Doaa was sure that as they had
748.203	been pulled up onto the rescue boat,
753.999	that little baby girl had been smiling.
759.278	Only 11 people survived
759.278	that wreck, of the 500.
766.304	There was never an international
766.304	investigation into what happened.
770.999	There were some media reports
770.999	about mass murder at sea,
775.118	a terrible tragedy,
776.467	but that was only for one day.
779.49	And then the news cycle moved on.
784.536	Meanwhile, in a pediatric
784.536	hospital on Crete,
789.102	little Masa was on the edge of death.
793.681	She was really dehydrated.
793.681	Her kidneys were failing.
797.415	Her glucose levels were dangerously low.
799.463	The doctors did everything
799.463	in their medical power to save them,
803.053	and the Greek nurses never left her side,
806.737	holding her, hugging her,
806.737	singing her words.
808.888	My colleagues also visited
808.888	and said pretty words to her in Arabic.
814.481	Amazingly, little Masa survived.
820.192	And soon the Greek press started reporting
820.192	about the miracle baby,
826.152	who had survived four days in the water
826.152	without food or anything to drink,
831.843	and offers to adopt her came
831.843	from all over the country.
837.466	And meanwhile, Doaa
837.466	was in another hospital on Crete,
840.88	thin, dehydrated.
843.571	An Egyptian family took her into their
843.571	home as soon as she was released.
850.248	And soon word went around
850.248	about Doaa's survival,
855.019	and a phone number
855.019	was published on Facebook.
859.3	Messages started coming in.
862.999	"""Doaa, do you know"
862.999	what happened to my brother?
867.811	My sister? My parents? My friends?
867.811	"Do you know if they survived?"""
875.201	One of those messages said,
878.999	"""I believe you saved"
878.999	"my little niece, Masa."""
884.249	And it had this photo.
887.741	This was from Masa's uncle,
890.027	a Syrian refugee who had made it
890.027	to Sweden with his family
894.773	and also Masa's older sister.
897.647	Soon, we hope, Masa will be reunited
897.647	with him in Sweden,
903.355	and until then, she's being cared for
903.355	in a beautiful orphanage in Athens.
910.221	And Doaa? Well, word went around
910.221	about her survival, too.
916.999	And the media wrote
916.999	about this slight woman,
920.736	and couldn't imagine how
920.736	she could survive all this time
924.672	under such conditions in that sea,
927.69	and still save another life.
932.459	The Academy of Athens, one of Greece's
932.459	most prestigious institutions,
937.87	gave her an award of bravery,
941.25	and she deserves all that praise,
944.265	and she deserves a second chance.
947.999	But she wants to still go to Sweden.
951.463	She wants to reunite
951.463	with her family there.
953.717	She wants to bring her mother
953.717	and her father and her younger siblings
957.852	away from Egypt there as well,
960.194	and I believe she will succeed.
963.399	She wants to become a lawyer
963.399	or a politician
966.145	or something that can help
966.145	fight injustice.
971.063	She is an extraordinary survivor.
975.215	But I have to ask:
977.803	what if she didn't have to take that risk?
980.099	Why did she have to go through all that?
983.226	Why wasn't there a legal way
983.226	for her to study in Europe?
988.314	Why couldn't Masa have taken
988.314	an airplane to Sweden?
992.634	Why couldn't Bassem have found work?
996.125	Why is there no massive resettlement
996.125	program for Syrian refugees,
1001.571	the victims of the worst war of our times?
1005.778	The world did this for the Vietnamese
1005.778	in the 1970s. Why not now?
1012.624	Why is there so little investment
1012.624	in the neighboring countries
1017.265	hosting so many refugees?
1021.113	And why, the root question,
1023.999	is so little being done to stop
1023.999	the wars, the persecution
1030.419	and the poverty that is driving
1030.419	so many people
1034.999	to the shores of Europe?
1037.999	Until these issues are resolved,
1040.632	people will continue to take to the seas
1043.991	and to seek safety and asylum.
1048.103	And what happens next?
1050.253	Well, that is largely Europe's choice.
1053.108	And I understand the public fears.
1057.005	People are worried about their security,
1057.005	their economies, the changes of culture.
1063.893	But is that more important
1063.893	than saving human lives?
1068.859	Because there is something
1068.859	fundamental here
1071.662	that I think overrides the rest,
1074.49	and it is about our common humanity.
1078.719	No person fleeing war or persecution
1083.212	should have to die
1083.212	crossing a sea to reach safety.
1088.397	(Applause)
1094.753	One thing is for sure,
1095.944	that no refugee would be
1095.944	on those dangerous boats
1099.151	if they could thrive where they are.
1101.523	And no migrant would take
1101.523	that dangerous journey
1104.825	if they had enough food
1104.825	for themselves and their children.
1108.735	And no one would put their life savings
1111.378	in the hands of those notorious smugglers
1114.195	if there was a legal way to migrate.
1117.471	So on behalf of little Masa
1121.09	and on behalf of Doaa
1123.383	and of Bassem
1125.131	and of those 500 people
1125.131	who drowned with them,
1130.292	can we make sure that they
1130.292	did not die in vain?
1134.308	Could we be inspired by what happened,
1137.999	and take a stand for a world
1137.999	in which every life matters?
1144.999	Thank you.
1146.334	(Applause)
