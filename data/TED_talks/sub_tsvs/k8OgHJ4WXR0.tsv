12.96	I'm here to tell you
12.96	about the real search for alien life.
16.675	Not little green humanoids
16.675	arriving in shiny UFOs,
19.93	although that would be nice.
21.678	But it's the search for planets
21.678	orbiting stars far away.
25.924	Every star in our sky is a sun.
27.783	And if our sun has planets --
29.188	Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, etc.,
31.709	surely those other stars
31.709	should have planets also,
34.169	and they do.
35.455	And in the last two decades,
36.891	astronomers have found
36.891	thousands of exoplanets.
40.502	Our night sky is literally
40.502	teeming with exoplanets.
43.337	We know, statistically speaking,
44.913	that every star has at least one planet.
47.984	And in the search for planets,
49.985	and in the future,
49.985	planets that might be like Earth,
52.775	we're able to help address
54.168	some of the most amazing
54.168	and mysterious questions
57.041	that have faced humankind for centuries.
59.636	Why are we here?
61.215	Why does our universe exist?
63.476	How did Earth form and evolve?
65.912	How and why did life originate
65.912	and populate our planet?
69.665	The second question
69.665	that we often think about is:
72.744	Are we alone?
74.911	Is there life out there?
77.109	Who is out there?
79.783	You know, this question has been around
79.783	for thousands of years,
82.813	since at least the time
82.813	of the Greek philosophers.
85.254	But I'm here to tell you
85.254	just how close we're getting
87.825	to finding out the answer
87.825	to this question.
90.73	It's the first time in human history
90.73	that this really is within reach for us.
95.294	Now when I think about the possibilities
95.294	for life out there,
98.297	I think of the fact that our sun
98.297	is but one of many stars.
102.825	This is a photograph of a real galaxy,
104.727	we think our Milky Way
104.727	looks like this galaxy.
107.197	It's a collection of bound stars.
108.86	But our [sun] is one
108.86	of hundreds of billions of stars
113.271	and our galaxy is one of upwards
113.271	of hundreds of billions of galaxies.
118.707	Knowing that small planets
118.707	are very common,
121.498	you can just do the math.
123.424	And there are just so many stars
123.424	and so many planets out there,
127.449	that surely, there must be life
127.449	somewhere out there.
131.06	Well, the biologists get furious
131.06	with me for saying that,
134.504	because we have absolutely no evidence
134.504	for life beyond Earth yet.
138.977	Well, if we were able to look
138.977	at our galaxy from the outside
143.794	and zoom in to where our sun is,
146.026	we see a real map of the stars.
148.046	And the highlighted stars
148.046	are those with known exoplanets.
151.745	This is really just
151.745	the tip of the iceberg.
154.642	Here, this animation is zooming in
154.642	onto our solar system.
158.872	And you'll see here the planets
160.381	as well as some spacecraft
160.381	that are also orbiting our sun.
164.968	Now if we can imagine going
164.968	to the West Coast of North America,
168.356	and looking out at the night sky,
170.506	here's what we'd see on a spring night.
172.808	And you can see
172.808	the constellations overlaid
174.842	and again, so many stars with planets.
177.135	There's a special patch of the sky
177.135	where we have thousands of planets.
181.353	This is where the Kepler Space Telescope
181.353	focused for many years.
185.576	Let's zoom in and look
185.576	at one of the favorite exoplanets.
190.863	This star is called Kepler-186f.
194.529	It's a system of about five planets.
196.751	And by the way, most of these exoplanets,
196.751	we don't know too much about.
200.6	We know their size, and their orbit
200.6	and things like that.
203.607	But there's a very special planet
203.607	here called Kepler-186f.
207.593	This planet is in a zone
207.593	that is not too far from the star,
211.721	so that the temperature
211.721	may be just right for life.
215.004	Here, the artist's conception
215.004	is just zooming in
218.059	and showing you what that planet
218.059	might be like.
223.074	So, many people have this
223.074	romantic notion of astronomers
228.7	going to the telescope
228.7	on a lonely mountaintop
232.28	and looking at the spectacular night sky
232.28	through a big telescope.
235.853	But actually, we just work
235.853	on our computers like everyone else,
239.249	and we get our data by email
239.249	or downloading from a database.
243.098	So instead of coming here to tell you
245.645	about the somewhat tedious nature
245.645	of the data and data analysis
248.8	and the complex computer models we make,
250.89	I have a different way
250.89	to try to explain to you
253.112	some of the things
253.112	that we're thinking about exoplanets.
255.781	Here's a travel poster:
256.971	"""Kepler-186f:"
259.315	Where the grass is always redder
259.315	"on the other side."""
262.053	That's because Kepler-186f
262.053	orbits a red star,
265.807	and we're just speculating
265.807	that perhaps the plants there,
268.523	if there is vegetation
268.523	that does photosynthesis,
271.165	it has different pigments and looks red.
274.137	"""Enjoy the gravity on HD 40307g,"
278.519	"a Super-Earth."""
280.002	This planet is more massive than Earth
282.183	and has a higher surface gravity.
284.333	"""Relax on Kepler-16b,"
287.254	"where your shadow always has company."""
289.174	(Laughter)
291.158	We know of a dozen planets
291.158	that orbit two stars,
295.364	and there's likely many more out there.
297.507	If we could visit one of those planets,
299.492	you literally would see two sunsets
301.403	and have two shadows.
303.484	So actually, science fiction
303.484	got some things right.
305.925	Tatooine from Star Wars.
308.047	And I have a couple of other
308.047	favorite exoplanets
310.366	to tell you about.
311.587	This one is Kepler-10b,
313.143	it's a hot, hot planet.
315.642	It orbits over 50 times closer to its star
318.601	than our Earth does to our sun.
320.792	And actually, it's so hot,
322.396	we can't visit any
322.396	of these planets, but if we could,
325.053	we would melt long before we got there.
327.051	We think the surface
327.051	is hot enough to melt rock
329.404	and has liquid lava lakes.
331.457	Gliese 1214b.
333.065	This planet, we know the mass and the size
335.188	and it has a fairly low density.
336.8	It's somewhat warm.
338.053	We actually don't know
338.053	really anything about this planet,
340.761	but one possibility
340.761	is that it's a water world,
343.29	like a scaled-up version
343.29	of one of Jupiter's icy moons
346.821	that might be 50 percent water by mass.
349.328	And in this case, it would have
349.328	a thick steam atmosphere
352.313	overlaying an ocean,
354.193	not of liquid water,
355.727	but of an exotic form
355.727	of water, a superfluid --
358.756	not quite a gas, not quite a liquid.
360.77	And under that wouldn't be rock,
362.394	but a form of high-pressure ice,
364.014	like ice IX.
366.593	So out of all these planets out there,
368.792	and the variety
368.792	is just simply astonishing,
372.03	we mostly want to find the planets
372.03	that are Goldilocks planets, we call them.
377.184	Not too big, not too small,
379.125	not too hot, not too cold --
380.996	but just right for life.
382.658	But to do that,
382.658	we'd have to be able to look
384.8	at the planet's atmosphere,
386.158	because the atmosphere
386.158	acts like a blanket trapping heat --
388.978	the greenhouse effect.
390.338	We have to be able to assess
390.338	the greenhouse gases
393.182	on other planets.
395.169	Well, science fiction
395.169	got some things wrong.
397.796	The Star Trek Enterprise
399.21	had to travel vast distances
399.21	at incredible speeds
402.861	to orbit other planets
404.614	so that First Officer Spock
404.614	could analyze the atmosphere
408.614	to see if the planet was habitable
410.599	or if there were lifeforms there.
412.745	Well, we don't need
412.745	to travel at warp speeds
415.259	to see other planet atmospheres,
417.412	although I don't want to dissuade
417.412	any budding engineers
420.22	from figuring out how to do that.
422.167	We actually can and do study
422.167	planet atmospheres
424.483	from here, from Earth orbit.
426.12	This is a picture, a photograph
426.12	of the Hubble Space Telescope
429.321	taken by the shuttle Atlantis
429.321	as it was departing
432.095	after the last
432.095	human space flight to Hubble.
434.358	They installed a new camera, actually,
436.268	that we use for exoplanet atmospheres.
438.437	And so far, we've been able to study
438.437	dozens of exoplanet atmospheres,
443.366	about six of them in great detail.
445.514	But those are not
445.514	small planets like Earth.
447.71	They're big, hot planets
447.71	that are easy to see.
450.128	We're not ready,
451.39	we don't have the right technology yet
451.39	to study small exoplanets.
456.106	But nevertheless,
457.288	I wanted to try to explain to you
457.288	how we study exoplanet atmospheres.
461.652	I want you to imagine,
461.652	for a moment, a rainbow.
464.532	And if we could look
464.532	at this rainbow closely,
467.302	we would see that some
467.302	dark lines are missing.
471.127	And here's our sun,
472.572	the white light of our sun split up,
474.363	not by raindrops, but by a spectrograph.
476.673	And you can see
476.673	all these dark, vertical lines.
479.148	Some are very narrow, some are wide,
480.982	some are shaded at the edges.
482.431	And this is actually how astronomers
482.431	have studied objects in the heavens,
486.059	literally, for over a century.
487.578	So here, each different atom and molecule
490.028	has a special set of lines,
491.577	a fingerprint, if you will.
493.157	And that's how we study
493.157	exoplanet atmospheres.
495.918	And I'll just never forget
495.918	when I started working
498.302	on exoplanet atmospheres 20 years ago,
500.182	how many people told me,
501.391	"""This will never happen."
502.624	We'll never be able to study them.
502.624	"Why are you bothering?"""
505.438	And that's why I'm pleased to tell you
505.438	about all the atmospheres studied now,
509.136	and this is really a field of its own.
511.009	So when it comes to
511.009	other planets, other Earths,
513.555	in the future when we can observe them,
515.656	what kind of gases
515.656	would we be looking for?
518.144	Well, you know, our own Earth
518.144	has oxygen in the atmosphere
521.343	to 20 percent by volume.
523.445	That's a lot of oxygen.
525.457	But without plants
525.457	and photosynthetic life,
528.226	there would be no oxygen,
529.66	virtually no oxygen in our atmosphere.
532.116	So oxygen is here because of life.
534.063	And our goal then is to look for gases
534.063	in other planet atmospheres,
538.194	gases that don't belong,
540.255	that we might be able
540.255	to attribute to life.
542.662	But which molecules should we search for?
544.767	I actually told you
544.767	how diverse exoplanets are.
547.454	We expect that to continue in the future
549.475	when we find other Earths.
550.8	And that's one of the main things
550.8	I'm working on now,
553.396	I have a theory about this.
554.713	It reminds me that nearly every day,
557.025	I receive an email or emails
559.701	from someone with a crazy theory
559.701	about physics of gravity
563.352	or cosmology or some such.
565.208	So, please don't email me
565.208	one of your crazy theories.
568.565	(Laughter)
569.803	Well, I had my own crazy theory.
572.005	But, who does the MIT professor go to?
574.703	Well, I emailed a Nobel Laureate
574.703	in Physiology or Medicine
578.938	"and he said, ""Sure, come and talk to me."""
580.935	So I brought my two biochemistry friends
582.958	and we went to talk to him
582.958	about our crazy theory.
585.334	And that theory was that life
585.334	produces all small molecules,
588.799	so many molecules.
590.497	Like, everything I could think of,
590.497	but not being a chemist.
593.416	Think about it:
594.623	carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide,
596.677	molecular hydrogen, molecular nitrogen,
598.56	methane, methyl chloride --
599.95	so many gases.
601.135	They also exist for other reasons,
603.094	but just life even produces ozone.
604.97	So we go to talk to him about this,
606.752	and immediately, he shot down the theory.
609.226	He found an example that didn't exist.
611.948	So, we went back to the drawing board
613.753	and we think we have found something
613.753	very interesting in another field.
617.205	But back to exoplanets,
618.649	the point is that life produces
618.649	so many different types of gases,
621.952	literally thousands of gases.
624.188	And so what we're doing now
624.188	is just trying to figure out
626.879	on which types of exoplanets,
628.492	which gases could be attributed to life.
634.182	And so when it comes time
634.182	when we find gases
636.254	in exoplanet atmospheres
637.629	that we won't know
637.629	if they're being produced
639.749	by intelligent aliens or by trees,
642.803	or a swamp,
644.037	or even just by simple,
644.037	single-celled microbial life.
647.541	So working on the models
649.115	and thinking about biochemistry,
650.79	it's all well and good.
652.011	But a really big challenge
652.011	ahead of us is: how?
654.92	How are we going to find these planets?
657.106	There are actually many ways
657.106	to find planets,
659.31	several different ways.
660.853	But the one that I'm most focused on
660.853	is how can we open a gateway
664.736	so that in the future,
665.997	we can find hundreds of Earths.
667.87	We have a real shot
667.87	at finding signs of life.
670.227	And actually, I just finished
670.227	leading a two-year project
673.377	in this very special phase
675.489	of a concept we call the starshade.
678.167	And the starshade
678.167	is a very specially shaped screen
681.144	and the goal is to fly that starshade
683.035	so it blocks out the light of a star
686.153	so that the telescope
686.153	can see the planets directly.
689.116	Here, you can see myself
689.116	and two team members
691.533	holding up one small part
691.533	of the starshade.
693.746	It's shaped like a giant flower,
695.35	and this is one of the prototype petals.
698.907	The concept is that a starshade
698.907	and telescope could launch together,
703.392	with the petals unfurling
703.392	from the stowed position.
706.896	The central truss would expand,
708.976	with the petals snapping into place.
712.092	Now, this has to be made very precisely,
714.346	literally, the petals to microns
715.958	and they have to deploy to millimeters.
718.697	And this whole structure would have to fly
720.776	tens of thousands of kilometers
720.776	away from the telescope.
724.159	It's about tens of meters in diameter.
726.785	And the goal is to block out
726.785	the starlight to incredible precision
731.762	so that we'd be able to see
731.762	the planets directly.
735.333	And it has to be a very special shape,
737.586	because of the physics of defraction.
739.499	Now this is a real project
739.499	that we worked on,
741.742	literally, you would not believe how hard.
744.234	Just so you believe
744.234	it's not just in movie format,
746.92	here's a real photograph
748.58	of a second-generation
748.58	starshade deployment test bed in the lab.
753.595	And in this case,
753.595	I just wanted you to know
755.698	that that central truss
755.698	has heritage left over
758.212	from large radio deployables in space.
761.372	So after all of that hard work
763.052	where we try to think of all the crazy
763.052	gases that might be out there,
766.869	and we build the very
766.869	complicated space telescopes
769.821	that might be out there,
771.072	what are we going to find?
772.725	Well, in the best case,
774.507	we will find an image
774.507	of another exo-Earth.
778.328	Here is Earth as a pale blue dot.
780.611	And this is actually
780.611	a real photograph of Earth
783.194	taken by the Voyager 1 spacecraft,
785.088	four billion miles away.
787.159	And that red light is just scattered light
787.159	in the camera optics.
791.315	But what's so awesome to consider
793.735	is that if there are intelligent aliens
796.808	orbiting on a planet
796.808	around a star near to us
800.786	and they build complicated
800.786	space telescopes
802.855	of the kind that we're trying to build,
804.806	all they'll see is this pale blue dot,
807.33	a pinprick of light.
809.456	And so sometimes, when I pause to think
812.546	about my professional struggle
812.546	and huge ambition,
816.823	it's hard to think about that
818.84	in contrast to the vastness
818.84	of the universe.
822.12	But nonetheless, I am devoting
822.12	the rest of my life
826.27	to finding another Earth.
828.296	And I can guarantee
830.535	that in the next generation
830.535	of space telescopes,
832.942	in the second generation,
834.506	we will have the capability
834.506	to find and identity other Earths.
839.936	And the capability
839.936	to split up the starlight
842.634	so that we can look for gases
844.211	and assess the greenhouse gases
844.211	in the atmosphere,
847.721	estimate the surface temperature,
849.343	and look for signs of life.
851.736	But there's more.
853.181	In this case of searching
853.181	for other planets like Earth,
856.569	we are making a new kind of map
859.188	of the nearby stars
859.188	and of the planets orbiting them,
862.472	including [planets] that actually might be
862.472	inhabitable by humans.
866.915	And so I envision that our descendants,
869.32	hundreds of years from now,
871.149	will embark on an interstellar
871.149	journey to other worlds.
875.059	And they will look back at all of us
877.995	as the generation who first found
877.995	the Earth-like worlds.
881.822	Thank you.
882.997	(Applause)
889.532	June Cohen: And I give you,
889.532	for a question,
891.656	Rosetta Mission Manager Fred Jansen.
893.817	Fred Jansen: You mentioned halfway through
895.872	that the technology
895.872	to actually look at the spectrum
899.683	of an exoplanet like Earth
899.683	is not there yet.
902.336	When do you expect this will be there,
904.247	and what's needed?
905.539	Actually, what we expect is what we call
905.539	our next-generation Hubble telescope.
910.531	And this is called the James Webb
910.531	Space Telescope,
912.896	and that will launch in 2018,
914.623	and that's what we're going to do,
916.469	we're going to look
916.469	at a special kind of planet
918.757	called transient exoplanets,
920.237	and that will be our first shot
920.237	at studying small planets
923.362	for gases that might indicate
923.362	the planet is habitable.
927.477	JC: I'm going to ask you
927.477	one follow-up question, too, Sara,
930.31	as the generalist.
931.54	So I am really struck
931.54	by the notion in your career
934.657	of the opposition you faced,
936.08	that when you began thinking
936.08	about exoplanets,
938.248	there was extreme skepticism
938.248	in the scientific community
940.938	that they existed,
942.113	and you proved them wrong.
943.406	What did it take to take that on?
945.143	SS: Well, the thing is that as scientists,
947.237	we're supposed to be skeptical,
949.219	because our job to make sure
949.219	that what the other person is saying
952.291	actually makes sense or not.
953.654	But being a scientist,
956.235	I think you've seen it from this session,
958.679	it's like being an explorer.
960.385	You have this immense curiosity,
962.398	this stubbornness,
963.721	this sort of resolute will
963.721	that you will go forward
966.127	no matter what other people say.
968.182	JC: I love that. Thank you, Sara.
969.882	(Applause)
