12.286	Chris Anderson: So I guess
12.286	what we're going to do is
14.807	we're going to talk about your life,
17.268	and using some pictures
17.268	that you shared with me.
20.426	And I think we should start
20.426	right here with this one.
23.375	Okay, now who is this?
26.423	Martine Rothblatt: This is me
26.423	with our oldest son Eli.
31.492	He was about age five.
33.382	This is taken in Nigeria
35.495	right after having taken
35.495	the Washington, D.C. bar exam.
39.489	CA: Okay. But this doesn't
39.489	really look like a Martine.
44.084	MR: Right. That was myself as a male,
44.084	the way I was brought up.
51.831	Before I transitioned from male
51.831	to female and Martin to Martine.
55.733	CA: You were brought up Martin Rothblatt.
57.762	MR: Correct.
58.807	CA: And about a year after this picture,
58.807	you married a beautiful woman.
63.431	Was this love at first sight?
63.431	What happened there?
65.947	MR: It was love at the first sight.
67.757	I saw Bina at a discotheque
67.757	in Los Angeles,
72.17	and we later began living together,
75.653	but the moment I saw her,
75.653	I saw just an aura of energy around her.
79.484	I asked her to dance.
81.156	She said she saw an aura
81.156	of energy around me.
84.058	I was a single male parent.
84.058	She was a single female parent.
87.753	We showed each other
87.753	our kids' pictures,
90.188	and we've been happily married
90.188	for a third of a century now.
94.298	(Applause)
98.832	CA: And at the time, you were
98.832	kind of this hotshot entrepreneur,
101.89	working with satellites.
103.585	I think you had two successful companies,
105.847	and then you started
105.847	addressing this problem
107.951	of how could you use satellites
107.951	to revolutionize radio.
112.162	Tell us about that.
113.825	MR: Right. I always
113.825	loved space technology,
115.961	and satellites, to me, are sort of
115.961	like the canoes that our ancestors
119.862	first pushed out into the water.
122.021	So it was exciting for me
122.021	to be part of the navigation
125.388	of the oceans of the sky,
127.826	and as I developed different types
127.826	of satellite communication systems,
132.354	the main thing I did was to launch
132.354	bigger and more powerful satellites,
137.655	the consequence of which
137.655	was that the receiving antennas
141.316	could be smaller and smaller,
143.29	and after going through
143.29	direct television broadcasting,
147.144	I had the idea that if we could make
147.144	a more powerful satellite,
150.678	the receiving dish could be so small
153.418	that it would just be a section
153.418	of a parabolic dish,
156.71	a flat little plate embedded
156.71	into the roof of an automobile,
160.449	and it would be possible to have
160.449	nationwide satellite radio,
164.35	and that's Sirius XM today.
166.904	CA: Wow. So who here has used Sirius?
168.924	(Applause)
171.506	MR: Thank you for
171.506	your monthly subscriptions.
173.684	(Laughter)
176.447	CA: So that succeeded despite
176.447	all predictions at the time.
180.649	It was a huge commercial success,
182.878	but soon after this, in the early 1990s,
187.197	there was this big transition in your life
187.197	and you became Martine.
191.713	MR: Correct.
191.713	CA: So tell me, how did that happen?
197.01	MR: It happened in consultation with Bina
197.01	and our four beautiful children,
203.877	and I discussed with each of them
208.749	that I felt my soul was always female,
208.749	and as a woman,
214.739	but I was afraid people would
214.739	laugh at me if I expressed it,
219.334	so I always kept it bottled up
221.863	and just showed my male side.
224.998	And each of them
224.998	had a different take on this.
228.016	"Bina said, ""I love your soul,"
232.497	and whether the outside
232.497	is Martin and Martine,
236.073	it doesn't it matter to me,
236.073	"I love your soul."""
238.488	"My son said, ""If you become a woman,"
238.488	"will you still be my father?"""
246.15	"And I said, ""Yes,"
246.15	"I'll always be your father,"""
249.377	and I'm still his father today.
252.675	My youngest daughter did an absolutely
252.675	brilliant five-year-old thing.
257.226	"She told people, ""I love my dad"
257.226	"and she loves me."""
263.897	So she had no problem
263.897	with a gender blending whatsoever.
268.432	CA: And a couple years after this,
268.432	you published this book:
271.349	"""The Apartheid of Sex."""
273.229	What was your thesis in this book?
275.458	MR: My thesis in this book is that there
275.458	are seven billion people in the world,
279.8	and actually, seven billion unique ways
279.8	to express one's gender.
285.117	And while people may have
285.117	the genitals of a male or a female,
291.549	the genitals don't determine your gender
294.591	or even really your sexual identity.
297.4	That's just a matter of anatomy
299.095	and reproductive tracts,
300.906	and people could choose
300.906	whatever gender they want
304.111	if they weren't forced by society
304.111	into categories of either male or female
309.477	the way South Africa used to force people
309.477	into categories of black or white.
313.778	We know from anthropological science
313.778	that race is fiction,
317.98	even though racism is very, very real,
320.782	and we now know from cultural studies
323.382	that separate male or female genders
323.382	is a constructed fiction.
327.57	The reality is a gender fluidity
330.335	that crosses the entire continuum
330.335	from male to female.
334.225	CA: You yourself don't always
334.225	feel 100 percent female.
337.784	MR: Correct. I would say in some ways
340.019	I change my gender about as often
340.019	as I change my hairstyle.
343.92	CA: (Laughs) Okay, now, this is
343.92	your gorgeous daughter, Jenesis.
351.142	And I guess she was about this age
351.142	when something pretty terrible happened.
355.525	MR: Yes, she was finding herself
355.525	unable to walk up the stairs
360.8	in our house to her bedroom,
362.611	and after several months of doctors,
364.813	she was diagnosed to have a rare,
364.813	almost invariably fatal disease
369.267	called pulmonary arterial hypertension.
373.338	CA: So how did you respond to that?
375.869	MR: Well, we first tried to get her
375.869	to the best doctors we could.
379.398	We ended up at Children's National
379.398	Medical Center in Washington, D.C.
383.415	The head of pediatric cardiology
385.621	told us that he was going to refer her
385.621	to get a lung transplant,
390.105	but not to hold out any hope,
391.984	because there are
391.984	very few lungs available,
394.096	especially for children.
395.861	He said that all people
395.861	with this illness died,
400.319	and if any of you have seen
400.319	"the film ""Lorenzo's Oil,"""
404.939	there's a scene when the protagonist
406.843	kind of rolls down the stairway
406.843	crying and bemoaning the fate of his son,
413.089	and that's exactly
413.089	how we felt about Jenesis.
416.456	CA: But you didn't accept that
416.456	as the limit of what you could do.
420.078	You started trying to research
420.078	and see if you could find a cure somehow.
424.915	MR: Correct. She was in the intensive
424.915	care ward for weeks at a time,
428.739	and Bina and I would tag team
428.739	to stay at the hospital
432.709	while the other watched
432.709	the rest of the kids,
435.101	and when I was in the hospital
435.101	and she was sleeping,
437.678	I went to the hospital library.
439.373	I read every article that I could find
439.373	on pulmonary hypertension.
444.221	I had not taken any biology,
444.221	even in college,
447.68	so I had to go from a biology textbook
447.68	to a college-level textbook
453.307	and then medical textbook
453.307	and the journal articles, back and forth,
457.572	and eventually I knew enough to think
457.572	that it might be possible
461.635	that somebody could find a cure.
463.4	So we started a nonprofit foundation.
467.254	I wrote a description
467.254	asking people to submit grants
471.597	and we would pay for medical research.
474.336	I became an expert on the condition --
474.336	doctors said to me, Martine,
477.981	we really appreciate all the funding
477.981	you've provided us,
481.696	but we are not going to be able
481.696	to find a cure in time
485.736	to save your daughter.
487.454	However, there is a medicine
489.451	that was developed at the
489.451	Burroughs Wellcome Company
494.652	that could halt the progression
494.652	of the disease,
497.764	but Burroughs Wellcome has just
497.764	been acquired by Glaxo Wellcome.
502.57	They made a decision not to develop
504.723	any medicines for rare
504.723	and orphan diseases,
508.015	and maybe you could use your expertise
508.015	in satellite communications
512.612	to develop this cure
512.612	for pulmonary hypertension.
517.191	CA: So how on earth did you get
517.191	access to this drug?
520.254	MR: I went to Glaxo Wellcome
522.428	and after three times being rejected
522.428	and having the door slammed in my face
527.907	because they weren't going
527.907	to out-license the drug
531.415	to a satellite communications expert,
534.208	they weren't going to send the drug
534.208	out to anybody at all,
540.643	and they thought
540.643	I didn't have the expertise,
543.682	finally I was able to persuade
543.682	a small team of people to work with me
550.276	and develop enough credibility.
552.644	I wore down their resistance,
554.525	and they had no hope this drug
554.525	would even work, by the way,
558.095	and they tried to tell me,
558.095	"""You're just wasting your time."
560.813	"We're sorry about your daughter."""
562.414	But finally, for 25,000 dollars
565.432	and agreement to pay 10 percent
565.432	of any revenues we might ever get,
569.89	they agreed to give me
569.89	worldwide rights to this drug.
574.31	CA: And so you put this drug on the market
574.31	in a really brilliant way,
580.616	by basically charging what it would take
580.616	to make the economics work.
585.354	MR: Oh yes, Chris, but this really wasn't
585.354	a drug that I ended up --
589.185	after I wrote the check for 25,000,
592.18	"and I said, ""Okay, where's"
592.18	"the medicine for Jenesis?"""
594.99	"they said, ""Oh, Martine,"
594.99	there's no medicine for Jenesis.
598.171	"This is just something we tried in rats."""
600.377	And they gave me, like,
600.377	a little plastic Ziploc bag
604.092	of a small amount of powder.
605.647	"They said, ""Don't give it to any human,"""
608.457	and they gave me a piece of paper
608.457	which said it was a patent,
612.265	and from that, we had to figure out
612.265	a way to make this medicine.
616.096	A hundred chemists in the U.S.
616.096	at the top universities
619.161	all swore that little patent
619.161	could never be turned into a medicine.
623.83	If it was turned into a medicine,
623.83	it could never be delivered
627.125	because it had a half-life
627.125	of only 45 minutes.
630.352	CA: And yet, a year or two later,
630.352	you were there with a medicine
634.81	that worked for Jenesis.
638.967	MR: Chris, the astonishing thing
638.967	is that this absolutely worthless
644.001	piece of powder
645.654	that had the sparkle of a promise
645.654	of hope for Jenesis
649.717	is not only keeping Jenesis
649.717	and other people alive today,
654.964	but produces almost a billion
654.964	and a half dollars a year in revenue.
659.097	(Applause)
662.923	CA: So here you go.
665.454	So you took this company public, right?
669.007	And made an absolute fortune.
671.537	And how much have you paid Glaxo,
671.537	by the way, after that 25,000?
675.531	MR: Yeah, well, every year we pay them
	last year 100 million dollars.
683.054	It's the best return on investment
683.054	they ever received. (Laughter)
686.165	CA: And the best news of all, I guess,
688.232	is this.
690.089	MR: Yes. Jenesis is an absolutely
690.089	brilliant young lady.
694.362	She's alive, healthy today at 30.
696.985	You see me, Bina and Jenesis there.
699.447	The most amazing thing about Jenesis
702.326	is that while she could do
702.326	anything with her life,
705.228	and believe me, if you grew up
705.228	your whole life with people
708.924	in your face saying
708.924	that you've got a fatal disease,
711.846	I would probably run to Tahiti and just
711.846	not want to run into anybody again.
716.559	But instead she chooses to work
716.559	in United Therapeutics.
719.694	She says she wants to do all she can
719.694	to help other people
723.304	with orphan diseases get medicines,
725.522	and today, she's our project leader
725.522	for all telepresence activities,
730.212	where she helps digitally unite
730.212	the entire company to work together
733.741	to find cures for pulmonary hypertension.
736.69	CA: But not everyone who has this disease
736.69	has been so fortunate.
739.987	There are still many people dying,
739.987	and you are tackling that too. How?
744.442	MR: Exactly, Chris. There's some 3,000
744.442	people a year in the United States alone,
748.926	perhaps 10 times that number worldwide,
751.805	who continue to die of this illness
753.96	because the medicines
753.96	slow down the progression
756.49	but they don't halt it.
758.185	The only cure for pulmonary hypertension,
758.185	pulmonary fibrosis,
762.924	cystic fibrosis, emphysema,
765.36	COPD, what Leonard Nimoy just died of,
768.355	is a lung transplant,
770.863	but sadly, there are only enough
770.863	available lungs for 2,000 people
775.623	in the U.S. a year
775.623	to get a lung transplant,
778.525	whereas nearly a half
778.525	million people a year
781.822	die of end-stage lung failure.
784.121	CA: So how can you address that?
786.815	MR: So I conceptualize the possibility
789.299	that just like we keep cars and planes
792.712	and buildings going forever
795.104	with an unlimited supply
795.104	of building parts and machine parts,
799.331	why can't we create an unlimited supply
799.331	of transplantable organs
802.521	to keep people living indefinitely,
805.459	and especially people with lung disease.
808.106	So we've teamed up with the decoder
808.106	of the human genome, Craig Venter,
813.632	and the company he founded
815.444	with Peter Diamandis,
815.444	the founder of the X Prize,
818.95	to genetically modify
821.016	the pig genome
822.711	so that the pig's organs will not
822.711	be rejected by the human body
827.216	and thereby to create an unlimited supply
830.327	of transplantable organs.
832.742	We do this through our company,
832.742	United Therapeutics.
835.714	CA: So you really believe that within,
835.714	what, a decade,
838.779	that this shortage of transplantable lungs
838.779	maybe be cured, through these guys?
843.26	MR: Absolutely, Chris.
844.839	I'm as certain of that as I was
844.839	of the success that we've had
848.531	with direct television
848.531	broadcasting, Sirius XM.
851.619	It's actually not rocket science.
853.825	It's straightforward engineering away
853.825	one gene after another.
857.284	We're so lucky to be born in the time
857.284	that sequencing genomes
861.626	is a routine activity,
864.285	and the brilliant folks
864.285	at Synthetic Genomics
866.723	are able to zero in on the pig genome,
868.929	find exactly the genes
868.929	that are problematic, and fix them.
872.321	CA: But it's not just bodies that --
872.321	though that is amazing.
875.36	(Applause)
878.681	It's not just long-lasting bodies
878.681	that are of interest to you now.
882.976	It's long-lasting minds.
885.008	And I think this graph for you
885.008	says something quite profound.
890.848	What does this mean?
892.032	MR: What this graph means,
892.032	and it comes from Ray Kurzweil,
895.68	is that the rate of development
895.68	in computer processing
900.46	hardware, firmware and software,
903.293	has been advancing along a curve
906.288	such that by the 2020s, as we saw
906.288	in earlier presentations today,
910.46	there will be information technology
913.625	that processes information
913.625	and the world around us
917.108	at the same rate as a human mind.
920.333	CA: And so that being so, you're actually
920.333	getting ready for this world
924.027	by believing that we will soon
924.027	be able to, what,
928.114	actually take the contents of our brains
928.114	and somehow preserve them forever?
934.457	How do you describe that?
936.287	MR: Well, Chris, what we're working on
936.287	is creating a situation
940.728	where people can create a mind file,
943.213	and a mind file is the collection
943.213	of their mannerisms, personality,
947.221	recollection, feelings,
949.101	beliefs, attitudes and values,
950.657	everything that we've poured today
950.657	into Google, into Amazon, into Facebook,
956.999	and all of this information stored there
956.999	will be able, in the next couple decades,
963.174	once software is able
963.174	to recapitulate consciousness,
967.56	be able to revive the consciousness
967.56	which is imminent in our mind file.
972.474	CA: Now you're not just
972.474	messing around with this.
975.039	You're serious. I mean, who is this?
978.16	MR: This is a robot version of
978.16	my beloved spouse, Bina.
982.549	And we call her Bina 48.
985.01	She was programmed
985.01	by Hanson Robotics out of Texas.
988.609	There's the centerfold
988.609	from National Geographic magazine
991.581	with one of her caregivers,
994.251	and she roams the web
996.294	and has hundreds of hours
996.294	of Bina's mannerisms, personalities.
1001.548	She's kind of like a two-year-old kid,
1003.794	but she says things
1003.794	that blow people away,
1006.975	best expressed by perhaps
1009.61	a New York Times Pulitzer Prize-winning
1009.61	journalist Amy Harmon
1013.418	who says her answers
1013.418	are often frustrating,
1015.996	but other times as compelling as those
1015.996	of any flesh person she's interviewed.
1022.195	CA: And is your thinking here,
1022.195	part of your hope here, is that
1026.593	this version of Bina can in a sense
1026.593	live on forever, or some future upgrade
1033.038	to this version can live on forever?
1035.43	MR: Yes. Not just Bina, but everybody.
1037.836	You know, it costs us virtually nothing
1037.836	to store our mind files
1041.853	on Facebook, Instagram, what-have-you.
1044.779	Social media is I think one of the most
1044.779	extraordinary inventions of our time,
1048.842	and as apps become available
1048.842	that will allow us
1052.836	to out-Siri Siri, better and better,
1055.924	and develop consciousness
1055.924	operating systems,
1058.571	everybody in the world,
1058.571	billions of people,
1061.473	will be able to develop
1061.473	mind clones of themselves
1065.211	that will have their own life on the web.
1067.765	CA: So the thing is, Martine,
1069.219	that in any normal conversation,
1069.219	this would sound stark-staring mad,
1073.342	but in the context of your life,
1073.342	what you've done,
1076.696	some of the things we've heard this week,
1078.786	the constructed realities
1078.786	that our minds give,
1080.982	I mean, you wouldn't bet against it.
1084.776	MR: Well, I think it's really nothing
1084.776	coming from me.
1087.632	If anything, I'm perhaps a bit
1087.632	of a communicator of activities
1094.296	that are being undertaken
1094.296	by the greatest companies
1097.686	in China, Japan, India, the U.S., Europe.
1101.006	There are tens of millions of people
1101.006	working on writing code
1105.709	that expresses more and more aspects
1105.709	of our human consciousness,
1109.424	and you don't have to be a genius
1109.424	to see that all these threads
1114.509	are going to come together
1114.509	and ultimately create human consciousness,
1118.641	and it's something we'll value.
1120.847	There are so many things
1120.847	to do in this life,
1123.285	and if we could have a simulacrum,
1123.285	a digital doppelgänger of ourselves
1127.888	that helps us process books, do shopping,
1130.785	be our best friends,
1132.735	I believe our mind clones,
1132.735	these digital versions of ourselves,
1135.777	will ultimately be our best friends,
1138.378	and for me personally and Bina personally,
1140.398	we love each other like crazy.
1142.186	Each day, we are always saying, like,
1143.982	"""Wow, I love you even more"
1143.982	than 30 years ago.
1146.517	And so for us, the prospect of mind clones
1149.663	and regenerated bodies
1151.707	is that our love affair, Chris,
1151.707	can go on forever.
1154.797	And we never get bored of each other.
1154.797	I'm sure we never will.
1157.999	CA: I think Bina's here, right?
1157.999	MR: She is, yeah.
1160.371	CA: Would it be too much, I don't know,
1160.371	do we have a handheld mic?
1163.554	Bina, could we invite you to the stage?
1163.554	I just have to ask you one question.
1167.246	Besides, we need to see you.
1168.894	(Applause)
1175.442	Thank you, thank you.
1176.998	Come and join Martine here.
1179.691	I mean, look, when you got married,
1184.544	if someone had told you that,
1184.544	in a few years time,
1187.633	the man you were marrying
1187.633	would become a woman,
1189.931	and a few years after that,
1189.931	you would become a robot --
1192.833	(Laughter) --
1195.898	how has this gone? How has it been?
1199.183	Bina Rothblatt: It's been really
1199.183	an exciting journey,
1201.749	and I would have never
1201.749	thought that at the time,
1204.089	but we started making goals
1204.089	and setting those goals
1207.926	and accomplishing things,
1209.197	and before you knew it,
1209.197	we just keep going up and up
1211.664	and we're still not stopping,
1211.664	so it's great.
1214.311	CA: Martine told me something
1214.311	really beautiful,
1217.376	just actually on Skype before this,
1220.135	which was that he wanted
1220.135	to live for hundreds of years
1225.966	as a mind file,
1228.292	but not if it wasn't with you.
1231.424	BR: That's right,
1231.424	we want to do it together.
1233.532	We're cryonicists as well,
1233.532	and we want to wake up together.
1236.785	CA: So just so as you know,
1236.785	from my point of view,
1239.221	this isn't only one of the most
1239.221	astonishing lives I have heard,
1242.936	it's one of the most astonishing
1242.936	love stories I've ever heard.
1245.94	It's just a delight to have you
1245.94	both here at TED.
1248.3	Thank you so much.
1249.646	MR: Thank you.
1251.968	(Applause)
