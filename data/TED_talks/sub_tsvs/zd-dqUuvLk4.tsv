16.018	We're going to begin in 1964.
19.309	Bob Dylan is 23 years old, and his career
22.282	is just reaching its pinnacle.
24.443	He's been christened the voice of a generation,
26.884	and he's churning out classic songs
29.344	at a seemingly impossible rate,
31.307	but there's a small minority of dissenters, and they claim
35.758	that Bob Dylan is stealing other people's songs.
43.637	"takes the Beatles' ""White Album,"""
45.55	"combines it with Jay-Z's ""The Black Album"""
47.327	"to create ""The Grey Album."""
49.151	"""The Grey Album"" becomes an immediate sensation online,"
51.07	and the Beatles' record company sends out countless
53.83	"cease-and-desist letters for ""unfair competition"
57.07	"and dilution of our valuable property."""
60.951	"Now, ""The Grey Album"" is a remix."
62.943	It is new media created from old media.
65.34	It was made using these three techniques:
67.925	copy, transform and combine.
71.167	It's how you remix. You take existing songs,
73.089	you chop them up, you transform the pieces,
74.809	you combine them back together again,
76.649	and you've got a new song, but that new song
78.626	is clearly comprised of old songs.
81.36	But I think these aren't just the components of remixing.
84.673	I think these are the basic elements of all creativity.
87.717	I think everything is a remix,
89.528	and I think this is a better way to conceive of creativity.
94.219	All right, let's head back to 1964, and let's hear
97.212	where some of Dylan's early songs came from.
100.233	We'll do some side-by-side comparisons here.
102.11	All right, this first song you're going to hear
103.316	"is ""Nottamun Town."" It's a traditional folk tune."
105.73	"After that, you'll hear Dylan's ""Masters of War."""
108.318	Jean Ritchie: ♫ In Nottamun Town, not a soul would look out, ♫
113.218	♫ not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down. ♫
119.816	Bob Dylan: ♫ Come you masters of war, ♫
124.09	♫ you that build the big guns, you that build the death planes, ♫
132.695	♫ You that build all the bombs. ♫
135.764	Kirby Ferguson: Okay, so that's the same basic melody
137.686	"and overall structure. This next one is ""The Patriot Game,"""
140.845	by Dominic Behan. Alongside that,
142.837	"you're going to hear ""With God on Our Side,"" by Dylan."
145.111	Dominic Behan: ♫ Come all ye young rebels, ♫
150.369	♫ and list while I sing, ♫
154.899	♫ for the love of one's land is a terrible thing. ♫
163.111	BD: ♫ Oh my name it is nothin', ♫
168.923	♫ my age it means less, ♫
173.451	♫ the country I come from is called the Midwest. ♫
180.27	KF: Okay, so in this case, Dylan admits
181.896	"he must have heard ""The Patriot Game,"" he forgot about it,"
184.336	then when the song kind of bubbled back up
185.895	in his brain, he just thought it was his song.
188.206	"Last one, this is ""Who's Going To Buy You Ribbons,"""
189.438	another traditional folk tune.
190.998	"Alongside that is ""Don't Think Twice, It's All Right."""
193.295	This one's more about the lyric.
195.12	Paul Clayton: ♫ It ain't no use to sit and sigh now, ♫
202.011	♫ darlin', and it ain't no use to sit and cry now. ♫
209.875	BD: ♫ It ain’t no use to sit and wonder why, babe, ♫
215.82	♫ if you don't know by now, ♫
219.472	♫ and it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe, ♫
224.863	♫ it'll never do somehow. ♫
227.75	KF: Okay, now, there's a lot of these.
230.022	It's been estimated that two thirds of the melodies
232.036	Dylan used in his early songs were borrowed.
234.579	This is pretty typical among folk singers.
236.435	Here's the advice of Dylan's idol, Woody Guthrie.
238.798	"""The worlds are the important thing."
240.328	Don't worry about tunes. Take a tune,
242.16	sing high when they sing low,
243.836	"sing fast when they sing slow, and you've got a new tune."""
247.044	(Laughter) (Applause)
251.041	And that's, that's what Guthrie did right here,
252.988	and I'm sure you all recognize the results.
255.595	(Music)
261.512	We know this tune, right? We know it?
263.907	Actually you don't.
265.32	"That is ""When the World's on Fire,"" a very old melody,"
268.004	in this case performed by the Carter Family.
270.265	"Guthrie adapted it into ""This Land Is Your Land."""
272.943	So, Bob Dylan, like all folk singers, he copied melodies,
277.263	he transformed them, he combined them with new lyrics
279.985	which were frequently their own concoction
282.382	of previous stuff.
284.643	Now, American copyright and patent laws run counter
288.306	to this notion that we build on the work of others.
291.029	Instead, these laws and laws around the world
293.696	use the rather awkward analogy of property.
297.418	Now, creative works may indeed be kind of like property,
299.861	but it's property that we're all building on,
302.17	and creations can only take root and grow
304.659	once that ground has been prepared.
307.375	"Henry Ford once said, ""I invented nothing new."
310.221	I simply assembled the discoveries of other men
312.224	behind whom were centuries of work.
314.811	Progress happens when all the factors that make for it
317.194	"are ready and then it is inevitable."""
325.769	Apple undoubtedly brings this innovation to us early,
328.436	but its time was approaching because its core technology
330.933	had been evolving for decades.
332.979	That's multi-touch, controlling a device
334.961	by touching its display.
336.738	Here is Steve Jobs introducing multi-touch
339.157	and making a rather foreboding joke.
341.397	Steve Jobs: And we have invented a new technology
344.2	called multi-touch.
346.46	You can do multi-fingered gestures on it,
348.913	and boy have we patented it. (Laughter)
352.524	KF: Yes. And yet, here is multi-touch in action.
356.69	This is at TED, actually, about a year earlier.
358.711	This is Jeff Han, and, I mean, that's multi-touch.
361.179	It's the same animal, at least.
362.93	Let's hear what Jeff Han has to say about this
364.697	newfangled technology.
366.523	Jeff Han: Multi-touch sensing isn't anything --
368.691	isn't completely new. I mean, people like Bill Buxton
370.897	have been playing around with it in the '80s.
372.546	The technology, you know, isn't the most exciting thing here
375.745	right now other than probably its newfound accessibility.
378.807	KF: So he's pretty frank about it not being new.
380.74	So it's not multi-touch as a whole that's patented.
383.283	It's the small parts of it that are,
385.42	and it's in these small details where
386.724	we can clearly see patent law contradicting its intent:
389.842	to promote the progress of useful arts.
393.003	Here is the first ever slide-to-unlock.
396.187	That is all there is to it. Apple has patented this.
399.056	It's a 28-page software patent, but I will summarize
401.868	what it covers. Spoiler alert: Unlocking your phone
405.804	by sliding an icon with your finger. (Laughter)
408.741	I'm only exaggerating a little bit. It's a broad patent.
411.758	Now, can someone own this idea?
414.607	Now, back in the '80s, there were no software patents,
417.037	and it was Xerox that pioneered the graphical user interface.
420.198	What if they had patented pop-up menus,
423.116	scrollbars, the desktop with icons that look like folders
427.54	and sheets of paper?
429.527	Would a young and inexperienced Apple
431.876	have survived the legal assault from a much larger
434.745	and more mature company like Xerox?
438.825	Now, this idea that everything is a remix might sound
441.272	like common sense until you're the one getting remixed.
445.399	For example ...
447.049	SJ: I mean, Picasso had a saying.
448.288	"He said, ""Good artists copy. Great artists steal."""
451.845	And we have, you know,
454.167	always been shameless about stealing great ideas.
457.295	KF: Okay, so that's in '96. Here's in 2010.
459.193	"""I'm going to destroy Android because it's a stolen product."""
462.102	(Laughter)
463.644	"""I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this."" (Laughter)"
467.283	Okay, so in other words, great artists steal, but not from me.
470.787	(Laughter)
473.138	Now, behavioral economists might refer to this sort of thing as loss aversion
476.746	We have a strong predisposition towards protecting
478.965	what we feel is ours.
480.894	We have no such aversion towards copying
482.812	what other people have, because we do that nonstop.
485.545	So here's the sort of equation we're looking at.
488.02	We've got laws that fundamentally treat creative works as property,
490.677	plus massive rewards or settlements
493.462	in infringement cases, plus huge legal fees
495.659	to protect yourself in court,
497.322	plus cognitive biases against perceived loss.
500.826	And the sum looks like this.
502.969	That is the last four years of lawsuits
505.792	in the realm of smartphones.
508.358	Is this promoting the progress of useful arts?
519.897	in the cultural spotlight is long since past.
523.223	"He records a song called ""Blind Willie McTell,"""
525.832	named after the blues singer, and the song
528.018	is a voyage through the past, through a much darker time,
531.688	but a simpler one, a time when musicians like Willie McTell
534.838	had few illusions about what they did.
537.358	"""I jump 'em from other writers"
539.608	"but I arrange 'em my own way."""
542.173	I think this is mostly what we do.
543.89	Our creativity comes from without, not from within.
547.256	We are not self-made. We are dependent on one another,
550.177	and admitting this to ourselves isn't an embrace
553.002	of mediocrity and derivativeness.
555.836	It's a liberation from our misconceptions,
558.469	and it's an incentive to not expect so much from ourselves
561.552	and to simply begin.
564.287	Thank you so much. It was an honor to be here.
567.237	Thank you. (Applause)
570.014	Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
573.398	Thank you. (Applause)
