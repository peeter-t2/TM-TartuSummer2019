16.249	I want to talk about social innovation
19.879	and social entrepreneurship.
23.314	I happen to have triplets.
26.033	They're little. They're five years old.
28.341	Sometimes I tell people I have triplets.
28.341	"They say, ""Really? How many?"""
31.69	(Laughter)
33.079	Here's a picture of the kids --
33.079	that's Sage, and Annalisa and Rider.
38.656	Now, I also happen to be gay.
43.75	Being gay and fathering triplets is by far
45.842	the most socially innovative,
45.842	socially entrepreneurial thing
48.708	I have ever done.
50.28	(Laughter)
51.359	(Applause)
55.031	The real social innovation I want
55.031	to talk about involves charity.
59.436	I want to talk about how the things
59.436	we've been taught to think
62.83	about giving and about charity
65.088	and about the nonprofit sector,
66.993	are actually undermining
66.993	the causes we love,
70.962	and our profound yearning
70.962	to change the world.
74.647	But before I do that,
74.647	I want to ask if we even believe
77.352	that the nonprofit sector
77.352	has any serious role to play
80.33	in changing the world.
82.514	A lot of people say now that business
82.514	will lift up the developing economies,
86.18	and social business
86.18	will take care of the rest.
89.426	And I do believe that business will move
89.426	the great mass of humanity forward.
95.017	But it always leaves behind
95.017	that 10 percent or more
98.937	that is most disadvantaged or unlucky.
103.13	And social business needs markets,
104.774	and there are some issues
104.774	for which you just can't develop
107.56	the kind of money measures
107.56	that you need for a market.
110.394	I sit on the board of a center
110.394	for the developmentally disabled,
113.972	and these people want laughter
116.306	and compassion and they want love.
120.718	How do you monetize that?
123.909	And that's where the nonprofit sector
123.909	and philanthropy come in.
128.266	Philanthropy is the market for love.
131.855	It is the market for all those people
134.276	for whom there is no other market coming.
137.116	And so if we really want,
137.116	like Buckminster Fuller said,
139.847	a world that works for everyone,
142.236	with no one and nothing left out,
144.74	then the nonprofit sector has to be
146.902	a serious part of the conversation.
150.01	But it doesn't seem to be working.
152.433	Why have our breast cancer
152.433	charities not come close
154.862	to finding a cure for breast cancer,
156.608	or our homeless charities not come close
158.584	to ending homelessness in any major city?
161.667	Why has poverty remained stuck
163.669	at 12 percent of the U.S.
163.669	population for 40 years?
169.275	And the answer is,
170.905	these social problems
170.905	are massive in scale,
174.184	our organizations
174.184	are tiny up against them,
176.962	and we have a belief system
176.962	that keeps them tiny.
180.707	We have two rulebooks.
181.901	We have one for the nonprofit sector,
183.791	and one for the rest
183.791	of the economic world.
187.183	It's an apartheid, and it discriminates
189.274	against the nonprofit sector
189.274	in five different areas,
192.224	the first being compensation.
195.234	So in the for-profit sector,
195.234	the more value you produce,
197.902	the more money you can make.
199.464	But we don't like nonprofits to use money
201.572	to incentivize people
201.572	to produce more in social service.
205.524	We have a visceral reaction
205.524	to the idea that anyone
208.035	would make very much money
208.035	helping other people.
211.476	Interestingly, we don't have
211.476	a visceral reaction
213.745	to the notion that people
213.745	would make a lot of money
216.174	not helping other people.
217.423	You know, you want to make
219.548	selling violent video games
219.548	to kids, go for it.
221.794	We'll put you on the cover
221.794	of Wired magazine.
223.939	But you want to make
223.939	half a million dollars
225.987	trying to cure kids of malaria,
227.5	and you're considered a parasite yourself.
230.644	(Applause)
235.596	And we think of this
235.596	as our system of ethics,
238.041	but what we don't realize
238.041	is that this system
240.208	has a powerful side effect, which is:
243.39	It gives a really stark,
243.39	mutually exclusive choice
247.168	between doing very well
247.168	for yourself and your family
250.826	or doing good for the world,
253.244	to the brightest minds
253.244	coming out of our best universities,
256.062	and sends tens of thousands of people
258.196	who could make a huge difference
258.196	in the nonprofit sector,
260.918	marching every year
260.918	directly into the for-profit sector
263.538	because they're not willing to make
263.538	that kind of lifelong economic sacrifice.
268.664	Businessweek did a survey,
268.664	looked at the compensation packages
271.633	for MBAs 10 years out of business school.
274.676	And the median compensation
274.676	for a Stanford MBA,
277.424	with bonus, at the age of 38,
277.424	was 400,000 dollars.
282.232	Meanwhile, for the same year,
282.232	the average salary
284.526	for the CEO of a $5 million-plus
284.526	medical charity in the U.S.
287.379	was 232,000 dollars,
287.379	and for a hunger charity, 84,000 dollars.
293.025	Now, there's no way you're
293.025	going to get a lot of people
295.645	with $400,000 talent to make
295.645	a $316,000 sacrifice every year
299.724	to become the CEO of a hunger charity.
303.027	"Some people say, ""Well, that's just"
303.027	"because those MBA types are greedy."""
306.576	Not necessarily. They might be smart.
309.283	It's cheaper for that person to donate
	to the hunger charity;
315.136	save 50,000 dollars on their taxes --
317.074	so still be roughly 270,000 dollars
317.074	a year ahead of the game --
321.523	now be called a philanthropist
321.523	because they donated
326	probably sit on the board
326	of the hunger charity;
328.282	indeed, probably supervise the poor SOB
330.202	who decided to become the CEO
330.202	of the hunger charity;
332.972	(Laughter)
334.003	and have a lifetime
334.003	of this kind of power and influence
337.378	and popular praise still ahead of them.
341.106	The second area of discrimination
341.106	is advertising and marketing.
344.588	So we tell the for-profit sector,
344.588	"""Spend, spend, spend on advertising,"
348.093	until the last dollar no longer
348.093	"produces a penny of value."""
351.955	But we don't like to see our donations
351.955	spent on advertising in charity.
355.329	"Our attitude is, ""Well, look,"
355.329	if you can get the advertising donated,
359.328	you know, to air at four o'clock
359.328	in the morning, I'm okay with that.
362.597	But I don't want my donation
362.597	spent on advertising,
364.985	"I want it go to the needy."""
366.576	As if the money invested in advertising
368.458	could not bring in dramatically
368.458	greater sums of money
371.112	to serve the needy.
373.113	In the 1990s, my company created
375.228	the long-distance
375.228	AIDSRide bicycle journeys,
378.627	and the 60 mile-long
378.627	breast cancer three-day walks,
383.2	and over the course of nine years,
386.184	we had 182,000 ordinary
386.184	heroes participate,
391.247	and they raised a total
391.247	of 581 million dollars.
395.167	(Applause)
398.331	They raised more money
398.331	more quickly for these causes
400.808	than any events in history,
402.498	all based on the idea
402.498	that people are weary
405.316	of being asked to do the least
405.316	they can possibly do.
408.142	People are yearning to measure
408.142	the full distance of their potential
412.732	on behalf of the causes
412.732	that they care about deeply.
416.073	But they have to be asked.
419.097	We got that many people to participate
420.954	by buying full-page ads
420.954	in The New York Times,
423.189	in The Boston Globe, in prime time
423.189	radio and TV advertising.
426.626	Do you know how many people
426.626	we would've gotten
428.809	if we put up fliers in the laundromat?
432.274	Charitable giving has remained stuck
432.274	in the U.S., at two percent of GDP,
436.504	ever since we started
436.504	measuring it in the 1970s.
439.287	That's an important fact,
439.287	because it tells us
441.624	that in 40 years, the nonprofit sector
444.338	has not been able
444.338	to wrestle any market share
447.443	away from the for-profit sector.
450.2	And if you think about it,
450.2	how could one sector
452.418	possibly take market share
452.418	away from another sector
455.499	if it isn't really allowed to market?
458.701	And if we tell the consumer brands,
460.439	"""You may advertise"
460.439	"all the benefits of your product,"""
463.019	"but we tell charities, ""You cannot"
463.019	"advertise all the good that you do,"""
466.424	where do we think the consumer
466.424	dollars are going to flow?
470.415	The third area of discrimination
470.415	is the taking of risk
473.273	in pursuit of new ideas
473.273	for generating revenue.
477.388	So Disney can make a new
477.388	$200 million movie that flops,
481.059	and nobody calls the attorney general.
483.996	But you do a little $1 million
483.996	community fundraiser for the poor,
487.919	and it doesn't produce a 75 percent profit
487.919	to the cause in the first 12 months,
491.836	and your character
491.836	is called into question.
494.656	So nonprofits are really reluctant
494.656	to attempt any brave,
498.116	daring, giant-scale
498.116	new fundraising endeavors,
501.067	for fear that if the thing fails,
502.692	their reputations will be dragged
502.692	through the mud.
505.088	Well, you and I know
506.271	when you prohibit failure,
506.271	you kill innovation.
509.119	If you kill innovation in fundraising,
509.119	you can't raise more revenue;
512.357	if you can't raise more revenue,
512.357	you can't grow;
514.662	and if you can't grow, you can't
514.662	possibly solve large social problems.
518.868	The fourth area is time.
521.36	So Amazon went for six years
521.36	without returning any profit to investors,
525.183	and people had patience.
527.042	They knew that there was a long-term
527.042	objective down the line,
529.947	of building market dominance.
531.557	But if a nonprofit organization
531.557	ever had a dream
534.164	of building magnificent scale
534.164	that required that for six years,
538.438	no money was going to go to the needy,
540.326	it was all going to be invested
540.326	in building this scale,
542.986	we would expect a crucifixion.
545.803	The last area is profit itself.
547.454	So the for-profit sector
547.454	can pay people profits
549.994	in order to attract their capital
549.994	for their new ideas,
552.591	but you can't pay profits
552.591	in a nonprofit sector,
555.731	so the for-profit sector has a lock
557.727	on the multi-trillion-dollar
557.727	capital markets,
560.232	and the nonprofit sector is starved
560.232	for growth and risk and idea capital.
566.024	Well, you put those
566.024	five things together --
568.064	you can't use money to lure talent
568.064	away from the for-profit sector;
571.242	you can't advertise
571.242	on anywhere near the scale
573.457	the for-profit sector
573.457	does for new customers;
575.835	you can't take the kinds of risks
575.835	in pursuit of those customers
578.823	that the for-profit sector takes;
580.535	you don't have the same amount of time
580.535	to find them as the for-profit sector;
584.192	and you don't have a stock market
584.192	with which to fund any of this,
587.28	even if you could do it
587.28	in the first place --
589.416	and you've just put the nonprofit sector
591.36	at an extreme disadvantage
591.36	to the for-profit sector,
594.044	on every level.
597.321	If we have any doubts about the effects
597.321	of this separate rule book,
600.511	this statistic is sobering:
602.059	From 1970 to 2009,
604.423	the number of nonprofits that really grew,
607.178	that crossed the $50 million
607.178	annual revenue barrier,
610.382	is 144.
612.534	In the same time, the number
612.534	of for-profits that crossed it
615.368	is 46,136.
618.436	So we're dealing with social problems
618.436	that are massive in scale,
621.523	and our organizations
621.523	can't generate any scale.
623.873	All of the scale goes
623.873	to Coca-Cola and Burger King.
628.388	So why do we think this way?
631.039	Well, like most fanatical
631.039	dogma in America,
635.276	these ideas come from old Puritan beliefs.
638.741	The Puritans came here
638.741	for religious reasons, or so they said,
641.836	but they also came here because
641.836	they wanted to make a lot of money.
645.343	They were pious people,
646.796	but they were also
646.796	really aggressive capitalists,
649.835	and they were accused of extreme forms
649.835	of profit-making tendencies,
653.379	compared to the other colonists.
655.784	But at the same time,
655.784	the Puritans were Calvinists,
658.804	so they were taught literally
658.804	to hate themselves.
661.351	They were taught
661.351	that self-interest was a raging sea
664.419	that was a sure path to eternal damnation.
667.84	This created a real problem
667.84	for these people.
669.982	Here they've come all the way across
669.982	the Atlantic to make all this money,
673.523	but making all this money
673.523	will get you sent directly to Hell.
676.722	What were they to do about this?
678.594	Well, charity became their answer.
680.256	It became this economic sanctuary,
682.711	where they could do penance
682.711	for their profit-making tendencies --
686.354	at five cents on the dollar.
689.339	So of course, how could you
689.339	make money in charity
691.697	if charity was your penance
691.697	for making money?
694.442	Financial incentive was exiled
694.442	from the realm of helping others,
698.323	so that it could thrive in the area
698.323	of making money for yourself,
701.752	and in 400 years, nothing has intervened
704.943	"to say, ""That's counterproductive"
704.943	"and that's unfair."""
710.375	Now, this ideology gets policed
710.375	by this one very dangerous question,
714.064	"which is, ""What percentage of my donation"
714.064	"goes to the cause versus overhead?"""
718.653	There are a lot of problems
718.653	with this question.
720.884	I'm going to just focus on two.
722.408	First, it makes us think
722.408	that overhead is a negative,
726.497	that it is somehow not part of the cause.
730.282	But it absolutely is, especially
730.282	if it's being used for growth.
735.251	Now, this idea that overhead
735.251	is somehow an enemy of the cause
739.196	creates this second, much larger problem,
741.721	which is, it forces organizations
741.721	to go without the overhead things
745.581	they really need to grow,
747.213	in the interest of keeping overhead low.
750.184	So we've all been taught
750.184	that charities should spend
752.716	as little as possible on overhead
752.716	things like fundraising
755.515	under the theory that, well, the less
755.515	money you spend on fundraising,
758.913	the more money there is
758.913	available for the cause.
762.595	Well, that's true
762.595	if it's a depressing world
764.962	in which this pie cannot
764.962	be made any bigger.
768.38	But if it's a logical world
768.38	in which investment in fundraising
771.769	actually raises more funds
771.769	and makes the pie bigger,
775.279	then we have it precisely backwards,
777.16	and we should be investing more money,
777.16	not less, in fundraising,
780.732	because fundraising is the one thing
782.485	that has the potential
782.485	to multiply the amount of money
785.12	available for the cause
785.12	that we care about so deeply.
789.747	I'll give you two examples.
791.064	We launched the AIDSRides
792.334	with an initial investment
792.334	of 50,000 dollars in risk capital.
795.866	Within nine years,
795.866	we had multiplied that 1,982 times,
800.869	into 108 million dollars
800.869	after all expenses, for AIDS services.
806.478	We launched the breast cancer three-days
808.415	with an initial investment
808.415	of 350,000 dollars in risk capital.
812.243	Within just five years,
812.243	we had multiplied that 554 times,
816.997	into 194 million dollars
816.997	after all expenses,
820.6	for breast cancer research.
822.23	Now, if you were a philanthropist
822.23	really interested in breast cancer,
825.568	what would make more sense:
826.885	go out and find the most innovative
826.885	researcher in the world
830.76	and give her 350,000 dollars for research,
834.164	or give her fundraising
834.164	department the 350,000 dollars
837.807	to multiply it into 194 million dollars
837.807	for breast cancer research?
846.109	We netted for breast cancer
846.109	alone, that year alone,
853.113	And then we went out of business,
855.457	suddenly and traumatically.
858.569	Why? Well, the short story is,
858.569	our sponsors split on us.
863.307	They wanted to distance themselves from us
865.394	because we were being
865.394	crucified in the media
868.275	for investing 40 percent
868.275	of the gross in recruitment
871.677	and customer service
871.677	and the magic of the experience,
875.065	and there is no accounting
875.065	terminology to describe
877.952	that kind of investment
877.952	in growth and in the future,
881.126	other than this demonic
881.126	"label of ""overhead."""
886.038	So on one day, all 350
886.038	of our great employees
891.436	lost their jobs ...
895.92	"because they were labeled ""overhead."""
899.078	Our sponsor went and tried
899.078	the events on their own.
901.642	The overhead went up.
902.999	Net income for breast cancer research
902.999	went down by 84 percent,
906.792	or 60 million dollars, in one year.
911.244	This is what happens when we confuse
911.244	morality with frugality.
918.619	We've all been taught that the bake sale
918.619	with five percent overhead
921.809	is morally superior to the professional
921.809	fundraising enterprise
924.784	with 40 percent overhead,
926.474	but we're missing the most important
926.474	piece of information, which is:
929.775	What is the actual size of these pies?
932.934	Who cares if the bake sale only has
932.934	five percent overhead if it's tiny?
937.573	What if the bake sale
937.573	only netted 71 dollars for charity
940.429	because it made no investment in its scale
942.477	and the professional
942.477	fundraising enterprise netted
947.831	Now which pie would we prefer,
949.45	and which pie do we think people
949.45	who are hungry would prefer?
953.577	Here's how all of this
953.577	impacts the big picture.
957.251	I said that charitable giving is
957.251	two percent of GDP in the United States.
960.752	That's about 300 billion dollars a year.
963.466	But only about 20 percent of that,
963.466	or 60 billion dollars,
966.853	goes to health and human services causes.
968.83	The rest goes to religion
968.83	and higher education and hospitals,
972.48	and that 60 billion dollars
972.48	is not nearly enough
975.402	to tackle these problems.
977.609	But if we could move charitable giving
977.609	from two percent of GDP,
981.983	up just one step to three percent of GDP,
981.983	by investing in that growth,
988.645	that would be an extra 150 billion dollars
988.645	a year in contributions,
992.704	and if that money
992.704	could go disproportionately
995.086	to health and human services charities,
996.969	because those were the ones we encouraged
996.969	to invest in their growth,
1000.232	that would represent a tripling
1000.232	of contributions to that sector.
1004.573	Now we're talking scale.
1006.205	Now we're talking the potential
1006.205	for real change.
1009.831	But it's never going to happen
1009.831	by forcing these organizations
1012.95	to lower their horizons
1014.802	to the demoralizing objective
1014.802	of keeping their overhead low.
1020.397	Our generation does not want
1020.397	its epitaph to read,
1023.753	"""We kept charity overhead low."""
1025.904	(Laughter)
1030.452	(Applause)
1034.308	We want it to read
1034.308	that we changed the world,
1036.539	and that part of the way we did that
1038.278	was by changing the way
1038.278	we think about these things.
1041.566	So the next time
1041.566	you're looking at a charity,
1043.717	don't ask about the rate
1043.717	of their overhead.
1045.822	Ask about the scale of their dreams,
1048.161	their Apple-, Google-,
1048.161	Amazon-scale dreams,
1051.741	how they measure their progress
1051.741	toward those dreams,
1054.234	and what resources they need
1054.234	to make them come true,
1056.893	regardless of what the overhead is.
1058.68	Who cares what the overhead is
1060.308	if these problems
1060.308	are actually getting solved?
1063.627	If we can have that kind of generosity --
1066.627	a generosity of thought --
1068.779	then the non-profit sector
1068.779	can play a massive role
1071.679	in changing the world
1071.679	for all those citizens
1075.135	most desperately in need of it to change.
1081.076	And if that can be
1081.076	our generation's enduring legacy --
1085.922	that we took responsibility
1088.818	for the thinking that had
1088.818	been handed down to us,
1091.337	that we revisited it, we revised it,
1094.177	and we reinvented the whole way
1094.177	humanity thinks about changing things,
1098.283	forever, for everyone --
1101.783	well, I thought I would let
1101.783	the kids sum up what that would be.
1106.561	Annalisa Smith-Pallotta: That would be
1108.436	Sage Smith-Pallotta: a real social
1110.442	Rider Smith-Pallotta: innovation.
1112.688	Dan Pallotta: Thank you very much.
1114.363	Thank you.
1115.642	(Applause)
1124.778	Thank you.
1125.975	(Applause)
