26	Like many of you here, I am trying to contribute
31	towards a renaissance in Africa.
34	The question of transformation in Africa
36	really is a question of leadership.
38	Africa can only be transformed by enlightened leaders.
43	And it is my contention that the manner in which
45	we educate our leaders is fundamental
49	to progress on this continent.
53	I want to tell you some stories that explain my view.
58	We all heard about the importance of stories yesterday.
62	An American friend of mine this year volunteered as a nurse in Ghana,
67	and in a period of three months she came to a conclusion
70	about the state of leadership in Africa
73	that had taken me over a decade to reach.
76	Twice she was involved in surgeries
79	where they lost power at the hospital.
84	The emergency generators did not start.
87	There was not a flashlight, not a lantern, not a candle --
92	pitch black.
93	The patient's cut open, twice.
98	The first time it was a C-section.
102	Thankfully, baby was out -- mother and child survived.
107	The second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia.
112	Anesthetic wears off. The patient feels pain.
115	He's crying. He's screaming. He's praying.
120	Pitch black. Not a candle, not a flashlight.
126	And that hospital could have afforded flashlights.
130	They could have afforded to purchase these things, but they didn't.
134	And it happened twice.
136	Another time, she watched in horror as nurses watched a patient die
142	because they refused to give her oxygen that they had.
148	And so three months later,
150	just before she returned to the United States,
153	nurses in Accra go on strike.
155	And her recommendation is
158	take this opportunity to fire everyone, start all over again.
162	Start all over again.
164	Now what does this have to do with leadership?
169	You see, the folks at the ministry of health,
174	the hospital administrators, the doctors, the nurses --
180	they are among just five percent of their peers
184	who get an education after secondary school.
188	They are the elite. They are our leaders.
192	Their decisions, their actions matter.
195	And when they fail, a nation literally suffers.
200	So when I speak of leadership,
202	I'm not talking about just political leaders.
206	We've heard a lot about that.
208	I'm talking about the elite.
212	Those who've been trained,
214	whose job it is to be the guardians of their society.
219	The lawyers, the judges, the policemen, the doctors,
223	the engineers, the civil servants --
227	those are the leaders.
229	And we need to train them right.
232	Now, my first pointed and memorable experience with leadership in Ghana
238	occurred when I was 16 years old.
240	We had just had a military coup,
242	and soldiers were pervasive in our society.
245	They were a pervasive presence.
247	And one day I go to the airport to meet my father,
250	and as I walk up this grassy slope from the car park
253	to the terminal building,
256	I'm stopped by two soldiers wielding AK-47 assault weapons.
261	And they asked me to join a crowd of people
265	that were running up and down this embankment.
269	Why? Because the path I had taken was considered out of bounds.
275	No sign to this effect.
278	Now, I was 16. I was very worried about
282	what my peers at school might think
284	if they saw me running up and down this hill.
286	I was especially concerned of what the girls might think.
291	And so I started to argue with these men.
293	It was a little reckless, but you know, I was 16.
295	I got lucky.
297	A Ghana Airways pilot falls into the same predicament.
301	Because of his uniform they speak to him differently,
303	and they explain to him that they're just following orders.
306	So he takes their radio, talks to their boss,
309	and gets us all released.
311	What lessons would you take from an experience like this?
314	Several, for me.
316	Leadership matters. Those men are following
319	the orders of a superior officer.
323	I learned something about courage.
325	It was important not to look at those guns.
329	And I also learned that it can be helpful to think about girls.
333	(Laughter)
335	So a few years after this event, I leave Ghana on a scholarship
341	to go to Swarthmore College for my education.
344	It was a breath of fresh air.
347	You know, the faculty there didn't want us to memorize information
352	and repeat back to them as I was used to back in Ghana.
356	They wanted us to think critically.
358	They wanted us to be analytical.
360	They wanted us to be concerned about social issues.
364	In my economics classes I got high marks
367	for my understanding of basic economics.
370	But I learned something more profound than that,
373	which is that the leaders -- the managers of Ghana's economy --
380	were making breathtakingly bad decisions
383	that had brought our economy to the brink of collapse.
387	And so here was this lesson again -- leadership matters.
390	It matters a great deal.
393	But I didn't really fully understand what had happened to me at Swarthmore.
397	I had an inkling,
400	but I didn't fully realize it until I went out into the workplace
404	and I went to work at Microsoft Corporation.
408	And I was part of this team -- this thinking, learning team
413	whose job it was to design and implement new software
418	that created value in the world.
421	And it was brilliant to be part of this team.
424	It was brilliant.
426	And I realized just what had happened to me at Swarthmore,
430	this transformation --
432	the ability to confront problems, complex problems,
437	and to design solutions to those problems.
440	The ability to create is the most empowering thing
444	that can happen to an individual.
446	And I was part of that.
449	Now, while I was at Microsoft, the annual revenues of that company
454	grew larger than the GDP of the Republic of Ghana.
459	And by the way, it's continued to.
462	The gap has widened since I left.
466	Now, I've already spoken about one of the reasons why this has occurred.
470	I mean, it's the people there who are so hardworking,
473	persistent, creative, empowered.
479	But there were also some external factors:
482	free markets, the rule of law, infrastructure.
487	These things were provided by institutions
491	run by the people that I call leaders.
495	And those leaders did not emerge spontaneously.
498	Somebody trained them to do the work that they do.
503	Now, while I was at Microsoft, this funny thing happened.
505	I became a parent.
507	And for the first time, Africa mattered more to me than ever before.
512	Because I realized that the state of the African continent
516	would matter to my children and their children.
520	That the state of the world -- the state of the world
526	depends on what's happening to Africa,
531	as far as my kids would be concerned.
533	And at this time, when I was going through
537	"what I call my ""pre-mid-life crisis,"""
541	Africa was a mess.
543	Somalia had disintegrated into anarchy.
545	Rwanda was in the throes of this genocidal war.
549	And it seemed to me that that was the wrong direction,
551	and I needed to be back helping.
554	I couldn't just stay in Seattle and raise my kids
558	in an upper-middle class neighborhood and feel good about it.
562	This was not the world that I'd want my children to grow up in.
568	So I decided to get engaged, and the first thing that I did
572	was to come back to Ghana and talk with a lot of people
576	and really try to understand what the real issues were.
580	And three things kept coming up for every problem:
585	corruption, weak institutions
588	and the people who run them -- the leaders.
592	Now, I was a little scared
594	because when you see those three problems,
596	they seem really hard to deal with.
599	"And they might say, ""Look, don't even try."""
601	But, for me, I asked the question,
604	"""Well, where are these leaders coming from?"
608	What is it about Ghana that produces leaders
612	"that are unethical or unable to solve problems?"""
616	So I went to look at what was happening in our educational system.
619	And it was the same -- learning by rote --
621	from primary school through graduate school.
625	Very little emphasis on ethics,
630	and the typical graduate
634	from a university in Ghana has a stronger sense
638	of entitlement than a sense of responsibility.
642	This is wrong.
644	So I decided to engage this particular problem.
649	Because it seems to me that every society, every society,
655	must be very intentional about how it trains its leaders.
659	And Ghana was not paying enough attention.
662	And this is true across sub-Saharan Africa, actually.
669	So this is what I'm doing now.
671	I'm trying to bring the experience that I had at Swarthmore to Africa.
678	I wish there was a liberal arts college in every African country.
682	I think it would make a huge difference.
685	And what Ashesi University is trying to do
690	is to train a new generation of ethical, entrepreneurial leaders.
697	We're trying to train leaders of exceptional integrity,
701	who have the ability to confront the complex problems,
704	ask the right questions, and come up with workable solutions.
709	"I'll admit that there are times when it seems like ""Mission: Impossible,"""
716	but we must believe that these kids are smart.
720	That if we involve them in their education,
723	if we have them discuss the real issues that they confront --
727	that our whole society confronts --
730	and if we give them skills that enable them to engage the real world,
736	that magic will happen.
741	Now, a month into this project, we'd just started classes.
749	And a month into it, I come to the office,
752	and I have this email from one of our students.
755	"And it said, very simply, ""I am thinking now."""
760	"And he signs off, ""Thank you."""
765	It's such a simple statement.
768	But I was moved almost to tears
770	because I understood what was happening to this young man.
775	And it is an awesome thing to be a part
779	of empowering someone in this way.
784	I am thinking now.
788	This year we challenged our students
792	to craft an honor code themselves.
795	There's a very vibrant debate going on on campus now
798	over whether they should have an honor code,
801	and if so, what it should look like.
804	One of the students asked a question that just warmed my heart.
808	Can we create a perfect society?
814	Her understanding that a student-crafted honor code
820	constitutes a reach towards perfection is incredible.
826	Now, we cannot achieve perfection,
828	but if we reach for it, then we can achieve excellence.
834	I don't know ultimately what they will do.
836	I don't know whether they will decide to have this honor code.
840	But the conversation they're having now --
842	about what their good society should look like,
846	what their excellent society should look like,
849	is a really good thing.
855	Am I out of time? OK.
861	Now, I just wanted to leave that slide up
867	because it's important that we think about it.
870	I'm very excited about the fact
873	that every student at Ashesi University does community service before they graduate.
879	That for many of them, it has been a life-altering experience.
884	These young future leaders are beginning to understand
892	the real business of leadership,
894	the real privilege of leadership,
896	which is after all to serve humanity.
901	I am even more thrilled by the fact that least year
906	our student body elected a woman
908	to be the head of Student Government.
912	It's the first time in the history of Ghana
915	that a woman has been elected head of Student Government
919	at any university.
922	It says a lot about her.
924	It says a lot about the culture that's forming on campus.
929	It says a lot about her peers who elected her.
932	She won with 75 percent of the vote.
938	And it gives me a lot of hope.
941	It turns out that corporate West Africa
944	also appreciates what's happening with our students.
948	We've graduated two classes of students to date.
952	And every single one of them has been placed.
955	And we're getting great reports back
957	from corporate Ghana, corporate West Africa,
961	and the things that they're most impressed about is work ethic.
966	You know, that passion for what they're doing.
970	The persistence, their ability to deal with ambiguity,
974	their ability to tackle problems that they haven't seen before.
980	This is good because
984	over the past five years, there have been times
987	"when I've felt this is ""Mission: Impossible."""
990	And it's just wonderful to see these glimmers
993	of the promise of what can happen if we train our kids right.
1000	I think that the current and future leaders of Africa
1004	have an incredible opportunity
1007	to drive a major renaissance on the continent.
1010	It's an incredible opportunity.
1012	There aren't very many more opportunities like this in the world.
1016	I believe that Africa has reached an inflection point
1024	with a march of democracy and free markets across the continent.
1028	We have reached a moment from which can emerge
1031	a great society within one generation.
1035	It will depend on inspired leadership.
1040	And it is my contention that the manner in which we train our leaders
1046	will make all the difference.
1047	Thank you, and God bless.
1049	(Applause)
