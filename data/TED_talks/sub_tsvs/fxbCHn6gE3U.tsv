13.12	Seven years ago, a student came to me
13.12	and asked me to invest in his company.
17.56	"He said, ""I'm working with three friends,"
19.56	and we're going to try to disrupt
19.56	"an industry by selling stuff online."""
23.64	"And I said, ""OK, you guys spent"
23.64	"the whole summer on this, right?"""
26.72	"""No, we all took internships"
26.72	"just in case it doesn't work out."""
29.88	"""All right, but you're going to"
29.88	"go in full time once you graduate."""
33.64	"""Not exactly. We've all"
33.64	"lined up backup jobs."""
37.6	Six months go by,
38.88	it's the day before the company launches,
40.88	and there is still
40.88	not a functioning website.
43.4	"""You guys realize,"
43.4	the entire company is a website.
45.84	"That's literally all it is."""
48.8	So I obviously declined to invest.
53.52	And they ended up
53.52	naming the company Warby Parker.
55.92	(Laughter)
57.56	They sell glasses online.
60.48	They were recently recognized
60.48	as the world's most innovative company
63.72	and valued at over a billion dollars.
65.76	And now? My wife handles our investments.
70.88	Why was I so wrong?
73	To find out, I've been studying people
73	"that I come to call ""originals."""
77.2	Originals are nonconformists,
79.04	people who not only have new ideas
81.48	but take action to champion them.
83.92	They are people
83.92	who stand out and speak up.
86.48	Originals drive creativity
86.48	and change in the world.
89.44	They're the people you want to bet on.
91.6	And they look nothing like I expected.
94.76	I want to show you today
94.76	three things I've learned
97.2	about recognizing originals
99.24	and becoming a little bit more like them.
102.44	So the first reason
102.44	that I passed on Warby Parker
105.8	was they were really slow
105.8	getting off the ground.
109.08	Now, you are all intimately familiar
109.08	with the mind of a procrastinator.
114.96	Well, I have a confession for you.
114.96	I'm the opposite. I'm a precrastinator.
120.12	Yes, that's an actual term.
121.48	You know that panic you feel
121.48	a few hours before a big deadline
124.44	when you haven't done anything yet.
126.76	I just feel that
126.76	a few months ahead of time.
129.12	(Laughter)
131.92	So this started early: when I was a kid,
131.92	I took Nintendo games very seriously.
138.6	I would wake up at 5am,
140.639	start playing and not stop
140.639	until I had mastered them.
144.32	Eventually it got so out of hand
144.32	that a local newspaper came
147.84	and did a story on the dark side
147.84	of Nintendo, starring me.
151.84	(Laughter)
154.72	(Applause)
161.44	Since then, I have traded hair for teeth.
164.44	(Laughter)
169	But this served me well in college,
172.04	because I finished my senior thesis
172.04	four months before the deadline.
178.16	And I was proud of that,
178.16	until a few years ago.
181.84	I had a student named Jihae,
181.84	who came to me and said,
185.88	"""I have my most creative ideas"
185.88	"when I'm procrastinating."""
189.36	"And I was like, ""That's cute,"
189.36	"where are the four papers you owe me?"""
192.6	(Laughter)
193.72	No, she was one
193.72	of our most creative students,
195.92	and as an organizational psychologist,
195.92	this is the kind of idea that I test.
200.2	So I challenged her to get some data.
202.24	She goes into a bunch of companies.
203.96	She has people fill out surveys
203.96	about how often they procrastinate.
207.4	Then she gets their bosses to rate
207.4	how creative and innovative they are.
211.04	And sure enough,
211.04	the precrastinators like me,
213.92	who rush in and do everything early
215.88	are rated as less creative
217.64	than people who procrastinate moderately.
220.48	So I want to know what happens
220.48	to the chronic procrastinators.
223.68	"She was like, ""I don't know."
223.68	"They didn't fill out my survey."""
226.6	(Laughter)
229.12	No, here are our results.
231.88	You actually do see that the people
231.88	who wait until the last minute
235.84	are so busy goofing off
235.84	that they don't have any new ideas.
240.68	And on the flip side,
240.68	the people who race in
243.92	are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they
243.92	don't have original thoughts either.
249.4	There's a sweet spot
249.4	where originals seem to live.
253.88	Why is this?
255.52	Maybe original people
255.52	just have bad work habits.
258.44	Maybe procrastinating
258.44	does not cause creativity.
262.2	To find out, we designed some experiments.
265.44	We asked people
265.44	to generate new business ideas,
268.279	and then we get independent readers
270	to evaluate how creative
270	and useful they are.
273.2	And some of them are asked
273.2	to do the task right away.
276.64	Others we randomly assign
276.64	to procrastinate
279.2	by dangling Minesweeper in front of them
281.84	for either five or 10 minutes.
283.92	And sure enough,
283.92	the moderate procrastinators
287.08	are 16 percent more creative
287.08	than the other two groups.
291.6	Now, Minesweeper is awesome,
291.6	but it's not the driver of the effect,
294.8	because if you play the game first
294.8	before you learn about the task,
298	there's no creativity boost.
299.68	It's only when you're told that you're
299.68	going to be working on this problem,
303.24	and then you start procrastinating,
304.96	but the task is still active
304.96	in the back of your mind,
307.52	that you start to incubate.
309.04	Procrastination gives you time
309.04	to consider divergent ideas,
312.64	to think in nonlinear ways,
312.64	to make unexpected leaps.
316.72	So just as we were finishing
316.72	these experiments,
318.96	I was starting to write
318.96	a book about originals,
321.48	"and I thought, ""This is the perfect time"
321.48	to teach myself to procrastinate,
326.04	while writing a chapter
326.04	"on procrastination."""
328.72	So I metaprocrastinated,
332.12	and like any self-respecting
332.12	precrastinator,
335.52	I woke up early the next morning
337.12	and I made a to-do list
337.12	with steps on how to procrastinate.
339.96	(Laughter)
343.32	And then I worked diligently
347.08	toward my goal of not making
347.08	progress toward my goal.
352.16	I started writing
352.16	the procrastination chapter,
354.36	and one day -- I was halfway through --
356.28	I literally put it away in mid-sentence
358.2	for months.
359.56	It was agony.
362.64	But when I came back to it,
362.64	I had all sorts of new ideas.
366.56	As Aaron Sorkin put it,
367.92	"""You call it procrastinating."
367.92	"I call it thinking."""
372.2	And along the way I discovered
373.68	that a lot of great originals
373.68	in history were procrastinators.
377.68	Take Leonardo da Vinci.
379.48	He toiled on and off for 16 years
383.04	on the Mona Lisa.
384.84	He felt like a failure.
386.28	He wrote as much in his journal.
390.24	But some of the diversions
390.24	he took in optics
392.84	transformed the way that he modeled light
394.84	and made him into a much better painter.
397.76	What about Martin Luther King, Jr.?
400.48	The night before
400.48	the biggest speech of his life,
402.76	the March on Washington,
404.04	he was up past 3am, rewriting it.
406.8	He's sitting in the audience
406.8	waiting for his turn to go onstage,
410.24	and he is still scribbling notes
410.24	and crossing out lines.
414.76	When he gets onstage, 11 minutes in,
416.84	he leaves his prepared remarks
418.8	to utter four words
418.8	that changed the course of history:
421.96	"""I have a dream."""
424.08	That was not in the script.
427.08	By delaying the task of finalizing
427.08	the speech until the very last minute,
431.76	he left himself open
431.76	to the widest range of possible ideas.
435.52	And because the text wasn't set in stone,
437.8	he had freedom to improvise.
440.64	Procrastinating is a vice
440.64	when it comes to productivity,
443.84	but it can be a virtue for creativity.
447.4	What you see with a lot of great originals
449.44	is that they are quick to start
449.44	but they're slow to finish.
453.08	And this is what I missed
453.08	with Warby Parker.
455.72	When they were dragging
455.72	their heels for six months,
458.4	I looked at them and said,
460.04	"""You know, a lot of other companies"
460.04	"are starting to sell glasses online."""
463.52	They missed the first-mover advantage.
466.2	But what I didn't realize was
466.2	they were spending all that time
469.16	trying to figure out how to get people
471.04	to be comfortable ordering glasses online.
473.064	And it turns out the first-mover
473.064	advantage is mostly a myth.
476.08	Look at a classic study
476.08	of over 50 product categories,
479.92	comparing the first movers
479.92	who created the market
482.44	with the improvers who introduced
482.44	something different and better.
486.92	What you see is that the first movers
486.92	had a failure rate of 47 percent,
490.92	compared with only 8 percent
490.92	for the improvers.
495	Look at Facebook,
495	waiting to build a social network
497.56	until after Myspace and Friendster.
501.04	Look at Google, waiting for years
501.04	after Altavista and Yahoo.
504.84	It's much easier to improve
504.84	on somebody else's idea
507.96	than it is to create
507.96	something new from scratch.
510.88	So the lesson I learned is that
510.88	to be original you don't have to be first.
515	You just have to be different and better.
518.36	But that wasn't the only reason
518.36	I passed on Warby Parker.
521.36	They were also full of doubts.
523.8	They had backup plans lined up,
525.64	and that made me doubt
525.64	that they had the courage to be original,
529.08	because I expected that originals
529.08	would look something like this.
535.039	(Laughter)
538.68	Now, on the surface,
540.32	a lot of original people look confident,
542.32	but behind the scenes,
543.6	they feel the same fear and doubt
543.6	that the rest of us do.
546.64	They just manage it differently.
548.84	Let me show you: this is a depiction
550.6	of how the creative process
550.6	works for most of us.
556.12	(Laughter)
560.16	Now, in my research, I discovered
560.16	there are two different kinds of doubt.
563.64	There's self-doubt and idea doubt.
565.32	Self-doubt is paralyzing.
566.88	It leads you to freeze.
568.52	But idea doubt is energizing.
570.28	It motivates you to test,
570.28	to experiment, to refine,
573.08	just like MLK did.
575.16	And so the key to being original
578.44	is just a simple thing
580.2	of avoiding the leap
580.2	from step three to step four.
583.6	"Instead of saying, ""I'm crap,"""
585.44	"you say, ""The first few drafts"
585.44	are always crap,
588.68	"and I'm just not there yet."""
590.92	So how do you get there?
592.56	Well, there's a clue, it turns out,
594.48	in the Internet browser that you use.
597	We can predict your job performance
597	and your commitment
599.64	just by knowing what web browser you use.
603.44	Now, some of you are not
603.44	going to like the results of this study --
606.64	(Laughter)
608	But there is good evidence
608	that Firefox and Chrome users
611.96	significantly outperform
611.96	Internet Explorer and Safari users.
615.96	Yes.
617.32	(Applause)
619.2	They also stay in their jobs
623.12	Why? It's not a technical advantage.
625.32	The four browser groups
625.32	on average have similar typing speed
628.72	and they also have similar levels
628.72	of computer knowledge.
631.88	It's about how you got the browser.
634	Because if you use
634	Internet Explorer or Safari,
636.48	those came preinstalled on your computer,
639.04	and you accepted the default option
639.04	that was handed to you.
642.6	If you wanted Firefox or Chrome,
642.6	you had to doubt the default
645.64	and ask, is there
645.64	a different option out there,
647.92	and then be a little resourceful
647.92	and download a new browser.
651.76	So people hear about this study
651.76	and they're like,
654.12	"""Great, if I want to get better at my job,"
654.12	"I just need to upgrade my browser?"""
657.84	(Laughter)
658.88	No, it's about being the kind of person
661	who takes the initiative
661	to doubt the default
663.44	and look for a better option.
665.6	And if you do that well,
667.12	you will open yourself up
667.12	to the opposite of déjà vu.
670.6	There's a name for it.
670.6	It's called vuja de.
673.76	(Laughter)
676.8	Vuja de is when you look at something
676.8	you've seen many times before
680	and all of a sudden
680	see it with fresh eyes.
683.92	It's a screenwriter
683.92	who looks at a movie script
686.56	that can't get the green light
686.56	for more than half a century.
689.56	In every past version,
689.56	the main character has been an evil queen.
694.28	But Jennifer Lee starts to question
694.28	whether that makes sense.
697.44	She rewrites the first act,
698.92	reinvents the villain as a tortured hero
701.56	and Frozen becomes
701.56	the most successful animated movie ever.
705.6	So there's a simple message
705.6	from this story.
707.72	When you feel doubt, don't let it go.
710.68	(Laughter)
713.64	What about fear?
715	Originals feel fear, too.
717.6	They're afraid of failing,
719.48	but what sets them apart
719.48	from the rest of us
721.6	is that they're even more
721.6	afraid of failing to try.
724.24	They know you can fail
724.24	by starting a business that goes bankrupt
727.36	or by failing to start a business at all.
730.48	They know that in the long run,
730.48	our biggest regrets are not our actions
734.04	but our inactions.
735.72	The things we wish we could redo,
735.72	if you look at the science,
738.602	are the chances not taken.
741.72	Elon Musk told me recently,
741.72	he didn't expect Tesla to succeed.
745.4	He was sure the first few SpaceX launches
748.16	would fail to make it to orbit,
748.16	let alone get back,
751.36	but it was too important not to try.
754.36	And for so many of us,
754.36	when we have an important idea,
756.92	we don't bother to try.
758.96	But I have some good news for you.
761.04	You are not going to get judged
761.04	on your bad ideas.
763.64	A lot of people think they will.
765.28	If you look across industries
766.96	and ask people about their biggest idea,
766.96	their most important suggestion,
	instead of speaking up.
775.24	They were afraid of embarrassing
775.24	themselves, of looking stupid.
778.68	But guess what? Originals
778.68	have lots and lots of bad ideas,
782.12	tons of them, in fact.
784.56	Take the guy who invented this.
787.4	Do you care that he came up
787.4	with a talking doll so creepy
790.12	that it scared not only kids
790.12	but adults, too?
793.92	No. You celebrate Thomas Edison
793.92	for pioneering the light bulb.
798.28	(Laughter)
800.68	If you look across fields,
803.12	the greatest originals
803.12	are the ones who fail the most,
806.12	because they're the ones who try the most.
808.44	Take classical composers,
808.44	the best of the best.
811.44	Why do some of them get more pages
811.44	in encyclopedias than others
814.6	and also have their compositions
814.6	rerecorded more times?
818	One of the best predictors
819.32	is the sheer volume
819.32	of compositions that they generate.
823.24	The more output you churn out,
823.24	the more variety you get
826.36	and the better your chances
826.36	of stumbling on something truly original.
830.12	Even the three icons of classical music --
830.12	Bach, Beethoven, Mozart --
834.48	had to generate hundreds
834.48	and hundreds of compositions
837.52	to come up with a much smaller
837.52	number of masterpieces.
841.84	Now, you may be wondering,
843.4	how did this guy become great
843.4	without doing a whole lot?
847.52	I don't know how Wagner pulled that off.
850.76	But for most of us,
850.76	if we want to be more original,
853.4	we have to generate more ideas.
856.52	The Warby Parker founders, when they
856.52	were trying to name their company,
860.16	they needed something sophisticated,
860.16	unique, with no negative associations
863.68	to build a retail brand,
865.16	and they tested over 2,000 possibilities
867.64	before they finally put together
869.32	Warby and Parker.
872.04	So if you put all this together,
872.04	what you see is that originals
875.04	are not that different
875.04	from the rest of us.
877.72	They feel fear and doubt.
877.72	They procrastinate.
880.88	They have bad ideas.
882.92	And sometimes, it's not in spite
882.92	of those qualities but because of them
886.28	that they succeed.
888.04	So when you see those things,
888.04	don't make the same mistake I did.
891.12	Don't write them off.
892.4	And when that's you,
892.4	don't count yourself out either.
895.4	Know that being quick to start
895.4	but slow to finish
897.88	can boost your creativity,
899.52	that you can motivate yourself
899.52	by doubting your ideas
902.08	and embracing the fear of failing to try,
904.68	and that you need a lot of bad ideas
904.68	in order to get a few good ones.
908.88	Look, being original is not easy,
911.36	but I have no doubt about this:
913.32	it's the best way
913.32	to improve the world around us.
916.16	Thank you.
917.4	(Applause)
