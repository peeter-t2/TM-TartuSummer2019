16.527	Before March, 2011, I was a photographic retoucher
20.581	based in New York City.
23.528	We're pale, gray creatures.
25.584	We hide in dark, windowless rooms,
27.644	and generally avoid sunlight.
29.972	We make skinny models skinnier, perfect skin more perfect,
34.236	and the impossible possible,
36.216	and we get criticized in the press all the time,
40.266	but some of us are actually talented artists
43.767	with years of experience
45.847	and a real appreciation for images and photography.
49.751	On March 11, 2011, I watched from home, as the rest
54.915	of the world did, as the tragic events unfolded in Japan.
58.751	Soon after, an organization I volunteer with,
60.924	All Hands Volunteers, were on the ground, within days,
64.766	working as part of the response efforts.
67.598	I, along with hundreds of other volunteers,
69.894	knew we couldn't just sit at home,
71.558	so I decided to join them for three weeks.
75.282	On May the 13th, I made my way to the town of Ōfunato.
78.927	It's a small fishing town in Iwate Prefecture,
82.607	about 50,000 people,
85.014	one of the first that was hit by the wave.
87.819	The waters here have been recorded at reaching
90.63	over 24 meters in height,
93.332	and traveled over two miles inland.
95.041	As you can imagine, the town had been devastated.
98.583	We pulled debris from canals and ditches.
101.114	We cleaned schools. We de-mudded and gutted homes
104.545	ready for renovation and rehabilitation.
107.043	We cleared tons and tons of stinking, rotting fish carcasses
111.495	from the local fish processing plant.
113.714	We got dirty, and we loved it.
117.123	For weeks, all the volunteers and locals alike
120.24	had been finding similar things.
122.48	They'd been finding photos and photo albums
125.426	and cameras and SD cards.
128.059	And everyone was doing the same.
129.275	They were collecting them up, and handing them in to
131.94	various places around the different towns for safekeeping.
135.113	Now, it wasn't until this point that I realized
138.229	that these photos were such a huge part
140.659	of the personal loss these people had felt.
143.659	As they had run from the wave, and for their lives,
146.453	absolutely everything they had,
148.973	everything had to be left behind.
151.797	At the end of my first week there, I found myself
154.082	helping out in an evacuation center in the town.
157.276	I was helping clean the onsen, the communal onsen,
160.611	the huge giant bathtubs.
162.917	This happened to also be a place in the town where
165.354	the evacuation center was collecting the photos.
168.358	This is where people were handing them in,
170.283	and I was honored that day that they actually trusted me
172.791	to help them start hand-cleaning them.
175.435	Now, it was emotional and it was inspiring,
178.484	and I've always heard about thinking outside the box,
182.242	but it wasn't until I had actually gotten outside of my box
185.653	that something happened.
188.08	As I looked through the photos, there were some
190.133	were over a hundred years old,
191.899	some still in the envelope from the processing lab,
195.483	I couldn't help but think as a retoucher
197.373	that I could fix that tear and mend that scratch,
200.198	and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same.
204.235	So that evening, I just reached out on Facebook
206.622	and asked a few of them, and by morning
208.816	the response had been so overwhelming and so positive,
212.295	I knew we had to give it a go.
214.16	So we started retouching photos.
217.014	This was the very first.
219.807	Not terribly damaged, but where the water had caused
224.414	that discoloration on the girl's face
226.6	had to be repaired with such accuracy and delicacy.
230.203	Otherwise, that little girl isn't going to look
232.498	like that little girl anymore, and surely that's as tragic
235.198	as having the photo damaged.
238.742	(Applause)
245.07	Over time, more photos came in, thankfully,
248.283	and more retouchers were needed,
251.757	and so I reached out again on Facebook and LinkedIn,
254.695	and within five days, 80 people wanted to help
257.778	from 12 different countries.
259.747	Within two weeks, I had 150 people
262.116	wanting to join in.
263.987	Within Japan, by July, we'd branched out
266.363	to the neighboring town of Rikuzentakata,
268.975	further north to a town called Yamada.
271.369	Once a week, we would set up our scanning equipment
274.637	in the temporary photo libraries that had been set up,
277.145	where people were reclaiming their photos.
279.518	The older ladies sometimes hadn't seen a scanner before,
283.35	but within 10 minutes of them finding their lost photo,
287.224	they could give it to us, have it scanned,
289.133	uploaded to a cloud server, it would be downloaded
291.147	by a gaijin, a stranger,
293.78	somewhere on the other side of the globe,
295.883	and it'd start being fixed.
298.247	The time it took, however, to get it back
301.385	is a completely different story,
303.432	and it depended obviously on the damage involved.
306.02	It could take an hour. It could take weeks.
307.753	It could take months.
309.857	The kimono in this shot pretty much had to be hand-drawn,
313.974	or pieced together, picking out the remaining parts of color
317.676	and detail that the water hadn't damaged.
320.106	It was very time-consuming.
322.851	Now, all these photos had been damaged by water,
325.472	submerged in salt water, covered in bacteria,
328.803	in sewage, sometimes even in oil, all of which over time
332.244	is going to continue to damage them,
334.188	so hand-cleaning them was a huge part of the project.
337.304	We couldn't retouch the photo unless it was cleaned,
340.274	dry and reclaimed.
343.29	Now, we were lucky with our hand-cleaning.
345.742	We had an amazing local woman who guided us.
348.979	It's very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos.
353.172	As my team leader Wynne once said,
354.957	it's like doing a tattoo on someone.
356.903	You don't get a chance to mess it up.
360.434	The lady who brought us these photos was lucky,
363.417	as far as the photos go.
365.647	She had started hand-cleaning them herself and stopped
368.029	when she realized she was doing more damage.
370.448	She also had duplicates.
372.699	Areas like her husband and her face, which otherwise
375.792	would have been completely impossible to fix,
377.896	we could just put them together in one good photo,
380.754	and remake the whole photo.
383.206	When she collected the photos from us,
385.884	she shared a bit of her story with us.
388.247	Her photos were found by her husband's colleagues
391.207	at a local fire department in the debris
393.197	a long way from where the home had once stood,
396.313	and they'd recognized him.
398.488	The day of the tsunami, he'd actually been in charge
400.769	of making sure the tsunami gates were closed.
403.296	He had to go towards the water as the sirens sounded.
406.424	Her two little boys, not so little anymore, but her two boys
409.866	were both at school, separate schools.
412.056	One of them got caught up in the water.
414.624	It took her a week to find them all again
416.571	and find out that they had all survived.
418.968	The day I gave her the photos also happened to be
421.898	her youngest son's 14th birthday.
425.841	For her, despite all of this, those photos
429.514	were the perfect gift back to him,
432.225	something he could look at again, something he remembered from before
435.33	that wasn't still scarred from that day in March
439.588	when absolutely everything else in his life had changed
442.403	or been destroyed.
446.552	After six months in Japan,
448.409	1,100 volunteers had passed through All Hands,
451.559	hundreds of whom had helped us hand-clean
453.809	over 135,000 photographs,
457.049	the large majority — (Applause) —
462.753	a large majority of which did actually find their home again,
465.983	importantly.
468.738	Over five hundred volunteers around the globe
471.911	helped us get 90 families hundreds of photographs back,
476.569	fully restored and retouched.
478.819	During this time, we hadn't really spent more than
481.272	about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials,
484.118	most of which was printer inks.
487.448	We take photos constantly.
490.335	A photo is a reminder of someone or something,
492.904	a place, a relationship, a loved one.
495.762	They're our memory-keepers and our histories,
498.271	the last thing we would grab
500.983	and the first thing you'd go back to look for.
503.491	That's all this project was about,
505.595	about restoring those little bits of humanity,
509.026	giving someone that connection back.
511.138	When a photo like this can be returned to someone like this,
516.831	it makes a huge difference
518.915	in the lives of the person receiving it.
521.7	The project's also made a big difference in the lives of the retouchers.
525.503	For some of them, it's given them a connection
528.574	to something bigger, giving something back,
531.106	using their talents on something
532.985	other than skinny models and perfect skin.
536.405	I would like to conclude by reading an email
539.018	I got from one of them, Cindy,
541.448	the day I finally got back from Japan after six months.
546.05	"""As I worked, I couldn't help but think about the individuals"
549.805	and the stories represented in the images.
552.954	One in particular, a photo of women of all ages,
556.441	from grandmother to little girl, gathered around a baby,
560.817	struck a chord, because a similar photo from my family,
564.339	my grandmother and mother, myself,
566.791	and newborn daughter, hangs on our wall.
570.2	Across the globe, throughout the ages,
573.354	"our basic needs are just the same, aren't they?"""
577.243	Thank you. (Applause)
579.56	(Applause)
