12.872	This is a man-made forest.
15.88	It can spread over acres
15.88	and acres of area,
19.121	or it could fit in a small space --
22.387	as small as your house garden.
27.327	Each of these forests
27.327	is just two years old.
31.298	I have a forest in the backyard
31.298	of my own house.
35.036	It attracts a lot of biodiversity.
37.582	(Bird call)
42.229	I wake up to this every morning,
43.798	like a Disney princess.
45.321	(Laughter)
47.164	I am an entrepreneur
48.394	who facilitates the making
48.394	of these forests professionally.
52.798	We have helped factories,
54.746	farms,
55.927	schools,
58.287	homes,
60.306	resorts,
62.273	apartment buildings,
64.891	public parks
66.854	and even a zoo
68.221	to have one of such forests.
70.715	A forest is not an isolated piece of land
70.715	where animals live together.
76.035	A forest can be an integral part
76.035	of our urban existence.
82.212	A forest, for me,
83.57	is a place so dense with trees
83.57	that you just can't walk into it.
87.54	It doesn't matter
87.54	how big or small they are.
91.046	Most of the world
91.046	we live in today was forest.
94.453	This was before human intervention.
96.865	Then we built up our cities
96.865	on those forests,
99.177	like SÃ£o Paulo,
100.701	forgetting that we belong
100.701	to nature as well,
103.494	as much as 8.4 million
103.494	other species on the planet.
108.215	Our habitat stopped being
108.215	our natural habitat.
112.19	But not anymore for some of us.
114.647	A few others and I today make
114.647	these forests professionally --
118.266	anywhere and everywhere.
121.368	I'm an industrial engineer.
123.258	I specialize in making cars.
126.078	In my previous job at Toyota,
128.278	I learned how to convert
128.278	natural resources into products.
133.125	To give you an example,
134.331	we would drip the sap
134.331	out of a rubber tree,
137.006	convert it into raw rubber
138.689	and make a tire out of it -- the product.
141.418	But these products can never
141.418	become a natural resource again.
145.272	We separate the elements from nature
148.269	and convert them
148.269	into an irreversible state.
151.529	That's industrial production.
154.025	Nature, on the other hand,
154.025	works in a totally opposite way.
157.91	The natural system produces
157.91	by bringing elements together,
161.919	atom by atom.
164.336	All the natural products
164.336	become a natural resource again.
170.343	This is something which I learned
173.309	when I made a forest
173.309	in the backyard of my own house.
176.371	And this was the first time
176.371	I worked with nature,
179.671	rather than against it.
181.894	Since then,
183.094	we have made 75 such forests
183.094	in 25 cities across the world.
189.678	Every time we work at a new place,
191.824	we find that every single element
191.824	needed to make a forest
196.592	is available right around us.
198.666	All we have to do is to bring
198.666	these elements together
201.371	and let nature take over.
205.1	To make a forest we start with soil.
208.125	We touch, feel and even taste it
210.589	to identify what properties it lacks.
213.68	If the soil is made up of small particles
213.68	it becomes compact --
216.746	so compact, that water cannot seep in.
220.188	We mix some local biomass
220.188	available around,
224.66	which can help soil become more porous.
229.04	Water can now seep in.
231.359	If the soil doesn't have
231.359	the capacity to hold water,
235.882	we will mix some more biomass --
237.581	some water-absorbent material
237.581	like peat or bagasse,
240.879	so soil can hold this water
240.879	and it stays moist.
245.68	To grow, plants need water,
245.68	sunlight and nutrition.
251.047	What if the soil doesn't have
251.047	any nutrition in it?
254.383	We don't just add nutrition
254.383	directly to the soil.
256.733	That would be the industrial way.
258.369	It goes against nature.
259.819	We instead add microorganisms to the soil.
262.927	They produce the nutrients
262.927	in the soil naturally.
266.886	They feed on the biomass
266.886	we have mixed in the soil,
269.499	so all they have to do
269.499	is eat and multiply.
272.222	And as their number grows,
274.197	the soil starts breathing again.
275.769	It becomes alive.
278.215	We survey the native
278.215	tree species of the place.
280.866	How do we decide what's native or not?
283.473	Well, whatever existed
283.473	before human intervention is native.
287.955	That's the simple rule.
289.949	We survey a national park
294.47	to find the last remains
294.47	of a natural forest.
298.689	We survey the sacred groves,
301.714	or sacred forests around old temples.
304.973	And if we don't find anything at all,
307.276	we go to museums
308.824	to see the seeds or wood of trees
308.824	existing there a long time ago.
314.547	We research old paintings,
314.547	poems and literature from the place,
320.068	to identify the tree species
320.068	belonging there.
323.217	Once we know our trees,
324.587	we divide them in four different layers:
326.529	shrub layer, sub-tree layer,
326.529	tree layer and canopy layer.
330.475	We fix the ratios of each layer,
333.016	and then we decide the percentage
333.016	of each tree species in the mix.
338.506	If we are making a fruit forest,
340.363	we increase the percentage
340.363	of fruit-bearing trees.
343.446	It could be a flowering forest,
346.145	a forest that attracts
346.145	a lot of birds or bees,
350.026	or it could simply be a native,
350.026	wild evergreen forest.
355.56	We collect the seeds
355.56	and germinate saplings out of them.
359.011	We make sure that trees
359.011	belonging to the same layer
361.999	are not planted next to each other,
363.873	or they will fight for the same
363.873	vertical space when they grow tall.
367.224	We plant the saplings close to each other.
370.548	On the surface, we spread
370.548	a thick layer of mulch,
373.637	so when it's hot outside
373.637	the soil stays moist.
376.605	When it's cold,
378.341	frost formation happens only on the mulch,
381.582	so soil can still breathe
381.582	while it's freezing outside.
385.497	The soil is very soft --
388.69	so soft, that roots
388.69	can penetrate into it easily,
392.208	rapidly.
394.064	Initially, the forest doesn't
394.064	seem like it's growing,
396.573	but it's growing under the surface.
398.746	In the first three months,
400.231	roots reach a depth of one meter.
402.736	These roots form a mesh,
404.644	tightly holding the soil.
406.397	Microbes and fungi live
406.397	throughout this network of roots.
410.706	So if some nutrition is not available
410.706	in the vicinity of a tree,
414.317	these microbes are going to get
414.317	the nutrition to the tree.
417.754	Whenever it rains,
419.502	magically,
420.686	mushrooms appear overnight.
422.573	And this means the soil below
422.573	has a healthy fungal network.
426.663	Once these roots are established,
428.954	forest starts growing on the surface.
431.835	As the forest grows we keep watering it --
436.226	for the next two to three years,
436.226	we water the forest.
440.752	We want to keep all the water
440.752	and soil nutrition only for our trees,
445.832	so we remove the weeds
445.832	growing on the ground.
448.971	As this forest grows,
448.971	it blocks the sunlight.
452.801	Eventually, the forest becomes so dense
455.271	that sunlight can't reach
455.271	the ground anymore.
457.902	Weeds cannot grow now,
457.902	because they need sunlight as well.
462.044	At this stage,
463.347	every single drop of water
463.347	that falls into the forest
466.568	doesn't evaporate back
466.568	into the atmosphere.
469.327	This dense forest condenses the moist air
472.439	and retains its moisture.
474.712	We gradually reduce and eventually
474.712	stop watering the forest.
479.34	And even without watering,
480.882	the forest floor stays moist
480.882	and sometimes even dark.
485.97	Now, when a single leaf
485.97	falls on this forest floor,
489.394	it immediately starts decaying.
492.317	This decayed biomass forms humus,
495.527	which is food for the forest.
497.53	As the forest grows,
499.233	more leaves fall on the surface --
500.927	it means more humus is produced,
502.983	it means more food so the forest
502.983	can grow still bigger.
506.245	And this forest keeps
506.245	growing exponentially.
510.053	Once established,
511.493	these forests are going to regenerate
511.493	themselves again and again --
515.707	probably forever.
518.209	In a natural forest like this,
520.679	no management is the best management.
524.493	It's a tiny jungle party.
526.308	(Laughter)
528.663	This forest grows as a collective.
531.627	If the same trees --
532.969	same species --
534.27	would have been planted independently,
536.532	it wouldn't grow so fast.
538.503	And this is how we create
538.503	a 100-year-old forest
542.711	in just 10 years.
544.044	Thank you very much.
545.222	(Applause)
