26.396	I'm often asked,
28.848	"""What surprised you about the book?"""
31.32	"And I say, ""That I got to write it."""
33.501	I would have never imagined that.
36.33	Not in my wildest dreams did I think --
38.904	I don't even consider
38.904	myself to be an author.
42.289	And I'm often asked,
44.511	"""Why do you think so many"
44.511	people have read this?
47	This thing's selling still
47	"about a million copies a month."""
52	And I think it's because
52	spiritual emptiness
57	is a universal disease.
59.912	I think inside at some point, we put
59.912	our heads down on the pillow and we go,
63.553	"""There's got to be more"
63.553	"to life than this."""
66.192	Get up in the morning, go to work,
66.192	come home and watch TV,
68.957	go to bed, get up in the morning, go
68.957	to work, come home, watch TV, go to bed,
72.641	go to parties on weekends.
75.283	"A lot of people say, ""I'm living."" No,"
75.283	you're not living -- that's just existing.
79.994	Just existing.
81.537	I really think that
81.537	there's this inner desire.
85.331	I do believe what Chris said;
85.331	I believe that you're not an accident.
90.728	Your parents may not have planned you,
90.728	but I believe God did.
94.202	I think there are accidental parents;
94.202	there's no doubt about that.
97.457	I don't think there are accidental kids.
100.698	And I think you matter.
103.536	I think you matter to God;
103.536	I think you matter to history;
106.577	I think you matter to this universe.
109.949	And I think that the difference
112.196	between what I call the survival level
112.196	of living, the success level of living,
117	and the significance level of living is:
119	Do you figure out,
119	"""What on Earth am I here for?"""
122.524	I meet a lot of people who are very smart,
125.918	"and say, ""But why can't I"
125.918	"figure out my problems?"""
129	And I meet a lot of people
129	who are very successful,
131.665	"who say, ""Why don't I feel more fulfilled?"
134.379	Why do I feel like a fake?
137	Why do I feel like I've got to pretend
137	"that I'm more than I really am?"""
143.562	I think that comes down to this issue
143.562	of meaning, of significance, of purpose.
147.896	I think it comes down to this issue of:
150.375	"""Why am I here? What am I here for?"
150.375	"Where am I going?"""
153.938	These are not religious issues.
156.779	They're human issues.
160	I wanted to tell Michael before he spoke
160	that I really appreciate what he does,
164	because it makes my life work
164	a whole lot easier.
167.174	As a pastor, I do see a lot of kooks.
171.396	And I have learned that there are
171.396	kooks in every area of life.
175.444	Religion doesn't have a monopoly on that,
179.796	but there are plenty of religious kooks.
181.857	There are secular kooks;
181.857	there are smart kooks, dumb kooks.
185.268	There are people -- a lady
185.268	came up to me the other day,
187.903	and she had a white piece of paper --
187.903	Michael, you'll like this one --
191.242	"and she said, ""What do you see in it?"""
193.092	And I looked at it and I said,
193.092	"""Oh, I don't see anything."""
195.856	"And she goes, ""Well, I see Jesus,"""
195.856	and started crying and left.
198.852	"I'm going, ""OK,"" you know? ""Fine."""
203.38	(Laughter)
205.564	Good for you.
209.45	When the book became the best-selling book
209.45	in the world for the last three years,
213.355	I kind of had my little crisis.
216.386	And that was: What is the purpose of this?
220.771	Because it brought in
220.771	enormous amounts of money.
223.58	When you write the best-selling
223.58	book in the world,
226.025	it's tons and tons of money.
228.894	And it brought in a lot of attention,
228.894	neither of which I wanted.
232.193	When I started Saddleback Church,
232.193	I was 25 years old.
235.609	I started it with
235.609	one other family in 1980.
240.674	And I decided that I was never
240.674	going to go on TV,
243	because I didn't want to be a celebrity.
244.946	I didn't want to be a, quote,
244.946	"""evangelist, televangelist"" --"
248.151	that's not my thing.
250.896	And all of the sudden, it brought a lot
250.896	of money and a lot of attention.
255.194	I don't think --
256.758	now, this is a worldview,
258.023	and I will tell you,
258.023	everybody's got a worldview.
261.037	Everybody's betting
261.037	their life on something.
263.12	You're betting your life on something,
264.981	you just better know why
264.981	you're betting what you're betting on.
268.409	So, everybody's betting
268.409	their life on something.
271.658	And when I, you know, made a bet,
275.644	I happened to believe
275.644	that Jesus was who he said he was.
279.159	And I believe in a pluralistic society,
282.142	everybody's betting on something.
285.404	And when I started the church,
288.526	you know, I had no plans
288.526	to do what it's doing now.
293.171	And then when I wrote this book,
295.052	and all of a sudden, it just took off,
299.601	and I started saying, now,
299.601	what's the purpose of this?
302.212	Because as I started to say,
303.957	I don't think you're given money or fame
306.177	for your own ego, ever.
309.511	I just don't believe that.
311.371	And when you write a book
311.371	that the first sentence of the book is,
314.582	"""It's not about you,"""
317.028	then, when all of a sudden it becomes
317.028	the best-selling book in history,
320.432	you've got to figure, well,
320.432	I guess it's not about me.
323.664	That's kind of a no-brainer.
326.251	So, what is it for?
328.743	And I began to think about what I call
328.743	"the ""stewardship of affluence"""
332.373	"and the ""stewardship of influence."""
335.434	So I believe, essentially,
335.434	leadership is stewardship.
339	That if you are a leader in any area --
341.449	in business, in politics,
341.449	in sports, in art,
344.989	in academics, in any area --
347.081	you don't own it.
349.764	You are a steward of it.
351.909	For instance, that's why I believe
351.909	in protecting the environment.
355.004	This is not my planet.
356.588	It wasn't mine before I was born,
356.588	it's not going to be mine after I die,
360.075	I'm just here for 80 years
360.075	and then that's it.
363.27	I was debating
363.27	the other day on a talk show,
367.391	and the guy was challenging
367.391	me and he'd go,
369.428	"""What's a pastor doing"
369.428	"on protecting the environment?"""
372.856	And I asked this guy, I said,
372.856	"""Well, do you believe"
376.657	that human beings are responsible
380.564	to make the world a little bit better
380.564	place for the next generation?
384.349	Do you think we have a stewardship here,
384.349	"to take the environment seriously?"""
389.334	"And he said, ""No."""
391.285	"I said, ""Oh, you don't?"""
392.463	"I said, ""Let me make this clear again:"
394.312	Do you believe that as human beings --
394.312	I'm not talking about religion --
398.282	do you believe that as human beings,
398.282	it is our responsibility
401.178	to take care of this planet,
402.544	and make it just a little bit better
402.544	"for the next generation?"""
405.491	"And he said, ""No. Not any more"
405.491	"than any other species."""
410.2	"When he said the word ""species,"""
410.2	he was revealing his worldview.
414.382	And he was saying,
415.6	"""I'm no more responsible to take care"
415.6	"of this environment than a duck is."""
420.887	Well now, I know a lot
420.887	of times we act like ducks,
423.501	but you're not a duck.
425.635	You're not a duck.
427.543	And you are responsible --
427.543	that's my worldview.
431.397	And so, you need to understand
431.397	what your worldview is.
435.696	The problem is most people
435.696	never really think it through.
439.783	They never really ...
443.746	codify it or qualify it or quantify it,
447.103	"and say, ""This is what I believe in."
447.103	"This is why I believe what I believe."""
451.209	I don't personally have
451.209	enough faith to be an atheist.
455.159	But you may, you may.
458	Your worldview, though, does determine
458	everything else in your life,
462.113	because it determines your decisions;
464.859	it determines your relationships;
467.272	it determines your level of confidence.
470.082	It determines, really,
470.082	everything in your life.
473.277	What we believe, obviously --
475.078	and you know this --
475.078	determines our behavior,
477.809	and our behavior determines
477.809	what we become in life.
483.912	So all of this money started pouring in,
486	and all of this fame started pouring in.
490	And I'm going, what do I do with this?
493.539	My wife and I first made five decisions
493.539	on what to do with the money.
498.081	"We said, ""First, we're not"
498.081	"going to use it on ourselves."""
502.75	I didn't go out and buy a bigger house.
505.099	I don't own a guesthouse.
506.898	I still drive the same four year-old
506.898	Ford that I've driven.
510.619	We just said, we're not
510.619	going to use it on us.
513.659	The second thing was,
516.354	I stopped taking a salary
516.354	from the church that I pastor.
520.282	Third thing is, I added up
520.282	all that the church had paid me
523.045	over the last 25 years,
523.045	and I gave it back.
526.71	And I gave it back because
526.71	I didn't want anybody thinking
529.424	that I do what I do for money -- I don't.
531.756	In fact, personally, I've never met
535.424	a priest or a pastor or a minister
535.424	who does it for money.
538.84	I know that's the stereotype;
538.84	I've never met one of them.
541.919	Believe me, there's a whole lot
541.919	easier ways to make money.
545.763	Pastors are like on 24 hours-a-day call,
545.763	they're like doctors.
549.605	I left late today -- I'd hoped
549.605	to be here yesterday --
553.073	because my father-in-law
553.073	is in his last, probably, 48 hours
556.547	before he dies of cancer.
558.286	And I'm watching a guy
558.286	who's lived his life --
561	he's now in his mid-80s --
561	and he's dying with peace.
564.98	You know, the test of your worldview
564.98	is not how you act in the good times.
570.555	The test of your worldview
570.555	is how you act at the funeral.
575.352	And having been through literally
575.352	hundreds if not thousands of funerals,
579.394	it makes a difference.
581.171	It makes a difference what you believe.
584.509	So, we gave it all back,
588.398	and then we set up three foundations,
591.26	working on some of the major
591.26	problems of the world:
593.681	illiteracy, poverty, pandemic diseases --
593.681	particularly HIV/AIDS --
599.555	and set up these three foundations,
599.555	and put the money into that.
603.757	The last thing we did is we became
603.757	"what I call ""reverse tithers."""
607.535	And that is, when my wife
607.535	and I got married 30 years ago,
615.071	we started tithing.
617.939	Now, that's a principle in the Bible
620.052	that says give 10 percent
620.052	of what you get back to charity,
623.159	give it away to help other people.
625.865	So, we started doing that, and each year
625.865	we would raise our tithe one percent.
629.885	So, our first year of marriage
629.885	we went to 11 percent,
632.407	second year we went to 12 percent,
634.068	and the third year we went to 13 percent,
636.838	and on and on and on.
639.339	Why did I do that?
640.569	Because every time I give,
642.185	it breaks the grip
642.185	of materialism in my life.
646.217	Materialism is all about getting --
646.217	get, get, get, get all you can,
650.845	can all you get, sit on the can
650.845	and spoil the rest.
654.599	It's all about more, having more.
658.539	And we think that the good life
658.539	is actually looking good --
662.658	that's most important of all --
664.173	looking good, feeling good
664.173	and having the goods.
668.754	But that's not the good life.
670.532	I meet people all the time who have
670.532	those, and they're not necessarily happy.
674.768	If money actually made you happy,
677	then the wealthiest people
677	in the world would be the happiest.
679.977	And that I know, personally,
679.977	I know, is not true.
682.883	It's just not true.
685	So, the good life is not about looking
685	good, feeling good or having the goods,
688.855	it's about being good and doing good.
692.102	Giving your life away.
694.579	Significance in life
694.579	doesn't come from status,
698.271	because you can always find
698.271	somebody who's got more than you.
701.178	It doesn't come from sex.
702.718	It doesn't come from salary.
705.304	It comes from serving.
707.658	It is in giving our lives away
707.658	that we find meaning,
710.403	we find significance.
712.49	That's the way we were wired,
712.49	I believe, by God.
717	And so we began to give away,
720	and now after 30 years,
722	my wife and I are reverse tithers --
722	we give away 90 percent and live on 10.
727.055	That, actually, was the easy part.
728.949	The hard part is, what do I do
728.949	with all this attention?
732.162	Because I started getting
732.162	all kinds of invitations.
735.327	I just came off a nearly
735.327	month-long speaking tour
739.288	on three different continents,
741.117	and I won't go into that,
743.831	but it was an amazing thing.
746.452	And I'm going, what do I do
746.452	with this notoriety
750.347	that the book has brought?
752.801	And, being a pastor,
752.801	I started reading the Bible.
756.61	There's a chapter in the Bible
756.61	called Psalm 72,
759.403	and it's Solomon's prayer
759.403	for more influence.
763.172	When you read this prayer,
765	it sounds incredibly
765	selfish, self-centered.
769.023	"He says, ""God, I want you"
769.023	"to make me famous."""
771.583	That's what he prays.
773.047	"He said, ""I want you to make me famous."
774.938	I want you to spread the fame
774.938	of my name through every land,
777.795	I want you to give me power.
781.13	I want you to make me famous,
781.13	"I want you to give me influence."""
784.769	And it just sounds like the most
784.769	egotistical request you could make,
788.024	if you were going to pray.
790.444	Until you read the whole psalm,
790.444	the whole chapter.
793.117	And then he says,
793.117	"""So that the king ..."" --"
795.759	he was the king of Israel
795.759	at that time, at its apex in power --
800.57	"""... so that the king may care"
800.57	for the widow and orphan,
804.333	support the oppressed, defend
804.333	the defenseless, care for the sick,
808.361	assist the poor,
808.361	speak up for the foreigner,
812	"those in prison."""
814	Basically, he's talking about
814	all the marginalized in society.
817.757	And as I read that,
819.37	I looked at it, and I thought, you know,
822.824	what this is saying is that the purpose
822.824	of influence is to speak up
826.795	for those who have no influence.
830.763	The purpose of influence
830.763	is not to build your ego.
835.992	Or your net worth.
837.168	And, by the way, your net worth is not
837.168	the same thing as your self-worth.
840.844	Your value is not based on your valuables.
846	It's based on a whole
846	different set of things.
848.732	And so the purpose
848.732	of influence is to speak up
851.861	for those who have no influence.
853.425	And I had to admit:
855.363	I can't think of the last time
855.363	I thought of widows and orphans.
858.413	They're not on my radar.
861.261	I pastor a church in one of the most
861.261	affluent areas of America --
864.473	a bunch of gated communities.
866.354	I have a church full
866.354	of CEOs and scientists.
870.64	And I could go five years and never,
870.64	ever see a homeless person.
875	They're just not in my pathway.
877.379	Now, they're 13 miles
877.379	up the road in Santa Ana.
881.867	So I had to say, ok,
884	I would use whatever affluence
884	and whatever influence I've got
887.809	to help those who don't have
887.809	either of those.
892.61	You know, there's a story
892.61	in the Bible about Moses,
895.365	whether you believe it's true or not,
895.365	it really doesn't matter to me.
898.968	But Moses, if you saw the movie,
898.968	"""The Ten Commandments,"""
901.632	Moses goes out, and there's this
901.632	burning bush, and God talks to him,
904.939	and God says,
904.939	"""Moses, what's in your hand?"""
910.261	I think that's one of the most important
910.261	questions you'll ever be asked:
914.126	What's in your hand?
916.416	"Moses says, ""It's a staff."
916.416	"It's a shepherd's staff."""
921	"And God says, ""Throw it down."""
922.89	And if you saw the movie, you know,
922.89	he throws it down and it becomes a snake.
929.23	"And then God says, ""Pick it up."""
932.152	And he picks it back up again,
934	and it becomes a staff again.
937.357	Now, I'm reading this thing,
937.357	and I'm going, what is that all about?
941.143	OK. What's that all about? Well,
941.143	I do know a couple of things.
944.48	Number one, God never does
944.48	a miracle to show off.
948.091	"It's not just, ""Wow, isn't that cool?"""
950.158	And, by the way, my God doesn't
950.158	have to show up on cheese bread.
953.881	You know, if God's going to show up,
953.881	he's not going to show up on cheese bread.
957.8	(Laughter)
959.017	Ok? I just, this is why I love
959.017	what Michael does,
961.916	because it's like, if he's debunking it,
961.916	then I don't have to.
966.598	But God -- my God --
966.598	doesn't show up on sprinkler images.
970.76	He's got a few more powerful ways
970.76	than that to do whatever he wants to do.
975	But he doesn't do miracles
975	just to show off.
978.106	Second thing is,
978.106	if God ever asks you a question,
980.429	he already knows the answer.
982.682	Obviously, if he's God,
982.682	then that would mean
984.923	that when he asks the question,
984.923	it's for your benefit, not his.
988.627	"So he's going, ""What's in your hand?"""
990.512	Now, what was in Moses' hand?
992	Well, it was a shepherd's staff.
992	Now, follow me on this.
996.037	This staff represented
996.037	three things about Moses' life.
999.466	First, it represented his identity;
999.466	he was a shepherd.
1003.029	It's the symbol of his own occupation:
1006.352	I am a shepherd.
1008.219	It's a symbol of his identity,
1008.219	his career, his job.
1011.369	Second, it's a symbol
1011.369	of not only his identity,
1014.543	it's a symbol of his income, because all
1014.543	of his assets are tied up in sheep.
1018.722	In those days, nobody had bank accounts,
1018.722	or American Express cards, or hedge funds.
1023.143	Your assets are tied up in your flocks.
1026.277	So it's a symbol of his identity,
1026.277	and it's a symbol of his income.
1029.983	And the third thing:
1029.983	it's a symbol of his influence.
1033.348	What do you do with a shepherd's staff?
1036.679	Well, you know, you move sheep
1036.679	from point A to point B with it,
1040.456	by hook or by crook.
1042.121	You pull them or you poke them.
1042.121	One or the other.
1046.405	So, he's saying,
1048.357	"""You're going to lay down your identity."
1050.42	What's in your hand?
1051.599	You've got identity, you've got income,
1051.599	you've got influence.
1054.496	"What's in your hand?"""
1056.498	"And he's saying, ""If you lay it down,"
1056.498	I'll make it come alive.
1059.451	I'll do some things
1059.451	"you could never imagine possible."""
1062.05	And if you've watched that movie,
1062.05	"""Ten Commandments,"""
1064.568	all of those big miracles that happen
1064.568	in Egypt are done through this staff.
1071.152	Last year, I was invited to speak
1071.152	at the NBA All-Stars game.
1076.94	And so, I'm talking to the players,
1080	because most of the NBA teams,
1080	NFL teams and all the other teams
1084.325	have done this 40 Days of Purpose,
1084.325	based on the book.
1087.508	And I asked them, I said,
1087.508	"""What's in your hand?"
1092.392	"So, what's in your hand?"""
1092.392	"I said, ""It's a basketball."
1096.411	And that basketball represents
1096.411	your identity, who you are:
1100.152	you're an NBA player.
1101.65	It represents your income:
1103.246	you're making a lot of money
1103.246	off that little ball.
1106.182	And it represents your influence.
1108.645	And even though you're only going
1108.645	to be in the NBA for a few years,
1111.976	you're going to be an NBA player
1111.976	for the rest of your life.
1114.787	And that gives you enormous influence.
1117.254	So, what are you going to do
1117.254	"with what you've been given?"""
1121.785	And I guess that's the main reason
1121.785	I came up here today,
1126.298	to all of you very bright people at TED --
1129.251	"it is to say, ""What's in your hand?"""
1133.156	What do you have that you've been given?
1137.606	Talent, background, education,
1141	freedom, networks, opportunities,
1145.183	wealth, ideas, creativity.
1148.75	What are you doing
1148.75	with what you've been given?
1152.823	That, to me, is the primary
1152.823	question about life.
1156.737	That, to me, is what being
1156.737	purpose-driven is all about.
1160.999	In the book, I talk about
1160.999	how you're wired to do certain things,
1164.227	"you're ""SHAPED"" with -- a little acrostic:"
1164.227	Spiritual gifts, Heart,
1167.92	Ability, Personality and Experiences.
1170.332	These things shape you.
1172.42	And if you want to know what you ought
1172.42	to be doing with your life,
1175.568	you need to look at your shape --
1175.568	"""What am I wired to do?"""
1178.329	Why would God wire you to do something
1178.329	and then not have you do it?
1181.671	If you're wired to be an anthropologist,
1181.671	you'll be an anthropologist.
1184.943	If you're wired to be
1184.943	an undersea explorer,
1186.975	you'll be an undersea explorer.
1188.491	If you're wired to make deals,
1188.491	you make deals.
1190.681	If you're wired to paint, you paint.
1193.355	Did you know that God smiles
1193.355	when you be you?
1197.574	When my little kids --
1197.574	when my kids were little --
1199.945	they're all grown now, I have grandkids --
1201.976	I used to go in and sit
1201.976	on the side of their bed,
1204.312	and I used to watch my kids sleep.
1207.152	And I just watched their little bodies
1207.152	rise and lower, rise and lower.
1212.622	And I would look at them:
1212.622	"""This is not an accident."""
1215.501	Rise and lower.
1218.247	And I got joy out of just
1218.247	watching them sleep.
1224	Some people have the misguided idea
1224	that God only gets excited
1227.591	when you're doing, quote,
1227.591	"""spiritual things,"""
1229.735	like going to church or helping the poor,
1232.472	or, you know, confessing
1232.472	or doing something like that.
1236.42	The bottom line is, God gets pleasure
1236.42	watching you be you.
1240.802	Why? He made you.
1242.89	And when you do what you were made to do,
1245.311	"he goes, ""That's my boy! That's my girl!"
1249.382	You're using the talent
1249.382	"and ability that I gave you."""
1253.513	So my advice to you is:
1255.417	look at what's in your hand --
1257.171	your identity, your influence,
1257.171	your income --
1261.861	"and say, ""It's not about me."
1264.388	It's about making the world
1264.388	"a better place."""
1268.434	Thank you.
