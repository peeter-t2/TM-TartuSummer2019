12.16	Natalie MacMaster: I'm going to just
14.16	quickly start out with
16.16	a little bit of music here. (Applause)
18.16	(Music)
202.16	(Applause)
209.16	Thank you! (Applause)
215.16	I took my shoes off to dance,
217.16	but maybe I'll get at that later.
220.16	Anyways, I... where to start?
224.16	Well, I'm really excited
227.16	to talk a bit about
230.16	my own upbringing in music
233.16	and family and all of that,
236.16	but I'm even more excited for you people
238.16	to hear about Donnell's amazing family
241.16	and maybe even a little bit about
243.16	how we met,
245.16	and all that sort of thing,
248.16	but for those of you that may not
250.16	be familiar with my upbringing,
254.16	I'm from Cape Breton Island,
257.16	Nova Scotia, eastern Canada,
260.16	which is a very, very musical island,
263.16	and its origins come from Scotland
266.16	with the music and all the traditions,
269.16	the dancing, the language,
272.16	which unfortunately is dying out
275.16	in Cape Breton.
277.16	The traditional language is Gaelic,
279.16	but a lot of the music came
281.16	from the Gaelic language,
283.16	and the dancing and the singing
285.16	and everything, and my bloodline
288.16	is Scottish through and through,
291.16	but my mother and father
294.16	are two very, very musical people.
297.16	My mom taught me to dance
300.16	when I was five, and my dad
303.16	taught me to play fiddle when I was nine.
306.16	My uncle is a very well-known
308.16	Cape Breton fiddler.
310.16	His name's Buddy MacMaster,
312.16	and just a wonderful guy,
315.16	and we have a great tradition at home
317.16	called square dancing,
319.16	and we had parties, great parties
322.16	at our house and the neighbors' houses,
325.16	and you talk about kitchen cèilidhs.
327.16	Well, cèilidh first of all is Gaelic for party,
331.16	but kitchen party
333.16	in Cape Breton is very common,
336.16	and basically somebody drops into the house,
339.16	and no matter what house you go to
341.16	in Cape Breton, there's a fiddle there,
343.16	guaranteed, and I'd say,
345.16	well there's first of all more fiddlers
347.16	per capita in Cape Breton than anywhere
349.16	in the world, so ten chances to one,
351.16	the fellow who walked in the door
353.16	could play it, so you'd have someone come
355.16	into the house, you'd invite them to play
357.16	a tune, and lo and behold
359.16	a little party would start up and somebody would dance,
361.16	and somebody would sing, and all that sort of thing,
363.16	so it was a wonderful, wonderful way
365.16	to grow up, and that is where
367.16	my beginnings in music come from:
369.16	my surroundings, my family,
371.16	just my bloodline in itself, and, oh,
374.16	I've done lots of things with my music.
377.16	I've recorded lots of CDs.
379.16	I was nominated for a Grammy and
381.16	I've won some awards and stuff like that,
383.16	so that's awesome,
385.16	but the best part was meeting my husband,
388.16	and I've actually known Donnell
391.16	for probably 12 years now, and
394.16	I'm going to get into a little bit of, I guess,
397.16	how music brought us together,
400.16	but I'm going to introduce you
403.16	right now to my new husband
406.16	as of October 5,
409.16	Donnell Leahy. (Applause)
412.16	(Applause)
421.16	Donnell Leahy: Thank you. I'm kind of new to the TED
423.16	experience and I'm glad to be here,
425.16	but I'm just trying to put it all together,
427.16	trying to figure all you people out, and I've
429.16	been here for a short while, and I'm starting
431.16	to understand a little bit better.
433.16	So I asked Natalie, what do I do?
435.16	And she said, just talk about yourself.
437.16	It's kind of boring, but I'll just tell you a little
439.16	bit about my family. I'm one of 11 brothers
441.16	and sisters from Lakefield, Ontario,
444.16	an hour and a half northeast of Toronto,
447.16	and we grew up on a farm.
449.16	Mom and Dad raised beef cattle,
452.16	and I'm the oldest boy.
456.16	There are four girls a little bit older than me.
458.16	We grew up without a television.
460.16	People find that strange,
462.16	but I think it was a great blessing for us.
465.16	We had a television for a few years,
468.16	but of course we wasted so much time
470.16	and the work wasn't getting done,
472.16	so out went the television.
475.16	We grew up playing—
478.16	Mom's from Cape Breton, coincidentally.
480.16	Mom and Natalie's mother
482.16	knew each other. We grew up playing,
484.16	and used to dance together, right, yeah.
486.16	(Laughter) We grew up playing a bunch of,
488.16	we played by ear and I think
491.16	that's important for us because
493.16	we were not really exposed to a lot of
495.16	different styles of music.
497.16	We learned to play the instruments,
499.16	but we kind of had to come from within
501.16	or go from within, because we didn't
503.16	watch television, we didn't listen to a lot of
505.16	radio. We went to church
507.16	and to school sometimes,
509.16	and farmed and played music,
511.16	so we were able, I think,
513.16	at a very critical age to develop
515.16	our own style, our own self,
518.16	and my mother plays, my father plays,
521.16	and the style that came
524.16	from the Ottawa Valley in Ontario,
526.16	we call it French-Canadian style
529.16	but it originated in logging camps.
531.16	Years ago, hundreds of men would go
534.16	up for the winter to the camps
536.16	in Northern Ontario and in Quebec,
539.16	and they were all different cultures,
542.16	and the Irish, the French, Scottish,
544.16	German, they'd all meet, and of course
546.16	at night, they'd play cards
549.16	and step dance and play fiddles,
551.16	and over the course of many years,
554.16	the Ottawa Valley fiddling kind of evolved
556.16	and the Ottawa Valley step dancing
558.16	evolved, so that's, I kind of started out
560.16	with that style and I quickly
563.16	started doing my own thing,
566.16	and then I met Natalie, and I was
569.16	exposed to the great Cape Breton fiddling.
572.16	That's how we met. (Laughter)
575.16	You tell them. (Laughter)
578.16	NM: You want to or no? (Laughter)
581.16	Well I guess I have to now.
584.16	Well, it's just so interesting that
587.16	Donnell's upbringing was very similar
590.16	to mine, and I actually saw Donnell play
593.16	when I was about 12 years old,
596.16	and he and his family came to
599.16	Inverness, which is about 45 minutes
602.16	from where I lived, and I was just
605.16	blown away, like, it was just amazing,
608.16	and you'll find out why pretty soon here,
611.16	but I couldn't believe the fiddling
613.16	and Mom was there with me,
615.16	and she was saying —
617.16	Donnell's mother came up on stage
619.16	and danced with her children, and Mom
621.16	"was saying, ""That's Julie MacDonnell,"
623.16	I used to dance with her when we
625.16	were kids. Little did I think our children
628.16	would be playing instruments, you know,
630.16	"playing music, yeah."""
632.16	Twelve years, er, 20 years later little did she think
635.16	her kids would be getting married,
637.16	but anyway, so, then I got
640.16	a phone call about, I dunno,
643.16	seven years later. I was 19,
645.16	first or second year of college,
647.16	and it was Donnell, and
650.16	"he said ""Hi, you probably don't know me"
653.16	"but my name is Donnell Leahy."""
655.16	"And I said, ""I know you."
657.16	"I have a tape of yours at home."""
659.16	"And he said, ""Well, I'm in Truro,"""
661.16	which is where I was,
664.16	and he asked me out for supper.
667.16	That's it. (Laughter)
669.16	(Applause)
672.16	Then — Will I keep going? (Laughs)
675.16	(Laughter)
677.16	Then we dated for two years,
679.16	broke up for 10, got back together
682.16	and got married. (Laughter) (Applause)
685.16	DL: So anyway, we're running out of time,
688.16	so I'll just get to it.
691.16	I'm going to play a piece of music for you.
694.16	It's actually a Scottish piece I've chosen.
697.16	I starts out with a slow air.
699.16	Airs were played in Europe
702.16	at burials, as a body was carried out
704.16	from the wake site to the burial site,
706.16	the procession was led by a piper
708.16	or a fiddle player.
710.16	I'll quickly play a short part of the air,
713.16	and then I'm going to get into
715.16	kind of a crazy tune that is very difficult
717.16	to play when you're not warmed up,
719.16	so, if I mess it up, pretend you like it
721.16	anyway. It's called The Banks.
727.16	(Tuning)
743.16	(Laughter)
745.16	(Music)
991.16	(Applause)
1016.16	NM: Well, we're gonna play one
1018.16	together now. (Applause)
1020.16	We're laughing, like, because
1023.16	our styles are totally different,
1025.16	as you can hear.
1028.16	And so, you know, Donnell and I
1031.16	are actually in the process of
1033.16	writing new pieces of music together
1035.16	that we can play,
1037.16	but we don't have any of those ready.
1039.16	We just started yesterday. (Laughter)
1042.16	So we're gonna play something together anyway.
1044.16	DL: With one minute.
1046.16	NM: With one minute.
1048.16	(Audience reaction)
1050.16	DL: You start. NM: No, you have to start,
1052.16	because you've got to do your thing.
1054.16	(Music)
1060.16	NM: I'm not tuned. Hold on.
1068.16	(Tuning)
1076.16	NM: I feel like I'm in the duck or
1078.16	the bird pose right now. (Laughter)
1089.16	(Music)
1120.16	(Audience claps along)
1182.16	(Applause)
1190.16	Announcer: Great news,
1193.16	they're running late downstairs.
1195.16	We've got another 10 minutes.
1197.16	(Applause)
1204.16	NM: Okay. Sure.
1211.16	All right, okay.
1213.16	Let's get her going. (Applause)
1216.16	(Tuning)
1223.16	DL: What do you want to play?
1226.16	NM: Well, um...
1228.16	(Music) (Laughter)
1239.16	NM: Uh, sure.
1241.16	DL: How fast?
1244.16	NM: Not too fast.
1246.16	(Music)
1258.16	(Audience claps along)
1264.16	(Cheering)
1266.16	(Audience claps along)
1274.16	(Music)
1298.16	(Applause)
1309.16	DL: We're going to play a tune
1311.16	and Natalie's going to accompany me on the piano.
1313.16	The Cape Breton piano playing
1315.16	is just awesome. It's very rhythmic
1318.16	and, you'll see it.
1320.16	My mom plays piano, and she learned
1323.16	to play before they had a piano at home
1325.16	in Cape Breton. Before Mom's family had
1327.16	a piano in Cape Breton, she learned to play
1329.16	the rhythms on a piece of board,
1332.16	and the fiddlers would all congregate
1334.16	to play on the cold winter's evenings
1336.16	and Mom would be banging on this board,
1339.16	so when they bought a piano,
1341.16	they bought it in Toronto and had it taken
1343.16	by train and brought in on a horse,
1346.16	a horse and sleigh to the house.
1349.16	It became the only piano in the region,
1351.16	and Mom said she could basically play
1353.16	as soon as the piano arrived,
1356.16	she could play it because she had learned
1358.16	all these rhythms. Anyway, we found
1360.16	the piano last year and were able to
1362.16	bring it back home. We purchased it.
1364.16	It had gone through, like,
1366.16	five or six families,
1368.16	and it was just a big thing for us,
1370.16	and we found actually an old picture
1373.16	of somebody and their family years ago.
1376.16	Anyway, I'm blabbering on here.
1378.16	NM: No, I want you to tell them about Leahy.
1380.16	DL: What about Leahy? (Laughter)
1383.16	NM: Just tell them what—
1386.16	DL: She wants me to talk about—
1388.16	We have a band named Leahy.
1390.16	There's 11 siblings. We, um—
1392.16	What will I tell them? (Laughter)
1394.16	We opened—
1397.16	NM: No surgeries.
1399.16	DL: No surgeries, oh yeah.
1401.16	We had a great opportunity.
1403.16	We opened for Shania Twain for two years on her international tour.
1405.16	It was a big thing for us, and now
1407.16	all my sisters are off having babies
1409.16	and the boys are all getting married, so we're
1411.16	staying close to home for, I guess,
1413.16	another couple of weeks.
1415.16	What can I say? I don't know what to say,
1417.16	Natalie. We, uh... (Laughter)
1424.16	(Laughter)
1428.16	NM: Is this what marriage is about?
1430.16	(Applause)
1433.16	I like it. (Applause)
1439.16	(Laughter)
1441.16	DL: Oh yeah, okay,
1443.16	in my family we had seven girls, four boys,
1446.16	we had two fiddles and one piano,
1448.16	and of course we were all fighting to play
1450.16	on the instruments, so dad and mom
1453.16	set a rule that you couldn't kick anyone
1455.16	off the instrument. You had to wait
1457.16	until they were finished, so of course,
1459.16	what we would do is we'd get on the piano
1461.16	and you wouldn't even get off to eat,
1463.16	because you wouldn't want to give it up
1465.16	to your brother or sister, and they'd wait
1467.16	and wait and wait, and it'd be midnight
1469.16	and you'd be still sitting there on the piano,
1471.16	but it was their way to get us to practice.
1474.16	Will we play a tune?
1476.16	NM: It worked. DL: It worked.
1479.16	Sorry, I hate to carry on...
1481.16	So this is our last number, and we'll feature Nat on piano.
1483.16	Okay, play in, how about A?
1493.16	(Music)
1622.16	(Applause)
