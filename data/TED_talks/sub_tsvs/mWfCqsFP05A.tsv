13.115	So a chip, a poet and a boy.
18.52	It's just about 20 years ago,
20.485	June 1994, when Intel announced
23.989	that there was a flaw
26.002	at the core of their Pentium chip.
28.819	Deep in the code of the SRT algorithm
31.2	to calculate intermediate quotients necessary
33.451	for iterative floating points of divisions --
35.285	I don't know what that means, but 
35.285	it's what it says on Wikipedia —
38.384	there was a flaw and an error
41.263	that meant that there was a certain probability
43.479	that the result of the calculation would be an error,
46.487	and the probability was one out of every
52.617	So Intel said your average spreadsheet
54.611	would be flawed once every 27,000 years.
59.117	They didn't think it was significant,
60.411	but there was an outrage in the community.
63.637	The community, the techies, said, this flaw
65.987	has to be addressed.
67.068	They were not going to stand by quietly
69.069	as Intel gave them these chips.
71.017	So there was a revolution across the world.
73.063	People marched to demand --
76.093	okay, not really exactly like that —
78.202	but they rose up and they demanded
80.943	that Intel fix the flaw.
83.935	And Intel set aside 475 million dollars
89.787	to fund the replacement of millions of chips
92.029	to fix the flaw.
93.12	So billions of dollars in our society
95.332	was spent to address a problem
97.516	which would come once out of every 360 billion
101.607	calculations.
103.694	Number two, a poet.
106.297	This is Martin Niemöller.
108.577	You're familiar with his poetry.
110.11	Around the height of the Nazi period,
111.886	he started repeating the verse,
114.158	"""First they came for the communists,"
115.893	and I did nothing,
117.424	did not speak out because I was not a communist.
119.674	Then they came for the socialists.
120.728	Then they came for the trade unions.
122.69	Then they came for the Jews.
123.936	And then they came for me.
126.838	"But there was no one left to speak for me."""
131.509	Now, Niemöller is offering a certain kind of insight.
134.638	This is an insight at the core of intelligence.
137.97	We could call it cluefulness.
140.684	It's a certain kind of test:
143.245	Can you recognize
145.037	an underlying threat and respond?
147.541	Can you save yourself or save your kind?
151.031	Turns out ants are pretty good at this.
152.77	Cows, not so much.
154.853	So can you see the pattern?
157.283	Can you see a pattern and then recognize
159.63	and do something about it? Number two.
163.682	Number three, a boy.
165.609	This is my friend Aaron Swartz.
167.91	He's Tim's friend.
169.341	He's friends of many of you in this audience,
171.373	and seven years ago,
172.798	Aaron came to me with a question.
175.784	It was just before I was going
175.784	to give my first TED Talk.
178.367	I was so proud. I was telling him about my talk,
180.79	"""Laws that choke creativity."""
183.297	And Aaron looked at me
184.906	and was a little impatient, and he said,
186.857	"""So how are you ever"
190.95	going to solve the problems you're talking about?
192.99	Copyright policy, Internet policy,
194.792	how are you ever going to address those problems
197.982	so long as there's this fundamental corruption
201.215	"in the way our government works?"""
204.06	So I was a little put off by this.
206.665	He wasn't sharing in my celebration.
208.65	"And I said to him, ""You know, Aaron,"
209.817	"it's not my field, not my field."""
212.911	"He said, ""You mean as an"
212.911	"academic, it's not your field?"""
215.467	"I said, ""Yeah, as an academic, it's not my field."""
218.061	"He said, ""What about as a citizen?"
221.392	"As a citizen."""
224.819	Now, this is the way Aaron was.
226.415	He didn't tell. He asked questions.
231.476	But his questions spoke as clearly
233.226	as my four-year-old's hug.
235.914	He was saying to me,
237.33	"""You've got to get a clue."
239.262	You have got to get a clue, because there is
240.938	a flaw at the core of the operating system
244	of this democracy,
245.507	and it's not a flaw every one out of 360 billion times
249.805	our democracy tries to make a decision.
251.597	It is every time,
253.418	every single important issue.
255.814	We've got to end the bovinity of this political society.
260.347	We've got to adopt, it turns out,
261.99	the word is fourmi-formatic attitude --
264.762	that's what the Internet tells me the word is --
266.532	the ant's appreciative attitude
268.604	that gets us to recognize this flaw,
271.242	save our kind and save our demos.
277.055	Now if you know Aaron Swartz,
278.533	you know that we lost him
282.171	just over a year ago.
284.503	It was about six weeks
286.039	before I gave my TED Talk,
287.919	and I was so grateful to Chris
289.814	that he asked me to give this TED Talk,
291.245	not because I had the chance to talk to you,
293.445	although that was great,
295.729	but because it pulled me out
295.729	of an extraordinary depression.
299.162	I couldn't begin to describe the sadness.
303.671	Because I had to focus.
304.951	I had to focus on, what was I going to say to you?
309.266	It saved me.
311.468	But after the buzz, the excitement,
313.417	the power that comes from this community,
317.892	I began to yearn for a less sterile,
320.443	less academic way to address these issues,
322.96	the issues that I was talking about.
326.749	We'd begun to focus on New Hampshire
328.605	as a target for this political movement,
331.273	because the primary in New Hampshire
333.81	is so incredibly important.
335.6	It was a group called the New Hampshire Rebellion
338.201	that was beginning to talk about, how would we make
340.519	this issue of this corruption central in 2016?
343.769	But it was another soul that caught my imagination,
347.21	a woman named Doris Haddock, aka Granny D.
352.547	On January 1, 1999, 15 years ago,
355.909	at the age of 88, Granny D started a walk.
360.738	She started in Los Angeles
364.008	and began to walk to Washington, D.C.
366.97	with a single sign on her chest that said,
369.698	"""campaign finance reform."""
372.282	Eighteen months later,
375.01	at the age of 90,
376.82	she arrived in Washington
376.82	with hundreds following her,
379.346	including many congressmen
379.346	who had gotten in a car
381.664	and driven out about a mile outside of the city
384.572	to walk in with her.
386.46	(Laughter)
388.602	Now, I don't have 13 months
391.892	to walk across the country.
393.534	I've got three kids who hate to walk,
396.176	and a wife who, it turns out,
397.578	still hates when I'm not there
399.476	for mysterious reasons,
400.645	so this was not an option,
401.95	but the question I asked,
403.11	could we remix Granny D a bit?
405.658	What about a walk not of 3,200 miles
407.79	but of 185 miles across New Hampshire
411.71	in January?
415.314	So on January 11,
417.54	the anniversary of Aaron's death,
420.426	we began a walk that ended on January 24th,
424.169	the day that Granny D was born.
428.515	A total of 200 people joined us across this walk,
433.095	as we went from the very top to the
433.095	very bottom of New Hampshire
436.869	talking about this issue.
439.265	And what was astonishing to me,
440.865	something I completely did not expect to find,
443.426	was the passion and anger
446.021	that there was among everyone
446.021	that we talked to about this issue.
451.496	We had found in a poll that 96 percent of Americans
456.602	believe it important to reduce the influence
458.441	of money in politics.
460.687	Now politicians and pundits tell you,
462.703	there's nothing we can do about this issue,
464.523	Americans don't care about it,
465.859	but the reason for that is
468.155	that 91 percent of Americans
470.009	think there's nothing that can
470.009	be done about this issue.
474.531	And it's this gap between 96 and 91
477.353	that explains our politics of resignation.
479.83	I mean, after all, at least 96 percent of us
481.913	wish we could fly like Superman,
483.775	but because at least 91 percent
483.775	of us believe we can't,
486.939	we don't leap off of tall buildings every time
489.605	we have that urge.
490.915	That's because we accept our limits,
492.921	and so too with this reform.
495.68	But when you give people the sense of hope,
499.973	you begin to thaw that
499.973	absolute sense of impossibility.
506.69	As Harvey Milk said, if you give 'em hope,
510.305	you give 'em a chance, a way to think
513.02	about how this change is possible.
515.109	Hope.
517.96	And hope is the one thing that we, Aaron's friends,
521.53	failed him with, because we let him
524.527	lose that sense of hope.
530.127	I loved that boy like I love my son.
538.233	But we failed him.
542.202	And I love my country,
545.79	and I'm not going to fail that.
548.144	I'm not going to fail that.
549.316	That sense of hope, we're going to hold,
553.009	and we're going to fight for,
554.475	however impossible this battle looks.
559.175	What's next?
560.469	Well, we started with this march with 200 people,
563.63	and next year, there will be 1,000
567.032	on different routes
568.671	that march in the month of January
571.181	and meet in Concord to celebrate this cause,
575.009	and then in 2016, before the primary,
577.569	there will be 10,000 who march across that state,
580.53	meeting in Concord to celebrate this cause.
583.594	And as we have marched, people around the country
586.365	"have begun to say, ""Can we do the same thing"
588.223	"in our state?"""
589.34	So we've started a platform called G.D. Walkers,
591.719	that is, Granny D walkers,
593.71	and Granny D walkers across the country
595.837	will be marching for this reform. Number one.
598.939	Number two, on this march,
601.219	one of the founders of Thunderclap, David Cascino,
604.011	was with us,
605.63	"and he said, ""Well what can we do?"""
607.488	And so they developed a platform,
609.817	which we are announcing today,
611.739	that allows us to pull together voters
614.205	who are committed to this idea of reform.
616.883	Regardless of where you are,
618.029	in New Hampshire or outside of New Hampshire,
620.681	you can sign up and directly be informed
622.591	where the candidates are on this issue
625.579	so you can decide who to vote for
627.219	as a function of which is going
630.137	to make this possibility real.
634.605	And then finally number three, the hardest.
638.677	We're in the age of the Super PAC.
640.5	Indeed yesterday, Merriam announced
642.609	that Merriam-Webster will have Super PAC as a word.
646.859	It is now an official word in the dictionary.
650.499	So on May 1, aka May Day,
655.894	we're going to try an experiment.
658.681	We're going to try a launching
660.498	of what we can think of as a Super PAC
662.796	to end all Super PACs.
666.06	And the basic way this works is this.
667.86	For the last year, we have been working
669.632	with analysts and political experts
673.352	to calculate, how much would it cost
676.684	to win enough votes in the United States Congress
679.106	to make fundamental reform possible?
680.926	What is that number? Half a billion? A billion?
683.728	What is that number?
685.568	And then whatever that number is,
688.333	we are going to kickstart, sort of,
690.438	because you can't use KickStarter for political work,
692.369	but anyway, kickstart, sort of,
695.14	first a bottom-up campaign
697.496	where people will make small dollar commitments
700.476	contingent on reaching very ambitious goals,
703.438	and when those goals have been reached,
705.438	we will turn to the large dollar contributors,
709.577	to get them to contribute to make it possible
712.959	for us to run the kind of Super PAC necessary
716.482	to win this issue,
717.824	to change the way money influences politics,
720.718	so that on November 8,
724.489	which I discovered yesterday is the day
726.817	that Aaron would have been 30 years old,
730.508	on November 8,
733.2	we will celebrate 218 representatives
736.739	in the House and 60 Senators
738.826	in the United States Senate
740.847	who have committed to this idea
743.14	of fundamental reform.
745.006	So last night, we heard about wishes.
748.768	Here's my wish.
750.856	May one.
754.1	May the ideals of one boy
757.483	unite one nation behind one critical idea
761.964	that we are one people,
764.425	we are the people who were promised a government,
767.902	a government that was promised to be
770.031	dependent upon the people alone, the people,
774.752	who, as Madison told us,
777.601	meant not the rich more than the poor.
781.178	May one.
783.324	And then may you, may you join this movement,
787.503	not because you're a politician,
789.511	not because you're an expert,
791.127	not because this is your field,
794.419	but because if you are,
796.099	you are a citizen.
799.77	Aaron asked me that.
802.807	Now I've asked you.
805.662	Thank you very much.
807.34	(Applause)
