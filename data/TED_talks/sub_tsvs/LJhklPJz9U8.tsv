12.448	I'm going to go off script
13.715	and make Chris quite nervous here
15.766	by making this audience participation.
18.114	All right. Are you with me? Yeah. Yeah. All right.
21.297	So what I'd like to do is have you raise your hand
23.741	if you've ever heard a
23.741	heterosexual couple having sex.
27.797	Could be the neighbors, hotel room,
30.348	your parents. Sorry.
32.355	Okay. Pretty much everybody.
34.107	Now raise your hand if the man was making
35.934	more noise than the woman.
39.363	I see one guy there.
41.676	It doesn't count if it was you, sir.
43.923	(Laughter)
44.938	So his hand's down. And one woman. Okay.
48.448	Sitting next to a loud guy.
50.524	Now what does this tell us?
52.148	It tells us that human beings
53.994	make noise when they have sex,
55.362	and it's generally the woman who makes more noise.
57.488	This is known as female copulatory vocalization
60.542	to the clipboard crowd.
61.965	I wasn't even going to mention this,
63.596	but somebody told me that Meg Ryan might be here,
66.537	and she is the world's most famous
69.141	female copulatory vocalizer.
71.09	So I thought, got to talk about that.
73.49	We'll get back to that a little bit later.
76.203	Let me start by saying human beings
78.168	are not descended from apes,
80.269	despite what you may have heard. We are apes.
82.501	We are more closely related
82.501	to the chimp and the bonobo
85.337	than the African elephant is to the Indian elephant,
88.717	as Jared Diamond pointed
88.717	out in one of his early books.
91.915	We're more closely related to chimps and bonobos
96.11	than chimps and bonobos are related
97.611	to any other primate --
99.273	gorillas, orangutans, what have you.
101.549	So we're extremely closely related to them,
104.796	and as you'll see in terms of our behavior,
107.222	we've got some relationship as well.
109.589	So what I'm asking today, the question
111.508	I want to explore with you today is,
114.57	what kind of ape are we in terms of our sexuality?
118.738	Now, since Darwin's day there's been
120.956	what Cacilda and I have called
122.458	the standard narrative of human sexual evolution,
125.144	and you're all familiar with it,
126.698	even if you haven't read this stuff.
129.261	The idea is that, as part of human nature,
132.329	from the beginning of our species' time,
134.318	men have sort of leased
134.318	women's reproductive potential
138.812	by providing them with certain goods and services.
142.207	Generally we're talking about meat, shelter, status,
145.877	protection, things like that.
148.508	And in exchange, women have offered fidelity,
150.843	or at least a promise of fidelity.
153.221	Now this sets men and women up
153.221	in an oppositional relationship.
157.491	The war between the sexes is built right into
157.491	our DNA, according to this vision. Right?
163.434	What Cacilda and I have argued is that no,
167.371	this economic relationship,
169.812	this oppositional relationship,
171.637	is actually an artifact of agriculture,
174.262	which only arose about 10,000
174.262	years ago at the earliest.
177.938	Anatomically modern human beings
180.105	have been around for about 200,000 years,
183.104	so we're talking about five percent, at most,
186.726	of our time as a modern, distinct species.
190.414	So before agriculture,
193.948	before the agricultural revolution,
195.953	it's important to understand that human beings
198.064	lived in hunter-gatherer groups that are
201.398	characterized wherever they're found in the world
204.414	by what anthropologists called fierce egalitarianism.
209.005	They not only share things,
210.873	they demand that things be shared:
213.382	meat, shelter, protection, all these things
215.641	that were supposedly being traded to women
218.65	for their sexual fidelity, it turns out,
221.48	are shared widely among these societies.
224.21	Now I'm not saying that our ancestors
226.398	were noble savages, and I'm not saying
228.359	modern day hunter-gatherers
228.359	are noble savages either.
231.155	What I'm saying is that this is simply
233.166	the best way to mitigate risk
235.606	in a foraging context.
237.536	And there's really no argument
237.536	about this among anthropologists.
240.652	All Cacilda and I have done is extend
240.652	this sharing behavior to sexuality.
245.216	So we've argued that human sexuality
247.651	has essentially evolved, until agriculture,
252.135	as a way of establishing and maintaining
255.281	the complex, flexible social systems, networks,
259.007	that our ancestors were very good at,
261.918	and that's why our species has survived so well.
266.534	Now, this makes some people uncomfortable,
268.751	and so I always need to take 
268.751	a moment in these talks
271.136	to say, listen,
272.98	I'm saying our ancestors were promiscuous,
275.623	but I'm not saying they were
275.623	having sex with strangers.
277.958	There were no strangers. Right?
279.984	In a hunter-gatherer band, there are no strangers.
281.828	You've known these people your entire life.
283.817	So I'm saying, yes, there were
283.817	overlapping sexual relationships,
287.276	that our ancestors probably had
287.276	several different sexual relationships
291.583	going on at any given moment in their adult lives.
294.97	But I'm not saying they were
294.97	having sex with strangers.
297.373	I'm not saying that they didn't love the
297.373	people they were having sex with.
300.484	And I'm not saying there was
300.484	no pair-bonding going on.
303.389	I'm just saying it wasn't sexually exclusive.
306.475	And those of us who have
306.475	chosen to be monogamous --
310.159	my parents, for example, have been married
312.497	for 52 years monogamously,
315.005	and if it wasn't monogamously, Mom and Dad,
317.367	I don't want to hear about itâ€”
319.714	I'm not criticizing this and I'm not saying
322.106	there's anything wrong with this.
323.662	What I'm saying is that to argue
325.821	that our ancestors were sexual omnivores
330.495	is no more a criticism of monogamy
332.782	than to argue that our ancestors
332.782	were dietary omnivores
336.25	is a criticism of vegetarianism.
339.573	You can choose to be a vegetarian,
341.454	but don't think that just because
341.454	you've made that decision,
344.198	bacon suddenly stops smelling good.
346.99	Okay? So this is my point.
349.677	(Laughter)
352.028	That one took a minute to sink in, huh?
355.649	Now, in addition to being a great genius,
357.979	a wonderful man, a wonderful husband,
360.044	a wonderful father, Charles Darwin
361.824	was also a world-class Victorian prude.
365.936	All right? He was perplexed
367.876	by the sexual swellings of certain primates,
370.486	including chimps and bonobos,
372.029	because these sexual swellings tend to provoke
374.567	many males to mate with the females.
377.159	So he couldn't understand why on Earth would
377.159	the female have developed this thing
380.33	if all they were supposed to be doing
380.33	is forming their pair bond, right?
384.259	Chimps and bonobos, Darwin didn't really know this,
386.698	but chimps and bonobos mate
388.646	one to four times per hour
390.3	with up to a dozen males per day
393.716	when they have their sexual swellings.
396.332	Interestingly, chimps have sexual swellings
398.987	through 40 percent, roughly,
400.789	of their menstrual cycle,
402.674	bonobos 90 percent,
405.374	and humans are among the
405.374	only species on the planet
408.796	where the female is available for sex
410.898	throughout the menstrual cycle,
412.886	whether she's menstruating,
412.886	whether she's post-menopausal,
415.63	whether she's already pregnant.
416.941	This is vanishingly rare among mammals.
420.785	So it's a very interesting aspect of human sexuality.
424.578	Now, Darwin ignored the reflections
427.253	of the sexual swelling in his own day,
430.821	as scientists tend to do sometimes.
434.452	So what we're talking about is sperm competition.
436.957	Now the average human ejaculate
436.957	has about 300 million sperm cells,
440.367	so it's already a competitive environment.
442.797	The question is whether these sperm are 
442.797	competing against other men's sperm
446.03	or just their own.
447.815	There's a lot to talk about in this chart.
449.921	The one thing I'll call your attention to right away
452.096	is the little musical note above the
452.096	female chimp and bonobo and human.
456.138	That indicates female copulatory vocalization.
459.439	Just look at the numbers.
461.041	The average human has sex
463.237	about 1,000 times per birth.
466.879	If that number seems high for some of you,
469.052	I assure you it seems low for others in the room.
472.265	We share that ratio with chimps and bonobos.
475.215	We don't share it with the other three apes,
477.517	the gorilla, the orangutan and the gibbon,
479.773	who are more typical of mammals,
481.434	having sex only about a dozen times per birth.
484.626	Humans and bonobos are the only 
484.626	animals that have sex face-to-face
488.847	when both of them are alive.
491.253	(Laughter)
495.895	And you'll see that the human, chimp and bonobo
499.066	all have external testicles, which in our book
501.462	we equate to a special fridge you have in the garage
505.45	just for beer.
507.71	If you're the kind of guy who has a beer fridge
510.436	in the garage, you expect a party to happen
512.778	at any moment, and you need to be ready.
514.567	That's what the external testicles are.
516.722	They keep the sperm cells cool
519.132	so you can have frequent ejaculations.
521.35	I'm sorry. It's true.
525.089	The human, some of you will be happy to hear,
528.178	has the largest, thickest penis of any primate.
530.989	Now, this evidence goes way beyond anatomy.
533.499	It goes into anthropology as well.
536.06	Historical records are full of accounts of people
538.677	around the world who have sexual practices
540.486	that should be impossible
542.116	given what we have assumed
542.116	about human sexual evolution.
546.042	These women are the Mosuo
546.042	from southwestern China.
548.742	In their society, everyone, men and women,
551.309	are completely sexually autonomous.
553.05	There's no shame associated with sexual behavior.
556.009	Women have hundreds of partners.
558.255	It doesn't matter. Nobody cares.
558.255	Nobody gossips. It's not an issue.
561.437	When the woman becomes pregnant,
563.233	the child is cared for by her, 
563.233	her sisters, and her brothers.
566.091	The biological father is a nonissue.
568.93	On the other side of the planet, in the Amazon,
571.336	we've got many tribes which practice
574.205	what anthropologists call partible paternity.
576.937	These people actually believe --
579.534	and they have no contact among them,
581.249	no common language or anything,
582.905	so it's not an idea that spread,
584.642	it's an idea that's arisen around the world --
586.779	they believe that a fetus is literally made
588.936	of accumulated semen.
591.212	So a woman who wants to have a child
593.2	who's smart and funny and strong
595.032	makes sure she has lots of sex with the smart guy,
597.163	the funny guy and the strong guy,
599.107	to get the essence of each of
599.107	these men into the baby,
601.331	and then when the child is born,
603.843	these different men will come forward
605.985	and acknowledge their paternity of the child.
608.855	So paternity is actually sort of a team endeavor
611.693	in this society.
613.309	So there are all sorts of examples like this
615.297	that we go through in the book.
617.747	Now, why does this matter?
621.207	Edward Wilson says we need to understand
623.767	that human sexuality is first a bonding device
626.813	and only secondarily procreation.
629.648	I think that's true. This matters because
631.832	our evolved sexuality is in direct conflict
634.87	with many aspects of the modern world.
637.457	The contradictions between what we're told
639.595	we should feel and what we actually do feel
643.022	generates a huge amount of unnecessary suffering.
648.159	My hope is that a more accurate,
650.575	updated understanding of human sexuality
652.95	will lead us to have greater tolerance for ourselves,
655.97	for each other,
657.567	greater respect for unconventional
657.567	relationship configurations
661.19	like same-sex marriage or polyamorous unions,
666.471	and that we'll finally put to rest the idea
669.819	that men have some innate, instinctive right
672.393	to monitor and control women's sexual behavior.
676.621	(Applause)
679.613	Thank you.
681.767	And we'll see that it's not only gay people
684.023	that have to come out of the closet.
685.692	We all have closets we have to come out of. Right?
689.221	And when we do come out of those closets,
690.982	we'll recognize that our fight is not with each other,
694.541	our fight is with an outdated, 
694.541	Victorian sense of human sexuality
699.045	that conflates desire with property rights,
702.6	generates shame and confusion
705.365	in place of understanding and empathy.
708.2	It's time we moved beyond Mars and Venus,
710.916	because the truth is
712.646	that men are from Africa
713.983	and women are from Africa.
715.979	Thank you.
717.924	(Applause)
726.53	Chris Anderson: Thank you.
726.53	Christopher Ryan: Thank you.
729.024	CA: So a question.
730.766	It's so perplexing, trying to use arguments
734.665	about evolutionary history
737.732	to turn that into what we ought to do today.
740.316	Someone could give a talk and say,
742.722	look at us, we've got these really sharp teeth
745.467	and muscles and a brain that's really good
747.194	at throwing weapons,
748.755	and if you look at lots of societies around the world,
751.819	you'll see very high rates of violence.
754.105	Nonviolence is a choice like vegetarianism,
757.274	but it's not who you are.
759.418	How is that different
761.468	from the talk you gave?
764.833	CR: Well first of all, the evidence
768.017	for high levels of violence in prehistory
770.792	is very debatable.
773.398	But that's just an example.
775.599	Certainly, you know, lots of people say to me,
779.203	just because we lived a certain way in the past
781.743	doesn't mean we should live that 
781.743	way now, and I agree with that.
784.942	Everyone has to respond to the modern world.
787.469	But the body does have its inherent
791.891	evolved trajectories.
794.748	And so you could live on
794.748	McDonald's and milkshakes,
798.228	but your body will rebel against 
798.228	that. We have appetites.
801.702	I think it was Schopenhauer who said,
803.39	a person can do what they want
806.254	but not want what they want.
808.311	And so what I'm arguing against
810.034	is the shame that's associated with desires.
812.498	It's the idea that if you love your husband or wife
815.857	but you still are attracted to other people,
818.067	there's something wrong with you,
819.566	there's something wrong with your marriage,
821.503	something wrong with your partner.
822.963	I think a lot of families are fractured
824.986	by unrealistic expectations
826.971	that are based upon this false
826.971	vision of human sexuality.
830.016	That's what I'm trying to get at.
831.48	CA: Thank you. Communicated
831.48	powerfully. Thanks a lot.
833.979	CR: Thank you, Chris.
833.979	(Applause)
