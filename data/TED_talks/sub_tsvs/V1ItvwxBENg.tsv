13.359	Our ability to create
13.359	and sustain economic growth
18.48	is the defining challenge of our time.
21.24	Of course there are other challenges --
23.8	health care, disease burdens
23.8	and pandemics,
26.96	environmental challenges
29.4	and, of course, radicalized terrorism.
32.8	However,
34.04	to the extent that we can actually
34.04	solve the economic growth challenge,
38.64	it will take us a long way
40	to solving the challenges
40	that I've just elucidated.
43.4	More importantly,
45.08	unless and until we solve economic growth
49.6	and create sustainable,
49.6	long-term economic growth,
53.64	we'll be unable to address
56.08	the seemingly intractable challenges
56.08	that continue to pervade the globe today,
61.44	whether it's health care,
61.44	education or economic development.
66.68	The fundamental question is this:
69.52	How are we going to create economic growth
72.16	in advanced and developed economies
72.16	like the United States and across Europe
76.76	at a time when they continue to struggle
78.84	to create economic growth
78.84	after the financial crisis?
82.48	They continue to underperform
85.28	and to see an erosion in the three
85.28	key drivers of economic growth:
90.04	capital, labor and productivity.
94.12	In particular,
95.6	these developed economies
95.6	continue to see debts and deficits,
100.56	the decline and erosion
100.56	of both the quality and quantity of labor
105.44	and they also see productivity stalling.
108.6	In a similar vein,
110.32	how are we going to create
110.32	economic growth in the emerging markets,
113.76	where 90 percent
113.76	of the world's population lives
117.04	and where, on average,
	is under the age of 25?
122.64	In these countries,
124.12	it is essential that they grow
124.12	at a minimum of seven percent a year
128.32	in order to put a dent in poverty
130.44	and to double per capita incomes
130.44	in one generation.
134.52	And yet today,
136.6	the largest emerging economies --
138.72	countries with at least
141.44	continue to struggle to reach
141.44	that seven percent magic mark.
145.76	Worse than that,
147	countries like India, Russia,
147	South Africa, Brazil and even China
151.64	are falling below
151.64	that seven percent number
154.16	and, in many cases, actually regressing.
157.8	Economic growth matters.
160.44	With economic growth,
161.92	countries and societies
161.92	enter into a virtuous cycle
166.12	of upward mobility, opportunity
166.12	and improved living standards.
171.24	Without growth,
171.24	countries contract and atrophy,
175.08	not just in the annals
175.08	of economic statistics
178.32	but also in the meaning of life
178.32	and how lives are lived.
182.6	Economic growth matters
182.6	powerfully for the individual.
187.12	If growth wanes,
188.76	the risk to human progress
190.8	and the risk of political
190.8	and social instability rises,
195.24	and societies become dimmer,
195.24	coarser and smaller.
200.6	The context matters.
202.32	And countries in emerging markets
203.96	do not need to grow at the same
203.96	rates as developed countries.
209.24	Now, I know some of you in this room
209.24	find this to be a risky proposition.
214.68	There are some people here
216.56	who will turn around
216.56	and be quite disillusioned
219.12	by what's happened around the world
220.92	and basically ascribe that
220.92	to economic growth.
224.24	You worry about the
224.24	overpopulation of the planet.
227.76	And looking at the UN's
227.76	recent statistics and projections
230.68	that the world will have
233.4	before it plateaus in 2100,
236	you're concerned about what that does
236	to natural resources --
239.84	arable land, potable water,
239.84	energy and minerals.
244.8	You are also concerned about
244.8	the degradation of the environment.
248.76	And you worry about how man,
251.92	embodied in the corporate globalist,
254.56	has become greedy and corrupt.
258.56	But I'm here to tell you today
258.56	that economic growth
261.96	has been the backbone
261.96	of changes in living standards
265.36	of millions of people around the world.
267.96	And more importantly,
269.8	it's not just economic growth
269.8	that has been driven by capitalism.
276.28	The definition of capitalism,
276.28	very simply put,
279.76	is that the factors of production,
281.84	such as trade and industry,
281.84	capital and labor,
285.24	are left in the hands
285.24	of the private sector and not the state.
289.68	It's really essential here
289.68	that we understand
292.44	that fundamentally the critique
292.44	is not for economic growth per se
297.48	but what has happened to capitalism.
299.56	And to the extent that we need to create
299.56	economic growth over the long term,
303.6	we're going to have to pursue it
303.6	with a better form of economic stance.
309.32	Economic growth needs capitalism,
312.24	but it needs it to work properly.
314.84	And as I mentioned a moment ago,
317.16	the core of the capitalist system
317.16	has been defined by private actors.
323.72	And even this, however,
323.72	is a very simplistic dichotomy.
327.8	Capitalism: good; non-capitalism: bad.
331.12	When in practical experience,
333.8	capitalism is much more of a spectrum.
336.28	And we have countries such as China,
338.56	which have practiced
338.56	more state capitalism,
341	and we have countries
341	like the Unites States
343.12	which are more market capitalist.
345.16	Our efforts to critique
345.16	the capitalist system, however,
348.32	have tended to focus
348.32	on countries like China
351.56	that are in fact
351.56	not blatantly market capitalism.
355.6	However, there is
355.6	a real reason and real concern
359.28	for us to now focus our attentions
359.28	on purer forms of capitalism,
363.96	particularly those embodied
363.96	by the United States.
367.28	This is really important
369.08	because this type of capitalism
371.56	has increasingly
371.56	been afforded the critique
374.84	that it is now fostering corruption
377.28	and, worse still,
378.68	it's increasing income inequality --
382.12	the idea that the few are benefiting
382.12	at the expense of the many.
388.76	The two really critical questions
388.76	that we need to address
392	is how can we fix capitalism
394.72	so that it can help create economic growth
397.52	but at the same time
397.52	can help to address social ills.
401.72	In order to think about that framing,
401.72	we have to ask ourselves,
405.12	how does capitalism work today?
407.76	Very simplistically,
409.96	capitalism is set on the basis
409.96	of an individual utility maximizer --
415.76	a selfish individual
415.76	who goes after what he or she wants.
420.08	And only after they've
420.08	maximized their utility
423.24	do they then decide it's important
425.76	to provide support
425.76	to other social contracts.
429.36	Of course, in this system
429.36	governments do tax,
432.8	and they use part of their revenues
432.8	to fund social programs,
436.56	recognizing that government's role
436.56	is not just regulation
439.44	but also to be arbiter of social goods.
443.32	But nevertheless,
444.64	this framework --
446	this two-stage framework --
448	is the basis from which we must now start
450	to think about how we can
450	improve the capitalist model.
453.52	I would argue that there are
453.52	two sides to this challenge.
457.52	First of all,
458.76	we can draw on the right-wing policies
461.72	to see what could be beneficial for us
463.6	to think about how
463.6	we can improve capitalism.
466.44	In particular,
467.72	right-leaning policies
469.48	have tended to focus on things
469.48	like conditional transfers,
472.96	where we pay and reward people
472.96	for doing the things
476	that we actually think
476	can help enhance economic growth.
479.48	For example,
480.72	sending children to school,
482.36	parents could earn money for that,
484.6	or getting their children
484.6	inoculated or immunized,
488	parents could get paid for doing that.
490.36	Now, quite apart from the debate
492.48	on whether or not
492.48	we should be paying people
494.8	to do what we think they should do anyway,
497.52	the fact of the matter
497.52	is that pay for performance
500.72	has actually yielded some positive results
503.16	in places like Mexico,
504.88	in Brazil
506.16	and also in pilot programs in New York.
509.52	But there are also benefits
511.04	and significant changes underway
511.04	on left-leaning policies.
515.88	Arguments that government should
515.88	expand its role and responsibility
520.16	so that it's not so narrowly defined
522.4	and that government should be
522.4	much more of an arbiter
524.919	of the factors of production
526.32	have become commonplace
526.32	with the success of China.
529.4	But also we've started to have debates
531.72	about how the role of the private sector
534	should move away
534	from just being a profit motive
536.6	and really be more engaged
536.6	in the delivery of social programs.
540.12	Things like the corporate
540.12	social responsibility programs,
543.36	albeit small in scale,
545.36	are moving in that right direction.
547.96	Of course, left-leaning policies
547.96	have also tended to blur the lines
553.2	between government,
553.2	NGOs and private sector.
556.8	Two very good examples of this
556.8	are the 19th-century United States,
560.8	when the infrastructure rollout
562.44	was really about
562.44	public-private partnerships.
565.56	More recently, of course,
567	the advent of the Internet
567	has also proven to the world
570.64	that public and private can work together
570.64	for the betterment of society.
576.24	My fundamental message to you is this:
579.32	We cannot continue to try and solve
579.32	the world economic growth challenges
584.76	by being dogmatic
584.76	and being unnecessarily ideological.
589.8	In order to create sustainable,
589.8	long-term economic growth
593.64	and solve the challenges and social ills
593.64	that continue to plague the world today,
597.96	we're going to have to be
597.96	more broad-minded
600.28	about what might work.
602.28	Ultimately,
603.88	we have to recognize
603.88	that ideology is the enemy of growth.
608.04	Thank you.
609.28	(Applause)
615.16	Bruno Giussani: I want to ask
615.16	a couple of questions, Dambisa,
618.08	because one could react
618.08	to your last sentence
620.24	by saying growth is also an ideology,
622.08	it's possibly the dominant
622.08	ideology of our times.
624.44	What do you say
624.44	to those who react that way?
626.56	DM: Well, I think that that's
626.56	completely legitimate,
629.04	and I think that we're already
629.04	having that discussion.
631.64	There's a lot of work
631.64	going on around happiness
633.88	and other metrics being used
633.88	for measuring people's success
637.4	and improvements in living standards.
639.24	And so I think that we should be open
641.32	to what could deliver improvements
641.32	in people's living standards
644.32	and continue to reduce
644.32	poverty around the world.
646.6	BG: So you're basically pleading
646.6	for rehabilitating growth,
649.44	but the only way for that happen
651.04	without compromising
651.04	the capacity of the earth,
653.4	to take us on a long journey,
654.96	is for economic growth
656.64	somehow to decouple
656.64	from the underlying use of resources.
659.36	Do you see that happening?
660.68	DM: Well, I think that I'm more optimistic
660.68	about human ability and ingenuity.
665.24	I think if we start to constrain ourselves
667.44	using the finite, scarce
667.44	and depleting resources
670.52	that we know today,
671.8	we could get quite negative
673.16	and quite concerned
673.16	about the way the world is.
675.4	However, we've seen the Club of Rome,
677.72	we've seen previous claims
680.16	that the world would be
680.16	running out of resources,
682.52	and it's not to argue
682.52	that those things are not valid.
685.12	But I think, with ingenuity
685.12	we could see desalination,
687.8	I think we could reinvest in energy,
689.76	so that we can actually
689.76	get better outcomes.
691.92	And so in that sense,
693.16	I'm much more optimistic
693.16	about what humans can do.
695.56	BG: The thing that strikes me
697	about your proposals
697	for rehabilitating growth
700.4	and taking a different direction
702.04	is that you're kind of suggesting
702.04	to fix capitalism with more capitalism --
707.12	with putting a price tag
707.12	on good behavior as incentive
710.76	or developing a bigger role
710.76	for business in social issues.
714.96	Is that what you're suggesting?
716.48	DM: I'm suggesting
716.48	we have to be open-minded.
718.64	I think it is absolutely the case
720.88	that traditional models of economic growth
723.36	are not working the way
723.36	we would like them to.
725.8	And I think it's no accident
727.72	that today the largest
727.72	economy in the world, the United States,
731.04	has democracy,
732.36	liberal democracy,
732.36	as it's core political stance
735.48	and it has free market capitalism --
737.68	to the extent that it is free --
739.28	free market capitalism
739.28	as its economic stance.
741.48	The second largest economy is China.
743.64	It has deprioritized democracy
745.8	and it has state capitalism,
745.8	which is a completely different model.
749	These two countries,
749	completely different political models
751.76	and completely different economic models,
753.76	and yet they have the same
753.76	income inequality number
756.2	measured as a Gini coefficient.
757.72	I think those are the debates
757.72	we should have,
759.88	because it's not clear at all
762.04	what model we should be adopting,
763.88	and I think there needs to be
763.88	much more discourse
766.24	and much more humility
766.24	about what we know and what we don't know.
769.68	BG: One last question.
769.68	The COP21 is going on in Paris.
773.08	If you could send a tweet
774.6	to all the heads of state
774.6	and heads of delegations there,
777.92	what would you say?
779.32	DM: Again, I would be very much
779.32	about being open-minded.
782	As you're aware,
783.24	the issues around
783.24	the environmental concerns
785.36	have been on the agenda many times now --
787.36	in Copenhagen,
787.36	'72 in Stockholm --
789.64	and we keep revisiting these issues
791.96	partly because there is not
791.96	a fundamental agreement,
795.56	in fact there's a schism
796.84	between what the developed
796.84	countries believe and want
799.6	and what emerging market countries want.
801.96	Emerging market countries need
801.96	to continue to create economic growth
805.2	so that we don't have political
805.2	uncertainty in the those countries.
808.64	Developed countries recognize
810.8	that they have a real,
810.8	important responsibility
813.08	not only just to manage
813.08	their CO2 emissions
815.92	and some of the degradation
815.92	that they're contributing to the world,
819.12	but also as trendsetters in R&amp;D.
820.92	And so they have to come
820.92	to the table as well.
823.2	But in essence, it cannot be a situation
825.68	where we start ascribing policies
825.68	to the emerging markets
829.84	without developed countries themselves
831.72	also taking quite a swipe
831.72	at what they're doing
834.12	both in demand and supply
834.12	in developed markets.
836.92	BG: Dambisa, thank you for coming to TED.
836.92	DM: Thank you very much.
840.04	(Applause)
