12.579	I would like to demonstrate
12.579	for the first time in public
16.048	that it is possible to transmit a video
20.143	from a standard off-the-shelf LED lamp
24.476	to a solar cell with a laptop
24.476	acting as a receiver.
30.478	There is no Wi-Fi involved,
30.478	it's just light.
33.093	And you may wonder, what's the point?
35.951	And the point is this:
38.399	There will be a massive
38.399	extension of the Internet
41.099	to close the digital divide,
43.933	and also to allow for what we call
43.933	"""The Internet of Things"" --"
48.138	tens of billions of devices
48.138	connected to the Internet.
51.328	In my view, such an extension
51.328	of the Internet can only work
55.383	if it's almost energy-neutral.
58.173	This means we need to use existing
58.173	infrastructure as much as possible.
63.497	And this is where the solar cell
63.497	and the LED come in.
68.959	I demonstrated for the first time,
71.301	at TED in 2011,
73.29	Li-Fi, or Light Fidelity.
75.781	Li-Fi uses off-the-shelf LEDs
75.781	to transmit data incredibly fast,
81.8	and also in a safe and secure manner.
85.402	Data is transported by the light,
88.307	encoded in subtle changes
88.307	of the brightness.
92.39	If we look around,
92.39	we have many LEDs around us,
95.978	so there's a rich infrastructure
95.978	of Li-Fi transmitters around us.
101.393	But so far, we have been using
101.393	special devices -- small photo detectors,
106.656	to receive the information
106.656	encoded in the data.
110.94	I wanted to find a way to also use
110.94	existing infrastructure
114.856	to receive data from our Li-Fi lights.
118.426	And this is why I have been looking into
118.426	solar cells and solar panels.
123.016	A solar cell absorbs light
123.016	and converts it into electrical energy.
128.549	This is why we can use a solar cell
128.549	to charge our mobile phone.
133.559	But now we need to remember
134.989	that the data is encoded in subtle changes
134.989	of the brightness of the LED,
141.244	so if the incoming light fluctuates,
144.617	so does the energy harvested
144.617	from the solar cell.
148.579	This means we have
148.579	a principal mechanism in place
152.112	to receive information from the light
152.112	and by the solar cell,
158.246	because the fluctuations
158.246	of the energy harvested
161.045	correspond to the data transmitted.
163.934	Of course the question is:
166.084	can we receive very fast and subtle
166.084	changes of the brightness,
170.268	such as the ones transmitted
170.268	by our LED lights?
174.641	And the answer to that is yes, we can.
178.637	We have shown in the lab
180.44	that we can receive up to 50
180.44	megabytes per second
183.946	from a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell.
186.921	And this is faster than most
186.921	broadband connections these days.
191.437	Now let me show you in practice.
197.095	In this box is a standard,
197.095	off-the-shelf LED lamp.
203.193	This is a standard,
203.193	off-the-shelf solar cell;
205.792	it is connected to the laptop.
208.949	And also we have an instrument here
211.293	to visualize the energy
211.293	we harvest from the solar cell.
215.095	And this instrument shows
215.095	something at the moment.
217.917	This is because the solar cell already
217.917	harvests light from the ambient light.
223.102	Now what I would like to do first
223.102	is switch on the light,
225.966	and I'll simply, only switch on the light,
228.096	for a moment,
230.228	and what you'll notice is that
230.228	the instrument jumps to the right.
234.904	So the solar cell, for a moment,
236.618	is harvesting energy
236.618	from this artificial light source.
240.54	If I turn it off, we see it drops.
243.842	I turn it on ...
245.049	So we harvest energy with the solar cell.
248.586	But next I would like to activate
248.586	the streaming of the video.
255.418	And I've done this
255.418	by pressing this button.
257.766	So now this LED lamp here
257.766	is streaming a video
262.513	by changing the brightness of the LED
262.513	in a very subtle way,
266.669	and in a way that you can't
266.669	recognize with your eye,
269.191	because the changes
269.191	are too fast to recognize.
273.384	But in order to prove the point,
275.807	I can block the light of the solar cell.
280.087	So first you notice
280.087	the energy harvesting drops
283.334	and the video stops as well.
285.05	If I remove the blockage,
285.05	the video will restart.
289.357	(Applause)
295.61	And I can repeat that.
297.967	So we stop the transmission of the video
297.967	and energy harvesting stops as well.
303.242	So that is to show that the solar cell
303.242	acts as a receiver.
308.079	But now imagine that this LED lamp
308.079	is a street light, and there's fog.
314.106	And so I want to simulate fog,
316.433	and that's why I brought
316.433	a handkerchief with me.
319.2	(Laughter)
320.656	And let me put the handkerchief
320.656	over the solar cell.
325.905	First you notice
327.557	the energy harvested drops, as expected,
331.778	but now the video still continues.
334.769	This means, despite the blockage,
337.412	there's sufficient light coming through
337.412	the handkerchief to the solar cell,
341.317	so that the solar cell is able to decode
341.317	and stream that information,
346.856	in this case, a high-definition video.
351.04	What's really important here is that
351.04	a solar cell has become a receiver
356.627	for high-speed wireless signals
356.627	encoded in light,
360.466	while it maintains its primary function
360.466	as an energy-harvesting device.
365.872	That's why it is possible
368.315	to use existing solar cells
368.315	on the roof of a hut
372.196	to act as a broadband receiver
374.713	from a laser station on a close by hill,
374.713	or indeed, lamp post.
379.605	And It really doesn't matter
379.605	where the beam hits the solar cell.
383.647	And the same is true
384.849	for translucent solar cells
384.849	integrated into windows,
388.666	solar cells integrated
388.666	into street furniture,
392.222	or indeed, solar cells integrated
392.222	into these billions of devices
396.789	that will form the Internet of Things.
398.889	Because simply,
400.071	we don't want to charge
400.071	these devices regularly,
402.586	or worse, replace the batteries
402.586	every few months.
406.418	As I said to you,
408.172	this is the first time
408.172	I've shown this in public.
410.514	It's very much a lab demonstration,
412.593	a prototype.
414.276	But my team and I are confident
414.276	that we can take this to market
417.594	within the next two to three years.
420.251	And we hope we will be able to contribute
420.251	to closing the digital divide,
425.568	and also contribute
426.79	to connecting all these billions
426.79	of devices to the Internet.
430.37	And all of this without causing
431.919	a massive explosion
431.919	of energy consumption --
434.395	because of the solar cells,
434.395	quite the opposite.
436.641	Thank you.
437.818	(Applause)
