15.756	As you might imagine, I'm absolutely passionate
17.249	about dance. I'm passionate about making it,
19.454	about watching it, about encouraging others
22.058	to participate in it,
23.927	and I'm also really passionate about creativity.
26.55	Creativity for me is something that's absolutely critical,
30.667	and I think it's something that you can teach.
33.052	I think the technicities of creativity can be taught
35.313	and shared, and I think you can find out things
37.479	about your own personal physical signature,
39.748	your own cognitive habits, and use that as
41.66	a point of departure to misbehave beautifully.
45.112	I was born in the 1970s, and John Travolta was big
49.515	"in those days: ""Grease,"" ""Saturday Night Fever,"""
51.986	and he provided a fantastic kind of male role model for me
54.663	to start dancing. My parents were very up for me going.
57.443	They absolutely encouraged me to take risks, to go,
60.305	to try, to try. I had an opportunity, an access
64.53	to a local dance studio, and I had an enlightened teacher
68.121	who allowed me to make up my own and invent
71.226	my own dances, so what she did was let me make up
74.22	my own ballroom and Latin American dances to teach
77.169	to my peers.
78.541	And that was the very first time that I found an opportunity
81.31	to feel that I was able to express my own voice,
84.195	and that's what's fueled me, then, to become a choreographer.
87.013	I feel like I've got something to say and something to share.
90.029	And I guess what's interesting is, is that I am now obsessed
93.606	with the technology of the body.
95.193	I think it's the most technologically literate thing that we have,
98.489	and I'm absolutely obsessed with finding a way
101.588	of communicating ideas through the body to audiences
104.886	that might move them, touch them,
107.039	help them think differently about things.
110.141	So for me, choreography is very much a process
112.743	of physical thinking. It's very much in mind,
116.152	as well as in body, and it's a collaborative process.
119.415	It's something that I have to do with other people.
121.241	You know, it's a distributed cognitive process in a way.
123.995	I work often with designers and visual artists,
126.593	obviously dancers and other choreographers,
129.201	but also, more and more, with economists,
133.572	anthropologists, neuroscientists, cognitive scientists,
137.878	people really who come from very different domains of
140.645	expertise, where they bring their intelligence to bear
143.638	on a different kind of creative process.
146.026	What I thought we would do today a little bit is
149.229	explore this idea of physical thinking,
151.49	and we're all experts in physical thinking.
153.291	Yeah, you all have a body, right?
154.669	And we all know what that body is like in the real world,
156.86	so one of the aspects of physical thinking
158.554	that we think about a lot is this notion of proprioception,
161.468	the sense of my own body in the space in the real world.
164.533	So, we all understand what it feels like to know
167.919	where the ends of your fingers are
169.272	when you hold out your arms, yeah?
171.269	You absolutely know that when you're going to grab a cup,
174.084	or that cup moves and you have to renavigate it.
175.994	So we're experts in physical thinking already.
177.952	We just don't think about our bodies very much.
179.988	We only think about them when they go wrong, so, when
183.093	there's a broken arm, or when you have a heart attack,
185.331	then you become really very aware of your bodies.
187.796	But how is it that we can start to think about using
190.083	choreographic thinking, kinesthetic intelligence, to arm
193.491	the ways in which we think about things more generally?
195.849	What I thought I'd do is, I'd make a TED premiere.
198.805	I'm not sure if this is going to be good or not.
201.108	I'll just be doing it.
203.083	I thought what I'd do is, I'd use three versions
205.17	of physical thinking to make something.
206.814	I want to introduce you. This is Paolo. This is Catarina.
209.93	(Applause)
212.778	They have no idea what we're going to do.
215.382	So this is not the type of choreography where
217.726	I already have in mind what I'm going to make,
220.07	where I've fixed the routine in my head
222.611	and I'm just going to teach it to them,
224.201	and these so-called empty vessels are just going to learn it.
226.51	That's not the methodology at all that we work with.
229.444	But what's important about it is how it is that they're
233.777	grasping information, how they're taking information,
235.824	how they're using it, and how they're thinking with it.
237.955	I'm going to start really, really simply.
239.403	Usually, dance has a stimulus or stimuli, and I thought
242.38	I'd take something simple, TED logo, we can all see it,
245.484	it's quite easy to work with, and I'm going to do something
247.833	very simply, where you take one idea from a body,
250.622	and it happens to be my body, and translate that
252.626	into somebody else's body,
254.818	so it's a direct transfer, transformation of energy.
258.172	And I'm going to imagine this, you can do this too if you like,
260.952	"that I'm going to just take the letter ""T"" and I'm going"
263.19	to imagine it in mind, and I'm going to place that outside in
266.065	"the real world. So I absolutely see a letter ""T"" in front of me."
269.969	Yeah? It's absolutely there.
271.374	I can absolutely walk around it when I see it, yeah?
274.354	It has a kind of a grammar. I know what I'm going to do
276.279	with it, and I can start to describe it, so I can describe it
279.214	very simply. I can describe it in my arms, right?
282.185	So all I did was take my hand and then I move my hand.
284.863	I can describe it, whoa, in my head, you know? Whoa.
287.05	Okay. I can do also my shoulder. Yeah?
289.358	It gives me something to do, something to work towards.
292.366	"If I were to take that letter ""T"" and flatten it down"
294.484	on the floor, here, maybe just off the floor,
297.42	all of a sudden I could do maybe something with my knee,
298.893	yeah? Whoa. So If I put the knee and the arms together,
301.444	I've got something physical, yeah? And I can start to build something.
305.004	So what I'm going to do just for one and a half minutes or so
307.465	is I'm going to take that concept, I'm going to make something,
310.065	and the dancers behind me are going to interpret it,
312.943	they're going to snapshot it, they're going to take
314.587	aspects of it, and it's almost like I'm offloading memory
317.566	and they're holding onto memory? Yeah?
319.682	And we'll see what we come up with.
321.086	So just have a little watch about how they're, how they're
323.241	accessing this and what they're doing,
324.549	"and I'm just going to take this letter ""T,"" the letter ""E,"""
326.51	"and the letter ""D,"" to make something. Okay. Here goes."
329.541	So I have to get myself in the zone. Right.
347.137	It's a bit of a cross of my arm.
355.698	"So all I'm doing is exploring this space of ""T"""
360.349	and flashing through it with some action.
365.664	I'm not remembering what I'm doing.
368.067	"I'm just working on my task. My task is this ""T."""
370.83	Going to watch it from the side, whoa.
376.207	Strike moment.
378.077	That's it.
383.049	So we're starting to build a phrase.
387.391	So what they're doing, let's see, something like that,
389.344	so what they're doing is grasping aspects of that movement
392.491	and they're generating it into a phrase.
394.396	You can see the speed is extremely quick, yeah?
396.654	I'm not asking them to copy exactly.
398.944	They're using the information that they receive
401.301	to generate the beginnings of a phrase.
404.617	I can watch that and that can tell me something
406.538	about how it is that they're moving.
409.291	Yeah, they're super quick, right?
412.371	So I've taken this aspect of TED and translated it
416.155	into something that's physical.
420.876	Some dancers, when they're watching action,
423.46	take the overall shape, the arc of the movement,
425.935	the kinetic sense of the movement,
428.04	and use that for memory.
429.635	Some work very much in specific detail.
431.918	They start with small little units and build it up.
435.736	Okay, you've got something? One more thing.
453.272	So they're solving this problem for me,
456.42	having a little --
460.253	They're constructing that phrase.
462.114	They have something and they're going to hold on to it,
463.59	yeah? One way of making.
465.613	That's going to be my beginning in this world premiere.
467.969	Okay. From there I'm going to do a very different thing.
469.943	So basically I'm going to make a duet.
472.659	I want you to think about them as architectural objects,
476.154	so what they are, are just pure lines.
478.45	They're no longer people, just pure lines, and I'm going
481.006	to work with them almost as objects to think with, yeah?
485.231	So what I'm thinking about is taking
487.708	a few physical extensions from the body as I move, and
491.633	I move them, and I do that by suggesting things to them:
493.931	If, then; if, then. Okay, so here we go.
497.108	Just grab this arm.
498.284	Can you place that down into the floor?
501.309	Yeah, down to the floor. Can you go underneath?
503.515	Yeah. Cat, can you put leg over that side? Yeah.
507.332	Can you rotate?
508.781	Whoom, just go back to the beginning.
509.897	Here we go, ready? And ... bam, bake ... (clicks metronome)
516.245	Great. Okay, from there, you're both getting up.
518.169	You're both getting up. Here we go. Good, now? Them.
521.709	(Applause)
523.278	So from there, from there, we're both getting up,
525.979	we're both getting up, going in this direction,
527.222	going underneath. Whoa, whoa, underneath.
529.56	Whoa, underneath, whoo-um. Yeah? Underneath. Jump.
533.524	Underneath. Jump. Paolo, kick. Don't care where. Kick.
537.706	Kick, replace, change a leg. Kick, replace, change the leg.
541.125	Yeah? Okay? Cat, almost get his head. Almost get his head.
544.834	Whoaa. Just after it, maybe. Whoaa, whaaay, ooh.
549.699	Grab her waist, come up back into her first, whoom, spin,
554.017	turn her, whoo-aa. (Snaps) Great.
555.623	Okay, let's have a little go from the beginning of that.
557.982	Just, let me slow down here. Fancy having eight -- (Laughter)
563.491	Fancy having eight hours with me in a day.
566.293	So, maybe too much. So, here we go, ready, and -- (Clicks metronome)
570.799	(Clicks metronome)
578.382	Nice, good job. Yeah? Okay. (Applause)
581.523	Okay, not bad. (Applause) A little bit more?
584.521	Yeah. Just a little bit more, here we go, from that place.
587.313	Separate. Face the front. Separate. Face the front.
589.786	Imagine that there's a circle in front of you, yeah?
592.011	Avoid it. Avoid it. Whoom. Kick it out of the way.
596.906	Kick it out of the way. Throw it into the audience. Whoom.
600.995	Throw it into the audience again.
602.038	We've got mental architecture, we're sharing it,
603.92	therefore solving a problem. They're enacting it.
605.812	Let me just see that a little bit. Ready, and go.
607.995	(Clicks metronome)
612.498	Okay, brilliant. Okay, here we go. From the beginning,
614.163	can we do our phrases first? And then that.
617.101	And we're going to build something now, organize it,
618.79	the phrases. Here we go. Nice and slow?
620.439	Ready and go ... um. (Clicks metronome)
623.841	(Clicks metronome)
628.237	The duet starts. (Clicks metronome)
631.921	(Clicks metronome)
645.247	So yeah, okay, good. Okay, nice, very nice. (Applause)
648.684	So good. So -- (Applause)
650.394	Okay. So that was -- (Applause)
653.641	Well done. (Applause)
655.535	That was the second way of working.
657.094	The first one, body-to-body transfer, yeah,
659.466	with an outside mental architecture that I work with
662.214	that they hold memory with for me.
664.286	The second one, which is using them as objects to think
666.524	with their architectural objects, I do a series of
668.292	"provocations, I say, ""If this happens, then that."
670.765	"If this, if that happens -- "" I've got lots of methods like that,"
673.12	but it's very, very quick, and this is a third method.
675.751	They're starting it already, and this is a task-based method,
678.505	where they have the autonomy to make
680.186	all of the decisions for themselves.
681.992	So I'd like us just to do, we're going to do a little
683.251	mental dance, a little, in this little one minute,
686.673	so what I'd love you to do is imagine,
688.572	you can do this with your eyes closed, or open, and if you
690.673	don't want to do it you can watch them, it's up to you.
693.151	"Just for a second, think about that word ""TED"" in front of"
696.891	you, so it's in mind, and it's there right in front of your mind.
700.192	What I'd like you to do is transplant that outside
702.429	"into the real world, so just imagine that word ""TED"""
705.972	in the real world.
708.305	What I'd like you to do what that is take an aspect of it.
711.245	"I'm going to zone in on the ""E,"" and I'm going to"
714.385	"scale that ""E"" so it's absolutely massive,"
717.032	"so I'm scaling that ""E"" so it's absolutely massive,"
719.744	and then I'm going to give it dimensionality.
720.915	I'm going to think about it in 3D space. So now,
723.167	instead of it just being a letter that's in front of me,
725.64	it's a space that my body can go inside of.
728.521	I now decide where I'm going to be in that space,
731.238	so I'm down on this small part of the bottom rib
735.709	"of the letter ""E,"" and I'm thinking about it, and I'm imagining"
738.577	this space that's really high and above. If I asked you to
742.031	reach out — you don't have to literally do it, but in mind —
744.788	"reach out to the top of the ""E,"" where would you reach?"
747.838	If you reach with your finger, where would it be?
749.816	If you reach with your elbow, where would it be?
752.708	If I already then said about that space that you're in,
756.605	let's infuse it with the color red, what does that do
758.964	to the body? If I then said to you, what happens if
761.69	"that whole wall on the side of ""E"" collapses and you have to"
764.964	use your weight to put it back up,
766.81	what would you be able to do with it?
769.234	So this is a mental picture, I'm describing a mental,
771.131	vivid picture that enables dancers to make choices
775.136	for themselves about what to make.
777.517	Okay, you can open your eyes if you had them closed.
778.952	So the dancers have been working on them.
780.326	So just keep working on them for a little second.
782.182	So they've been working on those mental architectures in the here.
785.198	I know, I think we should keep them as a surprise.
787.7	So here goes, world premiere dance. Yeah? Here we go.
790.28	TED dance. Okay. Here it comes. I'm going to organize it quickly.
793.801	So, you're going to do the first solo that we made,
797.085	yeah blah blah blah blah, we go into the duet, yeah,
799.884	blah blah blah blah. The next solo, blah blah blah blah,
803.634	yeah, and both at the same time, you do the last solutions.
807.358	Okay? Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, world premiere,
809.9	TED dance, three versions of physical thinking. (Applause)
812.668	Well, clap afterwards, let's see if it's any good, yeah? (Laughter)
815.364	So yeah, let's clap -- yeah, let's clap afterwards.
817.863	Here we go. Catarina, big moment, here we go, one.
820.025	(Clicks metronome)
845.406	Here it comes, Cat. (Clicks metronome)
850.617	Paolo, go. (Clicks metronome) Last you solo.
855.053	The one you made. (Clicks metronome)
858.462	(Clicks metronome)
870.264	Well done. Okay, good. Super. So --
872.223	(Applause)
874.104	So -- (Applause)
876.395	Thank you. (Applause)
878.186	So -- three versions. (Applause) Oh. (Laughs)
887.171	(Applause) Three versions of physical thinking, yeah?
890.152	Three versions of physical thinking. I'm hoping that today,
893.111	what you're going to do is go away and make a dance
894.685	for yourself, and if not that,
896.638	at least misbehave more beautifully, more often.
898.865	Thank you very much. (Applause)
901.483	Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
906.213	Here we go. (Applause)
908.524	(Applause)
