15.26	I want you now to imagine
18.26	a wearable robot
21.26	that gives you superhuman abilities,
25.26	or another one that takes wheelchair users
29.26	up standing and walking again.
33.26	We at Berkeley Bionics
36.26	call these robots exoskeletons.
40.26	These are nothing else
42.26	than something that you put on in the morning,
45.26	and it will give you extra strength,
48.26	and it will further enhance your speed,
52.26	and it will help you, for instance, to manage your balance.
56.26	It is actually the true integration
60.26	of the man and the machine.
62.26	But not only that --
64.26	it will integrate and network you
66.26	to the universe
68.26	and other devices out there.
70.26	This is just not some blue sky thinking.
73.26	To show you now what we are working on
76.26	by starting out talking about
78.26	the American soldier,
80.26	that on average does carry about 100 lbs. on their backs,
84.26	and they are being asked to carry more equipment.
87.26	Obviously, this is resulting
90.26	in some major complications --
92.26	back injuries, 30 percent of them --
96.26	chronic back injuries.
98.26	So we thought we would look at this challenge
101.26	and create an exoskeleton
104.26	that would help deal with this issue.
108.26	So let me now introduce to you HULC --
112.26	or the Human Universal
114.26	Load Carrier.
117.26	Soldier: With the HULC exoskeleton,
119.26	I can carry 200 lbs. over varied terrain
121.26	for many hours.
123.26	Its flexible design allows for deep squats,
125.26	crawls and high-agility movements.
128.26	It senses what I want to do, where I want to go,
131.26	and then augments my strength and endurance.
137.26	Eythor Bender: We are ready with our industry partner
140.26	to introduce this device,
142.26	this new exoskeleton this year.
145.26	So this is for real.
147.26	Now let's turn our heads
150.26	towards the wheelchair users,
153.26	something that I'm particularly passionate about.
156.26	There are 68 million people
158.26	estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide.
161.26	This is about one percent of the total population.
164.26	And that's actually a conservative estimate.
167.26	We are talking here about, oftentimes,
169.26	very young individuals with spinal cord injuries,
172.26	that in the prime of their life -- 20s, 30s, 40s --
175.26	hit a wall
177.26	and the wheelchair's the only option.
179.26	But it is also the aging population
181.26	that is multiplying in numbers.
184.26	And the only option, pretty much --
187.26	when it's stroke or other complications --
189.26	is the wheelchair.
191.26	And that is actually for the last 500 years,
195.26	since its very successful introduction, I must say.
199.26	So we thought we would start
201.26	writing a brand new chapter
204.26	of mobility.
207.26	Let me now introduce you to eLEGS
210.26	that is worn by Amanda Boxtel
214.26	that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured,
218.26	and as a result of that
220.26	she has not been able to walk
222.26	for 19 years until now.
225.26	(Applause)
228.26	Amanda Boxtel: Thank you.
230.26	(Applause)
235.26	EB: Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set.
239.26	It has sensors.
242.26	It's completely non-invasive,
244.26	sensors in the crutches
246.26	that send signals back to our onboard computer
249.26	that is sitting here at her back.
252.26	There are battery packs here as well
254.26	that power motors that are sitting at her hips,
257.26	as well as her knee joints,
259.26	that move her forward
261.26	in this kind of smooth and very natural gait.
268.26	AB: I was 24 years old
270.26	and at the top of my game
272.26	when a freak summersault while downhill skiing
275.26	paralyzed me.
277.26	In a split second,
279.26	I lost all sensation and movement
282.26	below my pelvis.
285.26	Not long afterwards,
287.26	a doctor strode into my hospital room,
290.26	"and he said, ""Amanda,"
292.26	"you'll never walk again."""
296.26	And that was 19 yeas ago.
299.26	He robbed
301.26	every ounce of hope
303.26	from my being.
305.26	Adaptive technology
307.26	has since enabled me
309.26	to learn how to downhill ski again,
311.26	to rock climb and even handcycle.
314.26	But nothing has been invented
318.26	that enables me to walk,
320.26	until now.
322.26	(Applause)
325.26	Thank you.
327.26	(Applause)
335.26	EB: As you can see,
337.26	we have the technology,
339.26	we have the platforms
341.26	to sit down and have discussions with you.
344.26	It's in our hands,
346.26	and we have all the potential here
350.26	to change the lives
352.26	of future generations --
354.26	not only for the soldiers,
358.26	or for Amanda here and all the wheelchair users,
362.26	but for everyone.
364.26	AB: Thanks.
366.26	(Applause)
