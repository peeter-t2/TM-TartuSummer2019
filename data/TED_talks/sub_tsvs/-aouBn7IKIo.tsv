19.555	For any of you who have visited
19.555	or lived in New York City,
23.221	these shots might start to look familiar.
28.116	This is Central Park,
29.8	one of the most beautifully designed
31.536	public spaces in America.
34.432	But to anyone who hasn't visited,
36.934	these images can't really fully convey.
40.565	To really understand Central Park,
42.61	you have to physically be there.
45.769	Well, the same is true of the music,
49.874	which my brother and I composed and mapped
52.671	specifically for Central Park.
55.757	(Music)
60.815	I'd like to talk to you today a little bit about the work
63.641	that my brother Hays and I are doing --
66.798	That's us there. That's both of us actually â€”
70.244	specifically about a concept that we've been
70.244	developing over the last few years,
74.051	this idea of location-aware music.
77.66	Now, my brother and I, we're musicians
79.614	and music producers.
81.253	We've been working together since,
82.889	well, since we were kids, really.
84.901	But recently, we've become
84.901	more and more interested
87.5	in projects where art
89.42	and technology intersect,
92.248	from creating sight-specific audio
94.475	and video installation
96.347	to engineering interactive concerts.
99.349	But today I want to focus on this concept
101.996	of composition for physical space.
105.738	But before I go too much further into that,
108.187	let me tell you a little bit about how we got started
109.9	with this idea.
111.737	My brother and I were living in New York City
113.792	when the artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude
115.579	did their temporary installation, The Gates,
117.808	in Central Park.
119.629	Hundreds of these brightly-colored sculptures
121.273	decorated the park for a number of weeks,
124.475	and unlike work that's exhibited
126.407	in a more neutral space,
127.955	like on the walls of a gallery or a museum,
131.11	this was work that was really in dialogue
133.421	with this place,
134.801	and in a lot of ways, The Gates
136.733	was really a celebration
138.189	of Frederick Olmsted's incredible design.
140.922	This was an experience that stayed with us
143.184	for a long time, and years later,
145.453	my brother and I moved back to Washington, D.C.,
148.278	and we started to ask the question,
150.555	would it be possible,
152.319	in the same way that The Gates
153.76	responded to the physical layout of the park,
156.958	to compose music for a landscape?
161.8	Which brought us to this.
164.447	(Music)
169.369	"On Memorial Day, we released ""The National Mall,"""
173.005	a location-aware album
175.493	released exclusively as a mobile app
178.21	that uses the device's built-in GPS functionality
181.921	to sonically map the entire park
184.706	in our hometown of Washington, D.C.
190.46	Hundreds of musical segments
192.481	are geo-tagged throughout the entire park
195.742	so that as a listener traverses the landscape,
198.586	a musical score is actually unfolding around them.
201.995	So this is not a playlist or a list of songs
204.235	intended for the park,
206.79	but rather an array of distinct melodies and rhythms
209.786	that fit together like pieces of a puzzle
212.083	and blend seamlessly
213.646	based on a listener's chosen trajectory.
216.112	So think of this as
217.483	a choose-your-own-adventure of an album.
220.024	Let's take a closer look.
221.616	Let's look at one example here.
223.404	So using the app,
225.682	as you make your way towards the grounds
227.956	surrounding the Washington Monument,
229.778	you hear the sounds of instruments warming up,
233.989	which then gives way to the sound of a mellotron
236.997	spelling out a very simple melody.
241.759	This is then joined by the sound of sweeping violins.
247.595	Keep walking, and a full choir joins in,
251.992	until you finally reach the top of the hill
254.094	and you're hearing the sound of drums and fireworks
256.844	and all sorts of musical craziness,
259.13	as if all of these sounds are radiating out
261.943	from this giant obelisk that punctuates
263.783	the center of the park.
266.712	But were you to walk in the opposite direction,
269.501	this entire sequence happens in reverse.
274.872	And were you to actually exit
274.872	the perimeter of the park,
278.072	the music would fade to silence,
280.294	and the play button would disappear.
283.671	We're sometimes contacted by 
283.671	people in other parts of the world
286.719	who can't travel to the United States,
288.646	but would like to hear this record.
290.797	Well, unlike a normal album,
293.44	we haven't been able to accommodate this request.
295.728	When they ask for a C.D. or an MP3 version,
298.726	we just can't make that happen,
300.922	and the reason is because
303.1	this isn't a promotional app
305.085	or a game to promote or accompany
307.534	the release of a traditional record.
309.819	In this case, the app is the work itself,
313.553	and the architecture of the landscape
315.436	is intrinsic to the listening experience.
320.079	Six months later, we did a location-aware album
322.947	for Central Park,
324.488	a park that is over two times
324.488	the size of the National Mall,
327.76	with music spanning from the Sheep's Meadow
330.144	to the Ramble to the Reservoir.
333.556	Currently, my brother and I are working on
335.559	projects all over the country,
337.876	but last spring we started a project,
340.124	here actually at Stanford's
341.785	Experimental Media Art Department,
344.377	where we're creating our largest
344.377	location-aware album to date,
347.335	one that will span the entirety of Highway 1
349.425	here on the Pacific Coast.
351.715	But what we're doing, integrating GPS with music,
355.865	is really just one idea.
358.368	But it speaks to a larger vision
360.706	for a music industry that's sometimes struggled
362.855	to find its footing in this digital age,
365.687	that they begin to see these new technologies
368.152	not simply as ways of adding bells and whistles
370.397	to an existing model,
372.254	but to dream up entirely new ways
373.992	for people to interact with
375.709	and experience music.
377.451	Thank you.
379.495	(Applause)
