13.055	Picture it: a big, sweaty, tattooed man
16.708	in a cowboy hat and chaps,
18.389	is in the ring
19.567	as the arena full of fans cheer him on.
21.998	Their hero:
23.471	"""Cowboy"" Gator Magraw."
25.66	Gator bounces off the ropes
25.66	and is quickly body-slammed to the mat.
29.229	His wild opponent leaps into the air,
31.494	crashing down onto Gator's rib cage.
34.021	Gator struggles to breathe, wondering:
37.047	"""Is this really what my father"
37.047	"wanted for me?"""
39.873	(Laughter)
41.982	That wild man in the chaps ...
44.74	was me.
45.924	(Laughter)
47.008	(Applause)
48.673	(Cheers)
57.085	And the answer
57.085	to the question, surprisingly,
60.185	is yes.
61.368	(Laughter)
63.224	I grew up watching professional wrestling
65.527	with my dad.
67.252	And like him, I loved everything about it:
69.409	the showmanship, the athletic skill,
71.477	the drama.
73.062	I'd be this little boy, bouncing
73.062	all over our living room,
76.538	pretending to be my favorite
76.538	wrestlers from TV.
79.53	My dad actually reminded me
79.53	a little bit of Hulk Hogan,
82.185	but I was Hulk Hogan
82.185	and he was Andre the Giant.
84.764	I'd get all serious on him
84.764	"and say things like, ""Dad ..."
87.751	someday I am going to be
87.751	"world heavyweight champion."""
92.443	And he would usually smile
92.443	and very calmly say,
96.183	"""OK, then I guess I can count on you"
96.183	"to be my retirement fund."""
100.647	(Laughter)
102.019	When I was 16,
103.198	a small wrestling show came
103.198	to my little town in Minnesota.
106.071	I couldn't believe it.
107.265	Nothing like that had ever
107.265	come to my town before.
109.905	So I got to the arena
109.905	early in the morning the day of the show,
112.986	waiting out in the parking lot
112.986	to see if I could spot some wrestlers
116.249	pulling up in their cars.
118.121	It wasn't as creepy as it sounds.
121.229	But I could definitely tell
121.229	who the wrestlers were,
123.664	just the way they walked.
124.918	They were tall and confident
124.918	and intimidating,
127.126	with their tank tops
127.126	and Zubaz and fanny packs.
130.733	Why wouldn't I want to be them?
132.595	(Laughter)
133.852	All I could think about
133.852	was who are these people,
136.467	and what are they like?
137.941	How did they become wrestlers?
140.429	So before the show started,
141.739	I walked into this tiny arena --
144.03	more like a gymnasium --
145.843	and I asked them if I could help
145.843	set up the wrestling ring.
148.656	"""Sure, kid. No problem."""
151.203	And then I pleaded with them
151.203	to show me some wrestling moves.
154.264	"""Sure, kid. No problem."""
157.074	Man, they would just punch
157.074	and kick me -- hard!
159.65	But I never complained.
161.491	They would come to my town for one night
161.491	every couple of months that year,
165.051	and then -- poof! --
165.051	next day, they were gone.
167.248	By the next year,
168.43	they finally told me about an actual
168.43	wrestling training camp
171.319	that one of the wrestlers was running,
173.17	and I begged my parents to sign me up.
175.545	Next thing I knew,
175.545	I was a high school senior by day
178.437	and wrestling in front of live
178.437	audiences by night.
181.383	I had this giant poster of an alligator
181.383	hanging on my bedroom wall.
184.999	So when I needed to come up with
184.999	a wrestling name at the last minute
188.258	"and Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura"
188.258	was already taken --
190.582	(Laughter)
191.624	"I went with ""Gator."""
192.928	I also wrestled in a t-shirt
192.928	and camouflage pants
195.239	because that's what I had in my closet.
198.444	I hadn't quite figured out
198.444	how to develop my own persona yet,
201.364	but I was learning.
202.539	It was sort of like an apprenticeship.
204.397	But I was a wrestler.
205.588	And my dad would come to all my matches
207.584	wearing a t-shirt that said,
207.584	"""Papa Gator"" across the front."
210.487	(Laughter)
211.662	And he'd brag to his friends
213.024	about how his son was going to pay
213.024	for his retirement someday.
216.012	(Laughter)
217.059	And I would've.
219.768	Not long after I started wrestling,
221.469	my dad unexpectedly passed away.
226.254	And as you can imagine,
228.403	especially as a teenage boy,
230.483	it destroyed me.
234.913	If you've ever lost someone,
236.359	you know what a difficult
236.359	time that can be.
238.648	Your mind -- it's not working right.
241.142	The whole thing is just so surreal.
245.505	I wanted to feel normal again,
245.505	even if it was for just a second,
248.697	so I went back to wrestling
248.697	almost immediately.
251.813	Wrestling belonged to me
251.813	and my dad, you know?
255.278	So there I was,
256.681	sitting in the locker room,
258.05	getting ready for a match within days
258.05	of my dad passing away.
262.127	He was gone.
264.433	And sitting there alone --
267.532	it felt like I was hiding.
269.68	But it also felt like
269.68	I needed to be there.
273.23	One of the wrestlers who'd been
273.23	on the scene a long time
275.944	knew what I was going through,
277.427	and he came over to see
277.427	how I was holding up.
279.719	I couldn't get the words out.
281.419	"I just said, ""I don't know"
281.419	"what I'm doing."""
285.381	And then we just sat there in silence --
287.397	just ... silence.
291.123	Before he got up to get ready
291.123	for his own match,
293.406	he gave me this piece of advice
294.946	that would change the entire
294.946	direction of my life.
297.568	He told me the best wrestlers
297.568	"are just themselves, but ""turned up."""
303.058	He said successful wrestlers
303.058	find the traits within themselves
306.462	they're the strongest at
307.804	and make those the focus
307.804	of who they become in the ring.
311.902	So there I sat --
313.385	a scared teenager
313.385	who didn't know who he was
315.48	or why he was even wrestling anymore.
318.375	I looked around the locker room
318.375	at some of the other wrestlers,
321.396	and I thought,
322.594	"""I look so different."
322.594	"How can I ever be like them?"""
325.826	And then it hit me.
327.422	That's the moment I realized
327.422	I didn't have to be like them.
331.269	What I did have to do was find out:
331.269	What did it mean to be me?
334.699	What made me unique,
336.345	and how could I use it to my advantage?
339.005	I knew I wasn't a chiseled athlete
339.005	like some of these guys,
341.843	but I really didn't care.
343.157	So the first thing I thought was,
344.766	"""How can I amplify something as simple"
344.766	"as: comfortable with my own body?"""
349.37	I didn't know.
351.121	And then I thought:
353.353	Speedo.
354.542	(Laughter)
357.649	(Applause)
364.635	"Or ""trunks,"""
365.809	as we call them in wrestling.
367.904	Yeah, trunks.
369.078	I could be this big guy
370.262	who was comfortable
370.262	wearing these little trunks
372.537	in front of a bunch of strangers.
374.153	So I ditched the t-shirt
374.153	and camouflage pants,
376.34	and Gator's new wardrobe was born.
378.11	(Laughter)
379.487	I was also pretty good
379.487	at drawing cartoons,
381.586	so I wondered if I could turn that up.
383.869	I could design my own wrestling costumes,
386.291	so each pair of trunks would have
386.291	its own unique design and color,
389.563	all of them completely different --
391.76	and extremely comfortable, by the way.
393.886	(Laughter)
395.672	And I was also the funny kid in school,
397.634	believe it or not.
399.198	So I thought maybe I could turn that up.
401.84	Maybe I could go from the boy
401.84	who made his buddies laugh
405.752	to the man who could rally
405.752	hundreds or thousands.
408.81	So I committed to the idea
410.121	that my character wasn't going to be
410.121	as scary as some of the others.
413.416	I'd be hilarious from the moment
413.416	I walked into the arena.
416.256	With every wrestling match, I dug deeper.
419.14	I found out that I could laugh at myself.
421.167	So this guy would dance
421.167	and sing his entrance music
423.605	all the way to the ring.
425.142	That was dancing, by the way.
426.796	(Laughter)
428.137	I found out that I was an OK wrestler,
429.988	but I was an even better entertainer.
431.846	And turning myself up made me
431.846	unforgettable to the fans.
434.932	I was trying to find
434.932	those things about me --
437.135	the simple things that were special,
438.989	"and then ask, ""How can I turn them up?"""
441.884	Now, I knew I wanted my character
441.884	to be a man's man like my dad was.
445.586	"I thought, ""What's more"
445.586	"of a man's man than a cowboy?"""
450.427	And that's when Gator became
450.427	"""Cowboy"" ... Gator ..."
455.865	Yeah, I needed a last name.
457.77	I thought about it until my head hurt.
457.77	I couldn't come up with anything.
461.21	I'm sitting there watching TV one night,
461.21	flipping through the channels,
464.604	and this commercial comes on
465.976	about a country singer who had just won
465.976	an Entertainer of the Year award.
469.456	Tim McGraw.
470.638	He's a cool cowboy with a great last name.
472.669	And I liked his music.
473.868	It was just all part of my process.
475.899	But I just kept turning myself up
477.658	until I became Cowboy Gator Magraw!
482.304	(Laughter)
484.224	(Applause)
490.351	And I knew that if I kept
490.351	turning myself up
493.881	and pushing myself harder,
495.414	the opportunities would come.
497.971	And then it finally happened.
500.093	In the middle of the night,
501.495	I got a phone call.
504.235	It was the call I wish
504.235	my dad was around to hear.
508.415	The WWE,
510.099	the biggest wrestling
510.099	organization in the world,
512.863	wanted me to come and be a part
512.863	of Monday Night Raw.
516.435	Yes -- all of my hard work and miles
516.435	on the road were finally paying off.
522.14	I got to walk down the WWE Raw
522.14	entrance ramp on live television --
527.176	(Laughter)
529.046	dressed up as a fake security guard --
531.842	(Laughter)
532.874	to escort another wrestler to the ring.
534.851	(Laughter)
537.264	Sure, I was disappointed
537.264	I didn't get to wrestle,
539.65	but very few wrestlers get
539.65	any kind of call from the WWE.
542.587	Maybe one in a few hundred.
545.255	And becoming Cowboy Gator Magraw
545.255	is what got me there.
548.949	So instead of walking away that day,
551.733	I decided to turn myself up again
553.698	and become the best
553.698	security guard I could.
556.232	In fact, I did it so well,
557.756	I was the only guard to get
557.756	a close-up on TV that night.
561.725	That's a big deal, you know?
563.402	(Laughter)
566.503	And I got to sit backstage that entire day
568.921	with some of the most famous
568.921	pro wrestlers in the world,
571.643	some of which were heroes
571.643	of mine as a kid.
573.76	And I got to listen to them
573.76	and learn from them,
576.587	and for that day,
578.637	I was accepted as one of them.
581.831	Maybe my experience
581.831	with the WWE wasn't ideal.
584.634	I mean, I didn't get to wrestle.
586.838	But it made me work harder,
589.26	turning myself up louder year after year.
592.055	I was becoming the biggest
592.055	version of myself in the ring,
595.117	and other people took notice.
597.411	Before I knew it,
598.673	I'd gone from wrestling
598.673	maybe once a month in Minnesota
601.627	to as often as four times a week
601.627	all over the United States
604.575	on the independent wrestling circuit.
606.747	I was literally living my dream.
611.131	While wrestling over the next few years,
613.179	I suffered a pretty bad shoulder injury
615.109	right around the same time
615.109	my wife and I found out
617.502	that we were expecting our first child.
619.427	I know what you're thinking,
620.794	but believe me when I say
620.794	those two events are completely unrelated.
624.092	(Laughter)
630.168	But I needed shoulder surgery,
633.296	and I wanted to be home with my family.
635.763	It was my turn to be a dad.
638.383	So on July 27, 2007,
641.562	I wrestled my final match,
643.504	and walked away
643.504	from professional wrestling
645.55	to pursue the next chapter of my life.
648.268	And as time passed,
649.502	the strangest thing started to happen.
651.814	I found out that once someone
651.814	has been turned up,
654.193	it's pretty hard to turn them down.
657.035	I left the ring but Gator stayed with me,
659.047	and I use the turned-up version
659.047	of myself every day.
662.854	My beautiful wife has been with me
662.854	through this entire journey.
665.997	And by the way --
665.997	she does not like pro wrestling.
669.243	(Laughter)
670.488	Like, at all.
672.567	But she was always my biggest fan.
674.787	She still is.
676.621	She knows there's always going to be
676.621	some part of Gator Magraw in here,
680.066	and she wants our daughter and twin sons
680.066	to discover themselves
683.114	the way that I did,
684.297	but probably with fewer body slams
684.297	and steel chair shots to the head.
687.616	I mean, do you know how many times
687.616	she's had to remind me
690.331	not to clothesline the referees
690.331	at my kid's soccer games?
693.099	(Laughter)
694.138	I mean, it was just the one time,
695.766	and my daughter was clearly fouled!
697.468	(Laughter)
700.608	As a parent now, I've begun to realize
700.608	that my dad wanted something
703.879	much more valuable than a retirement fund.
706.092	Like most parents,
707.398	he just wanted his kids
707.398	to reach their fullest potential.
710.888	I'm trying to teach my children
712.463	that turning yourself up is just not some
712.463	perfect idea of how to be great,
716.108	it's a way of living --
717.829	constantly looking
717.829	for what makes you different
720.126	and how you can amplify it
720.126	for the world to see.
722.923	And by the way, my kids
722.923	don't like wrestling, either.
725.829	(Laughter)
726.963	But that's OK with me,
728.155	because they each have their own
728.155	unique talents that can be turned up
731.489	just like the rest of us.
732.827	My one son -- he's a whiz at electronics.
735.573	So maybe helping him turn up
735.573	makes him become the next Steve Jobs.
740.062	My other son and my daughter --
740.062	they're great at art,
742.855	so maybe helping them turn up their gifts
744.936	helps them become the next Pablo Picasso.
748.208	You never know what
748.208	you have the ability to do
750.471	until you dig.
752.669	And don't be afraid
752.669	to put yourself out there.
754.914	I mean, look around.
756.092	They say that if you get nervous
756.092	in front of an audience,
758.811	just imagine them in their underwear.
760.802	"But then I think, ""Hey,"
760.802	"I've wrestled in less."""
763.066	(Laughter)
764.993	(Applause)
773.272	Look, the wrestling circus doesn't need
773.272	to come to your town
776.186	before you get an invitation
776.186	to be the real you --
778.562	the bigger, more stunning
778.562	version of yourself.
781.25	It doesn't even necessarily
781.25	come from our parents.
783.995	Turning yourself up means looking inward
783.995	toward our true selves
787.253	and harnessing the voice that says,
788.992	"""Maybe, just maybe,"
791.015	"I am more than I thought I was."""
793.509	Thank you.
794.684	(Applause)
