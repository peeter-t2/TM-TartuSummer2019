13.04	I believe big institutions
15.08	have unique potential to create change,
17.72	and I believe that we as individuals
19.72	have unique power
21.04	to influence the direction
21.04	that those institutions take.
24.72	Now, these beliefs did not
24.72	come naturally to me,
27.08	because trusting big institutions,
29.68	not really part of my family legacy.
32.64	My mother escaped North Korea
34.76	when she was 10 years old.
36.64	To do so, she had to elude
36.64	every big institution in her life:
40.68	repressive governments, occupying armies
43.56	and even armed border patrols.
46.72	Later, when she decided she wanted
46.72	to emigrate to the United States,
50.44	she had to defy an entire culture
52.52	that said the girls would never
52.52	be the best and brightest.
56.68	Only because her name
56.68	happens to sound like a boy's
59.64	was she able to finagle her way
59.64	into the government immigration exam
62.92	to come to the United States.
65.6	Because of her bravery and passion,
68	I've had all the opportunities
68	that she never did,
70.88	and that has made my story so different.
74.08	Instead of running away
74.08	from big institutions,
76.48	I've actually run toward them.
78.32	I've had the chance
78.32	over the course of my career
80.6	to work for The Wall Street Journal,
82.44	the White House
83.68	and now one of the largest
83.68	financial institutions in the world,
86.68	where I lead sustainable investing.
88.84	Now, these institutions are like tankers,
91.28	and working inside of them,
92.72	I've come to appreciate
92.72	what large wakes they can leave,
96.36	and I've become convinced
97.68	that the institution
97.68	of the global capital markets,
100.44	the nearly 290 trillion dollars
100.44	of stocks and bonds in the world,
105.36	that that may be one
105.36	of our most powerful forces
108.24	for positive social change
108.24	at our disposal,
110.84	if we ask it to be.
112.92	Now, I know some of you are thinking,
114.8	global capital markets,
114.8	positive social change,
117.32	not usually in the same sentence
117.32	or even the same paragraph.
121.16	I think many people think
121.16	of the capital markets
123.52	kind of like an ocean.
124.84	It's a vast, impersonal,
124.84	uncaring force of nature
128.68	that is not affected
128.68	by our wishes or desires.
131.36	So the best that our
131.36	little savings accounts
133.72	or retirement accounts can do
135.44	is to try to catch some waves
135.44	in the good cycles
138.04	and hope that we don't get
138.04	inundated in the turbulent ones,
140.826	but certainly our decisions on how
140.826	to steer our little retirement accounts
145.08	don't affect the tides,
146.6	don't change the shape or size
146.6	or direction of the waves.
151.8	But why is that?
153.04	Because actually,
153.04	one third of this ocean of capital
156.4	actually belongs to individuals like us,
160.04	and most of the rest
160.04	of the capital markets
162.12	is controlled by the institutions
162.12	that get their power and authority
165.36	and their capital from us,
167.16	as members, participants,
167.16	beneficiaries, shareholders or citizens.
171.32	So if we are the ultimate owners
171.32	of the capital markets,
175.24	why aren't we able
175.24	to make our voices heard?
178.36	Why can't we make some waves?
180.96	So let me ask you a different question:
182.88	did any of you buy fair trade coffee
185.12	the last time you were
185.12	at a supermarket or at Starbucks?
187.8	OK. Do any of you go to the restaurant
190.24	and order the sustainably farmed trout
192.92	instead of the miso-glazed
192.92	Chilean sea bass
195.48	that you really wish you could have?
197.96	Do any of you drive hybrid cars
197.96	or even electric cars?
201.44	So why do we do these things?
203.56	Right? One electric car doesn't amount
203.56	to much in a fleet of 1.2 billion
207.44	combustion engine vehicles.
209.76	One fish is just one fish in the sea.
213.16	And one cup of coffee
215.36	doesn't amount to a hill of beans
215.36	in this crazy world.
219.4	But we do these things
219.4	because we believe they matter,
221.96	that our actions add up,
223.24	that our choices might influence others
225.16	and collectively,
225.16	what an impact we can have.
228.44	So, in my bag I have a coffee mug
228.44	that I bought a couple of years ago.
231.88	It's a reusable mug.
231.88	It has all these things printed on it.
234.84	Look at some of the things
234.84	that are on it, that it says.
237.96	"""This one cup can be used"
237.96	"again and again."""
240.52	"""This one cup may inspire others"
240.52	"to use one too."""
244.4	"""This one cup helps save the planet."""
246.72	I had no idea this plastic cup
246.72	was so powerful.
249.2	(Laughter)
250.32	So why do we think that our choice
252.24	of a four dollar shade-grown
252.24	fair trade artisanal cup of coffee
256.08	in a reusable mug matters,
258.28	but what we do with 4,000 dollars
258.28	in our investment account
261.066	for our IRA doesn't?
263.8	Why can't we tell the supermarket
263.8	and the capital markets
266.92	that we care,
268.36	that we care about fair labor standards,
270.64	that we care about sustainable
270.64	production methods
273	and about healthy communities?
274.88	Why aren't we voting
274.88	with our investment dollars,
277.92	but we would vote with our lattes?
280.52	So I think it has something
280.52	to do with the myths,
283.76	the fables that we all carry around
283.76	in our collective consciousness.
287	Do you remember the Grimm's fairy tale
287	about the magic porridge pot?
290.6	If you said to the pot,
290.6	"""Boil, little pot, boil,"""
293	it would fill up with sweet porridge.
295.32	"And if you said, ""Stop, little pot, stop,"""
297.44	it would stop.
299.44	But if you got the words wrong,
299.44	it wouldn't listen,
302.64	and things could go terribly awry.
305.64	So I think when it comes to markets,
307.4	we have a little bit
307.4	of a similar fable in our heads.
309.92	We believe that the markets
309.92	is this magic pot
312.28	that obeys only one command:
314.16	make more money.
316.92	Only those words said exactly that way
319.84	will make the pot fill up with gold.
322.64	Add in some extra words
322.64	"like ""protect the environment,"""
326	the spell might not work.
328.4	Put in the wrong words
328.4	"like ""promote social justice,"""
332.56	and you might see your gold coins shrink
334.6	or even vanish entirely,
334.6	according to this fable.
338.44	So we asked people,
338.44	what do you really think?
341.24	And we actually went out and polled
341.24	a thousand individual investors,
345.48	and we found something fascinating.
347.52	Overwhelmingly,
349.04	people wanted to add
349.04	those extra words into the formula.
355.76	they were interested
355.76	in sustainable investing,
358.36	which we define as taking the best
358.36	in class investment process
361.32	that you already have traditionally
363.08	and adding in the extra
363.08	information you get
365.16	when you think about the environment
365.16	and society and good governance.
	that companies who did that
373.88	would actually do better financially.
375.72	So people really do believe
375.72	that you can do well by doing good.
379.4	But here was the weird thing:
382.4	still said if they put their money
382.4	in those kinds of stocks,
386.6	they thought that they
386.6	would make less money.
389.88	So is it true?
391.52	Do you get less sweet porridge
391.52	if you invest in shade-grown coffee
395.32	instead of drinking it?
397.84	Well, you know, the investors
397.84	in companies like Burt's Bees
401.04	or Ben &amp; Jerry's wouldn't say so.
402.84	Right? Both of those started out
402.84	as small, socially conscious companies
406.84	that ended up becoming
406.84	so popular with consumers
410	that the giants Unilever
410	and Clorox bought them
413.08	for hundreds of millions of dollars
415.88	each.
417.84	But here's the important thing.
419.4	Those corporations realized
420.76	that if they wanted to protect
420.76	the value of their investments,
423.72	they had to preserve
423.72	that socially conscious mission.
426.24	If they didn't keep adding in
426.24	those extra words
428.48	of environmentally friendly
428.48	and socially conscious,
430.92	those brands wouldn't make more money.
434.44	But maybe this is just the exception
434.44	the proves the rule, right?
437.8	The serious companies
437.8	that fund our economy
440.36	and that fund our retirements
440.36	and that really make the world go round,
443.68	they need to stick to making more money.
446.96	So, Harvard Business School
446.96	actually researched this,
449.68	and they found something fascinating.
451.466	If you had invested a dollar 20 years ago
454.12	in a portfolio of companies
455.8	that focused narrowly on making more money
458.04	quarter by quarter,
460	that one dollar
461.44	would have grown
461.44	to 14 dollars and 46 cents.
465.32	That's not bad until you consider
467.6	that if instead
467.6	you'd invested that same dollar
470.64	in a portfolio of companies
472.32	that focused on growing their business
474.154	and on the most important
474.154	environmental and social issues,
478.04	that one dollar would have grown
480.24	to 28 dollars and 36 cents.
484.24	almost twice as much sweet porridge.
487.16	Now, let's be clear, they didn't make
487.16	that outperformance
490.16	by giving away money
490.16	to seem like a nice corporate citizen.
493.08	They did it by focusing on the things
493.08	that matter to their business,
496.32	like wasting less energy and water
498.76	in their manufacturing processes;
500.56	like making sure the CEO contracts
500.56	had the CEOs incentivized
503.96	for the long-term results of the company
503.96	and the communities they served,
507.44	not just quarterly results;
508.84	or building a first class culture
511.16	that would have higher employee loyalty,
513.52	retention and productivity.
516.48	Now, Harvard's not alone.
517.76	Oxford also did a research study
517.76	where they examined 120 different studies
521.8	looking at the effect
521.8	of sustainability and economic results,
525.28	and they found
525.28	time and time and time again
528.08	that the companies that cared
528.08	about these kinds of important things
531.96	actually had better
531.96	operational efficiency,
534.6	lower cost of capital
536.44	and better performance
536.44	in their stock price.
539.32	And then there's Al Gore.
540.88	So 20 years ago, when I worked
540.88	for Al Gore in the White House,
543.84	he was one of the early pioneers
543.84	pleading with businesses and governments
547.32	to pay attention to the challenges
547.32	of climate change.
550.04	Post-White House, he opened
550.04	an investment firm called Generation,
553.112	where he baked environmental
553.112	sustainability and other things
556.4	right into the core investment process.
558.84	And at the time there was
558.84	a good bit of skepticism about his views.
562.52	Ten years later, his track record
562.52	is one more proof point
566.28	that sustainable investing done right
566.28	can be sound investing.
570	Far from making less sweet porridge
571.88	because he added
571.88	sustainability into the mix,
574.28	he actually significantly
574.28	outperformed the benchmark.
577.56	Now, sustainable investing,
579.12	the good news is
579.12	it doesn't require a magic spell
582.92	and it doesn't require
582.92	some investment secret,
586.12	and it's not just for the elite.
587.72	It is not just about private equity
587.72	for billionaires.
591.24	It's not just groovy-sounding investments
591.24	like clean technology
594.217	or microfinance in emerging markets
595.937	or artisanal bakeries in Brooklyn.
599	It's about stocks and bonds
599	and Fortune 500 companies.
602.04	It's about mutual funds.
603.28	It's about all the things
604.76	we already see in the market today.
607.52	So here's why I'm convinced
609.52	that we collectively have the power
611.68	to make sustainable investing
611.68	the new normal.
615.56	First, the proof points
615.56	are coming out all the time
619.8	that sustainable investing done right,
621.84	preserving all the same
621.84	good principles of investing,
625.08	the traditional sphere, can pay.
627.52	It makes sense.
629.36	Secondly,
630.8	the biggest obstacle standing in our way
632.96	may actually just be in our heads.
635.52	We just need to let go of that myth
637.6	that if you add your values
637.6	into your investment thinking,
641.88	that you get less sweet porridge.
643.52	And once you get rid of the fable,
645.2	you can actually start appreciating
645.2	those facts we've been talking about.
648.68	And third, the future is already here.
650.68	Sustainable investment today
650.68	is a 20 trillion dollar market
653.68	and it's the fastest-growing segment
653.68	of the investment industry.
657.08	In the United States,
657.08	it has grown enormously, as you can see.
660.32	It now represents
660.32	one out of every six dollars
663.04	under professional management
663.04	in the United States.
666.4	So what are we waiting for?
669.16	For me, it goes back to the inspiration
669.16	that I received from my mother.
673.24	She knew that she wanted a life
674.8	where she would have the freedom
674.8	to make her own choices
678.28	and to have her voice heard
678.28	and write her own story.
681.52	She was passionate about that goal
684	and she was clear that she would let
684	no army, no obstacle,
687.64	no big institution stand in her way.
691.04	She made it to the States,
692.92	and she became a teacher,
694.68	an award-winning author
696.4	and a mother,
697.68	and ended up sending
697.68	her daughters to Harvard.
700.4	And these days, you can tell
700.4	that she is amply comfortable
703.52	holding court in the most powerful
703.52	institutions in the world.
707.6	It seems almost too prophetic
709.52	that her name in Korean means
711.84	"""passionate clarity."""
714.28	Passionate clarity:
715.96	that's what I think we need
715.96	to drive change.
718.76	Passion about the change
718.76	we want to see in the world,
722.12	and clarity that we are able
722.12	to help chart the course.
726.52	We have more opportunity today
726.52	than ever before
729.52	to make choices.
731.16	We have more power than ever before
731.16	to make our voices heard.
736.8	So change your perspective.
740.24	Vote with your small change.
741.96	Invest in the change
741.96	you want to see in the world.
745.8	Change the fables
747.6	and change the markets.
749.28	Thank you.
750.52	(Applause)
