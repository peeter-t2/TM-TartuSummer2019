13.309	Seventy-thousand years ago, our ancestors
13.309	were insignificant animals.
18.398	The most important thing to know
18.398	about prehistoric humans
22.521	is that they were unimportant.
24.497	Their impact on the world was not
24.497	much greater than that of jellyfish
29.655	or fireflies or woodpeckers.
32.643	Today, in contrast,
32.643	we control this planet.
36.853	And the question is:
38.219	How did we come from there to here?
41.666	How did we turn ourselves
41.666	from insignificant apes,
45.342	minding their own business
45.342	in a corner of Africa,
48.513	into the rulers of planet Earth?
51.876	Usually, we look for the difference
51.876	between us and all the other animals
57.59	on the individual level.
59.412	We want to believe -- I want to believe --
62.43	that there is something special about me,
66.002	about my body, about my brain,
69.152	that makes me so superior
69.152	to a dog or a pig, or a chimpanzee.
75.221	But the truth is that,
75.221	on the individual level,
78.506	I'm embarrassingly similar
78.506	to a chimpanzee.
82.029	And if you take me and a chimpanzee
82.029	and put us together on some lonely island,
87.288	and we had to struggle for survival
87.288	to see who survives better,
91.56	I would definitely place my bet
91.56	on the chimpanzee, not on myself.
97.419	And this is not something
97.419	wrong with me personally.
100.469	I guess if they took almost any one
100.469	of you, and placed you alone
104.619	with a chimpanzee on some island,
106.608	the chimpanzee would do much better.
110.823	The real difference between humans
110.823	and all other animals
115.032	is not on the individual level;
117.503	it's on the collective level.
119.518	Humans control the planet
119.518	because they are the only animals
124.348	that can cooperate both flexibly
124.348	and in very large numbers.
130.167	Now, there are other animals --
131.959	like the social insects,
131.959	the bees, the ants --
135.154	that can cooperate in large numbers,
135.154	but they don't do so flexibly.
140.099	Their cooperation is very rigid.
143.012	There is basically just one way
143.012	in which a beehive can function.
147.215	And if there's a new opportunity
147.215	or a new danger,
151.05	the bees cannot reinvent
151.05	the social system overnight.
155.617	They cannot, for example,
155.617	execute the queen
158.521	and establish a republic of bees,
160.451	or a communist dictatorship
160.451	of worker bees.
164.442	Other animals, like the social mammals --
166.809	the wolves, the elephants,
166.809	the dolphins, the chimpanzees --
170.707	they can cooperate much more flexibly,
173.477	but they do so only in small numbers,
176.842	because cooperation among chimpanzees
179.739	is based on intimate knowledge,
179.739	one of the other.
183.811	I'm a chimpanzee and you're a chimpanzee,
186.603	and I want to cooperate with you.
188.43	I need to know you personally.
191.049	What kind of chimpanzee are you?
192.843	Are you a nice chimpanzee?
194.28	Are you an evil chimpanzee?
195.957	Are you trustworthy?
197.425	If I don't know you, how can I
197.425	cooperate with you?
201.676	The only animal that can combine
201.676	the two abilities together
205.451	and cooperate both flexibly
205.451	and still do so in very large numbers
210.771	is us, Homo sapiens.
212.973	One versus one, or even 10 versus 10,
217.128	chimpanzees might be better than us.
220.112	But, if you pit 1,000 humans
220.112	against 1,000 chimpanzees,
225.315	the humans will win easily,
225.315	for the simple reason
228.957	that a thousand chimpanzees
228.957	cannot cooperate at all.
233.337	And if you now try to cram
237.412	into Oxford Street,
237.412	or into Wembley Stadium,
241.052	or Tienanmen Square or the Vatican,
243.608	you will get chaos, complete chaos.
246.249	Just imagine Wembley Stadium
246.249	with 100,000 chimpanzees.
250.616	Complete madness.
252.219	In contrast, humans normally
252.219	gather there in tens of thousands,
258.185	and what we get is not chaos, usually.
261.273	What we get is extremely sophisticated
261.273	and effective networks of cooperation.
268.554	All the huge achievements
268.554	of humankind throughout history,
273.168	whether it's building the pyramids
273.168	or flying to the moon,
276.475	have been based not
276.475	on individual abilities,
279.074	but on this ability to cooperate
279.074	flexibly in large numbers.
283.465	Think even about this very talk
283.465	that I'm giving now:
287.146	I'm standing here in front of an audience
287.146	of about 300 or 400 people,
293.154	most of you are complete strangers to me.
296.928	Similarly, I don't really know
296.928	all the people who have organized
301.936	and worked on this event.
303.994	I don't know the pilot
303.994	and the crew members of the plane
307.811	that brought me over here,
307.811	yesterday, to London.
311.286	I don't know the people
311.286	who invented and manufactured
315.033	this microphone and these cameras,
315.033	which are recording what I'm saying.
320.123	I don't know the people
320.123	who wrote all the books and articles
323.684	that I read in preparation for this talk.
326.495	And I certainly don't know all the people
329.329	who might be watching this talk
329.329	over the Internet,
332.572	somewhere in Buenos Aires or in New Delhi.
336.162	Nevertheless, even though
336.162	we don't know each other,
339.695	we can work together to create
339.695	this global exchange of ideas.
346.081	This is something chimpanzees cannot do.
349.156	They communicate, of course,
350.994	but you will never catch a chimpanzee
350.994	traveling to some distant chimpanzee band
356.817	to give them a talk about bananas
356.817	or about elephants,
360.961	or anything else that might
360.961	interest chimpanzees.
365.389	Now cooperation is, of course,
365.389	not always nice;
368.903	all the horrible things humans
368.903	have been doing throughout history --
372.952	and we have been doing
372.952	some very horrible things --
375.715	all those things are also based
375.715	on large-scale cooperation.
380.888	Prisons are a system of cooperation;
383.508	slaughterhouses are a system
383.508	of cooperation;
386.522	concentration camps
386.522	are a system of cooperation.
389.907	Chimpanzees don't have slaughterhouses
389.907	and prisons and concentration camps.
396.183	Now suppose I've managed
396.183	to convince you perhaps that yes,
400.037	we control the world because we can
400.037	cooperate flexibly in large numbers.
405.516	The next question that immediately arises
408.488	in the mind of an inquisitive listener is:
411.395	How, exactly, do we do it?
414.083	What enables us alone, of all the animals,
414.083	to cooperate in such a way?
421.714	The answer is our imagination.
424.998	We can cooperate flexibly
424.998	with countless numbers of strangers,
430.454	because we alone, of all
430.454	the animals on the planet,
434.174	can create and believe fictions,
434.174	fictional stories.
439.326	And as long as everybody believes
439.326	in the same fiction,
443.938	everybody obeys and follows
443.938	the same rules,
447.504	the same norms, the same values.
450.639	All other animals use
450.639	their communication system
454.562	only to describe reality.
457.59	"A chimpanzee may say, ""Look!"
457.59	"There's a lion, let's run away!"""
461.831	"Or, ""Look! There's a banana tree"
461.831	"over there! Let's go and get bananas!"""
465.961	Humans, in contrast, use their language
465.961	not merely to describe reality,
472.262	but also to create new realities,
472.262	fictional realities.
477.278	"A human can say, ""Look,"
477.278	there is a god above the clouds!
481.256	And if you don't do what I tell you to do,
483.36	when you die, God will punish you
483.36	"and send you to hell."""
486.986	And if you all believe this story
486.986	that I've invented,
490.782	then you will follow the same
490.782	norms and laws and values,
494.621	and you can cooperate.
496.278	This is something only humans can do.
499.207	You can never convince a chimpanzee
499.207	to give you a banana
503.072	"by promising him, ""... after you die,"
503.072	"you'll go to chimpanzee heaven ..."""
506.889	(Laughter)
507.936	"""... and you'll receive lots and lots"
507.936	of bananas for your good deeds.
511.222	"So now give me this banana."""
512.668	No chimpanzee will ever
512.668	believe such a story.
515.776	Only humans believe such stories,
518.49	which is why we control the world,
520.597	whereas the chimpanzees are locked up
520.597	in zoos and research laboratories.
526.904	Now you may find it acceptable that yes,
529.868	in the religious field, humans cooperate
529.868	by believing in the same fictions.
536.032	Millions of people come together
536.032	to build a cathedral or a mosque
541.008	or fight in a crusade or a jihad, because
541.008	they all believe in the same stories
546.774	about God and heaven and hell.
549.979	But what I want to emphasize
549.979	is that exactly the same mechanism
555.242	underlies all other forms
555.242	of mass-scale human cooperation,
561.13	not only in the religious field.
563.674	Take, for example, the legal field.
566.531	Most legal systems today in the world
566.531	are based on a belief in human rights.
573.247	But what are human rights?
575.596	Human rights, just like God and heaven,
575.596	are just a story that we've invented.
580.322	They are not an objective reality;
582.664	they are not some biological effect
582.664	about homo sapiens.
586.719	Take a human being,
586.719	cut him open, look inside,
590.542	you will find the heart, the kidneys,
590.542	neurons, hormones, DNA,
595.693	but you won't find any rights.
598.2	The only place you find rights
598.2	are in the stories
602.145	that we have invented and spread around
602.145	over the last few centuries.
606.607	They may be very positive stories,
606.607	very good stories,
611.561	but they're still just fictional stories
611.561	that we've invented.
615.664	The same is true of the political field.
618.565	The most important factors
618.565	in modern politics are states and nations.
625.333	But what are states and nations?
627.593	They are not an objective reality.
629.742	A mountain is an objective reality.
632.479	You can see it, you can touch it,
632.479	you can even smell it.
636.223	But a nation or a state,
638.019	like Israel or Iran or France or Germany,
641.823	this is just a story that we've invented
644.587	and became extremely attached to.
646.949	The same is true of the economic field.
649.892	The most important actors today
649.892	in the global economy
653.622	are companies and corporations.
656.407	Many of you today, perhaps, work
656.407	for a corporation,
660.162	like Google or Toyota or McDonald's.
663.577	What exactly are these things?
665.982	They are what lawyers call legal fictions.
670.359	They are stories invented and maintained
673.859	by the powerful wizards we call lawyers.
677.216	(Laughter)
678.685	And what do corporations do all day?
682.128	Mostly, they try to make money.
685.411	Yet, what is money?
686.768	Again, money is not an objective reality;
686.768	it has no objective value.
691.958	Take this green piece
691.958	of paper, the dollar bill.
695.299	Look at it -- it has no value.
697.7	You cannot eat it, you cannot drink it,
699.958	you cannot wear it.
701.633	But then came along
701.633	these master storytellers --
705.698	the big bankers,
707.206	the finance ministers,
708.67	the prime ministers --
710.048	and they tell us a very convincing story:
712.55	"""Look, you see this green piece of paper?"
714.532	"It is actually worth 10 bananas."""
717.591	And if I believe it, and you believe it,
719.724	and everybody believes it,
721.264	it actually works.
723.152	I can take this worthless piece of paper,
726.089	go to the supermarket,
727.75	give it to a complete stranger
727.75	whom I've never met before,
731.781	and get, in exchange, real bananas
731.781	which I can actually eat.
736.87	This is something amazing.
738.615	You could never do it with chimpanzees.
740.717	Chimpanzees trade, of course:
742.686	"""Yes, you give me a coconut,"
742.686	"I'll give you a banana."""
745.46	That can work.
746.722	But, you give me
746.722	a worthless piece of paper
749.738	and you except me to give you a banana?
751.776	No way!
752.952	What do you think I am, a human?
754.557	(Laughter)
756.954	Money, in fact, is
756.954	the most successful story
761.097	ever invented and told by humans,
763.777	because it is the only story
763.777	everybody believes.
768.692	Not everybody believes in God,
771.506	not everybody believes in human rights,
774.555	not everybody believes in nationalism,
777.364	but everybody believes in money,
777.364	and in the dollar bill.
781.514	Take, even, Osama Bin Laden.
783.519	He hated American politics
783.519	and American religion
787.23	and American culture,
788.703	but he had no objection
788.703	to American dollars.
791.533	He was quite fond of them, actually.
793.652	(Laughter)
796.166	To conclude, then:
797.89	We humans control the world
797.89	because we live in a dual reality.
804.531	All other animals live
804.531	in an objective reality.
808.992	Their reality consists
808.992	of objective entities,
813.568	like rivers and trees
813.568	and lions and elephants.
818.067	We humans, we also live
818.067	in an objective reality.
821.774	In our world, too, there are rivers
821.774	and trees and lions and elephants.
827.421	But over the centuries,
829.29	we have constructed on top
829.29	of this objective reality
834.041	a second layer of fictional reality,
837.558	a reality made of fictional entities,
841.146	like nations, like gods,
841.146	like money, like corporations.
846.481	And what is amazing is that
846.481	as history unfolded,
851.139	this fictional reality became
851.139	more and more powerful
856.559	so that today, the most powerful
856.559	forces in the world
861.084	are these fictional entities.
863.715	Today, the very survival of rivers
863.715	and trees and lions and elephants
870.533	depends on the decisions and wishes
870.533	of fictional entities,
875.662	like the United States, like Google,
875.662	like the World Bank --
880.223	entities that exist only
880.223	in our own imagination.
884.929	Thank you.
886.105	(Applause)
896.299	Bruno Giussani: Yuval, you have
896.299	a new book out.
898.533	After Sapiens, you wrote another one,
900.36	and it's out in Hebrew, but not
900.36	yet translated into ...
902.971	Yuval Noah Harari: I'm working on
902.971	the translation as we speak.
905.924	BG: In the book, if I
905.924	understand it correctly,
908.116	you argue that the amazing breakthroughs
908.116	that we are experiencing right now
913.769	not only will potentially
913.769	make our lives better,
916.052	but they will create -- and I quote you --
918.312	"""... new classes and new class struggles,"
918.312	"just as the industrial revolution did."""
922.954	Can you elaborate for us?
924.67	YNH: Yes. In the industrial revolution,
926.618	we saw the creation of a new class
926.618	of the urban proletariat.
931.544	And much of the political and social
931.544	history of the last 200 years involved
936.678	what to do with this class,
936.678	and the new problems and opportunities.
940.328	Now, we see the creation of a new
940.328	massive class of useless people.
944.984	(Laughter)
946.009	As computers become better and better
946.009	in more and more fields,
951.394	there is a distinct possibility that
951.394	computers will out-perform us
956.31	in most tasks and will make
956.31	humans redundant.
959.937	And then the big political
959.937	and economic question
962.698	of the 21st century will be,
965.085	"""What do we need humans for?"","
967.271	"or at least, ""What do we need"
967.271	"so many humans for?"""
970.662	BG: Do you have an answer in the book?
973.144	YNH: At present, the best guess
973.144	we have is to keep them happy
977.188	with drugs and computer games ...
979.009	(Laughter)
980.034	but this doesn't sound
980.034	like a very appealing future.
983.329	BG: Ok, so you're basically saying
983.329	in the book and now,
986.162	that for all the discussion
986.162	about the growing evidence
988.972	of significant economic inequality,
988.972	we are just kind of at the beginning
992.759	of the process?
994.225	YNH: Again, it's not a prophecy;
995.775	it's seeing all kinds
995.775	of possibilities before us.
999.742	One possibility is this creation
999.742	of a new massive class of useless people.
1004.748	Another possibility is
1004.748	the division of humankind
1007.912	into different biological castes,
1010.927	with the rich being upgraded
1010.927	into virtual gods,
1015.242	and the poor being degraded
1015.242	to this level of useless people.
1019.574	BG: I feel there is another TED talk
1019.574	coming up in a year or two.
1022.62	Thank you, Yuval, for making the trip.
1024.466	YNH: Thanks!
1025.646	(Applause)
