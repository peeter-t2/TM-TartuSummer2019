12.38	I'm going to speak to you
12.38	about the global refugee crisis
16.18	and my aim is to show you that this crisis
20.02	is manageable, not unsolvable,
23.78	but also show you that this is
23.78	as much about us and who we are
29.1	as it is a trial of the refugees
29.1	on the front line.
33.14	For me, this is not
33.14	just a professional obligation,
35.98	because I run an NGO supporting refugees
35.98	and displaced people around the world.
40.94	It's personal.
43.14	I love this picture.
45.74	That really handsome guy on the right,
47.86	that's not me.
49.58	That's my dad, Ralph, in London, in 1940
53.18	with his father Samuel.
55.74	They were Jewish refugees from Belgium.
58.26	They fled the day the Nazis invaded.
62.42	And I love this picture, too.
64.46	It's a group of refugee children
67.3	arriving in England in 1946 from Poland.
70.82	And in the middle is my mother, Marion.
74.46	She was sent to start a new life
77.5	in a new country
79.02	on her own
80.3	at the age of 12.
82.74	I know this:
84.38	if Britain had not admitted refugees
87.66	in the 1940s,
89.62	I certainly would not be here today.
94.06	Yet 70 years on,
94.06	the wheel has come full circle.
98.66	The sound is of walls being built,
101.7	vengeful political rhetoric,
104.22	humanitarian values and principles on fire
108.58	in the very countries
108.58	that 70 years ago said never again
112.5	to statelessness and hopelessness
112.5	for the victims of war.
118.42	Last year, every minute,
	from their homes
125.5	by conflict, violence and persecution:
128.98	another chemical weapon attack in Syria,
131.7	the Taliban on the rampage in Afghanistan,
135.18	girls driven from their school
135.18	in northeast Nigeria by Boko Haram.
141.62	These are not people
141.62	moving to another country
145.14	to get a better life.
147.1	They're fleeing for their lives.
150.9	It's a real tragedy
153.34	that the world's most famous refugee
153.34	can't come to speak to you here today.
159.06	Many of you will know this picture.
161.62	It shows the lifeless body
164.26	of five-year-old Alan Kurdi,
166.38	a Syrian refugee who died
166.38	in the Mediterranean in 2015.
170.86	He died alongside 3,700 others
170.86	trying to get to Europe.
176.26	The next year, 2016,
178.54	5,000 people died.
182.66	It's too late for them,
185.06	but it's not too late
185.06	for millions of others.
187.82	It's not too late
187.82	for people like Frederick.
190.46	I met him in the Nyarugusu
190.46	refugee camp in Tanzania.
193.98	He's from Burundi.
195.54	He wanted to know
195.54	where could he complete his studies.
198.14	He'd done 11 years of schooling.
198.14	He wanted a 12th year.
201.26	"He said to me, ""I pray"
201.26	that my days do not end here
205.9	"in this refugee camp."""
208.02	And it's not too late for Halud.
211.3	Her parents were Palestinian refugees
214.02	living in the Yarmouk refugee camp
214.02	outside Damascus.
217.3	She was born to refugee parents,
218.86	and now she's a refugee
218.86	herself in Lebanon.
222.34	She's working for the International
222.34	Rescue Committee to help other refugees,
226.66	but she has no certainty at all
229.66	about her future,
231.82	where it is or what it holds.
234.22	This talk is about Frederick, about Halud
238.14	and about millions like them:
240.14	why they're displaced,
242.1	how they survive, what help they need
242.1	and what our responsibilities are.
247.42	I truly believe this,
250.26	that the biggest question
250.26	in the 21st century
253.58	concerns our duty to strangers.
257.14	"The future ""you"" is about your duties"
260.42	to strangers.
262.26	You know better than anyone,
263.66	the world is more connected
263.66	than ever before,
268.339	yet the great danger
270.26	is that we're consumed by our divisions.
273.82	And there is no better test of that
276.1	than how we treat refugees.
278.66	Here are the facts: 65 million people
281.62	displaced from their homes
281.62	by violence and persecution last year.
284.86	If it was a country,
286.62	that would be the 21st
286.62	largest country in the world.
290.7	Most of those people, about 40 million,
290.7	stay within their own home country,
295.62	but 25 million are refugees.
297.22	That means they cross a border
297.22	into a neighboring state.
300.94	Most of them are living in poor countries,
304.98	relatively poor or lower-middle-income
304.98	countries, like Lebanon,
308.02	where Halud is living.
310.7	In Lebanon, one
310.7	in four people is a refugee,
315.38	a quarter of the whole population.
318.66	And refugees stay for a long time.
320.78	The average length of displacement
322.9	is 10 years.
325.14	I went to what was the world's
325.14	largest refugee camp, in eastern Kenya.
329.9	It's called Dadaab.
331.14	It was built in 1991-92
333.3	"as a ""temporary camp"""
333.3	for Somalis fleeing the civil war.
337.74	I met Silo.
339.54	And na√Øvely I said to Silo,
342.38	"""Do you think you'll ever"
342.38	"go home to Somalia?"""
345.7	"And she said, ""What do you mean, go home?"
348.14	"I was born here."""
350.54	And then when I asked the camp management
352.66	how many of the 330,000 people
352.66	in that camp were born there,
356.74	they gave me the answer:
361.66	That's what long-term displacement means.
365.26	Now, the causes of this are deep:
367.74	weak states that can't
367.74	support their own people,
370.66	an international political system
373.1	weaker than at any time since 1945
376.14	and differences over theology, governance,
376.14	engagement with the outside world
380.26	in significant parts of the Muslim world.
384.5	Now, those are long-term,
384.5	generational challenges.
387.7	That's why I say that this refugee crisis
387.7	is a trend and not a blip.
392.18	And it's complex, and when you have
392.18	big, large, long-term, complex problems,
396.74	people think nothing can be done.
399.94	When Pope Francis went to Lampedusa,
403.18	off the coast of Italy, in 2014,
404.78	he accused all of us
404.78	and the global population
408.1	of what he called
408.1	"""the globalization of indifference."""
412.58	It's a haunting phrase.
413.82	It means that our hearts
413.82	have turned to stone.
418.38	Now, I don't know, you tell me.
420.22	Are you allowed to argue with the Pope,
420.22	even at a TED conference?
424.7	But I think it's not right.
426.14	I think people do want
426.14	to make a difference,
428.26	but they just don't know whether
428.26	there are any solutions to this crisis.
431.98	And what I want to tell you today
433.82	is that though the problems are real,
433.82	the solutions are real, too.
437.62	Solution one:
438.98	these refugees need to get into work
438.98	in the countries where they're living,
442.58	and the countries where they're living
442.58	need massive economic support.
445.86	In Uganda in 2014, they did a study:
	in the capital city Kampala
451.42	needed no humanitarian aid
451.42	because they were working.
454.18	They were supported into work.
456.22	Solution number two:
458.02	education for kids
458.02	is a lifeline, not a luxury,
462.1	when you're displaced for so long.
465.3	Kids can bounce back when they're given
465.3	the proper social, emotional support
469.42	alongside literacy and numeracy.
471.18	I've seen it for myself.
474.5	But half of the world's refugee children
474.5	of primary school age
477.86	get no education at all,
479.86	and three-quarters of secondary school age
479.86	get no education at all.
483.26	That's crazy.
485.58	Solution number three:
488.1	most refugees are in urban areas,
488.1	in cities, not in camps.
491.58	What would you or I want
491.58	if we were a refugee in a city?
494.26	We would want money
494.26	to pay rent or buy clothes.
498.42	That is the future
498.42	of the humanitarian system,
500.62	or a significant part of it:
502.02	give people cash so that
502.02	you boost the power of refugees
504.7	and you'll help the local economy.
506.7	And there's a fourth solution, too,
508.7	that's controversial
508.7	but needs to be talked about.
511.46	The most vulnerable refugees
511.46	need to be given a new start
514.98	and a new life in a new country,
517.94	including in the West.
519.9	The numbers are relatively small,
519.9	hundreds of thousands, not millions,
524.14	but the symbolism is huge.
527.7	Now is not the time
527.7	to be banning refugees,
530.42	as the Trump administration proposes.
532.26	It's a time to be embracing people
532.26	who are victims of terror.
535.979	And remember --
537.22	(Applause)
544.3	Remember, anyone who asks you,
544.3	"""Are they properly vetted?"""
548.06	that's a really sensible
548.06	and good question to ask.
552.1	The truth is, refugees
552.1	arriving for resettlement
556.26	are more vetted than any other population
556.26	arriving in our countries.
559.94	So while it's reasonable
559.94	to ask the question,
562.1	it's not reasonable to say that refugee
562.1	is another word for terrorist.
566.94	Now, what happens --
568.18	(Applause)
571.58	What happens when refugees can't get work,
574.74	they can't get their kids into school,
576.62	they can't get cash,
576.62	they can't get a legal route to hope?
579.7	What happens is they take risky journeys.
582.26	I went to Lesbos, this beautiful
582.26	Greek island, two years ago.
587.02	It's a home to 90,000 people.
588.9	In one year, 500,000 refugees
588.9	went across the island.
593.06	And I want to show you what I saw
594.9	when I drove across
594.9	to the north of the island:
598.26	a pile of life jackets
598.26	of those who had made it to shore.
602.66	And when I looked closer,
604.26	there were small
604.26	life jackets for children,
606.74	yellow ones.
608.14	And I took this picture.
610.3	You probably can't see the writing,
610.3	but I want to read it for you.
613.46	"""Warning: will not"
613.46	"protect against drowning."""
617.74	So in the 21st century,
620.26	children are being given life jackets
622.54	to reach safety in Europe
624.7	even though those jackets
624.7	will not save their lives
628.06	if they fall out of the boat
628.06	that is taking them there.
632.62	This is not just a crisis, it's a test.
637.58	It's a test that civilizations
637.58	have faced down the ages.
641.38	It's a test of our humanity.
643.82	It's a test of us in the Western world
646.14	of who we are and what we stand for.
650.98	It's a test of our character,
650.98	not just our policies.
654.78	And refugees are a hard case.
656.98	They do come from faraway
656.98	parts of the world.
659.98	They have been through trauma.
661.9	They're often of a different religion.
664.02	Those are precisely the reasons
664.02	we should be helping refugees,
667.22	not a reason not to help them.
669.22	And it's a reason to help them
669.22	because of what it says about us.
674.3	It's revealing of our values.
676.94	Empathy and altruism are two
676.94	of the foundations of civilization.
683.14	Turn that empathy and altruism into action
685.58	and we live out a basic moral credo.
688.78	And in the modern world,
688.78	we have no excuse.
691.06	We can't say we don't know
691.06	what's happening in Juba, South Sudan,
695.18	or Aleppo, Syria.
696.78	It's there, in our smartphone
699.7	in our hand.
701.1	Ignorance is no excuse at all.
703.7	Fail to help, and we show
703.7	we have no moral compass at all.
708.9	It's also revealing about
708.9	whether we know our own history.
712.78	The reason that refugees
712.78	have rights around the world
715.3	is because of extraordinary
715.3	Western leadership
718.1	by statesmen and women
718.1	after the Second World War
720.46	that became universal rights.
723.46	Trash the protections of refugees,
723.46	and we trash our own history.
728.22	This is --
729.46	(Applause)
731.18	This is also revealing
731.18	about the power of democracy
735.22	as a refuge from dictatorship.
737.5	How many politicians have you heard say,
740.58	"""We believe in the power of our example,"
740.58	"not the example of our power."""
745.42	What they mean is what we stand for
745.42	is more important than the bombs we drop.
750.18	Refugees seeking sanctuary
752.62	have seen the West as a source
752.62	of hope and a place of haven.
758.54	Russians, Iranians,
761.3	Chinese, Eritreans, Cubans,
763.62	they've come to the West for safety.
767.3	We throw that away at our peril.
769.94	And there's one other thing
769.94	it reveals about us:
772.22	whether we have any humility
772.22	for our own mistakes.
775.14	I'm not one of these people
777.02	who believes that all the problems
777.02	in the world are caused by the West.
780.38	They're not.
781.62	But when we make mistakes,
781.62	we should recognize it.
784.7	It's not an accident
784.7	that the country which has taken
787.22	more refugees than any other,
787.22	the United States,
789.5	has taken more refugees from Vietnam
789.5	than any other country.
793.78	It speaks to the history.
796.02	But there's more recent history,
796.02	in Iraq and Afghanistan.
799.38	You can't make up
799.38	for foreign policy errors
803.14	by humanitarian action,
804.74	but when you break something,
804.74	you have a duty to try to help repair it,
808.66	and that's our duty now.
813.34	Do you remember
813.34	at the beginning of the talk,
815.5	I said I wanted to explain
815.5	that the refugee crisis
818.02	was manageable, not insoluble?
820.86	That's true. I want you
820.86	to think in a new way,
823.5	but I also want you to do things.
827.5	If you're an employer,
829.7	hire refugees.
832.26	If you're persuaded by the arguments,
835.1	take on the myths
836.62	when family or friends
836.62	or workmates repeat them.
840.26	If you've got money, give it to charities
842.54	that make a difference
842.54	for refugees around the world.
845.34	If you're a citizen,
847.86	vote for politicians
850.22	who will put into practice
850.22	the solutions that I've talked about.
853.86	(Applause)
858.1	The duty to strangers
860.3	shows itself
862.3	in small ways and big,
864.86	prosaic and heroic.
867.62	In 1942,
870.42	my aunt and my grandmother
870.42	were living in Brussels
872.82	under German occupation.
875.82	They received a summons
878.18	from the Nazi authorities
878.18	to go to Brussels Railway Station.
884.1	My grandmother immediately thought
884.1	something was amiss.
888.54	She pleaded with her relatives
891.06	not to go to Brussels Railway Station.
894.06	Her relatives said to her,
897.26	"""If we don't go,"
897.26	if we don't do what we're told,
900.06	"then we're going to be in trouble."""
902.58	You can guess what happened
904.54	to the relatives who went
904.54	to Brussels Railway Station.
907.98	They were never seen again.
909.98	But my grandmother and my aunt,
912.54	they went to a small village
915.1	south of Brussels
917.54	where they'd been on holiday
917.54	in the decade before,
921.1	and they presented themselves
921.1	at the house of the local farmer,
924.78	a Catholic farmer called Monsieur Maurice,
927.66	and they asked him to take them in.
930.7	And he did,
932.38	and by the end of the war,
	were living in that village.
940.18	And when I was teenager, I asked my aunt,
942.18	"""Can you take me to meet"
942.18	"Monsieur Maurice?"""
945.22	"And she said, ""Yeah, I can."
945.22	"He's still alive. Let's go and see him."""
948.46	And so, it must have been '83, '84,
951.14	we went to see him.
952.54	And I suppose, like only a teenager could,
955.38	when I met him,
956.66	he was this white-haired gentleman,
960.14	I said to him,
962.98	"""Why did you do it?"
965.22	"Why did you take that risk?"""
969.06	And he looked at me and he shrugged,
970.82	and he said, in French,
973.06	"""On doit."""
974.42	"""One must."""
976.1	It was innate in him.
978.94	It was natural.
980.22	And my point to you is it should be
980.22	natural and innate in us, too.
984.46	Tell yourself,
986.9	this refugee crisis is manageable,
989.42	not unsolvable,
991.02	and each one of us
993.14	has a personal responsibility
993.14	to help make it so.
997.06	Because this is about the rescue
997.06	of us and our values
1001.26	as well as the rescue
1001.26	of refugees and their lives.
1004.14	Thank you very much indeed.
1005.46	(Applause)
1016.94	Bruno Giussani: David, thank you.
1016.94	David Miliband: Thank you.
1019.82	BG: Those are strong suggestions
1021.42	and your call for individual
1021.42	responsibility is very strong as well,
1024.62	but I'm troubled
1024.62	by one thought, and it's this:
1026.86	you mentioned, and these are your words,
1026.86	"""extraordinary Western leadership"""
1030.9	which led 60-something years ago
1032.78	to the whole discussion
1032.78	about human rights,
1034.86	to the conventions on refugees, etc. etc.
1039.06	That leadership
1039.06	happened after a big trauma
1041.46	and happened in
1041.46	a consensual political space,
1045.46	and now we are
1045.46	in a divisive political space.
1047.62	Actually, refugees have become
1047.62	one of the divisive issues.
1050.38	So where will leadership come from today?
1052.98	DM: Well, I think that you're right to say
1055.46	that the leadership forged in war
1058.58	has a different temper
1058.58	and a different tempo
1060.86	and a different outlook
1062.14	than leadership forged in peace.
1065.38	And so my answer would be
1065.38	the leadership has got to come from below,
1069.14	not from above.
1070.62	I mean, a recurring theme
1070.62	of the conference this week
1073.98	has been about
1073.98	the democratization of power.
1077.82	And we've got to preserve
1077.82	our own democracies,
1080.02	but we've got to also activate
1080.02	our own democracies.
1082.54	And when people say to me,
1084.38	"""There's a backlash against refugees,"""
1086.26	what I say to them is,
1087.54	"""No, there's a polarization,"
1089.66	and at the moment,
1090.9	those who are fearful
1090.9	are making more noise
1092.924	"than those who are proud."""
1094.46	And so my answer to your question
1094.46	is that we will sponsor and encourage
1098.46	and give confidence to leadership
1100.26	when we mobilize ourselves.
1102.06	And I think that when you are
1102.06	in a position of looking for leadership,
1105.38	you have to look inside
1106.74	and mobilize in your own community
1108.46	to try to create conditions
1108.46	for a different kind of settlement.
1111.7	BG: Thank you, David.
