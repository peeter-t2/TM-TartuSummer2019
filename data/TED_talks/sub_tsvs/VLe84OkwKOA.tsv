12.949	I'd like to have you look at this pencil.
15.55	It's a thing. It's a legal thing.
18.407	And so are books you might have
18.407	or the cars you own.
22.319	They're all legal things.
24.258	The great apes that you'll see behind me,
27.881	they too are legal things.
31.549	Now, I can do that to a legal thing.
35.822	I can do whatever I want
35.822	to my book or my car.
38.631	These great apes, you'll see.
41.533	The photographs are taken by a man
41.533	named James Mollison
45.42	who wrote a book called
45.42	"""James &amp; Other Apes."""
48.464	And he tells in his book
48.464	how every single one them,
51.227	almost every one of them, is an orphan
53.525	who saw his mother and father
53.525	die before his eyes.
58.11	They're legal things.
59.748	So for centuries, there's been
59.748	a great legal wall
62.441	that separates legal things
62.441	from legal persons.
65.785	On one hand, legal things
65.785	are invisible to judges.
69.57	They don't count in law.
71.52	They don't have any legal rights.
73.215	They don't have
73.215	the capacity for legal rights.
75.699	They are the slaves.
77.836	On the other side of that legal wall
77.836	are the legal persons.
80.66	Legal persons are very visible to judges.
83.607	They count in law.
85.312	They may have many rights.
87.239	They have the capacity
87.239	for an infinite number of rights.
90.142	And they're the masters.
93.3	Right now, all nonhuman animals
93.3	are legal things.
97.779	All human beings are legal persons.
100.66	But being human and being a legal person
103.469	has never been, and is not today,
103.469	synonymous with a legal person.
109.112	Humans and legal persons
109.112	are not synonymous.
112.478	On the one side,
115.358	there have been many human beings
115.358	over the centuries
119.491	who have been legal things.
121.464	Slaves were legal things.
122.997	Women, children,
122.997	were sometimes legal things.
127.499	Indeed, a great deal of civil rights
127.499	struggle over the last centuries
131.146	has been to punch a hole
131.146	through that wall and begin to feed
135.659	these human things through the wall
135.659	and have them become legal persons.
140.713	But alas, that hole has closed up.
144.772	Now, on the other side are legal persons,
146.819	but they've never only been
146.819	limited to human beings.
150.952	There are, for example, there are many
150.952	legal persons who are not even alive.
154.94	In the United States,
156.547	we're aware of the fact
156.547	that corporations are legal persons.
160.54	In pre-independence India,
162.515	a court held that a Hindu idol
162.515	was a legal person,
165.139	that a mosque was a legal person.
167.2	In 2000, the Indian Supreme Court
169.63	held that the holy books
169.63	of the Sikh religion was a legal person,
173.173	and in 2012, just recently,
175.472	there was a treaty between
175.472	the indigenous peoples of New Zealand
179.233	and the crown, in which it was agreed
179.233	that a river was a legal person
182.484	who owned its own riverbed.
185.525	Now, I read Peter Singer's book in 1980,
188.776	when I had a full head
188.776	of lush, brown hair,
192.5	and indeed I was moved by it,
195.088	because I had become a lawyer because
195.088	I wanted to speak for the voiceless,
198.616	defend the defenseless,
199.851	and I'd never realized how voiceless
199.851	and defenseless the trillions,
204.263	billions of nonhuman animals are.
207.769	And I began to work
207.769	as an animal protection lawyer.
210.788	And by 1985, I realized that I was trying
210.788	to accomplish something
215.664	that was literally impossible,
217.591	the reason being that all of my clients,
220.215	all the animals whose interests
220.215	I was trying to defend,
223.697	were legal things; they were invisible.
226.182	It was not going to work, so I decided
228.102	that the only thing that was going to work
228.102	was they had, at least some of them,
232.066	had to also be moved through a hole
232.066	that we could open up again in that wall
235.864	and begin feeding the appropriate
235.864	nonhuman animals through that hole
239.44	onto the other side
239.44	of being legal persons.
242.986	Now, at that time, there was
242.986	very little known about or spoken about
248.426	truly animal rights,
250.794	about the idea of having legal personhood
250.794	or legal rights for a nonhuman animal,
255.235	and I knew it was going
255.235	to take a long time.
258.005	And so, in 1985, I figured that it
258.005	would take about 30 years
261.405	before we'd be able to even begin
261.405	a strategic litigation,
264.934	long-term campaign, in order to be able
264.934	to punch another hole through that wall.
270.716	It turned out that I was pessimistic,
270.716	that it only took 28.
278.801	So what we had to do in order
278.801	to begin was not only
285.24	to write law review articles
285.24	and teach classes, write books,
289.922	but we had to then begin
289.922	to get down to the nuts and bolts
292.89	of how you litigate that kind of case.
294.875	So one of the first things we needed to do
294.875	was figure out what a cause of action was,
298.908	a legal cause of action.
300.367	And a legal cause of action
300.367	is a vehicle that lawyers use
303.264	to put their arguments in front of courts.
308.84	It turns out there's
308.84	a very interesting case
311.744	that had occurred almost 250 years ago
311.744	in London called Somerset vs. Stewart,
316.348	whereby a black slave
316.348	had used the legal system
319.444	and had moved from a legal thing
319.444	to a legal person.
322.323	I was so interested in it that I
322.323	eventually wrote an entire book about it.
326.386	James Somerset was an eight-year-old boy
326.386	when he was kidnapped from West Africa.
331.773	He survived the Middle Passage,
334.72	and he was sold to a Scottish businessman
334.72	named Charles Stewart in Virginia.
339.894	Now, 20 years later, Stewart
339.894	brought James Somerset to London,
344.102	and after he got there, James decided
344.102	he was going to escape.
347.98	And so one of the first things he did
347.98	was to get himself baptized,
351.62	because he wanted to get
351.62	a set of godparents,
353.901	because to an 18th-century slave,
355.712	they knew that one of the major
355.712	responsibilities of godfathers
358.87	was to help you escape.
360.982	And so in the fall of 1771,
364.998	James Somerset had a confrontation
364.998	with Charles Stewart.
367.641	We don't know exactly what happened,
367.641	but then James dropped out of sight.
372.313	An enraged Charles Stewart
372.313	then hired slave catchers
375.309	to canvass the city of London,
377.55	find him, bring him
377.55	not back to Charles Stewart,
380.15	but to a ship, the Ann and Mary,
380.15	that was floating in London Harbour,
386.173	and he was chained to the deck,
387.793	and the ship was to set sail for Jamaica
389.797	where James was to be sold
389.797	in the slave markets
392.816	and be doomed to the three to five
392.816	years of life that a slave had
396.299	harvesting sugar cane in Jamaica.
399.15	Well now James' godparents
399.15	swung into action.
402.359	They approached the most powerful judge,
404.866	Lord Mansfield, who was chief judge
404.866	of the court of King's Bench,
408.512	and they demanded that he issue
408.512	a common law writ of habeus corpus
412.157	on behalf of James Somerset.
413.991	Now, the common law is the kind of law
413.991	that English-speaking judges can make
417.962	when they're not cabined in
417.962	by statutes or constitutions,
422.099	and a writ of habeus corpus
422.099	is called the Great Writ,
424.695	capital G, capital W,
426.762	and it's meant to protect any of us
426.762	who are detained against our will.
431.29	A writ of habeus corpus is issued.
433.263	The detainer is required
433.263	to bring the detainee in
435.701	and give a legally sufficient reason
435.701	for depriving him of his bodily liberty.
441.576	Well, Lord Mansfield had to make
441.576	a decision right off the bat,
446.57	because if James Somerset
446.57	was a legal thing,
449.354	he was not eligible
449.354	for a writ of habeus corpus,
452.419	only if he could be a legal person.
454.439	So Lord Mansfield decided
454.439	that he would assume,
457.457	without deciding, that James Somerset
457.457	was indeed a legal person,
461.56	and he issued the writ of habeus corpus,
461.56	and James's body was brought in
464.971	by the captain of the ship.
466.482	There were a series of hearings
466.482	over the next six months.
469.183	On June 22, 1772, Lord Mansfield
469.183	said that slavery was so odious,
475.011	"and he used the word ""odious,"""
476.845	that the common law would not support it,
476.845	and he ordered James free.
480.723	At that moment, James Somerset
480.723	underwent a legal transubstantiation.
484.883	The free man who walked
484.883	out of the courtroom
486.943	looked exactly like the slave
486.943	who had walked in,
489.191	but as far as the law was concerned,
489.191	they had nothing whatsoever in common.
494.79	The next thing we did is that
494.79	the Nonhuman Rights Project,
497.74	which I founded, then began to look at
497.74	what kind of values and principles
501.25	do we want to put before the judges?
504.128	What values and principles
504.128	did they imbibe with their mother's milk,
508.007	were they taught in law school,
508.007	do they use every day,
511.09	do they believe with all their hearts --
511.09	and we chose liberty and equality.
514.779	Now, liberty right is the kind of right
514.779	to which you're entitled
517.811	because of how you're put together,
520.152	and a fundamental liberty right
520.152	protects a fundamental interest.
525.489	And the supreme interest in the common law
528.724	are the rights to autonomy
528.724	and self-determination.
534.015	So they are so powerful that
534.015	in a common law country,
537.795	if you go to a hospital and you refuse
537.795	life-saving medical treatment,
542.393	a judge will not order it forced upon you,
544.64	because they will respect
544.64	your self-determination and your autonomy.
549.451	Now, an equality right is the kind
549.451	of right to which you're entitled
552.714	because you resemble someone else
552.714	in a relevant way,
555.61	and there's the rub, relevant way.
557.601	So if you are that, then because
557.601	they have the right, you're like them,
561.339	you're entitled to the right.
563.684	Now, courts and legislatures
563.684	draw lines all the time.
566.846	Some are included, some are excluded.
569.118	But you have to,
569.118	at the bare minimum you must --
575.26	that line has to be a reasonable means
575.26	to a legitimate end.
579.695	The Nonhuman Rights Project
579.695	argues that drawing a line
582.435	in order to enslave an autonomous
582.435	and self-determining being
585.742	like you're seeing behind me,
587.53	that that's a violation of equality.
591.27	We then searched through 80 jurisdictions,
593.82	it took us seven years,
593.82	to find the jurisdiction
596.065	where we wanted to begin
596.065	filing our first suit.
598.271	We chose the state of New York.
599.77	Then we decided upon
599.77	who our plaintiffs are going to be.
602.392	We decided upon chimpanzees,
604.258	not just because Jane Goodall
604.258	was on our board of directors,
607.109	but because they, Jane and others,
610.862	have studied chimpanzees
610.862	intensively for decades.
613.582	We know the extraordinary
613.582	cognitive capabilities that they have,
617.158	and they also resemble the kind
617.158	that human beings have.
620.292	And so we chose chimpanzees,
620.292	and we began to then canvass the world
625.424	to find the experts
625.424	in chimpanzee cognition.
628.256	We found them in Japan, Sweden, Germany,
628.256	Scotland, England and the United States,
632.761	and amongst them, they wrote
635.524	in which they set out more than 40 ways
638.32	in which their complex
638.32	cognitive capability,
641.12	either individually or together,
643.14	all added up to autonomy
643.14	and self-determination.
647.429	Now, these included, for example,
647.429	that they were conscious.
650.936	But they're also conscious
650.936	that they're conscious.
653.283	They know they have a mind.
653.283	They know that others have minds.
656.139	They know they're individuals,
656.139	and that they can live.
658.682	They understand that they lived yesterday
658.682	and they will live tomorrow.
661.975	They engage in mental time travel.
661.975	They remember what happened yesterday.
665.419	They can anticipate tomorrow,
666.87	which is why it's so terrible to imprison
666.87	a chimpanzee, especially alone.
671.587	It's the thing that we do
671.587	to our worst criminals,
674.184	and we do that to chimpanzees
674.184	without even thinking about it.
679.715	They have some kind of moral capacity.
682.426	When they play economic games
682.426	with human beings,
685.352	they'll spontaneously make fair offers,
685.352	even when they're not required to do so.
689.392	They are numerate.
689.392	They understand numbers.
691.425	They can do some simple math.
692.805	They can engage in language --
692.805	or to stay out of the language wars,
696.869	they're involved in intentional
696.869	and referential communication
700.234	in which they pay attention
700.234	to the attitudes of those
702.721	with whom they are speaking.
704.252	They have culture.
705.9	They have a material culture,
705.9	a social culture.
708.501	They have a symbolic culture.
710.916	Scientists in the Taï Forests
710.916	in the Ivory Coast
714.817	found chimpanzees who were using
714.817	these rocks to smash open
718.346	the incredibly hard hulls of nuts.
721.132	It takes a long time
721.132	to learn how to do that,
723.431	and they excavated the area
723.431	and they found
725.544	that this material culture,
725.544	this way of doing it,
728.377	these rocks, had passed down
728.377	for at least 4,300 years
731.72	through 225 chimpanzee generations.
736.712	So now we needed to find our chimpanzee.
739.104	Our chimpanzee,
742.284	first we found two of them
742.284	in the state of New York.
745.187	Both of them would die before
745.187	we could even get our suits filed.
748.391	Then we found Tommy.
750.272	Tommy is a chimpanzee.
750.272	You see him behind me.
753.384	Tommy was a chimpanzee.
753.384	We found him in that cage.
755.891	We found him in a small room
755.891	that was filled with cages
759.351	in a larger warehouse structure on a used
759.351	trailer lot in central New York.
764.537	We found Kiko, who is partially deaf.
766.711	Kiko was in the back of a cement
766.711	storefront in western Massachusetts.
772.353	And we found Hercules and Leo.
774.25	They're two young male chimpanzees
775.953	who are being used for biomedical,
775.953	anatomical research at Stony Brook.
779.366	We found them.
780.671	And so on the last week of December 2013,
783.383	the Nonhuman Rights Project filed three
783.383	suits all across the state of New York
787.323	using the same common law
787.323	writ of habeus corpus argument
790.801	that had been used with James Somerset,
793.529	and we demanded that the judges issue
793.529	these common law writs of habeus corpus.
798.616	We wanted the chimpanzees out,
800.727	and we wanted them brought
800.727	to Save the Chimps,
803.513	a tremendous chimpanzee
803.513	sanctuary in South Florida
807.461	which involves an artificial lake
807.461	with 12 or 13 islands --
812.548	there are two or three acres
812.548	where two dozen chimpanzees live
815.411	on each of them.
816.571	And these chimpanzees would then live
816.571	the life of a chimpanzee,
819.521	with other chimpanzees in an environment
819.521	that was as close to Africa as possible.
823.923	Now, all these cases are still going on.
828.82	We have not yet run into
828.82	our Lord Mansfield.
832.622	We shall. We shall.
834.23	This is a long-term strategic
834.23	litigation campaign. We shall.
838.11	And to quote Winston Churchill,
840.225	the way we view our cases
840.225	is that they're not the end,
844.393	they're not even the beginning of the end,
846.436	but they are perhaps
846.436	the end of the beginning.
850.58	Thank you.
852.497	(Applause)
