16.26	So, a funny thing happened
18.26	on my way to becoming a brilliant,
18.26	world-class neuropsychologist:
23.339	I had a baby.
25.265	And that's not to say
26.544	I ever went on to become a brilliant,
26.544	world-class neuropsychologist.
30.506	Sorry, TED.
32.975	But I did go on to be a reasonably astute,
36.658	arguably world-class worrier.
39.792	One of my girlfriends
39.792	in graduate school, Marie,
42.36	"said, ""Kim, I figured it out."
45.129	It's not that you're more neurotic
45.129	than everyone else;
47.96	it's just that you're more honest
47.96	"about how neurotic you are."""
51.481	So in the spirit of full disclosure,
54.519	I brought some pictures to share.
57.152	Awwww.
58.384	(Laughter)
59.409	I'll just say: July.
61.96	(Laughter)
66.96	Zip!
68.399	(Laughter)
69.424	For safety.
70.749	(Laughter)
72.436	Water wings --
74.352	an inch of water.
77.729	And then, finally, all suited up
79.747	for the 90-minute drive
79.747	to Copper Mountain.
82.539	So you can get kind of a feel for this.
86.515	So my baby, Vander,
86.515	is eight years old now.
89.983	And, despite being cursed
89.983	with my athletic inability,
94.624	he plays soccer.
96.221	He's interested in playing football.
98.222	He wants to learn how to ride a unicycle.
100.507	So why would I worry?
102.73	Because this is what I do.
102.73	This is what I teach.
105.731	It's what I study. It's what I treat.
107.827	And I know that kids
107.827	get concussed every year.
111.943	In fact, more than four million people
111.943	sustain a concussion every year,
115.365	and these data are just
115.365	among kids under 14
117.96	who were seen in emergency rooms.
120.246	And so when kids sustain a concussion,
122.96	we talk about them getting dinged
122.96	or getting their bell rung,
125.96	but what is it that
125.96	we're really talking about?
128.66	Let's take a look.
131.114	[Concussive Force]
134.313	"""Starsky and Hutch""? Arguably, yes."
137.882	So, a car accident.
139.166	Forty miles an hour into a fixed barrier:
146.628	A heavyweight boxer punches
146.628	you straight in the face:
152.795	(Music)
157.727	In case you missed it, we'll look again.
160.147	So look to the right-hand
160.147	side of the screen.
164.011	(Music)
168.657	What would you say?
170.864	How many Gs?
174.341	Close.
176.151	Seventy-two?
177.96	Would it be crazy to know:
182.888	The average concussive impact
184.654	is 95 Gs.
187.96	Now, when the kid
187.96	on the right doesn't get up,
191.327	we know they've had a concussion.
192.96	But how about the kid on the left,
194.609	or the athlete that leaves
194.609	the field of play?
197.127	How do we know if he or she
197.127	has sustained a concussion?
201.602	How do we know
202.955	that legislation that would require
202.955	they be pulled from play,
206.539	cleared for return to play,
208.642	applies to them?
210.745	The definition of concussion
212.311	doesn't actually require
212.311	a loss of consciousness.
214.968	It requires only a change
214.968	in consciousness,
217.745	and that can be any one
217.745	or a number of symptoms,
220.381	including feeling foggy, feeling dizzy,
223.563	hearing a ringing in your ear,
225.262	being more impulsive
225.262	or hostile than usual.
228.769	So given all of that and given
228.769	how darn neurotic I am,
232.071	how do I get any sleep at all?
234.652	Because I know our brains are resilient.
239.329	They're designed to recover
239.329	from an injury.
243.71	If -- God forbid --
245.96	any of us left here tonight
245.96	and sustained a concussion,
249.18	most of us would go on to fully recover
249.18	inside of a couple hours
252.68	to a couple of weeks.
254.15	But kids are more vulnerable
254.15	to brain injury.
256.495	In fact, high-school athletes
256.495	are three times more likely
259.804	to sustain catastrophic injuries
262.176	relative even to their college-age peers,
264.701	and it takes them longer
264.701	to return to a symptom-free baseline.
270.008	After that first injury,
272.262	their risk for second injury
272.262	is exponentially greater.
276.092	From there, their risk for a third injury,
276.092	greater still, and so on.
282.012	And here's the really alarming part:
285.403	We don't fully understand
285.403	the long-term impact of multiple injuries.
291.159	You guys may be familiar
291.159	with this research
293.307	that's coming out of the NFL.
295.75	In a nutshell,
295.75	this research suggests that,
298.491	among retired NFL players
298.491	with three or more career concussions,
303.758	the incidence of early-onset
303.758	dementing disease
306.758	is much greater than it
306.758	is for the general population.
310.086	So you've all seen that --
310.086	New York Times, you've seen it.
312.96	What you may not be familiar with
314.586	is that this research was spearheaded
314.586	by NFL wives who said,
319.729	"""Isn't it weird"
319.729	that my 46-year-old husband
322.73	"is forever losing his keys?"""
324.793	"""Isn't it weird that"
324.793	my 47-year-old husband
327.588	"is forever losing the car?"""
330.095	"""Isn't it weird that"
330.095	my 48-year-old husband
332.984	is forever losing his way home
335.029	"in the car, from the driveway?"""
338.298	I may have forgotten to mention
338.298	that my son is an only child.
344.12	So it's going to be really important
346.924	that he be able to drive
346.924	me around someday.
351.276	(Laughter)
352.45	So, how do we guarantee
352.45	the safety of our kids?
357.809	How can we 100 percent
357.809	guarantee the safety of our kids?
362.666	Let me tell you what I've come up with.
366.143	(Laughter)
370.96	If only.
372.292	My little boy's right there,
372.292	"and he's like, ""She's not kidding."
375.305	"She's totally not kidding."""
377.474	So in all seriousness:
380.066	Should my kid play football?
381.737	Should your kid play football?
383.548	I don't know.
384.738	But I do know there are
384.738	three things you can do.
388.269	The first: study up.
391.135	You have to be familiar with the issues
391.135	we're talking about today.
394.888	There are some great resources out there.
397.478	The CDC has a program, HEADS UP.
399.796	It's at CDC.gov.
401.454	HEADS UP is specific
401.454	to concussion in kids.
404.866	The second is a resource
404.866	I'm personally really proud of.
408.14	We've just rolled this out
408.14	in the last couple months --
410.806	CO Kids With Brain Injury.
412.499	This is a great resource
412.499	for student athletes,
415.175	teachers, parents, professionals,
415.175	athletic and coaching staff.
419.588	It's a great place to start
419.588	if you have questions.
424.143	The second thing is: speak up.
427.465	Just two weeks ago,
428.698	a bill introduced by Senator Kefalas
430.699	that would have required
430.699	athletes, kids under 18,
434.633	to wear a helmet
434.633	when they're riding their bike,
436.971	died in committee.
439.682	It died, in large part,
441.463	because it lacked constituent buy-in;
444.417	it lacked stakeholder traction.
446.92	Now, I'm not here to tell you
448.36	what kind of legislation
448.36	you should or shouldn't support,
451.285	but I am going to tell you
451.285	that, if it matters to you,
454.383	your legislators need to know that.
457.904	Speak up also with coaching staff.
459.751	Ask about what kind
459.751	of protective equipment is available.
462.752	What's the budget
462.752	for protective equipment?
464.825	How old it is?
466.399	Maybe offer to spearhead
466.399	a fundraiser to buy new gear.
470.129	Which brings us to: suit up.
473.15	Wear a helmet.
475.682	The only way to prevent a bad outcome
478.96	is to prevent that first injury
478.96	from happening.
482.96	Recently, one of my graduate
482.96	students, Tom, said,
487.543	"""Kim, I've decided to wear a bike helmet"
487.543	"on the way to class."""
491.944	And Tom knows that that little bit
491.944	of foam in a bike helmet
495.864	can reduce the g-force of impact by half.
499.918	Now, I thought it was because I have
499.918	this totally compelling helmet crusade,
504.903	this epiphany of Tom's.
507.046	As it turns out, it occurred
507.046	to Tom that a $20 helmet
510.737	is a good way to protect
510.737	a $100,000 graduate education.
514.96	(Laughter)
517.008	So ...
520.339	Should Vander play football?
523.371	I can't say no,
524.698	but I can guarantee that every time
524.698	he leaves the house,
528.96	that kid's wearing a helmet --
531.682	like, to the car,
533.683	or at school.
536.348	So whether athlete, scholar,
539.053	overprotected kid, neurotic mom,
541.752	or otherwise,
543.562	here's my baby, Vander,
545.474	reminding you
546.879	to mind your matter.
549.96	Thank you.
551.152	(Applause)
