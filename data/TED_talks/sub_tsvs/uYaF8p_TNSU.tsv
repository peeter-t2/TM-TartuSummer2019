12.76	I feel incredibly lucky
15.56	to be from a country
17.44	that's generally considered
17.44	to be the best place in the world
21.32	to be a woman.
24.72	In 1975, when I was seven years old,
28.48	women in Iceland went on a strike.
31.6	They did no work that day,
33.64	whether they held professional jobs
36.44	or had the work of the home.
39.16	They marched into
39.16	the center of Reykjavík --
44.4	and peacefully and in solidarity
48.2	asked for equality.
51.72	Nothing worked in Iceland that day,
54.8	because nothing works
54.8	when women are not at work.
57.76	(Applause)
65.8	Five years later,
65.8	Icelanders had the courage
69.36	to be the first country in the world
71.52	to democratically elect a woman
71.52	as their president.
75.96	I will never forget this day,
78.8	that President Vigdís,
78.8	as we know her by her first name,
83	stepped out on the balcony
83	of her own home,
86.4	a single mom with her daughter
86.4	by her side as she had won.
90.64	(Applause)
97.32	This woman was an incredible role model
99.72	for me and everyone
99.72	growing up at that time,
104.08	including boys.
105.84	She frequently shares the story
105.84	of how a young boy approached her
109.92	after a couple of terms in office
111.96	"and asked, ""Can boys"
111.96	"really grow up to be president?"""
115.88	(Laughter)
118.04	Role models really matter,
120.84	but even with such strong role models
123.68	who I am so grateful for,
126	when I was encouraged
126	to run for president,
128.88	my first reaction was,
128.88	"""Who am I to run for president?"
134.24	"Who am I to be president?"""
137.64	It turns out that women
140.039	are less likely
140.039	to consider running than men.
143.6	So a study done in the US in 2011
147	showed that 62 percent of men
147	had considered running for office,
153.36	but 45 percent of women.
156.12	That's gap of 16 percentage points,
159.52	and it's the same gap
159.52	that existed a decade earlier.
164	And it really is a shame,
166.32	because I am so convinced that the world
166.32	is in real need for women leaders
171.36	and more principle-based leadership
173.44	in general.
176.08	So my decision to run
179.68	ultimately came down to the fact
183.16	that I felt
185.36	that I had to do my bit,
189.64	even if I had no political experience,
192.92	to step up and try to be part
192.92	of creating the world
197.56	that will make sense and be sustainable
200.4	for our kids,
201.96	and a world where we truly allow
201.96	both our boys and girls
207.36	to be all they can be.
211.08	And it was the journey of my life.
216.28	It was amazing.
219.04	The journey started with potentially
219.04	as many as 20 candidates.
223.6	It boiled down to
223.6	nine candidates qualifying,
227.04	and ultimately the race
227.04	came down to four of us,
231.12	three men and me.
233.04	(Applause)
239.76	But that's not all the drama yet.
242.48	You may think you have drama in the US,
244.76	but I can --
246	(Laughter)
248.28	I can assure you
248.28	we had our own drama in Iceland.
252.08	So our sitting president of 20 years
255.04	announced initially
255.04	that he was not going to run,
257.72	which is probably what gave rise
259.32	to so many candidates considering running.
262.88	Then later he changed his mind
265.12	when our prime minister resigned
268.68	following the infamous Panama Papers
271.959	that implicated him and his family.
274.88	And there was a popular
274.88	protest in Iceland,
276.96	so the sitting president thought
276.96	they needed a trusted leader.
283.04	A few days later, relations
283.04	to his wife and her family's companies
287.04	were also discovered in the Panama Papers,
290	and so he withdrew from the race again.
293.68	Before doing so, he said he was doing that
296.32	because now there were two qualified men
300.28	who he felt could fill his shoes
300.28	running for office.
305.04	So on May 9, 45 days before election day,
311.48	it was not looking too good for me.
314.72	I did not even make the graph
314.72	in the newspaper.
318.08	The polls had me at 1 percent,
321.08	but that was still the highest
322.56	that any woman announcing
322.56	her candidacy had earned.
327.44	So it would be an understatement
327.44	to say that I had to work extremely hard
332.2	to get my seat at the table
334.52	and access to television,
337	because the network decided
337	that they would only include
340.44	those with 2.5 percent
340.44	or more in the polls
343.88	in the first TV debate.
346.68	I found out on the afternoon
346.68	of the first TV debate
350.08	that I would participate
350.08	along with the three men,
353.84	and I found out on live TV
356.28	that I came in at exactly 2.5 percent
356.28	on the day of the first TV debate.
361.64	(Applause)
367	So, challenges.
370.52	The foremost challenges I had to face
370.52	and overcome on this journey
374	had to do with media, muscle and money.
376.92	Let's start with media.
378.76	There are those who say
378.76	gender doesn't matter
381.16	when it comes to media and politics.
382.92	I can't say that I agree.
385.44	It proved harder for me
385.44	to both get access and airtime in media.
389.8	As a matter of fact, the leading candidate
389.8	appeared in broadcast media
	leading up to the elections,
396.28	whereas I appeared 31 times.
399.72	And I am not saying
399.72	media is doing this consciously.
403.88	I think largely this has to do
403.88	with unconscious bias,
406.8	because in media,
406.8	much like everywhere else,
410.28	we have both conscious
410.28	and unconscious bias,
414.12	and we need to have the courage
414.12	to talk about it if we want to change it.
418.6	When I finally got access to TV,
420.76	the first question I got was,
420.76	"""Are you going to quit?"""
425.72	And that was a hard one.
428.36	But of course, with 1 percent
428.36	to 2.5 percent in the polls,
431.24	maybe it's understandable.
433.16	But media really matters,
433.16	and every time I appeared on TV,
436.88	we saw and experienced
436.88	a rise in the polls,
440.12	so I know firsthand how much this matters
442.76	and why we have to talk about it.
445.08	I was the only one
445.08	out of the final four candidates
447.52	that never got a front page interview.
449.84	I was sometimes left out of the questions
449.84	asked of all other candidates
453.96	and out of coverage about the elections.
456.64	So I did face this,
458	but I will say this
458	to compliment the Icelandic media.
461.48	I got few if any comments
461.48	about my hair and pantsuit.
466.2	(Applause)
468.8	So kudos to them.
471.64	But there is another experience
471.64	that's very important.
476.12	I ran as an independent candidate,
478.4	not with any political party
478.4	or muscle behind me.
481.72	That lack of experience
484.08	and lack of access to resources
486.36	probably came at a cost to our campaign,
489.4	but it also allowed us to innovate
489.4	and do politics differently.
494.04	We ran a positive campaign,
497.88	and we probably changed the tone
497.88	of the election for others by doing that.
503.48	It may be the reason
503.48	why I had less airtime on TV,
506.2	because I wanted to show
506.2	other contenders respect.
510.64	When access to media
510.64	proved to be so difficult,
513.64	we ran our own media.
515.72	I ran live Facebook sessions
517.6	where I took questions from voters
517.6	on anything and responded on the spot.
523.56	And we put all the questions I got
523.56	and all the answers on an open Facebook
527.88	because we thought
527.88	transparency is important
530.96	if you want to establish trust.
533.12	And when reaching young voters
533.12	proved to be challenging,
536.28	I became a Snapchatter.
539.08	I got young people
539.08	to teach me how to do that,
541.56	and I used every filter on Snapchat
541.56	during the last part of the campaign.
546.84	And I actually had to use a lot of humor
546.84	and humility, as I was very bad at it.
552.08	But we grew the following
552.08	amongst young people by doing that.
556.12	So it's possible to run
556.12	a different type of campaign.
559.32	But unfortunately, one cannot talk
559.32	about politics without mentioning money.
565.6	I am sad that it is that way,
565.6	but it's true,
567.84	and we had less financial resources
567.84	than the other candidates.
572.76	This probably was partly due to the fact
576.92	that I think I had a harder time
576.92	asking for financial support.
581.04	And maybe I also had the ambition
581.04	to do more with less.
586.44	Some would call that very womanly of me.
590.6	But even with one third the media,
590.6	one third the financial resources,
596.24	and only an entrepreneurial team,
596.24	but an amazing team,
599.8	we managed to surprise everyone
599.8	on election night,
604	when the first numbers came in.
606.68	I surprised myself,
606.68	as you may see in that photo.
609.32	(Laughter)
611.6	So the first numbers,
614.16	I came in neck to neck
614.16	to the leading candidate.
616.84	(Cheers)
624.52	Well, too early,
624.52	because I didn't quite pull that,
627.68	but I came in second,
629.2	and we went a long way
629.2	from the one percent,
632.4	with nearly a third of the vote,
634.4	and we beat the polls
634.4	by an unprecedented margin,
637.44	or 10 percentage points
637.44	above what the last poll came in at.
642.36	Some people call me the real winner
642.36	of the election because of this,
645.68	and there are many people
645.68	who encouraged me to run again.
649.52	But what really makes me proud
652.12	is to know that I earned
653.8	proportionately higher percentage
653.8	support from the young people,
658.52	and a lot of people encouraged
658.52	my daughter to run in 2040.
663.68	(Applause)
670.4	She is 13,
672.96	and she had never been on TV before.
675.4	And on election day,
675.4	I observed her on TV repeatedly,
679.68	and she was smart, she was self-confident,
683.04	she was sincere, and she was
683.04	supportive of her mother.
686.44	This was probably
686.44	the highlight of my campaign.
689.64	(Applause)
696.6	But there was another one.
698.44	These are preschool girls out on a walk,
701	and they found
701	a poster of me on a bus stop,
703.2	and they saw the need to kiss it.
705.44	Audience: Aw!
707.16	This picture was really
707.16	enough of a win for me.
711.28	What we see, we can be.
714.48	So screw fear and challenges.
717.36	(Applause)
719.76	It matters that women run,
722.04	and it's time for women to run for office,
726	be it the office of the CEO
726	or the office of the president.
731.28	I also managed to put an impression
731.28	"on your very own ""New Yorker."""
736.6	I earned a new title,
736.6	"""A living emoji of sincerity."""
740.72	(Cheers)
744.68	It is possibly my proudest title yet,
749.56	and the reason is
749.56	that women too often get penalized
753.6	for using what I call
753.6	their emotional capital,
757.2	but I know from experience
757.2	that we become so good
761.12	when we do just that.
762.84	(Applause)
767.72	And we need more of that.
771.2	We celebrated as if we had won
771.2	on election night,
774.72	because that's how we felt.
776.52	So you don't necessarily
776.52	have to reach that office.
780.88	You just have to go for it,
782.64	and you, your family, your friends,
782.64	everyone working with you,
785.72	if you do it well, you will grow beyond
785.72	anything you will experience before.
792	So we had a good time,
794.44	and I learned a lot on this journey,
797.12	probably more lessons
797.12	than I can share here
799.88	in the time we have today.
801.68	But rest assured, it was hard work.
805.2	I lost a lot of sleep during those months.
808.8	It took resilience
808.8	and perseverance to not quit,
814.4	but I learned something
814.4	that I knew before on the one percent day,
818.68	and that is that you can only be good
821.72	when you are truly, authentically
821.72	listening to your own voice
825.64	and working in alignment with that.
829.08	As a good sister of mine sometimes says,
831.72	you may cheat on your intuition,
834.32	but your intuition never cheats on you.
839.64	I think it's also very important,
839.64	and you all know this,
842.84	that on any journey you go on,
844.44	it's the team you take along.
846.56	It's having people around you
846.56	who share your values, your vision,
851.4	but are different in every other way.
854.04	That's the formula for success for me,
856.44	and I am blessed with an amazing husband,
858.92	here today,
861.08	an incredible family --
862.84	(Applause)
864.8	and great friends,
866.04	and we came together
866.04	as entrepreneurs in the political arena,
869.44	and pulled something off
869.44	that everyone said would be impossible.
873.28	As a matter of fact,
873.28	the leading PR expert told me
876.48	before I made my decision
878.24	that I would do well to get seven percent.
881.64	I appreciated his perspective,
881.64	because he was probably right,
885.88	and he was basing it
885.88	on valuable experience.
888.08	But on the one percent day,
889.44	I decided here to show him
889.44	that he was wrong.
894.32	It's very important to mention this,
894.32	because I did lose a lot of sleep,
897.72	and I worked hard,
897.72	and so did the people with me.
900.44	We can never go the distance
900.44	if we forget to take care of ourselves.
904.56	And it's two things that I think
904.56	are very important in that,
907.44	in surrounding yourself with people
907.44	and practices that nourish you,
911	but it's equally important,
911	maybe even more important,
913.8	to have the courage
913.8	to get rid of people and practices
917.56	that take away your energy,
919.64	including the wonderful bloggers
919.64	and commentators.
924.2	I took a lot of support
924.2	from others in doing this,
927.2	and I made the decision to go high
927.2	when others went low,
931.28	and that's partly how I kept
931.28	my energy going throughout all of this.
936.16	And when I lost my energy for a moment --
938.36	and I did from time to time,
938.36	it wasn't easy --
941.68	I went back to why I decided to run,
945	and how I had decided to run my own race.
949.52	I called it a 4G campaign,
952.12	the G's representing the Icelandic words.
954.92	"And the first one is called ""Gagn."""
957.08	I ran to do good,
959.36	to be of service,
960.6	and I wanted servant leadership
963.12	to be at the center of how I worked
963.12	and everybody else in the campaign.
967.52	"Second one is ""Gleði,"" or joy."
970.24	I decided to enjoy the journey.
972.36	There was a lot to be taken
972.36	out of the journey,
974.6	no matter if the destination
974.6	was reached or not.
977.24	And I tried my utmost
977.24	to inspire others to do so as well.
981.2	"Third is ""Gagnsæi."""
983	I was open to any questions.
984.76	I kept no secrets,
986.32	and it was all open,
986.32	on Facebook and websites.
989.44	Because I think if you're
989.44	choosing your president,
991.84	you deserve answers to your questions.
994.84	Last but not least,
997.16	I don't need to explain that in this room,
999.56	we ran on the principle of Girlpower.
1002.48	(Cheers)
1008.08	I am incredibly glad
1010.2	that I had the courage to run,
1012.44	to risk failure but receive success
1015.52	on so many levels.
1018.56	I can't tell you that it was easy,
1021.96	but I can tell you,
1024.08	and I think my entire team
1024.08	will agree with me,
1027.76	that it was worth it.
1030.6	Thank you.
1031.84	(Applause)
1033.56	Thank you.
1036.76	Thank you.
1038	(Applause)
1046.92	Pat Mitchell: I'm not letting you go yet.
1049.88	Halla Tómasdóttir: What a great crowd.
1053.839	PM: I can't let you go
1053.839	without saying
1055.96	that probably everybody in the room
1055.96	is ready to move to Iceland
1058.96	and vote for you.
1060.68	But of course we probably
1060.68	can't vote there,
1062.76	but one thing we can get from Iceland
1065.16	and have always gotten is inspiration.
1068	I mean, I'm old enough to remember 1975
1071.2	when all the Icelandic women walked out,
1073.24	and that really was a very big factor
1073.24	in launching the women's movement.
1076.84	You made a reference to it earlier.
1076.84	I'd love to bring the picture back up
1080.32	and just have us remember what it was like
1080.32	when a country came to a standstill.
1084.56	And then what you may not know
1086.92	because our American media
1086.92	did not report it,
1090.96	the Icelandic women
1090.96	walked out again on Monday. Right?
1094.88	HT: Yes, they did.
1094.88	PM: Can you tell us about that?
1097.571	HT: Yes, so 41 years
1097.571	after the original strike,
1100.4	we may be the best place
1100.4	in the world to be a woman,
1103.68	but our work isn't done.
1106.04	So at 2:38pm on Monday,
1108.68	women in Iceland left work,
1110.4	because that's when
1110.4	they had earned their day's salary.
1113.32	(Applause)
1128.08	What's really cool about this
1130.48	is that young women and men participated
1134.2	in greater numbers than before,
1136.4	because it is time
1136.4	that we close the pay gap.
1142.72	PM: So I'm not going to ask
1142.72	Halla to commit right now
1145.6	to what she's doing next,
1146.88	but I will say that you'd have
1146.88	a very large volunteer army
1150.28	should you decide to do that again.
1152.72	Thank you Halla.
1154	HT: Thank you all.
1155.44	(Applause)
