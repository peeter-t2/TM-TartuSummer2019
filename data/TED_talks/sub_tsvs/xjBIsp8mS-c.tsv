13.961	There is nothing bigger
13.961	or older than the universe.
19.66	The questions
19.66	I would like to talk about are:
25.509	one, where did we come from?
29.977	How did the universe come into being?
34.167	Are we alone in the universe?
37.153	Is there alien life out there?
40.296	What is the future of the human race?
43.606	Up until the 1920s,
46.16	everyone thought the universe
46.16	was essentially static
49.16	and unchanging in time.
52.222	Then it was discovered
52.222	that the universe was expanding.
56.841	Distant galaxies were moving away from us.
61.664	This meant they must have been
61.664	closer together in the past.
66.413	If we extrapolate back,
68.54	we find we must have
68.54	all been on top of each other
72.16	about 15 billion years ago.
75.856	This was the Big Bang,
75.856	the beginning of the universe.
80.666	But was there anything
80.666	before the Big Bang?
84.643	If not, what created the universe?
88.483	Why did the universe emerge
88.483	from the Big Bang the way it did?
94.35	We used to think
94.35	that the theory of the universe
97.16	could be divided into two parts.
100.67	First, there were the laws
102.16	like Maxwell's equations
102.16	and general relativity
105.848	that determined the evolution
105.848	of the universe,
108.837	given its state
108.837	over all of space at one time.
113.468	And second, there was no question
113.468	of the initial state of the universe.
119.911	We have made good progress
119.911	on the first part,
123.16	and now have the knowledge
123.16	of the laws of evolution
126.16	in all but the most extreme conditions.
129.16	But until recently,
129.16	we have had little idea
132.16	about the initial conditions
132.16	for the universe.
136.397	However, this division into laws
136.397	of evolution and initial conditions
141.85	depends on time and space
141.85	being separate and distinct.
146.834	Under extreme conditions,
146.834	general relativity and quantum theory
151.659	allow time to behave
151.659	like another dimension of space.
159.772	This removes the distinction
159.772	between time and space,
163.383	and means the laws of evolution
163.383	can also determine the initial state.
171.57	The universe can spontaneously
171.57	create itself out of nothing.
178.757	Moreover, we can calculate
178.757	a probability that the universe
183.16	was created in different states.
186.593	These predictions
186.593	are in excellent agreement
188.946	with observations by the WMAP satellite
188.946	of the cosmic microwave background,
195.142	which is an imprint
195.142	of the very early universe.
200.05	We think we have solved
200.05	the mystery of creation.
204.396	Maybe we should patent the universe
206.952	and charge everyone royalties
206.952	for their existence.
213.562	I now turn to the second big question:
216.538	are we alone, or is there
216.538	other life in the universe?
224.16	We believe that life arose
224.16	spontaneously on the Earth,
227.849	so it must be possible for life
227.849	to appear on other suitable planets,
232.723	of which there seem to be
232.723	a large number in the galaxy.
238.888	But we don't know how life first appeared.
244.264	We have two pieces
244.264	of observational evidence
247.16	on the probability of life appearing.
252.062	The first is that we have fossils of algae
252.062	from 3.5 billion years ago.
259.16	The Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago
263.34	and was probably too hot
263.34	for about the first half billion years.
273.59	So life appeared on Earth
275.439	within half a billion years
275.439	of it being possible,
279.115	which is short compared
279.115	to the 10-billion-year lifetime
282.815	of a planet of Earth type.
285.584	This suggests that the probability
285.584	of life appearing is reasonably high.
291.426	If it was very low,
291.426	one would have expected it
294.678	to take most
294.678	of the ten billion years available.
299.17	On the other hand, we don't seem
299.17	to have been visited by aliens.
304.858	I am discounting the reports of UFOs.
308.818	Why would they appear
308.818	only to cranks and weirdos?
314.637	If there is a government conspiracy
314.637	to suppress the reports
318.726	and keep for itself the scientific
318.726	knowledge the aliens bring,
323.16	it seems to have been a singularly
323.16	ineffective policy so far.
332.446	Furthermore, despite an extensive search
332.446	by the SETI project,
337.16	we haven't heard any alien
337.16	television quiz shows.
342.294	This probably indicates
342.294	that there are no alien civilizations
346.605	at our stage of development
348.875	within a radius
348.875	of a few hundred light years.
353.16	Issuing an insurance policy
355.16	against abduction by aliens
355.16	seems a pretty safe bet.
362.269	This brings me to the last
362.269	of the big questions:
365.579	the future of the human race.
368.821	If we are the only intelligent
368.821	beings in the galaxy,
372.504	we should make sure
372.504	we survive and continue.
379	But we are entering an increasingly
379	dangerous period of our history.
388.124	Our population and our use
388.124	of the finite resources of planet Earth
392.982	are growing exponentially,
395.078	along with our technical ability
395.078	to change the environment for good or ill.
404.869	But our genetic code
406.639	still carries the selfish
406.639	and aggressive instincts
409.67	that were of survival
409.67	advantage in the past.
417.091	It will be difficult enough
417.091	to avoid disaster
420.136	in the next hundred years,
421.876	let alone the next thousand or million.
428.667	Our only chance of long-term survival
431.802	is not to remain inward-looking
431.802	on planet Earth,
435.16	but to spread out into space.
440.16	The answers to these big questions
442.604	show that we have made remarkable progress
442.604	in the last hundred years.
448.456	But if we want to continue
448.456	beyond the next hundred years,
452.503	our future is in space.
456.723	That is why I am in favor of manned --
459.16	or should I say, 
459.16	personned -- space flight.
468.066	All of my life I have sought
468.066	to understand the universe
472.16	and find answers to these questions.
475.665	I have been very lucky
477.522	that my disability has not been
477.522	a serious handicap.
481.603	Indeed, it has probably given me
481.603	more time than most people
486.266	to pursue the quest for knowledge.
492.166	The ultimate goal is a complete
492.166	theory of the universe,
496.16	and we are making good progress.
502.319	Thank you for listening.
506.62	Chris Anderson: Professor,
506.62	if you had to guess either way,
509.998	do you now believe
509.998	that it is more likely than not
513.828	that we are alone in the Milky Way,
517.17	as a civilization of our level
517.17	of intelligence or higher?
537.16	This answer took seven minutes,
537.16	and really gave me an insight
543.16	into the incredible act of generosity
543.16	this whole talk was for TED.
558.643	Stephen Hawking: I think it quite likely
558.643	that we are the only civilization
563.16	within several hundred light years;
566.519	otherwise we would have heard radio waves.
572.632	The alternative is that civilizations
572.632	don't last very long,
577.136	but destroy themselves.
580.83	CA: Professor Hawking,
580.83	thank you for that answer.
584.16	We will take it
584.16	as a salutary warning, I think,
587.133	for the rest of our conference this week.
590.261	Professor, we really thank you
590.261	for the extraordinary effort you made
594.451	to share your questions with us today.
597.388	Thank you very much indeed.
599.064	(Applause)
