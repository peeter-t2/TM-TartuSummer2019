13.531	I will always remember
15.776	the first time I met the girl
15.776	in the blue uniform.
21.577	I was eight at the time,
24.189	living in the village with my grandmother,
27.546	who was raising me and other children.
31.538	Famine had hit my country of Zimbabwe,
36.236	and we just didn't have enough to eat.
40.403	We were hungry.
43.586	And that's when the girl
43.586	in the blue uniform
47.101	came to my village with the United Nations
50.681	to feed the children.
53.784	As she handed me my porridge,
56.387	I asked her why she was there,
59.672	and without hesitation, she said,
63.386	"""As Africans, we must uplift"
63.386	"all the people of Africa."""
71.705	I had absolutely no idea what she meant.
74.761	(Laughter)
76.856	But her words stuck with me.
80.419	Two years later,
81.999	famine hit my country for the second time.
86.514	My grandmother had no choice
86.514	but to send me to the city
90.999	to live with an aunt
90.999	I had never met before.
95.149	So at the age of 10,
97.031	I found myself in school
97.031	for the very first time.
102.816	And there, at the city school,
105.483	I would experience
105.483	what it was to be unequal.
110.999	You see, in the village,
112.801	we were all equal.
115.094	But in the eyes and the minds
115.094	of the other kids,
118.285	I was not their equal.
121.165	I couldn't speak English,
123.522	and I was way behind
123.522	in terms of reading and writing.
129.197	But this feeling of inequality
129.197	would get even more complex.
134.999	Every school holiday
136.785	spent back in the village
136.785	with my grandmother
139.944	made me consciously aware
142.436	of the inequalities
142.436	this incredible opportunity
145.999	had created within my own family.
150.086	Suddenly, I had much more
150.086	than the rest of my village.
155.737	And in their eyes,
155.737	I was no longer their equal.
161.213	I felt guilty.
164.53	But I thought about the girl
164.53	in the blue uniform,
168.061	and I remember thinking,
170.348	"""That's who I want to be --"
173.181	someone like her,
175.274	"someone who uplifts other people."""
179.903	This childhood experience
179.903	led me to the United Nations,
184.999	and to my current role with UN Women,
187.65	where we are addressing
187.65	one of the greatest inequalities
191.817	that affects more than half
191.817	of the world's population --
195.786	women and girls.
198.641	Today, I want to share with you
200.506	a simple idea that seeks to uplift
200.506	all of us together.
209.157	Eight months ago,
210.895	under the visionary leadership
210.895	of Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka,
215.164	head of UN Women,
217.244	we launched a groundbreaking initiative
220.269	called HeForShe,
222.117	inviting men and boys
222.117	from around the world
225.53	to stand in solidarity
225.53	with each other and with women,
229.872	to create a shared vision
229.872	for gender equality.
234.054	This is an invitation
234.054	for those who believe in equality
238.999	for women and men,
241.284	and those who don't yet know
241.284	that they believe.
245.935	The initiative is based on a simple idea:
249.999	that what we share is much more powerful
254.404	than what divides us.
256.705	We all feel the same things.
259.325	We all want the same things,
262.34	even when those things
262.34	sometimes remain unspoken.
268.356	HeForShe is about uplifting all of us,
271.102	women and men together.
273.403	It's moving us towards
273.403	an inflection point for gender equality.
278.999	Imagine a blank page
281.174	with one horizontal line
281.174	splitting it in half.
285.229	Now imagine that women
285.229	are represented here,
289.427	and men are represented here.
293.165	In our current population,
295.299	HeForShe is about moving
295.299	the 3.2 billion men,
300.711	one man at a time,
302.824	across that line,
304.649	so that ultimately,
304.649	men can stand alongside women
309.999	and be on the right side of history,
312.864	making gender equality a reality
312.864	in the 21st century.
319.348	However, engaging men in the movement
319.348	would prove quite controversial.
324.999	Why invite men? They are the problem.
327.872	(Laughter)
329.054	In fact, men don't care, we were told.
333.387	But something incredible happened
333.387	when we launched HeForShe.
338.34	In just three days, more than 100,000 men
343.491	had signed up and committed
343.491	to be agents of change for equality.
349.999	Within that first week, at least one man
349.999	in every single country in the world
356.451	stood up to be counted,
359.268	and within that same week,
361.641	HeForShe created more than
361.641	1.2 billion conversations on social media.
369.308	And that's when the emails
369.308	started pouring in,
373.633	sometimes as many as a thousand a day.
379.435	We heard from a man out of Zimbabwe,
382.514	who, after hearing about HeForShe,
385.205	"created a ""husband school."""
387.443	(Laughter)
389.76	He literally went around his village,
392.736	hand-picking all of the men
392.736	that were abusive to their partners,
397.022	and committed to turn them
397.022	into better husbands and fathers.
402.625	In Pune, India, a youth advocate
402.625	organized an innovative bicycle rally,
408.713	mobilizing 700 cyclists
412.372	to share the HeForShe messages
412.372	within their own community.
417.705	In another impact story,
420.514	a man sent a very personal note
422.943	of something that had happened
422.943	in his own community.
426.752	He wrote,
429.419	"""Dear Madam,"
431.331	I have lived all of my life
433.991	next door to a man
433.991	who continuously beats up his wife.
439.506	Two weeks ago,
441.069	I was listening to my radio,
443.8	and your voice came on,
446.236	and you spoke about something
446.236	called the HeForShe,
450.78	and the need for men to play their role.
455.023	Within a few hours, I heard
455.023	the woman cry again next door,
460.729	but for the first time,
463.173	I didn't just sit there.
465.19	I felt compelled to do something,
468.999	so I went over
468.999	and I confronted the husband.
473.694	Madam, it has been two weeks,
477.084	and the woman has not cried since.
479.909	"Thank you for giving me a voice."""
482.959	(Applause)
488.166	Personal impact stories such as these
491.999	show that we are tapping
491.999	into something within men,
496.364	but getting to a world
496.364	where women and men are equal
499.999	is not just a matter
499.999	of bringing men to the cause.
504.332	We want concrete, systematic,
504.332	structural change that can equalize
511.34	the political, economic
511.34	and social realities for women and men.
517.514	We are asking men
517.514	to make concrete actions,
520.593	calling them to intervene
520.593	at a personal level,
523.737	to change their behavior.
526.165	We are calling upon governments,
526.165	businesses, universities,
531.189	to change their policies.
534.237	We want male leaders to become role models
538.443	and change agents
538.443	within their own institutions.
543.26	Already, a number of prominent men
543.26	and leaders have stepped up
547.721	and made some concrete
547.721	HeForShe commitments.
551.292	In a few early success stories,
554.799	a leading French
554.799	hospitality company, Accor,
558.363	has committed to eliminate the pay gap
562.063	for all of its 180,000 employees by 2020.
567.459	(Applause)
571.031	The government of Sweden,
573.491	under its current feminist government,
576.174	has committed to close
576.174	both the employment and the pay gap
581.357	for all of its citizens
581.357	within the current electoral term.
586.999	In Japan, the University of Nagoya
590.125	is building, as part of
590.125	their HeForShe commitments,
593.404	what will become one of Japan's
593.404	leading gender-research centers.
600.665	Now, eight months later,
603.196	a movement is building.
606.03	We are seeing men sign up
606.03	from every single walk of life,
610.999	and from every single corner in the world,
614.373	from the United Nations' own
614.373	Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
618.579	to the Secretary-Generals of NATO
618.579	and the EU Council,
624.221	from the prime minister of Bhutan
626.822	to the president of Sierra Leone.
630.068	In Europe alone,
630.068	all the male EU Commissioners
634.21	and the members of Parliament
634.21	of the Swedish and Iceland governments
638.33	have signed up to be HeForShe.
641.464	In fact, one in 20 men in Iceland
641.464	has joined the movement.
648.681	The rallying call of our passionate
648.681	goodwill ambassador, Emma Watson,
653.237	has garnered more than
653.237	five billion media impressions,
657.19	mobilizing hundreds and thousands
657.19	of students around the world
662.215	to create more than a hundred
662.215	HeForShe student associations.
668.118	Now this is the beginning
668.118	of the vision that HeForShe has
673.341	for the world that we want to see.
677.079	Einstein once said,
679.865	"""A human being is part of the whole ..."
684.523	but he experiences himself,
687.262	his thoughts and feelings,
689.357	as something separate from the rest ...
692.725	This delusion
692.725	is a kind of prison for us ...
696.856	Our task must be
696.856	to free ourselves from this prison
701.84	"by widening our circle of compassion."""
706.982	If women and men
706.982	are part of a greater whole,
710.475	as Einstein suggests,
712.999	it is my hope that HeForShe
712.999	can help free us to realize
718.276	that it is not our gender that defines us,
722.951	but ultimately, our shared humanity.
727.015	HeForShe is tapping
727.015	into women's and men's dreams,
731.532	the dreams that we have for ourselves,
734.57	and the dreams that we have
734.57	for our families, our children,
739.499	friends, communities.
743.078	So that's what it is about.
746.776	HeForShe is about uplifting
746.776	all of us together.
754.086	Thank you.
755.269	(Applause)
