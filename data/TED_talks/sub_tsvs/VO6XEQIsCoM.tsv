25	I'm going to talk to you about some stuff
25	that's in this book of mine
28.31	that I hope will resonate with other
28.31	things you've already heard,
31.431	and I'll try to make
31.431	some connections myself,
33.756	in case you missed them.
35.1	But I want to start with
35.1	"what I call the ""official dogma."""
39.936	The official dogma of what?
41.412	The official dogma of all Western
41.412	industrial societies.
44.742	And the official dogma runs like this:
47.079	if we are interested in maximizing
47.079	the welfare of our citizens,
51.801	the way to do that
51.801	is to maximize individual freedom.
57.892	The reason for this is both that freedom
57.892	is in and of itself good,
62	valuable, worthwhile,
62	essential to being human.
65.519	And because if people have freedom,
68	then each of us can act on our own
70	to do the things
70	that will maximize our welfare,
72.31	and no one has to decide on our behalf.
75.698	The way to maximize freedom
75.698	is to maximize choice.
80.738	The more choice people have,
80.738	the more freedom they have,
84.452	and the more freedom they have,
86.159	the more welfare they have.
89	This, I think, is so deeply embedded
89	in the water supply
94	that it wouldn't occur
94	to anyone to question it.
98.295	And it's also deeply
98.295	embedded in our lives.
102.648	I'll give you some examples
104.336	of what modern progress
104.336	has made possible for us.
108	This is my supermarket.
109.83	Not such a big one.
111.84	I want to say just a word
111.84	about salad dressing.
117	if you don't count the 10
117	extra-virgin olive oils
120	and 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy
123	to make a very large number
123	of your own salad dressings,
126	in the off-chance that none of the 175
126	the store has on offer suit you.
131.476	So this is what the supermarket is like.
133.437	And then you go
133.437	to the consumer electronics store
135.889	to set up a stereo system --
137.508	speakers, CD player,
137.508	tape player, tuner, amplifier --
141	and in this one single
141	consumer electronics store,
145	there are that many stereo systems.
148.92	We can construct six-and-a-half-million
148.92	different stereo systems
153.921	out of the components
153.921	that are on offer in one store.
156.603	You've got to admit
156.603	that's a lot of choice.
159.294	In other domains --
159.294	the world of communications.
163.389	There was a time, when I was a boy,
165.255	when you could get any kind
165.255	of telephone service you wanted,
168.096	as long as it came from Ma Bell.
169.938	You rented your phone. You didn't buy it.
172	One consequence of that, by the way,
172	is that the phone never broke.
175.215	And those days are gone.
178	We now have an almost
178	unlimited variety of phones,
181	especially in the world of cell phones.
183	These are cell phones of the future.
186	My favorite is the middle one --
188	the MP3 player, nose hair trimmer,
188	and crème brûlée torch.
192.209	(Laughter)
194.72	And if by some chance you haven't
194.72	seen that in your store yet,
198	you can rest assured
198	that one day soon, you will.
200.91	And what this does
202.111	is it leads people to walk
202.111	into their stores asking this question.
205.785	And do you know what the answer
205.785	to this question now is?
208.477	"The answer is ""no."""
210.516	It is not possible to buy a cell phone
210.516	that doesn't do too much.
214.578	So, in other aspects of life that are much
214.578	more significant than buying things,
219	the same explosion of choice is true.
222.517	Health care.
224.047	It is no longer the case
224.047	in the United States
226.604	that you go to the doctor,
226.604	and the doctor tells you what to do.
230.48	Instead, you go to the doctor,
232.163	and the doctor tells you,
232.163	"""Well, we could do A, or we could do B."
235.337	A has these benefits, and these risks.
237.743	B has these benefits, and these risks.
240.375	"What do you want to do?"""
242.138	"And you say, ""Doc, what should I do?"""
245	"And the doc says, ""A has"
245	these benefits and risks,
247.78	and B has these benefits and risks.
249.762	"What do you want to do?"""
251.777	"And you say, ""If you were me,"
251.777	"Doc, what would you do?"""
255.793	"And the doc says, ""But I'm not you."""
259	And the result is --
259	"we call it ""patient autonomy,"""
261.842	which makes it sound like a good thing,
263.739	but it really is a shifting
263.739	of the burden and the responsibility
266.826	for decision-making from somebody
266.826	who knows something --
269.499	namely, the doctor --
270.537	to somebody who knows nothing
270.537	and is almost certainly sick
273.293	and thus not in the best shape
273.293	to be making decisions --
276	namely, the patient.
277.896	There's enormous marketing
277.896	of prescription drugs
280.746	to people like you and me,
282.021	which, if you think about it,
282.021	makes no sense at all,
284.501	since we can't buy them.
285.738	Why do they market to us
285.738	if we can't buy them?
288.215	The answer is that they expect us
288.215	to call our doctors the next morning
292	and ask for our prescriptions
292	to be changed.
295.532	Something as dramatic as our identity
299.533	has now become a matter of choice,
302.317	as this slide is meant to indicate.
305.794	We don't inherit an identity;
305.794	we get to invent it.
308.646	And we get to re-invent
308.646	ourselves as often as we like.
312	And that means that every day,
312	when you wake up in the morning,
314.977	you have to decide what kind
314.977	of person you want to be.
318.721	With respect to marriage and family,
322.444	there was a time when the default
322.444	assumption that almost everyone had
327.289	is that you got married
327.289	as soon as you could,
329.415	and then you started having kids
329.415	as soon as you could.
332.049	The only real choice was who,
334.928	not when, and not what you did after.
338.112	Nowadays, everything
338.112	is very much up for grabs.
341	I teach wonderfully intelligent students,
343.745	and I assign 20 percent
343.745	less work than I used to.
347.543	And it's not because they're less smart,
350	and it's not because
350	they're less diligent.
352.417	It's because they are preoccupied,
352.417	asking themselves,
355.894	"""Should I get married or not?"
355.894	Should I get married now?
358.53	Should I get married later?
359.847	Should I have kids first,
359.847	"or a career first?"""
362.258	All of these are consuming questions.
365	And they're going to answer
365	these questions,
367.12	whether or not it means
367.12	not doing all the work I assign
369.765	and not getting a good grade
369.765	in my courses.
371.843	And indeed they should.
373.001	These are important questions to answer.
376.887	Work --
378.074	we are blessed, as Carl was pointing out,
380.393	with the technology that enables us
382.394	to work every minute of every day
382.394	from any place on the planet --
388.46	except the Randolph Hotel.
390.777	(Laughter)
393.841	(Applause)
395.634	There is one corner, by the way,
398	that I'm not going to tell anybody about,
398	where the WiFi actually works.
402.63	I'm not telling you about it
402.63	because I want to use it.
405.439	So what this means,
406.708	this incredible freedom of choice
406.708	we have with respect to work,
409.771	is that we have to make a decision,
411.468	again and again and again,
413.58	about whether we should
413.58	or shouldn't be working.
416	We can go to watch our kid play soccer,
418.629	and we have our cell phone on one hip,
420.63	and our Blackberry on our other hip,
422.701	and our laptop, presumably, on our laps.
425.435	And even if they're all shut off,
427.571	every minute that we're watching
427.571	our kid mutilate a soccer game,
430.666	we are also asking ourselves,
432.472	"""Should I answer this cell phone call?"
434.522	Should I respond to this email?
434.522	"Should I draft this letter?"""
437.419	And even if the answer
437.419	"to the question is ""no,"""
440	it's certainly going to make
440	the experience of your kid's soccer game
443.31	very different than it would've been.
445.666	So everywhere we look,
447.731	big things and small things,
447.731	material things and lifestyle things,
451.513	life is a matter of choice.
454.444	And the world we used
454.444	to live in looked like this.
458	[Well, actually,
458	they are written in stone.]
460.235	That is to say, there were some choices,
462.201	but not everything was a matter of choice.
464.226	And the world we now live in
464.226	looks like this.
466.385	[The Ten Commandments DYI Kit]
467.985	And the question is,
467.985	is this good news, or bad news?
473	"And the answer is, ""yes."""
476	(Laughter)
478.357	We all know what's good about it,
480.487	so I'm going to talk
480.487	about what's bad about it.
483	All of this choice has two effects,
486.471	two negative effects on people.
489.16	One effect, paradoxically,
491.636	is that it produces paralysis,
491.636	rather than liberation.
495.698	With so many options to choose from,
498	people find it very difficult
498	to choose at all.
502.293	I'll give you one very
502.293	dramatic example of this:
505	a study that was done of investments
505	in voluntary retirement plans.
511.109	A colleague of mine got access
511.109	to investment records from Vanguard,
516.455	the gigantic mutual-fund company
518.1	of about a million employees
518.1	and about 2,000 different workplaces.
522	And what she found
523.392	is that for every 10 mutual funds
523.392	the employer offered,
527.684	rate of participation
527.684	went down two percent.
532.27	You offer 50 funds -- 10 percent
532.27	fewer employees participate
536.522	than if you only offer five.
539.014	Why?
540.197	Because with 50 funds to choose from,
542.205	it's so damn hard to decide
542.205	which fund to choose,
546	that you'll just put it off
546	until tomorrow.
548.072	And then tomorrow,
549.295	and tomorrow, and tomorrow,
551.296	and of course tomorrow never comes.
553.325	Understand that not only does this mean
555.478	that people are going to have
555.478	to eat dog food when they retire
558.452	because they don't have
558.452	enough money put away,
560.658	it also means that making
560.658	the decision is so hard
563.269	that they pass up significant
563.269	matching money from the employer.
567	By not participating, they are passing up
567	as much as 5,000 dollars a year
571	from the employer,
572.321	who would happily
572.321	match their contribution.
575	So paralysis is a consequence
575	of having too many choices.
578.704	And I think it makes
578.704	the world look like this.
581.871	[And lastly, for all eternity,
581.871	French, bleu cheese, or ranch?]
586.23	(Laughter)
588	You really want to get the decision
588	right if it's for all eternity, right?
591.898	You don't want to pick the wrong
591.898	mutual fund, or the wrong salad dressing.
595.464	So that's one effect.
596.64	The second effect
597.798	is that even if we manage to overcome
597.798	the paralysis and make a choice,
603.38	we end up less satisfied
603.38	with the result of the choice
607.317	than we would be if we had
607.317	fewer options to choose from.
610.769	And there are several reasons for this.
613.362	One of them
614.393	is that with a lot of different
614.393	salad dressings to choose from,
617.374	if you buy one, and it's not perfect --
617.374	and what salad dressing is? --
620.741	it's easy to imagine
620.741	you could have made a different choice
623.584	that would have been better.
625.708	And what happens
627	is this imagined alternative induces you
627	to regret the decision you made,
631.826	and this regret subtracts
631.826	from the satisfaction
634.428	you get out of the decision you made,
636.23	even if it was a good decision.
638.61	The more options there are,
638.61	the easier it is to regret anything at all
642.358	that is disappointing
642.358	about the option that you chose.
645.342	Second, what economists
645.342	"call ""opportunity costs."""
648	Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning
650	of talking about how much the way
650	in which we value things
655	depends on what we compare them to.
657.391	Well, when there are lots
657.391	of alternatives to consider,
661	it is easy to imagine
661	the attractive features
664.179	of alternatives that you reject
667	that make you less satisfied
667	with the alternative that you've chosen.
671.657	Here's an example.
672.764	[I can't stop thinking about those other
672.764	available parking spaces on W 85th street]
676.697	Sorry if you're not New Yorkers.
678.261	Here's what you're
678.261	supposed to be thinking.
680.294	Here's this couple on the Hamptons.
682.08	Very expensive real estate.
683.4	Gorgeous beach. Beautiful day.
683.4	They have it all to themselves.
686.4	What could be better?
687.795	"""Well, damn it,"" this guy is thinking,"
689.696	"""It's August. Everybody"
689.696	in my Manhattan neighborhood is away.
693.694	I could be parking
693.694	"right in front of my building."""
697.817	And he spends two weeks nagged by the idea
701.436	that he is missing the opportunity,
703.314	day after day, to have
703.314	a great parking space.
708	Opportunity costs
709.419	subtract from the satisfaction
709.419	we get out of what we choose,
712.513	even when what we choose is terrific.
715.092	And the more options
715.092	there are to consider,
717.171	the more attractive
717.171	features of these options
719.401	are going to be reflected
719.401	by us as opportunity costs.
723.197	Here's another example.
725.174	(Laughter)
728.889	Now this cartoon makes a lot of points.
731.333	It makes points about living
731.333	in the moment as well,
734.755	and probably about doing things slowly.
736.756	But one point it makes
737.923	is that whenever
737.923	you're choosing one thing,
740.108	you're choosing not to do other things
742	that may have lots of attractive features,
744.088	and it's going to make
744.088	what you're doing less attractive.
747	Third: escalation of expectations.
749.325	This hit me when I went
749.325	to replace my jeans.
752.23	I wear jeans almost all the time.
754.531	There was a time
754.531	when jeans came in one flavor,
756.77	and you bought them,
756.77	and they fit like crap,
758.865	they were incredibly uncomfortable,
760.579	if you wore them
760.579	and washed them enough times,
763	they started to feel OK.
765	I went to replace my jeans after years
765	of wearing these old ones,
768.149	"and I said, ""I want"
768.149	"a pair of jeans. Here's my size."""
771.024	And the shopkeeper said,
772.234	"""Do you want slim fit,"
772.234	easy fit, relaxed fit?
775	You want button fly or zipper fly?
775	You want stonewashed or acid-washed?
778.405	Do you want them distressed?
779.794	"You want boot cut, tapered, blah blah."""
779.794	On and on he went.
782.655	My jaw dropped.
784.566	And after I recovered, I said,
786.09	"""I want the kind that used"
786.09	"to be the only kind."""
789.288	(Laughter)
794	He had no idea what that was,
796.001	(Laughter)
797.182	so I spent an hour trying on
797.182	all these damn jeans,
800	and I walked out of the store -- truth! --
802.071	with the best-fitting jeans
802.071	I had ever had.
804.736	I did better.
805.919	All this choice made
805.919	it possible for me to do better.
809.782	But --
810.878	I felt worse.
813.544	Why? I wrote a whole book
813.544	to try to explain this to myself.
817	The reason --
818.366	(Laughter)
822.745	The reason I felt worse is that,
825	with all of these options available,
827.738	my expectations about how good
827.738	a pair of jeans should be went up.
834	I had very low, no particular expectations
834	when they only came in one flavor.
838.238	When they came in 100 flavors, damn it,
838.238	one of them should've been perfect.
841.902	And what I got was good,
841.902	but it wasn't perfect.
844.263	And so I compared what I got
844.263	to what I expected,
847.373	and what I got was disappointing
847.373	in comparison to what I expected.
851.198	Adding options to people's lives
853.262	can't help but increase
853.262	the expectations people have
856.89	about how good those options will be.
859	And what that's going to produce
859	is less satisfaction with results,
862.215	even when they're good results.
864.778	Nobody in the world
864.778	of marketing knows this.
867.266	[It all looks so great.
867.266	I can't wait to be disappointed.]
870.059	Because if they did, you wouldn't all know
870.059	what this was about.
873.959	The truth is more like this.
876.521	[Everything was better back
876.521	when everything was worse]
879.614	The reason that everything was better
879.614	back when everything was worse
883.65	is that when everything was worse,
885.816	it was actually possible for people
887.611	to have experiences
887.611	that were a pleasant surprise.
891	Nowadays, the world we live in --
891	we affluent, industrialized citizens,
895.309	with perfection the expectation --
897.16	the best you can ever hope for
899.065	is that stuff is as good
899.065	as you expect it to be.
901.754	You will never be pleasantly surprised
903.62	because your expectations,
903.62	my expectations,
905.69	have gone through the roof.
907.063	The secret to happiness --
907.063	this is what you all came for --
910.508	the secret to happiness
913.081	is low expectations.
915.073	(Laughter)
918.617	[You'll do]
919.85	(Applause)
921.032	(Laughter)
924.365	I want to say --
925.641	just a little autobiographical moment --
928.308	that I actually am married to a wife,
931.322	and she's really quite wonderful.
933	I couldn't have done better.
934.598	I didn't settle.
936.182	But settling isn't
936.182	always such a bad thing.
939.158	Finally --
941.08	One consequence of buying
941.08	a bad-fitting pair of jeans
944.421	when there is only one kind to buy
946.493	is that when you are dissatisfied,
946.493	and you ask why,
949	who's responsible,
950.261	the answer is clear:
950.261	the world is responsible.
952.793	What could you do?
954.41	When there are hundreds
954.41	of different styles of jeans available,
957.402	and you buy one that is disappointing,
959.798	and you ask why, who's responsible?
962	It is equally clear that the answer
962	"to the question is ""you."""
967.16	You could have done better.
969	With a hundred different kinds
969	of jeans on display,
972	there is no excuse for failure.
974	And so when people make decisions,
976.408	and even though the results
976.408	of the decisions are good,
979	they feel disappointed about them;
981.75	they blame themselves.
983.751	Clinical depression has exploded
985.726	in the industrial world
985.726	in the last generation.
988.241	I believe a significant -- not the only,
988.241	but a significant -- contributor
992	to this explosion of depression,
992	and also suicide,
995.297	is that people have experiences
995.297	that are disappointing
998	because their standards are so high,
999.882	and then when they have to explain
999.882	these experiences to themselves,
1003.098	they think they're at fault.
1005	And so the net result is that we do
1005	better in general, objectively,
1009	and we feel worse.
1012	So let me remind you.
1014.578	This is the official dogma,
1014.578	the one that we all take to be true,
1019	and it's all false.
1021.641	It is not true.
1023.292	There's no question that some choice
1023.292	is better than none,
1027.515	but it doesn't follow from that
1029.638	that more choice
1029.638	is better than some choice.
1032	There's some magical amount.
1032	I don't know what it is.
1034.901	I'm pretty confident that we have
1034.901	long since passed the point
1037.818	where options improve our welfare.
1040.452	Now, as a policy matter --
1040.452	I'm almost done --
1043.332	as a policy matter,
1043.332	the thing to think about is this:
1046.841	what enables all of this choice
1049.487	in industrial societies
1049.487	is material affluence.
1054.383	There are lots of places in the world,
1056.311	and we have heard about several of them,
1058.3	where their problem
1058.3	is not that they have too much choice.
1061.086	Their problem
1061.086	is that they have too little.
1063.208	So the stuff I'm talking about
1063.208	is the peculiar problem
1066	of modern, affluent, Western societies.
1069.672	And what is so frustrating
1069.672	and infuriating is this:
1072.921	Steve Levitt talked to you yesterday
1075.215	about how these expensive
1075.215	and difficult-to-install child seats
1081.494	don't help.
1083.994	It's a waste of money.
1085.685	What I'm telling you
1086.994	is that these expensive,
1086.994	complicated choices --
1090.219	it's not simply that they don't help.
1092.407	They actually hurt.
1094	They actually make us worse off.
1096.928	If some of what enables
1096.928	people in our societies
1100.703	to make all of the choices we make
1102.726	were shifted to societies
1102.726	in which people have too few options,
1107.338	not only would those
1107.338	people's lives be improved,
1109.642	but ours would be improved also,
1112	which is what economists call
1112	"a ""Pareto-improving move."""
1115.001	Income redistribution will make
1115.001	everyone better off --
1118.737	not just poor people --
1120.173	because of how all this excess
1120.173	choice plagues us.
1123.714	So to conclude.
1124.786	[You can be anything
1124.786	you want to be -- no limits]
1127.12	You're supposed to read this cartoon,
1127.12	and, being a sophisticated person, say,
1130.783	"""Ah! What does this fish know?"
1132.262	You know, nothing is possible
1132.262	"in this fishbowl."""
1135.753	Impoverished imagination,
1135.753	a myopic view of the world --
1138.38	and that's the way I read it at first.
1140.238	The more I thought about it, however,
1142.079	the more I came to the view
1142.079	that this fish knows something.
1146	Because the truth of the matter
1148	is that if you shatter the fishbowl
1148	so that everything is possible,
1152.493	you don't have freedom.
1153.93	You have paralysis.
1156.302	If you shatter this fishbowl
1156.302	so that everything is possible,
1159.493	you decrease satisfaction.
1163.184	You increase paralysis,
1163.184	and you decrease satisfaction.
1166.78	Everybody needs a fishbowl.
1169	This one is almost
1169	certainly too limited --
1171.072	perhaps even for the fish,
1171.072	certainly for us.
1174.333	But the absence of some metaphorical
1174.333	fishbowl is a recipe for misery,
1178.722	and, I suspect, disaster.
1181	Thank you very much.
1182.294	(Applause)
