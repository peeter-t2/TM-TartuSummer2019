13.039	Hello, TEDWomen, what's up.
14.786	(Cheering)
16.075	Not good enough.
17.515	Hello, TEDWomen, what is up?
19.904	(Loud cheering)
21.849	My name is Maysoon Zayid,
24.374	and I am not drunk,
26.262	but the doctor who delivered me was.
28.953	He cut my mom six different times
32.507	in six different directions,
35.317	suffocating poor little me in the process.
37.935	As a result, I have cerebral palsy,
40.577	which means I shake all the time.
43.379	Look.
46.006	It's exhausting.
47.443	I'm like Shakira,
47.443	Shakira meets Muhammad Ali.
51.24	(Laughter)
54.493	CP is not genetic.
56.398	It's not a birth defect.
56.398	You can't catch it.
59.237	No one put a curse on my mother's uterus,
62.435	and I didn't get it because
62.435	my parents are first cousins,
65.824	which they are.
67.172	(Laughter)
71.538	It only happens from accidents,
73.752	like what happened to me on my birth day.
76.306	Now, I must warn you,
78.553	I'm not inspirational.
80.472	(Laughter)
81.497	And I don't want anyone in this room
81.497	to feel bad for me,
85.467	because at some point in your life,
87.697	you have dreamt of being disabled.
90.887	Come on a journey with me.
92.935	It's Christmas Eve, you're at the mall,
96.073	you're driving around in circles
96.073	looking for parking,
99.389	and what do you see?
101.435	Sixteen empty handicapped spaces.
104.214	(Laughter)
106.745	"And you're like, ""God,"
106.745	"can't I just be a little disabled?"""
109.782	(Laughter)
115.416	Also, I've got to tell you,
117.019	I've got 99 problems,
117.019	and palsy is just one.
120.715	(Laughter)
121.762	If there was an Oppression Olympics,
124.352	I would win the gold medal.
126.109	I'm Palestinian, Muslim,
129.266	I'm female, I'm disabled,
131.614	and I live in New Jersey.
133.507	(Laughter)
136.478	(Applause)
139.745	If you don't feel better
139.745	about yourself, maybe you should.
142.57	(Laughter)
143.625	Cliffside Park, New Jersey is my hometown.
145.976	I have always loved the fact
148.573	that my hood and my affliction
148.573	share the same initials.
152.607	I also love the fact
154.069	that if I wanted to walk
154.069	from my house to New York City, I could.
157.764	A lot of people with CP don't walk,
160.34	"but my parents didn't believe in ""can't."""
163.658	My father's mantra was,
165.472	"""You can do it, yes you can can."""
168.552	(Laughter)
172.091	So, if my three older sisters
172.091	were mopping,
175.143	I was mopping.
176.334	If my three older sisters
176.334	went to public school,
179.167	my parents would sue the school system
181.184	and guarantee that I went too,
183.431	and if we didn't all get A's,
185.221	we all got my mother's slipper.
187.373	(Laughter)
190.177	My father taught me how to walk
190.177	when I was five years old
193.102	by placing my heels on his feet
195.411	and just walking.
197.364	Another tactic that he used
199.067	is he would dangle
199.067	a dollar bill in front of me
201.99	and have me chase it.
203.711	(Laughter)
206.059	My inner stripper was very strong.
208.821	(Laughter)
210.434	Yeah.
211.987	No, by the first day of kindergarten,
213.804	I was walking like a champ
215.106	who had been punched one too many times.
217.487	(Laughter)
218.9	Growing up, there were
218.9	only six Arabs in my town,
222.42	and they were all my family.
223.796	(Laughter)
224.844	Now there are 20 Arabs in town,
226.951	and they are still all my family.
228.793	(Laughter)
229.85	I don't think anyone
229.85	even noticed we weren't Italian.
232.579	(Laughter)
236.574	(Applause)
240.311	This was before 9/11
242.026	and before politicians
242.026	thought it was appropriate
245.042	"to use ""I hate Muslims"""
245.042	as a campaign slogan.
249.096	The people that I grew up with
249.096	had no problem with my faith.
252.311	They did, however, seem very concerned
254.755	that I would starve
254.755	to death during Ramadan.
257.435	I would explain to them
257.435	that I have enough fat
259.61	to live off of for three whole months,
261.626	so fasting from sunrise
261.626	to sunset is a piece of cake.
264.996	(Laughter)
266.486	I have tap-danced on Broadway.
269.382	Yeah, on Broadway. It's crazy.
271.59	(Applause)
272.693	My parents couldn't
272.693	afford physical therapy,
274.835	so they sent me to dancing school.
277.402	I learned how to dance in heels,
279.072	which means I can walk in heels.
281.014	And I'm from Jersey,
282.175	and we are really concerned
282.175	with being chic,
285.212	so if my friends wore heels, so did I.
288.511	And when my friends went
288.511	and spent their summer vacations
291.529	on the Jersey Shore, I did not.
294.341	I spent my summers in a war zone,
296.579	because my parents were afraid
298.65	that if we didn't go back to Palestine
298.65	every single summer,
302.548	we'd grow up to be Madonna.
304.583	(Laughter)
309.984	Summer vacations often consisted
309.984	of my father trying to heal me,
315.073	so I drank deer's milk,
316.87	I had hot cups on my back,
318.912	I was dunked in the Dead Sea,
320.897	and I remember the water burning my eyes
323.506	"and thinking, ""It's working!"
323.506	"It's working!"""
325.995	(Laughter)
329.296	But one miracle cure we did find was yoga.
332.716	I have to tell you, it's very boring,
335.995	but before I did yoga,
337.474	I was a stand-up comedian
337.474	who can't stand up.
340.661	And now I can stand on my head.
343.737	My parents reinforced this notion
348.502	that I could do anything,
351.215	that no dream was impossible,
353.23	and my dream was to be
354.809	on the daytime soap opera
354.809	"""General Hospital."""
357.842	(Laughter)
359.048	I went to college
359.048	during affirmative action
361.499	and got a sweet scholarship to ASU,
363.529	Arizona State University,
365.674	because I fit every single quota.
368.166	(Laughter)
369.213	I was like the pet lemur
369.213	of the theater department.
373.406	Everybody loved me.
374.953	I did all the less-than-intelligent
374.953	kids' homework,
378.066	I got A's in all of my classes,
379.686	A's in all of their classes.
381.587	(Laughter)
383.138	Every time I did a scene
383.138	"from ""The Glass Menagerie,"""
386.271	my professors would weep.
388.689	But I never got cast.
391.333	Finally, my senior year,
392.952	ASU decided to do a show called
392.952	"""They Dance Real Slow in Jackson."""
396.886	It's a play about a girl with CP.
399.68	I was a girl with CP.
401.745	So I start shouting from the rooftops,
404.628	"""I'm finally going to get a part!"
406.555	I have cerebral palsy!
408.388	Free at last! Free at last!
410.565	"Thank God almighty, I'm free at last!"""
413.626	I didn't get the part.
414.984	(Laughter)
417.443	Sherry Brown got the part.
420.022	I went racing to the head
420.022	of the theater department
422.575	crying hysterically,
422.575	like someone shot my cat,
425.044	to ask her why,
426.169	and she said it was because
426.169	they didn't think I could do the stunts.
430.762	"I said, ""Excuse me,"
430.762	if I can't do the stunts,
433.483	"neither can the character."""
435.064	(Laughter)
439.232	(Applause)
442.976	This was a part
442.976	that I was literally born to play
448.004	they gave it to a non-palsy actress.
453.045	College was imitating life.
455.276	Hollywood has a sordid history
457.402	of casting able-bodied actors
457.402	to play disabled onscreen.
462.03	Upon graduating, I moved back home,
464.823	and my first acting gig
464.823	was as an extra on a daytime soap opera.
469.32	My dream was coming true.
471.14	And I knew that I would be promoted
473.53	"from ""Diner Diner"""
473.53	"to ""Wacky Best Friend"" in no time."
477.053	(Laughter)
478.335	But instead, I remained
478.335	a glorified piece of furniture
480.986	that you could only recognize
480.986	from the back of my head,
483.589	and it became clear to me
485.188	that casting directors
487.107	didn't hire fluffy,
487.107	ethnic, disabled actors.
491.089	They only hired perfect people.
493.462	But there were exceptions to the rule.
495.81	I grew up watching Whoopi Goldberg,
497.983	Roseanne Barr, Ellen,
499.919	and all of these women
499.919	had one thing in common:
502.454	they were comedians.
503.716	So I became a comic.
505.566	(Laughter)
508.845	(Applause)
511.858	My first gig was driving famous comics
515.535	from New York City to shows in New Jersey,
518.114	and I'll never forget the face
518.114	of the first comic I ever drove
521.599	when he realized that he was speeding
521.599	down the New Jersey Turnpike
525.563	with a chick with CP driving him.
527.76	(Laughter)
528.785	I've performed in clubs all over America,
531.354	and I've also performed
531.354	in Arabic in the Middle East,
534.906	uncensored and uncovered.
537.477	(Laughter)
538.549	Some people say I'm the first
538.549	stand-up comic in the Arab world.
542.29	I never like to claim first,
544.471	but I do know that they never heard
546.787	that nasty little rumor
546.787	that women aren't funny,
550.677	and they find us hysterical.
552.488	(Laughter)
555.55	In 2003, my brother
555.55	from another mother and father
559.594	Dean Obeidallah and I started
561.752	the New York Arab-American
561.752	Comedy Festival,
564.12	now in its 10th year.
566.094	Our goal was to change the negative image
566.094	of Arab-Americans in media,
571.563	while also reminding casting directors
574.365	that South Asian and Arab
574.365	are not synonymous.
577.13	(Laughter)
580.159	Mainstreaming Arabs was much, much easier
586.079	than conquering the challenge
586.079	against the stigma against disability.
590.849	My big break came in 2010.
593.196	I was invited to be a guest
593.196	on the cable news show
596.11	"""Countdown with Keith Olbermann."""
598.442	I walked in looking
598.442	like I was going to the prom,
601.444	and they shuffle me into a studio
603.578	and seat me on a spinning, rolling chair.
607.614	(Laughter)
609.158	So I looked at the stage manager
611.008	"and I'm like, ""Excuse me,"
611.008	"can I have another chair?"""
614.336	And she looked at me and she went,
616.062	"""Five, four, three, two ..."""
618.807	And we were live, right?
620.601	So I had to grip onto the anchor's desk
622.969	so that I wouldn't roll off
622.969	the screen during the segment,
626.758	and when the interview
626.758	was over, I was livid.
629.617	I had finally gotten
629.617	my chance and I blew it,
631.783	and I knew I would never get invited back.
634.988	But not only did Mr. Olbermann
634.988	invite me back,
637.996	he made me a full-time contributor,
640.322	and he taped down my chair.
643.047	(Laughter)
645.738	(Applause)
649.003	One fun fact I learned while on the air
649.003	with Keith Olbermann
652.72	was that humans
652.72	on the Internet are scumbags.
656.733	(Laughter)
657.758	People say children are cruel,
659.346	but I was never made fun of
659.346	as a child or an adult.
662.29	Suddenly, my disability
662.29	on the world wide web is fair game.
665.985	I would look at clips online
665.985	and see comments like,
669.606	"""Yo, why's she tweakin'?"""
672.266	"""Yo, is she retarded?"""
674.568	And my favorite,
674.568	"""Poor Gumby-mouth terrorist."
677.782	What does she suffer from?
679.604	"We should really pray for her."""
683.07	One commenter even suggested
683.07	that I add my disability to my credits:
687.684	screenwriter, comedian, palsy.
693.247	Disability is as visual as race.
696.12	If a wheelchair user can't play Beyoncé,
698.504	then Beyoncé can't play a wheelchair user.
701.702	The disabled are the largest —
703.789	Yeah, clap for that, man. Come on.
706.592	(Applause)
711.544	People with disabilities
711.544	are the largest minority in the world,
714.591	and we are the most underrepresented
714.591	in entertainment.
719.17	The doctors said that I wouldn't walk,
721.35	but I am here in front of you.
724.039	However, if I grew up with social media,
726.278	I don't think I would be.
728.099	I hope that together,
729.578	we can create more positive images
732.153	of disability in the media
732.153	and in everyday life.
735.882	Perhaps if there were
735.882	more positive images,
738.363	it would foster less hate on the Internet.
742.085	Or maybe not.
743.285	Maybe it still takes a village
743.285	to teach our children well.
748.46	My crooked journey has taken me
748.46	to some very spectacular places.
752.493	I got to walk the red carpet
755.467	flanked by soap diva Susan Lucci
758.246	and the iconic Loreen Arbus.
760.311	I got to act in a movie with Adam Sandler
762.972	and work with my idol,
762.972	the amazing Dave Matthews.
766.983	I toured the world as a headliner
766.983	on Arabs Gone Wild.
770.533	I was a delegate representing
770.533	the great state of New Jersey
776.227	at the 2008 DNC.
778.487	And I founded Maysoon's Kids,
780.989	a charity that hopes
780.989	to give Palestinian refugee children
785.048	a sliver of the chance my parents gave me.
787.972	But the one moment
787.972	that stands out the most
790.431	was when I got -- before this moment --
792.956	(Laughter)
796.634	(Applause)
800.43	But the one moment
800.43	that stands out the most
803.882	was when I got to perform
806.008	for the man who floats like a butterfly
808.234	and stings like a bee,
809.786	has Parkinson's and shakes just like me,
813.099	Muhammad Ali.
815.356	(Applause)
821.957	(Applause ends)
823.6	It was the only time
823.6	that my father ever saw me perform live,
828.203	and I dedicate this talk to his memory.
831.386	(Arabic) Allah yerhamak yaba.
833.782	(English) My name is Maysoon Zayid,
836.226	and if I can can, you can can.
839.437	(Cheering)
841.306	(Applause)
