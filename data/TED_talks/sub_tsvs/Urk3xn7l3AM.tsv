13.341	Someday, we may have robots
13.341	as smart as people,
17.809	artificial intelligence, AI.
20.307	How could that happen?
22.632	One route is that we'll just keep
22.632	accumulating better software,
25.84	like we've been doing for 70 years.
28.363	At past rates of progress,
28.363	that may take centuries.
31.958	Some say it'll happen a lot faster
34.332	as we discover grand new
34.332	powerful theories of intelligence.
38.227	I'm skeptical.
40.428	But a third scenario
43.513	is what I'm going to talk about today.
45.364	The idea is to port the software
45.364	from the human brain.
48.792	To do this, we're going to need
48.792	three technologies to be good enough,
52.117	and none of them are there yet.
54.237	First, we're going to need
54.237	lots of cheap, fast, parallel computers.
60.675	Second, we're going to need
60.675	to scan individual human brains
64.906	in fine spatial and chemical detail,
67.168	to see exactly what cells are where,
67.168	connected to what, of what type.
71.22	And third, we're going to need
71.22	computer models
75.6	of how each kind of brain cell works --
78.822	taking input signals,
78.822	changing interval state
81.426	and sending output signals.
82.744	If we have good enough models
82.744	of all the kinds of brain cells
86.586	and a good enough model of the brain,
88.373	we can put it together to make
88.373	a good enough model of an entire brain,
91.831	and that model would have the same
91.831	input-output behavior as the original.
95.858	So if you talk to it, it might talk back.
98.367	If you ask it to do things,
98.367	it might do them.
100.488	And if we could do that,
100.488	everything would change.
103.334	People have been talking
103.334	about this idea for decades,
105.926	"under the name of ""uploads."""
107.739	"I'm going to call them ""ems."""
110.175	When they talk about it, they say,
112.803	"""Is this even possible?"
114.658	If you made one, would it be conscious?
114.658	Or is it just an empty machine?
118.033	If you made one of me,
118.033	"is that me or someone else?"""
120.856	These are all fascinating questions
120.856	that I'm going to ignore ...
123.982	(Laughter)
126.861	because I see a neglected question:
128.974	What would actually happen?
132.26	I became obsessed with this question.
135.813	I spent four years trying to analyze it,
138.79	using standard academic tools,
138.79	to guess what would happen,
142.361	and I'm here to tell you what I found.
144.748	But be warned --
146.542	I'm not offering inspiration,
146.542	I'm offering analysis.
149.973	I see my job as telling you
149.973	what's most likely to happen
152.791	if we did the least to avoid it.
155.952	If you aren't at least a bit disturbed
155.952	by something I tell you here,
159.278	you're just not paying attention.
160.896	(Laughter)
162.271	OK, the first thing I can tell you
164.891	is that ems spend most
164.891	of their life in virtual reality.
168.639	This is what you might look like
168.639	if you were using virtual reality.
173.894	And this is what you might see:
177.064	sunlight glinting off of water,
177.064	you might hear gulls flying above,
180.684	you might even feel the wind
180.684	on your cheeks or smell seawater,
183.739	with advanced hardware.
185.902	Now, if you were to spend
185.902	a lot of time here,
188.023	you might want a dashboard
189.313	where you could do things like
189.313	make a phone call,
191.831	move to a new virtual world,
193.405	check your bank account.
195.78	Now, while this is what
195.78	you would look like in virtual reality,
199.461	this is what an em
199.461	would look like in virtual reality.
202.613	It's computer hardware
202.613	sitting in a server rack somewhere.
205.393	But still, it could see
205.393	and experience the same thing.
209.102	But some things are different for ems.
211.51	First, while you'll probably always notice
211.51	that virtual reality isn't entirely real,
216.32	to an em, it can feel as real to them
216.32	as this room feels to you now
219.598	or as anything ever feels.
221.26	And ems also have
221.26	some more action possibilities.
224.209	For example, your mind just always
224.209	runs at the same speed,
226.949	but an em can add more or less
226.949	computer hardware to run faster or slower,
230.814	and therefore, if the world around them
230.814	seems to be going too fast,
234.526	they can just speed up their mind,
236.169	and the world around them
236.169	would seem to slow down.
238.543	In addition, an em can make
238.543	a copy of itself at that moment.
243.94	This copy would remember
243.94	everything the same,
246.061	and if it starts out with the same speed,
246.061	looking at the same speed,
249.401	it might even need to be told,
249.401	"""You are the copy."""
252.599	And em could make archive copies,
254.196	and with enough archives,
256.044	an em can be immortal --
258.14	in principle, though not
258.14	usually in practice.
261.231	And an em can move its brain,
261.231	the computer that represents its brain,
264.787	from one physical location to another.
267.857	Ems can actually move around the world
267.857	at the speed of light,
271.199	and by moving to a new location,
272.755	they can interact more quickly
272.755	with ems near that new location.
276.043	So far, I've been talking about
276.043	what ems can do.
281.047	What do ems choose to do?
284.225	To understand that, we'll need
284.225	to understand three key facts.
287.916	First, ems by definition do what
287.916	the human they emulate would do
294.091	in the same situation.
296.125	So their lives and behavior
296.125	are very human.
298.792	They're mainly different because
298.792	they're living in a different world.
302.113	Second, ems need
302.113	real resources to survive.
305.435	You need food and shelter or you'll die.
309.122	Also, ems need computer hardware,
309.122	energy, cooling, or they can't exist.
313.456	For every subjective minute
313.456	that an em experiences,
316.055	someone, usually that em,
316.055	had to work to pay for it.
319.956	Third, ems are poor.
321.67	(Laughter)
323.535	The em population can grow
323.535	quicker than the em economy,
326.194	so that means wages fall down
326.194	to em subsistence levels.
329.553	That means ems have to be working
329.553	most of the time.
332.181	So that means
332.181	this is what ems usually see:
335.504	beautiful and luxurious, but desks --
338.076	they're working most of the time.
340.103	Now, a subsistence wage scenario,
340.103	you might think, is exotic and strange,
344.096	but it's actually the usual case
344.096	in human history,
346.461	and it's how pretty much
346.461	all wild animals have ever lived,
349.199	so we know what humans do
349.199	in this situation.
351.499	Humans basically do
351.499	what it takes to survive,
354.453	and this is what lets me say
354.453	so much about the em world.
358.572	When creatures are rich, like you,
360.985	you have to know a lot
360.985	about what they want
363.032	to figure out what they do.
364.397	When creatures are poor,
365.591	you know that they mostly do
365.591	what it takes to survive.
368.596	So we've been talking about the em world
368.596	from the point of view of the ems --
372.244	now, let's step back
372.244	and look at their whole world.
374.783	First, the em world grows
374.783	much faster than ours,
377.887	roughly a hundred times faster.
380.375	So the amount of change
380.375	we would experience in a century or two,
383.562	they would experience in a year or two.
385.444	And I'm not really willing to project
385.444	this age much beyond that,
388.506	because plausibly by then something else
388.506	will happen, I don't know what.
391.967	Second, the typical emulation
391.967	runs even faster,
394.349	roughly a thousand times human speed.
397.136	So for them, they experience
397.136	thousands of years in this year or two,
402.5	and for them, the world around them
402.5	is actually changing more slowly
405.716	than your world seems to change for you.
408.097	Third, ems are crammed together
408.097	in a small number of very dense cities.
412.605	This is not only how they see
412.605	themselves in virtual reality,
416.095	it's also how they actually are
416.095	physically crammed together.
419.294	So at em speeds, physical travel
419.294	feels really painfully slow,
423.204	so most em cities are self-sufficient,
425.55	most war is cyber war,
427.324	and most of the rest of the earth
427.324	away from the em cities
430.039	is left to the humans, because the ems
430.039	really aren't that interested in it.
434.072	Speaking of humans,
435.604	you were wanting to hear about that.
437.412	Humans must retire, at once, for good.
442.707	They just can't compete.
444.738	Now, humans start out owning
444.738	all of the capital in this world.
447.834	The economy grows very fast,
447.834	their wealth grows very fast.
450.727	Humans get rich, collectively.
454.048	As you may know, most humans today
454.048	don't actually own that much
457.311	besides their ability to work,
459.176	so between now and then,
459.176	they need to acquire sufficient assets,
462.748	insurance or sharing arrangements,
464.605	or they may starve.
466.09	I highly recommend avoiding this outcome.
468.129	(Laughter)
470.285	Now, you might wonder,
471.532	why would ems let humans exist?
473.034	Why not kill them, take their stuff?
475.521	But notice we have many
475.521	unproductive retirees around us today,
478.622	and we don't kill them
478.622	and take their stuff.
480.751	(Laughter)
482.409	In part, that's because it would disrupt
482.409	the institutions we share with them.
487.344	Other groups would wonder who's next,
489.484	so plausibly, ems may well let humans
489.484	retire in peace during the age of em.
494.234	You should worry more that
494.234	the age of em only lasts a year or two
497.307	and you don't know what happens next.
501.027	Ems are very much like humans,
503.417	but they are not like the typical human.
506.258	The typical em is a copy
506.258	of the few hundred most productive humans.
513.149	So in fact, they are as elite,
513.149	compared to the typical human,
516.753	as the typical billionaire,
516.753	Nobel Prize winner,
519.039	Olympic gold medalist, head of state.
522.347	Ems look on humans
522.347	perhaps with nostalgia and gratitude,
526.673	but not so much respect,
528.205	which is, if you think about it,
528.205	how you think about your ancestors.
531.424	We know many things about how humans
531.424	differ in terms of productivity.
534.715	We can just use those
534.715	to predict features of ems --
537.158	for example, they tend to be smart,
537.158	conscientious, hard-working,
540.278	married, religious, middle-aged.
542.281	These are features of ems.
543.917	Em world also contains enormous variety.
546.53	Not only does it continue on with most
546.53	of the kinds of variety that humans do,
550.222	including variety of industry
550.222	and profession,
552.641	they also have many new kinds of variety,
554.827	and one of the most important
554.827	is mind speed.
557.532	Ems can plausibly go from human speed
561.39	up to a million times
561.39	faster than human speed,
564.294	and down to a billion times
564.294	slower than human speed.
568.046	Faster ems tend to have
568.046	markers of high status.
570.836	They embody more wealth.
570.836	They win arguments.
573.02	They sit at premium locations.
574.707	Slower ems are mostly retirees,
576.551	and they are like the ghosts
576.551	of our literature.
578.825	If you recall, ghosts are all around us --
580.89	you can interact with them
580.89	if you pay the price.
583.184	But they don't know much,
583.184	they can't influence much,
585.637	and they're obsessed with the past,
585.637	so what's the point?
588.359	(Laughter)
589.534	Ems also have more variety
589.534	in the structure of their lives.
592.515	This is your life: you start
592.515	and you end, really simple.
595.221	This is the life of an em,
596.858	who every day splits off
596.858	some short-term copies
599.175	to do short-term tasks and then end.
601.157	We'll talk more about
601.157	those short term versions in a moment,
605.308	but they are much more efficient
606.942	because they don't have to rest
606.942	for the next day.
609.331	This em is more opportunistic.
610.863	They make more copies of themselves
610.863	when there's more demand for that.
614.174	They don't know which way
614.174	the future's going.
616.295	This is an em designer,
617.618	who conceives of a large system
619.244	and then breaks recursively into copies
619.244	who elaborate that,
622.753	so ems can implement
622.753	larger, more coherent designs.
626.189	This an emulation plumber
627.571	who remembers that every day,
627.571	for the last 20 years,
630.04	they only ever worked
630.04	two hours a day, a life of leisure.
632.845	But what really happened is,
632.845	every day they had a thousand copies,
635.966	each of whom did a two-hour plumbing job,
637.943	and only one of them
637.943	went on to the next day.
640.132	Objectively, they're working
640.132	well over 99 percent of the time.
643.155	Subjectively, they remember
643.155	a life of leisure.
645.369	(Laughter)
646.401	This, again, is you.
646.401	You start and you end.
648.513	This could be you
648.513	if at the start of party,
650.649	you took a drug that meant
650.649	you would not remember that party
653.484	ever after that day.
655.126	Some people do this, I'm told.
657.49	Toward the end of the party,
659.149	will you say to yourself,
659.149	"""I'm about to die, this is terrible."
662.099	That person tomorrow isn't me,
662.099	"because they won't remember what I do."""
665.426	"Or you could say, ""I will go on tomorrow."
665.426	"I just won't remember what I did."""
669.411	This is an em who splits off
669.411	a short-term copy
671.864	to do a short-term task and then end.
673.752	They have the same two
673.752	attitude possibilities.
675.982	"They can say, ""I'm a new short-term"
675.982	"creature with a short life. I hate this."""
679.685	"Or ""I'm a part of a larger creature"
679.685	"who won't remember this part."""
682.843	I predict they'll have
682.843	that second attitude,
684.985	not because it's philosophically correct,
684.985	but because it helps them get along.
688.685	Today, if the president says
688.685	we must invade Iraq,
691.037	"and you say, ""Why?"""
692.212	"and they say, ""State secret,"""
693.618	you're not sure if you can trust them,
695.492	but for ems, a copy of the president
695.492	and a copy of you can go inside a safe,
699.132	explain all their secret reasons,
700.81	and then one bit comes out
700.81	from your copy to yourself,
703.365	telling you if you were convinced.
705.245	So now you can know
705.245	there is a good reason.
707.796	I know you guys are all eager
707.796	to evaluate this world.
710.365	You're eager to decide
710.365	if you love it or hate it.
712.723	But think: your ancestors
712.723	from thousands of years ago
715.29	would have loved or hated your world
717.067	based on the first few things
717.067	they heard about it,
719.512	because your world
719.512	is really just weird.
721.399	So before judging a strange future world,
721.399	you should really learn a lot about it,
725.237	maybe read a whole book about it,
726.851	and then, if you don't like it,
726.851	work to change it.
729.229	Thank you.
730.272	(Applause)
