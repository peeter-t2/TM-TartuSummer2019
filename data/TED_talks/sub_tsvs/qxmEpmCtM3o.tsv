12.58	When I was a kid, I was obsessed
12.58	with the Guinness Book of World Records,
17.14	and I really wanted
17.14	to set a world record myself.
20.62	But there was just one small problem:
23.34	I had absolutely no talent.
26.34	So I decided to set
26.34	a world record in something
29.78	that demanded absolutely no skill at all.
33.66	I decided to set a world record
36.42	in crawling.
39.5	(Laughter)
42.5	Now, the record at the time
42.5	was 12 and a half miles,
47.66	and for some reason,
47.66	this seemed totally manageable.
50.86	(Laughter)
54.46	I recruited my friend Anne,
55.98	and together we decided,
55.98	we didn't even need to train.
59.58	(Laughter)
62.86	And on the day of our record attempt,
64.7	we put furniture pads
64.7	on the outside of our good luck jeans
68.38	and we set off,
70.54	and right away, we were in trouble,
73.62	because the denim was against our skin
75.74	and it began to chafe,
77.339	and soon our knees were being chewed up.
80.74	Hours in,
82.98	it began to rain.
85.34	Then, Anne dropped out.
89.22	Then, it got dark.
92.5	Now, by now, my knees
92.5	were bleeding through my jeans,
95.34	and I was hallucinating from the cold
97.58	and the pain and the monotony.
100.3	And to give you an idea
100.3	of the suffer-fest that I was undergoing,
104.94	the first lap around
104.94	the high school track took 10 minutes.
109.7	The last lap took almost 30.
113.82	After 12 hours of crawling,
118.26	I stopped,
119.62	and I had gone eight and a half miles.
123.7	So I was short of
123.7	the 12-and-a-half-mile record.
127.38	Now, for many years, I thought
127.38	this was a story of abject failure,
131.94	but today I see it differently,
134.46	because when I was
134.46	attempting the world record,
137.34	I was doing three things.
138.86	I was getting outside my comfort zone,
141.22	I was calling upon my resilience,
143.5	and I was finding confidence in myself
146.26	and my own decisions.
148.26	I didn't know it then,
149.54	but those are not
149.54	the attributes of failure.
153.3	Those are the attributes of bravery.
157.1	Now, in 1989, at the age of 26,
159.7	I became a San Francisco firefighter,
162.62	and I was the 15th woman
162.62	in a department of 1,500 men.
166.82	(Applause)
173.06	And as you can imagine, when I arrived
174.94	there were many doubts
174.94	about whether we could do the job.
177.66	"So even though I was a 5'10"","
183.02	and someone who could endure
187.42	(Laughter)
189.06	I knew I still had to prove
189.06	my strength and fitness.
192.1	So one day a call came in for a fire,
193.94	and sure enough,
193.94	when my engine group pulled up,
196.203	there was black smoke billowing
196.203	from a building off an alleyway.
200.26	And I was with a big guy named Skip,
202.5	and he was on the nozzle,
202.5	and I was right behind,
205.26	and it was a typical sort of fire.
207.1	It was smoky, it was hot,
210.5	and all of a sudden,
212.22	there was an explosion,
214.02	and Skip and I were blown backwards,
216.22	my mask was knocked sideways,
218.38	and there was this moment of confusion.
220.66	And then I picked myself up,
224.1	I groped for the nozzle,
225.94	and I did what a firefighter
225.94	was supposed to do:
228.46	I lunged forward,
230.22	opened up the water
231.7	and I tackled the fire myself.
234.54	The explosion had been caused
234.54	by a water heater,
236.82	so nobody was hurt,
236.82	and ultimately it was not a big deal,
239.54	but later Skip came up to me and said,
242.82	"""Nice job, Caroline,"""
244.58	in this surprised sort of voice.
246.9	(Laughter)
249.42	And I was confused, because
249.42	the fire hadn't been difficult physically,
253.26	so why was he looking at me
253.26	with something like astonishment?
258.3	And then it became clear:
259.98	Skip, who was by the way a really nice guy
263.14	and an excellent firefighter,
265.38	not only thought
265.38	that women could not be strong,
268.779	he thought that they
268.779	could not be brave either.
272.58	And he wasn't the only one.
275.38	Friends, acquaintances and strangers,
277.66	men and women throughout my career
279.74	ask me over and over,
281.22	"""Caroline, all that fire, all that danger,"
285.18	"aren't you scared?"""
287.14	Honestly, I never heard
287.14	a male firefighter asked this.
290.74	And I became curious.
293.02	Why wasn't bravery expected of women?
297.58	Now, the answer began to come
299.38	when a friend of mine lamented to me
301.14	that her young daughter
301.14	was a big scaredy-cat,
303.62	and so I began to notice,
305.58	and yes, the daughter was anxious,
308.3	but more than that,
308.3	the parents were anxious.
311.94	Most of what they said to her
311.94	when she was outside began with,
315.22	"""Be careful,"" ""Watch out,"" or ""No."""
320.74	Now, my friends were not bad parents.
323.42	They were just doing what most parents do,
326.14	which is cautioning their daughters
326.14	much more than they caution their sons.
331.26	There was a study involving
331.26	a playground fire pole, ironically,
336.3	in which researchers saw that little girls
336.3	were very likely to be warned
340.42	by both their moms and dads
340.42	about the fire pole's risk,
344.14	and if the little girls
344.14	still wanted to play on the fire pole,
347.62	a parent was very likely to assist her.
351.1	But the little boys?
352.98	They were encouraged
352.98	to play on the fire pole
355.78	despite any trepidations
355.78	that they might have,
358.74	and often the parents offered
358.74	guidance on how to use it on their own.
365.3	So what message does this send
365.3	to both boys and girls?
369.74	Well, that girls are fragile
369.74	and more in need of help,
373.7	and that boys can and should
373.7	master difficult tasks by themselves.
378.34	It says that girls should be fearful
381.1	and boys should be gutsy.
384.98	Now, the irony is that at this young age,
387.5	girls and boys are actually
387.5	very alike physically.
390.02	In fact, girls are often
390.02	stronger until puberty,
392.7	and more mature.
394.3	And yet we adults act
396.3	as if girls are more fragile
398.66	and more in need of help,
400.62	and they can't handle as much.
402.98	This is the message
402.98	that we absorb as kids,
405.58	and this is the message
405.58	that fully permeates as we grow up.
409.3	We women believe it, men believe it,
411.78	and guess what?
413.34	As we become parents,
413.34	we pass it on to our children,
416.7	and so it goes.
418.54	Well, so now I had my answer.
421.06	This is why women, even firewomen,
423.66	were expected to be scared.
425.78	This is why women often are scared.
429.74	Now, I know some of you
429.74	won't believe me when I tell you this,
432.9	but I am not against fear.
436.02	I know it's an important emotion,
436.02	and it's there to keep us safe.
439.86	But the problem is
439.86	when fear is the primary reaction
443.06	that we teach and encourage in girls
445.42	whenever they face something
445.42	outside their comfort zone.
449.58	So I was a paraglider pilot
449.58	for many years --
453.62	(Applause)
455.54	and a paraglider is a parachute-like wing,
457.98	and it does fly very well,
461.74	but to many people I realize
461.74	it looks just like a bedsheet
464.66	with strings attached.
466.18	(Laughter)
467.38	And I spent a lot of time on mountaintops
469.86	inflating this bedsheet,
471.46	running off and flying.
474.38	And I know what you're thinking.
475.98	You're like, Caroline,
475.98	a little fear would make sense here.
480.62	And you're right, it does.
482.5	I assure you, I did feel fear.
485.02	But on that mountaintop,
486.3	waiting for the wind
486.3	to come in just right,
488.38	I felt so many other things, too:
490.62	exhilaration, confidence.
493.82	I knew I was a good pilot.
495.62	I knew the conditions were good,
495.62	or I wouldn't be there.
498.66	I knew how great it was going to be
498.66	a thousand feet in the air.
502.22	So yes, fear was there,
504.86	but I would take a good hard look at it,
507.06	assess just how relevant it was
509.74	and then put it where it belonged,
512.1	which was more often than not
513.54	behind my exhilaration, my anticipation
517.54	and my confidence.
519.22	So I'm not against fear.
521.26	I'm just pro-bravery.
526.34	Now, I'm not saying
526.34	your girls must be firefighters
529.58	or that they should be paragliders,
531.82	but I am saying that we are raising
531.82	our girls to be timid, even helpless,
537.42	and it begins when we caution them
537.42	against physical risk.
541.06	The fear we learn
541.06	and the experiences we don't
543.7	stay with us as we become women
545.54	and morphs into all those things
545.54	that we face and try to shed:
549.82	our hesitation in speaking out,
552.14	our deference so that we can be liked
554.82	and our lack of confidence
554.82	in our own decisions.
558.78	So how do we become brave?
562.26	Well, here's the good news.
564.06	Bravery is learned,
566.06	and like anything learned,
567.5	it just needs to be practiced.
569.86	So first,
571.46	we have to take a deep breath
573.18	and encourage our girls
575.26	to skateboard, climb trees
577.98	and clamber around
577.98	on that playground fire pole.
581.3	This is what my own mother did.
583.5	She didn't know it then,
585.3	but researchers have a name for this.
587.62	They call it risky play,
589.74	and studies show that risky play
589.74	is really important for kids, all kids,
594.22	because it teaches hazard assessment,
596.82	it teaches delayed gratification,
599.02	it teaches resilience,
600.82	it teaches confidence.
602.9	In other words,
604.38	when kids get outside
604.38	and practice bravery,
607.7	they learn valuable life lessons.
612.42	Second, we have to stop
612.42	cautioning our girls willy-nilly.
617.18	So notice next time you say,
619.62	"""Watch out, you're going to get hurt,"""
621.5	"or, ""Don't do that, it's dangerous."""
624.3	And remember that often
624.3	what you're really telling her
627.9	is that she shouldn't be pushing herself,
630.34	that she's really not good enough,
632.54	that she should be afraid.
636.14	Third,
637.9	we women have to start
637.9	practicing bravery, too.
641.7	We cannot teach our girls
641.7	until we teach ourselves.
645.78	So here's another thing:
647.7	fear and exhilaration
650.82	feel very similar --
653.58	the shaky hands,
653.58	the heightened heart rate,
656.18	the nervous tension,
657.58	and I'm betting that for many of you
659.34	the last time you thought
659.34	you were scared out of your wits,
662.18	you may have been feeling
662.18	mostly exhilaration,
665.14	and now you've missed an opportunity.
667.54	So practice.
669.38	And while girls should be getting
669.38	outside to learn to be gutsy,
672.38	I get that adults don't want
672.38	to get on hoverboards or climb trees,
678.5	so we all should be practicing
681.98	at home, in the office
684.22	and even right here getting up the guts
686.34	to talk to someone that you really admire.
690.18	Finally, when your girl is, let's say,
694.22	on her bike on the top of the steep hill
696.34	that she insists
696.34	she's too scared to go down,
699.78	guide her to access her bravery.
702.54	Ultimately, maybe that hill
702.54	really is too steep,
706.82	but she'll come to that conclusion
706.82	through courage, not fear.
711.74	Because this is not
711.74	about the steep hill in front of her.
715.66	This is about the life ahead of her
718.22	and that she has the tools
720.02	to handle and assess
722.14	all the dangers
722.14	that we cannot protect her from,
725.42	all the challenges that we won't
725.42	be there to guide her through,
729.98	everything that our girls here
732.46	and around the world
733.86	face in their future.
738.02	So by the way,
740.22	the world record for crawling today --
743.02	(Laughter)
745.42	is 35.18 miles,
750.34	and I would really love
750.34	to see a girl go break that.
753.82	(Applause)
