15.402	So I'm a doctor, but I kind of slipped
15.402	sideways into research,
18.49	and now I'm an epidemiologist.
20.212	And nobody really knows
20.212	what epidemiology is.
22.38	Epidemiology is the science
22.38	of how we know in the real world
25.557	if something is good
25.557	for you or bad for you.
27.691	And it's best understood through example
29.675	as the science of those crazy,
29.675	wacky newspaper headlines.
34.35	And these are just some of the examples.
36.707	These are from the Daily Mail.
38.181	Every country in the world
38.181	has a newspaper like this.
40.724	It has this bizarre,
40.724	ongoing philosophical project
43.098	of dividing all the inanimate
43.098	objects in the world
45.477	into the ones that either cause
45.477	or prevent cancer.
47.854	Here are some of the things
47.854	they said cause cancer:
50.386	divorce, Wi-Fi, toiletries and coffee.
52.391	Some things they say prevent cancer:
54.179	crusts, red pepper, licorice and coffee.
56.125	So you can see there are contradictions.
58.055	Coffee both causes and prevents cancer.
60.079	As you start to read on, you can see
61.827	that maybe there's some
61.827	political valence behind some of this.
64.79	For women, housework
64.79	prevents breast cancer,
66.875	but for men, shopping
66.875	could make you impotent.
69.944	(Laughter)
70.977	So we know that we need to start
70.977	unpicking the science behind this.
75.505	And what I hope to show is that unpicking
75.505	the evidence behind dodgy claims
81.062	isn't a kind of nasty, carping activity;
84.806	it's socially useful.
86.191	But it's also an extremely valuable
86.191	explanatory tool,
90.773	because real science is about
90.773	critically appraising the evidence
93.832	for somebody else's position.
95.249	That's what happens in academic journals,
97.232	it's what happens
97.232	at academic conferences --
99.32	the Q&amp;A session after a postdoc
99.32	presents data is often a bloodbath.
102.653	And nobody minds that;
102.653	we actively welcome it.
104.835	It's like a consenting
104.835	intellectual S&amp;M activity.
107.897	(Laughter)
109.076	So what I'm going to show you
109.076	is all of the main things,
112.094	all of the main features of my discipline,
112.094	evidence-based medicine.
115.308	And I will talk you through all of these
115.308	and demonstrate how they work,
119.215	exclusively using examples
119.215	of people getting stuff wrong.
122.581	We'll start with the absolute weakest
122.581	form of evidence known to man,
126.359	and that is authority.
128.009	In science, we don't care how many letters
128.009	you have after your name --
131.473	we want to know what your reasons are
131.473	for believing something.
134.509	How do you know that something
134.509	is good for us or bad for us?
137.529	But we're also unimpressed by authority
137.529	because it's so easy to contrive.
141.734	This is somebody called
141.734	Dr. Gillian McKeith, PhD,
144.14	or, to give her full
144.14	medical title, Gillian McKeith.
147.333	(Laughter)
150.017	Again, every country
150.017	has somebody like this.
152.197	She is our TV diet guru.
153.865	She has five series
153.865	of prime-time television,
156.796	giving out very lavish
156.796	and exotic health advice.
159.138	She, it turns out, has a non-accredited
159.138	correspondence course PhD
163.017	from somewhere in America.
164.321	She also boasts that she's a certified
164.321	professional member
167.11	of the American Association
167.11	of Nutritional Consultants,
169.726	which sounds very glamorous;
169.726	you get a certificate.
172.149	This one belongs to my dead cat, Hettie.
172.149	She was a horrible cat.
175.19	You go to the website, fill out the form,
177.178	give them $60, it arrives in the post.
179.023	That's not the only reason
179.023	we think this person is an idiot.
181.88	She also says things like
181.88	eat lots of dark green leaves,
184.553	they contain chlorophyll
184.553	and really oxygenate your blood.
187.434	And anybody who's done
187.434	school biology remembers
189.657	that chlorophyll and chloroplasts
189.657	only make oxygen in sunlight,
192.893	and it's quite dark in your bowels
192.893	after you've eaten spinach.
196.047	Next, we need proper science,
196.047	proper evidence.
198.57	"So: ""Red wine can help"
198.57	"prevent breast cancer."""
201.036	This is a headline
201.036	from The Daily Telegraph in the UK.
203.623	"""A glass of red wine a day could help"
203.623	"prevent breast cancer."""
206.565	So you find this paper, and find
206.565	that it is a real piece of science.
209.825	It's a description of the changes
209.825	in the behavior of one enzyme
212.846	when you drip a chemical
212.846	extracted from some red grape skin
216.039	onto some cancer cells
217.638	in a dish on a bench
217.638	in a laboratory somewhere.
220.862	And that's a really useful thing
220.862	to describe in a scientific paper.
224.978	But on the question of your own personal
224.978	risk of getting breast cancer
228.36	if you drink red wine,
229.535	it tells you absolutely bugger all.
231.24	Actually, it turns out
231.24	that your risk of breast cancer
233.801	increases slightly with every amount
233.801	of alcohol you drink.
236.788	So what we want are studies
236.788	in real human people.
240.66	And here's another example.
242.26	"This is from Britain's ""leading"""
242.26	diet nutritionist in the Daily Mirror,
246.445	our second-biggest selling newspaper.
248.243	"""An Australian study in 2001"
248.243	found that olive oil,
250.625	in combination with fruits,
250.625	vegetables and pulses,
252.991	offers measurable protection
252.991	"against skin wrinklings,"""
255.563	and give the advice:
256.738	"""If you eat olive oil and vegetables,"
256.738	"you'll have fewer wrinkles."""
259.892	They helpfully tell you
259.892	how to find the paper,
262.074	and what you find
262.074	is an observational study.
264.185	Obviously, nobody has been able
264.185	to go back to 1930,
267.13	get all the people born
267.13	in one maternity unit,
269.647	and half of them eat lots
269.647	of fruit and veg and olive oil,
272.367	half of them eat McDonald's,
273.737	and then we see how many wrinkles
273.737	you've got later.
276.164	You have to take a snapshot
276.164	of how people are now.
278.601	And what you find is, of course:
280.189	people who eat veg and olive oil
280.189	have fewer wrinkles.
282.714	But that's because people who eat
282.714	fruit and veg and olive oil are freaks --
286.479	they're not normal, they're like you;
286.479	they come to events like this.
290.327	(Laughter)
291.41	They're posh, they're wealthy,
291.41	less likely to have outdoor jobs,
294.453	less likely to do manual labor,
295.993	they have better social support,
295.993	are less likely to smoke;
298.757	for a host of fascinating, interlocking
300.655	social, political and cultural reasons,
302.548	they're less likely to have wrinkles.
304.344	That doesn't mean
304.344	it's the vegetables or olive oil.
306.77	(Laughter)
308.04	So ideally, what you want
308.04	to do is a trial.
310.557	People think they're familiar
310.557	with the idea of a trial.
313.161	Trials are old; the first one
313.161	was in the Bible, Daniel 1:12.
316.001	It's straightforward: take a bunch
316.001	of people, split them in half,
319.1	treat one group one way,
319.1	the other group, the other way.
321.75	A while later, you see
321.75	what happened to each of them.
324.297	I'm going to tell you about one trial,
326.155	which is probably
326.155	the most well-reported trial
328.345	in the UK news media over the past decade.
330.374	This is the trial of fish oil pills.
332.134	The claim: fish oil pills improve
332.134	school performance and behavior
335.311	in mainstream children.
336.486	"They said, ""We did a trial."
337.804	All the previous ones were positive,
337.804	"this one will be too."""
340.6	That should ring alarm bells:
342.006	if you know the answer to your trial,
342.006	you shouldn't be doing one.
345.09	Either you've rigged it by design,
346.742	or you've got enough data so there's
346.742	no need to randomize people anymore.
350.203	So this is what they were going
350.203	to do in their trial:
352.728	They were taking 3,000 children,
354.829	they were going to give them these huge
354.829	fish oil pills, six of them a day,
358.507	and then, a year later, measure
358.507	their school exam performance
361.644	and compare their performance
363.442	against what they predicted
363.442	their exam performance would have been
366.622	if they hadn't had the pills.
368.722	Now, can anybody spot
368.722	a flaw in this design?
371.553	(Laughter)
372.592	And no professors
372.592	of clinical trial methodology
374.859	are allowed to answer this question.
376.609	So there's no control group.
378.634	But that sounds really techie, right?
378.634	That's a technical term.
381.993	The kids got the pills,
381.993	and their performance improved.
384.65	What else could it possibly
384.65	be if it wasn't the pills?
388.128	They got older; we all develop over time.
390.425	And of course, there's the placebo effect,
392.614	one of the most fascinating things
392.614	in the whole of medicine.
395.476	It's not just taking a pill
395.476	and performance or pain improving;
398.413	it's about our beliefs and expectations,
398.413	the cultural meaning of a treatment.
402.1	And this has been demonstrated
402.1	in a whole raft of fascinating studies
405.394	comparing one kind of placebo
405.394	against another.
407.635	So we know, for example,
408.817	that two sugar pills a day
408.817	are a more effective treatment
411.554	for gastric ulcers
412.797	than one sugar pill.
414.061	Two sugar pills a day beats one a day.
416.046	That's an outrageous
416.046	and ridiculous finding, but it's true.
418.845	We know from three different studies
418.845	on three different types of pain
422.166	that a saltwater injection
422.166	is a more effective treatment
424.835	than a sugar pill, a dummy pill
424.835	with no medicine in it,
427.464	not because the injection or pills
427.464	do anything physically to the body,
430.832	but because an injection feels
430.832	like a much more dramatic intervention.
434.212	So we know that our beliefs
434.212	and expectations can be manipulated,
437.298	which is why we do trials
437.298	where we control against a placebo,
441.37	where one half of the people
441.37	get the real treatment,
443.932	and the other half get placebo.
445.633	But that's not enough.
448.496	What I've just shown you are examples
450.296	of the very simple
450.296	and straightforward ways
452.492	that journalists and food supplement
452.492	pill peddlers and naturopaths
455.779	can distort evidence
455.779	for their own purposes.
458.26	What I find really fascinating
460.464	is that the pharmaceutical industry
460.464	uses exactly the same kinds
463.645	of tricks and devices,
465.197	but slightly more sophisticated
465.197	versions of them,
467.988	in order to distort the evidence
467.988	they give to doctors and patients,
471.19	and which we use to make
471.19	vitally important decisions.
473.776	So firstly, trials against placebo:
476.333	everybody thinks a trial
476.333	should be a comparison
478.729	of your new drug against placebo.
480.348	But in a lot of situations that's wrong;
482.292	often, we already have a good treatment
482.292	currently available.
485.214	So we don't want to know
485.214	that your alternative new treatment
488.071	is better than nothing,
489.246	but that it's better than the best
489.246	available treatment we have.
492.238	And yet, repeatedly, you consistently
492.238	see people doing trials
495.135	still against placebo.
496.465	And you can get licensed
496.465	to bring your drug to market
498.996	with only data showing
498.996	that it's better than nothing,
501.519	which is useless for a doctor like me
501.519	trying to make a decision.
504.545	But that's not the only way
504.545	you can rig your data.
506.934	You can also rig your data
508.206	by making the thing you compare
508.206	your new drug against
510.723	really rubbish.
511.904	You can give the competing drug
511.904	in too low a dose,
514.397	so people aren't properly treated.
516.054	You can give the competing drug
516.054	in too high a dose,
518.475	so people get side effects.
519.795	And this is exactly what happened
521.499	with antipsychotic medication
521.499	for schizophrenia.
523.988	Twenty years ago, a new generation
523.988	of antipsychotic drugs were brought in;
527.544	the promise was they would have
527.544	fewer side effects.
530.125	So people set about doing trials
530.125	of the new drugs against the old drugs.
533.603	But they gave the old drugs
533.603	in ridiculously high doses:
538.181	And it's a foregone conclusion
538.181	if you give a drug at that high a dose,
541.759	it will have more side effects,
541.759	and your new drug will look better.
545.063	Ten years ago, history repeated itself,
547.075	when risperidone, the first
547.075	of the new-generation antipsychotic drugs,
550.424	came off copyright,
550.424	so anybody could make copies.
552.79	Everybody wanted to show their drug
552.79	was better than risperidone,
555.846	so you see trials comparing
555.846	new antipsychotic drugs
558.271	against risperidone
558.271	at eight milligrams a day.
560.462	Again, not an insane dose,
560.462	not an illegal dose,
562.7	but very much at the high end of normal.
564.642	So you're bound to make
564.642	your new drug look better.
567.183	And so it's no surprise that overall,
569.804	industry-funded trials
569.804	are four times more likely
572.597	to give a positive result
573.95	than independently sponsored trials.
576.989	But -- and it's a big but --
579.657	(Laughter)
582.202	it turns out,
583.507	when you look at the methods
583.507	used by industry-funded trials,
587.172	that they're actually better
587.172	than independently sponsored trials.
590.882	And yet, they always manage
590.882	to get the result that they want.
593.798	So how does this work?
594.972	(Laughter)
596.009	How can we explain
596.009	this strange phenomenon?
598.8	Well, it turns out that what happens
600.622	is the negative data
600.622	goes missing in action;
602.879	it's withheld from doctors and patients.
604.84	And this is the most important
604.84	aspect of the whole story.
607.562	It's at the top
607.562	of the pyramid of evidence.
609.62	We need to have all of the data
609.62	on a particular treatment
612.33	to know whether or not
612.33	it really is effective.
614.514	There are two different ways you can spot
614.514	whether some data has gone missing.
618.205	You can use statistics
618.205	or you can use stories.
620.428	I prefer statistics,
620.428	so that's what I'll do first.
622.841	This is a funnel plot.
624.187	A funnel plot is a very clever
624.187	way of spotting
626.402	if small negative trials have disappeared,
626.402	have gone missing in action.
629.791	This is a graph of all of the trials done
629.791	on a particular treatment.
633.293	As you go up towards the top of the graph,
635.572	what you see is each dot is a trial.
637.525	As you go up, those are bigger trials,
637.525	so they've got less error;
640.675	they're less likely to be randomly false
640.675	positives or negatives.
643.845	So they all cluster together.
645.261	The big trials are closer
645.261	to the true answer.
647.792	Then as you go further down at the bottom,
649.832	what you can see is, on this side,
649.832	spurious false negatives,
652.775	and over on this side,
652.775	spurious false positives.
655.045	If there is publication bias,
657.145	if small negative trials
657.145	have gone missing in action,
659.699	you can see it on one of these graphs.
661.538	So you see here
661.538	that the small negative trials
663.713	that should be on the bottom left
663.713	have disappeared.
666.19	This is a graph demonstrating
666.19	the presence of publication bias
669.149	in studies of publication bias.
671.093	And I think that's the funniest
671.093	epidemiology joke you will ever hear.
674.419	(Laughter)
675.454	That's how you can prove it statistically.
677.502	But what about stories?
678.677	Well, they're heinous, they really are.
680.616	This is a drug called reboxetine.
682.229	This is a drug which I, myself,
682.229	have prescribed to patients.
685.192	And I'm a very nerdy doctor.
686.552	I hope I go out of my way
687.888	to try and read and understand
687.888	all the literature.
690.271	I read the trials on this.
691.603	They were all positive,
691.603	all well-conducted.
693.894	I found no flaw.
695.069	Unfortunately, it turned out,
695.069	that many of these trials were withheld.
698.674	In fact, 76 percent of all of the trials
698.674	that were done on this drug
703.243	were withheld from doctors and patients.
705.218	Now if you think about it,
706.495	if I tossed a coin a hundred times,
708.816	and I'm allowed to withhold from you
708.816	the answers half the times,
712.376	then I can convince you
712.376	that I have a coin with two heads.
716.489	If we remove half of the data,
718.426	we can never know what the true
718.426	effect size of these medicines is.
722.188	And this is not an isolated story.
724.283	Around half of all of the trial data
724.283	on antidepressants has been withheld,
728.101	but it goes way beyond that.
729.561	The Nordic Cochrane Group were trying
729.561	to get ahold of the data on that
732.931	to bring it all together.
734.15	The Cochrane Groups are an international
734.15	nonprofit collaboration
737.193	that produce systematic reviews
738.707	of all of the data
738.707	that has ever been shown.
740.828	And they need to have access
740.828	to all of the trial data.
743.386	But the companies withheld
743.386	that data from them.
745.853	So did the European Medicines Agency --
748.072	for three years.
749.682	This is a problem that is currently
749.682	lacking a solution.
752.738	And to show how big it goes,
752.738	this is a drug called Tamiflu,
755.661	which governments around the world
757.347	have spent billions
757.347	and billions of dollars on.
760.214	And they spend that money
760.214	on the promise that this is a drug
763.105	which will reduce the rate
763.105	of complications with flu.
766.101	We already have the data
767.276	showing it reduces the duration
767.276	of your flu by a few hours.
770.094	But I don't care about that,
770.094	governments don't care.
772.572	I'm sorry if you have the flu,
772.572	I know it's horrible,
775.05	but we're not going to spend
775.05	billions of dollars
777.318	trying to reduce the duration
777.318	of your flu symptoms by half a day.
780.504	We prescribe these drugs.
781.853	We stockpile them for emergencies
783.68	on the understanding they'll reduce
783.68	the number of complications,
786.793	which means pneumonia and death.
788.351	The infectious diseases Cochrane Group,
788.351	which are based in Italy,
791.834	has been trying to get
791.834	the full data in a usable form
795.035	out of the drug companies,
796.327	so they can make a full decision
798.442	about whether this drug
798.442	is effective or not,
800.563	and they've not been able
800.563	to get that information.
803.553	This is undoubtedly
803.553	the single biggest ethical problem
808.783	facing medicine today.
811.204	We cannot make decisions
811.204	in the absence of all of the information.
817.789	So it's a little bit difficult from there
820.79	to spin in some kind
820.79	of positive conclusion.
825.196	But I would say this:
828.931	I think that sunlight
831.751	is the best disinfectant.
834.077	All of these things
834.077	are happening in plain sight,
836.836	and they're all protected
836.836	by a force field of tediousness.
841.631	And I think, with all
841.631	of the problems in science,
844.062	one of the best things that we can do
845.906	is to lift up the lid,
845.906	finger around at the mechanics
848.733	and peer in.
850.036	Thank you very much.
851.22	(Applause)
