12.892	"""Don't talk to strangers."""
16.18	You have heard that phrase uttered
18.219	by your friends, family, schools and the media for decades.
22.532	It's a norm. It's a social norm.
25.444	But it's a special kind of social norm,
27.802	because it's a social norm that wants to tell us
30.332	who we can relate to and who we shouldn't relate to.
34.796	"""Don't talk to strangers"" says,"
37.3	"""Stay from anyone who's not familiar to you."
41.476	Stick with the people you know.
43.891	"Stick with people like you."""
46.865	How appealing is that?
49.217	It's not really what we do, is it, when we're at our best?
52.442	When we're at our best, we reach out to people
55.226	who are not like us,
56.844	because when we do that, we learn from people
59.711	who are not like us.
61.98	"My phrase for this value of being with ""not like us"""
66.081	"is ""strangeness,"""
67.953	and my point is that in today's digitally intensive world,
71.853	strangers are quite frankly not the point.
75.219	The point that we should be worried about is,
77.402	how much strangeness are we getting?
80.289	Why strangeness? Because our social relations
83.295	are increasingly mediated by data,
86.089	and data turns our social relations into digital relations,
90.646	and that means that our digital relations
92.995	now depend extraordinarily on technology
96.797	to bring to them a sense of robustness,
99.715	a sense of discovery,
101.302	a sense of surprise and unpredictability.
104.572	Why not strangers?
106.339	Because strangers are part of a world
108.633	of really rigid boundaries.
110.898	They belong to a world of people I know
113.85	versus people I don't know,
116.364	and in the context of my digital relations,
118.843	I'm already doing things with people I don't know.
122.864	The question isn't whether or not I know you.
126.082	The question is, what can I do with you?
128.586	What can I learn with you?
131.195	What can we do together that benefits us both?
135.496	I spend a lot of time thinking about
137.858	how the social landscape is changing,
140.618	how new technologies create new constraints
143.09	and new opportunities for people.
145.88	The most important changes facing us today
148.531	have to do with data and what data is doing
151.337	to shape the kinds of digital relations
153.442	that will be possible for us in the future.
155.906	The economies of the future depend on that.
158.139	Our social lives in the future depend on that.
161.058	The threat to worry about isn't strangers.
164.09	The threat to worry about is whether or not
166.202	we're getting our fair share of strangeness.
169.194	Now, 20th-century psychologists and sociologists
171.786	were thinking about strangers,
173.939	but they weren't thinking so dynamically about human relations,
176.676	and they were thinking about strangers
178.045	in the context of influencing practices.
180.999	Stanley Milgram from the '60s and '70s,
183.747	the creator of the small-world experiments,
185.733	which became later popularized as six degrees of separation,
188.687	made the point that any two arbitrarily selected people
192.199	were likely connected from between five to seven intermediary steps.
195.921	His point was that strangers are out there.
198.951	We can reach them. There are paths
200.523	that enable us to reach them.
203.209	Mark Granovetter, Stanford sociologist, in 1973
206.978	"in his seminal essay ""The Strength of Weak Ties,"""
209.776	made the point that these weak ties
212.602	that are a part of our networks, these strangers,
215.089	are actually more effective at diffusing information to us
218.081	than are our strong ties, the people closest to us.
222.617	He makes an additional indictment of our strong ties
226.114	when he says that these people who are so close to us,
228.743	these strong ties in our lives,
230.676	actually have a homogenizing effect on us.
234.103	They produce sameness.
236.938	My colleagues and I at Intel have spent the last few years
239.777	looking at the ways in which digital platforms
242.393	are reshaping our everyday lives,
244.264	what kinds of new routines are possible.
246.881	We've been looking specifically at the kinds
248.177	of digital platforms that have enabled us
250.888	to take our possessions, those things that used to be
254.023	very restricted to us and to our friends in our houses,
257.145	and to make them available to people we don't know.
260.967	Whether it's our clothes, whether it's our cars,
263.69	whether it's our bikes, whether it's our books or music,
266.313	we are able to take our possessions now
269.306	and make them available to people we've never met.
272.737	And we concluded a very important insight,
275.548	which was that as people's relationships
277.336	to the things in their lives change,
279.877	so do their relations with other people.
283.321	And yet recommendation system
284.729	after recommendation system continues to miss the boat.
289.004	It continues to try to predict what I need
291.553	based on some past characterization of who I am,
294.793	of what I've already done.
297.089	Security technology after security technology
299.593	continues to design data protection
301.769	in terms of threats and attacks,
304.174	keeping me locked into really rigid kinds of relations.
307.769	"Categories like ""friends"" and ""family"""
310.265	"and ""contacts"" and ""colleagues"""
312.742	don't tell me anything about my actual relations.
316.529	A more effective way to think about my relations
318.773	might be in terms of closeness and distance,
321.465	where at any given point in time, with any single person,
325.285	I am both close and distant from that individual,
328.776	all as a function of what I need to do right now.
333.284	People aren't close or distant.
335.922	People are always a combination of the two,
338.983	and that combination is constantly changing.
342.703	What if technologies could intervene
345.143	to disrupt the balance of certain kinds of relationships?
349.12	What if technologies could intervene
351.081	to help me find the person that I need right now?
355.492	Strangeness is that calibration
357.916	of closeness and distance
360.135	that enables me to find the people that I need right now,
364.038	that enables me to find the sources of intimacy,
367.028	of discovery, and of inspiration that I need right now.
371.676	Strangeness is not about meeting strangers.
373.985	It simply makes the point that we need
376.18	to disrupt our zones of familiarity.
379.462	So jogging those zones of familiarity is one way to think about strangeness,
383.119	and it's a problem faced not just by individuals today,
385.823	but also by organizations,
388.053	organizations that are trying to embrace massively new opportunities.
392.576	Whether you're a political party
394.682	insisting to your detriment on a very rigid notion
397.55	of who belongs and who does not,
399.938	whether you're the government
401.431	protecting social institutions like marriage
404.129	and restricting access of those institutions to the few,
408.022	whether you're a teenager in her bedroom
410.43	who's trying to jostle her relations with her parents,
413.618	strangeness is a way to think about how we pave the way
416.78	to new kinds of relations.
419.254	We have to change the norms.
422.612	We have to change the norms in order to enable
425.642	new kinds of technologies
427.58	as a basis for new kinds of businesses.
430.369	What interesting questions lie ahead for us
434.102	in this world of no strangers?
436.773	How might we think differently about our relations with people?
440.579	How might we think differently about our relations
443.7	with distributed groups of people?
445.792	How might we think differently about our relations with technologies,
450.233	things that effectively become social participants
453.239	in their own right?
455.313	The range of digital relations is extraordinary.
459.126	In the context of this broad range of digital relations,
463.683	safely seeking strangeness might very well be
466.657	a new basis for that innovation.
468.928	Thank you.
470.398	(Applause)
