15.682	You know, my favorite part of being a dad
18.212	is the movies I get to watch.
21.471	I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids,
23.352	and when my daughter was four,
25.948	"we got to watch ""The Wizard of Oz"" together."
28.838	It totally dominated her imagination for months.
32.237	Her favorite character was Glinda, of course.
35.455	It gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress
37.515	and carry a wand.
39.169	But you watch that movie enough times,
41.578	and you start to realize how unusual it is.
43.011	Now we live today, and are raising our children,
45.863	in a kind of children's-fantasy-spectacular-industrial complex.
52.213	"But ""The Wizard of Oz"" stood alone."
53.958	It did not start that trend.
56.145	Forty years later was when the trend really caught on,
59.567	with, interestingly, another movie
61.916	that featured a metal guy
64.051	and a furry guy
65.435	rescuing a girl by dressing up as the enemy's guards.
70.646	Do you know what I'm talking about? (Laughter)
73.087	Yeah.
74.562	Now, there's a big difference between these two movies,
78.285	"a couple of really big differences between ""The Wizard of Oz"""
80.322	and all the movies we watch today.
81.255	"One is there's very little violence in ""The Wizard of Oz."""
84.56	The monkeys are rather aggressive, as are the apple trees.
89.805	"But I think if ""The Wizard of Oz"" were made today,"
93.412	"the wizard would say, ""Dorothy, you are the savior of Oz"
97.838	that the prophecy foretold.
99.6	Use your magic slippers to defeat
101.674	"the computer-generated armies of the Wicked Witch."""
105.287	But that's not how it happens.
106.939	"Another thing that's really unique about ""The Wizard of Oz"""
109.341	to me is that all of the most heroic
112.644	and wise and even villainous characters
115.974	are female.
119.486	Now I started to notice this
121.6	"when I actually showed ""Star Wars"" to my daughter,"
124.745	which was years later, and the situation was different.
127.281	At that point I also had a son.
130.42	He was only three at the time.
132.147	He was not invited to the screening. He was too young for that.
136.293	But he was the second child,
137.614	and the level of supervision had plummeted. (Laughter)
141.387	So he wandered in,
145.001	and it imprinted on him
149.03	like a mommy duck does to its duckling,
154.672	and I don't think he understands what's going on,
158.451	but he is sure soaking in it.
161.978	And I wonder what he's soaking in.
163.347	Is he picking up on the themes of courage
165.825	and perseverance and loyalty?
167.942	Is he picking up on the fact that Luke
170.922	joins an army to overthrow the government?
175.816	Is he picking up on the fact that
177.472	there are only boys in the universe
180.575	except for Aunt Beru, and of course this princess,
183.764	who's really cool, but who kind of waits around through most of the movie
188.214	so that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink
191.443	to thank him for saving the universe, which he does
193.996	by the magic that he was born with?
197.222	"Compare this to 1939 with ""The Wizard of Oz."""
200.188	How does Dorothy win her movie?
202.817	By making friends with everybody
205.767	and being a leader.
207.544	That's kind of the world I'd rather raise my kids in --
210.85	Oz, right? -- and not the world of dudes fighting,
214.74	which is where we kind of have to be.
216.643	Why is there so much Force -- capital F, Force --
220.423	in the movies we have for our kids,
222.11	and so little yellow brick road?
224.555	There is a lot of great writing about the impact
227.972	that the boy-violent movie has on girls,
232.219	and you should do that reading. It's very good.
234.837	I haven't read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe.
239.711	I know from my own experience that
242.261	Princess Leia did not provide the adequate context
247.886	that I could have used in navigating the adult world
252.015	that is co-ed. (Laughter)
256.616	I think there was a first-kiss moment
259.806	when I really expected the credits to start rolling
263.137	because that's the end of the movie, right?
265.94	I finished my quest, I got the girl.
268.237	Why are you still standing there?
271.368	I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
272.813	The movies are very, very focused on defeating the villain
276.001	and getting your reward, and there's not a lot of room
278.589	for other relationships and other journeys.
281.48	It's almost as though if you're a boy,
283.719	you are a dopey animal,
285.8	and if you are a girl, you should bring your warrior costume.
290.274	There are plenty of exceptions,
292.462	and I will defend the Disney princesses in front of any you.
297.759	But they do send a message to boys,
300.811	that they are not, the boys are not really the target audience.
303.317	They are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls
305.759	how to defend against the patriarchy,
309.131	but they are not necessarily showing boys
311.096	how they're supposed to defend against the patriarchy.
313.93	There's no models for them.
316.07	And we also have some terrific women
319.343	who are writing new stories for our kids,
321.48	and as three-dimensional and delightful as Hermione and Katniss are,
326.222	these are still war movies.
328.348	And, of course, the most successful studio of all time
332.456	continues to crank out classic after classic,
336.586	every single one of them about
339.33	the journey of a boy, or a man,
343.1	or two men who are friends, or a man and his son,
346.744	or two men who are raising a little girl.
350.339	Until, as many of you are thinking, this year,
354.079	"when they finally came out with ""Brave."""
355.805	I recommend it to all of you. It's on demand now.
359.812	"Do you remember what the critics said when ""Brave"" came out?"
363.706	"""Aw, I can't believe Pixar made a princess movie."""
368.114	It's very good. Don't let that stop you.
370.235	Now, almost none of these movies pass the Bechdel Test.
374.127	I don't know if you've heard of this.
375.313	It has not yet caught on and caught fire,
378.135	but maybe today we will start a movement.
380.216	Alison Bechdel is a comic book artist,
382.998	and back in the mid-'80s, she recorded this conversation
388.104	she'd had with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw.
391.678	And it's very simple. There's just three questions you should ask:
394.664	Is there more than one character in the movie
397.174	that is female who has lines?
400.775	So try to meet that bar.
403.355	And do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie?
409.015	And is their conversation about something other than
412.468	the guy that they both like? (Laughter)
415.784	Right? Thank you. (Applause)
420.116	Thank you very much.
421.941	Two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff.
429.544	It does happen. I've seen it,
434.674	and yet I very rarely see it in the movies
437.622	that we know and love.
438.789	In fact, this week I went to see
440.949	"a very high-quality movie, ""Argo."""
444.563	Right? Oscar buzz, doing great at the box office,
448.222	a consensus idea of what a quality Hollywood film is.
452.506	It pretty much flunks the Bechdel test.
455.19	And I don't think it should, because a lot of the movie,
458.997	I don't know if you've seen it, but a lot of the movie
460.578	takes place in this embassy where men and women
464.036	are hiding out during the hostage crisis.
466.713	We've got quite a few scenes of the men
468.602	having deep, angst-ridden conversations in this hideout,
472.763	and the great moment for one of the actresses is
476.779	"to peek through the door and say, ""Are you coming to bed, honey?"""
481.901	That's Hollywood for you.
483.902	So let's look at the numbers.
489.909	how many of them do you think actually have female protagonists?
494.154	Eleven. It's not bad.
497.448	It's not as many percent as the number of women
501.143	we've just elected to Congress, so that's good.
504.269	But there is a number that is greater than this
507.273	that's going to bring this room down.
509.93	Last year, The New York Times published a study
513.592	that the government had done.
515.251	Here's what it said.
516.639	One out of five women in America
520.855	say that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life.
527.108	Now, I don't think that's the fault of popular entertainment.
530.892	I don't think kids' movies have anything to do with that.
535.175	I don't even think that
536.953	music videos or pornography are really directly related to that,
540.508	but something is going wrong,
543.273	and when I hear that statistic,
546.324	one of the things I think of is
548.829	that's a lot of sexual assailants.
552.954	Who are these guys? What are they learning?
556.314	What are they failing to learn?
558.03	Are they absorbing the story that
560.18	a male hero's job is to defeat the villain with violence
564.707	and then collect the reward, which is a woman
567.24	who has no friends and doesn't speak?
572.288	Are we soaking up that story?
577.493	You know,
579.839	as a parent with the privilege
582.606	of raising a daughter
585.25	like all of you who are doing the same thing,
588.119	we find this world and this statistic very alarming
591.899	and we want to prepare them.
593.036	"We have tools at our disposal like ""girl power,"""
597.322	and we hope that that will help,
600.056	but I gotta wonder, is girl power going to protect them
603.665	if, at the same time, actively or passively,
606.263	we are training our sons to maintain their boy power?
611.216	I mean, I think the Netflix queue
614.614	is one way that we can do something very important,
617.87	and I'm talking mainly to the dads here.
620.925	I think we have got to show our sons
623.775	a new definition of manhood.
625.631	The definition of manhood is already turning upside down.
630.151	You've read about how the new economy
632.282	is changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner.
635.683	They're throwing it up in the air.
637.337	So our sons are going to have to find some way
639.955	of adapting to this, some new relationship with each other,
642.93	and I think we really have to show them, and model for them,
646.777	how a real man
650.478	is someone who trusts his sisters
654.247	and respects them, and wants to be on their team,
657.42	and stands up against the real bad guys,
661.043	who are the men who want to abuse the women.
664.899	And I think our job in the Netflix queue
667.95	is to look out for those movies that pass the Bechdel Test,
671.719	if we can find them, and to seek out the heroines
676	who are there,
677.586	who show real courage, who bring people together,
681.375	and to nudge our sons to identify with those heroines
684.963	"and to say, ""I want to be on their team,"""
688.448	because they're going to be on their team.
693.03	"When I asked my daughter who her favorite character was in ""Star Wars,"""
696.724	do you know what she said?
698.753	Obi-Wan.
701.256	Obi-Wan Kenobi and Glinda.
705.153	What do these two have in common?
708.62	Maybe it's not just the sparkly dress.
710.544	I think these people are experts.
714.171	I think these are the two people in the movie
715.697	who know more than anybody else,
717.265	and they love sharing their knowledge with other people
720.592	to help them reach their potential.
723.696	Now, they are leaders.
725.704	I like that kind of quest for my daughter,
727.922	and I like that kind of quest for my son.
730.109	I want more quests like that.
732.02	I want fewer quests where my son is told,
734.62	"""Go out and fight it alone,"""
736.831	and more quests where he sees that it's his job to join a team,
742.036	maybe a team led by women,
746.136	to help other people become better
751.756	and be better people,
754.148	like the Wizard of Oz.
756.43	Thank you.
