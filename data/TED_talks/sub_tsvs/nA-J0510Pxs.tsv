13.01	Well, Arthur C. Clarke,
14.31	a famous science fiction
14.31	writer from the 1950s,
17.505	"said that, ""We overestimate"
17.505	technology in the short term,
21.527	"and we underestimate it in the long term."""
24.327	And I think that's some of the fear
24.327	that we see
26.744	about jobs disappearing from artificial
26.744	intelligence and robots.
31.326	That we're overestimating
31.326	the technology in the short term.
34.16	But I am worried whether we're going to get
34.16	the technology we need in the long term.
39.371	Because the demographics are really going
39.371	to leave us with lots of jobs that need doing
45.085	and that we, our society, is going to have to be built
45.085	on the shoulders of steel of robots in the future.
50.46	So I'm scared we won't have enough robots.
53.286	But fear of losing jobs to technology
53.286	has been around for a long time.
57.925	Back in 1957, there was a Spencer
57.925	Tracy, Katharine Hepburn movie.
61.877	So you know how it ended up,
63.325	Spencer Tracy brought a computer,
63.325	a mainframe computer of 1957, in
67.411	to help the librarians.
69.311	The librarians in the company would do
69.311	things like answer for the executives,
73.002	"""What are the names of Santa's reindeer?"""
76.625	And they would look that up.
77.983	And this mainframe computer was going
77.983	to help them with that job.
80.416	Well of course a mainframe computer
80.416	in 1957 wasn't much use for that job.
84.326	The librarians were afraid
84.326	their jobs were going to disappear.
87.476	But that's not what happened in fact.
89.262	The number of jobs for librarians
89.262	increased for a long time after 1957.
94.38	It wasn't until the Internet
94.38	came into play,
97.494	the web came into play and search
97.494	engines came into play
100.185	that the need for librarians went down.
102.676	And I think everyone from 1957
102.676	totally underestimated
106.883	the level of technology we would all carry
106.883	around in our hands and in our pockets today.
111.643	"And we can just ask: ""What are the names"
111.643	"of Santa's reindeer?"" and be told instantly --"
117.36	or anything else we want to ask.
119.111	By the way, the wages
119.111	for librarians went up faster
124.71	than the wages for other jobs in the U.S.
124.71	over that same time period,
128.02	because librarians became
128.02	partners of computers.
131.277	Computers became tools, and they got
131.277	more tools that they could use
134.16	and become more effective
134.16	during that time.
136.452	Same thing happened in offices.
138.244	Back in the old days,
138.244	people used spreadsheets.
140.542	Spreadsheets were spread sheets of paper,
142.876	and they calculated by hand.
145.026	But here was an interesting
145.026	thing that came along.
147.431	With the revolution around 1980 of P.C.'s,
149.683	the spreadsheet programs were
149.683	tuned for office workers,
154.425	not to replace office workers,
156.077	but it respected office workers
156.077	as being capable of being programmers.
160.743	So office workers became
160.743	programmers of spreadsheets.
163.871	It increased their capabilities.
165.962	They no longer had to do
165.962	the mundane computations,
168.541	but they could do something much more.
171.476	Now today, we're starting
171.476	to see robots in our lives.
174.734	On the left there
174.734	is the PackBot from iRobot.
177.043	When soldiers came across roadside
177.043	bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan,
180.475	instead of putting on a bomb suit
180.475	and going out and poking with a stick,
184.624	as they used to do up until about 2002,
186.943	they now send the robot out.
188.351	So the robot takes
188.351	over the dangerous jobs.
190.494	On the right are some TUGs from a company
190.494	called Aethon in Pittsburgh.
195.012	These are in hundreds
195.012	of hospitals across the U.S.
197.417	And they take the dirty
197.417	sheets down to the laundry.
200.049	They take the dirty dishes
200.049	back to the kitchen.
201.925	They bring the medicines
201.925	up from the pharmacy.
204.14	And it frees up the nurses
204.14	and the nurse's aides
206.955	from doing that mundane work of just
206.955	mechanically pushing stuff around
210.62	to spend more time with patients.
212.693	In fact, robots have become sort
212.693	of ubiquitous in our lives in many ways.
217.392	But I think when it comes to factory
217.392	robots, people are sort of afraid,
222.66	because factory robots
222.66	are dangerous to be around.
226.767	In order to program them, you have to understand
226.767	six-dimensional vectors and quaternions.
231.592	And ordinary people can't
231.592	interact with them.
234.742	And I think it's the sort
234.742	of technology that's gone wrong.
237.528	It's displaced the worker
237.528	from the technology.
240.994	And I think we really have
240.994	to look at technologies
244.093	that ordinary workers can interact with.
246.195	And so I want to tell you today about Baxter,
246.195	which we've been talking about.
249.886	And Baxter, I see, as a way
249.886	-- a first wave of robot
254.12	that ordinary people can interact
254.12	with in an industrial setting.
258.41	So Baxter is up here.
259.943	This is Chris Harbert
259.943	from Rethink Robotics.
262.759	We've got a conveyor there.
264.295	And if the lighting isn't too extreme --
267.146	Ah, ah! There it is. It's picked
267.146	up the object off the conveyor.
271.192	It's going to come bring it
271.192	over here and put it down.
274.041	And then it'll go back,
274.041	reach for another object.
277.341	The interesting thing is Baxter
277.341	has some basic common sense.
281.189	By the way, what's going on with the eyes?
283.41	The eyes are on the screen there.
285.006	The eyes look ahead where
285.006	the robot's going to move.
287.659	So a person that's interacting
287.659	with the robot
289.826	understands where it's going to reach
289.826	and isn't surprised by its motions.
293.392	Here Chris took the object
293.392	out of its hand,
295.91	and Baxter didn't go
295.91	and try to put it down;
298.142	it went back and realized
298.142	it had to get another one.
300.494	It's got a little bit of basic common
300.494	sense, goes and picks the objects.
303.661	And Baxter's safe to interact with.
305.454	You wouldn't want to do this
305.454	with a current industrial robot.
308.383	But with Baxter it doesn't hurt.
310.411	It feels the force, understands
310.411	that Chris is there
314.309	and doesn't push through him and hurt him.
317.161	But I think the most interesting thing
317.161	about Baxter is the user interface.
320.709	And so Chris is going to come
320.709	and grab the other arm now.
323.802	And when he grabs an arm, it goes
323.802	into zero-force gravity-compensated mode
329.216	and graphics come up on the screen.
331.292	You can see some icons on the left of the screen
331.292	there for what was about its right arm.
335.826	He's going to put something in its hand,
335.826	he's going to bring it over here,
339.374	press a button and let go
339.374	of that thing in the hand.
343.642	And the robot figures out, ah, he must
343.642	mean I want to put stuff down.
348.21	It puts a little icon there.
349.91	He comes over here, and he gets
349.91	the fingers to grasp together,
355.821	and the robot infers, ah, you
355.821	want an object for me to pick up.
359.743	That puts the green icon there.
361.542	He's going to map out an area of where
361.542	the robot should pick up the object from.
366.537	It just moves it around, and the robot
366.537	figures out that was an area search.
371.327	He didn't have to select that from a menu.
373.351	And now he's going to go off and train
373.351	the visual appearance of that object
376.947	while we continue talking.
378.515	So as we continue here,
380.288	I want to tell you about what this
380.288	is like in factories.
382.459	These robots we're shipping every day.
383.943	They go to factories around the country.
385.872	This is Mildred.
386.675	Mildred's a factory worker in Connecticut.
388.699	She's worked on the line
388.699	for over 20 years.
391.078	One hour after she saw her
391.078	first industrial robot,
393.963	she had programmed it to do
393.963	some tasks in the factory.
397.023	She decided she really liked robots.
399.454	And it was doing the simple repetitive
399.454	tasks that she had had to do beforehand.
404.124	Now she's got the robot doing it.
405.962	When we first went out to talk
405.962	to people in factories
408.526	about how we could get robots
408.526	to interact with them better,
411.36	one of the questions we asked them was,
413.242	"""Do you want your children"
413.242	"to work in a factory?"""
415.687	"The universal answer was ""No, I want"
415.687	"a better job than that for my children."""
419.743	And as a result of that,
419.743	Mildred is very typical
423.12	of today's factory workers in the U.S.
424.975	They're older, and they're
424.975	getting older and older.
427.428	There aren't many young people
427.428	coming into factory work.
430.119	And as their tasks become
430.119	more onerous on them,
433.041	we need to give them tools
433.041	that they can collaborate with,
436.134	so that they can be part of the solution,
438.111	so that they can continue to work
438.111	and we can continue to produce in the U.S.
442.795	And so our vision is that Mildred
442.795	who's the line worker
446.86	becomes Mildred the robot trainer.
449.777	She lifts her game,
450.922	like the office workers of the 1980s
450.922	lifted their game of what they could do.
455.509	We're not giving them tools that they have to go
455.509	and study for years and years in order to use.
460.057	They're tools that they can just learn
460.057	how to operate in a few minutes.
463.501	There's two great forces
463.501	that are both volitional but inevitable.
467.826	That's climate change and demographics.
470.203	Demographics is really
470.203	going to change our world.
472.87	This is the percentage
472.87	of adults who are working age.
476.832	And it's gone down slightly
476.832	over the last 40 years.
479.285	But over the next 40 years, it's going
479.285	to change dramatically, even in China.
483.165	The percentage of adults who are working
483.165	age drops dramatically.
488.002	And turned up the other way, the people
488.002	who are retirement age goes up very, very fast,
493.092	as the baby boomers get to retirement age.
497.429	That means there will be more people
497.429	with fewer social security dollars
500.977	competing for services.
503.61	But more than that, as we get
503.61	older we get more frail
507.661	and we can't do all the tasks
507.661	we used to do.
509.91	If we look at the statistics
509.91	on the ages of caregivers,
513.623	before our eyes those caregivers
513.623	are getting older and older.
518.093	That's happening statistically right now.
520.092	And as the number of people who are older,
520.092	above retirement age and getting older, as they increase,
526.03	there will be less people
526.03	to take care of them.
528.293	And I think we're really going
528.293	to have to have robots to help us.
531.413	And I don't mean robots
531.413	in terms of companions.
533.91	I mean robots doing the things
533.91	that we normally do for ourselves
537.192	but get harder as we get older.
538.861	Getting the groceries in from the car,
538.861	up the stairs, into the kitchen.
542.266	Or even, as we get very much older,
544.121	driving our cars to go visit people.
547.209	And I think robotics gives people a chance
547.209	to have dignity as they get older
553.576	by having control of the robotic solution.
557.125	So they don't have to rely on people
557.125	that are getting scarcer to help them.
560.721	And so I really think that we're
560.721	going to be spending more time
567.402	with robots like Baxter
569.703	and working with robots like Baxter
569.703	in our daily lives. And that we will --
576.397	Here, Baxter, it's good.
578.877	And that we will all come to rely
578.877	on robots over the next 40 years
583.121	as part of our everyday lives.
585.287	Thanks very much.
586.581	(Applause)
