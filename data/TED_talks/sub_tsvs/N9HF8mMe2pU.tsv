12.76	I want to share with you
12.76	something my father taught me:
17.141	no condition is permanent.
21.103	It's a lesson he shared with me
21.103	again and again,
24.011	and I learned it to be true the hard way.
28.41	Here I am in my fourth-grade class.
31.351	This is my yearbook picture
31.351	taken in my class in school
35.109	in Monrovia, Liberia.
37.334	My parents migrated from India
37.334	to West Africa in the 1970s,
41.759	and I had the privilege
41.759	of growing up there.
45.592	I was nine years old,
46.766	I loved kicking around a soccer ball,
48.552	and I was a total math and science geek.
50.823	I was living the kind of life
50.823	that, really, any child would dream of.
57.1	But no condition is permanent.
60.166	On Christmas Eve in 1989,
63.113	civil war erupted in Liberia.
66.902	The war started in the rural countryside,
68.88	and within months, rebel armies
68.88	had marched towards our hometown.
72.611	My school shut down,
74.305	and when the rebel armies captured
74.305	the only international airport,
77.801	people started panicking and fleeing.
81.57	My mom came knocking one morning
81.57	"and said, ""Raj, pack your things --"
84.952	"we have to go."""
86.815	We were rushed to the center of town,
89.068	and there on a tarmac,
89.068	we were split into two lines.
94.453	I stood with my family in one line,
96.97	and we were stuffed into the cargo hatch
99.394	of a rescue plane.
101.194	And there on a bench,
101.194	I was sitting with my heart racing.
104.105	As I looked out the open hatch,
106.548	I saw hundreds of Liberians
106.548	in another line,
109.411	children strapped to their backs.
112.334	When they tried to jump in with us,
115.204	I watched soldiers restrain them.
118.511	They were not allowed to flee.
120.997	We were the lucky ones.
123.165	We lost what we had,
124.945	but we resettled in America,
127.381	and as immigrants, we benefitted
127.381	from the community of supporters
130.536	that rallied around us.
133.752	They took my family into their home,
135.579	they mentored me.
137.916	And they helped my dad
137.916	start a clothing shop.
140.083	I'd visit my father
140.083	on weekends as a teenager
142.476	to help him sell sneakers and jeans.
144.954	And every time business would get bad,
147.311	he'd remind me of that mantra:
149.818	no condition is permanent.
152.613	That mantra and my parents' persistence
152.613	and that community of supporters
157.066	made it possible for me
157.066	to go through college
159.415	and eventually to medical school.
162.185	I'd once had my hopes crushed in a war,
165.857	but because of them,
167.149	I had a chance to pursue my dream
167.149	to become a doctor.
170.866	My condition had changed.
174.609	It had been 15 years
174.609	since I escaped that airfield,
177.27	but the memory of those two lines
177.27	had not escaped my mind.
180.063	I was a medical student in my mid-20s,
182.607	and I wanted to go back
183.865	to see if I could serve
183.865	the people we'd left behind.
187.605	But when I got back,
188.779	what I found was utter destruction.
190.63	The war had left us with just 51 doctors
192.775	to serve a country of four million people.
195.237	It would be like the city of San Francisco
195.237	having just 10 doctors.
199.229	So if you got sick in the city
199.229	where those few doctors remain,
202.328	you might stand a chance.
203.801	But if you got sick in the remote,
203.801	rural rainforest communities,
207.691	where you could be days
207.691	from the nearest clinic --
210.08	I was seeing my patients die
210.08	from conditions no one should die from,
213.845	all because they were
213.845	getting to me too late.
216.012	Imagine you have a two-year-old
216.012	who wakes up one morning with a fever,
219.458	and you realize she could have malaria,
221.886	and you know the only way to get her
221.886	the medicine she needs
224.911	would be to take her to the riverbed,
226.788	get in a canoe, paddle to the other side
228.887	and then walk for up to two days
228.887	through the forest
231.526	just to reach the nearest clinic.
233.977	One billion people live
233.977	in the world's most remote communities,
237.12	and despite the advances we've made
237.12	in modern medicine and technology,
240.789	our innovations are not
240.789	reaching the last mile.
243.512	These communities have been left behind,
245.497	because they've been thought
245.497	too hard to reach
247.72	and too difficult to serve.
250.102	Illness is universal;
251.813	access to care is not.
254.042	And realizing this lit a fire in my soul.
256.628	No one should die because they live
256.628	too far from a doctor or clinic.
260.91	No condition should be permanent.
265.181	And help in this case
265.181	didn't come from the outside,
267.848	it actually came from within.
269.525	It came from the communities themselves.
271.998	Meet Musu.
273.381	Way out in rural Liberia,
274.79	where most girls have not had
274.79	a chance to finish primary school,
278.983	Musu had been persistent.
281.913	At the age of 18,
281.913	she completed high school,
284.258	and she came back to her community.
286.558	She saw that none of the children
286.558	were getting treatment
289.254	for the diseases
289.254	they needed treatment for --
291.405	deadly diseases, like malaria
291.405	and pneumonia.
293.749	So she signed up to be a volunteer.
297.659	There are millions of volunteers like Musu
297.659	in rural parts around our world,
301.324	and we got to thinking --
303.121	community members like Musu
303.121	could actually help us solve a puzzle.
307.923	Our health care system
307.923	is structured in such a way
310.624	that the work of diagnosing disease
310.624	and prescribing medicines
314.356	is limited to a team of nurses
314.356	and doctors like me.
318.238	But nurses and doctors
318.238	are concentrated in cities,
320.907	so rural communities like Musu's
320.907	have been left behind.
324.722	So we started asking some questions:
326.501	What if we could reorganize
326.501	the medical care system?
329.058	What if we could have community
329.058	members like Musu
332	be a part or even be the center
332	of our medical team?
335.301	What if Musu could help us bring
335.301	health care from clinics in cities
339.25	to the doorsteps of her neighbors?
342.961	Musu was 48 when I met her.
345.836	And despite her amazing talent and grit,
348.913	she hadn't had a paying job in 30 years.
353.283	So what if technology could support her?
356.204	What if we could invest in her
356.204	with real training,
360.522	equip her with real medicines,
363.648	and have her have a real job?
368.224	Well, in 2007, I was trying
368.224	to answer these questions,
372.712	and my wife and I were
372.712	getting married that year.
375.92	We asked our relatives to forgo
375.92	the wedding registry gifts
380.437	and instead donate some money
382.011	so we could have some start-up money
382.011	to launch a nonprofit.
385.938	I promise you, I'm a lot
385.938	more romantic than that.
388.399	(Laughter)
389.983	We ended up raising $6,000,
392.4	teamed up with some
392.4	Liberians and Americans
394.552	and launched a nonprofit
394.552	called Last Mile Health.
397.314	Our goal is to bring a health worker
397.314	within reach of everyone, everywhere.
402.241	We designed a three-step process --
404.199	train, equip and pay --
405.687	to invest more deeply
405.687	in volunteers like Musu
409.068	to become paraprofessionals,
410.691	to become community health workers.
412.889	First we trained Musu to prevent,
412.889	diagnose and treat
417.47	the top 10 diseases afflicting
417.47	families in her village.
421.723	A nurse supervisor visited her
421.723	every month to coach her.
425.703	We equipped her with modern
425.703	medical technology,
428.268	like this $1 malaria rapid test,
431.662	and put it in a backpack
431.662	full of medicines like this
435.415	to treat infections like pneumonia,
438.41	and crucially,
440.001	a smartphone, to help her track
440.001	and report on epidemics.
445.16	Last, we recognized
445.16	the dignity in Musu's work.
448.281	With the Liberian government,
448.281	we created a contract,
450.738	paid her
452.048	and gave her the chance
452.048	to have a real job.
454.165	And she's amazing.
455.358	Musu has learned over 30 medical skills,
458.868	from screening children for malnutrition,
461.651	to assessing the cause
461.651	of a child's cough with a smartphone,
465.148	to supporting people with HIV
468.293	and providing follow-up care
468.293	to patients who've lost their limbs.
473.785	Working as part of our team,
475.894	working as paraprofessionals,
477.443	community health workers can help ensure
479.696	that a lot of what
479.696	your family doctor would do
482.017	reaches the places that most
482.017	family doctors could never go.
485.861	One of my favorite things to do
485.861	is to care for patients
488.826	with community health workers.
490.299	So last year I was visiting A.B.,
492.636	and like Musu, A.B. had had
492.636	a chance to go to school.
496.299	He was in middle school,
496.299	in the eighth grade,
499.4	when his parents died.
500.69	He became an orphan and had to drop out.
504.739	Last year, we hired and trained
504.739	A.B. as a community health worker.
510.035	And while he was making
510.035	door to door house calls,
512.925	he met this young boy named Prince,
515.172	whose mother had had trouble
515.172	breastfeeding him,
518.469	and by the age of six months,
518.469	Prince had started to waste away.
521.705	A.B. had just been taught how to use
521.705	this color-coded measuring tape
525.338	that wraps around the upper arm
525.338	of a child to diagnose malnutrition.
528.908	A.B. noticed that Prince
528.908	was in the red zone,
531.323	which meant he had to be hospitalized.
533.238	So A.B. took Prince
533.238	and his mother to the river,
535.904	got in a canoe
537.095	and paddled for four hours
537.095	to get to the hospital.
539.779	Later, after Prince was discharged,
542.802	A.B. taught mom how to feed baby
542.802	a food supplement.
547.683	A few months ago,
549.746	A.B. took me to visit Prince,
549.746	and he's a chubby little guy.
552.986	(Laughter)
554.141	He's meeting his milestones,
554.141	he's pulled himself up to a stand,
557.337	and is even starting to say a few words.
559.318	I'm so inspired by these
559.318	community health workers.
561.841	I often ask them why they do what they do,
564.153	and when I asked A.B.,
566.774	"he said, ""Doc, since I dropped out"
566.774	of school, this is the first time
570.773	I'm having a chance
570.773	to hold a pen to write.
573.856	"My brain is getting fresh."""
577.924	The stories of A.B. and Musu
577.924	have taught me something fundamental
581.626	about being human.
584.096	Our will to serve others
587.249	can actually help us
587.249	transform our own conditions.
591.532	I was so moved by how powerful
591.532	the will to serve our neighbors can be
595.65	a few years ago,
597.824	when we faced a global catastrophe.
600.48	In December 2013,
602.206	something happened in the rainforests
602.206	across the border from us in Guinea.
605.805	A toddler named Emile fell sick
605.805	with vomiting, fever and diarrhea.
610.429	He lived in an area
610.429	where the roads were sparse
612.762	and there had been massive
612.762	shortages of health workers.
616.652	Emile died,
617.832	and a few weeks later his sister died,
619.713	and a few weeks later his mother died.
621.657	And this disease would spread
621.657	from one community to another.
624.856	And it wasn't until three months later
626.905	that the world recognized this as Ebola.
630.124	When every minute counted,
630.124	we had already lost months,
632.846	and by then the virus had spread
632.846	like wildfire all across West Africa,
636.323	and eventually to other
636.323	parts of the world.
638.373	Businesses shut down,
638.373	airlines started canceling routes.
641.695	At the height of the crisis,
643.135	when we were told that 1.4 million
643.135	people could be infected,
647.604	when we were told
647.604	that most of them would die,
651.131	when we had nearly lost all hope,
655.498	I remember standing with a group
655.498	of health workers
658.394	in the rainforest where
658.394	an outbreak had just happened.
661.176	We were helping train and equip
661.176	them to put on the masks,
664.189	the gloves and the gowns that they needed
666.253	to keep themselves safe from the virus
668.272	while they were serving their patients.
670.604	I remember the fear in their eyes.
674.312	And I remember staying up at night,
674.312	terrified if I'd made the right call
680.339	to keep them in the field.
682.577	When Ebola threatened to bring
682.577	humanity to its knees,
687.316	Liberia's community health workers
687.316	didn't surrender to fear.
691.599	They did what they had always done:
693.951	they answered the call
693.951	to serve their neighbors.
697.406	Community members across Liberia
697.406	learned the symptoms of Ebola,
701.198	teamed up with nurses and doctors
701.198	to go door-to-door to find the sick
704.775	and get them into care.
706.355	They tracked thousands of people
706.355	who had been exposed to the virus
709.789	and helped break
709.789	the chain of transmission.
712.236	Some ten thousand community
712.236	health workers risked their own lives
715.57	to help hunt down this virus
715.57	and stop it in its tracks.
719.347	(Applause)
726.516	Today, Ebola has come
726.516	under control in West Africa,
730.05	and we've learned a few things.
732.169	We've learned that blind spots
732.169	in rural health care
734.791	can lead to hot spots of disease,
736.613	and that places all of us at greater risk.
739.522	We've learned that the most efficient
739.522	emergency system
742.238	is actually an everyday system,
744.29	and that system has to reach
744.29	all communities,
747.04	including rural communities like Emile's.
750.36	And most of all,
751.535	we've learned from the courage
751.535	of Liberia's community health workers
755.02	that we as people are not defined
755.02	by the conditions we face,
758.765	no matter how hopeless they seem.
761.96	We're defined by how we respond to them.
766.12	For the past 15 years,
769.069	I've seen the power of this idea
771.096	to transform everyday citizens
771.096	into community health workers --
775.217	into everyday heroes.
777.944	And I've seen it play out everywhere,
779.77	from the forest communities
779.77	of West Africa,
781.852	to the rural fishing villages of Alaska.
784.799	It's true,
785.973	these community health workers
785.973	aren't doing neurosurgery,
789.046	but they're making it possible
790.562	to bring health care within reach
790.562	of everyone everywhere.
795.465	So now what?
797.632	Well, we know that there are still
797.632	millions of people dying
801.42	from preventable causes
803.193	in rural communities around the world.
805.092	And we know that the great majority
805.092	of these deaths are happening
808.957	in these 75 blue-shaded countries.
811.669	What we also know
812.844	is that if we trained an army
812.844	of community health workers
816.311	to learn even just 30 lifesaving skills,
820.328	we could save the lives of nearly
825.472	Thirty services could save
830.141	That's not just a blueprint --
831.908	we're proving this can be done.
833.727	In Liberia,
834.911	the Liberian government is training
834.911	thousands of workers like A.B. and Musu
839.2	after Ebola,
840.382	to bring health care to every
840.382	child and family in the country.
843.883	And we've been honored to work with them,
845.938	and are now teaming up
845.938	with a number of organizations
848.47	that are working across other countries
850.716	to try to help them do the same thing.
853.825	If we could help these countries scale,
857.37	we could save millions of lives,
859.026	and at the same time,
860.406	we could create millions of jobs.
863.695	We simply can't do that, though,
863.695	without technology.
867.106	People are worried that technology
867.106	is going to steal our jobs,
870.218	but when it comes
870.218	to community health workers,
872.441	technology has actually
872.441	been vital for creating jobs.
875.721	Without technology --
875.721	without this smartphone,
878.161	without this rapid test --
881.78	it would have been impossible for us
881.78	to be able to employ A.B. and Musu.
887.284	And I think it's time
887.284	for technology to help us train,
889.99	to help us train people faster
889.99	and better than ever before.
894.398	As a doctor,
895.572	I use technology to stay up-to-date
895.572	and keep certified.
899.087	I use smartphones, I use apps,
899.087	I use online courses.
901.806	But when A.B. wants to learn,
904.042	he's got to jump back in that canoe
906.972	and get to the training center.
908.636	And when Musu shows up for training,
911.53	her instructors are stuck using
911.53	flip charts and markers.
915.967	Why shouldn't they have the same
915.967	access to learn as I do?
922.204	If we truly want community health workers
922.204	to master those lifesaving skills
925.856	and even more,
927.918	we've got to change this old-school
927.918	model of education.
932.102	Tech can truly be a game changer here.
934.024	I've been in awe of the digital
934.024	education revolution
937.593	that the likes of Khan Academy
937.593	and edX have been leading.
941.861	And I've been thinking that it's time;
944.378	it's time for a collision
945.793	between the digital education revolution
948.128	and the community health revolution.
951.303	And so, this brings me
951.303	to my TED Prize wish.
955.579	I wish --
957.404	I wish that you would help us recruit
959.634	the largest army of community health
959.634	workers the world has ever known
963.888	by creating the Community Health Academy,
966.737	a global platform to train,
966.737	connect and empower.
970.617	(Applause)
971.808	Thank you.
972.995	(Applause)
976.621	Thank you.
979.636	Here's the idea:
981.204	we'll create and curate
983.886	the best in digital education resources.
988.622	We will bring those to community
988.622	health workers around the world,
993.281	including A.B. and Musu.
994.558	They'll get video lessons
994.558	on giving kids vaccines
997.384	and have online courses
997.384	on spotting the next outbreak,
1000.621	so they're not stuck using flip charts.
1002.528	We'll help these countries
1002.528	accredit these workers,
1006.388	so that they're not stuck remaining
1006.388	an under-recognized, undervalued group,
1011.119	but become a renowned,
1011.119	empowered profession,
1013.88	just like nurses and doctors.
1017.226	And we'll create a network
1017.226	of companies and entrepreneurs
1020.573	who've created innovations
1020.573	that can save lives
1022.873	and help them connect
1022.873	to workers like Musu,
1025.277	so she can help better
1025.277	serve her community.
1028.779	And we'll work tirelessly
1028.779	to persuade governments
1032.009	to make community health workers
1032.009	a cornerstone of their health care plans.
1037.554	We plan to test and prototype
1037.554	the academy in Liberia
1041.367	and a few other partner countries,
1043.263	and then we plan to take it global,
1045.074	including to rural North America.
1047.923	With the power of this platform,
1049.537	we believe countries can be more persuaded
1052.123	that a health care revolution
1052.123	really is possible.
1056.29	My dream is that this academy
1056.29	will contribute to the training
1060.402	of hundreds of thousands
1060.402	of community members
1062.638	to help bring health care
1062.638	to their neighbors --
1065.561	the hundreds of millions of them
1067.195	that live in the world's most
1067.195	remote communities,
1070.605	from the forest communities
1070.605	of West Africa,
1072.71	to the fishing villages of rural Alaska;
1074.874	from the hilltops of Appalachia,
1074.874	to the mountains of Afghanistan.
1078.96	If this vision is aligned with yours,
1081.674	head to communityhealthacademy.org,
1085.56	and join this revolution.
1088.356	Let us know if you or your organization
1088.356	or someone you know could help us
1093.033	as we try to build this academy
1093.033	over the next year.
1097.394	Now, as I look out into this room,
1100.13	I realize that our journeys
1100.13	are not self-made;
1102.86	they're shaped by others.
1104.393	And there have been so many here
1104.393	that have been part of this cause.
1108.26	We're so honored to be part
1108.26	of this community,
1111.494	and a community that's willing
1111.494	to take on a cause
1114.201	as audacious as this one,
1115.593	so I wanted to offer, as I end,
1117.692	a reflection.
1119.806	I think a lot more about
1119.806	what my father taught me.
1123.546	These days, I too have become a dad.
1125.771	I have two sons,
1127.811	and my wife and I just learned
1127.811	that she's pregnant with our third child.
1131.823	(Applause)
1132.855	Thank you.
1133.946	(Applause)
1135.876	I was recently caring
1135.876	for a woman in Liberia
1138.728	who, like my wife,
1138.728	was in her third pregnancy.
1142.191	But unlike my wife,
1144.778	had had no prenatal care
1144.778	with her first two babies.
1149.369	She lived in an isolated community
1149.369	in the forest that had gone for 100 years
1153.785	without any health care
1156.333	until ...
1157.985	until last year when a nurse
1157.985	trained her neighbors
1161.392	to become community health workers.
1163.127	So here I was,
1164.443	seeing this patient
1164.443	who was in her second trimester,
1168.707	and I pulled out the ultrasound
1168.707	to check on the baby,
1172.003	and she started telling us stories
1172.003	about her first two kids,
1175.566	and I had the ultrasound
1175.566	probe on her belly,
1178.788	and she just stopped mid-sentence.
1183.041	She turned to me and she said,
1184.606	"""Doc, what's that sound?"""
1189.191	It was the first time she'd ever heard
1189.191	her baby's heartbeat.
1193.931	And her eyes lit up in the same way
1193.931	my wife's eyes and my own eyes lit up
1199.015	when we heard our baby's heartbeat.
1203.364	For all of human history,
1205.541	illness has been universal
1205.541	and access to care has not.
1210.097	But as a wise man once told me:
1213.51	no condition is permanent.
1217.311	It's time.
1218.563	It's time for us to go as far as it takes
1220.91	to change this condition together.
1223.514	Thank you.
1224.692	(Applause)
