12.8	So I grew up in Orlando, Florida.
16	I was the son of an aerospace engineer.
19.32	I lived and breathed the Apollo program.
22.08	We either saw the launches
22.08	from our backyard
24.16	or we saw it by driving
24.16	in the hour over to the Cape.
27.84	I was impressed by, obviously,
27.84	space and everything about it,
30.722	but I was most impressed
30.722	by the engineering that went into it.
34.72	Behind me you see an amazing view,
37.44	a picture that was taken
37.44	from the International Space Station,
41.36	and it shows a portion of our planet
43.56	that's rarely seen and rarely studied
46	and almost never explored.
48.32	That place is called the stratosphere.
50.88	If you start on the planet
50.88	and you go up and up and up,
54.04	it gets colder and colder and colder,
56.64	until you reach the beginning
56.64	of the stratosphere,
59.04	and then an amazing thing happens.
61.68	It gets colder at a much slower rate,
61.68	and then it starts warming up,
65.72	and then it gets warmer and warmer
67.4	until the point where you can
67.4	almost survive without any protection,
72.36	about zero degrees,
74.2	and then you end up
74.2	getting colder and colder,
77.519	and that's the top of the stratosphere.
79.76	It is one of the least accessible
79.76	places on our planet.
83.72	Most often, when it's visited,
85.48	it's by astronauts
85.48	who are blazing up at it
89.4	at probably several times
89.4	the speed of sound,
92.28	and they get a few seconds on the way up,
94.28	and then they get this blazing
94.28	ball of fire coming back in,
99.08	on the way back in.
101.04	But the question I asked is, is it
101.04	possible to linger in the stratosphere?
105.36	Is it possible to experience
105.36	the stratosphere?
107.72	Is it possible to explore
107.72	the stratosphere?
114.64	I studied this using
114.64	my favorite search engine
117.44	for quite a while, about a year,
120.48	and then I made a scary phone call.
124	It was a reference from a friend of mine
124	to call Taber MacCallum
127.72	from Paragon Space
127.72	Development Corporation,
130.48	and I asked him the question:
131.885	is it possible to build
136	a system to go into the stratosphere?
138.16	And he said it was.
139.76	And after a period of about three years,
139.76	we proceeded to do just that.
146.48	And on October 24 of last year,
149.68	in this suit,
151.44	I started on the ground,
153.72	I went up in a balloon to 135,890 feet --
160.36	but who's counting?
161.6	(Laughter)
164.08	Came back to Earth
164.08	at speeds of up to 822 miles an hour.
169.8	It was a four-minute
169.8	and 27-second descent.
173.6	And when I got to 10,000 feet,
173.6	I opened a parachute and I landed.
178.12	(Applause)
186	But this is really a science talk,
186	and it's really an engineering talk,
190.08	and what was amazing to me
190.08	about that experience
192.4	is that Taber said, yes, I think
192.4	we can build a stratospheric suit,
197.08	and more than that, come down tomorrow
199.72	and let's talk to the team
199.72	that formed the core of the group
202.88	that actually built it.
204.4	And they did something
204.4	which I think is important,
208.76	which is they took
208.76	the analogy of scuba diving.
212.12	So in scuba diving,
213.84	you have a self-contained system.
215.68	You have everything
215.68	that you could ever need.
218.04	You have a scuba tank.
220.48	You have a wetsuit.
223.16	You have visibility.
224.92	And that scuba is exactly this system,
227.68	and we're going to launch it
227.68	into the stratosphere.
230.92	Three years later, this is what we have.
234.16	We've got an amazing suit
234.16	that was made by ILC Dover.
238.88	ILC Dover was the company
238.88	that made all of the Apollo suits
242.36	and all of the extravehicular
242.36	activity suits.
244.8	They had never sold a suit commercially,
248.08	only to the government,
249.68	but they sold one to me,
249.68	which I am very grateful for.
253.32	Up here we have a parachute.
253.32	This was all about safety.
257.24	Everyone on the team knew
262.08	that I have a wife
262.08	and two small children --
267.44	and I wanted to come back safely.
269.519	So there's a main parachute
269.519	and a reserve parachute,
271.973	and if I do nothing,
273.76	the reserve parachute is going to open
273.76	because of an automatic opening device.
278.16	The suit itself
278.16	can protect me from the cold.
280.32	This area in the front here
280.32	has thermal protection.
283.28	It will actually heat water
283.28	that will wrap around my body.
286.48	It has two redundant oxygen tanks.
288.96	Even if I was to get
288.96	a quarter-inch hole in this suit,
292.04	which is extremely unlikely,
294.64	this system would still protect me
294.64	from the low pressure of space.
299.32	The main advantage of this system
299.32	is weight and complexity.
303	So the system weighs about 500 pounds,
306	and if you compare it to the other attempt
306	recently to go up in the stratosphere,
309.84	they used a capsule.
311.12	And to do a capsule, there's an amazing
311.12	amount of complexity that goes into it,
315.12	and it weighed about 3,000 pounds,
317.08	and to raise 3,000 pounds
317.08	to an altitude of 135,000 feet,
321.8	which was my target altitude,
323.96	it would have taken a balloon
323.96	that was 45 to 50 million cubic feet.
330.84	Because I only weighed
334.2	we could do it with a balloon
334.2	that was five times smaller than that,
337.44	and that allowed us to use a launch system
337.44	that was dramatically simpler
341.88	than what needs to be done
341.88	for a much larger balloon.
345.48	So with that, I want to take you
345.48	to Roswell, New Mexico, on October 24.
350.16	We had an amazing team
350.16	that got up in the middle of the night.
353.88	And here's the suit.
356.48	Again, this is using the front loader
356.48	that you'll see in a second,
359.64	and I want to play you a video
359.64	of the actual launch.
362.88	Roswell's a great place
362.88	to launch balloons,
364.92	but it's a fantastic place
364.92	to land under a parachute,
368.12	especially when you're going to land
373.64	That's a helium truck in the background.
376.36	It's darkness.
377.64	I've already spent about an hour
377.64	and a half pre-breathing.
380.88	And then here you see the suit going on.
384.96	It takes about an hour to get the suit on.
389.48	Astronauts get this really nice
389.48	air-conditioned van
393.24	to go to the launch pad,
393.24	but I got a front loader.
395.84	(Laughter)
398.04	You can see the top.
398.04	You can see the balloon up there.
400.6	That's where the helium is.
404.64	This is Dave clearing the airspace
404.64	with the FAA for 15 miles.
412.36	And there we go.
416.52	(Laughter)
418.24	That's me waving with my left hand.
419.96	The reason I'm waving with my left hand
422.04	is because on the right hand
422.04	is the emergency cutaway.
424.72	(Laughter)
426.32	My team forbade me
426.32	from using my right hand.
431.28	So the trip up is beautiful.
431.28	It's kind of like Google Earth in reverse.
434.64	(Laughter)
437.48	It took two hours
437.48	and seven minutes to go up,
439.6	and it was the most peaceful
439.6	two hours and seven minutes.
442.36	I was mostly trying to relax.
445.92	My heart rate was very low
447.96	and I was trying not to use
447.96	very much oxygen.
451.84	You can see how the fields
451.84	in the background
454.6	are relatively big at this point,
456.24	and you can see me going up and up.
458.32	It's interesting here,
458.32	because if you look,
460.36	I'm right over the airport,
460.36	and I'm probably at 50,000 feet,
463.76	but immediately I'm about to go
463.76	into a stratospheric wind
466.48	of over 120 miles an hour.
471.44	This is my flight director telling me
471.44	that I had just gone higher
475.2	than anybody else
475.2	had ever gone in a balloon,
477.44	and I was about 4,000 feet from release.
481.68	This is what it looks like.
486.24	You can see the darkness of space,
486.24	the curvature of the Earth,
490.08	the fragile planet below.
500.2	I'm practicing my emergency procedures
500.2	mentally right now.
504.64	If anything goes wrong,
504.64	I want to be ready.
506.68	And the main thing that I want to do here
508.88	is to have a release and fall
508.88	and stay completely stable.
515.32	(Video) Ground control. Everyone ready?
523.72	Five. Four. Three. Two. One.
539.84	Alan Eustace: There's the balloon
539.84	going by, fully inflated at this point.
544.678	And there you can see a drogue parachute,
544.678	which I'll demonstrate in just a second,
548.56	because that's really important.
550.16	There's the balloon
550.16	going by a second time.
561.2	Right now, I'm about
561.2	at the speed of sound.
564.64	There's nothing for me to tell
564.64	it's the speed of sound,
567.88	and very soon I will actually be
567.88	as fast as I ever get,
589.2	(Video) Ground control: We lost the data.
594.96	AE: So now I'm down low right now
596.6	and you can basically see
596.6	the parachute come out right there.
601.92	At this point, I'm very happy
601.92	that there's a parachute out.
605.789	I thought I was the only one happy,
607.48	but it turns out mission control
607.48	was really happy as well.
610.84	The really nice thing about this
610.84	is the moment I opened --
613.96	I had a close of friend of mine,
613.96	Blikkies, my parachute guy.
617.36	He flew in another airplane,
617.36	and he actually jumped out
620.32	and landed right next to me.
622.32	He was my wingman on the descent.
625.6	This is my landing, but it's probably more
625.6	properly called a crash.
630.84	(Laughter)
635.08	I hate to admit it, but this wasn't
635.08	even close to my worst landing.
638.56	(Laughter)
641.44	(Applause)
660.16	(Video) Man: How are you doing?
661.68	AE: Hi there!
667.28	Yay.
668.52	(Laughter)
670.84	So I want to tell you one thing
672.36	that you might not have seen
672.36	in that video,
674.68	but one of the most critical parts
674.68	of the entire thing was the release
678.56	and what happens right after you release.
681.44	And what we tried to do was use
681.44	something called a drogue parachute,
685.76	and a drogue parachute
685.76	was there to stabilize me.
688.48	And I'll show you one of those right now.
690.56	If any of you have ever
690.56	gone tandem skydiving,
694.12	you probably used one of these.
698.2	But the problem with one of these things
700.16	is right when you release,
700.16	you're in zero gravity.
703.12	So it's very easy for this
703.12	to just turn right around you.
706.76	And before you know it,
706.76	you can be tangled up or spinning,
711.32	or you can release this drogue late,
714	in which case what happens
714	is you're going down at 800 miles an hour,
718.08	and this thing is going to destroy itself
720.6	and not be very useful.
723.4	But the guys at United Parachute
723.4	Technologies came up with this idea,
727.72	and it was a roll that looks like that,
729.68	but watch what happens when I pull it out.
733.56	It's forming a pipe.
736.68	This pipe is so solid
740.36	that you can take this drogue parachute
740.36	and wrap it around,
744.16	and there's no way
744.16	it will ever tangle with you.
747.68	And that prevented
747.68	a very serious potential problem.
751.56	So nothing is possible
751.56	without an amazing team of people.
754.52	The core of this was about 20 people
757	that worked on this for the three years,
759.12	and they were incredible.
760.76	People asked me what the best part
760.76	of this whole thing was,
763.56	and it was a chance
763.56	to work with the best experts
766.04	in meteorology and ballooning
766.04	and parachute technology
770.68	and environmental systems
770.68	and high altitude medicine.
775.16	It was fantastic. It's an engineer's dream
775.16	to work with that group of people.
779.32	And I also at the same time
779.32	wanted to thank my friends at Google,
782.6	both for supporting me during this effort
785.48	and also covering for me
785.48	in the times that I was away.
788.8	But there's one other group
788.8	I wanted to thank, and that's my family.
792.12	Yay.
793.36	(Applause)
799.6	I would constantly give them speeches
799.6	about the safety of technology,
803.32	and they weren't hearing any of it.
807.08	It was super hard on them,
808.48	and the only reason
808.48	that my wife put up with it
811.08	was because I came back incredibly happy
811.08	after each of the 250 tests,
816.6	and she didn't want
816.6	to take that away from me.
818.8	So I want to close with a story.
820.6	My daughter Katelyn, my 15-year-old,
820.6	she and I were in the car,
825.2	and we were driving down the road,
825.2	and she was sitting there,
828.68	and she had this idea, and she goes,
828.68	"""Dad, I've got this idea."""
832.08	And so I listened to her idea
832.08	"and I said, ""Katelyn, that's impossible."""
837.32	And she looks at me
838.96	"and she goes, ""Dad,"
838.96	after what you just did,
842.32	"how can you call anything impossible?"""
845.76	And I laughed, and I said,
845.76	"""OK, it's not impossible,"
849.04	"it's just very, very hard."""
852.84	And then I paused for a second,
852.84	"and I said, ""Katelyn,"
855.76	it may not be impossible,
855.76	it may not even be very, very hard,
859.52	"it's just that I don't know how to do it."""
862.32	Thank you.
863.56	(Applause)
