15.26	I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer.
17.506	I've been making games
17.506	online now for 10 years,
20.26	and my goal for the next decade
23.26	is to try to make it as easy
23.26	to save the world in real life
28.68	as it is to save the world
28.68	in online games.
31.886	Now, I have a plan for this,
33.901	and it entails convincing more people,
36.838	including all of you, to spend more time
36.838	playing bigger and better games.
41.719	Right now we spend three billion hours
41.719	a week playing online games.
46.617	Some of you might be thinking,
48.26	"""That's a lot of time"
48.26	to spend playing games.
50.427	Maybe too much time,
51.753	considering how many urgent problems
51.753	"we have to solve in the real world."""
55.26	But actually, according to my research
55.26	at the Institute for the Future,
59.26	actually the opposite is true.
62.26	Three billion hours a week
62.26	is not nearly enough game play
65.609	to solve the world's most urgent problems.
68.031	In fact, I believe
68.031	that if we want to survive
70.674	the next century on this planet,
72.26	we need to increase
72.26	that total dramatically.
74.807	I've calculated the total we need
76.809	at 21 billion hours
76.809	of game play every week.
80.807	So, that's probably a bit
80.807	of a counter-intuitive idea,
83.473	so I'll say it again, let it sink in:
86.038	If we want to solve problems like hunger,
88.26	poverty, climate change,
88.26	global conflict, obesity,
91.53	I believe that we need to aspire
91.53	to play games online
95.57	for at least 21 billion hours a week,
95.57	by the end of the next decade.
99.166	(Laughter)
100.198	No. I'm serious. I am.
102.34	Here's why.
103.515	This picture pretty much sums up
103.515	why I think games are so essential
106.782	to the future survival
106.782	of the human species.
108.945	(Laughter)
109.973	Truly.
111.148	This is a portrait
111.148	by photographer Phil Toledano.
113.789	He wanted to capture
113.789	the emotion of gaming,
116.053	so he set up a camera in front
116.053	of gamers while they were playing.
119.187	And this is a classic gaming emotion.
122.136	Now, if you're not a gamer,
124.065	you might miss some
124.065	of the nuance in this photo.
126.486	You probably see the sense of urgency,
129.26	a little bit of fear,
129.26	but intense concentration,
132.668	deep, deep focus on tackling
132.668	a really difficult problem.
136.26	If you are a gamer, you will notice
136.26	a few nuances here:
140.021	the crinkle of the eyes up,
140.021	and around the mouth
142.834	is a sign of optimism,
144.453	and the eyebrows up is surprise.
146.912	This is a gamer who's on the verge
146.912	"of something called an ""epic win."""
151.063	(Laughter)
152.26	Oh, you've heard of that.
153.69	OK, good, so we have some gamers among us.
156.246	An epic win is an outcome
156.246	that is so extraordinarily positive,
160.516	you had no idea it was even
160.516	possible until you achieved it.
163.556	It was almost beyond the threshold
163.556	of imagination, and when you get there,
167.839	you're shocked to discover
167.839	what you're truly capable of.
170.522	That's an epic win.
171.704	This is a gamer on the verge
171.704	of an epic win.
174.112	And this is the face that we need to see
176.549	on millions of problem-solvers
176.549	all over the world
179.26	as we try to tackle the obstacles
179.26	of the next century --
182.605	the face of someone who, against all odds,
185.26	is on the verge of an epic win.
187.181	Now, unfortunately this is more
187.181	of the face that we see
190.521	in everyday life now as we try
190.521	to tackle urgent problems.
193.316	This is what I call
193.316	"the ""I'm Not Good At Life"" face."
195.839	This is actually me making it.
197.363	Can you see? Yes. Good.
198.64	This is me making
198.64	"the ""I'm Not Good At Life"" face."
201.26	This is a piece of graffiti
201.26	in my old neighborhood
203.665	in Berkeley, California,
203.665	where I did my PhD
205.944	on why we're better in games
205.944	than we are in real life.
209.182	And this is a problem
209.182	that a lot of gamers have.
211.485	We feel that we are not as good
211.485	in reality as we are in games.
215.786	I don't mean just good as in successful,
215.786	although that's part of it.
219.26	We do achieve more in game worlds.
221.129	But I also mean good as in motivated
221.129	to do something that matters --
225.119	inspired to collaborate and to cooperate.
227.927	And when we're in game worlds,
229.403	I believe that many of us become
229.403	the best version of ourselves --
232.484	the most likely to help
232.484	at a moment's notice,
234.626	the most likely to stick
234.626	with a problem as long at it takes,
237.491	to get up after failure and try again.
239.601	And in real life, when we face failure,
243.26	when we confront obstacles,
243.26	we often don't feel that way.
246.174	We feel overcome, we feel overwhelmed,
249.04	we feel anxious, maybe depressed,
249.04	frustrated or cynical.
252.804	We never have those feelings
252.804	when we're playing games,
255.384	they just don't exist in games.
256.947	So that's what I wanted to study
256.947	when I was a graduate student.
260.028	What about games makes it impossible
262.524	to feel that we can't achieve everything?
265.001	How can we take those feelings from games
267.429	and apply them to real-world work?
269.116	So I looked at games
269.116	like World of Warcraft,
271.538	which is really the ideal collaborative
271.538	problem-solving environment.
274.847	And I started to notice a few things
276.695	that make epic wins
276.695	so possible in online worlds.
279.876	The first thing is whenever you show up
279.876	in one of these online games,
283.185	especially in World of Warcraft,
284.788	there are lots and lots
284.788	of different characters
287.106	who are willing to trust you
287.106	with a world-saving mission, right away.
291.384	But not just any mission,
292.909	it's a mission that is perfectly matched
292.909	with your current level in the game.
296.749	Right? So you can do it.
298.479	They never give you a challenge
298.479	you can't achieve.
300.948	But it is on the verge
300.948	of what you're capable of,
303.347	so you have to try hard.
304.615	But there's no unemployment
304.615	in World of Warcraft; no sitting around,
307.96	wringing your hands --
309.135	there's always something
309.135	specific and important to be done.
311.978	There are also tons of collaborators.
313.835	Everywhere you go,
313.835	hundreds of thousands of people
316.247	ready to work with you
316.247	to achieve your epic mission.
319.213	That's not something we have
319.213	in real life that easily,
321.863	this sense that at our fingertips
321.863	are tons of collaborators.
324.876	And there's this epic story,
324.876	this inspiring story of why we're there,
328.391	and what we're doing,
329.576	and we get all this positive feedback.
331.478	You guys have heard of leveling up,
331.478	+1 strength, +1 intelligence.
335.495	We don't get that kind
335.495	of constant feedback in real life.
338.201	When I get off this stage,
339.466	I'm not going to have
339.466	+1 speaking, and +1 crazy idea,
344.372	+20 crazy idea.
346.06	I don't get that feedback in real life.
348.102	Now, the problem with collaborative
348.102	online environments like World of Warcraft
352.974	is that it's so satisfying to be
352.974	on the verge of an epic win all the time,
357.153	we decide to spend all our time
357.153	in these game worlds.
359.752	It's just better than reality.
361.26	So, so far, collectively
361.26	all the World of Warcraft gamers
364.26	have spent 5.93 million years
367.26	solving the virtual problems of Azeroth.
371.26	Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing.
373.777	It might sound like it's a bad thing.
375.66	But to put that in context:
377.008	5.93 million years ago
379.115	was when our earliest primate
379.115	human ancestors stood up.
383.764	That was the first upright primate.
386.518	So when we talk about how much time
389.646	we're currently investing
389.646	in playing games,
391.682	the only way it makes sense
391.682	to even think about it
394.484	is to talk about time
394.484	at the magnitude of human evolution,
398.26	which is an extraordinary thing.
400.26	But it's also apt,
401.792	because it turns out that by spending
401.792	all this time playing games,
404.974	we're actually changing
404.974	what we are capable of as human beings.
408.26	We're evolving to be a more
408.26	collaborative and hearty species.
411.923	This is true. I believe this.
413.709	So, consider this really
413.709	interesting statistic;
416.574	it was recently published by a researcher
416.574	at Carnegie Mellon University:
420.082	The average young person today
420.082	in a country with a strong gamer culture
424.26	will have spent 10,000 hours
424.26	playing online games
427.938	by the age of 21.
429.699	Now 10,000 hours is a really
429.699	interesting number for two reasons.
433.68	First of all, for children
433.68	in the United States,
	of time you will spend in school,
442.158	from fifth grade
442.158	to high school graduation,
444.284	if you have perfect attendance.
445.831	(Laughter)
446.856	So, we have an entire
446.856	parallel track of education going on,
450.465	where young people are learning as much
450.465	about what it takes to be a good gamer
454.197	as they're learning
454.197	about everything else in school.
456.701	Some of you have probably read
456.701	"Malcolm Gladwell's new book ""Outliers,"""
460.312	so you would have heard
460.312	of his theory of success,
462.678	"the ""10,000 hours"" theory of success."
464.801	It's based on this great
464.801	cognitive-science research
467.26	that says if we can master 10,000 hours
470.601	of effortful study at anything
470.601	by the age of 21,
473.998	we will be virtuosos at it.
475.521	We will be as good at whatever we do
477.26	as the greatest people in the world.
479.125	And so, now what we're looking at
481.907	is an entire generation of young people
481.907	who are virtuoso gamers.
487.018	So, the big question is,
489.26	"""What exactly are gamers"
489.26	"getting so good at?"""
492.601	Because if we could figure that out,
494.41	we would have a virtually unprecedented
494.41	human resource on our hands.
498.839	This is how many people
498.839	we now have in the world
501.126	who spend at least an hour
501.126	a day playing online games.
504.037	These are our virtuoso gamers,
	extraordinarily good at something.
510.918	And in the next decade,
512.26	we're going to have another billion gamers
514.284	who are extraordinarily
514.284	good at whatever that is.
517.085	If you don't know it already,
517.085	this is coming.
519.26	The game industry is developing consoles
521.26	that are low-energy and that work
521.26	with the wireless phone networks
524.638	instead of broadband Internet,
526.488	so that gamers all over the world,
528.26	particularly in India, China,
528.26	Brazil, can get online.
532.108	They expect one billion more
532.108	gamers in the next decade.
534.758	It will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers.
537.217	So I've started to think about
538.709	what these games
538.709	are making us virtuosos at.
540.949	Here are the four things I came up with.
542.924	The first is urgent optimism.
544.908	OK, think of this
544.908	as extreme self-motivation.
548.003	Urgent optimism is the desire
548.003	to act immediately
551.075	to tackle an obstacle,
552.756	combined with the belief that we have
552.756	a reasonable hope of success.
557.003	Gamers always believe
557.003	that an epic win is possible,
559.713	and that it's always worth
559.713	trying, and trying now.
562.442	Gamers don't sit around.
564.033	Gamers are virtuosos
564.033	at weaving a tight social fabric.
568.113	There's a lot of interesting
568.113	research that shows
570.394	we like people better
570.394	after we play a game with them,
572.974	even if they've beaten us badly.
574.807	And the reason is, it takes a lot of trust
574.807	to play a game with someone.
578.173	We trust that they will spend
578.173	their time with us,
580.489	that they will play by the same rules,
582.355	value the same goal,
582.355	stay with the game until it's over.
585.711	And so, playing a game together
587.303	actually builds up bonds
587.303	and trust and cooperation.
590.26	And we actually build stronger
590.26	social relationships as a result.
594.498	Blissful productivity. I love it.
596.26	You know, there's a reason why
596.26	the average World of Warcraft gamer
599.578	plays for 22 hours a week --
599.578	kind of a half-time job.
602.26	It's because we know,
602.26	when we're playing a game,
604.886	that we're actually happier working hard
607.259	than we are relaxing, or hanging out.
609.534	We know that we are
609.534	optimized as human beings,
611.836	to do hard and meaningful work.
613.478	And gamers are willing
613.478	to work hard all the time,
616.709	if they're given the right work.
619.089	Finally: epic meaning.
621.034	Gamers love to be attached
621.034	to awe-inspiring missions
624.795	to human planetary-scale stories.
628.831	So, just one bit of trivia
628.831	that helps put that into perspective:
632.595	So, you all know Wikipedia,
632.595	biggest wiki in the world.
636.617	Second biggest wiki in the world,
636.617	with nearly 80,000 articles,
640.26	is the World of Warcraft wiki.
642.26	Five million people use it every month.
644.26	They have compiled more information
644.26	about World of Warcraft on the Internet
647.943	than any other topic covered
647.943	on any other wiki in the world.
651.074	They are building an epic story.
653.134	They are building an epic
653.134	knowledge resource
655.38	about the World of Warcraft.
656.936	Okay, so these are four superpowers
656.936	that add up to one thing:
661.26	Gamers are super-empowered
661.26	hopeful individuals.
666.055	These are people who believe
666.055	that they are individually capable
669.284	of changing the world.
670.858	And the only problem is,
672.517	they believe that they are capable
672.517	of changing virtual worlds
675.57	and not the real world.
677.26	That's the problem
677.26	that I'm trying to solve.
679.873	There's an economist
679.873	named Edward Castronova.
682.26	His work is brilliant.
683.454	He looks at why people are investing
683.454	so much time and energy
686.38	and money in online worlds.
688.26	And he says,
689.467	"""We're witnessing what amounts to"
689.467	no less than a mass exodus
692.799	to virtual worlds and online
692.799	"game environments."""
695.26	And he's an economist, so he's rational.
697.473	And he says --
698.934	(Laughter)
700.601	Not like me, I'm a game
700.601	designer; I'm exuberant.
702.91	But he says that this makes perfect sense,
707.133	because gamers can achieve
707.133	more in online worlds
709.581	than they can in real life.
710.931	They can have stronger
710.931	social relationships in games
713.416	than they can have in real life;
714.995	they get better feedback
714.995	and feel more rewarded in games
717.986	than they do in real life.
719.26	So he says, for now it makes perfect sense
721.284	for gamers to spend more time
721.284	in virtual worlds than the real world.
724.883	Now, I also agree
724.883	that that is rational, for now.
728.26	But it is not, by any means,
728.26	an optimal situation.
731.26	We have to start making
731.26	the real world work more like a game.
734.637	I take my inspiration
734.637	from something that happened
737.643	2,500 years ago.
739.652	These are ancient dice,
739.652	made out of sheep's knuckles.
743.26	Before we had awesome game controllers,
745.26	we had sheep's knuckles.
747.097	And these represent
747.097	the first game equipment
750.189	designed by human beings,
752.079	and if you're familiar with the work
752.079	of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus,
755.847	you might know this history,
757.38	which is the history
757.38	of who invented games and why.
760.976	Herodotus says that games,
760.976	particularly dice games,
763.844	were invented in the kingdom of Lydia,
766.26	during a time of famine.
768.093	Apparently, there was such a severe famine
770.456	that the king of Lydia decided
770.456	they had to do something crazy.
774.26	People were suffering.
774.26	People were fighting.
776.38	It was an extreme situation,
776.38	they needed an extreme solution.
780.26	So, according to Herodotus,
780.26	they invented dice games,
783.26	and they set up a kingdom-wide policy:
786.26	On one day, everybody would eat,
788.866	and on the next day,
788.866	everybody would play games.
791.26	And they would be so immersed
791.26	in playing the dice games,
793.918	because games are so engaging,
795.386	and immerse us in such satisfying,
795.386	blissful productivity,
798.622	they would ignore the fact
798.622	that they had no food to eat.
801.36	And then on the next day,
801.36	they would play games;
803.67	and on the next day, they would eat.
805.57	And according to Herodotus,
807.26	they passed 18 years this way,
809.26	surviving through a famine,
811.023	by eating on one day,
811.023	and playing games on the next.
813.713	Now, this is exactly, I think,
813.713	how we're using games today.
817.986	We're using games to escape
817.986	real-world suffering --
820.717	we're using games to get away
822.332	from everything that's broken
822.332	in the real environment,
824.945	everything that's not satisfying
824.945	about real life,
827.515	and we're getting what we need from games.
829.637	But it doesn't have to end there.
831.26	This is really exciting.
833.26	According to Herodotus, after 18 years
833.26	the famine wasn't getting better,
838.26	so the king decided they would
838.26	play one final dice game.
842.668	They divided the entire kingdom in half.
845.429	They played one dice game,
847.161	and the winners of that game
847.161	got to go on an epic adventure.
850.604	They would leave Lydia,
852.26	and they would go out in search
852.26	of a new place to live,
855.259	leaving behind just enough people
857.483	to survive on the resources
857.483	that were available,
859.8	and hopefully to take their civilization
859.8	somewhere else where they could thrive.
863.649	Now, this sounds crazy, right?
865.572	But recently, DNA evidence
865.572	has shown that the Etruscans,
870.014	who then led to the Roman Empire,
871.8	actually share the same DNA
871.8	as the ancient Lydians.
874.729	And so, recently,
874.729	scientists have suggested
877.26	that Herodotus' crazy
877.26	story is actually true.
879.681	And geologists have found
879.681	evidence of a global cooling
882.674	that lasted for nearly 20 years,
882.674	that could have explained the famine.
886.434	So this crazy story might be true.
888.688	They might have actually saved
888.688	their culture by playing games,
892.608	escaping to games for 18 years,
894.554	and then been so inspired,
896.03	and knew so much about
896.03	how to come together with games,
898.736	that they actually saved
898.736	the entire civilization that way.
901.497	Okay, we can do that.
902.686	(Laughter)
903.732	We've been playing Warcraft since 1994.
906.094	That was the first real-time strategy
906.094	game from the World of Warcraft series.
909.789	That was 16 years ago.
911.6	They played dice games for 18 years,
913.417	we've been playing Warcraft for 16 years.
915.687	I say we are ready for our own epic game.
918.869	Now, they had half the civilization
918.869	go off in search of a new world,
923.503	so that's where I get my 21 billion
923.503	hours a week of game-play from.
927.376	Let's get half of us to agree
929.26	to spend an hour a day playing games,
931.26	until we solve real-world problems.
933.126	Now, I know you're asking,
934.722	"""How are we going to solve"
934.722	"real-world problems in games?"""
937.425	Well, that's what I've devoted
937.425	my work to over the past few years,
940.56	at the Institute for the Future.
942.26	We have this banner
942.26	in our offices in Palo Alto,
944.57	and it expresses our view of how
944.57	we should try to relate to the future.
948.705	We do not want to try
948.705	to predict the future.
950.99	What we want to do is make the future.
953.046	We want to imagine
953.046	the best-case scenario outcome,
955.562	and then we want to empower people
955.562	to make that outcome a reality.
959.26	We want to imagine epic wins,
961.26	and then give people the means
961.26	to achieve the epic win.
964.26	I'm just going to very briefly show you
964.26	three games that I've made
967.382	that are an attempt to give people
967.382	the means to create epic wins
970.462	in their own futures.
971.819	This is World Without Oil.
973.26	We made this game in 2007.
974.975	This is an online game
976.357	in which you try to survive
976.357	an oil shortage.
979.767	The oil shortage is fictional,
981.386	but we put enough online content out there
984.26	for you to believe that it's real,
985.964	and to live your real life
985.964	as if we've run out of oil.
988.874	So when you come to the game,
990.334	you sign up, tell us where you live,
992.287	and then we give you
992.287	real-time news videos,
994.651	data feeds that show you
994.651	exactly how much oil costs,
997.795	what's not available, how food
997.795	supply is being affected,
1000.548	how transportation is being affected,
1002.406	if schools are closed, if there's rioting,
1004.501	and you have to figure out
1004.501	how you would live your real life
1007.374	as if this were true.
1008.637	And then we ask you to blog about it,
1010.46	to post videos, to post photos.
1012.26	We piloted this game
1012.26	with 1,700 players in 2007,
1015.684	and we've tracked them
1015.684	for the three years since.
1018.041	And I can tell you that this
1018.041	is a transformative experience.
1021.142	Nobody wants to change how they live,
1023.049	just because it's good for the world,
1023.049	or because we're supposed to.
1026.778	But if you immerse them
1026.778	in an epic adventure
1029.26	"and tell them, ""We've run out of oil."
1031.26	This is an amazing story
1031.26	and adventure for you to go on.
1034.549	Challenge yourself to see
1034.549	"how you would survive,"""
1037.26	most of our players
1037.26	have kept up the habits
1039.332	that they learned in this game.
1041.152	So for the next world-saving game,
1043.26	we decided to aim higher --
1043.26	bigger problem than just peak oil.
1046.755	We did a game called Superstruct
1046.755	at the Institute for the Future.
1050.161	And the premise was,
1050.161	a supercomputer has calculated
1053.26	that humans have only 23 years
1053.26	left on the planet.
1056.26	This supercomputer was called
1057.833	the Global Extinction
1057.833	Awareness System, of course.
1060.594	We asked people to come online --
1062.26	almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.
1064.383	You know Jerry Bruckheimer
1064.383	movies, you form a dream team --
1067.26	you've got the astronaut,
1067.26	the scientist, the ex-convict,
1070.035	and they all have something
1070.035	to do to save the world.
1072.496	(Laughter)
1073.527	But in our game, instead of just having
1073.527	five people on the dream team,
1076.939	"we said, ""Everybody's on the dream team,"
1078.892	and it's your job to invent
1078.892	the future of energy,
1081.26	the future of food, the future of health,
1083.26	the future of security and the future
1083.26	"of the social safety net."""
1086.332	We had 8,000 people
1086.332	play that game for eight weeks.
1088.945	They came up with 500
1088.945	insanely creative solutions
1092.017	that you can go online,
1092.017	"Google ""Superstruct,"" and see."
1094.871	So, finally, the last game,
1096.26	we're launching it March 3rd.
1097.74	This is a game done
1097.74	with the World Bank Institute.
1100.198	If you complete the game,
1101.426	you will be certified
1101.426	by the World Bank Institute
1104.26	as a Social Innovator, class of 2010.
1106.982	Working with universities
1106.982	all over sub-Saharan Africa,
1110.26	and we are inviting them
1110.26	to learn social innovation skills.
1113.26	We've got a graphic novel,
1113.26	we've got leveling up
1116.26	in skills like local insight,
1116.26	knowledge networking,
1119.26	sustainability,
1119.26	vision and resourcefulness.
1121.745	I would like to invite all of you
1123.356	to please share this game
1123.356	with young people,
1125.515	anywhere in the world,
1125.515	particularly in developing areas,
1128.26	who might benefit from coming together
1130.482	to try to start to imagine their own
1130.482	social enterprises to save the world.
1135.01	So, I'm going to wrap up now.
1137.026	I want to ask a question.
1138.796	What do you think happens next?
1140.621	We've got all these amazing gamers,
1140.621	we've got these games
1143.313	that are kind of pilots
1143.313	of what we might do,
1145.449	but none of them
1145.449	have saved the real world yet.
1147.679	Well I hope you will agree with me
1147.679	that gamers are a human resource
1152.052	that we can use to do real-world work,
1154.26	that games are a powerful
1154.26	platform for change.
1156.837	We have all these amazing superpowers:
1158.853	blissful productivity, the ability
1158.853	to weave a tight social fabric,
1162.26	this feeling of urgent optimism
1162.26	and the desire for epic meaning.
1166.26	I really hope that we can come together
1166.26	to play games that matter,
1169.793	to survive on this planet
1169.793	for another century.
1172.043	That's my hope, that you will join me
1172.043	in making and playing games like this.
1175.719	When I look forward to the next decade,
1175.719	I know two things for sure:
1179.543	that we can make
1179.543	any future we can imagine,
1182.26	and we can play any games
1182.26	we want, so I say:
1185.394	Let the world-changing games begin.
1187.134	Thank you.
1188.316	(Applause)
