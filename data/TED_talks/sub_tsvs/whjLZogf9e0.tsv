18.26	Most of the talks
20.26	that you've heard in the last several fabulous days
23.26	have been from people who have the characteristic
25.26	that they have thought about something,
27.26	they are experts, they know what's going on.
31.26	All of you know about the topic
33.26	that I'm supposed to talk about.
35.26	That is, you know what simplicity is,
37.26	you know what complexity is.
39.26	The trouble is, I don't.
41.26	And what I'm going to do is share with you
43.26	my ignorance on this subject.
46.26	I want you to read this,
48.26	because we're going to come back to it in a moment.
53.26	The quote is from
55.26	the fabled Potter Stewart
59.26	opinion on pornography.
62.26	And let me just read it,
64.26	the important details here:
66.26	"""Shorthand description, ['hardcore pornography'];"
69.26	and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly defining it.
72.26	"But I know it when I see it."""
74.26	I'm going to come back to that in a moment.
77.26	So, what is simplicity?
79.26	It's good to start with some examples.
82.26	A coffee cup -- we don't think about coffee cups,
85.26	but it's much more interesting than one might think --
87.26	a coffee cup is a device,
90.26	which has a container and a handle.
93.26	The handle enables you to hold it
96.26	when the container is filled with hot liquid.
99.26	Why is that important?
101.26	Well, it enables you to drink coffee.
103.26	But also, by the way, the coffee is hot,
105.26	the liquid is sterile;
107.26	you're not likely to get cholera that way.
109.26	So the coffee cup, or the cup with a handle,
112.26	is one of the tools used by society
115.26	to maintain public health.
117.26	Scissors are your clothes,
119.26	glasses enable you to see things
121.26	and keep you from being eaten by cheetahs
123.26	or run down by automobiles,
125.26	and books are, after all, your education.
128.26	But there's another class of simple things,
130.26	which are also very important.
132.26	Simple in function,
134.26	but not at all simple in how they're constructed.
137.26	And the two here are just examples.
140.26	One is the cellphone, which we use every day.
143.26	And it rests on a complexity,
145.26	which has some characteristics
147.26	very different from those that my friend
149.26	Benoit Mandelbrot discussed,
151.26	but are very interesting.
153.26	And the other, of course, is a birth control pill,
156.26	which, in a very simple way,
158.26	fundamentally changed the structure of society
160.26	by changing the role of women in it
163.26	by providing to them
165.26	the opportunity to make reproductive choices.
170.26	So, there are two ways of thinking about this word, I think.
173.26	And here I've corrupted
175.26	the Potter Stewart quotation
178.26	by saying that we can think about something --
180.26	which spans all the way from scissors
182.26	to the cell phone,
184.26	Internet and birth control pills --
186.26	by saying that they're simple,
189.26	the functions are simple,
191.26	and we recognize what that simplicity is
193.26	when we see it.
195.26	Or there may be another way of doing it,
199.26	which is to think about the problem in terms of what --
202.26	if you associate with moral philosophers --
205.26	is called the teapot problem.
209.26	The teapot problem I'll pose this way.
212.26	Suppose you see a teapot,
214.26	and the teapot is
217.26	filled with hot water.
219.26	And you then ask the question:
221.26	Why is the water hot?
223.26	And that's a simple question.
225.26	It's like, what is simplicity?
227.26	One answer would be:
229.26	because the kinetic energy of the water molecules is high
231.26	and they bounce against things rapidly --
233.26	that's a kind of physical science argument.
236.26	A second argument would be:
238.26	because it was sitting on a stove with the flame on --
241.26	that's an historical argument.
243.26	A third is that I wanted hot water
245.26	for tea --
247.26	that's an intentional argument.
249.26	And, since this is coming from a moral philosopher,
251.26	the fourth would be that it's part of God's plan for the universe.
254.26	All of these are possibilities.
256.26	The point is that you get into trouble
259.26	when you ask a single question
261.26	with a single box for an answer,
263.26	in which that single question actually is many questions
266.26	with quite different meanings,
268.26	but with the same words.
271.26	"Asking, ""What is simplicity?"" I think falls in that category."
275.26	What is the state of science?
277.26	And, interestingly, complexity
279.26	is very highly evolved.
281.26	We have a lot of interesting information
283.26	about what complexity is.
285.26	Simplicity, for reasons
287.26	that are a little bit obscure,
289.26	is almost not pursued,
291.26	at least in the academic world.
293.26	We academics -- I am an academic --
295.26	we love complexity.
297.26	You can write papers about complexity,
299.26	and the nice thing about complexity is
301.26	it's fundamentally intractable in many ways,
303.26	so you're not responsible for outcomes. (Laughter)
306.26	Simplicity -- all of you really would like
309.26	your Waring Blender in the morning
311.26	to make whatever a Waring Blender does,
313.26	but not explode or play Beethoven.
316.26	You're not interested in the limits of these things.
319.26	So what one is interested in
321.26	has a lot to do with the rewards of the system.
324.26	And there's a lot of rewards in thinking
326.26	about complexity and emergence,
328.26	not so much in thinking about simplicity.
331.26	One of the things I want to do
333.26	is to help you with a very important task --
336.26	which you may not know that you have very often --
339.26	which is to understand
341.26	how to sit next to a physicist at a dinner party
344.26	and have a conversation. (Laughter)
346.26	And the words that I would like you to focus on
349.26	are complexity and emergence,
351.26	because these will enable you to start the conversation
354.26	and then daydream about other things.
356.26	(Laughter)
359.26	All right, what is complexity in this view of things,
362.26	and what is emergence?
364.26	We have, actually, a pretty good working definition of complexity.
367.26	It is a system, like traffic,
369.26	which has components.
371.26	The components interact with one another.
373.26	These are cars and drivers. They dissipate energy.
376.26	It turns out that, whenever you have that system,
378.26	weird stuff happens,
380.26	and you in Los Angeles
382.26	probably know this better than anyone.
385.26	Here's another example,
387.26	which I put up because
389.26	it's an example of really important current science.
392.26	You can't possibly read that. It's not intended that you read it,
395.26	but that's a tiny part
397.26	of the chemical reactions going on
399.26	in each of your cells at any given moment.
402.26	And it's like the traffic that you see.
405.26	The amazing thing about the cell is that
407.26	it actually does maintain a fairly stable
409.26	working relationship with other cells,
412.26	but we don't know why.
414.26	Anyone who tells you that we understand life,
416.26	walk away.
419.26	And let me reduce this to the simplest level.
422.26	We've heard from Bill Gates recently.
424.26	All of us, to some extent, study
426.26	this thing called a Bill Gates.
428.26	Terrific. You learn everything you can about that.
430.26	And then there's another kind of thing that you might study,
433.26	and you study that hard.
435.26	That's a Bono, this is a Bono.
437.26	But then, if you know everything you can know about those two things,
440.26	and you put them together,
442.26	what can you say about this combination?
444.26	The answer is, not a lot.
446.26	And that's complexity.
448.26	Now, imagine building that up to a city, or to a society,
451.26	and you've got, obviously, an interesting problem.
454.26	All right, so let me give you an example
457.26	of simplicity
459.26	of a particular kind.
461.26	And I want to introduce a word
463.26	that I think is very useful,
465.26	which is stacking.
467.26	And I'm going to use stacking for a kind of simplicity
470.26	that has the characteristic
472.26	that it is so simple
474.26	and so reliable
476.26	that I can build things with it.
478.26	Or I'm going to use simple to mean
480.26	reliable, predictable, repeatable.
485.26	And I'm going to use as an example the Internet,
487.26	because it's a particularly good example
489.26	of stacked simplicity.
492.26	We call it a complex system, which it is,
494.26	but it's also something else.
497.26	The Internet starts with mathematics,
500.26	it starts with binary.
502.26	And if you look at the list of things on the bottom,
505.26	we are familiar with the Arabic numbers
507.26	one to 10 and so on.
509.26	In binary, one is 0001,
512.26	seven is 0111.
515.26	The question is: Why is binary
517.26	simpler than Arabic?
519.26	And the answer is, simply,
521.26	that if I hold up three fingers, you can count that easily,
524.26	but if I hold up this,
526.26	it's sort of hard to say that I just did seven.
528.26	The virtue of binary is that it's the simplest possible way
531.26	of representing numbers.
533.26	Anything else is more complicated.
535.26	You can catch errors with it,
537.26	it's unambiguous in its reading,
539.26	there are lots of good things about binary.
541.26	So it is very, very simple
543.26	once you learn how to read it.
545.26	Now, if you like to represent
547.26	this zero and one of binary,
549.26	you need a device.
551.26	And think of things in your life
553.26	that are binary,
555.26	one of them is light switches.
557.26	They can be on and off. That's binary.
559.26	Now wall switches, we all know, fail.
563.26	But our friends who are condensed matter physicists
565.26	managed to come up, some 50 years ago,
568.26	with a very nice device, shown under that bell jar,
571.26	which is a transistor.
573.26	A transistor is nothing more than a wall switch.
575.26	It turns things on and off,
577.26	but it does so without moving parts
579.26	and it doesn't fail, basically, for a very long period of time.
582.26	So the second layer of simplicity
585.26	was the transistor in the Internet.
588.26	So, since the transistor is so simple,
591.26	you can put lots of them together.
593.26	And you put lots of them together and you come with
595.26	something called integrated circuits.
597.26	And a current integrated circuit
599.26	might have in each one of these chips
601.26	something like a billion transistors,
603.26	all of which have to work perfectly every time.
606.26	So that's the next layer of simplicity,
609.26	and, in fact, integrated circuits
611.26	are really simple in the sense that they,
613.26	in general, work really well.
615.26	With integrated circuits, you can build cellphones.
618.26	You all are accustomed to having your cellphones work
621.26	the large majority of the time.
623.26	In Boston ... Boston is a little bit like Namibia
625.26	in its cell phone coverage, (Laughter)
627.26	so that we're not accustomed to that all the time,
629.26	but some of the time.
632.26	But, in fact, if you have cell phones,
634.26	you can now go to this nice lady
636.26	who's somewhere like Namibia,
638.26	and who is extremely happy with the fact
640.26	that although she does not have
642.26	an master's degree in
644.26	electrical engineering from MIT,
646.26	she's nonetheless able to hack her cell phone
648.26	to get power in some funny way.
651.26	And from that comes the Internet.
653.26	And this is a map of bitflows across the continent.
656.26	The two blobs that are light in the middle there
659.26	are the United States and Europe.
661.26	And then back to simplicity again.
664.26	So here we have what I think is one of the great ideas,
667.26	which is Google.
669.26	Which, in this simple portal
671.26	makes the claim
673.26	that it makes accessible
675.26	all of the world's information.
677.26	But the point is that
679.26	that extraordinary simple idea
682.26	rests on layers of simplicity
685.26	each compounded into a complexity
687.26	that is itself simple,
689.26	in the sense that it is completely reliable.
693.26	All right, let me then finish off
695.26	with four general statements,
699.26	an example and two aphorisms.
702.26	The characteristics, which I think
704.26	are useful to think about for simple things:
707.26	First, they are predictable.
711.26	Their behavior is predictable.
713.26	Now, one of the nice characteristics
715.26	of simple things
717.26	is you know what it's going to do, in general.
719.26	So simplicity and predictability
721.26	are characteristics of simple things.
724.26	The second is, and this is a real world statement,
727.26	they're cheap.
729.26	If you have things that are cheap enough,
731.26	people will find uses for them,
733.26	even if they seem very primitive.
735.26	So, for example, stones.
737.26	You can build cathedrals out of stones,
740.26	you just have to know what it does.
742.26	You carve them in blocks and then you
744.26	pile them on top of one another,
746.26	and they support weight.
748.26	So there has to be function, the function has to be predictable
751.26	and the cost has to be low.
753.26	What that means is
755.26	that you have to have a high performance
757.26	or value for cost.
761.26	And then I would propose
763.26	as this last component
765.26	that they serve, or have the potential to serve,
768.26	as building blocks.
770.26	That is, you can stack them.
772.26	And stack can mean this way, or it can mean this way,
775.26	or it can mean in some arbitrary n-dimensional space.
778.26	But if you have something that has a function,
780.26	and it's really cheap,
782.26	people will find new ways of putting it together
784.26	to make new things.
786.26	Cheap, functional, reliable things
789.26	unleash the creativity of people
791.26	who then build stuff that you could not imagine.
794.26	There's no way of predicting the Internet
797.26	based on the first transistor.
799.26	It just is not possible.
801.26	So these are the components.
804.26	Now, the example
806.26	is something that I want to give you
808.26	from the work that we ourselves do.
811.26	We are very interested in
814.26	delivering health care in the developing world,
817.26	and one of the things that we wish to do in this particular business
820.26	is to find a way of doing medical diagnosis
823.26	at as close to zero cost
825.26	as we can manage.
827.26	So, how does one do that?
829.26	This is a world in which there's no electricity,
831.26	there's no money, there's no medical competence.
834.26	And I don't want to spend your time in going through the details,
837.26	but in the lower right-hand corner,
839.26	you see an example of the kind of thing that we have.
842.26	It's a little paper chip.
844.26	It has a few things printed on it
846.26	using the same technology
848.26	that you use for making comic books,
850.26	which was the inspiration for this particular idea.
853.26	And you put a drop, in this case, of urine at the bottom.
856.26	It wicks its way up into these little branches.
859.26	You know, no power required.
861.26	It turns colors. In this particular case,
863.26	you're reading kidney function.
866.26	And, since the health care worker
869.26	of much of this part of the world
871.26	is an 18 year-old with an AK-47,
874.26	who happens to be out of work and is willing
876.26	to go around and do this sort of thing,
878.26	he can take a picture of it with his cellphone,
880.26	send the picture back to where there is a doctor,
882.26	and the doctor can look at it.
884.26	So what you've done is to take a technology,
887.26	which is available everywhere,
889.26	make a device, which is extremely cheap,
892.26	and make it in such a fashion
894.26	that it is very, very reliable.
896.26	If we can pull this off,
898.26	if we can build more function,
900.26	it will be stackable.
902.26	That is to say, if we can make the basic technology
905.26	of one or two things work,
907.26	it will be applicable to a very, very
909.26	large variety of human conditions,
911.26	and hence, extendable in both
913.26	vertical and horizontal directions.
916.26	Part of my interest in this, I have to say,
918.26	is that I would like to -- how do I put this politely? --
921.26	change the way, or maybe eviscerate,
923.26	the capital structure of the U.S. health care system,
926.26	which I think is fundamentally broken.
929.26	So, let me close --
931.26	(Applause)
934.26	Let me close with my two aphorisms.
936.26	One of them is from Mr. Einstein,
938.26	"and he says, ""Everything should be made"
940.26	"as simple as possible, but not simpler."""
943.26	And I think that's a very good way of thinking about the problem.
946.26	If you take too much out
948.26	of something that's simple, you lose function.
950.26	You have to have low cost,
952.26	but you also have to have a function.
954.26	So you can't make it too simple.
956.26	And the second is a design issue,
958.26	and it's not directly relevant, but it's a nice statement.
961.26	This is by de Saint-Exupery.
964.26	"And he says, ""You know you've achieved perfection in design,"
967.26	not when you have nothing more to add,
970.26	"but when you have nothing more to take away."""
972.26	And that certainly is going in the right direction.
976.26	So, what I think one can begin to do
979.26	with this kind of
982.26	cut at the word simplicity,
984.26	which doesn't cover Brancusi,
986.26	it doesn't answer the question of
988.26	why Mondrian is better or worse
991.26	or simpler or less simpler than Van Gogh,
993.26	and certainly doesn't address the question
995.26	of whether Mozart is simpler than Bach.
998.26	But it does make a point --
1000.26	which is one which, in a sense,
1002.26	differentiates the real world of people who make things,
1005.26	and the world of people who think about things,
1008.26	which is, there is an intellectual merit
1011.26	to asking: How do we make things
1013.26	as simple as we can,
1015.26	as cheap as we can, as functional as we can
1018.26	and as freely interconnectable as we can?
1021.26	If we make that kind of simplicity in our technology
1024.26	and then give it to you guys,
1026.26	you can go off and do all kinds of fabulous things with it.
1029.26	Thank you very much.
1031.26	(Applause)
1040.26	Chris Anderson: Quick question.
1042.26	So can you picture
1045.26	that a science of simplicity
1047.26	might get to the point where
1049.26	you could look out at various systems --
1051.26	say a financial system or a legal system, health system -- and say,
1054.26	"""That has got to the point of danger"
1056.26	or dysfunctionality for the following reasons,
1058.26	"and this is how we might simplify it""?"
1060.26	George Whitesides: Yes, I think you could. Because if you look
1062.26	at the components from which the system is made
1064.26	and examine their fragility, or their stability,
1067.26	you can probably build a kind of risk assessment based on that basis.
1070.26	CA: Have you started to do that?
1072.26	I mean, with the health system, you got a sort of
1074.26	radical solution on the cost side,
1076.26	but in terms of the system itself?
1078.26	GW: Well, no.
1080.26	How do I put that simply? No.
1082.26	CA: That was a simple, powerful answer. GW: Yes.
1085.26	CA: So, in terms of
1087.26	that diagnostic technology that you've got,
1089.26	where is that, and when do you see that
1091.26	maybe getting rolled out to scale.
1093.26	GW: That's coming out soon. I mean, the systems work,
1096.26	and we have to find out how to manufacture them and do things of this kind,
