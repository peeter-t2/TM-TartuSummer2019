16.26	If you go on the TED website,
19.26	you can currently find there
21.26	over a full week of TEDTalk videos,
24.26	over 1.3 million
26.26	words of transcripts
28.26	and millions of user ratings.
30.26	And that's a huge amount of data.
33.26	And it got me wondering:
35.26	If you took all this data
37.26	and put it through statistical analysis,
39.26	could you reverse engineer a TEDTalk?
41.26	Could you create
43.26	the ultimate TEDTalk?
45.26	(Laughter) (Applause)
47.26	And also, could you create
49.26	the worst possible TEDTalk
51.26	that they would still let you get away with?
53.26	To find this out, I looked at three things:
55.26	I looked at the topic that you should choose,
57.26	I looked at how you should deliver it
60.26	and the visuals onstage.
62.26	Now, with the topic: There's a whole range of topics you can choose,
65.26	but you should choose wisely,
67.26	because your topic strongly correlates
69.26	with how users will react to your talk.
72.26	Now, to make this more concrete,
74.26	let's look at the list of top 10 words
77.26	that statistically stick out
79.26	in the most favorite TEDTalks
81.26	and in the least favorite TEDTalks.
84.26	So if you came here
86.26	to talk about how French coffee
88.26	will spread happiness in our brains,
91.26	that's a go.
93.26	(Laughter) (Applause)
95.26	Whereas, if you wanted to talk about
97.26	your project involving
99.26	oxygen, girls, aircraft --
101.26	actually, I would like to hear that talk, (Laughter)
103.26	but statistics say it's not so good.
105.26	Oh, well.
107.26	If you generalize this,
109.26	the most favorite TEDTalks are those
111.26	that feature topics we can connect with,
114.26	both easily and deeply,
116.26	such as happiness, our own body,
118.26	food, emotions.
120.26	And the more technical topics,
122.26	such as architecture, materials and, strangely enough, men,
125.26	those are not good topics to talk about.
128.26	How should you deliver your talk?
130.26	TED is famous for keeping
132.26	a very sharp eye on the clock,
134.26	so they're going to hate me
136.26	for revealing this, because, actually,
138.26	you should talk as long as they will let you. (Laughter)
140.26	Because the most favorite TEDTalks
143.26	are, on average, over 50 percent longer
145.26	than the least favorite ones.
148.26	And this holds true for all ranking lists on TED.com
150.26	except if you want to have a talk
152.26	that's beautiful, inspiring or funny.
154.26	Then, you should be brief. (Laughter) But other than that,
156.26	talk until they drag you off the stage.
159.26	(Laughter)
161.26	Now, while ...
163.26	(Applause)
169.26	While you're pushing the clock, there's a few rules to obey.
172.26	I found these rules out by comparing the statistics
174.26	of four-word phrases
176.26	that appear more often in the most favorite TEDTalks
179.26	as opposed to the least favorite TEDTalks.
181.26	I'll give you three examples.
183.26	First of all, I must, as a speaker,
185.26	provide a service to the audience and talk about what I will give you,
188.26	instead of saying what I can't have.
190.26	Secondly, it's imperative
192.26	that you do not cite The New York Times.
194.26	(Laughter)
196.26	And finally, it's okay for the speaker -- that's the good news --
199.26	to fake intellectual capacity.
201.26	"If I don't understand something, I can just say, ""etc., etc."""
204.26	You'll all stay with me.
206.26	It's perfectly fine.
208.26	(Applause)
212.26	Now, let's go to the visuals.
214.26	The most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker.
217.26	And analysis shows if you want to be
219.26	among the most favorite TED speakers,
221.26	you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average,
224.26	make sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dressed-up
227.26	than the average TED speaker.
229.26	Slides are okay, though you might consider going for props.
232.26	And now the most important thing,
234.26	that is the mood onstage.
236.26	Color plays a very important role.
238.26	Color closely correlates
240.26	with the ratings that talks get on the website.
243.26	(Applause)
245.26	For example, fascinating talks
247.26	contain a statistically high amount
249.26	of exactly this blue color, (Laughter)
251.26	much more than the average TEDTalk.
253.26	Ingenious TEDTalks, much more this green color,
255.26	etc., et.
257.26	(Laughter) (Applause)
264.26	Now, personally, I think
266.26	I'm not the first one who has done this analysis,
268.26	but I'll leave this
270.26	to your good judgment.
273.26	So, now it's time to put it all together
275.26	and design the ultimate TEDTalk.
277.26	Now, since this is TEDActive,
279.26	and I learned from my analysis
281.26	that I should actually give you something,
283.26	I will not impose the ultimate
285.26	or worst TEDTalk on you,
287.26	but rather give you a tool to create your own.
289.26	And I call this tool the TEDPad.
292.26	(Laughter)
295.26	And the TEDPad is a matrix
297.26	of 100 specifically selected,
299.26	highly curated sentences
302.26	that you can easily piece together to get your own TEDTalk.
307.26	You only have to make one decision,
309.26	and that is: Are you going to use the white version
311.26	for very good TEDTalks,
313.26	about creativity, human genius?
315.26	Or are you going to go with a black version,
317.26	which will allow you to create really bad TEDTalks,
319.26	mostly about blogs,
321.26	politics and stuff?
323.26	So, download it and have fun with it.
325.26	Now I hope you enjoy the session.
328.26	I hope you enjoy designing your own
330.26	ultimate and worst possible TEDTalks.
332.26	And I hope some of you will be inspired for next year
335.26	to create this, which I really want to see.
338.26	Thank you very much.
340.26	(Applause) Thanks.
