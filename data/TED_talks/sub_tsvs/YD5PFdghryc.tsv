12.914	As a little girl, I always imagined
15.211	I would one day run away.
17.546	From the age of six on,
19.01	I kept a packed bag with some clothes
21.462	and cans of food tucked away
22.988	in the back of a closet.
24.982	There was a deep restlessness in me,
27.604	a primal fear that I would fall prey
30.15	to a life of routine and boredom.
32.925	And so, many of my early memories involved
35.534	intricate daydreams where
35.534	I would walk across borders,
39.1	forage for berries,
40.468	and meet all kinds of strange people
42.532	living unconventional lives on the road.
45.576	Years have passed, but many of the adventures
48.16	I fantasized about as a child --
50.927	traveling and weaving my way
52.524	between worlds other than my own â€”
54.524	have become realities through my work
56.124	as a documentary photographer.
58.685	But no other experience has felt as true
61.82	to my childhood dreams
63.74	as living amongst and documenting the lives
66.458	of fellow wanderers across the United States.
71.15	This is the nomadic dream,
73.91	a different kind of American dream
75.82	lived by young hobos, travelers,
78.464	hitchhikers, vagrants and tramps.
81.848	In most of our minds,
83.197	the vagabond is a creature from the past.
86.288	"The word ""hobo"" conjures up an old"
88.591	black and white image
90.028	of a weathered old man covered in coal,
92.534	legs dangling out of a boxcar,
94.935	but these photographs are in color,
97.047	and they portray a community
98.83	swirling across the country,
100.552	fiercely alive and creatively free,
103.377	seeing sides of America that no one else
105.876	gets to see.
108.066	Like their predecessors, today's nomads
110.756	travel the steel and asphalt arteries
113.423	of the United States.
115.112	By day, they hop freight trains,
115.112	stick out their thumbs,
118.3	and ride the highways with anyone
120.154	from truckers to soccer moms.
123.17	By night, they sleep beneath the stars,
125.496	huddled together with their packs of dogs,
128.178	cats and pet rats between their bodies.
131.886	Some travelers take to the road by choice,
134.514	renouncing materialism, traditional jobs
137.1	and university degrees in exchange 
137.1	for a glimmer of adventure.
141.034	Others come from the underbelly of society,
144.284	never given a chance to mobilize upwards:
147.324	foster care dropouts, teenage runaways escaping
150.7	abuse and unforgiving homes.
153.844	Where others see stories of privation
156.754	and economic failure,
158.834	travelers view their own existence
160.694	through the prism of liberation and freedom.
164.267	They'd rather live off of the excess
166.482	of what they view as a wasteful consumer society
169.432	than slave away at an unrealistic chance
172.233	at the traditional American dream.
174.912	They take advantage of the fact
177.001	that in the United States,
178.549	up to 40 percent of all food ends up in the garbage
182.37	by scavenging for perfectly good produce
185.003	in dumpsters and trash cans.
187.677	They sacrifice material comforts in exchange
190.046	for the space and the time to explore
192.769	a creative interior,
194.491	to dream, to read, to work on music, art and writing.
199.373	But there are many aspects to this life
201.881	that are far from idyllic.
204.244	No one loses their inner demons
206.367	by taking to the road.
208.076	Addiction is real, the elements are real,
211.238	freight trains maim and kill,
213.45	and anyone who has lived on the streets can attest
216.11	to the exhaustive list of laws
218	that criminalize homeless existence.
222.106	Who here knows that in many cities
223.936	across the United States it is now illegal
226.586	to sit on the sidewalk,
228.619	to wrap oneself in a blanket,
232.006	to sleep in your own car,
234.741	to offer food to a stranger?
238.1	I know about these laws because I've watched
239.872	as friends and other travelers
241.664	were hauled off to jail or received citations
244.334	for committing these so-called crimes.
247.922	Many of you might be wondering why anyone
250.083	would choose a life like this,
251.794	under the thumb of discriminatory laws,
254.16	eating out of trash cans,
255.478	sleeping under bridges,
257.267	picking up seasonal jobs here and there.
260.518	The answer to such a question is as varied
263.032	as the people that take to the road,
265.568	but travelers often respond with a single word:
268.95	freedom.
271.281	Until we live in a society where every human
274.794	is assured dignity in their labor
276.863	so that they can work to live well,
278.738	not only work to survive,
280.845	there will always be an element of those
282.762	who seek the open road as a means of escape,
285.894	of liberation and, of course, of rebellion.
290.952	Thank you.
292.968	(Applause)
