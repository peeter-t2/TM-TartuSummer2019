12.499	In the spring of 2016,
15.046	a legal battle between Apple
15.046	and the Federal Bureau of Investigation
19.474	captured the world's attention.
21.633	Apple has built security features
21.633	into its mobile products
24.996	which protect data on its devices
24.996	from everyone but the owner.
28.853	That means that criminals, hackers
28.853	and yes, even governments
33.522	are all locked out.
35.58	For Apple's customers,
35.58	this is a great thing.
38.581	But governments are not so happy.
41.152	You see, Apple has made
41.152	a conscious decision
43.493	to get out of the surveillance business.
46.077	Apple has tried to make surveillance
46.077	as difficult as possible
49.312	for governments and any other actors.
53.676	There are really two
53.676	smartphone operating systems
56.03	in the global smartphone market:
57.682	iOS and Android.
59.749	iOS is made by Apple.
59.749	Android is made by Google.
63.446	Apple has spent a lot of time and money
66.594	to make sure that its products
66.594	are as secure as possible.
70.458	Apple encrypts all data
70.458	stored on iPhones by default,
73.916	and text messages sent from one
73.916	Apple customer to another Apple customer
77.946	are encrypted by default
79.672	without the user having
79.672	to take any actions.
82.769	What this means is that,
84.404	if the police seize an iPhone
84.404	and it has a password,
88.724	they'll have a difficult time
88.724	getting any data off of it,
92.39	if they can do it at all.
94.374	In contrast, the security of Android
94.374	just really isn't as good.
98.536	Android phones, or at least
98.536	most of the Android phones
101.606	that have been sold to consumers,
103.236	do not encrypt data stored
103.236	on the device by default,
106.115	and the built-in text messaging app
106.115	in Android does not use encryption.
111.555	So if the police seize an Android phone,
114.273	chances are, they'll be able to get
114.273	all the data they want
117.654	off of that device.
119.858	Two smartphones
121.568	from two of the biggest
121.568	companies in the world;
124.497	one that protects data by default,
126.948	and one that doesn't.
128.84	Apple is a seller of luxury goods.
132.006	It dominates the high end of the market.
134.71	And we would expect a manufacturer
134.71	of luxury goods to have products
139.088	that include more features.
141.567	But not everyone can afford an iPhone.
143.998	That's where Android
143.998	really, really dominates:
146.609	at the middle and low end of the market,
149.384	smartphones for the billion
149.384	and a half people
152.034	who cannot or will not spend
161.275	But the dominance of Android
161.275	has led to what I call
167.129	"the ""digital security divide."""
169.365	That is, there is now increasingly a gap
172.374	between the privacy
172.374	and security of the rich,
176.523	who can afford devices
176.523	that secure their data by default,
180.036	and of the poor,
181.851	whose devices do very little
181.851	to protect them by default.
187.667	So, think of the average Apple customer:
192.013	a banker, a lawyer,
192.013	a doctor, a politician.
197.387	These individuals now increasingly have
197.387	smartphones in their pockets
202.665	that encrypt their calls,
202.665	their text messages,
206.162	all the data on the device,
207.721	without them doing really anything
207.721	to secure their information.
212.904	In contrast, the poor
212.904	and the most vulnerable in our societies
216.973	are using devices that leave them
216.973	completely vulnerable to surveillance.
223.065	In the United States, where I live,
225.078	African-Americans are more likely
225.078	to be seen as suspicious
229.051	or more likely to be profiled,
231.64	and are more likely to be targeted
231.64	by the state with surveillance.
236.008	But African-Americans
236.008	are also disproportionately likely
238.821	to use Android devices
238.821	that do nothing at all
241.941	to protect them from that surveillance.
244.974	This is a problem.
247.536	We must remember
247.536	that surveillance is a tool.
250.81	It's a tool used by those in power
253.934	against those who have no power.
257.173	And while I think it's absolutely great
261.947	that companies like Apple
261.947	are making it easy for people to encrypt,
266.355	if the only people
266.355	who can protect themselves
270.194	from the gaze of the government
271.709	are the rich and powerful,
273.741	that's a problem.
275.549	And it's not just a privacy
275.549	or a cybersecurity problem.
279.739	It's a civil rights problem.
282.806	So the lack of default security in Android
285.697	is not just a problem
285.697	for the poor and vulnerable users
291.1	who are depending on these devices.
293.342	This is actually a problem
293.342	for our democracy.
296.237	I'll explain what I mean.
298.514	Modern social movements
298.514	rely on technology --
301.413	from Black Lives Matter to the Arab Spring
301.413	to Occupy Wall Street.
307.238	The organizers of these movements
307.238	and the members of these movements
311.237	increasingly communicate
311.237	and coordinate with smartphones.
316.446	And so, naturally governments
316.446	that feel threatened by these movements
320.321	will also target the organizers
320.321	and their smartphones.
325.462	Now, it's quite possible
327.56	that a future Martin Luther King
327.56	or a Mandela or a Gandhi
331.648	will have an iPhone and be protected
331.648	from government surveillance.
336.283	But chances are,
337.854	they'll probably have a cheap,
337.854	$20 Android phone in their pocket.
342.676	And so if we do nothing
342.676	to address the digital security divide,
346.521	if we do nothing to ensure
346.521	that everyone in our society
351.167	gets the same benefits of encryption
353.476	and is equally able to protect themselves
353.476	from surveillance by the state,
357.157	not only will the poor and vulnerable
357.157	be exposed to surveillance,
362.404	but future civil rights
362.404	movements may be crushed
365.369	before they ever reach
365.369	their full potential.
367.813	Thank you.
369.004	(Applause)
375.94	Helen Walters: Chris, thank you so much.
377.89	I have a question for you.
379.786	We saw recently in the press
381.663	that Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook
381.663	covers over his camera
387.191	and does something
387.191	with his headphone mic jack.
390.189	So I wanted to ask you
390.189	a personal question, which is:
392.758	Do you do that?
393.934	And, on behalf of everyone
393.934	here, particularly myself,
396.537	Should we be doing that?
397.886	Should we be covering these things?
399.678	Christopher Soghoian: Putting a sticker --
399.678	actually, I like Band-Aids,
403.863	because you can remove them
403.863	and put them back on
406.152	whenever you want to make
406.152	a call or a Skype call.
408.488	Putting a sticker over your web cam
410.214	is probably the best thing
410.214	you can do for your privacy
412.914	in terms of bang for buck.
414.444	There really is malware,
414.444	malicious software out there
418.365	that can take over your web cam,
420.246	even without the light turning on.
422.14	This is used by criminals.
422.14	This is used by stalkers.
425.333	"You can buy $19.99 ""spy"
425.333	"on your ex-girlfriend"" software online."
430.295	It's really terrifying.
431.47	And then, of course,
431.47	it's used by governments.
434.018	And there's obviously
434.018	a sexual violence component to this,
437.263	which is that this kind of surveillance
437.263	can be used most effectively
440.988	against women and other people
440.988	who can be shamed in our society.
448.417	Even if you think
448.417	you have nothing to hide,
450.549	at the very least, if you have
450.549	children, teenagers in your lives,
455.131	make sure you put a sticker
455.131	on their camera and protect them.
458.165	HW: Wow. Thank you so much.
458.165	CS: Thank you.
460.183	HW: Thanks, Chris.
461.358	(Applause)
