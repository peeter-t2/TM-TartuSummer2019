13.063	There's an old joke about a cop
14.602	who's walking his beat
14.602	in the middle of the night,
16.983	and he comes across a guy
16.983	under a street lamp
19.11	who's looking at the ground
19.11	and moving from side to side,
21.825	and the cop asks him what he's doing.
23.626	The guys says he's looking for his keys.
25.584	So the cop takes his time
27.047	and looks over and kind of
27.047	makes a little matrix
29.341	and looks for about two, three minutes.
31.57	No keys.
32.745	"The cop says, ""Are you sure?"
35.141	Hey buddy, are you sure
35.141	"you lost your keys here?"""
37.474	And the guy says,
37.474	"""No, actually I lost them"
39.53	down at the other end of the street,
41.28	"but the light is better here."""
42.749	(Laughter)
46.167	There's a concept that people talk
46.167	"about nowadays called ""big data."""
49.434	And what they're talking
49.434	about is all of the information
52.101	that we're generating
52.101	through our interaction
54.276	with and over the Internet,
55.603	everything from Facebook and Twitter
57.387	to music downloads, movies,
57.387	streaming, all this kind of stuff,
61.044	the live streaming of TED.
62.919	And the folks who work
62.919	with big data, for them,
65.627	they talk about that their biggest problem
67.655	is we have so much information.
69.426	The biggest problem is: how do we
69.426	organize all that information?
73.272	I can tell you that,
73.272	working in global health,
75.456	that is not our biggest problem.
78.232	Because for us, even though
78.232	the light is better on the Internet,
82.989	the data that would help us solve
82.989	the problems we're trying to solve
86.379	is not actually present on the Internet.
88.552	So we don't know, for example,
90.021	how many people right now
90.021	are being affected by disasters
93.336	or by conflict situations.
95.329	We don't know for, really,
95.329	basically, any of the clinics
99.072	in the developing world,
100.246	which ones have medicines
100.246	and which ones don't.
102.725	We have no idea of what
102.725	the supply chain is for those clinics.
106.123	We don't know -- and this is really
106.123	amazing to me -- we don't know
109.845	how many children were born --
109.845	or how many children there are --
113.639	in Bolivia or Botswana or Bhutan.
118.047	We don't know how many kids died last week
120.112	in any of those countries.
121.382	We don't know the needs
121.382	of the elderly, the mentally ill.
124.453	For all of these different
124.453	critically important problems
127.692	or critically important areas
127.692	that we want to solve problems in,
131.016	we basically know nothing at all.
135.834	And part of the reason
135.834	why we don't know anything at all
138.51	is that the information technology systems
138.51	that we use in global health
142.713	to find the data to solve
142.713	these problems is what you see here.
147.15	This is about a 5,000-year-old technology.
149.408	Some of you may have used it before.
151.164	It's kind of on its way out now,
152.727	but we still use it
152.727	for 99 percent of our stuff.
155.19	This is a paper form.
158.01	And what you're looking at is a paper form
160.067	in the hand of a Ministry of Health
160.067	nurse in Indonesia,
163.27	who is tramping out across the countryside
165.534	in Indonesia on, I'm sure,
165.534	a very hot and humid day,
169.209	and she is going to be knocking
169.209	on thousands of doors
171.915	over a period of weeks or months,
174.018	knocking on the doors and saying,
175.639	"""Excuse me, we'd like to ask"
175.639	you some questions.
178.541	Do you have any children?
178.541	"Were your children vaccinated?"""
182.223	Because the only way
182.223	we can actually find out
184.382	how many children were vaccinated
184.382	in the country of Indonesia,
187.341	what percentage were vaccinated,
188.922	is actually not on the Internet,
188.922	but by going out and knocking on doors,
193.074	sometimes tens of thousands of doors.
195.312	Sometimes it takes months to even years
195.312	to do something like this.
199.334	You know, a census of Indonesia
201.475	would probably take
201.475	two years to accomplish.
203.593	And the problem, of course,
203.593	with all of this
205.689	is that, with all those paper forms --
207.61	and I'm telling you, we have
207.61	paper forms for every possible thing:
210.753	We have paper forms
210.753	for vaccination surveys.
212.841	We have paper forms to track
212.841	people who come into clinics.
216.026	We have paper forms to track
216.026	drug supplies, blood supplies --
220.092	all these different paper forms
220.092	for many different topics,
223.35	they all have a single, common endpoint,
225.69	and the common endpoint
225.69	looks something like this.
228.333	And what we're looking
228.333	at here is a truckful of data.
233.261	This is the data from a single
233.261	vaccination coverage survey
237.15	in a single district
237.15	in the country of Zambia
239.365	from a few years ago,
239.365	that I participated in.
241.679	The only thing anyone
241.679	was trying to find out
244.05	is what percentage of Zambian
244.05	children are vaccinated,
247.327	and this is the data,
247.327	collected on paper over weeks,
250.605	from a single district,
251.812	which is something like a county
251.812	in the United States.
254.511	You can imagine that,
254.511	for the entire country of Zambia,
257.21	answering just that single question ...
260.615	looks something like this.
263.072	Truck after truck after truck,
265.136	filled with stack after stack
265.136	after stack of data.
268.43	And what makes it even worse
268.43	is that's just the beginning.
271.666	Because once you've collected
271.666	all that data,
273.784	of course, someone --
273.784	some unfortunate person --
276.348	is going to have to type that
276.348	into a computer.
278.587	When I was a graduate student,
280.063	I actually was that unfortunate
280.063	person sometimes.
282.546	I can tell you, I often wasn't
282.546	really paying attention.
285.585	I probably made a lot
285.585	of mistakes when I did it
287.876	that no one ever discovered,
287.876	so data quality goes down.
290.52	But eventually that data, hopefully,
290.52	gets typed into a computer,
293.564	and someone can begin to analyze it,
295.319	and once they have
295.319	an analysis and a report,
298.215	hopefully, then you can take
298.215	the results of that data collection
301.263	and use it to vaccinate children better.
303.254	Because if there's anything worse
303.254	in the field of global public health --
308.819	I don't know what's worse
308.819	than allowing children on this planet
311.825	to die of vaccine-preventable diseases --
314.679	diseases for which
314.679	the vaccine costs a dollar.
317.835	And millions of children die
317.835	of these diseases every year.
321.211	And the fact is, millions
321.211	is a gross estimate,
324.209	because we don't really know
324.209	how many kids die each year of this.
327.73	What makes it even more frustrating
327.73	is that the data-entry part,
331.253	the part that I used to do
331.253	as a grad student,
333.467	can take sometimes six months.
334.949	Sometimes it can take two years
334.949	to type that information into a computer,
338.425	And sometimes, actually not infrequently,
340.559	it actually never happens.
342.411	Now try and wrap your head
342.411	around that for a second.
344.911	You just had teams of hundreds of people.
347.11	They went out into the field
347.11	to answer a particular question.
350.037	You probably spent hundreds
350.037	of thousands of dollars
352.457	on fuel and photocopying and per diem.
356.072	And then for some reason, momentum is lost
358.14	or there's no money left,
359.557	and all of that comes to nothing,
361.918	because no one actually types it
361.918	into the computer at all.
364.665	The process just stops.
365.865	Happens all the time.
367.813	This is what we base
367.813	our decisions on in global health:
370.952	little data, old data, no data.
375.924	So back in 1995,
377.401	I began to think about ways
377.401	in which we could improve this process.
380.665	Now 1995 -- obviously,
380.665	that was quite a long time ago.
383.357	It kind of frightens me to think
383.357	of how long ago that was.
386.359	The top movie of the year
386.359	"was ""Die Hard with a Vengeance."""
389.121	As you can see, Bruce Willis
389.121	had a lot more hair back then.
391.962	I was working in the Centers
391.962	for Disease Control
394.651	and I had a lot more
394.651	hair back then as well.
397.505	But to me, the most significant
397.505	thing that I saw in 1995
400.473	was this.
402.151	Hard for us to imagine, but in 1995,
404.568	this was the ultimate elite mobile device.
408.286	It wasn't an iPhone.
408.286	It wasn't a Galaxy phone.
410.866	It was a PalmPilot.
412.254	And when I saw the PalmPilot
412.254	for the first time, I thought,
415.806	"""Why can't we put the forms"
415.806	on these PalmPilots?
418.758	And go out into the field
418.758	just carrying one PalmPilot,
421.402	which can hold the capacity
421.402	of tens of thousands of paper forms?
425.191	Why don't we try to do that?
426.642	Because if we can do that,
427.929	if we can actually just collect
427.929	the data electronically, digitally,
431.762	from the very beginning,
433.443	we can just put a shortcut right
433.443	through that whole process
436.743	of typing, of having somebody type
436.743	that stuff into the computer.
441.759	We can skip straight to the analysis
443.623	and then straight to the use
443.623	"of the data to actually save lives."""
446.786	So that's what I began to do.
449.397	Working at CDC, I began to travel
449.397	to different programs around the world
453.77	and to train them in using
453.77	PalmPilots to do data collection,
457.936	instead of using paper.
459.338	And it actually worked great.
461.25	It worked exactly as well
461.25	as anybody would have predicted.
464.326	What do you know?
465.507	Digital data collection is actually
465.507	more efficient than collecting on paper.
469.143	While I was doing it, my business partner,
471.199	Rose, who's here with her husband,
471.199	Matthew, here in the audience,
474.302	Rose was out doing similar stuff
474.302	for the American Red Cross.
477.199	The problem was,
477.199	after a few years of doing that,
479.609	I realized -- I had been to maybe
479.609	six or seven programs --
483.53	and I thought, you know,
483.53	if I keep this up at this pace,
486.815	over my whole career,
487.99	maybe I'm going to go
487.99	to maybe 20 or 30 programs.
490.693	But the problem is, 20 or 30 programs,
493.86	like, training 20 or 30 programs
493.86	to use this technology,
496.834	that is a tiny drop in the bucket.
499.024	The demand for this, the need
499.024	for data to run better programs
502.988	just within health -- not to mention
502.988	all of the other fields
505.87	in developing countries -- is enormous.
507.89	There are millions and millions
507.89	and millions of programs,
511.9	millions of clinics
511.9	that need to track drugs,
514.492	millions of vaccine programs.
515.92	There are schools
515.92	that need to track attendance.
518.205	There are all these different things
518.205	for us to get the data that we need to do.
522.135	And I realized if I kept up
522.135	the way that I was doing,
526.778	I was basically hardly
526.778	going to make any impact
530.022	by the end of my career.
531.756	And so I began to rack my brain,
533.648	trying to think about, what
533.648	was the process that I was doing?
536.616	How was I training folks,
537.922	and what were the bottlenecks
537.922	and what were the obstacles
541.12	to doing it faster
541.12	and to doing it more efficiently?
543.839	And, unfortunately, after thinking
543.839	about this for some time,
546.699	I identified the main obstacle.
550.475	And the main obstacle, it turned out --
552.42	and this is a sad realization --
554.032	the main obstacle was me.
556.229	So what do I mean by that?
558.538	I had developed a process
560.278	whereby I was the center
560.278	of the universe of this technology.
566.304	If you wanted to use this technology,
566.304	you had to get in touch with me.
569.651	That means you had to know I existed.
571.499	Then you had to find the money
571.499	to pay for me to fly out to your country
574.936	and the money to pay for my hotel
574.936	and my per diem and my daily rate.
578.555	So you could be talking
578.555	about 10- or 20- or 30,000 dollars,
581.578	if I actually had the time
581.578	or it fit my schedule
583.896	and I wasn't on vacation.
585.594	The point is that anything,
587.579	any system that depends
587.579	on a single human being
589.966	or two or three or five human beings --
591.893	it just doesn't scale.
593.57	And this is a problem for which
593.57	we need to scale this technology,
596.793	and we need to scale it now.
598.387	And so I began to think of ways
598.387	in which I could basically
601.165	take myself out of the picture.
606.071	And, you know, I was thinking,
607.739	"""How could I take myself"
607.739	"out of the picture?"""
609.867	for quite some time.
611.51	I'd been trained that the way
611.51	you distribute technology
615.01	within international development
616.59	is always consultant-based.
618.176	It's always guys
618.176	that look pretty much like me,
621.201	flying from countries
621.201	that look pretty much like this
623.773	to other countries
623.773	with people with darker skin.
626.769	And you go out there,
626.769	and you spend money on airfare
629.255	and you spend time and you spend per diem
632.515	and you spend for a hotel
632.515	and all that stuff.
634.888	As far as I knew, that was the only way
634.888	you could distribute technology,
638.324	and I couldn't figure out a way around it.
640.383	But the miracle that happened --
642.851	I'm going to call it Hotmail for short.
645.168	You may not think of Hotmail
645.168	as being miraculous,
647.615	but for me it was miraculous,
649.076	because I noticed, just as I
649.076	was wrestling with this problem --
652.712	I was working in sub-Saharan
652.712	Africa, mostly, at the time --
656.242	I noticed that every sub-Saharan
656.242	African health worker
658.831	that I was working with
658.831	had a Hotmail account.
663.389	"And it struck me, ""Wait a minute --"
666.341	I know the Hotmail people surely didn't
666.341	fly to the Ministry of Health in Kenya
670.603	to train people in how to use Hotmail.
673.382	So these guys are distributing technology,
673.382	getting software capacity out there,
677.654	but they're not actually
677.654	flying around the world.
680.006	"I need to think about this more."""
681.602	While I was thinking about it,
683.076	people started using even more
683.076	things like this, just as we were.
686.259	They started using LinkedIn and Flickr
686.259	and Gmail and Google Maps --
689.514	all these things.
690.695	Of course, all of these things
690.695	are cloud based
693.41	and don't require any training.
695.583	They don't require any programmers.
697.283	They don't require consultants.
698.81	Because the business model
698.81	for all these businesses
701.319	requires that something be so simple
701.319	we can use it ourselves,
704.28	with little or no training.
705.598	You just have to hear about it
705.598	and go to the website.
708.217	And so I thought, what would happen
708.217	if we built software
712.437	to do what I'd been consulting in?
714.525	Instead of training people
714.525	how to put forms onto mobile devices,
718.621	let's create software that lets them
718.621	do it themselves with no training
721.946	and without me being involved.
723.406	And that's exactly what we did.
724.914	So we created software called Magpi,
724.914	which has an online form creator.
730.159	No one has to speak to me,
731.435	you just have to hear about it
731.435	and go to the website.
734.26	You can create forms,
734.26	and once you've created the forms,
736.942	you push them to a variety
736.942	of common mobile phones.
739.427	Obviously, nowadays, we've moved
739.427	past PalmPilots to mobile phones.
742.968	And it doesn't have to be a smartphone,
742.968	it can be a basic phone,
746.221	like the phone on the right,
746.221	the basic Symbian phone
748.735	that's very common
748.735	in developing countries.
750.821	And the great part about this
750.821	is it's just like Hotmail.
754.534	It's cloud based,
755.709	and it doesn't require any training,
755.709	programming, consultants.
758.986	But there are some
758.986	additional benefits as well.
761.213	Now we knew when we built this system,
763.11	the whole point of it,
763.11	just like with the PalmPilots,
765.689	was that you'd be able to collect the data
768.512	and immediately upload
768.512	the data and get your data set.
771.134	But what we found, of course,
771.134	since it's already on a computer,
774.143	we can deliver instant maps
774.143	and analysis and graphing.
776.778	We can take a process that took two years
778.873	and compress that
778.873	down to the space of five minutes.
782.222	Unbelievable improvements in efficiency.
784.74	Cloud based, no training,
784.74	no consultants, no me.
789.52	And I told you that in the first few years
791.815	of trying to do this
791.815	the old-fashioned way,
793.908	going out to each country,
795.211	we probably trained about 1,000 people.
799.871	What happened after we did this?
801.577	In the second three years,
803.062	we had 14,000 people find the website,
805.236	sign up and start using it
805.236	to collect data:
807.373	data for disaster response,
809.307	Canadian pig farmers
809.307	tracking pig disease and pig herds,
813.765	people tracking drug supplies.
816.241	One of my favorite examples, the IRC,
816.241	International Rescue Committee,
819.609	they have a program
819.609	where semi-literate midwives,
822.846	using $10 mobile phones,
825.273	send a text message
825.273	using our software, once a week,
828.598	with the number of births
828.598	and the number of deaths,
831.098	which gives IRC something that no one
831.098	in global health has ever had:
834.694	a near-real-time system
834.694	of counting babies,
838.24	of knowing how many kids are born,
839.898	of knowing how many children
839.898	there are in Sierra Leone,
842.564	which is the country
842.564	where this is happening,
844.811	and knowing how many children die.
847.394	Physicians for Human Rights --
848.991	this is moving a little bit
848.991	outside the health field --
851.607	they're basically training people
851.607	to do rape exams in Congo,
856.414	where this is an epidemic,
857.887	a horrible epidemic,
859.704	and they're using our software
859.704	to document the evidence they find,
862.904	including photographically,
864.902	so that they can bring
864.902	the perpetrators to justice.
868.956	Camfed, another charity
868.956	based out of the UK --
872.573	Camfed pays girls' families
872.573	to keep them in school.
876.165	They understand this is the most
876.165	significant intervention they can make.
879.664	They used to track the disbursements,
879.664	the attendance, the grades, on paper.
883.528	The turnaround time between a teacher
883.528	writing down grades or attendance
886.899	and getting that into a report
886.899	was about two to three years.
889.758	Now it's real time.
890.933	And because this is such a low-cost
890.933	system and based in the cloud,
894.14	it costs, for the entire five countries
894.14	that Camfed runs this in,
898.153	with tens of thousands of girls,
900.042	the whole cost combined
900.042	is 10,000 dollars a year.
903.154	That's less than I used to get
905.139	just traveling out for two weeks
905.139	to do a consultation.
910.139	So I told you before that when
910.139	we were doing it the old-fashioned way,
913.632	I realized all of our work was really
913.632	adding up to just a drop in the bucket --
920.036	We've made a lot of progress,
921.473	but I recognize that right now,
923.053	even the work that we've done
923.053	with 14,000 people using this
926.441	is still a drop in the bucket.
927.928	But something's changed,
927.928	and I think it should be obvious.
930.682	What's changed now is,
932.861	instead of having a program
932.861	in which we're scaling at such a slow rate
936.187	that we can never reach
936.187	all the people who need us,
939.522	we've made it unnecessary
939.522	for people to get reached by us.
943.128	We've created a tool
943.128	that lets programs keep kids in school,
948.155	track the number of babies that are born
948.155	and the number of babies that die,
952.118	catch criminals and successfully
952.118	prosecute them --
955.919	to do all these different things
955.919	to learn more about what's going on,
960.365	to understand more,
961.69	to see more ...
963.911	and to save lives and improve lives.
967.92	Thank you.
