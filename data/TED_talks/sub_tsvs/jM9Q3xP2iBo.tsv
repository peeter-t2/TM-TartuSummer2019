12.842	What is a parent?
15.999	What is a parent?
19.043	It's not an easy question.
21.63	Today we have adoption,
24.028	stepfamilies,
25.628	surrogate mothers.
27.846	Many parents face tough questions
31.151	and tough decisions.
33.888	Shall we tell our child
33.888	about the sperm donation?
39.322	If so, when?
41.176	What words to use?
43.522	Sperm donors are often referred
43.522	"to as ""biological fathers,"""
49.407	but should we really
49.407	"be using the word ""father?"""
53.843	As a philosopher and social scientist,
56.272	I have been studying these questions
56.272	about the concept of parenthood.
61.088	But today, I will talk to you
61.088	about what I learned
64.14	from talking to parents and children.
67.377	I will show you that they know
67.377	what matters most in a family,
71.755	even though their family
71.755	looks a little different.
75.133	I will show you their creative ways
75.133	of dealing with tough questions.
81.287	But I will also show you
81.287	the parents' uncertainties.
87.284	We interviewed couples
88.839	who received fertility treatment
88.839	at Ghent University Hospital,
93.075	using sperm from a donor.
95.183	In this treatment timeline,
96.774	you can see two points
96.774	at which we conducted interviews.
100.994	We included heterosexual couples,
104.055	where the man for some reason
104.055	did not have good-quality sperm,
108.435	and lesbian couples who obviously
108.435	needed to find sperm elsewhere.
114.996	We also included children.
118.878	I wanted to know
120.385	how those children define concepts
120.385	like parenthood and family.
126.15	In fact, that is what I asked them,
130.259	only not in that way.
133.437	I drew an apple tree instead.
137.056	This way, I could ask abstract,
137.056	philosophical questions
140.427	in a way that did not make them run off.
145.332	So as you can see,
147.008	the apple tree is empty.
149.63	And that illustrates my research approach.
152.659	By designing techniques like this,
154.966	I can bring as little meaning and content
154.966	as possible to the interview,
160.533	because I want to hear that from them.
164.362	I asked them:
166.738	What would your family look like
166.738	if it were an apple tree?
170.739	And they could take a paper apple
170.739	for everyone who, in their view,
174.513	was a member of the family,
176.144	write a name on it
176.144	and hang it wherever they wanted.
179.342	And I would ask questions.
182.153	Most children started
182.153	with a parent or a sibling.
185.806	"One started with ""Boxer,"""
188.667	the dead dog of his grandparents.
191.83	At this point, none of the children
191.83	started mentioning the donor.
196.465	So, I asked them about their birth story.
201.161	"I said, ""Before you were born,"
203.207	it was just your mom and dad,
205.594	or mom and mommy.
207.421	Can you tell me how you came
207.421	"into the family?"""
211.282	And they explained.
213.602	One said,
215.691	"""My parents did not have good seeds,"
218.865	but there are friendly men out there
218.865	who have spare seeds.
223.386	They bring them to the hospital,
225.16	and they put them in a big jar.
228.249	My mommy went there,
229.51	and she took two from the jar,
232.786	one for me and one for my sister.
235.725	She put the seeds in her belly --
238.161	somehow --
240.236	and her belly grew really big,
242.567	"and there I was."""
245.289	Hmm.
248.123	So only when they started
248.123	mentioning the donor,
252.215	I asked questions about him,
252.215	using their own words.
255.926	I said,
257.349	"""If this would be an apple"
257.349	for the friendly man with the seeds,
261.839	"what would you do with it?"""
264.069	And one boy was thinking out loud,
266.451	holding the apple.
267.843	And he said,
269.89	"""I won't put this one"
269.89	up there with the others.
273.239	He's not part of my family.
276.191	But I will not put him on the ground.
278.409	That's too cold and too hard.
281.024	I think he should be in the trunk,
284.207	because he made my family possible.
287.264	If he would not have done this,
289.242	that would really be sad
289.242	because my family would not be here,
293.224	"and I would not be here."""
297.845	So also, parents
297.845	constructed family tales --
301.397	tales to tell their children.
304.66	One couple explained their insemination
307.811	by taking their children to a farm
311.291	to watch a vet inseminate cows.
315.656	And why not?
317.051	It's their way of explaining;
319.515	their do-it-yourself
319.515	with family narratives.
322.981	DIY.
324.533	And we had another couple
324.533	who made books --
326.925	a book for each child.
328.752	They were really works of art
330.298	containing their thoughts and feelings
330.298	throughout the treatment.
334.192	They even had the hospital
334.192	parking tickets in there.
337.553	So it is DIY:
339.198	finding ways, words and images
341.604	to tell your family story to your child.
345.717	And these stories were highly diverse,
348.94	but they all had one thing in common:
353.913	it was a tale of longing for a child
357.885	and a quest for that child.
360.37	It was about how special
360.37	and how deeply loved their child was.
367.142	And research so far shows
367.142	that these children are doing fine.
371.814	They do not have
371.814	more problems than other kids.
374.854	Yet, these parents also wanted
374.854	to justify their decisions
379.299	through the tales they tell.
381.505	They hoped that their children
381.505	would understand their reasons
384.663	for making the family in this way.
387.865	Underlying was a fear
387.865	that their children might disapprove
391.843	and would reject the non-genetic parent.
394.511	And that fear is understandable,
397.155	because we live in a very heteronormative
400.22	and geneticized society --
402.438	a world that still believes
403.954	that true families consist
403.954	of one mom, one dad
408.13	and their genetically related children.
411.738	Well.
414.165	I want to tell you about a teenage boy.
417.29	He was donor-conceived
417.29	but not part of our study.
420.658	One day, he had an argument
420.658	with his father,
423.3	and he yelled,
425.305	"""You're telling me what to do?"
427.426	"You're not even my father!"""
431.601	That was exactly what
431.601	the parents in our study feared.
435.984	Now, the boy soon felt sorry,
435.984	and they made up.
439.629	But it is the reaction of his father
439.629	that is most interesting.
444.169	He said,
445.772	"""This outburst had nothing to do"
445.772	with the lack of a genetic link.
451.765	It was about puberty --
455.005	being difficult.
456.47	It's what they do at that age.
458.792	"It will pass."""
461.462	What this man shows us
463.342	is that when something goes wrong,
466.564	we should not immediately think
468.189	it is because the family
468.189	is a little different.
471.33	These things happen in all families.
475.936	And every now and then,
477.818	all parents may wonder:
480.412	Am I a good enough parent?
483.164	These parents, too.
485.099	They, above all, wanted to do
485.099	what's best for their child.
489.748	But they also sometimes wondered:
492.034	Am I a real parent?
494.288	And their uncertainties were present
494.288	long before they even were parents.
498.281	At the start of treatment,
499.737	when they first saw the counselor,
502.146	they paid close attention
502.146	to the counselor,
504.865	because they wanted to do it right.
507.853	Even 10 years later,
510.053	they still remember
510.053	the advice they were given.
516.981	So when they thought about the counselor
520.854	and the advice they were given,
522.677	we discussed that.
523.864	And we saw one lesbian couple who said,
528.627	"""When our son asks us,"
530.255	'Do I have a dad?'
533.482	we will say 'No, you do not have a dad.'
536.839	But we will say nothing more,
536.839	not unless he asks,
540.287	because he might not be ready for that.
542.339	"The counselor said so."""
545.35	Well.
547.091	I don't know; that's quite different
549.017	from how we respond
549.017	to children's questions.
552.473	"Like, ""Milk -- is that made in a factory?"""
555.783	"We will say, ""No, it comes from cows,"""
558.969	and we will talk about the farmer,
560.749	and the way the milk ends up in the shop.
563.806	We will not say,
566.102	"""No, milk is not made in a factory."""
572.042	So something strange happened here,
574.496	and of course these children noticed that.
577.571	One boy said,
579.445	"""I asked my parents loads of questions,"
581.861	but they acted really weird.
584.788	So, you know, I have a friend at school,
584.788	and she's made in the same way.
589.241	When I have a question,
589.241	"I just go and ask her."""
593.76	Clever guy.
595.63	Problem solved.
597.765	But his parents did not notice,
600.875	and it certainly was not
600.875	what they had in mind,
603.481	nor what the counselor had in mind
605.439	when they were saying how important
605.439	it is to be an open-communication family.
612.462	And that's the strange thing about advice.
614.74	When we offer people pills,
614.74	we gather evidence first.
618.536	We do tests,
619.816	we do follow-up studies.
621.141	We want to know, and rightly so,
621.141	what this pill is doing
625.092	and how it affects people's lives.
628.035	And advice?
630.748	It is not enough for advice,
632.618	or for professionals to give advice
632.618	that is theoretically sound,
637.465	or well-meant.
639.447	It should be advice
639.447	that there is evidence for --
642.852	evidence that it actually
642.852	improves patients' lives.
648.174	So the philosopher in me
648.174	would now like to offer you a paradox:
654.308	I advise you to stop following advice.
659.897	But, yes.
662.221	(Applause)
666.591	I will not end here with what went wrong;
669.178	I would not be doing justice
669.178	to the warmth we found in those families.
674.931	Remember the books
674.931	and the trip to the farmer?
677.585	When parents do things that work for them,
681.572	they do brilliant things.
684.391	What I want you to remember
684.391	as members of families,
688.058	in no matter what form or shape,
690.93	is that what families need
690.93	are warm relationships.
697.409	And we do not need to be
697.409	professionals to create those.
701.644	Most of us do just fine,
704.986	although it may be hard work,
707.038	and from time to time,
707.038	we can do with some advice.
711.209	In that case,
712.504	bear in mind three things.
715.76	Work with advice
715.76	that works for your family.
720.008	Remember -- you're the expert,
720.008	because you live your family life.
726.681	And finally,
728.478	believe in your abilities
728.478	and your creativity,
733.027	because you can do it yourself.
737.259	Thank you.
738.437	(Applause)
