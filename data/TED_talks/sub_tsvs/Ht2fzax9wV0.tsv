12.336	Motor racing is a funny old business.
14.593	We make a new car every year,
16.91	and then we spend the rest of the season
19.098	trying to understand
19.098	what it is we've built
21.874	to make it better, to make it faster.
25.095	And then the next year, we start again.
28.37	Now, the car you see in front
28.37	of you is quite complicated.
32.608	The chassis is made
32.608	up of about 11,000 components,
36.227	the engine another 6,000,
38.695	the electronics
38.695	about eight and a half thousand.
41.788	So there's about 25,000 things
41.788	there that can go wrong.
46.189	So motor racing is very much
46.189	about attention to detail.
51.015	The other thing about Formula
51.015	1 in particular
54.278	is we're always changing the car.
56.402	We're always trying to make it faster.
58.682	So every two weeks, we will be making
61.666	about 5,000 new components
61.666	to fit to the car.
65.866	Five to 10 percent of the race car
68.044	will be different
68.044	every two weeks of the year.
71.796	So how do we do that?
74.105	Well, we start our life
74.105	with the racing car.
77.849	We have a lot of sensors
77.849	on the car to measure things.
81.84	On the race car in front of you here
83.722	there are about 120 sensors
83.722	when it goes into a race.
86.881	It's measuring all sorts
86.881	of things around the car.
90.533	That data is logged. We're logging about
	within the data systems,
96.289	about 13,000 health parameters and events
99.954	to say when things are not
99.954	working the way they should do,
104.519	and we're sending that data
104.519	back to the garage
107.344	using telemetry at a rate
107.344	of two to four megabits per second.
112.323	So during a two-hour race,
112.323	each car will be sending
117.725	That's twice as many numbers
117.725	as words that each of us
120.868	speaks in a lifetime.
122.499	It's a huge amount of data.
125.117	But it's not enough just
125.117	to have data and measure it.
127.762	You need to be able to do
127.762	something with it.
129.92	So we've spent a lot of time and effort
132.314	in turning the data into stories
134.183	to be able to tell,
134.183	what's the state of the engine,
137.288	how are the tires degrading,
139.56	what's the situation
139.56	with fuel consumption?
143.308	So all of this is taking data
146.096	and turning it into knowledge
146.096	that we can act upon.
149.898	Okay, so let's have a look
149.898	at a little bit of data.
152.536	Let's pick a bit of data from
154.566	another three-month-old patient.
157.645	This is a child, and what you're
157.645	seeing here is real data,
161.816	and on the far right-hand side,
163.793	where everything starts getting
163.793	a little bit catastrophic,
166.579	that is the patient going
166.579	into cardiac arrest.
169.964	It was deemed to be
169.964	an unpredictable event.
173.196	This was a heart attack
173.196	that no one could see coming.
176.985	But when we look at the information there,
179.535	we can see that things
179.535	are starting to become
181.884	a little fuzzy about five minutes
181.884	or so before the cardiac arrest.
185.913	We can see small changes
187.95	in things like the heart rate moving.
190.333	These were all undetected
190.333	by normal thresholds
192.819	which would be applied to data.
195.227	So the question is, why
195.227	couldn't we see it?
198.37	Was this a predictable event?
200.951	Can we look more
200.951	at the patterns in the data
203.961	to be able to do things better?
207.341	So this is a child,
209.991	about the same age
209.991	as the racing car on stage,
213.223	three months old.
214.853	It's a patient with a heart problem.
217.458	Now, when you look at some of the data
217.458	on the screen above,
220.926	things like heart rate, pulse,
220.926	oxygen, respiration rates,
225.828	they're all unusual for a normal child,
228.904	but they're quite normal
228.904	for the child there,
231.546	and so one of the challenges
231.546	you have in health care is,
235.684	how can I look at the patient
235.684	in front of me,
238.535	have something which is specific for her,
241.582	and be able to detect when
241.582	things start to change,
244.37	when things start to deteriorate?
246.469	Because like a racing car, any patient,
249.519	when things start to go
249.519	bad, you have a short time
252.495	to make a difference.
254.326	So what we did is we took a data system
257.08	which we run every two weeks
257.08	of the year in Formula 1
260.211	and we installed it
260.211	on the hospital computers
263.213	at Birmingham Children's Hospital.
265.503	We streamed data
265.503	from the bedside instruments
267.942	in their pediatric intensive care
270.499	so that we could both look
270.499	at the data in real time
273.954	and, more importantly, to store the data
276.826	so that we could start to learn from it.
279.883	And then, we applied an application on top
284.267	which would allow us to tease
284.267	out the patterns in the data
287.537	in real time so we could
287.537	see what was happening,
290.493	so we could determine when
290.493	things started to change.
294.206	Now, in motor racing, we're
294.206	all a little bit ambitious,
298.069	audacious, a little bit
298.069	arrogant sometimes,
300.618	so we decided we would also
300.618	look at the children
304.016	as they were being transported
304.016	to intensive care.
306.973	Why should we wait
306.973	until they arrived in the hospital
309.521	before we started to look?
311.121	And so we installed a real-time link
314.118	between the ambulance and the hospital,
316.954	just using normal 3G
316.954	telephony to send that data
320.73	so that the ambulance became an extra bed
323.217	in intensive care.
326.353	And then we started looking at the data.
330.055	So the wiggly lines
330.055	at the top, all the colors,
332.976	this is the normal sort of data
332.976	you would see on a monitor --
336.17	heart rate, pulse,
336.17	oxygen within the blood,
339.942	and respiration.
342.577	The lines on the bottom,
342.577	the blue and the red,
345.33	these are the interesting ones.
346.831	The red line is showing
346.831	an automated version
349.899	of the early warning score
351.496	that Birmingham Children's Hospital
351.496	were already running.
354.235	They'd been running that since 2008,
356.321	and already have stopped cardiac arrests
358.577	and distress within the hospital.
361.334	The blue line is an indication
363.766	of when patterns start to change,
366.266	and immediately, before we even started
368.575	putting in clinical interpretation,
370.283	we can see that the data
370.283	is speaking to us.
373.153	It's telling us that something
373.153	is going wrong.
376.689	The plot with the red and the green blobs,
380.505	this is plotting different components
383.31	of the data against each other.
385.857	The green is us learning
385.857	what is normal for that child.
389.697	We call it the cloud of normality.
392.307	And when things start to change,
394.548	when conditions start to deteriorate,
397.112	we move into the red line.
399.35	There's no rocket science here.
401.007	It is displaying data that exists
401.007	already in a different way,
405.12	to amplify it, to provide
405.12	cues to the doctors,
408.511	to the nurses, so they can
408.511	see what's happening.
411.249	In the same way that a good racing driver
414.379	relies on cues to decide
414.379	when to apply the brakes,
418.423	when to turn into a corner,
419.899	we need to help
419.899	our physicians and our nurses
422.817	to see when things
422.817	are starting to go wrong.
426.437	So we have a very ambitious program.
429.383	We think that the race is on to do
429.383	something differently.
434.119	We are thinking big.
434.119	It's the right thing to do.
437.023	We have an approach which,
437.023	if it's successful,
440.435	there's no reason why it
440.435	should stay within a hospital.
443.079	It can go beyond the walls.
444.807	With wireless connectivity these days,
446.878	there is no reason why
446.878	patients, doctors and nurses
450.322	always have to be in the same place
452.493	at the same time.
454.486	And meanwhile, we'll take
454.486	our little three-month-old baby,
458.481	keep taking it to the track,
458.481	keeping it safe,
462.238	and making it faster and better.
464.571	Thank you very much.
465.976	(Applause)
