12.774	I'm turning 44 next month,
15.19	and I have the sense that 44
15.19	is going to be a very good year,
19.694	a year of fulfillment, realization.
23.532	I have that sense,
24.919	not because of anything
24.919	particular in store for me,
27.99	but because I read it would be a good year
30.774	in a 1968 book by Norman Mailer.
34.497	"""He felt his own age, forty-four ..."""
37.473	"wrote Mailer in ""The Armies of the Night,"""
40.415	"""... felt as if he were a solid embodiment"
42.901	of bone, muscle, heart, mind,
42.901	and sentiment to be a man,
46.695	"as if he had arrived."""
49.207	Yes, I know Mailer
49.207	wasn't writing about me.
52.295	But I also know that he was;
54.617	for all of us -- you, me,
54.617	the subject of his book,
58.615	age more or less in step,
60.849	proceed from birth
60.849	along the same great sequence:
65.224	through the wonders
65.224	and confinements of childhood;
68.425	the emancipations
68.425	and frustrations of adolescence;
72.38	the empowerments
72.38	and millstones of adulthood;
76.188	the recognitions
76.188	and resignations of old age.
80.391	There are patterns to life,
82.317	and they are shared.
84.23	As Thomas Mann wrote:
84.23	"""It will happen to me as to them."""
89.772	We don't simply live these patterns.
92.013	We record them, too.
93.766	We write them down in books,
93.766	where they become narratives
96.997	that we can then read and recognize.
99.669	Books tell us who we've been,
101.984	who we are, who we will be, too.
105.492	So they have for millennia.
108.162	As James Salter wrote,
109.829	"""Life passes into pages"
109.829	"if it passes into anything."""
114.979	And so six years ago,
114.979	a thought leapt to mind:
118.372	if life passed into pages,
118.372	there were, somewhere,
122.327	passages written about every age.
124.711	If I could find them, I could
124.711	assemble them into a narrative.
128.315	I could assemble them into a life,
130.377	a long life, a hundred-year life,
133.147	the entirety of that same great sequence
135.464	through which the luckiest among us pass.
139.321	I was then 37 years old,
142.613	"""an age of discretion,"""
142.613	wrote William Trevor.
147.074	I was prone to meditating on time and age.
150.322	An illness in the family
150.322	and later an injury to me
153.189	had long made clear that growing old
153.189	could not be assumed.
157.056	And besides, growing old
157.056	only postponed the inevitable,
160.715	time seeing through
160.715	what circumstance did not.
163.947	It was all a bit disheartening.
166.413	A list, though, would last.
169.334	To chronicle a life
169.334	year by vulnerable year
172.503	would be to clasp and to ground
172.503	what was fleeting,
175.764	would be to provide myself and others
175.764	a glimpse into the future,
179.131	whether we made it there or not.
181.574	And when I then began to compile my list,
181.574	I was quickly obsessed,
185.685	searching pages and pages
185.685	for ages and ages.
189.702	Here we were at every annual step
189.702	through our first hundred years.
194.624	"""Twenty-seven ... a time"
194.624	"of sudden revelations,"""
199.048	"""sixty-two, ... of subtle diminishments."""
203.989	I was mindful, of course,
203.989	that such insights were relative.
208.405	For starters, we now live longer,
208.405	and so age more slowly.
213.151	Christopher Isherwood used
213.151	"the phrase ""the yellow leaf"""
216.335	to describe a man at 53,
218.51	only one century after Lord Byron
218.51	used it to describe himself at 36.
222.853	(Laughter)
225.154	I was mindful, too, that life
225.154	can swing wildly and unpredictably
228.797	from one year to the next,
230.609	and that people may experience
230.609	the same age differently.
234.045	But even so, as the list coalesced,
237.643	so, too, on the page, clear
237.643	as the reflection in the mirror,
241.056	did the life that I had been living:
243.71	"finding at 20 that ""... one is less"
243.71	"and less sure of who one is;"""
248.002	"emerging at 30 from the ""... wasteland"
248.002	"of preparation into active life;"""
253.057	"learning at 40 ""... to close softly"
253.057	the doors to rooms
257.197	"[I would] not be coming back to."""
260.72	There I was.
263.885	Of course, there we all are.
266.762	Milton Glaser, the great graphic designer
269.224	whose beautiful
269.224	visualizations you see here,
272.519	and who today is 85 --
274.403	"all those years ""... a ripening"
274.403	"and an apotheosis,"" wrote Nabokov --"
279.211	noted to me that, like art and like color,
283.455	literature helps us to remember
283.455	what we've experienced.
287.095	And indeed, when I shared
287.095	the list with my grandfather,
290.857	he nodded in recognition.
293.339	He was then 95 and soon to die,
297.234	which, wrote Roberto Bola√±o,
299.379	"""... is the same as never dying."""
303.556	And looking back, he said to me that, yes,
307.357	Proust was right that at 22,
307.357	we are sure we will not die,
313.873	just as a thanatologist
313.873	named Edwin Shneidman was right
316.678	that at 90, we are sure we will.
321.229	It had happened to him,
323.234	as to them.
327.479	Now the list is done:
330.169	a hundred years.
333.443	And looking back over it,
336.298	I know that I am not done.
338.8	I still have my life to live,
340.919	still have many more pages to pass into.
344.546	And mindful of Mailer,
346.422	I await 44.
348.746	Thank you.
349.948	(Applause)
