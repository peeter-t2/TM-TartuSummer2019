25.603	On September 10, the morning
25.603	of my seventh birthday,
28.928	I came downstairs to the kitchen,
28.928	where my mother was washing the dishes
32.343	and my father was reading
32.343	the paper or something,
35	and I sort of presented myself to them
35	in the doorway, and they said,
38.31	"""Hey, happy birthday!"""
38.31	"And I said, ""I'm seven."""
43	And my father smiled and said,
45	"""Well, you know"
45	"what that means, don't you?"""
47.41	"And I said, ""Yeah,"
47.41	that I'm going to have a party
50.26	"and a cake and get a lot of presents?"""
52.507	"And my dad said, ""Well, yes."
54.742	But more importantly,
55.926	being seven means that
55.926	you've reached the age of reason,
58.895	and you're now capable of committing
58.895	"any and all sins against God and man."""
63.446	(Laughter)
66.322	Now, I had heard this phrase,
66.322	"""age of reason,"" before."
69.572	Sister Mary Kevin
69.572	had been bandying it about
71.847	my second-grade class at school.
73.568	But when she said it,
74.744	the phrase seemed all caught up
74.744	in the excitement of preparations
77.829	for our first communion
77.829	and our first confession,
80.16	and everybody knew that was really
80.16	all about the white dress
83.01	and the white veil.
84.185	And anyway, I hadn't really paid
84.185	all that much attention
86.849	"to that phrase, ""age of reason."""
88.712	"So, I said, ""Yeah, yeah, age of reason."
88.712	"What does that mean again?"""
92.924	"And my dad said, ""Well, we believe,"
92.924	in the Catholic Church,
96.578	that God knows that little kids don't know
96.578	the difference between right and wrong,
100.479	but when you're seven,
100.479	you're old enough to know better.
103.141	So, you've grown up
103.141	and reached the age of reason,
105.78	and now God will start
105.78	keeping notes on you,
108.421	"and begin your permanent record."""
110.401	(Laughter)
111.435	"And I said, ""Oh ..."
115.767	Wait a minute.
117.006	You mean all that time, up till today,
120.204	all that time I was so good,
120.204	"God didn't notice it?"""
124.376	"And my mom said, ""Well, I noticed it."""
127	(Laughter)
129	"And I thought, ""How could"
129	I not have known this before?
131.609	How could it not have sunk in
131.609	when they'd been telling me?
134.363	All that being good
134.363	and no real credit for it.
136.555	And worst of all,
136.555	how could I not have realized
138.788	this very important information
140.296	until the very day
140.296	"that it was basically useless to me?"""
143.242	"So I said, ""Well, Mom and Dad,"
143.242	what about Santa Claus?
146.632	I mean, Santa Claus knows
146.632	"if you're naughty or nice, right?"""
150	"And my dad said, ""Yeah, but, honey,"
152	I think that's technically just
152	"between Thanksgiving and Christmas."""
155.289	"And my mother said, ""Oh, Bob, stop it."
155.289	Let's just tell her. I mean, she's seven.
159.725	"Julie, there is no Santa Claus."""
162.085	(Laughter)
165.18	Now, this was actually
165.18	not that upsetting to me.
168.919	My parents had this whole
168.919	elaborate story about Santa Claus:
171.889	how they had talked to Santa Claus
171.889	himself and agreed
174.419	that instead of Santa
174.419	delivering our presents
176.544	over the night of Christmas Eve,
178.107	like he did for every other family
178.107	who got to open their surprises
181.246	first thing Christmas morning,
182.716	our family would give Santa more time.
184.707	Santa would come to our house
184.707	while we were at nine o'clock high mass
188.31	on Christmas morning, but only
188.31	if all of us kids did not make a fuss.
192.302	Which made me very suspicious.
195	It was pretty obvious that it was really
195	our parents giving us the presents.
199.095	I mean, my dad had a very
199.095	distinctive wrapping style,
202	and my mother's handwriting
202	was so close to Santa's.
204.673	(Laughter)
205.855	Plus, why would Santa save time
205.855	by having to loop back
208.612	to our house after he'd gone
208.612	to everybody else's?
211.74	There was only one obvious conclusion
211.74	to reach from this mountain of evidence:
215.534	our family was too strange and weird
215.534	for even Santa Claus to come visit,
220.071	and my poor parents were trying
220.071	to protect us from the embarrassment,
223.35	this humiliation of rejection
223.35	by Santa, who was jolly --
227.135	but let's face it,
227.135	he was also very judgmental.
230.214	So to find out that there was
230.214	no Santa Claus at all
232.801	was actually sort of a relief.
235	I left the kitchen not really
235	in shock about Santa,
237.959	but rather, I was just dumbfounded
239.684	about how I could have missed
239.684	this whole age of reason thing.
242.752	It was too late for me,
242.752	but maybe I could help someone else,
246	someone who could use the information.
248.52	They had to fit two criteria:
250.197	they had to be old enough
250.197	to be able to understand
252.562	the whole concept of the age
252.562	of reason, and not yet seven.
256.125	The answer was clear:
256.125	my brother Bill. He was six.
259.277	Well, I finally found Bill
260.563	about a block away from our house
260.563	at this public school playground.
263.796	It was a Saturday,
263.796	and he was all by himself,
265.936	just kicking a ball
265.936	against the side of a wall.
268.166	"I ran up to him and said, ""Bill!"
270	I just realized that the age of reason
270	starts when you turn seven,
273.167	and then you're capable
273.167	of committing any and all sins
275.737	"against God and man."""
276.912	"And Bill said, ""So?"""
278.924	"And I said, ""So, you're six."
280.934	You have a whole year to do anything
280.934	"you want to and God won't notice it."""
284.996	"And he said, ""So?"""
286.762	"And I said, ""So? So everything!"""
290.357	And I turned to run.
290.357	I was so angry with him.
293.206	But when I got to the top of the steps,
295.104	I turned around dramatically and said,
296.945	"""Oh, by the way, Bill --"
296.945	"there is no Santa Claus."""
300.4	(Laughter)
302.352	Now, I didn't know it at the time,
304.115	but I really wasn't turning seven
304.115	on September 10th.
307.285	For my 13th birthday,
308.634	I planned a slumber party
308.634	with all of my girlfriends,
311.229	but a couple of weeks beforehand
311.229	my mother took me aside and said,
314.855	"""I need to speak to you privately."
318.101	September 10th is not your birthday.
318.101	"It's October 10th."""
322.106	"And I said, ""What?"""
323.679	(Laughter)
324.718	And she said ...
326.003	(Laughter)
327.581	"""Listen. The cut-off date to start"
327.581	"kindergarten was September 15th."""
333	(Laughter)
334.227	"""So I told them that your birthday"
334.227	was September 10th,
337.068	and then I wasn't sure
338.243	that you weren't just going to go
338.243	blab it all over the place,
341.135	so I started to tell you
341.135	your birthday was September 10th.
344.841	But, Julie, you were so ready to start
344.841	"school, honey. You were so ready."""
349.07	I thought about it, and when I was four,
351	I was already the oldest of four children,
353.024	and my mother even had
353.024	another child to come,
355.167	so what I think she --
355.167	understandably -- really meant
357.696	was that she was so ready,
357.696	she was so ready.
360.095	"Then she said, ""Don't worry, Julie."
361.793	Every year on October 10th,
363.286	when it was your birthday
363.286	but you didn't realize it,
366.16	I made sure that you ate
366.16	"a piece of cake that day."""
369.401	(Laughter)
372.252	Which was comforting, but troubling.
374.57	My mother had been celebrating
374.57	my birthday with me, without me.
378.133	(Laughter)
379.165	What was so upsetting
379.165	about this new piece of information
382.178	was not that I had to change
382.178	the date of my slumber party
384.877	with all of my girlfriends.
386.203	What was most upsetting
386.203	was that this meant I was not a Virgo.
390.087	I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom.
393.186	And I read my horoscope every single day,
395.783	and it was so totally me.
398	(Laughter)
400	And this meant that I was a Libra?
402.753	So, I took the bus downtown
402.753	to get the new Libra poster.
406.091	The Virgo poster is a picture
406.091	of a beautiful woman with long hair,
409.512	sort of lounging by some water,
411.068	but the Libra poster is just a huge scale.
413.926	This was around the time
413.926	that I started filling out physically,
416.917	and I was filling out a lot more
416.917	than a lot of the other girls,
419.924	and frankly, the whole idea
419.924	that my astrological sign was a scale
423.652	just seemed ominous and depressing.
426	(Laughter)
429.169	But I got the new Libra poster,
431	and I started to read
431	my new Libra horoscope,
434.301	and I was astonished to find
434.301	that it was also totally me.
438.751	(Laughter)
440.311	It wasn't until years later, looking back
442.316	on this whole age-of-reason,
442.316	change-of-birthday thing,
444.999	that it dawned on me:
446.31	I wasn't turning seven
446.31	when I thought I turned seven.
448.857	I had a whole other month
450.127	to do anything I wanted to
450.127	before God started keeping tabs on me.
454.238	Oh, life can be so cruel.
458.317	One day, two Mormon
458.317	missionaries came to my door.
462.192	Now, I just live off a main
462.192	thoroughfare in Los Angeles,
464.852	and my block is -- well,
464.852	it's a natural beginning
467.175	for people who are peddling
467.175	things door to door.
469.588	Sometimes I get little old ladies
469.588	from the Seventh Day Adventist Church
473	showing me these cartoon
473	pictures of heaven.
475.186	And sometimes I get
475.186	teenagers who promise me
477.45	that they won't join a gang
477.45	and just start robbing people,
480.329	if I only buy some
480.329	magazine subscriptions from them.
483.556	So normally, I just ignore the doorbell,
483.556	but on this day, I answered.
488	And there stood two boys, each about 19,
488	in white, starched short-sleeved shirts,
493.309	and they had little name tags
494.793	that identified them
494.793	as official representatives
497.11	of the Church of Jesus Christ
497.11	of Latter-day Saints,
499.935	and they said they had
499.935	a message for me, from God.
503.629	"I said, ""A message for me? From God?"""
503.629	"And they said, ""Yes."""
508.848	Now, I was raised
508.848	in the Pacific Northwest,
511	around a lot of Church of Latter-day
511	Saints people and, you know,
514.111	I've worked with them and even dated them,
516.144	but I never really knew the doctrine,
517.946	or what they said to people
517.946	when they were out on a mission,
520.782	and I guess I was sort of curious,
520.782	"so I said, ""Well, please, come in."""
524.111	And they looked really happy,
525.532	because I don't think this happens
525.532	to them all that often.
528.286	(Laughter)
529.317	And I sat them down,
529.317	and I got them glasses of water --
543.085	Ok, I got it, I got it.
544.664	I got them glasses of water.
546.093	Don't touch my hair, that's the thing.
547.943	(Laughter)
550.952	You can't put a video
550.952	of myself in front of me
554	and expect me not to fix my hair.
555.938	Ok.
557.29	(Laughter)
561.401	So I sat them down
561.401	and I got them glasses of water,
563.816	and after niceties, they said,
565.797	"""Do you believe that God loves you"
565.797	"with all his heart?"""
568.433	"And I thought, ""Well,"
568.433	of course I believe in God,
572	but you know, I don't like
572	that word 'heart,'
574.535	because it anthropomorphizes God,
577	and I don't like the word, 'his,'
577	"either, because that sexualizes God."""
581.677	But I didn't want to argue
581.677	semantics with these boys,
584.198	so after a very long,
584.198	uncomfortable pause, I said,
587.903	"""Yes, yes, I do. I feel very loved."""
591.862	And they looked at each other and smiled,
593.862	like that was the right answer.
595.957	"And then they said, ""Do you believe"
597.664	that we're all brothers
597.664	"and sisters on this planet?"""
600.135	"And I said, ""Yes, I do."""
601.31	And I was so relieved that it was
601.31	a question I could answer so quickly.
604.686	"And they said, ""Well, then"
604.686	"we have a story to tell you."""
607.801	And they told me this story
607.801	all about this guy named Lehi,
611	who lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC.
613.907	Now, apparently in Jerusalem in 600 BC,
613.907	everyone was completely bad and evil.
618.48	Every single one of them:
618.48	man, woman, child, infant, fetus.
622	And God came to Lehi and said to him,
624.66	"""Put your family on a boat"
624.66	"and I will lead you out of here."""
627.569	And God did lead them.
629	He led them to America.
632.172	"I said, ""America?"
633.667	(Laughter)
635.756	From Jerusalem to America
635.756	"by boat in 600 BC?"""
640.443	"And they said, ""Yes."""
642	(Laughter)
643.879	Then they told me
643.879	how Lehi and his descendants
646.167	reproduced and reproduced,
646.167	and over the course of 600 years,
649.066	there were two great races of them,
649.066	the Nephites and the Lamanites,
652.344	and the Nephites were totally good --
652.344	each and every one of them --
655.818	and the Lamanites
655.818	were totally bad and evil --
658.009	every single one of them
658.009	just bad to the bone.
660.184	Then, after Jesus died
660.184	on the cross for our sins,
663.716	on his way up to heaven,
664.907	he stopped by America
664.907	and visited the Nephites.
667.504	(Laughter)
668.554	And he told them that if they all remained
668.554	totally, totally good --
672.066	each and every one of them --
673.472	they would win the war
673.472	against the evil Lamanites.
676.197	But apparently somebody blew it,
678.722	because the Lamanites
678.722	were able to kill all the Nephites.
681.483	All but one guy, this guy named Mormon,
683.773	who managed to survive
683.773	by hiding in the woods.
686.543	And he made sure
686.543	this whole story was written down
689.277	in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics
689.277	chiseled onto gold plates,
693.669	which he then buried
693.669	near Palmyra, New York.
696.76	(Laughter)
702.259	Well, I was just on the edge of my seat.
705	(Laughter)
708.366	"I said, ""What happened to the Lamanites?"""
711.242	"And they said, ""Well, they became"
711.242	"our Native Americans, here in the U.S."""
715.108	"And I said, ""So, you believe"
715.108	the Native Americans are descended
718.318	"from a people who were totally evil?"""
720.383	"And they said, ""Yes."""
722.627	Then they told me
722.627	how this guy named Joseph Smith
725.707	found those buried gold plates
725.707	right in his backyard,
729.366	and he also found this magic stone
729.366	back there that he put into his hat
733.112	and then buried his face into,
734.634	and this allowed him
734.634	to translate the gold plates
737.018	from the reformed Egyptian into English.
739.89	Well, at this point I just wanted to give
739.89	these two boys some advice
743.289	about their pitch.
744.742	(Laughter)
747.607	I wanted to say --
748.791	(Applause)
750.481	"""Ok, don't start with this story."""
752.771	(Laughter)
754	I mean, even the Scientologists
756.067	know to start with a personality test
756.067	before they start --
759.376	(Applause)
761	telling people all about Xenu,
761	the evil intergalactic overlord.
766.138	"Then, they said, ""Do you believe"
766.138	that God speaks to us
768.749	"through his righteous prophets?"""
770.313	"And I said, ""No, I don't,"""
771.59	because I was sort of upset
771.59	about this Lamanite story
774.099	and this crazy gold plate story,
775.675	but the truth was,
775.675	I hadn't really thought this through,
778.533	so I backpedaled a little and I said,
780.755	"""Well, what exactly"
780.755	do you mean by 'righteous'?
783.666	And what do you mean by prophets?
783.666	"Like, could the prophets be women?"""
787.15	"And they said, ""No."" And I said, ""Why?"""
790.72	"And they said, ""Well, it's because"
790.72	God gave women a gift
794.463	that is so spectacular,
796.458	it is so wonderful, that the only gift
796.458	he had left over to give men
801.259	"was the gift of prophecy."""
803.656	What is this wonderful gift
803.656	God gave women, I wondered?
807.003	Maybe their greater ability
807.003	to cooperate and adapt?
810.366	(Laughter)
811.402	Women's longer lifespan?
812.803	The fact that women tend to be
812.803	much less violent than men?
816.031	But no -- it wasn't any of these gifts.
818.313	"They said, ""Well, it's her ability"
818.313	"to bear children."""
821.401	"I said, ""Oh, come on."
822.853	I mean, even if women
822.853	tried to have a baby every single year
825.696	from the time they were 15
825.696	to the time they were 45,
828.657	assuming they didn't die from exhaustion,
830.677	it still seems like some women
830.677	would have some time left over
833.589	"to hear the word of God."""
835.059	"And they said, ""No."""
837	(Laughter)
840	Well, then they didn't look so
840	fresh-faced and cute to me any more,
843.188	but they had more to say.
844.417	"They said, ""Well, we also believe"
844.417	that if you're a Mormon,
847.175	and if you're in good standing
847.175	with the church,
849.413	when you die, you get to go to heaven
851.573	"and be with your family for all eternity."""
854.378	"And I said, ""Oh, dear."
856.46	(Laughter)
863.388	That wouldn't be
863.388	"such a good incentive for me."""
865.611	(Laughter)
866.935	"And they said, ""Oh."
868.444	(Laughter)
869.827	Hey! Well, we also believe
869.827	that when you go to heaven,
872.896	you get your body restored to you
872.896	in its best original state.
875.807	Like, if you'd lost a leg,
875.807	well, you get it back.
878.261	"Or, if you'd gone blind, you could see."""
880.261	"I said, ""Oh. Now, I don't have a uterus,"
883.254	because I had cancer a few years ago.
885.369	So does this mean
885.369	that if I went to heaven,
887.439	"I would get my old uterus back?"""
889.495	"And they said, ""Sure."""
891.575	"And I said, ""I don't want it back."
891.575	"I'm happy without it."" Gosh."
897.364	What if you had a nose job
897.364	and you liked it?
900.355	(Laughter)
902.085	Would God force you
902.085	to get your old nose back?
905.824	Then they gave me this Book of Mormon,
907.769	told me to read
907.769	this chapter and that chapter,
909.946	and said they'd come back
909.946	and check in on me,
912.248	and I think I said something
912.248	"like, ""Please don't hurry,"""
914.937	"or maybe just, ""Please don't,"""
914.937	and they were gone.
917.339	Ok, so I initially felt
917.339	really superior to these boys,
919.951	and smug in my more conventional faith.
923.417	But then the more I thought about it,
923.417	the more I had to be honest with myself.
927.12	If someone came to my door
928.447	and I was hearing Catholic theology
928.447	and dogma for the very first time,
931.816	"and they said, ""We believe that God"
931.816	impregnated a very young girl
935.414	without the use of intercourse,
937	and the fact that she was a virgin
937	"is maniacally important to us."""
940.215	(Laughter)
941.541	"""And she had a baby,"
941.541	"and that's the son of God,"""
944.712	I mean, I would think
944.712	that's equally ridiculous.
947	I'm just so used to that story.
948.886	(Laughter)
950	So, I couldn't let myself feel
950	condescending towards these boys.
953.48	But the question they asked me
953.48	when they first arrived
956.064	really stuck in my head:
957.548	Did I believe that God
957.548	loved me with all his heart?
961	Because I wasn't exactly sure
961	how I felt about that question.
964.542	Now, if they had asked me,
965.841	"""Do you feel that God loves"
965.841	"you with all his heart?"""
969.091	Well, that would have been much different,
969.091	I think I would have instantly answered,
973.121	"""Yes, yes, I feel it all the time."
974.77	I feel God's love
974.77	when I'm hurt and confused,
977.539	and I feel consoled and cared for.
980.191	I take shelter in God's love when
980.191	I don't understand why tragedy hits,
984.283	and I feel God's love when I look
984.283	"with gratitude at all the beauty I see."""
988.548	But since they asked me that question
988.548	"with the word ""believe"" in it,"
991.774	somehow it was all different,
993.256	because I wasn't exactly sure
993.256	if I believed what I so clearly felt.
