18.799	You know, we wake up in the morning,
21.875	you get dressed, put on your shoes,
24.395	you head out into the world.
26.907	You plan on coming back, getting undressed,
31.158	going to bed,
33.383	waking up, doing it again,
35.137	and that anticipation, that rhythm,
38.285	helps give us a structure
40.555	to how we organize ourselves and our lives,
44.143	and gives it a measure of predictability.
47.623	Living in New York City, as I do,
50.011	it's almost as if, with so many people doing so many things
57.25	at the same time in such close quarters,
60.6	it's almost like life is dealing you extra hands
63.839	out of that deck.
65.365	You're never, there's just, juxtapositions are possible
70.033	that just aren't, you don't think they're going to happen.
75.036	And you never think you're going to be the guy
77.379	who's walking down the street
79.009	and, because you choose to go down one side or the other,
82.431	the rest of your life is changed forever.
85.591	And one night, I'm riding the uptown local train.
91.319	I get on. I tend to be a little bit vigilant
94.815	when I get on the subway.
96.932	I'm not one of the people zoning out with headphones
99.978	or a book.
101.361	And I get on the car, and I look, and I
104.167	notice this couple,
106.751	college-aged, student-looking kids,
110.239	a guy and a girl, and they're sitting next to each other,
112.036	and she's got her leg draped over his knee,
114.685	and they're doing -- they have this little contraption,
118.845	and they're tying these knots,
120.603	and they're doing it with one hand,
122.44	they're doing it left-handed and right-handed very quickly,
126.404	and then she'll hand the thing to him and he'll do it.
128.652	I've never seen anything like this.
129.853	It's almost like they're practicing magic tricks.
133.237	And at the next stop, a guy gets on the car,
137.556	and he has this sort of visiting professor look to him.
141.534	He's got the overstuffed leather satchel
143.654	and the rectangular file case and a laptop bag
146.964	and the tweed jacket with the leather patches,
149.476	and — (Laughter) —
151.453	he looks at them, and then
154.276	in a blink of an eye, he kneels down in front of them,
157.292	and he starts to say,
158.957	"""You know, listen, here's how you can do it. Look,"
161.026	"if you do this -- "" and he takes the laces out of their hand,"
163.645	and instantly, he starts tying these knots,
166.956	and even better than they were doing it, remarkably.
171.617	And it turns out they are medical students
174.697	on their way to a lecture about the latest
176.809	suturing techniques, and he's the guy giving the lecture.
180.035	(Laughter)
181.643	So he starts to tell them, and he's like,
184.057	"""No, this is very important here. You know,"
186.565	when you're needing these knots,
188.845	it's going to be, you know, everything's
190.437	going to be happening at the same time, it's going to be --
194.19	you're going to have all this information coming at you,
197.827	there's going to be organs getting in the way,
199.323	it's going to be slippery,
201.358	and
202.668	it's just very important that you be able to do these
205.426	beyond second nature, each hand, left hand, right hand,
208.796	"you have to be able to do them without seeing your fingers."""
211.624	And at that moment, when I heard that,
213.994	I just got catapulted out of the subway car into a night
221.066	when I had been getting a ride in an ambulance
224.2	from the sidewalk where I had been stabbed
228.691	to the trauma room of St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan,
233.01	and what had happened was
234.999	a gang had come in from Brooklyn.
238.208	As part of an initiation for three of their members,
240.831	they had to kill somebody,
242.535	and I happened to be the guy walking down Bleecker Street
245.922	that night,
247.219	and they jumped on me without a word.
251.656	One of the very lucky things,
253.981	when I was at Notre Dame, I was on the boxing team,
256.989	so I put my hands up right away, instinctively.
261.637	The guy on the right had a knife with a 10-inch blade,
265.189	and he went in under my elbow,
268.482	and it went up and cut my inferior vena cava.
272.949	If you know anything about anatomy,
274.669	that's not a good thing to get cut,
276.377	and everything, of course, on the way up,
279.535	and then — I still had my hands up —
281.425	he pulled it out and went for my neck,
283.914	and sunk it in up to the hilt in my neck,
288.119	and I got one straight right punch
290.843	and knocked the middle guy out.
292.614	The other guy was still working on me,
294.827	collapsing my other lung,
296.692	and I managed to, by hitting that guy, to get a minute.
302.672	I ran down the street and collapsed,
304.765	and the ambulance guys intubated me on the sidewalk
307.812	and let the trauma room know
310.285	they had an incoming.
311.903	And one of the
314.902	side effects of having major massive blood loss
318.843	is you get tunnel vision,
320.69	so I remember being on the stretcher
322.503	and having a little nickel-sized cone of vision,
326.508	and I was moving my head around
328.057	and we got to St. Vincent's,
329.413	and we're racing down this hallway,
331.056	and I see the lights going,
333.324	and it's a peculiar effect of memories like that.
340.052	They don't really go to the usual place that memories go.
344.231	They kind of have this vault where they're stored in high-def,
349.435	and George Lucas did all the sound effects. (Laughter)
353.92	So sometimes, remembering them, it's like,
358.416	it's not like any other kind of memories.
362.14	And I get into the trauma room,
364.812	and they're waiting for me, and the lights are there,
367.834	and I'd been able to breathe a little more now,
373.129	because the blood has left, had been filling up my lungs
376.608	and I was having a very hard time breathing,
378.574	but now it's kind of gone into the stretcher.
381.616	"And I said, ""Is there anything I can do to help?"""
384.92	and — (Laughter) —
386.692	the nurse kind of had a hysterical laugh, and
390.006	I'm turning my head trying to see everybody,
392.254	and I had this weird memory of being in college
396.07	and raising,
398.982	raising money for the flood victims of Bangladesh,
403.039	and then I look over and my anesthesiologist
405.496	is clamping the mask on me, and I think,
407.029	"""He looks Bangladeshi,"" — (Laughter) —"
409.09	and I just have those two facts, and I just think,
412.575	"""This could work somehow."" (Laughter)"
416.289	And then I go out, and
418.567	they work on me for the rest of the night,
420.343	and I needed about 40 units of blood to keep me there
425.356	while they did their work,
428.401	and the surgeon took out about a third of my intestines,
432.625	my cecum, organs I didn't know that I had,
436.044	and he later told me one of the last things he did
438.415	while he was in there was to remove my appendix for me,
441.76	which I thought was great, you know,
443.983	just a little tidy thing there at the end. (Laughter)
447.146	And I came to in the morning.
451.464	Out of anesthetic, he had let them know
453.28	that he wanted to be there, and he had given me
456.768	about a two percent chance of living.
459.963	So he was there when I woke up,
461.875	and it was, waking up was like
464.036	breaking through the ice into a frozen lake of pain.
470.253	It was that enveloping,
472.356	and there was only one spot that didn't hurt
476.528	worse than anything I'd ever felt,
478.001	and it was my instep,
479.407	and he was holding the arch of my foot
483.153	and rubbing the instep with his thumb.
487.021	And I looked up, and he's like,
489.957	"""Good to see you,"""
491.078	and I was trying to remember what had happened
495.014	and trying to get my head around everything,
496.732	and the pain was just overwhelming, and he said,
500.789	"""You know, we didn't cut your hair. I thought"
504.165	you might have gotten strength from your hair like Samson,
508.537	"and you're going to need all the strength you can get."""
511.32	And in those days, my hair was down to my waist,
515.029	I drove a motorcycle, I was unmarried,
517.901	I owned a bar, so those were different times. (Laughter)
523.21	But
525.47	I had three days of life support,
528.442	and everybody was expecting,
532.223	due to just the massive amount of what they had had to do
536.716	that I wasn't going to make it,
538.544	so it was three days of
540.589	everybody was either waiting for me to die or poop,
543.416	and — (Laughter) —
545.012	when I finally pooped, then that somehow,
547.971	surgically speaking, that's like you crossed some good line,
551.378	and, um — (Laughter) —
552.418	on that day, the surgeon came in
555.683	and whipped the sheet off of me.
558.875	He had three or four friends with him,
560.536	and he does that, and they all look,
562.938	and there was no infection,
564.819	and they bend over me and they're poking and prodding,
567.689	"and they're like, ""There's no hematomas, blah blah,"
569.786	"look at the color,"" and they're talking amongst themselves"
572.656	and I'm, like, this restored automobile
575.579	"that he's just going, ""Yeah, I did that."" (Laughter)"
578.77	And it was just,
581.794	it was amazing, because these guys are high-fiving him
584.93	over how good I turned out, you know? (Laughter)
586.99	And it's my zipper, and I've still got the staples in
590.511	and everything.
591.747	And
593.962	later on, when I got out
596.573	and the flashbacks and the
602.185	nightmares were giving me a hard time,
606.69	I went back to him
608.372	and I was sort of asking him,
612.265	you know, what am I gonna do?
614.446	And I think, kind of, as a surgeon, he basically said,
619.054	"""Kid, I saved your life."
620.78	Like, now you can do whatever you want, like,
623.43	you gotta get on with that.
625.096	It's like I gave you a new car
626.928	and you're complaining about not finding parking.
629.22	Like, just, go out, and, you know, do your best.
632.821	"But you're alive. That's what it's about."""
637.627	"And then I hear, ""Bing-bong,"" and the subway doors"
643.408	are closing, and my stop is next, and I look at these kids,
649.647	and I go, I think to myself,
651.516	"""I'm going to lift my shirt up"
653.078	"and show them,"" — (Laughter) —"
654.695	"and then I think, ""No, this is the New York City subway,"
656.924	"that's going to lead to other things."" (Laughter)"
660.555	And so I just think, they got their lecture to go to.
664.597	I step off, I'm standing on the platform,
668.558	and I feel my index finger
671.422	in
673.601	the first scar that I ever got,
677.304	from my umbilical cord,
680.418	and then around that, is traced
683.656	the last scar that I got
686.152	from my surgeon,
688.529	and I think that, that chance encounter
693.843	with those kids on the street with their knives
697.732	led me
700.165	to my surgical team,
703.29	and their training
707.365	and their skill
709.481	and, always, a little bit of luck
712.901	pushed back against chaos.
715.872	Thank you. (Applause)
719.926	(Applause)
728.87	Thank you. Very lucky to be here. Thank you. (Applause)
