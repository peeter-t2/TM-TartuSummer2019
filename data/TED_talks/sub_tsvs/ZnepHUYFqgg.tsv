31	Well, first of all, let me thank Emeka -- as a matter of fact,
36	TED Global -- for putting this conference together.
41	This conference is going to rank as the most important
47	in the beginning of the 21st century.
50	Think African governments will put together a conference like this?
53	You think the A.U. will put together a conference like this?
57	Even before they do that they will ask for foreign aid.
61	I would also like to pay homage and honor to the TED Fellows
70	June Arunga, James Shikwati, Andrew, and the other TED Fellows.
78	I call them the Cheetah Generation.
82	The Cheetah Generation is a new breed of Africans
85	who brook no nonsense about corruption.
88	They understand what accountability and democracy is.
93	They're not going to wait for government to do things for them.
97	That's the Cheetah Generation,
99	and Africa's salvation rests on the backs of these Cheetahs.
104	In contrast, of course, we have the Hippo Generation.
107	(Laughter)
110	The Hippo Generation are the ruling elites.
113	They are stuck in their intellectual patch.
117	Complaining about colonialism and imperialism,
121	they wouldn't move one foot.
123	If you ask them to reform the economies,
126	they're not going to reform it
128	because they benefit from the rotten status quo.
131	Now, there are a lot of Africans who are very angry,
133	angry at the condition of Africa.
138	Now, we're talking about a continent that is not poor.
142	It is rich in mineral resources, natural mineral resources.
147	But the mineral wealth of Africa is not being utilized
151	to lift its people out of poverty.
154	That's what makes a lot of Africans very angry.
158	And in a way, Africa is more than a tragedy, in more ways than one.
164	There's another enduring tragedy, and that tragedy is that
168	there are so many people, so many governments,
171	so many organizations who want to help the people in Africa.
175	They don't understand.
179	Now, we're not saying don't help Africa.
181	Helping Africa is noble.
184	But helping Africa has been turned into a theater of the absurd.
190	It's like the blind leading the clueless.
194	(Laughter)
197	There are certain things that we need to recognize.
201	Africa's begging-bowl leaks.
205	Did you know that 40 percent of the wealth created in Africa
208	is not invested here in Africa?
210	It's taken out of Africa.
212	That's what the World Bank says.
216	Look at Africa's begging-bowl.
219	It leaks horribly.
222	There are people who think that we should pour more money,
225	more aid into this bowl which leaks.
230	What are the leakages?
233	Corruption alone costs Africa 148 billion dollars a year.
240	Yes, put that aside.
243	Capital flight out of Africa, 80 billion a year.
248	Put that aside.
251	Let's take food imports.
253	Every year Africa spends 20 billion dollars to import food.
260	Just add that up, all these leakages.
263	That's far more than the 50 billion Tony Blair wants to raise for Africa.
268	Now, back in the 1960s Africa not only fed itself,
271	it also exported food.
273	Not anymore.
276	We know that something has gone fundamentally wrong.
280	You know it, I know it, but let's not waste our time
283	talking about these mistakes because we'll spend all day here.
288	Let's move on, and flip over to the next chapter,
294	and that's what this conference is all about -- the next chapter.
298	The next chapter begins with first of all, asking ourselves
303	this fundamental question,
305	"""Whom do we want to help in Africa?"""
310	There is the people, and then there is the government or leaders.
316	Now, the previous speaker before me,
323	Idris Mohammed, indicated that
328	we've had abysmal leadership in Africa.
333	That characterization, in my view, is even more charitable.
338	(Laughter)
342	I belong to an Internet discussion forum,
345	an African Internet discussion forum,
349	"and I asked them, I said, ""Since 1960, we've had exactly"
359	And I asked them to name me just 20 good leaders,
363	just 20 good leaders --
366	you may want to take this leadership challenge yourself.
371	I asked them to name me just 20.
374	Everybody mentioned Nelson Mandela, of course.
377	Kwame Nkrumah, Nyerere, Kenyatta -- somebody mentioned Idi Amin.
384	(Laughter)
387	I let that pass.
389	(Laughter)
392	My point is, they couldn't go beyond 15.
398	Even if they had been able to name me 20,
401	what does that tell you?
410	of the African leaders failed their people.
415	And if you look at them, the slate of the post-colonial leaders --
421	an assortment of military fufu heads,
425	Swiss-bank socialists, crocodile liberators, vampire elites,
430	quack revolutionaries.
431	(Applause)
435	Now, this leadership is a far cry from the traditional leaders
439	that Africans have known for centuries.
442	The second false premise that we make
445	when we're trying to help Africa
446	is that sometimes we think that there is something called
452	a government in Africa that cares about its people,
458	serves the interests of the people, and represents the people.
464	There is one particular quote -- a Lesotho chief once said
469	"that ""Here in Lesotho, we've got two problems:"
471	"rats and the government."""
474	(Laughter)
478	What you and I understand as a government
481	doesn't exist in many African countries.
484	In fact, what we call our governments are vampire states.
489	Vampires because they suck
492	the economic vitality out of their people.
495	Government is the problem in Africa.
499	A vampire state is the government --
502	(Applause)
503	-- which has been hijacked by a phalanx of bandits and crooks
507	who use the instruments of state power to enrich themselves,
510	their cronies, and tribesmen and exclude everybody else.
515	The richest people in Africa are heads-of-state and ministers,
519	and quite often the chief bandit is the head-of-state himself.
525	Where do they get their money?
527	By creating wealth?
529	No.
530	By raking it off the backs of their suffering people.
534	That's not wealth creation. It's wealth redistribution.
540	The third fundamental issue that we have to recognize
545	is that if we want to help the African people,
550	we must know where the African people are.
553	Take any African economy.
556	An African economy can be broken up into three sectors.
559	There is the modern sector, there is the informal sector
565	and the traditional sector.
569	The modern sector is the abode of the elites.
572	It's the seat of government.
575	In many African countries the modern sector is lost.
579	It's dysfunctional.
581	It is a meretricious fandango of imported systems,
585	which the elites themselves don't understand.
589	That is the source of many of Africa's problems
593	where the struggles for political power emanate
597	and then spill over onto the informal and the traditional sector,
602	claiming innocent lives.
606	Now the modern sector, of course,
608	is where a lot of the development aid and resources went into.
614	More than 80 percent of Ivory Coast's development
617	went into the modern sector.
619	The other sectors, the informal and the traditional sectors,
625	are where you find the majority of the African people,
629	the real people in Africa. That's where you find them.
632	Now, obviously it makes common sense
634	that if you want to help the people, you go where the people are.
637	But that's not what we did.
639	As a matter of fact,
641	we neglected the informal and the traditional sectors.
648	Now, traditional sector is where Africa produces its agriculture,
652	which is one of the reasons why Africa can't feed itself,
655	and that's why it must import food.
659	All right, you cannot develop Africa by ignoring
663	the informal and the traditional sectors.
667	And you can't develop the informal and the traditional sectors
673	without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work.
679	These two sectors, let me describe to you,
681	have their own indigenous institutions.
684	First one is the political system.
688	Traditionally, Africans hate governments. They hate tyranny.
692	If you look into their traditional systems,
695	Africans organize their states in two types.
699	The first one belongs to those ethnic societies
704	who believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous,
708	so they didn't want to have anything to do
711	with any centralized authority.
716	These societies are the Ibo, the Somali, the Kikuyus,
719	for example. They have no chiefs.
722	The other ethnic groups, which did have chiefs,
726	made sure that they surrounded the chiefs
730	with councils upon councils upon councils
733	to prevent them from abusing their power.
738	In Ashanti tradition, for example,
741	the chief cannot make any decision
743	without the concurrence of the council of elders.
746	Without the council the chief can't pass any law,
749	and if the chief doesn't govern according to the will of the people
752	he will be removed.
754	If not, the people will abandon the chief,
758	go somewhere else and set up a new settlement.
760	And even if you look in ancient African empires,
764	they were all organized around one particular principle --
769	the confederacy principle,
771	which is characterized by a great deal of devolution of authority,
775	decentralization of power.
778	Now, this is what I have described to you.
780	This is part of Africa's indigenous political heritage.
784	Now, compare that to the modern systems
786	the ruling elites established on Africa.
790	It is a total far cry.
793	In the economic system in traditional Africa,
798	the means of production is privately owned.
801	It's owned by extended families.
804	You see, in the West, the basic economic and social unit
807	is the individual.
809	"The American will say, ""I am because I am,"
812	"and I can damn well do anything I want, anytime."""
814	"The accent is on the ""I."""
817	"In Africa, the Africans say, ""I am, because we are."""
821	"The ""we"" connotes community -- the extended family system."
825	The extended family system pools its resources together.
828	They own farms. They decide what to do, what to produce.
832	They don't take any orders from their chiefs.
835	They decide what to do.
837	And when they produce their crops, they sell the surplus
841	on marketplaces.
843	When they make a profit it is theirs to keep,
845	not for the chief to sequester it from them.
848	So, in a nutshell, what we had in traditional Africa
852	was a free-market system.
854	There were markets in Africa
856	before the colonialists stepped foot on the continent.
858	Timbuktu was one great big market town.
860	Kano, Salaga -- they were all there.
862	Even if you go to West Africa, you notice that market activity
866	in West Africa has always been dominated by women.
869	So, it's quite appropriate that this section is called
872	a marketplace.
873	The market is not alien to Africa.
876	What Africans practiced was a different form of capitalism,
880	but then after independence, all of a sudden,
883	markets, capitalism became a western institution,
887	and the leaders said Africans were ready for socialism.
892	Nonsense.
894	And even then, what kind of socialism did they practice?
897	The socialism that they practiced was a peculiar form of
900	Swiss-bank socialism,
902	which allowed the heads of states and the ministers
905	to rape and plunder Africa's
908	treasuries for deposit in Switzerland.
910	That is not the kind of system Africans had known for centuries.
914	What do we do now?
915	Go back to Africa's indigenous institutions,
918	and this is where we charge the Cheetahs to go into the informal sectors,
923	the traditional sectors.
924	That's where you find the African people.
926	And I'd like to show you a quick little video
929	about the informal sector, about the boat-building
932	that I, myself, tried to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora
937	to invest in.
938	Could you please show that?
968	The men are going fishing in these small boats.
971	Yes, it's an enterprise.
973	This is by a local Ghanaian entrepreneur, using his own capital.
978	He's getting no assistance from the government,
980	and he's building a second, bigger boat.
983	A bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed.
988	It means that he will be able to employ more Ghanaians.
991	It also means that he will be able to generate wealth.
995	And then it will have what economists call
999	external effects on a local economy.
1002	All that you need to do, all that the elites need to do,
1005	is to move this operation into something that is enclosed
1008	so that the operation can be made more efficient.
1011	Now, it is not just this informal sector.
1014	There is also traditional medicine.
1021	The modern healthcare sector has totally collapsed.
1025	Now, this is an area -- I mean, there is a treasure trove of wealth
1032	in the traditional medicine area.
1034	This is where we need to mobilize Africans,
1037	in the Diaspora especially, to invest in this.
1040	We also need to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora,
1043	not only to go into the traditional sectors,
1046	but to go into agriculture and also to instigate change from within.
1052	We were able to mobilize Ghanaians in the Diaspora
1056	to instigate change in Ghana and bring about democracy in Ghana.
1061	And I know that with the Cheetahs, we can take Africa back
1066	one village at a time.
1068	Thank you very much.
1069	(Applause)
