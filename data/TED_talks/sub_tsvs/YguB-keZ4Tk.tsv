15.26	This may sound strange,
17.26	but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
19.26	The first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868
22.26	with a very simple idea:
24.26	modules made of cement of a fixed measurement
27.26	that fit together.
29.26	Very quickly concrete blocks became
31.26	the most-used construction unit in the world.
34.26	They enabled us to to build things that were larger than us,
36.26	buildings, bridges,
38.26	one brick at a time.
40.26	Essentially concrete blocks had become
42.26	the building block of our time.
45.26	Almost a hundred years later in 1947,
47.26	LEGO came up with this.
49.26	It was called the Automatic Binding Brick.
52.26	And in a few short years,
54.26	LEGO bricks took place in every household.
57.26	It's estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced --
60.26	or 75 bricks for every person on the planet.
63.26	You don't have to be an engineer
65.26	to make beautiful houses, beautiful bridges, beautiful buildings.
68.26	LEGO made it accessible.
70.26	LEGO has essentially taken the concrete block, the building block of the world,
73.26	and made it into the building block
75.26	of our imagination.
77.26	Meanwhile the exact same year,
79.26	at Bell Labs the next revolution was about to be announced,
82.26	the next building block.
84.26	The transistor was a small plastic unit
86.26	that would take us from a world
88.26	of static bricks piled on top of each other
90.26	to a world where everything was interactive.
92.26	Like the concrete block,
94.26	the transistor allows you to build
96.26	much larger, more complex circuits, one brick at a time.
99.26	But there's a main difference:
101.26	The transistor was only for experts.
103.26	I personally don't accept this,
105.26	that the building block of our time
107.26	is reserved for experts,
109.26	so I decided to change that.
112.26	Eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab,
114.26	I started exploring this idea
116.26	of how to put the power of engineers
118.26	in the hands of artists and designers.
120.26	A few years ago I started developing littleBits.
123.26	Let me show you how they work.
127.26	LittleBits are electronic modules
130.26	with each one specific function.
133.26	They're pre-engineered
135.26	to be light, sound,
138.26	motors and sensors.
140.26	And the best part about it
142.26	is they snap together with magnets.
145.26	So you can't put them the wrong way.
148.26	The bricks are color-coded.
150.26	Green is output, blue is power,
153.26	pink is input and orange is wire.
155.26	So all you need to do is snap a blue to a green
158.26	and very quickly you can start making larger circuits.
161.26	You put a blue to a green,
163.26	you can make light.
165.26	You can put a knob in between
169.26	and now you've made a little dimmer.
172.26	Switch out the knob
175.26	for a pulse module,
177.26	which is here,
180.26	and now you've made a little blinker.
184.26	Add this buzzer
186.26	for some extra punch
188.26	and you've created a noise machine.
190.26	I'm going to stop that.
192.26	So beyond simple play,
195.26	littleBits are actually pretty powerful.
197.26	Instead of having to program, to wire, to solder,
200.26	littleBits allow you to program
202.26	using very simple intuitive gestures.
204.26	So to make this blink faster or slower,
206.26	you would just turn this knob
208.26	and basically make it pulse faster or slower.
211.26	The idea behind littleBits
213.26	is that it's a growing library.
215.26	We want to make every single interaction in the world
217.26	into a ready-to-use brick.
219.26	Lights, sounds, solar panels, motors --
221.26	everything should be accessible.
223.26	We've been giving littleBits to kids and seeing them play with them.
226.26	And it's been an incredible experience.
228.26	The nicest thing is how they start to understand
230.26	the electronics around them from everyday
232.26	that they don't learn at schools.
234.26	For example, how a nightlight works,
236.26	or why an elevator door stays open,
238.26	or how an iPod responds to touch.
241.26	We've also been taking littleBits to design schools.
243.26	So for example, we've had designers
246.26	with no experience with electronics whatsoever
248.26	start to play with littleBits as a material.
251.26	Here you see, with felt and paper water bottles,
254.26	we have Geordie making ...
256.26	(Clanging)
258.26	(Buzzing)
260.26	A few weeks ago we took littleBits to RISD
263.26	and gave them to some designers
265.26	with no experience in engineering whatsoever --
267.26	"just cardboard, wood and paper -- and told them ""Make something."""
270.26	Here's an example of a project they made,
272.26	a motion-activated confetti canon ball.
275.26	(Laughter)
277.26	But wait, this is actually my favorite project.
281.26	It's a lobster made of playdough
286.26	that's afraid of the dark.
288.26	(Laughter)
292.26	To these non-engineers, littleBits became another material,
295.26	electronics became just another material.
297.26	And we want to make this material accessible to everyone.
300.26	So littleBits is open-source.
302.26	You can go on the website, download all the design files, make them yourself.
305.26	We want to encourage a world
307.26	of creators, of inventors, of contributors,
310.26	because this world that we live in,
312.26	this interactive world, is ours.
314.26	So go ahead and start inventing.
316.26	Thank you.
318.26	(Applause)
