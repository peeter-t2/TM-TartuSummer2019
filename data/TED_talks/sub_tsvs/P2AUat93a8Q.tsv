12.928	Why do we cheat?
16.42	And why do happy people cheat?
20.641	"And when we say ""infidelity,"""
20.641	what exactly do we mean?
26.207	Is it a hookup, a love story,
26.207	paid sex, a chat room,
32.586	a massage with a happy ending?
36.356	Why do we think that men cheat
36.356	out of boredom and fear of intimacy,
41.494	but women cheat out of loneliness
41.494	and hunger for intimacy?
47.769	And is an affair always
47.769	the end of a relationship?
53.294	For the past 10 years,
53.294	I have traveled the globe
56.49	and worked extensively
56.49	with hundreds of couples
59.535	who have been shattered by infidelity.
62.999	There is one simple act of transgression
66.641	that can rob a couple
66.641	of their relationship,
71.015	their happiness and their
71.015	very identity: an affair.
75.903	And yet, this extremely common
75.903	act is so poorly understood.
82.593	So this talk is for anyone
82.593	who has ever loved.
89.681	Adultery has existed
89.681	since marriage was invented,
93.525	and so, too, the taboo against it.
97.094	In fact, infidelity has a tenacity
97.094	that marriage can only envy,
102.827	so much so, that this is
102.827	the only commandment
106.289	that is repeated twice in the Bible:
110.221	once for doing it, and once
110.221	just for thinking about it.
114.349	(Laughter)
116.619	So how do we reconcile
116.619	what is universally forbidden,
120.922	yet universally practiced?
125.058	Now, throughout history, men
125.058	practically had a license to cheat
130.036	with little consequence,
132.331	and supported by a host
132.331	of biological and evolutionary theories
136.739	that justified their need to roam,
139.315	so the double standard
139.315	is as old as adultery itself.
144.403	But who knows what's really going on
144.403	under the sheets there, right?
149.92	Because when it comes to sex,
151.776	the pressure for men
151.776	is to boast and to exaggerate,
155.939	but the pressure for women
155.939	is to hide, minimize and deny,
161.484	which isn't surprising when you consider
161.484	that there are still nine countries
165.71	where women can be killed for straying.
169.825	Now, monogamy used to be
169.825	one person for life.
174.912	Today, monogamy is one person at a time.
178.268	(Laughter)
180.158	(Applause)
184.364	I mean, many of you probably have said,
186.3	"""I am monogamous in all my relationships."""
189.46	(Laughter)
192.617	We used to marry,
194.26	and had sex for the first time.
196.614	But now we marry,
198.076	and we stop having sex with others.
201.455	The fact is that monogamy
201.455	had nothing to do with love.
206.332	Men relied on women's fidelity
208.919	in order to know whose children these are,
211.959	and who gets the cows when I die.
216.205	Now, everyone wants to know
218.655	what percentage of people cheat.
220.403	I've been asked that question
220.403	since I arrived at this conference.
223.658	(Laughter)
226.26	It applies to you.
228.466	But the definition of infidelity
228.466	keeps on expanding:
232.959	sexting, watching porn, staying
232.959	secretly active on dating apps.
238.332	So because there is no
238.332	universally agreed-upon definition
242.817	of what even constitutes an infidelity,
245.956	estimates vary widely,
245.956	from 26 percent to 75 percent.
252.728	But on top of it, we are
252.728	walking contradictions.
256.173	So 95 percent of us will say
256.173	that it is terribly wrong
259.792	for our partner to lie
259.792	about having an affair,
262.969	but just about the same
262.969	amount of us will say
265.214	that that's exactly what we
265.214	would do if we were having one.
268.372	(Laughter)
271.872	Now, I like this definition
271.872	of an affair --
275.577	it brings together the three key elements:
279.326	a secretive relationship,
279.326	which is the core structure of an affair;
285.032	an emotional connection
285.032	to one degree or another;
289.826	and a sexual alchemy.
292.355	And alchemy is the key word here,
295.337	because the erotic frisson is such that
295.337	the kiss that you only imagine giving,
302.265	can be as powerful and as enchanting
305.349	as hours of actual lovemaking.
309.759	As Marcel Proust said,
311.34	it's our imagination that is responsible
311.34	for love, not the other person.
317.902	So it's never been easier to cheat,
321.762	and it's never been more
321.762	difficult to keep a secret.
325.999	And never has infidelity exacted
325.999	such a psychological toll.
331.975	When marriage was an economic enterprise,
335.342	infidelity threatened
335.342	our economic security.
339.083	But now that marriage
339.083	is a romantic arrangement,
341.959	infidelity threatens
341.959	our emotional security.
345.779	Ironically, we used to turn to adultery --
350.04	that was the space where
350.04	we sought pure love.
353.293	But now that we seek love in marriage,
355.482	adultery destroys it.
358.943	Now, there are three ways that I think
358.943	infidelity hurts differently today.
365.8	We have a romantic ideal
365.8	in which we turn to one person
371.613	to fulfill an endless list of needs:
374.81	to be my greatest lover, my best friend,
378.41	the best parent, my trusted confidant,
381.563	my emotional companion,
381.563	my intellectual equal.
385.625	And I am it: I'm chosen, I'm unique,
389.929	I'm indispensable, I'm irreplaceable,
393.245	I'm the one.
395.356	And infidelity tells me I'm not.
399.308	It is the ultimate betrayal.
401.999	Infidelity shatters
401.999	the grand ambition of love.
406.68	But if throughout history,
406.68	infidelity has always been painful,
411.561	today it is often traumatic,
413.919	because it threatens our sense of self.
417.054	So my patient Fernando, he's plagued.
419.847	"He goes on: ""I thought I knew my life."
422.595	I thought I knew who you were,
422.595	who we were as a couple, who I was.
426.801	"Now, I question everything."""
429.632	Infidelity -- a violation of trust,
429.632	a crisis of identity.
434.819	"""Can I ever trust you again?"" he asks."
437.148	"""Can I ever trust anyone again?"""
440.824	And this is also what my patient
440.824	Heather is telling me,
443.905	when she's talking to me
443.905	about her story with Nick.
446.532	Married, two kids.
447.982	Nick just left on a business trip,
450.659	and Heather is playing
450.659	on his iPad with the boys,
454.19	when she sees a message
454.19	appear on the screen:
457.127	"""Can't wait to see you."""
459.625	Strange, she thinks,
459.625	we just saw each other.
462.863	And then another message:
464.903	"""Can't wait to hold you in my arms."""
467.999	And Heather realizes
470.243	these are not for her.
472.435	She also tells me
472.435	that her father had affairs,
475.812	but her mother, she found
475.812	one little receipt in the pocket,
479.777	and a little bit of lipstick
479.777	on the collar.
483.221	Heather, she goes digging,
486.61	and she finds hundreds of messages,
489.673	and photos exchanged
489.673	and desires expressed.
493.42	The vivid details
493.42	of Nick's two-year affair
496.118	unfold in front of her in real time,
499.999	And it made me think:
501.272	Affairs in the digital age
501.272	are death by a thousand cuts.
507.854	But then we have another paradox
507.854	that we're dealing with these days.
511.113	Because of this romantic ideal,
513.417	we are relying on our partner's
513.417	fidelity with a unique fervor.
518.999	But we also have never
518.999	been more inclined to stray,
522.544	and not because we have new desires today,
525.255	but because we live in an era
527.001	where we feel that we are
527.001	entitled to pursue our desires,
530.682	because this is the culture
530.682	where I deserve to be happy.
535.268	And if we used to divorce
535.268	because we were unhappy,
539.035	today we divorce
539.035	because we could be happier.
543.562	And if divorce carried all the shame,
546.847	today, choosing to stay when you can leave
550.738	is the new shame.
552.657	So Heather, she can't talk to her friends
555.168	because she's afraid that they
555.168	will judge her for still loving Nick,
558.429	and everywhere she turns,
558.429	she gets the same advice:
561.977	Leave him. Throw the dog on the curb.
565.744	And if the situation were reversed,
565.744	Nick would be in the same situation.
571.07	Staying is the new shame.
575.395	So if we can divorce,
578.359	why do we still have affairs?
581.999	Now, the typical assumption
581.999	is that if someone cheats,
586.563	either there's something wrong
586.563	in your relationship or wrong with you.
591.44	But millions of people
591.44	can't all be pathological.
596.383	The logic goes like this: If you
596.383	have everything you need at home,
600.291	then there is no need
600.291	to go looking elsewhere,
603.715	assuming that there is such
603.715	a thing as a perfect marriage
607.187	that will inoculate us against wanderlust.
611.165	But what if passion
611.165	has a finite shelf life?
615.624	What if there are things
615.624	that even a good relationship
619.338	can never provide?
622.187	If even happy people cheat,
625.202	what is it about?
628.765	The vast majority of people
628.765	that I actually work with
631.641	are not at all chronic philanderers.
634.429	They are often people who are
634.429	deeply monogamous in their beliefs,
638.475	and at least for their partner.
640.865	But they find themselves in a conflict
643.501	between their values and their behavior.
647.572	They often are people who have
647.572	actually been faithful for decades,
651.935	but one day they cross a line
654.574	that they never thought they would cross,
657.047	and at the risk of losing everything.
660.73	But for a glimmer of what?
663.969	Affairs are an act of betrayal,
666.609	and they are also an expression
666.609	of longing and loss.
670.61	At the heart of an affair,
670.61	you will often find
674.528	a longing and a yearning
674.528	for an emotional connection,
678.789	for novelty, for freedom,
678.789	for autonomy, for sexual intensity,
684.559	a wish to recapture
684.559	lost parts of ourselves
688.226	or an attempt to bring back
688.226	vitality in the face of loss and tragedy.
694.849	I'm thinking about
694.849	another patient of mine, Priya,
697.766	who is blissfully married,
700.382	loves her husband,
701.847	and would never want to hurt the man.
704.713	But she also tells me
706.831	that she's always done
706.831	what was expected of her:
710.005	good girl, good wife, good mother,
713.685	taking care of her immigrant parents.
716.677	Priya, she fell for the arborist
716.677	who removed the tree from her yard
721.214	after Hurricane Sandy.
723.524	And with his truck and his tattoos,
723.524	he's quite the opposite of her.
729.547	But at 47, Priya's affair is about
729.547	the adolescence that she never had.
735.753	And her story highlights for me
735.753	that when we seek the gaze of another,
741.03	it isn't always our partner
741.03	that we are turning away from,
745.748	but the person that
745.748	we have ourselves become.
749.728	And it isn't so much that we're
749.728	looking for another person,
753.274	as much as we are
753.274	looking for another self.
759.045	Now, all over the world,
760.602	there is one word that people
760.602	who have affairs always tell me.
765.03	They feel alive.
768.046	And they often will tell me
768.046	stories of recent losses --
772.286	of a parent who died,
774.141	and a friend that went too soon,
776.341	and bad news at the doctor.
779.482	Death and mortality often live
779.482	in the shadow of an affair,
784.138	because they raise these questions.
786.632	Is this it? Is there more?
789.901	Am I going on for another
793.87	Will I ever feel that thing again?
798.377	And it has led me to think
798.377	that perhaps these questions
802.788	are the ones that propel
802.788	people to cross the line,
805.947	and that some affairs are
805.947	an attempt to beat back deadness,
809.939	in an antidote to death.
813.999	And contrary to what you may think,
816.867	affairs are way less about sex,
816.867	and a lot more about desire:
821.903	desire for attention,
821.903	desire to feel special,
825.392	desire to feel important.
828.237	And the very structure of an affair,
831.247	the fact that you can
831.247	never have your lover,
833.503	keeps you wanting.
834.938	That in itself is a desire machine,
837.959	because the incompleteness, the ambiguity,
840.747	keeps you wanting
840.747	that which you can't have.
845.641	Now some of you probably think
847.177	that affairs don't happen
847.177	in open relationships,
850.807	but they do.
852.432	First of all, the conversation
852.432	about monogamy is not the same
855.562	as the conversation about infidelity.
858.468	But the fact is that it seems
858.468	that even when we have
861.959	the freedom to have other sexual partners,
864.632	we still seem to be lured
864.632	by the power of the forbidden,
868.72	that if we do that which
868.72	we are not supposed to do,
872.207	then we feel like we are really
872.207	doing what we want to.
877.331	And I've also told
877.331	quite a few of my patients
880.935	that if they could bring
880.935	into their relationships
885.536	one tenth of the boldness,
885.536	the imagination and the verve
889.167	that they put into their affairs,
890.879	they probably would never need to see me.
893.148	(Laughter)
896.362	So how do we heal from an affair?
900.428	Desire runs deep.
902.371	Betrayal runs deep.
905.266	But it can be healed.
907.999	And some affairs are death knells
910.944	for relationships that were
910.944	already dying on the vine.
914.753	But others will jolt us
914.753	into new possibilities.
917.953	The fact is, the majority of couples
919.936	who have experienced
919.936	affairs stay together.
922.766	But some of them will merely survive,
925.399	and others will actually be able
925.399	to turn a crisis into an opportunity.
930.817	They'll be able to turn this
930.817	into a generative experience.
934.484	And I'm actually thinking even
934.484	more so for the deceived partner,
938.222	who will often say,
939.558	"""You think I didn't want more?"
941.365	"But I'm not the one who did it."""
943.968	But now that the affair is exposed,
946.11	they, too, get to claim more,
948.244	and they no longer have
948.244	to uphold the status quo
950.886	that may not have been working
950.886	for them that well, either.
956.221	I've noticed that a lot of couples,
959.11	in the immediate aftermath of an affair,
961.251	because of this new disorder
961.251	that may actually lead to a new order,
965.587	will have depths of conversations
965.587	with honesty and openness
969.169	that they haven't had in decades.
971.743	And, partners who were
971.743	sexually indifferent
974.68	find themselves suddenly
974.68	so lustfully voracious,
977.279	they don't know where it's coming from.
980.568	Something about the fear
980.568	of loss will rekindle desire,
984.521	and make way for an entirely
984.521	new kind of truth.
990.133	So when an affair is exposed,
993.004	what are some of the specific things
993.004	that couples can do?
998.133	We know from trauma that healing begins
1002.204	when the perpetrator
1002.204	acknowledges their wrongdoing.
1007.339	So for the partner who had the affair,
1011.05	for Nick,
1012.582	one thing is to end the affair,
1014.387	but the other is the essential,
1014.387	important act of expressing
1019.109	guilt and remorse for hurting his wife.
1022.889	But the truth is
1024.264	that I have noticed that quite a lot
1024.264	of people who have affairs
1027.365	may feel terribly guilty
1027.365	for hurting their partner,
1030.463	but they don't feel guilty
1030.463	for the experience of the affair itself.
1034.135	And that distinction is important.
1037.23	And Nick, he needs to hold
1037.23	vigil for the relationship.
1041.253	He needs to become, for a while,
1041.253	the protector of the boundaries.
1044.326	It's his responsibility to bring it up,
1046.949	because if he thinks about it,
1048.929	he can relieve Heather from the obsession,
1051.939	and from having to make sure
1051.939	that the affair isn't forgotten,
1055.149	and that in itself
1055.149	begins to restore trust.
1059.57	But for Heather,
1061.429	or deceived partners,
1063.174	it is essential to do things
1063.174	that bring back a sense of self-worth,
1068.512	to surround oneself with love
1068.512	and with friends and activities
1072.249	that give back joy
1072.249	and meaning and identity.
1075.936	But even more important,
1077.869	is to curb the curiosity
1077.869	to mine for the sordid details --
1082.772	Where were you? Where did you do it?
1084.969	How often? Is she better
1084.969	than me in bed? --
1087.991	questions that only inflict more pain,
1090.475	and keep you awake at night.
1092.674	And instead, switch to what I call
1092.674	the investigative questions,
1097.35	the ones that mine
1097.35	the meaning and the motives --
1100.654	What did this affair mean for you?
1103.127	What were you able to express
1103.127	or experience there
1105.899	that you could no longer do with me?
1108.154	What was it like for you
1108.154	when you came home?
1111.186	What is it about us that you value?
1114.585	Are you pleased this is over?
1118.404	Every affair will redefine a relationship,
1122.725	and every couple will determine
1125.607	what the legacy of the affair will be.
1129.649	But affairs are here to stay,
1129.649	and they're not going away.
1134.316	And the dilemmas of love and desire,
1136.959	they don't yield just simple answers
1136.959	of black and white and good and bad,
1142.929	and victim and perpetrator.
1146.221	Betrayal in a relationship
1146.221	comes in many forms.
1150.296	There are many ways
1150.296	that we betray our partner:
1152.65	with contempt, with neglect,
1154.819	with indifference, with violence.
1157.999	Sexual betrayal is only
1157.999	one way to hurt a partner.
1161.437	In other words, the victim of an affair
1164.041	is not always the victim of the marriage.
1169.84	Now, you've listened to me,
1172.048	and I know what you're thinking:
1174.423	She has a French accent,
1174.423	she must be pro-affair.
1178.697	(Laughter)
1183.761	So, you're wrong.
1185.619	I am not French.
1187.666	(Laughter)
1190.143	(Applause)
1193.602	And I'm not pro-affair.
1196.674	But because I think that good
1196.674	can come out of an affair,
1201.058	I have often been asked
1201.058	this very strange question:
1204.413	Would I ever recommend it?
1207.514	Now, I would no more
1207.514	recommend you have an affair
1210.505	than I would recommend you have cancer,
1213.049	and yet we know that people
1213.049	who have been ill
1215.752	often talk about how their illness
1215.752	has yielded them a new perspective.
1220.569	The main question that I've been asked
1220.569	since I arrived at this conference
1223.906	when I said I would talk
1223.906	about infidelity is, for or against?
1228.488	"I said, ""Yes."""
1230.162	(Laughter)
1233.868	I look at affairs from a dual perspective:
1237.505	hurt and betrayal on one side,
1241.153	growth and self-discovery on the other --
1244.509	what it did to you,
1244.509	and what it meant for me.
1248.621	And so when a couple comes to me
1248.621	in the aftermath of an affair
1253.289	that has been revealed,
1255.092	I will often tell them this:
1257.42	Today in the West,
1259.825	most of us are going to have
1259.825	two or three relationships
1264.704	or marriages,
1266.403	and some of us are going
1266.403	to do it with the same person.
1270.666	Your first marriage is over.
1273.633	Would you like to create
1273.633	a second one together?
1277.164	Thank you.
1278.619	(Applause)
