12.895	I'm an industrial engineer.
14.631	The goal in my life has always been to make
17.428	more and more products
18.9	in the least amount of time and resources.
21.41	While working at Toyota,
22.91	all I knew was how to make cars
24.875	until I met Dr. Akira Miyawaki,
27.328	who came to our factory to make a forest in it
30.511	in order to make it carbon-neutral.
33.346	I was so fascinated
35.22	that I decided to learn this methodology
37.666	by joining his team as a volunteer.
40.557	Soon, I started making a forest
42.379	in the backyard of my own house,
44.843	and this is how it looks after three years.
48.776	These forests,
49.91	compared to a conventional plantation,
51.96	grow 10 times faster,
54.382	they're 30 times more dense,
56.969	and 100 times more biodiverse.
60.94	Within two years of having this forest in our backyard,
63.8	I could observe that the groundwater
65.744	didn't dry during summers,
67.623	the number of bird species I spotted in this area
70.48	doubled.
71.65	Quality of air became better,
73.026	and we started harvesting seasonal fruits
75.587	growing effortlessly
77.319	right in the backyard of our house.
79.93	I wanted to make more of these forests.
82.247	I was so moved by these results
83.665	that I wanted to make these forests
85.689	with the same acumen with which we make cars
88.479	or write software or do any mainstream business,
91.899	so I founded a company
93.743	which is an end-to-end service provider
95.59	to create these native natural forests.
98.935	But to make afforestation as a mainstream business
102.13	or an industry, we had to standardize
104.289	the process of forest-making.
106.202	So we benchmarked the Toyota Production System
108.902	known for its quality and efficiency
111.916	for the process of forest-making.
113.849	For an example, the core of TPS,
116.411	Toyota Production System, lies in heijunka,
119.751	which is making manufacturing
121.341	of different models of cars
123.79	on a single assembly line.
125.881	We replaced these cars with trees,
128.727	using which now we can make multi-layered forests.
131.65	These forests utilize 100 percent vertical space.
135.218	They are so dense
135.967	that one can't even walk into them.
139.516	For an example, we can make a 300-tree forest
142.75	in an area as small as the parking spaces of six cars.
147.204	In order to reduce cost and our own carbon footprint,
151.284	we started utilizing local biomass
153.279	as soil amender and fertilizers.
156.046	For example, coconut shells crushed in a machine
158.814	mixed with rice straw,
162.437	powder of rice husk mixed with organic manure
166.04	is finally dumped in soil on which
168.321	our forest is planted.
169.658	Once planted, we use grass or rice straw
172.887	to cover the soil
174.619	so that all the water which goes into irrigation
177.173	doesn't get evaporated back into the atmosphere.
179.866	And using these simple improvisations,
181.796	today we can make a forest
183.495	for a cost as low as the cost of an iPhone.
187.361	Today, we are making forests in houses,
189.814	in schools, even in factories with the corporates.
193.882	But that's not enough.
195.86	There is a huge number of people
197.812	who want to take matters into their own hands.
200.681	So we let it happen.
202.545	Today, we are working on an Internet-based platform
206.785	where we are going to share our methodology
209.362	on an open source
211.319	using which anyone and everyone
212.77	can make their own forest
214.28	without our physical presence being there,
216.802	using our methodology.
218.755	At the click of a button,
220.01	they can get to know all the native species
221.56	of their place.
223.778	By installing a small hardware probe on site,
227.596	we can do remote soil testing,
230.296	using which we can give step-by-step instructions
234.101	on forest-making remotely.
237.005	Also we can monitor the growth of this forest
239.917	without being on site.
243.566	This methodology, I believe,
245.117	has a potential.
246.862	By sharing, we can actually
246.862	bring back our native forests.
249.695	Now, when you go back home,
251.342	if you see a barren piece of land,
253.045	do remember that it can be a potential forest.
256.638	Thank you very much. Thanks.
258.828	(Applause)
