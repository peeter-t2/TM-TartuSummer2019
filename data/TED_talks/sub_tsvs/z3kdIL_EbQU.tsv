13.504	When you walk around
13.504	the place where you live,
15.921	most of the times,
17.374	you feel pretty safe
17.374	and comfortable, right?
20.839	Now imagine if there were land mines
23.936	buried right here,
26.133	scattered around,
27.785	and you'd never know
27.785	when you might step on one.
32.1	That's how it is for many
32.1	in my home country, Colombia.
35.393	As a result of a 50-year
35.393	internal armed conflict,
39.147	we have an undetermined
39.147	number of land mines
41.608	buried throughout the countryside,
43.529	affecting more than one third
43.529	of the Colombian population.
48.186	These anti-personnel mines
51.454	are designed to maim,
51.454	not to kill their targets.
55.769	The logic behind this, which is awful,
59.194	is that more resources are taken up
59.194	caring for an injured soldier
63.794	than dealing with a person
63.794	who has been killed.
67.348	I met Adriana Rodriguez
67.348	about five years ago
71.815	while I was working
71.815	for the Colombian government
74.106	as a documentary filmmaker.
76.374	During the conflict,
78.054	she was forced to leave her house ...
81.268	with her kids in her arms.
84.118	One day, one of her neighbors was killed
87.484	while he stepped on a land mine.
92.406	He was actually inside
92.406	an abandoned house, not outside,
96.582	a house exactly like the one
96.582	Adriana was forced to leave.
100.442	Ever since, she has been living
100.442	with the fear that she, or her children,
104.885	might step on a land mine.
107.855	You know, the Colombian conflict
107.855	has been running for so long
111.092	that neither me nor my mom
111.092	have seen our country in peace,
116.481	and for someone like me,
117.973	who has been living detached
117.973	from all this suffering,
121.458	there was only two options:
124.778	either I get used to it,
126.835	or I can try to change it
126.835	with all my heart.
131.989	And I have to admit
131.989	that for almost 30 years,
134.672	I was getting used to it, you know?
138.694	But something changed for me
138.694	when I met my wife.
142.614	She is a political scientist
144.473	completely passionate
144.473	about the Colombian armed conflict.
148.083	She helped me to understand
150.068	how deeply our country has
150.068	been affected by land mines and by war.
155.166	We decided to come here
155.166	to the United States
157.783	in search of new skills
159.855	that would enable us to contribute
159.855	in a fair way to our society,
164.109	and maybe even help heal it.
167.364	While in grad school,
168.559	I started developing
169.793	an augmented reality,
169.793	really broad application
172.857	to help military personnel
172.857	to deactivate land mines more safely.
177.583	During that time, I also realized
180.235	that Colombia is not
180.235	the only country in the world
182.886	that has to worry about land mines.
186.724	In fact, more than 58 countries
189.593	are still contaminated
189.593	with any sort of explosive device.
194.101	Only in 2015, due to an escalation of war
197.697	in countries like Libya,
197.697	Syria, Ukraine and Yemen,
201.752	the number of [land mine
201.752	casualties] almost doubled,
204.372	from 3,695 to 6,461 people.
211.051	Imagine that.
212.259	While some countries
212.259	are trying to get rid of land mines,
215.219	some others are increasing their use.
218.648	But what happens when a conflict
218.648	that involved land mines
222.768	comes to an end?
224.782	There are two consequences.
226.989	On the one hand,
228.672	the internally displaced population
228.672	will start returning to their lands,
233.384	and on the other hand,
235.256	hidden land mines are going
235.256	to start exploding more often
238.915	on the civilian side.
241.033	That's the reason why I decided to join
243.827	the Computer Science Department at NYU,
246.438	along with Professor Claudio Silva
249.151	to start to develop an app
249.151	called MineSafe.
252.831	MineSafe uses information
252.831	from the community
258.38	to suggest paths that have been declared
258.38	as the most transited
262.895	without accident or incident
262.895	caused by a land mine.
267.035	These traffic patterns
267.035	can also be used to determine
270.686	the top priority zones to be de-mined.
275.666	Almost 15 million people are living now
275.666	in the countryside of Colombia.
281.085	Imagine, for a moment, if we can
281.085	crowdsource information from all of them
285.611	to help people like Adriana
285.611	and her children
288.705	to find safe and reliable paths.
291.222	This information
291.222	can not only be used for that.
294.032	This information can also help them
294.032	to become more productive.
298.379	Farmers will be able to find
300.533	which lands have been cleared
300.533	from explosive devices,
304.57	and in that way, they will be able
304.57	to find new, fertile grounds
309.857	to start growing food again.
313.212	MineSafe has now a partnership
313.212	with the Colombian government
316.579	for the initial pilot,
318.396	and we have now some connections
318.396	with Cambodia and Somalia as well.
323.485	This project is being funded
323.485	by private money
325.913	here in the United States,
327.859	but we don't want to stop here.
329.708	We want to go big,
331.256	and we want to scale the project
331.256	to every single place
334.603	where land mines are still a threat.
338.709	The Colombian armed conflict
338.709	is finally coming to an end,
343.255	but the consequences of years of war
343.255	are still buried under our feet.
348.887	We at MineSafe are working
348.887	to help both people and land
354.191	to find peace.
355.848	Thank you.
357.023	(Applause)
