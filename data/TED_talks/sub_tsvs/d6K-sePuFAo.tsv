13.037	Alec Soth: So about 10 years ago,
13.037	I got a call from a woman in Texas,
16.682	Stacey Baker,
18.354	and she'd seen some of my photographs
18.354	in an art exhibition
22.116	and was wondering if she could commission
22.116	me to take a portrait of her parents.
27.892	Now, at the time I hadn't met Stacey,
27.892	and I thought this was some sort of
31.335	wealthy oil tycoon and I'd struck it rich,
35.367	but it was only later that I found out
37.242	she'd actually taken out a loan
37.242	to make this happen.
41.409	I took the picture of her parents,
43.076	but I was actually more excited
43.076	about photographing Stacey.
47.074	The picture I made that day
48.832	ended up becoming
48.832	one of my best-known portraits.
53.566	At the time I made this picture,
53.566	Stacey was working as an attorney
57.031	for the State of Texas.
58.686	Not long after, she left her job
58.686	to study photography in Maine,
63.386	and while she was there,
63.386	she ended up meeting
65.651	the director of photography
65.651	at the New York Times Magazine
68.786	and was actually offered a job.
72.153	Stacey Baker: In the years since,
72.153	Alec and I have done
74.982	a number of magazine projects together,
77.214	and we've become friends.
79.165	A few months ago, I started talking
79.165	to Alec about a fascination of mine.
83.948	I've always been obsessed
83.948	with how couples meet.
87.338	I asked Alec how he
87.338	and his wife Rachel met,
90.31	and he told me the story
90.31	of a high school football game
93.166	where she was 16 and he was 15,
96.091	and he asked her out.
98.181	He liked her purple hair.
100.015	She said yes, and that was it.
103.173	I then asked Alec if he'd be interested
103.173	in doing a photography project
107.469	exploring this question.
109.28	AS: And I was interested in the question,
109.28	but I was actually much more interested
113.32	in Stacey's motivation for asking it,
116.796	particularly since I'd never known
116.796	Stacey to have a boyfriend.
120.727	So as part of this project,
120.727	I thought it'd be interesting
123.513	if she tried to meet someone.
125.626	So my idea was to have Stacey here
125.626	go speed dating
130.471	in Las Vegas on Valentine's Day.
134.542	(Laughter) (Applause) (Music)
140.463	SB: We ended up at what was advertised
140.463	as the world's largest speed dating event.
145.664	I had 19 dates
147.684	and each date lasted three minutes.
150.679	Participants were given a list of ice-
150.679	breaker questions to get the ball rolling,
154.616	"things like, ""If you could be any kind"
154.616	"of animal, what would you be?"""
158.563	That sort of thing.
160.444	My first date was Colin.
162.858	He's from England,
164.669	and he once married a woman he met
164.669	after placing an ad for a Capricorn.
169.824	Alec and I saw him
169.824	at the end of the evening,
172.169	and he said he'd kissed a woman in line
172.169	at one of the concession stands.
177.092	Zack and Chris came
177.092	to the date-a-thon together.
182.838	This is Carl.
185.239	"I asked Carl, ""What's the first thing"
185.239	"you notice about a woman?"""
190.663	"He said, ""Tits."""
192.753	(Laughter)
197.35	Matthew is attracted to women
197.35	with muscular calves.
200.554	We talked about running. He does
200.554	triathlons, I run half-marathons.
204.385	Alec actually liked his eyes and asked
204.385	if I was attracted to him, but I wasn't,
209.238	and I don't think he was
209.238	attracted to me either.
213.349	Austin and Mike came together.
216.715	Mike asked me a hypothetical question.
219.338	"He said, ""You're in an elevator"
219.338	running late for a meeting.
223.959	Someone makes a dash for the elevator.
226.397	"Do you hold it open for them?"""
229.346	And I said I would not.
231.343	(Laughter)
235.766	Cliff said the first thing he notices
235.766	about a woman is her teeth,
239.818	and we complimented each other's teeth.
242.813	Because he's an open mouth sleeper,
245.181	he says he has to floss more
245.181	to help prevent gum disease,
249.384	and so I asked him how often he flosses,
251.799	"and he said, ""Every other day."""
254.399	(Laughter)
257.534	Now, as someone who flosses twice a day,
259.972	I wasn't really sure that
259.972	that was flossing more
262.372	but I don't think I said that out loud.
264.894	Bill is an auditor,
267.936	and we talked the entire three minutes
267.936	about auditing. (Laughter)
274.669	The first thing Spencer notices
274.669	about a woman is her complexion.
278.64	He feels a lot of women
278.64	wear too much makeup,
281.333	and that they should only wear enough
281.333	to accentuate the features that they have.
285.164	I told him I didn't wear any makeup at all
287.231	and he seemed to think
287.231	that that was a good thing.
291.317	Craig told me he didn't think
291.317	I was willing to be vulnerable.
295.404	He was also frustrated when I couldn't
295.404	remember my most embarrassing moment.
300.466	He thought I was lying, but I wasn't.
302.768	I didn't think he liked me at all,
302.768	but at the end of the night,
305.852	he came back to me and he gave me
305.852	a box of chocolates.
309.846	William was really difficult to talk to.
312.54	I think he was drunk.
314.676	(Laughter)
317.601	Actor Chris McKenna
317.601	was the MC of the event.
320.875	He used to be on
320.875	"""The Young and the Restless."""
323.336	I didn't actually go on a date with him.
326.076	Alec said he saw several women
326.076	give their phone numbers to him.
330.791	Needless to say, I didn't fall in love.
335.62	I didn't feel a particular connection with
335.62	any of the men that I went on dates with,
339.614	and I didn't feel like they felt
339.614	a particular connection with me either.
345.302	AS: Now, the most beautiful thing to me --
348.043	(Laughter) -- as a photographer
348.043	is the quality of vulnerability.
353.626	The physical exterior reveals a crack
353.626	in which you can get a glimpse
357.33	at a more fragile interior.
360.511	At this date-a-thon event,
360.511	I saw so many examples of that,
363.878	but as I watched Stacey's dates
363.878	and talked to her about them,
368.499	I realized how different
368.499	photographic love is from real love.
374.512	What is real love? How does it work?
378.162	In order to work on this question
378.162	and to figure out how someone goes
382.504	from meeting on a date
382.504	to having a life together,
387.078	Stacey and I went to Sun City Summerlin,
389.632	which is the largest
389.632	retirement community in Las Vegas.
395.019	Our contact there was George,
395.019	who runs the community's photography club.
399.639	He arranged for us to meet other couples
399.639	in their makeshift photo studio.
404.447	SB: After 45 years of marriage,
404.447	Anastasia's husband died two years ago,
409.515	so we asked if she had
409.515	an old wedding picture.
412.667	She met her husband
412.667	when she was a 15-year-old waitress
416.08	at a small barbecue place in Michigan.
418.565	He was 30.
420.237	She'd lied about her age.
422.512	He was the first person she'd dated.
425.321	Dean had been named photographer of
425.321	the year in Las Vegas two years in a row,
429.78	and this caught Alec's attention,
431.66	as did the fact 
431.66	that he met his wife, Judy,
434.238	at the same age when Alec met Rachel.
437.767	Dean admitted that he likes
437.767	to look at beautiful women,
440.739	but he's never questioned
440.739	his decision to marry Judy.
444.686	AS: George met Josephine
444.686	at a parish dance.
447.054	He was 18, she was 15.
449.562	Like a lot of the couples we met,
449.562	they weren't especially philosophical
453.115	about their early choices.
455.46	George said something
455.46	that really stuck with me.
458.041	"He said, ""When you get that feeling,"
458.041	"you just go with it."""
466.142	Bob and Trudy met on a blind date
466.142	when she was still in high school.
469.675	They said they weren't particularly
469.675	attracted to each other
472.445	when the first met.
473.865	Nevertheless, they were
473.865	married soon after.
477.113	SB: The story that stayed with me the most
479.528	was that of George, the photography club
479.528	president, and his wife, Mary.
484.265	This was George and Mary's
484.265	second marriage.
487.655	They met at a country-western club
487.655	in Louisville, Kentucky called the Sahara.
492.345	He was there alone drinking
492.345	and she was with friends.
496.083	When they started dating,
496.083	he owed the IRS 9,000 dollars in taxes,
501.795	and she offered to help him
501.795	get out of debt,
504.326	so for the next year, he turned
504.326	his paychecks over to Mary,
508.296	and she got him out of debt.
510.804	George was actually an alcoholic
510.804	when they married, and Mary knew it.
515.239	At some point in their marriage,
515.239	he says he consumed
521.601	Another time, when he was drunk,
521.601	he threatened to kill Mary
524.434	and her two kids,
525.966	but they escaped and a SWAT team
525.966	was called to the house.
530.412	Amazingly, Mary took him back,
532.583	and eventually things got better.
534.905	George has been involved
534.905	in Alcoholics Anonymous
537.761	and hasn't had a drink in 36 years.
540.664	(Music)
541.778	At the end of the day,
541.778	after we left Sun City,
544.125	I told Alec that I didn't actually think
546.539	that the stories of how these couples met
546.539	were all that interesting.
550.672	What was more interesting
552.878	was how they managed to stay together.
556.593	AS: They all had this beautiful
556.593	quality of endurance,
560.773	but that was true of the singles, too.
563.048	The world is hard,
563.048	and the singles were out there
566.856	trying to connect with other people,
569.201	and the couples
569.201	were holding onto each other
571.825	after all these decades.
575.842	My favorite pictures on this trip
575.842	were of Joe and Roseanne.
579.151	Now, by the time we met Joe and Roseanne,
581.395	we'd gotten in the habit of asking couples
581.395	if they had an old wedding photograph.
586.906	In their case, they simultaneously
586.906	pulled out of their wallets
591.712	the exact same photograph.
596.008	What's more beautiful,
596.008	I thought to myself,
599.142	this image of a young couple
599.142	who has just fallen in love
603.438	or the idea of these two people
603.438	holding onto this image for decades?
610.264	Thank you.
612.122	(Applause)
