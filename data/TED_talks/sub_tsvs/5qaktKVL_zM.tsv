13.387	I am a palliative care physician
14.936	and I would like to talk to you
14.936	today about health care.
18.393	I'd like to talk to you
18.393	about the health and care
22.917	of the most vulnerable
22.917	population in our country --
25.788	those people dealing with the most
25.788	complex serious health issues.
32.202	I'd like to talk to you
32.202	about economics as well.
35.028	And the intersection of these two
35.028	should scare the hell out of you --
39.508	it scares the hell out of me.
42.199	I'd also like to talk to you
42.199	about palliative medicine:
45.835	a paradigm of care for this population,
45.835	grounded in what they value.
52.544	Patient-centric care based on their values
55.765	that helps this population
55.765	live better and longer.
60.458	It's a care model that tells the truth
63.744	and engages one-on-one
65.008	and meets people where they're at.
69.46	I'd like to start by telling the story
69.46	of my very first patient.
73.247	It was my first day as a physician,
75.307	with the long white coat ...
77.519	I stumbled into the hospital
79.025	and right away there's a gentleman,
79.025	Harold, 68 years old,
81.849	came to the emergency department.
83.474	He had had headaches for about six weeks
85.481	that got worse and worse
85.481	and worse and worse.
88.46	Evaluation revealed he had cancer
88.46	that had spread to his brain.
93.148	The attending physician directed me
93.148	to go share with Harold and his family
99.791	the diagnosis, the prognosis
99.791	and options of care.
104.114	Five hours into my new career,
107.092	I did the only thing I knew how.
109.922	I walked in,
111.79	sat down,
113.717	took Harold's hand,
115.935	took his wife's hand
118.142	and just breathed.
120.5	"He said, ""It's not good"
120.5	"news is it, sonny?"""
123.132	"I said, ""No."""
124.564	And so we talked
124.564	and we listened and we shared.
128.867	And after a while I said,
130.124	"""Harold, what is it"
130.124	that has meaning to you?
133.373	"What is it that you hold sacred?"""
135.026	And he said,
136.365	"""My family."""
138.525	"I said, ""What do you want to do?"""
140.57	He slapped me on the knee
140.57	"and said, ""I want to go fishing."""
143.761	"I said, ""That, I know how to do."""
146.646	Harold went fishing the next day.
149.76	He died a week later.
152.455	As I've gone through
152.455	my training in my career,
155.098	I think back to Harold.
156.609	And I think that this is a conversation
160.782	that happens far too infrequently.
163.737	And it's a conversation
163.737	that had led us to crisis,
168.173	to the biggest threat
168.173	to the American way of life today,
170.861	which is health care expenditures.
173.926	So what do we know?
175.127	We know that
175.127	this population, the most ill,
178.08	takes up 15 percent
178.08	of the gross domestic product --
180.688	nearly 2.3 trillion dollars.
184.307	So the sickest 15 percent
184.307	take up 15 percent of the GDP.
187.891	If we extrapolate this out
187.891	over the next two decades
191.755	with the growth of baby boomers,
194.838	at this rate it is 60 percent of the GDP.
200.177	Sixty percent of the gross
200.177	domestic product
202.48	of the United States of America --
204.128	it has very little to do
204.128	with health care at that point.
207.148	It has to do with a gallon of milk,
209.54	with college tuition.
211.625	It has to do with
211.625	every thing that we value
214.112	and every thing that we know presently.
218.514	It has at stake the free-market
218.514	economy and capitalism
222.729	of the United States of America.
226.965	Let's forget all the statistics
226.965	for a minute, forget the numbers.
230.145	Let's talk about the value we get
230.145	for all these dollars we spend.
234.822	Well, the Dartmouth Atlas,
234.822	about six years ago,
237.439	looked at every dollar
237.439	spent by Medicare --
240.216	generally this population.
241.851	We found that those patients who have
241.851	the highest per capita expenditures
248.05	had the highest suffering,
248.05	pain, depression.
252.182	And, more often than not, they die sooner.
255.824	How can this be?
257.789	We live in the United States,
259.217	it has the greatest health care
259.217	system on the planet.
261.731	We spend 10 times more on these patients
264.26	than the second-leading
264.26	country in the world.
267.196	That doesn't make sense.
269.764	But what we know is,
271.147	out of the top 50 countries on the planet
274.342	with organized health care systems,
277.949	we rank 37th.
282.017	Former Eastern Bloc countries
282.017	and sub-Saharan African countries
286.327	rank higher than us
286.327	as far as quality and value.
292.485	Something I experience
292.485	every day in my practice,
295.047	and I'm sure, something many of you
295.047	on your own journeys have experienced:
299.927	more is not more.
304.196	Those individuals who had more tests,
306.209	more bells, more whistles,
307.503	more chemotherapy,
307.503	more surgery, more whatever --
309.955	the more that we do to someone,
313.283	it decreases the quality of their life.
317.422	And it shortens it, most often.
321.896	So what are we going to do about this?
323.745	What are we doing about this?
325.461	And why is this so?
327.097	The grim reality, ladies and gentlemen,
329.025	is that we, the health care industry --
329.025	long white-coat physicians --
332.447	are stealing from you.
334.877	Stealing from you the opportunity
337.974	to choose how you want to live your lives
340.358	in the context of whatever disease it is.
342.863	We focus on disease
342.863	and pathology and surgery
345.656	and pharmacology.
349.319	We miss the human being.
353.434	How can we treat this
354.985	without understanding this?
359.029	We do things to this;
362.948	we need to do things for this.
368.161	The triple aim of healthcare:
369.965	one, improve patient experience.
373.081	Two, improve the population health.
377.467	Three, decrease per capita expenditure
377.467	across a continuum.
383.591	Our group, palliative care,
385.358	in 2012, working with
385.358	the sickest of the sick --
391	cancer,
392.175	heart disease, lung disease,
394.017	renal disease,
395.192	dementia --
397.681	how did we improve patient experience?
401.01	"""I want to be at home, Doc."""
402.633	"""OK, we'll bring the care to you."""
404.868	Quality of life, enhanced.
407.732	Think about the human being.
409.114	Two: population health.
411.069	How did we look
411.069	at this population differently,
413.944	and engage with them
413.944	at a different level, a deeper level,
416.816	and connect to a broader sense
416.816	of the human condition than my own?
421.091	How do we manage this group,
424.584	so that of our outpatient population,
	never had to go to the hospital?
431.919	Not because they couldn't.
435.213	But they didn't have to.
437.022	We brought the care to them.
439.356	We maintained their value, their quality.
445.22	Number three: per capita expenditures.
448.746	For this population,
450.168	that today is 2.3 trillion dollars
450.168	and in 20 years is 60 percent of the GDP,
455.245	we reduced health care expenditures
455.245	by nearly 70 percent.
460.873	They got more of what they wanted
460.873	based on their values,
464.346	lived better and are living longer,
467.464	for two-thirds less money.
474.88	While Harold's time was limited,
477.663	palliative care's is not.
480.288	Palliative care is a paradigm
480.288	from diagnosis through the end of life.
486.677	The hours,
488.361	weeks, months, years,
491.916	across a continuum --
493.098	with treatment, without treatment.
495.006	Meet Christine.
497.196	Stage III cervical cancer,
499.151	so, metastatic cancer
499.151	that started in her cervix,
502.196	spread throughout her body.
504.719	She's in her 50s and she is living.
508.743	This is not about end of life,
510.36	this is about life.
513.18	This is not just about the elderly,
515.094	this is about people.
517.929	This is Richard.
519.706	End-stage lung disease.
522.427	"""Richard, what is it"
522.427	"that you hold sacred?"""
525.581	"""My kids, my wife and my Harley."""
529.094	(Laughter)
530.129	"""Alright!"
532.544	I can't drive you around on it
532.544	because I can barely pedal a bicycle,
535.806	"but let's see what we can do."""
538.385	Richard came to me,
540.946	and he was in rough shape.
544.444	He had this little voice telling him
546.249	that maybe his time was weeks to months.
549.488	And then we just talked.
550.778	And I listened and tried to hear --
554.891	big difference.
556.202	Use these in proportion to this.
560.479	"I said, ""Alright, let's take it"
560.479	"one day at a time,"""
563.028	like we do in every
563.028	other chapter of our life.
566.573	And we have met Richard
566.573	where Richard's at day-to-day.
571.006	And it's a phone call or two a week,
575.059	but he's thriving in the context
575.059	of end-stage lung disease.
583.04	Now, palliative medicine is not
583.04	just for the elderly,
585.557	it is not just for the middle-aged.
589.535	It is for everyone.
591.09	Meet my friend Jonathan.
593.903	We have the honor and pleasure
595.407	of Jonathan and his father
595.407	joining us here today.
597.751	Jonathan is in his 20s,
597.751	and I met him several years ago.
600.607	He was dealing with
600.607	metastatic testicular cancer,
604.7	spread to his brain.
606.465	He had a stroke,
608.375	he had brain surgery,
609.947	radiation, chemotherapy.
613.579	Upon meeting him and his family,
615.399	he was a couple of weeks away
615.399	from a bone marrow transplant,
618.254	and in listening and engaging,
620.539	"they said, ""Help us"
620.539	"understand -- what is cancer?"""
627.764	How did we get this far
630.513	without understanding
630.513	what we're dealing with?
633.276	How did we get this far
633.276	without empowering somebody
635.714	to know what it is they're dealing with,
637.65	and then taking the next step and engaging
637.65	in who they are as human beings
641.282	to know if that is what we should do?
643.402	Lord knows we can do
643.402	any kind of thing to you.
649.133	But should we?
653.87	And don't take my word for it.
655.578	All the evidence that is related
655.578	to palliative care these days
660.054	demonstrates with absolute certainty
660.054	people live better and live longer.
664.199	There was a seminal article
664.199	out of the New England Journal of Medicine
667.567	in 2010.
669.621	A study done at Harvard
669.621	by friends of mine, colleagues.
672.309	End-stage lung cancer:
673.714	one group with palliative care,
676.695	a similar group without.
679.782	The group with palliative care
679.782	reported less pain,
683.901	less depression.
685.556	They needed fewer hospitalizations.
688.487	And, ladies and gentlemen,
690.639	they lived three to six months longer.
695.805	If palliative care were a cancer drug,
699.867	every cancer doctor on the planet
699.867	would write a prescription for it.
704.845	Why don't they?
707.57	Again, because we goofy,
707.57	long white-coat physicians
710.938	are trained and of the mantra
710.938	of dealing with this,
716.401	not with this.
722.697	This is a space that we will
722.697	all come to at some point.
727.709	But this conversation today
727.709	is not about dying,
730.457	it is about living.
732.289	Living based on our values,
733.637	what we find sacred
735.08	and how we want to write
735.08	the chapters of our lives,
737.521	whether it's the last
739.379	or the last five.
742.258	What we know,
744.277	what we have proven,
746.475	is that this conversation
746.475	needs to happen today --
749.946	not next week, not next year.
752.029	What is at stake is our lives today
754.883	and the lives of us as we get older
756.707	and the lives of our children
756.707	and our grandchildren.
760.31	Not just in that hospital room
762.207	or on the couch at home,
764.141	but everywhere we go
764.141	and everything we see.
768.326	Palliative medicine is the answer
768.326	to engage with human beings,
773.57	to change the journey
773.57	that we will all face,
778.304	and change it for the better.
782.148	To my colleagues,
784.823	to my patients,
786.702	to my government,
788.303	to all human beings,
790.386	I ask that we stand and we
790.386	shout and we demand
794.641	the best care possible,
797.352	so that we can live better today
799.606	and ensure a better life tomorrow.
801.311	We need to shift today
804.452	so that we can live tomorrow.
808.838	Thank you very much.
810.013	(Applause)
