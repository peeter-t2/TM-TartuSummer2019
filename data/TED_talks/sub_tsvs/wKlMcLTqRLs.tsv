12.722	"""Why?"""
14.231	"""Why?"" is a question"
15.689	that parents ask me all the time.
18.325	"""Why did my child develop autism?"""
21.172	As a pediatrician, as a geneticist, as a researcher,
25.626	we try and address that question.
28.069	But autism is not a single condition.
30.018	It's actually a spectrum of disorders,
32.733	a spectrum that ranges, for instance,
35.267	from Justin, a 13-year-old boy
37.94	who's not verbal, who can't speak,
41.163	who communicates by using an iPad
43.125	to touch pictures to communicate
45.023	his thoughts and his concerns,
47.174	a little boy who, when he gets upset,
49.585	will start rocking,
51.233	and eventually, when he's disturbed enough,
52.83	will bang his head to the point
54.433	that he can actually cut it open and require stitches.
58.275	That same diagnosis of autism, though,
60.89	also applies to Gabriel,
62.812	another 13-year-old boy
64.779	who has quite a different set of challenges.
67.474	He's actually quite remarkably gifted in mathematics.
70.588	He can multiple three numbers by three numbers
72.609	in his head with ease,
74.396	yet when it comes to trying to have a conversation,
78.154	he has great difficulty.
80.215	He doesn't make eye contact.
82.274	He has difficulty starting a conversation,
84.397	feels awkward,
86.132	and when he gets nervous,
87.95	he actually shuts down.
89.675	Yet both of these boys
91.157	have the same diagnosis of
91.157	autism spectrum disorder.
95.341	One of the things that concerns us
97.769	is whether or not there really is
99.366	an epidemic of autism.
101.339	These days, one in 88 children
103.819	will be diagnosed with autism,
105.861	and the question is,
107.334	why does this graph look this way?
109.337	Has that number been increasing
111.304	dramatically over time?
113.238	Or is it because we have now started labeling
117.769	individuals with autism,
119.331	simply giving them a diagnosis
121.579	when they were still present there before
124.132	yet simply didn't have that label?
126.525	And in fact, in the late 1980s, the early 1990s,
130.516	legislation was passed
131.926	that actually provided individuals with autism
134.565	with resources, with access to educational materials
138.291	that would help them.
140.063	With that increased awareness, more parents,
143.551	more pediatricians, more educators
146.297	learned to recognize the features of autism.
149.552	As a result of that, more individuals were diagnosed
153.562	and got access to the resources they needed.
156.75	In addition, we've changed our definition over time,
160.182	so in fact we've widened the definition of autism,
163.32	and that accounts for some of
164.44	the increased prevalence that we see.
167.455	The next question everyone wonders is,
170.115	what caused autism?
171.891	And a common misconception
174.786	is that vaccines cause autism.
177.57	But let me be very clear:
180.621	Vaccines do not cause autism.
185.108	(Applause)
191.812	In fact, the original research study
193.935	that suggested that was the case
195.934	was completely fraudulent.
198.809	It was actually retracted from the journal Lancet,
201.985	in which it was published,
203.577	and that author, a physician,
205.467	had his medical license taken away from him.
208.721	(Applause)
212.675	The Institute of Medicine,
214.257	The Centers for Disease Control,
215.82	have repeatedly investigated this
218.164	and there is no credible evidence
221.771	that vaccines cause autism.
224.456	Furthermore,
226.093	one of the ingredients in vaccines,
228.562	something called thimerosal,
230.614	was thought to be what the cause of autism was.
233.93	That was actually removed from vaccines
236.193	in the year 1992,
237.918	and you can see that it really did not have an effect
240.962	in what happened with the prevalence of autism.
243.601	So again, there is no evidence
245.334	that this is the answer.
247.416	So the question remains, what does cause autism?
251.559	In fact, there's probably not one single answer.
254.39	Just as autism is a spectrum,
256.147	there's a spectrum of etiologies,
258.337	a spectrum of causes.
259.989	Based on epidemiological data,
261.98	we know that one of the causes,
263.773	or one of the associations, I should say,
265.93	is advanced paternal age,
268.214	that is, increasing age of the father
270.151	at the time of conception.
272.33	In addition, another vulnerable
274.474	and critical period in terms of development
277.104	is when the mother is pregnant.
279.01	During that period, while
279.01	the fetal brain is developing,
282	we know that exposure to certain agents
283.942	can actually increase the risk of autism.
287.027	In particular, there's a medication, valproic acid,
289.962	which mothers with epilepsy sometimes take,
292.548	we know can increase that risk of autism.
296.22	In addition, there can be some infectious agents
298.519	that can also cause autism.
301.419	And one of the things I'm going to spend
302.999	a lot of time focusing on
305.06	are the genes that can cause autism.
307.621	I'm focusing on this not because genes
310.077	are the only cause of autism,
312.221	but it's a cause of autism
313.79	that we can readily define
315.667	and be able to better understand the biology
318.46	and understand better how the brain works
320.729	so that we can come up with strategies
322.714	to be able to intervene.
325.044	One of the genetic factors that we don't understand,
327.99	however, is the difference that we see
331.138	in terms of males and females.
333.044	Males are affected four to one compared to females
336.049	with autism,
337.151	and we really don't understand what that cause is.
341.142	One of the ways that we can understand
342.86	that genetics is a factor
344.723	is by looking at something called
346.06	the concordance rate.
347.95	In other words, if one sibling has autism,
351.138	what's the probability
352.625	that another sibling in that family will have autism?
355.629	And we can look in particular
357.194	at three types of siblings:
359.362	identical twins,
361.233	twins that actually share 100 percent
363.452	of their genetic information
365.054	and shared the same intrauterine environment,
368.23	versus fraternal twins,
370.475	twins that actually share 50 percent
372.464	of their genetic information,
374.491	versus regular siblings,
375.707	brother-sister, sister-sister,
377.576	also sharing 50 percent of their genetic information,
380.444	yet not sharing the same intrauterine environment.
383.523	And when you look at those concordance ratios,
385.823	one of the striking things that you will see
387.88	is that in identical twins,
390	that concordance rate is 77 percent.
393.353	Remarkably, though,
394.457	it's not 100 percent.
396.605	It is not that genes account
396.605	for all of the risk for autism,
400.608	but yet they account for a lot of that risk,
402.849	because when you look at fraternal twins,
405.162	that concordance rate is only 31 percent.
408.238	On the other hand, there is a difference
410.149	between those fraternal twins and the siblings,
413.092	suggesting that there are common exposures
415.756	for those fraternal twins
417.179	that may not be shared as commonly
419.296	with siblings alone.
421.47	So this provides some of the data
423.156	that autism is genetic.
424.778	Well, how genetic is it?
426.742	When we compare it to other conditions
428.585	that we're familiar with,
430.197	things like cancer, heart disease, diabetes,
434.077	in fact, genetics plays a much larger role in autism
438.03	than it does in any of these other conditions.
440.47	But with this, that doesn't
440.47	tell us what the genes are.
443.812	It doesn't even tell us in any one child,
446.479	is it one gene
448.14	or potentially a combination of genes?
450.396	And so in fact, in some individuals with autism,
453.95	it is genetic!
456.464	That is, that it is one single,
458.694	powerful, deterministic gene
460.866	that causes the autism.
462.713	However, in other individuals,
464.507	it's genetic, that is,
466.213	that it's actually a combination of genes
469.333	in part with the developmental process
472.128	that ultimately determines that risk for autism.
475.508	We don't know in any one person, necessarily,
478.378	which of those two answers it is
480.471	until we start digging deeper.
482.512	So the question becomes,
483.799	how can we start to identify
486.04	what exactly those genes are.
487.912	And let me pose something
489.021	that might not be intuitive.
491.211	In certain individuals,
493.57	they can have autism
495.294	for a reason that is genetic
497.747	but yet not because of autism running in the family.
501.311	And the reason is because in certain individuals,
503.69	they can actually have genetic changes or mutations
506.751	that are not passed down from the mother
509.794	or from the father,
511.281	but actually start brand new in them,
514.014	mutations that are present
515.601	in the egg or the sperm
517.004	at the time of conception
518.617	but have not been passed down
520.359	generation through generation within the family.
523.365	And we can actually use that strategy
525.546	to now understand and to identify
527.88	those genes causing autism in those individuals.
530.98	So in fact, at the Simons Foundation,
532.99	we took 2,600 individuals
535.716	that had no family history of autism,
538.427	and we took that child and their mother and father
541.597	and used them to try and understand
544.068	what were those genes
545.687	causing autism in those cases?
548.005	To do that, we actually had to comprehensively
551.072	be able to look at all that genetic information
553.802	and determine what those differences were
555.984	between the mother, the father and the child.
559.685	In doing so, I apologize,
561.639	I'm going to use an outdated analogy
563.523	of encyclopedias rather than Wikipedia,
566.181	but I'm going to do so to try and help make the point
569.18	that as we did this inventory,
571.538	we needed to be able to look at
573.131	massive amounts of information.
575.304	Our genetic information is organized
577.591	into a set of 46 volumes,
580.478	and when we did that, we had to be able to account
582.387	for each of those 46 volumes,
584.371	because in some cases with autism,
586.224	there's actually a single volume that's missing.
588.68	We had to get more granular than that, though,
590.99	and so we had to start opening those books,
593.31	and in some cases, the genetic change
595.19	was more subtle.
596.578	It might have been a single
596.578	paragraph that was missing,
599.764	or yet, even more subtle than that,
603.042	a single letter,
604.734	one out of three billion letters
607.536	that was changed, that was altered,
609.81	yet had profound effects
611.407	in terms of how the brain functions
613.32	and affects behavior.
615.137	In doing this within these families,
617.514	we were able to account for approximately
622.157	and determine that there was a single
624.704	powerful genetic factor
626.9	that caused autism within those families.
630.024	On the other hand, there's 75 percent
632.276	that we still haven't figured out.
634.727	As we did this, though,
636.197	it was really quite humbling,
638.291	because we realized that there was not simply
640.656	one gene for autism.
642.597	In fact, the current estimates are
644.346	that there are 200 to 400 different genes
647.098	that can cause autism.
648.99	And that explains, in part,
650.359	why we see such a broad spectrum
652.476	in terms of its effects.
654.519	Although there are that many genes,
656.744	there is some method to the madness.
659.092	It's not simply random
663.27	but in fact they fit together.
665.064	They fit together in a pathway.
666.93	They fit together in a network
668.402	that's starting to make sense now
670.234	in terms of how the brain functions.
672.932	We're starting to have a bottom-up approach
675.078	where we're identifying those genes,
676.787	those proteins, those molecules,
679.265	understanding how they interact together
681.175	to make that neuron work,
682.572	understanding how those neurons interact together
685.309	to make circuits work,
686.528	and understand how those circuits work
688.544	to now control behavior,
690.37	and understand that both in individuals with autism
693.17	as well as individuals who have normal cognition.
697.071	But early diagnosis is a key for us.
699.529	Being able to make that diagnosis
701.488	of someone who's susceptible
702.995	at a time in a window
705.05	where we have the ability to transform,
707.397	to be able to impact
709	that growing, developing brain is critical.
711.74	And so folks like Ami Klin have developed methods
715.549	to be able to take infants, small babies,
718.117	and be able to use biomarkers,
720.65	in this case eye contact and eye tracking,
723.988	to identify an infant at risk.
726.074	This particular infant, you can see,
728.239	making very good eye contact with this woman
730.44	"as she's singing ""Itsy, Bitsy Spider,"""
732.8	in fact is not going to develop autism.
735.84	This baby we know is going to be in the clear.
738.72	On the other hand, this other baby
741.08	is going to go on to develop autism.
743.415	In this particular child, you can see,
745.642	it's not making good eye contact.
747.843	Instead of the eyes focusing in
749.81	and having that social connection,
752.088	looking at the mouth, looking at the nose,
754.726	looking off in another direction,
756.509	but not again socially connecting,
759.422	and being able to do this on a very large scale,
762.135	screen infants, screen children for autism,
765.135	through something very robust, very reliable,
768.059	is going to be very helpful to us in terms of being
770.775	able to intervene at an early stage
772.869	when we can have the greatest impact.
776.301	How are we going to intervene?
778.547	It's probably going to be a combination of factors.
781.377	In part, in some individuals,
783.416	we're going to try and use medications.
785.295	And so in fact, identifying the genes for autism
788.017	is important for us
789.543	to identify drug targets,
791.409	to identify things that we might be able to impact
794.032	and can be certain that that's really
795.73	what we need to do in autism.
797.425	But that's not going to be the only answer.
800.166	Beyond just drugs, we're going
800.166	to use educational strategies.
803.676	Individuals with autism,
804.951	some of them are wired a little bit differently.
807.248	They learn in a different way.
809.107	They absorb their surroundings in a different way,
811.441	and we need to be able to educate them
813.66	in a way that serves them best.
816.753	Beyond that, there are a lot of individuals
818.671	in this room who have great ideas
820.817	in terms of new technologies we can use,
823.361	everything from devices we can use to train the brain
826.48	to be able to make it more efficient
828.029	and to compensate for areas in which
829.702	it has a little bit of trouble,
831.296	to even things like Google Glass.
833.575	You could imagine, for instance, Gabriel,
835.359	with his social awkwardness,
837.18	might be able to wear Google Glass
838.638	with an earpiece in his ear,
840.169	and have a coach be able to help him,
842.096	be able to help think about conversations,
844.754	conversation-starters,
846.07	being able to even perhaps one day
848.181	invite a girl out on a date.
850.549	All of these new technologies
852.761	just offer tremendous opportunities
854.767	for us to be able to impact
856.672	the individuals with autism,
859.357	but yet we have a long way to go.
861.893	As much as we know,
863.203	there is so much more that we don't know,
866.16	and so I invite all of you
868.293	to be able to help us think about
870.535	how to do this better,
871.946	to use as a community our collective wisdom
874.825	to be able to make a difference,
876.631	and in particular,
877.888	for the individuals in families with autism,
880.592	I invite you to join the interactive autism network,
883.847	to be part of the solution to this,
886.041	because it's going to take really a lot of us
888.92	to think about what's important,
891.19	what's going to be a meaningful difference.
893.115	As we think about something
894.62	that's potentially a solution,
896.452	how well does it work?
898.111	Is it something that's really
898.111	going to make a difference
900.059	in your lives, as an individual,
902.428	as a family with autism?
904.081	We're going to need individuals of all ages,
906.501	from the young to the old,
908.228	and with all different shapes and sizes
910.387	of the autism spectrum disorder
912.224	to make sure that we can have an impact.
914.4	So I invite all of you to join the mission
916.605	and to help to be able to make the lives
919.579	of individuals with autism
921.265	so much better and so much richer.
923.196	Thank you.
925.921	(Applause)
