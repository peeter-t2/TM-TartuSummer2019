12.534	Back in 2003,
15.654	the UK government carried out a survey.
19.314	And it was a survey that measured
19.314	levels of numeracy
22.487	in the population.
23.748	And they were shocked to find out
25.415	that for every 100 working age
25.415	adults in the country,
32.712	Now, Level 1 numeracy skills --
32.712	that's low-end GCSE score.
37.23	It's the ability to deal with fractions,
37.23	percentages and decimals.
40.502	So this figure prompted
40.502	a lot of hand-wringing in Whitehall.
45.154	Policies were changed,
46.806	investments were made,
48.552	and then they ran
48.552	the survey again in 2011.
51.614	So can you guess
51.614	what happened to this number?
55.841	It went up to 49.
57.309	(Laughter)
58.782	And in fact, when I reported
58.782	this figure in the FT,
61.255	one of our readers joked and said,
62.95	"""This figure is only shocking"
62.95	"to 51 percent of the population."""
66.735	(Laughter)
69.045	But I preferred, actually,
69.045	the reaction of a schoolchild
72.226	when I presented
72.226	at a school this information,
75.345	who raised their hand and said,
76.9	"""How do we know that the person"
76.9	who made that number
79.44	"isn't one of the 49 percent either?"""
81.279	(Laughter)
82.557	So clearly, there's a numeracy issue,
86.631	because these are
86.631	important skills for life,
88.765	and a lot of the changes
88.765	that we want to introduce in this century
92.656	involve us becoming
92.656	more comfortable with numbers.
95.121	Now, it's not just an English problem.
96.993	OECD this year released some figures
96.993	looking at numeracy in young people,
101.947	and leading the way, the USA --
104.751	nearly 40 percent of young people
104.751	in the US have low numeracy.
109.445	Now, England is there too,
110.766	but there are seven OECD countries
110.766	with figures above 20 percent.
116.323	That is a problem,
116.323	because it doesn't have to be that way.
119.106	If you look at the far end of this graph,
121.138	you can see the Netherlands and Korea
121.138	are in single figures.
124.122	So there's definitely a numeracy
124.122	problem that we want to address.
129.33	Now, as useful as studies like these are,
132.284	I think we risk herding people
132.284	inadvertently into one of two categories;
137.708	that there are two kinds of people:
139.508	those people that are comfortable
139.508	with numbers, that can do numbers,
143.881	and the people who can't.
146.141	And what I'm trying
146.141	to talk about here today
148.266	is to say that I believe
148.266	that is a false dichotomy.
151.332	It's not an immutable pairing.
153.224	I think you don't have to have
153.224	tremendously high levels of numeracy
156.896	to be inspired by numbers,
158.648	and that should be the starting point
158.648	to the journey ahead.
162.207	And one of the ways in which
162.207	we can begin that journey, for me,
166.542	is looking at statistics.
168.292	Now, I am the first to acknowledge
168.292	that statistics has got somewhat
171.811	of an image problem.
173.153	(Laughter)
174.224	It's the part of mathematics
175.78	that even mathematicians
175.78	don't particularly like,
178.863	because whereas the rest of maths
178.863	is all about precision and certainty,
182.899	statistics is almost the reverse of that.
185.613	But actually, I was a late convert
185.613	to the world of statistics myself.
190.292	If you'd asked my undergraduate professors
192.398	what two subjects would I be least likely
192.398	to excel in after university,
197.181	they'd have told you statistics
197.181	and computer programming,
199.972	and yet here I am, about to show you
199.972	some statistical graphics
202.935	that I programmed.
204.565	So what inspired that change in me?
206.344	What made me think that statistics
206.344	was actually an interesting thing?
210.016	It's really because
210.016	statistics are about us.
212.689	If you look at the etymology
212.689	of the word statistics,
215.295	it's the science of dealing with data
217.928	about the state or the community
217.928	that we live in.
220.382	So statistics are about us as a group,
223.76	not us as individuals.
225.459	And I think as social animals,
226.953	we share this fascination about how
226.953	we as individuals relate to our groups,
230.921	to our peers.
232.333	And statistics in this way
232.333	are at their most powerful
235.467	when they surprise us.
237.297	And there's been some really wonderful
237.297	surveys carried out recently
240.528	by Ipsos MORI in the last few years.
242.266	They did a survey of over
242.266	1,000 adults in the UK,
244.998	and said, for every 100 people
244.998	in England and Wales,
248.802	how many of them are Muslim?
250.696	Now the average answer from this survey,
253.366	which was supposed to be representative
253.366	of the total population, was 24.
256.802	That's what people thought.
260.502	British people think 24 out of every 100
260.502	people in the country are Muslim.
264.165	Now, official figures reveal
264.165	that figure to be about five.
269.552	So there's this big variation
269.552	between what we think, our perception,
273.563	and the reality as given by statistics.
275.625	And I think that's interesting.
277.193	What could possibly be causing
277.193	that misperception?
281.032	And I was so thrilled with this study,
282.91	I started to take questions out
282.91	in presentations. I was referring to it.
286.414	Now, I did a presentation
287.656	at St. Paul's School for Girls
287.656	in Hammersmith,
289.99	and I had an audience rather like this,
292.154	except it was comprised entirely
292.154	of sixth-form girls.
296.046	"And I said, ""Girls,"
299.418	how many teenage girls do you think
299.418	the British public think
303.985	"get pregnant every year?"""
305.757	And the girls were apoplectic when I said
309.273	the British public think that 15
309.273	out of every 100 teenage girls
313.21	get pregnant in the year.
315.249	And they had every right to be angry,
317.504	because in fact, I'd have to have
317.504	closer to 200 dots
320.286	before I could color one in,
321.88	in terms of what
321.88	the official figures tell us.
324.419	And rather like numeracy,
324.419	this is not just an English problem.
328.243	Ipsos MORI expanded the survey
328.243	in recent years to go across the world.
332.771	And so, they asked Saudi Arabians,
335.745	for every 100 adults in your country,
338.29	how many of them are overweight or obese?
342.346	And the average answer from the Saudis
342.346	was just over a quarter.
348.222	That's what they thought.
349.448	Just over a quarter of adults
349.448	are overweight or obese.
352.04	The official figures show, actually,
352.04	it's nearer to three-quarters.
356.845	(Laughter)
358.325	So again, a big variation.
360.641	And I love this one: they asked in Japan,
360.641	they asked the Japanese,
365.111	for every 100 Japanese people,
367.095	how many of them live in rural areas?
370.341	The average was about a 50-50 split,
370.341	just over halfway.
375.266	They thought 56 out of every 100
375.266	Japanese people lived in rural areas.
379.437	The official figure is seven.
382.079	So extraordinary variations,
382.079	and surprising to some,
386.553	but not surprising to people
386.553	who have read the work
388.966	of Daniel Kahneman, for example,
388.966	the Nobel-winning economist.
393.382	He and his colleague, Amos Tversky,
393.382	spent years researching this disjoint
398.498	between what people perceive
398.498	and the reality,
401.667	the fact that people are actually
401.667	pretty poor intuitive statisticians.
405.442	And there are many reasons for this.
407.226	Individual experiences, certainly,
407.226	can influence our perceptions,
410.365	but so, too, can things like the media
410.365	reporting things by exception,
414.347	rather than what's normal.
416.675	Kahneman had a nice way
416.675	of referring to that.
418.825	"He said, ""We can be blind"
418.825	"to the obvious"" --"
420.934	so we've got the numbers wrong --
422.596	"""but we can be blind"
422.596	"to our blindness about it."""
424.942	And that has enormous
424.942	repercussions for decision making.
428.232	So at the statistics office
428.232	while this was all going on,
431.108	I thought this was really interesting.
433.044	I said, this is clearly a global problem,
435.078	but maybe geography is the issue here.
437.537	These were questions that were all about,
437.537	how well do you know your country?
441.47	So in this case, it's how well
441.47	do you know 64 million people?
445.487	Not very well, it turns out.
445.487	I can't do that.
448.243	So I had an idea,
449.591	which was to think about
449.591	this same sort of approach
452.738	but to think about it
452.738	in a very local sense.
454.867	Is this a local?
456.082	If we reframe the questions and say,
458.047	how well do you know your local area,
460.193	would your answers be any more accurate?
463.637	So I devised a quiz:
465.423	How well do you know your area?
468.274	It's a simple Web app.
470.187	You put in a post code
471.394	and then it will ask you questions
471.394	based on census data
474.125	for your local area.
476.125	And I was very conscious
476.125	in designing this.
478.272	I wanted to make it open
478.272	to the widest possible range of people,
482.405	not just the 49 percent
482.405	who can get the numbers.
485.257	I wanted everyone to engage with it.
487.036	So for the design of the quiz,
488.585	I was inspired by the isotypes
492.224	of Otto Neurath from the 1920s and '30s.
494.85	Now, these are methods
494.85	for representing numbers
499.222	using repeating icons.
501.46	And the numbers are there,
501.46	but they sit in the background.
504.649	So it's a great way
504.649	of representing quantity
507.396	without resorting to using terms
507.396	"like ""percentage,"""
510.404	"""fractions"" and ""ratios."""
511.658	So here's the quiz.
514.13	The layout of the quiz is,
515.801	you have your repeating icons
515.801	on the left-hand side there,
518.644	and a map showing you the area
518.644	we're asking you questions about
521.791	on the right-hand side.
522.982	There are seven questions.
524.287	Each question, there's a possible answer
524.287	between zero and a hundred,
528.204	and at the end of the quiz,
529.577	you get an overall score
529.577	between zero and a hundred.
532.819	And so because this is TEDxExeter,
534.927	I thought we would have
534.927	a quick look at the quiz
537.276	for the first few questions of Exeter.
539.609	And so the first question is:
541.038	For every 100 people,
541.038	how many are aged under 16?
544.604	Now, I don't know Exeter very well
544.604	at all, so I had a guess at this,
548.228	but it gives you an idea
548.228	of how this quiz works.
550.813	You drag the slider
550.813	to highlight your icons,
554.543	"and then just click ""Submit"" to answer,"
556.802	and we animate away the difference
556.802	between your answer and reality.
560.489	And it turns out, I was a pretty
560.489	terrible guess: five.
564.969	How about the next question?
566.417	This is asking about
566.417	what the average age is,
568.597	so the age at which half
568.597	the population are younger
571.066	and half the population are older.
572.764	And I thought 35 -- that sounds
572.764	middle-aged to me.
576.138	(Laughter)
580.026	Actually, in Exeter,
580.026	it's incredibly young,
582.156	and I had underestimated the impact
582.156	of the university in this area.
586.718	The questions get harder
586.718	as you go through.
588.773	So this one's now asking
588.773	about homeownership:
591.775	For every 100 households, how many
591.775	are owned with a mortgage or loan?
595.498	And I hedged my bets here,
596.802	because I didn't want to be
596.802	more than 50 out on the answer.
599.924	(Laughter)
601.968	And actually, these get harder,
601.968	these questions,
604.458	because when you're in an area,
604.458	when you're in a community,
607.341	things like age -- there are clues
607.341	to whether a population is old or young.
612.615	Just by looking around
612.615	the area, you can see it.
614.984	Something like homeownership
614.984	is much more difficult to see,
618.399	so we revert to our own heuristics,
621.031	our own biases about how many people
621.031	we think own their own homes.
625.506	Now the truth is,
625.506	when we published this quiz,
629.18	the census data that it's based on
629.18	was already a few years old.
632.74	We've had online applications
632.74	that allow you to put in a post code
636.333	and get statistics back for years.
638.451	So in some senses,
639.664	this was all a little bit old
639.664	and not necessarily new.
643.237	But I was interested to see
643.237	what reaction we might get
646.9	by gamifying the data
646.9	in the way that we have,
649.641	by using animation
651.072	and playing on the fact
651.072	that people have their own preconceptions.
655.328	It turns out, the reaction was, um ...
660.148	was more than I could have hoped for.
662.1	It was a long-held ambition of mine
662.1	to bring down a statistics website
665.505	due to public demand.
666.937	(Laughter)
668.761	This URL contains the words
668.761	"""statistics,"" ""gov"" and ""UK,"""
672.249	which are three of people's least
672.249	favorite words in a URL.
675.515	And the amazing thing about this
675.515	was that the website came down
679.524	at quarter to 10 at night,
681.641	because people were actually
681.641	engaging with this data
684.876	of their own free will,
686.439	using their own personal time.
688.498	I was very interested to see
691.009	that we got something like
691.009	a quarter of a million people
694.746	playing the quiz within the space
694.746	of 48 hours of launching it.
698.042	And it sparked an enormous discussion
698.042	online, on social media,
701.993	which was largely dominated
704.054	by people having fun
704.054	with their misconceptions,
708.071	which is something that
708.071	I couldn't have hoped for any better,
711.154	in some respects.
712.338	I also liked the fact that people started
712.338	sending it to politicians.
715.588	How well do you know the area
715.588	you claim to represent?
718.201	(Laughter)
719.387	And then just to finish,
721.812	going back to the two kinds of people,
724.166	I thought it would be
724.166	really interesting to see
726.447	how people who are good with numbers
726.447	would do on this quiz.
729.286	The national statistician
729.286	of England and Wales, John Pullinger,
732.326	you would expect he would be pretty good.
735.344	He got 44 for his own area.
737.817	(Laughter)
740.309	Jeremy Paxman -- admittedly,
740.309	after a glass of wine -- 36.
745.871	Even worse.
747.356	It just shows you that the numbers
747.356	can inspire us all.
750.581	They can surprise us all.
751.865	So very often, we talk about statistics
753.928	as being the science of uncertainty.
755.914	My parting thought for today is:
757.72	actually, statistics is the science of us.
760.779	And that's why we should
760.779	be fascinated by numbers.
763.591	Thank you very much.
764.805	(Applause)
