16.753	"""Ashley Judd, stupid fucking slut."
21.54	"""You can't sue someone"
21.54	"for calling them a cunt."""
24.74	"""If you can't handle the Internet,"
24.74	"fuck off, whore."""
28.94	"""I wish Ashley Judd"
28.94	would die a horrible death.
31.54	"She is the absolute worst."""
33.94	"""Ashley Judd, you're the reason"
33.94	"women shouldn't vote."""
37.86	"""'Twisted' is such a bad movie,"
40.42	"I don't even want to rape it."""
44.34	"""Whatever you do,"
45.58	don't tell Ashley Judd.
45.58	"She'll die alone with a dried out vagina."""
50.38	"""If I had to fuck an older woman,"
52.78	oh my God,
54.06	I would fuck the shit out of Ashley Judd,
56.26	that bitch is hot af.
59.54	"The unforgivable shit I would do to her."""
64.3	Online misogyny is a global
64.3	gender rights tragedy,
70.98	and it is imperative that it ends.
73.9	(Applause)
82.5	Girls' and women's voices,
84.26	and our allies' voices
84.26	are constrained in ways
88.1	that are personally, economically,
90.14	professionally and politically damaging.
92.78	And when we curb abuse,
95.46	we will expand freedom.
99.14	I am a Kentucky basketball fan,
100.86	so on a fine March day last year,
102.94	I was doing one of the things I do best:
105.54	I was cheering for my Wildcats.
107.5	The daffodils were blooming,
108.9	but the referees were not blowing
108.9	the whistle when I was telling them to.
112.38	(Laughter)
113.66	Funny, they're very friendly
113.66	to me before the opening tip,
116.42	but they really ignore me during the game.
118.5	(Laughter)
119.54	Three of my players were bleeding,
119.54	so I did the next best thing ...
123.02	I tweeted.
124.26	[@ArkRazorback dirty play can kiss
124.26	my team's free throw making a --
127.46	@KySportsRadio @marchmadness
127.46	@espn Bloodied 3 players so far.]
130.42	It is routine for me to be treated
130.42	in the ways I've already described to you.
134.1	It happens to me every single day
135.74	on social media platforms
135.74	such as Twitter and Facebook.
138.38	Since I joined Twitter in 2011,
140.78	misogyny and misogynists
140.78	have amply demonstrated
144.82	they will dog my every step.
146.82	My spirituality, my faith,
149.22	being a hillbilly --
149.22	I can say that, you can't --
151.53	all of it is fair game.
154.74	And I have responded to this
154.74	with various strategies.
157.9	I've tried engaging people.
159.26	This one guy was sending me
159.26	hypersexual, nasty stuff,
163.9	and there was a girl in his avatar.
166.58	I wrote him back and said ...
169.54	"""Is that your daughter?"
171.82	I feel a lot of fear
171.82	that you may think about
174.06	"and talk to women this way."""
175.74	And he surprised me by saying,
177.22	"""You know what?"
177.22	"You're right. I apologize."""
179.66	Sometimes people
179.66	want to be held accountable.
183.18	This one guy was musing
183.18	to I don't know who
185.9	that maybe I was the definition of a cunt.
188.78	I was married to a Scot for 14 years,
190.62	"so I said, ""Cunt means many"
190.62	different things in different countries --
194.22	(Laughter)
195.46	but I'm pretty sure you epitomize
195.46	"the global standard of a dick."""
198.58	(Laughter)
199.82	(Applause)
204.34	I've tried to rise above it,
204.34	I've tried to get in the trenches,
207.34	but mostly I would scroll through
207.34	these social media platforms
210.3	with one eye partially closed,
210.3	trying not to see it,
212.94	but you can't make
212.94	a cucumber out of a pickle.
216.1	What is seen goes in.
217.58	It's traumatic.
219.22	And I was always secretly hoping
219.22	in some part of me
221.94	that what was being said to me
221.94	and about me wasn't ...
226.06	true.
228.86	Because even I,
230.98	an avowed, self-declared feminist,
235.06	who worships at the altar of Gloria --
237.82	(Laughter)
240.26	internalize the patriarchy.
242.82	This is really critical.
244.38	Patriarchy is not boys and men.
247.18	It is a system
247.18	in which we all participate,
249.94	including me.
254.3	On that particular day, for some reason,
256.26	that particular tweet
256.26	after the basketball game
258.82	"triggered something called a ""cyber mob."""
261.42	This vitriolic, global outpouring
261.42	of the most heinous hate speech:
267.46	death threats, rape threats.
269.42	And don't you know,
270.659	when I was sitting at home
270.659	alone in my nightgown,
273.02	I got a phone call,
273.02	and it was my beloved former husband,
275.74	and he said on a voice mail,
277.1	"""Loved one ..."
279.62	"what is happening to you is not OK."""
282.94	And there was something about him
282.94	taking a stand for me that night ...
290.46	that allowed me
290.46	to take a stand for myself.
292.54	And I started to write.
294.46	I started to write about sharing the fact
297.22	that I'm a survivor
297.22	of all forms of sexual abuse,
299.58	including three rapes.
301.02	And the hate speech
301.02	I get in response to that --
303.3	these are just some of the comments
303.3	posted to news outlets.
308.74	"Being told I'm a ""snitch"" is really fun."
312.82	[Jay: She enjoyed every second of it!!!!!]
314.9	Audience: Oh, Lord Jesus.
316.14	Ashley Judd: Thank you, Jesus.
316.14	May your grace and mercy shine.
319.98	So, I wrote this feminist op-ed,
319.98	it is entitled,
324.3	"""Forget Your Team:"
326.1	It Is Your Online Gender Violence
326.1	Toward Girls And Women
328.94	"That Can Kiss My Righteous Ass."""
331.46	(Laughter)
333.02	(Applause)
336.285	And I did that alone,
336.285	and I published it alone,
338.5	because my chief advisor said,
339.98	"""Please don't,"
341.22	the rain of retaliatory garbage
341.22	that is inevitable --
344.02	"I fear for you."""
345.46	But I trust girls and I trust women,
347.58	and I trust our allies.
349.18	It was published, it went viral,
350.86	it proves that every single day
352.98	online misogyny is a phenomenon
352.98	endured by us all,
356.5	all over the world,
357.74	and when it is intersectional,
359.5	it is worse.
360.74	Sexual orientation, gender identity,
362.7	race, ethnicity, religion --
364.54	you name it,
365.78	it amplifies the violence
365.78	endured by girls and women,
368.34	and for our younger girls, it is worse.
372.9	It's clearly traumatizing.
374.66	Our mental health,
374.66	our emotional well-being
377.86	are so gravely affected
379.34	because the threat of violence
380.82	is experienced
380.82	neurobiologically as violence.
385.06	The cortisol shoots up,
385.06	the limbic system gets fired,
388.14	we lose productivity at work.
391.74	And let's talk about work.
393.5	Our ability to work is constrained.
397.02	Online searches of women applying for jobs
397.02	reveal nude pictures of them,
401.74	false allegations they have STDs,
404.58	their addresses indicating
404.58	that they are available for sex
409.82	with real examples
411.38	of people showing up
411.38	at this house for said sex.
415.9	Our ability to go to school is impaired.
423.38	of sexual images of our young people ...
427.38	girls.
428.86	Our girls.
430.5	Our boys are two to three
430.5	times more likely --
434.38	nonconsensually --
436.38	to share images.
439.42	And I want to say a word
439.42	about revenge porn.
442.22	Part of what came out of this tweet
444.5	was my getting connected
444.5	with allies and other activists
447.34	who are fighting
447.34	for a safe and free internet.
450.7	We started something
450.7	called the Speech Project;
453.26	curbing abuse, expanding freedom.
455.78	And that website
455.78	provides a critical forum,
459.1	because there is no global, legal thing
463.66	to help us figure this out.
465.18	But we do provide on that website
465.18	a standardized list of definitions,
468.82	because it's hard to attack
468.82	a behavior in the right way
471.94	if we're not all sharing
471.94	a definition of what that behavior is.
475.38	And I learned that revenge porn
475.38	is often dangerously misapplied.
480.18	It is the nonconsensual
480.18	sharing of an image
483.5	used tactically to shame
483.5	and humiliate a girl or woman
487.98	that attempts to pornography us.
490.62	Our natural sexuality is --
494.5	I don't know about yours --
494.5	pretty gorgeous and wonderful.
498.9	And my expressing it
498.9	does not pornography make.
502.18	(Applause)
508.06	So, I have all these resources
509.54	that I'm keenly aware
509.54	so many people in the world do not.
513.5	I was able to start
513.5	the Speech Project with colleagues.
517.14	I can often get a social media
517.14	company's attention.
519.66	I have a wonderful visit
519.66	to Facebook HQ coming up.
525.54	Hasn't helped the idiotic
525.54	reporting standards yet ...
530.7	I actually pay someone
530.7	to scrub my social media feeds,
536.62	attempting to spare my brain
538.78	the daily iterations
538.78	of the trauma of hate speech.
543.02	And guess what?
544.26	I get hate speech for that.
545.66	"""Oh, you live in an echo chamber."""
547.304	Well, guess what?
548.58	Having someone post a photograph
548.58	of me with my mouth open
551.3	"saying they ""can't wait"
551.3	"to cum on my face,"""
553.38	I have a right to set that boundary.
555.66	(Applause)
561.46	And this distinction
561.46	between virtual and real is specious
564.58	because guess what --
565.82	that actually happened to me
565.82	once when I was a child,
568.34	and so that tweet brought up that trauma,
570.94	and I had to do work on that.
572.74	But you know what we do?
572.74	We take all of this hate speech,
575.94	and we disaggregate it,
578.66	and we code it,
580.06	and we give that data
581.94	so that we understand
581.94	the intersectionality of it:
584.66	when I get porn,
585.94	when it's about political affiliation,
587.82	when it's about age,
587.82	when it's about all of it.
590.86	We're going to win this fight.
594.58	There are a lot of solutions --
597.54	thank goodness.
599.18	I'm going to offer just a few,
601.34	and of course I challenge you
601.34	to create and contribute your own.
607.18	Number one: we have to start
607.18	with digital media literacy,
610.46	and clearly it must have a gendered lens.
614.02	Kids, schools, caregivers, parents:
616.54	it's essential.
618.22	Two ...
620.46	shall we talk about our friends in tech?
623.46	Said with dignity and respect,
626.1	the sexism in your workplaces must end.
631.1	(Applause)
633.58	(Cheers)
635.58	EDGE,
636.82	the global standard for gender equality,
639.7	is the minimum standard.
641.26	And guess what, Silicon Valley?
643.5	If L'Oréal in India,
645.5	in the Philippines, in Brazil
647.7	and in Russia can do it,
649.62	you can, too.
652.34	Enough excuses.
655.02	Only when women have critical mass
655.02	in every department at your companies,
658.82	including building platforms
658.82	from the ground up,
661.66	will the conversations
661.66	about priorities and solutions change.
666.02	And more love for my friends in tech:
668.1	profiteering off misogyny
668.1	in video games must end.
672.62	I'm so tired of hearing you
672.62	talk to me at cocktail parties --
676.1	like you did a couple
676.1	weeks ago in Aspen --
678.46	about how deplorable #Gamergate was,
681.42	when you're still making
681.42	billions of dollars off games
684.06	that maim and dump women for sport.
687.3	Basta! -- as the Italians would say.
689.86	Enough.
691.14	(Applause)
695.06	Our friends in law enforcement
695.06	have much to do,
698.58	because we've seen
700.22	that online violence
700.22	is an extension of in-person violence.
706.06	In our country,
707.82	more girls and women have been
707.82	murdered by their intimate partners
712.62	than died on 9/11
714.42	and have died since
714.42	in Afghanistan and Iraq combined.
719.06	And it's not cool to say that,
721.18	but it is true.
723.18	We care so much geopolitically
723.18	about what men are doing over there
727.1	to women over there ...
729.3	In 2015,
	partner violence services in this country.
737.94	That is not counting the girls
737.94	and women and boys who needed them.
742.98	Law enforcement must be empowered
746.1	with up-to-date internet technology,
748.34	the devices and an understanding
748.34	of these platforms --
751.58	how they work.
753.3	The police wanted to be helpful
753.3	when Amanda Hess called
756.06	about the death threat
756.06	she was getting on Twitter,
758.62	but they couldn't really when they said,
760.78	"""What's Twitter?"""
764.46	Our legislators must write
764.46	and pass astute legislation
768.38	that reflects today's technology
770.3	and our notions of free and hate speech.
774.1	In New York recently, the law
774.1	could not be applied to a perpetrator
778.66	because the crimes
778.66	must have been committed --
780.86	even if it was anonymous --
782.22	they must have been committed
782.22	by telephone, in mail,
786.7	by telegraph --
788.14	(Laughter)
792.82	The language must be
792.82	technologically neutral.
797.18	So apparently,
799.02	I've got a pretty bold voice.
801.34	So, let's talk about our friends ...
803.9	white men.
806.98	You have a role to play
806.98	and a choice to make.
810.46	You can do something,
812.62	or you can do nothing.
816.1	We're cool in this room,
817.38	but when this goes out, everyone will say,
819.404	"""Oh my God, she's a reverse racist."""
822.34	That quote was said
822.34	by a white man, Robert Moritz,
825.94	chairperson, PricewaterhouseCoopers,
828.38	he asked me to include it in my talk.
832.78	We need to grow support lines
832.78	and help groups,
836.3	so victims can help each other
839.06	when their lives and finances
839.06	have been derailed.
841.9	We must as individuals disrupt
841.9	gender violence as it is happening.
853.9	We must have the courage and urgency
855.66	to practice stopping it
855.66	as it is unfolding.
860.06	And lastly,
862.54	believe her.
865.42	Believe her.
866.66	(Applause)
873.54	This is fundamentally
873.54	a problem of human interaction.
878.38	And as I believe that human interaction
878.38	is at the core of our healing,
882.54	trauma not transformed
882.54	will be trauma transferred.
887.42	Edith Wharton said,
887.42	"""The end is latent in the beginning,"""
890.54	so we are going to end this talk
890.54	replacing hate speech with love speech.
895.54	Because I get lonely in this,
897.5	but I know that we are allies.
900.46	I recently learned
902.14	about how gratitude and affirmations
902.14	offset negative interactions.
906.78	It takes five of those
906.78	to offset one negative interaction,
910.26	and gratitude in particular --
911.74	free, available globally
911.74	any time, anywhere,
914.46	to anyone in any dialect --
916.58	it fires the pregenual anterior cingulate,
919.82	a watershed part of the brain
921.66	that floods it with great, good stuff.
924.3	So I'm going to say
924.3	awesome stuff about myself.
926.94	I would like for you
926.94	to reflect it back to me.
929.3	It might sound something like this --
931.46	(Laughter)
932.94	I am a powerful and strong woman,
932.94	"and you would say, ""Yes, you are."""
936.98	Audience: Yes, you are.
938.66	Ashley Judd: My mama loves me.
940.42	A: Yes, she does.
941.86	AJ: I did a great job with my talk.
943.94	A: Yes, you did.
945.58	AJ: I have a right to be here.
948.74	A: Yes, you do.
950.54	AJ: I'm really cute.
951.78	(Laughter)
953.06	A: Yes, you are.
954.54	AJ: God does good work.
956.3	A: Yes, He does.
958.1	AJ: And I love you.
959.86	Thank you so much
959.86	for letting me be of service.
963.14	Bless you.
964.38	(Applause)
