12.84	Good evening.
14.6	My journey to this stage
16.6	began when I came to America
18.24	at the age of 17.
21.24	You see, I'm one
21.24	of the 84 million Americans
24.68	who are immigrants
26	or children of immigrants.
28.44	Each of us has a dream when we come here,
32.28	a dream that usually has to be rewritten
35.32	and always has to be repurposed.
38.56	I was one of the lucky ones.
40.48	My revised dream
40.48	led me to the work I do today:
44.32	training immigrants
44.32	to run for public office
47.28	and leading a movement
47.28	for inclusive democracy.
51.08	But I don't want you to think
51.08	it was a cakewalk,
53.48	that America opened its arms wide
53.48	and welcomed me.
57.36	It's still not doing that.
60.12	And I've learned
60.12	a few lessons along the way
62.28	that I wanted to share with you,
63.92	because I think that together
65.92	we can make American democracy
68.64	better and stronger.
71.4	I was born in India,
73	the world's largest democracy,
76	and when I was four,
77.28	my family moved to Belize,
79.12	the world's smallest democracy perhaps.
83.4	And at the age of 17,
85.16	I moved to the United States,
87.04	the world's greatest democracy.
90.48	I came because I wanted
90.48	to study English literature.
94.04	You see, as a child,
94.04	I buried my nose in books,
96.96	and I thought, why not make a living
96.96	doing that as an adult?
100.64	But after I graduated from college
103.12	and got a graduate degree,
105.28	I found myself moving
105.28	from one less ideal job to another.
111.68	Maybe it was the optimism
111.68	that I had about America
115.04	that made me take a while to understand
117.96	that things were not going to change.
120.24	The door that I thought was open
123.16	was actually just slightly ajar --
126.08	this door of America
128.04	that would open wide
128.04	if you had the right name,
131.16	the right skin color,
132.8	the right networks,
134.68	but could just slam in your face
137.44	if you had the wrong religion,
139.56	the wrong immigration status,
142.199	the wrong skin color.
145.84	And I just couldn't accept that.
148.48	So I started a career
148.48	as a social entrepreneur,
152.24	starting an organization
152.24	for young people like myself --
155.52	I was young at the time
155.52	that I started it --
158.56	who traced their heritage
158.56	to the Indian subcontinent.
162.48	In that work, I became and advocate
162.48	for South Asians and other immigrants.
167.44	I lobbied members of Congress
167.44	on policy issues.
171.48	I volunteered on election day
171.48	to do exit polling.
176	But I couldn't vote,
176	and I couldn't run for office.
181	So in 2000, when it was announced
183.84	that the citizenship application fee
183.84	was going to more than double
187.68	from 95 dollars to 225 dollars,
191.4	I decided it was time to apply
191.4	before I could no longer afford it.
196.68	I filled out a long application,
198.56	answering questions about
198.56	my current and my past affiliations.
203.88	And once the application was submitted,
206.6	there were fingerprints to be taken,
208.88	a test to study for,
211.08	endless hours of waiting in line.
214.6	You might call it extreme vetting.
218.08	And then in December of 2000,
221.04	I joined hundreds of other immigrants
224.04	in a hall in Brooklyn
226.2	where we pledged our loyalty
228.56	to a country that we had
228.56	long considered home.
232.24	My journey from international student
232.24	to American citizen took 16 years,
236.88	a short timeline when you compare it
236.88	to other immigrant stories.
241.88	And soon after I had taken
241.88	that formal step
245.2	to becoming an American,
247.16	the attacks of September 11, 2001,
250.04	changed the immigration landscape
250.04	for decades to come.
255.88	My city, New York City,
257.84	was reeling and healing,
260.24	and in the midst of it,
261.64	we were in an election cycle.
264.64	Two things happened
265.92	as we coped with loss and recovery
265.92	in New York City.
270.56	Voters elected Michael Bloomberg
270.56	mayor of New York City.
275.52	We also adopted by ballot referendum
279.8	the Office of Immigrant Affairs
279.8	for the City of New York.
283.52	Five months after that election,
286.36	the newly elected mayor
288.68	appointed me the first Commissioner
288.68	of Immigrant Affairs
292.92	for this newly established office.
296.48	I want you to come back to that time.
299.2	I was a young immigrant woman from Belize.
302.48	I had basically floundered
302.48	in various jobs in America
306.32	before I started
306.32	a community-based organization
309.88	in a church basement in Queens.
313.72	The attacks of September 11
313.72	sent shock waves through my community.
318.32	People who were members of my family,
318.32	young people I had worked with,
323.32	were experiencing harassment
325.16	at schools, at workplaces
325.16	and in airports.
329.32	And now I was going
329.32	to represent their concerns
333	in government.
335.56	No job felt more perfect for me.
339.64	And here are two things I learned
339.64	when I became Commissioner.
343.92	First, well-meaning New Yorkers
347.08	who were in city government
347.08	holding government positions
350.24	had no idea how scared immigrants were
354.72	of law enforcement.
356.64	Most of us don't really know
356.64	the difference, do we,
359.08	between a sheriff
359.08	and local police and the FBI.
363.4	And most of us,
363.4	when we see someone in uniform
365.92	going through our neighborhoods
367.84	feel curiosity, if not concern.
372.12	So if you're an undocumented parent,
375.04	every day when you say
375.04	goodbye to your child,
378.08	send them off to school and go to work,
380.84	you don't know what the chances are
382.84	that you're going to see them
382.84	at the end of the day.
385.44	Because a raid at your workplace,
388.56	a chance encounter with local police
391.16	could change the course
391.16	of your life forever.
395.48	The second thing I learned
395.48	is that when people like me,
398.24	who understood that fear,
401	who had learned a new language,
401	who had navigated new systems,
404.84	when people like us
404.84	were sitting at the table,
408.2	we advocated for our communities' needs
408.2	in a way that no one else could or would.
414.2	I understood what that feeling
414.2	of fear was like.
418.04	People in my family were experiencing it.
420.4	Young people I had worked with
420.4	were being harassed,
422.84	not just by classmates,
424.84	but also by their teachers.
427.52	My husband, then boyfriend,
429.36	thought twice before he put
429.36	a backpack on or grew a beard
433.6	because he traveled so much.
438.56	What I learned in 2001
438.56	was that my vote mattered
442.28	but that my voice
442.28	and vantage point also mattered.
446.68	And it's these three things --
448.36	immigrants' votes,
448.36	voices and vantage points --
451.52	that I think can help
451.52	make our democracy stronger.
456.04	We actually have the power
458.08	to change the outcome of elections,
461.08	to introduce new issues
461.08	into the policy debate
465.24	and to change the face
465.24	of the pale, male, stale leadership
470.16	that we have in our country today.
473.88	So how do we do that?
475.2	Well, let's talk first about votes.
477.8	It will come as no surprise to you
479.48	that the majority of voters
479.48	in America are white.
483.16	But it might surprise you to know
484.96	that one in three voters
484.96	are black, Latino or Asian.
489.84	But here's the thing:
491.4	it doesn't just matter who can vote,
491.4	it matters who does vote.
496.44	So in 2012, half of the Latino
496.44	and Asian-American voters
500.88	did not vote.
504.4	And these votes matter
504.4	not just in presidential elections.
507.72	They matter in local and state elections.
510.6	In 2015, Lan Diep,
513.48	the eldest son of political
513.48	refugees from Vietnam,
517.76	ran for a seat
517.76	in the San Jose City Council.
521.48	He lost that election by 13 votes.
525.88	This year, he dusted off
525.88	those campaign shoes
528.88	and went back to run for that seat,
532.76	and this time he won, by 12 votes.
538.12	Every one of our votes matters.
542.64	And when people like Lan
542.64	are sitting at the policy table,
545.84	they can make a difference.
547.2	We need those voices.
549	We need those voices
550.28	in part because American leadership
554.4	does not look like America's residents.
558.04	There are over 500,000
558.04	local and state offices in America.
562.96	Fewer than 2 percent of those offices
562.96	are held by Asian-Americans or Latinos,
568.16	the two largest immigrant groups
568.16	in our country.
572.6	In the city of Yakima, Washington,
574.96	where 49 percent
574.96	of the population is Latino,
578.6	there has never been a Latino
578.6	on the city council until this year.
583.88	Three newly elected Latinas
583.88	joined the Yakima City Council in 2016.
589.52	One of them is Carmen MÃ©ndez.
592.24	She is a first-generation college student.
595	She grew up partly in Colima, Mexico,
597.84	and partly in Yakima, Washington.
600.28	She's a single mother,
600.28	a community advocate.
603.36	Her voice on the Yakima City Council
606.04	is advocating on behalf
606.04	of the Latino community
608.64	and of all Yakima residents.
610.92	And she's a role model for her daughter
613.52	and other Latinas.
616.16	But the third most untapped resource
616.16	in American democracy
620.68	is the vantage point
620.68	that immigrants bring.
624.08	We have fought to be here.
626.92	We have come for economic
626.92	and educational opportunity.
630.44	We have come for political
630.44	and religious freedom.
633.8	We have come in the pursuit of love.
637.16	That dedication,
639.04	that commitment to America
641.88	we also bring to public service.
645.52	People like Athena Salman,
647.68	who just last week won the primary
652.2	for a seat in the Arizona State House.
655.6	Athena's father grew up in the West Bank
657.72	and moved to Chicago,
658.96	where he met her mother.
660.44	Her mother is part Italian,
662.52	part Mexican and part German.
664.96	Together they moved to Arizona
664.96	and built a life.
668.08	Athena, when she gets to the statehouse,
670.96	is going to fight for things
670.96	like education funding
673.52	that will help give
673.52	families like hers a leg up
677.08	so they can achieve
677.08	the financial stability
679.12	that we all are looking for.
682.92	Immigrants' votes,
682.92	voices and vantage points
686.4	are what we all need to work
686.4	to include in American democracy.
690.32	It's not just my work. It's also yours.
693.68	And it's not going to be easy.
695.52	We never know
697.2	what putting a new factor
697.2	into an equation will do.
701.44	And it's a little scary.
703.96	You're scared that I'm going
703.96	to take away your place at the table,
707.72	and I'm scared that I'm never
707.72	going to get a place at the table.
712.4	And we're all scared
713.64	that we're going to lose this country
713.64	that we know and love.
718.32	I'm scared you're going
718.32	to take it away from me,
720.72	and you're scared
720.72	I'm going to take it away from you.
727	Look, it's been a rough election year,
729.6	a reminder that people
729.6	with my immigration history
734	could be removed at the whim of a leader.
737.32	But I have fought to be in this country
740.76	and I continue to do so every day.
743.72	So my optimism never wavers,
746.84	because I know that there are
746.84	millions of immigrants just like me,
751.4	in front of me,
751.4	behind me and all around me.
755	It's our country, too.
757.92	Thank you.
759.16	(Applause)
