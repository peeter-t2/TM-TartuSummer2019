13	It's often said that you can tell
13	a lot about a person
15.927	by looking at what's on their bookshelves.
19.679	What do my bookshelves say about me?
22.402	Well, when I asked myself
22.402	this question a few years ago,
26.11	I made an alarming discovery.
29.131	I'd always thought of myself
29.131	as a fairly cultured,
32.159	cosmopolitan sort of person.
34.608	But my bookshelves told
34.608	a rather different story.
38.439	Pretty much all the titles on them
40.115	were by British or North American authors,
42.998	and there was almost
42.998	nothing in translation.
46.327	Discovering this massive,
46.327	cultural blind spot in my reading
50.201	came as quite a shock.
52.026	And when I thought about it,
52.026	it seemed like a real shame.
55.543	I knew there had to be lots
55.543	of amazing stories out there
58.939	by writers working in languages
58.939	other than English.
62.34	And it seemed really sad to think
62.34	that my reading habits meant
65.666	I would probably never encounter them.
68.435	So, I decided to prescribe myself
71.325	an intensive course of global reading.
	international year for the UK;
78.364	it was the year of the London Olympics.
80.46	And so I decided to use it
80.46	as my time frame
84.006	to try to read a novel,
84.006	short story collection
87.237	or memoir from every country in the world.
92.771	And so I did.
94.128	And it was very exciting
95.779	and I learned some remarkable things
97.699	and made some wonderful connections
99.838	that I want to share with you today.
102.088	But it started with some
102.088	practical problems.
105.849	After I'd worked out which of the many
105.849	different lists of countries in the world
110.54	to use for my project,
112.77	I ended up going with the list
112.77	of UN-recognized nations,
115.944	to which I added Taiwan,
117.191	which gave me a total of 196 countries.
121.143	And after I'd worked out
121.143	how to fit reading and blogging
124.022	about, roughly, four books a week
126.356	around working five days a week,
129.491	I then had to face up to the fact
129.491	that I might even not be able
133.219	to get books in English
133.219	from every country.
136.546	Only around 4.5 percent
136.546	of the literary works published
140.315	each year in the UK are translations,
142.99	and the figures are similar for much
142.99	of the English-speaking world.
146.64	Although, the proportion
146.64	of translated books published
149.617	in many other countries is a lot higher.
153.101	4.5 percent is tiny enough to start with,
156.433	but what that figure doesn't tell you
158.292	is that many of those books
158.292	will come from countries
160.989	with strong publishing networks
163.187	and lots of industry professionals
163.187	primed to go out and sell those titles
167.378	to English-language publishers.
169.711	So, for example, although well over 100
169.711	books are translated from French
174.307	and published in the UK each year,
176.234	most of them will come from countries
176.234	like France or Switzerland.
181.107	French-speaking Africa, on the other hand,
183.869	will rarely ever get a look-in.
186.284	The upshot is that there are
186.284	actually quite a lot of nations
189.631	that may have little or even no
189.631	commercially available literature
193.286	in English.
195.074	Their books remain invisible to readers
198.164	of the world's most published language.
202.002	But when it came to reading the world,
203.844	the biggest challenge of all for me
205.638	was that fact that I didn't
205.638	know where to start.
209.201	Having spent my life reading
209.201	almost exclusively British
212.583	and North American books,
214.256	I had no idea how to go about
214.256	sourcing and finding stories
217.869	and choosing them from much
217.869	of the rest of the world.
220.604	I couldn't tell you how to source
220.604	a story from Swaziland.
224.013	I wouldn't know a good novel from Namibia.
227.125	There was no hiding it --
228.742	I was a clueless literary xenophobe.
232.541	So how on earth was I
232.541	going to read the world?
235.777	I was going to have to ask for help.
237.658	So in October 2011, I registered my blog,
241.181	ayearofreadingtheworld.com,
242.976	and I posted a short appeal online.
245.863	I explained who I was,
247.116	how narrow my reading had been,
249.148	and I asked anyone who cared to
251.029	to leave a message suggesting
251.029	what I might read
253.618	from other parts of the planet.
255.913	Now, I had no idea whether
255.913	anyone would be interested,
260.01	but within a few hours
260.01	of me posting that appeal online,
263.148	people started to get in touch.
265.608	At first, it was friends and colleagues.
268.466	Then it was friends of friends.
270.383	And pretty soon, it was strangers.
273.399	Four days after I put that appeal online,
276.225	I got a message from a woman
276.225	called Rafidah in Kuala Lumpur.
280.292	She said she loved
280.292	the sound of my project,
282.991	could she go to her local
282.991	English-language bookshop
285.914	and choose my Malaysian book
285.914	and post it to me?
289.912	I accepted enthusiastically,
291.689	and a few weeks later,
293.215	a package arrived containing
293.215	not one, but two books --
299.263	Rafidah's choice from Malaysia,
302.908	and a book from Singapore
302.908	that she had also picked out for me.
308.428	Now, at the time, I was amazed
310.889	that a stranger more than 6,000 miles away
314.489	would go to such lengths to help someone
316.438	she would probably never meet.
319.1	But Rafidah's kindness proved
319.1	to be the pattern for that year.
323.24	Time and again, people went
323.24	out of their way to help me.
327.226	Some took on research on my behalf,
329.859	and others made detours
329.859	on holidays and business trips
332.906	to go to bookshops for me.
335.526	It turns out, if you want
335.526	to read the world,
338.786	if you want to encounter it
338.786	with an open mind,
342.211	the world will help you.
345.118	When it came to countries
346.357	with little or no commercially
346.357	available literature in English,
349.887	people went further still.
352.689	Books often came from surprising sources.
356.536	My Panamanian read, for example,
356.536	came through a conversation
359.599	I had with the Panama Canal on Twitter.
363.497	Yes, the Panama Canal
363.497	has a Twitter account.
367.731	And when I tweeted at it about my project,
370.129	it suggested that I might like to try
370.129	and get hold of the work
373.532	of the Panamanian author
373.532	Juan David Morgan.
376.898	I found Morgan's website
376.898	and I sent him a message,
379.492	asking if any of his
379.492	Spanish-language novels
381.948	had been translated into English.
384.432	And he said that nothing
384.432	had been published,
386.887	but he did have an unpublished translation
389.341	"of his novel ""The Golden Horse."""
391.887	He emailed this to me,
393.249	allowing me to become
393.249	one of the first people ever
396.407	to read that book in English.
398.929	Morgan was by no means the only wordsmith
401.603	to share his work with me in this way.
404.015	From Sweden to Palau,
405.801	writers and translators
405.801	sent me self-published books
409.816	and unpublished manuscripts of books
411.57	that hadn't been picked
411.57	up by Anglophone publishers
414.474	or that were no longer available,
416.52	giving me privileged glimpses
416.52	of some remarkable imaginary worlds.
422.008	I read, for example,
423.183	about the Southern African king
423.183	Ngungunhane, who led the resistance
427.797	against the Portuguese
427.797	in the 19th century;
431.113	and about marriage rituals
431.113	in a remote village
433.908	on the shores of the Caspian sea
433.908	in Turkmenistan.
438.524	I met Kuwait's answer to Bridget Jones.
442.45	(Laughter)
445.301	And I read about an orgy
445.301	in a tree in Angola.
452.87	But perhaps the most amazing example
455.046	of the lengths that people
455.046	were prepared to go to
457.474	to help me read the world,
459.125	came towards the end of my quest,
461.598	when I tried to get hold of a book
461.598	from the tiny, Portuguese-speaking
465.456	African island nation
465.456	of São Tomé and Príncipe.
469.364	Now, having spent several months
469.364	trying everything I could think of to find
473.037	a book that had been translated
473.037	into English from the nation,
476.4	it seemed as though
476.4	the only option left to me
478.666	was to see if I could get something
478.666	translated for me from scratch.
482.404	Now, I was really dubious
483.929	whether anyone was going
483.929	to want to help with this,
486.349	and give up their time
486.349	for something like that.
489.525	But, within a week of me putting
489.525	a call out on Twitter and Facebook
493.812	for Portuguese speakers,
495.79	I had more people than I could
495.79	involve in the project,
499.385	including Margaret Jull Costa,
499.385	a leader in her field,
503.767	who has translated the work
503.767	of Nobel Prize winner José Saramago.
510.443	With my nine volunteers in place,
512.402	I managed to find a book
512.402	by a São Toméan author
515.014	that I could buy enough copies of online.
517.548	Here's one of them.
519.268	And I sent a copy out
519.268	to each of my volunteers.
522.856	They all took on a couple
522.856	of short stories from this collection,
526.054	stuck to their word, sent
526.054	their translations back to me,
529.705	and within six weeks,
529.705	I had the entire book to read.
534.422	In that case, as I found so often
534.422	during my year of reading the world,
538.908	my not knowing and being open
538.908	about my limitations
543.017	had become a big opportunity.
545.935	When it came to São Tomé and Príncipe,
548.146	it was a chance not only
548.146	to learn something new
551.516	and discover a new collection of stories,
554.215	but also to bring together
554.215	a group of people
557.185	and facilitate a joint creative endeavor.
560.901	My weakness had become
560.901	the project's strength.
565.929	The books I read that year
565.929	opened my eyes to many things.
569.509	As those who enjoy reading will know,
571.72	books have an extraordinary power
571.72	to take you out of yourself
575.524	and into someone else's mindset,
577.692	so that, for a while at least,
579.558	you look at the world
579.558	through different eyes.
582.39	That can be an uncomfortable experience,
584.877	particularly if you're reading a book
586.673	from a culture that may have quite
586.673	different values to your own.
590.601	But it can also be really enlightening.
593.402	Wrestling with unfamiliar ideas
593.402	can help clarify your own thinking.
597.742	And it can also show up blind spots
599.933	in the way you might have
599.933	been looking at the world.
603.072	When I looked back at much
603.072	of the English-language literature
605.978	I'd grown up with, for example,
607.688	I began to see how narrow a lot of it was,
610.749	compared to the richness
610.749	that the world has to offer.
614.886	And as the pages turned,
617.072	something else started to happen, too.
620.15	Little by little,
621.325	that long list of countries that
621.325	I'd started the year with, changed
625.634	from a rather dry, academic
625.634	register of place names
630.017	into living, breathing entities.
633.475	Now, I don't want to suggest
633.475	that it's at all possible
636.222	to get a rounded picture of a country
636.222	simply by reading one book.
641.01	But cumulatively, the stories
641.01	I read that year
644.623	made me more alive than ever before
647.707	to the richness, diversity and complexity
647.707	of our remarkable planet.
654.654	It was as though the world's stories
656.671	and the people who'd gone
656.671	to such lengths to help me read them
660.595	had made it real to me.
664.086	These days, when I look at my bookshelves
666.645	or consider the works on my e-reader,
669.794	they tell a rather different story.
672.649	It's the story of the power
672.649	books have to connect us
676.019	across political, geographical,
676.019	cultural, social, religious divides.
681.422	It's the tale of the potential
681.422	human beings have to work together.
686.32	And, it's testament
687.686	to the extraordinary times we live
687.686	in, where, thanks to the Internet,
692.333	it's easier than ever before
694.274	for a stranger to share a story,
694.274	a worldview, a book
698.727	with someone she may never meet,
698.727	on the other side of the planet.
703.595	I hope it's a story I'm reading
703.595	for many years to come.
707.074	And I hope many more people will join me.
709.947	If we all read more widely,
709.947	there'd be more incentive
712.585	for publishers to translate more books,
715.156	and we would all be richer for that.
717.713	Thank you.
718.894	(Applause)
