13.179	So last year, on the Fourth of July,
15.523	experiments at the Large Hadron Collider
18.022	discovered the Higgs boson.
20.312	It was a historical day.
22.28	There's no doubt that from now on,
24.575	the Fourth of July will be remembered
26.409	not as the day of the Declaration of Independence,
28.851	but as the day of the discovery of the Higgs boson.
32.685	Well, at least, here at CERN.
35.117	But for me, the biggest surprise of that day
39.272	was that there was no big surprise.
41.771	In the eye of a theoretical physicist,
44.37	the Higgs boson is a clever explanation
46.263	of how some elementary particles gain mass,
49.786	but it seems a fairly unsatisfactory
52.622	and incomplete solution.
54.828	Too many questions are left unanswered.
57.852	The Higgs boson does not share the beauty,
60.687	the symmetry, the elegance,
62.572	of the rest of the elementary particle world.
65.3	For this reason, the majority of theoretical physicists
68.922	believe that the Higgs boson could not
71.864	be the full story.
74.346	We were expecting new particles and new phenomena
77.2	accompanying the Higgs boson.
79.65	Instead, so far, the measurements
81.968	coming from the LHC show no signs of new particles
85.726	or unexpected phenomena.
87.875	Of course, the verdict is not definitive.
91.528	In 2015, the LHC will almost double
95.522	the energy of the colliding protons,
98.213	and these more powerful collisions
100.284	will allow us to explore further the particle world,
104.868	and we will certainly learn much more.
108	But for the moment, since we have found
111.146	no evidence for new phenomena, let us suppose
114.295	that the particles that we know today,
117.459	including the Higgs boson,
119.315	are the only elementary particles in nature,
122.6	even at energies much larger
125.344	than what we have explored so far.
128.11	Let's see where this hypothesis is going to lead us.
132.742	We will find a surprising and intriguing result
136.174	about our universe, and to explain my point,
139.973	let me first tell you what the Higgs is about,
143.849	and to do so, we have to go back
146.983	to one tenth of a billionth of a second
151.34	after the Big Bang.
152.871	And according to the Higgs theory,
154.912	at that instant, a dramatic event took place
158.278	in the universe.
159.869	Space-time underwent a phase transition.
164.66	It was something very similar to the phase transition
167.737	that occurs when water turns into ice
171.282	below zero degrees.
173.243	But in our case, the phase transition
176.183	is not a change in the way the molecules
178.714	are arranged inside the material,
181	but is about a change
182.888	of the very fabric of space-time.
186.514	During this phase transition, empty space
189.14	became filled with a substance
191.812	that we now call Higgs field.
194.844	And this substance may seem invisible to us,
197.173	but it has a physical reality.
199.851	It surrounds us all the time,
201.909	just like the air we breathe in this room.
205.61	And some elementary particles interact
207.928	with this substance, gaining energy in the process.
211.756	And this intrinsic energy is what we call
214.831	the mass of a particle,
216.964	and by discovering the Higgs boson, the LHC
220.217	has conclusively proved that this substance is real,
224.749	because it is the stuff the Higgs bosons are made of.
228.668	And this, in a nutshell, is the essence of the Higgs story.
232.112	But this story is far more interesting than that.
236.855	By studying the Higgs theory,
239.166	theoretical physicists discovered,
241.526	not through an experiment
243.43	but with the power of mathematics,
245.906	that the Higgs field does not necessarily exist
249.618	only in the form that we observe today.
252.955	Just like matter can exist as liquid or solid,
258	so the Higgs field, the substance that fills all space-time,
262.572	could exist in two states.
265.926	Besides the known Higgs state,
268.236	there could be a second state in which the Higgs field
271.383	is billions and billions times denser
274.919	than what we observe today,
276.964	and the mere existence of another state
280.451	of the Higgs field poses a potential problem.
284.696	This is because, according to the laws
287.934	of quantum mechanics, it is possible
290.627	to have transitions between two states,
293.459	even in the presence of an energy barrier
296.408	separating the two states,
299.036	and the phenomenon is called,
301.245	quite appropriately, quantum tunneling.
305.387	Because of quantum tunneling,
307.278	I could disappear from this room
309.811	and reappear in the next room,
313.133	practically penetrating the wall.
316.528	But don't expect me to actually perform the trick
319.343	in front of your eyes, because the probability
321.921	for me to penetrate the wall is ridiculously small.
326.309	You would have to wait a really long time
328.907	before it happens, but believe me,
331.039	quantum tunneling is a real phenomenon,
334.216	and it has been observed in many systems.
337.411	For instance, the tunnel diode,
339.973	a component used in electronics,
342.17	works thanks to the wonders
344.592	of quantum tunneling.
346.912	But let's go back to the Higgs field.
349.204	If the ultra-dense Higgs state existed,
353.767	then, because of quantum tunneling,
356.121	a bubble of this state could suddenly appear
359.834	in a certain place of the universe at a certain time,
363.076	and it is analogous to what happens when you boil water.
366.841	Bubbles of vapor form inside the water,
369.93	then they expand, turning liquid into gas.
373.786	In the same way, a bubble of the ultra-dense Higgs state
378.59	could come into existence because of quantum tunneling.
382.017	The bubble would then expand at the speed of light,
384.854	invading all space, and turning the Higgs field
388.34	from the familiar state into a new state.
391.989	Is this a problem? Yes, it's a big a problem.
396.15	We may not realize it in ordinary life,
398.895	but the intensity of the Higgs field is critical
402.1	for the structure of matter.
404.745	If the Higgs field were only a few times more intense,
408.818	we would see atoms shrinking, neutrons decaying
411.762	inside atomic nuclei, nuclei disintegrating,
415.448	and hydrogen would be
417.788	the only possible chemical element in the universe.
422.14	And the Higgs field, in the ultra-dense Higgs state,
425.151	is not just a few times more intense than today,
428.965	but billions of times,
431.16	and if space-time were filled by this Higgs state,
434.362	all atomic matter would collapse.
437.515	No molecular structures would be possible, no life.
442.005	So, I wonder, is it possible
445.343	that in the future, the Higgs field
447.929	will undergo a phase transition and,
450.494	through quantum tunneling, will be transformed
453.623	into this nasty, ultra-dense state?
458.31	In other words, I ask myself, what is the fate
461.835	of the Higgs field in our universe?
464.918	And the crucial ingredient necessary
467.169	to answer this question is the Higgs boson mass.
471.555	And experiments at the LHC found that the mass
475.666	of the Higgs boson is about 126 GeV.
479.94	This is tiny when expressed in familiar units,
482.976	because it's equal to something like
486.503	but it is large in particle physics units,
490.473	because it is equal to the weight
492.577	of an entire molecule
494.823	of a DNA constituent.
497.243	So armed with this information from the LHC,
500.63	together with some colleagues here at CERN,
502.574	we computed the probability
504.483	that our universe could quantum tunnel
507.498	into the ultra-dense Higgs state,
510.616	and we found a very intriguing result.
514.293	Our calculations showed
516.442	that the measured value of the Higgs boson mass
519.614	is very special.
521.459	It has just the right value
524.378	to keep the universe hanging
527.071	in an unstable situation.
529.641	The Higgs field is in a wobbly configuration
532.897	that has lasted so far
534.946	but that will eventually collapse.
537.991	So according to these calculations,
541.17	we are like campers
543.2	who accidentally set their tent
545.652	at the edge of a cliff.
547.446	And eventually, the Higgs field
549.236	will undergo a phase transition
551.172	and matter will collapse into itself.
554.216	So is this how humanity is going to disappear?
557.66	I don't think so.
559.415	Our calculation shows that quantum tunneling
562.768	of the Higgs field is not likely to occur
566.424	in the next 10 to the 100 years,
569.928	and this is a very long time.
572.97	It's even longer than
574.738	the time it takes for Italy to form a stable government.
578.407	(Laughter)
580.814	Even so, we will be long gone by then.
584.605	In about five billion years,
587.213	our sun will become a red giant,
589.67	as large as the Earth's orbit,
592.183	and our Earth will be kaput,
595.46	and in a thousand billion years,
597.817	if dark energy keeps on fueling
600.103	space expansion at the present rate,
602.938	you will not even be able to see as far as your toes,
607.115	because everything around you
608.812	expands at a rate faster than the speed of light.
612.513	So it is really unlikely
614.498	that we will be around to see the Higgs field collapse.
618.368	But the reason why I am interested
621.947	in the transition of the Higgs field
623.959	is because I want to address the question,
627.244	why is the Higgs boson mass so special?
632.209	Why is it just right to keep the universe
635.183	at the edge of a phase transition?
638.673	"Theoretical physicists always ask ""why"" questions."
642.535	More than how a phenomenon works,
645.21	theoretical physicists are always interested in
647.682	why a phenomenon works in the way it works.
650.914	"We think that this these ""why"" questions"
654.276	can give us clues
655.999	about the fundamental principles of nature.
659.537	And indeed, a possible answer to my question
663.442	opens up new universes, literally.
667.806	It has been speculated that our universe
671.247	is only a bubble in a soapy multiverse
675.38	made out of a multitude of bubbles,
677.943	and each bubble is a different universe
680.159	with different fundamental constants
682.053	and different physical laws.
683.918	And in this context, you can only talk about
685.924	the probability of finding a certain value of the Higgs mass.
690.635	Then the key to the mystery
692.978	could lie in the statistical properties
696.241	of the multiverse.
698.469	It would be something like what happens
700.883	with sand dunes on a beach.
703.12	In principle, you could imagine to find sand dunes
705.992	of any slope angle in a beach,
708.422	and yet, the slope angles of sand dunes
712.583	are typically around 30, 35 degrees.
716.053	And the reason is simple:
717.721	because wind builds up the sand, gravity makes it fall.
721.399	As a result, the vast majority of sand dunes
724.283	have slope angles around the critical value,
728.202	near to collapse.
730.186	And something similar could happen
733.183	for the Higgs boson mass in the multiverse.
737.72	In the majority of bubble universes,
740.592	the Higgs mass could be around the critical value,
743.649	near to a cosmic collapse of the Higgs field,
747.245	because of two competing effects,
749.192	just as in the case of sand.
752.778	My story does not have an end,
755.923	because we still don't know the end of the story.
759.658	This is science in progress,
762.946	and to solve the mystery, we need more data,
766.78	and hopefully, the LHC will soon add new clues
771.396	to this story.
774.017	Just one number, the Higgs boson mass,
777.847	and yet, out of this number we learn so much.
783.176	I started from a hypothesis, that the known particles
786.223	are all there is in the universe,
788.259	even beyond the domain explored so far.
790.965	From this, we discovered that the Higgs field
794.733	that permeates space-time may be standing
798.176	on a knife edge, ready for cosmic collapse,
802.733	and we discovered that this may be a hint
806.283	that our universe is only a grain of sand
810.316	in a giant beach, the multiverse.
813.929	But I don't know if my hypothesis is right.
817.18	That's how physics works: A single measurement
820.863	can put us on the road to a new understanding
823.727	of the universe
825.39	or it can send us down a blind alley.
828.409	But whichever it turns out to be,
830.973	there is one thing I'm sure of:
834.165	The journey will be full of surprises.
837.514	Thank you.
838.887	(Applause)
