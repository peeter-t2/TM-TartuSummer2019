12.441	Two years ago, I was invited as an artist
15.47	to participate in an exhibition commemorating
20.988	The curator had only one condition:
23.428	I had to use the Arabic script for my artwork.
26.918	Now, as an artist, a woman, an Arab,
30.029	or a human being living in the world in 2010,
33.671	I only had one thing to say:
36.636	I wanted to say no.
39.446	"And in Arabic, to say ""no,"" we say ""no,"
41.662	"and a thousand times no."""
43.982	So I decided to look for a thousand different noes.
47.778	on everything ever produced
49.624	under Islamic or Arab patronage in the past 1,400 years,
54.305	from Spain to the borders of China.
58.186	I collected my findings in a book,
60.185	placed them chronologically, stating the name,
63.629	the patron, the medium and the date.
67.099	Now, the book sat on a small shelf next to the installation,
70.298	which stood three by seven meters, in Munich, Germany,
73.905	in September of 2010.
77.419	Now, in January, 2011, the revolution started,
83.323	and life stopped for 18 days,
86.146	and on the 12th of February,
87.605	we naively celebrated on the streets of Cairo,
90.593	believing that the revolution had succeeded.
94.626	Nine months later I found myself spraying messages
98.282	in Tahrir Square. The reason for this act
102.482	was this image that I saw in my newsfeed.
106.241	I did not feel that I could live in a city
109.137	where people were being killed
111.144	and thrown like garbage on the street.
114.112	"So I took one ""no"" off a tombstone from"
116.438	the Islamic Museum in Cairo, and I added a message to it:
120.023	"""no to military rule."""
121.69	And I started spraying that on the streets in Cairo.
124.706	But that led to a series of no, coming out of the book
127.737	like ammunition, and adding messages to them,
130.706	and I started spraying them on the walls.
133.106	So I'll be sharing some of these noes with you.
135.812	No to a new Pharaoh, because whoever comes next
138.41	should understand that we will never be ruled by another dictator.
142.316	No to violence: Ramy Essam came to Tahrir
146.462	on the second day of the revolution,
148.33	and he sat there with this guitar, singing.
151.79	One month after Mubarak stepped down, this was his reward.
156.079	No to blinding heroes. Ahmed Harara lost his right eye
161.105	on the 28th of January,
162.856	and he lost his left eye on the 19th of November,
166.202	by two different snipers.
169.688	No to killing, in this case no to killing men of religion,
173.013	because Sheikh Ahmed Adina Refaat was shot
176.199	on December 16th, during a demonstration,
179.561	leaving behind three orphans and a widow.
183.421	No to burning books. The Institute of Egypt was burned
186.704	on December 17th, a huge cultural loss.
190.924	No to stripping the people,
193.313	and the blue bra is to remind us of our shame
196.807	as a nation when we allow a veiled woman to be stripped
200.757	and beaten on the street, and the footprint reads,
204.758	"""Long live a peaceful revolution,"""
206.91	because we will never retaliate with violence.
210.43	No to barrier walls. On February 5th,
213.845	concrete roadblocks were set up in Cairo
218.038	to protect the Ministry of Defense from protesters.
223.719	Now, speaking of walls, I want to share with you the story
226.164	of one wall in Cairo.
228.966	A group of artists decided to paint a life-size tank
233.273	on a wall. It's one to one.
235.115	In front of this tank there's a man on a bicycle
238.979	with a breadbasket on his head. To any passerby,
242.093	there's no problem with this visual.
244.947	After acts of violence, another artist came,
248.861	painted blood, protesters being run over by the tank,
253.334	demonstrators, and a message that read,
256.38	"""Starting tomorrow, I wear the new face,"
259.727	"the face of every martyr. I exist."""
263.446	Authority comes, paints the wall white,
266.347	leaves the tank and adds a message:
268.989	"""Army and people, one hand. Egypt for Egyptians."""
274.018	Another artist comes, paints the head of the military
277.653	as a monster eating a maiden in a river of blood
281.015	in front of the tank.
283.707	Authority comes, paints the wall white, leaves the tank,
287.708	leaves the suit, and throws a bucket of black paint
290.336	just to hide the face of the monster.
291.943	So I come with my stencils, and I spray them on the suit,
295.836	on the tank, and on the whole wall,
298.261	and this is how it stands today
300.335	until further notice. (Laughter)
302.114	Now, I want to leave you with a final no.
306.38	I found Neruda scribbled on a piece of paper
309.995	in a field hospital in Tahrir, and I decided to take a no of
315.224	Mamluk Mausoleum in Cairo.
317.538	The message reads,
319.323	[Arabic]
325.732	"""You can crush the flowers, but you can't delay spring."""
329.409	Thank you. (Applause)
333.264	(Applause)
342.285	Thank you. Shukran. (Applause)
