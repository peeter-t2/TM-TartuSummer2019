13.285	I don't know if you've noticed,
14.379	but there's been a spate of books
16.051	that have come out lately
17.926	contemplating or speculating
20.068	on the cognition and emotional life of dogs.
24.479	Do they think, do they feel and, if so, how?
27.35	So this afternoon, in my limited time,
29.29	I wanted to take the guesswork out of a lot of that
31.985	by introducing you to two dogs,
34.481	"both of whom have taken the command ""speak"""
39.305	quite literally.
43.266	The first dog is the first to go,
46.026	and he is contemplating an aspect
50.275	of his relationship to his owner,
52.431	"and the title is ""A Dog on His Master."""
57.431	"""As young as I look,"
59.411	I am growing older faster than he.
62.361	Seven to one is the ratio, they tend to say.
66.386	Whatever the number, I will pass him one day
69.971	and take the lead,
71.839	the way I do on our walks in the woods,
74.76	and if this ever manages to cross his mind,
78.258	it would be the sweetest shadow
80.564	"I have ever cast on snow or grass."""
85.616	(Applause)
88.195	Thank you.
91.001	And our next dog
94.14	speaks in something called the revenant,
97.661	which means a spirit that comes back
99.692	to visit you.
103.458	"""I am the dog you put to sleep,"
107.326	as you like to call the needle of oblivion,
110.778	come back to tell you this simple thing:
113.68	"I never liked you."""
115.304	(Laughter)
117.914	"""When I licked your face,"
119.808	I thought of biting off your nose.
122.701	When I watched you toweling yourself dry,
125.68	I wanted to leap and unman you with a snap.
129.788	I resented the way you moved,
131.97	your lack of animal grace,
133.856	the way you would sit in a chair to eat,
136.401	a napkin on your lap, a knife in your hand.
140.703	I would have run away
142.161	but I was too weak,
143.911	a trick you taught me
145.547	while I was learning to sit and heel
148.612	and, greatest of insults,
150.745	shake hands without a hand.
154.923	I admit the sight of the leash would excite me,
158.427	but only because it meant I was about to smell things
161.224	you had never touched.
166.063	You do not want to believe this,
167.999	but I have no reason to lie:
170.365	I hated the car, hated the rubber toys,
174.449	disliked your friends, and worse, your relatives.
179.235	The jingling of my tags drove me mad.
183.183	"You always scratched me in the wrong place."""
186.43	(Laughter)
188.432	"""All I ever wanted from you was food and water"
191.21	in my bowls.
193.402	While you slept, I watched you breathe
195.475	as the moon rose in the sky.
197.805	It took all of my strength
199.422	not to raise my head and howl.
202.478	Now, I am free of the collar,
204.978	free of the yellow raincoat,
207.488	monogrammed sweater,
209.366	the absurdity of your lawn,
212.396	and that is all you need to know about this place,
215.139	except what you already supposed
218.24	and are glad it did not happen sooner,
220.642	that everyone here can read and write,
223.883	the dogs in poetry,
227.233	the cats and all the others
230.24	"in prose."""
232.63	Thank you.
234.33	(Applause)
