16.235	In 1975, I met in Florence a professor, Carlo Pedretti,
20.307	my former professor of art history, and today
23.637	a world-renowned scholar of Leonardo da Vinci.
27.823	Well, he asked me if I could find some technological way
31.794	to unfold a five-centuries-old mystery related to
35.582	a lost masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci,
38.395	"the ""Battle of Anghiari,"" which is supposed to be located"
41.022	in the Hall of the 500 in Palazzo Vecchio, in Florence.
43.968	Well, in the mid-'70s, there were not great opportunities
47.071	for a bioengineer like me, especially in Italy, and so
50.998	I decided, with some researchers from the United States
54.868	and the University of Florence, to start probing the murals
59.079	decorated by Vasari on the long walls of the Hall of the 500
63.198	searching for the lost Leonardo.
65.875	Unfortunately, at that time we did not know that
69.329	that was not exactly where we should be looking,
73.671	because we had to go much deeper in, and so the research
77.809	came to a halt, and it was only taken up in 2000
82.144	thanks to the interest and the enthusiasm of the Guinness family.
86.375	Well, this time, we focused on trying to reconstruct
89.614	the way the Hall of the 500 was before the remodeling,
92.47	and the so-called Sala Grande, which was built in 1494,
96.275	and to find out the original doors, windows,
99.155	and in order to do that, we first created a 3D model,
103.914	and then, with thermography, we went on to discover
107.016	hidden windows. These are the original windows of the hall
110.247	of the Sala Grande. We also found out about the height
113.825	of the ceiling, and we managed to reconstruct, therefore,
117.138	all the layout of this original hall
119.786	the way it was before there came Vasari,
123.341	and restructured the whole thing,
125.936	including a staircase that was very important
129.272	"in order to precisely place ""The Battle of Anghiari"""
133.411	on a specific area of one of the two walls.
137.675	Well, we also learned that Vasari, who was commissioned
140.916	to remodel the Hall of the 500 between 1560 and 1574
145.404	by the Grand Duke Cosimo I of the Medici family,
149.736	we have at least two instances when he saved masterpieces
153.177	specifically by placing a brick wall in front of it
156.434	and leaving a small air gap.
158.799	One that we [see] here, Masaccio, the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence,
162.487	so we just said, well maybe, Visari has done something
165.605	like that in the case of this great work of art by Leonardo,
168.991	since he was a great admirer of Leonardo da Vinci.
171.476	And so we built some very sophisticated radio antennas
175.983	just for probing both walls and searching for an air gap.
181.211	And we did find many on the right panel of the east wall,
186.046	an air gap, and that's where
188.668	"we believe ""The Battle of Anghiari,"""
190.218	or at least the part that we know has been painted,
192.184	"which is called ""The Fight for the Standard,"" should be located."
195.512	Well, from there, unfortunately,
199.105	in 2004, the project
201.759	came to a halt. Many political reasons.
204.906	So I decided to go back to my alma mater,
207.24	and, at the University of California, San Diego,
209.912	and I proposed to open up a research center
212.278	for engineering sciences for cultural heritage.
215.09	And in 2007, we created CISA3 as a research center
219.613	for cultural heritage, specifically art, architecture
222.426	and archaeology. So students started to flow in,
225.189	and we started to build technologies, because that's
227.323	basically what we also needed in order to move forward
229.972	and go and do fieldwork.
232.732	We came back in the Hall of the 500 in 2011,
237.13	and this time, with a great group of students,
240.761	and my colleague, Professor Falko Kuester,
243.201	who is now the director at CISA3, and we
245.903	came back just since we knew already where to look for
250.076	to find out if there was still something left.
253.056	Well, we were confined though, limited, I should rather say,
257.189	for several reasons that it's not worth explaining,
260.186	to endoscopy only, of the many other options we had,
263.932	and with a 4mm camera attached to it,
267.727	we were successful in documenting and taking
272.516	some fragments of what it turns out to be
277.32	a reddish color, black color, and there is some
280.92	beige fragments that later on
284.317	we ran a much more sophisticated exams,
287.311	XRF, X-ray diffraction, and the results are very positive
292.551	so far. It seems to indicate that indeed
295.214	we have found some pigments, and since we know for sure
298.27	that no other artist has painted on that wall
300.571	before Vasari came in about 60 years later, well,
304.09	those pigments are therefore firmly related to mural painting
306.951	and most likely to Leonardo.
309.566	Well, we are searching for the highest and highly praised
314.389	work of art ever achieved by mankind.
317.63	As a matter of fact, this is by far the most important
320.835	commission that Leonardo has ever had,
323.671	and for doing this great masterpiece, he was named
328.284	the number one artist influence at the time.
333.089	I had also had the privilege since the last 37 years
336.696	to work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me,
340.356	but basically to do what? Well, to assess, for example,
343.427	the state of conservation. See here the face of the
345.983	Madonna of the Chair that when just shining a UV light on it
350.707	you suddenly see another, different lady,
353.395	aged lady, I should rather say.
355.69	There is a lot of varnish still sitting there, several retouches,
359.279	and some over cleaning. It becomes very visible.
362.126	But also, technology has helped to write new pages
365.883	of our history, or at least to update pages of our histories.
368.805	"For example, the ""Lady with the Unicorn,"""
370.943	another painting by Rafael, well, you see the unicorn.
373.421	A lot has been said and written about the unicorn, but
375.893	if you take an X-ray of the unicorn, it becomes a puppy dog.
379.57	And — (Laughter) — no problem, but, unfortunately,
383.929	continuing with the scientific examination of this painting
386.707	came out that Rafael did not paint the unicorn,
389.707	did not paint the puppy dog, actually left the painting
392.364	unfinished, so all this writing about the exotic symbol
397.1	of the unicorn — (Laughter) — unfortunately,
399.991	is not very reliable. (Laughter)
403.151	Well, also, authenticity. Just think for a moment
405.751	if science really could move in the field of authenticity
409.846	of works of art. There would be a cultural revolution
413.234	to say the least, but also, I would say, a market revolution,
416.395	let me add. Take this example:
418.787	"Otto Marseus, nice painting, which is ""Still Life"""
422.481	at the Pitti Gallery, and just have an infrared camera peering through,
426.576	and luckily for art historians, it just was confirmed
430.311	that there is a signature of Otto Marseus. It even says
432.911	when it was made and also the location.
435.926	So that was a good result. Sometimes, it's not that good,
440.325	and so, again, authenticity and science could go together
445.489	and change the way, not attributions being made,
449.786	but at least lay the ground for a more objective,
453.629	or, I should rather say, less subjective attribution,
457.35	as it is done today.
460.098	But I would say the discovery that really caught
463.392	my imagination, my admiration, is the incredibly vivid
467.499	drawing under this layer, brown layer,
471.111	"of ""The Adoration of the Magi."" Here you see"
474.363	a handmade setting XYZ scanner with an infrared camera put on it,
478.793	and just peering through this brown layer
482	of this masterpiece to reveal
484.751	what could have been underneath.
487.451	Well, this happens to be the most important painting
489.803	we have in Italy by Leonardo da Vinci, and
492.66	look at the wonderful images of faces that nobody has seen
497.396	for five centuries. Look at these portraits.
501.087	They're magnificent. You see Leonardo at work.
503.46	You see the geniality of his creation, right directly
507.117	on the ground layer of the panel, and see
510.024	this cool thing, finding, I should rather say,
516.096	an elephant. (Laughter) Because of this elephant,
519.358	over 70 new images came out, never seen for centuries.
523.127	This was an epiphany. We came to understand
526.457	and to prove that the brown coating that we see today
530.183	was not done by Leonardo da Vinci, which left us
532.95	only the other drawing that for five centuries
535.457	we were not able to see, so thanks only to technology.
540.667	Well, the tablet. Well, we thought, well, if we all have
545.043	this pleasure, this privilege to see all this,
547.821	to find all these discoveries, what about for everybody else?
551.359	So we thought of an augmented reality application
554.201	using a tablet. Let me show you just simulating
558.489	what we could be doing, any of us could be doing,
562.078	in a museum environment.
564.253	So let's say that we go to a museum with a tablet, okay?
568.715	And we just aim the camera of the tablet
572.011	to the painting that we are interested to see, like this.
578.142	Okay? And I will just click on it, we pause,
584.016	and now let me turn to you so the moment the image,
588.178	or, I should say, the camera, has locked in the painting,
591.531	then the images you just saw up there in the drawing
594.197	are being loaded. And so, see.
597.954	We can, as we said, we can zoom in. Then we can scroll.
601.757	Okay? Let's go and find the elephant.
606.702	So all we need is one finger. Just wipe off
609.959	and we see the elephant. (Applause)
614.5	(Applause)
618.044	Okay? And then if we want,
620.756	we can continue the scroll to find out, for example,
623.536	on the staircase, the whole iconography is going
627.631	to be changed. There are a lot of laymen reconstructing
629.959	from the ruins of an old temple a new temple,
632.59	and there are a lot of figures showing up. See?
636.378	This is not just a curiosity, because it changes
639.584	not just the iconography as you see it, but the iconology,
642.632	the meaning of the painting,
644.983	and we believe this is a cool way, easy way,
647.773	that everybody could have access to, to become more
650.913	the protagonist of your own discovery, and not just
654.006	be so passive about it, as we are when we walk through
657.38	endless rooms of museums.
661.574	(Applause)
666.91	Another concept is the digital clinical chart, which sounds
670.667	very obvious if we were to talk about real patients,
673.142	but when we talk about works of art, unfortunately,
675.398	it's never been tapped as an idea.
677.53	Well, we believe, again, that this should be the beginning,
680.085	the very first step, to do real conservation,
682.57	and allowing us to really explore and to understand
686.058	everything related to the state of our conservation,
688.849	the technique, materials, and also if, when, and why
692.223	we should restore, or, rather, to intervene on
696.814	the environment surrounding the painting.
700.345	Well, our vision is to rediscover
703.755	the spirit of the Renaissance, create a new discipline
706.164	where engineering for cultural heritage is actually
709.773	a symbol of blending art and science together.
712.475	We definitely need a new breed of engineers
714.905	that will go out and do this kind of work and
717.638	rediscover for us these values, these cultural values
721.98	that we badly need, especially today.
724.534	And if you want to summarize in one just single word,
728.268	well, this is what we're trying to do.
731.184	We're trying to give a future to our past
733.422	in order to have a future.
735.824	As long as we live a life of curiosity and passion,
738.892	there is a bit of Leonardo in all of us. Thank you. (Applause)
743.078	(Applause)
