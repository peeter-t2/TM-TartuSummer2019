12.835	This story starts with these two --
15.852	my kids.
17.134	We were hiking in the Oakland woods
18.84	when my daughter noticed
18.84	a plastic tub of cat litter in a creek.
23.467	She looked at me and said,
25.153	"""Daddy?"
27.684	"That doesn't go there."""
29.358	When she said that,
29.358	it reminded me of summer camp.
31.804	On the morning of visiting day,
33.326	right before they'd let our anxious
33.326	parents come barreling through the gates,
37.013	our camp director would say,
38.406	"""Quick! Everyone pick up"
38.406	"five pieces of litter."""
40.739	You get a couple hundred kids
40.739	each picking up five pieces,
43.803	and pretty soon, you've got
43.803	a much cleaner camp.
46.4	So I thought,
47.583	why not apply that crowdsourced
47.583	cleanup model to the entire planet?
52.144	And that was the inspiration
52.144	for Litterati.
55.119	The vision is to create
55.119	a litter-free world.
58.492	Let me show you how it started.
60.024	I took a picture of a cigarette
60.024	using Instagram.
64.042	Then I took another photo ...
65.933	and another photo ...
67.514	and another photo.
68.705	And I noticed two things:
70.015	one, litter became artistic
70.015	and approachable;
74.064	and two,
75.239	at the end of a few days,
75.239	I had 50 photos on my phone
77.778	and I had picked up each piece,
79.389	and I realized that I was keeping a record
81.798	of the positive impact
81.798	I was having on the planet.
84.973	That's 50 less things that you might see,
87.185	or you might step on,
88.452	or some bird might eat.
90.589	So I started telling people
90.589	what I was doing,
93.265	and they started participating.
96.651	One day,
98.368	this photo showed up from China.
101.859	And that's when I realized
103.154	that Litterati was more
103.154	than just pretty pictures;
106.444	we were becoming a community
106.444	that was collecting data.
110.689	Each photo tells a story.
113.099	It tells us who picked up what,
115.316	a geotag tells us where
117.351	and a time stamp tells us when.
119.826	So I built a Google map,
122.279	and started plotting the points
122.279	where pieces were being picked up.
126.356	And through that process,
126.356	the community grew
130.298	and the data grew.
132.626	My two kids go to school
132.626	right in that bullseye.
136.945	Litter:
138.18	it's blending into
138.18	the background of our lives.
140.908	But what if we brought it
140.908	to the forefront?
143.031	What if we understood exactly
143.031	what was on our streets,
145.967	our sidewalks
147.38	and our school yards?
148.942	How might we use that data
148.942	to make a difference?
153.009	Well, let me show you.
154.231	The first is with cities.
156.238	San Francisco wanted to understand
156.238	what percentage of litter was cigarettes.
160.901	Why?
162.087	To create a tax.
163.893	So they put a couple of people
163.893	in the streets
166.052	with pencils and clipboards,
167.437	who walked around collecting information
169.524	which led to a 20-cent tax
169.524	on all cigarette sales.
173.607	And then they got sued
175.784	by big tobacco,
176.984	who claimed that collecting information
176.984	with pencils and clipboards
180.224	is neither precise nor provable.
183.274	The city called me and asked
183.274	if our technology could help.
186.978	I'm not sure they realized
188.251	that our technology
188.251	was my Instagram account --
190.523	(Laughter)
191.586	"But I said, ""Yes, we can."""
192.876	(Laughter)
193.916	"""And we can tell you"
193.916	if that's a Parliament or a Pall Mall.
197.848	Plus, every photograph
197.848	is geotagged and time-stamped,
201.297	"providing you with proof."""
203.659	Four days and 5,000 pieces later,
206.903	our data was used in court
206.903	to not only defend but double the tax,
211.865	generating an annual recurring revenue
211.865	of four million dollars
216.212	for San Francisco to clean itself up.
219.821	Now, during that process
219.821	I learned two things:
222.08	one, Instagram is not the right tool --
224.658	(Laughter)
225.713	so we built an app.
227.24	And two, if you think about it,
228.897	every city in the world
228.897	has a unique litter fingerprint,
232.538	and that fingerprint provides
232.538	both the source of the problem
236.398	and the path to the solution.
239.466	If you could generate a revenue stream
241.868	just by understanding
241.868	the percentage of cigarettes,
244.355	well, what about coffee cups
246.475	or soda cans
248.205	or plastic bottles?
250.321	If you could fingerprint San Francisco,
250.321	well, how about Oakland
253.546	or Amsterdam
255.266	or somewhere much closer to home?
259.228	And what about brands?
260.486	How might they use this data
262.411	to align their environmental
262.411	and economic interests?
267.466	There's a block in downtown Oakland
267.466	that's covered in blight.
271.145	The Litterati community got together
271.145	and picked up 1,500 pieces.
275.632	And here's what we learned:
276.996	most of that litter came
276.996	from a very well-known taco brand.
281.558	Most of that brand's litter
281.558	were their own hot sauce packets,
286.258	and most of those hot sauce packets
286.258	hadn't even been opened.
291.785	The problem and the path
291.785	to the solution --
294.524	well, maybe that brand only
294.524	gives out hot sauce upon request
298.509	or installs bulk dispensers
300.542	or comes up with more
300.542	sustainable packaging.
303.118	How does a brand take
303.118	an environmental hazard,
306.111	turn it into an economic engine
308.141	and become an industry hero?
311.112	If you really want to create change,
313.338	there's no better place to start
313.338	than with our kids.
316.236	A group of fifth graders picked up
316.236	1,247 pieces of litter
319.663	just on their school yard.
321.535	And they learned that the most
321.535	common type of litter
324.091	were the plastic straw wrappers
324.091	from their own cafeteria.
327.767	So these kids went
327.767	to their principal and asked,
330.32	"""Why are we still buying straws?"""
332.986	And they stopped.
334.765	And they learned that individually
334.765	they could each make a difference,
338.443	but together they created an impact.
341.323	It doesn't matter
341.323	if you're a student or a scientist,
345.359	whether you live in Honolulu or Hanoi,
348.518	this is a community for everyone.
351.794	It started because of two little kids
351.794	in the Northern California woods,
356.497	and today it's spread across the world.
359.758	And you know how we're getting there?
361.887	One piece at a time.
364.328	Thank you.
365.567	(Applause)
