13.142	I once said,
14.849	"""If you want to liberate a society,"
17.507	"all you need is the Internet."""
20.261	I was wrong.
22.121	I said those words back in 2011,
24.725	when a Facebook page I anonymously created
27.671	helped spark the Egyptian revolution.
30.724	The Arab Spring revealed
30.724	social media's greatest potential,
35.328	but it also exposed
35.328	its greatest shortcomings.
40.003	The same tool that united us
40.003	to topple dictators
45.055	eventually tore us apart.
48.229	I would like to share my own experience
48.229	in using social media for activism,
53.148	and talk about some of the challenges
53.148	I have personally faced
56.703	and what we could do about them.
59.818	In the early 2000s,
62.334	Arabs were flooding the web.
65.619	Thirsty for knowledge, for opportunities,
68.604	for connecting with the rest
68.604	of the people around the globe,
72.34	we escaped our frustrating
72.34	political realities
76.735	and lived a virtual, alternative life.
81.684	Just like many of them,
81.684	I was completely apolitical until 2009.
86.835	At the time, when I logged
86.835	into social media,
90.368	I started seeing more and more Egyptians
92.912	aspiring for political change
92.912	in the country.
96.244	It felt like I was not alone.
100.577	In June 2010,
102.308	Internet changed my life forever.
107.055	While browsing Facebook,
110.263	I saw a photo, a terrifying photo,
110.263	of a tortured, dead body
115.493	of a young Egyptian guy.
117.891	His name was Khaled Said.
121.08	Khaled was a 29-year-old Alexandrian
121.08	who was killed by police.
127.099	I saw myself in his picture.
129.924	"I thought, ""I could be Khaled."""
132.853	I could not sleep that night,
132.853	and I decided to do something.
137.542	I anonymously created a Facebook page
140.067	"and called it ""We are all Khaled Said."""
144.645	In just three days, the page
144.645	had over 100,000 people,
149.294	fellow Egyptians who shared
149.294	the same concern.
153.39	Whatever was happening had to stop.
156.631	I recruited my co-admin,
156.631	AbdelRahman Mansour.
160.059	We worked together for hours and hours.
162.956	We were crowdsourcing
162.956	ideas from the people.
165.908	We were engaging them.
167.376	We were calling collectively for actions,
169.964	and sharing news that the regime
169.964	did not want Egyptians to know.
174.733	The page became the most followed page
177.721	in the Arab world.
179.148	It had more fans than established
179.148	media organizations
183.526	and even top celebrities.
186.468	On January 14, 2011,
189.555	Ben Ali fled out of Tunisia
192.112	after mounting protests
192.112	against his regime.
195.589	I saw a spark of hope.
198.144	Egyptians on social media were wondering,
201.35	"""If Tunisia did it, why can't we?"""
204.715	I posted an event
204.715	on Facebook and called it
206.931	"""A Revolution against Corruption,"
206.931	"Injustice and Dictatorship."""
212.635	I posed a question to the 300,000 users
212.635	of the page at the time:
217.685	"""Today is the 14th of January."
220.969	The 25th of January is Police Day.
224.58	It's a national holiday.
226.283	If 100,000 of us take
226.283	to the streets of Cairo,
230.251	no one is going to stop us.
232.03	"I wonder if we could do it."""
234.797	In just a few days, the invitation
234.797	reached over a million people,
239.303	and over 100,000 people
239.303	confirmed attendance.
243.562	Social media was crucial
243.562	for this campaign.
246.329	It helped a decentralized movement arise.
249.999	It made people realize
249.999	that they were not alone.
252.927	And it made it impossible
252.927	for the regime to stop it.
256.259	At the time, they didn't
256.259	even understand it.
259.656	And on January 25th, Egyptians flooded
259.656	the streets of Cairo and other cities,
265.913	calling for change,
267.911	breaking the barrier of fear
270.23	and announcing a new era.
273.947	Then came the consequences.
276.592	A few hours before the regime cut off
276.592	the Internet and telecommunications,
281.395	I was walking in a dark street
281.395	in Cairo, around midnight.
286.075	"I had just tweeted, ""Pray for Egypt."
289.423	The government must be planning
289.423	"a massacre tomorrow."""
293.587	I was hit hard on my head.
296.589	I lost my balance and fell down,
298.723	to find four armed men surrounding me.
302.698	One covered my mouth
302.698	and the others paralyzed me.
306.711	I knew I was being kidnapped
306.711	by state security.
310.701	I found myself in a cell,
314.259	handcuffed, blindfolded.
317.027	I was terrified.
318.615	So was my family,
320.956	who started looking for me
322.605	in hospitals, police stations
322.605	and even morgues.
326.569	After my disappearance,
327.864	a few of my fellow colleagues who knew
327.864	I was the admin of the page
331.277	told the media about
331.277	my connection with that page,
335.5	and that I was likely arrested
335.5	by state security.
339.189	My colleagues at Google started
339.189	a search campaign trying to find me,
343.596	and the fellow protesters in the square
343.596	demanded my release.
348.088	After 11 days of complete darkness,
350.564	I was set free.
352.516	And three days later,
354.152	Mubarak was forced to step down.
357.505	It was the most inspiring
357.505	and empowering moment of my life.
362.633	It was a time of great hope.
365.265	Egyptians lived a utopia for 18 days
365.265	during the revolution.
369.685	They all shared the belief
371.581	that we could actually live together
371.581	despite our differences,
375.897	that Egypt after Mubarak would be for all.
379.267	But unfortunately,
380.538	the post-revolution events
380.538	were like a punch in the gut.
386.609	The euphoria faded,
388.775	we failed to build consensus,
391.84	and the political struggle
391.84	led to intense polarization.
395.813	Social media only amplified that state,
398.626	by facilitating the spread
398.626	of misinformation, rumors,
402.803	echo chambers and hate speech.
405.189	The environment was purely toxic.
408.265	My online world became a battleground
408.265	filled with trolls, lies, hate speech.
415.66	I started to worry
415.66	about the safety of my family.
419.655	But of course, this wasn't just about me.
423.145	The polarization reached its peak
423.145	between the two main powers --
428.093	the army supporters and the Islamists.
430.986	People in the center, like me,
433.418	started feeling helpless.
436.587	Both groups wanted you to side with them;
439.111	you were either with them or against them.
442.737	And on the 3rd of July 2013,
444.663	the army ousted Egypt's first
444.663	democratically elected president,
449.194	after three days of popular protest
449.194	that demanded his resignation.
454.519	That day I made a very hard decision.
457.688	I decided to go silent, completely silent.
462.106	It was a moment of defeat.
465.101	I stayed silent for more than two years,
467.929	and I used the time to reflect
467.929	on everything that happened,
471.394	trying to understand why did it happen.
474.773	It became clear to me
476.242	that while it's true that polarization
476.242	is primarily driven
481.187	by our human behavior,
483.046	social media shapes this behavior
483.046	and magnifies its impact.
488.315	Say you want to say something
488.315	that is not based on a fact,
491.43	pick a fight or ignore
491.43	someone that you don't like.
494.914	These are all natural human impulses,
497.645	but because of technology,
499.824	acting on these impulses
499.824	is only one click away.
504.562	In my view, there are five
504.562	critical challenges
507.529	facing today's social media.
510.794	First, we don't know
510.794	how to deal with rumors.
514.493	Rumors that confirm people's biases
517.243	are now believed and spread
517.243	among millions of people.
522.59	Second, we create our own echo chambers.
526.595	We tend to only communicate
526.595	with people that we agree with,
529.936	and thanks to social media,
532.124	we can mute, un-follow
532.124	and block everybody else.
538.247	Third, online discussions
538.247	quickly descend into angry mobs.
543.571	All of us probably know that.
545.833	It's as if we forget
547.651	that the people behind screens
547.651	are actually real people
550.935	and not just avatars.
553.254	And fourth, it became really hard
553.254	to change our opinions.
558.309	Because of the speed
558.309	and brevity of social media,
561.617	we are forced to jump to conclusions
564.575	and write sharp opinions in 140 characters
567.663	about complex world affairs.
570.402	And once we do that,
570.402	it lives forever on the Internet,
574.276	and we are less motivated
574.276	to change these views,
577.403	even when new evidence arises.
580.033	Fifth -- and in my point of view,
580.033	this is the most critical --
584.246	today, our social media experiences
584.246	are designed in a way
588.574	that favors broadcasting over engagements,
591.535	posts over discussions,
594.586	shallow comments over deep conversations.
597.764	It's as if we agreed that
597.764	we are here to talk at each other
601.838	instead of talking with each other.
605.244	I witnessed how these
605.244	critical challenges contributed
607.704	to an already polarized
607.704	Egyptian society,
611.041	but this is not just about Egypt.
613.601	Polarization is on the rise
613.601	in the whole world.
617.325	We need to work hard on figuring out
619.923	how technology could be
619.923	part of the solution,
623.268	rather than part of the problem.
627.072	There's a lot of debate today
627.072	on how to combat online harassment
630.436	and fight trolls.
631.992	This is so important.
633.818	No one could argue against that.
636.251	But we need to also think about how
636.251	to design social media experiences
641.492	that promote civility
641.492	and reward thoughtfulness.
645.512	I know for a fact
646.906	if I write a post
646.906	that is more sensational,
650.146	more one-sided, sometimes
650.146	angry and aggressive,
653.681	I get to have more people see that post.
656.791	I will get more attention.
659.726	But what if we put more focus on quality?
663.149	What is more important:
664.398	the total number of readers
664.398	of a post you write,
667.075	or who are the people who have impact
667.075	that read what you write?
672.846	Couldn't we just give people more
672.846	incentives to engage in conversations,
677.236	rather than just broadcasting
677.236	opinions all the time?
680.788	Or reward people for reading
682.21	and responding to views
682.21	that they disagree with?
686.082	And also, make it socially acceptable
686.082	that we change our minds,
690.819	or probably even reward that?
693.343	What if we have a matrix that says
693.343	how many people changed their minds,
697.516	and that becomes part
697.516	of our social media experience?
701.206	If I could track how many people
701.206	are changing their minds,
704.307	I'd probably write more
704.307	thoughtfully, trying to do that,
708.032	rather than appealing to the people
708.032	who already agree with me
711.761	"and ""liking"" because I just"
711.761	confirmed their biases.
715.512	We also need to think about effective
715.512	crowdsourcing mechanisms,
719.192	to fact-check widely spread
719.192	online information,
722.941	and reward people who take part in that.
725.924	In essence, we need to rethink
725.924	today's social media ecosystem
730.885	and redesign its experiences
733.164	to reward thoughtfulness, civility
733.164	and mutual understanding.
737.585	As a believer in the Internet,
737.585	I teamed up with a few friends,
740.867	started a new project,
742.374	trying to find answers
742.374	and explore possibilities.
746.63	Our first product is a new
746.63	media platform for conversations.
750.977	We're hosting conversations
750.977	that promote mutual understanding
754.263	and hopefully change minds.
756.348	We don't claim to have the answers,
758.779	but we started experimenting
758.779	with different discussions
762.168	about very divisive issues,
764.255	such as race, gun control,
764.255	the refugee debate,
768.426	relationship between Islam and terrorism.
771.217	These are conversations that matter.
774.779	Today, at least one out of three
774.779	people on the planet
779.81	have access to the Internet.
782.226	But part of this Internet
782.226	is being held captive
786.05	by the less noble aspects
786.05	of our human behavior.
790.774	Five years ago, I said,
793.148	"""If you want to liberate society,"
796.943	"all you need is the Internet."""
799.207	Today, I believe if we want
799.207	to liberate society,
804.266	we first need to liberate the Internet.
807.193	Thank you very much.
808.385	(Applause)
