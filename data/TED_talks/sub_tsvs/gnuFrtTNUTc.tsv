21.553	When I was 14 years old,
24.643	I had low self-esteem.
26.63	I felt I was not talented at anything.
31.314	One day, I bought a yo-yo.
35.533	When I tried my first trick,
35.533	it looked like this:
40.771	(Laughter)
45.553	I couldn't even do the simplest trick,
48.355	but it was very natural for me,
50.696	because I was not dextrous,
50.696	and hated all sports.
55.561	But after one week of practicing,
58.322	my throws became more like this:
66.585	A bit better.
68.834	I thought, the yo-yo
68.834	is something for me to be good at.
72.768	For the first time in my life,
75.499	I found my passion.
78.856	I was spending all my time practicing.
81.849	It took me hours and hours a day
81.849	to build my skills up to the next level.
87.348	And then, four years later,
87.348	when I was 18 years old,
92.068	I was standing onstage
92.068	at the World YoYo Contest.
95.349	And I won.
96.879	I was so excited.
98.073	"""Yes, I did it! I became a hero."
100.676	I may get many sponsors, a lot of money,
103.044	tons of interviews,
103.044	"and be on TV!"" I thought."
105.854	(Laughter)
107.6	But after coming back to Japan,
110.844	totally nothing changed in my life.
113.872	(Laughter)
115.607	I realized society
115.607	didn't value my passion.
120.168	So I went back to my college
122.736	and became a typical Japanese worker
122.736	as a systems engineer.
127.244	I felt my passion,
127.244	heart and soul, had left my body.
133.575	I felt I was not alive anymore.
136.394	So I started to consider what I should do,
140.32	and I thought, I wanted to make
140.32	my performance better,
144.92	and to show onstage
144.92	how spectacular the yo-yo could be
149.374	to change the public's image of the yo-yo.
153.521	So I quit my company
156.409	and started a career
156.409	as a professional performer.
160.399	I started to learn classic ballet,
160.399	jazz dance, acrobatics and other things
165.078	to make my performance better.
167.52	As a result of these efforts,
167.52	and the help of many others,
170.696	it happened.
172.956	I won the World YoYo Contest again
172.956	in the artistic performance division.
177.458	I passed an audition for Cirque Du Soleil.
180.751	Today, I am standing on the TED stage
184.607	with the yo-yo in front of you.
187.19	(Applause)
191.543	What I learned from the yo-yo is,
194.833	if I make enough effort with huge passion,
199.698	there is no impossible.
202.096	Could you let me share my passion with you
204.992	through my performance?
206.647	(Applause)
