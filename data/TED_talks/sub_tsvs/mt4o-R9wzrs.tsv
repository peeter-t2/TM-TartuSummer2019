13.329	The shocking police crackdown
13.329	on protestors in Ferguson, Missouri,
17.717	in the wake of the police 
17.717	shooting of Michael Brown,
20.729	underscored the extent to which advanced
20.729	military weapons and equipment,
24.952	designed for the battlefield,
26.684	are making their way
27.993	to small-town police departments
27.993	across the United States.
32.514	Although much tougher to observe,
34.5	this same thing is happening 
34.5	with surveillance equipment.
38.047	NSA-style mass 
38.047	surveillance is enabling
40.707	local police departments 
40.707	to gather vast quantities
43.665	of sensitive information
43.665	about each and every one of us
47.232	in a way that was
47.232	never previously possible.
51.284	Location information can 
51.284	be very sensitive.
54.76	If you drive your car around
54.76	the United States,
57.391	it can reveal if you go 
57.391	to a therapist,
59.314	attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting,
61.782	if you go to church 
61.782	or if you don't go to church.
64.603	And when that 
64.603	information about you
66.329	is combined with the same information
66.329	about everyone else,
69.824	the government can gain 
69.824	a detailed portrait
72.398	of how private citizens interact.
75.114	This information used to be private.
77.589	Thanks to modern technology,
79.282	the government knows far too much
79.282	about what happens behind closed doors.
83.61	And local police departments make
83.61	decisions about who they think you are
87.998	based on this information.
91.169	One of the key technologies 
91.169	driving mass location tracking
95.816	is the innocuous-sounding
95.816	Automatic License Plate Reader.
98.774	If you haven't seen one,
100.469	it's probably because you didn't
100.469	know what to look for --
103.657	they're everywhere.
105.032	Mounted on roads or 
105.032	on police cars,
108.104	Automatic License Plate Readers
108.104	capture images of every passing car
112.533	and convert the license plate
112.533	into machine-readable text
116.158	so that they can be checked
116.158	against hot lists
119.56	of cars potentially wanted
119.56	for wrongdoing.
122.845	But more than that, increasingly,
124.972	local police departments 
124.972	are keeping records
127.122	not just of people wanted for wrongdoing,
130.282	but of every plate that 
130.282	passes them by,
133.084	resulting in the collection
133.084	of mass quantities of data
137.053	about where Americans have gone.
139.294	Did you know this
139.294	was happening?
141.822	When Mike Katz-Lacabe asked
141.822	his local police department
145.228	for information about the plate
145.228	reader data they had on him,
148.657	this is what they got:
150.335	in addition to the date, 
150.335	time and location,
153.477	the police department had 
153.477	photographs that captured
156.508	where he was going and 
156.508	often who he was with.
159.898	The second photo from the top
159.898	is a picture of Mike and his two daughters
163.72	getting out of their car
163.72	in their own driveway.
167.552	The government has 
167.552	hundreds of photos like this
170.34	about Mike going about his daily life.
173.111	And if you drive a car 
173.111	in the United States,
175.295	I would bet money 
175.295	that they have photographs
178.028	like this of you going
178.028	about your daily life.
180.946	Mike hasn't done anything wrong.
182.987	Why is it okay that the government
182.987	is keeping all of this information?
186.942	The reason it's happening is because,
188.721	as the cost of storing
188.721	this data has plummeted,
192.072	the police departments
192.072	simply hang on to it,
194.584	just in case it could be useful someday.
198.366	The issue is not just that
198.366	one police department
200.866	is gathering this information in isolation
203.487	or even that multiple police 
203.487	departments are doing it.
206.246	At the same time, the federal government
208.743	is collecting all of these
208.743	individual pots of data,
212.361	and pooling them together 
212.361	into one vast database
215.682	with hundreds of millions of hits,
217.338	showing where Americans have traveled.
219.806	This document from the 
219.806	Federal Drug Enforcement Administration,
222.964	which is one of the agencies
222.964	primarily interested in this,
225.729	is one of several that reveal 
225.729	the existence of this database.
230.166	Meanwhile, in New York City,
232.735	the NYPD has driven police cars
232.735	equipped with license plate readers
236.677	past mosques in order to
236.677	figure out who is attending.
240.851	The uses and abuses of this technology
240.851	aren't limited to the United States.
244.689	In the U.K., the police department
247.724	put 80-year-old John Kat
247.724	on a plate reader watch list
251.868	after he had attended dozens of
251.868	lawful political demonstrations
256.145	where he liked to sit on a bench
256.145	and sketch the attendees.
260.771	License plate readers aren't the
260.771	only mass location tracking technology
264.293	available to law enforcement agents today.
266.449	Through a technique known as
266.449	a cell tower dump,
269.461	law enforcement agents can
269.461	uncover who was using
272.713	one or more cell towers
272.713	at a particular time,
274.998	a technique which has been known to reveal
277.03	the location of tens of thousands
277.03	and even hundreds of thousands of people.
281.309	Also, using a device known as a StingRay,
284.549	law enforcement agents
284.549	can send tracking signals
287.185	inside people's houses
287.185	to identify the cell phones located there.
291.55	And if they don't know
291.55	which house to target,
293.812	they've been known 
293.812	to drive this technology
295.998	around through whole neighborhoods.
299.424	Just as the police in Ferguson possess
299.424	high-tech military weapons and equipment,
304.06	so too do police departments across
304.06	the United States
307.042	possess high-tech surveillance gear.
309.377	Just because you don't see it,
311.408	doesn't mean it's not there.
313.793	The question is, what should
313.793	we do about this?
316.344	I think this poses a serious
316.344	civil liberties threat.
319.654	History has shown that once the police 
319.654	have massive quantities of data,
324.016	tracking the movements of innocent people,
326.095	it gets abused, maybe for blackmail,
326.095	maybe for political advantage,
330.411	or maybe for simple voyeurism.
332.67	Fortunately, there are steps we can take.
335.012	Local police departments can 
335.012	be governed by the city councils,
338.742	which can pass laws requiring the police
341.664	to dispose of the data 
341.664	about innocent people
344.586	while allowing the legitimate
344.586	uses of the technology to go forward.
347.748	Thank you.
349.423	(Applause).
