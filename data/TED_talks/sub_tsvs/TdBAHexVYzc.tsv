13.303	A few years ago,
14.487	with my colleague, Emmanuelle Charpentier,
17.281	I invented a new technology
17.281	for editing genomes.
21.093	It's called CRISPR-Cas9.
23.87	The CRISPR technology allows
23.87	scientists to make changes
27.47	to the DNA in cells
29.349	that could allow us
29.349	to cure genetic disease.
33.196	You might be interested to know
34.712	that the CRISPR technology came about
34.712	through a basic research project
38.52	that was aimed at discovering
38.52	how bacteria fight viral infections.
43.34	Bacteria have to deal with viruses
43.34	in their environment,
46.236	and we can think about a viral infection
46.236	like a ticking time bomb --
49.924	a bacterium has only a few minutes
49.924	to defuse the bomb
53.306	before it gets destroyed.
55.284	So, many bacteria have in their cells
55.284	an adaptive immune system called CRISPR,
60.698	that allows them to detect
60.698	viral DNA and destroy it.
65.148	Part of the CRISPR system
65.148	is a protein called Cas9,
69.14	that's able to seek out, cut
69.14	and eventually degrade viral DNA
75.113	in a specific way.
77.054	And it was through our research
78.58	to understand the activity
78.58	of this protein, Cas9,
82.261	that we realized that we could
82.261	harness its function
85.116	as a genetic engineering technology --
88.546	a way for scientists to delete or insert
88.546	specific bits of DNA into cells
95.521	with incredible precision --
97.576	that would offer opportunities
99.267	to do things that really haven't
99.267	been possible in the past.
103.184	The CRISPR technology
103.184	has already been used
105.27	to change the DNA in the cells
105.27	of mice and monkeys,
110.378	other organisms as well.
112.527	Chinese scientists showed recently
114.306	that they could even use
114.306	the CRISPR technology
116.489	to change genes in human embryos.
119.142	And scientists in Philadelphia showed
119.142	they could use CRISPR
122.309	to remove the DNA
122.309	of an integrated HIV virus
127.176	from infected human cells.
130.217	The opportunity to do this kind
130.217	of genome editing
133.372	also raises various ethical issues
133.372	that we have to consider,
136.679	because this technology can be employed
136.679	not only in adult cells,
140.671	but also in the embryos of organisms,
143.298	including our own species.
146.767	And so, together with my colleagues,
148.789	I've called for a global conversation
148.789	about the technology that I co-invented,
153.301	so that we can consider all of the ethical
153.301	and societal implications
157.865	of a technology like this.
160.056	What I want to do now is tell you
160.056	what the CRISPR technology is,
165.019	what it can do,
166.497	where we are today
167.766	and why I think we need to take
167.766	a prudent path forward
170.812	in the way that we employ this technology.
175.085	When viruses infect a cell,
175.085	they inject their DNA.
179.363	And in a bacterium,
180.863	the CRISPR system allows that DNA
180.863	to be plucked out of the virus,
185.752	and inserted in little bits
185.752	into the chromosome --
189.621	the DNA of the bacterium.
191.937	And these integrated bits of viral DNA
191.937	get inserted at a site called CRISPR.
198.032	CRISPR stands for clustered regularly
198.032	interspaced short palindromic repeats.
204.051	(Laughter)
205.076	A big mouthful -- you can see why
205.076	we use the acronym CRISPR.
208.89	It's a mechanism that allows cells
208.89	to record, over time,
212.902	the viruses they have been exposed to.
215.608	And importantly, those bits of DNA
215.608	are passed on to the cells' progeny,
220.315	so cells are protected from viruses
220.315	not only in one generation,
224.872	but over many generations of cells.
227.245	This allows the cells
227.245	to keep a record of infection,
231.554	and as my colleague,
231.554	Blake Wiedenheft, likes to say,
234.517	the CRISPR locus is effectively
234.517	a genetic vaccination card in cells.
240.572	Once those bits of DNA have been inserted
240.572	into the bacterial chromosome,
245.094	the cell then makes a little copy
245.094	of a molecule called RNA,
249.317	which is orange in this picture,
251.356	that is an exact replicate
251.356	of the viral DNA.
256.502	RNA is a chemical cousin of DNA,
258.862	and it allows interaction
258.862	with DNA molecules
262.839	that have a matching sequence.
265.258	So those little bits of RNA
265.258	from the CRISPR locus
269.191	associate -- they bind --
269.191	to protein called Cas9,
273.004	which is white in the picture,
274.963	and form a complex that functions
274.963	like a sentinel in the cell.
279.206	It searches through all
279.206	of the DNA in the cell,
282.644	to find sites that match
282.644	the sequences in the bound RNAs.
286.92	And when those sites are found --
288.579	as you can see here,
288.579	the blue molecule is DNA --
292.073	this complex associates with that DNA
294.946	and allows the Cas9 cleaver
294.946	to cut up the viral DNA.
300.272	It makes a very precise break.
304.096	So we can think of the Cas9 RNA
304.096	sentinel complex
308.52	like a pair of scissors
308.52	that can cut DNA --
311.725	it makes a double-stranded break
311.725	in the DNA helix.
314.985	And importantly,
314.985	this complex is programmable,
318.991	so it can be programmed to recognize
318.991	particular DNA sequences,
324.215	and make a break in the DNA at that site.
327.928	As I'm going to tell you now,
329.532	we recognized that that activity
329.532	could be harnessed for genome engineering,
334.332	to allow cells to make
334.332	a very precise change to the DNA
338.583	at the site where
338.583	this break was introduced.
341.558	That's sort of analogous
342.797	to the way that we use
342.797	a word-processing program
345.529	to fix a typo in a document.
349.541	The reason we envisioned using
349.541	the CRISPR system for genome engineering
354.383	is because cells have the ability
354.383	to detect broken DNA
358.026	and repair it.
359.78	So when a plant or an animal cell detects
359.78	a double-stranded break in its DNA,
364.735	it can fix that break,
366.356	either by pasting together
366.356	the ends of the broken DNA
369.907	with a little, tiny change
369.907	in the sequence of that position,
374.041	or it can repair the break by integrating
374.041	a new piece of DNA at the site of the cut.
381.054	So if we have a way to introduce
381.054	double-stranded breaks into DNA
386.051	at precise places,
387.655	we can trigger cells
387.655	to repair those breaks,
390.488	by either the disruption or incorporation
390.488	of new genetic information.
395.936	So if we were able to program
395.936	the CRISPR technology
399.202	to make a break in DNA
401.549	at the position at or near a mutation
401.549	causing cystic fibrosis, for example,
407.842	we could trigger cells
407.842	to repair that mutation.
412.464	Genome engineering is actually not new,
412.464	it's been in development since the 1970s.
417.591	We've had technologies for sequencing DNA,
420.366	for copying DNA,
421.985	and even for manipulating DNA.
424.969	And these technologies
424.969	were very promising,
428.129	but the problem was
428.129	that they were either inefficient,
432.559	or they were difficult enough to use
434.916	that most scientists had not adopted them
434.916	for use in their own laboratories,
439.742	or certainly for many
439.742	clinical applications.
444.722	So, the opportunity to take a technology
444.722	like CRISPR and utilize it has appeal,
452.101	because of its relative simplicity.
455.126	We can think of older
455.126	genome engineering technologies
458.919	as similar to having
458.919	to rewire your computer
462.602	each time you want to run
462.602	a new piece of software,
466.396	whereas the CRISPR technology
466.396	is like software for the genome,
470.184	we can program it easily,
470.184	using these little bits of RNA.
474.658	So once a double-stranded
474.658	break is made in DNA,
477.775	we can induce repair,
479.886	and thereby potentially achieve
479.886	astounding things,
483.356	like being able to correct mutations
483.356	that cause sickle cell anemia
487.539	or cause Huntington's Disease.
489.914	I actually think that the first
489.914	applications of the CRISPR technology
493.399	are going to happen in the blood,
495.692	where it's relatively easier
495.692	to deliver this tool into cells,
500.469	compared to solid tissues.
503.905	Right now, a lot of the work
503.905	that's going on
506.333	applies to animal models
506.333	of human disease, such as mice.
510.326	The technology is being used to make
510.326	very precise changes
513.619	that allow us to study the way
513.619	that these changes in the cell's DNA
518.814	affect either a tissue or,
518.814	in this case, an entire organism.
523.515	Now in this example,
524.746	the CRISPR technology
524.746	was used to disrupt a gene
528.563	by making a tiny change in the DNA
531.354	in a gene that is responsible
531.354	for the black coat color of these mice.
536.219	Imagine that these white mice
536.219	differ from their pigmented litter-mates
541.261	by just a tiny change at one gene
541.261	in the entire genome,
545.952	and they're otherwise completely normal.
547.966	And when we sequence the DNA
547.966	from these animals,
550.881	we find that the change in the DNA
553.531	has occurred at exactly the place
553.531	where we induced it,
556.697	using the CRISPR technology.
559.662	Additional experiments
559.662	are going on in other animals
562.41	that are useful for creating models
562.41	for human disease,
566.529	such as monkeys.
568.156	And here we find
568.156	that we can use these systems
571.406	to test the application of this technology
571.406	in particular tissues,
575.232	for example, figuring out how to deliver
575.232	the CRISPR tool into cells.
580.329	We also want to understand better
582.501	how to control the way
582.501	that DNA is repaired after it's cut,
586.152	and also to figure out how to control
586.152	and limit any kind of off-target,
591.857	or unintended effects
591.857	of using the technology.
596.356	I think that we will see
596.356	clinical application of this technology,
602.53	certainly in adults,
604.066	within the next 10 years.
605.693	I think that it's likely
605.693	that we will see clinical trials
608.851	and possibly even approved
608.851	therapies within that time,
612.304	which is a very exciting thing
612.304	to think about.
615.041	And because of the excitement
615.041	around this technology,
617.566	there's a lot of interest
617.566	in start-up companies
620.883	that have been founded
620.883	to commercialize the CRISPR technology,
625.669	and lots of venture capitalists
627.182	that have been investing
627.182	in these companies.
631.242	But we have to also consider
632.839	that the CRISPR technology can be used
632.839	for things like enhancement.
636.485	Imagine that we could try
636.485	to engineer humans
639.553	that have enhanced properties,
639.553	such as stronger bones,
644.012	or less susceptibility
644.012	to cardiovascular disease
648.107	or even to have properties
649.642	that we would consider maybe
649.642	to be desirable,
652.065	like a different eye color
652.065	or to be taller, things like that.
657.942	"""Designer humans,"" if you will."
660.78	Right now, the genetic information
663.194	to understand what types of genes
663.194	would give rise to these traits
667.711	is mostly not known.
669.468	But it's important to know
670.738	that the CRISPR technology gives us a tool
670.738	to make such changes,
675.047	once that knowledge becomes available.
678.651	This raises a number of ethical questions
678.651	that we have to carefully consider,
682.786	and this is why I and my colleagues
682.786	have called for a global pause
687.025	in any clinical application
687.025	of the CRISPR technology in human embryos,
691.795	to give us time
692.97	to really consider all of the various
692.97	implications of doing so.
697.743	And actually, there is an important
697.743	precedent for such a pause
701.61	from the 1970s,
702.953	when scientists got together
704.841	to call for a moratorium
704.841	on the use of molecular cloning,
708.695	until the safety of that technology
708.695	could be tested carefully and validated.
715.506	So, genome-engineered humans
715.506	are not with us yet,
720.67	but this is no longer science fiction.
724.179	Genome-engineered animals and plants
724.179	are happening right now.
729.069	And this puts in front of all of us
729.069	a huge responsibility,
733.146	to consider carefully
733.146	both the unintended consequences
737.747	as well as the intended impacts
737.747	of a scientific breakthrough.
742.19	Thank you.
743.366	(Applause)
751.572	(Applause ends)
753.535	Bruno Giussani: Jennifer, this is
753.535	a technology with huge consequences,
757.453	as you pointed out.
758.628	Your attitude about asking for a pause
758.628	or a moratorium or a quarantine
763.824	is incredibly responsible.
766.733	There are, of course,
766.733	the therapeutic results of this,
769.305	but then there are the un-therapeutic ones
771.479	and they seem to be the ones
771.479	gaining traction,
773.683	particularly in the media.
774.953	This is one of the latest issues
774.953	"of The Economist -- ""Editing humanity."""
779.143	It's all about genetic enhancement,
779.143	it's not about therapeutics.
783.541	What kind of reactions
783.541	did you get back in March
785.847	from your colleagues in the science world,
787.888	when you asked or suggested
789.27	that we should actually pause this
789.27	for a moment and think about it?
793.054	Jennifer Doudna: My colleagues
793.054	were actually, I think, delighted
796.079	to have the opportunity
796.079	to discuss this openly.
798.348	It's interesting that as I talk to people,
800.718	my scientific colleagues
800.718	as well as others,
803.21	there's a wide variety
803.21	of viewpoints about this.
805.544	So clearly it's a topic that needs
805.544	careful consideration and discussion.
809.242	BG: There's a big meeting
809.242	happening in December
811.481	that you and your colleagues are calling,
813.481	together with the National Academy
813.481	of Sciences and others,
816.272	what do you hope will come
816.272	out of the meeting, practically?
819.588	JD: Well, I hope that we can air the views
821.978	of many different individuals
821.978	and stakeholders
825.602	who want to think about how to use
825.602	this technology responsibly.
829.918	It may not be possible to come up with
829.918	a consensus point of view,
833.044	but I think we should at least understand
835.061	what all the issues are as we go forward.
837.057	BG: Now, colleagues of yours,
838.487	like George Church,
838.487	for example, at Harvard,
840.59	"they say, ""Yeah, ethical issues basically"
840.59	are just a question of safety.
844.05	We test and test and test again,
844.05	in animals and in labs,
846.728	and then once we feel it's safe enough,
846.728	"we move on to humans."""
850.668	So that's kind of the other
850.668	school of thought,
853.273	that we should actually use
853.273	this opportunity and really go for it.
856.445	Is there a possible split happening
856.445	in the science community about this?
860.247	I mean, are we going to see
860.247	some people holding back
862.731	because they have ethical concerns,
864.549	and some others just going forward
866.26	because some countries under-regulate
866.26	or don't regulate at all?
869.58	JD: Well, I think with any new technology,
869.58	especially something like this,
873.449	there are going to be
873.449	a variety of viewpoints,
876.258	and I think that's
876.258	perfectly understandable.
879.623	I think that in the end,
881.159	this technology will be used
881.159	for human genome engineering,
886.134	but I think to do that without careful
886.134	consideration and discussion
890.475	of the risks and potential complications
893.436	would not be responsible.
894.999	BG: There are a lot of technologies
894.999	and other fields of science
898.002	that are developing exponentially,
898.002	pretty much like yours.
900.797	I'm thinking about artificial
900.797	intelligence, autonomous robots and so on.
905.199	No one seems --
906.39	aside from autonomous warfare robots --
908.922	nobody seems to have launched
908.922	a similar discussion in those fields,
913.651	in calling for a moratorium.
915.085	Do you think that your discussion may
915.085	serve as a blueprint for other fields?
919.18	JD: Well, I think it's hard for scientists
919.18	to get out of the laboratory.
922.723	Speaking for myself,
923.9	it's a little bit
923.9	uncomfortable to do that.
926.54	But I do think that being involved
926.54	in the genesis of this
930.478	really puts me and my colleagues
930.478	in a position of responsibility.
934.358	And I would say that I certainly hope
934.358	that other technologies
937.812	will be considered in the same way,
940.482	just as we would want to consider
940.482	something that could have implications
943.904	in other fields besides biology.
945.855	BG: Jennifer, thanks for coming to TED.
947.831	JD: Thank you.
949.116	(Applause)
