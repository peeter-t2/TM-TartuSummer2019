18.33	My name is Joseph,
18.33	a Member of Parliament in Kenya.
21.33	Picture a Maasai village,
23.329	and one evening,
24.909	government soldiers come,
24.909	surround the village
27.33	and ask each elder to bring
27.33	one boy to school.
29.545	That's how I went to school --
31.33	pretty much a government guy
31.33	pointing a gun
33.354	and told my father,
33.354	"""You have to make a choice."""
35.617	I walked very comfortably
35.617	to this missionary school,
38.33	that was run by an American missionary.
40.33	The first thing the American missionary
40.33	gave me was a candy.
43.33	I had never in my life ever tasted candy.
45.33	So I said to myself,
45.33	with all these hundred other boys,
47.974	this is where I belong.
49.36	(Laughter) I stayed.
51.186	When everybody else was dropping out.
53.33	My family moved; we're nomads.
55.075	It was a boarding school, I was seven --
57.052	Every time it closed
57.052	you had to travel to find them.
61.33	You slept in the bush, but you kept going.
63.849	And I stayed. I don't know why, but I did.
66.33	All of a sudden I passed
66.33	the national examination,
70.33	found myself in a very beautiful
70.33	high school in Kenya.
73.33	And I finished high school.
75.238	And just walking, I found a man
77.08	who gave me a full scholarship
77.08	to the United States.
79.947	My mother still lived in a cow-dung hut,
81.989	none of my brothers were going to school,
84.036	"and this man told me, ""Here, go."""
86.33	I got a scholarship
87.389	to St. Lawrence University,
87.389	Upstate New York;
90.053	finished that.
91.655	And after that I went
91.655	to Harvard Graduate School;
95.33	finished that.
97.004	Then I worked in DC a little bit:
98.751	I wrote a book for National Geographic
98.751	and taught U.S. history.
101.837	And every time, I kept going back home,
104.487	listening to their problems --
105.98	sick people, people
105.98	with no water, all this stuff --
108.55	every time I go back to America,
110.494	I kept thinking about them.
111.97	Then one day, an elder gave me
111.97	a story that went like this:
115.695	long time ago, there was a big war
115.695	between tribes.
119.854	This specific tribe was really afraid
119.854	of this other Luhya tribe.
123.33	Every time, they sent scouts
123.33	to make sure no one attacked them.
126.894	So one day, the scouts came running
126.894	and told the villagers,
129.882	"""The enemies are coming."
129.882	"Only half an hour away, they'll be here."""
133.083	So people scrambled, took their things
133.083	and ready to go, move out.
136.909	But there were two men:
138.66	one man was blind, one man had no legs
141.152	-- he was born like that.
142.481	"The leader of the chiefs said, ""No, sorry."
142.481	We can't take you. You'll slow us down.
146.402	We have to flee our women
146.402	"and children, we have to run."""
150.648	And they were left behind, waiting to die.
153.33	But these two people worked something out.
156.33	"The blind man said, ""Look,"
156.33	"I'm a very strong man but I can't see."""
159.497	The man with no legs says,
159.497	"""I can see as far as the end of the world,"
162.807	but I can't save myself
162.807	"from a cat, or whatever animals."""
167.925	The blind man went down
167.925	on his knees like this,
171.33	and told the man with no legs
171.33	to go over his back, and stood up.
174.71	The man on top can see,
174.71	the blind man can walk.
178.121	These guys took off, followed
178.121	the footsteps of the villagers
181.002	until they found and passed them.
185.33	So, this was told to me
185.33	in a setup of elders.
189.33	And it's a really poor area.
191.049	I represent Northern Kenya:
192.529	the most nomadic, remote areas
192.529	you can even find.
196.33	"And that man told me, ""So, here you are."
198.33	You've got a good education from America,
198.33	you have a good life in America;
202.298	what are you going to do for us?
205.417	We want you to be our eyes,
205.417	we'll give you the legs.
208.33	"We'll walk you, you lead us."""
210.742	The opportunity came.
210.742	I was always thinking about that:
213.376	"""What can I do to help my people?"
215.33	Every time you go to an area
215.33	where for 43 years of independence,
218.701	we still don't have
218.701	basic health facilities.
221.267	A man has to be transported
221.267	in a wheelbarrow 30 km for a hospital.
224.418	No clean drinking water.
226.03	"So I said, ""I'm going to dedicate myself."
228.33	I'm leaving America.
229.901	"I'm going to run for office."""
231.734	Last June, I moved from America,
235.559	ran in July election and won.
238.933	And I came for them,
242.457	and that's my goal.
243.608	Right now I have in place,
243.608	for the last nine months,
247.155	a plan that in five years,
250.37	every nomad will have
250.37	clean drinking water.
253.774	We're building dispensaries
253.774	across that constituency.
257.82	I'm asking my friends from America to help
260.074	with bringing nurses
260.074	or doctors to help us out.
262.621	I'm trying to improve infrastructure.
265.266	I'm using the knowledge
265.266	I received from the United States
268.006	and from my community
269.658	to move them forward.
271.083	I'm trying to develop
271.083	homegrown solutions to our issues
274.565	because people from outside
274.565	can come and help us,
277.155	but if we don't help ourselves,
277.155	there's nothing to do.
280.258	My plan right now
281.37	as I continue with introducing
281.37	students to different fields --
285.33	some become doctors, some lawyers --
287.204	we want to produce
287.204	a comprehensive group of people,
289.624	students who can come back
289.624	and help us see a community grow
292.504	that is in the middle
292.504	of a huge economic recession.
296.147	As I continue to be
296.147	a Member of Parliament
298.964	and as I continue listening
298.964	to all of you talking about botany,
302.354	health, democracy, new inventions,
305.809	I'm hoping that one day
305.809	in my own little community --
308.33	which is 26,000 square km,
310.33	maybe five times Rhode Island --
312.491	with no roads,
313.98	we'll be able to become a model
313.98	to help others develop.
317.933	Thank you very much.
319.318	(Applause)
