12.662	I want to speak about 
12.662	a forgotten conflict.
15.474	It's a conflict that rarely
15.474	hits the headlines.
19.18	It happens right here,
19.18	in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
24.244	Now, most people outside of Africa
24.244	don't know much about the war in Congo,
28.842	so let me give you a couple of key facts.
32.099	The Congolese conflict is the deadliest 
32.099	conflict since World War II.
37.687	It has caused almost four million deaths.
40.987	It has destabilized most of Central Africa
40.987	for the past 18 years.
45.581	It is the largest ongoing
45.581	humanitarian crisis in the world.
50.501	That's why I first went to Congo in 2001.
54.162	I was a young humanitarian aid worker,
54.162	and I met this woman who was my age.
59.294	She was called Isabelle.
62.868	Local militias
62.868	had attacked Isabelle's village.
66.179	They had killed many men,
66.179	raped many women.
69.227	They had looted everything.
71.224	And then they wanted to take Isabelle,
73.847	but her husband stepped in,
75.224	"and he said, ""No,"
75.224	please don't take Isabelle.
78.422	"Take me instead."""
81.709	So he had gone to the forest
81.709	with the militias,
84.7	and Isabelle had never seen him again.
88.871	Well, it's because of people
88.871	like Isabelle and her husband
92.841	that I have devoted my career
92.841	to studying this war
95.86	that we know so little about.
98.638	Although there is one story
98.638	about Congo that you may have heard.
103.262	It's a story about minerals and rape.
107.214	Policy statements and media reports
109.8	both usually focus on a primary cause
109.8	of violence in Congo --
114.534	the illegal exploitation and trafficking
114.534	of natural resources --
119.312	and on a main consequence --
122.049	sexual abuse of women and girls
122.049	as a weapon of war.
127.243	So, not that these two issues
127.243	aren't important and tragic. They are.
134.08	But today I want to tell you 
134.08	a different story.
137.978	I want to tell you a story
137.978	that emphasizes a core cause
141.596	of the ongoing conflict.
144.283	Violence in Congo is in large part driven
144.283	by local bottom-up conflicts
151.4	that international peace efforts
151.4	have failed to help address.
157.325	The story starts from the fact
157.325	that not only is Congo notable
162.568	for being the world's worst
162.568	ongoing humanitarian crisis,
166.885	but it is also home to some of the largest
170.411	international peacebuilding
170.411	efforts in the world.
174.572	Congo hosts the largest
176.685	and most expensive United Nations
176.685	peacekeeping mission in the world.
181.53	It was also the site of the first
181.53	European-led peacekeeping mission,
186.229	and for its first cases ever,
188.903	the International Criminal Court
188.903	chose to prosecute Congolese warlords.
195.535	In 2006, when Congo held the first 
195.535	free national elections in its history,
202.035	many observers thought that an end to 
202.035	violence in the region had finally come.
208.171	The international community lauded the 
208.171	successful organization of these elections
214.3	as finally an example
214.3	of successful international intervention
218.637	in a failed state.
221.095	But the eastern provinces
222.853	have continued to face
222.853	massive population displacements
226.26	and horrific human rights violations.
229.833	Shortly before I went
229.833	back there last summer,
232.318	there was a horrible massacre
232.318	in the province of South Kivu.
237.217	Thirty-three people were killed.
239.245	They were mostly women and children,
241.977	and many of them were hacked to death.
246.116	During the past eight years,
248.069	fighting in the eastern provinces
248.069	has regularly reignited
252.007	full-scale civil and international war.
255.074	So basically, every time we feel
255.074	that we are on the brink of peace,
260.055	the conflict explodes again.
262.897	Why?
264.615	Why have the massive international efforts
267.587	failed to help Congo 
267.587	achieve lasting peace and security?
274.096	Well, my answer to this question
274.096	revolves around two central observations.
281.064	First, one of the main reasons
281.064	for the continuation of violence in Congo
287.097	is fundamentally local --
290.005	and when I say local,
291.292	I really mean at the level
291.292	of the individual, the family,
294.823	the clan, the municipality,
294.823	the community, the district,
298.712	sometimes the ethnic group.
301.951	For instance, you remember the story
301.951	of Isabelle that I told you.
306.479	Well, the reason why militias
306.479	had attacked Isabelle's village
310.683	was because they wanted to take the land
313.793	that the villagers needed
313.793	to cultivate food and to survive.
318.508	The second central observation
318.508	is that international peace efforts
323.278	have failed to help
323.278	address local conflicts
327.242	because of the presence
327.242	of a dominant peacebuilding culture.
332.161	So what I mean is that
335.777	Western and African diplomats,
338.15	United Nations peacekeepers, donors,
340.997	the staff of most
340.997	nongovernmental organizations
343.601	that work with the resolution of conflict,
346.437	they all share a specific way
346.437	of seeing the world.
351.215	And I was one of these people,
351.215	and I shared this culture,
355.221	so I know all too well how powerful it is.
359.213	Throughout the world,
359.213	and throughout conflict zones,
363.482	this common culture shapes
363.482	the intervener's understanding
367.29	of the causes of violence
369.774	as something that is primarily located
369.774	in the national and international spheres.
376.517	It shapes our understanding
376.517	of the path toward peace
379.908	as something again that requires
379.908	top-down intervention
383.756	to address national
383.756	and international tensions.
387.879	And it shapes our understanding
387.879	of the roles of foreign actors
391.598	as engaging in national
391.598	and international peace processes.
397.159	Even more importantly,
397.159	this common culture
401.034	enables international peacebuilders
401.034	to ignore the micro-level tensions
407.234	that often jeopardize
407.234	the macro-level settlements.
412.48	So for instance, in Congo,
414.581	because of how they are
414.581	socialized and trained,
418.795	United Nations officials,
418.795	donors, diplomats,
421.181	the staff of most
421.181	nongovernmental organizations,
424.34	they interpret continued fighting
424.34	and massacres as a top-down problem.
431.35	To them, the violence they see
433.574	is the consequence of tensions
433.574	between President Kabila
438.554	and various national opponents,
441.224	and tensions between Congo,
441.224	Rwanda and Uganda.
446.217	In addition, these international 
446.217	peacebuilders view local conflicts
452.288	as simply the result
452.288	of national and international tensions,
458.081	insufficient state authority,
460.496	and what they call the Congolese people's
460.496	so-called inherent penchant for violence.
467.364	The dominant culture
467.364	also constructs intervention
471.316	at the national and international levels
474.149	as the only natural and legitimate task
474.149	for United Nations staffers and diplomats.
481.362	And it elevates the organization
481.362	of general elections,
485.721	which is now a sort of cure-all,
487.807	as the most crucial state
487.807	reconstruction mechanism
491.591	over more effective
491.591	state-building approaches.
495.116	And that happens not only in Congo
495.116	but also in many other conflict zones.
501.343	But let's dig deeper,
503.243	into the other main sources of violence.
507.193	In Congo, continuing violence
509.862	is motivated not only by the national
509.862	and international causes
514.875	but also by longstanding
514.875	bottom-up agendas
519.182	whose main instigators
519.182	are villagers, traditional chiefs,
523.143	community chiefs or ethnic leaders.
526.141	Many conflicts revolve around political,
526.141	social and economic stakes
532.116	that are distinctively local.
534.944	For instance, there is
534.944	a lot of competition
537.92	at the village or district level
540.308	over who can be chief of village
540.308	or chief of territory
543.894	according to traditional law,
546.468	and who can control
546.468	the distribution of land
549.696	and the exploitation
549.696	of local mining sites.
553.215	This competition often results
553.215	in localized fighting,
557.436	for instance in one village or territory,
561.22	and quite frequently,
561.22	it escalates into generalized fighting,
565.163	so across a whole province,
567.292	and even at times
567.292	into neighboring countries.
570.631	Take the conflict between Congolese 
570.631	of Rwandan descent
575.698	and the so-called indigenous 
575.698	communities of the Kivus.
580.609	This conflict started in the 1930s
580.609	during Belgian colonization,
585.995	when both communities competed
585.995	over access to land and to local power.
591.328	Then, in 1960,
591.328	after Congolese independence,
594.727	it escalated because each camp
594.727	tried to align with national politicians,
600.578	but still to advance their local agendas.
604.512	And then, at the time
604.512	of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda,
608.88	these local actors allied
608.88	with Congolese and Rwandan armed groups,
615.059	but still to advance their local agendas
615.059	in the provinces of the Kivus.
620.389	And since then, these local disputes
620.389	over land and local power
626.023	have fueled violence,
627.743	and they have regularly jeopardized
629.989	the national and
629.989	international settlements.
635.542	So we can wonder why
635.542	in these circumstances
639.347	the international peacebuilders
639.347	have failed to help implement
644.029	local peacebuilding programs.
647.407	And the answer is that
647.407	international interveners
652.253	deem the resolution of grassroots conflict
655.776	an unimportant, unfamiliar,
655.776	and illegitimate task.
662.41	The very idea of becoming involved
662.41	at the local level clashes fundamentally
668.389	with existing cultural norms,
670.497	and it threatens
670.497	key organizational interests.
674.38	For instance, the very identity
674.38	of the United Nations
678.997	as this macro-level
678.997	diplomatic organization
682.353	would be upended
682.353	if it were to refocus on local conflicts.
688.761	And the result is that
688.761	neither the internal resistance
693.486	to the dominant ways of working
695.833	nor the external shocks
698.576	have managed to convince international
698.576	actors that they should reevaluate
703.018	their understanding
703.018	of violence and intervention.
707.56	And so far, there have been
707.56	only very few exceptions.
711.333	There have been exceptions,
711.333	but only very few exceptions,
714.796	to this broad pattern.
718.214	So to wrap up,
718.214	the story I just told you
721.526	is a story about how
721.526	a dominant peacebuilding culture
726.475	shapes the intervener's understanding
726.475	of what the causes of violence are,
731.282	how peace is made,
732.963	and what interventions should accomplish.
736.575	These understandings enable
736.575	international peacebuilders
740.324	to ignore the micro-level foundations
743.402	that are so necessary
743.402	for sustainable peace.
748.051	The resulting inattention
748.051	to local conflicts
751.044	leads to inadequate peacebuilding
751.044	in the short term
755.062	and potential war resumption
755.062	in the long term.
759.068	And what's fascinating
759.068	is that this analysis
762.214	helps us to better understand
762.214	many cases of lasting conflict
766.224	and international intervention failures,
766.224	in Africa and elsewhere.
771.513	Local conflicts fuel violence
771.513	in most war and post-war environments,
777.074	from Afghanistan to Sudan
777.074	to Timor-Leste,
780.765	and in the rare cases
780.765	where there have been comprehensive,
784.366	bottom-up peacebuilding initiatives,
787.453	these attempts have been successful
787.453	at making peace sustainable.
792.947	One of the best examples is the contrast
795.757	between the relatively peaceful
795.757	situation in Somaliland,
800.168	which benefited from sustained
800.168	grassroots peacebuilding initiatives,
805.378	and the violence prevalent
805.378	in the rest of Somalia,
809.586	where peacebuilding
809.586	has been mostly top-down.
812.945	And there are several other cases
815.246	in which local, grassroots
815.246	conflict resolution
818.961	has made a crucial difference.
821.98	So if we want international
821.98	peacebuilding to work,
826.052	in addition to any top-down intervention,
829.874	conflicts must be resolved
829.874	from the bottom up.
833.545	And again, it's not that national
833.545	and international tensions don't matter.
838.197	They do.
839.923	And it's not that national
839.923	and international peacebuilding
843.155	isn't necessary.
844.617	It is.
846	Instead, it is that both macro-level
846	and micro-level peacebuilding are needed
853.255	to make peace sustainable,
855.972	and local nongovernmental organizations,
858.113	local authorities and 
858.113	civil society representatives
861.092	should be the main actors
861.092	in the bottom-up process.
865.702	So of course, there are obstacles.
868.131	Local actors often lack the funding
870.786	and sometimes the logistical means
870.786	and the technical capacity
874.323	to implement effective,
874.323	local peacebuilding programs.
878.857	So international actors
878.857	should expand their funding and support
883.913	for local conflict resolution.
887.7	As for Congo, what can be done?
891.056	After two decades of conflict
891.056	and the deaths of millions,
894.78	it's clear that we need
894.78	to change our approach.
898.545	Based on my field research,
900.223	I believe that international
900.223	and Congolese actors
903.733	should pay more attention
903.733	to the resolution of land conflict
907.159	and the promotion
907.159	of inter-community reconciliation.
911.679	So for instance,
911.679	in the province of the Kivus,
914.321	the Life and Peace Institute
914.321	and its Congolese partners
917.589	have set up inter-community forums
920.684	to discuss the specifics
920.684	of local conflicts over land,
925.036	and these forums have found solutions
925.036	to help manage the violence.
930.671	That's the kind of program
930.671	that is sorely needed
934.29	throughout eastern Congo.
937.097	It's with programs like this
938.975	that we can help people
938.975	like Isabelle and her husband.
943.925	So these will not be magic wands,
946.448	but because they take into account
946.448	deeply rooted causes of the violence,
952.116	they could definitely be game-changers.
954.95	Thank you.
957.504	(Applause)
