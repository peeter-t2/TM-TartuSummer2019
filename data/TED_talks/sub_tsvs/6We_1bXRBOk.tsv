12.528	What would be a good end of life?
16.116	And I'm talking about the very end.
18.106	I'm talking about dying.
21.839	We all think a lot about how to live well.
25.596	I'd like to talk about increasing our chances of dying well.
30.028	I'm not a geriatrician.
32.148	I design reading programs for preschoolers.
34.852	What I know about this topic
36.678	comes from a qualitative study with a sample size of two.
41.08	In the last few years, I helped two friends
43.785	have the end of life they wanted.
46.026	Jim and Shirley Modini spent their 68 years of marriage
49.354	living off the grid on their 1,700-acre ranch
52.328	in the mountains of Sonoma County.
54.419	They kept just enough livestock to make ends meet
58.343	so that the majority of their ranch would remain a refuge
61.65	for the bears and lions and so many other things
63.883	that lived there.
65.49	This was their dream.
67.503	I met Jim and Shirley in their 80s.
70.786	They were both only children who chose not to have kids.
74.267	As we became friends, I became their trustee
76.846	and their medical advocate,
78.675	but more importantly, I became
80.683	the person who managed their end-of-life experiences.
84.442	And we learned a few things about how to have a good end.
88.115	In their final years, Jim and Shirley
90.086	faced cancers, fractures, infections, neurological illness.
94.086	It's true.
95.159	At the end, our bodily functions
97.396	and independence are declining to zero.
100.177	What we found is that, with a plan and the right people,
103.331	quality of life can remain high.
106.885	The beginning of the end is triggered
108.324	by a mortality awareness event, and during this time,
111.215	Jim and Shirley chose ACR nature preserves
115.453	to take their ranch over when they were gone.
117.985	This gave them the peace of mind to move forward.
121.565	It might be a diagnosis. It might be your intuition.
125.041	"But one day, you're going to say, ""This thing is going to get me."""
128.257	Jim and Shirley spent this time
129.813	letting friends know that their end was near
131.816	and that they were okay with that.
136.872	Dying from cancer and dying from neurological illness
139.721	are different.
141.292	In both cases, last days are about quiet reassurance.
145.594	Jim died first. He was conscious until the very end,
149.353	but on his last day he couldn't talk.
151.54	Through his eyes, we knew when he needed to hear again,
153.653	"""It is all set, Jim. We're going to take care of Shirley"
156.489	right here at the ranch,
157.658	"and ACR's going to take care of your wildlife forever."""
161.487	From this experience I'm going to share five practices.
164.179	I've put worksheets online,
165.994	so if you'd like, you can plan your own end.
168.777	It starts with a plan.
171.244	"Most people say, ""I'd like to die at home."""
173.761	Eighty percent of Americans die in a hospital
175.986	or a nursing home.
177.49	Saying we'd like to die at home is not a plan.
181.145	"A lot of people say, ""If I get like that, just shoot me."""
184.362	This is not a plan either; this is illegal.
186.858	(Laughter)
190.912	A plan involves answering
193.739	straightforward questions about the end you want.
196.097	Where do you want to be when you're no longer independent?
198.794	What do you want in terms of medical intervention?
201.691	And who's going to make sure your plan is followed?
204.065	You will need advocates.
205.542	Having more than one increases your chance
207.173	of getting the end you want.
208.933	Don't assume the natural choice is your spouse or child.
211.513	You want someone who has the time and proximity
213.838	to do this job well, and you want someone
216.429	who can work with people under the pressure
218.668	of an ever-changing situation.
221.029	Hospital readiness is critical.
222.723	You are likely to be headed to the emergency room,
224.627	and you want to get this right.
226.406	Prepare a one-page summary of your medical history,
229.269	medications and physician information.
231.557	Put this in a really bright envelope
233.831	with copies of your insurance cards, your power of attorney,
236.667	and your do-not-resuscitate order.
239.067	Have advocates keep a set in their car.
240.689	Tape a set to your refrigerator.
242.576	When you show up in the E.R. with this packet,
244.811	your admission is streamlined in a material way.
248.534	You're going to need caregivers.
251.139	You'll need to assess your personality and financial situation
254.769	to determine whether an elder care community
257.793	or staying at home is your best choice.
260.192	In either case, do not settle.
262.899	We went through a number of not-quite-right caregivers
266.265	before we found the perfect team
268.865	led by Marsha,
271.104	who won't let you win at bingo just because you're dying
277.826	but will go out and take videos of your ranch for you
280.402	when you can't get out there,
282.828	and Caitlin, who won't let you skip your morning exercises
285.555	but knows when you need to hear
287.161	that your wife is in good hands.
290.753	Finally, last words.
293.38	What do you want to hear at the very end,
294.731	and from whom would you like to hear it?
297.339	In my experience, you'll want to hear
299.666	that whatever you're worried about is going to be fine.
303.668	When you believe it's okay to let go, you will.
307.62	So, this is a topic that normally inspires fear and denial.
313.49	What I've learned
315.596	is if we put some time into planning our end of life,
318.531	we have the best chance of maintaining our quality of life.
321.945	Here are Jim and Shirley just after deciding
324.525	who would take care of their ranch.
326.997	Here's Jim just a few weeks before he died,
330.357	celebrating a birthday he didn't expect to see.
333.731	And here's Shirley just a few days before she died
337.749	being read an article in that day's paper
339.76	about the significance of the wildlife refuge
342.085	at the Modini ranch.
344.341	Jim and Shirley had a good end of life,
347.094	and by sharing their story with you,
349.527	I hope to increase our chances of doing the same.
352.382	Thank you.
353.669	(Applause)
