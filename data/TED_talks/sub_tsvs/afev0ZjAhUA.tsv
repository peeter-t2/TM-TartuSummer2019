13.206	I'm driven by pure passion
15.366	to create photographs that tell stories.
18.767	Photography can be described
18.767	as the recording of a single moment
23.269	frozen within a fraction of time.
26.184	Each moment or photograph
26.184	represents a tangible piece
30.361	of our memories as time passes.
33.547	But what if you could capture more
33.547	than one moment in a photograph?
37.551	What if a photograph
37.551	could actually collapse time,
41.222	compressing the best moments
41.222	of the day and the night
44.164	seamlessly into one single image?
47.395	I've created a concept
47.395	"called ""Day to Night"""
50.196	and I believe it's going to change
51.847	the way you look at the world.
53.308	I know it has for me.
55.26	My process begins by photographing
55.26	iconic locations,
59.894	places that are part of what I call
59.894	our collective memory.
63.57	I photograph from a fixed vantage point,
63.57	and I never move.
67.024	I capture the fleeting moments
67.024	of humanity and light as time passes.
71.981	Photographing for anywhere
71.981	from 15 to 30 hours
74.872	and shooting over 1,500 images,
77.508	I then choose the best moments
77.508	of the day and night.
81.6	Using time as a guide,
83.034	I seamlessly blend those best moments
83.034	into one single photograph,
87.351	visualizing our conscious
87.351	journey with time.
91.431	I can take you to Paris
93.424	for a view from the Tournelle Bridge.
96.342	And I can show you the
96.342	early morning rowers
98.48	along the River Seine.
100.554	And simultaneously,
102.42	I can show you Notre Dame aglow at night.
105.82	And in between, I can show you
105.82	the romance of the City of Light.
111.885	I am essentially a street photographer
111.885	from 50 feet in the air,
115.201	and every single thing you see
115.201	in this photograph
117.555	actually happened on this day.
122.549	Day to Night is a global project,
124.726	and my work has always been about history.
127.975	I'm fascinated by the concept
127.975	of going to a place like Venice
131.441	and actually seeing it during
131.441	a specific event.
133.993	And I decided I wanted to see
133.993	the historical Regata,
137.45	an event that's actually been
137.45	taking place since 1498.
141.906	The boats and the costumes
141.906	look exactly as they did then.
146.821	And an important element that I really
146.821	want you guys to understand is:
150.347	this is not a timelapse,
151.845	this is me photographing
151.845	throughout the day and the night.
157.181	I am a relentless collector
157.181	of magical moments.
160.848	And the thing that drives me
160.848	is the fear of just missing one of them.
168.227	The entire concept came about in 1996.
172.893	LIFE Magazine commissioned me
172.893	to create a panoramic photograph
177.142	of the cast and crew of Baz Luhrmann's
177.142	film Romeo + Juliet.
182.71	I got to the set and realized:
182.71	it's a square.
186.111	So the only way I could actually create
186.111	a panoramic was to shoot a collage
190.533	of 250 single images.
193.391	So I had DiCaprio and Claire Danes
193.391	embracing.
196.973	And as I pan my camera to the right,
199.787	I noticed there was a mirror on the wall
202.409	and I saw they were
202.409	actually reflecting in it.
204.848	And for that one moment, that one image
206.802	"I asked them, ""Would you guys just kiss"
208.692	"for this one picture?"""
210.085	And then I came back
210.085	to my studio in New York,
212.9	and I hand-glued these 250 images together
216.845	and stood back and went,
216.845	"""Wow, this is so cool!"
219.694	"I'm changing time in a photograph."""
222.422	And that concept actually
222.422	stayed with me for 13 years
226.636	until technology finally
226.636	has caught up to my dreams.
231.401	This is an image I created
231.401	of the Santa Monica Pier, Day to Night.
234.88	And I'm going to show you a little video
236.833	that gives you an idea of what
236.833	it's like being with me
239.41	when I do these pictures.
241.33	To start with, you have to understand
241.33	that to get views like this,
244.79	most of my time is spent up high,
244.79	and I'm usually in a cherry picker
248.543	or a crane.
249.718	So this is a typical day,
253.134	capturing the entire day unfold.
256.29	One of the things that's great
256.29	is I love to people-watch.
259.29	And trust me when I tell you,
260.727	this is the greatest seat
260.727	in the house to have.
264.226	But this is really how I go about
264.226	creating these photographs.
267.785	So once I decide on my view
267.785	and the location,
271.521	I have to decide where day begins
271.521	and night ends.
274.704	And that's what I call the time vector.
277.476	Einstein described time as a fabric.
281.257	Think of the surface of a trampoline:
283.659	it warps and stretches with gravity.
286.924	I see time as a fabric as well,
289.742	except I take that fabric and flatten it,
289.742	compress it into single plane.
295.095	One of the unique aspects
295.095	of this work is also,
297.318	if you look at all my pictures,
298.842	the time vector changes:
300.376	sometimes I'll go left to right,
302.086	sometimes front to back,
302.086	up or down, even diagonally.
307.249	I am exploring the space-time continuum
310.01	within a two-dimensional still photograph.
313.114	Now when I do these pictures,
315.042	it's literally like a real-time puzzle
315.042	going on in my mind.
318.75	I build a photograph based on time,
321.432	and this is what I call the master plate.
323.766	This can take us several
323.766	months to complete.
327.126	The fun thing about this work is
329.449	I have absolutely zero control
329.449	when I get up there
332.803	on any given day and capture photographs.
335.218	So I never know who's
335.218	going to be in the picture,
337.536	if it's going to be a great
337.536	sunrise or sunset -- no control.
340.543	It's at the end of the process,
342.385	if I've had a really great day
342.385	and everything remained the same,
345.417	that I then decide who's in and who's out,
348.05	and it's all based on time.
349.809	I'll take those best moments that I pick
349.809	over a month of editing
353.256	and they get seamlessly blended
353.256	into the master plate.
358.168	I'm compressing the day and night
360.487	as I saw it,
362.151	creating a unique harmony between
362.151	these two very discordant worlds.
367.268	Painting has always been a really
367.268	important influence in all my work
371.13	and I've always been a huge fan
371.13	of Albert Bierstadt,
373.865	the great Hudson River School painter.
375.723	He inspired a recent series
375.723	that I did on the National Parks.
379.12	This is Bierstadt's Yosemite Valley.
382.347	So this is the photograph
382.347	I created of Yosemite.
385.427	This is actually the cover story
385.427	of the 2016 January issue
389.23	of National Geographic.
391.592	I photographed for over
394.371	I was literally on the side of a cliff,
397.044	capturing the stars
397.044	and the moonlight as it transitions,
401.109	the moonlight lighting El Capitan.
402.988	And I also captured this transition
402.988	of time throughout the landscape.
407.641	The best part is obviously seeing
407.641	the magical moments of humanity
411.614	as time changed --
414.831	from day into night.
418.072	And on a personal note,
419.634	I actually had a photocopy
419.634	of Bierstadt's painting in my pocket.
423.783	And when that sun started
423.783	to rise in the valley,
426.055	I started to literally shake
426.055	with excitement
428.329	because I looked at the painting and I go,
430.631	"""Oh my god, I'm getting Bierstadt's"
430.631	exact same lighting
437.757	Day to Night is about all the things,
440.64	it's like a compilation of all
440.64	the things I love
442.911	about the medium of photography.
445.071	It's about landscape,
446.748	it's about street photography,
448.371	it's about color, it's about architecture,
450.697	perspective, scale --
450.697	and, especially, history.
454.371	This is one of the most historical moments
456.396	I've been able to photograph,
457.808	the 2013 Presidential Inauguration
457.808	of Barack Obama.
461.682	And if you look closely in this picture,
463.831	you can actually see time changing
465.932	in those large television sets.
467.901	You can see Michelle
467.901	waiting with the children,
470.541	the president now greets the crowd,
472.424	he takes his oath,
473.7	and now he's speaking to the people.
476.698	There's so many challenging aspects
476.698	when I create photographs like this.
481.096	For this particular photograph,
483.093	I was in a 50-foot scissor lift
483.093	up in the air
486.732	and it was not very stable.
488.05	So every time my assistant and I
488.05	shifted our weight,
491.242	our horizon line shifted.
492.804	So for every picture you see,
494.447	and there were about
494.447	1,800 in this picture,
496.86	we both had to tape our feet into position
499.843	every time I clicked the shutter.
502.01	(Applause)
506.202	I've learned so many extraordinary
506.202	things doing this work.
510.868	I think the two most important
510.868	are patience
514.297	and the power of observation.
516.958	When you photograph a city
516.958	like New York from above,
520.384	I discovered that those people in cars
522.522	that I sort of live with everyday,
524.856	they don't look like people
524.856	in cars anymore.
526.936	They feel like a giant school of fish,
529.438	it was a form of emergent behavior.
532.063	And when people describe
532.063	the energy of New York,
535.007	I think this photograph begins
535.007	to really capture that.
538.26	When you look closer in my work,
540.019	you can see there's stories going on.
542.235	You realize that Times Square is a canyon,
545.198	it's shadow and it's sunlight.
547.883	So I decided, in this photograph,
547.883	I would checkerboard time.
551.105	So wherever the shadows are, it's night
553.19	and wherever the sun is,
553.19	it's actually day.
556.453	Time is this extraordinary thing
558.727	that we never can really
558.727	wrap our heads around.
561.94	But in a very unique and special way,
563.966	I believe these photographs
563.966	begin to put a face on time.
568.703	They embody a new
568.703	metaphysical visual reality.
574.996	When you spend 15 hours
574.996	looking at a place,
578.917	you're going to see things
578.917	a little differently
581.148	than if you or I walked up
581.148	with our camera,
583.18	took a picture, and then walked away.
585.175	This was a perfect example.
587.175	"I call it ""Sacré-Coeur Selfie."""
589.667	I watched over 15 hours
591.469	all these people
591.469	not even look at Sacré-Coeur.
594.041	They were more interested
594.041	in using it as a backdrop.
597.106	They would walk up, take a picture,
599.958	and then walk away.
602.089	And I found this to be an absolutely
602.089	extraordinary example,
607.239	a powerful disconnect between
607.239	what we think the human experience is
611.723	versus what the human experience
611.723	is evolving into.
615.922	The act of sharing has suddenly
615.922	become more important
620.788	than the experience itself.
623.416	(Applause)
626.681	And finally, my most recent image,
629.841	which has such a special meaning
629.841	for me personally:
633.135	this is the Serengeti National
633.135	Park in Tanzania.
636.925	And this is photographed
636.925	in the middle of the Seronera,
639.521	this is not a reserve.
641.532	I went specifically during
641.532	the peak migration
644.464	to hopefully capture
644.464	the most diverse range of animals.
648.503	Unfortunately, when we got there,
650.107	there was a drought going on
650.107	during the peak migration,
652.711	a five-week drought.
653.886	So all the animals
653.886	were drawn to the water.
656.503	I found this one watering hole,
658.768	and felt if everything remained
658.768	the same way it was behaving,
662.817	I had a real opportunity
662.817	to capture something unique.
666.325	We spent three days studying it,
668.154	and nothing could have prepared me
669.845	for what I witnessed during our shoot day.
672.438	I photographed for 26 hours
675.27	in a sealed crocodile blind,
679.34	What I witnessed was unimaginable.
681.92	Frankly, it was Biblical.
683.491	We saw, for 26 hours,
685.57	all these competitive species
685.57	share a single resource called water.
691.115	The same resource that humanity
691.115	is supposed to have wars over
694.999	during the next 50 years.
697.301	The animals never even
697.301	grunted at each other.
701.515	They seem to understand something
701.515	that we humans don't.
705.65	That this precious resource called water
708.479	is something we all have to share.
711.699	When I created this picture,
715.222	I realized that Day to Night
715.222	is really a new way of seeing,
720.127	compressing time,
722.349	exploring the space-time continuum
722.349	within a photograph.
726.809	As technology evolves
726.809	along with photography,
731.229	photographs will not only communicate
731.229	a deeper meaning of time and memory,
735.92	but they will compose a new narrative
735.92	of untold stories,
742.594	creating a timeless window into our world.
747.285	Thank you.
748.46	(Applause)
