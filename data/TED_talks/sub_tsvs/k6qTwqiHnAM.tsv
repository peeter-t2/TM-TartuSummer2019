15.916	Living with a physical
15.916	disability isn't easy
19.157	anywhere in the world,
21.38	but if you live in a country
21.38	like the United States,
24.209	there's certain appurtenances available
24.209	to you that do make life easier.
27.302	So if you're in a building,
27.302	you can take an elevator.
29.975	If you're crossing the street,
29.975	you have sidewalk cutouts.
32.255	And if you have to travel
32.255	some distance farther
34.518	than you can do under your own power,
34.518	there's accessible vehicles,
37.685	and if you can't afford one of those,
39.546	there's accessible public transportation.
41.919	But in the developing world,
41.919	things are quite different.
44.61	There's 40 million people who need
44.61	a wheelchair but don't have one,
47.829	and the majority of these
47.829	people live in rural areas,
51.184	where the only connections to community,
51.184	to employment, to education,
55.069	are by traveling long
55.069	distances on rough terrain
57.552	often under their own power.
60.289	And the devices usually
60.289	available to these people
62.647	are not made for that context,
62.647	break down quickly,
65.105	and are hard to repair.
67.415	I started looking at wheelchairs
67.415	in developing countries in 2005,
72.135	when I spent the summer assessing
72.135	the state of technology in Tanzania,
75.951	and I talked to wheelchair users, wheelchair
75.951	manufacturers, disability groups,
79.764	and what stood out to me
81.621	is that there wasn't a device available
84.073	that was designed for rural
84.073	areas, that could go fast
86.621	and efficiently on many types of terrain.
89.237	So being a mechanical engineer,
91.02	being at MIT and having lots
91.02	of resources available to me,
93.806	I thought I'd try to do
93.806	something about it.
96.12	Now when you're talking
96.12	about trying to travel
99.073	long distances on rough terrain,
101.279	I immediately thought of a mountain bike,
103.012	and a mountain bike's good at doing this
104.425	because it has a gear train,
106.264	and you can shift to a low gear
106.264	if you have to climb a hill
109.098	or go through mud or sand
110.724	and you get a lot of torque
110.724	but a low speed.
112.838	And if you want to go
112.838	faster, say on pavement,
114.953	you can shift to a high gear,
116.358	and you get less torque,
116.358	but higher speeds.
118.43	So the logical evolution here
120.011	is to just make a wheelchair
120.011	with mountain bike components,
122.845	which many people have done.
124.203	But these are two products
124.203	available in the U.S. that
127.385	would be difficult to transfer
127.385	into developing countries
130.076	because they're much, much too expensive.
132.626	And the context I'm talking about is where
134.902	you need to have a product
134.902	that is less than 200 dollars.
138.898	And this ideal product
138.898	would also be able to go
141.329	about five kilometers a day so you
141.329	could get to your job, get to school,
145.333	and do it on many,
145.333	many different types of terrain.
147.185	But when you get home or want
147.185	to go indoors at your work,
150.077	it's got to be small enough and maneuverable
150.077	enough to use inside.
154.498	And furthermore, if you want it to last
154.498	a long time out in rural areas,
157.903	it has to be repairable using the local
157.903	tools, materials and knowledge
161.965	in those contexts.
164.781	So the real crux of the problem here is,
167.721	how do you make a system
167.721	that's a simple device
170.869	but gives you a large
170.869	mechanical advantage?
173	How do you make a mountain
173	bike for your arms
175.187	that doesn't have the mountain
175.187	bike cost and complexity?
177.878	So as is the case with simple solutions,
180.279	oftentimes the answer is right in front
180.279	of your face, and for us it was levers.
184.065	We use levers all the time,
184.065	in tools, doorknobs, bicycle parts.
188.699	And that moment of inspiration,
188.699	that key invention moment,
191.485	was when I was sitting
191.485	in front of my design notebook
194.033	and I started thinking
194.033	about somebody grabbing a lever,
196.805	and if they grab
196.805	near the end of the lever,
198.918	they can get an effectively long lever
200.752	and produce a lot of torque
200.752	as they push back and forth,
203.577	and effectively get a low gear.
205.797	And as they slide
205.797	their hand down the lever,
208.204	they can push with a smaller
208.204	effective lever length,
211.04	but push through a bigger
211.04	angle every stroke,
213.16	which makes a faster rotational speed,
213.16	and gives you an effective high gear.
216.819	So what's exciting about this system
218.571	is that it's really, really
218.571	mechanically simple,
221.174	and you could make it using technology
223.008	that's been around for hundreds of years.
224.99	So seeing this in practice,
227.175	this is the Leveraged Freedom Chair that,
229.152	after a few years of development,
230.892	we're now going into production with,
232.829	and this is a full-time wheelchair user --
234.853	he's paralyzed -- in Guatemala,
236.394	and you see he's able to traverse
236.394	pretty rough terrain.
240.393	Again, the key innovation of this technology
240.393	is that when he wants to go fast,
244.924	he just grabs the levers near the pivots
244.924	and goes through a big angle every stroke,
248.979	and as the going gets tougher, he just
248.979	slides his hands up the levers,
251.904	creates more torque, and kind
251.904	of bench-presses his way
254.5	out of trouble through the rough terrain.
256.686	Now the big, important point here is that
259.698	the person is the complex
259.698	machine in this system.
262.411	It's the person that's sliding
262.411	his hands up and down the levers,
265.757	so the mechanism itself can be very simple
268.479	and composed of bicycle parts you
268.479	can get anywhere in the world.
271.551	Because those bicycle parts
273.142	are so ubiquitously available,
273.142	they're super-cheap.
275.647	They're made by the gazillions
275.647	in China and India,
277.827	and we can source them
277.827	anywhere in the world,
279.683	build the chair anywhere,
279.683	and most importantly repair it,
282.422	even out in a village
282.422	with a local bicycle mechanic
284.875	who has local tools, knowledge
284.875	and parts available.
289.23	Now, when you want to use the LFC indoors,
291.907	all you have to do is pull
291.907	the levers out of the drivetrain,
295.427	stow them in the frame, and it
295.427	converts into a normal wheelchair
298.704	that you can use just
298.704	like any other normal wheelchair,
301.348	and we sized it like a normal wheelchair,
303.365	so it's narrow enough to fit
303.365	through a standard doorway,
307.5	it's low enough to fit under a table,
311.019	and it's small and maneuverable
311.019	enough to fit in a bathroom
315.012	and this is important so the user
315.012	can get up close to a toilet,
318.036	and be able to transfer off
319.74	just like he could in a normal wheelchair.
325.331	Now, there's three important
325.331	points that I want to stress
328.423	that I think really hit
328.423	home in this project.
332.055	The first is that this
332.055	product works well because
335.259	we were effectively able to combine
337.29	rigorous engineering science
337.29	and analysis with user-centered design
341.844	focused on the social and usage
341.844	and economic factors
345.221	important to wheelchair users
345.221	in the developing countries.
347.758	So I'm an academic at MIT,
347.758	and I'm a mechanical engineer,
350.246	so I can do things like look at the type
350.246	of terrain you want to travel on,
353.794	and figure out how much
353.794	resistance it should impose,
356.442	look at the parts we have
356.442	available and mix and match them
359.45	to figure out what sort
359.45	of gear trains we can use,
362.095	and then look at the power and force
362.095	you can get out of your upper body
365.204	to analyze how fast you should
365.204	be able to go in this chair
367.167	as you put your arms
367.167	up and down the levers.
369.538	So as a wet-behind-the-ears
369.538	student, excited,
373.197	our team made a prototype,
375.322	brought that prototype to Tanzania,
375.322	Kenya and Vietnam in 2008,
380.197	and found it was terrible
382.331	because we didn't get
382.331	enough input from users.
384.768	So because we tested it
384.768	with wheelchair users,
387.934	with wheelchair manufacturers,
387.934	we got that feedback from them,
390.44	not just articulating their problems,
390.44	but articulating their solutions,
393.894	and worked together to go back
393.894	to the drawing board and make a new design,
397.442	which we brought back
397.442	to East Africa in '09
399.592	that worked a lot better than a normal
399.592	wheelchair on rough terrain,
402.437	but it still didn't work well
402.437	indoors because it was too big,
405.319	it was heavy, it was hard to move around,
407.317	so again with that user feedback,
407.317	we went back to the drawing board,
410.871	came up with a better
410.871	design, 20 pounds lighter,
413.186	as narrow as a regular wheelchair, tested
413.186	that in a field trial in Guatemala,
416.877	and that advanced the product to the point
418.901	where we have now that it's going
418.901	into production.
422.124	Now also being engineering scientists,
424.37	we were able to quantify the performance
424.37	benefits of the Leveraged Freedom Chair,
428.252	so here are some shots
428.252	of our trial in Guatemala
430.892	where we tested the LFC
430.892	on village terrain,
434.434	and tested people's biomechanical outputs,
436.458	their oxygen consumption,
436.458	how fast they go,
438.645	how much power they're putting out,
440.336	both in their regular
440.336	wheelchairs and using the LFC,
443.235	and we found that the LFC
443.235	is about 80 percent faster
445.736	going on these terrains
445.736	than a normal wheelchair.
448.094	It's also about 40 percent more
448.094	efficient than a regular wheelchair,
451.477	and because of the mechanical
451.477	advantage you get from the levers,
454.02	you can produce 50 percent higher torque
455.949	and really muscle your way
455.949	through the really, really rough terrain.
459.933	Now the second lesson
459.933	that we learned in this is that
463.369	the constraints on this design
463.369	really push the innovation,
466.269	because we had to hit
466.269	such a low price point,
468.533	because we had to make
468.533	a device that could travel
470.843	on many, many types of terrain
470.843	but still be usable indoors,
473.662	and be simple enough to repair,
475.953	we ended up with a fundamentally
475.953	new product,
478.32	a new product that is an innovation
480.436	in a space that really hasn't
480.436	changed in a hundred years.
483.353	And these are all merits that are not
483.353	just good in the developing world.
486.806	Why not in countries like the U.S. too?
489.245	So we teamed up with Continuum,
490.981	a local product design firm here in Boston
493.005	to make the high-end version,
493.005	the developed world version,
496.013	that we'll probably sell primarily
496.013	in the U.S. and Europe,
498.799	but to higher-income buyers.
501.6	And the final point I want
501.6	to make is that I think
504.586	this project worked
504.586	well because we engaged
507.412	all the stakeholders that buy into this
507.412	project and are important to consider
512.023	in bringing the technology
512.023	from inception of an idea
515.366	through innovation, validation,
515.366	commercialization and dissemination,
519.605	and that cycle has to start
519.605	and end with end users.
523.35	These are the people that define
523.35	the requirements of the technology,
526.125	and these are the people that have
526.125	to give the thumbs-up at the end,
528.463	"and say, ""Yeah, it actually works."
528.463	"It meets our needs."""
531.107	So people like me in the academic space,
533.037	we can do things like innovate
533.037	and analyze and test,
536.408	create data and make
536.408	bench-level prototypes,
539.504	but how do you get that bench-level
539.504	prototype to commercialization?
542.671	So we need gap-fillers like Continuum
542.671	that can work on commercializing,
546.083	and we started a whole NGO
546.083	to bring our chair to market --
548.869	Global Research Innovation Technology --
551.034	and then we also teamed up with a big
551.034	manufacturer in India, Pinnacle Industries,
554.766	that's tooled up now
554.766	to make 500 chairs a month
557.029	and will make the first
557.029	batch of 200 next month,
558.832	which will be delivered in India.
560.8	And then finally, to get this
560.8	out to the people in scale,
563.539	we teamed up with the largest
563.539	disability organization
566.087	in the world, Jaipur Foot.
568.374	Now what's powerful about this model
570.653	is when you bring together
570.653	all these stakeholders
573.46	that represent each link in the chain
575.429	from inception of an idea
577.97	all the way to implementation
577.97	in the field,
580.738	that's where the magic happens.
582.289	That's where you can take
582.289	a guy like me, an academic,
584.837	but analyze and test
584.837	and create a new technology
587.865	and quantitatively determine
587.865	how much better the performance is.
591.401	You can connect with stakeholders
591.401	like the manufacturers
594.062	and talk with them face-to-face
594.062	and leverage their
596.322	local knowledge of manufacturing
596.322	practices and their clients
599.193	and combine that knowledge
599.193	with our engineering knowledge
601.932	to create something greater
601.932	than either of us could have done alone.
605.262	And then you can also engage the end user
607.793	in the design process, and not
607.793	just ask him what he needs,
610.579	but ask him how he thinks
610.579	it can be achieved.
613.528	And this picture was taken
613.528	in India in our last field trial,
616.585	where we had a 90-percent
616.585	adoption rate where people
619.086	switched to using our Leveraged Freedom
619.086	Chair over their normal wheelchair,
622.692	and this picture specifically is of Ashok,
625.653	and Ashok had a spinal injury
625.653	when he fell out of a tree,
628.685	and he had been working at a tailor,
628.685	but once he was injured
631.567	he wasn't able to transport
631.567	himself from his house
634.45	over a kilometer to his shop
634.45	in his normal wheelchair.
637.25	The road was too rough.
638.521	But the day after he got
638.521	an LFC, he hopped in it,
641.442	rode that kilometer, opened up his shop
643.526	and soon after landed a contract
643.526	to make school uniforms
646.242	and started making money, started
646.242	providing for his family again.
649.362	Ashok: You also encouraged me to work.
651.211	I rested for a day at home.
653.935	The next day I went to my shop.
658.391	Now everything is back to normal.
661.369	Amos Winter: And thank you
661.369	very much for having me today.
665.454	(Applause)
