16.33	I'd like to talk to you today
16.33	about the scale of the scientific effort
19.68	that goes into making the headlines
19.68	you see in the paper.
22.384	Headlines that look like this
22.384	when they have to do with climate change;
25.757	and like this when they have to do
25.757	with air quality or smog.
28.627	They're two branches of the same field
28.627	of atmospheric science.
31.591	Recently, the headlines looked like this
33.547	when the Intergovernmental Panel
33.547	on Climate Change, or IPCC,
36.413	put out their report
37.588	on the state of understanding
37.588	of the atmospheric system.
40.249	That report was written
40.249	by 620 scientists from 40 countries.
43.254	They wrote almost
43.254	1,000 pages on the topic,
45.779	and all of those pages were reviewed
47.547	by another 400-plus
47.547	scientists and reviewers
49.698	from 113 countries.
51.416	It's a big community;
52.706	such a big community, in fact,
54.188	that our annual gathering is the largest
54.188	scientific meeting in the world.
57.667	Over 15,000 scientists go
57.667	to San Francisco every year for that.
60.645	Every one of those scientists
60.645	is in a research group,
63.276	and every research group studies
63.276	a wide variety of topics.
66.029	For us at Cambridge, it's as varied
66.029	as the El Ni√±o Oscillation,
69.027	which affects weather and climate,
70.715	to the assimilation of satellite data,
72.571	to emissions from crops that produce
72.571	biofuels, which is what I study.
75.854	And in each one of these research areas,
75.854	of which there are even more,
79.196	there are PhD students, like me,
79.196	and we study incredibly narrow topics,
82.58	things as narrow as a few processes
82.58	or a few molecules.
85.201	And one of the molecules I study
85.201	is called isoprene, which is here.
88.439	It's a small organic molecule.
90.11	You've probably never heard of it.
91.778	The weight of a paper clip
91.778	is approximately equal
94.204	to 900 zeta-illion -- 10 to the 21st --
94.204	molecules of isoprene.
97.859	But despite its very small weight,
99.982	enough of it is emitted
99.982	into the atmosphere every year
102.562	to equal the weight
102.562	of all the people on the planet.
105.062	It's a huge amount of stuff.
105.062	It's equal to the weight of methane.
108.143	And because it's so much stuff,
109.648	it's really important
109.648	for the atmospheric system.
111.986	Because it's important
111.986	to the atmospheric system,
114.306	we go to all lengths to study this thing.
116.287	We blow it up and look at the pieces.
118.082	This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain.
120.114	Atmospheric explosions,
120.114	or full combustion,
122.162	takes about 15,000 times longer
122.162	than what happens in your car.
125.096	But still, we look at the pieces.
126.7	We run enormous models on supercomputers;
126.7	this is what I happen to do.
130.069	Our models have hundreds
130.069	of thousands of grid boxes
132.588	calculating hundreds of variables
132.588	each, on minute timescales.
135.619	It takes weeks to perform
135.619	our integrations,
137.699	and we perform dozens of integrations
137.699	in order to understand what's happening.
141.437	We also fly all over the world
141.437	looking for this thing.
144.23	I recently joined a field campaign
144.23	in Malaysia -- there are others.
147.435	We found a global atmospheric
147.435	watchtower there
149.658	in the middle of the rainforest,
151.236	and hung hundreds of thousands
151.236	of dollars' worth of scientific equipment
154.663	off this tower,
155.838	to look for isoprene and other things
155.838	while we were there.
158.628	This is the tower in the middle
158.628	of the rainforest from above,
161.527	and the tower from below.
162.751	On part of that field campaign
162.751	we even brought an aircraft with us.
165.966	And this plane, the model BAe-146,
165.966	which was run by FAAM,
168.657	normally flies 120 to 130 people,
170.725	so maybe you took a similar aircraft
170.725	to get here today.
173.334	But we didn't just fly it.
174.61	We were flying at 100 meters
174.61	above the top of the canopy
177.327	to measure this molecule --
177.327	incredibly dangerous stuff.
179.974	We have to fly at a special incline
179.974	to make the measurements;
182.891	we hire military and test pilots
182.891	to do the maneuvering;
185.506	we need special flight clearance.
187.134	As you come around the banks
187.134	in these valleys,
189.311	the forces can get up to two Gs;
190.871	the scientists must be
190.871	completely harnessed in
193.055	in order to make measurements
193.055	while on board.
195.178	So as you can imagine,
196.356	the inside of the aircraft doesn't look
196.356	like one you'd take on vacation.
199.787	It's a flying laboratory we took
199.787	to make measurements of this molecule.
203.357	We do all this to understand
203.357	the chemistry of one molecule.
206.467	And when one student like me
206.467	has some sort of inclination
209.175	or understanding about that molecule,
211	they write one scientific paper
211	on the subject.
213.241	And out of that field campaign
213.241	we'll probably get a few dozen papers
216.485	on a few dozen processes or molecules.
218.346	As a body of knowledge builds up,
218.346	it will form one subsection,
221.316	or one sub-subsection,
222.491	of an assessment like the IPCC,
222.491	although we have others.
225.805	And each one of the 11 chapters
225.805	of the IPCC has six to ten subsections.
230.765	So you can imagine
230.765	the scale of the effort.
232.829	In each one of the assessments we write,
232.829	we always tag on a summary,
236.516	and the summary is written
236.516	for a non-scientific audience.
239.222	And we hand that summary
239.222	to journalists and policy makers
241.986	in order to make headlines like these.
244.723	Thank you very much.
245.935	(Applause)
