12.717	An evolutionary biologist
12.717	at Purdue University
16.014	named William Muir studied chickens.
19.52	He was interested in productivity --
21.249	I think it's something
21.249	that concerns all of us --
23.539	but it's easy to measure in chickens
23.539	because you just count the eggs.
26.827	(Laughter)
28.527	He wanted to know what could make
28.527	his chickens more productive,
31.944	so he devised a beautiful experiment.
34.87	Chickens live in groups, so first of all,
34.87	he selected just an average flock,
39.328	and he let it alone for six generations.
42.718	But then he created a second group
44.807	of the individually
44.807	most productive chickens --
47.315	you could call them superchickens --
50.27	and he put them together in a superflock,
52.377	and each generation, he selected
52.377	only the most productive for breeding.
57.415	After six generations had passed,
59.969	what did he find?
61.717	Well, the first group, the average group,
61.717	was doing just fine.
65.548	They were all plump and fully feathered
68.074	and egg production
68.074	had increased dramatically.
70.702	What about the second group?
73.419	Well, all but three were dead.
76.253	They'd pecked the rest to death.
78.413	(Laughter)
79.99	The individually productive chickens
79.99	had only achieved their success
85.501	by suppressing the productivity
85.501	of the rest.
90.83	Now, as I've gone around the world
90.83	talking about this and telling this story
94.525	in all sorts of organizations
94.525	and companies,
96.777	people have seen
96.777	the relevance almost instantly,
99.353	and they come up and they say
99.353	things to me like,
101.659	"""That superflock, that's my company."""
104.75	(Laughter)
106.715	"Or, ""That's my country."""
110.226	"Or, ""That's my life."""
112.798	All my life I've been told that the way
112.798	we have to get ahead is to compete:
116.722	get into the right school,
116.722	get into the right job, get to the top,
120.754	and I've really never found it
120.754	very inspiring.
124.492	I've started and run businesses
124.492	because invention is a joy,
129.275	and because working alongside
129.275	brilliant, creative people
132.595	is its own reward.
134.755	And I've never really felt very motivated
134.755	by pecking orders or by superchickens
140.397	or by superstars.
143.276	But for the past 50 years,
145.22	we've run most organizations
145.22	and some societies
149.452	along the superchicken model.
151.96	We've thought that success is achieved
151.96	by picking the superstars,
155.582	the brightest men,
155.582	or occasionally women, in the room,
159.731	and giving them all the resources
159.731	and all the power.
163.43	And the result has been just the same
163.43	as in William Muir's experiment:
167.493	aggression, dysfunction and waste.
172.462	If the only way the most productive
172.462	can be successful
176.572	is by suppressing
176.572	the productivity of the rest,
179.753	then we badly need to find
179.753	a better way to work
183.236	and a richer way to live.
186.51	(Applause)
190.921	So what is it that makes some groups
194.915	obviously more successful
194.915	and more productive than others?
198.7	Well, that's the question
198.7	a team at MIT took to research.
201.974	They brought in hundreds of volunteers,
204.4	they put them into groups, and they
204.4	gave them very hard problems to solve.
207.894	And what happened was exactly
207.894	what you'd expect,
210.625	that some groups were very much
210.625	more successful than others,
213.931	but what was really interesting
213.931	was that the high-achieving groups
217.461	were not those where they had
217.461	one or two people
220.108	with spectacularly high I.Q.
223.149	Nor were the most successful groups
223.149	the ones that had the highest
226.748	aggregate I.Q.
229.117	Instead, they had three characteristics,
229.117	the really successful teams.
234.991	First of all, they showed high degrees
234.991	of social sensitivity to each other.
240.633	This is measured by something called
240.633	the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test.
244.232	It's broadly considered
244.232	a test for empathy,
246.717	and the groups that scored highly on this
248.914	did better.
250.864	Secondly, the successful groups
250.864	gave roughly equal time to each other,
255.972	so that no one voice dominated,
258.317	but neither were there any passengers.
261.103	And thirdly, the more successful groups
263.82	had more women in them.
266.165	(Applause)
268.162	Now, was this because women
268.162	typically score more highly on
272.437	the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test,
274.31	so you're getting a doubling down
274.31	on the empathy quotient?
277.037	Or was it because they brought
277.037	a more diverse perspective?
279.795	We don't really know, but the striking
279.795	thing about this experiment
283.951	is that it showed what we know, which is
283.951	some groups do better than others,
288.38	but what's key to that
290.731	is their social connectedness
290.731	to each other.
295.543	So how does this play out
295.543	in the real world?
298.375	Well, it means that what happens
298.375	between people really counts,
303.716	because in groups that are highly
303.716	attuned and sensitive to each other,
307.524	ideas can flow and grow.
310.78	People don't get stuck.
310.78	They don't waste energy down dead ends.
314.768	An example: Arup is one of the world's
314.768	most successful engineering firms,
319.482	and it was commissioned to build
319.482	the equestrian center
322.134	for the Beijing Olympics.
324	Now, this building had to receive
325.826	two and a half thousand
325.826	really highly strung thoroughbred horses
331.12	that were coming off long-haul flights,
333.209	highly jet-lagged,
333.209	not feeling their finest.
336.692	And the problem
336.692	the engineer confronted was,
340.104	what quantity of waste to cater for?
344.54	Now, you don't get taught this
344.54	in engineering school -- (Laughter) --
349.184	and it's not really the kind of thing
349.184	you want to get wrong,
352.388	so he could have spent months
352.388	talking to vets, doing the research,
355.853	tweaking the spreadsheet.
357.654	Instead, he asked for help
360.799	and he found someone who had designed
360.799	the Jockey Club in New York.
365.285	The problem was solved in less than a day.
369.404	Arup believes that
369.404	the culture of helpfulness
372.191	is central to their success.
375.279	Now, helpfulness sounds really anemic,
379.4	but it's absolutely core
379.4	to successful teams,
383.498	and it routinely outperforms
383.498	individual intelligence.
389.117	Helpfulness means I don't
389.117	have to know everything,
392.322	I just have to work among people
392.322	who are good at getting and giving help.
397.6	At SAP, they reckon that you can answer
397.6	any question in 17 minutes.
404.131	But there isn't a single
404.131	high-tech company I've worked with
407.126	that imagines for a moment
407.126	that this is a technology issue,
412.571	because what drives helpfulness
412.571	is people getting to know each other.
417.771	Now that sounds so obvious, and we think
417.771	it'll just happen normally,
422.782	but it doesn't.
424.41	When I was running
424.41	my first software company,
427.704	I realized that we were getting stuck.
429.738	There was a lot of friction,
429.738	but not much else,
433.523	and I gradually realized the brilliant,
433.523	creative people that I'd hired
438.399	didn't know each other.
440.364	They were so focused
440.364	on their own individual work,
444.241	they didn't even know
444.241	who they were sitting next to,
447.97	and it was only when I insisted
447.97	that we stop working
450.541	and invest time in getting
450.541	to know each other
453.125	that we achieved real momentum.
456.813	Now, that was 20 years ago,
456.813	and now I visit companies
459.409	that have banned coffee cups at desks
462.311	because they want people to hang out
462.311	around the coffee machines
466.305	and talk to each other.
468.139	The Swedes even have
468.139	a special term for this.
470.647	They call it fika, which means
470.647	more than a coffee break.
474.007	It means collective restoration.
477.613	At Idexx, a company up in Maine,
480.724	they've created vegetable gardens
480.724	on campus so that people
483.516	from different parts of the business
485.768	can work together and get to know
485.768	the whole business that way.
490.644	Have they all gone mad?
492.989	Quite the opposite -- they've figured out
492.989	that when the going gets tough,
496.542	and it always will get tough
498.585	if you're doing breakthrough work
498.585	that really matters,
501.301	what people need is social support,
503.972	and they need to know who to ask for help.
507.199	Companies don't have ideas;
507.199	only people do.
511.936	And what motivates people
514.536	are the bonds and loyalty and trust
514.536	they develop between each other.
519.566	What matters is the mortar,
523.26	not just the bricks.
526.299	Now, when you put all of this together,
528.273	what you get is something
528.273	called social capital.
531.431	Social capital is the reliance
531.431	and interdependency that builds trust.
536.98	The term comes from sociologists
536.98	who were studying communities
540.471	that proved particularly resilient
540.471	in times of stress.
545.409	Social capital is what
545.409	gives companies momentum,
549.96	and social capital
549.96	is what makes companies robust.
556.182	What does this mean in practical terms?
558.852	It means that time is everything,
562.759	because social capital
562.759	compounds with time.
567.426	So teams that work together longer
567.426	get better, because it takes time
572.534	to develop the trust you need
572.534	for real candor and openness.
578.461	And time is what builds value.
582.625	When Alex Pentland
582.625	suggested to one company
584.878	that they synchronize coffee breaks
587.594	so that people would have time
587.594	to talk to each other,
591.495	profits went up 15 million dollars,
594.978	and employee satisfaction
594.978	went up 10 percent.
598.832	Not a bad return on social capital,
601.933	which compounds even as you spend it.
605.96	Now, this isn't about chumminess,
605.96	and it's no charter for slackers,
612.022	because people who work this way
612.022	tend to be kind of scratchy,
616.656	impatient, absolutely determined
616.656	to think for themselves
620.69	because that's what their contribution is.
624.68	Conflict is frequent
624.68	because candor is safe.
630.28	And that's how good ideas
630.28	turn into great ideas,
635.471	because no idea is born fully formed.
638.571	It emerges a little bit
638.571	as a child is born,
641.9	kind of messy and confused,
641.9	but full of possibilities.
646.489	And it's only through the generous
646.489	contribution, faith and challenge
652.61	that they achieve their potential.
655.892	And that's what social capital supports.
661.455	Now, we aren't really used
661.455	to talking about this,
664.228	about talent, about creativity,
664.228	in this way.
668.198	We're used to talking about stars.
672.262	So I started to wonder,
672.262	well, if we start working this way,
676.371	does that mean no more stars?
679.445	So I went and I sat in on the auditions
681.805	at the Royal Academy
681.805	of Dramatic Art in London.
685.661	And what I saw there really surprised me,
688.886	because the teachers weren't looking
688.886	for individual pyrotechnics.
693.786	They were looking for what happened
693.786	between the students,
698.476	because that's where the drama is.
702.586	And when I talked
702.586	to producers of hit albums,
704.875	"they said, ""Oh sure, we have"
704.875	lots of superstars in music.
708.103	It's just, they don't last very long.
711.22	It's the outstanding collaborators
711.22	who enjoy the long careers,
715.22	because bringing out the best in others
715.22	is how they found the best
719.432	"in themselves."""
721.686	And when I went to visit companies
721.686	that are renowned
724.115	for their ingenuity and creativity,
726.182	I couldn't even see any superstars,
729.107	because everybody there really mattered.
733.445	And when I reflected on my own career,
736.328	and the extraordinary people
736.328	I've had the privilege to work with,
740.252	I realized how much more
740.252	we could give each other
745.796	if we just stopped trying
745.796	to be superchickens.
751.815	(Laughter) (Applause)
756.97	Once you appreciate
756.97	truly how social work is,
763.346	a lot of things have to change.
766.443	Management by talent contest
766.443	has routinely pitted
770.53	employees against each other.
772.991	Now, rivalry has to be replaced
772.991	by social capital.
778.355	For decades, we've tried
778.355	to motivate people with money,
781.48	even though we've got
781.48	a vast amount of research that shows
784.36	that money erodes social connectedness.
788.851	Now, we need to let people
788.851	motivate each other.
794.646	And for years, we've thought that leaders
794.646	were heroic soloists who were expected,
799.57	all by themselves,
799.57	to solve complex problems.
802.726	Now, we need to redefine leadership
806.278	as an activity in which
806.278	conditions are created
810.342	in which everyone can do their most
810.342	courageous thinking together.
816.3	We know that this works.
820.21	When the Montreal Protocol called
820.21	for the phasing out of CFCs,
824.505	the chlorofluorocarbons implicated
824.505	in the hole in the ozone layer,
828.847	the risks were immense.
831.332	CFCs were everywhere,
834.231	and nobody knew if a substitute
834.231	could be found.
837.36	But one team that rose to the challenge
837.36	adopted three key principles.
843.289	The first was the head of engineering,
843.289	Frank Maslen, said,
846.647	there will be no stars in this team.
849.98	We need everybody.
852.257	Everybody has a valid perspective.
855.485	Second, we work to one standard only:
859.711	the best imaginable.
862.59	And third, he told his boss,
862.59	Geoff Tudhope,
865.632	that he had to butt out,
867.605	because he knew
867.605	how disruptive power can be.
870.856	Now, this didn't mean Tudhope did nothing.
873.689	He gave the team air cover,
875.43	and he listened to ensure
875.43	that they honored their principles.
880.19	And it worked: Ahead of all the other
880.19	companies tackling this hard problem,
886.26	this group cracked it first.
889.738	And to date, the Montreal Protocol
892.339	is the most successful international
892.339	environmental agreement
898.06	ever implemented.
901.402	There was a lot at stake then,
903.94	and there's a lot at stake now,
906.679	and we won't solve our problems
906.679	if we expect it to be solved
911.207	by a few supermen or superwomen.
913.808	Now we need everybody,
917.314	because it is only when we accept
917.314	that everybody has value
923.54	that we will liberate the energy
923.54	and imagination and momentum we need
930.586	to create the best beyond measure.
935.36	Thank you.
938.1	(Applause)
