15.26	When I was nine years old,
17.26	I went off to summer camp
17.26	for the first time.
19.427	And my mother packed me a suitcase
19.427	full of books,
23.26	which to me seemed like
23.26	a perfectly natural thing to do.
25.951	Because in my family,
25.951	reading was the primary group activity.
30.26	And this might sound antisocial to you,
32.26	but for us it was really just
32.26	a different way of being social.
35.26	You have the animal warmth of your family
35.26	sitting right next to you,
39.26	but you are also free to go
39.26	roaming around the adventureland
42.142	inside your own mind.
43.26	And I had this idea
45.26	that camp was going to be
45.26	just like this, but better.
47.808	(Laughter)
50.26	I had a vision of 10 girls
50.26	sitting in a cabin
53.26	cozily reading books
53.26	in their matching nightgowns.
55.665	(Laughter)
57.26	Camp was more like a keg party
57.26	without any alcohol.
60.26	And on the very first day,
63.26	our counselor gathered us all together
65.26	and she taught us a cheer
65.26	that she said we would be doing
67.96	every day for the rest of the summer
67.96	to instill camp spirit.
71.26	And it went like this:
73.26	"""R-O-W-D-I-E,"
75.26	that's the way we spell rowdie.
77.26	"Rowdie, rowdie, let's get rowdie."""
80.677	(Laughter)
82.26	Yeah.
84.26	So I couldn't figure out
84.26	for the life of me
86.332	why we were supposed to be so rowdy,
88.26	or why we had to spell
88.26	this word incorrectly.
91.26	(Laughter)
97.26	But I recited a cheer. I recited
97.26	a cheer along with everybody else.
100.475	I did my best.
102.26	And I just waited for the time
102.26	that I could go off and read my books.
107.82	But the first time that I took
107.82	my book out of my suitcase,
110.644	the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me
112.684	"and she asked me, ""Why"
112.684	"are you being so mellow?"" --"
115.16	mellow, of course,
115.16	being the exact opposite
117.232	of R-O-W-D-I-E.
119.159	And then the second time I tried it,
121.06	the counselor came up to me
121.06	with a concerned expression on her face
124.26	and she repeated the point
124.26	about camp spirit
126.38	and said we should all work very hard
126.38	to be outgoing.
129.614	And so I put my books away,
132.26	back in their suitcase,
135.26	and I put them under my bed,
139.26	and there they stayed
139.26	for the rest of the summer.
141.66	And I felt kind of guilty about this.
143.46	I felt as if the books needed me somehow,
145.46	and they were calling out to me
145.46	and I was forsaking them.
148.26	But I did forsake them
148.26	and I didn't open that suitcase again
151.16	until I was back home with my family
151.16	at the end of the summer.
154.26	Now, I tell you this story
154.26	about summer camp.
157.26	I could have told you
160.26	all the times that I got the message
162.26	that somehow my quiet
162.26	and introverted style of being
166.26	was not necessarily the right way to go,
168.26	that I should be trying to pass
168.26	as more of an extrovert.
171.26	And I always sensed deep down
171.26	that this was wrong
174.26	and that introverts were
174.26	pretty excellent just as they were.
177.142	But for years I denied this intuition,
179.26	and so I became a Wall Street
179.26	lawyer, of all things,
182.26	instead of the writer
182.26	that I had always longed to be --
185.26	partly because I needed to prove to myself
185.26	that I could be bold and assertive too.
189.26	And I was always going off to crowded bars
191.361	when I really would have preferred
191.361	to just have a nice dinner with friends.
194.957	And I made these
194.957	self-negating choices so reflexively,
199.26	that I wasn't even aware
199.26	that I was making them.
202.757	Now this is what many introverts do,
204.56	and it's our loss for sure,
206.26	but it is also our colleagues' loss
208.26	and our communities' loss.
210.26	And at the risk of sounding grandiose,
210.26	it is the world's loss.
213.26	Because when it comes
213.26	to creativity and to leadership,
216.26	we need introverts doing
216.26	what they do best.
219.26	A third to a half of the population
219.26	are introverts --
221.808	a third to a half.
223.26	So that's one out of every two
223.26	or three people you know.
226.26	So even if you're an extrovert yourself,
229.26	I'm talking about your coworkers
231.26	and your spouses and your children
233.26	and the person sitting
233.26	next to you right now --
236.26	all of them subject to this bias
238.26	that is pretty deep
238.26	and real in our society.
240.38	We all internalize it
240.38	from a very early age
243.26	without even having a language
243.26	for what we're doing.
246.26	Now, to see the bias clearly,
248.26	you need to understand
248.26	what introversion is.
251.26	It's different from being shy.
253.26	Shyness is about fear of social judgment.
255.26	Introversion is more about,
257.26	how do you respond to stimulation,
259.26	including social stimulation.
261.26	So extroverts really crave
261.26	large amounts of stimulation,
264.26	whereas introverts feel
264.26	at their most alive
266.361	and their most switched-on
266.361	and their most capable
268.761	when they're in quieter,
268.761	more low-key environments.
271.19	Not all the time --
271.19	these things aren't absolute --
273.643	but a lot of the time.
274.86	So the key then to maximizing our talents
279.26	is for us all to put ourselves
281.26	in the zone of stimulation
281.26	that is right for us.
284.26	But now here's where the bias comes in.
286.26	Our most important institutions,
288.26	our schools and our workplaces,
290.26	they are designed mostly for extroverts
292.26	and for extroverts' need
292.26	for lots of stimulation.
295.26	And also we have
295.26	this belief system right now
299.26	that I call the new groupthink,
301.26	which holds that all creativity
301.26	and all productivity
304.26	comes from a very oddly gregarious place.
309.26	So if you picture the typical
309.26	classroom nowadays:
311.618	When I was going to school,
311.618	we sat in rows.
315.26	We sat in rows of desks like this,
317.26	and we did most of our work
317.26	pretty autonomously.
319.547	But nowadays, your typical classroom
319.547	has pods of desks --
323.26	four or five or six or seven kids
323.26	all facing each other.
326.26	And kids are working
326.26	in countless group assignments.
328.761	Even in subjects like math
328.761	and creative writing,
331.26	which you think would depend
331.26	on solo flights of thought,
334.26	kids are now expected to act
334.26	as committee members.
338.26	And for the kids who prefer to go off
338.26	by themselves or just to work alone,
342.475	those kids are seen as outliers often
344.36	or, worse, as problem cases.
349.006	And the vast majority of teachers
350.906	reports believing that
350.906	the ideal student is an extrovert
353.66	as opposed to an introvert,
355.26	even though introverts
355.26	actually get better grades
357.618	and are more knowledgeable,
359.26	according to research.
361.26	(Laughter)
363.26	Okay, same thing is true
363.26	in our workplaces.
366.26	Now, most of us work in open plan offices,
369.26	without walls,
371.26	where we are subject to the constant
371.26	noise and gaze of our coworkers.
375.57	And when it comes to leadership,
377.26	introverts are routinely passed over
377.26	for leadership positions,
380.26	even though introverts
380.26	tend to be very careful,
382.5	much less likely to take outsize risks --
384.5	which is something
384.5	we might all favor nowadays.
387.26	And interesting research
387.26	by Adam Grant at the Wharton School
390.26	has found that introverted leaders
392.26	often deliver better outcomes
392.26	than extroverts do,
394.618	because when they are managing
394.618	proactive employees,
397.26	they're much more likely to let
397.26	those employees run with their ideas,
400.547	whereas an extrovert
400.547	can, quite unwittingly,
402.667	get so excited about things
404.26	that they're putting
404.26	their own stamp on things,
406.5	and other people's ideas might not
406.5	as easily then bubble up to the surface.
411.26	Now in fact, some of our transformative
411.26	leaders in history have been introverts.
415.06	I'll give you some examples.
416.46	Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks, Gandhi --
419.26	all these peopled described themselves
419.26	as quiet and soft-spoken and even shy.
424.26	And they all took the spotlight,
426.26	even though every bone in their bodies
426.26	was telling them not to.
431.529	And this turns out to have
431.529	a special power all its own,
434.16	because people could feel
434.16	that these leaders were at the helm
437.16	not because they enjoyed directing others
439.16	and not out of the pleasure
439.16	of being looked at;
441.46	they were there
441.46	because they had no choice,
443.532	because they were driven to do
443.532	what they thought was right.
446.728	Now I think at this point
446.728	it's important for me to say
449.36	that I actually love extroverts.
452.26	I always like to say some of my best
452.26	friends are extroverts,
455.26	including my beloved husband.
459.26	And we all fall
459.26	at different points, of course,
461.523	along the introvert/extrovert spectrum.
464.26	Even Carl Jung, the psychologist
464.26	who first popularized these terms,
467.69	said that there's no such thing
467.69	as a pure introvert
470.105	or a pure extrovert.
471.46	He said that such a man
471.46	would be in a lunatic asylum,
474.008	if he existed at all.
476.26	And some people fall smack in the middle
476.26	of the introvert/extrovert spectrum,
480.26	and we call these people ambiverts.
482.26	And I often think that they have
482.26	the best of all worlds.
486.259	But many of us do recognize
486.259	ourselves as one type or the other.
489.26	And what I'm saying is that culturally,
489.26	we need a much better balance.
492.57	We need more of a yin and yang
492.57	between these two types.
496.26	This is especially important
498.26	when it comes to creativity
498.26	and to productivity,
500.57	because when psychologists look
500.57	at the lives of the most creative people,
504.26	what they find
506.26	are people who are very good
506.26	at exchanging ideas
508.57	and advancing ideas,
510.26	but who also have a serious
510.26	streak of introversion in them.
513.26	And this is because solitude
515.513	is a crucial ingredient
515.513	often to creativity.
517.66	So Darwin,
519.26	he took long walks alone in the woods
521.26	and emphatically turned down
521.26	dinner-party invitations.
524.26	Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss,
527.26	he dreamed up many
527.26	of his amazing creations
529.309	in a lonely bell tower office that he had
531.309	in the back of his house
531.309	in La Jolla, California.
534.26	And he was actually afraid to meet
534.26	the young children who read his books
538.26	for fear that they were expecting him
538.26	this kind of jolly Santa Claus-like figure
542.284	and would be disappointed
542.284	with his more reserved persona.
546.26	Steve Wozniak invented
546.26	the first Apple computer
548.523	sitting alone in his cubicle
548.523	in Hewlett-Packard
551.544	where he was working at the time.
553.205	And he says that he never would have
553.205	become such an expert in the first place
556.904	had he not been too introverted
556.904	to leave the house
559.36	when he was growing up.
561.068	Now, of course,
563.26	this does not mean that we should
563.26	all stop collaborating --
566.26	and case in point, is Steve Wozniak
566.26	famously coming together with Steve Jobs
569.904	to start Apple Computer --
572.26	but it does mean that solitude matters
575.26	and that for some people
575.26	it is the air that they breathe.
579.26	And in fact, we have known for centuries
579.26	about the transcendent power of solitude.
585.26	It's only recently that
585.26	we've strangely begun to forget it.
588.26	If you look at most
588.26	of the world's major religions,
591.26	you will find seekers --
593.26	Moses, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad --
596.26	seekers who are going off by themselves
596.26	alone to the wilderness,
600.26	where they then have profound
600.26	epiphanies and revelations
602.96	that they then bring back
602.96	to the rest of the community.
605.66	So, no wilderness, no revelations.
609.26	This is no surprise, though,
611.26	if you look at the insights
611.26	of contemporary psychology.
614.26	It turns out that we can't
614.26	even be in a group of people
617.26	without instinctively mirroring,
617.26	mimicking their opinions.
620.26	Even about seemingly
620.26	personal and visceral things
622.618	like who you're attracted to,
624.26	you will start aping the beliefs
624.26	of the people around you
627.26	without even realizing
627.26	that that's what you're doing.
629.808	And groups famously follow the opinions
632.26	of the most dominant
632.26	or charismatic person in the room,
634.96	even though there's zero correlation
636.76	between being the best talker
636.76	and having the best ideas --
639.56	I mean zero.
641.26	So --
643.26	(Laughter)
645.26	You might be following the person
645.26	with the best ideas,
648.26	but you might not.
650.26	And do you really want
650.26	to leave it up to chance?
653.26	Much better for everybody
653.26	to go off by themselves,
655.665	generate their own ideas
657.26	freed from the distortions
657.26	of group dynamics,
659.427	and then come together as a team
661.26	to talk them through
661.26	in a well-managed environment
664.26	and take it from there.
666.26	Now if all this is true,
668.26	then why are we getting it so wrong?
671.26	Why are we setting up our schools
671.26	this way, and our workplaces?
674.26	And why are we making
674.26	these introverts feel so guilty
676.808	about wanting to just go off
676.808	by themselves some of the time?
679.76	One answer lies deep
679.76	in our cultural history.
682.26	Western societies,
684.26	and in particular the U.S.,
686.26	have always favored the man of action
686.26	"over the ""man"" of contemplation."
694.26	But in America's early days,
697.26	we lived in what historians
697.26	call a culture of character,
700.26	where we still,
700.26	at that point, valued people
702.38	for their inner selves
702.38	and their moral rectitude.
705.26	And if you look at the self-help
705.26	books from this era,
707.86	they all had titles with things like
709.66	"""Character, the Grandest"
709.66	"Thing in the World."""
712.26	And they featured role models
712.26	like Abraham Lincoln,
715.26	who was praised for being
715.26	modest and unassuming.
717.57	Ralph Waldo Emerson called him
719.26	"""A man who does not"
719.26	"offend by superiority."""
722.26	But then we hit the 20th century,
725.26	and we entered a new culture
727.26	that historians call
727.26	the culture of personality.
729.547	What happened is we had evolved
729.547	an agricultural economy
732.247	to a world of big business.
733.66	And so suddenly people are moving
733.66	from small towns to the cities.
737.26	And instead of working alongside people
737.26	they've known all their lives,
740.595	now they are having to prove themselves
740.595	in a crowd of strangers.
744.26	So, quite understandably,
746.26	qualities like magnetism and charisma
746.26	suddenly come to seem really important.
750.26	And sure enough, the self-help books
750.26	change to meet these new needs
753.475	and they start to have names
755.26	"like ""How to Win Friends"
755.26	"and Influence People."""
757.5	And they feature as their role models
757.5	really great salesmen.
762.26	So that's the world we're living in today.
764.284	That's our cultural inheritance.
768.26	Now none of this is to say
768.26	that social skills are unimportant,
773.26	and I'm also not calling
773.26	for the abolishing of teamwork at all.
778.26	The same religions who send their sages
778.26	off to lonely mountain tops
781.475	also teach us love and trust.
784.26	And the problems that we are facing today
786.26	in fields like science and in economics
788.26	are so vast and so complex
790.26	that we are going to need armies
790.26	of people coming together
793.06	to solve them working together.
794.66	But I am saying that the more freedom
794.66	that we give introverts to be themselves,
798.46	the more likely that they are
799.96	to come up with their own unique
799.96	solutions to these problems.
804.26	So now I'd like to share with you
804.26	what's in my suitcase today.
813.26	Guess what?
815.26	Books.
817.26	I have a suitcase full of books.
819.26	"Here's Margaret Atwood, ""Cat's Eye."""
821.26	Here's a novel by Milan Kundera.
824.26	"And here's ""The Guide for the Perplexed"""
824.26	by Maimonides.
829.26	But these are not exactly my books.
832.26	I brought these books with me
834.26	because they were written
834.26	by my grandfather's favorite authors.
838.26	My grandfather was a rabbi
840.26	and he was a widower
842.26	who lived alone in a small
842.26	apartment in Brooklyn
845.26	that was my favorite place
845.26	in the world when I was growing up,
848.26	partly because it was filled with
848.26	his very gentle, very courtly presence
851.713	and partly because
851.713	it was filled with books.
854.26	I mean literally every table,
854.26	every chair in this apartment
857.26	had yielded its original function
859.26	to now serve as a surface
859.26	for swaying stacks of books.
862.26	Just like the rest of my family,
864.26	my grandfather's favorite thing to do
864.26	in the whole world was to read.
867.57	But he also loved his congregation,
870.26	and you could feel this love
870.26	in the sermons that he gave
873.26	every week for the 62 years
873.26	that he was a rabbi.
877.26	He would takes the fruits
877.26	of each week's reading
880.26	and he would weave
881.596	these intricate tapestries
881.596	of ancient and humanist thought.
884.461	And people would come from all over
884.461	to hear him speak.
887.963	But here's the thing about my grandfather.
891.327	Underneath this ceremonial role,
892.96	he was really modest
892.96	and really introverted --
895.26	so much so that when
895.26	he delivered these sermons,
898.26	he had trouble making eye contact
900.26	with the very same congregation
900.26	that he had been speaking to for 62 years.
904.284	And even away from the podium,
906.26	when you called him to say hello,
908.26	he would often end
908.26	the conversation prematurely
910.523	for fear that he was taking up
910.523	too much of your time.
914.26	But when he died at the age of 94,
917.26	the police had to close down
917.26	the streets of his neighborhood
920.26	to accommodate the crowd of people
920.26	who came out to mourn him.
927.106	And so these days I try to learn
927.106	from my grandfather's example
930.16	in my own way.
931.56	So I just published a book
931.56	about introversion,
934.26	and it took me about seven years to write.
936.284	And for me, that seven years
936.284	was like total bliss,
939.26	because I was reading, I was writing,
942.26	I was thinking, I was researching.
944.26	It was my version
946.26	of my grandfather's hours
946.26	of the day alone in his library.
949.26	But now all of a sudden
949.26	my job is very different,
952.26	and my job is to be
952.26	out here talking about it,
955.26	talking about introversion.
958.26	(Laughter)
962.26	And that's a lot harder for me,
964.26	because as honored as I am
964.26	to be here with all of you right now,
968.26	this is not my natural milieu.
971.26	So I prepared for moments
971.26	like these as best I could.
975.26	I spent the last year
975.26	practicing public speaking
977.57	every chance I could get.
979.26	"And I call this my ""year"
979.26	"of speaking dangerously."""
982.26	(Laughter)
984.26	And that actually helped a lot.
986.26	But I'll tell you, what helps even more
988.26	is my sense, my belief, my hope
988.26	that when it comes to our attitudes
993.26	to introversion and to quiet
993.26	and to solitude,
995.404	we truly are poised on the brink
995.404	on dramatic change.
997.905	I mean, we are.
999.26	And so I am going to leave you now
1001.26	with three calls for action
1001.26	for those who share this vision.
1005.26	Number one:
1007.26	Stop the madness for constant group work.
1009.26	Just stop it.
1011.26	(Laughter)
1014.26	Thank you.
1016.26	(Applause)
1018.26	And I want to be clear
1018.26	about what I'm saying,
1020.427	because I deeply believe our offices
1022.26	should be encouraging casual, chatty
1022.26	cafe-style types of interactions --
1026.26	you know, the kind
1026.26	where people come together
1028.404	and serendipitously have
1028.404	an exchange of ideas.
1030.619	That is great.
1032.26	It's great for introverts
1032.26	and it's great for extroverts.
1034.96	But we need much more privacy
1034.96	and much more freedom
1037.413	and much more autonomy at work.
1038.96	School, same thing.
1040.26	We need to be teaching kids
1040.26	to work together, for sure,
1043.26	but we also need to be teaching them
1043.26	how to work on their own.
1046.26	This is especially important
1046.26	for extroverted children too.
1049.06	They need to work on their own
1050.56	because that is where deep thought
1050.56	comes from in part.
1053.156	Okay, number two: Go to the wilderness.
1055.26	Be like Buddha, have your own revelations.
1058.26	I'm not saying
1060.26	that we all have to now go off and build
1060.26	our own cabins in the woods
1063.523	and never talk to each other again,
1066.26	but I am saying that we could
1066.26	all stand to unplug
1068.618	and get inside our own heads
1068.618	a little more often.
1074.26	Number three:
1077.26	Take a good look
1077.26	at what's inside your own suitcase
1079.713	and why you put it there.
1081.26	So extroverts,
1083.26	maybe your suitcases
1083.26	are also full of books.
1085.357	Or maybe they're full of champagne glasses
1085.357	or skydiving equipment.
1090.26	Whatever it is, I hope you take
1090.26	these things out every chance you get
1094.26	and grace us with your energy
1094.26	and your joy.
1097.26	But introverts, you being you,
1100.26	you probably have the impulse
1100.26	to guard very carefully
1102.838	what's inside your own suitcase.
1104.738	And that's okay.
1106.26	But occasionally, just occasionally,
1108.26	I hope you will open up your suitcases
1108.26	for other people to see,
1111.284	because the world needs you and it
1111.284	needs the things you carry.
1116.26	So I wish you the best
1116.26	of all possible journeys
1118.523	and the courage to speak softly.
1121.26	Thank you very much.
1123.26	(Applause)
1127.26	Thank you. Thank you.
1130.26	(Applause)
