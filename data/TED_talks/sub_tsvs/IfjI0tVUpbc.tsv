12.817	I have been a police officer
12.817	for a very, very long time.
15.492	And you see these notes in my hand
15.492	because I'm also a black preacher.
21.305	(Laughter)
23.012	And if you know anything
23.012	about black preachers,
25.251	we'll close, and then we'll keep
25.251	going for another 20 minutes.
28.487	(Laughter)
29.548	So I need this to keep
29.548	pushing this thing forward.
31.965	I've been a police officer
31.965	for a very long time,
34.238	and I mean I predated technology.
35.842	I'm talking about before pagers.
37.462	(Laughter)
38.719	Laugh if you want to,
38.719	but I'm telling the truth.
41.004	I predate War on Our Fellow Man --
41.004	I mean, War on Drugs.
45.73	I predate all of that.
47.855	I predate so much
49.033	and I've been through ebbs and flows
50.84	and I've been through good and bad times,
53.231	and still I absolutely love
53.231	being a police officer.
58.207	I love being a police officer
58.207	because it's always been a calling for me
61.982	and never a job.
64.219	And even with that,
66.538	my personal truth is that
66.538	law enforcement is in a crisis.
71.616	It's an invisible crisis,
73.154	and it has been for many, many years.
76.787	Even though we in law enforcement say,
78.68	"""You know what?"
78.68	"We can't arrest our way out of this."""
83.258	We say in law enforcement things like,
85.093	"""Yeah, it's illegal to profile."""
88.008	You know what?
89.19	In law enforcement, we even agree
89.19	that we have to adopt this thinking
92.572	and become more oriented
92.572	to community policing.
94.801	And yet all the while, still,
97.735	we continue in the same vein,
99.956	the same vein that contradicts
99.956	everything that we just admitted.
105.131	And so that's the reason for me,
105.131	several years ago.
108.313	Because I was tired of the racism,
108.313	I was tired of discrimination,
111.432	"I was tired of the ""-isms"""
111.432	and the schisms.
114.049	I was just so tired.
115.904	I was tired of the vicious cycle,
118.081	and I was tired of it even
118.081	in the beloved agency
121.334	in the department that I still love today.
124.771	And so my wife and I, we sat down
126.924	and we decided and we targeted
126.924	a date that we would retire.
130.13	We would retire and I would
130.13	go off into the sunset,
132.758	maybe do ministry full time,
132.758	love my wife a long time.
135.615	Y'all know what I'm talking about.
137.28	(Laughter)
138.709	But we decided that I would retire.
140.456	But then there was a higher power than I.
144.492	There was a love for the city
147.384	that I loved, that I grew up in,
147.384	that I was educated in --
150.609	a city that pulled my heart
150.609	back into the system.
154.959	So we didn't retire.
156.916	We didn't retire
158.334	and so what happened was,
160.822	over the next -- I would say,
165.05	I had this passion to implement
165.05	some radical policing.
169.393	And so now, over the next 19 months,
171.148	I shifted, and I transcended
171.148	from being a drug sergeant --
176.277	ready to retire as a drug sergeant --
178.865	and went from level to level to level,
180.723	until I find myself
180.723	as a district commander,
183.176	commander of the worst district
183.176	in Baltimore city.
186.453	We call it the Eastern District,
188.178	the most violent district,
189.812	the most impoverished district --
196.018	National rating at that time,
198.262	national rating, the AIDS
198.262	and the tuberculosis [rating],
201.258	was always on the top 10 list
203.683	for zip codes for cities
203.683	across the nation,
206.73	or just zip codes across the nation.
208.493	The top 10 -- I didn't say state,
208.493	I didn't say city --
211.135	that little neighborhood.
213.911	And I said, you know what?
213.911	We gotta do something different.
216.738	We gotta do something different.
216.738	We gotta think radical.
219.422	We gotta think outside the box.
221.73	And so in order to bring change
221.73	that I desperately wanted
224.436	and I desperately felt in my heart,
226.167	I had to start listening
226.167	to that inner spirit.
228.48	I had to start listening
228.48	to that man on the inside
230.937	that went against everything
230.937	that I had been trained to do.
234.772	But we still did it.
236.19	We still did it because we listened
236.19	to that inner spirit,
238.911	because I realized this:
240.196	if I was to see real police reform
244.269	in the communities that I had
244.269	authority over for public safety,
248.69	we had to change our stinkin' thinkin'.
252.728	We had to change it.
253.905	And so what we did
253.905	is we started to think holistically
256.652	and not paramilitarily.
258.538	So we thought differently.
260.819	And we started to realize
262.042	that it could never be
262.042	and never should have been
264.376	us versus them.
266.91	And so I decided to come
266.91	to that intersection
269.142	where I could meet all classes,
269.142	all races, all creeds, all colors;
272.387	where I would meet the businesses
272.387	and the faith-based,
274.952	and the eds, the meds,
276.262	and I would meet all the people
277.794	that made up the communities
277.794	that I had authority over.
281.205	So I met them and I began to listen.
283.189	See, police have a problem.
284.665	Off the top, we want to bring
284.665	things into the community
287.284	and come up with these extravagant
287.284	strategies and deployments,
290.276	but we never talk
290.276	to the community about them.
292.475	And we shove them into the community
292.475	"and say, ""Take that."""
295.806	But we said we'd get rid
295.806	of that stinkin' thinkin',
298.227	so we talked to our communities.
299.799	"We said, ""This is your community table."
301.691	We'll pull up a chair.
301.691	We want to hear from you.
303.978	"What's going to work in your community?"""
305.942	And then some great things
305.942	started to happen.
308.095	See, here's the thing:
309.27	I had to figure out a way to shift
315.014	from being occupiers of communities
317.15	to being partners.
319.355	I had to figure out how to do that.
321.071	Because here's the crazy thing:
323.074	in law enforcement, we have evolved
323.074	into something incredible.
326.743	Listen, we have become great protectors.
328.704	We know how to protect you.
330.909	But we have exercised that arm
330.909	so much, so very much.
334.972	If I was a natural police department
338.162	and I represented a police department,
340.067	you would see this incredible,
340.067	beautiful, 23-inch arm.
342.98	(Laughter)
345.607	It's pretty, ain't it? It's cut up.
348.641	No fat on it. Mmm it look good.
348.641	It just look good!
351.592	(Laughter)
353.75	That's a great arm -- protection!
355.675	That's who we are, but we've exercised
355.675	it so much sometimes
359.255	that it has led to abuse.
362.008	It's led to coldness and callousness
362.008	and dehumanized us.
366.941	And we've forgotten
368.117	the mantra across this nation
369.554	is to protect and serve.
372.068	Y'all don't know that? Protect and serve.
374.068	(Laughter)
375.093	So you look at the other arm,
376.522	and then you look at it
376.522	and ... there it is.
378.681	(Laughter)
380.267	You know, it's kinda weak.
382.926	It looks sickly.
384.972	It's withering and it's dying
387.861	because we've invested so much
387.861	in our protective arm.
391.302	But we forgot to treat our communities
394.183	like they're our customers;
396.026	like they're our sons and daughters,
396.026	our brothers and sisters,
399.015	our mothers and fathers.
400.6	And so somehow, along the way,
402.873	we've gotten out of balance.
404.958	And because we are a proud profession,
407.952	it is very hard for us to look
407.952	in the mirror and see our mistakes.
411.117	It's even harder to make a change.
413.775	And so, as I try to hurry
413.775	and get through this,
417.204	I need to say this:
418.389	it's not just law enforcement, though.
420.818	Because every one of us
420.818	makes up a community.
423.674	Everybody makes up a community.
425.678	And as communities -- can I say this? --
427.63	we have put too much responsibility
427.63	on law enforcement.
432.261	Too much.
433.443	(Applause)
438.706	And then we have the audacity
438.706	and the nerve to get upset
441.377	with law enforcement
441.377	when we take action.
444.265	There is no way in the world
446.615	that we, as a community,
446.615	should be calling the police
450.182	for kids playing ball in the street.
454.071	No way in the world that we
454.071	should be calling the police
456.831	because my neighbor's
456.831	music is up too loud,
458.941	because his dog came over
458.941	to my yard and did a number two;
461.719	there's no way we should
461.719	be calling the police.
464.264	But we have surrendered
464.264	so much of our responsibility.
466.93	Listen, when I was a little boy
466.93	coming up in Baltimore --
470.088	and listen, we played
470.088	rough in the street --
472.249	I ain't never see the police
472.249	come and break us up.
475.026	You know who came? It was the elders.
476.975	It was the parental figures
476.975	in the community.
479.44	It was those guardians,
479.44	it was that village mentality.
482.051	"They came and said, ""Stop that!"""
482.051	"and ""Do this."" and ""Stop that."""
485.689	We had mentors throughout
485.689	all of the community.
489.769	So it takes all of us, all of us.
492.62	And when I say community,
493.844	I'm talking about everything
493.844	that makes up a community, even --
496.895	listen, because I'm a preacher,
496.895	I'm very hard on the churches,
499.85	because I believe the churches
499.85	too often have become MIA,
502.621	missing in action.
503.802	I believe they have shifted
503.802	over the last 10, 20 years
506.394	from being community churches,
507.894	where you walk outside your door,
507.894	round the corner and you're in church.
511.386	They shifted from that and became
511.386	commuter churches.
514.27	So you now have churches who have
514.27	become disconnected by default
518.754	from the very community
518.754	where they're planted.
522.06	And they don't take care
522.06	of that community.
525.153	I could go on and on,
525.153	but I really need to wrap this up.
527.845	Community and policing:
530.52	we've all lost that precious gift,
530.52	and I call it relational equity.
535.498	We've lost it with one another.
537.445	It's not somebody else's fault --
539.484	it's all of our fault.
541.371	We all take responsibility in this.
543.361	But I say this: it's not too late
543.361	for all of us to build our cities
546.586	and nation to make it great again.
548.248	It is never too late.
549.431	It is never too late.
551.428	You see, after three years
552.853	of my four-and-a-half-year
552.853	commandship in that district,
556.115	three years in,
557.293	after putting pastors
557.293	in the car with my police
559.996	because I knew this --
559.996	it's a little secret --
562.195	I knew this:
563.378	it was hard to stay a nasty police officer
566.067	while you're riding around
566.067	with a clergy.
568.192	(Laughter)
570.398	(Applause)
578.476	You'd be getting in and out of the car,
578.476	looking to your right, talking about:
582.029	"""Father, forgive me, for I have sinned,"""
582.029	all day long -- you can't do it!
585.589	So we came up with some
585.589	incredible initiatives,
587.866	engagements for our community
587.866	and police to build that trust back.
591.385	We began to deal with our youth
592.968	and with those who we consider
592.968	are on the wrong side of the fence.
596.17	We knew we had an economic problem,
597.927	so we began to create jobs.
599.443	We knew there was sickness
599.443	in our community
601.515	and they didn't have access
601.515	to proper medical care,
604.033	so we'd partner up.
605.216	We got to that intersection
605.216	and partnered up
607.313	with anybody that wanted
607.313	to partner with us
609.424	and talked about
609.424	what we needed holistically,
611.615	never thinking about the crime.
613.152	Because at the end of the day,
614.871	if we took care
614.871	of the needs of the people,
616.958	if we got to the root cause,
619.251	the crime would take care of itself.
622.599	It would take care of itself.
624.089	(Applause)
629.897	And so, after three years
629.897	of a four-and-a-half-year stint,
634.665	we looked back and we looked over
636.365	and found out that we were
636.365	at a 40-year historical low:
639.754	our crime numbers, our homicides --
642.659	everything had dropped
642.659	down, back to the 1970s.
645.14	And it might go back further,
646.58	but the problem is, we only
646.58	started keeping data since 1970.
649.521	Forty-year crime low, so much so,
649.521	I had other commanders call me,
652.641	"""Hey Mel, whatcha doin', man?"
654.082	"Whatcha doin'? We gotta get some of that!"""
656.21	(Laughter)
657.649	And so we gave them some of that.
660.968	And in a short period of time,
662.444	the city went to a 30-year crime low.
665.181	For the first time in 30 years,
665.181	we fell, Baltimore city,
667.854	to under 200 homicides -- 197 to be exact.
670.242	And we celebrated,
671.425	because we had learned
671.425	to become great servers,
675.132	become great servers first.
676.893	But I gotta tell you this:
676.893	these last few years,
680.607	as much as we had learned
682.856	to become great proactive police officers
685.827	and great relational police officers
685.827	rather than reactive,
689.612	these last years have disappointed me.
692.71	They have broken my heart.
694.644	The uprising still hurts.
697.584	It still hurts my heart,
699.294	because truly I believe
699.294	that it should've never happened.
703.014	I believe it should've never happened
704.831	if we were allowed to continue
704.831	along the vein that we were in,
707.799	servicing our community,
709.503	treating them like human beings,
709.503	treating them with respect,
712.463	loving on them first.
714.67	If we continued in that vein,
716.854	it would've never happened.
718.727	But somehow, we went back
718.727	to business as usual.
721.956	But I'm excited again!
724.164	I'm excited again, because now
724.164	we have a police commissioner
727.533	who not only talks
727.533	about community policing,
731.8	but he absolutely understands it,
734.142	and more importantly, he embraces it.
736.238	So I'm very excited now.
737.981	Listen, I'm excited about Baltimore today,
740.954	because we, as many cities,
740.954	I believe shall rise from the ashes.
745.973	I believe -- I truly believe --
748.886	(Applause)
749.932	that we will be great again.
752.639	I believe,
754.47	as we continue to wrap arms
754.47	and continue to say,
757.565	"""We're in this together,"""
758.787	because it's not just an intersection:
760.654	once we meet, we now gotta get
760.654	on the same path for the same goals,
764.312	and this city will become great again.
766.384	This nation will become great again.
768.369	Because we have the same goal:
768.369	we all want peace.
770.812	We all want respect for one another.
772.57	We all want love.
773.744	And I believe we are back on that road,
775.66	and I'm so excited about it.
777.054	So listen, I thank you for giving me
777.054	a few minutes of your time.
780.426	God bless you all.
781.68	(Applause)
782.705	God bless you.
783.88	(Applause)
