12	I'm going to speak
14	about a tiny, little idea.
17	And this is about shifting baseline.
21	And because the idea can be explained in one minute,
25	I will tell you three stories before
28	to fill in the time.
30	And the first story
32	is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
35	And he was here, as you well know, in '35.
38	And you'd think he was chasing finches,
40	but he wasn't.
42	He was actually collecting fish.
44	And he described one of them
46	"as very ""common."""
48	This was the sailfin grouper.
50	A big fishery was run on it
52	until the '80s.
55	Now the fish is on the IUCN Red List.
58	Now this story,
60	we have heard it lots of times
63	on Galapagos and other places,
65	so there is nothing particular about it.
68	But the point is, we still come to Galapagos.
71	We still think it is pristine.
74	The brochures still say
77	it is untouched.
79	So what happens here?
82	The second story, also to illustrate another concept,
85	is called shifting waistline.
87	(Laughter)
90	Because I was there in '71,
92	studying a lagoon in West Africa.
94	I was there because I grew up in Europe
97	and I wanted later to work in Africa.
99	And I thought I could blend in.
101	And I got a big sunburn,
103	and I was convinced that I was really not from there.
106	This was my first sunburn.
108	And the lagoon
111	was surrounded by palm trees,
113	as you can see, and a few mangrove.
115	And it had tilapia
117	about 20 centimeters,
119	a species of tilapia called blackchin tilapia.
121	And the fisheries for this tilapia
123	sustained lots of fish and they had a good time
126	and they earned more than average
128	in Ghana.
130	When I went there 27 years later,
133	the fish had shrunk to half of their size.
136	They were maturing at five centimeters.
138	They had been pushed genetically.
140	There were still fishes.
142	They were still kind of happy.
144	And the fish also were happy to be there.
149	So nothing has changed,
151	but everything has changed.
153	My third little story
155	is that I was an accomplice
157	in the introduction of trawling
159	in Southeast Asia.
161	In the '70s -- well, beginning in the '60s --
164	Europe did lots of development projects.
167	Fish development
169	meant imposing on countries
171	that had already 100,000 fishers
174	to impose on them industrial fishing.
177	And this boat, quite ugly,
179	is called the Mutiara 4.
181	And I went sailing on it,
183	and we did surveys
186	throughout the southern South China sea
189	and especially the Java Sea.
191	And what we caught,
193	we didn't have words for it.
195	What we caught, I know now,
198	is the bottom of the sea.
200	And 90 percent of our catch
202	were sponges,
204	other animals that are fixed on the bottom.
207	And actually most of the fish,
209	they are a little spot on the debris,
211	the piles of debris, were coral reef fish.
214	Essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck
216	and then was thrown down.
218	And these pictures are extraordinary
221	because this transition is very rapid.
224	Within a year, you do a survey
227	and then commercial fishing begins.
229	The bottom is transformed
231	from, in this case, a hard bottom or soft coral
234	into a muddy mess.
237	This is a dead turtle.
239	They were not eaten, they were thrown away because they were dead.
242	And one time we caught a live one.
244	It was not drowned yet.
246	And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat.
249	This mountain of debris
252	is actually collected by fishers
255	every time they go
257	into an area that's never been fished.
259	But it's not documented.
261	We transform the world,
263	but we don't remember it.
265	We adjust our baseline
268	to the new level,
270	and we don't recall what was there.
274	If you generalize this,
276	something like this happens.
278	You have on the y axis some good thing:
281	biodiversity, numbers of orca,
284	the greenness of your country, the water supply.
287	And over time it changes --
289	it changes
291	because people do things, or naturally.
293	Every generation
295	will use the images
297	that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives
300	as a standard
302	and will extrapolate forward.
304	And the difference then,
306	they perceive as a loss.
308	But they don't perceive what happened before as a loss.
311	You can have a succession of changes.
313	At the end you want to sustain
316	miserable leftovers.
319	And that, to a large extent, is what we want to do now.
322	We want to sustain things that are gone
325	or things that are not the way they were.
329	Now one should think
331	this problem affected people
333	certainly when in predatory societies,
337	they killed animals
339	and they didn't know they had done so
341	after a few generations.
343	Because, obviously,
346	an animal that is very abundant,
351	before it gets extinct,
354	it becomes rare.
357	So you don't lose abundant animals.
360	You always lose rare animals.
362	And therefore they're not perceived
364	as a big loss.
366	Over time,
368	we concentrate on large animals,
370	and in a sea that means the big fish.
372	They become rarer because we fish them.
375	Over time we have a few fish left
377	and we think this is the baseline.
380	And the question is,
382	why do people accept this?
387	Well because they don't know that it was different.
390	And in fact, lots of people, scientists,
393	will contest that it was really different.
395	And they will contest this
397	because the evidence
399	presented in an earlier mode
404	is not in the way
407	they would like the evidence presented.
409	For example,
411	the anecdote that some present,
413	as Captain so-and-so
415	observed lots of fish in this area
418	cannot be used
420	or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists,
423	"because it's not ""scientific."""
425	So you have a situation
427	where people don't know the past,
430	even though we live in literate societies,
433	because they don't trust
435	the sources of the past.
438	And hence, the enormous role
441	that a marine protected area can play.
443	Because with marine protected areas,
446	we actually recreate the past.
450	We recreate the past that people cannot conceive
453	because the baseline has shifted
455	and is extremely low.
457	That is for people
459	who can see a marine protected area
464	and who can benefit
466	from the insight that it provides,
469	which enables them to reset their baseline.
473	How about the people who can't do that
475	because they have no access --
477	the people in the Midwest for example?
480	There I think
482	that the arts and film
484	can perhaps fill the gap,
486	and simulation.
488	This is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay.
491	There were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay a long time ago --
495	And you will have noticed that the hues and tones
498	"are like ""Avatar."""
500	(Laughter)
502	"And if you think about ""Avatar,"""
504	if you think of why people were so touched by it --
507	never mind the Pocahontas story --
511	why so touched by the imagery?
515	Because it evokes something
518	that in a sense has been lost.
520	And so my recommendation,
522	it's the only one I will provide,
524	"is for Cameron to do ""Avatar II"" underwater."
529	Thank you very much.
531	(Applause)
