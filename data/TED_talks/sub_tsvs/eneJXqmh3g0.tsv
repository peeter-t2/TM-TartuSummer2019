27	I am known best for human-powered flight,
32	but that was just one thing that got me going
37	in the sort of things that I'm working in now.
41	As a youngster, I was very interested in model airplanes,
47	ornithopters, autogyros, helicopters, gliders, power planes,
53	indoor models, outdoor models, everything,
56	which I just thought was a lot of fun,
59	and wondered why most other people didn't share my same enthusiasm with them.
67	And then, navy pilot training, and, after college,
73	I got into sailplane flying, power plane flying,
77	and considered the sailplanes as a sort of hobby and fun,
85	but got tangled up with some great professor types,
89	who convinced me and everybody else in the field
94	that this was a good way to get into really deep science.
99	While this was all going on, I was in the field of weather modification,
105	although getting a Ph.D. in aeronautics.
109	The weather modification subject was getting started,
113	and as a graduate student,
115	I could go around to the various talks that were being given,
119	on a hitchhiker ride to the East Coast,
121	and so on. And everybody would talk to me,
124	but all the professionals in the field hated each other,
127	and they wouldn't communicate. And as a result,
130	I got the absolutely unique background in that field,
135	and started a company, which did more research
139	in weather modification than anybody,
143	and there are a lot of things that I just can't go into.
149	But then, 1971 started AeroVironment, with no employees --
155	then one or two, three,
157	and sort of fumbled along on trying to get interesting projects.
161	We had AirDynamisis,
163	who, like I, did not want to work for aerospace companies
168	on some big, many year project,
172	and so we did our small projects, and the company slowly grew.
181	The thing that is exciting was, in 1976,
186	I suddenly got interested in the human-powered airplane
191	because I'd made a made a loan to a friend of 100,000 dollars,
195	or I guaranteed the money at the bank.
197	He needed them -- he needed the money for starting a company.
201	The company did not succeed, and he couldn't pay the money back,
204	and I was the guarantor of the note. So, I had a $100,000 debt,
209	and I noticed that the Kramer prize for human-powered flight,
215	which had then been around for -- (Laughter) --
222	which, at the exchange rate, was just about 100,000 dollars.
226	So suddenly, I was interested in human-powered flight --
229	(Laughter) --
232	and did not -- the way I approached it, first,
238	thinking about ways to make the planes,
241	was just like they'd been doing in England, and not succeeding,
246	and I gave it up. I figured, nah, there isn't any simple, easy way.
250	But then, got off on a vacation trip, and was studying bird flight,
256	just for the fun of it,
258	and you can watch a bird soaring around in circles,
261	and measure the time, and estimate the bank angle,
265	and immediately, figure out its speed,
268	and the turning radius, and so on,
271	which I could do in the car, as we're driving along on a vacation trip --
276	(Laughter) --
278	with my three sons, young sons, helping me,
282	but ridiculing the whole thing very much.
286	But that began thinking about how birds went around,
291	and then how airplanes would, how hang gliders would fly,
298	and then other planes,
300	and the idea of the Gossamer-Condor-type airplane quickly emerged,
306	was so logical, one should have thought of it in the first place,
309	but one didn't. And it was just, keep the weight down --
320	but three times the span, three times the cord.
322	You're down to a third of the speed, a third of the power,
325	and a good bicyclist can put out that power, and that worked,
332	and we won the prize a year later.
337	We didn't -- a lot of flying, a lot of experiments, a lot of things that didn't work,
343	and ones that did work, and the plane kept getting a little better, a little better.
348	Got a good pilot, Brian Allen, to operate it,
351	and finally, succeeded. But unfortunately,
355	about 65,000 dollars was spent on the project.
359	(Laughter)
361	And there was only about 30 to help retire the debt.
365	But fortunately, Henry Kramer, who put up the prize for --
369	that was a one-mile flight -- put up a new prize
371	for flying the English Channel, 21 miles.
374	And he thought it would take another 18 years for somebody to win that.
378	We realized that if you just cleaned up our Gossamer Condor a little bit,
384	the power to fly would be decreased a little bit,
388	and if you decrease the power required a little,
391	the pilot can fly a much longer period of time.
394	And Brian Allen was able, in a miraculous flight,
398	to get the Gossamer Albatross across the English Channel,
402	and we won the 100,000-pound, 200,000-dollar prize for that.
409	And when all expenses were paid, the debt was handled, and everything was fine.
417	It turned out that giving the planes to the museum
420	was worth much more than the debt,
424	so for five years, six years, I only had to pay one third income tax.
431	So, there were good economic reasons for the project, but --
436	(Laughter) --
439	that's not, well, the project was done entirely for economic reasons,
446	and we have not been involved in any human-powered flight since then --
450	(Laughter) --
452	because the prizes are all over.
456	(Laughter)
457	But that sure started me thinking about various things,
461	and immediately, we began making a solar-powered plane
466	because we felt solar power was going to be so important
469	for the country and the world,
471	we didn't want the small funding in the government to be decreased,
476	which is what the government was trying to do with it.
478	And we thought a solar-powered plane wouldn't really make sense,
483	but you could do it and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power
487	and maybe help that field.
489	And that project continued, did succeed,
493	and we then got into other projects in aviation
499	and mechanical things and ground devices.
507	But while this was going on,
510	in 1982, I got a prize from the Lindbergh Foundation --
515	their annual prize --
517	and I had to prepare a paper on it,
521	which collected all my varied thoughts
524	and varied interests over the years.
526	This was the one chance that I had to focus on what I, really, was after,
531	and what was important. And to my surprise,
535	I realized the importance of environmental issues,
540	which Charles Lindbergh devoted the last third of his life to,
545	and preparing that paper did me a lot of good.
551	I thought back about if I was a space traveler,
554	and came and visited Earth every 5,000 years.
557	And for a few thousand visits, I would see the same thing every time,
564	the little differences in the Earth.
566	But this last time, just coming round, right now,
570	suddenly, there'd be huge changes in the environment,
575	in the concentration of people,
578	and it was just unbelievable, the amount of -- all the change in it.
590	I wanted to -- well, one of the biggest changes is, 200 years ago,
595	we began using coal from underground, which has a lot of pollution,
601	and 100 years ago, began getting gasoline from underground,
605	with a lot of pollution. And gasoline consumption, or production,
611	will reach its limit in about ten years, and then go down,
616	and we wonder what's going to happen with transportation.
622	I wanted to show the slide --
625	this slide, I think, is the most important one any of you will see, ever, because --
634	(Laughter)
636	(Applause) --
639	it shows nature versus humans, and goes from 1850 to 2050.
646	And so, the year 2000, you see there.
649	And this is the weight of all air and land vertebrates.
654	Humans and muskrats and giraffes and birds and so on, are --
659	the red line goes up. That's the humans and livestock and pets portion.
666	The green line goes down. That's the wild nature portion.
670	Humans, livestock and pets are, now, 98 percent of the total world's mass
676	of vertebrates on land and air.
679	And you don't know what the future will hold,
682	but it's not going to get a lower percentage.
686	Ten thousand years ago, the humans and livestock and pets
690	were not even one tenth of one percent
692	and wouldn't even have been visible on such a curve.
696	Now they are 98 percent, and it, I think, shows human domination of the Earth.
707	I give a talk to some remarkable high school students each summer,
714	and ask them, after they've asked me questions,
717	and I give them a talk and so on. Then I ask them questions.
721	What's the population of the Earth?
723	What's the population of the Earth going to be
725	when you're the age of your parents?
727	Which I'd never, really -- they had never, really, thought about
729	but, now, they think about it.
731	And then, what population of the Earth would be an equilibrium
738	that could continue on, and be for 2050, 2100, 2150?
744	And they form little groups, all fighting with each other,
747	and when I leave, two hours later,
749	most of them are saying about 2 billion people,
753	and they don't have any clue about how to get down to 2 billion,
758	nor do I, but I think they're right and this is a serious problem.
766	"Rachel Carson was thinking of these, and came out with ""Silent Spring,"" way back."
773	"""Solar Manifesto"" by Hermann Scheer, in Germany,"
777	claims all energy on Earth can be derived, for every country,
782	from solar energy and water, and so on.
790	You don't need to dig down for these chemicals,
793	and we can do things much more efficiently.
797	Let's have the next slide.
799	"So this just summarizes it. ""Over billions of years,"
802	on a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life --
805	complex and probable, wonderful and fragile.
808	Suddenly, we humans, a recently arrived species,
811	no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature,
815	have grown in population, technology and intelligence
818	"to a position of terrible power. We, now, wield the paintbrush."""
822	We're in charge. It's frightening.
826	And I do a painting every 20 or 25 years. This is the last one.
831	(Laughter)
833	And [it] shows the Earth in a time flag: on the right,
837	in trilobites and dinosaurs and so on;
840	and over the triangle, we now get to civilization and TV
845	and traffic jams and so on.
847	I have no idea of what comes next,
850	so I just used robotic and natural cockroaches as the future,
855	as a little warning.
857	And two weeks after this drawing was done,
860	we actually had our first project contract, at AeroVironment,
864	on robotic cockroaches, which was very frightening to me.
869	(Laughter)
871	(Paper rustling)
874	Well, that'll be all the slides.
881	As time went on, we stopped our environmental programs.
884	We focused more on the really serious energy problems
889	of the future, and we produced products for the company.
896	And we developed the impact car that General Motors made,
901	the EV1, out of --
904	and got the Air Resources Board to have the regulations
911	that stimulated the electric cars, but they've since come apart.
915	And we've done a lot of things, small drone airplanes and so on.
922	I have a Helios. We have the first video.
929	(Video) Narrator: With a wingspan of 247 feet, this makes her larger than a Boeing 747.
934	(Music)
943	Her designers' attention to detail and her construction
946	gives Helios' structure the flexibility and strength
949	to deal with the turbulence encountered in the atmosphere.
952	This enables her to easily ride through the air currents
955	as if she's sliding along on the ocean waves.
958	Paul MacCready: The wings could touch together on top and not break. We think.
963	(Laughter)
966	Narrator: And Helios now begins the process of turning her back to the sun,
969	to maximize the power from her solar array.
972	(Music)
980	As the sky gets darker, and the outside air temperatures drop
984	below minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit,
987	the most environmentally hostile segment of Helios's journey
990	has gone by without notice,
992	except for being recorded by specially designed data acquisition systems
996	and their associated sensors.
999	Approaching a peak radar altitude of 96,863 feet,
1004	at 4:12 p.m., Helios is standing on top of 98 percent of the Earth's atmosphere.
1009	This is more than 10,000 feet higher
1012	than the previous world's altitude record held by the SR-71 Blackbird.
1017	(Applause)
1026	PM: That plane has many purposes, but it's aimed for communications,
1031	and it can fly so slowly that it'll just stay up at 65,000 feet.
1038	Eventually, it will be able to have to stay up day, night, day, night,
1041	for six months at a time, acting like the synchronous satellite,
1045	but only ten miles above the Earth.
1047	Let's have the next video. This shows the other end of the spectrum.
1050	(Video) Narrator: A tiny airplane, the AV Pointer serves for surveillance.
1053	In effect a pair of roving eyeglasses,
1055	a cutting-edge example of where miniaturization can lead
1058	if the operator is remote from the vehicle.
1061	It is convenient to carry, assemble, and launch by hand.
1064	Battery-powered, it is silent and rarely noticed.
1068	It sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator.
1071	With on-board GPS, it can navigate autonomously,
1075	and it is rugged enough to self-land without damage.
1079	PM: Okay, and let's have the next.
1081	(Applause)
1085	That plane is widely used by the military, now, in all their operations.
1090	Let's have the next video.
1094	(Video) (Music)
1108	Alan Alda: He's got it, he's got it, he's got it on his head.
1110	(Music)
1112	We're going to end our visit with Paul MacCready's flying circus
1115	by meeting his son, Tyler, who, with his two brothers,
1118	helped build the Gossamer Condor, 25 years ago.
1122	Tyler MacCready: You can chase it, like this, for hours.
1124	AA: When they got bored with their father's project,
1127	they invented an extraordinary little plane of their own.
1129	TM: And I can control it by putting the lift on one side of the wing, or on the other.
1134	AA: They called it their Walkalong Glider.
1136	(Music)
1138	I've never seen anything like that.
1139	How old were you when you invented that?
1141	TM: Oh, 10, 11. (AA: Oh my God.)
1144	TM: 12, something like that. (AA: That's amazing.)
1146	PM: And Tyler's here to show you the Walkalong.
1149	(Applause)
1154	TM: All right. You all got a couple of these in your gift bags,
1158	and one of the first things,
1161	the production version seemed to dive a little bit,
1163	and so I would just suggest you bend the wing tips up a little bit
1166	before you try flying it.
1168	I'll give you a demonstration of how it works.
1170	The idea is that it soars on the lift over your body, like a seagull soaring on a cliff.
1176	As the wind comes up, it has to go over the cliff, so
1179	as you walk through the air, it goes around your body, some has to go over you.
1184	And so you just keep the glider positioned in that up current.
1187	The launch is the difficult part: you've got to hold it high up, over your head,
1190	and you start walking forward, and just let go of it, and you can control it like that.
1196	(Laughter)
1198	And then also, like it said in the video,
1201	you can turn it left or right
1203	just by putting the lift under one wing or another.
1205	So I can do it -- oops, that was going to be a right turn.
1210	(Laughter)
1211	Okay, this one will be a left turn.
1215	Here, but --
1217	(Applause) --
1218	anyway.
1220	(Applause)
1223	And that's it, so you can just control it, wherever you want,
1226	and it's just hours of fun. And these are no longer in production,
1230	so you have real collector's items.
1232	(Laughter)
1234	And this, we just wanted to show you --
1239	if we can get the video running on this, yeah --
1241	just an example of a little video surveillance.
1247	(Laughter)
1249	This was flying around in the party last night, and --
1253	(Laughter) --
1255	you can see how it just can fly around,
1258	and you can spy on anybody you want.
1260	(Laughter)
1266	And that's it. I was going to bring an airplane,
1268	but I was worried about hitting people in here,
1270	so I thought this would be a little bit more gentle.
1274	And that's it, yeah, just a few inventions.
1277	(Applause)
1285	All right.
