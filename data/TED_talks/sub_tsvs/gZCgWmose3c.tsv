12.401	One of the things I want to establish right from the start
14.717	is that not all neurosurgeons wear cowboy boots.
17.747	I just wanted you to know that.
19.926	So I am indeed a neurosurgeon,
22.335	and I follow a long tradition of neurosurgery,
26.262	and what I'm going to tell you about today
27.855	is adjusting the dials in the circuits in the brain,
30.173	being able to go anywhere in the brain
32.128	and turning areas of the brain up or down
34.547	to help our patients.
36.759	So as I said, neurosurgery comes from a long tradition.
39.709	It's been around for about 7,000 years.
43.261	In Mesoamerica, there used to be neurosurgery,
46.986	and there were these neurosurgeons that used to treat patients.
50.754	And they were trying to -- they knew that the brain was involved
54.68	in neurological and psychiatric disease.
57.032	They didn't know exactly what they were doing.
59.193	Not much has changed, by the way. (Laughter)
62.007	But they thought that,
63.88	if you had a neurologic or psychiatric disease,
65.883	it must be because you are possessed
68.474	by an evil spirit.
70.826	So if you are possessed by an evil spirit
72.795	causing neurologic or psychiatric problems,
75.615	then the way to treat this is, of course,
77.636	to make a hole in your skull and let the evil spirit escape.
83.319	So this was the thinking back then,
84.697	and these individuals made these holes.
88.841	Sometimes the patients were a little bit reluctant
91.824	to go through this because, you can tell that
94.239	the holes are made partially and then, I think,
96.69	there was some trepanation, and then they left very quickly
98.705	and it was only a partial hole,
100.606	and we know they survived these procedures.
102.922	But this was common.
104.13	There were some sites where one percent
105.396	of all the skulls have these holes, and so you can see
108.121	that neurologic and psychiatric disease is quite common,
111.315	and it was also quite common about 7,000 years ago.
115.748	Now, in the course of time,
117.901	we've come to realize that
120.121	different parts of the brain do different things.
122.379	So there are areas of the brain that are dedicated
123.566	to controlling your movement or your vision
126.259	or your memory or your appetite, and so on.
129.208	And when things work well, then the nervous system
131.942	works well, and everything functions.
133.611	But once in a while, things don't go so well,
135.858	and there's trouble in these circuits,
138.4	and there are some rogue neurons that are misfiring
141.104	and causing trouble, or sometimes they're underactive
144.283	and they're not quite working as they should.
146.827	Now, the manifestation of this
148.964	depends on where in the brain these neurons are.
151.448	So when these neurons are in the motor circuit,
153.87	you get dysfunction in the movement system,
156.282	and you get things like Parkinson's disease.
158.448	When the malfunction is in a circuit that regulates your mood,
161.744	you get things like depression,
164.028	and when it is in a circuit that controls your memory and cognitive function,
167.852	then you get things like Alzheimer's disease.
170.373	So what we've been able to do is to pinpoint
173.096	where these disturbances are in the brain,
175.403	and we've been able to intervene within these circuits
178.44	in the brain to either turn them up or turn them down.
182.096	So this is very much like choosing the correct station
184.38	on the radio dial.
186.355	Once you choose the right station, whether it be jazz or opera,
189.004	in our case whether it be movement or mood,
191.337	we can put the dial there,
193.303	and then we can use a second button to adjust the volume,
196.074	to turn it up or turn it down.
198.083	So what I'm going to tell you about
199.311	is using the circuitry of the brain to implant electrodes
203.369	and turning areas of the brain up and down
205.837	to see if we can help our patients.
207.541	And this is accomplished using this kind of device,
209.874	and this is called deep brain stimulation.
212.335	So what we're doing is placing these electrodes throughout the brain.
215.406	Again, we are making holes in the skull about the size of a dime,
219.355	putting an electrode in, and then this electrode
221.506	is completely underneath the skin
223.734	down to a pacemaker in the chest,
225.824	and with a remote control very much like a television remote control,
230.352	we can adjust how much electricity we deliver
233.331	to these areas of the brain.
235.399	We can turn it up or down, on or off.
238.29	Now, about a hundred thousand patients in the world
240.945	have received deep brain stimulation,
242.821	and I'm going to show you some examples
243.975	of using deep brain stimulation to treat disorders of movement,
246.686	disorders of mood and disorders of cognition.
251.2	So this looks something like this when it's in the brain.
253.939	You see the electrode going through the skull into the brain
256.174	and resting there, and we can place this really anywhere in the brain.
259.357	I tell my friends that no neuron is safe
261.817	from a neurosurgeon, because we can really reach
263.999	just about anywhere in the brain quite safely now.
266.565	Now the first example I'm going to show you is a patient
269.085	with Parkinson's disease,
270.795	and this lady has Parkinson's disease,
272.782	and she has these electrodes in her brain,
275.092	and I'm going to show you what she's like
276.374	when the electrodes are turned off and she has her Parkinson's symptoms,
279.881	and then we're going to turn it on.
282.214	So this looks something like this.
284.909	The electrodes are turned off now, and you can see that she has tremor.
289.42	(Video) Man: Okay. Woman: I can't. Man: Can you try to touch my finger?
293.139	(Video) Man: That's a little better. Woman: That side is better.
296.764	We're now going to turn it on.
300.556	It's on. Just turned it on.
306.561	And this works like that, instantly.
309.824	And the difference between shaking in this way and not --
312.806	(Applause)
317.407	The difference between shaking in this way and not is related to the misbehavior
321.512	of 25,000 neurons in her subthalamic nucleus.
325.485	So we now know how to find these troublemakers
328.061	"and tell them, ""Gentlemen, that's enough."
329.452	"We want you to stop doing that."""
330.786	And we do that with electricity.
332.008	So we use electricity to dictate how they fire,
335.422	and we try to block their misbehavior using electricity.
338.884	So in this case, we are suppressing the activity of abnormal neurons.
342.328	We started using this technique in other problems,
344.89	and I'm going to tell you about a fascinating problem
346.292	that we encountered, a case of dystonia.
349.46	So dystonia is a disorder affecting children.
351.965	It's a genetic disorder, and it involves a twisting motion,
355.027	and these children get progressively more and more twisting
357.851	until they can't breathe, until they get sores,
359.842	urinary infections, and then they die.
361.873	So back in 1997, I was asked to see this young boy,
365.246	perfectly normal. He has this genetic form of dystonia.
368.202	There are eight children in the family.
370.421	Five of them have dystonia.
373.78	So here he is.
375.965	This boy is nine years old, perfectly normal until the age six,
380.151	and then he started twisting his body, first the right foot,
384.546	then the left foot, then the right arm, then the left arm,
387.966	then the trunk, and then by the time he arrived,
391.213	within the course of one or two years of the disease onset,
394.153	he could no longer walk, he could no longer stand.
396.473	He was crippled, and indeed the natural progression
399.171	as this gets worse is for them to become progressively twisted,
402.726	progressively disabled, and many of these children do not survive.
408.416	So he is one of five kids.
410.444	The only way he could get around was crawling on his belly like this.
414.538	He did not respond to any drugs.
416.494	We did not know what to do with this boy.
418.434	We did not know what operation to do,
420.55	where to go in the brain,
422.744	but on the basis of our results in Parkinson's disease,
425.517	we reasoned, why don't we try to suppress
427.522	the same area in the brain that we suppressed
430.619	in Parkinson's disease, and let's see what happens?
434.274	So here he was. We operated on him
436.061	hoping that he would get better. We did not know.
439.935	So here he is now, back in Israel where he lives,
444.062	three months after the procedure, and here he is.
448.115	(Applause)
456.669	On the basis of this result, this is now a procedure
459.29	that's done throughout the world,
460.538	and there have been hundreds of children
461.833	that have been helped with this kind of surgery.
466.04	This boy is now in university
468.157	and leads quite a normal life.
470.193	This has been one of the most satisfying cases
472.561	that I have ever done in my entire career,
474.54	to restore movement and walking to this kind of child.
477.917	(Applause)
484.172	We realized that perhaps we could use this technology
487.041	not only in circuits that control your movement
489.213	but also circuits that control other things,
491.165	and the next thing that we took on
492.312	was circuits that control your mood.
495.305	And we decided to take on depression,
497.381	and the reason we took on depression is because it's so prevalent,
499.64	and as you know, there are many treatments for depression,
502.184	with medication and psychotherapy,
504.221	even electroconvulsive therapy,
506.283	but there are millions of people,
507.617	and there are still 10 or 20 percent of patients with depression
510.409	that do not respond, and it is these patients that we want to help.
513.661	And let's see if we can use this technique
515.764	to help these patients with depression.
518.003	So the first thing we did was, we compared,
519.853	what's different in the brain of someone with depression
521.677	and someone who is normal,
523.345	and what we did was PET scans to look at the blood flow of the brain,
526.805	and what we noticed is that in patients with depression
529.174	compared to normals,
531.219	areas of the brain are shut down,
532.717	and those are the areas in blue.
533.982	So here you really have the blues,
535.602	and the areas in blue are areas that are involved
539.175	in motivation, in drive and decision-making,
541.831	and indeed, if you're severely depressed as these patients were,
544.326	those are impaired. You lack motivation and drive.
547.018	The other thing we discovered
548.897	was an area that was overactive, area 25,
551.386	seen there in red,
552.974	and area 25 is the sadness center of the brain.
555.631	If I make any of you sad, for example, I make you remember
558.504	the last time you saw your parent before they died
560.791	or a friend before they died,
562.424	this area of the brain lights up.
563.63	It is the sadness center of the brain.
565.353	And so patients with depression have hyperactivity.
568.565	The area of the brain for sadness is on red hot.
570.743	The thermostat is set at 100 degrees,
573.4	and the other areas of the brain, involved in drive and motivation, are shut down.
576.528	So we wondered, can we place electrodes in this area of sadness
579.525	and see if we can turn down the thermostat,
581.954	can we turn down the activity,
583.667	and what will be the consequence of that?
585.789	So we went ahead and implanted electrodes in patients with depression.
588.916	This is work done with my colleague Helen Mayberg from Emory.
591.403	And we placed electrodes in area 25,
593.337	and in the top scan you see before the operation,
595.622	area 25, the sadness area is red hot,
597.908	and the frontal lobes are shut down in blue,
600.302	and then, after three months of continuous stimulation,
605.725	we have a complete reversal of this.
607.499	We're able to drive down area 25,
610.338	down to a more normal level,
612.29	and we're able to turn back online
614.326	the frontal lobes of the brain,
615.634	and indeed we're seeing very striking results
617.503	in these patients with severe depression.
620.25	So now we are in clinical trials, and are in Phase III clinical trials,
623.152	and this may become a new procedure,
625.695	if it's safe and we find that it's effective,
627.878	to treat patients with severe depression.
631.567	I've shown you that we can use deep brain stimulation
634.527	to treat the motor system
636.614	in cases of Parkinson's disease and dystonia.
639.06	I've shown you that we can use it to treat a mood circuit
641.445	in cases of depression.
643.095	Can we use deep brain stimulation to make you smarter?
647.64	(Laughter)
649.736	Anybody interested in that?
652.302	(Applause)
654.602	Of course we can, right?
657.59	So what we've decided to do is
659.804	we're going to try to turbocharge
662.225	the memory circuits in the brain.
664.43	We're going to place electrodes within the circuits
667.166	that regulate your memory and cognitive function
669.842	to see if we can turn up their activity.
673.112	Now we're not going to do this in normal people.
675.05	We're going to do this in people that have cognitive deficits,
678.702	and we've chosen to treat patients with Alzheimer's disease
682.161	who have cognitive and memory deficits.
684.268	As you know, this is the main symptom
686.207	of early onset Alzheimer's disease.
688.63	So we've placed electrodes within this circuit
690.824	in an area of the brain called the fornix,
692.819	which is the highway in and out of this memory circuit,
695.597	with the idea to see if we can turn on this memory circuit,
699.025	and whether that can, in turn, help these patients
702.274	with Alzheimer's disease.
704.583	Now it turns out that in Alzheimer's disease,
706.901	there's a huge deficit in glucose utilization in the brain.
710.973	The brain is a bit of a hog when it comes to using glucose.
714.391	It uses 20 percent of all your --
716.151	even though it only weighs two percent --
717.666	it uses 10 times more glucose than it should based on its weight.
720.811	Twenty percent of all the glucose in your body is used by the brain,
723.394	and as you go from being normal
725.824	to having mild cognitive impairment,
728.017	which is a precursor for Alzheimer's, all the way to Alzheimer's disease,
730.472	then there are areas of the brain that stop using glucose.
733.161	They shut down. They turn off.
735.456	And indeed, what we see is that these areas in red
737.738	around the outside ribbon of the brain
739.505	are progressively getting more and more blue
741.781	until they shut down completely.
744.953	This is analogous to having a power failure
747.312	in an area of the brain, a regional power failure.
749.855	So the lights are out in parts of the brain
752.252	in patients with Alzheimer's disease,
754.85	and the question is, are the lights out forever,
757.259	or can we turn the lights back on?
760.12	Can we get those areas of the brain to use glucose once again?
763.356	So this is what we did. We implanted electrodes in the fornix
765.906	of patients with Alzheimer's disease, we turned it on,
768.519	and we looked at what happens to glucose use in the brain.
772.03	And indeed, at the top, you'll see before the surgery,
775.292	the areas in blue are the areas that use less glucose than normal,
778.656	predominantly the parietal and temporal lobes.
780.864	These areas of the brain are shut down.
782.574	The lights are out in these areas of the brain.
785.249	We then put in the DBS electrodes and we wait for a month
788.203	or a year, and the areas in red
789.594	represent the areas where we increase glucose utilization.
792.901	And indeed, we are able to get these areas of the brain
795.021	that were not using glucose to use glucose once again.
798.535	So the message here is that, in Alzheimer's disease,
800.887	the lights are out, but there is someone home,
803.216	and we're able to turn the power back on
805.365	to these areas of the brain, and as we do so,
807.671	we expect that their functions will return.
810.607	So this is now in clinical trials.
812.734	We are going to operate on 50 patients
814.635	with early Alzheimer's disease
816.613	to see whether this is safe and effective,
818.67	whether we can improve their neurologic function.
821.649	(Applause)
829.129	So the message I want to leave you with today is that,
832.077	indeed, there are several circuits in the brain
834.681	that are malfunctioning across various disease states,
838.607	whether we're talking about Parkinson's disease,
840.815	depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's.
843.897	We are now learning to understand what are the circuits,
846.927	what are the areas of the brain that are responsible for
849.129	the clinical signs and the symptoms of those diseases.
851.649	We can now reach those circuits.
853.955	We can introduce electrodes within those circuits.
856.587	We can graduate the activity of those circuits.
859.569	We can turn them down if they are overactive,
862.821	if they're causing trouble, trouble that is felt throughout the brain,
865.778	or we can turn them up if they are underperforming,
868.359	and in so doing, we think that we may be able to help
870.752	the overall function of the brain.
873.092	The implications of this, of course, is that we may be able
875.646	to modify the symptoms of the disease,
877.956	but I haven't told you but there's also some evidence
879.865	that we might be able to help the repair of damaged areas of the brain using electricity,
884.028	and this is something for the future, to see if, indeed,
886.48	we not only change the activity but also
888.719	some of the reparative functions of the brain
890.733	can be harvested.
892.288	So I envision that we're going to see a great expansion
895.335	of indications of this technique.
897.787	We're going to see electrodes being placed for many disorders of the brain.
900.566	One of the most exciting things about this is that, indeed,
903.525	it involves multidisciplinary work.
905.372	It involves the work of engineers, of imaging scientists,
908.174	of basic scientists, of neurologists,
910.376	psychiatrists, neurosurgeons, and certainly at the interface
913.128	of these multiple disciplines that there's the excitement.
916.069	And I think that we will see that
918.826	we will be able to chase more of these evil spirits
922.262	out from the brain as time goes on,
924.158	and the consequence of that, of course, will be
926.06	that we will be able to help many more patients.
928.332	Thank you very much.
