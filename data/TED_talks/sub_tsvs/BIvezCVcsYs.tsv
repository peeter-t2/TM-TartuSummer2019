13.256	"In the movie ""Interstellar,"""
15.14	we get an up-close look
15.14	at a supermassive black hole.
18.491	Set against a backdrop of bright gas,
20.658	the black hole's massive
20.658	gravitational pull
22.8	bends light into a ring.
24.259	However, this isn't a real photograph,
26.392	but a computer graphic rendering --
28.202	an artistic interpretation
28.202	of what a black hole might look like.
32.221	A hundred years ago,
33.411	Albert Einstein first published
33.411	his theory of general relativity.
37.036	In the years since then,
38.499	scientists have provided
38.499	a lot of evidence in support of it.
41.496	But one thing predicted
41.496	from this theory, black holes,
44.604	still have not been directly observed.
46.978	Although we have some idea
46.978	as to what a black hole might look like,
50.208	we've never actually taken
50.208	a picture of one before.
53.011	However, you might be surprised to know
53.011	that that may soon change.
57.314	We may be seeing our first picture
57.314	of a black hole in the next couple years.
61.502	Getting this first picture will come down
61.502	to an international team of scientists,
65.484	an Earth-sized telescope
67.075	and an algorithm that puts together
67.075	the final picture.
69.931	Although I won't be able to show you
69.931	a real picture of a black hole today,
73.483	I'd like to give you a brief glimpse
73.483	into the effort involved
76.418	in getting that first picture.
79.297	My name is Katie Bouman,
80.758	and I'm a PhD student at MIT.
83.348	I do research in a computer science lab
85.399	that works on making computers
85.399	see through images and video.
88.721	But although I'm not an astronomer,
90.907	today I'd like to show you
92.216	how I've been able to contribute
92.216	to this exciting project.
95.143	If you go out past
95.143	the bright city lights tonight,
97.998	you may just be lucky enough
97.998	to see a stunning view
100.458	of the Milky Way Galaxy.
101.975	And if you could zoom past
101.975	millions of stars,
	of the spiraling Milky Way,
108.24	we'd eventually reach
108.24	a cluster of stars right at the center.
111.785	Peering past all the galactic dust
111.785	with infrared telescopes,
115.015	astronomers have watched these stars
115.015	for over 16 years.
118.906	But it's what they don't see
118.906	that is the most spectacular.
122.519	These stars seem to orbit
122.519	an invisible object.
125.609	By tracking the paths of these stars,
127.956	astronomers have concluded
129.274	that the only thing small and heavy
129.274	enough to cause this motion
132.427	is a supermassive black hole --
134.419	an object so dense that it sucks up
134.419	anything that ventures too close --
138.621	even light.
140.139	But what happens if we were
140.139	to zoom in even further?
143.224	Is it possible to see something
143.224	that, by definition, is impossible to see?
148.539	Well, it turns out that if we were
148.539	to zoom in at radio wavelengths,
151.807	we'd expect to see a ring of light
153.513	caused by the gravitational
153.513	lensing of hot plasma
155.948	zipping around the black hole.
157.801	In other words,
158.985	the black hole casts a shadow
158.985	on this backdrop of bright material,
162.18	carving out a sphere of darkness.
164.046	This bright ring reveals
164.046	the black hole's event horizon,
167.409	where the gravitational pull
167.409	becomes so great
169.833	that not even light can escape.
171.483	Einstein's equations predict
171.483	the size and shape of this ring,
174.366	so taking a picture of it
174.366	wouldn't only be really cool,
177.598	it would also help to verify
177.598	that these equations hold
180.24	in the extreme conditions
180.24	around the black hole.
182.73	However, this black hole
182.73	is so far away from us,
185.312	that from Earth, this ring appears
185.312	incredibly small --
188.434	the same size to us as an orange
188.434	on the surface of the moon.
192.578	That makes taking a picture of it
192.578	extremely difficult.
196.465	Why is that?
198.332	Well, it all comes down
198.332	to a simple equation.
201.544	Due to a phenomenon called diffraction,
203.984	there are fundamental limits
205.363	to the smallest objects
205.363	that we can possibly see.
208.609	This governing equation says
208.609	that in order to see smaller and smaller,
212.305	we need to make our telescope
212.305	bigger and bigger.
214.916	But even with the most powerful
214.916	optical telescopes here on Earth,
218.009	we can't even get close
218.009	to the resolution necessary
220.452	to image on the surface of the moon.
222.674	In fact, here I show one of the highest
222.674	resolution images ever taken
226.315	of the moon from Earth.
227.736	It contains roughly 13,000 pixels,
230.317	and yet each pixel would contain
230.317	over 1.5 million oranges.
235.216	So how big of a telescope do we need
237.212	in order to see an orange
237.212	on the surface of the moon
240.001	and, by extension, our black hole?
242.239	Well, it turns out
242.239	that by crunching the numbers,
244.603	you can easily calculate
244.603	that we would need a telescope
247.237	the size of the entire Earth.
248.654	(Laughter)
249.702	If we could build
249.702	this Earth-sized telescope,
251.845	we could just start to make out
251.845	that distinctive ring of light
254.794	indicative of the black
254.794	hole's event horizon.
257.001	Although this picture wouldn't contain
257.001	all the detail we see
259.943	in computer graphic renderings,
261.473	it would allow us to safely get
261.473	our first glimpse
263.796	of the immediate environment
263.796	around a black hole.
266.307	However, as you can imagine,
267.944	building a single-dish telescope
267.944	the size of the Earth is impossible.
271.592	But in the famous words of Mick Jagger,
273.503	"""You can't always get what you want,"
275.318	but if you try sometimes,
275.318	you just might find
277.529	"you get what you need."""
278.768	And by connecting telescopes
278.768	from around the world,
281.256	an international collaboration
281.256	called the Event Horizon Telescope
284.818	is creating a computational telescope
284.818	the size of the Earth,
287.951	capable of resolving structure
289.512	on the scale of a black
289.512	hole's event horizon.
291.735	This network of telescopes is scheduled
291.735	to take its very first picture
295.146	of a black hole next year.
296.985	Each telescope in the worldwide
296.985	network works together.
300.347	Linked through the precise timing
300.347	of atomic clocks,
303.083	teams of researchers at each
303.083	of the sights freeze light
305.764	by collecting thousands
305.764	of terabytes of data.
308.75	This data is then processed in a lab
308.75	right here in Massachusetts.
313.791	So how does this even work?
315.609	Remember if we want to see the black hole
315.609	in the center of our galaxy,
319.036	we need to build this impossibly large
319.036	Earth-sized telescope?
322.042	For just a second,
322.042	let's pretend we could build
324.298	a telescope the size of the Earth.
326.164	This would be a little bit
326.164	like turning the Earth
328.643	into a giant spinning disco ball.
330.414	Each individual mirror would collect light
332.638	that we could then combine
332.638	together to make a picture.
335.259	However, now let's say
335.259	we remove most of those mirrors
337.944	so only a few remained.
339.94	We could still try to combine
339.94	this information together,
342.841	but now there are a lot of holes.
344.858	These remaining mirrors represent
344.858	the locations where we have telescopes.
349.255	This is an incredibly small number
349.255	of measurements to make a picture from.
353.358	But although we only collect light
353.358	at a few telescope locations,
357.22	as the Earth rotates, we get to see
357.22	other new measurements.
360.667	In other words, as the disco ball spins,
360.667	those mirrors change locations
364.51	and we get to observe
364.51	different parts of the image.
367.433	The imaging algorithms we develop
367.433	fill in the missing gaps of the disco ball
371.475	in order to reconstruct
371.475	the underlying black hole image.
374.532	If we had telescopes located
374.532	everywhere on the globe --
377.192	in other words, the entire disco ball --
379.157	this would be trivial.
380.465	However, we only see a few samples,
380.465	and for that reason,
383.811	there are an infinite number
383.811	of possible images
386.223	that are perfectly consistent
386.223	with our telescope measurements.
389.211	However, not all images are created equal.
392.669	Some of those images look more like
392.669	what we think of as images than others.
397.151	And so, my role in helping to take
397.151	the first image of a black hole
400.397	is to design algorithms that find
400.397	the most reasonable image
403.353	that also fits the telescope measurements.
406.547	Just as a forensic sketch artist
406.547	uses limited descriptions
410.513	to piece together a picture using
410.513	their knowledge of face structure,
414.051	the imaging algorithms I develop
414.051	use our limited telescope data
417.39	to guide us to a picture that also
417.39	looks like stuff in our universe.
421.736	Using these algorithms,
421.736	we're able to piece together pictures
425.411	from this sparse, noisy data.
427.615	So here I show a sample reconstruction
427.615	done using simulated data,
432.168	when we pretend to point our telescopes
434.125	to the black hole
434.125	in the center of our galaxy.
436.734	Although this is just a simulation,
436.734	reconstruction such as this give us hope
441.213	that we'll soon be able to reliably take
441.213	the first image of a black hole
444.69	and from it, determine
444.69	the size of its ring.
447.938	Although I'd love to go on
447.938	about all the details of this algorithm,
451.161	luckily for you, I don't have the time.
453.359	But I'd still like
453.359	to give you a brief idea
455.384	of how we define
455.384	what our universe looks like,
457.71	and how we use this to reconstruct
457.71	and verify our results.
462.2	Since there are an infinite number
462.2	of possible images
464.72	that perfectly explain
464.72	our telescope measurements,
467.109	we have to choose
467.109	between them in some way.
469.738	We do this by ranking the images
471.6	based upon how likely they are
471.6	to be the black hole image,
474.458	and then choosing the one
474.458	that's most likely.
476.964	So what do I mean by this exactly?
479.682	Let's say we were trying to make a model
481.684	that told us how likely an image
481.684	were to appear on Facebook.
484.891	We'd probably want the model to say
486.616	it's pretty unlikely that someone
486.616	would post this noise image on the left,
490.197	and pretty likely that someone
490.197	would post a selfie
492.64	like this one on the right.
493.998	The image in the middle is blurry,
495.661	so even though it's more likely
495.661	we'd see it on Facebook
498.324	compared to the noise image,
499.708	it's probably less likely we'd see it
499.708	compared to the selfie.
502.692	But when it comes to images
502.692	from the black hole,
505.006	we're posed with a real conundrum:
505.006	we've never seen a black hole before.
508.532	In that case, what is a likely
508.532	black hole image,
510.847	and what should we assume
510.847	about the structure of black holes?
513.809	We could try to use images
513.809	from simulations we've done,
516.465	like the image of the black hole
516.465	"from ""Interstellar,"""
519.019	but if we did this,
519.019	it could cause some serious problems.
521.981	What would happen
521.981	if Einstein's theories didn't hold?
525.385	We'd still want to reconstruct
525.385	an accurate picture of what was going on.
529.37	If we bake Einstein's equations
529.37	too much into our algorithms,
532.765	we'll just end up seeing
532.765	what we expect to see.
535.544	In other words,
535.544	we want to leave the option open
537.844	for there being a giant elephant
537.844	at the center of our galaxy.
540.791	(Laughter)
541.872	Different types of images have
541.872	very distinct features.
544.885	We can easily tell the difference
544.885	between black hole simulation images
548.457	and images we take
548.457	every day here on Earth.
550.757	We need a way to tell our algorithms
550.757	what images look like
553.885	without imposing one type
553.885	of image's features too much.
557.685	One way we can try to get around this
559.602	is by imposing the features
559.602	of different kinds of images
562.688	and seeing how the type of image we assume
562.688	affects our reconstructions.
567.532	If all images' types produce
567.532	a very similar-looking image,
571.047	then we can start to become more confident
573.128	that the image assumptions we're making
573.128	are not biasing this picture that much.
577.325	This is a little bit like
577.325	giving the same description
580.339	to three different sketch artists
580.339	from all around the world.
583.359	If they all produce
583.359	a very similar-looking face,
586.243	then we can start to become confident
588.06	that they're not imposing their own
588.06	cultural biases on the drawings.
591.7	One way we can try to impose
591.7	different image features
595.039	is by using pieces of existing images.
598.034	So we take a large collection of images,
600.218	and we break them down
600.218	into their little image patches.
602.96	We then can treat each image patch
602.96	a little bit like pieces of a puzzle.
607.269	And we use commonly seen puzzle pieces
607.269	to piece together an image
611.571	that also fits our telescope measurements.
614.86	Different types of images have
614.86	very distinctive sets of puzzle pieces.
618.627	So what happens when we take the same data
621.457	but we use different sets of puzzle pieces
621.457	to reconstruct the image?
625.611	Let's first start with black hole
625.611	image simulation puzzle pieces.
630.401	OK, this looks reasonable.
632.016	This looks like what we expect
632.016	a black hole to look like.
634.734	But did we just get it
635.951	because we just fed it little pieces
635.951	of black hole simulation images?
639.289	Let's try another set of puzzle pieces
641.193	from astronomical, non-black hole objects.
644.734	OK, we get a similar-looking image.
646.884	And then how about pieces
646.884	from everyday images,
649.144	like the images you take
649.144	with your own personal camera?
653.132	Great, we see the same image.
655.271	When we get the same image
655.271	from all different sets of puzzle pieces,
658.661	then we can start to become more confident
660.731	that the image assumptions we're making
662.721	aren't biasing the final
662.721	image we get too much.
665.666	Another thing we can do is take
665.666	the same set of puzzle pieces,
668.943	such as the ones derived
668.943	from everyday images,
671.456	and use them to reconstruct
671.456	many different kinds of source images.
675.08	So in our simulations,
676.375	we pretend a black hole looks like
676.375	astronomical non-black hole objects,
680.174	as well as everyday images like
680.174	the elephant in the center of our galaxy.
684.047	When the results of our algorithms
684.047	on the bottom look very similar
687.239	to the simulation's truth image on top,
689.359	then we can start to become
689.359	more confident in our algorithms.
692.729	And I really want to emphasize here
694.62	that all of these pictures were created
696.578	by piecing together little pieces
696.578	of everyday photographs,
699.538	like you'd take with your own
699.538	personal camera.
701.777	So an image of a black hole
701.777	we've never seen before
705.077	may eventually be created by piecing
705.077	together pictures we see all the time
709.044	of people, buildings,
709.044	trees, cats and dogs.
711.813	Imaging ideas like this
711.813	will make it possible for us
714.482	to take our very first pictures
714.482	of a black hole,
717.125	and hopefully, verify
717.125	those famous theories
719.596	on which scientists rely on a daily basis.
722.041	But of course, getting
722.041	imaging ideas like this working
724.673	would never have been possible
724.673	without the amazing team of researchers
728.019	that I have the privilege to work with.
729.93	It still amazes me
731.117	that although I began this project
731.117	with no background in astrophysics,
734.492	what we have achieved
734.492	through this unique collaboration
737.135	could result in the very first
737.135	images of a black hole.
739.918	But big projects like
739.918	the Event Horizon Telescope
742.64	are successful due to all
742.64	the interdisciplinary expertise
745.478	different people bring to the table.
747.292	We're a melting pot of astronomers,
749.022	physicists, mathematicians and engineers.
751.278	This is what will make it soon possible
753.856	to achieve something
753.856	once thought impossible.
756.733	I'd like to encourage all of you to go out
759.013	and help push the boundaries of science,
761.133	even if it may at first seem
761.133	as mysterious to you as a black hole.
765.058	Thank you.
766.256	(Applause)
