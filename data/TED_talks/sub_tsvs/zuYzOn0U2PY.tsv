15.974	When I was considering a career in the art world,
20.091	I took a course in London,
23.385	and one of my supervisors was this irascible Italian
27.838	called Pietro, who drank too much,
31.799	smoked too much and swore much too much.
37.288	But he was a passionate teacher,
40.464	and I remember one of our earlier classes with him,
43.506	he was projecting images on the wall,
45.854	asking us to think about them,
48.747	and he put up an image of a painting.
51.273	It was a landscape with figures, semi-dressed,
54.968	drinking wine. There was a nude woman
57.756	in the lower foreground, and on the hillside in the back,
61.132	there was a figure of the mythological god Bacchus,
65.146	"and he said, ""What is this?"""
67.495	And I -- no one else did, so I put up my hand, and I said,
70.772	"""It's a Bacchanal by Titian."""
74.133	"He said, ""It's a what?"""
76.786	I thought maybe I'd pronounced it wrong.
78.38	"""It's a Bacchanal by Titian."""
82.455	"He said, ""It's a what?"""
85.178	"I said, ""It's a Bacchanal by Titian."" (Laughter)"
88.262	"He said, ""You boneless bookworm!"
91.607	"It's a fucking orgy!"""
94.15	(Laughter)
97.221	As I said, he swore too much.
99.573	There was an important lesson for me in that.
103.105	Pietro was suspicious of formal art training,
106.933	art history training, because he feared
110.865	that it filled people up with jargon, and then they just
114.627	classified things rather than looking at them,
119.306	and he wanted to remind us that all art was once contemporary,
124.065	and he wanted us to use our eyes,
127.069	and he was especially evangelical about this message,
130.579	because he was losing his sight.
133.082	He wanted us to look and ask basic questions of objects.
137.441	What is it? How is it made? Why was it made?
140.987	How is it used?
143.754	And these were important lessons to me when
145.923	I subsequently became a professional art historian.
149.221	My kind of eureka moment came a few years later,
153.944	when I was studying the art of the courts of Northern Europe,
159.041	and of course it was very much discussed in terms of
162.689	the paintings and the sculptures
165.073	and the architecture of the day.
168.381	But as I began to read historical documents
172.218	and contemporary descriptions,
175.333	I found there was a kind of a missing component,
178.495	for everywhere I came across descriptions of tapestries.
183.581	Tapestries were ubiquitous between the Middle Ages
187.477	and, really, well into the 18th century,
190.409	and it was pretty apparent why.
192.903	Tapestries were portable. You could roll them up,
195.898	send them ahead of you, and in the time
198.543	it took to hang them up, you could transform a cold,
202.061	dank interior into a richly colored setting.
206.183	Tapestries effectively provided a vast canvas
211.11	on which the patrons of the day could depict the heroes
214.767	with whom they wanted to be associated,
217.469	or even themselves,
219.527	and in addition to that, tapestries were hugely expensive.
224.925	They required scores of highly skilled weavers
228.594	working over extended periods of time
231.43	with very expensive materials -- the wools, the silks,
235.231	even gold and silver thread.
238.068	So, all in all, in an age when the visual image
242.806	of any kind was rare, tapestries were an incredibly potent
248.158	form of propaganda.
251.803	Well, I became a tapestry historian.
255.831	In due course, I ended up as a curator
258.835	at the Metropolitan Museum, because I saw the Met
262.391	as one of the few places where I could organize
266.103	really big exhibitions about the subject
269.658	I cared so passionately about.
272.999	And in about 1997, the then-director Philippe de Montebello
277.385	gave me the go-ahead to organize an exhibition
280.728	for 2002. We normally have these very long lead-in times.
286.308	It wasn't straightforward. It's no longer a question
289.799	of chucking a tapestry in the back of a car.
293.204	They have to be wound on huge rollers,
296.668	shipped in oversized freighters.
300.63	Some of them are so big we had, to get them into the museum,
303.257	we had to take them up the great steps at the front.
307.953	We thought very hard about how to present this
312.638	unknown subject to a modern audience:
316.246	the dark colors to set off the colors that remained
319.216	in objects that were often faded;
322.017	the placing of lights to bring out the silk and the gold thread;
326.236	the labeling.
327.7	You know, we live in an age where we are so used
330.504	to television images and photographs,
333.516	a one-hit image. These were big, complex things,
338.563	almost like cartoons with multiple narratives.
343.028	We had to draw our audience in, get them to slow down,
346.258	to explore the objects.
349.183	There was a lot of skepticism. On the opening night,
353.333	I overheard one of the senior members of staff saying,
356.721	"""This is going to be a bomb."""
359.836	But in reality, in the course of the coming weeks and months,
364.106	hundreds of thousands of people came to see the show.
369.693	The exhibition was designed to be an experience,
374.338	and tapestries are hard to reproduce in photographs.
377.496	So I want you to use your imaginations,
380.495	thinking of these wall-high objects,
384.041	some of them 10 meters wide,
386.156	depicting lavish court scenes with courtiers and dandies
391.175	who would look quite at home in the pages of the fashion press today,
395.744	thick woods with hunters crashing through the undergrowth
399.95	in pursuit of wild boars and deer,
403.09	violent battles with scenes of fear and heroism.
408.94	I remember taking my son's school class. He was eight at the time,
413.102	and all the little boys, they kind of -- you know, they were little boys,
416.939	and then the thing that caught their attention
419.76	was in one of the hunting scenes there was a dog
422.869	pooping in the foreground — (Laughter) —
425.534	kind of an in-your-face joke by the artist.
429.216	And you can just imagine them.
431.69	But it brought it alive to them. I think they suddenly saw
435.063	that these weren't just old faded tapestries.
438.143	These were images of the world in the past,
442.634	and that it was the same for our audience.
445.55	And for me as a curator, I felt proud. I felt I'd shifted the needle a little.
451.107	Through this experience that could only be created
454.257	in a museum, I'd opened up the eyes of my audience --
458.34	historians, artists, press, the general public --
462.481	to the beauty of this lost medium.
467.157	A few years later, I was invited to be the director
470.731	of the museum, and after I got over that --
473.846	"""Who, me? The tapestry geek? I don't wear a tie!"" --"
479.357	I realized the fact: I believe passionately in that
484.737	curated museum experience.
488.016	We live in an age of ubiquitous information,
491.623	"and sort of ""just add water"" expertise,"
495.682	but there's nothing that compares with the presentation
499.724	of significant objects in a well-told narrative,
503.608	what the curator does, the interpretation of a complex,
508.668	esoteric subject, in a way that retains the integrity
513.179	of the subject, that makes it -- unpacks it
516.262	for a general audience.
518.429	And that, to me, today, is now the challenge and the fun
521.956	of my job, supporting the vision of my curators,
526.939	whether it's an exhibition of Samurai swords,
530.292	early Byzantine artifacts, Renaissance portraits,
535.376	or the show we heard mentioned earlier,
538.45	the McQueen show, with which we enjoyed
541.465	so much success last summer.
544.276	That was an interesting case.
546.777	In the late spring, early summer of 2010, shortly after
551.951	McQueen's suicide,
554.863	our curator of costume, Andrew Bolton, came to see me,
559.119	"and said, ""I've been thinking of doing a show on McQueen,"
562.354	"and now is the moment. We have to, we have to do it fast."""
566.912	It wasn't easy. McQueen had worked throughout his career
571.649	with a small team of designers and managers
575.103	who were very protective of his legacy,
579.245	but Andrew went to London and worked with them
581.079	over the summer and won their confidence, and that of
584.809	the designers who created his amazing fashion shows,
588.904	which were works of performance art in their own right,
593.518	and we proceeded to do something at the museum,
596.017	I think, we've never done before.
598.237	It wasn't just your standard installation.
601.254	In fact, we ripped down the galleries to recreate
605.444	entirely different settings, a recreation of his first studio,
610.856	a hall of mirrors,
613.729	a curiosity box,
616.257	a sunken ship, a burned-out interior,
619.617	with videos and soundtracks that ranged from
622.909	operatic arias to pigs fornicating.
626.642	And in this extraordinary setting, the costumes
631.603	were like actors and actresses, or living sculptures.
637.037	It could have been a train wreck.
639.216	It could have looked like shop windows on Fifth Avenue
643.675	at Christmas, but because of the way that Andrew
647.298	connected with the McQueen team, he was channeling
651.291	the rawness and the brilliance of McQueen,
654.715	and the show was quite transcendant,
657.522	and it became a phenomenon in its own right.
660.294	By the end of the show, we had people queuing
662.808	for four or five hours to get into the show,
666.31	but no one really complained.
668.937	"I heard over and over again, ""Wow, that was worth it."
672.015	"It was a such a visceral, emotive experience."""
676.094	Now, I've described two very immersive exhibitions,
680.351	but I also believe that collections, individual objects,
685.76	can also have that same power.
687.965	The Met was set up not as a museum of American art,
691.849	but of an encyclopedic museum,
694.954	and today, 140 years later, that vision
699.769	is as prescient as ever,
702.907	because, of course, we live in a world of crisis,
706.53	of challenge, and we're exposed to it
709.163	through the 24/7 newsreels.
712.312	It's in our galleries that we can unpack the civilizations,
717.172	the cultures, that we're seeing the current manifestation of.
721.552	Whether it's Libya, Egypt, Syria,
725.881	it's in our galleries that we can explain
728.591	and give greater understanding.
730.663	I mean, our new Islamic galleries are a case in point,
734.148	opened 10 years, almost to the week, after 9/11.
739.828	I think for most Americans, knowledge of the Islamic world
744.262	was pretty slight before 9/11, and then it was thrust upon us
748.113	in one of America's darkest hours,
752.206	and the perception was through the polarization
754.88	of that terrible event.
757.534	Now, in our galleries, we show 14 centuries
761.754	of the development of different Islamic cultures
766.207	across a vast geographic spread,
768.946	and, again, hundreds of thousands of people have come
772.973	to see these galleries since they opened last October.
778.148	"I'm often asked, ""Is digital media replacing the museum?"""
785.254	and I think those numbers are a resounding rejection
789.131	of that notion. I mean, don't get me wrong,
792.571	I'm a huge advocate of the Web.
795.846	It gives us a way of reaching out to audiences
799.265	around the globe, but nothing replaces the authenticity
804.666	of the object presented with passionate scholarship.
811.253	Bringing people face to face with our objects
815.856	is a way of bringing them face to face with people
819.303	across time, across space, whose lives may have been
823.869	very different to our own, but who, like us,
828.437	had hopes and dreams, frustrations and achievements
833.467	in their lives. And I think this is a process
836.646	that helps us better understand ourselves,
840.399	helps us make better decisions about where we're going.
845.907	The Great Hall at the Met is one of the great portals of the world,
851.309	awe-inspiring, like a medieval cathedral.
855.453	From there, you can walk in any direction
857.734	to almost any culture.
860.965	I frequently go out into the hall and the galleries
863.361	and I watch our visitors coming in.
866.436	Some of them are comfortable. They feel at home.
870.528	They know what they're looking for.
873.138	Others are very uneasy. It's an intimidating place.
877.594	They feel that the institution is elitist.
880.748	I'm working to try and break down that sense of that elitism.
886.943	I want to put people in a contemplative frame of mind,
890.891	where they're prepared to be a little bit lost, to explore,
897.048	to see the unfamiliar in the familiar,
900.87	or to try the unknown.
905.339	Because for us, it's all about bringing them face to face
909.68	with great works of art,
912.605	capturing them at that moment of discomfort,
917.005	when the inclination is kind of to reach for your iPhone,
920.501	your Blackberry, but to create a zone
925.904	where their curiosity can expand.
931.01	And whether it's in the expression of a Greek sculpture
934.574	that reminds you of a friend,
936.564	or a dog pooping in the corner of a tapestry,
940.844	or, to bring it back to my tutor Pietro,
944.254	those dancing figures
946.931	who are indeed knocking back the wine,
949.718	and that nude figure in the left foreground.
953.208	Wow. She is a gorgeous embodiment of youthful sexuality.
961.553	In that moment, our scholarship can tell you
967.175	that this is a bacchanal,
970.489	but if we're doing our job right,
973.64	and you've checked the jargon at the front door,
977.376	trust your instinct.
980.244	You know it's an orgy.
983.416	Thank you. (Applause)
986.734	(Applause)
