15.76	So my freshman year of college
17.204	I signed up for an internship in the housing unit
19.954	at Greater Boston Legal Services.
22.154	Showed up the first day
23.807	ready to make coffee and photocopies,
26.123	but was paired with this righteous, deeply inspired attorney
30.705	named Jeff Purcell,
32.174	who thrust me onto the front lines
34.639	from the very first day.
36.639	And over the course of nine months
38.404	I had the chance
39.417	to have dozens of conversations
41.189	with low-income families in Boston
43.973	who would come in presenting with housing issues,
47.089	but always had an underlying health issue.
50.373	So I had a client who came in,
52.605	about to be evicted because he hasn't paid his rent.
54.923	But he hasn't paid his rent, of course,
57.211	because he's paying for his HIV medication
59.705	and just can't afford both.
61.905	We had moms who would come in,
63.256	daughter has asthma,
64.639	wakes up covered in cockroaches every morning.
67.524	And one of our litigation strategies
69.497	was actually to send me into the home of these clients
72.272	with these large glass bottles.
74.405	And I would collect the cockroaches,
76.405	hot glue-gun them to this poster board
79.423	that we'd bring to court for our cases.
81.455	And we always won
82.733	because the judges were just so grossed out.
85.455	Far more effective, I have to say,
87.604	than anything I later learned in law school.
90.455	But over the course of these nine months,
93.005	I grew frustrated with feeling
94.856	like we were intervening too far downstream
97.822	in the lives of our clients --
100.339	that by the time they came to us,
101.871	they were already in crisis.
104.039	And at the end of my freshman year of college,
106.855	I read an article about the work
108.539	that Dr. Barry Zuckerman was doing
110.321	as Chair of Pediatrics
112.457	at Boston Medical Center.
113.857	And his first hire was a legal services attorney
116.924	to represent the patients.
118.806	So I called Barry,
120.321	and with his blessing, in October 1995
122.924	walked into the waiting room
124.989	of the pediatrics clinic at Boston Medical Center.
127.855	I'll never forget,
129.188	the TVs played this endless reel of cartoons.
132.072	And the exhaustion of mothers
135.006	who had taken two, three, sometimes four buses
138.538	to bring their child to the doctor
140.47	was just palpable.
142.354	The doctors, it seemed,
143.602	never really had enough time for all the patients,
145.121	try as they might.
146.371	And over the course of six months,
147.589	I would corner them in the hallway
149.27	and ask them a sort of naive but fundamental question:
153.171	"""If you had unlimited resources,"
155.656	"what's the one thing you would give your patients?"""
158.971	And I heard the same story again and again,
161.671	a story we've heard hundreds of times since then.
164.621	"They said, ""Every day we have patients that come into the clinic --"
168.186	child has an ear infection,
169.887	I prescribe antibiotics.
171.82	But the real issue is there's no food at home.
174.653	The real issue
176.154	is that child is living with 12 other people
178.388	in a two-bedroom apartment.
179.886	And I don't even ask about those issues
181.736	because there's nothing I can do.
184.487	I have 13 minutes with each patient.
186.325	Patients are piling up in the clinic waiting room.
188.894	I have no idea where the nearest food pantry is.
191.579	"And I don't even have any help."""
193.927	In that clinic, even today,
195.127	there are two social workers
196.813	for 24,000 pediatric patients,
199.544	which is better than a lot of the clinics out there.
202.396	So Health Leads was born of these conversations --
205.427	a simple model
206.611	where doctors and nurses
208.126	can prescribe nutritious food,
210.344	heat in the winter
211.646	and other basic resources for their patients
214.228	the same way they prescribe medication.
216.779	Patients then take their prescriptions
218.76	to our desk in the clinic waiting room
221.227	where we have a core of well-trained college student advocates
225.044	who work side by side with these families
227.496	to connect them out
228.795	to the existing landscape of community resources.
232.011	So we began with a card table in the clinic waiting room --
235.56	totally lemonade stand style.
237.71	But today we have a thousand college student advocates
241.03	who are working to connect nearly 9,000 patients and their families
245.33	with the resources that they need to be healthy.
248.531	So 18 months ago
250.047	I got this email that changed my life.
252.832	And the email was from Dr. Jack Geiger,
255.247	who had written to congratulate me on Health Leads
258.231	and to share, as he said,
259.53	a bit of historical context.
262.166	In 1965 Dr. Geiger founded
265.116	one of the first two community health centers in this country,
268.13	in a brutally poor area in the Mississippi Delta.
271.281	And so many of his patients came in
273.797	presenting with malnutrition
275.947	that be began prescribing food for them.
278.431	And they would take these prescriptions to the local supermarket,
281.682	which would fill them
282.78	and then charge the pharmacy budget of the clinic.
285.598	And when the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington, D.C. --
288.481	which was funding Geiger's clinic --
290.316	found out about this,
291.515	they were furious.
292.715	And they sent this bureaucrat down
294.464	to tell Geiger that he was expected to use their dollars
297.415	for medical care --
298.881	to which Geiger famously and logically responded,
302.281	"""The last time I checked my textbooks,"
304.706	"the specific therapy for malnutrition was food."""
309.065	(Laughter)
310.349	So when I got this email from Dr. Geiger,
313.048	I knew I was supposed to be proud
315.414	to be part of this history.
317.081	But the truth is
318.297	I was devastated.
320.289	Here we are,
325.615	and I have doctors telling me,
327.63	"""On those issues, we practice a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy."""
331.697	Forty-five years after Geiger,
334.13	Health Leads has to reinvent
335.681	the prescription for basic resources.
338.516	So I have spent hours upon hours
341.681	trying to make sense of this weird Groundhog Day.
345.015	How is it that if for decades
347.549	we had a pretty straightforward tool for keeping patients,
350.318	and especially low-income patients, healthy,
352.915	that we didn't use it?
354.816	If we know what it takes to have a healthcare system
357.915	rather than a sick-care system,
360.414	why don't we just do it?
362.447	These questions, in my mind,
364.681	are not hard because the answers are complicated,
367.747	they are hard because they require that we be honest with ourselves.
372.881	My belief is that it's almost too painful
375.981	to articulate our aspirations for our healthcare system,
379.21	or even admit that we have any at all.
381.948	Because if we did,
383.115	they would be so removed
384.731	from our current reality.
386.917	But that doesn't change my belief
389.88	that all of us, deep inside,
392.798	here in this room and across this country,
396.365	share a similar set of desires.
399.281	That if we are honest with ourselves
401.414	and listen quietly,
403.715	that we all harbor
405.531	one fiercely held aspiration for our healthcare:
409.731	that it keep us healthy.
411.831	This aspiration that our healthcare keep us healthy
415.148	is an enormously powerful one.
417.548	And the way I think about this
420.165	is that healthcare is like any other system.
422.349	It's just a set of choices that people make.
424.915	What if we decided
426.716	to make a different set of choices?
429.132	What if we decided to take all the parts of healthcare
432.164	that have drifted away from us
433.966	"and stand firm and say, ""No."
436.432	These things are ours.
438.399	They will be used for our purposes.
440.398	They will be used to realize
442.422	"our aspiration""?"
444.353	What if everything we needed
446.103	to realize our aspiration for healthcare
448.248	was right there in front of us
449.831	just waiting to be claimed?
451.715	So that's where Health Leads began.
453.765	We started with the prescription pad --
455.449	a very ordinary piece of paper --
457.848	and we asked, not what do patients need to get healthy --
461.816	antibiotics, an inhaler, medication --
464.834	but what do patients need to be healthy,
467.617	to not get sick in the first place?
470.164	And we chose to use the prescription
472.015	for that purpose.
473.797	So just a few miles from here
474.999	at Children's National Medical Center,
476.783	when patients come into the doctor's office,
479.049	they're asked a few questions.
480.734	"They're asked, ""Are you running out of food at the end of the month?"
483.398	"Do you have safe housing?"""
484.964	And when the doctor begins the visit,
487.033	she knows height, weight, is there food at home,
489.866	is the family living in a shelter.
491.482	And that not only leads to a better set of clinical choices,
494.366	but the doctor can also prescribe those resources for the patient,
498.416	using Health Leads like any other sub-specialty referral.
502.082	The problem is,
504.315	once you get a taste of what it's like
506.514	to realize your aspiration for healthcare,
508.749	you want more.
510.267	So we thought,
511.03	if we can get individual doctors
512.631	to prescribe these basic resources for their patients,
515.848	could we get an entire healthcare system
518.565	to shift its presumption?
521.317	And we gave it a shot.
522.564	So now at Harlem Hospital Center
523.999	when patients come in with an elevated body mass index,
527.785	the electronic medical record
529.649	automatically generates a prescription for Health Leads.
533.449	And our volunteers can then work with them
534.915	to connect patients to healthy food and excercise programs
538.132	in their communities.
539.564	We've created a presumption
540.698	that if you're a patient at that hospital
542.265	with an elevated BMI,
543.815	the four walls of the doctor's office
546.049	probably aren't going to give you everything
547.901	you need to be healthy.
549.083	You need more.
550.483	So on the one hand,
551.164	this is just a basic recoding
552.861	of the electronic medical record.
554.566	And on the other hand,
556.284	it's a radical transformation
557.933	of the electronic medical record
560.101	from a static repository of diagnostic information
563.983	to a health promotion tool.
566.817	In the private sector,
567.934	when you squeeze that kind of additional value
570.554	out of a fixed-cost investment,
572.301	it's called a billion-dollar company.
574.901	But in my world,
576.282	it's called reduced obesity and diabetes.
579.683	It's called healthcare --
581.566	a system where doctors can prescribe solutions
584.549	to improve health,
586.099	not just manage disease.
588.248	Same thing in the clinic waiting room.
589.782	So every day in this country
591.399	three million patients
592.899	pass through about 150,000 clinic waiting rooms in this country.
597.404	And what do they do when they're there?
599.377	They sit, they watch the goldfish in the fish tank,
602.827	they read extremely old copies
605.31	of Good Housekeeping magazine.
607.593	But mostly we all just sit there forever, waiting.
610.826	How did we get here
612.177	where we devote hundreds of acres and thousands of hours
615.526	to waiting?
617.309	What if we had a waiting room
618.526	where you don't just sit when you're sick,
620.627	but where you go to get healthy.
622.493	If airports can become shopping malls
625.01	and McDonald's can become playgrounds,
627.976	surely we can reinvent the clinic waiting room.
631.409	And that's what Health Leads has tried to do,
633.443	to reclaim that real estate and that time
635.726	and to use it as a gateway
637.158	to connect patients
638.21	to the resources they need to be healthy.
640.977	So it's a brutal winter in the Northeast,
642.493	your kid has asthma, your heat just got turned off,
644.96	and of course you're in the waiting room of the ER,
647.127	because the cold air triggered your child's asthma.
649.659	But what if instead of waiting for hours anxiously,
652.576	the waiting room became the place
654.776	where Health Leads turned your heat back on?
657.26	And of course all of this requires
658.878	a broader workforce.
660.826	But if we're creative, we already have that too.
663.993	We know that our doctors and nurses
666.379	and even social workers
667.726	aren't enough,
669.194	that the ticking minutes of health care
670.843	are too constraining.
672.261	Health just takes more time.
674.31	It requires a non-clinical army
677.109	of community health workers and case managers
679.793	and many others.
681.409	What if a small part of that next healthcare workforce
684.559	were the 11 million college students in this country?
688.26	Unencumbered by clinical responsibilities,
691.026	unwilling to take no for an answer
693.628	from those bureaucracies
695.21	that tend to crush patients,
697.143	and with an unparalleled ability
699.093	for information retrieval
700.545	honed through years of using Google.
703.526	Now lest you think it improbable
706.059	that a college volunteer
707.676	can make this kind of commitment,
709.459	I have two words for you:
711.026	March Madness.
713.377	The average NCAA Division I men's basketball player
717.344	dedicates 39 hours a week to his sport.
720.609	Now we may think that's good or bad,
722.761	but in either case it's real.
725.443	And Health Leads is based on the presumption
727.628	that for too long
729.01	we have asked too little of our college students
731.56	when it comes to real impact in vulnerable communities.
735.325	College sports teams say,
736.678	"""We're going to take dozens of hours"
738.743	at some field across campus at some ungodly hour of the morning
742.627	and we're going to measure your performance, and your team's performance,
745.443	and if you don't measure up or you don't show up,
747.609	we're going to cut you off the team.
749.059	But we'll make huge investments
750.947	in your training and development,
752.159	"and we'll give you an extraordinary community of peers."""
755.577	And people line up out the door
757.392	just for the chance to be part of it.
760.177	So our feeling is,
761.394	if it's good enough for the rugby team,
762.877	it's good enough for health and poverty.
764.992	Health Leads too recruits competitively,
768.26	trains intensively,
769.741	coaches professionally,
771.71	demands significant time,
773.659	builds a cohesive team
775.026	and measures results --
776.51	a kind of Teach for America for healthcare.
779.193	Now in the top 10 cities in the U.S.
781.293	with the largest number of Medicaid patients,
783.612	each of those has at least 20,000 college students.
786.826	New York alone has half a million college students.
790.027	And this isn't just a sort of short-term workforce
793.076	to connect patients to basic resources,
795.326	it's a next generation healthcare leadership pipeline
798.927	who've spent two, three, four years
801.377	in the clinic waiting room
802.878	talking to patients about their most basic health needs.
806.862	And they leave with the conviction,
808.611	the ability and the efficacy
810.443	to realize our most basic aspirations for health care.
814.226	And the thing is, there's thousands of these folks already out there.
817.244	So Mia Lozada is Chief Resident of Internal Medicine
821.061	at UCSF Medical Center,
822.476	but for three years as an undergraduate
824.809	she was a Health Leads volunteer
826.442	in the clinic waiting room at Boston Medical Center.
829.444	"Mia says, ""When my classmates write a prescription,"
833.159	they think their work is done.
835.177	When I write a prescription,
836.893	I think, can the family read the prescription?
839.16	Do they have transportation to the pharmacy?
841.343	Do they have food to take with the prescription?
843.793	Do they have insurance to fill the prescription?
846.043	Those are the questions I learned at Health Leads,
848.726	"not in medical school."""
850.476	Now none of these solutions --
852.46	the prescription pad, the electronic medical record,
855.43	the waiting room,
856.577	the army of college students --
857.745	are perfect.
858.928	But they are ours for the taking --
861.428	simple examples
862.76	of the vast under-utilized healthcare resources
866.261	that, if we reclaimed and redeployed,
869.176	could realize our most basic aspiration
872.593	of healthcare.
874.377	So I had been at Legal Services for about nine months
877.593	when this idea of Health Leads started percolating in my mind.
880.326	And I knew I had to tell Jeff Purcell, my attorney,
883.26	that I needed to leave.
884.679	And I was so nervous,
885.642	because I thought he was going to be disappointed in me
888.176	for abandoning our clients for some crazy idea.
891.226	And I sat down with him and I said,
893.21	"""Jeff, I have this idea"
895.093	that we could mobilize college students
897.512	"to address patients' most basic health needs."""
900.446	And I'll be honest,
902.027	all I wanted was for him to not be angry at me.
905.326	But he said this,
906.793	"""Rebecca, when you have a vision,"
910.141	you have an obligation to realize that vision.
913.992	"You must pursue that vision."""
917.093	"And I have to say, I was like ""Whoa."
920.359	"That's a lot of pressure."""
922.376	I just wanted a blessing,
923.775	I didn't want some kind of mandate.
925.326	But the truth is
926.893	I've spent every waking minute nearly since then
929.676	chasing that vision.
931.46	I believe that we all have a vision
934.642	for healthcare in this country.
936.543	I believe that at the end of the day
938.742	when we measure our healthcare,
940.576	it will not be by the diseases cured,
943.392	but by the diseases prevented.
945.91	It will not be by the excellence of our technologies
948.927	or the sophistication of our specialists,
951.427	but by how rarely we needed them.
954.226	And most of all,
955.71	I believe that when we measure healthcare,
958.227	it will be, not by what the system was,
960.91	but by what we chose it to be.
963.676	Thank you.
964.743	(Applause)
974.993	Thank you.
976.268	(Applause)
