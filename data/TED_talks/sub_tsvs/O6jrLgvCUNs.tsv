12.646	My name is Harry Baker.
12.646	Harry Baker is my name.
15.964	If your name was Harry Baker,
15.964	then our names would be the same.
20.867	(Laughter)
22.307	It's a short introductory part.
24.954	Yeah, I'm Harry.
26.486	I study maths. I write poetry.
29.063	So I thought I'd start
29.063	with a love poem about prime numbers.
33.266	(Laughter)
36.055	"This is called ""59."""
38.281	I was going to call it
38.281	"""Prime Time Loving."""
41.171	That reaction is why I didn't.
43.071	(Laughter)
44.56	"So, ""59."""
	side of the bed.
51.359	Realizes all his hair is 
51.359	on one side of his head.
53.91	Takes just under a minute to work out that
53.91	it’s because of the way that he slept.
57.797	He finds some clothes and gets dressed.
59.713	He can’t help but look in the mirror
59.713	and be subtly impressed
62.539	How he looks rough around the edges
62.539	and yet casually messed.
65.372	And as he glances out the window, he
65.372	sees the sight that he gets blessed with
68.993	of 60 from across the street.
70.495	Now 60 was beautiful.
72.288	With perfectly trimmed cuticles,
72.288	dressed in something suitable.
75.316	Never rude or crude at all.
76.753	Unimprovable, right on time as usual,
76.753	more on cue than a snooker ball
80.036	but liked to play it super cool.
	that he knew her favorite flower.
85.49	He thought of her every second,
85.49	every minute, every hour.
88.162	But he knew it wouldn’t work,
88.162	he’d never get the girl.
90.801	Because although she lived 
90.801	across the street
92.911	they came from different worlds.
94.451	While 59 admired 60’s
94.451	perfectly round figure,
	(Laughter)
103.957	One of his favorite films
103.957	"was ""101 Dalmatians."""
107.752	She preferred the sequel.
110.754	He romanticized the idea
110.754	they were star-crossed lovers.
113.87	They could overcome the odds
113.87	and evens because they had each other.
117.043	While she maintained the strict views
117.043	imposed on her by her mother
120.243	That separate could not be equal.
122.04	And though at the time he felt
122.04	stupid and dumb
124.208	For trying to love a girl controlled
124.208	by her stupid mum,
126.85	He should have been comforted
126.85	by the simple sum.
129.239	Take 59 away from 60,
129.239	and you’re left with the one.
131.669	Sure enough after two months
131.669	of moping around,
136.649	He had lost his keys 
136.649	and his parents were out.
138.871	So one day after school 
138.871	he went into a house
140.993	As he noticed the slightly wonky
140.993	numbers on the door,
143.506	He wondered why he’d never
143.506	introduced himself before,
145.991	As she let him in, his jaw 
145.991	dropped in awe.
	(Laughter)
151.308	She had prettier eyes,
151.308	and an approachable smile,
154.71	And like him, rough around
154.71	the edges, casual style,
157.136	And like him, everything
157.136	was in disorganized piles,
159.512	And like him, her mum didn’t mind
159.512	if friends stayed a while.
162.345	Because she was like him, 
162.345	and he liked her.
164.44	He reckoned she would like him
164.44	if she knew he was like her,
167.198	And it was different this time.
167.198	I mean, this girl was wicked,
170.076	So he plucked up the courage
170.076	and asked for her digits.
172.636	"She said, ""I'm 61."""
172.636	"He grinned, said, ""I'm 59."""
177.35	Today I’ve had a really nice time,
178.983	So tomorrow if you wanted
178.983	you could come over to mine?
181.556	"She said, ""Sure."""
182.419	She loved talking to someone 
182.419	just as quirky,
184.603	She agreed to this unofficial first date.
186.551	In the end he was only
186.551	ready one minute early,
188.711	But it didn’t matter because
188.711	she arrived one minute late.
191.435	And from that moment on
191.435	there was nonstop chatter,
193.879	"How they loved ""X Factor,"""
193.879	how they had two factors,
196.354	How that did not matter,
196.354	distinctiveness made them better,
200.454	By the end of the night they knew
200.454	they were meant together.
203.239	And one day she was talking
203.239	about stuck-up 60,
206.213	She noticed that 59 looked a bit shifty.
208.14	He blushed, told her of his crush:
209.837	“The best thing that never happened
209.837	because it led to us.”
	not prone to jealousy,
215.446	She looked him in the eyes
215.446	and told him quite tenderly,
218.148	"""You’re 59, I’m 61, together we combine"
218.148	"to become twice what 60 could ever be."""
223.14	(Laughter)
226.483	At this point 59 had tears in his eyes,
228.77	Was so glad to have
228.77	this one-of-a-kind girl in his life.
231.388	He told her the very
231.388	definition of being prime
233.588	Was that with only one
233.588	and himself could his heart divide,
236.345	And she was the one he wanted
236.345	to give his heart to,
238.769	She said she felt the same
238.769	and now she knew the films were half true.
242.098	Because that wasn't real love,
242.098	that love was just a sample,
244.919	When it came to real love,
244.919	they were a prime example.
248.193	Cheers.
249.888	(Applause)
260.522	That was the first poem that I wrote
262.334	and it was for a prime number-themed 
262.334	poetry night -- (Laughter) --
266.753	which turned out to be
266.753	a prime number-themed poetry competition.
269.973	And I became a prime number-themed
269.973	poetry competition winner,
273.2	or as I like to call it,
273.2	a prime minister. (Laughter)
276.709	And this is how I discovered
276.709	these things called poetry slams,
279.657	and if you don't know what 
279.657	a poetry slam is,
281.791	it was a format come up with
281.791	in America 30 years ago
284.485	as a way of tricking people
284.485	into going to poetry events
287.457	by putting an exciting word
287.457	"like ""slam"" on the end."
290.312	(Laughter)
291.706	And each performer got
291.706	three minutes to perform
294.608	and then random audience members
294.608	would hold up scorecards,
297.403	and they would end up
297.403	with a numerical score,
299.53	and what this meant is,
300.738	it kind of broke down the barrier
300.738	between performer and audience
303.943	and encouraged the kind
303.943	of connection with the listener.
306.653	And what it also means is you can win.
308.681	And if you win a poetry slam,
308.681	you can call yourself a slam champion
313.021	and pretend you're a wrestler,
315.412	and if you lose a poetry slam you can say,
315.412	"""Oh, what? Poetry's a subjective art form,"
319.476	"you can't put numbers on such things."""
321.774	(Laughter)
323.467	But I loved it, and I
323.467	got involved in these slams,
325.814	and I became the U.K. slam champion
328.113	and got invited to
328.113	the Poetry World Cup in Paris,
331.178	which was unbelievable.
332.617	It was people from all around the world
332.617	speaking in their native languages
336.133	to be judged by five French strangers.
338.585	(Laughter)
340.744	And somehow, I won, which was great,
344.715	and I've been able
344.715	to travel the world since doing it,
347.849	but it also means that this next piece
349.892	is technically the best poem in the world.
353.375	(Laughter)
357.369	So...
358.785	(Applause)
363.638	According to five French strangers.
366.633	"So this is ""Paper People."""
370.557	I like people.
372.636	I'd like some paper people.
374.992	They’d be purple paper people.
374.992	Maybe pop-up purple paper people.
378.173	Proper pop-up purple paper people.
380.913	"""How do you prop up"
380.913	"pop-up purple paper people?"""
383.839	I hear you cry. Well I ...
386.253	I’d probably prop up proper
386.253	pop-up purple paper people
389.011	with a proper pop-up
389.011	purple people paperclip,
392.662	but I’d pre-prepare appropriate
392.662	adhesives as alternatives,
395.399	a cheeky pack of Blu Tack
395.399	just in case the paper slipped.
398.171	Because I could build a pop-up metropolis.
400.254	but I wouldn’t wanna deal with all the
400.254	paper people politics.
403.135	paper politicians with their
403.135	paper-thin policies,
405.496	broken promises
405.496	without appropriate apologies.
407.72	There’d be a little paper me.
407.72	And a little paper you.
411.575	And we could watch paper TV
411.575	and it would all be pay-per-view.
414.799	(Laughter)
416.273	We’d see the poppy paper rappers
416.273	rap about their paper package
419.539	or watch paper people carriers
419.539	get stuck in paper traffic on the A4.
424.509	(Laughter) Paper.
427.248	There’d be a paper princess Kate
427.248	but we’d all stare at paper Pippa,
432.402	and then we’d all live in fear of
432.402	killer Jack the Paper-Ripper,
435.385	because the paper propaganda
435.385	propagates the people's prejudices,
438.439	papers printing pictures of the
438.439	photogenic terrorists.
441.095	A little paper me.
441.095	And a little paper you.
443.615	And in a pop-up population
443.615	people’s problems pop up too.
446.288	There’d be a pompous paper parliament
446.288	who remained out of touch,
449.295	and who ignored the people's protests
449.295	about all the paper cuts,
452.282	then the peaceful paper protests
452.282	would get blown to paper pieces,
455.524	by the confetti cannons
455.524	manned by pre-emptive police.
458.064	And yes there’d still be paper money,
458.064	so there’d still be paper greed,
461.639	and the paper piggy bankers
461.639	pocketing more than they need,
464.358	purchasing the potpourri
464.358	to pepper their paper properties,
467.106	others live in poverty
467.106	and ain’t acknowledged properly.
469.776	A proper poor economy
469.776	where so many are proper poor,
472.248	but while their needs are ignored
472.248	the money goes to big wars.
475.153	Origami armies
475.153	unfold plans for paper planes
477.245	and we remain imprisoned
477.245	in our own paper chains,
479.605	but the greater shame
479.605	is that it always seems to stay the same,
483.264	what changes is who’s in power
483.264	choosing how to lay the blame,
486.172	they’re naming names,
486.172	forgetting these are names of people,
489.611	because in the end
489.611	it all comes down to people.
492.697	I like people.
494.144	'Cause even when the situation’s dire,
495.965	it is only ever people
495.965	who are able to inspire,
498.224	and on paper,
498.224	it’s hard to see how we all cope.
501.459	But in the bottom of Pandora’s box
501.459	there’s still hope,
504.12	and I still hope
504.12	'cause I believe in people.
506.953	People like my grandparents.
509.275	Who every single day since I was born,
511.09	have taken time out of their morning
511.09	to pray for me.
514.305	That’s 7892 days straight
514.305	of someone checking I’m okay,
517.719	and that’s amazing.
519.713	People like my aunt who puts on
519.713	plays with prisoners.
522.417	People who are capable
522.417	of genuine forgiveness.
524.601	People like the persecuted Palestinians.
526.52	People who go out of their way
526.52	to make your life better,
529.174	and expect nothing in return.
530.868	You see, people have potential
530.868	to be powerful.
533.043	Just because the people in power
533.043	tend to pretend to be victims
536.198	we don’t need to succumb to that system.
538.25	And a paper population is no different.
540.595	There’s a little paper me.
540.595	And a little paper you.
544.313	And in a pop-up population
544.313	people's problems pop up too,
546.941	but even if the whole world fell apart
546.941	then we’d still make it through.
550.324	Because we’re people.
552.785	Thank you.
555.247	(Applause)
570.688	Thank you very much.
570.688	I've just got time for one more.
573.543	For me, poetry has been the ultimate way
573.543	of ideas without frontiers.
577.038	When I first started,
578.04	the people who inspired me
578.04	were the ones with the amazing stories,
581.145	and I thought, as an 18-year-old
581.145	with a happy life, it was too normal,
585.281	but I could create these worlds
585.281	where I could talk about my experiences
589.007	and dreams and beliefs.
590.331	So it's amazing to be here
590.331	in front of you today.
593.326	Thank you for being here.
594.742	If you weren't here,
596.019	it would be pretty much
596.019	like the sound check yesterday.
598.759	(Laughter)
600.826	And this is more fun.
603.403	So this last one is called
603.403	"""The Sunshine Kid."""
605.563	Thank you very much for listening.
608.697	Old man sunshine was proud of his sun,
612.087	And it brightened his day
612.087	to see his little boy run,
614.553	Not because of what he’d done,
614.553	nor the problems overcome,
617.219	But that despite that his disposition
617.219	remained a sunny one.
620.134	It hadn’t always been like this.
622.73	There’d been times when he’d tried
622.73	to hide his brightness,
625.461	You see, every star
625.461	hits periods of hardship,
627.597	It takes a brighter light
627.597	to inspire them through the darkness.
630.801	If we go back to when
630.801	he was born in a nebula,
633.155	We know that he never
633.155	was thought of as regular,
635.474	Because he had a flair about him,
637.21	To say the Midas touch is wrong
638.765	But all he went near
638.765	seemed to turn a little bronze,
641.203	Yes this sun was loved
641.203	by some more than others,
643.847	It was a case of Joseph
643.847	and his dreamcoat and his brothers
646.579	Because standing out from the crowd
646.579	had its pros and its cons,
649.516	And jealousy created enemies
649.516	in those he outshone
652.106	Such as the Shadow People.
653.417	Now the Shadow People
653.417	didn’t like the Sunshine Kid,
655.818	Because he showed up the dark things
655.818	the Shadow People did,
658.585	And when he shone he showed
658.585	the places where the Shadow People hid,
661.735	So the Shadow People had
661.735	an evil plan to get rid of him,
664.353	First up -- they made fun of his sunspots,
666.707	Shooting his dreams from the sky,
666.707	their words were gunshots,
669.525	Designed to remind him
669.525	he wasn’t very cool
672.103	And he didn’t fit in with any
672.103	popular kids at school.
674.587	They said his head was up in space
674.587	and they would bring him down to Earth,
678.152	Essentially he came from nothing
678.152	and that is what he was worth,
681.143	He’d never get to go
681.143	to university to learn,
683.277	Only degrees he’d ever show
683.277	would be the first degree burns
686.046	From those that came too close,
687.754	they told him he was too bright,
689.342	That’s why no one ever
689.342	looked him in the eyes,
691.519	His judgment became clouded
692.991	So did the sky,
692.991	With evaporated tears
694.915	as the sun started to cry.
696.158	Because the sunshine kid was bright,
696.158	with a warm personality,
701.405	And inside he burned savagely
703.332	Hurt by the words and curses
703.332	of the shadowy folk
705.701	who spoke holes in his soul
705.701	and left cavities,
708.278	And as his heart hardened,
708.278	his spark darkened,
712.016	Every time they called him names
712.016	it cooled his flames,
714.6	He thought they might like him
714.6	if he kept his light dim
717.277	But they were busy telling lightning
717.277	she had terrible aim,
720.468	He couldn’t quite get to grips
720.468	with what they said,
723.254	So he let his light be eclipsed
723.254	by what they said,
726.096	He fell into a Lone Star State like Texas,
728.235	And felt like he’d been punched
728.235	in his solar plexus.
730.661	But that’s when
730.661	Little Miss Sunshine came along
734.718	Singing her favorite song
734.718	about how we’re made to be strong,
737.65	And you don’t have to be wrong to belong,
737.65	Just be true to who you are,
741.156	because we are all stars at heart.
743.362	Little Miss Sunshine was hot stuff,
747.193	The kind of girl when you looked at her
749.458	you forgot stuff,
751.174	But for him, there was no forgetting her,
753.164	The minute he saw her
753.164	her image burned in his retina,
755.645	She was out of this world,
755.645	and she accepted him,
757.957	Something about this girl meant he knew
757.957	whenever she was next to him,
761.22	Things weren’t as dark as they seemed,
761.22	and he dared to dream,
764.121	Shadows were nowhere to be seen;
764.121	when she was there he beamed,
767.055	His eyes would light up
767.055	in ways that can’t be faked,
769.528	When she grinned her rays erased
769.528	the razor-tipped words of hate,
772.667	They gave each other nicknames,
772.667	"they were ""cool star"" and ""fun sun,"""
775.865	And gradually the shadowy
775.865	damage became undone,
778.615	She was one in a septillion,
778.615	and she was brilliant,
782.552	Could turn the coldest blooded
782.552	reptilians vermillion,
785.371	Loved by billions,
785.371	from Chileans to Brazilians,
788.038	And taught the Sunshine Kid
788.038	the meaning of resilience.
790.73	She said: “All the darkness in the world
793.562	cannot put out the light
793.562	from a single candle
796.836	So how the hell can they
796.836	handle your light?
798.946	Only you can choose to dim it,
798.946	and the sky is the limit,
801.875	so silence the critics by burning.”
803.692	And if eyes are windows to the soul
803.692	then she drew back the curtains
806.861	And let the sun shine
806.861	through the hurting.
808.841	In a universe of adversity
808.841	these stars stuck together,
811.429	And though days became nights
811.429	the memories would last forever,
814.335	Whether the weatherman
814.335	said it or not, it would be fine,
817.031	'Cause even behind the clouds
817.031	the kid could still shine.
819.668	Yes, the Sunshine Kid was bright,
819.668	with a warm personality,
822.531	And inside he burned savagely,
824.188	Fueled by the fire
824.188	inspired across galaxies
827.532	By the girl who showed him belief.
830.318	Thank you very much.
833.058	(Applause)
