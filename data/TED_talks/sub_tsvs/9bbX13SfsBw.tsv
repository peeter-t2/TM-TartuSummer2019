12.844	As a kid, I used to dream about the ocean.
15.461	It was this wild place
15.461	full of color and life,
19.812	home to these alien-looking,
19.812	fantastical creatures.
23.056	I pictured big sharks
23.056	ruling the food chain
25.498	and saw graceful sea turtles
25.498	dancing across coral reefs.
28.726	As a marine biologist turned photographer,
30.765	I've spent most of my career
30.765	looking for places
33.609	as magical as those I used
33.609	to dream about when I was little.
37.479	As you can see,
38.654	I began exploring bodies of water
38.654	at a fairly young age.
41.304	But the first time
41.304	I truly went underwater,
43.344	I was about 10 years old.
44.769	And I can still vividly remember
44.769	furiously finning
47.44	to reach this old, encrusted
47.44	cannon on a shallow coral reef.
50.939	And when I finally managed
50.939	to grab hold of it,
53.131	I looked up, and I was instantly
53.131	surrounded by fish
56.24	in all colors of the rainbow.
58.213	That was the day
58.213	I fell in love with the ocean.
60.84	Thomas Peschak
62.229	Conservation Photographer
64.991	In my 40 years on this planet,
66.665	I've had the great privilege to explore
68.547	some of its most incredible seascapes
70.659	for National Geographic Magazine
72.671	and the Save Our Seas Foundation.
74.322	I've photographed everything
74.322	from really, really big sharks
77.462	to dainty ones that fit
77.462	in the palm of your hand.
80.679	I've smelled the fishy, fishy breath
80.679	of humpback whales
83.655	feeding just feet away from me
85.29	in the cold seas off Canada's
85.29	Great Bear Rainforest.
88.138	And I've been privy to the mating rituals
88.138	of green sea turtles
91.099	in the Mozambique Channel.
92.461	Everyone on this planet affects
92.461	and is affected by the ocean.
96.209	And the pristine seas
96.209	I used to dream of as a child
98.986	are becoming harder and harder to find.
101.702	They are becoming more compressed
103.821	and more threatened.
105.691	As we humans continue to maintain our role
108.269	as the leading predator on earth,
110.634	I've witnessed and photographed
110.634	many of these ripple effects firsthand.
115.077	For a long time, I thought
115.077	I had to shock my audience
118.273	out of their indifference
118.273	with disturbing images.
120.606	And while this approach has merits,
122.53	I have come full circle.
124.368	I believe that the best way
124.368	for me to effect change
127.011	is to sell love.
128.632	I guess I'm a matchmaker of sorts
130.703	and as a photographer,
132.212	I have the rare opportunity
134.046	to reveal animals and entire ecosystems
136.392	that lie hidden beneath
136.392	the ocean's surface.
139.457	You can't love something
139.457	and become a champion for it
142.266	if you don't know it exists.
144.425	Uncovering this -- that is the power
144.425	of conservation photography.
149.154	(Music)
152.561	I've visited hundreds of marine locations,
155.385	but there are a handful of seascapes
157.335	that have touched me incredibly deeply.
160.928	The first time I experienced
160.928	that kind of high
163.67	was about 10 years ago,
165.087	off South Africa's rugged, wild coast.
167.946	And every June and July,
169.316	enormous shoals of sardines
169.316	travel northwards
171.749	in a mass migration
171.749	we call the Sardine Run.
174.098	And boy, do those fish
174.098	have good reason to run.
176.731	In hot pursuit are hoards
176.731	of hungry and agile predators.
181.044	Common dolphins hunt together
182.926	and they can separate some
182.926	of the sardines from the main shoal
185.871	and they create bait balls.
187.299	They drive and trap the fish upward
187.299	against the ocean surface
191.011	and then they rush in to dine
192.603	on this pulsating and movable feast.
195.438	Close behind are sharks.
197.258	Now, most people believe
198.437	that sharks and dolphins
198.437	are these mortal enemies,
200.838	but during the Sardine Run,
200.838	they actually coexist.
203.634	In fact, dolphins actually
203.634	help sharks feed more effectively.
207.829	Without dolphins, the bait balls
207.829	are more dispersed
211.435	and sharks often end up
211.435	with what I call a sardine donut,
215.197	or a mouth full of water.
216.681	Now, while I've had a few spicy moments
216.681	with sharks on the sardine run,
220.746	I know they don't see me as prey.
222.836	However, I get bumped and tail-slapped
222.836	just like any other guest
226.063	at this rowdy, rowdy banquet.
229.785	From the shores of Africa we travel east,
232.738	across the vastness
232.738	that is the Indian Ocean
234.863	to the Maldives, an archipelago
234.863	of coral islands.
238.779	And during the stormy southwest monsoon,
241.341	manta rays from all across the archipelago
243.675	travel to a tiny speck
243.675	in Baa Atoll called Hanifaru.
246.952	Armies of crustaceans,
248.159	most no bigger than the size
248.159	of your pupils,
250.397	are the mainstay of the manta ray's diet.
254.185	When plankton concentrations
254.185	become patchy,
256.992	manta rays feed alone
258.202	and they somersault themselves
258.202	backwards again and again,
260.938	very much like a puppy
260.938	chasing its own tail.
263.757	(Music)
267.011	However, when plankton densities increase,
269.528	the mantas line up head-to-tail
269.528	to form these long feeding chains,
273.751	and any tasty morsel that escapes
273.751	the first or second manta in line
277.099	is surely to be gobbled up
277.099	by the next or the one after.
281.912	As plankton levels peak in the bay,
283.832	the mantas swim closer and closer together
286.061	in a unique behavior
286.061	we call cyclone feeding.
288.852	And as they swirl in tight formation,
291.146	this multi-step column of mantas
292.841	creates its own vortex, sucking in
292.841	and delivering the plankton
296.742	right into the mantas' cavernous mouths.
299.574	The experience of diving
299.574	amongst such masses of hundreds of rays
303.94	is truly unforgettable.
306.881	(Music)
354.248	When I first photographed Hanifaru,
355.953	the site enjoyed no protection
357.539	and was threatened by development.
359.186	And working with NGOs
359.186	like the Manta Trust,
361.313	my images eventually helped Hanifaru
363.218	become a marine-protected area.
365.669	Now, fisherman from neighboring islands,
367.769	they once hunted these manta rays
369.463	to make traditional drums
369.463	from their skins.
372.111	Today, they are the most ardent
372.111	conservation champions
375.81	and manta rays earn the Maldivian economy
378.111	in excess of 8 million dollars
378.111	every single year.
383.182	I have always wanted
383.182	to travel back in time
385.555	to an era where maps were mostly blank
388.169	"or they read, ""There be dragons."""
390.122	And today, the closest I've come
390.122	is visiting remote atolls
393.73	in the western Indian Ocean.
395.446	Far, far away from shipping lanes
395.446	and fishing fleets,
398.691	diving into these waters
398.691	is a poignant reminder
402.049	of what our oceans once looked like.
404.501	Very few people have heard
404.501	of Bassas da India,
407.154	a tiny speck of coral
407.154	in the Mozambique Channel.
411.202	Its reef forms a protective outer barrier
414.369	and the inner lagoon is a nursery ground
417.069	for Galapagos sharks.
418.608	These sharks are anything but shy,
418.608	even during the day.
423.239	I had a bit of a hunch
423.239	that they'd be even bolder
425.882	and more abundant at night.
428.072	(Music)
436.179	Never before have I encountered
438.076	so many sharks on a single coral outcrop.
441.373	Capturing and sharing moments like this --
445.48	that reminds me why I chose my path.
449.488	Earlier this year, I was on assignment
449.488	for National Geographic Magazine
453.27	in Baja California.
454.912	And about halfway down the peninsula
454.912	on the Pacific side
457.673	lies San Ignacio Lagoon,
459.136	a critical calving ground for gray whales.
461.674	For 100 years, this coast was the scene
461.674	of a wholesale slaughter,
465.964	where more than 20,000
465.964	gray whales were killed,
468.4	leaving only a few hundred survivors.
470.698	Today the descendents of these same whales
473.392	nudge their youngsters to the surface
475.279	to play and even interact with us.
479.247	(Music)
488.577	This species truly has made
488.577	a remarkable comeback.
494.568	Now, on the other side
494.568	of the peninsula lies Cabo Pulmo,
497.563	a sleepy fishing village.
499.26	Decades of overfishing
499.26	had brought them close to collapse.
502.718	In 1995, local fisherman
502.718	convinced the authorities
505.202	to proclaim their waters a marine reserve.
507.478	But what happened next
507.478	was nothing short of miraculous.
511.055	In 2005, after only
511.055	a single decade of protection,
515.349	scientists measured the largest
515.349	recovery of fish ever recorded.
519.866	But don't take my word
519.866	for it -- come with me.
522.301	On a single breath, swim with me in deep,
525.063	into one of the largest
525.063	and densest schools of fish
528.119	I have ever encountered.
531.485	(Music)
543.135	We all have the ability
543.135	to be creators of hope.
545.993	And through my photography,
547.945	I want to pass on the message
547.945	that it is not too late for our oceans.
551.432	And particularly, I want to focus
551.432	on nature's resilience
554.891	in the face of 7.3 billion people.
558.901	My hope is that in the future,
560.742	I will have to search much, much harder
562.716	to make photographs like this,
564.925	while creating images that showcase
567.034	our respectful coexistence with the ocean.
570.077	Those will hopefully become
570.077	an everyday occurrence for me.
574.836	To thrive and survive in my profession,
577.135	you really have to be a hopeless optimist.
580.152	And I always operate on the assumption
582.197	that the next great picture
582.197	that will effect change
585.326	is right around the corner,
587.153	behind the next coral head,
589.51	inside the next lagoon
591.136	or possibly, in the one after it.
