12.76	On January 26, 2013,
15.48	a band of al-Qaeda militants
15.48	entered the ancient city of Timbuktu
19	on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert.
21.64	There, they set fire to a medieval library
21.64	of 30,000 manuscripts
26.28	written in Arabic
26.28	and several African languages
29.08	and ranging in subject from astronomy
29.08	to geography, history to medicine,
34.84	including one book which records
36.56	perhaps the first treatment
36.56	for male erectile dysfunction.
41.76	Unknown in the West,
43.08	this was the collected wisdom
43.08	of an entire continent,
46.52	the voice of Africa at a time when Africa
46.52	was thought not to have a voice at all.
51.48	The mayor of Bamako,
51.48	who witnessed the event,
54	called the burning of the manuscripts
55.96	"""a crime against world cultural heritage."""
58.88	And he was right --
60.44	or he would have been, if it weren't
60.44	for the fact that he was also lying.
64.56	In fact, just before,
67.32	African scholars had collected
67.32	a random assortment of old books
71.48	and left them out
71.48	for the terrorists to burn.
74	Today, the collection
74	lies hidden in Bamako,
76.959	the capital of Mali,
78.36	moldering in the high humidity.
80.48	What was rescued by ruse
82.36	is now once again in jeopardy,
84.12	this time by climate.
86.2	But Africa, and the far-flung
86.2	corners of the world,
88.64	are not the only places,
88.64	or even the main places
90.96	in which manuscripts that could change
90.96	the history of world culture
95.28	are in jeopardy.
97.92	Several years ago, I conducted
97.92	a survey of European research libraries
102.68	and discovered that,
102.68	at the barest minimum,
104.96	there are 60,000 manuscripts
108.2	pre-1500
109.84	that are illegible
109.84	because of water damage,
112.8	fading, mold and chemical reagents.
116.8	The real number is likely double that,
119.8	and that doesn't even count
122	Renaissance manuscripts
122	and modern manuscripts
124.64	and cultural heritage
124.64	objects such as maps.
129.96	What if there were a technology
132.44	that could recover
132.44	these lost and unknown works?
137.8	Imagine worldwide
137.8	how a trove of hundreds of thousands
142.24	of previously unknown texts
145.2	could radically transform
145.2	our knowledge of the past.
150.28	Imagine what unknown classics
150.28	we would discover
154.32	which would rewrite the canons
154.32	of literature, history,
157.68	philosophy, music --
159.84	or, more provocatively, that could
159.84	rewrite our cultural identities,
163.4	building new bridges
163.4	between people and culture.
167.52	These are the questions
167.52	that transformed me
170.08	from a medieval scholar,
170.08	a reader of texts,
172.92	into a textual scientist.
176.12	"What an unsatisfying word ""reader"" is."
178.44	For me, it conjures up
178.44	images of passivity,
181.04	of someone sitting idly in an armchair
183.48	waiting for knowledge to come to him
185.8	in a neat little parcel.
187.52	How much better to be
187.52	a participant in the past,
190.56	an adventurer in an undiscovered country,
193.76	searching for the hidden text.
197.36	As an academic, I was a mere reader.
200.56	I read and taught the same classics
203	that people had been reading
203	and teaching for hundreds of years --
206.16	Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, Petrarch --
209.2	and with every scholarly article
209.2	that I published
211.56	I added to human knowledge
211.56	in ever-diminishing slivers of insight.
216.76	What I wanted to be
218.36	was an archaeologist of the past,
220.48	a discoverer of literature,
222.08	an Indiana Jones without the whip --
224	or, actually, with the whip.
225.52	(Laughter)
226.76	And I wanted it not just for myself
226.76	but I wanted it for my students as well.
230.48	And so six years ago,
230.48	I changed the direction of my career.
234.4	At the time, I was working
234.4	"on ""The Chess of Love,"""
237.44	the last important long poem
237.44	of the European Middle Ages
240.32	never to have been edited.
241.96	And it wasn't edited because
241.96	it existed in only one manuscript
245	which was so badly damaged
245	during the firebombing of Dresden
248.28	in World War II
249.52	that generations of scholars
249.52	had pronounced it lost.
253.4	For five years, I had been working
253.4	with an ultraviolet lamp
256.88	trying to recover traces of the writing
258.8	and I'd gone about as far
258.8	as technology at the time
261.24	could actually take me.
262.64	And so I did what many people do.
264.76	I went online,
266.8	and there I learned about
268.56	how multispectral imaging had been used
268.56	to recover two lost treatises
273.16	of the famed Greek
273.16	mathematician Archimedes
276.08	from a 13th-century palimpsest.
277.64	A palimpsest is a manuscript
277.64	which has been erased and overwritten.
282.2	And so, out of the blue,
283.48	I decided to write
283.48	to the lead imaging scientist
286.56	on the Archimedes palimpsest project,
288.8	Professor Roger Easton,
290.32	with a plan and a plea.
292.16	And to my surprise,
292.16	he actually wrote back.
296	With his help, I was able
296	to win a grant from the US government
299.68	to build a transportable,
299.68	multispectral imaging lab,
303.72	And with this lab, I transformed
303.72	what was a charred and faded mess
308.56	into a new medieval classic.
311.36	So how does multispectral
311.36	imaging actually work?
314.16	Well, the idea
314.16	behind multispectral imaging
316.64	is something that anyone who is familiar
316.64	with infrared night vision goggles
320.96	will immediately appreciate:
322.36	that what we can see
322.36	in the visible spectrum of light
324.88	is only a tiny fraction
324.88	of what's actually there.
327.72	The same is true with invisible writing.
331.28	Our system uses 12 wavelengths of light
335.48	between the ultraviolet and the infrared,
338	and these are shown down
338	onto the manuscript from above
341.08	from banks of LEDs,
342.72	and another multispectral light source
344.6	which comes up through
344.6	the individual leaves of the manuscript.
347.577	Up to 35 images per sequence
347.577	per leaf are imaged this way
352.12	using a high-powered digital camera
352.12	equipped with a lens
354.764	which is made out of quartz.
356.76	There are about five
356.76	of these in the world.
358.88	And once we capture these images,
360.72	we feed them through
360.72	statistical algorithms
362.8	to further enhance and clarify them,
365.32	using software which was originally
365.32	designed for satellite images
368.72	and used by people
368.72	like geospatial scientists
372.12	and the CIA.
374.04	The results can be spectacular.
376.36	You may already have heard
376.36	of what's been done
378.56	for the Dead Sea Scrolls,
379.96	which are slowly gelatinizing.
382.48	Using infrared, we've been able
382.48	to read even the darkest corners
386.16	of the Dead Sea Scrolls.
388.88	You may not be aware, however,
390.36	of other Biblical texts
390.36	that are in jeopardy.
393.12	Here, for example,
393.12	is a leaf from a manuscript
396.56	that we imaged,
398.36	which is perhaps the most valuable
398.36	Christian Bible in the world.
402.88	The Codex Vercellensis is the oldest
402.88	translation of the Gospels into Latin,
408.68	and it dates from the first half
408.68	of the fourth century.
412.56	This is the closest we can come
414.84	to the Bible at the time
414.84	of the foundation of Christendom
418.8	under Emperor Constantine,
420.44	and at the time also
420.44	of the Council of Nicaea,
423	when the basic creed of Christianity
423	was being agreed upon.
426.52	This manuscript, unfortunately,
426.52	has been very badly damaged,
429.8	and it's damaged because for centuries
432.04	it had been used and handled
434.52	in swearing in ceremonies in the church.
437.24	In fact, that purple splotch
437.24	that you see in the upper left hand corner
441.92	is Aspergillus, which is a fungus
446.24	which originates in the unwashed hands
449.8	of a person with tuberculosis.
452.64	Our imaging has enabled me
452.64	to make the first transcription
455.72	of this manuscript in 250 years.
459.8	Having a lab that can travel
459.8	to collections where it's needed, however,
463.28	is only part of the solution.
465.48	The technology is expensive and very rare,
468.36	and the imaging and image
468.36	processing skills are esoteric.
471.6	That means that mounting recoveries
473.32	is beyond the reach of most researchers
473.32	and all but the wealthiest institutions.
478.24	That's why I founded the Lazarus Project,
481.04	a not-for-profit initiative
482.72	to bring multispectral imaging
482.72	to individual researchers
486.72	and smaller institutions
486.72	at little or no cost whatsoever.
491.56	Over the past five years,
493.2	our team of imaging scientists,
493.2	scholars and students
497.08	has travelled to seven different countries
499.28	and have recovered some of the world's
499.28	most valuable damaged manuscripts,
503.16	included the Vercelli Book,
503.16	which is the oldest book of English,
506.184	the Black Book of Carmarthen,
506.184	the oldest book of Welsh,
508.824	and some of the most valuable
508.824	earliest Gospels
512.32	located in what is now
512.32	the former Soviet Georgia.
516.6	So, spectral imaging
516.6	can recover lost texts.
520.36	More subtly, though, it can recover
520.36	a second story behind every object,
525.48	the story of how, when
525.48	and by whom a text was created,
530.2	and, sometimes, what the author
530.2	was thinking at the time he wrote.
534.6	Take, for example, a draft
534.6	of the Declaration of Independence
537.72	written in Thomas Jefferson's own hand,
540.16	which some colleagues of mine
540.16	imaged a few years ago
542.613	at the Library of Congress.
544.36	Curators had noticed
544.36	that one word throughout
547.08	had been scratched out and overwritten.
549.48	"The word overwritten was ""citizens."""
552.24	Perhaps you can guess
552.24	what the word underneath was.
555.96	"""Subjects."""
557.4	There, ladies and gentlemen,
557.4	is American democracy
560.24	evolving under the hand
560.24	of Thomas Jefferson.
563.36	Or consider the 1491 Martellus Map,
567.24	which we imaged
567.24	at Yale's Beinecke Library.
569.6	This was the map
569.6	that Columbus likely consulted
572.08	before he traveled to the New World
573.8	and which gave him his idea
573.8	of what Asia looked like
576.56	and where Japan was located.
579.64	The problem with this map
579.64	is that its inks and pigments
582.68	had so degraded over time
584.8	that this large, nearly seven-foot map,
586.96	made the world look like a giant desert.
589.52	Until now, we had very little idea,
589.52	detailed idea, that is,
593.16	of what Columbus knew of the world
594.84	and how world cultures were represented.
597.24	The main legend of the map
597.24	was entirely illegible under normal light.
601.4	Ultraviolet did very little for it.
603.68	Multispectral gave us everything.
606.64	In Asia, we learned of monsters
606.64	with ears so long
610.24	that they could cover
610.24	the creature's entire body.
613.04	In Africa, about a snake
613.04	who could cause the ground to smoke.
618.68	Like starlight, which can convey images
620.96	of the way the Universe
620.96	looked in the distant past,
623.56	so multispectral light can take us back
623.56	to the first stuttering moments
627.48	of an object's creation.
629.48	Through this lens, we witness
629.48	the mistakes, the changes of mind,
633.44	the naïvetés, the uncensored thoughts,
636.36	the imperfections of the human imagination
638.6	that allow these hallowed objects
638.6	and their authors
641.44	to become more real,
643.12	that make history closer to us.
646.76	What about the future?
648.48	There's so much of the past,
650.68	and so few people
650.68	with the skills to rescue it
653.92	before these objects disappear forever.
658.48	That's why I have begun to teach
658.48	this new hybrid discipline
661.8	"that I call ""textual science."""
663.72	Textual science is a marriage
665.36	of the traditional skills
665.36	of a literary scholar --
667.76	the ability to read old languages
667.76	and old handwriting,
670.32	the knowledge of how texts are made
672.04	in order to be able
672.04	to place and date them --
674.2	with new techniques like imaging science,
676.96	the chemistry of inks and pigments,
679.56	computer-aided optical
679.56	character recognition.
683.16	Last year, a student in my class,
685.36	a freshman,
686.6	with a background in Latin and Greek,
688.44	was image-processing a palimpsest
690.8	that we had photographed
690.8	at a famous library in Rome.
694.24	As he worked, tiny Greek writing
694.24	began to appear from behind the text.
700.2	Everyone gathered around,
701.72	and he read a line from a lost work
704.4	of the Greek comic dramatist Menander.
707.76	This was the first time
707.76	in well over a thousand years
710.48	that those words
710.48	had been pronounced aloud.
713.88	In that moment, he became a scholar.
717.44	Ladies and gentlemen,
717.44	that is the future of the past.
720.84	Thank you very much.
722.08	(Applause)
