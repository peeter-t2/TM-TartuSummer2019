15.871	I have the answer to a question that we've all asked.
19.472	The question is,
20.589	Why is it that the letter X
22.873	represents the unknown?
24.871	Now I know we learned that in math class,
27.838	but now it's everywhere in the culture --
29.589	The X prize, the X-Files,
32.39	Project X, TEDx.
36.313	Where'd that come from?
38.308	About six years ago
39.526	I decided that I would learn Arabic,
42.242	which turns out to be a supremely logical language.
46.194	To write a word or a phrase
48.511	or a sentence in Arabic
50.192	is like crafting an equation,
52.425	because every part is extremely precise
54.791	and carries a lot of information.
57.643	That's one of the reasons
58.993	so much of what we've come to think of
60.508	as Western science and mathematics and engineering
64.327	was really worked out in the first few centuries of the Common Era
67.649	by the Persians and the Arabs and the Turks.
70.965	This includes the little system in Arabic
73.282	called al-jebra.
74.998	And al-jebr roughly translates to
78.166	"""the system for reconciling disparate parts."""
81.865	Al-jebr finally came into English as algebra.
85.915	One example among many.
88.082	The Arabic texts containing this mathematical wisdom
92.048	finally made their way to Europe --
93.831	which is to say Spain --
95.117	in the 11th and 12th centuries.
97.582	And when they arrived
98.732	there was tremendous interest
100.615	in translating this wisdom
102.349	into a European language.
103.998	But there were problems.
106.016	One problem
107.733	is there are some sounds in Arabic
110.366	that just don't make it through a European voice box
113.365	without lots of practice.
115.632	Trust me on that one.
117.366	Also, those very sounds
119.583	tend not to be represented
121.497	by the characters that are available in European languages.
125.085	Here's one of the culprits.
126.899	This is the letter SHeen,
128.783	"and it makes the sound we think of as SH -- ""sh."""
132.382	It's also the very first letter
134.984	of the word shalan,
137.416	"which means ""something"""
139.21	"just like the the English word ""something"" --"
141.058	some undefined, unknown thing.
144.344	Now in Arabic,
145.509	we can make this definite
146.71	"by adding the definite article ""al."""
148.858	So this is al-shalan --
151.46	the unknown thing.
153.11	And this is a word that appears throughout early mathematics,
156.413	such as this 10th century derivation of proofs.
163.613	The problem for the Medieval Spanish scholars
166.123	who were tasked with translating this material
168.691	is that the letter SHeen and the word shalan
173.173	can't be rendered into Spanish
175.123	because Spanish doesn't have that SH,
177.709	"that ""sh"" sound."
179.006	So by convention,
180.588	they created a rule in which
182.254	"they borrowed the CK sound, ""ck"" sound,"
186.472	from the classical Greek
188.22	in the form of the letter Kai.
190.901	Later when this material was translated
193.62	into a common European language,
195.968	which is to say Latin,
198.018	they simply replaced the Greek Kai
200.051	with the Latin X.
202.401	And once that happened,
203.67	once this material was in Latin,
206.135	it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks
209.718	for almost 600 years.
211.801	But now we have the answer to our question.
213.819	Why is it that X is the unknown?
216.6	X is the unknown
218.423	"because you can't say ""sh"" in Spanish."
222.205	(Laughter)
224.589	And I thought that was worth sharing.
226.906	(Applause)
