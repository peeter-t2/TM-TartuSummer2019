12.532	Let's talk dirty.
16.644	A few years ago, oddly enough,
19.38	I needed the bathroom,
22.114	and I found one, a public bathroom,
25.464	and I went into the stall,
27.828	and I prepared to do what I'd done most of my life:
31.125	use the toilet, flush the toilet, forget about the toilet.
35.667	And for some reason that day, instead,
37.748	I asked myself a question,
39.932	and it was, where does this stuff go?
43.808	And with that question, I found myself plunged
47.7	into the world of sanitation --
51.724	there's more coming -- (Laughter) —
53.289	sanitation, toilets and poop,
57.858	and I have yet to emerge.
60.931	And that's because it's such an enraging,
63.236	yet engaging place to be.
66.452	To go back to that toilet,
69.708	it wasn't a particularly fancy toilet,
72.502	it wasn't as nice as this one
73.937	from the World Toilet Organization.
76.868	That's the other WTO. (Laughter)
81.135	But it had a lockable door, it had privacy, it had water,
84.749	it had soap so I could wash my hands,
87.013	and I did because I'm a woman, and we do that.
90.077	(Laughter) (Applause)
95.685	But that day, when I asked that question,
98.096	I learned something, and that was that I'd grown up thinking
100.829	that a toilet like that was my right,
103.044	when in fact it's a privilege.
106.222	2.5 billion people worldwide have no adequate toilet.
111.481	They don't have a bucket or a box.
115.421	Forty percent of the world with no adequate toilet.
119.629	And they have to do what this little boy is doing
122.126	by the side of the Mumbai Airport expressway,
125.061	which is called open defecation,
127.709	or poo-pooing in the open.
131.064	And he does that every day,
133.298	and every day, probably, that guy in the picture
135.797	walks on by,
137.651	because he sees that little boy, but he doesn't see him.
141.109	But he should, because the problem
143.229	with all that poop lying around
145.589	is that poop carries passengers.
148.597	Fifty communicable diseases like to travel in human shit.
152.896	All those things, the eggs, the cysts,
155.317	the bacteria, the viruses, all those can travel
158.093	in one gram of human feces.
161.501	How? Well, that little boy will not have washed his hands.
165.213	He's barefoot. He'll run back into his house,
167.709	and he will contaminate his drinking water and his food
171.364	and his environment
172.768	with whatever diseases he may be carrying
175.165	by fecal particles that are on his fingers and feet.
180.914	In what I call the flushed-and-plumbed world
183.186	that most of us in this room are lucky to live in,
185.813	the most common symptoms associated with those diseases,
188.862	diarrhea, is now a bit of a joke.
191.688	It's the runs, the Hershey squirts, the squits.
195.379	Where I come from, we call it Delhi belly,
197.229	as a legacy of empire.
199.837	But if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea
203.577	in a leading photo image agency,
206.368	this is the picture that you come up with.
208.388	(Laughter)
210.253	Still not sure about the bikini.
215.432	And here's another image of diarrhea.
217.928	This is Marie Saylee, nine months old.
221.04	You can't see her, because she's buried
222.839	under that green grass in a little village in Liberia,
226.122	because she died in three days from diarrhea --
229.684	the Hershey squirts, the runs, a joke.
233.313	And that's her dad.
235.792	But she wasn't alone that day,
237.354	because 4,000 other children died of diarrhea,
241.154	and they do every day.
243.824	Diarrhea is the second biggest killer of children worldwide,
248.823	and you've probably been asked to care about things
251.495	like HIV/AIDS or T.B. or measles,
254.656	but diarrhea kills more children
256	than all those three things put together.
259.712	It's a very potent weapon of mass destruction.
264.054	And the cost to the world is immense:
269.691	on the losses to poor sanitation.
272.684	These are cholera beds in Haiti.
274.365	You'll have heard of cholera, but we don't hear about diarrhea.
277.864	It gets a fraction of the attention and funding
280.048	given to any of those other diseases.
283.764	But we know how to fix this.
286.176	We know, because in the mid-19th century,
289.696	wonderful Victorian engineers
292.085	installed systems of sewers and wastewater treatment
294.888	and the flush toilet, and disease dropped dramatically.
299.599	Child mortality dropped by the most
301.508	it had ever dropped in history.
303.698	The flush toilet was voted the best medical advance
306.644	of the last 200 years by the readers of the British Medical Journal,
309.824	and they were choosing over the Pill, anesthesia,
312.667	and surgery.
314.075	It's a wonderful waste disposal device.
316.796	But I think that it's so good — it doesn't smell,
320.414	we can put it in our house, we can lock it behind a door —
323.193	and I think we've locked it out of conversation too.
326.197	We don't have a neutral word for it.
327.852	Poop's not particularly adequate.
329.795	Shit offends people. Feces is too medical.
333.92	Because I can't explain otherwise,
336.112	when I look at the figures, what's going on.
339.68	We know how to solve diarrhea and sanitation,
342.254	but if you look at the budgets of countries,
344.584	developing and developed,
346.905	you'll think there's something wrong with the math,
349.456	because you'll expect absurdities like
352.282	Pakistan spending 47 times more on its military
355.164	than it does on water and sanitation,
357.445	even though 150,000 children die of diarrhea
360.253	in Pakistan every year.
362.352	But then you look at that already minuscule
364.312	water and sanitation budget,
366.206	and 75 to 90 percent of it will go on clean water supply,
369.69	which is great; we all need water.
371.643	No one's going to refuse clean water.
373.95	But the humble latrine, or flush toilet,
376.901	reduces disease by twice as much
379.01	as just putting in clean water.
381.434	Think about it. That little boy
382.745	who's running back into his house,
384.6	he may have a nice, clean fresh water supply,
386.71	but he's got dirty hands that he's going to contaminate his water supply with.
391.17	And I think that the real waste of human waste
394.674	is that we are wasting it as a resource
397.442	and as an incredible trigger for development,
401.202	because these are a few things that toilets
403.352	and poop itself can do for us.
406.282	So a toilet can put a girl back in school.
409.458	Twenty-five percent of girls in India drop out of school
412.29	because they have no adequate sanitation.
415.808	They've been used to sitting through lessons
417.573	for years and years holding it in.
420.49	We've all done that, but they do it every day,
423.25	and when they hit puberty and they start menstruating,
425.806	it just gets too much.
428.149	And I understand that. Who can blame them?
431.69	So if you met an educationalist and said,
433.616	"""I can improve education attendance rates by 25 percent"
436.49	"with just one simple thing,"""
438.688	you'd make a lot of friends in education.
441.501	That's not the only thing it can do for you.
444.036	Poop can cook your dinner.
447.096	It's got nutrients in it.
448.79	We ingest nutrients. We excrete nutrients as well.
451.251	We don't keep them all.
453.103	In Rwanda, they are now getting
458.574	from the contents of prisoners' bowels.
461.936	So these are a bunch of inmates in a prison in Butare.
465.722	They're genocidal inmates, most of them,
467.874	and they're stirring the contents of their own latrines,
471.522	because if you put poop in a sealed environment, in a tank,
474.833	pretty much like a stomach,
476.589	then, pretty much like a stomach, it gives off gas,
479.402	and you can cook with it.
481.427	And you might think it's just good karma
483.57	to see these guys stirring shit,
486.042	but it's also good economic sense,
488.342	because they're saving a million dollars a year.
490.408	They're cutting down on deforestation,
492.414	and they've found a fuel supply that is inexhaustible,
495.317	infinite and free at the point of production.
500.059	It's not just in the poor world that poop can save lives.
503.407	Here's a woman who's about to get a dose
505.559	of the brown stuff in those syringes,
507.312	which is what you think it is,
509.248	except not quite, because it's actually donated.
512.292	There is now a new career path called stool donor.
515.174	It's like the new sperm donor.
516.994	Because she has been suffering from a superbug called C. diff,
519.987	and it's resistant to antibiotics in many cases.
523.431	She's been suffering for years.
524.943	She gets a dose of healthy human feces,
528.035	and the cure rate for this procedure is 94 percent.
532.516	It's astonishing, but hardly anyone is still doing it.
536.914	Maybe it's the ick factor.
538.936	That's okay, because there's a team of research scientists
541.806	in Canada who have now created a stool sample,
544.783	a fake stool sample which is called RePOOPulate.
547.567	So you'd be thinking by now, okay, the solution's simple,
549.855	we give everyone a toilet.
551.74	And this is where it gets really interesting,
553.893	because it's not that simple, because we are not simple.
556.818	So the really interesting, exciting work --
560.911	this is the engaging bit -- in sanitation is that
563.847	we need to understand human psychology.
566.175	We need to understand software
568.551	as well as just giving someone hardware.
570.903	They've found in many developing countries that
572.685	governments have gone in and given out free latrines
575.407	and gone back a few years later and found that they've
577.563	got lots of new goat sheds or temples or spare rooms
581.686	with their owners happily walking past them
584.053	and going over to the open defecating ground.
587.863	So the idea is to manipulate human emotion.
590.887	It's been done for decades. The soap companies did it
593.388	in the early 20th century.
595.327	They tried selling soap as healthy. No one bought it.
598.086	They tried selling it as sexy. Everyone bought it.
602.253	In India now there's a campaign
603.608	which persuades young brides
606.154	not to marry into families that don't have a toilet.
609.252	"It's called ""No Loo, No I Do."""
611.92	(Laughter)
614.267	And in case you think that poster's just propaganda,
616.242	here's Priyanka, 23 years old.
618.342	I met her last October in India,
620.463	and she grew up in a conservative environment.
623.52	She grew up in a rural village in a poor area of India,
626.616	and she was engaged at 14, and then at 21 or so,
630.782	she moved into her in-law's house.
632.553	And she was horrified to get there and find
634.588	that they didn't have a toilet.
635.88	She'd grown up with a latrine.
637.247	It was no big deal, but it was a latrine.
639.201	And the first night she was there, she was told
641.224	that at 4 o'clock in the morning --
642.431	her mother-in-law got her up, told her to go outside
645.27	and go and do it in the dark in the open.
648.09	And she was scared. She was scared of drunks hanging around.
650.16	She was scared of snakes. She was scared of rape.
653.034	After three days, she did an unthinkable thing.
655.516	She left.
657.256	And if you know anything about rural India,
658.841	you'll know that's an unspeakably courageous thing to do.
662.319	But not just that.
663.376	She got her toilet, and now she goes around
665.788	all the other villages in India
667.386	persuading other women to do the same thing.
669.139	It's what I call social contagion, and it's really powerful
672.6	and really exciting.
674.775	Another version of this, another village in India
676.864	near where Priyanka lives
678.861	is this village, called Lakara, and about a year ago,
682.736	it had no toilets whatsoever.
684.187	Kids were dying of diarrhea and cholera.
686.481	Some visitors came, using various behavioral change tricks
690.823	like putting out a plate of food and a plate of shit
693.617	and watching the flies go one to the other.
695.834	Somehow, people who'd been thinking
698.401	that what they were doing was not disgusting at all
699.93	"suddenly thought, ""Oops."""
701.802	Not only that, but they were ingesting their neighbors' shit.
704.129	That's what really made them change their behavior.
707.257	So this woman, this boy's mother
709.793	installed this latrine in a few hours.
712.278	Her entire life, she'd been using the banana field behind,
714.661	but she installed the latrine in a few hours.
716.229	It cost nothing. It's going to save that boy's life.
719.902	So when I get despondent about the state of sanitation,
723.093	even though these are pretty exciting times
725.289	because we've got the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
727.867	reinventing the toilet, which is great,
729.929	we've got Matt Damon going on bathroom strike,
732.483	which is great for humanity, very bad for his colon.
736.218	But there are things to worry about.
737.932	It's the most off-track Millennium Development Goal.
740.69	It's about 50 or so years off track.
743.036	We're not going to meet targets,
744.372	providing people with sanitation at this rate.
747.657	So when I get sad about sanitation,
751.138	I think of Japan, because Japan 70 years ago
754.457	was a nation of people who used pit latrines
757.046	and wiped with sticks,
759.178	and now it's a nation of what are called Woshurettos,
762.505	washlet toilets.
763.985	They have in-built bidet nozzles for a lovely,
766.329	hands-free cleaning experience,
769.074	and they have various other features
771.246	like a heated seat and an automatic lid-raising device
774.221	"which is known as the ""marriage-saver."""
776.562	(Laughter)
778.018	But most importantly, what they have done in Japan,
780.423	which I find so inspirational,
781.923	is they've brought the toilet out from behind the locked door.
784.487	They've made it conversational.
785.988	People go out and upgrade their toilet.
789.39	They talk about it. They've sanitized it.
793.798	I hope that we can do that. It's not a difficult thing to do.
798.278	All we really need to do
800.548	is look at this issue
802.39	as the urgent, shameful issue that it is.
806.702	And don't think that it's just in the poor world that things are wrong.
809.475	Our sewers are crumbling.
811.639	Things are going wrong here too.
813.806	The solution to all of this is pretty easy.
816.705	I'm going to make your lives easy this afternoon
818.426	and just ask you to do one thing,
820.779	and that's to go out, protest,
823.855	speak about the unspeakable,
826.093	and talk shit.
827.632	Thank you.
829.586	(Applause)
