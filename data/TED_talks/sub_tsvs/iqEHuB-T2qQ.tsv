12.88	Welcome to Bayeku,
15.12	a riverine community in Ikorodu, Lagos --
18.52	a vivid representation of several
18.52	riverine communities across Nigeria,
24.92	communities whose waterways
24.92	have been infested
28.92	by an invasive aquatic weed;
31.8	communities where economic livelihoods
31.8	have been hampered:
37.08	fishing, marine transportation
40.32	and trading;
41.6	communities where fish yields
41.6	have diminished;
45.8	communities where schoolchildren
45.8	are unable to go to school
50.44	for days, sometimes weeks, on end.
54.76	Who would have thought that this plant
57.64	with round leaves, inflated stems,
57.64	and showy, lavender flowers
64.4	would cause such havoc
64.4	in these communities.
68.2	The plant is known as water hyacinth
71	and its botanical name,
71	Eichhornia crassipes.
74.32	Interestingly, in Nigeria,
74.32	the plant is also known by other names,
78.88	names associated with historical events,
81.76	as well as myths.
83.68	In some places,
83.68	the plant is called Babangida.
87.8	When you hear Babangida, you remember
87.8	the military and military coups.
92.96	And you think: fear, restraint.
96.32	In parts of Nigeria in the Niger Delta,
96.32	the plant is also known as Abiola.
101.72	When you hear Abiola,
101.72	you remember annulled elections
106.16	and you think: dashed hopes.
108.8	In the southwestern part of Nigeria,
111.36	the plant is known as Gbe'borun.
113.6	Gbe'borun is a Yoruba phrase
115.4	"which translates to ""gossip,"""
115.4	"or ""talebearer."""
119.4	When you think of gossip, you think:
119.4	rapid reproduction, destruction.
125.24	And in the Igala-speaking part of Nigeria,
127.8	the plant is known as A Kp'iye Kp'oma,
130.68	And when you hear that,
130.68	you think of death.
133.4	It literally translates
133.4	"to ""death to mother and child."""
138.28	I personally had my encounter
138.28	with this plant in the year 2009.
143.16	It was shortly after I had relocated
143.16	from the US to Nigeria.
148.92	I'd quit my job in corporate America
151.48	and decided to take
151.48	this big leap of faith,
154.68	a leap of faith that came
154.68	out of a deep sense of conviction
158.2	that there was a lot of work
158.2	to do in Nigeria
160.36	in the area of sustainable development.
162.84	And so here I was in the year 2009,
165.84	actually, at the end of 2009,
168	in Lagos on the Third Mainland Bridge.
171.04	And I looked to my left
171.04	and saw this very arresting image.
175.72	It was an image of fishing boats
177.52	that had been hemmed in
177.52	by dense mats of water hyacinth.
183.28	And I was really pained by what I saw
185.68	because I thought to myself,
187.2	"""These poor fisherfolk,"
189.08	how are they going
189.08	to go about their daily activities
193.96	"with these restrictions."""
196.08	And then I thought,
196.08	"""There's got to be a better way."""
199.16	A win-win solution whereby
199.16	the environment is taken care of
204.2	by the weeds being cleared out of the way
206.6	and then this being turned
206.6	into an economic benefit
209.76	for the communities
209.76	whose lives are impacted the most
212.6	by the infestation of the weed.
215.16	That, I would say, was my spark moment.
218.76	And so I did further research
218.76	to find out more
222.24	about the beneficial uses of this weed.
225.2	Out of the several,
225.2	one struck me the most.
228.64	It was the use of the plant
228.64	for handicrafts.
231.76	"And I thought, ""What a great idea."""
234.12	Personally, I love handicrafts,
236.52	especially handicrafts
236.52	that are woven around a story.
241.2	"And so I thought, ""This could be"
241.2	easily deployed within the communities
245.84	without the requirement
245.84	"of technical skills."""
249.4	And I thought to myself,
249.4	"""Three simple steps to a mega solution."""
255.04	First step: Get out into the waterways
255.04	and harvest the water hyacinth.
260.16	That way, you create access.
262.48	Secondly, you dry
262.48	the water hyacinth stems.
267.08	And thirdly, you weave
267.08	the water hyacinth into products.
272.519	The third step was a challenge.
274.92	See, I'm a computer scientist
274.92	by background
277.64	and not someone in the creative arts.
280.32	And so I began my quest
282.04	to find out how I can learn how to weave.
285	And this quest took me
285	to a community in Ibadan, where I lived,
289.16	called Sabo.
290.6	"Sabo translates to ""strangers' quarters."""
293.48	And the community is
293.48	predominantly made up of people
296.52	from the northern part of the country.
298.52	So I literally took
298.52	my dried weeds in hand,
301.48	there were several more of them,
303.08	and went knocking from door to door
303.08	to find out who could teach me
306.44	how to weave these
306.44	water hyacinth stems into ropes.
310.88	And I was directed
310.88	to the shed of Malam Yahaya.
314.88	The problem, though,
314.88	is that Malam Yahaya doesn't speak English
317.92	and neither did I speak Hausa.
320.04	But some little kids came to the rescue
322.2	and helped translate.
324	And that began my journey
324	of learning how to weave
327.28	and transform these
327.28	dried water hyacinth stems
331.88	into long ropes.
335.4	With my long ropes in hand,
337.68	I was now equipped to make products.
340.8	And that was the beginning
340.8	of partnerships.
343.24	Working with rattan basket makers
343.24	to come up with products.
347.24	So with this in hand, I felt confident
350.04	that I would be able
350.04	to take this knowledge
352.064	back into the riverine communities
354.64	and help them to transform
354.64	their adversity into prosperity.
359.92	So taking these weeds
359.92	and actually weaving them
363.12	into products that can be sold.
365.72	So we have pens, we have tableware,
369.48	we have purses, we have tissue boxes.
373.28	Thereby, helping the communities
375.84	to see water hyacinth
375.84	in a different light.
379.04	Seeing water hyacinth as being valuable,
381.72	being aesthetic,
381.72	being durable, tough, resilient.
387.88	Changing names, changing livelihoods.
391.28	From Gbe'borun, gossip,
394.28	to Olusotan, storyteller.
397.12	And from A Kp'iye Kp'oma,
397.12	"which is ""killer of mother and child,"""
401.16	to Ya du j'ewn w'Iye kp'Oma,
403.52	"""provider of food for mother and child."""
406.92	And I'd like to end
406.92	with a quote by Michael Margolis.
410.8	"He said, ""If you want to learn"
410.8	about a culture, listen to the stories.
415.84	And if you want to change a culture,
415.84	"change the stories."""
419.92	And so, from Makoko community,
419.92	to Abobiri, to Ewoi,
425.04	to Kolo, to Owahwa, Esaba,
428.72	we have changed the story.
431.32	Thank you for listening.
432.88	(Applause)
