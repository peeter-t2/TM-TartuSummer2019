12.7	I just want to share with you
14.18	what I have been experiencing
14.18	over the last five years
16.78	in having the great privilege of traveling
19.1	to many of the poorest
19.1	countries in the world.
21.34	This scene is one
21.34	I see all the time everywhere,
25.26	and these young children
25.26	are looking at a smartphone,
28.42	and the smartphone is having a huge impact
28.42	in even the poorest countries.
32.94	I said to my team, you know,
34.58	what I see is a rise in aspirations
34.58	all over the world.
38.34	In fact, it seems to me
38.34	that there's a convergence of aspirations.
42.54	And I asked a team of economists
42.54	to actually look into this.
46.18	Is this true?
47.42	Are aspirations converging
47.42	all around the world?
50.26	So they looked at things like Gallup polls
50.26	about satisfaction in life
54.54	and what they learned was
54.54	that if you have access to the internet,
59.02	your satisfaction goes up.
61.14	But another thing happens
61.14	that's very important:
64.02	your reference income,
65.94	the income to which you compare your own,
68.62	also goes up.
70.1	Now, if the reference income
70.1	of a nation, for example,
73.54	goes up 10 percent
74.94	by comparing themselves to the outside,
77.18	then on average,
79.46	people's own incomes
79.46	have to go up at least five percent
82.54	to maintain the same
82.54	level of satisfaction.
85.1	But when you get down
85.1	into the lower percentiles of income,
89.1	your income has to go up much more
91.34	if the reference income
91.34	goes up 10 percent,
93.42	something like 20 percent.
95.02	And so with this rise of aspirations,
97.54	the fundamental question is:
99.38	Are we going to have a situation
100.98	where aspirations
100.98	are linked to opportunity
104.18	and you get dynamism and economic growth,
106.94	like that which happened
106.94	in the country I was born in, in Korea?
110.7	Or are aspirations
110.7	going to meet frustration?
115.74	This is a real concern,
115.74	because between 2012 and 2015,
120.22	terrorism incidents
120.22	increased by 74 percent.
123.18	The number of deaths from terrorism
123.18	went up 150 percent.
127.46	Right now, two billion people
129.34	live in conditions
129.34	of fragility, conflict, violence,
131.94	and by 2030, more than 60 percent
131.94	of the world's poor
137.42	will live in these situations
137.42	of fragility, conflict and violence.
141.38	And so what do we do
141.38	about meeting these aspirations?
144.34	Are there new ways of thinking
146.06	about how we can rise
146.06	to meet these aspirations?
149.1	Because if we don't,
149.1	I'm extremely worried.
152.14	Aspirations are rising as never before
152.14	because of access to the internet.
156.5	Everyone knows how everyone else lives.
159.02	Has our ability to meet those aspirations
161.94	risen as well?
163.38	And just to get at the details of this,
165.34	I want to share with you
165.34	my own personal story.
167.78	This is not my mother,
169.82	but during the Korean War,
171.54	my mother literally took her own sister,
174.02	her younger sister, on her back,
175.94	and walked at least part of the way
178.38	to escape Seoul during the Korean War.
182.1	Now, through a series of miracles,
185.02	my mother and father both got
185.02	scholarships to go to New York City.
189.14	They actually met in New York City
189.14	and got married in New York City.
193.78	My father, too, was a refugee.
196.02	At the age of 19, he left his family
196.02	in the northern part of the country,
200.42	escaped through the border
202.1	and never saw his family again.
204.46	Now, when they were married
204.46	and living in New York,
207.62	my father was a waiter
207.62	at Patricia Murphy's restaurant.
210.58	Their aspirations went up.
212.74	They understood what it was like
212.74	to live in a place like New York City
216.7	in the 1950s.
218.58	Well, my brother was born
218.58	and they came back to Korea,
222.66	and we had what I remember
222.66	as kind of an idyllic life,
226.7	but what was happening
226.7	in Korea at that time
229.18	was the country was one
229.18	of the poorest in the world
232.38	and there was political upheaval.
234.02	There were demonstrations just down
234.02	the street from our house all the time,
237.58	students protesting
237.58	against the military government.
242.46	And at the time,
244.5	the aspirations of the World Bank Group,
244.5	the organization I lead now,
247.98	were extremely low for Korea.
250.86	Their idea was that Korea would
250.86	find it difficult without foreign aid
254.9	to provide its people with more
254.9	than the bare necessities of life.
259.26	So the situation is
259.26	Korea is in a tough position,
262.78	my parents have seen
262.78	what life is like in the United States.
265.66	They got married there.
265.66	My brother was born there.
268.06	And they felt that in order
268.06	to give us an opportunity
271.42	to reach their aspirations for us,
274.02	we had to go and come back
274.02	to the United States.
276.38	Now, we came back.
278.7	First we went to Dallas.
279.98	My father did his dental degree
279.98	all over again.
282.7	And then we ended up
282.7	moving to Iowa, of all places.
286.02	We grew up in Iowa.
287.78	And in Iowa, we went
287.78	through the whole course.
290.18	I went to high school, I went to college.
292.66	And then one day,
292.66	something that I'll never forget,
297.74	my father picked me up
297.74	after my sophomore year in college,
302.5	and he was driving me home,
303.86	"and he said, ""Jim,"
303.86	what are your aspirations?
306.02	What do you want to study?
306.02	"What do you want to do?"""
308.46	"And I said, ""Dad,"" --"
309.7	My mother actually was a philosopher,
309.7	and had filled us with ideas
312.98	about protest and social justice,
315.34	"and I said, ""Dad, I'm going to study"
315.34	political science and philosophy,
319.02	and I'm going to become
319.02	"part of a political movement."""
322.14	My father, the Korean dentist,
323.82	slowly pulled the car
323.82	over to the side of the road --
326.34	(Laughter)
328.02	He looked back at me, and he said,
329.74	"""Jim, you finish your medical residency,"
329.74	"you can study anything you want."""
333.241	(Laughter)
334.82	Now, I've told this story
334.82	to a mostly Asian audience before.
339.78	Nobody laughs. They just shake their head.
342.34	Of course.
343.58	(Laughter)
345.46	(Applause)
347.02	So, tragically,
347.02	my father died at a young age,
354.54	what happens to be how old I am right now,
357.06	and when he died in the middle
357.06	of my medical and graduate studies --
360.3	You see, I actually got around it
360.3	by doing medicine and anthropology.
363.74	I studied both of them in graduate school.
368.7	But then right about that time,
368.7	I met these two people,
371.66	Ophelia Dahl and Paul Farmer.
373.78	And Paul and I were in the same program.
375.82	We were studying medicine
377.42	and at the same time
377.42	getting our PhD's in anthropology.
380.18	And we began to ask
380.18	some pretty fundamental questions.
383.02	For people who have the great privilege
383.02	of studying medicine and anthropology --
387.94	I had come from parents who were refugees.
390.1	Paul grew up literally
390.1	in a bus in a swamp in Florida.
394.58	"He liked to call himself ""white trash."""
397.18	And so we had this opportunity
400.1	and we said,
401.34	what is it that we need to do?
402.82	Given our ridiculously
402.82	elaborate educations,
405.58	what is the nature
405.58	of our responsibility to the world?
408.94	And we decided that we needed
408.94	to start an organization.
412.22	It's called Partners in Health.
413.74	And by the way,
413.74	there's a movie made about that.
416.02	(Applause)
418.9	There's a movie
418.9	that was just a brilliant movie
421.14	they made about it
421.14	"called ""Bending the Arc."""
423.26	It launched at Sundance this past January.
425.7	Jeff Skoll is here.
426.94	Jeff is one of the ones
426.94	who made it happen.
429.9	And we began to think
429.9	about what it would take for us
434.74	to actually have our aspirations
434.74	reach the level
438.34	of some of the poorest
438.34	communities in the world.
440.62	This is my very first visit
440.62	to Haiti in 1988,
443.82	and in 1988, we elaborated
443.82	a sort of mission statement,
449.18	which is we are going to make
449.18	a preferential option for the poor
453.06	in health.
454.3	Now, it took us a long time, and we
454.3	were graduate students in anthropology.
457.86	We were reading up one side of Marx
457.86	and down the other.
460.5	Habermas. Fernand Braudel.
462.98	We were reading everything
464.66	and we had to come to a conclusion
464.66	of how are we going to structure our work?
468.74	"So ""O for the P,"" we called it,"
470.62	a preferential option for the poor.
473.38	The most important thing
473.38	about a preferential option for the poor
476.46	is what it's not.
478.18	It's not a preferential option
478.18	for your own sense of heroism.
482.46	It's not a preferential option
483.94	for your own idea about
483.94	how to lift the poor out of poverty.
487.54	It's not a preferential option
487.54	for your own organization.
490.46	And the hardest of all,
492.38	it's not a preferential option
492.38	for your poor.
495.66	It's a preferential option for the poor.
498.26	So what do you do?
499.7	Well, Haiti, we started building --
503.58	Everyone told us, the cost-effective thing
505.86	is just focus on vaccination
505.86	and maybe a feeding program.
509.02	But what the Haitians wanted
509.02	was a hospital.
512.82	They wanted schools.
514.1	They wanted to provide their children
514.1	with the opportunities
516.98	that they'd been hearing about
516.98	from others, relatives, for example,
521.02	who had gone to the United States.
522.94	They wanted the same kinds
522.94	of opportunities as my parents did.
527.979	I recognized them.
529.979	And so that's what we did.
529.979	We built hospitals.
532.18	We provided education.
534.02	And we did everything we could
534.02	to try to give them opportunities.
537.46	Now, my experience really became intense
540.14	at Partners in Health
540.14	in this community, Carabayllo,
543.42	in the northern slums of Lima, Peru.
548.02	And in this community,
549.26	we started out by really just going
549.26	to people's homes and talking to people,
552.9	and we discovered an outbreak, an epidemic
552.9	of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.
558.18	This is Melquiades.
559.46	Melquiades was a patient at that time,
559.46	he was about 18 years old,
564.3	and he had a very difficult form
564.3	of drug-resistant tuberculosis.
569.1	All of the gurus in the world,
569.1	the global health gurus,
571.9	said it is not cost-effective
571.9	to treat drug-resistant tuberculosis.
576.74	It's too complicated. It's too expensive.
578.717	You just can't do it. It can't be done.
581.58	And in addition,
581.58	they were getting angry at us,
584.78	because the implication was
586.34	if it could be done,
586.34	we would have done it.
588.74	Who do you think you are?
590.46	And the people that we fought with
590.46	were the World Health Organization
593.74	and probably the organization
593.74	we fought with most
596.9	was the World Bank Group.
598.46	Now, we did everything we could
602.7	to convince Melquiades
602.7	to take his medicines,
605.14	because it's really hard,
606.66	and not once during the time of treatment
606.66	did Melquiades's family ever say,
610.54	"""Hey, you know, Melquiades"
610.54	is just not cost-effective.
613.78	Why don't you go on
613.78	"and treat somebody else?"""
615.94	(Laughter)
617.26	I hadn't seen Melquiades
617.26	for about 10 years
619.54	and when we had
619.54	our annual meetings in Lima, Peru
622.66	a couple of years ago,
624.22	the filmmakers found him
626.46	and here is us getting together.
628.42	(Applause)
635.38	He has become a bit of a media star
635.38	because he goes to the film openings,
638.9	and he knows how to work an audience now.
641.22	(Laughter)
643.1	But as soon as we won --
645.26	We did win. We won the argument.
647.1	You should treat
647.1	multidrug-resistant tuberculosis --
649.98	we heard the same arguments
649.98	in the early 2000s about HIV.
653.94	All of the leading global health
653.94	people in the world said
656.86	it is impossible
656.86	to treat HIV in poor countries.
660.14	Too expensive, too complicated,
660.14	you can't do it.
662.62	Compared to drug-resistant TB treatment,
664.58	it's actually easier.
666.54	And we were seeing patients like this.
669.5	Joseph Jeune.
670.74	Joseph Jeune also never mentioned
670.74	that he was not cost-effective.
674.18	A few months of medicines,
674.18	and this is what he looked like.
677.02	(Applause)
679.46	We call that the Lazarus Effect
679.46	of HIV treatment.
681.98	Joseline came to us looking like this.
684.3	This is what she looked like
684.3	a few months later.
686.58	(Applause)
689.3	Now, our argument, our battle, we thought,
692.9	was with the organizations
692.9	that kept saying it's not cost-effective.
696.9	We were saying, no,
698.34	preferential option for the poor
698.34	requires us to raise our aspirations
702.26	to meet those of the poor for themselves.
704.237	And they said, well, that's a nice thought
704.237	but it's just not cost-effective.
707.9	So in the nerdy way
707.9	that we have operated Partners in Health,
714.46	we wrote a book against,
714.46	basically, the World Bank.
717.18	It says that because the World Bank
719.82	has focused so much
719.82	on just economic growth
723.7	and said that governments
723.7	have to shrink their budgets
727.5	and reduce expenditures
727.5	in health, education and social welfare --
731.58	we thought that was fundamentally wrong.
733.58	And we argued with the World Bank.
735.46	And then a crazy thing happened.
737.78	President Obama nominated me
737.78	to be President of the World Bank.
740.78	(Applause)
746.78	Now, when I went to do the vetting process
746.78	with President Obama's team,
751.62	"they had a copy of ""Dying For Growth,"""
751.62	and they had read every page.
755.14	"And I said, ""OK, that's it, right?"
756.9	"You guys are going to drop me?"""
758.46	"He goes, ""Oh, no, no, it's OK."""
760.9	And I was nominated,
762.3	and I walked through the door
762.3	of the World Bank Group in July of 2012,
766.94	and that statement on the wall,
766.94	"""Our dream is a world free of poverty."""
770.34	A few months after that,
770.34	we actually turned it into a goal:
773.34	end extreme poverty by 2030,
775.98	boost shared prosperity.
777.26	That's what we do now
777.26	at the World Bank Group.
779.46	I feel like I have brought
779.46	the preferential option for the poor
783.46	to the World Bank Group.
784.86	(Applause)
790.3	But this is TED,
791.58	and so I want to share
791.58	with you some concerns,
794.18	and then make a proposal.
796.86	The Fourth Industrial Revolution,
798.5	now, you guys know
798.5	so much better than I do,
800.62	but here's the thing that concerns me.
802.5	What we hear about is job loss.
802.5	You've all heard that.
805.06	Our own data suggest to us
805.06	that two thirds of all jobs,
807.7	currently existing jobs
807.7	in developing countries,
809.963	will be lost because of automation.
811.7	Now, you've got to make up for those jobs.
813.86	Now, one of the ways
813.86	to make up for those jobs
816.06	is to turn community health workers
816.06	into a formal labor force.
819.74	That's what we want to do.
821.02	(Applause)
822.3	We think the numbers will work out,
824.66	that as health outcomes get better
824.66	and as people have formal work,
828.46	we're going to be able to train them
830.22	with the soft-skills training
830.22	that you add to it
832.5	to become workers
832.5	that will have a huge impact,
836.06	and that may be the one area
836.06	that grows the most.
839.46	But here's the other thing
839.46	that bothers me:
842.06	right now it seems pretty clear to me
842.06	that the jobs of the future
845.98	will be more digitally demanding,
847.86	and there is a crisis
847.86	in childhood stunting.
851.82	So these are photos from Charles Nelson,
851.82	who shared these with us
855.42	from Harvard Medical School.
856.9	And what these photos show
856.9	on the one side, on the left side,
861.7	is a three-month-old who has been stunted:
866.14	not adequate nutrition,
866.14	not adequate stimulation.
868.7	And on the other side,
868.7	of course, is a normal child,
871.3	and the normal child
871.3	has all of these neuronal connections.
874.18	Now, the neuronal connections
874.18	are important,
876.66	because that is
876.66	the definition of human capital.
879.9	Now, we know that we
879.9	can reduce these rates.
883.62	We can reduce these rates
883.62	of childhood stunting quickly,
887.02	but if we don't, India, for example,
887.02	with 38 percent childhood stunting,
891.5	how are they going to compete
891.5	in the economy of the future
894.26	if 40 percent of their future workers
894.26	cannot achieve educationally
900.14	and certainly we worry
900.14	about achieving economically
903.9	in a way that will help
903.9	the country as a whole grow.
907.7	Now, what are we going to do?
	is the size of the global economy.
914.22	8.55 trillion dollars are sitting
914.22	in negative interest rate bonds.
918.14	That means that you give
918.14	the German central bank your money
922.62	and then you pay them to keep your money.
925.14	That's a negative interest rate bond.
	in very low-earning government bonds.
930.18	And 8 trillion literally sitting
930.18	in the hands of rich people
935.42	under their very large mattresses.
937.86	What we are trying to do
937.86	is now use our own tools --
941.82	and just to get nerdy for a second,
943.54	we're talking about
943.54	first-loss risk debt instruments,
946.06	we're talking about derisking,
946.06	blended finance,
948.66	we're talking about
948.66	political risk insurance,
951.18	credit enhancement --
952.42	all these things that I've now learned
952.42	at the World Bank Group
955.38	that rich people use every single day
955.38	to make themselves richer,
959.54	but we haven't used aggressively enough
959.54	on behalf of the poor
963.3	to bring this capital in.
964.94	(Applause)
972.1	So does this work?
974.26	Can you actually bring
974.26	private-sector players into a country
979.1	and really make things work?
980.5	Well, we've done it a couple of times.
982.38	This is Zambia, Scaling Solar.
984.62	It's a box-set solution
984.62	from the World Bank
986.82	where we come in
986.82	and we do all the things you need
989.26	to attract private-sector investors.
991.14	And in this case, Zambia went
991.14	from having a cost of electricity
995.74	at 25 cents a kilowatt-hour,
998.26	and by just doing simple things,
998.26	doing the auction,
1002.02	changing some policies,
1003.54	we were able to bring the cost down.
1006.54	Lowest bid,
1010.26	The lowest bid was 4.7 cents
1010.26	a kilowatt-hour. It's possible.
1014.46	(Applause)
1016.62	But here's my proposal for you.
1018.58	This is from a group called Zipline,
1020.5	a cool company, and they
1020.5	literally are rocket scientists.
1023.38	They figured out
1023.38	how to use drones in Rwanda.
1025.82	This is me launching a drone in Rwanda
1028.06	that delivers blood
1028.06	anywhere in the country
1031.02	in less than an hour.
1032.58	So we save lives,
1034.06	this program saved lives --
1035.939	(Applause)
1036.98	This program made money for Zipline
1038.74	and this program saved
1038.74	huge amounts of money for Rwanda.
1042.78	That's what we need,
1042.78	and we need that from all of you.
1045.5	I'm asking you, carve out
1045.5	a little bit of time in your brains
1048.78	to think about the technology
1048.78	that you work on,
1051.38	the companies that you start,
1051.38	the design that you do.
1054.02	Think a little bit and work with us
1056.98	to see if we can come up with these kinds
1056.98	of extraordinary win-win solutions.
1061.3	I'm going to leave you
1061.3	with one final story.
1064.7	I was in Tanzania,
1064.7	and I was in a classroom.
1067.02	This is me with a classroom
1067.02	of 11-year-olds.
1071.3	And I asked them, as I always do,
1072.94	"""What do you want to be when you grow up?"""
1075.02	Two raised their hands and said,
1076.78	"""I want to be President"
1076.78	"of the World Bank."""
1078.82	(Laughter)
1080.66	And just like you, my own team
1080.66	and their teachers laughed.
1084.1	But then I stopped them.
1085.66	"I said, ""Look, I want to tell you a story."
1088.86	When I was born in South Korea,
1088.86	this is what it looked like.
1093.1	This is where I came from.
1095.18	And when I was three years old,
1098.06	in preschool,
1100.14	I don't think that George David Woods,
1100.14	the President of the World Bank,
1103.54	if he had visited Korea on that day
1103.54	and come to my classroom,
1107.14	that he would have thought
1108.5	that the future President
1108.5	of the World Bank
1110.54	was sitting in that classroom.
1112.02	Don't let anyone ever tell you
1114.34	that you cannot be
1114.34	"President of the World Bank."""
1117.14	Now -- thank you.
1118.38	(Applause)
1119.98	Let me leave you with one thought.
1122.06	I came from a country
1122.06	that was the poorest in the world.
1124.74	I'm President of the World Bank.
1126.34	I cannot and I will not
1126.34	pull up the ladder behind me.
1129.54	This is urgent.
1131.1	Aspirations are going up.
1132.62	Everywhere aspirations are going up.
1134.94	You folks in this room, work with us.
1137.58	We know that we can find
1137.58	those Zipline-type solutions
1141.62	and help the poor
1141.62	leapfrog into a better world,
1144.94	but it won't happen
1144.94	until we work together.
1148.06	"The future ""you"" --"
1148.06	and especially for your children --
1150.82	the future you
1152.42	will depend on how much care
1152.42	and compassion we bring
1155.42	"to ensuring that the future ""us"""
1155.42	provides equality of opportunity
1160.06	for every child in the world.
1161.5	Thank you very much.
1162.78	(Applause)
1164.5	Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
1167.58	(Applause)
1172.86	Chris Anderson: You'd almost think
1174.54	people are surprised
1174.54	to hear a talk like this
1176.7	from the President of the World Bank.
1178.54	It's kind of cool.
1179.78	I'd encourage you to even be
1179.78	a little more specific on your proposal.
1183.06	There's many investors,
1183.06	entrepreneurs in this room.
1187.58	How will you partner with them?
1187.58	What's your proposal?
1190.1	Jim Yong Kim: Can I get nerdy
1190.1	for just a second.
1192.38	CA: Get nerdy. Absolutely.
1192.38	JYK: So here's what we did.
1194.98	Insurance companies never invest
1194.98	in developing country infrastructure,
1198.3	for example, because
1198.3	they can't take the risk.
1200.5	They're holding money
1200.5	for people who pay for insurance.
1203.14	So what we did was a Swedish
1203.14	International Development Association
1206.3	gave us a little bit of money,
1207.78	we went out and raised a little bit
1207.78	more money, a hundred million,
1210.94	and we took first loss,
1210.94	meaning if this thing goes bad,
1215.46	and the rest of you will be safe.
1217.26	And that created
1217.26	a 90-percent chunk, tranche
1221.02	that was triple B, investment-grade,
1221.02	so the insurance companies invested.
1224.5	So for us, what we're doing
1224.5	is taking our public money
1229.14	and using it to derisk
1229.14	specific instruments
1232.7	to bring people in from the outside.
1234.46	So all of you who are sitting
1234.46	on trillions of dollars of cash,
1237.42	come to us. Right?
1238.66	(Laughter)
1239.7	CA: And what you're specifically
1239.7	looking for are investment proposals
1242.98	that create employment
1242.98	in the developing world.
1245.22	JYK: Absolutely. Absolutely.
1246.62	So these will be, for example,
1246.62	in infrastructure that brings energy,
1250.38	builds roads, bridges, ports.
1252.86	These kinds of things
1252.86	are necessary to create jobs,
1255.62	but also what we're saying is
1257.94	you may think that the technology
1257.94	you're working on
1260.38	or the business that you're working on
1262.26	may not have applications
1262.26	in the developing world,
1265.34	but look at Zipline.
1266.7	And that Zipline thing didn't happen
1268.74	just because of the quality
1268.74	of the technology.
1270.94	It was because they engaged
1270.94	with the Rwandans early
1274.14	and used artificial intelligence --
1276.02	one thing, Rwanda has great broadband --
1278.9	but these things fly
1278.9	completely on their own.
1281.78	So we will help you do that.
1281.78	We will make the introductions.
1284.66	We will even provide financing.
1284.66	We will help you do that.
1287.38	CA: How much capital
1287.38	is the World Bank willing to deploy
1290.06	to back those kinds of efforts?
1291.62	JYK: Chris, you're always getting me
1291.62	to try to do something like this.
1294.94	CA: I'm trying to get you in trouble.
1294.94	JYK: So here's what we're going to do.
1298.54	We have 25 billion a year
1298.54	that we're investing in poor countries,
1303.3	the poorest countries.
1304.54	And as we invest
1304.54	over the next three years,
1308.06	we have got to think with you
1309.94	about how to use that money
1309.94	more effectively.
1312.1	So I can't give you a specific number.
1312.1	It depends on the quality of the ideas.
1315.94	So bring us your ideas,
1317.5	and I don't think that financing
1317.5	is going to be the problem.
1323.22	CA: All right, you heard it
1323.22	from the man himself.
1325.58	Jim, thanks so much.
1325.58	JYK: Thank you. Thank you.
1327.82	(Applause)
