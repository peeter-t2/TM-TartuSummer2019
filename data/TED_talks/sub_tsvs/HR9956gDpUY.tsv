12.693	It was just an ordinary Saturday.
15.14	My dad was outside mowing the lawn,
17.38	my mom was upstairs folding laundry,
19.66	my sister was in her room doing homework
21.82	and I was in the basement
21.82	playing video games.
24.9	And as I came upstairs
24.9	to get something to drink,
27.26	I looked out the window
28.5	and realized that there was something
28.5	that I was supposed to be doing,
31.82	and this is what I saw.
35.7	No, this wasn't
35.7	my family's dinner on fire.
38.82	This was my science project.
42.06	Flames were pouring out,
43.54	smoke was in the air
44.78	and it looked like our wooden deck
44.78	was about to catch fire.
48.02	I immediately started yelling.
49.86	My mom was freaking out,
51.38	my dad ran around to put out the fire
53.5	and of course my sister
53.5	started recording a Snapchat video.
57.66	(Laughter)
59.58	This was just the beginning
59.58	of my team's science project.
63.3	My team is composed of me
63.3	and three other students
65.98	who are here in the audience today.
68.1	We competed in FIRST LEGO League
70.14	which is an international
70.14	LEGO robotics competition for kids,
73.7	and in addition to a robotics game,
75.58	we also worked
75.58	on a separate science project,
77.98	and this was the project
77.98	that we were working on.
80.7	So the idea for this project all started
82.7	when a few months earlier,
83.98	a couple of my teammates
83.98	took a trip to Central America
86.82	and saw beaches littered with Styrofoam,
89.34	or expanded polystyrene foam.
91.86	And when they came back
91.86	and told us about it,
94.02	we really started thinking about the ways
94.02	in which we see Styrofoam every day.
97.74	Get a new flat-screen TV?
99.38	You end up with a block of Styrofoam
99.38	bigger than the TV itself.
102.9	Drink a cup of coffee?
104.38	Well, those Styrofoam coffee cups
104.38	are sure going to add up.
107.58	And where do all these items go
107.58	after their one-time use?
110.98	Since there aren't any good
110.98	existing solutions for used Styrofoam,
114.42	almost all of them
114.42	end up right in the landfill,
116.98	or the oceans and beaches,
118.34	taking over 500 years to degrade.
121.06	And in fact, every year, the US alone
123.3	produces over two billion
123.3	pounds of Styrofoam,
125.98	filling up a staggering
129.18	So why do we have these ghost
129.18	accumulations of Styrofoam waste?
132.86	Why can't we just recycle them
132.86	like many plastics?
136.22	Well, simply put, recycled
136.22	polystyrene is too expensive
139.66	and potentially contaminated,
141.26	so there is very little market demand
141.26	for Styrofoam that has to be recycled.
145.5	And as a result, Styrofoam
145.5	is considered a nonrenewable material,
149.06	because it is neither feasible
149.06	nor viable to recycle polystyrene.
153.42	And in fact, many cities across the US
156.02	have even passed ordinances
157.46	that simply ban the production
157.46	of many products containing polystyrene,
161.1	which includes disposable utensils,
163.18	packing peanuts, takeout containers
165.38	and even plastic beach toys,
167.54	all products that are very useful
167.54	in today's society.
170.54	And now France
170.54	has become the first country
172.74	to completely ban all plastic utensils,
175.02	cups and plates.
177.1	But what if we could keep using Styrofoam
179.54	and keep benefiting
179.54	from its cheap, lightweight, insulating
183.3	and excellent packing ability,
185.06	while not having to suffer
185.06	from the repercussions
187.42	of having to dispose of it?
189.14	What if we could turn it into
189.14	something else that's actually useful?
192.66	What if we could make
192.66	the impossible possible?
196.22	My team hypothesized that we could use
196.22	the carbon that's already in Styrofoam
200.82	to create activated carbon,
202.54	which is used in almost
202.54	every water filter today.
205.3	And activated carbon works
205.3	by using very small micropores
208.94	to filter out contaminants
208.94	from water or even air.
212.66	So we started out
212.66	by doing a variety of heating tests,
215.86	and unfortunately, we had many failures.
219.46	Literally, nothing worked.
222.02	Besides my dad's grill catching on fire,
224.3	most of our samples
224.3	vaporized into nothing,
226.98	or exploded inside expensive furnaces,
229.42	leaving a horribly sticky mess.
232.26	In fact, we were so saddened
232.26	by our failures that we almost gave up.
237.18	So why did we keep trying
238.54	when all the adults
238.54	said it was impossible?
240.94	Well, maybe it's because we're kids.
240.94	We don't know any better.
244.599	But the truth is, we kept trying
244.599	because we thought it was still possible.
248.1	We knew that if we were successful,
249.82	we would be helping the environment
249.82	and making the world a better place.
253.26	So we kept trying
254.94	and failing
256.7	and trying
258.38	and failing.
259.98	We were so ready to give up.
262.46	But then it happened.
264.06	With the right temperatures,
264.06	times and chemicals,
266.78	we finally got that successful test result
269.06	showing us that we had created
269.06	activated carbon from Styrofoam waste.
272.899	And at that moment,
272.899	the thing that had been impossible
275.5	all of a sudden wasn't.
277.3	It showed us that although we had
277.3	many failures at the beginning,
280.38	we were able to persevere through them
280.38	to get the test results that we wanted.
284.1	And moreover, not only were we able
284.1	to create activated carbon
287.06	for purifying water,
288.34	but we were also able
288.34	to reduce Styrofoam waste,
290.82	solving two global problems
290.82	with just one solution.
294.14	So from then on, we were inspired
294.14	to take our project further,
297.1	performing more tests
297.1	to make it more effective
299.34	and testing it in real world situations.
301.7	We then proceeded to receive funding
303.46	from the NSTA's eCYBERMISSION
303.46	STEM-in-Action program
306.46	sponsored by the US Army,
308.22	as well as FIRST Global Innovation Awards
310.62	sponsored by XPRIZE.
312.46	And we were also honored
313.74	with the Scientific American
313.74	Innovator Award
316.54	from Google Science Fair.
318.3	And using these funds, we plan
318.3	to file a full patent on our process
321.78	and to continue to work on our project.
324.26	So yes, although we started
324.26	with catching my dad's grill on fire
328.46	and failing so many times
328.46	that we almost quit,
330.98	it was well worth it
330.98	when we look back at it now.
333.54	We took a problem
333.54	that many people said was impossible
336.38	and we made it possible,
337.9	and we persevered when it looked
337.9	like nothing that we did would work.
341.18	We learned that you can't have success
343.3	without a little,
344.82	or a lot, of failure.
347.26	So in the future, don't be afraid
347.26	if your grill goes up in flames,
350.9	because you never know
350.9	when your idea might just catch fire.
355.62	Thank you.
356.86	(Applause)
