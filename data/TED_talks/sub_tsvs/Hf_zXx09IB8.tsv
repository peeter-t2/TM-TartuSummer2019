13.098	"""Look at me!"""
16.496	That phrase turned me
16.496	into an eye-contact coach.
22.615	I'm the mother of Ivan; he's 15 years old.
26.339	Ivan has autism,
28.307	he doesn't speak,
29.876	and he communicates through an iPad,
31.89	where his whole universe of words
31.89	exists in images.
37.767	He was diagnosed
37.767	when he was two and a half.
43.527	I still remember that day painfully.
49.299	My husband and I felt really lost;
53.309	we didn't know where to begin.
56.76	There was no internet,
59.209	you couldn't Google information,
62.525	so we made those first steps
65.439	out of sheer intuition.
69.669	Ivan would not maintain eye contact,
72.831	he had lost the words that he did know,
76.104	and he didn't respond to his name
76.104	or to anything we asked him,
80.889	as if words were noise.
85.287	The only way I could know
89.837	what was going on with him,
92.123	what he felt,
94.157	was looking him in the eye.
97.629	But that bridge was broken.
102.441	How could I teach him about life?
107.339	When I did things he liked,
107.339	he would look at me,
111.271	and we were connected.
113.705	So I dedicated myself
113.705	to working with him on those things,
117.297	so we would have more and more
117.297	eye-contact moments.
123.11	We would spend hours and hours playing tag
123.11	with his older sister, Alexia,
130.322	"and when we said: ""I caught you!"""
134.006	he would look around for us,
136.79	and at that moment,
136.79	I could feel he was alive.
144.908	We also hold a record for hours spent
144.908	in a swimming pool.
151.002	Ivan always had a passion for water.
155.654	I remember when he was two and a half,
159.581	on a rainy winter day,
162.905	I was taking him to an indoor pool,
165.405	because even on rainy days
165.405	we'd go swimming.
169.643	We were on the highway,
169.643	and I took the wrong exit.
174.115	He burst into tears and cried
174.115	inconsolably, nonstop,
178.081	until I turned back.
180.356	Only then did he calm down.
183.348	How was it possible
183.348	that a two and a half year old
187.068	didn't respond to his own name,
189.671	yet in the middle of the rain and fog,
189.671	where I couldn't see anything,
193.819	he knew the exact route?
200.886	That's when I realized that Ivan
200.886	had an exceptional visual memory,
205.362	and that that would be my way in.
209.647	So I started taking
209.647	pictures of everything,
212.688	and teaching him what life was like,
214.858	showing it to him, picture by picture.
219.578	Even now, it's the way Ivan communicates
224.3	what he wants,
226.131	what he needs
228.212	and also what he feels.
233.843	But it wasn't just
233.843	Ivan's eye contact that mattered.
238.752	Everyone else's did, too.
242.555	How could I make people see
242.555	not only his autism,
246.569	but see him the person
249.132	and everything he can give;
252.136	everything he can do;
255.207	the things he likes and doesn't like,
257.869	just like any one of us?
261.131	But for that, I also had
261.131	to give of myself.
265.614	I had to have the strength to let him go,
268.716	which was extremely difficult.
273.117	Ivan was 11 years old,
275.575	and he went for treatment
275.575	in a neighborhood near our house.
280.613	One afternoon,
280.613	while I was waiting for him,
284.683	I went into a greengrocer,
286.043	a typical neighborhood store
286.043	with a little bit of everything.
290.248	While doing the shopping,
291.824	I started talking to Jose, the owner.
296.762	I told him about Ivan,
298.877	that he had autism,
301.257	and that I wanted him to learn
301.257	to walk down the street by himself,
305.549	without anyone holding his hand.
308.695	So I decided to ask Jose
308.695	if Thursdays around 2pm,
313.329	Ivan could come and help him arrange
313.329	the water bottles on the shelves,
317.102	because he loved to organize things.
319.441	And as a reward, he could buy
319.441	some chocolate cookies,
323.231	which were his favorite.
327.663	"He said ""yes"" right away."
330.635	So that's how it went for a year:
333.901	Ivan would go to Jose's greengrocer,
337.132	help him arrange the shelves
337.132	of water bottles
340.6	with the labels perfectly
340.6	lined up on the same side,
345.887	and he would leave happy
345.887	with his chocolate cookies.
355.874	Jose is not an expert in autism.
361.111	There is no need to be an expert
365.032	nor do anything heroic to include someone.
371.904	We just need to be there --
374.335	(Applause)
382.762	(Applause ends)
385.557	Really, no heroic deed --
388.797	we simply need to be close.
393.768	And if we are afraid of something
396.331	or we don't understand something,
398.539	we need to ask.
401.002	Let's be curious
404.182	but never indifferent.
410.037	Let's have the courage
410.037	to look each other in the eye,
416.206	because by looking,
418.332	we can open a whole world to someone else.
422.962	(Applause)
425.384	(Cheers)
