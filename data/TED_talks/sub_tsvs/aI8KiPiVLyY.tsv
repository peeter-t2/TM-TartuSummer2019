13.11	How many people here have heard of PMS?
17.429	Everybody, right?
18.915	Everyone knows that women
18.915	go a little crazy
21.399	right before they get their period,
24.27	that the menstrual cycle throws them
24.27	onto an inevitable hormonal roller coaster
28.458	of irrationality and irritability.
31.151	There's a general assumption
32.939	that fluctuations in reproductive hormones
32.939	cause extreme emotions
37.858	and that the great majority of women
37.858	are affected by this.
41.391	Well, I am here to tell you
41.391	that scientific evidence says
44.15	neither of those assumptions is true.
46.569	I'm here to give you 
46.569	the good news about PMS.
50.572	But first, let's take a look
50.572	at how firmly the idea of PMS
54.242	is entrenched in American culture.
56.634	If you examine newspaper
56.634	or magazine articles,
60.21	you'll see how widely assumed it is
60.21	that everyone gets PMS.
64.552	In an article in the magazine Redbook
64.552	"titled ""You: PMS Free,"""
69.94	readers were informed that between 80 
69.94	to 90 percent of women suffer from PMS.
75.52	L.A. Muscle magazine warned its readers
78.251	that 40 to 50 percent of women
78.251	suffer from PMS,
81.525	and that it plays a major role
81.525	in women's mental and physical health,
86.169	and a couple of years ago,
86.169	even the Wall Street Journal
89.16	ran an article on calcium
89.16	as a treatment for PMS,
92.345	asking its female readers,
94.4	"""Do you turn into a witch every month?"""
96.989	From all these articles, you would think
96.989	there must be a mountain of research
100.866	verifying the widespread nature of PMS.
104.79	However, after five decades of research,
107.948	there's no strong consensus
107.948	on the definition, the cause,
112.019	the treatment, or even 
112.019	the existence of PMS.
116.16	As most commonly defined by psychologists,
119.313	PMS involves negative behavioral,
119.313	cognitive and physical symptoms
124.282	from the time of ovulation
124.282	to menstruation.
127.208	But here's where it gets tricky.
129.42	Over 150 different symptoms
129.42	have been used to diagnose PMS,
134.661	and here are just a few of those.
136.751	Now, I want to be clear here.
138.632	I'm not saying women don't get
138.632	some of these symptoms.
141.998	What I'm saying is that
141.998	getting some of these symptoms
144.622	doesn't amount to a mental disorder,
147.501	and when psychologists
147.501	come up with a disorder
150.822	that's so vaguely defined,
153.108	the label eventually becomes meaningless.
156.591	With a list of symptoms
156.591	this long and wide,
159.563	I could have PMS, you could have PMS,
162.326	the guy in the third row here
162.326	could have PMS,
164.88	my dog could have PMS.
164.88	(Laughter)
168.193	Some researchers said
168.193	you had to have five symptoms.
170.861	Some said three.
172.426	Other researchers said that symptoms
172.426	were only meaningful
175.282	if they were highly disturbing to you,
177.116	but others said minor symptoms
177.116	were just as important.
180.669	For many years, because
180.669	there was no standardization
183.571	in the definition of PMS,
185.66	when psychologists tried
185.66	to report prevalence rates,
188.725	their estimates ranged
188.725	from five percent of women
191.512	to 97 percent of women,
193.81	so at the same time almost no one
193.81	and almost everyone had PMS.
199.638	Overall, the weaknesses in the methods
199.638	of research on PMS have been considerable.
206.33	First, many studies asked women
206.33	to report their symptoms retrospectively,
211.967	looking to the past and relying on memory,
214.684	which is known to inflate reporting of PMS
217.865	compared to what's called
217.865	prospective reporting,
221.23	which involves keeping
221.23	a daily log of symptoms
223.426	for at least two months in a row.
225.864	Many studies also exclusively focused
225.864	on white, middle-class women,
230.833	which makes it problematic
230.833	to apply study findings to all women.
235.479	We know there's a strong
235.479	cultural component to the belief in PMS
239.517	because it's nearly unheard of
239.517	outside of Western nations.
243.139	Third, many studies failed
243.139	to use control groups.
247.4	If we want to understand
247.4	the specific characteristics
250.21	of women who have PMS,
251.73	we need to be able to compare them
251.73	to women who don't have PMS.
255.932	And finally, many different types
255.932	of questionnaires were used
259.16	to diagnose PMS, focusing
259.16	on different symptoms,
263.17	symptom duration and severity.
265.823	To do reliable research on any condition,
268.934	scientists must agree
268.934	on the specific characteristics
271.883	that make up that condition
273.636	so they're all talking
273.636	about the same thing,
275.749	and with PMS, this has not been the case.
279.185	However, in 1994,
281.461	the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
281.461	of Mental Disorders,
285.129	known as the DSM, thankfully --
287.428	it's also the manual
287.428	for mental health professionals --
291.306	they redefined PMS as PMDD,
295.23	Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder.
298.248	And dysphoria refers to
298.248	a feeling of agitation or unease.
304.192	And according to these new DSM guidelines,
307.652	in most menstrual cycles in the last year,
310.879	at least five of 11 possible symptoms
314.13	must appear in the week
314.13	before menstruation starts;
317.822	the symptoms must improve
317.822	once menstruation has begun;
321.189	and the symptoms must be absent
321.189	the week after menstruation has ended.
327.101	One of these symptoms must come
327.101	from this list of four:
330.429	marked mood swings, irritability,
330.429	anxiety, or depression.
335.677	The other symptoms could come
335.677	from the first slide
338.509	or from those on the second slide,
340.646	including symptoms like
340.646	feeling out of control
343.269	and changes in sleep or appetite.
346.938	The DSM also required now
346.938	that the symptoms
350.815	should be associated with
350.815	clinically significant distress --
354.995	there should be some kind
354.995	of disturbance in work
357.828	or school or social relationships --
360.753	and that symptoms and symptom severity
360.753	should now be documented
364.259	by keeping a daily log
364.259	for at least two cycles in a row.
368.276	And finally, the DSM required that
368.276	the emotional disturbance
372.131	should be more than simply an exacerbation
372.131	of an already existing disorder.
377.889	So scientifically speaking,
377.889	this is an improvement.
380.675	We now have a limited number of symptoms,
383.322	and a high impact on functioning
383.322	that's required,
386.898	and the reporting and timing of symptoms
386.898	have both become very specific.
392.354	Well, using this criteria
395.164	and looking at most recent studies,
397.31	we see that on average,
398.925	three to eight percent of women
398.925	suffer from PMDD.
404.89	Not all women, not most women,
407.47	not the majority of women,
407.47	not even a lot of women:
410.24	three to eight percent.
412.926	For everyone else, variables
412.926	like stressful events or happy occasions
417.883	or even day of the week
419.927	are more powerful predictors of mood
419.927	than time of the month,
424.012	and this is the information
424.012	the scientific community has had
427.452	since the 1990s.
428.982	In 2002, my colleagues and I
428.982	published an article
431.722	describing the PMS and PMDD research,
434.856	and several similar articles have appeared
434.856	in psychology journals.
439.129	The questions is, why hasn't this
439.129	information trickled down to the public?
443.54	Why do these myths persist?
447.116	Well, certainly the onslaught
447.116	of messages that women receive
450.413	from books, TV, movies, the Internet,
450.413	that everyone gets PMS
455.557	go a long way in convincing them
455.557	it must be true.
459.19	Research tells us that the more
459.19	a woman believes that everyone gets PMS,
464.36	the more likely she is
464.36	to erroneously report that she has it.
468.268	Let me tell you what I mean
468.268	"by ""erroneously."""
470.544	"You might ask her, ""Do you have PMS?"""
473.27	and she says yes,
474.613	but then, when you have her 
474.613	keep a daily log
477.031	of psychological symptoms for two months,
479.43	no correlation is found
479.43	between her symptoms
482.704	and time of the month.
485.016	Another reason for
485.016	the persistence of the PMS myth
489.385	has to do with the narrow boundaries
489.385	of the feminine role.
492.846	Feminist psychologists like Joan Chrisler
495.494	have suggested that
495.494	taking on the label of PMS
499.486	allows women to express emotions that
499.486	would otherwise be considered unladylike.
504.919	The near universal definition
504.919	of a good woman
508.31	is one who is happy, loving,
508.31	caring for others,
511.838	and taking great satisfaction
511.838	from that role.
514.694	Well, PMS has become a permission slip
514.694	to be angry, complain, be irritated,
519.846	without losing the title of good woman.
523.214	We know that the variables
523.214	in a woman's environment
527.254	are much more likely to cause her
527.254	to be angry than her hormones,
530.714	but when she attributes anger to hormones,
533.57	she's absolved
533.57	of responsibility or criticism.
536.337	"""Oh, that's not who she is."
536.337	"It's out of her control."""
539.79	And while this can be a useful tool,
539.79	it serves to invalidate women's emotions.
546.406	When people respond to a woman's anger
549.127	"with the thought, ""Oh,"
549.127	"it's just that time of the month,"""
552.122	her ability to be taken seriously
552.122	or effect change is severely limited.
557.48	So who else benefits from the myth of PMS?
561.467	Well, I can tell you that treating PMS
563.511	has become a profitable, 
563.511	thriving industry.
567.992	Amazon.com currently offers
567.992	over 1,900 books on PMS treatment.
574.772	A quick Google search
574.772	will bring up a cornucopia
577.233	of clinics, workshops and seminars.
580.971	Reputable Internet sources
580.971	of medical information
583.874	like WebMD or the Mayo Clinic
583.874	list PMS as a known disorder.
588.634	It's not a known disorder,
588.634	but they list it.
591.141	And they also list the medications that
591.141	physicians have prescribed to treat it,
595.112	like anti-depressants or hormones.
598.048	Interestingly, though, both websites
598.048	say that the success of medication
603.772	in treating PMS symptoms
603.772	vary from woman to woman.
607.859	Well, that doesn't make sense.
609.59	If you've got a distinct disorder
609.59	with a distinct cause,
612.224	which PMS is supposed to be,
614.174	then the treatment should bring
614.174	improvement for a great number of women.
617.982	This has not been the case
617.982	with these treatments,
620.536	and FDA regulations say that
620.536	for a drug to be deemed effective,
624.646	a large portion of the target population
626.713	should see clinically
626.713	significant improvement.
629.871	So we have not had that at all
629.871	with these so-called treatments.
633.887	However, the financial gain
633.887	of perpetuating the myth
638.2	that PMS is a common mental disorder
641.201	and is treatable is quite substantial.
645.27	When women are prescribed
645.27	drugs like anti-depressants or hormones,
648.724	medical protocol requires that they have
648.724	physician follow-up every three months.
653.833	That's a lot of doctor visits.
655.806	Pharmaceutical companies
655.806	reap untold profits
658.314	when women are convinced
658.314	they should take a prescribed medication
662.238	for all of their child-bearing lives.
665.14	Over-the-counter drugs like Midol
667.764	even claim to treat PMS symptoms
667.764	like tension and irritability,
672.176	even though they only contain
672.176	a diuretic, a pain reliever
676.169	and caffeine.
678.143	Now, far be it from me to argue
678.143	with the magical powers of caffeine,
681.579	but I don't think reducing tension
681.579	is one of them.
685.944	Since 2002, Midol has marketed
685.944	a Teen Midol to adolescents.
692.51	They are aiming at young girls early,
695.34	to convince them that everyone gets PMS
695.34	and that it will make you a monster,
699.585	but wait, there's something
699.585	you can do about it:
701.864	Take Midol and you will be
701.864	a human being again.
704.926	In 2013, Midol took in 48 million dollars
704.926	in sales revenue.
711.45	So while perpetuating the myth of PMS
711.45	has been lucrative for some,
716.1	it comes with some serious
716.1	adverse consequences for women.
720.32	First, it contributes
720.32	to the medicalization
722.874	of women's reproductive health.
725.544	The medical field has a long history
725.544	of conceptualizing
728.748	women's reproductive processes
728.748	as illnesses that require treatment,
734.158	and this has come at many costs,
734.158	including excessive Cesarean deliveries,
738.268	hysterectomies and prescribed
738.268	hormone treatments
740.978	that have harmed rather than enhanced
740.978	women's health.
745.675	Second, the PMS myth also contributes
745.675	to the stereotype of women
750.505	as irrational and overemotional.
753.871	When the menstrual cycle is described
753.871	as a hormonal roller coaster
757.61	that turns women into angry beasts,
760.43	it becomes easy to question 
760.43	the competence of all women.
764.775	Women have made tremendous strides
764.775	in the workforce,
767.594	but still there's a minuscule number
767.594	of women at the highest echelons
771.657	of fields like government or business,
774.397	and when we think about
774.397	who makes for a good CEO or senator,
779.343	someone who has qualities like 
779.343	rationality, steadiness, competence
784.462	come to mind,
785.971	and in our culture, that sounds more
785.971	like a man than a woman,
789.512	and the PMS myth contributes to that.
793.17	Psychologists know that
793.17	the moods of men and women
796.339	are more similar than different.
799.172	One study followed men and women
799.172	for four to six months
803.235	and found that the number
803.235	of mood swings they experienced
806.3	and the severity of those mood swings
806.3	were no different.
810.154	And finally, the PMS myth
810.154	keeps women from dealing
814.357	with the actual issues
814.357	causing them emotional upset.
818.374	Individual issues like
818.374	quality of relationship or work conditions
822.809	or societal issues like racism or sexism
822.809	or the daily grind of poverty
827.313	are all strongly related to daily mood.
830.657	Sweeping emotions under the rug of PMS
834.42	keeps women from understanding
834.42	the source of their negative emotions,
838.272	but it also takes away the opportunity
838.272	to take any action to change them.
843.64	So the good news about PMS
846.469	is that while some women get some symptoms
846.469	because of the menstrual cycle,
851.205	the great majority don't
851.205	get a mental disorder.
854.758	They go to work or school,
854.758	take care of their families,
857.985	and function at a normal level.
860.284	We know the emotions and moods
860.284	of men and women
863.511	are more similar than different,
865.462	so let's walk away from
865.462	the tired old PMS myth of women as witches
871.097	and embrace the reality of high emotional
871.097	and professional functioning
875.945	the great majority of women
875.945	live every day.
879.149	Thank you.
881.425	(Applause)
