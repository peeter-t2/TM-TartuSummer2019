13.44	I'm an underwater explorer,
17.48	more specifically a cave diver.
21.2	I wanted to be an astronaut
21.2	when I was a little kid,
23.84	but growing up in Canada as a young girl,
23.84	that wasn't really available to me.
29.68	But as it turns out,
29.68	we know a lot more about space
33.48	than we do about the underground waterways
33.48	coursing through our planet,
37.84	the very lifeblood of Mother Earth.
41.72	So I decided to do something
41.72	that was even more remarkable.
45.12	Instead of exploring outer space,
47.6	I wanted to explore
47.6	the wonders of inner space.
51.92	Now, a lot of people will tell you
53.6	that cave diving is perhaps
53.6	one of the most dangerous endeavors.
58.56	I mean, imagine yourself
58.56	here in this room,
61.48	if you were suddenly
61.48	plunged into blackness,
64.4	with your only job to find the exit,
66.84	sometimes swimming
66.84	through these large spaces,
69.2	and at other times
69.2	crawling beneath the seats,
72.56	following a thin guideline,
75.12	just waiting for the life support
75.12	to provide your very next breath.
79.88	Well, that's my workplace.
82.76	But what I want to teach you today
84.76	is that our world
84.76	is not one big solid rock.
89.16	It's a whole lot more like a sponge.
91.96	I can swim through a lot of the pores
91.96	in our earth's sponge,
95.84	but where I can't,
97.28	other life-forms and other materials
97.28	can make that journey without me.
102.32	And my voice is the one
102.32	that's going to teach you
105.36	about the inside of Mother Earth.
110.64	There was no guidebook available to me
113.64	when I decided to be the first person
113.64	to cave dive inside Antarctic icebergs.
119.72	In 2000, this was the largest
119.72	moving object on the planet.
124.16	It calved off the Ross Ice Shelf,
126.2	and we went down there
126.2	to explore ice edge ecology
129.16	and search for life-forms beneath the ice.
132.44	We use a technology called rebreathers.
135.64	It's an awful lot like the same technology
135.64	that is used for space walks.
139.88	This technology enables us to go deeper
142.36	than we could've imagined
142.36	even 10 years ago.
145.12	We use exotic gases,
147.2	and we can make missions
147.2	even up to 20 hours long underwater.
153.16	I work with biologists.
155.36	It turns out that caves
155.36	are repositories of amazing life-forms,
159.92	species that we never knew existed before.
163.76	Many of these life-forms
163.76	live in unusual ways.
167.08	They have no pigment
167.08	and no eyes in many cases,
171.04	and these animals
171.04	are also extremely long-lived.
175.56	In fact, animals swimming
175.56	in these caves today
179.04	are identical in the fossil record
181.56	that predates the extinction
181.56	of the dinosaurs.
184.92	So imagine that: these are
184.92	like little swimming dinosaurs.
188.68	What can they teach us
188.68	about evolution and survival?
193.12	When we look at an animal
193.12	like this remipede swimming in the jar,
197.16	he has giant fangs with venom.
200.04	He can actually attack something
204.32	If he were the size of a cat,
206.12	he'd be the most dangerous
206.12	thing on our planet.
209.92	And these animals live
209.92	in remarkably beautiful places,
213.2	and in some cases,
213.2	caves like this, that are very young,
217.84	yet the animals are ancient.
219.6	How did they get there?
221.88	I also work with physicists,
224.08	and they're interested oftentimes
224.08	in global climate change.
227.72	They can take rocks within the caves,
230.04	and they can slice them
230.04	and look at the layers within with rocks,
233.12	much like the rings of a tree,
235.08	and they can count back in history
237.12	and learn about the climate on our planet
237.12	at very different times.
240.84	The red that you see in this photograph
243.36	is actually dust from the Sahara Desert.
246.72	So it's been picked up by wind,
246.72	blown across the Atlantic Ocean.
250.84	It's rained down in this case
250.84	on the island of Abaco in the Bahamas.
255.24	It soaks in through the ground
256.88	and deposits itself
256.88	in the rocks within these caves.
260.88	And when we look back in the layers
260.88	of these rocks, we can find times
264.72	when the climate
264.72	was very, very dry on earth,
267.52	and we can go back
267.52	many hundreds of thousands of years.
272.56	Paleoclimatologists are also interested
274.84	in where the sea level stands were
274.84	at other times on earth.
278.16	Here in Bermuda, my team and I embarked
280.4	on the deepest manned dives
280.4	ever conducted in the region,
283.48	and we were looking for places
285.12	where the sea level
285.12	used to lap up against the shoreline,
288.68	many hundreds of feet
288.68	below current levels.
292.88	I also get to work with paleontologists
292.88	and archaeologists.
296.4	In places like Mexico,
296.4	in the Bahamas, and even in Cuba,
300.8	we're looking at cultural remains
300.8	and also human remains in caves,
305.52	and they tell us a lot
306.8	about some of the earliest
306.8	inhabitants of these regions.
310.76	But my very favorite project of all
310.76	was over 15 years ago,
314.28	when I was a part of the team
314.28	that made the very first
316.828	accurate, three-dimensional map
316.828	of a subterranean surface.
320.16	This device that I'm
320.16	driving through the cave
322.56	was actually creating
322.56	a three-dimensional model as we drove it.
327.04	We also used ultra low frequency radio
329.12	to broadcast back to the surface
329.12	our exact position within the cave.
334.32	So I swam under houses and businesses
334.32	and bowling alleys and golf courses,
339.16	and even under a Sonny's BBQ Restaurant,
343.08	Pretty remarkable, and what that taught me
345.2	was that everything we do
345.2	on the surface of our earth
348.12	will be returned to us to drink.
350.56	Our water planet is not just
350.56	rivers, lakes and oceans,
355.36	but it's this vast network of groundwater
355.36	that knits us all together.
360.16	It's a shared resource
360.16	from which we all drink.
364.04	And when we can understand
364.04	our human connections with our groundwater
368.36	and all of our water resources
368.36	on this planet,
371.04	then we'll be working on the problem
372.8	that's probably the most important
372.8	issue of this century.
377.04	So I never got to be that astronaut
377.04	that I always wanted to be,
380.48	but this mapping device,
380.48	designed by Dr. Bill Stone, will be.
384.12	It's actually morphed.
385.56	It's now a self-swimming autonomous robot,
388.88	artificially intelligent,
390.56	and its ultimate goal
390.56	is to go to Jupiter's moon Europa
394.16	and explore oceans beneath
394.16	the frozen surface of that body.
399.48	And that's pretty amazing.
402.16	(Applause)
