13.542	There are 39 million people in the world
16.386	who are blind.
17.876	Eighty percent of them
20.35	are living in low-income countries such as Kenya,
23.169	and the absolute majority
25.118	do not need to be blind.
26.625	They are blind from diseases
28.48	that are either completely curable or preventable.
32.256	Knowing this, with my young family,
34.768	we moved to Kenya.
36.162	We secured equipment,
37.969	funds, vehicles, we trained a team,
41.668	we set up a hundred clinics throughout
43.692	the Great Rift Valley
45.19	to try and understand a single question:
48.651	why are people going blind,
50.737	and what can we do?
53.656	The challenges were great.
56.57	When we got to where we were going,
58.401	we set up our high-tech equipment.
61.067	Power was rarely available.
63.246	We'd have to run our equipment
64.099	from petrol power generators.
66.999	And then something occurred to me:
68.946	There has to be an easier way,
71.441	because it's the patients who are the most in need
73.441	of access to eye care
74.999	who are the least likely to get it.
77.34	More people in Kenya,
78.446	and in sub-Saharan Africa,
80.358	have access to a mobile phone
82.149	than they do clean running water.
84.302	So we said, could we harness
86.021	the power of mobile technology
87.64	to deliver eye care in a new way?
89.791	And so we developed Peek,
91.576	a smartphone [system] that enables
94.114	community healthcare workers
95.626	and empowers them to deliver eye care everywhere.
99.456	We set about replacing
99.456	traditional hospital equipment,
102.126	which is bulky, expensive and fragile,
104.649	with smartphone apps and hardware
106.684	that make it possible to test anyone
108.821	in any language and of any age.
112.01	Here we have a demonstration
113.814	of a three-month-old having their vision
115.537	accurately tested using an app and an eye tracker.
123.65	We've got many trials going on
125.393	in the community and in schools,
127.593	and through the lessons that
127.593	we've learned in the field,
129.493	we've realized it's extremely important
131.196	to share the data in non-medical jargon
134.056	so that people understand
135.717	what we're examining and what that means to them.
138.34	So here, for example,
139.614	we use our sight sim application,
141.47	once your vision has been measured,
143.262	to show carers and teachers
145.972	what the visual world is like for that person,
148.486	so they can empathize with them and help them.
151.952	Once we've discovered somebody has low vision,
154.34	the next big challenge is to work out why,
156.911	and to be able to do that,
158.028	we need to have access to the inside of the eye.
160.529	Traditionally, this requires expensive equipment
163.115	to examine an area called the retina.
165.196	The retina is the single part of the eye that has
168.005	huge amounts of information about the body
170.101	and its health.
171.889	We've developed 3D-printed,
173.7	low-cost hardware
175.141	that comes in at less than five dollars to produce,
177.541	which can then be clipped onto a smartphone
180.484	and makes it possible to get views
181.926	of the back of the eye
183.147	of a very high quality.
184.903	And the beauty is, anybody can do it.
188.1	In our trials on over two and half thousand people,
190.979	the smartphone with the add-on clip
192.896	is comparable to a camera
194.577	that is hugely more expensive
196.472	and hugely more difficult to transport.
200.061	When we first moved to Kenya,
201.94	we went with 150,000 dollars of equipment,
204.593	a team of 15 people,
207.05	and that was what was
207.05	needed to deliver health care.
209.942	Now, all that's needed
212.307	is a single person
214.099	on a bike with a smartphone.
217.495	And it costs just 500 dollars.
221.349	The issue of power supply
223.219	is overcome by harnessing the power of solar.
225.78	Our healthcare workers travel
226.92	with a solar-powered rucksack
228.465	which keeps the phone charged and backed up.
230.926	Now we go to the patient
233.196	rather than waiting for the patient never to come.
235.907	We go to them in their homes
237.64	and we give them the most comprehensive,
239.437	high-tech, accurate examination,
241.377	which can be delivered by
241.377	anyone with minimal training.
245.481	We can link global experts
248.318	with people in the most rural,
250.06	difficult-to-reach places
251.25	that are beyond the end of the road,
252.839	effectively putting those experts in their homes,
255.353	allowing us to make diagnoses
257.331	and make plans for treatment.
260.399	Project managers, hospital directors,
263.126	are able to search on our interface
265.045	by any parameter they may be interested in.
267.047	Here in Nakuru, where I've been living,
269.07	we can search for people
270.406	by whatever condition.
271.85	Here are people who are blind
273.122	from a curable condition cataract.
275.652	Each red pin depicts somebody
277.681	who is blind from a disease that is curable
280.338	and treatable, and they're locatable.
282.584	We can use bulk text messaging services
284.468	to explain that we're coming to arrange a treatment.
287.622	What's more, we've learned that this is something
290.237	that we haven't built just for the community
292.275	but with the community.
293.86	Those blue pins that drop represent
296.112	elders, or local leaders,
298.213	that are connected to those people
299.452	who can ensure that we can find them
300.785	and arrange treatment.
302.886	So for patients like Mama Wangari,
305.888	who have been blind for over 10 years
307.484	and never seen her grandchildren,
309.113	for less than 40 dollars, we can restore her eyesight.
312.931	This is something that has to happen.
318.209	It's only in statistics
319.84	that people go blind by the millions.
322.563	The reality is everyone goes blind on their own.
326.431	But now, they might just be
328.408	a text message away from help.
330.547	(Applause)
337.295	And now because live demos are always a bad idea,
339.426	we're going to try a live demo.
341.224	(Laughter)
342.48	So here we have the Peek Vision app.
352.142	Okay, and what we're looking at here,
354.786	this is Sam's optic nerve,
356.281	which is a direct extension of her brain,
358.68	so I'm actually looking at her brain as we look there.
361.289	We can see all parts of the retina.
364.82	It makes it possible to pick up diseases
367.35	of the eye and of the body
369.517	that would not be possible without access to the eye,
372.046	and that clip-on device can be manufactured
373.981	for just a few dollars,
375.531	and people can be cured of blindness,
377.162	and I think it says a lot about us as a human race
380.385	if we've developed cures and we don't deliver them.
382.91	But now we can.
384.108	Thank you.
386.324	(Applause)
