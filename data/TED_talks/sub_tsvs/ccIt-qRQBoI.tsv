12.736	(Music) This is the human test,
15.77	a test to see if you are a human.
19.29	Please raise your hand if something applies to you.
23.489	Are we agreed? Yes?
27.33	Then let's begin.
29.486	Have you ever eaten a booger
31.395	long past your childhood?
33.937	(Laughter)
36.583	It's okay, it's safe here.
40.161	Have you ever made a small, weird sound
43.51	when you remembered something embarrassing?
49.15	Have you ever purposely lowercased
51.206	the first letter of a text
53.31	in order to come across as sad or disappointed?
57.32	(Laughter)
59.454	Okay.
62.168	Have you ever ended a text with a period
64.94	as a sign of aggression? Okay. Period.
71.65	Have you ever laughed or smiled
73.817	when someone said something shitty to you
76.489	and then spent the rest of the day
78.25	wondering why you reacted that way?
82.354	Yes.
84.532	Have you ever seemed to lose your airplane ticket
87.292	a thousand times as you walked
89.18	from the check-in to the gate?
92.21	Yes.
94.26	Have you ever put on a pair of pants
96.837	and then much later realized that there was
98.676	a loose sock smushed up against your thigh?
101.308	(Laughter)
103.28	Good.
105.812	Have you ever tried to guess
105.812	someone else's password
108.708	so many times that it locked their account?
112.985	Mmm.
114.674	Have you ever had a nagging feeling that one day
117.82	you will be discovered as a fraud?
122.24	Yes, it's safe here.
125.314	Have you ever hoped that there was some ability
127.91	you hadn't discovered yet
129.84	that you were just naturally great at?
133.76	Mmm.
135.36	Have you ever broken something in real life,
138.264	and then found yourself looking
139.976	"for an ""undo"" button in real life?"
145.05	Have you ever misplaced your TED badge
147.232	and then immediately started imagining
148.8	what a three-day Vancouver
148.8	vacation might look like?
155.523	Have you ever marveled
157.402	at how someone you thought was so ordinary
160.537	could suddenly become so beautiful?
164.946	Have you ever stared at your phone
167.01	smiling like an idiot while texting with someone?
172.46	Have you ever subsequently texted that person
174.82	"the phrase ""I'm staring at the phone"
177.612	"smiling like an idiot""?"
181.158	Have you ever been tempted to,
183.228	and then gave in to the temptation,
185.166	of looking through someone else's phone?
189.111	Have you ever had a conversation with yourself
191.391	and then suddenly realized
193.375	you're a real asshole to yourself?
196.568	(Laughter)
198.975	Has your phone ever run out of battery
201.879	in the middle of an argument,
204.265	and it sort of felt like the phone
205.863	was breaking up with both of you?
209.915	Have you ever thought
211.513	that working on an issue between you was futile
214.483	because it should just be easier than this,
217.204	or this is supposed to happen just naturally?
221.948	Have you ever realized that very little, in the long run,
225.356	just happens naturally?
227.812	Have you ever woken up blissfully
231.341	and suddenly been flooded
231.341	by the awful remembrance
234.148	that someone had left you?
237.212	Have you ever lost the ability to imagine a future
239.949	without a person
241.246	that no longer was in your life?
246.418	Have you ever looked back on that event
248.458	with the sad smile of autumn
250.366	and the realization that futures will happen
253.766	regardless?
256.901	Congratulations.
258.966	You have now completed the test.
261.341	You are all human.
264.54	(Applause)
