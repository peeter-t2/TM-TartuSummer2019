16.748	The most massive
20.317	tsunami perfect storm
25.252	is bearing down upon us.
29.131	This perfect storm
32.377	is mounting a grim reality, increasingly grim reality,
37.545	and we are facing that reality
42.495	with the full belief
43.876	that we can solve our problems with technology,
46.432	and that's very understandable.
48.728	Now, this perfect storm that we are facing
52.935	is the result of our rising population,
56.445	rising towards 10 billion people,
59.249	land that is turning to desert,
61.893	and, of course, climate change.
65.001	Now there's no question about it at all:
67.662	we will only solve the problem
69.473	of replacing fossil fuels with technology.
72.985	But fossil fuels, carbon -- coal and gas --
76.113	are by no means the only thing
78.234	that is causing climate change.
82.352	Desertification
84.235	is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert,
89.561	and this happens only when
91.862	we create too much bare ground.
93.871	There's no other cause.
95.877	And I intend to focus
97.895	on most of the world's land that is turning to desert.
102.801	But I have for you a very simple message
108.094	that offers more hope than you can imagine.
112.29	We have environments
114.358	where humidity is guaranteed throughout the year.
117.602	On those, it is almost impossible
120.106	to create vast areas of bare ground.
122.895	No matter what you do, nature covers it up so quickly.
126.517	And we have environments
128.264	where we have months of humidity
130.957	followed by months of dryness,
132.735	and that is where desertification is occurring.
136.213	Fortunately, with space technology now,
138.269	we can look at it from space,
139.946	and when we do, you can see the proportions fairly well.
144.21	Generally, what you see in green
145.833	is not desertifying,
147.688	and what you see in brown is,
149.994	and these are by far the greatest areas of the Earth.
154.366	About two thirds, I would guess, of the world is desertifying.
159.151	I took this picture in the Tihamah Desert
162.075	while 25 millimeters -- that's an inch of rain -- was falling.
165.779	Think of it in terms of drums of water,
168.491	each containing 200 liters.
171.163	Over 1,000 drums of water fell on every hectare
175.763	of that land that day.
178.637	The next day, the land looked like this.
181.021	Where had that water gone?
183.844	Some of it ran off as flooding,
186.241	but most of the water that soaked into the soil
189.188	simply evaporated out again,
191.469	exactly as it does in your garden
193.838	if you leave the soil uncovered.
196.853	Now, because the fate of water and carbon
200.319	are tied to soil organic matter,
203.877	when we damage soils, you give off carbon.
207.804	Carbon goes back to the atmosphere.
210.63	Now you're told over and over, repeatedly,
214.735	that desertification is only occurring
217.735	in arid and semi-arid areas of the world,
221.384	and that tall grasslands like this one
225.359	in high rainfall are of no consequence.
228.991	But if you do not look at grasslands but look down into them,
233.568	you find that most of the soil in that grassland
236.279	that you've just seen is bare and covered with a crust of algae,
240.57	leading to increased runoff and evaporation.
243.688	That is the cancer of desertification
247.674	that we do not recognize till its terminal form.
252.21	Now we know that desertification is caused by livestock,
257.522	mostly cattle, sheep and goats,
260.306	overgrazing the plants,
263.123	leaving the soil bare and giving off methane.
267.242	Almost everybody knows this,
269.482	from nobel laureates to golf caddies,
272.317	or was taught it, as I was.
274.948	Now, the environments like you see here,
278.418	dusty environments in Africa where I grew up,
281.282	and I loved wildlife,
284.202	and so I grew up hating livestock
287.594	because of the damage they were doing.
289.622	And then my university education as an ecologist
292.906	reinforced my beliefs.
295.994	Well, I have news for you.
301.27	We were once just as certain
304.554	that the world was flat.
306.834	We were wrong then, and we are wrong again.
310.779	And I want to invite you now
312.954	to come along on my journey of reeducation and discovery.
319.208	When I was a young man,
321.779	a young biologist in Africa,
324.674	I was involved in setting aside marvelous areas
329.091	as future national parks.
331.61	Now no sooner — this was in the 1950s —
335.037	and no sooner did we remove the hunting,
338.205	drum-beating people to protect the animals,
341.686	than the land began to deteriorate,
343.579	as you see in this park that we formed.
347.825	Now, no livestock were involved,
350.148	but suspecting that we had too many elephants now,
353.78	I did the research and I proved we had too many,
358.045	and I recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers
361.629	and bring them down to a level that the land could sustain.
365.681	Now, that was a terrible decision for me to have to make,
369.465	and it was political dynamite, frankly.
372.324	So our government formed a team of experts
375.449	to evaluate my research.
378.09	They did. They agreed with me,
380.497	and over the following years,
382.408	we shot 40,000 elephants to try to stop the damage.
388.299	And it got worse, not better.
392.039	Loving elephants as I do,
394.538	that was the saddest and greatest blunder of my life,
398.144	and I will carry that to my grave.
400.872	One good thing did come out of it.
403.344	It made me absolutely determined
406.72	to devote my life to finding solutions.
412.2	When I came to the United States, I got a shock,
416.285	to find national parks like this one
418.753	desertifying as badly as anything in Africa.
422.984	And there'd been no livestock on this land
424.988	for over 70 years.
427.712	And I found that American scientists
429.638	had no explanation for this
432.552	except that it is arid and natural.
435.512	So I then began looking
438.872	at all the research plots I could
442.123	over the whole of the Western United States
444.826	where cattle had been removed
447.027	to prove that it would stop desertification,
449.899	but I found the opposite,
451.732	as we see on this research station,
454.554	where this grassland that was green in 1961,
458.278	by 2002 had changed to that situation.
463.291	And the authors of the position paper on climate change
468.01	from which I obtained these pictures
470.563	"attribute this change to ""unknown processes."""
476.382	Clearly, we have never understood
480.376	what is causing desertification,
483.06	which has destroyed many civilizations
486.108	and now threatens us globally.
488.8	We have never understood it.
491.253	Take one square meter of soil
493.372	and make it bare like this is down here,
496.075	and I promise you, you will find it much colder at dawn
499.254	and much hotter at midday
502.058	than that same piece of ground if it's just covered with litter,
505.728	plant litter.
507.342	You have changed the microclimate.
510.379	Now, by the time you are doing that
512.478	and increasing greatly the percentage of bare ground
518.066	on more than half the world's land,
522.091	you are changing macroclimate.
525.321	But we have just simply not understood
527.91	why was it beginning to happen 10,000 years ago?
531.896	Why has it accelerated lately?
534.546	We had no understanding of that.
536.513	What we had failed to understand
539.938	was that these seasonal humidity environments of the world,
543.761	the soil and the vegetation
546.657	developed with very large numbers of grazing animals,
552.449	and that these grazing animals
555.073	developed with ferocious pack-hunting predators.
560.465	Now, the main defense against pack-hunting predators
564.357	is to get into herds,
566.698	and the larger the herd, the safer the individuals.
570.69	Now, large herds dung and urinate all over their own food,
575.521	and they have to keep moving,
578.521	and it was that movement
580.438	that prevented the overgrazing of plants,
583.242	while the periodic trampling
585.641	ensured good cover of the soil,
588.161	as we see where a herd has passed.
591.273	This picture is a typical seasonal grassland.
597.501	It has just come through four months of rain,
600.293	and it's now going into eight months of dry season.
603.975	And watch the change as it goes into this long dry season.
607.443	Now, all of that grass you see aboveground
610.519	has to decay biologically
614.267	before the next growing season, and if it doesn't,
617.791	the grassland and the soil begin to die.
621.984	Now, if it does not decay biologically,
625.179	it shifts to oxidation, which is a very slow process,
630.318	and this smothers and kills grasses,
633.273	leading to a shift to woody vegetation
636.382	and bare soil, releasing carbon.
639.802	To prevent that, we have traditionally used fire.
644.906	But fire also leaves the soil bare, releasing carbon,
650.755	and worse than that,
653.146	burning one hectare of grassland
655.826	gives off more, and more damaging, pollutants
658.986	than 6,000 cars.
661.9	And we are burning in Africa, every single year,
666.293	more than one billion hectares of grasslands,
670.932	and almost nobody is talking about it.
674.558	We justify the burning, as scientists,
678.897	because it does remove the dead material
681.81	and it allows the plants to grow.
685.113	Now, looking at this grassland of ours that has gone dry,
688.209	what could we do to keep that healthy?
690.905	And bear in mind, I'm talking of most of the world's land now.
693.929	Okay? We cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more
698.617	without causing desertification and climate change.
702.233	We cannot burn it without causing
705.37	desertification and climate change.
707.635	What are we going to do?
713.68	There is only one option,
716.07	I'll repeat to you, only one option
718.931	left to climatologists and scientists,
721.65	and that is to do the unthinkable,
724.578	and to use livestock,
727.314	bunched and moving,
730.269	as a proxy for former herds and predators,
733.658	and mimic nature.
735.402	There is no other alternative left to mankind.
739.906	So let's do that.
742.354	So on this bit of grassland, we'll do it, but just in the foreground.
745.724	We'll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature,
748.962	and we've done so, and look at that.
751.786	All of that grass is now covering the soil
755.146	as dung, urine and litter or mulch,
759.116	as every one of the gardeners amongst you would understand,
762.396	and that soil is ready to absorb and hold the rain,
766.757	to store carbon, and to break down methane.
771.764	And we did that,
773.994	without using fire to damage the soil,
776.764	and the plants are free to grow.
779.9	When I first realized
782.164	that we had no option as scientists
784.646	but to use much-vilified livestock
787.406	to address climate change and desertification,
792.653	I was faced with a real dilemma.
794.888	How were we to do it?
796.613	We'd had 10,000 years of extremely knowledgeable pastoralists
801.177	bunching and moving their animals,
803.125	but they had created the great manmade deserts of the world.
806.792	Then we'd had 100 years of modern rain science,
810.671	and that had accelerated desertification,
813.93	as we first discovered in Africa
816.103	and then confirmed in the United States,
818.767	and as you see in this picture
820.886	of land managed by the federal government.
824.247	Clearly more was needed
826.148	than bunching and moving the animals,
828.237	and humans, over thousands of years,
831.807	had never been able to deal with nature's complexity.
836.193	But we biologists and ecologists
838.577	had never tackled anything as complex as this.
841.546	So rather than reinvent the wheel,
844.185	I began studying other professions to see if anybody had.
848.321	And I found there were planning techniques
850.793	that I could take and adapt to our biological need,
854.565	and from those I developed what we call
857.262	holistic management and planned grazing,
860.572	a planning process,
862.371	and that does address all of nature's complexity
866.066	and our social, environmental, economic complexity.
871.315	Today, we have young women like this one
873.979	teaching villages in Africa
876.347	how to put their animals together into larger herds,
879.283	plan their grazing to mimic nature,
881.987	and where we have them hold their animals overnight --
886.028	we run them in a predator-friendly manner,
888.287	because we have a lot of lands, and so on --
890.609	and where they do this and hold them overnight
892.803	to prepare the crop fields,
894.608	we are getting very great increases in crop yield as well.
898.592	Let's look at some results.
900.209	This is land close to land that we manage in Zimbabwe.
904.433	It has just come through four months of very good rains
907.977	it got that year, and it's going into the long dry season.
911.487	But as you can see, all of that rain, almost of all it,
914.522	has evaporated from the soil surface.
917.629	Their river is dry despite the rain just having ended,
921.431	and we have 150,000 people
924.951	on almost permanent food aid.
928.701	Now let's go to our land nearby on the same day,
933.197	with the same rainfall, and look at that.
936.037	Our river is flowing and healthy and clean.
938.742	It's fine.
941.229	The production of grass, shrubs, trees, wildlife,
946.547	everything is now more productive,
949.403	and we have virtually no fear of dry years.
953.508	And we did that by increasing the cattle and goats
960.928	planning the grazing to mimic nature
964.058	and integrate them with all the elephants, buffalo,
966.479	giraffe and other animals that we have.
970.066	But before we began, our land looked like that.
975.788	This site was bare and eroding for over 30 years
981.205	regardless of what rain we got.
983.974	Okay? Watch the marked tree and see the change
987.592	as we use livestock to mimic nature.
991.245	This was another site
992.707	where it had been bare and eroding,
995.085	and at the base of the marked small tree,
997.789	we had lost over 30 centimeters of soil. Okay?
1002.077	And again, watch the change
1003.686	just using livestock to mimic nature.
1006.536	And there are fallen trees in there now,
1008.667	because the better land is now attracting elephants, etc.
1013.624	This land in Mexico was in terrible condition,
1017.28	and I've had to mark the hill
1019.234	because the change is so profound.
1023.421	(Applause)
1030.981	I began helping a family in the Karoo Desert in the 1970s
1035.918	turn the desert that you see on the right there
1038.886	back to grassland,
1040.82	and thankfully, now their grandchildren are on the land
1044.342	with hope for the future.
1046.185	And look at the amazing change in this one,
1048.982	where that gully has completely healed
1051.694	using nothing but livestock mimicking nature,
1056.273	and once more, we have the third generation of that family
1060.498	on that land with their flag still flying.
1063.778	The vast grasslands of Patagonia
1066.346	are turning to desert as you see here.
1068.422	The man in the middle is an Argentinian researcher,
1071.482	and he has documented the steady decline of that land
1075.126	over the years as they kept reducing sheep numbers.
1078.602	They put 25,000 sheep in one flock,
1083.45	really mimicking nature now with planned grazing,
1087.399	and they have documented a 50-percent increase
1091.742	in the production of the land in the first year.
1095.21	We now have in the violent Horn of Africa
1098.25	pastoralists planning their grazing to mimic nature
1101.706	and openly saying it is the only hope they have
1105.202	of saving their families and saving their culture.
1108.37	Ninety-five percent of that land
1110.446	can only feed people from animals.
1114.106	I remind you that I am talking about
1116.217	most of the world's land here that controls our fate,
1120.658	including the most violent region of the world,
1123.714	where only animals can feed people
1126.666	from about 95 percent of the land.
1129.97	What we are doing globally is causing climate change
1135.104	as much as, I believe, fossil fuels,
1138.4	and maybe more than fossil fuels.
1141.936	But worse than that, it is causing hunger, poverty,
1145.611	violence, social breakdown and war,
1148.608	and as I am talking to you,
1151.016	millions of men, women and children
1154.166	are suffering and dying.
1156.568	And if this continues,
1159.28	we are unlikely to be able to stop the climate changing,
1163.074	even after we have eliminated the use of fossil fuels.
1168.121	I believe I've shown you how we can work with nature
1172.357	at very low cost
1174.813	to reverse all this.
1177.309	We are already doing so
1179.741	on about 15 million hectares
1183.737	on five continents,
1186.369	and people who understand
1187.996	far more about carbon than I do
1190.286	calculate that, for illustrative purposes,
1193.344	if we do what I am showing you here,
1196.138	we can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere
1200.163	and safely store it in the grassland soils
1203.497	for thousands of years,
1205.123	and if we just do that on about half the world's grasslands
1210.119	that I've shown you,
1211.473	we can take us back to pre-industrial levels,
1215.173	while feeding people.
1216.814	I can think of almost nothing
1219.586	that offers more hope for our planet,
1223.111	for your children,
1225.359	and their children, and all of humanity.
1228.015	Thank you.
1231.32	(Applause)
1239.432	Thank you. (Applause)
1252.781	Thank you, Chris.
1254.501	Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have,
1257.847	and I'm sure everyone here has,
1259.944	A) a hundred questions, B) wants to hug you.
1263.672	I'm just going to ask you one quick question.
1265.431	When you first start this and you bring in a flock of animals,
1269.115	it's desert. What do they eat? How does that part work?
1272.491	How do you start?
1273.482	Allan Savory: Well, we have done this for a long time,
1275.121	and the only time we have ever had to provide any feed
1278.739	is during mine reclamation,
1280.508	where it's 100 percent bare.
1282.822	But many years ago, we took the worst land in Zimbabwe,
1287.178	where I offered a £5 note
1290.272	in a hundred-mile drive
1292.291	if somebody could find one grass
1294.411	in a hundred-mile drive,
1296.401	and on that, we trebled the stocking rate,
1299.187	the number of animals, in the first year with no feeding,
1302.963	just by the movement, mimicking nature,
1305.619	and using a sigmoid curve, that principle.
1310.394	It's a little bit technical to explain here, but just that.
1312.865	CA: Well, I would love to -- I mean, this such an interesting and important idea.
1316.577	The best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you
1318.569	and try and -- I want to get more on this
1321.201	that we could share along with the talk.AS: Wonderful.
1324.153	CA: That is an astonishing talk, truly an astonishing talk,
1327.689	and I think you heard that we all are cheering you on your way.
1330.465	Thank you so much.AS: Well, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Chris.
1333.457	(Applause)
