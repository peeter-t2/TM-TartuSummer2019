12.613	So why do we learn mathematics?
15.652	Essentially, for three reasons:
18.2	calculation,
19.828	application,
21.728	and last, and unfortunately least
24.415	in terms of the time we give it,
26.52	inspiration.
28.442	Mathematics is the science of patterns,
30.714	and we study it to learn how to think logically,
34.072	critically and creatively,
36.599	but too much of the mathematics
36.599	that we learn in school
39.525	is not effectively motivated,
41.844	and when our students ask,
43.269	"""Why are we learning this?"""
44.944	then they often hear that they'll need it
46.905	in an upcoming math class or on a future test.
50.17	But wouldn't it be great
51.972	if every once in a while we did mathematics
54.49	simply because it was fun or beautiful
57.439	or because it excited the mind?
59.529	Now, I know many people have not
61.251	had the opportunity to see how this can happen,
63.57	so let me give you a quick example
65.399	with my favorite collection of numbers,
67.74	the Fibonacci numbers. (Applause)
70.468	Yeah! I already have Fibonacci fans here.
72.52	That's great.
73.836	Now these numbers can be appreciated
75.952	in many different ways.
77.83	From the standpoint of calculation,
80.539	they're as easy to understand
82.216	as one plus one, which is two.
84.77	Then one plus two is three,
86.773	two plus three is five, three plus five is eight,
89.787	and so on.
91.312	Indeed, the person we call Fibonacci
93.489	was actually named Leonardo of Pisa,
96.669	"and these numbers appear in his book ""Liber Abaci,"""
99.722	which taught the Western world
101.372	the methods of arithmetic that we use today.
104.199	In terms of applications,
105.92	Fibonacci numbers appear in nature
108.103	surprisingly often.
109.96	The number of petals on a flower
111.7	is typically a Fibonacci number,
113.562	or the number of spirals on a sunflower
116.332	or a pineapple
117.743	tends to be a Fibonacci number as well.
120.137	In fact, there are many more
120.137	applications of Fibonacci numbers,
123.64	but what I find most inspirational about them
126.2	are the beautiful number patterns they display.
128.934	Let me show you one of my favorites.
131.128	Suppose you like to square numbers,
133.349	and frankly, who doesn't? (Laughter)
136.04	Let's look at the squares
138.28	of the first few Fibonacci numbers.
140.131	So one squared is one,
142.161	two squared is four, three squared is nine,
144.478	five squared is 25, and so on.
147.651	Now, it's no surprise
149.552	that when you add consecutive Fibonacci numbers,
152.38	you get the next Fibonacci number. Right?
154.412	That's how they're created.
155.807	But you wouldn't expect anything special
157.58	to happen when you add the squares together.
160.656	But check this out.
162.002	One plus one gives us two,
164.003	and one plus four gives us five.
166.765	And four plus nine is 13,
168.96	nine plus 25 is 34,
172.173	and yes, the pattern continues.
174.832	In fact, here's another one.
176.453	Suppose you wanted to look at
178.297	adding the squares of
178.297	the first few Fibonacci numbers.
180.795	Let's see what we get there.
182.403	So one plus one plus four is six.
184.542	Add nine to that, we get 15.
187.547	Add 25, we get 40.
189.76	Add 64, we get 104.
192.551	Now look at those numbers.
194.203	Those are not Fibonacci numbers,
196.587	but if you look at them closely,
198.466	you'll see the Fibonacci numbers
200.349	buried inside of them.
202.527	Do you see it? I'll show it to you.
204.597	Six is two times three, 15 is three times five,
210.389	two, three, five, eight, who do we appreciate?
213.317	(Laughter)
214.504	Fibonacci! Of course.
216.659	Now, as much fun as it is to discover these patterns,
220.442	it's even more satisfying to understand
222.924	why they are true.
224.882	Let's look at that last equation.
226.771	Why should the squares of one, one,
226.771	two, three, five and eight
230.639	add up to eight times 13?
233.184	I'll show you by drawing a simple picture.
236.145	We'll start with a one-by-one square
238.832	and next to that put another one-by-one square.
242.997	Together, they form a one-by-two rectangle.
246.405	Beneath that, I'll put a two-by-two square,
248.954	and next to that, a three-by-three square,
251.749	beneath that, a five-by-five square,
253.75	and then an eight-by-eight square,
255.662	creating one giant rectangle, right?
258.234	Now let me ask you a simple question:
260.15	what is the area of the rectangle?
263.806	Well, on the one hand,
265.777	it's the sum of the areas
268.307	of the squares inside it, right?
270.173	Just as we created it.
271.532	It's one squared plus one squared
273.704	plus two squared plus three squared
275.937	plus five squared plus eight squared. Right?
278.536	That's the area.
280.393	On the other hand, because it's a rectangle,
282.719	the area is equal to its height times its base,
286.367	and the height is clearly eight,
288.414	and the base is five plus eight,
291.317	which is the next Fibonacci number, 13. Right?
295.255	So the area is also eight times 13.
298.618	Since we've correctly calculated the area
300.88	two different ways,
302.567	they have to be the same number,
304.739	and that's why the squares of one,
304.739	one, two, three, five and eight
308.13	add up to eight times 13.
310.421	Now, if we continue this process,
312.795	we'll generate rectangles of the form 13 by 21,
319.167	Now check this out.
320.576	If you divide 13 by eight,
322.769	you get 1.625.
324.812	And if you divide the larger number
324.812	by the smaller number,
328.239	then these ratios get closer and closer
331.112	to about 1.618,
333.765	known to many people as the Golden Ratio,
337.066	a number which has fascinated mathematicians,
339.662	scientists and artists for centuries.
342.908	Now, I show all this to you because,
345.139	like so much of mathematics,
347.164	there's a beautiful side to it
349.131	that I fear does not get enough attention
351.146	in our schools.
352.713	We spend lots of time learning about calculation,
355.546	but let's not forget about application,
358.302	including, perhaps, the most
358.302	important application of all,
361.756	learning how to think.
363.832	If I could summarize this in one sentence,
365.789	it would be this:
367.25	Mathematics is not just solving for x,
370.61	it's also figuring out why.
373.535	Thank you very much.
375.35	(Applause)
