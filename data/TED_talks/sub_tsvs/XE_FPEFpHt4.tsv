16.087	I've always written primarily about architecture,
18.118	about buildings, and writing about architecture
20.643	is based on certain assumptions.
23.384	An architect designs a building, and it becomes a place,
25.842	or many architects design many buildings, and it becomes
28.322	a city, and regardless of this complicated mix of forces
31.596	of politics and culture and economics that shapes
33.993	these places, at the end of the day, you can go
36.996	and you can visit them. You can walk around them.
39.652	You can smell them. You can get a feel for them.
41.325	You can experience their sense of place.
44.818	But what was striking to me over the last several years
47.167	was that less and less was I going out into the world,
50.542	and more and more, I was sitting in front of my computer screen.
53.771	And especially since about 2007, when I got an iPhone,
58.091	I was not only sitting in front of my screen all day,
59.967	but I was also getting up at the end of the day
62.064	and looking at this little screen that I carried in my pocket.
65.364	And what was surprising to me was how quickly
68.223	my relationship to the physical world had changed.
71.16	In this very short period of time, you know, whether you
72.935	call it the last 15 years or so of being online, or the last,
76.391	you know, four or five years of being online all the time,
79.35	our relationship to our surroundings had changed in that
82.524	our attention is constantly divided. You know,
84.323	we're both looking inside the screens and we're looking
86.887	out in the world around us.
88.719	And what was even more striking to me, and what I really
91.246	got hung up on, was that the world inside the screen
94.248	seemed to have no physical reality of its own.
98.037	If you went and looked for images of the Internet,
100.805	this was all that you found, this famous image by Opte
103.923	of the Internet as the kind of Milky Way, this infinite expanse
107.053	where we don't seem to be anywhere on it.
109.149	We can never seem to grasp it in its totality.
111.573	It's always reminded me of the Apollo image of the Earth,
115.19	the blue marble picture, and it's similarly meant to suggest,
117.92	I think, that we can't really understand it as a whole.
120.617	We're always sort of small in the face of its expanse.
124.302	So if there was this world and this screen, and if there was
127.667	the physical world around me, I couldn't ever get them
130.524	together in the same place.
133.505	And then this happened.
136.712	My Internet broke one day, as it occasionally does,
139.31	and the cable guy came to fix it, and he started with
142.044	the dusty clump of cables behind the couch,
144.171	and he followed it to the front of my building and into the basement and out to the back yard,
147.381	and there was this big jumble of cables against the wall.
150.257	And then he saw a squirrel running along the wire,
152.811	"and he said, ""There's your problem."
155.602	"A squirrel is chewing on your Internet."" (Laughter)"
160.023	And this seemed astounding. The Internet is
163.15	a transcendent idea. It's a set of protocols that has changed
166.524	everything from shopping to dating to revolutions.
169.979	It was unequivocally not something
172.608	a squirrel could chew on. (Laughter)
175.919	But that in fact seemed to be the case.
177.797	A squirrel had in fact chewed on my Internet. (Laughter)
180.999	And then I got this image in my head of what would happen
183.186	if you yanked the wire from the wall and if you started
185.366	to follow it. Where would it go?
186.97	Was the Internet actually a place that you could visit?
190.478	Could I go there? Who would I meet?
191.827	You know, was there something actually out there?
195.203	And the answer, by all accounts, was no.
198.24	This was the Internet, this black box with a red light on it,
201.02	"as represented in the sitcom ""The IT Crowd."""
204.45	Normally it lives on the top of Big Ben,
208.009	because that's where you get the best reception,
211.091	but they had negotiated that their colleague could borrow it
214.396	for the afternoon to use in an office presentation.
217.568	The elders of the Internet were willing to part with it
219.942	for a short while, and she looks at it and she says,
222.808	"""This is the Internet? The whole Internet? Is it heavy?"""
226.198	"They say, ""Of course not, the Internet doesn't weigh anything."""
230.158	And I was embarrassed. I was looking for this thing
232.475	that only fools seem to look for.
234.771	The Internet was that amorphous blob, or it was a silly
237.606	black box with a blinking red light on it.
239.852	It wasn't a real world out there.
242.18	But, in fact, it is. There is a real world of the Internet out there,
245.492	and that's what I spent about two years visiting,
247.258	these places of the Internet. I was in large data centers
250.803	that use as much power as the cities in which they sit,
253.448	and I visited places like this, 60 Hudson Street in New York,
256.637	which is one of the buildings in the world,
258.345	one of a very short list of buildings, about a dozen buildings,
261.243	where more networks of the Internet connect to each other
263.887	than anywhere else.
265.245	And that connection is an unequivocally physical process.
267.862	It's about the router of one network, a Facebook or
270.347	a Google or a B.T. or a Comcast or a Time Warner, whatever it is,
273.289	connecting with usually a yellow fiber optic cable up into
275.72	the ceiling and down into the router of another network,
278.414	and that's unequivocally physical, and it's surprisingly intimate.
282.791	A building like 60 Hudson, and a dozen or so others,
286.084	has 10 times more networks connecting within it
288.41	than the next tier of buildings.
290.258	There's a very short list of these places.
292.326	And 60 Hudson in particular is interesting because it's home
295.234	to about a half a dozen very important networks,
297.823	which are the networks which serve the undersea cables
300.121	that travel underneath the ocean
302.469	that connect Europe and America and connect all of us.
304.722	And it's those cables in particular that I want to focus on.
308.309	If the Internet is a global phenomenon, if we live
312.185	in a global village, it's because there are cables underneath
314.625	the ocean, cables like this.
316.73	And in this dimension, they are incredibly small.
319.616	You can you hold them in your hand. They're like a garden hose.
322.558	But in the other dimension they are incredibly expansive,
326.621	as expansive as you can imagine.
328.261	They stretch across the ocean. They're three or five
330.816	or eight thousand miles in length, and
333.427	if the material science and the computational technology
336.036	is incredibly complicated, the basic physical process
339.569	is shockingly simple. Light goes in on one end of the ocean
343.349	and comes out on the other, and it usually comes
346.634	from a building called a landing station that's often
349.267	tucked away inconspicuously in a little seaside neighborhood,
352.214	and there are amplifiers that sit on the ocean floor
354.948	that look kind of like bluefin tuna, and every 50 miles
357.468	they amplify the signal, and since the rate of transmission
361.125	is incredibly fast, the basic unit is a 10-gigabit-per-second
364.331	wavelength of light, maybe a thousand times your own
366.829	connection, or capable of carrying 10,000 video streams,
370.013	but not only that, but you'll put not just one wavelength of light
373.291	through one of the fibers, but you'll put maybe
379.267	through a single fiber, and then you'll have maybe
382.135	eight fibers in a cable, four going in each direction.
384.737	And they're tiny. They're the thickness of a hair.
388.227	And then they connect to the continent somewhere.
390.056	They connect in a manhole like this. Literally,
392.394	this is where the 5,000-mile cable plugs in.
395.483	This is in Halifax, a cable that stretches from Halifax to Ireland.
399.973	And the landscape is changing. Three years ago,
402.954	when I started thinking about this, there was one cable
404.85	down the Western coast of Africa, represented
408.017	in this map by Steve Song as that thin black line.
410.891	Now there are six cables and more coming, three down each coast.
415.736	Because once a country gets plugged in by one cable,
418.367	they realize that it's not enough. If they're going to build
420.167	an industry around it, they need to know that their connection
422.983	isn't tenuous but permanent, because if a cable breaks,
425.693	you have to send a ship out into the water, throw
427.76	a grappling hook over the side, pick it up, find the other end,
430.675	and then fuse the two ends back together and then dump it over.
433.718	It's an intensely, intensely physical process.
438.258	So this is my friend Simon Cooper, who until very recently
442.556	worked for Tata Communications, the communications wing
445.228	of Tata, the big Indian industrial conglomerate.
448.226	And I've never met him. We've only communicated
451.208	via this telepresence system, which always makes me
454.665	think of him as the man inside the Internet. (Laughter)
458.561	And he is English. The undersea cable industry
461.758	is dominated by Englishmen, and they all seem to be 42.
465.403	(Laughter) Because they all started at the same time
468.578	with the boom about 20 years ago.
471.078	And Tata had gotten its start as a communications business
474.338	when they bought two cables, one across the Atlantic
476.803	and one across the Pacific, and proceeded to add pieces
479.963	onto them, until they had built a belt around the world,
483.507	which means they will send your bits to the East or the West.
485.604	They have -- this is literally a beam of light around the world,
487.827	and if a cable breaks in the Pacific, it'll send it around
490.038	the other direction. And then having done that,
493.223	they started to look for places to wire next.
497.167	They looked for the unwired places, and that's meant
499.657	North and South, primarily these cables to Africa.
502.451	But what amazes me is Simon's incredible geographic imagination.
506.222	He thinks about the world with this incredible expansiveness.
509.181	And I was particularly interested because I wanted to see
512.494	one of these cables being built. See, you know, all the time
515.346	online we experience these fleeting moments of connection,
517.666	these sort of brief adjacencies, a tweet or a Facebook post
520.96	or an email, and it seemed like there was a physical corollary to that.
524.8	It seemed like there was a moment when the continent
526.876	was being plugged in, and I wanted to see that.
529.223	And Simon was working on a new cable,
531.508	WACS, the West Africa Cable System, that stretched
534.019	from Lisbon down the west coast of Africa,
536.14	to Cote d'Ivoire, to Ghana, to Nigeria, to Cameroon.
539.009	And he said there was coming soon, depending
541.342	on the weather, but he'd let me know when,
543.536	and so with about four days notice, he said to go
546.737	to this beach south of Lisbon, and a little after 9,
549.568	this guy will walk out of the water. (Laughter)
553.264	And he'll be carrying a green nylon line, a lightweight line,
557.584	called a messenger line, and that was the first link
560.297	between sea and land, this link that would then be
562.85	leveraged into this 9,000-mile path of light.
566.713	Then a bulldozer began to pull the cable in from this
569.303	specialized cable landing ship, and it was floated
572.66	on these buoys until it was in the right place.
575.408	Then you can see the English engineers looking on.
578.15	And then, once it was in the right place, he got back
580.963	in the water holding a big knife, and he cut each buoy off,
584.322	and the buoy popped up into the air, and the cable
586.621	dropped to the sea floor, and he did that all the way out
588.526	to the ship, and when he got there,
590.399	they gave him a glass of juice and a cookie,
592.812	and then he jumped back in, and he swam back to shore,
595.231	and then he lit a cigarette. (Laughter)
602.391	And then once that cable was on shore,
605.103	they began to prepare to connect it to the other side,
608.607	for the cable that had been brought down from the landing station.
611.564	And first they got it with a hacksaw, and then they start
614.422	sort of shaving away at this plastic interior with a --
617.358	sort of working like chefs, and then finally they're working
619.42	like jewelers to get these hair-thin fibers to line up
622.128	with the cable that had come down,
623.805	and with this hole-punch machine they fuse it together.
626.796	And when you see these guys going at this cable with a hacksaw,
630.127	you stop thinking about the Internet as a cloud.
632.77	It starts to seem like an incredibly physical thing.
636.707	And what surprised me as well was that as much as this
639.215	is based on the most sophisticated technology, as much
642.062	as this is an incredibly new thing, the physical process
644.967	itself has been around for a long time, and the culture is the same.
648.734	You see the local laborers. You see the English engineer
650.723	giving directions in the background. And more importantly,
653.898	the places are the same. These cables still connect
656.541	these classic port cities, places like Lisbon, Mombasa,
659.591	Mumbai, Singapore, New York.
662.75	And then the process on shore takes around three or four days,
666.836	and then, when it's done, they put the manhole cover
671.027	back on top, and they push the sand over that,
673.998	and we all forget about it.
677.08	And it seems to me that we talk a lot about the cloud,
679.331	but every time we put something on the cloud,
681.241	we give up some responsibility for it.
683.443	We are less connected to it. We let other people worry about it.
687.307	And that doesn't seem right.
688.59	There's a great Neal Stephenson line where he says
690.932	that wired people should know something about wires.
695.329	And we should know, I think, we should know
697.599	where our Internet comes from, and we should know
700.352	what it is that physically, physically connects us all.
705.174	Thank you. (Applause)
707.513	(Applause)
709.91	Thanks. (Applause)
