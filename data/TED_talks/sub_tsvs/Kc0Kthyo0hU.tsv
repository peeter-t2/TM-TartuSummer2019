12.804	What is it that French people
12.804	do better than all the others?
18.454	If you would take polls,
20.404	the top three answers might be:
22.235	love, wine and whining.
26.298	(Laughter)
27.623	Maybe.
29.53	But let me suggest a fourth one:
31.892	mathematics.
33.76	Did you know that Paris
33.76	has more mathematicians
36.637	than any other city in the world?
38.801	And more streets
38.801	with mathematicians' names, too.
42.215	And if you look at the statistics
42.215	of the Fields Medal,
45.688	often called the Nobel Prize
45.688	for mathematics,
48.205	and always awarded to mathematicians
48.205	below the age of 40,
52.161	you will find that France has more
52.161	Fields medalists per inhabitant
56.072	than any other country.
58.286	What is it that we find so sexy in math?
62.153	After all, it seems to be
62.153	dull and abstract,
65.381	just numbers and computations
65.381	and rules to apply.
70.518	Mathematics may be abstract,
72.654	but it's not dull
73.829	and it's not about computing.
76.178	It is about reasoning
77.949	and proving our core activity.
80.513	It is about imagination,
82.059	the talent which we most praise.
84.102	It is about finding the truth.
87.613	There's nothing like the feeling
87.613	which invades you
90.374	when after months of hard thinking,
92.569	you finally understand the right
92.569	reasoning to solve your problem.
97.042	The great mathematician
97.042	André Weil likened this --
100.642	no kidding --
101.817	to sexual pleasure.
104.197	But noted that this feeling
104.197	can last for hours, or even days.
110.804	The reward may be big.
113.325	Hidden mathematical truths
113.325	permeate our whole physical world.
117.68	They are inaccessible to our senses
120.374	but can be seen
120.374	through mathematical lenses.
124.092	Close your eyes for moment
125.708	and think of what is occurring
125.708	right now around you.
130.337	Invisible particles from the air
130.337	around are bumping on you
133.854	by the billions and billions
133.854	at each second,
136.611	all in complete chaos.
139.049	And still,
140.224	their statistics can be accurately
140.224	predicted by mathematical physics.
145.715	And open your eyes now
148.531	to the statistics of the velocities
148.531	of these particles.
152.51	The famous bell-shaped Gauss Curve,
155.774	or the Law of Errors --
157.979	of deviations with respect
157.979	to the mean behavior.
161.55	This curve tells about the statistics
161.55	of velocities of particles
165.876	in the same way as a demographic curve
168.439	would tell about the statistics
168.439	of ages of individuals.
172.884	It's one of the most
172.884	important curves ever.
176.137	It keeps on occurring again and again,
179.347	from many theories and many experiments,
181.774	as a great example of the universality
185.079	which is so dear to us mathematicians.
189.694	Of this curve,
190.945	the famous scientist Francis Galton said,
194.018	"""It would have been deified by the Greeks"
194.018	if they had known it.
199.064	"It is the supreme law of unreason."""
203.818	And there's no better way to materialize
203.818	that supreme goddess than Galton's Board.
211.774	Inside this board are narrow tunnels
214.995	through which tiny balls
214.995	will fall down randomly,
220.295	going right or left, or left, etc.
226.139	All in complete randomness and chaos.
230.085	Let's see what happens when we look
230.085	at all these random trajectories together.
236.189	(Board shaking)
241.648	This is a bit of a sport,
244.516	because we need to resolve
244.516	some traffic jams in there.
251.715	Aha.
253.313	We think that randomness
253.313	is going to play me a trick on stage.
259.609	There it is.
262.382	Our supreme goddess of unreason.
264.989	the Gauss Curve,
266.532	trapped here inside this transparent box
266.532	"as Dream in ""The Sandman"" comics."
274.623	For you I have shown it,
277.345	but to my students I explain why
277.345	it could not be any other curve.
283.128	And this is touching
283.128	the mystery of that goddess,
286.022	replacing a beautiful coincidence
286.022	by a beautiful explanation.
291.027	All of science is like this.
294.213	And beautiful mathematical explanations
294.213	are not only for our pleasure.
299.585	They also change our vision of the world.
303.04	For instance,
304.301	Einstein,
305.476	Perrin,
306.651	Smoluchowski,
307.826	they used the mathematical analysis
307.826	of random trajectories
311.409	and the Gauss Curve
313.47	to explain and prove that our
313.47	world is made of atoms.
319.524	It was not the first time
321.35	that mathematics was revolutionizing
321.35	our view of the world.
325.555	More than 2,000 years ago,
327.791	at the time of the ancient Greeks,
331.502	it already occurred.
333.827	In those days,
335.137	only a small fraction of the world
335.137	had been explored,
338.444	and the Earth might have seemed infinite.
342.034	But clever Eratosthenes,
343.825	using mathematics,
345.266	was able to measure the Earth
345.266	with an amazing accuracy of two percent.
351.969	Here's another example.
354.238	In 1673, Jean Richer noticed
358.067	that a pendulum swings slightly
358.067	slower in Cayenne than in Paris.
366.35	From this observation alone,
366.35	and clever mathematics,
370.774	Newton rightly deduced
373.104	that the Earth is a wee bit
373.104	flattened at the poles,
378.669	like 0.3 percent --
380.843	so tiny that you wouldn't even
380.843	notice it on the real view of the Earth.
386.276	These stories show that mathematics
390.228	is able to make us go out of our intuition
395.512	measure the Earth which seems infinite,
399.021	see atoms which are invisible
401.339	or detect an imperceptible
401.339	variation of shape.
404.744	And if there is just one thing that you
404.744	should take home from this talk,
408.615	it is this:
409.833	mathematics allows us
409.833	to go beyond the intuition
414.235	and explore territories
414.235	which do not fit within our grasp.
419.609	Here's a modern example
419.609	you will all relate to:
423.362	searching the Internet.
426.037	The World Wide Web,
427.403	more than one billion web pages --
429.231	do you want to go through them all?
431.66	Computing power helps,
433.486	but it would be useless without
433.486	the mathematical modeling
436.696	to find the information
436.696	hidden in the data.
440.491	Let's work out a baby problem.
443.872	Imagine that you're a detective
443.872	working on a crime case,
447.703	and there are many people
447.703	who have their version of the facts.
452.032	Who do you want to interview first?
454.681	Sensible answer:
456.62	prime witnesses.
458.878	You see,
460.136	suppose that there is person number seven,
464.38	tells you a story,
465.555	but when you ask where he got if from,
467.593	he points to person
467.593	number three as a source.
470.653	And maybe person number three, in turn,
472.745	points at person number one
472.745	as the primary source.
476.465	Now number one is a prime witness,
478.15	so I definitely want
478.15	to interview him -- priority.
482.148	And from the graph
483.323	we also see that person
483.323	number four is a prime witness.
486.575	And maybe I even want
486.575	to interview him first,
489.042	because there are more
489.042	people who refer to him.
492.354	OK, that was easy,
495.042	but now what about if you have
495.042	a big bunch of people who will testify?
500.864	And this graph,
502.24	I may think of it as all people
502.24	who testify in a complicated crime case,
507.883	but it may just as well be web pages
507.883	pointing to each other,
511.929	referring to each other for contents.
514.878	Which ones are the most authoritative?
517.587	Not so clear.
520.091	Enter PageRank,
522.015	one of the early cornerstones of Google.
525.337	This algorithm uses the laws
525.337	of mathematical randomness
529.603	to determine automatically
529.603	the most relevant web pages,
533.484	in the same way as we used randomness
533.484	in the Galton Board experiment.
539.341	So let's send into this graph
541.706	a bunch of tiny, digital marbles
544.58	and let them go randomly
544.58	through the graph.
548.353	Each time they arrive at some site,
550.044	they will go out through some link
550.044	chosen at random to the next one.
554.234	And again, and again, and again.
556.358	And with small, growing piles,
558.01	we'll keep the record of how many
558.01	times each site has been visited
561.787	by these digital marbles.
564.243	Here we go.
565.418	Randomness, randomness.
567.811	And from time to time,
569.283	also let's make jumps completely
569.283	randomly to increase the fun.
574.471	And look at this:
576.358	from the chaos will emerge the solution.
579.483	The highest piles
579.483	correspond to those sites
581.992	which somehow are better
581.992	connected than the others,
585.527	more pointed at than the others.
587.824	And here we see clearly
589.57	which are the web pages
589.57	we want to first try.
593.507	Once again,
594.682	the solution emerges from the randomness.
597.775	Of course, since that time,
600.05	Google has come up with much more
600.05	sophisticated algorithms,
603.781	but already this was beautiful.
606.981	And still,
608.481	just one problem in a million.
610.734	With the advent of digital area,
613.028	more and more problems lend
613.028	themselves to mathematical analysis,
618.068	making the job of mathematician
618.068	a more and more useful one,
623.166	to the extent that a few years ago,
625.912	it was ranked number one
625.912	among hundreds of jobs
629.715	in a study about the best and worst jobs
633.707	published by the Wall Street
633.707	Journal in 2009.
637.445	Mathematician --
639.321	best job in the world.
641.646	That's because of the applications:
644.738	communication theory,
646.901	information theory,
648.745	game theory,
650.029	compressed sensing,
651.499	machine learning,
653.085	graph analysis,
654.676	harmonic analysis.
656.442	And why not stochastic processes,
659.106	linear programming,
660.76	or fluid simulation?
663.292	Each of these fields have
663.292	monster industrial applications.
667.211	And through them,
668.386	there is big money in mathematics.
671.4	And let me concede
673.464	that when it comes to making
673.464	money from the math,
675.965	the Americans are by a long shot
675.965	the world champions,
679.813	with clever, emblematic billionaires
679.813	and amazing, giant companies,
684.456	all resting, ultimately,
684.456	on good algorithm.
689.091	Now with all this beauty,
689.091	usefulness and wealth,
693.087	mathematics does look more sexy.
696.399	But don't you think
698.04	that the life a mathematical
698.04	researcher is an easy one.
702.959	It is filled with perplexity,
706.347	frustration,
708.172	a desperate fight for understanding.
711.955	Let me evoke for you
714.119	one of the most striking days
714.119	in my mathematician's life.
718.523	Or should I say,
719.698	one of the most striking nights.
722.713	At that time,
723.888	I was staying at the Institute
723.888	for Advanced Studies in Princeton --
727.063	for many years, the home
727.063	of Albert Einstein
729.226	and arguably the most holy place
729.226	for mathematical research in the world.
734.878	And that night I was working
734.878	and working on an elusive proof,
738.746	which was incomplete.
741.304	It was all about understanding
743.536	the paradoxical stability
743.536	property of plasmas,
747.383	which are a crowd of electrons.
750.423	In the perfect world of plasma,
753.183	there are no collisions
754.985	and no friction to provide
754.985	the stability like we are used to.
759.392	But still,
760.567	if you slightly perturb
760.567	a plasma equilibrium,
763.624	you will find that the
763.624	resulting electric field
766.336	spontaneously vanishes,
768.699	or damps out,
770.698	as if by some mysterious friction force.
774.728	This paradoxical effect,
776.587	called the Landau damping,
778.088	is one of the most important
778.088	in plasma physics,
781.101	and it was discovered
781.101	through mathematical ideas.
784.97	But still,
786.145	a full mathematical understanding
786.145	of this phenomenon was missing.
790.399	And together with my former student
790.399	and main collaborator Clément Mouhot,
795.209	in Paris at the time,
796.725	we had been working for months
796.725	and months on such a proof.
801.832	Actually,
803.191	I had already announced by mistake
803.191	that we could solve it.
807.961	But the truth is,
809.71	the proof was just not working.
812.196	In spite of more than 100 pages
812.196	of complicated, mathematical arguments,
816.569	and a bunch discoveries,
818.283	and huge calculation,
819.574	it was not working.
821.29	And that night in Princeton,
822.995	a certain gap in the chain of arguments
822.995	was driving me crazy.
827.658	I was putting in there all my energy
827.658	and experience and tricks,
832.275	and still nothing was working.
834.553	1 a.m., 2 a.m., 3 a.m.,
838.459	not working.
840.545	Around 4 a.m., I go to bed in low spirits.
845.915	Then a few hours later,
848.399	waking up and go,
849.574	"""Ah, it's time to get"
849.574	"the kids to school --"""
852.955	What is this?
854.13	There was this voice in my head, I swear.
856.894	"""Take the second term to the other side,"
858.831	"Fourier transform and invert in L2."""
861.257	(Laughter)
862.432	Damn it,
864.158	that was the start of the solution!
867.519	You see,
868.694	I thought I had taken some rest,
871.001	but really my brain had
871.001	continued to work on it.
875.008	In those moments,
876.629	you don't think of your career
876.629	or your colleagues,
879.254	it's just a complete battle
879.254	between the problem and you.
884.098	That being said,
885.45	it does not harm when you do get
885.45	a promotion in reward for your hard work.
889.808	And after we completed our huge
889.808	analysis of the Landau damping,
894.992	I was lucky enough
896.631	to get the most coveted Fields Medal
899.685	from the hands of the President of India,
902.576	in Hyderabad on 19 August, 2010 --
907.453	an honor that mathematicians
907.453	never dare to dream,
910.728	a day that I will remember until I live.
914.366	What do you think,
915.837	on such an occasion?
918.002	Pride, yes?
919.791	And gratitude to the many collaborators
919.791	who made this possible.
924.304	And because it was a collective adventure,
926.54	you need to share it,
926.54	not just with your collaborators.
931.548	I believe that everybody can appreciate
931.548	the thrill of mathematical research,
937.264	and share the passionate stories
937.264	of humans and ideas behind it.
942.494	And I've been working with my staff
942.494	at Institut Henri Poincaré,
947.292	together with partners and artists
947.292	of mathematical communication worldwide,
952.497	so that we can found our own,
952.497	very special museum of mathematics there.
958.537	So in a few years,
960.885	when you come to Paris,
962.486	after tasting the great, crispy
962.486	baguette and macaroon,
968.168	please come and visit us
968.168	at Institut Henri Poincaré,
971.856	and share the mathematical dream with us.
974.395	Thank you.
975.57	(Applause)
