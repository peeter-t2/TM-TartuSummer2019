12.557	Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
14.255	My name is Art Benjamin,
14.255	"and I am a ""mathemagician."""
18.16	What that means is, I combine
18.16	my loves of math and magic
21.16	"to do something I call ""mathemagics."""
24.16	But before I get started, I have
24.16	a quick question for the audience.
27.375	By any chance, did anyone happen
29.16	to bring with them
29.16	this morning a calculator?
33.371	Seriously, if you have a calculator
33.371	with you, raise your hand.
36.46	Raise your hand. Did your hand go up?
39.048	Now bring it out, bring it out.
39.048	Anybody else?
41.327	I see, I see one way in the back.
43.16	You sir, that's three.
45.16	And anybody on this side here?
48.008	OK, over there on the aisle.
49.532	Would the four of you
49.532	please bring out your calculators,
52.19	then join me up on stage.
53.635	Let's give them a nice round of applause.
55.899	(Applause)
58.736	That's right.
59.845	Now, since I haven't had the chance
59.845	to work with these calculators,
63.283	I need to make sure
63.283	that they are all working properly.
66.16	Would somebody get us started by giving us
66.16	a two-digit number, please?
71.514	How about a two-digit number?
73.047	Audience: 22.
74.16	AB: 22. And another two-digit number, sir?
76.192	Audience: 47.
77.223	AB: Multiply 22 times 47,
77.223	make sure you get 1,034,
81.16	or the calculators are not working.
82.921	Do all of you get 1,034? 1,034?
86.089	Volunteer: No.
87.16	AB: 594. Let's give three of them
87.16	a nice round of applause there.
91.16	(Applause)
93.16	Would you like to try a more
93.16	standard calculator, just in case?
96.413	OK, great.
97.549	What I'm going to try and do then --
99.296	I notice it took some of you
99.296	a little bit of time to get your answer.
102.605	That's OK.
103.63	I'll give you a shortcut for multiplying
103.63	even faster on the calculator.
107.16	There is something called
107.16	the square of a number,
109.705	which most of you know is taking a number
109.705	and multiplying it by itself.
113.389	For instance, five squared would be?
115.16	Audience: 25.
116.191	AB: 25. The way we can
116.191	square on most calculators --
118.693	let me demonstrate with this one --
120.408	is by taking the number, such as five,
122.866	"hitting ""times"" and then ""equals,"""
125.6	and on most calculators
125.6	that will give you the square.
128.378	On some of these ancient RPN calculators,
130.449	"you've got an ""x squared"" button on it,"
132.651	will allow you to do
132.651	the calculation even faster.
135.16	What I'm going to try and do
135.16	now is to square, in my head,
138.16	four two-digit numbers
140.16	faster than they can do
140.16	on their calculators,
142.531	even using the shortcut method.
144.399	What I'll use is the second row this time,
146.565	and I'll get four of you
148.097	to each yell out a two-digit number,
149.898	and if you would square the first number,
153.16	and if you would square the second,
153.16	the third and the fourth,
156.089	I will try and race you to the answer. OK?
158.578	So quickly, a two-digit number please.
161.161	Audience: 37.
162.247	Arthur Benjamin: 37 squared, OK.
164.136	Audience: 23.
165.16	AB: 23 squared, OK.
166.692	Audience: 59.
167.787	AB: 59 squared, OK, and finally?
169.867	Audience: 93.
170.916	AB: 93 squared.
171.988	Would you call out your answers, please?
174.924	Volunteer: 1369.
174.924	AB: 1369.
176.16	Volunteer: 529.
176.16	AB: 529.
178.16	Volunteer: 3481.
178.16	AB: 3481.
180.16	Volunteer: 8649.
181.207	AB: Thank you very much.
182.39	(Applause)
187.527	Let me try to take this one step further.
190.479	I'm going to try to square
190.479	some three-digit numbers this time.
193.524	I won't even write these down --
195.16	I'll just call them out
195.16	as they're called out to me.
197.661	Anyone I point to, call out
197.661	a three-digit number.
200.16	Anyone on our panel, verify the answer.
202.38	Just give some indication if it's right.
204.427	A three-digit number, sir, yes?
207.054	Audience: 987.
208.16	AB: 987 squared is 974,169.
211.643	(Laughter)
213.747	AB: Yes? Good.
215.441	Another three-digit --
217.161	(Applause)
219.115	-- another three-digit number, sir?
221.577	Audience: 457.
222.607	AB: 457 squared is 205,849.
227.946	AB: Yes?
228.972	OK, another, another
228.972	three-digit number, sir?
231.353	Audience: 321.
232.401	AB: 321 is 103,041.
237.485	Yes? One more three-digit number please.
240.327	Audience: Oh, 722.
241.509	AB: 722 is 500, that's a harder one.
244.437	Is that 513,284?
247.271	Volunteer: Yes.
248.35	AB: Yes? Oh, one more, one more
248.35	three-digit number please.
251.263	Audience: 162.
256.161	Volunteer: Yes.
257.271	Thank you very much.
258.304	(Applause)
263.763	(Applause ends)
265.16	Let me try to take this one step further.
268.16	(Laughter)
269.572	I'm going to try to square
269.572	a four-digit number this time.
273.16	You can all take your time on this;
274.921	I will not beat you
274.921	to the answer on this one,
277.139	but I will try to get the answer right.
279.065	To make this a little bit more random,
279.065	let's take the fourth row this time,
282.628	let's say, one, two, three, four.
284.306	If each of you would call out
284.306	a single digit between zero and nine,
287.504	that will be the four-digit
287.504	number that I'll square.
290.382	Nine.
291.771	Seven.
292.866	Five.
294.335	Eight.
295.398	9,758, this will take me a little bit
295.398	of time, so bear with me.
301.167	(Sighs)
307.904	Volunteer: Yes!
308.953	AB: Thank you very much.
310.215	(Applause)
316.653	(Applause ends)
318.16	Now, I would attempt to square
318.16	a five-digit number --
321.445	and I can --
322.978	but unfortunately,
322.978	most calculators cannot.
325.963	(Laughter)
327.953	Eight-digit capacity --
327.953	don't you hate that?
330.781	So, since we've reached
330.781	the limits of our calculators --
333.758	what's that?
335.416	Does yours go higher?
338.1	Volunteer: I don't know.
339.321	AB: Oh, yours does?
341.547	Volunteer: I can probably do it.
341.547	AB: I'll talk to you later.
344.479	In the meanwhile, let me conclude
346.16	the first part of my show by doing
346.16	something a little trickier.
349.185	Let's take the largest number
349.185	on the board here, 8649.
352.695	Would you each enter
352.695	that on your calculator?
355.16	And instead of squaring it this time,
357.16	I want you to take
357.16	that number and multiply it
359.375	by any three-digit number that you want,
362.16	but don't tell me
362.16	what you're multiplying by --
364.423	just multiply it by any random
364.423	three-digit number.
367.726	So you should have as an answer either
369.801	a six-digit or probably
369.801	a seven-digit number.
372.853	How many digits do you have, six or seven?
374.927	Seven, and yours?
376.205	Seven? Seven?
380.022	And, uncertain.
381.786	Seven.
382.82	Is there any possible way
382.82	that I could know
384.9	what seven-digit numbers you have?
386.6	"Say ""No."""
387.625	(Laughter)
388.964	Good, then I shall attempt
388.964	the impossible --
391.085	or at least the improbable.
393.16	What I'd like each of you
393.16	to do is to call out for me
395.708	any six of your seven digits,
395.708	any six of them,
398.744	in any order you'd like.
400.891	(Laughter)
402.247	One digit at a time,
403.694	I shall try and determine
403.694	the digit you've left out.
407.136	Starting with your seven-digit number,
409.032	call out any six of them please.
410.73	Volunteer: 1, 9, 7, 0, 4, 2.
416.105	AB: Did you leave out the number 6?
417.819	Good, OK, that's one.
419.16	You have a seven-digit number,
419.16	call out any six of them please.
422.16	Volunteer: 4, 4, 8, 7, 5.
425.533	I think I only heard five numbers.
425.533	I -- wait -- 44875 --
429.948	did you leave out the number 6?
431.481	Same as she did, OK.
432.595	You've got a seven-digit number --
434.247	call out any six of them loud and clear.
436.704	Volunteer: 0, 7, 9, 0, 4, 4.
440.42	I think you left out the number 3?
442.994	AB: That's three.
444.125	The odds of me getting
444.125	all four of these right by random guessing
447.311	would be one in 10,000:
449.834	OK, any six of them.
451.423	(Laughter)
452.501	Really scramble them up this time, please.
454.794	Volunteer: 2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2.
458.16	Did you leave out the number 7?
459.978	And let's give all four of these people
459.978	a nice round of applause.
463.222	Thank you very much.
464.78	(Applause)
470.322	(Applause ends)
473.013	For my next number --
474.16	(Laughter)
477.132	while I mentally recharge my batteries,
480.02	I have one more question for the audience.
482.692	By any chance, does anybody
482.692	here happen to know
487.16	the day of the week
487.16	that they were born on?
490.518	If you think you know
490.518	your birth day, raise your hand.
494.462	Let's see, starting with --
494.462	let's start with a gentleman first.
497.676	What year was it, first of all?
499.351	That's why I pick a gentleman first.
501.16	Audience: 1953.
504.16	November what?
508.094	Audience: Yes.
509.119	Good. Somebody else?
510.524	I haven't seen any women's hands up.
512.365	OK, how about you, what year?
516.746	October what?
518.16	Fifth -- was that a Wednesday?
519.89	Yes! I'll go way to the back
519.89	right now, how about you?
522.438	Yell it out, what year?
523.655	Audience: 1959.
527.555	Audience: February.
528.674	February what?
530.105	Sixth -- was that a Friday?
530.105	Audience: Yes.
532.16	Good, how about the person behind her?
534.413	Call out, what year was it?
536.16	Audience: 1947.
536.16	AB: 1947, and the month?
538.85	Audience: May.
538.85	AB: May what?
540.294	Seventh -- would that be a Wednesday?
542.389	Audience: Yes.
542.389	AB: Thank you very much.
544.739	(Applause)
549.767	Anybody here who'd like to know
549.767	the day of the week they were born?
552.965	We can do it that way.
554.133	Of course, I could just make up
554.133	an answer and you wouldn't know,
557.167	so I come prepared for that.
558.532	I brought with me a book of calendars.
561.714	It goes as far back into the past as 1800,
561.714	because you never know.
565.983	(Laughter)
567.534	I didn't mean to look at you, sir --
567.534	you were just sitting there.
570.675	(Laughter)
571.773	Anyway, Chris, you can help me
571.773	out here, if you wouldn't mind.
574.749	This is a book of calendars.
576.644	Who wanted to know their birth day?
578.46	What year was it, first of all?
580.16	Audience: 1966.
583.929	And what month?
585.477	Audience: April.
585.477	AB: April what?
587.136	Audience: 17th.
588.181	I believe that was a Sunday.
590.509	Can you confirm, Chris?
593.043	Chris Anderson: Yes.
594.117	AB: I'll tell you what, Chris:
595.659	as long as you have
595.659	that book in front of you,
597.872	do me a favor, turn to a year
597.872	outside of the 1900s,
601.16	either into the 1800s
601.16	or way into the 2000s --
604.021	that'll be a much greater
604.021	challenge for me.
606.077	AB: What year would you like?
606.077	CA: 1824.
608.16	AB: 1824, OK.
611.389	AB: And what month?
613.001	CA: June.
614.088	AB: June what?
614.088	CA: Sixth.
615.36	AB: Was that a Sunday?
617.744	CA: It was.
617.744	AB: And it was cloudy.
619.642	(Laughter)
620.975	Good, thank you very much.
622.705	(Applause)
627.298	(Applause ends)
628.831	But I'd like to wrap things up now
630.479	by alluding to something
630.479	from earlier in the presentation.
635.16	There was a gentleman up here
635.16	who had a 10-digit calculator.
638.507	Where is he, would you stand up,
644.94	OK, stand up for me just for a second,
647.16	so I can see where you are.
649.16	You have a 10-digit calculator,
649.16	sir, as well?
652.314	OK, what I'm going to try
652.314	and do, is to square in my head
655.868	a five-digit number requiring
655.868	a 10-digit calculator.
659.272	But to make my job more interesting
659.272	for you, as well as for me,
664.16	I'm going to do this problem
664.16	thinking out loud.
668.056	So you can actually, honestly hear
670.945	what's going on in my mind
670.945	while I do a calculation of this size.
675.687	Now, I have to apologize
675.687	to our magician friend Lennart Green.
678.991	I know as a magician we're not supposed
678.991	to reveal our secrets,
682.087	but I'm not too afraid
683.373	that people are going to start
683.373	doing my show next week, so --
686.28	I think we're OK.
687.867	(Laughter)
689.037	(Applause)
690.317	So, let's see,
692.992	let's take a different row of people,
692.992	starting with you.
695.959	I'll get five digits:
695.959	one, two, three, four.
698.16	Oh, I did this row already.
699.502	Let's do the row before you,
700.945	starting with you:
700.945	one, two, three, four, five.
703.238	Call out a single digit --
704.573	that will be the five-digit number
704.573	that I will try to square, go ahead.
709.396	Five.
710.983	Seven.
712.033	Six.
713.134	Eight.
714.636	Three.
720.739	squared.
721.852	Yuck.
723.496	Let me explain to you
723.496	how I'm going to attempt this problem.
728.16	I'm going to break the problem
728.16	down into three parts.
731.054	I'll do 57,000 squared,
733.726	plus 683 squared,
737.16	plus 57,000 times 683 times two.
742.643	Add all those numbers together,
744.761	and with any luck, arrive at the answer.
748.16	Now, let me recap.
750.006	(Laughter)
751.5	Thank you.
752.659	(Laughter)
754.556	While I explain something else --
756.453	(Laughter)
757.707	-- I know, that you can use, right?
759.842	(Laughter)
760.871	While I do these calculations,
762.642	you might hear certain words,
765.145	as opposed to numbers,
765.145	creep into the calculation.
768.16	Let me explain what that is.
769.582	This is a phonetic code,
771.688	a mnemonic device that I use,
773.788	that allows me to convert
773.788	numbers into words.
776.622	I store them as words, and later on
776.622	retrieve them as numbers.
779.788	I know it sounds complicated; it's not.
781.773	I don't want you to think you're seeing
781.773	"something out of ""Rain Man."""
785.129	(Laughter)
786.2	There's definitely
786.2	a method to my madness --
788.28	definitely, definitely.
789.532	Sorry.
790.557	(Laughter)
794.16	If you want to talk to me
794.16	about ADHD afterwards,
796.429	you can talk to me then.
798.16	By the way, one last instruction,
800.564	for my judges with the calculators --
802.94	you know who you are --
804.106	there is at least a 50 percent chance
804.106	that I will make a mistake here.
809.16	If I do, don't tell me
809.16	what the mistake is;
812.612	"just say, ""you're close,"""
812.612	or something like that,
814.968	and I'll try and figure out the answer --
816.968	which could be pretty
816.968	entertaining in itself.
819.16	If, however, I am right,
821.16	whatever you do,
821.16	don't keep it to yourself, OK?
824.16	(Laughter)
825.39	Make sure everybody knows
825.39	that I got the answer right,
828.628	because this is my big finish, OK.
830.338	So, without any more stalling,
833.552	here we go.
836.527	I'll start the problem
836.527	in the middle, with 57 times 683.
842.407	that's 38,760 plus 171,
853.16	cookie fission is 77,822.
857.16	That seems right, I'll go on.
857.16	Cookie fission, OK.
859.518	Next, I do 57 squared,
859.518	which is 3,249, so I can say,
863.788	three billion.
865.542	Take the 249, add that to cookie, 249,
868.16	oops, but I see a carry coming --
872.16	add that to cookie, 250 plus 77,
874.16	is 327 million --
878.16	fission, fission, OK,
878.16	finally, we do 683 squared,
881.167	that's 700 times 666, plus 17 squared
883.526	is 466,489, rev up if I need it,
886.16	rev up, take the 466,
888.565	add that to fission, to get,
891.716	oh gee --
898.16	Audience: Yeah!
898.16	AB: Good.
900.16	Thank you very much.
901.54	(Applause)
903.16	I hope you enjoyed mathemagics.
904.673	Thank you.
