25	When I'm starting talks like this,
27	I usually do a whole spiel about sustainability
30	because a lot of people out there don't know what that is.
32	This is a crowd that does know what it is,
34	so I'll like just do like the 60-second crib-note version. Right?
38	So just bear with me. We'll go real fast, you know?
40	Fill in the blanks.
41	So, you know, sustainability, small planet.
44	Right? Picture a little Earth, circling around the sun.
46	You know, about a million years ago,
47	a bunch of monkeys fell out of trees,
49	got a little clever, harnessed fire,
51	invented the printing press,
52	made, you know, luggage with wheels on it.
54	And, you know, built the society that we now live in.
58	Unfortunately, while this society is, without a doubt,
61	the most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created,
65	it's got some major, major flaws.
68	One of them is that every society has an ecological footprint.
72	It has an amount of impact on the planet that's measurable.
76	How much stuff goes through your life,
79	how much waste is left behind you.
82	And we, at the moment, in our society,
85	have a really dramatically unsustainable level of this.
89	We're using up about five planets.
91	If everybody on the planet lived the way we did,
94	we'd need between five, six, seven,
96	some people even say 10 planets to make it.
99	Clearly we don't have 10 planets.
101	Again, you know, mental, visual, 10 planets, one planet,
105	We don't have that. So that's one problem.
108	The second problem is that the planet that we have
110	is being used in wildly unfair ways. Right?
114	North Americans, such as myself, you know,
117	we're basically sort of wallowing, gluttonous hogs,
119	and we're eating all sorts of stuff.
121	And, you know, then you get all the way down
123	to people who live in the Asia-Pacific region, or even more, Africa.
127	And people simply do not have enough to survive.
129	This is producing all sorts of tensions,
131	all sorts of dynamics that are deeply disturbing.
134	And there's more and more people on the way. Right?
138	So, this is what the planet's going to look like in 20 years.
142	It's going to be a pretty crowded place, at least eight billion people.
145	So to make matters even more difficult, it's a very young planet.
149	A third of the people on this planet are kids.
152	And those kids are growing up in a completely different way
155	than their parents did, no matter where they live.
157	They've been exposed to this idea of our society, of our prosperity.
162	And they may not want to live exactly like us.
165	They may not want to be Americans, or Brits,
167	or Germans, or South Africans,
169	but they want their own version
171	of a life which is more prosperous, and more dynamic,
173	and more, you know, enjoyable.
175	And all of these things combine to create
178	an enormous amount of torque on the planet.
181	And if we cannot figure out a way to deal with that torque,
184	we are going to find ourselves more and more and more quickly
188	facing situations which are simply unthinkable.
192	Everybody in this room has heard the worst-case scenarios.
194	I don't need to go into that.
196	But I will ask the question, what's the alternative?
198	And I would say that, at the moment, the alternative is unimaginable.
203	You know, so on the one hand we have the unthinkable;
206	on the other hand we have the unimaginable.
208	We don't know yet how to build a society
211	which is environmentally sustainable,
213	which is shareable with everybody on the planet,
216	which promotes stability and democracy and human rights,
220	and which is achievable in the time-frame necessary
223	to make it through the challenges we face.
226	We don't know how to do this yet.
228	So what's Worldchanging?
230	Well, Worldchanging you might think of
232	as being a bit of a news service for the unimaginable future.
237	You know, what we're out there doing is looking
239	for examples of tools, models and ideas,
242	which, if widely adopted, would change the game.
246	A lot of times, when I do a talk like this, I talk about things
249	that everybody in this room I'm sure has already heard of,
252	but most people haven't.
254	So I thought today I'd do something a little different,
256	and talk about what we're looking for, rather than saying, you know,
259	rather than giving you tried-and-true examples.
262	Talk about the kinds of things we're scoping out.
264	Give you a little peek into our editorial notebook.
266	And given that I have 13 minutes to do this, this is going to go kind of quick.
269	So, I don't know, just stick with me. Right?
271	So, first of all, what are we looking for? Bright Green city.
274	One of the biggest levers that we have in the developed world
277	for changing the impact that we have on the planet
279	is changing the way that we live in cities.
281	We're already an urban planet;
282	that's especially true in the developed world.
285	And people who live in cities in the developed world
287	tend to be very prosperous, and thus use a lot of stuff.
289	If we can change the dynamic,
291	by first of all creating cities that are denser and more livable ...
294	Here, for example, is Vancouver, which if you haven't been there,
296	you ought to go for a visit. It's a fabulous city.
298	And they are doing density, new density,
300	better than probably anybody else on the planet right now.
302	They're actually managing to talk North Americans out of driving cars,
305	which is a pretty great thing.
307	So you have density. You also have growth management.
309	You leave aside what is natural to be natural.
312	This is in Portland. That is an actual development.
315	That land there will remain pasture in perpetuity.
317	They've bounded the city with a line.
319	Nature, city. Nothing changes.
322	Once you do those things, you can start making all sorts of investments.
325	You can start doing things like, you know,
327	transit systems that actually work to transport people,
330	in effective and reasonably comfortable manners.
333	You can also start to change what you build.
335	This is the Beddington Zero Energy Development in London,
338	which is one of the greenest buildings in the world. It's a fabulous place.
341	We're able to now build buildings that generate all their own electricity,
344	that recycle much of their water,
346	that are much more comfortable than standard buildings,
349	use all-natural light, etc., and, over time, cost less.
353	Green roofs. Bill McDonough covered that last night, so I won't dwell on that too much.
357	But once you also have people living
359	in close proximity to each other,
361	one of the things you can do is --
363	as information technologies develop --
365	you can start to have smart places.
367	You can start to know where things are.
369	When you know where things are, it becomes easier to share them.
371	When you share them, you end up using less.
374	So one great example is car-share clubs,
376	which are really starting to take off in the U.S.,
378	have already taken off in many places in Europe, and are a great example.
381	If you're somebody who drives, you know, one day a week,
383	do you really need your own car?
386	Another thing that information technology lets us do
388	is start figuring out how to use less stuff
390	by knowing, and by monitoring, the amount we're actually using.
395	So, here's a power cord which glows brighter the more energy that you use,
398	which I think is a pretty cool concept,
400	although I think it ought to work the other way around,
402	that it gets brighter the more you don't use.
405	But, you know, there may even be a simpler approach.
407	We could just re-label things.
409	This light switch that reads, on the one hand, flashfloods,
411	and on the other hand, off.
413	How we build things can change as well.
415	This is a bio-morphic building.
417	It takes its inspiration in form from life.
421	Many of these buildings are incredibly beautiful,
423	and also much more effective.
426	This is an example of bio-mimicry,
428	which is something we're really starting to look a lot more for.
430	In this case, you have a shell design
432	which was used to create a new kind of exhaust fan, which is greatly more effective.
436	There's a lot of this stuff happening; it's really pretty remarkable.
440	I encourage you to look on Worldchanging if you're into it.
442	We're starting to cover this more and more.
444	There's also neo-biological design,
446	where more and more we're actually using life itself
448	and the processes of life to become part of our industry.
451	So this, for example, is hydrogen-generating algae.
454	So we have a model in potential, an emerging model that we're looking for
458	of how to take the cities most of us live in,
461	and turn them into Bright Green cities.
463	But unfortunately, most of the people on the planet don't live in the cites we live in.
468	They live in the emerging megacities of the developing world.
471	And there's a statistic I often like to use,
473	which is that we're adding a city of Seattle every four days,
476	a city the size of Seattle to the planet every four days.
479	I was giving a talk about two months ago,
481	and this guy, who'd done some work with the U.N., came up to me
483	and was really flustered, and he said, look,
485	you've got that totally wrong; it's totally wrong.
487	It's every seven days.
490	So, we're adding a city the size of Seattle every seven days,
493	and most of those cities look more like this than the city that you or I live in.
497	Most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly.
500	They don't have existing infrastructure;
502	they have enormous numbers of people who are struggling with poverty,
505	and enormous numbers of people are trying to figure out
507	how to do things in new ways.
509	So what do we need in order to make developing nation
513	megacities into Bright Green megacities?
516	Well, the first thing we need is, we need leapfrogging.
519	And this is one of the things that we are looking for everywhere.
522	The idea behind leapfrogging is that
524	if you are a person, or a country, who is stuck in a situation
527	where you don't have the tools and technologies that you need,
530	there's no reason for you to invest in last generation's technologies. Right?
536	That you're much better off, almost universally,
538	looking for a low-cost or locally applicable version of the newest technology.
543	One place we're all familiar with seeing this is with cell phones. Right?
547	All throughout the developing world, people are going directly to cell phones,
551	skipping the whole landline stage.
553	If there are landlines in many developing world cities,
555	they're usually pretty crappy systems that break down a lot
558	and cost enormous amounts of money.
560	So I rather like this picture here.
562	I particularly like the Ganesh in the background, talking on the cell phone.
566	So what we have, increasingly, is cell phones just permeating out through society.
570	We've heard all about this here this week,
572	so I won't say too much more than that, other than to say
574	what is true for cell phones is true for all sorts of technologies.
579	The second thing is tools for collaboration,
582	be they systems of collaboration, or intellectual property systems
585	which encourage collaboration. Right?
587	When you have free ability for people to freely work together and innovate,
591	you get different kinds of solutions.
593	And those solutions are accessible in a different way
596	to people who don't have capital. Right?
598	So, you know, we have open source software,
601	we have Creative Commons and other kinds of Copyleft solutions.
606	And those things lead to things like this.
608	This is a Telecentro in Sao Paulo.
611	This is a pretty remarkable program
613	using free and open source software, cheap, sort of hacked-together machines,
617	and basically sort of abandoned buildings --
620	has put together a bunch of community centers
622	where people can come in, get high-speed internet access,
625	learn computer programming skills for free.
629	And a quarter-million people every year use these now in Sao Paulo.
633	And those quarter-million people are some of the poorest people in Sao Paolo.
636	I particularly like the little Linux penguin in the back. (Laughter)
640	So one of the things that that's leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion.
645	And one of the things we're really, really interested in at Worldchanging
648	is the ways in which the south is re-identifying itself,
652	and re-categorizing itself in ways
655	that have less and less to do with most of us in this room.
658	So it's not, you know, Bollywood isn't just answering Hollywood. Right?
663	You know, Brazilian music scene isn't just answering the major labels.
666	It's doing something new. There's new things happening.
669	There's interplay between them. And, you know, you get amazing things.
672	"Like, I don't know if any of you have seen the movie ""City of God?"""
675	Yeah, it's a fabulous movie if you haven't seen it.
678	And it's all about this question, in a very artistic and indirect kind of way.
681	You have other radical examples
683	where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out.
686	These are people who have just been visited by
688	the Internet bookmobile in Uganda.
690	And who are waving their first books in the air,
692	which, I just think that's a pretty cool picture. You know?
695	So you also have the ability for people to start coming together
699	and acting on their own behalf in political and civic ways,
705	in ways that haven't happened before.
708	And as we heard last night, as we've heard earlier this week,
710	are absolutely, fundamentally vital to the ability to craft new solutions,
716	is we've got to craft new political realities.
719	And I would personally say that we have to craft new political realities,
723	not only in places like India, Afghanistan, Kenya, Pakistan,
728	what have you, but here at home as well.
730	Another world is possible.
732	And sort of the big motto of the anti-globalization movement. Right?
736	We tweak that a lot.
738	We talk about how another world isn't just possible; another world's here.
741	That it's not just that we have to sort of imagine
743	there being a different, vague possibility out there,
747	but we need to start acting a little bit more on that possibility.
751	We need to start doing things like Lula, President of Brazil.
754	How many people knew of Lula before today?
757	OK, so, much, much better than the average crowd, I can tell you that.
761	So Lula, he's full of problems, full of contradictions,
763	but one of the things that he's doing is,
765	he is putting forward an idea of how we engage in international relations that
771	completely shifts the balance from the standard sort of north-south dialogue
777	into a whole new way of global collaboration.
781	I would keep your eye on this fellow.
784	Another example of this sort of second superpower thing
787	"is the rise of these games that are what we call ""serious play."""
791	We're looking a lot at this. This is spreading everywhere.
793	"This is from ""A Force More Powerful."" It's a little screenshot."
796	"""A Force More Powerful"" is a video game that,"
798	while you're playing it, it teaches you how to engage
801	in non-violent insurrection and regime change. (Laughter)
803	"Here's another one. This is from a game called ""Food Force,"""
806	which is a game that teaches children how to run a refugee camp.
810	These things are all contributing in a very dynamic way
814	to a huge rise in, especially in the developing world,
819	in people's interest in and passion for democracy.
822	We get so little news about the developing world
825	that we often forget that there are literally
829	millions of people out there struggling to change things
831	to be fairer, freer, more democratic, less corrupt.
835	And, you know, we don't hear those stories enough.
837	But it's happening all over the place,
839	and these tools are part of what's making it possible.
841	Now when you add all those things together,
843	when you add together leapfrogging and new kinds of tools,
845	you know, second superpower stuff, etc., what do you get?
849	Well, very quickly, you get a Bright Green future for the developing world.
853	You get, for example, green power spread throughout the world.
857	You get -- this is a building in Hyderabad, India.
859	It's the greenest building in the world.
861	You get grassroots solutions, things that work
863	for people who have no capital or limited access.
865	You get barefoot solar engineers carrying solar panels into the remote mountains.
869	You get access to distance medicine.
871	These are Indian nurses learning how to use PDAs
874	to access databases that have information
876	that they don't have access to at home in a distant manner.
879	You get new tools for people in the developing world.
882	These are LED lights that help the roughly billion people out there,
886	for whom nightfall means darkness,
888	to have a new means of operating.
890	These are refrigerators that require no electricity;
893	they're pot within a pot design.
895	And you get water solutions. Water's one of the most pressing problems.
898	Here's a design for harvesting rainwater that's super cheap
900	and available to people in the developing world.
902	Here's a design for distilling water using sunlight.
907	Here's a fog-catcher, which, if you live in a moist, jungle-like area,
912	will distill water from the air that's clean and drinkable.
915	Here's a way of transporting water.
917	I just love this, you know -- I mean carrying water is such a drag,
920	and somebody just came up with the idea of well, what if you rolled it. Right?
923	I mean, that's a great design.
925	This is a fabulous invention, LifeStraw.
928	Basically you can suck any water through this
931	and it will become drinkable by the time it hits your lips.
934	So, you know, people who are in desperate straits can get this.
937	This is one of my favorite Worldchanging kinds of things ever.
940	This is a merry-go-round invented by the company Roundabout,
943	which pumps water as kids play. You know?
948	Seriously -- give that one a hand, it's pretty great.
951	And the same thing is true for people who are in absolute crisis. Right?
955	We're expecting to have upwards of 200 million refugees by the year 2020
959	because of climate change and political instability.
961	How do we help people like that?
963	Well, there's all sorts of amazing new humanitarian designs
965	that are being developed in collaborative ways all across the planet.
968	Some of those designs include models for acting,
971	such as new models for village instruction in the middle of refugee camps.
974	New models for pedagogy for the displaced.
977	And we have new tools.
979	This is one of my absolute favorite things anywhere.
981	Does anyone know what this is?
983	Audience: It detects landmines.
984	Alex Steffen: Exactly, this is a landmine-detecting flower.
988	If you are living in one of the places
990	where the roughly half-billion unaccounted for mines are scattered,
993	you can fling these seeds out into the field.
996	And as they grow up, they will grow up around the mines,
1000	their roots will detect the chemicals in them,
1003	and where the flowers turn red you don't step.
1008	Yeah, so seeds that could save your life. You know?
1012	(Applause)
1013	I also love it because it seems to me
1015	that the example, the tools we use to change the world,
1021	ought to be beautiful in themselves.
1024	You know, that it's not just enough to survive.
1026	We've got to make something better than what we've got.
1030	And I think that we will.
1033	Just to wrap up, in the immortal words of H.G. Wells,
1036	I think that better things are on the way.
1038	"I think that, in fact, that ""all of the past is but the beginning of a beginning."
1042	All that the human mind has accomplished
1044	"is but the dream before the awakening."""
1046	I hope that that turns out to be true.
1049	The people in this room have given me more confidence than ever that it will.
1052	Thank you very much.
1053	(Applause)
