15.26	I've always had a fascination
15.26	for computers and technology,
19.63	and I made a few apps for the iPhone,
19.63	iPod touch, and iPad.
23.354	I'd like to share a couple with you today.
26.449	My first app was a unique
26.449	"fortune teller called ""Earth Fortune"""
30.544	that would display
30.544	different colors of Earth
32.957	depending on what your fortune was.
35.53	My favorite and most successful app
39.277	"is ""Bustin Jieber,"" which is --"
41.162	(Laughter)
42.409	which is a Justin Bieber whack-a-mole.
45.127	(Laughter)
46.46	I created it because
46.46	a lot of people at school
49.867	disliked Justin Bieber a little bit,
52.208	so I decided to make the app.
54.978	So I went to work programming it,
57.157	and I released it
57.157	just before the holidays in 2010.
61.984	A lot of people ask me,
61.984	how did I make these?
65.76	A lot of times it's because
65.76	the person who asked the question
68.676	wants to make an app also.
70.722	A lot of kids these days
70.722	like to play games,
73.849	but now they want to make them,
73.849	and it's difficult,
77.403	because not many kids know where to go
77.403	to find out how to make a program.
82.363	I mean, for soccer,
82.363	you could go to a soccer team.
84.882	For violin, you could get
84.882	lessons for a violin.
87.923	But what if you want to make an app?
89.934	And the kid's parents might have done
89.934	some of these things when they were young,
93.965	but not many parents have written apps.
95.847	(Laughter)
98.178	Where do you go to find out
98.178	how to make an app?
100.751	Well, this is how I approached it,
100.751	this is what I did.
103.511	First of all, I've been programming
103.511	in multiple other programming languages
108.709	to get the basics down,
110.743	such as Python, C, Java, etc.
115.021	And then Apple released the iPhone,
117.518	and with it, the iPhone
117.518	software development kit,
120.556	and the software development kit
120.556	is a suite of tools
124.159	for creating and programming
124.159	an iPhone app.
128.148	This opened up a whole new world
128.148	of possibilities for me,
131.5	and after playing with the software
131.5	development kit a little bit,
134.794	I made a couple of apps,
134.794	I made some test apps.
138.705	One of them happened to be
138.705	"""Earth Fortune,"""
140.872	and I was ready to put
140.872	"""Earth Fortune"" on the App Store,"
143.764	and so I persuaded my parents
143.764	to pay the 99 dollar fee
148.163	to be able to put my apps
148.163	on the App Store.
150.983	They agreed, and now I have
150.983	apps on the App Store.
155.34	I've gotten a lot of interest
155.34	and encouragement
157.647	from my family, friends, teachers
157.647	and even people at the Apple Store,
161.34	and that's been a huge help to me.
164.376	I've gotten a lot
164.376	of inspiration from Steve Jobs,
167.502	and I've started an app club at school,
170.435	and a teacher at my school
170.435	is kindly sponsoring my app club.
176.081	Any student at my school can come
176.081	and learn how to design an app.
182.534	This is so I can share
182.534	my experiences with others.
186.664	There's these programs
186.664	called the iPad Pilot Program,
190.226	and some districts have them.
192.82	I'm fortunate enough to be part of one.
195.503	A big challenge is,
195.503	how should the iPads be used,
199.526	and what apps should we put on the iPads?
202.974	So we're getting feedback
202.974	from teachers at the school
206.8	to see what kind of apps they'd like.
208.892	When we design the app and we sell it,
211.7	it will be free to local districts;
211.7	and other districts that we sell to --
218.143	all the money from that will go
218.143	into the local ed foundations.
223.036	These days, students usually know
223.036	a little bit more than teachers
228.138	with the technology.
229.722	(Laughter)
234.061	So --
235.309	(Laughter)
238.272	Sorry.
239.482	(Laughter)
242.796	So this is a resource to teachers,
244.899	and educators should recognize
244.899	this resource and make good use of it.
249.018	(Laughter)
251.593	I'd like to finish up by saying
251.593	what I'd like to do in the future.
256.333	First of all, I'd like to create
256.333	more apps, more games.
260.336	I'm working with a third party
260.336	company to make an app.
264.001	I'd like to get into Android
264.001	programming and development,
267.919	and I'd like to continue my app club,
270.23	and find other ways for students
270.23	to share knowledge with others.
273.879	Thank you.
275.062	(Applause)
