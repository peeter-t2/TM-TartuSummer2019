13.643	All right, so let's take
14.782	four subjects that obviously go together:
17.122	big data, tattoos, immortality and the Greeks.
21.851	Right?
22.681	Now, the issue about tattoos is that,
26.1	without a word, tattoos really do shout.
30.305	[Beautiful]
34.365	[Intriguing]
36.263	So you don't have to say a lot.
39.578	[Allegiance]
43.246	[Very intimate]
47.648	[Serious mistakes]
50.273	(Laughter)
54.437	And tattoos tell you a lot of stories.
58.218	If I can ask an indiscreet question,
59.963	how many of you have tattoos?
63.439	A few, but not most.
64.946	What happens if Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn,
67.733	cell phones, GPS, Foursquare, Yelp, Travel Advisor,
70.631	all these things you deal with every day
73.391	turn out to be electronic tattoos?
75.751	And what if they provide as much information
77.373	about who and what you are as any tattoo ever would?
82.35	What's ended up happening over the past few decades
84.536	is the kind of coverage that you had as a head of state
87.642	or as a great celebrity
90.321	is now being applied to you every day by all these people
93.042	who are Tweeting, blogging, following you,
96.029	watching your credit scores and what you do to yourself.
100.349	And electronic tattoos also shout.
104.763	And as you're thinking of the consequences of that,
107.107	it's getting really hard to hide from this stuff, among other things,
110.043	because it's not just the electronic tattoos,
112.822	it's facial recognition that's getting really good.
116.894	So you can take a picture with an iPhone and get all the names,
120.692	although, again, sometimes it does make mistakes. (Laughter)
124.749	But that means you can take a typical bar scene like this,
127.758	take a picture, say, of this guy right here,
131.766	get the name, and download all the records
135.43	before you utter a word or speak to somebody,
139.049	because everybody turns out to be
140.425	absolutely plastered by electronic tattoos.
144.026	And so there's companies like face.com that now have
146.518	about 18 billion faces online.
150.302	Here's what happened to this company.
151.891	[Company sold to Facebook, June 18, 2012...]
154.554	There are other companies that will place a camera
157.207	like this — this has nothing to do with Facebook —
159.63	they take your picture, they tie it to the social media,
161.942	they figure out you really like to wear black dresses,
164.069	so maybe the person in the store comes up and says,
166.505	"""Hey, we've got five black dresses"
168.805	"that would just look great on you."""
172.038	So what if Andy was wrong?
174.158	Here's Andy's theory.
175.428	[In the future, everybody will be world famous for 15 minutes.]
177.272	What if we flip this?
178.378	What if you're only going to be anonymous for 15 minutes? (Laughter)
183.059	Well, then, because of electronic tattoos,
186.075	maybe all of you and all of us are very close to immortality,
190.736	because these tattoos will live
192.314	far longer than our bodies will.
195.091	And if that's true, then what we want to do
196.982	is we want to go through four lessons from the Greeks
200.391	and one lesson from a Latin American.
203.7	Why the Greeks?
205.523	Well, the Greeks thought about what happens
207.38	when gods and humans and immortality mix for a long time.
212.338	So lesson number one: Sisyphus.
215.018	Remember? He did a horrible thing, condemned for all time
218.044	to roll this rock up, it would roll back down,
220.427	roll back up, roll back down.
222.4	It's a little like your reputation.
224.803	Once you get that electronic tattoo,
226.238	you're going to be rolling up and down for a long time,
229.166	so as you go through this stuff,
231.474	just be careful what you post.
234.559	Myth number two: Orpheus, wonderful guy,
237.938	charming to be around, great partier, great singer,
241.666	loses his beloved, charms his way into the underworld,
244.883	only person to charm his way into the underworld,
247.49	charms the gods of the underworld,
249.835	they release his beauty on the condition
252.73	he never look at her until they're out.
255.842	So he's walking out and walking out and walking out
257.681	and he just can't resist. He looks at her, loses her forever.
261.939	With all this data out here, it might be a good idea
264.773	not to look too far into the past of those you love.
270.521	Lesson number three: Atalanta.
273.362	Greatest runner. She would challenge anybody.
277.811	If you won, she would marry you.
280.221	If you lost, you died.
283.146	How did Hippomenes beat her?
285.49	Well, he had all these wonderful little golden apples,
287.416	and she'd run ahead, and he'd roll a little golden apple.
290.034	She'd run ahead, and he'd roll a little golden apple.
292.038	She kept getting distracted. He eventually won the race.
296.284	Just remember the purpose as all these little golden apples
299.514	come and reach you and you want to post about them
302.086	or tweet about them or send a late-night message.
305.922	And then, of course, there's Narcissus.
309.17	Nobody here would ever be accused or be familiar with Narcissus.
312.717	(Laughter)
315.013	But as you're thinking about Narcissus,
317.581	just don't fall in love with your own reflection.
321.661	Last lesson, from a Latin American:
323.452	This is the great poet Jorge Luis Borges.
326.213	When he was threatened by the thugs
327.402	of the Argentine military junta,
330.035	"he came back and said, ""Oh, come on,"
332.288	"how else can you threaten, other than with death?"""
335.733	The interesting thing, the original thing,
338.853	would be to threaten somebody with immortality.
342.045	And that, of course, is what we are all
343.505	now threatened with today because of electronic tattoos.
347.681	Thank you.
348.766	(Applause)
