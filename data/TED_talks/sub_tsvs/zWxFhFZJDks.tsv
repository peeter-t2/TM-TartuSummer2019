15.513	B.J. was one of many fellow inmates
18.383	who had big plans for the future.
20.668	He had a vision. When he got out,
22.899	he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight,
25.754	and he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision.
30.881	He'd spent 10,000 dollars
32.395	to buy a website that exclusively featured women
35.679	having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars. (Laughter)
41.568	It was my first week in federal prison,
44.554	and I was learning quickly that it wasn't what you see on TV.
48.371	In fact, it was teeming with smart, ambitious men
52.274	whose business instincts were in many cases
55.015	as sharp as those of the CEOs
57.417	who had wined and dined me six months earlier
59.246	when I was a rising star in the Missouri Senate.
63.798	Now, 95 percent of the guys that I was locked up with
66.639	had been drug dealers on the outside,
69.379	but when they talked about what they did,
72.787	they talked about it in a different jargon,
75.49	but the business concepts that they talked about
77.274	weren't unlike those that you'd learn in a first year MBA class at Wharton:
80.954	promotional incentives, you never charge a first-time user,
85.458	focus-grouping new product launches,
89.029	territorial expansion.
91.266	But they didn't spend a lot of time reliving the glory days.
94.537	For the most part, everyone was just trying to survive.
97.386	It's a lot harder than you might think.
99.583	Contrary to what most people think,
102.37	people don't pay, taxpayers don't pay, for your life
105.748	when you're in prison. You've got to pay for your own life.
107.538	You've got to pay for your soap, your deodorant,
110.29	toothbrush, toothpaste, all of it.
112.588	And it's hard for a couple of reasons.
113.94	First, everything's marked up 30 to 50 percent
116.335	from what you'd pay on the street,
117.702	and second, you don't make a lot of money.
120.284	I unloaded trucks. That was my full-time job,
122.553	unloading trucks at a food warehouse,
124.842	for $5.25, not an hour, but per month.
129.195	So how do you survive?
131.353	Well, you learn to hustle, all kinds of hustles.
134.872	There's legal hustles.
136.471	You pay everything in stamps. Those are the currency.
138.639	You charge another inmate to clean his cell.
141.055	There's sort of illegal hustles, like you run a barbershop out of your cell.
145.958	There's pretty illegal hustles: You run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell.
150.18	And there's very illegal hustles, which you smuggle in,
153.463	you get smuggled in, drugs, pornography,
157.566	cell phones, and just as in the outer world,
161.033	there's a risk-reward tradeoff, so the riskier the enterprise,
164.536	the more profitable it can potentially be.
166.4	You want a cigarette in prison? Three to five dollars.
171.336	You want an old-fashioned cell phone that you flip open
174.641	and is about as big as your head? Three hundred bucks.
178.287	You want a dirty magazine?
180.623	Well, it can be as much as 1,000 dollars.
184.007	So as you can probably tell, one of the defining aspects
187.113	of prison life is ingenuity.
190.663	Whether it was concocting delicious meals
193.067	from stolen scraps from the warehouse,
197.266	sculpting people's hair with toenail clippers,
200.416	or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags
206.04	tied on to tree limbs, prisoners learn how to make do with less,
210.809	and many of them want to take this ingenuity
213.48	that they've learned to the outside
215.666	and start restaurants, barber shops,
217.912	personal training businesses.
220.257	But there's no training, nothing to prepare them for that,
223.752	no rehabilitation at all in prison,
226.047	no one to help them write a business plan,
228.248	figure out a way to translate the business concepts
231.506	they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises,
234.529	no access to the Internet, even.
237.104	And then, when they come out, most states
239.688	don't even have a law prohibiting employers
242.04	from discriminating against people with a background.
245.76	So none of us should be surprised
248.064	that two out of three ex-offenders re-offend
250.908	within five years.
253.496	Look, I lied to the Feds. I lost a year of my life from it.
258.808	But when I came out, I vowed that I was going to do
262.467	whatever I could to make sure
264.293	that guys like the ones I was locked up with
266.726	didn't have to waste any more of their life than they already had.
270.773	So I hope that you'll think about helping in some way.
274.421	The best thing we can do is figure out ways
276.989	to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit
279.677	and the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons,
282.921	because if we don't, they're not going to learn any new skills
285.996	that's going to help them, and they'll be right back.
288.545	All they'll learn on the inside is new hustles.
291.421	Thank you. (Applause)
