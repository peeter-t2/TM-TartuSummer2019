12.658	So I've had the great privilege
14.738	of traveling to some incredible places,
17.178	photographing these distant landscapes
17.178	and remote cultures
21.436	all over the world.
22.886	I love my job.
24.32	But people think it's
24.32	this string of epiphanies
26.909	and sunrises and rainbows,
29.422	when in reality, it looks
29.422	more something like this.
32.21	(Laughter)
33.456	This is my office.
35.473	We can't afford the fanciest places
35.473	to stay at night,
38.128	so we tend to sleep a lot outdoors.
41.365	As long as we can stay dry,
42.818	that's a bonus.
44.243	We also can't afford
44.243	the fanciest restaurants.
46.672	So we tend to eat
46.672	whatever's on the local menu.
50.045	And if you're in the Ecuadorian PÃ¡ramo,
53.141	you're going to eat
53.141	a large rodent called a cuy.
55.927	(Laughter)
57.568	But what makes our experiences
57.568	perhaps a little bit different
61.21	and a little more unique
61.21	than that of the average person
63.956	is that we have this gnawing thing
63.956	in the back of our mind
67.436	that even in our darkest moments,
67.436	and those times of despair,
71.377	"we think, ""Hey, there might be"
71.377	an image to be made here,
75.303	"there might be a story to be told."""
78.164	And why is storytelling important?
80.509	Well, it helps us to connect with our
80.509	cultural and our natural heritage.
85.063	And in the Southeast,
86.246	there's an alarming disconnect
86.246	between the public
89.328	and the natural areas that allow
89.328	us to be here in the first place.
93.77	We're visual creatures,
95.999	so we use what we see
95.999	to teach us what we know.
99.773	Now the majority of us
99.773	aren't going to willingly go
102.195	way down to a swamp.
104.638	So how can we still expect
104.638	those same people to then advocate
108.256	on behalf of their protection?
110.41	We can't.
111.608	So my job, then, is to use photography
111.608	as a communication tool,
115.877	to help bridge the gap
115.877	between the science and the aesthetics,
119.876	to get people talking,
121.518	to get them thinking,
122.911	and to hopefully, ultimately,
124.592	get them caring.
126.841	I started doing this 15 years ago
126.841	right here in Gainesville,
129.775	right here in my backyard.
131.674	And I fell in love
131.674	with adventure and discovery,
134.546	going to explore
134.546	all these different places
136.627	that were just minutes
136.627	from my front doorstep.
138.944	There are a lot
138.944	of beautiful places to find.
141.872	Despite all these years that have passed,
144.198	I still see the world
144.198	through the eyes of a child
146.516	and I try to incorporate
146.516	that sense of wonderment
149.393	and that sense of curiosity
149.393	into my photography
154.098	as often as I can.
157.006	And we're pretty lucky
157.006	because here in the South,
159.328	we're still blessed
159.328	with a relatively blank canvas
162.424	that we can fill with the most
162.424	fanciful adventures
165.632	and incredible experiences.
168.103	It's just a matter of how far
168.103	our imagination will take us.
172.402	See, a lot of people
172.402	look at this and they say,
174.625	"""Oh yeah, wow, that's a pretty tree."""
176.427	But I don't just see a tree --
177.922	I look at this and I see opportunity.
180.525	I see an entire weekend.
183.122	Because when I was a kid,
183.122	these were the types of images
185.783	that got me off the sofa
185.783	and dared me to explore,
188.275	dared me to go find the woods
189.74	and put my head underwater
189.74	and see what we have.
193.433	And folks, I've been photographing
193.433	all over the world
196.258	and I promise you,
197.623	what we have here in the South,
199.142	what we have in the Sunshine State,
200.847	rivals anything else that I've seen.
203.943	But yet our tourism industry is busy
203.943	promoting all the wrong things.
208.698	Before most kids are 12,
208.698	they'll have been to Disney World
211.453	more times than they've been in a canoe
213.438	or camping under a starry sky.
216.816	And I have nothing against Disney
216.816	or Mickey; I used to go there, too.
220.387	But they're missing out on those
220.387	fundamental connections
223.07	that create a real sense
223.07	of pride and ownership
226.316	for the place that they call home.
229.251	And this is compounded by the issue
229.251	that the landscapes
232.314	that define our natural heritage
234.447	and fuel our aquifer
234.447	for our drinking water
237.447	have been deemed as scary
237.447	and dangerous and spooky.
242.329	When our ancestors first came here,
244.106	"they warned, ""Stay out"
244.106	of these areas, they're haunted.
246.766	"They're full of evil spirits and ghosts."""
249.887	I don't know where
249.887	they came up with that idea.
252.804	But it's actually led
252.804	to a very real disconnect,
255.46	a very real negative mentality
257.245	that has kept the public
257.245	disinterested, silent,
260.847	and ultimately, our environment at risk.
264.523	We're a state that's surrounded
264.523	and defined by water,
267.999	and yet for centuries,
269.299	swamps and wetlands have been regarded
271.216	as these obstacles to overcome.
274.367	And so we've treated them
274.367	as these second-class ecosystems,
278.373	because they have
278.373	very little monetary value
280.661	and of course, they're known
280.661	to harbor alligators and snakes --
284.37	which, I'll admit, these aren't
284.37	the most cuddly of ambassadors.
287.692	(Laughter)
288.852	So it became assumed, then,
288.852	that the only good swamp
291.654	was a drained swamp.
293.364	And in fact,
294.539	draining a swamp to make way
294.539	for agriculture and development
297.974	was considered the very essence
297.974	of conservation not too long ago.
302.522	But now we're backpedaling,
304.092	because the more we come to learn
304.092	about these sodden landscapes,
307.467	the more secrets we're starting to unlock
309.457	about interspecies relationships
311.844	and the connectivity of habitats,
311.844	watersheds and flyways.
317.04	Take this bird, for example:
319.049	this is the prothonotary warbler.
320.961	I love this bird because
320.961	it's a swamp bird,
323.171	through and through, a swamp bird.
324.899	They nest and they mate and they breed
324.899	in these old-growth swamps
328.571	in these flooded forests.
330.059	And so after the spring,
330.059	after they raise their young,
332.631	they then fly thousand of miles
332.631	over the Gulf of Mexico
335.46	into Central and South America.
337.806	And then after the winter,
339.082	the spring rolls around
339.082	and they come back.
341.121	They fly thousands of miles
341.121	over the Gulf of Mexico.
344.044	And where do they go? Where do they land?
347.474	Right back in the same tree.
350.686	That's nuts.
352.151	This is a bird the size
352.151	of a tennis ball --
355.522	I mean, that's crazy!
357.223	I used a GPS to get here today,
359.797	and this is my hometown.
361.488	(Laughter)
362.783	It's crazy.
364.374	So what happens, then, when this bird
364.374	flies over the Gulf of Mexico
368.088	into Central America for the winter
369.98	and then the spring rolls around
369.98	and it flies back,
372.445	and it comes back to this:
375.236	a freshly sodded golf course?
377.942	This is a narrative that's
377.942	all too commonly unraveling
380.555	here in this state.
381.766	And this is a natural process
381.766	that's occurred for thousands of years
385.029	and we're just now learning about it.
386.831	So you can imagine all else we have
386.831	to learn about these landscapes
390.018	if we just preserve them first.
391.9	Now despite all this rich life
391.9	that abounds in these swamps,
396.455	they still have a bad name.
398.828	Many people feel uncomfortable
398.828	with the idea of wading
402.518	into Florida's blackwater.
404.206	I can understand that.
406.019	But what I loved about growing up
406.019	in the Sunshine State
409.184	is that for so many of us,
410.49	we live with this latent
410.49	but very palpable fear
414.303	that when we put our toes into the water,
416.668	there might be something much more ancient
419.674	and much more adapted than we are.
422.664	Knowing that you're not top dog
422.664	is a welcomed discomfort, I think.
428.082	How often in this modern
428.082	and urban and digital age
431.992	do you actually get the chance
431.992	to feel vulnerable,
435.66	or consider that the world may not
435.66	have been made for just us?
439.85	So for the last decade,
441.156	I began seeking out these areas
441.156	where the concrete yields to forest
444.575	and the pines turn to cypress,
446.777	and I viewed all these
446.777	mosquitoes and reptiles,
450.446	all these discomforts,
451.969	as affirmations that I'd found
451.969	true wilderness,
455.525	and I embrace them wholly.
457.709	Now as a conservation photographer
457.709	obsessed with blackwater,
461.136	it's only fitting that I'd
461.136	eventually end up
463.28	in the most famous swamp of all:
465.481	the Everglades.
467.144	Growing up here in North Central Florida,
469.137	it always had these enchanted names,
470.891	places like Loxahatchee and Fakahatchee,
474.257	Corkscrew, Big Cypress.
476.403	I started what turned
476.403	into a five-year project
479.967	to hopefully reintroduce
479.967	the Everglades in a new light,
483.741	in a more inspired light.
485.922	But I knew this would be a tall order,
485.922	because here you have an area
489.171	that's roughly a third the size
489.171	the state of Florida, it's huge.
492.224	And when I say Everglades,
493.525	most people are like,
493.525	"""Oh, yeah, the national park."""
496.017	But the Everglades is not just a park;
496.017	it's an entire watershed,
501.054	starting with the Kissimmee
501.054	chain of lakes in the north,
504.083	and then as the rains
504.083	would fall in the summer,
506.332	these downpours would flow
506.332	into Lake Okeechobee,
508.988	and Lake Okeechobee would fill up
508.988	and it would overflow its banks
512.259	and spill southward, ever slowly,
512.259	with the topography,
515.557	and get into the river of grass,
515.557	the Sawgrass Prairies,
518.177	before meting into the cypress slews,
520.246	until going further south
520.246	into the mangrove swamps,
522.957	and then finally -- finally --
522.957	reaching Florida Bay,
526.731	the emerald gem of the Everglades,
528.528	the great estuary,
529.735	the 850 square-mile estuary.
532.464	So sure, the national park
532.464	is the southern end of this system,
536.821	but all the things that make it unique
536.821	are these inputs that come in,
540.148	the fresh water that starts
542.979	So no manner of these political
542.979	or invisible boundaries
546.268	protect the park from polluted water
546.268	or insufficient water.
551.242	And unfortunately, that's precisely
551.242	what we've done.
554.63	Over the last 60 years,
556.187	we have drained, we have dammed,
556.187	we have dredged the Everglades
559.568	to where now only one third of the water
559.568	that used to reach the bay
563.573	now reaches the bay today.
566.586	So this story is not all sunshine
566.586	and rainbows, unfortunately.
570.953	For better or for worse,
572.863	the story of the Everglades
572.863	is intrinsically tied
576.304	to the peaks and the valleys
576.304	of mankind's relationship
579.524	with the natural world.
581.255	But I'll show you
581.255	these beautiful pictures,
583.304	because it gets you on board.
584.789	And while I have your attention,
584.789	I can tell you the real story.
587.941	It's that we're taking this,
589.916	and we're trading it for this,
592.903	at an alarming rate.
595.358	And what's lost on so many people
597.092	is the sheer scale
597.092	of which we're discussing.
599.627	Because the Everglades is not just
599.627	responsible for the drinking water
603.079	for 7 million Floridians;
605.307	today it also provides
605.307	the agricultural fields
607.869	for the year-round tomatoes and oranges
610.452	for over 300 million Americans.
614.391	And it's that same seasonal pulse
614.391	of water in the summer
617.729	that built the river of grass
617.729	6,000 years ago.
622.284	Ironically, today, it's also responsible
622.284	for the over half a million acres
626.686	of the endless river of sugarcane.
629.899	These are the same fields
629.899	that are responsible
632.092	for dumping exceedingly high levels
632.092	of fertilizers into the watershed,
636.14	forever changing the system.
638.749	But in order for you to not just
638.749	understand how this system works,
641.985	but to also get personally
641.985	connected to it,
644.072	I decided to break the story down
644.072	into several different narratives.
647.371	And I wanted that story to start
647.371	in Lake Okeechobee,
650.183	the beating heart of the Everglade system.
652.954	And to do that, I picked an ambassador,
655.441	an iconic species.
657.204	This is the Everglade snail kite.
659.72	It's a great bird,
660.99	and they used to nest in the thousands,
662.888	thousands in the northern Everglades.
664.715	And then they've gone down
664.715	to about 400 nesting pairs today.
668.243	And why is that?
669.612	Well, it's because they eat
669.612	one source of food, an apple snail,
672.76	about the size of a ping-pong ball,
672.76	an aquatic gastropod.
676.185	So as we started damming up
676.185	the Everglades,
679.434	as we started diking Lake Okeechobee
679.434	and draining the wetlands,
682.935	we lost the habitat for the snail.
685.071	And thus, the population
685.071	of the kites declined.
688.454	And so, I wanted a photo that would
688.454	not only communicate this relationship
691.974	between wetland, snail and bird,
695.087	but I also wanted a photo
695.087	that would communicate
697.36	how incredible this relationship was,
700.178	and how very important it is
700.178	that they've come to depend on each other,
704.358	this healthy wetland and this bird.
706.049	And to do that, I brainstormed this idea.
708.045	I started sketching
708.045	out these plans to make a photo,
711.307	and I sent it to the wildlife biologist
711.307	down in Okeechobee --
714.218	this is an endangered bird,
714.218	so it takes special permission to do.
717.329	So I built this submerged platform
719.047	that would hold snails
719.047	just right under the water.
721.553	And I spent months planning
721.553	this crazy idea.
726.035	And I took this platform
726.035	down to Lake Okeechobee
729.035	and I spent over a week in the water,
731.131	wading waist-deep,
731.131	9-hour shifts from dawn until dusk,
734.871	to get one image that I thought
734.871	might communicate this.
738.055	And here's the day that it finally worked:
740.294	[Video: (Mac Stone narrating)
740.294	After setting up the platform,
743.175	I look off and I see a kite
743.175	coming over the cattails.
745.736	And I see him scanning and searching.
747.682	And he gets right over the trap,
749.311	and I see that he's seen it.
750.856	And he beelines,
750.856	he goes straight for the trap.
753.603	And in that moment,
753.603	all those months of planning, waiting,
756.783	all the sunburn, mosquito bites --
758.917	suddenly, they're all worth it.
761.479	(Mac Stone in film) Oh my gosh,
761.479	I can't believe it!]
765.695	You can believe how excited I was
765.695	when that happened.
768.316	But what the idea was,
769.68	is that for someone
769.68	who's never seen this bird
771.903	and has no reason to care about it,
773.997	these photos, these new perspectives,
776.646	will help shed a little new light
776.646	on just one species
779.792	that makes this watershed
779.792	so incredible, so valuable, so important.
784.615	Now, I know I can't come
784.615	here to Gainesville
787.562	and talk to you about animals
787.562	in the Everglades
789.832	without talking about gators.
791.644	I love gators, I grew up loving gators.
794.361	My parents always said I had
794.361	an unhealthy relationship with gators.
797.801	But what I like about them is,
799.293	they're like the freshwater
799.293	equivalent of sharks.
801.921	They're feared, they're hated,
803.593	and they are tragically misunderstood.
806.386	Because these are a unique species,
806.386	they're not just apex predators.
810.174	In the Everglades,
811.488	they are the very architects
811.488	of the Everglades,
814.006	because as the water drops
814.006	down in the winter
816.173	during the dry season,
817.355	they start excavating these holes
817.355	called gator holes.
820.401	And they do this because
820.401	as the water drops down,
822.735	they'll be able to stay wet
822.735	and they'll be able to forage.
826.645	And now this isn't just affecting them,
828.988	other animals also depend
828.988	on this relationship,
831.245	so they become a keystone species as well.
834.677	So how do you make an apex predator,
834.677	an ancient reptile,
838.936	at once look like it dominates the system,
841.438	but at the same time, look vulnerable?
844.706	Well, you wade into a pit
844.706	of about 120 of them,
848.773	then you hope that you've made
848.773	the right decision.
851.203	(Laughter)
853.955	I still have all my fingers, it's cool.
856.677	But I understand, I know
856.677	I'm not going to rally you guys,
859.403	I'm not going to rally the troops to
859.403	"""Save the Everglades for the gators!"""
863.037	It won't happen because
863.037	they're so ubiquitous,
865.259	we see them now,
866.434	they're one of the great conservation
866.434	success stories of the US.
869.8	But there is one species in the Everglades
869.8	that no matter who you are,
873.15	you can't help but love, too,
873.15	and that's the roseate spoonbill.
876.253	These birds are great, but they've had
876.253	a really tough time in the Everglades,
879.908	because they started out with thousands
879.908	of nesting pairs in Florida Bay,
883.398	and at the turn of the 20th century,
885.485	they got down to two -- two nesting pairs.
889.101	And why?
890.681	That's because women thought
890.681	they looked better on their hats
893.601	then they did flying in the sky.
896.324	Then we banned the plume trade,
898.757	and their numbers started rebounding.
900.899	And as their numbers started rebounding,
902.948	scientists began to pay attention,
904.711	they started studying these birds.
906.448	And what they found out is that
907.957	these birds' behavior
907.957	is intrinsically tied
910.139	to the annual draw-down
910.139	cycle of water in the Everglades,
913.081	the thing that defines
913.081	the Everglades watershed.
916.291	What they found out is that
917.852	these birds started nesting in the winter
917.852	as the water drew down,
920.944	because they're tactile feeders,
920.944	so they have to touch whatever they eat.
924.548	And so they wait for these
924.548	concentrated pools of fish
927.67	to be able to feed enough
927.67	to feed their young.
930.877	So these birds became the very icon
930.877	of the Everglades --
933.89	an indicator species
933.89	of the overall health of the system.
937.406	And just as their numbers were rebounding
937.406	in the mid-20th century --
940.637	shooting up to 900, 1,000, 1,100, 1,200 --
945.31	just as that started happening, we started
945.31	draining the southern Everglades.
949.09	And we stopped two-thirds
949.09	of that water from moving south.
952.618	And it had drastic consequences.
955.584	And just as those numbers
955.584	started reaching their peak,
958.222	unfortunately, today,
958.222	the real spoonbill story,
961.319	the real photo of what it looks like
961.319	is more something like this.
967.007	And we're down to less than 70
967.007	nesting pairs in Florida Bay today,
971.647	because we've disrupted
971.647	the system so much.
974.215	So all these different organizations
974.215	are shouting, they're screaming,
977.49	"""The Everglades is fragile! It's fragile!"""
979.529	It is not.
980.704	It is resilient.
982.278	Because despite all we've taken,
982.278	despite all we've done and we've drained
985.794	and we've dammed and we've dredged it,
987.657	pieces of it are still here,
987.657	waiting to be put back together.
990.577	And this is what I've loved
990.577	about South Florida,
992.855	that in one place, you have
992.855	this unstoppable force of mankind
996.653	meeting the immovable object
996.653	of tropical nature.
1000.973	And it's at this new frontier
1000.973	that we are forced with a new appraisal.
1004.837	What is wilderness worth?
1007.119	What is the value of biodiversity,
1007.119	or our drinking water?
1011.195	And fortunately, after decades of debate,
1013.652	we're finally starting to act
1013.652	on those questions.
1016.643	We're slowly undertaking these projects
1019.024	to bring more freshwater back to the bay.
1021.544	But it's up to us as citizens,
1021.544	as residents, as stewards
1025.223	to hold our elected officials
1025.223	to their promises.
1029.154	What can you do to help?
1031.011	It's so easy.
1032.29	Just get outside, get out there.
1034.282	Take your friends out, take your kids out,
1036.337	take your family out.
1037.936	Hire a fishing guide.
1039.622	Show the state that protecting wilderness
1041.629	not only makes ecological sense,
1041.629	but economic sense as well.
1046.288	It's a lot of fun, just do it --
1046.288	put your feet in the water.
1049.639	The swamp will change you, I promise.
1053.351	Over the years, we've been so generous
1055.247	with these other landscapes
1055.247	around the country,
1058.341	cloaking them with this American pride,
1061.186	places that we now consider to define us:
1063.581	Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Yellowstone.
1066.73	And we use these parks
1066.73	and these natural areas
1069.163	as beacons and as cultural compasses.
1073.184	And sadly, the Everglades is very commonly
1075.253	left out of that conversation.
1077.6	But I believe it's every bit
1077.6	as iconic and emblematic
1080.132	of who we are as a country
1082.029	as any of these other wildernesses.
1084.554	It's just a different kind of wild.
1088.057	But I'm encouraged,
1089.408	because maybe we're finally
1089.408	starting to come around,
1092.126	because what was once deemed
1092.126	this swampy wasteland,
1094.737	today is a World Heritage site.
1097.404	It's a wetland
1097.404	of international importance.
1100.699	And we've come a long way
1100.699	in the last 60 years.
1103.526	And as the world's largest and most
1103.526	ambitious wetland restoration project,
1107.944	the international spotlight
1107.944	is on us in the Sunshine State.
1112.309	Because if we can heal this system,
1114.066	it's going to become an icon
1114.066	for wetland restoration
1117.539	all over the world.
1120.236	But it's up to us to decide which legacy
1120.236	we want to attach our flag to.
1125.508	They say that the Everglades
1125.508	is our greatest test.
1129.984	If we pass it, we get to keep the planet.
1133.565	I love that quote,
1134.992	because it's a challenge, it's a prod.
1137.049	Can we do it? Will we do it?
1138.952	We have to, we must.
1141.507	But the Everglades is not just a test.
1143.916	It's also a gift,
1145.559	and ultimately, our responsibility.
1148.959	Thank you.
1150.134	(Applause)
