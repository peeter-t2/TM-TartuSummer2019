12.18	In the last couple of years,
13.98	I have produced what I call
13.98	"""The Dead Mall Series,"""
	about dead malls.
19.02	Now, for those of you who are
19.02	not familiar with what a dead mall is,
23.46	it's basically a shopping mall
25.9	that has fallen into hard times.
29.02	So it either has few shops
29.02	and fewer shoppers,
31.82	or it's abandoned and crumbling into ruin.
37.1	No sale at Penny's.
38.34	(Laughter)
40.18	I started producing this series
42.58	in early 2015
45.46	after going through
45.46	kind of a dark period in my life
47.94	where I just didn't want
47.94	to create films anymore.
51.46	I put my camera away
53.42	and I just stopped.
56.7	So in 2015, I decided to make
56.7	a short film about the Owings Mills Mall.
63.3	Owings Mills Mall opened in 1986.
66.42	I should know because
66.42	I was there on opening day.
70.38	I was there with my family,
71.74	along with every other
71.74	family in Baltimore,
75.82	and you had to drive around
77.5	for 45 minutes
79.22	just to find a parking spot.
81.02	So if you can imagine,
82.58	that's not happening at the malls today.
85.3	My first mall job that I had as a teenager
88.66	was at a sporting goods store
88.66	called Herman's World of Sports.
93.22	Maybe you remember.
94.46	(Singing) Herman's World of Sports.
96.38	You guys remember that?
97.98	(Laughter)
98.9	Yeah, so I worked in a lady's shoe store.
104.22	I worked in a leather goods store,
106.74	and I also worked in a video store,
111.94	and not being one who was
111.94	very fond of the retail arts --
118.14	(Laughter)
121.38	I got fired from every single job.
124.26	(Laughter)
126.1	In between these low-paying retail jobs,
131.3	I did what any normal teenager did
134.06	in the 1990s.
136.74	I shoplifted.
139.9	I'm just kidding.
141.14	I hung out with my friends at the mall.
143.06	(Laughter)
144.62	"Everyone's like, ""Oh my God,"
144.62	"what kind of talk is this?"""
148.66	(Laughter)
152.9	Hanging out at the mall could be fun,
152.9	but it could be really lame, too,
156.26	like sharing a cigarette
156.26	with a 40-year-old unemployed mall rat
161.74	who has put on
161.74	black lipstick for the night
164.9	while you're on your break
164.9	from your crappy minimum wage job.
172.3	As I stand here today,
174.94	Owings Mills has been gutted
177.86	and it's ready for the wrecking ball.
182.3	The last time I was there,
182.3	it was in the evening,
184.98	and it was about three days
184.98	before they closed the mall for good.
190.54	And you kind of felt --
191.94	they never announced the mall was closing,
193.98	but you had this sort of feeling,
193.98	this ominous feeling,
196.62	that something big was going to happen,
199.42	like it was the end of the road.
201.98	It was a very creepy walk
201.98	through the mall.
205.54	Let me show you.
214.42	(Music)
238.82	So when I started producing
238.82	"""The Dead Mall Series,"""
241.26	I put the videos up onto YouTube,
243.02	and while I thought they were interesting,
245.18	frankly I didn't think others
245.18	would share the enthusiasm
249.78	for such a drab and depressing topic.
254.1	But apparently I was wrong,
255.46	because a lot of people
255.46	started to comment.
257.54	And at first the comments were like --
260.98	"basically like, ""Oh my God,"
260.98	that's the mall from my childhood.
264.34	"What happened?"""
266.3	And then I would get comments
266.3	from people who were like,
269.7	"""There's a dead mall in my town."
269.7	"You should come and film it."""
273.099	So I started to travel around
273.099	the mid-Atlantic region
277.9	filming these dead malls.
280.54	Some were open.
282.66	Some were abandoned.
284.74	It was kind of always hard
284.74	to get into the ones that were abandoned,
288.38	but I somehow always found a way in.
290.9	(Laughter)
293.3	The malls that are still open,
297.38	they always do this weird thing --
297.38	like the dead malls.
300.02	They'll have three stores left,
301.58	but they try to spruce it up
303.62	to make it appear
303.62	like things are on the up-and-up.
306.98	For example,
308.86	you'll have an empty store
310.9	and they bring the gate down.
312.7	So at Owings Mills, for example,
312.7	they put this tarp over the gate.
316.9	Right?
318.18	And it's got a stock photo
321.78	of a woman who is so happy
324.46	and she's holding a blouse,
326.1	and she's like --
327.34	(Laughter)
330.94	And then there's a guy
330.94	standing next to her, with, like,
333.62	an espresso cup, and he's like --
335.9	(Laughter)
338.7	"And it says, ""What brings you today?"""
343.06	(Laughter)
344.38	I wanted to be scared and depressed.
347.58	Thank you.
351.78	So the comments just kept pouring in
356.18	on the videos,
358.14	from all over the country,
358.14	and then all over the world.
362.82	And I started to think,
362.82	this could really be something,
365.46	but I had to get creative,
365.46	because I'm like,
367.78	how long are people going to sit and watch
367.78	me waddling through an empty mall?
373.62	(Laughter)
377.22	So the original episodes
377.22	I filmed with an iPhone.
381.5	So I'd walk through the mall
381.5	with an iPhone, and, you know.
385.78	Like that.
387.02	(Laughter)
388.5	And security -- because malls,
388.5	they don't like photography --
392.34	so the security would come up and be like,
392.34	"""Put that away,"" and I'm like, ""OK."""
396.1	So I had to get creative and sneaky,
398.46	so I started using a hidden camera
398.46	and different techniques
402.06	to get the footage that I needed,
403.7	and basically what I wanted to do
405.86	was make the video
408.1	like it was a first-person experience,
410.46	like you are sitting --
414.42	put your headphones on
414.42	watching the screen --
416.58	it's like, you're there in the video,
418.5	like a video game, basically.
422.34	I also started to use music,
424.82	collaborating with artists
424.82	who create music called vaporwave.
428.1	And vaporwave is a music genre
431.06	that emerged in the early 2010s
431.06	among internet communities.
435.06	Here's an example.
436.38	(Music)
468.66	That's by an artist named Disconscious
471.82	from an album he did
471.82	"called ""Hologram Plaza."""
474.02	So if you look that up,
474.02	you can hear more of those tunes.
477.7	Vaporwave is more than an art form.
477.7	It's like a movement.
481.54	It's nihilistic, it's angsty,
484.5	but it's somehow comforting.
486.7	The whole aesthetic is a way of dealing
486.7	with things you can't do anything about,
491.94	like no jobs, or sitting in your parents'
491.94	basement eating ramen noodles.
497.1	Vaporwave came out of this generation's
497.1	desire to express their hopelessness,
501.3	the same way that
501.3	the pre-internet generation did
505.06	sitting around in the food court.
509.1	One of my favorite malls
512.58	I've been to
514.66	is in Corpus Christi,
514.66	and it's called the Sunrise Mall.
518.46	When I was a kid,
520.3	my favorite thing to do was watch movies,
522.38	and I used to watch movies
522.38	over and over and over again.
525.34	And one of my favorite films
525.34	"was ""The Legend of Billie Jean."""
531.18	Now, for those of you who have seen
531.18	"""The Legend of Billie Jean,"""
534.22	you'll know that it's a great film.
537.58	I love it.
538.82	And Helen Slater and Christian Slater --
540.749	and if you didn't know,
540.749	they are not related.
542.9	Many people thought that they
542.9	were brother and sister. They're not.
546.1	But anyway, Sunrise Mall was used
546.1	in the film as a filming location.
549.5	The mall is exactly the same
549.5	as it was in 1984.
555.06	We're talking 32 years later.
555.06	Let me show you.
557.82	(Video) Dan Bell: And here's Billie Jean
557.82	running across the fountain,
562.34	being chased by Hubie Pyatt's friends.
566.66	And she jumps over here.
571.18	And you can see the shot right here
571.18	is what it looks like today.
577.58	It's pretty incredible.
578.86	I mean, honestly, it's exactly the same.
583.22	And there they are
583.22	falling in the fountain,
585.26	and she runs up the stairs.
586.62	This is a nice shot
586.62	of the whole thing here.
593.369	Dan Bell: I love that so much.
595.06	(Laughter)
597.26	I always think in my head,
597.26	if I owned a dead mall --
601.58	why don't they embrace their vintage look?
604.26	Put in a bar,
606.66	like, put vegan food in the food court
611.78	and invite millennials and hipsters
614.9	to come and drink and eat,
617.7	and I guarantee you within three weeks
619.66	H&amp;M and Levi's will be banging
619.66	on the door trying to get space.
623.82	I don't know why they don't do this,
625.58	but apparently,
626.98	it's only in my mind, it goes all day.
630.46	(Laughter)
633.9	Anyway, in closing --
635.14	(Laughter)
639.18	When they first asked me to do this talk,
642.46	I said,
644.46	"""Do you have the right person?"""
645.98	(Laughter)
650.9	These talks are supposed
650.9	to be kind of inspiring and --
654.14	(Laughter)
660.3	I remembered something, though.
662.26	I put my camera down
662.26	three or four years ago,
668.5	and it took going to these malls
672.3	for me to be inspired again.
675.9	And to see my audience
679.14	and people from all over the world
679.14	writing me and saying,
682.06	"""God, I love your videos,"""
684.3	is incredible.
687.02	I don't know how to even explain it,
688.82	as an artist,
690.22	how fulfilling that is.
692.14	If you would have told me a year ago
695.42	that I would be standing on this stage
698.26	talking to all of you wonderful people,
701.18	I would have never believed it.
702.7	I am humbled
704.14	and so appreciative.
705.98	Thank you very much.
707.22	(Applause)
