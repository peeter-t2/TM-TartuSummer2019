16.553	I'm a gamer, so I like to have goals.
20.386	I like special missions
20.386	and secret objectives.
24.59	So here's my special mission
24.59	for this talk:
28.281	I'm going to try to increase the life span
28.281	of every single person in this room
33.055	by seven and a half minutes.
35.654	Literally, you will live seven
35.654	and a half minutes longer
38.386	than you would have otherwise,
39.861	just because you watched this talk.
42.814	Some of you are looking
42.814	a little bit skeptical.
45.034	That's okay, because check it out --
46.774	I have math to prove that it is possible.
49.551	It won't make much sense now.
51.048	I'll explain it all later,
52.384	just pay attention
52.384	to the number at the bottom:
54.647	+7.68245837 minutes.
57.947	That will be my gift to you
57.947	if I'm successful in my mission.
61.466	Now, you have a secret mission too.
64.659	Your mission is to figure out
64.659	how you want to spend
68.194	your extra seven and a half minutes.
70.258	And I think you should do
70.258	something unusual with them,
72.83	because these are bonus minutes.
74.384	You weren't going to have them anyway.
76.376	Now, because I'm a game designer,
76.376	you might be thinking to yourself,
80.4	I know what she wants us to do
80.4	with those minutes,
82.845	she wants us to spend them playing games.
84.996	Now this is a totally
84.996	reasonable assumption,
87.482	given that I have made quite
87.482	a habit of encouraging people
90.268	to spend more time playing games.
91.914	For example, in my first TED Talk,
94.194	I did propose that we should spend
98.385	as a planet, playing video games.
100.506	Now, 21 billion hours, it's a lot of time.
103.893	It's so much time, in fact,
103.893	that the number one unsolicited comment
108.227	that I have heard from people
108.227	all over the world
110.529	since I gave that talk, is this:
113.198	Jane, games are great and all,
113.198	but on your deathbed,
116.72	are you really going to wish you spent
116.72	more time playing Angry Birds?
120.241	(Laughter)
121.265	This idea is so pervasive --
123.414	that games are a waste of time
123.414	that we will come to regret --
126.332	that I hear it literally everywhere I go.
128.505	For example, true story:
130.424	Just a few weeks ago,
131.788	this cab driver, upon finding out
131.788	that a friend and I were in town
135.138	for a game developers' conference,
137.051	turned around and said -- and I quote --
140.146	"""I hate games. Waste of life."
142.736	Imagine getting to the end of your life
142.736	"and regretting all that time."""
147.994	Now, I want to take
147.994	this problem seriously.
150.613	I want games to be
150.613	a force for good in the world.
153.168	I don't want gamers to regret
153.168	the time they spent playing,
155.968	time that I encouraged them to spend.
158.094	So I have been thinking about this
158.094	question a lot lately.
161.728	When we're on our deathbeds,
163.54	will we regret the time
163.54	we spent playing games?
167.159	Now, this may surprise you,
167.159	but it turns out
169.674	there is actually some scientific research
169.674	on this question.
172.842	It's true.
174.115	Hospice workers,
175.73	the people who take care of us
175.73	at the end of our lives,
178.665	recently issued a report
178.665	on the most frequently expressed regrets
183.466	that people say when they are
183.466	literally on their deathbeds.
187.667	And that's what I want
187.667	to share with you today --
189.985	the top five regrets of the dying.
194.07	Number one:
196.16	I wish I hadn't worked so hard.
201.058	Number two:
202.718	I wish I had stayed
202.718	in touch with my friends.
206.606	Number three:
207.761	I wish I had let myself be happier.
212.982	Number four:
214.193	I wish I'd had the courage
214.193	to express my true self.
219.084	And number five:
220.553	I wish I'd lived a life true to my dreams,
223.261	instead of what others expected of me.
227.365	Now, as far as I know, no one ever
227.365	told one of the hospice workers,
230.871	"""I wish I'd spent more"
230.871	"time playing video games,"""
233.966	but when I hear these top five
233.966	regrets of the dying,
236.57	I can't help but hear
236.57	five deep human cravings
239.386	that games actually help us fulfill.
241.41	For example, I wish
241.41	I hadn't worked so hard.
244.105	For many people, this means,
244.105	I wish I'd spent more time
246.836	with my family, with my kids
246.836	when they were growing up.
249.549	Well, we know that playing games together
249.549	has tremendous family benefits.
253.722	A recent study from Brigham
253.722	Young University School of Family Life
257.144	reported that parents who spend more time
257.144	playing video games with their kids
261.391	have much stronger
261.391	real-life relationships with them.
266.07	"""I wish I'd stayed in touch"
266.07	"with my friends."""
268.686	Hundreds of millions of people
270.154	use social games like FarmVille
270.154	or Words With Friends
273.316	to stay in daily contact
273.316	with real-life friends and family.
276.645	A recent study from
276.645	the University of Michigan
280.137	showed that these games are incredibly
280.137	powerful relationship-management tools.
286.858	They help us stay connected
286.858	with people in our social network
290.693	that we would otherwise grow distant from,
292.813	if we weren't playing games together.
295.113	"""I wish I'd let myself be happier."""
296.93	Well, here I can't help but think
296.93	of the groundbreaking clinical trials
300.335	recently conducted
300.335	at East Carolina University
303.263	that showed that online games
303.263	can outperform
306.138	pharmaceuticals for treating
306.138	clinical anxiety and depression.
310.395	Just 30 minutes of online game play a day
313.411	was enough to create
313.411	dramatic boosts in mood
316.408	and long-term increases in happiness.
320.805	"""I wish I'd had the courage"
320.805	"to express my true self."""
323.464	Well, avatars are a way
323.464	to express our true selves,
327.122	our most heroic, idealized
327.122	version of who we might become.
330.478	You can see that in this alter ego
330.478	portrait by Robbie Cooper
334.12	of a gamer with his avatar.
336.62	And Stanford University has been
336.62	doing research for five years now
340.114	to document how playing a game
340.114	with an idealized avatar
344.291	changes how we think and act in real life,
347.085	making us more courageous, more ambitious,
350.069	more committed to our goals.
353.712	"""I wish I'd led a life true to my dreams,"
355.828	"and not what others expected of me."""
357.658	Are games doing this yet?
358.964	I'm not sure, so I've left
358.964	a Super Mario question mark.
362.464	We're going to come back to this one.
364.805	But in the meantime,
364.805	perhaps you're wondering,
368.345	who is this game designer
368.345	to be talking to us
371.304	about deathbed regrets?
373.116	And it's true, I've never
373.116	worked in a hospice,
376.497	I've never been on my deathbed.
379.41	But recently I did spend
379.41	three months in bed, wanting to die.
385.616	Really wanting to die.
387.496	Now let me tell you that story.
389.877	It started two years ago, when I hit
389.877	my head and got a concussion.
393.005	The concussion didn't heal properly,
394.802	and after 30 days, I was left
394.802	with symptoms like nonstop headaches,
398.583	nausea, vertigo, memory loss, mental fog.
401.905	My doctor told me that in order
401.905	to heal my brain,
404.333	I had to rest it.
405.381	So I had to avoid everything
405.381	that triggered my symptoms.
408.038	For me that meant no reading,
408.038	no writing, no video games,
410.933	no work or email, no running,
410.933	no alcohol, no caffeine.
414.013	In other words -- and I think
414.013	you see where this is going --
417.006	no reason to live.
418.11	(Laughter)
419.135	Of course it's meant to be funny,
421	but in all seriousness,
421	suicidal ideation is quite common
424.918	with traumatic brain injuries.
426.881	It happens to one in three,
426.881	and it happened to me.
430.503	My brain started telling me,
430.503	"""Jane, you want to die."""
435.681	"It said, ""You're never going"
435.681	"to get better."""
439.057	"It said, ""The pain will never end."""
442.644	And these voices became
442.644	so persistent and so persuasive
446.826	that I started to legitimately
446.826	fear for my life,
451.959	which is the time that I said
451.959	to myself after 34 days --
456.46	and I will never forget this moment --
458.547	"I said, ""I am either going to kill myself"
461.954	"or I'm going to turn this into a game."""
464.581	Now, why a game?
465.75	I knew from researching the psychology
465.75	of games for more than a decade
469.878	that when we play a game --
471.609	and this is
471.609	in the scientific literature --
473.664	we tackle tough challenges
473.664	with more creativity,
476.457	more determination, more optimism,
478.158	and we're more likely
478.158	to reach out to others for help.
480.73	I wanted to bring these gamer traits
480.73	to my real-life challenge,
483.773	so I created a role-playing recovery game
485.793	called Jane the Concussion Slayer.
487.701	Now this became my new secret identity,
490.519	and the first thing I did as a slayer
490.519	was call my twin sister --
493.943	I have an identical
493.943	twin sister named Kelly --
496.275	"and tell her, ""I'm playing"
496.275	a game to heal my brain,
500.017	"and I want you to play with me."""
502.089	This was an easier way to ask for help.
506.147	She became my first ally in the game,
508.409	my husband Kiyash joined next,
510.369	and together we identified
510.369	and battled the bad guys.
513.787	Now this was anything
513.787	that could trigger my symptoms
516.899	and therefore slow down
516.899	the healing process,
518.987	things like bright lights
518.987	and crowded spaces.
521.359	We also collected and activated power-ups.
524.404	This was anything I could do
524.404	on even my worst day
527.365	to feel just a little bit good,
529.532	just a little bit productive.
531.46	Things like cuddling
531.46	my dog for 10 minutes,
534.177	or getting out of bed and walking
534.177	around the block just once.
537.469	Now the game was that simple:
539.233	Adopt a secret identity,
539.233	recruit your allies,
542.391	battle the bad guys,
542.391	activate the power-ups.
545.415	But even with a game so simple,
547.399	within just a couple days
547.399	of starting to play,
549.962	that fog of depression
549.962	and anxiety went away.
553.793	It just vanished. It felt like a miracle.
556.253	Now it wasn't a miracle cure
556.253	for the headaches
558.765	or the cognitive symptoms.
560.028	That lasted for more than a year,
561.769	and it was the hardest year
561.769	of my life by far.
564.959	But even when I still had the symptoms,
567.293	even while I was still in pain,
567.293	I stopped suffering.
571.983	Now what happened next
571.983	with the game surprised me.
574.459	I put up some blog posts
574.459	and videos online,
576.544	explaining how to play.
577.989	But not everybody
577.989	has a concussion, obviously,
580.544	"not everyone wants to be ""the slayer,"""
582.8	so I renamed the game SuperBetter.
585.5	And soon, I started hearing
585.5	from people all over the world
588.73	who were adopting
588.73	their own secret identity,
591.04	recruiting their own allies,
591.04	"and they were getting ""super better,"""
594.365	facing challenges
594.365	like cancer and chronic pain,
598.271	depression and Crohn's disease.
600.604	Even people were playing it
600.604	for terminal diagnoses like ALS.
604.985	And I could tell from their messages
604.985	and their videos
608.628	that the game was helping them
608.628	in the same ways that it helped me.
612.215	They talked about feeling
612.215	stronger and braver.
615.546	They talked about feeling better
615.546	understood by their friends and family.
619.776	And they even talked
619.776	about feeling happier,
622.343	even though they were in pain,
624.447	even though they were tackling
624.447	the toughest challenge of their lives.
627.838	Now at the time, I'm thinking
627.838	to myself, what is going on here?
631.723	I mean, how could a game
631.723	so trivial intervene so powerfully
636.64	in such serious, and in some cases
636.64	life-and-death, circumstances?
640.591	I mean, if it hadn't worked for me,
642.386	there's no way I would have
642.386	believed it was possible.
644.917	Well, it turns out
644.917	there's some science here, too.
648.401	Some people get stronger and happier
648.401	after a traumatic event.
653.123	And that's what was happening to us.
654.94	The game was helping us experience
657.085	what scientists call
657.085	post-traumatic growth,
660.239	which is not something
660.239	we usually hear about.
662.463	We usually hear about
662.463	post-traumatic stress disorder.
665.352	But scientists now know
665.352	that a traumatic event
667.968	doesn't doom us to suffer indefinitely.
670.858	Instead, we can use it as a springboard
673.222	to unleash our best qualities
673.222	and lead happier lives.
676.742	Here are the top five things that people
676.742	with post-traumatic growth say:
681.408	"""My priorities have changed."""
682.956	"""I'm not afraid to do"
682.956	"what makes me happy."""
685.813	"""I feel closer to my friends and family."""
689.083	"""I understand myself better."
689.083	"I know who I really am now."""
693.123	"""I have a new sense of meaning"
693.123	"and purpose in my life."""
696.674	"""I'm better able to focus"
696.674	"on my goals and dreams."""
699.714	Now, does this sound familiar?
701.833	It should, because the top five traits
701.833	of post-traumatic growth
706.089	are essentially the direct opposite
706.089	of the top five regrets of the dying.
711.603	Now this is interesting, right?
713.167	It seems that somehow, a traumatic event
715.887	can unlock our ability to lead
715.887	a life with fewer regrets.
720.051	But how does it work?
721.371	How do you get from trauma to growth?
723.916	Or better yet, is there a way
723.916	to get all the benefits
726.691	of post-traumatic growth
726.691	without the trauma,
729.212	without having to hit
729.212	your head in the first place?
731.665	That would be good, right?
733.172	I wanted to understand
733.172	the phenomenon better,
735.571	so I devoured the scientific literature,
735.571	and here's what I learned.
739.127	There are four kinds
739.127	of strength, or resilience,
742.003	that contribute to post-traumatic growth,
745.143	and there are scientifically
745.143	validated activities
747.741	that you can do every day to build up
747.741	these four kinds of resilience,
752.205	and you don't need a trauma to do it.
753.998	I could tell you what these four
753.998	types of strength are,
756.608	but I'd rather you
756.608	experience them firsthand.
758.735	I'd rather we all start building them up
758.735	together right now.
761.708	Here's what we're going to do.
763.163	We'll play a quick game together.
764.964	This is where you earn
764.964	the seven and a half minutes
767.387	of bonus life that I promised you earlier.
769.411	All you have to do
769.411	is successfully complete
772.082	the first four SuperBetter quests.
774.423	And I feel like you can do it.
774.423	I have confidence in you.
777.089	So, everybody ready?
778.473	This is your first quest. Here we go.
780.76	Pick one: Stand up and take three steps,
783.516	or make your hands into fists,
783.516	raise them over your head
786.182	as high as you can for five seconds, go!
789.964	All right, I like the people doing both.
791.973	You are overachievers. Very good.
793.602	(Laughter)
794.695	Well done, everyone.
795.742	That is worth +1 physical resilience,
797.902	which means that your body
797.902	can withstand more stress
800.648	and heal itself faster.
802.187	We know from the research
803.522	that the number one thing you can do
803.522	to boost your physical resilience
806.912	is to not sit still.
808.212	That's all it takes.
809.436	Every single second
809.436	that you are not sitting still,
812.656	you are actively improving
812.656	the health of your heart,
815.448	and your lungs and brains.
817.066	Everybody ready for your next quest?
819.44	I want you to snap
819.44	your fingers exactly 50 times,
821.757	or count backwards from 100
821.757	by seven, like this: 100, 93...
825.284	Go!
826.321	(Snapping)
829.773	Don't give up.
830.86	(Snapping)
833.675	Don't let the people
833.675	counting down from 100
835.731	interfere with your counting to 50.
837.461	(Snapping)
840.373	(Laughter)
841.946	Nice. Wow. That's the first
841.946	time I've ever seen that.
845.674	Bonus physical resilience.
845.674	Well done, everyone.
848.65	Now that's worth +1 mental resilience,
850.76	which means you have more
850.76	mental focus, more discipline,
853.451	determination and willpower.
855.301	We know from the scientific research
857.113	that willpower
857.113	actually works like a muscle.
859.264	It gets stronger the more you exercise it.
862.039	So tackling a tiny challenge
862.039	without giving up,
865.415	even one as absurd as snapping
865.415	your fingers exactly 50 times
868.797	or counting backwards from 100 by seven
870.679	is actually a scientifically validated way
870.679	to boost your willpower.
874.275	So good job. Quest number three.
876.277	Pick one: Because of the room,
876.277	fate's really determined this for you,
879.565	but here are the two options.
880.973	If you're inside,
880.973	find a window and look out of it.
883.451	If you're outside,
883.451	find a window and look in.
886.003	Or do a quick YouTube
886.003	or Google image search
888.628	"for ""baby [your favorite animal.]"""
890.424	Do it on your phones,
890.424	or just shout out some baby animals,
893.249	and I'll put them on the screen.
894.825	So, what do we want to see?
896.305	Sloth, giraffe, elephant, snake.
896.305	Okay, let's see what we got.
901.782	Baby dolphin and baby llamas.
901.782	Everybody look.
907.035	Got that?
908.277	Okay, one more. Baby elephant.
910.532	(Audience) Oh!
911.721	We're clapping for that?
913.206	That's amazing.
914.414	(Laughter)
915.53	All right, what we're just feeling there
915.53	is plus-one emotional resilience,
919.053	which means you have the ability
919.053	to provoke powerful,
921.579	positive emotions like curiosity or love,
924.061	which we feel looking at baby animals,
925.937	when you need them most.
927.188	Here's a secret from the scientific
927.188	literature for you.
929.866	If you can manage to experience
929.866	three positive emotions
933.591	for every one negative emotion
936.116	over the course of an hour, a day, a week,
939.108	you dramatically improve your health
941.204	and your ability to successfully tackle
941.204	any problem you're facing.
944.788	And this is called the three-to-one
944.788	positive emotion ratio.
948.067	It's my favorite
948.067	SuperBetter trick, so keep it up.
950.749	All right, pick one, last quest:
952.844	Shake someone's hand for six seconds,
954.7	or send someone a quick thank you
956.431	by text, email, Facebook or Twitter. Go!
958.361	(Chatting)
963.329	Looking good, looking good.
966.746	Nice, nice.
968.825	Keep it up.
970.607	I love it!
971.632	All right, everybody,
971.632	that is +1 social resilience,
975.048	which means you actually get
975.048	more strength from your friends,
978.295	your neighbors, your family,
978.295	your community.
980.416	Now, a great way to boost
980.416	social resilience is gratitude.
983.925	Touch is even better.
985.216	Here's one more secret for you:
986.767	Shaking someone's hand for six seconds
989.036	dramatically raises the level
989.036	of oxytocin in your bloodstream,
992.072	now that's the trust hormone.
993.938	That means that all of you
993.938	who just shook hands
996.187	are biochemically primed to like
996.187	and want to help each other.
999.599	This will linger during the break,
1002.151	so take advantage
1002.151	of the networking opportunities.
1004.561	(Laughter)
1005.631	Well, you have successfully
1005.631	completed your four quests,
1008.361	let's see if I've successfully
1008.361	completed my mission
1010.788	to give you seven and a half
1010.788	minutes of bonus life.
1013.197	Now I get to share one more
1013.197	little bit of science with you.
1016.022	It turns out that people who regularly
1016.022	boost these four types of resilience --
1020.206	physical, mental, emotional and social --
1022.745	live 10 years longer than everyone else.
1025.202	So this is true.
1026.288	If you are regularly achieving
1026.288	the three-to-one positive emotion ratio,
1030.095	if you are never sitting still
1030.095	for more than an hour at a time,
1033.246	if you are reaching out to one person
1033.246	you care about every single day,
1037.115	if you are tackling tiny goals
1037.115	to boost your willpower,
1041.242	you will live 10 years longer
1041.242	than everyone else,
1043.593	and here's where that math
1043.593	I showed you earlier comes in.
1046.332	So, the average life expectancy
1046.332	in the U.S. and the U.K. is 78.1 years,
1050.355	but we know from more than 1,000
1050.355	peer-reviewed scientific studies
1053.483	that you can add 10 years of life
1053.483	by boosting your four types of resilience.
1057.102	So every single year that you are boosting
1057.102	your four types of resilience,
1060.661	you're actually earning
1060.661	.128 more years of life
1062.934	or 46 more days of life,
1062.934	or 67,298 more minutes of life,
1067.507	which means every single day,
1067.507	you are earning 184 minutes of life,
1071.821	or every single hour that you are boosting
1071.821	your four types of resilience,
1075.322	like we just did together,
1075.322	you are earning 7.68245837
1078.587	more minutes of life.
1079.682	Congratulations, those seven
1079.682	and a half minutes are all yours.
1082.618	You totally earned them.
1084.118	Yeah!
1085.149	(Applause)
1086.467	Awesome.
1088.294	Wait, wait, wait.
1090.909	You still have your special mission,
1090.909	your secret mission.
1094.064	How are you going to spend
1094.064	these minutes of bonus life?
1097.128	Well, here's my suggestion.
1098.845	These seven and a half bonus minutes
1098.845	are kind of like genie's wishes.
1102.487	You can use your first wish
1102.487	to wish for a million more wishes.
1105.985	Pretty clever, right?
1107.056	So, if you spend these
1107.056	seven and a half minutes today
1110.911	doing something that makes you happy,
1113.545	or that gets you physically active,
1115.288	or puts you in touch
1115.288	with someone you care about,
1118.391	or even just tackling a tiny challenge,
1121.224	you're going to boost your resilience,
1121.224	so you're going to earn more minutes.
1124.873	And the good news is,
1124.873	you can keep going like that.
1127.352	Every hour of the day,
1127.352	every day of your life,
1129.656	all the way to your deathbed,
1131.088	which will now be 10 years later
1131.088	than it would have otherwise.
1134.341	And when you get there, more than likely,
1137.523	you will not have
1137.523	any of those top five regrets,
1141.063	because you will have built up
1141.063	the strength and resilience
1143.936	to lead a life truer to your dreams.
1147.396	And with 10 extra years,
1147.396	you might even have enough time
1150.659	to play a few more games.
1152.602	Thank you.
1153.705	(Applause)
