12.502	Technology can change our understanding of nature.
16.693	Take for example the case of lions.
19.844	For centuries, it's been said that female lions
22.014	do all of the hunting out in the open savanna,
24.743	and male lions do nothing until it's time for dinner.
28.724	You've heard this too, I can tell.
31.736	Well recently, I led an airborne mapping campaign
34.322	in the Kruger National Park in South Africa.
36.994	Our colleagues put GPS tracking collars
39.586	on male and female lions,
41.183	and we mapped their hunting behavior
42.791	from the air.
44.239	The lower left shows a lion sizing up
46.905	a herd of impala for a kill,
48.917	and the right shows what I call
50.486	the lion viewshed.
52.349	That's how far the lion can see in all directions
54.971	until his or her view is obstructed by vegetation.
59.146	And what we found
60.587	is that male lions are not the lazy hunters
63.093	we thought them to be.
64.617	They just use a different strategy.
66.754	Whereas the female lions hunt
68.506	out in the open savanna
69.638	over long distances, usually during the day,
72.299	male lions use an ambush strategy
75.309	in dense vegetation, and often at night.
79.042	This video shows the actual hunting viewsheds
82.048	of male lions on the left
83.913	and females on the right.
85.902	Red and darker colors show more dense vegetation,
88.458	and the white are wide open spaces.
90.573	And this is the viewshed right literally at the eye level
93.673	of hunting male and female lions.
96.203	All of a sudden, you get a very clear understanding
98.532	of the very spooky conditions under which
101.385	male lions do their hunting.
103.465	I bring up this example to begin,
104.961	because it emphasizes how little
104.961	we know about nature.
109.429	There's been a huge amount of work done so far
112.104	to try to slow down our losses of tropical forests,
115.732	and we are losing our forests at a rapid rate,
117.681	as shown in red on the slide.
119.595	I find it ironic that we're doing so much,
121.935	yet these areas are fairly unknown to science.
125.568	So how can we save what we don't understand?
128.225	Now I'm a global ecologist and an Earth explorer
130.887	with a background in physics and chemistry
132.578	and biology and a lot of other boring subjects,
135.782	but above all, I'm obsessed with what we don't know
138.784	about our planet.
140.496	So I created this,
142.17	the Carnegie Airborne Observatory, or CAO.
145.447	It may look like a plane with a fancy paint job,
147.504	but I packed it with over 1,000 kilos
150.264	of high-tech sensors, computers,
152.7	and a very motivated staff
154.911	of Earth scientists and pilots.
157.38	Two of our instruments are very unique:
159.24	one is called an imaging spectrometer
160.994	that can actually measure the chemical composition
162.856	of plants as we fly over them.
165.785	Another one is a set of lasers,
167.711	very high-powered lasers,
169.442	that fire out of the bottom of the plane,
171.402	sweeping across the ecosystem
173.274	and measuring it at nearly 500,000 times per second
177.371	in high-resolution 3D.
179.849	Here's an image of the Golden Gate Bridge
181.833	in San Francisco, not far from where I live.
184.005	Although we flew straight over this bridge,
185.808	we imaged it in 3D, captured its color
187.464	in just a few seconds.
189.511	But the real power of the CAO
191.606	is its ability to capture the actual building blocks
193.781	of ecosystems.
195.55	This is a small town in the Amazon,
197.249	imaged with the CAO.
198.864	We can slice through our data
200.603	and see, for example, the 3D structure
202.867	of the vegetation and the buildings,
205.2	or we can use the chemical information
207.109	to actually figure out how fast the plants are growing
209.84	as we fly over them.
211.183	The hottest pinks are the fastest-growing plants.
214.669	And we can see biodiversity in ways
216.586	that you never could have imagined.
218.745	This is what a rainforest might look like
220.296	as you fly over it in a hot air balloon.
222.503	This is how we see a rainforest,
224.597	in kaleidoscopic color that tells us
226.942	that there are many species living with one another.
229.884	But you have to remember that these trees
231.808	are literally bigger than whales,
234.104	and what that means is that
234.104	they're impossible to understand
237.016	just by walking on the ground below them.
239.991	So our imagery is 3D, it's chemical, it's biological,
244.629	and this tells us not only the species
246.387	that are living in the canopy,
248.271	but it tells us a lot of information
250.191	about the rest of the species
250.191	that occupy the rainforest.
253.767	Now I created the CAO
255.898	in order to answer questions that have proven
258.037	extremely challenging to answer
258.037	from any other vantage point,
261.389	such as from the ground, or from satellite sensors.
264.266	I want to share three of those
264.266	questions with you today.
267.503	The first questions is,
269.21	how do we manage our carbon reserves
270.939	in tropical forests?
273.695	Tropical forests contain a huge
273.695	amount of carbon in the trees,
277.254	and we need to keep that carbon in those forests
279.668	if we're going to avoid any further global warming.
283.082	Unfortunately, global carbon emissions
285.308	from deforestation
287.071	now equals the global transportation sector.
290.246	That's all ships, airplanes, trains 
290.246	and automobiles combined.
294.549	So it's understandable that policy negotiators
297.64	have been working hard to reduce deforestation,
300.128	but they're doing it on landscapes
301.999	that are hardly known to science.
304.138	If you don't know where the carbon is exactly,
306.499	in detail, how can you know what you're losing?
309.351	Basically, we need a high-tech accounting system.
313.408	With our system, we're able to see the carbon stocks
315.724	of tropical forests in utter detail.
318.522	The red shows, obviously,
318.522	closed-canopy tropical forest,
321.377	and then you see the cookie cutting,
323.395	or the cutting of the forest in yellows and greens.
327.302	It's like cutting a cake except this cake
330.125	is about whale deep.
332.324	And yet, we can zoom in and see the forest
334.292	and the trees at the same time.
336.305	And what's amazing is, even though we flew
338.507	very high above this forest,
340.784	later on in analysis, we can go in
342.687	and actually experience the treetrops,
344.907	leaf by leaf, branch by branch,
347.254	just as the other species that live in this forest
350.761	experience it along with the trees themselves.
353.578	We've been using the technology to explore
355.744	and to actually put out the first carbon geographies
358.614	in high resolution
360.228	in faraway places like the Amazon Basin
362.474	and not-so-faraway places like the United States
364.761	and Central America.
366.494	What I'm going to do is I'm going to take you
366.494	on a high-resolution, first-time tour
369.994	of the carbon landscapes of Peru and then Panama.
373.923	The colors are going to be going from red to blue.
376.685	Red is extremely high carbon stocks,
378.679	your largest cathedral forests you can imagine,
381.218	and blue are very low carbon stocks.
383.46	And let me tell you, Peru alone is an amazing place,
385.894	totally unknown in terms of its carbon geography
388.283	until today.
389.869	We can fly to this area in northern Peru
391.715	and see super high carbon stocks in red,
393.851	and the Amazon River and floodplain
395.34	cutting right through it.
397.085	We can go to an area of utter devastation
398.983	caused by deforestation in blue,
400.818	and the virus of deforestation
400.818	spreading out in orange.
404.26	We can also fly to the southern Andes
406.944	to see the tree line and see exactly how
408.794	the carbon geography ends
410.71	as we go up into the mountain system.
413.416	And we can go to the biggest swamp
413.416	in the western Amazon.
416.321	It's a watery dreamworld
417.694	"akin to Jim Cameron's ""Avatar."""
420.04	We can go to one of the smallest tropical countries,
423.344	Panama, and see also a huge range
425.701	of carbon variation,
427.263	from high in red to low in blue.
429.264	Unfortunately, most of the carbon
429.264	is lost in the lowlands,
432.196	but what you see that's left,
433.742	in terms of high carbon stocks in greens and reds,
436.475	is the stuff that's up in the mountains.
438.589	One interesting exception to this
440.947	is right in the middle of your screen.
442.563	You're seeing the buffer zone
442.563	around the Panama Canal.
445.207	That's in the reds and yellows.
447.12	The canal authorities are using force
448.86	to protect their watershed and global commerce.
451.975	This kind of carbon mapping
453.465	has transformed conservation
455.383	and resource policy development.
456.979	It's really advancing our ability to save forests
459.339	and to curb climate change.
461.714	My second question: How do we
461.714	prepare for climate change
465.145	in a place like the Amazon rainforest?
467.291	Let me tell you, I spend a lot of time
468.944	in these places, and we're seeing
468.944	the climate changing already.
472.169	Temperatures are increasing,
473.781	and what's really happening is
473.781	we're getting a lot of droughts,
476.413	recurring droughts.
478.07	The 2010 mega-drought is shown here
479.887	with red showing an area
479.887	about the size of Western Europe.
483.337	The Amazon was so dry in 2010
485.599	that even the main stem of the Amazon river itself
488.001	dried up partially, as you see in the photo
490.15	in the lower portion of the slide.
493.556	What we found is that in very remote areas,
496.726	these droughts are having a big negative impact
499.472	on tropical forests.
501.06	For example, these are all of the dead trees in red
503.78	that suffered mortality following the 2010 drought.
506.841	This area happens to be on the border
508.718	of Peru and Brazil,
510.117	totally unexplored,
511.653	almost totally unknown scientifically.
514.456	So what we think, as Earth scientists,
516.922	is species are going to have to migrate
518.881	with climate change from the east in Brazil
521.673	all the way west into the Andes
523.737	and up into the mountains
525.21	in order to minimize their
525.21	exposure to climate change.
528.746	One of the problems with this is that humans
530.754	are taking apart the western Amazon as we speak.
533.779	Look at this 100-square-kilometer gash
535.888	in the forest created by gold miners.
538.79	You see the forest in green in 3D,
541.068	and you see the effects of gold mining
542.902	down below the soil surface.
545.441	Species have nowhere to migrate
545.441	in a system like this, obviously.
549.9	If you haven't been to the Amazon, you should go.
552.552	It's an amazing experience every time,
554.59	no matter where you go.
556.133	You're going to probably see it this way, on a river.
559.529	But what happens is a lot of times
561.293	the rivers hide what's really going on
563.145	back in the forest itself.
565.91	We flew over this same river,
567.624	imaged the system in 3D.
569.464	The forest is on the left.
571.28	And then we can digitally remove the forest
573.266	and see what's going on below the canopy.
575.725	And in this case, we found gold mining activity,
578.175	all of it illegal,
579.412	set back away from the river's edge,
581.608	as you'll see in those strange pockmarks
583.512	coming up on your screen on the right.
585.539	Don't worry, we're working with the authorities
587.868	to deal with this and many, many other problems
590.319	in the region.
592.929	So in order to put together a conservation plan
595.984	for these unique, important corridors
597.724	like the western Amazon
597.724	and the Andes Amazon corridor,
600.711	we have to start making
602.875	geographically explicit plans now.
605.283	How do we do that if we don't know
605.283	the geography of biodiversity in the region,
609.258	if it's so unknown to science?
610.953	So what we've been doing is using
612.817	the laser-guided spectroscopy from the CAO
615.79	to map for the first time the biodiversity
618.014	of the Amazon rainforest.
619.593	Here you see actual data showing
619.593	different species in different colors.
623.13	Reds are one type of species, blues are another,
625.27	and greens are yet another.
627.615	And when we take this together and scale up
629.778	to the regional level,
631.662	we get a completely new geography
634.231	of biodiversity unknown prior to this work.
638.619	This tells us where the big biodiversity changes
640.767	occur from habitat to habitat,
642.781	and that's really important because it tells us
644.964	a lot about where species may migrate to
647.859	and migrate from as the climate shifts.
650.742	And this is the pivotal information that's needed
653.964	by decision makers to develop protected areas
657.472	in the context of their regional development plans.
660.891	And third and final question is,
662.788	how do we manage biodiversity on a planet
664.896	of protected ecosystems?
666.874	The example I started out
666.874	with about lions hunting,
669.625	that was a study we did
671.48	behind the fence line of a protected area
673.472	in South Africa.
675.204	And the truth is, much of Africa's nature
677.202	is going to persist into the future
679.117	in protected areas like I show in blue on the screen.
682.363	This puts incredible pressure and responsibility
684.839	on park management.
686.458	They need to do and make decisions
689.075	that will benefit all of the species
689.075	that they're protecting.
692.366	Some of their decisions have really big impacts.
695.435	For example, how much and where
697.511	to use fire as a management tool?
700.151	Or, how to deal with a large species like elephants,
703.376	which may, if their populations get too large,
705.829	have a negative impact on the ecosystem
707.876	and on other species.
709.478	And let me tell you, these types of dynamics
711.971	really play out on the landscape.
713.919	In the foreground is an area with lots of fire
716.38	and lots of elephants:
717.647	wide open savanna in blue, and just a few trees.
721.323	As we cross this fence line, now we're getting
723.504	into an area that has had protection from fire
725.828	and zero elephants:
727.685	dense vegetation, a radically different ecosystem.
731.843	And in a place like Kruger,
734.233	the soaring elephant densities
735.974	are a real problem.
737.717	I know it's a sensitive issue for many of you,
740.081	and there are no easy answers with this.
742.741	But what's good is that
742.741	the technology we've developed
745.057	and we're working with in South Africa, for example,
747.529	is allowing us to map every
747.529	single tree in the savanna,
750.885	and then through repeat flights
752.454	we're able to see which trees
754.2	are being pushed over by elephants,
756.23	in the red as you see on the screen,
756.23	and how much that's happening
759.488	in different types of landscapes in the savanna.
762.025	That's giving park managers
763.666	a very first opportunity to use
766.029	tactical management strategies
766.029	that are more nuanced
769.371	and don't lead to those extremes
769.371	that I just showed you.
774.282	So really, the way we're looking
776.905	at protected areas nowadays
778.946	is to think of it as tending to a circle of life,
781.834	where we have fire management,
783.882	elephant management, those impacts on
783.882	the structure of the ecosystem,
788.016	and then those impacts
790.006	affecting everything from insects
792.312	up to apex predators like lions.
795.112	Going forward, I plan to greatly expand
796.877	the airborne observatory.
798.605	I'm hoping to actually put the technology into orbit
800.772	so we can manage the entire planet
802.455	with technologies like this.
804.188	Until then, you're going to find me flying
806.037	in some remote place that you've never heard of.
808.54	I just want to end by saying that technology is
811.082	absolutely critical to managing our planet,
814.821	but even more important is the understanding
816.92	and wisdom to apply it.
818.652	Thank you.
820.751	(Applause)
