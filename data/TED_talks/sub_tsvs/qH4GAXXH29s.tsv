13.212	I'm not sure that every person here
15.342	is familiar with my pictures.
18.079	I want to start to show just a few pictures to you,
22.162	and after I'll speak.
57.884	I must speak to you a little bit of my history,
61.836	because we'll be speaking on this
63.783	during my speech here.
66.764	I was born in 1944 in Brazil,
69.9	in the times that Brazil was not yet a market economy.
73.655	I was born on a farm,
75.538	a farm that was more than 50 percent rainforest [still].
80.04	A marvelous place.
81.66	I lived with incredible birds, incredible animals,
85.972	I swam in our small rivers with our caimans.
90.213	It was about 35 families that lived on this farm,
93.122	and everything that we produced on this farm, we consumed.
97.404	Very few things went to the market.
99.511	Once a year, the only thing that went to the market
102.221	was the cattle that we produced,
103.941	and we made trips of about 45 days
106.71	to reach the slaughterhouse,
108.886	bringing thousands of head of cattle,
111.18	and about 20 days traveling back
113.712	to reach our farm again.
116.109	When I was 15 years old,
118.486	it was necessary for me to leave this place
121.991	and go to a town a little bit bigger -- much bigger --
125.454	where I did the second part of secondary school.
128.885	There I learned different things.
131.653	Brazil was starting to urbanize, industrialize,
134.278	and I knew the politics. I became a little bit radical,
138.693	I was a member of leftist parties,
141.535	and I became an activist.
144.641	I [went to] university to become an economist.
147.733	I [did] a master's degree in economics.
150.413	And the most important thing in my life
153.422	also happened in this time.
155.081	I met an incredible girl
157.77	who became my lifelong best friend,
161.908	and my associate in everything that I have done till now,
165.676	my wife, Lélia Wanick Salgado.
168.94	Brazil radicalized very strongly.
170.844	We fought very hard against the dictatorship,
173.756	in a moment it was necessary to us:
175.542	Either go into clandestinity with weapons in hand,
179.126	or leave Brazil. We were too young,
181.581	and our organization thought it was better for us to go out,
186.782	and we went to France,
187.746	where I did a PhD in economics,
189.765	Léila became an architect.
191.761	I worked after for an investment bank.
194.844	We made a lot of trips, financed development,
197.806	economic projects in Africa with the World Bank.
200.661	And one day photography made a total invasion in my life.
204.129	I became a photographer,
205.367	abandoned everything and became a photographer,
207.983	and I started to do the photography
210.808	that was important for me.
213.804	Many people tell me that you are a photojournalist,
215.99	that you are an anthropologist photographer,
218.566	that you are an activist photographer.
221.327	But I did much more than that.
224.327	I put photography as my life.
227.009	I lived totally inside photography
229.613	doing long term projects,
231.648	and I want to show you just a few pictures
234.158	of -- again, you'll see inside the social projects,
240.055	that I went to, I published many books
242.217	on these photographs,
245.423	but I'll just show you a few ones now.
294.949	In the '90s, from 1994 to 2000,
298.724	I photographed a story called Migrations.
301.965	It became a book. It became a show.
303.842	But during the time that I was photographing this,
306.6	I lived through a very hard moment in my life, mostly in Rwanda.
312.337	I saw in Rwanda total brutality.
316.648	I saw deaths by thousands per day.
319.813	I lost my faith in our species.
322.754	I didn't believe that it was possible for us to live any longer,
326.945	and I started to be attacked by my own Staphylococcus.
332.492	I started to have infection everywhere.
335.476	When I made love with my wife, I had no sperm that came out of me;
339.888	I had blood.
342.715	I went to see a friend's doctor in Paris,
345.596	told him that I was completely sick.
348.362	"He made a long examination, and told me, ""Sebastian,"
351.216	you are not sick, your prostate is perfect.
354.353	What happened is, you saw so many deaths that you are dying.
358.441	You must stop. Stop.
361.36	"You must stop because on the contrary, you will be dead."""
366.201	And I made the decision to stop.
369.847	I was really upset with photography,
372.14	with everything in the world,
374.161	and I made the decision to go back to where I was born.
378.001	It was a big coincidence.
379.605	It was the moment that my parents became very old.
383.016	I have seven sisters. I'm one of the only men in my family,
386.577	and they made together the decision
388.445	to transfer this land to Léila and myself.
391.145	When we received this land, this land was as dead as I was.
396.761	When I was a kid, it was more than 50 percent rainforest.
400.065	When we received the land,
401.587	it was less than half a percent rainforest,
405.362	as in all my region.
407.007	To build development, Brazilian development,
409.936	we destroyed a lot of our forest.
412.723	As you did here in the United States,
414.706	or you did in India, everywhere in this planet.
416.994	To build our development,
418.672	we come to a huge contradiction
420.755	that we destroy around us everything.
424.49	This farm that had thousands of head of cattle
428.155	had just a few hundreds,
430.322	and we didn't know how to deal with these.
432.727	And Léila came up with an incredible idea, a crazy idea.
436.627	She said, why don't you put back the rainforest that was here before?
441.274	You say that you were born in paradise.
442.78	Let's build the paradise again.
445.706	And I went to see a good friend
448.538	that was engineering forests
450.071	to prepare a project for us,
451.969	and we started. We started to plant, and this
454.15	first year we lost a lot of trees, second year less,
458.407	and slowly, slowly this dead land started to be born again.
463.468	We started to plant hundreds of thousands of trees,
466.831	only local species, only native species,
470.271	where we built an ecosystem identical to the one that was destroyed,
473.812	and the life started to come back in an incredible way.
478.12	It was necessary for us to transform our land
480.919	into a national park.
482.361	We transformed. We gave this land back to nature.
485.019	It became a national park.
486.394	We created an institution called Instituto Terra,
490.144	and we built a big environmental project to raise money everywhere.
495.123	Here in Los Angeles, in the Bay Area in San Francisco,
498.908	it became tax deductible in the United States.
501.059	We raised money in Spain, in Italy, a lot in Brazil.
504.387	We worked with a lot of companies in Brazil
506.595	that put money into this project, the government.
508.843	And the life started to come, and I had a big wish
513.027	to come back to photography, to photograph again.
516.443	And this time, my wish was not to photograph anymore
519.738	just one animal that I had photographed all my life: us.
524.321	I wished to photograph the other animals,
526.689	to photograph the landscapes,
528.681	to photograph us, but us from the beginning,
532.127	the time we lived in equilibrium with nature.
534.657	And I went. I started in the beginning of 2004,
539.21	and I finished at the end of 2011.
542.41	We created an incredible amount of pictures,
545.103	and the result -- Lélia did the design of all my books,
548.673	the design of all my shows. She is the creator of the shows.
551.737	And what we want with these pictures
554.044	is to create a discussion about what we have that is pristine on the planet
560.456	and what we must hold on this planet
562.979	if we want to live, to have some equilibrium in our life.
566.277	And I wanted to see us
568.788	when we used, yes, our instruments in stone.
574.655	We exist yet. I was last week
576.812	at the Brazilian National Indian Foundation,
579.708	and only in the Amazon we have about 110 groups
583.014	of Indians that are not contacted yet.
585.945	We must protect the forest in this sense.
588.478	And with these pictures, I hope that we can create
593.313	information, a system of information.
595.542	We tried to do a new presentation of the planet,
599.288	and I want to show you now just a few pictures
601.214	of this project, please.
719.543	Well, this — (Applause) —
721.975	Thank you. Thank you very much.
729.142	This is what we must fight hard
732.228	to hold like it is now.
734.119	But there is another part that we must together rebuild,
738.23	to build our societies, our modern family of societies,
742.247	we are at a point where we cannot go back.
744.886	But we create an incredible contradiction.
747.094	To build all this, we destroy a lot.
749.39	Our forest in Brazil, that antique forest
751.6	that was the size of California,
754.486	is destroyed today 93 percent.
757.16	Here, on the West Coast, you've destroyed your forest.
760.154	Around here, no? The redwood forests are gone.
763.391	Gone very fast, disappeared.
765.258	Coming the other day from Atlanta, here, two days ago,
767.927	I was flying over deserts
769.771	that we made, we provoked with our own hands.
772.631	India has no more trees. Spain has no more trees.
775.29	And we must rebuild these forests.
778.799	That is the essence of our life, these forests.
782.447	We need to breathe. The only factory
786.689	capable to transform CO2 into oxygen,
790.265	are the forests.
792.009	The only machine capable to capture the carbon
796.363	that we are producing, always,
799.214	even if we reduce them, everything that we do, we produce CO2,
803.379	are the trees.
804.878	I put the question -- three or four weeks ago,
809.244	we saw in the newspapers
810.933	millions of fish that die in Norway.
813.825	A lack of oxygen in the water.
816.841	I put to myself the question, if for a moment,
819.073	we will not lack oxygen for all animal species,
823.06	ours included -- that would be very complicated for us.
826.498	For the water system, the trees are essential.
830.802	I'll give you a small example that you'll understand very easily.
834.474	You happy people that have a lot of hair on your head,
838.4	if you take a shower, it takes you
841.565	two or three hours to dry your hair
845.089	if you don't use a dryer machine.
847.41	Me, one minute, it's dry. The same with the trees.
852.191	The trees are the hair of our planet.
854.893	When you have rain in a place that has no trees,
858.682	in just a few minutes, the water arrives in the stream,
862.11	brings soil, destroying our water source,
864.693	destroying the rivers,
866.6	and no humidity to retain.
868.01	When you have trees, the root system holds the water.
872.301	All the branches of the trees, the leaves that come down
875.029	create a humid area,
877.091	and they take months and months under the water, go to the rivers,
881.811	and maintain our source, maintain our rivers.
885.011	This is the most important thing,
887.015	when we imagine that we need water for every activity in life.
891.478	I want to show you now, to finish,
893.666	just a few pictures that for me
896.366	are very important in that direction.
899.305	You remember that I told you,
901.455	when I received the farm from my parents
903.558	that was my paradise, that was the farm.
906.358	Land completely destroyed, the erosion there, the land had dried.
911.868	But you can see in this picture,
914.424	we were starting to construct an educational center
918.439	that became quite a large environmental center in Brazil.
923.403	But you see a lot of small spots in this picture.
927.741	In each point of those spots, we had planted a tree.
931.318	There are thousands of trees.
932.893	Now I'll show you the pictures made exactly in the same point
936.101	two months ago.
939.807	(Applause)
948.857	I told you in the beginning that it was necessary
950.615	for us to plant about 2.5 million trees
955.415	of about 200 different species
957.854	in order to rebuild the ecosystem.
961.094	And I'll show you the last picture.
963.629	We are with two million trees in the ground now.
966.798	We are doing the sequestration
968.447	of about 100,000 tons of carbon with these trees.
972.901	My friends, it's very easy to do. We did it, no?
977.445	By an accident that happened to me,
979.757	we went back, we built an ecosystem.
983.157	We here inside the room,
985.824	I believe that we have the same concern,
989.36	and the model that we created in Brazil,
991.796	we can transplant it here.
993.141	We can apply it everywhere around the world, no?
996.164	And I believe that we can do it together.
999.112	Thank you very much.
1000.741	(Applause)
