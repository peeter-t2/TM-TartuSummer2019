16.039	Let me tell you a story.
17.895	It's my first year as a new high school science teacher,
21.999	and I'm so eager.
23.319	I'm so excited, I'm pouring myself into my lesson plans.
27.519	But I'm slowly coming to this horrifying realization
32.671	that my students just might not be learning anything.
37.703	This happens one day:
40.407	I'd just assigned my class to read this textbook chapter
43.621	about my favorite subject in all of biology:
47.079	viruses and how they attack.
50.551	And so I'm so excited to discuss this with them,
52.937	"and I come in and I say, ""Can somebody please explain"
56.401	"the main ideas and why this is so cool?"""
60.41	There's silence.
63.041	Finally, my favorite student, she looks me straight in the eye,
67.314	"and she says, ""The reading sucked."""
70.857	"And then she clarified. She said, ""You know what,"
74.385	I don't mean that it sucks. It means that I didn't understand a word of it.
78.314	"It's boring. Um, who cares, and it sucks."""
82.689	These sympathetic smiles
86.733	spread all throughout the room now,
89.138	and I realize that all of my other students are in the same boat,
93.777	that maybe they took notes or they memorized definitions from the textbook,
97.689	but not one of them really understood the main ideas.
103.092	Not one of them can tell me why this stuff is so cool,
105.825	why it's so important.
108.183	I'm totally clueless.
111.145	I have no idea what to do next.
114.409	So the only thing I can think of is say,
116.873	"""Listen. Let me tell you a story."
121.065	The main characters in the story are bacteria and viruses.
127.273	These guys are blown up a couple million times.
130.441	The real bacteria and viruses are so small
133.498	we can't see them without a microscope,
136.33	and you guys might know bacteria and viruses
138.034	because they both make us sick.
140.625	But what a lot of people don't know is that viruses
144.145	"can also make bacteria sick."""
147.025	Now, the story that I start telling my kids,
149.177	it starts out like a horror story.
153.801	Once upon a time there's this happy little bacterium.
157.164	Don't get too attached to him.
159.449	Maybe he's floating around in your stomach
163.585	or in some spoiled food somewhere,
165.393	and all of a sudden he starts to not feel so good.
169.473	Maybe he ate something bad for lunch,
171.53	and then things get really horrible,
174.377	as his skin rips apart, and he sees a virus
177.249	coming out from his insides.
179.385	And then it gets horrible
182.569	when he bursts open and an army of viruses
185.593	floods out from his insides.
188.674	If -- Ouch is right! --
191.857	If you see this, and you're a bacterium,
195.074	this is like your worst nightmare.
198.289	But if you're a virus and you see this,
200.906	you cross those little legs of yours and you think,
203.297	"""We rock."""
205.857	Because it took a lot of crafty work to infect this bacterium.
210.641	Here's what had to happen.
212.954	A virus grabbed onto a bacterium
216.073	and it slipped its DNA into it.
219.77	The next thing is, that virus DNA made stuff
222.801	that chopped up the bacteria DNA.
226.945	And now that we've gotten rid of the bacteria DNA,
229.833	the virus DNA takes control of the cell
234.04	and it tells it to start making more viruses.
238.033	Because, you see, DNA is like a blueprint
241.745	that tells living things what to make.
244.969	So this is kind of like going into a car factory
248.201	and replacing the blueprints with blueprints for killer robots.
254.257	The workers still come the next day, they do their job,
257.233	but they're following different instructions.
260.458	So replacing the bacteria DNA with virus DNA
263.753	turns the bacteria into a factory for making viruses --
269.281	that is, until it's so filled with viruses that it bursts.
273.185	But that's not the only way that viruses infect bacteria.
278.085	Some are much more crafty.
284.251	When a secret agent virus infects a bacterium,
288.097	they do a little espionage.
291.097	Here, this cloaked, secret agent virus is slipping his DNA into the bacterial cell,
298.369	but here's the kicker: It doesn't do anything harmful -- not at first.
304.102	Instead, it silently slips into the bacteria's own DNA,
309.502	and it just stays there like a terrorist sleeper cell,
314.134	waiting for instructions.
317.159	And what's interesting about this is now whenever this bacteria has babies,
323.03	the babies also have the virus DNA in them.
328.454	So now we have a whole extended bacteria family,
332.221	filled with virus sleeper cells.
336.366	They're just happily living together until a signal happens
341.005	and -- BAM! -- all of the DNA pops out.
345.037	It takes control of these cells, turns them into virus-making factories,
349.109	and they all burst,
351.085	a huge, extended bacteria family,
353.461	all dying with viruses spilling out of their guts,
356.844	the viruses taking over the bacterium.
361.834	So now you understand how viruses can attack cells.
365.813	There are two ways: On the left is what we call the lytic way,
370.181	where the viruses go right in and take over the cells.
374.451	On the [right] is the lysogenic way
377.213	that uses secret agent viruses.
380.55	So this stuff is not that hard, right?
383.317	And now all of you understand it.
385.333	But if you've graduated from high school,
387.101	I can almost guarantee you've seen this information before.
390.509	But I bet it was presented in a way
393.293	that it didn't exactly stick in your mind.
397.379	So when my students were first learning this,
400.069	why did they hate it so much?
402.989	Well, there were a couple of reasons.
404.976	First of all, I can guarantee you that their textbooks
408.321	didn't have secret agent viruses, and they didn't have horror stories.
413.563	You know, in the communication of science
416.4	there is this obsession with seriousness.
420.654	It kills me. I'm not kidding.
422.544	I used to work for an educational publisher,
424.856	and as a writer, I was always told never to use stories
428.601	or fun, engaging language,
430.44	because then my work might not be viewed
432.68	"as ""serious"" and ""scientific."""
435.968	Right? I mean, because God forbid somebody have fun
438.744	when they're learning science.
440.936	So we have this field of science that's all about slime,
445.639	and color changes. Check this out.
458.96	And then we have, of course, as any good scientist has to have,
463.912	explosions!
467.354	But if a textbook seems too much fun,
471.504	it's somehow unscientific.
475.256	Now another problem was that
479.112	the language in their textbook was truly incomprehensible.
484.752	If we want to summarize that story that I told you earlier,
487.441	we could start by saying something like,
488.76	"""These viruses make copies of themselves"
491.138	"by slipping their DNA into a bacterium."""
493.88	The way this showed up in the textbook, it looked like this:
497.321	"""Bacteriophage replication is initiated"
500.616	through the introduction of viral nucleic acid
503.683	"into a bacterium."""
506.225	That's great, perfect for 13-year-olds.
510.92	But here's the thing. There are plenty of people
513.56	in science education who would look at this and say there's no way
516.767	that we could ever give that to students,
519.712	because it contains some language that isn't completely accurate.
524.632	For example, I told you that viruses have DNA.
527.088	Well, a very tiny fraction of them don't.
530.217	They have something called RNA instead.
532.632	So a professional science writer would circle that
534.984	"and say, ""That has to go."
536.13	"We have to change it to something much more technical."""
538.28	And after a team of professional science editors
540.846	went over this really simple explanation,
544.512	they'd find fault with almost every word I've used,
549.456	and they'd have to change anything that wasn't serious enough,
551.824	and they'd have to change everything
553.592	that wasn't 100 percent perfect.
557.368	Then it would be accurate,
559.184	but it would be completely impossible to understand.
564.32	This is horrifying.
566.512	You know, I keep talking about this idea
568.504	of telling a story,
571.048	and it's like science communication has taken on this idea
576.175	of what I call the tyranny of precision,
579.152	where you can't just tell a story.
581.072	It's like science has become that horrible storyteller
586.02	that we all know, who gives us all the details nobody cares about,
589.44	"where you're like, ""Oh, I met my friend for lunch the other day,"
593.384	and she was wearing these ugly jeans.
595.32	I mean, they weren't really jeans, they were more kind of, like, leggings,
597.944	but, like, I guess they're actually kind of more like jeggings,
600.464	"like, but I think â€” "" and you're just like, ""Oh my God."
603.248	"What is the point?"""
605.842	Or even worse, science education is becoming
609.878	"like that guy who always says, ""Actually."""
613.384	"Right? You want to be like, ""Oh, dude,"
616.464	we had to get up in the middle of the night
617.864	"and drive a hundred miles in total darkness."""
621.48	"And that guy's like, ""Actually, it was 87.3 miles."""
626.068	"And you're like, ""Actually, shut up!"
628.456	"I'm just trying to tell a story."""
632.687	Because good storytelling is all about emotional connection.
638.984	We have to convince our audience
641.384	that what we're talking about matters.
644.504	But just as important is knowing
647.168	which details we should leave out
649.656	so that the main point still comes across.
653.176	I'm reminded of what the architect Mies van der Rohe said,
656.408	and I paraphrase, when he said that sometimes
659.392	you have to lie in order to tell the truth.
663.301	I think this sentiment is particularly relevant
665.944	to science education.
669.318	Now, finally,
672.04	I am often so disappointed
676.416	when people think that I'm advocating
679.272	a dumbing down of science.
681.912	That's not true at all.
683.688	I'm currently a Ph.D. student at MIT,
686.669	and I absolutely understand the importance of detailed,
691.658	specific scientific communication between experts,
696.297	but not when we're trying to teach 13-year-olds.
700.392	If a young learner thinks that all viruses have DNA,
705.688	that's not going to ruin their chances of success in science.
710.808	But if a young learner can't understand anything in science
715.171	and learns to hate it because it all sounds like this,
719.264	that will ruin their chances of success.
722.816	This needs to stop,
725.853	and I wish that the change could come from the institutions
729.163	at the top that are perpetuating these problems,
731.931	and I beg them, I beseech them to just stop it.
735.897	But I think that's unlikely.
738.416	So we are so lucky that we have resources
741.96	like the Internet, where we can circumvent these institutions
745.08	from the bottom up.
748.234	There's a growing number of online resources
751.552	that are dedicated to just explaining science
754.68	in simple, understandable ways.
757.976	I dream of a Wikipedia-like website that would explain
761.032	any scientific concept you can think of
763.784	in simple language any middle schooler can understand.
768.464	And I myself spend most of my free time
771.736	making these science videos that I put on YouTube.
775.897	I explain chemical equilibrium using analogies
778.864	to awkward middle school dances,
781.352	and I talk about fuel cells with stories
783.736	about boys and girls at a summer camp.
787.112	The feedback that I get is sometimes misspelled
790.872	and it's often written in LOLcats,
793.088	but nonetheless
795.584	it's so appreciative, so thankful
800.023	that I know this is the right way
803.577	we should be communicating science.
807.144	There's still so much work left to be done, though,
810.08	and if you're involved with science in any way
813.288	I urge you to join me.
816.152	Pick up a camera, start to write a blog, whatever,
821.208	but leave out the seriousness, leave out the jargon.
825.368	Make me laugh. Make me care.
828.984	Leave out those annoying details that nobody cares about
832.136	and just get to the point.
836.032	How should you start?
838.174	"Why don't you say, ""Listen, let me tell you a story""?"
842.448	Thank you.
844.498	(Applause)
