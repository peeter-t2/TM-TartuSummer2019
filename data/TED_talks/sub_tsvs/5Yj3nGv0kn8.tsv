12.604	Today I want to tell you
13.82	about a project being carried out
15.623	by scientists all over the world
18.31	to paint a neural portrait of the human mind.
21.598	And the central idea of this work
23.77	is that the human mind and brain
25.628	is not a single, general-purpose processor,
28.485	but a collection of highly specialized components,
31.927	each solving a different specific problem,
34.91	and yet collectively making up
37.246	who we are as human beings and thinkers.
41.602	To give you a feel for this idea,
43.078	imagine the following scenario:
45.742	You walk into your child's day care center.
47.938	As usual, there's a dozen kids there
50.175	waiting to get picked up,
51.766	but this time,
53.398	the children's faces look weirdly similar,
56.383	and you can't figure out which child is yours.
59.191	Do you need new glasses?
60.94	Are you losing your mind?
62.848	You run through a quick mental checklist.
65.3	No, you seem to be thinking clearly,
67.194	and your vision is perfectly sharp.
69.585	And everything looks normal
71.374	except the children's faces.
73.536	You can see the faces,
75.322	but they don't look distinctive,
77.03	and none of them looks familiar,
78.888	and it's only by spotting an orange hair ribbon
81.386	that you find your daughter.
83.282	This sudden loss of the ability to recognize faces
86.707	actually happens to people.
88.253	It's called prosopagnosia,
90.307	and it results from damage
91.488	to a particular part of the brain.
93.614	The striking thing about it
95.114	is that only face recognition is impaired;
97.709	everything else is just fine.
100.148	Prosopagnosia is one of many surprisingly specific
104.016	mental deficits that can happen after brain damage.
108.551	These syndromes collectively
109.914	have suggested for a long time
112.153	that the mind is divvied up into distinct components,
115.921	but the effort to discover those components
118.306	has jumped to warp speed
119.92	with the invention of brain imaging technology,
122.502	especially MRI.
125.55	So MRI enables you to see internal anatomy
128.79	at high resolution,
130.376	so I'm going to show you in a second
131.806	a set of MRI cross-sectional images
135.158	through a familiar object,
136.776	and we're going to fly through them
137.651	and you're going to try to figure out what the object is.
140.124	Here we go.
144.241	It's not that easy. It's an artichoke.
146.13	Okay, let's try another one,
147.76	starting from the bottom and going through the top.
152.812	Broccoli! It's a head of broccoli.
153.963	Isn't it beautiful? I love that.
155.627	Okay, here's another one. It's a brain, of course.
158.384	In fact, it's my brain.
159.97	We're going through slices through my head like that.
161.703	That's my nose over on the right, and now
163.461	we're going over here, right there.
166.87	So this picture's nice, if I do say so myself,
171.471	but it shows only anatomy.
173.383	The really cool advance with functional imaging
175.903	happened when scientists figured out how to make
177.475	pictures that show not just anatomy but activity,
180.87	that is, where neurons are firing.
183.305	So here's how this works.
184.821	Brains are like muscles.
185.938	When they get active,
187.501	they need increased blood flow to supply that activity,
190.475	and lucky for us, blood flow
190.475	control to the brain is local,
194.043	so if a bunch of neurons, say, right there
196.205	get active and start firing,
197.705	then blood flow increases just right there.
200.43	So functional MRI picks up
200.43	on that blood flow increase,
204.151	producing a higher MRI response
206.184	where neural activity goes up.
209.11	So to give you a concrete feel
210.81	for how a functional MRI experiment goes
213.295	and what you can learn from it
214.734	and what you can't,
216.118	let me describe one of the first studies I ever did.
219.56	We wanted to know if there was a special
219.56	part of the brain for recognizing faces,
223.698	and there was already reason to
223.698	think there might be such a thing
226.77	based on this phenomenon of prosopagnosia
228.49	that I described a moment ago,
230.613	but nobody had ever seen that part of the brain
232.891	in a normal person,
234.81	so we set out to look for it.
236.866	So I was the first subject.
238.817	I went into the scanner, I lay on my back,
241.029	I held my head as still as I could
243.612	while staring at pictures of faces like these
248.629	and objects like these
250.76	and faces and objects for hours.
255.925	So as somebody who has
255.925	pretty close to the world record
258.697	of total number of hours spent inside an MRI scanner,
262.24	I can tell you that one of the skills
263.672	that's really important for MRI research
266.335	is bladder control.
268.113	(Laughter)
269.915	When I got out of the scanner,
271.452	I did a quick analysis of the data,
273.768	looking for any parts of my brain
275.271	that produced a higher response
275.271	when I was looking at faces
278.077	than when I was looking at objects,
279.947	and here's what I saw.
282.118	Now this image looks just awful by today's standards,
285.774	but at the time I thought it was beautiful.
288.582	What it shows is that region right there,
290.532	that little blob,
291.815	it's about the size of an olive
293.562	and it's on the bottom surface of my brain
295.718	about an inch straight in from right there.
298.924	And what that part of my brain is doing
301.714	is producing a higher MRI response,
304.634	that is, higher neural activity,
306.382	when I was looking at faces
307.864	than when I was looking at objects.
310.13	So that's pretty cool,
311.49	but how do we know this isn't a fluke?
313.808	Well, the easiest way
315.228	is to just do the experiment again.
317.342	So I got back in the scanner,
318.981	I looked at more faces and I looked at more objects
321.412	and I got a similar blob,
323.601	and then I did it again
325.496	and I did it again
327.351	and again and again,
330.423	and around about then
331.47	I decided to believe it was for real.
334.411	But still, maybe this is
334.411	something weird about my brain
338.164	and no one else has one of these things in there,
340.626	so to find out, we scanned a bunch of other people
343.081	and found that pretty much everyone
345.527	has that little face-processing region
347.533	in a similar neighborhood of the brain.
350.426	So the next question was,
352.314	what does this thing really do?
353.788	Is it really specialized just for face recognition?
357.72	Well, maybe not, right?
358.96	Maybe it responds not only to faces
360.762	but to any body part.
362.871	Maybe it responds to anything human
365.24	or anything alive
367.02	or anything round.
368.676	The only way to be really sure that that region
370.83	is specialized for face recognition
373.247	is to rule out all of those hypotheses.
375.89	So we spent much of the next couple of years
378.72	scanning subjects while they looked at lots
380.367	of different kinds of images,
381.973	and we showed that that part of the brain
383.93	responds strongly when you look at
385.88	any images that are faces of any kind,
389.333	and it responds much less strongly
391.246	to any image you show that isn't a face,
394.395	like some of these.
395.7	So have we finally nailed the case
397.939	that this region is necessary for face recognition?
401.179	No, we haven't.
402.502	Brain imaging can never tell you
404.453	if a region is necessary for anything.
406.893	All you can do with brain imaging
408.333	is watch regions turn on and off
410.381	as people think different thoughts.
412.349	To tell if a part of the brain is
412.349	necessary for a mental function,
415.96	you need to mess with it and see what happens,
418.469	and normally we don't get to do that.
420.744	But an amazing opportunity came about
423.328	very recently when a couple of colleagues of mine
425.792	tested this man who has epilepsy
428.863	and who is shown here in his hospital bed
431.545	where he's just had electrodes placed
432.912	on the surface of his brain
434.983	to identify the source of his seizures.
437.537	So it turned out by total chance
440.07	that two of the electrodes
442.019	happened to be right on top of his face area.
445.242	So with the patient's consent,
447.571	the doctors asked him what happened
450.158	when they electrically stimulated
450.158	that part of his brain.
454.324	Now, the patient doesn't know
455.978	where those electrodes are,
457.362	and he's never heard of the face area.
459.574	So let's watch what happens.
461.565	It's going to start with a control condition
463.534	"that will say ""Sham"" nearly invisibly"
465.941	in red in the lower left,
467.651	when no current is delivered,
469.933	and you'll hear the neurologist speaking
469.933	to the patient first. So let's watch.
473.748	(Video) Neurologist: Okay, just look at my face
475.829	and tell me what happens when I do this.
479.114	All right?
480.048	Patient: Okay.
482.871	Neurologist: One, two, three.
487.191	Patient: Nothing.
487.191	Neurologist: Nothing? Okay.
490.206	I'm going to do it one more time.
492.613	Look at my face.
495.807	One, two, three.
500.307	Patient: You just turned into somebody else.
503.131	Your face metamorphosed.
505.268	Your nose got saggy, it went to the left.
508.279	You almost looked like somebody I'd seen before,
511.815	but somebody different.
514.449	That was a trip.
516.521	(Laughter)
519.653	Nancy Kanwisher: So this experiment —
521.268	(Applause) —
525.491	this experiment finally nails the case
528.173	that this region of the brain is not only
529.998	selectively responsive to faces
532.135	but causally involved in face perception.
535.18	So I went through all of these details
537.31	about the face region to show you what it takes
539.774	to really establish that a part of the brain
542.113	is selectively involved in a specific mental process.
545.241	Next, I'll go through much more quickly
547.4	some of the other specialized regions of the brain
550.06	that we and others have found.
552.16	So to do this, I've spent a lot of time
554.274	in the scanner over the last month
556.141	so I can show you these things in my brain.
558.402	So let's get started. Here's my right hemisphere.
561.635	So we're oriented like that.
561.635	You're looking at my head this way.
564.297	Imagine taking the skull off
565.39	and looking at the surface of the brain like that.
567.658	Okay, now as you can see,
569.416	the surface of the brain is all folded up.
570.919	So that's not good. Stuff could be hidden in there.
572.64	We want to see the whole thing,
574.074	so let's inflate it so we can see the whole thing.
577.386	Next, let's find that face area I've been talking about
580.215	that responds to images like these.
582.442	To see that, let's turn the brain around
583.961	and look on the inside surface on the bottom,
585.98	and there it is, that's my face area.
588.285	Just to the right of that is another region
590.992	that is shown in purple
592.63	that responds when you process color information,
595.702	and near those regions are other regions
598.393	that are involved in perceiving places,
600.756	like right now, I'm seeing
600.756	this layout of space around me
603.594	and these regions in green right there
605.346	are really active.
606.62	There's another one out on the outside surface again
608.99	where there's a couple more face regions as well.
611.795	Also in this vicinity
614.14	is a region that's selectively involved
615.785	in processing visual motion,
617.721	like these moving dots here,
619.225	and that's in yellow at the bottom of the brain,
621.914	and near that is a region that responds
625.082	when you look at images of bodies and body parts
627.979	like these, and that region is shown in lime green
630.724	at the bottom of the brain.
632.727	Now all these regions I've shown you so far
635.359	are involved in specific aspects of visual perception.
639.791	Do we also have specialized brain regions
641.939	for other senses, like hearing?
644.752	Yes, we do. So if we turn the brain around a little bit,
647.789	here's a region in dark blue
650.19	that we reported just a couple of months ago,
652.536	and this region responds strongly
654.17	when you hear sounds with pitch, like these.
657.599	(Sirens)
659.742	(Cello music)
661.823	(Doorbell)
663.74	In contrast, that same region
663.74	does not respond strongly
667.348	when you hear perfectly familiar sounds
668.91	that don't have a clear pitch, like these.
671.272	(Chomping)
673.741	(Drum roll)
675.941	(Toilet flushing)
678.708	Okay. Next to the pitch region
681.206	is another set of regions that
681.206	are selectively responsive
683.68	when you hear the sounds of speech.
686.445	Okay, now let's look at these same regions.
688.285	In my left hemisphere, there's a similar arrangement —
690.753	not identical, but similar —
692.226	and most of the same regions are in here,
694.435	albeit sometimes different in size.
696.437	Now, everything I've shown you so far
698.451	are regions that are involved in
698.451	different aspects of perception,
701.477	vision and hearing.
703.31	Do we also have specialized brain regions
704.97	for really fancy, complicated mental processes?
708.405	Yes, we do.
709.834	So here in pink are my language regions.
713.223	So it's been known for a very long time
714.651	that that general vicinity of the brain
716.686	is involved in processing language,
718.879	but we showed very recently
720.611	that these pink regions
722.321	respond extremely selectively.
724.526	They respond when you understand
724.526	the meaning of a sentence,
727.338	but not when you do other complex mental things,
730.176	like mental arithmetic
732.355	or holding information in memory
734.751	or appreciating the complex structure
737.406	in a piece of music.
741.664	The most amazing region that's been found yet
744.553	is this one right here in turquoise.
747.86	This region responds
750.05	when you think about what another person is thinking.
754.318	So that may seem crazy,
755.962	but actually, we humans do this all the time.
759.83	You're doing this when you realize
762.023	that your partner is going to be worried
763.654	if you don't call home to say you're running late.
766.161	I'm doing this with that region of my brain right now
769.63	when I realize that you guys
771.911	are probably now wondering about
773.509	all that gray, uncharted territory in the brain,
776.056	and what's up with that?
778.02	Well, I'm wondering about that too,
779.705	and we're running a bunch of
779.705	experiments in my lab right now
782.1	to try to find a number of other
784.113	possible specializations in the brain
786.145	for other very specific mental functions.
789.513	But importantly, I don't think we have
792.134	specializations in the brain
793.698	for every important mental function,
796.444	even mental functions that may be critical for survival.
799.853	In fact, a few years ago,
801.955	there was a scientist in my lab
803.072	who became quite convinced
804.481	that he'd found a brain region
806.23	for detecting food,
808.142	and it responded really strongly in the scanner
810.06	when people looked at images like this.
812.788	And further, he found a similar response
815.7	in more or less the same location
817.639	in 10 out of 12 subjects.
819.64	So he was pretty stoked,
821.934	and he was running around the lab
823.194	"telling everyone that he was going to go on ""Oprah"""
825.196	with his big discovery.
827.214	But then he devised the critical test:
830.236	He showed subjects images of food like this
833.419	and compared them to images with very similar
836.16	color and shape, but that weren't food, like these.
839.97	And his region responded the same
842.101	to both sets of images.
844.05	So it wasn't a food area,
845.377	it was just a region that liked colors and shapes.
848.148	"So much for ""Oprah."""
852.483	But then the question, of course, is,
854.708	how do we process all this other stuff
856.834	that we don't have specialized brain regions for?
859.804	Well, I think the answer is that in addition
861.615	to these highly specialized components
861.615	that I've been describing,
865.169	we also have a lot of very general-
865.169	purpose machinery in our heads
868.848	that enables us to tackle
870.342	whatever problem comes along.
872.448	In fact, we've shown recently that
874.503	these regions here in white
876.571	respond whenever you do any difficult mental task
879.982	at all —
881.083	well, of the seven that we've tested.
884.654	So each of the brain regions that I've described
886.823	to you today
888.129	is present in approximately the same location
890.896	in every normal subject.
892.638	I could take any of you,
894.261	pop you in the scanner,
895.487	and find each of those regions in your brain,
897.772	and it would look a lot like my brain,
899.677	although the regions would be slightly different
901.747	in their exact location and in their size.
905.311	What's important to me about this work
907.676	is not the particular locations of these brain regions,
910.645	but the simple fact that we have
913.232	selective, specific components of mind and brain
915.8	in the first place.
917.448	I mean, it could have been otherwise.
919.459	The brain could have been a single,
921.9	general-purpose processor,
923.395	more like a kitchen knife
924.867	than a Swiss Army knife.
926.55	Instead, what brain imaging has delivered
929.661	is this rich and interesting picture of the human mind.
933.507	So we have this picture of very general-purpose
935.97	machinery in our heads
937.04	in addition to this surprising array
939.397	of very specialized components.
943.712	It's early days in this enterprise.
945.865	We've painted only the first brushstrokes
948.641	in our neural portrait of the human mind.
951.568	The most fundamental questions remain unanswered.
954.65	So for example, what does each
954.65	of these regions do exactly?
958.45	Why do we need three face areas
960.592	and three place areas,
962.057	and what's the division of labor between them?
964.925	Second, how are all these things
967.618	connected in the brain?
969.33	With diffusion imaging,
970.917	you can trace bundles of neurons
973.096	that connect to different parts of the brain,
975.671	and with this method shown here,
977.302	you can trace the connections of
977.302	individual neurons in the brain,
980.999	potentially someday giving us a wiring diagram
983.717	of the entire human brain.
985.783	Third, how does all of this
987.83	very systematic structure get built,
990.979	both over development in childhood
993.935	and over the evolution of our species?
996.747	To address questions like that,
998.647	scientists are now scanning
1000.43	other species of animals,
1002.587	and they're also scanning human infants.
1008.931	Many people justify the high
1008.931	cost of neuroscience research
1012.582	by pointing out that it may help us someday
1015.336	to treat brain disorders like Alzheimer's and autism.
1018.793	That's a hugely important goal,
1020.74	and I'd be thrilled if any of my work contributed to it,
1023.961	but fixing things that are broken in the world
1026.959	is not the only thing that's worth doing.
1029.76	The effort to understand the human mind and brain
1032.988	is worthwhile even if it never led to the treatment
1035.806	of a single disease.
1037.483	What could be more thrilling
1039.52	than to understand the fundamental mechanisms
1042.661	that underlie human experience,
1044.957	to understand, in essence, who we are?
1047.883	This is, I think, the greatest scientific quest
1051.332	of all time.
