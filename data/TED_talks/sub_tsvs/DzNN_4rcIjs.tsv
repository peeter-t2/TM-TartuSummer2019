13.111	Imagine that you're a pig farmer.
16.232	You live on a small farm
16.232	in the Philippines.
19.101	Your animals are your family's
19.101	sole source of income --
22.784	as long as they're healthy.
24.709	You know that any day,
26.103	one of your pigs can catch the flu,
28.347	the swine flu.
29.718	Living in tight quarters,
29.718	one pig coughing and sneezing
33.013	may soon lead to the next pig
33.013	coughing and sneezing,
35.977	until an outbreak of swine flu
35.977	has taken over your farm.
39.841	If it's a bad enough virus,
41.554	the health of your herd may be gone
41.554	in the blink of an eye.
45.256	If you called in a veterinarian,
46.924	he or she would visit your farm
46.924	and take samples
49.431	from your pigs' noses and mouths.
51.279	But then they would have to drive
51.279	back into the city
54.13	to test those samples
54.13	in their central lab.
57.556	Two weeks later,
57.556	you'd hear back the results.
60.601	Two weeks may be just enough time
60.601	for infection to spread
64.711	and take away your way of life.
67.616	But it doesn't have to be that way.
69.411	Today, farmers can take
69.411	those samples themselves.
72.692	They can jump right into the pen
72.692	and swab their pigs' noses and mouths
76.463	with a little filter paper,
78.288	place that little filter paper
78.288	in a tiny tube,
81.525	and mix it with some chemicals
81.525	that will extract genetic material
85.43	from their pigs' noses and mouths.
87.367	And without leaving their farms,
89.316	they take a drop of that genetic material
91.638	and put it into a little analyzer
91.638	smaller than a shoebox,
95.872	program it to detect DNA or RNA
95.872	from the swine flu virus,
100.497	and within one hour get back the results,
100.497	visualize the results.
105.247	This reality is possible
107.227	because today we're living in the era
107.227	of personal DNA technology.
111.172	Every one of us can actually
111.172	test DNA ourselves.
115.448	DNA is the fundamental molecule
115.448	the carries genetic instructions
119.211	that help build the living world.
122.052	Humans have DNA.
123.814	Pigs have DNA.
125.41	Even bacteria and some
125.41	viruses have DNA too.
128.928	The genetic instructions encoded in DNA
128.928	inform how our bodies develop,
133.176	grow, function.
134.908	And in many cases, that same information
134.908	can trigger disease.
138.915	Your genetic information
140.71	is strung into a long and twisted
140.71	molecule, the DNA double helix,
144.424	that has over three billion letters,
146.896	beginning to end.
148.484	But the lines that carry
148.484	meaningful information
151.728	are usually very short --
153.317	a few dozen to several
153.317	thousand letters long.
156.363	So when we're looking to answer
156.363	a question based on DNA,
159.534	we actually don't need to read
161.491	all those three billion
161.491	letters, typically.
163.984	That would be like getting hungry at night
166.245	and having to flip through
166.245	the whole phone book
168.659	from cover to cover,
169.938	pausing at every line,
171.537	just to find the nearest pizza joint.
173.546	(Laughter)
174.722	Luckily, three decades ago,
177.283	humans started to invent tools
179.235	that can find any specific line
179.235	of genetic information.
182.766	These DNA machines are wonderful.
184.979	They can find any line in DNA.
187.732	But once they find it,
189.06	that DNA is still tiny, and surrounded
189.06	by so much other DNA,
194.535	that what these machines then do
194.535	is copy the target gene,
199.201	and one copy piles on top of another,
201.466	millions and millions
201.466	and millions of copies,
203.655	until that gene stands out
203.655	against the rest;
206.665	until we can visualize it,
208.872	interpret it, read it, understand it,
211.439	until we can answer:
212.741	Does my pig have the flu?
215.914	Or other questions buried in our own DNA:
219.435	Am I at risk of cancer?
222.505	Am I of Irish descent?
224.623	Is that child my son?
227.672	(Laughter)
230.537	This ability to make copies of DNA,
230.537	as simple as it sounds,
235.235	has transformed our world.
236.55	Scientists use it every day
236.55	to detect and address disease,
241.586	to create innovative medicines,
244.098	to modify foods,
246.158	to assess whether our food is safe to eat
248.158	or whether it's contaminated
248.158	with deadly bacteria.
251.578	Even judges use the output
251.578	of these machines in court
254.446	to decide whether someone is innocent
254.446	or guilty based on DNA evidence.
259.044	The inventor of this DNA-copying technique
261.481	was awarded the Nobel Prize
261.481	in Chemistry in 1993.
265.831	But for 30 years,
267.007	the power of genetic analysis
267.007	has been confined to the ivory tower,
270.864	or bigwig PhD scientist work.
274.333	Well, several companies around the world
276.459	are working on making
276.459	this same technology accessible
280.331	to everyday people like the pig farmer,
283.386	like you.
284.759	I cofounded one of these companies.
287.367	Three years ago,
288.542	together with a fellow biologist
288.542	and friend of mine,
291.553	Zeke Alvarez Saavedra,
293.157	we decided to make personal DNA machines
295.796	that anyone could use.
297.957	Our goal was to bring DNA science
297.957	to more people in new places.
301.892	We started working in our basements.
304.077	We had a simple question:
306.154	What could the world look like
307.929	if everyone could analyze DNA?
310.38	We were curious,
312.142	as curious as you would have been
312.142	if I had shown you this picture in 1980.
317.092	(Laughter)
318.401	"You would have thought, ""Wow!"
320.216	I can now call
320.216	my Aunt Glenda from the car
322.843	and wish her a happy birthday.
324.753	I can call anyone, anytime.
327.055	"This is the future!"""
329.801	Little did you know,
331.281	you would tap on that phone
331.281	to make dinner reservations
333.91	for you and Aunt Glenda
333.91	to celebrate together.
336.358	With another tap,
336.358	you'd be ordering her gift.
338.912	And yet one more tap,
340.418	"and you'd be ""liking"""
340.418	Auntie Glenda on Facebook.
342.754	And all of this,
342.754	while sitting on the toilet.
345.122	(Laughter)
347.32	It is notoriously hard to predict
347.32	where new technology might take us.
352.607	And the same is true
352.607	for personal DNA technology today.
357.04	For example, I could never have imagined
360.133	that a truffle farmer, of all people,
362.678	would use personal DNA machines.
365.267	Dr. Paul Thomas grows
365.267	truffles for a living.
368.582	We see him pictured here,
370.313	holding the first UK-cultivated truffle
370.313	in his hands, on one of his farms.
376.179	Truffles are this delicacy
377.699	that stems from a fungus
377.699	growing on the roots of living trees.
381.786	And it's a rare fungus.
383.437	Some species may fetch 3,000,
383.437	7,000, or more dollars per kilogram.
389.968	I learned from Paul
391.385	that the stakes for a truffle farmer
391.385	can be really high.
394.296	When he sources new truffles
394.296	to grow on his farms,
397.534	he's exposed to the threat
397.534	of knockoffs --
400.086	truffles that look and feel
400.086	like the real thing,
403.566	but they're of lower quality.
405.092	But even to a trained eye like Paul's,
407.545	even when looked at under a microscope,
409.651	these truffles can pass for authentic.
411.826	So in order to grow
411.826	the highest quality truffles,
415.776	the ones that chefs
415.776	all over the world will fight over,
419.039	Paul has to use DNA analysis.
422.594	Isn't that mind-blowing?
424.364	I bet you will never look
424.364	at that black truffle risotto again
427.688	without thinking of its genes.
429.382	(Laughter)
431.71	But personal DNA machines
431.71	can also save human lives.
437.045	Professor Ian Goodfellow is a virologist
437.045	at the University of Cambridge.
441.589	Last year he traveled to Sierra Leone.
444.267	When the Ebola outbreak
444.267	broke out in Western Africa,
448.213	he quickly realized that doctors there
448.213	lacked the basic tools
452.049	to detect and combat disease.
454.216	Results could take
454.216	up to a week to come back --
457.274	that's way too long for the patients
457.274	and the families who are suffering.
462.157	Ian decided to move his lab
462.157	into Makeni, Sierra Leone.
467.194	Here we see Ian Goodfellow
469.343	moving over 10 tons of equipment
469.343	into a pop-up tent
473.435	that he would equip to detect
473.435	and diagnose the virus
477.135	and sequence it within 24 hours.
480.25	But here's a surprise:
482.053	the same equipment that Ian could use
482.053	at his lab in the UK
486.199	to sequence and diagnose Ebola,
488.814	just wouldn't work under these conditions.
490.971	We're talking 35 Celsius heat
490.971	and over 90 percent humidity here.
496.153	But instead, Ian could use
496.153	personal DNA machines
499.061	small enough to be placed
499.061	in front of the air-conditioning unit
502.435	to keep sequencing the virus
504.39	and keep saving lives.
505.989	This may seem like
505.989	an extreme place for DNA analysis,
509.05	but let's move on to an even
509.05	more extreme environment:
512.85	outer space.
514.633	Let's talk about DNA analysis in space.
517.657	When astronauts live aboard
517.657	the International Space Station,
520.801	they're orbiting the planet
524.448	They're traveling
524.448	at 17,000 miles per hour.
527.274	Picture that --
528.456	you're seeing 15 sunsets
528.456	and sunrises every day.
532.817	You're also living in microgravity,
534.713	floating.
535.905	And under these conditions,
535.905	our bodies can do funky things.
539.091	One of these things is that
539.091	our immune systems get suppressed,
543.857	making astronauts more prone to infection.
547.856	A 16-year-old girl,
549.793	a high school student from New York,
549.793	Anna-Sophia Boguraev,
553.648	wondered whether changes
553.648	to the DNA of astronauts
556.541	could be related
556.541	to this immune suppression,
558.988	and through a science competition
558.988	"called ""Genes In Space,"""
562.381	Anna-Sophia designed an experiment
562.381	to test this hypothesis
566.312	using a personal DNA machine
566.312	aboard the International Space Station.
571.463	Here we see Anna-Sophia
571.463	on April 8, 2016, in Cape Canaveral,
577.186	watching her experiment launch
577.186	to the International Space Station.
581.273	That cloud of smoke is the rocket
583.828	that brought Anna-Sophia's experiment
583.828	to the International Space Station,
588.547	where, three days later,
590.5	astronaut Tim Peake
590.5	carried out her experiment --
594.272	in microgravity.
596.175	Personal DNA machines are now
596.175	aboard the International Space Station,
599.955	where they can help monitor
599.955	living conditions
602.566	and protect the lives of astronauts.
605.938	A 16-year-old designing a DNA experiment
609.803	to protect the lives of astronauts
611.74	may seem like a rarity,
611.74	the mark of a child genius.
615.784	Well, to me, it signals
615.784	something bigger:
618.378	that DNA technology is finally
618.378	within the reach of every one of you.
624.999	A few years ago,
626.73	a college student armed
626.73	with a personal computer
629.937	could code an app,
631.112	an app that is now a social network
631.112	with more than one billion users.
635.933	Could we be moving into a world
637.917	of one personal DNA machine in every home?
641.966	I know families who are already
641.966	living in this reality.
645.767	The Daniels family, for example,
647.689	set up a DNA lab in the basement
647.689	of their suburban Chicago home.
652.904	This is not a family
652.904	made of PhD scientists.
656.656	This is a family like any other.
658.79	They just like to spend time together
658.79	doing fun, creative things.
662.869	By day, Brian is an executive
662.869	at a private equity firm.
667.137	At night and on weekends,
667.137	he experiments with DNA
670.066	alongside his kids, ages seven and nine,
672.987	as a way to explore the living world.
675.48	Last time I called them,
677.178	they were checking out homegrown produce
677.178	from the backyard garden.
681.09	They were testing tomatoes
681.09	that they had picked,
683.411	taking the flesh of their skin,
683.411	putting it in a test tube,
686.215	mixing it with chemicals to extract DNA
688.321	and then using their home DNA copier
691.823	to test those tomatoes
691.823	for genetically engineered traits.
696.883	For the Daniels family,
698.434	the personal DNA machine
698.434	is like the chemistry set
701.357	for the 21st century.
703.375	Most of us may not yet
703.375	be diagnosing genetic conditions
707.261	in our kitchen sinks
709.123	or doing at-home paternity testing.
711.365	(Laughter)
712.414	But we've definitely reached
712.414	a point in history
714.658	where every one of you could actually
714.658	get hands-on with DNA
720.491	in your kitchen.
721.946	You could copy, paste and analyze DNA
725.157	and extract meaningful
725.157	information from it.
728.394	And it's at times like this
728.394	that profound transformation
731.275	is bound to happen;
732.898	moments when a transformative,
732.898	powerful technology
736.174	that was before limited
736.174	to a select few in the ivory tower,
739.82	finally becomes within the reach
739.82	of every one of us,
743.951	from farmers to schoolchildren.
746.772	Think about the moment
747.963	when phones stopped being
747.963	plugged into the wall by cords,
751.864	or when computers left the mainframe
754.183	and entered your home or your office.
757.574	The ripples of the personal DNA revolution
760.421	may be hard to predict,
761.972	but one thing is certain:
763.613	revolutions don't go backwards,
766.029	and DNA technology is already spreading
766.029	faster than our imagination.
770.318	So if you're curious,
772.241	get up close and personal
772.241	with DNA -- today.
775.48	It is in our DNA to be curious.
778.095	(Laughter)
779.134	Thank you.
780.318	(Applause)
