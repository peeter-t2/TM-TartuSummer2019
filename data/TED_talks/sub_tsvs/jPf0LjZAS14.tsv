12.68	I'm a journalist,
14.115	so I like to look for the untold stories,
16.69	the lives that quietly play out
16.69	under the scream of headlines.
20.977	I've also been going about the business
20.977	of putting down roots,
24.458	choosing a partner, making babies.
27.206	So for the last few years,
29.461	I've been trying to understand
30.948	what constitutes
30.948	the 21st-century good life,
35.085	both because I'm fascinated by the moral
35.085	and philosophical implications,
39.719	but also because I'm in desperate
39.719	need of answers myself.
43.641	We live in tenuous times.
46.402	In fact, for the first time
46.402	in American history,
49.611	the majority of parents do not think
49.611	that their kids will be better off
53.755	than they were.
55.211	This is true of rich and poor,
55.211	men and women.
59	Now, some of you
59	might hear this and feel sad.
61.589	After all, America is deeply invested
64.605	in this idea of economic transcendence,
67.508	that every generation kind of
67.508	leapfrogs the one before it,
71.092	earning more, buying more, being more.
75.299	We've exported this dream
75.299	all over the world,
77.481	so kids in Brazil and China and even Kenya
80.414	inherit our insatiable expectation
83.195	for more.
85.063	But when I read this historic poll
85.063	for the first time,
88.144	it didn't actually make me feel sad.
90.593	It felt like a provocation.
93.181	"""Better off"" -- based on whose standards?"
97.03	"Is ""better off"" finding a secure job"
99.137	that you can count on
99.137	for the rest of your life?
102.027	Those are nearly extinct.
103.788	People move jobs, on average,
103.788	every 4.7 years,
107.809	and it's estimated that by 2020,
109.794	nearly half of Americans
109.794	will be freelancers.
113.523	OK, so is better off just a number?
116.498	Is it about earning
116.498	as much as you possibly can?
120.06	By that singular measurement,
120.06	we are failing.
123.316	Median per capita income
123.316	has been flat since about 2000,
127.537	adjusted for inflation.
130.005	All right, so is better off getting
130.005	a big house with a white picket fence?
134.71	Less of us are doing that.
136.718	Nearly five million people lost
136.718	their homes in the Great Recession,
140.398	and even more of us sobered up
140.398	about the lengths we were willing to go --
144.796	or be tricked into going,
144.796	in many predatory cases --
147.567	to hold that deed.
149.575	Home-ownership rates
149.575	are at their lowest since 1995.
154.117	All right, so we're not
154.117	finding steady employment,
157.489	we're not earning as much money,
159.246	and we're not living in big fancy houses.
162.372	Toll the funeral bells
164.111	for everything that made America great.
168.147	But,
169.767	are those the best measurements
169.767	of a country's greatness,
173.697	of a life well lived?
175.87	What I think makes America great
175.87	is its spirit of reinvention.
180.034	In the wake of the Great Recession,
181.776	more and more Americans are redefining
181.776	"what ""better off"" really means."
186.412	Turns out, it has more to do
186.412	with community and creativity
190.422	than dollars and cents.
192.917	Now, let me be very clear:
195.48	the 14.8 percent of Americans
195.48	living in poverty need money,
200.697	plain and simple.
202.101	And all of us need policies
202.101	that protect us from exploitation
205.786	by employers and financial institutions.
209.011	Nothing that follows is meant to suggest
209.011	that the gap between rich and poor
213.686	is anything but profoundly immoral.
218.224	But,
219.553	too often we let
219.553	the conversation stop there.
222.804	We talk about poverty as if
222.804	it were a monolithic experience;
226.553	about the poor as if
226.553	they were solely victims.
230.126	Part of what I've learned
230.126	in my research and reporting
233.007	is that the art of living well
235.437	is often practiced most masterfully
238.449	by the most vulnerable.
242.253	Now, if necessity
242.253	is the mother of invention,
244.769	I've come to believe
246.491	that recession can be
246.491	the father of consciousness.
250.879	It confronts us with profound questions,
253.741	questions we might be too lazy
253.741	or distracted to ask
256.908	in times of relative comfort.
259.047	How should we work?
260.634	How should we live?
262.766	All of us, whether we realize it or not,
265.029	seek answers to these questions,
266.625	with our ancestors
266.625	kind of whispering in our ears.
271.02	My great-grandfather
271.02	was a drunk in Detroit,
275.167	who sometimes managed
275.167	to hold down a factory job.
278.611	He had, as unbelievable as it might sound,
283.446	with one woman, my great-grandmother,
285.852	who died at 47 years old
285.852	of ovarian cancer.
289.945	Now, I'm pregnant with my second child,
291.904	and I cannot even fathom
291.904	what she must have gone through.
296.502	And if you're trying to do the math --
296.502	there were six sets of twins.
300.81	So my grandfather, their son,
303.572	became a traveling salesman,
305.295	and he lived boom and bust.
306.814	So my dad grew up answering
306.814	the door for debt collectors
310.524	and pretending his parents weren't home.
312.979	He actually took his braces off himself
312.979	with pliers in the garage,
317.183	when his father admitted
317.183	he didn't have money
319.366	to go back to the orthodontist.
321.778	So my dad, unsurprisingly,
324.573	became a bankruptcy lawyer.
326.665	Couldn't write this in a novel, right?
329.236	He was obsessed with providing
329.236	a secure foundation
332.541	for my brother and I.
334.521	So I ask these questions
334.521	by way of a few generations of struggle.
338.895	My parents made sure that I grew up
338.895	on a kind of steady ground
341.976	that allows one to question
341.976	and risk and leap.
345.909	And ironically, and probably
345.909	sometimes to their frustration,
349.247	it is their steadfast
349.247	commitment to security
352.555	that allows me to question its value,
355.044	or at least its value
355.044	as we've historically defined it
358.046	in the 21st century.
360.87	So let's dig into this first question:
363.267	How should we work?
366.397	We should work like our mothers.
369.754	That's right -- we've spent decades
371.917	trying to fit women into a work world
371.917	built for company men.
376.358	And many have done backbends to fit in,
378.272	but others have carved
378.272	a more unconventional path,
381.652	creating a patchwork of meaning and money
383.875	with enough flexibility
383.875	to do what they need to do
386.62	for those that they love.
388.993	"My mom called it ""just making it work."""
391.574	Today I hear life coaches
391.574	"call it ""a portfolio career."""
395.956	Whatever you call it,
397.639	more and more men are craving
397.639	these whole, if not harried, lives.
403.332	They're waking up to their desire
403.332	and duty to be present fathers and sons.
408.547	Now, artist Ann Hamilton has said,
411.008	"""Labor is a way of knowing."""
414.458	Labor is a way of knowing.
415.77	In other words, what we work on
417.802	is what we understand about the world.
421.043	If this is true, and I think it is,
423.266	then women who have disproportionately
423.266	cared for the little ones
426.862	and the sick ones and the aging ones,
428.863	have disproportionately benefited
431.819	from the most profound kind
431.819	of knowing there is:
435.373	knowing the human condition.
438.442	By prioritizing care,
440.618	men are, in a sense, staking their claim
443.218	to the full range of human existence.
447.097	Now, this means the nine-to-five
447.097	no longer works for anyone.
450.685	Punch clocks are becoming obsolete,
450.685	as are career ladders.
453.535	Whole industries are being born
453.535	and dying every day.
456.627	It's all nonlinear from here.
459.09	So we need to stop asking kids,
461.126	"""What do you want to be when you grow up?"""
463.206	and start asking them,
463.206	"""How do you want to be when you grow up?"""
467.247	Their work will constantly change.
469.17	The common denominator is them.
471.504	So the more they understand their gifts
473.469	and create crews of ideal collaborators,
475.948	the better off they will be.
478.717	The challenge ahead is to reinvent
478.717	the social safety net
481.404	to fit this increasingly
481.404	fragmented economy.
484.365	We need portable health benefits.
486.248	We need policies that reflect
486.248	that everyone deserves to be vulnerable
489.881	or care for vulnerable others,
491.403	without becoming destitute.
493.035	We need to seriously consider
493.035	a universal basic income.
495.707	We need to reinvent labor organizing.
498.682	The promise of a work world
498.682	that is structured to actually fit
502.572	our 21st century values,
504.496	not some archaic idea
504.496	about bringing home the bacon,
507.457	is long overdue --
509.671	just ask your mother.
511.877	Now, how about the second question:
513.603	How should we live?
515.737	We should live
517.507	like our immigrant ancestors.
521.174	When they came to America,
522.635	they often shared apartments,
522.635	survival tactics, child care --
526.889	always knew how to fill one more belly,
528.919	no matter how small the food available.
531.77	But they were told that success meant
531.77	leaving the village behind
535.36	and pursuing that iconic symbol
535.36	of the American Dream,
538.436	the white picket fence.
540.46	And even today,
540.46	we see a white picket fence
542.508	and we think success, self-possession.
544.905	But when you strip away
544.905	the sentimentality,
547.16	what it really does is divides us.
550.14	Many Americans are rejecting
550.14	the white picket fence
552.737	and the kind of highly privatized life
552.737	that happened within it,
556.076	and reclaiming village life,
557.89	reclaiming interdependence instead.
561.311	Fifty million of us, for example,
562.938	live in intergenerational households.
566.018	This number exploded
566.018	with the Great Recession,
568.77	but it turns out people
568.77	actually like living this way.
571.432	Two-thirds of those who are living
571.432	with multiple generations under one roof
575.304	say it's improved their relationships.
578.145	Some people are choosing
578.145	to share homes not with family,
580.993	but with other people who understand
580.993	the health and economic benefits
584.377	of daily community.
586.082	CoAbode, an online platform
586.082	for single moms looking to share homes
589.74	with other single moms,
591.127	has 50,000 users.
593.761	And people over 65 are especially prone
596.422	to be looking for these alternative
596.422	living arrangements.
600.074	They understand that their quality of life
602.597	depends on a mix
602.597	of solitude and solidarity.
607.727	Which is true of all of us
607.727	when you think about it,
610.244	young and old alike.
611.632	For too long, we've pretended
611.632	that happiness is a king in his castle.
616.306	But all the research proves otherwise.
619.006	It shows that the healthiest,
619.006	happiest and even safest --
622.033	in terms of both climate change disaster,
622.033	in terms of crime, all of that --
628.131	are Americans who live lives
628.131	intertwined with their neighbors.
632.661	Now, I've experienced this firsthand.
635.076	For the last few years, I've been living
635.076	in a cohousing community.
638.292	It's 1.5 acres of persimmon trees,
641.925	this prolific blackberry bush
641.925	that snakes around a community garden,
645.701	all smack-dab, by the way,
645.701	in the middle of urban Oakland.
649.447	The nine units are all built
649.447	to be different,
651.59	different sizes, different shapes,
653.263	but they're meant to be
653.263	as green as possible.
655.401	So big, shiny black
655.401	solar cells on our roof
657.568	mean our electricity bill rarely exceeds
659.526	more than five bucks in a month.
661.787	The 25 of us who live there are all
661.787	different ages and political persuasions
665.622	and professions,
666.804	and we live in homes that have everything
666.804	a typical home would have.
670.106	But additionally,
671.284	we share an industrial-sized
671.284	kitchen and eating area,
673.824	where we have common meals twice a week.
675.913	Now, people, when I tell them
675.913	I live like this,
678.176	often have one of two extreme reactions.
680.106	"Either they say, ""Why doesn't"
680.106	"everyone live like this?"""
682.779	"Or they say, ""That sounds"
682.779	totally horrifying.
685.531	"I would never want to do that."""
687.054	So let me reassure you: there is
687.054	a sacred respect for privacy among us,
692.614	but also a commitment to what we call
692.614	"""radical hospitality"" --"
697.535	not the kind advertised
697.535	by the Four Seasons,
700.704	but the kind that says that every
700.704	single person is worthy of kindness,
706.355	full stop, end of sentence.
709.129	The biggest surprise for me
709.129	of living in a community like this?
713.335	You share all the domestic labor --
713.335	the repairing, the cooking, the weeding --
717.11	but you also share the emotional labor.
719.573	Rather than depending only
719.573	on the idealized family unit
722.62	to get all of your emotional needs met,
724.512	you have two dozen other people
724.512	that you can go to
726.945	to talk about a hard day at work
728.805	or troubleshoot how to handle
728.805	an abusive teacher.
732.038	Teenagers in our community will often go
732.038	to an adult that is not their parent
737.626	to ask for advice.
739.31	It's what bell hooks
739.31	"called ""revolutionary parenting,"""
742.853	this humble acknowledgment
744.675	that kids are healthier when they have
744.675	a wider range of adults
747.795	to emulate and count on.
750.451	Turns out, adults are healthier, too.
753.568	It's a lot of pressure,
755.18	trying to be that perfect family
755.18	behind that white picket fence.
760.29	"The ""new better off,"""
760.29	as I've come to call it,
762.658	is less about investing
762.658	in the perfect family
765.638	and more about investing
765.638	in the imperfect village,
769.147	whether that's relatives
769.147	living under one roof,
771.397	a cohousing community like mine,
773.261	or just a bunch of neighbors
773.261	who pledge to really know
776.215	and look out for one another.
778.134	It's good common sense, right?
780.466	And yet, money has often made us dumb
783.297	about reaching out.
785.575	The most reliable wealth
787.632	is found in relationship.
791.511	The new better off is not
791.511	an individual prospect at all.
795.384	In fact, if you're a failure
795.384	or you think you're a failure,
798.477	I've got some good news for you:
800.112	you might be a success by standards
800.112	you have not yet honored.
804.404	Maybe you're a mediocre earner
804.404	but a masterful father.
808.477	Maybe you can't afford your dream home,
810.383	but you throw legendary
810.383	neighborhood parties.
814.462	If you're a textbook success,
816.25	the implications of what I'm saying
816.25	could be more grim for you.
820.344	You might be a failure
820.344	by standards you hold dear
823.709	but that the world doesn't reward.
826.719	Only you can know.
829.31	I know that I am not a tribute
832.55	to my great-grandmother,
834.06	who lived such a short and brutish life,
836.753	if I earn enough money to afford
836.753	every creature comfort.
840.614	You can't buy your way
840.614	out of suffering or into meaning.
843.767	There is no home big enough
845.525	to erase the pain
845.525	that she must have endured.
849.435	I am a tribute to her
850.709	if I live a life as connected
850.709	and courageous as possible.
856.256	In the midst of such
856.256	widespread uncertainty,
859.281	we may, in fact, be insecure.
862.334	But we can let that insecurity
862.334	make us brittle
865.216	or supple.
866.859	We can turn inward, lose faith
866.859	in the power of institutions to change --
871.89	even lose faith in ourselves.
874.332	Or we can turn outward,
876.3	cultivate faith in our ability
876.3	to reach out, to connect, to create.
883.063	Turns out, the biggest danger
886.02	is not failing to achieve
886.02	the American Dream.
889.624	The biggest danger is achieving a dream
892.086	that you don't actually believe in.
895.362	So don't do that.
897.046	Do the harder, more interesting thing,
899.712	which is to compose a life
899.712	where what you do every single day,
903.784	the people you give your best love
903.784	and ingenuity and energy to,
907.486	aligns as closely as possible
907.486	with what you believe.
911.01	That, not something as mundane
911.01	as making money,
914.439	is a tribute to your ancestors.
916.432	That is the beautiful struggle.
920.861	Thank you.
922.076	(Applause)
