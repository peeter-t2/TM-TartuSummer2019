12.937	This is a photograph
14.633	of a man whom for many years
17.449	I plotted to kill.
21.17	This is my father,
24.19	"Clinton George ""Bageye"" Grant."
27.927	He's called Bageye because he has
30.198	permanent bags under his eyes.
34.358	As a 10-year-old, along with my siblings,
37.134	I dreamt of scraping off the poison
41.25	from fly-killer paper into his coffee,
45.2	grounded down glass and sprinkling it
47.055	over his breakfast,
50.044	loosening the carpet on the stairs
51.754	so he would trip and break his neck.
55.482	But come the day, he would always
57.109	skip that loose step,
59.361	he would always bow out of the house
61.19	without so much as a swig of coffee
63.03	or a bite to eat.
65.818	And so for many years,
67.104	I feared that my father would die
69.064	before I had a chance to kill him.
71.138	(Laughter)
75.73	Up until our mother asked him to leave
78.721	and not come back,
80.378	Bageye had been a terrifying ogre.
84.634	He teetered permanently on the verge of rage,
88.219	rather like me, as you see.
91.827	He worked nights at Vauxhall Motors in Luton
95.127	and demanded total silence throughout the house,
98.286	so that when we came home from school
100.958	at 3:30 in the afternoon, we would huddle
102.998	beside the TV, and rather like safe-crackers,
106.248	we would twiddle with the volume control knob
108.734	on the TV so it was almost inaudible.
111.527	And at times, when we were like this,
113.838	"so much ""Shhh,"" so much ""Shhh"""
116.27	going on in the house
118.135	that I imagined us to be like
120.11	the German crew of a U-boat
123.61	creeping along the edge of the ocean
126.102	whilst up above, on the surface,
127.918	HMS Bageye patrolled
131.663	ready to drop death charges
133.79	at the first sound of any disturbance.
137.777	So that lesson was the lesson that
140.712	"""Do not draw attention to yourself"
142.16	"either in the home or outside of the home."""
144.424	Maybe it's a migrant lesson.
147.11	We were to be below the radar,
150.28	so there was no communication, really,
151.775	between Bageye and us and us and Bageye,
154.936	and the sound that we most looked forward to,
157.544	you know when you're a child and you want
159.298	your father to come home
159.298	and it's all going to be happy
162.736	and you're waiting for that sound of the door opening.
164.49	Well the sound that we looked forward to
165.746	was the click of the door closing,
167.639	which meant he'd gone and would not come back.
172.347	So for three decades,
175.806	I never laid eyes on my father, nor he on me.
178.847	We never spoke to each other for three decades,
180.615	and then a couple of years ago, I decided
182.416	to turn the spotlight on him.
186.687	"""You are being watched."
188.575	Actually, you are.
190.431	"You are being watched."""
192.495	That was his mantra to us, his children.
195.159	Time and time again he would say this to us.
196.832	And this was the 1970s, it was Luton,
199.935	where he worked at Vauxhall Motors,
201.564	and he was a Jamaican.
203.391	And what he meant was,
204.45	you as a child of a Jamaican immigrant
206.561	are being watched
208.479	to see which way you turn, to see whether
210.136	you conform to the host nation's stereotype of you,
214.255	of being feckless, work-shy,
216.855	destined for a life of crime.
219.416	You are being watched,
221.15	so confound their expectations of you.
225.493	To that end, Bageye and his friends,
229.771	mostly Jamaican,
231.426	exhibited a kind of Jamaican bella figura:
235.18	Turn your best side to the world,
237.794	show your best face to the world.
240.068	If you have seen some of the images
241.842	of the Caribbean people arriving
243.978	in the '40s and '50s,
245.63	you might have noticed that a lot of the men
247.026	wear trilbies.
248.915	Now, there was no tradition
248.915	of wearing trilbies in Jamaica.
252.556	They invented that tradition for their arrival here.
255.499	They wanted to project themselves in a way
257.266	that they wanted to be perceived,
259.6	so that the way they looked
261.031	and the names that they gave themselves
263.974	defined them.
265.646	So Bageye is bald and has baggy eyes.
271.135	Tidy Boots is very fussy about his footwear.
275.147	Anxious is always anxious.
277.859	Clock has one arm longer than the other.
280.588	(Laughter)
284.236	And my all-time favorite was the
284.236	guy they called Summerwear.
287.61	When Summerwear came to this country
289.444	from Jamaica in the early '60s, he insisted
291.563	on wearing light summer suits,
293.94	no matter the weather,
295.596	and in the course of researching their lives,
296.934	"I asked my mom, ""Whatever"
296.934	"became of Summerwear?"""
299.91	"And she said, ""He caught a cold and died."" (Laughter)"
304.737	But men like Summerwear
306.593	taught us the importance of style.
308.055	Maybe they exaggerated their style
310.177	because they thought that they were not considered
313.393	to be quite civilized,
315.497	and they transferred that generational attitude
318.313	or anxiety onto us, the next generation,
320.913	so much so that when I was growing up,
323.1	if ever on the television news or radio
325.473	a report came up about a black person
326.981	committing some crime —
328.665	a mugging, a murder, a burglary —
332.329	we winced along with our parents,
335.881	because they were letting the side down.
338.545	You did not just represent yourself.
339.998	You represented the group,
341.74	and it was a terrifying thing to come to terms with,
346.248	in a way, that maybe you were going
348.512	to be perceived in the same light.
352.656	So that was what needed to be challenged.
356.428	Our father and many of his colleagues
360.709	exhibited a kind of transmission but not receiving.
364.17	They were built to transmit but not receive.
366.392	We were to keep quiet.
369.243	When our father did speak to us,
370.596	it was from the pulpit of his mind.
373.461	They clung to certainty in the belief
375.049	that doubt would undermine them.
379.178	But when I am working in my house
382.769	and writing, after a day's writing, I rush downstairs
386.62	and I'm very excited to talk about
386.62	Marcus Garvey or Bob Marley
389.926	and words are tripping out of my mouth like butterflies
392.79	and I'm so excited that my children stop me,
395.286	"and they say, ""Dad, nobody cares."""
398.966	(Laughter)
402.956	But they do care, actually.
404.87	They cross over.
406.433	Somehow they find their way to you.
408.94	They shape their lives according
408.94	to the narrative of your life,
412.544	as I did with my father and my mother, perhaps,
416.57	and maybe Bageye did with his father.
419.184	And that was clearer to me
420.826	in the course of looking at his life
423.784	and understanding, as they say,
426.84	the Native Americans say,
428.152	"""Do not criticize the man until you can walk"
429.781	"in his moccasins."""
432.093	But in conjuring his life, it was okay
434.992	and very straightforward to portray
438.26	a Caribbean life in England in the 1970s
441.24	with bowls of plastic fruit,
446.224	polystyrene ceiling tiles,
449.288	settees permanently sheathed
451.576	in their transparent covers
451.576	that they were delivered in.
454.948	But what's more difficult to navigate
456.8	is the emotional landscape
458.292	between the generations,
460.262	and the old adage that with age comes wisdom
465	is not true.
467.045	With age comes the veneer of respectability
470.528	and a veneer of uncomfortable truths.
473.896	But what was true was that my parents,
476.668	my mother, and my father went along with it,
479.144	did not trust the state to educate me.
481.912	So listen to how I sound.
484.402	They determined that they would
484.402	send me to a private school,
488.684	but my father worked at Vauxhall Motors.
490.441	It's quite difficult to fund a private school education
494.232	and feed his army of children.
496.872	I remember going on to the school
498.856	for the entrance exam, and my father said
500.98	to the priest — it was a Catholic school —
504.58	"he wanted a better ""heducation"" for the boy,"
508.807	but also, he, my father,
511.735	never even managed to pass worms,
514.375	never mind entrance exams.
516.995	But in order to fund my education,
518.94	he was going to have to do some dodgy stuff,
521.663	so my father would fund my education
524.765	by trading in illicit goods from the back of his car,
528.369	and that was made even more tricky because
529.801	my father, that's not his car by the way.
531.961	My father aspired to have a car like that,
533.769	but my father had a beaten-up Mini,
535.845	and he never, being a
535.845	Jamaican coming to this country,
540.343	he never had a driving license,
542.696	he never had any insurance or road tax or MOT.
546.26	"He thought, ""I know how to drive;"
548.199	"why do I need the state's validation?"""
551.279	But it became a little tricky when
551.279	we were stopped by the police,
553.511	and we were stopped a lot by the police,
555.724	and I was impressed by the way
556.941	that my father dealt with the police.
558.84	He would promote the policeman immediately,
561.648	so that P.C. Bloggs became Detective Inspector Bloggs
565.735	in the course of the conversation
566.919	and wave us on merrily.
568.903	So my father was exhibiting what we in Jamaica
570.771	"called ""playing fool to catch wise."""
574.953	But it lent also an idea
578.322	that actually he was being diminished
580.128	or belittled by the policeman —
582.432	as a 10-year-old boy, I saw that —
584.249	but also there was an ambivalence towards authority.
586.82	So on the one hand, there was
588.465	a mocking of authority,
590.092	but on the other hand, there was a deference
592.408	towards authority,
594.229	and these Caribbean people
596.184	had an overbearing obedience towards authority,
600.321	which is very striking, very strange in a way,
602.529	because migrants are very courageous people.
605.633	They leave their homes. My father and my mother
608.393	left Jamaica and they traveled 4,000 miles,
612.32	and yet they were infantilized by travel.
616.144	They were timid,
617.912	and somewhere along the line,
619.361	the natural order was reversed.
621.202	The children became the parents to the parent.
626.646	The Caribbean people came to
626.646	this country with a five-year plan:
629.143	they would work, some money, and then go back,
631.142	but the five years became 10, the 10 became 15,
633.965	and before you know it,
633.965	you're changing the wallpaper,
636.31	and at that point, you know you're here to stay.
639.942	Although there's still the kind of temporariness
642.406	that our parents felt about being here,
644.853	but we children knew that the game was up.
649.04	I think there was a feeling that
651.798	they would not be able to continue with the ideals
657.148	of the life that they expected.
659.155	The reality was very much different.
661.137	And also, that was true of the reality
663.211	of trying to educate me.
664.629	Having started the process,
664.629	my father did not continue.
668.691	It was left to my mother to educate me,
671.419	and as George Lamming would say,
674.14	it was my mother who fathered me.
677.919	Even in his absence, that old mantra remained:
680.261	You are being watched.
681.948	But such ardent watchfulness can lead to anxiety,
685.15	so much so that years later, when I was investigating
687.399	why so many young black men
688.713	were diagnosed with schizophrenia,
690.844	six times more than they ought to be,
693.351	I was not surprised to hear the psychiatrist say,
696.623	"""Black people are schooled in paranoia."""
701.081	And I wonder what Bageye would make of that.
704.952	Now I also had a 10-year-old son,
707.479	and turned my attention to Bageye
710.328	and I went in search of him.
711.704	He was back in Luton, he was now 82,
715.306	and I hadn't seen him for 30-odd years,
718.946	and when he opened the door,
720.544	I saw this tiny little man with lambent, smiling eyes,
724.448	and he was smiling, and I'd never seen him smile.
726.791	I was very disconcerted by that.
729.839	But we sat down, and he had
729.839	a Caribbean friend with him,
732.9	talking some old time talk,
735.455	and my father would look at me,
737.929	and he looked at me as if I would
739.583	miraculously disappear as I had arisen.
743.227	And he turned to his friend, and he said,
745.463	"""This boy and me have a deep, deep connection,"
748.423	"deep, deep connection."""
751.383	But I never felt that connection.
752.78	If there was a pulse, it was very weak
755.559	or hardly at all.
758.383	And I almost felt in the course of that reunion
760.223	that I was auditioning to be my father's son.
764.84	When the book came out,
766.832	it had fair reviews in the national papers,
768.568	but the paper of choice in Luton is not The Guardian,
771.84	it's the Luton News,
774.127	and the Luton News ran the headline about the book,
777.903	"""The Book That May Heal a 32-Year-Old Rift."""
783.122	And I understood that could also represent
786.434	the rift between one generation and the next,
788.337	between people like me and my father's generation,
792.341	but there's no tradition in Caribbean life
794.589	of memoirs or biographies.
796.693	It was a tradition that you didn't
796.693	chat about your business in public.
800.777	But I welcomed that title, and I thought actually, yes,
805.433	there is a possibility that this
807.329	will open up conversations
807.329	that we'd never had before.
811.522	This will close the generation gap, perhaps.
815.726	This could be an instrument of repair.
818.253	And I even began to feel that this book
820.654	may be perceived by my father
823.542	as an act of filial devotion.
827.718	Poor, deluded fool.
831.453	Bageye was stung by what he perceived to be
835.494	the public airing of his shortcomings.
838.353	He was stung by my betrayal,
841.254	and he went to the newspapers the next day
843.326	and demanded a right of reply,
844.51	and he got it with the headline
846.742	"""Bageye Bites Back."""
849.902	And it was a coruscating account of my betrayal.
852.87	I was no son of his.
855.748	He recognized in his mind that his colors
857.829	had been dragged through the
857.829	mud, and he couldn't allow that.
860.197	He had to restore his dignity, and he did so,
862.782	and initially, although I was disappointed,
865.21	I grew to admire that stance.
866.89	There was still fire bubbling through his veins,
870.293	even though he was 82 years old.
873.91	And if it meant that we would now return
876.472	to 30 years of silence,
879.703	"my father would say, ""If it's so, then it's so."""
885.663	Jamaicans will tell you that
885.663	there's no such thing as facts,
888.855	there are only versions.
890.88	We all tell ourselves the versions of the story
893.361	that we can best live with.
896.216	Each generation builds up an edifice
898.743	which they are reluctant or sometimes unable
900.81	to disassemble,
903.118	but in the writing, my version of the story
906.764	began to change,
908.832	and it was detached from me.
912.826	I lost my hatred of my father.
915.755	I did no longer want him to die or to murder him,
920.239	and I felt free,
924.483	much freer than I'd ever felt before.
929.347	And I wonder whether that freedness
931.227	could be transferred to him.
936.218	In that initial reunion,
940.57	I was struck by an idea that I had
942.946	very few photographs of myself
946.39	as a young child.
948.764	This is a photograph of me,
950.954	nine months old.
953.271	In the original photograph,
955.193	I'm being held up by my father, Bageye,
958.146	but when my parents separated, my mother
960.39	excised him from all aspects of our lives.
963.16	She took a pair of scissors and cut 
963.16	him out of every photograph,
967.224	and for years, I told myself
967.224	the truth of this photograph
970.766	was that you are alone,
973.77	you are unsupported.
976.57	But there's another way of looking at this photograph.
978.842	This is a photograph that has the potential
981.418	for a reunion,
983.922	a potential to be reunited with my father,
986.71	and in my yearning to be held up by my father,
990.774	I held him up to the light.
993.274	In that first reunion,
996.21	it was very awkward and tense moments,
998.512	and to lessen the tension,
999.854	we decided to go for a walk.
1003.192	And as we walked, I was struck
1005.193	that I had reverted to being the child
1007.464	even though I was now towering above my father.
1010.957	I was almost a foot taller than my father.
1013.208	He was still the big man,
1015.816	and I tried to match his step.
1020.537	And I realized that he was walking
1022.114	as if he was still under observation,
1024.89	but I admired his walk.
1027.801	He walked like a man
1030.129	on the losing side of the F.A. Cup Final
1033	mounting the steps to collect his condolence medal.
1036.952	There was dignity in defeat.
1040.576	Thank you.
1042.993	(Applause)
