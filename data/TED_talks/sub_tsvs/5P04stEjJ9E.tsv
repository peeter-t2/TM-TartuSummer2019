12.755	I'm excited to be here to speak about vets,
15.046	because I didn't join the Army
16.652	because I wanted to go to war.
18.8	I didn't join the Army because I had a lust
21.518	or a need to go overseas and fight.
25.175	Frankly, I joined the Army because
27.515	college is really damn expensive,
29.242	and they were going to help with that,
30.951	and I joined the Army because
33.291	it was what I knew,
35.447	and it was what I knew that I thought I could do well.
38.309	I didn't come from a military family.
40.707	I'm not a military brat.
41.95	No one in my family ever
41.95	had joined the military at all,
44.729	and how I first got introduced to the military
47.015	was when I was 13 years old
49.11	and I got sent away to military school,
51.789	because my mother had been threatening me
53.458	with this idea of military school
53.458	ever since I was eight years old.
56.564	I had some issues when I was coming up,
59.631	and my mother would always tell me, she's like,
61.659	"""You know, if you don't get this together,"
63.105	"I'm going to send you to military school."""
64.371	"And I'd look at her, and I'd say, ""Mommy,"
65.931	"I'll work harder."""
67.863	And then when I was nine years old,
69.347	she started giving me brochures
69.347	to show me she wasn't playing around,
71.575	so I'd look at the brochures, and I'm like,
72.87	"""Okay, Mommy, I can see you're"
72.87	"serious, and I'll work harder."""
75.197	And then when I was 10 and 11,
77.349	my behavior just kept on getting worse.
80.503	I was on academic and disciplinary probation
82.87	before I hit double digits,
86.601	and I first felt handcuffs on my wrists
89.543	when I was 11 years old.
91.491	And so when I was 13 years old,
93.107	my mother came up to me, and she was like,
95.121	"""I'm not going to do this anymore."
96.857	"I'm going to send you to military school."""
98.403	"And I looked at her, and I said, ""Mommy,"
100.241	I can see you're upset, and
100.241	"I'm going to work harder."""
103.381	"And she was like, ""No, you're going next week."""
105.476	And that was how I first got introduced
107.881	to this whole idea of the military,
110.471	because she thought this was a good idea.
113.367	I had to disagree with her wholeheartedly
115.179	when I first showed up there,
116.479	because literally in the first four days,
118.279	I had already run away five times from this school.
120.447	They had these big black gates
120.447	that surrounded the school,
122.333	and every time they would turn their backs,
124.423	I would just simply run out of the black gates
126.879	and take them up on their offer
126.879	that if we don't want to be there,
128.741	we can leave at any time.
130.171	"So I just said, ""Well, if that's the case,"
131.864	"then I'd like to leave."" (Laughter)"
135.112	And it never worked.
137.223	And I kept on getting lost.
139.397	But then eventually,
140.579	after staying there for a little while,
143.109	and after the end of that first year
144.511	at this military school,
146.359	I realized that I actually was growing up.
151.015	I realized the things that I enjoyed about this school
154.539	and the thing that I enjoyed about the structure
156.887	was something that I'd never found before:
159.634	the fact that I finally felt like I
159.634	was part of something bigger,
162.503	part of a team, and it actually mattered to people
164.953	that I was there,
166.665	the fact that leadership wasn't just a punchline there,
169.855	but that it was a real, actually core part
173.131	of the entire experience.
175.28	And so when it was time for me to actually
177.404	finish up high school,
179.448	I started thinking about what I wanted to do,
182.116	and just like probably most students,
183.92	had no idea what that meant or what I wanted to do.
187.314	And I thought about the people who I
189.009	respected and admired.
191.298	I thought about a lot of the people,
192.984	in particular a lot of the men, in my life
195.803	who I looked up to.
197.732	They all happened to wear the uniform
199.607	of the United States of America,
201.546	so for me, the question and the answer
203.791	really became pretty easy.
205.858	The question of what I wanted to do
207.606	was filled in very quickly with saying,
209.244	I guess I'll be an Army officer.
212.443	So the Army then went through this process
214.267	and they trained me up,
215.468	and when I say I didn't join the Army
216.87	because I wanted to go to war,
218.5	the truth is, I joined in 1996.
220.583	There really wasn't a whole lot going on.
223.353	I didn't ever feel like I was in danger.
225.419	When I went to my mom,
226.542	I first joined the Army when I was 17 years old,
228.155	so I literally needed parental permission
229.864	to join the Army,
230.947	so I kind of gave the paperwork to my mom,
232.427	and she just assumed it was
232.427	kind of like military school.
234.42	"She was like, ""Well, it was good for him before,"
235.724	"so I guess I'll just let him keep doing it,"""
238.107	having no idea that the
238.107	paperwork that she was signing
240.908	was actually signing her son up
242.94	to become an Army officer.
246.138	And I went through the process,
247.912	and again the whole time still just thinking,
249.706	this is great, maybe I'll serve on a weekend,
253.529	or two weeks during the year, do drill,
258.643	and then a couple years after I signed up,
261.359	a couple years after my mother signed those papers,
263.945	the whole world changed.
267.671	And after 9/11, there was an entirely new context
270.875	about the occupation that I chose.
274.865	When I first joined, I never joined to fight,
279.43	but now that I was in,
281.1	this is exactly what was now going to happen.
284.887	And I thought about so much about the soldiers
288.234	who I eventually had to end up leading.
290.091	I remember when we first, right after 9/11,
292.601	three weeks after 9/11, I was
292.601	on a plane heading overseas,
295.224	but I wasn't heading overseas with the military,
297.21	I was heading overseas because I got a scholarship
299.245	to go overseas.
300.566	I received the scholarship to go overseas
302.416	and to go study and live overseas,
304.716	and I was living in England and that was interesting,
306.788	but at the same time, the same people who
308.254	I was training with,
310.998	the same soldiers that I went
310.998	through all my training with,
313.411	and we prepared for war,
315.6	they were now actually heading over to it.
319.086	They were now about to find themselves
320.967	in the middle of places the fact is
323.151	the vast majority of people,
324.719	the vast majority of us as we were training,
326.985	couldn't even point out on a map.
330.924	I spent a couple years finishing graduate school,
332.69	and the whole entire time while I'm sitting there
334.95	in buildings at Oxford
336.536	that were literally built hundreds of years
338.91	before the United States was even founded,
340.758	and I'm sitting there talking to dons
343.93	about the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand,
347.894	and how that influenced the start of World War I,
352.216	where the entire time my heart and my head
354.46	were on my soldiers
357.344	who were now throwing on Kevlars
359.314	and grabbing their flak vests
360.75	and figuring out how exactly do I change around
363.298	or how exactly do I clean a machine gun
365.59	in the darkness.
368.638	That was the new reality.
371.571	By the time I finished that up and I rejoined
373.944	my military unit and we were getting
373.944	ready to deploy to Afghanistan,
376.634	there were soldiers in my unit who were now
378.222	on their second and third deployments
380.32	before I even had my first.
381.74	I remember walking out with
381.74	my unit for the first time,
383.728	and when you join the Army
385.092	and you go through a combat tour,
386.748	everyone looks at your shoulder,
388.082	because on your shoulder is your combat patch.
391.86	And so immediately as you meet people,
393.136	you shake their hand,
394.552	and then your eyes go to their shoulder,
396.411	because you want to see where did they serve,
398.024	or what unit did they serve with?
399.33	And I was the only person walking around
401.024	with a bare shoulder,
403.314	and it burned every time someone stared at it.
407.404	But you get a chance to talk to your soldiers,
410.412	and you ask them why did they sign up.
414.19	I signed up because college was expensive.
418.279	A lot of my soldiers signed up
418.279	for completely different reasons.
422.7	They signed up because of a sense of obligation.
424.632	They signed up because they were angry
426.441	and they wanted to do something about it.
428.258	They signed up because
429.57	their family said this was important.
431.416	They signed up because they
431.416	wanted some form of revenge.
433.628	They signed for a whole
433.628	collection of different reasons.
438.276	And now we all found ourselves overseas
441.044	fighting in these conflicts.
444.945	And what was amazing to me was that I
447.456	very naively started hearing this statement
451.778	that I never fully understood,
455.044	because right after 9/11, you start hearing this idea
457.402	where people come up to you and they say,
458.759	"""Well, thank you for your service."""
461.396	And I just kind of followed in and started saying
463.359	the same things to all my soldiers.
464.994	This is even before I deployed.
466.575	But I really had no idea what that even meant.
470.07	I just said it because it sounded right.
472.074	I said it because it sounded like the right thing to say
473.85	to people who had served overseas.
475.494	"""Thank you for your service."""
477.924	But I had no idea what the context was
479.94	or what that even,
482.27	what it even meant to the people who heard it.
485.84	When I first came back from Afghanistan,
490.626	I thought that if you make it back from conflict,
494.1	then the dangers were all over.
497.941	I thought that if you made it
497.941	back from a conflict zone
500.138	that somehow you could kind of
502.437	wipe the sweat off your brow and say,
503.671	"""Whew, I'm glad I dodged that one,"""
507.415	without understanding that for so many people,
509.223	as they come back home,
511.366	the war keeps going.
513.665	It keeps playing out in all of our minds.
515.919	It plays out in all of our memories.
518.557	It plays out in all of our emotions.
523.22	Please forgive us
524.557	if we don't like being in big crowds.
529.767	Please forgive us
532.03	when we spend one week in a place
534.354	that has 100 percent light discipline,
536.702	because you're not allowed to
536.702	walk around with white lights,
538.93	because if anything has a white light,
540.417	it can be seen from miles away,
541.894	versus if you use little green
543.607	or little blue lights,
544.774	they cannot be seen from far away.
546.706	So please forgive us if out of nowhere,
548.839	we go from having 100 percent light discipline
552.046	to then a week later being back
552.046	in the middle of Times Square,
554.599	and we have a difficult time adjusting to that.
559.73	Please forgive us
561.162	when you transition back to a family
563.001	who has completely been maneuvering without you,
567.105	and now when you come back, it's not that easy
569.132	to fall back into a sense of normality,
572.776	because the whole normal has changed.
577.258	I remember when I came back,
577.258	I wanted to talk to people.
580.82	I wanted people to ask me about my experiences.
583.579	I wanted people to come up to me and tell me,
585.327	"""What did you do?"""
586.642	I wanted people to come up to me and tell me,
588.129	"""What was it like? What was the food like?"
589.747	"What was the experience like? How are you doing?"""
594.272	And the only questions I got from people was,
596.333	"""Did you shoot anybody?"""
599.064	And those were the ones who were even curious
600.89	enough to say anything.
604.548	Because sometimes there's this fear
606.218	and there's this apprehension that if I say anything,
607.783	I'm afraid I'll offend,
609.259	or I'm afraid I'll trigger something,
610.633	so the common default is just saying nothing.
615.291	The problem with that
617.89	is then it feels like your service
619.496	was not even acknowledged,
622.01	like no one even cared.
625.017	"""Thank you for your service,"""
628.04	and we move on.
631.133	What I wanted to better understand
633.809	was what's behind that,
637.123	"and why ""thank you for your service"" isn't enough."
642.875	The fact is, we have literally
646.491	2.6 million men and women
649.048	who are veterans of Iraq or Afghanistan
651.972	who are all amongst us.
654.642	Sometimes we know who they are,
656.122	sometimes we don't,
659.234	but there is that feeling, the shared experience,
661.401	the shared bond
664.325	where we know that that experience
666.197	and that chapter of our life,
668.206	while it might be closed,
670.921	it's still not over.
674.967	"We think about ""thank you for your service,"""
676.596	"and people say, ""So what does 'thank"
676.596	"you for your service' mean to you?"""
678.665	"Well, ""Thank you for your service"" means to me,"
680.345	it means acknowledging our stories,
684.423	asking us who we are,
687.289	understanding the strength
689.702	that so many people, so many
689.702	people who we serve with, have,
693.932	and why that service means so much.
697.652	"""Thank you for your service"""
697.652	means acknowledging the fact
699.786	that just because we've now come home
701.604	and we've taken off the uniform
702.895	does not mean our larger service to this country
705.175	is somehow over.
707.851	The fact is, there's still a tremendous amount
710.732	that can be offered and can be given.
714.922	When I look at people
716.352	like our friend Taylor Urruela,
721.01	who in Iraq loses his leg,
722.754	had two big dreams in his life.
725.412	One was to be a soldier. The other
725.412	was to be a baseball player.
728.48	He loses his leg in Iraq.
733.28	He comes back
734.904	and instead of deciding that,
736.598	well, now since I've lost my
736.598	leg, that second dream is over,
739.016	he decides that he still has that
739.016	dream of playing baseball,
741.43	and he starts this group called VETSports,
743.402	which now works with veterans all over the country
745.313	and uses sports as a way of healing.
750.648	People like Tammy Duckworth,
752.991	who was a helicopter pilot
754.239	and with the helicopter that she was flying,
756.105	you need to use both your hands
757.644	and also your legs to steer,
759.175	and her helicopter gets hit,
760.644	and she's trying to steer the chopper,
761.906	but the chopper's not reacting
763.823	to her instructions and to her commands.
765.504	She's trying to land the chopper safely,
768.015	but the chopper doesn't land safely,
769.656	and the reason it's not landing safely
770.768	is because it's not responding to the
770.768	commands that her legs are giving
773.441	because her legs were blown off.
778.289	She barely survives.
781.194	Medics come and they save her life,
785.1	but then as she's doing her
785.1	recuperation back at home,
787.561	"she realizes that, ""My job's still not done."""
791.871	And now she uses her voice
793.355	as a Congresswoman from Illinois
795.547	to fight and advocate for a collection of issues
798.505	to include veterans issues.
802.37	We signed up because
805.096	we love this country we represent.
809.566	We signed up because
811.91	we believe in the idea and we believe in the people
814.468	to our left and to our right.
817.256	And the only thing we then ask is that
819.168	"""thank you for your service"""
821.43	needs to be more than just a quote break,
824.554	"that ""thank you for your service"" means"
827.18	honestly digging in
829.406	to the people who have stepped up
832.356	simply because they were asked to,
836.199	and what that means for us not just now,
838.228	not just during combat operations,
841.72	but long after the last vehicle has left
845.069	and after the last shot has been taken.
849.943	These are the people who I served with,
852.773	and these are the people who I honor.
856.477	So thank you for your service.
858.648	(Applause)
