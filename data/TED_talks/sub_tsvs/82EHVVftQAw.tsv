12.613	As a kid, I was fascinated with all things air and space.
17.051	I would watch Nova on PBS.
19.592	Our school would show Bill Nye the Science Guy.
22.545	When I was in elementary school, my next door neighbor,
26.67	he gave me a book for my birthday.
28.52	It was an astronomy book,
29.689	and I poured over that thing for hours on end,
32.641	and it was a combination of all these things
35.241	that inspired me to pursue space exploration
38.909	as my own personal dream, and part of that dream was,
43.377	I always wanted to just fly around the solar system
45.986	and visit different planets and visit moons and spacecraft.
49.383	Well, a number of years later, I graduated from UCLA
54.077	and I found myself at NASA,
56.259	working for the jet propulsion laboratory,
58.363	and there our team was challenged
61.058	to create a 3D visualization of the solar system,
65.447	and today I want to show you what we've done so far.
69.321	Now, the kicker is, everything I'm about to do here
72.707	you can do at home, because we built this
76.513	for the public for you guys to use.
79.323	So what you're looking at right now is the Earth.
81.244	You can see the United States and California
83.215	and San Diego, and you can use the mouse
85.994	or the keyboard to spin things around.
88.049	Now, this isn't new. Anyone who's used Google Earth
91.488	has seen this before, but one thing we like to say
94.499	in our group is, we do the opposite of Google Earth.
98.312	Google Earth goes from this view down to your backyard.
102.361	We go from this view out to the stars.
105.894	So the Earth is cool, but what we really want to show
108.821	are the spacecraft,
110.687	so I'm going to bring the interface back up,
113.432	and now you're looking at a number of satellites
116.154	orbiting the Earth.
117.091	These are a number of our science space Earth orbiters.
120.373	We haven't included military satellites and weather satellites
122.691	and communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites.
124.704	If we did, it would be a complete mess,
127.203	because there's a lot of stuff out there.
129.259	And the cool thing is, we actually created 3D models
133.064	for a number of these spacecraft, so if you want to visit
136.329	any of these, all you need to do is double-click on them.
139.355	So I'm going to find the International Space Station,
142.591	double-click, and it will take us all the way down to the ISS.
147.598	And now you're riding along with the ISS
150.207	where it is right now.
153.402	And the other cool thing is, not only can we
155.194	move the camera around, we can also control time,
158.469	so I can slide this jog dial here
160.582	to shuttle time forward, and now
162.877	we can see what a sunset on the ISS would look like,
167.31	and they get one every 90 minutes. (Laughter)
172.763	All right, so what about the rest of it?
175.346	Well, I can click on this home button over here,
177.987	and that will take us up to the inner solar system,
180.954	and now we're looking at the rest of the solar system.
183.081	You can see, there's Saturn, there's Jupiter,
185.624	and while we're here, I want to point out something.
188.74	It's actually pretty busy.
191.297	Here we have the Mars Science Laboratory
193.386	on its way to Mars, just launched last weekend.
195.929	Here we have Juno on its cruise to Jupiter, there.
199.911	We have Dawn orbiting Vesta,
201.873	and we have over here New Horizons
203.883	on a straight shot to Pluto.
206.341	And I mention this because
208.296	there's this strange public perception that
211.101	NASA's dead, that the space shuttles stopped flying
213.894	and all of the sudden there's no more spacecraft out there.
216.478	Well, a lot of what NASA does is robotic exploration,
221.057	and we have a lot of spacecraft out there.
223.656	Granted, we're not sending humans up at the moment,
225.929	well at least with our own launch vehicles,
228.736	but NASA is far from dead,
230.98	and one of the reasons why we write a program like this
234.31	is so that people realize that there's so many other things
236.797	that we're doing.
238.488	Anyway, while we're here, again,
240.21	if you want to visit anything,
242.14	all you need to do is double-click.
244.057	So I'm just going to double-click on Vesta,
246.627	and here we have Dawn orbiting Vesta,
250.721	and this is happening right now.
252.911	I'm going to double-click on Uranus, and we can see
257.118	Uranus rotating on its side along with its moons.
260.426	You can see how it's tilted at about 89 degrees.
264.218	And just being able to visit different places
268.178	and go through different times,
269.464	we have data from 1950 to 2050.
272.559	Granted, we don't have everything in between,
274.776	because some of the data is hard to get.
276.542	Just being able to visit places in different times,
280.457	you can explore this for hours,
284.125	literally hours on end,
286.081	but I want to show you one thing in particular,
288.959	so I'm going to open up the destination tab,
291.344	spacecraft outer planet missions, Voyager 1,
294.731	and I'm going to bring up the Titan flyby.
297.731	So now we've gone back in time.
300.521	We're now riding along with Voyager 1.
303.458	The date here is November 11, 1980.
306.855	Now, there's a funny thing going on here.
309.184	It doesn't look like anything's going on.
311.377	It looks like I've paused the program.
313.477	It's actually running at real rate right now,
315.503	one second per second, and in fact,
317.503	Voyager 1 here is flying by Titan at
321.061	I think it's 38,000 miles per hour.
325.171	It only looks like nothing's moving because, well,
327.874	Saturn here is 700,000 miles away,
330.68	and Titan here is 4,000 to 5,000 miles away.
333.522	It's just the vastness of space makes it look like nothing's happening.
337.607	But to make it more interesting,
339.485	I'm going to speed up time, and we can watch
342.331	as Voyager 1 flies by Titan,
344.986	which is a hazy moon of Saturn.
347.201	It actually has a very thick atmosphere.
349.505	And I'm going to recenter the camera on Saturn, here.
352.766	I'm going to pull out, and I want to show you
356.655	Voyager 1 as it flies by Saturn.
359.885	There's a point to be made here.
362.135	With a 3D visualization like this,
364.777	we can not only just say Voyager 1 flew by Saturn.
368.558	There's a whole story to tell here.
370.18	And even better, because it's an interactive application,
373.036	you can tell the story for yourself.
375.016	If you want to pause it, you can pause it.
377.221	If you want to keep going, if you want to change
378.708	the camera angle, you can do that,
381.032	and because of that, I can show you
383.555	that Voyager 1 doesn't just fly by Saturn.
386.376	It actually flies underneath Saturn.
390.355	Now, what happens is, as it flies underneath Saturn,
393.725	Saturn grabs it gravitationally and flings it up
396.636	and out of the solar system,
398.926	so if I just keep letting this go,
401.964	you can see Voyager 1 fly up like that.
406.621	And, in fact, I'm going to go back to the solar system.
408.753	I'm going to go back to today, now,
411.661	and I want to show you where Voyager 1 is.
415.307	Right there, above, way above the solar system,
419.91	way beyond our solar system.
422.45	And here's the thing. Now you know how it got there.
425.037	Now you know why, and to me,
426.665	that's the point of this program.
428.453	You can manipulate it yourself.
431.726	You can fly around yourself and you can learn for yourself.
435.022	"You know, the theme today is ""The World In Your Grasp."""
438.513	Well, we're trying to give you
439.935	the solar system in your grasp — (Laughter) —
441.532	and we hope once it's there,
443.081	you'll be able to learn for yourself
445.334	what we've done out there, and what we're about to do.
447.528	And my personal dream is for kids to take this
451.027	and explore and see the wonders out there
453.712	and be inspired, as I was as a kid,
456.721	to pursue STEM education
458.279	and to pursue a dream in space exploration.
461.029	Thank you. (Applause)
