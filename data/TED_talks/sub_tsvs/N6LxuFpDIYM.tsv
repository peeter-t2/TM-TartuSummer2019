12.833	An 18-year-old, African-American male
12.833	joined the United States Air Force
18.331	and was assigned to Mountain Home 
18.331	Air Force Base
21.585	and was a part of the air police squadron.
24.472	Upon first arriving there,
24.472	the first goal that I had
28.121	was for me to identify an apartment,
30.897	so I could bring my wife 
30.897	and my new baby, Melanie,
34.717	out to join me in Idaho.
36.707	I immediately went to 
36.707	the personnel office,
39.219	and talking with the guys in personnel,
41.153	"they said, ""Hey, no problem finding "
41.153	an apartment in Mountain Home, Idaho.
46.319	The people down there love us 
46.319	because they know if they have an airman
51.509	who is coming in to rent 
51.509	one of their apartments,
53.872	"they'll always get their money."""
56.235	And that was a really important thing.
58.108	"He said, ""So here is a list "
58.108	of people that you can call,
60.927	and then they will then allow you 
60.927	"to select the apartment that you want."""
64.942	So I got the list; I made the call.
67.806	The lady answered on the other end
67.806	and I told her what I wanted.
70.824	"She said, ""Oh, great you called."
73.126	We have four or five apartments
73.126	"available right now."""
77.078	"She said, ""Do you want "
77.078	"a one-bedroom or two-bedroom?"""
80.072	"Then she said, ""Let's not talk about that."
82.125	Just come on down, 
82.125	select the apartment that you want.
84.946	We'll sign the contract
86.834	and you'll have keys in your hand
86.834	"to get your family out here right away."""
90.741	So I was excited.
92.27	I jumped in my car. I went downtown
92.27	and knocked on the door.
95.666	When I knocked on the door, 
95.666	the woman came to the door,
98.327	and she looked at me, and she said,
98.327	"""Can I help you?"""
101.261	"I said, ""Yes, I'm the person "
101.261	who called about the apartments.
105.102	I was just coming down 
105.102	"to make my selection."""
107.516	"She said, ""You know what? "
107.516	I'm really sorry,
110.052	but my husband rented those apartments
110.052	"and didn't tell me about them."""
114.14	"I said, ""You mean he rented "
114.14	"all five of them in one hour?"""
119.075	She didn't give me a response,
119.075	and what she said was this:
122.46	"She said, ""Why don't you"
122.46	leave your number,
124.685	and if we have some openings, 
124.685	"I'll give you a call?"""
127.722	Needless to say,
127.722	I did not get a call from her.
131.004	Nor did I get any responses 
131.004	from the other people
134.28	that they gave me on the list
134.28	where I could get apartments.
137.801	So as a result of that,
137.801	and feeling rejected,
140.092	I went back to the base, and I talked
140.092	to the squadron commander.
143.978	His name was McDow, Major McDow.
146.244	"I said, ""Major McDow, I need your help."""
148.436	I told him what happened, 
148.436	and here's what he said to me:
151.111	"He said, ""James, I would love to help you."
153.453	But you know the problem:
155.182	We can't make people rent to folks 
155.182	that they don't want to rent to.
159.416	And besides, we have a great relationship
159.416	with people in the community
163.914	"and we really don't want to damage that."""
165.956	"He said, ""So maybe this is "
165.956	what you should do.
168.226	Why don't you let your family stay home,
170.864	because you do know 
170.864	that you get a 30-day leave.
173.818	So once a year,
175.213	you can go home to your family,
175.213	"spend 30 days and then come on back."""
179.818	Needless to say, that didn't
179.818	resonate for me.
181.988	So after leaving him, 
181.988	I went back to personnel,
184.914	and talking to the clerk,
186.414	"he said, ""Jim, I think I have a "
186.414	solution for you.
189.215	There's an airman who is leaving
189.215	and he has a trailer.
193.507	If you noticed, in Mountain Home,
195.343	there are trailer parks and trailers
195.343	all over the place.
197.991	You can buy his trailer,
197.991	and you'd probably get a really good deal
201.534	because he wants to get out of town
201.534	as soon as possible.
204.208	And that would take care of your problem,
206.19	and that would provide 
206.19	"the solution for you."""
208.342	So I immediately jumped in my car,
208.342	went downtown, saw the trailer --
211.578	it was a small trailer,
213.422	but under the circumstances,
215.032	I figured that was the 
215.032	best thing that I could do.
217.447	So I bought the trailer.
219.008	And then I asked him, 
219.008	"""Can I just leave the trailer here,"
222.279	and that would take care 
222.279	of all my problems,
224.513	I wouldn't have to find
224.513	"another trailer park?"""
226.682	"He said, ""Before I say yes to that, "
226.682	"I need to check with management."""
230.536	So I get back to the base,
231.968	he called me back and management said,
234.125	"""No, you can't leave the trailer here"
236.569	because we had promised that slot
236.569	"to some other people."""
240.133	And that was strange to me
241.944	because there were several 
241.944	other slots that were open,
244.515	but it just so happened that he 
244.515	had promised that slot to someone else.
248.202	So, what I did --
249.504	"and he said, ""You shouldn't worry, Jim,"
249.504	"because there are a lot of trailer parks."""
253.571	So I put out another exhaustive list
253.571	of going to trailer parks.
257.42	I went to one after another, 
257.42	after another.
259.49	And I got the same kind of rejection there
262.092	that I received when I was looking 
262.092	for the apartment.
266.221	And as a result, the kind of comments
266.221	that they made to me,
270.55	in addition to saying that they
270.55	didn't have any slots open,
274.753	"one person said, ""Jim, the reason"
274.753	why we can't rent to you,
279.008	we already have a Negro family
279.008	"in the trailer park."""
283.188	"He said, ""And it's not me, "
283.188	"because I like you people."""
287.224	(Laughs)
288.526	And that's what I did, too.
288.526	I chuckled, too.
292.257	"He said, ""But here's the problem:"
294.233	If I let you in, the other tenants 
294.233	will move out
298.542	and I can't afford to take
298.542	"that kind of a hit."""
301.725	"He said, ""I just can't rent to you."""
304.052	Even though that was discouraging,
304.052	it didn't stop me.
306.603	I kept looking,
307.933	and I looked at the far end 
307.933	of the town in Mountain Home,
312.233	and there was a small trailer park.
314.327	I mean, a really small trailer park.
316.414	It didn't have any paved roads in it,
318.462	it didn't have the concrete slabs,
320.47	it didn't have fencing
322.019	to portion off your trailer slot 
322.019	from other trailer slots.
325.111	It didn't have a laundry facility.
326.923	But the conclusion I reached 
326.923	at that moment
329.116	was that I didn't have 
329.116	a lot of other options.
331.398	So I called my wife, and I said,
331.398	"""We're going to make this one work."""
334.854	And we moved into it
336.399	and we became homeowners
336.399	in Mountain Home, Idaho.
340.117	And of course, eventually
340.117	things settled down.
344.758	Four years after that, I received papers
344.758	to move from Mountain Home, Idaho
350.236	to a place called Goose Bay, Labrador.
353.27	We won't even talk about that.
353.27	It was another great location. (Laughter)
357.18	So my challenge then was to get my family 
357.18	from Mountain Home, Idaho
361.888	to Sharon, Pennsylvania.
363.639	That wasn't a problem because we
363.639	had just purchased a brand-new automobile.
367.169	My mother called 
367.169	and said she'll fly out.
369.569	She'll be with us as we drive,
369.569	she'll help us manage the children.
373.951	So she came out, her and Alice 
373.951	put a lot of food together for the trip.
377.881	That morning, we left at about 5 a.m.
380.964	Great trip, having a great time, 
380.964	good conversation.
384.11	Somewhere around 6:30, 7 o'clock,
384.11	we got a little bit tired,
387.944	"and we said, ""Why don't we get"
387.944	a motel so that we can rest
390.783	and then have an early start
390.783	"in the morning?"""
393.164	So we were looking at a number 
393.164	of the motels as we drove down the road,
396.544	and we saw one, it was a great
396.544	big, bright flashing light that said,
400.021	"""Vacancies, Vacancies, Vacanies."""
402.325	So we stopped in.
403.622	They were in the parking lot, 
403.622	I went inside.
405.807	When I walked inside,
407.134	the lady was just finishing up 
407.134	one contract with some folks,
410.311	some other people 
410.311	were coming in behind me.
412.4	And so I walked to the counter,
414.133	"and she said, ""How can I help you?"""
416.296	"I said, ""I would like to get a motel "
416.296	"for the evening for my family."""
419.556	"She said, ""You know, I'm really sorry,"
419.556	I just rented the last one.
424.058	We will not have any more 
424.058	"until the morning."""
426.704	"She said, ""But if you go down the road"
426.704	about an hour, 45 minutes,
430.685	"there's another trailer park down there."""
433.03	"I said, ""Yeah, but you still have the "
433.03	"'Vacancies' light on, and it's flashing."""
436.811	"She said, ""Oh, I forgot."""
438.287	And she reached over 
438.287	and turned the light off.
440.663	She looked at me and I looked at her.
442.904	There were other people in the room.
444.662	She kind of looked at them.
444.662	No one said anything.
447.068	So I just got the hint and I left,
447.068	and went outside to the parking lot.
450.424	And I told my mother and I told my wife
450.424	and also Melanie, and I said,
454.574	"""It looks like we're going to have to"
454.574	drive a little bit further down the road
458.37	"to be able to sleep tonight."""
460.726	And we did drive down the road,
462.899	but just before we took off 
462.899	and pulled out of the parking lot,
466.421	guess what happened?
467.914	The light came back on.
469.733	"And it said, ""Vacancies, "
469.733	"Vacancies, Vacancies."""
472.593	We were able to find a nice place.
474.979	It wasn't our preference,
474.979	but it was secure and it was clean.
479.715	And so we had a great sleep that night.
482.537	The piece that's important about that
484.356	is that we had similar
484.356	kinds of experiences
487.468	from Idaho all the way through 
487.468	to Pennsylvania,
490.65	where we were rejected from hotels, 
490.65	motels and restaurants.
494.951	But we made it to Pennsylvania.
497.151	We got the family settled.
497.151	Everyone was glad to see the kids.
501.711	I jumped on a plane and shot off
501.711	to Goose Bay, Labrador,
506.286	which is another story, right?
507.947	(Laughter)
510.234	Here it is, 53 years later,
514.657	I now have nine grandchildren, 
514.657	two great-grandchildren.
519.086	Five of the grandchildren are boys.
521.863	I have master's, Ph.D., undergrad,
521.863	one in medical school.
527.076	I have a couple that are trending.
529.69	They're almost there but not quite.
529.69	(Laughter)
532.455	I have one who has been 
532.455	in college now for eight years.
535.555	(Laughter)
536.975	He doesn't have a degree yet, 
536.975	but he wants to be a comedian.
540.346	So we're just trying to get him
540.346	to stay in school.
543.464	Because you never know,
544.994	just because you're funny at home,
544.994	does not make you a comedian, right?
548.894	(Laughter)
550.646	But the thing about it, 
550.646	they're all good kids --
553.078	no drugs, no babies 
553.078	in high school, no crime.
557.338	So with that being the backdrop,
559.896	I was sitting in my TV room watching TV,
562.117	and they were talking about Ferguson
562.117	and all the hullabaloo that was going on.
566.67	And all of a sudden, one of the news 
566.67	commentators got on the air and she said,
572.141	"""In the last three months,"
574.939	eight unarmed African-American males
578.808	have been killed by police,
578.808	"white homeowners, or white citizens."""
586.777	For some reason, at that moment
586.777	it just all hit me.
589.495	"I said, ""What is it? It is so insane."
593.487	What is the hatred that's causing people 
593.487	"to do these kinds of things?"""
598.625	Just then, one of my grandsons called.
601.073	"He said, ""Granddad, did you hear"
601.073	"what they said on TV?"""
604.312	"I said, ""Yes, I did."""
605.77	"He said, ""I'm just so confused."
607.524	We do everything we do,
607.524	but it seems that driving while black,
612.094	walking while black, talking while black,
612.094	it's just dangerous.
616.494	What can we do? We do everything
616.494	that you told us to do.
621.373	When stopped by the police,
623.163	we place both hands on the steering wheel
623.163	at the 12 o'clock position.
627.14	If asked to get identification,
629.767	we tell them, 'I am slowly reaching over 
629.767	into the glove compartment to get my I.D.'
635.675	When pulled out of the car to be searched,
638.44	when laid on the ground to be searched,
640.589	when our trunks are opened to be searched,
642.731	we don't push back, we don't challenge
642.731	because we know, you've told us,
646.991	'Don't you challenge the police.
649.03	After it's over, call us and we'll
649.03	"be the ones to challenge."""
652.638	"He said, ""And this is the piece "
652.638	that really bugs me:
655.37	Our white friends, our buddies,
655.37	we kind of hang together.
658.988	When they hear about these kinds
658.988	of things happening to us, they say,
662.225	'Why do you take it?
664.413	You need to push back.
664.413	You need to challenge.
667.392	You need to ask them 
667.392	"for their identification.'"""
670.154	And here's what the boys have been
670.154	taught to tell them:
672.761	"""We know that you can do that,"
672.761	but please do not do that
675.987	while we're in the car
678.026	because the consequences for you
678.026	are significantly different
681.813	"than the consequences for us."""
683.862	And so as a grandparent, 
683.862	what do I tell my grandsons?
687.36	How do I keep them safe?
687.36	How do I keep them alive?
690.706	As a result of this, people have
690.706	come to me and said, 
693.227	"""Jim, are you angry?"""
697.498	And my response to that is this:
700.619	"""I don't have the luxury of being angry,"
706.065	and I also know the consequences 
706.065	"of being enraged."""
711.075	So therefore, the only thing that I can do
713.168	is take my collective intellect and my
713.168	energy and my ideas and my experiences
719.456	and dedicate myself to challenge, 
719.456	at any point in time,
723.445	anything that looks 
723.445	like it might be racist.
726.326	So the first thing I have 
726.326	to do is to educate,
729.059	the second thing I have to do 
729.059	is to unveil racism,
732.327	and the last thing I need to do
732.327	is do everything within my power
735.727	to eradicate racism in my lifetime
735.727	by any means necessary.
742.864	The second thing I do is this:
745.29	I want to appeal to Americans.
748.976	I want to appeal to their humanity,
748.976	to their dignity,
753.42	to their civic pride and ownership
757.887	to be able to not react to these 
757.887	heinous crimes in an adverse manner.
765.952	But instead, to elevate your level
765.952	of societal knowledge,
772.061	your level of societal awareness
772.061	and societal consciousness
776.465	to then collectively come together,
776.465	all of us come together,
780.484	to make sure that we speak out against
780.484	and we challenge any kind of insanity,
787.552	any kind of insanity that makes it 
787.552	okay to kill unarmed people,
794.753	regardless of their ethnicity,
797.335	regardless of their race,
799.438	regardless of their diversity makeup.
801.925	We have to challenge that.
801.925	It doesn't make any sense.
805.185	The only way I think we can do that
805.185	is through a collective.
809.014	We need to have black and white 
809.014	and Asian and Hispanic
812.914	just to step forward and say,
814.614	"""We are not going to accept "
814.614	"that kind of behavior anymore."""
