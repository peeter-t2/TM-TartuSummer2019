25	What I am always thinking about
28	is what this session is about, which is called simplicity.
32	And almost, I would almost call it being simple-minded,
36	but in the best sense of the word.
38	I'm trying to figure out two very simple things:
42	how to live and how to die, period.
44	That's all I'm trying to do, all day long.
46	And I'm also trying to have some meals, and have some snacks,
49	and, you know, and yell at my children, and do all the normal things
53	that keep you grounded.
56	So, I was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child.
63	My older sister was busy torturing my parents,
67	and they were busy torturing her.
69	I was lucky enough to be completely ignored,
72	which is a fabulous thing, actually, I want to tell you.
74	So, I was able to completely daydream my way through my life.
80	And I finally daydreamed my way into NYU, at a very good time, in 1967,
87	where I met a man who was trying to blow up the math building of NYU.
93	And I was writing terrible poetry and knitting sweaters for him.
97	And feminists hated us, and the whole thing was wretched
102	from beginning to end.
104	But I kept writing bad poetry, and he didn't blow up the math building,
108	but he went to Cuba.
109	But I gave him the money, because I was from Riverdale
111	so I had more money than he did.
113	(Laughter)
114	And that was a good thing to help, you know, the cause.
118	But, then he came back, and things happened,
122	and I decided I really hated my writing,
125	that it was awful, awful, purple prose.
129	And I decided that I wanted to tell --
131	but I still wanted to tell a narrative story
133	and I still wanted to tell my stories.
135	So I decided that I would start to draw. How hard could that be?
138	And so what happened was that I started
143	just becoming an editorial illustrator through, you know,
146	sheer whatever, sheer ignorance.
149	And we started a studio.
151	Well, Tibor really started the studio, called M&amp;Co.
153	And the premise of M&amp;Co was, we don't know anything,
157	but that's all right, we're going to do it anyway.
159	And as a matter of fact, it's better not to know anything,
161	because if you know too much, you're stymied.
164	So, the premise in the studio was,
167	there are no boundaries, there is no fear.
170	And I -- and my full-time job, I landed the best job on Earth,
173	was to daydream, and to actually come up with absurd ideas
178	that -- fortunately, there were enough people there,
180	and it was a team, it was a collective,
182	it was not just me coming up with crazy ideas.
184	But the point was that I was there as myself, as a dreamer.
189	And so some of the things -- I mean, it was a long history of M&amp;Co,
192	and clearly we also needed to make some money,
196	so we decided we would create a series of products.
200	And some of the watches there,
203	attempting to be beautiful and humorous --
205	maybe not attempting, hopefully succeeding.
208	That to be able to talk about content,
211	to break apart what you normally expect, to use humor and surprise,
215	elegance and humanity in your work was really important to us.
220	It was a very high, it was a very impersonal time in design
225	and we wanted to say, the content is what's important,
229	not the package, not the wrapping.
231	You really have to be journalists, you have to be inventors,
234	you have to use your imagination more importantly than anything.
238	So, the good news is that I have a dog
243	and, though I don't know if I believe in luck --
245	I don't know what I believe in, it's a very complicated question,
247	but I do know that before I go away, I crank his tail seven times.
251	So, whenever he sees a suitcase in the house,
253	because everybody's always, you know, leaving,
256	they're always cranking this wonderful dog's tail,
258	and he runs to the other room.
260	But I am able to make the transition from working for children and --
265	from working for adults to children, and back and forth,
268	because, you know, I can say that I'm immature,
270	and in a way, that's true.
273	I don't really -- I mean, I could tell you that I didn't understand,
278	I'm not proud of it, but I didn't understand
280	let's say 95 percent of the talks at this conference.
283	But I have been taking beautiful notes of drawings
285	and I have a gorgeous onion from Murray Gell-Mann's talk.
288	And I have a beautiful page of doodles from Jonathan Woodham's talk.
292	So, good things come out of, you know, incomprehension --
295	(Laughter)
297	-- which I will do a painting of, and then it will end up in my work.
300	So, I'm open to the possibilities of not knowing
304	and finding out something new.
306	So, in writing for children, it seems simple, and it is.
311	You have to condense a story into 32 pages, usually.
315	And what you have to do is, you really have to edit down to what you want to say.
318	And hopefully, you're not talking down to kids
321	and you're not talking in such a way that you,
323	you know, couldn't stand reading it after one time.
326	So, I hopefully am writing, you know,
328	books that are good for children and for adults.
330	But the painting reflects --
332	I don't think differently for children than I do for adults.
334	I try to use the same kind of imagination, the same kind of whimsy,
337	the same kind of love of language.
340	So, you know, and I have lots of wonderful-looking friends.
344	This is Andrew Gatz, and he walked in through the door and I said,
346	"""You! Sit down there."" You know, I take lots of photos."
349	And the Bertoia chair in the background is my favorite chair.
352	So, I get to put in all of the things that I love.
355	Hopefully, a dialog between adults and children will happen on many different levels,
359	and hopefully different kinds of humor will evolve.
363	And the books are really journals of my life.
365	I never -- I don't like plots.
367	I don't know what a plot means.
369	I can't stand the idea of anything that starts in the beginning,
372	you know, beginning, middle and end. It really scares me,
374	because my life is too random and too confused,
377	and I enjoy it that way.
378	But anyway, so we were in Venice,
383	and this is our room. And I had this dream
385	that I was wearing this fantastic green gown,
387	and I was looking out the window,
389	and it was really a beautiful thing.
391	And so, I was able to put that into this story, which is an alphabet,
394	and hopefully go on to something else.
397	The letter C had other things in it.
399	I was fortunate also, to meet the man who's sitting on the bed,
402	though I gave him hair over here and he doesn't have hair.
405	Well, he has some hair but -- well, he used to have hair.
408	And with him, I was able to do a project that was really fantastic.
413	I work for the New Yorker, and I do covers, and 9/11 happened
418	and it was, you know, a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it.
423	And Rick and I were on our way to a party in the Bronx,
427	and somebody said Bronxistan,
429	and somebody said Ferreristan,
430	and we came up with this New Yorker cover,
433	which we were able to -- we didn't know what we were doing.
435	We weren't trying to be funny, we weren't trying to be --
438	well, we were trying to be funny actually, that's not true.
440	We hoped we'd be funny, but we didn't know it would be a cover,
443	and we didn't know that that image, at the moment that it happened,
447	would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people.
451	And it really became the -- I don't know, you know,
453	it was one of those moments people started laughing at what was going on.
456	And from, you know, Fattushis, to Taxistan to, you know,
461	for the Fashtoonks, Botoxia, Pashmina, Khlintunisia, you know,
465	we were able to take the city
467	and make fun of this completely foreign, who are -- what's going on over here?
471	Who are these people? What are these tribes?
474	And David Remnick, who was really wonderful about it,
477	had one problem. He didn't like Al Zheimers,
482	because he thought it would insult people with Alzheimer's.
485	"But you know, we said, ""David, who's going to know?"
487	"They're not."""
489	(Laughter)
491	So it stayed in, and it was, and, you know, it was a good thing.
499	You know, in the course of my life, I never know what's going to happen
502	and that's kind of the beauty part.
504	And we were on Cape Cod, a place, obviously, of great inspiration,
508	"and I picked up this book, ""The Elements of Style,"" at a yard sale."
512	And I didn't -- and I'd never used it in school,
514	because I was too busy writing poems, and flunking out,
517	and I don't know what, sitting in cafes.
519	But I picked it up and I started reading it and I thought, this book is amazing.
522	I said, people should know about this book.
525	(Laughter)
528	So I decided it needed a few -- it needed a lift, it needed a few illustrations.
531	And basically, I called the, you know, I convinced the White Estate,
535	and what an intersection of like, you know,
537	Polish Jew, you know, main WASP family. Here I am, saying,
543	I'd like to do something to this book.
545	And they said yes, and they left me completely alone,
547	which was a gorgeous, wonderful thing.
550	And I took the examples that they gave,
554	and just did 56 paintings, basically.
556	So, this is, I don't know if you can read this.
558	"""Well, Susan, this is a fine mess you are in."""
560	And when you're dealing with grammar,
562	which is, you know, incredibly dry,
564	E.B. White wrote such wonderful, whimsical -- and actually, Strunk --
568	and then you come to the rules and, you know,
570	"there are lots of grammar things. ""Do you mind me asking a question?"
573	"Do you mind my asking a question?"""
576	"""Would, could, should, or would, should, could."""
578	"And ""would"" is Coco Chanel's lover, ""should"" is Edith Sitwell,"
582	"and ""could"" is an August Sander subject."
585	"And, ""He noticed a large stain in the center of the rug."""
587	(Laughter)
589	So, there's a kind of British understatement, murder-mystery theme
592	that I really love very much.
594	"And then, ""Be obscure clearly! Be wild of tongue in a way we can understand."""
598	E.B. White wrote us a number of rules,
600	which can either paralyze you and make you loathe him
602	for the rest of time, or you can ignore them, which I do,
607	or you can, I don't know what, you know, eat a sandwich.
610	So, what I did when I was painting was I started singing,
613	because I really adore singing,
615	and I think that music is the highest form of all art.
618	So, I commissioned a wonderful composer, Nico Muhly,
621	who wrote nine songs using the text,
625	and we performed this fantastic evening of --
629	he wrote music for both amateurs and professionals.
632	I played the clattering teacup and the slinky
634	in the main reading room of the New York Public Library,
637	where you're supposed to be very, very quiet,
639	and it was a phenomenally wonderful event,
641	which we hopefully will do some more.
645	Who knows? The New York TimesSelect, the op-ed page,
649	asked me to do a column, and they said, you can do whatever you want.
652	So, once a month for the last year,
653	"I've been doing a column called ""The Principles of Uncertainty,"""
657	which, you know, I don't know who Heisenberg is,
659	but I know I can throw that around now. You know,
661	it's the principles of uncertainty, so, you know.
664	I'm going to read quickly -- and probably I'm going to edit some,
667	because I don't have that much time left -- a few of the columns.
670	And basically, I was so, you know, it was so amusing,
673	"because I said, ""Well, how much space do I have?"""
674	"And they said, ""Well, you know, it's the Internet."""
676	"And I said, ""Yes, but how much space do I have?"""
678	"And they said, ""It's unlimited, it's unlimited."""
680	OK. So, the first one I was very timid, and I'll begin.
685	"""How can I tell you everything that is in my heart?"
687	"Impossible to begin. Enough. No. Begin with the hapless dodo."""
690	And I talk about the dodo, and how the dodo became extinct,
694	and then I talk about Spinoza.
696	"""As the last dodo was dying, Spinoza was looking for a rational explanation"
700	for everything, called eudaemonia.
702	And then he breathed his last, with loved ones around him,
705	"and I know that he had chicken soup also, as his last meal."""
707	I happen to know it for a fact.
709	And then he died, and there was no more Spinoza. Extinct.
713	And then, we don't have a stuffed Spinoza,
715	but we do have a stuffed Pavlov's dog,
717	and I visited him in the Museum of Hygiene in St. Petersburg, in Russia.
721	And there he is, with this horrible electrical box on his rump
726	in this fantastic, decrepit palace.
730	"""And I think it must have been a very, very dark day"
732	when the Bolsheviks arrived.
733	Maybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs,
735	"but Stalin was a paranoid man, even more than my father."""
739	(Laughter)
740	You don't even know.
741	"""And decided his top people had to be extinctified."""
746	Which I think I made up, which is a good thing.
748	And so, this is a chart of, you know, just a small chart,
751	because the chart would go on forever of all the people that he killed.
753	So, shot dead, smacked over the head, you know, thrown away.
759	"""Nabokov's family fled Russia. How could the young Nabokov,"
762	sitting innocently and elegantly in a red chair,
764	leafing through a book and butterflies,
766	"imagine such displacement, such loss?"""
770	And then I want to tell you that this is a map.
772	"So, ""My beautiful mother's family fled Russia as well."
776	Too many pogroms.
778	Leaving the shack, the wild blueberry woods, the geese, the River Sluch,
781	"they went to Palestine and then America."""
784	And my mother drew this map for me of the United States of America,
786	and that is my DNA over here, because that person who I grew up with
795	had no use for facts whatsoever.
797	Facts were actually banished from our home.
800	And so, if you see that Texas -- you know, Texas and California
804	are under Canada, and that South Carolina is on top of North Carolina,
807	this is the home that I grew up in, OK?
809	So, it's a miracle that I'm here today.
811	But actually, it's not. It's actually a wonderful thing.
815	But then she says Tel Aviv and Lenin,
817	"which is the town they came from, and, ""Sorry, the rest unknown, thank you."""
820	"But in her lexicon, ""sorry, the rest unknown, thank you"" is"
822	"""sorry, the rest unknown, go to hell,"""
824	because she couldn't care less.
825	(Laughter)
826	"""The Impossibility of February"""
828	is that February's a really wretched month in New York
831	and the images for me conjure up these really awful things.
834	Well, not so awful.
836	I received a box in the mail and it was wrapped with newspaper
839	and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead.
843	"And I say, ""I hope he's not really dead,"
845	just enjoying a refreshing lie-down in the snow,
847	"but the caption says he is dead."""
849	And actually, he was. I think he's dead, though I don't know,
852	maybe he's not dead.
854	"""And this woman leans over in anguish, not about that man,"
856	"but about all sad things. It happens quite often in February."""
861	There's consoling.
863	This man is angry because somebody threw onions all over the staircase,
867	and basically -- you know, I guess onions are a theme here.
870	"And he says, ""It is impossible not to lie."
872	"It is February and not lying is impossible."""
874	And I really spend a lot of time wondering,
876	how much truth do we tell?
878	What is it that we're actually -- what story are we actually telling?
881	How do we know when we are ourselves?
883	How do we actually know that these sentences coming out of our mouths
886	are real stories, you know, are real sentences?
888	Or are they fake sentences that we think we ought to be saying?
891	I'm going to quickly go through this.
894	A quote by Bertrand Russell,
896	"""All the labor of all the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration,"
900	all the noonday brightness of human genius
903	are destined to extinction.
905	So now, my friends, if that is true,
907	"and it is true, what is the point?"""
910	A complicated question.
911	And so, you know, I talk to my friends
914	and I go to plays where they're singing Russian songs.
917	Oh my God, you know what?
919	Could we have -- no, we don't have time.
921	I taped my aunt. I taped my aunt singing a song in Russian from the --
923	you know, could we have it for a second?
926	Do you have that?
928	(Music)
947	OK. I taped my -- my aunt used to swim in the ocean
950	every day of the year until she was about 85.
957	So -- and that's a song about how everybody's miserable
959	because, you know, we're from Russia.
961	(Laughter)
962	I went to visit Kitty Carlisle Hart, and she is 96,
964	"and when I brought her a copy of ""The Elements of Style,"""
967	she said she would treasure it.
969	And then I said -- oh, and she was talking about Moss Hart, and I said,
971	"""When you met him, you knew it was him."""
973	"And she said, ""I knew it was he."""
974	(Laughter)
977	So, I was the one who should have kept the book, but it was a really wonderful moment.
980	And she dated George Gershwin, so, you know, get out.
983	Gershwin died at the age of 38.
986	He's buried in the same cemetery as my husband.
989	I don't want to talk about that now.
991	I do want to talk -- the absolute icing on this cemetery cake
993	is the Barricini family mausoleum nearby.
996	I think the Barricini family should open a store there and sell chocolate.
999	(Laughter)
1000	And I would like to run it for them.
1001	And I went to visit Louise Bourgeoise,
1003	who's also still working, and I looked at her sink,
1005	which is really amazing, and left.
1007	And then I photograph and do a painting of a sofa on the street.
1010	And a woman who lives on our street, Lolita.
1013	And then I go and have some tea.
1015	And then my Aunt Frances dies, and before she died,
1018	she tried to pay with Sweet'N Low packets for her bagel.
1021	(Laughter)
1023	And I wonder what the point is and then I know, and I see
1025	that Hy Meyerowitz, Rick Meyerowitz's father,
1027	a dry-cleaning supply salesman from the Bronx,
1029	won the Charlie Chaplin look-alike contest in 1931.
1034	That's actually Hy.
1036	And I look at a beautiful bowl of fruit,
1039	and I look at a dress that I sewed for friends of mine.
1042	"And it says, ""Ich habe genug,"" which is a Bach cantata,"
1044	"which I once thought meant ""I've had it, I can't take it anymore,"
1047	"give me a break,"" but I was wrong."
1050	"It means ""I have enough."" And that is utterly true."
1053	I happen to be alive, end of discussion. Thank you.
1055	(Applause)
