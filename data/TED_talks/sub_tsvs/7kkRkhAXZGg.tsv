12.7	Today, I want to tell you
12.7	about a pressing social issue.
16.54	Now, it's not nuclear arms,
18.9	it's not immigration,
20.5	and it's not malaria.
22.46	I'm here to talk about movies.
25.94	Now, in all seriousness,
25.94	movies are actually really important.
30.3	In film, we can be wildly entertained,
34.5	and we can also be transported
34.5	through storytelling.
39.3	Storytelling is so important.
41.14	Stories tell us what societies value,
44.7	they offer us lessons,
46.7	and they share and preserve our history.
49.9	Stories are amazing.
52.26	But stories don't give everyone
55.22	the same opportunity
55.22	to appear within them,
59.7	particularly not stories
62.18	compartmentalized
62.18	in the form of American movies.
66.34	In film, interestingly enough,
68.66	females are still erased and marginalized
72.26	in a lot of our stories.
74.34	And I learned this for the first time
74.34	about 10 years ago
77.22	when I did my first study
77.22	on gender role in G-rated films.
81.02	Since then, we've conducted
81.02	more than 30 investigations.
84.62	My team is tired.
86.5	And I've committed my life
89.9	as researcher and activist
92.42	to fighting the inclusion crisis
95.14	in Hollywood.
97.02	So today, what I'd like to do
97.02	is tell you about that crisis.
100.54	I want to talk about
100.54	gender inequality in film.
103.14	I want to tell you how it is perpetuated,
105.54	and then I'm going to tell you
105.54	how we're going to fix it.
109.58	However, one caveat before I begin:
113.42	my data are really depressing.
116.78	So I want to apologize in advance,
118.86	because I'm going to put you all
118.86	in a really bad mood.
122.02	But I'm going to bring it up at the end,
125.42	and I'm going to present a silver lining
128.3	to fix this mess that we've been in
130.7	for a very, very long time.
133.3	So, let's start with the gravity
133.3	of the situation.
137.26	Each year, my research team
137.26	examines the top 100 grossing films
140.9	in the United States.
142.54	What we do is we look at every speaking
142.54	or named character on-screen.
146.78	Now, to count in one of my investigations,
149.74	all a character has to do is say one word.
153.94	This is a very low bar.
156.54	(Laughter)
158.02	Thus far, we've looked at 800 movies,
160.46	from 2007 to 2015,
162.5	cataloguing every speaking character
162.5	on-screen for gender, race, ethnicity,
167.38	LGBT and characters with a disability.
171.74	Let's take a look
171.74	at really some problematic trends.
175.62	First, females are still
175.62	noticeably absent on-screen in film.
180.22	Across 800 movies
180.22	and 35,205 speaking characters,
184.58	less than a third of all roles
184.58	go to girls and women.
188.3	Less than a third!
189.62	There's been no change from 2007 to 2015,
193.1	and if you compare our results
194.553	to a small sample of films
194.553	from 1946 to 1955,
199.22	there's been no change
199.22	in over a half of a century.
203.54	Over half of a century!
204.94	But we're half of the population.
207.58	Now, if we look at this data
207.58	intersectionally,
210.42	which has been a focus of today,
212.58	the picture becomes even more problematic.
215.7	Across the top 100 films
215.7	of just last year,
	or African-American speaking character,
223.06	not one.
	or Asian-American speaking characters
228.58	that were girls or women.
230.02	None.
231.66	Eighty-four films didn't feature one
231.66	female character that had a disability.
236.06	And 93 were devoid of lesbian, bisexual
236.06	or transgender female speaking characters.
242.66	This is not underrepresentation.
245.86	This is erasure,
247.78	and I call this
247.78	the epidemic of invisibility.
252.62	Now, when we move
252.62	from prevalence to protagonist,
256.34	the story is still problematic.
258.82	Out of a hundred films last year,
260.46	only 32 featured a female lead
260.46	or colead driving the action.
265.1	Only three out of a hundred films
267.26	featured an underrepresented
267.26	female driving the story,
271.06	and only one diverse woman
273.38	that was 45 years of age or older
273.38	at the time of theatrical release.
278.14	Now let's look at portrayal.
280.74	In addition to the numbers you just saw,
282.7	females are far more likely
282.7	to be sexualized in film
286.34	than their male counterparts.
288.1	Matter of fact, they're about
288.1	three times as likely
290.54	to be shown in sexually
290.54	revealing clothing,
292.58	partially naked,
293.82	and they're far more likely to be thin.
296.42	Now, sometimes, in animation,
296.42	females are so thin
300.18	that their waist size approximates
300.18	the circumference of their upper arm.
304.86	(Laughter)
306.54	We like to say that these gals
306.54	have no room for a womb
309.98	or any other internal organ.
312.58	(Laughter)
314.62	Now, all joking aside,
316.22	theories suggest, research confirms,
318.18	exposure to thin ideals
318.18	and objectifying content
320.58	can lead to body dissatisfaction,
320.58	internalization of the thin ideal
324.42	and self-objectification
324.42	among some female viewers.
328.86	Obviously, what we see on-screen
330.86	and what we see in the world,
332.86	they do not match.
334.62	They do not match!
335.9	Matter of fact,
335.9	if we lived in the screen world,
338.18	we would have a population
338.18	crisis on our hands.
342.62	So, as soon as I recognized
342.62	these patterns,
344.7	I wanted to find out why,
345.98	and it turns out that there are
345.98	two drivers to inequality on-screen:
349.9	content creator gender
349.9	and misperceptions of the audience.
353.02	Let's unpack them really quick.
354.78	If you want to change
354.78	any of the patterns I just talked about,
357.74	all you have to do
357.74	is hire female directors.
360.22	Turns out, the female directors
362.26	are associated with,
362.26	in terms of short films and indie films,
366.78	more girls and women on-screen,
368.62	more stories with women in the center,
371.26	more stories with women
375.82	which I think is good news for this crowd.
378.74	More underrepresented --
380.7	(Laughter)
382.06	Sorry.
383.3	(Laughter)
385.1	Sorry but not sorry.
386.38	More underrepresented characters
386.38	in terms of race and ethnicity,
390.06	and most importantly,
391.38	more women working behind the camera
393.78	in key production roles.
395.9	Easy answer to the problems
395.9	that we just talked about.
399.66	Or is it?
400.9	It's actually not.
407.58	Only 4.1 percent are women.
411.22	Only three are African-American or black,
414.14	and only one woman was Asian.
417.34	So why is it so difficult
420.86	to have female directors
422.66	if they're part of the solution?
425.34	Well, to answer this question,
427.14	we conducted a study.
428.94	We interviewed dozens of industry insiders
431.26	and asked them about directors.
433.7	Turns out, both male
433.7	and female executives,
437.54	when they think director,
439.22	they think male.
440.82	They perceive the traits of leadership
443.7	to be masculine in nature.
445.98	So when they're going to hire a director
449.18	to command a crew, lead a ship,
451.5	be a visionary or be General Patton,
453.9	all the things that we've heard --
456.18	their thoughts and ideations pull male.
459.66	The perception of director or a leader
462.14	is inconsistent
462.14	with the perception of a woman.
465.82	The roles are incongruous,
467.86	which is consistent with a lot of research
467.86	in the psychological arena.
472.02	Second factor contributing
472.02	to inequality on-screen
475.18	is misperceptions of the audience.
477.78	I don't need to tell this crowd:
	that go to the box office and buy tickets
482.74	are girls and women in this country.
484.74	Right?
485.98	But we're not perceived to be a viable
485.98	or financially lucrative target audience.
491.34	Further, there's some misperceptions
493.58	about whether females can open a film.
496.7	Open a film means that if you
496.7	place a female at the center,
499.58	it doesn't have the return on investment
501.54	that if you place a male
501.54	at the center of a story does.
505.26	This misperception is actually costly.
508.94	Right?
510.18	Especially in the wake
510.18	of franchise successes
512.5	"like ""The Hunger Games,"""
514.62	"""Pitch Perfect"""
515.86	or that small little indie film,
515.86	"""Star Wars: The Force Awakens."""
521.66	Our own economic analyses show
521.66	that gender of the lead character
525.06	doesn't play a role in economic success
525.06	in the United States.
528.58	But what does?
529.9	Production costs alone
531.78	or in conjunction with how widely
531.78	a film is distributed in this country.
538.22	It's not the gender of the lead character.
540.78	So at this point, we should
540.78	all be sufficiently depressed.
545.18	No change in 50 years,
546.74	few female directors
546.74	working behind the camera
549.14	and the entertainment industry
549.14	does not trust us as an audience.
554.06	Well, I told you
554.06	there would be a silver lining,
556.46	and there is.
558.5	There are actually
558.5	simple and tangible solutions
561.82	to fixing this problem
563.38	that involve content creators,
565.02	executives and consumers
567.26	like the individuals in this room.
569.62	Let's talk about a few of them.
571.54	"The first is what I call ""just add five."""
574.02	Did you know if we looked
574.02	at the top 100 films next year
577.1	and simply added five female
577.1	speaking characters on-screen
580.34	to each of those films,
581.78	it would create a new norm.
583.42	If we were to do this
583.42	for three contiguous years,
586.22	we would be at gender parity
588.26	for the first time
588.26	in over a half of a century.
593.46	Now, this approach is advantageous
593.46	for a variety of reasons.
596.74	One? It doesn't take away jobs
596.74	for male actors.
600.7	Heaven forbid.
602.06	(Laughter)
604.5	Two, it's actually cost-effective.
604.5	It doesn't cost that much.
608.46	Three, it builds a pipeline for talent.
610.38	And four, it humanizes
610.38	the production process.
613.02	Why? Because it makes sure
613.02	that there's women on set.
617.18	Second solution is for A-list talent.
620.62	A-listers, as we all know,
620.62	can make demands in their contracts,
624.22	particularly the ones that work
624.22	on the biggest Hollywood films.
627.94	What if those A-listers
629.7	simply added an equity clause
629.7	or an inclusion rider
633.82	into their contract?
635.9	Now, what does that mean?
637.86	Well, you probably don't know
639.58	but the typical feature film
640.94	has about 40 to 45
640.94	speaking characters in it.
644.34	I would argue that only 8 to 10
644.34	of those characters
647.78	are actually relevant to the story.
650.82	"Except maybe ""Avengers."" Right?"
652.86	"A few more in ""Avengers."""
655.5	The remaining 30 or so roles,
657.9	there's no reason why those minor roles
660.34	can't match or reflect the demography
663.26	of where the story is taking place.
666.94	An equity rider by an A-lister
666.94	in their contract
670.54	can stipulate that those roles
672.98	reflect the world
672.98	in which we actually live.
676.3	Now, there's no reason why a network,
678.86	a studio or a production company
681.06	cannot adopt the same contractual language
684.7	in their negotiation processes.
687.54	Third solution:
689.22	this would be for
689.22	the entertainment industry,
691.58	Hollywood in particular,
692.82	to adopt the Rooney Rule
695.78	when it comes to hiring practices
695.78	around directors.
699.46	Now, in the NFL,
699.46	the Rooney Rule stipulates
702.1	that if a team wants to hire a coach
702.1	from outside the organization,
705.98	what they have to do is interview
705.98	an underrepresented candidate.
709.94	The exact same principle
709.94	can apply to Hollywood films.
714.06	How?
715.3	Well, on these top films,
716.78	executives and agents can make sure
720.26	that women and people of color
720.26	are not only on the consideration list,
725.5	but they're actually
725.5	interviewed for the job.
728.9	Now, one might say,
730.42	why is this important?
731.86	Because it exposes or introduces
731.86	executives to female directors
737.1	who otherwise fall prey
737.1	to exclusionary hiring practices.
742.26	The fourth solution
743.74	is for consumers like me and you.
747.1	If we want to see more films
747.1	by, for and about women,
750.1	we have to support them.
752.3	It may mean going
752.3	to the independent theater chain
754.82	instead of the multiplex.
756.78	Or it might mean scrolling down
756.78	a little further online
760.3	to find a film by a female director.
762.9	Or it may be writing a check
762.9	and funding a film,
765.78	particularly by a female director
765.78	from an underrepresented background.
770.3	Right?
771.54	We need to write, call and email companies
774.22	that are making and distributing films,
776.102	and we need to post
776.102	on our social media accounts
779.02	when we want to see
779.02	inclusive representation,
782.14	women on-screen,
783.42	and most importantly,
783.42	women behind the camera.
787.34	We need to make our voices heard
787.34	and our dollars count.
793.22	Now, we actually have the ability
793.22	to change the world on this one.
799.46	The US and its content,
801.94	films in particular,
803.46	have captured the imaginations
803.46	of audiences worldwide.
808.5	Worldwide.
810.66	So that means that the film industry
810.66	has unprecedented access
815.06	to be able to distribute
815.06	stories about equality
820.1	all around the world.
822.34	Imagine what would happen
824.26	if the film industry aligned its values
827.82	with what it shows on-screen.
830.1	It could foster inclusion
832.22	and acceptance for girls and women,
835.5	people of color,
837.02	the LGBT community,
838.9	individuals with disabilities,
840.7	and so many more around the world.
845.34	The only thing that the film industry
845.34	has to do is unleash its secret weapon,
851.9	and that's storytelling.
855.14	Now, at the beginning of this talk,
857.54	I said that films --
859.98	that they can actually transport us,
862.54	but I would like to argue
862.54	that films, they can transform us.
868.58	None of us in this room
870.5	have grown up or experienced
870.5	a storytelling landscape
874.78	with fully realized female characters,
878.3	none of us,
879.82	because the numbers haven't changed.
882.58	What would happen
882.58	if the next generation of audiences
886.7	grew up with a whole
886.7	different screen reality?
891.1	What would happen?
892.38	Well I'm here to tell you today
894.38	that it's not only possible
894.38	to change what we see on-screen
898.46	but I am impatient for it to get here.
903.22	So let's agree to take action today
907.54	to eradicate the epidemic of invisibility.
911.78	And let's agree to take action today
914.1	to agree that US audiences
914.1	and global viewers
918.54	demand and deserve more.
921.7	And let's agree today
924.3	that the next generation
924.3	of viewers and audiences,
929.5	that they deserve to see the stories
932.7	we were never able to see.
935.86	Thank you.
937.1	(Applause)
