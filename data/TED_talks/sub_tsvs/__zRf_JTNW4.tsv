15.26	Come with me to the bottom of the world,
18.26	Antarctica,
20.26	the highest, driest, windiest,
22.26	and yes, coldest region on Earth --
25.26	more arid than the Sahara
27.26	and, in parts, colder than Mars.
29.26	The ice of Antarctica glows
31.26	with a light so dazzling,
33.26	it blinds the unprotected eye.
35.26	Early explorers rubbed cocaine in their eyes
37.26	to kill the pain of it.
39.26	The weight of the ice is such that the entire continent
42.26	sags below sea level, beneath its weight.
45.26	Yet, the ice of Antarctica
47.26	is a calendar of climate change.
49.26	It records the annual rise and fall
51.26	of greenhouse gases and temperatures
53.26	going back before the onset of the last ice ages.
56.26	Nowhere on Earth
58.26	offers us such a perfect record.
61.26	And here, scientists are drilling
63.26	into the past of our planet
65.26	to find clues to the future
67.26	of climate change.
69.26	This past January,
71.26	I traveled to a place called WAIS Divide,
73.26	about 600 miles from the South Pole.
75.26	It is the best place on the planet, many say,
78.26	to study the history of climate change.
80.26	There, about 45 scientists from the University of Wisconsin,
83.26	the Desert Research Institute in Nevada and others
86.26	have been working to answer a central question
88.26	about global warming.
90.26	What is the exact relationship
92.26	between levels of greenhouse gases
95.26	and planetary temperatures?
97.26	It's urgent work. We know that temperatures are rising.
100.26	This past May was the warmest worldwide on record.
103.26	And we know that levels of greenhouse gases are rising too.
106.26	What we don't know
108.26	is the exact, precise, immediate
110.26	impact of these changes
112.26	on natural climate patterns --
114.26	winds, ocean currents,
116.26	precipitation rates, cloud formation,
119.26	things that bear on the health and well-being
121.26	of billions of people.
124.26	Their entire camp, every item of gear,
127.26	was ferried 885 miles
129.26	from McMurdo Station,
131.26	the main U.S. supply base
133.26	on the coast of Antarctica.
135.26	WAIS Divide itself though,
137.26	is a circle of tents in the snow.
140.26	In blizzard winds, the crew sling ropes between the tents
143.26	so that people can feel their way safely
146.26	to the nearest ice house
148.26	and to the nearest outhouse.
150.26	It snows so heavily there,
152.26	the installation was almost immediately buried.
154.26	Indeed, the researchers picked this site
157.26	because ice and snow accumulates here
162.26	They have to dig themselves out every day.
165.26	It makes for an exotic
167.26	and chilly commute.
169.26	(Laughter)
171.26	But under the surface
173.26	is a hive of industrial activity
176.26	centered around an eight-million-dollar drill assembly.
179.26	Periodically, this drill, like a biopsy needle,
182.26	plunges thousands of feet deep into the ice
185.26	to extract a marrow of gases
187.26	and isotopes for analysis.
190.26	Ten times a day, they extract
192.26	the 10-foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals
194.26	that contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals
197.26	laid down by snow,
199.26	season after season for thousands of years.
204.26	It's really a time machine.
206.26	At the peak of activity earlier this year,
209.26	the researchers lowered the drill
212.26	an extra hundred feet deeper into the ice every day
215.26	and another 365 years
217.26	deeper into the past.
220.26	Periodically, they remove
222.26	a cylinder of ice,
224.26	like gamekeepers popping a spent shotgun shell
226.26	from the barrel of a drill.
230.26	They inspect it, they check it for cracks,
232.26	for drill damage, for spalls, for chips.
236.26	More importantly,
238.26	they prepare it for inspection and analysis
240.26	by 27 independent laboratories
242.26	in the United States and Europe,
244.26	who will examine it for 40 different trace chemicals
246.26	related to climate,
248.26	some in parts per quadrillion.
251.26	Yes, I said that with a Q, quadrillion.
254.26	They cut the cylinders up into three-foot sections
256.26	for easier handling and shipment
258.26	back to these labs,
260.26	some 8,000 miles from the drill site.
263.26	Each cylinder
265.26	is a parfait of time.
268.26	This ice formed as snow
274.26	when our ancestors were daubing themselves with paint
277.26	and considering the radical new technology
280.26	of the alphabet.
283.26	Bathed in polarized light
285.26	and cut in cross-section,
287.26	this ancient ice reveals itself
289.26	as a mosaic of colors,
291.26	each one showing how conditions at depth in the ice
294.26	have affected this material
297.26	at depths where pressures can reach
300.26	a ton per square inch.
303.26	Every year, it begins with a snowflake,
306.26	and by digging into fresh snow,
308.26	we can see how this process is ongoing today.
311.26	This wall of undisturbed snow,
313.26	back-lit by sunlight,
315.26	shows the striations of winter and summer snow,
318.26	layer upon layer.
322.26	Each storm scours the atmosphere,
325.26	washing out dust, soot,
328.26	trace chemicals,
330.26	and depositing them on the snow pack
333.26	year after year,
335.26	millennia after millennia,
337.26	creating a kind of periodic table of elements
339.26	that at this point
341.26	is more than 11,000 feet thick.
344.26	From this, we can detect an extraordinary number of things.
349.26	We can see the calcium
351.26	from the world's deserts,
353.26	soot from distant wildfires,
355.26	methane as an indicator of the strength of a Pacific monsoon,
358.26	all wafted on winds from warmer latitudes
361.26	to this remote and very cold place.
364.26	Most importantly,
366.26	these cylinders and this snow
368.26	trap air.
370.26	Each cylinder is about 10 percent ancient air,
373.26	a pristine time capsule
375.26	of greenhouse gases -- carbon dioxide,
377.26	methane, nitrous oxide --
379.26	all unchanged from the day that snow formed
382.26	and first fell.
384.26	And this is the object of their scrutiny.
387.26	But don't we already know
389.26	what we need to know about greenhouse gases?
391.26	Why do we need to study this anymore?
393.26	Don't we already know how they affect temperatures?
395.26	Don't we already know the consequences
398.26	of a changing climate on our settled civilization?
401.26	The truth is, we only know the outlines,
404.26	and what we don't completely understand,
406.26	we can't properly fix.
408.26	Indeed, we run the risk of making things worse.
411.26	Consider, the single most successful
414.26	international environmental effort of the 20th century,
417.26	the Montreal Protocol,
419.26	in which the nations of Earth banded together to protect the planet
422.26	from the harmful effects of ozone-destroying chemicals
425.26	used at that time
427.26	in air conditioners, refrigerators and other cooling devices.
430.26	We banned those chemicals,
433.26	and we replaced them, unknowingly,
435.26	with other substances
437.26	that, molecule per molecule,
439.26	are a hundred times more potent
441.26	as heat-trapping, greenhouse gases
443.26	than carbon dioxide.
446.26	This process requires
448.26	extraordinary precautions.
451.26	The scientists must insure
453.26	that the ice is not contaminated.
455.26	Moreover, in this 8,000-mile journey,
457.26	they have to insure this ice doesn't melt.
459.26	Imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics.
463.26	They have to, in fact,
465.26	make sure this ice never gets warmer
467.26	than about 20 degrees below zero,
469.26	otherwise, the key gases inside it will dissipate.
472.26	So, in the coldest place on Earth,
475.26	they work inside a refrigerator.
478.26	As they handle the ice, in fact,
480.26	they keep an extra pair of gloves warming in an oven,
482.26	so that, when their work gloves freeze
484.26	and their fingers stiffen,
486.26	they can don a fresh pair.
488.26	They work against the clock and against the thermometer.
491.26	So far, they've packed up
493.26	about 4,500 feet of ice cores
497.26	for shipment back to the United States.
499.26	This past season,
501.26	they manhandled them across the ice
503.26	to waiting aircraft.
505.26	The 109th Air National Guard
508.26	flew the most recent shipment of ice
510.26	back to the coast of Antarctica,
512.26	where it was boarded onto a freighter,
515.26	shipped across the tropics to California,
518.26	unloaded, put on a truck,
520.26	driven across the desert
522.26	to the National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver, Colorado,
524.26	where, as we speak,
526.26	scientists are now slicing this material up
528.26	for samples, for analysis,
530.26	to be distributed
532.26	to the laboratories around the country
534.26	and in Europe.
537.26	Antarctica was this planet's
540.26	last empty quarter --
542.26	the blind spot
544.26	in our expanding vision of the world.
546.26	Early explorers
548.26	sailed off the edge of the map,
550.26	and they found a place
552.26	where the normal rules of time and temperature
554.26	seem suspended.
558.26	Here, the ice seems a living presence.
561.26	The wind that rubs against it
563.26	gives it voice.
566.26	It is a voice of experience.
569.26	It is a voice we should heed.
573.26	Thank you.
575.26	(Applause)
