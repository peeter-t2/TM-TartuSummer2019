12.721	I work with children with autism.
15.391	Specifically, I make technologies
17.305	to help them communicate.
19.476	Now, many of the problems that children
21.015	with autism face, they have a common source,
24.778	and that source is that they find it difficult
26.872	to understand abstraction, symbolism.
32.132	And because of this, they have 
32.132	a lot of difficulty with language.
36.784	Let me tell you a little bit about why this is.
39.799	You see that this is a picture of a bowl of soup.
43.733	All of us can see it. All of us understand this.
46.218	These are two other pictures of soup,
48.53	but you can see that these are more abstract
50.597	These are not quite as concrete.
52.453	And when you get to language,
54.627	you see that it becomes a word
56.495	whose look, the way it looks and the way it sounds,
59.756	has absolutely nothing to do 
59.756	with what it started with,
62.668	or what it represents, which is the bowl of soup.
65.498	So it's essentially a completely abstract,
68.398	a completely arbitrary representation of something
70.974	which is in the real world,
72.137	and this is something that children with autism
73.928	have an incredible amount of difficulty with.
77.092	Now that's why most of the people 
77.092	that work with children with autism --
79.843	speech therapists, educators --
81.721	what they do is, they try to help children with autism
84.354	communicate not with words, but with pictures.
87.583	So if a child with autism wanted to say,
89.513	"""I want soup,"" that child would pick"
91.971	"three different pictures, ""I,"" ""want,"" and ""soup,"""
94.231	and they would put these together,
95.84	and then the therapist or the parent would
97.707	understand that this is what the kid wants to say.
99.594	And this has been incredibly effective;
101.372	for the last 30, 40 years
103.513	people have been doing this.
105.126	In fact, a few years back,
106.475	I developed an app for the iPad
109.15	which does exactly this. It's called Avaz,
111.405	and the way it works is that kids select
113.684	different pictures.
115.005	These pictures are sequenced
115.005	together to form sentences,
117.575	and these sentences are spoken out.
119.294	So Avaz is essentially converting pictures,
122.319	it's a translator, it converts pictures into speech.
126.279	Now, this was very effective.
127.997	There are thousands of children using this,
129.381	you know, all over the world,
130.811	and I started thinking about
132.986	what it does and what it doesn't do.
135.64	And I realized something interesting:
137.324	Avaz helps children with autism learn words.
141.527	What it doesn't help them do is to learn
143.932	word patterns.
146.68	Let me explain this in a little more detail.
149.152	"Take this sentence: ""I want soup tonight."""
152.209	Now it's not just the words
152.209	here that convey the meaning.
156.289	It's also the way in which these words are arranged,
159.429	the way these words are modified and arranged.
161.959	"And that's why a sentence like ""I want soup tonight"""
164.265	is different from a sentence like
166.249	"""Soup want I tonight,"" which "
166.249	is completely meaningless.
169.561	So there is another hidden abstraction here
172.18	which children with autism find
172.18	a lot of difficulty coping with,
175.737	and that's the fact that you can modify words
178.577	and you can arrange them to have
180.678	different meanings, to convey different ideas.
183.573	Now, this is what we call grammar.
187.032	And grammar is incredibly powerful,
189.068	because grammar is this one component of language
192.225	which takes this finite vocabulary that all of us have
195.714	and allows us to convey an
195.714	infinite amount of information,
200.245	an infinite amount of ideas.
202.379	It's the way in which you can put things together
204.381	in order to convey anything you want to.
206.549	And so after I developed Avaz,
208.676	I worried for a very long time
210.244	about how I could give grammar 
210.244	to children with autism.
214.154	The solution came to me from
214.154	a very interesting perspective.
216.429	I happened to chance upon a child with autism
219.878	conversing with her mom,
221.987	and this is what happened.
224.081	Completely out of the blue, very spontaneously,
226.267	"the child got up and said, ""Eat."""
228.73	Now what was interesting was
230.5	the way in which the mom was trying to tease out
234.744	the meaning of what the child wanted to say
236.957	by talking to her in questions.
239.217	"So she asked, ""Eat what? Do "
239.217	you want to eat ice cream?
241.81	You want to eat? Somebody else wants to eat?
243.922	You want to eat cream now? You
243.922	"want to eat ice cream in the evening?"""
247.235	And then it struck me that
248.749	what the mother had done was something incredible.
250.777	She had been able to get that child to communicate
252.771	an idea to her without grammar.
256.909	And it struck me that maybe this is what
259.605	I was looking for.
260.99	Instead of arranging words in an order, in sequence,
265.132	as a sentence, you arrange them
267.304	in this map, where they're all linked together
271.115	not by placing them one after the other
273.258	but in questions, in question-answer pairs.
276.542	And so if you do this, then what you're conveying
278.9	is not a sentence in English,
280.886	but what you're conveying is really a meaning,
283.852	the meaning of a sentence in English.
285.363	Now, meaning is really the underbelly,
285.363	in some sense, of language.
288.295	It's what comes after thought but before language.
292.116	And the idea was that this particular representation
294.619	might convey meaning in its raw form.
297.88	So I was very excited by this, you know,
299.651	hopping around all over the place,
301.144	trying to figure out if I can convert
302.915	all possible sentences that I hear into this.
305.439	And I found that this is not enough.
307.212	Why is this not enough?
308.597	This is not enough because if you wanted to convey
310.308	something like negation,
312.558	"you want to say, ""I don't want soup,"""
314.294	then you can't do that by asking a question.
316.514	"You do that by changing the word ""want."""
318.799	Again, if you wanted to say,
320.436	"""I wanted soup yesterday,"""
322.416	you do that by converting
322.416	"the word ""want"" into ""wanted."""
325.153	It's a past tense.
326.819	So this is a flourish which I added
328.922	to make the system complete.
330.498	This is a map of words joined together
332.475	as questions and answers,
334.131	and with these filters applied on top of them
336.395	in order to modify them to represent
338.212	certain nuances.
339.921	Let me show you this with a different example.
341.872	Let's take this sentence:
343.126	"""I told the carpenter I could not pay him."""
345.106	It's a fairly complicated sentence.
346.898	The way that this particular system works,
348.791	you can start with any part of this sentence.
351.369	"I'm going to start with the word ""tell."""
353.067	"So this is the word ""tell."""
354.529	Now this happened in the past,
356.129	"so I'm going to make that ""told."""
358.352	Now, what I'm going to do is,
360.06	I'm going to ask questions.
361.816	So, who told? I told.
364.18	I told whom? I told the carpenter.
366.107	Now we start with a different part of the sentence.
367.858	"We start with the word ""pay,"""
369.725	"and we add the ability filter to it to make it ""can pay."""
374.302	"Then we make it ""can't pay,"""
376.403	"and we can make it ""couldn't pay"""
378.002	by making it the past tense.
379.665	So who couldn't pay? I couldn't pay.
381.588	Couldn't pay whom? I couldn't pay the carpenter.
384.264	And then you join these two together
385.995	by asking this question:
387.345	What did I tell the carpenter?
389.082	I told the carpenter I could not pay him.
393.131	Now think about this. This is
395.068	—(Applause)—
398.61	this is a representation of this sentence
402.282	without language.
404.717	And there are two or three
404.717	interesting things about this.
406.909	First of all, I could have started anywhere.
410.04	"I didn't have to start with the word ""tell."""
412.283	I could have started anywhere in the sentence,
413.699	and I could have made this entire thing.
415.206	The second thing is, if I wasn't an English speaker,
417.982	if I was speaking in some other language,
420.157	this map would actually hold true in any language.
423.313	So long as the questions are standardized,
425.303	the map is actually independent of language.
429.59	So I call this FreeSpeech,
431.705	and I was playing with this for many, many months.
434.64	I was trying out so many
434.64	different combinations of this.
437.366	And then I noticed something very
437.366	interesting about FreeSpeech.
439.655	I was trying to convert language,
442.898	convert sentences in English
442.898	into sentences in FreeSpeech,
445.282	and vice versa, and back and forth.
447.034	And I realized that this particular configuration,
449.289	this particular way of representing language,
451.315	it allowed me to actually create very concise rules
455.71	that go between FreeSpeech on one side
458.444	and English on the other.
459.932	So I could actually write this set of rules
462.112	that translates from this particular
462.112	representation into English.
465.507	And so I developed this thing.
467.338	I developed this thing called 
467.338	the FreeSpeech Engine
469.57	which takes any FreeSpeech sentence as the input
472.131	and gives out perfectly grammatical English text.
476.061	And by putting these two pieces together,
477.666	the representation and the engine,
479.547	I was able to create an app, a
479.547	technology for children with autism,
483.343	that not only gives them words
485.842	but also gives them grammar.
489.783	So I tried this out with kids with autism,
492.143	and I found that there was an 
492.143	incredible amount of identification.
497.156	They were able to create sentences in FreeSpeech
499.876	which were much more complicated
499.876	but much more effective
502.434	than equivalent sentences in English,
505.333	and I started thinking about
507.015	why that might be the case.
508.984	And I had an idea, and I want to 
508.984	talk to you about this idea next.
513.271	In about 1997, about 15 years back,
516.413	there were a group of scientists that were trying
518.424	to understand how the brain processes language,
520.813	and they found something very interesting.
522.592	They found that when you learn a language
524.464	as a child, as a two-year-old,
527.376	you learn it with a certain part of your brain,
529.742	and when you learn a language as an adult --
531.342	for example, if I wanted to
531.342	learn Japanese right now —
535.253	a completely different part of my brain is used.
537.96	Now I don't know why that's the case,
539.791	but my guess is that that's because
541.782	when you learn a language as an adult,
544.219	you almost invariably learn it
545.835	through your native language, or
545.835	through your first language.
550.101	So what's interesting about FreeSpeech
553.353	is that when you create a sentence
555.155	or when you create language,
556.85	a child with autism creates
556.85	language with FreeSpeech,
559.92	they're not using this support language,
561.753	they're not using this bridge language.
563.964	They're directly constructing the sentence.
566.621	And so this gave me this idea.
568.814	Is it possible to use FreeSpeech
570.838	not for children with autism
573.348	but to teach language to people without disabilities?
579.61	And so I tried a number of experiments.
581.588	The first thing I did was I built a jigsaw puzzle
584.536	in which these questions and answers
586.506	are coded in the form of shapes,
588.341	in the form of colors,
589.479	and you have people putting these together
591.328	and trying to understand how this works.
593.101	And I built an app out of it, a game out of it,
595.477	in which children can play with words
598.138	and with a reinforcement,
599.842	a sound reinforcement of visual structures,
602.427	they're able to learn language.
604.44	And this, this has a lot of potential, a lot of promise,
607.176	and the government of India recently
609.151	licensed this technology from us,
610.555	and they're going to try it out
610.555	with millions of different children
612.629	trying to teach them English.
615.234	And the dream, the hope, the vision, really,
617.848	is that when they learn English this way,
620.93	they learn it with the same proficiency
623.573	as their mother tongue.
627.291	All right, let's talk about something else.
631.107	Let's talk about speech.
633.104	This is speech.
634.375	So speech is the primary mode of communication
636.337	delivered between all of us.
637.95	Now what's interesting about speech is that
639.805	speech is one-dimensional.
641.05	Why is it one-dimensional?
642.409	It's one-dimensional because it's sound.
643.977	It's also one-dimensional because
645.516	our mouths are built that way.
646.721	Our mouths are built to create
646.721	one-dimensional sound.
650.233	But if you think about the brain,
653.099	the thoughts that we have in our heads
654.863	are not one-dimensional.
656.965	I mean, we have these rich,
658.424	complicated, multi-dimensional ideas.
661.452	Now, it seems to me that language
663.142	is really the brain's invention
665.474	to convert this rich, multi-dimensional thought
668.57	on one hand
670.157	into speech on the other hand.
672.08	Now what's interesting is that
673.842	we do a lot of work in information nowadays,
676.41	and almost all of that is done
676.41	in the language domain.
679.489	Take Google, for example.
681.428	Google trawls all these
681.428	countless billions of websites,
684.105	all of which are in English,
684.105	and when you want to use Google,
686.83	you go into Google search, and you type in English,
689.28	and it matches the English with the English.
693.443	What if we could do this in FreeSpeech instead?
697.026	I have a suspicion that if we did this,
699.327	we'd find that algorithms like searching,
701.395	like retrieval, all of these things,
703.72	are much simpler and also more effective,
706.795	because they don't process
706.795	the data structure of speech.
711.212	Instead they're processing
711.212	the data structure of thought.
717.188	The data structure of thought.
719.996	That's a provocative idea.
722.072	But let's look at this in a little more detail.
724.214	So this is the FreeSpeech ecosystem.
726.58	We have the Free Speech
726.58	representation on one side,
729.464	and we have the FreeSpeech 
729.464	Engine, which generates English.
731.694	Now if you think about it,
733.419	FreeSpeech, I told you, is completely 
733.419	language-independent.
735.963	It doesn't have any specific information in it
738.05	which is about English.
739.278	So everything that this system knows about English
742.078	is actually encoded into the engine.
746.698	That's a pretty interesting concept in itself.
748.935	You've encoded an entire human language
752.539	into a software program.
755.184	But if you look at what's inside the engine,
757.715	it's actually not very complicated.
760.073	It's not very complicated code.
762.178	And what's more interesting is the fact that
764.85	the vast majority of the code in that engine
767.053	is not really English-specific.
769.465	And that gives this interesting idea.
771.36	It might be very easy for us to actually
773.398	create these engines in many,
773.398	many different languages,
777.224	in Hindi, in French, in German, in Swahili.
783.578	And that gives another interesting idea.
786.377	For example, supposing I was a writer,
789.031	say, for a newspaper or for a magazine.
791.153	I could create content in one language, FreeSpeech,
796.164	and the person who's consuming that content,
798.22	the person who's reading that particular information
801.281	could choose any engine,
803.776	and they could read it in their own mother tongue,
806.512	in their native language.
810.451	I mean, this is an incredibly attractive idea,
813.173	especially for India.
815.172	We have so many different languages.
816.862	There's a song about India, and there's a description
819.004	of the country as, it says,
821.348	(in Sanskrit).
823.708	"That means ""ever-smiling speaker"
826.481	"of beautiful languages."""
831	Language is beautiful.
832.964	I think it's the most beautiful of human creations.
835.418	I think it's the loveliest thing
835.418	that our brains have invented.
839.396	It entertains, it educates, it enlightens,
842.98	but what I like the most about language
845.024	is that it empowers.
846.524	I want to leave you with this.
848.362	This is a photograph of my collaborators,
850.747	my earliest collaborators
851.744	when I started working on language
853.206	and autism and various other things.
854.708	The girl's name is Pavna,
856.125	and that's her mother, Kalpana.
858.027	And Pavna's an entrepreneur,
860.165	but her story is much more remarkable than mine,
862.536	because Pavna is about 23.
864.936	She has quadriplegic cerebral palsy,
867.488	so ever since she was born,
869.128	she could neither move nor talk.
872.728	And everything that she's accomplished so far,
875.131	finishing school, going to college,
877.358	starting a company,
878.774	collaborating with me to develop Avaz,
880.914	all of these things she's done
882.806	with nothing more than moving her eyes.
888.329	Daniel Webster said this:
891.018	"He said, ""If all of my possessions were taken"
893.958	from me with one exception,
896.946	I would choose to keep the power of communication,
899.927	"for with it, I would regain all the rest."""
903.83	And that's why, of all of these incredible 
903.83	applications of FreeSpeech,
908.946	the one that's closest to my heart
911.026	still remains the ability for this
913.094	to empower children with disabilities
915.474	to be able to communicate,
917.247	the power of communication,
919.036	to get back all the rest.
921.276	Thank you.
922.673	(Applause)
924.005	Thank you. (Applause)
928.204	Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
933.527	Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
