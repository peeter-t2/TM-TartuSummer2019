13.658	Imagine you are a part
13.658	of a crew of astronauts
18.124	traveling to Mars or some distant planet.
21.854	The travel time could take a year
24.91	or even longer.
26.836	The space on board and the resources
29.797	would be limited.
31.361	So you and the crew would have
31.361	to figure out how to produce food
35.972	with minimal inputs.
38.169	What if you could bring with you
38.169	just a few packets of seeds,
42.965	and grow crops in a matter of hours?
46.914	And what if those crops
46.914	would then make more seeds,
50.375	enabling you to feed the entire crew
53.453	with just those few packets of seeds
53.453	for the duration of the trip?
58.465	Well, the scientists at NASA actually
58.465	figured out a way to do this.
63.546	What they came up with
63.546	was actually quite interesting.
66.213	It involved microorganisms,
68.133	which are single-celled organisms.
70.732	And they also used hydrogen from water.
73.511	The types of microbes that they used
73.511	were called hydrogenotrophs,
77.623	and with these hydrogenotrophs,
77.623	you can create a virtuous carbon cycle
82.937	that would sustain life
82.937	onboard a spacecraft.
86.525	Astronauts would breathe out
86.525	carbon dioxide,
90.241	that carbon dioxide would then
90.241	be captured by the microbes
94.066	and converted into a nutritious,
94.066	carbon-rich crop.
98.287	The astronauts would then eat
98.287	that carbon-rich crop
101.902	and exhale the carbon out
101.902	in the form of carbon dioxide,
105.916	which would then be captured
105.916	by the microbes,
108.164	to create a nutritious crop,
109.823	which then would be exhaled
109.823	in the form of carbon dioxide
112.742	by the astronauts.
114.176	So in this way, a closed-loop
114.176	carbon cycle is created.
117.821	So why is this important?
120.158	We need carbon to survive as humans,
122.872	and we get our carbon from food.
125.237	On a long space journey,
126.944	you simply wouldn't be able to pick up
126.944	any carbon along the way,
130.287	so you'd have to figure out
130.287	how to recycle it on board.
133.817	This is a clever solution, right?
136.825	But the thing is, that research
136.825	didn't really go anywhere.
140.553	We haven't yet gone to Mars.
140.553	We haven't yet gone to another planet.
144.299	And this was actually done
144.299	in the '60s and '70s.
147.365	So a colleague of mine,
147.365	Dr. John Reed, and I,
150.746	were interested, actually,
150.746	in carbon recycling here on Earth.
154.741	We wanted to come up
154.741	with technical solutions
156.996	to address climate change.
158.78	And we discovered this research
161.025	by reading some papers published
161.025	in the '60s -- 1967 and later --
165.469	articles about this work.
168.292	And we thought it was a really good idea.
170.774	So we said, well, Earth
170.774	is actually like a spaceship.
174.37	We have limited space
174.37	and limited resources,
177.806	and on Earth, we really do
177.806	need to figure out
180.013	how to recycle our carbon better.
183.202	So we had the idea,
185.373	can we take some of these
185.373	NASA-type ideas and apply them
192.147	to our carbon problem here on Earth?
194.936	Could we cultivate
194.936	these NASA-type microbes
197.592	in order to make
197.592	valuable products here on Earth?
201.241	We started a company to do it.
203.717	And in that company, we discovered
203.717	that these hydrogenotrophs --
208.421	which I'll actually call
208.421	nature's supercharged carbon recyclers --
212.382	we found that they are a powerful
212.382	class of microbes
215.225	that had been largely overlooked
215.225	and understudied,
219.077	and that they could make
219.077	some really valuable products.
222.544	So we began cultivating these products,
222.544	these microbes, in our lab.
227.115	We found that we can make
227.115	essential amino acids from carbon dioxide
230.994	using these microbes.
232.483	And we even made a protein-rich meal
235.552	that has an amino acid profile
235.552	similar to what you might find
240.047	in some animal proteins.
242.523	We began cultivating them even further,
244.957	and we found that we can make oil.
246.898	Oils are used to manufacture
246.898	many products.
249.738	We made an oil that was similar
249.738	to a citrus oil,
253.095	which can be used for flavoring
253.095	and for fragrances,
256.204	but it also can be used
256.204	as a biodegradable cleaner
258.855	or even as a jet fuel.
261.236	And we made an oil
261.236	that's similar to palm oil.
264.065	Palm oil is used to manufacture
266.049	a wide range of consumer
266.049	and industrial goods.
270.873	We began working with manufacturers
270.873	to scale up this technology,
275.639	and we're currently working with them
277.47	to bring some of these products to market.
280.756	We believe this type of technology
280.756	can indeed help us
283.72	profitably recycle carbon dioxide
283.72	into valuable products --
287.777	something that's beneficial
287.777	for the planet
289.839	but also beneficial for business.
292.383	That's what we're doing today.
294.225	But tomorrow, this type of technology
294.225	and using these types of microbes
298.479	actually could help us
298.479	do something even greater
301.266	if we take it to the next level.
304.045	We believe that this type of technology
306.487	can actually help us address
306.487	an issue with agriculture
309.75	and allow us to create
309.75	a type of agriculture that's sustainable,
314.299	that will allow us to scale
314.299	to meet the demands of tomorrow.
318.585	And why might we need
318.585	a sustainable agriculture?
322.325	Well, actually, it is estimated
324.537	that the population will reach
324.537	about 10 billion by 2050,
329.798	and we're projecting that we will need
329.798	to increase food production
333.003	by 70 percent.
335.182	In addition, we will need many more
335.182	resources and raw materials
338.444	to make consumer goods
338.444	and industrial goods.
341.571	So how will we scale to meet that demand?
344.669	Well, modern agriculture simply cannot
344.669	sustainably scale to meet that demand.
350.76	There are a number of reasons why.
353.309	One of them is that modern agriculture
353.309	is one of the largest emitters
358.169	of greenhouse gases.
359.774	In fact, it emits more greenhouse gases
363.421	than our cars, our trucks, our planes
366.549	and our trains combined.
369.009	Another reason is that modern ag
369.009	simply takes up a whole lot of land.
374.549	We have cleared 19.4 million square miles
374.549	for crops and livestock.
381.446	What does that look like?
383.118	Well, that's roughly the size
383.118	of South America and Africa combined.
389.041	Let me give you a specific example.
391.324	In Indonesia, an amount
391.324	of virgin rainforest was cleared
396.304	totaling the size
396.304	of approximately Ireland,
399.71	between 2000 and 2012.
402.717	Just think of all
402.717	of the species, the diversity,
405.947	that was removed in the process,
407.861	whether plant life, insects
407.861	or animal life.
411.145	And a natural carbon sink
411.145	was also removed.
414.437	So let me make this real for you.
416.896	This clearing happened primarily
416.896	to make room for palm plantations.
421.399	And as I mentioned before,
422.798	palm oil is used
422.798	to manufacture many products.
426.371	In fact, it is estimated
426.371	that over 50 percent of consumer products
430.322	are manufactured using palm oil.
433.671	And that includes things
433.671	like ice cream, cookies ...
437.506	It includes cooking oils.
439.397	It also includes detergents,
439.397	lotions, soaps.
443.594	You and I both
443.594	probably have numerous items
448.395	in our kitchens and our bathrooms
450.92	that were manufactured using palm oil.
453.45	So you and I are direct beneficiaries
453.45	of removed rainforests.
459.691	Modern ag has some problems,
461.804	and we need solutions
461.804	if we want to scale sustainably.
467.151	I believe that microbes
467.151	can be a part of the answer --
471.701	specifically, these supercharged
471.701	carbon recyclers.
475.708	These supercharged carbon recyclers,
478.254	like plants, serve as
478.254	the natural recyclers
482.309	in their ecosystems where they thrive.
484.454	And they thrive in exotic places on Earth,
486.674	like hydrothermal vents and hot springs.
489.543	In those ecosystems,
489.543	they take carbon and recycle it
492.83	into the nutrients needed
492.83	for those ecosystems.
495.916	And they're rich in nutrients,
497.399	such as oils and proteins,
497.399	minerals and carbohydrates.
504.025	And actually, microbes are already
504.025	an integral part of our everyday lives.
509.335	If you enjoy a glass of pinot noir
509.335	on a Friday night,
513.566	after a long, hard work week,
515.534	then you are enjoying
515.534	a product of microbes.
519.176	If you enjoy a beer
519.176	from your local microbrewery --
521.882	a product of microbes.
523.526	Or bread, or cheese, or yogurt.
527.06	These are all products of microbes.
529.729	But the beauty and power associated
529.729	with these supercharged carbon recyclers
535.038	lies in the fact that they can
535.038	actually produce in a matter of hours
540.162	versus months.
541.512	That means we can make crops
543.479	much faster than we're making them today.
547.685	They grow in the dark,
549.344	so they can grow in any season
551.915	and in any geography and any location.
555.159	They can grow in containers
555.159	that require minimal space.
559.562	And we can get to a type
559.562	of vertical agriculture.
563.54	Instead of our traditional
563.54	horizontal agriculture
566.221	that requires so much land,
567.974	we can scale vertically,
569.571	and as a result
569.571	produce much more product per area.
576.187	If we implement this type of approach
576.187	and use these carbon recyclers,
580.675	then we wouldn't have to remove
580.675	any more rainforests
583.995	to make the food and the goods
583.995	that we consume.
588.524	Because, at a large scale,
590.761	you can actually make 10,000 times
590.761	more output per land area
596.093	than you could -- for instance,
596.093	if you used soybeans --
599.272	if you planted soybeans
599.272	on that same area of land
602.356	over a period of a year.
604.531	Ten thousand times
604.531	over a period of a year.
608.3	So this is what I mean
608.3	by a new type of agriculture.
612.613	And this is what I mean
612.613	by developing a system
615.945	that allows us to sustainably scale
615.945	to meet the demands of 10 billion.
622.704	And what would be the products
622.704	of this new type of agriculture?
626.323	Well, we've already made a protein meal,
628.53	so you can imagine something
628.53	similar to a soybean meal,
631.817	or even cornmeal, or wheat flour.
634.203	We've already made oils,
635.58	so you can imagine something
635.58	similar to coconut oil
639.282	or olive oil or soybean oil.
642.042	So this type of crop can
642.042	actually produce the nutrients
646.304	that would give us pasta and bread,
648.623	cakes, nutritional items of many sorts.
652.226	Furthermore, since oil is used
652.226	to manufacture multiple other goods,
659.162	industrial products and consumer products,
661.242	you can imagine being able to make
661.242	detergents, soaps, lotions, etc.,
666.069	using these types of crops.
669.382	Not only are we running out of space,
672.286	but if we continue to operate
672.286	under the status quo
675.478	with modern agriculture,
676.975	we run the risk of robbing our progeny
676.975	of a beautiful planet.
682.216	But it doesn't have to be this way.
684.627	We can imagine a future of abundance.
688.154	Let us create systems that keep
688.154	planet Earth, our spaceship,
694.054	not only from not crashing,
696.41	but let us also develop systems
696.41	and ways of living
700.564	that will be beneficial
700.564	to the lives of ourselves
704.746	and the 10 billion that will
704.746	be on this planet by 2050.
708.817	Thank you very much.
710.056	(Applause)
