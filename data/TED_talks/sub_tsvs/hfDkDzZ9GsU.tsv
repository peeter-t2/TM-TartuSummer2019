12.772	I am a chef
14.336	and a food policy guy,
16.779	but I come from a whole
16.779	family of teachers.
20.096	My sister is a special ed
20.096	teacher in Chicago.
23.415	My father just retired
23.415	after 25 years teaching fifth grade.
28.177	My aunt and uncle were professors.
30.346	My cousins all teach.
32.022	Everybody in my family, basically,
32.022	teaches except for me.
36.778	They taught me that the only way
36.778	to get the right answers
41.646	is to ask the right questions.
45.051	So what are the right questions
46.658	when it comes to improving
46.658	the educational outcomes for our children?
52.806	There's obviously
52.806	many important questions,
55.652	but I think the following
55.652	is a good place to start:
59.046	What do we think the connection is
61.114	between a child's growing mind
64.557	and their growing body?
66.87	What can we expect our kids to learn
69.632	if their diets are full of sugar
69.632	and empty of nutrients?
74.617	What can they possibly learn
76.822	if their bodies
76.822	are literally going hungry?
82.157	And with all the resources
82.157	that we are pouring into schools,
85.988	we should stop and ask ourselves:
88.164	Are we really setting
88.164	our kids up for success?
92.119	Now, a few years ago,
93.848	I was a judge on a cooking
93.848	"competition called ""Chopped."""
98.598	Four chefs compete
98.598	with mystery ingredients
101.602	to see who can cook the best dishes.
105.008	Except for this episode --
105.008	it was a very special one.
109.402	Instead of four overzealous chefs
109.402	trying to break into the limelight --
112.858	something that I would know
112.858	nothing about --
114.949	(Laughter)
116.014	these chefs were school chefs;
118.697	you know, the women that you used
118.697	"to call ""lunch ladies,"""
121.87	but the ones I insist
121.87	"we call ""school chefs."""
125.303	Now, these women -- God bless
125.303	these women --
128.307	spend their day cooking
128.307	for thousands of kids,
132.264	breakfast and lunch,
132.264	with only $2.68 per lunch,
136.056	with only about a dollar of that
136.056	actually going to the food.
140.226	In this episode,
142.13	the main-course
142.13	mystery ingredient was quinoa.
145.4	Now, I know it's been a long time
147.085	since most of you have had a school lunch,
149.305	and we've made a lot
149.305	of progress on nutrition,
151.941	but quinoa still is not a staple
151.941	in most school cafeterias.
155.099	(Laughter)
156.966	So this was a challenge.
158.957	But the dish that I will never forget
158.957	was cooked by a woman
162.198	named Cheryl Barbara.
163.879	Cheryl was the nutrition director
165.637	at High School in the Community
165.637	in Connecticut.
168.025	She cooked this delicious pasta.
170.206	It was amazing.
171.456	It was a pappardelle with Italian sausage,
174.123	kale, Parmesan cheese.
175.919	It was delicious, like,
175.919	restaurant-quality good, except --
179.202	she basically just threw the quinoa,
179.202	pretty much uncooked,
182.986	into the dish.
184.553	It was a strange choice,
186.297	and it was super crunchy.
188.794	(Laughter)
191.46	So I took on the TV accusatory judge thing
191.46	that you're supposed to do,
196.402	and I asked her why she did that.
198.794	"Cheryl responded, ""Well, first,"
198.794	"I don't know what quinoa is."""
202.137	(Laughter)
203.221	"""But I do know that it's a Monday,"
207.261	and that in my school,
207.261	at High School in the Community,
210.642	"I always cook pasta."""
213.116	See, Cheryl explained
213.116	that for many of her kids,
216.574	there were no meals on the weekends.
220.728	No meals on Saturday.
224.343	No meals on Sunday, either.
227.047	So she cooked pasta
227.047	because she wanted to make sure
230.537	she cooked something she knew
230.537	her children would eat.
236.76	Something that would stick
236.76	to their ribs, she said.
240.882	Something that would fill them up.
244.972	Cheryl talked about how,
244.972	by the time Monday came,
249.967	her kids' hunger pangs were so intense
252.592	that they couldn't even begin
252.592	to think about learning.
256.356	Food was the only thing on their mind.
262.714	The only thing.
264.296	And unfortunately, the stats --
264.296	they tell the same story.
268.071	So, let's put this
268.071	into the context of a child.
272.633	And we're going to focus on
273.963	the most important meal
273.963	of the day, breakfast.
276.231	Meet Allison.
277.566	She's 12 years old,
279.094	she's smart as a whip
280.774	and she wants to be a physicist
280.774	when she grows up.
283.561	If Allison goes to a school
283.561	that serves a nutritious breakfast
287.594	to all of their kids,
288.864	here's what's going to follow.
290.946	Her chances of getting a nutritious meal,
294.235	one with fruit and milk,
294.235	one lower in sugar and salt,
297.425	dramatically increase.
299.637	Allison will have a lower rate
299.637	of obesity than the average kid.
303.344	She'll have to visit the nurse less.
305.153	She'll have lower levels
305.153	of anxiety and depression.
308.196	She'll have better behavior.
309.736	She'll have better attendance,
309.736	and she'll show up on time more often.
313.015	Why?
314.411	Well, because there's a good meal
314.411	waiting for her at school.
318.007	Overall, Allison is in much better health
321.461	than the average school kid.
323.887	So what about that kid
325.544	who doesn't have a nutritious
325.544	breakfast waiting for him?
328.555	Well, meet Tommy.
330.546	He's also 12. He's a wonderful kid.
332.998	He wants to be a doctor.
334.785	By the time Tommy is in kindergarten,
336.573	he's already underperforming in math.
340.174	By the time he's in third grade,
342.378	he's got lower math and reading scores.
346.158	By the time he's 11,
347.975	it's more likely that Tommy will have
347.975	to have repeated a grade.
353.092	Research shows that kids
353.092	who do not have consistent nourishment,
356.213	particularly at breakfast,
357.492	have poor cognitive function overall.
362.75	So how widespread is this problem?
365.676	Well, unfortunately, it's pervasive.
369.228	Let me give you two stats
370.477	that seem like they're on opposite
370.477	ends of the issue,
373.465	but are actually two sides
373.465	of the same coin.
376.14	On the one hand,
378.178	one in six Americans are food insecure,
381.41	including 16 million children --
381.41	almost 20 percent --
385.394	are food insecure.
386.808	In this city alone, in New York City,
	face hunger every year.
396.884	It's crazy.
398.48	On the other hand,
400.503	diet and nutrition is the number one cause
400.503	of preventable death and disease
404.636	in this country, by far.
407.271	And fully a third of the kids
407.271	that we've been talking about tonight
410.516	are on track to have diabetes
410.516	in their lifetime.
414.807	Now, what's hard
414.807	to put together but is true
417.213	is that, many times,
417.213	these are the same children.
420.855	So they fill up on the unhealthy
420.855	and cheap calories
423.778	that surround them in their communities
423.778	and that their families can afford.
428.752	But then by the end of the month,
431.757	food stamps run out
431.757	or hours get cut at work,
435.346	and they don't have the money
435.346	to cover the basic cost of food.
440.089	But we should be able
440.089	to solve this problem, right?
443.439	We know what the answers are.
445.917	As part of my work at the White House,
445.917	we instituted a program
450.072	that for all schools that had
453.59	we could serve breakfast and lunch
453.59	to every kid in that school.
458.272	For free.
460.305	This program has been
460.305	incredibly successful,
462.38	because it helped us overcome
462.38	a very difficult barrier
466.456	when it came to getting kids
466.456	a nutritious breakfast.
469.625	And that was the barrier of stigma.
473.769	See, schools serve
473.769	breakfast before school,
479.778	and it was only available
479.778	for the poor kids.
485.371	So everybody knew who was poor
485.371	and who needed government help.
489.597	Now, all kids, no matter how much
489.597	or how little their parents make,
494.421	have a lot of pride.
497.107	So what happened?
498.977	Well, the schools that have
498.977	implemented this program
501.469	saw an increase in math and reading
501.469	scores by 17.5 percent.
509.49	And research shows that when kids
509.49	have a consistent, nutritious breakfast,
515.882	their chances of graduating
515.882	increase by 20 percent.
523.012	When we give our kids
523.012	the nourishment they need,
526.795	we give them the chance to thrive,
529.955	both in the classroom and beyond.
532.9	Now, you don't have to trust me on this,
536.644	but you should talk to Donna Martin.
539.249	I love Donna Martin.
541.02	Donna Martin is the school nutrition
541.02	director at Burke County
544.721	in Waynesboro, Georgia.
547.053	Burke County is one
547.053	of the poorest districts
549.79	in the fifth-poorest state in the country,
552.517	and about 100 percent of Donna's students
552.517	live at or below the poverty line.
559.672	A few years ago,
560.907	Donna decided to get out ahead
560.907	of the new standards that were coming,
564.885	and overhaul her nutrition standards.
568.2	She improved and added
568.2	fruit and vegetables and whole grains.
572.875	She served breakfast in the classroom
572.875	to all of her kids.
576.374	And she implemented a dinner program.
578.222	Why?
580.336	Well, many of her kids didn't have
580.336	dinner when they went home.
583.975	So how did they respond?
586.208	Well, the kids loved the food.
589.577	They loved the better nutrition,
591.289	and they loved not being hungry.
594.759	But Donna's biggest supporter
594.759	came from an unexpected place.
599.055	His name from Eric Parker,
601.163	and he was the head football coach
601.163	for the Burke County Bears.
605.668	Now, Coach Parker had coached
605.668	mediocre teams for years.
608.757	The Bears often ended
608.757	in the middle of the pack --
611.704	a big disappointment in one
611.704	of the most passionate football states
614.89	in the Union.
616.542	But the year Donna changed the menus,
621.174	the Bears not only won their division,
624.705	they went on to win
624.705	the state championship,
627.168	beating the Peach County Trojans
630.904	(Laughter)
633.283	And Coach Parker,
635.507	he credited that championship
635.507	to Donna Martin.
641.274	When we give our kids
641.274	the basic nourishment,
644.059	they're going to thrive.
646.31	And it's not just
646.31	up to the Cheryl Barbaras
649.374	and the Donna Martins of the world.
652.039	It's on all of us.
654.218	And feeding our kids the basic nutrition
654.218	is just the starting point.
659.517	What I've laid out is really a model
661.506	for so many of the most pressing
661.506	issues that we face.
666.183	If we focus on the simple goal
666.183	of properly nourishing ourselves,
672.514	we could see a world
672.514	that is more stable and secure;
676.929	we could dramatically improve
676.929	our economic productivity;
681.023	we could transform our health care
684.736	and we could go a long way
686.436	in ensuring that the Earth can provide
686.436	for generations to come.
689.506	Food is that place
689.506	where our collective efforts
694.198	can have the greatest impact.
697.825	So we have to ask ourselves:
697.825	What is the right question?
700.934	What would happen
702.486	if we fed ourselves more nutritious,
702.486	more sustainably grown food?
708.702	What would be the impact?
711.184	Cheryl Barbara,
713.909	Donna Martin,
715.555	Coach Parker and the Burke County Bears --
718.539	I think they know the answer.
720.207	Thank you guys so very much.
721.842	(Applause)
