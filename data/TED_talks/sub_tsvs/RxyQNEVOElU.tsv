12.93	Every day we face issues like climate change
16.058	or the safety of vaccines
17.488	where we have to answer questions whose answers
20.528	rely heavily on scientific information.
23.989	Scientists tell us that the world is warming.
26.87	Scientists tell us that vaccines are safe.
29.411	But how do we know if they are right?
31.465	Why should be believe the science?
33.429	The fact is, many of us actually
33.429	don't believe the science.
36.898	Public opinion polls consistently show
39.074	that significant proportions of the American people
42.084	don't believe the climate is
42.084	warming due to human activities,
45.625	don't think that there is
45.625	evolution by natural selection,
48.564	and aren't persuaded by the safety of vaccines.
52.465	So why should we believe the science?
56.096	Well, scientists don't like talking about 
56.096	science as a matter of belief.
59.707	In fact, they would contrast science with faith,
62.294	and they would say belief is the domain of faith.
65.26	And faith is a separate thing
65.26	apart and distinct from science.
69.038	Indeed they would say religion is based on faith
72.19	or maybe the calculus of Pascal's wager.
75.884	Blaise Pascal was a 17th-century mathematician
78.56	who tried to bring scientific
78.56	reasoning to the question of
81.37	whether or not he should believe in God,
83.242	and his wager went like this:
85.846	Well, if God doesn't exist
88.395	but I decide to believe in him
90.42	nothing much is really lost.
92.398	Maybe a few hours on Sunday.
94.011	(Laughter)
95.004	But if he does exist and I don't believe in him,
98.385	then I'm in deep trouble.
100.402	And so Pascal said, we'd better believe in God.
103.438	Or as one of my college professors said,
105.61	"""He clutched for the handrail of faith."""
107.836	He made that leap of faith
109.772	leaving science and rationalism behind.
114.296	Now the fact is though, for most of us,
116.992	most scientific claims are a leap of faith.
120.126	We can't really judge scientific
120.126	claims for ourselves in most cases.
124.511	And indeed this is actually
124.511	true for most scientists as well
127.351	outside of their own specialties.
129.681	So if you think about it, a geologist can't tell you
132.201	whether a vaccine is safe.
133.951	Most chemists are not experts in evolutionary theory.
136.951	A physicist cannot tell you,
139.21	despite the claims of some of them,
140.653	whether or not tobacco causes cancer.
144.007	So, if even scientists themselves
146.457	have to make a leap of faith
147.733	outside their own fields,
149.655	then why do they accept the
149.655	claims of other scientists?
153.583	Why do they believe each other's claims?
155.881	And should we believe those claims?
159.171	So what I'd like to argue is yes, we should,
161.947	but not for the reason that most of us think.
164.83	Most of us were taught in school
164.83	that the reason we should
167.16	believe in science is because of the scientific method.
170.572	We were taught that scientists follow a method
173.488	and that this method guarantees
175.844	the truth of their claims.
177.84	The method that most of us were taught in school,
181.26	we can call it the textbook method,
182.836	is the hypothetical deductive method.
185.62	According to the standard
185.62	model, the textbook model,
188.714	scientists develop hypotheses, they deduce
191.671	the consequences of those hypotheses,
194.131	and then they go out into the world and they say,
195.841	"""Okay, well are those consequences true?"""
198.215	Can we observe them taking
198.215	place in the natural world?
201.548	And if they are true, then the scientists say,
204.148	"""Great, we know the hypothesis is correct."""
207.004	So there are many famous examples in the history
209.183	of science of scientists doing exactly this.
212.062	One of the most famous examples
214.12	comes from the work of Albert Einstein.
216.333	When Einstein developed the
216.333	theory of general relativity,
218.855	one of the consequences of his theory
221.171	was that space-time wasn't just an empty void
224.01	but that it actually had a fabric.
225.919	And that that fabric was bent
227.52	in the presence of massive objects like the sun.
230.9	So if this theory were true then it meant that light
233.649	as it passed the sun
235.177	should actually be bent around it.
237.345	That was a pretty startling prediction
239.745	and it took a few years before scientists
241.733	were able to test it
243.011	but they did test it in 1919,
245.521	and lo and behold it turned out to be true.
247.971	Starlight actually does bend
247.971	as it travels around the sun.
251.129	This was a huge confirmation of the theory.
253.623	It was considered proof of the truth
255.428	of this radical new idea,
256.74	and it was written up in many newspapers
258.592	around the globe.
261.13	Now, sometimes this theory or this model
263.48	is referred to as the deductive-nomological model,
266.914	mainly because academics like 
266.914	to make things complicated.
270.298	But also because in the ideal case, it's about laws.
275.559	So nomological means having to do with laws.
278.061	And in the ideal case, the hypothesis isn't just an idea:
281.485	ideally, it is a law of nature.
283.811	Why does it matter that it is a law of nature?
286.098	Because if it is a law, it can't be broken.
288.826	If it's a law then it will always be true
290.934	in all times and all places
292.178	no matter what the circumstances are.
294.384	And all of you know of at least
294.384	one example of a famous law:
297.613	Einstein's famous equation, E=MC2,
301.368	which tells us what the relationship is
303.168	between energy and mass.
305.361	And that relationship is true no matter what.
309.361	Now, it turns out, though, that there 
309.361	are several problems with this model.
313.01	The main problem is that it's wrong.
316.645	It's just not true. (Laughter)
320.147	And I'm going to talk about
320.147	three reasons why it's wrong.
322.87	So the first reason is a logical reason.
325.549	It's the problem of the fallacy
325.549	of affirming the consequent.
329.065	So that's another fancy, academic way of saying
331.891	that false theories can make true predictions.
334.561	So just because the prediction comes true
336.555	doesn't actually logically
336.555	prove that the theory is correct.
339.777	And I have a good example of that too, 
339.777	again from the history of science.
343.708	This is a picture of the Ptolemaic universe
346.403	with the Earth at the center of the universe
348.265	and the sun and the planets going around it.
350.86	The Ptolemaic model was believed
352.89	by many very smart people for many centuries.
356.143	Well, why?
357.879	Well the answer is because it made 
357.879	lots of predictions that came true.
361.316	The Ptolemaic system enabled astronomers
363.332	to make accurate predictions
363.332	of the motions of the planet,
366.082	in fact more accurate predictions at first
368.601	than the Copernican theory
368.601	which we now would say is true.
372.925	So that's one problem with the textbook model.
375.907	A second problem is a practical problem,
378.303	and it's the problem of auxiliary hypotheses.
381.538	Auxiliary hypotheses are assumptions
384.367	that scientists are making
386.146	that they may or may not even
386.146	be aware that they're making.
389.189	So an important example of this
391.85	comes from the Copernican model,
393.945	which ultimately replaced the Ptolemaic system.
397.137	So when Nicolaus Copernicus said,
399.177	actually the Earth is not the center of the universe,
401.827	the sun is the center of the solar system,
403.745	the Earth moves around the sun.
405.127	Scientists said, well okay, Nicolaus, if that's true
408.855	we ought to be able to detect the motion
410.619	of the Earth around the sun.
412.577	And so this slide here illustrates a concept
414.633	known as stellar parallax.
416.441	And astronomers said, if the Earth is moving
420.263	and we look at a prominent star, let's say, Sirius --
423.463	well I know I'm in Manhattan
423.463	so you guys can't see the stars,
425.877	but imagine you're out in the country, 
425.877	imagine you chose that rural life â€”
429.608	and we look at a star in December, we see that star
432.475	against the backdrop of distant stars.
435.24	If we now make the same observation six months later
438.194	when the Earth has moved to this position in June,
442.006	we look at that same star and we 
442.006	see it against a different backdrop.
446.105	That difference, that angular
446.105	difference, is the stellar parallax.
450.287	So this is a prediction that the Copernican model makes.
453.15	Astronomers looked for the stellar parallax
455.711	and they found nothing, nothing at all.
460.693	And many people argued that this proved 
460.693	that the Copernican model was false.
464.559	So what happened?
466.047	Well, in hindsight we can say 
466.047	that astronomers were making
468.73	two auxiliary hypotheses, both of which
471.277	we would now say were incorrect.
473.94	The first was an assumption 
473.94	about the size of the Earth's orbit.
477.575	Astronomers were assuming 
477.575	that the Earth's orbit was large
480.611	relative to the distance to the stars.
482.949	Today we would draw the picture more like this,
485.413	this comes from NASA,
486.76	and you see the Earth's orbit is actually quite small.
489.183	In fact, it's actually much
489.183	smaller even than shown here.
492.174	The stellar parallax therefore,
493.713	is very small and actually very hard to detect.
497.297	And that leads to the second reason
499.271	why the prediction didn't work,
501.13	because scientists were also assuming
503.045	that the telescopes they had were sensitive enough
506.055	to detect the parallax.
507.955	And that turned out not to be true.
509.972	It wasn't until the 19th century
512.506	that scientists were able to detect
514.19	the stellar parallax.
515.726	So, there's a third problem as well.
518.372	The third problem is simply a factual problem,
521.15	that a lot of science doesn't fit the textbook model.
523.966	A lot of science isn't deductive at all,
526.239	it's actually inductive.
528.007	And by that we mean that scientists don't necessarily
530.523	start with theories and hypotheses,
532.754	often they just start with observations
534.623	of stuff going on in the world.
537.032	And the most famous example
537.032	of that is one of the most
539.602	famous scientists who ever lived, Charles Darwin.
542.667	When Darwin went out as a young 
542.667	man on the voyage of the Beagle,
545.829	he didn't have a hypothesis, he didn't have a theory.
549.441	He just knew that he wanted
549.441	to have a career as a scientist
552.507	and he started to collect data.
554.519	Mainly he knew that he hated medicine
557.249	because the sight of blood made him sick so
559.067	he had to have an alternative career path.
561.335	So he started collecting data.
563.469	And he collected many things, 
563.469	including his famous finches.
566.635	When he collected these finches,
566.635	he threw them in a bag
568.845	and he had no idea what they meant.
571.185	Many years later back in London,
573.472	Darwin looked at his data again and began
575.705	to develop an explanation,
578.153	and that explanation was the
578.153	theory of natural selection.
581.451	Besides inductive science,
583.51	scientists also often participate in modeling.
586.446	One of the things scientists want to do in life
588.782	is to explain the causes of things.
591.05	And how do we do that?
592.568	Well, one way you can do it is to build a model
594.82	that tests an idea.
596.562	So this is a picture of Henry Cadell,
598.493	who was a Scottish geologist in the 19th century.
601.359	You can tell he's Scottish because he's wearing
602.792	a deerstalker cap and Wellington boots.
605.18	(Laughter)
607.334	And Cadell wanted to answer the question,
608.9	how are mountains formed?
610.668	And one of the things he had observed
612.184	is that if you look at mountains
612.184	like the Appalachians,
614.758	you often find that the rocks in them
616.391	are folded,
617.86	and they're folded in a particular way,
619.506	which suggested to him
620.95	that they were actually being
620.95	compressed from the side.
623.899	And this idea would later play a major role
625.987	in discussions of continental drift.
628.41	So he built this model, this crazy contraption
630.916	with levers and wood, and here's his wheelbarrow,
633.068	buckets, a big sledgehammer.
635.51	I don't know why he's got the Wellington boots.
637.408	Maybe it's going to rain.
638.985	And he created this physical model in order
642.07	to demonstrate that you could, in fact, create
646.035	patterns in rocks, or at least, in this case, in mud,
648.709	that looked a lot like mountains
650.935	if you compressed them from the side.
652.777	So it was an argument about
652.777	the cause of mountains.
656.405	Nowadays, most scientists prefer to work inside,
659.453	so they don't build physical models so much
661.88	as to make computer simulations.
664.241	But a computer simulation is a kind of a model.
667.08	It's a model that's made with mathematics,
668.943	and like the physical models of the 19th century,
672.176	it's very important for thinking about causes.
675.954	So one of the big questions
675.954	to do with climate change,
678.569	we have tremendous amounts of evidence
680.372	that the Earth is warming up.
682.252	This slide here, the black line shows
684.716	the measurements that scientists have taken
686.836	for the last 150 years
688.799	showing that the Earth's temperature
690.209	has steadily increased,
691.843	and you can see in particular
691.843	that in the last 50 years
694.689	there's been this dramatic increase
696.453	of nearly one degree centigrade,
698.793	or almost two degrees Fahrenheit.
701.168	So what, though, is driving that change?
703.605	How can we know what's causing
705.94	the observed warming?
707.456	Well, scientists can model it
709.17	using a computer simulation.
711.538	So this diagram illustrates a computer simulation
714.33	that has looked at all the different factors
716.451	that we know can influence the Earth's climate,
719.056	so sulfate particles from air pollution,
721.808	volcanic dust from volcanic eruptions,
724.778	changes in solar radiation,
727.012	and, of course, greenhouse gases.
729.39	And they asked the question,
731.208	what set of variables put into a model
734.904	will reproduce what we actually see in real life?
737.88	So here is the real life in black.
739.9	Here's the model in this light gray,
742.18	and the answer is
743.74	a model that includes, it's the answer E on that SAT,
748.127	all of the above.
750.268	The only way you can reproduce
751.774	the observed temperature measurements
753.602	is with all of these things put together,
755.58	including greenhouse gases,
757.719	and in particular you can see that the increase
760.27	in greenhouse gases tracks
762.154	this very dramatic increase in temperature
764.36	over the last 50 years.
765.84	And so this is why climate scientists say
768.274	it's not just that we know that
768.274	climate change is happening,
771.382	we know that greenhouse gases are a major part
774.15	of the reason why.
776.88	So now because there all these different things
779.268	that scientists do,
780.757	the philosopher Paul Feyerabend famously said,
784.243	"""The only principle in science"
785.869	"that doesn't inhibit progress is: anything goes."""
789.848	Now this quotation has often
789.848	been taken out of context,
792.464	because Feyerabend was not actually saying
794.582	that in science anything goes.
796.532	What he was saying was,
797.876	actually the full quotation is,
799.9	"""If you press me to say"
801.99	what is the method of science,
803.636	"I would have to say: anything goes."""
807.265	What he was trying to say
808.343	is that scientists do a lot of different things.
810.91	Scientists are creative.
813.218	But then this pushes the question back:
815.328	If scientists don't use a single method,
818.799	then how do they decide
820.698	what's right and what's wrong?
822.156	And who judges?
824.05	And the answer is, scientists judge,
826.13	and they judge by judging evidence.
829.013	Scientists collect evidence in many different ways,
832.422	but however they collect it,
834.044	they have to subject it to scrutiny.
836.621	And this led the sociologist Robert Merton
839.181	to focus on this question of how scientists
841.361	scrutinize data and evidence,
843.04	and he said they do it in a way he called
845.848	"""organized skepticism."""
847.767	And by that he meant it's organized
849.651	because they do it collectively,
851.129	they do it as a group,
852.758	and skepticism, because they do it from a position
855.574	of distrust.
857.028	That is to say, the burden of proof
858.99	is on the person with a novel claim.
861.471	And in this sense, science
861.471	is intrinsically conservative.
864.614	It's quite hard to persuade the scientific community
867.186	"to say, ""Yes, we know something, this is true."""
870.897	So despite the popularity of the concept
873.393	of paradigm shifts,
874.99	what we find is that actually,
876.274	really major changes in scientific thinking
879.059	are relatively rare in the history of science.
882.779	So finally that brings us to one more idea:
886.342	If scientists judge evidence collectively,
890.05	this has led historians to focus on the question
892.612	of consensus,
894.031	and to say that at the end of the day,
895.926	what science is,
897.86	what scientific knowledge is,
899.53	is the consensus of the scientific experts
902.909	who through this process of organized scrutiny,
905.063	collective scrutiny,
907.368	have judged the evidence
908.61	and come to a conclusion about it,
911.407	either yea or nay.
913.884	So we can think of scientific knowledge
915.608	as a consensus of experts.
917.66	We can also think of science as being
919.432	a kind of a jury,
921.01	except it's a very special kind of jury.
923.524	It's not a jury of your peers,
925.628	it's a jury of geeks.
927.524	It's a jury of men and women with Ph.D.s,
931.158	and unlike a conventional jury,
933.6	which has only two choices,
935.29	guilty or not guilty,
937.975	the scientific jury actually has a number of choices.
941.376	Scientists can say yes, something's true.
944.16	Scientists can say no, it's false.
946.74	Or, they can say, well it might be true
949.28	but we need to work more
949.28	and collect more evidence.
952.324	Or, they can say it might be true,
953.94	but we don't know how to answer the question
955.64	and we're going to put it aside
956.95	and maybe we'll come back to it later.
959.873	"That's what scientists call ""intractable."""
963.875	But this leads us to one final problem:
966.481	If science is what scientists say it is,
969.419	then isn't that just an appeal to authority?
971.96	And weren't we all taught in school
973.022	that the appeal to authority is a logical fallacy?
976.249	Well, here's the paradox of modern science,
979.281	the paradox of the conclusion I think historians
981.553	and philosophers and sociologists have come to,
984.154	that actually science is the appeal to authority,
987.655	but it's not the authority of the individual,
991.431	no matter how smart that individual is,
993.83	like Plato or Socrates or Einstein.
997.695	It's the authority of the collective community.
1000.809	You can think of it is a kind of wisdom of the crowd,
1003.795	but a very special kind of crowd.
1007.921	Science does appeal to authority,
1009.811	but it's not based on any individual,
1011.861	no matter how smart that individual may be.
1014.447	It's based on the collective wisdom,
1016.198	the collective knowledge, the collective work,
1018.84	of all of the scientists who have worked
1020.738	on a particular problem.
1023.455	Scientists have a kind of culture of collective distrust,
1026.251	"this ""show me"" culture,"
1028.451	illustrated by this nice woman here
1030.401	showing her colleagues her evidence.
1033.483	Of course, these people don't
1033.483	really look like scientists,
1035.34	because they're much too happy.
1037.326	(Laughter)
1041.338	Okay, so that brings me to my final point.
1045.66	Most of us get up in the morning.
1048.308	Most of us trust our cars.
1049.718	Well, see, now I'm thinking, I'm in Manhattan,
1051.26	this is a bad analogy,
1052.558	but most Americans who don't live in Manhattan
1055.382	get up in the morning and get in their cars
1057.12	and turn on that ignition, and their cars work,
1059.649	and they work incredibly well.
1061.65	The modern automobile hardly ever breaks down.
1064.365	So why is that? Why do cars work so well?
1067.148	It's not because of the genius of Henry Ford
1069.652	or Karl Benz or even Elon Musk.
1072.743	It's because the modern automobile
1074.885	is the product of more than 100 years of work
1079.919	by hundreds and thousands
1081.509	and tens of thousands of people.
1082.845	The modern automobile is the product
1084.956	of the collected work and wisdom and experience
1087.745	of every man and woman who has ever worked
1090.092	on a car,
1091.7	and the reliability of the technology is the result
1094.615	of that accumulated effort.
1097.298	We benefit not just from the genius of Benz
1100.155	and Ford and Musk
1101.221	but from the collective intelligence and hard work
1103.989	of all of the people who have worked
1106.24	on the modern car.
1107.91	And the same is true of science,
1109.96	only science is even older.
1112.804	Our basis for trust in science is actually the same
1115.378	as our basis in trust in technology,
1118.052	and the same as our basis for trust in anything,
1122.039	namely, experience.
1124.317	But it shouldn't be blind trust
1126.161	any more than we would have blind trust in anything.
1128.921	Our trust in science, like science itself,
1131.762	should be based on evidence,
1133.675	and that means that scientists
1135.177	have to become better communicators.
1137.225	They have to explain to us not just what they know
1140.112	but how they know it,
1141.84	and it means that we have
1141.84	to become better listeners.
1145.73	Thank you very much.
1147.149	(Applause)
