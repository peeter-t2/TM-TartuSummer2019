15.396	I've got a great idea
15.396	that's going to change the world.
18.04	It's fantastic, it's going
18.04	to blow your mind.
20.458	It's my beautiful baby.
21.883	Here's the thing:
21.883	everybody loves a beautiful baby.
24.336	I mean, I was a beautiful baby.
26.301	Here's me and my dad
26.301	a couple days after I was born.
28.801	So in the world of product design,
30.464	the beautiful baby's like the concept car.
32.856	It's the knockout.
34.766	"You see it and you go, ""Oh, my God."
34.766	"I'd buy that in a second!"""
37.929	So why is it that this year's new cars
40.324	look pretty much exactly
40.324	like last year's new cars?
43.612	(Laughter)
45.408	What went wrong between
45.408	the design studio and the factory?
48.25	Today, I don't want to talk
48.25	about beautiful babies,
50.678	I want to talk about the awkward
50.678	adolescence of design --
53.443	those sort of dorky teenage years
58.045	where you're trying to figure out
58.045	how the world works.
61.567	I'm going to start with an example
63.226	from some work that we did
63.226	on newborn health.
65.678	So here's a problem:
67.334	four million babies around the world,
67.334	mostly in developing countries,
71.373	die every year
71.373	before their first birthday,
73.758	even before their first month of life.
75.61	It turns out half of those kids,
77.294	or about 1.8 million newborns
77.294	around the world,
79.532	would make it if you could
79.532	just keep them warm
82.444	for the first three days,
82.444	maybe the first week.
85.19	So this is a newborn intensive care unit
85.19	in Kathmandu, Nepal.
88.915	All of these kids in blankets
88.915	belong in incubators --
91.648	something like this.
93.321	This is a donated Japanese Atom incubator
96.141	that we found in a NICU in Kathmandu.
99.385	This is what we want.
100.575	Probably what happened is a hospital
100.575	in Japan upgraded their equipment
103.933	and donated their old stuff to Nepal.
107.386	The problem is, without technicians,
107.386	without spare parts,
110.475	donations like this
110.475	very quickly turn into junk.
114.513	So this seemed like a problem
114.513	that we could do something about.
118.218	Keeping a baby warm for a week --
118.218	that's not rocket science.
122.016	So we got started.
123.423	We partnered with a leading medical
123.423	research institution here in Boston.
127.318	We conducted months
127.318	of user research overseas,
130.258	trying to think like designers,
130.258	human-centered design --
132.988	"""Let's figure out what people want."""
135.835	We killed thousands of Post-it notes.
137.952	We made dozens of prototypes
137.952	to get to this.
141.399	So this is the NeoNurture
141.399	infant incubator,
144.391	and this has a lot of smarts
144.391	built into it, and we felt great.
148.089	So the idea here is,
148.089	unlike the concept car,
150.427	we want to marry something beautiful
152.305	with something that actually works.
154.808	And our idea is that this design
156.919	would inspire manufacturers
156.919	and other people of influence
160.406	to take this model and run with it.
163.776	Here's the bad news:
166.457	the only baby ever actually put
166.457	inside the NeoNurture incubator
170.455	was this kid during a Time
170.455	magazine photo shoot.
174.328	So recognition is fantastic.
176.555	We want design to get out
176.555	for people to see it.
179.254	It won lots of awards.
181.144	But it felt like a booby prize.
184.166	We wanted to make beautiful things
185.89	that are going to make
185.89	the world a better place,
189.051	and I don't think this kid was even
189.051	in it long enough to get warm.
192.729	So it turns out that design 
192.729	for inspiration doesn't really ...
198.46	I guess what I would say is,
198.46	for us, for what I want to do,
202.01	it's either too slow or it just
202.01	doesn't work, it's ineffective.
205.444	So, really, I want to design for outcomes.
208.505	I don't want to make beautiful stuff;
208.505	I want to make the world a better place.
212.225	So when we were designing NeoNurture,
214.034	we paid a lot of attention to the people
214.034	who are going to use this thing,
217.499	for example, poor families, rural doctors,
220.126	overloaded nurses,
220.126	even repair technicians.
223.306	We thought we had all our bases
223.306	covered, we'd done everything right.
226.542	Well, it turns out there's this
226.542	whole constellation of people
229.432	who have to be involved
229.432	in a product for it to be successful:
232.319	manufacturing, financing,
232.319	distribution, regulation.
235.033	Michael Free at PATH
235.033	says you have to figure out
237.31	"who will ""choose, use and pay the dues"""
239.968	for a product like this.
241.282	And I have to ask the question
241.282	that VCs always ask:
243.75	"""Sir, what is your business,"
243.75	"and who is your customer?"""
246.624	Who is our customer?
248.389	Well, here's an example.
249.581	This is a Bangladeshi hospital director
249.581	outside his facility.
252.876	It turns out he doesn't buy
252.876	any of his equipment.
255.737	Those decisions are made
255.737	by the Ministry of Health
258.527	or by foreign donors,
259.875	and it just kind of shows up.
261.599	Similarly, here's a multinational
261.599	medical-device manufacturer.
265.114	It turns out they've got to fish
265.114	where the fish are.
268.048	So it turns out that in emerging
268.048	markets -- where the fish are --
271.409	are the emerging middle class
271.409	of these countries --
274.528	diseases of affluence:
274.528	heart disease, infertility.
278.006	So it turns out that design
278.006	for outcomes in one aspect
282.508	really means thinking about design
282.508	for manufacture and distribution.
286.056	OK, that was an important lesson.
288.267	Second, we took that lesson and tried
288.267	to push it into our next project.
292.457	So we started by finding a manufacturer,
294.99	an organization called MTTS in Vietnam,
297.312	that manufactures newborn-care
297.312	technologies for Southeast Asia.
300.734	Our other partner is East Meets West,
302.642	an American foundation
302.642	that distributes that technology
305.292	to poor hospitals around that region.
307.966	So we started with them, saying,
307.966	"""Well, what do you want?"
310.673	"What's a problem you want to solve?"""
312.426	"And they said, ""Let's work"
312.426	"on newborn jaundice."""
314.955	So this is another one of these
314.955	mind-boggling global problems.
319.041	Jaundice affects two-thirds
319.041	of newborns around the world.
322.804	Of those newborns, one in 10 roughly,
327.352	if it's not treated,
327.352	the jaundice gets so severe
329.856	that it leads to either
329.856	a life-long disability,
332.553	or the kids could even die.
335.59	There's one way to treat jaundice,
337.333	and that's what's called
337.333	an exchange transfusion.
339.897	So as you can imagine, that's expensive
339.897	and a little bit dangerous.
343.765	There is another cure.
345.574	It's very technological,
345.574	it's very complex, a little daunting.
351.241	You've got to shine blue light on the kid.
353.487	(Laughter)
354.573	Bright blue light on as much
354.573	of the skin as you can cover.
358.048	How is this a hard problem?
359.953	I went to MIT. OK, we'll figure that out.
365.618	(Laughter)
367.078	So here's an example.
368.269	This is an overhead phototherapy device
368.269	that's designed for American hospitals,
372.801	and here's how it's supposed to be used.
374.803	It's over the baby,
374.803	illuminating a single patient.
379.426	Take it out of an American hospital,
381.189	send it overseas
381.189	to a crowded facility in Asia,
383.422	here's how it's actually used.
384.898	The effectiveness of phototherapy
384.898	is a function of light intensity.
388.145	These dark blue squares show you
388.145	where it's effective phototherapy.
391.576	Here's what it looks
391.576	like under actual use.
393.631	So those kids on the edges aren't actually
393.631	receiving effective phototherapy.
397.336	But without training,
397.336	without some kind of light meter,
400.786	how would you know?
402.596	We see other examples
402.596	of problems like this.
404.681	Here's a neonatal intensive care unit,
406.527	where moms come in to visit their babies.
408.513	And keep in mind that Mom
408.513	maybe just had a C-section,
411.032	so that's already kind of a bummer.
412.922	Mom's visiting her kid.
414.319	She sees her baby naked,
414.319	lying under some blue lights,
417.478	looking kind of vulnerable.
419.617	It's not uncommon for Mom
419.617	to put a blanket over the baby.
423.474	From a phototherapy standpoint,
423.474	maybe not the best behavior.
427.372	In fact, that sounds kind of dumb.
429.27	Except, what we've learned is that
429.27	there's no such thing as a dumb user --
434.084	there are only dumb products.
436.77	We have to think like existentialists:
438.632	it's not the painting
438.632	we would have painted,
440.72	it's the painting
440.72	that we actually painted.
442.759	It's the use -- designed for actual use.
445.293	How are people actually going to use this?
447.737	So, similarly, when we think
447.737	about our partner MTTS,
450.841	they've made some amazing technologies
450.841	for treating newborn illnesses.
454.293	So here's an overhead warmer and a CPAP.
456.626	They're inexpensive, really rugged.
459.395	They've treated 50,000 kids
459.395	in Vietnam with this technology.
462.256	But here's the problem:
463.637	Every doctor in the world,
463.637	every hospital administrator,
466.464	"has seen TV -- curse those ""ER"" reruns!"
471.74	Turns out they all know what a medical
471.74	device is supposed to look like.
475.897	They want Buck Rogers,
475.897	they don't want effective.
479.309	It sounds crazy, it sounds dumb,
481.091	but there are actually hospitals
481.091	who would rather have no equipment
484.282	than something that looks
484.282	cheap and crummy.
486.362	So again, if we want
486.362	people to trust a device,
489.68	it has to look trustworthy.
491.112	So thinking about outcomes,
492.627	it turns out appearances matter.
495.028	We took all that information together.
497.559	We tried, this time, to get it right.
499.914	And here's what we developed.
501.326	This is the Firefly phototherapy device,
503.286	except this time,
503.286	we didn't stop at the concept car.
506.947	From the very beginning, we started
506.947	by talking to manufacturers.
510.225	Our goal is to make
510.225	a state-of-the-art product
513.393	that our partner MTTS
513.393	can actually manufacture.
516.099	Our goal is to study how they work,
516.099	the resources they have access to,
520.21	so that they can make this product.
522.765	So that's the design
522.765	for manufacture question.
525.28	When we think about actual use,
527.139	you'll notice that Firefly
527.139	has a single bassinet.
529.472	It only fits a single baby,
531.369	and the idea here is it's obvious
531.369	how you ought to use this device.
535.427	If you try to put more than one kid in,
537.324	you're stacking them on top of each other.
539.377	(Laughter)
541.033	So the idea here is you want
541.033	to make it hard to use wrong.
543.828	In other words, you want to make
543.828	the right way to use it
546.519	the easiest way to use it.
548.481	Another example -- again, silly Mom.
551.517	Silly Mom thinks her baby looks cold,
551.517	wants to put a blanket over the baby.
555.094	That's why we have lights
555.094	above and below the baby in Firefly,
558.04	so if Mom does put a blanket
558.04	over the baby,
560.101	it's still receiving effective
560.101	phototherapy from below.
563.896	Last story here:
565.238	I've got a friend in India who told me
567.157	that you haven't really tested
567.157	a piece of electronic technology
570.162	for distribution in Asia,
572.228	until you've trained a cockroach
572.228	to climb in and pee
574.697	on every single little
574.697	component on the inside.
577.173	(Laughter)
578.981	You think it's funny.
580.364	I had a laptop in the Peace Corps,
582.602	and the screen had all these
582.602	dead pixels on it.
584.83	And one day I looked in --
584.83	they were all dead ants
587.639	that had gotten
587.639	into my laptop and perished.
589.727	Those poor ants.
590.902	(Laughter)
592.466	So with Firefly, what we did is --
592.466	the problem is electronics get hot,
596.054	and you have to put in vents
596.054	or fans to keep them cool --
598.8	in most products.
600.068	"We decided we can't put a ""Do not enter"""
600.068	sign next to the vent.
604.877	We actually got rid of all that stuff.
606.9	So Firefly's totally sealed.
608.625	These are the kinds of lessons --
610.241	as awkward as it was
610.241	to be a pretty goofy teenager,
612.901	much worse to be a frustrated designer.
614.908	"So I was thinking, ""What I really"
614.908	want to do is change the world.
618.042	I have to pay attention
618.042	to manufacturing and distribution.
620.809	I have to pay attention to how people
620.809	are actually going to use a device.
624.824	I actually have to pay attention.
624.824	There's no excuse for failure.
627.864	I have to think like an existentialist.
629.762	I have to accept that there
629.762	"are no dumb users, only dumb products."""
633.026	We have to ask ourselves hard questions.
635.42	Are we designing
635.42	for the world that we want?
638.5	Are we designing
638.5	for the world that we have?
641.166	Are we designing
641.166	for the world that's coming,
643.304	whether we're ready or not?
644.622	I got into this business
644.622	designing products.
648.022	I've since learned that if you really want
648.022	to make a difference in the world,
651.709	you have to design outcomes.
653.496	And that's design that matters.
655.061	Thank you.
656.237	(Applause)
