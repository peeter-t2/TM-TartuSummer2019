13.713	Can I get a show of hands --
15.103	how many of you in this room
15.103	have been on a plane in this past year?
20.258	That's pretty good.
21.435	Well, it turns out that you
21.435	share that experience
24.344	with more than three billion
24.344	people every year.
27.203	And when we put so many people
27.203	in all these metal tubes
30.364	that fly all over the world,
31.974	sometimes, things like this can happen
34.671	and you get a disease epidemic.
37.116	I first actually got into this topic
39.091	when I heard about the Ebola
39.091	outbreak last year.
41.747	And it turns out that,
43.231	although Ebola spreads
43.231	through these more range-limited,
46.085	large-droplet routes,
47.443	there's all these other sorts of diseases
49.445	that can be spread in the airplane cabin.
51.445	The worst part is, when we take
51.445	a look at some of the numbers,
54.653	it's pretty scary.
56.09	So with H1N1,
57.874	there was this guy that decided
57.874	to go on the plane
60.287	and in the matter of a single flight
62.082	actually spread the disease
62.082	to 17 other people.
64.36	And then there was this
64.36	other guy with SARS,
66.512	who managed to go on a three-hour flight
68.638	and spread the disease to 22 other people.
71.504	That's not exactly my idea
71.504	of a great superpower.
75.658	When we take a look at this,
75.658	what we also find
78.246	is that it's very difficult
78.246	to pre-screen for these diseases.
81.619	So when someone actually
81.619	goes on a plane,
83.734	they could be sick
84.964	and they could actually
84.964	be in this latency period
87.383	in which they could actually
87.383	have the disease
89.566	but not exhibit any symptoms,
91.162	and they could, in turn,
91.162	spread the disease
93.377	to many other people in the cabin.
95.074	How that actually works is that right now
97.18	we've got air coming in
97.18	from the top of the cabin
99.49	and from the side of the cabin,
99.49	as you see in blue.
101.94	And then also, that air goes out
101.94	through these very efficient filters
106.166	that eliminate 99.97 percent
106.166	of pathogens near the outlets.
111.444	What happens right now, though,
112.945	is that we have this
112.945	mixing airflow pattern.
115.036	So if someone were to actually sneeze,
116.892	that air would get swirled
116.892	around multiple times
119.62	before it even has a chance
119.62	to go out through the filter.
123.785	So I thought: clearly, this
123.785	is a pretty serious problem.
127.022	I didn't have the money
127.022	to go out and buy a plane,
130.779	so I decided to build a computer instead.
133.041	It actually turns out that
133.041	with computational fluid dynamics,
136.337	what we're able to do
136.337	is create these simulations
138.962	that give us higher resolutions
140.78	than actually physically going
140.78	in and taking readings in the plane.
144.836	And so how, essentially, this works
144.836	is you would start out
147.874	with these 2D drawings --
149.57	these are floating around
149.57	in technical papers around the Internet.
152.722	I take that and then I put it
152.722	into this 3D-modeling software,
155.639	really building that 3D model.
157.442	And then I divide that model
157.442	that I just built into these tiny pieces,
161.925	essentially meshing it so that
161.925	the computer can better understand it.
165.526	And then I tell the computer where
165.526	the air goes in and out of the cabin,
169.271	throw in a bunch of physics
170.794	and basically sit there and wait until
170.794	the computer calculates the simulation.
176.015	So what we get, actually,
176.015	with the conventional cabin is this:
179.666	you'll notice the middle person sneezing,
182.767	"and we go ""Splat!"" -- it goes"
182.767	right into people's faces.
186.882	It's pretty disgusting.
188.727	From the front, you'll notice
188.727	those two passengers
191.099	sitting next to the central passenger
192.909	not exactly having a great time.
194.639	And when we take a look
194.639	at that from the side,
196.849	you'll also notice those pathogens
196.849	spreading across the length of the cabin.
202.017	The first thing I thought was,
202.017	"""This is no good."""
204.391	So I actually conducted
204.391	more than 32 different simulations
207.923	and ultimately, I came up
207.923	with this solution right here.
211.312	This is what I call a -- patent pending --
211.312	Global Inlet Director.
214.852	With this, we're able to reduce
214.852	pathogen transmission
217.442	by about 55 times,
219.234	and increase fresh-air inhalation
219.234	by about 190 percent.
222.411	So how this actually works
224.039	is we would install this piece
224.039	of composite material
227.192	into these existing spots
227.192	that are already in the plane.
230.184	So it's very cost-effective to install
232.209	and we can do this directly overnight.
234.081	All we have to do is put a couple
234.081	of screws in there and you're good to go.
237.653	And the results that we get
237.653	are absolutely amazing.
240.536	Instead of having those problematic
240.536	swirling airflow patterns,
244.096	we can create these walls of air
245.862	that come down in-between the passengers
248.056	to create personalized breathing zones.
249.978	So you'll notice the middle passenger
249.978	here is sneezing again,
252.987	but this time, we're able
252.987	to effectively push that down
255.724	to the filters for elimination.
258.461	And same thing from the side,
259.881	you'll notice we're able to directly
259.881	push those pathogens down.
263.682	So if you take a look again now
263.682	at the same scenario
267.2	but with this innovation installed,
268.913	you'll notice the middle
268.913	passenger sneezes,
270.953	and this time, we're pushing
270.953	that straight down into the outlet
274.05	before it gets a chance
274.05	to infect any other people.
277.795	So you'll notice the two passengers
277.795	sitting next to the middle guy
280.943	are breathing virtually
280.943	no pathogens at all.
283.2	Take a look at that from the side as well,
285.752	you see a very efficient system.
287.331	And in short, with this system, we win.
291.255	When we take a look at what this means,
294.168	what we see is that this not only works
294.168	if the middle passenger sneezes,
297.664	but also if the window-seat
297.664	passenger sneezes
300.462	or if the aisle-seat passenger sneezes.
303.167	And so with this solution, what does
303.167	this mean for the world?
306.278	Well, when we take a look at this
309.816	from the computer simulation
309.816	into real life,
312.409	we can see with this 3D model
312.409	that I built over here,
315.195	essentially using 3D printing,
317.307	we can see those same
317.307	airflow patterns coming down,
320.29	right to the passengers.
322.92	In the past, the SARS epidemic
322.92	actually cost the world
326.014	about 40 billion dollars.
327.967	And in the future,
329.15	a big disease outbreak
329.15	could actually cost the world
331.72	in excess of three trillion dollars.
333.942	So before, it used to be that you had
333.942	to take an airplane out of service
337.443	for one to two months,
339.339	spend tens of thousands of man hours
339.339	and several million dollars
342.935	to try to change something.
344.282	But now, we're able to install
344.282	something essentially overnight
347.817	and see results right away.
349.568	So it's really now a matter of taking
349.568	this through to certification,
352.798	flight testing,
354.012	and going through all of these
354.012	regulatory approvals processes.
357.028	But it just really goes to show
357.028	that sometimes the best solutions
360.116	are the simplest solutions.
361.935	And two years ago, even,
365.149	this project would not have happened,
366.942	just because the technology then
366.942	wouldn't have supported it.
369.792	But now with advanced computing
372.285	and how developed our Internet is,
374.495	it's really the golden era for innovation.
377.158	And so the question I ask all
377.158	of you today is: why wait?
380.425	Together, we can build the future today.
383.123	Thanks.
384.298	(Applause)
