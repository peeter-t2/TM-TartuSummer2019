15.865	I essentially drag sledges for a living,
17.619	so it doesn't take an awful lot to flummox me intellectually,
20.803	but I'm going to read this question
22.345	from an interview earlier this year:
24.812	"""Philosophically, does the constant supply of information"
28.204	steal our ability to imagine
30.939	or replace our dreams of achieving?
33.755	After all, if it is being done somewhere by someone,
36.541	and we can participate virtually,
38.844	"then why bother leaving the house?"""
42.345	I'm usually introduced as a polar explorer.
44.994	I'm not sure that's the most progressive or 21st-century
47.295	of job titles, but I've spent more than two percent now
52.061	of my entire life living in a tent inside the Arctic Circle,
55.789	so I get out of the house a fair bit.
59.316	And in my nature, I guess, I am a doer of things
62.863	more than I am a spectator or a contemplator of things,
67.355	and it's that dichotomy, the gulf between ideas and action
71.579	that I'm going to try and explore briefly.
74.445	"The pithiest answer to the question ""why?"""
77.778	that's been dogging me for the last 12 years
80.146	was credited certainly to this chap, the rakish-looking gentleman
82.93	standing at the back, second from the left,
85.186	George Lee Mallory. Many of you will know his name.
87.824	In 1924 he was last seen disappearing into the clouds
91.813	near the summit of Mt. Everest.
93.487	He may or may not have been the first person to climb Everest,
96.742	more than 30 years before Edmund Hillary.
98.718	No one knows if he got to the top. It's still a mystery.
101.414	"But he was credited with coining the phrase, ""Because it's there."""
104.483	Now I'm not actually sure that he did say that.
107.173	There's very little evidence to suggest it, but what he did say
109.499	is actually far nicer,
111.979	and again, I've printed this. I'm going to read it out.
115.033	"""The first question which you will ask"
116.987	and which I must try to answer is this:
119.484	What is the use of climbing Mt. Everest?
123.26	And my answer must at once be, it is no use.
125.948	There is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever.
129.709	Oh, we may learn a little about the behavior
131.582	of the human body at high altitudes,
133.664	and possibly medical men may turn our observation
136.328	to some account for the purposes of aviation,
139.357	but otherwise nothing will come of it.
141.557	We shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver,
143.943	and not a gem, nor any coal or iron.
146.542	We shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted
149.341	with crops to raise food. So it is no use.
153.483	If you cannot understand that there is something in man
155.142	which responds to the challenge of this mountain
157.814	and goes out to meet it, that the struggle
161.037	is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward,
165.491	then you won't see why we go.
168.739	What we get from this adventure is just sheer joy,
171.868	and joy, after all, is the end of life.
174.802	We don't live to eat and make money.
177.005	We eat and make money to be able to enjoy life.
179.467	"That is what life means, and that is what life is for."""
184.375	Mallory's argument that leaving the house,
187.829	embarking on these grand adventures is joyful and fun,
190.272	however, doesn't tally that neatly with my own experience.
194.178	The furthest I've ever got away from my front door
197.58	was in the spring of 2004. I still don't know exactly
200.724	what came over me, but my plan was to make
203.231	a solo and unsupported crossing of the Arctic Ocean.
207.474	I planned essentially to walk from the north coast of Russia
210.031	to the North Pole, and then to carry on to the north coast of Canada.
213.363	No one had ever done this. I was 26 at the time.
216.271	A lot of experts were saying it was impossible,
218.523	and my mum certainly wasn't very keen on the idea.
221.877	(Laughter)
224.23	The journey from a small weather station on the north coast
227.156	of Siberia up to my final starting point,
229.341	the edge of the pack ice, the coast of the Arctic Ocean,
231.893	took about five hours, and if anyone watched fearless
235.354	Felix Baumgartner going up, rather than just coming down,
238.666	you'll appreciate the sense of apprehension,
241.27	as I sat in a helicopter thundering north,
244.582	and the sense, I think if anything, of impending doom.
247.239	I sat there wondering what on Earth I had gotten myself into.
250.929	There was a bit of fun, a bit of joy.
252.973	I was 26. I remember sitting there
254.814	looking down at my sledge. I had my skis ready to go,
257.406	I had a satellite phone, a pump-action shotgun
259.647	in case I was attacked by a polar bear.
261.67	I remember looking out of the window and seeing the second helicopter.
263.961	We were both thundering through this incredible Siberian dawn,
267.447	and part of me felt a bit like a cross between Jason Bourne
270.312	and Wilfred Thesiger. Part of me
273.204	felt quite proud of myself, but mostly I was just utterly terrified.
279.526	And that journey lasted 10 weeks, 72 days.
281.616	I didn't see anyone else. We took this photo next to the helicopter.
284.115	Beyond that, I didn't see anyone for 10 weeks.
286.674	The North Pole is slap bang in the middle of the sea,
288.616	so I'm traveling over the frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean.
291.877	NASA described conditions that year as the worst since records began.
295.987	I was dragging 180 kilos of food and fuel and supplies,
299.643	about 400 pounds. The average temperature for the 10 weeks
302.244	was minus 35. Minus 50 was the coldest.
304.935	So again, there wasn't an awful lot of joy or fun to be had.
312.214	One of the magical things about this journey, however,
313.747	is that because I'm walking over the sea,
315.85	over this floating, drifting, shifting crust of ice
319.912	that's floating on top of the Arctic Ocean is
322.107	it's an environment that's in a constant state of flux.
324.055	The ice is always moving, breaking up, drifting around,
326.401	refreezing, so the scenery that I saw for nearly 3 months
329.861	was unique to me. No one else will ever, could ever,
333.308	possibly see the views, the vistas, that I saw for 10 weeks.
338.337	And that, I guess, is probably the finest argument for leaving the house.
342.3	I can try to tell you what it was like,
346.182	but you'll never know what it was like,
348.027	and the more I try to explain that I felt lonely,
350.955	I was the only human being in 5.4 million square-miles,
354.674	it was cold, nearly minus 75 with windchill on a bad day,
358.979	the more words fall short, and I'm unable to do it justice.
362.811	And it seems to me, therefore, that the doing,
367.002	you know, to try to experience, to engage, to endeavor,
372.3	rather than to watch and to wonder, that's where
377.686	the real meat of life is to be found,
379.912	the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days.
383.856	And I would add a cautionary note here, however.
386.339	In my experience, there is something addictive
388.427	about tasting life at the very edge of what's humanly possible.
392.866	Now I don't just mean in the field of
395.101	daft macho Edwardian style derring-do,
397.388	but also in the fields of pancreatic cancer,
399.581	there is something addictive about this, and in my case,
401.488	I think polar expeditions are perhaps not that far removed
404.038	from having a crack habit.
405.42	I can't explain quite how good it is until you've tried it,
409.125	but it has the capacity to burn up all the money I can get my hands on,
412.942	to ruin every relationship I've ever had,
416.52	so be careful what you wish for.
420.921	Mallory postulated that there is something in man
423.302	that responds to the challenge of the mountain,
425.942	and I wonder if that's the case whether there's something
427.968	in the challenge itself, in the endeavor, and particularly
431.025	in the big, unfinished, chunky challenges that face humanity
434.137	that call out to us, and in my experience that's certainly the case.
438.453	There is one unfinished challenge
440.233	that's been calling out to me for most of my adult life.
443.505	Many of you will know the story.
444.933	This is a photo of Captain Scott and his team.
447.524	Scott set out just over a hundred years ago to try
449.397	to become the first person to reach the South Pole.
452.664	No one knew what was there. It was utterly unmapped
454.488	at the time. We knew more about the surface of the moon
456.513	than we did about the heart of Antarctica.
459.26	Scott, as many of you will know, was beaten to it
462.176	by Roald Amundsen and his Norwegian team,
464.469	who used dogs and dogsleds. Scott's team were on foot,
466.824	all five of them wearing harnesses and dragging around sledges,
469.245	and they arrived at the pole to find the Norwegian flag already there,
473.677	I'd imagine pretty bitter and demoralized.
476.935	All five of them turned and started walking back to the coast
479.205	and all five died on that return journey.
482.793	There is a sort of misconception nowadays that
485.027	it's all been done in the fields of exploration and adventure.
488.653	When I talk about Antarctica, people often say,
489.94	"""Hasn't, you know, that's interesting,"
491.23	"hasn't that Blue Peter presenter just done it on a bike?"""
494.423	"Or, ""That's nice. You know, my grandmother's going"
498.013	on a cruise to Antarctica next year. You know.
500.643	"Is there a chance you'll see her there?"""
503.509	(Laughter)
505.327	But Scott's journey remains unfinished.
508.541	No one has ever walked from the very coast of Antarctica
510.868	to the South Pole and back again.
512.665	It is, arguably, the most audacious endeavor
515.439	of that Edwardian golden age of exploration,
518.064	and it seemed to me high time, given everything
520.617	we have figured out in the century since
522.538	from scurvy to solar panels, that it was high time
526.119	someone had a go at finishing the job.
527.896	So that's precisely what I'm setting out to do.
530.592	This time next year, in October, I'm leading a team of three.
533.16	It will take us about four months to make this return journey.
536.019	That's the scale. The red line is obviously halfway to the pole.
539.072	We have to turn around and come back again.
540.466	I'm well aware of the irony of telling you that we will be
542.713	blogging and tweeting. You'll be able to live
545.448	vicariously and virtually through this journey
547.881	in a way that no one has ever before.
550.888	And it'll also be a four-month chance for me to finally
553.471	"come up with a pithy answer to the question, ""Why?"""
557.345	And our lives today are safer and more comfortable
562.278	than they have ever been. There certainly isn't much call
564.86	for explorers nowadays. My career advisor at school
568.718	never mentioned it as an option.
571.359	If I wanted to know, for example,
573.781	how many stars were in the Milky Way,
576.077	how old those giant heads on Easter Island were,
578.656	most of you could find that out right now
580.781	without even standing up.
583.607	And yet, if I've learned anything in nearly 12 years now
586.372	of dragging heavy things around cold places,
589.459	it is that true, real inspiration and growth
593.418	only comes from adversity and from challenge,
597.678	from stepping away from what's comfortable and familiar
600.694	and stepping out into the unknown.
603.175	In life, we all have tempests to ride and poles to walk to,
606.716	and I think metaphorically speaking, at least,
608.525	we could all benefit from getting outside the house
611.395	a little more often, if only we could summon up the courage.
615.276	I certainly would implore you to open the door just a little bit
618.501	and take a look at what's outside.
621.397	Thank you very much.
622.625	(Applause)
