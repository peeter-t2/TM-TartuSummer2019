12.528	So in 1885, Karl Benz
12.528	invented the automobile.
16.707	Later that year, he took it out
16.707	for the first public test drive,
20.469	and -- true story --
20.469	crashed into a wall.
24.184	For the last 130 years,
26.227	we've been working around that least
26.227	reliable part of the car, the driver.
30.546	We've made the car stronger.
32.2	We've added seat belts,
32.2	we've added air bags,
34.748	and in the last decade, we've actually
34.748	started trying to make the car smarter
38.719	to fix that bug, the driver.
41.657	Now, today I'm going to talk to you
41.657	a little bit about the difference
44.918	between patching around the problem
44.918	with driver assistance systems
48.726	and actually having fully
48.726	self-driving cars
51.29	and what they can do for the world.
53.17	I'm also going to talk to you
53.17	a little bit about our car
56.165	and allow you to see how it sees the world
56.165	and how it reacts and what it does,
60.164	but first I'm going to talk
60.164	a little bit about the problem.
63.651	And it's a big problem:
65.299	1.2 million people are killed
65.299	on the world's roads every year.
68.388	In America alone, 33,000 people
68.388	are killed each year.
72.172	To put that in perspective,
74.2	that's the same as a 737
74.2	falling out of the sky every working day.
79.342	It's kind of unbelievable.
81.548	Cars are sold to us like this,
83.846	but really, this is what driving's like.
86.563	Right? It's not sunny, it's rainy,
88.722	and you want to do anything
88.722	other than drive.
91.21	And the reason why is this:
92.832	Traffic is getting worse.
94.69	In America, between 1990 and 2010,
98.196	the vehicle miles traveled
98.196	increased by 38 percent.
102.213	We grew by six percent of roads,
104.962	so it's not in your brains.
106.564	Traffic really is substantially worse
106.564	than it was not very long ago.
110.84	And all of this has a very human cost.
113.529	So if you take the average commute time
113.529	in America, which is about 50 minutes,
117.477	you multiply that by the 120 million
117.477	workers we have,
121.126	that turns out to be
121.126	about six billion minutes
123.351	wasted in commuting every day.
125.377	Now, that's a big number,
125.377	so let's put it in perspective.
128.204	You take that six billion minutes
129.978	and you divide it by the average
129.978	life expectancy of a person,
133.762	that turns out to be 162 lifetimes
136.897	spent every day, wasted,
139.822	just getting from A to B.
141.866	It's unbelievable.
143.596	And then, there are those of us
143.596	who don't have the privilege
146.44	of sitting in traffic.
148.112	So this is Steve.
149.69	He's an incredibly capable guy,
151.455	but he just happens to be blind,
153.971	and that means instead of a 30-minute
153.971	drive to work in the morning,
157.188	it's a two-hour ordeal
157.188	of piecing together bits of public transit
161.167	or asking friends and family for a ride.
163.552	He doesn't have that same freedom
163.552	that you and I have to get around.
167.221	We should do something about that.
169.891	Now, conventional wisdom would say
171.648	that we'll just take
171.648	these driver assistance systems
174.14	and we'll kind of push them
174.14	and incrementally improve them,
177.89	and over time, they'll turn
177.89	into self-driving cars.
180.432	Well, I'm here to tell you
180.432	that's like me saying
182.841	that if I work really hard at jumping,
182.841	one day I'll be able to fly.
186.898	We actually need to do
186.898	something a little different.
189.626	And so I'm going to talk to you
189.626	about three different ways
192.337	that self-driving systems are different
192.337	than driver assistance systems.
195.683	And I'm going to start
195.683	with some of our own experience.
198.334	So back in 2013,
200.587	we had the first test
200.587	of a self-driving car
203.25	where we let regular people use it.
205.277	Well, almost regular --
205.277	they were 100 Googlers,
207.479	but they weren't working on the project.
209.482	And we gave them the car and we allowed
209.482	them to use it in their daily lives.
213.103	But unlike a real self-driving car,
213.103	this one had a big asterisk with it:
216.822	They had to pay attention,
218.326	because this was an experimental vehicle.
220.959	We tested it a lot,
220.959	but it could still fail.
224.484	And so we gave them two hours of training,
226.543	we put them in the car,
226.543	we let them use it,
228.635	and what we heard back
228.635	was something awesome,
230.762	as someone trying
230.762	to bring a product into the world.
233.286	Every one of them told us they loved it.
235.211	In fact, we had a Porsche driver
235.211	who came in and told us on the first day,
238.777	"""This is completely stupid."
238.777	"What are we thinking?"""
241.85	But at the end of it, he said,
241.85	"""Not only should I have it,"
244.69	everyone else should have it,
244.69	"because people are terrible drivers."""
249.135	So this was music to our ears,
250.87	but then we started to look at what
250.87	the people inside the car were doing,
254.673	and this was eye-opening.
256.252	Now, my favorite story is this gentleman
258.69	who looks down at his phone
258.69	and realizes the battery is low,
262.519	so he turns around like this in the car
262.519	and digs around in his backpack,
267.067	pulls out his laptop,
269.22	puts it on the seat,
270.787	goes in the back again,
272.551	digs around, pulls out
272.551	the charging cable for his phone,
275.918	futzes around, puts it into the laptop,
275.918	puts it on the phone.
279.285	Sure enough, the phone is charging.
281.328	All the time he's been doing
285.322	Right? Unbelievable.
287.806	So we thought about this and we said,
287.806	it's kind of obvious, right?
290.927	The better the technology gets,
293.19	the less reliable
293.19	the driver is going to get.
295.311	So by just making the cars
295.311	incrementally smarter,
297.707	we're probably not going to see
297.707	the wins we really need.
300.609	Let me talk about something
300.609	a little technical for a moment here.
304.51	So we're looking at this graph,
304.51	and along the bottom
306.948	is how often does the car
306.948	apply the brakes when it shouldn't.
309.999	You can ignore most of that axis,
311.62	because if you're driving around town,
311.62	and the car starts stopping randomly,
315.339	you're never going to buy that car.
317.04	And the vertical axis is how often
317.04	the car is going to apply the brakes
320.415	when it's supposed to
320.415	to help you avoid an accident.
323.464	Now, if we look at
323.464	the bottom left corner here,
325.685	this is your classic car.
327.53	It doesn't apply the brakes for you,
327.53	it doesn't do anything goofy,
330.663	but it also doesn't get you
330.663	out of an accident.
333.442	Now, if we want to bring
333.442	a driver assistance system into a car,
336.46	say with collision mitigation braking,
338.288	we're going to put some package
338.288	of technology on there,
340.9	and that's this curve, and it's going
340.9	to have some operating properties,
344.318	but it's never going to avoid
344.318	all of the accidents,
346.808	because it doesn't have that capability.
348.867	But we'll pick some place
348.867	along the curve here,
351.116	and maybe it avoids half of accidents
351.116	that the human driver misses,
354.37	and that's amazing, right?
355.667	We just reduced accidents on our roads
355.667	by a factor of two.
358.394	There are now 17,000 less people
358.394	dying every year in America.
362.381	But if we want a self-driving car,
364.401	we need a technology curve
364.401	that looks like this.
366.708	We're going to have to put
366.708	more sensors in the vehicle,
369.307	and we'll pick some
369.307	operating point up here
371.328	where it basically never
371.328	gets into a crash.
373.347	They'll happen, but very low frequency.
375.79	Now you and I could look at this
375.79	and we could argue
378.251	about whether it's incremental, and
378.251	"I could say something like ""80-20 rule,"""
381.856	and it's really hard to move up
381.856	to that new curve.
384.424	But let's look at it
384.424	from a different direction for a moment.
387.358	So let's look at how often
387.358	the technology has to do the right thing.
390.87	And so this green dot up here
390.87	is a driver assistance system.
394.376	It turns out that human drivers
396.861	make mistakes that lead
396.861	to traffic accidents
399.508	about once every 100,000 miles in America.
402.68	In contrast, a self-driving system
402.68	is probably making decisions
405.847	about 10 times per second,
409.51	so order of magnitude,
410.932	that's about 1,000 times per mile.
413.764	So if you compare the distance
413.764	between these two,
416.249	it's about 10 to the eighth, right?
418.849	Eight orders of magnitude.
420.614	That's like comparing how fast I run
423.423	to the speed of light.
425.629	It doesn't matter how hard I train,
425.629	I'm never actually going to get there.
429.414	So there's a pretty big gap there.
431.852	And then finally, there's how
431.852	the system can handle uncertainty.
435.581	So this pedestrian here might be
435.581	stepping into the road, might not be.
438.904	I can't tell,
438.904	nor can any of our algorithms,
442.31	but in the case of
442.31	a driver assistance system,
444.594	that means it can't take action,
444.594	because again,
447.4	if it presses the brakes unexpectedly,
447.4	that's completely unacceptable.
450.739	Whereas a self-driving system
450.739	can look at that pedestrian and say,
453.872	I don't know what they're about to do,
455.762	slow down, take a better look,
455.762	and then react appropriately after that.
459.524	So it can be much safer than
459.524	a driver assistance system can ever be.
463.226	So that's enough about
463.226	the differences between the two.
465.956	Let's spend some time talking about
465.956	how the car sees the world.
469.44	So this is our vehicle.
470.692	It starts by understanding
470.692	where it is in the world,
473.13	by taking a map and its sensor data
473.13	and aligning the two,
475.917	and then we layer on top of that
475.917	what it sees in the moment.
478.865	So here, all the purple boxes you can see
478.865	are other vehicles on the road,
482.52	and the red thing on the side
482.52	over there is a cyclist,
485.048	and up in the distance,
485.048	if you look really closely,
487.45	you can see some cones.
489.244	Then we know where the car
489.244	is in the moment,
492.017	but we have to do better than that:
492.017	we have to predict what's going to happen.
495.85	So here the pickup truck in top right
495.85	is about to make a left lane change
499.338	because the road in front of it is closed,
501.561	so it needs to get out of the way.
503.292	Knowing that one pickup truck is great,
505.155	but we really need to know
505.155	what everybody's thinking,
507.634	so it becomes quite a complicated problem.
510.141	And then given that, we can figure out
510.141	how the car should respond in the moment,
514.89	so what trajectory it should follow, how
514.89	quickly it should slow down or speed up.
518.756	And then that all turns into
518.756	just following a path:
521.821	turning the steering wheel left or right,
521.821	pressing the brake or gas.
525.018	It's really just two numbers
525.018	at the end of the day.
527.482	So how hard can it really be?
530.433	Back when we started in 2009,
532.385	this is what our system looked like.
534.183	So you can see our car in the middle
534.183	and the other boxes on the road,
537.574	driving down the highway.
538.845	The car needs to understand where it is
538.845	and roughly where the other vehicles are.
542.663	It's really a geometric
542.663	understanding of the world.
545.092	Once we started driving
545.092	on neighborhood and city streets,
548.04	the problem becomes a whole
548.04	new level of difficulty.
550.485	You see pedestrians crossing in front
550.485	of us, cars crossing in front of us,
553.979	going every which way,
555.79	the traffic lights, crosswalks.
557.317	It's an incredibly complicated
557.317	problem by comparison.
560.114	And then once you have
560.114	that problem solved,
562.217	the vehicle has to be able
562.217	to deal with construction.
564.729	So here are the cones on the left
564.729	forcing it to drive to the right,
567.88	but not just construction
567.88	in isolation, of course.
570.282	It has to deal with other people moving
570.282	through that construction zone as well.
574.005	And of course, if anyone's
574.005	breaking the rules, the police are there
577.268	and the car has to understand that
577.268	that flashing light on the top of the car
580.89	means that it's not just a car,
580.89	it's actually a police officer.
583.995	Similarly, the orange box
583.995	on the side here,
586.027	it's a school bus,
587.136	and we have to treat that
587.136	differently as well.
590.576	When we're out on the road,
590.576	other people have expectations:
593.369	So, when a cyclist puts up their arm,
595.149	it means they're expecting the car
595.149	to yield to them and make room for them
598.667	to make a lane change.
601.03	And when a police officer
601.03	stood in the road,
603.203	our vehicle should understand
603.203	that this means stop,
605.943	and when they signal to go,
605.943	we should continue.
609.449	Now, the way we accomplish this
609.449	is by sharing data between the vehicles.
613.21	The first, most crude model of this
614.906	is when one vehicle
614.906	sees a construction zone,
617.019	having another know about it
617.019	so it can be in the correct lane
620.081	to avoid some of the difficulty.
621.651	But we actually have a much
621.651	deeper understanding of this.
624.315	We could take all of the data
624.315	that the cars have seen over time,
627.324	the hundreds of thousands
627.324	of pedestrians, cyclists,
629.7	and vehicles that have been out there
631.487	and understand what they look like
633.182	and use that to infer
633.182	what other vehicles should look like
636.013	and other pedestrians should look like.
637.939	And then, even more importantly,
637.939	we could take from that a model
640.96	of how we expect them
640.96	to move through the world.
643.29	So here the yellow box is a pedestrian
643.29	crossing in front of us.
646.253	Here the blue box is a cyclist
646.253	and we anticipate
648.503	that they're going to nudge out
648.503	and around the car to the right.
652.115	Here there's a cyclist
652.115	coming down the road
654.207	and we know they're going to continue
654.207	to drive down the shape of the road.
657.693	Here somebody makes a right turn,
659.56	and in a moment here, somebody's
659.56	going to make a U-turn in front of us,
662.92	and we can anticipate that behavior
662.92	and respond safely.
665.534	Now, that's all well and good
665.534	for things that we've seen,
668.262	but of course, you encounter
668.262	lots of things that you haven't
671.127	seen in the world before.
672.358	And so just a couple of months ago,
674.099	our vehicles were driving
674.099	through Mountain View,
676.334	and this is what we encountered.
677.978	This is a woman in an electric wheelchair
680.06	chasing a duck in circles on the road.
680.06	(Laughter)
682.677	Now it turns out, there is nowhere
682.677	in the DMV handbook
685.788	that tells you how to deal with that,
688.033	but our vehicles were able
688.033	to encounter that,
690.176	slow down, and drive safely.
692.431	Now, we don't have to deal
692.431	with just ducks.
694.472	Watch this bird fly across in front of us.
694.472	The car reacts to that.
698.18	Here we're dealing with a cyclist
699.795	that you would never expect to see
699.795	anywhere other than Mountain View.
703.085	And of course, we have
703.085	to deal with drivers,
705.153	even the very small ones.
708.868	Watch to the right as someone
708.868	jumps out of this truck at us.
714.46	And now, watch the left as the car
714.46	with the green box decides
717.389	he needs to make a right turn
717.389	at the last possible moment.
720.714	Here, as we make a lane change,
720.714	the car to our left decides
723.565	it wants to as well.
727.118	And here, we watch a car
727.118	blow through a red light
729.811	and yield to it.
731.901	And similarly, here, a cyclist
731.901	blowing through that light as well.
735.755	And of course,
735.755	the vehicle responds safely.
738.501	And of course, we have people
738.501	who do I don't know what
741.102	sometimes on the road, like this guy
741.102	pulling out between two self-driving cars.
744.925	"You have to ask, ""What are you thinking?"""
746.97	(Laughter)
748.182	Now, I just fire-hosed you
748.182	with a lot of stuff there,
750.703	so I'm going to break one of these
750.703	down pretty quickly.
753.353	So what we're looking at is the scene
753.353	with the cyclist again,
756.293	and you might notice in the bottom,
756.293	we can't actually see the cyclist yet,
759.784	but the car can: it's that little
759.784	blue box up there,
762.288	and that comes from the laser data.
764.369	And that's not actually
764.369	really easy to understand,
766.787	so what I'm going to do is I'm going
766.787	to turn that laser data and look at it,
770.371	and if you're really good at looking
770.371	at laser data, you can see
773.4	a few dots on the curve there,
774.887	right there, and that blue box
774.887	is that cyclist.
777.259	Now as our light is red,
778.408	the cyclist's light
778.408	has turned yellow already,
780.6	and if you squint, you can see that
780.6	in the imagery.
783.038	But the cyclist, we see, is going
783.038	to proceed through the intersection.
786.324	Our light has now turned green,
786.324	his is solidly red,
788.718	and we now anticipate that this bike
788.718	is going to come all the way across.
793.01	Unfortunately the other drivers next to us
793.01	were not paying as much attention.
796.752	They started to pull forward,
796.752	and fortunately for everyone,
799.909	this cyclists reacts, avoids,
802.92	and makes it through the intersection.
805.111	And off we go.
806.679	Now, as you can see, we've made
806.679	some pretty exciting progress,
809.627	and at this point we're pretty convinced
811.529	this technology is going
811.529	to come to market.
813.539	We do three million miles of testing
813.539	in our simulators every single day,
818.322	so you can imagine the experience
818.322	that our vehicles have.
821.011	We are looking forward to having
821.011	this technology on the road,
823.875	and we think the right path
823.875	is to go through the self-driving
826.765	rather than driver assistance approach
828.609	because the urgency is so large.
831.23	In the time I have given this talk today,
836.758	How soon can we bring it out?
839.126	Well, it's hard to say because
839.126	it's a really complicated problem,
842.958	but these are my two boys.
845.172	My oldest son is 11, and that means
845.172	in four and a half years,
848.795	he's going to be able
848.795	to get his driver's license.
851.372	My team and I are committed
851.372	to making sure that doesn't happen.
854.576	Thank you.
856.48	(Laughter) (Applause)
861.11	Chris Anderson: Chris,
861.11	I've got a question for you.
863.678	Chris Urmson: Sure.
866.487	CA: So certainly, the mind of your cars
866.487	is pretty mind-boggling.
870.411	On this debate between
870.411	driver-assisted and fully driverless --
874.87	I mean, there's a real debate
874.87	going on out there right now.
877.911	So some of the companies,
877.911	for example, Tesla,
880.744	are going the driver-assisted route.
882.903	What you're saying is that
882.903	that's kind of going to be a dead end
888.151	because you can't just keep improving
888.151	that route and get to fully driverless
893.607	at some point, and then a driver
893.607	"is going to say, ""This feels safe,"""
897.137	and climb into the back,
897.137	and something ugly will happen.
899.784	CU: Right. No, that's exactly right,
899.784	and it's not to say
902.46	that the driver assistance systems
902.46	aren't going to be incredibly valuable.
905.997	They can save a lot of lives
905.997	in the interim,
908.055	but to see the transformative opportunity
908.055	to help someone like Steve get around,
911.888	to really get to the end case in safety,
913.857	to have the opportunity
913.857	to change our cities
916.336	and move parking out and get rid of
916.336	these urban craters we call parking lots,
920.54	it's the only way to go.
921.78	CA: We will be tracking your progress
921.78	with huge interest.
924.498	Thanks so much, Chris.
924.498	CU: Thank you. (Applause)
