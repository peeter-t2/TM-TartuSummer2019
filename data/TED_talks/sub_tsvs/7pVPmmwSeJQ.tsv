12.498	Five years ago, I was a Ph.D. student
15.097	living two lives.
16.741	In one, I used NASA supercomputers
19.057	to design next-generation spacecraft,
21.785	and in the other I was a data scientist
24.364	looking for potential smugglers
26.783	of sensitive nuclear technologies.
30.022	As a data scientist, I did a lot of analyses,
32.881	mostly of facilities,
34.348	industrial facilities around the world.
36.619	And I was always looking for a better canvas
39.307	to tie these all together.
41.373	And one day, I was thinking about how
43.239	all data has a location,
45.363	and I realized that the answer
47.096	had been staring me in the face.
48.984	Although I was a satellite engineer,
51.622	I hadn't thought about using satellite imagery
54.793	in my work.
56.359	Now, like most of us, I'd been online,
58.306	I'd see my house, so I thought,
60.088	I'll hop in there and I'll start looking up
62.386	some of these facilities.
63.803	And what I found really surprised me.
65.772	The pictures that I was finding
67.446	were years out of date,
69.347	and because of that,
70.415	it had relatively little relevance
72.086	to the work that I was doing today.
74.546	But I was intrigued.
76.007	I mean, satellite imagery is pretty amazing stuff.
79.243	There are millions and millions of sensors
81.546	surrounding us today,
82.99	but there's still so much we
82.99	don't know on a daily basis.
85.95	How much oil is stored in all of China?
89.703	How much corn is being produced?
92.636	How many ships are in all of our world's ports?
96.707	Now, in theory, all of these questions
99.266	could be answered by imagery,
101.51	but not if it's old.
103.237	And if this data was so valuable,
105.695	then how come I couldn't get my hands
107.627	on more recent pictures?
110.177	So the story begins over 50 years ago
113.312	with the launch of the first generation
115.183	of U.S. government photo reconnaissance satellites.
118.783	And today, there's a handful
120.479	of the great, great grandchildren
122.674	of these early Cold War machines
124.339	which are now operated by private companies
126.348	and from which the vast majority of satellite imagery
129.057	that you and I see on a daily basis comes.
131.882	During this period, launching things into space,
134.796	just the rocket to get the satellite up there,
137.473	has cost hundreds of millions of dollars each,
142.074	and that's created tremendous pressure
143.826	to launch things infrequently
146.115	and to make sure that when you do,
147.459	you cram as much functionality in there as possible.
151.098	All of this has only made satellites
152.709	bigger and bigger and bigger
155.126	and more expensive,
156.724	now nearly a billion, with a b, dollars per copy.
161.761	Because they are so expensive,
163.46	there aren't very many of them.
164.927	Because there aren't very many of them,
166.272	the pictures that we see on a daily basis
168.728	tend to be old.
170.232	I think a lot of people actually
170.232	understand this anecdotally,
173.514	but in order to visualize just how sparsely
176.053	our planet is collected,
177.937	some friends and I put together a dataset
180.003	of the 30 million pictures that have been gathered
182.59	by these satellites between 2000 and 2010.
186.074	As you can see in blue, huge areas of our world
188.829	are barely seen, less than once a year,
191.619	and even the areas that are seen most frequently,
193.891	those in red, are seen at best once a quarter.
197.639	Now as aerospace engineering grad students,
200.555	this chart cried out to us as a challenge.
203.983	Why do these things have to be so expensive?
207.438	Does a single satellite really have to cost
210.173	the equivalent of three 747 jumbo jets?
214.936	Wasn't there a way to build a smaller,
217.099	simpler, new satellite design that could enable
220.271	more timely imaging?
222.289	I realize that it does sound a little bit crazy
225.74	that we were going to go out and just
227.251	begin designing satellites,
229.098	but fortunately we had help.
231.061	In the late 1990s, a couple of professors
233.996	proposed a concept for radically reducing the price
237.477	of putting things in space.
239.249	This was hitchhiking small satellites
241.36	alongside much larger satellites.
244.376	This dropped the cost of putting objects up there
247.285	by over a factor of 100,
249.283	and suddenly we could afford to experiment,
252.369	to take a little bit of risk,
253.837	and to realize a lot of innovation.
256.103	And a new generation of engineers and scientists,
259.192	mostly out of universities,
260.791	began launching these very small,
263.134	breadbox-sized satellites called CubeSats.
265.725	And these were built with electronics obtained
268.128	from RadioShack instead of Lockheed Martin.
272.026	Now it was using the lessons
272.026	learned from these early missions
274.866	that my friends and I began a series of sketches
277.561	of our own satellite design.
279.25	And I can't remember a specific day
282.034	where we made a conscious decision
283.894	that we were actually going to
283.894	go out and build these things,
286.529	but once we got that idea in our minds
288.959	of the world as a dataset,
291.12	of being able to capture millions of data points
293.61	on a daily basis describing the global economy,
296.663	of being able to unearth billions of connections
299.183	between them that had never before been found,
302.348	it just seemed boring
303.996	to go work on anything else.
306.903	And so we moved into a cramped,
309.876	windowless office in Palo Alto,
312.855	and began working to take our design
314.822	from the drawing board into the lab.
317.76	The first major question we had to tackle
320.418	was just how big to build this thing.
322.752	In space, size drives cost,
325.935	and we had worked with these very small,
327.948	breadbox-sized satellites in school,
330.042	but as we began to better
330.042	understand the laws of physics,
332.593	we found that the quality of pictures
334.715	those satellites could take was very limited,
337.799	because the laws of physics dictate
339.503	that the best picture you
339.503	can take through a telescope
342.609	is a function of the diameter of that telescope,
344.848	and these satellites had a very small,
346.51	very constrained volume.
348.216	And we found that the best picture we would
350.011	have been able to get looked something like this.
352.496	Although this was the low-cost option,
354.741	quite frankly it was just too blurry
356.414	to see the things that make
356.414	satellite imagery valuable.
359.983	So about three or four weeks later,
362.129	we met a group of engineers randomly
364.946	who had worked on the first
366.587	private imaging satellite ever developed,
369.028	and they told us that back in the 1970s,
371.146	the U.S. government had found a powerful
373.328	optimal tradeoff --
374.971	that in taking pictures at right
374.971	about one meter resolution,
378.059	being able to see objects one meter in size,
380.943	they had found that they could not
380.943	just get very high-quality images,
383.634	but get a lot of them at an affordable price.
386.527	From our own computer simulations,
388.503	we quickly found that one meter really was
390.508	the minimum viable product
392.272	to be able to see the drivers of our global economy,
395.351	for the first time, being able to count
396.912	the ships and cars and shipping
396.912	containers and trucks
399.633	that move around our world on a daily basis,
402.457	while conveniently still not
402.457	being able to see individuals.
406.261	We had found our compromise.
407.882	We would have to build something larger
409.486	than the original breadbox,
411.049	now more like a mini-fridge,
412.7	but we still wouldn't have to build a pickup truck.
415.461	So now we had our constraint.
418.085	The laws of physics dictated
419.842	the absolute minimum-sized
419.842	telescope that we could build.
423.166	What came next was making the rest of the satellite
426.22	as small and as simple as possible,
427.961	basically a flying telescope with four walls
430.613	and a set of electronics smaller than a phone book
433.554	that used less power than a 100 watt lightbulb.
436.992	The big challenge became actually taking
438.892	the pictures through that telescope.
441.09	Traditional imaging satellites use a line scanner,
444.134	similar to a Xerox machine,
445.895	and as they traverse the Earth, they take pictures,
448.295	scanning row by row by row
450.491	to build the complete image.
452.166	Now people use these because they get a lot of light,
455.17	which means less of the noise you see
457.016	in a low-cost cell phone image.
459.752	The problem with them is they require
462.113	very sophisticated pointing.
464.353	You have to stay focused on a 50-centimeter target
466.899	from over 600 miles away
468.651	while moving at more than
468.651	seven kilometers a second,
470.883	which requires an awesome degree of complexity.
473.632	So instead, we turned to a new
473.632	generation of video sensors,
477.069	originally created for use in night vision goggles.
480.16	Instead of taking a single, high quality image,
483.059	we could take a videostream
484.446	of individually noisier frames,
487.369	but then we could recombine
489.113	all of those frames together
490.579	into very high-quality images
492.575	using sophisticated pixel processing techniques
495.168	here on the ground,
496.689	at a cost of one one hundredth a traditional system.
499.826	And we applied this technique
500.979	to many of the other systems on the satellite as well,
503.953	and day by day, our design evolved
506.793	from CAD to prototypes
510.282	to production units.
513.17	A few short weeks ago,
514.827	we packed up SkySat 1,
516.678	put our signatures on it,
518.451	and waved goodbye for the last time on Earth.
520.674	Today, it's sitting in its final launch configuration
524.155	ready to blast off in a few short weeks.
527.216	And soon, we'll turn our attention to launching
529.558	a constellation of 24 or more of these satellites
532.589	and beginning to build the scalable analytics
535.139	that will allow us to unearth the insights
537.478	in the petabytes of data we will collect.
540.667	So why do all of this? Why build these satellites?
544.64	Well, it turns out imaging satellites
547.251	have a unique ability to provide global transparency,
550.961	and providing that transparency on a timely basis
553.587	is simply an idea whose time has come.
556.998	We see ourselves as pioneers of a new frontier,
560.521	and beyond economic data,
562.285	unlocking the human story, moment by moment.
565.886	For a data scientist
567.449	that just happened to go to space camp as a kid,
570.199	it just doesn't get much better than that.
572.914	Thank you.
575.129	(Applause)
