27	Thank you. It's really an honor and a privilege to be here
31	spending my last day as a teenager.
33	Today I want to talk to you about the future, but
37	first I'm going to tell you a bit about the past.
40	My story starts way before I was born.
44	My grandmother was on a train to Auschwitz, the death camp.
48	And she was going along the tracks, and the tracks split.
53	And somehow -- we don't really know exactly the whole story -- but
58	the train took the wrong track and went to a work camp rather than the death camp.
63	My grandmother survived and married my grandfather.
68	They were living in Hungary, and my mother was born.
71	And when my mother was two years old,
73	the Hungarian revolution was raging, and they decided to escape Hungary.
78	They got on a boat, and yet another divergence --
82	the boat was either going to Canada or to Australia.
85	They got on and didn't know where they were going, and ended up in Canada.
89	So, to make a long story short, they came to Canada.
92	My grandmother was a chemist. She worked at the Banting Institute in Toronto,
96	and at 44 she died of stomach cancer. I never met my grandmother,
104	but I carry on her name -- her exact name, Eva Vertes --
108	and I like to think I carry on her scientific passion, too.
112	I found this passion not far from here, actually, when I was nine years old.
118	My family was on a road trip and we were in the Grand Canyon.
123	And I had never been a reader when I was young --
126	my dad had tried me with the Hardy Boys; I tried Nancy Drew;
129	I tried all that -- and I just didn't like reading books.
133	And my mother bought this book when we were at the Grand Canyon
137	"called ""The Hot Zone."" It was all about the outbreak of the Ebola virus."
140	And something about it just kind of drew me towards it.
143	There was this big sort of bumpy-looking virus on the cover,
146	and I just wanted to read it. I picked up that book,
150	and as we drove from the edge of the Grand Canyon
153	to Big Sur, and to, actually, here where we are today, in Monterey,
156	I read that book, and from when I was reading that book,
161	I knew that I wanted to have a life in medicine.
164	I wanted to be like the explorers I'd read about in the book,
167	who went into the jungles of Africa,
169	went into the research labs and just tried to figure out
171	what this deadly virus was. So from that moment on, I read every medical book
177	I could get my hands on, and I just loved it so much.
181	I was a passive observer of the medical world.
185	It wasn't until I entered high school that I thought,
189	"""Maybe now, you know -- being a big high school kid --"
192	"I can maybe become an active part of this big medical world."""
197	I was 14, and I emailed professors at the local university
202	to see if maybe I could go work in their lab. And hardly anyone responded.
207	But I mean, why would they respond to a 14-year-old, anyway?
211	And I got to go talk to one professor, Dr. Jacobs,
215	who accepted me into the lab.
218	At that time, I was really interested in neuroscience
221	and wanted to do a research project in neurology --
224	specifically looking at the effects of heavy metals on the developing nervous system.
229	So I started that, and worked in his lab for a year,
234	and found the results that I guess you'd expect to find
238	when you feed fruit flies heavy metals -- that it really, really impaired the nervous system.
243	The spinal cord had breaks. The neurons were crossing in every which way.
247	And from then I wanted to look not at impairment, but at prevention of impairment.
252	So that's what led me to Alzheimer's. I started reading about Alzheimer's
258	and tried to familiarize myself with the research,
261	and at the same time when I was in the --
263	I was reading in the medical library one day, and I read this article
266	"about something called ""purine derivatives."""
268	And they seemed to have cell growth-promoting properties.
273	And being naive about the whole field, I kind of thought,
276	"""Oh, you have cell death in Alzheimer's"
278	which is causing the memory deficit, and then you have this compound --
283	"purine derivatives -- that are promoting cell growth."""
285	"And so I thought, ""Maybe if it can promote cell growth,"
288	"it can inhibit cell death, too."""
290	And so that's the project that I pursued for that year,
293	and it's continuing now as well,
296	"and found that a specific purine derivative called ""guanidine"""
301	had inhibited the cell growth by approximately 60 percent.
304	So I presented those results at the International Science Fair,
308	which was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life.
312	"And there I was awarded ""Best in the World in Medicine,"""
315	which allowed me to get in, or at least get a foot in the door of the big medical world.
322	And from then on, since I was now in this huge exciting world,
328	I wanted to explore it all. I wanted it all at once, but knew I couldn't really get that.
333	"And I stumbled across something called ""cancer stem cells."""
335	And this is really what I want to talk to you about today -- about cancer.
339	At first when I heard of cancer stem cells,
343	I didn't really know how to put the two together. I'd heard of stem cells,
347	and I'd heard of them as the panacea of the future --
350	the therapy of many diseases to come in the future, perhaps.
353	But I'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time,
357	so how did the good and bad go together?
361	Last summer I worked at Stanford University, doing some research on cancer stem cells.
367	And while I was doing this, I was reading the cancer literature,
370	trying to -- again -- familiarize myself with this new medical field.
375	And it seemed that tumors actually begin from a stem cell.
383	This fascinated me. The more I read, the more I looked at cancer differently
390	and almost became less fearful of it.
393	It seems that cancer is a direct result to injury.
398	If you smoke, you damage your lung tissue, and then lung cancer arises.
403	If you drink, you damage your liver, and then liver cancer occurs.
408	And it was really interesting -- there were articles correlating
411	if you have a bone fracture, and then bone cancer arises.
414	Because what stem cells are -- they're these
418	phenomenal cells that really have the ability to differentiate
422	into any type of tissue.
424	So, if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ
429	and then it's initiating cancer, it's almost as if this is a repair response.
434	And the cancer, the body is saying the lung tissue is damaged,
439	we need to repair the lung. And cancer is originating in the lung
443	trying to repair -- because you have this excessive proliferation
447	of these remarkable cells that really have the potential to become lung tissue.
452	But it's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response,
456	but can't quite control it.
458	It hasn't yet become fine-tuned enough to finish what has been initiated.
463	So this really, really fascinated me.
466	And I really think that we can't think about cancer --
471	let alone any disease -- in such black-and-white terms.
474	If we eliminate cancer the way we're trying to do now, with chemotherapy and radiation,
480	we're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins, or with radiation, trying to kill it.
485	It's almost as if we're getting back to this starting point.
488	We're removing the cancer cells, but we're revealing the previous damage
493	that the body has tried to fix.
495	Shouldn't we think about manipulation, rather than elimination?
500	If somehow we can cause these cells to differentiate --
504	to become bone tissue, lung tissue, liver tissue,
507	whatever that cancer has been put there to do --
510	it would be a repair process. We'd end up better than we were before cancer.
519	So, this really changed my view of looking at cancer.
523	And while I was reading all these articles about cancer,
528	it seemed that the articles -- a lot of them -- focused on, you know,
530	the genetics of breast cancer, and the genesis
532	and the progression of breast cancer --
534	tracking the cancer through the body, tracing where it is, where it goes.
540	But it struck me that I'd never heard of cancer of the heart,
545	or cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter.
548	And skeletal muscle constitutes 50 percent of our body,
552	or over 50 percent of our body. And so at first I kind of thought,
557	"""Well, maybe there's some obvious explanation"
559	"why skeletal muscle doesn't get cancer -- at least not that I know of."""
563	So, I looked further into it, found as many articles as I could,
568	and it was amazing -- because it turned out that it was very rare.
572	Some articles even went as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue
576	is resistant to cancer, and furthermore, not only to cancer,
581	but of metastases going to skeletal muscle.
585	And what metastases are is when the tumor --
588	when a piece -- breaks off and travels through the blood stream
591	and goes to a different organ. That's what a metastasis is.
595	It's the part of cancer that is the most dangerous.
598	If cancer was localized, we could likely remove it,
601	or somehow -- you know, it's contained. It's very contained.
605	But once it starts moving throughout the body, that's when it becomes deadly.
608	So the fact that not only did cancer not seem to originate in skeletal muscles,
613	but cancer didn't seem to go to skeletal muscle --
616	there seemed to be something here.
618	"So these articles were saying, you know, ""Skeletal --"
620	"metastasis to skeletal muscle -- is very rare."""
623	But it was left at that. No one seemed to be asking why.
627	So I decided to ask why. At first -- the first thing I did
634	was I emailed some professors who
636	specialized in skeletal muscle physiology, and pretty much said,
639	"""Hey, it seems like cancer doesn't really go to skeletal muscle."
645	"Is there a reason for this?"" And a lot of the replies I got were that"
649	muscle is terminally differentiated tissue.
653	Meaning that you have muscle cells, but they're not dividing,
656	so it doesn't seem like a good target for cancer to hijack.
660	But then again, this fact that the metastases
663	didn't go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely.
667	And furthermore, that nervous tissue -- brain -- gets cancer,
672	and brain cells are also terminally differentiated.
675	So I decided to ask why. And here's some of, I guess, my hypotheses
681	that I'll be starting to investigate this May at the Sylvester Cancer Institute in Miami.
690	And I guess I'll keep investigating until I get the answers.
695	But I know that in science, once you get the answers,
698	inevitably you're going to have more questions.
700	So I guess you could say that I'll probably be doing this for the rest of my life.
705	Some of my hypotheses are that
708	when you first think about skeletal muscle,
711	there's a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle.
714	And the first thing that makes me think is that
718	blood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells.
721	Tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels.
723	And you think, the more highways there are in a tissue,
727	the more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases.
731	"So first of all I thought, you know, ""Wouldn't it be favorable"
734	"to cancer getting to skeletal muscle?"" And as well,"
737	cancer tumors require a process called angiogenesis,
742	which is really, the tumor recruits the blood vessels to itself
746	to supply itself with nutrients so it can grow.
749	Without angiogenesis, the tumor remains the size of a pinpoint and it's not harmful.
756	So angiogenesis is really a central process to the pathogenesis of cancer.
762	And one article that really stood out to me
765	when I was just reading about this, trying to figure out why cancer doesn't go to skeletal
769	muscle, was that it had reported 16 percent of micro-metastases
776	to skeletal muscle upon autopsy.
783	but only .16 percent of actual metastases --
788	suggesting that maybe skeletal muscle is able to control the angiogenesis,
794	is able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels.
799	We use skeletal muscles so much. It's the one portion of our body --
804	our heart's always beating. We're always moving our muscles.
807	Is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows
811	that it needs this blood supply? It needs to be constantly contracting,
815	so therefore it's almost selfish. It's grabbing its blood vessels for itself.
818	Therefore, when a tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue,
822	it can't get a blood supply, and can't grow.
825	So this suggests that maybe if there is an anti-angiogenic factor
830	in skeletal muscle -- or perhaps even more,
832	an angiogenic routing factor, so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow --
837	this could be a potential future therapy for cancer.
841	And another thing that's really interesting is that
846	there's this whole -- the way tumors move throughout the body,
850	it's a very complex system -- and there's something called the chemokine network.
854	And chemokines are essentially chemical attractants,
858	and they're the stop and go signals for cancer.
861	So a tumor expresses chemokine receptors,
866	and another organ -- a distant organ somewhere in the body --
869	will have the corresponding chemokines,
871	and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it.
875	Is it possible that skeletal muscle doesn't express this type of molecules?
880	And the other really interesting thing is that
883	when skeletal muscle -- there's been several reports that when skeletal
887	muscle is injured, that's what correlates with metastases going to skeletal muscle.
894	And, furthermore, when skeletal muscle is injured,
897	that's what causes chemokines -- these signals saying,
901	"""Cancer, you can come to me,"" the ""go signs"" for the tumors --"
905	it causes them to highly express these chemokines.
909	So, there's so much interplay here.
916	I mean, there are so many possibilities
918	for why tumors don't go to skeletal muscle.
921	But it seems like by investigating, by attacking cancer,
925	by searching where cancer is not, there has got to be something --
929	there's got to be something -- that's making this tissue resistant to tumors.
935	And can we utilize -- can we take this property,
938	this compound, this receptor, whatever it is that's controlling these
942	anti-tumor properties and apply it to cancer therapy in general?
949	Now, one thing that kind of ties the resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer --
957	to the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body --
962	"is that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called ""MyoD."""
970	And what MyoD essentially does is, it causes cells to differentiate
975	into muscle cells. So this compound, MyoD,
980	has been tested on a lot of different cell types and been shown to
984	actually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells.
988	So, is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue,
994	but once in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue,
998	MyoD acts upon these tumor cells and causes them
1003	to become skeletal muscle cells?
1006	Maybe tumor cells are being disguised as skeletal muscle cells,
1009	and this is why it seems as if it is so rare.
1014	It's not harmful; it has just repaired the muscle.
1017	Muscle is constantly being used -- constantly being damaged.
1020	If every time we tore a muscle
1023	or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way,
1026	cancer occurred -- I mean, everybody would have cancer almost.
1033	And I hate to say that. But it seems as though muscle cell,
1037	possibly because of all its use, has adapted
1040	faster than other body tissues to respond to injury,
1043	to fine-tune this repair response and actually be able to finish the process
1049	which the body wants to finish. I really believe that the human body is very,
1054	very smart, and we can't counteract something the body is saying to do.
1060	It's different when a bacteria comes into the body --
1063	that's a foreign object -- we want that out.
1067	But when the body is actually initiating a process
1069	and we're calling it a disease, it doesn't seem as though elimination is
1073	the right solution. So even to go from there, it's possible, although far-fetched,
1081	that in the future we could almost think of cancer being used as a therapy.
1088	If those diseases where tissues are deteriorating --
1091	for example Alzheimer's, where the brain, the brain cells, die
1096	and we need to restore new brain cells, new functional brain cells --
1100	what if we could, in the future, use cancer? A tumor --
1104	put it in the brain and cause it to differentiate into brain cells?
1109	That's a very far-fetched idea, but I really believe that it may be possible.
1115	These cells are so versatile, these cancer cells are so versatile --
1119	we just have to manipulate them in the right way.
1122	And again, some of these may be far-fetched, but
1126	I figured if there's anywhere to present far-fetched ideas, it's here at TED, so
1131	thank you very much.
1133	(Applause)
