15.695	All right. So, like all good stories,
17.678	this starts a long, long time ago
19.612	when there was basically nothing.
21.761	So here is a complete picture of the universe
24.161	about 14-odd billion years ago.
27.613	All energy is concentrated into a single point of energy.
30.697	For some reason it explodes,
32.281	and you begin to get these things.
34.397	So you're now about 14 billion years into this.
37.263	And these things expand and expand and expand
39.159	into these giant galaxies,
40.858	and you get trillions of them.
42.177	And within these galaxies
44.325	you get these enormous dust clouds.
46.444	And I want you to pay particular attention
48.209	to the three little prongs
49.659	in the center of this picture.
51.56	If you take a close-up of those,
52.975	they look like this.
54.628	And what you're looking at is columns of dust
57.478	where there's so much dust --
59.525	by the way, the scale of this is a trillion vertical miles --
63.858	and what's happening is there's so much dust,
66.776	it comes together and it fuses
68.71	and ignites a thermonuclear reaction.
72.169	And so what you're watching
73.011	is the birth of stars.
74.996	These are stars being born out of here.
76.653	When enough stars come out,
79.121	they create a galaxy.
80.919	This one happens to be a particularly important galaxy,
84.353	because you are here.
86.569	(Laughter)
87.736	And as you take a close-up of this galaxy,
89.387	you find a relatively normal,
91.452	not particularly interesting star.
93.82	By the way, you're now about two-thirds of the way into this story.
97.835	So this star doesn't even appear
100.017	until about two-thirds of the way into this story.
102.968	And then what happens
104.046	is there's enough dust left over
105.452	that it doesn't ignite into a star,
107.418	it becomes a planet.
109.418	And this is about a little over four billion years ago.
114.243	And soon thereafter
115.676	there's enough material left over
117.593	that you get a primordial soup,
122.156	and that creates life.
123.92	And life starts to expand and expand and expand,
127.801	until it goes kaput.
129.552	(Laughter)
133.04	Now the really strange thing
134.47	is life goes kaput, not once, not twice,
137.376	but five times.
139.592	So almost all life on Earth
141.694	is wiped out about five times.
144.158	And as you're thinking about that,
145.71	what happens is you get more and more complexity,
148.142	more and more stuff
149.376	to build new things with.
153.494	And we don't appear
154.764	until about 99.96 percent of the time into this story,
160.412	just to put ourselves and our ancestors in perspective.
164.342	So within that context, there's two theories of the case
167.801	as to why we're all here.
169.49	The first theory of the case
171.079	is that's all she wrote.
174.488	Under that theory,
175.847	we are the be-all and end-all
177.683	of all creation.
179.416	And the reason for trillions of galaxies,
182.3	sextillions of planets,
184.313	is to create something that looks like that
189.023	and something that looks like that.
192.656	And that's the purpose of the universe;
194.197	and then it flat-lines,
195.481	it doesn't get any better.
196.792	(Laughter)
201.272	The only question you might want to ask yourself is,
204.091	could that be just mildly arrogant?
209.326	And if it is --
211.067	and particularly given the fact that we came very close to extinction.
216.449	There were only about 2,000 of our species left.
219.816	A few more weeks without rain,
221.899	we would have never seen any of these.
224.983	(Laughter)
231.682	(Applause)
236.316	So maybe you have to think about a second theory
239.282	if the first one isn't good enough.
242.199	Second theory is: Could we upgrade?
243.983	(Laughter)
246.882	Well, why would one ask a question like that?
250.116	Because there have been at least 29 upgrades so far
252.581	of humanoids.
254.617	So it turns out that we have upgraded.
257.467	We've upgraded time and again and again.
259.382	And it turns out that we keep discovering upgrades.
262.298	We found this one last year.
264.482	We found another one last month.
267.099	And as you're thinking about this,
269.298	you might also ask the question:
271.401	So why a single human species?
274.498	Wouldn't it be really odd
276.332	if you went to Africa and Asia and Antarctica
280.116	and found exactly the same bird --
282.735	particularly given that we co-existed at the same time
286.527	with at least eight other versions of humanoid
289.313	at the same time on this planet?
291.781	So the normal state of affairs
293.66	is not to have just a Homo sapiens;
296.17	the normal state of affairs
297.191	is to have various versions of humans walking around.
301.02	And if that is the normal state of affairs,
303.837	then you might ask yourself,
306.205	all right, so if we want to create something else,
308.27	how big does a mutation have to be?
311.138	Well Svante Paabo has the answer.
313.77	The difference between humans and Neanderthal
316.57	is 0.004 percent of gene code.
319.869	That's how big the difference is
321.569	one species to another.
323.786	This explains most contemporary political debates.
328.186	(Laughter)
330.121	But as you're thinking about this,
333.332	one of the interesting things
334.69	is how small these mutations are and where they take place.
338.087	Difference human/Neanderthal
339.42	is sperm and testis,
341.153	smell and skin.
342.521	And those are the specific genes
344.007	that differ from one to the other.
346.687	So very small changes can have a big impact.
349.788	And as you're thinking about this,
351.42	we're continuing to mutate.
353.936	So about 10,000 years ago by the Black Sea,
356.837	we had one mutation in one gene
358.897	which led to blue eyes.
361.453	And this is continuing and continuing and continuing.
365.337	And as it continues,
366.771	one of the things that's going to happen this year
368.536	is we're going to discover the first 10,000 human genomes,
371.869	because it's gotten cheap enough to do the gene sequencing.
375.138	And when we find these,
376.726	we may find differences.
379.22	And by the way, this is not a debate that we're ready for,
382.296	because we have really misused the science in this.
385.672	In the 1920s, we thought there were major differences between people.
389.355	That was partly based on Francis Galton's work.
393.153	He was Darwin's cousin.
395.289	But the U.S., the Carnegie Institute,
397.604	Stanford, American Neurological Association
400.186	took this really far.
402.054	That got exported and was really misused.
405.653	In fact, it led to some absolutely horrendous
408.338	treatment of human beings.
410.351	So since the 1940s, we've been saying there are no differences,
412.945	we're all identical.
414.265	We're going to know at year end if that is true.
417.542	And as we think about that,
419.274	we're actually beginning to find things
420.792	like, do you have an ACE gene?
424.258	Why would that matter?
426.236	Because nobody's ever climbed an 8,000-meter peak without oxygen
430.274	that doesn't have an ACE gene.
433.024	And if you want to get more specific,
434.893	how about a 577R genotype?
437.908	Well it turns out that every male Olympic power athelete ever tested
442.608	carries at least one of these variants.
445.858	If that is true,
447.512	it leads to some very complicated questions
449.67	for the London Olympics.
451.471	Three options:
452.99	Do you want the Olympics to be a showcase
455.822	for really hardworking mutants?
458.522	(Laughter)
460.255	Option number two:
462.99	Why don't we play it like golf or sailing?
466.388	Because you have one and you don't have one,
468.862	I'll give you a tenth of a second head start.
472.857	Version number three:
473.928	Because this is a naturally occurring gene
475.997	and you've got it and you didn't pick the right parents,
478.779	you get the right to upgrade.
482.728	Three different options.
484.479	If these differences are the difference
486.101	between an Olympic medal and a non-Olympic medal.
489.479	And it turns out that as we discover these things,
492.313	we human beings really like to change
495.648	how we look, how we act,
497.342	what our bodies do.
498.936	And we had about 10.2 million plastic surgeries in the United States,
503.31	except that with the technologies that are coming online today,
506.627	today's corrections, deletions,
509.328	augmentations and enhancements
511.247	are going to seem like child's play.
514.16	You already saw the work by Tony Atala on TED,
517.861	but this ability to start filling
521.428	things like inkjet cartridges with cells
524.361	are allowing us to print skin, organs
529.035	and a whole series of other body parts.
531.785	And as these technologies go forward,
533.669	you keep seeing this, you keep seeing this, you keep seeing things --
540.227	and it seems like nothing's happening,
544.009	until it does.
547.121	And we may just be in some of these weeks.
550.645	And as you're thinking about
552.244	these two guys sequencing a human genome in 2000
555.695	and the Public Project sequencing the human genome in 2000,
559.248	then you don't hear a lot,
562.412	until you hear about an experiment last year in China,
566.396	where they take skin cells from this mouse,
570.413	put four chemicals on it,
572.146	turn those skin cells into stem cells,
575.712	let the stem cells grow
577.177	and create a full copy of that mouse.
580.264	That's a big deal.
583.511	Because in essence
584.527	what it means is you can take a cell,
586.675	which is a pluripotent stem cell,
588.961	which is like a skier at the top of a mountain,
591.645	and those two skiers become two pluripotent stem cells,
595.462	four, eight, 16,
597.244	and then it gets so crowded
598.912	after 16 divisions
600.712	that those cells have to differentiate.
603.214	So they go down one side of the mountain,
604.647	they go down another.
605.88	And as they pick that,
607.414	these become bone,
609.664	and then they pick another road and these become platelets,
612.596	and these become macrophages,
614.713	and these become T cells.
615.98	But it's really hard, once you ski down,
617.932	to get back up.
619.455	Unless, of course, if you have a ski lift.
624.867	And what those four chemicals do
627.316	is they take any cell
629.385	and take it way back up the mountain
631.317	so it can become any body part.
633.35	And as you think of that,
635.078	what it means is potentially
637.058	you can rebuild a full copy
639.233	of any organism
641.1	out of any one of its cells.
643.686	That turns out to be a big deal
646.217	because now you can take, not just mouse cells,
648.783	but you can human skin cells
651.101	and turn them into human stem cells.
654.751	And then what they did in October
657.949	is they took skin cells, turned them into stem cells
661.349	and began to turn them into liver cells.
665.022	So in theory,
666.066	you could grow any organ from any one of your cells.
671.25	Here's a second experiment:
672.968	If you could photocopy your body,
676.101	maybe you also want to take your mind.
679.153	And one of the things you saw at TED
680.718	about a year and a half ago
681.968	was this guy.
683.403	And he gave a wonderful technical talk.
686.003	He's a professor at MIT.
687.602	But in essence what he said
689.518	is you can take retroviruses,
691.218	which get inside brain cells of mice.
694.018	You can tag them with proteins
696.458	that light up when you light them.
698.552	And you can map the exact pathways
702.268	when a mouse sees, feels, touches,
705.751	remembers, loves.
707.934	And then you can take a fiber optic cable
710.307	and light up some of the same things.
714.126	And by the way, as you do this,
715.958	you can image it in two colors,
717.975	which means you can download this information
720.374	as binary code directly into a computer.
725.114	So what's the bottom line on that?
727.587	Well it's not completely inconceivable
729.787	that someday you'll be able to download your own memories,
734.282	maybe into a new body.
736.669	And maybe you can upload other people's memories as well.
741.754	And this might have just one or two
744.268	small ethical, political, moral implications.
747.788	(Laughter)
749.319	Just a thought.
752.31	Here's the kind of questions
753.838	that are becoming interesting questions
755.818	for philosophers, for governing people,
758.302	for economists, for scientists.
761.668	Because these technologies are moving really quickly.
764.952	And as you think about it,
766.452	let me close with an example of the brain.
769.534	The first place where you would expect
771.217	to see enormous evolutionary pressure today,
774.268	both because of the inputs,
776.533	which are becoming massive,
778.085	and because of the plasticity of the organ,
779.867	is the brain.
782.401	Do we have any evidence that that is happening?
785.719	Well let's take a look at something like autism incidence per thousand.
790.45	Here's what it looks like in 2000.
792.952	Here's what it looks like in 2002,
799.652	Here's the increase in less than a decade.
803.734	And we still don't know why this is happening.
808.151	What we do know is, potentially,
810.636	the brain is reacting in
812.668	a hyperactive, hyper-plastic way,
814.802	and creating individuals that are like this.
817.752	And this is only one of the conditions that's out there.
820.509	You've also got people with who are extraordinarily smart,
824.049	people who can remember everything they've seen in their lives,
826.446	people who've got synesthesia,
827.831	people who've got schizophrenia.
829.162	You've got all kinds of stuff going on out there,
831.696	and we still don't understand
832.914	how and why this is happening.
835.147	But one question you might want to ask is,
837.829	are we seeing a rapid evolution of the brain
840.457	and of how we process data?
842.282	Because when you think of how much data's coming into our brains,
845.345	we're trying to take in as much data in a day
848.829	as people used to take in in a lifetime.
851.38	And as you're thinking about this,
854.012	there's four theories as to why this might be going on,
856.354	plus a whole series of others.
857.681	I don't have a good answer.
859.33	There really needs to be more research on this.
862.946	One option is the fast food fetish.
865.181	There's beginning to be some evidence
867.63	that obesity and diet
869.881	have something to do
871.512	with gene modifications,
873.28	which may or may not have an impact
875.63	on how the brain of an infant works.
879.147	A second option is the sexy geek option.
883.102	These conditions are highly rare.
887.345	(Laughter)
890.383	(Applause)
895.683	But what's beginning to happen
897.316	is because these geeks are all getting together,
899.85	because they are highly qualified for computer programming
902.747	and it is highly remunerated,
905.065	as well as other very detail-oriented tasks,
908.215	that they are concentrating geographically
910.664	and finding like-minded mates.
913.631	So this is the assortative mating hypothesis
917.199	of these genes reinforcing one another
919.899	in these structures.
922.016	The third, is this too much information?
924.966	We're trying to process so much stuff
926.463	that some people get synesthetic
928.815	and just have huge pipes that remember everything.
931.415	Other people get hyper-sensitive to the amount of information.
934.084	Other people react with various psychological conditions
938.066	or reactions to this information.
939.698	Or maybe it's chemicals.
942.4	But when you see an increase
944.165	of that order of magnitude in a condition,
946.516	either you're not measuring it right
948.081	or there's something going on very quickly,
950.599	and it may be evolution in real time.
954.631	Here's the bottom line.
957.134	What I think we are doing
959.315	is we're transitioning as a species.
961.031	And I didn't think this when Steve Gullans and I started writing together.
966.515	I think we're transitioning into Homo evolutis
968.966	that, for better or worse,
970.365	is not just a hominid that's conscious of his or her environment,
974.547	it's a hominid that's beginning to directly and deliberately
977.766	control the evolution of its own species,
980.964	of bacteria, of plants, of animals.
984.798	And I think that's such an order of magnitude change
987.633	that your grandkids or your great-grandkids
990.736	may be a species very different from you.
993.781	Thank you very much.
995.367	(Applause)
