12.644	OK, so, confession:
14.502	I've always been weirdly
14.502	obsessed with advertising.
20.238	I remember watching
20.238	Saturday morning cartoons,
23.33	paying more attention to the commercials
25.487	than to the shows,
26.818	trying to figure out how they were trying
26.818	to get inside my head.
29.932	Ultimately, that led me to my dream job.
32.035	I became a partner
32.035	at a big New York ad agency.
35.337	But then, all of that suddenly changed
35.337	on February 23, 1997,
41.55	when my little brother Matt
41.55	was shot in the head
44.922	in a shooting that happened
44.922	on the observation deck
47.771	of the Empire State Building.
49.911	Suddenly, my family was thrown
49.911	into the middle of a nightmare,
55.097	being told that my brother
55.097	was going to die,
59.251	actually being given the opportunity
59.251	to say goodbye to him,
62.951	then several emergency brain surgeries
65.325	and now what's amounted, for Matt,
68	to a lifetime spent courageously
68	recovering from a traumatic brain injury.
74.27	He is definitely my hero.
77.101	But as much as (Applause) --
77.101	yeah, deserves it --
79.467	(Applause)
84.597	But as much as this tragedy
84.597	was a nightmare for my family,
90.224	I often think about how much worse
90.224	it could have been;
92.799	in fact, how much worse
92.799	it is for the 90 families every day
97.882	who aren't as fortunate,
99.786	who lose loved ones -- brothers,
99.786	sisters, sons, daughters, parents.
106.018	They don't all make national headlines.
108.543	In fact, most of them don't.
110.209	They go largely unnoticed,
112.305	in a nation that's kind of come to accept
112.305	a disgraceful national epidemic
118.928	as some kind of new normal.
122.8	So I quit my job in advertising
125.17	to try and do something about
125.17	this disgraceful national epidemic,
130.296	because I came to realize
131.517	that the challenges
131.517	to preventing gun violence
134.654	are actually the same ones
134.654	that made me love advertising,
138.343	which is to try to figure out
138.343	how to engage people.
140.85	Only instead of doing it to sell products,
143.477	doing it to save lives.
145.726	And that comes down to
145.726	finding common ground,
150.673	where what I want overlaps
150.673	with what you want.
154.706	And you might be surprised to learn,
154.706	when it comes to gun violence,
157.936	just how much common ground there is.
160.007	Let's look, for example,
160.007	at people who love to hunt,
163.016	a sport enjoyed by millions across the US.
166.222	It's a proud tradition. Families.
168.886	In some places,
170.064	the first day of hunting season
170.064	is actually a school holiday.
173.821	What do hunters want?
175.285	Well, they want to hunt.
175.285	They love their guns.
177.657	They believe deeply
178.881	in the Second Amendment right
178.881	to own those guns.
181.397	But that doesn't mean
181.397	there isn't common ground.
183.7	In fact, there's a lot of it,
185.152	starting with the basic idea
185.152	of keeping guns out of dangerous hands.
190.58	This isn't about taking
190.58	certain guns away from all people.
195.418	It's about keeping all guns
195.418	away from certain people,
198.318	and it's the people that, it turns out,
198.318	we all agree shouldn't have guns:
201.807	convicted violent criminals,
201.807	domestic abusers,
204.311	the dangerously mentally ill.
207.205	We can all appreciate
208.38	how Brady background checks
208.38	have been incredibly effective
211.311	in keeping guns
211.311	out of those dangerous hands.
213.603	In 20 years, Brady background checks
213.603	at federally licensed firearm dealers
218.034	have blocked 2.4 million gun sales
221.823	to those people that we all agree
221.823	shouldn't have guns.
225.463	(Applause)
229.41	And whether you love guns or hate guns,
229.41	you probably also appreciate
233.631	that there shouldn't be thousands
233.631	of gun sales every day
236.831	at guns shows or online
238.701	without those Brady background checks,
240.584	just like there shouldn't be two lines
240.584	to get on an airplane --
243.608	one with security
243.608	and one with no security.
246.256	And --
247.431	(Applause)
250.957	And the numbers show the overwhelming
250.957	agreement among the American public:
	expanding Brady background checks
259.051	to all gun sales -- including
261.709	more than 80 percent of gun owners,
263.653	more than 70 percent of NRA members.
265.929	This is not a controversial idea.
267.867	In fact, only six percent
267.867	of the American public disagrees.
271.467	That's about the percentage
271.467	of the American public
273.856	that believes the moon landing was a fake.
276.069	(Laughter)
277.458	And it's also about the percentage
277.458	that believes the government
280.454	is putting mind-controlling technology
280.454	in our TV broadcast signals.
284.437	That's the extent to which we agree
284.437	about background checks.
287.288	But what about the 300 million guns
290.86	already out there in homes across America?
293.28	Well first, it's important to realize
295.074	that those guns are mostly
295.074	in the hands and homes
299.436	of decent, law-abiding people
299.436	like you and me,
302.4	who want what we all want --
302.4	including keeping our families safe.
306.695	In fact, that's why more and more people
306.695	are choosing to own guns.
310.704	Ten years ago, 42 percent
310.704	of the American public
315.063	believed -- incorrectly -- that a gun
315.063	makes your home safer.
319.364	Today, that number is 63 percent.
323.784	Why?
324.96	I kind of hate to say it,
326.182	because it gets to the dark
326.182	underbelly of advertising,
328.796	which is if you tell
328.796	a big enough lie enough times,
331.248	eventually that lie becomes the truth.
333.113	And that's exactly what's happened here.
335.084	The corporate gun lobby
335.084	has spent billions of dollars
337.65	blocking the CDC from doing research
337.65	into the public health epidemic
340.999	of gun violence;
342.684	blocking pediatricians
342.684	from talking to parents
344.868	about the dangers of guns in the home;
346.703	blocking smart-gun technology
346.703	and other technology
349.096	that would prevent kids
349.096	from firing parents' guns
351.791	and would save lives.
353.812	They're desperate to hide the truth,
356.105	because they view the truth
356.105	as a threat to their bottom line.
360.407	And every day,
361.592	people are dying as a result.
363.211	And a lot of those people are children.
366.108	Every day in the US,
368.469	nine kids are just shot unintentionally.
	take their own lives every year.
377.476	And here's the thing:
377.476	they're almost all with a parent's gun.
381.874	Even two-thirds of school shootings
381.874	happen with a gun taken from the home,
388.259	including the terrible tragedy
389.968	at Sandy Hook.
391.562	I meet so many of these parents;
393.549	it's the most heartbreaking
393.549	part of my job.
396.379	These are not bad people.
399.476	They're just living with the unimaginable
399.476	consequences of a very bad decision,
404.715	made based on very bad information
407.61	that was put into their minds
407.61	by very bad people,
410.522	who know good and well
410.522	the misery that they're causing,
413.751	but just don't care.
416.577	And the result is a nightmare --
419.063	not only for families like mine,
421.657	but for, really, at the end
421.657	of the day, all of us.
425.472	But I'm not here to talk
425.472	about the nightmare of gun violence.
428.41	I'm here to talk about our dream,
428.41	and it's a dream we all share,
431.47	which is the dream
431.47	of a better, safer, future.
433.97	For my organization,
433.97	for the Brady Campaign,
436.696	that dream is reflected in the bold goal
439.308	to cut the number of gun deaths
439.308	in the US in half by 2025.
444.102	And I hope to leave
444.102	all of you here tonight
446.628	with a strong sense of exactly why
446.628	that dream is so absolutely within reach.
452.525	Because folks,
453.915	for every great movement around the world,
456.751	there's a moment
456.751	where you can look back and say,
459.562	"""That's when things"
459.562	"really started to change."""
463.065	And I'm here to say
464.313	that for the movement
464.313	to end gun violence in America,
467.258	that moment is here.
470.308	(Applause)
475.993	We are so clearly at a tipping point,
478.898	because the American public
478.898	has come together by the millions
482.033	like never before,
482.033	based on that common ground,
484.271	"to say, ""Enough."""
485.69	Enough of the mass shootings
485.69	in malls and movie theaters
488.921	and churches and schools.
490.851	Enough of the daily terror
490.851	of gun violence in homes and streets
495.768	that's claimed the lives of women
495.768	and young black men
498.999	in staggering proportions.
500.445	Enough of easy access to guns
502.252	by the people that we all agree
502.252	shouldn't have them.
504.752	And enough of a small group
504.752	of craven politicians
507.811	putting the interests
507.811	of the corporate gun lobby
510.124	ahead of the people
510.124	they have been elected to represent.
513.147	Enough.
514.322	(Applause)
520.5	And the really exciting thing is,
520.5	it's not just the usual suspects like me
524.428	that are saying it anymore.
525.984	It's so much bigger than that.
527.912	And if you want proof,
529.087	let's start where most conversations
529.087	in the US seem to start --
532.663	with Kim Kardashian.
534.091	(Laughter)
535.305	And here's the thing:
535.305	it's not really a joke.
537.448	I mean, think about when issues change.
539.345	It's when they go from being
539.345	political and advocacy issues
542.138	to being part of pop culture,
543.568	voices coming from everywhere,
543.568	celebrities using their platforms,
547.161	musicians, athletes.
548.786	The NBA has come forward.
550.066	Conservative pundits that you never
550.066	would have imagined
552.744	have come forward.
553.919	There's real cultural change --
555.485	I even hear there's a TED Talk
555.485	about it this year.
557.875	That's the extent to which
557.875	this cultural change is happening.
562.444	And yes, Kim Kardashian has made
562.444	an unsolicited passionate appeal
566.396	to her 35 million Twitter followers
569.534	for expanded background checks.
571.906	Let's look at the political elections
571.906	that are heating up.
574.845	This used to be the classic
574.845	third-rail issue for Democrats.
577.726	Couldn't run from it fast enough.
579.464	Now candidates are running on it.
581.171	Some are being forced
581.171	to reverse very bad positions
584.162	they defended very comfortably,
584.162	until very recently.
588.408	For somebody like me,
590.062	watching people wave around
590.062	their negative NRA ratings --
595.148	it's almost surreal to watch.
598.391	We're still outfunded, yes,
598.391	by the corporate gun lobby,
602.138	and ultimately that needs to change.
604.531	But you know what?
605.716	We're smarter and we're scrappier,
605.716	and we have the truth on our side.
610.099	And we're on offense.
611.843	You know, they say that the Internet
611.843	democratizes information.
615.277	Social media and some
615.277	of the organizing tools that plug into it
619.039	have democratized activism.
620.936	It's allowed us to show what 90 percent
620.936	support really looks like.
624.327	Sometimes I think of it --
625.598	you know, we're converging
625.598	and attacking instantly by the millions,
628.859	kind of like white blood cells.
630.486	It's enabled us to start to really
630.486	close -- and this is the bottom line --
635.069	close that disgraceful disconnect
637.299	between what the American public wants
639.735	and what our elected leaders
639.735	are doing about it.
642.006	Until recently,
643.554	the narrative in Congress
643.554	was that calls from the other side,
646.83	from that six percent,
648.014	outnumbered calls from our side 10 to one.
651.218	We're flipping that narrative on its head.
653.281	After that recent terrible tragedy
653.281	in San Bernardino,
655.915	we jammed Congressional switchboards.
657.744	We put 15,000 calls
657.744	into Congress in 24 hours.
663.141	And you know what?
664.316	We got a vote on a bill
665.491	that nobody thought was going to see
665.491	the light of day anytime soon.
668.729	We're seeing real movement
668.729	to repeal some of the most evil,
671.594	ugly gun lobby legislation
671.594	passed over the last dark decade.
676.257	The stranglehold of the gun lobby
676.257	is clearly being broken.
679.188	We've seen President Obama's
679.188	historic executive actions.
682.514	They don't go all the way,
683.928	but they are going to save lives,
685.539	because they expand
685.539	Brady background checks
687.61	to thousands of gun sales
687.61	that didn't have them previously.
691.206	And we're marching across the country --
691.206	we're not just waiting
694.238	for Congress to act; that would almost
694.238	be the definition of insanity.
697.647	We're marching across the country,
699.316	state by state, marriage-equality style.
701.939	And you know what? We're winning.
703.537	Congress is almost always
703.537	the last to wake up and realize
707.228	that it's on the wrong side of history.
709.441	And when they do, it's always
709.441	because the American public shakes them.
713.086	And that's exactly
713.086	what we're doing right now,
715.292	as we're in this tipping point.
716.854	You know, recently I was flying
716.854	cross-country to give a speech
720.827	to a large group like this,
720.827	although far less intimidating,
724.283	and the woman sitting next to me
724.283	happened to be binge-watching
728.048	one of my all-time favorite
728.048	"TV shows, ""Mad Men,"""
733	a period TV show about advertising
735.238	in the 1960s.
737.08	And as I was trying to think
737.08	about how to end my remarks,
740.701	I'd glance up at her screen
740.701	every now and then,
743	and it seemed that every time I did,
745.317	I'd see somebody smoking
745.317	in an office or around children
749.666	or while pregnant or drinking and driving
752.103	or driving without seat belts
752.103	or sexually harassing a coworker.
756.098	And ultimately it dawned on me:
758.496	what tremendous inspiration
759.882	to those of us who have this dream
759.882	to end gun violence.
763.865	I mean, think about how much
763.865	the world has changed
766.46	in a relatively short period of time,
769.263	how all those behaviors that were once
769.263	considered commonplace or normal --
772.92	some even glamorous or sexy --
775.161	have become stigmatized
775.161	in just a generation or two,
779.292	once they became conversations
779.292	about our common ground.
783.799	That is the magnitude of the change
783.799	we have the potential to create
788.637	around gun violence.
790.296	And that's my dream,
791.884	that maybe someday,
793.376	some period TV show will depict
793.376	the terrible nightmare of gun violence,
798.895	and a future generation of children
798.895	might only be able to imagine
802.293	how terrible it must have been.
804.166	Thank you.
805.341	(Applause)
811.079	Thank you.
812.254	(Applause)
813.771	Thank you.
814.946	(Applause)
