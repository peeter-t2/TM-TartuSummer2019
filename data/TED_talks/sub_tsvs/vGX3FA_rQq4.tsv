12.685	Back home, my friends call me nicknames,
15.755	"such as ""The Giant Clam Girl,"""
18.012	"""Clam Queen,"""
19.319	"or, ""The Mother of Clams."""
21.579	(Laughter)
22.954	This is because every time I see them,
25.233	I talk nonstop about giant clams all day,
28.518	every day.
30.774	Giant clams are these massive
30.774	and colorful shelled marine animals,
34.62	the largest of its kind.
36.777	Just look at this shell.
40.142	The biggest recorded individual
40.142	was four-and-a-half-feet long
43.337	and weighed about 550 pounds.
45.735	That is almost as heavy
45.735	as three baby elephants.
50.266	South Pacific legends once described
50.266	giant clams as man-eaters
54.707	that would lie in wait on the seabed
54.707	to trap unsuspecting divers.
59.191	A story goes that a diver
59.191	had lost his legs
62.413	while trying to retrieve a pearl
62.413	from a giant clam.
65.895	"I thought, ""Really?"""
68.258	So out of curiosity,
69.946	I did an experiment using myself as bait.
73.013	(Laughter)
74.929	I carefully placed my hand
74.929	into the clam's mouth and waited.
79.064	Hmm ...
80.355	I still have my hand.
82.731	It seems that these gentle giants
82.731	would rather retreat
85.475	and protect their fleshy bodies
87.08	than feed on me.
88.315	So much for those killer clam myths!
91.778	Unfortunately, the reality is,
94.494	we are the giant clams' biggest threat.
97.855	Considered a delicacy throughout
97.855	the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans,
102.065	giant clams have been traditionally
102.065	fished as seafood.
105.614	Fishermen are particularly interested
105.614	in their adductor muscles,
109.178	which are organs that hold
109.178	the two shells together like a hinge.
113.536	Just for their muscles,
114.972	giant clams were almost
114.972	hunted to extinction
117.335	between the 1960s and 1980s.
121.037	Clamshells are also popular
121.037	in the ornamental trade
124.581	as jewelry and for display.
127.115	In the South China Sea,
128.881	fishermen went out of their way
128.881	to collect fossilized clamshells
132.807	by digging through large areas
132.807	of coral reefs.
135.811	These were later carved and sold
135.811	"as so-called ""ivory handicrafts"" in China."
141.757	Giant clams, dead or alive,
141.757	are not safe from us.
145.445	"It's a ""clamity!"""
147.245	(Laughter)
152.518	(Applause)
157.593	With the spotlight on more
157.593	charismatic marine animals
161.243	such as the whales and coral reefs,
163.433	it is easy to forget that other
163.433	marine life needs our help, too.
167.552	My fascination with giant clams
167.552	got me started on conservation research
172.495	to fill in the knowledge gaps
172.495	on their ecology and behavior.
176.292	One of the discoveries that we made
176.292	was that giant clams could walk
179.708	across the seafloor.
182.172	Yes, you heard me right:
183.718	they can walk.
185.355	To find out,
186.572	we placed numerous baby clams on a grid.
188.829	Now watch what happens over 24 hours.
196.892	We think that walking is important
196.892	for getting away from predators
200.678	and finding mates for breeding.
202.69	While it can hard to imagine
202.69	any movement in these enormous animals,
206.767	giant clams up to 400 pounds
206.767	can still walk,
210.275	they just move slower.
213.348	During my PhD, I discovered
213.348	more secrets about the giant clams.
217.759	But there was something
217.759	missing in my work.
221.823	I found myself asking,
223.796	"""Why should people care"
223.796	"about conserving giant clams?"" --"
227.279	other than myself, of course.
230.753	(Laughter)
235.713	It turns out that giant clams
235.713	have a giant impact on coral reefs.
240.314	These multitasking clams
240.314	are reef builders,
243.697	food factories,
245.496	shelters for shrimps and crabs
247.867	and water filters,
249.093	all rolled into one.
250.966	In a nutshell,
252.387	giant clams play a major contributing role
254.78	as residents of their own reef home,
257.131	and just having them around
257.131	keeps the reef healthy.
261	And because they can live
261	up to 100 years old,
264.135	giant clams make vital indicators
264.135	of coral reef health.
268.087	So when giant clams
268.087	start to disappear from coral reefs,
271.777	their absence can serve as an alarm bell
273.798	for scientists to start paying attention,
276.106	similar to the canary in a coal mine.
278.958	But giant clams are endangered.
281.675	The largest clam in the world
281.675	is facing the threat of extinction,
285.185	with more than 50 percent
285.185	of the wild population severely depleted.
290.423	And the ecological benefits
290.423	of having giant clams on coral reefs
294.251	are likely to continue
294.251	only if populations are healthy,
298.786	making their conservation paramount.
301.79	So I stand here today to give a voice
301.79	to the giant clams,
305.441	because I care a whole lot
305.441	for these amazing animals,
308.472	and they deserve to be cared for.
311.423	It is time for the giant clams
311.423	to step out of their shells,
315.003	and show the world that they, too,
315.003	can be the heroes of the oceans.
319.174	Thank you very much.
320.413	(Applause)
