12.875	Design is a slippery
12.875	and elusive phenomenon,
15.921	which has meant different
15.921	things at different times.
19.206	But all truly inspiring design projects
19.206	have one thing in common:
23.498	they began with a dream.
25.679	And the bolder the dream,
27.141	the greater the design feat
27.141	that will be required to achieve it.
30.806	And this is why the greatest
30.806	designers are almost always
34.724	the biggest dreamers
34.724	and rebels and renegades.
38.787	This has been the case throughout history,
41.594	all the way back to the year 300 BC,
45.539	when a 13-year-old became the king
48.682	of a remote, very poor
48.682	and very small Asian country.
53.475	He dreamt of acquiring land,
53.475	riches and power
56.984	through military conquest.
58.675	And his design skills --
60.082	improbable though it sounds --
61.929	would be essential
61.929	in enabling him to do so.
65.605	At the time,
66.779	all weapons were made by hand
66.779	to different specifications.
70.213	So if an archer ran out
70.213	of arrows during a battle,
73.543	they wouldn't necessarily be able
73.543	to fire another archer's arrows
77.49	from their bow.
79.362	This of course meant that they would
79.362	be less effective in combat
82.947	and very vulnerable, too.
85.339	Ying solved this problem
86.965	by insisting that all bows and arrows
86.965	were designed identically,
91.08	so they were interchangeable.
92.835	And he did the same for daggers,
92.835	axes, spears, shields
96.861	and every other form of weaponry.
100.002	His formidably equipped army
100.002	won batter after battle,
103.932	and within 15 years,
105.746	his tiny kingdom had
105.746	succeeded in conquering
108.928	all its larger, richer,
108.928	more powerful neighbors,
111.777	to found the mighty Chinese Empire.
115.041	Now, no one, of course,
116.594	would have thought of describing
116.594	Ying Zheng as a designer at the time --
120.396	why would they?
121.628	And yet he used design
121.628	unknowingly and instinctively
125.455	but with tremendous ingenuity
127.439	to achieve his ends.
129.631	And so did another equally
129.631	improbable, accidental designer,
134.195	who was also not above using
134.195	violence to get what he wanted.
138.376	This was Edward Teach, better known
138.376	as the British pirate, Blackbeard.
144.012	This was the golden age of piracy,
146.301	where pirates like Teach
146.301	were terrorizing the high seas.
149.998	Colonial trade was flourishing,
151.991	and piracy was highly profitable.
154.276	And the smarter pirates like him
154.276	realized that to maximize their spoils,
159.139	they needed to attack
159.139	their enemies so brutally
163.79	that they would surrender on sight.
165.607	So in other words,
166.782	they could take the ships
166.782	without wasting ammunition,
169.352	or incurring casualties.
171.417	So Edward Teach redesigned
171.417	himself as Blackbeard
175.106	by playing the part of a merciless brute.
177.794	He wore heavy jackets and big hats
177.794	to accentuate his height.
181.843	He grew the bushy black beard
181.843	that obscured his face.
185.362	He slung braces of pistols
185.362	on either shoulder.
188.933	He even attached matches to the brim
188.933	of his hat and set them alight,
192.855	so they sizzled menacingly
192.855	whenever his ship was poised to attack.
197.009	And like many pirates of that era,
199.605	he flew a flag that bore
199.605	the macabre symbols
202.518	of a human skull
202.518	and a pair of crossed bones,
206.002	because those motifs had signified death
206.002	in so many cultures for centuries,
211.717	that their meaning
211.717	was instantly recognizable,
214.603	even in the lawless, illiterate
214.603	world of the high seas:
218.167	surrender or you'll suffer.
220.667	So of course, all his sensible
220.667	victims surrendered on sight.
224.646	Put like that,
226	it's easy to see why Edward Teach
226	and his fellow pirates
230.699	could be seen as pioneers
230.699	of modern communications design,
235.198	and why their deadly symbol --
237.146	(Laughter)
238.232	there's more --
239.407	why their deadly symbol
239.407	of the skull and crossbones
242.416	was a precursor of today's logos,
244.73	rather like the big red letters
244.73	standing behind me,
248.101	but of course with a different message.
250.304	(Laughter)
251.332	Yet design was also used to nobler ends
254.366	by an equally brilliant and equally
254.366	improbable designer,
258.604	the 19th-century British nurse,
258.604	Florence Nightingale.
262.464	Her mission was to provide
262.464	decent healthcare for everyone.
267.367	Nightingale was born into a rather
267.367	grand, very wealthy British family,
271.807	who were horrified when she volunteered
271.807	to work in military hospitals
275.872	during the Crimean War.
277.963	Once there, she swiftly realized
280.316	that more patients were dying
280.316	of infections that they caught there,
283.953	in the filthy, fetid wards,
285.945	than they were of battle wounds.
287.722	So she campaigned
287.722	for cleaner, lighter, airier clinics
292.032	to be designed and built.
294.389	Back in Britain,
295.598	she mounted another campaign,
297.112	this time for civilian hospitals,
299.194	and insisted that the same design
299.194	principles were applied to them.
303.496	The Nightingale ward, as it is called,
306.272	dominated hospital design
306.272	for decades to come,
309.976	and elements of it are still used today.
313.834	But by then,
315.113	design was seen as a tool
315.113	of the Industrial Age.
318.165	It was formalized and professionalized,
320.915	but it was restricted to specific roles
323.432	and generally applied in pursuit
323.432	of commercial goals
326.534	rather than being used intuitively,
328.833	as Florence Nightingale, Blackbeard
328.833	and Ying Zheng had done.
333.412	By the 20th century,
334.906	this commercial ethos was so powerful,
337.943	that any designers who deviated from it
340.491	risked being seen as cranks
340.491	or subversives.
344.538	Now among them is one
344.538	of my great design heroes,
348.378	the brilliant László Moholy-Nagy.
350.93	He was the Hungarian artist and designer
353.721	whose experiments with the impact
353.721	of technology on daily life
358.001	were so powerful
359.191	that they still influence
359.191	the design of the digital images
362.515	we see on our phone and computer screens.
365.658	He radicalized the Bauhaus Design
365.658	School in 1920s Germany,
370.379	and yet some of his former
370.379	colleagues shunned him
373.15	when he struggled to open a new
373.15	Bauhaus in Chicago years later.
378.194	Moholy's ideas were as bold
378.194	and incisive as ever,
382.432	but his approach to design
382.432	was too experimental,
386.183	as was his insistence
386.183	on seeing it, as he put it,
389.691	as an attitude, not a profession
389.691	to be in tune with the times.
394.782	And sadly, the same applied
396.659	to another design maverick:
396.659	Richard Buckminster Fuller.
401.167	He was yet another
401.167	brilliant design visionary
404.881	and design activist,
406.322	who was completely committed
406.322	to designing a sustainable society
410.91	in such a forward-thinking way
412.814	that he started talking about
412.814	the importance of environmentalism
416.178	in design in the 1920s.
419.632	Now he, despite his efforts,
422.109	was routinely mocked as a crank
422.109	by many in the design establishment,
426.866	and admittedly,
428.058	some of his experiments failed,
429.875	like the flying car
429.875	that never got off the ground.
432.893	And yet, the geodesic dome,
434.965	his design formula to build
434.965	an emergency shelter
438.313	from scraps of wood, metal, plastic,
441.018	bits of tree, old blankets,
441.018	plastic sheeting --
444.288	just about anything
444.288	that's available at the time --
447.059	is one of the greatest feats
447.059	of humanitarian design,
450.654	and has provided sorely needed refuge
453.341	to many, many people
453.341	in desperate circumstances
456.588	ever since.
458.446	Now, it was the courage
458.446	and verve of radical designers
462.508	like Bucky and Moholy
464.384	that drew me to design.
466.681	I began my career as a news journalist
466.681	and foreign correspondent.
470.741	I wrote about politics, economics
470.741	and corporate affairs,
474.183	and I could have chosen
474.183	to specialize in any of those fields.
478.033	But I picked design,
479.801	because I believe it's one of the most
479.801	powerful tools at our disposal
483.533	to improve our quality of life.
487.755	Thank you, fellow TED design buffs.
490.357	(Applause)
492.045	And greatly as I admire the achievements
492.045	of professional designers,
496.477	which have been extraordinary and immense,
499.096	I also believe
500.581	that design benefits hugely
500.581	from the originality,
504.098	the lateral thinking
505.44	and the resourcefulness
505.44	of its rebels and renegades.
509.683	And we're living at a remarkable
509.683	moment in design,
513.653	because this is a time when the two camps
513.653	are coming closer together.
518.481	Because even very basic advances
518.481	in digital technology
522.796	have enabled them to operate
522.796	increasingly independently,
527.104	in or out of a commercial context,
529.542	to pursue ever more ambitious
529.542	and eclectic objectives.
534.615	So in theory,
536.285	basic platforms like crowdfunding,
536.285	cloud computing, social media
541.596	are giving greater freedom
541.596	to professional designers
545.064	and giving more resources
545.064	for the improvisational ones,
548.573	and hopefully,
549.754	a more receptive response to their ideas.
552.671	Now, some of my favorite
552.671	examples of this are in Africa,
556.862	where a new generation of designers
559.013	are developing incredible
559.013	Internet of Things technologies
562.582	to fulfill Florence Nightingale's dream
562.582	of improving healthcare
567.21	in countries where more people
567.21	now have access to cell phones
570.782	than to clean, running water.
572.991	And among them is Arthur Zang.
575.642	He's a young, Cameroonian design engineer
578.536	who has a adapted a tablet
578.536	computer into the Cardiopad,
582.705	a mobile heart-monitoring device.
585.152	It can be used to monitor the hearts
585.152	of patients in remote, rural areas.
589.517	The data is then sent
589.517	on a cellular network
592.187	to well-equipped hospitals
592.187	hundreds of miles away
595.241	for analysis.
596.441	And if any problems are spotted
596.441	by the specialists there,
599.77	a suitable course of treatment
599.77	is recommended.
603.018	And this of course saves many patients
605.353	from making long, arduous, expensive
605.353	and often pointless journeys
610.582	to those hospitals,
611.924	and makes it much, much likelier
614.227	that their hearts
614.227	will actually be checked.
617.298	Arthur Zang started working
617.298	on the Cardiopad eight years ago,
620.644	in his final year at university.
623.391	But he failed to persuade
623.391	any conventional sources
626.83	to give him investment to get
626.83	the project off the ground.
630.281	He posted the idea on Facebook,
632.178	where a Cameroonian
632.178	government official saw it
634.858	and managed to secure
634.858	a government grant for him.
638.119	He's now developing
638.119	not only the Cardiopad,
641.179	but other mobile medical devices
641.179	to treat different conditions.
645.831	And he isn't alone,
647.501	because there are many other
647.501	inspiring and enterprising designers
652.448	who are also pursuing
652.448	extraordinary projects of their own.
656.364	And I'm going to finish
656.364	by looking at just a few of them.
659.934	One is Peek Vision.
662.213	This is a group of doctors
662.213	and designers in Kenya,
665.312	who've developed an Internet of Things
665.312	technology of their own,
668.545	as a portable eye examination kit.
671.639	Then there's Gabriel Maher,
673.585	who is developing a new design language
675.683	to enable us to articulate the subtleties
675.683	of our changing gender identities,
680.827	without recourse
680.827	to traditional stereotypes.
683.736	All of these designers and many more
683.736	are pursuing their dreams,
688.027	by the making the most
688.027	of their newfound freedom,
690.677	with the discipline
690.677	of professional designers
693.599	and the resourcefulness
693.599	of rebels and renegades.
696.525	And we all stand to benefit.
698.611	Thank you.
699.798	(Applause)
