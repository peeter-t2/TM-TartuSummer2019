13.317	How do you find a dinosaur?
15.928	Sounds impossible, doesn't it?
18.65	It's not.
19.969	And the answer relies on a formula
19.969	that all paleontologists use.
24.722	And I'm going to tell you the secret.
27.35	First, find rocks of the right age.
31.226	Second, those rocks
31.226	must be sedimentary rocks.
35.863	And third, layers of those rocks
35.863	must be naturally exposed.
40.768	That's it.
41.943	Find those three things
41.943	and get yourself on the ground,
45.378	chances are good
45.378	that you will find fossils.
48.313	Now let me break down this formula.
50.812	Organisms exist only during certain
50.812	geological intervals.
55.207	So you have to find
55.207	rocks of the right age,
57.661	depending on what your interests are.
59.853	If you want to find trilobites,
61.387	you have to find the really,
61.387	really old rocks of the Paleozoic --
64.562	rocks between a half a billion
64.562	and a quarter-billion years old.
68.306	Now, if you want to find dinosaurs,
70.418	don't look in the Paleozoic,
70.418	you won't find them.
72.799	They hadn't evolved yet.
74.304	You have to find the younger
74.304	rocks of the Mesozoic,
77.415	and in the case of dinosaurs,
78.836	between 235 and 66 million years ago.
83.495	Now, it's fairly easy to find rocks
83.495	of the right age at this point,
86.694	because the Earth is, to a coarse degree,
89.85	geologically mapped.
91.578	This is hard-won information.
94.323	The annals of Earth history
94.323	are written in rocks,
97.151	one chapter upon the next,
98.476	such that the oldest pages are on bottom
101.104	and the youngest on top.
103.583	Now, were it quite that easy,
103.583	geologists would rejoice.
107.66	It's not.
108.942	The library of Earth is an old one.
111.02	It has no librarian to impose order.
114.111	Operating over vast swaths of time,
117.265	myriad geological processes
117.265	offer every possible insult
122.136	to the rocks of ages.
124.277	Most pages are destroyed
124.277	soon after being written.
127.41	Some pages are overwritten,
129.186	creating difficult-to-decipher palimpsests
129.186	of long-gone landscapes.
134.384	Pages that do find sanctuary
134.384	under the advancing sands of time
139.173	are never truly safe.
141.41	Unlike the Moon --
141.41	our dead, rocky companion --
144.778	the Earth is alive, pulsing
144.778	with creative and destructive forces
148.442	that power its geological metabolism.
151.864	Lunar rocks brought back
151.864	by the Apollo astronauts
154.261	all date back to about the age
154.261	of the Solar System.
157.609	Moon rocks are forever.
160.96	Earth rocks, on the other hand,
160.96	face the perils of a living lithosphere.
165.11	All will suffer ruination,
166.718	through some combination
166.718	of mutilation, compression,
169.568	folding, tearing, scorching and baking.
173.14	Thus, the volumes of Earth history
173.14	are incomplete and disheveled.
179.079	The library is vast and magnificent --
183.964	but decrepit.
186.273	And it was this tattered complexity
186.273	in the rock record
189.163	that obscured its meaning
189.163	until relatively recently.
193.031	Nature provided no card catalog
193.031	for geologists --
195.381	this would have to be invented.
198.079	Five thousand years after the Sumerians
198.079	learned to record their thoughts
201.734	on clay tablets,
202.91	the Earth's volumes remained
202.91	inscrutable to humans.
206.495	We were geologically illiterate,
209.637	unaware of the antiquity
209.637	of our own planet
212.843	and ignorant of our connection
214.376	to deep time.
217.04	It wasn't until the turn
217.04	of the 19th century
220.24	that our blinders were removed,
222.66	first, with the publication
222.66	"of James Hutton's ""Theory of the Earth,"""
227.078	in which he told us that the Earth
227.078	reveals no vestige of a beginning
230.974	and no prospect of an end;
233.545	and then, with the printing
233.545	of William Smith's map of Britain,
237.515	the first country-scale geological map,
239.724	giving us for the first time
241.114	predictive insight into where
241.114	certain types of rocks might occur.
245.504	After that, you could say things like,
247.551	"""If we go over there,"
247.551	"we should be in the Jurassic,"""
250.578	"or, ""If we go up over that hill,"
250.578	"we should find the Cretaceous."""
255.129	So now, if you want to find trilobites,
258.008	get yourself a good geological map
260.161	and go to the rocks of the Paleozoic.
263.023	If you want to find dinosaurs like I do,
265.366	find the rocks of Mesozoic and go there.
269.217	Now of course, you can only make
269.217	a fossil in a sedimentary rock,
272.34	a rock made by sand and mud.
274.489	You can't have a fossil
275.68	in an igneous rock formed
275.68	by magma, like a granite,
279.028	or in a metamorphic rock
279.028	that's been heated and squeezed.
282.773	And you have to get yourself in a desert.
285.378	It's not that dinosaurs
285.378	particularly lived in deserts;
288.483	they lived on every land mass
290.071	and in every imaginable environment.
292.596	It's that you need to go to a place
292.596	that's a desert today,
295.565	a place that doesn't have
295.565	too many plants covering up the rocks,
298.763	and a place where erosion is always
298.763	exposing new bones at the surface.
303.302	So find those three things:
304.859	rocks of the right age,
306.438	that are sedimentary rocks, in a desert,
309.511	and get yourself on the ground,
311.092	and you literally walk
312.628	until you see a bone
312.628	sticking out of the rock.
316.562	Here's a picture that I took
316.562	in Southern Patagonia.
320.347	Every pebble that you see
320.347	on the ground there
323.133	is a piece of dinosaur bone.
325.478	So when you're in that right situation,
327.368	it's not a question of whether
327.368	you'll find fossils or not;
330.146	you're going to find fossils.
331.559	The question is: Will you find something
331.559	that is scientifically significant?
335.631	And to help with that, I'm going to add
335.631	a fourth part to our formula,
339.625	which is this:
341.431	get as far away from other
341.431	paleontologists as possible.
344.915	(Laughter)
346.91	It's not that I don't like
346.91	other paleontologists.
349.289	When you go to a place
349.289	that's relatively unexplored,
351.838	you have a much better chance
351.838	of not only finding fossils
354.676	but of finding something
354.676	that's new to science.
357.788	So that's my formula
357.788	for finding dinosaurs,
359.923	and I've applied it all around the world.
361.98	In the austral summer of 2004,
364.332	I went to the bottom of South America,
366.181	to the bottom of Patagonia, Argentina,
368.322	to prospect for dinosaurs:
370.599	a place that had terrestrial
370.599	sedimentary rocks of the right age,
373.996	in a desert,
375.223	a place that had been barely visited
375.223	by paleontologists.
379.166	And we found this.
381.206	This is a femur, a thigh bone,
383.343	of a giant, plant-eating dinosaur.
385.736	That bone is 2.2 meters across.
388.594	That's over seven feet long.
391.807	Now, unfortunately,
391.807	that bone was isolated.
393.931	We dug and dug and dug,
393.931	and there wasn't another bone around.
396.994	But it made us hungry to go back
396.994	the next year for more.
399.713	And on the first day
399.713	of that next field season,
402.34	I found this: another two-meter femur,
405.733	only this time not isolated,
407.4	this time associated with 145 other bones
410.519	of a giant plant eater.
413.064	And after three more hard,
413.064	really brutal field seasons,
417.184	the quarry came to look like this.
419.597	And there you see the tail
419.597	of that great beast wrapping around me.
423.739	The giant that lay in this grave,
423.739	the new species of dinosaur,
427.315	we would eventually call
427.315	"""Dreadnoughtus schrani."""
431.513	Dreadnoughtus was 85 feet
431.513	from snout to tail.
435.03	It stood two-and-a-half stories
435.03	at the shoulder,
438.217	and all fleshed out in life,
438.217	it weighed 65 tons.
443.29	People ask me sometimes,
443.29	"""Was Dreadnoughtus bigger than a T. rex?"""
446.896	That's the mass of eight or nine T. rex.
450.669	Now, one of the really cool things
450.669	about being a paleontologist
453.733	is when you find a new species,
453.733	you get to name it.
456.526	And I've always thought it a shame
456.526	that these giant, plant-eating dinosaurs
460.384	are too often portrayed as passive,
460.384	lumbering platters of meat
464.887	on the landscape.
466.156	(Laughter)
467.585	They're not.
468.908	Big herbivores can be surly,
468.908	and they can be territorial --
471.951	you do not want to mess with a hippo
471.951	or a rhino or a water buffalo.
476.871	The bison in Yellowstone injure
476.871	far more people than do the grizzly bears.
481.846	So can you imagine a big bull,
487.011	in the breeding season,
488.738	defending a territory?
490.99	That animal would have been
490.99	incredibly dangerous,
493.334	a menace to all around, and itself
493.334	would have had nothing to fear.
498.507	"And thus the name, ""Dreadnoughtus,"""
500.756	"or, ""fears nothing."""
504.047	Now, to grow so large,
505.237	an animal like Dreadnoughtus
505.237	would've had to have been
507.873	a model of efficiency.
509.054	That long neck and long tail help it
509.054	radiate heat into the environment,
512.841	passively controlling its temperature.
515.403	And that long neck also serves
515.403	as a super-efficient feeding mechanism.
518.932	Dreadnoughtus could stand
518.932	in one place and with that neck
521.736	clear out a huge envelope of vegetation,
524.052	taking in tens of thousands of calories
524.052	while expending very few.
528.621	And these animals evolved
528.621	a bulldog-like wide-gait stance,
532.945	giving them immense stability,
535.625	because when you're 65 tons,
535.625	when you're literally as big as a house,
539.725	the penalty for falling over
541.856	is death.
543.677	Yeah, these animals are big and tough,
545.606	but they won't take a blow like that.
547.407	Dreadnoughtus falls over,
547.407	ribs break and pierce lungs.
550.012	Organs burst.
551.561	If you're a big 65-ton Dreadnoughtus,
553.371	you don't get to fall down
553.371	in life -- even once.
557.664	Now, after this particular
557.664	Dreadnoughtus carcass was buried
561.254	and de-fleshed by a multitude
561.254	of bacteria, worms and insects,
565.998	its bones underwent a brief metamorphosis,
568.187	exchanging molecules with the groundwater
570.227	and becoming more and more
570.227	like the entombing rock.
573.603	As layer upon layer
573.603	of sediment accumulated,
576.003	pressure from all sides
576.003	weighed in like a stony glove
578.853	whose firm and enduring grip held
578.853	each bone in a stabilizing embrace.
585.654	And then came the long ...
588.044	nothing.
589.868	Epoch after epoch of sameness,
593.21	nonevents without number.
595.501	All the while, the skeleton lay
595.501	everlasting and unchanging
598.947	in perfect equilibrium
601.334	within its rocky grave.
603.995	Meanwhile, Earth history unfolded above.
606.036	The dinosaurs would reign
606.036	for another 12 million years
608.707	before their hegemony was snuffed out
608.707	in a fiery apocalypse.
613.542	The continents drifted. The mammals rose.
616.244	The Ice Age came.
618.623	And then, in East Africa,
620.894	an unpromising species of ape
620.894	evolved the odd trick of sentient thought.
627.752	These brainy primates were not
627.752	particularly fast or strong.
632.062	But they excelled at covering ground,
634.292	and in a remarkable diaspora
636.185	surpassing even the dinosaurs' record
636.185	of territorial conquest,
639.351	they dispersed across the planet,
641.305	ravishing every ecosystem
641.305	they encountered,
644.509	along the way, inventing culture
644.509	and metalworking and painting
647.714	and dance and music
649.786	and science
651.793	and rocket ships that would eventually
651.793	take 12 particularly excellent apes
656.346	to the surface of the Moon.
660.9	With seven billion peripatetic
660.9	Homo sapiens on the planet,
665.253	it was perhaps inevitable
666.494	that one of them would eventually
666.494	trod on the grave of the magnificent titan
670.556	buried beneath the badlands
670.556	of Southern Patagonia.
674.614	I was that ape.
677.038	And standing there, alone in the desert,
680.64	it was not lost on me
681.815	that the chance of any one individual
681.815	entering the fossil record
685.469	is vanishingly small.
688.039	But the Earth is very, very old.
690.111	And over vast tracts of time,
690.111	the improbable becomes the probable.
694.395	That's the magic of the geological record.
697.11	Thus, multitudinous creatures
697.11	living and dying on an old planet
700.316	leave behind immense numbers of fossils,
702.267	each one a small miracle,
704.691	but collectively, inevitable.
708.572	Sixty-six million years ago,
708.572	an asteroid hits the Earth
711.953	and wipes out the dinosaurs.
714.771	This easily might not have been.
717.312	But we only get one history,
717.312	and it's the one that we have.
720.191	But this particular reality
720.191	was not inevitable.
722.491	The tiniest perturbation
722.491	of that asteroid far from Earth
725.317	would have caused it to miss
725.317	our planet by a wide margin.
728.754	The pivotal, calamitous day during which
728.754	the dinosaurs were wiped out,
732.131	setting the stage
732.131	for the modern world as we know it
735.366	didn't have to be.
736.922	It could've just been another day --
739.443	a Thursday, perhaps --
741.856	among the 63 billion days
741.856	already enjoyed by the dinosaurs.
747.313	But over geological time,
748.722	improbable, nearly impossible events
751.631	do occur.
752.806	Along the path from our wormy,
752.806	Cambrian ancestors
755.753	to primates dressed in suits,
758.18	innumerable forks in the road
758.18	led us to this very particular reality.
763.982	The bones of Dreadnoughtus
763.982	lay underground for 77 million years.
768.899	Who could have imagined
770.094	that a single species of shrew-like mammal
773.082	living in the cracks of the dinosaur world
775.15	would evolve into sentient beings
777.226	capable of characterizing
777.226	and understanding
779.606	the very dinosaurs they must have dreaded?
784.775	I once stood at the head
784.775	of the Missouri River
789.107	and bestraddled it.
791.123	There, it's nothing more
791.123	than a gurgle of water
793.349	that issues forth from beneath a rock
793.349	in a boulder in a pasture,
797.984	high in the Bitterroot Mountains.
800.165	The stream next to it
800.165	runs a few hundred yards
803.407	and ends in a small pond.
805.97	Those two streams -- they look identical.
809.732	But one is an anonymous trickle of water,
812.295	and the other is the Missouri River.
815.667	Now go down to the mouth
815.667	of the Missouri, near St. Louis,
819.188	and it's pretty obvious
819.188	that that river is a big deal.
822.64	But go up into the Bitterroots
822.64	and look at the Missouri,
825.378	and human prospection does not
825.378	allow us to see it as anything special.
831.03	Now go back to the Cretaceous Period
833.008	and look at our tiny, fuzzball ancestors.
835.477	You would never guess
836.938	that they would amount
836.938	to anything special,
839.039	and they probably wouldn't have,
840.711	were it not for that pesky asteroid.
843.797	Now, make a thousand more worlds
843.797	and a thousand more solar systems
847.182	and let them run.
849.047	You will never get the same result.
851.225	No doubt, those worlds would be
851.225	both amazing and amazingly improbable,
854.654	but they would not be our world
854.654	and they would not have our history.
857.986	There are an infinite number of histories
857.986	that we could've had.
860.989	We only get one, and wow,
860.989	did we ever get a good one.
863.539	Dinosaurs like Dreadnoughtus were real.
867.058	Sea monsters like the mosasaur were real.
871.216	Dragonflies with the wingspan of an eagle
871.216	and pill bugs the length of a car
875.336	really existed.
879.192	Why study the ancient past?
882.652	Because it gives us perspective
885.065	and humility.
886.977	The dinosaurs died in the world's
886.977	fifth mass extinction,
890.433	snuffed out in a cosmic accident
890.433	through no fault of their own.
895.114	They didn't see it coming,
895.114	and they didn't have a choice.
900.009	We, on the other hand, do have a choice.
903.943	And the nature of the fossil record
903.943	tells us that our place on this planet
907.958	is both precarious
907.958	and potentially fleeting.
911.127	Right now, our species is propagating
911.127	an environmental disaster
914.919	of geological proportions
914.919	that is so broad and so severe,
918.526	it can rightly be called
918.526	the sixth extinction.
922.429	Only unlike the dinosaurs,
925.128	we can see it coming.
927.438	And unlike the dinosaurs,
929.708	we can do something about it.
932.406	That choice is ours.
935.49	Thank you.
936.665	(Applause)
