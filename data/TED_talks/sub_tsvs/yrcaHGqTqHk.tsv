16.098	In the past several days, I heard people talking about China.
20.709	And also, I talked to friends about China and Chinese Internet.
24.663	Something is very challenging to me.
27.126	I want to make my friends understand:
30.187	China is complicated.
33.755	So I always want to tell the story, like,
35.85	one hand it is that, the other hand is that.
39.306	You can't just tell a one sided story.
42.092	I'll give an example. China is a BRIC country.
45.273	BRIC country means Brazil, Russia, India and China.
50.683	This emerging economy really is helping the revival of the world economy.
56.509	But at the same time, on the other hand,
59.678	China is a SICK country,
62.582	the terminology coined by Facebook IPO papers -- file.
68.538	He said the SICK country means Syria, Iran, China and North Korea.
74.82	The four countries have no access to Facebook.
79.5	So basically, China is a SICK BRIC country.
83.618	(Laughter)
84.612	Another project was built up
86.507	to watch China and Chinese Internet.
89.351	And now, today I want to tell you my personal
92.734	observation in the past several years, from that wall.
97.966	So, if you are a fan of the Game of Thrones,
101.527	you definitely know how important a big wall is for an old kingdom.
106.51	It prevents weird things from the north.
111.386	Same was true for China.
114.583	In the north, there was a great wall, Chang Cheng.
118.143	It protected China from invaders for 2,000 years.
123.515	But China also has a great firewall.
127.578	That's the biggest digital boundary in the whole world.
131.907	It's not only to defend the Chinese regime from overseas,
136.232	from the universal values, but also to prevent
139.936	China's own citizens to access the global free Internet,
143.611	and even separate themselves into blocks, not united.
148.899	"So, basically the ""Internet"" has two Internets."
153.045	One is the Internet, the other is the Chinanet.
157.037	But if you think the Chinanet is something
160.829	like a deadland, wasteland, I think it's wrong.
167.351	But we also use a very simple metaphor, the cat and the mouse game,
173.088	to describe in the past 15 years
176.111	the continuing fight between Chinese
179.511	censorship, government censorship, the cat,
182.791	and the Chinese Internet users. That means us, the mouse.
188.943	But sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple.
193.136	So today I want to upgrade it to 2.0 version.
198.571	In China, we have 500 million Internet users.
202.333	That's the biggest population of Netizens, Internet users, in the whole world.
207.188	So even though China's is a totally censored Internet,
212.699	but still, Chinese Internet society is really booming.
216.293	How to make it? It's simple.
219.003	You have Google, we have Baidu.
221.704	You have Twitter, we have Weibo.
224.818	You have Facebook, we have Renren.
227.843	You have YouTube, we have Youku and Tudou.
233.176	The Chinese government blocked every
237.706	single international Web 2.0 service,
241.417	and we Chinese copycat every one.
244.233	(Laughter)
245.626	So, that's the kind of the thing I call smart censorship.
250.241	That's not only to censor you.
253.809	Sometimes this Chinese national Internet policy is very simple:
258.408	Block and clone.
260.795	On the one hand, he wants to satisfy people's need of a social network,
265.899	which is very important; people really love social networking.
269.179	But on the other hand, they want to keep the server
272.004	in Beijing so they can access the data any time they want.
276.534	That's also the reason Google was pulled out from China,
280.782	because they can't accept the fact
282.591	that Chinese government wants to keep the server.
287.39	Sometimes the Arab dictators didn't understand these two hands.
292.818	For example, Mubarak, he shut down the Internet.
296.571	He wanted to prevent the Netizens [from criticizing] him.
299.683	But once Netizens can't go online, they go in the street.
305.373	And now the result is very simple.
308.653	We all know Mubarak is technically dead.
314.263	But also, Ben Ali, Tunisian president,
318.775	didn't follow the second rule.
320.701	That means keep the server in your hands.
324.654	He allowed Facebook, a U.S.-based service,
330.499	to continue to stay on inside of Tunisia.
333.901	So he can't prevent it, his own citizens to post
337.473	critical videos against his corruption.
340.125	The same thing happend. He was the first
344.174	to topple during the Arab Spring.
347.191	But those two very smart international censorship policies
352.341	didn't prevent Chinese social media [from] becoming a really public sphere,
358.678	a pathway of public opinion and the nightmare of Chinese officials.
364.351	Because we have 300 million microbloggers in China.
368.879	It's the entire population of the United States.
372.711	So when these 300 million people, microbloggers,
376.575	even they block the tweet in our censored platform.
381.343	But itself -- the Chinanet -- but itself can create
385.33	very powerful energy, which has never happened
389.425	in the Chinese history.
395.775	in Wenzhou, a southern city.
398.031	Right after the train crash,
399.655	authorities literally wanted to cover up the train, bury the train.
404.671	So it angered the Chinese Netizens.
406.887	The first five days after the train crash,
409.95	there were 10 million criticisms of the posting
414.095	on social media, which never happened in Chinese history.
417.848	And later this year, the rail minister
421.176	was sacked and sentenced to jail for 10 years.
426.642	And also, recently, very funny debate between
431.689	the Beijing Environment Ministry
434.985	and the American Embassy in Beijing
438.353	because the Ministry blamed
440.818	the American Embassy for intervening in
442.963	Chinese internal politics by disclosing
446.392	the air quality data of Beijing.
449.076	So, the up is the Embassy data, the PM 2.5.
455.964	He showed 148, they showed it's dangerous for the sensitive group.
461.908	So a suggestion, it's not good to go outside.
465.71	But that is the Ministry's data. He shows 50.
471.334	He says it's good. It's good to go outside.
474.686	But 99 percent of Chinese microbloggers
478.23	stand firmly on the Embassy's side.
481.99	I live in Beijing. Every day, I just watch
486.662	the American Embassy's data to decide whether I should open my window.
495.393	Why is Chinese social networking, even within the censorship,
499.684	so booming? Part of the reason is Chinese languages.
503.928	You know, Twitter and Twitter clones have a kind of
507.6	a limitation of 140 characters.
510.065	But in English it's 20 words or a sentence with a short link.
514.264	"Maybe in Germany, in German language, it may be just ""Aha!"""
517.512	(Laughter)
520.046	But in Chinese language, it's really about 140 characters,
525.791	means a paragraph, a story.
528.467	You can almost have all the journalistic elements there.
532.705	For example, this is Hamlet, of Shakespeare.
536.392	It's the same content. One, you can see exactly
540.183	one Chinese tweet is equal to 3.5 English tweets.
546.696	Chinese is always cheating, right?
549.953	So because of this, the Chinese really regard this
553.866	microblogging as a media, not only a headline to media.
558.947	And also, the clone, Sina company is
562.658	the guy who cloned Twitter.
564.745	It even has its own name, with Weibo.
567.166	"""Weibo"" is the Chinese translation for ""microblog""."
569.601	It has its own innovation.
571.505	At the commenting area, [it makes] the Chinese Weibo
575.138	more like Facebook, rather than the original Twitter.
578.88	So these innovations and clones, as the Weibo and microblogging,
583.304	when it came to China in 2009,
585.624	it immediately became a media platform itself.
589.637	It became the media platform of 300 million readers.
593.838	It became the media.
595.739	Anything not mentioned in Weibo,
598.164	it does not appear to exist for the Chinese public.
603.448	But also, Chinese social media is
605.884	really changing Chinese mindsets and Chinese life.
610.279	For example, they give the voiceless people
613.768	a channel to make your voice heard.
616.521	We had a petition system. It's a remedy outside the judicial system,
621.964	because the Chinese central government wants to keep a myth:
625.041	The emperor is good. The old local officials are thugs.
629.667	So that's why the petitioner, the victims, the peasants,
633.058	want to take the train to Beijing to petition to the central government,
636.689	they want the emperor to settle the problem.
639.484	But when more and more people go to Beijing,
642.323	they also cause the risk of a revolution.
645.846	So they send them back in recent years.
648.718	And even some of them were put into black jails.
652.285	But now we have Weibo, so I call it the Weibo petition.
655.886	People just use their cell phones to tweet.
658.725	So your sad stories, by some chance your story
662.302	will be picked up by reporters, professors or celebrities.
665.943	One of them is Yao Chen,
667.856	she is the most popular microblogger in China,
671.245	who has about 21 million followers.
675.104	They're almost like a national TV station.
678.726	If you -- so a sad story will be picked up by her.
682.062	So this Weibo social media, even in the censorship,
686.51	still gave the Chinese a real chance for 300 million people
692.25	every day chatting together, talking together.
695.574	It's like a big TED, right?
698.48	But also, it is like the first time a public sphere
702.328	happened in China.
704.032	Chinese people start to learn how to negotiate
707.247	and talk to people.
710.432	But also, the cat, the censorship, is not sleeping.
714.136	It's so hard to post some sensitive words on the Chinese Weibo.
718.382	For example, you can't post the name of the president,
721.589	Hu Jintao, and also you can't post the city of Chongqing, the name,
727.167	and until recently, you can't search the surname of top leaders.
731.901	So, the Chinese are very good at these puns
736.234	and alternative wording and even memes.
739.906	They even name themselves -- you know,
742.151	use the name of this world-changing
744.646	battle between the grass-mud horse and the river crab.
748.617	The grass-mud horse is caoníma,
750.626	is the phonogram for motherfucker,
753.58	the Netizens call themselves.
759.796	River crab is héxiè, is the phonogram for
762.413	harmonization, for censorship.
765.307	So that's kind of a caoníma versus the héxiè, that's very good.
770.427	So, when some very political, exciting moments happened,
776.404	you can see on Weibo, you see a lot of very weird stories happened.
781.985	Weird phrases and words, even if you have a PhD
786.817	of Chinese language, you can't understand them.
790.284	But you can't even expand more, no, because
793.107	Chinese Sina Weibo, when it was founded
796.03	was exactly one month after the official blocking of Twitter.com.
801.166	That means from the very beginning,
803.262	Weibo has already convinced the Chinese government,
807.454	we will not become the stage for
810.198	any kind of a threat to the regime.
812.79	For example, anything you want to post,
814.99	"like ""get together"" or ""meet up"" or ""walk,"""
817.885	it is automatically recorded and data mined
822.078	and reported to a poll for further political analyzing.
828.606	Even if you want to have some gathering,
830.606	before you go there, the police are already waiting for you.
834.286	Why? Because they have the data.
836.094	They have everything in their hands.
838.286	So they can use the 1984 scenario data mining of the dissident.
844.51	So the crackdown is very serious.
848.109	But I want you to notice a very funny thing
850.65	during the process of the cat-and-mouse.
853.538	The cat is the censorship, but Chinese is not only one cat,
857.763	but also has local cats. Central cat and local cats.
861.391	(Laughter)
863.317	You know, the server is in the [central] cats' hands,
866.391	so even that -- when the Netizens criticize the local government,
871.013	the local government has not any access to the data in Beijing.
875.651	Without bribing the central cats,
877.539	he can do nothing, only apologize.
880.965	So these three years, in the past three years,
883.693	social movements about microblogging
886.339	really changed local government,
888.7	became more and more transparent,
890.956	because they can't access the data.
893.804	The server is in Beijing.
897.417	The story about the train crash,
898.887	maybe the question is not about why 10 million
902.094	criticisms in five days, but why the Chinese central government
906.34	allowed the five days of freedom of speech online.
909.564	It's never happened before.
911.473	And so it's very simple, because even the top leaders
914.924	were fed up with this guy, this independent kingdom.
918.445	So they want an excuse --
920.115	public opinion is a very good excuse to punish him.
923.572	But also, the Bo Xilai case recently, very big news,
926.542	he's a princeling.
927.873	But from February to April this year,
931.992	Weibo really became a marketplace of rumors.
934.695	You can almost joke everything about these princelings,
938.032	everything! It's almost like you're living in the United States.
941.432	But if you dare to retweet or mention any fake coup
946.081	about Beijing, you definitely will be arrested.
950.024	So this kind of freedom is a targeted and precise window.
955.947	So Chinese in China, censorship is normal.
959.816	Something you find is, freedom is weird.
962.561	Something will happen behind it.
964.328	Because he was a very popular Leftist leader,
967.484	so the central government wanted to purge him,
969.688	and he was very cute, he convinced all the Chinese people,
973.77	why he is so bad.
975.6	So Weibo, the 300 million public sphere,
979.378	became a very good, convenient tool for a political fight.
983.889	But this technology is very new,
986.046	but technically is very old.
987.712	It was made famous by Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong,
990.64	because he mobilized millions of Chinese people
993.537	in the Cultural Revolution to destroy every local government.
997.619	It's very simple, because Chinese central government
1000.489	doesn't need to even lead the public opinion.
1002.625	They just give them a target window to not censor people.
1007.156	Not censoring in China has become a political tool.
1013.065	So that's the update about this game, cat-and-mouse.
1017.035	Social media changed Chinese mindset.
1019.205	More and more Chinese intend to embrace freedom of speech
1022.715	and human rights as their birthright,
1024.875	not some imported American privilege.
1028.497	But also, it gave the Chinese a national public sphere
1032.209	for people to, it's like a training of their citizenship,
1036.539	preparing for future democracy.
1039.11	But it didn't change the Chinese political system,
1041.566	and also the Chinese central government utilized this
1044.811	centralized server structure to strengthen its power
1048.747	to counter the local government and the different factions.
1053.245	So, what's the future?
1056.017	After all, we are the mouse.
1058.201	Whatever the future is, we should fight against the [cat].
1062.001	There is not only in China, but also in the United States
1065.992	there are some very small, cute but bad cats.
1070.821	(Laughter)
1072.465	SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, TPP and ITU.
1079.203	And also, like Facebook and Google, they claim they are friends of the mouse,
1084.558	but sometimes we see them dating the cats.
1088.745	So my conclusion is very simple.
1091.929	We Chinese fight for our freedom,
1094.774	you just watch your bad cats.
1098.369	Don't let them hook [up] with the Chinese cats.
1101.272	Only in this way, in the future,
1104.113	we will achieve the dreams of the mouse:
1107.361	that we can tweet anytime, anywhere, without fear.
1111.337	(Applause)
1118.696	Thank you.
1120.381	(Applause)
