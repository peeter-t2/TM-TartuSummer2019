12.54	Every summer, my family and I
12.54	travel across the world,
17.26	3,000 miles away
19.14	to the culturally diverse
19.14	country of India.
22.58	Now, India is a country infamous
22.58	for its scorching heat and humidity.
27.58	For me, the only relief from this heat
27.58	is to drink plenty of water.
32.74	Now, while in India,
34.26	my parents always remind me
34.26	to only drink boiled or bottled water,
39.22	because unlike here in America,
41.5	where I can just turn on a tap
41.5	and easily get clean, potable water,
46.3	in India, the water is often contaminated.
49.26	So my parents have to make sure
51.18	that the water we drink is safe.
54.3	However, I soon realized
56.7	that not everyone is fortunate enough
59.38	to enjoy the clean water we did.
62.98	Outside my grandparents' house
62.98	in the busy streets of India,
67.22	I saw people standing in long lines
69.9	under the hot sun
71.62	filling buckets with water from a tap.
75.18	I even saw children,
77.18	who looked the same age as me,
79.86	filling up these clear plastic bottles
82.26	with dirty water
82.26	from streams on the roadside.
86.7	Watching these kids
88.42	forced to drink water
90.58	that I felt was too dirty to touch
93.62	changed my perspective on the world.
96.86	This unacceptable social injustice
100.42	compelled me to want to find a solution
103.5	to our world's clean water problem.
106.66	I wanted to know
106.66	why these kids lacked water,
109.94	a substance that is essential for life.
112.82	And I learned that we are facing
115.1	a global water crisis.
118.54	Now, this may seem surprising,
120.38	as 75 percent of our planet
120.38	is covered in water,
124.5	but only 2.5 percent
124.5	of that is freshwater,
128.58	and less than one percent
128.58	of Earth's freshwater supply
132.54	is available for human consumption.
135.58	With rising populations,
137.3	industrial development
137.3	and economic growth,
140.299	our demand for clean water is increasing,
143.1	yet our freshwater resources
143.1	are rapidly depleting.
147.66	According to the
147.66	World Health Organization,
154.22	lack access to a clean water source.
157.78	Lack of access to clean water
157.78	is a leading cause of death
161.1	in children under the age of five
161.1	in developing countries,
164.14	and UNICEF estimates that 3,000 children
167.62	die every day from
167.62	a water-related disease.
172.1	So after returning home
172.1	one summer in eighth grade,
175.5	I decided that I wanted
175.5	to combine my passion
178.62	for solving the global water crisis
180.78	with my interest in science.
183.26	So I decided that the best thing to do
185.42	would be to convert my garage
185.42	into a laboratory.
190.98	(Laughter)
192.98	Actually, at first I converted
192.98	my kitchen into a laboratory,
196.86	but my parents didn't really approve
196.86	and kicked me out.
201.22	I also read a lot of journal papers
201.22	on water-related research,
205.7	and I learned that currently
205.7	in developing countries,
208.58	something called solar disinfection,
211.02	or SODIS, is used to purify water.
214.82	In SODIS, clear plastic bottles
214.82	are filled with contaminated water
219.66	and then exposed to sunlight
219.66	for six to eight hours.
223.34	The UV radiation from the sun
225.38	destroys the DNA
225.38	of these harmful pathogens
228.86	and decontaminates the water.
231.7	Now, while SODIS is really easy to use
231.7	and energy-efficient,
235.46	as it only uses solar energy,
237.78	it's really slow,
239.18	as it can take up to two days
239.18	when it's cloudy.
242.78	So in order to make
242.78	the SODIS process faster,
245.9	this new method called photocatalysis
249.22	has recently been used.
251.46	So what exactly is this photocatalysis?
254.34	Let's break it down:
255.58	"""photo"" means from the sun,"
257.26	and a catalyst is something
257.26	that speeds up a reaction.
260.86	So what photocatalysis is doing
263.06	is it's just speeding up
263.06	this solar disinfection process.
267.22	When sunlight comes in
267.22	and strikes a photocatalyst,
270.58	like TiO2, or titanium dioxide,
274.22	it creates these
274.22	really reactive oxygen species,
277.66	like superoxides, hydrogen peroxide
277.66	and hydroxyl radicals.
282.74	These reactive oxygen species
284.66	are able to remove bacteria and organics
287.58	and a whole lot of contaminants
287.58	from drinking water.
291.74	But unfortunately,
291.74	there are several disadvantages
294.98	to the way photocatalytic SODIS
294.98	is currently deployed.
299.46	See, what they do is they take
299.46	the clear plastic bottles
302.62	and they coat the inside
302.62	with this photocatalytic coating.
307.02	But photocatalysts like titanium dioxide
310.34	are actually commonly used in sunscreens
313.06	to block UV radiation.
315.14	So when they're coated
315.14	on the inside of these bottles,
318.02	they're actually blocking
318.02	some of the UV radiation
320.82	and diminishing the efficiency
320.82	of the process.
324.38	Also, these photocatalytic coatings
326.54	are not tightly bound
326.54	to the plastic bottle,
329.42	which means they wash off,
329.42	and people end up drinking the catalyst.
334.34	While TiO2 is safe and inert,
337.02	it's really inefficient
337.02	if you keep drinking the catalyst,
339.78	because then you have
339.78	to continue to replenish it,
342.18	even after a few uses.
344.26	So my goal was
344.26	to overcome the disadvantages
347.54	of these current treatment methods
349.58	and create a safe, sustainable,
351.86	cost-effective and eco-friendly
351.86	method of purifying water.
356.94	What started off as an eighth grade
356.94	science fair project
360.02	is now my photocatalytic composite
360.02	for water purification.
365.26	The composite combines
365.26	titanium dioxide with cement.
369.66	The cement-like composite can be formed
369.66	into several different shapes,
373.66	which results in an extremely
373.66	versatile range of deployment methods.
377.98	For example, you could create a rod
380.06	that can easily be placed
380.06	inside water bottles for individual use
384.38	or you could create a porous filter
384.38	that can filter water for families.
389.62	You can even coat the inside
389.62	of an existing water tank
393.06	to purify larger amounts of water
394.94	for communities
394.94	over a longer period of time.
399.46	Now, over the course of this,
401.42	my journey hasn't really been easy.
403.9	You know, I didn't have access
403.9	to a sophisticated laboratory.
407.3	I was 14 years old when I started,
410.82	but I didn't let my age deter me
413.18	in my interest
413.18	in pursuing scientific research
416.06	and wanting to solve
416.06	the global water crisis.
419.62	See, water isn't
419.62	just the universal solvent.
423.46	Water is a universal human right.
426.98	And for that reason,
428.26	I'm continuing to work
428.26	on this science fair project from 2012
432.46	to bring it from the laboratory
432.46	into the real world.
435.66	And this summer,
435.66	I founded Catalyst for World Water,
439.14	a social enterprise aimed at catalyzing
439.14	solutions to the global water crisis.
445.1	(Applause)
452.06	Alone, a single drop of water
452.06	can't do much,
456.06	but when many drops come together,
458.5	they can sustain life on our planet.
462.1	Just as water drops
462.1	come together to form oceans,
465.46	I believe that we all must come together
468.02	when tackling this global problem.
470.9	Thank you.
472.14	(Applause)
475.66	Thank you.
477.02	(Applause)
