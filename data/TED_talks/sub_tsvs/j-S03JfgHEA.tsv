12.117	So this is Anna Hazare,
15.769	and Anna Hazare may well be
15.769	the most cutting-edge
19.677	digital activist in the world today.
22.914	And you wouldn't know it by looking at him.
24.452	Hazare is a 77-year-old Indian 
24.452	anticorruption and social justice activist.
30.099	And in 2011, he was running a big campaign
33.69	to address everyday corruption in India,
36.65	a topic that Indian elites love to ignore.
39.521	So as part of this campaign,
41.103	he was using all of the traditional tactics
43.025	that a good Gandhian organizer would use.
45.241	So he was on a hunger strike,
47.297	and Hazare realized through his hunger
49.822	that actually maybe this time,
51.599	in the 21st century,
53.345	a hunger strike wouldn't be enough.
54.834	So he started playing around 
54.834	with mobile activism.
59.126	So the first thing he did 
59.126	is he said to people,
61.013	"""Okay, why don't you send me"
63.084	a text message if you support
64.845	"my campaign against corruption?"""
66.585	So he does this, he 
66.585	gives people a short code,
68.854	and about 80,000 people do it.
71.47	Okay, that's pretty respectable.
73.438	But then he decides,
74.375	"""Let me tweak my tactics a little bit."""
76.495	"He says, ""Why don't you leave"
76.495	"me a missed call?"""
80.97	Now, for those of you who have
80.97	lived in the global South,
84.039	you'll know that missed calls
85.531	are a really critical part
85.531	of global mobile culture.
89.374	I see people nodding.
90.488	People leave missed calls all the time:
92.596	If you're running late for a meeting
94.542	and you just want to let them
94.542	know that you're on the way,
96.848	you leave them a missed call.
98.571	If you're dating someone and 
98.571	"you just want to say ""I miss you"""
100.497	you leave them a missed call.
101.883	So a note for a dating tip here,
104.427	in some cultures,
105.552	if you want to please your lover,
106.834	you call them and hang up.
106.834	(Laughter)
111.335	So why do people leave missed calls?
114.69	Well, the reason of course is that
116.14	they're trying to avoid charges
118.898	associated with making calls
118.898	and sending texts.
122.264	So when Hazare asked people 
122.264	to leave him a missed call,
126.32	let's have a little guess how 
126.32	many people actually did this?
131.997	Thirty-five million.
135.415	So this is one of the largest coordinated
135.415	actions in human history.
139.458	It's remarkable.
141.212	And this reflects the extraordinary strength 
141.212	of the emerging Indian middle class
145.712	and the power that their
145.712	mobile phones bring.
148.684	But he used that,
150.269	Hazare ended up with this massive 
150.269	CSV file of mobile phone numbers,
154.488	and he used that to deploy
156.273	real people power on the ground
158.269	to get hundreds of thousands of
158.269	people out on the streets in Delhi
161.683	to make a national point of 
161.683	everyday corruption in India.
166.033	It's a really striking story.
168.47	So this is me when I was 12 years old.
170.68	I hope you see the resemblance.
172.392	And I was also an activist,
174.317	and I have been an activist all my life.
176.557	I had this really funny childhood
177.887	where I traipsed around the world
179.91	meeting world leaders and 
179.91	Noble prize winners,
182.704	talking about Third World debt,
184.99	as it was then called,
186.279	and demilitarization.
187.813	I was a very, very serious child.
187.813	(Laughter)
192.045	And back then,
193.95	in the early '90s,
195.384	I had a very cutting-edge
195.384	tech tool of my own:
199.214	the fax.
201.466	And the fax was the 
201.466	tool of my activism.
203.644	And at that time, it was the best way
205.202	to get a message to a lot of people
207.097	all at once.
209.535	I'll give you one example of a fax
209.535	campaign that I ran.
211.981	It was the eve of the Gulf War
214.077	and I organized a global campaign 
214.077	to flood the hotel,
217.628	the Intercontinental in Geneva,
219.109	where James Baker and Tariq Aziz
220.664	were meeting on the eve of the war,
222.588	and I thought if I could 
222.588	flood them with faxes,
224.972	we'll stop the war.
226.05	Well, unsurprisingly,
228.243	that campaign was wholly unsuccessful.
231.834	There are lots of reasons for that,
233.488	but there's no doubt that 
233.488	one sputtering fax machine
235.973	in Geneva was a little bit
235.973	of a bandwidth constraint
239.3	in terms of the ability to 
239.3	get a message to lots of people.
242.142	And so, I went on to 
242.142	discover some better tools.
246.172	I cofounded Avaaz, which uses the 
246.172	Internet to mobilize people
248.814	and now has almost 
251.412	and I now run Purpose, which 
251.412	is a home for these kinds of
253.972	technology-powered movements.
256.268	So what's the moral of this story?
258.088	Is the moral of this story,
259.596	you know what, the fax is kind of
259.596	eclipsed by the mobile phone?
264.705	This is another story of 
264.705	tech-determinism?
266.935	Well, I would argue that there's 
266.935	actually more to it than that.
270.125	I'd argue that in the last 20 years,
272.798	something more fundamental has changed
275.036	than just new tech.
276.741	I would argue that there has
276.741	been a fundamental shift
279.561	in the balance of power
281.709	in the world.
283.228	You ask any activist how 
283.228	to understand the world,
285.145	and they'll say,
285.145	"""Look at where the power is,"
287.619	"who has it, how it's shifting."""
290.077	And I think we all sense that 
290.077	something big is happening.
293.079	So Henry Timms and I —
295.523	Henry's a fellow movement builder —
297.371	got talking one day and 
297.371	we started to think,
299.273	how can we make sense of this new world?
301.274	How can we describe it and give
302.463	it a framework that makes it more useful?
304.906	Because we realized that many
306.136	of the lessons that we were
306.136	discovering in movements
308.95	actually applied all over the world
311.657	in many sectors of our society.
313.779	So I want to introduce you to
313.779	this framework:
315.656	Old power, meet new power.
317.876	And I want to talk to you about
317.876	what new power is today.
321.307	New power is the deployment
323.271	of mass participation 
323.271	and peer coordination —
326.46	these are the two key elements —
328.102	to create change and shift outcomes.
330.599	And we see new power all around us.
333.687	This is Beppe Grillo
334.971	he was a populist Italian blogger
337.116	who, with a minimal political apparatus
337.116	and only some online tools,
340.536	won more than 25 percent of the vote
343.034	in recent Italian elections.
345.455	This is Airbnb,
346.817	which in just a few years
348.566	has radically disrupted the hotel industry
350.728	without owning a single
350.728	square foot of real estate.
353.646	This is Kickstarter,
355.001	which we know has raised over a billion dollars
357.898	from more than five million people.
360.319	Now, we're familiar with all of these models.
362.249	But what's striking is the commonalities,
365.45	the structural features of 
365.45	these new models
367.576	and how they differ from old power.
369.725	Let's look a little bit at this.
371.394	Old power is held like a currency.
374.552	New power works like a current.
376.531	Old power is held by a few.
379.033	New power isn't held by a few,
379.033	it's made by many.
382.473	Old power is all about download,
384.98	and new power uploads.
386.706	And you see a whole set of 
386.706	characteristics that you can trace,
389.24	whether it's in media or 
389.24	politics or education.
392.356	So we've talked a little bit 
392.356	about what new power is.
394.422	Let's, for a second, talk about 
394.422	what new power isn't.
397.587	New power is not your Facebook page.
401.383	I assure you that having a 
401.383	social media strategy
404.208	can enable you to do just as much download
406.756	as you used to do when you had the radio.
409.618	Just ask Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad,
413.146	I assure you that his Facebook page
414.888	has not embraced the power
414.888	of participation.
419.015	New power is not inherently positive.
422.413	In fact, this isn't an normative
422.413	argument that we're making,
424.702	there are many good things 
424.702	about new power,
426.514	but it can produce bad outcomes.
428.331	More participation, more peer coordination,
430.336	sometimes distorts outcomes
432.123	and there are some things,
433.198	like things, for example, 
433.198	in the medical profession
435.297	that we want new power 
435.297	to get nowhere near.
438.293	And thirdly, new power is not
438.293	the inevitable victor.
441.296	In fact, unsurprisingly,
442.875	as many of these new power
442.875	models get to scale,
445.864	what you see is this massive pushback
448.334	from the forces of old power.
450.083	Just look at this really 
450.083	interesting epic struggle
452.292	going on right now between 
452.292	Edward Snowden and the NSA.
456.675	You'll note that only one of 
456.675	the two people on this slide
459.059	is currently in exile.
461.238	And so, it's not at all clear
462.653	that new power will be 
462.653	the inevitable victor.
464.743	That said, keep one thing in mind:
467.686	We're at the beginning of a
467.686	very steep curve.
470.575	So you think about some of 
470.575	these new power models, right?
472.216	These were just like someone's
474.328	garage idea a few years ago,
476.874	and now they're disrupting 
476.874	entire industries.
480.01	And so, what's interesting
480.01	about new power,
482.679	is the way it feeds
482.679	on itself.
484.695	Once you have an experience of new power,
486.719	you tend to expect and 
486.719	want more of it.
488.909	So let's say you've used a
488.909	peer-to-peer lending platform
491.789	like Lending Tree or Prosper,
494.323	then you've figured out that
494.323	you don't need the bank,
496.607	and who wants the bank, right?
498.544	And so, that experience tends 
498.544	to embolden you
500.982	it tends to make you want
500.982	more participation
503.919	across more aspects of your life.
506.264	And what this gives rise to is
507.809	a set of values.
509.38	We talked about the models
510.69	that new power has engendered —
512.284	the Airbnbs, the Kickstarters.
514.116	What about the values?
515.645	And this is an early sketch
517.315	at what new power values look like.
519.878	New power values prize
519.878	transparency above all else.
523.009	It's almost a religious 
523.009	belief in transparency,
525.231	a belief that if you shine 
525.231	a light on something,
527.495	it will be better.
528.926	And remember that in the 20th 
528.926	century, this was not at all true.
531.676	People thought that gentlemen
531.676	should sit behind closed doors
534.643	and make comfortable agreements.
536.925	New power values of informal,
536.925	networked governance.
540.33	New power folks would never 
540.33	have invented the U.N. today,
542.974	for better or worse.
544.807	New power values participation,
546.522	and new power is all about do-it-yourself.
549.317	In fact, what's interesting 
549.317	about new power
550.806	is that it eschews some of 
550.806	the professionalization
554.519	and specialization that was
555.994	all the rage in the 20th century.
558.384	So what's interesting about these
560.194	new power values and these
560.194	new power models
562.16	is what they mean for organizations.
564.455	So we've spent a bit of time thinking,
566.963	how can we plot organizations
569.229	on a two-by-two where, essentially,
571.493	we look at new power values
573.549	and new power models
574.813	and see where different people sit?
576.614	We started with a U.S. analysis,
578.503	and let me show you 
578.503	some interesting findings.
580.879	So the first is Apple.
582.858	In this framework, we actually
582.858	described Apple
585.393	as an old power company.
587.515	That's because the ideology,
589.169	the governing ideology of Apple
591.457	is the ideology of the perfectionist
594.331	product designer in Cupertino.
596.355	It's absolutely about that beautiful, 
596.355	perfect thing descending upon us
600.427	in perfection.
601.778	And it does not value, as a 
601.778	company, transparency.
604.401	In fact, it's very secretive.
606.064	Now, Apple is one of the most
606.064	succesful companies in the world.
608.89	So this shows that you can
610.262	still pursue a successful 
610.262	old power strategy.
612.951	But one can argue that there's 
612.951	real vulnerabilites in that model.
615.921	I think another interesting comparison
617.945	is that of the Obama campaign
620.122	versus the Obama presidency.
623.238	(Applause)
630.7	Now, I like President Obama,
632.447	but he ran with new 
632.447	power at his back, right?
636.403	And he said to people,
638.23	we are the ones we've
638.23	been waiting for.
640.203	And he used crowdfunding
641.654	to power a campaign.
642.865	But when he got into office,
644.266	he governed like more or less 
644.266	all the other presidents did.
647.458	And this is a really interesting trend,
649.822	is when new power gets powerful,
651.82	what happens?
653.391	So this is a framework you 
653.391	should look at
655.155	and think about where your
655.155	own organization
656.647	sits on it.
657.611	And think about where it
657.611	should be 
659.184	in five or 10 years.
660.732	So what do you do if you're old power?
663.197	Well, if you're there 
663.197	thinking, in old power,
666.162	this won't happen to us.
668.062	Then just look at the Wikipedia
668.062	entry for Encyclopædia Britannica.
673.229	Let me tell you, it's a very sad read.
675.625	But if you are old power,
677.044	the most important thing you 
677.044	can do is to occupy yourself
680.837	before others occupy you,
683.491	before you are occupied.
684.819	Imagine that a group
684.819	of your biggest skeptics
687.592	are camped in the heart
687.592	of your organization
689.944	asking the toughest questions
691.823	and they can see everything
691.823	inside of your organization.
694.751	And ask them, would they 
694.751	like what they see
697.501	and should our model change?
699.776	What about if you're new power?
701.639	Is new power kind of just 
701.639	riding the wave to glory?
704.273	I would argue no.
705.753	I would argue that there
705.753	are some very real challenges
707.709	to new power in this nascent phase.
709.401	Let's stick with the Occupy Wall Street
709.401	example for a moment.
712.903	Occupy was this incredible example 
712.903	of new power,
715.893	the purest example of new power.
717.736	And yet, it failed to consolidate.
720.267	So the energy that it created
722.164	was great for the meme phase,
723.605	but they were so committed to participation,
726.406	that they never got anything done.
728.04	And in fact that model
729.831	means that the challenge for new power is:
732.623	how do you use institutional power
735.162	without being institutionalized?
737.233	One the other end of the spectra is Uber.
739.866	Uber is an amazing,
741.25	highly scalable new power model.
743.303	That network is getting denser and denser
745.329	by the day.
746.589	But what's really interesting 
746.589	about Uber is
748.748	it hasn't really adopted new power values.
752.489	This is a real quote from 
752.489	the Uber CEO recently:
756.561	"He says, ""Once we get rid of the dude "
756.561	"in the car"" — he means drivers —"
761.009	"""Uber will be cheaper."""
764.901	Now, new power models
764.901	live and die
767.876	by the strength of their networks.
770.058	By whether the drivers and the consumers
771.991	who use the service actually believe in it.
774.332	Because they're not an exercise 
774.332	of top-down perfectionism,
777.833	they are about the network.
779.781	And so, the challenge,
781.477	and this is why it's in
781.477	no way surprising,
783.727	is that Uber's drivers 
783.727	are now unionizing.
787.983	It's extraordinary.
789.583	Uber's drivers are turning on Uber.
791.872	And the challenge for Uber —
793.166	this isn't an easy situation for them —
795.093	is that they are locked into
795.093	a broader superstrcuture
798.389	that is really old power.
800.074	They've raised more than a billion 
800.074	dollars in the capital markets.
803.082	Those markets expect a financial return,
805.61	and they way you get a financial return
807.527	is by squeezing and squeezing
809.924	your users and your drivers
812.169	for more and more value
813.464	and giving that value to your investors.
815.931	So the big question about the future 
815.931	of new power, in my view, is:
819.534	Will that old power just emerge?
822.093	So will new power elites just become
823.876	old power and squeeze?
825.765	Or will that new power
825.765	base bite back?
828.378	Will the next big Uber
830.139	be co-owned by Uber drivers?
832.519	And I think this going 
832.519	to be a very interesting
835.302	structural question.
837.204	Finally, think about new power
840.486	being more than just an
842.853	entity that scales things 
844.489	that make us have slightly 
844.489	better consumer experiences.
848.205	My call to action for new power
850.371	is to not be an island.
852.779	We have major structural
852.779	problems in the world today
855.935	that could benefit enormously
858.191	from the kinds of mass participation
860.505	and peer coordination
861.842	that these new power players
863.57	know so well how to generate.
865.966	And we badly need them to 
865.966	turn their energies and their power
869.479	to big, what economists might call
872.703	public goods problems,
874.276	that are often beyond markets
876.322	where investors can easily be found.
878.332	And I think if we can do that,
880.222	we might be able to fundamentally change
883.207	not only human beings' sense of 
883.207	their own agency and power —
886.738	because I think that's the most
886.738	wonderful thing about new power,
889.596	is that people feel more powerful —
892.348	but we might also be able to change
894.129	the way we relate to each other
895.892	and the way we relate to 
895.892	authority and institutions.
899.003	And to me, that's absolutely
901.051	worth trying for.
902.622	Thank you very much.
