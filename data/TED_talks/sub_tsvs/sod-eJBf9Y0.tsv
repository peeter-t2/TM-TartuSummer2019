12.605	Growth is not dead.
14.877	(Applause)
16.263	Let's start the story 120 years ago,
20.226	when American factories began to electrify their operations,
23.858	igniting the Second Industrial Revolution.
27.202	The amazing thing is
28.313	that productivity did not increase in those factories
31.09	for 30 years. Thirty years.
34.346	That's long enough for a generation of managers to retire.
37.82	You see, the first wave of managers
40.042	simply replaced their steam engines with electric motors,
43.459	but they didn't redesign the factories to take advantage
46.469	of electricity's flexibility.
48.81	It fell to the next generation to invent new work processes,
52.794	and then productivity soared,
55.521	often doubling or even tripling in those factories.
59.186	Electricity is an example of a general purpose technology,
63.909	like the steam engine before it.
66.139	General purpose technologies drive most economic growth,
69.555	because they unleash cascades of complementary innovations,
73.009	like lightbulbs and, yes, factory redesign.
76.641	Is there a general purpose technology of our era?
80.251	Sure. It's the computer.
82.759	But technology alone is not enough.
85.418	Technology is not destiny.
88.184	We shape our destiny,
89.764	and just as the earlier generations of managers
92.28	needed to redesign their factories,
94.578	we're going to need to reinvent our organizations
96.807	and even our whole economic system.
99.362	We're not doing as well at that job as we should be.
102.964	As we'll see in a moment,
104.194	productivity is actually doing all right,
106.916	but it has become decoupled from jobs,
110.778	and the income of the typical worker is stagnating.
115.197	These troubles are sometimes misdiagnosed
117.716	as the end of innovation,
121.428	but they are actually the growing pains
123.557	of what Andrew McAfee and I call the new machine age.
129.147	Let's look at some data.
131.029	So here's GDP per person in America.
133.931	There's some bumps along the way, but the big story
136.697	is you could practically fit a ruler to it.
139.412	This is a log scale, so what looks like steady growth
142.688	is actually an acceleration in real terms.
145.731	And here's productivity.
147.891	You can see a little bit of a slowdown there in the mid-'70s,
150.562	but it matches up pretty well with the Second Industrial Revolution,
154.3	when factories were learning how to electrify their operations.
156.991	After a lag, productivity accelerated again.
161.12	"So maybe ""history doesn't repeat itself,"
163.691	"but sometimes it rhymes."""
166.259	Today, productivity is at an all-time high,
169.395	and despite the Great Recession,
171.372	it grew faster in the 2000s than it did in the 1990s,
175.624	the roaring 1990s, and that was faster than the '70s or '80s.
179.76	It's growing faster than it did during the Second Industrial Revolution.
183.434	And that's just the United States.
185.177	The global news is even better.
188.425	Worldwide incomes have grown at a faster rate
190.785	in the past decade than ever in history.
193.281	If anything, all these numbers actually understate our progress,
198.332	because the new machine age
200.244	is more about knowledge creation
201.908	than just physical production.
204.239	It's mind not matter, brain not brawn,
207.177	ideas not things.
209.239	That creates a problem for standard metrics,
211.809	because we're getting more and more stuff for free,
215.311	like Wikipedia, Google, Skype,
217.952	and if they post it on the web, even this TED Talk.
221.015	Now getting stuff for free is a good thing, right?
224.318	Sure, of course it is.
226.083	But that's not how economists measure GDP.
229.951	Zero price means zero weight in the GDP statistics.
235.543	According to the numbers, the music industry
237.655	is half the size that it was 10 years ago,
240.655	but I'm listening to more and better music than ever.
244.311	You know, I bet you are too.
246.503	In total, my research estimates
249.226	that the GDP numbers miss over 300 billion dollars per year
253.98	in free goods and services on the Internet.
257.326	Now let's look to the future.
259.115	There are some super smart people
261.378	who are arguing that we've reached the end of growth,
266.397	but to understand the future of growth,
269.955	we need to make predictions
272.638	about the underlying drivers of growth.
275.928	I'm optimistic, because the new machine age
279.734	is digital, exponential and combinatorial.
284.764	When goods are digital, they can be replicated
287.028	with perfect quality at nearly zero cost,
291.537	and they can be delivered almost instantaneously.
295.555	Welcome to the economics of abundance.
298.355	But there's a subtler benefit to the digitization of the world.
302.045	Measurement is the lifeblood of science and progress.
306.645	In the age of big data,
308.793	we can measure the world in ways we never could before.
313.079	Secondly, the new machine age is exponential.
317.174	Computers get better faster than anything else ever.
323.109	A child's Playstation today is more powerful
326.677	than a military supercomputer from 1996.
330.733	But our brains are wired for a linear world.
333.94	As a result, exponential trends take us by surprise.
337.828	I used to teach my students that there are some things,
340.43	you know, computers just aren't good at,
342.364	like driving a car through traffic.
344.749	(Laughter)
346.762	That's right, here's Andy and me grinning like madmen
350.253	because we just rode down Route 101
352.637	in, yes, a driverless car.
356.306	Thirdly, the new machine age is combinatorial.
358.889	The stagnationist view is that ideas get used up,
362.937	like low-hanging fruit,
364.793	but the reality is that each innovation
367.956	creates building blocks for even more innovations.
371.212	Here's an example. In just a matter of a few weeks,
374.557	an undergraduate student of mine
376.629	built an app that ultimately reached 1.3 million users.
380.74	He was able to do that so easily
382.439	because he built it on top of Facebook,
384.266	and Facebook was built on top of the web,
386.199	and that was built on top of the Internet,
387.897	and so on and so forth.
390.315	Now individually, digital, exponential and combinatorial
395.08	would each be game-changers.
397.43	Put them together, and we're seeing a wave
399.62	of astonishing breakthroughs,
401.013	like robots that do factory work or run as fast as a cheetah
404.073	or leap tall buildings in a single bound.
406.869	You know, robots are even revolutionizing
409.101	cat transportation.
410.93	(Laughter)
413.2	But perhaps the most important invention,
415.932	the most important invention is machine learning.
420.997	Consider one project: IBM's Watson.
424.373	These little dots here,
425.962	"those are all the champions on the quiz show ""Jeopardy."""
430.822	At first, Watson wasn't very good,
433.366	but it improved at a rate faster than any human could,
438.988	and shortly after Dave Ferrucci showed this chart
441.675	to my class at MIT,
443.327	"Watson beat the world ""Jeopardy"" champion."
446.869	At age seven, Watson is still kind of in its childhood.
450.858	Recently, its teachers let it surf the Internet unsupervised.
456.176	The next day, it started answering questions with profanities.
462.122	Damn. (Laughter)
464.396	But you know, Watson is growing up fast.
466.676	It's being tested for jobs in call centers, and it's getting them.
470.888	It's applying for legal, banking and medical jobs,
474.612	and getting some of them.
476.562	Isn't it ironic that at the very moment
478.451	we are building intelligent machines,
480.685	perhaps the most important invention in human history,
484.134	some people are arguing that innovation is stagnating?
488.109	Like the first two industrial revolutions,
490.528	the full implications of the new machine age
493.662	are going to take at least a century to fully play out,
496.344	but they are staggering.
499.376	So does that mean we have nothing to worry about?
502.712	No. Technology is not destiny.
506.392	Productivity is at an all time high,
508.961	but fewer people now have jobs.
511.944	We have created more wealth in the past decade than ever,
515.064	but for a majority of Americans, their income has fallen.
518.968	This is the great decoupling
521.28	of productivity from employment,
524.256	of wealth from work.
527.36	You know, it's not surprising that millions of people
529.706	have become disillusioned by the great decoupling,
532.552	but like too many others,
534.299	they misunderstand its basic causes.
537.396	Technology is racing ahead,
540.006	but it's leaving more and more people behind.
543.556	Today, we can take a routine job,
547.075	codify it in a set of machine-readable instructions,
550.166	and then replicate it a million times.
552.993	You know, I recently overheard a conversation
555.272	that epitomizes these new economics.
557.224	"This guy says, ""Nah, I don't use H&amp;R Block anymore."
561.421	TurboTax does everything that my tax preparer did,
563.869	"but it's faster, cheaper and more accurate."""
568.427	How can a skilled worker
570.226	compete with a $39 piece of software?
573.235	She can't.
575.202	Today, millions of Americans do have faster,
577.982	cheaper, more accurate tax preparation,
580.369	and the founders of Intuit
581.855	have done very well for themselves.
584.348	But 17 percent of tax preparers no longer have jobs.
588.562	That is a microcosm of what's happening,
590.64	not just in software and services, but in media and music,
595.317	in finance and manufacturing, in retailing and trade --
599.003	in short, in every industry.
602.898	People are racing against the machine,
605.993	and many of them are losing that race.
609.083	What can we do to create shared prosperity?
612.969	The answer is not to try to slow down technology.
615.986	Instead of racing against the machine,
618.543	we need to learn to race with the machine.
622.22	That is our grand challenge.
625.349	The new machine age
627.673	can be dated to a day 15 years ago
630.786	when Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion,
633.664	played Deep Blue, a supercomputer.
637.37	The machine won that day,
639.382	and today, a chess program running on a cell phone
642.35	can beat a human grandmaster.
644.646	It got so bad that, when he was asked
648.011	what strategy he would use against a computer,
650.574	Jan Donner, the Dutch grandmaster, replied,
654.59	"""I'd bring a hammer."""
656.361	(Laughter)
660.041	But today a computer is no longer the world chess champion.
664.585	Neither is a human,
667.239	because Kasparov organized a freestyle tournament
670.818	where teams of humans and computers
672.734	could work together,
674.833	and the winning team had no grandmaster,
677.99	and it had no supercomputer.
680.455	What they had was better teamwork,
684.63	and they showed that a team of humans and computers,
689.646	working together, could beat any computer
692.694	or any human working alone.
696.214	Racing with the machine
697.878	beats racing against the machine.
700.221	Technology is not destiny.
702.785	We shape our destiny.
704.527	Thank you.
705.974	(Applause)
