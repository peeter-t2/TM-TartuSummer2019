16.42	There's a beautiful statement
16.42	on the screen that says,
19.94	"""Light creates ambiance,"
19.94	light makes the feel of a space,
25.34	and light is also
25.34	"the expression of structure."""
28.42	Well, that was not by me.
30.26	That was, of course, by Le Corbusier,
30.26	the famous architect.
34.62	And here you can see what he meant
34.62	in one of his beautiful buildings --
39.26	the chapel Notre Dame Du Haut
39.26	De Ronchamp --
43.46	where he creates this light that he could
43.46	only make because there's also dark.
49.02	And I think that is the quintessence
49.02	of this 18-minute talk --
54.94	that there is no good lighting
54.94	that is healthy and for our well-being
60.26	without proper darkness.
64.5	So this is how we normally
64.5	would light our offices.
67.9	We have codes and standards that tell us
67.9	that the lights should be so much Lux
72.82	and of great uniformity.
75.1	This is how we create uniform lighting
75.1	from one wall to the other
80.139	in a regular grid of lamps.
82.94	And that is quite different
82.94	from what I just showed you
86.22	from Le Corbusier.
88.94	If we would apply
88.94	these codes and standards
91.02	to the Pantheon in Rome,
92.58	it would never have looked like this,
94.46	because this beautiful light feature
94.46	that goes around there all by itself
100.18	can only appear because there is
100.18	also darkness in that same building.
104.1	And the same is more or less
104.1	what Santiago Calatrava said
108.82	"when he said, ""Light: I make it"
108.82	"in my buildings for comfort."""
113.62	And he didn't mean the comfort
113.62	of a five-course dinner
116.82	as opposed to a one-course meal,
118.78	but he really meant the comfort
120.5	of the quality of the building
120.5	for the people.
123.26	He meant that you can see the sky
123.26	and that you can experience the sun.
128.74	And he created these gorgeous buildings
128.74	where you can see the sky,
133.26	and where you can experience the sun,
135.38	that give us a better life
135.38	in the built environment,
139.3	just because of the relevance of light
139.3	in its brightness and also in its shadows.
145.34	And what it all boils down to is,
145.34	of course, the sun.
149.3	And this image of the Sun may suggest
152.26	that the Sun is something
152.26	evil and aggressive,
154.46	but we should not forget
155.66	that all energy on this planet
155.66	actually comes from the Sun,
159.26	and light is only
159.26	a manifestation of that energy.
164.98	The sun is for dynamics,
164.98	for color changes.
168.42	The sun is for beauty in our environment,
171.02	like in this building --
171.02	the High Museum in Atlanta,
174.26	which has been created
174.26	by Renzo Piano from Italy,
177.22	together with Arup Lighting,
177.22	a brilliant team of lighting designers,
181.82	who created a very subtle
181.82	modulation of light across the space,
188.3	responding to what the sun does outside,
190.642	just because of all these
190.642	beautiful openings in the roof.
193.66	So in an indirect way,
193.66	you can see the sun.
197.86	And what they did is they created
197.86	an integral building element
201.34	to improve the quality of the space
201.34	that surrounds the visitors of the museum.
207.14	They created this shade
207.14	that you can see here,
210.42	which actually covers the sun,
214.1	but opens up to the good
214.1	light from the sky.
217.14	And here you can see how they really
217.14	crafted a beautiful design process
221.1	with physical models,
222.34	with quantitative
222.34	as well as qualitative methods,
225.62	to come to a final solution
225.62	that is truly integrated
229.86	and completely holistic
229.86	with the architecture.
232.42	They allowed themselves
232.42	a few mistakes along the way.
234.94	As you can see here,
234.94	there's some direct light on the floor,
237.82	but they could easily figure out
237.82	where that comes from.
240.46	And they allow people in that building
240.46	to really enjoy the sun,
246.06	the good part of the sun.
248.18	And enjoying the sun
248.18	can be in many different ways, of course.
252.62	It can be just like this,
254.46	or maybe like this,
254.46	which is rather peculiar,
257.904	but this is in 1963 --
260.02	the viewing of a sun eclipse
260.02	in the United States.
264.06	And it's just a bit bright up there,
266.34	so these people have found
266.34	a very intriguing solution.
270.18	This is, I think, a very illustrative
270.18	image of what I try to say --
273.38	that the beautiful dynamics of sun,
273.38	bringing these into the building,
278.3	creates a quality of our built environment
278.3	that truly enhances our lives.
282.86	And this is all about darkness
285.18	as much as it is
285.18	about lightness, of course,
287.3	because otherwise
287.3	you don't see these dynamics.
289.94	As opposed to the first office
291.42	that I showed you
291.42	in the beginning of the talk,
294.5	this is a well-known office,
294.5	which is the Weidt Group.
297.58	They are in green energy consulting,
297.58	or something like that.
300.66	And they really practice what they preach
302.637	because this office doesn't have
302.637	any electric lighting at all.
305.58	It has only, on one side,
305.58	this big, big glass window
309.86	that helps to let the sunlight
309.86	enter deep into the space
313.46	and create a beautiful quality there
313.46	and a great dynamic range.
316.9	So it can be very dim over there,
316.9	and you do your work,
319.54	and it can be very bright over there,
319.54	and you do your work.
322.34	But actually, the human eye
322.34	turns out to be remarkably adaptable
326.26	to all these different light conditions
326.26	that together create an environment
330.18	that is never boring
330.18	and that is never dull,
332.62	and therefore helps us
332.62	to enhance our lives.
336.66	I really owe a short introduction
336.66	of this man to you.
339.98	This is Richard Kelly
339.98	who was born 100 years ago,
343.94	which is the reason I bring him up now,
343.94	because it's kind of an anniversary year.
347.78	In the 1930s, Richard Kelly
347.78	was the first person to really describe
352.9	a methodology of modern lighting design.
354.86	And he coined three terms,
356.7	"which are ""focal glow,"""
356.7	"""ambient luminescence"""
360.62	"and ""play of the brilliants"" --"
362.3	three very distinctly different
362.3	ideas about light in architecture
366.82	that all together
366.82	make up this beautiful experience.
370.82	So to begin with, focal glow.
372.26	He meant something like this --
373.86	where the light
373.86	gives direction to the space
376.26	and helps you to get around.
378.26	Or something like this,
379.5	which is the lighting design
379.5	he did for General Motors,
382.14	for the car showroom.
383.38	And you enter that space,
384.62	and you feel like,
384.62	"""Wow! This is so impressive,"""
387.94	just because of this focal point,
387.94	this huge light source in the middle.
392.02	To me, it is something from theater,
393.759	and I will get back to that
393.759	a little bit later.
395.98	It's the spotlight on the artist
395.98	that helps you to focus.
399.66	It could also be the sunlight
399.66	that breaks through the clouds
402.5	and lights up a patch of the land,
405.94	highlighting it
405.94	compared to the dim environment.
410.38	Or it can be in today's retail,
410.38	in the shopping environment --
414.18	lighting the merchandise and creating
414.18	accents that help you to get around.
418.22	Ambient luminescence
418.22	is something very different.
421.26	Richard Kelly saw it
421.26	as something infinite,
424.38	something without any focus,
426.7	something where all details
426.7	actually dissolve in infinity.
431.54	And I see it as a very comfortable kind
431.54	of light that really helps us to relax
437.46	and to contemplate.
438.9	It could also be something like this:
440.74	the National Museum of Science in London,
442.86	where this blue is embracing
442.86	all the exhibitions and galleries
447.98	in one large gesture.
450.5	And then finally,
451.74	Kelly's play of brilliants added to that
454.22	really some play, I think,
454.22	of the skyline of Hong Kong,
457.58	or perhaps the chandelier
457.58	in the opera house,
459.94	or in the theater here,
461.58	which is the decoration,
461.58	the icing on the cake, something playful,
465.78	something that is just an addition
465.78	to the architectural environment,
469.34	I would say.
470.58	These three distinct elements, together,
473.18	make a lighting environment
473.18	that helps us to feel better.
476.94	And we can only
476.94	create these out of darkness.
479.1	And I will explain that further.
480.7	And I guess that is something
480.7	that Richard Kelly, here on the left,
483.9	was explaining
483.9	to Ludwig Mies van Der Rohe.
486.26	And behind them,
486.26	you see that Seagram Building
489.02	that later turned into an icon
489.02	of modern lighting design.
494.26	Those times, there were
494.26	some early attempts
497.069	also for light therapy already.
498.58	You can see here a photo
499.78	from the United States
499.78	Library of Medicine,
501.94	where people are put
501.94	in the sun to get better.
505.06	It's a little bit of a different story,
505.06	this health aspect of light,
508.275	than what I'm telling you today.
510.62	In today's modern medicine,
513.02	there is a real understanding of light
513.02	in an almost biochemical way.
518.54	And there is the idea
518.54	that, when we look at things,
523.26	it is the yellow light
523.26	that helps us the most,
525.46	that we are the most sensitive for.
527.46	But our circadian rhythms,
530.1	which are the rhythms
530.1	that help us to wake and sleep
532.58	and be alert and relaxed
532.58	and so forth and so on,
534.98	they are much more triggered
534.98	by blue light.
537.74	And by modulating the amount
537.74	of blue in our environment,
541.66	we can help people
541.66	to relax, or to be alert,
545.06	to fall asleep, or to stay awake.
547.38	And that is how, maybe in the near future,
547.38	light can help hospitals
553.42	to make people better sooner,
553.42	recover them quicker.
558.86	Maybe in the airplane,
558.86	we can overcome jet lag like that.
562.26	Perhaps in school,
562.26	we can help children to learn better
566.066	because they concentrate more
566.066	on their work.
568.138	And you can imagine
568.138	a lot more applications.
570.66	But I would like to talk further
572.26	about the combination
572.26	of light and darkness
578.06	as a quality in our life.
581.26	So light is, of course,
581.26	for social interaction also --
585.18	to create relationships
585.18	with all the features around us.
588.86	It is the place where we gather around
591.26	when we have to say something
591.26	to each other.
593.54	And it is all about this planet.
595.74	But when you look at this planet at night,
598.02	it looks like this.
599.38	And I think this is the most shocking
599.38	image in my talk today.
602.94	Because all this light here
602.94	goes up to the sky.
606.58	It never reaches the ground
606.58	where it was meant for.
610.5	It never is to the benefit of people.
612.66	It only spoils the darkness.
614.5	So at a global scale, it looks like this.
617.74	And, I mean, that is quite amazing,
617.74	what you see here --
620.5	how much light goes up into the sky
620.5	and never reaches the ground.
625.86	Because if we look at the Earth
625.86	the way it should be,
628.62	it would be something
628.62	like this very inspiring image
631.66	where darkness is for our imagination
631.66	and for contemplation
635.98	and to help us to relate to everything.
639.54	The world is changing though,
640.98	and urbanization
640.98	is a big driver of everything.
643.22	I took this photo
643.22	two weeks ago in Guangzhou,
645.662	and I realized that 10 years ago,
647.341	there was nothing like this,
647.341	of these buildings.
651.98	It was just a much smaller city,
654.1	and the pace of urbanization
654.1	is incredible and enormous.
657.58	And we have to understand
657.58	these main questions:
660.62	How do people move
660.62	through these new urban spaces?
664.26	How do they share their culture?
665.86	How do we tackle things like mobility?
668.26	And how can light help there?
670.18	Because the new technologies,
671.66	they seem to be
671.66	in a really interesting position
674.14	to contribute to the solutions
674.14	of urbanization
678.02	and to provide us
678.02	with better environments.
681.38	It's not that long ago
682.78	that our lighting was just done
682.78	with these kinds of lamps.
686.54	And of course,
686.54	we had the metal-halide lamps
688.66	and fluorescent lamps
688.66	and things like that.
690.78	Now we have LED,
692.3	but here you see the latest one,
692.3	and you see how incredibly small it is.
696.38	And this is exactly
696.38	what offers us a unique opportunity,
700.02	because this tiny, tiny size allows us
703.26	to put the light
703.26	wherever we really need it.
705.62	And we can actually leave it out
705.62	where it's not needed at all
708.54	and where we can preserve darkness.
710.26	So that is a really interesting
710.26	proposition, I think,
712.78	and a new way of lighting
712.78	the architectural environment
716.38	with our well-being in mind.
718.86	The problem is, though, that I wanted
718.86	to explain to you how this really works --
722.66	but I can have four of these on my finger,
725.1	so you would not be able
725.1	to really see them.
727.22	So I asked our laboratory
727.22	to do something about it,
730.3	and they said,
730.3	"""Well, we can do something."""
732.34	They created for me
732.34	the biggest LED in the world
734.9	especially for TEDx in Amsterdam.
736.94	So here it is.
738.3	It's the same thing
738.3	as you can see over there --
740.74	just 200 times bigger.
742.38	And I will very quickly
742.38	show you how it works.
744.74	So just to explain.
747.62	Now, every LED that is made
747.62	these days gives blue light.
754.82	Now, this is not very pleasant
754.82	and comfortable.
758.06	And for that reason,
758.06	we cover the LED with a phosphor cap.
764.98	And the phosphor is excited by the blue
767.7	and makes the light white
767.7	and warm and pleasant.
770.82	And then when you add the lens to that,
773.18	you can bundle the light
773.18	and send it wherever you need it
776.9	without any need to spill any light
776.9	to the sky or anywhere else.
780.26	So you can preserve the darkness
780.26	and make the light.
783.58	I just wanted to show that to you
783.58	so you understand how this works.
788.7	(Applause)
789.74	Thank you.
790.952	(Applause)
792.04	We can go further.
793.26	So we have to rethink
793.26	the way we light our cities.
796.5	We have to think again
796.5	about light as a default solution.
801.26	Why are all these motorways
801.26	permanently lit?
803.7	Is it really needed?
804.94	Can we maybe be much more selective
806.66	and create better environments
806.66	that also benefit from darkness?
810.02	Can we be much more gentle with light?
812.26	Like here -- this is
812.26	a very low light level actually.
815.1	Can we engage people more
815.1	in the lighting projects that we create,
818.74	so they really want
818.74	to connect with it, like here?
821.34	Or can we create simply sculptures
823.224	that are very inspiring
823.224	to be in and to be around?
825.86	And can we preserve the darkness?
827.86	Because to find a place
827.86	like this today on Earth
830.123	is really very, very challenging.
833.7	And to find a starry sky like this
833.7	is even more difficult.
837.02	Even in the oceans,
837.02	we are creating a lot of light
840.02	that we could actually ban
841.5	also for animal life
841.5	to have a much greater well-being.
845.18	And it's known that migrating birds,
845.18	for example, get very disoriented
848.5	because of these offshore platforms.
850.58	And we discovered that
850.58	when we make those lights green,
853.38	the birds, they actually go the right way.
855.42	They are not disturbed anymore.
857.46	And it turns out once again
859.302	that spectral sensitivity
859.302	is very important here.
864.18	In all of these examples, I think,
866.66	we should start making
866.66	the light out of darkness,
869.58	and use the darkness as a canvas --
869.58	like the visual artists do,
873.5	like Edward Hopper in this painting.
875.78	I think that there is
875.78	a lot of suspense in this painting.
878.5	I think, when I see it,
878.5	I start to think, who are those people?
882.74	Where have they come from?
882.74	Where are they going?
885.02	What just happened?
886.26	What will be happening
886.26	in the next five minutes?
888.54	And it only embodies
888.54	all these stories and all this suspense
891.42	because of the darkness and the light.
893.3	Edward Hopper was a real master
895.1	in creating the narration
895.1	by working with light and dark.
898.74	And we can learn from that
900.06	and create more interesting
900.06	and inspiring architectural environments.
903.86	We can do that in commercial
903.86	spaces like this.
906.34	And you can still also go outside
909.22	and enjoy the greatest show
909.22	in the universe,
914.06	which is, of course, the universe itself.
917.26	So I give you this wonderful,
917.26	informative image of the sky,
923.7	ranging from the inner city,
925.38	where you may see one or two stars
925.38	and nothing else,
929.1	all the way to the rural environments,
931.46	where you can enjoy this great
931.46	and gorgeous and beautiful performance
935.74	of the constellations and the stars.
938.14	In architecture, it works just the same.
940.9	By appreciating the darkness
940.9	when you design the light,
944.3	you create much more
944.3	interesting environments
946.9	that truly enhance our lives.
949.82	This is the most well-known example,
949.82	Tadao Ando's Church of the Light.
953.86	But I also think
953.86	of Peter Zumthor's spa in Vals,
959.5	where light and dark,
959.5	in very gentle combinations,
962.34	alter each other to define the space.
964.9	Or Richard MacCormac's
964.9	Southwark tube station in London,
968.22	where you can really see the sky,
968.22	even though you are under the ground.
972.42	And finally, I want to point out
974.14	that a lot of this inspiration
974.14	comes from theater.
976.66	And I think it's fantastic
976.66	that we are today experiencing TEDx
980.82	in a theater for the first time
983.34	because I think we really owe
983.34	to the theater a big thanks.
987.74	It wouldn't be
987.74	such an inspiring scenography
990.02	without this theater.
991.82	And I think the theater is a place
991.82	where we truly enhance life with light.
998.06	Thank you very much.
