25	What I'd like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world.
29	"I'm not going to talk about ""The Skeptical Environmentalist"" --"
31	probably that's also a good choice.
33	(Laughter)
34	But I am going talk about: what are the big problems in the world?
37	And I must say, before I go on, I should ask every one of you
40	to try and get out pen and paper
42	because I'm actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that.
45	So get out your pen and paper.
47	Bottom line is, there is a lot of problems out there in the world.
49	I'm just going to list some of them.
51	There are 800 million people starving.
53	There's a billion people without clean drinking water.
55	Two billion people without sanitation.
57	There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS.
60	The lists go on and on.
62	There's two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change -- so on.
67	There are many, many problems out there.
69	In an ideal world, we would solve them all, but we don't.
73	We don't actually solve all problems.
75	And if we do not, the question I think we need to ask ourselves --
79	and that's why it's on the economy session -- is to say,
82	if we don't do all things, we really have to start asking ourselves,
85	which ones should we solve first?
87	And that's the question I'd like to ask you.
89	If we had say, 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend
94	to do good in this world, where should we spend it?
97	We identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world,
100	and I will just briefly read them:
102	climate change, communicable diseases, conflicts, education,
104	financial instability, governance and corruption,
106	malnutrition and hunger, population migration,
109	sanitation and water, and subsidies and trade barriers.
112	We believe that these in many ways
114	encompass the biggest problems in the world.
116	The obvious question would be to ask,
118	what do you think are the biggest things?
120	Where should we start on solving these problems?
123	But that's a wrong problem to ask.
125	That was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January.
128	But of course, there's a problem in asking people to focus on problems.
131	Because we can't solve problems.
134	Surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die.
137	But we don't have a technology to solve that, right?
139	So the point is not to prioritize problems,
142	but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems.
146	And that would be -- of course that gets a little more complicated.
149	To climate change that would be like Kyoto.
151	To communicable diseases, it might be health clinics or mosquito nets.
154	To conflicts, it would be U.N.'s peacekeeping forces, and so on.
157	The point that I would like to ask you to try to do,
162	is just in 30 seconds -- and I know this is in a sense
165	an impossible task -- write down what you think
167	is probably some of the top priorities.
169	And also -- and that's, of course, where economics gets evil --
172	to put down what are the things we should not do, first.
175	What should be at the bottom of the list?
177	Please, just take 30 seconds, perhaps talk to your neighbor,
180	and just figure out what should be the top priorities
182	and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have
184	to the world's biggest issues.
186	The amazing part of this process -- and of course, I mean,
189	I would love to -- I only have 18 minutes,
191	I've already given you quite a substantial amount of my time, right?
193	I'd love to go into, and get you to think about this process,
197	and that's actually what we did.
199	And I also strongly encourage you,
201	and I'm sure we'll also have these discussions afterwards,
203	to think about, how do we actually prioritize?
205	Of course, you have to ask yourself,
207	why on Earth was such a list never done before?
209	And one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable.
214	Nobody wants to do this.
216	Of course, every organization would love to be on the top of such a list.
219	But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list.
222	And since there are many more not-number-one spots on the list
226	than there is number ones, it makes perfect sense
229	not to want to do such a list.
231	We've had the U.N. for almost 60 years,
233	yet we've never actually made a fundamental list
236	of all the big things that we can do in the world,
238	and said, which of them should we do first?
241	So it doesn't mean that we are not prioritizing --
244	any decision is a prioritization, so of course we are still prioritizing,
248	if only implicitly -- and that's unlikely to be as good
251	as if we actually did the prioritization,
253	and went in and talked about it.
255	So what I'm proposing is really to say that we have,
257	for a very long time, had a situation when we've had a menu of choices.
261	There are many, many things we can do out there,
263	but we've not had the prices, nor the sizes.
266	We have not had an idea.
268	Imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card,
271	but you have no idea what the price is.
273	You know, you have a pizza; you've no idea what the price is.
275	It could be at one dollar; it could be 1,000 dollars.
277	It could be a family-size pizza;
279	it could be a very individual-size pizza, right?
281	We'd like to know these things.
283	And that is what the Copenhagen Consensus is really trying to do --
285	to try to put prices on these issues.
288	And so basically, this has been the Copenhagen Consensus' process.
291	We got 30 of the world's best economists, three in each area.
295	So we have three of world's top economists write about climate change.
298	What can we do? What will be the cost
301	and what will be the benefit of that?
302	Likewise in communicable diseases.
304	Three of the world's top experts saying, what can we do?
307	What would be the price?
308	What should we do about it, and what will be the outcome?
311	And so on.
312	Then we had some of the world's top economists,
314	eight of the world's top economists, including three Nobel Laureates,
318	meet in Copenhagen in May 2004.
321	"We called them the ""dream team."""
323	The Cambridge University prefects decided to call them
326	the Real Madrid of economics.
328	That works very well in Europe, but it doesn't really work over here.
330	And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list.
334	And then you ask, why economists?
336	And of course, I'm very happy you asked that question -- (Laughter) --
338	because that's a very good question.
340	The point is, of course, if you want to know about malaria,
343	you ask a malaria expert.
345	If you want to know about climate, you ask a climatologist.
347	But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first,
350	you can't ask either of them, because that's not what they do.
353	That is what economists do.
355	They prioritize.
356	They make that in some ways disgusting task of saying, which one should we do first,
361	and which one should we do afterwards?
363	So this is the list, and this is the one I'd like to share with you.
366	Of course, you can also see it on the website,
368	and we'll also talk about it more, I'm sure, as the day goes on.
371	They basically came up with a list where they said
373	there were bad projects -- basically, projects
376	where if you invest a dollar, you get less than a dollar back.
379	Then there's fair projects, good projects and very good projects.
383	And of course, it's the very good projects we should start doing.
385	I'm going to go from backwards
387	so that we end up with the best projects.
389	These were the bad projects.
391	As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change.
395	This offends a lot of people, and that's probably one of the things
399	where people will say I shouldn't come back, either.
401	And I'd like to talk about that, because that's really curious.
403	Why is it it came up?
405	And I'll actually also try to get back to this
407	because it's probably one of the things
409	that we'll disagree with on the list that you wrote down.
411	The reason why they came up with saying that Kyoto --
414	or doing something more than Kyoto -- is a bad deal
416	is simply because it's very inefficient.
418	It's not saying that global warming is not happening.
420	It's not saying that it's not a big problem.
422	But it's saying that what we can do about it
424	is very little, at a very high cost.
427	What they basically show us, the average of all macroeconomic models,
431	is that Kyoto, if everyone agreed, would cost about 150 billion dollars a year.
436	That's a substantial amount of money.
438	That's two to three times the global development aid
440	that we give the Third World every year.
442	Yet it would do very little good.
444	All models show it will postpone warming for about six years in 2100.
448	So the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106.
452	Which is a little good, but not very much good.
454	So the idea here really is to say, well, we've spent a lot of money doing a little good.
459	And just to give you a sense of reference,
461	the U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount,
463	for about 75 billion dollars a year,
465	we could solve all major basic problems in the world.
468	We could give clean drinking water, sanitation, basic healthcare
471	and education to every single human being on the planet.
474	So we have to ask ourselves, do we want to spend twice the amount
478	on doing very little good?
479	Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good?
482	And that is really why it becomes a bad project.
485	It's not to say that if we had all the money in the world, we wouldn't want to do it.
488	But it's to say, when we don't, it's just simply not our first priority.
492	The fair projects -- notice I'm not going to comment on all these --
495	but communicable diseases, scale of basic health services -- just made it,
499	simply because, yes, scale of basic health services is a great thing.
502	It would do a lot of good, but it's also very, very costly.
505	Again, what it tells us is suddenly
507	we start thinking about both sides of the equation.
509	If you look at the good projects, a lot of sanitation and water projects came in.
513	Again, sanitation and water is incredibly important,
515	but it also costs a lot of infrastructure.
518	So I'd like to show you the top four priorities
520	which should be at least the first ones that we deal with
523	when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world.
526	The fourth best problem is malaria -- dealing with malaria.
530	The incidence of malaria is about a couple of [million] people get infected every year.
534	It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP
538	every year for affected nations.
540	If we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years,
544	we could bring that incidence down to half.
546	We could avoid about 500,000 people dying,
549	but perhaps more importantly, we could avoid about a [million] people
552	getting infected every year.
553	We would significantly increase their ability
555	to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with --
558	of course, in the long run, also to deal with global warming.
562	This third best one was free trade.
565	Basically, the model showed that if we could get free trade,
568	and especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe,
571	we could basically enliven the global economy
575	to an astounding number of about 2,400 billion dollars a year,
579	half of which would accrue to the Third World.
581	Again, the point is to say that we could actually pull
584	two to three hundred million people out of poverty,
587	very radically fast, in about two to five years.
590	That would be the third best thing we could do.
592	The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition.
596	Not just malnutrition in general, but there's a very cheap way
599	of dealing with malnutrition, namely, the lack of micronutrients.
602	Basically, about half of the world's population is lacking in
605	iron, zinc, iodine and vitamin A.
607	If we invest about 12 billion dollars,
609	we could make a severe inroad into that problem.
612	That would be the second best investment that we could do.
615	And the very best project would be to focus on HIV/AIDS.
620	Basically, if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years,
624	we could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV/AIDS.
628	Again, what this does and what it focuses on is saying
632	there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV/AIDS.
635	One is treatment; the other one is prevention.
638	And again, in an ideal world, we would do both.
641	But in a world where we don't do either, or don't do it very well,
644	we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first.
648	And treatment is much, much more expensive than prevention.
651	So basically, what this focuses on is saying, we can do a lot more
655	by investing in prevention.
657	Basically for the amount of money that we spend,
659	we can do X amount of good in treatment,
662	and 10 times as much good in prevention.
665	So again, what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment,
668	at first rate.
669	What this really does is that it makes us think about our priorities.
673	I'd like to have you look at your priority list and say,
677	did you get it right?
679	Or did you get close to what we came up with here?
681	Well, of course, one of the things is climate change again.
685	I find a lot of people find it very, very unlikely that we should do that.
688	We should also do climate change,
690	if for no other reason, simply because it's such a big problem.
693	But of course, we don't do all problems.
696	There are many problems out there in the world.
698	And what I want to make sure of is, if we actually focus on problems,
702	that we focus on the right ones.
704	The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good.
707	And I think, actually -- Thomas Schelling,
710	one of the participants in the dream team, he put it very, very well.
714	One of things that people forget, is that in 100 years,
717	when we're talking about most of the climate change impacts will be,
720	people will be much, much richer.
722	Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N.
726	estimate that the average person in the developing world in 2100
729	will be about as rich as we are today.
731	Much more likely, they will be two to four times richer than we are.
735	And of course, we'll be even richer than that.
737	But the point is to say, when we talk about saving people,
741	or helping people in Bangladesh in 2100,
744	we're not talking about a poor Bangladeshi.
746	We're actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy.
748	And so the real point, of course, is to say,
750	do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little,
756	Or do we want to help real poor people, right now, in Bangladesh,
761	who really need the help, and whom we can help very, very cheaply?
764	Or as Schelling put it, imagine if you were a rich -- as you will be --
769	a rich Chinese, a rich Bolivian, a rich Congolese, in 2100,
774	"thinking back on 2005, and saying, ""How odd that they cared so much"
780	about helping me a little bit through climate change,
784	and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather
788	and my great grandfather, whom they could have helped so much more,
791	"and who needed the help so much more?"""
794	So I think that really does tell us why it is
797	we need to get our priorities straight.
799	Even if it doesn't accord to the typical way we see this problem.
802	Of course, that's mainly because climate change has good pictures.
807	"We have, you know, ""The Day After Tomorrow"" -- it looks great, right?"
810	It's a good film in the sense that
813	I certainly want to see it, right, but don't expect Emmerich
816	to cast Brad Pitt in his next movie
819	digging latrines in Tanzania or something. (Laughter)
821	It just doesn't make for as much of a movie.
823	So in many ways, I think of the Copenhagen Consensus
825	and the whole discussion of priorities
827	as a defense for boring problems.
830	To make sure that we realize it's not about making us feel good.
834	It's not about making things that have the most media attention,
839	but it's about making places where we can actually do the most good.
842	The other objections, I think, that are important to say,
845	is that I'm somehow -- or we are somehow -- positing a false choice.
849	Of course, we should do all things,
851	in an ideal world -- I would certainly agree.
853	I think we should do all things, but we don't.
855	In 1970, the developed world decided we were going to spend
859	twice as much as we did, right now, than in 1970, on the developing world.
865	Since then our aid has halved.
867	So it doesn't look like we're actually on the path
870	of suddenly solving all big problems.
872	Likewise, people are also saying, but what about the Iraq war?
875	You know, we spend 100 billion dollars --
877	why don't we spend that on doing good in the world?
879	I'm all for that.
880	If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that, that's fine.
882	But the point, of course, is still to say,
884	if you get another 100 billion dollars,
886	we still want to spend that in the best possible way, don't we?
889	So the real issue here is to get ourselves back
891	and think about what are the right priorities.
893	I should just mention briefly, is this really the right list that we got out?
897	You know, when you ask the world's best economists,
900	you inevitably end up asking old, white American men.
903	And they're not necessarily, you know,
905	great ways of looking at the entire world.
909	So we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world
911	to come and solve the same problem.
913	The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university,
917	and they spoke English.
919	The majority of them were, first, from developing countries.
922	They had all the same material but they could go vastly
924	outside the scope of discussion, and they certainly did,
927	to come up with their own lists.
929	And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar --
931	with malnutrition and diseases at the top
934	and climate change at the bottom.
936	We've done this many other times.
937	There's been many other seminars and university students, and different things.
940	They all come out with very much the same list.
943	And that gives me great hope, really, in saying that I do believe
947	that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities,
952	and saying, what is the important thing in the world?
954	Of course, in an ideal world, again we'd love to do everything.
957	But if we don't do it, then we can start thinking about where should we start?
961	I see the Copenhagen Consensus as a process.
963	We did it in 2004,
965	and we hope to assemble many more people,
966	getting much better information for 2008, 2012.
970	Map out the right path for the world --
972	but also to start thinking about political triage.
975	"To start thinking about saying, ""Let's do"
977	not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost,
980	not the things that we don't know how to do,
982	but let's do the great things where we can do an enormous
985	"amount of good, at very low cost, right now."""
989	At the end of the day, you can disagree
991	with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these,
993	but we have to be honest and frank about saying,
996	if there's some things we do, there are other things we don't do.
999	If we worry too much about some things,
1001	we end by not worrying about other things.
1003	So I hope this will help us make better priorities,
1005	and think about how we better work for the world.
1007	Thank you.
