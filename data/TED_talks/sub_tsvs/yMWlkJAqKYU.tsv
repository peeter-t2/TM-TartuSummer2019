12.793	What do you do when you have a headache?
15.832	You swallow an aspirin.
18.247	But for this pill to get
18.247	to your head, where the pain is,
22.594	it goes through your stomach, intestines
22.594	and various other organs first.
28.947	Swallowing pills is the most effective
28.947	and painless way of delivering
34.093	any medication in the body.
37.452	The downside, though, is that swallowing
37.452	any medication leads to its dilution.
43.134	And this is a big problem,
43.134	particularly in HIV patients.
48.783	When they take their anti-HIV drugs,
51.96	these drugs are good for lowering
51.96	the virus in the blood,
56.05	and increasing the CD4 cell counts.
58.618	But they are also notorious
58.618	for their adverse side effects,
63.007	but mostly bad, because they get diluted
63.007	by the time they get to the blood,
68.524	and worse, by the time
68.524	they get to the sites
71.425	where it matters most:
71.425	within the HIV viral reservoirs.
77.751	These areas in the body --
77.751	such as the lymph nodes,
82.298	the nervous system,
82.298	as well as the lungs --
85.207	where the virus is sleeping,
87.735	and will not readily
87.735	get delivered in the blood
90.967	of patients that are under
90.967	consistent anti-HIV drugs therapy.
96.502	However, upon discontinuation of therapy,
100.212	the virus can awake
100.212	and infect new cells in the blood.
104.728	Now, all this is a big problem in treating
104.728	HIV with the current drug treatment,
111.337	which is a life-long treatment
111.337	that must be swallowed by patients.
115.395	One day, I sat and thought,
117.79	"""Can we deliver anti-HIV directly"
117.79	within its reservoir sites,
123.551	"without the risk of drug dilution?"""
126.525	As a laser scientist,
126.525	the answer was just before my eyes:
131.142	Lasers, of course.
132.976	If they can be used for dentistry,
135.864	for diabetic wound-healing and surgery,
138.739	they can be used for anything imaginable,
141.468	including transporting drugs into cells.
145.403	As a matter of fact,
145.403	we are currently using laser pulses
150.657	to poke or drill extremely tiny holes,
154.31	which open and close almost
154.31	immediately in HIV-infected cells,
159.246	in order to deliver drugs within them.
162.38	"""How is that possible?"" you may ask."
165.119	Well, we shine a very powerful
165.119	but super-tiny laser beam
171.476	onto the membrane of HIV-infected cells
175.304	while these cells are immersed
175.304	in liquid containing the drug.
180.395	The laser pierces the cell,
180.395	while the cell swallows the drug
185.277	in a matter of microseconds.
187.446	Before you even know it,
189.042	the induced hole
189.042	becomes immediately repaired.
193.246	Now, we are currently testing
193.246	this technology in test tubes
197.69	or in Petri dishes,
199.221	but the goal is to get
199.221	this technology in the human body,
203.581	apply it in the human body.
205.928	"""How is that possible?"" you may ask."
208.422	Well, the answer is:
208.422	through a three-headed device.
213.506	Using the first head, which is our laser,
216.452	we will make an incision
216.452	in the site of infection.
220.498	Using the second head, which is a camera,
223.15	we meander to the site of infection.
225.813	Finally, using a third head,
225.813	which is a drug-spreading sprinkler,
230.604	we deliver the drugs directly
230.604	at the site of infection,
233.635	while the laser is again used
233.635	to poke those cells open.
238.815	Well, this might not seem
238.815	like much right now.
242.68	But one day, if successful,
242.68	this technology can lead
247.767	to complete eradication
247.767	of HIV in the body.
251.401	Yes. A cure for HIV.
254.147	This is every HIV researcher's dream --
257.085	in our case, a cure lead by lasers.
260.636	Thank you.
261.813	(Applause)
