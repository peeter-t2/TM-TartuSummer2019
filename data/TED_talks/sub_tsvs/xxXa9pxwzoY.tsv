25	In the next 18 minutes, I'm going to take you on a journey.
28	And it's a journey that you and I have been on for many years now,
33	and it began some 50 years ago, when humans first stepped off our planet.
39	And in those 50 years, not only did we literally, physically set foot on the moon,
46	but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets -- all eight of them --
53	and we have landed on asteroids, we have rendezvoused with comets,
57	and, at this point in time, we have a spacecraft on its way to Pluto,
62	the body formerly known as a planet.
65	And all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey:
71	a voyage to understand something, to get a sense of our cosmic place,
78	to understand something of our origins, and how Earth, our planet,
83	and we, living on it, came to be.
85	And of all the places in the solar system that we might go to
88	and search for answers to questions like this,
92	there's Saturn. And we have been to Saturn before --
95	we visited Saturn in the early 1980s --
98	but our investigations of Saturn have become far more in-depth in detail
103	since the Cassini spacecraft, traveling across interplanetary space
107	for seven years, glided into orbit around Saturn in the summer of 2004,
113	and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost
116	that humanity had ever established around the Sun.
119	Now, the Saturn system is a rich planetary system.
124	It offers mystery, scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare,
131	and the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach.
135	In fact, just studying the rings alone, we stand to learn a lot
139	about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies.
144	And here's a beautiful picture of the Andromeda Nebula,
146	which is our closest, largest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way.
150	And then, here's a beautiful composite of the Whirlpool Galaxy,
153	taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.
155	So the journey back to Saturn is really part of and is also a metaphor
161	for a much larger human voyage
163	to understand the interconnectedness of everything around us,
167	and also how humans fit into that picture.
170	And it pains me that I can't tell you all that we have learned with Cassini.
177	I can't show you all the beautiful pictures that we've taken
180	in the last two and a half years, because I simply don't have the time.
183	So I'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories
187	that have emerged out of this major exploratory expedition
191	that we are conducting around Saturn,
193	and have been for the past two and a half years.
196	Saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons.
200	They range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the U.S.
205	Most of the beautiful pictures we've taken of Saturn, in fact,
208	show Saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons. Here's Saturn with Dione,
213	and then, here's Saturn showing the rings edge-on,
216	showing you just how vertically thin they are, with the moon Enceladus.
220	Now, two of the 47 moons that Saturn has are standouts.
225	And those are Titan and Enceladus. Titan is Saturn's largest moon,
230	and, until Cassini had arrived there,
232	was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain
236	that we had remaining in our solar system.
240	And it is a body that has long intrigued people who've watched the planets.
244	It has a very large, thick atmosphere,
248	and in fact, its surface environment was believed to be
252	more like the environment we have here on the Earth,
256	or at least had in the past, than any other body in the solar system.
260	Its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen, like you are breathing here in this room,
265	except that its atmosphere is suffused with
267	simple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane.
271	And these molecules high up in the atmosphere of Titan
274	get broken down, and their products join together to make haze particles.
279	This haze is ubiquitous. It's completely global and enveloping Titan.
284	And that's why you cannot see down to the surface
287	with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum.
289	But these haze particles, it was surmised,
292	before we got there with Cassini, over billions and billions of years,
296	gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface
300	in a thick organic sludge.
301	So like the equivalent, the Titan equivalent, of tar, or oil, or what -- we didn't know what.
308	But this is what we suspected. And these molecules,
310	especially methane and ethane, can be liquids at the surface temperatures of Titan.
319	And so it turns out that methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth.
324	It's a condensable in the atmosphere,
326	and so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore
331	a whole world of bizarre possibilities. You can have methane clouds, OK,
336	and above those clouds, you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze,
339	which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface.
341	The temperature at the surface is some 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
347	But despite that cold, you could have rain falling down on the surface of Titan.
353	And doing on Titan what rain does on the Earth: it carves gullies; it forms rivers
356	and cataracts; it can create canyons; it can pool in large basins and craters.
363	It can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills,
366	down into the lowlands. So stop and think for a minute.
369	Try to imagine what the surface of Titan might look like.
373	It's dark. High noon on Titan is as dark as deep earth twilight on the Earth.
378	It's cold, it's eerie, it's misty,
380	it might be raining, and you might be standing
383	on the shores of Lake Michigan brimming with paint thinner. (Laughter)
387	That is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini, 
392	and I can tell you that what we have found on Titan, though it is not the same in detail,
399	is every bit as fascinating as that story is.
402	And for us, it has been like -- the Cassini people --
404	it has been like a Jules Verne adventure come true.
408	As I said, it has a thick, extensive atmosphere.
410	This is a picture of Titan, backlit by the Sun, with the rings as a beautiful backdrop.
415	And yet another moon there --
417	I don't even know which one it is. It's a very extensive atmosphere.
420	We have instruments on Cassini which can see down to the surface
423	through this atmosphere, and my camera system is one of them.
427	And we have taken pictures like this.
429	And what you see is bright and dark regions, and that's about as far as it got for us.
434	It was so mystifying: we couldn't make out what we were seeing on Titan.
438	When you look closer at this region, you start to see things
443	like sinuous channels -- we didn't know. You see a few round things.
447	This, we later found out, is, in fact, a crater,
449	but there are very few craters on the surface of Titan,
452	meaning it's a very young surface.
454	And there are features that look tectonic.
456	They look like they've been pulled apart.
458	Whenever you see anything linear on a planet,
460	it means there's been a fracture, like a fault.
464	And so it's been tectonically altered.
466	But we couldn't make sense of our images,
468	until, six months after we got into orbit,
472	an event occurred that many have regarded
474	as the highlight of Cassini's investigation of Titan.
477	And that was the deployment of the Huygens probe,
480	the European-built Huygens probe that Cassini had carried
483	for seven years across the solar system. We deployed it to the atmosphere of Titan,
487	it took two and a half hours to descend, and it landed on the surface.
491	And I just want to emphasize how significant an event this is.
495	This is a device of human making,
498	and it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history.
502	It is so significant that, in my mind,
506	this was an event that should have been celebrated
508	with ticker tape parades in every city across the U.S. and Europe,
513	and sadly, that wasn't the case.
515	(Laughter).
517	It was significant for another reason. This is an international mission,
520	and this event was celebrated in Europe, in Germany,
523	and the celebratory presentations were given in English accents,
527	and American accents, and German accents, and French and Italian and Dutch accents.
533	It was a moving demonstration of what the words
537	"""united nations"" are supposed to mean:"
539	a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good.
545	And, in this case, it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet,
549	and to come to understand a planetary system
552	that, for all of human history, had been unreachable,
556	and now humans had actually touched it.
558	So it was -- I mean, I'm getting goose bumps just talking about it.
562	It was a tremendously emotional event,
564	and it's something that I will personally never forget, and you shouldn't either.
569	(Applause).
575	But anyway, the probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down,
578	and it also took panoramic pictures.
580	And I can't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures
584	of Titan's surface from the probe. And this is what we saw.
588	And it was a shocker, because it was everything we wanted
591	those other pictures taken from orbit to be.
593	It was an unambiguous pattern, a geological pattern.
597	It's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids.
602	And you can follow these channels
604	and you can see how they all converge.
605	And they converge into this channel here, which drains into this region.
609	You are looking at a shoreline.
611	Was this a shoreline of fluids? We didn't know.
614	But this is somewhat of a shoreline.
616	This picture is taken at 16 kilometers.
618	This is the picture taken at eight kilometers, OK? Again, the shoreline.
622	Okay, now, 16 kilometers, eight kilometers -- this is roughly an airline altitude.
627	If you were going to take an airplane trip across the U.S.,
630	you would be flying at these altitudes.
632	So, this is the picture you would have at the window of Titanian Airlines
636	as you fly across the surface of Titan. (Laughter)
639	And then finally, the probe came to rest on the surface,
643	and I'm going to show you, ladies and gentlemen,
645	the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system.
649	And here is the horizon, OK?
653	These are probably water ice pebbles, yes?
657	(Applause).
662	And obviously, it landed in one of these flat, dark regions
666	and it didn't sink out of sight. So it wasn't fluid that we landed in.
671	What the probe came down in was basically
674	the Titan equivalent of a mud flat.
677	This is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane.
682	And it's probably the case that this material
685	has washed off the highlands of Titan
689	through these channels that we saw,
690	and has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins.
694	And that is what the Huygens probe landed in.
697	But still, there was no sign in our images,
701	or even in the Huygens' images, of any large, open bodies of fluids.
706	Where were they? It got even more puzzling when we found dunes.
711	OK, so this is our movie of the equatorial region of Titan,
714	showing these dunes. These are dunes that are 100 meters tall,
717	separated by a few kilometers,
720	and they go on for miles and miles and miles.
723	There's hundreds, up to a 1,000 or 1,200 miles of dunes.
726	This is the Saharan desert of Titan.
729	It's obviously a place which is very dry, or you wouldn't get dunes.
734	So again, it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid,
739	until finally, we saw lakes in the polar regions.
743	And there is a lake scene in the south polar region of Titan.
747	It's about the size of Lake Ontario.
749	And then, only a week and a half ago,
750	we flew over the north pole of Titan and found, again,
754	we found a feature here the size of the Caspian Sea.
759	So it seems that the liquids, for some reason we don't understand,
763	or during at least this season, are apparently at the poles of Titan.
768	And I think you would agree that we have found Titan
771	is a remarkable, mystical place. It's exotic, it's alien, but yet strangely Earth-like,
778	and having Earth-like geological formations
781	and a tremendous geographical diversity,
785	and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system
789	for complexity and richness is the Earth itself.
792	And so now we go onto Enceladus. Enceladus is a small moon,
797	it's about a tenth the size of Titan. And you can see it here next to England,
801	just to show you the size. This is not meant to be a threat.
804	(Laughter).
806	And Enceladus is very white, it's very bright,
810	and its surface is obviously wrecked with fractures.
814	It is a very geologically active body.
816	But the mother lode of discoveries on Enceladus
818	was found at the south pole -- and we're looking at the south pole here --
821	where we found this system of fractures.
824	And they're a different color because they're a different composition.
826	They are coated. These fractures are coated with organic materials.
831	Moreover, this whole, entire region, the south polar region,
835	has elevated temperatures. It's the hottest place on the planet, on the body.
839	That's as bizarre as finding that the Antarctic on the Earth is hotter than the tropics.
844	And then, when we took additional pictures, we discovered
847	that from these fractures are issuing jets of fine, icy particles
853	extending hundreds of miles into space.
855	And when we color-code this image, to bring out the faint light levels,
858	we see that these jets feed a plume
862	that, in fact, we see, in other images, goes thousands of miles
866	into the space above Enceladus.
868	My team and I have examined images like this,
871	and like this one, and have thought about the other results from Cassini.
875	And we have arrived at the conclusion
879	that these jets may be erupting from pockets
882	of liquid water under the surface of Enceladus.
886	So we have, possibly, liquid water, organic materials and excess heat.
891	In other words, we have possibly stumbled upon
894	the holy grail of modern day planetary exploration,
898	or in other words, an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms.
902	And I don't think I need to tell you that the discovery of life
905	elsewhere in our solar system,
907	whether it be on Enceladus or elsewhere,
909	would have enormous cultural and scientific implications.
912	Because if we could demonstrate that genesis had occurred
916	not once, but twice, independently, in our solar system,
920	then that means, by inference, it has occurred a staggering number of times
924	throughout the universe and its 13.7 billion year history.
929	Right now, Earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life.
933	It is precious, it is unique,
936	it is still, so far, the only home we've ever known.
939	And if any of you were alert and coherent during the 1960s --
946	and we'd forgive you, if you weren't, OK --
948	you would remember this very famous picture
950	taken by the Apollo 8 astronauts in 1968.
954	It was the first time that Earth was imaged from space,
957	and it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe,
960	and our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet.
965	Well, we on Cassini have taken an equivalent first,
969	a picture that no human eye has ever seen before.
973	It is a total eclipse of the Sun, seen from the other side of Saturn.
977	And in this impossibly beautiful picture,
981	you see the main rings backlit by the Sun,
983	you see the refracted image of the Sun
986	and you see this ring created, in fact,
988	by the exhalations of Enceladus.
991	But as if that weren't brilliant enough, we can spot, in this beautiful image,
997	sight of our own planet,
999	cradled in the arms of Saturn's rings.
1003	Now, there is something deeply moving
1005	about seeing ourselves from afar,
1007	and capturing the sight of our little, blue-ocean planet
1010	in the skies of other worlds.
1012	And that, and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that,
1016	may be, in the end, the finest reward that we earn
1020	from this journey of discovery that started half a century ago.
1023	And thank you very much.
1025	(Applause)
