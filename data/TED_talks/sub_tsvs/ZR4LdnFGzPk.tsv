15.26	I'm going to make an argument today
17.26	that may seem a little bit crazy:
20.26	social media and the end of gender.
23.26	Let me connect the dots.
26.26	I'm going to argue today
28.26	that the social media applications
30.26	that we all know and love, or love to hate,
33.26	are actually going to help free us
35.26	from some of the absurd assumptions
37.26	that we have as a society about gender.
40.26	I think that social media
42.26	is actually going to help us dismantle
44.26	some of the silly and demeaning stereotypes
47.26	that we see in media and advertising
50.26	about gender.
52.26	If you hadn't noticed,
54.26	our media climate generally provides
56.26	a very distorted mirror
58.26	of our lives and of our gender,
60.26	and I think that's going to change.
62.26	Now most media companies --
64.26	television, radio, publishing, games, you name it --
67.26	they use very rigid segmentation methods
70.26	in order to understand their audiences.
72.26	It's old-school demographics.
74.26	They come up with these very restrictive labels to define us.
79.26	Now the crazy thing
81.26	is that media companies believe
83.26	that if you fall within a certain demographic category
86.26	then you are predictable in certain ways --
88.26	you have certain taste,
90.26	that you like certain things.
92.26	And so the bizarre result of this
94.26	is that most of our popular culture
96.26	is actually based on these presumptions
98.26	about our demographics.
101.26	Age demographics:
103.26	the 18 to 49 demo
105.26	has had a huge impact
107.26	on all mass media programming in this country
109.26	since the 1960s,
111.26	when the baby boomers were still young.
114.26	Now they've aged out of that demographic,
117.26	but it's still the case
119.26	that powerful ratings companies like Nielson
121.26	don't even take into account
123.26	viewers of television shows over age 54.
126.26	In our media environment,
128.26	it's as if they don't even exist.
130.26	"Now, if you watch ""Mad Men,"" like I do --"
132.26	it's a popular TV show in the States --
135.26	Dr. Faye Miller does something called psychographics,
138.26	which first came about in the 1960s,
141.26	where you create these complex psychological profiles
143.26	of consumers.
145.26	But psychographics really haven't had a huge impact on the media business.
148.26	It's really just been basic demographics.
152.26	So I'm at the Norman Lear Center at USC,
155.26	and we've done a lot of research over the last seven, eight years
158.26	on demographics
160.26	and how they affect media and entertainment
162.26	in this country and abroad.
164.26	And in the last three years,
166.26	we've been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed,
169.26	and we've discovered some very interesting things.
173.26	All the people who participate in social media networks
175.26	belong to the same old demographic categories
178.26	that media companies and advertisers
180.26	have used in order to understand them.
182.26	But those categories mean even less now
185.26	than they did before,
187.26	because with online networking tools,
189.26	it's much easier for us
191.26	to escape some of our demographic boxes.
193.26	We're able to connect with people quite freely
196.26	and to redefine ourselves online.
198.26	And we can lie about our age online, too, pretty easily.
202.26	We can also connect with people
205.26	based on our very specific interests.
207.26	We don't need a media company
209.26	to help do this for us.
211.26	So the traditional media companies, of course,
214.26	are paying very close attention to these online communities.
217.26	They know this is the mass audience of the future;
220.26	they need to figure it out.
222.26	But they're having a hard time doing it
224.26	because they're still trying to use demographics in order to understand them,
227.26	because that's how ad rates are still determined.
230.26	When they're monitoring your clickstream --
232.26	and you know they are --
234.26	they have a really hard time
236.26	figuring out your age, your gender and your income.
238.26	They can make some educated guesses.
240.26	But they get a lot more information
242.26	about what you do online,
244.26	what you like, what interests you.
246.26	That's easier for them to find out than who you are.
249.26	And even though that's still sort of creepy,
252.26	there is an upside
254.26	to having your taste monitored.
257.26	Suddenly our taste is being respected
259.26	in a way that it hasn't been before.
261.26	It had been presumed before.
264.26	So when you look online at the way people aggregate,
267.26	they don't aggregate
269.26	around age, gender and income.
271.26	They aggregate around the things they love,
273.26	the things that they like,
275.26	and if you think about it, shared interests and values
277.26	are a far more powerful aggregator of human beings
280.26	than demographic categories.
282.26	I'd much rather know
284.26	"whether you like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"""
287.26	rather than how old you are.
289.26	That would tell me something more substantial about you.
293.26	Now there's something else that we've discovered about social media
295.26	that's actually quite surprising.
297.26	It turns out that women
299.26	are really driving the social media revolution.
303.26	If you look at the statistics --
305.26	these are worldwide statistics --
307.26	in every single age category,
310.26	women actually outnumber men
312.26	in their use of social networking technologies.
316.26	And then if you look at the amount of time
318.26	that they spend on these sites,
320.26	they truly dominate the social media space,
323.26	which is a space that's having a huge impact
326.26	on old media.
328.26	The question is: what sort of impact
330.26	is this going to have on our culture,
333.26	and what's it going to mean for women?
335.26	If the case is that social media
337.26	is dominating old media
339.26	and women are dominating social media,
342.26	then does that mean that women
344.26	are going to take over global media?
346.26	Are we suddenly going to see
348.26	a lot more female characters in cartoons
350.26	and in games and on TV shows?
353.26	Will the next big-budget blockbuster movies
357.26	actually be chick flicks?
360.26	Could this be possible,
362.26	that suddenly our media landscape
364.26	will become a feminist landscape?
368.26	Well, I actually don't think that's going to be the case.
371.26	I think that media companies are going to hire a lot more women,
374.26	because they realize this is important for their business,
376.26	and I think that women
378.26	are also going to continue to dominate
380.26	the social media sphere.
382.26	But I think women are actually going to be -- ironically enough --
385.26	responsible for driving a stake through the heart
388.26	of cheesy genre categories
392.26	"like the ""chick flick"""
394.26	and all these other genre categories
396.26	that presume that certain demographic groups
399.26	like certain things --
401.26	that Hispanics like certain things,
403.26	that young people like certain things.
405.26	This is far too simplistic.
407.26	The future entertainment media that we're going to see
410.26	is going to be very data-driven,
412.26	and it's going to be based on the information
414.26	that we ascertain from taste communities online,
417.26	where women are really driving the action.
420.26	So you may be asking, well why is it important
423.26	that I know what entertains people?
425.26	Why should I know this?
427.26	Of course, old media companies and advertisers
429.26	need to know this.
431.26	But my argument is that,
433.26	if you want to understand the global village,
435.26	it's probably a good idea that you figure out
437.26	what they're passionate about, what amuses them,
440.26	what they choose to do in their free time.
443.26	This is a very important thing to know about people.
446.26	I've spent most of my professional life
449.26	researching media and entertainment
451.26	and its impact on people's lives.
453.26	And I do it not just because it's fun --
456.26	though actually, it is really fun --
458.26	but also because
460.26	our research has shown over and over again
462.26	that entertainment and play
464.26	have a huge impact on people's lives --
467.26	for instance, on their political beliefs
469.26	and on their health.
471.26	And so, if you have any interest in understanding the world,
474.26	looking at how people amuse themselves
476.26	is a really good way to start.
479.26	So imagine a media atmosphere
482.26	that isn't dominated by lame stereotypes
485.26	about gender
487.26	and other demographic characteristics.
489.26	Can you even imagine what that looks like?
491.26	I can't wait to find out what it looks like.
493.26	Thank you so much.
495.26	(Applause)
