16.278	On my desk in my office, I keep a small clay pot
20.582	that I made in college. It's raku, which is a kind of pottery
25.045	that began in Japan centuries ago as a way of
29.552	making bowls for the Japanese tea ceremony.
33.599	This one is more than 400 years old.
36.864	Each one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay,
41.328	and it was the imperfections that people cherished.
45.624	Everyday pots like this cup take eight to 10 hours to fire.
53.696	I just took this out of the kiln last week, and the kiln itself
56.805	takes another day or two to cool down, but raku
61.289	is really fast. You do it outside, and you take the kiln
66.092	up to temperature. In 15 minutes, it goes to 1,500 degrees,
70.647	and as soon as you see that the glaze has melted inside,
74.305	you can see that faint sheen, you turn the kiln off,
77.123	and you reach in with these long metal tongs,
79.71	you grab the pot, and in Japan, this red-hot pot
84.195	would be immediately immersed in a solution of green tea,
89.109	and you can imagine what that steam would smell like.
92.341	But here in the United States, we ramp up the drama
95.506	a little bit, and we drop our pots into sawdust,
99.171	which catches on fire, and you take a garbage pail,
102.195	and you put it on top, and smoke starts pouring out.
107.107	I would come home with my clothes reeking of woodsmoke.
111.987	I love raku because it allows me to play with the elements.
117.085	I can shape a pot out of clay and choose a glaze,
121.581	but then I have to let it go to the fire and the smoke,
125.885	and what's wonderful is the surprises that happen,
128.35	like this crackle pattern, because it's really stressful
131.623	on these pots. They go from 1,500 degrees
134.234	to room temperature in the space of just a minute.
138.313	Raku is a wonderful metaphor for the process of creativity.
144.264	I find in so many things that tension between
148.029	what I can control and what I have to let go
151.464	happens all the time, whether I'm creating a new radio show
155.258	or just at home negotiating with my teenage sons.
160.343	When I sat down to write a book about creativity,
164.317	I realized that the steps were reversed.
166.801	I had to let go at the very beginning, and I had to
170.45	immerse myself in the stories of hundreds of artists
175.054	and writers and musicians and filmmakers, and as I listened
179.529	to these stories, I realized that creativity
184.841	grows out of everyday experiences
188.169	more often than you might think, including
191.873	letting go.
194.793	It was supposed to break, but that's okay. (Laughter) (Laughs)
198.583	That's part of the letting go, is sometimes it happens
201.532	and sometimes it doesn't, because creativity also grows
204.937	from the broken places.
207.714	The best way to learn about anything
210.361	is through stories, and so I want to tell you a story
214.395	about work and play and about four aspects of life
219.577	that we need to embrace
221.973	in order for our own creativity to flourish.
226.041	The first embrace is something that we think,
228.057	"""Oh, this is very easy,"" but it's actually getting harder,"
232.263	and that's paying attention to the world around us.
236.258	So many artists speak about needing to be open,
240.713	to embrace experience, and that's hard to do when
244.153	you have a lighted rectangle in your pocket that
247.771	takes all of your focus.
251.358	The filmmaker Mira Nair speaks about growing up
255.498	in a small town in India. Its name is Bhubaneswar,
260.103	and here's a picture of one of the temples in her town.
263.796	Mira Nair: In this little town, there were like 2,000 temples.
266.668	We played cricket all the time. We kind of grew up
269.524	in the rubble. The major thing that inspired me,
272.78	that led me on this path, that made me a filmmaker eventually,
276.428	was traveling folk theater that would come through the town
279.98	and I would go off and see these great battles
283.292	of good and evil by two people in a school field
286.708	with no props but with a lot of, you know,
289.244	passion, and hashish as well, and it was amazing.
292.939	You know, the folk tales of Mahabharata and Ramayana,
295.733	the two holy books, the epics that everything comes out of
299.228	in India, they say. After seeing that Jatra, the folk theater,
302.758	I knew I wanted to get on, you know, and perform.
307.748	Julie Burstein: Isn't that a wonderful story?
309.655	You can see the sort of break in the everyday.
312.075	There they are in the school fields, but it's good and evil,
314.794	and passion and hashish. And Mira Nair was a young girl
320.327	with thousands of other people watching this performance,
323.925	but she was ready. She was ready to open up
326.875	to what it sparked in her, and it led her,
330.004	as she said, down this path to become
332.619	an award-winning filmmaker.
335.422	So being open for that experience that might change you
338.243	is the first thing we need to embrace.
341.176	Artists also speak about how some of their most powerful work
346.955	comes out of the parts of life that are most difficult.
351.827	The novelist Richard Ford speaks about
355.481	a childhood challenge that continues to be something
359.523	he wrestles with today. He's severely dyslexic.
364.283	Richard Ford: I was slow to learn to read, went all the way
367.19	through school not really reading more than the minimum,
371.022	and still to this day can't read silently
373.55	much faster than I can read aloud,
376.398	but there were a lot of benefits to being dyslexic for me
380.174	because when I finally did reconcile myself to how slow
383.319	I was going to have to do it, then I think I came very slowly
387.814	into an appreciation of all of those qualities of language
391.346	and of sentences that are not just the cognitive
394.158	aspects of language: the syncopations, the sounds of words,
397.271	what words look like, where paragraphs break,
399.114	where lines break. I mean, I wasn't so badly dyslexic that
402.141	I was disabled from reading. I just had to do it
405.079	really slowly, and as I did, lingering on those sentences
409.622	as I had to linger, I fell heir to language's other qualities,
413.982	which I think has helped me write sentences.
417.246	JB: It's so powerful. Richard Ford, who's won the Pulitzer Prize,
421.326	says that dyslexia helped him write sentences.
426.478	He had to embrace this challenge, and I use that word
429.249	intentionally. He didn't have to overcome dyslexia.
433.362	He had to learn from it. He had to learn to hear the music
436.87	in language.
439.934	Artists also speak about how pushing up against
444.504	the limits of what they can do, sometimes pushing
447.898	into what they can't do, helps them focus
451.246	on finding their own voice.
454.485	The sculptor Richard Serra talks about how,
458.63	as a young artist, he thought he was a painter,
461.55	and he lived in Florence after graduate school.
465.829	While he was there, he traveled to Madrid,
468.398	where he went to the Prado to see this picture
471.112	by the Spanish painter Diego Velázquez.
474.872	"It's from 1656, and it's called ""Las Meninas,"""
479.976	and it's the picture of a little princess
482.185	and her ladies-in-waiting, and if you look over
485.872	that little blonde princess's shoulder, you'll see a mirror,
489.248	and reflected in it are her parents, the King and Queen
492.545	of Spain, who would be standing where you might stand
495.95	to look at the picture.
497.725	As he often did, Velázquez put himself in this painting too.
502.792	He's standing on the left with his paintbrush in one hand
507.485	and his palette in the other.
509.889	Richard Serra: I was standing there looking at it,
511.917	and I realized that Velázquez was looking at me,
514.527	"and I thought, ""Oh. I'm the subject of the painting."""
518.522	"And I thought, ""I'm not going to be able to do that painting."""
520.774	I was to the point where I was using a stopwatch
523.975	and painting squares out of randomness,
528.413	and I wasn't getting anywhere. So I went back and dumped
530.431	all my paintings in the Arno, and I thought, I'm going to just start playing around.
533.661	JB: Richard Serra says that so nonchalantly, you might
536.493	have missed it. He went and saw this painting by a guy
540.101	who'd been dead for 300 years, and realized,
543.869	"""I can't do that,"" and so Richard Serra went back"
547.741	to his studio in Florence, picked up all of his work
550.572	up to that point, and threw it in a river.
554.375	Richard Serra let go of painting at that moment,
558.311	but he didn't let go of art. He moved to New York City,
561.837	and he put together a list of verbs
564.751	— to roll, to crease, to fold —
568.039	more than a hundred of them, and as he said,
570.735	he just started playing around. He did these things
572.772	to all kinds of material. He would take a huge sheet of lead
576.089	and roll it up and unroll it. He would do the same thing
579.887	"to rubber, and when he got to the direction ""to lift,"""
585.063	he created this, which is in the Museum of Modern Art.
590.161	Richard Serra had to let go of painting
593.121	in order to embark on this playful exploration
596.561	that led him to the work that he's known for today:
599.831	huge curves of steel that require our time and motion
605.409	to experience. In sculpture,
609.146	Richard Serra is able to do what he couldn't do in painting.
612.417	He makes us the subject of his art.
616.913	So experience and challenge
620.849	and limitations are all things we need to embrace
624.509	for creativity to flourish.
627.105	There's a fourth embrace, and it's the hardest.
630.665	It's the embrace of loss,
633.025	the oldest and most constant of human experiences.
637.315	In order to create, we have to stand in that space
640.138	between what we see in the world and what we hope for,
643.938	looking squarely at rejection, at heartbreak,
648.745	at war, at death.
651.319	That's a tough space to stand in.
653.709	"The educator Parker Palmer calls it ""the tragic gap,"""
659.098	tragic not because it's sad but because it's inevitable,
663.065	and my friend Dick Nodel likes to say,
666.105	"""You can hold that tension like a violin string"
669.049	"and make something beautiful."""
672.485	That tension resonates in the work of the photographer
675.623	Joel Meyerowitz, who at the beginning of his career was
678.833	known for his street photography, for capturing a moment
682.073	on the street, and also for his beautiful photographs
685.755	of landscapes -- of Tuscany, of Cape Cod,
689.439	of light.
692.121	Joel is a New Yorker, and his studio for many years
695.39	was in Chelsea, with a straight view downtown
699.388	to the World Trade Center, and he photographed
702.303	those buildings in every sort of light.
706.636	You know where this story goes.
710.286	On 9/11, Joel wasn't in New York. He was out of town,
712.774	but he raced back to the city, and raced down to the site
717.373	of the destruction.
719.498	Joel Meyerowitz: And like all the other passersby,
721.677	I stood outside the chain link fence on Chambers
724.577	and Greenwich, and all I could see was the smoke
726.775	and a little bit of rubble, and I raised my camera
730.445	to take a peek, just to see if there was something to see,
733.445	and some cop, a lady cop, hit me on my shoulder,
737.789	"and said, ""Hey, no pictures!"""
740.229	And it was such a blow that it woke me up,
743.453	in the way that it was meant to be, I guess.
747.509	And when I asked her why no pictures, she said,
749.552	"""It's a crime scene. No photographs allowed."""
752.643	"And I asked her, ""What would happen if I was a member"
754.112	"of the press?"" And she told me,"
756.316	"""Oh, look back there,"" and back a block was the press corps"
760.41	tied up in a little penned-in area,
764.22	"and I said, ""Well, when do they go in?"""
765.741	"and she said, ""Probably never."""
768.223	And as I walked away from that, I had this crystallization,
772.714	probably from the blow, because it was an insult in a way.
775.508	"I thought, ""Oh, if there's no pictures,"
777.683	"then there'll be no record. We need a record."""
781.189	"And I thought, ""I'm gonna make that record."
783.059	I'll find a way to get in, because I don't want to
785.346	"see this history disappear."""
787.214	JB: He did. He pulled in every favor he could,
791.457	and got a pass into the World Trade Center site,
793.97	where he photographed for nine months almost every day.
798.202	Looking at these photographs today brings back
801.146	the smell of smoke that lingered on my clothes
804.051	when I went home to my family at night.
806.048	My office was just a few blocks away.
809.466	But some of these photographs are beautiful,
813.082	and we wondered, was it difficult for Joel Meyerowitz
816.197	to make such beauty out of such devastation?
820.539	JM: Well, you know, ugly, I mean, powerful
823.905	and tragic and horrific and everything, but
827.276	it was also as, in nature, an enormous event
831.572	that was transformed after the fact into this residue,
836.738	and like many other ruins
838.554	— you go to the ruins of the Colosseum or the ruins of a cathedral someplace —
842.403	and they take on a new meaning when you watch the weather.
847.04	I mean, there were afternoons I was down there,
848.913	and the light goes pink and there's a mist in the air
852.563	and you're standing in the rubble, and I found myself
856.594	recognizing both the inherent beauty of nature
860.478	and the fact that nature, as time,
863.232	is erasing this wound.
866.627	Time is unstoppable, and it transforms the event.
870.461	It gets further and further away from the day,
872.79	and light and seasons temper it in some way,
877.145	and it's not that I'm a romantic. I'm really a realist.
881.289	The reality is, there's the Woolworth Building
884.773	in a veil of smoke from the site, but it's now like a scrim
890.601	across a theater, and it's turning pink,
894.545	you know, and down below there are hoses spraying,
897.648	and the lights have come on for the evening, and the water
900.657	is turning acid green because the sodium lamps are on,
904.685	"and I'm thinking, ""My God, who could dream this up?"""
906.862	But the fact is, I'm there, it looks like that,
911.063	you have to take a picture.
912.957	JB: You have to take a picture. That sense of urgency,
916.15	of the need to get to work, is so powerful in Joel's story.
921.95	When I saw Joel Meyerowitz recently, I told him how much
925.303	I admired his passionate obstinacy, his determination
929.088	to push through all the bureaucratic red tape to get to work,
933.671	"and he laughed, and he said, ""I'm stubborn,"
935.847	but I think what's more important
938.251	"is my passionate optimism."""
941.712	The first time I told these stories, a man in the audience
944.515	"raised his hand and said, ""All these artists talk about"
948.005	their work, not their art, which has got me thinking about
952.743	my work and where the creativity is there,
955.411	"and I'm not an artist."" He's right. We all wrestle"
960.039	with experience and challenge, limits and loss.
964.655	Creativity is essential to all of us,
966.906	whether we're scientists or teachers,
969.559	parents or entrepreneurs.
973.918	I want to leave you with another
976.095	image of a Japanese tea bowl. This one
979.189	is at the Freer Gallery in Washington, D.C.
982.159	It's more than a hundred years old and you can still see
984.695	the fingermarks where the potter pinched it.
988.338	But as you can also see, this one did break
991.255	at some point in its hundred years.
993.975	But the person who put it back together,
996.735	instead of hiding the cracks,
999.299	decided to emphasize them, using gold lacquer to repair it.
1005.015	This bowl is more beautiful now, having been broken,
1009.459	than it was when it was first made,
1012.471	and we can look at those cracks, because
1014.701	they tell the story that we all live,
1017.066	of the cycle of creation and destruction,
1020.743	of control and letting go, of picking up the pieces
1025.67	and making something new.
1027.669	Thank you. (Applause)
