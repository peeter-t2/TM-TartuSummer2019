26.325	These bees are in my backyard
26.325	in Berkeley, California.
30.822	Until last year,
30.822	I'd never kept bees before,
33.221	but National Geographic asked me
33.221	to photograph a story about them,
37.27	and I decided, to be able
37.27	to take compelling images,
39.769	I should start keeping bees myself.
42.253	And as you may know,
43.948	bees pollinate one third
43.948	of our food crops,
46.572	and lately they've been having
46.572	a really hard time.
49.73	So as a photographer, I wanted to explore
49.73	what this problem really looks like.
54.281	So I'm going to show you
54.281	what I found over the last year.
58.276	This furry little creature
59.9	is a fresh young bee halfway emerged
59.9	from its brood cell,
64.243	and bees right now are dealing
64.243	with several different problems,
67.283	including pesticides, diseases,
67.283	and habitat loss,
71.535	but the single greatest threat
71.535	is a parasitic mite from Asia,
76.146	Varroa destructor.
78.475	And this pinhead-sized mite
78.475	crawls onto young bees
81.354	and sucks their blood.
83.699	This eventually destroys a hive
85.696	because it weakens
85.696	the immune system of the bees,
88.94	and it makes them more vulnerable
88.94	to stress and disease.
93.776	Now, bees are the most sensitive
95.773	when they're developing
95.773	inside their brood cells,
98.513	and I wanted to know
98.513	what that process really looks like,
101.624	so I teamed up
101.624	with a bee lab at U.C. Davis
104.248	and figured out how to raise bees
104.248	in front of a camera.
107.993	I'm going to show you
107.993	the first 21 days of a bee's life
110.981	condensed into 60 seconds.
115.763	This is a bee egg
115.763	as it hatches into a larva,
120.567	and those newly hatched larvae
120.567	swim around their cells
125.012	feeding on this white goo
125.012	that nurse bees secrete for them.
131.616	Then, their head and their legs
131.616	slowly differentiate
136.159	as they transform into pupae.
141.833	Here's that same pupation process,
143.853	and you can actually see the mites
143.853	running around in the cells.
147.243	Then the tissue in their body reorganizes
151.51	and the pigment slowly
151.51	develops in their eyes.
158.869	The last step of the process
158.869	is their skin shrivels up
164.757	and they sprout hair.
167.245	(Music)
180.805	So -- (Applause)
186.703	As you can see halfway
186.703	through that video,
189.907	the mites were running around
189.907	on the baby bees,
192.461	and the way that beekeepers
192.461	typically manage these mites
196.39	is they treat their hives with chemicals.
199.404	In the long run, that's bad news,
201.67	so researchers are working
201.67	on finding alternatives
205.223	to control these mites.
208.195	This is one of those alternatives.
210.963	It's an experimental breeding program
210.963	at the USDA Bee Lab in Baton Rouge,
215.328	and this queen and her attendant bees
215.328	are part of that program.
219.735	Now, the researchers figured out
223.43	that some of the bees have
223.43	a natural ability to fight mites,
227.152	so they set out to breed
227.152	a line of mite-resistant bees.
232.782	This is what it takes
232.782	to breed bees in a lab.
235.418	The virgin queen is sedated
238.158	and then artificially inseminated
238.158	using this precision instrument.
243.2	Now, this procedure allows the researchers
245.478	to control exactly
245.478	which bees are being crossed,
250.5	but there's a tradeoff
250.5	in having this much control.
253.627	They succeeded in breeding
253.627	mite-resistant bees,
256.832	but in that process, those bees
256.832	started to lose traits
259.92	like their gentleness
259.92	and their ability to store honey,
263.685	so to overcome that problem,
266.194	these researchers are now collaborating
266.194	with commercial beekeepers.
270.252	This is Bret Adee opening
270.252	one of his 72,000 beehives.
275.12	He and his brother run the largest
275.12	beekeeping operation in the world,
279.75	and the USDA is integrating their
279.75	mite-resistant bees into his operation
285.409	with the hope that over time,
287.052	they'll be able to select the bees
287.052	that are not only mite-resistant
290.723	but also retain all of these qualities
290.723	that make them useful to us.
296.165	And to say it like that
297.86	makes it sound like we're manipulating
297.86	and exploiting bees,
301.157	and the truth is, we've been doing that
301.157	for thousands of years.
304.593	We took this wild creature
304.593	and put it inside of a box,
309.747	practically domesticating it,
311.861	and originally that was
311.861	so that we could harvest their honey,
315.97	but over time we started losing
315.97	our native pollinators,
318.725	our wild pollinators,
320.42	and there are many places now
320.42	where those wild pollinators
323.485	can no longer meet the pollination
323.485	demands of our agriculture,
327.284	so these managed bees have become
327.284	an integral part of our food system.
332.508	So when people talk about saving bees,
335.227	my interpretation of that
337.36	is we need to save
337.36	our relationship to bees,
340.588	and in order to design new solutions,
345.592	we have to understand
345.592	the basic biology of bees
350.693	and understand the effects
350.693	of stressors that we sometimes cannot see.
357.909	In other words, we have
357.909	to understand bees up close.
361.114	Thank you.
363.384	(Applause)
