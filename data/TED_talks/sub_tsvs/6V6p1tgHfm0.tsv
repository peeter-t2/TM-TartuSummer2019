12.58	So you probably have the sense,
12.58	as most people do,
15.66	that polarization
15.66	is getting worse in our country,
19.34	that the divide
19.34	between the left and the right
22.82	is as bad as it's been
22.82	in really any of our lifetimes.
26.38	But you might also reasonably wonder
26.38	if research backs up your intuition.
32.38	And in a nutshell,
32.38	the answer is sadly yes.
38.74	In study after study, we find
40.78	that liberals and conservatives
40.78	have grown further apart.
45.26	They increasingly wall themselves off
45.26	in these ideological silos,
50.06	consuming different news,
50.06	talking only to like-minded others
54.22	and more and more choosing
54.22	to live in different parts of the country.
58.54	And I think that
58.54	most alarming of all of it
61.78	is seeing this rising
61.78	animosity on both sides.
66.26	Liberals and conservatives,
67.94	Democrats and Republicans,
69.86	more and more they just
69.86	don't like one another.
74.14	You see it in many different ways.
76.18	They don't want to befriend one another.
76.18	They don't want to date one another.
79.86	If they do, if they find out,
79.86	they find each other less attractive,
83.18	and they more and more don't want
83.18	their children to marry someone
86.3	who supports the other party,
88.02	a particularly shocking statistic.
91.46	You know, in my lab,
91.46	the students that I work with,
94.3	we're talking about
94.3	some sort of social pattern --
97.78	I'm a movie buff, and so I'm often like,
101.34	what kind of movie are we in here
101.34	with this pattern?
104.9	So what kind of movie are we in
104.9	with political polarization?
108.9	Well, it could be a disaster movie.
112.7	It certainly seems like a disaster.
114.74	Could be a war movie.
117.46	Also fits.
119.3	But what I keep thinking is that
119.3	we're in a zombie apocalypse movie.
123.14	(Laughter)
124.62	Right? You know the kind.
126.94	There's people wandering around in packs,
129.38	not thinking for themselves,
131.18	seized by this mob mentality
132.82	trying to spread their disease
132.82	and destroy society.
137.3	And you probably think, as I do,
139.66	that you're the good guy
139.66	in the zombie apocalypse movie,
143.14	and all this hate and polarization,
143.14	it's being propagated by the other people,
146.86	because we're Brad Pitt, right?
149.58	Free-thinking, righteous,
152.5	just trying to hold on
152.5	to what we hold dear,
154.82	you know, not foot soldiers
154.82	in the army of the undead.
158.42	Not that.
159.9	Never that.
161.9	But here's the thing:
163.42	what movie do you suppose
163.42	they think they're in?
167.3	Right?
168.54	Well, they absolutely think
168.54	that they're the good guys
171.1	in the zombie apocalypse movie. Right?
172.98	And you'd better believe
172.98	that they think that they're Brad Pitt
175.98	and that we, we are the zombies.
180.94	And who's to say that they're wrong?
184.26	I think that the truth is
184.26	that we're all a part of this.
188.06	And the good side of that
188.06	is that we can be a part of the solution.
192.1	So what are we going to do?
195.14	What can we do to chip away
195.14	at polarization in everyday life?
199.42	What could we do to connect with
199.42	and communicate with
203.26	our political counterparts?
205.54	Well, these were exactly the questions
205.54	that I and my colleague, Matt Feinberg,
209.7	became fascinated with a few years ago,
211.582	and we started
211.582	doing research on this topic.
214.74	And one of the first things
214.74	that we discovered
217.74	that I think is really helpful
217.74	for understanding polarization
221.22	is to understand
222.46	that the political divide in our country
222.46	is undergirded by a deeper moral divide.
226.9	So one of the most robust findings
226.9	in the history of political psychology
231.7	is this pattern identified
231.7	by Jon Haidt and Jesse Graham,
235.42	psychologists,
236.66	that liberals and conservatives
236.66	tend to endorse different values
240.7	to different degrees.
242.42	So for example, we find that liberals
242.42	tend to endorse values like equality
247.94	and fairness and care
247.94	and protection from harm
251.62	more than conservatives do.
253.78	And conservatives tend to endorse
253.78	values like loyalty, patriotism,
259.06	respect for authority and moral purity
262.54	more than liberals do.
265.74	And Matt and I were thinking
265.74	that maybe this moral divide
269.82	might be helpful
269.82	for understanding how it is
272.94	that liberals and conservatives
272.94	talk to one another
275.38	and why they so often
275.38	seem to talk past one another
277.82	when they do.
279.06	So we conducted a study
281.06	where we recruited liberals to a study
284.18	where they were supposed
284.18	to write a persuasive essay
286.66	that would be compelling to a conservative
286.66	in support of same-sex marriage.
291.62	And what we found was that liberals
291.62	tended to make arguments
294.9	in terms of the liberal moral values
294.9	of equality and fairness.
299.1	So they said things like,
300.86	"""Everyone should have the right"
300.86	"to love whoever they choose,"""
304.26	"and, ""They"" -- they being gay Americans --"
306.86	"""deserve the same equal rights"
306.86	"as other Americans."""
310.18	Overall, we found
310.18	that 69 percent of liberals
313.42	invoked one of the more liberal
313.42	moral values in constructing their essay,
318.86	and only nine percent invoked
318.86	one of the more conservative moral values,
322.58	even though they were supposed
322.58	to be trying to persuade conservatives.
326.02	And when we studied conservatives
326.02	and had them make persuasive arguments
330.34	in support of making English
330.34	the official language of the US,
333.26	a classically conservative
333.26	political position,
335.82	we found that they weren't
335.82	much better at this.
339.7	in terms of one of the more
339.7	conservative moral values,
342.42	and just eight percent
342.42	invoked a liberal moral value,
344.94	even though they were supposed
344.94	to be targeting liberals for persuasion.
349.3	Now, you can see right away
349.3	why we're in trouble here. Right?
354.1	People's moral values,
354.1	they're their most deeply held beliefs.
357.62	People are willing
357.62	to fight and die for their values.
361.54	Why are they going to give that up
361.54	just to agree with you
364.26	on something that they don't particularly
364.26	want to agree with you on anyway?
367.82	If that persuasive appeal that
367.82	you're making to your Republican uncle
371.1	means that he doesn't
371.1	just have to change his view,
373.54	he's got to change
373.54	his underlying values, too,
375.73	that's not going to go very far.
377.9	So what would work better?
380.02	Well, we believe it's a technique
380.02	that we call moral reframing,
384.34	and we've studied it
384.34	in a series of experiments.
386.98	In one of these experiments,
388.5	we recruited liberals
388.5	and conservatives to a study
391.66	where they read one of three essays
393.98	before having their environmental
393.98	attitudes surveyed.
397.46	And the first of these essays
398.98	was a relatively conventional
398.98	pro-environmental essay
402.38	that invoked the liberal values
402.38	of care and protection from harm.
406.42	It said things like,
406.42	"""In many important ways"
408.98	we are causing real harm
408.98	"to the places we live in,"""
411.82	"and, ""It is essential"
411.82	that we take steps now
414.66	to prevent further destruction
414.66	"from being done to our Earth."""
418.94	Another group of participants
420.38	were assigned to read
420.38	a really different essay
422.62	that was designed to tap into
422.62	the conservative value of moral purity.
428.01	It was a pro-environmental essay as well,
430.02	and it said things like,
431.54	"""Keeping our forests, drinking water,"
431.54	"and skies pure is of vital importance."""
436.82	"""We should regard the pollution"
438.34	of the places we live in
438.34	"to be disgusting."""
440.98	"And, ""Reducing pollution"
440.98	can help us preserve
443.1	what is pure and beautiful
443.1	"about the places we live."""
447.7	And then we had a third group
449.14	that were assigned
449.14	to read just a nonpolitical essay.
451.66	It was just a comparison group
451.66	so we could get a baseline.
454.42	And what we found when we surveyed people
456.397	about their environmental
456.397	attitudes afterwards,
458.62	we found that liberals,
458.62	it didn't matter what essay they read.
461.58	They tended to have highly
461.58	pro-environmental attitudes regardless.
464.7	Liberals are on board
464.7	for environmental protection.
467.14	Conservatives, however,
468.38	were significantly more supportive
468.38	of progressive environmental policies
472.82	and environmental protection
474.38	if they had read the moral purity essay
476.46	than if they read
476.46	one of the other two essays.
479.98	We even found that conservatives
479.98	who read the moral purity essay
483.1	were significantly more likely to say
483.1	that they believed in global warming
486.62	and were concerned about global warming,
488.549	even though this essay
488.549	didn't even mention global warming.
491.3	That's just a related environmental issue.
493.78	But that's how robust
493.78	this moral reframing effect was.
497.78	And we've studied this on a whole slew
497.78	of different political issues.
501.54	So if you want to move conservatives
505.3	on issues like same-sex marriage
505.3	or national health insurance,
508.42	it helps to tie these liberal
508.42	political issues to conservative values
511.9	like patriotism and moral purity.
515.62	And we studied it the other way, too.
517.74	If you want to move liberals
517.74	to the right on conservative policy issues
521.58	like military spending and making English
521.58	the official language of the US,
526.22	you're going to be more persuasive
527.9	if you tie those conservative
527.9	policy issues to liberal moral values
531.26	like equality and fairness.
534.46	All these studies
534.46	have the same clear message:
537.34	if you want to persuade
537.34	someone on some policy,
540.3	it's helpful to connect that policy
540.3	to their underlying moral values.
545.34	And when you say it like that
547.54	it seems really obvious. Right?
549.06	Like, why did we come here tonight?
550.86	Why --
552.1	(Laughter)
553.66	It's incredibly intuitive.
557.22	And even though it is,
557.22	it's something we really struggle to do.
560.54	You know, it turns out that when we go
560.54	to persuade somebody on a political issue,
564.42	we talk like we're speaking into a mirror.
567.18	We don't persuade so much
567.18	as we rehearse our own reasons
571.58	for why we believe
571.58	some sort of political position.
575.22	We kept saying when we were designing
575.22	these reframed moral arguments,
579.66	"""Empathy and respect,"
579.66	"empathy and respect."""
582.86	If you can tap into that,
584.34	you can connect
586.02	and you might be able to persuade
586.02	somebody in this country.
589.38	So thinking again
591.82	about what movie we're in,
595.02	maybe I got carried away before.
596.62	Maybe it's not a zombie apocalypse movie.
599.34	Maybe instead it's a buddy cop movie.
601.86	(Laughter)
603.9	Just roll with it, just go with it please.
605.94	(Laughter)
608.3	You know the kind:
608.3	there's a white cop and a black cop,
611.02	or maybe a messy cop and an organized cop.
613.18	Whatever it is, they don't get along
615.26	because of this difference.
617.34	But in the end, when they have
617.34	to come together and they cooperate,
620.58	the solidarity that they feel,
622.54	it's greater because of that gulf
622.54	that they had to cross. Right?
627.1	And remember that in these movies,
629.1	it's usually worst in the second act
632.02	when our leads are further apart
632.02	than ever before.
635.26	And so maybe that's
635.26	where we are in this country,
637.62	late in the second act
637.62	of a buddy cop movie --
639.82	(Laughter)
642.42	torn apart but about
642.42	to come back together.
647.22	It sounds good,
648.9	but if we want it to happen,
650.78	I think the responsibility
650.78	is going to start with us.
654.34	So this is my call to you:
657.3	let's put this country back together.
660.9	Let's do it despite the politicians
663.98	and the media and Facebook and Twitter
666.86	and Congressional redistricting
668.42	and all of it,
668.42	all the things that divide us.
672.18	Let's do it because it's right.
675.74	And let's do it
675.74	because this hate and contempt
680.18	that flows through all of us every day
683.22	makes us ugly and it corrupts us,
686.42	and it threatens
686.42	the very fabric of our society.
691.78	We owe it to one another and our country
694.46	to reach out and try to connect.
697.82	We can't afford to hate them any longer,
702.02	and we can't afford
702.02	to let them hate us either.
705.7	Empathy and respect.
707.7	Empathy and respect.
709.74	If you think about it, it's the very least
709.74	that we owe our fellow citizens.
714.22	Thank you.
715.46	(Applause)
