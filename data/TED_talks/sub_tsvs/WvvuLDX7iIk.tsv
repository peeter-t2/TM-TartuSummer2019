12.827	I was recently traveling
12.827	in the Highlands of New Guinea,
15.912	and I was talking with a man
15.912	who had three wives.
18.905	"I asked him, ""How many wives"
18.905	"would you like to have?"""
22.34	And there was this long pause,
23.798	and I thought to myself,
25.017	"""Is he going to say five?"
26.592	Is he going to say 10?
28.043	"Is he going to say 25?"""
29.909	And he leaned towards me
31.095	"and he whispered, ""None."""
32.629	(Laughter)
35.514	Eighty-six percent of human societies
35.514	permit a man to have several wives:
39.913	polygyny.
41.088	But in the vast majority
41.088	of these cultures,
43.221	only about five or ten percent of men
43.221	actually do have several wives.
47.543	Having several partners
47.543	can be a toothache.
49.914	In fact, co-wives can
49.914	fight with each other,
53.058	sometimes they can even poison
53.058	each other's children.
56.455	And you've got to have
56.455	a lot of cows, a lot of goats,
59.13	a lot of money, a lot of land,
61.119	in order to build a harem.
63.017	We are a pair-bonding species.
65.416	Ninety-seven percent of mammals
65.416	do not pair up to rear their young;
68.978	human beings do.
70.83	I'm not suggesting that we're not --
73.004	that we're necessarily
73.004	sexually faithful to our partners.
76.175	I've looked at adultery in 42 cultures,
78.947	I understand, actually,
78.947	some of the genetics of it,
81.406	and some of the brain circuitry of it.
83.278	It's very common around the world,
85.245	but we are built to love.
87.716	How is technology changing love?
91.515	I'm going to say almost not at all.
94.744	I study the brain.
96.122	I and my colleagues have put
96.122	over 100 people into a brain scanner --
99.876	people who had just
99.876	fallen happily in love,
102.907	people who had just been rejected in love
104.962	and people who are in love long-term.
106.859	And it is possible
106.859	"to remain ""in love"" long-term."
110.543	And I've long ago maintained
112.473	that we've evolved three distinctly
112.473	different brain systems
115.522	for mating and reproduction:
117.383	sex drive,
118.559	feelings of intense romantic love
120.519	and feelings of deep cosmic
120.519	attachment to a long-term partner.
124.289	And together, these three brain systems --
126.749	with many other parts of the brain --
129.261	orchestrate our sexual,
129.261	our romantic and our family lives.
134.411	But they lie way below the cortex,
136.828	way below the limbic system
136.828	where we feel our emotions,
141.073	generate our emotions.
142.384	They lie in the most primitive parts
142.384	of the brain, linked with energy,
147.223	focus, craving, motivation,
147.223	wanting and drive.
152.503	In this case,
153.68	the drive to win life's greatest prize:
156.235	a mating partner.
157.693	They evolved over 4.4 million years ago
157.693	among our first ancestors,
162.234	and they're not going to change
162.234	if you swipe left or right on Tinder.
166.72	(Laughter)
168.291	(Applause)
170.761	There's no question that technology
170.761	is changing the way we court:
175.4	emailing, texting,
177.348	emojis to express your emotions,
179.347	sexting,
180.635	"""liking"" a photograph, selfies ..."
183.095	We're seeing new rules
183.095	and taboos for how to court.
187.936	But, you know --
189.947	is this actually
189.947	dramatically changing love?
193.73	What about the late 1940s,
196.118	when the automobile became very popular
198.703	and we suddenly had rolling bedrooms?
201.073	(Laughter)
202.815	How about the introduction
202.815	of the birth control pill?
207.491	Unchained from the great threat
207.491	of pregnancy and social ruin,
212.812	women could finally express
212.812	their primitive and primal sexuality.
217.724	Even dating sites are not changing love.
220.765	I'm Chief Scientific Advisor to Match.com,
223.347	I've been it for 11 years.
225.051	I keep telling them
225.051	and they agree with me,
227.079	that these are not dating sites,
228.642	they are introducing sites.
231.017	When you sit down in a bar,
233.304	in a coffee house,
234.912	on a park bench,
236.292	your ancient brain snaps into action
236.292	like a sleeping cat awakened,
241.321	and you smile
242.644	and laugh
243.826	and listen
245.032	and parade the way our ancestors
245.032	did 100,000 years ago.
250.424	We can give you various people --
252.401	all the dating sites can --
253.99	but the only real algorithm
253.99	is your own human brain.
257.927	Technology is not going to change that.
261.041	Technology is also not going to change
261.041	who you choose to love.
265.709	I study the biology of personality,
268.429	and I've come to believe
269.665	that we've evolved four very broad
269.665	styles of thinking and behaving,
273.972	linked with the dopamine, serotonin,
275.826	testosterone and estrogen systems.
278.358	So I created a questionnaire
278.358	directly from brain science
282.535	to measure the degree to which
282.535	you express the traits --
285.701	the constellation of traits --
287.479	linked with each
287.479	of these four brain systems.
290.829	I then put that questionnaire
290.829	on various dating sites
295.721	in 40 countries.
297.969	Fourteen million or more people
297.969	have now taken the questionnaire,
301.883	and I've been able to watch
301.883	who's naturally drawn to whom.
306.462	And as it turns out,
307.997	those who were very expressive
307.997	of the dopamine system
310.59	tend to be curious, creative,
310.59	spontaneous, energetic --
313.749	I would imagine there's an awful lot
313.749	of people like that in this room --
317.224	they're drawn to people like themselves.
319.176	Curious, creative people
319.176	need people like themselves.
322.583	People who are very expressive
322.583	of the serotonin system
325.245	tend to be traditional, conventional,
325.245	they follow the rules,
328.148	they respect authority,
330.05	they tend to be religious -- religiosity
330.05	is in the serotonin system --
333.46	and traditional people
333.46	go for traditional people.
336.821	In that way, similarity attracts.
339.509	In the other two cases, opposites attract.
341.755	People very expressive
341.755	of the testosterone system
344.076	tend to be analytical,
344.076	logical, direct, decisive,
348.023	and they go for their opposite:
349.529	they go for somebody who's high estrogen,
351.806	somebody who's got very good verbal skills
354.072	and people skills,
355.338	who's very intuitive
356.81	and who's very nurturing
356.81	and emotionally expressive.
360.519	We have natural patterns of mate choice.
363.468	Modern technology is not going
363.468	to change who we choose to love.
369.488	But technology is producing
369.488	one modern trend
372.065	that I find particularly important.
374.151	It's associated with the concept
374.151	of paradox of choice.
378.372	For millions of years,
379.85	we lived in little hunting
379.85	and gathering groups.
382.141	You didn't have the opportunity to choose
384.691	between 1,000 people on a dating site.
388.261	In fact, I've been studying this recently,
390.342	and I actually think there's some
390.342	sort of sweet spot in the brain;
393.521	I don't know what it is, but apparently,
393.521	from reading a lot of the data,
397.496	we can embrace about five
397.496	to nine alternatives, and after that,
402.671	you get into what academics
402.671	"call ""cognitive overload,"""
405.915	and you don't choose any.
408.175	So I've come to think that due
408.175	to this cognitive overload,
411.345	we're ushering in a new form of courtship
414.68	"that I call ""slow love."""
417.219	I arrived at this during
417.219	my work with Match.com.
421.4	Every year for the last six years,
423.105	we've done a study called
423.105	"""Singles in America."""
425.822	We don't poll the Match population,
427.654	we poll the American population.
429.638	We use 5,000-plus people,
432.631	a representative sample of Americans
432.631	based on the US census.
436.552	We've got data now on over 30,000 people,
439.468	and every single year,
441.959	I see some of the same patterns.
444.509	Every single year when I ask the question,
447.312	over 50 percent of people
447.312	have had a one-night stand --
450.099	not necessarily last year,
450.099	but in their lives --
	a friends with benefits
455.087	during the course of their lives,
456.718	and over 50 percent have lived
456.718	with a person long-term
460.31	before marrying.
461.77	Americans think that this is reckless.
463.996	I have doubted that for a long time;
466.939	the patterns are too strong.
468.855	There's got to be some
468.855	Darwinian explanation --
471.607	Not that many people are crazy.
473.957	And I stumbled, then, on a statistic
473.957	that really came home to me.
478.267	It was a very interesting academic article
480.89	in which I found that 67 percent
480.89	of singles in America today
485.927	who are living long-term with somebody,
488.365	have not yet married because
488.365	they are terrified of divorce.
492.476	They're terrified of the social,
494.356	legal, emotional,
495.913	economic consequences of divorce.
498.806	So I came to realize that I don't think
498.806	this is recklessness;
502.588	I think it's caution.
504.791	Today's singles want to know
504.791	every single thing about a partner
509.837	before they wed.
511.49	You learn a lot between the sheets,
513.443	not only about how somebody makes love,
515.979	but whether they're kind,
517.373	whether they can listen
518.739	and at my age,
519.935	whether they've got a sense of humor.
521.737	(Laughter)
523.164	And in an age where we have
523.164	too many choices,
527.075	we have very little fear
527.075	of pregnancy and disease
530.361	and we've got no feeling of shame
530.361	for sex before marriage,
534.093	I think people are taking
534.093	their time to love.
538.408	And actually, what's happening is,
540.083	what we're seeing is a real expansion
540.083	of the precommitment stage
543.968	before you tie the knot.
546.034	Where marriage used to be
546.034	the beginning of a relationship,
548.784	now it's the finale.
551.413	But the human brain --
553.177	(Laughter)
555.21	The human brain always triumphs,
557.048	and indeed, in the United States today,
	will marry by age 49.
562.489	And even in cultures around the world
562.489	where they're not marrying as often,
566.059	they are settling down eventually
566.059	with a long-term partner.
569.358	So it began to occur to me:
571.217	during this long extension
571.217	of the precommitment stage,
575.808	if you can get rid of bad
575.808	relationships before you marry,
579.005	maybe we're going to see
579.005	more happy marriages.
581.838	So I did a study of 1,100
581.838	married people in America --
586.737	not on Match.com, of course --
588.488	and I asked them a lot of questions.
590.628	But one of the questions was,
592.159	"""Would you re-marry the person"
592.159	"you're currently married to?"""
596.755	"And 81 percent said, ""Yes."""
600.613	In fact, the greatest change
600.613	in modern romance and family life
607.116	is not technology.
609.07	It's not even slow love.
611.047	It's actually women
611.047	piling into the job market
614.022	in cultures around the world.
615.767	For millions of years,
617.02	our ancestors lived
617.02	in little hunting and gathering groups.
620.014	Women commuted to work
620.014	to gather their fruits and vegetables.
622.943	They came home with 60 to 80
622.943	percent of the evening meal.
626.477	The double-income family was the rule.
629.194	And women were regarded
629.194	as just as economically, socially
633.159	and sexually powerful as men.
636.298	Then the environment changed
636.298	some 10,000 years ago,
639.424	we began to settle down on the farm
641.677	and both men and women
641.677	became obliged, really,
644.892	to marry the right person,
646.488	from the right background,
647.942	from the right religion
649.269	and from the right kin
649.269	and social and political connections.
652.831	Men's jobs became more important:
654.449	they had to move the rocks,
654.449	fell the trees, plow the land.
657.21	They brought the produce
657.21	to local markets, and came home
660.158	with the equivalent of money.
661.696	Along with this,
663.266	we see a rise of a host of beliefs:
666.267	the belief of virginity at marriage,
668.473	arranged marriages --
668.473	strictly arranged marriages --
671.44	the belief that the man
671.44	is the head of the household,
673.991	that the wife's place is in the home
676.254	and most important,
677.431	honor thy husband,
677.431	and 'til death do us part.
680.586	These are gone.
682.332	They are going, and in many places,
684.905	they are gone.
686.317	We are right now in a marriage revolution.
689.764	We are shedding 10,000 years
689.764	of our farming tradition
694.503	and moving forward towards egalitarian
694.503	relationships between the sexes --
700.153	something I regard as highly compatible
700.153	with the ancient human spirit.
705.562	I'm not a Pollyanna;
707.288	there's a great deal to cry about.
709.073	I've studied divorce in 80 cultures,
710.843	I've studied, as I say,
710.843	adultery in many --
713.003	there's a whole pile of problems.
714.843	As William Butler Yeats,
714.843	the poet, once said,
718.059	"""Love is the crooked thing."""
721.131	"I would add, ""Nobody gets out alive."""
723.945	(Laughter)
725.064	We all have problems.
726.925	But in fact, I think the poet
726.925	Randall Jarrell really sums it up best.
730.553	"He said, ""The dark, uneasy world"
730.553	of family life --
735.576	where the greatest can fail,
735.576	"and the humblest succeed."""
740.779	But I will leave you with this:
742.69	love and attachment will prevail,
745.442	technology cannot change it.
747.999	And I will conclude by saying
749.861	any understanding of human relationships
749.861	must take into account
755.131	one the most powerful determinants
755.131	of human behavior:
759.38	the unquenchable,
761.217	adaptable
762.789	and primordial human drive to love.
765.819	Thank you.
766.995	(Applause)
771.915	Kelly Stoetzel: Thank you
771.915	so much for that, Helen.
774.32	As you know, there's another
774.32	speaker here with us
776.653	that works in your same field.
778.227	She comes at it
778.227	from a different perspective.
780.682	Esther Perel is a psychotherapist
780.682	who works with couples.
785.749	You study data,
787.066	Esther studies the stories
787.066	the couples tell her
789.59	when they come to her for help.
791.642	Let's have her join us on the stage.
793.39	Esther?
794.565	(Applause)
802.249	So Esther,
803.519	when you were watching Helen's talk,
805.815	was there any part of it
807.045	that resonated with you
807.045	through the lens of your own work
809.836	that you'd like to comment on?
812.062	Esther Perel: It's interesting,
812.062	because on the one hand,
815.665	the need for love
815.665	is ubiquitous and universal.
819.965	But the way we love --
821.953	the meaning we make out of it --
823.507	the rules that govern
823.507	our relationships, I think,
825.856	are changing fundamentally.
827.907	We come from a model that, until now,
830.831	was primarily regulated
830.831	around duty and obligation,
834.318	the needs of the collective and loyalty.
836.739	And we have shifted it
837.943	to a model of free choice
837.943	and individual rights,
842.297	and self-fulfillment and happiness.
845.397	And so, that was
845.397	the first thing I thought,
847.741	that the need doesn't change,
849.533	but the context and the way
849.533	we regulate these relationships
853.365	changes a lot.
854.667	On the paradox of choice --
858.682	you know, on the one hand
858.682	we relish the novelty
861.033	and the playfulness, I think,
862.649	to be able to have so many options.
865.384	And at the same time,
866.769	as you talk about this cognitive overload,
869.207	I see many, many people who ...
874.391	who dread the uncertainty and self-doubt
878.521	that comes with this massa of choice,
881.094	"creating a case of ""FOMO"""
883.377	and then leading us --
885.043	FOMO, fear of missed opportunity,
885.043	or fear of missing out --
888.382	"it's like, ""How do I know"
888.382	I have found 'the one' --
891.364	"the right one?"""
892.56	So we've created what I call
892.56	"this thing of ""stable ambiguity."""
896.6	Stable ambiguity is when
896.6	you are too afraid to be alone
900.329	but also not really willing
900.329	to engage in intimacy-building.
904.388	It's a set of tactics that kind of prolong
904.388	the uncertainty of a relationship
909.706	but also the uncertainty of the breakup.
912.337	So, here on the internet
912.337	you have three major ones.
915.343	One is icing and simmering,
917.688	which are great stalling tactics
920.587	that offer a kind of holding pattern
923.088	that emphasizes the undefined
923.088	nature of a relationship
926.906	but at the same time gives you
926.906	enough of a comforting consistency
931.037	and enough freedom
931.037	of the undefined boundaries.
933.818	(Laughter)
936.07	Yeah?
937.264	And then comes ghosting.
938.836	And ghosting is, basically,
940.832	you disappear from this massa
940.832	of texts on the spot,
945.376	and you don't have to deal with
945.376	the pain that you inflict on another,
949.185	because you're making it
949.185	invisible even to yourself.
951.807	(Laughter)
953.018	Yeah?
954.2	So I was thinking -- these words came up
954.2	for me as I was listening to you,
958.961	like how a vocabulary
958.961	also creates a reality,
964.148	and at the same time,
965.727	that's my question to you:
967.435	Do you think when the context changes,
970.399	it still means that the nature
970.399	of love remains the same?
974.063	You study the brain and I study
974.063	people's relationships and stories,
978.185	so I think it's everything you say, plus.
982.691	But I don't always know the degree
982.691	to which a changing context ...
987.451	Does it at some point begin to change --
990.005	If the meaning changes,
990.005	does it change the need,
992.642	or is the need clear
992.642	of the entire context?
995.797	HF: Wow! Well --
997.241	(Laughter)
999.696	(Applause)
1002.895	Well, I've got three points here, right?
1006.736	First of all, to your first one:
1008.586	there's no question that we've changed,
1008.586	that we now want a person to love,
1012.203	and for thousands of years,
1012.203	we had to marry the right person
1015.072	from the right background
1015.072	and right kin connection.
1017.497	And in fact, in my studies
1017.497	of 5,000 people every year,
1020.742	"I ask them, ""What are you looking for?"""
1022.892	And every single year,
1022.892	over 97 percent say --
1025.674	EP: The list grows --
1026.908	HF: Well, no.
1028.092	The basic thing is
1028.092	over 97 percent of people
1031.439	want somebody that respects them,
1033.554	somebody they can trust and confide in,
1035.866	somebody who makes them laugh,
1037.546	somebody who makes enough time for them
1039.452	and somebody who they find
1039.452	physically attractive.
1043.473	That never changes.
1044.78	And there's certainly -- you know,
1044.78	there's two parts --
1047.982	EP: But you know how I call that?
1049.586	That's not what people used to say --
1051.86	HF: That's exactly right.
1053.114	EP: They said they wanted somebody
1053.114	with whom they have companionship,
1056.437	economic support, children.
1057.752	We went from a production economy
1057.752	to a service economy.
1060.362	(Laughter)
1061.395	We did it in the larger culture,
1061.395	and we're doing it in marriage.
1064.4	HF: Right, no question about it.
1065.972	But it's interesting, the millennials
1065.972	actually want to be very good parents,
1069.906	whereas the generation above them
1069.906	wants to have a very fine marriage
1074.05	but is not as focused
1074.05	on being a good parent.
1076.296	You see all of these nuances.
1078.403	There's two basic parts of personality:
1080.983	there's your culture -- everything you
1080.983	grew up to do and believe and say --
1084.582	and there's your temperament.
1086.005	Basically, what I've been talking
1086.005	about is your temperament.
1088.856	And that temperament is certainly
1088.856	going to change with changing times
1092.198	and changing beliefs.
1093.891	And in terms of the paradox of choice,
1097.062	there's no question about it
1097.062	that this is a pickle.
1099.493	There were millions of years
1099.493	where you found that sweet boy
1102.381	at the other side of the water hole,
1104.13	and you went for it.
1105.305	EP: Yes, but you --
1106.48	HF: I do want to say one more thing.
1108.251	The bottom line is, in hunting
1108.251	and gathering societies,
1110.892	they tended to have two or three partners
1110.892	during the course of their lives.
1114.514	They weren't square!
1115.696	And I'm not suggesting that we do,
1117.376	but the bottom line is,
1117.376	we've always had alternatives.
1121.376	Mankind is always --
1122.879	in fact, the brain is well-built
1122.879	"to what we call ""equilibrate,"""
1126.095	to try and decide:
1127.27	Do I come, do I stay? Do I go, do I stay?
1129.728	What are the opportunities here?
1131.3	How do I handle this there?
1132.626	And so I think we're seeing
1132.626	another play-out of that now.
1136.052	KS: Well, thank you both so much.
1137.699	I think you're going to have
1137.699	a million dinner partners for tonight!
1140.929	(Applause)
1142.932	Thank you, thank you.
