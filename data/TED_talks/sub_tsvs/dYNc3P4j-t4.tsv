12.714	Let me ask you all a question.
16.282	How much weapons-grade nuclear
16.282	material do you think it would take
20.17	to level a city the size of San Francisco?
23.554	How many of you think
23.554	it would be an amount
25.61	about the size of this suitcase?
29.685	OK. And how about this minibus?
34.327	All right.
35.504	Well actually, under
35.504	the right circumstances,
38.222	an amount of highly enriched uranium
38.222	about the size of your morning latte
43.697	would be enough to kill 100,000 people
46.639	instantly.
48.522	Hundreds of thousands of others
48.522	would become horribly ill,
52.616	and parts of the city
52.616	would be uninhabitable for years,
55.665	if not for decades.
57.993	But you can forget that nuclear latte,
60.58	because today's nuclear weapons
60.58	are hundreds of times more powerful
66.574	even than those we dropped
66.574	on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
70.891	And even a limited nuclear war
70.891	involving, say, tens of nuclear weapons,
76.234	could lead to the end
76.234	of all life on the planet.
81.609	So it's really important that you know
84.907	that right now we have
84.907	over 15,000 nuclear weapons
90.012	in the hands of nine nations.
92.251	And if you live in a city
92.251	or near a military facility,
96.904	one is likely pointed right at you.
100.523	In fact, if you live in any
100.523	of the rural areas
103.438	where nuclear weapons are stored globally,
105.944	one is likely pointed at you.
108.188	About 1,800 of these weapons
108.188	are on high alert,
112.694	which means they can be launched
112.694	within 15 minutes
116.408	of a presidential command.
120.228	So I know this is a bummer of an issue,
123.819	and maybe you have that --
123.819	what was it? -- psychic fatigue
126.656	that we heard about a little bit earlier.
128.745	So I'm going to switch gears
128.745	for just a second,
131.072	and I'm going to talk
131.072	about my imaginary friend,
133.482	who I like to think of as Jasmine,
136.292	just for a moment.
137.662	Jasmine, at the age of 25,
140.203	is part of a generation that is more
140.203	politically and socially engaged
144.582	than anything we've seen in 50 years.
147.011	She and her friends think of themselves
148.974	as change agents
148.974	and leaders and activists.
152.247	I think of them as Generation Possible.
156.317	They regularly protest
156.317	about the issues they care about,
159.422	but nuclear weapons are not one of them,
159.422	which makes sense,
162.854	because Jasmine was born in 1991,
162.854	at the end of the Cold War.
167.076	So she didn't grow up hearing a lot
167.076	about nuclear weapons.
170.206	She never had to duck and cover
170.206	under her desk at school.
173.813	For Jasmine, a fallout shelter
173.813	is an app in the Android store.
178.128	Nuclear weapons help win games.
180.847	And that is really a shame,
183.305	because right now, we need
183.305	Generation Possible
186.603	to help us make some really important
186.603	decisions about nuclear weapons.
191.545	For instance, will we further reduce
191.545	our nuclear arsenals globally,
198.005	or will we spend billions,
200.945	maybe a trillion dollars,
203.192	to modernize them so they last
203.192	throughout the 21st century,
206.538	so that by the time Jasmine is my age,
206.538	she's talking to her children
209.861	and maybe even her grandchildren
211.816	about the threat of nuclear holocaust?
215.098	And if you're paying any attention
215.098	at all to cyberthreats,
218.028	or, for instance, if you've read
218.028	about the Stuxnet virus
222.019	or, for God's sake, if you've ever
222.019	had an email account or a Yahoo account
225.908	or a phone hacked,
227.98	you can imagine the whole new world
227.98	of hurt that could be triggered
232.156	by modernization in a period
232.156	of cyberwarfare.
235.944	Now, if you're paying
235.944	attention to the money,
238.185	a trillion dollars could go a long way
241.27	to feeding and educating
241.27	and employing people,
244.137	all of which could reduce the threat
244.137	of nuclear war to begin with.
248.691	So --
249.869	(Applause)
252.915	This is really crucial right now,
255.392	because nuclear weapons --
255.392	they're vulnerable.
259.274	We have solid evidence
260.885	that terrorists are trying
260.885	to get ahold of them.
264.551	Just this last spring,
265.896	when four retirees
265.896	and two taxi drivers were arrested
270.626	in the Republic of Georgia
272.249	for trying to sell nuclear materials
272.249	for 200 million dollars,
275.998	they demonstrated that the black market
275.998	for this stuff is alive and well.
280.111	And it's really important,
281.396	because there have been
281.396	dozens of accidents
285.217	involving nuclear weapons,
286.522	and I bet most of us have never heard
286.522	anything about them.
289.587	Just here in the United States,
291.153	we've dropped nuclear weapons
291.153	on the Carolinas twice.
295.203	In one case, one of the bombs,
297.553	which fell out of an Air Force plane,
299.749	didn't detonate
300.972	because the nuclear core
300.972	was stored somewhere else on the plane.
304.109	In another case, the weapon
304.109	did arm when it hit the ground,
308.169	and five of the switches designed
308.169	to keep it from detonating failed.
312.935	Luckily, the sixth one didn't.
315.521	But if that's not enough
315.521	to get your attention,
318.973	there was the 1995 Black Brant incident.
322.655	That's when Russian radar technicians saw
324.958	what they thought was a US nuclear missile
327.501	streaking towards Russian airspace.
330.172	It later turned out to be
330.172	a Norwegian rocket
332.916	collecting data about the northern lights.
335.522	But at that time,
336.7	Russian President Boris Yeltsin
336.7	came within five minutes
340.495	of launching a full-scale
340.495	retaliatory nuclear attack
344.671	against the United States.
348.924	So, most of the world's nuclear nations
352.99	have committed to getting rid
352.99	of these weapons of mass destruction.
357.352	But consider this:
359.835	the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation
359.835	of Nuclear Weapons,
363.183	which is the most widely adopted
363.183	arms control treaty in history
366.644	with 190 signatories,
369.398	sets no specific date by which
369.398	the world's nuclear-armed nations
374.716	will get rid of their nuclear weapons.
377.692	Now, when John F. Kennedy
377.692	sent a man to the moon
380.486	and decided to bring him back,
380.486	or decided to do both those things,
383.681	"he didn't say, ""Hey, whenever"
383.681	"you guys get to it."""
386.625	He gave us a deadline.
388.656	He gave us a challenge
390.502	that would have been incredible
390.502	just a few years earlier.
394.033	And with that challenge,
395.559	he inspired scientists and marketers,
398.458	astronauts and schoolteachers.
401.152	He gave us a vision.
403.928	But along with that vision,
405.927	he also tried to give us -- and most
405.927	people don't know this, either --
409.495	he tried to give us a partner
411.503	in the form of our fiercest
411.503	Cold War rival, the Soviet Union.
416.948	Because part of Kennedy's vision
416.948	for the Apollo program
420.006	was that it be a cooperation,
420.006	not a competition, with the Soviets.
423.817	And apparently, Nikita Khrushchev,
423.817	the Soviet Premier, agreed.
428.007	But before that cooperation
428.007	could be realized,
431.347	Kennedy was assassinated,
433.042	and that part of the vision was deferred.
436.581	But the promise of joint innovation
436.581	between these two nuclear superpowers
441.784	wasn't totally extinguished.
444.305	Because in 1991, which is the year
444.305	that Jasmine was born
448.222	and the Soviet Union fell,
450.732	these two nations engaged in a project
453.529	that genuinely does seem incredible today
456.11	in the truest sense of that word,
458.812	which is that the US sent cash
458.812	to the Russians when they needed it most,
463.432	to secure loose nuclear materials
466.211	and to employ out-of-work
466.211	nuclear scientists.
469.44	They worked alongside American scientists
469.44	to convert weapons-grade uranium
476.167	into the type of fuel that can be used
476.167	for nuclear power instead.
480.464	"They called it, ""Megatons to Megawatts."""
484.202	So the result is that for over 20 years,
487.362	our two nations had a program
490.193	that meant that one in 10 lightbulbs
490.193	in the United States
494.03	was essentially fueled
494.03	by former Russian warheads.
499.53	So, together these two nations
499.53	did something truly audacious.
503.905	But the good news is,
503.905	the global community has the chance
507.998	to do something just as audacious today.
512.897	To get rid of nuclear weapons
515.448	and to end the supply of the materials
515.448	required to produce them,
520.01	some experts tell me would take 30 years.
523.219	It would take a renaissance of sorts,
525.71	the kinds of innovation that,
525.71	for better or worse,
528.149	underpinned both the Manhattan Project,
528.149	which gave rise to nuclear weapons,
532.147	and the Megatons to Megawatts program.
535.019	It would take design constraints.
537.665	These are fundamental to creativity,
540.407	things like a platform
540.407	for international collaboration;
544.447	a date certain, which is
544.447	a forcing mechanism;
548.925	and a positive vision
548.925	that inspires action.
552.735	It would take us to 2045.
556.468	Now, 2045 happens to be
556.468	the 100th anniversary
560.973	of the birth of nuclear weapons
560.973	in the New Mexico desert.
565.247	But it's also an important date
565.247	for another reason.
568.458	It's predicted to be the advent
568.458	of the singularity,
573.011	a new moment in human development,
575.431	where the lines between artificial
575.431	intelligence and human intelligence blur,
581.106	where computing and consciousness
581.106	become almost indistinguishable
585.559	and advanced technologies help us solve
585.559	the 21st century's greatest problems:
591.215	hunger, energy, poverty,
594.133	ushering in an era of abundance.
598.318	And we all get to go to space
599.924	on our way to becoming
599.924	a multi-planetary species.
604.039	Now, the people who really believe
604.039	this vision are the first to say
607.915	they don't yet know precisely
607.915	how we're going to get there.
611.618	But the values behind their vision
614.434	"and the willingness to ask ""How might we?"""
617.789	have inspired a generation of innovators.
620.884	They're working backward
620.884	from the outcomes they want,
624.38	using the creative problem-solving methods
624.38	of collaborative design.
628.608	They're busting through obstacles.
630.872	They're redefining
630.872	what we all consider possible.
635.513	But here's the thing:
637.706	that vision of abundance isn't compatible
641.94	with a world that still relies
641.94	on a 20th-century nuclear doctrine
648.169	"called ""mutually assured destruction."""
652.945	It has to be about building
652.945	the foundations for the 22nd century.
658.446	It has to be about strategies
658.446	for mutually assured prosperity
664.276	or, at the very least,
664.276	mutually assured survival.
669.175	Now, every day, I get to meet
669.175	people who are real pioneers
674.422	in the field of nuclear threats.
676.363	As you can see, many of them
676.363	are young women,
679.888	and they're doing fiercely
679.888	interesting stuff,
682.488	like Mareena Robinson Snowden here,
682.488	who is developing new ways,
687.015	better ways, to detect nuclear warheads,
689.701	which will help us
689.701	overcome a critical hurdle
691.948	to international disarmament.
693.906	Or Melissa Hanham, who is using
693.906	satellite imaging
696.799	to make sense of what's going on
696.799	around far-flung nuclear sites.
701.358	Or we have Beatrice Fihn in Europe,
704.079	who has been campaigning
704.079	to make nuclear weapons illegal
708.376	in international courts of law,
710.084	and just won a big victory
710.084	at the UN last week.
713	(Applause)
716.202	And yet,
717.942	and yet,
719.797	with all of our talk in this culture
719.797	about moon shots,
723.239	too few members of Generation Possible
723.239	and those of us who mentor them
727.991	are taking on nuclear weapons.
730.524	It's as if there's a taboo.
733.898	But I remember something Kennedy said
733.898	that has really stuck with me,
738.597	and that is something to the effect
740.379	that humans can be as big as the solutions
742.545	to all the problems we've created.
744.427	No problem of human destiny, he said,
747.685	is beyond human beings.
751.296	I believe that.
753.376	And I bet a lot of you here
753.376	believe that, too.
756.535	And I know Generation
756.535	Possible believes it.
760.646	So it's time to commit to a date.
765.183	Let's end the nuclear weapons chapter
768.735	on the 100th anniversary of its inception.
773.119	After all, by 2045, we will have held
773.119	billions of people hostage
777.869	to the threat of nuclear annihilation.
780.167	Surely, 100 years will have been enough.
783.512	Surely, a century of economic development
787.215	and the development of military strategy
790.634	will have given us better ways
790.634	to manage global conflict.
794.802	Surely, if ever there was a global
794.802	moon shot worth supporting,
799.759	this is it.
801.846	Now, in the face of real threats --
804.484	for instance, North Korea's recent
804.484	nuclear weapons tests,
807.504	which fly in the face of sanctions --
809.808	reasonable people disagree
812.132	about whether we should maintain
812.132	some number of nuclear weapons
816.055	to deter aggression.
818.55	But the question is:
818.55	What's the magic number?
822.205	Is it a thousand?
824.14	Is it a hundred? Ten?
827.246	And then we have to ask:
829.395	Who should be responsible for them?
832.038	I think we can agree, however,
833.92	that having 15,000 of them
833.92	represents a greater global threat
837.993	to Jasmine's generation than a promise.
841.184	So it's time we make a promise
844.366	of a world in which we've broken
844.366	the stranglehold
847.103	that nuclear weapons have
847.103	on our imaginations;
850.625	in which we invest
850.625	in the creative solutions
853.261	that come from working backward
853.261	from the future we desperately want,
857.015	rather than plodding forward
857.015	from a present
859.573	that brings all of the mental models
859.573	and biases of the past with it.
864.392	It's time we pledge our resources
864.392	as leaders across the spectrum
869.718	to work on this old problem in new ways,
873.146	"to ask, ""How might we?"""
876.001	How might we make good on a promise
878.328	of greater security
878.328	for Jasmine's generation
881.929	in a world beyond nuclear weapons?
886.116	I truly hope you will join us.
889.782	Thank you.
890.969	(Applause)
894.295	Thank you.
895.992	(Applause)
