12.695	When I was nine years old,
14.599	my mom asked me what I would want
14.599	my house to look like,
18.037	and I drew this fairy mushroom.
20.52	And then she actually built it.
23.794	(Laughter)
25.791	I don't think I realized
25.791	this was so unusual at the time,
28.415	and maybe I still haven't,
29.947	because I'm still designing houses.
35.325	This is a six-story bespoke home
35.325	on the island of Bali.
38.698	It's built almost entirely from bamboo.
42.36	The living room overlooks the valley
42.36	from the fourth floor.
46.967	You enter the house by a bridge.
50.548	It can get hot in the tropics,
52.405	so we make big curving roofs
52.405	to catch the breezes.
57.76	But some rooms have tall windows
57.76	to keep the air conditioning in
61.498	and the bugs out.
65.515	This room we left open.
67.233	We made an air-conditioned, tented bed.
70.935	And one client wanted a TV room
70.935	in the corner of her living room.
74.569	Boxing off an area with tall walls
74.569	just didn't feel right,
78.332	so instead, we made this giant woven pod.
84.477	Now, we do have all the necessary
84.477	luxuries, like bathrooms.
88.63	This one is a basket
88.63	in the corner of the living room,
92.999	and I've got tell you, some people
92.999	actually hesitate to use it.
96.513	We have not quite figured out
96.513	our acoustic insulation.
99.485	(Laughter)
101.923	So there are lots of things
101.923	that we're still working on,
104.5	but one thing I have learned
106.7	is that bamboo will treat you well
106.7	if you use it right.
110.907	It's actually a wild grass.
112.952	It grows on otherwise unproductive land --
115.924	deep ravines, mountainsides.
119.267	It lives off of rainwater,
119.267	spring water, sunlight,
123.493	and of the 1,450 species of bamboo
123.493	that grow across the world,
128.253	we use just seven of them.
130.691	That's my dad.
132.119	He's the one who got me
132.119	building with bamboo,
134.22	and he is standing in a clump
136.31	of Dendrocalamus asper niger
136.31	that he planted just seven years ago.
140.327	Each year, it sends up
140.327	a new generation of shoots.
143.369	That shoot, we watched it grow a meter
143.369	in three days just last week,
148.143	so we're talking about sustainable
148.143	timber in three years.
155.225	Now, we harvest from hundreds
155.225	of family-owned clumps.
158.638	Betung, as we call it, it's really long,
161.29	up to 18 meters of usable length.
162.956	Try getting that truck down the mountain.
165.487	And it's strong: it has
165.487	the tensile strength of steel,
169.133	the compressive strength of concrete.
171.849	Slam four tons straight down on a pole,
174.775	and it can take it.
177.492	Because it's hollow, it's lightweight,
180.69	light enough to be lifted
180.69	by just a few men,
183.41	or, apparently, one woman.
186.13	(Laughter) (Applause)
194.279	And when my father
194.279	built Green School in Bali,
198.435	he chose bamboo for all
198.435	of the buildings on campus,
201.639	because he saw it as a promise.
203.892	It's a promise to the kids.
205.796	It's one sustainable material
205.796	that they will not run out of.
210.547	And when I first saw these structures
210.547	under construction about six years ago,
214.694	I just thought, this makes perfect sense.
218.78	It is growing all around us.
220.893	It's strong. It's elegant.
223.283	It's earthquake-resistant.
225.514	Why hasn't this happened sooner,
225.514	and what can we do with it next?
229.61	So along with some of
229.61	the original builders of Green School,
234.637	I founded Ibuku.
236.613	"Ibu means ""mother,"" and ku means ""mine,"""
236.613	so it represents my Mother Earth,
242.271	and at Ibuku, we are a team
242.271	of artisans, architects and designers,
247.363	and what we're doing together
247.363	is creating a new way of building.
252.316	Over the past five years together,
254.677	we have built over 50 unique structures,
254.677	most of them in Bali.
260.737	Nine of them are at Green Village --
263.779	you've just seen inside
263.779	some of these homes --
266.612	and we fill them with bespoke furniture,
270.776	we surround them with veggie gardens,
272.834	we would love to invite you all
272.834	to come visit someday.
275.946	And while you're there,
275.946	you can also see Green School --
278.974	we keep building
278.974	classrooms there each year --
281.588	as well as an updated
281.588	fairy mushroom house.
286.548	We're also working on
286.548	a little house for export.
289.938	This is a traditional Sumbanese home
289.938	that we replicated,
293.119	right down to the details and textiles.
297.056	A restaurant
297.056	with an open-air kitchen.
301.31	It looks a lot like a kitchen, right?
304.32	And a bridge that spans
309.15	Now, what we're doing,
309.15	it's not entirely new.
313.691	From little huts to elaborate bridges
313.691	like this one in Java,
318.22	bamboo has been in use across
318.22	the tropical regions of the world
321.33	for literally tens of thousands of years.
324.232	There are islands and even continents
324.232	that were first reached by bamboo rafts.
330.29	But until recently,
332.823	it was almost impossible to reliably
332.823	protect bamboo from insects,
337.444	and so, just about everything
337.444	that was ever built out of bamboo is gone.
342.613	Unprotected bamboo weathers.
344.981	Untreated bamboo gets eaten to dust.
348.371	And so that's why most people,
348.371	especially in Asia,
351.65	think that you couldn't be poor enough
351.65	or rural enough to actually want
355.546	to live in a bamboo house.
358.146	And so we thought,
359.981	what will it take to change their minds,
362.326	to convince people
362.326	that bamboo is worth building with,
365.507	much less worth aspiring to?
368.34	First, we needed safe treatment solutions.
371.428	Borax is a natural salt.
373.123	It turns bamboo into
373.123	a viable building material.
375.839	Treat it properly, design it carefully,
378.602	and a bamboo structure
378.602	can last a lifetime.
382.39	Second, build something
382.39	extraordinary out of it.
386.148	Inspire people.
388.24	Fortunately,
389.294	Balinese culture fosters craftsmanship.
391.168	It values the artisan.
393.143	So combine those
393.143	with the adventurous outliers
395.97	from new generations
395.97	of locally trained architects
399.105	and designers and engineers,
402.53	and always remember that you are designing
405.683	for curving, tapering, hollow poles.
409.451	No two poles alike, no straight lines,
412.725	no two-by-fours here.
415.128	The tried-and-true, well-crafted formulas
415.128	and vocabulary of architecture
420.109	do not apply here.
421.427	We have had to invent our own rules.
423.731	We ask the bamboo what it's good at,
423.731	what it wants to become,
428.198	and what it says is: respect it,
428.198	design for its strengths,
432.69	protect it from water,
432.69	and to make the most of its curves.
436.435	So we design in real 3D,
438.336	making scale structural models
440.159	out of the same material
440.159	that we'll later use to build the house.
443.258	And bamboo model-making, it's an art,
445.278	as well as some hardcore engineering.
454.752	So that's the blueprint of the house.
456.632	(Laughter)
459.042	And we bring it to site,
460.951	and with tiny rulers,
460.951	we measure each pole,
463.691	and consider each curve, and we choose
463.691	a piece of bamboo from the pile
468.288	to replicate that house on site.
472.064	When it comes down to the details,
472.064	we consider everything.
475.417	Why are doors so often rectangular?
477.53	Why not round?
478.876	How could you make a door better?
480.523	Well, its hinges battle with gravity,
482.498	and gravity will always win in the end,
484.658	so why not have it pivot on the center
487.398	where it can stay balanced?
489.65	And while you're at it,
489.65	why not doors shaped like teardrops?
494.316	To reap the selective benefits
494.316	and work within the constraints
497.366	of this material,
499.1	we have really had to push ourselves,
501.329	and within that constraint,
501.329	we have found space for something new.
507.235	It's a challenge: how
507.235	do you make a ceiling
509.525	if you don't have any
509.525	flat boards to work with?
512.66	Let me tell you, sometimes I dream
512.66	of sheet rock and plywood.
517.21	(Laughter)
519.71	But if what you've got
519.71	is skilled craftsmen
523.819	and itsy bitsy little splits,
526.49	weave that ceiling together,
528.672	stretch a canvas over it, lacquer it.
531.635	How do you design durable
531.635	kitchen countertops
534.352	that do justice to this curving
534.352	structure you've just built?
537.904	Slice up a boulder like a loaf of bread,
540.737	hand-carve each to fit the other,
543.106	leave the crusts on,
545.427	and what we're doing,
545.427	it is almost entirely handmade.
549.677	The structural connections
549.677	of our buildings
551.813	are reinforced by steel joints, but we use
551.813	a lot of hand-whittled bamboo pins.
556.695	There are thousands of pins in each floor.
560.891	This floor is made of glossy
560.891	and durable bamboo skin.
565.883	You can feel the texture under bare feet.
568.995	And the floor that you walk on,
571.61	can it affect the way that you walk?
573.453	Can it change the footprint
573.453	that you'll ultimately leave on the world?
578.329	I remember being nine years old
580.279	and feeling wonder,
582.183	and possibility,
584.2	and a little bit of idealism.
586.474	And we've got a really long way to go,
589.33	there's a lot left to learn,
591.732	but one thing I know is that
591.732	with creativity and commitment,
596.672	you can create beauty and comfort
601.223	and safety and even luxury
604.45	out of a material that will grow back.
607.408	Thank you.
609.651	(Applause)
