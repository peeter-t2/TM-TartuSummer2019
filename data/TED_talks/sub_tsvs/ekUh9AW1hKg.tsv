12.93	Even nature's most disgusting creatures
15.834	have important secrets,
18.401	but who would want a swarm of cockroaches
19.89	coming towards them?
21.484	Yet one of the greatest differences
21.484	between natural and human technologies
24.496	relates to robustness.
26.711	Robust systems are stable in complex
29.284	and new environments.
31.005	Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize
32.8	running over rough terrain.
34.479	When we put a jet pack on them,
35.741	or give them a perturbation like an earthquake,
37.752	we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs
40.643	allow them to self-stabilize
42.268	without using any of their brainpower.
45.93	They can go over complex terrain like grass,
49.06	no problem, and not get destabilized.
51.012	We discovered a new behavior where,
52.526	because of their shape,
53.69	they actually roll automatically to their side
55.768	to go through this artificial test bit of grass.
59.72	Robust systems can perform multiple tasks
62.157	with the same structure.
64.295	Here's a new behavior we've discovered.
66.162	The animals rapidly invert and disappear
68.008	in less than 150 milliseconds — you never see them —
70.509	using the same structures that
70.509	they use to run, their legs.
72.872	They can run upside down
74.476	very rapidly on rods, branches and wires,
77.608	and if you perturb one of those branches,
79.087	they can do this.
80.88	They can perform gymnastic maneuvers
82.41	like no robot we have yet.
84.988	And they have nearly unlimited
86.719	maneuverability with that same structure
89.316	and unprecedented access to a variety
93.136	of different areas.
97.406	They have wings for flying when they get warm,
100.029	but they use those same wings to flip over
102.643	if they get destabilized.
106.6	Very effective.
107.897	Robust systems are also fault tolerant and fail-safe.
111.102	This is the foot of a cockroach.
112.242	It has spines, gluey pads and claws,
115.531	but if you take off those feet,
117.122	they can still go over rough terrain,
118.83	like the bottom video that you see,
120.727	without hardly slowing down. Extraordinary.
124.098	They can run up mesh without their feet.
127.271	Here's an animal using a normal, alternating tripod:
129.554	three legs, three legs, three legs,
131.097	but in nature, the insects often have lost their legs.
134.789	Here's one moving with two middle legs gone.
138.799	It can even lose three legs, in a tripod,
141.715	and adopt a new gait, a hopping gait.
145.642	And I point out that all of these videos
147.6	are slowed down 20 times,
149.304	so they're actually really fast, when you see this.
151.319	Robust systems are also damage resistant.
154.83	Here's an animal climbing up a wall.
156.643	It looks like a rapid, smooth, vertical climb,
159.139	but when you slow it down,
160.378	you see something very different.
162.872	Here's what they do.
164.52	They intentionally have a
164.52	head-on collision with the wall
167.527	so they don't slow down and can transition up it
169.641	in 75 milliseconds.
172.039	And they can do this in part because they have
173.9	extraordinary exoskeletons.
175.957	And they're really just made up of compliant joints
179.766	that are tubes and plates
181.499	connected to one another.
183.042	Here's a dissection of an abdomen of a cockroach.
185.989	You see these plates, and you
185.989	see the compliant membrane.
189.95	My engineering colleague at Berkeley
192.766	designed with his students
193.89	a novel manufacturing technique
195.371	where you essentially origami the exoskeleton,
198.982	you laser cut it, laminate it,
200.342	and you fold it up into a robot.
202.737	And you can do that now in less than 15 minutes.
208.554	These robots, called DASH,
210.493	for Dynamic Autonomous Sprawled Hexapod,
213.103	are highly compliant robots,
216.185	and they're remarkably robust as a result
219.887	of these features.
221.69	They're certainly incredibly damage resistant.
227.748	(Laughter)
231.101	They even have some of the
231.101	behaviors of the cockroaches.
233.57	So they can use their smart, compliant body
235.843	to transition up a wall
238.36	in a very simple way.
241.252	They even have some of the beginnings
242.88	of the rapid inversion behavior
244.199	where they disappear.
247.043	Now we want to know why they can go anywhere.
248.52	We discovered that they can go through
250.089	three-millimeter gaps,
251.877	the height of two pennies, two stacked pennies,
254.238	and when they do this,
255.286	they can actually run through those confined spaces
257.861	at high speeds,
259.618	although you never see it.
262.8	To understand it better,
263.862	we did a CT scan of the exoskeleton
265.94	and showed that they can compress their body
267.414	by over 40 percent.
270.06	We put them in a materials testing machine
271.617	to look at the stress strain analysis
273.973	and showed that they can withstand forces
277.995	and after this they can fly and run
279.885	absolutely normally.
281.875	So you never know where
283.598	curiosity-based research will lead,
286.672	and someday you may want a swarm
288.211	of cockroach-inspired robots
290.405	to come at you.
292.819	(Laughter)
299.94	Thank you.
301.497	(Applause)
