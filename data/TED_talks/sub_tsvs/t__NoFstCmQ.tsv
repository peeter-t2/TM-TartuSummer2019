12.972	Paul Krugman, the Nobel Prize
12.972	[winner] in economics, once wrote:
18.929	"""Productivity is not everything,"
18.929	but in the long run,
24.349	"it is almost everything."""
28.062	So this is serious.
30.214	There are not that many things on earth
30.214	"that are ""almost everything."""
36.138	Productivity is the principal driver
36.138	of the prosperity of a society.
43.56	So we have a problem.
45.837	In the largest European economies,
48.63	productivity used to grow
48.63	five percent per annum
51.804	in the '50s, '60s, early '70s.
54.943	From '73 to '83: three percent per annum.
58.995	From '83 to '95: two percent per annum.
62.308	Since 1995: less than
62.308	one percent per annum.
67.042	The same profile in Japan.
70.115	The same profile in the US,
73.009	despite a momentary rebound 15 years ago,
78.366	and despite all
78.366	the technological innovations
81.754	around us: the Internet, the information,
84.357	the new information
84.357	and communication technologies.
88.155	When productivity grows
88.155	three percent per annum,
92.758	you double the standard of living
92.758	every generation.
97.169	Every generation is twice
97.169	as well-off as its parents'.
102.686	When it grows one percent per annum,
106.036	it takes three generations
106.036	to double the standard of living.
109.687	And in this process, many people
109.687	will be less well-off than their parents.
115.505	They will have less of everything:
118.043	smaller roofs, or perhaps no roof at all,
122.645	less access to education, to vitamins,
122.645	to antibiotics, to vaccination --
129.068	to everything.
131.502	Think of all the problems
131.502	that we're facing at the moment.
138.347	All.
140.692	Chances are that they are rooted
140.692	in the productivity crisis.
147.226	Why this crisis?
150.438	Because the basic tenets
150.438	about efficiency --
155.937	effectiveness in organizations,
155.937	in management --
160.772	have become counterproductive
160.772	for human efforts.
165.539	Everywhere in public services --
165.539	in companies, in the way we work,
169.729	the way we innovate, invest --
169.729	try to learn to work better.
174.954	Take the holy trinity of efficiency:
180.805	clarity, measurement, accountability.
187.87	They make human efforts derail.
191.65	There are two ways
191.65	to look at it, to prove it.
195.746	One, the one I prefer,
198.436	is rigorous, elegant, nice -- math.
204.593	But the full math version
204.593	takes a little while,
207.88	so there is another one.
209.699	It is to look at a relay race.
212.697	This is what we will do today.
214.389	It's a bit more animated, more visual
214.389	and also faster -- it's a race.
221.572	Hopefully, it's faster.
222.89	(Laughter)
224.278	World championship final -- women.
229.26	Eight teams in the final.
231.395	The fastest team is the US team.
235.129	They have the fastest women on earth.
238.153	They are the favorite team to win.
240.952	Notably, if you compare them
240.952	to an average team,
245.166	say, the French team,
246.564	(Laughter)
248.175	based on their best performances
248.175	in the 100-meter race,
253.394	if you add the individual times
253.394	of the US runners,
259.187	they arrive at the finish line
259.187	3.2 meters ahead of the French team.
266.438	And this year, the US team
266.438	is in great shape.
270.034	Based on their best performance this year,
272.444	they arrive 6.4 meters
272.444	ahead of the French team,
277.373	based on the data.
279.274	We are going to look at the race.
280.877	At some point you will see,
280.877	towards the end,
283.324	that Torri Edwards,
283.324	the fourth US runner, is ahead.
289.654	Not surprising -- this year she got
289.654	the gold medal in the 100-meter race.
296.167	And by the way, Chryste Gaines,
296.167	the second runner in the US team,
301.133	is the fastest woman on earth.
303.794	So, there are 3.5 billion women on earth.
309.89	Where are the two fastest? On the US team.
313.087	And the two other runners
313.087	on the US team are not bad, either.
316.384	(Laughter)
318.124	So clearly, the US team has won
318.124	the war for talent.
324.391	But behind, the average team
324.391	is trying to catch up.
328.396	Let's watch the race.
330.3	(Video: French sportscasters narrate race)
378.886	(Video: Race narration ends)
382.112	Yves Morieux: So what happened?
383.631	The fastest team did not win;
383.631	the slower one did.
388.809	By the way, I hope you appreciate
390.77	the deep historical research I did
390.77	to make the French look good.
396.72	(Laughter)
401.485	But let's not exaggerate --
401.485	it's not archeology, either.
405.928	(Laughter)
407.933	But why?
409.123	Because of cooperation.
410.687	When you hear this sentence:
412.545	"""Thanks to cooperation, the whole"
412.545	"is worth more than the sum of the parts."""
417.707	This is not poetry;
417.707	this is not philosophy.
421.046	This is math.
423.196	Those who carry the baton are slower,
426.5	but their baton is faster.
428.848	Miracle of cooperation:
431.057	it multiplies energy,
431.057	intelligence in human efforts.
436.361	It is the essence of human efforts:
439.36	how we work together, how each effort
439.36	contributes to the efforts of others.
446.017	With cooperation,
446.017	we can do more with less.
449.788	Now, what happens to cooperation
449.788	when the holy grail --
455.36	the holy trinity, even --
457.822	of clarity, measurement, accountability --
464.067	appears?
466.952	Clarity.
468.128	Management reports are full of complaints
468.128	about the lack of clarity.
473.424	Compliance audits,
473.424	consultants' diagnostics.
478.49	We need more clarity, we need
478.49	to clarify the roles, the processes.
484.092	It is as though the runners
484.092	on the team were saying,
488.132	"""Let's be clear -- where does my role"
488.132	really start and end?
494.938	Am I supposed to run for 95 meters,
499.794	It's important, let's be clear.
502.885	If you say 97, after 97 meters,
505.915	people will drop the baton, whether
505.915	there is someone to take it or not.
511.145	Accountability.
513.084	We are constantly trying
513.084	to put accountability
516.558	in someone's hands.
518.559	Who is accountable for this process?
521.156	We need somebody accountable
521.156	for this process.
524.634	So in the relay race,
524.634	since passing the baton is so important,
529.119	then we need somebody
529.119	clearly accountable for passing the baton.
533.786	So between each runner,
535.989	now we will have a new dedicated athlete,
540.737	clearly dedicated to taking
540.737	the baton from one runner,
545.306	and passing it to the next runner.
548.284	And we will have at least two like that.
552.381	Well, will we, in that case, win the race?
559.903	That I don't know, but for sure,
561.928	we would have a clear interface,
565.222	a clear line of accountability.
567.89	We will know who to blame.
570.834	But we'll never win the race.
573.099	If you think about it,
573.099	we pay more attention
578.11	to knowing who to blame in case we fail,
582.289	than to creating
582.289	the conditions to succeed.
587.384	All the human intelligence
587.384	put in organization design --
590.771	urban structures, processing systems --
593.58	what is the real goal?
596.347	To have somebody guilty in case they fail.
600.499	We are creating
600.499	organizations able to fail,
605.41	but in a compliant way,
608.411	with somebody clearly
608.411	accountable when we fail.
611.877	And we are quite effective
611.877	at that -- failing.
616.892	Measurement.
618.674	What gets measured gets done.
620.126	Look, to pass the baton,
620.126	you have to do it at the right time,
624.541	in the right hand, at the right speed.
627.457	But to do that, you have to put
627.457	energy in your arm.
630.04	This energy that is in your arm
630.04	will not be in your legs.
633.491	It will come at the expense
633.491	of your measurable speed.
637.367	You have to shout early enough
637.367	to the next runner
640.844	when you will pass the baton,
640.844	to signal that you are arriving,
644.179	so that the next runner
644.179	can prepare, can anticipate.
647.408	And you have to shout loud.
650.182	But the blood, the energy
650.182	that will be in your throat
654.179	will not be in your legs.
655.603	Because you know, there are
655.603	eight people shouting at the same time.
659.383	So you have to recognize the voice
659.383	of your colleague.
662.372	"You cannot say, ""Is it you?"""
664.57	Too late!
665.748	(Laughter)
666.978	Now, let's look at the race
666.978	in slow motion,
671.978	and concentrate on the third runner.
674.55	Look at where she allocates her efforts,
678.997	her energy, her attention.
682.878	Not all in her legs -- that would
682.878	be great for her own speed --
686.046	but in also in her throat,
686.046	arm, eye, brain.
689.56	That makes a difference in whose legs?
692.314	In the legs of the next runner.
694.728	But when the next runner runs super-fast,
697.586	is it because she made a super effort,
699.738	or because of the way
699.738	the third runner passed the baton?
703.403	There is no metric on earth
703.403	that will give us the answer.
708.31	And if we reward people on the basis
708.31	of their measurable performance,
712.845	they will put their energy,
712.845	their attention, their blood
715.923	in what can get measured -- in their legs.
718.581	And the baton will fall and slow down.
721.534	To cooperate is not a super effort,
724.13	it is how you allocate your effort.
727.28	It is to take a risk,
729.144	because you sacrifice
729.144	the ultimate protection
733.398	granted by objectively measurable
733.398	individual performance.
740.516	It is to make a super difference
740.516	in the performance of others,
744.417	with whom we are compared.
746.757	It takes being stupid to cooperate, then.
749.551	And people are not stupid;
749.551	they don't cooperate.
752.738	You know, clarity, accountability,
752.738	measurement were OK
757.902	when the world was simpler.
760.929	But business has become much more complex.
763.977	With my teams, we have measured
766.032	the evolution of complexity in business.
769.08	It is much more demanding today
769.08	to attract and retain customers,
774.707	to build advantage on a global scale,
778.042	to create value.
780.691	And the more business gets complex,
783.472	the more, in the name of clarity,
783.472	accountability, measurement
788.797	we multiply structures,
788.797	processes, systems.
793.083	You know, this drive for clarity
793.083	and accountability triggers
797.916	a counterproductive multiplication
797.916	of interfaces, middle offices,
803.295	coordinators that do not only
803.295	mobilize people and resources,
808.356	but that also add obstacles.
811.276	And the more complicated the organization,
815.87	the more difficult it is to understand
815.87	what is really happening.
819.547	So we need summaries, proxies, reports,
824.991	key performance indicators, metrics.
828.315	So people put their energy
828.315	in what can get measured,
833.051	at the expense of cooperation.
835.17	And as performance deteriorates,
837.726	we add even more structure,
837.726	process, systems.
840.879	People spend their time in meetings,
843.735	writing reports they have
843.735	to do, undo and redo.
848.289	Based on our analysis,
848.289	teams in these organizations
851.735	spend between 40 and 80 percent
851.735	of their time wasting their time,
857.93	but working harder and harder,
857.93	longer and longer,
861.947	on less and less value-adding activities.
866.242	This is what is killing productivity,
868.576	what makes people suffer at work.
871.226	Our organizations are wasting
871.226	human intelligence.
875.787	They have turned against human efforts.
880.673	When people don't cooperate,
883.587	don't blame their mindsets,
883.587	their mentalities, their personality --
888.006	look at the work situations.
891.125	Is it really in their personal interest
891.125	to cooperate or not,
895.398	if, when they cooperate,
895.398	they are individually worse off?
899.914	Why would they cooperate?
901.922	When we blame personalities
905.538	instead of the clarity,
905.538	the accountability, the measurement,
911.72	we add injustice to ineffectiveness.
917.654	We need to create organizations
919.591	in which it becomes individually useful
919.591	for people to cooperate.
924.807	Remove the interfaces,
924.807	the middle offices --
929.626	all these complicated
929.626	coordination structures.
933.573	Don't look for clarity; go for fuzziness.
937.977	Fuzziness overlaps.
941.244	Remove most of the quantitative metrics
941.244	to assess performance.
946.2	"Speed the ""what."""
948.414	"Look at cooperation, the ""how."""
951.255	How did you pass the baton?
952.88	Did you throw it,
952.88	or did you pass it effectively?
958.569	Am I putting my energy
958.569	in what can get measured --
964.651	my legs, my speed --
964.651	or in passing the baton?
968.81	You, as leaders, as managers,
973.177	are you making it individually useful
973.177	for people to cooperate?
980.205	The future of our organizations,
983.367	our companies, our societies
987.184	hinges on your answer to these questions.
993.035	Thank you.
994.24	(Applause)
