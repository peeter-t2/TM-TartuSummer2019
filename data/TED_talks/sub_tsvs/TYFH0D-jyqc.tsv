12.865	I would like to invite you
14.611	to come along on a visit
16.341	to a dark continent.
18.399	It is the continent hidden
20.037	under the surface of the earth.
22.113	It is largely unexplored,
24.43	poorly understood,
24.43	and the stuff of legends.
27.137	But it is made also of dramatic landscapes
29.999	like this huge underground chamber,
32.518	and it is rich with surprising
32.518	biological and mineralogical worlds.
38.149	Thanks to the efforts of intrepid voyagers
38.149	in the last three centuries --
42.999	actually, we know also thanks
42.999	to satellite technology, of course --
46.857	we know almost every single square meter
46.857	of our planet's surface.
51.085	However, we know still very little
51.085	about what is hidden inside the earth.
56.05	Because a cave landscape,
56.05	like this deep shaft in Italy, is hidden,
61.999	the potential of cave exploration --
61.999	the geographical dimension --
65.377	is poorly understood and unappreciated.
67.769	Because we are creatures
67.769	living on the surface,
70.828	our perception of the inner
70.828	side of the planet
74.999	is in some ways skewed,
76.987	as is that of the depth of the oceans
79.463	or of the upper atmosphere.
83.094	However, since systematic cave exploration
83.094	started about one century ago,
90.076	we know actually that caves exist
90.076	in every continent of the world.
94.471	A single cave system,
94.471	like Mammoth Cave, which is in Kentucky,
98.539	can be as long
98.539	as more than 600 kilometers.
103.27	And an abyss like Krubera Voronya,
103.27	which is in the Caucasus region,
107.401	actually the deepest cave
107.401	explored in the world,
110.203	can go as far as more than 2,000
110.203	meters below the surface.
114.548	That means a journey of weeks
114.548	for a cave explorer.
119.545	Caves form in karstic regions.
122.795	So karstic regions are areas of the world
125.999	where the infiltrating water
125.999	along cracks, fractures,
129.513	can easily dissolve soluble lithologies,
133.497	forming a drainage system
133.497	of tunnels, conduits --
136.301	a three-dimensional network, actually.
138.804	Karstic regions cover almost 20 percent
138.804	of the continents' surface,
144.707	and we know actually that speleologists
144.707	in the last 50 years
149.855	have explored roughly 30,000 kilometers
149.855	of cave passages around the world,
155.543	which is a big number.
156.935	But geologists have estimated
156.935	that what is still missing,
161.458	to be discovered and mapped,
163.712	is something around 10 million kilometers.
167.287	That means that for each meter
167.287	of a cave that we already know,
170.601	that we have explored,
172.158	there are still some tens of kilometers
172.158	of undiscovered passages.
177.576	That means that this is really
177.576	an endless continent,
180.515	and we will never be able
180.515	to explore it completely.
184.597	And this estimation is made
184.597	without considering other types of caves,
188.117	like, for example, inside glaciers
188.117	or even volcanic caves,
192.58	which are not karstic,
192.58	but are formed by lava flows.
196.136	And if we have a look at other planets
196.136	like, for example, Mars,
201.816	you will see that this characteristic
203.69	is not so specific of our home planet.
207.623	However, I will show to you now
207.623	that we do not need to go to Mars
211.999	to explore alien worlds.
215.75	I'm a speleologist, that means
215.75	a cave explorer.
219.714	And I started with this passion
219.714	when I was really young
223.646	in the mountains not far
223.646	from my hometown in North Italy,
227.731	in the karstic regions of the Alps
227.731	and the Dolomites.
231.252	But soon, the quest for exploration
231.252	brought me to the farthest corner
235.117	of the planet, searching
235.117	for new potential entrances
237.87	of this undiscovered continent.
240.578	And in 2009, I had the opportunity
240.578	to visit the tepui table mountains,
245.663	which are in the Orinoco
245.663	and Amazon basins.
248.683	These massifs enchanted me
248.683	from the first time I saw them.
253.259	They are surrounded by vertical,
253.259	vertiginous rock walls
256.65	with silvery waterfalls
256.65	that are lost in the forest.
260.145	They really inspired in me
260.145	a sense of wilderness,
263.501	with a soul older than millions
263.501	and millions of years.
267.48	And this dramatic landscape
267.48	inspired among other things
271.415	also Conan Doyle's
271.415	"""The Lost World"" novel in 1912."
275.999	And they are, really, a lost world.
281.001	Scientists consider those mountains
281.001	as islands in time,
286.31	being separated
286.31	from the surrounding lowlands
288.972	since tens of millions of years ago.
291.68	They are surrounded
291.68	by up to 1,000-meter-high walls,
295.605	resembling a fortress,
295.605	impregnable by humans.
298.761	And, in fact, only a few
298.761	of these mountains have been climbed
301.999	and explored on their top.
304.74	These mountains contain also
304.74	a scientific paradox:
307.633	They are made by quartz,
309.717	which is a very common mineral
309.717	on the earth's crust,
312.908	and the rock made up by quartz
312.908	is called quartzite,
317.31	and quartzite is one of the hardest
317.31	and least soluble minerals on earth.
322.642	So we do not expect at all
322.642	to find a cave there.
326.057	Despite this, in the last 10 years,
326.057	speleologists from Italy,
330.999	Slovakia, Czech Republic,
330.999	and, of course, Venezuela and Brazil,
334.828	have explored several caves in this area.
337.831	So how can it be possible?
340.342	To understand this contradiction,
340.342	we have to consider the time factor,
344.427	because the history of the tepuis
344.427	is extremely long,
347.754	starting about 1.6 billion years ago
347.754	with the formation of the rock,
352.435	and then evolving with the uplift
352.435	of the region 150 million years ago,
358.999	after the disruption
358.999	of the Pangaea supercontinent
361.999	and the opening of the Atlantic Ocean.
364.376	So you can imagine that the water had tens
364.376	or even hundreds of millions of years
370.71	to sculpt the strangest forms
370.71	on the tepuis' surfaces,
374.792	but also to open the fractures
374.792	and form stone cities, rock cities,
380.83	fields of towers which are characterized
380.83	in the famous landscape of the tepuis.
386.375	But nobody could have imagined
387.843	what was happening inside a mountain
387.843	in so long a time frame.
392.603	And so I was focusing in 2010
392.603	on one of those massifs,
397.104	the Auyán-tepui, which is very famous
397.104	because it hosts Angel Falls,
400.979	which is the highest
400.979	waterfall in the world --
403.592	about 979 meters of vertical drop.
407.675	And I was searching for hints
407.675	of the existence of cave systems
412.585	through satellite images,
414.477	and finally we identified an area
414.477	of collapses of the surface --
419.191	so, big boulders, rock piles --
421.461	and that means that there
421.461	was a void below.
424.796	It was a clear indication that there
424.796	was something inside the mountain.
428.769	So we did several attempts
428.769	to reach this area,
433.639	by land and with a helicopter,
435.425	but it was really difficult
435.425	because -- you have to imagine
438.999	that these mountains are covered
438.999	by clouds most of the year, by fog.
443.402	There are strong winds,
444.799	and there are almost 4,000 millimeters
444.799	of rainfall per year,
449.405	so it's really, really difficult
449.405	to find good conditions.
452.691	And only in 2013 we finally
452.691	landed on the spot
457.498	and we started
457.498	the exploration of the cave.
460.723	The cave is huge.
462.664	It's a huge network under the surface
462.664	of the tepui plateau,
466.515	and in only ten days of expedition,
470.233	we explored more than 20 kilometers
470.233	of cave passages.
474.38	And it's a huge network
474.38	of underground rivers,
479.801	channels, big rooms,
479.801	extremely deep shafts.
484.999	So it's really an incredible place.
488.047	And we named it Imawarì Yeuta.
490.612	That means, in the Pemón indigenous
490.612	"language, ""The House of the Gods."""
496.897	You have to imagine that indigenous people
496.897	have never been there.
500.703	It was impossible for them
500.703	to reach this area.
504.232	However, there were legends
504.232	about the existence
506.462	of a cave in the mountain.
508.513	So when we started the exploration,
510.307	we had to explore with a great respect,
512.561	both because of the religious beliefs
512.561	of the indigenous people,
516.146	but also because
516.146	it was really a sacred place,
518.535	because no human had entered there before.
521.894	So we had to use special protocols
523.721	to not contaminate the environment
523.721	with our presence,
526.534	and we tried also to share
526.534	with the community,
528.733	with the indigenous community,
528.733	our discoveries.
531.43	And the caves represent, really,
531.43	a snapshot of the past.
536.503	The time needed for their formation
539.239	could be as long as 50 or even
544.187	which makes them possibly the oldest caves
544.187	that we can explore on earth.
550.921	What you can find there
550.921	is really evidence of a lost world.
557.301	When you enter a quartzite cave,
559.312	you have to completely forget
559.312	what you know about caves --
562.784	classic limestone caves
562.784	or the touristic caves
565.805	that you can visit
565.805	in several places in the world.
568.186	Because what seems
568.186	a simple stalactite here
571.135	is not made by calcium carbonate,
571.135	but is made by opal,
576.244	and one of those stalactites can require
576.244	tens of millions of years to be formed.
582.685	But you can find even stranger forms,
582.685	like these mushrooms of silica
586.786	growing on a boulder.
588.884	And you can imagine our talks
588.884	when we were exploring the cave.
592.694	We were the first entering
592.694	and discovering those unknown things,
597.711	things like those monster eggs.
600.573	And we were a bit scared
600.573	because it was all a discovery,
604.993	and we didn't want to find a dinosaur.
607.1	We didn't find a dinosaur.
608.628	(Laughter)
610.249	Anyway, actually, we know
610.249	that this kind of formation,
613.57	after several studies,
616.127	we know that these kinds of formations
616.127	are living organisms.
619.376	They are bacterial colonies using silica
619.376	to build mineral structures
624.834	resembling stromatolites.
626.788	Stromatolites are some of the oldest
626.788	forms of life that we can find on earth.
631.333	And here in the tepuis,
633.16	the interesting thing is that these
633.16	bacteria colonies have evolved
637.867	in complete isolation
637.867	from the external surface,
642.12	and without being in contact with humans.
644.768	They have never been
644.768	in contact with humans.
647.389	So the implications
647.389	for science are enormous,
650.48	because here you could find,
650.48	for example, microbes
654.506	that could be useful to resolve
654.506	diseases in medicine,
659.482	or you could find even a new kind
659.482	of material with unknown properties.
663.442	And, in fact, we discovered in the cave
663.442	a new mineral structure for science,
667.525	which is rossiantonite,
667.525	a phosphate-sulfate.
671.606	So whatever you find in the cave,
671.606	even a small cricket,
676.344	has evolved in the dark
676.344	in complete isolation.
680.336	And, really, everything that you can feel
680.336	in the cave are real connections
684.613	between the biological
684.613	and the mineralogical world.
688.544	So as we explore this dark continent
694.384	and discover its mineralogical
694.384	and biological diversity and uniqueness,
700.812	we will find probably clues
700.812	about the origin of life on our planet
705.205	and on the relationship
705.205	and evolution of life
708.206	in relationship with the mineral world.
711.216	What seems only a dark, empty environment
715.182	could be in reality a chest of wonders
717.999	full of useful information.
722.102	With a team of Italian, Venezuelan
722.102	and Brazilian speleologists,
725.999	which is called La Venta Teraphosa,
729.214	we will be back soon to Latin America,
731.306	because we want to explore other tepuis
731.306	in the farthest areas of the Amazon.
736.778	There are still very unknown mountains,
739.822	like Marahuaca, which is almost
739.822	3,000 meters high above sea level,
744.54	or Aracà, which is in the upper region
744.54	of Rio Negro in Brazil.
748.663	And we suppose that we could find there
748.663	even bigger cave systems,
753.606	and each one with its own
753.606	undiscovered world.
758.636	Thank you.
759.834	(Applause)
765.312	Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Francesco.
765.312	Give me that to start so we don't forget.
769.073	Francesco, you said we don't need
769.073	to go to Mars to find alien life,
772.935	and indeed, last time we spoke,
772.935	you were in Sardinia
775.884	and you were training European astronauts.
778.151	So what do you, a speleologist,
778.151	tell and teach to the astronauts?
781.649	Francesco Sauro: Yeah, we are --
781.649	it's a program of training
784.456	for not only European, but also NASA,
784.456	Roskosmos, JAXA astronauts, in a cave.
789.381	So they stay in a cave
789.381	for about one week in isolation.
792.933	They have to work together
792.933	in a real, real dangerous environment,
796.837	and it's a real alien environment for them
796.837	because it's unusual.
800.671	It's always dark. They have to do science.
800.671	They have a lot of tasks.
804.999	And it's very similar to a journey to Mars
807.555	or the International Space Station.
809.251	BG: In principle.
809.251	FS: Yes.
810.534	BG: I want to go back
810.534	to one of the pictures
812.635	that was in your slide show,
814.492	and it's just representative
814.492	of the other photos --
816.905	Weren't those photos amazing? Yeah?
819.227	Audience: Yeah!
820.409	(Applause)
824.169	FS: I have to thank the photographers
824.169	from the team La Venta,
827.319	because all of those photos
827.319	are from the photographers.
831.116	BG: You bring, actually, photographers
831.116	with you in the expedition.
834.842	They're professionals,
834.842	they're speleologists and photographers.
837.833	But when I look at these pictures,
837.833	I wonder: there is zero light down there,
842.757	and yet they look incredibly well-exposed.
845.564	How do you take these pictures?
847.076	How do your colleagues,
847.076	the photographers, take these pictures?
850.151	FS: Yeah. They are working
850.151	in a darkroom, basically,
852.666	so you can open the shutter of the camera
854.809	and use the lights
854.809	to paint the environment.
857.251	BG: So you're basically --
858.53	FS: Yes. You can even keep
858.53	the shutter open for one minute
861.289	and then paint the environment.
862.837	The final result is what
862.837	you want to achieve.
865.565	BG: You spray the environment with light
865.565	and that's what you get.
868.662	Maybe we can try this at home
868.662	someday, I don't know.
871.128	(Laughter)
872.156	BG: Francesco, grazie.
872.156	FS: Grazie.
873.771	(Applause)
