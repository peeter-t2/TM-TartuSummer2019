12.973	Good morning.
14.068	My name is Eric Li, and I was born here.
19.094	But no, I wasn't born there.
21.803	This was where I was born:
24.335	Shanghai, at the height
24.335	of the Cultural Revolution.
28.308	My grandmother tells me that she heard
30.142	the sound of gunfire
30.142	along with my first cries.
33.155	When I was growing up, I was told a story
36.91	that explained all I ever
36.91	needed to know about humanity.
40.515	It went like this.
41.954	All human societies develop
41.954	in linear progression,
45.212	beginning with primitive
45.212	society, then slave society,
48.804	feudalism, capitalism, socialism,
51.835	and finally, guess where we end up?
54.179	Communism!
57.303	Sooner or later, all of humanity,
61.015	regardless of culture,
61.015	language, nationality,
63.781	will arrive at this final stage
66.237	of political and social development.
68.67	The entire world's peoples will be unified
70.926	in this paradise on Earth
73.19	and live happily ever after.
75.958	But before we get there, we're engaged
78.245	in a struggle between good and evil,
80.686	the good of socialism
80.686	against the evil of capitalism,
83.827	and the good shall triumph.
85.774	That, of course, was the meta-narrative
88.27	distilled from the theories of Karl Marx.
91.05	And the Chinese bought it.
93.652	We were taught that grand
93.652	story day in and day out.
96.565	It became part of us,
96.565	and we believed in it.
99.338	The story was a bestseller.
101.532	About one third of the entire
101.532	world's population
103.842	lived under that meta-narrative.
106.495	Then, the world changed overnight.
109.262	As for me, disillusioned
109.262	by the failed religion of my youth,
112.908	I went to America and became
112.908	a Berkeley hippie.
115.821	(Laughter)
119.02	Now, as I was coming of age,
119.02	something else happened.
122.736	As if one big story wasn't enough,
124.932	I was told another one.
127.444	This one was just as grand.
130.676	It also claims that all human societies
132.839	develop in a linear progression
132.839	towards a singular end.
136.684	This one went as follows:
139.209	All societies, regardless of culture,
141.565	be it Christian, Muslim, Confucian,
144.255	must progress from traditional societies
146.984	in which groups are the basic units
149.53	to modern societies
149.53	in which atomized individuals
153.031	are the sovereign units,
154.494	and all these individuals
154.494	are, by definition, rational,
158.237	and they all want one thing:
160.303	the vote.
162.803	Because they are all rational,
162.803	once given the vote,
165.463	they produce good government
166.897	and live happily ever after.
169.096	Paradise on Earth, again.
172.015	Sooner or later, electoral
172.015	democracy will be
175.116	the only political system
175.116	for all countries and all peoples,
179.127	with a free market to make them all rich.
181.591	But before we get there,
181.591	we're engaged in a struggle
185.141	between good and evil.
186.834	(Laughter)
188.394	The good belongs to those
188.394	who are democracies
190.632	and are charged with a mission
190.632	of spreading it
192.847	around the globe, sometimes by force,
196.04	against the evil of those
196.04	who do not hold elections.
199.466	(Video) George H.W. Bush:
199.466	A new world order...
201.356	(Video) George W. Bush:...
201.356	ending tyranny in our world...
204.047	(Video) Barack Obama:...
204.047	a single standard for all
206.5	who would hold power.
208.84	Eric X. Li: Now --
210.644	(Laughter) (Applause)
218.325	This story also became a bestseller.
222.348	According to Freedom House,
224.215	the number of democracies
224.215	went from 45 in 1970
227.218	to 115 in 2010.
229.753	In the last 20 years,
229.753	Western elites tirelessly
232.947	trotted around the globe
232.947	selling this prospectus:
236.242	Multiple parties fight for political power
238.857	and everyone voting on them
240.403	is the only path to salvation
242.424	to the long-suffering developing world.
245.191	Those who buy the prospectus
245.191	are destined for success.
248.303	Those who do not are doomed to fail.
251.395	But this time, the Chinese didn't buy it.
254.593	Fool me once...
257.112	(Laughter)
261.681	The rest is history.
263.983	In just 30 years, China went from
265.579	one of the poorest agricultural
265.579	countries in the world
268.175	to its second-largest economy.
270.098	Six hundred fifty million people
272.154	were lifted out of poverty.
273.769	Eighty percent of the entire
273.769	world's poverty alleviation
276.757	during that period happened in China.
278.982	In other words, all the new
278.982	and old democracies
281.631	put together amounted to a mere fraction
284.699	of what a single, one-party
284.699	state did without voting.
289.968	See, I grew up on this stuff: food stamps.
293.146	Meat was rationed to a few hundred grams
295.079	per person per month at one point.
297.671	Needless to say, I ate
297.671	all my grandmother's portions.
301.842	So I asked myself, what's wrong
301.842	with this picture?
305.577	Here I am in my hometown,
307.578	my business growing leaps and bounds.
309.364	Entrepreneurs are starting
309.364	companies every day.
311.663	Middle class is expanding
311.663	in speed and scale
314.744	unprecedented in human history.
316.745	Yet, according to the grand story,
319.282	none of this should be happening.
322.217	So I went and did the only thing I could.
322.217	I studied it.
325.423	Yes, China is a one-party state
327.43	run by the Chinese Communist
327.43	Party, the Party,
331.315	and they don't hold elections.
333.267	Three assumptions are made
335.826	by the dominant political
335.826	theories of our time.
338.48	Such a system is operationally rigid,
341.363	politically closed,
341.363	and morally illegitimate.
345.049	Well, the assumptions are wrong.
348.259	The opposites are true.
350.469	Adaptability, meritocracy, and legitimacy
353.807	are the three defining characteristics
355.741	of China's one-party system.
358.112	Now, most political
358.112	scientists will tell us
360.184	that a one-party system
360.184	is inherently incapable
363.369	of self-correction.
365.297	It won't last long
365.297	because it cannot adapt.
367.615	Now here are the facts.
369.413	In 64 years of running the largest
369.413	country in the world,
372.973	the range of the Party's policies
372.973	has been wider
375.533	than any other country in recent memory,
378.45	from radical land collectivization
378.45	to the Great Leap Forward,
382.421	then privatization of farmland,
385.073	then the Cultural Revolution,
387.369	then Deng Xiaoping's market reform,
390.065	then successor Jiang Zemin
390.065	took the giant political step
393.478	of opening up Party membership
393.478	to private businesspeople,
396.626	something unimaginable during Mao's rule.
399.689	So the Party self-corrects
399.689	in rather dramatic fashions.
403.51	Institutionally, new rules get enacted
406.14	to correct previous dysfunctions.
408.719	For example, term limits.
410.593	Political leaders used to retain
410.593	their positions for life,
413.379	and they used that to accumulate power
415.213	and perpetuate their rules.
416.782	Mao was the father of modern China,
419.002	yet his prolonged rule led
419.002	to disastrous mistakes.
421.874	So the Party instituted term limits
424.034	with mandatory retirement age of 68 to 70.
427.787	One thing we often hear is,
430.036	"""Political reforms have lagged"
430.036	"far behind economic reforms,"""
433.214	"and ""China is in dire need"
433.214	"of political reform."""
436.488	But this claim is a rhetorical trap
439.447	hidden behind a political bias.
442.063	See, some have decided a priori
444.56	what kinds of changes they want to see,
446.442	and only such changes can
446.442	be called political reform.
450.049	The truth is, political
450.049	reforms have never stopped.
453.009	Compared with 30 years ago,
456.242	every aspect of Chinese society,
458.632	how the country is governed,
459.504	from the most local level
459.504	to the highest center,
461.814	are unrecognizable today.
464.237	Now such changes are simply not possible
467.423	without political reforms
467.423	of the most fundamental kind.
471.143	Now I would venture to suggest the Party
473.336	is the world's leading
473.336	expert in political reform.
477.443	The second assumption
477.443	is that in a one-party state,
480.475	power gets concentrated
480.475	in the hands of the few,
483.206	and bad governance and corruption follow.
485.908	Indeed, corruption is a big problem,
488.081	but let's first look
488.081	at the larger context.
490.215	Now, this may be counterintuitive to you.
492.343	The Party happens to be
492.343	one of the most meritocratic
495.362	political institutions in the world today.
498.158	China's highest ruling body,
498.158	the Politburo, has 25 members.
502.259	In the most recent one, only five of them
504.347	came from a background of privilege,
504.347	so-called princelings.
507.969	The other 20, including the president
507.969	and the premier,
510.565	came from entirely ordinary backgrounds.
513.22	In the larger central
513.22	committee of 300 or more,
515.661	the percentage of those who were born
517.528	into power and wealth was even smaller.
519.987	The vast majority
519.987	of senior Chinese leaders
522.817	worked and competed their way to the top.
525.462	Compare that with the ruling elites
527.594	in both developed
527.594	and developing countries,
529.696	I think you'll find the Party
529.696	being near the top
532.206	in upward mobility.
534.84	The question then is,
534.84	how could that be possible
537.369	in a system run by one party?
540.588	Now we come to a powerful
540.588	political institution,
543.48	little-known to Westerners:
544.997	the Party's Organization Department.
547.648	The department functions like a giant
549.848	human resource engine
549.848	that would be the envy
552.224	of even some of the most successful
552.224	corporations.
555.554	It operates a rotating pyramid
557.823	made up of three components:
559.19	civil service, state-owned enterprises,
561.746	and social organizations like a university
563.99	or a community program.
566.128	They form separate
566.128	yet integrated career paths
568.639	for Chinese officials.
570.543	They recruit college grads
570.543	into entry-level positions
573.628	in all three tracks,
573.628	and they start from the bottom,
576.378	"called ""keyuan"" [clerk]."
577.934	Then they could get promoted
579.317	through four increasingly elite ranks:
584.433	fuke [deputy section manager], ke [section manager], fuchu
584.433	[deputy division manager], and chu [division manger].
587.745	Now these are not moves
587.745	"from ""Karate Kid,"" okay?"
590.055	It's serious business.
593.399	The range of positions is wide,
595.736	from running health care in a village
597.522	to foreign investment in a city district
599.583	to manager in a company.
601.708	Once a year, the department
601.708	reviews their performance.
604.304	They interview
604.304	their superiors, their peers,
606.639	their subordinates. They vet
606.639	their personal conduct.
609.42	They conduct public opinion surveys.
611.452	Then they promote the winners.
613.415	Throughout their careers, these cadres
615.249	can move
615.249	through and out of all three tracks.
618.083	Over time, the good ones move
618.083	beyond the four base levels
620.961	to the fuju [deputy bureau chief]
620.961	and ju [bureau chief] levels.
623.985	There, they enter high officialdom.
626.497	By that point, a typical
626.497	assignment will be
628.657	to manage a district
628.657	with a population in the millions
631.516	or a company with hundreds
631.516	of millions of dollars in revenue.
635.047	Just to show you
635.047	how competitive the system is,
638.976	in 2012, there were 900,000
638.976	fuke and ke levels,
645.518	and only 40,000 fuju and ju levels.
648.953	After the ju levels,
650.681	the best few move further
650.681	up several more ranks,
653.282	and eventually make it
653.282	to the Central Committee.
656.413	The process takes two to three decades.
659.165	Does patronage play a role?
659.165	Yes, of course.
662.274	But merit remains the fundamental driver.
665.846	In essence, the Organization
665.846	Department runs
668.376	a modernized version
668.376	of China's centuries-old
670.849	mentoring system.
672.913	China's new president, Xi Jinping,
675.004	is the son of a former leader,
675.004	which is very unusual,
677.583	first of his kind to make the top job.
679.803	Even for him, the career took 30 years.
682.698	He started as a village manager,
684.566	and by the time he entered the Politburo,
686.543	he had managed areas
686.543	with a total population
688.684	of 150 million people
690.288	and combined GDPs of 1.5 trillion U.S.
690.288	dollars.
694.734	Now, please don't get me wrong, okay?
697.054	This is not a put-down of anyone.
697.054	It's just a statement of fact.
700.308	George W. Bush, remember him?
704.142	This is not a put-down.
706.583	(Laughter)
707.388	Before becoming governor of Texas,
710.487	or Barack Obama
710.487	before running for president,
713.106	could not make even a small county manager
715.865	in China's system.
717.793	Winston Churchill once said that democracy
719.817	is a terrible system
719.817	except for all the rest.
722.134	Well, apparently he hadn't heard
722.134	of the Organization Department.
726.415	Now, Westerners always assume that
728.759	multi-party election
728.759	with universal suffrage
731.777	is the only source
731.777	of political legitimacy.
734.919	"I was asked once, ""The Party"
734.919	wasn't voted in by election.
738.281	"Where is the source of legitimacy?"""
740.511	"I said, ""How about competency?"""
744.073	We all know the facts.
745.55	In 1949, when the Party took power,
747.491	China was mired in civil wars,
747.491	dismembered by foreign aggression,
750.818	average life expectancy
750.818	at that time, 41 years old.
755.113	Today, it's the second largest
755.113	economy in the world,
758.023	an industrial powerhouse,
758.023	and its people live
760.626	in increasing prosperity.
762.713	Pew Research polls Chinese
762.713	public attitudes,
765.866	and here are the numbers in recent years.
767.923	Satisfaction with the direction
767.923	of the country: 85 percent.
772.423	Those who think they're better
772.423	off than five years ago:
776.998	Those who expect the future to be better:
779.382	a whopping 82 percent.
782.046	Financial Times polls
782.046	global youth attitudes,
785.575	and these numbers, brand new,
785.575	just came from last week.
788.99	Ninety-three percent
788.99	of China's Generation Y
791.772	are optimistic
791.772	about their country's future.
794.358	Now, if this is not legitimacy,
794.358	I'm not sure what is.
800.246	In contrast, most electoral
800.246	democracies around the world
803.415	are suffering from dismal performance.
805.518	I don't need to elaborate
805.518	for this audience
807.833	how dysfunctional it is,
807.833	from Washington to European capitals.
812.17	With a few exceptions, the vast number
815.059	of developing countries that have
815.059	adopted electoral regimes
817.966	are still suffering
817.966	from poverty and civil strife.
821.777	Governments get elected,
821.777	and then they fall
823.849	below 50 percent approval in a few months
826.452	and stay there and get worse
826.452	until the next election.
830	Democracy is becoming a perpetual cycle
832.423	of elect and regret.
834.801	At this rate, I'm afraid it is democracy,
838.33	not China's one-party
838.33	system, that is in danger
840.95	of losing legitimacy.
843.209	Now, I don't want to create
843.209	the misimpression
846.059	that China's hunky-dory, on the way
848.067	to some kind of superpowerdom.
849.86	The country faces enormous challenges.
852.819	The social and economic problems that come
854.843	with wrenching change
854.843	like this are mind-boggling.
858.728	Pollution is one. Food safety.
858.728	Population issues.
862.275	On the political front, the worst
862.275	problem is corruption.
866.222	Corruption is widespread
866.222	and undermines the system
869.054	and its moral legitimacy.
870.856	But most analysts misdiagnose the disease.
873.703	They say that corruption is the result
873.703	of the one-party system,
876.612	and therefore, in order to cure it,
878.303	you have to do away
878.303	with the entire system.
880.375	But a more careful look
880.375	would tell us otherwise.
883.252	Transparency International ranks China
886.172	between 70 and 80 in recent
886.172	years among 170 countries,
889.938	and it's been moving up.
892.115	India, the largest democracy in the world,
896.325	For the hundred or so countries
896.325	that are ranked below China,
899.207	more than half of them
899.207	are electoral democracies.
901.796	So if election is the panacea
901.796	for corruption,
905.091	how come these countries can't fix it?
908.334	Now, I'm a venture capitalist.
908.334	I make bets.
911.928	It wouldn't be fair
911.928	to end this talk without
914.26	putting myself on the line
914.26	and making some predictions.
916.904	So here they are.
918.609	In the next 10 years, China
918.609	will surpass the U.S.
921.411	and become the largest
921.411	economy in the world.
923.788	Income per capita will be near the top
925.869	of all developing countries.
928.051	Corruption will be curbed,
928.051	but not eliminated,
930.373	and China will move up 10 to 20 notches
932.786	to above 60 in T.I. ranking.
935.628	Economic reform will accelerate,
935.628	political reform will continue,
938.7	and the one-party system will hold firm.
942.056	We live in the dusk of an era.
945.214	Meta-narratives that make universal claims
948.499	failed us in the 20th century
950.46	and are failing us in the 21st.
953.244	Meta-narrative is the cancer
955.838	that is killing democracy from the inside.
958.645	Now, I want to clarify something.
960.412	I'm not here to make
960.412	an indictment of democracy.
962.932	On the contrary, I think
962.932	democracy contributed
965.525	to the rise of the West
965.525	and the creation of the modern world.
968.721	It is the universal claim
968.721	that many Western elites
971.832	are making about their political
971.832	system, the hubris,
975.321	that is at the heart
975.321	of the West's current ills.
978.56	If they would spend
978.56	just a little less time
980.865	on trying to force their way onto others,
983.005	and a little bit more
983.005	on political reform at home,
986.672	they might give their democracy
986.672	a better chance.
990.062	China's political model
990.062	will never supplant
992.44	electoral democracy,
992.44	because unlike the latter,
994.76	it doesn't pretend to be universal.
996.717	It cannot be exported. But
996.717	that is the point precisely.
1000.549	The significance of China's example
1003.148	is not that it provides an alternative,
1005.115	but the demonstration
1005.115	that alternatives exist.
1009.555	Let us draw to a close this
1009.555	era of meta-narratives.
1013.189	Communism and democracy may
1013.189	both be laudable ideals,
1016.552	but the era of their dogmatic
1016.552	universalism is over.
1020.653	Let us stop telling
1020.653	people and our children
1023.14	there's only one way to govern ourselves
1025.392	and a singular future towards which
1027.201	all societies must evolve.
1029.583	It is wrong. It is irresponsible.
1032.378	And worst of all, it is boring.
1036.616	Let universality make way for plurality.
1040.535	Perhaps a more interesting age is upon us.
1043.732	Are we brave enough to welcome it?
1045.944	Thank you.
1047.138	(Applause)
1063.158	Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks.
1066.794	Bruno Giussani: Eric, stay
1066.794	with me for a couple of minutes,
1069	because I want to ask you
1069	a couple of questions.
1071.714	I think many here, and in general
1071.714	in Western countries,
1075.242	would agree with your statement
1075.242	about analysis
1078.644	of democratic systems
1078.644	becoming dysfunctional,
1081.349	but at the same time,
1081.349	many would kind of find
1084.276	unsettling the thought
1084.276	that there is an unelected
1088.221	authority that, without any form
1088.221	of oversight or consultation,
1093.617	decides what the national interest is.
1096.532	What is the mechanism in the Chinese model
1099.534	that allows people to say, actually,
1101.753	the national interest
1101.753	as you defined it is wrong?
1104.34	EXL: You know, Frank Fukuyama,
1104.34	the political scientist,
1108.402	called the Chinese system
1108.402	"""responsive authoritarianism."""
1112.246	It's not exactly right,
1112.246	but I think it comes close.
1115.356	So I know the largest public
1115.356	opinion survey company
1119.33	in China, okay?
1121.212	Do you know who their biggest client is?
1123.892	The Chinese government.
1125.738	Not just from the central government,
1128.204	the city government,
1128.204	the provincial government,
1129.628	to the most local neighborhood districts.
1131.707	They conduct surveys all the time.
1133.85	Are you happy with the garbage collection?
1136.46	Are you happy with the general
1136.46	direction of the country?
1138.572	So there is, in China, there
1138.572	is a different kind of mechanism
1141.833	to be responsive to the demands
1141.833	and the thinking of the people.
1145.394	My point is, I think we should get unstuck
1148.602	from the thinking
1148.602	that there's only one political system --
1151.033	election, election, election --
1152.578	that could make it responsive.
1154.306	I'm not sure, actually, elections produce
1156.29	responsive government
1156.29	anymore in the world.
1159.236	(Applause)
1163.943	BG: Many seem to agree.
1165.103	One of the features of a democratic system
1167.759	is a space for civil
1167.759	society to express itself.
1171.028	And you have shown figures
1171.028	about the support
1173.396	that the government
1173.396	and the authorities have in China.
1176.3	But then you've just
1176.3	mentioned other elements
1179.605	like, you know, big challenges,
1179.605	and there are, of course,
1181.759	a lot of other data that go
1181.759	in a different direction:
1184.685	tens of thousands of unrests and protests
1187.342	and environmental protests, etc.
1190.201	So you seem to suggest the Chinese model
1193.217	doesn't have a space outside of the Party
1195.328	for civil society to express itself.
1197.629	EXL: There's a vibrant
1197.629	civil society in China,
1201.807	whether it's environment or what-have-you.
1203.436	But it's different. You
1203.436	wouldn't recognize it.
1205.684	Because, by Western definitions,
1205.684	a so-called civil society
1208.566	has to be separate or even in opposition
1211.41	to the political system,
1213.101	but that concept is alien
1213.101	for Chinese culture.
1217.866	For thousands of years,
1217.866	you have civil society,
1220.339	yet they are consistent and coherent
1222.828	and part of a political order, and I think
1225.675	it's a big cultural difference.
1229.045	BG: Eric, thank you for sharing
1229.045	this with TED. EXL: Thank you.
