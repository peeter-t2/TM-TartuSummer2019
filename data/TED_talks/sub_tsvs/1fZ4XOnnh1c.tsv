15.26	I'm going to share with you the story
18.26	as to how I have become
20.26	an HIV/AIDS campaigner.
23.26	And this is the name of my campaign: SING Campaign.
27.26	In November of 2003,
29.26	I was invited to take part
31.26	in the launch of Nelson Mandela's
36.26	that is his HIV/AIDS foundation.
38.26	And 46664 is the number
40.26	that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island.
44.26	And that's me with Youssou N'Dour,
46.26	onstage, having the time of my life.
51.26	The next day, all the artists were invited
53.26	to join Mandela in Robben Island,
56.26	where he was going to give a conference
58.26	to the world's press,
61.26	standing in front of his former prison cell.
63.26	You can see the bars of the window there.
66.26	It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us.
69.26	In that moment in time,
71.26	Mandela told the world's press
74.26	that there was a virtual genocide
76.26	taking place in his country;
78.26	that post-apartheid
80.26	Rainbow Nation,
82.26	a thousand people were dying on a daily basis
85.26	and that the front line victims,
87.26	the most vulnerable of all,
89.26	were women and children.
92.26	This was a huge impact on my mind,
95.26	because I am a woman and I am a mother,
98.26	and I hadn't realized
100.26	that the HIV/AIDS pandemic
102.26	was directly affecting women in such a way.
105.26	And so I committed -- when I left South Africa,
107.26	when I left Capetown,
109.26	"I told myself, ""This is going to be something"
111.26	that I have to talk about.
113.26	"I have to serve."""
115.26	And so, subsequently
117.26	I participated in every single
121.26	that I could take part in
123.26	and gave news conferences,
125.26	interviews,
127.26	talking and using my platform as a musician,
130.26	with my commitment to Mandela --
132.26	out of respect for the tremendous,
135.26	unbelievable work that he had done.
137.26	Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela,
140.26	everyone reveres Nelson Mandela.
142.26	But do they all know
144.26	about what has been taking place in South Africa,
146.26	his country,
149.26	the country that had one of the highest incidents
151.26	of transmission of the virus?
153.26	I think that if I went out into the street now
156.26	and I told people what was happening there,
158.26	they would be shocked.
161.26	I was very, very fortunate a couple of years later
164.26	to have met Zackie Achmat,
166.26	the founder of Treatment Action Campaign,
168.26	an incredible campaigner and activist.
171.26	I met him at a 46664 event.
173.26	He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now.
175.26	This is a tool --
177.26	this tells you I am in solidarity
179.26	with people who have HIV,
182.26	people who are living with HIV.
184.26	And in a way because of the stigma, by wearing this t-shirt
187.26	"I say, ""Yes, we can talk about this issue."
190.26	"It doesn't have to be in the closet."""
193.26	I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign
196.26	and I'm very proud to be a member
198.26	of that incredible organization.
200.26	It's a grassroots campaign
202.26	with 80 percent membership being women,
205.26	most of whom are HIV-positive.
208.26	They work in the field.
210.26	They have tremendous outreach
213.26	to the people who are living directly
215.26	with the effects of the virus.
217.26	They have education programs.
220.26	They bring out the issues of stigma.
223.26	It's quite extraordinary what they do.
226.26	And yes, my SING Campaign
228.26	has supported Treatment Action Campaign
230.26	in the way that I have tried to raise awareness
233.26	and to try to also raise funds.
235.26	A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise
237.26	has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign
239.26	and the incredible work that they do,
241.26	and are still continuing to do in South Africa.
244.26	So this is my SING Campaign.
246.26	SING Campaign is basically just me
248.26	and about three or four wonderful people
250.26	who help to support me.
252.26	I've traveled all over the world
254.26	in the last two and a half years --
256.26	I went to about 12 different countries.
258.26	Here I am in Oslo in Norway,
260.26	getting a nice, fat check;
263.26	singing in Hong Kong, trying to get people to raise money.
266.26	In Johannesburg, I had the opportunity to play
269.26	to a mainly white, middle-class South African audience
271.26	who ended up in tears
273.26	because I use film clips
275.26	that really touch the heart, the whole nature,
277.26	of this terrible tragedy that is taking place,
280.26	that people are tending to avoid,
282.26	because they are fatigued,
284.26	and they really don't quite know what the solutions are.
287.26	Aaron Motsoaledi, the current health minister,
289.26	attended that concert
291.26	and I had an opportunity to meet with him,
293.26	and he gave his absolute commitment
295.26	to try to making a change,
297.26	which is absolutely necessary.
299.26	This is in the Scottish Parliament.
301.26	I've subsequently become an envoy
303.26	for Scotland and HIV.
305.26	And I was showing them my experiences
307.26	and trying to, again, raise awareness.
310.26	And once again, in Edinburgh
312.26	with the wonderful African Children's Choir who I simply adore.
315.26	And it's children like this, many of whom have been orphaned
318.26	because of their family being affected
321.26	by the AIDS virus.
323.26	I'm sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe --
326.26	he's the director of UNAIDS.
328.26	And I'm very honored
330.26	by the fact that Michel invited me,
332.26	only a few months ago,
334.26	to become a UNAIDS ambassador.
336.26	And in this way, I've been strengthening my platform
339.26	and broadening my outreach.
341.26	The message that UNAIDS
343.26	are currently sending out to the world
345.26	is that we would like to see the virtual elimination
348.26	of the transmission of the virus
350.26	from mother to child by 2015.
353.26	It's a very ambitious goal
355.26	but we believe it can be achieved with political will.
358.26	This can happen.
360.26	And here I am with a pregnant woman,
362.26	who is HIV positive
364.26	and we're smiling, both of us are smiling, because we're very confident,
367.26	because we know that that young woman
370.26	is receiving treatment
372.26	so her life can be extended
374.26	to take care of the baby she's about to give birth to.
377.26	And her baby will receive PMTCT,
380.26	which will mean that that baby
382.26	can be born free of the virus.
384.26	Now that is prevention
386.26	at the very beginning of life.
388.26	It's one way to start looking at intervention
391.26	with the AIDS pandemic.
393.26	Now, I just would like to finish off
395.26	to tell you the little story
397.26	about Avelile.
399.26	This is Avelile --
401.26	she goes with me wherever I go.
403.26	I tell her story to everyone
405.26	because she represents
407.26	one of millions
409.26	of HIV/AIDS orphans.
411.26	Avelile's mother
413.26	had HIV virus --
415.26	she died
417.26	from AIDS-related illness.
419.26	Avelile had the virus,
421.26	she was born with the virus.
423.26	And here she is at seven years old,
426.26	weighing no more than a one year-old baby.
428.26	At this point in her life,
430.26	she's suffering with full-blown AIDS
432.26	and had pneumonia.
434.26	We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape
437.26	and spent a whole afternoon with her -- an adorable child.
440.26	The doctors and nurses were phenomenal.
442.26	They put her on very special nutritious diet
445.26	and took great care of her.
448.26	And we didn't know when we left the hospital --
450.26	because we filmed her story -- we didn't know if she was going to survive.
453.26	So, it was obviously -- it was a very emotional encounter
456.26	and left us feeling very resonant
458.26	with this direct experience, this one child,
461.26	you know, that story.
463.26	Five months later,
466.26	we went back to South Africa
468.26	to meet Avelile again.
471.26	And I'm getting --
473.26	the hairs on my -- I don't know if you can see the hairs on my arms.
475.26	They're standing up because I know what I'm going to show you.
478.26	This is the transformation that took place.
483.26	Isn't it extraordinary?
485.26	(Applause)
495.26	That round of applause is actually
497.26	for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile.
500.26	And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation.
504.26	So, I would like to say to you,
506.26	each one in the audience,
508.26	if you feel that every mother
511.26	and every child in the world
513.26	has the right to have access
515.26	to good nutrition and good medical care,
518.26	and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals,
521.26	specifically five and six,
523.26	should be absolutely committed to
526.26	by all governments around the world --
528.26	especially in sub-Saharan Africa --
530.26	could you please stand up.
538.26	I think that's fair to say,
540.26	it's almost everyone in the hall.
543.26	Thank you very much.
545.26	(Applause)
