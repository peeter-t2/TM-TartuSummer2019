15.992	Once upon a time, the world was a big, dysfunctional family.
21.161	It was run by the great and powerful parents,
24.592	and the people were helpless
26.927	and hopeless naughty children.
29.423	If any of the more rowdier children questioned
31.926	the authority of the parents, they were scolded.
35.503	If they went exploring into the parents' rooms,
38.536	or even into the secret filing cabinets, they were punished,
42.319	and told that for their own good
45.072	they must never go in there again.
48.703	Then one day, a man came to town
51.199	with boxes and boxes of secret documents
53.997	stolen from the parents' rooms.
55.861	"""Look what they've been hiding from you,"" he said."
59.887	The children looked and were amazed.
62.929	There were maps and minutes from meetings
65.773	where the parents were slagging each other off.
69.038	They behaved just like the children.
71.586	And they made mistakes, too, just like the children.
75.544	The only difference was, their mistakes
78.255	were in the secret filing cabinets.
81.08	Well, there was a girl in the town, and she didn't think
83.885	they should be in the secret filing cabinets,
86.752	or if they were, there ought to be a law
88.652	to allow the children access.
90.769	And so she set about to make it so.
94.576	Well, I'm the girl in that story, and the secret documents
98.422	that I was interested in were located in this building,
101.576	the British Parliament, and the data that I wanted
105.938	to get my hands on were the expense receipts
108.599	of members of Parliament.
112.488	I thought this was a basic question to ask in a democracy. (Applause)
118.727	It wasn't like I was asking for the code to a nuclear bunker,
121.634	or anything like that, but the amount of resistance I got
124.487	from this Freedom of Information request,
127.01	you would have thought I'd asked something like this.
130.254	So I fought for about five years doing this,
134.479	and it was one of many hundreds of requests that I made,
137.951	not -- I didn't -- Hey, look, I didn't set out, honestly,
140.904	to revolutionize the British Parliament.
142.553	That was not my intention. I was just making these requests
145.984	as part of research for my first book.
149.135	But it ended up in this very long, protracted legal battle
152	and there I was after five years fighting against Parliament
156.375	in front of three of Britain's most eminent High Court judges
159.415	waiting for their ruling about whether or not Parliament had to release this data.
163.567	And I've got to tell you, I wasn't that hopeful,
165.675	because I'd seen the establishment. I thought,
168.4	it always sticks together. I am out of luck.
171.756	Well, guess what? I won. Hooray. (Applause)
176.342	Well, that's not exactly the story, because the problem was
179.765	that Parliament delayed and delayed releasing that data,
183.119	and then they tried to retrospectively change the law
186.279	so that it would no longer apply to them.
188.952	The transparency law they'd passed earlier that applied to everybody else,
191.874	they tried to keep it so it didn't apply to them.
194.67	What they hadn't counted on was digitization,
198.165	because that meant that all those paper receipts
200.551	had been scanned in electronically, and it was very easy
203.791	for somebody to just copy that entire database,
206.99	put it on a disk, and then just saunter outside of Parliament,
210.924	which they did, and then they shopped that disk
213.409	to the highest bidder, which was the Daily Telegraph,
216.367	and then, you all remember, there was weeks and weeks
219.574	of revelations, everything from porn movies
222.599	and bath plugs and new kitchens
225.755	and mortgages that had never been paid off.
229.216	The end result was six ministers resigned,
233.903	the first speaker of the house in 300 years was forced to resign,
237.954	a new government was elected on a mandate of transparency,
245.756	and so far, four MPs and two lords
250.247	have done jail time for fraud.
253.277	So, thank you. (Applause)
259.655	Well, I tell you that story because it wasn't unique to Britain.
263.93	It was an example of a culture clash that's happening
267.271	all over the world between bewigged and bestockinged
270.591	officials who think that they can rule over us
274.695	without very much prying from the public,
276.603	and then suddenly confronted with a public
279.056	who is no longer content with that arrangement,
282.494	and not only not content with it, now, more often,
285.732	armed with official data itself.
290.106	So we are moving to this democratization of information,
295.244	and I've been in this field for quite a while.
297.891	Slightly embarrassing admission: Even when I was a kid,
300.532	I used to have these little spy books, and I would, like,
302.467	see what everybody was doing in my neighborhood and log it down.
305.093	I think that was a pretty good indication
307.299	about my future career as an investigative journalist,
310.38	and what I've seen from being in this access to information field for so long
314.9	is that it used to be quite a niche interest,
317.676	and it's gone mainstream. Everybody, increasingly, around the world,
320.827	wants to know about what people in power are doing.
323.995	They want a say in decisions that are made in their name
327.403	and with their money. It's this democratization of information
330.426	that I think is an information enlightenment,
333.132	and it has many of the same principles of the first Enlightenment.
336.595	It's about searching for the truth,
339.59	"not because somebody says it's true, ""because I say so."""
343.787	No, it's about trying to find the truth based on
346.261	what you can see and what can be tested.
348.89	That, in the first Enlightenment, led to questions about
351.558	the right of kings, the divine right of kings to rule over people,
355.067	or that women should be subordinate to men,
357.244	or that the Church was the official word of God.
359.947	Obviously the Church weren't very happy about this,
362.383	and they tried to suppress it,
364.484	but what they hadn't counted on was technology,
367.555	and then they had the printing press, which suddenly
369.98	enabled these ideas to spread cheaply, far and fast,
373.372	and people would come together in coffee houses,
376.212	discuss the ideas, plot revolution.
379.028	In our day, we have digitization. That strips all the physical mass out of information,
383.619	so now it's almost zero cost to copy and share information.
387.024	Our printing press is the Internet. Our coffee houses are social networks.
391.261	We're moving to what I would think of as a fully connected system,
396.363	and we have global decisions to make in this system,
399.236	decisions about climate, about finance systems,
402.922	about resources. And think about it --
406.263	if we want to make an important decision about buying a house,
408.725	we don't just go off. I mean, I don't know about you,
411.239	but I want to see a lot of houses before I put that much money into it.
414.583	And if we're thinking about a finance system,
416.938	we need a lot of information to take in. It's just not possible
420.582	for one person to take in the amount, the volume
424.543	of information, and analyze it to make good decisions.
428.309	So that's why we're seeing increasingly this demand
431.335	for access to information.
433.72	That's why we're starting to see more disclosure laws
436.029	come out, so for example, on the environment,
438.005	there's the Aarhus Convention,
439.721	which is a European directive that gives people
441.749	a very strong right to know, so if your water company
444.497	is dumping water into your river, sewage water
447.867	into your river, you have a right to know about it.
450.915	In the finance industry, you now have more of a right
454.794	to know about what's going on, so we have
457.347	different anti-bribery laws, money regulations,
460.3	increased corporate disclosure, so you can now track assets across borders.
464.373	And it's getting harder to hide assets, tax avoidance,
469.617	pay inequality. So that's great. We're starting to find out
472.752	more and more about these systems.
475.471	And they're all moving to this central system,
478.263	this fully connected system,
480.63	all of them except one. Can you guess which one?
483.837	It's the system which underpins all these other systems.
486.508	It's the system by which we organize and exercise power,
490.666	and there I'm talking about politics, because in politics,
493.596	we're back to this system, this top-down hierarchy.
497.723	And how is it possible that the volume of information
500.804	can be processed that needs to in this system?
503.615	Well, it just can't. That's it.
506.231	And I think this is largely what's behind the crisis
508.938	of legitimacy in our different governments right now.
513.261	So I've told you a bit about what I did
515.444	to try and drag Parliament, kicking and screaming,
518.129	into the 21st century, and I'm just going to give you
520.644	a couple of examples of what a few other people I know
523.308	are doing.
524.528	So this is a guy called Seb Bacon. He's a computer
527.747	programmer, and he built a site called Alaveteli,
531.705	and what it is, it's a Freedom of Information platform.
536.475	It's open-source, with documentation, and it allows you
539.45	to make a Freedom of Information request,
542.553	to ask your public body a question, so
545.522	it takes all the hassle out of it, and I can tell you
548.642	that there is a lot of hassle making these requests,
550.73	so it takes all of that hassle out, and you just type in your question,
554.274	for example, how many police officers have a criminal record?
558.745	It zooms it off to the appropriate person, it tells you
562.586	when the time limit is coming to an end, it keeps track of all
566.074	the correspondence, it posts it up there,
567.726	and it becomes an archive of public knowledge.
571.381	So that's open-source and it can be used in any country
574.954	where there is some kind of Freedom of Information law.
577.865	So there's a list there of the different countries that have it,
581.075	and then there's a few more coming on board.
582.87	So if any of you out there like the sound of that
585.43	and have a law like that in your country,
588.163	I know that Seb would love to hear from you
590.202	about collaborating and getting that into your country.
594.274	This is Birgitta Jónsdóttir. She's an Icelandic MP.
598.569	And quite an unusual MP. In Iceland, she was
602.403	one of the protesters who was outside of Parliament
605.72	when the country's economy collapsed,
609.466	and then she was elected on a reform mandate,
613.36	and she's now spearheading this project.
615.727	It's the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative,
618.614	and they've just got funding to make it an international
620.879	modern media project, and this is taking all of the best laws
624.318	around the world about freedom of expression,
627.254	protection of whistleblowers, protection from libel,
630.049	source protection, and trying to make Iceland a publishing haven.
634.523	It's a place where your data can be free, so when we think
636.944	about, increasingly, how governments want to access user data,
640.359	what they're trying to do in Iceland is make this safe haven
643.131	where it can happen.
645.868	In my own field of investigative journalism, we're also
649.006	having to start thinking globally, so this is a site called
651.836	Investigative Dashboard. And if you're trying to track
654.959	a dictator's assets, for example, Hosni Mubarak,
657.942	you know, he's just funneling out cash from his country
661.387	when he knows he's in trouble, and what you want to do
663.926	to investigate that is, you need to have access to
666.322	all of the world's, as many as you can,
668.621	companies' house registrations databases.
671.404	So this is a website that tries to agglomerate all of those
675.842	databases into one place so you can start searching for,
679.097	you know, his relatives, his friends, the head of his security services.
682.765	You can try and find out how he's moving out assets
685.516	from that country.
688.242	But again, when it comes to the decisions which are
691.875	impacting us the most, perhaps, the most important
694.875	decisions that are being made about war and so forth,
698.164	again we can't just make a Freedom of Information request.
701.093	It's really difficult. So we're still having to rely on
704.201	illegitimate ways of getting information, through leaks.
708.283	So when the Guardian did this investigation about
711.325	the Afghan War, you know, they can't walk into
714.475	the Department of Defense and ask for all the information.
717.939	You know, they're just not going to get it.
719.881	So this came from leaks of tens of thousands of dispatches
723.421	that were written by American soldiers
725.827	about the Afghan War, and leaked,
728.386	and then they're able to do this investigation.
732.037	Another rather large investigation is around world diplomacy.
737.605	Again, this is all based around leaks,
745.356	in this investigation because I got this leak
749.297	through a leak from a disgruntled WikiLeaker
752.666	and ended up going to work at the Guardian.
755.435	So I can tell you firsthand what it was like to have access
757.859	to this leak. It was amazing. I mean, it was amazing.
759.826	"It reminded me of that scene in ""The Wizard of Oz."""
763.476	Do you know the one I mean? Where the little dog Toto
765.964	runs across to where the wizard [is], and he pulls back,
768.815	the dog's pulling back the curtain, and --
770.277	"""Don't look behind the screen. Don't look at the man behind the screen."""
774.26	It was just like that, because what you started to see
776.396	is that all of these grand statesmen, these very pompous
779.347	politicians, they were just like us.
782.445	They all bitched about each other. I mean, quite gossipy,
785.005	those cables. Okay, but I thought it was a very important
787.676	point for all of us to grasp, these are human beings
790.277	just like us. They don't have special powers.
792.228	They're not magic. They are not our parents.
796.051	Beyond that, what I found most fascinating
800.9	was the level of endemic corruption that I saw
803.524	across all different countries, and particularly centered
806.679	around the heart of power, around public officials
809.507	who were embezzling the public's money
812.123	for their own personal enrichment, and allowed to do that
815.141	because of official secrecy.
818.524	So I've mentioned WikiLeaks, because surely what could be
822.151	more open than publishing all the material?
824.982	Because that is what Julian Assange did.
828.053	He wasn't content with the way the newspapers published it
830.621	to be safe and legal. He threw it all out there.
834.418	That did end up with vulnerable people in Afghanistan
838.133	being exposed. It also meant that the Belarussian dictator
841.549	was given a handy list of all the pro-democracy campaigners
845.319	in that country who had spoken to the U.S. government.
848.805	Is that radical openness? I say it's not, because for me,
853.277	what it means, it doesn't mean abdicating power,
856.779	responsibility, accountability, it's actually being a partner
860.533	with power. It's about sharing responsibility,
863.549	sharing accountability. Also, the fact that
866.461	he threatened to sue me because I got a leak of his leaks,
868.598	I thought that showed a remarkable sort of inconsistency
871.283	in ideology, to be honest, as well. (Laughs)
877.124	The other thing is that power is incredibly seductive,
880.458	and you must have two real qualities, I think,
883.126	when you come to the table, when you're dealing
885.539	with power, talking about power,
887.273	because of its seductive capacity.
889.646	You've got to have skepticism and humility.
892.665	Skepticism, because you must always be challenging.
895.258	I want to see why do you -- you just say so? That's not good enough.
898.29	I want to see the evidence behind why that's so.
901.005	And humility because we are all human. We all make mistakes.
905.498	And if you don't have skepticism and humility,
908.29	then it's a really short journey to go from reformer
911.385	"to autocrat, and I think you only have to read ""Animal Farm"""
915.994	to get that message about how power corrupts people.
921.937	So what is the solution? It is, I believe, to embody
927.405	within the rule of law rights to information.
930.872	At the moment our rights are incredibly weak.
933.507	In a lot of countries, we have Official Secrets Acts,
936.489	including in Britain here. We have an Official Secrets Act
938.652	with no public interest test. So that means it's a crime,
941.768	people are punished, quite severely in a lot of cases,
945.934	for publishing or giving away official information.
950.137	Now wouldn't it be amazing, and really, this is what I want
953.615	all of you to think about, if we had an Official Disclosure Act
957.177	where officials were punished if they were found
960.553	to have suppressed or hidden information
963.513	that was in the public interest?
965.698	So that -- yes. Yes! My power pose. (Applause) (Laughs)
972.598	I would like us to work towards that.
975.143	So it's not all bad news. I mean, there definitely is
979.063	progress on the line, but I think what we find is that
982.018	the closer that we get right into the heart of power,
985.194	the more opaque, closed it becomes.
989.618	So it was only just the other week that I heard London's
992.698	Metropolitan Police Commissioner talking about why
996.195	the police need access to all of our communications,
1000.787	spying on us without any judicial oversight,
1003.85	and he said it was a matter of life and death.
1005.516	He actually said that, it was a matter of life and death.
1008.763	There was no evidence. He presented no evidence of that.
1012.985	"It was just, ""Because I say so."
1016.107	"You have to trust me. Take it on faith."""
1019.355	Well, I'm sorry, people, but we are back
1021.354	to the pre-Enlightenment Church,
1025.059	and we need to fight against that.
1028.835	So he was talking about the law in Britain which is
1032.123	the Communications Data Bill, an absolutely outrageous piece of legislation.
1036.349	In America, you have the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act.
1039.955	You've got drones now being considered for domestic surveillance.
1043.595	You have the National Security Agency building
1046.355	the world's giantest spy center. It's just this colossal --
1049.883	it's five times bigger than the U.S. Capitol,
1052.355	in which they're going to intercept and analyze
1054.157	communications, traffic and personal data
1057.106	to try and figure out who's the troublemaker in society.
1060.419	Well, to go back to our original story, the parents
1065.219	have panicked. They've locked all the doors.
1069.069	They've kitted out the house with CCTV cameras.
1072.155	They're watching all of us. They've dug a basement,
1074.907	and they've built a spy center to try and run algorithms
1077.571	and figure out which ones of us are troublesome,
1080.243	and if any of us complain about that, we're arrested for terrorism.
1084.477	Well, is that a fairy tale or a living nightmare?
1088.051	Some fairy tales have happy endings. Some don't.
1091.71	I think we've all read the Grimms' fairy tales, which are,
1094.457	indeed, very grim.
1096.955	But the world isn't a fairy tale, and it could be more brutal
1102.177	than we want to acknowledge.
1104.981	Equally, it could be better than we've been led to believe,
1107.27	but either way, we have to start seeing it exactly as it is,
1110.981	with all of its problems, because it's only by seeing it
1114.83	with all of its problems that we'll be able to fix them
1117.323	and live in a world in which we can all be
1121.394	happily ever after. (Laughs) Thank you very much.
1125.08	(Applause)
1128.315	Thank you. (Applause)
