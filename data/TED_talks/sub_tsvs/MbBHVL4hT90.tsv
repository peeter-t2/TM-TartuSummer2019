13.721	I have a confession to make.
16.181	I am addicted to adventure,
19.42	and as a young boy,
21.859	I would rather look outside the window
24.367	at the birds in the trees and the sky
27.101	than looking at that two-dimensional
29.237	chalky blackboard where time stands still
33.208	and even sometimes dies.
35.953	My teachers thought there was something wrong
37.763	with me because I wasn't paying attention in class.
41.15	They didn't find anything 
41.15	specifically wrong with me,
43.17	other than being slightly 
43.17	dyslexic because I'm a lefty.
47.692	But they didn't test for curiosity.
51.807	Curiosity, to me,
54.388	is about our connection
56.361	with the world, with the universe.
59.606	It's about seeing what's 
59.606	around that next coral head
61.496	or what's around that next tree,
63.195	and learning more not only about our environment
65.254	but about ourselves.
67.324	Now, my dream of dreams,
69.854	I want to go explore the oceans of Mars,
73.128	but until we can go there,
75.974	I think the oceans still hold
79.44	quite a few secrets.
80.879	As a matter of fact,
82.243	if you take our planet as the oasis in space that it is
85.798	and dissect it into a living space,
89.429	the ocean represents over 3.4 billion
92.824	cubic kilometers of volume, within which
95.311	we've explored less than five percent.
99.821	And I look at this, and I go, well,
102.08	there are tools to go 
102.08	deeper, longer and further:
105.446	submarines, ROVs, even Scuba diving.
110.659	But if we're going to explore the final frontier
113.267	on this planet, we need to live there.
116.754	We need to build a log cabin, if you will,
119.352	at the bottom of the sea.
122.412	And so there was a great curiosity in my soul
125.378	when I went to go visit a TED [Prize winner]
128.145	by the name of Dr. Sylvia Earle.
129.58	Maybe you've heard of her.
131.064	Two years ago, she was staked out
134.84	at the last undersea marine laboratory
137.684	to try and save it,
139.667	to try and petition
141.355	for us not to scrap it
143.145	and bring it back on land.
145.546	We've only had about a dozen or so
147.458	scientific labs at the bottom of the sea.
149.888	There's only one left in the world:
151.8	it's nine miles offshore
153.021	and 65 feet down.
155.355	It's called Aquarius.
157.01	Aquarius, in some fashion,
159.382	is a dinosaur,
161.631	an ancient robot chained to the bottom,
163.971	this Leviathan.
167.391	In other ways, it's a legacy.
169.546	And so with that visit, I realized 
169.546	that my time is short
172.43	if I wanted to experience
174.681	what it was like to become an aquanaut.
179.708	When we swam towards this after many
182.194	moons of torture and two years of preparation,
184.94	this habitat waiting to invite us
189.909	was like a new home.
192.925	And the point of going down to
195.12	and living at this habitat was not to stay inside.
198.967	It wasn't about living at something
198.967	the size of a school bus.
201.566	It was about giving us the luxury of time
204.772	outside to wander, to explore,
207.821	to understand more about this oceanic final frontier.
211.704	We had megafauna come and visit us.
214.011	This spotted eagle ray is a fairly
214.011	common sight in the oceans.
217.551	But why this is so important,
220.183	why this picture is up,
221.758	is because this particular animal
221.758	brought his friends around,
225.223	and instead of being the
225.223	pelagic animals that they were,
228.37	they started getting curious about us,
229.76	these new strangers that were
229.76	moving into the neighborhood,
233.749	doing things with plankton.
236.268	We were studying all sorts of animals and critters,
238.97	and they got closer and closer to us,
241.457	and because of the luxury of time,
243.239	these animals, these residents of the coral reef,
245.59	were starting to get used to us,
247.004	and these pelagics that
247.004	normal travel through stopped.
250.681	This particular animal actually circled
253.184	for 31 full days during our mission.
257.335	So mission 31 wasn't so much
259.675	about breaking records.
261.587	It was about that human-ocean connection.
266.021	Because of the luxury of time, we were able
268.175	to study animals such as sharks and grouper
272.134	in aggregations that we've never seen before.
274.384	It's like seeing dogs and 
274.384	cats behaving well together.
278.97	Even being able to commune with animals
280.745	that are much larger than us,
281.872	such as this endangered goliath grouper
284.634	who only still resides in the Florida Keys.
287.896	Of course, just like any neighbor,
290.205	after a while, if they get tired,
292.725	the goliath grouper barks at us,
294.345	and this bark is so powerful
296.141	that it actually stuns its prey before it aspirates it all
298.8	within a split second.
300.769	For us, it's just telling us to go back
302.286	into the habitat and leave them alone.
306.918	Now, this wasn't just about adventure.
310.149	There was actually a serious note to it.
311.978	We did a lot of science, and again,
311.978	because of the luxury of time,
315.279	we were able to do over three years of science
317.845	in 31 days.
320.306	In this particular case, we were using a PAM,
322.522	or, let me just see if I can get this straight,
324.243	a Pulse Amplitude Modulated Fluorometer.
328.262	And our scientists from FIU, MIT,
331.465	and from Northeastern
333.52	were able to get a gauge for what coral reefs do
336.493	when we're not around.
338.181	The Pulse Amplitude Modulated
338.181	Fluorometer, or PAM,
340.734	gauges the fluorescence of corals
343.24	as it pertains to pollutants in the water
345.717	as well as climate change-related issues.
349.103	We used all sorts of other cutting-edge tools,
352.601	such as this sonde, or what I like to call
354.93	the sponge proctologist, whereby the sonde
361.084	itself tests for metabolism rates
363.887	in what in this particular case is a barrel sponge,
366.987	or the redwoods of the [ocean].
369.338	And this gives us a much better gauge
370.61	of what's happening underwater
372.928	with regard to climate change-related issues,
375.863	and how the dynamics of that
377.651	affect us here on land.
380.261	And finally, we looked at predator-prey behavior.
382.743	And predator-prey behavior is an interesting thing,
384.671	because as we take away some of the predators
387.168	on these coral reefs around the world,
389.339	the prey, or the forage fish, act very differently.
392.904	What we realized is
394.558	not only do they stop taking care of the reef,
397.741	darting in, grabbing a little bit of algae
399.665	and going back into their homes,
401.184	they start spreading out and disappearing
403.163	from those particular coral reefs.
405.278	Well, within that 31 days,
407.606	we were able to generate over 10 scientific papers
410.295	on each one of these topics.
413.426	But the point of adventure is not only to learn,
418.132	it's to be able to share that 
418.132	knowledge with the world,
420.525	and with that, thanks to a 
420.525	couple of engineers at MIT,
424.507	we were able to use a prototype
424.507	camera called the Edgertronic
427.84	to capture slow-motion video,
430.901	up to 20,000 frames per second
433.673	in a little box
435.052	that's worth 3,000 dollars.
436.693	It's available to every one of us.
438.937	And that particular camera gives us an insight
441.655	into what fairly common animals do
444.28	but we can't even see it in the blink of an eye.
446.526	Let me show you a quick video
448.836	of what this camera does.
450.906	You can see the silky bubble come out
453.741	of our hard hats.
455.92	It gives us an insight
458.252	into some of the animals that we were sitting
460.613	right next to for 31 days
462.571	and never normally would have paid attention to,
465.28	such as hermit crabs.
467.16	Now, using a cutting-edge piece of technology
470.175	that's not really meant for the oceans
472.3	is not always easy.
474.444	We sometimes had to put the camera upside down,
476.992	cordon it back to the lab,
479.552	and actually man the trigger
482.073	from the lab itself.
484.247	But what this gives us
486.441	is the foresight to look at and analyze
489.275	in scientific and engineering terms
492.482	some of the most amazing behavior
495.646	that the human eye just can't pick up,
496.901	such as this manta shrimp
499.95	trying to catch its prey,
501.718	within about .3 seconds.
507.217	That punch is as strong as a .22 caliber bullet,
510.312	and if you ever try to catch a bullet
511.657	in mid-flight with your eye, impossible.
515.675	But now we can see things
516.978	such as these Christmas tree worms
519.648	pulling in and fanning out
522.809	in a way that the eye just can't capture,
525.845	or in this case,
527.219	a fish throwing up grains of sand.
534.28	This is an actual sailfin goby,
536.67	and if you look at it in real time,
539.186	it actually doesn't even show its fanning motion
542.191	because it's so quick.
545.362	One of the most precious gifts
545.362	that we had underwater
547.634	is that we had WiFi,
549.974	and for 31 days straight we were able to connect
552.19	with the world in real time 
552.19	from the bottom of the sea
554.903	and share all of these experiences.
556.735	Quite literally right there
558.16	I am Skyping in the classroom
559.306	with one of the six continents
561.324	and some of the 70,000 
561.324	students that we connected
564.28	every single day to some of these experiences.
567.07	As a matter of fact, I'm showing a picture that I took
569.333	with my smartphone from underwater
571.977	of a goliath grouper laying on the bottom.
574.508	We had never seen that before.
579.532	And I dream of the day
581.349	that we have underwater cities,
583.844	and maybe, just maybe, if we push the boundaries
586.409	of adventure and knowledge,
588.343	and we share that knowledge with others out there,
591.584	we can solve all sorts of problems.
594.731	My grandfather used to say,
596.189	"""People protect what they love."""
599.142	"My father, ""How can people protect"
601.741	"what they don't understand?"""
606.665	And I've thought about this my whole life.
610.706	Nothing is impossible.
614.014	We need to dream, we need to be creative,
617.197	and we all need to have an adventure
619.57	in order to create miracles in the darkest of times.
623.221	And whether it's about climate change
625.858	or eradicating poverty
628.355	or giving back to future generations
629.998	what we've taken for granted,
632.596	it's about adventure.
634.61	And who knows, maybe
634.61	there will be underwater cities,
637.298	and maybe some of you
638.38	will become the future aquanauts.
640.988	Thank you very much.
642.866	(Applause)
