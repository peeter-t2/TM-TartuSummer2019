15.902	Companies are losing control.
19.062	What happens on Wall Street
20.667	no longer stays on Wall Street.
22.998	What happens in Vegas ends up on YouTube. (Laughter)
26.884	Reputations are volatile. Loyalties are fickle.
31.1	Management teams seem increasingly
33.676	disconnected from their staff. (Laughter)
36.7	A recent survey said that 27 percent of bosses believe
40.225	their employees are inspired by their firm.
42.869	However, in the same survey, only four percent
45.016	of employees agreed.
47.459	Companies are losing control
49.509	of their customers and their employees.
53.151	But are they really?
55.401	I'm a marketer, and as a marketer, I know
58.698	that I've never really been in control.
61.725	Your brand is what other people say about you
64.368	when you're not in the room, the saying goes.
67.563	Hyperconnectivity and transparency allow companies
71.694	to be in that room now, 24/7.
74.575	They can listen and join the conversation.
77.05	In fact, they have more control over the loss of control
80.25	than ever before.
82.64	They can design for it. But how?
85.69	First of all, they can give employees and customers more control.
89.256	They can collaborate with them on the creation of ideas,
92.652	knowledge, content, designs and product.
96.03	They can give them more control over pricing,
98.478	which is what the band Radiohead did
100.438	with its pay-as-you-like online release of its album
103.512	"""In Rainbows."" Buyers could determine the price,"
106.46	but the offer was exclusive, and only stood for a limited period of time.
111.31	The album sold more copies than previous releases of the band.
115.269	The Danish chocolate company Anthon Berg
118.466	"opened a so-called ""generous store"" in Copenhagen."
121.648	It asked customers to purchase chocolate
124.067	with the promise of good deeds towards loved ones.
127.566	It turned transactions into interactions,
130.48	and generosity into a currency.
133.033	Companies can even give control to hackers.
135.994	When Microsoft Kinect came out,
138.445	the motion-controlled add-on to its Xbox gaming console,
142.596	it immediately drew the attention of hackers.
145.532	Microsoft first fought off the hacks, but then shifted course
149.425	when it realized that actively supporting the community
152.288	came with benefits.
154.047	The sense of co-ownership, the free publicity,
157.283	the added value, all helped drive sales.
160.3	The ultimate empowerment of customers
162.629	is to ask them not to buy.
165.722	Outdoor clothier Patagonia encouraged prospective buyers
169.649	to check out eBay for its used products
172.618	and to resole their shoes before purchasing new ones.
176.185	In an even more radical stance against consumerism,
179.423	"the company placed a ""Don't Buy This Jacket"""
181.516	advertisement during the peak of shopping season.
185.016	It may have jeopardized short-term sales,
187.818	but it builds lasting, long-term loyalty
190.472	based on shared values.
192.642	Research has shown that giving employees more control
195.862	over their work makes them happier and more productive.
199.631	The Brazilian company Semco Group famously
202.6	lets employees set their own work schedules
205.27	and even their salaries.
207.282	Hulu and Netflix, among other companies,
209.553	have open vacation policies.
212.005	Companies can give people more control,
214.923	but they can also give them less control.
219.195	Traditional business wisdom holds that trust
221.942	is earned by predictable behavior,
224.651	but when everything is consistent and standardized,
227.296	how do you create meaningful experiences?
230.219	Giving people less control might be a wonderful way
233.686	to counter the abundance of choice
235.948	and make them happier.
237.63	Take the travel service Nextpedition.
240.443	Nextpedition turns the trip into a game,
243.648	with surprising twists and turns along the way.
247.22	It does not tell the traveler where she's going
249.044	until the very last minute, and information is provided
252.113	just in time. Similarly, Dutch airline KLM
256.096	launched a surprise campaign, seemingly randomly
259.281	handing out small gifts to travelers
262.073	en route to their destination.
264.235	U.K.-based Interflora monitored Twitter
267.068	for users who were having a bad day,
269.578	and then sent them a free bouquet of flowers.
273.669	Is there anything companies can do to make
275.682	their employees feel less pressed for time? Yes.
278.789	Force them to help others.
281.714	A recent study suggests that having employees complete
285.048	occasional altruistic tasks throughout the day
287.859	increases their sense of overall productivity.
291.928	At Frog, the company I work for, we hold internal
295.597	speed meet sessions that connect old and new employees,
300.198	helping them get to know each other fast.
303.158	By applying a strict process, we give them less control,
306.48	less choice, but we enable more and richer social interactions.
311.214	Companies are the makers of their fortunes,
314.07	and like all of us, they are utterly exposed to serendipity.
318.333	That should make them more humble, more vulnerable
321.938	and more human.
324.758	At the end of the day, as hyperconnectivity
327.604	and transparency expose companies' behavior
329.914	in broad daylight, staying true to their true selves
333.548	is the only sustainable value proposition.
337.099	Or as the ballet dancer Alonzo King said,
339.744	"""What's interesting about you is you."""
342.754	For the true selves of companies to come through,
345.808	openness is paramount,
348.439	but radical openness is not a solution,
351.431	because when everything is open, nothing is open.
354.841	"""A smile is a door that is half open and half closed,"""
359.758	the author Jennifer Egan wrote.
361.812	Companies can give their employees and customers
364.392	more control or less. They can worry about how much
367.879	openness is good for them, and what needs to stay closed.
371.537	Or they can simply smile, and remain open
375.778	to all possibilities.
377.395	Thank you. (Applause)
381.506	(Applause)
