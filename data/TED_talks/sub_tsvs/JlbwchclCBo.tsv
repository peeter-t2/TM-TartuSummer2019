12.699	Joseph Keller used to jog
12.699	around the Stanford campus,
16.795	and he was struck by all the women
16.795	jogging there as well.
21.536	Why did their ponytails swing
21.536	from side to side like that?
25.687	Being a mathematician,
25.687	he set out to understand why.
28.849	(Laughter)
30.024	Professor Keller was curious
30.024	about many things:
32.354	why teapots dribble
34.345	or how earthworms wriggle.
36.667	Until a few months ago,
36.667	I hadn't heard of Joseph Keller.
40.401	I read about him in the New York Times,
43.277	in the obituaries.
44.733	The Times had half a page
44.733	of editorial dedicated to him,
48.529	which you can imagine is premium space
48.529	for a newspaper of their stature.
53.188	I read the obituaries almost every day.
56.51	My wife understandably thinks
56.51	I'm rather morbid
59.556	to begin my day with scrambled eggs
59.556	"and a ""Let's see who died today."""
63.98	(Laughter)
65.845	But if you think about it,
67.161	the front page of the newspaper
67.161	is usually bad news,
70.598	and cues man's failures.
72.597	An instance where bad news
72.597	cues accomplishment
75.287	is at the end of the paper,
75.287	in the obituaries.
79.225	In my day job,
80.613	I run a company that focuses
80.613	on future insights
83.113	that marketers can derive
83.113	from past data --
85.557	a kind of rearview-mirror analysis.
88.912	And we began to think:
90.091	What if we held a rearview mirror
90.091	to obituaries from the New York Times?
96.334	Were there lessons on how you could get
96.334	your obituary featured --
99.826	even if you aren't around to enjoy it?
101.827	(Laughter)
103.335	Would this go better with scrambled eggs?
105.987	(Laughter)
107.983	And so, we looked at the data.
111.689	2,000 editorial, non-paid obituaries
116.207	over a 20-month period
116.207	between 2015 and 2016.
119.873	What did these 2,000 deaths --
119.873	rather, lives -- teach us?
124.721	Well, first we looked at words.
126.778	This here is an obituary headline.
128.563	This one is of the amazing Lee Kuan Yew.
130.883	If you remove the beginning and the end,
133.429	you're left with a beautifully
133.429	worded descriptor
136.787	that tries to, in just a few words,
136.787	capture an achievement or a lifetime.
141.486	Just looking at these is fascinating.
144.121	Here are a few famous ones,
144.121	people who died in the last two years.
147.44	Try and guess who they are.
148.783	[An Artist who Defied Genre]
150.247	That's Prince.
152.317	[Titan of Boxing and the 20th Century]
154.178	Oh, yes.
155.362	[Muhammad Ali]
156.61	[Groundbreaking Architect]
158.18	Zaha Hadid.
160.663	So we took these descriptors
162.435	and did what's called
162.435	natural language processing,
164.983	where you feed these into a program,
166.778	it throws out the superfluous words --
168.667	"""the,"" ""and,"" -- the kind of words"
168.667	"you can mime easily in ""Charades,"" --"
172.914	and leaves you with the most
172.914	significant words.
175.131	And we did it not just for these four,
176.976	but for all 2,000 descriptors.
179.519	And this is what it looks like.
182.824	Film, theatre, music, dance
182.824	and of course, art, are huge.
188.305	Over 40 percent.
190.275	You have to wonder
190.275	why in so many societies
192.827	we insist that our kids pursue
192.827	engineering or medicine or business or law
197.286	to be construed as successful.
199.691	And while we're talking profession,
201.408	let's look at age --
202.583	the average age at which
202.583	they achieved things.
205.117	That number is 37.
208.094	What that means is,
208.094	you've got to wait 37 years ...
211.774	before your first significant achievement
211.774	that you're remembered for --
215.193	on average --
	die at the age of 81 --
218.87	on average.
220.062	(Laughter)
221.087	Talk about having to be patient.
222.795	(Laughter)
223.876	Of course, it varies by profession.
226.386	If you're a sports star,
227.603	you'll probably hit
227.603	your stride in your 20s.
229.754	And if you're in your 40s like me,
232.423	you can join the fun world of politics.
234.438	(Laughter)
235.518	Politicians do their first and sometimes
235.518	only commendable act in their mid-40s.
239.457	(Laughter)
240.738	"If you're wondering what ""others"" are,"
242.699	here are some examples.
244.641	Isn't it fascinating, the things people do
246.781	and the things they're remembered for?
248.687	(Laughter)
251.956	Our curiosity was in overdrive,
253.824	and we desired to analyze
253.824	more than just a descriptor.
258.818	So, we ingested the entire
258.818	first paragraph of all 2,000 obituaries,
263.788	but we did this separately
263.788	for two groups of people:
266.586	people that are famous
266.586	and people that are not famous.
269.387	Famous people -- Prince,
269.387	Ali, Zaha Hadid --
272.1	people who are not famous
272.1	are people like Jocelyn Cooper,
276.359	Reverend Curry
277.537	or Lorna Kelly.
278.73	I'm willing to bet you haven't heard
278.73	of most of their names.
281.942	Amazing people, fantastic achievements,
281.942	but they're not famous.
286.54	So what if we analyze
286.54	these two groups separately --
289.352	the famous and the non-famous?
290.901	What might that tell us?
292.344	Take a look.
296.376	Two things leap out at me.
298.389	First:
299.926	"""John."""
301.148	(Laughter)
303.734	Anyone here named John
303.734	should thank your parents --
307.146	(Laughter)
308.499	and remind your kids to cut out
308.499	your obituary when you're gone.
312.881	And second:
315.669	"""help."""
318.344	We uncovered, many lessons
318.344	from lives well-led,
321.833	and what those people immortalized
321.833	in print could teach us.
324.693	The exercise was a fascinating testament
324.693	to the kaleidoscope that is life,
329.455	and even more fascinating
332.194	was the fact that the overwhelming
332.194	majority of obituaries
335.286	featured people famous and non-famous,
338.308	who did seemingly extraordinary things.
341.394	They made a positive dent
341.394	in the fabric of life.
344.528	They helped.
346.592	So ask yourselves as you go
346.592	back to your daily lives:
349.207	How am I using my talents to help society?
352.151	Because the most powerful lesson here is,
355.148	if more people lived their lives
355.148	trying to be famous in death,
359.508	the world would be a much better place.
362.882	Thank you.
364.075	(Applause)
