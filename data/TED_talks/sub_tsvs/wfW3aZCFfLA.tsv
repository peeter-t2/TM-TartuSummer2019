12.481	As a matter of fact,
14.015	I was trying to think about my career
14.015	since I left the White House,
17.287	and the best example I have is a cartoon
17.287	in The New Yorker a couple of years ago.
21.583	This little boy is looking up
21.583	at his father,
23.742	"and he says, ""Daddy, when I grow up,"
23.742	"I want to be a former president."""
27.787	(Laughter)
29.477	Well, I have had a great blessing
29.477	as a former president,
33.193	because I have had an access
35.62	that very few other people
35.62	in the world have ever had
38.277	to get to know so many people
38.277	around this whole universe.
41.923	Not only am I familiar
41.923	with the 50 states in the United States,
45.545	but also my wife and I have visited
45.545	more than 145 countries in the world,
50.421	and the Carter Center has had full-time
50.421	programs in 80 nations on Earth.
54.67	And a lot of times,
54.67	when we go into a country,
56.866	we not only the meet
56.866	the king or the president,
59.076	but we also meet the villagers who live
59.076	in the most remote areas of Africa.
63.424	So our overall commitment
63.424	at the Carter Center
66.93	is to promote human rights,
68.927	and knowing the world as I do,
68.927	I can tell you without any equivocation
73.639	that the number one abuse
73.639	of human rights on Earth
77.53	is, strangely, not addressed quite often,
77.53	is the abuse of women and girls.
83.369	(Applause)
86.657	There are a couple of reasons for this
86.657	that I'll mention to begin with.
91.89	First of all is the misinterpretation
91.89	of religious scriptures, holy scriptures,
97.36	in the Bible, Old Testament,
97.36	New Testament, Quran and so forth,
100.983	and these have been misinterpreted by men
100.983	who are now in the ascendant positions
108.246	in the synagogues and the churches
108.246	and in the mosques.
110.875	And they interpret these rules
110.875	to make sure that women
114.706	are ordinarily relegated
114.706	to a secondary position
118.96	compared to men in the eyes of God.
122.558	This is a very serious problem.
122.558	It's ordinarily not addressed.
126.78	A number of years ago, in the year 2000,
128.891	I had been a Baptist,
128.891	a Southern Baptist for 70 years --
132.454	I tell you, I still teach
132.454	Sunday school every Sunday;
134.936	I'll be teaching this Sunday as well --
136.807	but the Southern Baptist Convention
136.807	in the year 2000 decided
141.222	that women should play
141.222	a secondary position,
143.823	a subservient position to men.
145.889	So they issued an edict, in effect,
148.606	that prevents women from being priests,
148.606	pastors, deacons in the church,
154.51	or chaplains in the military,
156.802	and if a woman teaches a classroom
159.96	in a Southern Baptist seminary,
162.142	they cannot teach if a boy is in the room,
165.555	because you can find verses in the Bible,
167.576	there's over 30,000 verses in the Bible,
170.6	that say that a woman shouldn't
170.6	teach a man, and so forth.
173.41	But the basic thing is the scriptures
173.41	are misinterpreted
176.445	to keep men in an ascendant position.
178.906	That is an all-pervasive problem,
180.996	because men can exert that power
185.872	and if an abusive husband or an employer,
185.872	for instance, wants to cheat women,
191.886	they can say that if women
191.886	are not equal in the eyes of God,
195.67	why should I treat them as equals myself?
197.862	Why should I pay them equal pay
197.862	for doing the same kind of work?
202.32	The other very serious blight
204.247	that causes this problem
204.247	is the excessive resort to violence,
208.264	and that is increasing
208.264	tremendously around the world.
212.858	In the United States of America,
212.858	for instance, we have had
215.787	an enormous increase
215.787	in abuse of poor people,
219.967	mostly black people and minorities,
219.967	by putting them in prison.
225.261	When I was in office
225.261	as governor of Georgia,
227.815	one out of every 1,000 Americans
227.815	were in prison.
231.181	Nowadays, 7.3 people
231.181	per 1,000 are in prison.
236.29	That's a sevenfold increase.
238.31	And since I left the White House,
239.958	there's been an 800 percent increase
239.958	in the number of women
243.279	who are black who are in prison.
245.856	We also have
245.856	[one of the only countries] on Earth
248.38	that still has the death penalty
248.38	that is a developed country.
252.334	And we rank right alongside
252.334	the countries that are most abusive
255.701	in all elements of human rights
255.701	in encouraging the death penalty.
259.555	We're in California now,
259.555	and I figured out the other day
262.411	that California has spent
262.411	four billion dollars
265.406	in convicting 13 people
265.406	for the death penalty.
269.818	If you add that up, that's 307 million
269.818	dollars it costs California
274.653	to send a person to be executed.
277.991	Nebraska this week just passed a law
277.991	abolishing the death penalty,
281.474	because it costs so much. (Applause)
286.861	So the resort to violence and abuse
286.861	of poor people and helpless people
291.087	is another cause of the increase
291.087	in abuse of women.
295.475	Let me just go down a very few
295.475	abuses of women that concern me most,
299.979	and I'll be fairly brief, because I have
299.979	a limited amount of time, as you know.
303.88	One is genital mutilation.
308.36	Genital mutilation is horrible
308.36	and not known by American women,
312.474	but in some countries, many countries,
316.219	when a child is born that's a girl,
316.219	very soon in her life,
320.525	her genitals are completely cut away
320.525	by a so-called cutter
327.235	who has a razor blade and,
327.235	in a non-sterilized way,
331.227	they remove the exterior parts
331.227	of a woman's genitalia.
335.17	And sometimes, in more extreme cases
335.17	but not very rare cases,
339.591	they sew the orifice up so the girl
339.591	can just urinate or menstruate.
343.405	And then later, when she gets married,
343.405	the same cutter goes in
346.784	and opens the orifice up
346.784	so she can have sex.
349.4	This is not a rare thing, although
349.4	it's against the law in most countries.
353.415	In Egypt, for instance,
	that live in Egypt today
359	have been sexually mutilated in that way.
361.56	In some countries,
361.56	it's more than 98 percent
364.95	of the women are cut that way
364.95	before they reach maturity.
369.246	This is a horrible affliction
371.846	on all women that live in those countries.
375.515	Another very serious thing
375.515	is honor killings,
379.299	where a family with misinterpretation,
379.299	again, of a holy scripture --
382.625	there's nothing in the Quran
382.625	that mandates this --
385.313	will execute a girl in their family
389.5	if she is raped
391.377	or if she marries a man
391.377	that her father does not approve,
395.112	or sometimes even if she
395.112	wears inappropriate clothing.
398.223	And this is done by members
398.223	of her own family,
401.251	so the family becomes murderers
403.456	when the girl brings
403.456	so-called disgrace to the family.
407.808	An analysis was done in Egypt
407.808	not so long ago by the United Nations
411.155	and it showed that 75 percent
411.155	of these murders of a girl
415.197	are perpetrated by the father,
415.197	the uncle or the brother,
420.58	but 25 percent of the murders
420.58	are conducted by women.
424.032	Another problem that we have in the world
425.994	that relates to women
425.994	particularly is slavery,
428.732	or human trafficking it's called nowadays.
431.147	There were about 12.5 million people
431.147	sold from Africa into slavery
435.565	in the New World back in
435.565	the 19th century and the 18th century.
439.784	There are 30 million people
439.784	now living in slavery.
443.639	The United States Department of State
443.639	now has a mandate from Congress
449.281	to give a report every year,
451.603	and the State Department reports
451.603	that 800,000 people are sold
456.246	across international borders
456.246	every year into slavery,
459.893	and that 80 percent
459.893	of those sold are women,
462.841	into sexual slavery.
464.977	In the United States right this moment,
	in human bondage, or slavery.
471.385	Atlanta, Georgia, where
471.385	the Carter Center is located
474.171	and where I teach at Emory University,
476.772	they have between 200 and 300 women,
476.772	people sold into slavery every month.
482.672	It's the number one place
482.672	in the nation because of that.
485.781	Atlanta has the busiest
485.781	airport in the world,
487.987	and they also have a lot of passengers
487.987	that come from the Southern Hemisphere.
493.234	If a brothel owner
495.858	wants to buy a girl
495.858	that has brown or black skin,
498.877	they can do it for 1,000 dollars.
501.523	A white-skinned girl brings
501.523	several times more than that,
505.61	and the average brothel owner in Atlanta
505.61	and in the United States now
509	can earn about $35,000 per slave.
513.504	The sex trade in Atlanta, Georgia, exceeds
513.504	the total drug trade in Atlanta, Georgia.
518.613	So this is another very serious problem,
518.613	and the basic problem is prostitution,
523.465	because there's not
523.465	a whorehouse in America
527.459	that's not known by the local officials,
529.688	the local policemen, or the chief
529.688	of police or the mayor and so forth.
533.659	And this leads to one
533.659	of the worst problems,
536.386	and that is that women are bought
536.386	increasingly and put into sexual slavery
540.635	in all countries in the world.
542.586	Sweden has got a good approach to it.
545.14	About 15 to 20 years ago, Sweden
545.14	decided to change the law,
548.762	and women are no longer prosecuted
551.316	if they are in sexual slavery,
554.1	but the brothel owners and the pimps
554.1	and the male customers are prosecuted,
559.675	and -- (Applause) --
559.675	prostitution has gone down.
564.463	In the United States, we take
564.463	just the opposite position.
567.477	For every male arrested
567.477	for illegal sex trade,
	in the United States of America.
579.12	Canada, Ireland, I've already said Sweden,
583.23	France, and other countries are moving now
583.23	towards this so-called Swedish model.
587.15	That's another thing that can be done.
589.309	We have two great institutions
589.309	in this country that all of us admire:
592.68	our military and our great
592.68	university system.
596.511	In the military, they are now analyzing
596.511	how many sexual assaults take place.
600.83	The last report I got,
600.83	there were 26,000 sexual assaults
605.219	that took place in the military --
609.21	Only 3,000, not much more than 1 percent,
609.21	are actually prosecuted,
614.42	and the reason is that the commanding
614.42	officer of any organization --
618.59	a ship like my submarine,
618.59	or a battalion in the Army
622.842	or a company in the Marines --
624.978	the commanding officer
624.978	has the right under law to decide
629.103	whether to prosecute a rapist or not,
631.688	and of course, the last thing they want
631.688	is for anybody to know
634.869	that under their command,
634.869	sexual assaults are taking place,
638.306	so they do not do it.
640.21	That law needs to be changed.
643.472	About one out of four girls
643.472	who enter American universities
646.664	will be sexually assaulted
646.664	before she graduates,
649.451	and this is now getting
649.451	a lot of publicity,
651.737	partially because of my book,
651.737	but other things,
653.943	and so 89 universities in America
653.943	are now condemned
658.131	by the Department of Education
658.131	under Title IX
660.816	because the officials of the universities
660.816	are not taking care of the women
665.529	to protect them from sexual assault.
667.48	The Department of Justice says
667.48	that more than half of the rapes
671.148	on a college campus
671.148	take place by serial rapists,
674.631	because outside of the university system,
677.209	if they rape somebody,
677.209	they'll be prosecuted,
680.227	but when they get on a university campus,
680.227	they can rape with impunity.
684.255	They're not prosecuted.
686.298	Those are the kinds of things
686.298	that go on in our society.
689.642	Another thing that's very serious
689.642	about the abuse of women and girls
695.214	is the lack of equal pay for equal work,
700.207	as you know. (Applause)
702.296	And this is sometimes misinterpreted,
702.296	but for full-time employment,
709.133	a woman in the United States now
709.133	gets 23 percent less than a man.
712.48	When I became president,
712.48	the difference was 39 percent.
715.369	So we've made some progress,
715.369	partially because I was president
719.246	and so forth -- (Applause) (Laughter) --
725.16	but in the last 15 years,
725.16	there's been no progress made,
728.568	so it's been just about 23
728.568	or 24 percent difference
731.424	for the last 15 years.
733.699	These are the kind of things that go on.
735.627	If you take the Fortune 500 companies,
741.849	out of 500,
743.66	and those CEOs, I need not tell you,
746.795	make less on an average
748.792	than the other CEOs.
751.91	Well, that's what goes on in our country.
754.388	Another problem with the United States
756.872	is we are the most warlike
756.872	nation on Earth.
760.564	We have been to war
760.564	with about 25 different countries
764.79	since the Second World War.
767.251	Sometimes, we've had soldiers
767.251	on the ground fighting.
769.782	The other times,
769.782	we've been flying overhead
771.802	dropping bombs on people.
773.775	Other times, of course, now, we have
773.775	drones that attack people and so forth.
777.537	We've been at war
777.537	with 25 different countries
780.21	or more since the Second World War.
782.993	There was four years,
782.993	I won't say which ones,
785.37	where we didn't --
786.964	(Applause) -- we didn't drop a bomb,
786.964	we didn't launch a missile,
792.722	we didn't fire a bullet.
794.464	But anyway, those kinds of things,
794.464	the resort to violence
798.86	and the misinterpretation
798.86	of the holy scriptures
801.476	are what causes, are the basic causes,
801.476	of abuse of women and girls.
806.77	There's one more basic cause
806.77	that I need not mention,
810.369	and that is that in general,
810.369	men don't give a damn.
815.71	(Applause)
815.71	That's true.
818.751	The average man that might say,
818.751	I'm against the abuse of women and girls
823.777	quietly accepts the privileged
823.777	position that we occupy,
828.13	and this is very similar
828.13	to what I knew when I was a child,
831.57	when separate but equal had existed.
833.797	Racial discrimination, legally,
833.797	had existed for 100 years,
839.44	from 1865 at the end of the War
839.44	Between the States, the Civil War,
842.573	all the way up to the 1960s,
845.417	when Lyndon Johnson got the bills passed
848.134	for equal rights.
850.107	But during that time,
850.107	there were many white people
852.847	that didn't think that
852.847	racial discrimination was okay,
856.214	but they stayed quiet,
858.373	because they enjoyed the privileges
858.373	of better jobs,
863.507	unique access to jury duty,
866.918	better schools, and everything else,
869.169	and that's the same thing
869.169	that exists today,
871.33	because the average man
871.33	really doesn't care.
874.975	"Even though they say, ""I'm against"
874.975	"discrimination against girls and women,"""
881.32	they enjoy a privileged position.
884.77	And it's very difficult to get
884.77	the majority of men
887.142	who control the university system,
890.188	the majority of men that control
890.188	the military system,
892.852	the majority of men that control
892.852	the governments of the world,
896.35	and the majority of men that control
896.35	the great religions.
901.584	So what is the basic thing
901.584	that we need to do today?
904.997	I would say the best thing
904.997	that we could do today
907.528	is for the women in the powerful nations
911.84	like this one, and where you come from,
914.563	Europe and so forth, who have influence
914.563	and who have freedom to speak and to act,
919.532	need to take the responsibility
919.532	on yourselves
924.558	to be more forceful in demanding
927.623	an end to racial discrimination
927.623	against girls and women
932.265	all over the world.
933.626	The average woman in Egypt
936.527	doesn't have much to say
936.527	about her daughters
938.693	getting genitally mutilated and so forth.
942.101	I didn't even go down
942.101	to detail about that.
944.175	But I hope that out of this conference,
946.234	that every woman here 
946.234	will get your husbands to realize
950.748	that these abuses on the college campuses
950.748	and the military and so forth
954.872	and in the future job market,
957.411	need to protect your daughters
957.411	and your granddaughters.
961.86	I have 12 grandchildren,
961.86	four children, and 10 great-grandchildren,
967.622	and I think often about them
969.546	and about the plight that they
969.546	will face in America,
972.611	not only if they lived in Egypt
972.611	or a foreign country,
976.396	in having equal rights,
978.602	and I hope that all of you will join me
980.935	in being a champion for women
980.935	and girls around the world
984.662	and protect their human rights.
986.217	Thank you very much.
989.189	(Applause)
