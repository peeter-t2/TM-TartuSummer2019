12.417	In an age of global strife
12.417	and climate change,
15.644	I'm here to answer
15.644	the all important question:
19.13	Why is sex so damn good?
22.225	If you're laughing, you know what I mean.
24.202	Now, before we get to that answer,
26.064	let me tell you about Chris Hosmer.
28.282	Chris is a great friend of mine
28.282	from my university days,
30.973	but secretly, I hate him.
33.837	Here's why. Back in university,
33.837	we had a quick project
36.757	to design some solar-powered clocks.
38.739	Here's my clock.
40.293	It uses something called
40.293	the dwarf sunflower,
42.77	which grows to about 12 inches in height.
45.116	Now, as you know, sunflowers
47.182	track the sun
47.182	during the course of the day.
49.418	So in the morning, you see
49.418	which direction the sunflower is facing,
52.78	and you mark it on the blank
52.78	area in the base.
55.97	At noon, you mark the changed
55.97	position of the sunflower,
58.921	and in the evening again,
58.921	and that's your clock.
62.293	Now, I know my clock doesn't
62.293	tell you the exact time,
64.879	but it does give you a general
64.879	idea using a flower.
67.607	So, in my completely unbiased,
67.607	subjective opinion,
70.723	it's brilliant.
72.442	However, here's Chris's clock.
75.268	It's five magnifying glasses
75.268	with a shot glass under each one.
79.319	In each shot glass
79.319	is a different scented oil.
82.24	In the morning, the sunlight
82.24	will shine down
83.759	on the first magnifying glass,
85.418	focusing a beam of light
85.418	on the shot glass underneath.
88.448	This will warm up the scented oil inside,
90.647	and a particular smell will be emitted.
93.231	A couple of hours later,
93.231	the sun will shine
95.303	on the next magnifying glass,
95.303	and a different smell will be emitted.
98.6	So during the course of the day,
98.6	five different smells
101.281	are dispersed throughout that environment.
103.316	Anyone living in that house
103.316	can tell the time
106.056	just by the smell.
108.528	You can see why I hate Chris.
110.881	I thought my idea was pretty good,
112.525	but his idea is genius,
114.916	and at the time, I knew
114.916	his idea was better than mine,
117.537	but I just couldn't explain why.
120.359	One thing you have to know
120.359	about me is I hate to lose.
123.889	This problem's been bugging me
123.889	for well over a decade.
127.751	All right, let's get back
127.751	to the question of why sex is so good.
131.111	Many years after the solar
131.111	powered clocks project,
133.972	a young lady I knew suggested
133.972	maybe sex is so good
137.676	because of the five senses.
139.616	And when she said this, I had an epiphany.
142.425	So I decided to evaluate different
142.425	experiences I had in my life
146.156	from the point of view of the five senses.
148.644	To do this, I devised something
148.644	called the five senses graph.
152.354	Along the y-axis, you have
152.354	a scale from zero to 10,
155.439	and along the x-axis, you have,
155.439	of course, the five senses.
158.786	Anytime I had a memorable
158.786	experience in my life,
161.37	I would record it on this graph
161.37	like a five senses diary.
165.365	Here's a quick video
165.365	to show you how it works.
168.557	(Video) Jinsop Lee: Hey, my name's Jinsop,
171.373	and today, I'm going to show
171.373	you what riding motorbikes
174.017	is like from the point of view
174.017	of the five senses. Hey!
177.302	Bike designer: This is [unclear],
177.302	custom bike designer.
180.908	(Motorcyle revving)
186.731	[Sound]
207.119	[Touch]
216.75	[Sight]
227.686	[Smell]
235.301	[Taste]
241.037	JL: And that's how the five senses
241.037	graph works.
243.962	Now, for a period of three years,
243.962	I gathered data,
247.311	not just me but also some of my friends,
250.067	and I used to teach
250.067	in university, so I forced my --
252.568	I mean, I asked my students
252.568	to do this as well.
255.253	So here are some other results.
257.883	The first is for instant noodles.
260.12	Now obviously, taste
260.12	and smell are quite high,
263.18	but notice sound is at three.
267.299	Many people told me a big part
268.875	of the noodle-eating experience
268.875	is the slurping noise.
271.897	You know. (Slurps)
274.279	Needless to say, I no longer
274.279	dine with these people.
277.098	OK, next, clubbing.
279.435	OK, here what I found interesting was
283.156	that taste is at four,
283.156	and many respondents told me
287.825	it's because of the taste of drinks,
289.564	but also, in some cases, kissing is a big
289.564	part of the clubbing experience.
293.985	These people I still do hang out with.
296.793	All right, and smoking.
299.137	Here I found touch is at [six],
299.137	and one of the reasons
304.184	is that smokers told me the sensation
304.184	of holding a cigarette
307.54	and bringing it up to your lips is a big
307.54	part of the smoking experience,
311.237	which shows, it's kind of scary to think
313.916	how well cigarettes are designed
313.916	by the manufacturers.
317.126	OK. Now, what would the perfect
317.126	experience
320.507	look like on the five senses graph?
322.986	It would, of course, be
322.986	a horizontal line along the top.
326.507	Now you can see, not
326.507	even as intense an experience
329.087	as riding a motorbike comes close.
331.32	In fact, in the years
331.32	that I gathered data,
333.862	only one experience came close
333.862	to being the perfect one.
337.1	That is, of course, sex. Great sex.
340.725	Respondents said that great sex
342.414	hits all of the five senses
342.414	at an extreme level.
346.269	Here I'll quote
346.269	one of my students who said,
348.389	"""Sex is so good, it's good"
348.389	"even when it's bad."""
352.626	So the five senses
352.626	theory does help explain
355.939	why sex is so good.
358.056	Now in the middle of all this
358.056	five senses work,
360.905	I suddenly remembered
360.905	the solar-powered clocks project
363.714	from my youth.
364.791	And I realized this theory
364.791	also explains why Chris's clock
367.783	is so much better than mine.
369.664	You see, my clock only focuses on sight,
372.793	and a little bit of touch.
375.231	Here's Chris's clock.
377.214	It's the first clock ever
377.214	that uses smell to tell the time.
381.863	In fact, in terms of the five senses,
383.929	Chris's clock is a revolution.
386.942	And that's what this theory
386.942	taught me about my field.
389.58	You see, up till now, us designers,
391.479	we've mainly focused on making
391.479	things look very pretty,
394.485	and a little bit of touch,
396.281	which means we've ignored
396.281	the other three senses.
399.46	Chris's clock shows us
399.46	that even raising just one
401.93	of those other senses can
401.93	make for a brilliant product.
405.33	So what if we started using
405.33	the five senses theory
409.361	in all of our designs?
410.596	Here's three quick ideas I came up with.
413.321	This is an iron, you
413.321	know, for your clothes,
415.924	to which I added a spraying mechanism,
418.693	so you fill up the vial
418.693	with your favorite scent,
421.244	and your clothes will smell nicer,
423.112	but hopefully it should also make
424.708	the ironing experience more enjoyable.
426.716	"We could call this ""the perfumator."""
429.888	All right, next.
431.373	So I brush my teeth twice a day,
433.416	and what if we had a toothbrush
435.822	that tastes like candy,
437.518	and when the taste of candy ran out,
439.993	you'd know it's time
439.993	to change your toothbrush?
442.953	Finally, I have a thing for the keys
442.953	on a flute or a clarinet.
447.532	It's not just the way they look,
447.532	but I love the way they feel
450.958	when you press down on them.
453.188	Now, I don't play the flute
453.188	or the clarinet,
455.328	so I decided to combine these keys
455.328	with an instrument I do play:
459.464	the television remote control.
462.675	Now, when we look at these
462.675	three ideas together,
465.967	you'll notice that the five senses theory
468.887	doesn't only change the way
468.887	we use these products
471.891	but also the way they look.
474.71	So in conclusion, I've found
474.71	the five senses theory
478.762	to be a very useful tool in evaluating
481.323	different experiences in my life,
482.919	and then taking those best experiences
485.867	and hopefully incorporating
485.867	them into my designs.
488.515	Now, I realize the five senses
488.515	isn't the only thing
492.432	that makes life interesting.
494.35	There's also the six emotions
496.569	and that elusive x-factor.
500.133	Maybe that could be
500.133	the topic of my next talk.
503.883	Until then, please have fun
506.292	using the five senses in your own lives
508.691	and your own designs.
510.411	Oh, one last thing before I leave.
513.196	Here's the experience you
513.196	all had while listening
515.506	to the TED Talks.
516.755	However, it would be better
516.755	if we could boost up
519.067	a couple of the other senses
519.067	like smell and taste.
522.731	And the best way to do that is with
525.783	free candy.
527.436	You guys ready?
529.179	All right.
532.504	(Applause)
