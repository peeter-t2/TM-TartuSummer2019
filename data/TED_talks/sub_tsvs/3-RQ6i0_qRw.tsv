25	I've actually been waiting by the phone
28	for a call from TED for years.
31	And in fact, in 2000, I was ready to talk about eBay, but no call.
37	In 2003, I was ready to do a talk
40	about the Skoll Foundation and social entrepreneurship. No call.
47	In 2004, I started Participant Productions
49	and we had a really good first year, and no call.
52	And finally, I get a call last year,
56	and then I have to go up after J.J. Abrams.
58	(Laughter)
61	You've got a cruel sense of humor, TED.
62	(Laughter)
64	When I first moved to Hollywood from Silicon Valley,
68	I had some misgivings.
69	But I found that there were some advantages to being in Hollywood.
73	(Laughter)
74	And, in fact, some advantages to owning your own media company.
81	And I also found that Hollywood and Silicon Valley
83	have a lot more in common than I would have dreamed.
86	Hollywood has its sex symbols, and the Valley has its sex symbols.
89	(Laughter)
91	Hollywood has its rivalries, and the Valley has its rivalries.
95	Hollywood gathers around power tables,
97	and the Valley gathers around power tables.
99	So it turned out there was a lot more in common
101	than I would have dreamed.
103	But I'm actually here today to tell a story.
106	And part of it is a personal story. When Chris invited me to speak,
111	he said, people think of you as a bit of an enigma,
113	and they want to know what drives you a bit.
116	And what really drives me is a vision of the future
119	that I think we all share.
120	It's a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability.
124	And when we heard a lot of the presentations
129	over the last couple of days,
130	Ed Wilson and the pictures of James Nachtwey,
134	I think we all realized how far we have to go
136	to get to this new version of humanity
137	"that I like to call ""Humanity 2.0."""
140	And it's also something that resides in each of us,
145	to close what I think
146	are the two big calamities in the world today.
150	One is the gap in opportunity --
153	this gap that President Clinton last night
156	called uneven, unfair and unsustainable --
159	and, out of that, comes poverty and illiteracy and disease
162	and all these evils that we see around us.
165	But perhaps the other, bigger gap is what we call the hope gap.
170	And someone, at some point, came up with this very bad idea
173	that an ordinary individual couldn't make a difference in the world.
177	And I think that's just a horrible thing.
179	And so chapter one really begins today, with all of us,
183	because within each of us is the power to
187	equal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps.
190	And if the men and women of TED
192	can't make a difference in the world, I don't know who can.
195	And for me, a lot of this started when I was younger
198	and my family used to go camping in upstate New York.
202	And there really wasn't much to do there for the summer,
204	except get beaten up by my sister or read books.
208	And so I used to read authors like James Michener
211	and James Clavell and Ayn Rand.
213	And their stories made the world seem a very small
217	and interconnected place.
219	And it struck me that if I could write stories
223	that were about this world as being small and interconnected,
225	that maybe I could get people interested in the issues
229	that affected us all, and maybe engage them to make a difference.
233	I didn't think that was necessarily the best way to make a living,
237	so I decided to go on a path to become financially independent,
241	so I could write these stories as quickly as I could.
245	I then had a bit of a wake-up call when I was 14.
248	And my dad came home one day
250	and announced that he had cancer, and it looked pretty bad.
254	And what he said was, he wasn't so much afraid that he might die,
258	but that he hadn't done the things that he wanted to with his life.
263	And knock on wood, he's still alive today, many years later.
267	But for a young man that made a real impression on me,
270	that one never knows how much time one really has.
273	So I set out in a hurry. I studied engineering.
278	I started a couple of businesses
280	that I thought would be the ticket to financial freedom.
283	One of those businesses was a computer rental business
286	called Micros on the Move,
287	which is very well named,
288	because people kept stealing the computers.
290	(Laughter)
291	So I figured I needed to learn a little bit more about business,
295	so I went to Stanford Business School and studied there.
298	And while I was there, I made friends with a fellow
301	named Pierre Omidyar, who is here today. And Pierre, I apologize
304	for this. This is a photo from the old days.
307	And just after I'd graduated, Pierre came to me
309	with this idea to help people
311	buy and sell things online with each other.
313	And with the wisdom of my Stanford degree,
315	"I said, ""Pierre, what a stupid idea."""
317	(Laughter)
318	And needless to say, I was right.
319	(Laughter)
321	But right after that, Pierre -- in '96, Pierre and I left our full-time jobs
325	to build eBay as a company. And the rest of that story, you know.
330	The company went public two years later
332	and is today one of the best known companies in the world.
335	Hundreds of millions of people use it in hundreds of countries, and so on.
339	But for me, personally, it was a real change.
343	I went from living in a house with five guys in Palo Alto
347	and living off their leftovers,
348	to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources.
352	And I wanted to figure out how I could
354	take the blessing of these resources and share it with the world.
358	And around that time, I met John Gardner,
361	who is a remarkable man.
363	He was the architect of the Great Society programs
367	under Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s.
369	And I asked him what he felt was the best thing I could do,
372	or anyone could do, to make a difference
374	in the long-term issues facing humanity.
378	"And John said, ""Bet on good people doing good things."
382	"Bet on good people doing good things."""
384	And that really resonated with me.
386	I started a foundation
388	to bet on these good people doing good things.
390	These leading, innovative, nonprofit folks,
393	who are using business skills in a very leveraged way
396	to solve social problems.
398	People today we call social entrepreneurs.
401	And to put a face on it, people like Muhammad Yunus,
403	who started the Grameen Bank,
405	has lifted 100 million people plus out of poverty around the world,
409	won the Nobel Peace Prize.
410	But there's also a lot of people that you don't know.
413	Folks like Ann Cotton, who started a group called CAMFED in Africa,
417	because she felt girls' education was lagging.
420	And she started it about 10 years ago,
422	and today, she educates over a quarter million African girls.
427	And somebody like Dr. Victoria Hale,
430	who started the world's first nonprofit pharmaceutical company,
433	and whose first drug will be fighting visceral leishmaniasis,
439	also known as black fever.
441	And by 2010, she hopes to eliminate this disease,
444	which is really a scourge in the developing world.
447	And so this is one way to bet
449	on good people doing good things.
450	And a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of change
454	that I find really is powerful.
458	"It's what we call, ""Invest, connect and celebrate."""
460	And invest: if you see good people doing good things,
463	invest in them. Invest in their organizations,
465	or in business. Invest in these folks.
468	Connecting them together through conferences --
470	like a TED -- brings so many powerful connections,
473	or through the World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship
476	that my foundation does at Oxford every year.
479	And celebrate them: tell their stories,
482	because not only are there good people doing good work,
484	but their stories can help close these gaps of hope.
489	And it was this last part of the mission, the celebrate part,
492	that really got me back to thinking when I was a kid
496	and wanted to tell stories to get people involved
498	in the issues that affect us all.
500	And a light bulb went off,
502	which was, first, that I didn't actually have to do the writing myself, I could find writers.
507	And then the next light bulb was, better than just writing,
510	what about film and TV, to get out to people in a big way?
514	And I thought about the films that inspired me,
516	"films like ""Gandhi"" and ""Schindler's List."""
519	And I wondered who was doing these kinds of films today.
522	And there really wasn't a specific company
525	that was focused on the public interest.
528	So, in 2003, I started to make my way around Los Angeles
533	to talk about the idea of a pro-social media company
536	and I was met with a lot of encouragement.
539	One of the lines of encouragement
542	that I heard over and over was,
544	"""The streets of Hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you,"
548	"who think you're going to come to this town and make movies."""
551	And then of course, there was the other adage.
553	"""The surest way to become a millionaire"
555	"is to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business."""
558	(Laughter)
560	Undeterred, in January of 2004, I started Participant Productions
565	with the vision to be a global media company
568	focused on the public interest.
570	And our mission is to produce entertainment
572	that creates and inspires social change.
574	And we don't just want people to see our movies
577	and say, that was fun, and forget about it.
579	We want them to actually get involved in the issues.
582	In 2005, we launched our first slate of films,
585	"""Murder Ball,"" ""North Country,"" ""Syriana"""
588	"and ""Good Night and Good Luck."""
589	And much to my surprise, they were noticed.
592	We ended up with 11 Oscar nominations for these films.
596	And it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy.
599	Perhaps more importantly,
600	tens of thousands of people joined the advocacy programs
604	and the activism programs
606	that we created to go around the movies.
608	And we had an online component of that,
611	our community sect called Participate.net.
613	But with our social sector partners, like the ACLU and PBS and the
618	Sierra Club and the NRDC, once people saw the film,
621	there was actually something they could do to make a difference.
625	"One of these films in particular, called ""North Country,"" was actually"
631	kind of a box office disaster.
633	But it was a film that starred Charlize Theron
636	and it was about women's rights, women's empowerment,
639	domestic violence and so on.
641	And we released the film at the same time that
644	the Congress was debating the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act.
649	And with screenings on the Hill, and discussions,
652	and with our social sector partners,
654	like the National Organization of Women,
657	the film was widely credited
659	with influencing the successful renewal of the act.
663	And that to me, spoke volumes, because it's --
667	the film started about a true-life story
669	about a woman who was harassed, sued her employer,
673	led to a landmark case that led to the Equal Opportunity Act,
676	and the Violence Against Women Act and others.
678	And then the movie about this person doing these things,
681	then led to this greater renewal.
685	And so again,
686	it goes back to betting on good people doing good things.
690	Speaking of which, our fellow TEDster, Al --
693	I first saw Al do his slide show presentation
696	on global warming in May of 2005.
700	At that point, I thought I knew something about global warming.
703	I thought it was a 30 to 50 year problem.
705	And after we saw his slide show,
707	it became clear that it was much more urgent.
710	And so right afterwards, I met backstage with Al, and
714	with Lawrence Bender, who was there, and Laurie David,
716	and Davis Guggenheim,
718	who was running documentaries for Participant at the time.
722	And with Al's blessing, we decided on the spot to turn it into a film,
726	because we felt that we could get the message out there
729	far more quickly than having Al go around the world,
733	speaking to audiences of 100 or 200 at a time.
735	And you know, there's another adage in Hollywood,
738	that nobody knows nothing about anything.
740	And I really thought this was going to be
742	a straight-to-PBS charitable initiative.
746	And so it was a great shock to all of us
749	when the film really captured the public interest,
752	and today is mandatory viewing in schools in England and Scotland,
756	and most of Scandinavia.
758	We've sent 50,000 DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S.
764	and it's really changed the debate on global warming.
768	It was also a pretty good year for this guy.
770	We now call Al the George Clooney of global warming.
773	(Laughter)
775	And for Participant, this is just the start.
779	Everything we do looks at the major issues in the world.
781	And we have 10 films in production right now,
784	and dozens others in development.
787	I'll quickly talk about a few coming up.
789	"One is ""Charlie Wilson's War,"" with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts."
793	And it's the true story of Congressman Charlie Wilson, and
796	how he funded the Taliban to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.
801	"And we're also doing a movie called ""The Kite Runner,"""
803	"based on the book ""The Kite Runner,"" also about Afghanistan."
807	And we think once people see these films,
808	they'll have a much better understanding of that part of the world
811	and the Middle East in general.
813	"We premiered a film called ""The Chicago 10"" at Sundance this year."
817	It's based on the protesters at the Democratic Convention in 1968,
821	Abby Hoffman and crew,
823	and, again, a story about a small group of individuals
827	who did make change in the world.
829	And a documentary that we're doing on Jimmy Carter
833	and his Mid-East peace efforts over the years.
835	And in particular, we've been following him on his recent book tour,
840	which, as many of you know, has been very non-controversial --
843	(Laughter)
844	-- which is really bad for getting people to come see a movie.
847	In closing, I'd like to say that everybody has the opportunity
851	to make change in their own way.
853	And all the people in this room
856	have done so through their business lives,
858	or their philanthropic work, or their other interests.
862	And one thing that I've learned
864	is that there's never one right way to make change.
866	One can do it as a tech person, or as a finance person,
869	or a nonprofit person, or as an entertainment person,
873	but every one of us is all of those things and more.
877	And I believe if we do these things,
880	we can close the opportunity gaps, we can close the hope gaps.
884	And I can imagine, if we do this,
886	the headlines in 10 years might read something like these:
891	"""New AIDS Cases in Africa Fall to Zero,"""
894	"""U.S. Imports its Last Barrel of Oil"" --"
897	(Applause)
899	"-- ""Israelis and Palestinians Celebrate"
905	(Applause)
908	"And I like this one, ""Snow Has Returned to Kilimanjaro."""
910	(Laughter)
913	And finally, an eBay listing for one well-traveled slide show,
919	now obsolete, museum piece. Please contact Al Gore.
925	And I believe that, working together,
928	we can make all of these things happen.
930	And I want to thank you all for having me here today.
932	It's been a real honor. Thank you.
933	(Applause)
936	Oh, thank you.
