15.684	In Oxford in the 1950s,
17.546	there was a fantastic doctor, who was very unusual,
21.314	named Alice Stewart.
23.346	And Alice was unusual partly because, of course,
26.489	she was a woman, which was pretty rare in the 1950s.
29.969	And she was brilliant, she was one of the,
32.08	at the time, the youngest Fellow to be elected to the Royal College of Physicians.
36.896	She was unusual too because she continued to work after she got married,
40.653	after she had kids,
42.748	and even after she got divorced and was a single parent,
45.756	she continued her medical work.
48.039	And she was unusual because she was really interested in a new science,
52.159	the emerging field of epidemiology,
54.783	the study of patterns in disease.
58.271	But like every scientist, she appreciated
60.439	that to make her mark, what she needed to do
62.695	was find a hard problem and solve it.
67.213	The hard problem that Alice chose
69.757	was the rising incidence of childhood cancers.
73.155	Most disease is correlated with poverty,
75.345	but in the case of childhood cancers,
77.614	the children who were dying seemed mostly to come
80.218	from affluent families.
82.663	So, what, she wanted to know,
84.406	could explain this anomaly?
87.488	Now, Alice had trouble getting funding for her research.
90.271	In the end, she got just 1,000 pounds
92.262	from the Lady Tata Memorial prize.
94.517	And that meant she knew she only had one shot
97.06	at collecting her data.
99.102	Now, she had no idea what to look for.
101.579	This really was a needle in a haystack sort of search,
104.695	so she asked everything she could think of.
107.317	Had the children eaten boiled sweets?
109.15	Had they consumed colored drinks?
111.223	Did they eat fish and chips?
112.87	Did they have indoor or outdoor plumbing?
114.878	What time of life had they started school?
118.294	And when her carbon copied questionnaire started to come back,
121.662	one thing and one thing only jumped out
124.582	with the statistical clarity of a kind that
127.118	most scientists can only dream of.
129.958	By a rate of two to one,
131.878	the children who had died
133.959	had had mothers who had been X-rayed when pregnant.
140.254	Now that finding flew in the face of conventional wisdom.
144.759	Conventional wisdom held
146.666	that everything was safe up to a point, a threshold.
150.663	It flew in the face of conventional wisdom,
152.99	which was huge enthusiasm for the cool new technology
156.448	of that age, which was the X-ray machine.
160.094	And it flew in the face of doctors' idea of themselves,
164.318	which was as people who helped patients,
168.126	they didn't harm them.
170.822	Nevertheless, Alice Stewart rushed to publish
174.51	her preliminary findings in The Lancet in 1956.
178.094	People got very excited, there was talk of the Nobel Prize,
182.102	and Alice really was in a big hurry
184.222	to try to study all the cases of childhood cancer she could find
188.013	before they disappeared.
190.166	In fact, she need not have hurried.
194.51	It was fully 25 years before the British and medical --
198.701	British and American medical establishments
201.573	abandoned the practice of X-raying pregnant women.
207.677	The data was out there, it was open, it was freely available,
213.158	but nobody wanted to know.
217.382	A child a week was dying,
220.066	but nothing changed.
222.799	Openness alone can't drive change.
229.054	So for 25 years Alice Stewart had a very big fight on her hands.
234.671	So, how did she know that she was right?
237.918	Well, she had a fantastic model for thinking.
241.581	She worked with a statistician named George Kneale,
243.826	and George was pretty much everything that Alice wasn't.
246.21	So, Alice was very outgoing and sociable,
249.279	and George was a recluse.
251.737	Alice was very warm, very empathetic with her patients.
255.751	George frankly preferred numbers to people.
259.79	But he said this fantastic thing about their working relationship.
263.768	"He said, ""My job is to prove Dr. Stewart wrong."""
270.104	He actively sought disconfirmation.
273.661	Different ways of looking at her models,
275.998	at her statistics, different ways of crunching the data
279.255	in order to disprove her.
282.318	He saw his job as creating conflict around her theories.
287.942	Because it was only by not being able to prove
291.038	that she was wrong,
293.406	that George could give Alice the confidence she needed
296.527	to know that she was right.
299.509	It's a fantastic model of collaboration --
304.184	thinking partners who aren't echo chambers.
309.191	I wonder how many of us have,
311.543	or dare to have, such collaborators.
318.462	Alice and George were very good at conflict.
322.239	They saw it as thinking.
325.375	So what does that kind of constructive conflict require?
329.648	Well, first of all, it requires that we find people
333.023	who are very different from ourselves.
335.671	That means we have to resist the neurobiological drive,
340.007	which means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves,
344.511	and it means we have to seek out people
346.735	with different backgrounds, different disciplines,
349.207	different ways of thinking and different experience,
353.358	and find ways to engage with them.
357.223	That requires a lot of patience and a lot of energy.
361.867	And the more I've thought about this,
363.678	the more I think, really, that that's a kind of love.
368.839	Because you simply won't commit that kind of energy
371.908	and time if you don't really care.
376.599	And it also means that we have to be prepared to change our minds.
381.059	Alice's daughter told me
383.423	that every time Alice went head-to-head with a fellow scientist,
386.535	they made her think and think and think again.
390.719	"""My mother,"" she said, ""My mother didn't enjoy a fight,"
394.737	"but she was really good at them."""
399.879	So it's one thing to do that in a one-to-one relationship.
404.049	But it strikes me that the biggest problems we face,
407.336	many of the biggest disasters that we've experienced,
410.21	mostly haven't come from individuals,
412.161	they've come from organizations,
414.049	some of them bigger than countries,
416.057	many of them capable of affecting hundreds,
418.317	thousands, even millions of lives.
422.32	So how do organizations think?
426.758	Well, for the most part, they don't.
430.784	And that isn't because they don't want to,
433.777	it's really because they can't.
436.182	And they can't because the people inside of them
439.529	are too afraid of conflict.
443.737	In surveys of European and American executives,
446.601	fully 85 percent of them acknowledged
449.571	that they had issues or concerns at work
453.088	that they were afraid to raise.
456.721	Afraid of the conflict that that would provoke,
459.88	afraid to get embroiled in arguments
462.248	that they did not know how to manage,
464.279	and felt that they were bound to lose.
468.856	Eighty-five percent is a really big number.
475.033	It means that organizations mostly can't do
477.848	what George and Alice so triumphantly did.
480.176	They can't think together.
484.575	And it means that people like many of us,
486.816	who have run organizations,
489	and gone out of our way to try to find the very best people we can,
492.567	mostly fail to get the best out of them.
498.84	So how do we develop the skills that we need?
502.176	Because it does take skill and practice, too.
506.259	If we aren't going to be afraid of conflict,
509.673	we have to see it as thinking,
511.832	and then we have to get really good at it.
516.168	So, recently, I worked with an executive named Joe,
520.432	and Joe worked for a medical device company.
523.904	And Joe was very worried about the device that he was working on.
526.879	He thought that it was too complicated
529.904	and he thought that its complexity
531.768	created margins of error that could really hurt people.
536.035	He was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help.
540.175	But when he looked around his organization,
542.48	nobody else seemed to be at all worried.
546.941	So, he didn't really want to say anything.
549.496	After all, maybe they knew something he didn't.
551.68	Maybe he'd look stupid.
554.264	But he kept worrying about it,
556.47	and he worried about it so much that he got to the point
559.516	where he thought the only thing he could do
561.675	was leave a job he loved.
565.805	In the end, Joe and I found a way
569.805	for him to raise his concerns.
571.66	And what happened then is what almost always
574.531	happens in this situation.
576.125	It turned out everybody had exactly the same
579.346	questions and doubts.
581.092	So now Joe had allies. They could think together.
585.124	And yes, there was a lot of conflict and debate
588.388	and argument, but that allowed everyone around the table
592.692	to be creative, to solve the problem,
596.772	and to change the device.
601.1	Joe was what a lot of people might think of
604.476	as a whistle-blower,
606.748	except that like almost all whistle-blowers,
609.463	he wasn't a crank at all,
611.836	he was passionately devoted to the organization
615.284	and the higher purposes that that organization served.
618.732	But he had been so afraid of conflict,
622.548	until finally he became more afraid of the silence.
627.628	And when he dared to speak,
629.487	he discovered much more inside himself
632.885	and much more give in the system than he had ever imagined.
638.127	And his colleagues don't think of him as a crank.
641.458	They think of him as a leader.
646.586	So, how do we have these conversations more easily
650.954	and more often?
652.867	Well, the University of Delft
654.853	requires that its PhD students
657.25	have to submit five statements that they're prepared to defend.
661.163	It doesn't really matter what the statements are about,
664.547	what matters is that the candidates are willing and able
668.339	to stand up to authority.
670.942	I think it's a fantastic system,
673.306	but I think leaving it to PhD candidates
675.819	is far too few people, and way too late in life.
680.124	I think we need to be teaching these skills
683.29	to kids and adults at every stage of their development,
687.37	if we want to have thinking organizations
689.819	and a thinking society.
693.466	The fact is that most of the biggest catastrophes that we've witnessed
699.084	rarely come from information that is secret or hidden.
705.475	It comes from information that is freely available and out there,
709.779	but that we are willfully blind to,
712.163	because we can't handle, don't want to handle,
715.291	the conflict that it provokes.
719.698	But when we dare to break that silence,
722.627	or when we dare to see,
725.284	and we create conflict,
727.539	we enable ourselves and the people around us
730.164	to do our very best thinking.
734.41	Open information is fantastic,
737.786	open networks are essential.
740.97	But the truth won't set us free
742.947	until we develop the skills and the habit and the talent
746.711	and the moral courage to use it.
750.848	Openness isn't the end.
754.608	It's the beginning.
757.25	(Applause)
