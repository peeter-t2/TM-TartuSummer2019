16.22	There are a lot of ways
16.22	the people around us
19.568	can help improve our lives.
21.695	We don't bump into every neighbor,
23.339	so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on,
26.41	though we do share the same public spaces.
29.362	So over the past few years,
29.362	I've tried ways to share more
32.147	with my neighbors in public space,
34.487	using simple tools like
34.487	stickers, stencils and chalk.
38.058	And these projects came
38.058	from questions I had, like:
41.454	How much are my neighbors
41.454	paying for their apartments?
44.169	(Laughter)
45.383	How can we lend and borrow more things,
47.661	without knocking on each
47.661	other's doors at a bad time?
51.978	How can we share more memories
51.978	of our abandoned buildings,
56.055	and gain a better understanding
56.055	of our landscape?
59.811	How can we share more of our hopes
59.811	for our vacant storefronts,
64.153	so our communities can reflect
64.153	our needs and dreams today?
70.034	Now, I live in New Orleans,
71.989	and I am in love with New Orleans.
74.66	My soul is always soothed
74.66	by the giant live oak trees,
79.192	shading lovers, drunks and dreamers
79.192	for hundreds of years,
83.588	and I trust a city that always
83.588	makes way for music.
86.874	I feel like every time someone sneezes,
89.316	New Orleans has a parade.
90.579	(Laughter)
91.888	The city has some of the most
91.888	beautiful architecture in the world,
95.428	but it also has one of the highest amounts
95.428	of abandoned properties in America.
100.062	I live near this house,
101.514	and I thought about how I could
101.514	make it a nicer space for my neighborhood,
105.379	and I also thought about something
105.379	that changed my life forever.
111.566	In 2009, I lost someone I loved very much.
115.93	Her name was Joan,
115.93	and she was a mother to me.
119.834	And her death was sudden and unexpected.
126.424	And I thought about death a lot.
132.821	And ... this made me feel deep
132.821	gratitude for the time I've had.
139.502	And ... brought clarity to the things
139.502	that are meaningful to my life now.
149.923	But I struggle to maintain
149.923	this perspective in my daily life.
154.724	I feel like it's easy to get
154.724	caught up in the day-to-day,
157.557	and forget what really matters to you.
160.24	So with help from old and new friends,
162.394	I turned the side of this abandoned
162.394	house into a giant chalkboard,
166.272	and stenciled it with
166.272	a fill-in-the-blank sentence:
169.203	"""Before I die, I want to ..."""
173.723	So anyone walking by
173.723	can pick up a piece of chalk,
176.826	reflect on their life,
178.248	and share their personal
178.248	aspirations in public space.
182.746	I didn't know what to expect
182.746	from this experiment,
185.864	but by the next day,
185.864	the wall was entirely filled out,
189.209	and it kept growing.
191.201	And I'd like to share a few things
191.201	that people wrote on this wall.
197.204	"""Before I die, I want"
197.204	"to be tried for piracy."""
200.661	(Laughter)
207.461	"""Before I die, I want to straddle"
207.461	"the International Dateline."""
213.468	"""Before I die, I want"
213.468	"to sing for millions."""
218.239	"""Before I die, I want to plant a tree."""
223.987	"""Before I die, I want"
223.987	"to live off the grid."""
228.61	"""Before I die, I want"
228.61	"to hold her one more time."""
235.039	"""Before I die, I want"
235.039	"to be someone's cavalry."""
240.825	"""Before I die, I want"
240.825	"to be completely myself."""
249.231	So this neglected space
249.231	became a constructive one,
253.23	and people's hopes and dreams
253.23	made me laugh out loud, tear up,
258.126	and they consoled me
258.126	during my own tough times.
261.366	It's about knowing you're not alone;
263.804	it's about understanding our neighbors
263.804	in new and enlightening ways;
267.51	it's about making space
267.51	for reflection and contemplation,
270.883	and remembering what really matters
270.883	most to us as we grow and change.
277.419	I made this last year,
278.68	and started receiving hundreds
278.68	of messages from passionate people
282.099	who wanted to make a wall
282.099	with their community.
284.54	So, my civic center colleagues
284.54	and I made a tool kit,
287.74	and now walls have been made
287.74	in countries around the world,
290.582	including Kazakhstan,
294.019	South Africa,
296.754	Australia,
299.23	Argentina, and beyond.
301.689	Together, we've shown how powerful
301.689	our public spaces can be
304.595	if we're given the opportunity
304.595	to have a voice,
307.32	and share more with one another.
312.927	Two of the most valuable things we have
315.063	are time, and our relationships
315.063	with other people.
319.522	In our age of increasing distractions,
322.07	it's more important than ever
322.07	to find ways to maintain perspective,
325.57	and remember that life
325.57	is brief and tender.
329.528	Death is something that we're
329.528	often discouraged to talk about,
332.592	or even think about,
333.886	but I've realized that preparing for death
336.234	is one of the most empowering
336.234	things you can do.
339.464	Thinking about death clarifies your life.
344.971	Our shared spaces can better
344.971	reflect what matters to us,
347.884	as individuals and as a community,
351.197	and with more ways to share
351.197	our hopes, fears and stories,
355.157	the people around us can not only
355.157	help us make better places,
359.101	they can help us lead better lives.
361.545	Thank you.
362.721	(Applause)
367.318	Thank you.
368.498	(Applause)
