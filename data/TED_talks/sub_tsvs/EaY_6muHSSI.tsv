15.26	Planetary systems outside our own
17.26	are like distant cities whose lights we can see twinkling,
20.26	but whose streets we can't walk.
23.26	By studying those twinkling lights though,
25.26	we can learn about how stars and planets interact
28.26	to form their own ecosystem
30.26	and make habitats that are amenable to life.
33.26	In this image of the Tokyo skyline,
35.26	I've hidden data
37.26	from the newest planet-hunting space telescope on the block,
39.26	the Kepler Mission.
41.26	Can you see it?
43.26	There we go.
45.26	This is just a tiny part of the sky the Kepler stares at,
48.26	where it searches for planets
50.26	by measuring the light from over 150,000 stars,
53.26	all at once, every half hour,
55.26	and very precisely.
57.26	And what we're looking for
59.26	is the tiny dimming of light
61.26	that is caused by a planet passing in front of one of these stars
64.26	and blocking some of that starlight from getting to us.
67.26	In just over two years of operations,
70.26	we've found over 1,200
72.26	potential new planetary systems around other stars.
75.26	To give you some perspective,
77.26	in the previous two decades of searching,
80.26	we had only known about 400
82.26	prior to Kepler.
84.26	When we see these little dips in the light,
86.26	we can determine a number of things.
88.26	For one thing, we can determine that there's a planet there,
90.26	but also how big that planet is
93.26	and how far it is away from its parent star.
96.26	That distance is really important
98.26	because it tells us
100.26	how much light the planet receives overall.
102.26	And that distance and knowing that amount of light is important
105.26	because it's a little like you or I sitting around a campfire:
108.26	You want to be close enough to the campfire so that you're warm,
110.26	but not so close
112.26	that you're too toasty and you get burned.
114.26	However, there's more to know about your parent star
117.26	than just how much light you receive overall.
119.26	And I'll tell you why.
121.26	This is our star. This is our Sun.
124.26	It's shown here in visible light.
126.26	That's the light that you can see with your own human eyes.
128.26	You'll notice that it looks pretty much
130.26	like the iconic yellow ball --
132.26	that Sun that we all draw when we're children.
134.26	But you'll notice something else,
136.26	and that's that the face of the Sun
138.26	has freckles.
140.26	These freckles are called sunspots,
142.26	and they are just one of the manifestations
144.26	of the Sun's magnetic field.
146.26	They also cause the light from the star to vary.
149.26	And we can measure this
151.26	very, very precisely with Kepler and trace their effects.
154.26	However, these are just the tip of the iceberg.
157.26	If we had UV eyes or X-ray eyes,
160.26	we would really see
162.26	the dynamic and dramatic effects
164.26	of our Sun's magnetic activity --
166.26	the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well.
169.26	Just think, even when it's cloudy outside,
171.26	these kind of events are happening
173.26	in the sky above you all the time.
177.26	So when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable,
180.26	whether it might be amenable to life,
182.26	we want to know not only how much total light it receives
184.26	and how warm it is,
186.26	but we want to know about its space weather --
189.26	this high-energy radiation,
191.26	the UV and the X-rays
193.26	that are created by its star
195.26	and that bathe it in this bath of high-energy radiation.
198.26	And so, we can't really look
200.26	at planets around other stars
202.26	in the same kind of detail
204.26	that we can look at planets in our own solar system.
207.26	I'm showing here Venus, Earth and Mars --
209.26	three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size,
212.26	but only one of which
214.26	is really a good place to live.
216.26	But what we can do in the meantime
218.26	is measure the light from our stars
221.26	and learn about this relationship
223.26	between the planets and their parent stars
225.26	to suss out clues
227.26	about which planets might be good places
229.26	to look for life in the universe.
231.26	Kepler won't find a planet
233.26	around every single star it looks at.
235.26	But really, every measurement it makes
237.26	is precious,
239.26	because it's teaching us about the relationship
241.26	between stars and planets,
243.26	and how it's really the starlight
245.26	that sets the stage
247.26	for the formation of life in the universe.
249.26	While it's Kepler the telescope, the instrument that stares,
252.26	it's we, life, who are searching.
255.26	Thank you.
257.26	(Applause)
