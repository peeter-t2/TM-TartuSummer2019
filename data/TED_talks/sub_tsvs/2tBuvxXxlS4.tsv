13.619	Ten years ago,
15.089	I got a phone call that
15.089	changed my life.
18.897	At the time, I was 
18.897	cardiologist at UCLA,
22.849	specializing in cardiac 
22.849	imaging techniques.
26.286	The call came from a veterinarian
26.286	at the Los Angeles Zoo.
31.815	An elderly female chimpanzee
34.469	had woken up with a facial droop
37.292	and the veterinarians were worried
37.292	that she'd had a stroke.
40.628	They asked if I'd 
40.628	come to the zoo
43.653	and image the animal's heart
45.601	to look for a possible
45.601	cardiac cause.
49.291	Now, to be clear, North American
49.291	zoos are staffed
52.929	by highly qualified, 
52.929	board-certified veterinarians
57.058	who take outstanding 
57.058	care of their animal patients.
61.727	But occasionally, they do reach into 
61.727	the human medical community,
65.813	particularly for some 
65.813	speciality consultation,
70.414	and I was one of the lucky physicians
70.414	who was invited in to help.
76.233	I had a chance to rule out
76.233	a stroke in this chimpanzee
82.736	and make sure that this gorilla 
82.736	didn't have a torn aorta,
88.8	evaluate this macaw
88.8	for a heart murmur,
93.587	make sure that this California sea lion's
93.587	paricardium wasn't inflamed,
101.056	and in this picture, I'm listening
101.056	to the heart of a lion
105.314	after a lifesaving, 
105.314	collaborative procedure
108.931	with veterinarians and physicians
111.848	where we drained 700 cc's of 
111.848	fluid from the sac
116.165	in which this lion's 
116.165	heart was contained.
120.569	And this procedure, which I have
120.569	done on many human patients,
125.382	was identical, with the exception
125.382	of that paw and that tail.
134.733	Now most of the time, I was working
134.733	at UCLA Medical Center with physicians,
141.124	discussing symptoms
141.124	and diagnoses and treatments
146.158	for my human patients,
149.599	but some of the time,
149.599	I was working at the Los Angeles Zoo
152.677	with veterinarians, discussing 
152.677	symptoms and diagnoses and treatments
158.122	for their animal patients.
160.748	And occasionally, on 
160.748	the very same day,
165.841	I went on rounds at 
165.841	UCLA Medical Center
169.62	and at the Los Angeles Zoo.
172.523	And here's what started coming
172.523	into very clear focus for me.
178.861	Physicians and veterinarians
178.861	were essentially taking care
183.167	of the same disorders in their 
183.167	animal and human patients:
188.337	congestive heart failure, brain tumors,
192.85	leukemia, diabetes, 
192.85	arthritis, ALS, breast cancer,
201.101	even psychiatric syndromes
201.101	like depression, anxiety,
206.241	compulsions, eating disorders
206.241	and self-injury.
212.788	Now, I've got a confession to make.
215.666	Even though I studied comparative
215.666	physiology and evolutionary biology
222.515	as an undergrad --
224.598	I had even written my senior 
224.598	thesis on Darwinian theory --
229.136	learning about the 
229.136	significant overlap
231.856	between the disorders of 
231.856	animals and humans,
234.592	it came as a much needed 
234.592	wake-up call for me.
240.311	So I started wondering,
240.311	with all of these overlaps,
244.799	how was it that I had never
244.799	thought to ask a veterinarian,
250.317	or consult the veterinary literature,
252.844	for insights into one 
252.844	of my human patients?
257.173	Why had I never, nor had any of my 
257.173	physician friends and colleagues
263.324	whom I asked, ever attended 
263.324	a veterinary conference?
270.327	For that matter, why was 
270.327	any of this a surprise?
276.443	I mean, look, every single physician
276.443	accepts some biological connection
282.588	between animals and humans.
285.488	Every medication that we prescribe
285.488	or that we've taken ourselves
290.257	or we've given to our families
292.891	has first been tested on an animal.
296.471	But there's something very different
298.227	about giving an animal a 
298.227	medication or a human disease
304.832	and the animal developing 
304.832	congestive heart failure
308.777	or diabetes or breast cancer 
308.777	on their own.
315.324	Now, maybe some of the surprise
317.955	comes from the increasing
317.955	separation in our world
321.539	between the urban and the nonurban.
325.423	You know, we hear about these city kids
328.121	who think that wool grows on trees
332.192	or that cheese comes from a plant.
336.256	Well, today's human hospitals,
338.989	increasingly, are turning into these
338.989	gleaming cathedrals of technology.
345.81	And this creates a psychological
345.81	distance between the human patients
350.717	who are being treated there
353.437	and animal patients who
353.437	are living in oceans
357.934	and farms and jungles.
361.452	But I think there's an 
361.452	even deeper reason.
366.561	Physicians and scientists, we accept
366.561	intellectually that our species,
373.294	Homo sapiens, is merely 
373.294	one species,
377.035	no more unique or
377.035	special than any other.
382.506	But in our hearts, we don't 
382.506	completely believe that.
388.572	I feel it myself when I'm 
388.572	listening to Mozart
392.866	or looking at pictures of the 
392.866	Mars Rover on my MacBook.
398.266	I feel that tug of 
398.266	human exceptionalism,
403.812	even as I recognize the 
403.812	scientifically isolating cost
408.37	of seeing ourselves as a
408.37	superior species, apart.
414.746	Well, I'm trying these days.
417.979	When I see a human patient
417.979	now, I always ask,
422.441	what do the animal doctors know
422.441	about this problem that I don't know?
427.283	And, might I be taking better 
427.283	care of my human patient
432.745	if I saw them as a human
432.745	animal patient?
439.858	Here are a few examples of the 
439.858	kind of exciting connections
444.095	that this kind of 
444.095	thinking has led me to.
448.057	Fear-induced heart failure.
450.894	Around the year 2000,
453.398	"human cardiologists ""discovered"""
453.398	emotionally induced heart failure.
460.898	It was described in a gambling father 
460.898	who had lost his life's savings
466	with a roll of the dice,
469.152	in a bride who'd
469.152	been left at the alter.
473.823	But it turns out, this 
473.823	"""new"" human diagnosis"
478.464	was neither new, nor
478.464	was it uniquely human.
482.939	Veterinarians had been diagnosing, 
482.939	treating and even preventing
488.867	emotionally induced
488.867	symptoms in animals
492.746	ranging from monkeys to flamingos,
492.746	from to deer to rabbits,
498.65	since the 1970s.
502.968	How many human lives 
502.968	might have been saved
506.334	if this veterinary knowledge
506.334	had been put into the hands
509.939	of E.R. docs and cardiologists?
515.055	Self-injury.
517.517	Some human patients 
517.517	harm themselves.
521.652	Some pluck out patches of hair,
525.352	others actually cut themselves.
530.242	Some animal patients 
530.242	also harm themselves.
534.064	There are birds that 
534.064	pluck out feathers.
537.544	There are stallions that repetitively
537.544	bite their flanks until they bleed.
545.313	But veterinarians have very specific
545.313	and very effective ways
550.485	of treating and even
550.485	preventing self-injury
554.904	in their self-injuring animals.
558.686	Shouldn't this veterinary knowledge
558.686	be put into the hands
561.733	of psychotherapists and 
561.733	parents and patients
565.459	struggling with self-injury?
569.497	Postpartum depression and 
569.497	postpartum psychosis.
574.332	Sometimes, soon after giving birth,
577.467	some women become depressed,
579.891	and sometimes they become seriously 
579.891	depressed and even psychotic.
584.197	They may neglect their newborn,
586.761	and in some extreme cases,
588.937	even harm the child.
592.086	Equine veterinarians also
592.086	know that occasionally,
596.312	a mare, soon after giving birth,
599.433	will neglect the foal,
599.433	refusing to nurse,
602.646	and in some instances,
602.646	kick the foal, even to death.
609.018	But veterinarians have devised
611.823	an intervention to deal with
611.823	this foal rejection syndrome
617.296	that involves increasing 
617.296	oxytocin in the mare.
621.561	Oxytocin is the bonding hormone,
624.946	and this leads to renewed interest,
627.635	on the part of the mare, in her foal.
631.065	Shouldn't this information
633.121	be put into the hands of ob/gyn's
636.461	and family doctors and patients
639.794	who are struggling with postpartum
639.794	depression and psychosis?
647.306	Well, despite all of this promise,
649.653	unfortunately the gulf between
649.653	our fields remains large.
657.461	To explain it, I'm afraid I'm going 
657.461	to have to air some dirty laundry.
662.99	Some physicians can be real snobs
667.095	about doctors who are not M.D.'s.
669.649	I'm talking about dentists and 
669.649	optometrists and psychologists,
675.975	but maybe especially animal doctors.
680.202	Of course, most physicians
680.202	don't realize that it is harder
684.075	to get into vet school these
684.075	days than medical school,
688.458	and that when we go 
688.458	to medical school,
690.742	we learn everything 
690.742	there is to know
693.355	about one species, Homo sapiens,
696.478	but veterinarians need to learn
696.478	about health and disease
700.785	in mammals, amphibians,
700.785	reptiles, fish and birds.
705.763	So I don't blame the vets
705.763	for feeling annoyed
710.447	by my profession's
710.447	condescension and ignorance.
716.412	But here's one from the vets:
719.152	What do you call a veterinarian
722.559	who can only take 
722.559	care of one species?
728.416	A physician. (Laughter)
731.737	Closing the gap has become 
731.737	a passion for me,
737.946	and I'm doing this 
737.946	through programs
740.547	like Darwin on Rounds at UCLA,
743.689	where we're bringing animal experts 
743.689	and evolutionary biologists
749.236	and embedding them
749.236	on our medical teams
753.388	with our interns and our residents.
757.326	And through Zoobiquity conferences,
761.033	where we bring medical schools 
761.033	together with veterinary schools
765.252	for collabortive discussions
767.392	of the shared diseases and disorders
770.193	of animal and human patients.
774.319	At Zoobiquity conferences,
777.162	participants learn how treating
777.162	breast cancer in a tiger
782.582	can help us better treat breast cancer
785.535	in a kindergarten teacher;
788.846	how understanding polycystic
788.846	overies in a Holstein cow
793.709	can help us better take care
795.943	of a dance instructor 
795.943	with painful periods;
800.503	and how better understanding the 
800.503	treatment of separation anxiety
805.152	in a high-strung Sheltie
807.561	can help an anxious young child
807.561	struggling with his first days of school.
814.962	In the United States and now 
814.962	internationally, at Zoobiquity conferences
820.207	physicians and veterinarians check 
820.207	their attitudes and their preconceptions
827.076	at the door and come 
827.076	together as colleagues,
833.1	as peers, as doctors.
838.965	After all, we humans 
838.965	are animals, too,
844.385	and it's time for us physicians to embrace
847.845	our patients' and our own animal natures
852.392	and join veterinarians
854.53	in a species-spanning approach to health.
859.518	Because it turns out,
861.731	some of the best and 
861.731	most humanistic medicine
866.929	is being practiced by doctors
866.929	whose patients aren't human.
872.469	And one of the best ways 
872.469	we can take care
875.851	of the human patient is by 
875.851	paying close attention
880.952	to how all the other 
880.952	patients on the planet
884.655	live, grow, get sick and heal.
891.312	Thank you.
893.897	(Applause).
