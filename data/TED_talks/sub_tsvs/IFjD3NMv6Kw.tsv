12.494	So, let me add to the complexity
14.5	of the situation we find ourselves in.
17.09	At the same time that we're solving
17.09	for climate change,
21.44	we're going to be building cities
21.44	for three billion people.
26.397	That's a doubling
26.397	of the urban environment.
29.727	If we don't get that right,
31.424	I'm not sure all the climate solutions
31.424	in the world will save mankind,
36.627	because so much depends
36.627	on how we shape our cities:
40.426	not just environmental impacts,
42.68	but our social well-being,
44.34	our economic vitality,
46.646	our sense of community and connectedness.
49.974	Fundamentally, the way we shape cities
49.974	is a manifestation
53.169	of the kind of humanity we bring to bear.
55.852	And so getting it right is, I think,
58.986	the order of the day.
60.656	And to a certain degree, getting it right
60.656	can help us solve climate change,
64.308	because in the end,
65.484	it's our behavior that seems
65.484	to be driving the problem.
68.936	The problem isn't free-floating,
70.838	and it isn't just ExxonMobil
70.838	and oil companies.
74.768	It's us; how we live.
78.161	How we live.
79.864	There's a villain in this story.
81.453	It's called sprawl,
81.453	and I'll be upfront about that.
84.99	But it's not just the kind of sprawl
84.99	you think of, or many people think of,
88.799	as low-density development
90.453	out at the periphery
90.453	of the metropolitan area.
93.952	Actually, I think sprawl can happen
93.952	anywhere, at any density.
99.16	The key attribute
99.16	is that it isolates people.
102.874	It segregates people
102.874	into economic enclaves
106.788	and land-use enclaves.
108.404	It separates them from nature.
110.524	It doesn't allow the cross-fertilization,
113.702	the interaction,
114.99	that make cities great places
117.437	and that make society thrive.
120.209	So the antidote to sprawl is really
120.209	what we all need to be thinking about,
124.975	especially when we're taking on
124.975	this massive construction project.
129.925	So let me take you through one exercise.
132.434	We developed the model
132.434	for the state of California
136.224	so they could get on
136.224	with reducing carbon emissions.
139.866	We did a whole series of scenarios
139.866	for how the state could grow,
145.386	and this is just one
145.386	overly simplified one.
148.533	We mixed different development prototypes
151.353	and said they're going to carry us
151.353	through the year 2050,
	in our state of California.
160.511	And one was sprawl.
161.787	It's just more of the same:
161.787	shopping malls, subdivisions,
165.343	office parks.
166.551	The other one was dominated by,
166.551	not everybody moving to the city,
170.365	but just compact development,
172.072	what we used to think of
172.072	as streetcar suburbs,
174.654	walkable neighborhoods,
175.917	low-rise, but integrated,
175.917	mixed-used environments.
180.789	And the results are astounding.
183.249	They're astounding not just
183.249	for the scale of the difference
186.436	of this one shift
186.436	in our city-making habit
190.695	but also because each one represents
190.695	a special interest group,
196.053	a special interest group
196.053	that used to advocate for their concerns
200.466	one at a time.
201.655	They did not see the, what I call,
201.655	"""co-benefits"" of urban form"
206.778	that allows them to join with others.
209.277	So, land consumption:
210.889	environmentalists are really
210.889	concerned about this,
213.727	so are farmers;
215.516	there's a whole range of people,
217.762	and, of course, neighborhood groups
217.762	that want open space nearby.
221.681	The sprawl version of California
223.791	almost doubles the urban
223.791	physical footprint.
228.249	Greenhouse gas: tremendous savings,
230.948	because in California, our biggest
230.948	carbon emission comes from cars,
235.787	and cities that don't depend
235.787	on cars as much
239.511	obviously create huge savings.
243.421	Vehicle miles traveled:
243.421	that's what I was just talking about.
246.521	Just reducing the average 10,000 miles
246.521	per household per year,
251.53	from somewhere
251.53	in the mid-26,000 per household,
256.884	has a huge impact
256.884	not just on air quality and carbon
261.788	but also on the household pocketbook.
264.383	It's very expensive to drive that much,
267.4	and as we've seen,
268.816	the middle class is struggling to hold on.
272.133	Health care: we were talking about
272.133	how do you fix it once we broke it --
276.142	clean the air.
277.325	Why not just stop polluting?
279.34	Why not just use our feet and bikes more?
282.792	And that's a function of the kinds
282.792	of cities that we shape.
287.134	Household costs:
291.385	not of just the financial
291.385	industry running amok.
295.463	It was that we were trying to sell
295.463	too many of the wrong kind of housing:
300.146	large lot, single family, distant,
303.121	too expensive for the average
303.121	middle-class family to afford
307.346	and, quite frankly, not a good fit
307.346	to their lifestyle anymore.
310.972	But in order to move inventory,
313.286	you can discount the financing
313.286	and get it sold.
316.516	I think that's a lot of what happened.
318.388	Reducing cost by 10,000 dollars --
321.078	remember, in California
321.078	the median is 50,000 --
323.939	this is a big element.
325.844	That's just cars and utility costs.
328.497	So the affordable housing advocates,
328.497	who often sit off in their silos
332.721	separate from the environmentalists,
332.721	separate from the politicians,
337.209	everybody fighting with everyone,
339.211	now begin to see common cause,
341.153	and I think the common cause
341.153	is what really brings about the change.
345.657	Los Angeles, as a result of these efforts,
348.561	has now decided to transform itself
351.609	into a more transit-oriented environment.
355.005	As a matter of fact, since '08,
356.763	they've voted in 400 billion dollars
356.763	of bonds for transit
360.736	and zero dollars for new highways.
363.609	What a transformation:
364.801	LA becomes a city of walkers and transit,
368.156	not a city of cars.
369.359	(Applause)
370.39	How does it happen?
371.614	You take the least
371.614	desirable land, the strip,
373.775	you add where there's space, transit
375.846	and then you infill mixed-use development,
380.133	you satisfy new housing demands
382.34	and you make the existing neighborhoods
384.355	all around it more complex,
385.844	more interesting, more walkable.
388.66	Here's another kind of sprawl:
391.607	China, high-density sprawl,
391.607	what you think of as an oxymoron,
395.139	but the same problems,
395.139	everything isolated in superblocks,
398.597	and of course this amazing smog
398.597	that was just spoken to.
402.149	Twelve percent of GDP
402.149	in China now is spent
405.402	on the health impacts of that.
407.623	The history, of course,
407.623	of Chinese cities is robust.
410.912	It's like any other place.
412.188	Community was all about small, local shops
415.224	and local services and walking,
415.224	interacting with your neighbors.
419.391	It may sound utopian, but it's not.
421.539	It's actually what people really want.
423.53	The new superblocks --
425.101	these are blocks that would have
425.101	5,000 units in them,
429.045	and they're gated as well,
429.045	because nobody knows anybody else.
432.881	And of course, there isn't even
432.881	a sidewalk, no ground floor shops --
436.405	a very sterile environment.
438.838	I found this one case
438.838	here in one of the superblocks
443.478	where people had illicitly set up
443.478	shops in their garages
446.728	so that they could have that kind
446.728	of local service economy.
450.45	The desire of people
450.45	to get it right is there.
455.231	We just have to get the planners
455.231	on board and the politicians.
458.982	All right. Some technical planning stuff.
462.813	Chongqing is a city of 30 million people.
466.01	It's almost as big as California.
468.397	This is a small growth area.
470.111	They wanted us to test
470.111	the alternative to sprawl
473.747	in several cities across China.
476.892	This is for four-and-a-half
476.892	million people.
480.198	What the takeaway from this image is,
482.153	every one of those circles
482.153	is a walking radius
484.826	around a transit station --
487.1	massive investment in metro and BRT,
490.764	and a distribution that allows everybody
493.12	to work within walking distance of that.
495.755	The red area, this is a blow-up.
498.076	All of a sudden, our principles
498.076	called for green space
501.257	preserving the important
501.257	ecological features.
504.971	And then those other streets in there
504.971	are auto-free streets.
509.322	So instead of bulldozing,
509.322	leveling the site
512.969	and building right up to the river,
515.056	this green edge was something
515.056	that really wasn't normative in China
519.304	until these set of practices
521.899	began experimentation there.
524.883	The urban fabric, small blocks,
526.862	maybe 500 families per block.
529.502	They know each other.
530.795	The street perimeter has shops
533.182	so there's local destinations.
535.128	And the streets themselves become smaller,
537.507	because there are more of them.
539.061	Very simple,
540.636	straightforward urban design.
543.215	Now, here you have something
543.215	I dearly love.
546.449	Think of the logic.
548.172	If only a third of the people have cars,
550.343	why do we give 100 percent
550.343	of our streets to cars?
554.748	What if we gave 70 percent of the streets
557.951	to car-free, to everybody else,
560.15	so that the transit
560.15	could move well for them,
562.419	so that they could walk,
562.419	so they could bike?
564.768	Why not have --
566.19	(Applause)
567.667	geographic equity
569.844	in our circulation system?
572.518	And quite frankly,
572.518	cities would function better.
576.3	No matter what they do,
577.614	no matter how many ring roads
577.614	they build in Beijing,
580.068	they just can't overcome
580.068	complete gridlock.
583.02	So this is an auto-free street,
583.02	mixed use along the edge.
587.486	It has transit running down the middle.
589.369	I'm happy to make that transit
589.369	autonomous vehicles,
592.497	but maybe I'll have a chance
592.497	to talk about that later.
595.431	So there are seven principles
595.431	that have now been adopted
599.178	by the highest levels
599.178	in the Chinese government,
601.902	and they're moving to implement them.
603.721	And they're simple,
604.907	and they are globally,
604.907	I think, universal principles.
607.544	One is to preserve
607.544	the natural environment, the history
611.221	and the critical agriculture.
614.126	Second is mix.
615.473	Mixed use is popular,
615.473	but when I say mixed,
618.014	I mean mixed incomes, mixed age groups
620.477	as well as mixed-land use.
624.01	Walk.
625.188	There's no great city
625.188	that you don't enjoy walking in.
628.232	You don't go there.
629.574	The places you go on vacation
629.574	are places you can walk.
632.15	Why not make it everywhere?
634.381	Bike is the most efficient
634.381	means of transportation we know.
638.326	China has now adopted policies
638.326	that put six meters of bike lane
642.098	on every street.
643.451	They're serious about getting back
643.451	to their biking history.
647.417	(Applause)
648.897	Complicated planner-ese here:
651.224	connect.
652.577	It's a street network
652.577	that allows many routes
656.113	instead of singular routes
657.948	and provides many kinds of streets
657.948	instead of just one.
662.572	Ride.
663.94	We have to invest more in transit.
666.274	There's no silver bullet.
668.073	Autonomous vehicles are not
668.073	going to solve this for us.
671.161	As a matter of fact, they're going
671.161	to generate more traffic, more VMT,
676.351	than the alternative.
677.737	And focus.
678.975	We have a hierarchy of the city
678.975	based on transit
683.155	rather than the old armature of freeways.
686.342	It's a big paradigm shift,
689.065	but those two things
689.065	have to get reconnected
691.756	in ways that really shape
691.756	the structure of the city.
697.263	So I'm very hopeful.
699.52	In California, the United States, China --
699.52	these changes are well accepted.
704.317	I'm hopeful for two reasons.
706.976	One is, most people get it.
709.079	They understand intrinsically
710.985	what a great city can and should be.
713.651	The second is that the kind of analysis
713.651	we can bring to bear now
718.516	allows people to connect the dots,
721.756	allows people to shape
721.756	political coalitions
724.749	that didn't exist in the past.
726.539	That allows them to bring into being
726.539	the kinds of communities we all need.
730.303	Thank you.
731.516	(Applause)
739.838	Chris Anderson: So, OK:
739.838	autonomous driving, self-driving cars.
743.299	A lot of people here
743.299	are very excited about them.
747.263	What are your concerns
747.263	or issues about them?
750.246	Peter Calthorpe: Well, I think
750.246	there's almost too much hype here.
753.412	First is, everybody says
753.412	we're going to get rid of a lot of cars.
757.01	What they don't say is you're going
757.01	to get a lot more vehicle miles.
760.328	You're going to get a lot more
760.328	cars moving on streets.
762.899	There will be more congestion.
764.792	CA: Because they're so appealing --
767.124	you can drive while reading or sleeping.
769.202	PC: Well, a couple of reasons.
770.723	One is, if they're privately owned,
770.723	people will travel greater distances.
774.718	It'll be a new lease on life to sprawl.
776.683	If you can work on your way to work,
778.722	you can live in more remote locations.
780.813	It'll revitalize sprawl
783.379	in a way that I'm deeply frightened.
785.736	Taxis:
787.614	about 50 percent of the surveys say
787.614	that people won't share them.
791.386	If they don't share them,
792.784	you can end up with a 90 percent
792.784	increase in vehicle miles traveled.
798.417	If you share them,
799.762	you're still at around
799.762	a 30 percent increase in VMT.
803.316	CA: Sharing them, meaning
803.316	having multiple people riding at once
806.378	in some sort of intelligent ride-sharing?
808.378	PC: Yeah, so the Uber share
808.378	without a steering wheel.
810.933	The reality is, the efficiency
810.933	of vehicles -- you can do it
814.806	with or without a steering wheel,
814.806	it doesn't matter.
817.321	They claim they're the only ones
817.321	that are going to be efficient electric,
820.838	but that's not true.
822.016	But the real bottom line
822.016	is that walking, biking and transit
825.61	are the way cities and communities thrive.
828.798	And putting people
828.798	in their private bubbles,
831.629	whether they have a steering wheel or not,
833.95	is the wrong direction.
835.545	And quite frankly,
836.72	the image of an AV on its way
836.72	to McDonald's to pick up a pack
842.423	without its owner,
844.131	just being sent off on these
844.131	kind of random errands
847.865	is really frightening to me.
849.286	CA: Well, thank you for that,
849.286	and I have to say, the images you showed
852.668	of those mixed-use streets
852.668	were really inspiring, really beautiful.
855.868	PC: Thank you.
855.868	CA: Thank you for your work.
858.051	(Applause)
