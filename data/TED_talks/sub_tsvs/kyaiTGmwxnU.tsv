12.88	Religion is more than belief.
15.64	It's power, and it's influence.
18.48	And that influence affects all of us,
21.12	every day, regardless of your own belief.
25	Despite the enormous influence
25	of religion on the world today,
29.08	we hold them to a different standard
29.08	of scrutiny and accountability
32.88	than any other sector of our society.
35.96	For example, if there were
35.96	a multinational organization,
40.4	government or corporation today
43.48	that said no female
43.48	could be on a leadership board,
47.76	not one woman could have
47.76	a decision-making authority,
51.88	not one woman could handle
51.88	any financial matter,
55.76	we would have outrage.
57.16	There would be sanctions.
58.84	And yet this is a common practice
58.84	in almost every world religion today.
64.4	We accept things in our religious lives
66.84	that we do not accept
66.84	in our secular lives,
69.96	and I know this because I've been
69.96	doing it for three decades.
74.04	I was the type of girl that fought every
74.04	form of gender discrimination growing up.
78.56	I played pickup basketball games
78.56	with the boys and inserted myself.
82.6	I said I was going to be the first
82.6	female President of the United States.
86.06	I have been fighting
86.06	for the Equal Rights Amendment,
88.52	which has been dead for 40 years.
91	I'm the first woman
91	in both sides of my family
94.16	to ever work outside the home
94.16	and ever receive a higher education.
98.36	I never accepted being excluded
98.36	because I was a woman,
103.2	except in my religion.
105.4	Throughout all of that time,
106.8	I was a part of a very patriarchal
106.8	orthodox Mormon religion.
111.12	I grew up in an enormously
111.12	traditional family.
113.92	I have eight siblings,
113.92	a stay-at-home mother.
116.08	My father's actually
116.08	a religious leader in the community.
120.16	And I grew up in a world believing
120.16	that my worth and my standing
125.04	was in keeping these rules
125.04	that I'd known my whole life.
129.12	You get married a virgin,
129.12	you never drink alcohol,
131.96	you don't smoke, you always do service,
134.36	you're a good kid.
136.36	Some of the rules we had were strict,
139.96	but you followed the rules
139.96	because you loved the people
142.6	and you loved the religion
142.6	and you believed.
145.28	Everything about Mormonism
145.28	determined what you wore,
148.12	who you dated, who you married.
149.651	It determined what underwear we wore.
153.04	I was the kind of religious
153.04	where everyone I know
156.12	donated 10 percent of everything
156.12	they earned to the church,
159.52	including myself.
160.76	From paper routes and babysitting,
160.76	I donated 10 percent.
164.72	I was the kind of religious
164.72	where I heard parents tell children
167.8	when they're leaving
167.8	on a two-year proselytizing mission
171.44	that they would rather have them die
174	than return home
174	without honor, having sinned.
177.24	I was the type and the kind of religious
179.72	where kids kill themselves
179.72	every single year
183.2	because they're terrified
183.2	of coming out to our community as gay.
187.56	But I was also the kind of religious
189.6	where it didn't matter
189.6	where in the world I lived,
192.16	I had friendship,
192.16	instantaneous mutual aid.
195.96	This was where I felt safe.
195.96	This is certainty and clarity about life.
200.2	I had help raising my little daughter.
202.48	So that's why I accepted without question
202.48	that only men can lead,
207.4	and I accepted without question
209.56	that women can't have the spiritual
209.56	authority of God on the Earth,
212.72	which we call the priesthood.
214.16	And I allowed discrepancies between
214.16	men and women in operating budgets,
218.68	disciplinary councils,
218.68	in decision-making capacities,
222.08	and I gave my religion a free pass
225.24	because I loved it.
227.12	Until I stopped,
229.12	and I realized that I had
229.12	been allowing myself to be treated
232.76	as the support staff
232.76	to the real work of men.
237.68	And I faced this contradiction in myself,
240.08	and I joined with other activists
240.08	in my community.
242.84	We've been working very, very, very hard
242.84	for the last decade and more.
247.24	The first thing we did
247.24	was raise consciousness.
249.478	You can't change what you can't see.
252	We started podcasting,
252	blogging, writing articles.
255.24	I created lists of hundreds of ways
257.8	that men and women
257.8	are unequal in our community.
260.84	The next thing we did
260.84	was build advocacy organizations.
264.36	We tried to do things
264.36	that were unignorable,
268.32	like wearing pants to church
268.32	and trying to attend all-male meetings.
273.8	These seem like simple things,
276.32	but to us, the organizers,
276.32	they were enormously costly.
280.56	We lost relationships. We lost jobs.
283.84	We got hate mail on a daily basis.
285.92	We were attacked in social media
285.92	and national press.
289.28	We received death threats.
291	We lost standing in our community.
291	Some of us got excommunicated.
295.24	Most of us got put
295.24	in front of a disciplinary council,
298.16	and were rejected
298.16	from the communities that we loved
301.32	because we wanted to make them better,
301.32	because we believed that they could be.
306.48	And I began to expect this reaction
306.48	from my own people.
309.76	I know what it feels like when you feel
309.76	like someone's trying to change you
313.72	or criticize you.
315.76	But what utterly shocked me
315.76	was throughout all of this work
319.92	I received equal measures of vitriol
319.92	from the secular left,
325.4	the same vehemence as the religious right.
329.12	And what my secular friends didn't realize
329.12	was that this religious hostility,
333	"these phrases of, ""Oh, all religious"
333	"people are crazy or stupid."""
337.16	"""Don't pay attention to religion."""
339.24	"""They're going to be"
339.24	"homophobic and sexist."""
342.6	What they didn't understand
344.68	was that that type of hostility
344.68	did not fight religious extremism,
349.28	it bred religious extremism.
352.64	Those arguments don't work,
352.64	and I know because I remember
356.08	someone telling me
356.08	that I was stupid for being Mormon.
361.8	And what it caused me to do
361.8	was defend myself and my people
365.68	and everything we believe in,
365.68	because we're not stupid.
370.72	So criticism and hostility doesn't work,
370.72	and I didn't listen to these arguments.
375.52	When I hear these arguments,
375.52	I still continue to bristle,
378.24	because I have family and friends.
379.92	These are my people,
379.92	and I'm the first to defend them,
382.64	but the struggle is real.
384.68	How do we respect
384.68	someone's religious beliefs
388.48	while still holding them accountable
388.48	for the harm or damage
391.8	that those beliefs may cause others?
394.12	It's a tough question.
394.12	I still don't have a perfect answer.
396.92	My parents and I have been walking
396.92	on this tightrope for the last decade.
401.08	They're intelligent people.
401.08	They're lovely people.
403.84	And let me try to help you
403.84	understand their perspective.
407.76	In Mormonism, we believe
407.76	that after you die,
410.76	if you keep all the rules
410.76	and you follow all the rituals,
414.12	you can be together as a family again.
417.24	And to my parents,
417.24	me doing something as simple
419.68	as having a sleeveless top right now,
419.68	showing my shoulders,
423.08	that makes me unworthy.
424.88	I won't be with my family
424.88	in the eternities.
428.24	But even more, I had a brother
428.24	die in a tragic accident at 15,
432.44	and something as simple as this
432.44	means we won't be together as a family.
436.72	And to my parents, they cannot understand
440.32	why something as simple
440.32	as fashion or women's rights
443.44	would prevent me
443.44	from seeing my brother again.
446.16	And that's the mindset
446.16	that we're dealing with,
448.92	and criticism does not change that.
452.04	And so my parents and I
452.04	have been walking this tightrope,
454.76	explaining our sides,
454.76	respecting one another,
457.72	but actually invalidating
457.72	each other's very basic beliefs
461.72	by the way we live our lives,
461.72	and it's been difficult.
465.08	The way that we've been able to do that
467.56	is to get past those defensive shells
470	and really see the soft inside
470	of unbelief and belief
474.04	and try to respect each other
474.04	while still holding boundaries clear.
478.68	The other thing that the secular left
478.68	and the atheists and the orthodox
483.16	and the religious right,
483.16	what they all don't understand
487.2	was why even care
487.2	about religious activism?
490.08	I cannot tell you the hundreds
490.08	of people who have said,
493.16	"""If you don't like religion, just leave."""
495.8	Why would you try to change it?
498.88	Because what is taught on the Sabbath
501.342	leaks into our politics,
501.342	our health policy,
504.4	violence around the world.
506.28	It leaks into education,
506.28	military, fiscal decision-making.
510	These laws get legally
510	and culturally codified.
513.32	In fact, my own religion has had
513.32	an enormous effect on this nation.
518.28	For example, during Prop 8,
518.28	my church raised over 22 million dollars
522.88	to fight same-sex marriage in California.
526.84	Forty years ago,
526.84	political historians will say,
531.08	that if it wasn't for the Mormon
531.08	opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment,
534.96	we'd have an Equal Rights Amendment
534.96	in our Constitution today.
538.8	How many lives did that affect?
542.8	And we can spend time
542.8	fighting every single one
545.6	of these little tiny laws and rules,
548.76	or we can ask ourselves,
550.36	why is gender inequality
550.36	the default around the world?
556.56	Why is that the assumption?
559.24	Because religion doesn't just
559.24	create the roots of morality,
565.2	it creates the seeds of normality.
569.28	Religions can liberate or subjugate,
572.64	they can empower or exploit,
572.64	they can comfort or destroy,
575.88	and the people that tip the scales
575.88	over to the ethical and the moral
580.44	are often not those in charge.
583.6	Religions can't be dismissed or ignored.
586.52	We need to take them seriously.
589.44	But it's not easy to influence a religion,
589.44	like we just talked about.
594	But I'll tell you
594	what my people have done.
596.24	My groups are small,
596.24	there's hundreds of us,
598.36	but we've had huge impact.
600.76	Right now, women's pictures
600.76	are hanging in the halls next to men
603.8	for the first time.
605.04	Women are now allowed
605.04	to pray in our church-wide meetings,
607.8	and they never were before
607.8	in the general conferences.
610.84	As of last week, in a historic move,
613.4	three women were invited
613.4	down to three leadership boards
616.6	that oversee the entire church.
618.6	We've seen perceptual shifts
618.6	in the Mormon community
621.44	that allow for talk of gender inequality.
623.96	We've opened up space,
623.96	regardless of being despised,
627.36	for more conservative women
627.36	to step in and make real changes,
631.28	"and the words ""women"" and ""the priesthood"""
631.28	can now be uttered in the same sentence.
636.16	I never had that.
638.8	My daughter and my nieces are inheriting
638.8	a religion that I never had,
643.4	that's more equal -- we've had an effect.
647.4	It wasn't easy standing in those lines
650.32	trying to get into those male meetings.
653.52	There were hundreds of us,
655.72	and one by one, when we got to the door,
658.36	"we were told, ""I'm sorry,"
658.36	"this meeting is just for men,"""
662.04	and we had to step back
662.04	and watch men get into the meeting
666.84	as young as 12 years old,
669	escorted and walked past us
669	as we all stood in line.
673.08	But not one woman in that line
673.08	will forget that day,
675.84	and not one little boy
675.84	that walked past us will forget that day.
681.52	If we were a multinational corporation
681.52	or a government, and that had happened,
687.16	there would be outrage,
688.8	but we're just a religion.
691.24	We're all just part of religions.
695.12	We can't keep looking
695.12	at religion that way,
697.88	because it doesn't only affect me,
697.88	it affects my daughter
700.76	and all of your daughters
700.76	and what opportunities they have,
703.76	what they can wear,
703.76	who they can love and marry,
706.038	if they have access
706.038	to reproductive healthcare.
709.16	We need to reclaim morality
709.16	in a secular context
712.52	that creates ethical scrutiny
712.52	and accountability
714.8	for religions all around the world,
717	but we need to do it in a respectful way
720.16	that breeds cooperation and not extremism.
723.4	And we can do it through
723.4	unignorable acts of bravery,
727.48	standing up for gender equality.
730.84	It's time that half
730.84	of the world's population
733.36	had voice and equality
733.36	within our world's religions,
736.32	churches, synagogues, mosques
736.32	and shrines around the world.
740.88	I'm working on my people.
740.88	What are you doing for yours?
745.4	(Applause)
