12.84	I'd like to start by asking you all
12.84	to go to your happy place, please.
17.44	Yes, your happy place,
18.68	I know you've got one even if it's fake.
20.64	(Laughter)
21.88	OK, so, comfortable?
23.2	Good.
24.44	Now I'd like to you to mentally answer
24.44	the following questions.
27.88	Is there any strip lighting
27.88	in your happy place?
31.08	Any plastic tables?
33.16	Polyester flooring?
35	Mobile phones?
36.52	No?
37.76	I think we all know that our happy place
39.689	is meant to be
39.689	somewhere natural, outdoors --
42.52	on a beach, fireside.
44.159	We'll be reading or eating or knitting.
48.28	And we're surrounded
48.28	by natural light and organic elements.
52.68	Natural things make us happy.
55.32	And happiness is a great motivator;
55.32	we strive for happiness.
59.2	Perhaps that's why
59.2	we're always redesigning everything,
61.84	in the hopes that our solutions
61.84	might feel more natural.
66.88	So let's start there --
68.36	with the idea that good design
68.36	should feel natural.
72.8	Your phone is not very natural.
77.099	And you probably think
77.099	you're addicted to your phone,
79.6	but you're really not.
81.24	We're not addicted to devices,
83.32	we're addicted to the information
83.32	that flows through them.
86.68	I wonder how long you would be
86.68	happy in your happy place
89.68	without any information
89.68	from the outside world.
93.52	I'm interested in how we access
93.52	that information,
95.84	how we experience it.
97.88	We're moving from a time
97.88	of static information,
101.92	held in books and libraries and bus stops,
104.92	through a period of digital information,
107.2	towards a period of fluid information,
109.48	where your children will expect to be able
109.48	to access anything, anywhere at any time,
115.72	from quantum physics
115.72	to medieval viticulture,
119.64	from gender theory to tomorrow's weather,
123.52	just like switching on a lightbulb --
126.68	Imagine that.
128.12	Humans also like simple tools.
131.32	Your phone is not a very simple tool.
134.48	A fork is a simple tool.
136.16	(Laughter)
137.4	And we don't like them made of plastic,
140.24	in the same way I don't really like
140.24	my phone very much --
142.931	it's not how I want
142.931	to experience information.
147.48	I think there are better solutions
147.48	than a world mediated by screens.
151.6	I don't hate screens, but I don't feel --
154.04	and I don't think any of us feel that good
156.08	about how much time
156.08	we spend slouched over them.
160.16	Fortunately,
161.44	the big tech companies seem to agree.
163.24	They're actually heavily invested
163.24	in touch and speech and gesture,
168	and also in senses --
169.8	things that can turn
169.8	dumb objects, like cups,
172.56	and imbue them with the magic
172.56	of the Internet,
176.4	potentially turning this digital cloud
178.8	into something we might touch and move.
181.88	The parents in crisis over screen time
184.52	need physical digital toys
184.52	teaching their kids to read,
187.68	as well as family-safe app stores.
191.84	And I think, actually,
191.84	that's already really happening.
195.72	Reality is richer than screens.
200.64	For example, I love books.
204.12	For me they are time machines --
204.12	atoms and molecules bound in space,
209.48	from the moment of their creation
209.48	to the moment of my experience.
213.48	But frankly,
215.04	the content's identical on my phone.
217.44	So what makes this
217.44	a richer experience than a screen?
221.8	I mean, scientifically.
225.44	We need screens, of course.
227.32	I'm going to show film,
227.32	I need the enormous screen.
232.88	But there's more than you can do
232.88	with these magic boxes.
236.88	Your phone is not
236.88	the Internet's door bitch.
239.68	(Laughter)
240.92	We can build things --
240.92	physical things,
243.8	using physics and pixels,
246.32	that can integrate the Internet
246.32	into the world around us.
249.011	And I'm going to show you
249.011	a few examples of those.
254.48	A while ago, I got to work
254.48	with a design agency, Berg,
257.44	on an exploration of what the Internet
257.44	without screens might actually look like.
262.28	And they showed us a range ways
264.36	that light can work with simple senses
264.36	and physical objects
269.32	to really bring the Internet to life,
269.32	to make it tangible.
273.64	Like this wonderfully mechanical
273.64	YouTube player.
278.56	And this was an inspiration to me.
282.6	Next I worked with
282.6	the Japanese agency, AQ,
285.56	on a research project into mental health.
287.92	We wanted to create an object
289.325	that could capture the subjective data
289.325	around mood swings
293.08	that's so essential to diagnosis.
296.04	This object captures your touch,
298.16	so you might press it
298.16	very hard if you're angry,
301.04	or stroke it if you're calm.
303.2	It's like a digital emoji stick.
305.84	And then you might revisit
305.84	those moments later,
309.04	and add context to them online.
311.16	Most of all,
312.68	we wanted to create
312.68	an intimate, beautiful thing
316.2	that could live in your pocket
318.16	and be loved.
320.753	The binoculars are actually
320.753	a birthday present
322.92	for the Sydney Opera House's
325.087	Our friends at Tellart in Boston
325.087	brought over a pair of street binoculars,
329.08	the kind you might find
329.08	on the Empire State Building,
331.581	and they fitted them with 360-degree views
334.44	of other iconic world heritage sights --
337.08	(Laughter)
338.8	using Street View.
340.84	And then we stuck them under the steps.
343.92	So, they became this very physical,
343.92	simple reappropriation,
348.64	or like a portal to these other icons.
350.72	So you might see Versailles
350.72	or Shackleton's Hut.
353.68	Basically, it's virtual
353.68	reality circa 1955.
356.76	(Laughter)
359.44	In our office we use
359.44	hacky sacks to exchange URLs.
362.92	This is incredibly simple,
362.92	it's like your Opal card.
365.72	You basically put a website
365.72	on the little chip in here,
369.52	and then you do this and ... bosh! --
373.08	the website appears on your phone.
375.44	It's about 10 cents.
377.96	Treehugger is a project
377.96	that we're working on
380.08	with Grumpy Sailor and Finch,
380.08	here in Sydney.
382.52	And I'm very excited
382.52	about what might happen
385.44	when you pull the phones apart
385.44	and you put the bits into trees,
389.28	and that my children
389.28	might have an opportunity
392.2	to visit an enchanted forest
392.2	guided by a magic wand,
396.84	where they could talk to digital fairies
396.84	and ask them questions,
399.88	and be asked questions in return.
402.12	As you can see,
403.36	we're at the cardboard stage
403.36	with this one.
405.4	(Laughter)
406.6	But I'm very excited
407.84	by the possibility of getting kids
407.84	back outside without screens,
411.76	but with all the powerful magic
411.76	of the Internet at their fingertips.
415.72	And we hope to have something like this
415.72	working by the end of the year.
421.6	So let's recap.
423.84	Humans like natural solutions.
425.88	Humans love information.
427.96	Humans need simple tools.
430.64	These principles should underpin
430.64	how we design for the future,
435.64	not just for the Internet.
438.04	You may feel uncomfortable about the age
438.04	of information that we're moving into.
443.72	You may feel challenged,
443.72	rather than simply excited.
448.2	Guess what? Me too.
450.24	It's a really extraordinary period
450.24	of human history.
455.84	We are the people
455.84	that actually build our world,
459.72	there are no artificial intelligences...
461.991	yet.
463.44	(Laughter)
465.36	It's us -- designers, architects,
465.36	artists, engineers.
470.8	And if we challenge ourselves,
473.32	I think that actually
473.32	we can have a happy place
477.28	filled with the information we love
479.8	that feels as natural and as simple
479.8	as switching on lightbulb.
484.64	And although it may seem inevitable,
486.379	that what the public wants
486.379	is watches and websites and widgets,
491.76	maybe we could give a bit of thought
491.76	to cork and light and hacky sacks.
497.96	Thank you very much.
499.32	(Applause)
