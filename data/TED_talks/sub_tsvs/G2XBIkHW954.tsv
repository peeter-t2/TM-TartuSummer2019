16.284	I want you to take a look at this baby.
19.439	What you're drawn to are her eyes
19.439	and the skin you love to touch.
24.646	But today I'm going to talk to you
24.646	about something you can't see.
27.81	What's going on
27.81	up in that little brain of hers.
31.395	The modern tools of neuroscience
31.395	are demonstrating to us
35.34	that what's going on up there
35.34	is nothing short of rocket science.
39.996	And what we're learning
39.996	is going to shed some light
43.457	on what the romantic writers and poets
43.457	"described as the ""celestial openness"""
49.379	of the child's mind.
52.273	What we see here is a mother in India,
55.755	and she's speaking Koro,
55.755	which is a newly discovered language.
60.057	And she's talking to her baby.
62.349	What this mother --
63.529	and the 800 people who speak
63.529	Koro in the world --
66.772	understands is that,
66.772	to preserve this language,
70.006	they need to speak it to the babies.
72.616	And therein lies a critical puzzle.
75.515	Why is it that you can't
75.515	preserve a language
77.789	by speaking to you and I, to the adults?
81.048	Well, it's got to do with your brain.
83.798	What we see here is that language
83.798	has a critical period for learning.
88.26	The way to read this slide is to look
88.26	at your age on the horizontal axis.
92.084	(Laughter)
94.791	And you'll see on the vertical
94.791	your skill at acquiring a second language.
99.049	The babies and children are geniuses
99.049	until they turn seven,
102.932	and then there's a systematic decline.
105.26	After puberty, we fall off the map.
108.194	No scientists dispute this curve,
110.75	but laboratories all over the world
112.729	are trying to figure out
112.729	why it works this way.
115.778	Work in my lab is focused on the first
115.778	critical period in development,
119.836	and that is the period in which babies
121.705	try to master which sounds
121.705	are used in their language.
125.094	We think, by studying
125.094	how the sounds are learned,
127.608	we'll have a model
127.608	for the rest of language,
129.897	and perhaps for critical periods
129.897	that may exist in childhood
132.859	for social, emotional
132.859	and cognitive development.
136.295	So we've been studying the babies
138.26	using a technique
138.26	that we're using all over the world
140.787	and the sounds of all languages.
142.667	The baby sits on a parent's lap,
144.482	and we train them to turn
144.482	their heads when a sound changes --
147.427	"like from ""ah"" to ""ee."""
148.909	If they do so at the appropriate time,
148.909	the black box lights up
152.366	and a panda bear pounds a drum.
154.374	A six-monther adores the task.
157.42	What have we learned?
158.605	Well, babies all over the world
160.789	are what I like to describe
160.789	"as ""citizens of the world."""
164.906	They can discriminate
164.906	all the sounds of all languages,
167.858	no matter what country we're testing
167.858	and what language we're using,
171.114	and that's remarkable
171.114	because you and I can't do that.
174.133	We're culture-bound listeners.
176.128	We can discriminate the sounds
176.128	of our own language,
178.547	but not those of foreign languages.
180.418	So the question arises:
180.418	When do those citizens of the world
183.609	turn into the language-bound
183.609	listeners that we are?
186.517	And the answer:
186.517	before their first birthdays.
189.678	What you see here is performance
189.678	on that head-turn task
192.834	for babies tested in Tokyo
192.834	and the United States,
195.321	here in Seattle,
196.783	"as they listened to ""ra"" and ""la"" --"
198.556	sounds important to English,
198.556	but not to Japanese.
201.386	So at six to eight months,
201.386	the babies are totally equivalent.
204.788	Two months later,
204.788	something incredible occurs.
207.366	The babies in the United States
207.366	are getting a lot better,
210.07	babies in Japan are getting a lot worse,
212.018	but both of those groups of babies
212.018	are preparing for exactly the language
215.492	that they are going to learn.
217.008	So the question is: What's happening
217.008	during this critical two-month period?
221.656	This is the critical period
221.656	for sound development,
224.023	but what's going on up there?
225.462	So there are two things going on.
227.465	The first is that the babies
227.465	are listening intently to us,
230.365	and they're taking statistics
230.365	as they listen to us talk --
234.122	they're taking statistics.
236.127	So listen to two mothers
236.127	speaking motherese --
238.69	the universal language
238.69	we use when we talk to kids --
241.756	first in English and then in Japanese.
243.991	(Video) Ah, I love your big blue eyes --
247.454	so pretty and nice.
251.309	(Japanese)
257.712	Patricia Kuhl: During the production
257.712	of speech, when babies listen,
261.103	what they're doing is taking statistics
261.103	on the language that they hear.
266.613	And those distributions grow.
269.547	And what we've learned is that babies
269.547	are sensitive to the statistics,
273.944	and the statistics of Japanese
273.944	and English are very, very different.
277.796	English has a lot of Rs and Ls.
280.477	The distribution shows.
282.26	And the distribution of Japanese
282.26	is totally different,
285.124	where we see a group
285.124	of intermediate sounds,
288.149	"which is known as the Japanese ""R."""
290.588	So babies absorb
290.588	the statistics of the language
294.72	and it changes their brains;
296.422	it changes them
296.422	from the citizens of the world
298.597	to the culture-bound
298.597	listeners that we are.
301.567	But we as adults are no longer
301.567	absorbing those statistics.
306.304	We are governed
306.304	by the representations in memory
308.885	that were formed early in development.
311.458	So what we're seeing here
313.26	is changing our models
313.26	of what the critical period is about.
316.517	We're arguing from
316.517	a mathematical standpoint
319.31	that the learning of language
319.31	material may slow down
322.474	when our distributions stabilize.
324.878	It's raising lots of questions
324.878	about bilingual people.
328.178	Bilinguals must keep two sets
328.178	of statistics in mind at once
332.233	and flip between them,
332.233	one after the other,
335.14	depending on who they're speaking to.
336.936	So we asked ourselves,
338.114	can the babies take statistics
338.114	on a brand new language?
341.545	And we tested this
341.545	by exposing American babies
344.847	who'd never heard a second language
346.56	to Mandarin for the first time
346.56	during the critical period.
349.3	We knew that, when monolinguals
349.3	were tested in Taipei and Seattle
352.861	on the Mandarin sounds,
352.861	they showed the same pattern.
355.547	Six to eight months,
355.547	they're totally equivalent.
358.042	Two months later,
358.042	something incredible happens.
360.602	But the Taiwanese babies are getting
360.602	better, not the American babies.
364.178	What we did was expose American babies,
364.178	during this period, to Mandarin.
369.084	It was like having Mandarin relatives
369.084	come and visit for a month
372.116	and move into your house
372.116	and talk to the babies for 12 sessions.
375.937	Here's what it looked like
375.937	in the laboratory.
378.167	(Mandarin)
399.922	PK: So what have we done
399.922	to their little brains?
402.192	(Laughter)
404.26	We had to run a control group to make sure
406.955	that coming into the laboratory
406.955	didn't improve your Mandarin skills.
410.191	So a group of babies came in
410.191	and listened to English.
412.868	And we can see from the graph
414.294	that exposure to English
414.294	didn't improve their Mandarin.
416.901	But look at what happened to the babies
416.901	exposed to Mandarin for 12 sessions.
420.52	They were as good as the babies in Taiwan
422.944	who'd been listening
422.944	for 10 and a half months.
425.944	What it demonstrated is that babies
425.944	take statistics on a new language.
429.792	Whatever you put in front of them,
429.792	they'll take statistics on.
433.26	But we wondered what role
434.874	the human being played
434.874	in this learning exercise.
439.428	So we ran another group of babies
439.428	in which the kids got the same dosage,
443.768	the same 12 sessions,
443.768	but over a television set.
446.26	And another group of babies
446.26	who had just audio exposure
449.945	and looked at a teddy bear on the screen.
452.057	What did we do to their brains?
454.26	What you see here is the audio result --
458.183	no learning whatsoever --
459.945	and the video result --
462.496	no learning whatsoever.
464.365	It takes a human being
464.365	for babies to take their statistics.
468.882	The social brain is controlling
471.072	when the babies
471.072	are taking their statistics.
473.201	We want to get inside the brain
473.201	and see this thing happening
476.718	as babies are in front of televisions,
476.718	as opposed to in front of human beings.
480.68	Thankfully, we have a new machine,
480.68	magnetoencephalography,
485.401	that allows us to do this.
486.718	It looks like a hair dryer from Mars.
489.327	But it's completely safe,
489.327	completely noninvasive and silent.
493.834	We're looking at millimeter accuracy
496.301	with regard to spatial
496.301	and millisecond accuracy
499.641	using 306 SQUIDs --
502.287	these are superconducting
502.287	quantum interference devices --
505.411	to pick up the magnetic fields
505.411	that change as we do our thinking.
509.509	We're the first in the world
509.509	to record babies in an MEG machine
515.142	while they are learning.
517.557	So this is little Emma.
519.26	She's a six-monther.
521.192	And she's listening to various languages
521.192	in the earphones that are in her ears.
526.334	You can see, she can move around.
528.582	We're tracking her head
528.582	with little pellets in a cap,
532.376	so she's free to move
532.376	completely unconstrained.
535.375	It's a technical tour de force.
537.612	What are we seeing?
539.22	We're seeing the baby brain.
541.138	As the baby hears a word in her language,
541.138	the auditory areas light up,
546.448	and then subsequently areas surrounding it
546.448	that we think are related to coherence,
551.26	getting the brain coordinated
551.26	with its different areas, and causality,
555.26	one brain area
555.26	causing another to activate.
558.861	We are embarking on a grand
558.861	and golden age of knowledge
564.269	about child's brain development.
566.529	We're going to be able
566.529	to see a child's brain
568.974	as they experience an emotion,
568.974	as they learn to speak and read,
573.239	as they solve a math problem,
573.239	as they have an idea.
576.775	And we're going to be able to invent
576.775	brain-based interventions
580.148	for children who have difficulty learning.
582.831	Just as the poets and writers described,
585.921	we're going to be able to see, I think,
585.921	that wondrous openness,
590.099	utter and complete openness,
590.099	of the mind of a child.
594.284	In investigating the child's brain,
596.984	we're going to uncover deep truths
596.984	about what it means to be human,
601.004	and in the process,
602.183	we may be able to help keep
602.183	our own minds open to learning
605.278	for our entire lives.
606.993	Thank you.
608.26	(Applause)
