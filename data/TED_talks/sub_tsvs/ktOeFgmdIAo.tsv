12.74	Most of you can probably relate
12.74	to what I'm feeling right now.
16.992	My heart is racing in my chest.
19.715	My palms are a little bit clammy.
22.676	I'm sweating.
24.643	And my breath is a little bit shallow.
27.318	Now, these familiar sensations
27.318	are obviously the result
30.202	of standing up
30.202	in front of a thousand of you
32.609	and giving a talk
32.609	that might be streamed online
34.894	to perhaps a million more.
37.086	But the physical sensations
37.086	I'm experiencing right now
39.689	are actually the result of a much more
39.689	basic mind-body mechanism.
44.218	My nervous system is sending
44.218	a flood of hormones
47.545	like cortisol and adrenaline
47.545	into my bloodstream.
51.053	It's a very old and very necessary
51.053	response that sends blood and oxygen
55.842	to the organs and muscles
55.842	that I might need
57.945	to respond quickly to a potential threat.
61.026	But there's a problem with this response,
63.08	and that is, it can get over-activated.
66.234	If I face these kinds of stressors
66.234	on a daily basis,
69.268	particularly over an extended
69.268	period of time,
72.711	my system can get overloaded.
75.415	So basically, if this response
75.415	happens infrequently: super-necessary
79.108	for my well-being and survival.
81.384	But if it happens too much,
82.945	it can actually make me sick.
85.57	There's a growing body of research
85.57	examining the relationship
88.503	between chronic stress and illness.
90.613	Things like heart disease and even cancer
92.726	are being shown to have
92.726	a relationship to stress.
95.794	And that's because, over time,
95.794	too much activation from stress
99.834	can interfere with my body's processes
99.834	that keep me healthy.
104.793	Now, let's imagine for a moment
104.793	that I was pregnant.
108.426	What might this kind of stress,
110.397	particularly over the length
110.397	of my pregnancy,
112.69	what kind of impact might that have
114.554	on the health of my developing fetus?
118.176	You probably won't be surprised
118.176	when I tell you
120.537	that this kind of stress
120.537	during pregnancy is not good.
123.935	It can even cause the body
123.935	to initiate labor too early,
127.59	because in a basic sense,
127.59	the stress communicates
130.28	that the womb is no longer
130.28	a safe place for the child.
134.171	Stress during pregnancy is linked
134.171	with things like high blood pressure
137.554	and low infant birth weight,
139.237	and it can begin a cascade
139.237	of health challenges
141.453	that make birth much more dangerous
143.64	for both parent and child.
146.954	Now of course stress,
146.954	particularly in our modern lifestyle,
150.03	is a somewhat universal experience, right?
152.344	Maybe you've never stood up
152.344	to give a TED Talk,
154.708	but you've faced a big
154.708	presentation at work,
157.386	a sudden job loss,
158.978	a big test,
160.315	a heated conflict
160.315	with a family member or friend.
163.756	But it turns out that the kind
163.756	of stress we experience
166.916	and whether we're able to stay
166.916	in a relaxed state long enough
170.154	to keep our bodies working properly
172.229	depends a lot on who we are.
175.255	There's also a growing body of research
177.14	showing that people who experience
177.14	more discrimination
181.142	are more likely to have poor health.
183.841	Even the threat of discrimination,
186.155	like worrying you might be stopped
186.155	by police while driving your car,
189.621	can have a negative impact on your health.
194.687	Harvard Professor Dr. David Williams,
197.29	the person who pioneered
197.29	the tools that have proven these linkages,
200.781	says that the more marginalized
200.781	groups in our society
203.758	experience more discrimination
203.758	and more impacts on their health.
208.522	I've been interested in these issues
208.522	for over a decade.
211.658	I became interested in maternal health
214.49	when a failed premed trajectory
214.49	instead sent me down a path
218.259	looking for other ways
218.259	to help pregnant people.
220.752	I became a doula,
222.2	a lay person trained to provide support
224.247	to people during pregnancy and childbirth.
226.391	And because I'm Latina
226.391	and a Spanish speaker,
228.999	in my first volunteer doula gig
228.999	at a public hospital in North Carolina,
232.932	I saw clearly how race and class
232.932	impacted the experiences
236.279	of the women that I supported.
238.669	If we take a look at the statistics
238.669	about the rates of illness
242.028	during pregnancy and childbirth,
243.855	we see clearly the pattern
243.855	outlined by Dr. Williams.
247.533	African-American women in particular
249.806	have an entirely different
249.806	experience than white women
252.739	when it comes to whether
252.739	their babies are born healthy.
256.308	In certain parts of the country,
256.308	particularly the Deep South,
259.416	the rates of mother
259.416	and infant death for black women
262.153	actually approximate
262.153	those rates in Sub-Saharan African.
266.64	In those same communities,
268.285	the rates for white women are near zero.
272.54	Even nationally, black women
272.54	are four times more likely
276.159	to die during pregnancy and childbirth
278.475	than white women.
280.072	Four times more likely to die.
283.092	They're also twice as likely
283.092	for their infants to die
286.035	before the first year of life
287.64	than white infants,
289.195	and two to three times more likely
291.136	to give birth too early or too skinny --
294.076	a sign of insufficient development.
296.737	Native women are also more likely
296.737	to have higher rates of these problems
300.878	than white women,
302.1	as are some groups of Latinas.
305.145	For the last decade as a doula
305.145	turned journalist and blogger,
308.13	I've been trying to raise the alarm
309.869	about just how different
309.869	the experiences of women of color,
312.864	but particularly black women,
314.343	are when it comes to pregnancy
314.343	and birth in the US.
317.166	But when I tell people
317.166	about these appalling statistics,
320.086	I'm usually met with an assumption
320.086	that it's about either poverty
323.841	or lack of access to care.
326.041	But it turns out, neither of these things
326.041	tell the whole story.
329.388	Even middle-class black women
329.388	still have much worse outcomes
333.924	than their middle-class
333.924	white counterparts.
336.882	The gap actually widens among this group.
340.374	And while access to care
340.374	is definitely still a problem,
343.917	even women of color who receive
343.917	the recommended prenatal care
347.38	still suffer from these high rates.
350.249	And so we come back to the path
352.128	from discrimination to stress
352.128	to poor health,
356.303	and it begins to paint a picture
356.303	that many people of color know to be true:
360.524	racism is actually making us sick.
364.108	Still sound like a stretch?
365.796	Consider this: immigrants,
365.796	particularly black and Latina immigrants,
370.104	actually have better health when
370.104	they first arrive in the United States.
373.667	But the longer they stay in this country,
373.667	the worse their health becomes.
378.256	People like me, born in the United States
378.256	to Cuban immigrant parents,
382.392	are actually more likely to have
382.392	worse health than my grandparents did.
386.549	It's what researchers call
386.549	"""the immigrant paradox,"""
389.075	and it further illustrates
390.383	that there's something
390.383	in the US environment
392.61	that is making us sick.
394.5	But here's the thing:
395.689	this problem, that racism
395.689	is making people of color,
398.78	but especially black
398.78	women and babies, sick, is vast.
401.485	I could spend all of my time
401.485	with you talking about it,
404.279	but I won't, because I want to make sure
404.279	to tell you about one solution.
407.958	And the good news is, it's a solution
407.958	that isn't particularly expensive,
411.415	and doesn't require
411.415	any fancy drug treatments
413.905	or new technologies.
415.115	"The solution is called, ""The JJ Way."""
419.309	Meet Jennie Joseph.
421.245	She's a midwife
421.245	in the Orlando, Florida area
423.816	who has been serving
423.816	pregnant women for over a decade.
427.072	In what she calls her easy-access clinics,
429.513	Jennie and her team provide prenatal care
429.513	to over 600 women per year.
434.692	Her clients, most of whom are black,
434.692	Haitian and Latina,
439.443	deliver at the local hospital.
441.441	But by providing accessible
441.441	and respectful prenatal care,
445.492	Jennie has achieved something remarkable:
448.016	almost all of her clients give birth
448.016	to healthy, full-term babies.
453.285	Her method is deceptively simple.
455.696	Jennie says that all of her appointments
455.696	start at the front desk.
458.896	Every member of her team,
458.896	and every moment a women is at her clinic,
462.66	is as supportive as possible.
465.213	No one is turned away
465.213	due to lack of funds.
467.639	The JJ Way is to make the finances work
467.639	no matter what the hurdles.
471.8	No one is chastised for showing up
471.8	late to their appointments.
474.818	No one is talked down to or belittled.
477.594	Jennie's waiting room feels more like
477.594	your aunt's living room than a clinic.
481.855	She calls this space
481.855	"""a classroom in disguise."""
485.512	With the plush chairs
485.512	arranged in a circle,
487.935	women wait for their appointments
487.935	in one-on-one chats
490.619	with a staff educator,
491.876	or in group prenatal classes.
494.569	When you finally are called back
494.569	to your appointment,
497.128	you are greeted by Alexis or Trina,
498.999	two of Jennie's medical assistants.
500.912	Both are young, African-American
500.912	and moms themselves.
504.455	Their approach is casual and friendly.
507.125	During one visit I observed,
508.924	Trina chatted with a young soon-to-be mom
511.875	while she took her blood pressure.
513.77	This Latina mom was having trouble
513.77	keeping food down due to nausea.
518.185	As Trina deflated the blood pressure cuff,
520.257	"she said, ""We'll see about changing"
520.257	your prescription, OK?
523.099	"We can't have you not eating."""
525.531	"That ""we"" is actually a really crucial"
525.531	aspect of Jennie's model.
529.604	She sees her staff as part of a team that,
529.604	alongside the woman and her family,
534.387	has one goal:
535.785	get mom to term with a healthy baby.
539.089	Jennie says that Trina and Alexis
539.089	are actually the center of her care model,
542.802	and that her role as a provider
542.802	is just to support their work.
547.17	Trina spends a lot of her day
547.17	on her cell phone,
549.468	texting with clients
549.468	about all sorts of things.
551.904	One woman texted to ask if a medication
551.904	she was prescribed at the hospital
555.805	was OK to take while pregnant.
557.767	The answer was no.
559.468	Another woman texted with pictures
559.468	of an infant born under Jennie's care.
564.339	Lastly, when you finally are called back
564.339	to see the provider,
567.694	you've already taken your own weight
567.694	in the waiting room,
570.447	and done your own pee test
570.447	in the bathroom.
572.849	This is a big departure
572.849	from the traditional medical model,
575.712	because it places
575.712	responsibility and information
578.624	back in the woman's hands.
580.959	So rather than a medical setting
580.959	where you might be chastised
583.92	for not keeping up
583.92	with provider recommendations --
586.396	the kind of settings often available
586.396	to low-income women --
589.466	Jennie's model is to be
589.466	as supportive as possible.
592.997	And that support provides a crucial buffer
596.038	to the stress of racism and discrimination
596.038	facing these women every day.
602.008	But here's the best thing
602.008	about Jennie's model:
605.219	it's been incredibly successful.
608.195	Remember those statistics I told you,
610.03	that black women are more likely
610.03	to give birth too early,
612.81	to give birth to low birth weight babies,
614.986	to even die due to complications
614.986	of pregnancy and childbirth?
618.54	Well, The JJ Way has almost entirely
618.54	eliminated those problems,
622.429	starting with what Jennie calls
622.429	"""skinny babies."""
625.492	She's been able to get almost all
625.492	her clients to term
628.114	with healthy, chunky babies like this one.
631.768	Audience: Aw!
634.14	Miriam Zoila Pérez:
634.14	This is a baby girl
636.421	born to a client of Jennie's
636.421	this past June.
639.794	A similar demographic
639.794	of women in Jennie's area
642.412	who gave birth at the same
642.412	hospital her clients did
645.308	were three times more likely to give birth
647.92	to a baby below a healthy weight.
650.677	Jennie is making headway
650.677	into what has been seen for decades
653.759	as an almost intractable problem.
656.928	Some of you might be thinking,
658.618	all this one-on-one attention
658.618	that The JJ Way requires
661.263	must be too expensive to scale.
663.622	Well, you'd be wrong.
665.102	The visit with the provider
665.102	is not the center of Jennie's model,
668.709	and for good reason.
670.264	Those visits are expensive,
670.264	and in order to maintain her model,
673.389	she's got to see a lot
673.389	of clients to cover costs.
675.906	But Jennie doesn't have to spend
675.906	a ton of time with each woman,
679.023	if all of the members of her team
679.023	can provide the support, information
683.469	and care that her clients need.
686.55	The beauty of Jennie's model
686.55	is that she actually believes
689.589	it can be implemented
689.589	in pretty much any health care setting.
692.828	It's a revolution in care
692.828	just waiting to happen.
697.225	These problems I've been sharing
697.225	with you are big.
699.689	They come from long histories
699.689	of racism, classism,
703.125	a society based on race
703.125	and class stratification.
706.037	They involve elaborate
706.037	physiological mechanisms
708.457	meant to protect us,
709.636	that, when overstimulated,
709.636	actually make us sick.
712.576	But if there's one thing I've learned
712.576	from my work as a doula,
715.562	it's that a little bit of unconditional
715.562	support can go a really long way.
719.428	History has shown that people
719.428	are incredibly resilient,
722.321	and while we can't eradicate racism
724.228	or the stress that results
724.228	from it overnight,
726.514	we might just be able to create
726.514	environments that provide a buffer
729.738	to what people of color
729.738	experience on a daily basis.
732.624	And during pregnancy,
732.624	that buffer can be an incredible tool
735.878	towards shifting the impact of racism
738.071	for generations to come.
739.942	Thank you.
741.178	(Applause)
