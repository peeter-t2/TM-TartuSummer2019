12.9	The last time I heard my son's voice
15.42	was when he walked out the front door
17.78	on his way to school.
20.3	He called out one word in the darkness:
23.14	"""Bye."""
24.82	It was April 20, 1999.
28.7	Later that morning,
28.7	at Columbine High School,
31.78	my son Dylan and his friend Eric
34.74	killed 12 students and a teacher
38.1	and wounded more than 20 others
38.1	before taking their own lives.
42.98	Thirteen innocent people were killed,
46.06	leaving their loved ones
46.06	in a state of grief and trauma.
50.14	Others sustained injuries,
52.02	some resulting in disfigurement
52.02	and permanent disability.
57.66	But the enormity of the tragedy
59.5	can't be measured only by the number
59.5	of deaths and injuries that took place.
64.54	There's no way to quantify
64.54	the psychological damage
67.98	of those who were in the school,
69.94	or who took part
69.94	in rescue or cleanup efforts.
74.1	There's no way to assess
74.1	the magnitude of a tragedy like Columbine,
78.5	especially when it can be a blueprint
80.78	for other shooters who go on
80.78	to commit atrocities of their own.
85.42	Columbine was a tidal wave,
88.02	and when the crash ended,
89.3	it would take years
89.3	for the community and for society
93.26	to comprehend its impact.
96.54	It has taken me years
96.54	to try to accept my son's legacy.
101.58	The cruel behavior
101.58	that defined the end of his life
104.74	showed me that he was a completely
104.74	different person from the one I knew.
109.42	Afterwards people asked,
111.82	"""How could you not know?"
114.38	"What kind of a mother were you?"""
117.06	I still ask myself those same questions.
120.9	Before the shootings,
120.9	I thought of myself as a good mom.
124.58	Helping my children become caring,
127.06	healthy, responsible adults
129.42	was the most important role of my life.
133.58	But the tragedy convinced me
133.58	that I failed as a parent,
137.66	and it's partially this sense of failure
137.66	that brings me here today.
143.06	Aside from his father,
144.34	I was the one person
144.34	who knew and loved Dylan the most.
148.62	If anyone could have known
148.62	what was happening,
150.9	it should have been me, right?
153.82	But I didn't know.
157.26	Today, I'm here to share the experience
159.18	of what it's like to be the mother
159.18	of someone who kills and hurts.
164.02	For years after the tragedy,
164.02	I combed through memories,
167.9	trying to figure out
167.9	exactly where I failed as a parent.
172.1	But there are no simple answers.
174.86	I can't give you any solutions.
177.34	All I can do
179.58	is share what I have learned.
183.26	When I talk to people
183.26	who didn't know me before the shootings,
186.9	I have three challenges to meet.
189.46	First, when I walk into a room like this,
193.3	I never know if someone there
193.3	has experienced loss
196.9	because of what my son did.
199.9	I feel a need to acknowledge the suffering
199.9	caused by a member of my family
204.06	who isn't here to do it for himself.
206.9	So first, with all of my heart,
210.14	I'm sorry if my son has caused you pain.
215.46	The second challenge I have
217.86	is that I must ask for understanding
217.86	and even compassion
222.38	when I talk about
222.38	my son's death as a suicide.
226.3	Two years before he died,
228.46	he wrote on a piece of paper in a notebook
230.7	that he was cutting himself.
233.02	He said that he was in agony
234.66	and wanted to get a gun
234.66	so he could end his life.
237.98	I didn't know about any of this
237.98	until months after his death.
242.54	When I talk about his death as a suicide,
245.98	I'm not trying to downplay the viciousness
245.98	he showed at the end of his life.
250.66	I'm trying to understand
252.66	how his suicidal thinking
254.78	led to murder.
256.9	After a lot of reading
256.9	and talking with experts,
260.14	I have come to believe
261.82	that his involvement in the shootings
261.82	was rooted not in his desire to kill
267.3	but in his desire to die.
270.14	The third challenge I have
270.14	when I talk about my son's murder-suicide
275.46	is that I'm talking about mental health --
279.5	excuse me --
280.74	is that I'm talking about mental health,
283.38	or brain health, as I prefer to call it,
283.38	because it's more concrete.
287.58	And in the same breath,
287.58	I'm talking about violence.
291.34	The last thing I want to do
291.34	is to contribute to the misunderstanding
294.94	that already exists around mental illness.
298.18	Only a very small percent of those
298.18	who have a mental illness
302.98	are violent toward other people,
306.62	but of those who die by suicide,
309.78	it's estimated that about 75
309.78	to maybe more than 90 percent
314.02	have a diagnosable
314.02	mental health condition of some kind.
318.5	As you all know very well,
319.78	our mental health care system
319.78	is not equipped to help everyone,
323.82	and not everyone with destructive thoughts
326.34	fits the criteria
328.1	for a specific diagnosis.
331.02	Many who have ongoing feelings
333.06	of fear or anger or hopelessness
336.82	are never assessed or treated.
339.46	Too often, they get our attention
339.46	only if they reach a behavioral crisis.
345.22	If estimates are correct
347.3	that about one
347.3	to two percent of all suicides
350.26	involves the murder of another person,
353.9	when suicide rates rise,
353.9	as they are rising for some populations,
358.54	the murder-suicide rates
358.54	will rise as well.
362.34	I wanted to understand what was going on
362.34	in Dylan's mind prior to his death,
367.86	so I looked for answers
367.86	from other survivors of suicide loss.
373.46	I did research and volunteered
373.46	to help with fund-raising events,
378.02	and whenever I could,
379.82	I talked with those who had
379.82	survived their own suicidal crisis
384.34	or attempt.
386.66	One of the most helpful
386.66	conversations I had
388.9	was with a coworker
390.38	who overheard me talking to someone else
392.309	in my office cubicle.
394.58	She heard me say
394.58	that Dylan could not have loved me
398.02	if he could do something
398.02	as horrible as he did.
401.82	Later, when she found me alone,
404.58	she apologized for overhearing
404.58	that conversation,
407.06	but told me that I was wrong.
409.7	She said that when she was
409.7	a young, single mother
412.34	with three small children,
414.42	she became severely depressed
414.42	and was hospitalized to keep her safe.
419.82	At the time, she was certain
422.14	that her children
422.14	would be better off if she died,
425.42	so she had made a plan to end her life.
428.7	She assured me that a mother's love
428.7	was the strongest bond on Earth,
432.78	and that she loved her children
432.78	more than anything in the world,
436.46	but because of her illness,
438.7	she was sure that they
438.7	would be better off without her.
443.5	What she said and what
443.5	I've learned from others
445.9	is that we do not make
445.9	the so-called decision or choice
450.66	to die by suicide
452.26	in the same way
452.26	that we choose what car to drive
455.14	or where to go on a Saturday night.
458.18	When someone is
458.18	in an extremely suicidal state,
461.3	they are in a stage four
461.3	medical health emergency.
466.5	Their thinking is impaired and they've
466.5	lost access to tools of self-governance.
472.14	Even though they can
472.14	make a plan and act with logic,
475.34	their sense of truth
475.34	is distorted by a filter of pain
479.3	through which they
479.3	interpret their reality.
482.7	Some people can be very good
482.7	at hiding this state,
486.38	and they often have
486.38	good reasons for doing that.
490.66	Many of us have
490.66	suicidal thoughts at some point,
493.86	but persistent,
493.86	ongoing thoughts of suicide
497.38	and devising a means to die
499.62	are symptoms of pathology,
501.98	and like many illnesses,
503.9	the condition has to be
503.9	recognized and treated
507.34	before a life is lost.
510.42	But my son's death
510.42	was not purely a suicide.
514.02	It involved mass murder.
516.9	I wanted to know how his
516.9	suicidal thinking became homicidal.
523.74	But research is sparse
523.74	and there are no simple answers.
528.06	Yes, he probably had ongoing depression.
532.499	He had a personality
532.499	that was perfectionistic and self-reliant,
538.94	and that made him less likely
538.94	to seek help from others.
543.7	He had experienced
543.7	triggering events at the school
547.18	that left him feeling
547.18	debased and humiliated and mad.
553.98	And he had a complicated friendship
557.26	with a boy who shared his feelings
557.26	of rage and alienation,
561.62	and who was seriously disturbed,
564.74	controlling and homicidal.
568.1	And on top of this period in his life
570.98	of extreme vulnerability and fragility,
575.1	Dylan found access to guns
577.5	even though we'd never
577.5	owned any in our home.
580.62	It was appallingly easy
580.62	for a 17-year-old boy to buy guns,
585.86	both legally and illegally,
585.86	without my permission or knowledge.
591.7	And somehow, 17 years
591.7	and many school shootings later,
596.9	it's still appallingly easy.
600.98	What Dylan did that day broke my heart,
605.06	and as trauma so often does,
606.94	it took a toll on my body and on my mind.
611.18	Two years after the shootings,
611.18	I got breast cancer,
615.02	and two years after that,
615.02	I began to have mental health problems.
620.3	On top of the constant, perpetual grief
623.74	I was terrified that I would run
623.74	into a family member
627.34	of someone Dylan had killed,
629.42	or be accosted by the press
631.82	or by an angry citizen.
634.74	I was afraid to turn on the news,
637.34	afraid to hear myself being called
637.34	a terrible parent or a disgusting person.
645.14	I started having panic attacks.
649.06	The first bout started
649.06	four years after the shootings,
653.26	when I was getting ready
653.26	for the depositions
655.82	and would have to meet
655.82	the victims' families face to face.
659.42	The second round started
659.42	six years after the shootings,
662.82	when I was preparing
662.82	to speak publicly about murder-suicide
666.3	for the first time at a conference.
669.34	Both episodes lasted several weeks.
673.98	The attacks happened everywhere:
676.14	in the hardware store, in my office,
679.46	or even while reading a book in bed.
682.42	My mind would suddenly lock
682.42	into this spinning cycle of terror
687.5	and no matter how I hard I tried
689.62	to calm myself down
689.62	or reason my way out of it,
693.7	I couldn't do it.
696.26	It felt as if my brain
696.26	was trying to kill me,
699.74	and then, being afraid of being afraid
702.34	consumed all of my thoughts.
705.02	That's when I learned firsthand
706.94	what it feels like
706.94	to have a malfunctioning mind,
710.46	and that's when I truly
710.46	became a brain health advocate.
715.58	With therapy and medication and self-care,
718.58	life eventually returned
720.42	to whatever could be thought of
720.42	as normal under the circumstances.
725.06	When I looked back
725.06	on all that had happened,
727.14	I could see that my son's
727.14	spiral into dysfunction
731.5	probably occurred
731.5	over a period of about two years,
735.02	plenty of time to get him help,
738.1	if only someone had known
738.1	that he needed help
741.14	and known what to do.
747.5	Every time someone asks me,
750.1	"""How could you not have known?"","
752.58	it feels like a punch in the gut.
755.66	It carries accusation
755.66	and taps into my feelings of guilt
760.22	that no matter how much therapy I've had
762.74	I will never fully eradicate.
765.7	But here's something I've learned:
768.54	if love were enough
770.42	to stop someone who is suicidal
772.58	from hurting themselves,
774.82	suicides would hardly ever happen.
778.14	But love is not enough,
781.06	and suicide is prevalent.
783.5	It's the second leading cause of death
786.34	for people age 10 to 34,
789.46	and 15 percent of American youth
792.14	report having made a suicide plan
794.9	in the last year.
797.98	I've learned that no matter
797.98	how much we want to believe we can,
802.82	we cannot know or control
805.66	everything our loved ones think and feel,
808.58	and the stubborn belief
808.58	that we are somehow different,
812.38	that someone we love
812.38	would never think of hurting themselves
815.82	or someone else,
817.9	can cause us to miss
819.94	what's hidden in plain sight.
823.66	And if worst case scenarios
823.66	do come to pass,
828.34	we'll have to learn
828.34	to forgive ourselves for not knowing
832.26	or for not asking the right questions
834.98	or not finding the right treatment.
839.06	We should always assume
840.34	that someone we love may be suffering,
843.7	regardless of what they say
846.34	or how they act.
848.54	We should listen with our whole being,
851.62	without judgments,
853.5	and without offering solutions.
859.18	I know that I will live with this tragedy,
862.42	with these multiple tragedies,
864.38	for the rest of my life.
867.14	I know that in the minds of many,
872.9	what I lost can't compare
872.9	to what the other families lost.
878.06	I know my struggle
878.06	doesn't make theirs any easier.
882.82	I know there are even some who think
882.82	I don't have the right to any pain,
888.22	but only to a life of permanent penance.
893.62	In the end what I know comes down to this:
897.14	the tragic fact is that even
897.14	the most vigilant and responsible of us
903.34	may not be able to help,
906.66	but for love's sake,
908.86	we must never stop trying
911.06	to know the unknowable.
913.38	Thank you.
914.62	(Applause)
