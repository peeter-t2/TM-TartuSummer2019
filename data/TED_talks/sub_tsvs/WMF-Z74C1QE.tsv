15.648	As it turns out, when tens of millions
15.648	of people are unemployed
19.252	or underemployed,
20.81	there's a fair amount of interest
20.81	in what technology might be doing
24	to the labor force.
25.186	And as I look at the conversation,
27.099	it strikes me that it's focused
27.099	on exactly the right topic,
30.803	and at the same time,
30.803	it's missing the point entirely.
33.652	The topic that it's focused on,
35.217	the question is whether or not all these
35.217	digital technologies are affecting
39.724	people's ability to earn a living,
41.765	or, to say it a little bit different way,
43.774	are the droids taking our jobs?
45.887	And there's some evidence that they are.
47.848	The Great Recession ended
47.848	when American GDP resumed
51.917	its kind of slow, steady march upward,
54.808	and some other economic indicators
54.808	also started to rebound,
58.102	and they got kind of healthy
58.102	kind of quickly.
60.419	Corporate profits are quite high;
62.61	in fact, if you include bank profits,
64.53	they're higher than they've ever been.
66.545	And business investment
66.545	in gear -- in equipment
70.056	and hardware and software --
70.056	is at an all-time high.
72.924	So the businesses are getting
72.924	out their checkbooks.
76.263	What they're not really doing is hiring.
78.661	So this red line
79.836	is the employment-to-population ratio,
82.398	in other words, the percentage
82.398	of working-age people in America
86.551	who have work.
87.961	And we see that it cratered
87.961	during the Great Recession,
91.091	and it hasn't started
91.091	to bounce back at all.
94.012	But the story is not
94.012	just a recession story.
96.955	The decade that we've
96.955	just been through had
99.059	relatively anemic job growth
99.059	all throughout,
102.296	especially when we compare it
102.296	to other decades,
104.943	and the 2000s are the only time
104.943	we have on record
107.997	where there were fewer people working
107.997	at the end of the decade
111.553	than at the beginning.
112.979	This is not what you want to see.
114.984	When you graph the number
114.984	of potential employees
118.391	versus the number of jobs in the country,
120.971	you see the gap gets bigger
120.971	and bigger over time,
124.845	and then, during the Great Recession,
124.845	it opened up in a huge way.
128.179	I did some quick calculations.
129.663	I took the last 20 years of GDP growth
132.119	and the last 20 years
132.119	of labor-productivity growth
135.415	and used those in a fairly
135.415	straightforward way
138.157	to try to project how many jobs
138.157	the economy was going to need
141.204	to keep growing,
142.531	and this is the line that I came up with.
144.68	Is that good or bad?
146.446	This is the government's projection
148.381	for the working-age
148.381	population going forward.
151.741	So if these predictions are accurate,
151.741	that gap is not going to close.
156.863	The problem is, I don't think
156.863	these projections are accurate.
159.913	In particular, I think my projection
159.913	is way too optimistic,
163.416	because when I did it,
164.887	I was assuming that the future
164.887	was kind of going to look like the past,
169.129	with labor productivity growth,
170.822	and that's actually not what I believe.
172.717	Because when I look around,
174.09	I think that we ain't seen nothing yet
176.334	when it comes to technology's
176.334	impact on the labor force.
179.962	Just in the past couple years,
179.962	we've seen digital tools
183.957	display skills and abilities
183.957	that they never, ever had before,
188.214	and that kind of eat deeply
188.214	into what we human beings
191.748	do for a living.
193.054	Let me give you a couple examples.
195.004	Throughout all of history,
196.28	if you wanted something translated
196.28	from one language into another,
199.854	you had to involve a human being.
201.93	Now we have multi-language, instantaneous,
205.082	automatic translation services
205.082	available for free
209.526	via many of our devices,
209.526	all the way down to smartphones.
212.693	And if any of us have used these,
214.513	we know that they're not perfect,
214.513	but they're decent.
218.54	Throughout all of history,
218.54	if you wanted something written,
221.536	a report or an article,
221.536	you had to involve a person.
225.418	Not anymore.
226.595	This is an article that appeared
226.595	in Forbes online a while back,
229.592	about Apple's earnings.
230.792	It was written by an algorithm.
232.98	And it's not decent -- it's perfect.
237.009	A lot of people look at this and they say,
239.062	"""OK, but those are very"
239.062	specific, narrow tasks,
241.391	and most knowledge workers
241.391	are actually generalists.
244.326	And what they do is sit on top of a very
244.326	large body of expertise and knowledge
248.542	and they use that to react on the fly
248.542	to kind of unpredictable demands,
252.363	"and that's very, very hard to automate."""
255.063	One of the most impressive
255.063	knowledge workers in recent memory
257.992	is a guy named Ken Jennings.
259.537	He won the quiz show
259.537	"""Jeopardy!"" 74 times in a row."
264.87	Took home three million dollars.
267.084	That's Ken on the right,
267.084	getting beat three-to-one
270.879	by Watson, the Jeopardy-playing
270.879	supercomputer from IBM.
275.902	So when we look at what technology can do
275.902	to general knowledge workers,
279.441	I start to think there might not be
279.441	something so special
282.543	about this idea of a generalist,
284.335	particularly when we start doing things
284.335	like hooking Siri up to Watson,
288.689	and having technologies
288.689	that can understand what we're saying
291.982	and repeat speech back to us.
293.99	Now, Siri is far from perfect,
293.99	and we can make fun of her flaws,
297.917	but we should also keep in mind
299.44	that if technologies like Siri and Watson
299.44	improve along a Moore's law trajectory,
304.828	which they will,
306.374	in six years, they're not going to be two
306.374	times better or four times better,
309.988	they'll be 16 times better
309.988	than they are right now.
313.482	So I start to think a lot of knowledge
313.482	work is going to be affected by this.
317.352	And digital technologies are not
317.352	just impacting knowledge work,
321.112	they're starting to flex their muscles
321.112	in the physical world as well.
324.875	I had the chance a little while back
324.875	to ride in the Google autonomous car,
328.624	which is as cool as it sounds.
330.925	(Laughter)
333.137	And I will vouch that it handled
333.137	the stop-and-go traffic on US 101
337.582	very smoothly.
338.859	There are about three and a half million
338.859	people who drive trucks for a living
342.534	in the United States;
343.709	I think some of them are going
343.709	to be affected by this technology.
346.801	And right now, humanoid robots
346.801	are still incredibly primitive.
349.925	They can't do very much.
351.906	But they're getting better quite quickly
353.902	and DARPA, which is the investment arm
353.902	of the Defense Department,
357.463	is trying to accelerate their trajectory.
359.464	So, in short, yeah, the droids
359.464	are coming for our jobs.
365.105	In the short term, we can
365.105	stimulate job growth
368.021	by encouraging entrepreneurship
370.182	and by investing in infrastructure,
372.12	because the robots today
372.12	still aren't very good at fixing bridges.
375.682	But in the not-too-long-term,
377.604	I think within the lifetimes
377.604	of most of the people in this room,
381.53	we're going to transition into an economy
381.53	that is very productive,
385.102	but that just doesn't need
385.102	a lot of human workers.
388.02	And managing that transition
388.02	is going to be the greatest challenge
391.156	that our society faces.
392.718	Voltaire summarized why; he said,
394.692	"""Work saves us from three great evils:"
394.692	"boredom, vice and need."""
400.43	But despite this challenge --
402.511	personally, I'm still
402.511	a huge digital optimist,
405.447	and I am supremely confident
407.675	that the digital technologies
407.675	that we're developing now
410.287	are going to take us
410.287	into a Utopian future,
412.961	not a dystopian future.
414.697	And to explain why,
415.872	I want to pose a ridiculously
415.872	broad question.
418.475	I want to ask:
419.65	what have been the most important
419.65	developments in human history?
423.02	Now, I want to share some
423.02	of the answers that I've gotten
426.005	in response to this question.
427.426	It's a wonderful question to ask
427.426	and start an endless debate about,
430.618	because some people are going to bring up
432.616	systems of philosophy
432.616	in both the West and the East
435.94	that have changed how a lot
435.94	of people think about the world.
439.187	And then other people will say,
440.704	"""No, actually, the big stories,"
440.704	the big developments
443.189	are the founding
443.189	of the world's major religions,
445.796	which have changed civilizations
445.796	and have changed and influenced
449.046	how countless people
449.046	"are living their lives."""
451.664	And then some other folk will say,
453.385	"""Actually, what changes civilizations,"
455.799	what modifies them and what changes
455.799	people's lives are empires,
460.608	so the great developments in human history
463.037	"are stories of conquest and of war."""
465.823	And then some cheery soul
465.823	usually always pipes up and says,
468.628	"""Hey, don't forget about plagues!"""
470.334	(Laughter)
474.267	There are some optimistic
474.267	answers to this question,
476.814	so some people will bring up
476.814	the Age of Exploration
479.252	and the opening up of the world.
480.821	Others will talk about intellectual
480.821	achievements in disciplines like math
484.623	that have helped us get
484.623	a better handle on the world,
487.141	and other folk will talk about periods
487.141	when there was a deep flourishing
490.605	of the arts and sciences.
492.234	So this debate will go on and on.
493.845	It's an endless debate
495.33	and there's no conclusive,
495.33	single answer to it.
498.587	But if you're a geek like me,
500.128	"you say, ""Well, what do the data say?"""
502.833	And you start to do things
504.189	like graph things
504.189	that we might be interested in --
506.897	the total worldwide
506.897	population, for example,
510	or some measure of social development
512.389	or the state of advancement of a society.
514.901	And you start to plot the data,
514.901	because, by this approach,
519.048	the big stories, the big
519.048	developments in human history,
521.677	are the ones that will bend
521.677	these curves a lot.
524.211	So when you do this
524.211	and when you plot the data,
526.455	you pretty quickly come
526.455	to some weird conclusions.
529.171	You conclude, actually,
530.591	that none of these things
530.591	have mattered very much.
533.178	(Laughter)
537.24	They haven't done
537.24	a darn thing to the curves.
540.617	There has been one story,
540.617	one development in human history
545.331	that bent the curve,
545.331	bent it just about 90 degrees,
548.564	and it is a technology story.
551.223	The steam engine and the other
551.223	associated technologies
554.017	of the Industrial Revolution
556.072	changed the world and influenced
556.072	human history so much,
559.372	that in the words
559.372	of the historian Ian Morris,
561.798	"""... they made mockery out of all"
561.798	"that had come before."""
565.613	And they did this by infinitely
565.613	multiplying the power of our muscles,
569.164	overcoming the limitations of our muscles.
571.582	Now, what we're in the middle of now
574.104	is overcoming the limitations
574.104	of our individual brains
577.161	and infinitely multiplying
577.161	our mental power.
580.096	How can this not be as big a deal
583.297	as overcoming the limitations
583.297	of our muscles?
586.025	So at the risk of repeating
586.025	myself a little bit,
588.909	when I look at what's going on
588.909	with digital technology these days,
592.686	we are not anywhere near
592.686	through with this journey.
595.82	And when I look at what is happening
595.82	to our economies and our societies,
599.35	my single conclusion is that
599.35	we ain't seen nothing yet.
602.463	The best days are really ahead.
604.213	Let me give you a couple examples.
606.238	Economies don't run on energy.
608.635	They don't run on capital,
608.635	they don't run on labor.
611.698	Economies run on ideas.
614.127	So the work of innovation,
614.127	the work of coming up with new ideas,
617.492	is some of the most powerful, most
617.492	fundamental work that we can do
621.214	in an economy.
622.389	And this is kind of how
622.389	we used to do innovation.
625.531	We'd find a bunch of fairly
625.531	similar-looking people ...
628.531	(Laughter)
632.051	We'd take them out of elite institutions,
634.068	we'd put them into other
634.068	elite institutions
636.171	and we'd wait for the innovation.
637.781	Now --
638.974	(Laughter)
641.427	as a white guy who spent
641.427	his whole career at MIT and Harvard,
644.939	I've got no problem with this.
646.989	(Laughter)
650.605	But some other people do,
651.836	and they've kind of crashed the party
653.645	and loosened up
653.645	the dress code of innovation.
655.814	(Laughter)
656.87	So here are the winners of a Topcoder
656.87	programming challenge,
660.094	and I assure you that nobody cares
662.81	where these kids grew up,
662.81	where they went to school,
666.59	or what they look like.
668.114	All anyone cares about is the quality
668.114	of the work, the quality of the ideas.
671.981	And over and over again,
671.981	we see this happening
674.241	in the technology-facilitated world.
676.789	The work of innovation
676.789	is becoming more open,
679.31	more inclusive, more transparent
679.31	and more merit-based,
682.983	and that's going to continue no matter
682.983	what MIT and Harvard think of it,
686.705	and I couldn't be happier
686.705	about that development.
689.609	I hear once in a while,
689.609	"""OK, I'll grant you that,"
692.088	but technology is still a tool
692.088	for the rich world,
695.131	and what's not happening,
696.554	these digital tools are not
696.554	improving the lives
699.189	"of people at the bottom of the pyramid."""
701.362	And I want to say to that
701.362	very clearly: nonsense.
704.052	The bottom of the pyramid is benefiting
704.052	hugely from technology.
707.569	The economist Robert Jensen
707.569	did this wonderful study a while back
711.153	where he watched, in great detail,
713.11	what happened to the fishing
713.11	villages of Kerala, India,
716.752	when they got mobile phones
716.752	for the very first time.
719.657	And when you write for the Quarterly
719.657	Journal of Economics,
722.49	you have to use very dry
722.49	and very circumspect language.
725.396	But when I read his paper,
726.682	I kind of feel Jensen
726.682	is trying to scream at us
728.913	"and say, ""Look, this was a big deal."
731.261	Prices stabilized, so people
731.261	could plan their economic lives.
734.936	Waste was not reduced --
734.936	it was eliminated.
739.007	And the lives of both
739.007	the buyers and the sellers
741.272	"in these villages measurably improved."""
744.073	Now, what I don't think
744.073	is that Jensen got extremely lucky
747.887	and happened to land
747.887	in the one set of villages
750.122	where technology made things better.
752.455	What happened instead
752.455	is he very carefully documented
755.126	what happens over and over again
755.126	when technology comes for the first time
759.229	to an environment and a community:
761.19	the lives of people, the welfares
761.19	of people, improve dramatically.
765.051	So as I look around at all the evidence
766.956	and I think about the room
766.956	that we have ahead of us,
769.417	I become a huge digital optimist
771.269	and I start to think that this wonderful
771.269	statement from the physicist Freeman Dyson
775.869	is actually not hyperbole.
777.631	This is an accurate assessment
777.631	of what's going on.
780.164	Our technologies are great gifts,
782.886	and we, right now,
782.886	have the great good fortune
785.957	to be living at a time when
785.957	digital technology is flourishing,
789.711	when it is broadening and deepening
789.711	and becoming more profound
793.13	all around the world.
794.432	So, yeah, the droids are taking our jobs,
797.731	but focusing on that fact
797.731	misses the point entirely.
801.326	The point is that then we
801.326	are freed up to do other things,
804.85	and what we're going to do,
804.85	I am very confident,
807.161	what we're going to do is reduce poverty
809.701	and drudgery and misery around the world.
812.194	I'm very confident we're going to learn
812.194	to live more lightly on the planet,
816.223	and I am extremely confident
816.223	that what we're going to do
819.672	with our new digital tools
821.071	is going to be so profound
821.071	and so beneficial
824.087	that it's going to make a mockery
824.087	out of everything that came before.
827.595	I'm going to leave the last word
829.175	to a guy who had a front-row seat
829.175	for digital progress,
831.853	our old friend Ken Jennings.
833.449	I'm with him; I'm going to echo his words:
835.716	"""I, for one, welcome our new"
835.716	"computer overlords."""
838.656	(Laughter)
839.761	Thanks very much.
841.269	(Applause)
