12.703	Let's face it:
14.617	Driving is dangerous.
17.062	It's one of the things that we don't like to think about,
20.16	but the fact that religious icons and good luck charms
23.812	show up on dashboards around the world
28.602	betrays the fact that we know this to be true.
32.739	Car accidents are the leading cause of death
36.333	in people ages 16 to 19 in the United States --
40.503	leading cause of death --
43.346	and 75 percent of these accidents have nothing to do
47.209	with drugs or alcohol.
49.494	So what happens?
51.755	No one can say for sure, but I remember my first accident.
55.974	I was a young driver out on the highway,
59.777	and the car in front of me, I saw the brake lights go on.
62.035	"I'm like, ""Okay, all right, this guy is slowing down,"
63.835	"I'll slow down too."""
65.117	I step on the brake.
67.043	But no, this guy isn't slowing down.
69.297	This guy is stopping, dead stop, dead stop on the highway.
72.475	It was just going 65 -- to zero?
75.015	I slammed on the brakes.
76.535	I felt the ABS kick in, and the car is still going,
79.594	and it's not going to stop, and I know it's not going to stop,
82.29	and the air bag deploys, the car is totaled,
85.229	and fortunately, no one was hurt.
88.786	But I had no idea that car was stopping,
92.997	and I think we can do a lot better than that.
96.642	I think we can transform the driving experience
100.787	by letting our cars talk to each other.
104.666	I just want you to think a little bit
106.09	about what the experience of driving is like now.
108.978	Get into your car. Close the door. You're in a glass bubble.
113.006	You can't really directly sense the world around you.
115.922	You're in this extended body.
118.103	You're tasked with navigating it down
120.266	partially-seen roadways,
122.322	in and amongst other metal giants, at super-human speeds.
126.746	Okay? And all you have to guide you are your two eyes.
131.226	Okay, so that's all you have,
132.988	eyes that weren't really designed for this task,
134.723	but then people ask you to do things like,
138.474	you want to make a lane change,
140.023	what's the first thing they ask you do?
142.344	Take your eyes off the road. That's right.
145.439	Stop looking where you're going, turn,
147.535	check your blind spot,
149.553	and drive down the road without looking where you're going.
153.024	You and everyone else. This is the safe way to drive.
156.159	Why do we do this? Because we have to,
158.4	we have to make a choice, do I look here or do I look here?
160.979	What's more important?
162.5	And usually we do a fantastic job
165.211	picking and choosing what we attend to on the road.
168.98	But occasionally we miss something.
172.63	Occasionally we sense something wrong or too late.
177.091	In countless accidents, the driver says,
179.079	"""I didn't see it coming."""
181.387	And I believe that. I believe that.
184.668	We can only watch so much.
187.593	But the technology exists now that can help us improve that.
192.737	In the future, with cars exchanging data with each other,
197.033	we will be able to see not just three cars ahead
200.961	and three cars behind, to the right and left,
202.555	all at the same time, bird's eye view,
205.721	we will actually be able to see into those cars.
208.849	We will be able to see the velocity of the car in front of us,
211.22	to see how fast that guy's going or stopping.
214.46	If that guy's going down to zero, I'll know.
218.97	And with computation and algorithms and predictive models,
222.829	we will be able to see the future.
226.102	You may think that's impossible.
227.658	How can you predict the future? That's really hard.
230.389	Actually, no. With cars, it's not impossible.
234.008	Cars are three-dimensional objects
236.74	that have a fixed position and velocity.
239.072	They travel down roads.
240.703	Often they travel on pre-published routes.
243.115	It's really not that hard to make reasonable predictions
247.053	about where a car's going to be in the near future.
249.917	Even if, when you're in your car
251.919	and some motorcyclist comes -- bshoom! --
256.209	I know you've had this experience --
258.756	"that guy didn't ""just come out of nowhere."""
261.359	That guy's been on the road probably for the last half hour.
265.002	(Laughter)
266.192	Right? I mean, somebody's seen him.
269.781	Ten, 20, 30 miles back, someone's seen that guy,
272.549	and as soon as one car sees that guy
274.933	and puts him on the map, he's on the map --
277.164	position, velocity,
279.34	good estimate he'll continue going 85 miles an hour.
281.661	You'll know, because your car will know, because
283.845	that other car will have whispered something in his ear,
286.12	"like, ""By the way, five minutes,"
288.043	"motorcyclist, watch out."""
290.818	You can make reasonable predictions about how cars behave.
293.521	I mean, they're Newtonian objects.
294.886	That's very nice about them.
297.795	So how do we get there?
300.829	We can start with something as simple
303.095	as sharing our position data between cars,
305.965	just sharing GPS.
307.857	If I have a GPS and a camera in my car,
310.301	I have a pretty precise idea of where I am
312.532	and how fast I'm going.
314.264	With computer vision, I can estimate where
315.921	the cars around me are, sort of, and where they're going.
319.458	And same with the other cars.
320.428	They can have a precise idea of where they are,
322.242	and sort of a vague idea of where the other cars are.
324.388	What happens if two cars share that data,
327.619	if they talk to each other?
329.574	I can tell you exactly what happens.
332.352	Both models improve.
334.691	Everybody wins.
336.746	Professor Bob Wang and his team
339.323	have done computer simulations of what happens
342.061	when fuzzy estimates combine, even in light traffic,
345.492	when cars just share GPS data,
348.116	and we've moved this research out of the computer simulation
350.629	and into robot test beds that have the actual sensors
353.656	that are in cars now on these robots:
356.789	stereo cameras, GPS,
358.627	and the two-dimensional laser range finders
360.501	that are common in backup systems.
362.741	We also attach a discrete short-range communication radio,
367.225	and the robots talk to each other.
369.134	When these robots come at each other,
370.673	they track each other's position precisely,
373.644	and they can avoid each other.
376.381	We're now adding more and more robots into the mix,
379.607	and we encountered some problems.
381.078	One of the problems, when you get too much chatter,
383.437	it's hard to process all the packets, so you have to prioritize,
387.165	and that's where the predictive model helps you.
389.522	If your robot cars are all tracking the predicted trajectories,
393.894	you don't pay as much attention to those packets.
395.661	You prioritize the one guy
397.364	who seems to be going a little off course.
398.697	That guy could be a problem.
401.223	And you can predict the new trajectory.
404.225	So you don't only know that he's going off course, you know how.
406.988	And you know which drivers you need to alert to get out of the way.
410.713	And we wanted to do -- how can we best alert everyone?
413.346	"How can these cars whisper, ""You need to get out of the way?"""
416.529	Well, it depends on two things:
418.046	one, the ability of the car,
420.215	and second the ability of the driver.
423.432	If one guy has a really great car,
424.937	but they're on their phone or, you know, doing something,
427.862	they're not probably in the best position
429.792	to react in an emergency.
432.762	So we started a separate line of research
434.427	doing driver state modeling.
436.978	And now, using a series of three cameras,
439.307	we can detect if a driver is looking forward,
441.577	looking away, looking down, on the phone,
444.437	or having a cup of coffee.
447.498	We can predict the accident
449.568	and we can predict who, which cars,
453.219	are in the best position to move out of the way
456.705	to calculate the safest route for everyone.
459.714	Fundamentally, these technologies exist today.
464.349	I think the biggest problem that we face
467.173	is our own willingness to share our data.
470.186	I think it's a very disconcerting notion,
472.817	this idea that our cars will be watching us,
475.203	talking about us to other cars,
478.574	that we'll be going down the road in a sea of gossip.
482.001	But I believe it can be done in a way that protects our privacy,
485.898	just like right now, when I look at your car from the outside,
489.639	I don't really know about you.
492.002	If I look at your license plate number,
493.139	I don't really know who you are.
495.025	I believe our cars can talk about us behind our backs.
499.274	(Laughter)
502.249	And I think it's going to be a great thing.
505.434	I want you to consider for a moment
507.084	if you really don't want the distracted teenager behind you
511.202	to know that you're braking,
513.322	that you're coming to a dead stop.
516.246	By sharing our data willingly,
518.987	we can do what's best for everyone.
521.799	So let your car gossip about you.
524.875	It's going to make the roads a lot safer.
527.913	Thank you.
529.704	(Applause)
