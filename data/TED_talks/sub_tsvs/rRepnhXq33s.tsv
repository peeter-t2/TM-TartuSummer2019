16.307	Over the next five minutes,
17.65	my intention is to transform
17.65	your relationship with sound.
21.323	Let me start with the observation
22.922	that most of the sound
22.922	around us is accidental;
25.164	much of it is unpleasant. (Traffic noise)
27.302	We stand on street corners,
27.302	shouting over noise like this,
30.089	pretending it doesn't exist.
31.489	This habit of suppressing sound has meant
33.49	that our relationship with sound
33.49	has become largely unconscious.
36.862	There are four major ways
36.862	sound is affecting you all the time,
39.863	and I'd like to raise them
39.863	in your consciousness today.
42.482	The first is physiological.
44.127	(Alarm clocks ring)
47.021	Sorry about that.
48.201	I just gave you a shot of cortisol,
48.201	your fight-flight hormone.
51.148	Sounds are affecting
51.148	your hormone secretions all the time,
53.926	but also your breathing, heart rate --
53.926	which I just also did --
57.19	and your brainwaves.
58.639	It's not just unpleasant sounds
58.639	like that that do it.
61.166	This is surf. (Ocean waves)
62.499	It has the frequency of roughly
65.016	Most people find that very soothing,
66.789	and, interestingly, 12 cycles per minute
66.789	is roughly the frequency
69.909	of the breathing of a sleeping human,
71.712	so there is a deep resonance
71.712	with being at rest.
74.053	We also associate it
74.053	with being stress-free and on holiday.
77.382	The second way in which sound
77.382	affects you is psychological.
80.749	Music is the most powerful form
80.749	of sound that we know
83.258	that affects our emotional state.
83.258	(Albinoni's Adagio)
85.791	This is guaranteed to make most of you
85.791	feel pretty sad if I leave it on.
89.26	Music is not the only kind of sound,
89.26	however, which affects your emotions.
92.761	Natural sound can do that, too.
94.619	Birdsong, for example, is a sound
94.619	which most people find reassuring.
98.26	There's a reason:
98.26	over hundreds of thousands of years
100.795	we've learned that when the birds
100.795	are singing, things are safe.
103.788	It's when they stop
103.788	you need to be worried.
105.817	The third way in which
105.817	sound affects you is cognitively.
108.469	You can't understand two people
108.469	talking at once (Voice-over)
111.33	or in this case, one person talking twice.
113.399	You have to choose which me
113.399	you're going to listen to.
115.977	We have a very small amount of bandwidth
115.977	for processing auditory input,
119.365	which is why noise like this ...
120.949	(Office noise)
121.988	is extremely damaging for productivity.
123.898	If you have to work
123.898	in an open-plan office like this,
126.431	your productivity is greatly reduced.
128.26	And whatever number you're thinking of,
128.26	it probably isn't as bad as this.
131.761	[Open-plan offices productivity down 66%]
135.334	You are one-third as productive
135.334	in open-plan offices as in quiet rooms.
138.975	I have a tip for you:
140.15	if you work in spaces like that,
140.15	carry headphones with you,
142.959	with a soothing sound like birdsong.
144.721	Put them on, and your productivity
144.721	goes back up to triple what it would be.
148.329	The fourth way in which
148.329	sound affects us is behaviorally.
151.583	With all that other stuff going on,
153.292	it would be amazing
153.292	if our behavior didn't change.
155.679	(Techno music)
156.712	So ask yourself: Is this person
156.712	ever going to drive
159.155	at a steady 28 miles per hour?
160.653	I don't think so.
161.828	At the simplest, you move
161.828	away from unpleasant sound
164.761	and towards pleasant sounds.
166.22	So if I were to play this ...
167.681	(Jackhammer)
168.922	for more than a few seconds,
168.922	you'd feel uncomfortable;
171.518	for more than a few minutes,
171.518	you'd be leaving the room in droves.
174.607	For people who can't get away
174.607	from noise like that,
177.035	it's extremely damaging for their health.
179.036	And that's not the only thing
179.036	that bad sound damages.
181.569	Most retail sound is inappropriate
181.569	and accidental, even hostile,
184.888	and it has a dramatic effect on sales.
187.012	For you retailers, you may want
187.012	to look away before I show this slide.
190.424	[Inappropriate retail soundscapes
190.424	sales down 28%]
192.78	They're losing up to 30 percent
192.78	of their business
195.209	with people leaving shops faster,
195.209	or just turning around at the door.
198.491	We've all done it, left the area,
200.108	because the sound in there is so dreadful.
202.142	I want to spend just a moment
202.142	talking about the model we've developed,
205.509	which allows us to start at the top
205.509	and look at the drivers of sound,
208.797	analyze the soundscape
209.988	and then predict the four outcomes
209.988	I just talked about.
212.629	Or start at the bottom
212.629	and say what outcomes we want,
215.523	and then design a soundscape
215.523	to have a desired effect.
218.112	At last we've got
218.112	some science we can apply.
220.237	And we're in the business
220.237	of designing soundscapes.
222.672	Just a word on music.
223.973	Music is the most powerful sound there is,
223.973	often inappropriately deployed.
227.644	It's powerful for two reasons:
229.153	you recognize it fast,
229.153	and you associate it very powerfully.
232.26	I'll give you two examples.
233.878	"(First chord of ""A Hard Day's Night"")"
235.772	Most of you recognize that immediately.
237.702	The younger, maybe not.
238.877	(Laughter)
240.109	"(First notes of ""Jaws"" theme)"
241.529	Most of you associate that with something!
243.636	Now, those are one-second
243.636	samples of music.
245.785	Music is very powerful,
246.961	and unfortunately, it's veneering
246.961	commercial spaces, often inappropriately.
250.847	I hope that's going to change
250.847	over the next few years.
253.777	Let me talk about brands for a moment,
253.777	since some of you run brands.
256.997	Every brand is out there
256.997	making sound right now.
259.285	There are eight expressions of a brand
259.285	in sound; they're all important.
262.666	And every brand needs to have
262.666	guidelines at the center.
265.31	I'm glad to say
265.31	that is starting to happen now.
267.593	(Intel ad jingle)
269.195	You all recognize that one.
270.784	(Nokia ringtone)
271.815	This is the most-played tune
271.815	in the world today --
274.331	1.8 billion times a day,
274.331	that tune is played.
276.563	(Laughter)
277.643	And it cost Nokia absolutely nothing.
280.025	I'll leave you with four golden rules,
280.025	for those of you who run businesses,
283.601	for commercial sound.
284.781	First, make it congruent,
286.26	pointing in the same direction
286.26	as your visual communication.
289.411	That increases impact
289.411	by over 1,100 percent.
292.069	If your sound is pointing
292.069	the opposite direction, incongruent,
295.26	you reduce impact by 86 percent.
297.26	That's an order of magnitude, up or down.
299.97	This is important.
301.478	Secondly, make it appropriate
301.478	to the situation.
304.26	Thirdly, make it valuable.
305.541	Give people something with the sound,
305.541	don't just bombard them with stuff.
309.033	Finally, test and test it again.
310.616	Sound is complex; there are many
310.616	countervailing influences.
313.424	It can be a bit like a bowl of spaghetti:
315.425	sometimes you just have to eat it
315.425	and see what happens.
318.081	So I hope this talk has raised sound
318.081	in your consciousness.
320.894	If you're listening consciously,
322.479	you can take control
322.479	of the sound around you.
324.615	It's good for your health
324.615	and for your productivity.
327.263	If we all do that, we move to a state
329.08	that I like to think will be
329.08	sound living in the world.
331.689	I'll leave you with more birdsong.
331.689	(Birds chirping)
334.11	I recommend at least five minutes
334.11	a day, but there's no maximum dose.
337.419	Thank you for lending me your ears today.
339.475	(Applause)
