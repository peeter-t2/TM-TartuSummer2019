25	I'm Michael Shermer,
25	director of the Skeptics Society,
27.556	"publisher of ""Skeptic"" magazine."
29.112	We investigate claims of the paranormal,
31.049	pseudo-science, fringe groups and cults,
31.049	and claims of all kinds between,
34.755	science and pseudo-science
34.755	and non-science and junk science,
37.673	voodoo science, pathological science,
37.673	bad science, non-science,
41	and plain old non-sense.
42.911	And unless you've been on Mars recently,
44.852	you know there's a lot of that out there.
46.894	Some people call us debunkers,
46.894	which is kind of a negative term.
49.94	But let's face it, there's a lot of bunk.
52.072	We are like the bunko squads
52.072	of the police departments out there --
55.549	well, we're sort of like
55.549	the Ralph Naders of bad ideas,
59	(Laughter)
60.254	trying to replace bad ideas
60.254	with good ideas.
63	I'll show you an example of a bad idea.
64.887	I brought this with me,
66.069	this was given to us
66.069	by NBC Dateline to test.
70	It's produced by the Quadro
70	Corporation of West Virginia.
73.31	It's called the Quadro 2000 Dowser Rod.
76.244	(Laughter)
77.714	This was being sold to high-school
77.714	administrators for $900 apiece.
83	It's a piece of plastic with a Radio
83	Shack antenna attached to it.
87.351	You could dowse for all sorts of things,
89.341	but this particular one was built
89.341	to dowse for marijuana
92.758	in students' lockers.
94	(Laughter)
96.484	So the way it works
96.484	is you go down the hallway,
100.053	and you see if it tilts
100.053	toward a particular locker,
103.076	and then you open the locker.
104.544	So it looks something like this.
106.145	I'll show you.
108.809	(Laughter)
110	Well, it has kind of a right-leaning bias.
113.415	Well, this is science,
113.415	so we'll do a controlled experiment.
116.244	It'll go this way for sure.
117.85	(Laughter)
121.808	Sir, do you want to empty
121.808	your pockets, please, sir?
124.358	(Laughter)
126.22	So the question was, can it actually
126.22	find marijuana in students' lockers?
129.701	And the answer is,
129.701	if you open enough of them, yes.
132.323	(Laughter)
133.37	(Applause)
135	But in science, we have to keep track
135	of the misses, not just the hits.
138.405	And that's probably the key lesson
138.405	to my short talk here:
141.695	This is how psychics work, astrologers,
141.695	tarot card readers and so on.
145.453	People remember the hits
145.453	and forget the misses.
147.696	In science, we keep the whole database,
149.615	and look to see if the number
149.615	of hits somehow stands out
152.3	from the total number
152.3	you'd expect by chance.
154.537	In this case, we tested it.
155.855	We had two opaque boxes:
157.371	one with government-approved THC
157.371	marijuana, and one with nothing.
161.029	And it got it 50 percent of the time --
162.934	(Laughter)
164.051	which is exactly what you'd expect
164.051	with a coin-flip model.
167	So that's just a fun little example
167	here of the sorts of things we do.
171.015	"""Skeptic"" is the quarterly publication."
171.015	Each one has a particular theme.
174.507	This one is on the future of intelligence.
176.605	Are people getting smarter or dumber?
178.4	I have an opinion of this myself
178.4	because of the business I'm in,
181.472	but in fact, people, it turns out,
181.472	are getting smarter.
184.163	Three IQ points per 10 years, going up.
187	Sort of an interesting thing.
188.675	With science, don't think of skepticism
188.675	as a thing, or science as a thing.
192.246	Are science and religion compatible?
194	It's like, are science
194	and plumbing compatible?
196.255	They're just two different things.
197.913	Science is not a thing. It's a verb.
199.676	It's a way of thinking about things.
201.422	It's a way of looking for natural
201.422	explanations for all phenomena.
204.516	I mean, what's more likely:
205.89	that extraterrestrial intelligences
205.89	or multi-dimensional beings
209.477	travel across vast distances
209.477	of interstellar space
211.891	to leave a crop circle in Farmer Bob's
211.891	field in Puckerbrush, Kansas
215.095	to promote skeptic.com, our web page?
216.929	Or is it more likely that a reader
216.929	"of ""Skeptic"" did this with Photoshop?"
221.431	And in all cases we have to ask --
223.105	(Laughter)
224.953	What's the more likely explanation?
227	Before we say something
227	is out of this world,
229.191	we should first make sure
229.191	that it's not in this world.
231.879	What's more likely:
233.054	that Arnold had extraterrestrial help
233.054	in his run for the governorship,
236.404	"or that the ""World Weekly News"""
236.404	makes stuff up?
238.926	(Laughter)
240.339	The same theme is expressed nicely
240.339	here in this Sidney Harris cartoon.
245.025	For those of you in the back,
245.025	"it says here: ""Then a miracle occurs."
248.264	I think you need to be more
248.264	"explicit here in step two."""
251	This single slide completely dismantles
251	the intelligent design arguments.
255.52	There's nothing more to it than that.
257.392	(Applause)
258.466	You can say a miracle occurs,
259.878	it's just that it doesn't explain
259.878	anything or offer anything.
262.868	There's nothing to test.
264.042	It's the end of the conversation
264.042	for intelligent design creationists.
267.514	And it's true, scientists sometimes throw
267.514	terms out as linguistic place fillers --
272.424	dark energy or dark matter,
272.424	something like that --
274.796	until we figure out what it is,
274.796	we'll call it this.
277.28	It's the beginning of the causal
277.28	chain for science.
280.005	For intelligent design creationists,
280.005	it's the end of the chain.
284.104	So again, we can ask this:
284.104	what's more likely?
286.3	Are UFOs alien spaceships, or perceptual
286.3	cognitive mistakes, or even fakes?
290.715	This is a UFO shot from my house
290.715	in Altadena, California,
294	looking down over Pasadena.
296	And if it looks a lot like a Buick
296	hubcap, it's because it is.
299.545	You don't even need Photoshop
299.545	or high-tech equipment,
302.307	you don't need computers.
303.529	This was shot with a throwaway
303.529	Kodak Instamatic camera.
307	You just have somebody off on the side
307	with a hubcap ready to go.
310.12	Camera's ready -- that's it.
312.042	(Laughter)
313.503	So, although it's possible
313.503	that most of these things are fake
317	or illusions or so on,
317	and that some of them are real,
320.738	it's more likely that all of them
320.738	are fake, like the crop circles.
323.895	On a more serious note, in all of science
323.895	we're looking for a balance
327.3	between data and theory.
329	In the case of Galileo,
329	he had two problems
333	when he turned his telescope to Saturn.
335.385	First of all, there was no
335.385	theory of planetary rings.
338.531	Second of all, his data
338.531	was grainy and fuzzy,
340.748	and he couldn't quite make out
340.748	what he was looking at.
343.3	So he wrote that he had seen --
345	"""I have observed that the furthest"
345	"planet has three bodies."""
348.531	And this is what he ended up
348.531	concluding that he saw.
351.42	So without a theory of planetary
351.42	rings and with only grainy data,
355	you can't have a good theory.
356.942	It wasn't solved until 1655.
358.585	This is Christiaan Huygens's book
358.585	that catalogs all the mistakes
361.623	people made trying to figure out
361.623	what was going on with Saturn.
364.609	It wasn't till Huygens had two things:
366.489	He had a good theory of planetary rings
366.489	and how the solar system operated,
370.999	and he had better telescopic,
370.999	more fine-grain data
373.886	in which he could figure out that
373.886	as the Earth is going around faster --
377.453	according to Kepler's Laws --
377.453	than Saturn, then we catch up with it.
380.705	And we see the angles of the rings
380.705	at different angles, there.
384	And that, in fact, turns out to be true.
386.244	The problem with having a theory is that
386.244	it may be loaded with cognitive biases.
391.565	So one of the problems of explaining
391.565	why people believe weird things
394.856	is that we have things, on a simple level,
396.948	and then I'll go to more serious ones.
398.8	Like, we have a tendency to see faces.
400.7	This is the face on Mars.
402.5	In 1976, where there was a whole movement
402.5	to get NASA to photograph that area
407.036	because people thought this was monumental
407.036	architecture made by Martians.
410.976	Here's the close-up of it from 2001.
413.771	If you squint, you can still see the face.
416.255	And when you're squinting,
417.581	you're turning that from fine-grain
417.581	to coarse-grain,
420.628	so you're reducing
420.628	the quality of your data.
422.939	And if I didn't tell you what to look for,
422.939	you'd still see the face,
426.192	because we're programmed
426.192	by evolution to see faces.
428.645	Faces are important for us socially.
430.82	And of course, happy faces,
430.82	faces of all kinds are easy to see.
434.312	You see the happy face on Mars, there.
436.232	(Laughter)
437.407	If astronomers were frogs,
437.407	perhaps they'd see Kermit the Frog.
440.344	Do you see him there? Little froggy legs.
442.688	Or if geologists were elephants?
445.736	Religious iconography.
449	(Laughter)
451.825	Discovered by a Tennessee baker in 1996.
454	He charged five bucks a head
454	to come see the nun bun
456.501	till he got a cease-and-desist
456.501	from Mother Teresa's lawyer.
460.238	Here's Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our
460.238	Lady of Watsonville, just down the street,
464	or is it up the street from here?
465.628	Tree bark is particularly good
465.628	because it's nice and grainy, branchy,
469	black-and-white splotchy and you can
469	get the pattern-seeking --
472.024	humans are pattern-seeking animals.
474	Here's the Virgin Mary on the side
474	of a glass window in Sao Paulo.
477.587	Here's when the Virgin Mary made
477.587	her appearance on a cheese sandwich --
481.025	which I got to actually
481.025	hold in a Las Vegas casino --
483.539	of course, this being America.
485.1	(Laughter)
486.649	This casino paid $28,500
486.649	on eBay for the cheese sandwich.
491	(Laughter)
493	But who does it really look like?
493	The Virgin Mary?
495.405	(Laughter)
497.408	It has that sort of
497.408	puckered lips, 1940s-era look.
501.297	Virgin Mary in Clearwater, Florida.
503	I actually went to see this one.
505	There was a lot of people there.
506.858	The faithful come in their wheelchairs
506.858	and crutches, and so on.
511.534	We went down and investigated.
513.419	Just to give you a size, that's Dawkins,
513.419	me and The Amazing Randi,
516.616	next to this two,
516.616	two and a half story-sized image.
519.053	All these candles, thousands of candles
519.053	people had lit in tribute to this.
522.579	So we walked around the backside,
522.579	to see what was going on.
525.408	It turns out wherever there's
525.408	a sprinkler head and a palm tree,
528.763	you get the effect.
530	Here's the Virgin Mary on the backside,
530	which they started to wipe off.
533.405	I guess you can only have
533.405	one miracle per building.
536	(Laughter)
539.357	So is it really a miracle of Mary,
539.357	or is it a miracle of Marge?
543.06	(Laughter)
544.085	And now I'm going to finish up
544.085	with another example of this,
547.712	with auditory illusions.
550.513	"There's this film, ""White Noise,"""
550.513	with Michael Keaton,
553.063	about the dead talking back to us.
555.621	By the way, the whole business of talking
555.621	to the dead is not that big a deal.
559.31	Anybody can do it, turns out.
560.819	It's getting the dead to talk
560.819	back that's the really hard part.
563.931	(Laughter)
565.053	In this case, supposedly, these messages
565.053	are hidden in electronic phenomena.
568.859	There's a ReverseSpeech.com web page
568.859	where I downloaded this stuff.
572.168	This is the most famous one
572.168	of all of these.
575.343	Here's the forward version
575.343	of the very famous song.
578.168	(Music with lyrics)
579.263	If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
579.263	don't be alarmed now.
585.089	It's just a spring clean
585.089	for the May Queen.
590.764	Yes, there are two paths you
590.764	can go by, but in the long run,
596.87	There's still time to change
596.87	the road you're on.
601.514	(Music ends)
603.733	Couldn't you just listen to that all day?
606.368	All right, here it is backwards,
607.999	and see if you can hear the hidden
607.999	messages that are supposedly in there.
612.513	(Music with unintelligible lyrics)
626.45	(Lyrics) Satan!
627.768	(Unintelligible lyrics continue)
641.934	What did you get?
641.934	Audience: Satan!
643.578	"Satan. OK, at least we got ""Satan""."
645.314	Now, I'll prime the auditory
645.314	part of your brain
647.64	to tell you what you're supposed
647.64	to hear, and then hear it again.
651.101	(Music with lyrics)
677.673	(Music ends)
678.783	(Laughter)
680.014	(Applause)
686.427	You can't miss it
686.427	when I tell you what's there.
689	(Laughter)
692.274	I'm going to just end
692.274	with a positive, nice little story.
696.333	The Skeptics is a nonprofit
696.333	educational organization.
699.202	We're always looking for little
699.202	good things that people do.
702.046	And in England, there's a pop singer.
704.079	One of the top popular singers
704.079	in England today, Katie Melua.
707.848	And she wrote a beautiful song.
709.4	It was in the top five in 2005, called,
709.4	"""Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing."""
715	It's a love story -- she's sort
715	of the Norah Jones of the UK --
718.12	about how she much loves her guy,
719.765	and compared to nine million
719.765	bicycles, and so forth.
722.265	And she has this one passage here.
724.514	(Music)
725.574	(Lyrics) We are 12 billion
725.574	light-years from the edge
731.369	That's a guess,
733.718	No one can ever say it's true,
737.453	But I know that I will always be with you.
742.731	Michael Shermer: Well, that's nice.
742.731	At least she got it close.
745.72	In America it'd be,
745.72	"""We're 6,000 light years from the edge."""
748.667	(Laughter)
749.727	But my friend, Simon Singh, the particle
749.727	physicist now turned science educator,
753.52	who wrote the book
753.52	"""The Big Bang,"" and so on,"
755.671	uses every chance he gets
755.671	to promote good science.
758.1	And so he wrote an op-ed piece
758.1	"in ""The Guardian"" about Katie's song,"
761.41	in which he said, well, we know exactly
761.41	how far from the edge.
766.47	You know, it's 13.7 billion light years,
766.47	and it's not a guess.
770.312	We know within precise
770.312	error bars how close it is.
774.6	So we can say, although not absolutely
774.6	true, it's pretty close to being true.
778.434	And, to his credit, Katie called him up
778.434	after this op-ed piece came out, and said,
783.197	"""I'm so embarrassed."
783.197	I was in the astronomy club.
785.592	"I should've known better."""
786.894	And she re-cut the song.
788.14	So I will end with the new version.
790.012	(Music with lyrics)
791.3	We are 13.7 billion light years
793.745	from the edge of the observable universe.
797.26	That's a good estimate
797.26	with well-defined error bars.
801.053	And with the available information,
804.229	I predict that I will always be with you.
808.596	(Laughter)
809.777	How cool is that?
810.969	(Applause)
