15.26	The recent debate over copyright laws
17.26	like SOPA in the United States
19.26	and the ACTA agreement in Europe
21.26	has been very emotional.
23.26	And I think some dispassionate, quantitative reasoning
26.26	could really bring a great deal to the debate.
28.26	I'd therefore like to propose
30.26	that we employ, we enlist,
32.26	the cutting edge field of copyright math
34.26	whenever we approach this subject.
36.26	For instance, just recently
38.26	the Motion Picture Association revealed
40.26	that our economy loses 58 billion dollars a year
43.26	to copyright theft.
46.26	Now rather than just argue about this number,
48.26	a copyright mathematician will analyze it
51.26	and he'll soon discover that this money
53.26	could stretch from this auditorium
55.26	all the way across Ocean Boulevard
57.26	to the Westin, and then to Mars ...
60.26	(Laughter)
62.26	... if we use pennies.
65.26	Now this is obviously a powerful,
67.26	some might say dangerously powerful, insight.
70.26	But it's also a morally important one.
72.26	Because this isn't just the hypothetical retail value
75.26	of some pirated movies that we're talking about,
77.26	but this is actual economic losses.
79.26	This is the equivalent
81.26	to the entire American corn crop failing
83.26	along with all of our fruit crops,
86.26	as well as wheat, tobacco,
88.26	rice, sorghum --
90.26	whatever sorghum is -- losing sorghum.
94.26	But identifying the actual losses to the economy
97.26	is almost impossible to do
99.26	unless we use copyright math.
101.26	Now music revenues are down by about eight billion dollars a year
104.26	since Napster first came on the scene.
106.26	So that's a chunk of what we're looking for.
109.26	But total movie revenues
111.26	across theaters, home video and pay-per-view are up.
113.26	And TV, satellite and cable revenues are way up.
116.26	Other content markets like book publishing and radio
118.26	are also up.
120.26	So this small missing chunk here
122.26	is puzzling.
124.26	(Laughter)
127.26	(Applause)
130.26	Since the big content markets
132.26	have grown in line with historic norms,
134.26	it's not additional growth that piracy has prevented,
137.26	but copyright math tells us
139.26	it must therefore be foregone growth
142.26	in a market that has no historic norms --
144.26	one that didn't exist in the 90's.
146.26	What we're looking at here
148.26	is the insidious cost of ringtone piracy.
150.26	(Laughter)
156.26	which is enough, at 30 seconds a ringtone,
158.26	that could stretch from here
160.26	to Neanderthal times.
162.26	(Laughter)
166.26	It's true.
168.26	(Applause)
170.26	I have Excel.
172.26	(Laughter)
174.26	The movie folks also tell us
176.26	that our economy loses
178.26	over 370,000 jobs to content theft,
181.26	which is quite a lot when you consider that, back in '98,
184.26	the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated
186.26	that the motion picture and video industries
188.26	were employing 270,000 people.
191.26	Other data has the music industry at about 45,000 people.
194.26	And so the job losses that came with the Internet
196.26	and all that content theft,
198.26	have therefore left us with negative employment in our content industries.
201.26	And this is just one of the many mind-blowing statistics
204.26	that copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day.
206.26	And some people think that string theory is tough.
209.26	(Laughter)
211.26	Now this is a key number from the copyright mathematicians' toolkit.
214.26	It's the precise amount of harm
216.26	that comes to media companies
218.26	whenever a single copyrighted song or movie
220.26	gets pirated.
222.26	Hollywood and Congress derived this number mathematically
225.26	back when they last sat down to improve copyright damages
228.26	and made this law.
230.26	Some people think this number's a little bit large,
232.26	but copyright mathematicians who are media lobby experts
235.26	are merely surprised
237.26	that it doesn't get compounded for inflation every year.
240.26	Now when this law first passed,
242.26	the world's hottest MP3 player could hold just 10 songs.
245.26	And it was a big Christmas hit.
247.26	Because what little hoodlum wouldn't want
249.26	a million and a half bucks-worth of stolen goods in his pocket.
251.26	(Laughter)
254.26	(Applause)
259.26	These days an iPod Classic can hold 40,000 songs,
262.26	which is to say eight billion dollars-worth
265.26	of stolen media.
267.26	(Applause)
269.26	Or about 75,000 jobs.
271.26	(Laughter)
273.26	(Applause)
278.26	Now you might find copyright math strange,
281.26	but that's because it's a field
283.26	that's best left to experts.
285.26	So that's it for now.
287.26	I hope you'll join me next time
289.26	when I will be making an equally scientific and fact-based inquiry
292.26	into the cost of alien music piracy to he American economy.
295.26	Thank you very much.
297.26	(Applause)
299.26	Thank you.
301.26	(Applause)
