12.847	When the Portuguese arrived
12.847	in Latin America about 500 years ago,
17.818	they obviously found
17.818	this amazing tropical forest.
20.928	And among all this biodiversity
20.928	that they had never seen before,
25.165	they found one species that caught
25.165	their attention very quickly.
29.335	This species, when you cut the bark,
29.335	you find a very dark red resin
35.58	that was very good to paint
35.58	and dye fabric to make clothes.
41.354	The indigenous people called
41.354	this species pau brasil,
45.799	and that's the reason why this land became
45.799	"""land of Brasil,"" and later on, Brazil."
51.82	That's the only country in the world
51.82	that has the name of a tree.
56.356	So you can imagine that it's very cool
56.356	to be a forester in Brazil,
61.56	among other reasons.
63.507	Forest products are all around us.
66.393	Apart from all those products,
68.326	the forest is very important
68.326	for climate regulation.
72.219	In Brazil, almost 70 percent
72.219	of the evaporation that makes rain
77.453	actually comes from the forest.
79.894	Just the Amazon pumps to the atmosphere
88.984	This is more than what the Amazon River,
88.984	which is the largest river in the world,
93.456	puts in the sea per day,
93.456	which is 17 billion tons.
98.116	If we had to boil water to get
98.116	the same effect as evapotranspiration,
103.215	we would need six months of the entire
103.215	power generation capacity of the world.
109.722	So it's a hell of a service for all of us.
112.98	We have in the world
112.98	about four billion hectares of forests.
116.595	This is more or less China, U.S.,
116.595	Canada and Brazil all together,
122.232	in terms of size, to have an idea.
124.536	Three quarters of that
124.536	is in the temperate zone,
128.646	and just one quarter is in the tropics,
132.009	but this one quarter, one billion
132.009	hectares, holds most of the biodiversity,
138.023	and very importantly, 50 percent
138.023	of the living biomass, the carbon.
144.193	Now, we used to have
144.193	six billion hectares of forest --
	what we have -- 2,000 years ago.
152.072	We've actually lost two billion hectares
152.072	in the last 2,000 years.
155.638	But in the last 100 years,
155.638	we lost half of that.
159.915	That was when we shifted
159.915	from deforestation of temperate forests
164.614	to deforestation of tropical forests.
168.067	So think of this: In 100 years,
171.439	we lost the same amount
171.439	of forest in the tropics
175.275	that we lost in 2,000 years
175.275	in temperate forests.
178.916	That's the speed of the destruction
178.916	that we are having.
182.819	Now, Brazil is an important
182.819	piece of this puzzle.
186.895	We have the second largest
186.895	forest in the world, just after Russia.
190.655	It means 12 percent of all
190.655	the world's forests are in Brazil,
194.341	most of that in the Amazon.
196.153	It's the largest piece of forest we have.
196.153	It's a very big, large area.
199.597	You can see that you could fit
199.597	many of the European countries there.
202.979	We still have 80 percent
202.979	of the forest cover.
206.482	That's the good news.
208.111	But we lost 15 percent in just 30 years.
212.818	So if you go with that speed,
214.706	very soon, we will loose this powerful
214.706	pump that we have in the Amazon
219.745	that regulates our climate.
222.01	Deforestation was growing
222.01	fast and accelerating
224.873	at the end of the '90s
224.873	and the beginning of the 2000s.
227.714	(Chainsaw sound)
231.641	(Sound of falling tree)
235.598	Twenty-seven thousand
235.598	square kilometers in one year.
239.947	This is 2.7 million hectares.
243.602	It's almost like half
243.602	of Costa Rica every year.
249.654	So at this moment -- this is 2003, 2004 --
253.639	I happened to be coming to work
253.639	in the government.
258.116	And together with other teammates
258.116	in the National Forest Department,
262.566	we were assigned a task to join a team
262.566	and find out the causes of deforestation,
268.293	and make a plan to combat that
268.293	at a national level,
271.005	involving the local governments,
271.005	the civil society,
274.341	business, local communities,
276.184	in an effort that could
276.184	tackle those causes.
279.217	So we came up with this plan
279.217	with 144 actions in different areas.
285.019	Now I will go through
285.019	all of them one by one --
287.366	no, just giving some examples
287.366	of what we had done in the next few years.
294.17	So the first thing, we set up a system
294.17	with the national space agency
299.896	that could actually see
299.896	where deforestation is happening,
302.903	almost in real time.
304.404	So now in Brazil, 
304.404	we have this system, DETER,
306.788	where every month,
306.788	or every two months,
310.083	we get information on
310.083	where deforestation is happening
312.867	so we can actually act
312.867	when it's happening.
315.735	And all the information
315.735	is fully transparent
317.878	so others can replicate that
317.878	in independent systems.
320.862	This allows us, among other things,
322.841	to apprehend 1.4 million cubic meters
322.841	of logs that were illegally taken.
329.452	Part of that we saw and sell,
329.452	and all the revenue becomes a fund
335.067	that now funds conservation projects
335.067	of local communities as an endowment fund.
340.755	This also allows us
340.755	to make a big operation
343.189	to seize corruption and illegal activities
345.914	that ended up having 700 people in prison,
345.914	including a lot of public servants.
352.12	Then we made the connection
352.12	that areas that have been doing
356.172	illegal deforestation should not get
356.172	any kind of credit or finance.
360.525	So we cut this through the bank system
360.525	and then linked this to the end users.
365.037	So supermarkets,
365.037	the slaughterhouses, and so on
367.442	that buy products
367.442	from illegal clear-cut areas,
370.868	they also can be liable
370.868	for the deforestation.
374.526	So making all these connections to help
374.526	to push the problem down.
378.11	And also we work a lot
378.11	on land tenure issues.
381.503	It's very important for conflicts.
383.701	Fifty million hectares
383.701	of protected areas were created,
386.707	which is an area the size of Spain.
392.496	And of those, eight million
392.496	were indigenous lands.
396.743	Now we start to see results.
400.429	So in the last 10 years,
402.928	deforestation came down
402.928	in Brazil 75 percent.
406.532	(Applause)
412.143	So if we compare it
412.143	with the average deforestation
415.915	that we had in the last decade,
418.177	we saved 8.7 million hectares,
418.177	which is the size of Austria.
423.181	But more importantly,
423.181	it avoided the emission
425.694	of three billion tons
425.694	of CO2 in the atmosphere.
428.579	This is by far the largest contribution
428.579	to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
433.653	until today, as a positive action.
437.727	One may think that when you do
437.727	these kinds of actions
440.908	to decrease, to push down deforestation,
444.037	you will have an economic impact
446.135	because you will not have
446.135	economic activity or something like that.
450.297	But it's interesting to know
450.297	that it's quite the opposite.
453.084	In fact, in the period when we have
453.084	the deepest decline of deforestation,
457.959	the economy grew, on average,
457.959	double from the previous decade,
462.108	when deforestation was actually going up.
464.697	So it's a good lesson for us.
466.752	Maybe this is completely disconnected,
469.1	as we just learned by having
469.1	deforestation come down.
473.167	Now this is all good news,
473.167	and it's quite an achievement,
477.12	and we obviously should be
477.12	very proud about that.
480.448	But it's not even close to sufficient.
483.219	In fact, if you think about
483.219	the deforestation in the Amazon in 2013,
488.109	that was over half a million hectares,
491.748	which means that every minute,
494.412	an area the size of two soccer fields
497.785	is being cut in the Amazon
497.785	last year, just last year.
501.665	If we sum up the deforestation we have
501.665	in the other biomes in Brazil,
505.748	we are talking about still the largest
505.748	deforestation rate in the world.
511.114	It's more or less like
511.114	we are forest heroes,
514.459	but still deforestation champions.
517.629	So we can't be satisfied,
517.629	not even close to satisfied.
522.327	So the next step, I think,
524.136	is to fight to have zero loss
524.136	of forest cover in Brazil
528.687	and to have that as a goal for 2020.
532.062	That's our next step.
533.422	Now I've always been interested
533.422	in the relationship
536.407	between climate change and forests.
538.431	First, because 15 percent of greenhouse
538.431	gas emissions come from deforestation,
544.182	so it's a big part of the problem.
546.454	But also, forests can be
546.454	a big part of the solution
549.57	since that's the best way we know
549.57	to sink, capture and store carbon.
556.694	Now, there is another relationship
556.694	of climate and forests
559.487	that really stuck me in 2008
559.487	and made me change my career
563.553	from forests to working
563.553	with climate change.
567.039	I went to visit Canada,
567.039	in British Columbia,
569.724	together with the chiefs of
569.724	the forest services of other countries
574.738	that we have a kind of alliance of them,
574.738	like Canada, Russia, India, China, U.S.
581.143	And when we were there
581.143	we learned about this pine beetle
586.257	that is literally eating
586.257	the forests in Canada.
589.547	What we see here, those brown trees,
589.547	these are really dead trees.
595.819	They are standing dead trees
595.819	because of the larvae of the beetle.
600.384	What happens is that this beetle
603.429	is controlled by
603.429	the cold weather in the winter.
606.229	For many years now, they don't have
606.229	the sufficient cold weather
609.98	to actually control
609.98	the population of this beetle.
613.042	And it became a disease
613.042	that is really killing billions of trees.
620.284	So I came back with this notion
620.284	that the forest is actually
624.574	one of the earliest and most affected
624.574	victims of climate change.
629.843	So I was thinking,
631.503	if I succeed in working
631.503	with all my colleagues
635.967	to actually help to stop deforestation,
638.443	maybe we will lose the battle
638.443	later on for climate change
642.69	by floods, heat, fires and so on.
646.63	So I decided to leave the forest service
650.011	and start to work directly
650.011	on climate change,
653.415	find a way to think and understand
653.415	the challenge, and go from there.
657.463	Now, the challenge of climate change
657.463	is pretty straightforward.
662.051	The goal is very clear.
663.819	We want to limit the increase
663.819	of the average temperature
667.428	of the planet to two degrees.
670.001	There are several reasons for that.
671.737	I will not get into that now.
673.984	But in order to get
673.984	to this limit of two degrees,
677.441	which is possible for us to survive,
681.254	the IPCC, the Intergovernmental
681.254	Panel on Climate Change,
686.317	defines that we have a budget of emissions
686.317	of 1,000 billion tons of CO2
693.337	from now until the end of the century.
696.579	So if we divide this
696.579	by the number of years,
699.243	what we have is an average budget
699.243	of 11 billion tons of CO2 per year.
705.91	Now what is one ton of CO2?
708.118	It's more or less what one small car,
708.118	running 20 kilometers a day,
714.107	will emit in one year.
716.644	Or it's one flight, one way,
718.705	from São Paulo to Johannesburg
718.705	or to London, one way.
722.089	Two ways, two tons.
723.928	So 11 billion tons is twice that.
727.402	Now the emissions today
727.402	are 50 billion tons, and it's growing.
734.467	It's growing and maybe
734.467	it will be 61 by 2020.
738.895	Now we need to go down to 10 by 2050.
743.592	And while this happens,
745.367	the population will grow
745.367	from seven to nine billion people,
748.514	the economy will grow
748.514	from 60 trillion dollars in 2010
751.412	to 200 trillion dollars.
753.474	And so what we need to do
753.474	is to be much more efficient
757.484	in a way that we can go
757.484	from seven tons of carbon per capita
762.425	per person, per year,
762.425	into something like one.
767.307	You have to choose.
767.307	You take the airplane or you have a car.
772.338	So the question is, can we make it?
774.986	And that's the exactly the same question
776.903	I got when I was developing
776.903	a plan to combat deforestation.
781.048	It's such a big problem, so complex.
781.048	Can we really do it?
785.677	I think so. Think of this:
788.366	Deforestation means 60 percent
788.366	of the greenhouse gas emissions
793.677	in Brazil in the last decade.
795.516	Now it's a little bit
795.516	less than 30 percent.
797.587	In the world, 60 percent is energy.
801.487	So if we can tackle directly the energy,
805.026	the same way we could
805.026	tackle deforestation,
807.714	maybe we can have a chance.
809.89	So there are five things
809.89	that I think we should do.
813.547	First, we need to disconnect development
813.547	from carbon emissions.
817.893	We don't need to clear-cut all the forests
817.893	to actually get more jobs
823.982	and agriculture and have more economy.
825.795	That's what we proved
825.795	when we decreased deforestation
828.297	and the economy continued to grow.
830.113	Same thing could happen
830.113	in the energy sector.
834.51	Second, we have to move
834.51	the incentives to the right place.
837.793	Today, 500 billion dollars a year
837.793	goes into subsidies for fossil fuels.
843.05	Why don't we put a price on carbon
843.05	and transfer this to the renewable energy?
848.204	Third, we need to measure
848.204	and make it transparent
851.638	where, when and who
851.638	is emitting greenhouse gases
854.932	so we can have actions specifically
854.932	for each one of those opportunities.
859.128	Fourth, we need to leapfrog
859.128	the routes of development,
863.914	which means, you don't need
863.914	to go to the landline telephone
866.71	before you get to the mobile phones.
869.044	Same way we don't need
869.044	to go to fossil fuels
871.182	to the one billion people
871.182	who don't have access to energy
873.89	before we get to the clean energy.
876.084	And fifth and last,
877.97	we need to share responsibility
877.97	between governments,
880.668	business and civil society.
883.39	There is work to do for everybody,
883.39	and we need to have everybody on board.
888.309	So to finalize,
889.651	I think the future is not like a fate
893.371	that you have to just go
893.371	as business as usual goes.
896.109	We need to have the courage
896.109	to actually change the route,
899.911	invest in something new,
901.314	think that we can actually
901.314	change the route.
904.432	I think we are doing this
904.432	with deforestation in Brazil,
907.454	and I hope we can do it also
907.454	with climate change in the world.
910.585	Thank you.
911.691	(Applause)
