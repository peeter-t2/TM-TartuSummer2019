13.617	So when I was eight years old,
15.582	a new girl came to join the class,
17.74	and she was so impressive,
20.773	as the new girl always seems to be.
23.055	She had vast quantities of very shiny hair
25.733	and a cute little pencil case,
28.773	super strong on state capitals,
32.361	just a great speller.
34.853	And I just curdled with jealousy that year,
39.803	until I hatched my devious plan.
43.346	So one day I stayed a little late after school,
47.579	a little too late, and I lurked in the girls' bathroom.
51.659	When the coast was clear, I emerged,
53.994	crept into the classroom,
55.733	and took from my teacher's desk the grade book.
59.59	And then I did it.
61.926	I fiddled with my rival's grades,
64.293	just a little, just demoted some of those A's.
67.123	All of those A's. (Laughter)
70.222	And I got ready to return the book to the drawer,
73.965	when hang on, some of my other classmates
76.999	had appallingly good grades too.
80.492	So, in a frenzy,
82.54	I corrected everybody's marks,
84.528	not imaginatively.
86.437	I gave everybody a row of D's
88.951	and I gave myself a row of A's,
91.752	just because I was there, you know, might as well.
94.552	And I am still baffled by my behavior.
100.162	I don't understand where the idea came from.
102.574	I don't understand why I felt so great doing it.
105.903	I felt great.
107.426	I don't understand why I was never caught.
110.005	I mean, it should have been so blatantly obvious.
111.601	I was never caught.
112.914	But most of all, I am baffled by,
115.435	why did it bother me so much
116.942	that this little girl, this tiny little girl,
118.886	was so good at spelling?
120.6	Jealousy baffles me.
122.71	It's so mysterious, and it's so pervasive.
125.634	We know babies suffer from jealousy.
128.1	We know primates do. Bluebirds are actually very prone.
131.75	We know that jealousy is the number one cause
135.27	of spousal murder in the United States.
138.186	And yet, I have never read a study
141.29	that can parse to me its loneliness
144.205	or its longevity or its grim thrill.
149.059	For that, we have to go to fiction,
151.906	because the novel is the lab
154.246	that has studied jealousy
155.82	in every possible configuration.
157.894	In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say
161.218	that if we didn't have jealousy,
163.25	would we even have literature?
165.8	"Well no faithless Helen, no ""Odyssey."""
169.39	"No jealous king, no ""Arabian Nights."""
172.228	No Shakespeare.
175.365	There goes high school reading lists,
177.555	"because we're losing ""Sound and the Fury,"""
179.367	"we're losing ""Gatsby,"" ""Sun Also Rises,"""
181.616	"we're losing ""Madame Bovary,"" ""Anna K."""
185.743	No jealousy, no Proust. And now, I mean,
188.15	I know it's fashionable to say that Proust
189.911	has the answers to everything,
191.518	but in the case of jealousy,
194.224	he kind of does.
196.965	"This year is the centennial of his masterpiece, ""In Search of Lost Time,"""
200.951	and it's the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy
204.952	and just regular competitiveness, my brand,
207.104	that we can hope to have. (Laughter)
209.689	And we think about Proust, we think
212.116	about the sentimental bits, right?
213.61	We think about a little boy trying to get to sleep.
215.565	We think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea.
219.746	We forget how harsh his vision was.
221.772	We forget how pitiless he is.
223.612	I mean, these are books that Virginia Woolf said
225.933	were tough as cat gut.
228.269	I don't know what cat gut is,
230.317	but let's assume it's formidable.
233.218	Let's look at why they go so well together,
236.436	the novel and jealousy, jealousy and Proust.
240.114	Is it something as obvious as that jealousy,
243.345	which boils down into person, desire, impediment,
246.728	is such a solid narrative foundation?
251.396	I don't know. I think it cuts very close to the bone,
254.071	because let's think about what happens
256.12	when we feel jealous.
257.898	When we feel jealous, we tell ourselves a story.
261.85	We tell ourselves a story about other people's lives,
266.133	and these stories make us feel terrible
268.807	because they're designed to make us feel terrible.
271.03	As the teller of the tale and the audience,
273.564	we know just what details to include,
275.538	to dig that knife in. Right?
279.107	Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists,
282.462	and this is something Proust understood.
284.478	In the first volume, Swann's Way,
287.651	the series of books,
289.475	Swann, one of the main characters,
291.181	is thinking very fondly of his mistress
294.409	and how great she is in bed,
296.101	and suddenly, in the course of a few sentences,
299.143	and these are Proustian sentences,
301.184	so they're long as rivers,
302.696	but in the course of a few sentences,
304.959	he suddenly recoils and he realizes,
307.366	"""Hang on, everything I love about this woman,"
310.649	somebody else would love about this woman.
314.42	Everything that she does that gives me pleasure
317.511	could be giving somebody else pleasure,
319.22	"maybe right about now."""
321.498	And this is the story he starts to tell himself,
324.282	and from then on, Proust writes that
326.145	every fresh charm Swann detects in his mistress,
329.192	"he adds to his ""collection of instruments"
331.856	"in his private torture chamber."""
335.478	Now Swann and Proust, we have to admit,
337.753	were notoriously jealous.
339.429	You know, Proust's boyfriends would have to leave
341.133	the country if they wanted to break up with him.
343.737	But you don't have to be that jealous
346.64	to concede that it's hard work. Right?
349.551	Jealousy is exhausting.
351.16	It's a hungry emotion. It must be fed.
354.807	And what does jealousy like?
356.896	Jealousy likes information.
359.986	Jealousy likes details.
362.375	Jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair,
365.198	the cute little pencil case.
367.664	Jealousy likes photos.
369.206	That's why Instagram is such a hit. (Laughter)
372.936	Proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy.
376.897	When Swann is in his jealous throes,
379.339	and suddenly he's listening at doorways
381.51	and bribing his mistress' servants,
383.533	he defends these behaviors.
384.985	"He says, ""You know, look, I know you think this is repugnant,"
387.402	but it is no different
389.208	from interpreting an ancient text
391.558	"or looking at a monument."""
393.225	"He says, ""They are scientific investigations"
395.822	"with real intellectual value."""
398.825	Proust is trying to show us that jealousy
400.937	feels intolerable and makes us look absurd,
403.828	but it is, at its crux, a quest for knowledge,
408.498	a quest for truth, painful truth,
411.899	and actually, where Proust is concerned,
413.828	the more painful the truth, the better.
416.62	Grief, humiliation, loss:
421.357	These were the avenues to wisdom for Proust.
424.313	"He says, ""A woman whom we need,"
428.215	who makes us suffer, elicits from us
431.001	a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital
434.506	"than a man of genius who interests us."""
438.945	Is he telling us to just go and find cruel women?
441.82	No. I think he's trying to say
444.117	that jealousy reveals us to ourselves.
447.286	And does any other emotion crack us open
450.182	in this particular way?
452.51	Does any other emotion reveal to us
454.59	our aggression and our hideous ambition
457.923	and our entitlement?
460.322	Does any other emotion teach us to look
462.972	with such peculiar intensity?
466.164	Freud would write about this later.
468.316	One day, Freud was visited
470.57	by this very anxious young man who was consumed
472.892	with the thought of his wife cheating on him.
475.395	And Freud says, it's something strange about this guy,
477.472	because he's not looking at what his wife is doing.
479.586	Because she's blameless; everybody knows it.
481.557	The poor creature is just
482.887	under suspicion for no cause.
484.885	But he's looking for things that his wife is doing
487.694	without noticing, unintentional behaviors.
490.194	Is she smiling too brightly here,
492.511	or did she accidentally brush up against a man there?
495.851	[Freud] says that the man is becoming
498.527	the custodian of his wife's unconscious.
502.875	The novel is very good on this point.
504.696	The novel is very good at describing how jealousy
507.504	trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy.
511.488	In fact, the more intensely jealous we are,
515.563	the more we become residents of fantasy.
518.082	And this is why, I think, jealousy doesn't
521.002	just provoke us to do violent things
523.818	or illegal things.
525.818	Jealousy prompts us to behave in ways
528.1	that are wildly inventive.
530.458	Now I'm thinking of myself at eight, I concede,
532.901	but I'm also thinking of this story I heard on the news.
536.92	A 52-year-old Michigan woman was caught
540.828	creating a fake Facebook account
543.697	from which she sent vile, hideous messages
547.42	to herself for a year.
551.645	For a year. A year.
553.77	And she was trying to frame
555.645	her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend,
557.802	and I have to confess when I heard this,
561.443	I just reacted with admiration.
563.355	(Laughter)
564.932	Because, I mean, let's be real.
567.347	What immense, if misplaced, creativity. Right?
571.664	This is something from a novel.
574.084	This is something from a Patricia Highsmith novel.
577.485	Now Highsmith is a particular favorite of mine.
579.655	She is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of American letters.
583.707	"She's the author of ""Strangers on a Train"""
585.9	"and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"""
587.948	books that are all about how jealousy,
591.013	it muddles our minds,
592.888	and once we're in the sphere, in that realm of jealousy,
595.882	the membrane between what is and what could be
601.145	can be pierced in an instant.
604.038	Take Tom Ripley, her most famous character.
606.486	Now, Tom Ripley goes from wanting you
609.325	or wanting what you have
611.501	to being you and having what you once had,
614.929	and you're under the floorboards,
616.462	he's answering to your name,
617.825	he's wearing your rings,
619.517	emptying your bank account.
621.518	That's one way to go.
623.493	But what do we do? We can't go the Tom Ripley route.
627.157	I can't give the world D's,
629.194	as much as I would really like to, some days.
632.041	And it's a pity, because we live in envious times.
635.539	We live in jealous times.
638.446	I mean, we're all good citizens of social media,
640.459	aren't we, where the currency is envy?
643.843	Does the novel show us a way out? I'm not sure.
648.312	So let's do what characters always do when they're not sure,
651.753	when they are in possession of a mystery.
653.929	Let's go to 221B Baker Street
656.203	and ask for Sherlock Holmes.
658.221	When people think of Holmes,
660.69	they think of his nemesis being Professor Moriarty,
663.799	right, this criminal mastermind.
666.006	But I've always preferred [Inspector] Lestrade,
668.469	who is the rat-faced head of Scotland Yard
671.374	who needs Holmes desperately,
673.104	needs Holmes' genius, but resents him.
675.408	Oh, it's so familiar to me.
677.265	So Lestrade needs his help, resents him,
681.282	and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries.
684.593	But as they work together, something starts to change,
688.47	"and finally in ""The Adventure of the Six Napoleons,"""
691.513	once Holmes comes in, dazzles everybody with his solution,
695.443	Lestrade turns to Holmes and he says,
698.884	"""We're not jealous of you, Mr. Holmes."
703.165	"We're proud of you."""
706.524	And he says that there's not a man at Scotland Yard
708.853	who wouldn't want to shake Sherlock Holmes' hand.
711.852	It's one of the few times we see Holmes moved
714.237	in the mysteries, and I find it very moving,
716.332	this little scene, but it's also mysterious, right?
719.396	It seems to treat jealousy
721.309	as a problem of geometry, not emotion.
724.047	You know, one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade.
726.913	The next minute they're on the same side.
728.836	Suddenly, Lestrade is letting himself
730.983	admire this mind that he's resented.
733.95	Could it be so simple though?
735.879	What if jealousy really is a matter of geometry,
738.31	just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand
742.02	in relation to another?
744.35	Well, maybe then we wouldn't have to resent
746.221	somebody's excellence.
748.282	We could align ourselves with it.
751.656	But I like contingency plans.
753.912	So while we wait for that to happen,
756.248	let us remember that we have fiction for consolation.
758.944	Fiction alone demystifies jealousy.
761.395	Fiction alone domesticates it,
763.478	invites it to the table.
765.356	And look who it gathers:
767.229	sweet Lestrade, terrifying Tom Ripley,
771.065	crazy Swann, Marcel Proust himself.
775.534	We are in excellent company.
777.948	Thank you.
779.368	(Applause)
