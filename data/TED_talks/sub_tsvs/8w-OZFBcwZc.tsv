12.332	"""Iran is Israel's best friend,"
14.402	and we do not intend to change our position
17.111	"in relation to Tehran."""
20.591	Believe it or not, this is a quote
22.314	from an Israeli prime minister,
24.513	but it's not Ben-Gurion or Golda Meir
26.957	from the era of the Shah.
29.15	It's actually from Yitzhak Rabin.
31.568	The year is 1987.
34.054	Ayatollah Khomeini is still alive,
35.975	and much like Ahmadinejad today,
37.913	he's using the worst rhetoric against Israel.
40.813	Yet, Rabin referred to Iran
43.692	as a geostrategic friend.
46.942	Today, when we hear the threats of war
49.638	and the high rhetoric,
51.044	we're oftentimes led to believe
52.675	that this is yet another one of those unsolvable
55.958	Middle Eastern conflicts
57.833	with roots as old as the region itself.
61.561	Nothing could be further from the truth,
65.45	and I hope today to show you why that is.
69.482	The relations between the Iranian and the Jewish people
71.82	throughout history has actually been quite positive,
74.3	starting in 539 B.C.,
76.7	when King Cyrus the Great of Persia
78.589	liberated the Jewish people from their Babylonian captivity.
82.283	A third of the Jewish population
84.754	stayed in Babylonia.
86.32	They're today's Iraqi Jews.
88.57	A third migrated to Persia.
91.676	They're today's Iranian Jews,
93.752	still 25,000 of them living in Iran,
96.783	making them the largest Jewish community
98.695	in the Middle East outside of Israel itself.
101.943	And a third returned to historic Palestine,
104.574	did the second rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem,
107.625	financed, incidentally, by Persian tax money.
112.774	But even in modern times,
114.86	relations have been close at times.
117.305	Rabin's statement was a reflection
120.106	of decades of security and intelligence collaboration
124.064	between the two, which in turn
126.6	was born out of perception of common threats.
130.597	Both states feared the Soviet Union
133.412	and strong Arab states such as Egypt and Iraq.
138.559	And, in addition, the Israeli doctrine of the periphery,
142.8	the idea that Israel's security was best achieved
146.092	by creating alliances with the non-Arab states
150.17	in the periphery of the region
152.076	in order to balance the Arab states in its vicinity.
156.965	Now, from the Shah's perspective, though,
159.433	he wanted to keep this as secret as possible,
163.087	so when Yitzhak Rabin, for instance,
165.335	traveled to Iran in the '70s,
167.227	he usually wore a wig
168.675	so that no one would recognize him.
171.086	The Iranians built a special tarmac
173.521	at the airport in Tehran, far away from the central terminal,
176.773	so that no one would notice the large number
179.078	of Israeli planes shuttling between Tel Aviv and Tehran.
184.499	Now, did all of this end with the Islamic revolution
187.686	in 1979?
190.639	In spite of the very clear anti-Israeli ideology
193.706	of the new regime, the geopolitical logic
197.099	for their collaboration lived on,
199.703	because they still had common threats.
202.515	And when Iraq invaded Iran in 1980,
205.544	Israel feared an Iraqi victory
208.034	and actively helped Iran by selling it arms
210.785	and providing it with spare parts
213.037	for Iran's American weaponry
215.197	at a moment when Iran was very vulnerable
218.913	because of an American arms embargo
221.415	that Israel was more than happy to violate.
224.403	In fact, back in the 1980s,
227.161	it was Israel that lobbied Washington
229.97	to talk to Iran, to sell arms to Iran,
234.079	and not pay attention to Iran's anti-Israeli ideology.
239.703	And this, of course, climaxed
241.642	in the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s.
246.293	But with the end of the Cold War
248.293	came also the end of the Israeli-Iranian cold peace.
252.731	Suddenly, the two common threats
255.091	that had pushed them closer together throughout decades,
258.144	more or less evaporated.
260.59	The Soviet Union collapsed,
262.552	Iraq was defeated,
264.244	and a new environment was created in the region
266.325	in which both of them felt more secure,
268.665	but they were also now left unchecked.
271.585	Without Iraq balancing Iran,
274.7	Iran could now become a threat,
276.878	some in Israel argued.
279.41	In fact, the current dynamic
282.355	that you see between Iran and Israel
284.447	has its roots more so
286.542	in the geopolitical reconfiguration of the region
289.195	after the Cold War
290.984	than in the events of 1979,
293.484	because at this point, Iran and Israel
296.181	emerge as two of the most powerful states in the region,
300.069	and rather than viewing each other
301.312	as potential security partners,
303.788	they increasingly came to view each other
306	as rivals and competitors.
309.558	So Israel, who in the 1980s
311.359	lobbied for and improved U.S.-Iran relations
314.884	now feared a U.S.-Iran rapprochement,
318.267	thinking that it would come
319.561	at Israel's security interests' expense,
323.223	and instead sought to put Iran
325.355	in increased isolation.
327.889	Ironically, this was happening at a time
330.817	when Iran was more interested
332.884	in peacemaking with Washington
335.034	than to see to Israel's destruction.
338.469	Iran had put itself in isolation
340.309	because of its radicalism,
342.176	and after having helped the United States indirectly
345.095	in the war against Iraq in 1991,
347.367	the Iranians were hoping
349.323	that they would be rewarded by being included
353.225	in the post-war security architecture of the region.
357.955	But Washington chose to ignore Iran's outreach,
361.507	as it would a decade later in Afghanistan,
363.943	and instead moved to intensify Iran's isolation,
368.138	and it is at this point, around 1993, '94,
371.372	that Iran begins to translate
374.084	its anti-Israeli ideology
376.311	into operational policy.
378.706	The Iranians believed that whatever they did,
380.985	even if they moderated their policies,
383.295	the U.S. would continue to seek Iran's isolation,
386.597	and the only way Iran could compel Washington
390.251	to change its position was by imposing a cost
393.547	on the U.S. if it didn't.
396.86	The easiest target was the peace process,
400.95	and now the Iranian ideological bark
403.327	was to be accompanied by a nonconventional bite,
407.566	and Iran began supporting extensively
411.543	Palestinian Islamist groups that it previously
414.242	had shunned.
417.633	In some ways, this sounds paradoxical,
420.848	but according to Martin Indyk
422.968	of the Clinton administration,
424.841	the Iranians had not gotten it entirely wrong,
427.74	because the more peace there would be
429.281	between Israel and Palestine,
431.444	the U.S. believed, the more Iran would get isolated.
434.807	The more Iran got isolated, the more peace there would be.
437.943	So according to Indyk, and these are his words,
440.391	the Iranians had an interest to do us in
443.579	on the peace process
445.246	in order to defeat our policy of containment.
448.958	To defeat our policy of containment,
451.324	not about ideology.
455.31	But throughout even the worst times of their entanglement,
459.015	all sides have reached out to each other.
462.278	Netanyahu, when he got elected in 1996,
465.547	reached out to the Iranians to see
467.343	if there were any ways that
469.046	the doctrine of the periphery could be resurrected.
472.235	Tehran was not interested.
474.705	A few years later, the Iranians sent
477.67	a comprehensive negotiation proposal to the Bush administration,
481.129	a proposal that revealed that there was some potential
485.137	of getting Iran and Israel back on terms again.
489	The Bush administration did not even respond.
492.26	All sides have never missed an opportunity
495.08	to miss an opportunity.
500.897	But this is not an ancient conflict.
505.569	This is not even an ideological conflict.
508.528	The ebbs and flows of hostility
511.322	have not shifted with ideological zeal,
514.598	but rather with changes in the geopolitical landscape.
517.2	When Iran and Israel's security imperatives
519.531	dictated collaboration, they did so
522.233	in spite of lethal ideological opposition to each other.
525.809	When Iran's ideological impulses collided
528.725	with its strategic interests,
530.955	the strategic interests always prevailed.
534.618	This is good news, because it means
537.611	that neither war nor enmity
540.197	is a foregone conclusion.
543.867	But some want war.
546.422	Some believe or say that it's 1938,
549.626	Iran is Germany,
551.538	and Ahmadinejad is Hitler.
554.704	If we accept this to be true,
556.569	that indeed it is 1938, Iran is Germany,
559.921	Ahmadinejad is Hitler,
562.328	then the question we have to ask ourself is,
565.163	who wishes to play the role of Neville Chamberlain?
568.976	Who will risk peace?
571.842	This is an analogy that is deliberately aimed
574.456	at eliminating diplomacy,
577.216	and when you eliminate diplomacy,
579.628	you make war inevitable.
582.717	In an ideological conflict, there can be no truce,
585.832	no draw, no compromise,
587.997	only victory or defeat.
591.279	But rather than making war inevitable
594.469	by viewing this as ideological,
597.673	we would be wise to seek ways
599.712	to make peace possible.
602.7	Iran and Israel's conflict is a new phenomenon,
606.196	only a few decades old
608.186	in a history of 2,500 years,
610.812	and precisely because its roots are geopolitical,
614.799	it means that solutions can be found,
617.639	compromises can be struck,
620.326	however difficult it yet may be.
623.145	After all, it was Yitzhak Rabin himself who said,
627.137	"""You don't make peace with your friends."
630.123	"You make it with your enemies."""
632.503	Thank you.
633.938	(Applause)
