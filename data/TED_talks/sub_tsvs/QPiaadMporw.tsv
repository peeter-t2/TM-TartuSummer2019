15.752	I'm gonna talk a little bit about open-source security,
20.602	because we've got to get better at security
22.626	in this 21st century.
24.646	Let me start by saying, let's look back to the 20th century,
29.333	and kind of get a sense of how that style of security
33.002	worked for us.
34.48	This is Verdun, a battlefield in France
37.772	just north of the NATO headquarters in Belgium.
41.089	At Verdun, in 1916, over a 300-day period,
50.833	so about 2,000 a day.
52.892	If you roll it forward -- 20th-century security --
57.22	into the Second World War,
60.123	you see the Battle of Stalingrad,
66.173	We go into the Cold War, and we continue
68.959	to try and build walls.
71.738	We go from the trench warfare of the First World War
75.79	to the Maginot Line of the Second World War,
79.369	and then we go into the Cold War,
81.798	the Iron Curtain, the Berlin Wall.
84.736	Walls don't work.
86.963	My thesis for us today is, instead of building walls
91.295	to create security, we need to build bridges.
94.951	This is a famous bridge in Europe.
97.375	It's in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
99.497	It's the bridge over the Drina River,
101.736	the subject of a novel by Ivo Andrić,
104.562	and it talks about how,
106.32	in that very troubled part of Europe and the Balkans,
110.186	over time there's been enormous building of walls.
114.329	More recently, in the last decade, we begin to see
117.42	these communities start, hesitatingly,
121.11	to come together.
122.663	I would argue, again, open-source security
126.836	is about connecting the international,
129.672	the interagency, the private-public,
133.419	and lashing it together with strategic communication,
137.184	largely in social networks.
139.652	So let me talk a little bit about why we need to do that,
144.017	because our global commons is under attack
147.764	in a variety of ways,
149.747	and none of the sources of threat to the global commons
153.513	will be solved by building walls.
156.342	Now, I'm a sailor, obviously.
158.648	This is a ship, a liner, clipping through the Indian Ocean.
163.257	What's wrong with this picture?
165.878	It's got concertina wire along the sides of it.
169.389	That's to prevent pirates from attacking it.
172.145	Piracy is a very active threat today
175.252	around the world. This is in the Indian Ocean.
178.581	Piracy is also very active in the Strait of Malacca.
182.372	It's active in the Gulf of Guinea.
184.448	We see it in the Caribbean.
186.205	It's a $10-billion-a-year discontinuity
188.992	in the global transport system.
192.558	Last year, at this time, there were 20 vessels,
198.6	This is an attack on the global commons.
202.223	We need to think about how to address it.
205.009	Let's shift to a different kind of sea,
207.459	the cyber sea.
209.837	Here are photographs of two young men.
213.074	At the moment, they're incarcerated.
215.471	They conducted a credit card fraud that netted them
220.95	over 10 billion dollars.
224.27	This is part of cybercrime which is a $2-trillion-a-year
229.296	discontinuity in the global economy.
232.322	Two trillion a year.
233.668	That's just under the GDP of Great Britain.
237.13	So this cyber sea, which we know endlessly
240.057	is the fundamental piece of radical openness,
244.053	is very much under threat as well.
248.583	Another thing I worry about in the global commons
251.606	is the threat posed by trafficking,
254.366	by the movement of narcotics, opium,
258.9	here coming out of Afghanistan through Europe
262.264	over to the United States.
263.674	We worry about cocaine
265.831	coming from the Andean Ridge north.
268.216	We worry about the movement of illegal weapons
271.434	and trafficking. Above all, perhaps,
273.853	we worry about human trafficking, and the awful cost of it.
277.824	Trafficking moves largely at sea
280.479	but in other parts of the global commons.
282.966	This is a photograph, and I wish I could tell you
287.579	that this is a very high-tech piece of US Navy gear
292.451	that we're using to stop the trafficking.
295.14	The bad news is,
296.94	this is a semi-submersible run by drug cartels.
302.565	It was built in the jungles of South America.
306.738	We caught it with that low-tech raft — (Laughter) —
311.6	and it was carrying six tons of cocaine.
315.482	Crew of four. Sophisticated communications sweep.
319.953	This kind of trafficking, in narcotics, in humans, in weapons,
325.015	God forbid, in weapons of mass destruction,
327.92	is part of the threat to the global commons.
330.809	And let's pull it together in Afghanistan today.
334.963	This is a field of poppies in Afghanistan.
337.709	Eighty to 90 percent of the world's poppy,
341.017	opium and heroin, comes out of Afghanistan.
344.336	We also see there, of course, terrorism.
347.115	This is where al Qaeda is staged from.
349.417	We also see a very strong insurgency embedded there.
354.023	So this terrorism concern is also part
357.803	of the global commons, and what we must address.
361.876	So here we are, 21st century.
365.189	We know our 20th-century tools are not going to work.
368.908	What should we do?
371.473	I would argue that we will not deliver security
376.238	solely from the barrel of a gun.
378.691	We will not deliver security solely from the barrel of a gun.
382.854	We will need the application of military force.
385.757	When we do it, we must do it well, and competently.
388.851	But my thesis is, open-source security is about international,
395.016	interagency, private-public connection pulled together
399.551	by this idea of strategic communication on the Internet.
405.84	Let me give you a couple of examples of how this works in a positive way.
409.401	This is Afghanistan. These are Afghan soldiers.
413.872	They are all holding books.
416.19	"You should say, ""That's odd. I thought I read that"
420.994	this demographic, young men and women
424.49	"in their 20s and 30s, is largely illiterate in Afghanistan."""
429.459	You would be correct.
431.2	Eighty-five percent cannot read
433.397	when they enter the security forces of Afghanistan.
436.457	Why? Because the Taliban withheld education
439.604	during the period of time in which these men and women
442.888	would have learned to read.
444.279	So the question is, so,
446.022	why are they all standing there holding books?
449.363	The answer is, we are teaching them to read
453.056	in literacy courses by NATO
456.424	in partnership with private sector entities,
459.919	in partnership with development agencies.
463.306	We've taught well over 200,000 Afghan Security Forces
467.767	to read and write at a basic level.
470.315	When you can read and write in Afghanistan,
473.098	you will typically put a pen in your pocket.
476.237	At the ceremonies, when these young men and women
478.825	graduate, they take that pen with great pride,
482.369	and put it in their pocket.
484.469	This is bringing together international
487.411	— there are 50 nations involved in this mission —
490.257	interagency — these development agencies —
493.103	and private-public, to take on this kind of security.
497.193	Now, we are also teaching them combat skills, of course,
500.827	but I would argue, open-source security
503.595	means connecting in ways that create
506.279	longer lasting security effect.
509.131	Here's another example.
511.431	This is a US Navy warship.
514.87	It's called the Comfort.
516.789	There's a sister ship called the Mercy.
519.526	They are hospital ships.
521.661	This one, the Comfort, operates throughout
523.743	the Caribbean and the coast of South America
527.354	conducting patient treatments.
529.342	On a typical cruise, they'll do 400,000 patient treatments.
534.083	It is crewed not strictly by military
537.874	but by a combination of humanitarian organizations:
541.778	Operation Hope, Project Smile.
545.046	Other organizations send volunteers.
548.632	Interagency physicians come out.
550.887	They're all part of this.
553.016	To give you one example of the impact this can have,
555.921	this little boy, eight years old,
559.15	walked with his mother two days
562.369	to come to the eye clinic put on by the Comfort.
565.461	When he was fitted, over his extremely myopic eyes,
570.829	he suddenly looked up and said,
573.975	"""Mama, veo el mundo."""
577.213	"""Mom, I see the world."""
580.101	Multiply this by 400,000 patient treatments,
583.559	this private-public collaboration with security forces,
588.228	and you begin to see the power
590.297	of creating security in a very different way.
594.093	Here you see baseball players.
598.39	Can you pick out the two US Army soldiers
602.21	in this photograph?
604.167	They are the two young men on either side
606.362	of these young boys. This is part of a series
609.377	of baseball clinics, where we have explored collaboration
613.22	between Major League Baseball,
615.328	the Department of State,
616.684	who sets up the diplomatic piece of this,
619.075	military baseball players, who are real soldiers
623.3	with real skills but participate in this mission,
627.333	and they put on clinics
629.235	throughout Latin America and the Caribbean,
631.321	in Honduras, in Nicaragua,
634.681	in all of the Central American and Caribbean nations
639.383	where baseball is so popular,
641.173	and it creates security.
643.429	It shows role models to young men and women
645.887	about fitness and about life that I would argue
649.487	help create security for us.
653.652	Another aspect of this partnership
656.249	is in disaster relief.
658.2	This is a US Air Force helicopter participating
661.947	after the tsunami in 2004 which killed 250,000 people.
668.901	In each of these major disasters — the tsunami in 2004,
682.312	the Haitian earthquake, about 300,000 dead,
686.981	more recently the awful earthquake-tsunami combination
691.872	which struck Japan and its nuclear industry —
695.236	in all of these instances, we see partnerships
698.323	between international actors,
701.645	interagency, private-public working with security forces
705.553	to respond to this kind of natural disaster.
709.379	So these are examples of this idea of open-source security.
713.731	We tie it together, increasingly, by doing things like this.
718.402	"Now, you're looking at this thinking, ""Ah, Admiral,"
721.313	these must be sea lanes of communication,
724.499	"or these might be fiber optic cables."""
727.299	No. This is a graphic of the world according to Twitter.
732.491	Purple are tweets. Green are geolocation.
739.059	White is the synthesis.
741.105	It's a perfect evocation of that great population survey,
745.19	the six largest nations in the world in descending order:
748.937	China, India, Facebook, the United States,
751.615	Twitter and Indonesia. (Laughter)
755.937	Why do we want to get in these nets?
757.7	Why do we want to be involved?
759.51	We talked earlier about the Arab Spring,
761.366	and the power of all this.
762.767	I'll give you another example,
764.11	and it's how you move this message.
766.363	I gave a talk like this in London a while back
768.696	about this point. I said, as I say to all of you,
772.084	I'm on Facebook. Friend me.
774.23	Got a little laugh from the audience.
776.357	There was an article which was run by AP, on the wire.
781.588	Got picked up in two places in the world:
784.104	Finland and Indonesia.
786.452	The headline was: NATO Admiral Needs Friends.
790.342	(Laughter)
791.825	Thank you. (Applause)
794.369	Which I do. (Laughter)
796.923	And the story was a catalyst,
799.48	and the next morning I had hundreds
802.199	of Facebook friend requests
803.834	from Indonesians and Finns,
806.351	"mostly saying, ""Admiral, we heard you need a friend,"
809.333	"and oh, by the way, what is NATO?"" (Laughter)"
812.935	So ... (Laughter)
814.987	Yeah, we laugh, but this is how we move the message,
819.073	and moving that message is how we connect
821.808	international, interagency, private-public,
824.259	and these social nets to help create security.
828.129	Now, let me hit a somber note.
831.562	This is a photograph of a brave British soldier.
835.32	He's in the Scots Guards.
837.526	He's standing the watch in Helmand,
839.272	in southern Afghanistan.
841.536	I put him here to remind us,
844.192	I would not want anyone to leave the room thinking
847.519	that we do not need capable, competent militaries
851.732	who can create real military effect.
854.967	That is the core of who we are and what we do,
858.062	and we do it to protect freedom, freedom of speech,
862.118	all the things we treasure in our societies.
865.083	But, you know, life is not an on-and-off switch.
869.342	You don't have to have a military that is either
871.731	in hard combat or is in the barracks.
875.534	I would argue life is a rheostat.
880.317	You have to dial it in,
882.846	and as I think about how we create security
886.115	in this 21st century, there will be times
888.767	when we will apply hard power in true war and crisis,
893.896	but there will be many instances,
895.817	as we've talked about today,
897.575	where our militaries can be part of creating
904.821	interagency, private-public,
907.229	connected with competent communication.
911.785	I would close by saying that we heard earlier today
916.272	about Wikipedia. I use Wikipedia all the time
920.235	to look up facts, and as all of you appreciate,
923.396	Wikipedia is not created by 12 brilliant people
927.549	locked in a room writing articles.
930.024	Wikipedia, every day, is tens of thousands of people
933.737	inputting information, and every day millions of people
938.537	withdrawing that information.
940.4	It's a perfect image for the fundamental point
944.02	that no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together.
948.642	No one person, no one alliance, no one nation,
952.302	no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together.
957.083	The vision statement of Wikipedia is very simple:
961.765	a world in which every human being can freely share
964.879	in the sum of all knowledge.
966.512	My thesis for you is that by combining international,
970.99	interagency, private-public, strategic communication,
975.16	together, in this 21st century,
978.625	we can create the sum of all security.
981.892	Thank you. (Applause)
984.349	Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)
