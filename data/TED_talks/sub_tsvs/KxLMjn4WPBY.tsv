	to participate in a research study
18.08	that involved a genetic test.
20.64	When I arrived at the clinic to be tested,
22.672	I was handed a questionnaire.
25.08	One of the very first questions
25.08	asked me to check a box for my race:
29.32	White, black, Asian, or Native American.
33.68	I wasn't quite sure
33.68	how to answer the question.
37.2	Was it aimed at measuring the diversity
39.6	of research participants'
39.6	social backgrounds?
43.2	In that case, I would answer
43.2	with my social identity,
46.84	"and check the box for ""black."""
49.48	But what if the researchers
49.48	were interested in investigating
53.04	some association between ancestry
53.04	and the risk for certain genetic traits?
59.16	In that case, wouldn't they want to know
59.16	something about my ancestry,
63.72	which is just as much European as African?
67	And how could they make
67	scientific findings about my genes
71.64	if I put down my social identity
71.64	as a black woman?
76.48	After all, I consider myself
76.48	a black woman with a white father
81.64	rather than a white woman
81.64	with a black mother
85.08	entirely for social reasons.
87.8	Which racial identity I check
90.28	has nothing to do with my genes.
94.08	Well, despite the obvious
94.08	importance of this question
97.48	to the study's scientific validity,
100	"I was told, ""Don't worry about it,"
102.56	just put down however
102.56	"you identify yourself."""
106.2	"So I check ""black,"""
108.6	but I had no confidence
108.6	in the results of a study
112.32	that treated a critical variable
112.32	so unscientifically.
118.36	That personal experience
118.36	with the use of race in genetic testing
122.72	got me thinking:
124.32	Where else in medicine is race used
124.32	to make false biological predictions?
130.72	Well, I found out that race runs deeply
130.72	throughout all of medical practice.
137	It shapes physicians' diagnoses,
140.039	measurements, treatments,
142.68	prescriptions,
144.32	even the very definition of diseases.
148.4	And the more I found out,
148.4	the more disturbed I became.
153.72	Sociologists like me have long explained
156.84	that race is a social construction.
159.76	When we identify people as black,
159.76	white, Asian, Native American, Latina,
166.28	we're referring to social groupings
169.04	with made up demarcations
169.04	that have changed over time
172.76	and vary around the world.
175.32	As a legal scholar, I've also studied
178.56	how lawmakers, not biologists,
181	have invented the legal
181	definitions of races.
186.64	And it's not just the view
186.64	of social scientists.
190.12	You remember when the map
190.12	of the human genome
192.76	was unveiled at a White House
192.76	ceremony in June 2000?
197.04	President Bill Clinton famously declared,
200.68	"""I believe one of the great truths"
202.88	to emerge from this triumphant expedition
206.08	inside the human genome
207.92	is that in genetic terms,
209.8	human beings, regardless of race,
212.64	"are more than 99.9 percent the same."""
216.92	And he might have added
218.52	that that less than one percent
218.52	of genetic difference
222.24	doesn't fall into racial boxes.
225.44	Francis Collins, who led
225.44	the Human Genome Project
229.12	and now heads NIH,
230.84	echoed President Clinton.
232.92	"""I am happy that today,"
234.88	the only race we're talking about
234.88	"is the human race."""
240.4	Doctors are supposed to practice
240.4	evidence-based medicine,
244.4	and they're increasingly called
244.4	to join the genomic revolution.
248.36	But their habit of treating patients
248.36	by race lags far behind.
254.2	Take the estimate
255.44	of glomerular filtration rate, or GFR.
258.72	Doctors routinely interpret GFR,
262.28	this important indicator
262.28	of kidney function, by race.
267.84	As you can see in this lab test,
271.72	the exact same creatinine level,
276.92	the concentration
276.92	in the blood of the patient,
280.72	automatically produces
280.72	a different GFR estimate
285.2	depending on whether or not
285.2	the patient is African-American.
291.12	Why?
293.28	I've been told it's based on an assumption
296.56	that African-Americans
296.56	have more muscle mass
299.68	than people of other races.
302.88	But what sense does it make
304.72	for a doctor to automatically assume
308.2	I have more muscle mass
308.2	than that female bodybuilder?
312.6	Wouldn't it be far more accurate
312.6	and evidence-based
316.6	to determine the muscle mass
316.6	of individual patients
320.64	just by looking at them?
324.36	Well, doctors tell me
324.36	they're using race as a shortcut.
327.8	It's a crude but convenient proxy
330.56	for more important factors,
330.56	like muscle mass,
333.84	enzyme level, genetic traits
336.24	they just don't have time to look for.
339.6	But race is a bad proxy.
342.4	In many cases, race adds
342.4	no relevant information at all.
346.56	It's just a distraction.
349.6	But race also tends to overwhelm
349.6	the clinical measures.
355.44	It blinds doctors to patients' symptoms,
359.76	family illnesses,
362.44	their history, their own illnesses
362.44	they might have --
366.8	all more evidence-based
366.8	than the patient's race.
371.92	Race can't substitute
371.92	for these important clinical measures
376.72	without sacrificing patient well-being.
381.8	Doctors also tell me
381.8	race is just one of many factors
385.48	they take into account,
387.04	but there are numerous medical tests,
389.2	like the GFR,
390.96	that use race categorically
394.24	to treat black, white,
394.24	Asian patients differently
398.24	just because of their race.
401.68	Race medicine also leaves
401.68	patients of color especially vulnerable
407.2	to harmful biases and stereotypes.
410.6	Black and Latino patients
410.6	are twice as likely
413.92	to receive no pain medication as whites
417.44	for the same painful long bone fractures
422.04	because of stereotypes
424.28	that black and brown people
424.28	feel less pain,
428.16	exaggerate their pain,
430.12	and are predisposed to drug addiction.
434.32	The Food and Drug Administration has even
434.32	approved a race-specific medicine.
440	It's a pill called BiDil
442.44	to treat heart failure in self-identified
442.44	African-American patients.
447.64	A cardiologist developed this drug
447.64	without regard to race or genetics,
453.84	but it became convenient
456.12	for commercial reasons
458.04	to market the drug to black patients.
462.36	The FDA then allowed
464.64	the company, the drug company,
467.72	to test the efficacy in a clinical trial
471.36	that only included
471.36	African-American subjects.
476.76	It speculated
478.56	that race stood in as a proxy
478.56	for some unknown genetic factor
484.68	that affects heart disease
487.48	or response to drugs.
491.56	But think about
491.56	the dangerous message it sent,
495.04	that black people's bodies
495.04	are so substandard,
499.52	a drug tested in them
501.24	is not guaranteed
501.24	to work in other patients.
506.84	In the end, the drug company's
506.84	marketing scheme failed.
510.68	For one thing, black patients
510.68	were understandably wary
514.68	of using a drug just for black people.
518.08	One elderly black woman stood up
518.08	in a community meeting and shouted,
522.04	"""Give me what the white"
522.04	"people are taking!"""
524.52	(Laughter)
527.559	And if you find race-specific
527.559	medicine surprising,
532.2	wait until you learn
534.159	that many doctors in the United States
537	still use an updated version
540.16	of a diagnostic tool
542.08	that was developed by a physician
542.08	during the slavery era,
546.56	a diagnostic tool that is tightly linked
549.88	to justifications for slavery.
553.56	Dr. Samuel Cartwright graduated
556.24	from the University
556.24	of Pennsylvania Medical School.
559.64	He practiced in the Deep South
559.64	before the Civil War,
563.24	and he was a well-known expert
563.24	"on what was then called ""Negro medicine."""
568.12	He promoted the racial concept of disease,
571.36	that people of different races
571.36	suffer from different diseases
575.08	and experience
575.08	common diseases differently.
579.88	Cartwright argued in the 1850s
583.16	that slavery was beneficial
583.16	for black people
587.2	for medical reasons.
589.28	He claimed that because black people
589.28	have lower lung capacity than whites,
594.2	forced labor was good for them.
597.84	He wrote in a medical journal,
600.12	"""It is the red vital blood"
600.12	sent to the brain
603.56	that liberates their minds
603.56	when under the white man's control,
607.92	and it is the want of sufficiency
607.92	of red vital blood
611.68	that chains their minds to ignorance
611.68	"and barbarism when in freedom."""
617.16	To support this theory,
617.16	Cartwright helped to perfect
620.32	a medical device for measuring breathing
620.32	called the spirometer
626.24	to show the presumed deficiency
626.24	in black people's lungs.
631.88	Today, doctors still
631.88	uphold Cartwright's claim
637.44	the black people as a race
640.08	have lower lung capacity
640.08	than white people.
644.28	Some even use a modern day spirometer
648.6	"that actually has a button labeled ""race"""
652.36	so the machine adjusts the measurement
655.04	for each patient
655.04	according to his or her race.
659.04	It's a well-known function
659.04	"called ""correcting for race."""
665.88	The problem with race medicine
665.88	extends far beyond misdiagnosing patients.
671.92	Its focus on innate
671.92	racial differences in disease
676.4	diverts attention and resources
679.52	from the social determinants
681.76	that cause appalling
681.76	racial gaps in health:
685.76	lack of access
685.76	to high-quality medical care;
689.56	food deserts in poor neighborhoods;
693.16	exposure to environmental toxins;
697	high rates of incarceration;
699.92	and experiencing the stress
699.92	of racial discrimination.
705.12	You see, race is not a biological category
708.92	that naturally produces
708.92	these health disparities
712.36	because of genetic difference.
715.24	Race is a social category
717.88	that has staggering
717.88	biological consequences,
721.56	but because of the impact
721.56	of social inequality on people's health.
727.16	Yet race medicine pretends
727.16	the answer to these gaps in health
731.32	can be found in a race-specific pill.
734.56	It's much easier and more lucrative
737.32	to market a technological fix
740.68	for these gaps in health
742.84	than to deal with the structural
742.84	inequities that produce them.
749.96	The reason I'm so passionate
749.96	about ending race medicine
754.32	isn't just because it's bad medicine.
757.4	I'm also on this mission
759.28	because the way doctors practice medicine
762.24	continues to promote
762.24	a false and toxic view of humanity.
768.84	Despite the many visionary breakthroughs
768.84	in medicine we've been learning about,
774.96	there's a failure of imagination
777.6	when it comes to race.
780.92	Would you imagine with me, just a moment:
784.6	What would happen if doctors
784.6	stopped treating patients by race?
792.36	Suppose they rejected
794.92	an 18th-century classification system
798.64	and incorporated instead
798.64	the most advanced knowledge
802.4	of human genetic diversity and unity,
805.36	that human beings cannot be categorized
805.36	into biological races?
812.6	What if, instead of using race
812.6	as a crude proxy
817.4	for some more important factor,
819.8	doctors actually investigated
819.8	and addressed that more important factor?
826.72	What if doctors joined the forefront
829.88	of a movement to end
829.88	the structural inequities
833.64	caused by racism,
835.88	not by genetic difference?
841.24	Race medicine is bad medicine,
845.16	it's poor science
847.32	and it's a false
847.32	interpretation of humanity.
851.52	It is more urgent than ever
854.12	to finally abandon this backward legacy
858.68	and to affirm our common humanity
862.12	by ending the social inequalities
862.12	that truly divide us.
868.04	Thank you.
869.28	(Applause)
871.52	Thank you. Thanks.
874.32	Thank you.
