13.267	Allow me to start this talk with a question to everyone.
17.795	You know that all over the world,
20.057	people fight for their freedom,
22.852	fight for their rights.
25.058	Some battle oppressive governments.
28.219	Others battle oppressive societies.
32.955	Which battle do you think is harder?
36.811	Allow me to try to answer this question
39.283	in the few coming minutes.
42.363	Let me take you back two years ago in my life.
48.179	It was the bedtime of my son, Aboody.
51.135	He was five at the time.
53.819	After finishing his bedtime rituals,
56.259	he looked at me and he asked a question:
60.341	"""Mommy, are we bad people?"""
63.572	I was shocked.
66.032	"""Why do you say such things, Aboody?"""
69.189	Earlier that day, I noticed some bruises
71.524	on his face when he came from school.
74.107	He wouldn't tell me what happened.
76.073	[But now] he was ready to tell.
80.136	"""Two boys hit me today in school."
82.947	They told me, 'We saw your mom on Facebook.
86.316	"You and your mom should be put in jail.'"""
91.102	I've never been afraid to tell Aboody anything.
94.243	I've been always a proud woman of my achievements.
98.947	But those questioning eyes of my son
101.162	were my moment of truth,
103.987	when it all came together.
107.74	You see, I'm a Saudi woman who had been put in jail
112.158	for driving a car in a country
114.293	where women are not supposed to drive cars.
119.248	Just for giving me his car keys,
121.639	my own brother was detained twice,
125.495	and he was harassed to the point he had
127.108	to quit his job as a geologist,
129.096	leave the country with his wife and two-year-old son.
132.43	My father had to sit in a Friday sermon
134.528	listening to the imam condemning women drivers
138.2	and calling them prostitutes
140.168	amongst tons of worshippers,
142.504	some of them our friends and family of my own father.
146.816	I was faced with an organized defamation campaign
150.4	in the local media combined with false rumors
153.382	shared in family gatherings, in the streets
156.24	and in schools.
158.984	It all hit me.
161.328	It came into focus that those kids
163.522	did not mean to be rude to my son.
165.816	They were just influenced by the adults around them.
169.886	And it wasn't about me, and it wasn't a punishment
173.355	for taking the wheel and driving a few miles.
177.169	It was a punishment for daring to challenge
180.018	the society's rules.
183.715	But my story goes beyond this moment of truth of mine.
188.252	Allow me to give you a briefing
192.048	about my story.
194.24	It was May, 2011,
196.276	and I was complaining to a work colleague
198.235	about the harassments I had to face
200.069	trying to find a ride back home,
201.857	although I have a car and an international driver's license.
205.341	As long as I've known, women in Saudi Arabia
207.466	have been always complaining about the ban,
209.952	but it's been 20 years since anyone
212.368	tried to do anything about it,
214.4	a whole generation ago.
216.6	He broke the good/bad news in my face.
218.736	"""But there is no law banning you from driving."""
221.893	I looked it up, and he was right.
224.097	There wasn't an actual law in Saudi Arabia.
226.776	It was just a custom and traditions
228.916	that are enshrined in rigid religious fatwas
232.932	and imposed on women.
234.936	That realization ignited the idea of June 17,
238.024	where we encouraged women to take the wheel
240.465	and go drive.
243.193	It was a few weeks later, we started receiving all these
247.048	"""Man wolves will rape you if you go and drive."""
250.254	A courageous woman, her name is Najla Hariri,
252.92	she's a Saudi woman in the city of Jeddah,
255.52	she drove a car and she announced
257.134	but she didn't record a video.
258.863	We needed proof.
260.723	So I drove. I posted a video on YouTube.
263.584	And to my surprise,
265.495	it got hundreds of thousands of views the first day.
268.384	What happened next, of course?
270.09	I started receiving threats
271.984	to be killed, raped, just to stop this campaign.
276.546	The Saudi authorities remained very quiet.
280.158	That really creeped us out.
282.338	I was in the campaign with other Saudi women
284.465	and even men activists.
286.418	We wanted to know how the authorities
288.882	would respond on the actual day, June 17,
292.49	when women go out and drive.
294.219	So this time I asked my brother
296.277	to come with me and drive by a police car.
298.368	It went fast. We were arrested,
301.122	signed a pledge not to drive again, released.
304.806	Arrested again, he was sent to detention for one day,
308.018	and I was sent to jail.
310.281	I wasn't sure why I was sent there,
311.906	because I didn't face any charges in the interrogation.
315.083	But what I was sure of was my innocence.
317.37	I didn't break a law, and I kept my abaya
319.835	— it's a black cloak we wear in Saudi Arabia before we leave the house —
323.711	and my fellow prisoners kept asking me to take it off,
326.693	but I was so sure of my innocence, I kept saying,
329.366	"""No, I'm leaving today."""
331.591	Outside the jail, the whole country went into a frenzy,
335.047	some attacking me badly,
337.351	and others supportive and even collecting signatures
341.076	in a petition to be sent to the king to release me.
345.319	I was released after nine days.
347.103	June 17 comes.
349.789	The streets were packed with police cars
352.479	and religious police cars,
354.64	but some hundred brave Saudi women
356.943	broke the ban and drove that day.
358.975	None were arrested. We broke the taboo.
362.063	(Applause)
372.407	So I think by now, everyone knows that we can't drive,
375.799	or women are not allowed to drive, in Saudi Arabia,
377.984	but maybe few know why.
380.282	Allow me to help you answer this question.
382.866	There was this official study
386.002	that was presented to the Shura Council --
388.046	it's the consultative council appointed
390.31	by the king in Saudi Arabia —
392.293	and it was done by a local professor,
394.334	a university professor.
395.652	He claims it's done based on a UNESCO study.
400.015	And the study states,
403.007	the percentage of rape, adultery,
406.799	illegitimate children, even drug abuse,
410.239	prostitution in countries where women drive
413.327	is higher than countries where women don't drive.
416.849	(Laughter)
418.186	I know, I was like this, I was shocked.
419.689	"I was like, ""We are the last country in the world"
422.809	"where women don't drive."""
424.762	So if you look at the map of the world,
426.928	that only leaves two countries:
428.621	Saudi Arabia, and the other society is the rest of the world.
433.007	We started a hashtag on Twitter mocking the study,
436.095	and it made headlines around the world.
438.563	[BBC News: 'End of virginity' if women drive, Saudi cleric warns]
440.327	(Laughter)
441.592	And only then we realized it's so empowering
444.263	to mock your oppressor.
445.727	It strips it away of its strongest weapon: fear.
450.226	This system is based on ultra-conservative
453.83	traditions and customs
455.737	that deal with women as if they are inferior
458.984	and they need a guardian to protect them,
461.481	so they need to take permission from this guardian,
463.685	whether verbal or written, all their lives.
465.851	We are minors until the day we die.
468.307	And it becomes worse when it's enshrined in religious fatwas
472.213	based on wrong interpretation of the sharia law,
474.915	or the religious laws.
477.105	What's worst, when they become codified
479.23	as laws in the system,
481.681	and when women themselves believe in their inferiority,
485.077	and they even fight those who try
487.567	to question these rules.
491.137	So for me, it wasn't only about these attacks I had to face.
495.403	It was about living two totally different
498.217	perceptions of my personality, of my person --
501.177	the villain back in my home country,
503.889	and the hero outside.
505.912	Just to tell you, two stories happened in the last two years.
509.987	One of them is when I was in jail.
512.365	I'm pretty sure when I was in jail,
514.023	everyone saw titles in the international media
518.474	something like this during these nine days I was in jail.
522.519	But in my home country, it was a totally different picture.
525.996	It was more like this:
527.665	"""Manal al-Sharif faces charges of disturbing public order"
530.697	"and inciting women to drive."""
534.439	I know.
537.473	"""Manal al-Sharif withdraws from the campaign."""
539.522	Ah, it's okay. This is my favorite.
542.089	"""Manal al-Sharif breaks down and confesses:"
544.486	"'Foreign forces incited me.'"""
546.298	(Laughter)
548.657	And it goes on, even trial and flogging me in public.
553.854	So it's a totally different picture.
557.282	I was asked last year to give a speech
559.054	at the Oslo Freedom Forum.
561.666	I was surrounded by this love
564.251	and the support of people around me,
566.386	and they looked at me as an inspiration.
568.571	At the same time, I flew back to my home country,
571.433	they hated that speech so much.
573.358	The way they called it: a betrayal to the Saudi country
575.897	and the Saudi people,
577.489	and they even started a hashtag called #OsloTraitor on Twitter.
580.85	Some 10,000 tweets were written in that hashtag,
584.119	while the opposite hashtag, #OsloHero,
586.937	there was like a handful of tweets written.
588.721	They even started a poll.
590.661	More than 13,000 voters answered this poll:
593.944	whether they considered me a traitor or not after that speech.
596.97	Ninety percent said yes, she's a traitor.
599.996	So it's these two totally different perceptions
603.886	of my personality.
605.493	For me, I'm a proud Saudi woman,
607.517	and I do love my country,
609.116	and because I love my country, I'm doing this.
612.045	Because I believe a society will not be free
614.91	if the women of that society are not free.
617.453	(Applause)
627.382	Thank you.
629.734	(Applause)
632.55	Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
635.174	(Applause)
647.938	Thank you.
651.615	But you learn lessons from these things that happen to you.
655.836	I learned to be always there.
658.054	The first thing, I got out of jail,
660.292	of course after I took a shower, I went online,
663.612	I opened my Twitter account and my Facebook page,
666.831	and I've been always very respectful
669.119	to those people who are opining to me.
670.626	I would listen to what they say,
672.226	and I would never defend myself with words only.
675.159	I would use actions. When they said I should withdraw from the campaign,
677.567	I filed the first lawsuit against the general directorate
680.725	of traffic police for not issuing me a driver's license.
684.967	There are a lot of people also --
686.942	very big support, like those 3,000 people
689.247	who signed the petition to release me.
691.611	We sent a petition to the Shura Council
694.815	in favor of lifting the ban on Saudi women,
698.047	and there were, like, 3,500 citizens who believed in that
701.256	and they signed that petition.
702.889	There were people like that, I just showed some examples,
705.76	who are amazing, who are believing in women's rights in Saudi Arabia,
708.872	and trying, and they are also facing a lot of hate
711.6	because of speaking up and voicing their views.
715.408	Saudi Arabia today is taking small steps
717.785	toward enhancing women's rights.
719.994	The Shura Council that's appointed by the king,
722.192	by royal decree of King Abdullah,
724.546	last year there were 30 women assigned to that Council,
728.154	like 20 percent.
733.41	The same time, finally, that Council,
735.57	after rejecting our petition four times for women driving,
738.562	they finally accepted it last February.
741.137	(Applause)
746.127	After being sent to jail
747.964	or sentenced lashing, or sent to a trial,
750.817	the spokesperson of the traffic police said,
752.906	we will only issue traffic violation for women drivers.
757.217	The Grand Mufti, who is the head
758.655	of the religious establishment in Saudi Arabia,
761.431	he said, it's not recommended for women to drive.
765.543	It used to be haram, forbidden, by the previous Grand Mufti.
770.073	So for me, it's not about only these small steps.
775.622	It's about women themselves.
777.187	A friend once asked me, she said,
778.839	"""So when do you think this women driving will happen?"""
781.59	"I told her, ""Only if women stop asking 'When?'"
784.339	"and take action to make it now."""
787.113	So it's not only about the system,
788.767	it's also about us women to drive our own life, I'd say.
795.21	So I have no clue, really, how I became an activist.
801.362	And I don't know how I became one now.
805.329	But all I know, and all I'm sure of, in the future
808.977	when someone asks me my story,
811.745	"I will say, ""I'm proud"
813.977	to be amongst those women who lifted the ban,
816.833	"fought the ban, and celebrated everyone's freedom."""
820.608	So the question I started my talk with,
823.905	who do you think is more difficult to face,
827.105	oppressive governments or oppressive societies?
830.062	I hope you find clues to answer that from my speech.
832.961	Thank you, everyone.
834.417	(Applause)
839.185	Thank you.
842.309	(Applause)
847.993	Thank you. (Applause)
