12.683	It was November 1, 2002,
18.208	my first day as a principal,
21.677	but hardly my first day
21.677	in the school district of Philadelphia.
27.218	I graduated from
27.218	Philadelphia public schools,
30.625	and I went on to teach
30.625	special education for 20 years
34.792	in a low-income, low-performing school
38.167	in North Philadelphia,
40.292	where crime is rampant
42.333	and deep poverty is
42.333	among the highest in the nation.
46.958	Shortly after I walked into my new school,
50.583	a huge fight broke out among the girls.
56.083	After things were quickly under control,
59.5	I immediately called a meeting
62.542	in the school's auditorium
64.833	to introduce myself
64.833	as the school's new principal.
68.792	(Applause)
72.458	I walked in angry,
75.154	a little nervous --
76.546	(Laughter) --
77.708	but I was determined
79.792	to set the tone for my new students.
83.083	I started listing as forcefully as I could
86.958	my expectations for their behavior
90.125	and my expectations
90.125	for what they would learn in school.
94.625	When, all of a sudden,
97.042	a girl way in the back of the auditorium,
100.75	she stood up
102.875	"and she said, ""Miss!"
105.625	"Miss!"""
107.75	When our eyes locked, she said,
112.25	"""Why do you keep calling this a school?"
116.708	"This is not a school."""
120.625	In one outburst,
123.125	Ashley had expressed what I felt
127.167	and never quite was able to articulate
130.292	about my own experience
130.292	when I attended a low-performing school
134.917	in the same neighborhood,
134.917	many, many, many years earlier.
139.5	That school was definitely not a school.
145	Fast forwarding a decade later to 2012,
151.083	I was entering my third
151.083	low-performing school as principal.
156.667	I was to be Strawberry Mansion's
156.667	fourth principal in four years.
162.75	"It was labeled ""low-performing"
162.75	"and persistently dangerous"""
167.708	due to its low test scores
170.625	and high number of weapons,
173.375	drugs, assaults and arrests.
177.833	Shortly as I approached the door
177.833	of my new school
181.75	and attempted to enter,
183.542	and found the door locked with chains,
187.458	I could hear Ashley's voice in my ears
190.875	"going, ""Miss! Miss!"
194.833	"This is not a school."""
197.792	The halls were dim and dark
197.792	from poor lighting.
201.708	There were tons of piles
201.708	of broken old furniture
205.042	and desks in the classrooms,
207.333	and there were thousands
207.333	of unused materials and resources.
212.625	This was not a school.
216.292	As the year progressed,
218.75	I noticed that the classrooms
218.75	were nearly empty.
223.958	The students were just scared:
226.75	scared to sit in rows in fear
226.75	that something would happen;
231.583	scared because they were often teased
231.583	in the cafeteria for eating free food.
236.792	They were scared from all the fighting
236.792	and all the bullying.
241.792	This was not a school.
247.375	And then, there were the teachers,
250.125	who were incredibly afraid
250.125	for their own safety,
254.833	so they had low expectations
254.833	for the students and themselves,
260.5	and they were totally
260.5	unaware of their role
263.833	in the destruction
263.833	of the school's culture.
266.5	This was the most troubling of all.
270.791	You see, Ashley was right,
274.833	and not just about her school.
277.667	For far too many schools,
279.833	for kids who live in poverty,
281.917	their schools are really
281.917	not schools at all.
285.583	But this can change.
287.958	Let me tell you how it's being done
287.958	at Strawberry Mansion High School.
294.083	Anybody who's ever worked
294.083	with me will tell you
297.917	I am known for my slogans.
300.583	(Laughter)
302	So today, I am going to use three
305.554	that have been paramount
305.554	in our quest for change.
309.917	My first slogan is:
312.458	if you're going to lead, lead.
315.75	I always believed
317.894	that what happens in a school
317.894	and what does not happen in a school
321.792	is up to the principal.
323.958	I am the principal,
325.833	and having that title required me to lead.
330.125	I was not going to stay in my office,
332.846	I was not going to delegate my work,
335.691	and I was not going to be afraid
335.691	to address anything
339.16	that was not good for children,
341.084	whether that made me liked or not.
345.228	I am a leader,
346.965	so I know I cannot do anything alone.
350.788	So, I assembled
350.788	a top-notch leadership team
353.475	who believed in the possibility
353.475	of all the children,
356.583	and together, we tackled the small things,
360.456	like resetting every single
360.456	locker combination by hand
365.083	so that every student
365.083	could have a secure locker.
368.583	We decorated every
368.583	bulletin board in that building
372.039	with bright, colorful,
372.039	and positive messages.
375.428	We took the chains off
375.428	the front doors of the school.
378.579	We got the lightbulbs replaced,
380.698	and we cleaned
380.698	every classroom to its core,
383.878	recycling every, every textbook
383.878	that was not needed,
388.377	and discarded thousands
388.377	of old materials and furniture.
392.692	We used two dumpsters per day.
396.875	And, of course, of course,
399.456	we tackled the big stuff,
401.857	like rehauling the entire school budget
405.803	so that we can reallocate funds
405.803	to have more teachers and support staff.
411.733	We rebuilt the entire
411.733	school day schedule from scratch
417.292	to add a variety of start and end times,
421.195	remediation, honors courses,
424.792	extracurricular activities,
424.792	and counseling,
428.416	all during the school day.
431.717	All during the school day.
436.217	We created a deployment plan
440.473	that specified where every single
440.473	support person and police officer would be
446.145	every minute of the day,
447.573	and we monitored
447.573	at every second of the day,
451.5	and, our best invention ever,
454.299	we devised a schoolwide
454.299	discipline program
457.957	"titled ""Non-negotiables."""
460.137	It was a behavior system --
464.368	designed to promote
464.368	positive behavior at all times.
469.131	The results?
471.085	Strawberry Mansion was removed
471.085	from the Persistently Dangerous List
475.237	our first year after being --
477.7	(Applause) --
483.8	after being on the Persistently
483.8	Dangerous List for five consecutive years.
488.732	Leaders make the impossible possible.
493.939	That brings me to my second slogan:
496.865	So what? Now what?
499.491	(Laughter)
500.597	(Applause)
505.483	When we looked at the data,
507.718	and we met with the staff,
509.812	there were many excuses
511.75	for why Strawberry Mansion was
511.75	low-performing and persistently dangerous.
516.129	They said that only 68 percent of the kids
516.129	come to school on a regular basis,
524.587	only one percent
524.587	of the parents participate,
528.173	many of the children
529.828	come from incarceration
529.828	and single-parent homes,
	have special needs,
537.728	and the state data revealed
540.695	that six percent of the students
540.695	were proficient in algebra,
545.017	and 10 were proficient in literature.
550.817	After they got through
550.817	telling us all the stories
554.767	of how awful the conditions
554.767	and the children were,
558.75	I looked at them,
561.162	"and I said, ""So what. Now what?"
565.088	"What are we gonna do about it?"""
566.915	(Applause)
572.654	Eliminating excuses at every turn
572.654	became my primary responsibility.
578.552	We addressed every one of those excuses
581.614	through a mandatory
581.614	professional development,
584.194	paving the way for intense focus
584.194	on teaching and learning.
590.037	After many observations,
592.18	what we determined was
592.18	that teachers knew what to teach
597.462	but they did not know how to teach
600.25	so many children
600.25	with so many vast abilities.
603.798	So, we developed a lesson
603.798	delivery model for instruction
608.896	that focused on small group instruction,
612.66	making it possible for all the students
612.66	to get their individual needs met
617.478	in the classroom.
619.17	The results?
621.149	After one year, state data revealed
625.826	that our scores have grown
625.826	by 171 percent in Algebra
630.161	and 107 percent in literature.
632.806	(Applause)
637.3	We have a very long way to go,
640.049	a very long way to go,
642.625	but we now approach every obstacle
642.625	"with a ""So What. Now What?"" attitude."
650.377	And that brings me
650.377	to my third and final slogan.
654.486	(Laughter)
656.16	If nobody told you they loved you today,
660.678	you remember I do, and I always will.
665.079	My students have problems:
667.875	social, emotional and economic problems
672.448	you could never imagine.
675.056	Some of them are parents themselves,
677.418	and some are completely alone.
681.375	If someone asked me my real secret
684.917	for how I truly keep
684.917	Strawberry Mansion moving forward,
689.405	I would have to say
689.405	that I love my students
692.935	and I believe in their possibilities
695.427	unconditionally.
698	When I look at them,
700.235	I can only see what they can become,
703.869	and that is because I am one of them.
708.542	I grew up poor in North Philadelphia too.
712.261	I know what it feels like
712.261	to go to a school that's not a school.
718.184	I know what it feels like to wonder
721.458	if there's ever going to be
721.458	any way out of poverty.
726.092	But because of my amazing mother,
730.496	I got the ability to dream
733.586	despite the poverty that surrounded me.
737.161	So --
738.383	(Applause) --
740.855	if I'm going to push my students
745.972	toward their dream
745.972	and their purpose in life,
748.769	I've got to get to know who they are.
752.042	So I have to spend time with them,
754.918	so I manage the lunchroom every day.
757.342	(Laughter)
758.655	And while I'm there,
760.896	I talk to them
760.896	about deeply personal things,
765.83	and when it's their birthday,
767.937	"I sing ""Happy Birthday"""
769.89	even though I cannot sing at all.
772.06	(Laughter)
774.116	I often ask them,
775.864	"""Why do you want me to sing"
775.864	"when I cannot sing at all?"""
779.821	(Laughter)
781.683	And they respond by saying,
784.284	"""Because we like feeling special."""
788.259	We hold monthly town hall meetings
791.611	to listen to their concerns,
794.565	to find out what is on their minds.
798.784	They ask us questions like,
798.784	"""Why do we have to follow rules?"""
804.255	"""Why are there so many consequences?"""
807.168	"""Why can't we just do what we want to do?"""
810.159	(Laughter)
812.414	They ask, and I answer
812.414	each question honestly,
816.932	and this exchange in listening
816.932	helps to clear up any misconceptions.
823.86	Every moment is a teachable moment.
828.965	My reward,
831.359	my reward
834.759	for being non-negotiable
834.759	in my rules and consequences
839.839	is their earned respect.
842.564	I insist on it,
844.878	and because of this,
844.878	we can accomplish things together.
849.952	They are clear about
849.952	my expectations for them,
854	and I repeat those expectations
854	every day over the P.A. system.
859.656	I remind them --
861.293	(Laughter)
863.533	I remind them of those core values
867.19	of focus, tradition, excellence,
872.172	integrity and perseverance,
875.133	and I remind them every day
877.655	how education can truly
877.655	change their lives.
882.216	And I end every announcement the same:
885.414	"""If nobody told you they loved you today,"
889.291	you remember I do,
891.056	"and I always will."""
894.076	Ashley's words
896.893	"of ""Miss, Miss,"
900.224	"this is not a school,"""
903.064	is forever etched in my mind.
906.354	If we are truly going
906.354	to make real progress
911.806	in addressing poverty,
913.798	then we have to make sure
916.442	that every school
916.442	that serves children in poverty
920.655	is a real school,
923.284	a school, a school --
925.563	(Applause) --
929.458	a school that provides them with knowledge
933.264	and mental training
933.264	to navigate the world around them.
938.112	I do not know all the answers,
941.458	but what I do know is for those
941.458	of us who are privileged
947.5	and have the responsibility of leading
947.5	a school that serves children in poverty,
953.042	we must truly lead,
955.292	and when we are faced
955.292	with unbelievable challenges,
958.941	we must stop and ask ourselves,
958.941	"""So what. Now what?"
964.75	"What are we going to do about it?"""
968.06	And as we lead,
970.063	we must never forget
972.677	that every single one of our students
975.917	is just a child,
977.99	often scared by what the world
977.99	tells them they should be,
983.797	and no matter what the rest
983.797	of the world tells them they should be,
990.139	we should always provide them with hope,
993.438	our undivided attention,
996.656	unwavering belief in their potential,
999.806	consistent expectations,
1002.303	and we must tell them often,
1005.117	if nobody told them they loved them today,
1008.717	remember we do, and we always will.
1011.844	Thank you.
1013.081	(Applause)
1024.058	Thank you, Jesus.
