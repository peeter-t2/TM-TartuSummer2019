12.88	When I was 27 years old,
14.954	I left a very demanding job
14.954	in management consulting
18.301	for a job that was even more
18.301	demanding: teaching.
23.298	I went to teach seventh graders math
25.802	in the New York City public schools.
28.202	And like any teacher,
28.202	I made quizzes and tests.
31.107	I gave out homework assignments.
33.107	When the work came back,
33.107	I calculated grades.
36.758	What struck me was that IQ
36.758	was not the only difference
41.334	between my best and my worst students.
45.017	Some of my strongest performers
45.017	did not have stratospheric IQ scores.
50.345	Some of my smartest kids
50.345	weren't doing so well.
54.297	And that got me thinking.
56.432	The kinds of things you need
56.432	to learn in seventh grade math,
59.416	sure, they're hard: ratios, decimals,
59.416	the area of a parallelogram.
64.668	But these concepts are not impossible,
67.368	and I was firmly convinced
67.368	that every one of my students
71.502	could learn the material
74.106	if they worked hard and long enough.
76.842	After several more years of teaching,
79.328	I came to the conclusion
79.328	that what we need in education
83.086	is a much better understanding
83.086	of students and learning
86.57	from a motivational perspective,
88.911	from a psychological perspective.
91.815	In education, the one thing
91.815	we know how to measure best is IQ.
98.172	But what if doing
98.172	well in school and in life
102.048	depends on much more
104.166	than your ability to learn
104.166	quickly and easily?
108.371	So I left the classroom,
110.321	and I went to graduate school
110.321	to become a psychologist.
113.877	I started studying kids and adults
116.051	in all kinds of super
116.051	challenging settings,
118.908	and in every study my question was,
121.36	who is successful here and why?
124.384	My research team and I went
124.384	to West Point Military Academy.
128.476	We tried to predict which cadets
130.16	would stay in military training
130.16	and which would drop out.
134.414	We went to the National Spelling Bee
136.669	and tried to predict which children
136.669	would advance farthest in competition.
141.867	We studied rookie teachers
141.867	working in really tough neighborhoods,
145.947	asking which teachers are still
145.947	going to be here in teaching
149.388	by the end of the school year,
151.406	and of those, who will be
151.406	the most effective
154.441	at improving learning
154.441	outcomes for their students?
157.592	We partnered with private
157.592	companies, asking,
159.846	which of these salespeople
159.846	is going to keep their jobs?
162.565	And who's going to earn the most money?
164.797	In all those very different contexts,
167.479	one characteristic emerged
167.479	as a significant predictor of success.
172.464	And it wasn't social intelligence.
174.662	It wasn't good looks, physical health,
177.671	and it wasn't IQ.
179.758	It was grit.
181.899	Grit is passion and perseverance
181.899	for very long-term goals.
186.989	Grit is having stamina.
189.232	Grit is sticking with your future,
189.232	day in, day out,
193.462	not just for the week,
193.462	not just for the month,
196.851	but for years,
198.407	and working really hard
198.407	to make that future a reality.
202.969	Grit is living life
202.969	like it's a marathon, not a sprint.
208.156	A few years ago,
209.611	I started studying grit
209.611	in the Chicago public schools.
213.141	I asked thousands of high school juniors
215.453	to take grit questionnaires,
217.305	and then waited around more than a year
219.281	to see who would graduate.
221.518	Turns out that grittier kids
223.764	were significantly more
223.764	likely to graduate,
226.968	even when I matched them
226.968	on every characteristic I could measure,
230.754	things like family income,
233.028	standardized achievement test scores,
235.774	even how safe kids felt
235.774	when they were at school.
239.377	So it's not just at West Point
239.377	or the National Spelling Bee
242.338	that grit matters.
243.476	It's also in school,
245.441	especially for kids
245.441	at risk for dropping out.
249.116	To me, the most shocking thing about grit
252.098	is how little we know,
254.081	how little science knows,
254.081	about building it.
257.003	Every day, parents and teachers ask me,
259.278	"""How do I build grit in kids?"
261.502	What do I do to teach kids
261.502	a solid work ethic?
264.753	How do I keep them motivated
264.753	"for the long run?"""
267.86	The honest answer is,
269.859	I don't know.
270.96	(Laughter)
272.459	What I do know is that talent
272.459	doesn't make you gritty.
275.522	Our data show very clearly
277.877	that there are many talented individuals
280.314	who simply do not follow through
280.314	on their commitments.
283.814	In fact, in our data,
283.814	grit is usually unrelated
288.052	or even inversely related
288.052	to measures of talent.
292.465	So far, the best idea I've heard
292.465	about building grit in kids
296.584	"is something called ""growth mindset."""
299.449	This is an idea developed
299.449	at Stanford University by Carol Dweck,
303.143	and it is the belief that the ability
303.143	to learn is not fixed,
308.265	that it can change with your effort.
311.44	Dr. Dweck has shown
312.783	that when kids read
312.783	and learn about the brain
315.942	and how it changes and grows
315.942	in response to challenge,
319.44	they're much more likely
319.44	to persevere when they fail,
323.461	because they don't believe that failure
323.461	is a permanent condition.
329.052	So growth mindset
329.052	is a great idea for building grit.
332.724	But we need more.
334.825	And that's where I'm going
334.825	to end my remarks,
336.945	because that's where we are.
338.315	That's the work that stands before us.
340.504	We need to take our best ideas,
340.504	our strongest intuitions,
344.408	and we need to test them.
346.512	We need to measure
346.512	whether we've been successful,
349.247	and we have to be willing
349.247	to fail, to be wrong,
352.977	to start over again with lessons learned.
356.336	In other words, we need to be gritty
359.304	about getting our kids grittier.
362.177	Thank you.
363.233	(Applause)
