12.88	So, this is a story
14.904	about how we know what we know.
17.69	It's a story about this woman,
20.611	Natalia Rybczynski.
22.912	She's a paleobiologist,
24.984	which means she specializes
24.984	in digging up really old dead stuff.
28.837	(Audio) Natalia Rybczynski: Yeah,
28.837	"I had someone call me ""Dr. Dead Things."""
32.363	Latif Nasser: And I think
32.363	she's particularly interesting
35.016	because of where she digs that stuff up,
36.954	way above the Arctic Circle
36.954	in the remote Canadian tundra.
41.901	Now, one summer day in 2006,
44.98	she was at a dig site called
44.98	the Fyles Leaf Bed,
48.195	which is less than 10 degrees latitude
48.195	away from the magnetic north pole.
52.797	(Audio) NR: Really, it's not
52.797	going to sound very exciting,
55.548	because it was a day of walking
55.548	with your backpack and your GPS
59.602	and notebook and just picking up
59.602	anything that might be a fossil.
63.704	LN: And at some point,
63.704	she noticed something.
66.403	(Audio) NR: Rusty, kind of rust-colored,
68.594	about the size of the palm of my hand.
70.553	It was just lying on the surface.
72.871	LN: And at first she thought
72.871	it was just a splinter of wood,
76.347	because that's the sort of thing
76.347	people had found
78.664	at the Fyles Leaf Bed before --
78.664	prehistoric plant parts.
82.107	But that night, back at camp ...
84.94	(Audio) NR: ... I get out the hand lens,
86.893	I'm looking a little bit
86.893	more closely and realizing
89.314	it doesn't quite look
89.314	like this has tree rings.
91.742	Maybe it's a preservation thing,
93.33	but it looks really like ...
95.628	bone.
96.853	LN: Huh. So over the next four years,
99.766	she went to that spot over and over,
102.724	and eventually collected 30 fragments
102.724	of that exact same bone,
108.284	most of them really tiny.
110.522	(Audio) NR: It's not a whole lot.
110.522	It fits in a small Ziploc bag.
114.982	LN: And she tried to piece them
114.982	together like a jigsaw puzzle.
118.941	But it was challenging.
120.41	(Audio) NR: It's broken up
120.41	into so many little tiny pieces,
123.254	I'm trying to use sand and putty,
123.254	and it's not looking good.
127.536	So finally, we used a 3D surface scanner.
132.727	LN: Ooh!
132.727	NR: Yeah, right?
134.34	(Laughter)
135.804	LN: It turns out it was way easier
135.804	to do it virtually.
138.571	(Audio) NR: It's kind of magical
138.571	when it all fits together.
141.365	LN: How certain were you
141.365	that you had it right,
143.588	that you had put it together
143.588	in the right way?
145.757	Was there a potential that you'd
145.757	put it together a different way
148.795	and have, like, a parakeet or something?
150.761	(Laughter)
152.15	(Audio) NR: (Laughs) Um, no.
152.15	No, we got this.
156.242	LN: What she had, she discovered,
156.242	was a tibia, a leg bone,
160.107	and specifically, one that belonged
160.107	to a cloven-hoofed mammal,
164.131	so something like a cow or a sheep.
167.004	But it couldn't have been either of those.
169.488	It was just too big.
171.822	(Audio) NR: The size of this thing,
171.822	it was huge. It's a really big animal.
175.91	LN: So what animal could it be?
179.291	Having hit a wall, she showed
179.291	one of the fragments
181.895	to some colleagues of hers in Colorado,
184.491	and they had an idea.
186.244	(Audio) NR: We took a saw,
186.244	and we nicked just the edge of it,
191.315	and there was this really interesting
191.315	smell that comes from it.
198.521	LN: It smelled kind of like singed flesh.
201.308	It was a smell that Natalia recognized
203.965	from cutting up skulls
203.965	in her gross anatomy lab:
207.932	collagen.
209.12	Collagen is what gives
209.12	structure to our bones.
211.801	And usually, after so many years,
213.983	it breaks down.
215.158	But in this case, the Arctic had acted
215.158	like a natural freezer and preserved it.
220.19	Then a year or two later,
220.19	Natalia was at a conference in Bristol,
223.837	and she saw that a colleague
223.837	of hers named Mike Buckley
227.055	was demoing this new process
227.055	"that he called ""collagen fingerprinting."""
233.284	It turns out that different species
233.284	have slightly different structures
236.951	of collagen,
238.127	so if you get a collagen profile
238.127	of an unknown bone,
240.967	you can compare it
240.967	to those of known species,
243.185	and, who knows, maybe you get a match.
246.546	So she shipped him one of the fragments,
249.849	FedEx.
251.167	(Audio) NR: Yeah, you want to track it.
251.167	It's kind of important.
255.001	(Laughter)
256.278	LN: And he processed it,
257.493	and compared it to 37 known
257.493	and modern-day mammal species.
262.674	And he found a match.
264.824	It turns out that
264.824	the 3.5 million-year-old bone
269.46	that Natalia had dug
269.46	out of the High Arctic
273.729	belonged to ...
276.031	a camel.
277.372	(Laughter)
279.127	(Audio) NR: And I'm thinking, what?
279.127	That's amazing -- if it's true.
283.449	LN: So they tested
283.449	a bunch of the fragments,
285.525	and they got the same result for each one.
288.197	However, based on the size
288.197	of the bone that they found,
293.641	it meant that this camel was 30 percent
293.641	larger than modern-day camels.
300.028	So this camel would have been
300.028	about nine feet tall,
303.242	weighed around a ton.
304.464	(Audience reacts)
305.539	Yeah.
306.612	Natalia had found a Giant Arctic camel.
310.129	(Laughter)
314.396	"Now, when you hear the word ""camel,"""
316.738	what may come to mind is one of these,
321.507	the Bactrian camel
321.507	of East and Central Asia.
324.895	But chances are the postcard image
324.895	you have in your brain
328.404	is one of these, the dromedary,
331.983	quintessential desert creature --
334.435	hangs out in sandy, hot places
334.435	like the Middle East and the Sahara,
338.778	has a big old hump on its back
340.282	for storing water
340.282	for those long desert treks,
342.823	has big, broad feet to help it
342.823	tromp over sand dunes.
346.918	So how on earth would one of these guys
346.918	end up in the High Arctic?
353.719	Well, scientists have known
353.719	for a long time, turns out,
356.53	even before Natalia's discovery,
359.116	that camels are actually
359.116	originally American.
364.758	(Music: The Star-Spangled Banner)
370.482	(Laughter)
371.965	They started here.
373.52	For nearly 40 of the 45 million years
373.52	that camels have been around,
378.378	you could only find them in North America,
381.561	around 20 different species, maybe more.
384.838	(Audio) LN: If I put them all in a lineup,
384.838	would they look different?
388.107	NR: Yeah, you're going to have
388.107	different body sizes.
390.566	You'll have some with really long necks,
392.502	so they're actually
392.502	functionally like giraffes.
395.345	LN: Some had snouts, like crocodiles.
398.441	(Audio) NR: The really primitive,
398.441	early ones would have been really small,
402.049	almost like rabbits.
404.576	LN: What? Rabbit-sized camels?
407.447	(Audio) NR: The earliest ones.
408.908	So those ones you probably
408.908	would not recognize.
411.167	LN: Oh my God, I want a pet rabbit-camel.
413.381	(Audio) NR: I know,
413.381	wouldn't that be great?
415.449	(Laughter)
416.645	LN: And then about three
416.645	to seven million years ago,
419.328	one branch of camels
419.328	went down to South America,
422.16	where they became llamas and alpacas,
425.138	and another branch crossed over
425.138	the Bering Land Bridge
428.084	into Asia and Africa.
429.544	And then around the end
429.544	of the last ice age,
431.989	North American camels went extinct.
435.893	So, scientists knew all of that already,
438.337	but it still doesn't fully explain
438.337	how Natalia found one so far north.
444.437	Like, this is, temperature-wise,
444.437	the polar opposite of the Sahara.
449.135	Now to be fair,
451.66	three and a half million years ago,
453.367	it was on average 22 degrees Celsius
453.367	warmer than it is now.
457.49	So it would have been boreal forest,
460.449	so more like the Yukon or Siberia today.
464.853	But still, like, they would have
464.853	six-month-long winters
468.583	where the ponds would freeze over.
470.83	You'd have blizzards.
472.322	You'd have 24 hours a day
472.322	of straight darkness.
475.957	Like, how ... How?
478.962	How is it that one of these
478.962	Saharan superstars
483.144	could ever have survived
483.144	those arctic conditions?
486.399	(Laughter)
489.399	Natalia and her colleagues
489.399	think they have an answer.
493.632	And it's kind of brilliant.
496.7	What if the very features that we imagine
496.7	make the camel so well-suited
503.257	to places like the Sahara,
505.249	actually evolved to help it
505.249	get through the winter?
509.448	What if those broad feet were meant
509.448	to tromp not over sand,
514.169	but over snow, like a pair of snowshoes?
517.792	What if that hump --
517.792	which, huge news to me,
520.617	does not contain water, it contains fat --
523.015	(Laughter)
524.618	was there to help the camel
524.618	get through that six-month-long winter,
528.243	when food was scarce?
529.944	And then, only later, long after
529.944	it crossed over the land bridge
533.681	did it retrofit those winter features
533.681	for a hot desert environment?
538.123	Like, for instance, the hump
538.123	may be helpful to camels in hotter climes
542.221	because having all your fat in one place,
544.717	like a, you know, fat backpack,
547.482	means that you don't have
547.482	to have that insulation
550.034	all over the rest of your body.
551.817	So it helps heat dissipate easier.
554.555	It's this crazy idea,
557.42	that what seems like proof of the camel's
557.42	quintessential desert nature
562.991	could actually be proof
562.991	of its High Arctic past.
567.832	Now, I'm not the first person
567.832	to tell this story.
571.566	Others have told it as a way
571.566	to marvel at evolutionary biology
576.54	or as a keyhole into the future
576.54	of climate change.
580.855	But I love it for a totally
580.855	different reason.
583.751	For me, it's a story about us,
586.537	about how we see the world
588.529	and about how that changes.
591.658	So I was trained as a historian.
595.054	And I've learned that, actually,
595.054	a lot of scientists are historians, too.
599.331	They make sense of the past.
600.904	They tell the history of our universe,
600.904	of our planet, of life on this planet.
606.741	And as a historian,
608.242	you start with an idea in your mind
608.242	of how the story goes.
613.196	(Audio) NR: We make up stories
613.196	and we stick with it,
615.705	like the camel in the desert, right?
617.451	That's a great story!
617.451	It's totally adapted for that.
619.921	Clearly, it always lived there.
622.174	LN: But at any moment, you could
622.174	uncover some tiny bit of evidence.
626.5	You could learn some tiny thing
628.723	that forces you to reframe
628.723	everything you thought you knew.
632.706	Like, in this case, this one scientist
632.706	finds this one shard
636.508	of what she thought was wood,
638.279	and because of that, science has a totally
638.279	new and totally counterintuitive theory
643.341	about why this absurd
643.341	Dr. Seuss-looking creature
646.98	looks the way it does.
648.536	And for me, it completely upended
648.536	the way I think of the camel.
653.964	It went from being
653.964	this ridiculously niche creature
658.37	suited only to this
658.37	one specific environment,
660.743	to being this world traveler
660.743	that just happens to be in the Sahara,
666.055	and could end up virtually anywhere.
669.88	(Applause)
686.396	This is Azuri.
688.589	Azuri, hi, how are you doing?
691.493	OK, here, I've got
691.493	one of these for you here.
694.065	(Laughter)
696.135	So Azuri is on a break
696.135	from her regular gig
700.342	at the Radio City Music Hall.
702.589	(Laughter)
704.762	That's not even a joke.
706.717	Anyway --
708.478	But really, Azuri is here
708.478	as a living reminder
712.859	that the story of our world
712.859	is a dynamic one.
717.13	It requires our willingness
717.13	to readjust, to reimagine.
721.861	(Laughter)
726.162	Right, Azuri?
727.637	And, really, that we're all
727.637	just one shard of bone away
734.077	from seeing the world anew.
736.926	Thank you very much.
738.11	(Applause)
