12.998	Why does the universe exist?
15.001	Why is there — Okay. Okay. (Laughter)
18.996	This is a cosmic mystery. Be solemn.
21.838	Why is there a world, why are we in it,
25.414	and why is there something rather than nothing at all?
27.293	"I mean, this is the super ultimate ""why"" question?"
31.939	So I'm going to talk about the mystery of existence,
34.174	the puzzle of existence,
35.73	where we are now in addressing it,
38.644	and why you should care,
40.894	and I hope you do care.
42.81	The philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer said that
45.636	those who don't wonder about
45.636	the contingency of their existence,
49.416	of the contingency of the world's existence,
52.273	are mentally deficient.
53.936	That's a little harsh, but still. (Laughter)
57.883	So this has been called the most sublime
59.56	and awesome mystery,
61.854	the deepest and most far-reaching question
64.523	man can pose.
65.583	It's obsessed great thinkers.
67.297	Ludwig Wittgenstein, perhaps the greatest
68.901	philosopher of the 20th century,
71.231	was astonished that there should be a world at all.
73.714	"He wrote in his ""Tractatus,"" Proposition 4.66,"
77.718	"""It is not how things are in the world"
80.408	that is the mystical,
81.76	"it's that the world exists."""
84.095	And if you don't like taking your epigrams
86.313	from a philosopher, try a scientist.
89.224	John Archibald Wheeler, one of the great physicists
91.825	of the 20th century,
93.051	the teacher of Richard Feynman,
94.976	"the coiner of the term ""black hole,"""
97.636	"he said, ""I want to know"
100.059	how come the quantum,
101.792	"how come the universe, how come existence?"""
104.936	And my friend Martin Amis —
106.935	sorry that I'll be doing a lot of
106.935	name-dropping in this talk,
109.612	so get used to it —
110.987	my dear friend Martin Amis once said
115.963	that we're about five Einsteins away from answering
119.183	the mystery of where the universe came from.
121.219	And I've no doubt there are five Einsteins
123.2	in the audience tonight.
125.387	Any Einsteins? Show of hands? No? No? No?
126.89	No Einsteins? Okay.
128.052	So this question, why is there
128.052	something rather than nothing,
132.274	this sublime question, was posed rather late
134.242	in intellectual history.
136.552	It was towards the end of the 17th century,
139.031	the philosopher Leibniz who asked it,
141.993	a very smart guy, Leibniz,
143.736	who invented the calculus
145.886	independently of Isaac Newton,
145.886	at about the same time,
148.74	but for Leibniz, who asked why is
148.74	there something rather than nothing,
151.342	this was not a great mystery.
153.535	He either was or pretended to be
155.931	an Orthodox Christian in his metaphysical outlook,
158.687	and he said it's obvious why the world exists:
161.702	because God created it.
164.164	And God created, indeed, out of nothing at all.
167.449	That's how powerful God is.
168.96	He doesn't need any preexisting
168.96	materials to fashion a world out of.
172.602	He can make it out of sheer nothingness,
174.762	creation ex nihilo.
176.236	And by the way, this is what
177.181	most Americans today believe.
180.02	There is no mystery of existence for them.
181.734	God made it.
183.302	So let's put this in an equation.
185.888	I don't have any slides so
185.888	I'm going to mime my visuals,
188.515	so use your imaginations.
189.95	So it's God + nothing = the world.
195.804	Okay? Now that's the equation.
199.118	And so maybe you don't believe in God.
200.851	Maybe you're a scientific atheist
202.681	or an unscientific atheist,
202.681	and you don't believe in God,
206.015	and you're not happy with it.
207.433	By the way, even if we have this equation,
210.137	God + nothing = the world,
212.039	there's already a problem:
213.725	Why does God exist?
216.759	God doesn't exist by logic alone
218.962	unless you believe the ontological argument,
220.775	and I hope you don't, because
220.775	it's not a good argument.
223.102	So it's conceivable, if God were to exist,
226.263	he might wonder, I'm eternal, I'm all-powerful,
229.413	but where did I come from?
231.843	(Laughter)
234.013	Whence then am I?
235.432	God speaks in a more formal English.
238.64	(Laughter)
240.629	And so one theory is that God was so bored with
243.677	pondering the puzzle of His own existence
245.466	that He created the world just to distract himself.
248.388	But anyway, let's forget about God.
250.5	Take God out of the equation: We have
251.857	________ + nothing = the world.
254.98	Now, if you're a Buddhist,
256.761	you might want to stop right there,
258.505	because essentially what you've got is
260.474	nothing = the world,
262.05	and by symmetry of identity, that means
263.563	the world = nothing. Okay?
265.918	And to a Buddhist, the world
265.918	is just a whole lot of nothing.
268.337	It's just a big cosmic vacuity.
271.443	And we think there's a lot of something out there
273.995	but that's because we're enslaved by our desires.
276.56	If we let our desires melt away,
279.271	we'll see the world for what it truly is,
282.151	a vacuity, nothingness,
284.131	and we'll slip into this happy state of nirvana
286.313	which has been defined as having
288.136	just enough life to enjoy being dead. (Laughter)
291.454	So that's the Buddhist thinking.
293.333	But I'm a Westerner, and I'm still concerned
296.832	with the puzzle of existence, so I've got
298.815	________ + —
300.423	this is going to get serious in a minute, so —
302.581	________ + nothing = the world.
305.607	What are we going to put in that blank?
306.83	Well, how about science?
308.678	Science is our best guide to the nature of reality,
312.229	and the most fundamental science is physics.
315.244	That tells us what naked reality really is,
318.214	that reveals what I call TAUFOTU,
320.84	the True And Ultimate Furniture Of The Universe.
323.83	So maybe physics can fill this blank,
326.482	and indeed, since about the late 1960s or around 1970,
331.544	physicists have purported to give
335.207	a purely scientific explanation of how
338.327	a universe like ours could have popped into existence
341.322	out of sheer nothingness,
343.201	a quantum fluctuation out of the void.
346.281	Stephen Hawking is one of these physicists,
348.339	more recently Alex Vilenkin,
350.645	and the whole thing has been popularized
352.378	by another very fine physicist and friend of mine,
354.571	Lawrence Krauss, who wrote a book called
357.103	"""A Universe from Nothing,"""
359.229	and Lawrence thinks that he's given —
361.445	he's a militant atheist, by the way,
363.526	so he's gotten God out of the picture.
365.15	The laws of quantum field theory,
367.531	the state-of-the-art physics, can show how
369.432	out of sheer nothingness,
370.75	no space, no time, no matter, nothing,
372.975	a little nugget of false vacuum
376.42	can fluctuate into existence,
378.393	and then, by the miracle of inflation,
380.375	blow up into this huge and variegated cosmos
383.46	we see around us.
385.215	Okay, this is a really ingenious scenario.
388.769	It's very speculative. It's fascinating.
391.537	But I've got a big problem with it,
393.865	and the problem is this:
395.75	It's a pseudo-religious point of view.
397.221	Now, Lawrence thinks he's an atheist,
399.217	but he's still in thrall to a religious worldview.
401.965	He sees physical laws as being like divine commands.
406.734	The laws of quantum field theory for him
408.784	"are like fiat lux, ""Let there be light."""
411.395	The laws have some sort of ontological power or clout
415.834	that they can form the abyss,
417.941	that it's pregnant with being.
419.781	They can call a world into existence out of nothing.
422.688	But that's a very primitive view of what
424.635	a physical law is, right?
426.108	We know that physical laws are actually
429.363	generalized descriptions of patterns and regularities
432.407	in the world.
433.612	They don't exist outside the world.
435.985	They don't have any ontic cloud of their own.
437.965	They can't call a world into existence
439.96	out of nothingness.
441.278	That's a very primitive view
442.809	of what a scientific law is.
444.993	And if you don't believe me on this,
446.988	listen to Stephen Hawking,
448.79	who himself put forward a model of the cosmos
452.825	that was self-contained,
453.901	didn't require any outside cause, any creator,
457.539	and after proposing this,
459.267	Hawking admitted that he was still puzzled.
461.681	He said, this model is just equations.
464.993	What breathes fire into the equations
467.852	and creates a world for them to describe?
470.774	He was puzzled by this,
471.907	so equations themselves can't do the magic,
475.712	can't resolve the puzzle of existence.
477.85	And besides, even if the laws could do that,
480.763	why this set of laws?
482.586	Why quantum field theory that describes
485.15	a universe with a certain number of forces
486.85	and particles and so forth?
487.899	Why not a completely different set of laws?
490.19	There are many, many mathematically
490.19	consistent sets of laws.
493.478	Why not no laws at all? Why not sheer nothingness?
496.917	So this is a problem, believe it or not,
498.649	that reflective physicists really think a lot about,
501.647	and at this point they tend to go metaphysical,
504.755	say, well, maybe the set of laws
506.97	that describes our universe,
508.217	it's just one set of laws
509.952	and it describes one part of reality,
511.988	but maybe every consistent set of laws
514.784	describes another part of reality,
516.57	and in fact all possible physical worlds
520.503	really exist, they're all out there.
522.954	We just see a little tiny part of reality
525.237	that's described by the laws of quantum field theory,
527.78	but there are many, many other worlds,
529.512	parts of reality that are described
531.278	by vastly different theories
533.235	that are different from ours in ways we can't imagine,
536.251	that are inconceivably exotic.
539.996	Steven Weinberg, the father
541.733	of the standard model of particle physics,
544.174	has actually flirted with this idea himself,
547	that all possible realities actually exist.
551.243	Also, a younger physicist, Max Tegmark,
554.332	who believes that all mathematical structures exist,
558.708	and mathematical existence is the same thing
560.845	as physical existence,
562.612	so we have this vastly rich multiverse
564.93	that encompasses every logical possibility.
568.371	Now, in taking this metaphysical way out,
571.881	these physicists and also philosophers are actually
574.153	reaching back to a very old idea
576.675	that goes back to Plato.
578.132	It's the principle of plenitude or fecundity,
581.33	or the great chain of being,
583.243	that reality is actually as full as possible.
587.11	It's as far removed from nothingness
588.811	as it could possibly be.
591.706	So we have these two extremes now.
594.2	We have sheer nothingness on one side,
597.499	and we have this vision of a reality
599.997	that encompasses every conceivable world
603.18	at the other extreme: the fullest possible reality,
605.909	nothingness, the simplest possible reality.
608.802	Now what's in between these two extremes?
611.681	There are all kinds of intermediate realities
613.708	that include some things and leave out others.
616.655	So one of these intermediate realities
618.251	is, say, the most mathematically elegant reality,
623.946	that leaves out the inelegant bits,
625.621	the ugly asymmetries and so forth.
628.267	Now, there are some physicists who will tell you
630.593	that we're actually living in the most elegant reality.
634.227	I think that Brian Greene is in the audience,
637.174	and he has written a book
637.174	"called ""The Elegant Universe."""
640.787	He claims that the universe we live in mathematically
643.058	is very elegant.
644.767	Don't believe him. (Laughter)
646.45	It's a pious hope, I wish it were true,
649.537	but I think the other day he admitted to me
651.45	it's really an ugly universe.
654.514	It's stupidly constructed,
655.89	it's got way too many arbitrary coupling constants
659.144	and mass ratios
660.81	and superfluous families of elementary particles,
663.588	and what the hell is dark energy?
665.736	It's a stick and bubble gum contraption.
669.135	It's not an elegant universe. (Laughter)
673.138	And then there's the best of all possible worlds
675.881	in an ethical sense.
677.471	You should get solemn now,
678.65	because a world in which sentient beings
681.845	don't suffer needlessly,
683.465	in which there aren't things like
685.334	childhood cancer or the Holocaust.
687.549	This is an ethical conception.
688.8	Anyway, so between nothingness
690.865	and the fullest possible reality,
692.498	various special realities.
694.043	Nothingness is special. It's the simplest.
696.323	Then there's the most elegant possible reality.
699.833	That's special.
701.197	The fullest possible reality, that's special.
703.849	But what are we leaving out here?
705.365	There's also just the crummy,
708.101	generic realities
709.856	that aren't special in any way,
712.477	that are sort of random.
714.029	They're infinitely removed from nothingness,
716.756	but they fall infinitely short of complete fullness.
720.682	They're a mixture of chaos and order,
723.202	of mathematical elegance and ugliness.
727.4	So I would describe these realities
729.185	as an infinite, mediocre, incomplete mess,
733.312	a generic reality, a kind of cosmic junk shot.
736.692	And these realities,
738.876	is there a deity in any of these realities?
741.142	Maybe, but the deity isn't perfect
743.553	like the Judeo-Christian deity.
745.889	The deity isn't all-good and all-powerful.
749.196	It might be instead 100 percent malevolent
752.527	but only 80 percent effective,
754.63	which pretty much describes the world
754.63	we see around us, I think. (Laughter)
760.767	So I would like to propose that the resolution
763.499	to the mystery of existence
765.335	is that the reality we exist in
769.425	is one of these generic realities.
771.481	Reality has to turn out some way.
774.136	It can either turn out to be nothing
776.206	or everything or something in between.
779.887	So if it has some special feature,
783.578	like being really elegant or really full
785.768	or really simple, like nothingness,
787.376	that would require an explanation.
789.177	But if it's just one of these random, generic realities,
792.336	there's no further explanation for it.
794.486	And indeed, I would say
795.87	that's the reality we live in.
797.85	That's what science is telling us.
800.107	At the beginning of the week,
801.438	we got the exciting information that
804.554	the theory of inflation, which predicts a big,
807.693	infinite, messy, arbitrary, pointless reality,
811.663	it's like a big frothing champagne
815.488	coming out of a bottle endlessly,
818.172	a vast universe, mostly a wasteland
820.264	with little pockets of charm and order and peace,
824.53	this has been confirmed,
826.895	this inflationary scenario, by the observations
829.797	made by radio telescopes in Antarctica
831.89	that looked at the signature of the gravitational waves
834.713	from just before the Big Bang.
836.637	I'm sure you all know about this.
838.482	So anyway, I think there's some evidence
841.306	that this really is the reality that we're stuck with.
844.793	Now, why should you care?
847.9	Well — (Laughter) —
849.136	"the question, ""Why does the world exist?"""
852.56	that's the cosmic question, it sort of rhymes
854.239	with a more intimate question:
855.693	Why do I exist? Why do you exist?
858.776	you know, our existence would
858.776	seem to be amazingly improbable,
862.376	because there's an enormous number
862.376	of genetically possible humans,
866.695	if you can compute it by looking at
868.099	the number of the genes and the
868.099	number of alleles and so forth,
870.441	and a back-of-the-envelope calculation will tell you
872.737	there are about 10 to the 10,000th
874.892	possible humans, genetically.
876.552	That's between a googol and a googolplex.
880.02	And the number of the actual
880.02	humans that have existed
881.636	is 100 billion, maybe 50 billion,
884.13	an infinitesimal fraction, so all of us,
886.195	we've won this amazing cosmic lottery.
888.125	We're here. Okay.
890.244	So what kind of reality do we want to live in?
893.165	Do we want to live in a special reality?
895.415	What if we were living in the
895.415	most elegant possible reality?
899.644	Imagine the existential pressure on us
902.153	to live up to that, to be elegant,
903.992	not to pull down the tone of it.
905.858	Or, what if we were living
905.858	in the fullest possible reality?
908.939	Well then our existence would be guaranteed,
910.95	because every possible thing
912.728	exists in that reality,
914.094	but our choices would be meaningless.
916.255	If I really struggle morally and agonize
919.25	and I decide to do the right thing,
921.33	what difference does it make,
922.525	because there are an infinite number
924.55	of versions of me
925.564	also doing the right thing
926.961	and an infinite number doing the wrong thing.
928.616	So my choices are meaningless.
930.456	So we don't want to live in that special reality.
932.74	And as for the special reality of nothingness,
935.327	we wouldn't be having this conversation.
937.554	So I think living in a generic reality that's mediocre,
944.489	there are nasty bits and nice bits
946.385	and we could make the nice bits bigger
947.927	and the nasty bits smaller
950.266	and that gives us a kind of purpose in life.
953.157	The universe is absurd,
954.563	but we can still construct a purpose,
956.29	and that's a pretty good one,
957.23	and the overall mediocrity of reality
959.895	kind of resonates nicely with the mediocrity
962.5	we all feel in the core of our being.
964.812	And I know you feel it.
966.446	I know you're all special,
967.55	but you're still kind of secretly mediocre,
969.872	don't you think?
971.261	(Laughter) (Applause)
973.198	So anyway, you may say, this 
973.198	puzzle, the mystery of existence,
977.25	it's just silly mystery-mongering.
978.668	You're not astonished at the existence of the universe
982.535	and you're in good company.
984.17	Bertrand Russell said,
986.386	"""I should say the universe is just there, and that's all."""
990.041	Just a brute fact.
991.442	And my professor at Columbia, Sidney Morgenbesser,
994.276	a great philosophical wag,
995.985	"when I said to him, ""Professor Morgenbesser,"
997.602	"why is there something rather than nothing?"""
1000.098	"And he said, ""Oh, even if there was nothing,"
1002.248	"you still wouldn't be satisfied."""
1004.244	So — (Laughter) — okay.
1007.993	So you're not astonished. I don't care.
1010.355	But I will tell you something to conclude
1013.328	that I guarantee you will astonish you,
1015.606	because it's astonished all of the brilliant,
