15.873	"I worked on a film called ""Apollo 13,"""
17.901	and when I worked on this film, I discovered something
19.781	about how our brains work, and how our brains work
22.244	is that, when we're sort of infused with
24.523	either enthusiasm or awe or fondness or whatever,
28.769	it changes and alters our perception of things.
31.177	It changes what we see. It changes what we remember.
33.354	And as an experiment, because I dauntingly create
36.862	a task for myself of recreating a Saturn V launch
40.782	for this particular movie, because I put it out there,
44.204	I felt a little nervous about it, so I need to do an experiment
46.261	and bring a group of people like this in a projection room
49.869	and play this stock footage, and when I played this
52.549	stock footage, I simply wanted to find out
55.35	what people remembered, what was memorable about it?
58.765	What should I actually try to replicate?
60.768	What should I try to emulate to some degree?
64.539	So this is the footage that I was showing everybody.
67.628	And what I discovered is, because of the nature
70.31	of the footage and the fact that we're doing this film,
72.508	there was an emotion that was built into it
74.461	and our collective memories of what this launch meant to us
77.539	and all these various things.
79.213	When I showed it, and I asked, immediately after
81.245	the screening was over, what they thought of it,
84.036	what was your memorable shots, they changed them.
86.502	They were -- had camera moves on them.
88.88	They had all kinds of things. Shots were combined,
91.556	and I was just really curious, I mean, what the hell
94.538	were you looking at just a few minutes ago
95.905	and how come, how'd you come up with this sort of description?
99.749	And what I discovered is, what I should do is not actually
103.597	replicate what they saw, is replicate what they remembered.
107.287	So this is our footage of the launch, based on, basically,
111.269	taking notes, asking people what they thought, and then
113.977	the combination of all the different shots and all
116.419	the different things put together created their sort of
118.347	collective consciousness of what they remembered
120.386	it looked like, but not what it really looked like.
122.036	"So this is what we created for ""Apollo 13."""
125.034	(Launch noises)
129.501	So literally what you're seeing now is the confluence
132.267	of a bunch of different people, a bunch of different memories,
134.328	including my own, of taking a little bit of liberty
137.626	with the subject matter.
139.35	I basically shot everything with short lenses,
141.987	which means that you're very close to the action,
143.904	but framed it very similarly to the long lens shots
146.194	which gives you a sense of distance, so I was basically
148.834	was setting up something that would remind you
150.818	of something you haven't really quite seen before. (Music)
154.29	And then I'm going to show you exactly what it is
156.821	that you were reacting to when you were reacting to it.
160.422	(Music)
173.332	Tom Hanks: Hello, Houston, this is Odyssey.
175.447	It's good to see you again. (Cheers) (Music)
178.238	Rob Legato: I pretend they're clapping for me.
180.678	(Laughter)
182.836	So now I'm in a parking lot. Basically it's a tin can,
186.241	and I'm basically recreating the launch with
188.066	fire extinguishers, fire, I have wax that I threw
192.405	in front of the lens to look like ice, and so basically
195.75	if you believed any of the stuff that I just showed you,
198.567	what you were reacting to, what you're emoting to,
201.748	is something that's a total falsehood, and I found that
204.183	really kind of fascinating.
205.577	And in this particular case, this is the climax of the movie,
208.553	and, you know, the weight of achieving it was simply
211.762	take a model, throw it out of a helicopter, and shoot it.
215.332	And that's simply what I did.
217.335	That's me shooting, and I'm a fairly mediocre operator,
219.812	so I got that nice sense of verisimilitude, of a kind of,
223.351	you know, following the rocket all the way down,
226.183	and giving that little sort of edge, I was desperately
227.862	trying to keep it in frame. So then I come up to the next thing.
231.362	We had a NASA consultant who was actually an astronaut,
233.959	who was actually on some of the missions, of Apollo 15,
236.964	and he was there to basically double check my science.
240.483	And, I guess somebody thought they needed to do that.
244.004	(Laughter)
245.736	I don't know why, but they thought they did.
248.324	So we were, he's a hero, he's an astronaut, and
252.466	we're all sort of excited, and, you know, I gave myself
255.272	the liberty of saying, you know, some of the shots I did
257.743	didn't really suck that bad.
260.152	And so maybe, you know, we were feeling kind of a little
263.412	good about it, so I brought him in here, and he needed
265.869	to really check and see what we were doing,
268.406	and basically give us our A plus report card,
271.392	and so I showed him some shots we were working on,
273.357	and waiting for the reaction that you hope for,
276.467	which is what I got. (Music) (Launch noises)
279.556	So I showed him these two shots,
281.595	and then he basically told me what he thought.
285.012	"(""That's wrong"") (Laughter)"
287.549	Okay. (Laughter)
290.508	It's what you dream about.
292.432	(Laughter)
295.432	So what I got from him is, he turned to me and said,
298.939	"""You would never, ever design a rocket like that."
302.393	You would never have a rocket go up
303.642	while the gantry arms are going out. Can you imagine
305.703	the tragedy that could possibly happen with that?
307.758	"You would never, ever design a rocket like that."""
310.6	And he was looking at me. It's like, Yeah, I don't know
312.747	if you noticed, but I'm the guy out in the parking lot
314.757	recreating one of America's finest moments with
316.685	fire extinguishers.
318.344	(Laughter)
320.703	And I'm not going to argue with you. You're an astronaut,
323.631	a hero, and I'm from New Jersey, so --
325.908	(Laughter)
327.607	I'm just going to show you some footage.
329.644	I'm just going to show you some footage, and tell me what you think.
332.254	And then I did kind of get the reaction I was hoping for.
334.677	So I showed him this, and this is actual footage
336.716	that he was on. This is Apollo 15. This was his mission.
340.261	So I showed him this, and the reaction I got was interesting.
345.537	"(""That's wrong too."") (Laughter)"
348.321	So, and what happened was, I mean, what I sort of intuned
351.555	in that is that he remembered it differently.
354.037	He remembered that was a perfectly safe sort of gantry
356.381	system, perfectly safe rocket launch, because he's sitting
359.084	in a rocket that has, like, a hundred thousand pounds
361.307	of thrust, built by the lowest bidder.
363.581	He was hoping it was going to work out okay.
365.836	(Laughter) (Applause)
368.605	So he twisted his memory around.
370.749	Now, Ron Howard ran into Buzz Aldrin, who was not
373.823	on the movie, so he had no idea that we were faking
376.138	any of this footage, and he just responded
378.364	as he would respond, and I'll run this.
381.194	Ron Howard: Buzz Aldrin came up to me
383.628	"and said, ""Hey, that launch footage, I saw some shots"
388.066	I'd never seen before. Did you guys, what vault did you find
393.064	"that stuff in?"" And I said, ""Well, no vault, Buzz,"
395.525	"we generated all that from scratch."""
398.943	"And he said, ""Huh, that's pretty good. Can we use it?"""
402.847	"(Explosion) (""Sure"") (Laughter)"
406.303	RL: I think he's a great American.
408.23	(Laughter)
412.011	"So, ""Titanic"" was, if you don't know the story,"
415.314	doesn't end well.
417.054	(Laughter)
419.835	Jim Cameron actually photographed the real Titanic.
422.986	So he basically set up, or basically shattered
425.267	the suspension of disbelief, because what he photographed
427.67	was the real thing, a Mir sub going down, or actually
431.097	two Mir subs going down to the real wreck,
433.44	and he created this very haunting footage.
435.477	It's really beautiful, and it conjures up all these
438.35	various different emotions, but he couldn't photograph
440.544	everything, and to tell the story,
443.273	I had to fill in the gaps, which is now rather daunting,
445.123	because now I have to recreate back to back
447.684	what really happened and I had, I'm the only one
450.739	who could really blow it at that point.
455.014	So this is the footage he photographed,
457.054	and it was pretty moving and pretty awe-inspiring.
461.698	So I'm going to just let it run, so you kind of absorb
464.195	this sort of thing, and I'll describe my sort of reactions
467.396	when I was looking at it for the very first time.
470.073	I got the feeling that my brain wanted to basically
474.639	see it come back to life.
476.024	I automatically wanted to see this ship,
478.745	this magnificent ship, basically in all its glory,
481.408	and conversely, I wanted to see it not in all its glory,
484.484	basically go back to what it looks like.
486.932	So I conjured up an effect that I'm later going to show you
490.392	what I tried to do, which is kind of the heart of the movie,
492.797	for me, and so that's why I wanted to do the movie,
496.396	that's why I wanted to create the sort of things I created.
499.992	And I'll show you, you know, another thing that I found
501.973	interesting is what we really were emoting to
504.26	when you take a look at it.
505.678	So here's the behind the scenes, a couple of little shots here.
508.584	So, when you saw my footage,
510.547	you were seeing this: basically, a bunch of guys
513.19	flipping a ship upside down, and the little Mir subs
516.187	are actually about the size of small footballs,
518.792	and shot in smoke.
520.825	Jim went three miles went down, and I went about
523.035	three miles away from the studio
524.633	and photographed this in a garage.
527.233	And so, but what you're emoting to, or what you're looking
529.464	at, had the same feeling, the same haunting quality,
532.576	that Jim's footage had, so I found it so fascinating
535.817	that our brains sort of, once you believe something's real,
540.309	you transfer everything that you feel about it,
543.116	this quality you have, and it's totally artificial.
545.508	It's totally make-believe, yet it's not to you,
549.24	and I found that that was a very interesting thing
551.24	to explore and use, and it caused me to create the next
554.035	effect that I'll show you, which is
555.83	this sort of magic transition, and all I was really attempting
559.045	to do is basically have the audience cue the effect,
562.998	so it became a seamless experience for them,
565.65	that I wasn't showing you my sort of interpretation,
567.98	I was showing you what you wanted to see.
570.901	And the very next shot, right after this --
577.684	So you can see what I was doing.
579.249	So basically, if there's two subs in the same shot,
581.043	I shot it, because where's the camera coming from?
583.951	And when Jim shot it, it was only one sub,
585.512	because he was photographing from the other,
586.783	and I don't remember if I did this or Jim did this.
588.487	I'll give it to Jim, because he could use the pat on the back.
591.857	(Laughter)
598.175	Okay. So now the Titanic transition.
600.514	So this is what I was referring to where I wanted to basically
603.665	magically transplant from one state of the Titanic
606.582	to the other. So I'll just play the shot once. (Music)
610.53	(Music)
613.97	And what I was hoping for is that it just melts in front of you.
625.014	Gloria Stuart: That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight.
629.555	RL: So, what I did is basically I had another
632.344	screening room experience where I was basically tracking
635.182	where I was looking, or where we were looking,
637.484	and of course you're looking at the two people on the bow
639.902	of the ship, and then at some point,
642.095	I'm changing the periphery of the shot,
644.113	I'm changing, it's becoming the rusted wreck,
646.435	and then I would run it every day, and then I would find
649.444	exactly the moment that I stopped looking at them
652.511	and start noticing the rest of it, and the moment
654.701	my eye shifted, we just marked it to the frame.
657.259	The moment my eye shifted, I immediately started
659.635	to change them, so now somehow you missed
661.974	where it started and where it stopped.
664.314	And so I'll just show it one more time.
666.467	(Music) And it's literally done by using what our brains
669.664	naturally do for us, which is, as soon as you shift
673.399	your attention, something changes, and then I left
675.351	the little scarf going, because it really wanted to be
677.494	a ghostly shot, really wanted to feel like they were still
681.347	on the wreck, essentially. That's where they were buried forever.
684.677	Or something like that. I just made that up.
686.686	(Laughter)
689.155	It was, incidentally, the last time I ever saw daylight.
691.039	It was a long film to work on. (Laughter)
694.51	"Now, ""Hugo"" was another interesting movie, because"
696.792	the movie itself is about film illusions.
698.902	It's about how our brain is tricked into seeing a persistence
701.767	of vision that creates a motion picture,
704.585	and one of the things I had to do is, we —
708.259	Sasha Baron Cohen is a very clever, very smart guy,
711.586	comedian, wanted to basically do an homage to the kind of
713.737	the Buster Keaton sort of slapstick things, and he wanted
715.965	his leg brace to get caught on a moving train.
719.273	Very dangerous, very impossible to do, and particularly
721.394	on our stage, because there literally is no way to actually
724.719	move this train, because it fits so snugly into our set.
729.583	So let me show you the scene, and then I basically
732.046	used the trick that was identified by Sergei Eisenstein,
735.729	which is, if you have a camera that's moving with a moving
738.903	object, what is not moving appears to be moving,
741.672	and what is moving appears to be stopped,
744.271	so what you're actually seeing now is the train is not
747.186	moving at all, and what is actually moving is the floor.
752.266	So this is the shot. That's a little video of
755.297	what you're looking at there, which is our little test,
758.579	so that's actually what you're seeing, and I thought it was
761.158	sort of an interesting thing, because it was, part
763.315	of the homage of the movie itself is coming up with this
766.64	sort of genius trick which I can't take credit for.
769.158	I'd love to but I can't, because it was invented
771.823	like in 1910 or something like that, is I told Marty,
776.468	and it's kind of one of those mind things that it's
778.124	really hard to really get until you actually see it work,
780.505	and I said, you know, what I was going to do, and he said,
783.385	"""So, let me see if I can get this straight. The thing with the wheels?"
785.607	"That doesn't move."""
787.56	(Laughter) (Applause)
790.978	"""And the thing without the wheels, that moves."""
794.954	Precisely. (Laughter)
797.429	Brings me to the next, and final --
800.224	Marty's not going to see this, is he? (Laughter)
804.293	This isn't viewed outside of -- (Laughter)
808.083	The next illustration is something that, there's like
812.51	all one shot theory. It's a very elegant way of telling a story,
815.572	especially if you're following somebody on a journey,
817.629	and that journey basically tells something about
819.937	their personality in a very concise way,
822.178	"and what we wanted to do based on the shot in ""Goodfellas,"""
824.561	which is one of the great shots ever,
826.445	a Martin Scorsese film, of basically following Henry Hill
829.822	through what it feels like to be a gangster walk
831.958	going through the Copacabana and being treated in a special way.
834.521	He was the master of his universe, and we wanted Hugo
838.028	to feel the same way, so we created this shot.
840.684	(Music)
844.001	That's Hugo. (Music)
849.027	And we felt that if we could basically move the camera
852.104	with him, we would feel what it feels like to be this boy
854.794	who is basically the master of his universe,
857.585	and his universe is, you know, behind the scenes
860.044	in the bowels of this particular train station
862.685	that only he can actually navigate through
864.989	and do it this way, and we had to make it feel that
867.288	this is his normal, everyday sort of life,
869.595	so the idea of doing it as one shot was very important,
872.161	and of course, in shooting in 3D, which is basically
874.777	it's a huge camera that's hanging off of a giant stick,
878.788	so to recreate a steadycam shot was the task,
882.31	and make it feel kind of like what the reaction you got
885.576	"when you saw the ""Goodfellas"" shot."
887.138	So what you're now going to see is how we actually did it.
890.939	It's actually five separate sets shot at five different times
894.124	with two different boys.
895.311	The one on the left is where the shot ends,
897.473	and the shot on the right is where it takes over,
902.899	and now we switch boys, so it went from Asa Butterfield,
906.404	who's the star of the show, to his stand-in. (Music)
910.278	I wouldn't say his stunt double. There's a crazy rig
912.127	that we built for this. (Music)
914.591	And so this is, and now this is set number three
918.142	we're into, and then we're going to go into, basically
922.522	the very last moment of the shot is actually
925.186	the steadycam shot. Everything else was shot on cranes
927.468	and various things like that, and it literally was done
929.513	over five different sets, two different boys, different times,
932.81	and it all had to feel like it was all one shot, and what was
935.64	sort of great for me was it was probably
940.335	the best-reviewed shot I've ever worked on,
942.852	and, you know, I was kind of proud of it when I was done,
945.44	which is, you should never really be proud of stuff, I guess.
950.338	So I was kind of proud of it, and I went to a friend of mine,
953.148	"and said, ""You know, this is, you know, kind of"
955.072	the best-reviewed shot I've ever worked on.
956.944	"What do you think was the reason?"""
959.855	"And he said, ""Because no one knows"
961.265	"you had anything to do with it."""
963.231	(Laughter)
966.037	So, all I can say is, thank you,
969.951	and that's my presentation for you. (Applause)
975.151	(Applause)
