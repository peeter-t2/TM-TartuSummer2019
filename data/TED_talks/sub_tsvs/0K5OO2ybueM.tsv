12.748	So, a few years ago I heard
12.748	an interesting rumor.
16.209	Apparently, the head
16.209	of a large pet food company
18.621	would go into the annual
18.621	shareholder's meeting
20.9	with can of dog food.
22.385	And he would eat the can of dog food.
24.51	And this was his way of convincing them
24.51	that if it was good enough for him,
28.087	it was good enough for their pets.
29.788	This strategy is now known
29.788	"as ""dogfooding,"""
32.248	and it's a common strategy
32.248	in the business world.
34.591	It doesn't mean everyone
34.591	goes in and eats dog food,
37.099	but businesspeople
37.099	will use their own products
39.344	to demonstrate that they feel --
40.905	that they're confident in them.
42.634	Now, this is a widespread practice,
44.583	but I think what's really interesting
44.583	is when you find exceptions
47.702	to this rule,
48.877	when you find cases of businesses
48.877	or people in businesses
51.608	who don't use their own products.
53.226	Turns out there's one industry
53.226	where this happens in a common way,
56.371	in a pretty regular way,
57.555	and that is the screen-based
57.555	tech industry.
60.013	So, in 2010, Steve Jobs,
60.013	when he was releasing the iPad,
64.431	described the iPad as a device
64.431	"that was ""extraordinary."""
68.197	"""The best browsing experience"
68.197	you've ever had;
70.761	way better than a laptop,
70.761	way better than a smartphone.
73.518	"It's an incredible experience."""
75.069	A couple of months later,
75.069	he was approached by a journalist
77.878	from the New York Times,
79.058	and they had a long phone call.
80.581	At the end of the call,
81.775	the journalist threw in a question
81.775	that seemed like a sort of softball.
85.189	"He said to him, ""Your kids"
85.189	"must love the iPad."""
88.623	There's an obvious answer to this,
90.276	but what Jobs said
90.276	really staggered the journalist.
92.919	He was very surprised,
94.134	"because he said, ""They haven't used it."
96.733	We limit how much technology
96.733	"our kids use at home."""
99.679	This is a very common thing
99.679	in the tech world.
103.566	In fact, there's a school
103.566	quite near Silicon Valley
106.025	called the Waldorf School
106.025	of the Peninsula,
108.322	and they don't introduce screens
108.322	until the eighth grade.
111.51	What's really interesting about the school
113.576	is that 75 percent
113.576	of the kids who go there
115.649	have parents who are high-level
115.649	Silicon Valley tech execs.
119.162	So when I heard about this, I thought
119.162	it was interesting and surprising,
122.701	and it pushed me to consider
122.701	what screens were doing to me
125.757	and to my family and the people I loved,
127.738	and to people at large.
129.024	So for the last five years,
130.97	as a professor of business and psychology,
133.027	I've been studying the effect
133.027	of screens on our lives.
136.709	And I want to start by just focusing
136.709	on how much time they take from us,
140.815	and then we can talk about
140.815	what that time looks like.
143.345	What I'm showing you here
143.345	is the average 24-hour workday
146.036	at three different points in history:
151.907	and then data that I collected,
151.907	actually, only last week.
154.949	And a lot of things haven't changed
156.722	all that much.
159.14	We sleep roughly seven-and-a-half
159.14	to eight hours a day;
161.939	some people say that's declined slightly,
161.939	but it hasn't changed much.
165.28	We work eight-and-a-half
165.28	to nine hours a day.
168.558	We engage in survival activities --
170.314	these are things like eating
170.314	and bathing and looking after kids --
173.465	about three hours a day.
174.645	That leaves this white space.
176.197	That's our personal time.
177.888	That space is incredibly important to us.
181.114	That's the space where we do things
181.114	that make us individuals.
184.012	That's where hobbies happen,
184.012	where we have close relationships,
187.137	where we really think about our lives,
187.137	where we get creative,
190.043	where we zoom back and try to work out
191.881	whether our lives have been meaningful.
193.765	We get some of that from work as well,
195.617	but when people look back on their lives
197.556	and wonder what their lives have been like
199.584	at the end of their lives,
200.851	you look at the last things they say --
202.762	they are talking about those moments
202.762	that happen in that white personal space.
206.487	So it's sacred; it's important to us.
208.514	Now, what I'm going to do is show you
210.389	how much of that space
210.389	is taken up by screens across time.
213.665	In 2007,
215.014	this much.
216.189	That was the year that Apple
216.189	introduced the first iPhone.
219.193	Eight years later,
221.059	this much.
223.138	Now, this much.
224.951	That's how much time we spend
224.951	of that free time in front of our screens.
228.413	This yellow area, this thin sliver,
228.413	is where the magic happens.
231.74	That's where your humanity lives.
233.346	And right now, it's in a very small box.
236.063	So what do we do about this?
237.712	Well, the first question is:
239.093	What does that red space look like?
240.976	Now, of course, screens are miraculous
243.105	in a lot of ways.
244.557	I live in New York,
245.838	a lot of my family lives in Australia,
247.86	and I have a one-year-old son.
249.314	The way I've been able to introduce
249.314	them to him is with screens.
253.236	I couldn't have done that
255.35	in quite the same way.
256.532	So there's a lot of good
256.532	that comes from them.
258.713	One thing you can do is ask yourself:
260.583	What goes on during that time?
262.69	How enriching are the apps
262.69	that we're using?
265.152	And some are enriching.
266.45	If you stop people while
266.45	they're using them and say,
268.916	"""Tell us how you feel right now,"""
270.528	they say they feel pretty good
270.528	about these apps --
272.948	those that focus on relaxation,
272.948	exercise, weather, reading,
276.332	education and health.
277.899	They spend an average of nine
277.899	minutes a day on each of these.
281.057	These apps make them much less happy.
283.919	About half the people, when you interrupt
283.919	"them and say, ""How do you feel?"""
287.547	say they don't feel good about using them.
289.679	What's interesting about these --
291.334	dating, social networking, gaming,
293.068	entertainment, news, web browsing --
295.818	people spend 27 minutes a day
295.818	on each of these.
298.448	We're spending three times longer
298.448	on the apps that don't make us happy.
302.024	That doesn't seem very wise.
304.706	One of the reasons we spend
304.706	so much time on these apps
307.268	that make us unhappy
308.444	is they rob us of stopping cues.
310	Stopping cues were everywhere
310	in the 20th century.
312.403	They were baked into everything we did.
314.291	A stopping cue is basically a signal
314.291	that it's time to move on,
317.731	to do something new,
317.731	to do something different.
320.452	And -- think about newspapers;
320.452	eventually you get to the end,
323.672	you fold the newspaper away,
323.672	you put it aside.
325.993	The same with magazines, books --
325.993	you get to the end of a chapter,
329.175	prompts you to consider
329.175	whether you want to continue.
332.324	You watched a show on TV,
332.324	eventually the show would end,
335.046	and then you'd have a week
335.046	until the next one came.
337.475	There were stopping cues everywhere.
339.253	But the way we consume media today
339.253	is such that there are no stopping cues.
343.743	The news feed just rolls on,
345.342	and everything's bottomless:
345.342	Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,
349.039	email, text messaging, the news.
352.205	And when you do check
352.205	all sorts of other sources,
355.199	you can just keep going on and on and on.
357.564	So, we can get a cue about what to do
357.564	from Western Europe,
361.998	where they seem to have a number
361.998	of pretty good ideas in the workplace.
365.423	Here's one example.
365.423	This is a Dutch design firm.
367.855	And what they've done
367.855	is rigged the desks to the ceiling.
371.265	And at 6pm every day,
372.441	it doesn't matter who you're emailing
372.441	or what you're doing,
375.272	the desks rise to the ceiling.
376.773	(Laughter)
377.905	(Applause)
379.179	Four days a week, the space
379.179	turns into a yoga studio,
383.446	one day a week, into a dance club.
385.101	It's really up to you which ones
385.101	you stick around for.
387.654	But this is a great stopping rule,
389.365	because it means at the end of the day,
391.276	everything stops, there's no way to work.
393.337	At Daimler, the German car company,
393.337	they've got another great strategy.
396.805	When you go on vacation,
398.359	instead of saying,
398.359	"""This person's on vacation,"
400.587	"they'll get back to you eventually,"""
402.334	"they say, ""This person's on vacation,"
402.334	so we've deleted your email.
405.58	This person will never see
405.58	"the email you just sent."""
408.25	(Laughter)
409.29	"""You can email back in a couple of weeks,"
411.955	"or you can email someone else."""
413.465	(Laughter)
414.517	And so --
415.713	(Applause)
420.702	You can imagine what that's like.
422.364	You go on vacation,
422.364	and you're actually on vacation.
424.846	The people who work at this company feel
426.839	that they actually get a break from work.
429.225	But of course, that doesn't tell us much
431.166	about what we should do
431.166	at home in our own lives,
433.489	so I want to make some suggestions.
435.195	It's easy to say, between 5 and 6pm,
435.195	I'm going to not use my phone.
439.712	The problem is, 5 and 6pm
439.712	looks different on different days.
443.167	I think a far better strategy is to say,
445.378	I do certain things every day,
446.871	there are certain occasions
446.871	that happen every day,
449.249	like eating dinner.
450.532	Sometimes I'll be alone,
451.874	sometimes with other people,
453.404	sometimes in a restaurant,
454.707	sometimes at home,
455.919	but the rule that I've adopted is:
455.919	I will never use my phone at the table.
459.943	It's far away,
461.401	as far away as possible.
462.886	Because we're really bad
462.886	at resisting temptation.
465.219	But when you have a stopping cue
465.219	that, every time dinner begins,
468.314	my phone goes far away,
469.494	you avoid temptation all together.
471.186	At first, it hurts.
472.927	I had massive FOMO.
474.573	(Laughter)
475.663	I struggled.
477.189	But what happens is, you get used to it.
479.143	You overcome the withdrawal
479.143	the same way you would from a drug,
482.265	and what happens is, life becomes
482.265	more colorful, richer,
485.074	more interesting --
486.253	you have better conversations.
487.927	You really connect with the people
487.927	who are there with you.
490.975	I think it's a fantastic strategy,
492.643	and we know it works,
492.643	because when people do this --
495.156	and I've tracked a lot of people
495.156	who have tried this --
497.77	it expands.
498.964	They feel so good about it,
500.304	they start doing it for the first
500.304	hour of the day in the morning.
503.42	They start putting their phones
503.42	on airplane mode on the weekend.
506.569	That way, your phone remains a camera,
506.569	but it's no longer a phone.
510.33	It's a really powerful idea,
511.689	and we know people feel much better
511.689	about their lives when they do this.
515.793	So what's the take home here?
517.406	Screens are miraculous;
517.406	I've already said that,
519.669	and I feel that it's true.
521.045	But the way we use them is a lot like
521.045	driving down a really fast, long road,
525.689	and you're in a car where the accelerator
525.689	is mashed to the floor,
528.876	it's kind of hard
528.876	to reach the brake pedal.
530.948	You've got a choice.
533.33	You can either glide by, past,
533.33	say, the beautiful ocean scenes
537.517	and take snaps out the window --
537.517	that's the easy thing to do --
540.637	or you can go out of your way
540.637	to move the car to the side of the road,
544.201	to push that brake pedal,
545.697	to get out,
546.874	take off your shoes and socks,
548.779	take a couple of steps onto the sand,
551.068	feel what the sand feels like
551.068	under your feet,
553.332	walk to the ocean,
554.507	and let the ocean lap at your ankles.
557.027	Your life will be richer
557.027	and more meaningful
559.866	because you breathe in that experience,
562.108	and because you've left
562.108	your phone in the car.
564.528	Thank you.
565.723	(Applause)
