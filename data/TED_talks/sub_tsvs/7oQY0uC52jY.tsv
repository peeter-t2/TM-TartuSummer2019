12.381	What do we know about the future?
14.383	Difficult question,
14.383	simple answer: nothing.
17.448	We cannot predict the future.
19.939	We only can create a vision
19.939	of the future, how it might be,
24.578	a vision which reveals disruptive
24.578	ideas, which is inspiring,
27.911	and this is the most important reason
30.197	which breaks the chains
30.197	of common thinking.
33.245	There are a lot of people
34.573	who created their own vision
34.573	about the future,
36.788	for instance, this vision here
36.788	from the early 20th century.
39.979	It says here that this
39.979	is the ocean plane of the future.
44.039	It takes only one and a half days
44.039	to cross the Atlantic Ocean.
47.652	Today, we know that this future
47.652	vision didn't come true.
51.153	So this is our largest
51.153	airplane which we have,
54.085	the Airbus A380, and it's quite huge,
56.884	so a lot of people fit in there
58.432	and it's technically completely different
60.953	than the vision I've shown to you.
63.164	I'm working in a team with Airbus,
65.134	and we have created our vision
66.713	about a more sustainable
66.713	future of aviation.
69.645	So sustainability is quite
69.645	important for us,
72.13	which should incorporate social
73.904	but as well as environmental
73.904	and economic values.
76.994	So we have created a very
76.994	disruptive structure
79.9	which mimics the design
79.9	of bone, or a skeleton,
83.508	which occurs in nature.
85.233	So that's why it looks
85.233	maybe a little bit weird,
87.543	especially to the people who deal
87.543	with structures in general.
91.311	But at least it's just a kind of artwork
93.774	to explore our ideas
93.774	about a different future.
98.964	What are the main customers of the future?
101.116	So, we have the old, we have the young,
102.998	we have the uprising power of women,
105.696	and there's one mega-trend
105.696	which affects all of us.
109.699	These are the future anthropometrics.
112.124	So our children are getting
112.124	larger, but at the same time
115.616	we are growing into different directions.
118.118	So what we need is space
118.118	inside the aircraft,
123.802	inside a very dense area.
125.927	These people have different needs.
127.665	So we see a clear need
127.665	of active health promotion,
131.223	especially in the case of the old people.
133.895	We want to be treated as individuals.
135.765	We like to be productive
135.765	throughout the entire travel chain,
141.258	and what we are doing in the future is
143.555	we want to use the latest
143.555	man-machine interface,
146.735	and we want to integrate this
146.735	and show this in one product.
151.106	So we combined these needs
151.106	with technology's themes.
154.548	So for instance, we are asking ourselves,
157.076	how can we create more light?
159.289	How can we bring more natural
159.289	light into the airplane?
161.885	So this airplane has no
161.885	windows anymore, for example.
165.259	What about the data
165.259	and communication software
167.992	which we need in the future?
169.665	My belief is that the airplane
169.665	of the future
172.566	will get its own consciousness.
174.699	It will be more like a living organism
177.178	than just a collection
177.178	of very complex technology.
181.6	This will be very different in the future.
183.722	It will communicate directly
185.291	with the passenger in its environment.
188.171	And then we are talking
188.171	also about materials,
190.338	synthetic biology, for example.
192.258	And my belief is that we will get
192.258	more and more
195.973	new materials which we can
195.973	put into structure later on,
199.675	because structure is one of the key
199.675	issues in aircraft design.
203.821	So let's compare the old
203.821	world with the new world.
207.093	I just want to show you here
207.093	what we are doing today.
209.641	So this is a bracket of an A380
209.641	crew rest compartment.
213.34	It takes a lot of weight,
215.037	and it follows the classical design rules.
218.188	This here is an equal bracket
218.188	for the same purpose.
221.839	It follows the design of bone.
223.988	The design process
223.988	is completely different.
226.508	At the one hand, we have 1.2 kilos,
229.229	and at the other hand 0.6 kilos.
231.172	So this technology, 3D
231.172	printing, and new design rules
234.439	really help us to reduce the weight,
236.178	which is the biggest issue
236.178	in aircraft design,
238.626	because it's directly linked
238.626	to greenhouse gas emissions.
241.365	Push this idea a little bit forward.
243.185	So how does nature build its
243.185	components and structures?
248.076	So nature is very clever.
248.076	It puts all the information
251.117	into these small building
251.117	blocks, which we call DNA.
254.314	And nature builds large
254.314	skeletons out of it.
256.89	So we see a bottom-up approach here,
259.384	because all the information,
259.384	as I said, are inside the DNA.
262.549	And this is combined
262.549	with a top-down approach,
264.764	because what we are doing
264.764	in our daily life
266.861	is we train our muscles,
266.861	we train our skeleton,
269.966	and it's getting stronger.
271.966	And the same approach can be
271.966	applied to technology as well.
274.801	So our building block is carbon
274.801	nanotubes, for example,
278.187	to create a large, rivet-less
278.187	skeleton at the end of the day.
282.453	How this looks in particular,
282.453	you can show it here.
285.507	So imagine you have
285.507	carbon nanotubes growing
287.641	inside a 3D printer,
289.078	and they are embedded
289.078	inside a matrix of plastic,
292.277	and follow the forces
292.277	which occur in your component.
295.37	And you've got trillions of them.
297.113	So you really align them to wood,
299.306	and you take this wood and make
299.306	morphological optimization,
302.475	so you make structures, sub-structures,
304.434	which allows you to transmit
304.434	electrical energy or data.
308.467	And now we take this
308.467	material, combine this
310.539	with a top-down approach,
311.982	and build bigger and bigger components.
315.534	So how might the airplane
315.534	of the future look?
318.579	So we have very different
318.579	seats which adapt
320.7	to the shape of the future passenger,
322.486	with the different anthropometrics.
324.197	We have social areas inside the aircraft
326.743	which might turn into a place
329.503	where you can play virtual golf.
331.703	And finally, this bionic structure,
334.166	which is covered by a transparent
336.327	biopolymer membrane,
336.327	will really change radically
340.191	how we look at aircrafts in the future.
342.584	So as Jason Silva said,
344.608	if we can imagine it, why not make it so?
347.131	See you in the future. Thank you.
348.866	(Applause)
