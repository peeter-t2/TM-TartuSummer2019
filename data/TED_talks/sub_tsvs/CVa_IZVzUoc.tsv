13.037	Two twin domes,
15.708	two radically opposed design cultures.
19.709	One is made of thousands of steel parts,
22.773	the other of a single silk thread.
26.035	One is synthetic, the other organic.
28.936	One is imposed on the environment,
31.237	the other creates it.
33.666	One is designed for nature,
33.666	the other is designed by her.
38.032	Michelangelo said that
38.032	when he looked at raw marble,
40.949	he saw a figure struggling to be free.
43.425	The chisel was Michelangelo's only tool.
49.261	But living things are not chiseled.
51.999	They grow.
53.999	And in our smallest units of life,
53.999	our cells, we carry all the information
59.489	that's required for every other cell
59.489	to function and to replicate.
66.155	Tools also have consequences.
68.922	At least since the Industrial Revolution,
68.922	the world of design has been dominated
73.556	by the rigors of manufacturing
73.556	and mass production.
76.703	Assembly lines have dictated
76.703	a world made of parts,
79.999	framing the imagination
79.999	of designers and architects
82.615	who have been trained to think
82.615	about their objects as assemblies
85.743	of discrete parts with distinct functions.
90.165	But you don't find homogenous
90.165	material assemblies in nature.
95.434	Take human skin, for example.
98.054	Our facial skins are thin
98.054	with large pores.
101.999	Our back skins are thicker,
101.999	with small pores.
105.559	One acts mainly as filter,
108.201	the other mainly as barrier,
109.989	and yet it's the same skin:
109.989	no parts, no assemblies.
114.281	It's a system that gradually
114.281	varies its functionality
117.67	by varying elasticity.
119.835	So here this is a split screen
119.835	to represent my split world view,
123.801	the split personality of every designer
123.801	and architect operating today
128.229	between the chisel and the gene,
130.572	between machine and organism,
130.572	between assembly and growth,
135.434	between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
138.734	These two worldviews,
138.734	my left brain and right brain,
141.76	analysis and synthesis, will play out
141.76	on the two screens behind me.
149.754	My work, at its simplest level,
152.224	is about uniting these two worldviews,
154.983	moving away from assembly
157.221	and closer into growth.
161.099	You're probably asking yourselves:
163.235	Why now?
164.766	Why was this not possible 10
164.766	or even five years ago?
170.451	We live in a very special time in history,
172.603	a rare time,
174.699	a time when the confluence of four fields
174.699	is giving designers access to tools
179.302	we've never had access to before.
182.205	These fields are computational design,
185.093	allowing us to design
185.093	complex forms with simple code;
190.125	additive manufacturing,
190.125	letting us produce parts
194.183	by adding material
194.183	rather than carving it out;
197.833	materials engineering, which lets us
197.833	design the behavior of materials
201.301	in high resolution;
203.042	and synthetic biology,
204.923	enabling us to design new biological
204.923	functionality by editing DNA.
209.491	And at the intersection
209.491	of these four fields,
211.755	my team and I create.
213.492	Please meet the minds and hands
215.921	of my students.
219.772	We design objects and products
219.772	and structures and tools across scales,
225.457	from the large-scale,
227.252	like this robotic arm
227.252	with an 80-foot diameter reach
230.792	with a vehicular base that will
230.792	one day soon print entire buildings,
234.95	to nanoscale graphics made entirely
234.95	of genetically engineered microorganisms
239.061	that glow in the dark.
241.261	Here we've reimagined the mashrabiya,
243.469	an archetype of ancient
243.469	Arabic architecture,
246.866	and created a screen where
246.866	every aperture is uniquely sized
250.454	to shape the form of light and heat
250.454	moving through it.
254.999	In our next project,
256.739	we explore the possibility
256.739	of creating a cape and skirt --
259.973	this was for a Paris fashion show
259.973	with Iris van Herpen --
263.187	like a second skin
263.187	that are made of a single part,
265.999	stiff at the contours,
265.999	flexible around the waist.
269.589	Together with my long-term
269.589	3D printing collaborator Stratasys,
273.813	we 3D-printed this cape and skirt
273.813	with no seams between the cells,
278.844	and I'll show more objects like it.
281.452	This helmet combines
281.452	stiff and soft materials
284.889	in 20-micron resolution.
288.025	This is the resolution of a human hair.
290.437	It's also the resolution of a CT scanner.
293.531	That designers have access
295.096	to such high-resolution
295.096	analytic and synthetic tools,
299.518	enables to design products that fit
299.518	not only the shape of our bodies,
304.104	but also the physiological
304.104	makeup of our tissues.
308.445	Next, we designed an acoustic chair,
310.477	a chair that would be at once
310.477	structural, comfortable
313.713	and would also absorb sound.
316.529	Professor Carter, my collaborator, and I
316.529	turned to nature for inspiration,
320.999	and by designing this irregular
320.999	surface pattern,
323.708	it becomes sound-absorbent.
326.659	We printed its surface
326.659	out of 44 different properties,
330.583	varying in rigidity, opacity and color,
334	corresponding to pressure points
334	on the human body.
338.023	Its surface, as in nature,
338.023	varies its functionality
342.039	not by adding another material
342.039	or another assembly,
345.69	but by continuously and delicately
345.69	varying material property.
352.496	But is nature ideal?
356.146	Are there no parts in nature?
361.185	I wasn't raised
361.185	in a religious Jewish home,
364.48	but when I was young,
365.66	my grandmother used to tell me
365.66	stories from the Hebrew Bible,
369.081	and one of them stuck with me and came
369.081	to define much of what I care about.
373.11	As she recounts:
375.142	"""On the third day of Creation,"
375.142	God commands the Earth
378.109	"to grow a fruit-bearing fruit tree."""
380.649	For this first fruit tree,
380.649	there was to be no differentiation
383.9	between trunk, branches,
383.9	leaves and fruit.
388.294	The whole tree was a fruit.
392.229	Instead, the land grew trees
392.229	that have bark and stems and flowers.
398.337	The land created a world made of parts.
402.514	I often ask myself,
404.396	"""What would design be like"
404.396	if objects were made of a single part?
409.412	Would we return to a better
409.412	"state of creation?"""
414.999	So we looked for that biblical material,
416.978	that fruit-bearing fruit tree
416.978	kind of material, and we found it.
423.494	The second-most abundant biopolymer
423.494	on the planet is called chitin,
427.274	and some 100 million tons of it
427.274	are produced every year
430.999	by organisms such as shrimps,
430.999	crabs, scorpions and butterflies.
435.259	We thought if we could tune
435.259	its properties,
437.999	we could generate structures
437.999	that are multifunctional
440.651	out of a single part.
442.235	So that's what we did.
444.999	We called Legal Seafood --
447.016	(Laughter)
448.076	we ordered a bunch of shrimp shells,
450.957	we grinded them
450.957	and we produced chitosan paste.
454.583	By varying chemical concentrations,
456.571	we were able to achieve
456.571	a wide array of properties --
459.889	from dark, stiff and opaque,
461.69	to light, soft and transparent.
464.689	In order to print the structures
464.689	in large scale,
467.653	we built a robotically controlled
467.653	extrusion system with multiple nozzles.
472.39	The robot would vary
472.39	material properties on the fly
475.572	and create these 12-foot-long structures
475.572	made of a single material,
483.465	When the parts are ready,
483.465	they're left to dry
486.163	and find a form naturally
486.163	upon contact with air.
490.313	So why are we still
490.313	designing with plastics?
495.999	The air bubbles that were a byproduct
495.999	of the printing process
499.486	were used to contain
499.486	photosynthetic microorganisms
502.386	that first appeared on our planet
502.386	3.5 billion year ago,
505.283	as we learned yesterday.
507.999	Together with our collaborators
507.999	at Harvard and MIT,
510.61	we embedded bacteria
510.61	that were genetically engineered
513.387	to rapidly capture carbon
513.387	from the atmosphere
516.553	and convert it into sugar.
519.449	For the first time,
521.26	we were able to generate structures
521.26	that would seamlessly transition
525.25	from beam to mesh,
528.608	and if scaled even larger, to windows.
532.019	A fruit-bearing fruit tree.
534.626	Working with an ancient material,
537.336	one of the first lifeforms on the planet,
539.999	plenty of water and a little bit
539.999	of synthetic biology,
543.999	we were able to transform a structure
543.999	made of shrimp shells
547.53	into an architecture
547.53	that behaves like a tree.
551.724	And here's the best part:
554.049	for objects designed to biodegrade,
556.02	put them in the sea,
556.02	and they will nourish marine life;
559.74	place them in soil,
559.74	and they will help grow a tree.
564.415	The setting for our next exploration
564.415	using the same design principles
568.456	was the solar system.
570.693	We looked for the possibility
570.693	of creating life-sustaining clothing
574.999	for interplanetary voyages.
578.707	To do that, we needed to contain bacteria
578.707	and be able to control their flow.
583.769	So like the periodic table, we came up
583.769	with our own table of the elements:
588.353	new lifeforms that
588.353	were computationally grown,
591.766	additively manufactured
593.831	and biologically augmented.
598.096	I like to think of synthetic biology
598.096	as liquid alchemy,
601.645	only instead of transmuting
601.645	precious metals,
604.408	you're synthesizing new biological
604.408	functionality inside very small channels.
608.171	It's called microfluidics.
611.067	We 3D-printed our own channels
611.067	in order to control the flow
615.266	of these liquid bacterial cultures.
619.432	In our first piece of clothing,
619.432	we combined two microorganisms.
623.457	The first is cyanobacteria.
625.392	It lives in our oceans
625.392	and in freshwater ponds.
628.392	And the second, E. coli, the bacterium
628.392	that inhabits the human gut.
632.862	One converts light into sugar,
632.862	the other consumes that sugar
636.459	and produces biofuels
636.459	useful for the built environment.
639.832	Now, these two microorganisms
639.832	never interact in nature.
644.343	In fact, they never met each other.
646.225	They've been here,
646.225	engineered for the first time,
649.428	to have a relationship
649.428	inside a piece of clothing.
653.34	Think of it as evolution
653.34	not by natural selection,
656.999	but evolution by design.
659.515	In order to contain these relationships,
661.738	we've created a single channel
661.738	that resembles the digestive tract,
665.867	that will help flow these bacteria
665.867	and alter their function along the way.
670.822	We then started growing
670.822	these channels on the human body,
674.475	varying material properties
674.475	according to the desired functionality.
677.828	Where we wanted more photosynthesis,
677.828	we would design more transparent channels.
683.101	This wearable digestive system,
683.101	when it's stretched end to end,
688.229	spans 60 meters.
690.317	This is half the length
690.317	of a football field,
692.999	and 10 times as long
692.999	as our small intestines.
697.612	And here it is for the first time
697.612	unveiled at TED --
700.344	our first photosynthetic wearable,
702.471	liquid channels glowing with life
702.471	inside a wearable clothing.
706.694	(Applause)
707.846	Thank you.
711.871	"Mary Shelley said, ""We are unfashioned"
711.871	"creatures, but only half made up."""
715.871	What if design could provide
715.871	that other half?
719.776	What if we could create structures
719.776	that would augment living matter?
726.035	What if we could create
726.035	personal microbiomes
729.492	that would scan our skins,
729.492	repair damaged tissue
733.391	and sustain our bodies?
736.062	Think of this as a form of edited biology.
738.999	This entire collection, Wanderers,
738.999	that was named after planets,
742.999	was not to me really about fashion per se,
745.681	but it provided an opportunity
745.681	to speculate about the future
749.064	of our race on our planet and beyond,
751.71	to combine scientific insight
751.71	with lots of mystery
755.465	and to move away
755.465	from the age of the machine
758.81	to a new age of symbiosis
758.81	between our bodies,
762.31	the microorganisms that we inhabit,
764.773	our products and even our buildings.
766.725	I call this material ecology.
769.591	To do this, we always need
769.591	to return back to nature.
774.999	By now, you know that a 3D printer
774.999	prints material in layers.
779.759	You also know that nature doesn't.
782.182	It grows. It adds with sophistication.
786.102	This silkworm cocoon, for example,
788.69	creates a highly
788.69	sophisticated architecture,
792.034	a home inside which to metamorphisize.
794.859	No additive manufacturing today gets even
794.859	close to this level of sophistication.
800.535	It does so by combining not two materials,
803.631	but two proteins
803.631	in different concentrations.
807.487	One acts as the structure,
807.487	the other is the glue, or the matrix,
811.507	holding those fibers together.
813.952	And this happens across scales.
816.717	The silkworm first attaches itself
816.717	to the environment --
819.473	it creates a tensile structure --
821.513	and it then starts spinning
821.513	a compressive cocoon.
824.999	Tension and compression,
824.999	the two forces of life,
828.554	manifested in a single material.
833.337	In order to better understand
833.337	how this complex process works,
836.572	we glued a tiny earth magnet
838.783	to the head of a silkworm,
838.783	to the spinneret.
841.806	We placed it inside a box
841.806	with magnetic sensors,
844.778	and that allowed us to create
844.778	this 3-dimensional point cloud
847.889	and visualize the complex architecture
847.889	of the silkworm cocoon.
853.736	However, when we placed
853.736	the silkworm on a flat patch,
857.414	not inside a box,
859.176	we realized it would spin a flat cocoon
862.391	and it would still
862.391	healthily metamorphisize.
865.781	So we started designing different
865.781	environments, different scaffolds,
869.79	and we discovered that
869.79	the shape, the composition,
872.549	the structure of the cocoon, was directly
872.549	informed by the environment.
876.866	Silkworms are often boiled to death
876.866	inside their cocoons,
881.243	their silk unraveled and used
881.243	in the textile industry.
884.933	We realized that designing these templates
884.933	allowed us to give shape to raw silk
891.416	without boiling a single cocoon.
894.95	(Applause)
898.217	They would healthily metamorphisize,
900.963	and we would be able
900.963	to create these things.
903.517	So we scaled this process up
903.517	to architectural scale.
907.17	We had a robot spin
907.17	the template out of silk,
910.325	and we placed it on our site.
912.489	We knew silkworms migrated
912.489	toward darker and colder areas,
917.397	so we used a sun path diagram
917.397	to reveal the distribution
920.741	of light and heat on our structure.
923.692	We then created holes, or apertures,
926.226	that would lock in the rays
926.226	of light and heat,
929.999	distributing those silkworms
929.999	on the structure.
934.777	We were ready to receive the caterpillars.
937.174	We ordered 6,500 silkworms
937.174	from an online silk farm.
942.031	And after four weeks of feeding,
942.031	they were ready to spin with us.
945.983	We placed them carefully
945.983	at the bottom rim of the scaffold,
949.539	and as they spin they pupate,
949.539	they mate, they lay eggs,
953.999	and life begins all over again --
953.999	just like us but much, much shorter.
960.3	Bucky Fuller said that tension
960.3	is the great integrity,
965.069	and he was right.
966.716	As they spin biological silk
966.716	over robotically spun silk,
970.462	they give this entire
970.462	pavilion its integrity.
973.15	And over two to three weeks,
975.024	6,500 silkworms spin 6,500 kilometers.
979.703	In a curious symmetry, this is also
979.703	the length of the Silk Road.
984.837	The moths, after they hatch,
984.837	produce 1.5 million eggs.
988.716	This could be used for 250
988.716	additional pavilions for the future.
993.639	So here they are, the two worldviews.
996.728	One spins silk out of a robotic arm,
1000.519	the other fills in the gaps.
1004.182	If the final frontier of design
1004.182	is to breathe life into the products
1007.987	and the buildings around us,
1009.805	to form a two-material ecology,
1011.999	then designers must unite
1011.999	these two worldviews.
1015.627	Which brings us back, of course,
1015.627	to the beginning.
1020.121	Here's to a new age of design,
1020.121	a new age of creation,
1023.748	that takes us from
1023.748	a nature-inspired design
1027.12	to a design-inspired nature,
1029.999	and that demands of us for the first time
1033.999	that we mother nature.
1038.793	Thank you.
1039.851	(Applause)
1046.871	Thank you very much. Thank you.
1048.999	(Applause)
