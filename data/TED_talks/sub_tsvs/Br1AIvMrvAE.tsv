12.872	I'd like to start, if I may,
14.416	with the story of the Paisley snail.
17.14	On the evening of the 26th of August, 1928,
20.355	May Donoghue took a train from Glasgow
22.729	to the town of Paisley, seven miles east of the city,
25.26	and there at the Wellmeadow Caf√©,
27.573	she had a Scots ice cream float,
30.699	a mix of ice cream and ginger beer
32.546	bought for her by a friend.
34.501	The ginger beer came in a brown, opaque bottle
36.902	"labeled ""D. Stevenson, Glen Lane, Paisley."""
40.765	She drank some of the ice cream float,
42.841	but as the remaining ginger beer was poured
44.675	into her tumbler,
46.071	a decomposed snail
48.524	floated to the surface of her glass.
51.106	Three days later, she was admitted
52.65	to the Glasgow Royal Infirmary
54.156	and diagnosed with severe gastroenteritis
56.214	and shock.
58.167	The case of Donoghue vs. Stevenson that followed
61.435	set a very important legal precedent:
64.08	Stevenson, the manufacturer of the ginger beer,
65.811	was held to have a clear duty of care
68.588	towards May Donoghue,
70.036	even though there was no contract between them,
72.138	and, indeed, she hadn't even bought the drink.
74.955	One of the judges, Lord Atkin, described it like this:
77.974	You must take care to avoid acts or omissions
80.884	which you can reasonably foresee
82.952	would be likely to injure your neighbor.
86.18	Indeed, one wonders that without a duty of care,
88.523	how many people would have had to suffer
90.269	from gastroenteritis before Stevenson
90.269	eventually went out of business.
93.993	Now please hang on to that Paisley snail story,
96.374	because it's an important principle.
99.607	Last year, the Hansard Society,
99.607	a nonpartisan charity
102.101	which seeks to strengthen parliamentary democracy
104.007	and encourage greater public involvement in politics
107.244	published, alongside their annual audit
109.831	of political engagement, an additional section
112.704	devoted entirely to politics and the media.
115.827	Here are a couple of rather depressing observations
118.202	from that survey.
120.21	Tabloid newspapers do not appear
122.375	to advance the political citizenship of their readers,
125.208	relative even to those
126.781	who read no newspapers whatsoever.
130.007	Tabloid-only readers are twice as likely to agree
132.999	with a negative view of politics
134.85	than readers of no newspapers.
137.425	They're not just less politically engaged.
139.418	They are consuming media that reinforces
141.866	their negative evaluation of politics,
143.828	thereby contributing to a fatalistic and cynical
146.931	attitude to democracy and their own role within it.
150.266	Little wonder that the report concluded that
152.426	in this respect, the press, particularly the tabloids,
155.616	appear not to be living up to the importance
157.955	of their role in our democracy.
160.591	Now I doubt if anyone in this room would seriously
162.65	challenge that view.
164.097	But if Hansard are right, and they usually are,
166.713	then we've got a very serious problem on our hands,
168.689	and it's one that I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes
171.324	focusing upon.
173.353	Since the Paisley snail,
175.036	and especially over the past decade or so,
177.5	a great deal of thinking has been developed
179.419	around the notion of a duty of care
181.278	as it relates to a number of aspects of civil society.
183.817	Generally a duty of care arises when one individual
186.561	or a group of individuals undertakes an activity
189.295	which has the potential to cause harm to another,
191.825	either physically, mentally or economically.
194.539	This is principally focused on obvious areas,
197.01	such as our empathetic response
197.01	to children and young people,
200.052	to our service personnel, and
200.052	to the elderly and infirm.
202.778	It is seldom, if ever, extended
202.778	to equally important arguments
206.971	around the fragility of our
206.971	present system of government,
211.221	to the notion that honesty, accuracy and impartiality
214.73	are fundamental to the process of building
216.874	and embedding an informed,
218.603	participatory democracy.
221.36	And the more you think about it,
222.781	the stranger that is.
224.612	A couple of years ago, I had the pleasure
226.074	of opening a brand new school
227.828	in the northeast of England.
229.399	It had been renamed by its pupils as Academy 360.
232.938	As I walked through their impressive,
234.79	glass-covered atrium,
236.165	in front of me, emblazoned on the wall
237.983	in letters of fire
239.531	was Marcus Aurelius's famous injunction:
242.632	If it's not true, don't say it;
245.487	if it's not right, don't do it.
248.57	The head teacher saw me staring at it,
250.558	"and he said, ""Oh, that's our school motto."""
253.35	On the train back to London,
255.077	I couldn't get it out of my mind.
256.931	I kept thinking, can it really have taken us
259.49	over 2,000 years to come to terms
261.701	with that simple notion
263.566	as being our minimum expectation of each other?
266.518	Isn't it time that we develop this concept
269.126	of a duty of care
270.795	and extended it to include a care
273.221	for our shared but increasingly
273.221	endangered democratic values?
276.485	After all, the absence of a duty of care
278.342	within many professions
279.932	can all too easily amount to
279.932	accusations of negligence,
282.435	and that being the case, can we be
282.435	really comfortable with the thought
285.542	that we're in effect being negligent
287.843	in respect of the health of our own societies
290.634	and the values that necessarily underpin them?
293.369	Could anyone honestly suggest, on the evidence,
296.364	that the same media which
296.364	Hansard so roundly condemned
299.62	have taken sufficient care to avoid behaving
302.907	in ways which they could reasonably have foreseen
306.349	would be likely to undermine or even damage
308.45	our inherently fragile democratic settlement.
311.284	Now there will be those who will argue
313.305	that this could all too easily drift into a form
315.078	of censorship, albeit self-censorship,
317.085	but I don't buy that argument.
319.041	It has to be possible
321.1	to balance freedom of expression
323.2	with wider moral and social responsibilities.
326.407	Let me explain why by taking the example
328.258	from my own career as a filmmaker.
331.161	Throughout that career, I never accepted
332.968	that a filmmaker should set about putting
334.595	their own work outside or above what he or she
337.645	believed to be a decent set of values
339.595	for their own life, their own family,
342.944	and the future of the society in which we all live.
346.535	I'd go further.
347.859	A responsible filmmaker should
347.859	never devalue their work
351.153	to a point at which it becomes less than true
353.197	to the world they themselves wish to inhabit.
356.637	As I see it, filmmakers, journalists, even bloggers
360.023	are all required to face up to the social expectations
362.547	that come with combining the
362.547	intrinsic power of their medium
366.302	with their well-honed professional skills.
369.676	Obviously this is not a mandated duty,
372.563	but for the gifted filmmaker
372.563	and the responsible journalist
375.045	or even blogger, it strikes me
375.045	as being utterly inescapable.
378.865	We should always remember that our notion
381.464	of individual freedom and
381.464	its partner, creative freedom,
384.355	is comparatively new
386.15	in the history of Western ideas,
388.412	and for that reason, it's often undervalued
390.33	and can be very quickly undermined.
392.693	It's a prize easily lost,
394.92	and once lost, once surrendered,
396.683	it can prove very, very hard to reclaim.
400	And its first line of defense
401.525	has to be our own standards,
403.876	not those enforced on us by a censor or legislation,
407.615	our own standards and our own integrity.
409.438	Our integrity as we deal with those
411.432	with whom we work
412.98	and our own standards as we operate within society.
416.605	And these standards of ours
418.075	need to be all of a piece with
418.075	a sustainable social agenda.
421.34	They're part of a collective responsibility,
423.453	the responsibility of the artist or the journalist
425.583	to deal with the world as it really is,
427.957	and this, in turn, must go hand in hand
430.406	with the responsibility of those governing society
432.824	to also face up to that world,
434.901	and not to be tempted to misappropriate
437.276	the causes of its ills.
439.853	Yet, as has become strikingly clear
442.499	over the last couple of years,
444.567	such responsibility has to a very great extent
446.601	been abrogated by large sections of the media.
449.644	And as a consequence, across the Western world,
451.584	the over-simplistic policies of the parties of protest
454.883	and their appeal to a largely disillusioned,
457.268	older demographic,
458.657	along with the apathy and obsession with the trivial
460.865	that typifies at least some of the young,
462.763	taken together, these and other similarly
464.821	contemporary aberrations
466.902	are threatening to squeeze the life
468.949	out of active, informed debate and engagement,
472.523	and I stress active.
475.05	The most ardent of libertarians might argue
477.327	that Donoghue v. Stevenson should
477.327	have been thrown out of court
480.321	and that Stevenson would eventually
480.321	have gone out of business
482.439	if he'd continued to sell ginger beer with snails in it.
485.856	But most of us, I think, accept some small role
489.27	for the state to enforce a duty of care,
492.348	and the key word here is reasonable.
495.02	Judges must ask, did they take reasonable care
498.6	and could they have reasonably foreseen
500.015	the consequences of their actions?
502.213	Far from signifying overbearing state power,
505.195	it's that small common sense test of reasonableness
508.72	that I'd like us to apply to those in the media
511.379	who, after all, set the tone and the content
513.65	for much of our democratic discourse.
516.967	Democracy, in order to work, requires that
519.687	reasonable men and women take
519.687	the time to understand and debate
522.635	difficult, sometimes complex issues,
524.967	and they do so in an atmosphere which strives
527.26	for the type of understanding that leads to,
529.659	if not agreement, then at least a productive
531.726	and workable compromise.
534.093	Politics is about choices,
536.45	and within those choices, politics is about priorities.
540.441	It's about reconciling conflicting preferences
542.979	wherever and whenever possibly based on fact.
548.195	But if the facts themselves are distorted,
550.666	the resolutions are likely only
550.666	to create further conflict,
554.389	with all the stresses and strains on society
556.276	that inevitably follow.
558.492	The media have to decide:
560.439	Do they see their role as being to inflame
563.613	or to inform?
565.943	Because in the end, it comes down to a combination
568.805	of trust and leadership.
571.296	Fifty years ago this week,
571.296	President John F. Kennedy
573.873	made two epoch-making speeches,
575.479	the first on disarmament
575.479	and the second on civil rights.
578.976	The first led almost immediately
581.078	to the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty,
582.659	and the second led to the 1964 Civil Rights Act,
585.724	both of which represented giant leaps forward.
589.31	Democracy, well-led and well-informed,
591.715	can achieve very great things,
594.208	but there's a precondition.
595.881	We have to trust that those making those decisions
599.192	are acting in the best interest not of themselves
601.659	but of the whole of the people.
603.423	We need factually-based options,
606.502	clearly laid out,
607.741	not those of a few powerful
609.139	and potentially manipulative corporations
611.236	pursuing their own frequently narrow agendas,
613.603	but accurate, unprejudiced information
616.032	with which to make our own judgments.
618.408	If we want to provide decent, fulfilling lives
620.302	for our children and our children's children,
622.613	we need to exercise to the
622.613	very greatest degree possible
625.73	that duty of care for a vibrant,
627.442	and hopefully a lasting, democracy.
630.339	Thank you very much for listening to me.
632.422	(Applause)
