15.427	Recently I visited Beloit, Wisconsin.
18.441	And I was there to honor a great 20th century explorer,
22.089	Roy Chapman Andrews.
24.131	During his time at the American Museum of Natural History,
26.975	Andrews led a range of expeditions to uncharted regions,
31.075	like here in the Gobi Desert.
32.81	He was quite a figure.
34.218	He was later, it's said, the basis of the Indiana Jones character.
37.892	And when I was in Beloit, Wisconsin,
40.089	I gave a public lecture to a group of middle school students.
44.222	And I'm here to tell you,
45.791	if there's anything more intimidating than talking here at TED,
48.495	it'll be trying to hold the attention
50.327	of a group of a thousand 12-year-olds for a 45-minute lecture.
54.22	Don't try that one.
56.099	At the end of the lecture they asked a number of questions,
59.641	but there was one that's really stuck with me since then.
62.943	There was a young girl who stood up,
64.86	and she asked the question:
66.191	"""Where should we explore?"""
68.239	I think there's a sense that many of us have
70.37	that the great age of exploration on Earth is over,
73.189	that for the next generation
74.721	they're going to have to go to outer space or the deepest oceans
78.139	in order to find something significant to explore.
80.689	But is that really the case?
83.189	Is there really nowhere significant for us to explore
86.185	left here on Earth?
87.91	It sort of made me think back
89.093	to one of my favorite explorers in the history of biology.
91.843	This is an explorer of the unseen world, Martinus Beijerinck.
95.177	So Beijerinck set out to discover the cause
97.635	of tobacco mosaic disease.
100	What he did is he took the infected juice from tobacco plants
103.552	and he would filter it through smaller and smaller filters.
106.489	And he reached the point
108.055	where he felt that there must be something out there
111.066	that was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known --
114.51	bacteria, at the time.
116.554	He came up with a name for his mystery agent.
119.942	He called it the virus --
121.968	"Latin for ""poison."""
124.243	And in uncovering viruses,
127.02	Beijerinck really opened this entirely new world for us.
130.641	We now know that viruses make up the majority
132.635	of the genetic information on our planet,
134.927	more than the genetic information
136.593	of all other forms of life combined.
138.343	And obviously there's been tremendous practical applications
141.437	associated with this world --
142.691	things like the eradication of smallpox,
145.093	the advent of a vaccine against cervical cancer,
148.748	which we now know is mostly caused by human papillomavirus.
152.347	And Beijerinck's discovery,
154.02	this was not something that occurred 500 years ago.
156.741	It was a little over 100 years ago
159.42	that Beijerinck discovered viruses.
161.84	So basically we had automobiles,
163.727	but we were unaware of the forms of life
165.97	that make up most of the genetic information on our planet.
168.976	We now have these amazing tools
171.158	to allow us to explore the unseen world --
173.468	things like deep sequencing,
175.481	which allow us to do much more than just skim the surface
179.045	and look at individual genomes from a particular species,
182.135	but to look at entire metagenomes,
184.63	the communities of teeming microorganisms in, on and around us
188.81	and to document all of the genetic information in these species.
192.331	We can apply these techniques
193.802	to things from soil to skin and everything in between.
198.312	In my organization we now do this on a regular basis
201.302	to identify the causes of outbreaks
203.681	that are unclear exactly what causes them.
206.97	And just to give you a sense of how this works,
209.302	imagine that we took a nasal swab from every single one of you.
212.302	And this is something we commonly do
213.664	to look for respiratory viruses like influenza.
216.658	The first thing we would see
218.51	is a tremendous amount of genetic information.
221.56	And if we started looking into that genetic information,
223.968	we'd see a number of usual suspects out there --
226.303	of course, a lot of human genetic information,
228.096	but also bacterial and viral information,
230.968	mostly from things that are completely harmless within your nose.
234.135	But we'd also see something very, very surprising.
237.047	As we started to look at this information,
239.122	we would see that about 20 percent of the genetic information in your nose
243.468	doesn't match anything that we've ever seen before --
246.385	no plant, animal, fungus, virus or bacteria.
249.556	Basically we have no clue what this is.
253.06	And for the small group of us who actually study this kind of data,
257.18	a few of us have actually begun to call this information
260.895	biological dark matter.
263.297	We know it's not anything that we've seen before;
266.245	it's sort of the equivalent of an uncharted continent
269.352	right within our own genetic information.
272.07	And there's a lot of it.
273.447	If you think 20 percent of genetic information in your nose is a lot
276.933	of biological dark matter,
278.552	if we looked at your gut,
280.302	up to 40 or 50 percent of that information is biological dark matter.
283.998	And even in the relatively sterile blood,
286.237	around one to two percent of this information is dark matter --
289.218	can't be classified, can't be typed or matched with anything we've seen before.
293.966	At first we thought that perhaps this was artifact.
296.593	These deep sequencing tools are relatively new.
299.845	But as they become more and more accurate,
301.918	we've determined that this information is a form of life,
305.506	or at least some of it is a form of life.
308.093	And while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter
312.458	are really only in their infancy,
314.396	there's a very, very exciting possibility that exists:
318.073	that buried in this life, in this genetic information,
321.552	are signatures of as of yet unidentified life.
326.04	That as we explore these strings of A's, T's, C's and G's,
329.975	we may uncover a completely new class of life
333.31	that, like Beijerinck, will fundamentally change
335.722	the way that we think about the nature of biology.
337.918	That perhaps will allow us to identify the cause of a cancer that afflicts us
342.347	or identify the source of an outbreak that we aren't familiar with
345.879	or perhaps create a new tool in molecular biology.
348.773	I'm pleased to announce that,
350.458	along with colleagues at Stanford and Caltech and UCSF,
355.4	we're currently starting an initiative
357.039	to explore biological dark matter for the existence of new forms of life.
361.012	A little over a hundred years ago,
363.156	people were unaware of viruses,
365.86	the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet.
370.099	A hundred years from now, people may marvel
372.681	that we were perhaps completely unaware of a new class of life
376.135	that literally was right under our noses.
379.439	It's true, we may have charted all the continents on the planet
382.762	and we may have discovered all the mammals that are out there,
385.843	but that doesn't mean that there's nothing left to explore on Earth.
389.399	Beijerinck and his kind
391.404	provide an important lesson for the next generation of explorers --
395.091	people like that young girl from Beloit, Wisconsin.
398.423	And I think if we phrase that lesson, it's something like this:
402.218	Don't assume that what we currently think is out there is the full story.
406.447	Go after the dark matter in whatever field you choose to explore.
411.51	There are unknowns all around us
413.629	and they're just waiting to be discovered.
416.01	Thank you.
417.679	(Applause)
