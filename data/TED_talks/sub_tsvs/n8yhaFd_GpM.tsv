12.584	Eight years ago, I was haunted
12.584	by an evil spirit.
20.106	I was 25 at the time,
22.33	and I was living in a tiny house
22.33	behind someone else's house
26.792	in Los Angeles.
28.111	It was this guest house,
28.111	it had kind of been dilapidated,
31.787	not taken care of for a long time.
34.49	And one night, I was sitting there
37.965	and I got this really spooky feeling,
42.491	kind of the feeling
42.491	like you're being watched.
45.533	But no one was there except my two dogs,
48.576	and they were just chewing their feet.
51.128	And I looked around. No one was there.
54.985	And I thought, OK,
54.985	it's just my imagination.
59.23	But the feeling just kept getting worse,
61.865	and I started to feel
61.865	this pressure in my chest,
67.181	sort of like the feeling
67.181	when you get bad news.
70.297	But it started to sink lower and lower
73.632	and almost hurt.
75.87	And over the course of that week,
75.87	this feeling got worse and worse,
79.628	and I started to become convinced
79.628	that something was there
85.148	in my little guest house, haunting me.
89.843	And I started to hear these sounds,
92.982	"this ""whoosh,"" kind of whisper,"
92.982	like something passing through me.
100.305	I called my best friend, Claire, and said,
105.398	"""I know this is going to sound crazy,"
108.581	but, um ...
110.669	I think there's a ghost in my house,
110.669	"and I need to get rid of it."""
115.672	And she said -- she's very
115.672	open-minded -- and she said,
120.044	"""I don't think you're crazy."
121.573	I think you just need
121.573	"to do a cleansing ritual."""
125.471	(Laughter)
127.276	"""So get some sage and burn it,"
132.725	"and tell it to go away."""
135.247	"So I said, ""OK,"""
135.247	and I went and I bought sage.
138.933	I had never done this before,
138.933	so I set the sage on fire,
143.018	"waved it about, and said, ""Go away!"
143.018	This is my house! I live here.
149.742	"You don't live here!"""
152.413	But the feeling stayed.
152.413	Nothing got better.
155.718	And then I started to think,
157.938	OK, well now this thing is probably
157.938	just laughing at me,
160.734	because it hasn't left,
163.186	and I probably just look like
163.186	this impotent, powerless thing
166.435	that couldn't get it to go away.
168.694	So every day I'd come home
172.643	and you guys, this feeling got so bad
172.643	that -- I mean, I'm laughing at it now --
178.183	but I would sit there in bed
178.183	and cry every night.
182.86	And the feeling on my chest
182.86	got worse and worse.
188.183	It was physically painful.
191.199	And I even went to a psychiatrist
194.645	and tried to get her
194.645	to prescribe me medicine,
198.097	and she wouldn't just because
198.097	I don't have schizophrenia, OK.
202.223	(Laughter)
205.757	So finally I got on the internet,
205.757	"and I Googled ""hauntings."""
212.581	And I came upon this forum
212.581	of ghost hunters.
215.691	But these were a special
215.691	kind of ghost hunters --
218.047	they were skeptics.
219.615	They believed that every case of ghosts
219.615	that they had investigated so far
225.209	had been explained away by science.
227.408	"And I was like, ""OK, smart guys,"
227.408	this is what's happening to me,
231.376	and if you have an explanation for me,
231.376	"I would love to hear it."""
235.475	"And one of them said, ""OK."
238.709	Um, have you heard
238.709	"of carbon monoxide poisoning?"""
244.697	"And I said, ""Yeah."
249.183	"Like, gas poisoning?"""
252.554	Carbon monoxide poisoning
252.554	is when you have a gas leak
255.557	leaking into your home.
257.024	I looked it up, and the symptoms
257.024	of carbon monoxide poisoning
262.876	include a pressure on your chest,
266.03	auditory hallucinations -- whoosh --
270.452	and an unexplained feeling of dread.
275.651	So that night, I called the gas company.
278.077	"I said, ""I have an emergency."
278.077	I need you to come out.
281.906	I don't want to get into the story now,
281.906	"but I need you to come out."""
285.2	(Laughter)
286.417	They came out. I said,
286.417	"""I suspect a gas leak."""
289.228	They brought their carbon
289.228	monoxide detector,
291.768	and the man said,
293.834	"""It's a really good thing"
293.834	that you called us tonight,
297.321	because you could have been
297.321	"dead very soon."""
301.487	Thirty-seven percent of Americans
301.487	believe in haunted houses,
306.878	and I wonder how many of them
306.878	have been in one
311.492	and how many of them have been in danger.
316.603	So that haunting story
316.603	has led me to my job.
321.36	I'm an investigator, and I'm
321.36	an investigator in two senses:
324.282	I'm an investigative journalist,
325.874	and I'm also an investigator
325.874	of the claims of the paranormal
329.084	and claims of the spiritual.
331.104	And that means a few things.
332.636	Sometimes that means that I'm pretending
332.636	to need an exorcism
336.611	so I can get -- yes, that's right! --
336.611	so I can go to an exorcist
341.2	and see if he's using gimmicks
341.2	or psychological tricks
344.83	to try to convince someone
344.83	that they're possessed.
347.742	Sometimes that means
347.742	I'm going undercover in a fringe group
351.088	which I report on
351.088	for a podcast that I co-host.
354.485	And I've done over 70 investigations
354.485	like this with my co-host, Ross.
359.543	I would love to tell you
359.543	that nine times out of 10, science wins,
364.563	saves the day, it's all explained.
367.083	That's not true.
368.276	The truth is, 10 times out of 10,
368.276	science wins, it saves the day.
374.516	(Applause)
386.847	And that doesn't mean
386.847	there's no such thing as a mystery.
389.552	Of course there are mysteries,
389.552	but a mystery is a mystery.
393.502	It is not a ghost.
396.286	Now, I believe there are
396.286	two kinds of truth,
399.931	and it's taken me a while to get
399.931	to this place, but I think this is right,
404.306	so hear me out.
405.594	I think there is outer truth
405.594	and there's inner truth.
408.773	So if you say to me,
412.012	"""There was a man named Jesus"
412.012	"and he once existed,"""
414.709	that's outer truth, right?
416.43	And we can go and look
416.43	at the historical record.
418.804	We can determine
418.804	whether that seems to be true.
421.239	And I would argue,
421.239	it does seem to be true.
423.802	"If you say, ""Jesus rose"
423.802	"from the dead,"" -- ooh, trickier."
429.497	(Laughter)
432.261	I would say that's an outer-truth claim,
439.224	because he physically rose or he didn't.
441.286	I'm not going to get into
441.286	whether he rose or he didn't,
444.036	but I would say
444.036	that's an outer-truth claim.
446.138	It happened or it didn't happen.
447.856	"But if you say, ""I don't care"
447.856	whether he rose from the dead.
451.582	It's symbolically important to me,
453.95	and that metaphor is so meaningful,
453.95	so purposeful to me,
457.468	and I'm not going to try
457.468	"to persuade you of it,"""
459.795	now you've moved it
459.795	from outer truth to inner truth,
462.374	from science to art.
463.92	And I think we have a tendency
463.92	to not be clear about this,
467.108	to try to move our inner truths
467.108	to outer truths,
470.544	or to not be fair about it to each other,
473.471	and when people are telling us
473.471	their inner truths,
475.859	to try to make them defend them
475.859	by outer-truth standards.
479.494	So I'm talking here about outer truth,
479.494	about objective things.
483.034	And there was an objective reality
483.034	in my haunted house, right?
488.744	Now that I've told you about the gas leak,
490.817	I doubt a single person here
490.817	would be like,
492.861	"""I still think there was a ghost, too"" --"
494.859	(Laughter)
495.923	because as soon as we have
495.923	these scientific explanations,
498.694	we know to give up the ghost.
500.38	We use these things as stopgaps
500.38	for things that we can't explain.
504.414	We don't believe them because of evidence;
506.439	we believe them because
506.439	of a lack of evidence.
510.202	So there is a group in Los Angeles
512.59	called the Independent
512.59	Investigations Group, or the IIG,
516.322	and they do great work.
518.326	They'll give a $10,000 prize
521.053	to anyone who can show,
521.053	under scientific conditions,
525.604	that they have a paranormal ability.
527.983	No one's done it yet,
529.713	but they've had a couple people
529.713	who claim that they were clairaudients,
534.795	which means that they can hear voices
534.795	either from the great beyond
538.875	or they can read minds.
540.797	And they had one person
540.797	who was very sincere,
543.581	who believed that he could read minds.
546.565	So they set up a test with him,
546.565	and this is the way it always works.
552.576	"The group says, ""OK, we have a protocol,"
554.846	we have a way to scientifically test this.
556.885	"Do you agree with it?"""
558.062	The person says yes. Then they test it.
559.982	It's very important that both sides agree.
562.011	They did that, they tested him.
564.45	"They said, ""OK, you know what?"
567.028	You weren't able to predict
567.028	what Lisa was thinking.
570.894	It matched up about the same as chance.
572.947	"Looks like you don't have the power."""
574.813	And that gave them the opportunity
576.687	to compassionately sit down with him
576.687	and have a very difficult discussion,
581.98	which basically amounted to,
583.973	"""Hey, we know you're sincere,"
583.973	and what that means is,
588.56	"you do hear something in your head."""
590.917	And that guy got to make
590.917	the very difficult decision,
595.583	but really the life-changing decision
595.583	about whether to go get help.
601.728	We're actually helping people
601.728	to make these connections
606.795	that maybe before seemed like
606.795	otherworldly explanations,
612.129	help draw us into reality
612.129	and maybe change our lives for the better.
618.293	Now, on the other hand,
618.293	maybe one time it'll turn out to be true.
624.708	Maybe we'll find out there are ghosts,
626.755	and holy shit, it will be the best thing!
628.952	And every time I do
628.952	one of these investigations,
631.7	I still get so excited,
633.53	and I'm like 75 into them,
635.617	and still I swear on number 76,
635.617	"I'm going to be like, ""This is the one!"""
639.718	(Laughter)
640.947	Maybe I'm just eternally optimistic,
640.947	but I hope I never lose this hope,
645.827	and I invite you to take
645.827	this same attitude
649.626	when people share
649.626	their outer beliefs with you.
652.093	When talking about testable claims,
654.584	respect them enough to ask
654.584	these good questions.
658.287	Challenge and see
658.287	how you can examine them together,
661.173	because there's this idea
661.173	that you can't respect a belief
665.366	and still challenge it,
665.366	but that's not true.
667.94	When we jiggle the lock,
667.94	when we test the claim,
670.711	we're saying, OK, I respect you,
670.711	I'm listening to what you're saying,
674.707	I'm going to test it out with you.
676.723	We've all had that experience
676.723	where you're telling someone something,
680.102	"and they're like, ""Oh,"
680.102	"that's really interesting, yeah,"""
682.857	you know you're being had.
685.004	"But when someone says, ""Really? Huh."
689.413	Sounds a little sketchy to me,
689.413	"but I'm listening,"""
691.827	you at least know
691.827	you're being engaged and respected.
694.508	And that's the kind of attitude
694.508	we should have with these claims.
697.648	That's showing someone
697.648	that you care what they're saying.
700.379	That's respect.
706.03	Now, yes, most of these searches
706.03	will come up empty,
710.753	but that's how all of science works.
712.983	Every cure for cancer so far
712.983	has not panned out,
717.108	but we don't stop looking,
719.464	for two reasons.
721.018	Because number one, the answer matters.
723.52	Whether it's looking at the afterlife
723.52	or the paranormal or the cure for cancer,
727.566	it all amounts to the same question:
729.923	How long will we be here?
733.785	And two, because looking for the truth,
737.593	being open-minded,
738.926	and being willing to be wrong
738.926	and to change your whole worldview
743.319	is awe-inspiring.
746.138	I still get excited at ghost stories
746.138	every single time.
749.975	I still consider that every group
749.975	I join might be right,
753.083	and I hope I never lose that hope.
755.104	Let's all never lose that hope,
756.932	because searching for what's out there
759.811	helps us understand what's in here.
762.457	And also, please have
762.457	a carbon monoxide detector in your home.
769.982	Thank you.
771.285	(Applause)
