16.26	So this is a story
18.26	of a place that I now call home.
20.26	It's a story of public education
23.26	and of rural communities
25.26	and of what design might do to improve both.
28.26	So this is Bertie County,
30.26	North Carolina, USA.
32.26	"To give you an idea of the ""where:"""
34.26	So here's North Carolina, and if we zoom in,
36.26	Bertie County is in the eastern part of the state.
39.26	It's about two hours east
41.26	driving-time from Raleigh.
43.26	And it's very flat. It's very swampy.
45.26	It's mostly farmland.
47.26	The entire county
49.26	is home to just 20,000 people, and they're very sparsely distributed.
52.26	So there's only 27 people per square mile,
54.26	which comes down to about 10 people
56.26	per square kilometer.
58.26	Bertie County is kind of a prime example
61.26	in the demise of rural America.
63.26	We've seen this story all over the country
66.26	and even in places beyond the American borders.
69.26	We know the symptoms.
71.26	It's the hollowing out of small towns.
73.26	It's downtowns becoming ghost towns.
75.26	The brain drain --
77.26	where all of the most educated and qualified leave and never come back.
80.26	It's the dependence on farm subsidies
82.26	and under-performing schools
84.26	and higher poverty rates in rural areas
86.26	than in urban.
88.26	And Bertie County is no exception to this.
90.26	Perhaps the biggest thing it struggles with,
92.26	like many communities similar to it,
94.26	is that there's no
96.26	shared, collective investment
98.26	in the future of rural communities.
100.26	Only 6.8 percent of all our philanthropic giving in the U.S. right now
103.26	benefits rural communities,
105.26	and yet 20 percent of our population lives there.
108.26	So Bertie County is not only very rural; it's incredibly poor.
111.26	It is the poorest county in the state.
113.26	It has one in three of its children living in poverty,
116.26	"and it's what is referred to as a ""rural ghetto."""
119.26	The economy is mostly agricultural.
122.26	The biggest crops are cotton and tobacco,
124.26	and we're very proud of our Bertie County peanut.
127.26	The biggest employer is the Purdue chicken processing plant.
130.26	The county seat is Windsor.
132.26	This is like Times Square of Windsor that you're looking at right now.
135.26	It's home to only 2,000 people,
137.26	and like a lot of other small towns
139.26	it has been hollowed out over the years.
141.26	There are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair
144.26	than occupied and in use.
146.26	You can count the number of restaurants in the county
148.26	on one hand --
150.26	Bunn's Barbecue being my absolute favorite.
152.26	But in the whole county there is no coffee shop,
154.26	there's no Internet cafe,
156.26	there's no movie theater, there's no bookstore.
158.26	There isn't even a Walmart.
160.26	Racially, the county
162.26	is about 60 percent African-American,
164.26	but what happens in the public schools
166.26	is most of the privileged white kids
168.26	go to the private Lawrence Academy.
170.26	So the public school students
172.26	are about 86 percent African-American.
174.26	And this is a spread from the local newspaper of the recent graduating class,
177.26	and you can see the difference is pretty stark.
180.26	So to say that the public education system
182.26	in Bertie County is struggling
184.26	would be a huge understatement.
186.26	There's basically no pool
188.26	of qualified teachers to pull from,
190.26	and only eight percent of the people in the county
192.26	have a bachelor's degree or higher.
194.26	So there isn't a big legacy
196.26	in the pride of education.
198.26	In fact, two years ago,
200.26	only 27 percent of all the third- through eighth-graders
202.26	were passing the state standard
204.26	in both English and math.
207.26	So it sounds like I'm painting a really bleak picture of this place,
210.26	but I promise there is good news.
213.26	The biggest asset, in my opinion,
215.26	one of the biggest assets in Bertie County right now is this man:
217.26	This is Dr. Chip Zullinger,
219.26	fondly known as Dr. Z.
222.26	He was brought in in October 2007
224.26	as the new superintendent
226.26	to basically fix this broken school system.
228.26	And he previously was a superintendent
230.26	in Charleston, South Carolina
232.26	and then in Denver, Colorado.
234.26	He started some of the country's first charter schools
236.26	in the late '80s in the U.S.
239.26	And he is an absolute renegade and a visionary,
241.26	and he is the reason that I now live and work there.
246.26	So in February of 2009,
248.26	Dr. Zullinger invited us, Project H Design --
251.26	which is a non-profit design firm that I founded --
253.26	to come to Bertie and to partner with him
255.26	on the repair of this school district
257.26	and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district.
260.26	And he invited us in particular
262.26	because we have a very specific
264.26	type of design process --
266.26	one that results in appropriate design solutions
269.26	in places that don't usually have access
271.26	to design services or creative capital.
273.26	Specifically, we use these six design directives,
276.26	probably the most important being number two:
278.26	we design with, not for --
280.26	in that, when we're doing humanitarian-focused design,
283.26	it's not about designing for clients anymore.
286.26	It's about designing with people,
288.26	and letting appropriate solutions emerge from within.
291.26	So at the time of being invited down there,
293.26	we were based in San Francisco,
295.26	and so we were going back and forth
297.26	for basically the rest of 2009,
299.26	spending about half our time in Bertie County.
301.26	And when I say we, I mean Project H,
303.26	but more specifically, I mean myself and my partner, Matthew Miller,
306.26	who's an architect and a sort of MacGyver-type builder.
310.26	So fast-forward to today, and we now live there.
313.26	I have strategically cut Matt's head out of this photo,
315.26	because he would kill me if he knew I was using it
317.26	because of the sweatsuits.
319.26	But this is our front porch. We live there.
321.26	We now call this place home.
323.26	Over the course of this year that we spent flying back and forth,
326.26	we realized we had fallen in love with the place.
328.26	We had fallen in love with the place and the people
331.26	and the work that we're able to do
333.26	in a rural place like Bertie County,
335.26	that, as designers and builders,
337.26	you can't do everywhere.
339.26	There's space to experiment
341.26	and to weld and to test things.
343.26	We have an amazing advocate in Dr. Zullinger.
346.26	There's a nobility of real, hands-on,
349.26	dirt-under-your-fingernails work.
351.26	But beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there,
353.26	there is a huge need.
355.26	There is a total vacuum of creative capital in Bertie County.
358.26	There isn't a single licensed architect in the whole county.
361.26	And so we saw an opportunity
363.26	to bring design as this untouched tool,
366.26	something that Bertie County didn't otherwise have,
369.26	and to be sort of the -- to usher that in
371.26	as a new type of tool in their tool kit.
374.26	The initial goal became using design
376.26	within the public education system in partnership with Dr. Zullinger --
379.26	that was why we were there.
381.26	But beyond that, we recognized
383.26	that Bertie County, as a community,
385.26	was in dire need of a fresh perspective
388.26	of pride and connectedness
390.26	and of the creative capital
392.26	that they were so much lacking.
394.26	So the goal became, yes, to apply design within education,
397.26	but then to figure out how to make education
399.26	a great vehicle for community development.
402.26	So in order to do this, we've taken three different approaches
404.26	to the intersection of design and education.
407.26	And I should say that these are three things that we've done in Bertie County,
410.26	but I feel pretty confident that they could work
412.26	in a lot of other rural communities
414.26	around the U.S. and maybe even beyond.
417.26	So the first of the three is design for education.
420.26	This is the most kind of direct, obvious
423.26	intersection of the two things.
425.26	It's the physical construction
427.26	of improved spaces and materials and experiences
430.26	for teachers and students.
432.26	This is in response to the awful mobile trailers
435.26	and the outdated textbooks
437.26	and the terrible materials that we're building schools out of these days.
441.26	And so this played out for us in a couple different ways.
443.26	The first was a series of renovations of computer labs.
446.26	So traditionally, the computer labs,
448.26	particularly in an under-performing school like Bertie County,
451.26	where they have to benchmark test every other week,
454.26	the computer lab is a kill-and-drill
456.26	testing facility.
458.26	You come in, you face the wall, you take your test and you leave.
461.26	So we wanted to change the way that students approach technology,
464.26	to create a more convivial and social space
467.26	that was more engaging, more accessible,
469.26	and also to increase the ability for teachers
471.26	to use these spaces for technology-based instruction.
474.26	So this is the lab at the high school,
476.26	and the principal there is in love with this room.
478.26	Every time he has visitors, it's the first place that he takes them.
482.26	And this also meant the co-creation with some teachers
484.26	of this educational playground system
486.26	called the learning landscape.
488.26	It allows elementary-level students to learn core subjects
491.26	through game play and activity
493.26	and running around and screaming and being a kid.
495.26	So this game that the kids are playing here --
497.26	in this case they were learning basic multiplication
499.26	through a game called Match Me.
501.26	And in Match Me, you take the class, divide it into two teams,
504.26	one team on each side of the playground,
506.26	and the teacher will take a piece of chalk
508.26	and just write a number on each of the tires.
510.26	And then she'll call out a math problem --
512.26	so let's say four times four --
514.26	and then one student from each team has to compete
517.26	to figure out that four times four is 16
519.26	and find the tire with the 16 on it and sit on it.
522.26	So the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires
524.26	and then your team wins.
526.26	And the impact of the learning landscape
528.26	has been pretty surprising and amazing.
530.26	Some of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores,
533.26	a greater comfort level with the material,
535.26	especially with the boys,
537.26	that in going outside and playing,
539.26	they aren't afraid to take on
541.26	a double-digit multiplication problem --
543.26	and also that the teachers are able
545.26	to use these as assessment tools
547.26	to better gauge how their students
549.26	are understanding new material.
551.26	So with design for education, I think the most important thing
554.26	is to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers,
557.26	so that they have the incentive and the desire to use them.
560.26	So this is Mr. Perry. He's the assistant superintendent.
563.26	He came out for one of our teacher-training days
566.26	and won like five rounds of Match Me in a row and was very proud of himself.
569.26	(Laughter)
572.26	So the second approach is redesigning education itself.
575.26	This is the most complex.
577.26	It's a systems-level look
579.26	at how education is administered
581.26	and what is being offered and to whom.
583.26	So in many cases this is not so much about making change
586.26	as it is creating the conditions
588.26	under which change is possible
590.26	and the incentive to want to make change,
592.26	which is easier said than done in rural communities
595.26	and in inside-the-box education systems
597.26	in rural communities.
600.26	So for us, this was a graphic public campaign
602.26	called Connect Bertie.
604.26	There are thousands of these blue dots all over the county.
607.26	And this was for a fund that the school district had
609.26	to put a desktop computer and a broadband Internet connection
612.26	in every home
614.26	with a child in the public school system.
616.26	Right now I should say,
618.26	there are only 10 percent of the houses
620.26	that actually have an in-home Internet connection.
622.26	And the only places to get WiFi
624.26	are in the school buildings, or at the Bojangles Fried Chicken joint,
627.26	which I find myself squatting outside of a lot.
630.26	Aside from, you know, getting people excited
632.26	and wondering what the heck these blue dots were all over the place,
636.26	it asked the school system
638.26	to envision how it might become a catalyst
640.26	for a more connected community.
642.26	It asked them to reach outside of the school walls
645.26	and to think about how they could play a role
647.26	in the community's development.
649.26	So the first batch of computers
651.26	are being installed later this summer,
653.26	and we're helping Dr. Zullinger develop some strategies
656.26	around how we might connect the classroom and the home
659.26	to extend learning beyond the school day.
661.26	And then the third approach, which is what I'm most excited about,
663.26	which is where we are now,
665.26	is: design as education.
667.26	"So ""design as education"" means"
669.26	that we could actually teach design within public schools,
672.26	and not design-based learning --
674.26	"not like ""let's learn physics by building a rocket,"""
677.26	but actually learning design-thinking
680.26	coupled with real construction and fabrication skills
683.26	put towards a local community purpose.
686.26	It also means that designers are no longer consultants,
688.26	but we're teachers,
690.26	and we are charged with growing creative capital
692.26	within the next generation.
694.26	And what design offers as an educational framework
697.26	is an antidote
699.26	to all of the boring, rigid, verbal instruction
701.26	that so many of these school districts are plagued by.
703.26	It's hands-on, it's in-your-face,
705.26	it requires an active engagement,
707.26	and it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning
710.26	in real ways.
712.26	So we started thinking
714.26	about the legacy of shop class
716.26	and how shop class -- wood and metal shop class in particular --
719.26	historically, has been something
721.26	intended for kids who aren't going to go to college.
723.26	It's a vocational training path.
725.26	It's working-class; it's blue-collar.
727.26	The projects are things like,
729.26	let's make a birdhouse for your mom for Christmas.
732.26	And in recent decades, a lot of the funding for shop class
734.26	has gone away entirely.
736.26	So we thought, what if you could bring back shop class,
739.26	but this time orient the projects
741.26	around things that the community needed,
744.26	and to infuse shop class
746.26	with a more critical and creative-design-thinking studio process.
749.26	So we took this kind of nebulous idea
751.26	and have worked really closely with Dr. Zullinger for the past year
754.26	on writing this as a one-year curriculum
757.26	offered at the high school level to the junior class.
759.26	And so this starts in four weeks,
761.26	at the end of the summer,
763.26	and my partner and I, Matthew and I,
765.26	just went through the arduous and totally convoluted process
768.26	of getting certified as high school teachers to actually run it.
770.26	And this is what it looks like.
772.26	So over the course of two semesters,
774.26	the Fall and the Spring,
776.26	the students spend three hours a day every single day
778.26	in our 4,500 square foot
780.26	studio/shop space.
783.26	And during that time, they're doing everything
786.26	from going out and doing ethnographic research and doing the need-finding,
788.26	coming back into the studio,
790.26	doing the brainstorming and design visualization
792.26	to come up with concepts that might work,
794.26	and then moving into the shop and actually testing them,
796.26	building them, prototyping them,
798.26	figuring out if they are going to work and refining that.
801.26	And then over the summer, they're offered a summer job.
804.26	They're paid as employees of Project H
806.26	to be the construction crew with us
808.26	to build these projects in the community.
810.26	So the first project, which will be built next summer,
813.26	is an open-air farmers' market downtown,
817.26	followed by bus shelters for the school bus system in the second year
820.26	and home improvements for the elderly in the third year.
823.26	So these are real visible projects
825.26	that hopefully the students can point to and say,
827.26	"""I built that, and I'm proud of it."""
829.26	So I want you to meet three of our students.
831.26	This is Ryan.
833.26	She is 15 years old.
835.26	She loves agriculture and wants to be a high school teacher.
838.26	She wants to go to college, but she wants to come back to Bertie County,
840.26	because that's where her family is from, where she calls home,
843.26	and she feels very strongly about giving back
845.26	to this place that she's been fairly fortunate in.
848.26	So what Studio H might offer her
850.26	is a way to develop skills
852.26	so that she might give back in the most meaningful way.
854.26	This is Eric. He plays for the football team.
857.26	He is really into dirtbike racing,
860.26	and he wants to be an architect.
862.26	So for him, Studio H offers him
864.26	a way to develop the skills he will need as an architect,
867.26	everything from drafting to wood and metal construction
870.26	to how to do research for a client.
872.26	And then this is Anthony.
874.26	He is 16 years old, loves hunting and fishing and being outside
877.26	and doing anything with his hands,
879.26	and so for him, Studio H means
881.26	that he can stay interested in his education
883.26	through that hands-on engagement.
885.26	He's interested in forestry, but he isn't sure,
887.26	so if he ends up not going to college,
889.26	he will have developed some industry-relevant skills.
892.26	What design and building really offers to public education
894.26	is a different kind of classroom.
896.26	So this building downtown,
898.26	which may very well become the site of our future farmers' market,
901.26	is now the classroom.
903.26	And going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors
905.26	about what kind of food they buy
907.26	and from where and why --
909.26	that's a homework assignment.
911.26	And the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the end of the summer
914.26	when they have built the farmers' market and it's open to the public --
916.26	that's the final exam.
918.26	And for the community, what design and building offers
921.26	is real, visible, built progress.
923.26	It's one project per year,
925.26	and it makes the youth the biggest asset
927.26	and the biggest untapped resource
929.26	in imagining a new future.
932.26	So we recognize that Studio H, especially in its first year,
935.26	is a small story --
940.26	it's one project in one place.
942.26	But we feel like this could work in other places.
944.26	And I really, strongly believe in the power of the small story,
947.26	because it is so difficult
949.26	to do humanitarian work at a global scale.
952.26	Because, when you zoom out that far,
954.26	you lose the ability to view people as humans.
958.26	Ultimately, design itself is a process
960.26	of constant education
962.26	for the people that we work with and for
964.26	and for us as designers.
966.26	And let's face it, designers, we need to reinvent ourselves.
969.26	We need to re-educate ourselves around the things that matter,
972.26	we need to work outside of our comfort zones more,
975.26	and we need to be better citizens in our own backyard.
978.26	So while this is a very small story,
980.26	we hope that it represents a step in the right direction
983.26	for the future of rural communities
985.26	and for the future of public education
987.26	and hopefully also for the future of design.
989.26	Thank you.
991.26	(Applause)
