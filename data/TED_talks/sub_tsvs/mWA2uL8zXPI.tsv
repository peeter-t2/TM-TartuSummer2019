12.78	For several years now,
14.22	we've been engaged in a national debate
14.22	about sexual assault on campus.
18.98	No question --
20.22	it's crucial that young people
20.22	understand the ground rules for consent,
25.18	but that's where the conversation
25.18	about sex is ending.
28.86	And in that vacuum of information
30.94	the media and the Internet --
32.94	that new digital street corner --
34.7	are educating our kids for us.
38.02	If we truly want young people
38.02	to engage safely, ethically,
43.18	and yes, enjoyably,
45.9	it's time to have open honest discussion
45.9	"about what happens after ""yes,"""
52.5	and that includes breaking
52.5	the biggest taboo of all
55.7	and talking to young people
57.46	about women's capacity for
57.46	and entitlement to sexual pleasure.
63.26	Yeah.
64.5	(Applause)
65.54	Come on, ladies.
66.78	(Applause)
68.7	I spent three years
68.7	talking to girls ages 15 to 20
72.54	about their attitudes
72.54	and experience of sex.
75.5	And what I found was
76.94	that while young women may feel
76.94	entitled to engage in sexual behavior,
81.26	they don't necessarily
81.26	feel entitled to enjoy it.
85.06	Take this sophomore
85.06	at the Ivy League college
87.22	who told me,
88.46	"""I come from a long line"
88.46	of smart, strong women.
91.74	My grandmother was a firecracker,
93.98	my mom is a professional,
95.86	my sister and I are loud,
95.86	"and that's our form of feminine power."""
100.18	She then proceeded
100.18	to describe her sex life to me:
102.9	a series of one-off hookups,
104.98	starting when she was 13,
106.74	that were ...
108.22	not especially responsible,
110.34	not especially reciprocal
112.5	and not especially enjoyable.
114.9	She shrugged.
116.54	"""I guess we girls are just socialized"
116.54	to be these docile creatures
120.18	"who don't express our wants or needs."""
123.38	"""Wait a minute,"" I replied."
124.98	"""Didn't you just tell me"
124.98	"what a smart, strong woman you are?"""
128.82	She hemmed and hawed.
130.86	"""I guess,"" she finally said,"
132.74	"""no one told me that that smart,"
132.74	"strong image applies to sex."""
137.74	I should probably say right up top
137.74	that despite the hype,
140.739	teenagers are not engaging in intercourse
140.739	more often or at a younger age
145.66	than they were 25 years ago.
147.9	They are, however,
147.9	engaging in other behavior.
151.58	And when we ignore that,
153.18	"when we label that as ""not sex,"""
156.42	that opens the door
156.42	to risky behavior and disrespect.
160.86	That's particularly true of oral sex,
163.42	which teenagers consider
163.42	to be less intimate than intercourse.
167.34	"Girls would tell me, ""it's no big deal,"""
170.26	like they'd all read
170.26	the same instruction manual --
173.34	at least if boys
173.34	were on the receiving end.
177.42	Young women have lots
177.42	of reasons for participating.
180.3	It made them feel desired;
182.02	it was a way to boost social status.
184.62	Sometimes, it was a way
184.62	to get out of an uncomfortable situation.
188.38	As a freshman at a West Coast
188.38	college said to me,
191.46	"""A girl will give a guy a blow job"
191.46	at the end of the night
194.22	because she doesn't
194.22	want to have sex with him,
196.42	and he expects to be satisfied.
198.54	So, if I want him to leave
200.42	"and I don't want anything to happen ... """
204.54	I heard so many stories
204.54	of girls performing one-sided oral sex
208.7	that I started asking,
210.74	"""What if every time"
210.74	you were alone with a guy,
213.02	he told you to get him
213.02	a glass of water from the kitchen,
216.02	and he never got you a glass of water --
219.38	or if he did, it was like ...
223.7	"'you want me to uh ...?'"""
225.74	You know, totally begrudging.
227.82	You wouldn't stand for it.
230.78	But it wasn't always
230.78	that boys didn't want to.
233.42	It was that girls didn't want them to.
236.1	Girls expressed a sense of shame
236.1	around their genitals.
239.3	A sense that they were
239.3	simultaneously icky and sacred.
244.14	Women's feelings about their genitals
245.98	have been directly linked
245.98	to their enjoyment of sex.
249.98	Yet, Debby Herbenick,
249.98	a researcher at Indiana University,
253.54	believes that girls' genital
253.54	self-image is under siege,
258.14	with more pressure than ever
259.82	to see them as unacceptable
259.82	in their natural state.
264.38	According to research,
265.62	about three-quarters of college women
265.62	remove their pubic hair -- all of it --
270.06	at least on occasion,
271.74	and more than half do so regularly.
275.02	Girls would tell me that hair removal
275.02	made them feel cleaner,
279.18	that it was a personal choice.
282.66	Though, I kind of wondered
282.66	if left alone on a desert island,
286.9	if this was how they would
286.9	choose to spend their time.
289.94	(Laughter)
291.5	And when I pushed further,
292.94	a darker motivation emerged:
295.1	avoiding humiliation.
297.7	"""Guys act like they"
297.7	"would be disgusted by it,"""
300.62	one young woman told me.
302.7	"""No one wants to be"
302.7	"talked about like that."""
306.06	The rising pubic hair removal
306.06	reminded me of the 1920s,
309.5	when women first started regularly
309.5	shaving their armpits and their legs.
314.02	That's when flapper dresses
314.02	came into style,
316.58	and women's limbs were suddenly visible,
319.18	open to public scrutiny.
321.46	There's a way that I think
321.46	that this too is a sign.
324.46	That a girl's most intimate part
324.46	is open to public scrutiny,
329.26	open to critique,
330.98	to becoming more about
330.98	how it looks to someone else
334.5	than how it feels to her.
337.82	The shaving trend has sparked
337.82	another rise in labiaplasty.
342.26	Labiaplasty, which is the trimming
342.26	of the inner and outer labia,
346.98	is the fastest-growing cosmetic
346.98	surgery among teenage girls.
352.98	It rose 80 percent between 2014 and 2015,
357.7	and whereas girls under 18 comprise
357.7	two percent of all cosmetic surgeries,
361.74	they are five percent of labiaplasty.
365.74	The most sought-after look, incidentally,
367.74	in which the outer labia
367.74	appear fused like a clam shell,
371.5	is called ...
372.98	wait for it ...
375.06	"""The Barbie."""
376.66	(Groan)
377.98	I trust I don't have to tell you
380.02	that Barbie is a) made of plastic
382.94	and b) has no genitalia.
386.14	(Laughter)
388.06	The labiaplasty trend
388.06	has become so worrisome
390.86	that the American College
390.86	of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
394.54	has issued a statement on the procedure,
396.82	which is rarely medically indicated,
399.34	has not been proven safe
401.5	and whose side effects
401.5	include scarring, numbness, pain
407.38	and diminished sexual sensation.
410.38	Now, admittedly,
411.82	and blessedly,
413.42	the number of girls involved
413.42	is still quite small,
417.02	but you could see them
417.02	as canaries in a coal mine,
420.1	telling us something important
420.1	about the way girls see their bodies.
425.58	Sara McClelland,
427.3	a psychologist
427.3	at the University of Michigan,
429.78	coined what is my favorite phrase ever
429.78	in talking about all of this:
435.14	"""Intimate justice."""
438.5	That's the idea that sex has political,
438.5	as well as personal implications,
442.62	just like, who does
442.62	the dishes in your house,
445.3	or who vacuums the rug.
447.5	And it raises similar
447.5	issues about inequality,
451.34	about economic disparity,
453.34	violence,
454.58	physical and mental health.
456.94	Intimate justice asks us to consider
460.42	who is entitled
460.42	to engage in an experience.
463.78	Who is entitled to enjoy it?
466.3	Who is the primary beneficiary?
469.06	And how does each partner
469.06	"define ""good enough""?"
473.34	Honestly, I think those questions
473.34	are tricky and sometimes traumatic
478.26	for adult women to confront,
480.82	but when we're talking about girls,
483.14	I just kept coming back to the idea
483.14	that their early sexual experience
488.46	shouldn't have to be
488.46	something that they get over.
493.38	In her work,
494.62	McClelland found that young women
494.62	were more likely than young men
498.46	to use their partner's pleasure
498.46	as a measure of their satisfaction.
502.94	So they'd say things like,
504.3	"""If he's sexually satisfied,"
506.14	"then I'm sexually satisfied."""
508.26	Young men were more likely to measure
508.26	their satisfaction by their own orgasm.
514.66	Young women also defined
514.66	bad sex differently.
519.74	In the largest ever survey
521.26	ever conducted
521.26	on American sexual behavior,
524.42	they reported pain
524.42	in their sexual encounters
531.34	"They also used words like ""depressing,"""
534.94	"""humiliating,"""
536.54	"""degrading."""
538.26	The young men never used that language.
542.26	So when young women
542.26	report sexual satisfaction levels
545.66	that are equal to
545.66	or greater than young men's --
549.26	and they do in research --
551.26	that can be deceptive.
553.46	If a girl goes into an encounter
553.46	hoping that it won't hurt,
557.1	wanting to feel close to her partner
559.14	and expecting him to have an orgasm,
561.98	she'll be satisfied
561.98	if those criteria are met.
564.94	And there's nothing wrong with wanting
564.94	to feel close to your partner,
568.22	or wanting him to be happy,
569.58	and orgasm isn't the only
569.58	measure of an experience ...
573.38	but absence of pain --
575.58	that's a very low bar
575.58	for your own sexual fulfillment.
580.82	Listening to all of this
580.82	and thinking about it,
583.06	I began to realize that we performed
583.06	a kind of psychological clitoridectomy
588.38	on American girls.
590.18	Starting in infancy,
591.5	parents of baby boys are more likely
591.5	to name all their body parts,
595.34	at least they'll say,
595.34	"""here's your pee-pee."""
598.1	Parents of baby girls
598.1	go right from navel to knees,
601.3	and they leave this whole
601.3	situation in here unnamed.
604.78	(Laughter)
606.14	There's no better way
606.14	to make something unspeakable
609.62	than not to name it.
612.1	Then kids go into
612.1	their puberty education classes
614.54	and they learn that boys
614.54	have erections and ejaculations,
618.42	and girls have ...
620.18	periods and unwanted pregnancy.
623.86	And they see that internal diagram
623.86	of a woman's reproductive system --
627.74	you know, the one that looks
627.74	kind of like a steer head --
630.46	(Laughter)
634.54	And it always grays out between the legs.
637.58	So we never say vulva,
639.78	we certainly never say clitoris.
642.18	No surprise,
643.42	fewer than half
643.42	of teenage girls age 14 to 17
646.58	have ever masturbated.
649.18	And then they go
649.18	into their partnered experience
652.02	and we expect that somehow
652.02	they'll think sex is about them,
655.74	that they'll be able to articulate
655.74	their needs, their desires, their limits.
661.3	It's unrealistic.
664.26	Here's something, though.
666.14	Girls' investment
666.14	in their partner's pleasure remains
669.34	regardless of the gender of the partner.
672.5	So in same-sex encounters,
674.78	the orgasm gap disappears.
677.98	And young women climax
677.98	at the same rate as men.
681.94	Lesbian and bisexual girls would tell me
684.14	that they felt liberated
684.14	to get off the script --
687.74	free to create an encounter
687.74	that worked for them.
691.18	Gay girls also challenged
691.18	the idea of first intercourse
694.86	as the definition of virginity.
696.82	Not because intercourse isn't a big deal,
699.42	but it's worth questioning
699.42	why we consider this one act,
703.82	which most girls associate
703.82	with discomfort or pain,
706.66	to be the line in the sand
706.66	of sexual adulthood --
710.18	so much more meaningful,
711.66	so much more transformative
711.66	than anything else.
715.46	And it's worth considering
715.46	how this is serving girls;
718.94	whether it's keeping them
718.94	safer from disease,
721.98	coercion, betrayal, assault.
725.42	Whether it's encouraging
725.42	mutuality and caring;
729.18	what it means about the way
729.18	they see other sex acts;
732.82	whether it's giving them more control over
735.06	and joy in their experience,
737.5	and what it means about gay teens,
740.46	who can have multiple sex partners
740.46	without heterosexual intercourse.
745.78	So I asked a gay girl that I met,
748.34	"""How'd you know"
748.34	"you weren't a virgin anymore?"""
751.38	She said she had to Google it.
752.86	(Laughter)
755.06	And Google wasn't sure.
757.02	(Laughter)
758.86	She finally decided
758.86	that she wasn't a virgin anymore
761.82	after she'd had
761.82	her first orgasm with a partner.
765.78	And I thought --
767.38	whoa.
768.94	What if just for a second
771.62	we imagined that was the definition?
775.38	Again, not because
775.38	intercourse isn't a big deal --
777.74	of course it is --
779.06	but it isn't the only big deal,
782.18	and rather than thinking about sex
782.18	as a race to a goal,
785.98	this helps us reconceptualize it
785.98	as a pool of experiences
791.1	that include warmth, affection, arousal,
795.74	desire, touch, intimacy.
799.46	And it's worth asking young people:
801.7	who's really the more sexually
801.7	experienced person?
805.26	The one who makes out
805.26	with a partner for three hours
808.34	and experiments with sensual
808.34	tension and communication,
812.94	or the one who gets wasted at a party
812.94	and hooks up with a random
816.78	"in order to dump their ""virginity"""
816.78	before they get to college?
821.46	The only way that shift
821.46	in thinking can happen though
824.66	is if we talk to young people
824.66	more about sex --
828.74	if we normalize those discussions,
831.1	integrating them into everyday life,
834.02	talking about those intimate acts
834.02	in a different way --
837.58	the way we mostly have changed
840.38	in the way that we talk
840.38	about women in the public realm.
843.54	Consider a survey
843.54	of 300 randomly chosen girls
848.14	from a Dutch and an American university,
850.54	two similar universities,
852.3	talking about their early
852.3	experience of sex.
856.1	The Dutch girls embodied everything
856.1	we say we want from our girls.
861.06	They had fewer negative consequences,
863.02	like disease, pregnancy, regret --
866.46	more positive outcomes
868.26	like being able to communicate
868.26	with their partner,
870.7	who they said they knew very well;
872.42	preparing for the experience responsibly;
875.02	enjoying themselves.
877.5	What was their secret?
879.54	The Dutch girls said
879.54	that their doctors, teachers and parents
883.82	talked to them candidly,
885.46	from an early age,
887.22	about sex, pleasure
887.22	and the importance of mutual trust.
893.3	What's more,
894.54	while American parents weren't necessarily
894.54	less comfortable talking about sex,
899.34	we tend to frame those conversations
901.86	entirely in terms or risk and danger,
906.42	whereas Dutch parents talk
906.42	about balancing responsibility and joy.
912.02	I have to tell you,
913.26	as a parent myself,
915.14	that hit me hard,
917.22	because I know,
919.78	had I not delved into that research,
922.06	I would have talked to my own child
922.06	about contraception,
925.86	about disease protection,
927.74	about consent because I'm a modern parent,
930.5	and I would have thought ...
933.82	job well done.
936.14	Now I know that's not enough.
939.74	I also know what I hope for for our girls.
943.78	I want them to see sexuality
943.78	as a source of self-knowledge,
948.06	creativity and communication,
950.3	despite its potential risks.
952.94	I want them to be able
952.94	to revel in their bodies' sensuality
956.42	without being reduced to it.
958.94	I want them to be able
958.94	to ask for what they want in bed,
962.18	and to get it.
964.38	I want them to be safe
964.38	from unwanted pregnancy,
967.86	disease,
969.1	cruelty,
970.34	dehumanization,
971.94	violence.
973.9	If they are assaulted,
975.7	I want them to have recourse
975.7	from their schools,
979.18	their employers,
980.62	the courts.
982.94	It's a lot to ask,
985.06	but it's not too much.
987.3	As parents, teachers,
987.3	advocates and activists,
991.38	we have raised a generation
991.38	of girls to have a voice,
996.18	to expect egalitarian
996.18	treatment in the home,
1000.06	in the classroom,
1001.34	in the workplace.
1003.54	Now it's time to demand
1003.54	that intimate justice
1008.22	in their personal lives as well.
1011.58	Thank you.
1012.82	(Applause)
