12.82	An article in the Yale Alumni Magazine
17.06	told the story of Clyde Murphy,
19.66	a black man who was a member
19.66	of the Class of 1970.
24.78	Clyde was a success story.
28.14	After Yale and a law degree from Columbia,
31.98	Clyde spent the next 30 years
34.22	as one of America's
34.22	top civil rights lawyers.
38.1	He was also a great husband and father.
41.9	But despite his success,
44.66	personally and professionally,
47.9	Clyde's story had a sad ending.
51.26	In 2010,
53.54	at the age of 62,
56.46	Clyde died from a blood clot in his lung.
61.94	Clyde's experience was not unique.
66.54	Many of his black classmates from Yale
69.42	also died young.
71.9	In fact, the magazine article indicated
76.139	that 41 years after graduation from Yale,
79.86	the black members of the Class of 1970
83.06	had a death rate
83.06	that was three times higher
86.34	than that of the average class member.
90.5	It's stunning.
93.06	America has recently awakened
96.5	to a steady drumbeat
98.7	of unarmed black men
98.7	being shot by the police.
103.78	What is even a bigger story
108.38	is that every seven minutes,
111.5	a black person dies prematurely
111.5	in the United States.
116.26	That is over 200 black people
120.1	die every single day
122.26	who would not die if the health
122.26	of blacks and whites were equal.
130.06	For the last 25 years,
132.74	I have been on a mission
134.7	to understand why does race
137.5	matter so profoundly for health.
141.579	When I started my career,
143.38	many believed that it was simply
143.38	about racial differences
147.78	in income and education.
150.3	I discovered that while
150.3	economic status matters for health,
156.02	there is more to the story.
157.94	So for example, if we look
157.94	at life expectancy at age 25,
163.78	at age 25 there's a five-year gap
163.78	between blacks and whites.
168.9	And the gap by education
168.9	for both whites and blacks
172.86	is even larger than the racial gap.
176.78	At the same time,
176.78	at every level of education,
181.42	whites live longer than blacks.
184.38	So whites who are high school dropouts
186.7	live 3.4 years longer
186.7	than their black counterparts,
190.42	and the gap is even larger
193.34	among college graduates.
196.02	Most surprising of all,
199.06	whites who have graduated from high school
202.46	live longer than blacks
202.46	with a college degree
206.18	or more education.
208.42	So why does race matter
208.42	so profoundly for health?
212.34	What else is it
212.34	beyond education and income
217.22	that might matter?
219.86	In the early 1990s,
222.34	I was asked to review a new book
225.42	on the health of black America.
228.02	I was struck that almost every single one
231.14	of its 25 chapters
233.42	said that racism
235.22	was a factor that was hurting
235.22	the health of blacks.
239.18	All of these researchers
241.94	were stating that racism was a factor
241.94	adversely impacting blacks,
247.9	but they provided no evidence.
250.38	For me, that was not good enough.
253.78	A few months later,
255.46	I was speaking at a conference
255.46	in Washington, DC,
258.42	and I said that one
258.42	of the priorities for research
261.62	was to document the ways
261.62	in which racism affected health.
266.7	A white gentleman stood in the audience
269.26	and said that while he agreed
269.26	with me that racism was important,
274.06	we could never measure racism.
276.7	"""We measure self-esteem,"" I said."
280.02	"""There's no reason"
281.46	why we can't measure racism
281.46	"if we put our minds to it."""
285.54	And so I put my mind to it
288.06	and developed three scales.
290.26	The first one captured
290.26	major experiences of discrimination,
294.26	like being unfairly fired
294.26	or being unfairly stopped by the police.
298.54	But discrimination also occurs
298.54	in more minor and subtle experiences,
303.86	and so my second scale,
303.86	called the Everyday Discrimination Scale,
307.82	captures nine items
309.58	that captures experiences
310.94	like you're treated
310.94	with less courtesy than others,
314.26	you receive poorer service
314.26	than others in restaurants or stores,
317.86	or people act as if they're afraid of you.
321.06	This scale captures
323.9	ways in which the dignity and the respect
327.5	of people who society does not value
330.46	is chipped away on a daily basis.
333.78	Research has found
337.26	that higher levels of discrimination
340.14	are associated with an elevated risk
340.14	of a broad range of diseases
345.7	from blood pressure to abdominal obesity
348.98	to breast cancer to heart disease
351.66	and even premature mortality.
355.34	Strikingly, some of the effects
355.34	are observed at a very young age.
360.46	For example, a study of black teens
365.94	found that those who reported higher
365.94	levels of discrimination as teenagers
372.94	had higher levels of stress hormones,
377.34	of blood pressure
379.3	and of weight at age 20.
384.26	However,
387.74	the stress of discrimination
390.3	is only one aspect.
392.26	Discrimination and racism
394.78	also matters in other
394.78	profound ways for health.
399.1	For example, there's
399.1	discrimination in medical care.
402.9	In 1999, the National Academy of Medicine
407.22	asked me to serve on a committee
409.18	that found, concluded
409.18	based on the scientific evidence,
414.26	that blacks and other minorities
416.78	receive poorer quality care than whites.
420.3	This was true for all kinds
420.3	of medical treatment,
424.18	from the most simple
426.54	to the most technologically sophisticated.
430.62	One explanation for this pattern
433.66	was a phenomenon
433.66	"that's called ""implicit bias"""
437.62	"or ""unconscious discrimination."""
439.94	Research for decades
439.94	by social psychologists
442.78	indicates that if you hold
442.78	a negative stereotype
446.3	about a group in your subconscious mind
449.38	and you meet someone from that group,
452.1	you will discriminate against that person.
454.42	You will treat them differently.
456.1	It's an unconscious process.
456.1	It's an automatic process.
460.74	It is a subtle process, but it's normal
463.94	and it occurs even among
463.94	the most well-intentioned individuals.
471.1	But the deeper that I delved
474.14	into the health impact of racism,
477.18	the more insidious the effects became.
480.98	There is institutional discrimination,
484.42	which refers to discrimination
487.26	that exists in the processes
487.26	of social institutions.
492.22	Residential segregation by race,
494.58	which has led to blacks and whites living
494.58	in very different neighborhood contexts,
499.58	is a classic example
499.58	of institutional racism.
504.94	One of America's best-kept secrets
508.9	is how residential segregation
511.1	is the secret source
513.46	that creates racial inequality
513.46	in the United States.
518.62	In America, where you live
521.58	determines your access to opportunities
524.739	in education, in employment,
528.06	in housing and even
528.06	in access to medical care.
533.46	One study of the 171 largest
533.46	cities in the United States
539.9	concluded that there is not even one city
543.22	where whites live
543.22	under equal conditions to blacks,
546.58	and that the worst urban contexts
546.58	in which whites reside
550.54	is considerably better than the average
550.54	context of black communities.
555.74	Another study found
557.46	that if you could eliminate statistically
560.5	residential segregation,
562.18	you would completely erase
562.18	black-white differences in income,
566.34	education and unemployment,
568.86	and reduce black-white differences
568.86	in single motherhood
572.18	by two thirds,
573.42	all of that driven by segregation.
576.78	I have also learned
578.86	how the negative stereotypes
581.66	and images of blacks in our culture
584.66	literally create and sustain
587.7	both institutional
587.7	and individual discrimination.
592.46	A group of researchers
592.46	have put together a database
596.3	that contains the books,
598.54	magazines and articles
601.58	that an average college-educated
601.58	American would read over their lifetime.
606.3	It allows us to look within this database
609.14	and see how Americans
609.14	have seen words paired together
614.5	as they grow up in their society.
617.02	"So when the word ""black"""
617.02	appears in American culture,
621.02	what co-occurs with it?
623.1	"""Poor,"""
624.54	"""violent,"""
625.78	"""religious,"""
627.14	"""lazy,"""
628.38	"""cheerful,"""
629.62	"""dangerous."""
631.38	"When ""white"" occurs,"
632.9	the frequently co-occurring words
635.18	"are ""wealthy,"""
636.54	"""progressive,"""
637.82	"""conventional,"""
639.94	"""stubborn,"""
641.18	"""successful,"""
642.42	"""educated."""
644.1	So when a police officer
647.42	overreacts when he sees
647.42	an unarmed black male
653.06	and perceives him
653.06	to be violent and dangerous,
657.78	we are not necessarily dealing
657.78	with an inherently bad cop.
663.1	We may be simply viewing
665.66	a normal American
667.7	who is reflecting
667.7	what he has been exposed to
671.5	as a result of being raised
673.94	in this society.
675.9	From my own experience,
679.66	I believe that your race
682.3	does not have to be
682.3	a determinant of your destiny.
686.54	I migrated to the United States
689.1	from the Caribbean island of Saint Lucia
692.26	in the late 1970s
694.66	in pursuit of higher education,
697.82	and in the last 40 years,
700.22	I have done well.
702.1	I have had a supportive family,
704.74	I have worked hard,
707.06	I have done well.
708.94	But it took more for me to be successful.
712.42	I received a minority fellowship
712.42	from the University of Michigan.
717.26	Yes. I am an affirmative action baby.
722.38	Without affirmative action,
725.18	I would not be here.
728.82	But in the last 40 years,
731.38	black America has been
731.38	less successful than I have.
736.54	In 1978, black households
736.54	in the United States
741.86	earned 59 cents for every dollar
741.86	of income whites earned.
746.86	In 2015,
749.14	black families still earn 59 cents
754.02	for every dollar of income
754.02	that white families receive,
757.86	and the racial gaps in wealth
757.86	are even more stunning.
762.42	For every dollar of wealth
762.42	that whites have,
765.7	black families have six pennies
765.7	and Latinos have seven pennies.
770.62	The fact is,
772.1	racism
774.06	is producing a truly rigged system
778.42	that is systematically disadvantaging
778.42	some racial groups in the United States.
784.7	To paraphrase Plato,
786.9	there is nothing so unfair
790.7	as the equal treatment of unequal people.
795.34	And that's why I am committed
798.26	to working to dismantle racism.
801.78	I deeply appreciate the fact
804.26	that I am standing on the shoulders
807.54	of those who have sacrificed
807.54	even their lives to open the doors
811.9	that I have walked through.
814.1	I want to ensure
814.1	that those doors remain open
818.02	and that everyone
818.02	can walk through those doors.
824.14	Robert Kennedy said,
826.5	"""Each time a man"" --"
826.5	or woman, I would add --
830.06	"""stands up for an ideal"
832.18	or acts to improve the lot of others
834.78	or strikes out against injustice,
837.38	he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope,
840.94	and those ripples can build a current
844.06	that can sweep down the mightiest walls
844.06	"of oppression and resistance."""
849.86	I am optimistic today
851.94	because all across America,
854.54	I have seen ripples of hope.
857.54	The Boston Medical Center
859.46	has added lawyers to the medical team
862.98	so that physicians can improve
862.98	the health of their patients
867.06	because the lawyers are addressing
867.06	the nonmedical needs their patients have.
872.3	Loma Linda University
872.3	has built a gateway college
876.14	in nearby San Bernardino
877.98	so that in addition
877.98	to delivering medical care,
881.3	they can provide job skills
884.14	and job training
885.82	to a predominantly minority,
885.82	low-income community members
890.62	so that they will have the skills
890.62	they need to get a decent job.
896.78	In Chapel Hill, North Carolina,
899.18	the Abecedarian Project has figured out
902.9	how to ensure that they have lowered
902.9	the risks for heart disease
908.22	for blacks in their mid-30s
911.3	by providing high-quality day care
914.34	from birth to age five.
917.06	In after-school centers
917.06	across the United States,
920.38	Wintley Phipps and the US Dream Academy
923.06	is breaking the cycle of incarceration
925.86	by providing high-quality
925.86	academic enrichment and mentoring
930.3	to the children of prisoners
933.02	and children who have
933.02	fallen behind in school.
936.42	In Huntsville, Alabama,
938.14	Oakwood University,
939.58	a historically black institution,
941.94	is showing how we can improve
941.94	the health of black adults
946.26	by including a health evaluation
949.3	as a part of freshman orientation
952.46	and giving those students
952.46	the tools they need
955.46	to make healthy choices
957.14	and providing them annually
957.14	a health transcript
960.54	so they can monitor their progress.
963.34	And in Atlanta, Georgia,
965.1	Purpose Built Communities has dismantled
965.1	the negative effects of segregation
971.06	by transforming a crime-ridden,
973.74	drug-infested public housing project
976.7	into an oasis of mixed-income housing,
980.42	of academic performance,
982.62	of great community wellness
985.5	and of full employment.
987.98	And finally,
989.7	there is the Devine solution.
992.5	Professor Patricia Devine
996.22	of the University of Wisconsin
998.82	has shown us how we can attack
1002.54	our hidden biases head on
1005.54	and effectively reduce them.
1008.5	Each one of us
1010.3	can be a ripple of hope.
1013.02	This work will not always be easy,
1016.54	but former Supreme Court Justice
1016.54	Thurgood Marshall
1020.5	"has told us, ""We must dissent."
1023.42	We must dissent from the indifference.
1025.86	We must dissent from the apathy.
1027.94	We must dissent from the hatred
1027.94	and from the mistrust.
1031.42	We must dissent
1033.1	because America can do better,
1036.38	because America has no choice
1036.38	"but to do better."""
1041.22	Thank you.
1042.46	(Applause)
