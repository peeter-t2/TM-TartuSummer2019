12.76	I want to talk to you
12.76	about the future of medicine.
16.96	But before I do that, I want to talk
16.96	a little bit about the past.
21.08	Now, throughout much
21.08	of the recent history of medicine,
24.72	we've thought about illness and treatment
28.56	in terms of a profoundly simple model.
31.96	In fact, the model is so simple
34.68	that you could summarize it in six words:
37.76	have disease, take pill, kill something.
43.08	Now, the reason
43.08	for the dominance of this model
47.84	is of course the antibiotic revolution.
50.48	Many of you might not know this,
50.48	but we happen to be celebrating
53.68	the hundredth year of the introduction
53.68	of antibiotics into the United States.
57.76	But what you do know
59.4	is that that introduction
59.4	was nothing short of transformative.
64.88	Here you had a chemical,
64.88	either from the natural world
68.76	or artificially synthesized
68.76	in the laboratory,
71.52	and it would course through your body,
74.8	it would find its target,
77.6	lock into its target --
79.28	a microbe or some part of a microbe --
81.52	and then turn off a lock and a key
85.96	with exquisite deftness,
85.96	exquisite specificity.
89.52	And you would end up taking
89.52	a previously fatal, lethal disease --
93.84	a pneumonia, syphilis, tuberculosis --
97	and transforming that
97	into a curable, or treatable illness.
102.08	You have a pneumonia,
104.48	you take penicillin,
105.88	you kill the microbe
107.44	and you cure the disease.
109.6	So seductive was this idea,
112.56	so potent the metaphor of lock and key
116.76	and killing something,
118.32	that it really swept through biology.
120.36	It was a transformation like no other.
124.16	And we've really spent the last 100 years
127.36	trying to replicate that model
127.36	over and over again
130.84	in noninfectious diseases,
132.103	in chronic diseases like diabetes
132.103	and hypertension and heart disease.
137.12	And it's worked,
137.12	but it's only worked partly.
141.12	Let me show you.
142.8	You know, if you take the entire universe
145.72	of all chemical reactions
145.72	in the human body,
149.24	every chemical reaction
149.24	that your body is capable of,
152.56	most people think that that number
152.56	is on the order of a million.
155.6	Let's call it a million.
156.92	And now you ask the question,
158.64	what number or fraction of reactions
161.32	can actually be targeted
163.16	by the entire pharmacopoeia,
163.16	all of medicinal chemistry?
168	That number is 250.
171.68	The rest is chemical darkness.
174.24	In other words, 0.025 percent
174.24	of all chemical reactions in your body
180.44	are actually targetable
180.44	by this lock and key mechanism.
185.68	You know, if you think
185.68	about human physiology
188.76	as a vast global telephone network
192.24	with interacting nodes
192.24	and interacting pieces,
196.6	then all of our medicinal chemistry
199.8	is operating on one tiny corner
202.08	at the edge, the outer edge,
202.08	of that network.
204.8	It's like all of our
204.8	pharmaceutical chemistry
208.64	is a pole operator in Wichita, Kansas
212.44	who is tinkering with about
216.88	So what do we do about this idea?
220.16	What if we reorganized this approach?
224.08	In fact, it turns out
224.08	that the natural world
227.48	gives us a sense of how one
227.48	might think about illness
232.56	in a radically different way,
234.24	rather than disease, medicine, target.
239.08	In fact, the natural world
239.08	is organized hierarchically upwards,
242.48	not downwards, but upwards,
244.36	and we begin with a self-regulating,
244.36	semi-autonomous unit called a cell.
251.64	These self-regulating,
251.64	semi-autonomous units
254.88	give rise to self-regulating,
254.88	semi-autonomous units called organs,
259.72	and these organs coalesce
259.72	to form things called humans,
263.92	and these organisms
263.92	ultimately live in environments,
267.84	which are partly self-regulating
267.84	and partly semi-autonomous.
272.92	What's nice about this scheme,
272.92	this hierarchical scheme
275.76	building upwards rather than downwards,
278.48	is that it allows us
278.48	to think about illness as well
281.88	in a somewhat different way.
284.4	Take a disease like cancer.
288.12	Since the 1950s,
289.44	we've tried rather desperately to apply
289.44	this lock and key model to cancer.
294.991	We've tried to kill cells
297.905	using a variety of chemotherapies 
297.905	or targeted therapies,
302.276	and as most of us know, that's worked.
304.72	It's worked for diseases like leukemia.
306.602	It's worked for some forms
306.602	of breast cancer,
309	but eventually you run
309	to the ceiling of that approach.
312.76	And it's only in the last 10 years or so
315.28	that we've begun to think
315.28	about using the immune system,
318.44	remembering that in fact the cancer cell
318.44	doesn't grow in a vacuum.
321.56	It actually grows in a human organism.
323.64	And could you use the organismal capacity,
325.96	the fact that human beings
325.96	have an immune system, to attack cancer?
329.127	In fact, it's led to the some of the most
329.127	spectacular new medicines in cancer.
334.48	And finally there's the level
334.48	of the environment, isn't there?
338.16	You know, we don't think of cancer
338.16	as altering the environment.
341.16	But let me give you an example
341.16	of a profoundly carcinogenic environment.
346.08	It's called a prison.
348.16	You take loneliness, you take depression,
348.16	you take confinement,
353.32	and you add to that,
355.4	rolled up in a little
355.4	white sheet of paper,
359	one of the most potent neurostimulants
359	that we know, called nicotine,
362.8	and you add to that one of the most potent
362.8	addictive substances that you know,
367.76	and you have
367.76	a pro-carcinogenic environment.
371.52	But you can have anti-carcinogenic
371.52	environments too.
374	There are attempts to create milieus,
376.72	change the hormonal milieu
376.72	for breast cancer, for instance.
380.44	We're trying to change the metabolic
380.44	milieu for other forms of cancer.
383.88	Or take another disease, like depression.
386.32	Again, working upwards,
389	since the 1960s and 1970s,
389	we've tried, again, desperately
393.04	to turn off molecules
393.04	that operate between nerve cells --
397.24	serotonin, dopamine --
399.44	and tried to cure depression that way,
401.28	and that's worked,
401.28	but then that reached the limit.
405	And we now know that what you
405	really probably need to do
407.644	is to change the physiology
407.644	of the organ, the brain,
410.64	rewire it, remodel it,
412.8	and that, of course,
412.8	we know study upon study has shown
415.4	that talk therapy does exactly that,
417.139	and study upon study
417.139	has shown that talk therapy
419.419	combined with medicines, pills,
422.56	really is much more effective
422.56	than either one alone.
425.84	Can we imagine a more immersive
425.84	environment that will change depression?
429.44	Can you lock out the signals
429.44	that elicit depression?
433.52	Again, moving upwards along this
433.52	hierarchical chain of organization.
439.76	What's really at stake perhaps here
442.48	is not the medicine itself but a metaphor.
445.76	Rather than killing something,
447.84	in the case of the great
447.84	chronic degenerative diseases --
451.56	kidney failure, diabetes,
451.56	hypertension, osteoarthritis --
455.08	maybe what we really need to do is change
455.08	the metaphor to growing something.
458.676	And that's the key, perhaps,
460.64	to reframing our thinking about medicine.
463.16	Now, this idea of changing,
466.64	of creating a perceptual
466.64	shift, as it were,
469	came home to me to roost in a very
469	personal manner about 10 years ago.
472.32	About 10 years ago --
472.32	I've been a runner most of my life --
475.12	I went for a run, a Saturday morning run,
477.12	I came back and woke up
477.12	and I basically couldn't move.
479.8	My right knee was swollen up,
481.84	and you could hear that ominous crunch
481.84	of bone against bone.
486.24	And one of the perks of being a physician
486.24	is that you get to order your own MRIs.
491.16	And I had an MRI the next week,
491.16	and it looked like that.
495.16	Essentially, the meniscus of cartilage
495.16	that is between bone
499.48	had been completely torn
499.48	and the bone itself had been shattered.
502.92	Now, if you're looking at me
502.92	and feeling sorry,
505.4	let me tell you a few facts.
507.24	If I was to take an MRI
507.24	of every person in this audience,
513.52	of bone degeneration
513.52	and cartilage degeneration like this.
520.12	would show moderate to severe
520.12	cartilage degeneration.
	of the men in this audience
525.72	would also have such signs.
527.08	So this is a very common disease.
528.88	Well, the second perk of being a physician
531	is that you can get
531	to experiment on your own ailments.
534.159	So about 10 years ago we began,
536.4	we brought this process
536.4	into the laboratory,
538.84	and we began to do simple experiments,
540.88	mechanically trying
540.88	to fix this degeneration.
543.36	We tried to inject chemicals
543.36	into the knee spaces of animals
548.2	to try to reverse cartilage degeneration,
550.88	and to put a short summary
550.88	on a very long and painful process,
555.44	essentially it came to naught.
557.24	Nothing happened.
558.88	And then about seven years ago,
558.88	we had a research student from Australia.
563.68	The nice thing about Australians
565.205	is that they're habitually used to
565.205	looking at the world upside down.
568.546	(Laughter)
569.727	"And so Dan suggested to me, ""You know,"
569.727	maybe it isn't a mechanical problem.
573.84	Maybe it isn't a chemical problem.
573.84	"Maybe it's a stem cell problem."""
579.76	In other words, he had two hypotheses.
581.68	Number one, there is such a thing
581.68	as a skeletal stem cell --
585.52	a skeletal stem cell that builds up
585.52	the entire vertebrate skeleton,
589.064	bone, cartilage and the fibrous
589.064	elements of skeleton,
591.62	just like there's a stem cell in blood,
593.51	just like there's a stem cell
593.51	in the nervous system.
595.969	And two, that maybe that, the degeneration
595.969	or dysfunction of this stem cell
599.554	is what's causing osteochondral arthritis,
599.554	a very common ailment.
603.08	So really the question was,
603.08	were we looking for a pill
606.32	when we should have really
606.32	been looking for a cell.
608.96	So we switched our models,
611.84	and now we began
611.84	to look for skeletal stem cells.
615.56	And to cut again a long story short,
618.08	about five years ago,
618.08	we found these cells.
621.8	They live inside the skeleton.
624.32	Here's a schematic and then
624.32	a real photograph of one of them.
627.24	The white stuff is bone,
629.2	and these red columns that you see
629.2	and the yellow cells
632.24	are cells that have arisen
632.24	from one single skeletal stem cell --
635.52	columns of cartilage, columns of bone
635.52	coming out of a single cell.
638.84	These cells are fascinating.
638.84	They have four properties.
642.16	Number one is that they live
642.16	where they're expected to live.
645.96	They live just underneath
645.96	the surface of the bone,
648.36	underneath cartilage.
649.92	You know, in biology,
649.92	it's location, location, location.
652.564	And they move into the appropriate areas
652.564	and form bone and cartilage.
656.84	That's one.
658.12	Here's an interesting property.
659.68	You can take them out
659.68	of the vertebrate skeleton,
662.36	you can culture them
662.36	in petri dishes in the laboratory,
664.96	and they are dying to form cartilage.
666.96	Remember how we couldn't
666.96	form cartilage for love or money?
669.706	These cells are dying to form cartilage.
671.65	They form their own furls
671.65	of cartilage around themselves.
674.68	They're also, number three,
676.32	the most efficient repairers
676.32	of fractures that we've ever encountered.
680.52	This is a little bone,
680.52	a mouse bone that we fractured
683.84	and then let it heal by itself.
685.4	These stem cells have come in
685.4	and repaired, in yellow, the bone,
688.44	in white, the cartilage,
688.44	almost completely.
691.08	So much so that if you label them
691.08	with a fluorescent dye
694.64	you can see them like some kind
694.64	of peculiar cellular glue
698.4	coming into the area of a fracture,
700.28	fixing it locally
700.28	and then stopping their work.
703.28	Now, the fourth one is the most ominous,
705.64	and that is that their numbers
705.64	decline precipitously,
709.8	precipitously, tenfold,
709.8	fiftyfold, as you age.
714.52	And so what had happened, really,
716.12	is that we found ourselves
716.12	in a perceptual shift.
719	We had gone hunting for pills
721.76	but we ended up finding theories.
724.28	And in some ways
725.52	we had hooked ourselves
725.52	back onto this idea:
728.16	cells, organisms, environments,
731.08	because we were now thinking
731.08	about bone stem cells,
733.68	we were thinking about arthritis
733.68	in terms of a cellular disease.
737.84	And then the next question was,
737.84	are there organs?
740.15	Can you build this
740.15	as an organ outside the body?
742.413	Can you implant cartilage
742.413	into areas of trauma?
746.28	And perhaps most interestingly,
748.28	can you ascend right up
748.28	and create environments?
750.68	You know, we know
750.68	that exercise remodels bone,
753.76	but come on, none of us
753.76	is going to exercise.
756.2	So could you imagine ways of passively
756.2	loading and unloading bone
761.4	so that you can recreate
761.4	or regenerate degenerating cartilage?
766.24	And perhaps more interesting,
766.24	and more importantly,
768.645	the question is, can you apply this model
768.645	more globally outside medicine?
772.12	What's at stake, as I said before,
772.12	is not killing something,
776.2	but growing something.
778.28	And it raises a series of, I think,
778.28	some of the most interesting questions
783.12	about how we think
783.12	about medicine in the future.
787.04	Could your medicine
787.04	be a cell and not a pill?
790.84	How would we grow these cells?
793.24	What we would we do to stop
793.24	the malignant growth of these cells?
796.28	We heard about the problems
796.28	of unleashing growth.
800.2	Could we implant
800.2	suicide genes into these cells
803	to stop them from growing?
805.04	Could your medicine be an organ
805.04	that's created outside the body
809	and then implanted into the body?
810.96	Could that stop some of the degeneration?
813.72	What if the organ needed to have memory?
815.649	In cases of diseases of the nervous system
815.649	some of those organs had memory.
820.44	How could we implant
820.44	those memories back in?
822.92	Could we store these organs?
824.76	Would each organ have to be developed
824.76	for an individual human being
827.927	and put back?
830.52	And perhaps most puzzlingly,
833.16	could your medicine be an environment?
836.16	Could you patent an environment?
837.84	You know, in every culture,
841.32	shamans have been using
841.32	environments as medicines.
844.28	Could we imagine that for our future?
848.08	I've talked a lot about models.
848.08	I began this talk with models.
851.48	So let me end with some thoughts
851.48	about model building.
854.2	That's what we do as scientists.
856.32	You know, when an architect
856.32	builds a model,
859.64	he or she is trying to show you
859.64	a world in miniature.
862.96	But when a scientist is building a model,
865.88	he or she is trying to show you
865.88	the world in metaphor.
869.6	He or she is trying to create
869.6	a new way of seeing.
873.48	The former is a scale shift.
873.48	The latter is a perceptual shift.
878.92	Now, antibiotics created
878.92	such a perceptual shift
883.88	in our way of thinking about medicine
883.88	that it really colored, distorted,
887.72	very successfully, the way we've thought
887.72	about medicine for the last hundred years.
892.4	But we need new models
892.4	to think about medicine in the future.
896.84	That's what's at stake.
899.48	You know, there's
899.48	a popular trope out there
902.84	that the reason we haven't had
902.84	the transformative impact
906.84	on the treatment of illness
908.84	is because we don't have
908.84	powerful-enough drugs,
911.72	and that's partly true.
914.12	But perhaps the real reason is
915.64	that we don't have powerful-enough
915.64	ways of thinking about medicines.
920.56	It's certainly true that
923	it would be lovely to have new medicines.
926.8	But perhaps what's really at stake
926.8	are three more intangible M's:
931.48	mechanisms, models, metaphors.
935.32	Thank you.
936.68	(Applause)
945.6	Chris Anderson:
945.6	I really like this metaphor.
949.04	How does it link in?
950.6	There's a lot of talk in technologyland
953.76	about the personalization of medicine,
955.92	that we have all this data
955.92	and that medical treatments of the future
959.36	will be for you specifically,
959.36	your genome, your current context.
963.88	Does that apply to this model
963.88	you've got here?
967.84	Siddhartha Mukherjee:
967.84	It's a very interesting question.
970.48	We've thought about
970.48	personalization of medicine
972.72	very much in terms of genomics.
974.28	That's because the gene
974.28	is such a dominant metaphor,
976.88	again, to use that same word,
976.88	in medicine today,
979.88	that we think the genome will drive
979.88	the personalization of medicine.
983.64	But of course the genome
983.64	is just the bottom
986.76	of a long chain of being, as it were.
990.6	That chain of being, really the first
990.6	organized unit of that, is the cell.
994.44	So, if we are really going to deliver
994.44	in medicine in this way,
997.44	we have to think of personalizing
997.44	cellular therapies,
1000.28	and then personalizing
1000.28	organ or organismal therapies,
1003.48	and ultimately personalizing
1003.48	immersion therapies for the environment.
1007.32	So I think at every stage, you know --
1010.44	there's that metaphor,
1010.44	there's turtles all the way.
1012.88	Well, in this, there's
1012.88	personalization all the way.
1015.285	CA: So when you say
1015.285	medicine could be a cell
1018.2	and not a pill,
1020.04	you're talking about
1020.04	potentially your own cells.
1022.32	SM: Absolutely.
1022.32	CA: So converted to stem cells,
1024.72	perhaps tested against all kinds
1024.72	of drugs or something, and prepared.
1029.28	SM: And there's no perhaps.
1029.28	This is what we're doing.
1031.84	This is what's happening,
1031.84	and in fact, we're slowly moving,
1035.6	not away from genomics,
1035.6	but incorporating genomics
1039.44	into what we call multi-order,
1039.44	semi-autonomous, self-regulating systems,
1044.2	like cells, like organs,
1044.2	like environments.
1046.829	CA: Thank you so much.
1048.227	SM: Pleasure. Thanks.
