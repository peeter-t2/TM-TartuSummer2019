12.885	So I've been thinking about the difference between
14.407	the résumé virtues and 
14.407	the eulogy virtues.
17.541	The résumé virtues are the
17.541	ones you put on your résumé,
20.443	which are the skills 
20.443	you bring to the marketplace.
23.909	The eulogy virtues are the ones
25.647	that get mentioned in the eulogy,
27.129	which are deeper: who are you, 
27.129	in your depth,
30.067	what is the nature of your relationships,
31.843	are you bold, loving, dependable, consistency?
35.407	And most of us, including 
35.407	me, would say
36.901	that the eulogy virtues are the
36.901	more important of the virtues.
40.127	But at least in my case, 
40.127	are they the ones that
42.2	I think about the most? 
42.2	And the answer is no.
45.002	So I've been thinking about that problem,
47.295	and a thinker who has 
47.295	helped me think about it
48.463	is a guy named Joseph Soloveitchik, who was a rabbi
50.076	"who wrote a book called ""The"
50.076	"Lonely Man Of Faith"" in 1965."
53.446	Soloveitchik said there are two sides of our natures,
56.766	which he called Adam I
56.766	and Adam II.
59.156	Adam I is the worldly, ambitious,
60.888	external side of our nature.
63.111	He wants to build, create,
63.111	create companies,
65.184	create innovation.
66.73	Adam II is the humble
66.73	side of our nature.
69.468	Adam II wants not only 
69.468	to do good but to be good,
72.285	to live in a way internally
74.232	that honors God, creation and our possibilities.
78.035	Adam I wants to conquer the world.
79.923	Adam II wants to hear 
79.923	a calling and obey the world.
82.687	Adam I savors accomplishment.
85.175	Adam II savors inner 
85.175	consistency and strength.
87.857	Adam I asks how things work.
90.6	Adam II asks why we're here.
92.918	"Adam I's motto is ""success."""
95.022	"Adam II's motto is ""love, redemption and return."""
99.268	And Soloveitchik argued 
99.268	that these two sides
101.118	of our nature are 
101.118	at war with each other.
103.766	We live in perpetual self-confrontation
105.83	between the external success and the internal value.
109.094	And the tricky thing, 
109.094	I'd say, about these
111.578	two sides of our nature is they work
113.27	by different logics.
115.68	The external logic is 
115.68	an economic logic:
117.914	input leads to output, 
117.914	risk leads to reward.
121.38	The internal side of our nature
123.156	is a moral logic and 
123.156	often an inverse logic.
126.577	You have to give to receive.
128.451	You have to surrender 
128.451	to something outside yourself
130.167	to gain strength within yourself.
132.449	You have to conquer the
132.449	desire to get what you want.
134.77	In order to fulfill yourself,
134.77	you have to forget yourself.
137.561	In order to find yourself, 
137.561	you have to lose yourself.
141.873	We happen to live in a society 
141.873	that favors Adam I,
144.809	and often neglects Adam II.
147.049	And the problem is, that turns
147.049	you into a shrewd animal
150.281	who treats life as a game,
151.838	and you become a cold, 
151.838	calculating creature
154.563	who slips into a sort of mediocrity
157.369	where you realize there's a difference
158.829	between your desired 
158.829	self and your actual self.
161.401	You're not earning the sort of eulogy you want,
165.374	you hope someone will give to you.
166.934	You don't have the 
166.934	depth of conviction.
168.66	You don't have an emotional sonorousness.
171.197	You don't have 
171.197	commitment to tasks
172.966	that would take more than a lifetime to commit.
176.18	I was reminded of a common
176.18	response through history
179.627	of how you build a solid Adam II,
182.389	how you build a depth of character.
184.399	Through history, people 
184.399	have gone back
187.124	into their own pasts,
189.01	sometimes to a precious 
189.01	time in their life,
191.26	to their childhood,
192.719	and often, the mind 
192.719	gravitates in the past
196.685	to a moment of shame,
198.073	some sin committed, 
198.073	some act of selfishness,
201	an act of omission, of shallowness,
203.29	the sin of anger, the sin of self-pity,
206.033	trying to be a people-pleaser, 
206.033	a lack of courage.
209.618	Adam I is built by 
209.618	building on your strengths.
214.313	Adam II is built by fighting 
214.313	your weaknesses.
218.409	You go into yourself, 
218.409	you find the sin
221.267	which you've committed over
221.267	and again through your life,
222.939	your signature sin
224.74	out of which the others emerge,
227.431	and you fight that sin and you wrestle with that sin,
230.295	and out of that wrestling, 
230.295	that suffering,
233.431	then a depth of character is constructed.
237.049	And we're often not
237.049	taught to recognize
238.951	the sin in ourselves,
240.087	in that we're not taught in this culture
241.935	how to wrestle with it,
243.882	how to confront it, 
243.882	and how to combat it.
246.555	We live in a culture 
246.555	with an Adam I mentality
249.885	where we're inarticulate 
249.885	about Adam II.
253.054	Finally, Reinhold Niebuhr
254.71	summed up the confrontation, the fully lived
256.845	Adam I and Adam II life, this way:
260.398	"""Nothing that is worth doing"
260.398	can be achieved in our lifetime;
263.66	therefore we must 
263.66	be saved by hope.
266.042	Nothing which is true or
266.042	beautiful or good makes
269.148	complete sense in any immediate context of history;
272.104	therefore we must be saved by faith.
274.782	Nothing we do, however virtuous,
274.782	can be accomplished alone;
278.672	therefore we must 
278.672	be saved by love.
281.718	No virtuous act is quite as virtuous
284.155	from the standpoint of our friend
284.155	or foe as from our own standpoint.
288.141	Therefore we must be saved 
288.141	by that final form of love,
290.968	which is forgiveness.”
292.604	Thanks.
294.68	(Applause)
