16.404	Across Europe and Central Asia,
19.13	approximately one million children live in large
21.69	residential institutions, usually known as orphanages.
25.788	Most people imagine orphanages as a benign environment
28.846	that care for children.
30.517	Others know more about the living conditions there,
33.748	but still think they're a necessary evil.
36.2	After all, where else would we put all of those children
39.597	who don't have any parents?
41.748	But 60 years of research has demonstrated
45.215	that separating children from their families
47.471	and placing them in large institutions
49.823	seriously harms their health and development,
52.663	and this is particularly true for young babies.
56.145	As we know, babies are born
58.289	without their full muscle development,
61.049	and that includes the brain.
62.973	During the first three years of life, the brain grows
65.633	to its full size, with most of that growth taking place
68.403	in the first six months. The brain develops
71.023	in response to experience and to stimulation.
74.249	Every time a young baby learns something new --
78.063	to focus its eyes,
79.59	to mimic a movement or a facial expression,
82.583	to pick something up, to form a word or to sit up --
86.573	new synaptic connections are being built in the brain.
90.15	New parents are astonished by the rapidity of this learning.
94.249	They are quite rightly amazed and delighted by their children's cleverness.
99.157	They communicate their delight to their children,
101.741	who respond with smiles,
103.462	and a desire to achieve more and to learn more.
107.864	This forming of the powerful attachment between child and parent
111.606	provides the building blocks for physical, social,
114.817	language, cognitive and psychomotor development.
118.327	It is the model for all future relationships with friends,
122.541	with partners and with their own children.
125.782	It happens so naturally in most families
128.198	that we don't even notice it. Most of us are unaware
131.302	of its importance to human development and, by extension,
134.732	to the development of a healthy society.
137.631	And it's only when it goes wrong that we start to realize
140.173	the importance of families to children.
143.182	In August, 1993, I had my first opportunity to witness
147.118	on a massive scale the impact on children
151.276	of institutionalization and the absence of parenting.
155.679	Those of us who remember the newspaper reports
158.116	that came out of Romania after the 1989 revolution
161.37	will recall the horrors of the conditions in some of those institutions.
165.791	I was asked to help the director of a large institution to
168.55	help prevent the separation of children from their families.
172.513	Housing 550 babies, this was Ceausescu's show orphanage,
176.698	and so I'd been told the conditions were much better.
179.616	Having worked with lots of young children, I expected
182.066	the institution to be a riot of noise,
184.682	but it was as silent as a convent.
186.545	It was hard to believe there were any children there at all,
189.991	yet the director showed me into room after room,
192.627	each containing row upon row of cots,
195.642	in each of which lay a child staring into space.
201.658	In a room of 40 newborns, not one of them was crying.
205.308	Yet I could see soiled nappies, and I could see
207.347	that some of the children were distressed,
208.919	but the only noise was a low, continuous moan.
212.764	The head nurse told me proudly,
214.864	"""You see, our children are very well-behaved."""
218.085	Over the next few days, I began to realize
220.828	that this quietness was not exceptional.
222.891	The newly admitted babies would cry for the first few hours,
226.664	but their demands were not met, and so eventually
228.653	they learned not to bother. Within a few days,
231.331	they were listless, lethargic, and staring into space
234.827	like all the others.
236.653	Over the years, many people and news reports
239.57	have blamed the personnel in the institutions
241.741	for the harm caused to the children, but often, one member
244.595	of staff is caring for 10, 20, and even 40 children.
249.162	Hence they have no option but to implement a regimented program.
253.224	The children must be woken at 7 and fed at 7:30.
257.099	At 8, their nappies must be changed, so a staff member
259.611	may have only 30 minutes to feed 10 or 20 children.
262.976	If a child soils its nappy at 8:30, he will have to wait
266.672	several hours before it can be changed again.
269.631	The child's daily contact with another human being
272.28	is reduced to a few hurried minutes of feeding and changing,
276.748	and otherwise their only stimulation is the ceiling,
279.648	the walls or the bars of their cots.
283.78	Since my first visit to Ceausescu's institution,
286.679	I've seen hundreds of such places across 18 countries,
289.812	from the Czech Republic to Sudan.
292.604	Across all of these diverse lands and cultures,
295.588	the institutions, and the child's journey through them,
298.885	is depressingly similar.
301.478	Lack of stimulation often leads to self-stimulating behaviors
304.588	like hand-flapping, rocking back and forth,
307.529	or aggression, and in some institutions, psychiatric drugs
311.34	are used to control the behavior of these children,
314.171	whilst in others, children are tied up to prevent them
316.372	from harming themselves or others.
319.26	These children are quickly labeled as having disabilities
321.752	and transferred to another institution for children with disabilities.
325.187	Most of these children will never leave the institution again.
329.53	For those without disabilities, at age three,
332.193	they're transferred to another institution, and at age seven,
334.741	to yet another. Segregated according to age and gender,
338.694	they are arbitrarily separated from their siblings,
341.239	often without even a chance to say goodbye.
345.127	There's rarely enough to eat. They are often hungry.
347.905	The older children bully the little ones. They learn to
350.615	survive. They learn to defend themselves, or they go under.
353.964	When they leave the institution, they find it really difficult
357.524	to cope and to integrate into society.
360.819	In Moldova, young women raised in institutions
364.068	are 10 times more likely to be trafficked than their peers,
368.076	and a Russian study found that two years after leaving institutions,
372.232	young adults, 20 percent of them had a criminal record,
379.447	and 10 percent had taken their own lives.
384.011	But why are there so many orphans in Europe
386.892	when there hasn't been a great deal of war or disaster in recent years?
390.763	In fact, more than 95 percent of these children have living parents,
395.347	and societies tend to blame these parents
397.336	for abandoning these children, but research shows that
400.099	most parents want their children, and that the primary drivers
403.22	behind institutionalization
405.539	are poverty, disability and ethnicity.
409.736	Many countries have not developed inclusive schools,
412.835	and so even children with a very mild disability
415.539	are sent away to a residential special school,
418.115	at age six or seven.
419.923	The institution may be hundreds of miles away from the family home.
424.057	If the family's poor, they find it difficult to visit,
426.781	and gradually the relationship breaks down.
430.899	Behind each of the million children in institutions,
434.202	there is usually a story of parents who are desperate
437.956	and feel they've run out of options, like Natalia in Moldova,
443.066	who only had enough money to feed her baby,
445.459	and so had to send her older son to the institution;
448.643	or Desi, in Bulgaria, who looked after her four children
451.683	at home until her husband died,
454.312	but then she had to go out to work full time,
456.555	and with no support, felt she had no option
458.702	but to place a child with disabilities in an institution;
462.534	or the countless young girls too terrified to tell their parents
465.688	they're pregnant, who leave their babies in a hospital;
469.274	or the new parents, the young couple who have
472.006	just found out that their firstborn child has a disability,
476.512	and instead of being provided with positive messages
479.567	about their child's potential, are told by the doctors,
482.414	"""Forget her, leave her in the institution,"
485.47	"go home and make a healthy one."""
488.99	This state of affairs is neither necessary nor is it inevitable.
492.522	Every child has the right to a family, deserves
495.649	and needs a family, and children are amazingly resilient.
499.48	We find that if we get them out of institutions and into loving
502.162	families early on, they recover their developmental delays,
505.683	and go on to lead normal, happy lives.
508.726	It's also much cheaper to provide support to families
512.287	than it is to provide institutions.
514.806	One study suggests that a family support service
518.002	costs 10 percent of an institutional placement,
520.91	whilst good quality foster care
523.174	costs usually about 30 percent.
526.166	If we spend less on these children but on the right services,
529.214	we can take the savings and reinvest them in high quality
533.166	residential care for those few children with extremely complex needs.
537.815	Across Europe, a movement is growing to shift the focus
542.352	and transfer the resources from large institutions
545.188	that provide poor quality care to community-based services
549.148	that protect children from harm and allow them to develop
551.873	to their full potential. When I first started to work in Romania
555.7	nearly 20 years ago, there were 200,000 children living
559.476	in institutions, and more entering every day.
563.037	Now, there are less than 10,000, and
565.348	family support services are provided across the country.
568.796	In Moldova, despite extreme poverty and the terrible effects
572.582	of the global financial crisis, the numbers of children
575.574	in institutions has reduced by more than 50 percent
578.358	in the last five years, and the resources are being
581.574	redistributed to family support services and inclusive schools.
586.227	Many countries have developed national action plans for change.
589.457	The European Commission and other major donors
591.978	are finding ways to divert money from institutions
595.458	towards family support, empowering communities
598.454	to look after their own children.
601.183	But there is still much to be done to end the systematic
603.986	institutionalization of children.
606.354	Awareness-raising is required at every level of society.
609.423	People need to know the harm that institutions cause to children,
612.947	and the better alternatives that exist.
615.907	If we know people who are planning to support orphanages,
618.871	we should convince them to support family services instead.
622.913	Together, this is the one form of child abuse
626.175	that we could eradicate in our lifetime.
629.039	Thank you. (Applause)
