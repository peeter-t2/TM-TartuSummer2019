12.972	Okay, it's great to be back at TED.
15.115	Why don't I just start by firing away with the video?
17.699	(Music)
22.442	(Video) Man: Okay, Glass, record a video.
27.573	Woman: This is it. We're on in two minutes.
31.464	Man 2: Okay Glass, hang out with The Flying Club.
35.284	"Man 3: Google ""photos of tiger heads."" Hmm."
40.033	Man 4: You ready? You ready? (Barking)
42.437	Woman 2: Right there. Okay, Glass, take a picture.
48.981	(Child shouting)
58.655	Man 5: Go!
63.556	Man 6: Holy [beep]! That is awesome.
66.735	Child: Whoa! Look at that snake!
69.37	Woman 3: Okay, Glass, record a video!
78.678	Man 7: After this bridge, first exit.
105.813	Man 8: Okay, A12, right there!
109.164	(Applause)
112.405	(Children singing)
118.81	"Man 9: Google, say ""delicious"" in Thai."
122.228	Google Glass: อร่อยMan 9: Mmm, อร่อย.
125.441	"Woman 4: Google ""jellyfish."""
129.473	(Music)
140.793	Man 10: It's beautiful.
143.73	(Applause)
151.473	Sergey Brin: Oh, sorry, I just got this message from a Nigerian prince.
157.377	He needs help getting 10 million dollars.
162.028	I like to pay attention to these
163.278	because that's how we originally funded the company,
165.946	and it's gone pretty well.
170.067	Though in all seriousness,
171.793	this position that you just saw me in,
174.985	looking down at my phone,
177.417	that's one of the reasons behind this project, Project Glass.
181.609	Because we ultimately questioned
184.191	whether this is the ultimate future
186.707	of how you want to connect to other people in your life,
189.697	how you want to connect to information.
192.051	Should it be by just walking around looking down?
195.745	But that was the vision behind Glass,
198.633	and that's why we've created this form factor.
207.223	Okay. And I don't want to go through all the things it does and whatnot,
213.955	but I want to tell you a little bit more
215.323	about the motivation behind what led to it.
219.021	In addition to potentially socially isolating yourself
223.282	when you're out and about looking at your phone,
225.839	it's kind of, is this what you're meant to do with your body?
230.697	You're standing around there
232.33	and you're just rubbing
233.698	this featureless piece of glass.
235.531	You're just kind of moving around.
238.255	So when we developed Glass, we thought really about,
241.724	can we make something that frees your hands?
244.921	You saw all of the things people are doing
246.404	in the video back there.
247.947	They were all wearing Glass,
249.032	and that's how we got that footage.
252.087	And also you want something that frees your eyes.
255.186	That's why we put the display up high,
257.908	out of your line of sight,
259.357	so it wouldn't be where you're looking
262.084	and it wouldn't be where you're making
263.184	eye contact with people.
265.305	And also we wanted to free up the ears,
268.183	so the sound actually goes through,
272.189	conducts straight to the bones in your cranium,
275.686	which is a little bit freaky at first, but you get used to it.
279.23	And ironically, if you want to hear it better,
281.693	you actually just cover your ear,
284.334	which is kind of surprising, but that's how it works.
289.446	My vision when we started Google 15 years ago
292.487	was that eventually you wouldn't
293.804	have to have a search query at all.
297.277	You'd just have information come to you as you needed it.
300.567	And this is now, 15 years later,
302.965	sort of the first form factor
305.405	that I think can deliver that vision
307.07	when you're out and about on the street
308.745	talking to people and so forth.
312.501	This project has lasted now, been just over two years.
316.047	We've learned an amazing amount.
318.557	It's been really important to make it comfortable.
321.573	So our first prototypes we built were huge.
325.652	It was like cell phones strapped to your head.
327.861	It was very heavy, pretty uncomfortable.
330.92	We had to keep it secret from our industrial designer
334.121	until she actually accepted the job,
335.925	and then she almost ran away screaming.
339.209	But we've come a long way.
341.781	And the other really unexpected surprise was the camera.
344.869	Our original prototypes didn't have cameras at all,
347.366	but it's been really magical to be able to capture moments
350.531	spent with my family, my kids.
353.093	I just never would have dug out a camera
355.726	or a phone or something else to take that moment.
358.285	And lastly I've realized, in experimenting with this device,
363.334	that I also kind of have a nervous tic.
367.399	The cell phone is -- yeah, you have to look down on it and all that,
371.443	but it's also kind of a nervous habit.
373.94	Like if I smoked, I'd probably just smoke instead.
376.887	I would just light up a cigarette. It would look cooler.
379.305	You know, I'd be like --
382.726	But in this case, you know, I whip this out
384.801	and I sit there and look as if I have something
386.829	very important to do or attend to.
389.642	But it really opened my eyes to how much of my life
392.866	I spent just secluding away,
397.271	be it email or social posts or whatnot,
400.483	even though it wasn't really --
401.93	there's nothing really that important or that pressing.
404.911	And with this, I know I will get certain messages
407.614	if I really need them,
409.116	but I don't have to be checking them all the time.
413.211	Yeah, I've really enjoyed actually exploring the world more,
416.191	doing more of the crazy things like you saw in the video.
420.912	Thank you all very much.
422.94	(Applause)
