15.948	Fifteen years ago, it was widely assumed
18.837	that the vast majority of brain development
20.887	takes place in the first few years of life.
23.866	Back then, 15 years ago, we didn't have the ability
26.578	to look inside the living human brain
29.199	and track development across the lifespan.
32.237	In the past decade or so, mainly due to advances
35.398	in brain imaging technology
37.203	such as magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI,
40.146	neuroscientists have started to look inside the living
43.273	human brain of all ages, and to track changes
45.692	in brain structure and brain function,
48.563	so we use structural MRI if you'd like to take a snapshot,
52.24	a photograph, at really high resolution of the inside
55.302	of the living human brain, and we can ask questions like,
58.522	how much gray matter does the brain contain,
60.962	and how does that change with age?
62.765	And we also use functional MRI, called fMRI,
66.477	to take a video, a movie, of brain activity
69.872	when participants are taking part in some kind of task
72.74	like thinking or feeling or perceiving something.
75.632	So many labs around the world are involved in this kind
78.398	of research, and we now have a really rich
80.628	and detailed picture of how the living human brain develops,
84.152	and this picture has radically changed the way
87.22	we think about human brain development
89.853	by revealing that it's not all over in early childhood,
92.621	and instead, the brain continues to develop
95.332	right throughout adolescence and into the '20s and '30s.
99.378	So adolescence is defined as the period of life that starts
103.357	with the biological, hormonal, physical changes of puberty
107.753	and ends at the age at which an individual attains
111.038	a stable, independent role in society.
114.489	(Laughter)
116.279	It can go on a long time. (Laughter)
119.044	One of the brain regions that changes most dramatically
122.063	during adolescence is called prefrontal cortex.
125.327	So this is a model of the human brain,
128.304	and this is prefrontal cortex, right at the front.
131.184	Prefrontal cortex is an interesting brain area.
133.693	It's proportionally much bigger in humans than
136.807	in any other species, and it's involved in a whole range of
140.45	high level cognitive functions, things like decision-making,
143.722	planning, planning what you're going to do tomorrow
145.812	or next week or next year, inhibiting
148.552	inappropriate behavior, so stopping yourself saying
151.218	something really rude or doing something really stupid.
154.143	It's also involved in social interaction,
155.921	understanding other people, and self-awareness.
159.045	So MRI studies looking at the development of this region
162.095	have shown that it really undergoes dramatic development
164.565	during the period of adolescence.
167.498	So if you look at gray matter volume, for example,
170.456	gray matter volume across age from age four to 22 years
175.305	increases during childhood, which is what you can see
177.627	on this graph. It peaks in early adolescence.
181.38	The arrows indicate peak gray matter volume
183.945	in prefrontal cortex. You can see that that peak happens
187.411	a couple of years later in boys relative to girls,
190.921	and that's probably because boys go through puberty
192.76	a couple of years later than girls on average,
195.012	and then during adolescence, there's a significant decline
198.447	in gray matter volume in prefrontal cortex.
201.132	Now that might sound bad, but actually this is
203.157	a really important developmental process, because
206.307	gray matter contains cell bodies and connections
210.413	between cells, the synapses, and this decline
213.867	in gray matter volume during prefrontal cortex
216.612	is thought to correspond to synaptic pruning,
219.504	the elimination of unwanted synapses.
221.827	This is a really important process. It's partly dependent
224.96	on the environment that the animal or the human is in,
228.094	and the synapses that are being used are strengthened,
231.538	and synapses that aren't being used
233.471	in that particular environment are pruned away.
235.803	You can think of it a bit like pruning a rosebush.
238.309	You prune away the weaker branches so that
241.149	the remaining, important branches, can grow stronger,
244.187	and this process, which effectively fine-tunes brain tissue
248.113	according to the species-specific environment,
250.78	is happening in prefrontal cortex and in other brain regions
253.695	during the period of human adolescence.
257.249	So a second line of inquiry that we use to track changes
260.95	in the adolescent brain is using functional MRI
264.202	to look at changes in brain activity across age.
267.475	So I'll just give you an example from my lab.
269.117	So in my lab, we're interested in the social brain, that is
272.678	the network of brain regions that we use to understand
276.262	other people and to interact with other people.
278.695	So I like to show a photograph of a soccer game
282.461	to illustrate two aspects of how your social brains work.
286.868	So this is a soccer game. (Laughter)
288.301	Michael Owen has just missed a goal, and he's lying
290.943	on the ground, and the first aspect of the social brain
293.745	that this picture really nicely illustrates is how automatic
296.704	and instinctive social emotional responses are,
299.754	so within a split second of Michael Owen missing this goal,
302.718	everyone is doing the same thing with their arms
304.528	and the same thing with their face, even Michael Owen
306.331	as he slides along the grass, is doing the same thing
308.155	with his arms, and presumably has a similar
310.424	facial expression, and the only people who don't
312.398	are the guys in yellow at the back — (Laughs) —
315.859	and I think they're on the wrong end of the stadium,
318.402	and they're doing another social emotional response
320.697	that we all instantly recognize, and that's the second aspect
323.332	of the social brain that this picture really nicely illustrates,
326.968	how good we are at reading other people's behavior,
330.35	their actions, their gestures, their facial expressions,
333.027	in terms of their underlying emotions and mental states.
336.843	So you don't have to ask any of these guys.
338.62	You have a pretty good idea of what they're feeling
341.161	and thinking at this precise moment in time.
343.749	So that's what we're interested in looking at in my lab.
345.505	So in my lab, we bring adolescents and adults into the lab
349.093	to have a brain scan, we give them some kind of task
351.478	that involves thinking about other people, their minds,
354.772	their mental states, their emotions, and one of the findings
357.666	that we've found several times now, as have other labs
360.512	around the world, is part of the prefrontal cortex called
363.73	medial prefrontal cortex, which is shown in blue on the slide,
366.948	and it's right in the middle of prefrontal cortex
369.704	in the midline of your head.
372.102	This region is more active in adolescents when they make
375.385	these social decisions and think about other people
377.512	than it is in adults, and this is actually a meta-analysis
380.313	of nine different studies in this area from labs around
383.553	the world, and they all show the same thing, that activity
386.253	in this medial prefrontal cortex area decreases
389.623	during the period of adolescence.
392.07	And we think that might be because adolescents and adults
394.714	use a different mental approach, a different
397.08	cognitive strategy, to make social decisions,
400.498	and one way of looking at that is to do behavioral studies
404.014	whereby we bring people into the lab and we give them
405.991	some kind of behavioral task, and I'll just give you
408.535	another example of the kind of task that we use in my lab.
411.745	So imagine that you're the participant in one of our
414.393	experiments. You come into the lab,
416.118	you see this computerized task.
418.792	In this task, you see a set of shelves.
421.582	Now, there are objects on these shelves, on some of them,
424.399	and you'll notice there's a guy standing behind the set
427.37	of shelves, and there are some objects that he can't see.
430.955	They're occluded, from his point of view, with a kind of
433.234	gray piece of wood.
435.878	This is the same set of shelves from his point of view.
439.362	Notice that there are only some objects that he can see,
442.855	whereas there are many more objects that you can see.
445.307	Now your task is to move objects around.
447.503	The director, standing behind the set of shelves,
449.865	is going to direct you to move objects around,
452.61	but remember, he's not going to ask you to move objects
454.504	that he can't see. This introduces a really interesting
458.224	condition whereby there's a kind of conflict
460.417	between your perspective and the director's perspective.
463.585	So imagine he tells you to move the top truck left.
466.825	There are three trucks there. You're going to instinctively
468.871	go for the white truck, because that's the top truck
471.021	from your perspective, but then you have to remember,
473.839	"""Oh, he can't see that truck, so he must mean"
475.898	"me to move the blue truck,"" which is the top truck"
478.655	from his perspective. Now believe it or not,
481.3	normal, healthy, intelligent adults like you make errors
484.251	about 50 percent of the time on that kind of trial.
487.391	They move the white truck instead of the blue truck.
490.234	So we give this kind of task to adolescents and adults,
493.55	and we also have a control condition
495.104	where there's no director and instead we give people a rule.
499.165	We tell them, okay, we're going to do exactly the same thing
501.079	but this time there's no director. Instead you've got to
503.916	ignore objects with the dark gray background.
507.123	You'll see that this is exactly the same condition, only
509.823	in the no-director condition they just have to remember
512.669	to apply this somewhat arbitrary rule, whereas
515.74	in the director condition, they have to remember
517.42	to take into account the director's perspective
520.961	in order to guide their ongoing behavior.
525.258	Okay, so if I just show you the percentage errors
527.868	in a large developmental study we did,
530.434	this is in a study ranging from age seven to adulthood,
533.988	and what you're going to see is the percentage errors
535.198	in the adult group in both conditions,
537.187	so the gray is the director condition, and you see
540.458	that our intelligent adults are making errors about 50 percent
543.031	of the time, whereas they make far fewer errors
545.746	when there's no director present, when they just have
547.774	to remember that rule of ignoring the gray background.
550.855	Developmentally, these two conditions develop
553.523	in exactly the same way. Between late childhood
556.446	and mid-adolescence, there's an improvement,
558.687	in other words a reduction of errors, in both of these trials,
562.038	in both of these conditions.
563.158	But it's when you compare the last two groups,
565.443	the mid-adolescent group and the adult group
567.395	where things get really interesting, because there, there is
570.555	no continued improvement in the no-director condition.
573.593	In other words, everything you need to do in order to
576.523	remember the rule and apply it seems to be fully developed
579.229	by mid-adolescence, whereas in contrast,
581.76	if you look at the last two gray bars, there's still
584.157	a significant improvement in the director condition
587.307	between mid-adolescence and adulthood, and what
589.748	this means is that the ability to take into account someone
593.124	else's perspective in order to guide ongoing behavior,
596.409	which is something, by the way, that we do in everyday life all
598.668	the time, is still developing in mid-to-late adolescence.
603.274	So if you have a teenage son or a daughter and you
605.814	sometimes think they have problems taking other people's
608.223	perspectives, you're right. They do. And this is why.
611.979	So we sometimes laugh about teenagers.
615.492	They're parodied, sometimes even demonized in the media
619.355	for their kind of typical teenage behavior. They take risks,
622.882	they're sometimes moody, they're very self-conscious.
625.653	I have a really nice anecdote from a friend of mine
628.146	who said that the thing he noticed most
630.633	about his teenage daughters before and after puberty
633.614	was their level of embarrassment in front of him.
635.874	"So, he said, ""Before puberty, if my two daughters"
638.363	were messing around in a shop, I'd say, 'Hey,
640.617	stop messing around and I'll sing your favorite song,'
642.366	and instantly they'd stop messing around and he'd sing
644.267	their favorite song. After puberty, that became the threat.
647.738	(Laughter)
649.555	The very notion of their dad singing in public
653.032	was enough to make them behave.
655.395	So people often ask,
656.823	"""Well, is adolescence a kind of recent phenomenon?"
659.456	"Is it something we've invented recently in the West?"""
661.578	And actually, the answer is probably not. There are lots
664.246	of descriptions of adolescence in history that sound
667.669	very similar to the descriptions we use today.
669.826	"So there's a famous quote by Shakespeare from ""The Winter's Tale"""
674.059	where he describes adolescence as follows:
676.834	"""I would there were no age between ten and"
679.68	three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the rest;
682.92	for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches
685.011	"with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing, fighting."" (Laughter)"
691.234	"He then goes on to say, ""Having said that, would any"
695.768	but these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty
698.913	"hunt in this weather?"" (Laughter)"
701.411	So almost 400 years ago, Shakespeare was portraying
704.337	adolescents in a very similar light to the light that we
707.061	portray them in today, but today we try to understand
710.52	their behavior in terms of the underlying changes
713.607	that are going on in their brain.
715.545	So for example, take risk-taking. We know that adolescents
719.153	have a tendency to take risks. They do.
721.478	They take more risks than children or adults,
724.11	and they are particularly prone to taking risks
726.57	when they're with their friends. There's an important drive
729.538	to become independent from one's parents
732.024	and to impress one's friends in adolescence.
734.848	But now we try to understand that in terms of
737.447	the development of a part of their brain called the limbic system,
740.44	so I'm going to show you the limbic system in red
742.983	in the slide behind me, and also on this brain.
744.848	So the limbic system is right deep inside the brain,
747.957	and it's involved in things like emotion processing
751.69	and reward processing. It gives you the rewarding feeling
754.84	out of doing fun things, including taking risks.
758.136	It gives you the kick out of taking risks.
760.501	And this region, the regions within the limbic system,
763.549	have been found to be hypersensitive to the rewarding
766.968	feeling of risk-taking in adolescents compared with adults,
770.737	and at the very same time, the prefrontal cortex,
774.439	which you can see in blue in the slide here,
776.713	which stops us taking excessive risks,
779.58	is still very much in development in adolescents.
782.978	So brain research has shown that the adolescent brain
786.645	undergoes really quite profound development,
789.987	and this has implications for education, for rehabilitation,
793.943	and intervention. The environment, including teaching,
797.963	can and does shape the developing adolescent brain,
801.372	and yet it's only relatively recently that we have been
804.174	routinely educating teenagers in the West.
806.679	All four of my grandparents, for example, left school
810.432	in their early adolescence. They had no choice.
814.266	And that's still the case for many, many teenagers
817.04	around the world today. Forty percent of teenagers
820.207	don't have access to secondary school education.
824.429	And yet, this is a period of life where the brain is
827.068	particularly adaptable and malleable.
829.915	It's a fantastic opportunity for learning and creativity.
833.685	So what's sometimes seen as the problem
835.918	with adolescents — heightened risk-taking, poor impulse
838.394	control, self-consciousness — shouldn't be stigmatized.
842.336	It actually reflects changes in the brain that provide
845.173	an excellent opportunity for education
848.087	and social development. Thank you. (Applause)
852.517	(Applause)
