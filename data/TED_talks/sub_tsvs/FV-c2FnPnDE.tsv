12.581	I'm a man who's trying to live from his heart,
16.289	and so just before I get going,
19.354	I wanted to tell you as a South African
21.925	that one of the men who has inspired me most
24.909	passed away a few hours ago.
27.975	Nelson Mandela has come to the end
30.665	of his long walk to freedom.
33.345	And so this talk is going to be for him.
40.544	I grew up in wonder.
43.354	I grew up amongst those animals.
47.469	I grew up in the wild eastern part of South Africa
51.86	at a place called Londolozi Game Reserve.
54.758	It's a place where my family has been
57.53	in the safari business for four generations.
61.725	Now for as long as I can remember,
63.962	my job has been to take people out into nature,
68.699	and so I think it's a lovely twist of fate today
71.61	to have the opportunity
73.43	to bring some of my experiences out in nature
76.311	in to this gathering.
78.451	Africa is a place
80.33	where people still sit under starlit skies
83.714	and around campfires and tell stories,
87.124	and so what I have to share with you today
89.815	is the simple medicine of a few campfire stories,
94.234	stories about heroes of heart.
97.372	Now my stories are not the stories
99.492	that you'll hear on the news,
101.19	and while it's true that Africa is a harsh place,
104.163	I also know it to be a place
106.1	where people, animals and ecosystems
110.366	teach us about a more interconnected world.
114.753	When I was nine years old,
116.731	President Mandela came to stay with my family.
119.965	He had just been released from
119.965	his 27 years of incarceration,
123.389	and was in a period of readjustment
126.016	to his sudden global icon status.
128.675	Members of the African National Congress
131.175	thought that in the bush
133.166	he would have time to rest and recuperate
135.4	away from the public eye,
137.161	and it's true that lions tend to be
140.54	a very good deterrent to press and paparazzi.
144.771	(Laughter)
146.9	But it was a defining time for me as a young boy.
149.446	I would take him breakfast in bed,
151.507	and then, in an old track suit and slippers,
153.875	he would go for a walk around the garden.
156.48	At night, I would sit with my family
158.158	around the snowy, bunny-eared TV,
160.659	and watch images of that same
163.077	quiet man from the garden
165.011	surrounded by hundreds and thousands of people
168.061	as scenes from his release were broadcast nightly.
171.32	He was bringing peace
173.272	to a divided and violent South Africa,
176.154	one man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity.
181.383	Mandela said often that the gift of prison
184.147	was the ability to go within and to think,
187.107	to create in himself
188.836	the things he most wanted for South Africa:
191.715	peace, reconciliation, harmony.
195.06	Through this act of immense open-heartedness,
197.915	he was to become the embodiment
200.147	"of what in South Africa we call ""ubuntu."""
203.686	Ubuntu: I am because of you.
206.535	Or, people are not people
209.198	without other people.
211.923	It's not a new idea or value
213.769	but it's one that I certainly think at these times
215.624	is worth building on.
217.373	In fact, it is said that in the
217.373	collective consciousness of Africa,
220.537	we get to experience the deepest parts
222.576	of our own humanity
223.881	through our interactions with others.
226.665	Ubuntu is at play right now.
228.777	You are holding a space for me
230.777	to express the deepest truth of who I am.
234.169	Without you, I'm just a guy talking to an empty room,
236.429	and I spent a lot of time last week doing that,
239.507	and it's not the same as this.
242.83	(Laughter)
245.256	If Mandela was the national
245.256	and international embodiment,
248.704	then the man who taught me the most
250.298	about this value personally was this man,
252.901	Solly Mhlongo.
254.259	Solly was born under a tree
258.853	He would never have a lot of money,
260.353	but he was to be
261.775	one of the richest men I would ever meet.
264.404	Solly grew up tending to his father's cattle.
267.123	Now, I can tell you, I don't know what it is
267.123	about people who grow up looking after cattle,
271.305	but it makes for über-resourcefulness.
274.327	The first job that he ever got in the safari business
276.801	was fixing the safari trucks.
279.017	Where he had learned to do that out in the bush
281.671	I have no idea, but he could do it.
283.8	He then moved across into what we called
285.727	the habitat team.
287.114	These were the people on the reserve
289	who were responsible for its well-being.
291.357	He fixed roads, he mended wetlands,
293.641	he did some anti-poaching.
295.459	And then one day we were out together,
297.585	and he came across the tracks of where
297.585	a female leopard had walked.
301.116	And it was an old track,
302.89	but for fun he turned and he began to follow it,
305.331	and I tell you, I could tell by the speed
306.906	at which he moved on those pad marks
308.603	that this man was a Ph.D.-level tracker.
312.577	If you drove past Solly
314.351	somewhere out on the reserve,
316.029	you look up in your rearview mirror,
317.678	you'd see he'd stopped the car
321.569	just in case you need help with something.
324.582	The only accusation I ever heard leveled at him
327.335	was when one of our clients said,
328.73	"""Solly, you are pathologically helpful."""
331.947	(Laughter)
334.394	When I started professionally guiding people
337.285	out into this environment,
338.942	Solly was my tracker.
340.502	We worked together as a team.
342.321	And the first guests we ever got
344.347	were a philanthropy group from your East Coast,
347.194	and they said to Solly, on the side, they said,
349.548	"""Before we even go out to see lions and leopards,"
352.189	"we want to see where you live."""
354.251	So we took them up to his house,
355.716	and this visit of the philanthropist to his house
358.588	coincided with a time when Solly's wife,
361.269	who was learning English,
362.869	was going through a phase
362.869	where she would open the door
365.053	"by saying, ""Hello, I love you."
367.717	"Welcome, I love you."" (Laughter)"
369.932	And there was something so beautifully African
372.481	about it to me, this small house
374.326	with a huge heart in it.
376.911	Now on the day that Solly saved my life,
383.486	he was already my hero.
385.497	It was a hot day,
387.078	and we found ourselves down by the river.
389.052	Because of the heat, I took my shoes off,
391.888	and I rolled up my pants,
393.591	and I walked into the water.
395.832	Solly remained on the bank.
397.394	The water was clear running over sand,
400.417	and we turned and we began
400.417	to make our way upstream.
403.731	And a few meters ahead of us,
405.551	there was a place where a tree
405.551	had fallen out of the bank,
408.536	and its branches were touching the water,
411.307	and it was shadowy.
412.904	And if had been a horror movie,
415.362	people in the audience would have started saying,
417.598	"""Don't go in there. Don't go in there."" (Laughter)"
421.051	And of course, the crocodile was in the shadows.
424.808	Now the first thing that you notice
424.808	when a crocodile hits you
426.923	is the ferocity of the bite.
428.523	Wham! It hits me by my right leg.
430.496	It pulls me. It turns. I throw my hand up.
430.496	I'm able to grab a branch.
434.399	It's shaking me violently.
436.137	It's a very strange sensation
437.851	having another creature try and eat you,
439.797	and there are few things that
439.797	promote vegetarianism like that.
443.248	(Laughter)
444.843	Solly on the bank sees that I'm in trouble.
447.128	He turns. He begins to make his way to me.
449.175	The croc again continues to shake me.
451.126	It goes to bite me a second time.
453.043	I notice a slick of blood in the water around me
455.232	that gets washed downstream.
456.836	As it bites the second time, I kick.
459.009	My foot goes down its throat. It spits me out.
461.742	I pull myself up into the branches,
463.873	and as I come out of the water,
463.873	I look over my shoulder.
467.356	My leg from the knee down
469.276	is mangled beyond description.
471.204	The bone is cracked.
472.599	The meat is torn up.
474.429	I make an instant decision that
474.429	I'll never look at that again.
479.029	As I come out of the water,
481.413	Solly arrives at a deep section,
484.03	a channel between us.
485.655	He knows, he sees the state of my leg,
487.793	he knows that between him and I
489.639	there is a crocodile,
490.851	and I can tell you this man doesn't
490.851	slow down for one second.
493.343	He comes straight into the channel.
495.149	He wades in to above his waist.
497.084	He gets to me. He grabs me.
498.547	I'm still in a vulnerable position.
500.219	He picks me and puts me on his shoulder.
501.944	This is the other thing about Solly,
501.944	he's freakishly strong.
504.363	He turns. He walks me up the bank.
506.826	He lays me down. He pulls his shirt off.
508.88	He wraps it around my leg,
510.664	picks me up a second time,
511.955	walks me to a vehicle,
513.861	and he's able to get me to medical attention.
517.285	And I survive.
520.508	Now — (Applause)
524.769	Now I don't know how many people you know
527.479	that go into a deep channel of water
529.695	that they know has a crocodile in it
531.955	to come and help you,
533.298	but for Solly, it was as natural as breathing.
536.742	And he is one amazing example
539.198	of what I have experienced all over Africa.
542.643	In a more collective society,
544.774	we realize from the inside
547.622	that our own well-being is deeply tied
550.755	to the well-being of others.
553.993	Danger is shared. Pain is shared.
557.262	Joy is shared. Achievement is shared.
560.187	Houses are shared. Food is shared.
564.717	Ubuntu asks us to open our hearts
567.913	and to share,
569.327	and what Solly taught me that day
571.279	is the essence of this value,
573.282	his animated, empathetic action
576.04	in every moment.
578.085	Now although the root word is about people,
581.592	I thought that maybe ubuntu was only about people.
584.966	And then I met this young lady.
588.24	Her name was Elvis.
589.934	In fact, Solly gave her the name Elvis
591.705	because he said she walked like she was doing
594.562	the Elvis the pelvis dance.
597.227	She was born with very badly
597.227	deformed back legs and pelvis.
601.593	She arrived at our reserve from a reserve
603.857	east of us on her migratory route.
605.913	When I first saw her,
607.692	I thought she would be dead in a matter of days.
610.16	And yet, for the next five years
613.088	she returned in the winter months.
615.618	And we would be so excited to be out in the bush
617.995	and to come across this unusual track.
620.391	It looked like an inverted bracket,
621.886	and we would drop whatever
621.886	we were doing and we would follow,
624.335	and then we would come around the corner,
626.006	and there she would be with her herd.
628.092	And that outpouring of emotion
630.987	from people on our safari trucks
632.701	as they saw her, it was this sense of kinship.
635.943	And it reminded me
637.428	that even people who grow up in cities
639.359	feel a natural connection
642.944	with the natural world and with animals.
645.215	And yet still I remained amazed
645.215	that she was surviving.
648.799	And then one day we came across
648.799	them at this small water hole.
651.76	It was sort of a hollow in the ground.
653.612	And I watched as the matriarch drank,
656.066	and then she turned in that 
656.066	beautiful slow motion of elephants,
659.341	looks like the arm in motion,
661.11	and she began to make her way up the steep bank.
664.116	The rest of the herd turned and began to follow.
668.76	And I watched young Elvis
670.544	begin to psych herself up for the hill.
673.9	She got visibly -- ears came forward,
677.255	she had a full go of it and halfway up,
679.404	her legs gave way, and she fell backwards.
681.681	She attempted it a second time,
683.5	and again, halfway up, she fell backwards.
686.675	And on the third attempt,
688.532	an amazing thing happened.
690.989	Halfway up the bank,
692.726	a young teenage elephant came in behind her,
695.799	and he propped his trunk underneath her,
698.002	and he began to shovel her up the bank.
701.339	And it occurred to me
702.727	that the rest of the herd
704.283	was in fact looking after this young elephant.
706.958	The next day I watched again
709.482	as the matriarch broke a branch
711.652	and she would put it in her mouth,
713.493	and then she would break a second one
715.45	and drop it on the ground.
718.157	And a consensus developed between all of us
720.529	who were guiding people in that area
722.378	that that herd was in fact moving slower
725.527	to accommodate that elephant.
729.583	What Elvis and the herd taught me
731.674	caused me to expand my definition of ubuntu,
734.998	and I believe that in the cathedral of the wild,
737.614	we get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves
739.825	reflected back at us.
741.582	And it is not only through other people
745.222	that we get to experience our humanity
748.142	but through all the creatures that live on this planet.
752.068	If Africa has a gift to share,
754.882	it's a gift of a more collective society.
758.709	And while it's true that ubuntu is an African idea,
762.957	what I see is the essence of that value
767.368	being invented here.
769.73	Thank you.
771.845	(Applause)
796.082	Pat Mitchell: So Boyd,
797.879	we know that you knew President Mandela
802.92	from early childhood
804.897	and that you heard the news as we all did today,
807.796	and deeply distraught
810.236	and know the tragic loss that it is to the world.
814.667	But I just wondered if you wanted
816.749	to share any additional thoughts,
818.655	because we know that you heard that news
820.729	just before coming in to do this session.
824.109	Boyd Varty: Well thanks, Pat.
825.805	I'm so happy because it was time for him to pass on.
828.988	He was suffering.
830.759	And so of course there's the mixed emotions.
833.157	But I just think of so many occurrences
835.141	like the time he went on the Oprah show
837.548	and asked her what the show would be about.
840.404	(Laughter)
841.882	"And she was like, ""Well, it'll be about you."""
845.18	I mean, that's just incredible humility.
847.928	(Laughter)
851.591	He was the father of our nation
854.753	and we've got a road to walk in South Africa.
861.201	And everything, they used to call it Madiba magic.
864.611	You know, he used to go to
864.611	a rugby match and we would win.
867.394	Anywhere he went, things went well.
870.855	But I think that magic will be with us,
873.236	and the important thing is that we carry
876.797	what he stood for.
878.322	And so that's what I'm going to try and do,
881.809	and that's what people all over 
881.809	South Africa are trying to do.
884.701	PM: And that's what you've done today.
884.701	BV: Oh, thank you.
886.927	PM: Thank you.
886.927	BV: Thank you. Thanks very much.
890.066	(Applause)
