27.644	(Breathes out)
33.274	So, I didn't always make
33.274	my living from music.
37.123	For about the five years after graduating
39.147	from an upstanding
39.147	liberal arts university,
42.276	this was my day job.
45.131	(Laughter)
46.363	I was a self-employed living
46.363	statue called the Eight-Foot Bride,
50.931	and I love telling people
50.931	I did this for a job,
54.671	because everybody always wants to know,
56.656	who are these freaks in real life.
58.635	(Laughter)
59.66	Hello.
61.152	I painted myself white
61.152	one day, stood on a box,
64.331	put a hat or a can at my feet,
66.739	and when someone came by
66.739	and dropped in money,
69.09	I handed them a flower --
73.171	and some intense eye contact.
77.247	And if they didn't take the flower,
78.971	I threw in a gesture
78.971	of sadness and longing --
83.017	as they walked away.
87.201	(Laughter)
90.905	So I had the most profound
90.905	encounters with people,
94.895	especially lonely people
96.23	who looked like they hadn't talked
96.23	to anyone in weeks,
99.579	and we would get this beautiful moment
99.579	of prolonged eye contact
105.572	being allowed in a city street,
107.889	and we would sort of fall
107.889	in love a little bit.
111.201	And my eyes would say --
113.693	"""Thank you."
115.288	"I see you."""
117.185	And their eyes would say --
120.589	"""Nobody ever sees me."
123.161	"Thank you."""
126.168	I would get harassed sometimes.
127.677	People would yell at me from their cars.
129.765	"""Get a job!"""
131.407	(Laughing) And I'd be, like,
133.471	"""This is my job."""
135.301	But it hurt, because it made me fear
139.034	that I was somehow doing
139.034	something un-joblike
143.292	and unfair, shameful.
146.406	I had no idea how perfect
146.406	a real education I was getting
151.279	for the music business on this box.
154.015	And for the economists out there,
155.611	you may be interested to know I actually
155.611	made a pretty predictable income,
159.216	which was shocking to me,
159.216	given I had no regular customers,
163.431	but pretty much 60 bucks on a Tuesday,
166.719	It was consistent.
168.004	And meanwhile, I was touring locally
168.004	and playing in nightclubs
171.488	with my band, the Dresden Dolls.
173.35	This was me on piano, a genius drummer.
175.448	I wrote the songs, and eventually
177.361	we started making enough money
177.361	that I could quit being a statue,
181.747	and as we started touring,
184.008	I really didn't want to lose this sense
186.382	of direct connection with people,
186.382	because I loved it.
189.082	So after all of our shows,
189.082	we would sign autographs
193.037	and hug fans and hang out
193.037	and talk to people,
195.949	and we made an art out
195.949	of asking people to help us and join us,
201.641	and I would track down
201.641	local musicians and artists
204.787	and they would set up
204.787	outside of our shows,
207.979	and they would pass the hat,
209.467	and then they would come in
209.467	and join us onstage,
211.967	so we had this rotating smorgasbord
211.967	of weird, random circus guests.
215.975	And then Twitter came along,
218.48	and made things even more magic,
220.536	because I could ask instantly
220.536	for anything anywhere.
223.295	So I would need a piano to practice on,
225.36	and an hour later I would be
225.36	at a fan's house.
227.653	This is in London.
229.094	People would bring home-cooked food to us
231.198	all over the world backstage
231.198	and feed us and eat with us.
233.937	This is in Seattle.
235.343	Fans who worked in museums and stores
238.97	and any kind of public space
238.97	would wave their hands
242.177	if I would decide to do
242.177	a last-minute, spontaneous, free gig.
245.441	This is a library in Auckland.
248.864	On Saturday I tweeted
248.864	for this crate and hat,
253.341	because I did not want to schlep them
253.341	from the East Coast,
256.124	and they showed up care of this dude,
256.124	Chris, from Newport Beach,
259.171	who says hello.
260.904	"I once tweeted, ""Where in Melbourne"
260.904	"can I buy a neti pot?"""
264.61	And a nurse from a hospital drove one
267.14	right at that moment to the cafe I was in,
269.411	and I bought her a smoothie
270.879	and we sat there talking
270.879	about nursing and death.
273.443	And I love this kind of random closeness,
276.498	which is lucky, because I do
276.498	a lot of couchsurfing.
281.188	In mansions where everyone
281.188	in my crew gets their own room
284.302	but there's no wireless,
285.579	and in punk squats,
287.135	everyone on the floor
287.135	in one room with no toilets
290.097	but with wireless,
290.097	clearly making it the better option.
293.914	(Laughter)
296.259	My crew once pulled our van
296.259	up to a really poor Miami neighborhood
302.349	and we found out that our couchsurfing
302.349	host for the night
305.055	was an 18-year-old girl,
305.055	still living at home,
307.642	and her family were all undocumented
307.642	immigrants from Honduras.
312.266	And that night, her whole family
315.666	took the couches and she slept
315.666	together with her mom
318.743	so that we could take their beds.
321.298	And I lay there thinking,
324.139	these people have so little.
326.933	Is this fair?
329.033	And in the morning,
330.37	her mom taught us
330.37	how to try to make tortillas
332.717	and wanted to give me a Bible,
334.718	and she took me aside and she said
334.718	to me in her broken English,
340.311	"""Your music has helped"
340.311	my daughter so much.
345.844	Thank you for staying here.
345.844	"We're all so grateful."""
349.154	And I thought, this is fair.
353.438	This is this.
356.565	A couple of months later,
356.565	I was in Manhattan,
359.509	and I tweeted for a crash pad,
359.509	and at midnight,
361.797	I'm on the Lower East Side,
363.599	and it occurs to me I've never
363.599	actually done this alone.
366.392	I've always been with my band or my crew.
368.369	Is this what stupid people do?
370.674	(Laughter)
372.205	Is this how stupid people die?
374.604	And before I can change my mind,
374.604	the door busts open.
377.153	She's an artist.
378.208	He's a financial blogger for Reuters,
380.552	and they're pouring me a glass of red wine
382.59	and offering me a bath,
383.761	and I have had thousands of nights
383.761	like that and like that.
389.07	So I couchsurf a lot.
389.07	I also crowdsurf a lot.
393.108	I maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing
396.069	are basically the same thing.
398.317	You're falling into the audience
400.822	and you're trusting each other.
402.689	I once asked an opening band of mine
404.977	if they wanted to go out
404.977	into the crowd and pass the hat
407.668	to get some extra money,
407.668	something that I did a lot.
410.382	And as usual, the band was psyched,
412.194	but there was this one guy in the band
414.392	who told me he just couldn't
414.392	bring himself to go out there.
418.274	It felt too much like begging
418.274	to stand there with the hat.
422.468	And I recognized his fear
426.112	"of ""Is this fair?"""
428.225	"and ""Get a job."""
431.016	And meanwhile, my band
431.016	is becoming bigger and bigger.
434.116	We sign with a major label.
436.271	And our music is a cross
436.271	between punk and cabaret.
439.209	It's not for everybody.
440.615	Well, maybe it's for you.
443.066	(Laughter)
445.174	We sign, and there's all this hype
445.174	leading up to our next record.
448.994	And it comes out and it sells
448.994	about 25,000 copies
452.687	in the first few weeks,
454	and the label considers this a failure.
457.968	"I was like, ""25,000, isn't that a lot?"""
459.881	"They said, ""No, the sales are going down."
461.873	"It's a failure."""
462.913	And they walk off.
464.838	Right at this same time,
464.838	I'm signing and hugging after a gig,
468.222	and a guy comes up to me
470.013	and hands me a $10 bill,
472.215	and he says,
473.896	"""I'm sorry, I burned"
473.896	"your CD from a friend."""
476.738	(Laughter)
481.579	"""But I read your blog,"
481.579	I know you hate your label.
484.111	"I just want you to have this money."""
486.991	And this starts happening all the time.
490.485	I become the hat after my own gigs,
493.95	but I have to physically stand there
493.95	and take the help from people,
497.236	and unlike the guy in the opening band,
499.445	I've actually had a lot
499.445	of practice standing there.
504.033	Thank you.
505.591	And this is the moment I decide
507.742	I'm just going to give away
507.742	my music for free
510.634	online whenever possible,
512.366	so it's like Metallica
512.366	over here, Napster, bad;
515.852	Amanda Palmer over here,
517.542	and I'm going to encourage
517.542	torrenting, downloading, sharing,
520.841	but I'm going to ask for help,
522.963	because I saw it work on the street.
526.259	So I fought my way off my label,
526.259	and for my next project
529.187	with my new band,
529.187	the Grand Theft Orchestra,
531.891	I turned to crowdfunding.
534.619	And I fell into those thousands
534.619	of connections that I'd made,
538.787	and I asked my crowd to catch me.
542.052	And the goal was 100,000 dollars.
544.918	My fans backed me at nearly 1.2 million,
548.457	which was the biggest music
548.457	crowdfunding project to date.
551.363	(Applause)
555.451	And you can see how many people it is.
560.118	It's about 25,000 people.
563.499	And the media asked,
564.993	"""Amanda, the music business is tanking"
564.993	and you encourage piracy.
568.471	How did you make
568.471	"all these people pay for music?"""
570.829	And the real answer is,
570.829	I didn't make them.
573.658	I asked them.
575.518	And through the very act of asking people,
579.38	I'd connected with them,
581.096	and when you connect with them,
581.096	people want to help you.
586.255	It's kind of counterintuitive
586.255	for a lot of artists.
590.025	They don't want to ask for things.
591.715	But it's not easy.
595.392	It's not easy to ask.
597.376	And a lot of artists have
597.376	a problem with this.
599.582	Asking makes you vulnerable.
601.873	And I got a lot of criticism online,
606.421	after my Kickstarter went big,
608.042	for continuing my crazy
608.042	crowdsourcing practices,
611.001	specifically for asking musicians
613.882	who are fans if they wanted
613.882	to join us on stage
616.255	for a few songs in exchange
616.255	for love and tickets and beer,
620.57	and this was a doctored image
620.57	that went up of me on a website.
625.602	And this hurt in a really familiar way.
629.216	And people saying,
630.942	"""You're not allowed anymore"
630.942	"to ask for that kind of help,"""
633.995	really reminded me of the people
633.995	"in their cars yelling, ""Get a job."""
639.109	Because they weren't
639.109	with us on the sidewalk,
643.236	and they couldn't see the exchange
646.493	that was happening
646.493	between me and my crowd,
648.565	an exchange that was very fair
648.565	to us but alien to them.
654.208	So this is slightly not safe for work.
656.255	This is my Kickstarter
656.255	backer party in Berlin.
658.842	At the end of the night, I stripped
658.842	and let everyone draw on me.
661.899	Now let me tell you,
661.899	if you want to experience
664.916	the visceral feeling
664.916	of trusting strangers --
667.411	(Laughter)
668.882	I recommend this,
670.097	especially if those strangers
670.097	are drunk German people.
673.464	(Laughter)
675.399	This was a ninja
675.399	master-level fan connection,
679.243	because what I was really saying here was,
681.763	I trust you this much.
684.355	Should I?
686.244	Show me.
688.483	For most of human history,
690.519	musicians, artists, they've been
690.519	part of the community.
695.877	Connectors and openers,
695.877	not untouchable stars.
700.094	Celebrity is about a lot of people
700.094	loving you from a distance,
704.436	but the Internet
705.605	and the content that we're freely
705.605	able to share on it
709.23	are taking us back.
712.004	It's about a few people
712.004	loving you up close
715.712	and about those people being enough.
720.263	So a lot of people
720.263	are confused by the idea
722.414	of no hard sticker price.
723.729	They see it as an unpredictable risk,
723.729	but the things I've done,
726.951	the Kickstarter, the street, the doorbell,
729.363	I don't see these things as risk.
731.217	I see them as trust.
733.335	Now, the online tools
735.353	to make the exchange as easy
735.353	and as instinctive as the street,
740.125	they're getting there.
741.863	But the perfect tools
741.863	aren't going to help us
745.462	if we can't face each other
747.93	and give and receive fearlessly,
750.989	but, more important --
753.891	to ask without shame.
757.225	My music career has been spent
759.86	trying to encounter people on the Internet
759.86	the way I could on the box.
765.263	So blogging and tweeting
765.263	not just about my tour dates
768.775	and my new video
768.775	but about our work and our art
772.366	and our fears and our hangovers,
775.507	our mistakes,
776.949	and we see each other.
779.2	And I think when we really see each other,
782.818	we want to help each other.
787.023	I think people have been obsessed
787.023	with the wrong question,
790.186	"which is, ""How do we make"
790.186	"people pay for music?"""
794.082	What if we started asking,
796.91	"""How do we let people pay for music?"""
801.792	Thank you.
802.96	(Applause)
