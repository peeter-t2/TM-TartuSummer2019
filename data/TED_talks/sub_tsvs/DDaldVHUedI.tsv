12.706	I love museums.
16.3	Have you guys ever been
16.3	to the Natural History Museum?
18.86	In New York City?
20.3	(Applause)
21.98	So one of the things that I do
21.98	is I take my kids to the museum.
27.7	Recently I took them
27.7	to the Natural History Museum.
30.3	I had my two sons with me,
30.3	Sabian and Dabith.
33.46	And we go into the front
33.46	entrance of the museum,
36.1	and there's that amazing sculpture
36.1	of Teddy Roosevelt out there.
39.756	You guys know which one I'm talking about.
41.78	Teddy Roosevelt is sitting there
41.78	with one hand on the horse,
44.9	bold, strong, sleeves rolled up.
47.26	I don't know if he's bare-chested,
47.26	but it kind of feels like it.
50.3	(Laughter)
51.66	And on the left-hand side of him
51.66	is a Native American walking.
56.34	And on the right-hand side of him
56.34	is an African-American walking.
61.54	And as we're moving up the stairs,
65.02	getting closer to the sculpture,
67.98	my oldest son, who's nine, says,
70.06	"""Dad, how come he gets to ride,"
74.94	"and they have to walk?"""
78.26	It stopped me in my tracks.
80.34	It stopped me in my tracks.
82.42	There was so much history
83.9	that we would have to go through
83.9	to try to explain that,
86.58	and that's something
86.58	I try to do with them anyways.
90.26	It's a question that I probably
90.26	would have never really asked.
94.54	But fundamentally what he was saying was,
96.74	"""That doesn't look fair."
98.54	Dad, that doesn't look fair.
100.86	And why is this thing that's so not fair
103.46	sitting outside
103.46	"of such an amazing institution."""
107.46	And his question got me wondering,
109.14	is there a way for us
109.14	to amend our public sculptures,
114.02	our national monuments?
116.14	Not erase them,
118.14	but is there a way to amend them?
120.42	Now, I didn't grow up going to museums.
124.9	That's not my history.
127.26	My mother was 15 years old
127.26	when I was born.
129.46	She is amazing.
131.94	My father was struggling
131.94	with his own things
134.3	for most of my life.
137.66	If you really want to know the truth,
139.7	the only reason I got into art
139.7	is because of a woman.
143.78	There was this amazing, amazing,
143.78	fantastic, beautiful, smart woman,
148.66	four years older than me,
150.02	and I wanted to go out with her.
151.86	"But she said, ""You're too young"
153.38	and you're not thinking
153.38	"about your future."""
155.62	So I ran on down to the junior college,
159.3	registered for some classes,
161.5	ran on back,
163.18	and basically was like,
163.18	"""I'm thinking about my future now."""
166.02	(Laughter)
168.46	"""Can we go out?"""
170.9	For the record, she's even more amazing.
173.34	I married her.
174.58	(Applause)
180.18	So when I randomly ran down
180.18	to the junior college
184.86	and registered for classes,
186.26	I really wasn't paying attention
186.26	to what I was registering to.
189.98	(Laughter)
191.26	So I ended up with an art history class,
194.02	and I didn't know a thing
194.02	about art history.
197.26	But something amazing happened
197.26	when I went into that class.
201.5	For the first time in my academic career,
205.34	my visual intelligence was required of me.
208.74	For the first time.
210.38	The professor would put up an image,
212.46	bold strokes of blues and yellows,
212.46	"and say, ""Who's that?"""
216.62	"And I'd go, ""That's Van Gogh."
216.62	Clearly that is Van Gogh.
219.54	"I got this."""
221.14	(Laughter)
223.1	I got a B in that class.
226.06	For me, that was amazing.
230.18	In high school, let's just say
230.18	I wasn't a great student. OK?
234.5	In high school, my GPA was .65.
236.94	(Laughter)
238.46	Decimal point first, six five.
242.78	So me getting a B was huge, huge,
246.94	absolutely huge.
248.7	And because of the fact that I realized
248.7	that I was able to learn things visually
253.66	that I couldn't learn in other ways,
255.42	this became my strategy,
255.42	this became my tactic
258.3	for understanding everything else.
261.58	I wanted to stay in this relationship.
261.58	Things were going well.
264.54	I decided, let me keep taking
264.54	these art history classes.
267.22	One of the last art history classes,
267.22	I will not forget, I will never forget.
270.82	It was one of those survey
270.82	art history classes.
273.06	Anybody ever have one of those
273.06	survey art history classes,
275.82	where they try to teach you
275.82	the entire history of art
278.78	in a single semester?
280.26	I'm talking about cave paintings
280.26	and Jackson Pollock
285.3	just crunched together all in the same --
287.58	It doesn't really work,
287.58	but they try anyway.
291.5	Well, at the beginning of the semester,
294.02	I looked at the book,
295.26	and in this 400-page book
295.26	was about a 14-page section
299.22	that was on black people in painting.
301.34	Now, this was a crammed in section
303.38	that had representations
303.38	of black people in painting
307.78	and black people who painted.
310.54	It was poorly curated,
310.54	let's just put it that way.
314.86	(Laughter)
316.1	Nonetheless I was really excited about it,
319.46	because in all
319.46	the other classes that I had,
321.78	we didn't even have that conversation.
324.94	We didn't talk about it at all.
327.54	So imagine my surprise
329.3	when I get to class
330.9	and on the day that we're supposed
330.9	to go over that particular chapter,
335.14	my professor announces,
337.98	"""We're going to skip this chapter today"
339.9	because we do not have time
339.9	"to go through it."""
342.66	"""Whoa, I'm sorry,"
342.66	hold on, professor, professor.
345.54	I'm sorry. This is a really
345.54	important chapter to me.
349.14	"Are we going to go over it at any point?"""
351.42	"""Titus, we don't have time for this."""
353.26	"""I'm sorry, I'm sorry,"
353.26	I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
355.38	please, I really need to understand.
357.14	Clearly the author thinks
357.14	that this is significant.
359.58	"Why are we skipping over this?"""
361.14	"""Titus, I do not have time for this."""
363.18	"""OK, last question, I'm really sorry here."
365.46	When can we talk,
365.46	"because we need to talk."""
367.54	(Laughter)
369.38	I went to her office hours.
371.62	I ended up getting kicked
371.62	out of her office.
374.18	I went to the dean.
375.7	The dean finally told me,
375.7	"""I can't force her to teach anything."""
378.78	And I knew in that moment
378.78	if I wanted to understand this history,
382.86	if I wanted to understand the roles
382.86	of those folks who had to walk,
387.3	I was probably going
387.3	to have to figure that out myself.
393.42	So ...
399.78	above you right here on the slide
403.14	is a painting by Frans Hals.
407.02	This is one of the kinds of images
411.78	that was in that chapter.
415.14	I taught myself how to paint
417.26	by going to museums
417.26	and looking at images like this.
423.46	I want to show you something.
437.94	I made this.
440.14	I --
441.38	(Applause)
442.82	I made some alterations.
444.1	You'll see there are
444.1	some slight differences in the painting.
448.66	All this art history
448.66	that I had been absorbing
453.38	helped me to realize
453.38	that painting is a language.
461.1	There is a reason
467.66	why he is the highest
467.66	in the composition here.
477.62	There is a reason
481.38	why the painter is showing us
481.38	this gold necklace here.
488.46	He's trying to tell us something
488.46	about the economic status
491.22	of these people in these paintings.
496.14	Painting is a visual language
500.1	where everything in the painting
503.62	is meaningful, is important.
506.34	It's coded.
512.42	But sometimes, because
512.42	of the compositional structure,
515.54	because of compositional hierarchy,
518.26	it's hard to see other things.
536.14	This silk is supposed to tell us also
536.14	that they have quite a bit of money.
542.66	There's more written
544.34	about dogs in art history
548.34	than there are about
548.34	this other character here.
553.02	Historically speaking,
553.02	in research on these kinds of paintings,
556.14	I can find out more about the lace
560.14	that the woman is wearing
560.14	in this painting --
563.14	the manufacturer of the lace --
563.14	than I can about this character here,
567.9	about his dreams, about his hopes,
570.06	about what he wanted out of life.
575.1	I want to show you something.
579.02	I don't want you to think
580.9	that this is about eradication.
584.86	It's not.
586.1	The oil that you saw me
586.1	just put inside of this paint
590.26	is linseed oil.
591.78	It becomes transparent over time,
594.62	so eventually what's going to happen
597.7	is these faces
600.14	will emerge a little bit.
604.22	What I'm trying to do,
606.14	what I'm trying to show you,
608.22	is how to shift your gaze just slightly,
611.62	just momentarily,
613.54	just momentarily,
614.98	to ask yourself the question,
618.18	why do some have to walk?
620.18	What is the impact of these kinds
620.18	of sculptures at museums?
624.46	What is the impact
624.46	of these kinds of paintings
628.06	on some of our most vulnerable in society,
630.98	seeing these kinds of depictions
630.98	of themselves all the time?
634.98	I'm not saying erase it.
636.82	We can't erase this history.
639.02	It's real. We have to know it.
641.7	I think of it in the same way
643.66	we think of --
647.58	Let me step back a second.
649.7	You remember old-school cameras,
652.06	where when you took a picture,
652.06	you actually had to focus. Right?
655.38	You'd put the camera up,
656.66	and if I wanted you in focus,
658.66	I would move the lens a little to the left
660.684	and you would come forward.
662.02	I could move the lens
662.02	a little to the right,
664.14	and you would go back and the folks
664.14	in the background would come out.
667.42	I'm just trying to do that here.
669.46	I'm trying to give you that opportunity.
673.06	I'm trying to answer that question
675.3	that my son had.
679.9	I want to make paintings,
681.9	I want to make sculptures
684.18	that are honest,
686.42	that wrestle with
686.42	the struggles of our past
691.22	but speak to the diversity
691.22	and the advances of our present.
696.7	And we can't do that by taking an eraser
696.7	and getting rid of stuff.
699.9	That's just not going to work.
701.66	I think that we should
701.66	do it in the same way
703.78	the American Constitution works.
705.38	When we have a situation
706.66	where we want to change
706.66	a law in the American Constitution,
710.54	we don't erase the other one.
713.34	Alongside that is an amendment,
715.58	something that says,
716.86	"""This is where we were,"
716.86	"but this is where we are right now."""
721.26	I figure if we can do that,
723.74	then that will help us
723.74	understand a little bit
726.1	about where we're going.
758.3	Thank you.
759.54	(Applause)
