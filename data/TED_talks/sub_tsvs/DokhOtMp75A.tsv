12.825	A few years ago,
14.747	my mom developed rheumatoid arthritis.
18.989	Her wrists, knees and toes swelled up,
18.989	causing crippling, chronic pain.
26.391	She had to file for disability.
28.734	She stopped attending our local mosque.
31.516	Some mornings it was too painful
31.516	for her to brush her teeth.
36.339	I wanted to help.
38.5	But I didn't know how.
40.716	I'm not a doctor.
43.005	So, what I am is a historian of medicine.
47.93	So I started to research
47.93	the history of chronic pain.
51.957	Turns out, UCLA has an entire
51.957	history of pain collection
56.002	in their archives.
58.593	And I found a story --
58.593	a fantastic story --
62.069	of a man who saved -- rescued --
62.069	millions of people from pain;
67.889	people like my mom.
70.772	Yet, I had never heard of him.
72.256	There were no biographies
72.256	of him, no Hollywood movies.
76.483	His name was John J. Bonica.
81.07	But when our story begins,
82.642	he was better known as
82.642	"Johnny ""Bull"" Walker."
88.611	It was a summer day in 1941.
91.857	The circus had just arrived
91.857	in the tiny town of Brookfield, New York.
97.486	Spectators flocked to see
97.486	the wire-walkers, the tramp clowns --
101.431	if they were lucky, the human cannonball.
104.19	They also came to see the strongman,
104.19	"Johnny ""Bull"" Walker,"
108.098	a brawny bully who'd pin you for a dollar.
112.467	You know, on that particular day,
112.467	a voice rang out
115.432	over the circus P.A. system.
117.441	They needed a doctor urgently,
117.441	in the live animal tent.
121.302	Something had gone wrong
121.302	with the lion tamer.
123.71	The climax of his act had gone wrong,
126.863	and his head was stuck
126.863	inside the lion's mouth.
131.629	He was running out of air;
133.312	the crowd watched in horror
135.503	as he struggled and then passed out.
138.788	When the lion finally did relax its jaws,
142.073	the lion tamer just slumped
142.073	to the ground, motionless.
147.813	When he came to a few minutes later,
150.206	he saw a familiar figure hunched over him.
153.169	It was Bull Walker.
155.816	The strongman had given the lion tamer
155.816	mouth-to-mouth, and saved his life.
162.864	Now, the strongman hadn't told anyone,
164.716	but he was actually
164.716	a third-year medical student.
168.788	He toured with the circus
168.788	during summers to pay tuition,
172.474	but kept it a secret
172.474	to protect his persona.
175.787	He was supposed to be
175.787	a brute, a villain --
179.215	not a nerdy do-gooder.
182.535	His medical colleagues didn't
182.535	know his secret, either.
185.156	"As he put it, ""If you were"
185.156	"an athlete, you were a dumb dodo."""
189.849	So he didn't tell them about the circus,
192.344	or about how he wrestled professionally
192.344	on evenings and weekends.
198.353	He used a pseudonym like Bull Walker,
200.997	or later, the Masked Marvel.
203.627	He even kept it a secret that same year,
207.159	when he was crowned
207.159	the Light Heavyweight Champion
210.542	of the world.
213.313	Over the years, John J. Bonica
213.313	lived these parallel lives.
218.515	He was a wrestler;
220.233	he was a doctor.
221.788	He was a heel;
223.334	he was a hero.
225.038	He inflicted pain,
226.858	and he treated it.
229.242	And he didnâ€™t know it at the time,
229.242	but over the next five decades,
232.768	he'd draw on these dueling identities
235.61	to forge a whole new way
235.61	to think about pain.
239.62	It'd change modern medicine
239.62	so much so, that decades later,
243.774	Time magazine would call him
243.774	pain relief's founding father.
249.351	But that all happened later.
252.179	In 1942, Bonica graduated
252.179	medical school and married Emma,
257.815	his sweetheart, whom he had met
257.815	at one of his matches years before.
262.505	He still wrestled in secret -- he had to.
265.781	His internship at New York's
265.781	St. Vincent's Hospital paid nothing.
271.101	With his championship belt,
271.101	he wrestled in big-ticket venues,
274.877	like Madison Square Garden,
276.838	against big-time opponents,
278.538	"like Everett ""The Blonde Bear"" Marshall,"
281.411	or three-time world champion,
281.411	Angelo Savoldi.
286.192	The matches took a toll on his body;
288.993	he tore hip joints, fractured ribs.
292.295	One night, The Terrible Turk's big toe
292.295	scratched a scar like Capone's
297.217	down the side of his face.
299.302	The next morning at work,
299.302	he had to wear a surgical mask to hide it.
304.45	Twice Bonica showed up to the O.R.
304.45	with one eye so bruised,
309.088	he couldn't see out of it.
311.138	But worst of all were
311.138	his mangled cauliflower ears.
316.094	He said they felt like two baseballs
316.094	on the sides of his head.
321.153	Pain just kept accumulating in his life.
325.177	Next, he watched his wife go
325.177	into labor at his hospital.
329.509	She heaved and pushed, clearly in anguish.
333.657	Her obstetrician called
333.657	out to the intern on duty
336.125	to give her a few drops of ether
336.125	to ease her pain.
339.519	But the intern was a young guy,
339.519	just three weeks on the job --
342.904	he was jittery, and in applying the ether,
345.864	irritated Emma's throat.
348.145	She vomited and choked,
348.145	and started to turn blue.
352.895	Bonica, who was watching all this,
352.895	pushed the intern out of the way,
358.259	cleared her airway,
359.864	and saved his wife
359.864	and his unborn daughter.
364.172	At that moment, he decided
364.172	to devote his life to anesthesiology.
369.414	Later, he'd even go on to help develop
369.414	the epidural, for delivering mothers.
374.85	But before he could focus on obstetrics,
377.009	Bonica had to report for basic training.
382.373	Right around D-Day,
383.991	Bonica showed up
383.991	to Madigan Army Medical Center,
387.237	near Tacoma.
388.783	At 7,700 beds, it was one of the largest
388.783	army hospitals in America.
394.242	Bonica was in charge
394.242	of all pain control there.
397.618	He was only 27.
400.47	Treating so many patients,
400.47	Bonica started noticing cases
403.788	that contradicted everything
403.788	he had learned.
406.976	Pain was supposed to be
406.976	a kind of alarm bell -- in a good way --
411.846	a body's way of signaling an injury,
411.846	like a broken arm.
416.538	But in some cases,
418.174	like after a patient had a leg amputated,
421.673	that patient might still complain
421.673	of pain in that nonexistent leg.
426.231	But if the injury had been treated, why
426.231	would the alarm bell keep ringing?
430.861	There were other cases in which there
430.861	was no evidence of an injury whatsoever,
435.014	and yet, still the patient hurt.
438.678	Bonica tracked down all the specialists
438.678	at his hospital -- surgeons,
442.67	neurologists, psychiatrists, others.
445.782	And he tried to get
445.782	their opinions on his patients.
449.643	It took too long, so he started organizing
449.643	group meetings over lunch.
455.123	It would be like a tag team of specialists
455.123	going up against the patient's pain.
459.613	No one had ever focused on pain
459.613	this way before.
464.928	After that, he hit the books.
467.845	He read every medical textbook
467.845	he could get his hands on,
470.732	carefully noting every mention
470.732	"of the word ""pain."""
474.282	Out of the 14,000 pages he read,
478.187	"the word ""pain"" was"
478.187	on 17 and a half of them.
482.908	Seventeen and a half.
484.934	For the most basic, most common,
484.934	most frustrating part of being a patient.
490.875	Bonica was shocked -- I'm quoting him,
493.006	"he said, ""What the hell kind of conclusion"
493.006	can you come to there?
497.484	The most important thing
497.484	from the patient's perspective,
500.69	"they don't talk about."""
503.295	So over the next eight years,
503.295	Bonica would talk about it.
507.209	He'd write about it; he'd write
507.209	those missing pages.
510.057	He wrote what would later be known
510.057	as the Bible of Pain.
514.575	In it he proposed new strategies,
518.016	new treatments using
518.016	nerve-block injections.
521.614	He proposed a new institution,
521.614	the Pain Clinic,
524.381	based on those lunchtime meetings.
527.248	But the most important thing
527.248	about his book
529.683	was that it was kind of an emotional
529.683	alarm bell for medicine.
534.486	A desperate plea to doctors
534.486	to take pain seriously
540.491	in patients' lives.
543.321	He recast the very purpose of medicine.
547.373	The goal wasn't to make patients better;
551.582	it was to make patients feel better.
556.955	He pushed his pain agenda for decades,
559.066	before it finally took hold
559.066	in the mid-'70s.
562.831	Hundreds of pain clinics sprung up
562.831	all over the world.
567.711	But as they did -- a tragic twist.
571.754	Bonica's years of wrestling
571.754	caught up to him.
576.597	He had been out of the ring
576.597	for over 20 years,
578.773	but those 1,500 professional bouts
578.773	had left a mark on his body.
583.769	Still in his mid-50s, he suffered
583.769	severe osteoarthritis.
588.36	Over the next 20 years
588.36	he'd have 22 surgeries,
592.403	including four spine operations,
594.954	and hip replacement after hip replacement.
598.11	He could barely raise
598.11	his arm, turn his neck.
602.144	He needed aluminum crutches to walk.
605.879	His friends and former students
605.879	became his doctors.
609.923	One recalled that he probably
609.923	had more nerve-block injections
614.149	than anyone else on the planet.
618.043	Already a workaholic,
618.043	he worked even more --
623.922	Healing others became more
623.922	than just his job,
626.455	it was his own most effective
626.455	form of relief.
630.51	"""If I wasn't as busy as I am,"""
630.51	he told a reporter at the time,
634.345	"""I would be a completely disabled guy."""
639.423	On a business trip to Florida
639.423	in the early 1980s,
642.986	Bonica got a former student to drive
642.986	him to the Hyde Park area in Tampa.
649.338	They drove past palm trees
649.338	and pulled up to an old mansion,
653.506	with giant silver howitzer cannons
653.506	hidden in the garage.
658.895	The house belonged to the Zacchini family,
661.858	who were something like
661.858	American circus royalty.
666.229	Decades earlier, Bonica had watched them,
668.826	clad in silver jumpsuits and goggles,
671.737	doing the act they pioneered --
671.737	the Human Cannonball.
676.772	But now they were like him: retired.
681.267	That generation is all dead
681.267	now, including Bonica,
684.862	so there's no way to know exactly
684.862	what they said that day.
688.475	But still, I love imagining it.
691.233	The strongman and the human
691.233	cannonballs reunited,
694.51	showing off old scars, and new ones.
697.802	Maybe Bonica gave them medical advice.
700.082	Maybe he told them what he later
700.082	said in an oral history,
705.432	which is that his time in the circus
705.432	and wrestling deeply molded his life.
713.286	Bonica saw pain close up.
717.236	He felt it. He lived it.
720.453	And it made it impossible
720.453	for him to ignore in others.
725.449	Out of that empathy, he spun
725.449	a whole new field,
728.587	played a major role in getting
728.587	medicine to acknowledge pain
731.723	in and of itself.
734.627	In that same oral history,
736.563	Bonica claimed that pain
739.096	is the most complex human experience.
744.215	That it involves your past life,
744.215	your current life,
748.053	your interactions, your family.
751.256	That was definitely true for Bonica.
754.593	But it was also true for my mom.
760.043	It's easy for doctors to see my mom
763.366	as a kind of professional patient,
766.652	a woman who just spends her days
766.652	in waiting rooms.
771.714	Sometimes I get stuck seeing her
771.714	that same way.
777.076	But as I saw Bonica's pain --
779.067	a testament to his fully lived life --
783.623	I started to remember all the things
783.623	that my mom's pain holds.
790.37	Before they got swollen and arthritic,
794.162	my mom's fingers clacked away
797.501	in the hospital H.R. department
797.501	where she worked.
801.15	They folded samosas for our entire mosque.
806.734	When I was a kid, they cut my hair,
810.459	wiped my nose,
812.935	tied my shoes.
821.832	Thank you.
823.181	(Applause)
