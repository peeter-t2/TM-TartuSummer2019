12.866	As a little Hawaiian,
14.095	my mom and auntie always told me
14.095	stories about Kalaupapa --
17.501	the Hawaiian leper colony
18.846	surrounded by the highest
18.846	sea cliffs in the world --
21.697	and Father Damien,
23.133	the Belgian missionary who gave his life
23.133	for the Hawaiian community.
27.102	As a young nurse,
28.489	my aunt trained the nuns
28.489	caring for the remaining lepers
31.454	almost a 100 years after
31.454	Father Damien died of leprosy.
36.501	I remember stories she told
38.196	about traveling down
38.196	switchback cliff paths on a mule,
41.172	while my uncle played
41.172	her favorite hula songs on the ukulele
44.327	all the way down to Kalaupapa.
46.73	You see, as a youngster,
48.255	I was always curious about a few things.
50.681	First was why a Belgian missionary
50.681	chose to live in complete isolation
55.755	in Kalaupapa,
56.969	knowing he would inevitably
56.969	contract leprosy
59.223	from the community of people
59.223	he sought to help.
62.256	And secondly,
64.617	where did the leprosy bacteria come from?
67.002	And why were KƒÅnaka Maoli,
68.781	the indigenous people of Hawaii,
71.054	so susceptible to developing
71.054	"leprosy, or ""mai Pake?"""
75.853	This got my curious about what
75.853	makes us unique as Hawaiians --
79.607	namely, our genetic makeup.
82.964	But it wasn't until high school,
84.932	through the Human Genome Project,
86.568	that I realized I wasn't alone
88.791	in trying to connect
88.791	our unique genetic ancestry
91.643	to our potential health,
91.643	wellness and illness.
96.061	You see,
97.235	the 2.7 billion-dollar project
99.058	promised an era of predictive
99.058	and preventative medicine
103.072	based on our unique genetic makeup.
105.849	So to me it always seemed obvious
107.549	that in order to achieve this dream,
110.301	we would need to sequence
110.301	a diverse cohort of people
114.338	to obtain the full spectrum
114.338	of human genetic variation on the planet.
118.303	That's why 10 years later,
120.899	it continues to shock me,
122.597	knowing that 96 percent of genome studies
125.835	associating common genetic variation
125.835	with specific diseases
129.439	have focused exclusively
129.439	on individuals of European ancestry.
134.069	Now you don't need a PhD
135.502	to see that that leaves four percent
135.502	for the rest of diversity.
139.164	And in my own searching,
141.316	I've discovered that far less
141.316	than one percent
143.849	have actually focused on indigenous
143.849	communities, like myself.
147.481	So that begs the question:
149.552	Who is the Human Genome
149.552	Project actually for?
152.853	Just like we have
152.853	different colored eyes and hair,
155.235	we metabolize drugs differently
156.767	based on the variation in our genomes.
158.978	So how many of you
158.978	would be shocked to learn
162.439	that 95 percent of clinical trials
165.245	have also exclusively featured
165.245	individuals of European ancestry?
170.387	This bias
171.746	and systematic lack of engagement
171.746	of indigenous people
175.611	in both clinical trials
175.611	and genome studies
178.619	is partially the result
178.619	of a history of distrust.
182.893	For example,
184.067	in 1989, researchers
184.067	from Arizona State University
188.02	obtained blood samples
188.02	from Arizona's Havasupai tribe,
191.61	promising to alleviate the burden
191.61	of type 2 diabetes
194.568	that was plaguing their community,
196.452	only to turn around and use
196.452	those exact same samples --
200.361	without the Havasupai's consent --
202.088	to study rates
202.088	of schizophrenia, inbreeding,
205.617	and challenge
205.617	the Havasupai's origin story.
209.319	When the Havasupai found out,
211.885	they sued successfully for $700,000,
215.102	and they banned ASU from conducting
215.102	research on their reservation.
220.961	This culminated in a sort of domino effect
224.239	with local tribes in the Southwest --
226.025	including the Navajo Nation,
227.478	one of the largest
227.478	tribes in the country --
229.589	putting a moratorium on genetic research.
231.86	Now despite this history of distrust,
234.765	I still believe that indigenous people
234.765	can benefit from genetic research.
239.264	And if we don't do something soon,
241.533	the gap in health disparities
241.533	is going to continue to widen.
245.113	Hawaii, for example,
246.542	has the longest life expectancy
246.542	on average of any state in the US,
250.273	yet native Hawaiians like myself
253.154	die a full decade
253.154	before our non-native counterparts,
256.264	because we have some
256.264	of the highest rates of type 2 diabetes,
260.339	obesity,
261.514	and the number one and number
261.514	two killers in the US:
264.063	cardiovascular disease and cancer.
265.926	So how do we ensure
267.669	the populations of people
267.669	that need genome sequencing the most
270.844	are not the last to benefit?
272.671	My vision is to make
272.671	genetic research more native,
277.418	to indigenize genome
277.418	sequencing technology.
280.902	Traditionally, genomes
280.902	are sequenced in laboratories.
284.555	Here's an image of your classic
284.555	genome sequencer.
287.167	It's huge.
288.342	It's the size of a refrigerator.
290.75	There's this obvious physical limitation.
293.321	But what if you could sequence
293.321	genomes on the fly?
297.21	What if you could fit a genome
297.21	sequencer in your pocket?
303.848	This nanopore-based sequencer
306.27	is one 10,000th the size
306.27	of your traditional genome sequencer.
310.779	It doesn't have the same
310.779	physical limitations,
313.024	in that it's not tethered to a lab bench
313.024	with extraneous cords,
317.324	large vats of chemicals
317.324	or computer monitors.
320.456	It allows us to de-black box genome
320.456	sequencing technology development
325.631	in a way that's immersive
325.631	and collaborative,
328.267	activating and empowering
328.267	indigenous communities ...
332.476	as citizen scientists.
337.672	we now have the technology to sequence
337.672	leprosy bacteria in real time,
341.935	using mobile genome sequencers,
344.847	remote access to the Internet
347.88	and cloud computation.
350.44	But only if that's what
350.44	Hawaiian people want.
354.074	In our space,
355.394	on our terms.
358.367	IndiGenomics is about science
358.367	for the people by the people.
364.196	We'll be starting with a tribal
364.196	consultation resource,
368.165	focused on educating
368.165	indigenous communities
371.4	on the potential use and misuse
371.4	of genetic information.
374.861	Eventually we'd like to have our own
374.861	IndiGenomics research institute
378.195	to conduct our own experiments
379.648	and educate the next generation
379.648	of indigenous scientists.
383.523	In the end,
385.108	indigenous people need to be partners in
385.108	and not subjects of genetic research.
390.179	And for those on the outside,
392.156	just as Father Damien did,
394.625	the research community needs
394.625	to immerse itself in indigenous culture
399.007	or die trying.
400.984	Mahalo.
