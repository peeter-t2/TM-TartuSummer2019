16.272	Well, I was born with a rare visual condition
19.451	called achromatopsia, which is total color blindness,
23.164	so I've never seen color,
25.034	and I don't know what color looks like,
27.557	because I come from a grayscale world.
30.532	To me, the sky is always gray,
33.192	flowers are always gray,
35.044	and television is still in black and white.
37.246	But, since the age of 21,
39.539	instead of seeing color, I can hear color.
43.668	In 2003, I started a project
46.644	with computer scientist Adam Montandon,
49.332	and the result, with further collaborations
52.499	with Peter Kese from Slovenia
55.347	and Matias Lizana from Barcelona,
57.38	is this electronic eye.
59.745	It's a color sensor that detects
62.101	the color frequency in front of me — (Frequency sounds) —
65.684	and sends this frequency to a chip installed
68.036	at the back of my head, and I hear the color in front of me
71.027	through the bone, through bone conduction.
73.923	(Frequency sounds) So, for example, if I have, like —
80.984	This is the sound of purple. (Frequency sounds)
83.951	For example, this is the sound of grass. (Frequency sounds)
91.369	This is red, like TED. (Frequency sounds)
93.494	This is the sound of a dirty sock. (Laughter)
97.863	Which is like yellow, this one.
99.74	So I've been hearing color all the time for eight years,
103.797	since 2004, so I find it completely normal now
106.432	to hear color all the time.
108.911	At the start, though, I had to memorize the names you give
113.285	for each color, so I had to memorize the notes,
115.691	but after some time, all this information
117.627	became a perception.
119.62	I didn't have to think about the notes.
121.379	And after some time, this perception became a feeling.
124.004	I started to have favorite colors,
126.01	and I started to dream in colors.
127.784	So, when I started to dream in color is when I felt
132.059	that the software and my brain had united,
134.946	because in my dreams, it was my brain creating
137.902	electronic sounds. It wasn't the software,
140.263	so that's when I started to feel like a cyborg.
143.782	It's when I started to feel that the cybernetic device
146.832	was no longer a device.
149.022	It had become a part of my body,
151.437	an extension of my senses,
153.902	and after some time, it even became a part
156.528	of my official image.
160.055	This is my passport from 2004.
162.401	You're not allowed to appear on U.K. passports
165.486	with electronic equipment, but I insisted
168.298	to the passport office that what they were seeing
170.699	was actually a new part of my body,
173.203	an extension of my brain, and they finally accepted me
176.723	to appear with the passport photo.
179.234	So, life has changed dramatically since I hear color,
182.691	because color is almost everywhere,
185.285	so the biggest change for example is
188.162	going to an art gallery, I can listen to a Picasso,
192.7	for example. So it's like I'm going to a concert hall,
195.554	because I can listen to the paintings.
197.765	And supermarkets, I find this is very shocking,
200.226	it's very, very attractive to walk along a supermarket.
203.176	It's like going to a nightclub.
204.664	It's full of different melodies. (Laughter) Yeah.
207.92	Especially the aisle with cleaning products.
209.995	It's just fabulous. (Laughter)
213.346	Also, the way I dress has changed.
215.818	Before, I used to dress in a way that it looked good.
218.226	Now I dress in a way that it sounds good. (Laughter)
222.803	(Applause)
227.934	So today I'm dressed in C major,
230.443	so it's quite a happy chord. (Laughter)
233.752	If I had to go to a funeral, though,
235.626	I would dress in B minor, which would be
238.193	turquoise, purple and orange. (Laughter)
246.952	Also, food, the way I look at food has changed,
251.297	because now I can display the food on a plate,
254.753	so I can eat my favorite song. (Laughter)
257.705	So depending on how I display it,
258.934	I can hear and I can compose music with food.
261.684	So imagine a restaurant where we can have, like,
264.409	Lady Gaga salads as starters. (Laughter) I mean,
267.393	this would get teenagers to eat their vegetables, probably.
270.41	And also, some Rachmaninov piano concertos
273.849	as main dishes, and some Bjork or Madonna desserts,
277.083	that would be a very exciting restaurant
280.192	where you can actually eat songs.
282.952	Also, the way I perceive beauty has changed,
287.402	because when I look at someone, I hear their face,
292.082	so someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible.
297.084	(Laughter) And it might happen the opposite,
298.845	the other way around. So I really enjoy creating, like,
301.093	sound portraits of people.
302.822	Instead of drawing someone's face, like drawing the shape,
306.462	I point at them with the eye and I write down
308.893	the different notes I hear, and then I create sound portraits.
312.164	Here's some faces.
313.901	(Musical chords)
328.428	Yeah, Nicole Kidman sounds good. (Laughter)
331.861	Some people, I would never relate, but they sound similar.
334.91	Prince Charles has some similarities with Nicole Kidman.
337.708	They have similar sound of eyes.
339.845	So you relate people that you wouldn't relate,
341.893	and you can actually also create concerts
345.406	by looking at the audience faces.
348.046	So I connect the eye, and then I play the audience's faces.
351.142	The good thing about this is,
352.646	if the concert doesn't sound good, it's their fault.
355.613	It's not my fault, because — (Laughter)
357.884	And so another thing that happens is that
362.191	I started having this secondary effect
365.068	that normal sounds started to become color.
368.398	I heard a telephone tone, and it felt green
372.159	because it sounded just like the color green.
374.485	The BBC beeps, they sound turquoise,
377.783	and listening to Mozart became a yellow experience,
380.91	so I started to paint music and paint people's voices,
385.67	because people's voices have frequencies
387.613	that I relate to color.
389.156	And here's some music translated into color.
394.275	"For example, Mozart, ""Queen of the Night,"" looks like this."
399.475	(Music) Very yellow and very colorful,
401.287	because there's many different frequencies.
403.477	(Music)
407.403	And this is a completely different song.
409.717	"(Music) It's Justin Bieber's ""Baby."" (Laughter)"
413.648	(Music)
415.379	It is very pink and very yellow.
418.949	So, also voices, I can transform speeches into color,
426.116	for example, these are two very well-known speeches.
429.66	"One of them is Martin Luther King's ""I Have A Dream,"""
433.397	and the other one is Hitler.
434.849	And I like to exhibit these paintings in the exhibition halls
438.325	without labels, and then I ask people,
440.901	"""Which one do you prefer?"""
442.748	And most people change their preference
445.013	when I tell them that the one on the left is Hitler
447.924	and the one on the right is Martin Luther King.
451.044	So I got to a point when I was able to perceive 360 colors,
456.783	just like human vision.
458.368	I was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel.
461.963	But then, I just thought that
464.045	this human vision wasn't good enough.
467.284	There's many, many more colors around us
469.495	that we cannot perceive,
471.332	but that electronic eyes can perceive.
473.088	So I decided to continue extending my color senses,
476.817	and I added infrared and I added ultraviolet
481.067	to the color-to-sound scale, so now I can hear colors
484.425	that the human eye cannot perceive.
486.649	For example, perceiving infrared is good because you can
490.096	actually detect if there's movement detectors in a room.
494.164	I can hear if someone points at me with a remote control.
497.617	And the good thing about perceiving ultraviolet is that
500.767	you can hear if it's a good day or a bad day to sunbathe,
505.732	because ultraviolet is a dangerous color,
507.889	a color that can actually kill us, so I think we should all have this wish
511.873	to perceive things that we cannot perceive.
514.834	That's why, two years ago,
516.569	I created the Cyborg Foundation,
518.25	which is a foundation that tries to help people
520.692	become a cyborg, tries to encourage people
523.389	to extend their senses
524.766	by using technology as part of the body.
527.837	We should all think that knowledge comes from our senses,
531.74	so if we extend our senses,
533.716	we will consequently extend our knowledge.
536.804	I think life will be much more exciting
539.597	when we stop creating applications for mobile phones
542.821	and we start creating applications for our own body.
546.222	I think this will be a big, big change
548.038	that we will see during this century.
550.116	So I do encourage you all to think about which senses
554.031	you'd like to extend.
555.45	I would encourage you to become a cyborg.
558.623	You won't be alone. Thank you. (Applause)
563.271	(Applause)
