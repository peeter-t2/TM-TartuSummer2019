16.26	The greatest irony in global health
18.26	is that the poorest countries
20.26	carry the largest disease burden.
23.26	If we resize the countries of the globe
25.26	in proportion to the subject of interest,
27.26	we see that Sub-Saharan Africa
29.26	is the worst hit region by HIV/AIDS.
32.26	This is the most devastating epidemic of our time.
35.26	We also see that this region
37.26	has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease.
40.26	There are very few doctors
42.26	and, quite frankly, these countries do not have the resources
44.26	that are needed to cope
46.26	with such epidemics.
48.26	So what the Western countries,
50.26	developed countries, have generously done
52.26	is they have proposed to provide free drugs
54.26	to all people in Third World countries
56.26	who actually can't afford these medications.
58.26	And this has already saved millions of lives,
61.26	and it has prevented entire economies
63.26	from capsizing in Sub-Saharan Africa.
66.26	But there is a fundamental problem
70.26	that is killing the efforts
72.26	in fighting this disease,
74.26	because if you keep throwing
76.26	drugs out at people
79.26	who don't have diagnostic services,
81.26	you end up creating a problem of drug resistance.
84.26	This is already beginning to happen in Sub-Saharan Africa.
87.26	The problem is that,
89.26	what begins as a tragedy in the Third World
92.26	could easily become a global problem.
94.26	And the last thing we want to see
96.26	is drug-resistant strains of HIV
98.26	popping up all over the world,
100.26	because it will make treatment more expensive
103.26	and it could also restore
106.26	the pre-ARV carnage of HIV/AIDS.
108.26	I experienced this firsthand
110.26	as a high school student in Uganda.
112.26	This was in the 90s
114.26	during the peak of the HIV epidemic,
116.26	before there were any ARVs in Sub-Saharan Africa.
119.26	And during that time, I actually lost more relatives,
122.26	as well as the teachers who taught me,
124.26	to HIV/AIDS.
126.26	So this became one of the driving passions of my life,
129.26	to help find real solutions
132.26	that could address these kinds of problems.
136.26	We all know about the miracle of miniaturization.
139.26	Back in the day, computers used to fill this entire room,
142.26	and people actually used to work inside the computers.
145.26	But what electronic miniaturization has done
148.26	is that it has allowed people to shrink
150.26	technology into a cell phone.
152.26	And I'm sure everyone here enjoys cell phones
154.26	that can actually be used in the remote areas of the world,
157.26	in the Third World countries.
160.26	The good news is that the same technology
162.26	that allowed miniaturization of electronics
164.26	is now allowing us to miniaturize
167.26	biological laboratories.
169.26	So, right now, we can actually miniaturize
171.26	biological and chemistry laboratories
174.26	onto microfluidic chips.
176.26	I was very lucky to come
178.26	to the US right after high school,
180.26	and was able to work on this technology
182.26	and develop some devices.
185.26	This is a microfluidic chip that I developed.
188.26	A close look at how the technology works:
190.26	These are channels that are about the size of a human hair --
193.26	so you have integrated valves, pumps, mixers and injectors --
196.26	so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments
199.26	onto a microfluidic system.
202.26	So what I plan to do with this technology
204.26	is to actually take the current state
206.26	of the technology
208.26	and build an HIV kit
210.26	in a microfluidic system.
212.26	So, with one microfluidic chip,
214.26	which is the size of an iPhone,
217.26	you can actually diagnose
222.26	For each patient, we will be able to do
224.26	up to 100 different viral loads per patient.
227.26	And this is only done in four hours,
232.26	at a cost that will be five to 500 times cheaper
235.26	than the current options.
237.26	So this will allow us to create
239.26	personalized medicines in the Third World
242.26	at a cost that is actually achievable
245.26	and make the world a safer place.
247.26	I invite your interest
249.26	as well as your involvement
251.26	in driving this vision
253.26	to a point of practical reality.
255.26	Thank you very much.
257.26	(Applause)
