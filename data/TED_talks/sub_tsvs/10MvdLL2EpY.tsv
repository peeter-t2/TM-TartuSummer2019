13.58	[On April 3, 2016 we saw
13.58	the largest data leak in history.]
18.061	[The Panama Papers exposed
18.061	rich and powerful people]
20.932	[hiding vast amounts of money
20.932	in offshore accounts.]
23.828	[What does this mean?]
27.312	[We called Robert Palmer
27.312	of Global Witness to explain.]
32.852	This week, there have been
32.852	a whole slew and deluge of stories
37.828	coming out from the leak
37.828	of 11 million documents
41.148	from a Panamanian-based law firm
41.148	called Mossack Fonseca.
45.596	The release of these papers from Panama
45.596	lifts the veil on a tiny piece
51.402	of the secretive offshore world.
53.664	We get an insight into how clients
53.664	and banks and lawyers
58.996	go to companies like Mossack Fonseca
61.048	"and say, ""OK, we want"
61.048	an anonymous company,
63.579	"can you give us one?"""
64.995	So you actually get to see the emails,
66.829	you get to see the exchanges of messages,
68.816	you get to see the mechanics
68.816	of how this works,
71.915	how this operates.
73.34	Now, this has already started
73.34	to have pretty immediate repercussions.
77.417	The Prime Minister
77.417	of Iceland has resigned.
80.042	We've also had news
81.281	that an ally of the brutal
81.281	Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad
86.348	has also got offshore companies.
88.927	There's been allegations
88.927	of a $2 billion money trail
94.18	that leads back to President
94.18	Vladimir Putin of Russia
98.107	via his close childhood friend,
100.592	who happens to be a top cellist.
102.844	And there will be a lot
102.844	of rich individuals out there
105.468	and others who will be nervous
105.468	about the next set of stories
109.81	and the next set of leaked documents.
112.387	Now, this sounds like the plot
112.387	of a spy thriller
116.597	or a John Grisham novel.
118.284	It seems very distant
118.284	from you, me, ordinary people.
122.324	Why should we care about this?
124.856	But the truth is that if rich
124.856	and powerful individuals
129.123	are able to keep their money offshore
131.801	and not pay the taxes that they should,
134.312	it means that there is less money
134.312	for vital public services
138.43	like healthcare, education, roads.
141.807	And that affects all of us.
144.152	Now, for my organization Global Witness,
146.892	this exposé has been phenomenal.
150.978	We have the world's media
150.978	and political leaders
155.49	talking about how individuals
155.49	can use offshore secrecy
160.169	to hide and disguise their assets --
162.588	something we have been talking about
162.588	and exposing for a decade.
167.396	Now, I think a lot of people find
167.396	this entire world baffling and confusing,
172.055	and hard to understand how
172.055	this sort of offshore world works.
176.544	I like to think of it a bit
176.544	like a Russian doll.
179.4	So you can have one company
179.4	stacked inside another company,
182.883	stacked inside another company,
185.018	making it almost impossible
185.018	to really understand
189.453	who is behind these structures.
191.704	It can be very difficult
191.704	for law enforcement
194.641	or tax authorities,
194.641	journalists, civil society
197.628	to really understand what's going on.
200.318	I also think it's interesting
201.779	that there's been less coverage
201.779	of this issue in the United States.
205.01	And that's perhaps because
205.01	some prominent US people
208.797	just haven't figured
208.797	in this exposé, in this scandal.
213.359	Now, that's not because
213.359	there are no rich Americans
217.318	who are stashing their assets offshore.
220.152	It's just because of the way
220.152	in which offshore works,
223.998	Mossack Fonseca has fewer
223.998	American clients.
227.512	I think if we saw leaks
227.512	from the Cayman Islands
230.792	or even from Delaware
230.792	or Wyoming or Nevada,
234.467	you would see many more cases
234.467	and examples linking back to Americans.
240.283	In fact, in a number of US states
240.283	you need less information,
246.225	you need to provide less
246.225	information to get a company
250.423	than you do to get a library card.
253.24	That sort of secrecy in America
253.24	has allowed employees of school districts
259.046	to rip off schoolchildren.
260.976	It has allowed scammers
260.976	to rip off vulnerable investors.
266.452	This is the sort of behavior
266.452	that affects all of us.
270.166	Now, at Global Witness,
272.061	we wanted to see what this
272.061	actually looked like in practice.
275.346	How does this actually work?
277.783	So what we did
278.982	is we sent in an undercover investigator
278.982	to 13 Manhattan law firms.
285.763	Our investigator posed
285.763	as an African minister
289.561	who wanted to move suspect funds
289.561	into the United States
293.712	to buy a house, a yacht, a jet.
297.288	Now, what was truly shocking
297.288	was that all but one of those lawyers
302.373	provided our investigator with suggestions
306.99	on how to move those suspect funds.
308.978	These were all preliminary meetings,
310.814	and none of the lawyers
310.814	took us on as a client
313.11	and of course no money moved hands,
315.423	but it really shows the problem
315.423	with the system.
318.905	It's also important
320.848	to not just think about this
320.848	as individual cases.
324.238	This is not just about
324.238	an individual lawyer
326.475	who's spoken to our undercover
326.475	investigator and provided suggestions.
330.353	It's not just about
330.353	a particular senior politician
333.232	who's been caught up in a scandal.
334.885	This is about how a system works,
337.965	that entrenches corruption,
337.965	tax evasion, poverty and instability.
343.932	And in order to tackle this,
345.771	we need to change the game.
347.466	We need to change the rules of the game
350.012	to make this sort of behavior harder.
352.028	This may seem like doom and gloom,
354.996	like there's nothing we can do about it,
356.941	like nothing has ever changed,
358.595	like there will always be rich
358.595	and powerful individuals.
361.955	But as a natural optimist,
364.426	I do see that we are starting
364.426	to get some change.
367.928	Over the last couple of years,
369.827	we've seen a real push towards
369.827	greater transparency
373.519	when it comes to company ownership.
375.755	This issue was put on the political agenda
378.116	by the UK Prime Minister David Cameron
380.634	at a big G8 Summit that was held
380.634	in Northern Ireland in 2013.
385.872	And since then, the European Union
385.872	is going to be creating
390.246	central registers at a national level
392.427	of who really owns and controls
392.427	companies across Europe.
395.858	One of the things that is sad is that,
395.858	actually, the US is lagging behind.
400.958	There's bipartisan legislation
400.958	that had been introduced
403.682	in the House and the Senate,
405.609	but it isn't making as much progress
405.609	as we'd like to see.
408.79	So we'd really want to see
408.79	the Panama leaks,
411.901	this huge peek into the offshore world,
415.719	be used as a way of opening up
415.719	in the US and around the world.
420.795	For us at Global Witness,
420.795	this is a moment for change.
425.95	We need ordinary people to get angry
429.722	at the way in which people
429.722	can hide their identity
432.999	behind secret companies.
434.936	We need business leaders
434.936	to stand up and say,
438.547	"""Secrecy like this is not"
438.547	"good for business."""
441.855	We need political leaders
441.855	to recognize the problem,
446.259	and to commit to changing the law
446.259	to open up this sort of secrecy.
451.639	Together, we can end the secrecy
454.942	that is currently allowing tax evasion,
458.023	corruption, money laundering to flourish.
