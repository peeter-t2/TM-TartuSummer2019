12.776	I want to talk about sex for money.
15.413	I'm not like most of the people
15.413	you'll have heard speaking
18.207	about prostitution before.
19.539	I'm not a police officer
19.539	or a social worker.
23.11	I'm not an academic,
23.11	a journalist or a politician.
26.329	And as you'll probably have
26.329	picked up from Maryam's blurb,
29.101	I'm not a nun, either.
30.326	(Laughter)
31.439	Most of those people would tell you
31.439	that selling sex is degrading;
35.431	that no one would ever choose to do it;
37.59	that it's dangerous;
37.59	women get abused and killed.
41.039	In fact, most of those people would say,
42.99	"""There should be a law against it!"""
44.802	Maybe that sounds reasonable to you.
47.896	It sounded reasonable to me
47.896	until the closing months of 2009,
51.832	when I was working two dead-end,
51.832	minimum-wage jobs.
55.789	Every month my wages would just
55.789	replenish my overdraft.
59.072	I was exhausted and my life
59.072	was going nowhere.
62.124	Like many others before me,
64.057	I decided sex for money
64.057	was a better option.
67.203	Now don't get me wrong --
68.465	I would have loved
68.465	to have won the lottery instead.
70.896	But it wasn't going
70.896	to happen anytime soon,
73.015	and my rent needed paying.
74.832	So I signed up for my first
74.832	shift in a brothel.
78.255	In the years that have passed,
80.044	I've had a lot of time to think.
82.296	I've reconsidered the ideas
82.296	I once had about prostitution.
85.941	I've given a lot of thought to consent
87.87	and the nature of work under capitalism.
90.552	I've thought about gender inequality
92.362	and the sexual and reproductive
92.362	labor of women.
95.497	I've experienced exploitation
95.497	and violence at work.
99.142	I've thought about what's needed
100.741	to protect other sex workers
100.741	from these things.
102.995	Maybe you've thought about them, too.
105.128	In this talk,
106.309	I'll take you through
106.309	the four main legal approaches
108.802	applied to sex work throughout the world,
110.81	and explain why they don't work;
112.397	why prohibiting the sex industry
112.397	actually exacerbates every harm
115.579	that sex workers are vulnerable to.
118.122	Then I'm going tell you about what we,
118.122	as sex workers, actually want.
123.508	The first approach
123.508	is full criminalization.
126.926	Half the world,
128.1	including Russia, South Africa
128.1	and most of the US,
130.618	regulates sex work by criminalizing
130.618	everyone involved.
133.569	So that's seller, buyer and third parties.
136.721	Lawmakers in these countries
136.721	apparently hope
138.83	that the fear of getting arrested
138.83	will deter people from selling sex.
142.726	But if you're forced to choose
142.726	between obeying the law
145.302	and feeding yourself or your family,
147.31	you're going to do the work anyway,
149.111	and take the risk.
150.57	Criminalization is a trap.
152.938	It's hard to get a conventional job
152.938	when you have a criminal record.
156.609	Potential employers won't hire you.
158.995	Assuming you still need money,
160.449	you'll stay in the more flexible,
160.449	informal economy.
163.264	The law forces you to keep selling sex,
165.8	which is the exact opposite
165.8	of its intended effect.
169.433	Being criminalized leaves you exposed
169.433	to mistreatment by the state itself.
173.568	In many places you may be coerced
173.568	into paying a bribe
176.357	or even into having sex
176.357	with a police officer
178.736	to avoid arrest.
180.432	Police and prison guards
180.432	in Cambodia, for example,
183.384	have been documented
183.384	subjecting sex workers
185.432	to what can only be described as torture:
187.745	threats at gunpoint,
188.92	beatings, electric shocks, rape
191.736	and denial of food.
193.633	Another worrying thing:
195.337	if you're selling sex in places
195.337	like Kenya, South Africa or New York,
199.76	a police officer can arrest you
199.76	if you're caught carrying condoms,
203.48	because condoms can legally be used
203.48	as evidence that you're selling sex.
207.506	Obviously, this increases HIV risk.
209.972	Imagine knowing if you're busted
209.972	carrying condoms,
212.456	it'll be used against you.
214.334	It's a pretty strong incentive
214.334	to leave them at home, right?
217.36	Sex workers working in these places
217.36	are forced to make a tough choice
220.69	between risking arrest
220.69	or having risky sex.
224.033	What would you choose?
225.77	Would you pack condoms to go to work?
228.447	How about if you're worried
229.773	the police officer would rape you
229.773	when he got you in the van?
233.285	The second approach to regulating
233.285	sex work seen in these countries
236.832	is partial criminalization,
238.248	where the buying and selling
238.248	of sex are legal,
240.824	but surrounding activities,
242.143	like brothel-keeping or soliciting
242.143	on the street, are banned.
245.862	Laws like these --
247.046	we have them in the UK and in France --
248.959	essentially say to us sex workers,
250.641	"""Hey, we don't mind you selling sex,"
252.483	just make sure it's done
252.483	behind closed doors
254.594	"and all alone."""
256.105	And brothel-keeping, by the way,
257.914	is defined as just two or more
257.914	sex workers working together.
260.977	Making that illegal means
260.977	that many of us work alone,
263.834	which obviously makes us
263.834	vulnerable to violent offenders.
266.681	But we're also vulnerable
267.935	if we choose to break the law
267.935	by working together.
271.429	A couple of years ago,
272.603	a friend of mine was nervous
272.603	after she was attacked at work,
275.496	so I said that she could see her clients
275.496	from my place for a while.
279.209	During that time,
280.455	we had another guy turn nasty.
282.411	I told the guy to leave
282.411	or I'd call the police.
285.163	And he looked at the two of us and said,
287.778	"""You girls can't call the cops."
289.912	You're working together,
289.912	"this place is illegal."""
292.684	He was right.
293.871	He eventually left
293.871	without getting physically violent,
296.478	but the knowledge
296.478	that we were breaking the law
298.726	empowered that man to threaten us.
300.44	He felt confident he'd get away with it.
302.829	The prohibition of street prostitution
302.829	also causes more harm
305.768	than it prevents.
306.944	Firstly, to avoid getting arrested,
308.96	street workers take risks
308.96	to avoid detection,
311.247	and that means working alone
312.634	or in isolated locations like dark forests
314.693	where they're vulnerable to attack.
316.769	If you're caught selling sex outdoors,
318.69	you pay a fine.
320.353	How do you pay that fine
320.353	without going back to the streets?
323.176	It was the need for money
323.176	that saw you in the streets
325.747	in the first place.
326.922	And so the fines stack up,
328.469	and you're caught in a vicious cycle
330.231	of selling sex to pay the fines
330.231	you got for selling sex.
334.17	Let me tell you about Mariana Popa
334.17	who worked in Redbridge, East London.
337.916	The street workers on her patch
337.916	would normally wait for clients in groups
341.467	for safety in numbers
342.787	and to warn each other about how
342.787	to avoid dangerous guys.
346.142	But during a police crackdown
346.142	on sex workers and their clients,
349.834	she was forced to work alone
349.834	to avoid being arrested.
353.446	She was stabbed to death
353.446	in the early hours of October 29, 2013.
358.009	She had been working later than usual
359.838	to try to pay off a fine
359.838	she had received for soliciting.
363.994	So if criminalizing
363.994	sex workers hurts them,
366.753	why not just criminalize
366.753	the people who buy sex?
369.854	This is the aim of the third approach
371.716	I want to talk about --
372.898	the Swedish or Nordic
372.898	model of sex-work law.
375.01	The idea behind this law
376.261	is that selling sex
376.261	is intrinsically harmful
378.748	and so you're, in fact, helping
378.748	sex workers by removing the option.
382.839	Despite growing support
384.026	for what's often described
384.026	"as the ""end demand"" approach,"
386.732	there's no evidence that it works.
388.399	There's just as much prostitution
388.399	in Sweden as there was before.
391.762	Why might that be?
394.039	It's because people selling sex
395.591	often don't have other options for income.
397.731	If you need that money,
398.907	the only effect that a drop
398.907	in business is going have
401.413	is to force you to lower your prices
403.162	or offer more risky sexual services.
405.591	If you need to find more clients,
407.188	you might seek the help of a manager.
409.01	So you see, rather than putting a stop
411.014	to what's often descried as pimping,
412.871	a law like this actually gives oxygen
414.915	to potentially abusive third parties.
417.606	To keep safe in my work,
419.443	I try not to take bookings from someone
421.36	who calls me from a withheld number.
423.134	If it's a home or a hotel visit,
425.083	I try to get a full name and details.
427.703	If I worked under the Swedish model,
429.854	a client would be too scared
429.854	to give me that information.
432.576	I might have no other choice
434.038	but to accept a booking
434.038	from a man who is untraceable
437.013	if he later turns out to be violent.
439.832	If you need their money,
441.071	you need to protect
441.071	your clients from the police.
443.467	If you work outdoors,
444.648	that means working alone
444.648	or in isolated locations,
447.235	just as if you were criminalized yourself.
449.474	It might mean getting into cars quicker,
452.084	less negotiating time
452.084	means snap decisions.
455.015	Is this guy dangerous or just nervous?
458.142	Can you afford to take the risk?
460.492	Can you afford not to?
463.555	Something I'm often hearing is,
465.068	"""Prostitution would be fine"
466.42	"if we made it legal and regulated it."""
468.825	We call that approach legalization,
470.626	and it's used by countries
470.626	like the Netherlands, Germany
473.446	and Nevada in the US.
475.666	But it's not a great
475.666	model for human rights.
477.787	And in state-controlled prostitution,
479.616	commercial sex can only happen
481.203	in certain legally-designated
481.203	areas or venues,
483.52	and sex workers are made to comply
483.52	with special restrictions,
486.534	like registration
486.534	and forced health checks.
490.014	Regulation sounds great on paper,
492.187	but politicians deliberately make
492.187	regulation around the sex industry
495.491	expensive and difficult to comply with.
498.182	It creates a two-tiered system:
498.182	legal and illegal work.
502.55	We sometimes call it
502.55	"""backdoor criminalization."""
505.576	Rich, well-connected brothel owners
505.576	can comply with the regulations,
509.021	but more marginalized people
509.021	find those hoops
511.218	impossible to jump through.
513.196	And even if it's possible in principle,
515.19	getting a license or proper venue
515.19	takes time and costs money.
518.199	It's not going to be an option
519.702	for someone who's desperate
519.702	and needs money tonight.
522.18	They might be a refugee
522.18	or fleeing domestic abuse.
525.246	In this two-tiered system,
526.809	the most vulnerable people
526.809	are forced to work illegally,
530.07	so they're still exposed to all
530.07	the dangers of criminalization
533.11	I mentioned earlier.
534.57	So.
535.753	It's looking like all attempts to control
537.859	or prevent sex work from happening
539.565	makes things more dangerous
539.565	for people selling sex.
542.682	Fear of law enforcement makes them
542.682	work alone in isolated locations,
546.132	and allows clients and even cops
547.863	to get abusive in the knowledge
547.863	they'll get away with it.
550.656	Fines and criminal records force
550.656	people to keep selling sex,
553.841	rather than enabling them to stop.
556.325	Crackdowns on buyers drive sellers
556.325	to take dangerous risks
559.126	and into the arms
559.126	of potentially abusive managers.
561.487	These laws also reinforce stigma
561.487	and hatred against sex workers.
565.278	When France temporarily brought in
565.278	the Swedish model two years ago,
568.651	ordinary citizens took it as a cue
570.65	to start carrying out vigilante attacks
572.625	against people working on the street.
574.788	In Sweden, opinion surveys show
576.81	that significantly more people want
576.81	sex workers to be arrested now
580.789	than before the law was brought in.
583.625	If prohibition is this harmful,
585.771	you might ask, why it so popular?
588.832	Firstly, sex work is and always
588.832	has been a survival strategy
591.799	for all kinds of unpopular
591.799	minority groups:
594.731	people of color,
595.958	migrants,
597.133	people with disabilities,
598.381	LGBTQ people,
599.6	particularly trans women.
601.924	These are the groups most heavily profiled
604.054	and punished through prohibitionist law.
606.404	I don't think this is an accident.
608.404	These laws have political support
610.267	precisely because they target people
612.93	that voters don't want
612.93	to see or know about.
616.688	Why else might people support prohibition?
619.465	Well, lots of people have
619.465	understandable fears about trafficking.
623.664	Folks think that foreign women
623.664	kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery
627.535	can be saved by shutting
627.535	a whole industry down.
630.555	So let's talk about trafficking.
633.156	Forced labor does occur
633.156	in many industries,
636.763	especially those where the workers
636.763	are migrants or otherwise vulnerable,
640.366	and this needs to be addressed.
642.535	But it's best addressed with legislation
642.535	targeting those specific abuses,
646.838	not an entire industry.
648.791	When 23 undocumented Chinese migrants
651.192	drowned while picking cockles
651.192	in Morecambe Bay in 2004,
654.133	there were no calls to outlaw
654.133	the entire seafood industry
657.093	to save trafficking victims.
659.178	The solution is clearly to give
659.178	workers more legal protections,
662.557	allowing them to resist abuse
664.35	and report it to authorities
664.35	without fear of arrest.
667.414	The way the term trafficking
667.414	is thrown around
669.738	implies that all undocumented
669.738	migration into prostitution is forced.
674.423	In fact, many migrants
674.423	have made a decision,
677.453	out of economic need,
678.731	to place themselves into the hands
678.731	of people smugglers.
681.538	Many do this with the full knowledge
683.344	that they'll be selling sex
683.344	when they reach their destination.
686.571	And yes, it can often be the case
688.348	that these people smugglers
688.348	demand exorbitant fees,
691.617	coerce migrants into work
691.617	they don't want to do
694.545	and abuse them when they're vulnerable.
696.456	That's true of prostitution,
697.983	but it's also true of agricultural work,
699.954	hospitality work and domestic work.
702.653	Ultimately, nobody wants
702.653	to be forced to do any kind of work,
706.07	but that's a risk many migrants
706.07	are willing to take,
708.595	because of what they're leaving behind.
710.489	If people were allowed to migrate legally
712.473	they wouldn't have to place their lives
712.473	into the hands of people smugglers.
716.034	The problems arise
717.209	from the criminalization of migration,
719.058	just as they do from the criminalization
721.043	of sex work itself.
722.218	This is a lesson of history.
723.824	If you try to prohibit something
723.824	that people want or need to do,
727.494	whether that's drinking alcohol
727.494	or crossing borders
731.093	or getting an abortion
732.406	or selling sex,
734.371	you create more problems than you solve.
736.395	Prohibition barely makes a difference
738.208	to the amount of people
738.208	actually doing those things.
740.672	But it makes a huge difference
742.177	as to whether or not
742.177	they're safe when they do them.
745.591	Why else might people support prohibition?
748.787	As a feminist, I know
748.787	that the sex industry is a site
752.177	of deeply entrenched social inequality.
755.081	It's a fact that most buyers of sex
755.081	are men with money,
758.157	and most sellers are women without.
760.472	You can agree with all that -- I do --
763.391	and still think prohibition
763.391	is a terrible policy.
766.783	In a better, more equal world,
768.945	maybe there would be far fewer
768.945	people selling sex to survive,
772.597	but you can't simply legislate
772.597	a better world into existence.
776.232	If someone needs to sell sex
776.232	because they're poor
778.742	or because they're homeless
780.208	or because they're undocumented
780.208	and they can't find legal work,
783.374	taking away that option
783.374	doesn't make them any less poor
786.953	or house them
788.6	or change their immigration status.
790.577	People worry that selling
790.577	sex is degrading.
793.634	Ask yourself: is it more degrading
793.634	than going hungry
796.926	or seeing your children go hungry?
799.366	There's no call to ban rich people
799.366	from hiring nannies
802.394	or getting manicures,
803.671	even though most of the people
803.671	doing that labor are poor, migrant women.
807.321	It's the fact of poor migrant women
807.321	selling sex specifically
811.489	that has some feminists uncomfortable.
814.481	And I can understand
815.658	why the sex industry provokes
815.658	strong feelings.
818.407	People have all kinds
818.407	of complicated feelings
821.454	when it comes to sex.
823.546	But we can't make policy
823.546	on the basis of mere feelings,
826.815	especially not over
826.815	the heads of the people
828.901	actually effected by those policies.
830.663	If we get fixated on
830.663	the abolition of sex work,
833.306	we end up worrying more
833.306	about a particular manifestation
835.994	of gender inequality,
837.431	rather than about the underlying causes.
840.333	People get really hung up on the question,
842.788	"""Well, would you want"
842.788	"your daughter doing it?"""
845.28	That's the wrong question.
847.217	Instead, imagine she is doing it.
850.542	How safe is she at work tonight?
853.155	Why isn't she safer?
856.497	So we've looked at full criminalization,
859.442	partial criminalization,
859.442	the Swedish or Nordic Model
862.469	and legalization,
863.683	and how they all cause harm.
865.359	Something I never hear asked is:
868.839	"""What do sex workers want?"""
871.573	After all, we're the ones
871.573	most affected by these laws.
875.115	New Zealand decriminalized
875.115	sex work in 2003.
878.532	It's crucial to remember
880.457	that decriminalization and legalization
880.457	are not the same thing.
883.932	Decriminalization means
883.932	the removal of laws
886.841	that punitively target the sex industry,
888.908	instead treating sex work
888.908	much like any other kind of work.
892.354	In New Zealand, people
892.354	can work together for safety,
895.191	and employers of sex workers
895.191	are accountable to the state.
897.968	A sex worker can refuse
897.968	to see a client at any time,
900.675	for any reason,
902.159	and 96 percent of street workers
904.657	report that they feel the law
904.657	protects their rights.
907.822	New Zealand hasn't actually
907.822	seen an increase
909.94	in the amount of people doing sex work,
912.075	but decriminalizing it
912.075	has made it a lot safer.
915.274	But the lesson from New Zealand
916.875	isn't just that its particular
916.875	legislation is good,
919.296	but that crucially,
920.471	it was written in collaboration
920.471	with sex workers;
922.814	namely, the New Zealand
922.814	Prostitutes' Collective.
925.147	When it came to making sex work safer,
927.5	they were ready to hear it straight
927.5	from sex workers themselves.
931.251	Here in the UK,
932.425	I'm part of sex worker-led groups
932.425	like the Sex Worker Open University
935.867	and the English Collective of Prostitutes.
937.986	And we form part of a global movement
939.805	demanding decriminalization
939.805	and self-determination.
943.653	The universal symbol of our movement
943.653	is the red umbrella.
946.417	We're supported in our demands
946.417	by global bodies like UNAIDS,
949.542	the World Health Organization
951.166	and Amnesty International.
952.924	But we need more allies.
955.181	If you care about gender equality
957.541	or poverty or migration or public health,
960.361	then sex worker rights matter to you.
963.355	Make space for us in your movements.
965.402	That means not only listening
965.402	to sex workers when we speak
968.662	but amplifying our voices.
971.219	Resist those who silence us,
973.364	those who say that a prostitute
973.364	is either too victimized,
976.567	too damaged to know
976.567	what's best for herself,
979.237	or else too privileged
980.997	and too removed from real hardship,
983.209	not representative of the millions
983.209	of voiceless victims.
987.709	This distinction between victim
987.709	and empowered is imaginary.
992.536	It exists purely to discredit sex workers
995.013	and make it easy to ignore us.
997.819	No doubt many of you work for a living.
1000.56	Well, sex work is work, too.
1002.877	Just like you,
1004.057	some of us like our jobs,
1005.687	some of us hate them.
1007.77	Ultimately, most of us
1007.77	have mixed feelings.
1011.238	But how we feel about our work
1014.566	isn't the point.
1016.484	And how others feel
1016.484	about our work certainly isn't.
1020.373	What's important is that we have
1020.373	the right to work safely
1023.145	and on our own terms.
1024.477	Sex workers are real people.
1026.823	We've had complicated experiences
1029.655	and complicated responses
1029.655	to those experiences.
1033.651	But our demands are not complicated.
1036.451	You can ask expensive
1036.451	escorts in New York City,
1039.272	brothel workers in Cambodia,
1039.272	street workers in South Africa
1042.234	and every girl on the roster
1042.234	at my old job in Soho,
1045.377	and they will all tell you the same thing.
1047.741	You can speak to millions of sex workers
1050.006	and countless sex work-led organizations.
1052.487	We want full decriminalization
1052.487	and labor rights as workers.
1056.985	I'm just one sex worker
1056.985	on the stage today,
1059.325	but I'm bringing a message
1059.325	from all over the world.
1061.919	Thank you.
1063.111	(Applause)
