12.796	So, this happy pic of me
12.796	was taken in 1999.
15.964	I was a senior in college,
18.078	and it was right after a dance practice.
20.034	I was really, really happy.
22.148	And I remember exactly where I was
22.148	about a week and a half later.
26.058	I was sitting in the back
26.058	of my used minivan
29.301	in a campus parking lot,
31.088	when I decided
32.263	I was going to commit suicide.
35.796	I went from deciding
35.796	to full-blown planning very quickly.
40.388	And I came this close
40.388	to the edge of the precipice.
43.407	It's the closest I've ever come.
45.529	And the only reason I took
45.529	my finger off the trigger
48.505	was thanks to a few lucky coincidences.
51.499	And after the fact,
53.214	that's what scared me the most:
53.214	the element of chance.
57.062	So I became very methodical
57.062	about testing different ways
60.278	that I could manage my ups and downs,
62.432	which has proven to be
62.432	a good investment. (Laughs)
66.301	Many normal people might have,
66.301	say, six to 10 major depressive episodes
70.501	in their lives.
72.052	I have bipolar depression.
72.052	It runs in my family.
74.402	I've had 50-plus at this point,
77.451	and I've learned a lot.
79.715	I've had a lot of at-bats,
81.592	many rounds in the ring with darkness,
83.957	taking good notes.
85.781	So I thought rather than get up
85.781	and give any type of recipe for success
89.14	or highlight reel,
90.317	I would share my recipe
90.317	for avoiding self-destruction,
95.061	and certainly self-paralysis.
98.249	And the tool I've found which has proven
98.249	to be the most reliable safety net
102.059	for emotional free fall
104.503	is actually the same tool
106.096	that has helped me to make
106.096	my best business decisions.
108.721	But that is secondary.
110.553	And it is ... stoicism.
113.694	That sounds boring.
115.242	(Laughter)
116.329	You might think of Spock,
117.969	or it might conjure and image like this --
120.508	(Laughter)
122.008	a cow standing in the rain.
124.44	It's not sad. It's not particularly happy.
127.354	It's just an impassive creature taking
127.354	whatever life sends its way.
131.673	You might not think of the ultimate
131.673	competitor, say, Bill Belichick,
136.139	head coach of the New England Patriots,
138.419	who has the all-time NFL record
138.419	for Super Bowl titles.
141.492	And stoicism has spread like wildfire
141.492	in the top of the NFL ranks
146.871	as a means of mental toughness
146.871	training in the last few years.
150.679	You might not think
150.679	of the Founding Fathers --
154.285	Thomas Jefferson, John Adams,
154.285	George Washington
157.447	to name but three students of stoicism.
160.263	George Washington actually had
160.263	a play about a Stoic --
164.385	"this was ""Cato, a Tragedy"" --"
166.392	performed for his troops at Valley Forge
166.392	to keep them motivated.
170.166	So why would people of action
170.166	focus so much on an ancient philosophy?
174.27	This seems very academic.
176.615	I would encourage you to think
176.615	about stoicism a little bit differently,
180.052	as an operating system for thriving
180.052	in high-stress environments,
183.339	for making better decisions.
185.459	And it all started here,
187.993	kind of,
189.18	on a porch.
190.65	So around 300 BC in Athens,
193.931	someone named Zeno of Citium
193.931	taught many lectures
196.828	"walking around a painted porch, a ""stoa."""
199.604	"That later became ""stoicism."""
202.221	And in the Greco-Roman world,
204.641	people used stoicism
204.641	as a comprehensive system
207.427	for doing many, many things.
209.36	But for our purposes, chief among them
209.36	was training yourself
213.573	to separate what you can control
213.573	from what you cannot control,
217.044	and then doing exercises
217.044	to focus exclusively
220.126	on the former.
221.301	This decreases emotional reactivity,
223.703	which can be a superpower.
225.983	Conversely, let's say
225.983	you're a quarterback.
228.868	You miss a pass.
228.868	You get furious with yourself.
231.084	That could cost you a game.
233.098	If you're a CEO, and you fly
233.098	off the handle at a very valued employee
237.032	because of a minor infraction,
238.556	that could cost you the employee.
241.401	If you're a college student
241.401	who, say, is in a downward spiral,
246.758	and you feel helpless and hopeless,
248.937	unabated, that could cost you your life.
250.938	So the stakes are very, very high.
254.078	And there are many tools
254.078	in the toolkit to get you there.
257.239	I'm going to focus on one
257.239	that completely changed my life in 2004.
261.808	It found me then because of two things:
264.463	a very close friend, young guy, my age,
264.463	died of pancreatic cancer unexpectedly,
269.852	and then my girlfriend, who I thought
269.852	I was going to marry, walked out.
273.704	She'd had enough, and she didn't
273.704	give me a Dear John letter,
277.773	but she did give me this,
280.148	a Dear John plaque.
281.484	(Laughter)
282.556	I'm not making this up. I've kept it.
284.365	"""Business hours are over at five o'clock."""
287.026	She gave this to me
287.026	to put on my desk for personal health,
289.816	because at the time, I was working
289.816	on my first real business.
293.109	I had no idea what I was doing.
293.109	I was working 14-plus hour days,
296.252	seven days a week.
298.118	I was using stimulants to get going.
300.436	I was using depressants
300.436	to wind down and go to sleep.
303.041	It was a disaster.
304.256	I felt completely trapped.
306.465	I bought a book on simplicity
306.465	to try to find answers.
310.556	And I did find a quote
310.556	that made a big difference in my life,
314.409	"which was, ""We suffer more often"
314.409	"in imagination than in reality,"""
319.58	by Seneca the Younger,
321.388	who was a famous Stoic writer.
323.035	That took me to his letters,
324.875	which took me to the exercise,
327.352	"""premeditatio malorum,"""
329.879	which means the pre-meditation of evils.
332.199	In simple terms,
333.379	this is visualizing the worst-case
333.379	scenarios, in detail, that you fear,
338.522	preventing you from taking action,
340.263	so that you can take action
340.263	to overcome that paralysis.
343.027	My problem was monkey mind --
343.027	super loud, very incessant.
346.94	Just thinking my way
346.94	through problems doesn't work.
349.553	I needed to capture my thoughts on paper.
351.602	So I created a written exercise
353.593	"that I called ""fear-setting,"""
353.593	like goal-setting,
355.999	for myself.
357.192	It consists of three pages.
359.728	Super simple.
361.407	The first page is right here.
363.641	"""What if I ...?"""
365.841	This is whatever you fear,
367.422	whatever is causing you anxiety,
369.529	whatever you're putting off.
370.914	It could be asking someone out,
372.425	ending a relationship,
374.073	asking for a promotion,
374.073	quitting a job, starting a company.
377.135	It could be anything.
378.316	For me, it was taking
378.316	my first vacation in four years
381.372	and stepping away from my business
381.372	for a month to go to London,
384.403	where I could stay
384.403	in a friend's room for free,
387.471	to either remove myself
387.471	as a bottleneck in the business
390.201	or shut it down.
392.345	"In the first column, ""Define,"""
394.327	you're writing down all of the worst
394.327	things you can imagine happening
397.855	if you take that step.
399.43	You want 10 to 20.
401.016	I won't go through all of them,
401.016	but I'll give you two examples.
404.06	One was, I'll go to London,
404.06	it'll be rainy, I'll get depressed,
407.8	the whole thing will be
407.8	a huge waste of time.
410.047	Number two, I'll miss
410.047	a letter from the IRS,
412.875	and I'll get audited
414.414	or raided or shut down or some such.
417.405	"And then you go to the ""Prevent"" column."
419.403	In that column, you write
419.403	down the answer to:
421.577	What could I do to prevent
421.577	each of these bullets from happening,
424.696	or, at the very least, decrease
424.696	the likelihood even a little bit?
428.649	So for getting depressed in London,
431.068	I could take a portable blue light with me
433.106	and use it for 15 minutes in the morning.
435.125	I knew that helped stave off
435.125	depressive episodes.
437.804	For the IRS bit, I could change
437.804	the mailing address on file with the IRS
441.699	so the paperwork would go to my accountant
443.79	instead of to my UPS address.
445.767	Easy-peasy.
447.24	"Then we go to ""Repair."""
450.058	So if the worst-case scenarios happen,
452.552	what could you do to repair
452.552	the damage even a little bit,
455.542	or who could you ask for help?
458.251	So in the first case, London,
459.764	well, I could fork over some money,
459.764	fly to Spain, get some sun --
463.463	undo the damage, if I got into a funk.
466.134	In the case of missing
466.134	a letter from the IRS,
468.567	I could call a friend who is a lawyer
471.032	or ask, say, a professor of law
474.597	what they would recommend,
475.922	who I should talk to,
475.922	how had people handled this in the past.
479.142	So one question to keep in mind
479.142	as you're doing this first page is:
483.203	Has anyone else in the history of time
485.384	less intelligent or less driven
487.515	figured this out?
489.203	"Chances are, the answer is ""Yes."""
491.523	(Laughter)
492.549	The second page is simple:
496.073	What might be the benefits
496.073	of an attempt or a partial success?
499.518	You can see we're playing up the fears
501.353	and really taking a conservative
501.353	look at the upside.
504.744	So if you attempted whatever
504.744	you're considering,
507.134	might you build confidence,
507.134	develop skills,
509.342	emotionally, financially, otherwise?
512.148	What might be the benefits
512.148	of, say, a base hit?
514.911	Spend 10 to 15 minutes on this.
517.002	Page three.
518.572	This might be the most important,
518.572	so don't skip it:
521.008	"""The Cost of Inaction."""
522.582	Humans are very good at considering
522.582	what might go wrong
525.514	if we try something new,
525.514	say, ask for a raise.
528.927	What we don't often consider
528.927	is the atrocious cost of the status quo --
534.549	not changing anything.
536.779	So you should ask yourself,
538.654	if I avoid this action or decision
542.862	and actions and decisions like it,
545.409	what might my life look like in,
545.409	say, six months, 12 months, three years?
550.19	Any further out, it starts
550.19	to seem intangible.
552.702	And really get detailed --
552.702	again, emotionally, financially,
556.573	physically, whatever.
558.391	And when I did this, it painted
558.391	a terrifying picture.
561.118	I was self-medicating,
563.237	my business was going to implode
563.237	at any moment at all times,
567.022	if I didn't step away.
568.211	My relationships were fraying or failing.
570.768	And I realized that inaction
570.768	was no longer an option for me.
575.951	Those are the three pages. That's it.
575.951	That's fear-setting.
578.766	And after this, I realized
578.766	that on a scale of one to 10,
582.381	one being minimal impact,
585.972	if I took the trip, I was risking
587.638	a one to three of temporary
587.638	and reversible pain
590.996	for an eight to 10 of positive,
590.996	life-changing impact
595.031	that could be a semi-permanent.
597.209	So I took the trip.
599.007	None of the disasters came to pass.
600.806	There were some hiccups, sure.
602.325	I was able to extricate myself
602.325	from the business.
604.891	I ended up extending that trip
604.891	for a year and a half around the world,
608.773	and that became the basis
608.773	for my first book,
611.003	that leads me here today.
612.504	And I can trace all of my biggest wins
615.86	and all of my biggest disasters averted
618.787	back to doing fear-setting
620.693	at least once a quarter.
623.06	It's not a panacea.
624.253	You'll find that some of your fears
624.253	are very well-founded.
627.167	(Laughter)
628.246	But you shouldn't conclude that
629.921	without first putting them
629.921	under a microscope.
633.144	And it doesn't make all the hard times,
633.144	the hard choices, easy,
636.377	but it can make a lot of them easier.
639.005	I'd like to close with a profile
639.005	of one of my favorite modern-day Stoics.
643.961	This is Jerzy Gregorek.
646.622	He is a four-time world champion
646.622	in Olympic weightlifting,
650.075	political refugee,
651.473	published poet,
654.779	He can still kick my ass and probably
654.779	most asses in this room.
659.257	He's an impressive guy.
660.483	I spent a lot of time
660.483	on his stoa, his porch,
662.771	asking life and training advice.
665.988	He was part of the Solidarity in Poland,
669.196	which was a nonviolent
669.196	movement for social change
671.886	that was violently suppressed
671.886	by the government.
674.687	He lost his career as a firefighter.
676.757	Then his mentor, a priest,
676.757	was kidnapped, tortured, killed
679.902	and thrown into a river.
681.56	He was then threatened.
682.798	He and his wife had to flee Poland,
682.798	bounce from country to country
685.98	until they landed in the US
685.98	with next to nothing,
688.458	sleeping on floors.
690.495	He now lives in Woodside, California,
690.495	in a very nice place,
694.306	and of the 10,000-plus people
694.306	I've met in my life,
696.955	I would put him in the top 10,
699.263	in terms of success and happiness.
702.391	And there's a punchline coming,
702.391	so pay attention.
704.742	I sent him a text a few weeks ago,
706.629	asking him: Had he ever read
706.629	any Stoic philosophy?
709.448	And he replied with two pages of text.
711.87	This is very unlike him.
711.87	He is a terse dude.
714.139	(Laughter)
715.655	And not only was he familiar
715.655	with stoicism,
718.74	but he pointed out, for all
718.74	of his most important decisions,
722.158	his inflection points,
723.689	when he stood up
723.689	for his principles and ethics,
727.962	how he had used stoicism
727.962	and something akin to fear-setting,
731.088	which blew my mind.
732.274	And he closed with two things.
733.945	Number one: he couldn't imagine
733.945	any life more beautiful
737.696	than that of a Stoic.
740.633	And the last was his mantra,
740.633	which he applies to everything,
743.585	and you can apply to everything:
747.224	"""Easy choices, hard life."
749.877	"Hard choices, easy life."""
754.092	The hard choices --
756.093	what we most fear doing, asking, saying --
760.841	these are very often exactly
760.841	what we most need to do.
765.788	And the biggest challenges
765.788	and problems we face
768.301	will never be solved
768.301	with comfortable conversations,
771.42	whether it's in your own head
771.42	or with other people.
775.184	So I encourage you to ask yourselves:
777.013	Where in your lives right now
778.952	might defining your fears be more
778.952	important than defining your goals?
784.786	Keeping in mind all the while,
784.786	the words of Seneca:
788.015	"""We suffer more often"
788.015	"in imagination than in reality."""
791.988	Thank you very much.
793.184	(Applause)
