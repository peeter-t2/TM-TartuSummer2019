16.26	I woke up in the middle of the night
18.26	with the sound of heavy explosion.
21.26	It was deep at night.
23.26	I do not remember what time it was.
25.26	I just remember the sound
27.26	was so heavy
29.26	and so very shocking.
32.26	Everything in my room was shaking --
35.26	my heart, my windows,
38.26	my bed, everything.
42.26	I looked out the windows
45.26	and I saw a full half-circle
48.26	of explosion.
50.26	I thought it was just like the movies,
52.26	but the movies had not conveyed them
54.26	in the powerful image that I was seeing
57.26	full of bright red
59.26	and orange and gray,
61.26	and a full circle of explosion.
63.26	And I kept on staring at it
66.26	until it disappeared.
69.26	I went back to my bed,
72.26	and I prayed,
74.26	and I secretly thanked God
77.26	that that missile
79.26	did not land on my family's home,
83.26	that it did not kill my family that night.
88.26	Thirty years have passed,
90.26	and I still feel guilty about that prayer,
94.26	for the next day, I learned that that missile
96.26	landed on my brother's friend's home
100.26	and killed him
103.26	and his father,
105.26	but did not kill his mother or his sister.
111.26	His mother showed up the next week
113.26	at my brother's classroom
115.26	and begged seven-year-old kids
118.26	to share with her any picture they may have
121.26	of her son,
123.26	for she had lost everything.
129.26	This is not a story
131.26	of a nameless survivor of war,
135.26	and nameless refugees,
137.26	whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers
140.26	and our TV
143.26	with tattered clothes,
145.26	dirty face, scared eyes.
149.26	This is not a story of a nameless someone
152.26	who lived in some war,
154.26	who we do not know their hopes, their dreams,
156.26	their accomplishments, their families,
159.26	their beliefs, their values.
161.26	This is my story.
165.26	I was that girl.
169.26	I am another image and vision
172.26	of another survivor of war.
175.26	I am that refugee,
177.26	and I am that girl.
180.26	You see,
182.26	I grew up in war-torn Iraq,
186.26	and I believe that there are two sides of wars
189.26	and we've only seen
191.26	one side of it.
193.26	We only talk about
195.26	one side of it.
197.26	But there's another side
199.26	that I have witnessed
201.26	as someone who lived in it
203.26	and someone who ended up working in it.
206.26	I grew up with the colors of war --
209.26	the red colors of fire and blood,
212.26	the brown tones of earth
215.26	as it explodes
217.26	in our faces
219.26	and the piercing silver
221.26	of an exploded missile,
223.26	so bright
225.26	that nothing can protect your eyes from it.
229.26	I grew up
231.26	with the sounds of war --
233.26	the staccato sounds of gunfire,
236.26	the wrenching booms of explosions,
239.26	ominous drones of jets flying overhead
242.26	and the wailing warning sounds
244.26	of sirens.
247.26	These are the sounds you would expect,
250.26	but they are also the sounds
252.26	of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds
255.26	screeching in the night,
257.26	the high-pitched honest cries
259.26	of children
261.26	and the thunderous,
263.26	unbearable
265.26	silence.
268.26	"""War,"" a friend of mine said,"
270.26	"""is not about sound at all."
273.26	It is actually about silence,
276.26	"the silence of humanity."""
281.26	I have since left Iraq
284.26	and founded a group called Women for Women International
287.26	that ends up working
289.26	with women survivors of wars.
292.26	In my travels and in my work,
294.26	from Congo to Afghanistan,
297.26	from Sudan to Rwanda,
299.26	I have learned not only
301.26	that the colors and the sounds of war are the same,
304.26	but the fears of war are the same.
308.26	You know, there is a fear of dying,
310.26	and do not believe any movie character
313.26	where the hero is not afraid.
315.26	It is very scary
317.26	to go through that feeling
319.26	"of ""I am about to die"""
321.26	"or ""I could die in this explosion."""
324.26	But there's also the fear
326.26	of losing loved ones,
328.26	and I think that's even worse.
330.26	It's too painful. You don't want to think about it.
333.26	But I think the worst kind of fear is the fear --
337.26	as Samia, a Bosnian woman, once told me,
340.26	who survived the four-years besiege of Sarajevo;
343.26	"she said, ""The fear"
345.26	of losing
347.26	the 'I' in me,
349.26	the fear of losing
352.26	"the 'I' in me."""
354.26	That's what my mother in Iraq
356.26	used to tell me.
358.26	It's like dying from inside-out.
362.26	A Palestinian woman once told me,
364.26	"""It is not about the fear of one death,"""
367.26	"she said, ""sometimes I feel"
369.26	"I die 10 times in one day,"""
372.26	as she was describing the marches of soldiers
374.26	and the sounds of their bullets.
376.26	"She said, ""But it's not fair,"
378.26	because there is only one life,
381.26	"and there should only be one death."""
387.26	We have been only seeing
390.26	one side of war.
392.26	We have only been discussing and consumed
395.26	with high-level preoccupations
397.26	over troop levels, drawdown timelines,
400.26	surges and sting operations,
402.26	when we should be examining the details
405.26	of where the social fabric
408.26	has been most torn,
411.26	where the community has improvised
413.26	and survived
415.26	and shown acts of resilience
417.26	and amazing courage
419.26	just to keep life going.
423.26	We have been so consumed
426.26	with seemingly objective discussions
428.26	of politics, tactics,
430.26	weapons, dollars
432.26	and casualties.
434.26	This is the language
436.26	of sterility.
439.26	How casually
441.26	we treat casualties
443.26	in the context of this topic.
445.26	This is where we conceive of rape and casualties
448.26	as inevitabilities.
451.26	Eighty percent of refugees around the world
454.26	are women and children. Oh.
457.26	Ninety percent of modern war casualties
459.26	are civilians.
461.26	Seventy-five percent of them are women and children.
464.26	How interesting.
467.26	Oh, half a million women in Rwanda
469.26	get raped in 100 days.
471.26	Or, as we speak now,
474.26	hundreds of thousands of Congolese women
477.26	are getting raped and mutilated.
479.26	How interesting.
481.26	These just become numbers that we refer to.
485.26	The front of wars
487.26	is increasingly non-human eyes
490.26	peering down on our perceived enemies
492.26	from space,
494.26	guiding missiles toward unseen targets,
497.26	while the human conduct
499.26	of the orchestra of media relations
501.26	in the event that this particular drone attack
504.26	hits a villager
506.26	instead of an extremist.
508.26	It is a chess game.
510.26	You learn to play an international relations school
513.26	on your way out and up
515.26	to national and international leadership.
518.26	Checkmate.
521.26	We are missing
523.26	a completely other side of wars.
527.26	We are missing my mother's story,
530.26	who made sure with every siren, with every raid,
533.26	with every cut off-of electricity,
535.26	she played puppet shows for my brothers and I,
537.26	so we would not be scared
539.26	of the sounds of explosions.
541.26	We are missing the story of Fareeda,
544.26	a music teacher,
546.26	a piano teacher, in Sarajevo,
548.26	who made sure
550.26	that she kept the music school open
552.26	every single day
554.26	in the four years of besiege in Sarajevo
557.26	and walked to that school,
559.26	despite the snipers shooting
561.26	at that school and at her,
563.26	and kept the piano, the violin, the cello
566.26	playing the whole duration of the war,
569.26	with students wearing their gloves and hats and coats.
572.26	That was her fight.
574.26	That was her resistance.
577.26	We are missing the story of Nehia,
580.26	a Palestinian woman in Gaza
582.26	who, the minute there was a cease-fire in the last year's war,
585.26	she left out of home,
587.26	collected all the flour
589.26	and baked as much bread for every neighbor to have,
592.26	in case there is no cease-fire the day after.
596.26	We are missing
598.26	the stories of Violet,
600.26	who, despite surviving genocide in the church massacre,
603.26	she kept on going on,
605.26	burying bodies, cleaning homes, cleaning the streets.
608.26	We are missing stories of women
611.26	who are literally keeping life going
614.26	in the midst of wars.
616.26	Do you know --
618.26	do you know that people fall in love in war
621.26	and go to school
624.26	and go to factories and hospitals
626.26	and get divorced and go dancing and go playing
628.26	and live life going?
632.26	And the ones who are keeping that life
634.26	are women.
637.26	There are two sides of war.
641.26	There is a side that fights,
643.26	and there is a side that keeps the schools
645.26	and the factories and the hospitals open.
648.26	There is a side that is focused on winning battles,
651.26	and there is a side that is focused
653.26	on winning life.
656.26	There is a side that leads the front-line discussion,
659.26	and there is a side
661.26	that leads the back-line discussion.
664.26	There is a side that thinks
666.26	that peace is the end of fighting,
670.26	and there is a side that thinks
672.26	that peace is the arrival
674.26	of schools and jobs.
677.26	There is a side
679.26	that is led by men,
681.26	and there is a side
683.26	that is led by women.
685.26	And in order for us to understand
688.26	how do we build lasting peace,
691.26	we must understand war and peace
694.26	from both sides.
696.26	We must have a full picture
698.26	of what that means.
700.26	In order for us to understand
702.26	what actually peace means,
704.26	we need to understand,
706.26	as one Sudanese woman once told me,
708.26	"""Peace is the fact that my toenails"
711.26	"are growing back again."""
714.26	She grew up in Sudan, in Southern Sudan,
716.26	for 20 years of war,
718.26	where it killed one million people
721.26	and displaced five million refugees.
724.26	Many women were taken as slaves
726.26	by rebels and soldiers,
728.26	as sexual slaves who were forced also
731.26	to carry the ammunition and the water
733.26	and the food for the soldiers.
735.26	So that woman walked for 20 years,
738.26	so she would not be kidnapped again.
741.26	And only when there was some sort of peace,
744.26	her toenails grew back again.
748.26	We need to understand peace
750.26	from a toenail's perspective.
754.26	We need to understand
756.26	that we cannot actually have negotiations
758.26	of ending of wars or peace
760.26	without fully including women
763.26	at the negotiating table.
765.26	I find it amazing
767.26	that the only group of people
769.26	who are not fighting and not killing
771.26	and not pillaging and not burning and not raping,
774.26	and the group of people who are mostly --
776.26	though not exclusively --
778.26	who are keeping life going in the midst of war,
781.26	are not included in the negotiating table.
786.26	And I do argue that women lead the back-line discussion,
789.26	but there are also men
791.26	who are excluded from that discussion.
793.26	The doctors who are not fighting,
795.26	the artists, the students, the men who refuse to pick up the guns,
798.26	they are, too, excluded
800.26	from the negotiating tables.
803.26	There is no way we can talk about a lasting peace,
806.26	building of democracy, sustainable economies,
809.26	any kind of stabilities,
811.26	if we do not fully include women
814.26	at the negotiating table.
816.26	Not one, but 50 percent.
820.26	There is no way we can talk about the building of stability
823.26	if we don't start investing
826.26	in women and girls.
828.26	Did you know
830.26	that one year
832.26	of the world's military spending
834.26	equals 700 years
837.26	of the U.N. budget
840.26	and equals 2,928 years
843.26	of the U.N. budget allocated for women?
847.26	If we just reverse
849.26	that distribution of funds,
851.26	perhaps we could have
854.26	a better lasting peace in this world.
857.26	And last, but not least,
859.26	we need to invest in peace and women,
862.26	not only because it is the right thing to do,
865.26	not only because it is the right thing to do,
868.26	for all of us to build sustainable and lasting peace today,
871.26	but it is for the future.
874.26	A Congolese woman,
876.26	who was telling me about
878.26	how her children saw their father killed in front of them
881.26	and saw her raped in front of them
884.26	and mutilated in front of them,
886.26	and her children saw their nine-year-old sibling
888.26	killed in front of them,
891.26	how they're doing okay right now.
894.26	She got into Women for Women International's program.
896.26	She got a support network.
898.26	She learned about her rights.
900.26	We taught her vocational and business skills. We helped her get a job.
903.26	She was earning 450 dollars. She was doing okay.
906.26	She was sending them to school. Have a new home.
908.26	"She said, ""But what I worry about the most"
911.26	is not any of that.
913.26	I worry that my children
915.26	have hate in their hearts,
918.26	and when they want to grow up, they want to fight again
921.26	"the killers of their father and their brother."""
925.26	We need to invest in women,
928.26	because that's our only chance
931.26	to ensure that there is no more war
933.26	in the future.
935.26	That mother has a better chance to heal her children
938.26	than any peace agreement can do.
942.26	Are there good news? Of course, there are good news. There are lots of good news.
945.26	To start with, these women that I told you about
948.26	are dancing and singing every single day,
951.26	and if they can,
953.26	who are we not to dance?
955.26	That girl that I told you about
957.26	ended up starting Women for Women International Group
960.26	that impacted one million people, sent 80 million dollars,
963.26	and I started this from zero,
965.26	nothing, nada, [unclear].
968.26	(Laughter)
971.26	They are women who are standing on their feet
974.26	in spite of their circumstances,
977.26	not because of it.
980.26	Think of how the world can be a much better place
983.26	if, for a change,
985.26	we have a better equality,
987.26	we have equality,
989.26	we have a representation
991.26	and we understand war,
993.26	both from the front-line
995.26	and the back-line discussion.
997.26	Rumi, a 13th-century Sufi poet,
1000.26	"says, ""Out beyond the worlds"
1002.26	of right-doings and wrong-doings,
1005.26	there is a field.
1007.26	I will meet you there.
1009.26	When the soul lies down in that grass,
1012.26	the world is too full
1014.26	to talk about.
1016.26	Ideas, language,
1018.26	even the phrase 'each other'
1020.26	"no longer makes any sense."""
1024.26	I humbly add -- humbly add --
1027.26	that out beyond
1029.26	the worlds of war and peace,
1032.26	there is a field,
1034.26	and there are many women and men
1037.26	[who] are meeting there.
1040.26	Let us make this field a much bigger place.
1043.26	Let us all meet in that field.
1046.26	Thank you.
1048.26	(Applause)
