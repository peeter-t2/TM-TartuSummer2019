12.962	It's Christmas Eve, 1968.
17.34	The Apollo 8 spacecraft
17.34	has successfully completed
20.78	its first three orbits around the moon.
24.78	Launched from Cape Canaveral
24.78	three days before,
27.5	this is the first time
29.22	that humans have ever traveled
29.22	beyond low Earth orbit.
34.26	On the vessel's fourth pass,
36.3	the Earth slowly comes into view
39.02	and reveals itself
39.02	above the Moon's horizon.
43.5	Astronaut Bill Anders frantically
43.5	asks his crewmates where their camera is,
47.46	grabs the Hasselblad,
47.46	points it towards the window,
49.9	presses the shutter,
51.26	and takes one of the most
51.26	important photographs of all time:
56.38	"""Earthrise."""
58.54	When the crew was safely home
58.54	a few days later,
61.22	they were asked about the mission.
63.78	Anders famously replied,
66.06	"""We went to the moon,"
68.18	"but we actually discovered Earth."""
73.3	What did he and his fellow crewmates feel
77.62	in this incredible moment?
79.66	In a study released just this past year,
82.22	a team of researchers
82.22	at the University of Pennsylvania
85.3	examined the testimonies
85.3	of hundreds of astronauts
88.94	who had the opportunity
88.94	to view the Earth from space.
92.22	Their analysis uncovered
92.22	three common feelings:
96.02	first, a greater appreciation
96.02	for Earth's beauty;
99.82	second, an increased sense
99.82	of connection to all other living beings;
104.94	and third, an unexpected,
104.94	often overwhelming sense of emotion.
110.98	The researchers believe that seeing
110.98	the Earth from a great distance
114.46	provokes someone to develop
114.46	new cognitive frameworks
118.42	to understand what they are seeing.
121.06	They believe these astronauts
121.06	were forever changed
124.06	by this new view,
125.94	this new perspective,
127.86	this new visual truth.
131.18	This feeling is commonly referred to
131.18	"as the ""overview effect."""
136.94	Only 558 people
136.94	have ever been to outer space.
145.18	to gaze down in awe,
148.34	to wonder at our planet
150.02	floating in an infinite sea of darkness.
153.66	But what if that number were bigger?
156.46	Three years ago,
156.46	I set off on my own mission:
159.98	to see if I could bring this feeling
159.98	of overwhelming scale and beauty
164.74	to many more people
166.42	just by using one small computer
168.5	in my small New York City apartment.
171.3	It was then, in 2013,
171.3	"that I launched ""Daily Overview."""
175.34	Every day, I have used satellite imagery
178.9	to create one expansive
178.9	overhead view of our planet.
183.3	More than 1,000 of these images
183.3	have been created thus far,
188.26	and more than 600,000 people
190.78	tune in for this daily dose
190.78	of perspectives.
193.86	I create the imagery by curating photos
193.86	from the massive archive
198.98	of a satellite company
198.98	called Digital Globe.
201.9	They operate a constellation
201.9	of five satellites,
204.7	each roughly the size of an ambulance,
207.34	that is constantly
207.34	taking pictures of the Earth
209.78	as they orbit at
215.1	Now, what does this mean?
217.42	Each of these satellites
217.42	is equipped with a camera
219.82	that has a focal length of 16 meters,
222.74	so that's roughly 290 times greater
226.46	than a DSLR camera equipped
226.46	with a standard 55 millimeter lens.
231.62	So if were able to attach
231.62	one of their satellites
234.1	to the roof of this theater in Oxford,
237.02	we could take a picture of a football,
239.82	clearly, on the pitch
239.82	at the stadium in Amsterdam.
244.86	That's 450 kilometers away.
248.38	That's incredibly powerful technology.
251.34	And I decided at the beginning
251.34	of this project
253.86	that I would use
253.86	that incredible technology
256.34	to focus on the places
258.26	where humans have impacted the planet.
261.94	As a species, we dig and scrape
261.94	the Earth for resources,
266.34	we produce energy,
268.5	we raise animals
268.5	and cultivate crops for food,
272.7	we build cities, we move around,
275.18	we create waste.
276.54	And in the process
276.54	of doing all of these things,
279.86	we shape landscapes and seascapes
282.98	and cityscapes with increasing
282.98	control and impunity.
288.46	So with that in mind,
289.74	I would like to share
289.74	a few of my overviews with you now.
293.5	Here we see cargo ships and oil tankers
297.02	waiting outside the entry
297.02	to the port of Singapore.
300.7	This facility is the second-busiest
300.7	in the world by terms of total tonnage,
305.66	accounting for one-fifth
305.66	of the world's shipping containers
309.06	and one half of the annual supply
311.54	of crude oil.
313.62	If you look closely at this overview,
313.62	you'll see a lot of little specks.
317.54	Those are actually cows at a feedlot
320.42	in Summerfield, Texas,
320.42	in the United States.
323.9	So once cows reach a particular weight,
326.14	roughly 300 kilograms,
328.3	they are moved here
328.3	and placed on a specialized diet.
331.78	Over the next three to four months,
331.78	the cows gain an additional 180 kilograms
336.94	before they are shipped off to slaughter.
339.1	You're also probably wondering
339.1	about this glowing pool at the top there.
342.54	That gets its color from a unique
342.54	combination of manure, chemicals
346.42	and a particular type of algae
346.42	that grows in the stagnant water.
350.98	This is the Mount Whaleback iron ore mine
353.82	in the Pilbara region
353.82	of Western Australia,
357.14	a beautiful yet scary scar
357.14	on the face of the Earth.
360.98	Of the world's mined iron ore,
366.02	and is therefore a major component
366.02	in the construction of buildings,
369.34	automobiles or appliances
369.34	such as your dishwasher or refrigerator.
375.06	This is a solar concentrator
375.06	in Seville, Spain.
378.7	So this facility contains 2,650 mirrors
383.42	which are arrayed in concentric circles
383.42	around an 140-meter-tall tower
388.5	at its center.
390.3	At the top of the tower,
391.78	there is a capsule of molten salt
394.02	that gets heated by the beams
394.02	of light reflected upwards
397.66	from the mirrors below.
399.62	From there, the salt circulates
399.62	to a storage tank underground,
403.1	where it produces steam,
404.58	which spins turbines
406.06	and generates enough electricity
406.06	to power 70,000 homes
409.58	and offsets 30,000 tons
409.58	of carbon dioxide emissions every year.
415.02	This overview shows deforestation
415.02	in Santa Cruz, Bolivia
419.06	immediately adjacent
419.06	to untouched tracts of rainforest.
424.032	Deforestation in the country
424.032	has primarily been driven
426.58	by the expansion of mechanized agriculture
429.22	and cattle ranching,
430.9	so as the country tries to meet
430.9	the demand of its growing population
434.14	and feed them,
435.38	the sacrificial destruction
435.38	of its rainforest
437.7	has taken place to do so.
439.98	It is estimated that the country
439.98	lost 4.5 million acres of rainforest
444.98	in one decade alone
446.46	from 2000 until 2010.
449.74	This is the Eixample district
449.74	in Barcelona, Spain.
453.46	So the overview perspective
453.46	can be incredibly helpful
456.26	to help us understand how cities function
458.3	and how we can devise
458.3	smarter solutions for urban planning,
461.26	and this will become only more relevant
463.42	as it is expected that 4.9 billion people
463.42	will live in cities around the world
468.94	by the year 2030.
471.06	This area of Barcelona is characterized
471.06	by its strict grid pattern,
475.3	apartments with communal courtyards
477.34	and these octagonal intersections
479.54	which allow for more sunlight,
479.54	better ventilation
482.58	and additional parking at street level.
485.3	And here we see that grid pattern
485.3	but under much different circumstances.
490.3	This is the Dadaab Refugee Camp
490.3	in northern Kenya,
493.82	the largest such facility
493.82	of its kind in the world.
496.78	To cope with the influx of refugees
496.78	who are fleeing Somalia,
500.06	where there is famine and conflict,
501.98	the UN has built this area
501.98	gridded out at left
504.5	called the LFO extension
506.26	to house more and more refugees
507.82	who are arriving and occupying
507.82	these white dots,
510.82	which are actually tents
512.18	which will slowly fill up
512.18	the area over time.
515.3	So if you have one of these overviews,
518.42	you have a moment in time.
521.1	If we have two overviews, however,
522.98	we are able to tell stories
522.98	about changes in time.
526.58	I call that feature
526.58	"of the project ""Juxtapose,"""
528.94	and we'll share a few examples
528.94	of it with you now.
532.06	So the tulip fields in Netherlands
532.06	bloom every year in April.
536.94	So we take an image
536.94	captured in March a few weeks before
540.1	and contrast it to one
540.1	taken a few weeks later.
543.38	We're able to watch the flowers bloom
543.38	in this magnificent cascade of color.
548.86	It is estimated that the Dutch produce
548.86	4.3 billion tulip bulbs every year.
555.98	In 2015, two dams collapsed
559.1	at an iron ore mine
559.1	in southeastern Brazil,
561.82	causing one of the worst
561.82	environmental disasters
564.46	in the history of the country.
566.3	It is estimated that 62 million
566.3	cubic meters of waste
570.22	were released when the dams broke,
571.94	destroying numerous villages
571.94	in the process,
574.38	including Bento Rodrigues,
574.38	seen here before ...
579.94	and after the flood.
583.1	Ultimately, 19 people
583.1	were killed in this disaster.
586.66	Half a million people did not
586.66	have access to clean drinking water
589.78	for an extended period of time,
591.82	and the waste soon entered
591.82	into the Doce River,
594.3	extended for 650 kilometers
596.82	all the way into the sea,
598.5	killing unknowable amounts
598.5	of plant and animal life along the way.
603.26	And lastly, here is a story
603.26	related to the crisis in Syria,
607.06	a conflict which has claimed the lives
607.06	of hundreds of thousands of people
610.94	and displaced millions.
612.86	So this patch of desert
612.86	is seen in Mafraq, Jordan in 2011,
617.38	the year the conflict started,
619.1	and when we compare it to an image
619.1	captured just this year in 2017,
624.54	we see the construction
624.54	of the Zaatari refugee camp.
627.86	So just as the astronauts of Apollo 8
631.54	watched the Earth rising above
631.54	the lunar landscape for the first time,
635.5	there is no way
635.5	that you could have imagined
637.7	what the places I just showed you
637.7	look like from outer space.
642.54	And while you may enjoy
642.54	the aesthetics of an image,
645.26	once you learn exactly
645.26	what it is you're seeing,
647.54	you may struggle with the fact
647.54	that you still like it.
651.3	And that's the tension
651.3	I want to create with my work,
654.14	because I believe
654.14	it is that contemplation,
657.3	that internal dialogue
659.26	that will lead to greater
659.26	interest in our planet
661.7	and more awareness
661.7	of what we're doing to it.
664.78	I believe that viewing the Earth
664.78	from the overview perspective
667.74	is more important now than ever before.
671.26	Through the incredible technology
671.26	of these high-flying cameras,
674.62	we can see, monitor and expose
677.82	the unprecedented impact
677.82	that we are having.
681.18	And whether we are scientists
683.22	or engineers or policymakers
686.26	or investors or artists,
689.22	if we can adopt
689.22	a more expansive perspective,
692.7	embrace the truth of what is going on
696.02	and contemplate the long-term
696.02	health of our planet,
700.18	we will create a better
702.18	and safer and smarter future
704.98	for our one and only home.
707.14	Thank you.
708.38	(Applause)
