12.817	I'm assuming everyone here has watched
14.177	a TED Talk online at one time or another, right?
18.541	So what I'm going to do is play this.
20.643	This is the song from the TED Talks online.
23.494	(Music)
30.249	And I'm going to slow it down
31.54	because things sound cooler when they're slower.
34.321	(Music)
78.683	Ken Robinson: Good morning. How are you?
82.348	Mark Applebaum: I'm going to --
82.348	Kate Stone: -- mix some music.
85.688	MA: I'm going to do so in a way that tells a story.
87.794	Tod Machover: Something nobody's ever heard before.
90.905	KS: I have a crossfader.
92.399	Julian Treasure: I call this the mixer.
94.048	KS: Two D.J. decks.
95.348	Chris Anderson: You turn up the 
95.348	dials, the wheel starts to turn.
102.571	Dan Ellsey: I have always loved music.
104.953	Michael Tilson Thomas: Is it a melody 
104.953	or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude?
107.468	Daniel Wolpert: Feeling everything 
107.468	that's going on inside my body.
110.124	Adam Ockelford: In your brain is 
110.124	this amazing musical computer.
116.002	MTT: Using computers and synthesizers to create 
116.002	works. It's a language that's still evolving.
127.647	And the 21st century.
130.074	KR: Turn on the radio. Pop into the discotheque.
132.712	You will know what this person 
132.712	is doing: moving to the music.
147.61	Mark Ronson: This is my favorite part.
149.982	MA: You gotta have doorstops. That's important.
154.197	TM: We all love music a great deal.
155.884	MTT: Anthems, dance crazes, ballads and marches.
159.044	Kirby Ferguson and JT: The remix: It 
159.044	is new music created from old music.
162.767	Ryan Holladay: Blend seamlessly.
165.028	Kathryn Schulz: And that's how it goes.
166.483	MTT: What happens when the music stops?
173.918	KS: Yay!
177.684	(Applause)
183.594	MR: Obviously, I've been watching a lot of TED Talks.
188.124	When I was first asked to speak at TED,
191.503	I wasn't quite sure what my angle was, at first,
193.516	so yeah, I immediately started
193.516	watching tons of TED Talks,
196.468	which is pretty much absolutely
198.484	the worst thing that you can do
200.323	because you start to go into panic mode, thinking,
203.151	I haven't mounted a successful
203.151	expedition to the North Pole yet.
206.652	Neither have I provided electricity
210.552	to my village through sheer ingenuity.
213.149	In fact, I've pretty much wasted most of my life
215.969	DJing in night clubs
217.266	and producing pop records.
219.245	But I still kept watching the videos,
221.92	because I'm a masochist,
223.551	and eventually, things like Michael Tilson Thomas
226.623	and Tod Machover, and seeing
229.439	their visceral passion talking about music,
231.606	it definitely stirred something in me,
233.433	and I'm a sucker for anyone talking devotedly
235.778	about the power of music.
237.169	And I started to write down on these little note cards
239.829	every time I heard something
241.172	that struck a chord in me, pardon the pun,
243.387	or something that I thought I could use,
245.143	and pretty soon, my studio looked like this,
249.81	"kind of like a John Nash, ""Beautiful Mind"" vibe."
253.573	The other good thing about watching TED Talks,
256.368	when you see a really good one,
258.255	you kind of all of a sudden wish the speaker
260.188	was your best friend, don't you? Like, just for a day.
263.032	They seem like a nice person.
265.027	You'd take a bike ride, maybe share an ice cream.
268.009	You'd certainly learn a lot.
270.76	And every now and then they'd chide you,
272.214	when they got frustrated that you couldn't really
273.95	keep up with half of the technical things
273.95	they're banging on about all the time.
276.879	But then they'd remember that
276.879	you're but a mere human
279.348	of ordinary, mortal intelligence
280.83	that didn't finish university,
282.229	and they'd kind of forgive you,
283.795	and pet you like the dog.
287.39	(Laughter)
289.515	Man, yeah, back to the real world,
292.253	probably Sir Ken Robinson and I
293.78	are not going to end up being best of friends.
295.484	He lives all the way in L.A.
295.484	and I imagine is quite busy,
298.917	but through the tools available to me -- technology
301.654	and the innate way that I approach making music --
303.922	I can sort of bully our existences
306.66	into a shared event,
307.971	which is sort of what you saw.
310.537	I can hear something that I love in a piece of media
313.546	and I can co-opt it
314.93	and insert myself in that narrative,
317.266	or alter it, even.
320.238	In a nutshell, that's what I was trying to do
321.968	with these things, but more importantly,
324.174	that's what the past 30 years of music has been.
326.564	That's the major thread.
328.252	See, 30 years ago, you had the first digital samplers,
330.975	and they changed everything overnight.
332.46	All of a sudden, artists could sample
334.125	from anything and everything that came before them,
336.93	from a snare drum from the Funky Meters,
339.125	to a Ron Carter bassline,
340.939	"the theme to ""The Price Is Right."""
343.01	"Albums like De La Soul's ""3 Feet High and Rising"""
345.143	"and the Beastie Boys' ""Paul's Boutique"""
347.297	looted from decades of recorded music
349.555	to create these sonic, layered masterpieces
352.604	that were basically the Sgt. Peppers of their day.
354.856	And they weren't sampling these records
357.503	because they were too lazy to write their own music.
360.312	They weren't sampling these records to cash in on
362.277	the familiarity of the original stuff.
363.946	To be honest, it was all about sampling
365.503	really obscure things,
367.044	except for a few obvious exceptions
368.532	"like Vanilla Ice and ""doo doo doo da da doo doo"""
371.361	that we know about.
372.77	But the thing is,
374.205	they were sampling those records
375.68	because they heard something in that music
377.478	that spoke to them
379.643	that they instantly wanted to inject themselves
381.641	into the narrative of that music.
383.137	They heard it, they wanted to be a part of it,
384.907	and all of a sudden they found themselves
386.501	in possession of the technology to do so,
389.16	not much unlike the way the Delta blues
391.351	struck a chord with the Stones
391.351	and the Beatles and Clapton,
394.02	and they felt the need to co-opt that music
396.31	for the tools of their day.
398.07	You know, in music we take something that we love
400.702	and we build on it.
402.12	I'd like to play a song for you.
412.068	"(Music: ""La Di Da Di"" by Doug E. Fresh &amp; Slick Rick)"
431.139	"That's ""La Di Da Di"" and it's the fifth-most sampled"
433.728	song of all time.
435.032	It's been sampled 547 times.
438.202	It was made in 1984 by these two legends of hip-hop,
441.638	Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh,
444.817	and the Ray-Ban and Jheri curl look is so strong.
448.227	I do hope that comes back soon.
450.255	Anyway, this predated the sampling era.
454.348	There were no samples in this record,
455.85	although I did look up on the Internet last night,
458.206	I mean several months ago,
460.254	"that ""La Di Da Di"" means, it's an old"
462.779	Cockney expression from the late 1800s in England,
465.819	so maybe a remix with Mrs. Patmore
467.935	"from ""Downton Abbey"" coming soon,"
469.861	or that's for another day.
473.445	Doug E. Fresh was the human beat box.
475.171	Slick Rick is the voice you hear on the record,
476.955	and because of Slick Rick's sing-songy,
480.015	super-catchy vocals, it provides endless sound bites
482.804	and samples for future pop records.
485.546	That was 1984.
486.876	This is me in 1984, in case you were wondering
489.779	how I was doing, thank you for asking.
492.31	It's Throwback Thursday already.
494.411	I was involved in a heavy love affair
496.764	with the music of Duran Duran,
498.093	as you can probably tell from my outfit.
500.164	I was in the middle.
501.818	And the simplest way that I knew
503.949	how to co-opt myself into that experience
506.53	of wanting to be in that song somehow
508.463	was to just get a band together
508.463	of fellow nine-year-olds
510.884	"and play ""Wild Boys"" at the school talent show."
513.391	So that's what we did, and long story short,
515.88	we were booed off the stage,
517.622	and if you ever have a chance to live your life
520.435	escaping hearing the sound of an auditorium
522.976	full of second- and third-graders booing,
524.529	I would highly recommend it. It's not really fun.
527.137	But it didn't really matter,
528.437	because what I wanted somehow
530.205	was to just be in the history
530.205	of that song for a minute.
532.932	I didn't care who liked it.
534.123	I just loved it, and I thought
534.123	I could put myself in there.
537.442	"Over the next 10 years, ""La Di Da Di"""
539.21	continues to be sampled by countless records,
541.155	ending up on massive hits like
541.155	"""Here Comes the Hotstepper"""
544.879	"and ""I Wanna Sex You Up."""
546.36	Snoop Doggy Dogg covers this song
548.241	"on his debut album ""Doggystyle"""
548.241	"and calls it ""Lodi Dodi."""
552.304	Copyright lawyers are having
552.304	a field day at this point.
554.712	And then you fast forward to 1997,
557.48	and the Notorious B.I.G., or Biggie,
560.334	"reinterprets ""La Di Da Di"""
563.296	"on his number one hit called ""Hypnotize,"""
566.104	which I will play a little bit of
567.626	and I will play you a little bit of the Slick Rick
569.208	to show you where they got it from.
572.277	"(Music: ""Hypnotize"" by The Notorious B.I.G.)"
599.385	So Biggie was killed
603.372	weeks before that song made it to number one,
605.376	in one of the great tragedies of the hip-hop era,
607.578	but he would have been 13 years old
609.294	and very much alive when
609.294	"""La Di Da Di"" first came out,"
611.603	and as a young boy
612.865	growing up in Brooklyn,
614.516	it's hard not to think that that song probably held
616.658	some fond memories for him.
618.089	But the way he interpreted it, as you hear,
619.875	is completely his own.
621.29	He flips it, makes it,
623.365	there's nothing pastiche whatsoever about it.
625.721	It's thoroughly modern Biggie.
628.529	I had to make that joke in this room,
630.257	because you would be the only people
630.257	that I'd ever have a chance of getting it.
633.083	And so, it's a groaner. (Laughter)
636.323	Elsewhere in the pop and rap world,
639.876	we're going a little bit sample-crazy.
641.792	We're getting away from the obscure
641.792	samples that we were doing,
644.29	and all of a sudden everyone's taking
645.626	"these massive '80s tunes like Bowie, ""Let's Dance,"""
648.437	and all these disco records,
648.437	and just rapping on them.
650.816	These records don't really age that well.
652.66	You don't hear them now, because they borrowed
654.715	from an era that was too steeped
656.309	in its own connotation.
658.257	You can't just hijack nostalgia wholesale.
662.969	It leaves the listener feeling sickly.
665.093	You have to take an element of those things
667.356	and then bring something fresh and new to it,
670.235	which was something that I learned
671.425	when I was working with the late,
673.143	amazing Amy Winehouse
674.455	"on her album ""Back to Black."""
676.696	A lot of fuss was made about the sonic of the album
679.752	that myself and Salaam Remi, the other producer,
681.781	achieved, how we captured this long-lost sound,
683.669	but without the very, very 21st-century personality
687.444	and firebrand that was Amy Winehouse
689.397	and her lyrics about rehab and Roger Moore
692.55	and even a mention of Slick Rick,
694.476	the whole thing would have run the risk
695.761	of being very pastiche, to be honest.
699.222	Imagine any other singer from that era over it
701.51	singing the same old lyrics.
704.201	It runs a risk of being completely bland.
706.338	I mean, there was no doubt that Amy
708.851	and I and Salaam all had this love
710.809	for this gospel, soul and blues and jazz
712.599	that was evident listening to
712.599	the musical arrangements.
715.818	She brought the ingredients that made it urgent
717.862	and of the time.
719.521	So if we come all the way up to the present day now,
722.558	the cultural tour de force that is Miley Cyrus,
726.07	"she reinterprets ""La Di Da Di"""
728.292	completely for her generation,
730.454	and we'll take a listen to the Slick Rick part
733.398	and then see how she sort of flipped it.
738.309	"(Music: ""La Di Da Di"" by Slick Rick &amp; Doug E. Fresh)"
751.953	"(Music: ""We Can't Stop"" by Miley Cyrus)"
757.936	So Miley Cyrus,
759.777	who wasn't even born yet
759.777	"when ""La Di Da Di"" was made,"
763.315	and neither were any of the co-writers on the song,
766.849	has found this song that somehow
768.959	etched its way into the collective
768.959	consciousness of pop music,
772.004	and now, with its timeless playfulness of the original,
775.957	has kind of translated to a whole new generation
778.38	who will probably co-opt it as their own.
782.048	Since the dawn of the sampling era,
785.25	there's been endless debate
786.771	about the validity of music that contains samples.
789.369	You know, the Grammy committee says that
790.995	if your song contains some kind of pre-written
793.653	or pre-existing music,
794.898	you're ineligible for song of the year.
796.893	Rockists, who are racist
799.17	but only about rock music,
800.92	constantly use the argument to —
805.151	That's a real word. That is a real word.
807.173	They constantly use the argument to devalue rap
809.789	and modern pop,
811.699	and these arguments completely miss the point,
815.861	because the dam has burst.
817.82	We live in the post-sampling era.
819.853	We take the things that we love
821.48	and we build on them.
822.858	That's just how it goes.
824.498	And when we really add
824.498	something significant and original
827.59	and we merge our musical journey with this,
830.087	then we have a chance to be
831.925	a part of the evolution of that music that we love
834.558	and be linked with it once it
834.558	becomes something new again.
837.799	So I would like to do one more piece
843.163	that I put together for you tonight,
844.881	and it takes place with two
847.236	pretty inspiring TED performances that I've seen.
850.272	One of them is the piano player Derek Paravicini,
853.907	who happens to be a blind,
855.989	autistic genius at the piano,
857.527	and Emmanuel Jal, who is an ex-child soldier
859.94	from the South Sudan,
861.26	who is a spoken word poet and rapper.
864.122	And once again I found a way to annoyingly
866.46	me-me-me myself into the musical history
868.721	of these songs,
871.235	but I can't help it,
872.343	because they're these things that I love,
874.048	and I want to mess around with them.
875.975	So I hope you enjoy this. Here we go.
879.712	Let's hear that TED sound again, right?
881.793	(Music)
1003.423	Thank you very much. Thank you.
1006.448	(Applause)
