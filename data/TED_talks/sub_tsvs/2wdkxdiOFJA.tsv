25	I am a vicar in the Church of England.
27	I've been a priest in the Church for 20 years.
33	For most of that time, I've been struggling and grappling
37	with questions about the nature of God. Who is God?
43	"And I'm very aware that when you say the word ""God,"""
48	many people will turn off immediately.
51	And most people, both within and outside the organized church,
56	still have a picture of a celestial controller,
62	a rule maker, a policeman in the sky who orders everything,
68	and causes everything to happen.
70	He will protect his own people,
74	and answer the prayers of the faithful.
78	And in the worship of my church,
80	"the most frequently used adjective about God is ""almighty."""
86	But I have a problem with that.
89	I have become more and more uncomfortable
92	with this perception of God over the years.
96	Do we really believe that God is the kind of male boss that we've been presenting
105	in our worship and in our liturgies over all these years?
109	Of course, there have been thinkers
111	who have suggested different ways of looking at God.
117	Exploring the feminine, nurturing side of divinity.
122	Suggesting that God expresses Himself or Herself through powerlessness,
129	rather than power.
133	Acknowledging that God is unknown and unknowable by definition.
138	Finding deep resonances with other religions and philosophies
145	and ways of looking at life as part of what is a universal and global search for meaning.
153	These ideas are well known in liberal academic circles,
158	but clergy like myself have been reluctant to air them,
164	for fear of creating tension and division in our church communities,
170	for fear of upsetting the simple faith of more traditional believers.
177	I have chosen not to rock the boat.
184	Then, on December 26th last year, just two months ago,
188	that underwater earthquake triggered the tsunami.
193	And two weeks later, Sunday morning, 9th of January,
198	I found myself standing in front of my congregation --
201	intelligent, well meaning, mostly thoughtful Christian people --
207	and I needed to express, on their behalf, our feelings and our questions.
215	I had my own personal responses, but I also have a public role,
222	and something needed to be said.
224	And this is what I said.
230	Shortly after the tsunami I read a newspaper article
233	written by the Archbishop of Canterbury -- fine title --
236	about the tragedy in Southern Asia.
242	The essence of what he said was this:
245	the people most affected by the devastation and loss of life
250	do not want intellectual theories about how God let this happen.
256	"He wrote, ""If some religious genius did come up with an explanation"
262	of exactly why all these deaths made sense,
268	"would we feel happier, or safer, or more confident in God?"""
275	If the man in the photograph that appeared in the newspapers,
278	holding the hand of his dead child was standing in front of us now,
284	there are no words that we could say to him.
288	A verbal response would not be appropriate.
291	The only appropriate response would be a compassionate silence
298	and some kind of practical help.
300	It isn't a time for explanation, or preaching, or theology;
306	it's a time for tears.
310	This is true. And yet here we are, my church in Oxford,
316	semi-detached from events that happened a long way away,
321	but with our faith bruised.
324	And we want an explanation from God.
327	We demand an explanation from God.
333	Some have concluded that we can only believe in a God who shares our pain.
337	In some way, God must feel the anguish, and grief,
343	and physical pain that we feel.
345	In some way the eternal God must be able to enter into the souls of human beings
354	and experience the torment within.
358	And if this is true, it must also be that God knows the joy and exaltation
364	of the human spirit, as well.
370	We want a God who can weep with those who weep,
373	and rejoice with those who rejoice.
377	This seems to me both a deeply moving and a convincing re-statement
383	of Christian belief about God.
385	For hundreds of years, the prevailing orthodoxy, the accepted truth,
391	was that God the Father, the Creator, is unchanging
395	and therefore by definition cannot feel pain or sadness.
401	Now the unchanging God feels a bit cold and indifferent to me.
405	And the devastating events of the 20th century
411	have forced people to question the cold, unfeeling God.
414	The slaughter of millions in the trenches and in the death camps
420	"have caused people to ask, ""Where is God in all this?"
424	"Who is God in all this?"""
427	"And the answer was, ""God is in this with us,"
433	"or God doesn't deserve our allegiance anymore."""
438	If God is a bystander, observing but not involved,
443	then God may well exist, but we don't want to know about Him.
447	Many Jews and Christians now feel like this, I know.
452	And I am among them.
455	So we have a suffering God --
457	a God who is intimately connected with this world and with every living soul.
463	I very much relate to this idea of God.
467	But it isn't enough. I need to ask some more questions,
472	and I hope they are questions that you will want to ask, as well,
475	some of you.
478	Over the last few weeks I have been struck by the number of times
482	that words in our worship have felt a bit inappropriate, a bit dodgy.
486	We have a pram service on Tuesday mornings for mums and their pre-school children.
492	And last week we sang with the children one of their favorite songs,
496	"""The Wise Man Built His House Upon the Rock."""
499	Perhaps some of you know it. Some of the words go like this:
502	"""The foolish man built his house upon the sand /"
505	"And the floods came up / And the house on the sand went crash."""
511	Then in the same week, at a funeral,
516	"we sang the familiar hymn ""We Plow the Fields and Scatter,"""
521	a very English hymn.
523	"In the second verse comes the line, ""The wind and waves obey Him."""
528	Do they? I don't feel we can sing that song again in church,
535	after what's happened.
538	So the first big question is about control.
541	Does God have a plan for each of us? Is God in control?
546	Does God order each moment? Does the wind and the waves obey Him?
553	From time to time,
555	one hears Christians telling the story of how God organized things for them,
560	so that everything worked out all right --
562	some difficulty overcome, some illness cured, some trouble averted,
567	a parking space found at a crucial time.
571	I can remember someone saying this to me,
575	with her eyes shining with enthusiasm at this wonderful confirmation of her faith
581	and the goodness of God.
586	But if God can or will do these things --
589	intervene to change the flow of events --
592	then surely he could have stopped the tsunami.
595	Do we have a local God who can do little things like parking spaces,
600	but not big things like 500 mile-per-hour waves?
604	That's just not acceptable to intelligent Christians,
609	and we must acknowledge it.
611	Either God is responsible for the tsunami,
614	or God is not in control.
618	After the tragedy, survival stories began to emerge.
621	You probably heard some of them:
623	the man who surfed the wave,
625	the teenage girl who recognized the danger
628	because she had just been learning about tsunamis at school.
631	Then there was the congregation who had left their usual church building on the shore
636	to hold a service in the hills.
638	The preacher delivered an extra long sermon,
642	so that they were still out of harm's way when the wave struck.
646	Afterwards someone said that God must have been looking after them.
654	So the next question is about partiality.
657	Can we earn God's favor by worshipping Him or believing in Him?
662	Does God demand loyalty, like any medieval tyrant?
666	A God who looks after His own, so that Christians are OK,
673	while everyone else perishes?
675	A cosmic us and them, and a God who is guilty of the worst kind of favoritism?
685	That would be appalling,
687	and that would be the point at which I would hand in my membership.
692	Such a God would be morally inferior to the highest ideals of humanity.
700	So who is God, if not the great puppet-master or the tribal protector?
707	Perhaps God allows or permits terrible things to happen,
711	so that heroism and compassion can be shown.
715	Perhaps God is testing us: testing our charity, or our faith.
720	Perhaps there is a great, cosmic plan that allows for horrible suffering
724	so that everything will work out OK in the end.
727	Perhaps, but these ideas are all just variations on God controlling everything,
736	the supreme commander toying with expendable units in a great campaign.
743	We are still left with a God who can do the tsunami and allow Auschwitz.
751	"In his great novel, ""The Brothers Karamazov,"" Dostoevsky gives these words to Ivan,"
758	addressed to his naive and devout younger brother, Alyosha:
764	"""If the sufferings of children go to make up the sum of sufferings"
767	which is necessary for the purchase of truth,
770	then I say beforehand that the entire truth is not worth such a price.
778	We cannot afford to pay so much for admission.
782	It is not God that I do not accept.
785	"I merely, most respectfully, return Him the ticket."""
793	Or perhaps God set the whole universe going at the beginning
797	and then relinquished control forever,
800	so that natural processes could occur, and evolution run its course.
805	This seems more acceptable,
807	but it still leaves God with the ultimate moral responsibility.
815	Is God a cold, unfeeling spectator?
819	Or a powerless lover, watching with infinite compassion
824	things God is unable to control or change?
828	Is God intimately involved in our suffering,
832	so that He feels it in His own being?
838	If we believe something like this, we must let go of the puppet-master completely,
844	take our leave of the almighty controller, abandon traditional models.
849	We must think again about God.
853	Maybe God doesn't do things at all.
858	Maybe God isn't an agent like all of us are agents.
863	Early religious thought conceived God as a sort of superhuman person,
868	doing things all over the place.
870	Beating up the Egyptians, drowning them in the Red Sea, wasting cities, getting angry.
877	The people knew their God by His mighty acts.
881	But what if God doesn't act? What if God doesn't do things at all?
888	What if God is in things?
892	The loving soul of the universe.
895	An in-dwelling compassionate presence, underpinning and sustaining all things.
903	What if God is in things?
907	In the infinitely complex network of relationships and connections that make up life.
913	In the natural cycle of life and death,
917	the creation and destruction that must happen continuously.
923	In the process of evolution.
925	In the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world.
931	In the collective unconscious, the soul of the human race.
935	In you, in me, mind and body and spirit.
942	In the tsunami, in the victims. In the depth of things.
947	In presence and in absence. In simplicity and complexity.
952	In change and development and growth.
957	How does this in-ness, this innerness, this interiority of God work?
962	It's hard to conceive, and begs more questions.
966	Is God just another name for the universe,
969	with no independent existence at all?
971	I don't know.
973	To what extent can we ascribe personality to God?
980	I don't know.
982	"In the end, we have to say, ""I don't know."""
986	If we knew, God would not be God.
989	To have faith in this God
991	would be more like trusting an essential benevolence in the universe,
997	and less like believing a system of doctrinal statements.
1001	Isn't it ironic that Christians who claim to believe
1005	in an infinite, unknowable being
1007	then tie God down in closed systems and rigid doctrines?
1014	How could one practice such a faith?
1019	By seeking the God within. By cultivating my own inwardness.
1027	In silence, in meditation, in my inner space, in the me that remains
1035	when I gently put aside my passing emotions and ideas and preoccupations.
1044	In awareness of the inner conversation.
1047	And how would we live such a faith? How would I live such a faith?
1053	By seeking intimate connection with your inwardness.
1058	The kind of relationships when deep speaks to deep.
1062	If God is in all people, then there is a meeting place
1066	where my relationship with you becomes a three-way encounter.
1071	There is an Indian greeting, which I'm sure some of you know:
1077	"""Namaste,"" accompanied by a respectful bow,"
1081	which, roughly translated means,
1085	"""That which is of God in me greets that which of God is in you."""
1090	Namaste.
1095	And how would one deepen such a faith?
1098	By seeking the inwardness which is in all things.
1101	In music and poetry, in the natural world of beauty
1106	and in the small ordinary things of life,
1109	there is a deep, indwelling presence that makes them extraordinary.
1114	It needs a profound attentiveness and a patient waiting,
1121	a contemplative attitude and a generosity and openness
1126	to those whose experience is different from my own.
1131	When I stood up to speak to my people about God and the tsunami,
1134	I had no answers to offer them.
1138	No neat packages of faith, with Bible references to prove them.
1143	Only doubts and questioning and uncertainty.
1148	I had some suggestions to make --
1151	possible new ways of thinking about God.
1154	Ways that might allow us to go on, down a new and uncharted road.
1160	"But in the end, the only thing I could say for sure was, ""I don't know,"""
1168	and that just might be the most profoundly religious statement of all.
1174	Thank you.
