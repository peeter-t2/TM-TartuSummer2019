12.949	I'm thrilled to be here tonight
14.773	to share with you something
14.773	we've been working on
17.152	for over two years,
19.242	and it's in the area
19.242	of additive manufacturing,
21.796	also known as 3D printing.
24.513	You see this object here.
26.231	It looks fairly simple,
26.231	but it's quite complex at the same time.
30.549	It's a set of concentric
30.549	geodesic structures
33.8	with linkages between each one.
36.795	In its context, it is not manufacturable
36.795	by traditional manufacturing techniques.
43.343	It has a symmetry such
43.343	that you can't injection mold it.
47.29	You can't even manufacture it
47.29	through milling.
51.47	This is a job for a 3D printer,
54.117	but most 3D printers would take between
54.117	three and 10 hours to fabricate it,
58.598	and we're going to take the risk tonight
58.598	to try to fabricate it onstage
62.824	during this 10-minute talk.
65.401	Wish us luck.
68.35	Now, 3D printing is actually a misnomer.
71.624	It's actually 2D printing
71.624	over and over again,
75.919	and it in fact uses the technologies
75.919	associated with 2D printing.
80.401	Think about inkjet printing where you
80.401	lay down ink on a page to make letters,
85.36	and then do that over and over again
85.36	to build up a three-dimensional object.
90.346	In microelectronics, they use something
92.417	called lithography to do
92.417	the same sort of thing,
94.737	to make the transistors
94.737	and integrated circuits
96.945	and build up a structure several times.
98.997	These are all 2D printing technologies.
102.099	Now, I'm a chemist,
102.099	a material scientist too,
105.987	and my co-inventors
105.987	are also material scientists,
108.711	one a chemist, one a physicist,
111.01	and we began to be
111.01	interested in 3D printing.
113.936	And very often, as you know,
113.936	new ideas are often simple connections
119.531	between people with different experiences
119.531	in different communities,
123.274	and that's our story.
125.591	Now, we were inspired
128.122	"by the ""Terminator 2"" scene for T-1000,"
132.893	and we thought, why couldn't a 3D printer
132.893	operate in this fashion,
138.426	where you have an object
138.426	arise out of a puddle
143.052	in essentially real time
145.52	with essentially no waste
147.749	to make a great object?
150.071	Okay, just like the movies.
151.488	And could we be inspired by Hollywood
154.877	and come up with ways
154.877	to actually try to get this to work?
158.384	And that was our challenge.
160.45	And our approach would be,
160.45	if we could do this,
163.817	then we could fundamentally address
163.817	the three issues holding back 3D printing
167.671	from being a manufacturing process.
170.086	One, 3D printing takes forever.
172.617	There are mushrooms that grow faster
172.617	than 3D printed parts. (Laughter)
179.281	The layer by layer process
181.417	leads to defects
181.417	in mechanical properties,
184.319	and if we could grow continuously,
184.319	we could eliminate those defects.
188.266	And in fact, if we could grow really fast,
188.266	we could also start using materials
193.398	that are self-curing,
193.398	and we could have amazing properties.
198.042	So if we could pull this off,
198.042	imitate Hollywood,
202.151	we could in fact address 3D manufacturing.
206.702	Our approach is to use
206.702	some standard knowledge
209.953	in polymer chemistry
212.553	to harness light and oxygen
212.553	to grow parts continuously.
219.152	Light and oxygen work in different ways.
222.099	Light can take a resin
222.099	and convert it to a solid,
225.141	can convert a liquid to a solid.
227.295	Oxygen inhibits that process.
230.829	So light and oxygen
230.829	are polar opposites from one another
234.08	from a chemical point of view,
236.588	and if we can control spatially
236.588	the light and oxygen,
240.001	we could control this process.
242.288	And we refer to this as CLIP.
242.288	[Continuous Liquid Interface Production.]
245.739	It has three functional components.
248.465	One, it has a reservoir
248.465	that holds the puddle,
252.326	just like the T-1000.
254.205	At the bottom of the reservoir
254.205	is a special window.
256.621	I'll come back to that.
258.112	In addition, it has a stage
258.112	that will lower into the puddle
261.892	and pull the object out of the liquid.
264.481	The third component
264.481	is a digital light projection system
268.285	underneath the reservoir,
270.305	illuminating with light
270.305	in the ultraviolet region.
274.048	Now, the key is that this window
274.048	in the bottom of this reservoir,
277.271	it's a composite,
277.271	it's a very special window.
280.15	It's not only transparent to light
280.15	but it's permeable to oxygen.
283.796	It's got characteristics
283.796	like a contact lens.
287.435	So we can see how the process works.
289.716	You can start to see that
289.716	as you lower a stage in there,
293.13	in a traditional process,
293.13	with an oxygen-impermeable window,
297.309	you make a two-dimensional pattern
300.008	and you end up gluing that onto the window
300.008	with a traditional window,
303.37	and so in order to introduce
303.37	the next layer, you have to separate it,
306.922	introduce new resin, reposition it,
310.451	and do this process over and over again.
313.4	But with our very special window,
315.234	what we're able to do is,
315.234	with oxygen coming through the bottom
318.563	as light hits it,
321.256	that oxygen inhibits the reaction,
323.926	and we form a dead zone.
326.55	This dead zone is on the order
326.55	of tens of microns thick,
330.869	so that's two or three diameters
330.869	of a red blood cell,
334.096	right at the window interface
334.096	that remains a liquid,
336.627	and we pull this object up,
338.577	and as we talked about in a Science paper,
340.969	as we change the oxygen content,
340.969	we can change the dead zone thickness.
345.682	And so we have a number of key variables
345.682	that we control: oxygen content,
349.374	the light, the light intensity,
349.374	the dose to cure,
352.439	the viscosity, the geometry,
354.401	and we use very sophisticated software
354.401	to control this process.
358.697	The result is pretty staggering.
361.46	It's 25 to 100 times faster
361.46	than traditional 3D printers,
366.336	which is game-changing.
368.17	In addition, as our ability
368.17	to deliver liquid to that interface,
372.506	we can go 1,000 times faster I believe,
376.246	and that in fact opens up the opportunity
376.246	for generating a lot of heat,
379.803	and as a chemical engineer,
379.803	I get very excited at heat transfer
383.866	and the idea that we might one day
383.866	have water-cooled 3D printers,
388.045	because they're going so fast.
390.437	In addition, because we're growing things,
390.437	we eliminate the layers,
394.5	and the parts are monolithic.
396.474	You don't see the surface structure.
398.564	You have molecularly smooth surfaces.
401.057	And the mechanical properties
401.057	of most parts made in a 3D printer
405.297	are notorious for having properties
405.297	that depend on the orientation
409.593	with which how you printed it,
409.593	because of the layer-like structure.
413.354	But when you grow objects like this,
415.699	the properties are invariant
415.699	with the print direction.
419.368	These look like injection-molded parts,
422.317	which is very different
422.317	than traditional 3D manufacturing.
425.729	In addition, we're able to throw
429.259	the entire polymer
429.259	chemistry textbook at this,
432.835	and we're able to design chemistries
432.835	that can give rise to the properties
436.826	you really want in a 3D-printed object.
439.868	(Applause)
441.205	There it is. That's great.
446.049	You always take the risk that something
446.049	like this won't work onstage, right?
450.177	But we can have materials
450.177	with great mechanical properties.
453.056	For the first time, we can have elastomers
455.494	that are high elasticity
455.494	or high dampening.
457.955	Think about vibration control
457.955	or great sneakers, for example.
461.368	We can make materials
461.368	that have incredible strength,
464.828	high strength-to-weight ratio,
464.828	really strong materials,
468.404	really great elastomers,
470.517	so throw that in the audience there.
473.242	So great material properties.
475.878	And so the opportunity now,
475.878	if you actually make a part
479.293	that has the properties
479.293	to be a final part,
482.973	and you do it in game-changing speeds,
486.073	you can actually transform manufacturing.
488.86	Right now, in manufacturing,
488.86	what happens is,
491.716	the so-called digital thread
491.716	in digital manufacturing.
494.678	We go from a CAD drawing, a design,
494.678	to a prototype to manufacturing.
499.717	Often, the digital thread is broken
499.717	right at prototype,
502.44	because you can't go
502.44	all the way to manufacturing
504.872	because most parts don't have
504.872	the properties to be a final part.
508.587	We now can connect the digital thread
510.978	all the way from design
510.978	to prototyping to manufacturing,
515.227	and that opportunity
515.227	really opens up all sorts of things,
518.176	from better fuel-efficient cars
518.176	dealing with great lattice properties
523.129	with high strength-to-weight ratio,
525.08	new turbine blades,
525.08	all sorts of wonderful things.
529.468	Think about if you need a stent
529.468	in an emergency situation,
534.623	instead of the doctor pulling off
534.623	a stent out of the shelf
538.593	that was just standard sizes,
540.822	having a stent that's designed
540.822	for you, for your own anatomy
544.978	with your own tributaries,
546.789	printed in an emergency situation
546.789	in real time out of the properties
550.038	such that the stent could go away
550.038	after 18 months: really-game changing.
553.477	Or digital dentistry, and making
553.477	these kinds of structures
557.633	even while you're in the dentist chair.
560.814	And look at the structures
560.814	that my students are making
563.53	at the University of North Carolina.
565.504	These are amazing microscale structures.
568.313	You know, the world is really good
568.313	at nano-fabrication.
571.309	Moore's Law has driven things
571.309	from 10 microns and below.
575.599	We're really good at that,
577.201	but it's actually very hard to make things
577.201	from 10 microns to 1,000 microns,
581.241	the mesoscale.
583.261	And subtractive techniques
583.261	from the silicon industry
586.094	can't do that very well.
587.51	They can't etch wafers that well.
589.159	But this process is so gentle,
591.109	we can grow these objects
591.109	up from the bottom
593.594	using additive manufacturing
595.59	and make amazing things
595.59	in tens of seconds,
597.843	opening up new sensor technologies,
599.932	new drug delivery techniques,
602.417	new lab-on-a-chip applications,
602.417	really game-changing stuff.
607.149	So the opportunity of making
607.149	a part in real time
611.983	that has the properties to be a final part
614.816	really opens up 3D manufacturing,
617.792	and for us, this is very exciting,
617.792	because this really is owning
620.992	the intersection between hardware,
620.992	software and molecular science,
627.589	and I can't wait to see what designers
627.589	and engineers around the world
631.755	are going to be able to do
631.755	with this great tool.
634.499	Thanks for listening.
636.618	(Applause)
