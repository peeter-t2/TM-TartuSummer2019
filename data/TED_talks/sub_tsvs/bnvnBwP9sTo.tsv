12.732	My name is Katrina Spade,
12.732	and I grew up in a medical family
16.3	where it was fairly normal to talk
16.3	about death and dying at the dinner table.
20.9	But I didn't go into medicine
20.9	like so many of my family members.
24.5	Instead, I went to architecture school
24.5	to learn how to design.
29.74	And while I was there,
29.74	I began to be curious
32.14	about what would happen
32.14	to my physical body after I died.
36.26	What would my nearest
36.26	and dearest do with me?
39.78	So if the existence
39.78	and the fact of your own mortality
43.54	doesn't get you down,
45.26	the state of our current
45.26	funerary practices will.
49.74	Today, almost 50 percent of Americans
49.74	choose conventional burial.
55.42	Conventional burial begins with embalming,
57.66	where funeral staff drain bodily fluid
60.46	and replace it with a mixture
60.46	designed to preserve the corpse
64.34	and give it a lifelike glow.
67.26	Then, as you know,
67.26	bodies are buried in a casket
70.82	in a concrete-lined grave
73.02	in a cemetery.
76.3	All told, in US cemeteries,
78.62	we bury enough metal
78.62	to build a Golden Gate Bridge,
83.94	enough wood to build
83.94	1,800 single family homes,
87.86	and enough formaldehyde-laden
87.86	embalming fluid
90.66	to fill eight Olympic-size swimming pools.
94.98	In addition, cemeteries
94.98	all over the world are reaching capacity.
99.54	Turns out, it doesn't really
99.54	make good business sense
102.38	to sell someone
102.38	a piece of land for eternity.
105.94	(Laughter)
107.98	Whose idea was that?
109.62	In some places, you can't buy a plot
109.62	no matter how much money you have.
114.5	As a result, cremation rates
114.5	have risen fast.
118.1	In 1950, if you suggested your grandmother
118.1	be incinerated after she died,
123.18	you'd probably be kicked
123.18	from the family deathbed.
126.34	But today, almost half
126.34	of Americans choose cremation,
130.02	citing simpler,
132.5	cheaper
133.94	and more ecological as reasons.
137.54	I used to think that cremation
137.54	was a sustainable form of disposition,
142.34	but just think about it for a second.
144.78	Cremation destroys the potential we have
147.7	to give back to the earth
147.7	after we've died.
151.26	It uses an energy-intensive process
151.26	to turn bodies into ash,
155.46	polluting the air
155.46	and contributing to climate change.
159.62	All told, cremations in the US
161.94	emit a staggering 600 million
161.94	pounds of carbon dioxide
166.26	into the atmosphere annually.
169.9	The truly awful truth
172.26	is that the very last thing
172.26	that most of us will do on this earth
176.86	is poison it.
182.94	It's like we've created, accepted
182.94	and death-denied our way into a status quo
188.66	that puts as much distance
188.66	between ourselves and nature
192.3	as is humanly possible.
194.42	Our modern funerary practices
194.42	are designed to stave off
197.3	the natural processes
197.3	that happen to a body after death.
200.62	In other words, they're meant
200.62	to prevent us from decomposing.
205.14	But the truth
206.98	is that nature is really,
206.98	really good at death.
211.26	We've all seen it.
212.66	When organic material dies in nature,
215.42	microbes and bacteria
215.42	break it down into nutrient-rich soil,
219.18	completing the life cycle.
221.62	In nature, death creates life.
227.82	Back in architecture school,
227.82	I was thinking about all this,
232.22	and I set out on a plan
232.22	to redesign death care.
235.82	Could I create a system
237.9	that was beneficial to the earth
239.78	and that used nature as a guide
239.78	rather than something to be feared?
244.5	Something that was gentle to the planet?
247.22	That planet, after all,
247.22	supports our living bodies
249.94	our whole lives.
252.98	And while I was mulling this all over
255.5	over the drawing board,
257.42	the phone rang.
259.34	It was my friend Kate.
261.46	"She was like, ""Hey,"
261.46	have you heard about the farmers
265.1	"who are composting whole cows?"""
269.18	"And I was like, ""Mmmm."""
271.339	(Laughter)
274.7	Turns out that farmers
274.7	in agricultural institutions
277.42	have been practicing something
277.42	called livestock mortality composting
280.86	for decades.
282.42	Mortality composting is where
282.42	you take an animal high in nitrogen
286.42	and cover it with co-composting materials
286.42	that are high in carbon.
290.22	It's an aerobic process,
290.22	so it requires oxygen,
293.26	and it requires
293.26	plenty of moisture as well.
296.62	In the most basic setup, a cow
296.62	is covered with a few feet of wood chips,
301.02	which are high in carbon,
302.38	and left outside for nature,
302.38	for breezes to provide oxygen
306.7	and rain to provide moisture.
309.62	In about nine months,
311.86	all that remains
311.86	is a nutrient-rich compost.
315.86	The flesh has been decomposed entirely,
319.22	as have the bones.
322.34	I know.
323.58	(Laughter)
325.1	So I would definitely
325.1	call myself a decomposition nerd,
329.3	but I am far, far from a scientist,
333.06	and one way you can tell this is true
334.9	is that I have often called
334.9	"the process of composting ""magic."""
339.22	(Laughter)
343.1	So basically, all we humans need to do
346.5	is create the right environment
346.5	for nature to do its job.
349.86	It's like the opposite
349.86	of antibacterial soap.
353.38	Instead of fighting them,
354.66	we welcome microbes and bacteria
354.66	in with open arms.
358.66	These tiny, amazing creatures
361.42	break down molecules
361.42	into smaller molecules and atoms,
365.46	which are then incorporated
365.46	into new molecules.
370.1	In other words, that cow is transformed.
373.98	It's no longer a cow.
376.26	It's been cycled back into nature.
379.62	See? Magic.
384.26	You can probably imagine
384.26	the light bulb that went off in my head
387.34	after I received that phone call.
389.46	I began designing a system
391.26	based on the principles
391.26	of livestock mortality composting
395.26	that would take human beings
395.26	and transform them into soil.
403.66	Fast-forward five years
405.58	and the project has grown in ways
405.58	I truly never could have imagined.
409.82	We've created a scalable,
409.82	replicable non-profit urban model
414.3	based on the science
414.3	of livestock mortality composting
417.82	that turns human beings into soil.
421.42	We've partnered and collaborated
421.42	with experts in soil science,
424.78	decomposition, alternative death care,
427.34	law and architecture.
429.5	We've raised funds
429.5	from foundations and individuals
432.78	in order to design
432.78	a prototype of this system,
436.46	and we've heard from tens of thousands
436.46	of people all over the world
440.26	who want this option to be available.
444.9	OK.
446.14	In the next few years,
447.98	it's our goal to build the first
447.98	full-scale human composting facility
453.9	right in the city of Seattle.
455.7	(Applause)
463.7	Imagine it,
465.7	part public park,
467.66	part funeral home,
469.42	part memorial to the people we love,
472.14	a place where we can reconnect
472.14	with the cycles of nature
475.26	and treat bodies
475.26	with gentleness and respect.
480.46	The infrastructure is simple.
482.42	Inside a vertical core,
484.06	bodies and wood chips undergo
484.06	accelerated natural decomposition,
488.18	or composting,
489.5	and are transformed into soil.
492.98	When someone dies, their body
492.98	is taken to a human composting facility.
498.3	After wrapping the deceased
498.3	in a simple shroud,
501.1	friends and family carry the body
501.1	to the top of the core,
504.98	which contains the natural
504.98	decomposition system.
510.5	During a laying in ceremony,
512.38	they gently place the body into the core
514.78	and cover it with wood chips.
517.18	This begins the gentle transformation
517.18	from human to soil.
522.82	Over the next few weeks,
522.82	the body decomposes naturally.
526.78	Microbes and bacteria
526.78	break down carbon, then protein,
529.58	to create a new substance,
531.7	a rich, earthy soil.
534.46	This soil can then be used
534.46	to grow new life.
537.62	Eventually, you could be a lemon tree.
541.406	(Applause)
542.58	Yeah, thank you.
543.82	(Applause)
549.7	Who's thinking about
549.7	lemon meringue pie right now?
552.26	(Laughter)
554.42	A lemon drop?
556.54	Something stronger?
559.14	So in addition to housing the core,
561.38	these buildings will function
561.38	to support the grieving
564.1	by providing space for memorial services
564.1	and end-of-life planning.
568.38	The potential for repurposing is huge.
570.94	Old churches and industrial warehouses
570.94	can be converted into places
575.58	where we create soil and honor life.
579.62	We want to bring back the aspect of ritual
581.82	that's been diluted
581.82	over the past hundred years
584.62	as cremation rates have risen
586.74	and religious affiliation has declined.
591.26	Our Seattle facility will function
591.26	as a model for these places
594.82	all over the world.
596.94	We've heard from communities
596.94	in South Africa, Australia,
600.1	the UK, Canada and beyond.
603.78	We're creating a design toolkit
606.18	that will help others
606.18	design and build facilities
610.06	that will contain technical specifications
612.66	and regulatory best practices.
614.9	We want to help individuals,
614.9	organizations,
617.42	and down the road, municipalities
619.66	design and build facilities
619.66	in their own cities.
623.86	The idea is that every one of these places
623.86	should look and feel completely different
627.86	with the same system inside.
629.78	They're really meant to be designed
629.78	for the neighborhood in which they reside
633.86	and the community which they serve.
638.3	The other idea is
638.3	for supportive staff to be on hand
641.54	to help families with the care
641.54	and preparation of loved ones' bodies.
646.34	We're banishing practices
646.34	that bewilder and disempower
649.78	and creating a system
649.78	that is beautiful and meaningful
654.14	and transparent.
656.9	We believe that access
656.9	to ecological death care
659.58	is a human right.
664.46	OK, so you know the old saying,
667.58	if you can compost a cow,
667.58	you can compost a human?
670.18	(Laughter)
675.1	Turns out, it's true.
678.14	Since 2014, we've been
678.14	running a pilot project
681.22	in the hills of North Carolina
683.1	with the Forensic Anthropology Department
683.1	at Western Carolina University.
688.02	Six donor bodies
688.02	have been covered in wood chips,
691.42	oxygen provided by breezes,
693.74	microbes and bacteria doing their jobs.
697.26	This pilot program has allowed us
697.26	to demonstrate that it's possible
700.78	to harness the incredible power
700.78	of natural decomposition
704.5	to turn human bodies into soil,
707.22	and we're working
707.22	with other universities as well.
710.3	Soil scientists
710.3	at Washington State University,
714.34	the grad students, anyway,
715.9	are working to compost
715.9	teeth with amalgam fillings
719.98	so that we can understand
719.98	what happens to the mercury therein.
723.86	Next up, we'll be beginning experiments
725.94	to determine what happens
725.94	to chemo drugs and pharmaceuticals
729.42	during the composting process,
731.18	and whether additional
731.18	remediation will be needed.
737.46	By the way,
739.22	composting creates a great deal of heat,
741.74	especially this particular
741.74	type of composting.
745.7	One week after we began
745.7	composting our fifth donor body,
750.5	the temperature inside
750.5	that mound of wood chips
753.66	reached 158 degrees Fahrenheit.
757.94	Imagine harnessing that heat
757.94	to create energy
760.98	or comfort the grieving on a cold day.
764.86	The death care revolution has begun.
767.54	It's an exciting time to be alive.
771.46	Thank you.
772.7	(Applause)
