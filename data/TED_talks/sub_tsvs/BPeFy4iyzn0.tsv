12.489	This is a talk about sugar and cancer.
15.709	I became interested in sugar
15.709	when I was in college.
19.01	Not this kind of sugar.
20.886	It was the sugar that our biology
20.886	professors taught us about
25.861	in the context of the coating
25.861	of your cells.
30.553	Maybe you didn't know that your cells
30.553	are coated with sugar.
34.687	And I didn't know that, either,
36.286	until I took these courses in college,
38.465	but back then --
39.901	and this was in, let's just
39.901	call it the 1980s --
44.38	people didn't know much about why
44.38	our cells are coated with sugar.
48.658	And when I dug through my notes,
48.658	what I noticed I had written down
52.649	is that the sugar coating on our cells
52.649	is like the sugar coating
57.218	on a peanut M and M.
59.018	And people thought
59.018	the sugar coating on our cells
62.708	was like a protective coating
64.562	that somehow made our cells
64.562	stronger or tougher.
68.754	But we now know, many decades later,
70.904	that it's much more complicated than that,
73.726	and that the sugars on our cells
73.726	are actually very complex.
79.003	And if you could shrink yourself down
79.003	to a little miniature airplane
84.539	and fly right along
84.539	the surface of your cells,
88.345	it might look something like this --
90.735	with geographical features.
92.96	And now, the complex sugars
92.96	are these trees and bushes --
97.014	weeping willows that are
97.014	swaying in the wind
99.57	and moving with the waves.
101.631	And when I started thinking about
101.631	all these complex sugars
105.468	that are like this foliage on our cells,
108.418	it became one of the most interesting
108.418	problems that I encountered
111.559	as a biologist and also as a chemist.
115.477	And so now we tend
115.477	to think about the sugars
118.436	that are populating
118.436	the surface of our cells
121.728	as a language.
124.162	They have a lot of information
124.162	stored in their complex structures.
128.962	But what are they trying to tell us?
132.368	I can tell you that we do know
132.368	some information
135.707	that comes from these sugars,
137.336	and it's turned out already
137.336	to be incredibly important
140.295	in the world of medicine.
142.597	For example, one thing
142.597	your sugars are telling us
146.282	is your blood type.
148.861	So your blood cells, your red blood
148.861	cells, are coated with sugars,
153.039	and the chemical structures of those
153.039	sugars determine your blood type.
157.74	So for example, I know
157.74	that I am blood type O.
161.687	How many people are also blood type O?
164.822	Put your hands up.
166.004	It's a pretty common one,
167.221	so when so few hands go up,
167.221	either you're not paying attention
170.18	or you don't know your blood type,
170.18	and both of those are bad.
173.094	(Laughter)
174.133	But for those of you who share
174.133	the blood type O with me,
176.82	what this means is that we have
176.82	this chemical structure
179.559	on the surface of our blood cells:
182.116	three simple sugars linked together
182.116	to make a more complex sugar.
185.863	And that, by definition, is blood type O.
189.186	Now, how many people are blood type A?
192.394	Right here.
193.587	That means you have
193.587	an enzyme in your cells
196.572	that adds one more building block,
199.012	that red sugar,
200.411	to build a more complex structure.
202.936	And how many people are blood type B?
206.118	Quite a few.
207.307	You have a slightly different enzyme
207.307	than the A people,
210.059	so you build a slightly
210.059	different structure,
212.199	and those of you that are AB
214.336	have the enzyme from your mother,
214.336	the other enzyme from your father,
217.552	and now you make both of these structures
217.552	in roughly equal proportions.
221.351	And when this was figured out,
223.779	which is now back in the previous century,
226.541	this enabled one of the most important
226.541	medical procedures in the world,
230.082	which, of course,
230.082	is the blood transfusion.
232.484	And by knowing what your blood type is,
234.404	we can make sure,
234.404	if you ever need a transfusion,
237.02	that your donor has the same blood type,
239.565	so that your body
239.565	doesn't see foreign sugars,
243.603	which it wouldn't like
243.603	and would certainly reject.
247.933	What else are the sugars on the surface
247.933	of your cells trying to tell us?
252.932	Well, those sugars might be telling us
252.932	that you have cancer.
258.528	So a few decades ago,
260.804	correlations began to emerge
260.804	from the analysis of tumor tissue.
266.221	And the typical scenario is a patient
266.221	would have a tumor detected,
270.756	and the tissue would be removed
270.756	in a biopsy procedure
274.608	and then sent down to a pathology lab
277.402	where that tissue would be analyzed
277.402	to look for chemical changes
281.557	that might inform the oncologist
281.557	about the best course of treatment.
286.799	And what was discovered
286.799	from studies like that
289.707	is that the sugars have changed
292.595	when the cell transforms
292.595	from being healthy to being sick.
298.643	And those correlations have come up
298.643	again and again and again.
304.317	But a big question in the field
304.317	has been: Why?
308.807	Why do cancers have different sugars?
308.807	What's the importance of that?
313.075	Why does it happen, and what
313.075	can we do about it if it does turn out
316.46	to be related to the disease process?
321.603	So, one of the changes that we study
324.838	is an increase in the density
324.838	of a particular sugar
330.407	that's called sialic acid.
333.437	And I think this is going to be
333.437	one of the most important sugars
337.385	of our times,
338.567	so I would encourage everybody
338.567	to get familiar with this word.
343.322	Sialic acid is not
343.322	the kind of sugar that we eat.
346.311	Those are different sugars.
348.422	This is a kind of sugar
348.422	that is actually found
351.41	at certain levels on all
351.41	of the cells in your body.
354.562	It's actually quite common on your cells.
358.213	But for some reason,
360.271	cancer cells, at least in a successful,
360.271	progressive disease,
365.783	tend to have more sialic acid
368.916	than a normal, healthy cell would have.
371.287	And why?
372.753	What does that mean?
375.096	Well, what we've learned
376.572	is that it has to do
376.572	with your immune system.
380.755	So let me tell you a little bit
380.755	about the importance of your immune system
384.345	in cancer.
385.533	And this is something that's, I think,
385.533	in the news a lot these days.
389.075	You know, people are starting
389.075	to become familiar with the term
392.005	"""cancer immune therapy."""
394.791	And some of you might even know people
396.626	who are benefiting from these very new
396.626	ways of treating cancer.
401.668	What we now know
401.668	is that your immune cells,
404.933	which are the white blood cells
404.933	coursing through your bloodstream,
408.891	protect you on a daily basis
408.891	from things gone bad --
413.571	including cancer.
415.771	And so in this picture,
417.786	those little green balls
417.786	are your immune cells,
420.531	and that big pink cell is a cancer cell.
424.07	And these immune cells go around
424.07	and taste all the cells in your body.
428.859	That's their job.
430.733	And most of the time, the cells taste OK.
433.512	But once in a while,
433.512	a cell might taste bad.
436.564	Hopefully, that's the cancer cell,
438.399	and when those immune cells
438.399	get the bad taste,
440.806	they launch an all-out strike
440.806	and kill those cells.
444.45	So we know that.
445.627	We also know that if you can
445.627	potentiate that tasting,
450.067	if you can encourage those immune cells
450.067	to actually take a big old bite
453.919	out of a cancer cell,
455.186	you get a better job protecting
455.186	yourself from cancer every day
458.801	and maybe even curing a cancer.
461.329	And there are now a couple of drugs
461.329	out there in the market
464.199	that are used to treat cancer patients
466.294	that act exactly by this process.
469.546	They activate the immune system
471.199	so that the immune system
471.199	can be more vigorous
473.97	in protecting us from cancer.
475.746	In fact, one of those drugs
477.813	may well have spared
477.813	President Jimmy Carter's life.
481.336	Do you remember, President Carter
481.336	had malignant melanoma
485.84	that had metastasized to his brain,
488.722	and that diagnosis is one
488.722	that is usually accompanied by numbers
492.1	"like ""months to live."""
494.913	But he was treated with one
494.913	of these new immune-stimulating drugs,
499.332	and now his melanoma
499.332	appears to be in remission,
502.715	which is remarkable,
504.38	considering the situation
504.38	only a few years ago.
507.845	In fact, it's so remarkable
509.689	that provocative statements like this one:
512.513	"""Cancer is having a penicillin moment,"""
512.513	people are saying,
516.252	with these new immune therapy drugs.
518.097	I mean, that's an incredibly bold thing
518.097	to say about a disease
521.319	which we've been fighting for a long time
523.992	and mostly losing the battle with.
526.675	So this is very exciting.
528.727	Now what does this have to do with sugars?
531.163	Well, I'll tell you what we've learned.
534.764	When an immune cell snuggles
534.764	up against a cancer cell to take a taste,
541.124	it's looking for signs of disease,
543.797	and if it finds those signs,
545.74	the cell gets activated and it launches
545.74	a missile strike and kills the cell.
551.089	But if that cancer cell has a dense forest
551.089	of that sugar, sialic acid,
557.551	well, it starts to taste pretty good.
561.327	And there's a protein on immune cells
561.327	that grabs the sialic acid,
565.995	and if that protein
565.995	gets held at that synapse
569.82	between the immune cell
569.82	and the cancer cell,
572.991	it puts that immune cell to sleep.
575.629	The sialic acids are telling
575.629	the immune cell,
578.955	"""Hey, this cell's all right."
578.955	Nothing to see here, move along.
582.18	"Look somewhere else."""
584.561	So in other words,
585.807	as long as our cells are wearing
585.807	a thick coat of sialic acid,
591.219	they look fabulous, right?
593.856	It's amazing.
596.344	And what if you could strip off that coat
599.522	and take that sugar away?
601.844	Well, your immune system
604.867	might be able to see that cancer cell
604.867	for what it really is:
609.092	something that needs to be destroyed.
612.695	And so this is what we're doing in my lab.
615.524	We're developing new medicines
617.87	that are basically
617.87	cell-surface lawnmowers --
621.681	molecules that go down
621.681	to the surface of these cancer cells
625.358	and just cut off those sialic acids,
628.247	so that the immune system
628.247	can reach its full potential
632.576	in eliminating those cancer
632.576	cells from our body.
636.803	So in closing,
639.639	let me just remind you again:
641.816	your cells are coated with sugars.
644.792	The sugars are telling cells
644.792	around that cell
649.511	whether the cell is good or bad.
652.502	And that's important,
653.691	because our immune system needs
653.691	to leave the good cells alone.
656.771	Otherwise, we'd have autoimmune diseases.
660.135	But once in a while,
660.135	cancers get the ability
663.307	to express these new sugars.
664.887	And now that we understand
666.243	how those sugars mesmerize
666.243	the immune system,
669.427	we can come up with new medicines
669.427	to wake up those immune cells,
673.636	"tell them, ""Ignore"
673.636	the sugars, eat the cell
676.887	"and have a delicious snack, on cancer."""
680.394	Thank you.
681.893	(Applause)
