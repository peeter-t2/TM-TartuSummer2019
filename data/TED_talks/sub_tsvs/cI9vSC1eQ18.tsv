13.119	So in 1781, an English composer,
16.59	technologist and astronomer called William Herschel
19.729	noticed an object on the sky that
21.472	didn't quite move the way the rest of the stars did.
24.34	And Herschel's recognition
24.34	that something was different,
27.434	that something wasn't quite right,
29.301	was the discovery of a planet,
31.123	the planet Uranus,
33.2	a name that has entertained
34.555	countless generations of children,
37.715	but a planet that overnight
40.05	doubled the size of our known solar system.
42.666	Just last month, NASA announced the discovery
44.521	of 517 new planets
46.85	in orbit around nearby stars,
48.976	almost doubling overnight the number of planets
51.227	we know about within our galaxy.
53.825	So astronomy is constantly being transformed by this
56.457	capacity to collect data,
58.595	and with data almost doubling every year,
61.14	within the next two decades, me may even
62.948	reach the point for the first time in history
65.266	where we've discovered the majority of the galaxies
68.12	within the universe.
69.844	But as we enter this era of big data,
72.128	what we're beginning to find is there's a difference
74.108	between more data being just better
77.269	and more data being different,
79.249	capable of changing the questions we want to ask,
82.14	and this difference is not about
82.14	how much data we collect,
85.46	it's whether those data open new windows
87.149	into our universe,
88.527	whether they change the way we view the sky.
91.412	So what is the next window into our universe?
94.851	What is the next chapter for astronomy?
97.642	Well, I'm going to show you some
97.642	of the tools and the technologies
100.297	that we're going to develop over the next decade,
102.861	and how these technologies,
104.334	together with the smart use of data,
106.202	may once again transform astronomy
109.172	by opening up a window into our universe,
111.219	the window of time.
113	Why time? Well, time is about origins,
115.584	and it's about evolution.
117.474	The origins of our solar system,
118.97	how our solar system came into being,
121.174	is it unusual or special in any way?
124.583	About the evolution of our universe.
126.574	Why our universe is continuing to expand,
129.58	and what is this mysterious dark energy
131.513	that drives that expansion?
134.128	But first, I want to show you how technology
136.892	is going to change the way we view the sky.
139.663	So imagine if you were sitting
141.17	in the mountains of northern Chile
143.262	looking out to the west
144.669	towards the Pacific Ocean
146.717	a few hours before sunrise.
149.281	This is the view of the night sky that you would see,
152.518	and it's a beautiful view,
154.189	with the Milky Way just peeking out over the horizon.
157.102	but it's also a static view,
159.262	and in many ways, this is the
159.262	way we think of our universe:
162.02	eternal and unchanging.
164.414	But the universe is anything but static.
166.405	It constantly changes on timescales of seconds
168.936	to billions of years.
170.781	Galaxies merge, they collide
172.525	at hundreds of thousands of miles per hour.
175.18	Stars are born, they die,
177.25	they explode in these extravagant displays.
180.4	In fact, if we could go back
181.67	to our tranquil skies above Chile,
184.269	and we allow time to move forward
186.734	to see how the sky might change over the next year,
191.127	the pulsations that you see
193.417	are supernovae, the final remnants of a dying star
197.826	exploding, brightening and then fading from view,
201.573	each one of these supernovae
203.463	five billion times the brightness of our sun,
206.466	so we can see them to great distances
208.806	but only for a short amount of time.
211.302	Ten supernova per second explode somewhere
213.879	in our universe.
215.296	If we could hear it,
216.716	it would be popping like a bag of popcorn.
220.415	Now, if we fade out the supernovae,
223.542	it's not just brightness that changes.
226.771	Our sky is in constant motion.
229.11	This swarm of objects you
229.11	see streaming across the sky
232.28	are asteroids as they orbit our sun,
234.938	and it's these changes and the motion
236.91	and it's the dynamics of the system
239.234	that allow us to build our models for our universe,
241.607	to predict its future and to explain its past.
245.68	But the telescopes we've used over the last decade
248.774	are not designed to capture the data at this scale.
252.789	The Hubble Space Telescope:
254.409	for the last 25 years it's been producing
256.67	some of the most detailed views
258.631	of our distant universe,
260.622	but if you tried to use the Hubble to create an image
262.692	of the sky, it would take 13 million individual images,
267.27	about 120 years to do this just once.
270.982	So this is driving us to new technologies
273.243	and new telescopes,
275.09	telescopes that can go faint
276.832	to look at the distant universe
278.385	but also telescopes that can go wide
281.066	to capture the sky as rapidly as possible,
283.885	telescopes like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope,
287.446	or the LSST,
289.325	possibly the most boring name ever
291.665	for one of the most fascinating experiments
293.644	in the history of astronomy,
295.636	in fact proof, if you should need it,
297.85	that you should never allow 
297.85	a scientist or an engineer
300.518	to name anything, not even your children.
300.518	(Laughter)
306.349	We're building the LSST.
307.814	We expect it to start taking data
307.814	by the end of this decade.
311.195	I'm going to show you how we think
312.894	it's going to transform 
312.894	our views of the universe,
316.471	because one image from the LSST
318.845	is equivalent to 3,000 images
321.23	from the Hubble Space Telescope,
323.356	each image three and a half degrees on the sky,
326.494	seven times the width of the full moon.
329.27	Well, how do you capture an image at this scale?
331.579	Well, you build the largest digital camera in history,
335.73	using the same technology you find
335.73	in the cameras in your cell phone
338.891	or in the digital cameras you 
338.891	can buy in the High Street,
342.682	but now at a scale that is five and a half feet across,
345.802	about the size of a Volkswagen Beetle,
348.21	where one image is three billion pixels.
351.168	So if you wanted to look at an image
352.506	in its full resolution, just a single LSST image,
355.735	it would take about 1,500 
355.735	high-definition TV screens.
360.46	And this camera will image the sky,
363.238	taking a new picture every 20 seconds,
366.276	constantly scanning the sky
368.464	so every three nights, we'll get a completely new view
371.289	of the skies above Chile.
373.672	Over the mission lifetime of this telescope,
376.507	it will detect 40 billion stars and galaxies,
379.859	and that will be for the first time
381.359	we'll have detected more objects in our universe
384.134	than people on the Earth.
386.823	Now, we can talk about this
388.038	in terms of terabytes and petabytes
390.4	and billions of objects,
391.919	but a way to get a sense of the amount of data
393.667	that will come off this camera
395.566	is that it's like playing every TED Talk ever recorded
400.297	simultaneously, 24 hours a day,
403.37	seven days a week, for 10 years.
406.228	And to process this data means
408.489	searching through all of those talks
410.413	for every new idea and every new concept,
412.662	looking at each part of the video
414.518	to see how one frame may have changed
416.543	from the next.
418.388	And this is changing the way that we do science,
420.739	changing the way that we do astronomy,
422.994	to a place where software and algorithms
425.25	have to mine through this data,
427.118	where the software is as critical to the science
430.324	as the telescopes and the 
430.324	cameras that we've built.
434.351	Now, thousands of discoveries
436.938	will come from this project,
438.873	but I'm just going to tell you about two
440.324	of the ideas about origins and evolution
442.687	that may be transformed by our access
444.94	to data at this scale.
447.501	In the last five years, NASA has discovered
449.886	over 1,000 planetary systems
452.147	around nearby stars,
454.24	but the systems we're finding
456.17	aren't much like our own solar system,
458.66	and one of the questions we face is
460.235	is it just that we haven't been looking hard enough
462.553	or is there something special or unusual
464.319	about how our solar system formed?
466.737	And if we want to answer that question,
468.999	we have to know and understand
470.438	the history of our solar system in detail,
473.274	and it's the details that are crucial.
475.411	So now, if we look back at the sky,
479.077	at our asteroids that were streaming across the sky,
482.628	these asteroids are like the
482.628	debris of our solar system.
486.85	The positions of the asteroids
488.858	are like a fingerprint of an earlier time
490.995	when the orbits of Neptune and Jupiter
492.975	were much closer to the sun,
494.87	and as these giant planets migrated
494.87	through our solar system,
498.323	they were scattering the asteroids in their wake.
501.653	So studying the asteroids
502.959	is like performing forensics,
505.08	performing forensics on our solar system,
507.638	but to do this, we need distance,
510.34	and we get the distance from the motion,
512.419	and we get the motion because of our access to time.
516.966	So what does this tell us?
518.668	Well, if you look at the little yellow asteroids
520.895	flitting across the screen,
523.168	these are the asteroids that are moving fastest,
525.598	because they're closest to us, closest to Earth.
528.939	These are the asteroids we may one day
530.446	send spacecraft to, to mine them for minerals,
533.844	but they're also the asteroids that may one day
535.846	impact the Earth,
537.511	like happened 60 million years ago
538.802	with the extinction of the dinosaurs,
541.437	or just at the beginning of the last century,
543.259	when an asteroid wiped out
544.591	almost 1,000 square miles of Siberian forest,
548.18	or even just last year, as one burnt up over Russia,
551.268	releasing the energy of a small nuclear bomb.
554.88	So studying the forensics of our solar system
558.502	doesn't just tell us about the past,
560.56	it can also predict the future, 
560.56	including our future.
566.771	Now when we get distance,
568.739	we get to see the asteroids 
568.739	in their natural habitat,
572.328	in orbit around the sun.
573.65	So every point in this visualization that you can see
576.557	is a real asteroid.
579.32	Its orbit has been calculated
579.32	from its motion across the sky.
583.33	The colors reflect the composition of these asteroids,
586.671	dry and stony in the center,
588.808	water-rich and primitive towards the edge,
591.395	water-rich asteroids which may have seeded
593.679	the oceans and the seas that we find on our planet
597.13	when they bombarded the 
597.13	Earth at an earlier time.
602.127	Because the LSST will be able to go faint
604.959	and not just wide,
606.657	we will be able to see these asteroids
608.465	far beyond the inner part of our solar system,
611.652	to asteroids beyond the 
611.652	orbits of Neptune and Mars,
615.465	to comets and asteroids that may exist
617.726	almost a light year from our sun.
620.956	And as we increase the detail of this picture,
623.565	increasing the detail by factors of 10 to 100,
626.692	we will be able to answer questions such as,
629.122	is there evidence for planets
629.122	outside the orbit of Neptune,
632.711	to find Earth-impacting asteroids
635.218	long before they're a danger,
637.753	and to find out whether, maybe,
639.51	our sun formed on its own or in a cluster of stars,
642.69	and maybe it's this sun's stellar siblings
645.772	that influenced the formation of our solar system,
649.214	and maybe that's one of the reasons why 
649.214	solar systems like ours seem to be so rare.
654.974	Now, distance and changes in our universe —
659.536	distance equates to time,
663.395	as well as changes on the sky.
665.454	Every foot of distance you look away,
668.244	or every foot of distance an object is away,
670.729	you're looking back about a
670.729	billionth of a second in time,
674.318	and this idea or this notion of looking back in time
676.931	has revolutionized our ideas about the universe,
679.562	not once but multiple times.
681.842	The first time was in 1929,
684.654	when an astronomer called Edwin Hubble
686.746	showed that the universe was expanding,
688.995	leading to the ideas of the Big Bang.
691.708	And the observations were simple:
694.29	just 24 galaxies
696.444	and a hand-drawn picture.
701.124	But just the idea that the more distant a galaxy,
705.784	the faster it was receding,
707.854	was enough to give rise to modern cosmology.
711.273	A second revolution happened 70 years later,
713.698	when two groups of astronomers showed
715.77	that the universe wasn't just expanding,
718.203	it was accelerating,
719.528	a surprise like throwing up a ball into the sky
722.871	and finding out the higher that it gets,
725.683	the faster it moves away.
727.461	And they showed this
728.97	by measuring the brightness of supernovae,
731.375	and how the brightness of the supernovae
733.209	got fainter with distance.
735.38	And these observations were more complex.
737.833	They required new technologies and new telescopes,
740.847	because the supernovae were in galaxies
744.897	that were 2,000 times more distant
746.855	than the ones used by Hubble.
749.543	And it took three years to find just 42 supernovae,
754.854	because a supernova only explodes
756.608	once every hundred years within a galaxy.
759.69	Three years to find 42 supernovae
761.974	by searching through tens of thousands of galaxies.
765.993	And once they'd collected their data,
767.844	this is what they found.
771.592	Now, this may not look impressive,
774.303	but this is what a revolution in physics looks like:
778.418	a line predicting the brightness of a supernova
782.894	and a handful of points that don't quite fit that line.
786.69	Small changes give rise to big consequences.
790.803	Small changes allow us to make discoveries,
793.751	like the planet found by Herschel.
796.574	Small changes turn our understanding
798.846	of the universe on its head.
801.247	So 42 supernovae, slightly too faint,
804.711	meaning slightly further away,
806.72	requiring that a universe must not just be expanding,
809.88	but this expansion must be accelerating,
813.21	revealing a component of our universe
815.156	which we now call dark energy,
817.642	a component that drives this expansion
820.151	and makes up 68 percent of the energy budget
823.178	of our universe today.
826.751	So what is the next revolution likely to be?
830.575	Well, what is dark energy and why does it exist?
833.294	Each of these lines shows a different model
835.622	for what dark energy might be,
838.465	showing the properties of dark energy.
840.946	They all are consistent with the 42 points,
844.569	but the ideas behind these lines
846.796	are dramatically different.
848.899	Some people think about a dark energy
851.442	that changes with time,
852.9	or whether the properties of the dark energy
855.188	are different depending on where you look on the sky.
857.944	Others make differences and changes
859.767	to the physics at the sub-atomic level.
862.815	Or, they look at large scales
865.605	and change how gravity and general relativity work,
869.17	or they say our universe is just one of many,
871.961	part of this mysterious multiverse,
874.559	but all of these ideas, all of these theories,
877.72	amazing and admittedly some of them a little crazy,
881.219	but all of them consistent with our 42 points.
885.246	So how can we hope to make sense of this
887.428	over the next decade?
889.7	Well, imagine if I gave you a pair of dice,
892.93	and I said you wanted to see whether those dice
894.929	were loaded or fair.
896.796	One roll of the dice would tell you very little,
899.73	but the more times you rolled them,
901.722	the more data you collected,
903.644	the more confident you would become,
905.816	not just whether they're loaded or fair,
908.419	but by how much, and in what way.
912.317	It took three years to find just 42 supernovae
916.119	because the telescopes that we built
919.166	could only survey a small part of the sky.
922.859	With the LSST, we get a completely new view
925.524	of the skies above Chile every three nights.
929.146	In its first night of operation,
931.609	it will find 10 times the number of supernovae
934.759	used in the discovery of dark energy.
937.9	This will increase by 1,000
939.709	within the first four months:
942.202	1.5 million supernovae by the end of its survey,
946.986	each supernova a roll of the dice,
950.171	each supernova testing which theories of dark energy
953.613	are consistent, and which ones are not.
957.741	And so, by combining these supernova data
961.544	with other measures of cosmology,
963.82	we'll progressively rule out the different ideas
966.71	and theories of dark energy
968.686	until hopefully at the end of this survey around 2030,
975.828	we would expect to hopefully see
978.442	a theory for our universe,
980.584	a fundamental theory for the physics of our universe,
983.123	to gradually emerge.
986.95	Now, in many ways, the questions that I posed
989.342	are in reality the simplest of questions.
993.703	We may not know the answers,
995.457	but we at least know how to ask the questions.
999.309	But if looking through tens of thousands of galaxies
1002.427	revealed 42 supernovae that turned
1005.365	our understanding of the universe on its head,
1008.844	when we're working with billions of galaxies,
1011.758	how many more times are we going to find
1019.183	Like the planet found by Herschel
1021.94	or dark energy
1024.357	or quantum mechanics or general relativity,
1028.2	all ideas that came because the data
1030.544	didn't quite match what we expected.
1033.999	What's so exciting about the next decade of data
1037.26	in astronomy is,
1038.93	we don't even know how many answers
1041.141	are out there waiting,
1042.941	answers about our origins and our evolution.
1046.822	How many answers are out there
1047.917	that we don't even know the questions
1051.211	that we want to ask?
1053.222	Thank you.
1055.169	(Applause)
