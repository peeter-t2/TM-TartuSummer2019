12.738	I haven't told many people this,
14.436	but in my head, I've got
16.832	thousands of secret worlds all going on
18.969	all at the same time.
21.27	I am also autistic.
23.603	People tend to diagnose autism
25.549	with really specific 
25.549	check-box descriptions,
28.868	but in reality, it's a whole
28.868	variation as to what we're like.
31.916	For instance, my little brother,
33.649	he's very severely autistic.
35.426	He's nonverbal. He can't talk at all.
37.688	But I love to talk.
40.18	People often associate autism
43.483	with liking maths and 
43.483	science and nothing else,
46.156	but I know so many autistic people
47.955	who love being creative.
50.328	But that is a stereotype,
52.77	and the stereotypes of things
54.626	are often, if not always, wrong.
57.888	For instance, a lot of people
60.306	think autism and think 
60.306	"""Rain Man"" immediately."
64.559	That's the common belief,
66.051	that every single autistic 
66.051	person is Dustin Hoffman,
69.346	and that's not true.
72.349	But that's not just with 
72.349	autistic people, either.
75.15	I've seen it with LGBTQ people,
77.49	with women, with POC people.
79.91	People are so afraid of variety
82.428	that they try to fit everything 
82.428	into a tiny little box
85.229	with really specific labels.
87.524	This is something that actually
89.155	happened to me in real life:
91.833	"I googled ""autistic people are ..."""
94.521	and it comes up with suggestions
96.624	as to what you're going to type.
98.649	"I googled ""autistic people are ..."""
100.404	"and the top result was ""demons."""
103.617	That is the first thing that people think
105.875	when they think autism.
107.879	They know.
109.785	(Laughter)
116.604	One of the things I can do 
116.604	because I'm autistic —
119.201	it's an ability rather than a disability —
121.642	is I've got a very, very vivid imagination.
125.177	Let me explain it to you a bit.
126.85	It's like I'm walking in two 
126.85	worlds most of the time.
129.1	There's the real world, 
129.1	the world that we all share,
131.634	and there's the world in my mind,
133.614	and the world in my mind 
133.614	is often so much more real
136.651	than the real world.
139.138	Like, it's very easy for 
139.138	me to let my mind loose
142.509	because I don't try and fit 
142.509	myself into a tiny little box.
145.38	That's one of the best 
145.38	things about being autistic.
147.619	You don't have the urge to do that.
149.588	You find what you want to do,
152.356	you find a way to do it, 
152.356	and you get on with it.
155.14	If I was trying to fit myself into a box,
157.293	I wouldn't be here, I 
157.293	wouldn't have achieved
159.445	half the things that I have now.
161.595	There are problems, though.
163.371	There are problems with being autistic,
165.536	and there are problems with
165.536	having too much imagination.
168.256	School can be a problem in general,
170.459	but having also to explain to a teacher
174.49	on a daily basis
176.672	that their lesson is inexplicably dull
180.317	and you are secretly taking refuge
182.938	in a world inside your head in 
182.938	which you are not in that lesson,
186.9	that adds to your list of problems.
190.396	(Laughter)
192.264	Also, when my imagination takes hold,
196.684	my body takes on a life of its own.
198.518	When something very exciting
198.518	happens in my inner world,
201.476	I've just got to run.
202.98	I've got to rock backwards and forwards,
204.896	or sometimes scream.
206.684	This gives me so much energy,
208.934	and I've got to have an 
208.934	outlet for all that energy.
211.555	But I've done that ever 
211.555	since I was a child,
213.659	ever since I was a tiny little girl.
215.377	And my parents thought it was 
215.377	cute, so they didn't bring it up,
218.246	but when I got into school,
219.864	they didn't really agree that it was cute.
222.165	It can be that people 
222.165	don't want to be friends
224.83	with the girl that starts 
224.83	screaming in an algebra lesson.
227.807	And this doesn't normally 
227.807	happen in this day and age,
231.713	but it can be that people don't want 
231.713	to be friends with the autistic girl.
235.29	It can be that people 
235.29	don't want to associate
238.572	with anyone who won't 
238.572	or can't fit themselves
241.336	into a box that's labeled normal.
244.306	But that's fine with me,
246.472	because it sorts the wheat from the chaff,
248.606	and I can find which people 
248.606	are genuine and true
251.373	and I can pick these people as my friends.
253.929	But if you think about it, what is normal?
257.349	What does it mean?
259.16	Imagine if that was the best 
259.16	compliment you ever received.
261.94	"""Wow, you are really normal."""
264.221	(Laughter)
265.606	But compliments are,
269.01	"""you are extraordinary"""
270.418	"or ""you step outside the box."""
272.252	"It's ""you're amazing."""
273.973	So if people want to be these things,
275.863	why are so many people 
275.863	striving to be normal?
278.371	Why are people pouring their 
278.371	brilliant individual light into a mold?
283.385	People are so afraid of variety 
283.385	that they try and force everyone,
288.14	even people who don't want 
288.14	to or can't, to become normal.
291.858	There are camps for LGBTQ people
294.697	or autistic people to try and 
294.697	"make them this ""normal,"""
298.173	and that's terrifying that people 
298.173	would do that in this day and age.
302.698	All in all, I wouldn't trade my autism
302.698	and my imagination for the world.
307.305	Because I am autistic,
309.295	I've presented documentaries to the BBC,
312.287	I'm in the midst of writing a book,
314.526	I'm doing this — this is fantastic —
316.674	and one of the best 
316.674	things that I've achieved,
319.925	that I consider to have achieved,
322.51	is I've found ways of communicating
324.492	with my little brother and sister,
326.337	who as I've said are nonverbal. 
326.337	They can't speak.
329.7	And people would often write
329.7	off someone who's nonverbal,
332.56	but that's silly, because 
332.56	my little brother and sister
335.294	are the best siblings that 
335.294	you could ever hope for.
337.987	They're just the best, 
337.987	and I love them so much
340.274	and I care about them 
340.274	more than anything else.
343.829	I'm going to leave you with one question:
346.507	If we can't get inside the person's minds,
349.644	no matter if they're autistic or not,
351.737	instead of punishing anything
351.737	that strays from normal,
354.774	why not celebrate uniqueness
356.529	and cheer every time someone
356.529	unleashes their imagination?
360.59	Thank you.
362.166	(Applause)
