15.73	As an architect, I often ask myself,
18.179	what is the origin of the forms that we design?
21.019	What kind of forms could we design
23.924	if we wouldn't work with references anymore?
26.747	If we had no bias, if we had no preconceptions,
30.132	what kind of forms could we design
32.339	if we could free ourselves from
33.939	our experience?
36.075	If we could free ourselves from our education?
40.809	What would these unseen forms look like?
43.836	Would they surprise us? Would they intrigue us?
47.547	Would they delight us?
49.962	If so, then how can we go about creating something that is truly new?
53.883	I propose we look to nature.
56.275	Nature has been called the greatest architect of forms.
60.539	And I'm not saying that we should copy nature,
64.127	I'm not saying we should mimic biology,
66.507	instead I propose that we can borrow nature's processes.
69.955	We can abstract them and to create something that is new.
74.409	Nature's main process of creation, morphogenesis,
78.287	is the splitting of one cell into two cells.
82.116	And these cells can either be identical,
84.173	or they can be distinct from each other
86.348	through asymmetric cell division.
88.412	If we abstract this process, and simplify it as much as possible,
92.211	then we could start with a single sheet of paper,
94.444	one surface, and we could make a fold
96.94	and divide the surface into two surfaces.
99.876	We're free to choose where we make the fold.
102.139	And by doing so, we can differentiate the surfaces.
107.049	Through this very simple process,
108.943	we can create an astounding variety of forms.
112.555	Now, we can take this form and use the same process
115.28	to generate three-dimensional structures,
117.272	but rather than folding things by hand,
119.68	we'll bring the structure into the computer,
122.265	and code it as an algorithm.
125.24	And in doing so, we can suddenly fold anything.
128.248	We can fold a million times faster,
130.407	we can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations.
133.568	And as we're seeking to make something three-dimensional,
136.048	we start not with a single surface, but with a volume.
139.264	A simple volume, the cube.
140.617	If we take its surfaces and fold them
142.337	again and again and again and again,
144.393	then after 16 iterations, 16 steps,
147.256	we end up with 400,000 surfaces and a shape that looks,
151.105	for instance, like this.
153.64	And if we change where we make the folds,
156.352	if we change the folding ratio,
157.993	then this cube turns into this one.
161.416	We can change the folding ratio again to produce this shape,
165.555	or this shape.
167.382	So we exert control over the form
169.005	by specifying the position of where we're making the fold,
172.509	but essentially you're looking at a folded cube.
177.215	And we can play with this.
178.279	We can apply different folding ratios to different parts
180.895	of the form to create local conditions.
183.64	We can begin to sculpt the form.
185.583	And because we're doing the folding on the computer,
188.471	we are completely free of any physical constraints.
192.167	So that means that surfaces can intersect themselves,
195.118	they can become impossibly small.
196.607	We can make folds that we otherwise could not make.
200.208	Surfaces can become porous.
202.086	They can stretch. They can tear.
204.815	And all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce.
209.45	But in each case, I didn't design the form.
212.2	I designed the process that generated the form.
216.801	In general, if we make a small change to the folding ratio,
221.289	which is what you're seeing here,
222.884	then the form changes correspondingly.
226.657	But that's only half of the story --
233.236	but this, the geometric equivalent of noise.
238.132	The forms that I showed before were made actually
240.252	through very long trial and error.
241.9	A far more effective way to create forms, I have found,
245.116	is to use information that is already contained in forms.
249.004	A very simple form such as this one actually contains
251.659	a lot of information that may not be visible to the human eye.
255.251	So, for instance, we can plot the length of the edges.
257.732	White surfaces have long edges, black ones have short ones.
261.068	We can plot the planarity of the surfaces, their curvature,
264.645	how radial they are -- all information that may not be
268.732	instantly visible to you,
270.679	but that we can bring out, that we can articulate,
273.104	and that we can use to control the folding.
276.48	So now I'm not specifying a single
278.439	ratio anymore to fold it,
280.615	but instead I'm establishing a rule,
283.167	I'm establishing a link between a property of a surface
285.603	and how that surface is folded.
288.576	And because I've designed the process and not the form,
291.527	I can run the process again and again and again
293.849	to produce a whole family of forms.
308.645	These forms look elaborate, but the process is a very minimal one.
313.088	There is a simple input,
314.217	it's always a cube that I start with,
316.169	and it's a very simple operation -- it's making a fold,
319.745	and doing this over and over again.
323.697	So let's bring this process to architecture.
325.977	How? And at what scale?
327.577	I chose to design a column.
329.305	Columns are architectural archetypes.
332.681	They've been used throughout history to express ideals
335.748	about beauty, about technology.
340.823	A challenge to me was how we could express
342.745	this new algorithmic order in a column.
346.041	I started using four cylinders.
349.025	Through a lot of experimentation, these cylinders
352.801	eventually evolved into this.
355.936	And these columns, they have information at very many scales.
360.552	We can begin to zoom into them.
363.07	The closer one gets, the more new features one discovers.
366.625	Some formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility.
370.297	And unlike traditional architecture,
372.249	it's a single process that creates both the overall form
375.033	and the microscopic surface detail.
380.378	These forms are undrawable.
383.069	An architect who's drawing them with a pen and a paper
386.445	would probably take months,
388.237	or it would take even a year to draw all the sections,
390.621	all of the elevations, you can only create something like this
392.925	through an algorithm.
395.061	The more interesting question, perhaps, is,
397.093	are these forms imaginable?
399.722	Usually, an architect can somehow envision the end state
402.357	of what he is designing.
404.221	In this case, the process is deterministic.
407.046	There's no randomness involved at all,
409.405	but it's not entirely predictable.
411.412	There's too many surfaces,
412.988	there's too much detail, one can't see the end state.
416.598	So this leads to a new role for the architect.
419.812	One needs a new method to explore all of the possibilities
423.423	that are out there.
425.199	For one thing, one can design many variants of a form,
428.431	in parallel, and one can cultivate them.
430.645	And to go back to the analogy with nature,
432.893	one can begin to think in terms of populations,
435.389	one can talk about permutations, about generations,
438.917	about crossing and breeding to come up with a design.
443.78	And the architect is really, he moves into the position
446.165	of being an orchestrator of all of these processes.
449.597	But enough of the theory.
451.941	At one point I simply wanted to jump inside
454.468	this image, so to say, I bought these red and blue
458.297	3D glasses, got up very close to the screen,
461.233	but still that wasn't the same as being able to
463.305	walk around and touch things.
465.657	So there was only one possibility --
467.56	to bring the column out of the computer.
470.657	There's been a lot of talk now about 3D printing.
473.577	For me, or for my purpose at this moment,
476.536	there's still too much of an unfavorable tradeoff
479.618	between scale, on the one hand, and resolution and speed, on the other.
486.401	So instead, we decided to take the column,
488.658	and we decided to build it as a layered model,
491.097	made out of very many slices, thinly stacked over each other.
495.225	What you're looking at here is an X-ray
497.122	of the column that you just saw, viewed from the top.
499.897	Unbeknownst to me at the time,
501.897	because we had only seen the outside,
504.273	the surfaces were continuing to fold themselves,
506.433	to grow on the inside of the column,
508.697	which was quite a surprising discovery.
511.243	From this shape, we calculated a cutting line,
514.857	and then we gave this cutting line to a laser cutter
517.881	to produce -- and you're seeing a segment of it here --
521.695	very many thin slices, individually cut, on top of each other.
528.74	And this is a photo now, it's not a rendering,
531.553	and the column that we ended up with
533.353	after a lot of work, ended up looking remarkably like the one
536.4	that we had designed in the computer.
540.11	Almost all of the details, almost all of the
542.231	surface intricacies were preserved.
547.886	But it was very labor intensive.
550.232	There's a huge disconnect at the moment still
552.633	between the virtual and the physical.
555.393	It took me several months to design the column,
557.519	but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds
560.237	to calculate all of the 16 million faces.
563.085	The physical model, on the other hand,
565.046	is 2,700 layers, one millimeter thick,
569.254	it weighs 700 kilos, it's made of sheet that can cover
573.401	this entire auditorium.
575.539	And the cutting path that the laser followed
577.627	goes from here to the airport and back again.
582.744	But it is increasingly possible.
584.493	Machines are getting faster, it's getting less expensive,
587.104	and there's some promising technological developments
589.864	just on the horizon.
591.647	These are images from the Gwangju Biennale.
594.719	And in this case, I used ABS plastic to produce the columns,
598.243	we used the bigger, faster machine,
600.097	and they have a steel core inside, so they're structural,
603.154	they can bear loads for once.
606.13	Each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns.
608.145	You can see a different column in the mirror,
611.554	if there's a mirror behind the column
613.604	that creates a sort of an optical illusion.
616.691	So where does this leave us?
618.522	I think this project gives us a glimpse of the unseen objects that await us
622.99	if we as architects begin to think about designing not the object,
626.873	but a process to generate objects.
630.266	I've shown one simple process that was inspired by nature;
633.539	there's countless other ones.
636.387	In short, we have no constraints.
639.834	Instead, we have processes in our hands right now
643.404	that allow us to create structures at all scales
647.985	that we couldn't even have dreamt up.
651.017	And, if I may add, at one point we will build them.
655.836	Thank you. (Applause)
