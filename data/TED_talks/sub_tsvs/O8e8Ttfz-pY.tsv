12.868	When I was a young boy,
14.654	I used to gaze through the microscope of my father
17.262	at the insects in amber that he kept in the house.
20.62	And they were remarkably well preserved,
23.177	morphologically just phenomenal.
25.422	And we used to imagine that someday,
27.616	they would actually come to life
29.225	and they would crawl out of the resin,
31.222	and, if they could, they would fly away.
33.966	If you had asked me 10 years ago whether or not
36.342	we would ever be able to sequence the genome of extinct animals,
39.54	I would have told you, it's unlikely.
42.015	If you had asked whether or not we would actually be able
43.91	to revive an extinct species,
46.062	I would have said, pipe dream.
47.721	But I'm actually standing here today, amazingly,
50.246	to tell you that not only is the sequencing
52.253	of extinct genomes a possibility, actually a modern-day reality,
56.443	but the revival of an extinct species is actually within reach,
60.736	maybe not from the insects in amber --
62.575	in fact, this mosquito was actually used
64.535	"for the inspiration for ""Jurassic Park"" â€”"
66.887	but from woolly mammoths, the well preserved remains
69.447	of woolly mammoths in the permafrost.
71.654	Woollies are a particularly interesting,
73.727	quintessential image of the Ice Age.
76.273	They were large. They were hairy.
78.098	They had large tusks, and we seem to have
80.082	a very deep connection with them, like we do with elephants.
82.982	Maybe it's because elephants share
85.497	many things in common with us.
87.319	They bury their dead. They educate the next of kin.
90.047	They have social knits that are very close.
93.067	Or maybe it's actually because we're bound by deep time,
95.937	because elephants, like us, share their origins in Africa
99.275	some seven million years ago,
101.398	and as habitats changed and environments changed,
104.192	we actually, like the elephants, migrated out
107.802	into Europe and Asia.
110.022	So the first large mammoth that appears on the scene
112.725	is meridionalis, which was standing four meters tall
116.131	weighing about 10 tons, and was a woodland-adapted species
119.963	and spread from Western Europe clear across Central Asia,
122.925	across the Bering land bridge
125.175	and into parts of North America.
127.485	And then, again, as climate changed as it always does,
130.173	and new habitats opened up,
131.683	we had the arrival of a steppe-adapted species
134.159	called trogontherii in Central Asia
136.407	pushing meridionalis out into Western Europe.
139.157	And the open grassland savannas of North America
141.552	opened up, leading to the Columbian mammoth,
143.712	a large, hairless species in North America.
146.252	And it was really only about 500,000 years later
149.163	that we had the arrival of the woolly,
151.868	the one that we all know and love so much,
153.896	spreading from an East Beringian point of origin
157.206	across Central Asia, again pushing the trogontherii
160.092	out through Central Europe,
161.743	and over hundreds of thousands of years
163.809	migrating back and forth across the Bering land bridge
166.893	during times of glacial peaks
168.92	and coming into direct contact
170.716	with the Columbian relatives living in the south,
173.52	and there they survive over hundreds of thousands of years
176.808	during traumatic climatic shifts.
178.985	So there's a highly plastic animal dealing with great transitions
183.201	in temperature and environment, and doing very, very well.
186.049	And there they survive on the mainland until about 10,000 years ago,
190.04	and actually, surprisingly, on the small islands off of Siberia
193.193	and Alaska until about 3,000 years ago.
195.667	So Egyptians are building pyramids
197.356	and woollies are still living on islands.
200.122	And then they disappear.
201.671	Like 99 percent of all the animals that have once lived,
203.925	they go extinct, likely due to a warming climate
207.204	and fast-encroaching dense forests
209.286	that are migrating north,
210.787	and also, as the late, great Paul Martin once put it,
213.76	probably Pleistocene overkill,
215.511	so the large game hunters that took them down.
218.084	Fortunately, we find millions of their remains
220.346	strewn across the permafrost buried deep
223.023	in Siberia and Alaska, and we can actually go up there
226.148	and actually take them out.
228.058	And the preservation is, again,
229.582	like those insects in [amber], phenomenal.
232.152	So you have teeth, bones with blood
235.672	which look like blood, you have hair,
237.712	and you have intact carcasses or heads
239.239	which still have brains in them.
242.182	So the preservation and the survival of DNA
244.553	depends on many factors, and I have to admit,
246.625	most of which we still don't quite understand,
248.953	but depending upon when an organism dies
251.025	and how quickly he's buried, the depth of that burial,
255.514	the constancy of the temperature of that burial environment,
258.816	will ultimately dictate how long DNA will survive
261.384	over geologically meaningful time frames.
264.245	And it's probably surprising to many of you
265.889	sitting in this room that it's not the time that matters,
269.029	it's not the length of preservation,
270.656	it's the consistency of the temperature of that preservation that matters most.
274.638	So if we were to go deep now within the bones
277.457	and the teeth that actually survived the fossilization process,
280.432	the DNA which was once intact, tightly wrapped
283.824	around histone proteins, is now under attack
286.192	by the bacteria that lived symbiotically with the mammoth
289.158	for years during its lifetime.
290.968	So those bacteria, along with the environmental bacteria,
294.169	free water and oxygen, actually break apart the DNA
297.872	into smaller and smaller and smaller DNA fragments,
300.417	until all you have are fragments that range
302.738	from 10 base pairs to, in the best case scenarios,
305.419	a few hundred base pairs in length.
307.792	So most fossils out there in the fossil record
310.103	are actually completely devoid of all organic signatures.
312.816	But a few of them actually have DNA fragments
315.249	that survive for thousands,
317.123	even a few millions of years in time.
320.872	And using state-of-the-art clean room technology,
323.06	we've devised ways that we can actually pull these DNAs
325.724	away from all the rest of the gunk in there,
328.228	and it's not surprising to any of you sitting in the room
330.427	that if I take a mammoth bone or a tooth
332.548	and I extract its DNA that I'll get mammoth DNA,
335.547	but I'll also get all the bacteria that once lived with the mammoth,
339.358	and, more complicated, I'll get all the DNA
341.605	that survived in that environment with it,
343.789	so the bacteria, the fungi, and so on and so forth.
346.963	Not surprising then again that a mammoth
349.368	preserved in the permafrost will have something
351.04	on the order of 50 percent of its DNA being mammoth,
353.908	whereas something like the Columbian mammoth,
355.931	living in a temperature and buried in a temperate environment
358.548	over its laying-in will only have 3 to 10 percent endogenous.
362.365	But we've come up with very clever ways
364.808	that we can actually discriminate, capture and discriminate,
367.914	the mammoth from the non-mammoth DNA,
369.889	and with the advances in high-throughput sequencing,
372.439	we can actually pull out and bioinformatically
375.276	re-jig all these small mammoth fragments
378.245	and place them onto a backbone
380.542	of an Asian or African elephant chromosome.
383.101	And so by doing that, we can actually get all the little points
385.677	that discriminate between a mammoth and an Asian elephant,
388.502	and what do we know, then, about a mammoth?
391.541	Well, the mammoth genome is almost at full completion,
394.694	and we know that it's actually really big. It's mammoth.
398.235	So a hominid genome is about three billion base pairs,
401.42	but an elephant and mammoth genome
402.997	is about two billion base pairs larger, and most of that
405.653	is composed of small, repetitive DNAs
408.277	that make it very difficult to actually re-jig the entire structure of the genome.
412.91	So having this information allows us to answer
415.271	one of the interesting relationship questions
417.406	between mammoths and their living relatives,
419.578	the African and the Asian elephant,
421.622	all of which shared an ancestor seven million years ago,
424.789	but the genome of the mammoth shows it to share
426.878	a most recent common ancestor with Asian elephants
429.658	about six million years ago,
431.074	so slightly closer to the Asian elephant.
433.547	With advances in ancient DNA technology,
436.271	we can actually now start to begin to sequence
438.224	the genomes of those other extinct mammoth forms that I mentioned,
441.535	and I just wanted to talk about two of them,
443.422	the woolly and the Columbian mammoth,
445.476	both of which were living very close to each other
447.894	during glacial peaks,
450.519	so when the glaciers were massive in North America,
452.682	the woollies were pushed into these subglacial ecotones,
455.277	and came into contact with the relatives living to the south,
458.488	and there they shared refugia,
460.5	and a little bit more than the refugia, it turns out.
462.884	It looks like they were interbreeding.
465.384	And that this is not an uncommon feature
467.017	in Proboscideans, because it turns out
468.655	that large savanna male elephants will outcompete
471.568	the smaller forest elephants for their females.
474.936	So large, hairless Columbians
477.248	outcompeting the smaller male woollies.
479.051	It reminds me a bit of high school, unfortunately.
481.669	(Laughter)
484.008	So this is not trivial, given the idea that we want
486.702	to revive extinct species, because it turns out
488.907	that an African and an Asian elephant
490.727	can actually interbreed and have live young,
492.822	and this has actually occurred by accident in a zoo
494.963	in Chester, U.K., in 1978.
498.005	So that means that we can actually take Asian elephant chromosomes,
501.151	modify them into all those positions we've actually now
503.309	been able to discriminate with the mammoth genome,
505.693	we can put that into an enucleated cell,
508.474	differentiate that into a stem cell,
510.733	subsequently differentiate that maybe into a sperm,
513.053	artificially inseminate an Asian elephant egg,
515.677	and over a long and arduous procedure,
518.784	actually bring back something that looks like this.
522.293	Now, this wouldn't be an exact replica,
523.983	because the short DNA fragments that I told you about
526.465	will prevent us from building the exact structure,
528.946	but it would make something that looked and felt
530.482	very much like a woolly mammoth did.
533.589	Now, when I bring up this with my friends,
536.333	we often talk about, well, where would you put it?
538.941	Where are you going to house a mammoth?
540.629	There's no climates or habitats suitable.
542.669	Well, that's not actually the case.
544.009	It turns out that there are swaths of habitat
546.902	in the north of Siberia and Yukon
549.237	that actually could house a mammoth.
550.443	Remember, this was a highly plastic animal
552.688	that lived over tremendous climate variation.
555.349	So this landscape would be easily able to house it,
558.231	and I have to admit that there [is] a part of the child in me,
561.891	the boy in me, that would love to see
563.176	these majestic creatures walk across the permafrost
566.022	of the north once again, but I do have to admit
568.477	that part of the adult in me sometimes wonders
570.621	whether or not we should.
573.026	Thank you very much.
574.711	(Applause)
579.909	Ryan Phelan: Don't go away.
581.426	You've left us with a question.
583.158	"I'm sure everyone is asking this. When you say, ""Should we?"""
586.682	it feels like you're reticent there,
589.291	and yet you've given us a vision of it being so possible.
592.269	What's your reticence?
593.595	Hendrik Poinar: I don't think it's reticence.
594.901	I think it's just that we have to think very deeply
598.699	about the implications, ramifications of our actions,
601.25	and so as long as we have good, deep discussion
603.45	like we're having now, I think
605.466	we can come to a very good solution as to why to do it.
608.172	But I just want to make sure that we spend time
609.809	thinking about why we're doing it first.
611.658	RP: Perfect. Perfect answer. Thank you very much, Hendrik.
614.439	HP: Thank you. (Applause)
