13.343	For more than 100 years,
15.096	the telephone companies have provided
15.096	wiretapping assistance to governments.
19.146	For much of this time,
19.146	this assistance was manual.
22.708	Surveillance took place manually
22.708	and wires were connected by hand.
26.85	Calls were recorded to tape.
29.334	But as in so many other industries,
31.502	computing has changed everything.
33.725	The telephone companies
33.725	built surveillance features
36.772	into the very core of their networks.
39.494	I want that to sink in for a second:
41.498	Our telephones and the networks
41.498	that carry our calls
45.782	were wired for surveillance first.
48.179	First and foremost.
50.763	So what that means is that
50.763	when you're talking to your spouse,
54.613	your children, a colleague
54.613	or your doctor on the telephone,
58.959	someone could be listening.
60.901	Now, that someone might
60.901	be your own government;
63.49	it could also be another government,
63.49	a foreign intelligence service,
67.677	or a hacker, or a criminal, or a stalker
70.528	or any other party that breaks into
70.528	the surveillance system,
74.122	that hacks into the surveillance system
74.122	of the telephone companies.
79.834	But while the telephone companies
79.834	have built surveillance as a priority,
84.38	Silicon Valley companies have not.
86.523	And increasingly,
86.523	over the last couple years,
89.066	Silicon Valley companies have built
89.066	strong encryption technology
92.752	into their communications products
94.714	that makes surveillance
94.714	extremely difficult.
97.416	For example, many of you
97.416	might have an iPhone,
99.614	and if you use an iPhone
99.614	to send a text message
102.328	to other people who have an iPhone,
104.529	those text messages
104.529	cannot easily be wiretapped.
107.563	And in fact, according to Apple,
109.415	they're not able to even see
109.415	the text messages themselves.
112.662	Likewise, if you use FaceTime
112.662	to make an audio call
116.552	or a video call with one of your
116.552	friends or loved ones,
119.187	that, too, cannot be easily wiretapped.
121.34	And it's not just Apple.
123.315	WhatsApp, which is now owned by Facebook
125.691	and used by hundreds of millions
125.691	of people around the world,
128.573	also has built strong
128.573	encryption technology into its product,
132.104	which means that people
132.104	in the Global South can easily communicate
135.635	without their governments,
135.635	often authoritarian,
138.469	wiretapping their text messages.
141.599	So, after 100 years of being able
141.599	to listen to any telephone call --
146.568	anytime, anywhere --
149.146	you might imagine that government
149.146	officials are not very happy.
152.301	And in fact, that's what's happening.
154.111	Government officials are extremely mad.
156.354	And they're not mad because
156.354	these encryption tools are now available.
160.253	What upsets them the most
162.095	is that the tech companies have built
162.095	encryption features into their products
166.286	and turned them on by default.
168.547	It's the default piece that matters.
170.541	In short, the tech companies
170.541	have democratized encryption.
175.165	And so, government officials
175.165	like British Prime Minister David Cameron,
178.986	they believe that all communications --
178.986	emails, texts, voice calls --
183.857	all of these should be
183.857	available to governments,
186.469	and encryption is making that difficult.
189.478	Now, look -- I'm extremely sympathetic
189.478	to their point of view.
192.886	We live in a dangerous time
192.886	in a dangerous world,
195.442	and there really are bad people out there.
197.466	There are terrorists and other
197.466	serious national security threats
200.605	that I suspect we all want
200.605	the FBI and the NSA to monitor.
205.345	But those surveillance
205.345	features come at a cost.
209.357	The reason for that is
210.536	that there is no such thing
210.536	as a terrorist laptop,
213.046	or a drug dealer's cell phone.
214.902	We all use the same
214.902	communications devices.
218.577	What that means is that
218.577	if the drug dealers' telephone calls
222.276	or the terrorists' telephone calls
222.276	can be intercepted,
224.845	then so can the rest of ours, too.
226.865	And I think we really need to ask:
228.516	Should a billion people
228.516	around the world be using devices
231.667	that are wiretap friendly?
235.407	So the scenario of hacking of surveillance
235.407	systems that I've described --
239.179	this is not imaginary.
241.622	In 2009,
242.798	the surveillance systems that Google
242.798	and Microsoft built into their networks --
246.869	the systems that they use to respond
246.869	to lawful surveillance requests
250.384	from the police --
251.574	those systems were compromised
251.574	by the Chinese government,
254.266	because the Chinese government
254.266	wanted to figure out
256.687	which of their own agents
256.687	the US government was monitoring.
260.269	By the same token,
261.564	in 2004, the surveillance system
261.564	built into the network
265.007	of Vodafone Greece --
265.007	Greece's largest telephone company --
268.205	was compromised by an unknown entity,
270.808	and that feature,
270.808	the surveillance feature,
272.872	was used to wiretap
272.872	the Greek Prime Minister
275.174	and members of the Greek cabinet.
277.313	The foreign government or hackers
277.313	who did that were never caught.
281.955	And really, this gets to the very problem
281.955	with these surveillance features,
285.676	or backdoors.
286.96	When you build a backdoor
286.96	into a communications network
290.186	or piece of technology,
291.511	you have no way of controlling
291.511	who's going to go through it.
295.243	You have no way of controlling
296.712	whether it'll be used by your side
296.712	or the other side,
299.506	by good guys, or by bad guys.
301.98	And so for that reason,
301.98	I think that it's better
304.523	to build networks
304.523	to be as secure as possible.
308.271	Yes, this means that in the future,
310.704	encryption is going to make
310.704	wiretapping more difficult.
313.28	It means that the police
313.28	are going to have a tougher time
315.949	catching bad guys.
317.309	But the alternative would mean
317.309	to live in a world
319.889	where anyone's calls or anyone's
319.889	text messages could be surveilled
323.544	by criminals, by stalkers
323.544	and by foreign intelligence agencies.
327.294	And I don't want to live
327.294	in that kind of world.
330.102	And so right now,
330.102	you probably have the tools
332.841	to thwart many kinds
332.841	of government surveillance
335.183	already on your phones
335.183	and already in your pockets,
338.19	you just might not realize how strong
338.19	and how secure those tools are,
341.993	or how weak the other ways
341.993	you've used to communicate really are.
346.737	And so, my message to you is this:
350.11	We need to use these tools.
352.239	We need to secure our telephone calls.
354.567	We need to secure our text messages.
356.95	I want you to use these tools.
358.626	I want you to tell your loved ones,
358.626	I want you to tell your colleagues:
362.006	Use these encrypted communications tools.
364.454	Don't just use them
364.454	because they're cheap and easy,
367.154	but use them because they're secure.
369.182	Thank you.
370.461	(Applause)
