12.509	I'd like to tell you about a legal case that I worked on
16.841	involving a man named Steve Titus.
20.404	Titus was a restaurant manager.
23.433	He was 31 years old, he lived in Seattle, Washington,
27.523	he was engaged to Gretchen,
29.418	about to be married, she was the love of his life.
32.366	And one night, the couple went out
34.65	for a romantic restaurant meal.
37.655	They were on their way home,
39.303	and they were pulled over by a police officer.
42.253	You see, Titus' car sort of resembled
45.57	a car that was driven earlier in the evening
49.457	by a man who raped a female hitchhiker,
52.863	and Titus kind of resembled that rapist.
56.457	So the police took a picture of Titus,
59.035	they put it in a photo lineup,
61.802	they later showed it to the victim,
63.962	and she pointed to Titus' photo.
66.122	"She said, ""That one's the closest."""
69.743	The police and the prosecution proceeded with a trial,
73.631	and when Steve Titus was put on trial for rape,
76.972	the rape victim got on the stand
79.068	"and said, ""I'm absolutely positive that's the man."""
83.41	And Titus was convicted.
86.336	He proclaimed his innocence,
88.31	his family screamed at the jury,
90.892	his fiancée collapsed on the floor sobbing,
93.763	and Titus is taken away to jail.
97.158	So what would you do at this point?
100.616	What would you do?
102.252	Well, Titus lost complete faith in the legal system,
106.02	and yet he got an idea.
108.052	He called up the local newspaper,
110.483	he got the interest of an investigative journalist,
113.87	and that journalist actually found the real rapist,
118.606	a man who ultimately confessed to this rape,
121.959	a man who was thought to have committed 50 rapes
125.251	in that area,
126.583	and when this information was given to the judge,
129.757	the judge set Titus free.
132.693	And really, that's where this case should have ended.
136.724	It should have been over.
137.847	Titus should have thought of this as a horrible year,
140.367	a year of accusation and trial, but over.
144.203	It didn't end that way.
146.25	Titus was so bitter.
148.928	He'd lost his job. He couldn't get it back.
151.508	He lost his fiancée.
153.351	She couldn't put up with his persistent anger.
156.257	He lost his entire savings,
158.403	and so he decided to file a lawsuit
161.261	against the police and others whom he felt
163.542	were responsible for his suffering.
165.861	And that's when I really started working on this case,
170.574	trying to figure out
172.535	how did that victim go from
174.609	"""That one's the closest"""
176.137	"to ""I'm absolutely positive that's the guy."""
180.887	Well, Titus was consumed with his civil case.
184.166	He spent every waking moment thinking about it,
187.2	and just days before he was to have his day in court,
191.351	he woke up in the morning,
193.57	doubled over in pain,
195.378	and died of a stress-related heart attack.
198.072	He was 35 years old.
201.259	So I was asked to work on Titus' case
206.069	because I'm a psychological scientist.
208.584	I study memory. I've studied memory for decades.
212.411	And if I meet somebody on an airplane --
215.8	this happened on the way over to Scotland --
217.896	if I meet somebody on an airplane,
219.726	"and we ask each other, ""What do you do? What do you do?"""
222.771	"and I say ""I study memory,"""
224.222	they usually want to tell me how they have trouble remembering names,
227.602	or they've got a relative who's got Alzheimer's
230.416	or some kind of memory problem,
232.481	but I have to tell them
234.697	I don't study when people forget.
238.202	I study the opposite: when they remember,
241.204	when they remember things that didn't happen
243.957	or remember things that were different
245.922	from the way they really were.
247.947	I study false memories.
252.683	Unhappily, Steve Titus is not the only person
256.99	to be convicted based on somebody's false memory.
261.295	In one project in the United States,
264.603	information has been gathered
266.855	on 300 innocent people,
274.684	They spent 10, 20, 30 years in prison for these crimes,
279.984	and now DNA testing has proven
282.411	that they are actually innocent.
285.327	And when those cases have been analyzed,
287.848	three quarters of them
289.989	are due to faulty memory, faulty eyewitness memory.
295.6	Well, why?
296.863	Like the jurors who convicted those innocent people
300.314	and the jurors who convicted Titus,
302.598	many people believe that memory
304.839	works like a recording device.
306.486	You just record the information,
308.743	then you call it up and play it back
311.39	when you want to answer questions or identify images.
314.817	But decades of work in psychology
316.98	has shown that this just isn't true.
320.133	Our memories are constructive.
322.563	They're reconstructive.
324.132	Memory works a little bit more like a Wikipedia page:
327.613	You can go in there and change it, but so can other people.
332.726	I first started studying this constructive memory process
337.975	in the 1970s.
340.39	I did my experiments that involved showing people
344.813	simulated crimes and accidents
347.318	and asking them questions about what they remember.
350.836	In one study, we showed people a simulated accident
354.775	and we asked people,
356.053	how fast were the cars going when they hit each other?
358.917	And we asked other people,
360.551	how fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?
364.24	"And if we asked the leading ""smashed"" question,"
367.242	the witnesses told us the cars were going faster,
370.527	"and moreover, that leading ""smashed"" question"
374.524	caused people to be more likely to tell us
377.384	that they saw broken glass in the accident scene
380.451	when there wasn't any broken glass at all.
384.23	In another study, we showed a simulated accident
387.119	where a car went through an intersection with a stop sign,
390.779	and if we asked a question that insinuated it was a yield sign,
395.711	many witnesses told us they remember seeing a yield sign
399.56	at the intersection, not a stop sign.
403.017	And you might be thinking, well, you know,
405.206	these are filmed events,
406.529	they are not particularly stressful.
408.457	Would the same kind of mistakes be made
411.191	with a really stressful event?
414.142	In a study we published just a few months ago,
417.233	we have an answer to this question,
419.537	because what was unusual about this study
422.301	is we arranged for people to have a very stressful experience.
427.933	The subjects in this study
430.162	were members of the U.S. military
432.672	who were undergoing a harrowing training exercise
437.097	to teach them what it's going to be like for them
439.879	if they are ever captured as prisoners of war.
443.797	And as part of this training exercise,
446.227	these soldiers are interrogated in an aggressive,
449.756	hostile, physically abusive fashion for 30 minutes
454.842	and later on they have to try to identify
457.659	the person who conducted that interrogation.
460.682	And when we feed them suggestive information
464.505	that insinuates it's a different person,
467.283	many of them misidentify their interrogator,
471.32	often identifying someone who doesn't even remotely
475.155	resemble the real interrogator.
478.259	And so what these studies are showing
480.56	is that when you feed people misinformation
484.42	about some experience that they may have had,
487.8	you can distort or contaminate or change their memory.
493.455	Well out there in the real world,
495.655	misinformation is everywhere.
498.546	We get misinformation
499.906	not only if we're questioned in a leading way,
502.822	but if we talk to other witnesses
505.269	who might consciously or inadvertently feed us
508.302	some erroneous information,
510.439	or if we see media coverage about some event we might have experienced,
515.169	all of these provide the opportunity
517.962	for this kind of contamination of our memory.
522.312	In the 1990s, we began to see
526.1	an even more extreme kind of memory problem.
530.783	Some patients were going into therapy with one problem --
533.879	maybe they had depression, an eating disorder --
536.793	and they were coming out of therapy
539.546	with a different problem.
542.207	Extreme memories for horrific brutalizations,
545.908	sometimes in satanic rituals,
547.891	sometimes involving really bizarre and unusual elements.
552.588	One woman came out of psychotherapy
555.142	believing that she'd endured years
557.57	of ritualistic abuse, where she was forced into a pregnancy
561.472	and that the baby was cut from her belly.
564.038	But there were no physical scars
566.397	or any kind of physical evidence
568.423	that could have supported her story.
571.304	And when I began looking into these cases,
574.312	I was wondering,
575.762	where do these bizarre memories come from?
578.09	And what I found is that most of these situations
582.477	involved some particular form of psychotherapy.
587.968	And so I asked,
589.567	were some of the things going on in this psychotherapy --
592.955	like the imagination exercises
595.839	or dream interpretation,
597.896	or in some cases hypnosis,
600.028	or in some cases exposure to false information --
603.846	were these leading these patients
606.633	to develop these very bizarre,
609.31	unlikely memories?
612.241	And I designed some experiments
614.4	to try to study the processes that were being used
619.425	in this psychotherapy so I could study
622.498	the development of these very rich false memories.
626.049	In one of the first studies we did,
628.457	we used suggestion,
630.81	a method inspired by the psychotherapy we saw in these cases,
634.873	we used this kind of suggestion
636.983	and planted a false memory
638.835	that when you were a kid, five or six years old,
641.912	you were lost in a shopping mall.
644.163	You were frightened. You were crying.
646.663	You were ultimately rescued by an elderly person
649.177	and reunited with the family.
651.029	And we succeeded in planting this memory
653.637	in the minds of about a quarter of our subjects.
657.743	And you might be thinking, well,
659.748	that's not particularly stressful.
662.094	But we and other investigators have planted
665.463	rich false memories of things that were
668.221	much more unusual and much more stressful.
671.136	So in a study done in Tennessee,
673.675	researchers planted the false memory
676.091	that when you were a kid, you nearly drowned
678.665	and had to be rescued by a life guard.
681.172	And in a study done in Canada,
683.475	researchers planted the false memory
685.999	that when you were a kid,
687.227	something as awful as being attacked by a vicious animal
690.957	happened to you,
692.339	succeeding with about half of their subjects.
695.761	And in a study done in Italy,
698.113	researchers planted the false memory,
700.771	when you were a kid, you witnessed demonic possession.
705.983	I do want to add that it might seem
708.19	like we are traumatizing these experimental subjects
711.929	in the name of science,
713.529	but our studies have gone through thorough evaluation
718.167	by research ethics boards
720.142	that have made the decision
722.484	that the temporary discomfort that some
725.557	of these subjects might experience in these studies
728.641	is outweighed by the importance of this problem
732.541	for understanding memory processes
735.648	and the abuse of memory that is going on
738.994	in some places in the world.
742.287	Well, to my surprise,
745.325	when I published this work and began to speak out
748.754	against this particular brand of psychotherapy,
752.649	it created some pretty bad problems for me:
756.629	hostilities, primarily from the repressed memory therapists,
761.53	who felt under attack,
763.206	and by the patients whom they had influenced.
766.734	I had sometimes armed guards at speeches
769.671	that I was invited to give,
771.576	people trying to drum up letter-writing campaigns to get me fired.
775.793	But probably the worst
777.774	was I suspected that a woman
780.541	was innocent of abuse
782.965	that was being claimed by her grown daughter.
785.801	She accused her mother of sexual abuse
789.218	based on a repressed memory.
791.077	And this accusing daughter had actually allowed her story
793.96	to be filmed and presented in public places.
797.394	I was suspicious of this story,
799.903	and so I started to investigate,
802.203	and eventually found information that convinced me
806.686	that this mother was innocent.
808.975	I published an exposé on the case,
811.936	and a little while later, the accusing daughter
815.38	filed a lawsuit.
816.901	Even though I'd never mentioned her name,
819.256	she sued me for defamation and invasion of privacy.
823.618	And I went through nearly five years
826.341	of dealing with this messy, unpleasant litigation,
832.893	but finally, finally, it was over and I could really
836.567	get back to my work.
838.991	In the process, however, I became part
841.476	of a disturbing trend in America
844.13	where scientists are being sued
846.237	for simply speaking out on matters of great public controversy.
850.836	When I got back to my work, I asked this question:
854.194	if I plant a false memory in your mind,
856.592	does it have repercussions?
858.436	Does it affect your later thoughts,
860.395	your later behaviors?
862.496	Our first study planted a false memory
864.523	that you got sick as a child eating certain foods:
867.849	hard-boiled eggs, dill pickles, strawberry ice cream.
870.848	And we found that once we planted this false memory,
874.038	people didn't want to eat the foods as much
876.489	at an outdoor picnic.
878.749	The false memories aren't necessarily bad or unpleasant.
882.622	If we planted a warm, fuzzy memory
884.98	involving a healthy food like asparagus,
888.001	we could get people to want to eat asparagus more.
891.476	And so what these studies are showing
893.85	is that you can plant false memories
895.965	and they have repercussions
897.378	that affect behavior long after the memories take hold.
902.463	Well, along with this ability
904.887	to plant memories and control behavior
907.81	obviously come some important ethical issues,
911.991	like, when should we use this mind technology?
915.05	And should we ever ban its use?
918.73	Therapists can't ethically plant false memories
921.513	in the mind of their patients
923.1	even if it would help the patient,
925.664	but there's nothing to stop a parent
927.286	from trying this out on their overweight or obese teenager.
931.735	And when I suggested this publicly,
934.34	it created an outcry again.
937.686	"""There she goes. She's advocating that parents lie to their children."""
941.719	Hello, Santa Claus. (Laughter)
943.964	I mean, another way to think about this is,
953.461	which would you rather have,
955.494	a kid with obesity, diabetes, shortened lifespan,
958.523	all the things that go with it,
960.055	or a kid with one little extra bit of false memory?
963.071	I know what I would choose for a kid of mine.
966.462	But maybe my work has made me different from most people.
970.439	Most people cherish their memories,
972.518	know that they represent their identity,
974.672	who they are, where they came from.
976.697	And I appreciate that. I feel that way too.
979.555	But I know from my work
981.76	how much fiction is already in there.
986.241	If I've learned anything from these decades
988.973	of working on these problems, it's this:
991.383	just because somebody tells you something
993.594	and they say it with confidence,
995.169	just because they say it with lots of detail,
997.849	just because they express emotion when they say it,
1000.608	it doesn't mean that it really happened.
1003.81	We can't reliably distinguish true memories from false memories.
1007.675	We need independent corroboration.
1011.223	Such a discovery has made me more tolerant
1014.313	of the everyday memory mistakes
1016.452	that my friends and family members make.
1019.366	Such a discovery might have saved Steve Titus,
1023.9	the man whose whole future was snatched away
1027.476	by a false memory.
1029.714	But meanwhile, we should all keep in mind,
1032.53	we'd do well to,
1034.166	that memory, like liberty,
1038.037	is a fragile thing.
1041.731	Thank you. Thank you.
1044.669	Thank you. (Applause)
1047.397	Thanks very much. (Applause)
