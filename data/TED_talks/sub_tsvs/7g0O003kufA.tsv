26	"Hello. Actually, that's ""hello"" in Bauer Bodoni"
30	for the typographically hysterical amongst us.
33	One of the threads that seems to have come through
36	loud and clear in the last couple of days
39	is this need to reconcile what the Big wants --
43	"the ""Big"" being the organization, the system, the country --"
49	"and what the ""Small"" wants -- the individual, the person."
52	And how do you bring those two things together?
54	Charlie Ledbetter, yesterday, I thought, talked very articulately
56	about this need to bring consumers, to bring people
60	into the process of creating things.
62	And that's what I want to talk about today.
65	So, bringing together the Small to help facilitate and create the Big,
71	I think, is something that we believe in -- something I believe in,
74	and something that we kind of bring to life
76	through what we do at Ideo.
79	I call this first chapter -- for the Brits in the room --
81	"the ""Blinding Glimpse of the Bleeding Obvious."""
83	Often, the good ideas are so staring-at-you-right-in-the-face
87	that you kind of miss them. And I think, a lot of times,
90	what we do is just, sort of, hold the mirror up to our clients, and sort of go,
93	"""Duh! You know, look what's really going on."""
96	And rather than talk about it in the theory,
98	I think I'm just going to show you an example.
100	We were asked by a large healthcare system in Minnesota
105	to describe to them what their patient experience was.
108	And I think they were expecting --
110	they'd worked with lots of consultants before --
111	I think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chart
114	with thousands of bubbles and systemic this, that and the other,
118	and all kinds of mappy stuff.
120	Or even worse, some kind of ghastly death-by-Powerpoint thing
124	with WowCharts and all kinds of, you know, God knows, whatever.
128	The first thing we actually shared with them was this.
134	I'll play this until your eyeballs completely dissolve.
138	This is 59 seconds into the film.
144	This is a minute 59.
149	3:19.
150	I think something happens. I think a head may appear in a second.
154	5:10.
156	5:58.
158	6:20.
160	We showed them the whole cut,
161	and they were all completely, what is this?
164	And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day,
175	all you do is look at the roof, and it's a really shitty experience.
179	And just putting yourself in the position of the patient --
183	this is Christian, who works with us at Ideo.
185	He just lay in the hospital bed,
186	and, kind of, stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles
189	for a really long time.
190	That's what it's like to be a patient in the hospital.
193	And they were sort, you know, blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious.
196	Oh, my goodness. So, looking at the situation
199	from the point of view of the person out --
202	as opposed to the traditional position of the organization in --
206	was, for these guys, quite a revelation.
209	And so, that was a really catalytic thing for them.
213	So they snapped into action.
214	They said, OK, it's not about systemic change.
217	It's not about huge, ridiculous things that we need to do.
219	It's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference.
222	So we started with them prototyping some really little things
226	that we could do to have a huge amount of impact.
228	The first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror
232	and we Band-Aided it here, onto a gurney, a hospital trolley,
237	so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor,
241	you could actually have a conversation with them.
242	You could, kind of, see them in your rear-view mirror,
244	so it created a tiny human interaction.
247	Very small example of something that they could do.
250	Interestingly, the nurses themselves, sort of, snapped into action --
253	said, OK, we embrace this. What can we do?
256	The first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling.
259	Which I thought was really -- I showed this to my mother recently.
261	I think my mother now thinks that I'm some sort of interior decorator.
264	It's what I do for a living, sort of Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen.
267	Not particularly the world's best design solution
269	for those of us who are real, sort of, hard-core designers,
271	but nonetheless, a fabulous empathic solution for people.
277	Things that they started doing themselves --
279	like changing the floor going into the patient's room
282	"so that it signified, ""This is my room. This is my personal space"" --"
287	was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem.
289	So you went from public space to private space.
291	And another idea, again, that came from one of the nurses -- which I love --
294	was they took traditional, sort of, corporate white boards,
298	then they put them on one wall of the patient's room,
300	and they put this sticker there.
302	So that what you could actually do was go into the room
305	and write messages to the person who was sick in that room,
308	which was lovely.
309	So, tiny, tiny, tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact.
314	I thought that was a really, really nice example.
318	So this is not particularly a new idea,
320	kind of, seeing opportunities in things that are around you
324	and snapping and turning them into a solution.
326	It's a history of invention based around this.
329	I'm going to read this because I want to get these names right.
331	Joan Ganz Cooney saw her daughter -- came down on a Saturday morning,
335	saw her daughter watching the test card,
337	waiting for programs to come on one morning
340	and from that came Sesame Street.
344	Malcolm McLean was moving from one country to another
348	and was wondering why it took these guys so long
350	to get the boxes onto the ship.
353	And he invented the shipping container.
356	George de Mestral -- this is not bugs all over a Birkenstock --
360	was walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs,
363	sort of little prickly things, and from that came Velcro.
370	And finally, for the Brits, Percy Shaw -- this is a big British invention --
375	saw the cat's eyes at the side of the road,
376	when he was driving home one night and from that came the Catseye.
381	So there's a whole series of just using your eyes,
383	seeing things for the first time, seeing things afresh
386	and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities.
390	Second one, without sounding overly Zen,
392	and this is a quote from the Buddha:
394	"""Finding yourself in the margins, looking to the edges of things,"
398	"is often a really interesting place to start."""
401	Blinkered vision tends to produce, I think, blinkered solutions.
405	So, looking wide, using your peripheral vision,
408	is a really interesting place to look for opportunity.
411	Again, another medical example here.
414	We were asked by a device producer --
417	we did the Palm Pilot and the Treo.
419	We did a lot of sexy tech at Ideo --
421	they'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology
424	for medical diagnostics.
426	This was a device that a nurse uses
428	when they're doing a spinal procedure in hospital.
430	They'll ask the nurses to input data.
432	And they had this vision of the nurse, kind of, clicking away
434	on this aluminum device
435	and it all being incredibly, sort of, gadget-lustish.
440	When we actually went and watched this procedure taking place --
444	and I'll explain this in a second --
446	it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this
450	that they really weren't recognizing.
453	When you're having a four-inch needle inserted into your spine --
457	which was the procedure that this device's data was about;
461	it was for pain management -- you're shit scared; you're freaking out.
465	And so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did,
469	was hold the patient's hand to comfort them. Human gesture --
473	which made the fabulous two-handed data input completely impossible.
479	So, the thing that we designed, much less sexy
483	but much more human and practical, was this.
488	So, it's not a Palm Pilot by any stretch of the imagination,
490	but it has a thumb-scroll so you can do everything with one hand.
493	So, again, going back to this -- the idea that a tiny human gesture
499	dictated the design of this product.
502	And I think that's really, really important.
505	So, again, this idea of workarounds.
507	"We use this phrase ""workarounds"" a lot,"
509	sort of, looking around us. I was actually looking around the TED
511	and just watching all of these kind of things happen
513	while I've been here.
514	This idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life --
518	and the things we kind of do in our environment
521	that are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential --
523	is something that we look at a lot.
525	We wrote a book recently, I think you might have received it,
528	"called ""Thoughtless Acts?"""
529	It's been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do,
532	which have huge intention and huge opportunity.
535	Why do we all follow the line in the street?
538	This is a picture in a Japanese subway.
540	People consciously follow things even though, why, we don't know.
546	Why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence?
550	Because we kind of have to -- we're just compelled to.
554	We don't know why, but we do.
558	Why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle?
561	Again, we're sort of using the world around us
564	to create our own design solutions.
566	"And we're always saying to our clients: ""You should look at this stuff."
569	"This stuff is really important. This stuff is really vital."""
571	This is people designing their own experiences.
573	You can draw from this.
577	We sort of assume that because there's a pole in the street,
579	that it's okay to use it, so we park our shopping cart there.
584	It's there for our use, on some level.
586	So, again, we sort of co-opt our environment
588	to do all these different things.
591	We co-opt other experiences --
592	we take one item and transfer it to another.
596	And this is my favorite one. My mother used to say to me,
598	"""Just because your sister jumps in the lake doesn't mean you have to."""
601	But, of course, we all do. We all follow each other every day.
603	So somebody assumes
604	that because somebody else has done something,
606	that's permission for them to do the same thing.
609	And there's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time.
612	"I mean, shopping bag equals ""parking meter out of order."""
615	And we all, kind of, know how to read these signals now.
617	We all talk to one another in this highly visual way
620	without realizing what we're doing.
623	Third section is this idea of not knowing,
627	of consciously putting yourself backwards.
629	I talk about unthinking situations all the time.
632	Sort of having beginner's mind, scraping your mind clean
634	and looking at things afresh.
636	A friend of mine was a designer at IKEA,
639	and he was asked by his boss
641	to help design a storage system for children.
644	This is the Billy bookcase -- it's IKEA's biggest selling product.
647	Hammer it together. Hammer it together with a shoe, if you're me,
649	because they're impossible to assemble.
651	But big selling bookcase. How do we replicate this for children?
657	The reality is when you actually watch children,
660	children don't think about things like storage in linear terms.
663	Children assume permission in a very different way.
666	Children live on things. They live under things.
668	They live around things,
670	and so their spatial awareness relationship,
673	and their thinking around storage is totally different.
675	So the first thing you have to do -- this is Graham, the designer --
678	is, sort of, put yourself in their shoes. And so, here he is
681	sitting under the table.
683	So, what came out of this?
685	This is the storage system that he designed.
688	So what is this? I hear you all ask. No, I don't.
691	(Laughter)
693	It's this, and I think this is a particularly lovely solution.
697	So, you know, it's a totally different way of looking at the situation.
700	It's a completely empathic solution --
704	apart from the fact that teddy's probably not loving it.
706	(Laughter)
710	But a really nice way of re-framing the ordinary,
715	and I think that's one of the things.
716	And putting yourself in the position of the person,
719	and I think that's one of the threads that I've heard again
721	from this conference is how do we put ourselves
723	in other peoples' shoes and really feel what they feel?
725	And then use that information to fuel solutions?
728	And I think that's what this is very much about.
732	Last section: green armband. We've all got them.
736	It's about this really.
738	I mean, it's about picking battles big enough to matter
740	but small enough to win.
742	Again, that's one of the themes
743	that I think has come through loud and clear in this conference
746	is: Where do we start? How do we start? What do we do to start?
750	So, again, we were asked to design a water pump
754	for a company called ApproTEC, in Kenya.
756	They're now called KickStart.
759	And, again, as designers,
760	we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful
762	and spend a lot of time thinking of the form.
765	And that was completely irrelevant.
766	When you put yourself in the position of these people,
771	things like the fact that this has to be able to fold up
773	and fit on a bicycle, become much more relevant
776	than the form of it. The way it's produced,
778	it has to be produced with indigenous manufacturing methods
781	and indigenous materials.
783	So it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user.
787	We had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world.
791	So what seems like a very clunky product
793	is, in fact, incredibly useful.
796	It's powered a bit like a Stairmaster -- you pump up and down on it.
799	Children can use it. Adults can use it. Everybody uses it.
802	It's turning these guys -- again, one of the themes --
805	it's turning them into entrepreneurs.
808	These guys are using this very successfully.
810	And for us, it's been great
811	because it's won loads of design awards.
812	So we actually managed to reconcile the needs of the design company,
815	the needs of the individuals in the company,
817	to feel good about a product we were actually designing,
819	and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for.
824	There it is, pumping water from 30 feet.
828	So as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets
833	to all of you this morning.
834	We've made a donation on everybody's behalf here
837	to kick start, no pun intended, their next project.
841	Because, again, I think, sort of, putting our money where our mouth is, here.
845	We feel that this is an important gesture.
847	So we've handed out bracelets. Small is the new big.
849	I hope you'll all wear them.
850	So that's it. Thank you.
853	(Applause)
