12.552	Dre Urhahn: This theater 
12.552	is built on Copacabana,
15.38	which is the most famous 
15.38	beach in the world,
18.483	but 25 kilometers away from here
20.281	in the North Zone of Rio
22.297	lies a community called Vila Cruzeiro,
25.359	and roughly 60,000 people live there.
28.419	Now, the people here in Rio mostly know
30.522	Vila Cruzeiro from the news,
32.397	and unfortunately, news 
32.397	from Vila Cruzeiro often
36.034	is not good news.
38.466	But Vila Cruzeiro is also the place
41.367	where our story begins.
43.392	Jeroen Koolhaas: Ten years 
43.392	ago, we first came to Rio
46.165	to shoot a documentary 
46.165	about life in the favelas.
49.792	Now, we learned that favelas 
49.792	are informal communities.
52.694	They emerged over the years
53.911	when immigrants from the countryside
55.771	came to the cities looking for work,
57.783	like cities within the cities,
60.029	known for problems like crime, poverty,
62.595	and the violent drug war between
64.356	police and the drug gangs.
65.768	So what struck us was that
69.013	these were communities that the people
70.57	who lived there had built 
70.57	with their own hands,
73.05	without a master plan
74.6	and like a giant work in progress.
77.5	Where we're from, in Holland,
79.374	everything is planned.
81.457	We even have rules for 
81.457	how to follow the rules.
84.121	(Laughter)
85.677	DU: So the last day of 
85.677	filming, we ended up
87.795	in Vila Cruzeiro, and 
87.795	we were sitting down
89.944	and we had a drink,
91.332	and we were overlooking this hill
93.007	with all these houses,
94.617	and most of these houses looked unfinished,
96.952	and they had walls of bare brick,
98.382	but we saw some of these houses
100.132	which were plastered and painted,
102.074	and suddenly we had this idea:
103.77	what would it look like if all these houses
106.45	would be plastered and painted?
108.625	And then we imagined one big design,
111.667	one big work of art.
114.767	Who would expect something like that
116.423	in a place like this?
118.289	So we thought, would that even be possible?
121.452	So first we started to count the houses,
124.14	but we soon lost count.
126.038	But somehow the idea stuck.
129.234	JK: We had a friend.
130.909	He ran an NGO in Vila Cruzeiro.
133.52	His name was Nanko,
134.805	and he also liked the idea.
136.866	"He said, ""You know, everybody here"
138.538	would pretty much love 
138.538	to have their houses
140.411	plastered and painted.
141.862	"It's when a house is finished."""
144.097	So he introduced us to the right people,
146.066	and Vitor and Maurinho became our crew.
149.097	We picked three houses in
149.097	the center of the community
152.014	and we start here. We made a few designs,
154.494	and everybody liked this design
156.114	of a boy flying a kite the best.
158.527	So we started painting, 
158.527	and the first thing we did
160.668	was to paint everything blue,
163.059	and we thought that looked 
163.059	already pretty good.
165.65	But they hated it. The people
165.65	who lived there really hated it.
168.181	"They said, ""What did you do?"
169.824	You painted our house in 
169.824	exactly the same color
171.713	"as the police station."""
173.513	(Laughter)
175.426	In a favela, that is not a good thing.
177.652	Also the same color as the prison cell.
181.477	So we quickly went ahead 
181.477	and we painted the boy,
184.931	and then we thought we were finished,
186.139	we were really happy, but still,
188.676	it wasn't good because the little
188.676	kids started coming up to us,
191.069	"and they said, ""You know, "
191.069	there's a boy flying the kite,
193.131	"but where is his kite?"""
195.178	"We said, ""Uh, it's art."
197.293	"You know, you have to imagine the kite."""
199.81	(Laughter)
200.862	"And they said, ""No, no, no, "
200.862	"we want to see the kite."""
204.526	So we quickly installed a kite
206.423	way up high on the hill,
207.788	so that you could see 
207.788	the boy flying the kite
209.92	and you could actually see a kite.
212.333	So the local news started writing about it,
214.188	which was great,
215.501	and then even The Guardian wrote about it:
217.088	"""Notorious slum becomes open-air gallery."""
221.264	JK: So, encouraged by this success,
224.182	we went back to Rio for a second project,
227.71	and we stumbled upon this street.
230.336	It was covered in concrete 
230.336	to prevent mudslides,
233.609	and somehow we saw a sort of river in it,
236.96	and we imagined this river
236.96	to be a river in Japanese style
240.444	with koi carp swimming upstream.
243.19	So we decided to paint that river,
245.291	and we invited Rob Admiraal,
247.913	who is a tattoo artist,
249.313	and he specialized in the Japanese style.
252.333	So little did we know that we would spend
254.02	almost an entire year painting that river,
257.455	together with Geovani
257.455	and Robinho and Vitor,
261.175	who lived nearby.
263.301	And we even moved into the neighborhood
265.371	when one of the guys that 
265.371	lived on the street, Elias,
268.734	told us that we could come 
268.734	and live in his house,
271.659	together with his family,
273.007	which was fantastic.
274.477	Unfortunately, during that time,
275.805	another war broke out between the police
278.086	and the drug gangs.
279.861	(Video) (Gunfire)
294.218	We learned that during those times,
297.124	people in communities 
297.124	really stick together
299.494	during these times of hardship,
301.282	but we also learned a 
301.282	very important element,
303.892	the importance of barbecues. 
303.892	(Laughter)
307.199	Because, when you throw a barbecue,
308.92	it turns you from a guest into a host,
311.361	so we decided to throw one
312.574	almost every other week,
313.797	and we got to know everybody 
313.797	in the neighborhood.
316.806	JK: We still had this 
316.806	idea of the hill, though.
318.831	DU: Yeah, yeah, we were talking about
320.191	the scale of this, because this painting
322.137	was incredibly big,
324.398	and it was insanely detailed,
326.546	and this process almost drove
326.546	us completely insane ourselves.
332.285	But we figured that maybe, 
332.285	during this process,
335.48	all the time that we had 
335.48	spent in the neighborhood
337.651	was maybe actually even more important
339.225	than the painting itself.
341.926	JK: So after all that time,
343.444	this hill, this idea was still there,
345.873	and we started to make sketches,
348.258	models, and we figured something out.
351.442	We figured that our ideas, our designs
353.545	had to be a little bit more simple than that last project
357.314	so that we could paint with more people
359.458	and cover more houses at the same time.
363.114	And we had an opportunity to try that out
365.47	in a community in the central part of Rio,
368.04	which is called Santa Marta,
369.788	and we made a design for this place
371.971	which looked like this,
373.362	and then we got people to go along with it
374.907	because turns out that if 
374.907	your idea is ridiculously big,
378.93	it's easier to get people to 
378.93	go along with this. (Laughter)
382.5	And the people of Santa Marta
385.468	got together and in a little over a month
388.216	they turned that square into this.
390.589	(Applause)
397.676	And this image somehow 
397.676	went all over the world.
400.87	DU: So then we received 
400.87	an unexpected phone call
404.638	from the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program,
408.305	and they had this question
409.88	if this idea, our approach,
411.781	if this would actually 
411.781	work in North Philly,
414.695	which is one of the poorest neighborhoods
417.126	in the United States.
418.778	So we immediately said yes.
421.838	We had no idea how,
423.748	but it seemed like a very 
423.748	interesting challenge,
426.169	so we did exactly the 
426.169	same as we did in Rio,
428.43	and we moved into the neighborhood
430.101	and started barbecuing.
432.243	(Laughter)
437.102	So the project took almost two years to complete,
440.871	and we made individual designs
442.761	for every single house on 
442.761	the avenue that we painted,
445.304	and we made these designs together
446.908	with the local store owners, 
446.908	the building owners,
449.521	and a team of about a dozen 
449.521	young men and women.
454.459	They were hired, and then
454.459	they were trained as painters,
457.958	and together they transformed
457.958	their own neighborhood,
461.523	the whole street, into a 
461.523	giant patchwork of color.
466.34	(Applause)
472.142	And at the end, the city of Philadelphia
475.765	thanked every single one of them
477.778	and gave them a merit for
477.778	their accomplishment.
481.094	JK: So now we had painted a whole street.
484.246	How about we do this whole hill now?
487.801	We started looking for funding,
489.679	but instead, we just ran into questions,
492.92	like, how many houses 
492.92	are you going to paint?
496.339	How many square meters is that?
498.495	How much paint are you going to use,
500.546	and how many people are you going to employ?
503.189	And we did try for years to write plans
505.9	for the funding and answer 
505.9	all those questions,
509.219	but then we thought,
510.759	in order to answer all those questions,
512.672	you have to know exactly 
512.672	what you're going to do
515.259	before you actually get there and start.
518.443	And maybe it's a mistake 
518.443	to think like that.
521.694	It would lose some of the 
521.694	magic that we had learned
524.222	about that if you go somewhere
525.848	and you spend time there,
528.263	you can let the project grow organically
530.231	and have a life of its own.
533.719	DU: So what we did is
535.931	we decided to take this 
535.931	plan and strip it away
539.14	from all the numbers
541.03	and all the ideas and presumptions
542.999	and just go back to the base idea,
545.362	which was to transform this hill
547.364	into a giant work of art.
549.805	And instead of looking for funding,
552.207	we started a crowdfunding campaign,
555.097	and in a little over a month,
556.68	more than 1,500 people put together
558.852	and donated over 100,000 dollars.
562.127	So for us, this was an amazing 
562.127	moment, because now —
565.73	(Applause)&nbsp;—
569.246	because now we finally had the freedom
572.295	to use all the lessons that we had learned
574.466	and create a project that was built
577.562	the same way that the favela was built,
579.474	from the ground on up, bottom up,
581.128	with no master plan.
583.703	JK: So we went back, 
583.703	and we employed Angelo,
586.8	and he's a local artist from Vila Cruzeiro,
588.722	very talented guy, and he
588.722	knows almost everybody there,
591.518	and then we employed Elias, our former landlord
593.94	who invited us into his house,
595.537	and he's a master of construction.
597.551	Together with them, we decided where to start.
599.992	We picked this spot in Vila Cruzeiro,
601.678	and houses are being plastered as we speak.
604.491	And the good thing about them is that
606.071	they are deciding which houses go next.
608.066	They're even printing t-shirts,
609.752	they're putting up banners
611.318	explaining everything to everybody,
613.302	and talking to the press.
615.143	This article about Angelo appeared.
617.61	DU: So while this is happening,
618.788	we are bringing this 
618.788	idea all over the world.
620.973	So, like the project we 
620.973	did in Philadelphia,
624.29	we are also invited to do workshops,
626.438	for instance in Curaçao,
628.35	and right now we're planning 
628.35	a huge project in Haiti.
632.456	JK: So the favela was not only the place
635.2	where this idea started:
636.787	it was also the place that made it possible
640.342	to work without a master plan,
643.468	because these communities are informal —
645.538	this was the inspiration —
646.977	and in a communal effort, 
646.977	together with the people,
649.577	you can almost work like in an orchestra,
651.488	where you can have a hundred instruments
653.062	playing together to create a symphony.
655.415	DU: So we want to thank everybody who
657.372	wanted to become part of this dream
658.99	and supported us along the way,
661.174	and we are looking at continuing.
663.885	JK: Yeah. And so one day pretty soon,
665.696	when the colors start 
665.696	going up on these walls,
668.205	we hope more people will join us,
670.184	and join this big dream,
672.997	and maybe one day, the 
672.997	whole of Vila Cruzeiro
675.617	will be painted.
677.372	DU: Thank you.
679.284	(Applause)
