12.785	So on my way here,
15.84	the passenger next to me and I
15.84	had a very interesting conversation
19.542	during my flight.
21.585	"He told me, ""It seems like"
21.585	the United States has run out of jobs,
26.113	because they're just making some up:
28.481	cat psychologist, dog whisperer,
28.481	"tornado chaser."""
34.743	A couple of seconds later, he asked me,
37.56	"""So what do you do?"""
39.812	"And I was like, ""Peacebuilder?"""
42.505	(Laughter)
46.925	Every day, I work to amplify
46.925	the voices of women
51.352	and to highlight their experiences
54.45	and their participation in peace
54.45	processes and conflict resolution,
59.509	and because of my work,
62.288	I recognize that the only way to ensure
62.288	the full participation of women globally
68.464	is by reclaiming religion.
71.33	Now, this matter is vitally
71.33	important to me.
75.394	As a young Muslim woman,
75.394	I am very proud of my faith.
79.805	It gives me the strength and conviction
79.805	to do my work every day.
84.54	It's the reason I can be here
84.54	in front of you.
87.909	But I can't overlook the damage that has
87.909	been done in the name of religion,
93.133	not just my own, but all
93.133	of the world's major faiths.
97.661	The misrepresentation and misuse
97.661	and manipulation of religious scripture
102.165	has influenced our social
102.165	and cultural norms,
105.694	our laws, our daily lives,
108.62	to a point where we sometimes
108.62	don't recognize it.
112.804	My parents moved from Libya,
112.804	North Africa, to Canada
117.49	in the early 1980s,
119.254	and I am the middle child of 11 children.
123.1	Yes, 11.
125.431	But growing up, I saw my parents,
127.589	both religiously devout
127.589	and spiritual people,
131.165	pray and praise God for their blessings,
133.905	namely me of course, but among others.
133.905	(Laughter)
138.664	They were kind and funny and patient,
141.822	limitlessly patient, the kind of patience
141.822	that having 11 kids forces you to have.
148.161	And they were fair.
150.181	I was never subjected to religion
150.181	through a cultural lens.
154.895	I was treated the same,
156.961	the same was expected of me.
159.74	I was never taught that God
159.74	judged differently based on gender.
164.647	And my parents' understanding of God
164.647	as a merciful and beneficial friend
170.289	and provider shaped the way
170.289	I looked at the world.
174.143	Now, of course, my upbringing
174.143	had additional benefits.
178.97	Being one of 11 children is Diplomacy 101.
178.97	(Laughter)
184.592	To this day, I am asked
184.592	where I went to school,
187.169	"like, ""Did you go to"
187.169	"Kennedy School of Government?"""
189.652	"and I look at them and I'm like, ""No,"
191.558	I went to the Murabit School
191.558	"of International Affairs."""
194.367	It's extremely exclusive. You would have
194.367	to talk to my mom to get in.
200.195	Lucky for you, she's here.
203.879	But being one of 11 children
203.879	and having 10 siblings
208.368	teaches you a lot about
208.368	power structures and alliances.
212.6	It teaches you focus; you have
212.6	to talk fast or say less,
215.403	because you will always get cut off.
217.911	It teaches you the importance
217.911	of messaging.
220.767	You have to ask questions in the right way
220.767	to get the answers you know you want,
224.993	and you have to say no
224.993	in the right way to keep the peace.
229.172	But the most important lesson
229.172	I learned growing up
233.444	was the importance of being at the table.
236.974	When my mom's favorite lamp broke,
236.974	I had to be there when she was trying
240.805	to find out how and by who,
240.805	because I had to defend myself,
245.334	because if you're not,
245.334	then the finger is pointed at you,
249.117	and before you know it,
249.117	you will be grounded.
251.741	I am not speaking
251.741	from experience, of course.
256.338	When I was 15 in 2005,
256.338	I completed high school and I moved
261.75	from Canada -- Saskatoon --
264.24	to Zawiya, my parents' hometown in Libya,
268.319	a very traditional city.
270.711	Mind you, I had only ever been
270.711	to Libya before on vacation,
275.53	and as a seven-year-old girl,
275.53	it was magic.
279.906	It was ice cream and trips to the beach
279.906	and really excited relatives.
285.468	Turns out it's not the same
285.468	as a 15-year-old young lady.
290.47	I very quickly became introduced
290.47	to the cultural aspect of religion.
296.438	"The words ""haram"" --"
296.438	meaning religiously prohibited --
300.896	"and ""aib"" -- meaning"
300.896	culturally inappropriate --
304.402	were exchanged carelessly,
307.118	as if they meant the same thing
307.118	and had the same consequences.
311.437	And I found myself in conversation
311.437	after conversation with classmates
316.174	and colleagues, professors,
316.174	friends, even relatives,
319.61	beginning to question my own role
319.61	and my own aspirations.
324.393	And even with the foundation
324.393	my parents had provided for me,
327.923	I found myself questioning
327.923	the role of women in my faith.
332.218	So at the Murabit School
332.218	of International Affairs,
336.397	we go very heavy on the debate,
339.137	and rule number one is do your research,
339.137	so that's what I did,
344.64	and it surprised me how easy it was
348.425	to find women in my faith
348.425	who were leaders,
352.442	who were innovative, who were strong --
355.994	politically, economically,
355.994	even militarily.
359.36	Khadija financed the Islamic movement
362.751	in its infancy.
364.562	We wouldn't be here if it weren't for her.
367.627	So why weren't we learning about her?
370.274	Why weren't we learning about these women?
373.195	Why were women being relegated
373.195	to positions which predated
375.986	the teachings of our faith?
378.656	And why, if we are equal
378.656	in the eyes of God,
380.931	are we not equal in the eyes of men?
384.623	To me, it all came back to the lessons
384.623	I had learned as a child.
390.35	The decision maker, the person
390.35	who gets to control the message,
394.022	is sitting at the table,
396.604	and unfortunately,
396.604	in every single world faith,
401.504	they are not women.
404.15	Religious institutions
404.15	are dominated by men
407.192	and driven by male leadership,
409.143	and they create policies
409.143	in their likeness,
412.579	and until we can change
412.579	the system entirely,
416.672	then we can't realistically
416.672	expect to have full economic
419.939	and political participation of women.
423.515	Our foundation is broken.
427.786	My mom actually says, you can't build
427.786	a straight house on a crooked foundation.
434.521	In 2011, the Libyan revolution broke out,
434.521	and my family was on the front lines.
441.58	And there's this amazing thing
441.58	that happens in war,
444.644	a cultural shift almost, very temporary.
447.773	And it was the first time that I felt
447.773	it was not only acceptable
450.844	for me to be involved,
450.844	but it was encouraged.
453.816	It was demanded.
456.161	Myself and other women
456.161	had a seat at the table.
459.17	We weren't holding hands or a medium.
462.569	We were part of decision making.
464.427	We were information sharing.
464.427	We were crucial.
467.84	And I wanted and needed
467.84	for that change to be permanent.
474.342	Turns out, that's not that easy.
477.128	It only took a few weeks before the women
477.128	that I had previously worked with
481.5	were returning back
481.5	to their previous roles,
484.47	and most of them were driven
484.47	by words of encouragement
487.275	from religious and political leaders,
490.177	most of whom cited religious scripture
490.177	as their defense.
494.449	It's how they gained popular support
494.449	for their opinions.
499.08	So initially, I focused on the economic
499.08	and political empowerment of women.
504.317	I thought that would lead
504.317	to cultural and social change.
507.823	It turns out, it does a little,
507.823	but not a lot.
512.165	I decided to use
512.165	their defense as my offense,
516.53	and I began to cite and highlight
516.53	Islamic scripture as well.
521.174	In 2012 and 2013, my organization
521.174	led the single largest
525.736	and most widespread
525.736	campaign in Libya.
528.221	We entered homes and schools
528.221	and universities, even mosques.
532.997	We spoke to 50,000 people directly,
535.279	and hundreds of thousands more through
535.279	billboards and television commercials,
539.343	radio commercials and posters.
542.13	And you're probably wondering how
542.13	a women's rights organization
545.194	was able to do this in communities
545.194	which had previously opposed
548.166	our sheer existence.
551.701	I used scripture.
554.17	I used verses from the Quran
554.17	and sayings of the Prophet,
559.56	Hadiths, his sayings which
559.56	are, for example,
563.525	"""The best of you is the best"
563.525	"to their family."""
566.961	"""Do not let your brother oppress another."""
570.978	For the first time, Friday sermons
570.978	led by local community imams
575.993	promoted the rights of women.
578.478	They discussed taboo issues,
578.478	like domestic violence.
582.656	Policies were changed.
586.08	In certain communities,
586.08	we actually had to go as far
589.205	as saying the International
589.205	Human Rights Declaration,
593.106	which you opposed because it wasn't
593.106	written by religious scholars,
597.192	well, those same principles
597.192	are in our book.
601.975	So really, the United Nations
601.975	just copied us.
607.931	By changing the message,
607.931	we were able to provide
610.774	an alternative narrative which promoted
610.774	the rights of women in Libya.
615.349	It's something that has now
615.349	been replicated internationally,
620.201	and while I am not saying it's easy --
620.201	believe me, it's not.
624.59	Liberals will say you're using religion
624.59	and call you a bad conservative.
628.421	Conservatives will call you
628.421	a lot of colorful things.
631.904	"I've heard everything from, ""Your parents"
631.904	"must be extremely ashamed of you"" --"
635.99	false; they're my biggest fans --
638.1	"to ""You will not make it"
638.1	"to your next birthday"" --"
640.611	again wrong, because I did.
644.674	And I remain
646.81	a very strong believer that women's rights
646.81	and religion are not mutually exclusive.
654.291	But we have to be at the table.
657.723	We have to stop giving up our position,
657.723	because by remaining silent,
661.856	we allow for the continued persecution
661.856	and abuse of women worldwide.
667.837	By saying that we're going
667.837	to fight for women's rights
670.842	and fight extremism
670.842	with bombs and warfare,
674.627	we completely cripple local societies
674.627	which need to address these issues
678.876	so that they're sustainable.
683.496	It is not easy, challenging
683.496	distorted religious messaging.
688.93	You will have your fair share
688.93	of insults and ridicule and threats.
694.38	But we have to do it.
696.216	We have no other option than to reclaim
696.216	the message of human rights,
700.957	the principles of our faith,
703.604	not for us, not for
703.604	the women in your families,
706.367	not for the women in this room,
708.317	not even for the women out there,
711.491	but for societies
711.491	that would be transformed
714.997	with the participation of women.
717.884	And the only way we can do that,
720.391	our only option,
722.179	is to be, and remain, at the table.
725.709	Thank you.
728.332	(Applause)
