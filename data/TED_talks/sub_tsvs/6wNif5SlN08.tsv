12.764	I remember when I first found out
14.686	I was going to speak at a TED conference.
16.749	I ran across the hall
16.749	to one of my classrooms
18.884	to inform my students.
20.337	"""Guess what, guys?"
21.609	"I've been asked to give a TED Talk."""
23.711	The reaction wasn't one I quite expected.
25.766	The whole room went silent.
28.954	"""A TED Talk? You mean, like the one"
28.954	you made us watch on grit?
31.938	Or the one with the scientist that did
31.938	"this really awesome thing with robots?"""
35.657	Muhammad asked.
36.847	"""Yes, just like that."""
38.957	"""But Coach, those people"
38.957	"are really important and smart."""
41.915	(Laughter)
44.016	"""I know that."""
46.613	"""But Coach, why are you speaking?"
46.613	"You hate public speaking."""
50.891	"""I do,"" I admitted,"
54.154	"""But it's important that I speak about us,"
54.154	that I speak about your journeys,
57.777	about my journey.
58.96	"People need to know."""
60.918	The students at the all-refugee
60.918	school that I founded
63.655	decided to end with some
63.655	words of encouragement.
66.071	"""Cool! It better be good, Coach."""
67.914	(Laughter)
70.638	There are 65.3 million people
70.638	who have been forcibly displaced
74.22	from their homes because
74.22	of war or persecution.
77.855	The largest number,
88.666	The vast majority remain in refugee camps,
91.888	whose conditions cannot be defined
91.888	as humane under anyone's definition.
96.506	We are participating
96.506	in the degradation of humans.
104.57	Never have we had numbers this high.
106.375	This is the highest number
106.375	of refugees since World War II.
110.235	Now, let me tell you why this issue
110.235	is so important to me.
113.964	I am an Arab. I am an immigrant.
117.844	I am a Muslim.
119.826	I've also spent the last 12 years
119.826	of my life working with refugees.
123.624	Oh -- and I'm also gay.
125.09	It makes me really popular these days.
127.014	(Laughter)
128.929	But I am the daughter of a refugee.
131.876	My grandmother fled Syria in 1964
131.876	during the first Assad regime.
136.398	She was three months pregnant
136.398	when she packed up a suitcase,
139.869	piled in her five children
139.869	and drove to neighboring Jordan,
142.987	not knowing what the future held
142.987	for her and her family.
146.023	My grandfather decided to stay,
146.023	not believing it was that bad.
150.382	He followed her a month later,
150.382	after his brothers were tortured
153.88	and his factory was taken over
153.88	by the government.
156.859	They rebuilt their lives
156.859	starting from scratch
159.077	and eventually became independently
159.077	wealthy Jordanian citizens.
163.789	I was born in Jordan 11 years later.
167.251	It was really important to my grandmother
167.251	for us to know our history
170.585	and our journey.
172.703	I was eight years old when she took me
172.703	to visit my first refugee camp.
176.344	I didn't understand why.
178.456	I didn't know why
178.456	it was so important to her
180.611	for us to go.
182.085	I remember walking into the camp
182.085	holding her hand,
185.048	"and her saying, ""Go play with the kids,"""
187.041	while she visited
187.041	with the women in the camp.
190.426	I didn't want to.
191.662	These kids weren't like me.
193.102	They were poor. They lived in a camp.
194.904	I refused.
196.268	She knelt down beside me
196.268	"and firmly said, ""Go."
199.258	And don't come back until you've played.
201.436	Don't ever think people are beneath you
203.5	or that you have nothing
203.5	"to learn from others."""
206.34	I reluctantly went.
207.813	I never wanted to disappoint
207.813	my grandmother.
211.295	I returned a few hours later,
212.716	having spent some time playing soccer
212.716	with the kids in the camp.
217.859	We walked out of the camp,
219.16	and I was excitedly telling her
219.16	what a great time I had
221.879	and how fantastic the kids were.
224.995	"""Haram!"" I said in Arabic. ""Poor them."""
228.468	"""Haram on us,"" she said,"
228.468	using the word's different meaning,
231.579	that we were sinning.
233.822	"""Don't feel sorry for them;"
233.822	"believe in them."""
238.171	It wasn't until I left my country
238.171	of origin for the United States
241.614	that I realized the impact of her words.
245.007	After my college graduation, I applied for
245.007	and was granted political asylum,
248.705	based on being a member of a social group.
251.53	Some people may not realize this,
253.244	but you can still get the death penalty
253.244	in some countries for being gay.
258.897	I had to give up my Jordanian citizenship.
260.965	That was the hardest decision
260.965	I've ever had to make,
263.438	but I had no other choice.
269.207	The point is,
271.326	when you find yourself choosing
271.326	between home and survival,
274.426	"the question ""Where are you from?"""
274.426	becomes very loaded.
278.592	A Syrian woman who I recently met
278.592	at a refugee camp in Greece
281.883	articulated it best,
283.175	when she recalled the exact moment
283.175	she realized she had to flee Aleppo.
287.097	"""I looked out the window"
287.097	and there was nothing.
289.379	It was all rubble.
291.413	There were no stores, no streets,
291.413	no schools. Everything was gone.
295.826	I had been in my apartment for months,
297.897	listening to bombs drop
297.897	and watching people die.
301.591	But I always thought it would get better,
304.848	that no one could force me to leave,
306.946	no one could take my home away from me.
309.615	And I don't know why it was that morning,
309.615	but when I looked outside,
312.911	I realized if I didn't leave,
312.911	my three young children would die.
316.073	And so we left.
317.486	We left because we had to,
317.486	not because we wanted to.
320.514	"There was no choice,"" she said."
323.798	It's kind of hard to believe
323.798	that you belong
326.1	when you don't have a home,
327.588	when your country of origin rejects you
327.588	because of fear or persecution,
331.618	or the city that you grew up in
331.618	is completely destroyed.
336.625	I didn't feel like I had a home.
338.68	I was no longer a Jordanian citizen,
341.161	but I wasn't American, either.
343.463	I felt a kind of loneliness
345.225	that is still hard
345.225	to put into words today.
348.601	After college, I desperately needed
348.601	to find a place to call home.
352.366	I bounced around from state to state
354.106	and eventually ended up in North Carolina.
356.565	Kindhearted people who felt sorry for me
359.233	offered to pay rent
361.225	or buy me a meal or a suit
361.225	for my new interview.
364.563	It just made me feel
364.563	more isolated and incapable.
368.301	It wasn't until I met Miss Sarah,
370.139	a Southern Baptist who took me in
370.139	at my lowest and gave me a job,
373.899	that I started to believe in myself.
376.515	Miss Sarah owned a diner
376.515	in the mountains of North Carolina.
381.676	I assumed, because
381.676	of my privileged upbringing
383.869	and my Seven Sister education,
385.412	that she would ask me
385.412	to manage the restaurant.
387.64	I was wrong.
389.792	I started off washing dishes,
391.519	cleaning toilets and working the grill.
394.067	I was humbled; I was shown
394.067	the value of hard work.
397.176	But most importantly,
397.176	I felt valued and embraced.
400.744	I celebrated Christmas with her family,
402.648	and she attempted to observe
402.648	Ramadan with me.
406.056	I remember being very nervous
406.056	about coming out to her --
408.75	after all, she was a Southern Baptist.
410.816	I sat on the couch next to her
412.3	"and I said, ""Miss Sarah,"
412.3	"you know that I'm gay."""
414.855	Her response is one
414.855	that I will never forget.
417.535	"""That's fine, honey."
417.535	"Just don't be a slut."""
419.758	(Laughter)
422.954	(Applause)
425.653	I eventually moved to Atlanta,
425.653	still trying to find my home.
432.081	My journey took a strange turn
432.081	three years later,
434.484	after I met a group of refugee kids
434.484	playing soccer outside.
438.138	I'd made a wrong turn
438.138	into this apartment complex,
440.702	and I saw these kids
440.702	outside playing soccer.
443.316	They were playing barefoot
443.316	with a raggedy soccer ball
445.903	and rocks set up as goals.
447.379	I watched them for about an hour,
449.103	and after that I was smiling.
451.116	The boys reminded me of home.
453.188	They reminded me of the way
453.188	I grew up playing soccer
455.69	in the streets of Jordan,
455.69	with my brothers and cousins.
459.612	I eventually joined their game.
461.637	They were a little skeptical
461.637	about letting me join it,
464.504	because according to them,
464.504	girls don't know how to play.
467.19	But obviously I did.
468.56	I asked them if they had
468.56	ever played on a team.
470.828	They said they hadn't,
470.828	but that they would love to.
473.751	I gradually won them over,
473.751	and we formed our first team.
477.671	This group of kids would give me
477.671	a crash course in refugees, poverty
483.817	and humanity.
486.195	Three brothers from Afghanistan --
486.195	Roohullah, Noorullah and Zabiullah --
489.774	played a major role in that.
492.2	I showed up late to practice one day
492.2	to find the field completely deserted.
495.792	I was really worried.
496.997	My team loved to practice.
498.632	It wasn't like them to miss practice.
501.263	I got out of my car, and two kids
501.263	ran out from behind a dumpster,
504.375	waving their hands frantically.
506.915	"""Coach, Rooh got beat up. He got jumped."
508.986	"There was blood everywhere."""
510.588	"""What do you mean?"
510.588	"What do you mean he got beat up?"""
513.067	"""These bad kids came"
513.067	and beat him up, Coach.
515.164	"Everybody left. They were all scared."""
517.414	We hopped into my car
517.414	and drove over to Rooh's apartment.
520.156	I knocked on the door, and Noor opened it.
523.409	"""Where's Rooh? I need"
523.409	"to talk to him, see if he's OK."""
526.185	"""He's in his room, Coach."
526.185	"He's refusing to come out."""
529.145	I knocked on the door.
530.336	"""Rooh, come on out. I need to talk to you."
532.786	I need to see if you're OK
532.786	"or if we need to go to the hospital."""
535.861	He came out.
537.036	He had a big gash on his head,
537.036	a split lip,
539.839	and he was physically shaken.
542.334	I was looking at him,
543.691	and I asked the boys
543.691	to call for their mom,
546.274	because I needed to go
546.274	to the hospital with him.
548.71	They called for their mom.
550.428	She came out.
552.059	I had my back turned to her,
552.059	and she started screaming in Farsi.
556.397	The boys fell to the ground laughing.
558.496	I was very confused,
559.672	because there was nothing
559.672	funny about this.
562.21	They explained to me that she said,
564.234	"""You told me your coach"
564.234	"was a Muslim and a woman."""
567.072	From behind, I didn't appear
567.072	to be either to her.
569.465	(Laughter)
573.122	"""I am Muslim,"" I said, turning to her."
575.382	"""Ašhadu ʾan lā ʾilāha ʾilla (A)llāh,"""
577.337	reciting the Muslim declaration of faith.
580.407	Confused,
583.028	and perhaps maybe a little bit reassured,
585.042	she realized that yes,
586.221	I, this American-acting,
586.221	shorts-wearing, non-veiled woman,
589.536	was indeed a Muslim.
591.986	Their family had fled the Taliban.
595.507	Hundreds of people in their village
597.235	were murdered.
598.505	Their father was taken in by the Taliban,
600.742	only to return a few months later,
600.742	a shell of the man he once was.
606.558	The family escaped to Pakistan,
608.993	and the two older boys,
608.993	age eight and 10 at the time,
612.585	wove rugs for 10 hours a day
612.585	to provide for their family.
616.746	They were so excited when they found out
616.746	that they had been approved
620.527	to resettle in the United States,
623.043	making them the lucky 0.1 percent
623.043	who get to do that.
626.32	They had hit the jackpot.
628.75	Their story is not unique.
630.905	Every refugee family I have worked with
630.905	has had some version of this.
634.837	I work with kids
637.026	who have seen their mothers raped,
637.026	their fathers' fingers sliced off.
640.909	One kid saw a bullet
640.909	put in his grandmother's head,
643.888	because she refused to let the rebels
643.888	take him to be a child soldier.
649.763	Their journeys are haunting.
651.76	But what I get to see every day
651.76	is hope, resilience, determination,
657.558	a love of life
658.767	and appreciation for being able
658.767	to rebuild their lives.
663.427	I was at the boys' apartment one night,
665.576	when the mom came home
665.576	after cleaning 18 hotel rooms in one day.
670.41	She sat down, and Noor rubbed her feet,
673.499	saying that he was going to take care
673.499	of her once he graduated.
676.598	She smiled from exhaustion.
678.116	"""God is good. Life is good."
678.116	"We are lucky to be here."""
682.821	In the last two years, we have seen
682.821	an escalating anti-refugee sentiment.
688.039	It's global.
690.399	The numbers continue to grow
690.399	because we do nothing to prevent it
693.667	and nothing to stop it.
695.392	The issue shouldn't be stopping refugees
695.392	from coming into our countries.
698.968	The issue should be
698.968	not forcing them to leave their own.
701.98	(Applause)
718.33	Sorry.
719.679	(Applause)
729.737	How much more suffering,
732.286	how much more suffering must we take?
735.075	How many more people need to be
735.075	forced out of their homes
737.87	"before we say, ""Enough!""?"
739.275	A hundred million?
740.945	Not only do we shame,
740.945	blame and reject them
745.065	for atrocities that they had
745.065	absolutely nothing to do with,
748.832	we re-traumatize them,
750.011	when we're supposed to be welcoming
750.011	them into our countries.
755.111	We strip them of their dignity
755.111	and treat them like criminals.
758.438	I had a student in my office
758.438	a couple of weeks ago.
761.168	She's originally from Iraq.
763.008	She broke down crying.
765.415	"""Why do they hate us?"""
767.067	"""Who hates you?"""
768.265	"""Everyone; everyone hates us"
768.265	because we are refugees,
771.06	"because we are Muslim."""
773.839	In the past, I was able
773.839	to reassure my students
776.199	that the majority of the world
776.199	does not hate refugees.
778.86	But this time I couldn't.
780.688	I couldn't explain to her why someone
780.688	tried to rip off her mother's hijab
784.192	when they were grocery shopping,
786.001	or why a player on an opposing
786.001	team called her a terrorist
789.269	and told her to go back
789.269	where she came from.
791.776	I couldn't reassure her
793.562	that her father's ultimate life sacrifice
795.925	by serving in the United States
795.925	military as an interpreter
799.069	would make her more valued
799.069	as an American citizen.
802.871	We take in so few refugees worldwide.
806.769	We resettle less than 0.1 percent.
810.598	That 0.1 percent benefits us
810.598	more than them.
814.617	"It dumbfounds me how the word ""refugee"""
814.617	is considered something to be dirty,
818.427	something to be ashamed of.
820.064	They have nothing to be ashamed of.
825.647	We have seen advances
825.647	in every aspect of our lives --
828.394	except our humanity.
830.343	There are 65.3 million people
830.343	who have been forced out of their homes
834.806	because of war --
836.505	the largest number in history.
838.93	We are the ones who should be ashamed.
841.532	Thank you.
842.711	(Applause)
