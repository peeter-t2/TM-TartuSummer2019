13.863	What does it mean to spend our time well?
20.111	I spend a lot of my time
22.463	thinking about how to spend my time.
26.914	Probably too much --
26.914	I probably obsess over it.
29.225	My friends think I do.
30.694	But I feel like I kind of have to,
30.694	because these days,
35.205	it feels like little bits of my time
35.205	kind of slip away from me,
39.11	and when that happens, it feels like
39.11	parts of my life are slipping away.
45.086	Specifically,
46.261	it feels like little bits
46.261	of my time get slipped away
49.134	to various things like this,
50.762	like technology -- I check things.
53.515	I'll give you an example.
55.586	If this email shows up --
57.601	how many of you have gotten
57.601	an email like this, right?
60.31	I've been tagged in a photo.
63.684	When this appears,
65.511	I can't help but click on it right now.
68.946	Right? Because, like,
68.946	what if it's a bad photo?
71.511	So I have to click it right now.
73.582	But I'm not just going
73.582	"to click ""See photo,"""
76.053	what I'm actually going to do
76.053	is spend the next 20 minutes.
78.975	(Laughter)
80.176	But the worst part is that I know
80.176	this is what's going to happen,
84.237	and even knowing
84.237	that's what's going to happen
87.706	doesn't stop me
87.706	from doing it again the next time.
91.871	Or I find myself in a situation like this,
96.097	where I check my email
96.097	and I pull down to refresh,
101.164	But the thing is that 60 seconds later,
104.539	I'll pull down to refresh again.
110.145	Why am I doing this?
111.971	This doesn't make any sense.
115.01	But I'll give you a hint
115.01	why this is happening.
120.357	What do you think makes
120.357	more money in the United States
125.547	than movies, game parks
125.547	and baseball combined?
133.742	Slot machines.
137.195	How can slot machines make all this money
140.799	when we play with such small
140.799	amounts of money?
146.022	We play with coins.
147.704	How is this possible?
150.137	Well, the thing is ...
153.49	my phone is a slot machine.
157.809	Every time I check my phone,
159.821	I'm playing the slot machine to see,
162.162	what am I going to get?
163.925	What am I going to get?
165.109	Every time I check my email,
166.974	I'm playing the slot machine,
168.45	"saying, ""What am I going to get?"""
170.085	Every time I scroll a news feed,
173.334	I'm playing the slot machine to see,
175.3	what am I going to get next?
178.346	And the thing is that,
179.521	again, knowing exactly
179.521	how this works -- and I'm a designer,
182.637	I know exactly how
182.637	the psychology of this works,
184.938	I know exactly what's going on --
186.817	but it doesn't leave me with any choice,
189.083	I still just get sucked into it.
192.173	So what are we going to do?
194.991	Because it leaves us
194.991	with this all-or-nothing relationship
198.036	with technology, right?
200.478	You're either on,
202.51	and you're connected
202.51	and distracted all the time,
204.909	or you're off,
206.783	but then you're wondering,
208.061	am I missing something important?
210.352	In other words, you're either distracted
213.443	or you have fear of missing out.
216.363	Right?
218.822	So we need to restore choice.
223.942	We want to have
223.942	a relationship with technology
226.486	that gives us back choice
226.486	about how we spend time with it,
230.716	and we're going to need
230.716	help from designers,
234.662	because knowing this stuff doesn't help.
237.491	We're going to need design help.
239.567	So what would that look like?
242.656	So let's take an example that we all face:
245.487	chat -- text messaging.
248.089	So let's say there's two people.
249.69	Nancy's on the left
249.69	and she's working on a document,
252.87	and John's on the right.
254.669	And John suddenly remembers,
256.33	"""I need to ask Nancy"
256.33	"for that document before I forget."""
262.291	So when he sends her that message,
263.982	it blows away her attention.
267.436	That's what we're doing all the time,
267.436	bulldozing each other's attention,
270.868	left and right.
272.306	And there's serious cost to this,
274.534	because every time
274.534	we interrupt each other,
278.729	it takes us about 23 minutes, on average,
282	to refocus our attention.
283.864	We actually cycle through
283.864	two different projects
287.236	before we come back
287.236	to the original thing we were doing.
290.806	This is Gloria Mark's research
290.806	combined with Microsoft research,
295.171	that showed this.
296.553	And her research also shows
296.553	that it actually trains bad habits.
300.532	The more interruptions we get externally,
303.482	it's conditioning and training us
303.482	to interrupt ourselves.
308.303	We actually self-interrupt
308.303	every three-and-a-half minutes.
313.176	This is crazy.
314.351	So how do we fix this?
315.676	Because Nancy and John are in this
315.676	all-or-nothing relationship.
318.95	Nancy might want to disconnect,
320.475	but then she'd be worried:
321.852	What if I'm missing something important?
324.296	Design can fix this problem.
327.311	Let's say you have
327.311	Nancy again on the left,
329.368	John on the right.
330.564	And John remembers,
330.564	"""I need to send Nancy that document."""
333.279	Except this time,
334.532	Nancy can mark that she's focused.
336.493	Let's say she drags a slider and says,
338.485	"""I want to be focused for 30 minutes,"""
340.432	so -- bam -- she's focused.
342.771	Now when John wants to message her,
345.415	he can get the thought off of his mind --
347.566	because he has a need,
347.566	he has this thought,
349.663	and he needs to dump it out
349.663	before he forgets.
352.744	Except this time,
354.29	it holds the messages
354.29	so that Nancy can still focus,
358.618	but John can get the thought
358.618	off of his mind.
362.875	But this only works
362.875	if one last thing is true,
366.098	which is that Nancy needs to know
366.098	that if something is truly important,
371.564	John can still interrupt.
376.158	But instead of having constant
376.158	accidental or mindless interruptions,
380.295	we're now only creating
380.295	conscious interruptions,
384.985	So we're doing two things here.
386.53	We're creating a new choice
386.53	for both Nancy and John,
390.436	But there's a second, subtle thing
390.436	we're doing here, too.
394.022	And it's that we're changing
394.022	the question we're answering.
397.922	Instead of the goal of chat being:
402.056	"""Let's design it so it's easy"
402.056	"to send a message"" --"
405.277	that's the goal of chat,
406.731	it should be really easy to send
406.731	a message to someone --
409.808	we change the goal to something
409.808	deeper and a human value,
412.912	"which is: ""Let's create the highest"
412.912	possible quality communication
417.14	in a relationship between two people.
420.162	So we upgraded the goal.
423.832	Now, do designers
423.832	actually care about this?
426.667	Do we want to have conversations
426.667	about what these deeper human goals are?
432.538	Well, I'll tell you one story.
434.321	A little over a year ago,
437.415	I got to help organize a meeting
440.519	between some of technology's leading
440.519	designers and Thich Nhat Hanh.
446.297	Thich Nhat Hanh is an international
446.297	spokesperson for mindfulness meditation.
451.158	And it was the most amazing meeting.
452.933	You have to imagine -- picture a room --
454.977	on one side of the room,
454.977	you have a bunch of tech geeks;
458.854	on the other side of the room,
460.374	you have a bunch of long brown robes,
460.374	shaved heads, Buddhist monks.
466.442	And the questions were about
466.442	the deepest human values,
469.697	like what does the future
469.697	of technology look like
472.039	when you're designing
472.039	for the deepest questions
474.278	and the deepest human values?
476.445	And our conversation centered
476.445	on listening more deeply
480.159	to what those values might be.
482.929	He joked in our conversation
484.66	that what if, instead of a spell check,
487.551	you had a compassion check,
489.606	meaning, you might highlight a word
489.606	that might be accidentally abrasive --
493.993	perceived as abrasive by someone else.
496.844	So does this kind of conversation
496.844	happen in the real world,
500.839	not just in these design meetings?
503.917	Well, the answer is yes,
505.116	and one of my favorites is Couchsurfing.
508.413	If you didn't know,
508.413	Couchsurfing is a website
510.89	that matches people
510.89	who are looking for a place to stay
514.799	with a free couch, from someone
514.799	who's trying to offer it.
518.185	So, great service --
519.752	what would their design goal be?
521.44	What are you designing
521.44	for if you work at Couchsurfing?
524.211	Well, you would think
524.211	it's to match guests with hosts.
529.589	Right?
530.763	That's a pretty good goal.
532.042	But that would kind of be like
532.042	our goal with messaging before,
534.985	where we're just trying
534.985	to deliver a message.
537.374	So what's the deeper, human goal?
540.175	Well, they set their goal
542.144	as the need to create lasting,
542.144	positive experiences and relationships
547.822	between people who've never met before.
551.343	And the most amazing thing
551.343	about this was in 2007,
553.95	they introduced a way to measure this,
556.615	which is incredible.
558.09	I'll tell you how it works.
559.421	For every design goal you have,
560.992	you have to have
560.992	a corresponding measurement
563.084	to know how you're doing --
564.657	a way of measuring success.
566.016	So what they do is,
567.336	let's say you take two people who meet up,
572.12	and they take the number of days
572.12	those two people spent together,
577.01	and then they estimate how many
577.01	hours were in those days --
581.136	how many hours did
581.136	those two people spend together?
583.977	And then after they spend
583.977	that time together,
586.136	they ask both of them:
587.35	How positive was your experience?
589.332	Did you have a good experience
589.332	with this person that you met?
592.952	And they subtract
592.952	from those positive hours
596.346	the amount of time
596.346	people spent on the website,
600.425	because that's a cost to people's lives.
603.661	Why should we value that as success?
606.066	And what you were left with
607.546	"is something they refer to as ""net"
607.546	"orchestrated conviviality,"""
612.311	or, really, just a net
612.311	"""Good Times"" created."
615.017	The net hours that would have never
615.017	existed, had Couchsurfing not existed.
620.799	Can you imagine how inspiring it would be
620.799	to come to work every day
624.783	and measure your success
626.3	in the actual net new contribution
626.3	of hours in people's lives
631.353	that are positive,
631.353	that would have never existed
633.978	if you didn't do what you were
633.978	about to do at work today?
637.692	Can you imagine a whole world
637.692	that worked this way?
643.564	Can you imagine a social network that --
646.343	let's say you care about cooking,
647.95	and it measured its success
647.95	in terms of cooking nights organized
651.005	and the cooking articles
651.005	that you were glad you read,
653.994	and subtracted from that the articles
653.994	you weren't glad you read
656.995	or the time you spent scrolling
656.995	that you didn't like?
660.009	Imagine a professional social network
663.529	that, instead of measuring its success
663.529	in terms of connections created
667.468	or messages sent,
669.081	instead measured its success in terms
669.081	of the job offers that people got
673.417	that they were excited to get.
676.281	And subtracted the amount of time
676.281	people spent on the website.
680.643	Or imagine dating services,
683.702	like maybe Tinder or something,
685.464	where instead of measuring the number
685.464	of swipes left and right people did,
688.966	which is how they measure success today,
691.074	instead measured the deep, romantic,
691.074	fulfilling connections people created.
698.613	Whatever that was for them, by the way.
703.886	But can you imagine a whole world
703.886	that worked this way,
707.138	that was helping you spend your time well?
711.009	Now to do this you also need a new system,
713.062	because you're probably thinking,
714.764	today's Internet economy --
716.343	today's economy in general --
717.8	is measured in time spent.
719.094	The more users you have,
721.165	the more usage you have,
722.567	the more time people spend,
723.909	that's how we measure success.
726.419	But we've solved this problem before.
729.335	We solved it with organic,
731.925	when we said we need
731.925	to value things a different way.
734.883	We said this is a different kind of food.
739.067	So we can't compare it
739.067	just based on price;
741.14	this is a different category of food.
743.004	We solved it with Leed Certification,
745.761	where we said this
745.761	is a different kind of building
749.232	that stood for different values
749.232	of environmental sustainability.
754.5	What if we had something
754.5	like that for technology?
759.772	What if we had something
759.772	whose entire purpose and goal
764.993	was to help create net new positive
764.993	contributions to human life?
770.971	And what if we could
770.971	value it a different way,
774.35	so it would actually work?
776.634	Imagine you gave this different
776.634	premium shelf space on app stores.
780.589	Imagine you had web browsers
780.589	that helped route you
782.948	to these kinds of design products.
787.475	Can you imagine how exciting it would be
787.475	to live and create that world?
793.211	We can create this world today.
796.978	Company leaders, all you have to do --
799.774	only you can prioritize a new metric,
803.146	which is your metric for net positive
803.146	contribution to human life.
807.573	And have an honest
807.573	conversation about that.
809.648	Maybe you're not
809.648	doing so well to start with,
811.833	but let's start that conversation.
815.035	Designers, you can redefine success;
815.035	you can redefine design.
820.754	Arguably, you have more power
820.754	than many people in your organization
824.711	to create the choices
824.711	that all of us live by.
828.311	Maybe like in medicine,
829.736	where we have a Hippocratic oath
831.618	to recognize the responsibility
831.618	and this higher value
835.764	that we have to treat patients.
837.355	What if designers had something like that,
839.419	in terms of this new kind of design?
842.668	And users, for all of us --
844.697	we can demand technology
844.697	that works this way.
849.176	Now it may seem hard,
850.867	but McDonald's didn't have salads
850.867	until the consumer demand was there.
856.529	Walmart didn't have organic food
856.529	until the consumer demand was there.
860.746	We have to demand
860.746	this new kind of technology.
866.194	And we can do that.
868.092	And doing that
869.628	would amount to shifting
869.628	from a world that's driven and run
873.169	entirely on time spent,
877.151	to world that's driven by time well spent.
883.569	I want to live in this world,
885.68	and I want this conversation to happen.
888.586	Let's start that conversation now.
891.707	Thank you.
892.882	(Applause)
