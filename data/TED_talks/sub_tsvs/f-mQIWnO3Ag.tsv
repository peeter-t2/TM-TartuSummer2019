20.056	You might think there are
20.056	many things that I can't do
23.693	because I cannot see.
26.326	That's largely true.
27.998	Actually, I just needed
27.998	to have a bit of help
30.505	to come up to the stage.
32.363	But there is also a lot that I can do.
35.73	This is me rock climbing
35.73	for the first time.
39.166	Actually, I love sports
39.166	and I can play many sports,
43.267	like swimming, skiing, skating,
43.267	scuba diving, running and so on.
49.382	But there is one limitation:
52.145	somebody needs to help me.
54.514	I want to be independent.
57.741	I lost my sight at the age of 14
57.741	in a swimming pool accident.
62.989	I was an active, independent teenager,
65.637	and suddenly I became blind.
68.84	The hardest thing for me
68.84	was losing my independence.
73.6	Things that until then seemed simple
73.6	became almost impossible to do alone.
79.962	For example, one of my
79.962	challenges was textbooks.
84.084	Back then, there were no
84.084	personal computers,
86.858	no Internet, no smartphones.
89.319	So I had to ask one of my two brothers
89.319	to read me textbooks,
94.776	and I had to create
94.776	my own books in Braille.
98.653	Can you imagine?
100.603	Of course, my brothers
100.603	were not happy about it,
103.746	and later, I noticed they were not there
103.746	whenever I needed them.
107.593	(Laughter)
108.618	I think they tried to stay away from me.
112.434	I don't blame them.
114.581	I really wanted to be freed
114.581	from relying on someone.
119.16	That became my strong desire
119.16	to ignite innovation.
124.1	Jump ahead to the mid-1980s.
126.81	I got to know cutting-edge technologies
129.58	and I thought to myself,
131.701	how come there is no computer technology
135.344	to create books in Braille?
138.288	These amazing technologies
138.288	must be able to also help people
142.676	with limitations like myself.
145.805	That's the moment
145.805	my innovation journey began.
150.686	I started developing
150.686	digital book technologies,
154.564	such as a digital Braille editor,
154.564	digital Braille dictionary
159.881	and a digital Braille library network.
163.178	Today, every student who is visually
163.178	impaired can read textbooks,
167.57	by using personal computers
167.57	and mobile devices,
171.421	in Braille or in voice.
173.998	This may not surprise you,
176.158	since everyone now has digital books
176.158	in their tablets in 2015.
181.242	But Braille went digital
181.242	many years before digital books,
187.113	already in the late 1980s,
187.113	almost 30 years ago.
193.242	Strong and specific needs
193.242	of the blind people
197.065	made this opportunity to create
197.065	digital books way back then.
203.343	And this is actually not
203.343	the first time this happened,
208.373	because history shows us
208.373	accessibility ignites innovation.
215.467	The telephone was invented
215.467	while developing a communication tool
219.508	for hearing impaired people.
221.737	Some keyboards were also invented
221.737	to help people with disabilities.
228.807	Now I'm going to give you
228.807	another example from my own life.
232.688	In the '90s, people around me
232.688	started talking about the Internet
236.975	and web browsing.
238.895	I remember the first time
238.895	I went on the web.
242.148	I was astonished.
244.352	I could access newspapers
244.352	at any time and every day.
248.81	I could even search
248.81	for any information by myself.
253.175	I desperately wanted to help the blind
253.175	people have access to the Internet,
259.013	and I found ways to render the web
259.013	into synthesized voice,
264.343	which dramatically simplified
264.343	the user interface.
268.685	This led me to develop
268.685	the Home Page Reader in 1997,
274.119	first in Japanese and later,
274.119	translated into 11 languages.
279.784	When I developed the Home Page Reader,
282.385	I got many comments from users.
285.909	One that I strongly remember said,
289.032	"""For me, the Internet"
289.032	"is a small window to the world."""
295.185	It was a revolutionary moment
295.185	for the blind.
299.13	The cyber world became accessible,
301.331	and this technology that we created
301.331	for the blind has many uses,
306.025	way beyond what I imagined.
308.539	It can help drivers listen to their emails
312.709	or it can help you listen
312.709	to a recipe while cooking.
318.116	Today, I am more independent,
320.65	but it is still not enough.
323.668	For example, when I approached
323.668	the stage just now, I needed assistance.
330.412	My goal is to come up here independently.
334.147	And not just here.
335.991	My goal is to be able to travel
335.991	and do things that are simple to you.
342.638	OK, now let me show you
342.638	the latest technologies.
345.471	This is a smartphone app
345.471	that we are working on.
350.625	(Video) Electronic voice: 51 feet
350.625	to the door, and keep straight.
357.702	EV: Take the two doors to go out.
357.702	The door is on your right.
367.731	EV: Nick is approaching. Looks so happy.
369.693	Chieko Asakawa: Hi, Nick!
370.922	(Laughter)
371.947	CA: Where are you going?
371.947	You look so happy.
374.114	Nick: Oh -- well, my paper
374.114	just got accepted.
376.251	CA: That's great! Congratulations.
377.922	Nick: Thanks. Wait -- how'd you know
377.922	it was me, and that I look happy?
381.597	(Chieko and Nick laugh)
382.971	Man: Hi.
384.154	(Laughter)
385.895	CA: Oh ... hi.
387.07	EV: He is not talking to you,
387.07	but on his phone.
396.434	EV: Potato chips.
405.159	EV: Dark chocolate with almonds.
408.155	EV: You gained 5 pounds since yesterday;
408.155	take apple instead of chocolate.
411.7	(Laughter)
414.456	EV: Approaching.
420.038	EV: You arrived.
422.939	CA: Now ...
424.202	(Applause)
428.154	Thank you.
429.369	So now the app navigates me
432.291	by analyzing beacon signals
432.291	and smartphone sensors
436.331	and permits me to move around
436.331	indoor and outdoor environments
441.491	all by myself.
443.103	But the computer vision part
443.103	that showed who is approaching,
447.975	in which mood -- we are still
447.975	working on that part.
452.251	And recognizing facial expressions
452.251	is very important for me to be social.
459.398	So now the fusions of technologies
459.398	are ready to help me
465.588	see the real world.
467.92	We call this cognitive assistance.
471.821	It understands our surrounding world
475.164	and whispers to me in voice
475.164	or sends a vibration to my fingers.
482.088	Cognitive assistance will augment
482.088	missing or weakened abilities --
488.176	in other words, our five senses.
491.464	This technology is only in an early stage,
494.799	but eventually, I'll be able to find
494.799	a classroom on campus,
499.6	enjoy window shopping
501.378	or find a nice restaurant
501.378	while walking along a street.
506.088	It will be amazing if I can find you
506.088	on the street before you notice me.
511.595	It will become my best buddy, and yours.
516.308	So, this really is a great challenge.
520.395	It is a challenge
520.395	that needs collaboration,
524.388	which is why we are creating
524.388	an open community
527.314	to accelerate research activities.
531.192	Just this morning, we announced
531.192	the open-source fundamental technologies
536.114	you just saw in the video.
538.487	The frontier is the real world.
541.878	The blind community is exploring
541.878	this technical frontier
546.315	and the pathfinder.
548.559	I hope to work with you
548.559	to explore the new era,
552.321	and the next time that I'm on this stage,
555.432	through technology and innovation,
557.87	I will be able to walk up here
559.919	all by myself.
561.539	Thank you so much.
562.802	(Applause)
