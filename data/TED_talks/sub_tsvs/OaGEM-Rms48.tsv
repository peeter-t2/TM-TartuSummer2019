12.52	Periods.
14.12	Blood.
15.52	Menstruation.
17.44	Gross.
19.04	Secret.
20.68	Hidden.
22.4	Why?
24.76	A natural biological process
26.68	that every girl and woman
26.68	goes through every month
30.52	for about half of her life.
32.72	A phenomenon that is so significant
35.44	that the survival and propagation
35.44	of our species depends on it.
40.48	Yet we consider it a taboo.
43.16	We feel awkward
43.16	and shameful talking about it.
47.84	When I got my first periods,
49.68	I was told to keep it
49.68	a secret from others --
52.76	even from my father and brother.
55.64	Later when this chapter
55.64	appeared in our textbooks,
58.28	our biology teacher skipped the subject.
60.64	(Laughter)
64	You know what I learned from it?
66.36	I learned that it is really
66.36	shameful to talk about it.
70.08	I learned to be ashamed of my body.
72.76	I learned to stay unaware of periods
75.84	in order to stay decent.
78.44	Research in various parts of India
80.28	shows that three out of every 10 girls
80.28	are not aware of menstruation
85.04	at the time of their first periods.
87.4	And in some parts of Rajasthan
89.04	this number is as high as nine
89.04	out of 10 girls being unaware of it.
94.8	You'd be surprised to know
96.48	that most of the girls
96.48	that I have spoken to,
98.72	who did not know about periods
98.72	at the time of their first menstruation
102.56	thought that they have got blood cancer
104.96	and they're going to die soon.
108.76	Menstrual hygiene
108.76	is a very important risk factor
111.72	for reproductive tract infections.
115.04	But in India, only 12 percent
115.04	of girls and women
118.24	have access to hygienic ways
118.24	of managing their periods.
122.84	If you do the math,
	unhygienic ways to manage their periods.
129.48	I was one of them.
131.88	I grew up in a small town
131.88	called Garhwa, in Jharkhand,
134.84	where even buying a sanitary napkin
134.84	is considered shameful.
138.84	So when I started getting my periods,
140.919	I began with using rags.
144.56	After every use
144.56	I would wash and reuse them.
147.24	But to store them,
148.52	I would hide and keep it
148.52	in a dark, damp place
151.16	so that nobody finds out
151.16	that I'm menstruating.
154.52	Due to repeated washing
154.52	the rags would become coarse,
157.16	and I would often get rashes
157.16	and infections using them.
160.88	I wore these already for five years
160.88	until I moved out of that town.
167.64	Another issue
167.64	that periods brought in my life
170	those of the social restrictions
172.32	that are imposed upon our girls
172.32	and women when they're on their periods.
176.68	I think you all must be aware of it,
179	but I'll still list it
179	for the few who don't.
182.72	I was not allowed to touch or eat pickles.
185.84	I was not allowed to sit on the sofa
185.84	or some other family member's bed.
190.72	I had to wash my bed sheet
190.72	after every period,
193.2	even if it was not stained.
195.16	I was considered impure
197	and forbidden from worshipping or touching
197	any object of religious importance.
202.88	You'll find signposts outside temples
205.12	denying the entry
205.12	of menstruating girls and women.
209.08	Ironically,
210.48	most of the time it is the older woman
213.32	who imposes such restrictions
213.32	on younger girls in a family.
218.36	After all, they have grown up
218.36	accepting such restrictions as norms.
222.56	And in the absence of any intervention,
225.6	it is the myth and misconception
227.64	that propagate
227.64	from generation to generation.
231.24	During my years of work in this field,
233.12	I have even come across stories
234.64	where girls have to eat
234.64	and wash their dishes separately.
238.28	They're not allowed
238.28	to take baths during periods,
240.64	and in some households they are even
240.64	secluded from other family members.
245.72	About 85 percent of girls
245.72	and women in India
249.28	would follow one or more restrictive
249.28	customs on their periods every month.
255.32	Can you imagine what this does
256.88	to the self-esteem
256.88	and self-confidence of a young girl?
260.72	The psychological trauma
260.72	that this inflicts,
263.48	affecting her personality,
266.08	her academic performance
267.84	and every single aspect of growing up
267.84	during her early formative years?
273.76	I religiously followed all these
273.76	restrictive customs for 13 years,
278.4	until a discussion with my partner, Tuhin,
280.8	changed my perception
280.8	about menstruation forever.
284.28	In 2009, Tuhin and I were pursuing
284.28	our postgraduation in design.
289.76	We fell in love with each other
291.44	and I was at ease
291.44	discussing periods with him.
294.64	Tuhin knew little about periods.
297.52	(Laughter)
303.8	He was astonished to know
303.8	that girls get painful cramps
307.44	and we bleed every month.
308.88	(Laughter)
311	Yeah.
312.52	He was completely shocked to know
314.32	about the restrictions that are imposed
314.32	upon menstruating girls and women
319.52	by their own families and their society.
322.12	In order to help me with my cramps,
324.2	he would go on the Internet
324.2	and learn more about menstruation.
328.6	When he shared his findings with me,
330.36	I realized how little I knew
330.36	about menstruation myself.
333.96	And many of my beliefs
333.96	actually turned out to be myths.
338.36	That's when we wondered:
339.92	if we, being so well educated,
342.28	were so ill-informed about menstruation,
344.4	there would be millions of girls out there
344.4	who would be ill-informed, too.
349.76	To study --
351	to understand the problem better,
352.8	I undertook a year-long research to study
352.8	the lack of awareness about menstruation
357.44	and the root cause behind it.
359.96	While it is generally believed
361.72	that menstrual unawareness
361.72	and misconception is a rural phenomenon,
367.72	during my research,
368.96	I found that it is as much
368.96	an urban phenomenon as well.
371.96	And it exists with the educated
371.96	urban class, also.
377.28	While talking to many
377.28	parents and teachers,
379.8	I found that many of them actually
379.8	wanted to educate girls about periods
385.12	before they have started
385.12	getting their menstrual cycle.
388.84	And --
390.08	but they lacked
390.08	the proper means themselves.
393.64	And since it is a taboo,
394.92	they feel inhibition
394.92	and shameful in talking about it.
398.84	Girls nowadays get their periods
398.84	in classes six and seven,
403.48	but our educational curriculum
405.12	teaches girls about periods
405.12	only in standard eight and nine.
409.8	And since it is a taboo,
412	teachers still
412	skip the subject altogether.
416.84	So school does not
416.84	teach girls about periods,
421.12	parents don't talk about it.
423.28	Where do the girls go?
425.68	Two decades ago and now --
429.12	nothing has changed.
432.12	I shared these finding with Tuhin
432.12	and we wondered:
434.96	What if we could create something
436.6	that would help girls understand
436.6	about menstruation on their own --
441.2	something that would help
441.2	parents and teachers
445.44	talk about periods
445.44	comfortably to young girls?
449.84	During my research,
451.48	I was collecting a lot of stories.
453.48	These were stories of experiences
453.48	of girls during their periods.
458.8	These stories would make girls
458.8	curious and interested
462.08	in talking about menstruation
462.08	in their close circle.
466.04	That's what we wanted.
467.52	We wanted something
467.52	that would make the girls curious
470.88	and drive them to learn about it.
473.08	We wanted to use these stories
473.08	to teach girls about periods.
477.36	So we decided to create a comic book,
480.48	where the cartoon characters
480.48	would enact these stories
483.76	and educate girls about menstruation
483.76	in a fun and engaging way.
488.36	To represent girls
488.36	in their different phases of puberty,
491.4	we have three characters.
493.56	Pinki, who has not gotten her period yet,
496.76	Jiya who gets her period
496.76	during the narrative of the book
500.28	and Mira who has already
500.28	been getting her period.
503.56	There is a fourth character, Priya Didi.
506	Through her, girls come to know
506	about the various aspects of growing up
509.56	and menstrual hygiene management.
512.455	While making the book, we took great care
514.423	that none of the illustrations
514.423	were objectionable in any way
518.4	and that it is culturally sensitive.
521.2	During our prototype testing,
521.2	we found that the girls loved the book.
525.08	They were keen on reading it
526.48	and knowing more and more
526.48	about periods on their own.
530.039	Parents and teachers were
530.039	comfortable in talking about periods
533.08	to young girls using the book,
534.799	and sometimes even boys
534.799	were interested in reading it.
537.8	(Laughter)
539.96	(Applause)
543.84	The comic book helped
543.84	in creating an environment
547.68	where menstruation ceased to be a taboo.
550.72	Many of the volunteers took this prototype
550.72	themselves to educate girls
554.8	and take menstrual awareness workshops
554.8	in five different states in India.
558.76	And one of the volunteers
558.76	took this prototype to educate young monks
562.16	and took it to this monastery in Ladakh.
564.4	We made the final version of the book,
564.4	"called ""Menstrupedia Comic"""
567.76	and launched in September last year.
571.12	And so far,
572.52	more than 4,000 girls have been
572.52	educated by using the book in India and --
576.88	(Applause)
579.56	Thank you.
580.8	(Applause)
586.24	And 10 different countries.
589.16	We are constantly translating the book
589.16	into different languages
592.2	and collaborating with local organizations
594.96	to make this book available
594.96	in different countries.
600.6	have made this book
600.6	a part of their school curriculum
604.04	to teach girls about menstruation.
605.84	(Applause)
612.44	I am amazed to see how volunteers,
617.8	individuals, parents,
617.8	teachers, school principals,
621.96	have come together
623.48	and taken this menstrual awareness
623.48	drive to their own communities,
627.76	have made sure that the girls
627.76	learn about periods at the right age
631.48	and helped in breaking this taboo.
635.04	I dream of a future
635.04	where menstruation is not a curse,
639.36	not a disease,
640.92	but a welcoming change in a girl's life.
644.12	And I would --
645.36	(Applause)
649.96	And I would like to end this
651.36	with a small request
651.36	to all the parents here.
655.28	Dear parents,
657.24	if you would be ashamed of periods,
659.48	your daughters would be, too.
661.72	So please be period positive.
664.2	(Laughter)
665.44	Thank you.
666.68	(Applause)
