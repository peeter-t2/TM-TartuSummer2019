12.641	These are some photos of me
12.641	volunteering in a Cambodian orphanage
16.757	in 2006.
18.66	When these photos were taken,
20.587	I thought I was doing a really good thing
22.913	and that I was really helping those kids.
26.333	I had a lot to learn.
29.039	It all started for me
29.039	when I was 19 years old
31.859	and went backpacking
31.859	through Southeast Asia.
34.863	When I reached Cambodia,
36.562	I felt uncomfortable being on holiday
36.562	surrounded by so much poverty
40.86	and wanted to do something to give back.
43.695	So I visited some orphanages
43.695	and donated some clothes and books
47.437	and some money
48.755	to help the kids that I met.
51.535	But one of the orphanages I visited
51.535	was desperately poor.
55.711	I had never encountered poverty
55.711	like that before in my life.
59.985	They didn't have funds for enough food,
62.419	clean water
63.753	or medical treatment,
65.769	and the sad little faces on those kids
68.691	were heartbreaking.
70.55	So I was compelled
70.55	to do something more to help.
74.078	I fund-raised in Australia and returned
74.078	to Cambodia the following year
77.766	to volunteer at the orphanage
77.766	for a few months.
81.195	I taught English and bought
81.195	water filters and food
84.368	and took all of the kids to the dentist
84.368	for the first time in their lives.
89.307	But over the course of the next year,
91.244	I came to discover that this orphanage
91.244	that I had been supporting
94.852	was terribly corrupt.
96.934	The director had been embezzling
96.934	every cent donated to the orphanage,
101.715	and in my absence, the children
101.715	were suffering such gross neglect
106.089	that they were forced to catch mice
106.089	to feed themselves.
110.306	I also found out later
111.733	that the director had been physically
111.733	and sexually abusing the kids.
116.703	I couldn't bring myself
116.703	to turn my back on children
119.343	who I had come to know and care about
122.029	and return to my life in Australia.
124.981	So I worked with a local team
124.981	and the local authorities
128.542	to set up a new orphanage
128.542	and rescue the kids
131.945	to give them a safe new home.
136.041	But this is where my story takes
136.041	another unexpected turn.
140.77	As I adjusted to my new life
140.77	running an orphanage in Cambodia,
146.815	(Khmer) I learned
146.815	to speak Khmer fluently,
150.797	which means that I learned
150.797	to speak the Khmer language fluently.
154.344	And when I could communicate
154.344	properly with the kids,
157.419	I began to uncover some strange things.
161.517	Most of the children we had removed
161.517	from the orphanage
165.206	were not, in fact, orphans at all.
169.833	They had parents,
172.367	and the few that were orphaned
172.367	had other living relatives,
175.762	like grandparents and aunties and uncles
178.306	and other siblings.
180.705	So why were these children
180.705	living in an orphanage
185.161	when they weren't orphans?
189.097	Since 2005, the number
189.097	of orphanages in Cambodia
192.355	has risen by 75 percent,
195.596	and the number of children
195.596	living in Cambodian orphanages
198.715	has nearly doubled,
200.885	despite the fact
202.421	that the vast majority of children
202.421	living in these orphanages
205.568	are not orphans in the traditional sense.
209.097	They're children from poor families.
212.711	So if the vast majority of children
212.711	living in orphanages
215.665	are not orphans,
217.112	"then the term ""orphanage"""
218.998	is really just a euphemistic name
218.998	for a residential care institution.
224.381	These institutions go
224.381	by other names as well,
227.338	"like ""shelters,"" ""safe houses,"""
227.338	"""children's homes,"" ""children's villages,"""
232.847	"even ""boarding schools."""
235.25	And this problem is not just
235.25	confined to Cambodia.
240.271	This map shows some of the countries
240.271	that have seen a dramatic increase
244.086	in the numbers of residential
244.086	care institutions
246.945	and the numbers of children
246.945	being institutionalized.
251.627	In Uganda, for example,
253.058	the number of children
253.058	living in institutions
255.671	has increased by more than
255.671	1,600 percent since 1992.
262.409	And the problems posed
262.409	by putting kids into institutions
266.853	don't just pertain to the corrupt
266.853	and abusive institutions
271.552	like the one that I rescued the kids from.
274.231	The problems are with all forms
274.231	of residential care.
279.749	Over 60 years of international
279.749	research has shown us
283.779	that children who grow up in institutions,
287.119	even the very best institutions,
290.087	are at serious risk
290.087	of developing mental illnesses,
293.615	attachment disorders,
295.422	growth and speech delays,
297.677	and many will struggle
297.677	with an inability to reintegrate
300.665	back into society later in life
302.901	and form healthy relationships as adults.
306.646	These kids grow up
306.646	without any model of family
309.858	or of what good parenting looks like,
312.329	so they then can struggle
312.329	to parent their own children.
316.604	So if you institutionalize
316.604	large numbers of children,
320.745	it will affect not only this generation,
324.306	but also the generations to come.
328.366	We've learned these lessons
328.366	before in Australia.
331.881	It's what happened
331.881	"to our ""Stolen Generations,"""
335.73	the indigenous children
335.73	who were removed from their families
339.412	with the belief
339.412	that we could do a better job
341.857	of raising their children.
345.782	Just imagine for a moment
347.329	what residential care
347.329	would be like for a child.
350.843	Firstly, you have a constant
350.843	rotation of caregivers,
354.025	with somebody new coming on
354.025	to the shift every eight hours.
357.739	And then on top of that
357.739	you have a steady stream of visitors
360.966	and volunteers coming in,
362.752	showering you in the love
362.752	and affection you're craving
367.041	and then leaving again,
369.157	evoking all of those feelings
369.157	of abandonment,
372.083	and proving again and again
375.379	that you are not worthy of being loved.
379.475	We don't have orphanages
379.475	in Australia, the USA, the UK anymore,
385.297	and for a very good reason:
388.175	one study has shown that young adults
388.175	raised in institutions
391.768	are 10 times more likely
391.768	to fall into sex work than their peers,
	to have a criminal record,
400.586	and 500 times more likely
404.712	to take their own lives.
408.623	There are an estimated
408.623	eight million children around the world
413.351	living in institutions like orphanages,
416.399	despite the fact that around
421.623	Most have families
421.623	who could be caring for them
424.628	if they had the right support.
428.066	But for me,
429.975	the most shocking thing of all to realize
433.325	is what's contributing to this boom
436.001	in the unnecessary institutionalization
436.001	of so many children:
443.184	it's us --
445.576	the tourists, the volunteers
449.334	and the donors.
451.783	It's the well-meaning support
451.783	from people like me back in 2006,
457.278	who visit these children
457.278	and volunteer and donate,
461.171	who are unwittingly fueling an industry
461.171	that exploits children
466.294	and tears families apart.
469.761	It's really no coincidence
469.761	that these institutions are largely set up
473.563	in areas where tourists
473.563	can most easily be lured in
476.499	to visit and volunteer
476.499	in exchange for donations.
481.744	Of the 600 so-called orphanages in Nepal,
485.869	over 90 percent of them are located
485.869	in the most popular tourist hotspots.
492.222	The cold, hard truth is,
494.459	the more money that floods in
494.459	in support of these institutions,
498.826	the more institutions open
501.715	and the more children
501.715	are removed from their families
504.885	to fill their beds.
507.055	It's just the laws of supply and demand.
512.434	I had to learn all of these
512.434	lessons the hard way,
515.595	after I had already set up
515.595	an orphanage in Cambodia.
520.297	I had to eat a big piece
520.297	of humble pie to admit
524.289	that I had made a mistake
526.718	and inadvertently become
526.718	a part of the problem.
530.634	I had been an orphanage tourist,
532.986	a voluntourist.
534.871	I then set up my own orphanage
534.871	and facilitated orphanage tourism
539.878	in order to generate funds
539.878	for my orphanage,
543.281	before I knew better.
546.195	What I came to learn
548.227	is that no matter how good
548.227	my orphanage was,
551.661	it was never going to give those kids
551.661	what they really needed:
557.769	their families.
561.118	I know that it can feel
561.118	incredibly depressing
564.161	to learn that helping vulnerable children
564.161	and overcoming poverty
567.94	is not as simple as we've all
567.94	been led to believe it should be.
572.741	But thankfully, there is a solution.
576.484	These problems are reversible
576.484	and preventable,
580.306	and when we know better,
582.344	we can do better.
584.913	The organization that I run today,
587.285	the Cambodian Children's Trust,
589.581	is no longer an orphanage.
592.255	In 2012, we changed the model
592.255	in favor of family-based care.
598.891	I now lead an amazing team
598.891	of Cambodian social workers,
602.706	nurses and teachers.
604.803	Together, we work within communities
607.232	to untangle a complex web of social issues
610.57	and help Cambodian
610.57	families escape poverty.
614.595	Our primary focus is on preventing
614.595	some of the most vulnerable families
618.777	in our community
619.962	from being separated in the first place.
623.314	But in cases where it's not possible
625.371	for a child to live
625.371	with its biological family,
628.649	we support them in foster care.
631.99	Family-based care is always better
635.681	than placing a child in an institution.
640.293	Do you remember that first photo
640.293	that I showed you before?
643.875	See that girl who is just about
643.875	to catch the ball?
647.042	Her name is Torn
649.283	She's a strong, brave
649.283	and fiercely intelligent girl.
653.157	But in 2006, when I first met her
656.076	living in that corrupt
656.076	and abusive orphanage,
659.869	she had never been to school.
662.193	She was suffering terrible neglect,
664.957	and she yearned desperately
667.817	for the warmth and love of her mother.
672.354	But this is a photo of Torn today
672.354	with her family.
676.462	Her mother now has a secure job,
678.9	her siblings are doing well in high school
681.448	and she is just about to finish
681.448	her nursing degree at university.
685.928	For Torn's family --
687.523	(Applause)
696.057	for Torn's family,
697.486	the cycle of poverty has been broken.
701.091	The family-based care model
701.091	that we have developed at CCT
704.787	has been so successful,
706.62	that it's now being put forward
706.62	by UNICEF Cambodia
710.022	and the Cambodian government
711.562	as a national solution
711.562	to keep children in families.
716.936	And one of the best --
718.721	(Applause)
724.484	And one of the best ways
724.484	that you can help to solve this problem
728.85	is by giving these eight million
728.85	children a voice
732.67	and become an advocate
732.67	for family-based care.
736.358	If we work together to raise awareness,
739.484	we can make sure the world knows
742.344	that we need to put an end
742.344	to the unnecessary institutionalization
747.476	of vulnerable children.
749.973	How do we achieve that?
752.014	By redirecting our support
752.014	and our donations
755.865	away from orphanages
755.865	and residential care institutions
760.215	towards organizations that are committed
760.215	to keeping children in families.
767.384	I believe we can make this happen
767.384	in our lifetime,
770.827	and as a result, we will see
770.827	developing communities thrive
774.494	and ensure that vulnerable
774.494	children everywhere
777.711	have what all children need and deserve:
782.468	a family.
783.879	Thank you.
785.083	(Applause)
