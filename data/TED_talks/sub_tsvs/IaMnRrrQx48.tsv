12.824	I've been a critical care EMT for the past
12.824	seven years in Suffolk County, New York.
16.517	I've been a first responder in a number of incidents
18.359	ranging from car accidents to Hurricane Sandy.
21.677	If you are like most people, death might be
23.421	one of your greatest fears.
25.389	Some of us will see it coming.
26.81	Some of us won't.
28.809	There is a little-known documented medical term
30.913	called impending doom.
32.859	It's almost a symptom.
34.186	As a medical provider, I'm trained to respond
35.919	to this symptom like any other,
37.741	so when a patient having a heart attack looks at me
39.282	"and says, ""I'm going to die today,"""
41.51	we are trained to reevaluate the patient's condition.
45.236	Throughout my career, I have responded
47.382	to a number of incidents where the patient
49.328	had minutes left to live
50.965	and there was nothing I could do for them.
54.09	With this, I was faced with a dilemma:
56.876	Do I tell the dying that they are about to face death,
60.588	or do I lie to them to comfort them?
63.615	Early in my career, I faced this dilemma
65.808	by simply lying.
67.366	I was afraid.
69.295	I was afraid if I told them the truth,
71.635	that they would die in terror, in fear,
74.976	just grasping for those last moments of life.
78.182	That all changed with one incident.
80.95	Five years ago, I responded to a motorcycle accident.
83.799	The rider had suffered critical, critical injuries.
86.601	As I assessed him, I realized that there was nothing
89.432	that could be done for him,
91.399	and like so many other cases,
91.399	he looked me in the eye
94.664	"and asked that question: ""Am I going to die?"""
99.076	In that moment, I decided to do something different.
102.582	I decided to tell him the truth.
105.462	I decided to tell him that he was going to die
108.556	and that there was nothing I could do for him.
111.82	His reaction shocked me to this day.
115.596	He simply laid back and had a look
117.501	of acceptance on his face.
119.927	He was not met with that terror or fear
121.63	that I thought he would be.
124.01	He simply laid there, and as I looked into his eyes,
127.222	I saw inner peace and acceptance.
129.95	From that moment forward, I decided
131.688	it was not my place to comfort the dying with my lies.
136.402	Having responded to many cases since then
139.147	where patients were in their last moments
141.655	and there was nothing I could do for them,
143.511	in almost every case,
145.15	they have all had the same reaction to the truth,
148.484	of inner peace and acceptance.
150.55	In fact, there are three patterns
152.972	I have observed in all these cases.
157.247	The first pattern always kind of shocked me.
160.903	Regardless of religious belief or cultural background,
164.84	there's a need for forgiveness.
167.675	Whether they call it sin
169.221	or they simply say they have a regret,
172.09	their guilt is universal.
174.503	I had once cared for an elderly gentleman
175.899	who was having a massive heart attack.
178.317	As I prepared myself and my equipment
180.443	for his imminent cardiac arrest,
183.368	I began to tell the patient of his imminent demise.
187.721	He already knew by my tone
187.721	of voice and body language.
190.719	As I placed the defibrillator pads on his chest,
193.385	prepping for what was going to happen,
195.289	he looked me in the eye and said,
197.817	"""I wish I had spent more time with"
197.817	my children and grandchildren
200.517	"instead of being selfish with my time."""
203.588	Faced with imminent death,
205.92	all he wanted was forgiveness.
208.854	The second pattern I observe
210.742	is the need for remembrance.
213.03	Whether it was to be remembered in my thoughts
215.287	or their loved ones', they needed to feel
217.001	that they would be living on.
219.15	There's a need for immortality
221.474	within the hearts and thoughts of their loved ones,
224.118	myself, my crew, or anyone around.
227.391	Countless times, I have had a 
227.391	patient look me in the eyes
230.282	"and say, ""Will you remember me?"""
234.22	The final pattern I observe
236.672	always touched me the deepest, to the soul.
239.9	The dying need to know that their life had meaning.
243.44	They need to know that they did not waste their life
246.222	on meaningless tasks.
249.17	This came to me very, very early in my career.
252.319	I had responded to a call.
254.408	There was a female in her late 50s
256.332	severely pinned within a vehicle.
258.39	She had been t-boned at a high rate of speed,
262.068	critical, critical condition.
264.5	As the fire department worked
264.5	to remove her from the car,
266.74	I climbed in to begin to render care.
269.707	As we talked, she had said to me,
272.767	"""There was so much more"
272.767	"I wanted to do with my life."""
275.98	She had felt she had not left her mark on this Earth.
279.832	As we talked further, it would turn out
281.789	that she was a mother of two adopted children
284.197	who were both on their way to medical school.
287.312	Because of her, two children
289.382	had a chance they never would have had otherwise
292.1	and would go on to save lives in the medical field
294.321	as medical doctors.
296.683	It would end up taking 45 minutes
298.472	to free her from the vehicle.
300.339	However, she perished prior to freeing her.
304.569	I believed what you saw in the movies:
306.661	when you're in those last moments
307.945	that it's strictly terror, fear.
310.857	I have come to realize,
310.857	regardless of the circumstance,
313.535	it's generally met with peace and acceptance,
316.448	that it's the littlest things, the littlest moments,
320.14	the littlest things you brought into the world
323.704	that give you peace in those final moments.
326.633	Thank you.
328.665	(Applause)
