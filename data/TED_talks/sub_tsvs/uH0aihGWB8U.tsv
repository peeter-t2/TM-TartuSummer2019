19.804	I was born with bilateral retinoblastoma,
24.42	retinal cancer.
27.313	My right eye was removed
30.419	at seven months of age.
33.336	I was 13 months
33.336	when they removed my left eye.
38.003	The first thing I did
38.003	upon awakening from that last surgery
43.148	was to climb out of my crib
46.78	and begin wandering around
46.78	the intensive care nursery,
51.829	probably looking for the one
51.829	who did this to me.
55.208	(Laughter)
58.966	Evidently, wandering around the nursery
62.127	was not a problem for me without eyes.
65.702	The problem was getting caught.
69.557	It's impressions about blindness
72.731	that are far more threatening
76.221	to blind people than the blindness itself.
81.283	Think for a moment about
81.283	your own impressions of blindness.
85.23	Think about your reactions
85.23	when I first came onto the stage,
89.296	or the prospect of your own blindness,
93.347	or a loved one going blind.
97.264	The terror is incomprehensible
97.264	to most of us,
102.704	because blindness
105.159	is thought to epitomize ignorance
105.159	and unawareness,
110.829	hapless exposure to the ravages
110.829	of the dark unknown.
118.63	How poetic.
121.44	Fortunately for me,
121.44	my parents were not poetic.
124.801	They were pragmatic.
126.676	They understood that ignorance and fear
126.676	were but matters of the mind,
133.293	and the mind is adaptable.
137.282	They believed that I should grow up
140.983	to enjoy the same freedoms
140.983	and responsibilities as everyone else.
145.814	In their own words, I would move out --
148.275	which I did when I was 18 --
151.062	I will pay taxes --
153.035	thanks --
153.035	(Laughter) --
157.605	and they knew the difference
157.605	between love and fear.
162.786	Fear immobilizes us
162.786	in the face of challenge.
167.71	They knew that blindness
167.71	would pose a significant challenge.
170.612	I was not raised with fear.
173.666	They put my freedom first before all else,
177.415	because that is what love does.
180.535	Now, moving forward,
180.535	how do I manage today?
186.044	The world is a much larger nursery.
189.419	Fortunately, I have my trusty long cane,
193.32	longer than the canes
193.32	used by most blind people.
196.014	I call it my freedom staff.
199.357	It will keep me, for example,
200.913	from making an undignified 
200.913	departure from the stage. (Laughter)
207.279	I do see that cliff edge.
210.282	They warned us earlier
210.282	that every imaginable mishap
213.509	has occurred to speakers
213.509	up here on the stage.
217.1	I don't care to set a new precedent.
220.491	But beyond that,
222.425	many of you may have heard me clicking
222.425	as I came onto the stage --
225.552	(Clicking) --
226.619	with my tongue.
228.488	Those are flashes of sound
231.666	that go out and reflect
231.666	from surfaces all around me,
236.746	just like a bat's sonar,
238.118	and return to me with patterns, 
238.118	with pieces of information,
243.738	much as light does for you.
247.135	And my brain, thanks to my parents,
250.793	has been activated to form images
250.793	in my visual cortex,
256.098	which we now call the imaging system,
259.338	from those patterns of information,
259.338	much as your brain does.
263.288	I call this process flash sonar.
266.604	It is how I have learned to see
266.604	through my blindness,
272.322	to navigate my journey
275.498	through the dark unknowns
275.498	of my own challenges,
279.538	which has earned me the moniker
283.439	"""the remarkable Batman."""
287.154	Now, Batman I will accept.
289.708	Bats are cool. Batman is cool.
293.098	But I was not raised to think of myself
293.098	as in any way remarkable.
299.856	I have always regarded myself
299.856	much like anyone else
303.884	who navigates the dark unknowns
303.884	of their own challenges.
309.3	Is that so remarkable?
312.718	I do not use my eyes, I use my brain.
316.834	Now, someone, somewhere,
319.317	must think that's remarkable,
319.317	or I wouldn't be up here,
323.144	but let's consider this for a moment.
327.013	Everyone out there
329.739	who faces or who has ever
329.739	faced a challenge,
334.428	raise your hands.
337.47	Whoosh. Okay.
339.49	Lots of hands going up, a moment,
339.49	let me do a head count.
342.462	(Clicking)
345.713	This will take a while.
345.713	(Clicking) (Laughter)
348.731	Okay, lots of hands in the air.
350.205	Keep them up. I have an idea.
352.609	Those of you who use your brains
352.609	to navigate these challenges,
358.302	put your hands down.
362.423	Okay, anyone with your hands still up
365.024	has challenges of your own. (Laughter)
370.262	So we all face challenges,
372.839	and we all face the dark unknown,
376.577	which is endemic to most challenges,
376.577	which is what most of us fear, okay?
380.92	But we all have brains
384.773	that allow us, that activate to allow us
389.069	to navigate the journey
389.069	through these challenges. Okay?
396.151	Case in point: I came up here
400.284	and -- (Clicking) -- they wouldn't tell me
407.254	where the lectern was.
410.152	So you can't trust those TED folks.
414.796	"""Find it yourself,"" they said."
416.653	So -- (Laughter)
421.413	And the feedback for the P.A. system
421.413	is no help at all.
424.525	So now I present to you a challenge.
427.934	So if you'd all close your eyes
427.934	for just a moment, okay?
431.85	And you're going to learn
431.85	a bit of flash sonar.
435.507	I'm going to make a sound.
437.017	I'm going to hold this panel in front 
437.017	of me, but I'm not going to move it.
440.562	Just listen to the sound for a moment.
445.236	Shhhhhhhhhh.
451.228	Okay, nothing very interesting.
453.293	Now, listen to what happens
453.293	to that same exact sound
456.032	when I move the panel.
459.146	Shhhhhhhhhhh. 
459.146	(Pitch getting higher and lower)
470.266	You do not know the power
470.266	of the dark side.
473.609	(Laughter)
475.421	I couldn't resist.
479.832	Okay, now keep your eyes closed
482.479	because, did you hear the difference?
484.327	Okay. Now, let's be sure.
487.425	For your challenge,
489.224	"you tell me, just say ""now"""
489.224	when you hear the panel start to move.
494.308	Okay? We'll relax into this.
500.16	Shhhhhhh.
503.823	Audience: Now.
503.823	Daniel Kish: Good. Excellent.
505.888	Open your eyes.
507.381	All right. So just a few centimeters,
511.915	you would notice the difference.
514.045	You've experienced sonar.
517.528	You'd all make great blind people.
517.528	(Laughter)
520.547	Let's have a look at what can happen
523.24	when this activation process
526.584	is given some time and attention.
531.111	(Video) Juan Ruiz: It's like
531.111	you guys can see with your eyes
534.292	and we can see with our ears.
537.497	Brian Bushway: It's not a matter
537.497	of enjoying it more or less,
540.561	it's about enjoying it differently.
543.487	Shawn Marsolais: It goes across.
543.487	DK: Yeah.
546.529	SM: And then it's gradually
546.529	coming back down again.
550.337	DK: Yes!
550.337	SM: That's amazing.
551.95	I can, like, see the car. Holy mother!
561.981	J. Louchart: I love being blind.
564.048	If I had the opportunity, honestly,
564.048	I wouldn't go back to being sighted.
567.716	JR: The bigger the goal,
567.716	the more obstacles you'll face,
571.176	and on the other side of that goal
573.777	is victory.
575.425	[In Italian]
580.58	(Applause)
590.355	DK: Now, do these people look terrified?
594.245	Not so much.
596.067	We have delivered activation training
598.853	to tens of thousands of blind
598.853	and sighted people from all backgrounds
602.382	in nearly 40 countries.
604.82	When blind people learn to see,
609.302	sighted people seem inspired
612.32	to want to learn to see their way
612.32	better, more clearly, with less fear,
618.627	because this exemplifies
618.627	the immense capacity within us all
624.533	to navigate any type of challenge,
624.533	through any form of darkness,
631.046	to discoveries unimagined
634.332	when we are activated.
639.695	I wish you all a most activating journey.
645.709	Thank you very much.
647.474	(Applause)
655.716	Chris Anderson: Daniel, my friend.
658.162	As I know you can see, it's
658.162	a spectacular standing ovation at TED.
663.297	Thank you for an extraordinary talk.
666.281	Just one more question about your world,
666.281	your inner world that you construct.
671.53	We think that we have things in our world
671.53	that you as a blind person don't have,
677.095	but what's your world like?
678.819	What do you have that we don't have?
681.582	DK: Three hundred and sixty-degree view,
684.717	so my sonar works about as well
684.717	behind me as it does in front of me.
688.618	It works around corners.
690.499	It works through surfaces.
694.448	Generally, it's kind of a fuzzy
694.448	three-dimensional geometry.
699.229	One of my students, who has now
699.229	become an instructor,
703.269	when he lost his vision,
703.269	after a few months
706.195	he was sitting in his three story house
708.447	and he realized that he could hear
708.447	everything going on throughout the house:
712.464	conversations, people in the kitchen,
712.464	people in the bathroom,
716.643	several floors away, several walls away.
719.337	He said it was something
719.337	like having x-ray vision.
722.889	CA: What do you picture
722.889	that you're in right now?
726.511	How do you picture this theater?
729.53	DK: Lots of loudspeakers, quite frankly.
736.453	It's interesting. 
736.453	When people make a sound,
740.709	when they laugh, when they fidget,
740.709	when they take a drink or blow their nose
745.864	or whatever, I hear everything.
748.557	I hear every little movement
748.557	that every single person makes.
751.738	None of it really escapes my attention,
754.501	and then, from a sonar perspective,
756.355	the size of the room, the curvature 
756.355	of the audience around the stage,
762.209	it's the height of the room.
765.847	Like I say, it's all that kind 
765.847	of three-dimensional surface geometry
769.127	all around me.
770.544	CA: Well, Daniel, you have done
770.544	a spectacular job
772.83	of helping us all see the world
772.83	in a different way.
775.655	Thanks so much for that, truly.
775.655	DK: Thank you.
777.825	(Applause)
