12.312	How many of you have been to Oklahoma City?
14.485	Raise your hand. Yeah?
15.775	How many of you have not been to Oklahoma City
17.924	and have no idea who I am? (Laughter)
21.933	Most of you. Let me give you
21.933	a little bit of background.
24.731	Oklahoma City started in the most
27.173	unique way imaginable.
28.941	Back on a spring day in 1889,
31.763	the federal government held what they called
33.35	a land run.
35.109	They literally lined up the settlers
36.803	along an imaginary line,
38.426	and they fired off a gun,
39.851	and the settlers roared across the countryside
41.636	and put down a stake,
43.752	and wherever they put down that stake,
45.288	that was their new home.
46.996	And at the end of the very first day,
49.366	the population of Oklahoma City
51.116	had gone from zero to 10,000,
55.022	and our planning department
56.363	is still paying for that.
60.283	The citizens got together on that first day
62.78	and elected a mayor.
65.032	And then they shot him.
66.839	(Laughter)
71.947	That's not really all that funny
74.43	-- (Laughter) --
75.934	but it allows me to see what type of audience
77.854	I'm dealing with, so I appreciate the feedback.
82.216	The 20th century was fairly kind to Oklahoma City.
84.993	Our economy was based on commodities,
87.454	so the price of cotton or the price of wheat,
90.253	and ultimately the price of oil and natural gas.
93.566	And along the way, we became a city
95.678	of innovation.
97.724	The shopping cart was invented in Oklahoma City.
101.597	(Applause)
106.737	The parking meter, invented in Oklahoma City.
112.037	You're welcome.
115.783	Having an economy, though,
117.479	that relates to commodities
117.479	can give you some ups and some downs,
120.626	and that was certainly the case
120.626	in Oklahoma City's history.
123.223	In the 1970s, when it appeared
125.58	that the price of energy would never retreat,
127.403	our economy was soaring,
129.137	and then in the early 1980s, it cratered quickly.
132.719	The price of energy dropped.
135.19	Our banks began to fail.
136.942	Before the end of the decade,
142.387	There was no bailout on the horizon.
144.938	Our banking industry, our oil and gas industry,
147.243	our commercial real estate industry,
149.279	were all at the bottom of the economic scale.
152.482	Young people were leaving Oklahoma City in droves
155.127	for Washington and Dallas and Houston
155.127	and New York and Tokyo,
158.042	anywhere where they could 
158.042	find a job that measured up
160.149	to their educational attainment,
161.82	because in Oklahoma City,
161.82	the good jobs just weren't there.
165.051	But along at the end of the '80s
166.767	came an enterprising businessman
169.595	who became mayor named Ron Norick.
171.604	Ron Norick eventually figured out
173.351	that the secret to economic development
175.288	wasn't incentivizing companies up front,
177.449	it was about creating a place
177.449	where businesses wanted to locate,
180.503	and so he pushed an initiative called MAPS
183.515	that basically was a penny-on-the-dollar sales tax
185.92	to build a bunch of stuff.
188.232	It built a new sports arena,
190.207	a new canal downtown,
192.386	it fixed up our performing arts center,
194.747	a new baseball stadium downtown,
197.414	a lot of things to improve the quality of life.
199.258	And the economy indeed seemed to start
201.671	showing some signs of life.
203.703	The next mayor came along.
206.061	He started MAPS for Kids,
207.838	rebuilt the entire inner city school system,
210.565	all 75 buildings either built anew or refurbished.
215.319	And then, in 2004,
218.54	in this rare collective lack of judgment
223.244	bordering on civil disobedience,
225.872	the citizens elected me mayor.
229.84	Now the city I inherited
232.044	was just on the verge
233.888	of coming out of its slumbering economy,
237.289	and for the very first time,
238.98	we started showing up on the lists.
242.119	Now you know the lists I'm talking about.
244.136	The media and the Internet
245.919	love to rank cities.
248.465	And in Oklahoma City,
250.54	we'd never really been on lists before.
253.221	So I thought it was kind of cool
254.927	when they came out with these
254.927	positive lists and we were on there.
257.623	We weren't anywhere close to the top,
259.321	but we were on the list, we were somebody.
262.818	Best city to get a job,
264.648	best city to start a business,
266.663	best downtown --
268.456	Oklahoma City.
270.93	And then came the list
274.235	of the most obese cities in the country.
279.781	And there we were.
282.884	Now I like to point out that we were on that list
285.028	with a lot of really cool places.
287.526	(Laughter)
288.749	Dallas and Houston and New Orleans
292.005	and Atlanta and Miami.
293.715	You know, these are cities that, typically,
295.212	you're not embarrassed to be associated with.
297.86	But nonetheless, I didn't like being on the list.
302.128	And about that time, I got on the scales.
306.473	And I weighed 220 pounds.
308.599	And then I went to this website
310.102	sponsored by the federal government,
311.952	and I typed in my height, I typed in my weight,
315.625	and I pushed Enter,
316.954	"and it came back and said ""obese."""
321.004	"I thought, ""What a stupid website."""
323.257	(Laughter)
326.132	"""I'm not obese. I would know if I was obese."""
332.377	And then I started getting honest with myself
334.868	about what had become
334.868	my lifelong struggle with obesity,
339.794	and I noticed this pattern,
341.674	that I was gaining about two or three pounds a year,
344.365	and then about every 10 years,
344.365	I'd drop 20 or 30 pounds.
347.671	And then I'd do it again.
349.233	And I had this huge closet full of clothes,
351.566	and I could only wear a third of it at any one time,
354.933	and only I knew which part of the closet I could wear.
359.045	But it all seemed fairly normal, going through it.
364.595	Well, I finally decided I needed to lose weight,
367.677	and I knew I could because
367.677	I'd done it so many times before,
370.094	so I simply stopped eating as much.
372.332	I had always exercised.
373.587	That really wasn't the part of the equation
375.462	that I needed to work on.
377.375	But I had been eating 3,000 calories a day,
380.204	and I cut it to 2,000 calories a day,
382.486	and the weight came off. I lost about a pound a week
385.377	for about 40 weeks.
389.283	Along the way, though,
390.828	I started examining my city,
394.848	its culture, its infrastructure,
398.344	trying to figure out why our specific city
401.236	seemed to have a problem with obesity.
405.635	And I came to the conclusion
407.811	that we had built an incredible quality of life
411.669	if you happen to be a car.
415.089	(Laughter)
418.324	But if you happen to be a person,
421.864	you are combatting the car seemingly at every turn.
426.433	Our city is very spread out.
428.706	We have a great intersection of highways,
432.261	I mean, literally no traffic congestion
432.261	in Oklahoma City to speak of.
435.875	And so people live far, far away.
438.086	Our city limits are enormous, 620 square miles,
441.671	but 15 miles is less than 15 minutes.
445.216	You literally can get a speeding ticket
447.151	during rush hour in Oklahoma City.
450.748	And as a result, people tend to spread out.
453.245	Land's cheap.
456.938	We had also not required developers
459.504	to build sidewalks on new developments 
459.504	for a long, long time.
461.999	We had fixed that, but it had been relatively recently,
464.412	and there were literally 100,000
466.806	or more homes into our inventory
469.482	in neighborhoods that had 
469.482	virtually no level of walkability.
477.864	And as I tried to examine
480.118	how we might deal with obesity,
482.091	and was taking all of these elements into my mind,
483.975	I decided that the first thing we need to do
487.389	was have a conversation.
489.509	You see, in Oklahoma City,
491.468	we weren't talking about obesity.
494.249	And so, on New Year's Eve of 2007,
499.26	I went to the zoo,
501.299	and I stood in front of the elephants,
503.72	"and I said, ""This city is going on a diet,"
507.583	"and we're going to lose a million pounds."""
511.202	Well, that's when all hell broke loose.
512.975	(Laughter)
515.753	The national media
517.636	gravitated toward this story immediately,
522.153	and they really could have 
522.153	gone with it one of two ways.
525.012	They could have said,
526.543	"""This city is so fat"
528.685	"that the mayor had to put them on a diet."""
532.001	But fortunately, the consensus was,
534.504	"""Look, this is a problem in a lot of places."
536.851	This is a city that's wanting
536.851	"to do something about it."""
540.71	And so they started helping us
542.68	drive traffic to the website.
544.83	Now, the web address was
546.348	thiscityisgoingonadiet.com.
551.329	"And I appeared on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"""
554.748	one weekday morning to talk about the initiative,
558.168	and on that day, 150,000 visits
561.688	were placed to our website.
563.508	People were signing up,
565.082	and so the pounds started to add up,
567.928	and the conversation that I thought
569.535	was so important to have was starting to take place.
573.299	It was taking place inside the homes,
575.848	mothers and fathers talking about it with their kids.
578.425	It was taking place in churches.
581.086	Churches were starting their own running groups
583.082	and their own support groups
584.37	for people who were dealing with obesity.
587.102	Suddenly, it was a topic worth discussing at schools
590.514	and in the workplace.
592.146	And the large companies, they typically have
594.307	wonderful wellness programs,
595.903	but the medium-sized companies
597.226	that typically fall between the cracks
597.226	on issues like this,
600.311	they started to get engaged and used our program
603.012	as a model for their own employees
604.868	to try and have contests to see
606.814	who might be able to deal with their obesity situation
610.629	in a way that could be proactively
610.629	beneficial to others.
615.596	And then came the next stage of the equation.
620.217	It was time to push what I called MAPS 3.
624.229	Now MAPS 3, like the other two programs,
626.429	had had an economic development motive behind it,
629.093	but along with the traditional
629.093	economic development tasks
631.913	like building a new convention center,
633.675	we added some health-related infrastructure
636.439	to the process.
638.331	We added a new central park, 70 acres in size,
641.076	to be right downtown in Oklahoma City.
643.466	We're building a downtown streetcar
645.245	to try and help the walkability formula
647.493	for people who choose to live in the inner city
649.545	and help us create the density there.
652.922	We're building senior health and wellness centers
656.277	throughout the community.
657.975	We put some investments on the river
659.663	that had originally been invested upon
662.199	in the original MAPS,
663.879	and now we are currently in the final stages
665.823	of developing the finest venue in the world
668.474	for the sports of canoe, kayak and rowing.
671.29	We hosted the Olympic trials last spring.
673.182	We have Olympic-caliber events
673.182	coming to Oklahoma City,
675.586	and athletes from all over the world moving in,
678.142	along with inner city programs
679.744	to get kids more engaged in these
679.744	types of recreational activities
683.694	that are a little bit nontraditional.
686.494	We also, with another initiative that was passed,
690.22	are building hundreds of miles of new sidewalks
694.063	throughout the metro area.
696.462	We're even going back into some
698.307	inner city situations
699.802	where we had built neighborhoods
701.516	and we had built schools
703.197	but we had not connected the two.
705.123	We had built libraries and
705.123	we had built neighborhoods,
707.841	but we had never really connected the two
709.446	with any sort of walkability.
711.87	Through yet another funding source,
713.969	we're redesigning all of our inner city streets
717.304	to be more pedestrian-friendly.
718.814	Our streets were really wide,
720.691	and you'd push the button
720.691	to allow you to walk across,
723.118	and you had to run in order to get there in time.
726.666	But now we've narrowed the streets,
728.574	highly landscaped them, making them
728.574	more pedestrian-friendly,
731.482	really a redesign, rethinking the way
733.949	we build our infrastructure,
735.497	designing a city around people and not cars.
740.744	We're completing our bicycle trail master plan.
742.865	We'll have over 100 miles
744.683	when we're through building it out.
747.475	And so you see this culture starting to shift
750.736	in Oklahoma City.
752.24	And lo and behold, the demographic changes
754.917	that are coming with it are very inspiring.
757.897	Highly educated twentysomethings
759.48	are moving to Oklahoma City from all over the region
761.54	and, indeed, even from further away, in California.
768.715	When we reached a million pounds,
771.051	in January of 2012,
773.352	I flew to New York with some our participants
775.795	who had lost over 100 pounds,
777.325	whose lives had been changed,
779.61	and we appeared on the Rachael Ray show,
781.781	and then that afternoon,
781.781	I did a round of media in New York
785.188	pushing the same messages
787.629	that you're accustomed to hearing
787.629	about obesity and the dangers of it.
791.725	And I went into the lobby of Men's Fitness magazine,
796.706	the same magazine that had put us on that list
801.082	five years before.
803.445	And as I'm sitting in the lobby
803.445	waiting to talk to the reporter,
806.402	I notice there's a magazine copy
808.786	of the current issue right there on the table,
811.405	and I pick it up, and I look at the headline
813.061	across the top, and it says,
814.826	"""America's Fattest Cities: Do You Live in One?"""
819.507	Well, I knew I did,
821.652	so I picked up the magazine
823.804	and I began to look,
826.815	and we weren't on it.
829.561	(Applause)
835.984	Then I looked on the list of fittest cities,
838.909	and we were on that list.
841.072	We were on the list as the 22nd
841.072	fittest city in the United States.
844.45	Our state health statistics are doing better.
847.637	Granted, we have a long way to go.
849.749	Health is still not something
850.888	that we should be proud of in Oklahoma City,
852.425	but we seem to have turned the cultural shift
856.208	of making health a greater priority.
859.289	And we love the idea of the demographics
862.132	of highly educated twentysomethings,
863.942	people with choices, choosing Oklahoma City
865.711	in large numbers.
867.16	We have the lowest unemployment
867.16	in the United States,
869.453	probably the strongest economy in the United States.
872.325	And if you're like me, at some point
873.955	in your educational career,
876.327	you were asked to read a book called
878.544	"""The Grapes of Wrath."""
881.389	Oklahomans leaving for California
884.423	in large numbers for a better future.
886.866	When we look at the demographic shifts
888.655	of people coming from the west,
889.815	it appears that what we're seeing now
891.443	is the wrath of grapes.
894.291	(Laughter)
896.104	(Applause)
899.169	The grandchildren are coming home.
903.714	You've been a great audience and very attentive.
905.502	Thank you very much for having me here.
907.953	(Applause)
