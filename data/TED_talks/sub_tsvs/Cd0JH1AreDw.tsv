12.133	I'm a teacher and a practitioner
14.014	of civics in America.
16.499	Now, I will kindly ask those of
16.499	you who have just fallen asleep
19.571	to please wake up. (Laughter)
21.683	"Why is it that the very word ""civics"""
23.974	has such a soporific, 
23.974	even a narcoleptic effect
26.865	on us?
28.171	I think it's because the very 
28.171	word signifies something
32.312	exceedingly virtuous, 
32.312	exceedingly important,
35.42	and exceedingly boring.
37.83	Well, I think it's the responsibility of people like us,
40.883	people who show up for gatherings like this
42.637	in person or online, in any way we can,
45.384	to make civics sexy again,
48.285	as sexy as it was during the American Revolution,
51.111	as sexy as it was during the Civil Rights Movement.
54.554	And I believe the way we make civics sexy again
57.76	is to make explicitly about the teaching of power.
62.11	The way we do that, I believe,
64.603	is at the level of the city.
66.997	This is what I want to talk about today,
68.796	and I want to start by defining some terms
71.108	and then I want to describe the scale
73.183	of the problem I think we face
75.046	and then suggest the ways that I believe cities
77.472	can be the seat of the solution.
79.992	So let me start with some definitions.
83.78	By civics, I simply mean the art
85.557	of being a pro-social, problem-solving contributor
88.808	in a self-governing community.
90.935	Civics is the art of citizenship,
93.364	what Bill Gates Sr. calls simply
95.479	showing up for life,
97.571	and it encompasses three things:
99.956	a foundation of values,
103.5	an understanding of the systems
103.5	that make the world go round,
107.266	and a set of skills
109.62	that allow you to pursue goals
111.104	and to have others join in that pursuit.
114.777	And that brings me to my definition of power,
117.036	which is simply this:
119.204	the capacity to make others do
121.87	what you would have them do.
124.631	It sounds menacing, doesn't it?
127.312	We don't like to talk about power.
129.653	We find it scary. We find it somehow evil.
135.347	We feel uncomfortable naming it.
137.129	In the culture and mythology of democracy,
139.542	power resides with the people.
141.285	Period. End of story.
143.078	Any further inquiry not necessary
144.653	and not really that welcome.
146.633	Power has a negative moral valence.
150.691	It sounds Machiavellian inherently.
153.473	It seems inherently evil.
156.107	But in fact power is no more inherently good or evil
159.912	than fire or physics.
163.03	It just is.
165.14	And power governs
166.346	how any form of government operates,
167.947	whether a democracy or a dictatorship.
171.427	And the problem we face today,
171.427	here in America in particular,
174.668	but all around the world,
176.198	is that far too many people 
176.198	are profoundly illiterate
179.483	in power —
181.463	what it is, who has it,
183.533	how it operates, how it flows,
185.996	what part of it is visible, 
185.996	what part of it is not,
188.516	why some people have it, 
188.516	why that's compounded.
192.128	And as a result of this illiteracy,
195.617	those few who do understand
198.483	how power operates in civic life,
200.973	those who understand
202.311	how a bill becomes a law, yes,
204.134	but also how a friendship 
204.134	becomes a subsidy,
208.289	or how a bias becomes a policy,
211.694	or how a slogan becomes a movement,
214.629	the people who understand those things
216.609	wield disproportionate influence,
218.18	and they're perfectly happy
219.66	to fill the vacuum created by the ignorance
222.74	of the great majority.
227.124	This is why it is so fundamental for us right now
230.543	to grab hold of this idea of power
234.999	and to democratize it.
236.755	One of the things that is so profoundly exciting
241.299	and challenging about this moment
243.282	is that as a result of this power illiteracy
246.484	that is so pervasive,
249.151	there is a concentration
252.24	of knowledge, of understanding, of clout.
256.491	I mean, think about it:
258.578	How does a friendship become a subsidy?
261.993	Seamlessly,
263.27	when a senior government official decides
265.905	to leave government and become a lobbyist
268.402	for a private interest
270.316	and convert his or her relationships into capital
273.018	for their new masters.
275.325	How does a bias become a policy?
277.75	Insidiously, just the way that
281.35	stop-and-frisk, for instance,
283.51	became over time a bureaucratic numbers game.
287.166	How does a slogan become a movement?
290.271	Virally, in the way that the Tea Party, for instance,
293.252	"was able to take the ""Don't Tread on Me"" flag"
296.718	from the American Revolution,
298.465	or how, on the other side,
300.315	a band of activists could take a magazine headline,
303.279	"""Occupy Wall Street,"""
305.216	and turn that into a global meme and movement.
308.132	The thing is, though, most people
310.638	aren't looking for and don't
310.638	want to see these realities.
313.89	So much of this ignorance, this civic illiteracy,
317.325	is willful.
319.122	There are some millennials, for instance,
320.97	who think the whole business is just sordid.
323.636	They don't want to have anything to do with politics.
325.312	They'd rather just opt out
326.391	and engage in volunteerism.
329.179	There are some techies out there
331.372	who believe that the cure-all
332.668	for any power imbalance or power abuse
335.216	is simply more data,
337.61	more transparency.
340.093	There are some on the left who think power resides
342.308	only with corporations,
344.167	and some on the right who think power
346.09	resides only with government,
347.603	each side blinded by their selective outrage.
351.964	There are the naive who believe that
354.008	good things just happen
355.315	and the cynical who believe
355.315	that bad things just happen,
358.665	the fortunate and unfortunate alike
361.017	who think that their lot is simply what they deserve
364.54	rather than the eminently alterable result
368.501	of a prior arrangement, an inherited allocation,
371.783	of power.
375.446	As a result of all of this
375.446	creeping fatalism in public life,
379.122	we here, particularly in America today,
381.259	have depressingly low levels
383.141	of civic knowledge, civic engagement, participation,
386.199	awareness.
389.38	The whole business of politics has been
391.258	effectively subcontracted out
391.258	to a band of professionals,
394.95	money people, outreach people,
396.761	message people, research people.
398.851	The rest of us are meant to feel like amateurs
401.922	in the sense of suckers.
404.088	We become demotivated to learn more
406.614	about how things work.
407.996	We begin to opt out.
413.59	Well, this problem, this challenge,
417.221	is a thing that we must now confront,
419.91	and I believe that when you have
420.901	this kind of disengagement, this willful ignorance,
423.88	it becomes both a cause and a consequence
427.359	of this concentration of opportunity
430.235	of wealth and clout that I was
430.235	describing a moment ago,
432.596	this profound civic inequality.
436.334	This is why it is so important in our time right now
439.475	to reimagine civics as the teaching of power.
442.922	Perhaps it's never been more important
445.566	at any time in our lifetimes.
450.955	If people don't learn power,
452.89	people don't wake up,
454.458	and if they don't wake up,
456.213	they get left out.
458.98	Now, part of the art of practicing power
463.452	means being awake and having a voice,
465.512	but it also is about having an arena
467.897	where you can plausibly practice deciding.
471.959	All of civics boils down to the simple question
474.141	of who decides,
475.899	and you have to play that out
477.661	in a place, in an arena.
479.694	And this brings me to the third
479.694	point that I want to make today,
482.622	which is simply that there is no better arena
486.233	in our time for the practicing of power
489.282	than the city.
492.174	Think about the city where you live,
494.028	where you're from.
495.885	Think about a problem in
495.885	the common life of your city.
499.136	It can be something small,
500.169	like where a street lamp should go,
502.676	or something medium like
504.297	which library should have its hours extended or cut,
508.234	or maybe something bigger,
509.804	like whether a dilapidated waterfront should be
512.502	turned into a highway or a greenway,
515.437	or whether all the businesses in your town
517.135	should be required to pay a living wage.
521.185	Think about the change that you want in your city,
523.536	and then think about how you would get it,
527.248	how you would make it happen.
530.88	Take an inventory of all the forms of power
533.21	that are at play in your city's situation:
536.354	money, of course, people, yes,
540.693	ideas, information, misinformation,
545.603	the threat of force, the force of norms.
549.227	All of these form of power are at play.
551.138	Now think about how you would activate
552.68	or perhaps neutralize these various forms of power.
557.483	This is not some Game of Thrones
560.689	empire-level set of questions.
563.025	These are questions that play out
564.918	in every single place on the planet.
567.664	I'll just tell you quickly about two stories
569.823	drawn from recent headlines.
571.859	In Boulder, Colorado,
573.301	voters not too long ago approved a process
577.29	to replace the private power company,
580.182	literally the power company,
580.182	the electric company Xcel,
582.494	with a publicly owned utility
584.79	that would forego profits
586.136	and attend far more to climate change.
589.845	Well, Xcel fought back,
591.97	and Xcel has now put in play a ballot measure
594.33	that would undermine or undo
596.226	this municipalization.
598.022	And so the citizen activists in
598.022	Boulder who have been pushing this
600.636	now literally have to fight the power
603.37	in order to fight for power.
605.969	In Tuscaloosa, at the University of Alabama,
610.342	there's an organization on campus
612.278	called, kind of menacingly, the Machine,
616.151	and it draws from largely white sororities
619.522	and fraternities on campus,
620.962	and for decades, the Machine has dominated
623.381	student government elections.
625.234	Well now, recently, the Machine
627.63	has started to get involved
628.927	in actual city politics,
630.61	and they've engineered the election
632.268	of a former Machine member,
633.64	a young, pro-business recent graduate
636.346	to the Tuscaloosa city school board.
639.86	Now, as I say, these are just two examples
642.696	drawn almost at random from the headlines.
645.4	Every day, there are thousands more like them.
648.6	And you may like or dislike
650.364	the efforts I'm describing here
652.269	in Boulder or in Tuscaloosa,
653.598	but you cannot help but admire
656.24	the power literacy of the players involved,
659.311	their skill.
660.486	You cannot help but reckon with and recognize
663.462	the command they have
665.073	of the elemental questions
667.608	of civic power —
669.484	what objective, what strategy, what tactics,
673.522	what is the terrain, who are your enemies,
676.5	who are your allies?
678.65	Now I want you to return
680.395	to thinking about that problem or that opportunity
683.79	or that challenge in your city,
685.951	and the thing it was that you want to fix
687.824	or create in your city,
689.635	and ask yourself,
691.95	do you have command of these
691.95	elemental questions of power?
695.6	Could you put into practice effectively
698.65	what it is that you know?
701.664	This is the challenge and the opportunity for us.
706.061	We live in a time right now
708.577	where in spite of globalization
711.564	or perhaps because of globalization,
713.724	all citizenship is ever more resonantly,
715.76	powerfully local.
717.54	Indeed, power in our time is flowing
720.248	ever faster to the city.
722.61	Here in the United States, the national government
724.258	has tied itself up in partisan knots.
727.259	Civic imagination and innovation and creativity
730.181	are emerging from local ecosystems now
732.798	and radiating outward,
734.688	and this great innovation,
738.128	this great wave
741.055	of localism that's now arriving,
744.981	and you see it in how people eat
746.646	and work and share and buy and move
749.294	and live their everyday lives,
750.989	this isn't some precious parochialism,
754.142	this isn't some retreat into insularity, no.
757.456	This is emergent.
759.819	The localism of our time is networked powerfully.
763.61	And so, for instance,
764.873	consider the ways that strategies
767.036	for making cities more bike-friendly
769.47	have spread so rapidly from Copenhagen
772.016	to New York to Austin to Boston to Seattle.
777.138	Think about how experiments
777.138	in participatory budgeting,
780.702	where everyday citizens get a chance
782.175	to allocate and decide upon
784.976	the allocation of city funds.
787.91	Those experiments have
787.91	spread from Porto Alegre, Brazil
791.49	to here in New York City, 
791.49	to the wards of Chicago.
795.853	Migrant workers from Rome to Los Angeles
797.991	and many cities between
800.341	are now organizing to stage strikes
802.624	to remind the people who live in their cities
804.694	what a day without immigrants would look like.
807.98	In China, all across that country,
810.438	members of the New Citizens' Movement
812.646	are beginning to activate and organize
814.232	to fight official corruption and graft,
816.886	and they're drawing the ire of officials there,
818.99	but they're also drawing the attention
820.733	of anti-corruption activists all around the world.
824.288	In Seattle, where I'm from,
826.223	we've become part of a great global array of cities
828.669	that are now working together
830.228	bypassing government altogether,
831.758	national government altogether,
834.138	in order to try to meet the carbon reduction goals
836.487	of the Kyoto Protocol.
838.627	All of these citizens, united,
841.67	are forming a web,
843.345	a great archipelago of power
845.358	that allows us to bypass
847.765	brokenness and monopolies of control.
851.669	And our task now is to accelerate this work.
854.55	Our task now is to bring more and more people
856.664	into the fold of this work.
858.695	That's why my organization, Citizen University,
861.444	has undertaken a project now
863.448	to create an everyman's curriculum
866.293	in civic power.
868.61	And this curriculum starts with this triad
870.815	that I described earlier of values,
872.83	systems and skills.
875.956	And what I'd like to do is to invite all of you
878.808	to help create this curriculum
881.458	with the stories and the experiences
883.885	and the challenges that each of you lives and faces,
887.142	to create something powerfully collective.
890.146	And I want to invite you in particular to try
892.557	a simple exercise drawn
894.656	from the early frameworks of this curriculum.
897.199	I want you to write a narrative,
899.63	a narrative from the future of your city,
902.68	and you can date it, set it out one year from now,
906.221	five years from now, a decade from now,
907.965	a generation from now,
909.766	and write it as a case study looking back,
913.611	looking back at the change
915.256	that you wanted in your city,
917.352	looking back at the cause
917.352	that you were championing,
920.091	and describing the ways that that change
922.825	and that cause came, in fact, to succeed.
927.036	Describe the values
928.948	of your fellow citizens that you activated,
931.333	and the sense of moral purpose
931.333	that you were able to stir.
934.94	Recount all the different ways
936.602	that you engaged the systems of government,
939.23	of the marketplace,
940.741	of social institutions, of faith organizations,
942.946	of the media.
946.148	Catalog all the skills you had to deploy,
950.113	how to negotiate, how to advocate,
952.527	how to frame issues,
953.922	how to navigate diversity in conflict,
956.463	all those skills that enabled you
958.282	to bring folks on board
960.353	and to overcome resistance.
963.05	What you'll be doing when you write that narrative
966.422	is you'll be discovering how to read power,
970.501	and in the process, how to write power.
975.698	So share what you write,
977.903	do you what you write,
979.241	and then share what you do.
983.058	I invite you to literally share
985.052	the narratives that you create
986.946	on our Facebook page for Citizen University.
989.89	But even beyond that, it's in the conversations
992.572	that we have today
994.128	all around the world in the simultaneous gatherings
996.389	that are happening on this topic at this moment,
999.239	and to think about how we can become
1000.99	one another's teachers and students in power.
1004.59	If we do that, then together
1006.863	we can make civics sexy again.
1009.276	Together, we can democratize democracy
1011.678	and make it safe again for amateurs.
1014.888	Together, we can create a great network of city
1019.237	that will be the most powerful collective laboratory
1021.769	for self-government this planet has ever seen.
1025.235	We have the power to do that.
1028.221	Thank you very much.
1030.69	(Applause)
