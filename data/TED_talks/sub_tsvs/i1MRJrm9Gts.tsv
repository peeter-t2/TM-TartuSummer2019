12.92	Tonight, I'm going to share with you
12.92	my passion for science.
16.56	I'm not talking about science
16.56	that takes baby steps.
19.6	I'm talking about science
19.6	that takes enormous leaps.
23.88	I'm talking Darwin, I'm talking Einstein,
27.28	I'm talking revolutionary science
27.28	that turns the world on its head.
31.44	In a moment, I'm going to talk
31.44	about two ideas that might do this.
35.8	"I say ""might"""
37.04	because, with revolutionary ideas,
37.04	most are flat wrong,
39.84	and even those that are right
39.84	seldom have the impact
42.32	that we want them to have.
44.04	To explain why I picked
44.04	two ideas in particular,
46.56	I'm going to start with a mystery.
53.08	Ignaz Semmelweis was a somber,
53.08	compulsively thorough doctor
56.72	who ran two maternity clinics.
58.6	They were identical except for one thing.
61.72	Women were dying of high fevers
61.72	soon after giving birth
64.4	three times more often
64.4	at one of the clinics than at the other.
68.6	Trying to figure out
68.6	what the difference was that caused this,
71.56	Semmelweis looked at everything he could.
73.6	Sanitation? No.
75.36	Medical procedures? No.
78	Air flow? No.
80.8	The puzzle went unsolved
80.8	until he happened to autopsy a doctor
84.08	who died of an infected scalpel cut.
86.76	The doctor's symptoms were identical
86.76	to those of the mothers who were dying.
90.56	How was that possible?
91.96	How could a male doctor
91.96	get the same thing as new mothers?
95.56	Semmelweis reconstructed
95.56	everything the doctor had done
98.84	right before he got sick,
100.12	and he discovered
100.12	that he'd been autopsying a corpse.
104.44	Had something gotten
104.44	in his wound that killed him?
108.76	With growing excitement,
110.56	Semmelweis looked
110.56	for any connection he could
113.4	between dead bodies in the morgue
113.4	and dead mothers in his delivery room,
118.8	and he found it.
121.32	It turned out that at the hospital
121.32	with the high death rate,
124.2	but not the others,
126	doctors delivered babies immediately
126	after autopsying corpses in the morgue.
131.16	Aha! Corpses were contaminating
131.16	the doctors' hands
135.12	and killing his mothers.
137.24	So he ordered the doctors
137.24	to sterilize their hands,
140.32	and the deaths stopped.
143.4	Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis
143.4	had discovered infectious disease.
148.4	But the doctors of the day
148.4	thought he was crazy,
151.84	because they knew,
151.84	and had for hundreds of years,
155.36	that odorous vapors
155.36	called miasmas caused disease,
160.48	not these hypothetical particles
160.48	that you couldn't see.
164.88	It took 20 years
164.88	for Frenchman Louis Pasteur
169.08	to prove that Semmelweis was right.
171.68	Pasteur was an agricultural chemist
174.4	who tried to figure out
174.4	why milk and beer spoiled so often.
178.6	He found that bacteria were the culprits.
182.16	He also found that bacteria
182.16	could kill people in exactly the same way
186.04	that Semmelweis's patients were dying.
189.12	We now look at what I want
189.12	to talk about tonight, in two ideas.
194.6	We saw it with Semmelweis,
194.6	that he was a revolutionary.
198.56	He did it for two reasons.
199.84	One, he opened our eyes
199.84	to a completely new world.
203.72	We'd known since the 1680s about bacteria.
206.72	We just didn't know
206.72	that bacteria killed people.
209.2	And he also demolished fond ideas
209.2	that people kept close to their heart.
214.28	Miasmas didn't kill people.
214.28	Bacteria killed people.
218.08	So this brings me to the two ideas
218.08	I want to talk about tonight.
221.44	One has opened our eyes
221.44	to a completely new universe,
224.28	and the other attacks long-held beliefs.
228.28	Let's get started with Dr. Eric Betzig.
230.24	He's a physicist who has opened our eyes
230.24	to an entirely new world
234.16	by violating the laws of physics.
236.72	Betzig is a true rebel.
238.56	He quit a job at prestigious
238.56	Bell Laboratory
241.48	inventing new microscopes for biology
243.76	because he thought scientists
243.76	were taking his brilliant inventions
248.12	and doing lousy work with them.
250.88	So he became a househusband,
255.36	but he never lost his passion
255.36	for figuring out
257.96	how to get microscopes
257.96	to see finer and finer details
260.88	than had ever been seen before
260.88	or ever could be seen.
263.96	This is crucial if we're ever
263.96	going to understand how cells work,
268.44	and how cancer works,
269.959	and how something
275.4	can do all these amazing things,
277.56	like make proteins
279.16	and move charges around
281.08	and all of those things.
283.4	There's just one problem.
286.04	There's this thing
286.04	called the law of physics,
289.04	and part of the law of physics
289.04	is the thing called the diffraction limit.
292.52	The diffraction limit is kind of like
292.52	when you go to a doctor's office,
295.92	you can only see so far down,
295.92	no matter how good glasses you have.
299.08	This was a so-called impossible problem.
302.48	But one of Betzig's friends
302.48	figured out how to take a tiny molecule
305.68	that was smaller than
305.68	the best microscope could see
308.12	and get it to light up and fluoresce.
310.28	"""Aha!"" Betzig said."
312.8	"""I think maybe the laws of physics"
312.8	"are not so unbreakable after all."""
317.52	So he lashed together a microscope
317.52	in his friend's living room.
322.4	He had no laboratory.
324.24	This revolutionary instrument
324.24	got different protein molecules
327.84	to light up in different colors,
330.08	and with a computer, he was able
330.08	to turn very, very fuzzy blurs
334.8	into very sharp dots and produce images
334.8	of unprecedented and startling clarity.
341.52	For this work, last year,
343.84	Eric Betzig won the Nobel Prize.
347.36	Why?
348.6	Because now we can see
348.6	with unprecedented detail
352.72	things that we never had seen before,
354.56	and now doctors can get
354.56	a better handle on things like cancer.
359.08	But do you think
359.08	Betzig was satisfied there?
361.6	No.
362.92	He wanted movies.
364.8	The problem was
366.04	that even the genius microscopes
366.04	that he invented were just too slow.
370.04	So what did he do?
371.32	He came up with a 200-year-old idea
374.92	called moir√© patterns.
376.64	So the way that works is
376.64	if you take two very, very fine patterns
380.12	and you move them across each other,
381.92	you will see a gross pattern
384.96	that a microscope can see
387.36	that otherwise you would not
387.36	be able to see.
389.48	So he applied this technique
389.48	to taking a really blurry image of a cell
392.8	and moving lots of structured
392.8	light patterns across it
395.4	until this cell became crystal clear.
398.84	And here is the result:
400.88	a mysterious new world,
403.64	full of strange things zipping around
405.8	doing things that
405.8	we don't know what they're doing.
409.6	But when we figure it out,
409.6	we'll have a better handle on life itself.
413.6	For example, those
413.6	green globs that you see?
415.72	Those things are called clathrins.
417.96	They're molecules
417.96	that protect other molecules
420.4	as they move through a cell.
421.8	Unfortunately, viruses sometimes
421.8	hijack those to infect cells.
426.16	Also, you see those little squiggly
426.16	wormlike things moving around?
429.28	Those are actin molecules.
431.6	Unfortunately, viruses
431.6	also climb down those things
434.04	to get into the cell nucleus
435.52	to replicate themselves and make you sick.
438.24	Now that we can look at movies
440.12	of what's actually going on
440.12	deep inside a cell,
443	we have a much better chance
443	of curing viral diseases like AIDS.
447.68	So when you look at a movie like this,
449.56	it's very clear that Betzig has opened
449.56	our eyes to a completely new world.
454.56	But he hasn't shattered
454.56	any cherished beliefs.
459.2	That leads us to Dr. Aubrey de Grey
462.16	at Cambridge.
464.44	De Grey definitely has scientists
464.44	squirming with an interesting idea:
468.8	we can be immortal.
470.2	We can beat aging.
471.84	Now, most scientists
471.84	think he's a crackpot.
475.32	Any Biology 101 student knows
478.64	that aging is an inevitable
478.64	consequence of living.
482.68	For example, when we eat,
484.8	we take in food and we metabolize it,
486.68	and that throws off
486.68	what we call free radicals.
489.08	You might have heard of those.
490.56	Also known as oxygen ions,
492.52	those bind to our DNA, cause it to mutate,
494.92	and cause us to get old and lose our hair.
497	(Laughter)
498.6	It's just like, no, it's exactly like
501.36	oxygen binding to iron and making it rust.
503.56	So you age because you rust out.
506.04	(Laughter)
508.24	Oh, and scientists also know
508.24	there is something called immortality:
513.36	in cancer cells.
515.36	So if you stop aging,
517.68	all of you are going to turn
517.68	into giant walking malignant tumors.
522.68	These are cherished beliefs,
522.68	but could de Grey be on to something?
527.159	I think he deserves a closer look.
528.84	First of all, I have a really hard time
528.84	seeing him as a crackpot.
532	Yeah, he started off life
532	as a computer scientist,
534.36	not a biologist,
535.88	but he earned a PhD
535.88	in biology from Cambridge,
539.72	and he has published
539.72	some very significant work
542.12	on mitochondrial DNA
542.12	and a bunch of other stuff.
544.6	Secondly, he started
544.6	an antiaging foundation
547.72	that has identified
547.72	seven different causes of aging,
550.32	to me, that seem very plausible,
552.6	and he is hot in pursuit
552.6	of fixes for every single one of them.
556.76	For example, one of the reasons we age
556.76	is that our mitochondrial DNA mutates,
561.8	and we get kind of old
561.8	and our cells lose energy.
565.16	He believes, and he's made
565.16	a convincing case,
567.52	that using viruses we can do gene therapy,
570.08	fix that DNA
571.76	and rejuvenate our cells.
575.4	One more thing.
576.76	We have an existent proof
578.64	that extreme longevity is possible.
582.52	Bristlecone pine trees live 5,000 years,
587.72	and some lobsters don't age at all.
592.64	Now, this doesn't mean that de Grey
592.64	is going to revolutionize our lifespans.
597	I mean, after all, we're not trees,
597	and most of us are not lobsters.
600.84	(Laughter)
602.08	But I've got to believe that there are
602.08	Darwins and Einsteins out there,
607.84	and I'll tell you why.
609.24	Consider this:
611.16	there are seven times more people
611.16	alive today than during Darwin's time.
616.48	There are four times as many people
616.48	alive today as Einstein.
619.96	When you consider
621.2	that the proportion of scientists
621.2	in the population has skyrocketed,
624.44	there are now seven million scientists.
626.84	I've got to believe, and I do believe,
626.84	that there's one of them out there
631.72	who is working right now in obscurity
634.08	to rock our lives,
634.08	and I don't know about you,
636.52	but I can't wait to be rocked.
638.36	Thank you.
639.64	(Applause)
