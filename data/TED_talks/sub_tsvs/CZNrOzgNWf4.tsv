12.29	I'm a physician trained in infectious diseases,
17.538	and following my training,
19.932	I moved to Somalia
22.854	from San Francisco.
24.898	And my goodbye greeting
26.513	from the chief of infectious diseases
28.366	at San Francisco General was,
30.462	"""Gary, this is the biggest mistake you'll ever make."""
34.145	But I landed in a refugee situation
38.193	that had a million refugees in 40 camps,
42.266	and there were six of us doctors.
44.793	There were many epidemics there.
47.109	My responsibilities were largely related to
49.722	tuberculosis,
51.463	and then we got struck by an epidemic of cholera.
55.329	So it was the spread of tuberculosis
57.392	and the spread of cholera
59.439	that I was responsible for inhibiting.
64.64	And in order to do this work, we, of course,
67.281	because of the limitation in health workers,
69.981	had to recruit refugees to be a specialized
73.747	new category of health worker.
76.506	Following three years of work in Somalia,
79.734	I got picked up by the World Health Organization,
82.344	and got assigned to the epidemics of AIDS.
85.391	My primary responsibility was Uganda,
88.264	but also I worked in Rwanda and Burundi
91.267	and Zaire, now Congo,
94.354	Tanzania, Malawi, and several other countries.
97.922	And my last assignment there was to run a unit
100.383	called intervention development,
102.268	which was responsible for designing interventions.
105.984	After 10 years of working overseas,
108.959	I was exhausted.
110.682	I really had very little left.
112.88	I had been traveling to one country after another.
117.292	I was emotionally feeling very isolated.
120.756	I wanted to come home.
122.894	I'd seen a lot of death,
124.93	in particular epidemic death,
127.88	and epidemic death has a different feel to it.
130.828	It's full of panic and fear,
134.436	and I'd heard the women wailing and crying
138.247	in the desert.
140.54	And I wanted to come home and take a break
142.933	and maybe start over.
145.972	I was not aware of any epidemic problems
148.824	in America.
150.461	In fact, I wasn't aware of any problems in America.
153.748	In fact -- seriously.
155.828	And in fact I would visit friends of mine,
158.67	and I noticed that they had water
161.759	that came right into their homes.
163.772	How many of you have such a situation?
165.647	(Laughter)
166.815	And some of them, many of them actually,
169.426	had water that came into more than one room.
171.541	And I noticed that they would move
174.788	this little thermoregulatory device
176.795	to change the temperature in their home
179.07	by one degree or two degrees.
181.921	And now I do that.
183.602	And I really didn't know what I would do,
187.855	but friends of mine began telling me
190.4	about children shooting other children with guns.
194.38	And I asked the question,
196.195	what are you doing about it?
198.153	What are you in America doing about it?
200.261	And there were two essential explanations
202.673	or ideas that were prevalent.
204.922	And one was punishment.
206.976	And this I had heard about before.
209.149	We who had worked in behavior
211.793	knew that punishment was something that was discussed
215.177	but also that it was highly overvalued.
218.014	It was not a main driver of behavior,
220.358	nor was it a main driver of behavior change.
224.248	And besides that, it reminded me
226.298	of ancient epidemics
228.8	that were previously completely misunderstood
231.87	because the science hadn't been there before,
234.444	epidemics of plague
236.83	or typhus or leprosy,
239.742	where the prevalent ideas were that there were
242.479	bad people or bad humors or bad air,
246.121	and widows were dragged around the moat,
248.73	and dungeons were part of the solution.
252.177	The other explanation or, in a way,
254.33	the solution suggested,
256.104	is please fix all of these things:
259.104	the schools, the community, the homes, the families,
262.436	everything.
263.962	And I'd heard this before as well.
265.775	"I'd called this the ""everything"" theory,"
268.51	or EOE: Everything On Earth.
271.178	But we'd also realized
272.789	in treating other processes and problems
276.426	that sometimes you don't need to treat everything.
279.341	And so the sense that I had
281.525	was there was a giant gap here.
284.123	The problem of violence was stuck,
286.869	and this has historically been the case
289.135	in many other issues.
290.297	Diarrheal diseases had been stuck.
291.875	Malaria had been stuck.
293.354	Frequently, a strategy has to be rethought.
295.824	It's not as if I had any idea what it would look like,
299.114	but there was a sense that we would have to do
302.42	something with new categories of workers
304.673	and something having to do with behavior change
306.941	and something having to do with public education.
311.05	But I began to ask questions
313.117	and search out the usual things
315.655	that I had been exploring before,
317.607	like, what do the maps look like?
319.14	What do the graphs look like?
320.59	What does the data look like?
322.629	And the maps of violence
325.025	in most U.S. cities
326.987	looked like this.
328.979	There was clustering.
330.643	This reminded me of clustering that we'd seen also
333.981	in infectious epidemics,
335.724	for example cholera.
337.716	And then we looked at the maps,
340.083	and the maps showed this typical wave
342.797	upon wave upon wave,
344.59	because all epidemics
345.945	are combinations of many epidemics.
348.519	And it also looked like infectious epidemics.
351.623	And then we asked the question,
353.236	well what really predicts a case of violence?
356.778	And it turns out that the greatest predictor
359.023	of a case of violence is a preceding case of violence.
362.331	Which also sounds like, if there is a case of flu,
365.561	someone gave someone a case of flu, or a cold,
368.461	or the greatest risk factor of tuberculosis
370.901	is having been exposed to tuberculosis.
373.953	And so we see that violence is, in a way,
376.685	behaving like a contagious disease.
379.844	We're aware of this anyway
381.394	even in our common experiences
383.33	or our newspaper stories
385.14	of the spread of violence from fights
388.264	or in gang wars or in civil wars
391.715	or even in genocides.
393.973	And so there's good news about this, though,
396.545	because there's a way to reverse epidemics,
399.35	and there's really only three things that are done
401.356	to reverse epidemics,
403.224	and the first of it is interrupting transmission.
405.864	In order to interrupt transmission,
407.79	you need to detect and find first cases.
411.34	In other words, for T.B. you have to find somebody
414.354	who has active T.B. who is infecting other people.
417.602	Make sense?
419.019	And there's special workers for doing that.
421.283	For this particular problem,
423.142	we designed a new category of worker
425.457	who, like a SARS worker
426.802	or someone looking for bird flu,
428.663	might find first cases.
430.41	In this case, it's someone who's very angry
432.611	because someone looked at his girlfriend
434.364	or owes him money,
436.15	and you can find workers and train them
438.619	into these specialized categories.
441.733	And the second thing to do, of course,
443.383	is to prevent further spread,
444.884	that means to find who else has been exposed,
448.406	but may not be spreading so much right now
450.851	like someone with a smaller case of T.B.,
453.377	or someone who is just hanging out in the neighborhoods,
456.231	but in the same group,
457.857	and then they need to be, in a way,
460.154	managed as well,
461.527	particular to the specific disease process.
464.878	And then the third part, the shifting the norms,
467.931	and that means a whole bunch of community activities,
471.231	remodeling, public education,
473.572	and then you've got what you might call
475.709	group immunity.
476.931	And that combination of factors
478.819	is how the AIDS epidemic in Uganda
481.181	was very successfully reversed.
483.618	And so what we decided to do in the year 2000
486.448	is kind of put this together in a way
488.368	by hiring in new categories of workers,
490.895	the first being violence interruptors.
493.47	And then we would put all of this into place
496.132	in one neighborhood
497.567	in what was the worst police district
499.977	in the United States at the time.
501.884	So violence interruptors hired from the same group,
504.627	credibility, trust, access,
507.612	just like the health workers in Somalia,
510.23	but designed for a different category,
512.497	and trained in persuasion,
514.469	cooling people down, buying time, reframing.
518.247	And then another category of worker,
520.213	the outreach workers, to keep people
522.753	in a way on therapy for six to 24 months.
526.123	Just like T.B., but the object is behavior change.
529.782	And then a bunch of community activities
531.59	for changing norms.
533.285	Now our first experiment of this
535.652	resulted in a 67-percent drop
538.329	in shootings and killings
539.8	in the West Garfield neighborhood of Chicago.
542.197	(Applause)
544.347	And this was a beautiful thing
545.707	for the neighborhood itself,
547.323	first 50 or 60 days, then 90 days,
550.215	and then there was unfortunately another shooting
551.994	in another 90 days,
553.513	and the moms were hanging out in the afternoon.
555.953	They were using parks they weren't using before.
558.351	The sun was out. Everybody was happy.
560.488	"But of course, the funders said, ""Wait a second,"
563.678	"do it again."""
565.005	And so we had to then, fortunately,
568.322	get the funds to repeat this experience,
571.081	and this is one of the next four neighborhoods
573.092	that had a 45-percent drop in shootings and killings.
576.112	And since that time, this has been replicated
580.504	There have been independent evaluations
582.585	supported by the Justice Department
584.531	and by the CDC and performed by Johns Hopkins
587.308	that have shown 30-to-50-percent and 40-to-70-percent
591.102	reductions in shootings and killings
593.211	using this new method.
595.133	In fact, there have been three independent
596.58	evaluations of this now.
598.698	Now we've gotten a lot of attention as a result of this,
600.955	including being featured on
603.151	The New York Times' Sunday magazine cover story.
607.096	The Economist in 2009
609.894	"said this is ""the approach that will come to prominence."""
612.108	And even a movie was made around our work.
614.445	[The Interrupters]
615.613	However, not so fast,
618.117	because a lot of people did not agree
619.979	with this way of going about it.
621.96	We got a lot of criticism,
623.923	a lot of opposition,
625.662	and a lot of opponents.
627.397	In other words, what do you mean, health problem?
630.248	What do you mean, epidemic?
632.834	What do you mean, no bad guys?
635.642	And there's whole industries designed
637.795	for managing bad people.
640.753	What do you mean, hiring people
643.796	who have backgrounds?
645.745	My business friends said,
650.244	"""Gary, you're being criticized tremendously."
653.591	"You must be doing something right."""
655.589	(Laughter)
657.598	"My musician friends added the word ""dude."""
660.853	So anyway, additionally,
664.624	there was still this problem,
666.449	and we were getting highly criticized as well
669.354	for not dealing with all of these other problems.
672.65	Yet we were able to manage malaria
675.78	and reduce HIV and reduce diarrheal diseases
678.532	in places with awful economies
680.47	without healing the economy.
682.29	So what's actually happened is,
684.825	although there is still some opposition,
687.27	the movement is clearly growing.
689.09	Many of the major cities in the U.S.,
691.174	including New York City and Baltimore
693.412	and Kansas City,
694.677	their health departments are running this now.
696.61	Chicago and New Orleans, the health departments
699.231	are having a very large role in this.
701.762	This is being embraced more by law enforcement
704.617	than it had been years ago.
706.596	Trauma centers and hospitals
708.65	are doing their part in stepping up.
710.944	And the U.S. Conference of Mayors
712.837	has endorsed not only the approach
715.43	but the specific model.
717.723	Where there's really been uptake even faster
720.972	is in the international environment,
722.969	where there's a 55-percent drop
724.725	in the first neighborhood in Puerto Rico,
727.149	where interruptions are just beginning in Honduras,
729.955	where the strategy has been applied in Kenya
732.869	for the recent elections,
735.515	and where there have been 500 interruptions in Iraq.
738.688	So violence is responding as a disease
741.963	even as it behaves as a disease.
744.228	So the theory, in a way,
746.431	is kind of being validated by the treatment.
750.596	And recently, the Institute of Medicine
753.53	came out with a workshop report
755.667	which went through some of the data,
757.531	including the neuroscience,
759.076	on how this problem is really transmitted.
763.399	So I think this is good news,
766.31	because it allows us an opportunity
768.174	to come out of the Middle Ages,
769.729	which is where I feel this field has been.
772.771	It gives us an opportunity to consider the possibility
775.877	of replacing some of these prisons
778.673	with playgrounds or parks,
781.955	and to consider the possibility
784.623	of converting our neighborhoods into neighborhoods,
788.31	and to allow there to be a new strategy,
791.764	a new set of methods, a new set of workers:
795.625	science, in a way, replacing morality.
799.04	And moving away from emotions
801.424	is the most important part of the solution
804.611	to science as a more important part of the solution.
808.929	So I didn't mean to come up with this at all.
813.652	It was a matter of,
816.154	I wanted actually a break,
817.985	and we looked at maps, we looked at graphs,
822.096	we asked some questions
823.733	and tried some tools
826.929	that actually have been used many times before
829.486	for other things.
831.404	For myself, I tried to get away from
834.659	infectious diseases,
836.402	and I didn't.
838.357	Thank you.
839.984	(Applause)
