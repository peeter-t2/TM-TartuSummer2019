13.53	I'd like you all
15.063	to ask yourselves a question
17.731	which you may never have
17.731	asked yourselves before:
21.298	What is possible with the human voice?
25.661	What is possible with the human voice?
33.909	(Beatboxing)
57.208	♪ Ooh baby ♪
60.862	♪ baby ♪
63.181	♪ baby ♪
65.336	♪ baby ♪ (Baby crying)
67.906	♪ baby ♪ (Baby crying)
70.218	♪ baby ♪ (Cat meowing)
75.884	(Dog barking)
82.799	Yeah.
84.08	(Applause)
91.943	(Boomerang noises)
99.343	It was coming straight for me.
99.343	I had to. It was, yeah.
103.216	As you can probably well imagine,
106.328	I was a strange child.
108.927	(Laughter)
115.418	Because the thing is,
115.418	I was constantly trying
118.329	to extend my repertoire of noises to be
122.463	the very maximum that it could be.
125.023	I was constantly experimenting
125.023	with these noises.
127.381	And I'm still on that mission.
129.359	I'm still trying to find every noise
131.165	that I can possibly make.
133.464	And the thing is, I'm a bit
133.464	older and wiser now,
135.728	and I know that there's some noises
137.419	I'll never be able to make
137.419	because I'm hemmed in
139.729	by my physical body,
139.729	and there's things it can't do.
143.127	And there's things that no
143.127	one's voice can do.
145.342	For example, no one can do
145.342	two notes at the same time.
148.776	You can do two-tone singing,
150.441	which monks can do, which is like...
153.99	(Two-tone singing)
163.883	But that's cheating.
166.489	And it hurts your throat.
168.355	So there's things you can't
168.355	do, and these limitations
171.566	on the human voice have
171.566	always really annoyed me,
174.864	because beatbox is the best way of getting
178.128	musical ideas out of your head
178.128	and into the world,
181.55	but they're sketches at best,
183.442	which is what's annoyed me.
185.184	If only, if only there was a way
187.612	for these ideas to come out unimpeded
190.413	by the restrictions
190.413	which my body gives it.
195.099	So I've been working with these guys,
197.488	and we've made a machine.
201.273	We've made a system which is basically
203.62	a live production machine,
206.946	a real-time music production machine,
210.663	and it enables me to, using
210.663	nothing but my voice,
214.598	create music in real time
214.598	as I hear it in my head
218.9	unimpeded by any physical restrictions
221.418	that my body might place on me.
223.524	And I'm going to show you what it can do.
227.397	And before I start making noises with it,
231.283	and using it to manipulate my voice,
233.701	I want to reiterate that everything
233.701	that you're about to hear
236.63	is being made by my voice.
240.236	This system has --
243.193	thank you, beautiful assistant --
245.599	this system has no sounds in it itself
250.759	until I start putting sounds in it,
252.583	so there's no prerecorded
252.583	samples of any kind.
256.439	So once this thing really gets going,
258.74	and it really starts to mangle
258.74	the audio I'm putting into it,
261.669	it becomes not obvious
261.669	that it is the human voice,
264.623	but it is, so I'm going to take
264.623	you through it bit by bit
267.362	and start nice and simple.
269.089	So the polyphony problem:
269.089	I've only got one voice.
271.512	How do I get around the problem
273.676	of really wanting to have
273.676	as many different voices
275.95	going on at the same time.
277.213	The simplest way to do it
277.213	is something like this.
279.571	(Beatboxing)
285.375	By dancing. It's like this.
287.35	(Music)
319.186	Thanks.
320.615	(Applause)
322.968	So that's probably the easiest way.
326.214	But if you want to do something
326.214	a little bit more immediate,
329.58	something that you can't
329.58	achieve with live looping,
331.24	there's other ways to layer your voice up.
333.264	There's things like pitch-shifting,
335.208	which are awesome,
336.887	and I'm going to show you
336.887	now what that sounds like.
338.775	So I'm going to start
338.775	another beat for you, like this.
341.384	(Beatboxing)
349.084	There's always got to be a bit
349.084	of a dance at the start,
350.749	because it's just fun, so
352.382	you can clap along if you want.
354.912	You don't have to. It's fine.
354.912	Check it out.
357.455	I'm going to lay down a bass sound now.
361.735	(Music)
371.543	And now, a rockabilly guitar.
387.127	Which is nice. But what if I want
387.127	to make, say, a -- (Applause) --
391.158	Thanks. What if I want
391.158	to make, say, a rock organ?
393.821	Is that possible? Yes, it is,
396.735	by recording myself like this.
398.919	(Organ sound)
401.887	And now I have that, I have that recorded.
406.443	Assign it to a keyboard.
407.967	(Music)
411.597	So that's cool.
413.366	(Applause)
415.354	But what if I wanted to sound
415.354	like the whole of Pink Floyd?
421.23	Impossible, you say. No.
423.999	It is possible, and you
423.999	can do it very simply
426.838	using this machine. It's really fantastic.
426.838	Check it out.
430.806	(Music)
464.609	So every noise you can
464.609	hear there is my voice.
467.973	I didn't just trigger something
467.973	which sounds like that.
472.145	There's no samples.
472.145	There's no synthesizers.
474.265	That is literally all my voice
474.265	being manipulated,
477.189	and when you get to that point,
477.189	you have to ask, don't you,
481.088	what's the point?
482.876	Why do this? (Laughter)
486.997	Because it's cheaper than hiring
486.997	the whole of Pink Floyd,
489.736	I suppose, is the easy answer.
491.452	But in actual fact,
491.452	I haven't made this machine
495.108	so that I can emulate
495.108	things that already exist.
497.924	I've made this so that I can make
500.185	any noise that I can imagine.
501.59	So with your permission, I'm going to do
504.57	some things that are in my mind,
506.851	and I hope you enjoy them,
508.43	because they're rather unusual,
510.6	especially when you're
510.6	doing things which are
513.573	as unusual as this, it
513.573	can be hard to believe
517.089	that it is all my voice, you see.
518.968	(Voice effects)
532.177	(Music)
553.331	Like this.
555.419	(Music)
646.572	So, loosely defined,
650.673	that is what's possible
650.673	with the human voice.
654.523	Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
656.547	(Applause)
