15.91	I have a friend in Portugal
18.158	whose grandfather built a vehicle out of a bicycle
20.582	and a washing machine so he could transport his family.
23.734	He did it because he couldn't afford a car,
26.278	but also because he knew how to build one.
29.182	There was a time when we understood how things worked
32.318	and how they were made, so we could build and repair them,
36.15	or at the very least
37.277	make informed decisions about what to buy.
40.757	Many of these do-it-yourself practices
43.149	were lost in the second half of the 20th century.
46.358	But now, the maker community and the open-source model
50.03	are bringing this kind of knowledge about how things work
53.178	and what they're made of back into our lives,
56.373	and I believe we need to take them to the next level,
59.397	to the components things are made of.
62.365	For the most part, we still know
64.517	what traditional materials like paper and textiles are made of
68.039	and how they are produced.
70.068	But now we have these amazing, futuristic composites --
74.131	plastics that change shape,
76.334	paints that conduct electricity,
78.686	pigments that change color, fabrics that light up.
83.102	Let me show you some examples.
89.429	So conductive ink allows us to paint circuits
93.145	instead of using the traditional
95.088	printed circuit boards or wires.
97.686	In the case of this little example I'm holding,
100.075	we used it to create a touch sensor that reacts to my skin
103.956	by turning on this little light.
106.671	Conductive ink has been used by artists,
109.766	but recent developments indicate that we will soon be able
113.141	to use it in laser printers and pens.
117.636	And this is a sheet of acrylic infused
119.966	with colorless light-diffusing particles.
122.762	What this means is that, while regular acrylic
125.379	only diffuses light around the edges,
127.727	this one illuminates across the entire surface
130.997	when I turn on the lights around it.
133.91	Two of the known applications for this material
136.212	include interior design and multi-touch systems.
141.325	And thermochromic pigments
143.326	change color at a given temperature.
145.939	So I'm going to place this on a hot plate
148.725	that is set to a temperature only slightly higher than ambient
152.23	and you can see what happens.
158.076	So one of the principle applications for this material
160.836	is, amongst other things, in baby bottles,
164.078	so it indicates when the contents are cool enough to drink.
169.432	So these are just a few of what are commonly known
172.188	as smart materials.
174.097	In a few years, they will be in many of the objects
177.037	and technologies we use on a daily basis.
180.396	We may not yet have the flying cars science fiction promised us,
184.61	but we can have walls that change color
186.979	depending on temperature,
188.741	keyboards that roll up,
190.635	and windows that become opaque at the flick of a switch.
195.067	So I'm a social scientist by training,
197.572	so why am I here today talking about smart materials?
201.429	Well first of all, because I am a maker.
204.142	I'm curious about how things work
206.548	and how they are made,
208.175	but also because I believe we should have a deeper understanding
211.483	of the components that make up our world,
214.304	and right now, we don't know enough about
216.784	these high-tech composites our future will be made of.
220.473	Smart materials are hard to obtain in small quantities.
223.998	There's barely any information available on how to use them,
228.038	and very little is said about how they are produced.
231.935	So for now, they exist mostly in this realm
234.602	of trade secrets and patents
237.314	only universities and corporations have access to.
241.426	So a little over three years ago, Kirsty Boyle and I
244.275	started a project we called Open Materials.
247.492	It's a website where we,
249.299	and anyone else who wants to join us,
251.811	share experiments, publish information,
254.867	encourage others to contribute whenever they can,
258.067	and aggregate resources such as research papers
262.076	and tutorials by other makers like ourselves.
265.416	We would like it to become a large,
268.038	collectively generated database
270.576	of do-it-yourself information on smart materials.
274.869	But why should we care
277.089	how smart materials work and what they are made of?
280.852	First of all, because we can't shape what we don't understand,
285.03	and what we don't understand and use
287.382	ends up shaping us.
289.59	The objects we use, the clothes we wear,
292.342	the houses we live in, all have a profound impact
295.906	on our behavior, health and quality of life.
299.489	So if we are to live in a world made of smart materials,
302.63	we should know and understand them.
305.989	Secondly, and just as important,
308.333	innovation has always been fueled by tinkerers.
311.693	So many times, amateurs, not experts,
315.078	have been the inventors and improvers
317.397	of things ranging from mountain bikes
319.877	to semiconductors, personal computers,
323.189	airplanes.
326.128	The biggest challenge is that material science is complex
330.157	and requires expensive equipment.
332.653	But that's not always the case.
334.821	Two scientists at University of Illinois understood this
338.409	when they published a paper on a simpler method
341.009	for making conductive ink.
343.429	Jordan Bunker, who had had
345.341	no experience with chemistry until then,
348.301	read this paper and reproduced the experiment
351.088	at his maker space using only off-the-shelf substances
355.477	and tools.
357.069	He used a toaster oven,
358.67	and he even made his own vortex mixer,
361.636	based on a tutorial by another scientist/maker.
365.671	Jordan then published his results online,
368.423	including all the things he had tried and didn't work,
371.911	so others could study and reproduce it.
375.055	So Jordan's main form of innovation
377.727	was to take an experiment created in a well-equipped lab
381.606	at the university
383.108	and recreate it in a garage in Chicago
386.295	using only cheap materials and tools he made himself.
390.556	And now that he published this work,
392.829	others can pick up where he left
394.553	and devise even simpler processes and improvements.
399.097	Another example I'd like to mention
401.313	is Hannah Perner-Wilson's Kit-of-No-Parts.
404.978	Her project's goal is to highlight
407.858	the expressive qualities of materials
410.33	while focusing on the creativity and skills of the builder.
415.354	Electronics kits are very powerful
417.794	in that they teach us how things work,
420.346	but the constraints inherent in their design
423.322	influence the way we learn.
425.482	So Hannah's approach, on the other hand,
427.97	is to formulate a series of techniques
431.186	for creating unusual objects
433.885	that free us from pre-designed constraints
436.69	by teaching us about the materials themselves.
440.101	So amongst Hannah's many impressive experiments,
442.834	this is one of my favorites.
444.804	"[""Paper speakers""]"
448.221	What we're seeing here is just a piece of paper
451.499	with some copper tape on it connected to an mp3 player
455.941	and a magnet.
457.594	"(Music: ""Happy Together"")"
468.191	So based on the research by Marcelo Coelho from MIT,
472.027	Hannah created a series of paper speakers
474.81	out of a wide range of materials
477.213	from simple copper tape to conductive fabric and ink.
481.488	Just like Jordan and so many other makers,
484.224	Hannah published her recipes
485.851	and allows anyone to copy and reproduce them.
490.985	But paper electronics is one of the most promising branches
494.189	of material science
495.996	in that it allows us to create cheaper and flexible electronics.
500.198	So Hannah's artisanal work,
502.754	and the fact that she shared her findings,
505.002	opens the doors to a series of new possibilities
508.822	that are both aesthetically appealing and innovative.
514.262	So the interesting thing about makers
517.167	is that we create out of passion and curiosity,
520.21	and we are not afraid to fail.
522.289	We often tackle problems from unconventional angles,
526.177	and, in the process, end up discovering alternatives
529.166	or even better ways to do things.
531.598	So the more people experiment with materials,
535.366	the more researchers are willing to share their research,
538.842	and manufacturers their knowledge,
541.282	the better chances we have to create technologies
544.122	that truly serve us all.
547.06	So I feel a bit as Ted Nelson must have
549.553	when, in the early 1970s, he wrote,
553.264	"""You must understand computers now."""
556.262	Back then, computers were these large mainframes
560.116	only scientists cared about,
562.246	and no one dreamed of even having one at home.
564.966	So it's a little strange that I'm standing here and saying,
567.942	"""You must understand smart materials now."""
570.982	Just keep in mind that acquiring preemptive knowledge
574.718	about emerging technologies
576.982	is the best way to ensure that we have a say
579.379	in the making of our future.
581.542	Thank you.
584.013	(Applause)
