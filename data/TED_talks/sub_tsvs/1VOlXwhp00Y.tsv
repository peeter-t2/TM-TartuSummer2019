27	Well, as Alexander Graham Bell famously said
31	on his first successful telephone call,
34	"""Hello, is that Domino's Pizza?"""
37	(Laughter)
39	I just really want to thank you very much.
43	As another famous man, Jerry Garcia, said,
45	"""What a strange, long trip."""
49	And he should have said,
51	"""What a strange, long trip it's about to become."""
54	At this very moment, you are viewing my upper half.
58	My lower half is appearing at a different conference
61	(Laughter)
63	in a different country.
67	You can, it turns out, be in two places at once.
72	But still, I'm sorry I can't be with you in person.
75	I'll explain at another time.
77	And though I'm a rock star,
79	I just want to assure you that none of my wishes will include a hot tub.
84	But what really turns me on about technology
87	is not just the ability to get more songs on MP3 players.
92	The revolution -- this revolution -- is much bigger than that.
97	I hope, I believe.
100	What turns me on about the digital age,
103	what excites me personally,
105	is that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing.
112	You see, it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song,
115	you needed a studio and a producer.
120	Now, you need a laptop.
122	If you wanted to make a film, you needed a mass of equipment
126	and a Hollywood budget.
128	Now, you need a camera that fits in your palm,
132	and a couple of bucks for a blank DVD.
135	Imagination has been decoupled from the old constraints.
140	And that really, really excites me.
143	I'm excited when I glimpse that kind of thinking writ large.
148	What I would like to see is idealism decoupled from all constraints.
156	Political, economic, psychological, whatever.
160	The geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world.
165	From the ease with which you swept away obstacles
168	that no one knew could even be budged.
171	And that's actually what I'd like to talk about today.
176	First, though, I should probably explain why, and how,
181	I got to this place.
185	It's a journey that started 20 years ago.
192	"You may remember that song, ""We Are the World,"""
194	"or, ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"""
196	Band Aid, Live Aid.
198	Another very tall, grizzled rock star, my friend Sir Bob Geldof,
203	"issued a challenge to ""feed the world."""
208	It was a great moment, and it utterly changed my life.
213	That summer, my wife, Ali, and myself went to Ethiopia.
219	We went on the quiet to see for ourselves what was going on.
223	We lived in Ethiopia for a month, working at an orphanage.
227	The children had a name for me.
229	"They called me, ""The girl with the beard."""
232	(Laughter)
234	Don't ask.
237	Anyway, we found Africa to be a magical place.
240	Big skies, big hearts, big, shining continent.
244	Beautiful, royal people.
247	Anybody who ever gave anything to Africa got a lot more back.
251	Ethiopia didn't just blow my mind; it opened my mind.
258	Anyway, on our last day at this orphanage
261	a man handed me his baby and said,
265	"""Would you take my son with you?"""
271	He knew, in Ireland, that his son would live,
274	and that in Ethiopia, his son would die.
278	It was the middle of that awful famine.
282	Well, I turned him down.
287	And it was a funny kind of sick feeling, but I turned him down.
294	And it's a feeling I can't ever quite forget.
298	And in that moment, I started this journey.
302	In that moment, I became the worst thing of all:
306	I became a rock star with a cause. (Laughter)
310	Except this isn't the cause, is it?
315	Six-and-a-half thousand Africans dying every single day from AIDS --
319	a preventable, treatable disease --
321	for lack of drugs we can get in any pharmacy.
325	That's not a cause. That's an emergency.
333	That's not a cause. That's an emergency.
336	Today, every day, 9,000 more Africans
341	will catch HIV because of stigmatization and lack of education.
346	That's not a cause. That's an emergency.
351	So what we're talking about here is human rights.
356	The right to live like a human.
359	The right to live, period.
362	And what we're facing in Africa is
364	an unprecedented threat to human dignity and equality.
370	The next thing I'd like to be clear about is what this problem is,
373	and what this problem isn't.
377	Because this is not all about charity.
380	This is about justice. Really.
384	This is not about charity. This is about justice.
388	That's right.
390	And that's too bad, because we're very good at charity.
393	Americans, like Irish people, are good at it.
397	Even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford.
401	We like to give, and we give a lot.
403	Look at the response to the tsunami -- it's inspiring.
407	But justice is a tougher standard than charity.
412	You see, Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice.
417	It makes a farce of our idea of equality.
420	It mocks our pieties. It doubts our concern.
423	It questions our commitment.
426	Because there is no way we can look at what's happening in Africa,
430	and if we're honest,
432	conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else.
435	As you heard in the film, anywhere else, not here.
438	Not here, not in America, not in Europe.
442	In fact, a head of state that you're all familiar with
447	admitted this to me. And it's really true.
452	There is no chance this kind of hemorrhaging of human life
456	would be accepted anywhere else other than Africa.
461	Africa is a continent in flames.
465	And deep down, if we really accepted that Africans were equal to us,
468	we would all do more to put the fire out.
471	We're standing around with watering cans,
474	when what we really need is the fire brigade.
477	You see, it's not as dramatic as the tsunami.
483	It's crazy, really, when you think about it.
486	Does stuff have to look like an action movie these days
489	to exist in the front of our brain?
492	The slow extinguishing of countless lives
495	is just not dramatic enough, it would appear.
499	Catastrophes that we can avert
501	are not as interesting as ones we could avert.
506	Funny, that.
508	Anyway, I believe that that kind of thinking
511	offends the intellectual rigor in this room.
517	Six-and-a-half thousand people dying a day in Africa may be Africa's crisis,
522	but the fact that it's not on the nightly news,
525	that we in Europe, or you in America,
527	are not treating it like an emergency --
529	I want to argue with you tonight that that's our crisis.
533	I want to argue that though Africa is not the front line in the war against terror,
539	it could be soon.
541	Every week, religious extremists take another African village.
546	They're attempting to bring order to chaos.
548	Well, why aren't we?
551	Poverty breeds despair. We know this.
553	Despair breeds violence. We know this.
556	In turbulent times, isn't it cheaper, and smarter,
560	to make friends out of potential enemies
563	than to defend yourself against them later?
567	"""The war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty."""
574	And I didn't say that. Colin Powell said that.
577	Now when the military are telling us that this is a war
580	that cannot be won by military might alone,
583	maybe we should listen.
586	There's an opportunity here, and it's real.
589	It's not spin. It's not wishful thinking.
592	The problems facing the developing world
594	afford us in the developed world
596	a chance to re-describe ourselves to the world.
602	We will not only transform other people's lives,
604	but we will also transform the way those other lives see us.
608	And that might be smart in these nervous, dangerous times.
613	Don't you think that on a purely commercial level,
618	that anti-retroviral drugs are great advertisements
622	for Western ingenuity and technology?
625	Doesn't compassion look well on us?
627	And let's cut the crap for a second.
631	In certain quarters of the world, brand EU, brand USA,
637	is not at its shiniest.
641	The neon sign is fizzing and cracking.
644	Someone's put a brick through the window.
647	The regional branch managers are getting nervous.
651	Never before have we in the west been so scrutinized.
655	Our values: do we have any?
657	Our credibility?
659	These things are under attack around the world.
661	Brand USA could use some polishing.
666	And I say that as a fan, you know?
668	As a person who buys the products.
670	But think about it.
672	More anti-retrovirals make sense.
676	But that's just the easy part, or ought to be.
679	But equality for Africa --
684	that's a big, expensive idea.
688	You see, the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference.
692	What on earth can we all do about this?
697	Well, much more than we think.
699	We can't fix every problem, but the ones we can,
702	I want to argue, we must.
704	And because we can, we must.
708	This is the straight truth, the righteous truth.
713	It is not a theory.
715	The fact is that ours is the first generation
718	that can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye,
722	look across the ocean to Africa, and say this, and mean it:
726	we do not have to stand for this.
729	A whole continent written off -- we do not have to stand for this.
734	(Applause)
744	And let me say this without a trace of irony --
750	before I back it up to a bunch of ex-hippies.
753	Forget the '60s. We can change the world.
758	I can't; you can't, as individuals; but we can change the world.
764	I really believe that, the people in this room.
766	Look at the Gates Foundation.
768	They've done incredible stuff, unbelievable stuff.
771	But working together, we can actually change the world.
775	We can turn the inevitable outcomes,
778	and transform the quality of life for millions of lives
785	who look and feel rather like us, when you're up close.
791	I'm sorry to laugh here, but you do look so different
795	than you did in Haight-Ashbury in the '60s.
799	(Laughter)
802	But I want to argue that this is the moment that you are designed for.
808	It is the flowering of the seeds you planted
811	in earlier, headier days.
815	Ideas that you gestated in your youth.
819	This is what excites me.
821	This room was born for this moment,
825	is really what I want to say to you tonight.
827	Most of you started out wanting to change the world, didn't you?
831	Most of you did, the digital world.
834	Well, now, actually because of you,
837	it is possible to change the physical world.
840	It's a fact.
841	Economists confirm it, and they know much more than I do.
846	So why, then, are we not pumping our fists into the air?
853	Probably because when we admit we can do something about it,
857	we've got to do something about it.
861	It is a pain in the arse.
864	This equality business is actually a pain in the arse.
868	But for the first time in history, we have the technology;
873	we have the know-how; we have the cash;
875	we have the life-saving drugs.
879	Do we have the will?
881	I hope this is obvious, but I'm not a hippie.
887	And I'm not really one for the warm, fuzzy feeling.
890	I do not have flowers in my hair.
893	Actually, I come from punk rock.
896	The Clash wore big army boots, not sandals.
901	But I know toughness when I see it.
904	And for all the talk of peace and love on the West Coast,
907	there was muscle to the movement that started out here.
914	You see, idealism detached from action is just a dream.
920	But idealism allied with pragmatism,
924	with rolling up your sleeves and making the world bend a bit,
927	is very exciting. It's very real. It's very strong.
932	And it's very present in a crowd like you.
939	Last year at DATA, this organization I helped set up,
944	we launched a campaign to summon this spirit
947	in the fight against AIDS and extreme poverty.
950	We're calling it the ONE Campaign.
953	It's based on our belief that the action of one person
957	can change a lot,
959	but the actions of many coming together as one
963	can change the world.
965	Well, we feel that now is the time to prove we're right.
971	There are moments in history when civilization redefines itself.
976	We believe this is one.
978	We believe that this could be the time when the world finally decides
982	that the wanton loss of life in Africa is just no longer acceptable.
987	This could be the time that we finally get serious
990	about changing the future for most people who live on planet Earth.
997	Momentum has been building.
1000	Lurching a little, but it's building.
1003	This year is a test for us all,
1005	especially the leaders of the G8 nations,
1009	who really are on the line here,
1011	with all the world in history watching.
1014	I have been, of late, disappointed with the Bush Administration.
1019	They started out with such promise on Africa.
1022	They made some really great promises,
1025	and actually have fulfilled a lot of them.
1028	But some of them they haven't.
1031	They don't feel the push from the ground, is the truth.
1037	But my disappointment has much more perspective
1041	when I talk to American people,
1043	and I hear their worries about the deficit,
1046	and the fiscal well being of their country.
1048	I understand that.
1050	But there's much more push from the ground than you'd think,
1055	if we got organized.
1057	What I try to communicate, and you can help me if you agree,
1061	is that aid for Africa is just great value for money
1065	at a time when America really needs it.
1068	Putting it in the crassest possible terms,
1071	the investment reaps huge returns.
1075	Not only in lives saved, but in goodwill, stability
1079	and security that we'll gain.
1085	So this is what I hope that you will do, if I could be so bold,
1089	and not have it deducted from my number of wishes.
1094	(Laughter)
1097	What I hope is that beyond individual merciful acts,
1103	that you will tell the politicians to do right by Africa,
1108	by America and by the world.
1111	Give them permission, if you like,
1113	to spend their political capital and your financial capital,
1118	your national purse on saving the lives of millions of people.
1121	That's really what I would like you to do.
1125	Because we also need your intellectual capital:
1129	your ideas, your skills, your ingenuity.
1133	And you, at this conference, are in a unique position.
1137	Some of the technologies we've been talking about, you invented them,
1140	or at least revolutionized the way that they're used.
1144	Together you have changed the zeitgeist from analog to digital,
1148	and pushed the boundaries.
1152	And we'd like you to give us that energy.
1157	Give us that kind of dreaming, that kind of doing.
1160	As I say, there're two things on the line here.
1162	There's the continent Africa.
1166	But there's also our sense of ourselves.
1169	People are starting to figure this out.
1171	Movements are springing up.
1172	Artists, politicians, pop stars, priests, CEOs,
1175	NGOs, mothers' unions, student unions.
1180	A lot of people are getting together, and working
1182	under this umbrella I told you about earlier, the ONE Campaign.
1187	I think they just have one idea in their mind,
1194	which is, where you live in the world
1198	should not determine whether you live in the world.
1203	(Applause)
1207	History, like God, is watching what we do.
1212	When the history books get written,
1214	I think our age will be remembered for three things.
1218	Really, it's just three things this whole age will be remembered for.
1222	The digital revolution, yes.
1225	The war against terror, yes.
1228	And what we did or did not do to put out the fires in Africa.
1235	Some say we can't afford to. I say we can't afford not to.
1243	Thank you, thank you very much.
1245	(Applause)
1252	Okay, my three wishes.
1255	The ones that TED has offered to grant.
1261	You see, if this is true, and I believe it is,
1263	that the digital world you all created has uncoupled
1269	the creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter,
1275	this should be a piece of piss.
1277	(Laughter)
1281	I should add that this started out as a much longer list of wishes.
1284	Most of them impossible, some of them impractical
1286	and one or two of them certainly immoral.
1290	(Laughter)
1294	This business, it gets to be addictive, you know what I mean,
1298	when somebody else is picking up the tab.
1301	Anyway, here's number one.
1304	I wish for you to help build a social movement
1311	of more than one million American activists for Africa.
1318	That is my first wish.
1320	I believe it's possible.
1322	A few minutes ago, I talked about all the citizens' campaigns that are springing up.
1327	You know, there's lots out there.
1329	And with this one campaign as our umbrella,
1332	my organization, DATA, and other groups,
1335	have been tapping into the energy and the enthusiasm
1339	that's out there from Hollywood into the heartland of America.
1343	We know there's more than enough energy to power this movement.
1347	We just need your help in making it happen.
1351	We want all of you here, church America, corporate America,
1353	Microsoft America, Apple America, Coke America,
1356	Pepsi America, nerd America, noisy America.
1359	We can't afford to be cool and sit this one out.
1363	I do believe if we build a movement that's one million Americans strong,
1368	we're not going to be denied.
1371	We will have the ear of Congress.
1376	We'll be the first page in Condi Rice's briefing book,
1379	and right into the Oval Office.
1382	If there's one million Americans -- and I really know this --
1385	who are ready to make phone calls,
1387	who are ready to be on email,
1389	I am absolutely sure that we can actually change
1393	the course of history, literally, for the continent of Africa.
1399	Anyway, so I'd like your help in getting that signed up.
1403	I know John Gage and Sun Microsystems are already on board for this,
1407	but there's lots of you we'd like to talk to.
1410	Right, my second wish, number two.
1418	I would like one media hit for every person on the planet
1423	who is living on less than one dollar a day.
1428	That's one billion media hits.
1431	Could be on Google, could be on AOL.
1434	Steve Case, Larry, Sergey -- they've done a lot already.
1440	It could be NBC. It could be ABC.
1442	Actually we're talking to ABC today about the Oscars.
1445	We have a film, produced by Jon Kamen at Radical Media.
1451	But you know, we want, we need some airtime for our ideas.
1455	We need to get the math; we need to get the statistics out to the American people.
1459	I really believe that old Truman line,
1462	that if you give the American people the facts,
1465	they'll do the right thing.
1467	And, the other thing that's important is that this is not Sally Struthers.
1471	This has to be described as an adventure, not a burden.
1476	(Video): One by one they step forward,
1478	a nurse, a teacher, a homemaker,
1480	and lives are saved.
1482	The problem is enormous.
1484	Every three seconds one person dies.
1487	Another three seconds, one more.
1490	The situation is so desperate in parts of Africa,
1493	Asia, even America,
1495	that aid groups, just as they did for the tsunami,
1498	are uniting as one, acting as one.
1502	We can beat extreme poverty, starvation, AIDS.
1506	But we need your help.
1508	One more person, letter, voice
1510	will mean the difference between life and death
1513	for millions of people.
1516	Please join us by working together.
1518	Americans have an unprecedented opportunity.
1521	We can make history.
1523	We can start to make poverty history.
1526	One, by one, by one.
1528	Please visit ONE at this address.
1531	We're not asking for your money. We're asking for your voice.
1536	Bono: All right. I wish for TED to truly show the power of information,
1544	its power to rewrite the rules and transform lives,
1549	by connecting every hospital, health clinic and school
1555	in one African country.
1559	And I would like it to be Ethiopia.
1562	I believe we can connect every school in Ethiopia,
1566	every health clinic, every hospital --
1569	we can connect to the Internet.
1572	That is my wish, my third wish.
1574	I think it's possible.
1575	I think we have the money and brains in the room to do that.
1578	And that would be a mind-blowing wish to come true.
1584	I've been to Ethiopia, as I said earlier.
1587	It's actually where it all started for me.
1594	The idea that the Internet, which changed all of our lives,
1598	can transform a country -- and a continent
1602	that has hardly made it to analog, let alone digital -- blows my mind.
1609	But it didn't start out that way.
1612	The first long-distance line from Boston to New York
1615	was used in 1885 on the phone.
1621	It was just nine years later that Addis Ababa
1625	was connected by phone to Harare, which is 500 kilometers away.
1632	Since then, not that much has changed.
1635	The average waiting time to get a landline in Ethiopia
1639	is actually about seven or eight years.
1643	But wireless technology wasn't dreamt up then.
1649	Anyway, I'm Irish, and as you can see,
1651	I know how important talking is.
1655	Communication is very important for Ethiopia -- will transform the country.
1659	Nurses getting better training,
1661	pharmacists being able to order supplies,
1663	doctors sharing their expertise in all aspects of medicine.
1668	It's a very, very good idea to get them wired.
1672	And that is my third and final wish for you at the TED conference.
1676	Thank you very much once again.
1678	(Applause)
