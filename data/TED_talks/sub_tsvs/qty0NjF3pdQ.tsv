12.681	Caitlin Quattromani: The election
12.681	of 2016 felt different.
16.398	Political conversations
16.398	with our family and friends
19.445	uncovered a level of polarization
21.255	that many of us had not
21.255	previously experienced.
24.49	People who we always thought
24.49	were reasonable and intelligent
28.037	seemed like strangers.
29.646	We said to ourselves,
29.646	"""How could you think that?"
32.329	"I thought you were smart."""
34.225	Lauran Arledge: Caitlin and I met
34.225	in the summer of 2011,
37.642	and we bonded around being working moms
39.556	and trying to keep
39.556	our very energetic boys busy.
42.646	And we soon found out
42.646	we had almost everything in common.
46.138	From our love of Colorado
46.138	to our love of sushi,
49.655	there wasn't much we didn't agree on.
52.481	We also discovered that we share
52.481	a deep love of this country
55.498	and feel a responsibility
55.498	to be politically active.
59.076	But no one's perfect --
60.751	(Laughter)
61.823	and I soon found out
61.823	two disappointing things about Caitlin.
65.85	First, she hates camping.
68.497	CQ: I think camping is the worst.
70.569	LA: So there would not be
70.569	any joint camping trips in our future.
74.901	The second thing is that
74.901	she's politically active all right --
78.585	as a conservative.
80.41	CQ: I may hate camping,
80.41	but I love politics.
83.736	I listen to conservative talk radio
83.736	just about every day,
86.965	and I've volunteered for a few different
86.965	conservative political campaigns.
91.131	LA: And I'd say I'm a little to the left,
93.457	like all the way to the left.
94.895	(Laughter)
96.498	I've always been interested in politics.
98.618	I was a political science major,
100.22	and I worked as a community organizer
100.22	and on a congressional campaign.
103.998	CQ: So as Lauran and I
103.998	were getting to know each other,
106.672	it was right in the middle
106.672	of that 2012 presidential campaign,
109.619	and most of our early
109.619	political conversations
112.136	were really just based
112.136	in jokes and pranks.
115.064	So as an example, I would change
115.064	Lauran's computer screen saver
118.12	to a picture of Mitt Romney,
119.573	or she would put an Obama
119.573	campaign magnet on the back of my car.
122.994	(Laughter)
124.029	LA: Car, not minivan.
126.093	CQ: But over time,
126.093	those conversations grew more serious
129.125	and really became
129.125	a core of our friendship.
131.808	And somewhere along the line,
133.25	we decided we didn't want to have
133.25	any topic be off limits for discussion,
137.253	even if those topics pushed us way
137.253	outside of our friendship comfort zone.
141.731	LA: And so to most of us,
142.959	political conversations
142.959	are a zero-sum game.
145.579	There's a winner and there's a loser.
147.58	We go for the attack and we spot
147.58	a weakness in someone's argument.
150.857	And here's the important part:
152.364	we tend to take every comment
152.364	or opinion that's expressed
155.484	as a personal affront
155.484	to our own values and beliefs.
159.337	But what if changed the way
159.337	we think about these conversations?
163.035	What if, in these heated moments,
165.321	we chose dialogue over debate?
168.606	When we engage in dialogue,
168.606	we flip the script.
172.118	We replace our ego and our desire to win
174.919	with curiosity, empathy
177.022	and a desire to learn.
178.531	Instead of coming
178.531	from a place of judgment,
180.621	we are genuinely interested
180.621	in the other person's experiences,
184.517	their values and their concerns.
187.04	CQ: You make it sound so simple, Lauran.
189.601	But getting to that place
189.601	of true dialogue is hard,
192.446	especially when we're talking
192.446	about politics.
194.881	It is so easy to get emotionally fired up
197.52	about issues that we're passionate about,
199.66	and we can let our ego
199.66	get in the way of truly hearing
202.619	the other person's perspective.
204.376	And in this crazy political climate
204.376	we're in right now,
206.973	unfortunately, we're seeing
206.973	an extreme result
209.789	of those heated political conversations,
212.159	to the point where people are willing
212.159	to walk away from their relationships.
216.152	In fact, Rasmussen released
216.152	a poll earlier this year
219.145	that said 40 percent of people
219.145	reported that the 2016 election
223.883	negatively impacted
223.883	a personal relationship,
226.931	and the Journal of Cognitive
226.931	Neuroscience tells us
229.391	that people tend to feel
229.391	their way to their beliefs
232.344	rather than using reasoning,
234.081	and that when reason and emotion collide,
237.162	it's emotion that invariably wins.
239.606	So no wonder it's hard
239.606	to talk about these issues.
242.209	LA: And look, we're just
242.209	two regular friends
244.282	who happen to think very differently
246.616	about politics and the role
246.616	that government should play in our lives.
250.235	And I know we were all taught
250.235	not to talk about politics
252.895	because it's not polite,
254.363	but we need to be able to talk about it,
256.3	because it's important to us
256.3	and it's a part of who we are.
259.479	CQ: We have chosen
259.479	to avoid political debate
262.265	and instead engage in dialogue
264.512	in order to maintain what we fondly call
267.077	our bipartisan friendship.
268.878	(Laughter)
270.632	LA: And this election
270.632	and all of the craziness that has followed
273.664	has given us several opportunities
273.664	to practice this skill.
276.717	(Laughter)
278.583	Let's start with January
278.583	and the Women's March.
280.799	At this point, you can probably guess
280.799	which one of us participated.
284.25	(Laughter)
285.617	CQ: Oh, the Women's March.
287.61	I was annoyed and irritated
287.61	that entire day,
290.436	really because of two things.
292.251	"Number one, the name ""Women's March."""
295.14	As a conservative woman,
296.4	the march's platform of issues
296.4	didn't represent me,
299.416	and that's OK,
300.614	but hearing it talked about
300.614	as this demonstration of sisterhood
303.909	and solidarity for all women
305.6	didn't ring true for me.
307.283	The other piece
307.283	was the timing of the event,
309.356	the fact that it was the day
309.356	after the presidential inauguration.
312.688	It felt like we weren't even
312.688	giving the new administration
315.428	to actually do anything, good or bad,
317.605	before people felt the need
317.605	to demonstrate against it.
320.706	LA: And under normal circumstances,
320.706	I would agree with Caitlin.
323.684	I think an administration
323.684	does deserve the benefit of the doubt.
326.709	But in this case, I was marching
326.709	to show my concern
330	that a man with such a poor track record
330	with women and other groups
333.493	had been elected as president.
335.645	I had to be part of the collective voice
337.637	that wanted to send a clear message
337.637	to the new president
340.603	that we did not accept or condone
342.891	his behavior or rhetoric
342.891	during the election.
345.885	CQ: So I'm already feeling
345.885	kind of aggravated,
348.467	and then I see this Facebook from Lauran
348.467	pop up in my social media feed.
352.904	(Laughter)
353.935	Seeing Lauran's sons at the march
353.935	and holding signs
357.276	took it to a new level for me,
357.276	and not in a good way,
360.594	because I know these boys,
362.214	I love these boys,
363.674	and I didn't feel they were old enough
365.58	to understand what the march stood for.
367.516	I didn't understand
367.516	why Lauran would choose
369.587	to have them participate in that way,
371.404	and I assumed it wasn't a choice
371.404	that the boys made for themselves.
374.752	But I also know Lauran.
377.154	You're an incredible mom
378.393	who would never exploit
378.393	your boys in any way,
380.952	so I had to stop and check myself.
382.723	I had a decision to make.
384.411	I could take the easy way out
386.039	and just choose
386.039	not to say anything to her,
388.813	and instead just kind of simmer
388.813	in my frustration,
391.854	or I could ask her to learn more
391.854	about her motivations.
395.085	LA: And I shared with Caitlin
396.491	that we actually started
396.491	talking about the March
398.824	weeks before we participated.
400.494	And my boys were curious
400.494	as to why the event was being organized,
403.722	and this led to some
403.722	very interesting family conversations.
407.403	We talked about how in this country,
407.403	we have the right and the privilege
410.951	to demonstrate against
410.951	something we don't agree with,
413.697	and my husband shared with them
413.697	why he thought it was so important
416.833	that men joined the Women's March.
418.807	But the most significant reason
418.807	we marched as a family
421.712	is that it was a way for us to honor
421.712	my parents' legacy.
425.187	They spent their careers
426.684	working to defend the rights
426.684	of some of our most vulnerable citizens,
430.592	and they passed these values
430.592	down to me and my brother,
433.189	and we want to do the same with our sons.
435.367	CQ: After talking to Lauran,
436.73	I really understood not only
436.73	why she felt it was so important to march,
440.611	but why she had her boys with her.
442.524	And frankly, my assumptions were wrong.
444.795	It was the boys who wanted to march
446.524	after they talked about
446.524	the issues as a family.
449.163	But what's most important
449.163	about this example
451.295	is to think about the alternative.
453.12	Had Lauran and I not talked about it,
454.963	I would have been annoyed with her,
456.655	and it could have resulted
456.655	in an undercurrent of disrespect
459.456	in our friendship.
460.646	But by asking Lauran questions,
460.646	it allowed us to use dialogue
463.824	to get to a place of true understanding.
466.203	Now, to be clear,
467.796	our conversation didn't really change
467.796	my mind about how I felt about the March,
471.685	but it absolutely changed my thinking
471.685	around why she brought her boys with her.
475.849	And for both of us,
475.849	that dialogue allowed us to understand
478.858	each other's perspective
478.858	about the Women's March
481.151	even though we disagreed.
483.135	LA: The second topic that challenged
483.135	our ability to engage in dialogue
486.774	was around my need to understand
488.811	how Caitlin could vote for Trump.
491.318	(Laughter)
497.303	Caitlin is a successful professional woman
500.752	who is deeply caring and compassionate,
503.383	and the Caitlin I know
504.788	would never excuse any man
504.788	from talking about women
507.971	the way that Trump did
507.971	during the campaign.
510.571	It was hard for me to reconcile
510.571	these two things in my mind.
513.654	How could you overlook
513.654	the things that were said?
516.757	CQ: So I'm guessing I may not be
516.757	the only one here that thought
519.735	we didn't have the best choices
519.735	for the presidential election last year.
523.141	(Laughter)
524.584	The Republican candidate who I did support
524.584	didn't make it out of the primary,
528.504	so when it came time to vote,
528.504	I had a decision to make.
531.604	And you're right,
531.604	there were some terrible things
533.915	that came out during the Trump campaign,
536.052	so much so that I almost decided
536.052	to just abstain
538.599	rather than voting for president,
540.208	something I had never
540.208	even considered doing before.
542.986	But ultimately,
542.986	I did vote for Donald Trump,
545.209	and for me it was really a vote
545.209	for party over person,
548.754	especially recognizing
548.754	how important that presidential pick is
552.5	on influencing our judicial branch.
555.148	But I shared with Lauran
555.148	it was a decision I really wrestled with,
558.347	and not one that I made lightly.
560.676	LA: And so after our conversation,
560.676	I was struck by a few things.
564.107	First, I had fallen victim
564.107	to my own confirmation bias.
567.846	Because of my strong feelings about Trump,
570.218	I had given all Trump voters
570.218	the same attributes,
572.91	and none of them forgiving.
574.498	(Laughter)
575.672	But knowing Caitlin,
575.672	I started to ask questions.
579.846	What were Trump voters
579.846	really concerned about?
582.36	Under all the divisive language,
582.36	what was really going on?
586.003	What could we learn
586.003	about ourselves and our country
588.732	from this unlikely event?
591.156	I also learned that we shared
591.156	a deep disappointment in this election,
595.538	and that we have growing concerns
595.538	about our two-party political system.
599.635	But the most important thing
599.635	about this conversation
602.274	is that it happened at all.
604.894	Without an open and honest dialogue
604.894	between the two of us,
608.306	this election would have been
608.306	the elephant in the room
610.982	for the next four years, pun intended.
613.671	(Laughter)
618.115	CQ: So, look --
619.29	(Applause)
621.576	So, look -- we know it takes work
621.576	to get past the difficult,
624.989	frustrating and sometimes emotional parts
627.378	of having discussions about issues
627.378	like the Women's March
630.363	or why your friend may have voted
630.363	for a candidate that you can't stand.
635.072	But we need to have these conversations.
637.311	Our ability to move past political debate
639.882	into true dialogue
641.382	is a critical skill we should all
641.382	be focused on right now,
644.408	especially with the people
644.408	that we care about the most.
647.724	LA: And it's not just as adults
647.724	that we need to bottle this behavior.
651.011	It's critical that we do it
651.011	for our children as well.
654.023	My sons were inundated with this election.
656.717	We were listening
656.717	to the news in the morning,
658.885	and they were having conversations
658.885	with their friends at school.
662.38	I was concerned that they were picking up
662.38	so much polarizing misinformation,
666.524	and they were growing really fearful
666.524	of a Trump presidency.
670.554	Then one day, after the election,
670.554	I was taking my sons to school,
675.079	and my younger son,
675.079	completely out of the blue,
677.572	"said, ""Mom, we don't know anybody"
677.572	"who voted for Trump, right?"""
682.5	(Laughter)
685.493	And I paused and I took a deep breath.
690.063	"""Yes, we do."""
691.269	(Laughter)
692.293	"""The Quattromanis."""
693.764	And his response was so great.
695.857	He kind of got this confused
695.857	look on his face, and he said ...
699.539	"""But we love them."""
700.714	(Laughter)
703.706	"And I answered, ""Yes, we do."""
705.523	(Laughter)
706.601	And then he said,
706.601	"""Why would they vote for him?"""
710.232	And I remember stopping and thinking
711.972	that it was really important
711.972	how I answered this question.
715.409	Somehow, I had to honor
715.409	our own family values
718.195	and show respect for our friends.
720.697	So I finally said,
722.293	"""They think that's the right direction"
722.293	"for this country."""
724.985	And before I had even gotten
724.985	the whole sentence out,
727.803	he had moved on to the soccer game
727.803	he was going to play at recess.
730.97	CQ: So life with boys.
732.166	(Laughter)
733.223	So what Lauran and I have discovered
733.223	through our bipartisan friendship
736.607	is the possibility that lives in dialogue.
739.611	We have chosen to be genuinely curious
741.977	about each other's ideas and perspectives
744.679	and to be willing to listen to one another
744.679	even when we disagree.
748.523	And by putting aside our ego
748.523	and our preconceived ideas,
751.672	we've opened ourselves up
751.672	to limitless learning.
754.602	And perhaps most importantly
754.602	for our relationship,
757.428	we have made the commitment to each other
759.484	that our friendship is way more important
762.373	than either of us being right
762.373	or winning a conversation about politics.
767.02	So today, we're asking you
767.02	to have a conversation.
770.225	Talk to someone outside
770.225	of your political party
772.516	who might challenge your thinking.
774.161	Make an effort to engage with someone
776.01	with whom you might typically
776.01	avoid a political conversation.
779.003	But remember, the goal isn't to win,
781.892	the goal is to listen and to understand
784.554	and to be open to learning something new.
787.587	LA: So let's go back to election night.
789.884	As the polls were closing
791.171	and it became clear that Trump
791.171	was going to be our new president,
794.504	I was devastated.
796.485	I was sad, I was confused,
799.14	and I'll be honest -- I was angry.
801.873	And then just before midnight,
803.58	I received this text message from Caitlin.
805.961	[I know this is a hard night for you guys.
809.357	We are thinking of you. Love you.]
812.485	And where there so easy could have been
812.485	weeks or months of awkwardness
816.319	and unspoken hostility, there was this --
820.002	an offering of empathy
820.002	rooted in friendship.
823.554	And I knew, in that moment,
823.554	that we would make it through this.
827.512	CQ: So we must find a way
827.512	to engage in meaningful conversations
831.152	that are going to move us
831.152	forward as a nation,
833.528	and we can no longer wait
834.973	for our elected officials
834.973	to elevate our national discourse.
838.889	LA: The challenges ahead
838.889	are going to require all of us
842.131	to participate in a deeper
842.131	and more meaningful way ...
