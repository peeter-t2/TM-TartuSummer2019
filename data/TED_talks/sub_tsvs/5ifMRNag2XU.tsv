12.99	Hi, kids.
14.539	(Laughter)
16.099	I'm 71.
18.683	(Applause)
20.778	My husband is 76.
23.58	My parents are in their late 90s,
27.04	and Olivia, the dog, is 16.
29.74	So let's talk about aging.
32.13	Let me tell you how I feel
33.548	when I see my wrinkles in the mirror
35.875	and I realize that some parts of me have dropped
39.2	and I can't find them down there.
41.832	(Laughter)
42.97	Mary Oliver says in one of her poems,
46.169	"""Tell me, what is it that you plan to do"
49.848	"with your one wild and precious life?"""
53.531	Me, I intend to live passionately.
57.834	When do we start aging?
59.846	Society decides when we are old,
62.233	usually around 65, when we get Medicare,
66.464	but we really start aging at birth.
69.23	We are aging right now,
71.19	and we all experience it differently.
74.383	We all feel younger than our real age,
77.825	because the spirit never ages.
79.996	I am still 17.
83.291	Sophia Loren. Look at her.
86.82	She says that everything you see
89.693	she owes to spaghetti.
91.976	I tried it and gained 10 pounds
94.464	in the wrong places.
96.566	But attitude, aging is also attitude and health.
101.718	But my real mentor in this journey of aging
105.418	is Olga Murray.
106.959	This California girl at 60
109.749	started working in Nepal to save young girls
113.45	from domestic bondage.
115.509	At 88, she has saved 12,000 girls,
119.9	and she has changed the culture in the country.
122.393	(Applause)
123.383	Now it is illegal for fathers
126.83	to sell their daughters into servitude.
129.986	She has also founded orphanages
132.513	and nutritional clinics.
134.543	She is always happy
136.196	and eternally young.
139.697	What have I lost in the last decades?
143.725	People, of course,
145.896	places, and the boundless energy of my youth,
149.743	and I'm beginning to lose independence,
151.588	and that scares me.
153.973	Ram Dass says that dependency hurts,
158.146	but if you accept it, there is less suffering.
161.039	After a very bad stroke,
163.175	his ageless soul watches the changes
166.527	in the body with tenderness,
168.788	and he is grateful to the people who help him.
173.3	What have I gained?
176.37	Freedom: I don't have to prove anything anymore.
180.431	I'm not stuck in the idea of who I was,
182.996	who I want to be,
184.126	or what other people expect me to be.
187.99	I don't have to please men anymore,
192.04	only animals.
194.888	I keep telling my superego to back off
198.43	and let me enjoy what I still have.
200.612	My body may be falling apart,
202.671	but my brain is not, yet.
206.125	I love my brain.
208.172	I feel lighter.
211.13	I don't carry grudges, ambition, vanity,
216.407	none of the deadly sins that are not even
218.262	worth the trouble.
220.456	It's great to let go.
222.2	I should have started sooner.
224.29	And I also feel softer
227.036	because I'm not scared of being vulnerable.
231.06	I don't see it as weakness anymore.
234.75	And I've gained spirituality.
237.274	I'm aware that before,
239.197	death was in the neighborhood.
241.493	Now, it's next door, or in my house.
246.794	I try to live mindfully
249.263	and be present in the moment.
251.389	By the way, the Dalai Lama
253.15	is someone who has aged beautifully,
255.27	but who wants to be vegetarian and celibate?
257.677	(Laughter)
264.676	Meditation helps.
267.206	(Video) Child: Ommm. Ommm. Ommm.
271.173	Isabel Allende: Ommm. Ommm. There it is.
273.11	And it's good to start early.
275.165	You know, for a vain female like myself,
278.836	it's very hard to age in this culture.
282.233	Inside, I feel good, I feel charming, seductive, sexy.
286.958	Nobody else sees that. (Laughter)
289.89	I'm invisible.
292.11	I want to be the center of attention.
293.754	I hate to be invisible.
296.812	(Laughter) (Applause)
298.893	This is Grace Dammann.
300.992	She has been in a wheelchair for six years
303.415	after a terrible car accident.
305.78	She says that there is nothing more sensual
309.637	than a hot shower,
311.137	that every drop of water
312.934	is a blessing to the senses.
316.144	She doesn't see herself as disabled.
318.512	In her mind, she's still surfing in the ocean.
322.518	Ethel Seiderman, a feisty, beloved activist
327.152	in the place where I live in California.
329.886	She wears red patent shoes,
333.778	and her mantra is that one scarf is nice
336.03	but two is better.
337.815	She has been a widow for nine years,
340.618	but she's not looking for another mate.
342.65	She says that there is only a limited number
345.735	of ways you can screw —
347.985	well, she says it in another way —
349.999	and she has tried them all.
351.967	(Laughter)
355.006	I, on the other hand,
356.291	I still have erotic fantasies with Antonio Banderas —
359.909	(Laughter) —
361.187	and my poor husband has to put up with it.
365.537	So how can I stay passionate?
367.795	I cannot will myself to be passionate at 71.
371.747	I have been training for some time,
373.986	and when I feel flat and bored, I fake it.
377.743	Attitude, attitude.
380.409	How do I train? I train by saying yes
383.143	to whatever comes my way:
384.954	drama, comedy, tragedy,
387.732	love, death, losses.
390.724	Yes to life.
392.806	And I train by trying to stay in love.
396.237	It doesn't always work,
397.69	but you cannot blame me for trying.
400.544	And, on a final note,
403.043	retirement in Spanish is jubilación.
407.03	Jubilation. Celebration.
409.777	We have paid our dues.
411.263	We have contributed to society.
413.34	Now it's our time, and it's a great time.
416.673	Unless you are ill or very poor,
419.71	you have choices.
421.231	I have chosen to stay passionate,
423.884	engaged with an open heart.
426.483	I am working on it every day.
429.25	Want to join me?
432.682	Thank you.
434.345	(Applause)
439.644	June Cohen: So Isabel —
439.644	IA: Thank you.
443.1	JC: First of all,
446.461	I never like to presume to
446.461	speak for the TED community,
449.21	but I would like to tell you that I have a feeling
451.388	we can all agree that you are still charming,
453.222	seductive and sexy. Yes?
455.191	IA: Aww, thank you.
455.191	(Applause)
457.686	JC: Hands down.
457.686	IA: No, it's makeup.
460.172	Moderator: Now, would it be awkward
461.612	if I asked you a follow-up question
461.612	about your erotic fantasies?
464.132	IA: Oh, of course. About what?
465.81	(Laughter)
466.811	Moderator: About your erotic fantasies.
466.811	IA: With Antonio Banderas.
469.847	Moderator: I was just wondering
469.847	if you have anything more to share.
472.626	IA: Well, one of them is that — (Laughter)
477.8	One of them is that I place a naked Antonio Banderas
479.929	on a Mexican tortilla,
482.862	I slather him with guacamole and salsa,
486.552	I roll him up, and I eat him. (Laughter)
490.051	Thank you.
491.844	(Applause)
