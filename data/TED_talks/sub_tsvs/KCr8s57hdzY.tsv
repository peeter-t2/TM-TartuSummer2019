12.853	"""Can you taste words?"""
15.8	It was a question
15.8	that caught me by surprise.
18.88	This summer, I was giving a talk
18.88	at a literary festival,
22.015	and afterwards, as I was signing books,
24.715	a teenage girl came with her friend,
27.418	and this is what she asked me.
29.475	I told her that some people
29.475	experience an overlap in their senses
34.316	so that they could hear colors
36.167	or see sounds,
37.719	and many writers were fascinated
37.719	by this subject, myself included.
43.181	But she cut me off, a bit impatiently,
43.181	"and said, ""Yeah, I know all of that."
48.074	It's called synesthesia.
48.074	We learned it at school.
51.386	But my mom is reading your book,
53.839	and she says there's lots
53.839	of food and ingredients
57.314	and a long dinner scene in it.
59.222	She gets hungry at every page.
61.412	So I was thinking,
62.982	how come you don't
62.982	get hungry when you write?
65.238	And I thought maybe,
65.238	maybe you could taste words.
68.83	"Does it make sense?"""
70.701	And, actually, it did make sense,
72.9	because ever since my childhood,
75.031	each letter in the alphabet
75.031	has a different color,
78.728	and colors bring me flavors.
81.281	So for instance, the color purple
81.281	is quite pungent, almost perfumed,
86.911	and any words that I associate with purple
90.752	taste the same way,
92.942	"such as ""sunset"" -- a very spicy word."
97.271	But I was worried that if I tell
97.271	all of this to the teenager,
101.993	it might sound either too abstract
104.167	or perhaps too weird,
106.955	and there wasn't enough time anyhow,
108.719	because people were waiting in the queue,
111.004	so it suddenly felt like
111.004	what I was trying to convey
115.56	was more complicated and detailed
118.633	than what the circumstances
118.633	allowed me to say.
123.392	And I did what I usually do
123.392	in similar situations:
127.643	I stammered, I shut down,
127.643	and I stopped talking.
131.272	I stopped talking because
131.272	the truth was complicated,
135.462	even though I knew, deep within,
137.913	that one should never, ever
137.913	remain silent for fear of complexity.
144.342	So I want to start my talk today
146.227	with the answer that I was not able
146.227	to give on that day.
149.772	Yes, I can taste words --
152.093	sometimes, that is, not always,
154.257	and happy words have
154.257	a different flavor than sad words.
158.305	I like to explore: What does
158.305	"the word ""creativity"" taste like,"
162.996	"or ""equality,"""
165.034	"""love,"" ""revolution?"""
167.504	"And what about ""motherland?"""
170.178	These days, it's particularly
170.178	this last word that troubles me.
174.446	It leaves a sweet taste on my tongue,
177.039	like cinnamon, a bit of rose water
180.449	and golden apples.
181.873	But underneath, there's a sharp tang,
185.095	like nettles and dandelion.
187.719	The taste of my motherland, Turkey,
191.03	is a mixture of sweet and bitter.
195.55	And the reason why I'm telling you this
197.516	is because I think
197.516	there's more and more people
199.963	all around the world today
201.779	who have similarly mixed emotions
204.668	about the lands they come from.
206.964	We love our native countries, yeah?
209.649	How can we not?
210.873	We feel attached to the people,
210.873	the culture, the land, the food.
215.338	And yet at the same time,
216.554	we feel increasingly frustrated
216.554	by its politics and politicians,
222.26	sometimes to the point
222.26	of despair or hurt or anger.
227.908	I want to talk about emotions
230.06	and the need to boost
230.06	our emotional intelligence.
233.817	I think it's a pity
234.992	that mainstream political theory
234.992	pays very little attention to emotions.
241.019	Oftentimes, analysts and experts
241.019	are so busy with data and metrics
246.637	that they seem to forget
246.637	those things in life
249.598	that are difficult to measure
251.456	and perhaps impossible to cluster
251.456	under statistical models.
256.745	But I think this is a mistake,
256.745	for two main reasons.
260.134	Firstly, because we are emotional beings.
263	As human beings,
263	I think we all are like that.
266.547	But secondly, and this is new,
269.245	we have entered
269.245	a new stage in world history
272.924	in which collective sentiments
272.924	guide and misguide politics
278.967	more than ever before.
281.771	And through social media
281.771	and social networking,
284.915	these sentiments are further amplified,
287.825	polarized, and they travel
287.825	around the world quite fast.
292.135	Ours is the age of anxiety, anger,
296.074	distrust, resentment
298.612	and, I think, lots of fear.
300.932	But here's the thing:
302.251	even though there's plenty of research
302.251	about economic factors,
307.05	there's relatively few studies
307.05	about emotional factors.
312.015	Why is it that we underestimate
312.015	feelings and perceptions?
317.183	I think it's going to be one
317.183	of our biggest intellectual challenges,
321.197	because our political systems
321.197	are replete with emotions.
326.521	In country after country,
328.351	we have seen illiberal politicians
328.351	exploiting these emotions.
333.787	And yet within the academia
333.787	and among the intelligentsia,
337.429	we are yet to take emotions seriously.
341.019	I think we should.
342.317	And just like we should focus
342.317	on economic inequality worldwide,
346.206	we need to pay more attention
346.206	to emotional and cognitive gaps worldwide
352.846	and how to bridge these gaps,
354.68	because they do matter.
357.554	Years ago, when I was still
357.554	living in Istanbul,
360.328	an American scholar working on
360.328	women writers in the Middle East
364.388	came to see me.
366.324	And at some point
366.324	in our exchange, she said,
368.873	"""I understand why you're a feminist,"
370.853	"because, you know, you live in Turkey."""
374.349	And I said to her,
375.531	"""I don't understand"
375.531	why you're not a feminist,
377.803	"because, you know, you live in America."""
380.079	(Laughter)
382.623	(Applause)
385.609	And she laughed.
388.11	She took it as a joke,
389.718	and the moment passed.
391.561	(Laughter)
393.482	But the way she had divided the world
393.482	into two imaginary camps,
398.416	into two opposite camps --
400.383	it bothered me and it stayed with me.
403.047	According to this imaginary map,
405.567	some parts of the world
405.567	were liquid countries.
409.113	They were like choppy waters
409.113	not yet settled.
412.407	Some other parts of the world,
412.407	namely the West,
415.742	were solid, safe and stable.
419.071	So it was the liquid lands
419.071	that needed feminism
422.409	and activism and human rights,
424.83	and those of us who were
424.83	unfortunate enough
427.252	to come from such places
429.088	had to keep struggling
429.088	for these most essential values.
433.886	But there was hope.
435.097	Since history moved forward,
436.928	even the most unsteady lands
436.928	would someday catch up.
441.341	And meanwhile, the citizens of solid lands
444.363	could take comfort
444.363	in the progress of history
448.559	and in the triumph of the liberal order.
451.833	They could support the struggles
451.833	of other people elsewhere,
455.82	but they themselves
455.82	did not have to struggle
459.37	for the basics of democracy anymore,
462.722	because they were beyond that stage.
466.524	I think in the year 2016,
468.993	this hierarchical geography
468.993	was shattered to pieces.
474.144	Our world no longer follows
474.144	this dualistic pattern
478.258	in the scholar's mind, if it ever did.
481.876	Now we know that history
481.876	does not necessarily move forward.
486.259	Sometimes it draws circles,
488.206	even slides backwards,
490.187	and that generations
490.187	can make the same mistakes
493.158	that their great-grandfathers had made.
496.016	And now we know that there's no such thing
498.647	as solid countries
498.647	versus liquid countries.
502.478	In fact, we are all living
502.478	in liquid times,
506.946	just like the late Zygmunt Bauman told us.
510.617	And Bauman had another
510.617	definition for our age.
513.833	He used to say we are all going
513.833	to be walking on moving sands.
520.052	And if that's the case, I think,
522.31	it should concern us women more than men,
525.635	because when societies
525.635	slide backwards into authoritarianism,
529.749	nationalism or religious fanaticism,
532.569	women have much more to lose.
535.46	That is why this needs
535.46	to be a vital moment,
538.305	not only for global activism,
540.52	but in my opinion,
540.52	for global sisterhood as well.
544.403	(Applause)
552.555	But I want to make a little confession
552.555	before I go any further.
555.927	Until recently, whenever I took part in
555.927	an international conference or festival,
561.132	I would be usually one
561.132	of the more depressed speakers.
565.347	(Laughter)
566.629	Having seen how our dreams of democracy
566.629	and how our dreams of coexistence
572.477	were crushed in Turkey,
574.464	both gradually but also
574.464	with a bewildering speed,
578.717	over the years I've felt
578.717	quite demoralized.
581.731	And at these festivals there would be
581.731	some other gloomy writers,
585.868	and they would come from places
585.868	such as Egypt, Nigeria, Pakistan,
590.811	Bangladesh, Philippines,
590.811	China, Venezuela, Russia.
595.856	And we would smile
595.856	at each other in sympathy,
598.233	this camaraderie of the doomed.
600.354	(Laughter)
602.985	And you could call us WADWIC:
605.213	Worried and Depressed
605.213	Writers International Club.
609.355	(Laughter)
611.101	But then things began to change,
612.896	and suddenly our club became more popular,
616.883	and we started to have new members.
619.416	I remember --
620.889	(Laughter)
623.375	I remember Greek writers and poets
623.375	joined first, came on board.
628.645	And then writers from Hungary and Poland,
632.426	and then, interestingly, writers
632.426	from Austria, the Netherlands, France,
637.922	and then writers from the UK,
637.922	where I live and where I call my home,
642.381	and then writers from the USA.
646.487	Suddenly, there were more of us
648.554	feeling worried about
648.554	the fate of our nations
651.361	and the future of the world.
653.647	And maybe there were more of us now
656.177	feeling like strangers
656.177	in our own motherlands.
660.444	And then this bizarre thing happened.
662.645	Those of us who used to be
662.645	very depressed for a long time,
666.156	we started to feel less depressed,
668.902	whereas the newcomers,
668.902	they were so not used to feeling this way
672.628	that they were now even more depressed.
674.704	(Laughter)
675.823	So you could see writers
675.823	from Bangladesh or Turkey or Egypt
680.685	trying to console their colleagues
684.139	from Brexit Britain
684.139	or from post-election USA.
688.622	(Laughter)
691.05	But joking aside,
692.321	I think our world is full
692.321	of unprecedented challenges,
696.742	and this comes with an emotional backlash,
699.804	because in the face of high-speed change,
702.049	many people wish to slow down,
704.14	and when there's too much unfamiliarity,
706.732	people long for the familiar.
709.193	And when things get too confusing,
711.463	many people crave simplicity.
714.527	This is a very dangerous crossroads,
716.988	because it's exactly where the demagogue
716.988	enters into the picture.
723.267	The demagogue understands
723.267	how collective sentiments work
727.158	and how he -- it's usually a he --
727.158	can benefit from them.
731.819	He tells us that we all
731.819	belong in our tribes,
735.433	and he tells us that we will be safer
735.433	if we are surrounded by sameness.
741.165	Demagogues come in all sizes
741.165	and in all shapes.
743.949	This could be the eccentric leader
743.949	of a marginal political party
748.284	somewhere in Europe,
749.644	or an Islamist extremist imam
749.644	preaching dogma and hatred,
755.39	or it could be a white supremacist
755.39	Nazi-admiring orator somewhere else.
761.114	All these figures, at first glance --
761.114	they seem disconnected.
765.29	But I think they feed each other,
767.714	and they need each other.
770.507	And all around the world,
771.747	when we look at how demagogues talk
771.747	and how they inspire movements,
777.536	I think they have one
777.536	unmistakable quality in common:
781.89	they strongly, strongly dislike plurality.
786.4	They cannot deal with multiplicity.
789.668	Adorno used to say,
791.29	"""Intolerance of ambiguity is the sign"
791.29	"of an authoritarian personality."""
798.529	But I ask myself:
799.891	What if that same sign,
801.878	that same intolerance of ambiguity --
805.055	what if it's the mark of our times,
805.055	of the age we're living in?
810.451	Because wherever I look,
810.451	I see nuances withering away.
814.339	On TV shows, we have
814.339	one anti-something speaker
818.397	situated against a pro-something speaker.
821.641	Yeah? It's good ratings.
823.149	It's even better
823.149	if they shout at each other.
825.921	Even in academia, where our intellect
825.921	is supposed to be nourished,
830.496	you see one atheist scholar
830.496	competing with a firmly theist scholar,
836.795	but it's not a real intellectual exchange,
839.783	because it's a clash
839.783	between two certainties.
844.003	I think binary oppositions are everywhere.
848.539	So slowly and systematically,
851.084	we are being denied the right
851.084	to be complex.
856.305	Istanbul, Berlin, Nice, Paris, Brussels,
859.932	Dhaka, Baghdad, Barcelona:
862.602	we have seen one horrible
862.602	terror attack after another.
866.505	And when you express your sorrow,
866.505	and when you react against the cruelty,
870.921	you get all kinds of reactions,
872.787	messages on social media.
874.866	But one of them is quite disturbing,
876.726	only because it's so widespread.
878.948	"They say, ""Why do you feel sorry for them?"
883.392	Why do you feel sorry for them?
885.596	Why don't you feel sorry
885.596	for civilians in Yemen
888.562	"or civilians in Syria?"""
891.793	And I think the people
891.793	who write such messages
894.217	do not understand
895.697	that we can feel sorry for
895.697	and stand in solidarity with
900.768	victims of terrorism and violence
900.768	in the Middle East, in Europe,
905.413	in Asia, in America, wherever, everywhere,
908.373	equally and simultaneously.
911.004	They don't seem to understand
911.004	that we don't have to pick one pain
914.762	and one place over all others.
918.86	But I think this is what
918.86	tribalism does to us.
922.467	It shrinks our minds, for sure,
924.8	but it also shrinks our hearts,
926.946	to such an extent that we become numb
926.946	to the suffering of other people.
933.52	And the sad truth is,
933.52	we weren't always like this.
936.508	I had a children's book out in Turkey,
940.544	and when the book was published,
940.544	I did lots of events.
943.543	I went to many primary schools,
945.177	which gave me a chance to observe
945.177	younger kids in Turkey.
949.093	And it was always amazing to see
949.093	how much empathy, imagination
953.959	and chutzpah they have.
955.423	These children are much more inclined
955.423	to become global citizens
959.474	than nationalists at that age.
962.004	And it's wonderful to see,
962.004	when you ask them,
964.125	so many of them want
964.125	to be poets and writers,
967.24	and girls are just as confident as boys,
970.662	if not even more.
972.626	But then I would go to high schools,
974.829	and everything has changed.
976.668	Now nobody wants to be a writer anymore,
978.858	now nobody wants to be a novelist anymore,
981.318	and girls have become timid,
984.096	they are cautious, guarded,
986.254	reluctant to speak up in the public space,
989.518	because we have taught them --
991.218	the family, the school, the society --
993.691	we have taught them
993.691	to erase their individuality.
997.866	I think East and West,
999.211	we are losing multiplicity,
1001.791	both within our societies
1001.791	and within ourselves.
1006.352	And coming from Turkey,
1006.352	I do know that the loss of diversity
1010.587	is a major, major loss.
1013.098	Today, my motherland became
1013.098	the world's biggest jailer
1016.449	for journalists,
1017.813	surpassing even China's sad record.
1022.11	And I also believe that what happened
1022.11	over there in Turkey
1027.528	can happen anywhere.
1029.005	It can even happen here.
1031.467	So just like solid countries
1031.467	was an illusion,
1035.717	singular identities is also an illusion,
1040.052	because we all have
1040.052	a multiplicity of voices inside.
1045.865	The Iranian, the Persian poet, Hafiz,
1049.23	"used to say, ""You carry in your soul"
1049.23	every ingredient necessary
1054.638	to turn your existence into joy.
1057.543	All you have to do
1057.543	"is to mix those ingredients."""
1061.309	And I think mix we can.
1063.31	I am an Istanbulite,
1066.446	but I'm also attached to the Balkans,
1068.633	the Aegean, the Mediterranean,
1071.057	the Middle East, the Levant.
1073.381	I am a European by birth, by choice,
1076.176	the values that I uphold.
1078.44	I have become a Londoner over the years.
1081.037	I would like to think of myself
1081.037	as a global soul, as a world citizen,
1085.801	a nomad and an itinerant storyteller.
1089.82	I have multiple attachments,
1089.82	just like all of us do.
1093.601	And multiple attachments
1093.601	mean multiple stories.
1098.448	As writers, we always
1098.448	chase stories, of course,
1103.181	but I think we are also
1103.181	interested in silences,
1106.299	the things we cannot talk about,
1108.382	political taboos, cultural taboos.
1111.379	We're also interested in our own silences.
1115.38	I have always been very vocal
1115.38	about and written extensively
1119.495	about minority rights, women's rights,
1122.564	LGBT rights.
1124.62	But as I was thinking about this TED Talk,
1127.713	I realized one thing:
1129.3	I have never had the courage
1129.3	to say in a public space
1134.234	that I was bisexual myself,
1137.461	because I so feared the slander
1140.612	and the stigma and the ridicule
1143.144	and the hatred that was sure to follow.
1146.62	But of course, one should never,
1146.62	ever, remain silent
1151.186	for fear of complexity.
1154.482	(Applause)
1162.323	And although I am
1162.323	no stranger to anxieties,
1165.65	and although I am talking here
1165.65	about the power of emotions --
1169.42	I do know the power of emotions --
1171.496	I have discovered over time
1173.447	that emotions are not limitless.
1175.621	You know? They have a limit.
1177.399	There comes a moment --
1178.698	it's like a tipping point
1178.698	or a threshold --
1180.845	when you get tired of feeling afraid,
1183.992	when you get tired of feeling anxious.
1186.688	And I think not only individuals,
1188.607	but perhaps nations, too,
1188.607	have their own tipping points.
1193.685	So even stronger than my emotions
1196.437	is my awareness
1198.362	that not only gender, not only identity,
1202.035	but life itself is fluid.
1205.471	They want to divide us into tribes,
1208.209	but we are connected across borders.
1211.211	They preach certainty,
1212.913	but we know that life has plenty of magic
1216.538	and plenty of ambiguity.
1218.608	And they like to incite dualities,
1221.423	but we are far more nuanced than that.
1225.38	So what can we do?
1226.923	I think we need to go back to the basics,
1229.265	back to the colors of the alphabet.
1232.037	The Lebanese poet
1232.037	Khalil Gibran used to say,
1235.821	"""I learned silence from the talkative"
1238.638	and tolerance from the intolerant
1241.102	"and kindness from the unkind."""
1243.972	I think it's a great motto for our times.
1247.094	So from populist demagogues, we will learn
1250.579	the indispensability of democracy.
1253.319	And from isolationists, we will learn
1253.319	the need for global solidarity.
1258.077	And from tribalists, we will learn
1258.077	the beauty of cosmopolitanism
1263.582	and the beauty of diversity.
1267.223	As I finish, I want to leave you
1267.223	with one word, or one taste.
1272.481	"The word ""yurt"" in Turkish"
1272.481	"means ""motherland."""
1276.19	"It means ""homeland."""
1277.885	But interestingly, the word also means
1280.188	"""a tent used by nomadic tribes."""
1283.966	And I like that combination,
1283.966	because it makes me think
1287.048	homelands do not need
1287.048	to be rooted in one place.
1291.148	They can be portable.
1292.636	We can take them with us everywhere.
1295.369	And I think for writers, for storytellers,
1298.316	at the end of the day,
1299.752	there is one main homeland,
1302.201	"and it's called ""Storyland."""
1304.963	And the taste of that word
1307.287	is the taste of freedom.
1309.615	Thank you.
1310.942	(Applause)
