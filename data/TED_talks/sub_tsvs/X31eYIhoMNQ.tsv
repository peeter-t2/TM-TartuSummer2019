15.625	What I want to talk to you about today
17.656	is some of the problems that the military
17.656	of the Western world --
22.26	Australia, United States,
22.26	the UK and so on --
25.021	face in some of the deployments
25.021	that they're dealing with
28.175	in the modern world at this time.
30.103	If you think about the sorts of things
31.951	we've sent Australian military
31.951	personnel to in recent years,
35.072	we've got obvious things
35.072	like Iraq and Afghanistan,
37.489	but you've also got things like
37.489	East Timor and the Solomon Islands,
40.681	and so on.
41.858	And a lot of these deployments
43.318	that we're sending
43.318	military personnel to these days
46.476	aren't traditional wars.
48.613	In fact, a lot of the jobs
48.613	we're asking military personnel to do
52.724	in those situations
53.899	are ones that, in their own countries --
53.899	Australia, the US and so on --
57.499	would actually be done by police officers.
59.892	So there's a bunch
59.892	of problems that come up
61.944	for military personnel
61.944	in these situations,
63.976	because they're doing things
63.976	they haven't really been trained for.
67.251	And they're doing things that those
67.251	who do them in their own countries
72.087	are trained very differently for
72.087	and equipped very differently for.
75.766	Now, there's a bunch of reasons
75.766	why we send military personnel,
79.453	rather than police, to do these jobs.
81.675	If Australia had to send
81.675	1,000 people tomorrow
84.26	to West Papua, for example,
87.059	we don't have 1,000 police officers
87.059	hanging around that could go tomorrow,
90.91	and we do have
90.91	1,000 soldiers that could go.
93.511	So when we have to send someone,
93.511	we send the military --
96.195	they're there, they're available,
97.796	and heck, they're used to going off
97.796	and doing these things
100.553	and living by themselves
101.82	and not having all this extra support.
103.682	So they are able to do it in that sense.
106.366	But they aren't trained
106.366	the same way police officers are,
109.22	and they're certainly not equipped
109.22	the way police officers are,
112.24	so this has raised
112.24	a bunch of problems for them
114.456	when dealing with these issues.
115.966	One particular thing that's come up
115.966	that I am especially interested in,
119.348	is the question of whether,
120.999	when we're sending military personnel
120.999	to do these sorts of jobs,
124.063	we ought to be equipping them differently;
126.117	and in particular, whether we ought
126.117	to be giving them access
129.006	to some of the nonlethal weapons
129.006	that police have.
131.446	Since they're doing some of the same jobs,
133.549	maybe they should have
133.549	some of those things.
135.631	And there's a range of places you'd think
135.631	those things would be really useful.
139.354	For example, when you've got
139.354	military checkpoints.
141.961	If people are approaching
141.961	these checkpoints
144	and the military personnel are unsure
144	if this person's hostile or not,
147.649	say this person approaching
147.649	here, and they say,
150.027	"""Is this a suicide bomber or not?"
151.647	Is something hidden under their clothes?
153.637	"What's going to happen?"""
154.815	They don't know if the person
154.815	is hostile or not.
157.091	If the person doesn't follow directions,
157.091	they may end up shooting them,
160.502	and then find out afterwards
160.502	either, yes, we shot the right person,
163.741	or, no, this was just an innocent person
165.71	who didn't understand what was going on.
167.866	So if they had nonlethal weapons,
167.866	then they would say,
170.496	"""We can use them"
170.496	in that sort of situation.
172.547	If we shoot someone who wasn't hostile,
174.459	"at least we haven't killed them."""
176.332	Another situation: this photo
176.332	is from one of the missions
179.611	in the Balkans in the late 1990s.
182.025	This situation is a little bit different,
184.026	where maybe they know someone is hostile;
186.011	they've got someone shooting at them
187.753	or doing something else
187.753	that's clearly hostile,
189.974	throwing rocks, whatever.
191.23	But if they respond,
192.405	there's a range of other people around
192.405	who are innocent people,
195.422	who might also get hurt.
196.601	It'd be collateral damage
197.852	that the military
197.852	often doesn't want to talk about.
200.593	"So again, they'd say, ""With access"
200.593	to nonlethal weapons,
203.376	if we've got someone we know is hostile,
205.333	we can do something to deal with them,
207.19	and know that if we hit anyone else,
208.976	"at least we're not going to kill them."""
211.351	Another suggestion has been,
212.811	since we're putting so many
212.811	robots in the field,
215.122	we can see the time coming
216.416	where they're actually going
216.416	to send robots out in the field
219.308	that are autonomous.
220.486	They'll make their own decisions
220.486	about who to shoot and who not to shoot,
223.989	without a human in the loop.
225.355	So the suggestion is,
226.691	if we're going to send robots out
226.691	and allow them to do this,
229.829	maybe it would be a good idea
229.829	if they were armed with nonlethal weapons,
234.111	so if the robot makes a bad decision
234.111	and shoots the wrong person,
237.248	again, they haven't actually killed them.
239.892	Now, there's a whole range
239.892	of different sorts of nonlethal weapons,
243.132	some of which are available now,
244.757	some of which they're developing.
246.373	You've got traditional things
246.373	like pepper spray,
248.675	OC spray up at the top there,
250.18	or Tasers over here.
252.058	The one on the top right here
252.058	is actually a dazzling laser,
255.234	intended to just blind
255.234	the person momentarily
257.873	and disorient them.
259.507	You've got nonlethal shotgun rounds
261.523	that contain rubber pellets
261.523	instead of the traditional metal ones.
264.966	And this one in the middle
264.966	here, the large truck,
267.573	is called the Active Denial System,
269.967	something the US military
269.967	is working on at the moment.
272.611	It's essentially a big
272.611	microwave transmitter.
276.054	It's sort of your classic
276.054	idea of a heat ray.
279.207	It goes out to a really long distance,
281.86	compared to any of these
281.86	other sorts of things.
284.123	Anybody who is hit with this
284.123	feels a sudden burst of heat,
287.973	and just wants to get out of the way.
290.108	It is a lot more sophisticated
290.108	than a microwave oven,
292.756	but it basically is boiling
292.756	the water molecules
295.662	in the very surface level of your skin.
297.638	So you feel this massive heat,
299.408	"and you go, ""I want"
299.408	"to get out of the way."""
301.844	And they think this will be really useful
303.848	in places where we need to clear
303.848	a crowd out of a particular area,
307.017	if the crowd is being hostile.
308.49	If we need to keep people
308.49	away from a particular place,
311.125	we can do that with these sorts of things.
313.62	So there's a whole range
313.62	of different nonlethal weapons
316.681	we could give military personnel,
318.645	and there's a whole range of situations
320.576	where they're looking at them and saying,
322.553	"""These things would be really useful."""
324.412	But as I said,
325.84	the military and the police
325.84	are very different.
328.853	(Laughter)
329.909	Yes, you don't have to look
329.909	very hard at this to recognize
332.664	that they might be very different.
334.456	In particular,
335.75	the attitude to the use of force
337.454	and the way they're trained to use force
339.546	is especially different.
342.236	The police --
343.86	and knowing because I've actually
343.86	helped to train police --
346.896	police, particularly
346.896	in Western jurisdictions at least,
349.658	are trained to De-escalate force,
353.525	to try and avoid using force
353.525	wherever possible,
356.494	and to use lethal force
356.494	only as an absolute last resort.
361.701	Military personnel
361.701	are being trained for war.
364.86	So they're trained that,
364.86	as soon as things go bad,
367.971	their first response is lethal force.
371.66	The moment the fecal matter
371.66	hits the rotating turbine --
374.752	(Laughter)
375.808	you can start shooting at people.
379.013	So their attitudes
380.86	to the use of lethal force
380.86	are very different,
383.277	and I think it's fairly obvious
384.92	that their attitude to the use
384.92	of nonlethal weapons
387.86	would also be very different
387.86	from what it is with the police.
391.437	And since we've already had
391.437	so many problems
393.562	with police use of nonlethal
393.562	weapons in various ways,
396.207	I thought it would be a good idea
396.207	to look at some of those things
399.309	and relate it to the military context.
401.154	I was very surprised when I started
401.154	to do this to see that, in fact,
404.86	even the people who advocated the use
404.86	of nonlethal weapons by the military
408.515	hadn't actually done that.
409.86	They generally seemed to think,
411.413	"""Why would we care"
411.413	what's happened with the police?
413.989	"We're looking at something different,"""
415.835	and didn't seem to recognize
417.271	they were looking at pretty
417.271	much the same stuff.
419.742	So I started to investigate
419.742	some of those issues,
422.55	and have a look at the way
422.55	police use nonlethal weapons
426.327	when they're introduced,
427.509	and some of the problems that might
427.509	arise out of those sorts of things
430.86	when they actually do introduce them.
432.911	And of course, being Australian,
435.494	I started looking at stuff in Australia,
435.494	knowing from my own experience
439.286	of various times when nonlethal weapons
439.286	have been introduced in Australia.
443.126	One of the things I particularly
443.126	looked at was the use of OC spray --
446.616	oleoresin capsicum spray, pepper spray --
449.153	by Australian police,
451.109	and seeing what had happened
451.109	when that had been introduced,
453.944	and those sorts of issues.
455.447	And one study that I found,
455.447	a particularly interesting one,
458.577	was in Queensland,
460.498	because they had a trial period
460.498	for the use of pepper spray
463.947	before they actually
463.947	introduced it more broadly.
466.992	And I went and had a look
466.992	at some of the figures here.
469.865	Now, when they introduced
469.865	OC spray in Queensland,
472.396	they were really explicit.
473.992	The police minister's and a heap
473.992	of public statements were made about it.
477.512	"They were saying, ""This is explicitly"
477.512	intended to give police an option
480.929	between shouting and shooting.
484.118	This is something they can use
484.118	instead of a firearm
486.86	in situations where they would have
486.86	"previously had to shoot someone."""
490.153	So I looked at all
490.153	of the police shooting figures.
492.86	And you can't actually
492.86	find them very easily
494.98	for individual Australian states;
496.86	I could only find these.
498.4	This is from an Australian Institute
498.4	of Criminology report.
501.223	You can see, in the fine print at the top:
503.255	"""Police shooting deaths"""
503.255	means not just people shot by police,
506.504	but people who have shot themselves
506.504	in the presence of police.
509.558	But these are the figures
509.558	across the entire country,
512.033	and the red arrow represents
512.033	the point where Queensland said,
515.161	"""Yes, this is where we're going to give"
517.079	all police officers
517.079	across the entire state
519.243	"access to OC spray."""
520.77	So you can see there were six deaths
520.77	sort of leading up to it,
523.86	every year for a number of years.
525.955	There was a spike a few years before,
527.86	but that wasn't actually Queensland.
529.726	Anyone know where that was?
531.381	Wasn't Port Arthur, no.
533.026	Victoria? Yes, correct.
535.128	That spike was all Victoria.
537.129	(Laughter)
538.304	So it wasn't that Queensland
538.304	had a particular problem
540.892	with deaths from police
540.892	shootings and so on.
543.611	So, six shootings
543.611	across the whole country,
546.048	fairly consistently over the years before.
548.109	The next two years were the years
548.109	they studied -- 2001, 2002.
551.085	Anyone want to take a stab
551.085	at the number of times,
554.021	given how they've introduced this,
555.701	the number of times police in Queensland
555.701	used OC spray in that period?
559.193	Hundreds? One? Three?
561.685	A thousand is getting better.
565.731	Explicitly introduced as an alternative
565.731	to the use of lethal force --
569.741	an alternative between
569.741	shouting and shooting.
572.479	I'm going to go out on a limb here
574.48	and say that if Queensland police
574.48	didn't have OC spray,
577.792	they wouldn't have shot 2,226 people
580.597	in those two years.
581.992	(Laughter)
584.482	In fact, if you have a look
584.482	at the studies they were looking at,
587.705	the material they were
587.705	collecting and examining,
591.011	you can see the suspects were only armed
591.011	in about 15 percent of cases
595.647	where OC spray was used.
598.079	It was routinely being
598.079	used in this period,
600.741	and, of course, still is routinely used --
602.884	because there were no complaints about it,
605.29	not within the context
605.29	of this study, anyway --
608.412	it was routinely being used
608.412	to deal with people who were violent,
612.248	who were potentially violent,
613.975	and also quite frequently used
616.316	to deal with people who were
616.316	simply passively noncompliant.
621.482	This person is not doing anything violent,
623.591	but they just won't do
623.591	what we want them to.
625.7	They're not obeying
625.7	the directions we're giving them,
628.237	so we'll give them a shot
628.237	of the OC spray -- that'll speed them up.
631.413	Everything will work out better that way.
633.964	This was something explicitly introduced
636.392	to be an alternative to firearms,
638.248	but it's being routinely used
640.249	to deal with a whole range
640.249	of other sorts of problems.
643.726	Now one of the particular
643.726	issues that comes up
646.074	with military use of nonlethal weapons --
648.86	and people actually say,
648.86	"""There might be some problems"" --"
651.803	there's a couple of particular
651.803	problems that get focused on.
655.221	One of those problems is: nonlethal
655.221	weapons may be used indiscriminately.
660.396	One of the fundamental principles
660.396	of military use of force
663.641	is that you have to be discriminate;
665.433	you have to be careful
665.433	about who you're shooting at.
668.21	So one of the problems suggested
668.21	with nonlethal weapons
670.86	is that they might be used
670.86	indiscriminately --
673.075	that you would use them
673.075	against a whole range of people,
675.735	because you don't have
675.735	to worry so much anymore.
678.064	And in fact, one particular instance
678.064	where I think that actually happens
681.699	was the Dubrovka Theater
681.699	siege in Moscow in 2002,
684.581	which probably a lot of you,
684.581	unlike most of my students at ADFA,
687.62	are old enough to remember.
689.237	So, Chechens had come in
689.237	and taken control of the theater.
692.022	They were holding something
692.022	like 700 people hostage.
695.354	They'd released a bunch of people,
697.008	but they still had
697.008	about 700 people hostage.
699.398	And the Russian military police
699.398	"special forces, ""Spetsnaz,"""
704.86	came in and stormed the theater.
706.86	The way they did it was to pump
706.86	the whole thing full of anesthetic gas.
710.327	And it turned out
710.327	that lots of the hostages died
714.953	as a result of inhaling the gas.
717.741	It was used indiscriminately.
719.86	They pumped the whole theater
719.86	full of the gas.
722.749	And it's no surprise that people died,
725.463	because you don't know how much gas
725.463	each person is going to inhale,
728.86	what position they'll fall in when
728.86	they become unconscious, and so on.
732.779	There were, in fact,
732.779	only a couple of people who got shot
735.86	in this episode.
737.86	So when they had a look at it afterward,
739.86	there were only a couple of people
739.86	who'd apparently been shot,
742.826	by the hostage takers
742.826	or by the police forces
745.726	trying to deal with the situation.
747.756	Virtually everybody that got killed
749.487	got killed from inhaling the gas.
752.383	The final toll of hostages
752.383	is a little unclear,
755.735	but it's certainly a few more than that,
757.687	because other people died
757.687	over the next few days.
760	So this was one problem they talked about,
762.071	that it might be used indiscriminately.
763.959	A second problem
763.959	people sometimes talk about
766.228	with military use of nonlethal weapons --
768.22	and it's actually why,
768.22	in the chemical weapons convention,
771.123	it's very clear that you can't use
771.123	riot-control agents
773.72	as weapons of warfare --
775.033	is that it's seen that sometimes
775.033	nonlethal weapons might be used
779.086	not as an alternative to lethal force,
781.031	but as a lethal force multiplier:
783.974	that you use nonlethal weapons first,
785.939	so your lethal weapons
785.939	will actually be more effective.
789.417	The people you'll be shooting at
789.417	won't be able to get out of the way.
792.797	They won't be aware of what's happening,
792.797	and you can kill them better.
796.214	And that's exactly what happened here.
798.951	The hostage takers who had
798.951	been rendered unconscious by the gas
802.031	were not taken into custody;
803.473	they were simply shot in the head.
806.791	So this nonlethal weapon
806.791	was being used in this case
810.86	as a lethal force multiplier,
813.86	to make killing more effective
813.86	in this particular situation.
818.7	Another problem I want to quickly mention
821.105	is that there's a whole heap of problems
823.359	with the way people are actually
823.359	taught to use nonlethal weapons,
826.86	and get trained about them
826.86	and then tested and so on.
829.417	Because they're tested
829.417	in nice, safe environments,
832.316	and are taught to use them
832.316	in nice, safe environments --
834.977	like this, where you can see
834.977	exactly what's going on.
838.286	The person spraying the OC spray
838.286	is wearing a rubber glove
841.085	to make sure they don't get
841.085	contaminated, and so on.
843.551	But they're never used like that.
845.186	They're used out in the real world,
847.378	like in Texas, like this:
849.736	"[""Police Taser Great-Grandmother"
849.736	"During Traffic Stop""]"
852.35	I confess, this particular case
852.35	was one that piqued my interest in this.
855.86	It happened while I was working
855.86	as a research fellow
858.332	at the US Naval Academy.
859.544	News reports started
859.544	coming up about this situation,
862.545	where this woman was arguing
862.545	with a police officer.
864.969	She wasn't violent.
866.376	In fact, he was probably
866.376	six inches taller than me,
869.313	and she was about this tall.
871.632	And eventually she said to him,
873.363	"""Well, I'm going to get back in my car."""
875.488	"And he says, ""If you get back"
875.488	"in your car, I'm going to tase you."""
878.654	"And she says, ""Oh, go ahead."
878.654	"Tase me."" And so he does."
881.798	And it's all captured by the video camera
883.837	running in the front of the police car.
887.436	So, she's 72.
890.332	And it's seen that this is the most
890.332	appropriate way of dealing with her.
893.81	And there are other examples
893.81	of the same sorts of things,
896.959	where you think,
898.149	"""Is this really an appropriate way"
898.149	"to use nonlethal weapons?"""
901.503	"""Police Chief Fires Taser"
901.503	"into 14 year old Girl's Head."""
904.159	"""She was running away."
904.159	"What else was I suppose to do?"""
906.747	(Laughter)
908.993	Or Florida:
910.953	"""Police Taser 6-year-old"
910.953	"Boy at Elementary School."""
913.787	And they clearly learned a lot from it,
913.787	because in the same district:
917.548	"""Police Review Policy"
917.548	After Children Shocked:
920.213	2nd Child Shocked by Taser
920.213	"Stun Gun Within Weeks."""
922.944	Same police district.
924.928	Another child within weeks
924.928	of Tasering the six-year-old boy.
928.137	Just in case you think it's only going
928.137	to happen in the United States,
931.646	it happened in Canada as well:
933.488	"[""Mounties Zap 11-year-old Boy""]"
935.058	And a colleague sent me
935.058	this one from London:
937.192	"[""Arrested Man, 82, Shot with Taser""]"
939.086	But my personal favorite,
939.086	I have to confess, does come from the US:
943.521	"""Officers Taser 86-year-old"
943.521	"Disabled Woman in her Bed."""
946.837	(Laughter)
949.067	I checked the reports on this one.
951.195	I looked at it. I was really surprised.
953.293	Apparently, she took up a more
953.293	threatening position in her bed.
957.485	(Laughter)
959.199	I kid you not,
959.199	that's exactly what it said:
961.272	"""She took up a more threatening"
961.272	"position in her bed."""
964.626	OK.
965.966	But I'd remind you --
967.435	I'm talking about military
967.435	uses of nonlethal weapons,
969.975	so why is this relevant?
971.157	Because police are actually
971.157	more restrained in the use of force
974.403	than the military are.
975.894	They're trained to be more
975.894	restrained in the use of force
978.604	than the military are.
979.798	They're trained to think more,
979.798	to try and De-escalate.
982.364	So if you have these problems
982.364	with police officers
984.735	with nonlethal weapons,
985.925	what on earth would make you think
987.592	it's going to be better
987.592	with military personnel?
990.734	The last thing that I would like to say:
994.032	When I'm talking to the police
995.493	about what a perfect nonlethal
995.493	weapon would look like,
998.057	they almost inevitably say the same thing.
1000.095	"They say, ""It's got to be something"
1000.095	that's nasty enough
1002.801	that people don't want
1002.801	to be hit with this weapon.
1005.265	So if you threaten to use it,
1006.692	people are going to comply with it.
1009.756	But it's also going to be something
1011.688	"that doesn't leave any lasting effects."""
1016.294	In other words,
1017.475	your perfect nonlethal weapon
1017.475	is something that's perfect for abuse.
1021.101	What would these guys have done
1021.101	if they'd had access to Tasers,
1024.674	or to a manned, portable version
1024.674	of the Active Denial System --
1028.959	a small heat ray that you
1028.959	can use on people
1031.447	and not worry about.
1033.803	So I think yes,
1035.484	there may be ways that nonlethal weapons
1035.484	will be great in these situations,
1039.058	but there's also a whole heap of problems
1041.041	that need to be considered as well.
1042.963	Thanks very much.
1044.147	(Applause)
