13.622	Today I want to confess something to you,
16.97	but first of all I'm going to ask you
16.97	a couple of questions.
19.889	How many people here have children?
23.496	And how many of you are confident
25.098	that you know how
25.098	to bring up your children
27.176	in exactly the right way?
28.435	(Laughter)
31.9	OK, I don't see too many hands
31.9	going up on that second one,
35.063	and that's my confession, too.
36.634	I've got three boys;
37.909	they're three, nine and 12.
39.74	And like you, and like most parents,
41.83	the honest truth is I have
41.83	pretty much no idea what I'm doing.
45.469	I want them to be
45.469	happy and healthy in their lives,
47.898	but I don't know what I'm supposed to do
49.908	to make sure they are happy and healthy.
51.938	There's so many books
51.938	offering all kinds of conflicting advice,
54.939	it can be really overwhelming.
56.499	So I've spent most of their lives
56.499	just making it up as I go along.
60.854	However, something changed me
60.854	a few years ago,
63.894	when I came across a little secret
63.894	that we have in Britain.
67.185	It's helped me become more confident
67.185	about how I bring up my own children,
70.69	and it's revealed a lot about
70.69	how we as a society can help all children.
74.624	I want to share that secret
74.624	with you today.
77.948	For the last 70 years,
79.909	scientists in Britain have been following
79.909	thousands of children through their lives
84.41	as part of an incredible scientific study.
87.291	There's nothing quite like it
87.291	anywhere else in the world.
90.732	Collecting information
90.732	on thousands of children
92.948	is a really powerful thing to do,
94.545	because it means we can compare
94.545	the ones who say,
96.856	do well at school or end up healthy
96.856	or happy or wealthy as adults,
100.29	and the ones who struggle much more,
102.102	and then we can sift through
102.102	all the information we've collected
105.127	and try to work out why
105.127	their lives turned out different.
108.051	This British study --
108.051	it's actually a kind of crazy story.
111.031	So it all starts back in 1946,
113.46	just a few months
113.46	after the end of the war,
115.725	when scientists wanted to know
117.18	what it was like for a woman
117.18	to have a baby at the time.
120.572	They carried out
120.572	this huge survey of mothers
123.003	and ended up recording the birth
123.003	of nearly every baby
125.972	born in England, Scotland
125.972	and Wales in one week.
128.947	That was nearly 14,000 babies.
132.324	The questions they asked these women
134.111	are very different than the ones
134.111	we might ask today.
136.597	They sound really old-fashioned now.
138.347	They asked them things like,
139.706	"""During pregnancy,"
140.936	did you get your full extra ration
140.936	"of a pint of milk a day?"""
145.276	"""How much did you spend"
145.276	on smocks, corsets,
148.618	"nightdresses, knickers and brassieres?"""
152.658	And this is my favorite one:
154.249	"""Who looked after your husband"
154.249	"while you were in bed with this baby?"""
157.525	(Laughter)
162.068	Now, this wartime study
162.068	actually ended up being so successful
165.487	that scientists did it again.
167.28	They recorded the births
167.28	of thousands of babies born in 1958
170.643	and thousands more in 1970.
172.916	They did it again in the early 1990s,
174.942	and again at the turn of the millennium.
177.014	Altogether, more than 70,000 children
177.014	have been involved in these studies
180.704	across those five generations.
182.741	They're called the British birth cohorts,
184.956	and scientists have gone back
184.956	and recorded more information
187.743	on all of these people
187.743	every few years ever since.
190.911	The amount of information
190.911	that's now been collected on these people
194.111	is just completely mind-boggling.
195.715	It includes thousands
195.715	of paper questionnaires
197.929	and terabytes' worth of computer data.
200.293	Scientists have also built up
200.293	a huge bank of tissue samples,
203.143	which includes locks of hair,
203.143	nail clippings, baby teeth and DNA.
208.318	They've even collected 9,000 placentas
208.318	from some of the births,
212.897	which are now pickled in plastic buckets
212.897	in a secure storage warehouse.
218.384	This whole project has become unique --
220.304	so, no other country in the world
220.304	is tracking generations of children
223.664	in quite this detail.
225.589	These are some of the best-studied
225.589	people on the planet,
228.644	and the data has become
228.644	incredibly valuable for scientists,
231.772	generating well over 6,000
231.772	academic papers and books.
236.525	But today I want to focus
236.525	on just one finding --
239.408	perhaps the most important discovery
239.408	to come from this remarkable study.
243.766	And it's also the one
243.766	that spoke to me personally,
246.128	because it's about how to use science
246.128	to do the best for our children.
250.408	So, let's get the bad news
250.408	out of the way first.
254.026	Perhaps the biggest message
254.026	from this remarkable study is this:
257.957	don't be born into poverty
257.957	or into disadvantage,
261.196	because if you are,
262.434	you're far more likely
262.434	to walk a difficult path in life.
265.923	Many children in this study
265.923	were born into poor families
268.829	or into working-class families that had
268.829	cramped homes or other problems,
273.18	and it's clear now
273.18	that those disadvantaged children
275.682	have been more likely to struggle
275.682	on almost every score.
278.798	They've been more likely
278.798	to do worse at school,
281.172	to end up with worse jobs
281.172	and to earn less money.
283.951	Now, maybe that sounds really obvious,
285.982	but some of the results
285.982	have been really surprising,
288.701	so children who had a tough start in life
290.678	are also more likely to end up
290.678	unhealthy as adults.
293.545	They're more likely to be overweight,
295.336	to have high blood pressure,
296.695	and then decades down the line,
298.812	more likely to have a failing memory,
298.812	poor health and even to die earlier.
305.597	Now, I talked about what happens later,
308.534	but some of these differences emerge
308.534	at a really shockingly early age.
312.221	In one study,
313.533	children who were growing up in poverty
315.452	were almost a year behind
315.452	the richer children on educational tests,
319.337	and that was by the age of just three.
322.319	These types of differences have been found
322.319	again and again across the generations.
326.201	It means that our early circumstances
326.201	have a profound influence
329.495	on the way that the rest
329.495	of our lives play out.
332.164	And working out why that is
333.618	is one of the most difficult questions
333.618	that we face today.
337.653	So there we have it.
339.334	The first lesson for successful life,
339.334	everyone, is this:
342.034	choose your parents very carefully.
343.914	(Laughter)
344.939	Don't be born into a poor family
344.939	or into a struggling family.
349.189	Now, I'm sure you can see
349.189	the small problem here.
351.95	We can't choose our parents
351.95	or how much they earn,
355.412	but this British study has also struck
355.412	a real note of optimism
358.665	by showing that not everyone
358.665	who has a disadvantaged start
362.04	ends up in difficult circumstances.
365.166	As you know, many people
365.166	have a tough start in life,
367.643	but they end up doing very well
367.643	on some measure nevertheless,
370.526	and this study starts to explain how.
373.157	So the second lesson is this:
375.282	parents really matter.
377.727	In this study,
378.902	children who had engaged,
378.902	interested parents,
381.044	ones who had ambition for their future,
383.132	were more likely to escape
383.132	from a difficult start.
385.99	It seems that parents and what they do
385.99	are really, really important,
390.039	especially in the first few years of life.
392.747	Let me give you an example of that.
394.439	In one study,
395.657	scientists looked at about 17,000 children
395.657	who were born in 1970.
400.599	They sifted all the mountains of data
400.599	that they had collected
403.57	to try to work out
404.821	what allowed the children
404.821	who'd had a difficult start in life
407.726	to go on and do well
407.726	at school nevertheless.
409.873	In other words, which ones beat the odds.
412.25	The data showed that what mattered
412.25	more than anything else was parents.
416.021	Having engaged, interested parents
416.021	in those first few years of life
419.643	was strongly linked to children going on
419.643	to do well at school later on.
424.058	In fact, quite small things
424.058	that parents do
427.048	are associated with good
427.048	outcomes for children.
430.19	Talking and listening to a child,
432.119	responding to them warmly,
434.047	teaching them their letters and numbers,
436.039	taking them on trips and visits.
437.735	Reading to children every day
437.735	seems to be really important, too.
441.324	So in one study,
442.736	children whose parents were reading
442.736	to them daily when they were five
446.047	and then showing an interest
446.047	in their education at the age of 10,
449.12	were significantly less likely
449.12	to be in poverty at the age of 30
453.165	than those whose parents
453.165	weren't doing those things.
456.931	Now, there are huge challenges
456.931	with interpreting this type of science.
461.501	These studies show
461.501	that certain things that parents do
464.18	are correlated with good
464.18	outcomes for children,
466.566	but we don't necessarily know
466.566	those behaviors caused the good outcomes,
470.003	or whether some other factor
470.003	is getting in the way.
472.409	For example, we have to take
472.409	genes into account,
474.678	and that's a whole other talk in itself.
477.309	But scientists working
477.309	with this British study
479.556	are working really hard to get at causes,
481.746	and this is one study I particularly love.
483.791	In this one,
484.997	they looked at the bedtime routines
484.997	of about 10,000 children
487.888	born at the turn of the millennium.
489.704	Were the children going to bed
489.704	at regular times,
492.057	or did they go to bed
492.057	at different times during the week?
494.979	The data showed that those children
494.979	who were going to bed at different times
498.576	were more likely
498.576	to have behavioral problems,
500.973	and then those that switched
500.973	to having regular bedtimes
503.706	often showed an improvement in behavior,
506.116	and that was really crucial,
507.496	because it suggested
507.496	it was the bedtime routines
509.792	that were really helping things
509.792	get better for those kids.
513.081	Here's another one to think about.
514.726	In this one,
515.908	scientists looked at children
515.908	who were reading for pleasure.
518.823	That means that they picked up
518.823	a magazine, a picture book, a story book.
523.626	The data showed that children
523.626	who were reading for pleasure
526.423	at the ages of five and 10
528.707	were more likely to go on in school
528.707	better, on average,
531.627	on school tests later in their lives.
533.622	And not just tests of reading,
535.351	but tests of spelling and maths as well.
538.325	This study tried to control
538.325	for all the confounding factors,
541.159	so it looked at children
541.159	who were equally intelligent
543.667	and from the same social-class background,
545.723	so it seemed as if it was the reading
545.723	which really helped those children
549.13	go on and score better on those
549.13	school tests later in their lives.
553.597	Now at the start,
554.771	I said the first lesson from this study
556.744	was not to be born into poverty
556.744	or into disadvantage,
559.316	because those children tend to follow
559.316	more difficult paths in their lives.
562.892	But then I said that parenting matters,
565.153	and that good parenting,
565.153	if you can call it that,
567.479	helps children beat the odds
568.839	and overcome some
568.839	of those early disadvantages.
571.666	So wait,
573.015	does that actually mean, then,
573.015	that poverty doesn't matter after all?
578.036	You could argue it doesn't matter
578.036	if a child is born poor --
581.072	as long as their parents are good parents,
581.072	they're going to do just fine.
584.817	I don't believe that's true.
586.248	This study shows that poverty
586.248	and parenting matter.
589.258	And one study actually
589.258	put figures on that,
591.282	so it looked at children
591.282	growing up in persistent poverty
594.005	and how well they were doing at school.
596.416	The data showed
597.591	that even when their parents
597.591	were doing everything right --
600.471	putting them to bed on time
601.797	and reading to them every day
601.797	and everything else --
604.258	that only got those children so far.
606.43	Good parenting only reduced
606.43	the educational gap
609.423	between the rich and poor children
609.423	by about 50 percent.
613.292	Now that means that poverty
613.292	leaves a really lasting scar,
617.467	and it means that if we really want
617.467	to ensure the success and well-being
620.873	of the next generation,
622.334	then tackling child poverty
622.334	is an incredibly important thing to do.
627.702	Now, what does all this mean
627.702	for you and me?
630.114	Are there lessons here
630.114	we can all take home and use?
632.568	As a scientist and a journalist,
634.122	I like to have some science
634.122	to inform my parenting ...
637.732	and I can tell you that when
637.732	you're shouting at your kids
640.513	to go to bed on time,
641.797	it really helps to have
641.797	the scientific literature on your side.
644.853	(Laughter)
645.896	And wouldn't it be great to think
647.523	that all we had to do to have
647.523	happy, successful children
650.256	was to talk to them,
650.256	be interested in their future,
652.979	put them to bed on time,
652.979	and give them a book to read?
655.577	Our job would be done.
657.189	Now, as you can imagine,
658.682	the answers aren't quite
658.682	as simple as that.
661.915	For one thing, this study
661.915	looks at what happens
664.13	to thousands and thousands
664.13	of children on average,
666.575	but that doesn't necessarily say
666.575	what will help my child or your child
670.197	or any individual child.
671.958	In the end, each of our children
671.958	is going to walk their own path,
675.19	and that's partly defined
675.19	by the genes they inherit
677.793	and of course all the experiences
677.793	they have through their lives,
680.818	including their interactions
680.818	with us, their parents.
683.294	I will tell you what I did
683.294	after I learned all this.
685.773	It's a bit embarrassing.
687.772	I realized I was so busy working,
690.269	and ironically,
691.452	learning and writing about this incredible
691.452	study of British children,
695.06	that there were days when I hardly
695.06	even spoke to my own British children.
699.266	So at home, we introduced talking time,
701.544	which is just 15 minutes
701.544	at the end of the day
703.712	when we talk and listen to the boys.
706.527	I try better now to ask them
706.527	what they did today,
709.862	and to show that I value
709.862	what they do at school.
712.805	Of course, I make sure
712.805	they always have a book to read.
715.471	I tell them I'm ambitious
715.471	for their future,
717.74	and I think they can be happy
717.74	and do great things.
721.829	I don't know that any of that
721.829	will make a difference,
724.635	but I'm pretty confident
724.635	it won't do them any harm,
727.049	and it might even do them some good.
729.555	Ultimately, if we want happy children,
732.423	all we can do is listen to the science,
734.487	and of course,
735.677	listen to our children themselves.
737.527	Thank you.
