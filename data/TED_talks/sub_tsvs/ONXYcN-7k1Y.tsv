16.148	Thirteen trillion dollars in wealth
18.26	has evaporated over the course
18.26	of the last two years.
21.813	We've questioned the future of capitalism.
24.134	We've questioned the financial industry.
26.51	We've looked at our government oversight.
28.51	We've questioned where we're going.
30.228	And yet, at the same time,
31.561	this very well may be
31.561	a seminal moment in American history,
34.461	an opportunity for the consumer
34.461	to actually take control and guide us
38.81	to a new trajectory in America.
41.01	I'm calling this The Great Unwind.
42.759	(Laughter)
43.785	And the idea is a simple, simple idea,
46.41	which is the fact that the consumer
46.41	has moved from a state of anxiety
50.514	to action.
51.696	Consumers who represent 72 percent
51.696	of the GDP of America
55.959	have actually started, just like banks
55.959	and just like businesses,
59.427	to de-leverage, to unwind
59.427	their leverage in daily life,
63.535	to remove themselves
63.535	from the liability and risk
66.51	that presents itself as they move forward.
69.41	So, to understand this --
69.41	and I'm going to stress this --
72.167	it's not about the consumer
72.167	being in retreat.
74.354	The consumer is empowered.
75.738	To understand this, we'll step back
75.738	and look at what's happened
79.019	over the last year and a half.
80.938	So if you've been gone,
80.938	this is the CliffsNotes
83.181	on what's happened in the economy.
84.829	(Laughter)
85.857	Unemployment up. Housing values down.
85.857	Equity markets down.
88.951	Commodity prices are like this.
90.581	If you're a mom trying to manage a budget,
92.853	and oil was 150 dollars
92.853	a barrel last summer,
95.542	and it's somewhere between 50 and 70,
97.339	do you plan vacations?
98.526	How do you buy?
99.708	What's your strategy in your household?
99.708	Will the bailout work?
102.652	We have national debt, Detroit,
102.652	currency valuations, health care --
105.851	all these issues facing us.
107.172	You put them all together,
107.172	mix them up in a bouillabaisse,
109.922	and you have consumer confidence
109.922	that's basically a ticking time bomb.
113.277	In fact, let's go back and look
113.277	at what caused this crisis,
116.278	because the consumer,
116.278	all of us, in our daily lives,
118.78	actually contributed
118.78	a large part to the problem.
121.28	This is something I call
121.28	the 50-20 paradox.
124.084	It took us 50 years
126.86	to reach annual savings ratings
126.86	of almost 10 percent.
130.64	Fifty years.
131.86	Do you know what this was right here?
131.86	This was World War II.
134.762	Do you know why savings was so high?
136.6	There was nothing to buy,
136.6	unless you wanted to buy some rivets.
139.934	What happened, though,
139.934	over the course of the last 20 years,
142.888	we went from a 10 percent savings rate
142.888	to a negative savings rate.
147.072	Because we binged.
148.749	We bought extra-large cars,
148.749	supersized everything,
152.566	we bought remedies
152.566	for restless leg syndrome.
155.298	All these things together
155.298	basically created a factor
159.228	where the consumer drove us
159.228	headlong into the crisis
161.84	that we face today.
163.137	The personal debt-to-income ratio
163.137	basically went from 65 to 135 percent
169.438	in the span of about 15 years.
171.97	So consumers got over-leveraged.
174.081	And of course our banks did as well,
174.081	as did our federal government.
177.286	This is an absolutely staggering chart.
179.376	It shows leverage,
179.376	trended out from 1919 to 2009.
184.007	And what you end up seeing
184.007	is the whole phenomenon
186.683	that we are actually stepping forth
186.683	and basically leveraging
190.563	future education, future children
190.563	in our households.
193.766	So if you look at this in the context
193.766	of visualizing the bailout,
196.89	what you can see is,
196.89	if you stack up dollar bills,
199.41	first of all, 360,000 dollars
201.676	is about the size of a five-foot-four guy.
204.219	But if you stack it up, you see
204.219	this amazing, staggering amount of dollars
208.52	that have been put into the system
208.52	to fund and bail us out.
211.41	So this is the first 315 billion.
213.599	But I read this fact the other day,
215.396	that one trillion seconds
215.396	equals 32,000 years.
218.73	So if you think about that,
220.071	the context, the casualness
220.071	with which we talk about
222.591	trillion-dollar bailout here
222.591	and trillion there,
224.868	we are stacking ourselves up
224.868	for long-term leverage.
228.277	However, consumers have moved.
230.953	They are taking responsibility.
233.016	What we're seeing
233.016	is an uptake in the savings rate.
235.569	In fact, 11 straight months
235.569	of savings have happened
238.308	since the beginning of the crisis.
239.979	We're working our way back up
239.979	to that 10 percent.
242.367	Also, remarkably, in the fourth quarter,
244.321	spending dropped
244.321	to its lowest level in 62 years --
247.726	almost a 3.7 percent decline.
250.41	Visa now reports that more people
250.41	are using debit cards than credit cards.
254.314	So we're starting to pay for things
254.314	with money that we have.
257.731	And we're starting to be much more careful
257.731	about how we save and invest.
261.41	But that's not really the whole story,
263.41	because this has also been a dramatic
263.41	time of transformation.
266.351	And you've got to admit,
266.351	over the last year and a half,
269.001	consumers have been doing
269.001	some weird things.
271.093	It's pretty staggering,
271.093	what we've lived through.
273.408	If you take into account
273.408	that 80 percent of all Americans
276.128	were born after World War II,
277.548	this was essentially our Depression.
279.305	And so, as a result,
279.305	some crazy things have happened.
282.134	I'll give you some examples.
283.508	Let's talk about dentists, vasectomies,
283.508	guns and shark attacks.
288.197	(Laughter)
290.009	Dentists report molars --
290.009	people grinding their teeth,
293.916	coming in and reporting
293.916	that they've had stress.
296.303	So there's an increase in people
296.303	having to have their fillings replaced.
299.749	Gun sales, according to the FBI,
299.749	who does background checks,
303.067	are up almost 25 percent since January.
306.185	Vasectomies are up 48 percent,
306.185	according to the Cornell Institute.
310.862	And lastly, but a very good point,
313.29	hopefully not related
313.29	to the former point I just made,
315.89	which is that shark attacks
315.89	are at their lowest level from 2003.
319.377	Does anybody know why?
321.271	(Laughter)
322.477	No one's at the beach.
323.669	So there's a bright side to everything.
325.589	But seriously, what we see happening,
327.799	and the reason I want to stress
327.799	that the consumer is not in retreat,
331.084	is that this is a tremendous opportunity
333.123	for the consumer who drove us
333.123	into this recession
335.741	to lead us right back out.
337.29	What I mean by that is we can
337.29	move from mindless consumption
340.656	to mindful consumption.
342.708	Right?
343.892	(Applause)
344.991	If you think about the last three decades,
347.047	the consumer has moved
347.047	from savvy about marketing in the '90s,
350.353	to gathering all these amazing social
350.353	and search tools in this decade.
354.354	But the one thing holding them back
354.354	is the ability to discriminate.
357.707	By restricting their demand,
359.068	consumers can actually align
359.068	their values with their spending,
362.41	and drive capitalism and business
362.41	to not just be about more,
366.014	but to be about better.
367.204	We're going to explain that right now.
369.205	Based on Y&amp;R's BrandAsset Valuator,
372.01	proprietary tool of VML
372.01	and Young &amp; Rubicam,
374.735	we set out to understand
374.735	what's been happening in the crisis
377.643	with the consumer marketplace.
379.208	We found a couple
379.208	of really interesting things.
381.449	We're going to go
381.449	through four value shifts
383.9	that we see driving
383.9	new consumer behaviors,
386.26	that offer new management principles.
388.341	The first cultural value shift we see
390.175	is this tendency toward something
390.175	"we call ""liquid life."""
392.825	This is the movement
393.999	from Americans defining
393.999	their success on having things
397.104	to having liquidity,
398.41	because the less excess
398.41	that you have around you,
401.126	the more nimble and fleet of foot you are.
403.302	As a result, déclassé consumption is in.
405.796	Déclassé consumption is the whole idea
405.796	that spending money frivolously
409.755	makes you look a little bit anti-fashion.
412.517	The management principle
412.517	is dollars and cents.
415.03	So let's look at some examples
415.03	of this déclassé consumption
417.898	that falls out of this value.
419.35	The first thing is,
419.35	something must be happening
421.671	when P. Diddy vows to tone down his bling.
423.771	(Laughter)
424.809	But seriously, we also have
424.809	this phenomenon
427.175	on Madison Avenue and in other places,
429.124	where people are actually
429.124	walking out of luxury boutiques
432.071	with ordinary, generic paper bags
432.071	to hide the brand purchases.
435.908	We see high-end haggling in fashion today,
438.909	high-end haggling
438.909	for luxury and real estate.
441.41	We also see just a relaxing of ego,
443.806	and sort of a dismantling of artifice.
446.082	This is a story on the yacht club
446.082	that's all basically blue collar.
449.953	Blue-collar yacht club --
449.953	where you can join,
452.151	but you've got to work in the boatyard
452.151	as condition of membership.
455.41	We also see the trend toward tourism
455.41	that's a little bit more low-key:
460.095	agritourism -- going to vineyards
460.095	and going to farms.
463.246	And then we also see this movement
463.246	forward from dollars and cents.
466.895	What businesses can do to connect
466.895	with these new mindsets
469.634	is really interesting.
470.825	A couple things that are kind of cool.
472.694	One is that Frito-Lay figured out
472.694	this liquidity thing with their consumer.
476.411	They found their consumer had more
476.411	money at the beginning of the month,
479.838	less at the end of the month.
481.271	So they started to change their packaging:
483.308	larger packs at the beginning
483.308	of the month,
485.354	smaller packaging at the end of the month.
487.398	Really interestingly, too,
487.398	was the San Francisco Giants.
490.141	They've just instituted dynamic pricing.
492.41	It takes into account everything
492.41	from the pitcher match-ups,
495.653	to the weather, to the team records,
497.52	in setting prices for the consumer.
499.948	Another quick example of these types
499.948	of movements is the rise of Zynga.
505.003	Zynga has risen on the consumer's desire
507.307	to not want to be locked in to fixed cost.
509.343	Again, this theme is about variable
509.343	cost, variable living.
512.127	So micro-payments have become huge.
514.023	And lastly, some people are using Hulu
516.626	as a device to get rid
516.626	of their cable bill.
518.722	So, really clever ideas there
518.722	that are being taken ahold of
522.336	and that marketers
522.336	are starting to understand.
524.531	The second of the four values
524.531	is this movement toward
527.185	ethics and fair play.
528.514	We see that play itself out
528.514	with empathy and respect.
531.675	The consumer is demanding it.
533.32	And, as a result, businesses
533.32	must provide not only value,
536.51	but values.
537.686	Increasingly, consumers are looking
537.686	at the culture of the company,
540.883	at their conduct in the marketplace.
542.652	So we see with empathy and respect
544.344	lots of really hopeful things
544.344	come out of this recession.
547.164	I'll give you a few examples.
548.579	One is the rise toward communities
548.579	and neighborhoods,
551.128	and increased emphasis on your neighbors
551.128	as your support system.
554.866	Also, a wonderful by-product
554.866	of a really lousy thing,
558.937	which has been unemployment,
560.329	is a rise in volunteerism
560.329	that's been noted in our country.
563.154	We also see the phenomenon --
563.154	"some of you may have ""boomerang kids"" --"
566.848	"these are ""boomerang alumni,"""
568.509	where universities are actually
568.509	reconnecting with alumni
571.266	and helping them with jobs,
571.266	sharing skills and retraining.
574.071	We also talked about character
574.071	and professionalism.
576.643	We had this miracle on the Hudson
576.643	in New York City in January,
580.41	and suddenly Sully has become
580.41	a key name on BabyCenter.
584.41	(Laughter)
585.504	So, from a value and values standpoint,
587.924	what companies can do is connect
587.924	in lots of different ways.
590.901	Microsoft is doing something wonderful.
592.817	They are actually vowing to retrain
592.817	two million Americans with IT training,
596.679	using their existing infrastructure
596.679	to do something good.
599.805	Also, a really interesting
599.805	company is GORE-TEX.
602.29	GORE-TEX is all about
602.29	personal accountability
605.024	of their management and their employees,
606.997	to the point where they really
606.997	kind of shun the idea of bosses.
610.579	But they also talk about the fact
610.579	that their executives --
613.368	all of their expense reports
613.368	are put onto their company intranet
616.464	for everyone to see.
617.667	Complete transparency.
619.41	Think twice before you have
619.41	that bottle of wine.
621.71	(Laughter)
622.791	The third of the four laws
622.791	of post-crisis consumerism
625.588	is about durable living.
627.097	We're seeing in our data
627.097	that consumers are realizing
629.658	this is a marathon, not a sprint.
631.41	They're digging in and looking
631.41	for ways to extract value
634.293	out of every purchase they make.
636.41	Witness the fact that Americans
636.41	are holding on to their cars
639.349	longer than ever before:
639.349	9.4 years on average, in March.
643.235	A record.
644.41	We also see the fact that libraries
644.41	have become a huge resource for America.
648.41	Did you know that 68 percent
648.41	of Americans now carry a library card?
652.276	The highest percentage ever
652.276	in our nation's history.
654.765	So what you see in this trend
654.765	is also the accumulation of knowledge.
658.41	Continuing education is up.
660.153	Everything is focused
660.153	on betterment, training,
662.815	development and moving forward.
664.624	We also see a big DIY movement.
667.684	I was fascinated to learn that 30 percent
667.684	of all homes in America
671.872	are actually built by owners.
673.41	That includes cottages and the like,
675.292	but 30 percent.
676.484	People are getting their hands dirty,
676.484	rolling up their sleeves.
679.52	They want these skills.
680.711	We see it with the phenomenon of raising
680.711	backyard hens, chickens and ducks.
684.299	And when you work out the math,
684.299	they say it doesn't work,
687.011	but the principle is there;
688.335	it's about being sustainable
688.335	and taking care of yourself.
691.074	Then we look at the High Line
691.074	in New York City,
693.709	an excellent use of reimagining
693.709	existing infrastructure
696.501	for something good,
697.684	which is a brand-new park
697.684	in New York City.
699.743	So what brands can do, and companies,
699.743	is pay dividends to consumers,
703.858	be a brand that lasts,
705.41	offer transparency,
706.823	promise you're going to be there
706.823	beyond today's sale.
709.341	Perfect example of that is Patagonia.
711.41	"Patagonia's ""Footprint Chronicles"""
713.148	basically goes through and tracks
713.148	every product they make,
716.97	and gives you social responsibility,
718.784	and helps you understand the ethics
718.784	behind the product they make.
722.347	Another great example is Fidelity.
724.153	Rather than instant cash-back rewards
724.153	on your credit or debit purchases,
727.863	this is about 529 rewards
727.863	for your student education.
732.783	Or the interesting company Sunrun.
734.894	I love this company.
736.073	They've created a consumer collective
738.164	where they put solar panels on households
740.534	and create a consumer-based utility,
742.653	where the electricity they generate
744.375	is basically pumped back out
744.375	into the marketplace.
747.023	So it's a consumer-driven co-op.
748.783	The fourth post-crisis
748.783	consumerism that we see
752.481	is this movement
752.481	"about ""return to the fold."""
754.822	It's incredibly important right now.
756.645	Trust is not parceled out, as we all know.
759.253	It's now about connecting
759.253	to your communities,
761.469	connecting to your social networks.
763.255	In my book, I talked about the fact
764.993	that 72 percent of people trust
764.993	what other people say
767.692	about a brand or a company,
769.167	versus 15 percent on advertising.
771.233	So in that respect, cooperative
771.233	consumerism has really taken off.
774.977	This is about consumers working
774.977	together to get what they want
777.984	out of the marketplace.
779.184	Let's look at a couple of quick examples.
781.185	The artisanal movement is huge:
782.782	everything about locally
782.782	derived products and services,
785.863	supporting your local neighborhoods,
787.671	whether it's cheeses,
787.671	wines and other products.
790.671	Also this rise of local currencies.
793.353	Realizing that it's difficult
793.353	to get loans in this environment,
796.352	you're doing business
796.352	with people you trust
798.435	in your local markets.
799.638	So this rise of local currency
799.638	is another really interesting phenomenon.
803.53	And then they did a recent report
803.53	I thought was fascinating.
807.176	They actually started, in certain
807.176	communities in the United States,
810.373	to publish people's electricity usage.
812.424	And what they found out is when
812.424	that was available for public record,
815.759	the people's electricity usage
815.759	in those communities dropped.
819.771	Then we also look
819.771	at the idea of cow-pooling,
822.41	which is the whole phenomenon
822.41	of consumers organizing together
826.629	to buy meat from organic farms,
826.629	that they know is safe and controlled
830.546	in the way that they want it
830.546	to be controlled.
832.756	And then there's this other really
832.756	interesting movement in California,
836.347	which is about carrot mobs.
837.854	The traditional thing would be
837.854	to boycott, right? Have a stick.
840.924	Well, why not have a carrot?
842.294	So these are consumers organizing,
842.294	pooling their resources
845.622	to incentify companies to do good.
848.41	And then we look at what companies can do.
851.231	This is all the opportunity
851.231	about being a community organizer.
854.708	You have to realize
854.708	that you can't fight and control this.
857.699	You actually need to organize it.
859.333	You need to harness it.
859.333	You need to give it meaning.
861.882	And there's lots of really
861.882	interesting examples here.
865.118	First is just the rise of the fact
865.118	that Zagat's has actually moved out of
869.935	and diversified from rating restaurants,
872.187	into actually rating health care.
874.41	So what credentials does Zagat's have?
876.563	Well, they have a lot,
877.757	because it's their network of people.
879.625	So that becomes
879.625	a very powerful force for them
882.192	to make their brand more elastic.
884.41	Then you look at the phenomenon of Kogi.
887.196	This Kogi doesn't exist.
887.196	It's a moving truck.
890.197	It's a moving truck through L.A.,
891.82	and the only way you can find it
891.82	is through Twitter.
894.34	(Laughter)
895.421	Or you look at
896.598	"Johnson &amp; Johnson's ""Momversations,"""
896.598	a phenomenal blog that's been built up,
901.684	where J&amp;J basically is tapping
901.684	into the power of mommy bloggers,
905.838	allowing them to create a forum
905.838	where they can communicate and connect.
910.31	And it's also become a very valuable
910.31	advertising revenue for J&amp;J as well.
915.173	This, plus the fact that you've got
915.173	phenomenal work from CEOs,
919.411	from Ford to Zappos,
919.411	connecting on Twitter,
921.975	creating an open environment,
923.41	allowing their employees
923.41	to be part of the process,
926.472	rather than hidden behind walls.
928.204	You see this rising force
928.204	in total transparency and openness
932.433	that companies are starting to adopt,
934.245	all because the consumer is demanding it.
936.576	So when we look at this and step back,
938.546	what I believe is that the crisis
938.546	that exists today is definitely real.
942.762	It's been tremendously
942.762	powerful for consumers.
945.41	But at the same time,
945.41	this is also a tremendous opportunity.
948.997	The Chinese character for crisis
948.997	is actually the same side
952.488	of the same coin.
953.679	Crisis equals opportunity.
955.41	What we're seeing with consumers
955.41	right now is the ability for them
958.928	to actually lead us forward
958.928	out of this recession.
961.588	So we believe that values-driven spending
961.588	will force capitalism to be better:
966.41	it will drive innovation;
968.314	it will make longer-lasting products;
970.439	it will create better,
970.439	more intuitive customer service;
973.059	and it will give us the opportunity
973.059	to connect with companies
975.96	that share the values that we share.
978.055	So when we look back and step out at this
980.098	and see the beginning of these trends
980.098	that we're seeing in our data,
983.41	we see a very hopeful picture
983.41	for the future of America.
986.283	Thank you very much.
987.475	(Applause)
