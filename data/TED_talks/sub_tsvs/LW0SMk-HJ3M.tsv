25	I’d like to dedicate this one to all the women in South Africa --
31	those women who refused to dwindle in the midst of apartheid.
36	And, of course, I’m dedicating it also to my grandmother,
42	whom I think really played quite a lot of important roles,
45	especially for me when I was an activist, and being harassed by the police.
51	You will recall that in 1976, June 16, the students of South Africa boycotted
56	the language of Afrikaans as the medium of the oppressor,
60	as they were sort of like really told
63	that they must do everything in Afrikaans --
66	biology, mathematics -- and what about our languages?
70	And the students wanted to speak to the government,
74	and police answered with bullets.
76	So every year, June 16, we will commemorate
78	all those comrades or students who died.
82	And I was very young then. I think I was 11 years,
88	and I started asking questions,
90	and that’s when my political education started.
93	And I joined, later on, the youth organization
96	under the African National Congress.
99	So as part of organizing this and whatever,
102	this commemoration, the police will round us up
105	as they call us leaders.
108	And I used to run away from home,
110	when I know that maybe the police might be coming
113	around the ninth or 10th of June or so.
116	And my grandmother one time said,
118	"""No, look, you’re not going to run away."
121	"This is your place, you stay here."""
125	And indeed, the police came -- because they’ll just arrest us
129	and put us in jail and release us whenever they feel like, after the 20th or so.
134	So it was on the 10th of June, and they came, and they surrounded the house,
139	and my grandmother switched off all the lights in the house,
145	and opened the kitchen door.
148	"And she said to them, ""Vusi's here, and you're not going to take him tonight."
153	I'm tired of you having to come here, harassing us,
156	while your children are sleeping peacefully in your homes.
158	He is here, and you're not going to take him.
161	"I've got a bowl full of boiling water -- the first one who comes in here, gets it."""
168	And they left.
