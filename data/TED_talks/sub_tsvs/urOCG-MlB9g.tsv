12.46	As patients,
13.7	we usually remember
13.7	the names of our doctors,
17.34	but often we forget
17.34	the names of our nurses.
21.42	I remember one.
23.22	I had breast cancer a few years ago,
25.46	and somehow I managed
25.46	to get through the surgeries
28.94	and the beginning
28.94	of the treatment just fine.
31.66	I could hide what was going on.
33.94	Everybody didn't really have to know.
36.18	I could walk my daughter to school,
38.42	I could go out to dinner with my husband;
40.42	I could fool people.
42.54	But then my chemo was scheduled to begin
44.9	and that terrified me
46.66	because I knew that I was going to lose
46.66	every single hair on my body
51.22	because of the kind of chemo
51.22	that I was going to have.
54.3	I wasn't going to be able
54.3	to pretend anymore
56.62	as though everything was normal.
59.26	I was scared.
60.58	I knew what it felt like to have
60.58	everybody treating me with kid gloves,
64.18	and I just wanted to feel normal.
66.58	I had a port installed in my chest.
68.78	I went to my first day of chemotherapy,
71.58	and I was an emotional wreck.
73.94	My nurse, Joanne, walked in the door,
76.98	and every bone in my body was telling
76.98	me to get up out of that chair
80.98	and take for the hills.
82.5	But Joanne looked at me and talked
82.5	to me like we were old friends.
87.06	And then she asked me,
88.5	"""Where'd you get your highlights done?"""
90.62	(Laughter)
91.74	And I was like, are you kidding me?
93.7	You're going to talk to me about my hair
93.7	when I'm on the verge of losing it?
98.58	I was kind of angry,
100.34	"and I said, ""Really? Hair?"""
103.46	And with a shrug
103.46	of her shoulders she said,
105.82	"""It's gonna grow back."""
108.1	And in that moment she said
108.1	the one thing I had overlooked,
111.38	and that was that at some point,
111.38	my life would get back to normal.
115.22	She really believed that.
116.94	And so I believed it, too.
119.34	Now, worrying about losing your hair
119.34	when you're fighting cancer
124.14	may seem silly at first,
125.78	but it's not just that you're worried
125.78	about how you're going to look.
129.94	It's that you're worried that everybody's
129.94	going to treat you so carefully.
134.58	Joanne made me feel normal
134.58	for the first time in six months.
138.14	We talked about her boyfriends,
140.019	we talked about looking
140.019	for apartments in New York City,
142.78	and we talked about my reaction
142.78	to the chemotherapy --
145.66	all kind of mixed in together.
148.18	And I always wondered,
150.18	how did she so instinctively
150.18	know just how to talk to me?
155.3	Joanne Staha and my admiration for her
158.74	marked the beginning of my journey
158.74	into the world of nurses.
163.18	A few years later,
163.18	I was asked to do a project
165.62	that would celebrate
165.62	the work that nurses do.
168.94	I started with Joanne,
170.46	and I met over 100 nurses
170.46	across the country.
174.14	I spent five years interviewing,
174.14	photographing and filming nurses
179.22	for a book and a documentary film.
182.38	With my team,
183.62	we mapped a trip across America
183.62	that would take us to places
186.98	dealing with some of the biggest
186.98	public health issues facing our nation --
191.94	aging, war, poverty, prisons.
196.66	And then we went places
197.94	where we would find
197.94	the largest concentration of patients
201.82	dealing with those issues.
204.1	Then we asked hospitals and facilities
204.1	to nominate nurses
208.18	who would best represent them.
210.62	One of the first nurses I met
210.62	was Bridget Kumbella.
214.02	Bridget was born in Cameroon,
215.66	the oldest of four children.
218.22	Her father was at work
218.22	when he had fallen from the fourth floor
222.1	and really hurt his back.
224.1	And he talked a lot about what it was like
224.1	to be flat on your back
228.26	and not get the kind
228.26	of care that you need.
231.22	And that propelled Bridget
231.22	to go into the profession of nursing.
235.82	Now, as a nurse in the Bronx,
237.46	she has a really diverse group
237.46	of patients that she cares for,
240.9	from all walks of life,
242.82	and from all different religions.
245.22	And she's devoted her career
245.22	to understanding the impact
249.42	of our cultural differences
249.42	when it comes to our health.
254.1	She spoke of a patient --
255.46	a Native American patient that she had --
258.18	that wanted to bring
258.18	a bunch of feathers into the ICU.
262.9	That's how he found spiritual comfort.
265.94	And she spoke of advocating for him
268.18	and said that patients come
268.18	from all different religions
270.98	and use all different kinds
270.98	of objects for comfort;
274.9	whether it's a holy rosary
274.9	or a symbolic feather,
278.18	it all needs to be supported.
281.02	This is Jason Short.
282.86	Jason is a home health nurse
282.86	in the Appalachian mountains,
285.94	and his dad had a gas station
285.94	and a repair shop when he was growing up.
290.34	So he worked on cars in the community
290.34	that he now serves as a nurse.
295.42	When he was in college,
296.7	it was just not macho at all
296.7	to become a nurse,
300.38	so he avoided it for years.
302.58	He drove trucks for a little while,
304.54	but his life path was always
304.54	pulling him back to nursing.
310.06	As a nurse in the Appalachian mountains,
312.06	Jason goes places
312.06	that an ambulance can't even get to.
315.9	In this photograph,
315.9	he's standing in what used to be a road.
319.9	Top of the mountain mining
319.9	flooded that road,
322.74	and now the only way
322.74	for Jason to get to the patient
326.06	living in that house
326.06	with black lung disease
328.98	is to drive his SUV
328.98	against the current up that creek.
334.18	The day I was with him,
334.18	we ripped the front fender off the car.
337.98	The next morning he got up,
337.98	put the car on the lift,
341.22	fixed the fender,
342.5	and then headed out
342.5	to meet his next patient.
345.5	I witnessed Jason
345.5	caring for this gentleman
348.78	with such enormous compassion,
351.62	and I was struck again by how intimate
351.62	the work of nursing really is.
357.86	When I met Brian McMillion, he was raw.
360.98	He had just come back from a deployment
363.62	and he hadn't really settled back in
363.62	to life in San Diego yet.
368.22	He talked about his experience
368.22	of being a nurse in Germany
371.78	and taking care of the soldiers
371.78	coming right off the battlefield.
375.78	Very often, he would be
375.78	the first person they would see
379.58	when they opened
379.58	their eyes in the hospital.
382.3	And they would look at him
382.3	as they were lying there,
384.9	missing limbs,
386.58	and the first thing they would say is,
389.22	"""When can I go back?"
389.22	"I left my brothers out there."""
393.9	And Brian would have to say,
395.46	"""You're not going anywhere."
397.06	"You've already given enough, brother."""
399.82	Brian is both a nurse and a soldier
399.82	who's seen combat.
405.1	So that puts him in a unique position
407.18	to be able to relate to and help heal
407.18	the veterans in his care.
413.38	This is Sister Stephen,
414.9	and she runs a nursing home
414.9	in Wisconsin called Villa Loretto.
419.14	And the entire circle of life
419.14	can be found under her roof.
423.62	She grew up wishing they lived on a farm,
426.1	so given the opportunity
426.1	to adopt local farm animals,
430.82	she enthusiastically brings them in.
433.9	And in the springtime,
433.9	those animals have babies.
437.46	And Sister Stephen uses
437.46	those baby ducks, goats and lambs
442.66	as animal therapy
442.66	for the residents at Villa Loretto
446.94	who sometimes can't
446.94	remember their own name,
450.3	but they do rejoice
450.3	in the holding of a baby lamb.
455.22	The day I was with Sister Stephen,
457.06	I needed to take her away
457.06	from Villa Loretto
459.18	to film part of her story.
461.3	And before we left,
462.58	she went into the room of a dying patient.
465.82	And she leaned over and she said,
468.62	"""I have to go away for the day,"
471.34	but if Jesus calls you,
473.06	you go.
474.3	"You go straight home to Jesus."""
477.1	I was standing there and thinking
479.7	it was the first time in my life
481.74	I witnessed that you could show
481.74	someone you love them completely
486.06	by letting go.
487.86	We don't have to hold on so tightly.
491.22	I saw more life rolled up at Villa Loretto
494.82	than I have ever seen at any other time
494.82	at any other place in my life.
501.14	We live in a complicated time
501.14	when it comes to our health care.
505.22	It's easy to lose sight
505.22	of the need for quality of life,
509.42	not just quantity of life.
511.94	As new life-saving
511.94	technologies are created,
515.38	we're going to have really
515.38	complicated decisions to make.
519.1	These technologies often save lives,
521.98	but they can also prolong pain
521.98	and the dying process.
527.739	How in the world are we supposed
527.739	to navigate these waters?
530.66	We're going to need
530.66	all the help we can get.
533.58	Nurses have a really unique
533.58	relationship with us
537.18	because of the time spent at bedside.
540.58	During that time,
541.82	a kind of emotional intimacy develops.
546.46	This past summer, on August 9,
549.06	my father died of a heart attack.
552.42	My mother was devastated,
554.1	and she couldn't imagine
554.1	her world without him in it.
559.18	Four days later she fell,
561.14	she broke her hip,
563.02	she needed surgery
564.54	and she found herself
564.54	fighting for her own life.
568.7	Once again I found myself
570.46	on the receiving end
570.46	of the care of nurses --
573.46	this time for my mom.
576.02	My brother and my sister and I
576.02	stayed by her side
578.58	for the next three days in the ICU.
581.78	And as we tried
581.78	to make the right decisions
584.94	and follow my mother's wishes,
587.34	we found that we were depending
587.34	upon the guidance of nurses.
592.02	And once again,
593.5	they didn't let us down.
596.42	They had an amazing insight
596.42	in terms of how to care for my mom
601.22	in the last four days of her life.
603.5	They brought her comfort
603.5	and relief from pain.
608.14	They knew to encourage my sister and I
608.14	to put a pretty nightgown on my mom,
613.42	long after it mattered to her,
615.34	but it sure meant a lot to us.
618.82	And they knew to come and wake me up
618.82	just in time for my mom's last breath.
625.42	And then they knew
625.42	how long to leave me in the room
627.86	with my mother after she died.
630.78	I have no idea how they know these things,
634.54	but I do know that I am eternally grateful
637.7	that they've guided me once again.
640.74	Thank you so very much.
642.26	(Applause)
