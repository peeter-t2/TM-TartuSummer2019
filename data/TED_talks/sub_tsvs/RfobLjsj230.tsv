26	I am very, very happy to be amidst some of the most --
30	the lights are really disturbing my eyes
32	and they're reflecting on my glasses.
34	I am very happy and honored to be amidst
38	very, very innovative and intelligent people.
41	I have listened to the three previous speakers,
44	and guess what happened?
46	Every single thing I planned to say, they have said it here,
49	and it looks and sounds like I have nothing else to say.
54	(Laughter)
55	But there is a saying in my culture
58	that if a bud leaves a tree without saying something,
63	that bud is a young one.
66	So, I will -- since I am not young and am very old,
71	I still will say something.
73	We are hosting this conference at a very opportune moment,
78	because another conference is taking place in Berlin.
80	It is the G8 Summit.
83	The G8 Summit proposes that the solution to Africa's problems
90	should be a massive increase in aid,
93	something akin to the Marshall Plan.
95	Unfortunately, I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan.
99	One, because the benefits of the Marshall Plan have been overstated.
104	Its largest recipients were Germany and France,
107	and it was only 2.5 percent of their GDP.
110	An average African country receives foreign aid
113	to the tune of 13, 15 percent of its GDP,
119	and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources
122	from rich countries to poor countries.
125	But I want to say that there are two things we need to connect.
128	How the media covers Africa in the West, and the consequences of that.
134	By displaying despair, helplessness and hopelessness,
137	the media is telling the truth about Africa, and nothing but the truth.
143	However, the media is not telling us the whole truth.
147	Because despair, civil war, hunger and famine,
151	although they're part and parcel of our African reality,
155	they are not the only reality.
157	And secondly, they are the smallest reality.
159	Africa has 53 nations.
161	We have civil wars only in six countries,
164	which means that the media are covering only six countries.
168	Africa has immense opportunities that never navigate
172	through the web of despair and helplessness
174	that the Western media largely presents to its audience.
179	But the effect of that presentation is, it appeals to sympathy.
183	It appeals to pity. It appeals to something called charity.
188	And, as a consequence, the Western view
191	of Africa's economic dilemma is framed wrongly.
196	The wrong framing is a product of thinking
200	that Africa is a place of despair.
203	What should we do with it? We should give food to the hungry.
206	We should deliver medicines to those who are ill.
209	We should send peacekeeping troops
211	to serve those who are facing a civil war.
213	And in the process, Africa has been stripped of self-initiative.
218	I want to say that it is important to recognize
221	that Africa has fundamental weaknesses.
224	But equally, it has opportunities and a lot of potential.
228	We need to reframe the challenge that is facing Africa,
232	from a challenge of despair,
234	which is called poverty reduction,
238	to a challenge of hope.
240	We frame it as a challenge of hope, and that is worth creation.
244	The challenge facing all those who are interested in Africa
247	is not the challenge of reducing poverty.
249	It should be a challenge of creating wealth.
252	Once we change those two things --
255	if you say the Africans are poor and they need poverty reduction,
260	you have the international cartel of good intentions
264	moving onto the continent, with what?
267	Medicines for the poor, food relief for those who are hungry,
270	and peacekeepers for those who are facing civil war.
275	And in the process, none of these things really are productive
279	because you are treating the symptoms, not the causes
281	of Africa's fundamental problems.
284	Sending somebody to school and giving them medicines,
287	ladies and gentlemen, does not create wealth for them.
292	Wealth is a function of income, and income comes from you finding
296	a profitable trading opportunity or a well-paying job.
300	Now, once we begin to talk about wealth creation in Africa,
303	our second challenge will be,
305	who are the wealth-creating agents in any society?
308	They are entrepreneurs. [Unclear] told us they are always
312	about four percent of the population, but 16 percent are imitators.
316	But they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship.
321	So, where should we be putting the money?
324	We need to put money where it can productively grow.
329	Support private investment in Africa, both domestic and foreign.
333	Support research institutions,
336	because knowledge is an important part of wealth creation.
340	But what is the international aid community doing with Africa today?
344	They are throwing large sums of money for primary health,
347	for primary education, for food relief.
350	The entire continent has been turned into
352	a place of despair, in need of charity.
355	Ladies and gentlemen, can any one of you tell me
357	a neighbor, a friend, a relative that you know,
360	who became rich by receiving charity?
364	By holding the begging bowl and receiving alms?
367	Does any one of you in the audience have that person?
370	Does any one of you know a country that developed because of
375	the generosity and kindness of another?
378	Well, since I'm not seeing the hand,
380	it appears that what I'm stating is true.
383	(Bono: Yes!)
385	Andrew Mwenda: I can see Bono says he knows the country.
387	Which country is that?
388	(Bono: It's an Irish land.)
389	(Laughter)
391	(Bono: [unclear])
393	AM: Thank you very much. But let me tell you this.
397	External actors can only present to you an opportunity.
401	The ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage
406	depends on your internal capacity.
408	Africa has received many opportunities.
410	Many of them we haven't benefited much.
413	Why? Because we lack the internal, institutional framework
418	and policy framework that can make it possible for us
421	to benefit from our external relations. I'll give you an example.
424	Under the Cotonou Agreement,
426	formerly known as the Lome Convention,
429	African countries have been given an opportunity by Europe
432	to export goods, duty-free, to the European Union market.
437	My own country, Uganda, has a quota to export 50,000 metric tons
443	of sugar to the European Union market.
446	We haven't exported one kilogram yet.
448	We import 50,000 metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba.
457	Secondly, under the beef protocol of that agreement,
460	African countries that produce beef
462	have quotas to export beef duty-free to the European Union market.
467	None of those countries, including Africa's most successful nation, Botswana,
471	has ever met its quota.
474	So, I want to argue today that the fundamental source of Africa's
479	inability to engage the rest of the world
481	in a more productive relationship
484	is because it has a poor institutional and policy framework.
488	And all forms of intervention need support,
491	the evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth,
495	the kinds of institutions that increase productivity.
498	How do we begin to do that, and why is aid the bad instrument?
502	Aid is the bad instrument, and do you know why?
504	Because all governments across the world need money to survive.
508	Money is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order.
512	You have to pay the army and the police to show law and order.
514	And because many of our governments are quite dictatorial,
518	they need really to have the army clobber the opposition.
522	The second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers-on.
527	Why should people support their government?
528	Well, because it gives them good, paying jobs,
530	or, in many African countries, unofficial opportunities
534	to profit from corruption.
536	The fact is no government in the world,
539	with the exception of a few, like that of Idi Amin,
541	can seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule.
546	Many countries in the [unclear], they need legitimacy.
549	To get legitimacy, governments often need to deliver things like primary education,
555	primary health, roads, build hospitals and clinics.
560	If the government's fiscal survival
562	depends on it having to raise money from its own people,
566	such a government is driven by self-interest
568	to govern in a more enlightened fashion.
570	It will sit with those who create wealth.
573	Talk to them about the kind of policies and institutions
576	that are necessary for them to expand a scale and scope of business
580	so that it can collect more tax revenues from them.
583	The problem with the African continent
585	and the problem with the aid industry
586	is that it has distorted the structure of incentives
589	facing the governments in Africa.
592	The productive margin in our governments' search for revenue
595	does not lie in the domestic economy,
598	it lies with international donors.
600	Rather than sit with Ugandan --
602	(Applause) --
606	rather than sit with Ugandan entrepreneurs,
609	Ghanaian businessmen, South African enterprising leaders,
615	our governments find it more productive
618	to talk to the IMF and the World Bank.
621	I can tell you, even if you have ten Ph.Ds.,
625	you can never beat Bill Gates in understanding the computer industry.
630	Why? Because the knowledge that is required for you to understand
634	the incentives necessary to expand a business --
636	it requires that you listen to the people, the private sector actors in that industry.
642	Governments in Africa have therefore been given an opportunity,
645	by the international community, to avoid building
648	productive arrangements with your own citizens,
650	and therefore allowed to begin endless negotiations with the IMF
656	and the World Bank, and then it is the IMF and the World Bank
659	that tell them what its citizens need.
661	In the process, we, the African people, have been sidelined
665	from the policy-making, policy-orientation, and policy-
669	implementation process in our countries.
671	We have limited input, because he who pays the piper calls the tune.
675	The IMF, the World Bank, and the cartel of good intentions in the world
679	has taken over our rights as citizens,
682	and therefore what our governments are doing, because they depend on aid,
685	is to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens.
689	But I want to put a caveat on my argument,
691	and that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive.
699	Some aid may have built a hospital, fed a hungry village.
706	It may have built a road, and that road
708	may have served a very good role.
710	The mistake of the international aid industry
712	is to pick these isolated incidents of success,
716	generalize them, pour billions and trillions of dollars into them,
721	and then spread them across the whole world,
723	ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village,
728	the skills, the practices, the norms and habits
731	that allowed that small aid project to succeed --
734	like in Sauri village, in Kenya, where Jeffrey Sachs is working --
737	and therefore generalize this experience
740	as the experience of everybody.
743	Aid increases the resources available to governments,
748	and that makes working in a government the most profitable thing
752	you can have, as a person in Africa seeking a career.
755	By increasing the political attractiveness of the state,
759	especially in our ethnically fragmented societies in Africa,
763	aid tends to accentuate ethnic tensions
766	as every single ethnic group now begins struggling to enter the state
772	in order to get access to the foreign aid pie.
775	Ladies and gentlemen, the most enterprising people in Africa
780	cannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector
785	because the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business.
788	Governments are not changing it. Why?
790	Because they don't need to talk to their own citizens.
795	They talk to international donors.
797	So, the most enterprising Africans end up going to work for government,
802	and that has increased the political tensions in our countries
805	precisely because we depend on aid.
808	I also want to say that it is important for us to
812	note that, over the last 50 years, Africa has been receiving increasing aid
816	from the international community,
818	in the form of technical assistance, and financial aid,
821	and all other forms of aid.
823	Between 1960 and 2003, our continent received 600 billion dollars of aid,
833	and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in Africa.
836	Where has all the aid gone?
839	I want to use the example of my own country, called Uganda,
843	and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there.
848	In the 2006-2007 budget, expected revenue: 2.5 trillion shillings.
854	The expected foreign aid: 1.9 trillion.
857	Uganda's recurrent expenditure -- by recurrent what do I mean?
861	Hand-to-mouth is 2.6 trillion.
865	Why does the government of Uganda budget spend 110 percent
870	of its own revenue?
871	It's because there's somebody there called foreign aid, who contributes for it.
876	But this shows you that the government of Uganda
878	is not committed to spending its own revenue
882	to invest in productive investments,
884	but rather it devotes this revenue
886	to paying structure of public expenditure.
890	Public administration, which is largely patronage, takes 690 billion.
895	The military, 380 billion.
897	Agriculture, which employs 18 percent of our poverty-stricken citizens,
902	takes only 18 billion.
905	Trade and industry takes 43 billion.
909	And let me show you, what does public expenditure --
913	rather, public administration expenditure -- in Uganda constitute?
917	There you go. 70 cabinet ministers, 114 presidential advisers,
923	by the way, who never see the president, except on television.
926	(Laughter)
929	(Applause)
934	And when they see him physically, it is at public functions like this,
939	and even there, it is him who advises them.
943	(Laughter)
945	We have 81 units of local government.
948	Each local government is organized like the central government --
950	a bureaucracy, a cabinet, a parliament,
952	and so many jobs for the political hangers-on.
955	There were 56, and when our president wanted to
958	amend the constitution and remove term limits,
961	he had to create 25 new districts, and now there are 81.
965	Three hundred thirty-three members of parliament.
967	You need Wembley Stadium to host our parliament.
969	One hundred thirty-four commissions
971	and semi-autonomous government bodies,
976	all of which have directors and the cars. And the final thing,
980	this is addressed to Mr. Bono. In his work, he may help us on this.
984	A recent government of Uganda study found
986	that there are 3,000 four-wheel drive motor vehicles
990	at the Minister of Health headquarters.
992	Uganda has 961 sub-counties, each of them with a dispensary,
997	none of which has an ambulance.
999	So, the four-wheel drive vehicles at the headquarters
1002	drive the ministers, the permanent secretaries, the bureaucrats
1005	and the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects,
1008	while the poor die without ambulances and medicine.
1014	Finally, I want to say that before I came to speak here,
1018	I was told that the principle of TEDGlobal
1022	is that the good speech should be like a miniskirt.
1025	It should be short enough to arouse interest,
1027	but long enough to cover the subject.
1029	I hope I have achieved that.
1030	(Laughter)
1031	Thank you very much.
1032	(Applause)
