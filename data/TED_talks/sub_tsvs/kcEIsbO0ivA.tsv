12.874	I experienced my first coup d'état at the age of four.
17.125	Because of the coup d'état,
18.835	my family had to leave my native home of Ghana
21.962	and move to the Gambia.
24.178	As luck would have it,
25.899	six months after we arrived,
27.632	they too had a military coup.
30.703	I vividly remember being woken
30.703	up in the middle of the night
33.121	and gathering the few belongings we could
35.348	and walking for about two hours
38.297	to a safe house.
40.343	For a week, we slept under our beds
43.175	because we were worried that bullets
43.175	might fly through the window.
47.956	Then, at the age of eight,
50.138	we moved to Botswana.
52.265	This time, it was different.
54.458	There were no coups.
56.292	Everything worked. Great education.
59.335	They had such good infrastructure
59.335	that even at the time they had
62.31	a fiber-optic telephone system,
64.211	long before it had reached Western countries.
69.466	The only thing they didn't have
71.349	is that they didn't have
72.679	their own national television station,
75.329	and so I remember watching
77.22	TV from neighboring South Africa,
79.705	and watching Nelson Mandela in jail
82.326	being offered a chance to come out
84.621	if he would give up the apartheid struggle.
87.501	But he didn't. He refused to do that
88.616	until he actually achieved his objective
90.464	of freeing South Africa from apartheid.
93.676	And I remember feeling how just one good leader
97.709	could make such a big difference in Africa.
102.557	Then at the age of 12,
104.83	my family sent me to high school in Zimbabwe.
108.17	Initially, this too was amazing:
111.747	growing economy, excellent infrastructure,
116.933	and it seemed like it was a model
118.969	for economic development in Africa.
121.658	I graduated from high school in Zimbabwe
123.649	and I went off to college.
125.07	Six years later, I returned to the country.
129.161	Everything was different.
131.145	It had shattered into pieces.
134.396	Millions of people had emigrated,
137.606	the economy was in a shambles,
139.413	and it seemed all of a sudden that 30 years
141.004	of development had been wiped out.
143.889	How could a country go so bad so fast?
147.377	Most people would agree
148.99	that it's all because of leadership.
151.178	One man, President Robert Mugabe,
154.958	is almost single-handedly responsible
156.168	for having destroyed this country.
159.515	Now, all these experiences of living in different
161.244	parts of Africa growing up
163.675	did two things to me.
165.497	The first is it made me fall in love with Africa.
169.776	Everywhere I went,
171.699	I experienced the wonderful beauty of our continent
174.377	and saw the resilience and the spirit of our people,
177.534	and at the time, I realized that I wanted to dedicate
179.461	the rest of my life to making this continent great.
184.242	But I also realized that making Africa great
186.144	would require addressing this issue of leadership.
189.461	You see, all these countries I lived in,
191.632	the coups d'état
193.624	and the corruption I'd seen in Ghana and Gambia
196.683	and in Zimbabwe,
199.405	contrasted with the wonderful examples I had seen
203.858	in Botswana and in South 
203.858	Africa of good leadership.
208.412	It made me realize that Africa would rise or fall
212.495	because of the quality of our leaders.
216.174	Now, one might think, of course,
218.423	leadership matters everywhere.
221.191	But if there's one thing you take
221.191	away from my talk today, it is this:
225.421	In Africa, more than anywhere else in the world,
228.55	the difference that just one good leader can make
231.876	is much greater than anywhere 
231.876	else, and here's why.
235.435	It's because in Africa, we have weak institutions,
238.225	like the judiciary, the constitution,
240.903	civil society and so forth.
244.094	So here's a general rule of thumb that I believe in:
247.944	When societies have strong institutions,
250.711	the difference that one good
250.711	leader can make is limited,
253.973	but when you have weak institutions,
256.18	then just one good leader
257.91	can make or break that country.
260.058	Let me make it a bit more concrete.
263.366	You become the president of the United States.
266.415	"You think, ""Wow, I've arrived."
268.687	"I'm the most powerful man in the world."""
271.75	So you decide, perhaps let me pass a law.
275.436	All of a sudden, Congress taps you on the shoulder
276.978	"and says, ""No, no, no, no, no, you can't do that."""
280.111	"You say, ""Let me try this way."""
282.82	"The Senate comes and says, ""Uh-uh,"
284.273	"we don't think you can do that."""
287.101	"You say, perhaps, ""Let me print some money."
289.744	"I think the economy needs a stimulus."""
292.399	The central bank governor will think you're crazy.
293.894	You might get impeached for that.
297	But if you become the president of Zimbabwe,
299.307	"and you say, ""You know, I really like this job."
302.44	"I think I'd like to stay in it forever."""
302.44	(Laughter)
307.225	Well, you just can.
310.07	You decide you want to print money.
312.55	You call the central bank governor and you say,
314.453	"""Please double the money supply."""
316.785	"He'll say, ""Okay, yes, sir,"
318.226	"is there anything else I can do for you?"""
321.77	This is the power that African leaders have,
325.609	and this is why they make the most difference
329.127	on the continent.
331.581	The good news is that
333.626	the quality of leadership in Africa has been improving.
336.464	We've had three generations 
336.464	of leaders, in my mind.
339.206	Generation one are those who appeared
341.434	in the '50s and '60s.
342.976	These are people like Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana
345.414	and Julius Nyerere of Tanzania.
347.827	The legacy they left is that they
347.827	brought independence to Africa.
350.432	They freed us from colonialism,
351.737	and let's give them credit for that.
354.121	They were followed by generation two.
357.133	These are people that brought nothing
359.183	but havoc to Africa.
361.32	Think warfare, corruption, human rights abuses.
364.75	This is the stereotype of 
364.75	the typical African leader
366.783	that we typically think of:
368.178	Mobutu Sese Seko from Zaire,
370.184	Sani Abacha from Nigeria.
372.565	The good news is that most of
372.565	these leaders have moved on,
375.741	and they were replaced by generation three.
377.845	These are people like the late Nelson Mandela
380.161	and most of the leaders that we see in Africa today,
382.175	like Paul Kagame and so forth.
384.852	Now these leaders are by no means perfect,
387.96	but the one thing they have done is that they have
389.605	cleaned up much of the mess of generation two.
392.603	They've stopped the fighting,
394.061	and I call them the stabilizer generation.
397.16	They're much more accountable to their people,
399.11	they've improved macroeconomic policies,
402.305	and we are seeing for the first time
404.24	Africa's growing, and in 
404.24	fact it's the second fastest
406.58	growing economic region in the world.
408.425	So these leaders are by no means perfect,
410.591	but they are by and large
411.923	the best leaders we've seen in the last 50 years.
416.749	So where to from here?
419.628	I believe that the next generation
421.844	to come after this, generation four,
424.476	has a unique opportunity
427.009	to transform the continent.
429.564	Specifically, they can do two things
431.408	that previous generations have not done.
433.534	The first thing they need to do
435.716	is they need to create prosperity for the continent.
438.144	Why is prosperity so important?
440.031	Because none of the previous generations
441.714	have been able to tackle this issue of poverty.
444.394	Africa today
445.71	has the fastest growing population in the world,
448.54	but also is the poorest.
451.241	By 2030, Africa will have a
451.241	larger workforce than China,
454.918	and by 2050, it will have the
454.918	largest workforce in the world.
458.72	One billion people will need jobs in Africa,
461.252	so if we don't grow our economies fast enough,
463.626	we're sitting on a ticking time bomb,
466.073	not just for Africa but for the entire world.
469.605	Let me show you an example
471.743	of one person who is living up to this legacy
473.449	of creating prosperity: Laetitia.
476.212	Laetitia's a young woman from Kenya
479.203	who at the age of 13 had to drop out of school
481	because her family couldn't 
481	afford to pay fees for her.
483.91	So she started her own business rearing rabbits,
486.111	which happen to be a delicacy in this part of Kenya
487.71	that she's from.
489.308	This business did so well that within a year,
491.292	she was employing 15 women
493.448	and was able to generate enough income
495.425	that she was able to send herself to school,
497.146	and through these women
498.155	fund another 65 children to go to school.
500.862	The profits that she generated,
502.564	she used that to build a school,
504.149	and today she educates
508.238	And she's just turned 18.
510.128	(Applause)
516.857	Another example is Erick Rajaonary.
520.713	Erick comes from the island of Madagascar.
523.797	Now, Erick realized that agriculture
526.596	would be the key to creating jobs
528.26	in the rural areas of Madagascar,
530.319	but he also realized that fertilizer was a very
532.265	expensive input for most farmers in Madagascar.
535.596	Madagascar has these very special bats
538.623	that produce these droppings
540.207	that are very high in nutrients.
542.614	In 2006, Erick quit his job 
542.614	as a chartered accountant
545.989	and started a company to manufacture
547.958	fertilizer from the bat droppings.
551.144	Today, Erick has built a business
553.442	that generates several million dollars of revenue,
556.283	and he employs 70 people full time
559.116	and another 800 people during the season
560.994	when the bats drop their droppings the most.
563.976	Now, what I like about this story
566.539	is that it shows that opportunities 
566.539	to create prosperity
570.421	can be found almost anywhere.
572.716	Erick is known as the Batman.
574.77	(Laughter)
575.785	And who would have thought that you would have
577.752	been able to build a multimillion-dollar business
580.414	employing so many people just from bat poo?
587.444	The second thing that this generation needs to do
591.395	is to create our institutions.
593.836	They need to build these institutions such that we
595.651	are never held to ransom again
598.876	by a few individuals like Robert Mugabe.
603.33	Now, all of this sounds great,
606.472	but where are we going to
606.472	get this generation four from?
610.5	Do we just sit and hope that they emerge
612.941	by chance, or that God gives them to us?
616.705	No, I don't think so.
618.458	It's too important an issue 
618.458	for us to leave it to chance.
621.61	I believe that we need to create African institutions,
624.917	home-grown, that will identify and develop
627.628	these leaders in a systematic, practical way.
631.379	We've been doing this for the last 10 years
633.03	through the African Leadership Academy.
635.581	Laetitia is one of our young leaders.
638.262	Today, we have 700 of them 
638.262	that are being groomed
640.67	for the African continent,
642.72	and over the next 50 years,
643.795	we expect to create 6,000 of them.
646.789	But one thing has been troubling me.
649.408	We would get about 4,000 applications a year
651.5	for 100 young leaders that we could take
653.569	into this academy,
654.883	and so I saw the tremendous hunger that existed
656.944	for this leadership training that we're offering.
659.835	But we couldn't satisfy it.
662.951	So today, I'm announcing for the first time in public
666.973	an extension to this vision for
666.973	the African Leadership Academy.
671.611	We're building 25 brand new universities in Africa
676.718	that are going to cultivate this next generation
678.267	of African leaders.
680.113	Each campus will have 10,000 leaders at a time
683.975	so we'll be educating and developing
689.015	(Applause)
696.137	Over the next 50 years, this institution
698.388	will create three million transformative leaders
700.346	for the continent.
702.379	My hope is that half of them
704.62	will become the entrepreneurs that we need,
706.172	who will create these jobs that we need,
707.995	and the other half
709.502	will go into government
711.189	and the nonprofit sector,
712.388	and they will build the institutions that we need.
716.01	But they won't just learn academics.
719.4	They will also learn how to become leaders,
722.19	and they will develop their skills as entrepreneurs.
724.074	So think of this as Africa's Ivy League,
727.938	but instead of getting admitted
727.938	because of your SAT scores
731.22	or because of how much money you have
733.101	or which family you come from,
734.303	the main criteria for getting into this university
737.225	will be what is the potential that you have
739.199	for transforming Africa?
742.461	But what we're doing is 
742.461	just one group of institutions.
745.97	We cannot transform Africa by ourselves.
750.06	My hope
751.762	is that many, many other home-grown
753.9	African institutions will blossom,
757.318	and these institutions will all come together
759.02	with a common vision of developing
761.48	this next generation of African leaders,
763.363	generation four,
765.296	and they will teach them this common message:
767.76	create jobs, build our institutions.
772.54	Nelson Mandela once said,
774.79	"""Every now and then,"
776.592	a generation is called upon to be great.
779.828	"You can be that great generation."""
783.036	I believe that if we carefully identify and cultivate
786.588	the next generation of African leaders,
789.561	then this generation four that is coming up
792.336	will be the greatest generation that Africa
795.768	and indeed the entire world has ever seen.
800.18	Thank you.
802.212	(Applause)
