16.004	When I was about 16 years old
19.002	I can remember flipping through channels at home during summer vacation,
22.701	looking for a movie to watch on HBO --
25.231	"and how many of you remember ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off""?"
27.744	Oh yeah, great movie, right? -- Well, I saw Matthew Broderick on the screen, and so I thought,
32.745	"""Sweet! Ferris Bueller. I'll watch this!"""
35.457	It wasn't Ferris Bueller. And forgive me Matthew Broderick,
39.029	I know you've done other movies besides Ferris Bueller, but that's how I remember you; you're Ferris.
43.146	But you weren't doing Ferris-y things at the time; you were doing gay things at the time.
48.899	"He was in a movie called ""Torch Song Trilogy."""
52.227	"And ""Torch Song Trilogy"" was based on a play about this drag queen who essentially was looking for love."
58.973	Love and respect -- that's what the whole film was about.
62.037	And as I'm watching it, I'm realizing that they're talking about me.
67.193	Not the drag queen part -- I am not shaving my hair for anyone -- but the gay part.
72.786	The finding love and respect, the part about trying to find your place in the world.
77.999	So as I'm watching this, I see this powerful scene that brought me to tears,
84.349	and it stuck with me for the past 25 years.
87.549	And there's this quote that the main character, Arnold, tells his mother
92.658	as they're fighting about who he is and the life that he lives.
97.817	"""There's one thing more -- there's just one more thing you better understand."
103.036	I've taught myself to sew, cook, fix plumbing, build furniture,
109.072	I can even pat myself on the back when necessary,
111.929	all so I don't have to ask anyone for anything.
116.428	There's nothing I need from anyone except for love and respect,
122.107	"and anyone who can't give me those two things has no place in my life."""
126.556	I remember that scene like it was yesterday; I was 16, I was in tears, I was in the closet,
134.323	and I'm looking at these two people, Ferris Bueller and some guy I'd never seen before,
139.684	fighting for love.
143.982	When I finally got to a place in my life
148.111	where I came out and accepted who I was, and was really quite happy, to tell you the truth,
151.734	I was happily gay and I guess that's supposed to be right because gay means happy too.
155.88	I realized there were a lot of people who weren't as gay as I was --
160.209	gay being happy, not gay being attracted to the same sex.
163.427	In fact, I heard that there was a lot of hate and a lot of anger
168.471	and a lot of frustration and a lot of fear
171.081	about who I was and the gay lifestyle.
175.95	"Now, I'm sitting here trying to figure out ""the gay lifestyle,"" ""the gay lifestyle,"""
180.271	and I keep hearing this word over and over and over again: lifestyle, lifestyle, lifestyle.
184.683	I've even heard politicians say that the gay lifestyle is a greater threat
189.313	to civilization than terrorism.
192.221	That's when I got scared.
195.196	Because I'm thinking, if I'm gay and I'm doing something that's going to destroy civilization,
202.318	I need to figure out what this stuff is, and I need to stop doing it right now.
206.944	(Laughter)
209.322	So, I took a look at my life, a hard look at my life,
214.245	and I saw some things very disturbing.
218.465	(Laughter)
222.301	And I want to begin sharing these evil things that I've been doing with you,
226.055	starting with my mornings.
228.352	I drink coffee.
231.398	Not only do I drink coffee, I know other gay people who drink coffee.
237.291	I get stuck in traffic --
240.933	evil, evil traffic.
244.411	Sometimes I get stuck in lines at airports.
247.583	"I look around, and I go, ""My God, look at all these gay people!"
250.849	We're all trapped in these lines! These long lines trying to get on an airplane!
255.291	"My God, this lifestyle that I'm living is so freaking evil!"""
261.517	I clean up. This is not an actual photograph of my son's room; his is messier.
268.904	And because I have a 15-year-old, all I do is cook and cook and cook.
274.281	Any parents out there of teenagers? All we do is cook for these people --
279.222	they eat two, three, four dinners a night -- it's ridiculous!
284.026	This is the gay lifestyle.
286.674	And after I'm done cooking and cleaning and standing in line and getting stuck in traffic,
293.461	my partner and I, we get together
297.064	and we decide that we're gonna go and have some wild and crazy fun.
303.219	(Laughter)
307.043	"We're usually in bed before we find out who's eliminated on ""American Idol."""
310.395	We have to wake up and find out the next day who's still on
314.613	because we're too freaking tired to hear who stays on.
319.699	This is the super duper evil gay lifestyle.
324.069	Run for your heterosexual lives, people.
327.934	(Applause)
336.328	When my partner, Steve, and I first started dating,
340.982	he told me this story about penguins.
344.576	And I didn't know where he was going with it at first.
348.027	He was kind of a little bit nervous when he was sharing it with me, but he told me that
351.963	when a penguin finds a mate that they want to spend the rest of their life with,
356.316	they present them with a pebble -- the perfect pebble.
359.917	And then he reaches into his pocket, and he brings this out to me.
366.533	And I looked at it, and I was like, this is really cool.
370.51	"And he says, ""I want to spend the rest of my life with you."""
374.936	So I wear this whenever I have to do something that makes me a little nervous,
380.475	like, I don't know, a TEDx talk.
384.064	I wear this when I am apart from him for a long period of time.
388.05	And sometimes I just wear it just because.
391.67	How many people out there are in love? Anyone in love out there?
396.588	You might be gay.
399.764	(Laughter)
401.19	Because I, too, am in love, and apparently that's part of the gay lifestyle that I warned you about.
407.739	(Applause)
414.004	You may want to tell your spouse. Who, if they're in love, might be gay as well.
419.576	How many of you are single? Any single people out there?
423.478	You too might be gay! Because I know some gay people who are also single.
428.644	It's really scary, this gay lifestyle thing; it's super duper evil and there's no end to it!
435.389	It goes and goes and engulfs!
438.733	It's really quite silly, isn't it?
441.589	That's why I'm so happy to finally hear President Obama come out and say
448.973	that he supports --
451.035	(Applause)
454.458	that he supports marriage equality.
457.82	It's a wonderful day in our country's history; it's a wonderful day in the globe's history
462.39	to be able to have an actual sitting president say, enough of this --
467.436	first to himself, and then to the rest of the world.
471.15	It's wonderful.
473.238	But there's something that's been disturbing me since he
476.629	made that remark just a short time ago.
480.366	And that is, apparently, this is just another move by the gay activists
486.926	that's on the gay agenda.
490.407	And I'm disturbed by this because I've been openly gay now for quite some time.
496.12	I've been to all of the functions, I've been to fundraisers,
499.81	I've written about the topic, and I have yet to receive my copy of this gay agenda.
504.295	(Laughter)
505.985	I've paid my dues on time,
508.767	(Laughter)
511.316	I've marched in gay pride flags parades and the whole nine,
515.611	and I've yet to see a copy of the gay agenda.
518.952	It's very, very frustrating, and I was feeling left out, like I wasn't quite gay enough.
523.917	But then something wonderful happened: I was out shopping, as I tend to do,
529.12	and I came across a bootleg copy of the official gay agenda.
537.543	"And I said to myself, ""LZ, for so long, you have been denied this."
542.947	When you get in front of this crowd, you're gonna share the news.
547.963	You're gonna spread the gay agenda so no one else has to wonder,
551.834	what exactly is in the gay agenda?
555.355	What are these gays up to?
558.835	"What do they want?"""
561.669	So, without further ado, I will present to you, ladies and gentlemen --
567.056	now be careful, 'cause it's evil -- a copy,
571.29	the official copy, of the gay agenda.
576.723	(Music)
601.527	The gay agenda, people!
604.498	(Applause)
608.435	There it is!
610.487	Did you soak it all in? The gay agenda.
614.326	Some of you may be calling it, what,
617.577	the Constitution of the United States, is that what you call it too?
620.721	The U.S. Constitution is the gay agenda.
625.921	These gays, people like me, want to be treated like full citizens
630.826	and it's all written down in plain sight.
634.731	I was blown away when I saw it. I was like, wait, this is the gay agenda?
640.437	Why didn't you just call it the Constitution so I knew what you were talking about?
644.646	I wouldn't have been so confused; I wouldn't have been so upset.
648.334	But there it is. The gay agenda.
653.042	Run for your heterosexual lives.
658.846	Did you know that in all the states where there is no shading that
665.578	people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered
668.719	can be kicked out of their apartments
670.811	for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered?
674.947	That's the only reason that a landlord needs to have them removed,
680.115	because there's no protection from discrimination of GLBT people.
685.957	Did you know in the states where there's no shading that
691.106	you can be fired for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered?
697.292	Not based upon the quality of your work,
701.303	how long you've been there, if you stink,
705.305	just if you're gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered.
711.978	All of which flies in the face of the gay agenda,
717.308	also known as the U.S. Constitution.
721.023	Specifically, this little amendment right here:
724.695	"""No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities"
729.946	"of citizens of the United States."""
734.184	I'm looking at you, North Carolina.
737.225	But you're not looking at the U.S. Constitution.
741.822	This is the gay agenda: equality. Not special rights,
747.133	but the rights that were already written by these people --
751.309	these elitists, if you will.
753.728	Educated, well-dressed,
757.759	(Laughter)
760.447	some would dare say questionably dressed.
763.188	(Laughter)
765.967	Nonetheless, our forefathers, right?
769.749	The people that, we say, knew what they were doing when they wrote the Constitution --
773.985	the gay agenda, if you will.
777.158	All of that flies in the face of what they did.
782.481	That is the reason why I felt it was imperative that
787.992	I presented you with this copy of the gay agenda.
793.334	Because I figured if I made it funny, you wouldn't be as threatened.
798.312	I figured if I was a bit irreverent, you wouldn't find it serious.
802.871	But when you see the map, and you see our state of Michigan --
808.298	it's legal to fire someone
813.945	for being gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered,
817.839	that it's legal to remove someone from their home
822.103	because they're gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered,
826.713	then you realize that this whole conversation about marriage equality
830.701	is not about stripping someone's rights away,
834.169	it's about granting them the rights that [have] already been stated.
838.749	And we're just trying to walk in those rights that have already been stated,
843.21	that we've already agreed upon.
846.716	There are people living in fear
852.023	of losing their jobs
855.64	so they don't show anyone who they really are
860.73	right here at home. This isn't just about North Carolina;
865.535	all those states that were clear, it's legal.
871.224	If I could brag for a second,
874.448	I have a 15-year-old son from my marriage.
880.552	He has a 4.0.
883.303	He is starting a new club at school, Policy Debate.
889.742	He's a budding track star;
893.969	he has almost every single record in middle school for every event that he competed in.
900.43	He volunteers.
902.933	He prays before he eats.
906.168	I would like to think, as his father -- and he lives with me primarily --
912.363	that I had a little something to do with all of that.
916.28	I would like to think that he's a good boy,
919.188	a respectful young man. I would like to think that
923.555	I've proven to be a capable father.
927.252	But if I were to go to the state of Michigan today,
931.005	and try to adopt a young person who is in an orphanage,
935.937	I would be disqualified for only one reason:
939.536	because I'm gay.
942.893	It doesn't matter what I've already proven, what I can do with my heart.
947.696	It's because of what the state of Michigan says that I am
951.304	that I am disqualified for any sort of adoption.
957.136	And that's not just about me,
961.171	that's about so many other Michiganders, U.S. citizens,
966.074	who don't understand why what they are
971.233	is so much more significant than who they are.
976.513	This story just keeps playing over and over
981.89	and over again in our country's history.
985.381	There was a time in which, I don't know,
989.238	people who were black couldn't have the same rights.
993.267	People who happened to be women didn't have the same rights, couldn't vote.
998.582	There was a point in our history in which, if you were considered disabled,
1003.372	that an employer could just fire you, before the Americans with Disabilities Act.
1008.109	We keep doing this over and over again.
1011.463	And so here we are, 2012,
1016.047	gay agenda,
1018.376	gay lifestyle, and I'm not a good dad
1022.244	and people don't deserve to be able to protect their families
1025.754	because of what they are, not who they are.
1030.425	"So when you hear the words ""gay lifestyle"" and ""gay agenda"" in the future,"
1037.069	I encourage you to do two things:
1040.474	One, remember the U.S. Constitution, and then two,
1046.759	if you wouldn't mind looking to your left, please.
1051.882	Look to your right.
1055.038	That person next to you is a brother, is a sister.
1060.505	And they should be treated with love and respect.
1063.12	Thank you.
