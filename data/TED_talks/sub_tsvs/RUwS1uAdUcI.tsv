25.626	About 10 years ago, I took on the task
25.626	to teach global development
30.005	to Swedish undergraduate students.
32.052	That was after having spent about 20 years
34.996	together with African institutions
34.996	studying hunger in Africa,
38.53	so I was sort of expected
38.53	to know a little about the world.
42.473	And I started in our medical university,
42.473	Karolinska Institute,
46	an undergraduate course
46	called Global Health.
49.394	But when you get that opportunity,
49.394	you get a little nervous.
52.4	I thought, these students coming to us
54.299	actually have the highest grade
54.299	you can get in Swedish college systems --
57.835	so I thought, maybe they know everything
57.835	I'm going to teach them about.
61.276	So I did a pre-test when they came.
63	And one of the questions
63	from which I learned a lot was this one:
66.732	"""Which country has the highest"
66.732	"child mortality of these five pairs?"""
71.821	I put them together,
71.821	so that in each pair of country,
74.634	one has twice the child
74.634	mortality of the other.
78.453	And this means that
78.453	it's much bigger a difference
82.722	than the uncertainty of the data.
84.417	I won't put you at a test here,
84.417	but it's Turkey,
86.756	which is highest there, Poland,
86.756	Russia, Pakistan and South Africa.
91	And these were the results
91	of the Swedish students.
93.68	I did it so I got the confidence interval,
93.68	which is pretty narrow, and I got happy,
97.609	of course: a 1.8 right answer
97.609	out of five possible.
100.424	That means that there was a place
100.424	for a professor of international health
104	and for my course.
105.131	(Laughter)
106.273	But one late night,
106.273	when I was compiling the report,
110	I really realized my discovery.
112.856	I have shown that Swedish top students
115.987	know statistically significantly less
115.987	about the world than the chimpanzees.
121	(Laughter)
123	Because the chimpanzee
123	would score half right
126.254	if I gave them two bananas
126.254	with Sri Lanka and Turkey.
129.137	They would be right half of the cases.
129.137	But the students are not there.
132.583	The problem for me was not ignorance;
132.583	it was preconceived ideas.
136.822	I did also an unethical study
139.583	of the professors
139.583	of the Karolinska Institute,
141.83	that hands out
141.83	the Nobel Prize in Medicine,
144.215	and they are on par
144.215	with the chimpanzee there.
146.43	(Laughter)
149.478	This is where I realized that
149.478	there was really a need to communicate,
153.685	because the data
153.685	of what's happening in the world
156.611	and the child health
156.611	of every country is very well aware.
159.806	We did this software
159.806	which displays it like this:
162.75	every bubble here is a country.
164.555	This country over here is China.
169.596	This is India.
170.621	The size of the bubble is the population,
172.909	and on this axis here,
172.909	I put fertility rate.
176.714	Because my students, what they said
179	when they looked upon the world,
179	and I asked them,
181.833	"""What do you really"
181.833	"think about the world?"""
184.203	Well, I first discovered
184.203	that the textbook was Tintin, mainly.
187.769	(Laughter)
188.942	"And they said, ""The world"
188.942	is still 'we' and 'them.'
191.481	And 'we' is Western world
191.481	"and 'them' is Third World."""
195.328	"""And what do you mean"
195.328	"with Western world?"" I said."
197.915	"""Well, that's long life and small family,"
199.916	and Third World is short life
199.916	"and large family."""
203.058	So this is what I could display here.
205.46	I put fertility rate here:
205.46	number of children per woman:
208.86	one, two, three, four,
208.86	up to about eight children per woman.
212	We have very good data
212	since 1962 -- 1960 about --
216.369	on the size of families in all countries.
218.426	The error margin is narrow.
219.825	Here, I put life expectancy at birth,
221.696	from 30 years in some countries
221.696	up to about 70 years.
225	And 1962, there was really
225	a group of countries here
228	that was industrialized countries,
231.277	and they had small families
231.277	and long lives.
233.625	And these were the developing countries:
235.663	they had large families
235.663	and they had relatively short lives.
238.765	Now, what has happened since 1962?
238.765	We want to see the change.
242.668	Are the students right?
242.668	Is it still two types of countries?
245.629	Or have these developing countries
245.629	got smaller families and they live here?
249.212	Or have they got longer lives
249.212	and live up there?
251.711	Let's see. We stopped the world then.
253.576	This is all U.N. statistics
253.576	that have been available.
256.086	Here we go. Can you see there?
257.611	It's China there, moving against
257.611	better health there, improving there.
260.922	All the green Latin American countries
260.922	are moving towards smaller families.
264.591	Your yellow ones here
264.591	are the Arabic countries,
267.037	and they get longer life,
267.037	but not larger families.
270.962	The Africans are the green here.
270.962	They still remain here.
273.608	This is India; Indonesia
273.608	is moving on pretty fast.
276.01	(Laughter)
277.063	In the '80s here, you have Bangladesh
277.063	still among the African countries.
280.522	But now, Bangladesh --
280.522	it's a miracle that happens in the '80s:
283.499	the imams start to promote
283.499	family planning.
286	They move up into that corner.
287.863	And in the '90s, we have
287.863	the terrible HIV epidemic
291.088	that takes down the life expectancy
291.088	of the African countries
294.718	and all the rest of them
294.718	move up into the corner,
298	where we have long lives and small family,
298	and we have a completely new world.
302.938	(Applause)
313.879	(Applause ends)
315	Let me make a comparison directly
317.404	between the United States
317.404	of America and Vietnam.
322.538	America had small families and long life;
325.173	Vietnam had large families
325.173	and short lives.
328.323	And this is what happens:
330.015	the data during the war indicate
330.015	that even with all the death,
335	there was an improvement
335	of life expectancy.
337.177	By the end of the year,
337.177	the family planning started in Vietnam;
340.165	they went for smaller families.
341.756	And the United States up there
341.756	is getting for longer life,
344.671	keeping family size.
345.802	And in the '80s now,
345.802	they give up Communist planning
348.862	and they go for market economy,
350.845	and it moves faster even than social life.
352.87	And today, we have in Vietnam
355.175	the same life expectancy
355.175	and the same family size
359.87	here in Vietnam, 2003,
362.969	as in United States, 1974,
362.969	by the end of the war.
367.562	If we don't look in the data,
370.833	I think we all underestimate
370.833	the tremendous change in Asia,
374	which was in social change
374	before we saw the economical change.
378.793	Let's move over to another way here
378.793	in which we could display
383	the distribution
383	in the world of the income.
386.901	This is the world distribution
386.901	of income of people.
391.499	One dollar, 10 dollars
391.499	or 100 dollars per day.
396.071	There's no gap between rich
396.071	and poor any longer. This is a myth.
399.436	There's a little hump here.
402.119	But there are people all the way.
404	And if we look where the income ends up,
408	this is 100 percent
408	the world's annual income.
412.346	And the richest 20 percent,
414.833	they take out of that about 74 percent.
418.731	And the poorest 20 percent,
418.731	they take about two percent.
423.906	And this shows that the concept
423.906	of developing countries
426.839	is extremely doubtful.
428.218	We think about aid,
430	like these people here giving aid
430	to these people here.
433.972	But in the middle, we have
433.972	most of the world population,
436.634	and they have now
439.749	We heard it in other forms.
439.749	And who are these?
443.543	Where are the different countries?
443.543	I can show you Africa.
447.968	This is Africa.
452.81	This is OECD.
454.847	The rich country.
454.847	The country club of the U.N.
457.454	And they are over here on this side.
457.454	Quite an overlap between Africa and OECD.
462.894	And this is Latin America.
464.266	It has everything on this Earth,
464.266	from the poorest to the richest
467.645	in Latin America.
468.917	And on top of that,
468.917	we can put East Europe,
471.959	we can put East Asia,
471.959	and we put South Asia.
475.372	And how did it look like
475.372	if we go back in time,
478.526	to about 1970?
480.453	Then there was more of a hump.
484.154	And we have most who lived
484.154	in absolute poverty were Asians.
487.586	The problem in the world
487.586	was the poverty in Asia.
490.802	And if I now let the world move forward,
494	you will see that
494	while population increases,
496.774	there are hundreds of millions
496.774	in Asia getting out of poverty
499.867	and some others getting into poverty,
502.1	and this is the pattern we have today.
504.025	And the best projection
504.025	from the World Bank
506.12	is that this will happen,
507.878	and we will not have a divided world.
509.93	We'll have most people in the middle.
511.849	Of course it's a logarithmic scale here,
513.778	but our concept of economy
513.778	is growth with percent.
517.321	We look upon it as a possibility
517.321	of percentile increase.
522.393	If I change this, and take GDP per capita
522.393	instead of family income,
527.344	and I turn these individual data
531.094	into regional data
531.094	of gross domestic product,
534.16	and I take the regions down here,
536.485	the size of the bubble
536.485	is still the population.
538.748	And you have the OECD there,
538.748	and you have sub-Saharan Africa there,
541.97	and we take off the Arab states there,
544	coming both from Africa and from Asia,
544	and we put them separately,
548	and we can expand this axis,
548	and I can give it a new dimension here,
553	by adding the social values
553	there, child survival.
556.386	Now I have money on that axis,
558.574	and I have the possibility
558.574	of children to survive there.
561.291	In some countries, 99.7% of children
561.291	survive to five years of age;
565.461	others, only 70.
567.21	And here, it seems,
567.21	there is a gap between OECD,
570.309	Latin America, East Europe, East Asia,
573.578	Arab states, South Asia
573.578	and sub-Saharan Africa.
577.494	The linearity is very strong
577.494	between child survival and money.
582.396	But let me split sub-Saharan Africa.
585.444	Health is there
585.444	and better health is up there.
590.689	I can go here and I can split
590.689	sub-Saharan Africa into its countries.
595	And when it burst,
596.601	the size of its country bubble
596.601	is the size of the population.
600.271	Sierra Leone down there.
600.271	Mauritius is up there.
602.835	Mauritius was the first country
604.926	to get away with trade barriers,
604.926	and they could sell their sugar --
608.351	they could sell their textiles --
609.963	on equal terms as the people
609.963	in Europe and North America.
613.627	There's a huge difference between Africa.
613.627	And Ghana is here in the middle.
617.128	In Sierra Leone, humanitarian aid.
620	Here in Uganda, development aid.
623.95	Here, time to invest;
623.95	there, you can go for a holiday.
626.498	It's a tremendous variation within Africa
629.885	which we rarely often make
629.885	-- that it's equal everything.
633	I can split South Asia here.
633	India's the big bubble in the middle.
637	But a huge difference
637	between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.
641.486	I can split Arab states. How are they?
643.664	Same climate, same culture,
643.664	same religion -- huge difference.
647.824	Even between neighbors.
649.181	Yemen, civil war.
650.521	United Arab Emirates, money,
650.521	which was quite equally and well used.
654.888	Not as the myth is.
656.397	And that includes all the children
656.397	of the foreign workers
659.594	who are in the country.
662.284	Data is often better than you think.
662.284	Many people say data is bad.
666	There is an uncertainty margin,
666	but we can see the difference here:
669.167	Cambodia, Singapore.
670.553	The differences are much bigger
670.553	than the weakness of the data.
673.548	East Europe: Soviet economy
673.548	for a long time,
678.219	but they come out after 10 years
678.219	very, very differently.
681.455	And there is Latin America.
684.101	Today, we don't have to go to Cuba
685.846	to find a healthy country
685.846	in Latin America.
687.934	Chile will have a lower child mortality
687.934	than Cuba within some few years from now.
692.592	Here, we have high-income
692.592	countries in the OECD.
695.671	And we get the whole pattern
695.671	here of the world,
699.404	which is more or less like this.
701.474	And if we look at it, how the world looks,
706.617	in 1960, it starts to move.
710	This is Mao Tse-tung.
710	He brought health to China.
712.593	And then he died.
713.751	And then Deng Xiaoping came
713.751	and brought money to China,
716.482	and brought them
716.482	into the mainstream again.
718.56	And we have seen how countries
718.56	move in different directions like this,
722.742	so it's sort of difficult to get
722.742	an example country
728.131	which shows the pattern of the world.
730.84	But I would like to bring you back
730.84	to about here, at 1960.
738.083	I would like to compare
741.397	South Korea, which is this one,
741.397	with Brazil, which is this one.
749.187	The label went away for me here.
750.992	And I would like to compare Uganda,
750.992	which is there.
754.691	And I can run it forward, like this.
759.413	And you can see how South Korea is making
759.413	a very, very fast advancement,
766.404	whereas Brazil is much slower.
769	And if we move back again, here,
769	and we put on trails on them, like this,
775.358	you can see again
775.358	that the speed of development
779	is very, very different,
781.838	and the countries are moving more or less
781.838	in the same rate as money and health,
788.563	but it seems you can move much faster
790.461	if you are healthy first
790.461	than if you are wealthy first.
794	And to show that, you can put
794	on the way of United Arab Emirates.
798	They came from here, a mineral country.
800.88	They cached all the oil;
800.88	they got all the money;
803.229	but health cannot be bought
803.229	at the supermarket.
806.516	You have to invest in health.
806.516	You have to get kids into schooling.
809.636	You have to train health staff.
809.636	You have to educate the population.
812.803	And Sheikh Zayed did that
812.803	in a fairly good way.
815.281	In spite of falling oil prices,
815.281	he brought this country up here.
819	So we've got a much more mainstream
819	appearance of the world,
823	where all countries tend
823	to use their money
825.551	better than they used in the past.
828.755	Now, this is, more or less, if you look
828.755	at the average data of the countries --
835.751	they are like this.
837.423	Now that's dangerous, to use average data,
840.789	because there is such
840.789	a lot of difference within countries.
844.584	So if I go and look here,
844.584	we can see that Uganda today
851.027	is where South Korea was in 1960.
854	If I split Uganda, there's quite
854	a difference within Uganda.
857.69	These are the quintiles of Uganda.
859.892	The richest 20 percent
859.892	of Ugandans are there.
862.1	The poorest are down there.
863.509	If I split South Africa, it's like this.
866.409	And if I go down and look at Niger,
869.176	where there was such
869.176	a terrible famine, lastly, it's like this.
873.844	The 20 percent poorest
873.844	of Niger is out here,
876.762	and the 20 percent richest
876.762	of South Africa is there,
879.555	and yet we tend to discuss
881.597	on what solutions
881.597	there should be in Africa.
884	Everything in this world exists in Africa.
886.591	And you can't discuss
886.591	universal access to HIV [medicine]
889.89	for that quintile up here
889.89	with the same strategy as down here.
894.286	The improvement of the world
894.286	must be highly contextualized,
897.848	and it's not relevant to have it
897.848	on regional level.
901.802	We must be much more detailed.
904.07	We find that students get
904.07	very excited when they can use this.
907.42	And even more, policy makers
907.42	and the corporate sectors
911.062	would like to see
911.062	how the world is changing.
914.747	Now, why doesn't this take place?
916.459	Why are we not using the data we have?
918.973	We have data in the United Nations,
918.973	in the national statistical agencies
922.807	and in universities and other
922.807	non-governmental organizations.
926	Because the data is hidden
926	down in the databases.
928.358	And the public is there,
928.358	and the Internet is there,
931.315	but we have still not used it effectively.
933.499	All that information
933.499	we saw changing in the world
936	does not include
936	publicly-funded statistics.
939.163	There are some web pages
939.163	like this, you know,
941.341	but they take some nourishment
941.341	down from the databases,
946	but people put prices on them,
946	stupid passwords and boring statistics.
951	(Laughter)
952.413	And this won't work.
953.612	(Applause)
956.439	So what is needed? We have the databases.
958.885	It's not the new database you need.
960.686	We have wonderful design tools,
960.686	and more and more are added up here.
964.436	So we started a nonprofit venture
967.331	which, linking data to design,
967.331	we called Gapminder,
971.726	from the London Underground,
973.103	"where they warn you, ""mind the gap."""
974.904	So we thought Gapminder was appropriate.
976.868	And we started to write software
976.868	which could link the data like this.
981.248	And it wasn't that difficult.
982.819	It took some person years,
982.819	and we have produced animations.
986.394	You can take a data set and put it there.
988.751	We are liberating U.N. data,
988.751	some few U.N. organization.
993	Some countries accept that
993	their databases can go out on the world,
997.524	but what we really need is,
997.524	of course, a search function.
1000.619	A search function where we can copy
1000.619	the data up to a searchable format
1005	and get it out in the world.
1006.756	And what do we hear when we go around?
1009.151	I've done anthropology
1009.151	on the main statistical units.
1012.182	"Everyone says, ""It's impossible."
1012.182	This can't be done.
1015.326	Our information is so peculiar in detail,
1017.86	so that cannot be searched
1017.86	as others can be searched.
1020.988	We cannot give the data
1020.988	free to the students,
1023.367	"free to the entrepreneurs of the world."""
1026.256	But this is what we would
1026.256	like to see, isn't it?
1029.175	The publicly-funded data is down here.
1031.623	And we would like flowers
1031.623	to grow out on the Net.
1034.682	And one of the crucial points
1034.682	is to make them searchable,
1037.873	and then people can use the different
1037.873	design tool to animate it there.
1042.141	And I have pretty good news for you.
1044.605	I have good news that the present,
1046.823	new Head of U.N. Statistics,
1046.823	he doesn't say it's impossible.
1050	"He only says, ""We can't do it."""
1052.772	(Laughter)
1056	And that's a quite clever guy, huh?
1058	(Laughter)
1060	So we can see a lot happening
1060	in data in the coming years.
1064	We will be able to look at income
1064	distributions in completely new ways.
1068.684	This is the income distribution
1068.684	of China, 1970.
1074	This is the income distribution
1074	of the United States, 1970.
1078.82	Almost no overlap.
1081.893	And what has happened?
1083.673	What has happened is this:
1085.375	that China is growing,
1085.375	it's not so equal any longer,
1088.371	and it's appearing here,
1088.371	overlooking the United States.
1092	Almost like a ghost, isn't it?
1094.682	(Laughter)
1096	It's pretty scary.
1097.611	(Laughter)
1102.762	But I think it's very important
1102.762	to have all this information.
1106.596	We need really to see it.
1109.233	And instead of looking at this,
1112	I would like to end up by showing
1112	the Internet users per 1,000.
1117.672	In this software, we access
1117.672	about 500 variables
1120.578	from all the countries quite easily.
1123.003	It takes some time to change for this,
1126	but on the axises, you can quite easily
1126	get any variable you would like to have.
1131.879	And the thing would be
1131.879	to get up the databases free,
1136.41	to get them searchable,
1136.41	and with a second click,
1139	to get them into the graphic formats,
1139	where you can instantly understand them.
1144	Now, statisticians don't like it,
1146.126	because they say
1146.126	that this will not show the reality;
1153.118	we have to have statistical,
1153.118	analytical methods.
1156.863	But this is hypothesis-generating.
1159	I end now with the world.
1162.021	There, the Internet is coming.
1163.53	The number of Internet users
1163.53	are going up like this.
1166.037	This is the GDP per capita.
1168.03	And it's a new technology coming in,
1168.03	but then amazingly,
1171.539	how well it fits to the economy
1171.539	of the countries.
1175.282	That's why the $100 computer
1175.282	will be so important.
1178.763	But it's a nice tendency.
1180.192	It's as if the world
1180.192	is flattening off, isn't it?
1183.12	These countries are lifting more
1183.12	than the economy
1185.549	and will be very interesting
1185.549	to follow this over the year,
1188.358	as I would like you to be able to do
1188.358	with all the publicly funded data.
1191.743	Thank you very much.
1193	(Applause)
