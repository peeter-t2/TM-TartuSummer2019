12.315	I was about 10 years old
14.572	on a camping trip with my dad
16.271	in the Adirondack Mountains, a wilderness area
19.031	in the northern part of New York State.
22.026	It was a beautiful day.
23.467	The forest was sparkling.
25.469	The sun made the leaves glow like stained glass,
28.993	and if it weren't for the path we were following,
32.198	we could almost pretend we were
33.602	the first human beings to ever walk that land.
37.164	We got to our campsite.
38.815	It was a lean-to on a bluff
40.782	looking over a crystal, beautiful lake,
43.478	when I discovered a horror.
46.174	Behind the lean-to was a dump,
49.272	maybe 40 feet square
50.73	with rotting apple cores
53.043	and balled-up aluminum foil,
54.79	and a dead sneaker.
56.539	And I was astonished,
59.11	I was very angry, and I was deeply confused.
62.542	The campers who were too lazy
64.124	to take out what they had brought in,
66.082	who did they think would clean up after them?
69.927	That question stayed with me,
71.836	and it simplified a little.
73.803	Who cleans up after us?
76.179	However you configure
77.601	or wherever you place the us,
79.308	who cleans up after us in Istanbul?
81.898	Who cleans up after us in Rio
84.154	or in Paris or in London?
86.683	Here in New York,
88.255	the Department of Sanitation cleans up after us,
90.847	to the tune of 11,000 tons of garbage
93.517	and 2,000 tons of recyclables every day.
97.879	I wanted to get to know them as individuals.
100.512	I wanted to understand who takes the job.
103.358	What's it like to wear the uniform
105.877	and bear that burden?
107.531	So I started a research project with them.
110.184	I rode in the trucks and walked the routes
112.723	and interviewed people in offices and facilities
115.132	all over the city,
116.639	and I learned a lot,
118.378	but I was still an outsider.
120.727	I needed to go deeper.
122.605	So I took the job as a sanitation worker.
125.721	I didn't just ride in the trucks now. I drove the trucks.
128.368	And I operated the mechanical brooms and I plowed the snow.
131.513	It was a remarkable privilege
133.412	and an amazing education.
136.019	Everyone asks about the smell.
138.171	It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think,
141.231	and on days when it is really bad,
142.745	you get used to it rather quickly.
145.421	The weight takes a long time to get used to.
148.618	I knew people who were several years on the job
150.905	whose bodies were still adjusting to the burden
153.49	of bearing on your body
155.571	tons of trash every week.
158.55	Then there's the danger.
160.734	According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
163.206	sanitation work is one of the 10 most dangerous
165.408	occupations in the country,
167.3	and I learned why.
169.051	You're in and out of traffic all day,
170.472	and it's zooming around you.
171.433	It just wants to get past you, so it's often
173.317	the motorist is not paying attention.
175.367	That's really bad for the worker.
177.193	And then the garbage itself is full of hazards
179.353	that often fly back out of the truck
181.372	and do terrible harm.
183.453	I also learned about the relentlessness of trash.
186.268	When you step off the curb
187.579	and you see a city from behind a truck,
190.428	you come to understand that trash
192.214	is like a force of nature unto itself.
194.831	It never stops coming.
197.287	It's also like a form of respiration or circulation.
200.766	It must always be in motion.
203.811	And then there's the stigma.
205.859	You put on the uniform, and you become invisible
208.775	until someone is upset with you for whatever reason
211.079	like you've blocked traffic with your truck,
213.394	or you're taking a break too close to their home,
216.045	or you're drinking coffee in their diner,
219.159	and they will come and scorn you,
221.569	and tell you that they don't want you anywhere near them.
224.831	I find the stigma especially ironic,
227.263	because I strongly believe that sanitation workers
230.574	are the most important labor force
232.254	on the streets of the city, for three reasons.
235.278	They are the first guardians of public health.
238.06	If they're not taking away trash
240.466	efficiently and effectively every day,
242.74	it starts to spill out of its containments,
245.451	and the dangers inherent to it threaten us
249.177	in very real ways.
250.351	Diseases we've had in check for decades and centuries
253.322	burst forth again and start to harm us.
256.228	The economy needs them.
257.9	If we can't throw out the old stuff,
260.826	we have no room for the new stuff,
262.716	so then the engines of the economy
264.785	start to sputter when consumption is compromised.
267.714	I'm not advocating capitalism, I'm just pointing out their relationship.
271.778	And then there's what I call
273.766	our average, necessary quotidian velocity.
277.978	By that I simply mean
279.027	how fast we're used to moving
281.279	in the contemporary day and age.
283.411	We usually don't care for, repair, clean, carry around
288.755	our coffee cup, our shopping bag,
291.392	our bottle of water.
292.877	We use them, we throw them out, we forget about them,
295.556	because we know there's a workforce
297.336	on the other side that's going to take it all away.
300.356	So I want to suggest today a couple of ways
302.803	to think about sanitation that will perhaps help
307.317	ameliorate the stigma
309.791	and bring them into this conversation
312.022	of how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane.
317.612	Their work, I think, is kind of liturgical.
321.773	They're on the streets every day, rhythmically.
324.234	They wear a uniform in many cities.
326.295	You know when to expect them.
328.164	And their work lets us do our work.
332.087	They are almost a form of reassurance.
334.878	The flow that they maintain
336.615	keeps us safe from ourselves,
338.605	from our own dross, our cast-offs,
341.242	and that flow must be maintained always
344.5	no matter what.
346.133	On the day after September 11 in 2001,
349.857	I heard the growl of a sanitation truck on the street,
353.144	and I grabbed my infant son and I ran downstairs
355.456	and there was a man doing his paper recycling route
358.298	like he did every Wednesday.
360.48	And I tried to thank him for doing his work
362.9	on that day of all days,
365.025	but I started to cry.
367.626	And he looked at me,
369.31	and he just nodded, and he said,
372.734	"""We're going to be okay."
375.612	"We're going to be okay."""
378.253	It was a little while later that I started
379.606	my research with sanitation,
380.986	and I met that man again.
382.4	His name is Paulie, and we worked together many times,
385.317	and we became good friends.
387.14	I want to believe that Paulie was right.
389.967	We are going to be okay.
392.169	But in our effort to reconfigure
394.146	how we as a species exist on this planet,
397.187	we must include and take account of
400.482	all the costs, including the very real human cost
404.275	of the labor.
405.779	And we also would be well informed
408.58	to reach out to the people who do that work
410.798	and get their expertise
412.643	on how do we think about,
414.396	how do we create systems around sustainability
417.646	that perhaps take us from curbside recycling,
421.125	which is a remarkable success across 40 years,
423.71	across the United States and countries around the world,
426.948	and lift us up to a broader horizon
429.75	where we're looking at other forms of waste
432.636	that could be lessened
434.121	from manufacturing and industrial sources.
436.854	Municipal waste, what we think of when we talk about garbage,
440.859	accounts for three percent of the nation's waste stream.
444.857	It's a remarkable statistic.
447.244	So in the flow of your days,
449.722	in the flow of your lives,
451.248	next time you see someone whose job is
454.276	to clean up after you,
457.419	take a moment to acknowledge them.
459.908	Take a moment to say thank you.
464.5	(Applause)
