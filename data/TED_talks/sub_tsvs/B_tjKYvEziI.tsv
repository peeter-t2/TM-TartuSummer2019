13.936	Can we, as adults, grow new nerve cells?
19.15	There's still some confusion
19.15	about that question,
22.261	as this is a fairly new field of research.
25.569	For example, I was talking
25.569	to one of my colleagues, Robert,
28.952	who is an oncologist,
30.284	and he was telling me,
32.014	"""Sandrine, this is puzzling."
33.793	Some of my patients that have been told
33.793	they are cured of their cancer
38.131	"still develop symptoms of depression."""
41.52	And I responded to him,
42.839	"""Well, from my point of view"
42.839	that makes sense.
45.203	The drug you give to your patients
45.203	that stops the cancer cells multiplying
49.765	also stops the newborn neurons
49.765	"being generated in their brain."""
55.82	And then Robert looked at me
55.82	like I was crazy and said,
58.63	"""But Sandrine, these are adult patients --"
60.836	"adults do not grow new nerve cells."""
64.543	And much to his surprise, I said,
64.543	"""Well actually, we do."""
69.098	And this is a phenomenon
69.098	that we call neurogenesis.
73.948	[Neurogenesis]
75.162	Now Robert is not a neuroscientist,
78.956	and when he went to medical school
78.956	he was not taught what we know now --
83.605	that the adult brain
83.605	can generate new nerve cells.
89.217	So Robert, you know,
89.217	being the good doctor that he is,
93.611	wanted to come to my lab
95.334	to understand the topic
95.334	a little bit better.
98.881	And I took him for a tour
101.16	of one of the most exciting
101.16	parts of the brain
104.097	when it comes to neurogenesis --
106.294	and this is the hippocampus.
109.08	So this is this gray structure
109.08	in the center of the brain.
113.613	And what we've known already
113.613	for very long,
116.059	is that this is important for learning,
116.059	memory, mood and emotion.
121.343	However, what we
121.343	have learned more recently
124.414	is that this is one of the unique
124.414	structures of the adult brain
129.096	where new neurons can be generated.
132.405	And if we slice through the hippocampus
134.74	and zoom in,
136.032	what you actually see here in blue
138.857	is a newborn neuron
138.857	in an adult mouse brain.
144.769	So when it comes to the human brain --
147.848	my colleague Jonas Fris√©n
147.848	from the Karolinska Institutet,
151.404	has estimated that we produce
157.168	in the hippocampus.
159.183	You might think this is not much,
160.882	compared to the billions
160.882	of neurons we have.
163.644	But by the time we turn 50,
166.739	we will have all exchanged the neurons
166.739	we were born with in that structure
171.439	with adult-born neurons.
175.248	So why are these new neurons important
175.248	and what are their functions?
181.324	First, we know that they're important
181.324	for learning and memory.
185.046	And in the lab we have shown
186.587	that if we block the ability
186.587	of the adult brain
189.847	to produce new neurons in the hippocampus,
192.431	then we block certain memory abilities.
195.721	And this is especially new and true
195.721	for spatial recognition --
202.657	so like, how you navigate
202.657	your way in the city.
206.181	We are still learning a lot,
207.683	and neurons are not only important
207.683	for memory capacity,
210.77	but also for the quality of the memory.
213.697	And they will have been helpful
213.697	to add time to our memory
217.766	and they will help differentiate
217.766	very similar memories, like:
222.472	how do you find your bike
224.576	that you park at the station
224.576	every day in the same area,
228.116	but in a slightly different position?
232.068	And more interesting
232.068	to my colleague Robert
234.576	is the research we have been doing
234.576	on neurogenesis and depression.
240.01	So in an animal model of depression,
241.972	we have seen that we have
241.972	a lower level of neurogenesis.
246.5	And if we give antidepressants,
248.767	then we increase the production
248.767	of these newborn neurons,
252.245	and we decrease
252.245	the symptoms of depression,
255.412	establishing a clear link
255.412	between neurogenesis and depression.
261.191	But moreover, if you
261.191	just block neurogenesis,
265.524	then you block the efficacy
265.524	of the antidepressant.
269.714	So by then, Robert had understood
271.501	that very likely his patients
271.501	were suffering from depression
275.223	even after being cured of their cancer,
277.842	because the cancer drug had stopped
277.842	newborn neurons from being generated.
282.247	And it will take time
282.247	to generate new neurons
285.899	that reach normal functions.
289.78	So, collectively, now we think
289.78	we have enough evidence
294.213	to say that neurogenesis
294.213	is a target of choice
297.952	if we want to improve
297.952	memory formation or mood,
301.59	or even prevent the decline
301.59	associated with aging,
305.177	or associated with stress.
308.288	So the next question is:
310.043	can we control neurogenesis?
313.066	The answer is yes.
314.86	And we are now going to do a little quiz.
318.201	I'm going to give you a set
318.201	of behaviors and activities,
321.406	and you tell me if you think
321.406	they will increase neurogenesis
326.114	or if they will decrease neurogenesis.
328.804	Are we ready?
330.55	OK, let's go.
332.034	So what about learning?
334.521	Increasing?
335.725	Yes.
336.908	Learning will increase the production
336.908	of these new neurons.
340.718	How about stress?
343.431	Yes, stress will decrease the production
343.431	of new neurons in the hippocampus.
348.192	How about sleep deprivation?
351.375	Indeed, it will decrease neurogenesis.
354.098	How about sex?
356.414	Oh, wow!
357.59	(Laughter)
358.881	Yes, you are right, it will increase
358.881	the production of new neurons.
362.658	However, it's all about balance here.
364.834	We don't want to fall in a situation --
367.071	(Laughter)
369.023	about too much sex
369.023	leading to sleep deprivation.
371.881	(Laughter)
374.753	How about getting older?
379.645	So the neurogenesis rate
379.645	will decrease as we get older,
383.352	but it is still occurring.
386.042	And then finally, how about running?
389.912	I will let you judge that one by yourself.
393.563	So this is one of the first studies
395.383	that was carried out by one of my mentors,
395.383	Rusty Gage from the Salk Institute,
399.81	showing that the environment
399.81	can have an impact
402.108	on the production of new neurons.
404.021	And here you see a section
404.021	of the hippocampus of a mouse
408.299	that had no running wheel in its cage.
410.568	And the little black dots you see
410.568	are actually newborn neurons-to-be.
415.246	And now, you see a section
415.246	of the hippocampus of a mouse
420.408	that had a running wheel in its cage.
423.028	So you see the massive increase
424.575	of the black dots representing
424.575	the new neurons-to-be.
428.819	So activity impacts neurogenesis,
428.819	but that's not all.
433.639	What you eat will have an effect
436.31	on the production of new neurons
436.31	in the hippocampus.
439.248	So here we have a sample of diet --
442.232	of nutrients that have been shown
442.232	to have efficacy.
445.973	And I'm just going
445.973	to point a few out to you:
448.592	Calorie restriction of 20 to 30 percent
448.592	will increase neurogenesis.
454.128	Intermittent fasting --
454.128	spacing the time between your meals --
457.634	will increase neurogenesis.
459.797	Intake of flavonoids,
461.144	which are contained
461.144	in dark chocolate or blueberries,
464.171	will increase neurogenesis.
466.355	Omega-3 fatty acids,
467.885	present in fatty fish, like salmon,
470.12	will increase the production
470.12	of these new neurons.
473.502	Conversely, a diet rich
473.502	in high saturated fat
477.627	will have a negative impact
477.627	on neurogenesis.
481.232	Ethanol -- intake of alcohol --
481.232	will decrease neurogenesis.
485.981	However, not everything is lost;
488.727	resveratrol, which is
488.727	contained in red wine,
491.803	has been shown to promote
491.803	the survival of these new neurons.
495.708	So next time you are at a dinner party,
497.598	you might want to reach for this possibly
497.598	"""neurogenesis-neutral"" drink."
501.909	(Laughter)
504.066	And then finally,
504.066	let me point out the last one --
506.591	a quirky one.
507.773	So Japanese groups are fascinated
507.773	with food textures,
511.692	and they have shown that actually
511.692	soft diet impairs neurogenesis,
517.019	as opposed to food that requires
517.019	mastication -- chewing -- or crunchy food.
522.827	So all of this data,
524.644	where we need to look
524.644	at the cellular level,
527.249	has been generated using animal models.
530.47	But this diet has also been given
530.47	to human participants,
534.875	and what we could see is that
534.875	the diet modulates memory and mood
541.057	in the same direction
541.057	as it modulates neurogenesis,
544.565	such as: calorie restriction
544.565	will improve memory capacity,
549.346	whereas a high-fat diet will exacerbate
549.346	symptoms of depression --
554.469	as opposed to omega-3 fatty acids,
554.469	which increase neurogenesis,
558.357	and also help to decrease
558.357	the symptoms of depression.
563.643	So we think that the effect of diet
568.484	on mental health, on memory and mood,
572.103	is actually mediated by the production
572.103	of the new neurons in the hippocampus.
576.994	And it's not only what you eat,
578.938	but it's also the texture
578.938	of the food, when you eat it
582.027	and how much of it you eat.
585.841	On our side -- neuroscientists
585.841	interested in neurogenesis --
589.898	we need to understand better
589.898	the function of these new neurons,
593.587	and how we can control their survival
593.587	and their production.
597.896	We also need to find a way to protect
597.896	the neurogenesis of Robert's patients.
603.271	And on your side --
604.672	I leave you in charge
604.672	of your neurogenesis.
607.691	Thank you.
608.873	(Applause)
614.856	Margaret Heffernan:
614.856	Fantastic research, Sandrine.
617.212	Now, I told you you changed my life --
619.481	I now eat a lot of blueberries.
621.283	Sandrine Thuret: Very good.
623.528	MH: I'm really interested
623.528	in the running thing.
626.869	Do I have to run?
629.368	Or is it really just
629.368	about aerobic exercise,
632.034	getting oxygen to the brain?
633.663	Could it be any kind of vigorous exercise?
636.101	ST: So for the moment,
637.862	we can't really say
637.862	if it's just the running itself,
641.126	but we think that anything that indeed
641.126	will increase the production --
646.187	or moving the blood flow to the brain,
649.291	should be beneficial.
651.353	MH: So I don't have to get
651.353	a running wheel in my office?
654.004	ST: No, you don't!
655.191	MH: Oh, what a relief! That's wonderful.
657.308	Sandrine Thuret, thank you so much.
659.085	ST: Thank you, Margaret.
660.308	(Applause)
