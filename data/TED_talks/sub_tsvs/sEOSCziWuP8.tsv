13	One of my favorite cartoon characters is Snoopy.
18	I love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life.
25	So when I thought about compassion,
27	my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips,
31	where he's lying there and he says,
35	"""I really understand, and I really appreciate"
38	how one should love one's neighbor as one love's oneself.
43	"The only trouble is the people next door; I can't stand them."""
48	This, in a way, is one of the challenges
53	of how to interpret a really good idea.
57	We all, I think, believe in compassion.
60	If you look at all the world religions, all the main world religions,
64	you'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion.
69	So in Judaism, we have, from our Torah,
72	that you should love your neighbor as you love yourself.
76	And within Jewish teachings, the rabbinic teachings, we have Hillel,
81	who taught that you shouldn't do to others what you don't like being done to yourself.
86	And all the main religions have similar teachings.
91	And again, within Judaism,
93	we have a teaching about God,
96	who is called the compassionate one, Ha-rachaman.
99	After all, how could the world exist without God being compassionate?
104	And we, as taught within the Torah that we are made in the image of God,
109	so we too have to be compassionate.
113	But what does it mean? How does it impact on our everyday life?
117	Sometimes, of course, being compassionate
121	can produce feelings within us that are very difficult to control.
128	I know there are many times when I've gone and conducted a funeral,
134	or when I have been sitting with the bereaved, or with people who are dying,
140	and I am overwhelmed by the sadness, by the difficulty,
149	the challenge that is there for the family, for the person.
153	And I'm touched, so that tears come to my eyes.
158	And yet, if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings,
163	I wouldn't be doing my job --
166	because I have to actually be there for them
168	and make sure that rituals happen, that practicalities are seen to.
176	And yet, on the other hand, if I didn't feel this compassion,
181	then I feel that it would be time for me to hang up my robe
186	and give up being a rabbi.
189	And these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world.
194	Who cannot be touched by compassion
198	when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war,
205	or famine, or earthquakes, or tsunamis?
210	I know some people who say
212	"""Well, you know there's just so much out there -- I can't do anything,"
216	"I'm not going to even begin to try."""
220	And there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue.
226	There are others who feel they can't confront compassion anymore,
233	and so they turn off the television and don't watch.
238	In Judaism, though, we tend to always say, there has to be a middle way.
245	You have to, of course, be aware of the needs of others,
252	but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life
257	and be of help to people.
260	So part of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick.
269	And, of course, you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more.
272	And there's a lovely rabbinic interpretation of the beginnings of creation,
279	which says that when God created the world,
283	God thought that it would be best to create the world
289	only with the divine attribute of justice.
293	Because, after all, God is just.
295	Therefore, there should be justice throughout the world.
300	And then God looked to the future and realized,
302	if the world was created just with justice, the world couldn't exist.
307	"So, God thought, ""Nope, I'm going to create the world just with compassion."""
313	And then God looked to the future and realized that,
317	in fact, if the world were just filled with compassion,
321	there would be anarchy and chaos.
325	There had to be limits to all things.
328	The rabbis describe this as being like a king
333	who has a beautiful, fragile glass bowl.
339	If you put too much cold water in, it will shatter.
343	If you put boiling water in, it will shatter.
345	What do you have to do? Put in a mixture of the two.
350	And so God put both of these possibilities into the world.
358	There is something more though that has to be there.
362	And that is the translation of the feelings
367	that we may have about compassion
370	into the wider world, into action.
374	So, like Snoopy, we can't just lie there
377	and think great thoughts about our neighbors.
380	We actually have to do something about it.
383	And so there is also, within Judaism, this notion of love and kindness
388	"that becomes very important: ""chesed."""
393	All these three things, then, have to be melded together.
398	The idea of justice, which gives boundaries to our lives
404	and gives us a feeling of what's right about life, what's right about living,
411	what should we be doing, social justice.
415	There has to be a willingness to do good deeds,
420	but not, of course, at the expense of our own sanity.
424	You know, there's no way that you can do anything for anyone
427	if you overdo things.
429	And balancing them all in the middle is this notion of compassion,
435	which has to be there, if you like, at our very roots.
441	This idea of compassion comes to us
446	because we're made in the image of God,
449	who is ultimately the compassionate one.
453	What does this compassion entail?
455	It entails understanding the pain of the other.
460	But even more than that,
462	it means understanding one's connection to the whole of creation:
470	understanding that one is part of that creation,
474	that there is a unity that underlies all that we see,
478	all that we hear, all that we feel.
482	I call that unity God.
485	And that unity is something that connects all of creation.
490	And, of course, in the modern world, with the environmental movement,
493	we're becoming even more aware of the connectivity of things,
498	that something I do here actually does matter in Africa,
503	that if I use too much of my carbon allowance,
507	it seems to be that we are causing
509	a great lack of rain in central and eastern Africa.
516	So there is a connectivity,
518	and I have to understand that -- as part of the creation,
524	as part of me being made in the image of God.
529	And I have to understand that my needs
533	sometimes have to be sublimated to other needs.
537	"This ""18 minutes"" business, I find quite fascinating."
542	Because in Judaism, the number 18, in Hebrew letters,
547	"stands for life -- the word ""life."""
550	So, in a sense, the 18 minutes is challenging me to say,
555	"""In life, this is what's important in terms of compassion."""
559	But, something else as well:
561	actually, 18 minutes is important.
564	Because at Passover, when we have to eat unleavened bread,
570	the rabbis say, what is the difference between dough that is made into bread,
574	"and dough that is made into unleavened bread, or ""matzah""?"
577	"And they say ""It's 18 minutes."""
580	Because that's how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven.
585	"What does it mean, ""dough becomes leaven""?"
588	It means it gets filled with hot air.
591	What's matzah? What's unleavened bread? You don't get it.
595	Symbolically, what the rabbis say is that at Passover,
600	what we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air -- our pride,
606	our feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world,
610	and that everything should revolve round us.
614	So we try and get rid of those,
617	and so doing, try to get rid of the habits, the emotions, the ideas
624	that enslave us, that make our eyes closed, give us tunnel vision
630	so we don't see the needs of others --
633	and free ourselves and free ourselves from that.
637	And that too is a basis for having compassion,
642	for understanding our place in the world.
648	Now there is, in Judaism, a gorgeous story
653	of a rich man who sat in synagogue one day.
659	And, as many people do, he was dozing off during the sermon.
665	And as he was dozing off, they were reading from the book of Leviticus in the Torah.
671	And they were saying that in the ancient times in the temple in Jerusalem,
677	the priests used to have bread,
679	which they used to place into a special table in the temple in Jerusalem.
687	The man was asleep, but he heard the words bread, temple, God, and he woke up.
694	"He said, ""God wants bread. That's it. God wants bread. I know what God wants."""
699	And he rushed home. And after the Sabbath, he made 12 loaves of bread,
706	took them to the synagogue, went into the synagogue,
709	"opened the ark and said, ""God, I don't know why you want this bread, but here you are."""
713	And he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the Torah.
718	Then he went home.
721	The cleaner came into the synagogue.
724	"""Oh God, I'm in such trouble. I've got children to feed."
728	"My wife's ill. I've got no money. What can I do?"""
732	"He goes into the synagogue. ""God, will you please help me?"
736	"Ah, what a wonderful smell."""
738	He goes to the ark. He opens the ark.
740	"""There's bread! God, you've answered my plea. You've answered my question."""
745	Takes the bread and goes home.
748	Meanwhile, the rich man thinks to himself,
751	"""I'm an idiot. God wants bread?"
754	"God, the one who rules the entire universe, wants my bread?"""
759	"He rushes to the synagogue. ""I'll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it."""
762	He goes in there, and it's not there.
765	"And he says, ""God, you really did want it. You wanted my bread."
770	"Next week, with raisins."""
773	This went on for years.
775	Every week, the man would bring bread with raisins,
778	with all sorts of good things, put it into the ark.
781	"Every week, the cleaner would come. ""God you've answered my plea again."""
785	Take the bread. Take it home.
787	Went on until a new rabbi came. Rabbis always spoil things.
790	The rabbi came in and saw what was going on.
795	And he called the two of them to his office.
797	"And he said, you know, ""This is what's happening."""
800	And the rich man -- oh, dear -- crestfallen.
806	"""You mean God didn't want my bread?"""
810	"And the poor man said, ""And you mean God didn't answer my pleas?"""
817	"And the rabbi said, ""You've misunderstood me."
821	"You've misunderstood totally,"" he said."
824	"""Of course, what you are doing,"" he said to the rich man,"
828	"""is answering God's plea that we should be compassionate."
834	"And God,"" he said to the poor man, ""is answering your plea"
838	"that people should be compassionate and give."""
842	He looked at the rich man. He held the rich man's hands and said,
848	"""Don't you understand?"" He said, ""These are the hands of God."""
859	So that is the way I feel:
865	that I can only try to approach this notion of being compassionate,
872	of understanding that there is a connectivity, that there is a unity in this world;
878	that I want to try and serve that unity,
883	and that I can try and do that by understanding, I hope,
887	trying to understand something of the pain of others;
892	but understanding that there are limits, that people have to bear responsibility
895	for some of the problems that come upon them;
900	and that I have to understand that there are limits to my energy,
903	to the giving I can give.
906	I have to reevaluate them,
909	try and separate out the material things
914	and my emotions that may be enslaving me,
918	so that I can see the world clearly.
922	And then I have to try to see in what ways
927	I can make these the hands of God.
932	And so try to bring compassion to life in this world.
