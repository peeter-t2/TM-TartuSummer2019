16.25	Hi. This is my mobile phone.
23.795	A mobile phone can change your life,
31.238	and a mobile phone gives you individual freedom.
40.07	With a mobile phone,
42.438	you can shoot a crime against humanity in Syria.
47.222	With a mobile phone,
49.174	you can tweet a message
51.462	and start a protest in Egypt.
57.305	And with a mobile phone,
59.782	you can record a song, load it up to
62.703	SoundCloud and become famous.
65.184	All this is possible with your mobile phone.
69.754	I'm a child of 1984,
71.803	and I live in the city of Berlin.
75.164	Let's go back to that time, to this city.
80.844	Here you can see
82.083	how hundreds of thousands of people
84.267	stood up and protested for change.
88.506	This is autumn 1989,
91.692	and imagine that all those people standing up
96.315	and protesting for change had a
99.124	mobile phone in their pocket.
102.284	Who in the room has a mobile phone with you?
104.011	Hold it up.
105.146	Hold your phones up, hold your phones up!
108.275	Hold it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow.
111.001	That's a lot. Almost everybody today has a mobile phone.
117.394	But today I will talk about me and my mobile phone,
121.946	and how it changed my life.
125.463	And I will talk about this.
129.043	These are 35,830 lines of information.
134.146	Raw data.
136.909	And why are these informations there?
141.535	Because in the summer of 2006,
144.516	the E.U. Commission tabled a directive.
148.003	This directive [is] called Data Retention Directive.
152.668	This directive says that each phone company in Europe,
157.027	each Internet service company all over Europe,
161.524	has to store a wide range of information about the users.
166.803	Who calls whom? Who sends whom an email?
169.964	Who sends whom a text message?
172.108	And if you use your mobile phone, where you are.
176.443	All this information is stored for at least six months,
180.895	up to two years by your phone company
184.179	or your Internet service provider.
190.251	And all over Europe, people stood up and said,
193.911	"""We don't want this."""
196.418	They said, we don't want this data retention.
199.816	We want self-determination in the digital age,
203.353	and we don't want that phone companies and Internet companies
206.352	have to store all this information about us.
209.801	They were lawyers, journalists, priests,
212.484	"they all said: ""We don't want this."""
215.64	And here you can see, like 10 thousands of people
218.707	went out on the streets of Berlin and said,
221.363	"""Freedom, not fear."""
224.57	And some even said, this would be Stasi 2.0.
229.019	Stasi was the secret police in East Germany.
235.056	And I also ask myself, does it really work?
239.537	Can they really store all this information about us?
242.969	Every time I use my mobile phone?
246.614	So I asked my phone company, Deutsche Telekom,
250.37	which was at that time the largest phone company in Germany,
254.135	and I asked them, please,
255.531	send me all the information you have stored about me.
259.902	And I asked them once, and I asked them again,
262.061	and I got no real answer. It was only blah blah answers.
265.237	But then I said, I want to have this information,
268.349	because this is my life you are protocoling.
273.101	So I decided to start a lawsuit against them,
277.093	because I wanted to have this information.
280.053	But Deutsche Telekom said, no,
282.053	we will not give you this information.
284.805	So at the end, I had a settlement with them.
289.022	I'll put down the lawsuit
290.381	and they will send me all the information I ask for.
293.589	Because in the mean time,
294.806	the German Constitutional Court ruled
297.043	that the implementation of this E.U. directive
300.86	into German law was unconstitutional.
305.279	So I got this ugly brown envelope
307.397	with a C.D. inside.
309.965	And on the C.D., this was on.
313.045	Thirty-five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information.
318.406	At first I saw it, and I said, okay,
320.821	it's a huge file. Okay.
324.224	But then after a while I realized,
326.741	this is my life.
329.029	This is six months of my life,
330.813	into this file.
335.111	So I was a little bit skeptical, what should I do with it?
339.361	Because you can see where I am,
342.54	where I sleep at night,
344.748	what I am doing.
349.452	But then I said, I want to go out with this information.
354.045	I want to make them public.
355.821	Because I want to show the people what does data retention mean.
360.235	So together with Zeit Online and Open Data City, I did this.
365.499	This is a visualization of six months of my life.
369.627	You can zoom in and zoom out,
371.515	you can wind back and fast forward.
373.964	You can see every step I take.
377.382	And you can even see
379.707	how I go from Frankfurt by train
382.756	to Cologne, and how often I call in between.
386.988	All this is possible with this information.
391.721	That's a little bit scary.
397.176	But it is not only about me.
402.676	It's about all of us.
405.076	First, it's only like, I call my wife and she calls me,
409.8	and we talk to each other a couple of times.
412.471	And then there are some friends calling me,
414.933	and they call each other.
416.861	And after a while you are calling you,
418.98	and you are calling you, and you have this great
421.244	communication network.
423.668	But you can see how your people are communicating with each other,
428.149	what times they call each other, when they go to bed.
431.452	You can see all of this.
433.606	You can see the hubs, like who are the leaders in the group.
437.621	If you have access to this information,
441.101	you can see what your society is doing.
444.948	If you have access to this information,
447.573	you can control your society.
451.99	This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran.
456.966	This is a blueprint how to survey your society,
461.134	because you know who talks to whom,
463.75	who sends whom an email, all this is possible
466.631	if you have access to this information.
469.329	And this information is stored for at least six months
472.366	in Europe, up to two years.
477.353	Like I said at the beginning,
478.968	imagine that all those people on the streets of Berlin
482.401	in autumn of 1989
484.849	had a mobile phone in their pocket.
487.872	And the Stasi would have known who took part at this protest,
491.841	and if the Stasi would have known
493.528	who are the leaders behind it,
497.022	this may never have happened.
500.243	The fall of the Berlin Wall would maybe not [have been] there.
503.274	And in the aftermath, also not the fall of the Iron Curtain.
506.89	Because today, state agencies and companies
511.498	want to store as much information as they can get about us,
515.787	online and offline.
517.667	They want to have the possibility to track our lives,
521.874	and they want to store them for all time.
525.722	But self-determination and living in the digital age
530.165	is no contradiction.
532.862	But you have to fight for your self-determination today.
538.021	You have to fight for it every day.
542.048	So, when you go home,
544.81	tell your friends
546.466	that privacy is a value of the 21st century,
550.777	and it's not outdated.
553.297	When you go home, tell your representative
557.363	only because companies and state agencies have the possibility
561.842	to store certain information, they don't have to do it.
567.258	And if you don't believe me,
569.603	ask your phone company what information they store about you.
577.226	So, in the future, every time you use your mobile phone,
584.086	let it be a reminder to you
587.158	that you have to fight for self-determination in the digital age.
590.925	Thank you.
592.15	(Applause)
