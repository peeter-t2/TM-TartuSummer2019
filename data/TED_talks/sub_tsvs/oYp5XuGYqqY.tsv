12.835	I love a great mystery,
14.901	and I'm fascinated by the greatest
14.901	unsolved mystery in science,
19.313	perhaps because it's personal.
21.681	It's about who we are,
23.539	and I can't help but be curious.
26.186	The mystery is this:
28.275	What is the relationship
28.275	between your brain
31.71	and your conscious experiences,
33.221	such as your experience
33.221	of the taste of chocolate
35.891	or the feeling of velvet?
38.805	Now, this mystery is not new.
40.999	In 1868, Thomas Huxley wrote,
44.598	"""How it is that anything so remarkable"
44.598	as a state of consciousness comes about
49.892	as the result of irritating nervous tissue
53.259	is just as unaccountable
55.325	as the appearance of the genie
55.325	"when Aladdin rubbed his lamp."""
61.268	Now, Huxley knew that brain activity
63.545	and conscious experiences are correlated,
66.819	but he didn't know why.
68.978	To the science of his day,
68.978	it was a mystery.
72.299	In the years since Huxley,
74.435	science has learned a lot
74.435	about brain activity,
77.801	but the relationship
77.801	between brain activity
79.822	and conscious experiences
79.822	is still a mystery.
82.91	Why? Why have we made so little progress?
86.555	Well, some experts think
86.555	that we can't solve this problem
91.414	because we lack the necessary
91.414	concepts and intelligence.
95.883	We don't expect monkeys to solve
95.883	problems in quantum mechanics,
99.952	and as it happens, we can't expect
99.952	our species to solve this problem either.
104.527	Well, I disagree. I'm more optimistic.
107.661	I think we've simply
107.661	made a false assumption.
110.703	Once we fix it, we just
110.703	might solve this problem.
114.209	Today, I'd like tell you
114.209	what that assumption is,
116.626	why it's false, and how to fix it.
119.874	Let's begin with a question:
121.778	Do we see reality as it is?
124.866	I open my eyes
126.561	and I have an experience that I describe
126.561	as a red tomato a meter away.
132.606	As a result, I come to believe
132.606	that in reality,
135.849	there's a red tomato a meter away.
138.751	I then close my eyes, and my experience
138.751	changes to a gray field,
144.425	but is it still the case that in reality,
144.425	there's a red tomato a meter away?
150.361	I think so, but could I be wrong?
153.913	Could I be misinterpreting
153.913	the nature of my perceptions?
159.351	We have misinterpreted
159.351	our perceptions before.
162.551	We used to think the Earth is flat,
162.551	because it looks that way.
166.707	Pythagorus discovered that we were wrong.
169.586	Then we thought that the Earth
169.586	is the unmoving center of the Universe,
173.603	again because it looks that way.
176.406	Copernicus and Galileo discovered,
176.406	again, that we were wrong.
181.312	Galileo then wondered if we might
181.312	be misinterpreting our experiences
185.4	in other ways.
186.908	"He wrote: ""I think that tastes,"
186.908	odors, colors, and so on
191.917	reside in consciousness.
194.291	Hence if the living creature were removed,
194.291	"all these qualities would be annihilated."""
200.955	Now, that's a stunning claim.
203.184	Could Galileo be right?
204.995	Could we really be misinterpreting
204.995	our experiences that badly?
209.593	What does modern science
209.593	have to say about this?
212.704	Well, neuroscientists tell us
212.704	that about a third of the brain's cortex
217.928	is engaged in vision.
219.786	When you simply open your eyes
219.786	and look about this room,
223.292	billions of neurons
223.292	and trillions of synapses are engaged.
227.564	Now, this is a bit surprising,
229.172	because to the extent that
229.172	we think about vision at all,
231.813	we think of it as like a camera.
234.65	It just takes a picture
234.65	of objective reality as it is.
238.59	Now, there is a part of vision
238.59	that's like a camera:
242.29	the eye has a lens that focuses
242.29	an image on the back of the eye
246.929	where there are 130 million
246.929	photoreceptors,
250.319	so the eye is like a 130-megapixel camera.
254.219	But that doesn't explain
254.219	the billions of neurons
257.702	and trillions of synapses
257.702	that are engaged in vision.
261.324	What are these neurons up to?
263.623	Well, neuroscientists tell us
263.623	that they are creating, in real time,
267.83	all the shapes, objects, colors,
267.83	and motions that we see.
272.16	It feels like we're just taking a snapshot
272.16	of this room the way it is,
275.651	but in fact, we're constructing
275.651	everything that we see.
279.226	We don't construct
279.226	the whole world at once.
282.407	We construct what we need in the moment.
285.542	Now, there are many demonstrations
285.542	that are quite compelling
288.909	that we construct what we see.
290.72	I'll just show you two.
292.763	In this example, you see some red discs
292.763	with bits cut out of them,
298.529	but if I just rotate
298.529	the disks a little bit,
301.47	suddenly, you see a 3D cube
301.47	pop out of the screen.
306.207	Now, the screen of course is flat,
309.04	so the three-dimensional cube
309.04	that you're experiencing
311.64	must be your construction.
315.397	In this next example,
317.31	you see glowing blue bars
317.31	with pretty sharp edges
321.534	moving across a field of dots.
325.708	In fact, no dots move.
328.845	All I'm doing from frame to frame
328.845	is changing the colors of dots
333.466	from blue to black or black to blue.
335.927	But when I do this quickly,
337.761	your visual system creates
337.761	the glowing blue bars
341.476	with the sharp edges and the motion.
344.147	There are many more examples,
344.147	but these are just two
346.817	that you construct what you see.
349.58	But neuroscientists go further.
353.395	They say that we reconstruct reality.
358.496	So, when I have an experience
358.496	that I describe as a red tomato,
362.722	that experience is actually
362.722	an accurate reconstruction
366.855	of the properties of a real red tomato
368.97	that would exist
368.97	even if I weren't looking.
373.595	Now, why would neuroscientists
373.595	say that we don't just construct,
376.816	we reconstruct?
378.696	Well, the standard argument given
381.227	is usually an evolutionary one.
384.941	Those of our ancestors
384.941	who saw more accurately
387.38	had a competitive advantage compared
387.38	to those who saw less accurately,
392.233	and therefore they were more likely
392.233	to pass on their genes.
394.989	We are the offspring of those
394.989	who saw more accurately,
398.38	and so we can be confident that,
398.38	in the normal case,
401.149	our perceptions are accurate.
403.68	You see this in the standard textbooks.
407.375	One textbook says, for example,
409.369	"""Evolutionarily speaking,"
411.34	vision is useful precisely
411.34	"because it is so accurate."""
415.383	So the idea is that accurate perceptions
415.383	are fitter perceptions.
420.181	They give you a survival advantage.
422.325	Now, is this correct?
424.24	Is this the right interpretation
424.24	of evolutionary theory?
426.899	Well, let's first look at a couple
426.899	of examples in nature.
430.8	The Australian jewel beetle
433.238	is dimpled, glossy and brown.
436.349	The female is flightless.
438.694	The male flies, looking,
438.694	of course, for a hot female.
442.711	When he finds one, he alights and mates.
446.659	There's another species in the outback,
449.13	Homo sapiens.
450.464	The male of this species
450.464	has a massive brain
453.531	that he uses to hunt for cold beer.
457.889	(Laughter)
459.168	And when he finds one, he drains it,
461.542	and sometimes throws the bottle
461.542	into the outback.
464.932	Now, as it happens, these bottles
464.932	are dimpled, glossy,
469.18	and just the right shade of brown
469.18	to tickle the fancy of these beetles.
474.772	The males swarm all over
474.772	the bottles trying to mate.
479.582	They lose all interest
479.582	in the real females.
482.369	Classic case of the male
482.369	leaving the female for the bottle.
486.572	(Laughter) (Applause)
491.402	The species almost went extinct.
494.443	Australia had to change its bottles
494.443	to save its beetles.
498.752	(Laughter)
501.752	Now, the males had successfully
501.752	found females for thousands,
505.96	perhaps millions of years.
508.398	It looked like they saw reality
508.398	as it is, but apparently not.
512.832	Evolution had given them a hack.
515.689	A female is anything dimpled,
515.689	glossy and brown,
520.425	the bigger the better.
522.701	(Laughter)
524.535	Even when crawling all over the bottle,
524.535	the male couldn't discover his mistake.
529.945	Now, you might say, beetles, sure,
529.945	they're very simple creatures,
533.59	but surely not mammals.
535.448	Mammals don't rely on tricks.
538.165	Well, I won't dwell on this,
538.165	but you get the idea. (Laughter)
544.178	So this raises an important
544.178	technical question:
547.336	Does natural selection really favor
547.336	seeing reality as it is?
553.877	Fortunately, we don't have
553.877	to wave our hands and guess;
557.413	evolution is a mathematically
557.413	precise theory.
560.594	We can use the equations of evolution
560.594	to check this out.
564.147	We can have various organisms
564.147	in artificial worlds compete
568.3	and see which survive and which thrive,
570.253	which sensory systems are more fit.
573.806	A key notion in those
573.806	equations is fitness.
577.891	Consider this steak:
581.956	What does this steak do
581.956	for the fitness of an animal?
585.438	Well, for a hungry lion looking to eat,
585.438	it enhances fitness.
592.179	For a well-fed lion looking to mate,
592.179	it doesn't enhance fitness.
598.053	And for a rabbit in any state,
598.053	it doesn't enhance fitness,
601.924	so fitness does depend
601.924	on reality as it is, yes,
606.048	but also on the organism,
606.048	its state and its action.
610.236	Fitness is not the same thing
610.236	as reality as it is,
613.789	and it's fitness,
613.789	and not reality as it is,
617.272	that figures centrally
617.272	in the equations of evolution.
621.451	So, in my lab,
624.642	we have run hundreds of thousands
624.642	of evolutionary game simulations
628.417	with lots of different
628.417	randomly chosen worlds
631.482	and organisms that compete
631.482	for resources in those worlds.
635.661	Some of the organisms
635.661	see all of the reality,
639.98	others see just part of the reality,
641.869	and some see none of the reality,
643.974	only fitness.
646.24	Who wins?
648.29	Well, I hate to break it to you,
648.29	but perception of reality goes extinct.
654.255	In almost every simulation,
656.164	organisms that see none of reality
658.346	but are just tuned to fitness
660.436	drive to extinction all the organisms
660.436	that perceive reality as it is.
665.66	So the bottom line is, evolution
665.66	does not favor veridical,
670.25	or accurate perceptions.
671.906	Those perceptions of reality go extinct.
675.668	Now, this is a bit stunning.
677.688	How can it be that not seeing
677.688	the world accurately
681.37	gives us a survival advantage?
683.19	That is a bit counterintuitive.
685.303	But remember the jewel beetle.
687.138	The jewel beetle survived
687.138	for thousands, perhaps millions of years,
690.899	using simple tricks and hacks.
693.593	What the equations
693.593	of evolution are telling us
696.77	is that all organisms, including us, 
696.77	are in the same boat as the jewel beetle.
702.413	We do not see reality as it is.
704.343	We're shaped with tricks
704.343	and hacks that keep us alive.
708.615	Still,
710.635	we need some help with our intuitions.
712.702	How can not perceiving
712.702	reality as it is be useful?
717.485	Well, fortunately, we have
717.485	a very helpful metaphor:
721.154	the desktop interface on your computer.
723.986	Consider that blue icon
723.986	for a TED Talk that you're writing.
728.119	Now, the icon is blue and rectangular
732.123	and in the lower right corner
732.123	of the desktop.
735.324	Does that mean that the text file itself
735.324	in the computer is blue,
740.2	rectangular, and in the lower
740.2	right-hand corner of the computer?
743.955	Of course not.
745.278	Anyone who thought that misinterprets
745.278	the purpose of the interface.
749.987	It's not there to show you
749.987	the reality of the computer.
752.755	In fact, it's there to hide that reality.
755.68	You don't want to know about the diodes
757.555	and resistors and all
757.555	the megabytes of software.
759.805	If you had to deal with that,
759.805	you could never write your text file
762.936	or edit your photo.
764.411	So the idea is that evolution
764.411	has given us an interface
769.128	that hides reality and guides
769.128	adaptive behavior.
773.443	Space and time, as you
773.443	perceive them right now,
776.461	are your desktop.
778.635	Physical objects are simply icons
778.635	in that desktop.
784.192	There's an obvious objection.
786.413	Hoffman, if you think that train
786.413	coming down the track at 200 MPH
790.361	is just an icon of your desktop,
792.822	why don't you step in front of it?
794.947	And after you're gone,
794.947	and your theory with you,
797.24	we'll know that there's more
797.24	to that train than just an icon.
800.554	Well, I wouldn't step
800.554	in front of that train
802.597	for the same reason
804.153	that I wouldn't carelessly drag
804.153	that icon to the trash can:
808.448	not because I take the icon literally --
811.629	the file is not literally blue
811.629	or rectangular --
814.934	but I do take it seriously.
817.26	I could lose weeks of work.
819.291	Similarly, evolution has shaped us
821.845	with perceptual symbols
821.845	that are designed to keep us alive.
826.811	We'd better take them seriously.
829.276	If you see a snake, don't pick it up.
832.391	If you see a cliff, don't jump off.
835.15	They're designed to keep us safe,
835.15	and we should take them seriously.
838.726	That does not mean that we
838.726	should take them literally.
841.417	That's a logical error.
843.671	Another objection: There's
843.671	nothing really new here.
846.876	Physicists have told us for a long time
846.876	that the metal of that train looks solid
850.8	but really it's mostly empty space
850.8	with microscopic particles zipping around.
855.188	There's nothing new here.
856.676	Well, not exactly.
858.88	It's like saying, I know that
858.88	that blue icon on the desktop
862.92	is not the reality of the computer,
865.219	but if I pull out my trusty
865.219	magnifying glass and look really closely,
868.678	I see little pixels,
870.489	and that's the reality of the computer.
872.95	Well, not really -- you're still
872.95	on the desktop, and that's the point.
876.758	Those microscopic particles
876.758	are still in space and time:
879.754	they're still in the user interface.
882.145	So I'm saying something far more radical
882.145	than those physicists.
886.727	Finally, you might object,
888.2	look, we all see the train,
890.759	therefore none of us constructs the train.
893.801	But remember this example.
895.891	In this example, we all see a cube,
899.597	but the screen is flat,
901.69	so the cube that you see
901.69	is the cube that you construct.
905.736	We all see a cube
907.779	because we all, each one of us,
907.779	constructs the cube that we see.
912.638	The same is true of the train.
914.698	We all see a train because
914.698	we each see the train that we construct,
919.18	and the same is true
919.18	of all physical objects.
924.343	We're inclined to think that perception
924.343	is like a window on reality as it is.
929.396	The theory of evolution is telling us
929.396	that this is an incorrect interpretation
934.4	of our perceptions.
937.095	Instead, reality is more like a 3D desktop
940.639	that's designed to hide
940.639	the complexity of the real world
943.936	and guide adaptive behavior.
946.282	Space as you perceive it is your desktop.
949.21	Physical objects are just
949.21	the icons in that desktop.
953.456	We used to think that the Earth is flat
953.456	because it looks that way.
957.52	Then we thought that the Earth
957.52	is the unmoving center of reality
960.654	because it looks that way.
962.378	We were wrong.
963.52	We had misinterpreted our perceptions.
966.91	Now we believe that spacetime and objects
970.319	are the nature of reality as it is.
973.453	The theory of evolution is telling us
973.453	that once again, we're wrong.
977.377	We're misinterpreting the content
977.377	of our perceptual experiences.
982.416	There's something that exists
982.416	when you don't look,
984.947	but it's not spacetime
984.947	and physical objects.
988.35	It's as hard for us to let go
988.35	of spacetime and objects
991.378	as it is for the jewel beetle
991.378	to let go of its bottle.
994.861	Why? Because we're blind
994.861	to our own blindnesses.
1000.409	But we have an advantage
1000.409	over the jewel beetle:
1002.756	our science and technology.
1004.544	By peering through the lens of a telescope
1006.935	we discovered that the Earth
1006.935	is not the unmoving center of reality,
1011.571	and by peering through the lens
1011.571	of the theory of evolution
1014.449	we discovered that spacetime and objects
1016.771	are not the nature of reality.
1019.139	When I have a perceptual experience
1019.139	that I describe as a red tomato,
1023.424	I am interacting with reality,
1026.361	but that reality is not a red tomato
1026.361	and is nothing like a red tomato.
1031.571	Similarly, when I have an experience
1031.571	that I describe as a lion or a steak,
1036.972	I'm interacting with reality,
1038.82	but that reality is not a lion or a steak.
1041.978	And here's the kicker:
1043.998	When I have a perceptual experience
1043.998	that I describe as a brain, or neurons,
1048.688	I am interacting with reality,
1050.778	but that reality is not a brain or neurons
1054.307	and is nothing like a brain or neurons.
1057.805	And that reality, whatever it is,
1062.584	is the real source of cause and effect
1066.195	in the world -- not brains, not neurons.
1070.227	Brains and neurons
1070.227	have no causal powers.
1072.827	They cause none of our
1072.827	perceptual experiences,
1075.428	and none of our behavior.
1077.216	Brains and neurons are a species-specific
1077.216	set of symbols, a hack.
1082.592	What does this mean
1082.592	for the mystery of consciousness?
1085.923	Well, it opens up new possibilities.
1089.916	For instance,
1091.611	perhaps reality is some vast machine
1091.611	that causes our conscious experiences.
1098.59	I doubt this, but it's worth exploring.
1102.26	Perhaps reality is some vast,
1102.26	interacting network of conscious agents,
1107.609	simple and complex, that cause
1107.609	each other's conscious experiences.
1113.182	Actually, this isn't as crazy
1113.182	an idea as it seems,
1116.432	and I'm currently exploring it.
1118.592	But here's the point:
1120.658	Once we let go of our massively intuitive
1123.979	but massively false assumption
1123.979	about the nature of reality,
1127.903	it opens up new ways to think
1127.903	about life's greatest mystery.
1133.251	I bet that reality will end up
1133.251	turning out to be more fascinating
1137.86	and unexpected than we've ever imagined.
1141.834	The theory of evolution presents us
1141.834	with the ultimate dare:
1146.222	Dare to recognize that perception
1146.222	is not about seeing truth,
1151.364	it's about having kids.
1155.46	And by the way, even this TED
1155.46	is just in your head.
1160.2	Thank you very much.
1162.244	(Applause)
1172.786	Chris Anderson: If that's
1172.786	really you there, thank you.
1176.221	So there's so much from this.
1179.152	I mean, first of all, some people
1179.152	may just be profoundly depressed
1182.421	at the thought that,
1182.421	if evolution does not favor reality,
1187.97	I mean, doesn't that to some extent
1187.97	undermine all our endeavors here,
1191.3	all our ability to think
1191.3	that we can think the truth,
1193.984	possibly even including
1193.984	your own theory, if you go there?
1197.49	Donald Hoffman: Well, this does not
1197.49	stop us from a successful science.
1201.944	What we have is one theory
1201.944	that turned out to be false,
1204.756	that perception is like reality
1204.756	and reality is like our perceptions.
1209.215	That theory turns out to be false.
1210.9	Okay, throw that theory away.
1212.318	That doesn't stop us from now postulating
1212.318	all sorts of other theories
1215.572	about the nature of reality,
1216.93	so it's actually progress to recognize
1216.93	that one of our theories was false.
1220.535	So science continues as normal.
1220.535	There's no problem here.
1223.193	CA: So you think it's possible
1223.193	-- (Laughter) --
1225.794	This is cool, but what you're saying
1225.794	I think is it's possible that evolution
1229.904	can still get you to reason.
1232.551	DH: Yes. Now that's a very,
1232.551	very good point.
1234.864	The evolutionary game simulations that I
1234.864	showed were specifically about perception,
1239.391	and they do show that our perceptions
1239.391	have been shaped
1241.969	not to show us reality as it is,
1243.849	but that does not mean the same thing
1243.849	about our logic or mathematics.
1248.122	We haven't done these simulations,
1248.122	but my bet is that we'll find
1251.744	that there are some selection pressures
1251.744	for our logic and our mathematics
1255.366	to be at least in the direction of truth.
1257.572	I mean, if you're like me,
1257.572	math and logic is not easy.
1260.219	We don't get it all right, but at least
1260.219	the selection pressures are not
1263.57	uniformly away from true math and logic.
1265.908	So I think that we'll find that we have
1265.908	to look at each cognitive faculty
1269.228	one at a time and see
1269.228	what evolution does to it.
1271.852	What's true about perception may not
1271.852	be true about math and logic.
1275.613	CA: I mean, really what you're proposing
1275.613	is a kind of modern-day Bishop Berkeley
1279.607	interpretation of the world:
1281.998	consciousness causes matter,
1281.998	not the other way around.
1284.947	DH: Well, it's slightly
1284.947	different than Berkeley.
1287.339	Berkeley thought that, he was a deist,
1287.339	and he thought that the ultimate
1290.701	nature of reality is God
1290.701	and so forth,
1292.74	and I don't need to go
1292.74	where Berkeley's going,
1295.85	so it's quite a bit
1295.85	different from Berkeley.
1299.725	I call this conscious realism.
1299.725	It's actually a very different approach.
1303.235	CA: Don, I could literally talk with you
1303.235	for hours, and I hope to do that.
1306.825	Thanks so much for that.
1306.825	DH: Thank you. (Applause)
