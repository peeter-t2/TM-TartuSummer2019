13.268	In the northwest corner
13.268	of the United States,
16.853	right up near the Canadian border,
19.727	there's a little town
19.727	called Libby, Montana,
23.553	and it's surrounded
23.553	by pine trees and lakes
28.038	and just amazing wildlife
32.761	and these enormous trees
32.761	that scream up into the sky.
38.099	And in there is a little town
38.099	called Libby,
41.618	which I visited, which feels
41.618	kind of lonely,
45.963	a little isolated.
48.36	And in Libby, Montana,
48.36	there's a rather unusual woman
52.012	named Gayla Benefield.
54.039	She always felt a little bit
54.039	of an outsider,
56.402	although she's been there
56.402	almost all her life,
58.966	a woman of Russian extraction.
61.414	She told me when she went to school,
63.153	she was the only girl who ever chose
64.926	to do mechanical drawing.
68.174	Later in life, she got
68.174	a job going house to house
72.072	reading utility meters -- gas
72.072	meters, electricity meters.
76.182	And she was doing the work
76.182	in the middle of the day,
79.182	and one thing particularly
79.182	caught her notice, which was,
82.609	in the middle of the day
82.609	she met a lot of men
86.715	who were at home, middle
86.715	aged, late middle aged,
91.105	and a lot of them seemed
91.105	to be on oxygen tanks.
96.548	It struck her as strange.
99.311	Then, a few years later, her
99.311	father died at the age of 59,
102.922	five days before he was due
102.922	to receive his pension.
106.852	He'd been a miner.
107.94	She thought he must just have
107.94	been worn out by the work.
113.382	But then a few years
113.382	later, her mother died,
117.114	and that seemed stranger still,
120.131	because her mother came
120.131	from a long line of people
122.965	who just seemed to live forever.
126.826	In fact, Gayla's uncle
126.826	is still alive to this day,
130.395	and learning how to waltz.
132.569	It didn't make sense that Gayla's mother
136.004	should die so young.
138.458	It was an anomaly, and she kept
138.458	puzzling over anomalies.
142.702	And as she did, other ones came to mind.
144.758	She remembered, for example,
146.486	when her mother had broken a leg
146.486	and went into the hospital,
149.585	and she had a lot of x-rays,
151.36	and two of them were leg
151.36	x-rays, which made sense,
154.315	but six of them were chest
154.315	x-rays, which didn't.
159.125	She puzzled and puzzled over every piece
162.107	of her life and her parents' life,
164.483	trying to understand what she was seeing.
168.484	She thought about her town.
170.195	The town had a vermiculite mine in it.
173.183	Vermiculite was used
173.183	for soil conditioners,
176.016	to make plants grow faster and better.
179.296	Vermiculite was used to insulate lofts,
182.354	huge amounts of it put under the roof
185.001	to keep houses warm
185.001	during the long Montana winters.
188.852	Vermiculite was in the playground.
191.219	It was in the football ground.
192.672	It was in the skating rink.
195.105	What she didn't learn until she started
195.105	working this problem
198.934	is vermiculite is a very
198.934	toxic form of asbestos.
206.019	When she figured out the puzzle,
207.798	she started telling everyone she could
210.704	what had happened, what had
210.704	been done to her parents
213.371	and to the people
213.371	that she saw on oxygen tanks
216.441	at home in the afternoons.
219.602	But she was really amazed.
221.003	She thought, when everybody knows,
221.003	they'll want to do something,
224.075	but actually nobody wanted to know.
226.297	In fact, she became so annoying
228.412	as she kept insisting
228.412	on telling this story
230.849	to her neighbors, to her friends,
230.849	to other people in the community,
234.064	that eventually a bunch
234.064	of them got together
236.184	and they made a bumper sticker,
237.692	which they proudly displayed
237.692	on their cars, which said,
240.96	"""Yes, I'm from Libby, Montana,"
243.106	"and no, I don't have asbestosis."""
248.646	But Gayla didn't stop.
248.646	She kept doing research.
252.026	The advent of the Internet
252.026	definitely helped her.
255.217	She talked to anybody she could.
257.237	She argued and argued,
257.237	and finally she struck lucky
260.512	when a researcher came through town
262.712	studying the history of mines in the area,
265.146	and she told him her story,
265.146	and at first, of course,
268.288	like everyone, he didn't believe her,
270.559	but he went back to Seattle
270.559	and he did his own research
273.202	and he realized that she was right.
277.362	So now she had an ally.
281.424	Nevertheless, people still
281.424	didn't want to know.
284.014	"They said things like, ""Well,"
284.014	if it were really dangerous,
287.738	"someone would have told us."""
290.771	"""If that's really why everyone was dying,"
293.793	"the doctors would have told us."""
298.369	Some of the guys used
298.369	to very heavy jobs said,
301.745	"""I don't want to be a victim."
303.556	I can't possibly be a victim, and anyway,
305.574	"every industry has its accidents."""
312.507	But still Gayla went on,
312.507	and finally she succeeded
316.313	in getting a federal
316.313	agency to come to town
318.925	and to screen the inhabitants
318.925	of the town --
327.941	was that the town had a mortality rate
	in the United States.
337.418	That was in 2002, and even at that moment,
341.434	"no one raised their hand to say, ""Gayla,"
345.124	look in the playground where
345.124	your grandchildren are playing.
349.439	"It's lined with vermiculite."""
354.143	This wasn't ignorance.
357.21	It was willful blindness.
359.979	Willful blindness is a legal
359.979	concept which means,
363.458	if there's information that you
363.458	could know and you should know
366.435	but you somehow manage not to know,
369.862	the law deems that you're willfully blind.
372.608	You have chosen not to know.
376.383	There's a lot of willful
376.383	blindness around these days.
380.782	You can see willful blindness in banks,
383.633	when thousands of people
383.633	sold mortgages to people
386.69	who couldn't afford them.
388.398	You could see them in banks
390.056	when interest rates were manipulated
392.22	and everyone around knew
392.22	what was going on,
394.632	but everyone studiously ignored it.
397.806	You can see willful blindness
397.806	in the Catholic Church,
401.23	where decades of child abuse went ignored.
405.851	You could see willful blindness
408.146	in the run-up to the Iraq War.
412.657	Willful blindness exists
412.657	on epic scales like those,
416.296	and it also exists on very small scales,
419.191	in people's families,
419.191	in people's homes and communities,
423.119	and particularly in organizations
423.119	and institutions.
428.597	Companies that have been studied
428.597	for willful blindness
432.839	can be asked questions like,
435.122	"""Are there issues at work"
437.948	"that people are afraid to raise?"""
441.378	And when academics have
441.378	done studies like this
443.593	of corporations in the United States,
445.89	what they find is 85
445.89	percent of people say yes.
451.138	Eighty-five percent of people
451.138	know there's a problem,
454.146	but they won't say anything.
456.221	And when I duplicated
456.221	the research in Europe,
459.608	asking all the same questions,
462.27	I found exactly the same number.
465.36	Eighty-five percent.
465.36	That's a lot of silence.
469.411	It's a lot of blindness.
471.493	And what's really interesting is that when
471.493	I go to companies in Switzerland,
475.137	"they tell me, ""This"
475.137	"is a uniquely Swiss problem."""
478.555	And when I go to Germany, they say,
478.555	"""Oh yes, this is the German disease."""
482.755	And when I go to companies
482.755	in England, they say,
485.065	"""Oh, yeah, the British"
485.065	"are really bad at this."""
488.804	And the truth is, this is a human problem.
493.474	We're all, under certain
493.474	circumstances, willfully blind.
499.839	What the research shows
499.839	is that some people are blind
502.387	out of fear. They're
502.387	afraid of retaliation.
505.992	And some people are blind
505.992	because they think, well,
509.367	seeing anything is just futile.
511.785	Nothing's ever going to change.
513.641	If we make a protest, if we protest
513.641	against the Iraq War,
516.455	nothing changes, so why bother?
518.225	Better not to see this stuff at all.
522.767	And the recurrent theme
522.767	that I encounter all the time
525.765	"is people say, ""Well, you know,"
528.245	the people who do see,
528.245	they're whistleblowers,
531.745	"and we all know what happens to them."""
534.369	So there's this profound
534.369	mythology around whistleblowers
538.418	which says, first of all,
538.418	they're all crazy.
542.731	But what I've found going around the world
545.044	and talking to whistleblowers
545.044	is, actually,
548.231	they're very loyal and quite
548.231	often very conservative people.
552.986	They're hugely dedicated
552.986	to the institutions that they work for,
556.891	and the reason that they speak up,
559.198	the reason they insist on seeing,
562.08	is because they care so
562.08	much about the institution
565.577	and want to keep it healthy.
569.163	And the other thing that people often say
571.326	about whistleblowers is,
571.326	"""Well, there's no point,"
574.554	because you see what happens to them.
577.123	They are crushed.
578.437	Nobody would want to go
578.437	"through something like that."""
582.179	And yet, when I talk to whistleblowers,
585.506	the recurrent tone that I hear is pride.
590.666	I think of Joe Darby.
593.051	We all remember the photographs
593.051	of Abu Ghraib,
596.503	which so shocked the world
596.503	and showed the kind of war
600.225	that was being fought in Iraq.
602.889	But I wonder who remembers Joe Darby,
605.9	the very obedient, good soldier
609.396	who found those photographs
609.396	and handed them in.
614.159	"And he said, ""You know,"
614.159	I'm not the kind of guy
617.877	to rat people out, but some things
617.877	just cross the line.
622.103	Ignorance is bliss, they say,
624.199	but you can't put
624.199	"up with things like this."""
627.927	I talked to Steve Bolsin,
627.927	a British doctor,
630.962	who fought for five years
630.962	to draw attention
635.268	to a dangerous surgeon
635.268	who was killing babies.
640.291	And I asked him why
640.291	he did it, and he said,
642.363	"""Well, it was really my daughter"
642.363	who prompted me to do it.
646.449	She came up to me one night,
646.449	and she just said,
648.713	"'Dad, you can't let the kids die.'"""
652.142	Or I think of Cynthia Thomas,
654.893	a really loyal army
654.893	daughter and army wife,
658.878	who, as she saw her friends and relations
661.83	coming back from the Iraq
661.83	War, was so shocked
666.132	by their mental condition
668.02	and the refusal of the military
668.02	to recognize and acknowledge
672.051	post-traumatic stress syndrome
674.715	that she set up a cafe
674.715	in the middle of a military town
680.323	to give them legal, psychological
680.323	and medical assistance.
685.953	And she said to me, she said,
685.953	"""You know, Margaret,"
688.893	I always used to say I didn't
688.893	know what I wanted to be
692.686	when I grow up.
694.974	But I've found myself in this cause,
699.467	"and I'll never be the same."""
704.484	We all enjoy so many freedoms today,
707.78	hard-won freedoms:
709.736	the freedom to write and publish
709.736	without fear of censorship,
713.204	a freedom that wasn't here
713.204	the last time I came to Hungary;
716.979	a freedom to vote,
716.979	which women in particular
719.465	had to fight so hard for;
721.944	the freedom for people of different
721.944	ethnicities and cultures
724.826	and sexual orientation to live
724.826	the way that they want.
729.782	But freedom doesn't exist
729.782	if you don't use it,
734.616	and what whistleblowers do,
736.957	and what people like Gayla Benefield do
739.524	is they use the freedom that they have.
744.13	And what they're very
744.13	prepared to do is recognize
747.612	that yes, this is going to be an argument,
750.242	and yes I'm going to have a lot of rows
753.234	with my neighbors
753.234	and my colleagues and my friends,
757.223	but I'm going to become
757.223	very good at this conflict.
760.445	I'm going to take on the naysayers,
762.788	because they'll make my argument
762.788	better and stronger.
767.708	I can collaborate with my opponents
770.14	to become better at what I do.
774.622	These are people of immense persistence,
777.444	incredible patience,
777.444	and an absolute determination
782.347	not to be blind and not to be silent.
787.818	When I went to Libby, Montana,
791.011	I visited the asbestosis clinic
794.372	that Gayla Benefield brought into being,
798.293	a place where at first some of the people
801.173	who wanted help and needed
801.173	medical attention
804.415	went in the back door
807.045	because they didn't want to acknowledge
809.53	that she'd been right.
811.975	I sat in a diner, and I watched
815.148	as trucks drove up and down the highway,
819.176	carting away the earth out of gardens
823.43	and replacing it with fresh,
823.43	uncontaminated soil.
830.342	I took my 12-year-old daughter with me,
832.602	because I really wanted her to meet Gayla.
835.989	"And she said, ""Why? What's the big deal?"""
838.905	"I said, ""She's not a movie star,"
841.09	and she's not a celebrity,
841.09	and she's not an expert,
845.377	and Gayla's the first person who'd say
848.115	she's not a saint.
851.059	The really important thing about Gayla
854.199	is she is ordinary.
856.866	She's like you, and she's like me.
861.692	She had freedom,
861.692	"and she was ready to use it."""
867.655	Thank you very much.
869.154	(Applause)
