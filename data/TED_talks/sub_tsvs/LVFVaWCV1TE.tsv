15.302	I was one of the only kids in college who had a reason
18.051	to go to the P.O. box at the end of the day,
20.616	and that was mainly because my mother has never believed
22.968	in email, in Facebook, in texting or cell phones in general.
26.645	And so while other kids were BBM-ing their parents,
29.2	I was literally waiting by the mailbox
32.341	to get a letter from home to see how the weekend had gone,
35.029	which was a little frustrating when Grandma was in the hospital,
37.417	but I was just looking for some sort of scribble,
41.762	some unkempt cursive from my mother.
44.393	And so when I moved to New York City after college
46.798	and got completely sucker-punched in the face by depression,
49.758	I did the only thing I could think of at the time.
52.51	I wrote those same kinds of letters that my mother had written me
55.522	for strangers, and tucked them all throughout the city,
58.935	dozens and dozens of them. I left them everywhere,
61.778	in cafes and in libraries, at the U.N., everywhere.
65.98	I blogged about those letters and the days
68.035	when they were necessary, and I posed
70.009	a kind of crazy promise to the Internet:
72.672	that if you asked me for a hand-written letter,
75.058	I would write you one, no questions asked.
78.379	Overnight, my inbox morphed into this harbor of heartbreak --
82.455	a single mother in Sacramento, a girl being bullied
85.146	in rural Kansas, all asking me, a 22-year-old girl
89.066	who barely even knew her own coffee order,
91.712	to write them a love letter and give them a reason
94.258	to wait by the mailbox.
96.587	Well, today I fuel a global organization
99.411	that is fueled by those trips to the mailbox,
102.087	fueled by the ways in which we can harness social media
104.717	like never before to write and mail strangers letters
108.207	when they need them most, but most of all,
111.064	fueled by crates of mail like this one, my trusty mail crate,
114.36	filled with the scriptings of ordinary people,
118.6	strangers writing letters to other strangers not because
121.301	they're ever going to meet and laugh over a cup of coffee,
124.092	but because they have found one another by way of letter-writing.
127.704	But, you know, the thing that always gets me
129.218	about these letters is that most of them have been written
132.754	by people that have never known themselves loved on a piece of paper.
137.458	They could not tell you about the ink of their own love letters.
141.163	They're the ones from my generation,
143.032	the ones of us that have grown up into a world
145.898	where everything is paperless, and where some
148.981	of our best conversations have happened upon a screen.
152.043	We have learned to diary our pain onto Facebook,
154.401	and we speak swiftly in 140 characters or less.
158.691	But what if it's not about efficiency this time?
161.363	I was on the subway yesterday with this mail crate,
164.192	which is a conversation starter, let me tell you.
166.598	If you ever need one, just carry one of these. (Laughter)
168.907	And a man just stared at me, and he was like,
171.74	"""Well, why don't you use the Internet?"""
174.229	"And I thought, ""Well, sir, I am not a strategist,"
177.702	"nor am I specialist. I am merely a storyteller."""
181.468	And so I could tell you about a woman
184.149	whose husband has just come home from Afghanistan,
187.059	and she is having a hard time unearthing this thing called conversation,
190.605	and so she tucks love letters throughout the house
193.065	"as a way to say, ""Come back to me."
195.193	"Find me when you can."""
196.751	Or a girl who decides that she is going to leave love letters
199.673	around her campus in Dubuque, Iowa, only to find
202.932	her efforts ripple-effected the next day when she walks out
205.985	onto the quad and finds love letters hanging
208.12	from the trees, tucked in the bushes and the benches.
212.233	Or the man who decides that he is going to take his life,
215.266	uses Facebook as a way to say goodbye
218.405	to friends and family.
219.758	Well, tonight he sleeps safely with a stack of letters
222.328	just like this one tucked beneath his pillow,
225.545	scripted by strangers who were there for him when.
228.864	These are the kinds of stories that convinced me
231.229	that letter-writing will never again need to flip back her hair
234.075	and talk about efficiency, because she is an art form now,
237.68	all the parts of her, the signing, the scripting, the mailing,
241.073	the doodles in the margins.
243.611	The mere fact that somebody would even just sit down,
246.745	pull out a piece of paper and think about someone
248.412	the whole way through, with an intention that is so much
251.058	harder to unearth when the browser is up and the iPhone
254.288	is pinging and we've got six conversations rolling in at once,
257.815	that is an art form
259.25	"that does not fall down to the Goliath of ""get faster,"""
262.425	no matter how many social networks we might join.
265.297	We still clutch close these letters to our chest,
268.142	to the words that speak louder than loud,
270.776	when we turn pages into palettes to say the things
273.133	that we have needed to say,
274.699	the words that we have needed to write, to sisters
277.387	and brothers and even to strangers, for far too long.
280.909	Thank you. (Applause)
284.475	(Applause)
