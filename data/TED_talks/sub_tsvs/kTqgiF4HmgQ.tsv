15.518	So if someone asked you
17.339	for the three words that would sum up
20.101	your reputation, what would you say?
23.983	How would people describe your judgment,
26.378	your knowledge, your behaviors, in different situations?
30.135	Today I'd like to explore with you
32.502	why the answer to this question
34.174	will become profoundly important
36.315	in an age where reputation will be your most valuable asset.
40.912	I'd like to start by introducing you to someone
43.495	whose life has been changed by a marketplace
47.097	fueled by reputation.
49.2	Sebastian Sandys has been a bed and breakfast host
52.29	on Airbnb since 2008.
54.829	I caught up with him recently, where, over the course
57.76	of several cups of tea, he told me how
60.624	hosting guests from all over the world
63.007	has enriched his life.
64.474	More than 50 people have come to stay in the 18th-century
67.847	watchhouse he lives in with his cat, Squeak.
70.879	Now, I mention Squeak because Sebastian's first guest
75.311	happened to see a rather large mouse run across the kitchen,
79.262	and she promised that she would refrain from leaving
81.855	a bad review on one condition: he got a cat.
85.277	And so Sebastian bought Squeak to protect his reputation.
89.344	Now, as many of you know, Airbnb is a peer-to-peer
92.503	marketplace that matches people who have space to rent
96.454	with people who are looking for a place to stay
99.239	in over 192 countries.
101.926	The places being rented out are things that you might
104.616	expect, like spare rooms and holiday homes,
107.448	but part of the magic is the unique places
110.021	that you can now access: treehouses, teepees,
113.959	airplane hangars, igloos.
116.051	If you don't like the hotel, there's a castle down the road
119.51	that you can rent for 5,000 dollars a night.
122.343	It's a fantastic example of how technology
125.691	is creating a market
127.407	for things that never had a marketplace before.
129.906	Now let me show you these heat maps of Paris
133.037	to see how insanely fast it's growing.
135.595	This image here is from 2008.
138.259	The pink dots represent host properties.
141.978	Even four years ago, letting strangers stay in your home
145.971	seemed like a crazy idea.
148.463	Now the same view in 2010.
150.684	And now, 2012.
153.486	There is an Airbnb host on almost every main street in Paris.
158.625	Now, what's happening here is people are realizing
163.256	the power of technology to unlock the idling capacity
167.617	and value of all kinds of assets,
170.535	from skills to spaces to material possessions,
173.993	in ways and on a scale never possible before.
177.472	It's an economy and culture called collaborative consumption,
180.696	and, through it, people like Sebastian
183.488	are becoming micro-entrepreneurs.
185.559	They're empowered to make money and save money
188.257	from their existing assets.
190.956	But the real magic and the secret source behind
193.475	collaborative consumption marketplaces like Airbnb
196.244	isn't the inventory or the money.
198.879	It's using the power of technology to build trust
202.396	between strangers.
203.887	This side of Airbnb really hit home to Sebastian last summer
207.419	during the London riots.
208.694	He woke up around 9, and he checked his email
211.4	and he saw a bunch of messages all asking him
214.577	if he was okay.
216.099	Former guests from around the world had seen that
218.271	the riots were happening just down the street, and wanted
220.364	to check if he needed anything.
222.665	"Sebastian actually said to me, he said, ""Thirteen former guests"
225.85	"contacted me before my own mother rang."" (Laughter)"
230.013	Now, this little anecdote gets to the heart of why
234.39	I'm really passionate about collaborative consumption,
237.294	and why, after I finished my book, I decided
239.844	I'm going to try and spread this into a global movement.
243.534	Because at its core, it's about empowerment.
247.191	It's about empowering people to make meaningful connections,
251.352	connections that are enabling us to rediscover
254.274	a humanness that we've lost somewhere along the way,
257.673	by engaging in marketplaces like Airbnb, like Kickstarter,
261.993	like Etsy, that are built on personal relationships
265.226	versus empty transactions.
268.253	Now the irony is that these ideas are actually taking us back
271.581	to old market principles and collaborative behaviors
274.874	that are hard-wired in all of us.
276.586	They're just being reinvented in ways that are relevant
279.275	for the Facebook age.
280.963	We're literally beginning to realize that we have wired
284.515	our world to share, swap, rent, barter or trade
288.73	just about anything. We're sharing our cars on WhipCar,
292.464	our bikes on Spinlister, our offices on Loosecubes,
295.666	our gardens on Landshare. We're lending and borrowing
298.465	money from strangers on Zopa and Lending Club.
301.362	We are trading lessons on everything from sushi-making
303.88	to coding on Skillshare,
305.466	and we're even sharing our pets on DogVacay.
309.524	Now welcome to the wonderful world of collaborative consumption
313.979	that's enabling us to match wants with haves
317.2	in more democratic ways.
319.17	Now, collaborative consumption is creating the start
322.84	of a transformation in the way we think about supply and demand,
326.164	but it's also a part of a massive value shift underway,
330.075	where instead of consuming to keep up with the Joneses,
333.265	people are consuming to get to know the Joneses.
336.817	But the key reason why it's taking off now so fast
341.11	is because every new advancement of technology
344.144	increases the efficiency and the social glue of trust
348.218	to make sharing easier and easier.
351.603	Now, I've looked at thousands of these marketplaces,
354.571	and trust and efficiency are always the critical ingredients.
359.283	Let me give you an example.
361.275	Meet 46-year-old Chris Mok, who has, I bet,
365.693	the best job title here of SuperRabbit.
369.101	Now, four years ago, Chris lost his job, unfortunately,
373.681	as an art buyer at Macy's, and like so many people,
377.071	he struggled to find a new one during the recession.
379.923	And then he happened to stumble across a post about
383.31	TaskRabbit.
384.774	Now, the story behind TaskRabbit starts like so many
388.144	great stories with a very cute dog by the name of Kobe.
392.231	Now what happened was, in February 2008,
395.478	Leah and her husband were waiting for a cab to take them
398.142	out for dinner, when Kobe came trotting up to them
401.583	and he was salivating with saliva.
403.943	They realized they'd run out of dog food.
406.636	Kevin had to cancel the cab and trudge out in the snow.
409.88	Now, later that evening, the two self-confessed tech geeks
413.194	starting talking about how cool it would be if some kind of
416.983	eBay for errands existed.
419.023	Six months later, Leah quit her job,
421.678	and TaskRabbit was born.
424.267	At the time, she didn't realize that she was actually hitting
428.132	on a bigger idea she later called service networking.
432.72	It's essentially about how we use our online relationships
436.253	to get things done in the real world.
439.57	Now the way TaskRabbit works is, people outsource
442.179	the tasks that they want doing, name the price
444.746	they're willing to pay, and then vetted Rabbits
447.385	bid to run the errand.
448.918	Yes, there's actually a four-stage, rigorous interview process
453.411	that's designed to find the people that would make
455.199	great personal assistants and weed out the dodgy Rabbits.
458.857	Now, there's over 4,000 Rabbits across the United States
463.826	and 5,000 more on the waiting list.
466.843	Now the tasks being posted are things that you might
469.61	expect, like help with household chores
472.971	or doing some supermarket runs.
475.152	I actually learned the other day that 12 and a half thousand
477.994	loads of laundry have been cleaned and folded
481.017	through TaskRabbit.
482.729	But I love that the number one task posted,
486.541	over a hundred times a day, is something that many of us
489.818	have felt the pain of doing:
492.386	yes, assembling Ikea furniture. (Laughter) (Applause)
498.846	It's brilliant. Now, we may laugh, but Chris here
502.563	is actually making up to 5,000 dollars a month
505.163	running errands around his life.
508.314	And 70 percent of this new labor force
511.649	were previously unemployed or underemployed.
515.113	I think TaskRabbit and other examples of collaborative consumption
518.507	are like lemonade stands on steroids. They're just brilliant.
521.946	Now, when you think about it, it's amazing, right,
525.971	that over the past 20 years, we've evolved
529.17	from trusting people online to share information
532.682	to trusting to handing over our credit card information,
535.545	and now we're entering the third trust wave:
538.843	connecting trustworthy strangers to create all kinds
542.571	of people-powered marketplaces.
545.098	I actually came across this fascinating study
546.813	by the Pew Center this week that revealed
549.253	that an active Facebook user is three times as likely
552.785	as a non-Internet user to believe that most people are trustworthy.
557.82	Virtual trust will transform the way we trust one another
562.197	face to face.
563.602	Now, with all of my optimism, and I am an optimist,
566.897	comes a healthy dose of caution, or rather, an urgent need
570.617	to address some pressing, complex questions.
575.058	How to ensure our digital identities reflect our
577.644	real world identities? Do we want them to be the same?
581.107	How do we mimic the way trust is built face-to-face online?
584.787	How do we stop people who've behaved badly
586.67	in one community doing so under a different guise?
590.364	In a similar way that companies often use some kind of
593.459	credit rating to decide whether to give you a mobile plan,
596.922	or the rate of a mortgage, marketplaces that depend
599.97	on transactions between relative strangers
602.715	need some kind of device to let you know that Sebastian
605.659	and Chris are good eggs,
607.62	and that device is reputation.
610.74	Reputation is the measurement of how much a community trusts you.
615.738	Let's just take a look at Chris.
617.373	You can see that over 200 people have given him
620.666	an average rating over 4.99 out of 5.
623.905	There are over 20 pages of reviews of his work
626.185	describing him as super-friendly and fast,
628.569	and he's reached level 25, the highest level,
632.291	making him a SuperRabbit.
634.248	Now — (Laughter) -- I love that word, SuperRabbit.
637.146	And interestingly, what Chris has noted is that as his reputation
640.805	has gone up, so has his chances of winning a bid
643.964	and how much he can charge.
645.917	In other words, for SuperRabbits, reputation
648.655	has a real world value.
650.724	Now, I know what you might be thinking.
652.76	Well, this isn't anything new. Just think of power sellers
655.303	on eBay or star ratings on Amazon.
658.859	The difference today is that, with every trade we make,
662.099	comment we leave, person we flag, badge we earn,
665.499	we leave a reputation trail
667.441	of how well we can and can't be trusted.
670.987	And it's not just the breadth but the volume
673.572	of reputation data out there that is staggering.
676.21	Just consider this: Five million nights have been booked
679.514	on Airbnb in the past six months alone.
686.436	This year, two billion dollars worth of loans
689.323	will go through peer-to-peer lending platforms.
691.551	This adds up to millions of pieces of reputation data
695.905	on how well we behave or misbehave.
699.277	Now, capturing and correlating the trails of information
702.866	that we leave in different places is a massive challenge,
706.119	but one we're being asked to figure out.
708.721	What the likes of Sebastian are starting to rightfully ask
712.005	is, shouldn't they own their reputation data?
714.97	Shouldn't the reputation that he's personally invested
717.844	on building on Airbnb mean that it should travel with him
721.251	from one community to another?
723.317	What I mean by this is, say he started selling second-hand
726.029	books on Amazon. Why should he have to start from scratch?
729.785	It's a bit like when I moved from New York to Sydney.
733.46	It was ridiculous. I couldn't get a mobile phone plan
736.648	because my credit history didn't travel with me.
740.451	I was essentially a ghost in the system.
743.395	Now I'm not suggesting that the next stage
746.41	of the reputation economy is about
748.306	adding up multiple ratings into some kind of empty score.
752.675	People's lives are too complex, and who wants to do that?
756.137	I also want to be clear that this isn't about adding up
758.584	tweets and likes and friends in a clout-like fashion.
762.185	Those guys are measuring influence, not behaviors
765.465	that indicate our trustworthiness.
767.352	But the most important thing that we have to keep in mind
770.952	is that reputation is largely contextual.
774.893	Just because Sebastian is a wonderful host
777.627	does not mean that he can assemble Ikea furniture.
781.576	The big challenge is figuring out what data
784.909	makes sense to pull, because the future's
787.674	going to be driven by a smart aggregation of reputation,
791.062	not a single algorithm.
793.874	It's only a matter of time before we'll be able to perform
797.625	a Facebook- or Google-like search
800.024	and see a complete picture of someone's behaviors
802.946	in different contexts over time.
805.826	I envision a realtime stream of who has trusted you,
809.461	when, where and why, your reliability on TaskRabbit,
813.616	your cleanliness as a guest on Airbnb,
815.596	the knowledge that you display on Quora or [unclear],
819.044	they'll all live together in one place,
821.627	and this will live in some kind of reputation dashboard
825.098	that will paint a picture of your reputation capital.
829.655	Now this is a concept that I'm currently researching
832.487	and writing my next book on, and currently define
835.069	as the worth of your reputation, your intentions,
838.844	capabilities and values across communities and marketplaces.
843.225	This isn't some far-off frontier.
846.133	There are actually a wave of startups like Connect.Me
849.167	and Legit and TrustCloud that are figuring out how
852.67	you can aggregate, monitor and use your online reputation.
857.653	Now, I realize that this concept may sound a little
861.366	Big Brother to some of you, and yes, there are some
864.932	enormous transparency and privacy issues to solve,
868.332	but ultimately, if we can collect our personal reputation,
872.204	we can actually control it more, and extract
875.117	the immense value that will flow from it.
877.837	Also, more so than our credit history,
880.568	we can actually shape our reputation.
883.204	Just think of Sebastian
884.523	and how he bought the cat to influence his.
887.37	Now privacy issues aside, the other really interesting issue
891.884	I'm looking at is how do we empower digital ghosts,
894.638	people [who] for whatever reason, are not active online,
898.034	but are some of the most trustworthy people in the world?
900.798	How do we take their contributions to their jobs,
904.214	their communities and their families,
906.218	and convert that value into reputation capital?
910.126	Ultimately, when we get it right, reputation capital
913.91	could create a massive positive disruption
916.748	in who has power, trust and influence.
920.493	A three-digit score, your traditional credit history,
924.133	that only 30 percent of us actually know what it is,
926.83	will no longer be the determining factor
929.774	in how much things cost, what we can access,
933.142	and, in many instances, limit what we can do in the world.
936.062	Indeed, reputation is a currency that I believe will become
940.47	more powerful than our credit history in the 21st century.
945.717	Reputation will be the currency that says
948.414	that you can trust me.
950.598	Now the interesting thing is, reputation
953.902	is the socioeconomic lubricant
955.913	that makes collaborative consumption work and scale,
960.711	but the sources it will be generated from,
962.521	and its applications, are far bigger than this space alone.
967.006	Let me give you one example from the world of recruiting,
969.945	where reputation data will make the résumé seem
973.999	like an archaic relic of the past.
978.077	Four years ago, tech bloggers and entrepreneurs
982.1	Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood, decided to start something
987.198	called Stack Overflow.
989.742	Now, Stack Overflow is basically a platform where
993.166	experienced programmers can ask
995.684	other good programmers highly detailed technical questions
1000.197	on things like tiny pixels and chrome extensions.
1004.189	This site receives five and a half thousand questions a day,
1008.085	and 80 percent of these receive accurate answers.
1011.684	Now users earn reputation in a whole range of ways,
1014.734	but it's basically by convincing their peers
1017.367	they know what they're talking about.
1019.741	Now a few months after this site launched, the founders
1022.518	heard about something interesting,
1024.94	and it actually didn't surprise them.
1026.623	What they heard was that users were putting
1030.211	their reputation scores on the top of their résumés,
1033.655	and that recruiters were searching the platform
1036.464	to find people with unique talents.
1038.71	Now thousands of programmers today are finding
1041.617	better jobs this way, because Stack Overflow
1045.004	and the reputation dashboards provide a priceless window
1048.225	into how someone really behaves,
1050.92	and what their peers think of them.
1053.24	But the bigger principle of what's happening behind Stack Overflow,
1055.744	I think, is incredibly exciting.
1058.291	People are starting to realize that the reputation
1061.585	they generate in one place has value
1064.761	beyond the environments from which it was built.
1067.655	You know, it's very interesting.
1069.691	When you talk to super-users, whether that's SuperRabbits
1072.74	or super-people on Stack Overflow, or Uberhosts,
1077.214	they all talk about how having a high reputation
1080.261	unlocks a sense of their own power.
1083.576	On Stack Overflow, it creates a level playing field,
1086.502	enabling the people with the real talent to rise to the top.
1089.429	On Airbnb, the people often become more important
1092.581	than the spaces. On TaskRabbit,
1095.174	it gives people control of their economic activity.
1098.367	Now at the end of my tea with Sebastian, he told me how,
1101.7	on a bad, rainy day, when he hasn't had a customer
1105.341	in his bookstore, he thinks of all the people around
1108.567	the world who've said something wonderful about him,
1111.405	and what that says about him as a person.
1114.076	He's turning 50 this year, and he's convinced
1117.524	that the rich tapestry of reputation he's built on Airbnb
1121.132	will lead him to doing something interesting
1123.883	with the rest of his life.
1126.44	You know, there are only a few windows in history
1130.42	where the opportunity exists to reinvent
1133.644	part of how our socioeconomic system works.
1136.979	We're living through one of those moments.
1139.444	I believe that we are at the start of a collaborative revolution
1143.075	that will be as significant as the Industrial Revolution.
1146.855	In the 20th century, the invention of traditional credit
1150.464	transformed our consumer system, and in many ways
1153.708	controlled who had access to what.
1156.493	In the 21st century, new trust networks,
1159.508	and the reputation capital they generate, will reinvent
1162.882	the way we think about wealth, markets, power
1167.148	and personal identity, in ways we can't yet even imagine.
1171.732	Thank you very much. (Applause)
1174.699	(Applause)
