25	This meeting has really been about a digital revolution,
29	but I'd like to argue that it's done; we won.
33	We've had a digital revolution but we don't need to keep having it.
37	And I'd like to look after that,
39	to look what comes after the digital revolution.
42	So, let me start projecting forward.
44	These are some projects I'm involved in today at MIT,
48	looking what comes after computers.
51	This first one, Internet Zero, up here -- this is a web server
56	that has the cost and complexity of an RFID tag --
59	about a dollar -- that can go in every light bulb and doorknob,
62	and this is getting commercialized very quickly.
64	And what's interesting about it isn't the cost;
66	it's the way it encodes the Internet.
67	It uses a kind of a Morse code for the Internet
70	so you could send it optically; you can communicate acoustically
73	through a power line, through RF.
75	It takes the original principle of the Internet,
77	which is inter-networking computers,
79	and now lets devices inter-network.
82	That we can take the whole idea that gave birth to the Internet
85	and bring it down to the physical world in this Internet Zero,
88	this internet of devices.
90	So this is the next step from there to here,
92	and this is getting commercialized today.
95	A step after that is a project on fungible computers.
100	Fungible goods in economics can be extended and traded.
103	So, half as much grain is half as much useful,
105	but half a baby or half a computer is less useful than
108	a whole baby or a whole computer,
110	and we've been trying to make computers that work that way.
113	So, what you see in the background is a prototype.
115	This was from a thesis of a student, Bill Butow, now at Intel,
118	who wondered why, instead of making bigger and bigger chips,
121	you don't make small chips, put them in a viscous medium,
124	and pour out computing by the pound or by the square inch.
126	And that's what you see here.
128	On the left was postscript being rendered by a conventional computer;
131	on the right is postscript being rendered from the first prototype
134	we made, but there's no frame buffer, IO processor,
138	any of that stuff -- it's just this material.
140	Unlike this screen where the dots are placed carefully,
142	this is a raw material.
143	If you add twice as much of it, you have twice as much display.
146	If you shoot a gun through the middle, nothing happens.
149	If you need more resource, you just apply more computer.
153	So, that's the step after this -- of computing as a raw material.
156	That's still conventional bits, the step after that is --
159	this is an earlier prototype in the lab;
161	this is high-speed video slowed down.
163	Now, integrating chemistry in computation, where the bits are bubbles.
166	This is showing making bits, this is showing --
168	once again, slowed down so you can see it,
170	bits interacting to do logic and multiplexing and de-multiplexing.
174	So, now we can compute that the output arranges material
177	as well as information. And, ultimately, these are some slides
181	from an early project I did, computing where the bits are stored
184	quantum-mechanically in the nuclei of atoms, so
187	programs rearrange the nuclear structure of molecules.
191	All of these are in the lab pushing further and further and further,
195	not as metaphor but literally integrating bits and atoms,
198	and they lead to the following recognition.
201	We all know we've had a digital revolution, but what is that?
204	Well, Shannon took us, in the '40s, from here to here:
207	from a telephone being a speaker wire that degraded with distance
211	to the Internet. And he proved the first threshold theorem, that shows
215	if you add information and remove it to a signal,
218	you can compute perfectly with an imperfect device.
220	And that's when we got the Internet.
222	Von Neumann, in the '50s, did the same thing for computing;
225	he showed you can have an unreliable computer but restore its state
228	to make it perfect. This was the last great analog computer at MIT:
232	a differential analyzer, and the more you ran it,
234	the worse the answer got.
236	After Von Neumann, we have the Pentium, where the billionth transistor
239	is as reliable as the first one.
242	But all our fabrication is down in this lower left corner.
245	A state-of-the-art airplane factory rotating metal wax at fixed metal,
248	or you maybe melt some plastic. A 10-billion-dollar chip fab
251	uses a process a village artisan would recognize --
254	you spread stuff around and bake it.
257	All the intelligence is external to the system;
259	the materials don't have information.
261	Yesterday you heard about molecular biology,
264	which fundamentally computes to build.
266	It's an information processing system.
268	We've had digital revolutions in communication and computation,
272	but precisely the same idea, precisely the same math
275	Shannon and Von Neuman did, hasn't yet come out
277	to the physical world. So, inspired by that,
280	colleagues in this program -- the Center for Bits and Atoms
282	at MIT -- which is a group of people, like me,
285	who never understood the boundary between physical science
288	and computer science. I would even go further and say
291	computer science is one of the worst things that ever happened
293	to either computers or to science --
295	(Laughter)
296	-- because the canon -- computer science --
300	many of them are great but the canon of computer science
302	prematurely froze a model of computation
305	based on technology that was available in 1950,
308	and nature's a much more powerful computer than that.
310	So, you'll hear, tomorrow, from Saul Griffith. He was one of the
314	first students to emerge from this program.
317	We started to figure out how you can compute to fabricate.
320	This was just a proof of principle he did of tiles
323	that interact magnetically, where you write a code,
325	much like protein folding, that specifies their structure.
328	So, there's no feedback to a tool metrology;
331	the material itself codes for its structure in just the same ways
336	that protein are fabricated. So, you can, for example, do that.
340	You can do other things. That's in 2D. It works in 3D.
343	The video on the upper right -- I won't show for time --
345	shows self-replication, templating so something can make something
349	that can make something, and we're doing that now over, maybe,
352	nine orders of magnitude. Those ideas have been used to show
355	the best fidelity and direct rate DNA to make an organism,
358	in functionalizing nanoclusters with peptide tails
361	that code for their assembly -- so, much like the magnets,
363	but now on nanometer scales.
365	Laser micro-machining: essentially 3D printers that digitally fabricate
369	functional systems, all the way up to building buildings,
372	not by having blueprints,
373	but having the parts code for the structure of the building.
376	So, these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies
381	to digitize fabrication. Computers that don't control tools
385	but computers that are tools, where the output of a program
389	rearranges atoms as well as bits.
393	Now, to do that -- with your tax dollars, thank you --
396	I bought all these machines. We made a modest proposal
400	to the NSF. We wanted to be able to make anything on any length scale,
404	all in one place, because you can't segregate digital fabrication
408	by a discipline or a length scale.
410	So we put together focused nano beam writers
414	and supersonic water jet cutters and excimer micro-machining systems.
419	But I had a problem. Once I had all these machines,
422	I was spending too much time teaching students to use them.
425	So I started teaching a class, modestly called,
427	"""How To Make Almost Anything."" And that wasn't meant to be provocative;"
430	it was just for a few research students.
432	But the first day of class looked like this.
434	You know, hundreds of people came in begging,
436	all my life I've been waiting for this class; I'll do anything to do it.
439	Then they'd ask, can you teach it at MIT? It seems too useful?
442	And then the next --
443	(Laughter)
445	-- surprising thing was they weren't there to do research.
446	They were there because they wanted to make stuff.
448	They had no conventional technical background.
452	At the end of a semester they integrated their skills.
454	I'll show an old video. Kelly was a sculptor, and this is what she did
458	with her semester project.
460	(Video): Kelly: Hi, I'm Kelly and this is my scream buddy.
465	Do you ever find yourself in a situation
468	where you really have to scream, but you can't because you're at work,
473	or you're in a classroom, or you're watching your children,
476	or you're in any number of situations where it's just not permitted?
481	Well, scream buddy is a portable space for screaming.
485	When a user screams into scream buddy, their scream is silenced.
490	It is also recorded for later release where, when and how
494	the user chooses.
516	(Scream)
519	(Laughter) (Applause)
523	So, Einstein would like this.
525	This student made a web browser for parrots --
526	lets parrots surf the Net and talk to other parrots.
529	This student's made an alarm clock you wrestle
531	to prove you're awake; this is one that defends --
533	a dress that defends your personal space.
535	This isn't technology for communication;
537	it's technology to prevent it.
539	This is a device that lets you see your music.
542	This is a student who made a machine that makes machines,
545	and he made it by making Lego bricks that do the computing.
548	Just year after year -- and I finally realized
550	the students were showing the killer app of personal fabrication
554	is products for a market of one person.
556	You don't need this for what you can get in Wal-Mart;
558	you need this for what makes you unique.
559	Ken Olsen famously said, nobody needs a computer in the home.
563	But you don't use it for inventory and payroll;
565	DEC is now twice bankrupt. You don't need personal fabrication
568	in the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it.
570	You need it for what makes you unique, just like personalization.
574	So, with that, in turn, 20 million dollars today does this;
582	The students hijacked all the machines I bought to do personal fabrication.
586	Today, when you spend that much of your money,
588	there's a government requirement to do outreach, which often means
591	classes at a local school, a website -- stuff that's just not that exciting.
594	So, I made a deal with my NSF program managers that
598	instead of talking about it, I'd give people the tools.
600	This wasn't meant to be provocative or important,
602	but we put together these Fab Labs. It's about 20,000 dollars in equipment
606	that approximate both what the 20 million dollars does and where it's going.
611	A laser cutter to do press-fit assembly with 3D from 2D,
614	a sign cutter to plot in copper to do electromagnetics,
616	a micron scale,
618	numerically-controlled milling machine for precise structures,
620	programming tools for less than a dollar,
626	and microseconds on up, and they exploded around the world.
630	This wasn't scheduled, but they went from inner-city Boston
632	to Pobal in India, to Secondi-Takoradi on Ghana's coast
636	to Soshanguve in a township in South Africa,
639	to the far north of Norway, uncovering, or helping uncover,
643	for all the attention to the digital divide,
646	we would find unused computers in all these places.
650	A farmer in a rural village -- a kid needs to measure and modify
653	the world, not just get information about it on a screen.
657	That there's really a fabrication and an instrumentation divide
659	bigger than the digital divide.
662	And the way you close it is not IT for the masses but IT development for the masses.
665	So, in place after place
668	we saw this same progression: that we'd open one of these Fab Labs,
671	where we didn't -- this is too crazy to think of.
674	We didn't think this up, that we would get pulled to these places;
677	we'd open it. The first step was just empowerment.
679	You can see it in their face, just this joy of, I can do it.
682	This is a girl in inner-city Boston who had just done a high-tech
684	on-demand craft sale in the inner city community center.
688	It goes on from there to serious hands-on technical education
692	informally, out of schools. In Ghana we had set up one of these labs.
697	We designed a network sensor, and kids would show up
699	and refuse to leave the lab.
700	There was a girl who insisted we stay late at night --
703	(Video): Kids: I love the Fab Lab.
705	-- her first night in the lab because she was going to make the sensor.
708	So she insisted on fabbing the board, learning how to stuff it,
711	learning how to program it. She didn't really know
713	what she was doing or why she was doing it, but she knew
715	she just had to do it. There was something electric about it.
718	This is late at, you know, 11 o'clock at night
720	and I think I was the only person surprised when what she built
723	worked the first time.
725	And I've shown this to engineers at big companies, and they say
727	they can't do this. Any one thing she's doing, they can do better,
730	but it's distributed over many people and many sites
733	and they can't do in an afternoon
734	what this little girl in rural Ghana is doing.
753	(Video): Girl: My name is Valentina Kofi; I am eight years old.
757	I made a stacking board.
760	And, again, that was just for the joy of it.
763	Then these labs started doing serious problem solving --
766	instrumentation for agriculture in India,
768	steam turbines for energy conversion in Ghana,
770	high-gain antennas in thin client computers.
774	And then, in turn, businesses started to grow,
775	like making these antennas.
776	And finally, the lab started doing invention.
778	We're learning more from them than we're giving them.
780	I was showing my kids in a Fab Lab how to use it.
783	They invented a way to do a construction kit out of a cardboard box --
787	which, as you see up there, that's becoming a business --
789	but their design was better than Saul's design at MIT,
792	so there's now three students at MIT doing their theses on
795	scaling the work of eight-year-old children
798	because they had better designs.
799	Real invention is happening in these labs.
802	And I still kept -- so, in the last year I've been spending time with
804	heads of state and generals and tribal chiefs who all want this,
807	and I keep saying, but this isn't the real thing.
809	Wait, like, 20 years and then we'll be done.
811	And I finally got what's been going on. This is Kernigan and Ritchie
814	inventing UNIX on a PDP.
817	PDPs came between mainframes and minicomputers.
819	They were tens of thousands of dollars, hard to use,
822	but they brought computing down to work groups,
824	and everything we do today happened there.
826	These Fab Labs are the cost and complexity of a PDP.
829	The projection of digital fabrication
831	isn't a projection for the future; we are now in the PDP era.
834	We talked in hushed tones about the great discoveries then.
837	It was very chaotic, it wasn't, sort of, clear what was going on.
840	In the same sense we are now, today, in the minicomputer era
843	of digital fabrication.
845	The only problem with that is it breaks everybody's boundaries.
849	In DC, I go to every agency that wants to talk, you know;
852	in the Bay Area, I go to every organization you can think of --
854	they all want to talk about it, but it breaks
856	their organizational boundaries. In fact, it's illegal for them,
859	in many cases, to equip ordinary people to create
863	rather than consume technology.
864	And that problem is so severe that the ultimate invention
868	coming from this community surprised me:
871	it's the social engineering. That the lab in far north of Norway --
875	this is so far north its satellite dishes look at the ground
877	rather than the sky because that's where the satellites are --
881	the lab outgrew the little barn that it was in.
882	It was there because they wanted to find animals in the mountains
885	but it outgrew it, so they built this extraordinary village for the lab.
889	This isn't a university; it's not a company. It's essentially
891	a village for invention; it's a village for the outliers in society,
896	and those have been growing up around these Fab Labs
898	all around the world.
899	So this program has split into an NGO foundation,
903	a Fab Foundation to support the scaling, a micro VC fund.
907	The person who runs it nicely describes it as
908	"""machines that make machines need businesses that make businesses:"""
912	it's a cross between micro-finance and VC to do fan-out,
915	and then the research partnerships back at MIT for what's
917	making it possible.
920	So I'd like to leave you with two thoughts.
922	There's been a sea change in aid, from top-down mega-projects
927	to bottom-up, grassroots, micro-finance investing in the roots,
931	so that everybody's got that that's what works.
934	But we still look at technology as top-down mega-projects.
937	Computing, communication, energy for the rest of the planet
940	are these top-down mega-projects.
942	If this room full of heroes is just clever enough,
944	you can solve the problems.
946	The message coming from the Fab Labs is that
948	the other five billion people on the planet
950	aren't just technical sinks; they're sources.
952	The real opportunity is to harness the inventive power of the world
955	to locally design and produce solutions to local problems.
959	I thought that's the projection 20 years hence into the future,
962	but it's where we are today.
964	It breaks every organizational boundary we can think of.
966	The hardest thing at this point is the social engineering
969	and the organizational engineering, but it's here today.
972	And, finally, any talk like this on the future of computing
974	is required to show Moore's law, but my favorite version --
978	this is Gordon Moore's original one from his original paper --
983	and what's happened is, year after year after year,
985	we've scaled and we've scaled and we've scaled
986	and we've scaled, and we've scaled and we've scaled,
990	and we've scaled and we've scaled,
991	and there's this looming bug of what's going to happen
993	at the end of Moore's law; this ultimate bug is coming.
997	But we're coming to appreciate, is the transition from 2D to 3D,
1002	from programming bits to programming atoms,
1005	turns the ends of Moore's law scaling from the ultimate bug
1007	to the ultimate feature.
1009	So, we're just at the edge of this digital revolution in fabrication,
1013	where the output of computation programs the physical world.
1016	So, together, these two projects answer questions
1019	I hadn't asked carefully. The class at MIT shows the killer app
1023	for personal fabrication in the developed world
1025	is technology for a market of one: personal expression in technology
1029	that touches a passion unlike anything I've seen in technology
1032	for a very long time.
1034	And the killer app for the rest of the planet is the instrumentation
1038	and the fabrication divide: people locally developing solutions
1041	to local problems. Thank you.
