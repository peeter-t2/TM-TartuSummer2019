13.999	Well, we all need a reason to wake up.
18.898	For me, it just took 11,000 volts.
23.068	I know you're too polite to ask,
24.766	so I will tell you.
27.354	One night, sophomore year of college,
29.601	just back from Thanksgiving holiday,
33.323	a few of my friends and I
33.323	were horsing around,
35.999	and we decided to climb atop
35.999	a parked commuter train.
40.167	It was just sitting there,
40.167	with the wires that run overhead.
43.305	Somehow, that seemed
43.305	like a great idea at the time.
46.804	We'd certainly done stupider things.
50.27	I scurried up the ladder on the back,
53.315	and when I stood up,
55.061	the electrical current entered my arm,
58.667	blew down and out my feet,
58.667	and that was that.
63.699	Would you believe that watch still works?
68.216	Takes a licking!
69.447	(Laughter)
70.502	My father wears it now in solidarity.
75.295	That night began my formal relationship
75.295	with death -- my death --
81.342	and it also began
81.342	my long run as a patient.
85.174	It's a good word.
86.352	It means one who suffers.
88.825	So I guess we're all patients.
91.607	Now, the American health care system
93.997	has more than its fair share
93.997	of dysfunction --
97.142	to match its brilliance, to be sure.
99.75	I'm a physician now,
99.75	a hospice and palliative medicine doc,
104.226	so I've seen care from both sides.
107.076	And believe me: almost everyone
107.076	who goes into healthcare
110.999	really means well -- I mean, truly.
114.874	But we who work in it
114.874	are also unwitting agents
118.831	for a system that too often
118.831	does not serve.
123.999	Why?
125.624	Well, there's actually a pretty easy
125.624	answer to that question,
129.029	and it explains a lot:
131.301	because healthcare was designed
131.301	with diseases, not people, at its center.
138.419	Which is to say, of course,
138.419	it was badly designed.
142.158	And nowhere are the effects
142.158	of bad design more heartbreaking
148.234	or the opportunity
148.234	for good design more compelling
151.593	than at the end of life,
153.758	where things are so distilled
153.758	and concentrated.
158.234	There are no do-overs.
162.073	My purpose today is
162.073	to reach out across disciplines
166.588	and invite design thinking
166.588	into this big conversation.
171.495	That is, to bring intention and creativity
176.876	to the experience of dying.
181.235	We have a monumental
181.235	opportunity in front of us,
185.292	before one of the few universal issues
189.657	as individuals as well as a civil society:
192.991	to rethink and redesign how it is we die.
199.489	So let's begin at the end.
203.611	For most people, the scariest thing
203.611	about death isn't being dead,
207.57	it's dying, suffering.
209.809	It's a key distinction.
212.461	To get underneath this,
212.461	it can be very helpful
214.653	to tease out suffering
214.653	which is necessary as it is,
219.031	from suffering we can change.
222.317	The former is a natural,
222.317	essential part of life, part of the deal,
227.577	and to this we are called
227.577	to make space, adjust, grow.
235.013	It can be really good
235.013	to realize forces larger than ourselves.
241.098	They bring proportionality,
244.246	like a cosmic right-sizing.
248.779	After my limbs were gone,
251.237	that loss, for example,
251.237	became fact, fixed --
255.847	necessarily part of my life,
259.184	and I learned that I could no more
259.184	reject this fact than reject myself.
267.173	It took me a while,
267.173	but I learned it eventually.
270.572	Now, another great thing
270.572	about necessary suffering
273.04	is that it is the very thing
276.572	that unites caregiver and care receiver --
281.999	human beings.
285.089	This, we are finally realizing,
285.089	is where healing happens.
289.673	Yes, compassion -- literally,
289.673	as we learned yesterday --
293.217	suffering together.
296.672	Now, on the systems side,
296.672	on the other hand,
300.034	so much of the suffering
300.034	is unnecessary, invented.
304.376	It serves no good purpose.
306.674	But the good news is,
306.674	since this brand of suffering is made up,
310.999	well, we can change it.
313.681	How we die is indeed
313.681	something we can affect.
318.446	Making the system sensitive
318.446	to this fundamental distinction
322.523	between necessary
322.523	and unnecessary suffering
325.999	gives us our first of three
325.999	design cues for the day.
330.299	After all, our role as caregivers,
330.299	as people who care,
334.852	is to relieve suffering --
334.852	not add to the pile.
342.292	True to the tenets of palliative care,
344.187	I function as something
344.187	of a reflective advocate,
347.884	as much as prescribing physician.
351.177	Quick aside: palliative care -- a very
351.177	important field but poorly understood --
357.222	while it includes, it is not
357.222	limited to end of life care.
360.2	It is not limited to hospice.
362.811	It's simply about comfort
362.811	and living well at any stage.
366.999	So please know that you don't
366.999	have to be dying anytime soon
370.062	to benefit from palliative care.
373.45	Now, let me introduce you to Frank.
377.768	Sort of makes this point.
379.007	I've been seeing Frank now for years.
381.061	He's living with advancing prostate cancer
381.061	on top of long-standing HIV.
386.197	We work on his bone pain and his fatigue,
388.207	but most of the time we spend thinking
388.207	out loud together about his life --
392.945	really, about our lives.
395.071	In this way, Frank grieves.
397.207	In this way, he keeps up with
397.207	his losses as they roll in,
401.01	so that he's ready to take in
401.01	the next moment.
405.524	Loss is one thing,
405.524	but regret, quite another.
411.243	Frank has always been an adventurer --
413.224	he looks like something
413.224	out of a Norman Rockwell painting --
416.089	and no fan of regret.
418.566	So it wasn't surprising
418.566	when he came into clinic one day,
421.271	saying he wanted to raft
421.271	down the Colorado River.
425.142	Was this a good idea?
427.268	With all the risks to his safety
427.268	and his health, some would say no.
431.496	Many did, but he went for it,
431.496	while he still could.
435.999	It was a glorious, marvelous trip:
440.928	freezing water, blistering dry heat,
440.928	scorpions, snakes,
446.274	wildlife howling off the flaming walls
446.274	of the Grand Canyon --
451.729	all the glorious side of the world
451.729	beyond our control.
456.492	Frank's decision, while maybe dramatic,
458.406	is exactly the kind
458.406	so many of us would make,
460.717	if we only had the support to figure out
460.717	what is best for ourselves over time.
469.291	So much of what we're talking about today
469.291	is a shift in perspective.
474.723	After my accident,
474.723	when I went back to college,
476.999	I changed my major to art history.
480.095	Studying visual art, I figured
480.095	I'd learn something about how to see --
485.705	a really potent lesson
485.705	for a kid who couldn't change
489.103	so much of what he was seeing.
492.602	Perspective, that kind of alchemy
492.602	we humans get to play with,
496.364	turning anguish into a flower.
501.999	Flash forward: now I work
501.999	at an amazing place in San Francisco
505.815	called the Zen Hospice Project,
508.078	where we have a little ritual
508.078	that helps with this shift in perspective.
512.405	When one of our residents dies,
515.49	the mortuary men come, and as we're
515.49	wheeling the body out through the garden,
519.984	heading for the gate, we pause.
522.038	Anyone who wants --
524.247	fellow residents, family,
524.247	nurses, volunteers,
526.995	the hearse drivers too, now --
529.463	shares a story or a song or silence,
533.914	as we sprinkle the body
533.914	with flower petals.
537.282	It takes a few minutes;
539.61	it's a sweet, simple parting image
539.61	to usher in grief with warmth,
544.999	rather than repugnance.
548.06	Contrast that with the typical experience
548.06	in the hospital setting,
553.13	much like this -- floodlit room
553.13	lined with tubes and beeping machines
558.018	and blinking lights that don't stop
558.018	even when the patient's life has.
563.419	Cleaning crew swoops in,
563.419	the body's whisked away,
566.469	and it all feels as though that person
566.469	had never really existed.
573.07	Well-intended, of course,
573.07	in the name of sterility,
575.717	but hospitals tend to assault our senses,
579.237	and the most we might hope for
579.237	within those walls is numbness --
584.765	anesthetic, literally
584.765	the opposite of aesthetic.
590.499	I revere hospitals for what they can do;
590.499	I am alive because of them.
596.096	But we ask too much of our hospitals.
599.436	They are places for acute trauma
599.436	and treatable illness.
603.053	They are no place to live and die;
603.053	that's not what they were designed for.
610.078	Now mind you -- I am not
610.078	giving up on the notion
612.402	that our institutions
612.402	can become more humane.
616.057	Beauty can be found anywhere.
621.092	I spent a few months in a burn unit
623.388	at St. Barnabas Hospital
623.388	in Livingston, New Jersey,
626.16	where I got really
626.16	great care at every turn,
630.341	including good
630.341	palliative care for my pain.
633.415	And one night, it began to snow outside.
637.426	I remember my nurses
637.426	complaining about driving through it.
642.103	And there was no window in my room,
644.311	but it was great to just imagine it
644.311	coming down all sticky.
649.299	Next day, one of my nurses
649.299	smuggled in a snowball for me.
653.257	She brought it in to the unit.
656.731	I cannot tell you the rapture I felt
656.731	holding that in my hand,
662.163	and the coldness dripping
662.163	onto my burning skin;
665.236	the miracle of it all,
667.57	the fascination as I watched it melt
667.57	and turn into water.
675.293	In that moment,
677.448	just being any part of this planet
677.448	in this universe mattered more to me
681.96	than whether I lived or died.
684.083	That little snowball packed
684.083	all the inspiration I needed
687.23	to both try to live
687.23	and be OK if I did not.
691.176	In a hospital, that's a stolen moment.
696.356	In my work over the years,
696.356	I've known many people
699.769	who were ready to go, ready to die.
703.192	Not because they had found
703.192	some final peace or transcendence,
707.999	but because they were so repulsed
707.999	by what their lives had become --
714.553	in a word, cut off, or ugly.
723.394	There are already record numbers of us
723.394	living with chronic and terminal illness,
729.504	and into ever older age.
731.947	And we are nowhere near ready
731.947	or prepared for this silver tsunami.
739.335	We need an infrastructure
739.335	dynamic enough to handle
742.62	these seismic shifts in our population.
747.637	Now is the time to create
747.637	something new, something vital.
750.681	I know we can because we have to.
753.065	The alternative is just unacceptable.
755.651	And the key ingredients are known:
757.557	policy, education and training,
761.255	systems, bricks and mortar.
764.642	We have tons of input
764.642	for designers of all stripes to work with.
769.123	We know, for example, from research
771.028	what's most important to people
771.028	who are closer to death:
774.538	comfort; feeling unburdened
774.538	and unburdening to those they love;
781.527	existential peace; and a sense
781.527	of wonderment and spirituality.
788.896	Over Zen Hospice's nearly 30 years,
792.678	we've learned much more
792.678	from our residents in subtle detail.
797.662	Little things aren't so little.
801.499	Take Janette.
802.697	She finds it harder to breathe
802.697	one day to the next due to ALS.
806.208	Well, guess what?
808.121	She wants to start smoking again --
811.523	and French cigarettes, if you please.
816.786	Not out of some self-destructive bent,
819.033	but to feel her lungs filled
819.033	while she has them.
824.786	Priorities change.
827.556	Or Kate -- she just wants to know
830.051	her dog Austin is lying
830.051	at the foot of her bed,
834.11	his cold muzzle against her dry skin,
837.851	instead of more chemotherapy
837.851	coursing through her veins --
840.598	she's done that.
842.849	Sensuous, aesthetic gratification,
842.849	where in a moment, in an instant,
847.889	we are rewarded for just being.
855.373	So much of it comes down to
855.373	loving our time by way of the senses,
859.679	by way of the body -- the very thing
859.679	doing the living and the dying.
866.258	Probably the most poignant room
867.841	in the Zen Hospice guest house
867.841	is our kitchen,
870.118	which is a little strange when you realize
872.179	that so many of our residents
872.179	can eat very little, if anything at all.
876.016	But we realize we are providing
876.016	sustenance on several levels:
881.91	smell, a symbolic plane.
886.356	Seriously, with all the heavy-duty stuff
886.356	happening under our roof,
891.297	one of the most tried and true
891.297	interventions we know of,
895.055	is to bake cookies.
910.144	As long as we have our senses --
911.772	even just one --
913.808	we have at least
913.808	the possibility of accessing
917.241	what makes us feel human, connected.
922.999	Imagine the ripples of this notion
925.809	for the millions of people
925.809	living and dying with dementia.
929.554	Primal sensorial delights that say
929.554	the things we don't have words for,
933.843	impulses that make us stay present --
936.741	no need for a past or a future.
942.28	So, if teasing unnecessary suffering out
942.28	of the system was our first design cue,
950.559	then tending to dignity
950.559	by way of the senses,
953.287	by way of the body --
953.287	the aesthetic realm --
957.103	is design cue number two.
959.944	Now this gets us quickly to the third
959.944	and final bit for today;
963.774	namely, we need to lift our sights,
963.774	to set our sights on well-being,
970.662	so that life and health and healthcare
973.999	can become about making life
973.999	more wonderful,
976.408	rather than just less horrible.
980.196	Beneficence.
982.999	Here, this gets right at the distinction
985.158	between a disease-centered and a patient-
985.158	or human-centered model of care,
990.316	and here is where caring
990.316	becomes a creative, generative,
993.801	even playful act.
996.657	"""Play"" may sound like a funny word here."
999.687	But it is also one of our
999.687	highest forms of adaptation.
1002.615	Consider every major compulsory effort
1002.615	it takes to be human.
1007.298	The need for food has birthed cuisine.
1009.825	The need for shelter
1009.825	has given rise to architecture.
1012.437	The need for cover, fashion.
1014.667	And for being subjected to the clock,
1017.422	well, we invented music.
1023.766	So, since dying
1023.766	is a necessary part of life,
1026.999	what might we create with this fact?
1032.054	"By ""play"" I am in no way suggesting"
1032.054	we take a light approach to dying
1035.454	or that we mandate
1035.454	any particular way of dying.
1038.117	There are mountains of sorrow
1038.117	that cannot move,
1040.999	and one way or another,
1040.999	we will all kneel there.
1044.999	Rather, I am asking that we make space --
1048.524	physical, psychic room, to allow life
1048.524	to play itself all the way out --
1054.291	so that rather than just
1054.291	getting out of the way,
1057.672	aging and dying can become
1057.672	a process of crescendo through to the end.
1064.931	We can't solve for death.
1070.283	I know some of you are working on this.
1072.614	(Laughter)
1077.003	Meanwhile, we can --
1078.839	(Laughter)
1080.879	We can design towards it.
1084.042	Parts of me died early on,
1085.441	and that's something we can all say
1085.441	one way or another.
1088.583	I got to redesign my life
1088.583	around this fact,
1091.248	and I tell you it has been a liberation
1094.612	to realize you can always find
1094.612	a shock of beauty or meaning
1097.791	in what life you have left,
1100.082	like that snowball lasting
1100.082	for a perfect moment,
1102.87	all the while melting away.
1106.7	If we love such moments ferociously,
1112.743	then maybe we can learn to live well --
1115.039	not in spite of death,
1117.15	but because of it.
1122.52	Let death be what takes us,
1124.72	not lack of imagination.
1128.868	Thank you.
1130.044	(Applause)
