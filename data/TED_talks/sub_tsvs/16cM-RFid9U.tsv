12.781	I want to tell you the story
14.362	about the time I almost got kidnapped
18.214	in the trunk of a red Mazda Miata.
22.157	It's the day after graduating
22.157	from design school
25.129	and I'm having a yard sale.
26.638	And this guy pulls up in this red Mazda
29.356	and he starts looking through my stuff.
31.491	And he buys a piece of art that I made.
34.466	And it turns out he's alone
34.466	in town for the night,
38.109	driving cross-country on a road trip
40.686	before he goes into the Peace Corps.
42.822	So I invite him out for a beer
45.202	and he tells me all about his passion
47.647	for making a difference in the world.
50.647	Now it's starting to get late,
52.11	and I'm getting pretty tired.
54.757	As I motion for the tab,
56.428	I make the mistake of asking him,
59.493	"""So where are you staying tonight?"""
61.838	And he makes it worse by saying,
64.138	"""Actually, I don't have a place."""
67.575	"And I'm thinking, ""Oh, man!"""
70.662	What do you do?
72.751	We've all been there, right?
75.212	Do I offer to host this guy?
77.37	But, I just met him -- I mean,
79.507	he says he's going to the Peace Corps,
81.357	but I don't really know if he's going
81.357	to the Peace Corps
84.016	and I don't want to end up kidnapped
84.016	in the trunk of a Miata.
86.92	That's a small trunk!
90.062	So then I hear myself saying,
92.179	"""Hey, I have an airbed you can stay on"
92.179	"in my living room."""
96.06	And the voice in my head goes,
97.571	"""Wait, what?"""
100.634	That night, I'm laying in bed,
102.539	I'm staring at the ceiling and thinking,
105.211	"""Oh my god, what have I done?"
108.501	There's a complete stranger
108.501	sleeping in my living room.
112.702	"What if he's psychotic?"""
115.029	My anxiety grows so much,
116.353	I leap out of bed,
118.237	I sneak on my tiptoes to the door,
120.954	and I lock the bedroom door.
124.274	It turns out he was not psychotic.
126.898	We've kept in touch ever since.
128.447	And the piece of art
128.447	he bought at the yard sale
130.761	is hanging in his classroom;
130.761	he's a teacher now.
135.025	This was my first hosting experience,
136.836	and it completely changed my perspective.
141.198	Maybe the people that my childhood
141.198	taught me to label as strangers
145.984	were actually friends waiting
145.984	to be discovered.
149.606	The idea of hosting people on airbeds
149.606	gradually became natural to me
153.511	and when I moved to San Francisco,
155.194	I brought the airbed with me.
157.185	So now it's two years later.
159.172	I'm unemployed, I'm almost broke,
162.075	my roommate moves out,
162.075	and then the rent goes up.
166.248	And then I learn there's a design
166.248	conference coming to town,
169.075	and all the hotels are sold out.
170.89	And I've always believed
170.89	that turning fear into fun
174.394	is the gift of creativity.
176.749	So here's what I pitch my best friend
176.749	and my new roommate Brian Chesky:
182.084	"""Brian, thought of a way"
182.084	to make a few bucks --
184.408	turning our place into 'designers
184.408	bed and breakfast,'
186.915	offering young designers who come
186.915	to town a place to crash,
189.718	complete with wireless Internet,
189.718	a small desk space,
192.189	sleeping mat, and breakfast each morning.
194.229	"Ha!"""
196.566	We built a basic website
196.566	and Airbed and Breakfast was born.
200.78	Three lucky guests got to stay
202.969	on a 20-dollar airbed
202.969	on the hardwood floor.
206.052	But they loved it, and so did we.
209.024	I swear, the ham
209.024	and Swiss cheese omelets we made
211.43	tasted totally different
211.43	because we made them for our guests.
215.618	We took them on adventures
215.618	around the city,
217.824	and when we said goodbye
217.824	to the last guest,
220.46	the door latch clicked,
222.927	Brian and I just stared at each other.
225.811	Did we just discover
225.811	it was possible to make friends
229.294	while also making rent?
232.08	The wheels had started to turn.
234.023	My old roommate, Nate Blecharczyk,
235.698	joined as engineering co-founder.
238.93	And we buckled down to see
240.643	if we could turn this into a business.
243.956	Here's what we pitched investors:
248.507	"""We want to build a website"
249.838	where people publicly post pictures
249.838	of their most intimate spaces,
253.404	their bedrooms, the bathrooms --
255.285	the kinds of rooms you usually keep closed
255.285	when people come over.
258.735	And then, over the Internet,
260.43	they're going to invite complete strangers
260.43	to come sleep in their homes.
263.887	"It's going to be huge!"""
265.316	(Laughter)
267.506	We sat back, and we waited
267.506	for the rocket ship to blast off.
271.24	It did not.
274.994	No one in their right minds
274.994	would invest in a service
277.53	that allows strangers
277.53	to sleep in people's homes.
280.126	Why?
281.629	Because we've all been taught
281.629	as kids, strangers equal danger.
286.038	Now, when you're faced with a problem,
286.038	you fall back on what you know,
289.609	and all we really knew was design.
292.751	In art school, you learn
292.751	that design is much more
295.236	than the look and feel of something --
295.236	it's the whole experience.
298.881	We learned to do that for objects,
300.556	but here, we were aiming
300.556	to build Olympic trust
304.864	between people who had never met.
308.504	Could design make that happen?
311.35	Is it possible to design for trust?
315.801	I want to give you a sense
315.801	of the flavor of trust
318.826	that we were aiming to achieve.
321.412	I've got a 30-second experiment
323.146	that will push you past your comfort zone.
325.618	If you're up for it, give me a thumbs-up.
330.429	OK, I need you to take out your phones.
338.773	Now that you have your phone out,
340.39	I'd like you to unlock your phone.
345.807	Now hand your unlocked phone
345.807	to the person on your left.
349.648	(Laughter)
361.734	That tiny sense of panic
361.734	you're feeling right now --
364.571	(Laughter)
366.27	is exactly how hosts feel the first time
366.27	they open their home.
370.581	Because the only thing
370.581	more personal than your phone
373.362	is your home.
375.171	People don't just see your messages,
376.914	they see your bedroom,
378.197	your kitchen, your toilet.
381.401	Now, how does it feel holding
381.401	someone's unlocked phone?
386.185	Most of us feel really responsible.
389.017	That's how most guests feel
389.017	when they stay in a home.
392.842	And it's because of this
392.842	that our company can even exist.
396.619	By the way, who's holding Al Gore's phone?
399.118	(Laughter)
402.6	Would you tell Twitter
402.6	he's running for President?
405.221	(Laughter)
407.246	(Applause)
415.719	OK, you can hand your phones back now.
423.589	So now that you've experienced
423.589	the kind of trust challenge
426.864	we were facing,
428.128	I'd love to share a few discoveries
428.128	we've made along the way.
432.011	What if we changed one small thing
434.294	about the design of that experiment?
436.362	What if your neighbor had introduced
436.362	themselves first, with their name,
440.169	where they're from, the name
440.169	of their kids or their dog?
443.685	Imagine that they had 150 reviews
443.685	of people saying,
447.241	"""They're great at holding"
447.241	"unlocked phones!"""
449.67	(Laughter)
454.709	Now how would you feel
454.709	about handing your phone over?
459.784	It turns out,
460.96	a well-designed reputation system
460.96	is key for building trust.
464.951	And we didn't actually
464.951	get it right the first time.
467.985	It's hard for people to leave bad reviews.
471.447	Eventually, we learned to wait
471.447	until both guests and hosts
475.857	left the review before we reveal them.
479.107	Now, here's a discovery
479.107	we made just last week.
482.984	We did a joint study with Stanford,
484.912	where we looked at people's
484.912	willingness to trust someone
487.93	based on how similar they are in age,
487.93	location and geography.
493.467	The research showed, not surprisingly,
496.451	we prefer people who are like us.
500.094	The more different somebody is,
502.953	the less we trust them.
505.13	Now, that's a natural social bias.
508.532	But what's interesting is what happens
510.91	when you add reputation into the mix,
512.892	in this case, with reviews.
515.398	Now, if you've got
515.398	less than three reviews,
517.439	nothing changes.
519.541	But if you've got more than 10,
522.527	everything changes.
524.467	High reputation beats high similarity.
530.299	The right design can actually
530.299	help us overcome
533.053	one of our most deeply rooted biases.
537.247	Now we also learned that building
537.247	the right amount of trust
540.379	takes the right amount of disclosure.
543.275	This is what happens when a guest
543.275	first messages a host.
547.862	"If you share too little, like, ""Yo,"""
552.886	acceptance rates go down.
554.507	And if you share too much, like,
556.648	"""I'm having issues with my mother,"""
558.365	(Laughter)
559.539	acceptance rates also go down.
562.372	But there's a zone that's just right,
564.341	"like, ""Love the artwork in your place."
564.341	"Coming for vacation with my family."""
568.663	So how do we design for just
568.663	the right amount of disclosure?
573.17	We use the size of the box
573.17	to suggest the right length,
576.639	and we guide them with prompts
576.639	to encourage sharing.
581.2	We bet our whole company
584.145	on the hope that,
585.813	with the right design,
587.72	people would be willing to overcome
587.72	the stranger-danger bias.
591.918	What we didn't realize
593.324	is just how many people
595.782	were ready and waiting
595.782	to put the bias aside.
599.823	This is a graph that shows
599.823	our rate of adoption.
603.63	There's three things happening here.
606.081	The first, an unbelievable amount of luck.
610.841	The second is the efforts of our team.
613.969	And third is the existence
613.969	of a previously unsatisfied need.
619.099	Now, things have been going pretty well.
621.5	Obviously, there are times
621.5	when things don't work out.
625.647	Guests have thrown unauthorized parties
627.635	and trashed homes.
629.984	Hosts have left guests
629.984	stranded in the rain.
634.355	In the early days, I was customer service,
638.213	and those calls came
638.213	right to my cell phone.
641.071	I was at the front lines
641.071	of trust breaking.
645.496	And there's nothing worse
645.496	than those calls,
648.068	it hurts to even think about them.
651.113	And the disappointment
651.113	in the sound of someone's voice
653.83	was and, I would say, still is
656.593	our single greatest motivator
656.593	to keep improving.
660.073	Thankfully, out of the 123 million nights
660.073	we've ever hosted,
665.932	less than a fraction of a percent
665.932	have been problematic.
670.447	Turns out, people
670.447	are justified in their trust.
673.705	And when trust works out right,
675.951	it can be absolutely magical.
679.417	We had a guest stay
679.417	with a host in Uruguay,
682.111	and he suffered a heart attack.
684.274	The host rushed him to the hospital.
687.354	They donated their own blood
687.354	for his operation.
691.342	Let me read you his review.
693.916	(Laughter)
701.053	"""Excellent house for sedentary travelers"
703.356	prone to myocardial infarctions.
705.623	(Laughter)
708.557	The area is beautiful and has
708.557	direct access to the best hospitals.
712.528	(Laughter)
714.036	Javier and Alejandra instantly
714.036	become guardian angels
717.589	who will save your life
717.589	without even knowing you.
721.47	They will rush you to the hospital
721.47	in their own car while you're dying
725.106	and stay in the waiting room
725.106	while the doctors give you a bypass.
729.268	They don't want you to feel lonely,
729.268	they bring you books to read.
732.578	And they let you stay at their house
732.578	extra nights without charging you.
736.629	"Highly recommended!"""
737.883	(Applause)
746.342	Of course, not every stay is like that.
749.089	But this connection beyond the transaction
751.811	is exactly what the sharing
751.811	economy is aiming for.
755.74	Now, when I heard that term,
757.833	I have to admit, it tripped me up.
760.783	How do sharing
760.783	and transactions go together?
764.059	So let's be clear; it is about commerce.
767.832	But if you just called it
767.832	the rental economy,
770.18	it would be incomplete.
772.576	The sharing economy is commerce
772.576	with the promise of human connection.
777.612	People share a part of themselves,
780.513	and that changes everything.
783.428	You know how most travel today is, like,
785.877	I think of it like fast food --
787.632	it's efficient and consistent,
790.833	at the cost of local and authentic.
794.932	What if travel were like
794.932	a magnificent buffet
797.764	of local experiences?
799.437	What if anywhere you visited,
802.392	there was a central marketplace of locals
804.661	offering to get you thoroughly drunk
807.327	on a pub crawl in neighborhoods
807.327	you didn't even know existed.
812.416	Or learning to cook from the chef
812.416	of a five-star restaurant?
817.082	Today, homes are designed around
817.082	the idea of privacy and separation.
822.246	What if homes were designed
822.246	to be shared from the ground up?
826.433	What would that look like?
829.673	What if cities embraced
829.673	a culture of sharing?
833.736	I see a future of shared cities
833.736	that bring us community and connection
838.534	instead of isolation and separation.
841.878	In South Korea, in the city of Seoul,
843.883	they've actually even started this.
845.59	They've repurposed hundreds
845.59	of government parking spots
848.49	to be shared by residents.
850.866	They're connecting students
850.866	who need a place to live
853.487	with empty-nesters who have extra rooms.
856.918	And they've started an incubator
856.918	to help fund the next generation
860.606	of sharing economy start-ups.
864.96	Tonight, just on our service,
873.803	in 191 countries
878.976	will either stay in a stranger's home
882.154	or welcome one into theirs.
886.014	Clearly, it's not as crazy
886.014	as we were taught.
891.169	We didn't invent anything new.
893.568	Hospitality has been around forever.
898.568	There's been many other
898.568	websites like ours.
902.18	So, why did ours eventually take off?
908.513	Luck and timing aside,
911.311	I've learned that you can take
911.311	the components of trust,
913.957	and you can design for that.
919.39	Design can overcome our most deeply rooted
922.395	stranger-danger bias.
923.998	And that's amazing to me.
926.304	It blows my mind.
929.184	I think about this every time
929.184	I see a red Miata go by.
933.99	Now, we know design won't solve
933.99	all the world's problems.
940.511	But if it can help out with this one,
942.318	if it can make a dent in this,
944.709	it makes me wonder,
944.709	what else can we design for next?
952.341	Thank you.
953.516	(Applause)
