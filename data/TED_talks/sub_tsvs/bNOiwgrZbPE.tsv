13.295	Good morning!
15.34	Are you awake?
18.679	They took my name tag,
18.679	but I wanted to ask you,
21.183	did anyone here write their name
21.183	on the tag in Arabic?
23.9	Anyone! No one?
23.9	All right, no problem.
29.529	Once upon a time, not long ago,
33.632	I was sitting in a restaurant with my friend,
33.632	ordering food.
38.477	So I looked at the waiter and said,
42.087	"""Do you have a menu (Arabic)?"""
45.683	He looked at me strangely,
45.683	thinking that he misheard.
49.633	"He said, ""Sorry? (English)."""
52.132	I said,
52.132	"""The menu (Arabic), please."""
56.11	He replied,
56.11	"""Don't you know what they call it?"""
59.714	"""I do."""
61.133	"He said, ""No! It's called ""menu"" (English),"
61.133	"or ""menu"" (French)."""
64.688	Is the French pronunciation correct?
66.663	"""Come, come, take care of this one!"""
66.663	said the waiter.
69.123	He was disgusted when talking to me,
69.123	as if he was saying to himself,
73.458	"""If this was the last girl on Earth,"
73.458	"I wouldn't look at her!"""
77.45	What's the meaning
77.45	"of saying ""menu"" in Arabic?"
79.578	Two words made a Lebanese young man
79.578	judge a girl as being backward
88.323	and ignorant.
90.82	How could she speak that way?
96.346	At that moment, I started thinking.
99.059	It made me mad.
100.152	It definitely hurts!
101.326	I'm denied the right to speak
101.326	my own language in my own country?
104.441	Where could this happen?
106.392	How did we get here?
109.732	Well, while we are here,
109.732	there are many people like me,
113.674	who would reach a stage in their lives,
113.674	where they involuntarily give up
117.132	everything
117.132	that has happened to them in the past,
119.42	just so they can say that they're modern
121.699	and civilized.
123.92	Should I forget all my culture, thoughts,
126.835	intellect and all my memories?
131.69	Childhood stories might be the best memories
131.69	we have of the war!
135.118	Should I forget everything
135.118	I learned in Arabic, just to conform?
140.423	To be one of them?
143.878	Where's the logic in that?
146.132	Despite all that,
146.132	I tried to understand him.
149.78	I didn't want to judge him
149.78	with the same cruelty that he judged me.
155.946	The Arabic language
155.946	doesn't satisfy today's needs.
159.902	It's not a language for science,
161.764	research,
163.275	a language we're used to in universities,
165.294	a language we use in the workplace,
167.694	a language we rely on if we were to perform
167.694	an advanced research project,
173.888	and it definitely isn't a language
173.888	we use at the airport.
176.555	If we did so,
176.555	they'd strip us of our clothes.
180.78	Where can I use it, then?
180.78	We could all ask this question!
184.408	So, you want us to use Arabic.
184.408	Where are we to do so?
188.66	This is one reality.
191.24	But we have another more important reality
191.24	that we ought to think about.
196.878	Arabic is the mother tongue.
199.867	Research says that mastery
199.867	of other languages
205.718	demands mastery of the mother tongue.
209.679	Mastery of the mother tongue is a prerequisite
209.679	for creative expression in other languages.
216.514	How?
218.199	Gibran Khalil Gibran,
220.489	when he first started writing,
220.489	he used Arabic.
224.54	All his ideas, imagination and philosophy
231.122	were inspired by this little boy
231.122	in the village
234.869	where he grew up,
234.869	smelling a specific smell,
237.15	hearing a specific voice,
238.421	and thinking a specific thought.
240.206	So, when he started writing in English,
240.206	he had enough baggage.
244.917	Even when he wrote in English,
247.265	when you read his writings in English,
247.265	you smell the same smell,
251.157	sense the same feeling.
253.147	You can imagine that that's him
253.147	writing in English,
256.813	the same boy who came from the mountain.
256.813	From a village on Mount Lebanon.
262.73	So, this is an example
262.73	no one can argue with.
269.401	Second, it's often said
269.401	that if you want to kill a nation,
274.06	the only way to kill a nation,
277.006	is to kill its language.
278.875	This is a reality
278.875	that developed societies are aware of.
284.352	The Germans, French, Japanese and Chinese,
284.352	all these nations are aware of this.
290.876	That's why they legislate
290.876	to protect their language.
294.842	They make it sacred.
297.323	That's why they use it in production,
297.323	they pay a lot of money to develop it.
303.34	Do we know better than them?
306.116	All right,
307.122	we aren't from the developed world,
308.949	this advanced thinking
308.949	hasn't reached us yet,
311.257	and we would like to catch up
311.257	with the civilized world.
315.181	Countries that were once like us,
315.181	but decided to strive for development,
319.514	do research,
321.1	and catch up with those countries,
322.994	such as Turkey, Malaysia and others,
325.933	they carried their language with them
325.933	as they were climbing the ladder,
329.724	protected it like a diamond.
333.131	They kept it close to them.
334.69	Because if you get any product
334.69	from Turkey or elsewhere
339.03	and it's not labeled in Turkish,
341.616	then it isn't a local product.
344.195	You wouldn't believe it's a local product.
347.168	They'd go back to being consumers,
349.8	clueless consumers, like we are
349.8	most of the time.
355.463	So, in order for them to innovate and produce,
355.463	they had to protect their language.
363.187	"If I say, ""Freedom, sovereignty,"
363.187	"independence (Arabic),"""
368.101	what does this remind you of?
372.625	It doesn't ring a bell, does it?
374.819	Regardless of the who, how and why.
379.58	Language isn't just for conversing,
379.58	just words coming out of our mouths.
385.798	Language represents specific stages
385.798	in our lives,
390.69	and terminology
390.69	that is linked to our emotions.
395.723	So when we say,
395.723	"""Freedom, sovereignty, independence,"""
398.155	each one of you draws a specific image
398.155	in their own mind,
401.778	there are specific feelings
404.444	of a specific day
404.444	in a specific historical period.
407.121	Language isn't one, two
407.121	or three words or letters put together.
410.765	It's an idea inside
410.765	that relates to how we think,
413.339	and how we see each other
413.339	and how others see us.
419.003	What is our intellect?
420.977	How do you say
420.977	whether this guy understands or not?
423.639	"So, if I say, ""Freedom, sovereignty,"
423.639	"independence (English),"""
432.164	or if your son came up to you and said,
434.265	"""Dad, have you lived through the period of"
434.265	"the freedom (English) slogan?"""
438.971	How would you feel?
441.741	If you don't see a problem,
445.665	then I'd better leave,
445.665	and stop talking in vain.
449.334	The idea is that these expressions
449.334	remind us of a specific thing.
455.25	I have a francophone friend
455.25	who's married to a French man.
460.946	I asked her once how things were going.
464.253	She said,
464.253	"""Everything is fine,"
465.921	but once, I spent a whole night
465.921	asking and trying to translate
470.37	the meaning of the word
470.37	"'toqborni' for him."""
472.97	(Laughter)
474.385	(Applause)
482.013	The poor woman had mistakenly told him
482.013	"""toqborni,"""
485.483	and then spent the whole night
485.483	trying to explain it to him.
488.335	He was puzzled by the thought:
488.335	"""How could anyone be this cruel?"
492.093	Does she want to commit suicide?
494.369	"'Bury me?' (English)"""
497.085	This is one of the few examples.
499.623	It made us feel that she's unable to tell
499.623	that word to her husband,
502.772	since he won't understand,
505.461	and he's right not to;
505.461	his way of thinking is different.
508.862	She said to me,
508.862	"""He listens to Fairuz with me,"
512.446	and one night,
512.446	I tried to translate for him
516.991	so he can feel what I feel when
516.991	"I listen to Fairuz."""
520.31	The poor woman tried to translate
520.31	this for him:
522.59	"""From them I extended my hands"
522.59	"and stole you --"""
526.755	(Laughter)
528	And here's the pickle:
529.405	"""And because you belong to them,"
529.405	"I returned my hands and left you."""
533.5	(Laughter)
534.765	Translate that for me.
536.14	(Applause)
543.804	So, what have we done to protect
543.804	the Arabic language?
548.129	We turned this into a concern
548.129	of the civil society,
551.495	and we launched a campaign to preserve
551.495	the Arabic language.
554.279	Even though many people told me,
554.279	"""Why do you bother?"
557.644	Forget about this headache
557.644	"and go have fun."""
560.717	No problem!
562.434	The campaign to preserve Arabic
562.434	launched a slogan that says,
565.527	"""I talk to you from the East,"
565.527	"but you reply from the West."""
568.62	We didn't say,
568.62	"""No! We do not accept this or that."""
576.188	We didn't adopt this style because
576.188	that way, we wouldn't be understood.
581.203	And when someone talks to me that way,
581.203	I hate the Arabic language.
584.947	We say--
586.359	(Applause)
589.271	We want to change our reality,
591.703	and be convinced in a way that reflects
591.703	our dreams, aspirations and day-to-day life.
596.655	In a way that dresses like us
596.655	and thinks like we do.
601.95	"So, ""I talk to you from the East,"
601.95	"but you reply from the West"""
604.823	has hit the spot.
606.476	Something very easy,
606.476	yet creative and persuasive.
610.579	After that,
610.579	we launched another campaign
614.277	with scenes of letters on the ground.
617.795	You've seen an example of it outside,
620.284	a scene of a letter surrounded
620.284	by black and yellow tape
624.666	"with ""Don't kill your language!"""
624.666	written on it.
627.508	Why?
627.508	Seriously, don't kill your language.
631.212	We really shouldn't kill our language.
634.266	If we were to kill the language,
634.266	we'd have to find an identity.
639.424	We'd have to find an existence.
641.383	We'd go back to the beginning.
643.768	This is beyond just missing our chance
643.768	of being modern and civilized.
651.26	After that we released photos
651.26	of guys and girls wearing the Arabic letter.
657.62	"Photos of ""cool"" guys and girls."
660.263	We are very cool!
662.904	And to whoever might say,
662.904	"""Ha! You used an English word!"""
667.278	I say,
667.278	"""No! I adopt the word 'cool.'"""
671.12	Let them object however they want,
671.12	but give me a word that's nicer
674.895	and matches the reality better.
677.591	"I will keep on saying ""Internet"""
679.565	I wouldn't say:
679.565	"""I'm going to the world wide web"""
682.399	(Laughs)
684.175	Because it doesn't fit!
684.175	We shouldn't kid ourselves.
687.686	But to reach this point,
687.686	we all have to be convinced
691.885	that we shouldn't allow anyone
691.885	who is bigger
694.02	or thinks they have any authority over us
694.02	when it comes to language,
697.356	to control us or make us think and feel
697.356	what they want.
703.685	Creativity is the idea.
707.653	So, if we can't reach space
707.653	or build a rocket and so on,
710.213	we can be creative.
712.113	At this moment, every one of you
712.113	is a creative project.
715.95	Creativity in your mother tongue
715.95	is the path.
718.798	Let's start from this moment.
722.534	Let's write a novel
722.534	or produce a short film.
724.596	A single novel could make us global again.
727.934	It could bring the Arabic language
727.934	back to being number one.
732.38	So, it's not true that there's no solution;
732.38	there is a solution!
736.231	But we have to know that, and be convinced
736.231	that a solution exists,
740.23	that we have a duty
740.23	to be part of that solution.
743.929	In conclusion, what can you do today?
746.836	Now, tweets, who's tweeting?
752.06	Please, I beg of you,
752.06	even though my time has finished,
757.43	either Arabic, English, French
757.43	or Chinese.
762.577	But don't write Arabic
762.577	with Latin characters mixed with numbers!
768.298	(Applause)
772.408	It's a disaster!
772.408	That's not a language.
775.866	You'd be entering a virtual world
775.866	with a virtual language.
779.562	It's not easy to come back
779.562	from such a place and rise.
782.724	That's the first thing we can do.
784.896	Second, there are many other things
784.896	that we can do.
787.499	We're not here today to convince
787.499	each other.
789.904	We're here to bring attention
789.904	to the necessity of preserving this language.
793.438	Now I will tell you a secret.
797.303	A baby first identifies its father
802.49	through language.
804.557	When my daughter is born, I'll tell her,
804.557	"""This is your father, honey (Arabic)."""
809.796	I wouldn't say,
809.796	"""This is your dad, honey (English)."""
814.585	And in the supermarket,
814.585	I promise my daughter Noor,
817.77	that if she says to me,
817.77	"""Thanks (Arabic),"""
820.086	"I won't say, ""Dis, 'Merci, Maman,'"""
820.086	and hope no one has heard her.
824.813	(Applause)
835.98	Let's get rid of this cultural cringe.
841.297	(Applause)
