12.144	I've come here today
13.464	to talk to you about a problem.
16.151	It's a very simple yet devastating problem,
19.678	one that spans the globe
21.623	and is affecting all of us.
24.536	The problem is
26.621	anonymous companies.
29.346	It sounds like a really dry and technical thing,
31.436	doesn't it?
32.492	But anonymous companies are making it difficult
34.994	and sometimes impossible
37.546	to find out
39.395	the actual human beings responsible
42.394	sometimes for really terrible crimes.
47.604	So, why am I here talking to all of you?
52.646	Well, I guess I am a lifelong troublemaker
56.176	and when my parents taught my twin brother and I
59.127	to question authority,
61.033	I don't think they knew where it might lead.
63.044	(Laughter)
64.399	And, they probably really regretted it
66.238	during my stroppy teenage years when, predictably,
69.376	I questioned their authority a lot.
71.994	And a lot of my school teachers
73.589	didn't appreciate it much either.
76.717	You see, since the age of about five
78.852	I've always asked the question, but why?
82.525	But why does the Earth go around the sun?
85.154	But why is blood red?
86.991	But why do I have to go to school?
89.298	But why do I have to respect the teachers
91.311	and authority?
93.178	And little did I realize
94.82	that this question would become the basis
97.598	of everything I would do.
100.251	And so it was
102.006	in my twenties, a long time ago,
104.49	that one rainy Sunday afternoon in North London
108.571	I was sitting with Simon Taylor
110.36	and Patrick Alley
112.368	and we were busy stuffing envelopes
114.233	for a mail out in the office of the campaign group
117.283	where we worked at the time.
119.538	And as usual, we were talking 
119.538	about the world's problems.
123.623	And in particular, we were talking about
125.437	the civil war in Cambodia.
128.357	And we had talked about that 
128.357	many, many times before.
132.588	But then suddenly we stopped
134.875	and looked at each other
136.419	and said, but why don't we try and change this?
140.648	And from that slightly crazy question,
143.251	over two decades
145.093	and many campaigns later,
147.359	including alerting the world
149.15	to the problem of blood diamonds funding war,
152.366	from that crazy question,
154.427	Global Witness is now an 80-strong team
157.288	of campaigners, investigators, 
157.288	journalists and lawyers.
161.81	And we're all driven by the same belief,
164.113	that change really is possible.
168.577	So, what exactly does Global Witness do?
171.696	We investigate, we report,
173.93	to uncover the people really responsible
176.652	for funding conflict --
178.565	for stealing millions from citizens around the world,
182.076	also known as state looting,
183.913	and for destroying the environment.
186.522	And then we campaign hard to 
186.522	change the system itself.
191.686	And we're doing this because 
191.686	so many of the countries
194.447	rich in natural resources
196.323	like oil or diamonds or timber
199.035	are home to some of the poorest
201.539	and most dispossessed people on the planet.
205.939	And much of this injustice
207.433	is made possible
209.087	by currently accepted business practices.
212.819	And one of these is anonymous companies.
217.036	Now we've come up against anonymous companies
219.13	in lots of our investigations,
221.27	like in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
223.952	where we exposed how secretive deals
226.704	involving anonymous companies
228.337	had deprived the citizens
230.522	of one of the poorest countries on the planet
234.487	of well over a billion dollars.
236.363	That's twice the country's health 
236.363	and education budget combined.
241.894	Or in Liberia,
243.215	where an international predatory logging company
246.063	used front companies as it attempted to grab
248.626	a really huge chunk of Liberia's unique forests.
252.815	Or political corruption in Sarawak, Malaysia,
255.898	which has led to the destruction 
255.898	of much of its forests.
259.093	Well, that uses anonymous companies too.
263.234	We secretly filmed some of the family
265.523	of the former chief minister and a lawyer
268.32	as they told our undercover investigator
270.592	exactly how these dubious deals are done
273.344	using such companies.
276.42	And the awful thing is,
278.193	there are so many other examples out there
281.499	from all walks of life.
285.503	This truly is a scandal of epic proportions
289.721	hidden in plain sight.
292.486	Whether it's the ruthless Mexican drugs cartel,
295.265	the Zetas,
296.308	who use anonymous companies 
296.308	to launder profits
298.962	while their drugs-related violence
300.908	is tearing communities apart across the Americas.
305.526	Or the anonymous company,
307.474	which bought up Americans' tax debts,
309.745	piled on the legal fees
311.537	and then gave homeowners a choice:
312.921	Pay up or lose your home.
315.935	Imagine being threatened with losing your home
318.613	sometimes over a debt of just a few hundred dollars,
321.327	and not being able to find out
322.697	who you were really up against.
326.233	Now anonymous companies
327.672	are great for sanctions busting too.
330.546	As the Iranian government found out
333.092	when, through a series of front companies,
334.927	it owned a building in the very heart of Manhattan,
338.02	on Fifth Avenue,
340.314	despite American sanctions.
343.209	And Juicy Couture, home of of the velvet track suit,
346.343	and other companies were the unwitting,
349.072	unknowing tenants there.
352.179	There are just so many examples,
354.31	the horesemeat scandal in Europe,
356.766	the Italian mafia, they've used these companies
359.263	for decades.
361.052	The $100 million American Medicare fraud,
366.811	the supply of weapons to wars around the world
370.583	including those
371.61	in Eastern Europe in the early '90s.
374.396	Anonymous companies
375.674	have even come to light
377.33	in the recent revolution in the Ukraine.
381.696	But, for every case that we and others expose
386.201	there are so many more that will remain hidden away
389.418	because of the current system.
391.815	And it's just a simple truth
393.774	that some of the people responsible 
393.774	for outrageous crimes,
398.391	for stealing from you and me
400.631	and millions of others,
402.675	they are remaining faceless
403.858	and they are escaping accountability
406.343	and they're doing this with ease,
408.515	and they're doing it using legal structures.
411.93	And really, that is unfair.
416.951	Well, you might well ask,
418.89	what exactly is an anonymous company,
421.784	and can I really set one up, and use it,
424.192	without anyone knowing who I am?
426.92	Well, the answer is, yes you can.
428.651	But if you're anything like me,
430.366	you'll want to see some of that for yourself,
432.378	so let me show you.
434.086	Well first you need to work out
435.403	where you want to set it up.
437.441	Now, at this point you might be imagining
439.418	one of those lovely tropical island tax havens
442.936	but here's the thing,
444.941	shockingly,
446.138	my own hometown, London,
448.482	and indeed the U.K.,
449.811	is one of the best places in the world
452.533	to set up an anonymous company.
455.437	And the other, even better,
458.126	I'm afraid that's America.
462.049	Do you know, in some states across America
464.505	you need less identification
466.822	to open up a company
468.289	than you do to get a library card,
471.406	like Delaware,
472.662	which is one of the easiest places
474.744	in the world to set up an anonymous company.
478.983	Okay, so let's say it's America,
480.584	and let's say it's Delaware,
482.659	and now you can simply go online
484.522	and find yourself a company service provider.
487.62	These are the companies that 
487.62	can set your one up for you,
490.603	and remember, it's all legal,
490.603	routine business practice.
494.745	So, here's one,
496.384	but there are plenty of others to choose from.
499.311	And having made your choice,
500.942	you then pick what type of company you want
503.448	and then fill in a contact, name and address.
506.564	But don't worry,
507.748	it doesn't have to be your name.
509.307	It can be your lawyer's
510.789	or your service provider's,
512.688	and it's not for the public record anyway.
516.523	And then you add the owner of the company.
519.08	Now this is the key part,
521.019	and again it doesn't have to be you,
522.899	because you can get creative,
525.002	because there is a whole universe 
525.002	out there of nominees
528.551	to choose from.
530.398	And nominees are the people that you
532.734	can legally pay to be your company's owner.
537.57	And if you don't want to involve anyone else,
539.412	it doesn't even have to be an actual human being.
542.275	It could be another company.
545.363	And then finally,
546.793	give your company a name
548.522	add a few more details and make your payment.
551.253	And then the service provider
552.673	will take a few hours or more to process it.
555.456	But there you are,
556.695	in 10 minutes of online shopping
559.075	you can create yourself an anonymous company.
563.289	And not only is it easy,
564.677	really, really easy and cheap,
567.284	it's totally legal too.
569.572	But the fun doesn't have to end there,
573.296	maybe you want to be even more anonymous.
576.095	Well, that's no problem either.
578.198	You can simply keep adding layers,
580.956	companies owned by companies.
583.056	You can have hundreds of layers
584.436	with hundreds of companies spread across
586.524	lots of different countries,
589.181	like a giant web,
590.511	each layer adds anonymity.
592.7	Each layer makes it more difficult
594.93	for law enforcement and others
596.619	to find out who the real owner is.
600.002	But whose interests is this all serving?
604.092	It might be in the interests of the company
606.218	or a particular individual,
607.984	but what about all of us, the public?
610.372	There hasn't even been a global conversation yet
613.141	about whether it's okay
614.561	to misuse companies in this way.
617.796	And what does it all mean for us?
621.674	Well, an example that really haunts me
624.227	is one I came across recently.
626.605	And it's that of a horrific fire
628.554	in a nightclub in Buenos Aires
630.339	about a decade ago.
633.29	It was the night before New Year's Eve.
635.56	Three thousand very happy revelers,
637.728	many of them teenagers,
638.765	were crammed into a space meant for 1,000.
641.96	And then tragedy struck,
643.133	a fire broke out
644.736	plastic decorations were melting from the ceiling
646.82	and toxic smoke filled the club.
648.796	So people tried to escape
650.861	only to find that some of the fire doors
653.494	had been chained shut.
657.155	Over 200 people died.
659.588	Seven hundred were injured trying to get out.
663.347	And as the victims' families 
663.347	and the city and the country
666.892	reeled in shock,
668.436	investigators tried to find out who was responsible.
671.982	And as they looked for the owners of the club,
674.473	they found instead anonymous companies,
678.031	and confusion surrounded the identities of those
680.325	involved with the companies.
682.832	Now ultimately, a range of people were charged
685.294	and some went to jail.
687.321	But this was an awful tragedy,
689.154	and it shouldn't have been so difficult
691.137	just to try and find out who was responsible
695.047	for those deaths.
698.008	Because in an age
699.953	when there is so much information
702.207	out there in the open,
704.204	why should this crucial information
705.878	about company ownership
707.388	stay hidden away?
709.094	Why should tax evaders, corrupt 
709.094	government officials,
712.819	arms traders and more,
715.071	be able to hide their identities from us, the public?
719.109	Why should this secrecy be such 
719.109	an accepted business practice?
724.738	Anonymous companies
726.426	might be the norm right now
728.635	but it wasn't always this way.
730.641	Companies were created
732.438	to give people a chance to innovate
734.71	and not have to put everything on the line.
738.373	Companies were created to limit financial risk,
741.715	they were never intended to 
741.715	be used as a moral shield.
746.665	Companies were never intended to be anonymous,
748.939	and they don't have to be.
751.355	And so I come to my wish.
754.245	My wish is for us to know
757.046	who owns and controls companies
759.772	so that they can no longer be used anonymously
762.522	against the public good.
765.152	Together let's ignite world opinion,
767.818	change the law,
769.295	and launch a new era of openness in business.
774.175	So what might this look like?
775.807	Well, imagine if you could go online
778.376	and look up the real owner of a company.
781.493	Imagine if this data were open and free,
784.265	accessible across borders
785.976	for citizens and businesses
787.775	and law enforcement alike.
789.463	Imagine what a game changer that would be.
793.931	So how are we going to do this?
796.434	Well, there is only one way.
797.88	Together, we have to change the law globally
801.131	to create public registries
803.072	which list the true owners of companies
805.927	and can be accessed by all
807.963	with no loopholes.
810.092	And yes, this is ambitious,
813.824	but there is momentum on this issue,
816.215	and over the years I have seen
818.259	the sheer power of momentum,
820.591	and it's just starting on this issue.
822.975	There is such an opportunity right now.
826.253	And the TED community
828.282	of creative and innovative thinkers and doers
831.647	across all of society
833.544	could make the crucial difference.
836.803	You really can make this change happen.
840.637	Now, a simple starting point
842.439	is the address behind me
843.905	for a Facebook page that you can join now
846.264	to support the campaign and spread the word.
849.01	It's going to be a springboard
850.434	for our global campaigning.
852.395	And the techies among you,
853.87	you could really help us create a prototype
857.243	public registry
858.963	to demonstrate what a powerful tool this could be.
863.839	Campaign groups from around the world
866.35	have come together to work on this issue.
871.21	The U.K. government is already on board;
874.49	it supports these public registries.
876.892	And just last week,
878.79	the European Parliament came on board
881.498	with a vote 600 to 30 in favor of public registries.
886.564	That is momentum.
888.989	(Applause)
893.985	But it's early days.
896.29	America still needs to come on board,
898.782	as do so many other countries.
902.359	And to succeed we will all together
905.468	need to help and push our politicians,
907.912	because without that,
909.499	real far-reaching, world-shifting change
911.467	just isn't going to happen.
914.168	Because this isn't just about changing the law,
916.857	this is about starting a conversation
918.949	about what it's okay for companies to do,
921.342	and in what ways is it acceptable 
921.342	to use company structures.
926.376	This isn't just a dry policy issue.
929.149	This is a human issue
930.637	which affects us all.
933.295	This is about being on the right side of history.
939.699	Global citizens, innovators, 
939.699	business leaders, individuals,
945.057	we need you.
947.044	Together, let's kickstart this global movement.
950.554	Let's just do it,
951.899	let's end anonymous companies.
955.201	Thank you.
957.305	(Applause)
