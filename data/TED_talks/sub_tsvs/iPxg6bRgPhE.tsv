16.407	I want to talk to you today
18.37	about a difficult topic
18.37	that is close to me,
21.657	and closer than you might realize to you.
26.313	I came to the UK 21 years ago,
26.313	as an asylum-seeker.
32.306	I was 21.
34.21	I was forced to leave
34.21	the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
38.089	my home, where I was a student activist.
44.096	I would love my children to be able
44.096	to meet my family in the Congo.
51.355	But I want to tell you
51.355	what the Congo has got to do with you.
56.481	But first of all,
56.481	I want you to do me a favor.
60.549	Can you all please reach into your pockets
60.549	and take out your mobile phone?
69.079	Feel that familiar weight ...
73.683	how naturally your finger
73.683	slides towards the buttons.
76.874	(Laughter)
80.074	Can you imagine your world without it?
82.277	It connects us to our loved ones,
84.785	our family, friends and colleagues,
88.428	at home and overseas.
91.045	It is a symbol of an interconnected world.
95.618	But what you hold in your hand
95.618	leaves a bloody trail,
101.464	and it all boils down to a mineral:
105.349	tantalum, mined in the Congo as coltan.
109.676	It is an anticorrosive heat conductor.
113.176	It stores energy in our mobile phones,
113.176	PlayStations and laptops.
120.076	It is used in aerospace
120.076	and medical equipment as an alloy.
126.37	It is so powerful
126.37	that we only need tiny amounts.
131.603	It would be great
131.603	if the story ended there.
135.469	Unfortunately, what you hold in your hand
139.147	has not only enabled incredible
139.147	technological development
144.884	and industrial expansion,
147.741	but it has also contributed
147.741	to unimaginable human suffering.
153.348	Since 1996,
156.079	over five million people have died
156.079	in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
162.298	Countless women, men and children
162.298	have been raped, tortured or enslaved.
170.336	Rape is used as a weapon of war,
173.163	instilling fear
173.163	and depopulating whole areas.
178.639	The quest for extracting this mineral
182.61	has not only aided, but it has fueled
187.293	the ongoing war in the Congo.
192.535	But don't throw away your phones yet.
195.929	Thirty thousand children are enlisted
200.039	and are made to fight in armed groups.
205.418	The Congo consistently scores dreadfully
209.399	in global health and poverty rankings.
213.927	But remarkably,
215.404	the UN Environmental Programme
215.404	has estimated the wealth of the country
221.124	to be over 24 trillion dollars.
231.286	The state-regulated mining
231.286	industry has collapsed,
235.169	and control over mines has splintered.
238.858	Coltan is easily controlled
238.858	by armed groups.
243.306	One well-known illicit trade route
243.306	is that across the border to Rwanda,
248.514	where Congolese tantalum
248.514	is disguised as Rwandan.
253.471	But don't throw away your phones yet,
256.141	because the incredible irony
258.998	is that the technology
258.998	that has placed such unsustainable,
262.366	devastating demands on the Congo
265.395	is the same technology that has brought
265.395	this situation to our attention.
272.061	We only know so much about the situation
272.061	in the Congo and in the mines
277.005	because of the kind of communication
277.005	the mobile phone allows.
283.485	As with the Arab Spring,
285.787	during the recent elections in the Congo,
289.148	voters were able to send text messages
289.148	of local polling stations
295.221	to the headquarters
295.221	in the capital, Kinshasa.
299.933	And in the wake of the result,
305.287	the diaspora has joined
305.287	with the Carter Center,
309.008	the Catholic Church and other observers,
312.389	to draw attention
312.389	to the undemocratic result.
317.492	The mobile phone has given
317.492	people around the world
322.931	an important tool towards gaining
322.931	their political freedom.
328.225	It has truly revolutionized the way
328.225	we communicate on the planet.
334.116	It has allowed momentous
334.116	political change to take place.
339.832	So, we are faced with a paradox.
345.763	The mobile phone
345.763	is an instrument of freedom
349.83	and an instrument of oppression.
355.275	TED has always celebrated
355.275	what technology can do for us,
361.67	technology in its finished form.
364.225	It is time to be asking questions
364.225	about technology.
370.091	Where does it come from?
372.424	Who makes it?
375.075	And for what?
377.838	Here, I am speaking directly to you,
381.266	the TED community,
383.029	and to all those who might
383.029	be watching on a screen,
386.845	on your phone, across the world,
390.222	in the Congo.
392.737	All the technology is in place
392.737	for us to communicate,
397.031	and all the technology is in place
397.031	to communicate this.
404.019	At the moment,
405.919	there is no clear fair-trade solution.
410.547	But there has been
410.547	a huge amount of progress.
413.927	The US has recently passed legislation
417.579	to target bribery
417.579	and misconduct in the Congo.
421.427	Recent UK legislation
421.427	could be used in the same way.
426.986	In February, Nokia unveiled its new policy
426.986	on sourcing minerals in the Congo,
433.265	and there is a petition to Apple
433.265	to make a conflict-free iPhone.
441.752	There are campaigns spreading
441.752	across university campuses
446.137	to make their colleges conflict-free.
449.595	But we're not there yet.
451.753	We need to continue
451.753	mounting pressure on phone companies
457.796	to change their sourcing processes.
461.766	When I first came to the UK, 21 years ago,
465.534	I was homesick.
467.903	I missed my family
467.903	and the friends I left behind.
473.105	Communication was extremely difficult.
476.727	Sending and receiving
476.727	letters took months --
480.455	if you were lucky.
481.985	Often, they never arrived.
485.432	Even if I could have afforded
485.432	the phone bills home,
490.799	like most people in the Congo,
493.215	my parents did not own a phone line.
497.246	Today, my two sons --
503.668	David and Daniel,
505.746	can talk to my parents
505.746	and get to know them.
513.177	Why should we allow
515.987	such a wonderful, brilliant
515.987	and necessary product
522.906	to be the cause of unnecessary suffering
526.865	for human beings?
529.992	We demand fair-trade food
529.992	and fair-trade clothes.
534.892	It is time to demand fair-trade phones.
539.718	This is an idea worth spreading.
543.113	Thank you.
544.295	(Applause)
