13.149	I have spent my entire life
16.872	either at the schoolhouse,
16.872	on the way to the schoolhouse,
21.197	or talking about what happens
21.197	in the schoolhouse.
23.82	(Laughter)
24.943	Both my parents were educators,
27.255	my maternal grandparents were educators,
30.505	and for the past 40 years,
30.505	I've done the same thing.
34.346	And so, needless to say, over those years
36.712	I've had a chance
36.712	to look at education reform
40.228	from a lot of perspectives.
42.059	Some of those reforms have been good.
44.012	Some of them have been not so good.
46.282	And we know why kids drop out.
48.479	We know why kids don't learn.
49.958	It's either poverty, low attendance,
52.875	negative peer influences...
55.251	We know why.
56.888	But one of the things
56.888	that we never discuss
59.235	or we rarely discuss
61.547	is the value and importance
61.547	of human connection.
65.839	Relationships.
68.076	James Comer says
68.076	that no significant learning
71.674	can occur without
71.674	a significant relationship.
74.873	George Washington Carver says all learning
77.247	is understanding relationships.
81.354	Everyone in this room has been affected
81.354	by a teacher or an adult.
86.946	For years, I have watched people teach.
91.516	I have looked at the best
91.516	and I've looked at some of the worst.
94.898	A colleague said to me one time,
96.72	"""They don't pay me to like the kids."
99.243	They pay me to teach a lesson.
100.832	The kids should learn it.
102.085	I should teach it, they should learn it,
104.015	"Case closed."""
105.929	Well, I said to her,
108.203	"""You know, kids don't learn"
108.203	"from people they don't like."""
111.307	(Laughter)
113.626	(Applause)
119.22	"She said, ""That's just a bunch of hooey."""
122.625	And I said to her,
123.672	"""Well, your year is going to be"
123.672	"long and arduous, dear."""
128.086	Needless to say, it was.
129.577	Some people think that you can either
129.577	have it in you to build a relationship,
133.363	or you don't.
135.084	I think Stephen Covey had the right idea.
137.174	He said you ought to just
137.174	throw in a few simple things,
140.716	like seeking first to understand,
143.021	as opposed to being understood.
145.479	Simple things, like apologizing.
148.366	You ever thought about that?
149.724	Tell a kid you're sorry, they're in shock.
151.904	(Laughter)
153.092	I taught a lesson once on ratios.
155.521	I'm not real good with math,
155.521	but I was working on it.
158.546	(Laughter)
159.712	And I got back and looked
159.712	at that teacher edition.
162.518	I'd taught the whole lesson wrong.
164.346	(Laughter)
165.674	So I came back to class
165.674	the next day and I said,
167.992	"""Look, guys, I need to apologize."
170.224	I taught the whole lesson wrong.
170.224	"I'm so sorry."""
174.07	"They said, ""That's okay, Ms. Pierson."
175.923	"You were so excited, we just let you go."""
182.95	I have had classes that were so low,
187.418	so academically deficient, that I cried.
190.831	"I wondered, ""How am I"
190.831	going to take this group,
193.807	in nine months,
195.878	from where they are
195.878	to where they need to be?
198.529	And it was difficult, it was awfully hard.
202.202	How do I raise the self-esteem of a child
204.703	and his academic achievement
204.703	at the same time?
207.726	One year I came up with a bright idea.
209.792	I told all my students,
211.637	"""You were chosen to be in my class"
215.278	because I am the best teacher
216.826	and you are the best students,
218.372	they put us all together
219.817	so we could show
219.817	"everybody else how to do it."""
223.382	"One of the students said, ""Really?"""
225.291	(Laughter)
227.575	"I said, ""Really. We have"
227.575	to show the other classes
230.598	how to do it, so when
230.598	we walk down the hall,
233.058	people will notice us,
233.058	so you can't make noise.
235.609	"You just have to strut."""
237.243	(Laughter)
238.46	And I gave them a saying to say:
240.136	"""I am somebody."
241.428	I was somebody when I came.
242.793	I'll be a better somebody when I leave.
244.717	I am powerful, and I am strong.
246.71	I deserve the education that I get here.
249.4	I have things to do, people to impress,
251.792	"and places to go."""
253.564	"And they said, ""Yeah!"""
254.808	(Laughter)
256.336	You say it long enough,
257.756	it starts to be a part of you.
261.189	(Applause)
268.01	I gave a quiz, 20 questions.
271.786	A student missed 18.
274.625	"I put a ""+2"" on his paper"
274.625	and a big smiley face.
277.951	(Laughter)
279.528	"He said, ""Ms. Pierson, is this an F?"""
283.276	"I said, ""Yes."""
284.632	(Laughter)
285.902	"He said, ""Then why'd you"
285.902	"put a smiley face?"""
289.081	"I said, ""Because you're on a roll."
291.329	You got two right.
291.329	"You didn't miss them all."""
294.214	(Laughter)
295.401	"I said, ""And when we review this,"
295.401	"won't you do better?"""
298.82	"He said, ""Yes, ma'am, I can do better."""
301.349	"You see, ""-18"" sucks"
301.349	all the life out of you.
304.981	"""+2"" said, ""I ain't all bad."""
312.999	For years, I watched my mother
312.999	take the time at recess to review,
319.062	go on home visits in the afternoon,
321.894	buy combs and brushes
321.894	and peanut butter and crackers
324.653	to put in her desk drawer
324.653	for kids that needed to eat,
327.387	and a washcloth and some soap
327.387	for the kids who didn't smell so good.
330.65	See, it's hard to teach kids who stink.
332.936	(Laughter)
334.323	And kids can be cruel.
336.827	And so she kept those things in her desk,
339.403	and years later, after she retired,
342.928	I watched some of those
342.928	same kids come through
345.545	"and say to her, ""You know, Ms. Walker,"
347.529	you made a difference in my life.
350.044	You made it work for me.
351.28	You made me feel like I was somebody,
353.318	when I knew, at the bottom, I wasn't.
356.705	And I want you to just
356.705	"see what I've become."""
358.832	And when my mama died two years ago at 92,
361.955	there were so many former
361.955	students at her funeral,
365.159	it brought tears to my eyes,
365.159	not because she was gone,
367.873	but because she left
367.873	a legacy of relationships
371.28	that could never disappear.
373.788	Can we stand to have more relationships?
377.535	Absolutely.
378.714	Will you like all your children?
378.714	Of course not.
381.848	(Laughter)
383.126	And you know your toughest
383.126	kids are never absent.
387.048	(Laughter)
389.041	Never.
390.681	You won't like them all,
392.139	and the tough ones show up for a reason.
395.549	It's the connection.
395.549	It's the relationships.
404.23	So teachers become
404.23	great actors and great actresses,
408.021	and we come to work
408.021	when we don't feel like it,
410.284	and we're listening to policy
410.284	that doesn't make sense,
413.334	and we teach anyway.
416.515	We teach anyway,
416.515	because that's what we do.
420.579	Teaching and learning should bring joy.
423.818	How powerful would our world be
426.279	if we had kids who were
426.279	not afraid to take risks,
430.029	who were not afraid to think,
431.434	and who had a champion?
432.79	Every child deserves a champion,
435.255	an adult who will never give up on them,
437.465	who understands the power of connection,
440.457	and insists that they become
440.457	the best that they can possibly be.
444.37	Is this job tough? You betcha.
446.618	Oh God, you betcha.
448.861	But it is not impossible.
452.095	We can do this. We're educators.
453.852	We're born to make a difference.
456.136	Thank you so much.
457.527	(Applause)
