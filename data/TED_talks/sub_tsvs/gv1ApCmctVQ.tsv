15.26	Cholera was reported in Haiti
17.26	for the first time in over 50 years
19.26	last October.
21.26	There was no way to predict
23.26	how far it would spread through water supplies
26.26	and how bad the situation would get.
29.26	And not knowing where help was needed
31.26	always ensured that help was in short supply
34.26	in the areas that needed it most.
37.26	We've gotten good at predicting and preparing for storms
40.26	before they take innocent lives
42.26	and cause irreversible damage,
44.26	but we still can't do that with water,
46.26	and here's why.
48.26	Right now, if you want to test water in the field,
50.26	you need a trained technician,
52.26	expensive equipment like this,
54.26	and you have to wait about a day
56.26	for chemical reactions to take place and provide results.
59.26	It's too slow
61.26	to get a picture of conditions on the ground
63.26	before they change,
65.26	too expensive to implement
67.26	in all the places that require testing.
69.26	And it ignores the fact that, in the meanwhile,
71.26	people still need to drink water.
73.26	Most of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak
76.26	didn't come from testing water;
78.26	it came from forms like this,
80.26	which documented all the people
82.26	we failed to help.
84.26	Countless lives have been saved
86.26	by canaries in coalmines --
88.26	a simple and invaluable way
90.26	for miners to know whether they're safe.
92.26	I've been inspired by that simplicity as I've been working on this problem
95.26	with some of the most hardworking and brilliant people I've ever known.
98.26	We think there's a simpler solution to this problem --
100.26	one that can be used
102.26	by people who face conditions like this everyday.
104.26	It's in its early stages,
106.26	but this is what it looks like right now.
109.26	We call it the Water Canary.
111.26	It's a fast, cheap device
114.26	that answers an important question:
116.26	Is this water contaminated?
118.26	It doesn't require any special training.
121.26	And instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place,
124.26	it uses light.
126.26	That means there's no waiting
128.26	for chemical reactions to take place,
130.26	no need to use reagents that can run out
132.26	and no need to be an expert
134.26	to get actionable information.
137.26	To test water, you simply insert a sample
139.26	and, within seconds,
141.26	it either displays a red light, indicating contaminated water,
144.26	or a green light, indicating the sample is safe.
146.26	This will make it possible
148.26	for anyone to collect life-saving information
151.26	and to monitor water quality conditions as they unfold.
154.26	We're also, on top of that,
157.26	integrating wireless networking
160.26	into an affordable device
162.26	with GPS and GSM.
164.26	What that means is that each reading can be automatically transmitted to servers
167.26	to be mapped in real time.
169.26	With enough users,
171.26	maps like this will make it possible
173.26	to take preventive action,
175.26	containing hazards before they turn into emergencies
178.26	that take years to recover from.
180.26	And then, instead of taking days
182.26	to disseminate this information to the people who need it most,
184.26	it can happen automatically.
187.26	We've seen how distributed networks,
189.26	big data and information
191.26	can transform society.
193.26	I think it's time for us to apply them to water.
196.26	Our goal over the next year is to get Water Canary ready for the field
198.26	and to open-source the hardware
200.26	so that anyone can contribute to the development and the evaluation,
203.26	so we can tackle this problem together.
205.26	Thank you.
207.26	(Applause)
