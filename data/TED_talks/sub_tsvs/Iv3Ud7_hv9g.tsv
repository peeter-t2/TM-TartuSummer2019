12.94	[Yoruba: Freeborn Ijebu-Ode son,]
16.74	[of true Ogbogbo Clan,]
21.46	[whose wealth and resources
21.46	surpass all that Europe ever had,]
24.46	[whose altar is filled with gold.]
30.18	This chant is called the oríkì.
32.42	My grandmother used to sing it
32.42	to me when I was a child in Nigeria.
37.82	See, an oríkì is the song of praise
37.82	of the Yoruba people,
41.06	and this particularly speaks
41.06	of treasures that the West does not have.
46.66	Mama -- that's what
46.66	I call my grandmother --
48.78	told me many stories
48.78	about Yoruba mythology.
51.82	You see, the Yorubas are an ethnic group
51.82	from the southwestern part of Nigeria,
55.78	and I was always fascinated
55.78	by these stories.
57.94	I was always intrigued.
59.74	And Yoruba culture has inspired
59.74	my art since I was a child.
63.26	You see, African art is not just what
63.26	you buy at Harlem markets in New York.
67.34	Every artist has a name,
70.42	and every artist has a story.
72.5	This is my story.
75.46	See, mama had tattoos
75.46	on her arms and her legs.
79.1	As a child, I thought
79.1	she was born with them,
81.38	with beautiful black lines
81.38	and detailed symbols.
84.06	And then she told me
85.34	that they were actually symbols
85.34	from the Yoruba mythology.
89.14	I never knew how this was going
89.14	to influence the artist that I am today.
93.34	You see, as a young child,
93.34	I saw art everywhere.
95.78	I remember the house we lived in
95.78	in Ilorin, in Stadium Road.
99.54	We had marble floors,
101.14	and you know, I would look
101.14	at the marble floors,
103.74	and I would see all sorts
103.74	of patterns and designs in it,
106.42	and I thought everybody could see them.
108.34	So I would call my brother,
108.34	and I would be like,
110.62	"""Ikeolu, come and see this marble design,"
110.62	"see this pattern, see this mask."""
114.18	And he would tell me,
114.18	"""Laolu, I don't see anything."""
116.66	So I would use ink, and I would trace out
116.66	what I saw on the floor.
119.78	And then when my mom noticed,
119.78	she got really upset.
122.38	(Laughter)
123.98	But that didn't stop me.
125.26	I switched from ink to chalk,
126.94	because I got in trouble a lot
126.94	with my teachers and my parents.
129.94	So I remember my mom said,
129.94	"""Laolu, we are Christians."
132.86	Why don't you draw like other people?
134.7	Why don't you draw landscapes
134.7	or maybe you draw chairs or furniture,
139.02	"or maybe even draw Jesus?"""
141.22	You know, I could paint
141.22	the whole house if I had a chance,
143.98	but when I grew up,
143.98	I knew being an artist was not an option,
146.94	so I wanted to be the person
146.94	my parents wanted me to be,
149.94	so I went to law school.
151.54	Of course, that's my dad there.
151.54	He was so proud that day.
155.34	And this was what my notebooks
155.34	looked like in law school.
158.66	(Laughter)
161.26	Of course I would miss classes,
162.79	and I would make up excuses
162.79	why I wasn't going to class.
166.98	But when I started working
166.98	at the Human Rights Commission
169.7	as a human rights attorney,
171.06	my mind was elsewhere.
173.14	I saw a very tough reality.
175.94	I worked with children
177.22	who had to choose
177.22	between getting an education
180.06	and actually being forced into marriage.
182.78	I was so frustrated
182.78	seeing all the injustice around me,
186.38	and my only outlet was art,
187.98	so I started painting.
189.98	"This piece is called ""Dreamscape."""
191.86	So when you zoom into this piece,
193.5	you're going to see a girl child
195.9	and the accidental birth,
197.78	the fact that our future
197.78	is controlled by where we are born.
203.14	Now, the next one you see
203.14	a man and a man holding hands,
206.94	a woman and a woman holding hands.
208.82	You see, in Nigeria,
208.82	same-sex relationship is criminalized.
212.98	You can actually get 14 years for that.
215.5	With my art, I like to tell stories.
217.54	Through my art,
217.54	I like to start a conversation.
219.78	So in this one, you see the map of Africa,
222.02	you see the questions, you see crying,
223.9	and there you see syringes
223.9	plugged into Africa
226.1	and the natural resources
226.1	being drained out.
228.22	So I asked myself, where does it go?
230.78	Who benefits from all of this?
233.46	You see, with my art,
234.74	the way I weave my art around
234.74	the patterns, the masks, the stories,
238.62	and the way I use my lines,
239.98	it's all from the Yoruba culture.
241.74	So in 2013, I made a big gamble.
244.3	I quit my job and I moved to New York City
244.3	to practice art full time.
248.66	Of course, my parents were like,
250.26	"""Oh, [it's just a phase.]"
250.26	"He'll come back."""
252.94	But life as an artist
252.94	in New York was not easy,
255.94	because I was broke,
257.98	no money, no gallery agents,
257.98	no representation,
260.94	so no gallery would show my work.
262.58	So I thought to myself, I need to survive.
264.74	So I started painting on clothes
264.74	to make a living.
268.339	I started painting on shoes.
270.339	I started customizing things for people.
272.659	And then soon I realized the power,
274.38	because people were so proud
274.38	to wear their stories.
278.06	So I started painting on everything.
280.02	I painted on guitars,
281.58	I started doing murals,
282.82	anything I could find
282.82	my hand on I painted,
284.9	and everything became my canvas.
286.74	So one day, I was just going
286.74	on my Instagram feed,
290.06	and I saw this picture.
291.54	It was Reign. She took a picture
291.54	standing in front my art,
294.66	and the moment I saw that photo,
296.42	something happened in that moment.
298.1	I could actually see my artwork
298.1	go into her and come out of her literally,
302.54	and that's how I started painting
302.54	on human bodies.
306.74	As a child I saw art on the marble floors,
309.62	I saw art on walls,
311.26	but now I see art on people's faces
311.26	and people's bodies.
314.74	I remember my grandmother,
316.78	and I realized that
316.78	most of my creative instincts
319.66	were actually based
319.66	on my childhood memories
322.74	and the art on my grandmother's skin.
325.14	Now I look at all the people I painted,
325.14	and I think to myself, like,
328.38	what would it look like
328.38	if we all walked around
330.62	like gods and goddesses
330.62	from Yoruba mythology?
332.82	And boom, that's how
332.82	The Sacred Art of the Ori was born.
335.62	You see, Ori in Yoruba mythology
338.14	means your soul, it means your essence,
338.14	it means your instincts.
341.22	And I realized that only
341.22	when you tap into your Ori,
343.74	then you can actually move mountains.
346.3	So there's something so immediate
346.3	about painting on human bodies.
351.46	It's like art in motion.
354.3	It's like a 3D experience.
356.38	So one day, I was just doing
356.38	my regular work in Brooklyn,
361.18	and I got an email that said,
362.9	"""Hi, I'm a big fan of your work."
365.22	Would you like to paint
365.22	for my music video?
367.261	"Signed, Beyoncé."""
368.54	Like, Beyoncé emailed me.
370.02	I was like, what?
371.38	(Laughter)
373.06	I was like, what,
373.06	how did she even know me?
375.14	I thought this can't be true.
375.14	Of course I thought it was a scam.
378.18	The Nigerian in me was like, nah.
379.82	(Laughter)
381.06	(Applause)
383.22	But incredibly enough,
383.22	it was real, it was true,
385.7	and things happened really fast.
387.3	You see, Beyoncé wanted
387.3	to pay homage to New Orleans,
389.82	and my art reminded her
389.82	of her creole origins.
393.1	"So when ""Lemonade"" dropped, of course,"
395.46	boom, everything just went
395.46	from zero to 100 real fast.
400.02	People featured me in magazines,
402.42	interviews.
403.66	People stopped me in the street.
405.26	People knew my name, like --
406.74	And sometimes I had to step back
408.34	and just chill,
408.34	and, like, take everything in.
411.42	You know, as artists,
411.42	we work so hard all our lives
413.86	for our art to be recognized,
415.3	and for this I feel blessed.
417.06	However, the attorney
417.06	in me is still there,
419.14	so I use my art
419.14	to fight for what I believe in.
422.98	My Yoruba heritage is always there.
425.62	I'd like to share with you tonight
425.62	some of my art in motion.
430.58	Please, welcome with me on stage.
432.94	(Music)
434.7	(Applause)
449.18	Now, this is Geli, and this is Reign.
452.62	These are the first two people
452.62	I ever painted in my life,
455.94	and I spent the past day painting on them.
459.7	Tonight, they represent
459.7	my hopes and my fears.
463.78	Now, I put my fears on the back.
468.66	I put my hopes in front.
472.7	What are my hopes?
476.26	I hope that people know
477.54	that Africa is not just
477.54	one huge, nameless continent
481.78	that is all the same.
483.38	I also hope that people know
484.78	that in Nigeria, we have
484.78	over 350 ethnic groups and languages,
490.78	and I am just one artist from one of them.
493.54	(Applause)
498.22	I also hope that you know
498.22	that I hope I will be able to change
501.22	the way people talk about African art
501.22	on the continent and here,
505.22	and I hope you know that African art
506.98	is not just what you buy
506.98	at Harlem markets in New York
510.5	and that every piece of art
510.5	you see has a story,
513.38	and every artist has a name.
515.02	Thank you very much.
516.26	(Applause)
