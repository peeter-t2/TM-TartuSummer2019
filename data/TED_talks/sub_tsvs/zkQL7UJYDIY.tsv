16.592	So I tried to do a small good thing for my wife.
20.677	It makes me to stand here,
23.039	the fame, the money I got out of it.
25.693	So what I did, I'd gone back to my early marriage days.
29.226	What you did in the early marriage days,
31.155	you tried to impress your wife. I did the same.
33.974	On that occasion, I found my wife
36.809	carrying something like this.
38.98	"I saw. ""What is that?"" I asked."
41.22	"My wife replied, ""None of your business."""
44.489	Then, being her husband, I ran behind her
46.58	and saw she had a nasty rag cloth.
48.116	I don't even use that cloth to clean my two-wheeler.
51.084	Then I understood this -- adapting that unhygienic method
53.886	to manage her period days.
56.187	Then I immediately asked her, why are you [using] that unhygienic method?
57.972	She replied, I also know about [sanitary pads],
61.51	but myself and my sisters, if they start using that,
64.585	we have to cut our family milk budget.
67.169	Then I was shocked. What is the connection between
68.488	using a sanitary pad and a milk budget?
69.953	And it's called affordability.
72.443	I tried to impress my new wife by offering her a packet of sanitary pads.
76.765	I went to a local shop, I tried to buy her a sanitary pad packet.
79.926	That fellow looks left and right,
81.519	and spreads a newspaper, rolls it into the newspaper,
83.96	gives it to me like a banned item, something like that.
87.744	I don't know why. I did not ask for a condom.
91.543	Then I took that pad. I want to see that. What is inside it?
95.664	The very first time, at the age of 29,
99.619	that day I am touching the sanitary pad, first ever.
101.694	I must know: How many of the guys here have touched a sanitary pad?
106.754	They are not going to touch that, because it's not your matter.
111.394	Then I thought to myself, white substance, made of cotton --
114.622	oh my God, that guy is just using a penny value of raw material --
117.963	inside they are selling for pounds, dollars.
120.517	Why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife?
125.331	That's how all this started, but after making a sanitary pad,
128.34	where can I check it?
129.736	It's not like I can just check it in the lab.
132.962	I need a woman volunteer. Where can I get one in India?
135.912	Even in Bangalore you won't get [one], in India.
139.492	So only problem: the only available victim is my wife.
144.896	Then I made a sanitary pad and handed it to Shanti -- my wife's name is Shanti.
149.496	"""Close your eyes. Whatever I give,"
150.8	it will be not a diamond pendant
152.412	not a diamond ring, even a chocolate,
153.961	I will give you a surprise with a lot of tinsel paper rolled up with it.
157.465	"Close your eyes."""
159.416	Because I tried to make it intimate.
162.49	Because it's an arranged marriage, not a love marriage.
165.701	(Laughter)
168.22	So one day she said, openly, I'm not going to support this research.
171.799	Then other victims, they got into my sisters.
174.915	But even sisters, wives, they're not ready to support in the research.
178.312	That's why I am always jealous with the saints in India.
181.354	They are having a lot of women volunteers around them.
184.913	Why I am not getting [any]?
186.609	You know, without them even calling, they'll get a lot of women volunteers.
194.697	Then I used, tried to use the medical college girls.
197.78	They also refused. Finally, I decide,
200.389	use sanitary pad myself.
203.24	Now I am having a title like
205.371	the first man to set foot on the moon.
209.548	Armstrong. Then Tenzing [and] Hillary, in Everest,
212.716	like that Muruganantham is the first man
214.605	wore a sanitary pad across the globe.
218.517	I wore a sanitary pad. I filled animal blood in a football bottle,
221.781	I tied it up here, there is a tube going into my panties,
224.467	while I'm walking, while I'm cycling, I made a press,
227.091	doses of blood will go there.
229.407	That makes me bow down to any woman in front of me
233.435	to give full respect. That five days I'll never forget --
236.413	the messy days, the lousy days, that wetness.
239.069	My God, it's unbelievable.
244.723	But here the problem is, one company is making napkin
249.484	out of cotton. It is working well.
251.9	But I am also trying to make sanitary pad with the good cotton. It's not working.
254.908	That makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research.
258.492	You need first funds.
260.193	Not only financial crises, but because of the sanitary pad research,
263.511	I come through all sorts of problems, including
267.227	a divorce notice from my wife.
269.63	Why is this? I used medical college girls.
272.725	She suspects I am using as a trump card
275.579	to run behind medical college girls.
278.035	Finally, I came to know it is a special cellulose
281.278	derived from a pinewood, but even after that,
283.686	you need a multimillion-dollar plant like this
285.688	to process that material. Again, a stop-up.
289.05	Then I spend another four years to create my own
292.812	machine tools, a simple machine tool like this.
295.475	In this machine, any rural woman can apply the same
298.719	raw materials that they are processing in the multinational plant,
301.563	anyone can make a world-class napkin at your dining hall.
305.255	That is my invention.
308.472	So after that, what I did,
311.195	usually if anyone got a patent or an invention,
314.658	immediately you want to make, convert into this.
318.201	I never did this. I dropped it just like this,
321.251	because you do this, if anyone runs after money,
324.835	their life will not [have] any beauty. It is boredom.
328.552	A lot of people making a lot of money, billion,
330.563	billions of dollars accumulating.
332.717	Why are they coming for, finally, for philanthropy?
334.963	Why the need for accumulating money, then doing philanthropy?
338.48	What if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one?
341.789	That's why I am giving this machine
345.337	only in rural India, for rural women, because in India,
349.275	[you'll be] surprised, only two percent of women
351.751	are using sanitary pads. The rest, they're using a rag cloth,
355.092	a leaf, husk, [saw] dust, everything except sanitary pads.
358.952	It is the same in the 21st century. That's why I am going
361.339	to decide to give this machine only for poor women across India.
364.88	So far, 630 installations happened in 23 states
368.261	in six other countries.
370.897	Now I'm on my seventh year sustaining against
375.379	multinational, transnational giants -- makes all MBA students a question mark.
380.397	A school dropout from Coimbatore, how he is able to sustaining?
383.682	That makes me a visiting professor and guest lecturer in all IIMs.
389.782	(Applause)
394.945	Play video one.
397.79	"(Video) Arunachalam Muruganantham: The thing I saw in my wife's hand, ""Why are you using that nasty cloth?"""
402.962	"She replied immediately, ""I know about napkins, but if I start"
407.275	"using napkins, then we have to cut our family milk budget."""
411.174	Why not make myself a low-cost napkin?
415.595	So I decided I'm going to sell this new machine
418.376	only for Women Self Help Groups.
425.236	That is my idea.
429.689	AM: And previously, you need a multimillion investment
434.404	for machine and all. Now, any rural woman can.
437.904	They are performing puja.
439.773	(Video): (Singing)
456.787	You just think, competing giants,
461.373	even from Harvard, Oxford, is difficult.
463.264	I make a rural woman to compete with multinationals.
466.148	I'm sustaining on seventh year.
467.718	Already 600 installations. What is my mission?
469.979	I'm going to make India
471.84	[into] a 100-percent-sanitary-napkin-using country in my lifetime.
475.844	In this way I'm going to provide not less than a million
477.829	rural employment that I'm going to create.
479.887	That's why I'm not running after this bloody money.
483.443	I'm doing something serious.
484.943	If you chase a girl, the girl won't like you.
489.292	Do your job simply, the girl will chase you.
491.69	Like that, I never chased Mahalakshmi.
494.041	Mahalakshmi is chasing me, I am keeping in the back pocket.
498.911	Not in front pocket. I'm a back pocket man.
503.367	That's all. A school dropout saw your problem in the society
506.939	of not using sanitary pad.
508.971	I am becoming a solution provider. I'm very happy.
511.271	I don't want to make this as a corporate entity.
514.114	I want to make this as a local sanitary pad movement
518.117	across the globe. That's why I put all the details
520.97	on public domain like an open software.
524.334	Now 110 countries are accessing it. Okay?
528.896	So I classify the people into three:
532.896	uneducated, little educated, surplus educated.
539.818	Little educated, done this. Surplus educated,
543.709	what are you going to do for the society?
545.113	Thank you very much. Bye!
548.88	(Applause)
