12.408	So imagine that a plane is about to crash
18.17	with 250 children and babies,
20.971	and if you knew how to stop that, would you?
24.39	Now imagine
26.361	that 60 planes full of babies under five
30	crash every single day.
33.21	That's the number of kids
34.982	that never make it to their fifth birthday.
37.307	6.6 million children
40.547	never make it to their fifth birthday.
44.138	Most of these deaths are preventable,
46.594	and that doesn't just make me sad,
48.562	it makes me angry,
50.258	and it makes me determined.
52.616	Diarrhea and pneumonia
54.506	are among the top two killers
56.322	of children under five,
58.64	and what we can do to prevent these diseases
60.896	isn't some smart,
63.076	new technological innovations.
65.993	It's one of the world's oldest inventions:
70.872	a bar of soap.
74.397	Washing hands with soap,
75.829	a habit we all take for granted,
78.2	can reduce diarrhea by half,
80.484	can reduce respiratory infections by one third.
84.14	Handwashing with soap
85.911	can have an impact
87.56	on reducing flu, trachoma, SARS,
92.587	and most recently in the case of cholera
94.977	and Ebola outbreak,
97.667	one of the key interventions
99.358	is handwashing with soap.
102.176	Handwashing with soap keeps kids in school.
105.431	It stops babies from dying.
108.254	Handwashing with soap
110.127	is one of the most cost-effective
112.924	ways of saving children's lives.
115.47	It can save over 600,000 children every year.
119.126	That's the equivalent of stopping
124.07	full of babies and children
125.998	from crashing every single day.
128.709	I think you'll agree with me that that's a pretty
131.133	useful public health intervention.
134.415	So now just take a minute.
137.365	I think you need to get to
137.365	know the person next to you.
139.301	Why don't you just shake their hands.
141.249	Please shake their hands.
143.493	All right, get to know each other.
144.793	They look really pretty.
146.328	All right.
148.101	So what if I told you
150.399	that the person whose hands you just shook
152.984	actually didn't wash their hands
154.692	when they were coming out of the toilet?
154.692	(Laughter)
157.35	They don't look so pretty anymore, right?
160.68	Pretty yucky, you would agree with me.
163.836	Well, statistics are actually showing
165.501	that four people out of five
167.917	don't wash their hands when
167.917	they come out of the toilet,
170.525	globally.
172.213	And the same way,
174.483	we don't do it when we've got fancy toilets,
177.227	running water, and soap available,
179.677	it's the same thing in the countries
181.611	where child mortality is really high.
184.985	What is it? Is there no soap?
187.299	Actually, soap is available.
189.548	In 90 percent of households in India,
195.883	you will find soap.
197.363	Even in countries where soap is the lowest,
201.2	like Ethiopia, we are at 50 percent.
204.779	So why is it?
206.006	Why aren't people washing their hands?
208.939	Why is it that Mayank,
211.323	this young boy that I met in India,
213.59	isn't washing his hands?
215.335	Well, in Mayank's family,
217.947	soap is used for bathing,
220.379	soap is used for laundry,
222.371	soap is used for washing dishes.
225.24	His parents think sometimes
227.107	it's a precious commodity,
228.671	so they'll keep it in a cupboard.
230.938	They'll keep it away from him so he doesn't waste it.
233.692	On average, in Mayank's family,
236.242	they will use soap for washing hands
238.314	once a day
239.765	at the very best, and sometimes
242.13	even once a week for washing hands with soap.
245.115	What's the result of that?
247.33	Children pick up disease
249.195	in the place that's supposed to love them
250.87	and protect them the most, in their homes.
255.778	Think about where you learned to wash your hands.
258.326	Did you learn to wash your hands at home?
261.13	Did you learn to wash your hands in school?
263.906	I think behavioral scientists will tell you
266.386	that it's very difficult to change the habits
268.925	that you have had early in life.
273.81	However, we all copy what everyone else does,
276.607	and local cultural norms are something
279.331	that shape how we change our behavior,
282.642	and this is where the private sector comes in.
285.418	Every second in Asia and Africa,
292.14	will buy this bar to protect their family.
295.858	Many women in India will tell you
297.898	they learned all about hygiene, diseases,
300.124	from this bar of soap from Lifebuoy brand.
303.87	Iconic brands like this one
305.745	have a responsibility to do good
307.633	in the places where they sell their products.
310.114	It's that belief, plus the scale of Unilever,
313.289	that allows us to keep talking about
315.729	handwashing with soap and
315.729	hygiene to these mothers.
319.545	Big businesses and brands can change
322.817	and shift those social norms
324.969	and make a difference for those habits
326.881	that are so stubborn.
329.061	Think about it:
330.319	Marketeers spend all their time
333.824	making us switch from one brand to the other.
338.18	And actually, they know how to transform
341.17	science and facts into compelling messages.
344.203	Just for a minute, imagine
346.099	when they put all their forces behind
348.84	a message as powerful as handwashing with soap.
351.79	The profit motive is transforming health outcomes
354.749	in this world.
356.627	But it's been happening for centuries:
358.446	the Lifebuoy brand was launched in 1894
361.979	in Victorian England
363.715	to actually combat cholera.
365.987	Last week, I was in Ghana
368.291	with the minister of health,
369.83	because if you don't know,
371.049	there's a cholera outbreak in Ghana at the moment.
373.706	A hundred and eighteen years later,
375.842	the solution is exactly the same:
377.762	It's about ensuring that they have access
380.258	to this bar of soap,
381.674	and that they're using it,
383.419	because that's the number one way
385.379	to actually stop cholera from spreading.
388.61	I think this drive for profit
391.01	is extremely powerful,
392.881	sometimes more powerful than
394.341	the most committed charity or government.
397.636	Government is doing what they can,
399.438	especially in terms of the pandemics
402.813	and epidemics such as cholera,
405.35	or Ebola at the moment,
406.805	but with competing priorities.
409.345	The budget is not always there.
411.85	And when you think about this,
413.713	you think about what is required
415.82	to make handwashing a daily habit,
418.141	it requires sustained funding
421.962	to refine this behavior.
425.07	In short, those that fight for public health
429.503	are actually dependent upon the soap companies
432.267	to keep promoting handwashing with soap.
435.263	We have friends like USAID,
438.505	the Global Public-Private Partnership
438.505	for Handwashing with Soap,
441.81	London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,
443.97	Plan, WaterAid,
445.539	that all believe
447.046	for a win-win-win partnership.
450.761	Win for the public sector,
452.746	because we help them reach their targets.
455.821	Win for the private sector,
458.209	because we build new generations
459.623	of future handwashers.
461.42	And most importantly,
463.633	win for the most vulnerable.
466.24	On October 15,
468.296	we will celebrate Global Handwashing Day.
470.648	Schools, communities,
472.368	our friends in the public sector
474.248	and our friends in the private sector —
476.864	yes, on that day even our competitors,
479.144	we all join hands to celebrate
481.13	the world's most important
483.112	public health intervention.
485.16	What's required,
486.385	and again where the private sector
486.385	can make a huge difference,
489.121	is coming up with this big, creative thinking
492.887	that drives advocacy.
495.128	If you take our Help a Child Reach 5 campaign,
497.791	we've created great films
500.77	that bring the message of handwashing with soap
502.856	to the everyday person
504.551	in a way that can relate to them.
507.127	We've had over 30 million views.
508.887	Most of these discussions are still happening online.
511.414	I urge you to take five minutes
512.886	and look at those films.
516.943	I come from Mali,
518.472	one of the world's poorest countries.
520.815	I grew up in a family where every dinner conversation
523.551	was around social justice.
525.729	I trained in Europe's premier school of public health.
529.257	I think I'm probably one of the only women
530.985	in my country with this high degree in health,
534.426	and the only one
535.91	with a doctorate in handwashing with soap.
539.512	(Laughter)
541.248	(Applause)
547.872	Nine years ago, I decided,
550.223	with a successful public health career in the making,
553.136	that I could make the biggest impact coming,
556.664	selling and promoting the world's best invention
559.695	in public health: soap.
562.23	We run today the world's largest
564.359	handwashing program
565.73	by any public health standards.
568.308	We've reached over 183 million people
571.78	in 16 countries.
574.97	My team and I have the ambition
576.806	to reach one billion by 2020.
580.564	Over the last four years,
582.758	business has grown double digits,
585.486	whilst child mortality has reduced
587.423	in all the places where soap use has increased.
591.845	It may be uncomfortable for some to hear —
594.15	business growth and lives saved
596.405	somehow equated in the same sentence —
599.918	but it is that business growth
601.837	that allows us to keep doing more.
604.133	Without it, and without talking about it,
606.877	we cannot achieve the change that we need.
610.925	Last week, my team and I
613.11	spent time visiting mothers
616.406	that have all experienced the same thing:
618.917	the death of a newborn.
621.349	I'm a mom. I can't imagine anything more powerful
624.349	and more painful.
627.262	This one is from Myanmar.
629.894	She had the most beautiful smile,
631.9	the smile, I think, that life gives you
634.11	when you've had a second chance.
636.497	Her son, Myo, is her second one.
639.831	She had a daughter
641.735	who passed away at three weeks,
644.127	and we know that the majority
646.48	of children that actually die
647.82	die in the first month of their life,
649.686	and we know that if we give a bar of soap
652.554	to every skilled birth attendant,
654.814	and that if soap is used 
654.814	before touching the babies,
657.364	we can reduce and make a change
658.606	in terms of those numbers.
660.65	And that's what inspires me,
662.518	inspires me to continue in this mission,
664.75	to know that I can equip her
667.134	with what's needed
668.939	so that she can do
670.79	the most beautiful job in the world:
672.854	nurturing her newborn.
674.98	And next time you think of a gift
677.285	for a new mom and her family,
679.375	don't look far: buy her soap.
682.165	It's the most beautiful invention in public health.
685.373	I hope you will join us
687.749	and make handwashing part of your daily lives
690.701	and our daily lives
692.405	and help more children like Myo
694.629	reach their fifth birthday.
695.757	Thank you.
698.164	(Applause)
