15.57	Let's begin with a story.
19.586	Once upon a time --
21.537	well actually less than two years ago --
24.603	in a kingdom not so very far away,
27.636	there was a man
29.387	who traveled many miles
31.254	to come to work at the jewel in the kingdom's crown --
34.836	an internationally famous company.
37.42	Let's call it Island Networks.
40.538	Now this kingdom had many resources
43.386	and mighty ambitions,
45.603	but the one thing it lacked was people.
48.17	And so it invited workers from around the world
51.603	to come and help it build the nation.
54.253	But in order to enter and to stay
57.22	these migrants had to pass a few tests.
60.755	And so it was, our man presented himself
63.238	to authorities in the kingdom,
65.007	looking forward to settling into his new life.
68.205	But then something unexpected happened.
71.455	The medical personnel who took blood samples from the man
75.055	never actually told him what they were testing for.
78.738	He wasn't offered counseling before or after the test,
83.007	which is best medical practice.
85.338	He was never informed of the results of the test.
88.339	And yet, a couple of weeks later,
90.455	he was picked up and taken to prison
93.489	where he was subjected to a medical exam,
96.023	including a full-body search
98.774	in full view of the others in the cell.
102.372	He was released, but then a day or two later,
106.139	he was taken to the airport and he was deported.
111.108	What on earth did this man do
114.373	to merit this treatment?
116.523	What was his terrible crime?
119.125	He was infected with HIV.
122.773	Now the kingdom is one of about 50 countries
125.904	that imposes restrictions on the entry or stay
130.176	of people living with HIV.
132.776	The kingdom argues
134.377	that its laws allow it to detain or deport foreigners
139.577	who pose a risk to the economy
142.276	or the security or the public health
145.776	or the morals of the state.
147.893	But these laws, when applied to people living with HIV,
151.726	are a violation of international human rights agreements
155.108	to which these countries are signatories.
158.328	But you know what?
159.576	Matters of principle aside,
161.059	practically speaking, these laws drive HIV underground.
166.044	People are less likely to come forth
168.642	to be tested or treated or to disclose their condition,
172.676	none of which helps these individuals
175.508	or the communities these laws purport to protect.
179.677	Today we can prevent the transmission of HIV.
183.742	And with treatment, it is a manageable condition.
187.161	We are very far from the days
189.992	when the only practical response to dread disease
193.178	was to have banished the afflicted --
195.758	"like this, ""The Exile of the Leper."""
198.66	So you tell me why, in our age of science,
201.877	we still have laws and policies
204.443	which come from an age of superstition.
207.726	Time for a quick show of hands.
210.993	Who here has been touched by HIV --
214.258	either because you yourself have the virus
217.342	or you have a family member or a friend or a colleague
220.827	who is living with HIV?
222.86	Hands up.
223.96	Wow. Wow.
225.941	That's a significant number of us.
228.86	You know better than anyone
231.392	that HIV brings out
233.659	the best and the worst in humanity.
237.242	And the laws reflect these attitudes.
239.962	I'm not just talking about laws on the books,
242.642	but laws as they are enforced on the streets
246.009	and laws as they are decided in the courts.
248.942	And I'm not just talking about laws
251.492	as they relate to people living with HIV,
253.861	but people who are at greatest risk of infection --
257.092	people such as those who inject drugs or sex workers
260.86	or men who have sex with men
263.009	or transgendered persons
264.892	or migrants or prisoners.
267.36	And in many parts of the world that includes women and children
270.91	who are especially vulnerable.
272.941	Now there are laws in many parts of the world
275.743	which reflect the best of human nature.
279.175	These laws treat people touched by HIV
282.461	with compassion and acceptance.
285.36	These laws respect universal human rights
288.759	and they are grounded in evidence.
291.443	These laws ensure that people living with HIV
294.576	and those at greatest risk
296.692	are protected from violence and discrimination
300.276	and that they get access to prevention and to treatment.
304.492	Unfortunately, these good laws
307.288	are counter-balanced by a mass
309.424	of really bad law --
312.425	law which is grounded in moral judgement
316.874	and in fear and in misinformation,
319.727	laws which specifically punish people living with HIV
323.826	or those at greatest risk.
325.458	These laws fly in the face of science,
328.225	and they are grounded in prejudice
331.508	and in ignorance and in a rewriting of tradition
335.326	and a selective reading of religion.
338.608	But you know what? You don't have to take my word for it.
341.225	We're going to hear from two people
343.109	who are on the sharp end of the law.
345.642	The first is Nick Rhoades. He's an American.
347.843	And he was convicted under the U.S. State of Iowa's law
351.841	on HIV transmission and exposure --
354.726	neither of which offense he actually committed.
358.178	(Video) Nick Rhoades: If something is against the law
361.376	then that is telling society
362.575	that is unacceptable, that's bad behavior.
365.176	And I think the severity of that punishment
367.746	tells you how bad you are as a person.
371.435	You're a class B felon,
373.925	lifetime sex offender.
376.709	You are a very, very, very bad person.
380.742	And you did a very, very, very bad thing.
384.129	And so that's just programmed into you.
386.684	And you go through the correctional system
389.917	and everyone's telling you the same thing.
391.718	And you're just like, I'm a very bad person.
396.682	Shereen El-Feki: It's not just a question
398.647	of unfair or ineffective laws.
401.746	Some countries have good laws,
403.847	laws which could stem the tide of HIV.
406.497	The problem is that these laws are flouted.
409.597	Because stigma gives unofficial license
412.564	to treat people living with HIV
414.881	or those at greatest risk
416.197	unlike other citizens.
418.531	And this is exactly what happened
420.23	to Helma and Dongo from Namibia.
423.444	(Video) Hilma: I found out
425.171	when I went to the hospital for a pregnancy check-up.
428.116	The nurse announced that every pregnant woman
431.768	must also be tested for HIV that day.
433.863	I took the test and the result showed I was positive.
436.912	That's the day I found out.
439.508	"The nurse said to me, ""Why should you people bcome pregnant"
442.12	when you know you are HIV positive?
443.648	"Why are you pregnant when you are living positive?"""
446.043	I am sure now that is the reason they sterilized me.
449.032	Because I am HIV positive.
454.164	They didn't give the forms to me
457.21	or explain what was in the form.
460.932	The nurse just came with it
463.332	already marked where I had to sign.
465.414	And with the labor pain,
467.358	I didn't have the strength to ask them to read it to me.
474.428	I just signed.
476.972	SE: Hilma and Nick and our man in the kingdom
480.11	are among the 34 million people living with HIV
484.461	according to recent estimates.
486.577	They're the lucky ones
488.445	because they're still alive.
490.129	According to those same estimates,
491.994	in 2010 1.8 million people died
495.978	of AIDS related causes.
498.377	These are terrible and tragic figures.
501.88	But if we look a little more broadly into the statistics,
506.311	we actually see some reason for hope.
509.512	Looking globally, the number of new infections of HIV is declining.
514.912	And looking globally as well,
517.363	deaths are also starting to fall.
520.729	There are many reasons for these positive developments,
522.762	but one of the most remarkable
524.895	is in the increase in the number of people around the world
528.062	on anti-retroviral therapy,
530.245	the medicines they need to keep their HIV in check.
534.378	Now there are still many problems.
536.411	Only about half of the people who need treatment
539.761	are currently receiving it.
541.994	In some parts of the world --
543.846	like here in the Middle East and North Africa --
546.195	new infections are rising and so are deaths.
549.578	And the money, the money we need
552.729	for the global response to HIV,
554.662	that is shrinking.
557.658	But for the first time
559.947	in three decades into this epidemic
563.165	we have a real chance to come to grips with HIV.
567.282	But in order to do that
569.248	we need to tackle an epidemic of really bad law.
573.147	It's for this reason
574.765	that the Global Commission on HIV and the Law,
576.895	of which I'm a member,
578.194	was established by the agencies of the United Nations --
581.26	to look at the ways that legal environments
583.91	are affecting people living with HIV
585.927	and those at greatest risk,
588.061	and to recommend what should be done
589.811	to make the law an ally, not an enemy,
593.047	of the global response to HIV.
595.779	Let me give you just one example
598.128	of the way a legal environment
600.778	can make a positive difference.
603.344	People who inject drugs
606.159	are one of those groups I mentioned.
607.974	They're at high risk of HIV
610.095	through contaminated injection equipment
611.96	and other risk-related behaviors.
614.642	In fact, one in every 10 new infections of HIV
618.324	is among people who inject drugs.
621.058	Now drug use or possession
623.659	is illegal in almost every country.
625.808	But some countries take a harder line on this than others.
630.058	In Thailand people who use drugs,
632.742	or are merely suspected of using drugs,
635.593	are placed in detention centers,
637.459	like the one you see here,
639.376	where they are supposed to clean up.
641.459	There is absolutely no evidence
644.391	to show that throwing people into detention
647.242	cures their drug dependence.
649.575	There is, however, ample evidence
651.742	to show that incarcerating people
653.742	increases their risk of HIV and other infections.
658.96	We know how to reduce HIV transmission and other risks
664.61	in people who inject drugs.
666.375	It's called harm reduction,
668.506	and it involves, among other things,
670.29	providing clean needles and syringes,
673.421	offering opioid substitution therapy
676.256	and other evidence-based treatments
678.522	to reduce drug dependence.
680.772	It involves providing information
683.289	and education and condoms
685.307	to reduce HIV transmission,
688.438	and also providing HIV testing
690.955	and counseling and treatment
692.788	should people become infected.
694.606	Where the legal environment allows for harm reduction
698.139	the results are striking.
700.393	Australia and Switzerland
702.223	were two countries which introduced harm reduction
704.824	very early on in their HIV epidemics,
707.524	and they have a very low rate of HIV
710.543	among injecting drug users.
712.706	The U.S. and Malaysia
715.057	came to harm reduction a little later,
717.607	and they have higher rates of HIV in these populations.
721.574	Thailand and Russia, however,
723.257	have resisted harm reduction
725.159	and have stringent laws
726.891	which punish drug use.
728.457	And hey, surprise,
729.957	very high rates of HIV among people who are injecting drugs.
735.324	At the Global Commission we have studied the evidence,
738.19	and we've heard the experiences
739.941	of over 700 people from 140 countries.
744.274	And the trend? Well the trend is clear.
746.532	Where you criminalize people living with HIV
749.857	or those at greatest risk,
751.223	you fuel the epidemic.
753.972	Now coming up with a vaccine for HIV
758.241	or a cure for AIDS --
759.442	now that's rocket science.
761.94	But changing the law isn't.
763.723	And in fact, a number of countries are starting to make progress
766.436	on a number of points.
768.019	To begin, countries need to review their legislation
772.057	as it touches HIV and vulnerable groups.
775.589	On the back of those reviews,
777.706	governments should repeal laws
779.672	that punish or discriminate against people living with HIV
782.84	or those at greatest risk.
785.057	Repealing a law isn't easy,
787.573	and it's particularly difficult
789.357	when it relates to touchy subjects like drugs and sex.
793.64	But there's plenty you can do while that process is underway.
797.207	One of the key points is to reform the police
801.506	so that they have better practices on the ground.
804.323	So for example, outreach workers
806.078	who are distributing condoms to vulnerable populations
809.078	are not themselves subject to police harassment
812.194	or abuse or arbitrary arrest.
815.144	We can also train judges
816.645	so that they find flexibilities in the law
819.812	and so that they rule on the side of tolerance
822.962	rather than prejudice.
824.861	We can retool prisons
826.379	so that HIV prevention and harm reduction
829.744	is available to prisoners.
831.964	The key to all this is reinforcing civil society.
836.479	Because civil society is key
838.162	to raising awareness among vulnerable groups
841.028	of their legal rights.
842.812	But awareness needs action.
844.429	And so we need to ensure
845.895	that these people who are living with HIV
848.228	or at greatest risk of HIV
849.895	have access to legal services
852.629	and they have equal access to the courts.
855.545	And also important is talking to communities
858.246	so that we change interpretations
860.395	of religious or customary law,
862.895	which is too often used
864.713	to justify punishment and fuel stigma.
868.196	For many of us here
869.444	HIV is not an abstract threat.
872.963	It hits very close to home.
875.462	The law, on the other hand,
877.979	can seem remote, arcane, the stuff of specialists,
882.412	but it isn't.
884.494	Because for those of us who live in democracies,
887.379	or in aspiring democracies,
889.695	the law begins with us.
892.712	Laws that treat people living with HIV
895.645	or those at greatest risk with respect
898.313	start with the way that we treat them ourselves: as equals.
903.161	If we are going to stop the spread of HIV in our lifetime,
907.795	then that is the change we need to spread.
911.462	Thank you.
912.861	(Applause)
