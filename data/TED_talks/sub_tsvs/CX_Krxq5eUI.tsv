16.985	Hi. I'm here to talk about congestion,
19.902	namely road congestion.
21.256	Road congestion is a pervasive phenomenon.
23.517	It exists in basically all of the cities all around the world,
26.377	which is a little bit surprising when you think about it.
28.325	I mean, think about how different cities are, actually.
31.288	I mean, you have the typical European cities,
33.05	with a dense urban core, good public transportation
36.042	mostly, not a lot of road capacity.
38.497	But then, on the other hand, you have the American cities.
40.946	It's moving by itself, okay.
43.737	Anyway, the American cities:
46.743	lots of roads dispersed over large areas,
49.671	almost no public transportation.
51.13	And then you have the emerging world cities,
53.34	with a mixed variety of vehicles,
54.866	mixed land-use patterns, also rather dispersed
57.408	but often with a very dense urban core.
60.007	And traffic planners all around the world have tried
62.409	lots of different measures: dense cities or dispersed cities,
66.063	lots of roads or lots of public transport
68.614	or lots of bike lanes or more information,
71.4	or lots of different things, but nothing seems to work.
75.194	But all of these attempts have one thing in common.
78.197	They're basically attempts at figuring out
80.548	what people should do instead of rush hour car driving.
83.875	They're essentially, to a point, attempts at planning
86.987	what other people should do, planning their life for them.
90.189	Now, planning a complex social system
92.641	is a very hard thing to do, and let me tell you a story.
95.716	Back in 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell,
98.443	an urban planner in London got a phone call
101.065	from a colleague in Moscow saying, basically,
103.615	"""Hi, this is Vladimir. I'd like to know,"
106.133	"who's in charge of London's bread supply?"""
109.155	And the urban planner in London goes,
110.808	"""What do you mean, who's in charge of London's â€”"
112.778	"I mean, no one is in charge."""
114.049	"""Oh, but surely someone must be in charge."
115.931	"I mean, it's a very complicated system. Someone must control all of this."""
119.587	"""No. No. No one is in charge."
122.693	I mean, it basically -- I haven't really thought of it.
125.294	"It basically organizes itself."""
127.883	It organizes itself.
130.46	That's an example of a complex social system
133.303	which has the ability of self-organizing,
136.031	and this is a very deep insight.
138.619	When you try to solve really complex social problems,
141.932	the right thing to do is most of the time
143.648	to create the incentives.
145.239	You don't plan the details,
147.183	and people will figure out what to do,
149.803	how to adapt to this new framework.
151.663	And let's now look at how we can use this insight
155.154	to combat road congestion.
156.79	This is a map of Stockholm, my hometown.
159.022	Now, Stockholm is a medium-sized city, roughly two million people,
162.663	but Stockholm also has lots of water and lots of water
165.452	means lots of bridges -- narrow bridges, old bridges --
168.729	which means lots of road congestion.
171.764	And these red dots show the most congested parts,
175.404	which are the bridges that lead into the inner city.
177.981	And then someone came up with the idea that,
180.507	apart from good public transport,
182.344	apart from spending money on roads,
184.945	let's try to charge drivers one or two euros at these bottlenecks.
189.16	Now, one or two euros, that isn't really a lot of money,
192.084	I mean compared to parking charges and running costs, etc.,
194.741	so you would probably expect that car drivers
197.459	wouldn't really react to this fairly small charge.
199.897	You would be wrong.
201.197	One or two euros was enough to make 20 percent of cars
205.225	disappear from rush hours.
207.609	Now, 20 percent, well, that's a fairly huge figure, you might think,
211.16	but you've still got 80 percent left of the problem, right?
213.367	Because you still have 80 percent of the traffic.
215.236	Now, that's also wrong, because traffic happens to be
218.503	a nonlinear phenomenon, meaning that
221.195	once you reach above a certain capacity threshold
224.336	then congestion starts to increase really, really rapidly.
227.504	But fortunately, it also works the other way around.
229.964	If you can reduce traffic even somewhat, then congestion
233.295	will go down much faster than you might think.
236.924	Now, congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm
239.815	on January 3, 2006, and the first picture here is a picture
244.419	of Stockholm, one of the typical streets, January 2.
248.402	The first day with the congestion charges looked like this.
252.215	This is what happens when you take away
257.2	You really reduce congestion quite substantially.
259.91	But, well, as I said, I mean, car drivers adapt, right?
263.568	So after a while they would all come back because they
266.07	have sort of gotten used to charges.
268.018	Wrong again. It's now six and a half years ago
271.694	since the congestion charges were introduced in Stockholm,
273.677	and we basically have the same low traffic levels still.
277.666	But you see, there's an interesting gap here in the time series
279.937	in 2007.
281.4	Well, the thing is that, the congestion charges,
283.789	they were introduced first as a trial, so they were introduced
286.885	in January and then abolished again at the end of July,
290.854	followed by a referendum, and then they were reintroduced
293.448	again in 2007, which of course was a wonderful scientific opportunity.
297.648	I mean, this was a really fun experiment to start with,
301.785	and we actually got to do it twice.
303.566	And personally, I would like to do this every once a year or so,
305.675	but they won't let me do that.
307.163	But it was fun anyway.
309.348	So, we followed up. What happened?
312.733	This is the last day with the congestion charges, July 31,
316.599	and you see the same street but now it's summer,
318.377	and summer in Stockholm is a very nice
320.121	and light time of the year,
322.371	and the first day without the congestion charges
325.214	looked like this.
326.581	All the cars were back again, and you even have to admire
329.244	the car drivers. They adapt so extremely quickly.
332.154	The first day they all came back.
334.401	And this effect hanged on. So 2007 figures looked like this.
339.751	Now these traffic figures are really exciting
342.082	and a little bit surprising and very useful to know,
344.733	but I would say that the most surprising slide here
347.492	I'm going to show you today is not this one. It's this one.
351.522	This shows public support for congestion pricing of Stockholm,
354.853	and you see that when congestion pricing were introduced
357.522	in the beginning of Spring 2006, people were fiercely against it.
361.839	Seventy percent of the population didn't want this.
364.867	But what happened when the congestion charges
366.515	were there is not what you would expect, that people hated it more and more.
369.976	No, on the contrary, they changed, up to a point
373.129	where we now have 70 percent support for keeping the charges,
376.83	meaning that -- I mean, let me repeat that:
381.478	want to keep a price for something that used to be free.
385.471	Okay. So why can that be? Why is that?
389.097	Well, think about it this way. Who changed?
392.097	I mean, the 20 percent of the car drivers that disappeared,
394.723	surely they must be discontent in a way.
396.668	And where did they go? If we can understand this,
399.002	then maybe we can figure out how people can be so happy with this.
403.132	Well, so we did this huge interview survey
405.534	with lots of travel services, and tried to figure out
407.369	who changed, and where did they go?
409.124	And it turned out that they don't know themselves. (Laughter)
413.538	For some reason, the car drivers are --
418.386	they are confident they actually drive the same way that they used to do.
421.882	And why is that? It's because that travel patterns
424.138	are much less stable than you might think.
426.537	Each day, people make new decisions, and people change
429.368	and the world changes around them, and each day
431.793	all of these decisions are sort of nudged ever so slightly
435.046	away from rush hour car driving
437.013	in a way that people don't even notice.
439.597	They're not even aware of this themselves.
441.642	And the other question, who changed their mind?
444.443	Who changed their opinion, and why?
446.409	So we did another interview survey, tried to figure out
448.935	why people changed their mind, and what type of group changed their minds?
453.311	And after analyzing the answers, it turned out that
456.204	more than half of them believe that they haven't changed their minds.
460.089	They're actually confident that they have
462.376	liked congestion pricing all along.
465.065	Which means that we are now in a position
466.784	where we have reduced traffic across this toll cordon
469.777	with 20 percent, and reduced congestion by enormous numbers,
472.988	and people aren't even aware that they have changed,
476.535	and they honestly believe that they have liked this all along.
480.446	This is the power of nudges when trying to solve
483.92	complex social problems, and when you do that,
486.552	you shouldn't try to tell people how to adapt.
490.182	You should just nudge them in the right direction.
492.369	And if you do it right,
494.091	people will actually embrace the change,
496.143	and if you do it right, people will actually even like it.
499.205	Thank you. (Applause)
