12.915	It's very nice to be here tonight.
14.88	So I've been working on the history of income
18.596	and wealth distribution for the past 15 years,
21.915	and one of the interesting lessons
25.016	coming from this historical evidence
27.517	is indeed that, in the long run,
29.53	there is a tendency for 
29.53	the rate of return of capital
33.25	to exceed the economy's growth rate,
35.92	and this tends to lead to 
35.92	high concentration of wealth.
38.665	Not infinite concentration of wealth,
40.498	but the higher the gap between r and g,
43.289	the higher the level of inequality of wealth
46.224	towards which society tends to converge.
49.431	So this is a key force that
49.431	I'm going to talk about today,
52.985	but let me say right away
54.954	that this is not the only important force
57.284	in the dynamics of income 
57.284	and wealth distribution,
59.757	and there are many other forces that play
61.782	an important role in the long-run dynamics
64.763	of income and wealth distribution.
66.338	Also there is a lot of data
68.307	that still needs to be collected.
69.863	We know a little bit more today
72.795	than we used to know, 
72.795	but we still know too little,
75.316	and certainly there are 
75.316	many different processes —
77.992	economic, social, political —
80.29	that need to be studied more.
81.717	And so I'm going to focus today on this simple force,
84.697	but that doesn't mean that other important forces
86.958	do not exist.
88.162	So most of the data I'm going to present
90.434	comes from this database
92.639	that's available online:
93.899	the World Top Incomes Database.
95.384	So this is the largest existing
97.487	historical database on inequality,
99.94	and this comes from the effort
101.29	of over 30 scholars from several dozen countries.
105.182	So let me show you a couple of facts
107.96	coming from this database,
109.105	and then we'll return to r bigger than g.
111.179	So fact number one is that there has been
113.689	a big reversal in the ordering of income inequality
116.74	between the United States and Europe
118.645	over the past century.
120.4	So back in 1900, 1910, income inequality was actually
123.905	much higher in Europe than in the United States,
126.17	whereas today, it is a lot higher in the United States.
129.28	So let me be very clear:
130.946	The main explanation for this is not r bigger than g.
133.77	It has more to do with changing supply and demand
137.267	for skill, the race between education and technology,
140.72	globalization, probably more unequal access
144.3	to skills in the U.S.,
145.906	where you have very good, very top universities
148.493	but where the bottom part of the educational system
150.735	is not as good,
151.5	so very unequal access to skills,
153.861	and also an unprecedented rise
155.78	of top managerial compensation of the United States,
158.8	which is difficult to account for
158.8	just on the basis of education.
161.65	So there is more going on here,
163.604	but I'm not going to talk too much about this today,
166.213	because I want to focus on wealth inequality.
168.879	So let me just show you a very simple indicator
171.86	about the income inequality part.
174.21	So this is the share of total income
176.664	going to the top 10 percent.
178.452	So you can see that one century ago,
180.624	it was between 45 and 50 percent in Europe
184.201	and a little bit above 40 percent in the U.S.,
186.939	so there was more inequality in Europe.
189.21	Then there was a sharp decline
191.234	during the first half of the 20th century,
193.765	and in the recent decade, you can see that
196.128	the U.S. has become more unequal than Europe,
199.63	and this is the first fact I just talked about.
202.3	Now, the second fact is more about wealth inequality,
206.211	and here the central fact is that wealth inequality
209.301	is always a lot higher than income inequality,
211.907	and also that wealth inequality,
214.292	although it has also increased in recent decades,
216.945	is still less extreme today
218.801	than what it was a century ago,
220.68	although the total quantity of wealth
223.199	relative to income has now recovered
225.224	from the very large shocks
226.855	caused by World War I, the Great Depression,
228.88	World War II.
230.099	So let me show you two graphs
232.143	illustrating fact number two and fact number three.
235	So first, if you look at the level of wealth inequality,
239.39	this is the share of total wealth
242.548	going to the top 10 percent of wealth holders,
245.07	so you can see the same kind of reversal
247.779	between the U.S. and Europe that we had before
250.344	for income inequality.
252.02	So wealth concentration was higher
255.57	in Europe than in the U.S. a century ago,
257.813	and now it is the opposite.
259.647	But you can also show two things:
261.638	First, the general level of wealth inequality
265.339	is always higher than income inequality.
267.994	So remember, for income inequality,
270.334	the share going to the top 10 percent
272.662	was between 30 and 50 percent of total income,
276.96	whereas for wealth, the share is always
279.772	between 60 and 90 percent.
281.831	Okay, so that's fact number one,
283.347	and that's very important for what follows.
285.273	Wealth concentration is always
286.994	a lot higher than income concentration.
288.873	Fact number two is that the rise
292.259	in wealth inequality in recent decades
295.206	is still not enough to get us back to 1910.
299.492	So the big difference today,
301.269	wealth inequality is still very large,
303.182	with 60, 70 percent of total wealth for the top 10,
306.444	but the good news is that it's actually
308.289	better than one century ago,
310.07	where you had 90 percent in
310.07	Europe going to the top 10.
313.441	So today what you have
315.432	is what I call the middle 40 percent,
317.434	the people who are not in the top 10
319.347	and who are not in the bottom 50,
321.12	and what you can view as the wealth middle class
323.386	that owns 20 to 30 percent
326.529	of total wealth, national wealth,
328.391	whereas they used to be poor, a century ago,
331.722	when there was basically no wealth middle class.
334.34	So this is an important change,
335.917	and it's interesting to see that wealth inequality
340.532	has not fully recovered to pre-World War I levels,
343.838	although the total quantity of wealth has recovered.
347.347	Okay? So this is the total value
349.294	of wealth relative to income,
351.51	and you can see that in particular in Europe,
353.623	we are almost back to the pre-World War I level.
357.483	So there are really two
359.328	different parts of the story here.
361.859	One has to do with
362.978	the total quantity of wealth that we accumulate,
365.42	and there is nothing bad per se, of course,
367.098	in accumulating a lot of wealth,
368.845	and in particular if it is more diffuse
371.713	and less concentrated.
373.107	So what we really want to focus on
375.852	is the long-run evolution of wealth inequality,
378.233	and what's going to happen in the future.
380.533	How can we account for the fact that
382.558	until World War I, wealth inequality was so high
386.22	and, if anything, was rising to even higher levels,
389.41	and how can we think about the future?
392.737	So let me come to some of the explanations
396.623	and speculations about the future.
398.759	Let me first say that
400.354	probably the best model to explain
402.341	why wealth is so much
404.438	more concentrated than income
406.624	is a dynamic, dynastic model
409.736	where individuals have a long horizon
412.2	and accumulate wealth for all sorts of reasons.
414.956	If people were accumulating wealth
417.566	only for life cycle reasons,
419.569	you know, to be able to consume
421.582	when they are old,
423.169	then the level of wealth inequality
425.542	should be more or less in line
427.859	with the level of income inequality.
429.828	But it will be very difficult to explain
431.756	why you have so much more wealth inequality
433.95	than income inequality
435.434	with a pure life cycle model,
436.71	so you need a story
438.741	where people also care
440.429	about wealth accumulation for other reasons.
442.96	So typically, they want to transmit
444.884	wealth to the next generation, to their children,
448.21	or sometimes they want to accumulate wealth
449.978	because of the prestige, the
449.978	power that goes with wealth.
452.746	So there must be other reasons
454.13	for accumulating wealth than just life cycle
456.12	to explain what we see in the data.
458.888	Now, in a large class of dynamic models
462.234	of wealth accumulation
464.21	with such dynastic motive for accumulating wealth,
467.768	you will have all sorts of random,
470.614	multiplicative shocks.
471.537	So for instance, some families
473.786	have a very large number of children,
475.473	so the wealth will be divided.
477.239	Some families have fewer children.
479.129	You also have shocks to rates of return.
481.357	Some families make huge capital gains.
483.454	Some made bad investments.
485.249	So you will always have some mobility
487.49	in the wealth process.
488.928	Some people will move up,
488.928	some people will move down.
491.303	The important point is that,
492.955	in any such model,
493.965	for a given variance of such shocks,
496.521	the equilibrium level of wealth inequality
498.557	will be a steeply rising function of r minus g.
503.394	And intuitively, the reason why the difference
506.263	between the rate of return to wealth
508.107	and the growth rate is important
509.862	is that initial wealth inequalities
512.174	will be amplified at a faster pace
514.565	with a bigger r minus g.
516.634	So take a simple example,
518.108	with r equals five percent and g equals one percent,
521.874	wealth holders only need to reinvest
523.982	one fifth of their capital income to ensure
526.621	that their wealth rises as fast
529.354	as the size of the economy.
531.267	So this makes it easier
532.65	to build and perpetuate large fortunes
534.416	because you can consume four fifths,
536.371	assuming zero tax,
538.11	and you can just reinvest one fifth.
539.771	So of course some families
539.771	will consume more than that,
542.359	some will consume less, so there will be
544.102	some mobility in the distribution,
545.857	but on average, they only need to reinvest one fifth,
548.703	so this allows high wealth inequalities to be sustained.
552.472	Now, you should not be surprised
554.969	by the statement that r can be bigger than g forever,
558.505	because, in fact, this is what happened
560.121	during most of the history of mankind.
562.192	And this was in a way very obvious to everybody
565.543	for a simple reason, which is that growth
567.321	was close to zero percent
569.509	during most of the history of mankind.
571.13	Growth was maybe 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 percent,
574.662	but very slow growth of population
576.658	and output per capita,
578.655	whereas the rate of return on capital
580.539	of course was not zero percent.
582.395	It was, for land assets, which was
584.431	the traditional form
586.24	of assets in preindustrial societies,
588.641	it was typically five percent.
590.404	Any reader of Jane Austen would know that.
594.19	If you want an annual income of 1,000 pounds,
597.098	you should have a capital value
598.74	of 20,000 pounds so that
600.596	five percent of 20,000 is 1,000.
603.146	And in a way, this was
605.163	the very foundation of society,
606.941	because r bigger than g
609.976	was what allowed holders of wealth and assets
614.1	to live off their capital income
616.79	and to do something else in life
619.49	than just to care about their own survival.
622.685	Now, one important conclusion
624.845	of my historical research is that
626.836	modern industrial growth did not change
629.547	this basic fact as much as one might have expected.
632.371	Of course, the growth rate
634.05	following the Industrial Revolution
635.858	rose, typically from zero to one to two percent,
640.18	but at the same time, the rate of return
642.11	to capital also rose
643.755	so that the gap between the two
646.18	did not really change.
647.636	So during the 20th century,
649.886	you had a very unique combination of events.
652.53	First, a very low rate of return
654.547	due to the 1914 and 1945 war shocks,
657.563	destruction of wealth, inflation,
659.868	bankruptcy during the Great Depression,
661.848	and all of this reduced
663.513	the private rate of return to wealth
665.263	to unusually low levels
667.158	between 1914 and 1945.
669.497	And then, in the postwar period,
671.333	you had unusually high growth rate,
674.57	partly due to the reconstruction.
676.944	You know, in Germany, in France, in Japan,
678.869	you had five percent growth rate
680.42	between 1950 and 1980
683.57	largely due to reconstruction,
685.213	and also due to very large demographic growth,
687.564	the Baby Boom Cohort effect.
689.705	Now, apparently that's not going to last for very long,
692.143	or at least the population growth
693.818	is supposed to decline in the future,
696.586	and the best projections we have is that
700.242	the long-run growth is going to be closer
702.07	to one to two percent
703.493	rather than four to five percent.
705.439	So if you look at this,
708.116	these are the best estimates we have
710.257	of world GDP growth
711.913	and rate of return on capital,
714.272	average rates of return on capital,
716.36	so you can see that during most
717.428	of the history of mankind,
718.945	the growth rate was very small,
720.558	much lower than the rate of return,
722.392	and then during the 20th century,
724.754	it is really the population growth,
726.925	very high in the postwar period,
729.197	and the reconstruction process
730.797	that brought growth
732.37	to a smaller gap with the rate of return.
735.441	Here I use the United Nations population projections,
738.964	so of course they are uncertain.
741.44	It could be that we all start
742.831	having a lot of children in the future,
744.937	and the growth rates are going to be higher,
747.702	but from now on,
748.951	these are the best projections we have,
751.753	and this will make global growth
753.687	decline and the gap between
756.443	the rate of return go up.
758.446	Now, the other unusual event
761.308	during the 20th century
762.979	was, as I said,
764.308	destruction, taxation of capital,
766.624	so this is the pre-tax rate of return.
769.359	This is the after-tax rate of return,
772.338	and after destruction,
773.904	and this is what brought
775.681	the average rate of return
777.369	after tax, after destruction,
779.158	below the growth rate during a long time period.
781.578	But without the destruction,
783.252	without the taxation, this 
783.252	would not have happened.
785.727	So let me say that the balance between
788.97	returns on capital and growth
791.326	depends on many different factors
793.188	that are very difficult to predict:
795.273	technology and the development
797.388	of capital-intensive techniques.
799.972	So right now, the most capital-intensive sectors
802.991	in the economy are the real estate sector, housing,
806.367	the energy sector, but it could be in the future
809.229	that we have a lot more robots in a number of sectors
812.941	and that this would be a bigger share
814.83	of the total capital stock that it is today.
816.74	Well, we are very far from this,
818.734	and from now, what's going on
820.5	in the real estate sector, the energy sector,
822.289	is much more important for the total capital stock
824.415	and capital share.
825.549	The other important issue
827.582	is that there are scale effects
827.582	in portfolio management,
829.732	together with financial complexity,
832.151	financial deregulation,
833.601	that make it easier to get higher rates of return
836.31	for a large portfolio,
837.937	and this seems to be particularly strong
840.6	for billionaires, large capital endowments.
842.582	Just to give you one example,
844.872	this comes from the Forbes billionaire rankings
848.205	over the 1987-2013 period,
851.535	and you can see the very top wealth holders
854.323	have been going up at six, seven percent per year
857.44	in real terms above inflation,
859.831	whereas average income in the world,
862.203	average wealth in the world,
863.566	have increased at only two percent per year.
866.949	And you find the same
868.678	for large university endowments —
869.954	the bigger the initial endowments,
872.222	the bigger the rate of return.
874.29	Now, what could be done?
875.968	The first thing is that I think we need
878.364	more financial transparency.
880.479	We know too little about global wealth dynamics,
884.32	so we need international transmission
886.22	of bank information.
887.482	We need a global registry of financial assets,
890.168	more coordination on wealth taxation,
892.659	and even wealth tax with a small tax rate
895.771	will be a way to produce information
897.987	so that then we can adapt our policies
900.669	to whatever we observe.
902.505	And to some extent, the fight
904.343	against tax havens
905.824	and automatic transmission of information
907.639	is pushing us in this direction.
909.49	Now, there are other ways to redistribute wealth,
911.814	which it can be tempting to use.
914.771	Inflation:
916.127	it's much easier to print money
917.826	than to write a tax code, so that's very tempting,
919.981	but sometimes you don't know
919.981	what you do with the money.
922.101	This is a problem.
923.748	Expropriation is very tempting.
925.611	Just when you feel some people get too wealthy,
927.872	you just expropriate them.
929.166	But this is not a very efficient way
930.878	to organize a regulation of wealth dynamics.
933.711	So war is an even less efficient way,
936.19	so I tend to prefer progressive taxation,
938.526	but of course, history — (Laughter) —
941.1	history will invent its own best ways,
942.835	and it will probably involve
944.533	a combination of all of these.
946.267	Thank you.
948.133	(Applause)
950.27	Bruno Giussani: Thomas Piketty. Thank you.
955.829	Thomas, I want to ask you two or three questions,
957.708	because it's impressive how you're
957.708	in command of your data, of course,
961.567	but basically what you suggest is
965.361	growing wealth concentration is kind of
966.934	a natural tendency of capitalism,
968.858	and if we leave it to its own devices,
972.396	it may threaten the system itself,
974.636	so you're suggesting that we need to act
976.362	to implement policies that redistribute wealth,
979.4	including the ones we just saw:
981.121	progressive taxation, etc.
982.592	In the current political context,
984.731	how realistic are those?
986.722	How likely do you think that it is
988.533	that they will be implemented?
990.277	Thomas Piketty: Well, you know, I think
991.488	if you look back through time,
993.269	the history of income, wealth and taxation
995.92	is full of surprise.
997.522	So I am not terribly impressed
1000.127	by those who know in advance
1001.695	what will or will not happen.
1003.326	I think one century ago,
1005.03	many people would have said
1006.599	that progressive income taxation would never happen
1008.737	and then it happened.
1010.257	And even five years ago,
1012.246	many people would have said that bank secrecy
1014.598	will be with us forever in Switzerland,
1016.623	that Switzerland was too powerful
1018.411	for the rest of the world,
1019.9	and then suddenly it took a few U.S. sanctions
1022.861	against Swiss banks for a big change to happen,
1025.483	and now we are moving toward
1027.186	more financial transparency.
1028.862	So I think it's not that difficult
1033.143	to better coordinate politically.
1035.612	We are going to have a treaty
1037.67	with half of the world GDP around the table
1040.719	with the U.S. and the European Union,
1042.721	so if half of the world GDP is not enough
1044.847	to make progress on financial transparency
1047.513	and minimal tax for multinational corporate profits,
1051.597	what does it take?
1053.261	So I think these are not technical difficulties.
1056.884	I think we can make progress
1058.808	if we have a more pragmatic
1058.808	approach to these questions
1061.395	and we have the proper sanctions
1063.296	on those who benefit from financial opacity.
1066.287	BG: One of the arguments
1067.94	against your point of view
1069.373	is that economic inequality
1070.815	is not only a feature of capitalism
1070.815	but is actually one of its engines.
1074.452	So we take measures to lower inequality,
1077.253	and at the same time we lower growth, potentially.
1079.66	What do you answer to that?
1081.22	TP: Yeah, I think inequality
1082.949	is not a problem per se.
1084.838	I think inequality up to a point
1086.878	can actually be useful for innovation and growth.
1089.53	The problem is, it's a question of degree.
1091.723	When inequality gets too extreme,
1094.267	then it becomes useless for growth
1097.156	and it can even become bad
1098.618	because it tends to lead to high perpetuation
1101.675	of inequality over time
1103.311	and low mobility.
1105.177	And for instance, the kind of wealth concentrations
1108.463	that we had in the 19th century
1111.34	and pretty much until World War I
1113.265	in every European country
1115.03	was, I think, not useful for growth.
1117.124	This was destroyed by a combination
1119.226	of tragic events and policy changes,
1121.567	and this did not prevent growth from happening.
1123.839	And also, extreme inequality can be bad
1127.282	for our democratic institutions
1129.48	if it creates very unequal access to political voice,
1131.863	and the influence of private money
1133.728	in U.S. politics, I think,
1135.73	is a matter of concern right now.
1138.27	So we don't want to return to that kind of extreme,
1141.346	pre-World War I inequality.
1143.436	Having a decent share of the national wealth
1147.11	for the middle class is not bad for growth.
1150.5	It is actually useful
1151.781	both for equity and efficiency reasons.
1154.865	BG: I said at the beginning
1156.53	that your book has been criticized.
1158.639	Some of your data has been criticized.
1159.88	Some of your choice of data sets has been criticized.
1162.346	You have been accused of cherry-picking data
1164.222	to make your case. What do you answer to that?
1166.959	TP: Well, I answer that I am very happy
1168.886	that this book is stimulating debate.
1171.353	This is part of what it is intended for.
1173.834	Look, the reason why I put all the data online
1177.128	with all of the detailed computation
1178.974	is so that we can have 
1178.974	an open and transparent
1181.308	debate about this.
1182.977	So I have responded point by point
1184.743	to every concern.
1186.535	Let me say that if I was to rewrite the book today,
1189.648	I would actually conclude
1191.189	that the rise in wealth inequality,
1193.383	particularly in the United States,
1195.31	has been actually higher
1195.31	than what I report in my book.
1197.683	There is a recent study by Saez and Zucman
1200.928	showing, with new data
1202.52	which I didn't have at the time of the book,
1204.297	that wealth concentration in the U.S. has risen
1206.824	even more than what I report.
1208.76	And there will be other data in the future.
1210.791	Some of it will go in different directions.
1212.942	Look, we put online almost every week
1217.041	new, updated series on the
1217.041	World Top Income Database
1219.975	and we will keep doing so in the future,
1221.875	in particular in emerging countries,
1224.181	and I welcome all of those who want to contribute
1227.11	to this data collection process.
1229.456	In fact, I certainly agree
1232.264	that there is not enough
1233.878	transparency about wealth dynamics,
1235.756	and a good way to have better data
1237.671	would be to have a wealth tax
1239.536	with a small tax rate to begin with
1241.107	so that we can all agree
1243.446	about this important evolution
1245.01	and adapt our policies to whatever we observe.
1248.337	So taxation is a source of knowledge,
1250.399	and that's what we need the most right now.
1253.335	BG: Thomas Piketty, merci beaucoup.
1255.15	Thank you.
1255.15	TP: Thank you. (Applause)
