13.063	The child's symptoms begin
15.295	with mild fever, headache, muscle pains,
18.956	followed by vomiting and diarrhea,
21.067	then bleeding from the mouth,
21.067	nose and gums.
25.603	Death follows in the form of organ failure
25.603	from low blood pressure.
31.887	Sounds familiar?
33.592	If you're thinking this is Ebola,
36.215	actually, in this case, it's not.
38.576	It's an extreme form of dengue fever,
38.576	a mosquito-born disease
43.955	which also does not have
43.955	an effective therapy or a vaccine,
48.04	and kills 22,000 people each year.
52.018	That is actually twice
52.018	the number of people
54.918	that have been killed by Ebola
56.971	in the nearly four decades
56.971	that we've known about it.
60.74	As for measles, so much
60.74	in the news recently,
64.463	the death toll is actually tenfold higher.
69.578	Yet for the last year,
71.373	it has been Ebola that has stolen
71.373	all of the headlines and the fear.
77.059	Clearly, there is something
77.059	deeply rooted about it,
79.88	something which scares us
79.88	and fascinates us
82.783	more than other diseases.
84.896	But what is it, exactly?
87.357	Well, it's hard to acquire Ebola,
89.61	but if you do, the risk
89.61	of a horrible death is high.
93.697	Why?
94.873	Because right now, we don't have any
94.873	effective therapy or vaccine available.
100.133	And so, that's the clue.
103.022	We may have it someday.
105.453	So we rightfully fear Ebola,
108.804	because it doesn't kill
108.804	as many people as other diseases.
113.246	In fact, it's much less transmissible
113.246	than viruses such as flu or measles.
119.27	We fear Ebola because of the fact
119.27	that it kills us and we can't treat it.
125.112	We fear the certain inevitability
125.112	that comes with Ebola.
128.524	Ebola has this inevitability
128.524	that seems to defy modern medical science.
134.507	But wait a second, why is that?
136.705	We've known about Ebola since 1976.
140.036	We've known what it's capable of.
142.132	We've had ample opportunity to study it
144.786	in the 24 outbreaks that have occurred.
147.491	And in fact, we've actually had
147.491	vaccine candidates available now
151.991	for more than a decade.
153.856	Why is that those vaccines
153.856	are just going into clinical trials now?
158.93	This goes to the fundamental
158.93	problem we have
161.788	with vaccine development
161.788	for infectious diseases.
165.197	It goes something like this:
167.983	The people most at risk for these diseases
170.81	are also the ones least able
170.81	to pay for vaccines.
175.858	This leaves little in the way
175.858	of market incentives
179.281	for manufacturers to develop vaccines,
182.269	unless there are large numbers of people
182.269	who are at risk in wealthy countries.
187.522	It's simply too commercially risky.
191.244	As for Ebola, there is absolutely
191.244	no market at all,
195.432	so the only reason we have two vaccines
195.432	in late-stage clinical trials now,
201.084	is actually because
201.084	of a somewhat misguided fear.
204.52	Ebola was relatively ignored
207.768	until September 11
207.768	and the anthrax attacks,
212.333	when all of a sudden,
212.333	people perceived Ebola
214.891	as, potentially, a bioterrorism weapon.
217.485	Why is it that the Ebola vaccine
217.485	wasn't fully developed at this point?
222.167	Well, partially, because
222.167	it was really difficult --
224.787	or thought to be difficult --
224.787	to weaponize the virus,
227.46	but mainly because
227.46	of the financial risk in developing it.
233.028	And this is really the point.
235.718	The sad reality is, we develop vaccines
238.262	not based upon the risk
238.262	the pathogen poses to people,
242.158	but on how economically risky it is
242.158	to develop these vaccines.
246.887	Vaccine development
246.887	is expensive and complicated.
249.82	It can cost hundreds
249.82	of millions of dollars
251.915	to take even a well-known antigen
251.915	and turn it into a viable vaccine.
257.001	Fortunately for diseases like Ebola,
259.479	there are things we can do
259.479	to remove some of these barriers.
263.385	The first is to recognize
263.385	when there's a complete market failure.
267.314	In that case, if we want vaccines,
270.372	we have to provide incentives
270.372	or some type of subsidy.
276.197	We also need to do a better job
276.197	at being able to figure out
280.561	which are the diseases
280.561	that most threaten us.
283.26	By creating capabilities within countries,
283.26	we then create the ability
288.199	for those countries to create
288.199	epidemiological and laboratory networks
292.84	which are capable of collecting
292.84	and categorizing these pathogens.
298.117	The data from that then can be used
300.403	to understand the geographic
300.403	and genetic diversity,
303.706	which then can be used
303.706	to help us understand
306.366	how these are being changed
306.366	immunologically,
310.033	and what type of reactions they promote.
313.198	So these are the things that can be done,
315.549	but to do this, if we want to deal
315.549	with a complete market failure,
319.257	we have to change the way
319.257	we view and prevent infectious diseases.
324.705	We have to stop waiting
324.705	until we see evidence
328.916	of a disease becoming a global threat
328.916	before we consider it as one.
334.617	So, for Ebola,
336.88	the paranoid fear
336.88	of an infectious disease,
340.795	followed by a few cases
340.795	transported to wealthy countries,
345.541	led the global community to come together,
348.165	and with the work
348.165	of dedicated vaccine companies,
351.694	we now have these:
354.465	Two Ebola vaccines in efficacy trials
354.465	in the Ebola countries --
360.496	(Applause)
366.025	and a pipeline of vaccines
366.025	that are following behind.
370.763	Every year, we spend billions of dollars,
373.879	keeping a fleet of nuclear submarines
373.879	permanently patrolling the oceans
378.976	to protect us from a threat
378.976	that almost certainly will never happen.
383.527	And yet, we spend virtually nothing
386.487	to prevent something as tangible
386.487	and evolutionarily certain
391.538	as epidemic infectious diseases.
395.009	And make no mistake about it --
395.009	"it's not a question of ""if,"" but ""when."""
398.928	These bugs are going to continue to evolve
401.864	and they're going to threaten the world.
404.28	And vaccines are our best defense.
407.108	So if we want to be able to prevent
407.108	epidemics like Ebola,
411.441	we need to take on the risk
411.441	of investing in vaccine development
415.911	and in stockpile creation.
418.76	And we need to view this, then,
418.76	as the ultimate deterrent --
422.409	something we make sure is available,
425.553	but at the same time,
425.553	praying we never have to use it.
429.621	Thank you.
430.796	(Applause)
