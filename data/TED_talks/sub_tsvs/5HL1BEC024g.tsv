12.656	Well, I have a big announcement to make today,
14.959	and I'm really excited about this.
17.132	And this may be a little bit of a surprise
19.46	to many of you who know my research
22.714	and what I've done well.
24.869	I've really tried to solve some big problems:
28.273	counterterrorism, nuclear terrorism,
30.74	and health care and diagnosing and treating cancer,
34.388	but I started thinking about all these problems,
36.852	and I realized that the really biggest problem we face,
41.412	what all these other problems come down to,
43.66	is energy, is electricity, the flow of electrons.
47.302	And I decided that I was going to set out
50.421	to try to solve this problem.
53.803	And this probably is not what you're expecting.
57.775	You're probably expecting me to come up here
59.427	and talk about fusion,
61.006	because that's what I've done most of my life.
62.986	But this is actually a talk about, okay --
66.252	(Laughter) —
68.876	but this is actually a talk about fission.
71.843	It's about perfecting something old,
73.369	and bringing something old into the 21st century.
76.019	Let's talk a little bit about how nuclear fission works.
80.644	In a nuclear power plant, you have
82.388	a big pot of water that's under high pressure,
85.036	and you have some fuel rods,
86.554	and these fuel rods are encased in zirconium,
88.923	and they're little pellets of uranium dioxide fuel,
91.793	and a fission reaction is controlled and maintained at a proper level,
95.949	and that reaction heats up water,
99.1	the water turns to steam, steam turns the turbine,
101.925	and you produce electricity from it.
103.855	This is the same way we've been producing electricity,
106.635	the steam turbine idea, for 100 years,
110.1	and nuclear was a really big advancement
113.121	in a way to heat the water,
114.701	but you still boil water and that turns to steam and turns the turbine.
119.156	And I thought, you know, is this the best way to do it?
122.972	Is fission kind of played out,
125.772	or is there something left to innovate here?
128.627	And I realized that I had hit upon something
131.212	that I think has this huge potential to change the world.
135.516	And this is what it is.
139.007	This is a small modular reactor.
141.612	So it's not as big as the reactor you see in the diagram here.
146.316	This is between 50 and 100 megawatts.
148.719	But that's a ton of power.
150.34	That's between, say at an average use,
153.789	that's maybe 25,000 to 100,000 homes could run off that.
158.93	Now the really interesting thing about these reactors
161.508	is they're built in a factory.
163.633	So they're modular reactors that are built
165.596	essentially on an assembly line,
167.941	and they're trucked anywhere in the world,
170.1	you plop them down, and they produce electricity.
172.411	This region right here is the reactor.
175.853	And this is buried below ground, which is really important.
178.164	For someone who's done a lot of counterterrorism work,
180.877	I can't extol to you
183.573	how great having something buried below the ground is
186.358	for proliferation and security concerns.
190.397	And inside this reactor is a molten salt,
193.91	so anybody who's a fan of thorium,
196.688	they're going to be really excited about this,
198.014	because these reactors happen to be really good
203.096	at breeding and burning the thorium fuel cycle,
205.68	uranium-233.
207.731	But I'm not really concerned about the fuel.
210.301	You can run these off -- they're really hungry,
213.525	they really like down-blended weapons pits,
216.957	so that's highly enriched uranium and weapons-grade plutonium
219.821	that's been down-blended.
220.854	It's made into a grade where it's not usable for a nuclear weapon,
224.246	but they love this stuff.
227.397	And we have a lot of it sitting around,
229.18	because this is a big problem.
230.822	You know, in the Cold War, we built up this huge arsenal
232.939	of nuclear weapons, and that was great,
235.279	and we don't need them anymore,
237.734	and what are we doing with all the waste, essentially?
241.078	What are we doing with all the pits of those nuclear weapons?
243.493	Well, we're securing them, and it would be great
245.394	if we could burn them, eat them up,
247.138	and this reactor loves this stuff.
249.139	So it's a molten salt reactor. It has a core,
252.161	and it has a heat exchanger from the hot salt,
255.935	the radioactive salt, to a cold salt which isn't radioactive.
260.005	It's still thermally hot but it's not radioactive.
262.652	And then that's a heat exchanger
264.432	to what makes this design really, really interesting,
267.725	and that's a heat exchanger to a gas.
270.733	So going back to what I was saying before about all power
273.277	being produced -- well, other than photovoltaic --
276.27	being produced by this boiling of steam and turning a turbine,
280.168	that's actually not that efficient, and in fact,
282.688	in a nuclear power plant like this,
285.064	it's only roughly 30 to 35 percent efficient.
289.872	That's how much thermal energy the reactor's putting out
292.409	to how much electricity it's producing.
294.062	And the reason the efficiencies are so low is these reactors
296.987	operate at pretty low temperature.
298.693	They operate anywhere from, you know,
300.448	maybe 200 to 300 degrees Celsius.
304.141	And these reactors run at 600 to 700 degrees Celsius,
308.14	which means the higher the temperature you go to,
310.845	thermodynamics tells you that you will have higher efficiencies.
313.741	And this reactor doesn't use water. It uses gas,
317.415	so supercritical CO2 or helium,
319.893	and that goes into a turbine,
321.334	and this is called the Brayton cycle.
323.195	This is the thermodynamic cycle that produces electricity,
325.669	and this makes this almost 50 percent efficient,
328.099	between 45 and 50 percent efficiency.
330.989	And I'm really excited about this,
332.66	because it's a very compact core.
335.173	Molten salt reactors are very compact by nature,
339.309	but what's also great is you get a lot more electricity out
342.614	for how much uranium you're fissioning,
345.359	not to mention the fact that these burn up.
347.438	Their burn-up is much higher.
349.03	So for a given amount of fuel you put in the reactor,
351.008	a lot more of it's being used.
353.364	And the problem with a traditional nuclear power plant like this
356.549	is, you've got these rods that are clad in zirconium,
360.821	and inside them are uranium dioxide fuel pellets.
363.55	Well, uranium dioxide's a ceramic,
365.724	and ceramic doesn't like releasing what's inside of it.
368.94	So you have what's called the xenon pit,
371.241	and so some of these fission products love neutrons.
373.345	They love the neutrons that are going on
374.592	and helping this reaction take place.
376.992	And they eat them up, which means that, combined with
379.968	the fact that the cladding doesn't last very long,
382.205	you can only run one of these reactors
383.919	for roughly, say, 18 months without refueling it.
388.447	So these reactors run for 30 years without refueling,
393.038	which is, in my opinion, very, very amazing,
395.758	because it means it's a sealed system.
397.711	No refueling means you can seal them up
400.582	and they're not going to be a proliferation risk,
403.495	and they're not going to have
405.766	either nuclear material or radiological material
408.27	proliferated from their cores.
410.582	But let's go back to safety, because everybody
413.646	after Fukushima had to reassess the safety of nuclear,
417.424	and one of the things when I set out to design a power reactor
419.974	was it had to be passively and intrinsically safe,
423.526	and I'm really excited about this reactor
426.005	for essentially two reasons.
428.334	One, it doesn't operate at high pressure.
431.278	So traditional reactors like a pressurized water reactor
434.519	or boiling water reactor, they're very, very hot water
436.951	at very high pressures, and this means, essentially,
440.358	in the event of an accident, if you had any kind of breach
443.222	of this stainless steel pressure vessel,
446.263	the coolant would leave the core.
448.535	These reactors operate at essentially atmospheric pressure,
451.574	so there's no inclination for the fission products
455.48	to leave the reactor in the event of an accident.
458.052	Also, they operate at high temperatures,
460.37	and the fuel is molten, so they can't melt down,
463.249	but in the event that the reactor ever went out of tolerances,
467.827	or you lost off-site power in the case
470.137	of something like Fukushima, there's a dump tank.
473.327	Because your fuel is liquid, and it's combined with your coolant,
477.798	you could actually just drain the core
480.169	into what's called a sub-critical setting,
482.35	basically a tank underneath the reactor
484.304	that has some neutrons absorbers.
486.264	And this is really important, because the reaction stops.
490.054	In this kind of reactor, you can't do that.
492.718	The fuel, like I said, is ceramic inside zirconium fuel rods,
496.199	and in the event of an accident in one of these type of reactors,
499.19	Fukushima and Three Mile Island --
501.327	looking back at Three Mile Island, we didn't really see this for a while —
504.222	but these zirconium claddings on these fuel rods,
507.708	what happens is, when they see high pressure water,
510.537	steam, in an oxidizing environment,
513.094	they'll actually produce hydrogen,
515.166	and that hydrogen has this explosive capability
518.094	to release fission products.
520.304	So the core of this reactor, since it's not under pressure
522.518	and it doesn't have this chemical reactivity,
524.782	means that there's no inclination for the fission products
528.256	to leave this reactor.
529.99	So even in the event of an accident,
532.255	yeah, the reactor may be toast, which is, you know,
535.973	sorry for the power company,
537.632	but we're not going to contaminate large quantities of land.
539.732	So I really think that in the, say,
545.872	and make fusion a reality,
548.092	this could be the source of energy
550.673	that provides carbon-free electricity.
553.347	Carbon-free electricity.
555.005	And it's an amazing technology because
558.35	not only does it combat climate change,
561.18	but it's an innovation.
562.684	It's a way to bring power to the developing world,
565.751	because it's produced in a factory and it's cheap.
568.23	You can put them anywhere in the world you want to.
570.366	And maybe something else.
573.622	As a kid, I was obsessed with space.
576.143	Well, I was obsessed with nuclear science too, to a point,
578.886	but before that I was obsessed with space,
581.286	and I was really excited about, you know,
583.197	being an astronaut and designing rockets,
585.071	which was something that was always exciting to me.
587.157	But I think I get to come back to this,
590.563	because imagine having a compact reactor in a rocket
593.864	that produces 50 to 100 megawatts.
596.694	That is the rocket designer's dream.
599.971	That's someone who is designing a habitat on another planet's dream.
603.702	Not only do you have 50 to 100 megawatts
605.706	to power whatever you want to provide propulsion to get you there,
610.119	but you have power once you get there.
611.518	You know, rocket designers who use solar panels
615.039	or fuel cells, I mean a few watts or kilowatts --
617.998	wow, that's a lot of power.
619.591	I mean, now we're talking about 100 megawatts.
622.036	That's a ton of power.
623.209	That could power a Martian community.
625.496	That could power a rocket there.
627.093	And so I hope that
629.8	maybe I'll have an opportunity to kind of explore
631.921	my rocketry passion at the same time that I explore my nuclear passion.
636.588	"And people say, ""Oh, well, you've launched this thing,"
639.578	"and it's radioactive, into space, and what about accidents?"""
642.142	But we launch plutonium batteries all the time.
645.175	Everybody was really excited about Curiosity,
647.294	and that had this big plutonium battery on board
649.895	that has plutonium-238,
652.014	which actually has a higher specific activity
654.414	than the low-enriched uranium fuel of these molten salt reactors,
658.158	which means that the effects would be negligible,
661.661	because you launch it cold,
663.113	and when it gets into space is where you actually activate this reactor.
666.824	So I'm really excited.
668.132	I think that I've designed this reactor here
670.669	that can be an innovative source of energy,
674.574	provide power for all kinds of neat scientific applications,
678.255	and I'm really prepared to do this.
680.783	I graduated high school in May, and --
683.55	(Laughter) (Applause) —
687.698	I graduated high school in May,
689.749	and I decided that I was going to start up a company
692.589	to commercialize these technologies that I've developed,
694.957	these revolutionary detectors for scanning cargo containers
697.814	and these systems to produce medical isotopes,
700.094	but I want to do this, and I've slowly been building up
703.542	a team of some of the most incredible people
705.795	I've ever had the chance to work with,
707.982	and I'm really prepared to make this a reality.
710.744	And I think, I think, that looking at the technology,
713.841	this will be cheaper than or the same price as natural gas,
719.191	and you don't have to refuel it for 30 years,
720.991	which is an advantage for the developing world.
723.718	And I'll just say one more maybe philosophical thing
726.84	to end with, which is weird for a scientist.
728.769	But I think there's something really poetic
731.263	about using nuclear power to propel us to the stars,
735.062	because the stars are giant fusion reactors.
737.817	They're giant nuclear cauldrons in the sky.
740.158	The energy that I'm able to talk to you today,
743.555	while it was converted to chemical energy in my food,
745.65	originally came from a nuclear reaction,
748.838	and so there's something poetic about, in my opinion,
751.614	perfecting nuclear fission
754.583	and using it as a future source of innovative energy.
758.302	So thank you guys.
760.253	(Applause)
