12.18	It's six o'clock in the morning,
14.42	pitch black outside.
16.46	My 14-year-old son
16.46	is fast asleep in his bed,
19.7	sleeping the reckless,
19.7	deep sleep of a teenager.
23.82	I flip on the light and physically
23.82	shake the poor boy awake,
27.82	because I know that,
27.82	like ripping off a Band-Aid,
30.46	it's better to get it over with quickly.
32.42	(Laughter)
34.1	"I have a friend who yells ""Fire!"""
34.1	just to rouse her sleeping teen.
38.86	And another who got so fed up
40.86	that she had to dump cold water
40.86	on her son's head
43.74	just to get him out of bed.
46.42	Sound brutal ...
48.18	but perhaps familiar?
51.42	Every morning I ask myself,
54.3	"""How can I --"
55.9	knowing what I know
57.66	and doing what I do for a living --
60.1	"be doing this to my own son?"""
62.86	You see,
64.18	I'm a sleep researcher.
65.9	(Laughter)
68.1	So I know far too much about sleep
69.94	and the consequences of sleep loss.
72.66	I know that I'm depriving my son
72.66	of the sleep he desperately needs
76.779	as a rapidly growing teenager.
79.18	I also know that by waking him up
81.46	hours before his natural
81.46	biological clock tells him he's ready,
86.14	I'm literally robbing him
86.14	of his dreams --
89.22	the type of sleep most associated
89.22	with learning, memory consolidation
95.02	and emotional processing.
97.58	But it's not just my kid
97.58	that's being deprived of sleep.
101.58	Sleep deprivation among
101.58	American teenagers is an epidemic.
106.18	Only about one in 10 gets
106.18	the eight to 10 hours of sleep per night
110.7	recommended by sleep scientists
110.7	and pediatricians.
115.1	Now, if you're thinking to yourself,
116.86	"""Phew, we're doing good,"
116.86	"my kid's getting eight hours,"""
120.14	remember,
121.38	eight hours is
121.38	the minimum recommendation.
124.9	You're barely passing.
126.98	Eight hours is kind of like
126.98	getting a C on your report card.
130.78	There are many factors
130.78	contributing to this epidemic,
134.42	but a major factor preventing teens
134.42	from getting the sleep they need
138.98	is actually a matter of public policy.
141.98	Not hormones, social lives or Snapchat.
147.34	Across the country,
148.62	many schools are starting
148.62	around 7:30am or earlier,
153.5	despite the fact that major
153.5	medical organizations recommend
157.62	that middle and high school
157.62	start no earlier than 8:30am.
163.06	These early start policies
163.06	have a direct effect on how much --
167.22	or really how little sleep
167.22	American teenagers are getting.
172.34	They're also pitting
172.34	teenagers and their parents
176.26	in a fundamentally unwinnable fight
176.26	against their own bodies.
181.18	Around the time of puberty,
183.02	teenagers experience a delay
183.02	in their biological clock,
186.78	which determines when we feel most awake
186.78	and when we feel most sleepy.
191.34	This is driven in part by a shift
191.34	in the release of the hormone melatonin.
195.9	Teenagers' bodies wait to start releasing
195.9	melatonin until around 11pm,
201.46	which is two hours later than what
201.46	we see in adults or younger children.
207.66	This means that waking a teenager up
207.66	at 6am is the biological equivalent
213.7	of waking an adult up at 4am.
217.58	On the unfortunate days
217.58	when I have to wake up at 4am,
221.58	I'm a zombie.
222.94	Functionally useless.
224.7	I can't think straight,
226.34	I'm irritable,
227.86	and I probably shouldn't be driving a car.
231.5	But this is how many American
231.5	teenagers feel every single school day.
236.1	In fact, many of the, shall we say,
239.14	unpleasant characteristics
239.14	that we chalk up to being a teenager --
243.5	moodiness, irritability,
243.5	laziness, depression --
246.94	could be a product
246.94	of chronic sleep deprivation.
250.9	For many teens
250.9	battling chronic sleep loss,
253.66	their go-to strategy to compensate
253.66	is consuming large quantities of caffeine
259.18	in the form of venti frappuccinos,
261.38	or energy drinks and shots.
263.9	So essentially,
265.14	we've got an entire population
265.14	of tired but wired youth.
273.42	Advocates of sleep-friendly
273.42	start times know
277.06	that adolescence is a period
277.06	of dramatic brain development,
280.62	particularly in the parts of the brain
282.7	that are responsible for those
282.7	higher order thinking processes,
286.26	including reasoning, problem-solving
286.26	and good judgment.
291.14	In other words, the very type
291.14	of brain activity that's responsible
294.3	for reining in those impulsive
294.3	and often risky behaviors
298.9	that are so characteristic of adolescence
301.86	and that are so terrifying
301.86	to us parents of teenagers.
306.42	They know that like the rest of us,
308.34	when teenagers don't
308.34	get the sleep they need,
310.78	their brains, their bodies
310.78	and behaviors suffer
313.94	with both immediate and lasting effects.
317.1	They can't concentrate,
318.94	their attention plummets
320.86	and many will even show
320.86	behavioral signs that mimic ADHD.
326.14	But the consequences of teen sleep loss
326.14	go well beyond the classroom,
330.58	sadly contributing to many
330.58	of the mental health problems
334.22	that skyrocket during adolescence,
336.94	including substance use,
338.78	depression and suicide.
342.22	In our work with teens
342.22	from LA Unified School District,
345.42	we found that teens with sleep problems
347.66	were 55 percent more likely
347.66	to have used alcohol in the past month.
352.9	In another study with over
356.82	they found that
356.82	for each hour of lost sleep,
360.42	there was a 38 percent increase
360.42	in feeling sad or hopeless,
365.22	and a 58 percent increase
365.22	in teen suicide attempts.
370.42	And if that's not enough,
372.7	teens who skip out on sleep
372.7	are at increased risk
375.26	for a host of physical health problems
375.26	that plague our country,
379.34	including obesity,
379.34	heart disease and diabetes.
384.58	Then there's the risk
384.58	of putting a sleep-deprived teen,
387.5	with a newly minted driver's license,
390.06	behind the wheel.
391.98	Studies have shown that getting five hours
391.98	or less of sleep per night
396.5	is the equivalent of driving with a blood
396.5	alcohol content above the legal limit.
408.02	Advocates of sleep-friendly start times,
410.54	and researchers in this area,
412.62	have produced tremendous science
414.82	showing the tremendous benefits
414.82	of later start times.
418.74	The findings are unequivocal,
421.06	and as a sleep scientist,
422.78	I rarely get to speak
422.78	with that kind of certainty.
426.98	Teens from districts
426.98	with later start times get more sleep.
430.82	To the naysayers who may think
430.82	that if schools start later,
434.34	teens will just stay up later,
436.74	the truth is,
438.02	their bedtimes stay the same,
439.98	but their wake-up times get extended,
442.26	resulting in more sleep.
445.18	They're more likely to show up for school;
447.58	school absences dropped
447.58	by 25 percent in one district.
451.5	And they're less likely to drop out.
454.1	Not surprisingly,
454.1	they do better academically.
457.62	So this has real implications
457.62	for reducing the achievement gap.
462.38	Standardized test scores
462.38	in math and reading
465.1	go up by two to three percentage points.
468.14	That's as powerful as reducing class sizes
468.14	by one-third fewer students,
473.74	or replacing a so-so teacher
473.74	in the classroom
476.94	with a truly outstanding one.
480.26	Their mental and physical health improves,
482.82	and even their families are happier.
485.18	I mean, who wouldn't enjoy a little
485.18	more pleasantness from our teens,
490.02	and a little less crankiness?
492.86	Even their communities are safer
494.74	because car crash rates go down --
497.3	a 70 percent reduction in one district.
501.22	Given these tremendous benefits,
503.66	you might think,
505.02	well, this is a no-brainer, right?
507.74	So why have we as a society
507.74	failed to heed this call?
513.5	Often the argument against later
513.5	start times goes something like this:
517.82	"""Why should we delay"
517.82	start times for teenagers?
520.14	We need to toughen them up
520.14	"so they're ready for the real world!"""
524.02	But that's like saying
524.02	to the parent of a two-year-old,
526.94	"""Don't let Johnny nap,"
528.46	"or he won't be ready for kindergarten."""
530.9	(Laughter)
533.7	Delaying start times also presents
533.7	many logistical challenges.
537.62	Not just for students and their families,
540.02	but for communities as a whole.
542.42	Updating bus routes,
544.02	increased transportation costs,
546.1	impact on sports,
547.66	care before or after school.
550.1	These are the same concerns
550.1	that come up in district after district,
554.7	time and again around the country
556.7	as school start times are debated.
559.78	And they're legitimate concerns,
562.46	but these are problems
562.46	we have to work through.
565.94	They are not valid excuses
568.22	for failing to do the right thing
568.22	for our children,
571.74	which is to start middle and high schools
571.74	no earlier than 8:30am.
577.58	And in districts around the country,
579.5	big and small,
579.5	who have made this change,
582.14	they found that these fears
582.14	are often unfounded
585.94	and far outweighed by the tremendous
585.94	benefits for student health
590.38	and performance,
592.06	and our collective public safety.
595.98	So tomorrow morning,
597.78	when coincidentally we get
597.78	to set our clocks back by an hour
603.58	and you get that delicious
603.58	extra hour of sleep,
609.1	and the day seems a little longer,
611.9	and a little more full of hope,
614.58	think about the tremendous power of sleep.
619.34	And think about what a gift it would be
621.94	for our children to be able
621.94	to wake up naturally,
625.98	in harmony with their own biology.
629.22	Thank you,
630.5	and pleasant dreams.
