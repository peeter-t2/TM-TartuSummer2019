25	So my grandfather told me when I was a little girl,
27	"""If you say a word often enough, it becomes you."""
30	And having grown up in a segregated city, Baltimore, Maryland,
33	I sort of use that idea to go around America with a tape recorder --
36	thank God for technology --
38	to interview people, thinking that if I walked in their words --
41	which is also why I don't wear shoes when I perform --
43	if I walked in their words, that I could sort of absorb America.
47	I was also inspired by Walt Whitman,
48	who wanted to absorb America and have it absorb him.
51	So these four characters are going to be from that work
55	that I've been doing for many years now,
56	and well over, I don't know, a couple of thousand people
59	I've interviewed.
60	Anybody out here old enough to know Studs Terkel, that old radio man?
65	So I thought he would be the perfect person
67	to go to to ask about a defining moment in American history.
71	"You know, he was ""born in 1912, the year the Titanic sank,"
75	greatest ship every built. Hits the tip of an iceberg,
78	"and bam, it went down. It went down and I came up. Wow, some century."""
86	(Laughter)
88	So this is his answer about a defining moment in American history.
92	"""Defining moment in American history, I don't think there's one;"
97	you can't say Hiroshima, that's a big one --
99	I can't think of any one moment I would say is a defining moment.
102	The gradual slippage -- 'slippage' is the word
105	used by the people in Watergate, moral slippage --
108	it's a gradual kind of thing, combination of things.
110	You see, we also have the technology.
113	I say, less and less the human touch.
116	"""Oh, let me kind of tell you a funny little play bit."
119	The Atlanta airport is a modern airport,
121	and they should leave the gate there.
122	These trains that take you out to a concourse and on to a destination.
127	And these trains are smooth,
129	and they're quiet and they're efficient.
132	And there's a voice on the train, you know the voice was a human voice.
136	You see in the old days we had robots, robots imitated humans.
141	Now we have humans imitating robots.
146	So we got this voice on this train: Concourse One: Omaha, Lincoln.
152	Concourse Two: Dallas, Fort Worth. Same voice.
155	Just as a train is about to go, a young couple rush in
160	and they're just about to close the pneumatic doors.
163	And that voice, without losing a beat, says,
166	'Because of late entry, we're delayed 30 seconds.'
169	Just then, everybody's looking at this couple with hateful eyes
174	and the couple's going like this, you know, shrinking.
176	Well, I'd happened to have had a couple of drinks before boarding --
179	I do that to steel my nerves -- and so
182	I imitate a train call, holding my hand on my --
185	'George Orwell, your time has come,' you see.
189	Well, some of you are laughing. Everybody laughs
191	when I say that, but not on this train. Silence.
195	And so suddenly they're looking at me.
196	So here I am with the couple, the three of us
199	shrinking at the foot of Calvary about to be up, you know.
203	"""Just then I see a baby, a little baby in the lap of a mother."
210	I know it's Hispanic because she's speaking Spanish to her companion.
215	So I'm going to talk to the baby. So I say to the baby,
218	holding my hand over my mouth because my breath must be 100 proof,
222	I say to the baby, 'Sir or Madam,
226	what is your considered opinion of the human species?'
231	And the baby looks, you know, the way babies look at you clearly,
233	starts laughing,
234	starts busting out with this crazy little laugh.
237	I say, 'Thank God for a human reaction, we haven't lost yet.'
241	"""But you see, the human touch, you see, it's disappearing."
243	You know, you see, you've got to question the official truth.
246	You know the thing that was so great about Mark Twain --
249	you know we honor Mark Twain, but we don't read him.
253	We read 'Huck Finn,' of course, we read 'Huck Finn' of course.
256	I mean, Huck, of course, was tremendous.
258	Remember that great scene on the raft, remember what Huck did?
261	You see, here's Huck; he's an illiterate kid; he's had no schooling,
264	but there's something in him.
266	And the official truth, the truth was, the law was,
269	that a black man was a property, was a thing, you see.
272	And Huck gets on the raft with a property named Jim, a slave, see.
276	And he hears that Jim is going to go and take his wife and kids
280	and steal them from the woman who owns them,
282	and Huck says, 'Ooh, oh my God, ooh, ooh --
286	that woman, that woman never did anybody any harm.
289	Ooh, he's going to steal; he's going to steal;
290	he's going to do a terrible thing.'
292	Just then, two slavers caught up, guys chasing slaves, looking for Jim.
297	'Anybody up on that raft with you?' Huck says, 'Yeah.'
306	'Is he black or white?' 'White.' And they go off.
313	And Huck said, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I lied, I lied, ooh,
317	I did a terrible thing, did a terrible thing -- why do I feel so good?'
322	"""But it's the goodness of Huck, that stuff that Huck's been made of,"
324	you see, all been buried; it's all been buried.
326	So the human touch, you see, it's disappearing.
329	So you ask about a defining moment --
331	ain't no defining moment in American history for me.
333	It's an accretion of moments that add up to where we are now,
336	where trivia becomes news.
338	And more and more, less and less awareness of the pain of the other.
344	Huh. You know, I don't know if you could use this or not,
348	but I was quoting Wright Morris, a writer from Nebraska, who says,
352	'We're more and more into communications
355	and less and less into communication.'
360	"Okay, kids, I got to scram, got to go see my cardiologist."""
365	And that's Studs Terkel.
366	(Applause)
372	So, talk about risk taking. I'm going to do somebody that nobody likes.
379	You know, most actors want to do characters that are likeable --
384	well, not always, but the notion, especially at a conference like this,
387	I like to inspire people.
389	"But since this was called ""risk taking,"""
391	I'm doing somebody who I never do, because she's so unlikeable
395	that one person actually came backstage
396	and told me to take her out of the show she was in.
400	And I'm doing her because I think we think of risk,
403	at a conference like this, as a good thing.
405	"But there are certain other connotations to the word ""risk,"""
408	"and the same thing about the word ""nature."" What is nature?"
411	Maxine Greene, who's a wonderful philosopher
414	who's as old as Studs, and was the head of a philosophy --
418	great, big philosophy kind of an organization --
422	I went to her and asked her what are the two things
424	that she doesn't know, that she still wants to know.
427	"And she said, ""Well, personally, I still feel like I have to curtsey"
429	when I see the president of my university.
432	And I still feel as though I've got to get coffee
434	"for my male colleagues, even though I've outlived most of them."""
436	"And she said, ""And then intellectually,"
439	I don't know enough about the negative imagination.
442	And September 11th certainly taught us
444	"that that's a whole area we don't investigate."""
446	So this piece is about a negative imagination.
449	It raises questions about what nature is, what Mother Nature is,
453	and about what a risk can be.
455	And I got this in the Maryland Correctional Institute for Women.
457	Everything I do is word for word off a tape.
460	And I title things because I think people speak in organic poems,
464	"and this is called ""A Mirror to Her Mouth."""
465	And this is an inmate named Paulette Jenkins.
476	"""I began to learn how to cover it up,"
480	because I didn't want nobody to know that this was happening in my home.
485	I want everybody to think we were a normal family.
488	I mean we had all the materialistic things,
491	but that didn't make my children pain any less;
494	that didn't make their fears subside.
497	I ran out of excuses about how we got black eyes
500	and busted lips and bruises. I didn't had no more excuses.
504	And he beat me too. But that didn't change the fact
507	that it was a nightmare for my family; it was a nightmare.
511	And I failed them dramatically,
513	because I allowed it to go on and on and on.
517	"""But the night that Myesha got killed --"
519	and the intensity just grew and grew and grew,
523	until one night we came home from getting drugs,
528	and he got angry with Myesha, and he started beating her,
531	and he put her in a bathtub. Oh, he would use a belt.
534	He had a belt because he had this warped perverted thing
537	that Myesha was having sex with her little brother
539	and they was fondling each other -- that would be his reason.
541	I'm just talking about the particular night that she died.
545	And so he put her in the bathtub,
548	and I was in the bedroom with the baby.
549	"""And four months before this happened, four months before Myesha died,"
553	I thought I could really fix this man. So I had a baby by him -- insane --
559	thinking that if I gave him his own kid, he would leave mine alone.
562	And it didn't work, didn't work.
566	And I ended up with three children, Houston, Myesha and Dominic,
570	who was four months old when I came to jail.
573	"""And I was in the bedroom. Like I said, he had her in the bathroom"
575	and he -- he -- every time he hit her, she would fall.
580	And she would hit her head on the tub. It happened continuously, repeatedly.
585	I could hear it, but I dared not to move. I didn't move.
589	I didn't even go and see what was happening.
591	I just sat there and listened.
594	And then he put her in the hallway.
599	He told her, just set there. And so she set there for about four or five hours.
606	And then he told her, get up.
609	And when she got up, she says she couldn't see.
612	Her face was bruised. She had a black eye.
617	All around her head was just swollen;
619	her head was about two sizes of its own size.
625	I told him, 'Let her go to sleep.' He let her go to sleep.
632	"""The next morning she was dead."
637	He went in to check on her for school, and he got very excited.
640	He says, 'She won't breathe.'
642	I knew immediately that she was dead.
646	I didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead, so I went in
649	and I put a mirror to her mouth --
651	there was no thing, nothing, coming out of her mouth.
655	He said, he said, he said,
656	'We can't, we can't let nobody find out about this.'
658	He say, 'You've got to help me.' I agree. I agree.
662	"""I mean, I've been keeping a secret for years and years and years,"
665	so it just seemed like second hand to me, just to keep on keeping it a secret.
669	So we went to the mall and we told a police that we had, like, lost her,
675	that she was missing.
678	We told a security guard that she was missing,
684	though she wasn't missing.
686	And we told the security guard what we had put on her
688	and we went home and we dressed her in exactly the same thing
691	that we had told the security guard that we had put on her.
695	"""And then we got the baby and my other child,"
700	and we drove out to, like, I-95.
707	I was so petrified and so numb,
710	all I could look was in the rear-view mirror.
715	And he just laid her right on the shoulder of the highway.
725	"My own child, I let that happen to."""
735	So that's an investigation of the negative imagination.
740	(Applause)
745	When I started this project
747	"called ""On the Road: A Search For an American Character"""
749	with my tape recorder, I thought that I was going to go around America
751	and find it in all its aspects -- bull riders, cowboys, pig farmers,
756	drum majorettes -- but I sort of got tripped on race relations,
760	because my first big show was a show about a race riot.
763	And so I went to both -- two race riots,
766	one of which was the Los Angeles riot. And this next piece is from that.
769	Because this is what I would say
771	I've learned the most about race relations, from this piece.
775	It's a kind of an aria, I would say, and in many tapes that I have.
779	Everybody knows that the Los Angeles riots happened
782	because four cops beat up a black man named Rodney King.
785	It was captured on videotape -- technology --
787	and it was played all over the world.
789	Everybody thought the four cops would go to jail.
790	They did not, so there were riots.
793	And what a lot of people forget, is there was a second trial,
795	ordered by George Bush, Sr.
797	And that trial came back with two cops going to jail
802	and two cops declared innocent. I was at that trial.
805	And I mean, the people just danced in the streets
807	because they were afraid there was going to be another riot.
809	Explosion of joy that this verdict had come back this way.
812	So there was a community that didn't -- the Korean-Americans,
816	whose stores had been burned to the ground.
818	And so this woman, Mrs. Young-Soon Han,
820	I suppose will have taught me the most that I have learned about race.
824	And she asks also a question that Studs talks about:
827	"this notion of the ""official truth,"" to question the ""official truth."""
830	So what she's questioning here, she's taking a chance
832	and questioning what justice is in society.
835	"And this is called, ""Swallowing the Bitterness."""
839	"""I used to believe America was the best."
844	I watched in Korea many luxurious Hollywood lifestyle movie.
852	I never saw any poor man, any black.
857	Until 1992, I used to believe America was the best -- I still do;
861	I don't deny that because I am a victim.
865	But at the end of '92, when we were in such turmoil,
870	and having all the financial problems, and all the mental problems,
874	I began to really realize that Koreans
878	are completely left out of this society and we are nothing.
885	Why? Why do we have to be left out?
888	We didn't qualify for medical treatment, no food stamp, no GR,
894	no welfare, anything. Many African-Americans who never work
901	got minimum amount of money to survive.
905	We didn't get any because we have a car and a house.
913	And we are high taxpayer. Where do I find justice?
924	"""OK. OK? OK. OK."
931	Many African-Americans probably think that they won by the trial.
935	I was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict,
938	and all the day they were having a party, they celebrated,
942	all of South Central, all the churches. And they say,
945	'Well, finally justice has been done in this society.'
951	Well, what about victims' rights?
954	They got their rights by destroying innocent Korean merchants.
967	They have a lot of respect, as I do, for Dr. Martin King.
974	He is the only model for black community; I don't care Jesse Jackson.
981	He is the model of non-violence, non-violence --
985	and they would all like to be in his spirit.
990	"""But what about 1992? They destroyed innocent people."
997	And I wonder if that is really justice
1001	for them, to get their rights in that way.
1008	I was swallowing the bitterness, sitting here alone and watching them.
1017	They became so hilarious, but I was happy for them.
1024	I was glad for them. At least they got something back, OK.
1029	Let's just forget about Korean victims and other victims
1036	who were destroyed by them.
1041	They fought for their rights for over two centuries,
1050	and maybe because they sacrifice other minorities,
1053	Hispanic, Asian, we would suffer more in the mainstream.
1058	That's why I understand;
1059	that's why I have a mixed feeling about the verdict.
1062	"""But I wish that, I wish that, I wish that"
1067	I could be part of the enjoyment.
1070	I wish that I could live together with black people.
1077	But after the riot, it's too much difference.
1087	The fire is still there. How do you say it? [Unclear].
1094	Igniting, igniting, igniting fire. Igniting fire.
1102	"It's still there; it can burst out anytime."""
1114	Mrs. Young-Soon Han.
1116	(Applause)
1124	The other reason that I don't wear shoes
1128	is just in case I really feel like I have to cuddle up
1131	and get into the feet of somebody,
1133	walking really in somebody else's shoes.
1135	And I told you that in -- you know, I didn't give you the year,
1138	but in '79 I thought that I was going to go around
1141	and find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that,
1143	and I got sidetracked on race relations.
1146	Finally, I did find a bull rider, two years ago.
1149	And I've been going to the rodeos with him, and we've bonded.
1152	And he's the lead in an op-ed I did about the Republican Convention.
1157	He's a Republican -- I won't say anything about my party affiliation, but anyway --
1162	so this is my dear, dear Brent Williams,
1166	and this is on toughness,
1167	in case anybody needs to know about being tough
1170	for the work that you do. I think there's a real lesson in this.
1173	"And this is called ""Toughness."""
1176	"""Well, I'm an optimist. I mean basically I'm an optimist."
1181	I mean, you know, I mean, it's like my wife, Jolene,
1183	her family's always saying,
1185	you know, you ever think he's just a born loser?
1187	It seems like he has so much bad luck, you know.
1189	But then when that bull stepped on my kidney, you know,
1191	I didn't lose my kidney -- I could have lost my kidney,
1193	I kept my kidney, so I don't think I'm a born loser.
1195	I think that's good luck.
1196	(Laughter)
1198	"""And, I mean, funny things like this happen."
1200	I was in a doctor's office last CAT scan,
1204	and there was a Reader's Digest, October 2002.
1207	It was like, 'seven ways to get lucky.' And it says
1210	if you want to get lucky,
1211	you know, you've got to be around positive people.
1213	I mean, like even when I told my wife that you want to come out here
1217	and talk to me, she's like, 'She's just talking;
1219	she's just being nice to you. She's not going to do that.'
1221	"""And then you called me up and you said you wanted to come out here"
1223	and interview me and she went and looked you up on the Internet.
1225	She said, 'Look who she is.
1227	You're not even going to be able to answer her questions.'
1229	(Laughter)
1233	And she was saying you're going to make me look like an idiot
1235	because I've never been to college,
1236	and I wouldn't be talking professional or anything.
1238	I said, 'Well look, the woman talked to me for four hours.
1240	You know, if I wasn't talking -- you know,
1242	like, you know, she wanted me to talk,
1243	I don't think she would even come out here.'
1248	"""Confidence? Well, I think I ride"
1251	more out of determination than confidence.
1254	I mean, confidence is like, you know,
1255	you've been on that bull before; you know you can ride him.
1257	I mean, confidence is kind of like being cocky, but in a good way.
1261	But determination, you know, it's like just, you know, 'Fuck the form,
1264	get the horn.'
1266	(Laughter)
1270	That's Tuff Hedeman, in the movie '8 Seconds.'
1272	I mean, like, Pat O'Mealey always said when I was a boy,
1274	he say, 'You know, you got more try than any kid I ever seen.'
1277	And try and determination is the same thing.
1279	Determination is, like, you're going to hang on that bull,
1281	even if you're riding upside down.
1283	Determination's like, you're going to ride
1285	till your head hits the back of the dirt.
1288	"""Freedom? It would have to be the rodeo."
1292	"""Beauty? I don't think I know what beauty is."
1297	Well, you know, I guess that'd have to be the rodeo too.
1299	I mean, look how we are, the roughy family,
1300	palling around and shaking hands and wrestling around me.
1303	It's like, you know, racking up our credit cards on entry fees and gas.
1306	We ride together, we, you know, we, we eat together
1309	and we sleep together.
1310	I mean, I can't even imagine what it's going to be like
1313	the last day I rodeo. I mean, I'll be alright.
1315	I mean, I have my ranch and everything,
1316	but I actually don't even want to think the day that comes.
1319	I mean, I guess it just be like --
1321	I guess it be like the day my brother died.
1325	"""Toughness? Well, we was in West Jordan, Utah, and this bull"
1330	shoved my face right through the metal shoots in a --
1333	you know, busted my face all up and had to go to the hospital.
1336	And they had to sew me up and straighten my nose out.
1338	And I had to go and ride in the rodeo that night,
1340	so I didn't want them to put me under anesthesia,
1343	or whatever you call it. And so they sewed my face up.
1346	And then they had to straighten out my nose,
1348	and they took these rods and shoved them up my nose
1351	and went up through my brains
1353	and felt like it was coming out the top of my head,
1355	and everybody said that it should have killed me,
1357	but it didn't, because I guess I have a high tolerance for pain.
1361	(Laughter)
1364	But the good thing was, once they shoved those rods up there
1367	and straightened my nose out, I could breathe,
1369	and I hadn't been able to breathe
1371	"since I broke my nose in the high school rodeo."""
1374	Thank you.
1376	(Applause)
