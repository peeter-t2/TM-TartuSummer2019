13.08	Space, the final frontier.
17.88	I first heard these words
17.88	when I was just six years old,
21.36	and I was completely inspired.
23.64	I wanted to explore strange new worlds.
26.04	I wanted to seek out new life.
27.56	I wanted to see everything
27.56	that the universe had to offer.
31.84	And those dreams, those words,
31.84	they took me on a journey,
35.56	a journey of discovery,
37.04	through school, through university,
39.24	to do a PhD and finally
39.24	to become a professional astronomer.
43.92	Now, I learned two amazing things,
46.96	one slightly unfortunate,
48.52	when I was doing my PhD.
50.6	I learned that the reality was
53.04	I wouldn't be piloting
53.04	a starship anytime soon.
57.44	But I also learned that the universe
57.44	is strange, wonderful and vast,
62.08	actually too vast
62.08	to be explored by spaceship.
65.72	And so I turned my attention
65.72	to astronomy, to using telescopes.
69.84	Now, I show you before you
69.84	an image of the night sky.
72.64	You might see it anywhere in the world.
75.04	And all of these stars are part
75.04	of our local galaxy, the Milky Way.
79.56	Now, if you were to go
79.56	to a darker part of the sky,
82.28	a nice dark site, perhaps in the desert,
84.84	you might see the center
84.84	of our Milky Way galaxy
87.28	spread out before you,
87.28	hundreds of billions of stars.
90.84	And it's a very beautiful image.
92.44	It's colorful.
93.8	And again, this is just
93.8	a local corner of our universe.
97.44	You can see there's
97.44	a sort of strange dark dust across it.
100.76	Now, that is local dust
102.76	that's obscuring the light of the stars.
105.44	But we can do a pretty good job.
107.04	Just with our own eyes, we can explore
107.04	our little corner of the universe.
110.52	It's possible to do better.
111.88	You can use wonderful telescopes
111.88	like the Hubble Space Telescope.
116.2	Now, astronomers
116.2	have put together this image.
118.4	It's called the Hubble Deep Field,
120.32	and they've spent hundreds of hours
120.32	observing just a tiny patch of the sky
124.68	no larger than your thumbnail
124.68	held at arm's length.
127.52	And in this image
128.8	you can see thousands of galaxies,
130.48	and we know that there must be
130.48	hundreds of millions, billions of galaxies
133.96	in the entire universe,
135.36	some like our own and some very different.
138.04	So you think, OK, well,
138.04	I can continue this journey.
140.72	This is easy. I can just
140.72	use a very powerful telescope
143.44	and just look at the sky, no problem.
145.96	It's actually really missing out
145.96	if we just do that.
150	Now, that's because
150	everything I've talked about so far
152.76	is just using the visible spectrum,
152.76	just the thing that your eyes can see,
156.68	and that's a tiny slice,
158.12	a tiny, tiny slice
158.12	of what the universe has to offer us.
162.16	Now, there's also two very important
162.16	problems with using visible light.
166.92	Not only are we missing out
166.92	on all the other processes
169.68	that are emitting other kinds of light,
172.88	but there's two issues.
174.32	Now, the first is that dust
174.32	that I mentioned earlier.
177.72	The dust stops the visible light
177.72	from getting to us.
180.68	So as we look deeper
180.68	into the universe, we see less light.
185.4	The dust stops it getting to us.
187.52	But there's a really strange problem
187.52	with using visible light
190.96	in order to try and explore the universe.
193.64	Now take a break for a minute.
195.92	Say you're standing on a corner,
195.92	a busy street corner.
199.08	There's cars going by.
200.6	An ambulance approaches.
202.84	It has a high-pitched siren.
204.24	(Imitates a siren passing by)
208	The siren appeared to change in pitch
210.36	as it moved towards and away from you.
212.96	The ambulance driver did not change
212.96	the siren just to mess with you.
218.04	That was a product of your perception.
220.64	The sound waves,
220.64	as the ambulance approached,
223.4	were compressed,
224.64	and they changed higher in pitch.
226.6	As the ambulance receded,
226.6	the sound waves were stretched,
229.4	and they sounded lower in pitch.
231.48	The same thing happens with light.
234.04	Objects moving towards us,
236.44	their light waves are compressed
236.44	and they appear bluer.
239.64	Objects moving away from us,
241.88	their light waves are stretched,
241.88	and they appear redder.
244.56	So we call these effects
244.56	blueshift and redshift.
248.44	Now, our universe is expanding,
251.4	so everything is moving away
251.4	from everything else,
255.6	and that means
255.6	everything appears to be red.
259.04	And oddly enough, as you look
259.04	more deeply into the universe,
262.8	more distant objects
262.8	are moving away further and faster,
267.12	so they appear more red.
269.56	So if I come back to the Hubble Deep Field
272.519	and we were to continue
272.519	to peer deeply into the universe
275.24	just using the Hubble,
276.8	as we get to a certain distance away,
279.52	everything becomes red,
281.92	and that presents something of a problem.
283.92	Eventually, we get so far away
286	everything is shifted into the infrared
289	and we can't see anything at all.
291.68	So there must be a way around this.
293.4	Otherwise, I'm limited in my journey.
295.24	I wanted to explore the whole universe,
297.16	not just whatever I can see,
297.16	you know, before the redshift kicks in.
302.16	There is a technique.
303.44	It's called radio astronomy.
304.84	Astronomers have been
304.84	using this for decades.
307.2	It's a fantastic technique.
308.52	I show you the Parkes Radio Telescope,
308.52	"affectionately known as ""The Dish."""
312.04	You may have seen the movie.
313.84	And radio is really brilliant.
315.44	It allows us to peer much more deeply.
318	It doesn't get stopped by dust,
320.72	so you can see everything in the universe,
323	and redshift is less of a problem
324.88	because we can build receivers
324.88	that receive across a large band.
328.6	So what does Parkes see when we turn it
328.6	to the center of the Milky Way?
332.56	We should see something fantastic, right?
335.16	Well, we do see something interesting.
338.08	All that dust has gone.
339.76	As I mentioned, radio goes
339.76	straight through dust, so not a problem.
343.84	But the view is very different.
345.76	We can see that the center
345.76	of the Milky Way is aglow,
349.6	and this isn't starlight.
351.96	This is a light called
351.96	synchrotron radiation,
355.12	and it's formed from electrons
355.12	spiraling around cosmic magnetic fields.
360.28	So the plane is aglow with this light.
363.4	And we can also see
363.4	strange tufts coming off of it,
366.72	and objects which don't appear to line up
369.24	with anything that we can see
369.24	with our own eyes.
372.52	But it's hard to really
372.52	interpret this image,
374.68	because as you can see,
374.68	it's very low resolution.
377.48	Radio waves have a wavelength that's long,
379.68	and that makes their resolution poorer.
382	This image is also black and white,
384.08	so we don't really know
384.08	what is the color of everything in here.
388.64	Well, fast-forward to today.
390.04	We can build telescopes
391.52	which can get over these problems.
394.16	Now, I'm showing you here an image
394.16	of the Murchison Radio Observatory,
397.52	a fantastic place
397.52	to build radio telescopes.
400.32	It's flat, it's dry,
402.64	and most importantly, it's radio quiet:
405.64	no mobile phones, no Wi-Fi, nothing,
408.76	just very, very radio quiet,
411.28	so a perfect place
411.28	to build a radio telescope.
414.88	Now, the telescope that I've been
414.88	working on for a few years
417.76	is called the Murchison Widefield Array,
419.72	and I'm going to show you
419.72	a little time lapse of it being built.
422.76	This is a group of undergraduate
422.76	and postgraduate students
426.04	located in Perth.
427.32	We call them the Student Army,
429.08	and they volunteered their time
429.08	to build a radio telescope.
431.92	There's no course credit for this.
434.32	And they're putting together
434.32	these radio dipoles.
437.24	They just receive at low frequencies,
437.24	a bit like your FM radio or your TV.
443	And here we are deploying them
443	across the desert.
446.12	The final telescope
446.12	covers 10 square kilometers
448.56	of the Western Australian desert.
450.72	And the interesting thing is,
450.72	there's no moving parts.
453.72	We just deploy these little antennas
456	essentially on chicken mesh.
457.88	It's fairly cheap.
459.32	Cables take the signals
461.32	from the antennas
463.4	and bring them
463.4	to central processing units.
465.96	And it's the size of this telescope,
467.76	the fact that we've built it
467.76	over the entire desert
470.44	that gives us a better
470.44	resolution than Parkes.
473.88	Now, eventually all those cables
473.88	bring them to a unit
477.44	which sends it off
477.44	to a supercomputer here in Perth,
481	and that's where I come in.
483.32	(Sighs)
484.56	Radio data.
485.8	I have spent the last five years
487.64	working with very difficult,
487.64	very interesting data
490.52	that no one had really looked at before.
492.52	I've spent a long time calibrating it,
494.68	running millions of CPU hours
494.68	on supercomputers
498.6	and really trying to understand that data.
501.36	And with this telescope,
503.32	with this data,
504.6	we've performed a survey
504.6	of the entire southern sky,
508.56	the GaLactic and Extragalactic
508.56	All-sky MWA Survey,
513.68	or GLEAM, as I call it.
516.44	And I'm very excited.
517.92	This survey is just about to be published,
517.92	but it hasn't been shown yet,
521.325	so you are literally the first people
523.28	to see this southern survey
523.28	of the entire sky.
526.799	So I'm delighted to share with you
526.799	some images from this survey.
530.88	Now, imagine you went to the Murchison,
532.799	you camped out underneath the stars
534.919	and you looked towards the south.
536.56	You saw the south's celestial pole,
538.251	the galaxy rising.
539.48	If I fade in the radio light,
542.12	this is what we observe with our survey.
544.8	You can see that the galactic plane
544.8	is no longer dark with dust.
547.88	It's alight with synchrotron radiation,
550.32	and thousands of dots are in the sky.
552.84	Our large Magellanic Cloud,
552.84	our nearest galactic neighbor,
556.16	is orange instead
556.16	of its more familiar blue-white.
559.4	So there's a lot going on in this.
559.4	Let's take a closer look.
562.8	If we look back
562.8	towards the galactic center,
565.24	where we originally saw the Parkes image
565.24	that I showed you earlier,
568.48	low resolution, black and white,
570.88	and we fade to the GLEAM view,
574.2	you can see the resolution
574.2	has gone up by a factor of a hundred.
578.08	We now have a color view of the sky,
580.96	a technicolor view.
582.32	Now, it's not a false color view.
585.32	These are real radio colors.
588.6	What I've done is I've colored
588.6	the lowest frequencies red
591.44	and the highest frequencies blue,
593.08	and the middle ones green.
594.68	And that gives us this rainbow view.
596.92	And this isn't just false color.
599.2	The colors in this image
599.2	tell us about the physical processes
602.16	going on in the universe.
603.974	So for instance, if you look
603.974	along the plane of the galaxy,
606.76	it's alight with synchrotron,
608.24	which is mostly reddish orange,
610.64	but if we look very closely,
610.64	we see little blue dots.
614.32	Now, if we zoom in,
615.92	these blue dots are ionized plasma
618.48	around very bright stars,
620.68	and what happens
620.68	is that they block the red light,
623.48	so they appear blue.
625.88	And these can tell us
625.88	about these star-forming regions
628.84	in our galaxy.
630.12	And we just see them immediately.
631.76	We look at the galaxy,
631.76	and the color tells us that they're there.
634.84	You can see little soap bubbles,
636.44	little circular images
636.44	around the galactic plane,
639.88	and these are supernova remnants.
642.6	When a star explodes,
644.32	its outer shell is cast off
646.8	and it travels outward into space
646.8	gathering up material,
650.12	and it produces a little shell.
652.8	It's been a long-standing
652.8	mystery to astronomers
656.2	where all the supernova remnants are.
658.96	We know that there must be a lot
658.96	of high-energy electrons in the plane
663.32	to produce the synchrotron
663.32	radiation that we see,
666	and we think they're produced
666	by supernova remnants,
668.6	but there don't seem to be enough.
670.4	Fortunately, GLEAM is really, really
670.4	good at detecting supernova remnants,
674.32	so we're hoping to have
674.32	a new paper out on that soon.
677.8	Now, that's fine.
679.08	We've explored our little local universe,
681.44	but I wanted to go deeper,
681.44	I wanted to go further.
683.84	I wanted to go beyond the Milky Way.
686.52	Well, as it happens, we can see a very
686.52	interesting object in the top right,
690.32	and this is a local radio galaxy,
692.56	Centaurus A.
694.24	If we zoom in on this,
695.52	we can see that there are
695.52	two huge plumes going out into space.
699.6	And if you look right in the center
699.6	between those two plumes,
702.52	you'll see a galaxy just like our own.
704.92	It's a spiral. It has a dust lane.
707.4	It's a normal galaxy.
709.04	But these jets
709.04	are only visible in the radio.
712.68	If we looked in the visible,
712.68	we wouldn't even know they were there,
715.88	and they're thousands of times larger
715.88	than the host galaxy.
719.48	What's going on?
719.48	What's producing these jets?
723.16	At the center of every galaxy
723.16	that we know about
726.72	is a supermassive black hole.
729	Now, black holes are invisible.
729	That's why they're called that.
732.44	All you can see is the deflection
732.44	of the light around them,
735.48	and occasionally, when a star
735.48	or a cloud of gas comes into their orbit,
739.8	it is ripped apart by tidal forces,
742.56	forming what we call an accretion disk.
745.64	The accretion disk
745.64	glows brightly in the x-rays,
748.88	and huge magnetic fields
748.88	can launch the material into space
753.32	at nearly the speed of light.
755.52	So these jets are visible in the radio
759.24	and this is what we pick up in our survey.
762.04	Well, very well, so we've seen
762.04	one radio galaxy. That's nice.
766.08	But if you just look
766.08	at the top of that image,
768.28	you'll see another radio galaxy.
770.04	It's a little bit smaller,
770.04	and that's just because it's further away.
773.8	OK. Two radio galaxies.
776.48	We can see this. This is fine.
778.08	Well, what about all the other dots?
779.84	Presumably those are just stars.
781.88	They're not.
783.12	They're all radio galaxies.
785.32	Every single one of the dots in this image
788.24	is a distant galaxy,
790	millions to billions of light-years away
792.88	with a supermassive
792.88	black hole at its center
795.52	pushing material into space
795.52	at nearly the speed of light.
799.12	It is mind-blowing.
801.68	And this survey is even larger
801.68	than what I've shown here.
805.44	If we zoom out to
805.44	the full extent of the survey,
808	you can see I found 300,000
808	of these radio galaxies.
812.12	So it's truly an epic journey.
815.04	We've discovered all of these galaxies
817.72	right back to the very first
817.72	supermassive black holes.
821.96	I'm very proud of this,
821.96	and it will be published next week.
825.28	Now, that's not all.
828.12	I've explored the furthest reaches
828.12	of the galaxy with this survey,
832.48	but there's something
832.48	even more in this image.
836.32	Now, I'll take you right back
836.32	to the dawn of time.
839.64	When the universe formed,
839.64	it was a big bang,
843.32	which left the universe
843.32	as a sea of hydrogen,
847.4	neutral hydrogen.
848.92	And when the very first stars
848.92	and galaxies switched on,
851.72	they ionized that hydrogen.
853.84	So the universe went
853.84	from neutral to ionized.
858.16	That imprinted a signal all around us.
861.36	Everywhere, it pervades us,
863.12	like the Force.
864.56	Now, because that happened so long ago,
869	the signal was redshifted,
871.56	so now that signal
871.56	is at very low frequencies.
874.88	It's at the same frequency as my survey,
877.36	but it's so faint.
878.76	It's a billionth the size
878.76	of any of the objects in my survey.
883.32	So our telescope may not be quite
883.32	sensitive enough to pick up this signal.
888.24	However, there's a new radio telescope.
890.76	So I can't have a starship,
892.44	but I can hopefully have
893.72	one of the biggest
893.72	radio telescopes in the world.
896.6	We're building the Square Kilometre Array,
896.6	a new radio telescope,
900.24	and it's going to be a thousand
900.24	times bigger than the MWA,
903	a thousand times more sensitive,
903	and have an even better resolution.
906.24	So we should find
906.24	tens of millions of galaxies.
908.48	And perhaps, deep in that signal,
910.84	I will get to look upon the very first
910.84	stars and galaxies switching on,
915.04	the beginning of time itself.
917.92	Thank you.
919.16	(Applause)
