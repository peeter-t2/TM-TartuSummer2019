12.928	If you look deep into the night sky,
16.42	you see stars,
18.036	and if you look further, you see more stars,
20.608	and further, galaxies, and 
20.608	further, more galaxies.
22.767	But if you keep looking further and further,
26.64	eventually you see nothing for a long while,
29.756	and then finally you see a
29.756	faint, fading afterglow,
34.218	and it's the afterglow of the Big Bang.
37.242	Now, the Big Bang was an era in the early universe
40.059	when everything we see in the night sky
42.23	was condensed into an incredibly small,
44.64	incredibly hot, incredibly roiling mass,
48.966	and from it sprung everything we see.
51.658	Now, we've mapped that afterglow
54.517	with great precision,
56.196	and when I say we, I mean people who aren't me.
58.24	We've mapped the afterglow
60.116	with spectacular precision,
61.438	and one of the shocks about it
62.986	is that it's almost completely uniform.
65.932	Fourteen billion light years that way
67.89	and 14 billion light years that way,
69.75	it's the same temperature.
71.158	Now it's been 14 billion years
74.472	since that Big Bang,
76.29	and so it's got faint and cold.
78.762	It's now 2.7 degrees.
81.07	But it's not exactly 2.7 degrees.
83.35	It's only 2.7 degrees to about
87.486	Over here, it's a little hotter,
88.48	and over there, it's a little cooler,
90.348	and that's incredibly important
90.348	to everyone in this room,
93.436	because where it was a little hotter,
95.16	there was a little more stuff,
96.856	and where there was a little more stuff,
98.423	we have galaxies and clusters of galaxies
100.392	and superclusters
101.644	and all the structure you see in the cosmos.
104.352	And those small, little, inhomogeneities,
109.746	those were formed by quantum mechanical wiggles
112.5	in that early universe that were stretched
114.308	across the size of the entire cosmos.
116.587	That is spectacular,
118.301	and that's not what they found on Monday;
119.966	what they found on Monday is cooler.
122.002	So here's what they found on Monday:
124.268	Imagine you take a bell,
127.771	and you whack the bell with a hammer.
129.382	What happens? It rings.
131.058	But if you wait, that ringing fades
133.266	and fades and fades
134.886	until you don't notice it anymore.
136.828	Now, that early universe was incredibly dense,
139.476	like a metal, way denser,
141.555	and if you hit it, it would ring,
143.96	but the thing ringing would be
145.823	the structure of space-time itself,
147.911	and the hammer would be quantum mechanics.
150.727	What they found on Monday
152.658	was evidence of the ringing
155.02	of the space-time of the early universe,
157.335	what we call gravitational waves
159.44	from the fundamental era,
160.96	and here's how they found it.
162.935	Those waves have long since faded.
165.007	If you go for a walk,
166.495	you don't wiggle.
168.083	Those gravitational waves in the structure of space
170.831	are totally invisible for all practical purposes.
173.605	But early on, when the universe was making
176.509	that last afterglow,
178.879	the gravitational waves
180.437	put little twists in the structure
183.3	of the light that we see.
184.827	So by looking at the night sky deeper and deeper --
187.793	in fact, these guys spent
187.793	three years on the South Pole
190.431	looking straight up through the coldest, clearest,
193.02	cleanest air they possibly could find
195.37	looking deep into the night sky and studying
197.799	that glow and looking for the faint twists
201.175	which are the symbol, the signal,
203.523	of gravitational waves,
205.343	the ringing of the early universe.
207.684	And on Monday, they announced
209.471	that they had found it.
211.215	And the thing that's so spectacular about that to me
213.642	is not just the ringing, though that is awesome.
216.39	The thing that's totally amazing,
217.748	the reason I'm on this stage, is because
219.85	what that tells us is something
219.85	deep about the early universe.
223.318	It tells us that we
224.982	and everything we see around us
226.418	are basically one large bubble --
229.372	and this is the idea of inflationâ€”
231.128	one large bubble surrounded by something else.
235.02	This isn't conclusive evidence for inflation,
237.15	but anything that isn't inflation that explains this
239.324	will look the same.
240.641	This is a theory, an idea,
242.286	that has been around for a while,
243.51	and we never thought we we'd really see it.
245.235	For good reasons, we thought we'd never see
247.073	killer evidence, and this is killer evidence.
249.321	But the really crazy idea
251.331	is that our bubble is just one bubble
254.363	in a much larger, roiling pot of universal stuff.
258.989	We're never going to see the stuff outside,
260.815	but by going to the South Pole
260.815	and spending three years
263.389	looking at the detailed structure of the night sky,
265.949	we can figure out
267.805	that we're probably in a universe
267.805	that looks kind of like that.
270.895	And that amazes me.
273.317	Thanks a lot.
