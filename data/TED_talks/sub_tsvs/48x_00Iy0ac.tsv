12.42	Imagine that when you walked
12.42	in here this evening,
15.26	you discovered that everybody in the room
15.26	looked almost exactly the same:
20.1	ageless, raceless,
22.06	generically good-looking.
24.1	That person sitting right next to you
26.1	might have the most
26.1	idiosyncratic inner life,
28.26	but you don't have a clue
29.54	because we're all wearing
29.54	the same blank expression all the time.
34.78	That is the kind of creepy transformation
34.78	that is taking over cities,
39.74	only it applies to buildings, not people.
43.3	Cities are full of roughness and shadow,
49.3	texture and color.
50.54	You can still find architectural surfaces
50.54	of great individuality and character
57.18	in apartment buildings in Riga
59.9	and Yemen,
62.34	social housing in Vienna,
64.82	Hopi villages in Arizona,
67.22	brownstones in New York,
69.34	wooden houses in San Francisco.
71.62	These aren't palaces or cathedrals.
73.9	These are just ordinary residences
75.7	expressing the ordinary
75.7	splendor of cities.
79.3	And the reason they're like that
79.3	is that the need for shelter
82.62	is so bound up with
82.62	the human desire for beauty.
88.42	Their rough surfaces
88.42	give us a touchable city.
92.66	Right? Streets that you can read
94.26	by running your fingers
94.26	over brick and stone.
97.42	But that's getting harder to do,
100.02	because cities are becoming smooth.
103.5	New downtowns sprout towers
105.58	that are almost always
105.58	made of concrete and steel
107.94	and covered in glass.
110.74	You can look at skylines
110.74	all over the world --
113.62	Houston,
115.46	Guangzhou,
117.26	Frankfurt --
119.26	and you see the same army
119.26	of high-gloss robots
122.7	marching over the horizon.
125.38	Now, just think of everything we lose
127.54	when architects stop using
127.54	the full range of available materials.
132.62	When we reject granite
132.62	and limestone and sandstone
136.38	and wood and copper
136.38	and terra-cotta and brick
138.58	and wattle and plaster,
140.94	we simplify architecture
143.1	and we impoverish cities.
145.7	It's as if you reduced
145.7	all of the world's cuisines
149.42	down to airline food.
151.38	(Laughter)
152.46	Chicken or pasta?
155.26	But worse still,
157.58	assemblies of glass towers
157.58	like this one in Moscow
161.18	suggest a disdain for the civic
161.18	and communal aspects of urban living.
166.1	Right? Buildings like these are intended
166.1	to enrich their owners and tenants,
171.18	but not necessarily
171.18	the lives of the rest of us,
173.78	those of us who navigate
173.78	the spaces between the buildings.
178.26	And we expect to do so for free.
181.62	Shiny towers are an invasive species
184.9	and they are choking our cities
184.9	and killing off public space.
189.14	We tend to think of a facade
189.14	as being like makeup,
192.62	a decorative layer applied at the end
192.62	to a building that's effectively complete.
196.98	But just because a facade is superficial
199.54	doesn't mean it's not also deep.
201.82	Let me give you an example
204.02	of how a city's surfaces
204.02	affect the way we live in it.
207.06	When I visited Salamanca in Spain,
209.98	I gravitated to the Plaza Mayor
212.26	at all hours of the day.
213.7	Early in the morning,
213.7	sunlight rakes the facades,
216.7	sharpening shadows,
218.42	and at night, lamplight
218.42	segments the buildings
221.74	into hundreds of distinct areas,
224.34	balconies and windows and arcades,
226.74	each one a separate pocket
226.74	of visual activity.
230.5	That detail and depth, that glamour
234.46	gives the plaza a theatrical quality.
238.82	It becomes a stage
238.82	where the generations can meet.
241.98	You have teenagers
241.98	sprawling on the pavers,
245.38	seniors monopolizing the benches,
248.22	and real life starts to look
248.22	like an opera set.
252.14	The curtain goes up on Salamanca.
255.34	So just because I'm talking
255.34	about the exteriors of buildings,
260.34	not form, not function, not structure,
264.58	even so those surfaces
264.58	give texture to our lives,
269.219	because buildings
269.219	create the spaces around them,
272.14	and those spaces can draw people in
275.18	or push them away.
277.1	And the difference often has to do
277.1	with the quality of those exteriors.
280.82	So one contemporary equivalent
280.82	of the Plaza Mayor in Salamanca
284.58	is the Place de la Défense in Paris,
287.7	a windswept, glass-walled open space
291.34	that office workers hurry through
293.14	on the way from the metro
293.14	to their cubicles
295.66	but otherwise spend
295.66	as little time in as possible.
299.94	In the early 1980s,
299.94	the architect Philip Johnson
303.26	tried to recreate a gracious
303.26	European plaza in Pittsburgh.
307.5	This is PPG Place,
309.02	a half acre of open space
309.02	encircled by commercial buildings
314.26	made of mirrored glass.
315.74	And he ornamented those buildings
315.74	with metal trim and bays
319.18	and Gothic turrets
321.14	which really pop on the skyline.
323.7	But at ground level,
326.34	the plaza feels like a black glass cage.
329.9	I mean, sure, in summertime
331.78	kids are running back and forth
331.78	through the fountain
334.26	and there's ice-skating in the winter,
336.26	but it lacks the informality
336.26	of a leisurely hangout.
339.5	It's just not the sort of place
339.5	you really want to just hang out and chat.
347.3	Public spaces thrive or fail
347.3	for many different reasons.
351.06	Architecture is only one,
353.3	but it's an important one.
355.66	Some recent plazas
357.02	like Federation Square in Melbourne
360.46	or Superkilen in Copenhagen
363.78	succeed because they combine old and new,
367.18	rough and smooth,
369.22	neutral and bright colors,
371.1	and because they don't rely
371.1	excessively on glass.
375.82	Now, I'm not against glass.
379.62	It's an ancient and versatile material.
383.46	It's easy to manufacture and transport
387.7	and install and replace
389.78	and clean.
391.34	It comes in everything
391.34	from enormous, ultraclear sheets
394.26	to translucent bricks.
397.02	New coatings make it change mood
399.34	in the shifting light.
401.7	In expensive cities like New York,
401.7	it has the magical power
404.98	of being able to multiply
404.98	real estate values by allowing views,
408.62	which is really the only commodity
408.62	that developers have to offer
411.74	to justify those surreal prices.
416.22	In the middle of the 19th century,
418.18	with the construction
418.18	of the Crystal Palace in London,
420.98	glass leapt to the top of the list
420.98	of quintessentially modern substances.
426.1	By the mid-20th century,
427.62	it had come to dominate
427.62	the downtowns of some American cities,
431.5	largely through some
431.5	really spectacular office buildings
434.54	like Lever House in midtown Manhattan,
434.54	designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.
439.38	Eventually, the technology
439.38	advanced to the point
442.1	where architects could design
442.1	structures so transparent
445.22	they practically disappear.
448.18	And along the way,
449.62	glass became the default material
449.62	of the high-rise city,
454.5	and there's a very
454.5	powerful reason for that.
457.02	Because as the world's populations
457.02	converge on cities,
461.82	the least fortunate pack
461.82	into jerry-built shantytowns.
465.5	But hundreds of millions of people
465.5	need apartments and places to work
469.34	in ever-larger buildings,
470.58	so it makes economic sense
470.58	to put up towers
473.22	and wrap them in cheap
473.22	and practical curtain walls.
477.42	But glass has a limited ability
480.9	to be expressive.
483.06	This is a section of wall framing a plaza
485.26	in the pre-Hispanic city of Mitla,
485.26	in southern Mexico.
490.46	Those 2,000-year-old carvings
491.98	make it clear that this was a place
491.98	of high ritual significance.
497.06	Today we look at those and we can see
497.06	a historical and textural continuity
502.86	between those carvings,
502.86	the mountains all around
505.74	and that church which is built
505.74	on top of the ruins
509.62	using stone plundered from the site.
512.7	In nearby Oaxaca,
512.7	even ordinary plaster buildings
515.62	become canvasses for
515.62	bright colors, political murals
519.98	and sophisticated graphic arts.
522.82	It's an intricate, communicative language
526.22	that an epidemic of glass
526.22	would simply wipe out.
529.78	The good news is
529.78	that architects and developers
532.58	have begun to rediscover
532.58	the joys of texture
535.58	without backing away from modernity.
538.06	Some find innovative uses
538.06	for old materials like brick
543.14	and terra-cotta.
545.58	Others invent new products
545.58	like the molded panels that Snøhetta used
550.9	to give the San Francisco
550.9	Museum of Modern Art
553.34	that crinkly, sculptural quality.
556.34	The architect Stefano Boeri
556.34	even created living facades.
560.26	This is his Vertical Forest,
560.26	a pair of apartment towers in Milan,
564.3	whose most visible feature is greenery.
567.06	And Boeri is designing a version of this
567.06	for Nanjing in China.
572.9	And imagine if green facades
572.9	were as ubiquitous as glass ones
577.06	how much cleaner the air
577.06	in Chinese cities would become.
581.1	But the truth is
581.1	that these are mostly one-offs,
584.14	boutique projects,
585.66	not easily reproduced at a global scale.
589.54	And that is the point.
592.18	When you use materials
592.18	that have a local significance,
595.3	you prevent cities
595.3	from all looking the same.
598.58	Copper has a long history in New York --
601.46	the Statue of Liberty,
603.54	the crown of the Woolworth Building --
606.02	but it fell out of fashion for a long time
609.22	until SHoP Architects used it
609.22	to cover the American Copper Building,
613.62	a pair of twisting towers
613.62	on the East River.
616.98	It's not even finished
618.26	and you can see the way
618.26	sunset lights up that metallic facade,
622.38	which will weather to green as it ages.
625.54	Buildings can be like people.
627.86	Their faces broadcast their experience.
631.22	And that's an important point,
632.7	because when glass ages,
635.62	you just replace it,
637.14	and the building looks
637.14	pretty much the same way it did before
640.06	until eventually it's demolished.
641.78	Almost all other materials
641.78	have the ability
644.58	to absorb infusions of history and memory,
648.18	and project it into the present.
652.66	The firm Ennead
654.54	clad the Utah Natural History Museum
654.54	in Salt Lake City in copper and zinc,
659.46	ores that have been mined
659.46	in the area for 150 years
665.1	and that also camouflage the building
665.1	against the ochre hills
669.18	so that you have a natural history museum
671.5	that reflects the region's
671.5	natural history.
675.5	And when the Chinese
675.5	Pritzker Prize winner Wang Shu
678.3	was building a history museum in Ningbo,
681.66	he didn't just create
681.66	a wrapper for the past,
684.9	he built memory right into the walls
687.98	by using brick and stones and shingles
691.7	salvaged from villages
691.7	that had been demolished.
696.26	Now, architects can use glass
699.14	in equally lyrical and inventive ways.
701.94	Here in New York, two buildings,
703.66	one by Jean Nouvel
703.66	and this one by Frank Gehry
706.98	face off across West 19th Street,
709.62	and the play of reflections
709.62	that they toss back and forth
712.58	is like a symphony in light.
716.1	But when a city defaults to glass
719.14	as it grows,
720.66	it becomes a hall of mirrors,
722.9	disquieting and cold.
725.82	After all, cities are places
725.82	of concentrated variety
731.5	where the world's cultures
731.5	and languages and lifestyles
736.54	come together and mingle.
738.82	So rather than encase all that variety
742.62	and diversity in buildings
742.62	of crushing sameness,
746.62	we should have an architecture that honors
746.62	the full range of the urban experience.
751.82	Thank you.
753.06	(Applause)
