12.854	The first time I uttered a prayer
12.854	was in a glass-stained cathedral.
18.403	I was kneeling long after
18.403	the congregation was on its feet,
21.793	dip both hands into holy water,
23.703	trace the trinity across my chest,
25.553	my tiny body drooping 
25.553	like a question mark
28.379	all over the wooden pew.
30.669	I asked Jesus to fix me,
33.339	and when he did not answer
35.465	I befriended silence in the hopes
35.465	that my sin would burn
38.141	and salve my mouth
39.631	would dissolve like sugar on tongue,
41.461	but shame lingered as an aftertaste.
43.376	And in an attempt
43.376	to reintroduce me to sanctity,
46.94	my mother told me of the miracle I was,
49.86	said I could grow up 
49.86	to be anything I want.
52.86	I decided to
55.066	be a boy.
56.227	It was cute.
57.217	I had snapback, toothless grin,
59.007	used skinned knees as street cred,
60.847	played hide and seek with 
60.847	what was left of my goal.
63.277	I was it.
64.204	The winner to a game 
64.204	the other kids couldn't play,
66.629	I was the mystery of an anatomy,
68.809	a question asked but not answered,
70.622	tightroping between awkward boy
70.622	and apologetic girl,
74.918	and when I turned 12, the boy phase
74.918	wasn't deemed cute anymore.
79.655	It was met with nostalgic aunts who missed
79.655	seeing my knees in the shadow of skirts,
85.297	who reminded me that my kind of attitude
85.297	would never bring a husband home,
89.546	that I exist for heterosexual marriage
89.546	and child-bearing.
93.168	And I swallowed their insults
93.168	along with their slurs.
96.999	Naturally, I did not
96.999	come out of the closet.
99.716	The kids at my school opened it
99.716	without my permission.
102.432	Called me by a name I did not recognize,
104.894	"said ""lesbian,"""
106.124	but I was more boy than girl,
106.124	more Ken than Barbie.
108.7	It had nothing to do with hating my body,
110.903	I just love it enough to let it go,
113.023	I treat it like a house,
114.409	and when your house is falling apart,
116.239	you do not evacuate,
117.223	you make it comfortable enough
117.223	to house all your insides,
121.015	you make it pretty enough
121.015	to invite guests over,
123.376	you make the floorboards
123.376	strong enough to stand on.
127.904	My mother fears I have named
127.904	myself after fading things.
132.919	As she counts the echoes
132.919	left behind by Mya Hall,
135.939	Leelah Alcorn, Blake Brockington.
138.489	She fears that I'll die without a whisper,
140.7	"that I'll turn into ""what a shame"""
140.7	conversations at the bus stop.
143.763	She claims I have turned myself
143.763	into a mausoleum,
146.409	that I am a walking casket,
148.035	news headlines have turned
148.035	my identity into a spectacle,
151.239	Bruce Jenner on everyone's lips
151.239	while the brutality of living in this body
154.995	becomes an asterisk 
154.995	at the bottom of equality pages.
158.541	No one ever thinks of us as human
161.637	because we are more ghost than flesh,
163.795	because people fear that
163.795	my gender expression is a trick,
166.494	that it exists to be perverse,
168.351	that it ensnares them
168.351	without their consent,
170.394	that my body is a feast
170.394	for their eyes and hands
173.088	and once they have fed off my queer,
175.387	they'll regurgitate all the parts
175.387	they did not like.
178.387	They'll put me back into the closet,
178.387	hang me with all the other skeletons.
182.747	I will be the best attraction.
185.162	Can you see how easy it is
185.162	to talk people into coffins,
188.241	to misspell their names on gravestones.
190.811	And people still wonder why
190.811	there are boys rotting,
193.266	they go away
193.266	in high school hallways
195.657	they are afraid of becoming another
195.657	hashtag in a second
198.559	afraid of classroom discussions
198.559	becoming like judgment day
202.437	and now oncoming traffic is embracing
202.437	more transgender children than parents.
209.062	I wonder how long it will be
210.807	before the trans suicide notes
210.807	start to feel redundant,
214.487	before we realize that our bodies
214.487	become lessons about sin
218.11	way before we learn how to love them.
220.153	Like God didn't save
220.153	all this breath and mercy,
224.077	like my blood is not the wine
224.077	that washed over Jesus' feet.
227.653	My prayers are now
227.653	getting stuck in my throat.
232.041	Maybe I am finally fixed,
235.175	maybe I just don't care,
237.428	maybe God finally listened to my prayers.
242.139	Thank you.
243.604	(Applause)
