13.391	You probably don't know me,
15.67	but I am one of those .01 percenters
19.014	that you hear about and read about,
20.957	and I am by any reasonable definition a plutocrat.
25.022	And tonight, what I would like to do is speak directly
28.112	to other plutocrats, to my people,
30.418	because it feels like it's time for us all
33.229	to have a chat.
35.305	Like most plutocrats, I too am a proud
37.883	and unapologetic capitalist.
40.226	I have founded, cofounded or funded
43.763	over 30 companies across a range of industries.
47.293	I was the first non-family investor in Amazon.com.
50.888	I cofounded a company called aQuantive
53.609	that we sold to Microsoft for 6.4 billion dollars.
57.479	My friends and I, we own a bank.
60.027	I tell you this — (Laughter) —
62.923	unbelievable, right?
64.17	I tell you this to show
67.38	that my life is like most plutocrats.
70.143	I have a broad perspective on capitalism
73.45	and business,
75.25	and I have been rewarded obscenely for that
79.04	with a life that most of you all
81.197	can't even imagine:
83.456	multiple homes, a yacht, my own plane,
86.157	etc., etc., etc.
90.284	But let's be honest: I am not the
90.284	smartest person you've ever met.
93.546	I am certainly not the hardest working.
95.95	I was a mediocre student.
97.923	I'm not technical at all.
99.141	I can't write a word of code.
101.639	Truly, my success is the consequence
104.772	of spectacular luck,
107.22	of birth, of circumstance and of timing.
112.124	But I am actually pretty good at a couple of things.
116.619	One, I have an unusually high tolerance for risk,
121.263	and the other is I have a good sense,
123.678	a good intuition about what will happen in the future,
126.303	and I think that that intuition about the future
129.586	is the essence of good entrepreneurship.
133.156	So what do I see in our future today,
135.674	you ask?
137.676	I see pitchforks,
139.331	as in angry mobs with pitchforks,
144.121	because while people like us plutocrats
149.335	are living beyond the dreams of avarice,
152.866	the other 99 percent of our fellow citizens
155.779	are falling farther and farther behind.
158.592	In 1980, the top one percent of Americans
161.08	shared about eight percent of national [income],
163.558	while the bottom 50 percent of Americans
166.232	shared 18 percent.
168.775	Thirty years later, today, the top one percent
172.127	shares over 20 percent of national [income],
175.749	while the bottom 50 percent of Americans
177.65	share 12 or 13.
180.564	If the trend continues,
183.01	the top one percent will share
184.49	over 30 percent of national [income]
186.796	in another 30 years,
188.588	while the bottom 50 percent of Americans
190.868	will share just six.
192.607	You see, the problem isn't that we have
194.603	some inequality.
196.684	Some inequality is necessary
199.136	for a high-functioning capitalist democracy.
202.43	The problem is that inequality
204.14	is at historic highs today
207.502	and it's getting worse every day.
210.921	And if wealth, power, and income
213.545	continue to concentrate
215.38	at the very tippy top,
217.681	our society will change
219.529	from a capitalist democracy
221.262	to a neo-feudalist rentier society
225.034	like 18th-century France.
227.019	That was France
230.213	before the revolution
231.96	and the mobs with the pitchforks.
233.984	So I have a message for my fellow plutocrats
236.538	and zillionaires
238.36	and for anyone who lives
239.834	in a gated bubble world:
242.07	Wake up.
243.421	Wake up. It cannot last.
247.141	Because if we do not do something
249.16	to fix the glaring economic inequities in our society,
253.491	the pitchforks will come for us,
256.236	for no free and open society can long sustain
260.184	this kind of rising economic inequality.
263.188	It has never happened. There are no examples.
266.11	You show me a highly unequal society,
267.969	and I will show you a police state
269.448	or an uprising.
271.215	The pitchforks will come for us
273.358	if we do not address this.
275.269	It's not a matter of if, it's when.
279.117	And it will be terrible when they come
282.75	for everyone,
284.201	but particularly for people like us plutocrats.
289.185	I know I must sound like some liberal do-gooder.
292.605	I'm not. I'm not making a moral argument
294.855	that economic inequality is wrong.
298.117	What I am arguing is that rising economic inequality
302.403	is stupid and ultimately self-defeating.
305.924	Rising inequality doesn't just increase our risks
309.152	from pitchforks,
311.02	but it's also terrible for business too.
315.587	So the model for us rich guys should be Henry Ford.
319.457	When Ford famously introduced the $5 day,
323.27	which was twice the prevailing wage at the time,
326.217	he didn't just increase the productivity
328.287	of his factories,
330.256	he converted exploited autoworkers who were poor
333.653	into a thriving middle class who could now afford
336.353	to buy the products that they made.
339.57	Ford intuited what we now know is true,
343.86	that an economy is best understood as an ecosystem
347.861	and characterized by the same kinds
349.78	of feedback loops you find
352.34	in a natural ecosystem,
354.08	a feedback loop between customers and businesses.
358.018	Raising wages increases demand,
361.124	which increases hiring,
363.205	which in turn increases wages
365.286	and demand and profits,
367.916	and that virtuous cycle of increasing prosperity
372.76	is precisely what is missing
374.909	from today's economic recovery.
379.904	And this is why we need to put behind us
384.522	the trickle-down policies that so dominate
388.23	both political parties
390.027	and embrace something I call middle-out economics.
393.432	Middle-out economics rejects
395.967	the neoclassical economic idea
398.284	that economies are efficient, linear, mechanistic,
402.481	that they tend towards equilibrium and fairness,
405.608	and instead embraces the 21st-century idea
409.046	that economies are complex, adaptive,
412.82	ecosystemic,
414.822	that they tend away from
414.822	equilibrium and toward inequality,
418.17	that they're not efficient at all
419.92	but are effective if well managed.
423.205	This 21st-century perspective
426.476	allows you to clearly see that capitalism
429.14	does not work by [efficiently] allocating
432.427	existing resources.
434.867	It works by [efficiently] creating new solutions
440.865	to human problems.
442.12	The genius of capitalism
444.329	is that it is an evolutionary solution-finding system.
449.211	It rewards people for solving
449.211	other people's problems.
455.162	The difference between a poor society
458.109	and a rich society, obviously,
460.426	is the degree to which that society
463.364	has generated solutions in the form
465.297	of products for its citizens.
468.156	The sum of the solutions
469.977	that we have in our society
471.968	really is our prosperity, and this explains
474.342	why companies like Google and Amazon
476.625	and Microsoft and Apple
478.988	and the entrepreneurs who created those companies
481.89	have contributed so much
485.45	to our nation's prosperity.
488.156	This 21st-century perspective
490.956	also makes clear
493.545	that what we think of as economic growth
495.99	is best understood as
497.937	the rate at which we solve problems.
500.431	But that rate is totally dependent upon
503.849	how many problem solvers —
507.426	diverse, able problem solvers — we have,
509.912	and thus how many of our fellow citizens
512.645	actively participate,
514.87	both as entrepreneurs who can offer solutions,
518.52	and as customers who consume them.
522.162	But this maximizing participation thing
526.28	doesn't happen by accident.
527.899	It doesn't happen by itself.
529.868	It requires effort and investment,
533.597	which is why all
536.027	highly prosperous capitalist democracies
539.258	are characterized by massive investments
541.807	in the middle class and the infrastructure
544.372	that they depend on.
547.24	We plutocrats need to get this
549.239	trickle-down economics thing behind us,
552.378	this idea that the better we do,
554.284	the better everyone else will do.
556.951	It's not true. How could it be?
560.871	I earn 1,000 times the median wage,
564.999	but I do not buy 1,000 times as much stuff,
567.924	do I?
568.988	I actually bought two pairs of these pants,
572.176	what my partner Mike calls
574.11	my manager pants.
575.625	I could have bought 2,000 pairs,
578.561	but what would I do with them? (Laughter)
581.627	How many haircuts can I get?
584.656	How often can I go out to dinner?
588.361	No matter how wealthy a few plutocrats get,
592.434	we can never drive a great national economy.
595.978	Only a thriving middle class can do that.
601.671	There's nothing to be done,
603.368	my plutocrat friends might say.
607.509	Henry Ford was in a different time.
610.713	Maybe we can't do some things.
612.987	Maybe we can do some things.
615.923	June 19, 2013,
619.784	Bloomberg published an article I wrote called
623.217	"""The Capitalist’s Case for a $15 Minimum Wage."""
628.15	The good people at Forbes magazine,
631.072	among my biggest admirers,
633.27	"called it ""Nick Hanauer's near-insane proposal."""
637.99	And yet, just 350 days
641.219	after that article was published,
643.795	Seattle's Mayor Ed Murray signed into law
646.744	an ordinance raising the minimum wage in Seattle
650.51	to 15 dollars an hour,
652.198	more than double
653.638	what the prevailing federal $7.25 rate is.
658.33	How did this happen,
660.11	reasonable people might ask.
662.195	It happened because a group of us
663.863	reminded the middle class
665.227	that they are the source
666.878	of growth and prosperity in capitalist economies.
670.544	We reminded them that when
670.544	workers have more money,
674.11	businesses have more customers,
675.822	and need more employees.
677.804	We reminded them that when businesses
680.49	pay workers a living wage,
683.21	taxpayers are relieved of the burden
685.102	of funding the poverty programs
686.812	like food stamps and medical assistance
689.714	and rent assistance
691.424	that those workers need.
693.82	We reminded them that low-wage workers
696.784	make terrible taxpayers,
699.11	and that when you raise the minimum wage
701.128	for all businesses,
703.253	all businesses benefit
704.92	yet all can compete.
707.651	Now the orthodox reaction, of course,
709.372	is raising the minimum wage costs jobs. Right?
713.175	Your politician's always echoing
715.763	that trickle-down idea by saying things like,
718.855	"""Well, if you raise the price of employment,"
720.948	"guess what happens? You get less of it."""
723.74	Are you sure?
726.17	Because there's some contravening evidence.
729.823	Since 1980, the wages of CEOs in our country
734.582	have gone from about 30 times the median wage
736.85	to 500 times.
739.122	That's raising the price of employment.
742.29	And yet, to my knowledge,
745.262	I have never seen a company
747.434	outsource its CEO's job, automate their job,
751.18	export the job to China.
753.267	In fact, we appear to be employing
755.293	more CEOs and senior managers than ever before.
758.515	So too for technology workers
762.705	and financial services workers,
764.531	who earn multiples of the median wage
767.149	and yet we employ more and more of them,
769.154	so clearly you can raise the price of employment
774.05	and get more of it.
776.091	I know that most people
778.675	think that the $15 minimum wage
780.397	is this insane, risky economic experiment.
784.312	We disagree.
786.21	We believe that the $15 minimum wage
788.684	in Seattle
789.95	is actually the continuation
791.803	of a logical economic policy.
794.511	It is allowing our city
796.471	to kick your city's ass.
799.206	Because, you see,
800.965	Washington state already has
802.677	the highest minimum wage
804.17	of any state in the nation.
805.869	We pay all workers $9.32,
808.13	which is almost 30 percent more
809.973	than the federal minimum of 7.25,
812.531	but crucially, 427 percent more
816.484	than the federal tipped minimum of 2.13.
820.07	If trickle-down thinkers were right,
822.686	then Washington state should
822.686	have massive unemployment.
825.798	Seattle should be sliding into the ocean.
828.478	And yet, Seattle
831.501	is the fastest-growing big city in the country.
835.399	Washington state is generating small business jobs
839.516	at a higher rate than any other major state
842.137	in the nation.
843.993	The restaurant business in Seattle? Booming.
847.897	Why? Because the fundamental law of capitalism is,
852.285	when workers have more money,
853.9	businesses have more customers
855.426	and need more workers.
857.683	When restaurants pay restaurant workers enough
860.834	so that even they can afford to eat in restaurants,
864.456	that's not bad for the restaurant business.
867.121	That's good for it,
868.82	despite what some restaurateurs may tell you.
873.399	Is it more complicated than I'm making out?
875.457	Of course it is.
876.454	There are a lot of dynamics at play.
878.322	But can we please stop insisting
880.564	that if low-wage workers earn a little bit more,
883.365	unemployment will skyrocket
884.873	and the economy will collapse?
886.201	There is no evidence for it.
888.81	The most insidious thing
890.041	about trickle-down economics
891.888	is not the claim that if the rich get richer,
894.19	everyone is better off.
895.727	It is the claim made by those who oppose
898.788	any increase in the minimum wage
900.69	that if the poor get richer,
902.545	that will be bad for the economy.
904.762	This is nonsense.
906.742	So can we please dispense with this rhetoric
910.607	that says that rich guys like me
912.95	and my plutocrat friends
915.804	made our country?
918.377	We plutocrats know,
920.452	even if we don't like to admit it in public,
922.076	that if we had been born somewhere else,
924.745	not here in the United States,
926.642	we might very well be just some dude standing barefoot
929.502	by the side of a dirt road selling fruit.
932.652	It's not that they don't have good
932.652	entrepreneurs in other places,
935.183	even very, very poor places.
937.208	It's just that that's all
938.76	that those entrepreneurs' customers can afford.
943.296	So here's an idea for a new kind of economics,
947.895	a new kind of politics
949.442	that I call new capitalism.
952.329	Let's acknowledge that capitalism
954.801	beats the alternatives,
956.598	but also that the more people we include,
960.595	both as entrepreneurs and as customers,
964.119	the better it works.
966.279	Let's by all means shrink the size of government,
970.065	but not by slashing the poverty programs,
972.784	but by ensuring that workers are paid enough
974.801	so that they actually don't need those programs.
978.123	Let's invest enough in the middle class
981.04	to make our economy fairer and more inclusive,
984.233	and by fairer, more truly competitive,
988.167	and by more truly competitive,
989.929	more able to generate the solutions
992.745	to human problems
994.217	that are the true drivers of growth and prosperity.
999.847	Capitalism is the greatest social technology
1003.12	ever invented
1004.589	for creating prosperity in human societies,
1007.451	if it is well managed,
1009.185	but capitalism, because of the fundamental
1012.356	multiplicative dynamics of complex systems,
1015.121	tends towards, inexorably, inequality,
1018.649	concentration and collapse.
1023.07	The work of democracies
1025.518	is to maximize the inclusion of the many
1030.021	in order to create prosperity,
1032.998	not to enable the few to accumulate money.
1036.92	Government does create prosperity and growth,
1040.02	by creating the conditions that allow
1043.246	both entrepreneurs and their customers
1046.137	to thrive.
1047.982	Balancing the power of capitalists like me
1051.166	and workers isn't bad for capitalism.
1054.338	It's essential to it.
1056.138	Programs like a reasonable minimum wage,
1058.804	affordable healthcare,
1060.818	paid sick leave,
1062.121	and the progressive taxation necessary
1065.54	to pay for the important infrastructure
1067.736	necessary for the middle class like education, R and D,
1071.787	these are indispensable tools
1074.353	shrewd capitalists should embrace
1076.462	to drive growth, because no one benefits from it
1080.448	like us.
1082.094	Many economists would have you believe
1084.342	that their field is an objective science.
1087.422	I disagree, and I think that it is equally
1090.269	a tool that humans use
1092.338	to enforce and encode
1094.227	our social and moral preferences and prejudices
1097.803	about status and power,
1101.705	which is why plutocrats like me
1103.982	have always needed to find persuasive stories
1107.988	to tell everyone else
1109.662	about why our relative positions
1113.776	are morally righteous and good for everyone:
1117.908	like, we are indispensable, the job creators,
1122.183	and you are not;
1124.545	like, tax cuts for us create growth,
1127.931	but investments in you
1129.945	will balloon our debt
1131.621	and bankrupt our great country;
1134.129	that we matter;
1135.997	that you don't.
1138.348	For thousands of years, these stories were called
1140.991	divine right.
1142.439	Today, we have trickle-down economics.
1146.693	How obviously, transparently self-serving
1150.576	all of this is.
1152.17	We plutocrats need to see
1154.952	that the United States of America made us,
1157.305	not the other way around;
1158.989	that a thriving middle class is the source
1161.827	of prosperity in capitalist economies,
1164.123	not a consequence of it.
1166.762	And we should never forget
1169.453	that even the best of us in
1169.453	the worst of circumstances
1173.148	are barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit.
1178.882	Fellow plutocrats, I think it may be time for us
1181.496	to recommit to our country,
1183.699	to commit to a new kind of capitalism
1186.261	which is both more inclusive and more effective,
1190.615	a capitalism that will ensure
1192.673	that America's economy remains
1195.834	the most dynamic and prosperous in the world.
1199.22	Let's secure the future for ourselves,
1201.38	our children and their children.
1204.114	Or alternatively, we could do nothing,
1207.162	hide in our gated communities
1209.243	and private schools,
1212.1	enjoy our planes and yachts
1214.136	— they're fun —
1216.476	and wait for the pitchforks.
1218.287	Thank you.
1219.81	(Applause)
