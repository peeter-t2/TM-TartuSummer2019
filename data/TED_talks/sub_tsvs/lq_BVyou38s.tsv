12.577	Joe Kowan: I have stage fright.
14.074	I've always had stage fright,
15.567	and not just a little bit,
17.395	it's a big bit.
19.186	And it didn't even matter until I was 27.
21.979	That's when I started writing songs, and even then
24.537	I only played them for myself.
26.339	Just knowing my roommates were in the 
26.339	same house made me uncomfortable.
30.084	But after a couple of years, 
30.084	just writing songs wasn't enough.
32.891	I had all these stories and ideas,
32.891	and I wanted to share them with people,
35.91	but physiologically, I couldn't do it.
39.216	I had this irrational fear.
42.142	But the more I wrote, and the more I practiced,
44.301	the more I wanted to perform.
45.491	So on the week of my 30th birthday,
47.548	I decided I was going to go to this local open mic,
50.501	and put this fear behind me.
52.216	Well, when I got there, it was packed.
55.073	There were like 20 people there.
57.047	(Laughter)
58.93	And they all looked angry.
61.537	But I took a deep breath, and I signed up to play,
65.138	and I felt pretty good.
66.63	Pretty good, until about 10 minutes before my turn,
69.691	when my whole body rebelled, and 
69.691	this wave of anxiety just washed over me.
75.155	Now, when you experience fear, 
75.155	your sympathetic nervous system kicks in.
78.71	So you have a rush of adrenaline, 
78.71	your heart rate increases,
81.553	your breathing gets faster.
83.006	Next your non-essential systems start 
83.006	to shut down, like digestion. (Laughter)
89.178	So your mouth gets dry, and blood is routed
89.178	away from your extremities,
92.542	so your fingers don't work anymore.
95.142	Your pupils dilate, your muscles contract,
95.142	your Spidey sense tingles,
98.274	basically your whole body is trigger-happy.
98.274	(Laughter)
103.448	That condition is not conducive 
103.448	to performing folk music.
108.231	(Laughter)
109.8	I mean, your nervous system is an idiot.
112.432	Really? Two hundred thousand years of human evolution, and it still can't tell the difference
116.242	between a saber tooth tiger and 20 folksingers
118.614	on a Tuesday night open mic?
120.685	(Laughter)
122.116	I have never been more terrified -- until now.
126.173	(Laughter and cheers)
135.248	So then it was my turn,
137.757	and somehow, I get myself onto 
137.757	the stage, I start my song,
140.843	I open my mouth to sing the first line,
143.48	and this completely horrible vibrato --
145.443	you know, when your voice wavers -- 
145.443	comes streaming out.
147.93	And this is not the good kind of vibrato, 
147.93	like an opera singer has,
150.543	this is my whole body just convulsing with fear.
153.237	I mean, it's a nightmare.
154.888	I'm embarrassed, the audience 
154.888	is clearly uncomfortable,
157.356	they're focused on my discomfort.
159.709	It was so bad.
163.484	But that was my first real experience 
163.484	as a solo singer-songwriter.
167.421	And something good did happen --
167.421	I had the tiniest little glimpse
170.436	of that audience connection that I was hoping for.
172.919	And I wanted more. But I knew 
172.919	I had to get past this nervousness.
176.927	That night I promised myself: 
176.927	I would go back every week
180.097	until I wasn't nervous anymore.
182.032	And I did. I went back every single week,
184.915	and sure enough, week after week,
188.73	it didn't get any better. The same 
188.73	thing happened every week. (Laughter)
192.9	I couldn't shake it.
194.848	And that's when I had an epiphany.
196.521	And I remember it really well, because I 
196.521	don't have a lot of epiphanies. (Laughter)
202.532	All I had to do was write a song 
202.532	that exploits my nervousness.
206.161	That only seems authentic when I have stage fright,
208.283	and the more nervous I was,
209.571	the better the song would be. Easy.
212.16	So I started writing a song about having stage fright.
216.989	First, fessing up to the problem,
219.05	the physical manifestations, how I would feel,
220.878	how the listener might feel.
222.307	And then accounting for things like my shaky voice,
224.915	and I knew I would be singing about a 
224.915	half-octave higher than normal,
227.847	because I was nervous.
229.961	By having a song that explained 
229.961	what was happening to me,
233.033	while it was happening,
234.52	that gave the audience permission to think about it.
236.383	They didn't have to feel bad 
236.383	for me because I was nervous,
239.144	they could experience that with me,
240.862	and we were all one big happy, nervous, 
240.862	uncomfortable family. (Laughter)
246.111	By thinking about my audience, 
246.111	by embracing and exploiting my problem,
250.92	I was able to take something 
250.92	that was blocking my progress,
253.855	and turn it into something that 
253.855	was essential for my success.
257.792	And having the stage fright song let 
257.792	me get past that biggest issue
260.812	right in the beginning of a performance.
262.63	And then I could move on, 
262.63	and play the rest of my songs
264.174	with just a little bit more ease.
267.428	And eventually, over time, I didn't 
267.428	have to play the stage fright song at all.
273.704	Except for when I was really 
273.704	nervous, like now. (Laughter)
280.945	Would it be okay if I played the 
280.945	stage fright song for you?
283.67	(Applause)
292.753	Can I have a sip of water?
295.715	(Music)
300.143	Thank you.
307.442	♫ I'm not joking, you know, ♫
310.363	♫ this stage fright is real. ♫
315.991	♫ And if I'm up here trembling and singing, ♫
319.202	♫ well, you'll know how I feel. ♫
323.548	♫ And the mistake I'd be making, ♫
327.468	♫ the tremolo caused by my whole body shaking. ♫
331.396	♫ As you sit there feeling embarrassed for me, ♫
334.863	♫ well, you don't have to be. ♫
337.909	♫ Well, maybe just a little bit. ♫
340.424	(Laughter)
341.825	♫ And maybe I'll try to imagine 
341.825	you all without clothes. ♫
349.704	♫ But singing in front of all naked strangers
349.704	scares me more than anyone knows. ♫
357.577	♫ Not to discuss this at length, ♫
361.53	♫ but my body image was never my strength. ♫
366.775	♫ So frankly, I wish that you all would get dressed, ♫
370.313	♫ I mean, you're not even really naked. ♫
375.203	♫ And I'm the one with the problem. ♫
378.546	♫ And you tell me, don't worry 
378.546	so much, you'll be great. ♫
385.814	♫ But I'm the one living with me ♫
388.618	♫ and I know how I get. ♫
390.936	♫ Your advice is gentle but late. ♫
395.08	♫ If not just a bit patronizing. ♫
398.529	♫ And that sarcastic tone doesn't 
398.529	help me when I sing. ♫
403.361	♫ But we shouldn't talk about 
403.361	these things right now, ♫
407.249	♫ really, I'm up on stage, and 
407.249	you're in the crowd. Hi. ♫
414.136	♫ And I'm not making fun of 
414.136	unnurtured, irrational fear, ♫
423.359	♫ and if I wasn't ready to face this, ♫
426.275	♫ I sure as hell wouldn't be here. ♫
430.807	♫ But if I belt one note out clearly, ♫
435.945	♫ you'll know I'm recovering slowly but surely. ♫
440.231	♫ And maybe next week, I'll set my guitar ringin' ♫
444.194	♫ my voice clear as water, and everyone singin'. ♫
448.548	♫ But probably I'll just get up and start groovin', ♫
452.315	♫ my vocal cords movin', ♫
455.722	♫ at speeds slightly faster than sound. ♫
468.024	(Applause)
