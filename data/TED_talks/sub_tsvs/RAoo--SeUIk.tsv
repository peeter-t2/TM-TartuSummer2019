12.982	This is where I live. I live in Kenya,
15.756	at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park.
18.823	Those are my dad's cows at the back,
20.811	and behind the cows,
22.791	that's the Nairobi National Park.
25.095	Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely,
28.6	which means wild animals like zebras
32.062	migrate out of the park freely.
35.983	So predators like lions follow them,
39.996	and this is what they do.
42.791	They kill our livestock.
45.792	This is one of the cows which was killed at night,
48.239	and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead,
52.279	and I felt so bad,
54.705	because it was the only bull we had.
59.192	My community, the Maasai, we believe that
61.979	we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land
68.036	for herding them, and that's why we value them so much.
71.811	So I grew up hating lions so much.
75.57	The morans are the warriors
78.623	who protect our community and the livestock,
81.94	and they're also upset about this problem.
85.019	So they kill the lions.
88.024	It's one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi.
91.938	And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few.
96.477	So a boy, from six to nine years old, in my community
101.438	is responsible for his dad's cows,
104.312	and that's the same thing which happened to me.
107.442	So I had to find a way of solving this problem.
110.857	And the first idea I got was to use fire,
115.671	because I thought lions were scared of fire.
119.464	But I came to realize that that didn't really help,
124.183	because it was even helping the lions
126.792	to see through the cowshed.
130.303	So I didn't give up. I continued.
133.632	And a second idea I got was
136.272	to use a scarecrow.
138.339	I was trying to trick the lions
139.953	[into thinking] that I was standing near the cowshed.
142.86	But lions are very clever. (Laughter)
146.936	They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow, and they go back,
151.382	but the second day, they'll come and they say,
154.656	this thing is not moving here, it's always here. (Laughter)
157.766	So he jumps in and kills the animals.
161.003	So one night, I was walking around the cowshed with a torch,
164.956	and that day, the lions didn't come.
168.799	And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light.
173.357	So I had an idea.
175.93	Since I was a small boy,
178.24	I used to work in my room for the whole day,
181.498	and I even took apart my mom's new radio,
184.604	and that day she almost killed me,
186.422	but I learned a lot about electronics. (Laughter)
192.676	So I got an old car battery,
196.036	an indicator box. It's a small device found in a motorcycle,
199.826	and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left. It blinks.
204.877	And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights, on and off.
209.431	And that's a small torch from a broken flashlight.
214.259	So I set up everything.
217.14	As you can see, the solar panel charges the battery,
220.364	and the battery supplies the power
222.485	to the small indicator box. I call it a transformer.
225.54	And the indicator box makes the lights flash.
230.261	As you can see, the bulbs face outside,
234.012	because that's where the lions come from.
236.5	And that's how it looks to lions when they come at night.
240.564	The lights flash and trick
243.292	the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed,
245.234	but I was sleeping in my bed.
247.16	(Laughter)
249.9	(Applause)
251.569	Thanks.
257.164	So I set it up in my home two years ago,
261.44	and since then, we have never experienced any problem with lions.
264.76	And my neighboring homes heard about this idea.
268.772	One of them was this grandmother.
271.236	She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions,
275.512	and she asked me if I could put the lights for her.
277.646	"And I said, ""Yes."""
278.924	So I put the lights. You can see at the back, those are the lion lights.
283.524	Since now, I've set up seven homes around my community,
286.94	and they're really working.
289.165	And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya
294.345	for scaring other predators like hyenas, leopards,
299.458	and it's also being used
301.693	to scare elephants away from people's farms.
305.738	Because of this invention, I was lucky to get a scholarship
308.778	in one of the best schools in Kenya,
311.428	Brookhouse International School,
313.335	and I'm really excited about this.
316.262	My new school now is coming in and helping
320.112	by fundraising and creating an awareness.
324.644	I even took my friends back to my community,
329.927	and we're installing the lights to the homes
333.124	which don't have [any], and I'm teaching them how to put them.
337.773	So one year ago, I was just a boy in the savanna grassland
341.67	herding my father's cows,
343.344	and I used to see planes flying over,
346.298	and I told myself that one day, I'll be there inside.
350.509	And here I am today.
353.597	I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED.
359.533	So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up.
364.969	I used to hate lions, but now because my invention
368.663	is saving my father's cows and the lions,
371.981	we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict.
375.681	Ashê olên. It means in my language, thank you very much.
378.901	(Applause)
393.381	Chris Anderson: You have no idea how exciting it is
395.682	to hear a story like yours.
397.793	So you got this scholarship.Richard Turere: Yep.
399.829	CA: You're working on other electrical inventions.
402.406	What's the next one on your list?
404.264	RT: My next invention is,
406.938	I want to make an electric fence.CA: Electric fence?
409.52	RT: But I know electric fences are already invented,
411.681	but I want to make mine.
413.918	(Laughter)
416.009	CA: You already tried it once, right, and you --RT: I tried it before,
419.179	but I stopped because it gave me a shock. (Laughter)
425.936	CA: In the trenches. Richard Turere, you are something else.
429.262	We're going to cheer you on every step of the way, my friend.
432.23	Thank you so much.RT: Thank you. (Applause)
