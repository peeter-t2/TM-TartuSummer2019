12.112	In the early days of Twitter,
12.112	it was like a place of radical de-shaming.
17.463	People would admit
17.463	shameful secrets about themselves,
20.435	and other people would say,
20.435	"""Oh my God, I'm exactly the same."""
24.953	Voiceless people realized
24.953	that they had a voice,
27.779	and it was powerful and eloquent.
30.758	If a newspaper ran some racist
30.758	or homophobic column,
35.551	we realized we could do
35.551	something about it.
37.966	We could get them.
39.359	We could hit them with a weapon
39.359	that we understood but they didn't --
42.835	a social media shaming.
45.744	Advertisers would withdraw
45.744	their advertising.
48.933	When powerful people
48.933	misused their privilege,
51.967	we were going to get them.
54.312	This was like the
54.312	democratization of justice.
57.116	Hierarchies were being leveled out.
59.543	We were going to do things better.
62.755	Soon after that, a disgraced
62.755	pop science writer called Jonah Lehrer --
66.988	he'd been caught plagiarizing
66.988	and faking quotes,
70.147	and he was drenched in shame
70.147	and regret, he told me.
73.903	And he had the opportunity
75.418	to publicly apologize
75.418	at a foundation lunch.
79.272	This was going to be the most
79.272	important speech of his life.
82.227	Maybe it would win him some salvation.
85.114	He knew before he arrived
86.467	that the foundation was going to be
86.467	live-streaming his event,
89.57	but what he didn't know
89.57	until he turned up,
91.618	was that they'd erected a giant screen
91.618	Twitter feed right next to his head.
96.57	(Laughter)
98.086	Another one in a monitor screen
98.086	in his eye line.
100.653	I don't think the foundation did this
100.653	because they were monstrous.
104.113	I think they were clueless:
104.113	I think this was a unique moment
107.291	when the beautiful naivety of Twitter
109.852	was hitting the increasingly
109.852	horrific reality.
113.807	And here were some of the Tweets
113.807	that were cascading into his eye line,
117.184	as he was trying to apologize:
118.934	"""Jonah Lehrer, boring us"
118.934	"into forgiving him."""
122.22	(Laughter)
123.319	"And, ""Jonah Lehrer has not proven"
123.319	"that he is capable of feeling shame."""
128.589	That one must have been written
128.589	by the best psychiatrist ever,
132.304	to know that about such
132.304	a tiny figure behind a lectern.
136.135	"And, ""Jonah Lehrer is just"
136.135	"a frigging sociopath."""
139.874	That last word is a very human thing
139.874	to do, to dehumanize the people we hurt.
145.298	It's because we want to destroy people
145.298	but not feel bad about it.
150.503	Imagine if this was an actual court,
152.975	and the accused was in the dark,
152.975	begging for another chance,
155.825	and the jury was yelling out,
157.59	"""Bored! Sociopath!"""
160.301	(Laughter)
161.466	You know, when we watch
161.466	courtroom dramas, we tend to identify
164.509	with the kindhearted defense attorney,
167.504	but give us the power,
167.504	and we become like hanging judges.
171.846	Power shifts fast.
174.284	We were getting Jonah because he was
174.284	perceived to have misused his privilege,
178.804	but Jonah was on the floor then,
178.804	and we were still kicking,
182.111	and congratulating ourselves
182.111	for punching up.
185.734	And it began to feel weird and empty
185.734	when there wasn't a powerful person
189.957	who had misused their privilege
189.957	that we could get.
193.332	A day without a shaming
193.332	began to feel like a day
196.658	picking fingernails and treading water.
201.387	Let me tell you a story.
203.561	It's about a woman called Justine Sacco.
206.8	She was a PR woman from New York
206.8	with 170 Twitter followers,
210.768	and she'd Tweet little
210.768	acerbic jokes to them,
213.748	like this one on a plane
213.748	from New York to London:
217.395	[Weird German Dude: You're in first class.
217.395	"It's 2014. Get some deodorant."""
220.93	-Inner monologue as inhale BO.
220.93	Thank god for pharmaceuticals.]
224.056	So Justine chuckled to herself,
224.056	and pressed send, and got no replies,
227.343	and felt that sad feeling that we all feel
229.428	when the Internet doesn't
229.428	congratulate us for being funny.
233.086	(Laughter)
234.281	Black silence when the Internet
234.281	doesn't talk back.
238.039	And then she got to Heathrow,
238.039	and she had a little time to spare
241.206	before her final leg, so she thought up
241.206	another funny little acerbic joke:
246.006	[Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS.
246.006	Just kidding. I'm white!]
250.352	And she chuckled to herself, pressed send,
250.352	got on the plane, got no replies,
256.502	turned off her phone, fell asleep,
259.109	woke up 11 hours later,
261.122	turned on her phone while the plane
261.122	was taxiing on the runway,
264.74	and straightaway there was
264.74	a message from somebody
267.121	that she hadn't spoken
267.121	to since high school,
269.241	"that said, ""I am so sorry"
269.241	"to see what's happening to you."""
275.012	And then another message
275.012	from a best friend,
277.817	"""You need to call me right now."
279.855	You are the worldwide number one
279.855	"trending topic on Twitter."""
283.892	(Laughter)
286.254	What had happened is that one
286.254	of her 170 followers had sent the Tweet
289.728	to a Gawker journalist, and he
289.728	retweeted it to his 15,000 followers:
295.506	[And now, a funny holiday joke
295.506	from IAC's PR boss]
297.896	And then it was like a bolt of lightning.
299.883	A few weeks later, I talked
299.883	to the Gawker journalist.
302.409	I emailed him and asked him how it felt,
302.409	"and he said, ""It felt delicious."""
306.121	And then he said,
306.121	"""But I'm sure she's fine."""
309.65	But she wasn't fine,
309.65	because while she slept,
312.785	Twitter took control of her life
312.785	and dismantled it piece by piece.
319.147	First there were the philanthropists:
321.566	[If @JustineSacco's unfortunate
321.566	words ... bother you,
324.072	join me in supporting
324.072	@CARE's work in Africa.]
326.243	[In light of ... disgusting,
326.243	racist tweet, I'm donating to @care today]
330.056	Then came the beyond horrified:
331.571	[... no words for that horribly disgusting
331.571	racist as fuck tweet from Justine Sacco.
335.611	I am beyond horrified.]
336.786	Was anybody on Twitter
336.786	that night? A few of you.
339.063	Did Justine's joke overwhelm
339.063	your Twitter feed the way it did mine?
342.557	It did mine, and I thought
342.557	what everybody thought that night,
345.473	"which was, ""Wow, somebody's screwed!"
348.585	"Somebody's life is about to get terrible!"""
350.949	And I sat up in my bed,
352.281	and I put the pillow behind my head,
355.229	and then I thought, I'm not entirely sure
355.229	that joke was intended to be racist.
360.5	Maybe instead of gleefully
360.5	flaunting her privilege,
363.286	she was mocking the gleeful
363.286	flaunting of privilege.
365.91	There's a comedy tradition of this,
367.747	like South Park or Colbert
367.747	or Randy Newman.
371.459	Maybe Justine Sacco's crime was not being
371.459	as good at it as Randy Newman.
376.444	In fact, when I met Justine
376.444	a couple of weeks later in a bar,
379.388	she was just crushed,
381.501	and I asked her to explain the joke,
383.474	"and she said, ""Living in America"
383.474	puts us in a bit of a bubble
387.133	when it comes to what is going on
387.133	in the Third World.
389.651	"I was making of fun of that bubble."""
392.848	You know, another woman on Twitter that
392.848	night, a New Statesman writer Helen Lewis,
396.758	she reviewed my book on public shaming
396.758	and wrote that she Tweeted that night,
400.43	"""I'm not sure that her joke"
400.43	"was intended to be racist,"""
403.744	and she said straightaway she got
403.744	a fury of Tweets saying,
406.507	"""Well, you're just"
406.507	"a privileged bitch, too."""
408.984	And so to her shame, she wrote,
411.244	she shut up and watched
411.244	as Justine's life got torn apart.
417.697	It started to get darker:
419.53	[Everyone go report
419.53	this cunt @JustineSacco]
422.464	Then came the calls for her to be fired.
425.074	[Good luck with the job hunt
425.074	in the new year. #GettingFired]
427.97	Thousands of people around the world
429.729	decided it was their duty
429.729	to get her fired.
433.28	[@JustineSacco last tweet
433.28	of your career. #SorryNotSorry
437.162	Corporations got involved,
437.162	hoping to sell their products
440.361	on the back of Justine's annihilation:
442.742	[Next time you plan to tweet something
442.742	stupid before you take off,
445.983	make sure you are getting
445.983	on a @Gogo flight!]
448.158	(Laughter)
450.588	A lot of companies were making
450.588	good money that night.
453.218	You know, Justine's name was normally
453.218	Googled 40 times a month.
457.159	That month, between December the 20th
457.159	and the end of December,
460.511	her name was Googled 1,220,000 times.
465.893	And one Internet economist told me
465.893	that that meant that Google made
469.442	somewhere between 120,000 dollars
469.442	and 468,000 dollars
474.476	from Justine's annihilation, whereas
474.476	those of us doing the actual shaming --
478.566	we got nothing.
479.744	(Laughter)
480.768	We were like unpaid
480.768	shaming interns for Google.
484.242	(Laughter)
487.553	And then came the trolls:
489.973	[I'm actually kind of hoping
489.973	Justine Sacco gets aids? lol]
492.728	Somebody else on that wrote,
494.158	"""Somebody HIV-positive should rape"
494.158	this bitch and then we'll find out
497.431	"if her skin color protects her from AIDS."""
499.534	And that person got a free pass.
502.137	Nobody went after that person.
504.248	We were all so excited
504.248	about destroying Justine,
506.907	and our shaming brains
506.907	are so simple-minded,
509.558	that we couldn't also handle
509.558	destroying somebody
511.967	who was inappropriately
511.967	destroying Justine.
515.695	Justine was really uniting
515.695	a lot of disparate groups that night,
519.247	"from philanthropists to ""rape the bitch."""
522.667	[@JustineSacco I hope you get fired!
522.667	You demented bitch...
526.53	Just let the world know you're planning
526.53	to ride bare back while in Africa.]
530.142	Women always have it worse than men.
532.191	When a man gets shamed, it's,
532.191	"""I'm going to get you fired."""
535.316	When a woman gets shamed, it's,
537.038	"""I'm going to get you fired"
537.038	"and raped and cut out your uterus."""
541.943	And then Justine's employers got involved:
544.376	[IAC on @JustineSacco tweet: This is an
544.376	outrageous, offensive comment.
547.706	Employee in question currently
547.706	unreachable on an intl flight.]
550.704	And that's when the anger
550.704	turned to excitement:
552.926	[All I want for Christmas is to see
552.926	@JustineSacco's face when her plane lands
556.572	and she checks
556.572	her inbox/voicemail. #fired]
558.597	[Oh man, @justinesacco
558.597	is going to have the most painful
561.312	phone-turning-on moment ever
561.312	when her plane lands.]
563.735	[We are about to watch this @JustineSacco
563.735	bitch get fired. In REAL time.
567.175	Before she even KNOWS
567.175	she's getting fired.]
569.223	What we had was
569.223	a delightful narrative arc.
571.26	We knew something that Justine didn't.
573.109	Can you think of anything
573.109	less judicial than this?
575.474	Justine was asleep on a plane
575.474	and unable to explain herself,
578.375	and her inability was
578.375	a huge part of the hilarity.
582.529	On Twitter that night, we were
582.529	like toddlers crawling towards a gun.
587.66	Somebody worked out exactly
587.66	which plane she was on, so they linked
590.818	to a flight tracker website.
592.941	[British Airways Flight 43
592.941	On-time - arrives in 1 hour 34 minutes]
596.077	A hashtag began trending worldwide:
598.556	# hasJustineLandedYet?
601.182	[It is kinda wild
601.182	to see someone self-destruct
603.372	without them even being aware of it.
603.372	#hasJustineLandedYet]
606.119	[Seriously. I just want to go home
606.119	to go to bed, but everyone at the bar
609.537	is SO into #HasJustineLandedYet.
609.537	Can't look away. Can't leave.]
612.521	[#HasJustineLandedYet may be the best
612.521	thing to happen to my Friday night.]
616.031	[Is no one in Cape Town going
616.031	to the airport to tweet her arrival?
619.158	Come on, twitter! I'd like pictures]
620.901	And guess what? Yes there was.
622.441	[@JustineSacco HAS in fact landed
622.441	at Cape Town international.
625.331	And if you want to know
625.331	what it looks like to discover
627.887	that you've just been torn to shreds
627.887	because of a misconstrued liberal joke,
631.486	not by trolls, but by nice people like us,
633.518	this is what it looks like:
635.088	[... She's decided to wear
635.088	sunnies as a disguise.]
637.766	So why did we do it?
639.933	I think some people were genuinely upset,
642.858	but I think for other people,
644.31	it's because Twitter is basically
644.31	a mutual approval machine.
647.357	We surround ourselves with people
647.357	who feel the same way we do,
650.3	and we approve each other,
651.587	and that's a really good feeling.
653.262	And if somebody gets in the way,
653.262	we screen them out.
655.934	And do you know what
655.934	that's the opposite of?
658.045	It's the opposite of democracy.
660.336	We wanted to show that we cared
660.336	about people dying of AIDS in Africa.
664.357	Our desire to be seen to be compassionate
664.357	is what led us to commit
668.388	this profoundly un-compassionate act.
671.887	As Meghan O'Gieblyn wrote
671.887	in the Boston Review,
674.441	"""This isn't social justice."
674.441	"It's a cathartic alternative."""
679.686	For the past three years,
680.909	I've been going around the world
680.909	meeting people like Justine Sacco --
684.211	and believe me, there's a lot
684.211	of people like Justine Sacco.
687.019	There's more every day.
688.749	And we want to think they're fine,
688.749	but they're not fine.
692.065	The people I met were mangled.
694.224	They talked to me about depression,
696.089	and anxiety and insomnia
696.089	and suicidal thoughts.
700.029	One woman I talked to,
700.029	who also told a joke that landed badly,
704.792	she stayed home for a year and a half.
707.427	Before that, she worked with adults
707.427	with learning difficulties,
711.893	and was apparently really good at her job.
715.306	Justine was fired, of course,
715.306	because social media demanded it.
719.607	But it was worse than that.
721.375	She was losing herself.
723.358	She was waking up in the middle
723.358	of the night, forgetting who she was.
728.079	She was got because she was perceived
728.079	to have misused her privilege.
732.059	And of course, that's a much better thing
732.059	to get people for than the things
735.644	we used to get people for,
735.644	like having children out of wedlock.
738.828	"But the phrase ""misuse of privilege"""
738.828	is becoming a free pass
741.683	to tear apart pretty much
741.683	anybody we choose to.
745.135	It's becoming a devalued term,
747.465	and it's making us lose
747.465	our capacity for empathy
750.474	and for distinguishing between serious
750.474	and unserious transgressions.
756.334	Justine had 170 Twitter followers,
756.334	and so to make it work,
759.887	she had to be fictionalized.
761.88	Word got around that she was the daughter
761.88	the mining billionaire Desmond Sacco.
766.719	[Let us not be fooled by #JustineSacco
766.719	her father is a SA mining billionaire.
770.367	She's not sorry.
770.367	And neither is her father.]
772.446	I thought that was true about Justine,
774.293	until I met her at a bar, and I asked her
774.293	about her billionaire father,
777.655	"and she said, ""My father sells carpets."""
779.592	And I think back on
779.592	the early days of Twitter,
781.773	when people would admit
781.773	shameful secrets about themselves,
784.527	and other people would say,
784.527	"""Oh my God, I'm exactly the same."""
787.477	These days, the hunt is on
787.477	for people's shameful secrets.
791.674	You can lead a good, ethical life,
793.74	but some bad phraseology in a Tweet
793.74	can overwhelm it all,
798.198	become a clue to your secret inner evil.
801.797	Maybe there's two types
801.797	of people in the world:
804.26	those people who favor
804.26	humans over ideology,
807.811	and those people who favor
807.811	ideology over humans.
811.107	I favor humans over ideology,
813.779	but right now, the ideologues are winning,
816.564	and they're creating a stage
816.564	for constant artificial high dramas
821.258	where everybody's either
821.258	a magnificent hero
823.71	or a sickening villain,
825.342	even though we know that's not true
825.342	about our fellow humans.
828.383	What's true is that
828.383	we are clever and stupid;
832.393	what's true is that we're grey areas.
835.603	The great thing about social media
835.603	was how it gave a voice
838.505	to voiceless people,
839.925	but we're now creating
839.925	a surveillance society,
842.603	where the smartest way to survive
842.603	is to go back to being voiceless.
847.423	Let's not do that.
848.88	Thank you.
850.056	(Applause)
861.41	Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Jon.
862.919	Jon Ronson: Thanks, Bruno.
864.189	BG: Don't go away.
866.939	What strikes me about Justine's story
868.758	is also the fact that if you
868.758	Google her name today,
871.215	this story covers the first
873.986	there is nothing else about her.
876.222	In your book, you mention another story
878.834	of another victim who actually got
878.834	taken on by a reputation management firm,
883.389	and by creating blogs and posting nice,
883.389	innocuous stories about her love for cats
888.497	and holidays and stuff,
888.497	managed to get the story
891.237	off the first couple pages of Google
891.237	results, but it didn't last long.
895.184	A couple of weeks later, they started
895.184	creeping back up to the top result.
900.161	Is this a totally lost battle?
902.483	Jon Ronson: You know, I think
902.483	the very best thing we can do,
905.341	if you see a kind of unfair
905.341	or an ambiguous shaming,
909.939	is to speak up, because I think
909.939	the worst thing that happened to Justine
913.363	was that nobody supported her --
913.363	like, everyone was against her,
916.403	and that is profoundly traumatizing,
918.152	to be told by tens of thousands of people
918.152	that you need to get out.
921.998	But if a shaming happens and there's
921.998	a babble of voices, like in a democracy,
926.112	where people are discussing it,
926.112	I think that's much less damaging.
929.232	So I think that's the way forward,
930.883	but it's hard, because if you do
930.883	stand up for somebody,
933.503	it's incredibly unpleasant.
935.223	BG: So let's talk about your experience,
937.167	because you stood up by writing this book.
939.199	By the way, it's mandatory
939.199	reading for everybody, okay?
941.812	You stood up because the book
941.812	actually puts the spotlight on shamers.
946.146	And I assume you didn't only
946.146	have friendly reactions on Twitter.
949.202	JR: It didn't go down that well
949.202	with some people.
951.906	(Laughter)
952.931	I mean, you don't want
952.931	to just concentrate --
955.059	because lots of people understood,
955.059	and were really nice about the book.
958.48	But yeah, for 30 years I've been writing
958.48	stories about abuses of power,
961.857	and when I say the powerful people
961.857	over there in the military,
965.161	or in the pharmaceutical industry,
965.161	everybody applauds me.
967.953	"As soon as I say, ""We are the powerful"
967.953	"people abusing our power now,"""
972.352	I get people saying,
972.352	"""Well you must be a racist too."""
975.1	BG: So the other night --
975.1	yesterday -- we were at dinner,
977.799	and there were two discussions going on.
979.738	On one side you were talking
979.738	with people around the table --
982.81	and that was a nice,
982.81	constructive discussion.
984.997	On the other, every time
984.997	you turned to your phone,
987.368	there is this deluge of insults.
988.953	JR: Yeah. This happened last night.
988.953	We had like a TED dinner last night.
992.368	We were chatting and it was lovely
992.368	and nice, and I decided to check Twitter.
996.192	"Somebody said, ""You are"
996.192	"a white supremacist."""
998.336	And then I went back and had
998.336	a nice conversation with somebody,
1001.334	and then I went back to Twitter,
1002.899	somebody said my very existence
1002.899	made the world a worse place.
1006.011	My friend Adam Curtis says
1008.782	that maybe the Internet is like
1008.782	a John Carpenter movie from the 1980s,
1012.614	when eventually everyone
1012.614	will start screaming at each other
1015.679	and shooting each other,
1015.679	and then eventually everybody
1018.233	would flee to somewhere safer,
1020.253	and I'm starting to think of that
1020.253	as a really nice option.
1024.177	BG: Jon, thank you.
1024.177	JR: Thank you, Bruno.
1026.154	(Applause)
