15.26	By the end of this year,
17.26	there'll be nearly a billion people on this planet
20.26	that actively use social networking sites.
22.26	The one thing that all of them have in common
24.26	is that they're going to die.
27.26	While that might be a somewhat morbid thought,
30.26	I think it has some really profound implications
32.26	that are worth exploring.
34.26	What first got me thinking about this
37.26	was a blog post authored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller,
40.26	who was a science and technology journalist
43.26	who died of cancer.
45.26	And what Miller did was have his family and friends write a post
48.26	that went out shortly after he died.
50.26	Here's what he wrote in starting that out.
52.26	"He said, ""Here it is. I'm dead,"
54.26	and this is my last post to my blog.
56.26	In advance, I asked that once my body finally shut down
59.26	from the punishments of my cancer,
61.26	then my family and friends publish this prepared message I wrote --
64.26	the first part of the process
66.26	"of turning this from an active website to an archive."""
69.26	Now, while as a journalist,
71.26	Miller's archive may have been better written
73.26	and more carefully curated than most,
75.26	the fact of the matter is that all of us today
77.26	are creating an archive
79.26	that's something completely different
81.26	than anything that's been created
83.26	by any previous generation.
85.26	Consider a few stats for a moment.
87.26	Right now there are 48 hours of video
89.26	being uploaded to YouTube every single minute.
92.26	There are 200 million Tweets being posted every day.
96.26	And the average Facebook user
99.26	is creating 90 pieces of content each month.
103.26	So when you think about your parents or your grandparents,
106.26	at best they may have created
108.26	some photos or home videos,
110.26	or a diary that lives in a box somewhere.
113.26	But today we're all creating this incredibly rich digital archive
116.26	that's going to live in the cloud indefinitely,
118.26	years after we're gone.
120.26	And I think that's going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities
123.26	for technologists.
125.26	Now to be clear, I'm a journalist and not a technologist,
127.26	so what I'd like to do briefly
129.26	is paint a picture
131.26	of what the present and the future are going to look like.
134.26	Now we're already seeing some services
136.26	that are designed to let us decide
138.26	what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts
141.26	after we die.
143.26	One of them actually, fittingly enough,
145.26	found me when I checked into a deli
147.26	at a restaurant in New York
149.26	on foursquare.
152.26	(Recording) Adam Ostrow: Hello.
154.26	Death: Adam?
156.26	AO: Yeah.
158.26	Death: Death can catch you anywhere, anytime,
161.26	even at the Organic.
164.26	AO: Who is this?
166.26	Death: Go to ifidie.net
169.26	before it's too late.
171.26	(Laughter)
173.26	Adam Ostrow: Kind of creepy, right?
175.26	So what that service does, quite simply,
177.26	is let you create a message or a video
179.26	that can be posted to Facebook after you die.
182.26	Another service right now
184.26	is called 1,000 Memories.
186.26	And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones,
188.26	complete with photos and videos and stories
191.26	that they can post after you die.
194.26	But what I think comes next is far more interesting.
197.26	Now a lot of you are probably familiar with Deb Roy
200.26	who, back in March,
202.26	demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of home video.
206.26	I think as machines' ability
208.26	to understand human language and process vast amounts of data
210.26	continues to improve,
212.26	it's going to become possible
214.26	to analyze an entire life's worth of content --
216.26	the Tweets, the photos, the videos, the blog posts --
219.26	that we're producing in such massive numbers.
221.26	And I think as that happens,
223.26	it's going to become possible for our digital personas
226.26	to continue to interact in the real world long after we're gone
229.26	thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we're creating
232.26	and technology's ability to make sense of it all.
235.26	Now we're already starting to see some experiments here.
238.26	One service called My Next Tweet
240.26	analyzes your entire Twitter stream, everything you've posted onto Twitter,
243.26	to make some predictions as to what you might say next.
246.26	Well right now, as you can see,
248.26	the results can be somewhat comical.
250.26	You can imagine what something like this might look like
252.26	five, 10 or 20 years from now
254.26	as our technical capabilities improve.
257.26	Taking it a step further,
259.26	MIT's media lab is working on robots
261.26	that can interact more like humans.
264.26	But what if those robots were able to interact
266.26	based on the unique characteristics of a specific person
269.26	based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content
271.26	that person produces in their lifetime?
274.26	Finally, think back to this famous scene
276.26	from election night 2008
278.26	back in the United States,
280.26	where CNN beamed a live hologram
282.26	of hip hop artist will.i.am into their studio
284.26	for an interview with Anderson Cooper.
287.26	What if we were able to use that same type of technology
289.26	to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms --
293.26	interacting in a very lifelike way
295.26	based on all the content they created while they were alive?
298.26	I think that's going to become completely possible
301.26	as the amount of data we're producing
303.26	and technology's ability to understand it
305.26	both expand exponentially.
308.26	Now in closing, I think what we all need to be thinking about
310.26	is if we want that to become our reality --
312.26	and if so,
314.26	what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it.
317.26	Thank you very much.
319.26	(Applause)
