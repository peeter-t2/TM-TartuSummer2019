14.318	The brain is an amazing and complex organ.
17.627	And while many people
17.627	are fascinated by the brain,
20.093	they can't really tell you that much
21.865	about the properties
21.865	about how the brain works
24.142	because we don't teach
24.142	neuroscience in schools.
26.455	And one of the reasons
26.455	why is that the equipment
28.898	is so complex and so expensive
31.557	that it's really only done at major
31.557	universities and large institutions.
35.703	And so in order to be able
35.703	to access the brain,
37.942	you really need to dedicate your life
39.767	and spend six and a half years
39.767	as a graduate student
42.247	just to become a neuroscientist
42.247	to get access to these tools.
45.202	And that's a shame
45.202	because one out of five of us,
47.539	that's 20 percent of the entire world,
47.539	will have a neurological disorder.
51.365	And there are zero cures
51.365	for these diseases.
54.796	And so it seems that
54.796	what we should be doing
57.015	is reaching back earlier
57.015	in the eduction process
59.432	and teaching students about neuroscience
59.432	so that in the future,
64.009	they may be thinking about possibly
64.009	becoming a brain scientist.
68.064	When I was a graduate student,
68.064	my lab mate Tim Marzullo and myself,
71.758	decided that what if we took
71.758	this complex equipment that we have
75.639	for studying the brain and made it simple
75.639	enough and affordable enough
79.038	that anyone that you know, an amateur
79.038	or a high school student,
82.354	could learn and actually participate
82.354	in the discovery of neuroscience.
85.836	And so we did just that.
87.573	A few years ago, we started
87.573	a company called Backyard Brains
90.466	and we make DIY neuroscience equipment
90.466	and I brought some here tonight,
94.871	and I want to do some demonstrations.
97.377	You guys want to see some?
98.811	So I need a volunteer.
101.774	So right before -- what is your name?
101.774	(Applause)
104.027	Sam Kelly: Sam.
105.07	Greg Gage: All right, Sam, I'm going
105.07	to record from your brain.
108.095	Have you had this before?
109.849	SK: No.
110.95	GG: I need you to stick out
110.95	your arm for science,
113.264	roll up your sleeve a bit,
114.833	So what I'm going to do,
114.833	I'm putting electrodes on your arm,
117.713	and you're probably wondering,
119.202	I just said I'm going to record from your
119.202	brain, what am I doing with your arm?
122.941	Well, you have about 80 billion neurons
122.941	inside your brain right now.
126.175	They're sending electrical messages
126.175	back and forth, and chemical messages.
129.663	But some of your neurons
129.663	right here in your motor cortex
132.336	are going to send messages down
132.336	when you move your arm like this.
135.431	They're going to go down
135.431	across your corpus callosum,
137.915	down onto your spinal cord
137.915	to your lower motor neuron
140.449	out to your muscles here,
141.718	and that electrical discharge
141.718	is going to be picked up
144.327	by these electrodes right here
145.861	and we're going to be able to listen
147.583	to exactly what your brain
147.583	is going to be doing.
149.835	So I'm going to turn this on for a second.
151.835	Have you ever heard
151.835	what your brain sounds like?
154.131	SK: No.
155.166	GG: Let's try it out.
155.166	So go ahead and squeeze your hand.
157.9	(Rumbling)
158.972	So what you're listening to,
160.848	so this is your motor units
160.848	happening right here.
164.111	Let's take a look at it as well.
166.192	So I'm going to stand over here,
169.009	and I'm going to open up our app here.
172.028	So now I want you to squeeze.
173.727	(Rumbling)
174.816	So right here, these are the motor units
174.816	that are happening
177.674	from her spinal cord
177.674	out to her muscle right here,
180.133	and as she's doing it,
181.355	you're seeing the electrical activity
181.355	that's happening here.
184.189	You can even click here
184.189	and try to see one of them.
186.63	So keep doing it really hard.
188.101	So now we've paused
189.171	on one motor action potential that's
189.171	happening right now inside of your brain.
193.451	Do you guys want to see some more?
195.227	(Applause)
196.81	That's interesting,
196.81	but let's get it better.
198.954	I need one more volunteer.
201.857	What is your name, sir?
204	Miguel Goncalves: Miguel.
205.269	GG: Miguel, all right.
206.4	You're going to stand right here.
207.976	So when you're moving your arm like this,
209.968	your brain is sending a signal
209.968	down to your muscles right here.
213.083	I want you to move your arm as well.
214.857	So your brain is going to send
214.857	a signal down to your muscles.
217.731	And so it turns out that there is
217.731	a nerve that's right here
221.58	that runs up here that innervates
221.58	these three fingers,
224.336	and it's close enough to the skin
224.336	that we might be able
227.012	to stimulate that so that what we can do
229.346	is copy your brain signals
229.346	going out to your hand
232.832	and inject it into your hand,
234.353	so that your hand will move
234.353	when your brain tells your hand to move.
237.726	So in a sense, she will take away
237.726	your free will
240.933	and you will no longer have
240.933	any control over this hand.
243.964	You with me?
245.567	So I just need to hook you up.
247.618	(Laughter)
249.369	So I'm going to find your ulnar nerve,
251.43	which is probably right around here.
254.63	You don't know what you're signing up for
256.631	when you come up.
257.734	So now I'm going to move away
257.734	and we're going to plug it in
260.524	to our human-to-human interface over here.
264.345	Okay, so Sam, I want you
264.345	to squeeze your hand again.
269.194	Do it again. Perfect.
271.152	So now I'm going to hook you up
271.152	over here so that you get the --
274.155	It's going to feel
274.155	a little bit weird at first,
276.399	this is going to feel like a --
276.399	(Laughter)
278.863	You know, when you lose your free will,
278.863	and someone else becomes your agent,
282.68	it does feel a bit strange.
284.306	Now I want you to relax your hand.
286.208	Sam, you're with me?
287.532	So you're going to squeeze.
288.997	I'm not going to turn it on yet,
288.997	so go ahead and give it a squeeze.
292.284	So now, are you ready, Miguel?
294.24	MG: Ready as I'll ever be.
296.062	GG: I've turned it on, so go ahead
296.062	and turn your hand.
299.265	Do you feel that a little bit?
299.265	MG: Nope.
301.298	GG: Okay, do it again?
301.298	MG: A little bit.
303.198	GG: A little bit? (Laughter)
304.884	So relax.
305.909	So hit it again.
307.325	(Laughter)
308.521	Oh, perfect, perfect.
310.226	So relax, do it again.
312.11	All right, so right now,
314.878	your brain is controlling your arm
314.878	and it's also controlling his arm,
319.279	so go ahead and just do it one more time.
321.471	All right, so it's perfect. (Laughter)
323.504	So now, what would happen
323.504	if I took over my control of your hand?
327.265	And so, just relax your hand.
329.508	What happens?
331.726	Ah, nothing.
332.76	Why not?
334.298	Because the brain has to do it.
335.993	So you do it again.
337.346	All right, that's perfect.
339.78	Thank you guys for being
339.78	such a good sport.
342.319	This is what's happening
342.319	all across the world --
344.575	electrophysiology!
345.911	We're going to bring on
345.911	the neuro-revolution.
348.158	Thank you.
349.175	(Applause)
