26	This is me. My name is Ben Saunders.
27	I specialize in dragging heavy things
29	around cold places.
31	On May 11th last year,
33	I stood alone at the North geographic Pole.
36	I was the only human being in an area
38	one-and-a-half times the size of America,
40	five-and-a-half thousand square miles.
42	More than 2,000 people have climbed Everest.
46	Including me, only four people
48	have skied solo to the North Pole.
51	And I think the reason for that --
53	(Applause)
57	-- thank you -- I think the reason for that is that it's -- it's --
59	well, it's as Chris said, bonkers.
61	It's a journey that is right at the limit
64	of human capability.
66	I skied the equivalent of 31 marathons
68	back to back. 800 miles in 10 weeks.
71	And I was dragging all the food I needed,
73	the supplies, the equipment, sleeping bag,
75	one change of underwear -- everything I needed for nearly three months.
78	(Laughter)
81	What we're going to try and do today, in the 16 and a bit minutes I've got left,
84	is to try and answer three questions. The first one is, why?
87	The second one is,
89	how do you go to the loo at minus 40?
91	"""Ben, I've read somewhere that at minus 40,"
94	"exposed skin becomes frostbitten in less than a minute, so how do you answer the call of nature?"""
97	I don't want to answer these now. I'll come on to them at the end.
100	Third one: how do you top that? What's next?
104	It all started back in 2001.
106	My first expedition was with a guy called Pen Hadow -- enormously experienced chap.
109	This was like my polar apprenticeship.
112	We were trying to ski from this group of islands up here,
115	Severnaya Zemlya, to the North Pole.
117	And the thing that fascinates me about the North Pole,
119	geographic North Pole, is that it's slap bang in the middle of the sea.
122	This is about as good as maps get,
124	and to reach it you've got to ski literally
126	over the frozen crust,
128	the floating skin of ice on the Artic Ocean.
131	I'd spoken to all the experts.
133	I'd read lots of books. I studied maps and charts.
135	But I realized on the morning of day one
137	that I had no idea exactly
139	what I'd let myself in for.
141	I was 23 years old. No one my age
143	had attempted anything like this,
145	and pretty quickly, almost everything
147	that could have gone wrong did go wrong.
149	We were attacked by a polar bear on day two.
152	I had frostbite in my left big toe.
155	We started running very low on food. We were both pretty hungry, losing lots of weight.
158	Some very unusual weather conditions, very difficult ice conditions.
162	We had
164	decidedly low-tech communications.
166	We couldn't afford a satellite phone, so we had HF radio.
169	You can see two ski poles sticking out of the roof of the tent.
171	There's a wire dangling down either side.
173	That was our HF radio antenna.
175	We had less than two hours
177	two-way communication with the outside world in two months.
181	Ultimately, we ran out of time.
183	We'd skied 400 miles. We were just over 200 miles left
186	to go to the Pole, and we'd run out of time.
188	We were too late into the summer; the ice was starting to melt;
190	we spoke to the Russian helicopter pilots on the radio,
192	"and they said, ""Look boys, you've run out of time."
194	"We've got to pick you up."""
196	And I felt that I had failed, wholeheartedly.
199	I was a failure.
201	The one goal, the one dream I'd had
203	for as long as I could remember -- I hadn't even come close.
207	And skiing along that first trip, I had two
209	imaginary video clips that I'd replay over and over again in my mind
212	when the going got tough, just to keep my motivation going.
215	The first one was reaching the Pole itself.
218	I could see vividly, I suppose,
220	being filmed out of the door of a helicopter, there was, kind of, rock music playing in the background,
223	and I had a ski pole with a Union Jack, you know, flying in the wind.
226	I could see myself sticking the flag in a pole, you know --
229	ah, glorious moment -- the music kind of reaching a crescendo.
231	The second video clip
233	that I imagined was getting back to Heathrow airport,
235	and I could see again, vividly,
237	the camera flashbulbs going off,
239	the paparazzi, the autograph hunters,
242	the book agents coming to sign me up for a deal.
244	And of course, neither of these things happened.
247	We didn't get to the Pole, and we didn't have any money
250	to pay anyone to do the PR, so no one had heard
252	of this expedition.
254	And I got back to Heathrow. My mum was there; my brother was there;
257	my granddad was there -- had a little Union Jack --
260	(Laughter)
262	-- and that was about it. I went back to live with my mum.
264	I was physically exhausted,
266	mentally an absolute wreck, considered myself a failure.
269	In a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition,
271	and lying on my mum's sofa,
273	day in day out, watching daytime TV.
277	My brother sent me a text message, an SMS --
279	"it was a quote from the ""Simpsons."" It said,"
281	"""You tried your hardest and failed miserably."
285	"The lesson is: don't even try."""
287	(Laughter)
288	Fast forward three years. I did eventually get off the sofa,
291	and start planning another expedition. This time,
293	I wanted to go right across, on my own this time,
295	from Russia, at the top of the map,
297	to the North Pole, where the sort of kink in the middle is,
299	and then on to Canada.
301	No one has made a complete crossing of the Arctic Ocean on their own.
304	Two Norwegians did it as a team in 2000. No one's done it solo.
308	Very famous, very accomplished Italian mountaineer,
312	Reinhold Messner, tried it in 1995,
313	and he was rescued after a week.
315	He described this expedition as 10 times
318	as dangerous as Everest.
320	So for some reason, this was what I wanted to have a crack at,
325	but I knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece,
327	let alone make it across to Canada,
329	I had to take a radical approach.
332	This meant everything from perfecting the
334	sawn-off, sub-two-gram toothbrush,
337	to working with one of the world's leading nutritionists
339	in developing a completely new,
341	revolutionary nutritional strategy from scratch:
344	6,000 calories a day.
346	And the expedition started in February last year.
349	Big support team. We had a film crew,
351	a couple of logistics people with us,
353	my girlfriend, a photographer.
356	At first it was pretty sensible. We flew British Airways to Moscow.
360	The next bit in Siberia to Krasnoyarsk,
362	on a Russian internal airline called KrasAir,
365	spelled K-R-A-S.
367	The next bit, we'd chartered a pretty elderly Russian plane
370	to fly us up to a town called Khatanga,
372	which was the sort of last bit of civilization.
375	Our cameraman, who it turned out was a pretty nervous flier at the best of times,
379	actually asked the pilot, before we got on the plane, how long this flight would take,
381	and the pilot -- Russian pilot -- completely deadpan, replied,
384	"""Six hours -- if we live."""
387	(Laughter)
390	We got to Khatanga.
392	I think the joke is that Khatanga isn't the end of the world,
395	but you can see it from there.
397	(Laughter)
398	It was supposed to be an overnight stay. We were stuck there for 10 days.
401	There was a kind of vodka-fueled pay dispute between
403	the helicopter pilots and the people that owned the helicopter,
405	so we were stuck. We couldn't move.
407	Finally, morning of day 11, we got the all-clear,
410	loaded up the helicopters -- two helicopters flying in tandem --
414	dropped me off at the edge of the pack ice.
416	We had a frantic sort of 45 minutes of filming,
419	photography; while the helicopter was still there,
421	I did an interview on the satellite phone;
423	and then everyone else climbed back into the helicopter,
427	wham, the door closed, and I was alone.
432	And I don't know if words will ever quite do that moment justice.
434	All I could think about was running back up to the door,
436	"banging on the door, and saying, ""Look guys,"
438	"I haven't quite thought this through."""
440	(Laughter)
445	To make things worse, you can just see the white dot
447	up at the top right hand side of the screen; that's a full moon.
450	Because we'd been held up in Russia, of course,
452	the full moon brings the highest and lowest tides;
454	when you're standing on the frozen surface of the sea,
457	high and low tides generally mean
459	that interesting things are going to happen -- the ice is going to start moving around a bit.
463	I was, you can see there, pulling two sledges.
465	Grand total in all, 95 days of food and fuel,
471	When the ice was flat or flattish,
473	I could just about pull both.
475	When the ice wasn't flat, I didn't have a hope in hell.
477	I had to pull one, leave it, and go back and get the other one.
479	Literally scrambling through what's called pressure ice --
482	the ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean,
485	the wind and the tides.
488	NASA described the ice conditions last year as the worst since records began.
493	And it's always drifting. The pack ice is always drifting.
496	I was skiing into headwinds for nine
498	out of the 10 weeks I was alone last year,
500	and I was drifting backwards most of the time.
503	My record was minus 2.5 miles.
506	I got up in the morning, took the tent down, skied north for seven-and-a-half hours,
509	put the tent up, and I was two and a half miles further back
512	than when I'd started.
514	I literally couldn't keep up with the drift of the ice.
518	(Video): So it's day 22.
523	I'm lying in the tent, getting ready to go.
526	The weather is just appalling --
528	oh, drifted back about five miles
531	in the last -- last night.
533	Later in the expedition, the problem was no longer the ice.
536	It was a lack of ice -- open water.
538	I knew this was happening. I knew the Artic was warming.
541	I knew there was more open water. And I had a secret weapon up my sleeve.
544	This was my little bit of bio-mimicry.
546	Polar bears on the Artic Ocean move in dead straight lines.
550	If they come to water, they'll climb in, swim across it.
552	So we had a dry suit developed -- I worked with a team in Norway --
555	based on a sort of survival suit --
557	I suppose, that helicopter pilots would wear --
559	that I could climb into. It would go on over my boots, over my mittens,
561	it would pull up around my face, 
561	and seal pretty tightly around my face.
564	And this meant I could ski
566	over very thin ice,
568	and if I fell through, it wasn't the end of the world.
570	It also meant, if the worst came to the worst,
572	I could actually jump in and swim across
574	and drag the sledge over after me.
577	Some pretty radical technology,
579	a radical approach --but it worked perfectly.
581	Another exciting thing we did last year
583	was with communications technology.
586	In 1912, Shackleton's Endurance expedition --
589	there was -- one of his crew, a guy called Thomas Orde-Lees.
592	"He said, ""The explorers of 2012,"
594	if there is anything left to explore,
596	will no doubt carry pocket wireless telephones
599	"fitted with wireless telescopes."""
602	Well, Orde-Lees guessed wrong by about eight years. This is my pocket wireless telephone,
605	Iridium satellite phone.
607	The wireless telescope was a digital camera I had tucked in my pocket.
610	And every single day of the 72 days I was alone on the ice,
612	I was blogging live from my tent,
615	sending back a little diary piece,
617	sending back information on the distance I'd covered --
619	the ice conditions, the temperature --
621	and a daily photo.
623	Remember, 2001,
625	we had less than two hours radio contact with the outside world.
629	Last year, blogging live from an expedition
631	that's been described as 10 times as dangerous as Everest.
634	It wasn't all high-tech. This is navigating
636	in what's called a whiteout.
638	When you get lots of mist, low cloud, the wind starts blowing the snow up.
641	You can't see an awful lot. You can just see, there's a yellow
643	ribbon tied to one of my ski poles.
645	I'd navigate using the direction of the wind.
647	So, kind of a weird combination of high-tech and low-tech.
650	I got to the Pole on the 11th of May.
652	It took me 68 days to get there from Russia,
654	and there is nothing there.
657	(Laughter).
659	There isn't even a pole at the Pole. There's nothing there,
661	purely because it's sea ice. It's drifting.
664	Stick a flag there, leave it there, pretty soon it will drift off, usually towards Canada or Greenland.
667	I knew this, but I was expecting something.
672	Strange mixture of feelings: it was extremely warm by this stage,
676	a lot of open water around, and
678	of course, elated that I'd got there under my own steam,
681	but starting to really realize
684	that my chances of making it all the way across to Canada,
686	which was still 400 miles away,
688	were slim at best.
690	The only proof I've got that I was there
692	is a blurry photo of my GPS, the little satellite navigation gadget.
695	You can just see --
697	there's a nine and a string of zeros here.
700	Ninety degrees north -- that is slap bang in the North Pole.
704	I took a photo of that. Sat down on my sledge. Did a sort of video diary piece.
707	Took a few photos. I got my satellite phone out.
709	I warmed the battery up in my armpit.
711	I dialed three numbers. I dialed my mum.
714	I dialed my girlfriend. I dialed the CEO of my sponsor.
716	And I got three voicemails.
719	(Laughter)
725	(Video): Ninety.
732	It's a special feeling.
734	The entire planet
736	is rotating
738	beneath my feet.
742	The -- the whole world underneath me.
744	I finally got through to my mum. She was at the queue of the supermarket.
747	She started crying. She asked me to call her back.
750	(Laughter)
752	I skied on for a week past the Pole.
754	I wanted to get as close to Canada as I could
756	before conditions just got too dangerous to continue.
759	This was the last day I had on the ice.
761	When I spoke to the -- my project management team,
763	"they said, ""Look, Ben, conditions are getting too dangerous."
768	There are huge areas of open water just south of your position.
770	We'd like to pick you up.
772	"Ben, could you please look for an airstrip?"""
774	This was the view outside my tent
777	when I had this fateful phone call.
781	I'd never tried to build an airstrip before. Tony, the expedition manager, he said,
783	"""Look Ben, you've got to find 500 meters of"
785	"flat, thick safe ice."""
787	The only bit of ice I could find --
789	it took me 36 hours of skiing around trying to find an airstrip --
793	was exactly 473 meters. I could measure it with my skis.
796	I didn't tell Tony that. I didn't tell the pilots that.
798	I thought, it'll have to do.
801	(Video): Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
804	It just about worked. A pretty dramatic landing --
807	the plane actually passed over four times,
809	and I was a bit worried it wasn't going to land at all.
811	The pilot, I knew, was called Troy. I was expecting someone called Troy
814	that did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy.
817	I was bawling my eyes out by the time the plane landed -- a pretty emotional moment.
821	So I thought, I've got to compose myself for Troy.
824	I'm supposed to be the roughty toughty explorer type.
828	The plane taxied up to where I was standing.
830	"The door opened. This guy jumped out. He's about that tall. He said, ""Hi, my name is Troy."""
833	(Laughter).
835	The co-pilot was a lady called Monica.
837	She sat there in a sort of hand-knitted jumper.
839	They were the least macho people I've ever met, but they made my day.
843	Troy was smoking a cigarette on the ice;
845	we took a few photos. He
847	"climbed up the ladder. He said, ""Just -- just get in the back."""
850	He threw his cigarette out as he got on the front,
852	and I climbed in the back.
854	(Laughter)
855	Taxied up and down the runway a few times,
857	"just to flatten it out a bit, and he said, ""Right, I'm going to --"
859	"I'm going to give it a go."" And he --"
862	I've now learned that this is standard practice, but it had me worried at the time.
864	He put his hand on the throttle.
866	You can see the control for the engines is actually on the roof of the cockpit.
869	It's that little bar there. He put his hand on the throttle.
871	Monica very gently put her hand sort of on top of his.
873	"I thought, ""God, here we go. We're, we're -- this is all or nothing."""
876	Rammed it forwards. Bounced down the runway. Just took off.
878	One of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge at the end of the runway,
881	banking. I could see into the cockpit, Troy battling the controls,
884	and he just took one hand off, reached back,
887	flipped a switch on the roof of the cockpit,
889	"and it was the ""fasten seat belt"" sign you can see on the wall."
893	(Laughter)
897	And only from the air did I see the big picture.
899	Of course, when you're on the ice, you only ever see one obstacle at a time,
901	whether it's a pressure ridge or there's a bit of water.
904	This is probably why I didn't get into trouble about the length of my airstrip.
907	I mean, it really was starting to break up.
909	Why? I'm not an explorer in the traditional sense.
912	I'm not skiing along drawing maps;
914	everyone knows where the North Pole is.
916	At the South Pole there's a big scientific base. There's an airstrip.
918	There's a cafe and there's a tourist shop.
921	For me, this is about exploring human limits,
924	about exploring the limits of physiology, of psychology
927	and of technology. They're the things that excite me.
930	And it's also about potential, on a personal level.
932	This, for me, is a chance to explore the limits --
935	really push the limits of my own potential, see how far they stretch.
938	And on a wider scale, it amazes me how people go through life
942	just scratching the surface of their potential,
945	just doing three or four or five percent
948	of what they're truly capable of. So,
950	on a wider scale, I hope that this journey
952	was a chance to inspire other people
954	to think about what they want to do
956	with their potential, and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time
959	we each have on this planet.
963	That's as close as I can come to summing that up.
965	The next question is, how do you answer the call of nature at minus 40?
968	The answer, of course, to which is a trade secret --
973	and the last question,
975	what's next? As quickly as possible,
977	if I have a minute left at the end, I'll go into more detail.
981	What's next:
983	Antarctica.
985	It's the coldest, highest,
987	windiest and driest continent on Earth.
991	Late 1911, early 1912,
993	there was a race to be the first
997	to the South Pole: the heart of the Antarctic continent.
999	If you include the coastal ice shelves, you can see that the Ross Ice Shelf --
1002	it's the big one down here -- the Ross Ice Shelf is the size of France.
1005	Antarctica, if you include the ice shelves,
1007	is twice the size of Australia -- it's a big place.
1009	And there's a race to get to the Pole between Amundsen,
1011	the Norwegian -- Amundsen had dog sleds and huskies --
1014	and Scott, the British guy, Captain Scott.
1016	Scott had sort of ponies and some tractors
1019	and a few dogs, all of which went wrong,
1021	and Scott and his team of four people ended up on foot.
1025	They got to the Pole late January 1912
1027	to find a Norwegian flag already there.
1030	There was a tent, a letter to the Norwegian king.
1032	And they turned around, headed back to the coast,
1035	and all five of them died on the return journey.
1038	Since then, no one has ever skied --
1040	this was 93 years ago -- since then, no one has ever skied
1043	from the coast of Antarctica to the Pole and back.
1046	Every South Pole expedition you may have heard about
1048	is either flown out from the Pole or has used vehicles
1050	or dogs or kites to do some kind of crossing --
1053	no one has ever made a return journey. So that's the plan.
1055	Two of us are doing it.
1057	That's pretty much it.
1060	One final thought before I get to the toilet bit, is --
1063	is, I have a -- and I meant to scan this and I've forgotten --
1066	but I have a -- I have a school report. I was 13 years old,
1069	and it's framed above my desk at home. It says,
1071	"""Ben lacks sufficient impetus"
1074	"to achieve anything worthwhile."""
1077	(Laughter)
1078	(Applause)
1081	I think if I've learned anything, it's this: that no one else
1083	is the authority on your potential.
1085	You're the only person that decides how far you go and what you're capable of.
1088	Ladies and gentlemen, that's my story.
1092	Thank you very much.
