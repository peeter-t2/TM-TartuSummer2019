12.766	I would like to start
14.543	with the story of Mary,
16.504	a woman from an African village.
19.495	Her first memories
21.088	are of her family fleeing violent riots
23.94	orchestrated by 
23.94	the ruling political party.
27.797	Her brother was murdered
27.797	by the state-sponsored militia,
31.794	and she was raped more than once
33.371	just because she belonged
33.371	to the wrong party.
38.61	One morning, a month before the election,
41.743	Mary's village was called 
41.743	to another intimidation meeting.
45.464	In this meeting, there is a man
45.464	standing in front of them,
48.243	"telling them, ""We know who you are,"
50.701	we know who you will vote for,
53.352	and if you're not going
53.352	to drop the right paper,
55.762	"we're going to take revenge."""
59.1	But for Mary, this meeting is different.
62.059	She feels different.
63.793	This time, she's waiting for this meeting,
66.43	because this time, she's carrying
66.43	a small hidden camera in her dress,
70.599	a camera that nobody else can see.
73.655	Nobody is allowed to film
73.655	in these meetings.
75.722	You risk your life if you do.
77.781	Mary knows that, but she also knows
77.781	that the only way to stop them
82.179	and to protect herself and her community
85.751	is to expose their intimidation,
88.066	to make sure they understand
88.066	somebody is following them,
92.048	to break the impunity they feel.
95.738	Mary and her friends were filming
95.738	for months, undercover,
99.724	the intimidation of
99.724	the ruling political party.
103.491	"(Video) [""Filmed with hidden cameras""]"
105.996	Man: We are now going to speak
105.996	about the upcoming elections.
110.317	Nothing can stop us 
110.317	from doing what we want.
113.747	If we hear you are with [The Opposition]
117.158	we will not forgive you.
119.694	"[""Militia intimidation rally""]"
124.635	[The Party] can torture you at any time.
127.258	The youth can beat you.
130.698	"[""Disruption of political meeting""]"
139.588	For those who lie, saying they 
139.588	are back with [The Party],
143.765	your time is running out.
146.138	"[""Party youth militia""]"
149.279	Some have died because they rebelled.
151.407	Some have lost their homes.
154.426	If you don't work together 
154.426	with [The Party],
158.19	you will lead a very bad life.
170.447	Oren Yakobovich: These images
170.447	were broadcast all over the world,
173.586	but more importantly,
175.183	they have been broadcast
175.183	back to the community.
178.336	The perpetrators saw them too.
181.22	They understood somebody
181.22	is following them.
183.461	They got scared. Impunity was broken.
187.07	Mary and her friends forced
187.07	the ruling political party
190.156	not to use violence during the election,
192.406	and saved hundreds of lives.
195.895	Mary is just one of hundreds of people
198.402	that my organization had helped 
198.402	to document human rights violations
201.962	using cameras.
204.862	My background should have
204.862	led me to a different direction.
208.223	I was born in Israel
208.223	to a right-wing family,
211.472	and as long as I remember myself,
213.378	I wanted to join the Israeli army
213.378	to serve my country
216.473	and prove what I believed 
216.473	was our right for the whole land.
220.924	I joined the Israeli army 
220.924	just after the first intifada,
226.204	the first Palestinian uprising,
228.584	and I served in one of the hard-minded,
230.492	toughest, aggressive infantry units,
234.012	and I got the biggest gun in my platoon.
238.971	Quite fast, I became an officer
241.431	and got soldiers under my command,
244.422	and as time passed, I started
244.422	serving in the West Bank,
247.347	and I saw these images.
257.811	I didn't like what I saw.
260.077	It took me a while,
261.496	but eventually I refused
261.496	to serve in the West Bank
264.738	and had to spend time in jail.
267.594	It was a bit —
268.754	(Applause) —
271.73	It was not that bad, I have to say.
273.422	It was a bit like being in a hotel,
273.422	but with very shitty food.
276.505	(Laughter)
278.17	In jail, I kept thinking 
278.17	that I need people to know.
282.042	I need people to understand
283.708	what the reality
283.708	in the West Bank looks like.
286.564	I need them to hear what I heard,
289.002	I need them to see what I saw,
290.906	but I also understood, we need 
290.906	the Palestinians themselves,
294.244	the people that are suffering,
295.733	to be able to tell their own stories,
297.965	not journalists or filmmakers
297.965	that are coming outside of the situation.
304.071	I joined a human rights organization,
306.649	an Israeli human rights 
306.649	organization called B'Tselem.
309.789	Together, we analyzed the West Bank
311.864	and picked 100 families that
311.864	are living in the most risky places:
315.789	close to checkpoints, near army bases,
319.604	side by side with settlers.
322.059	We gave them cameras and training.
325.901	Quite fast, we started getting
325.901	very disturbing images
330.231	about how the settlers 
330.231	and the soldiers are abusing them.
335.213	I would like to share with you
335.213	two clips from this project.
338.333	Both of them were broadcast in Israel,
338.333	and it created a massive debate.
342.478	And I have to warn you,
343.77	some of you might 
343.77	find them quite explicit.
347.03	The masked men you 
347.03	will see in the first clips
349.454	are Jewish settlers.
351.184	Minutes before the camera was turned on,
353.67	they approached a Palestinian family
355.548	that was working their land
357.36	and told them that they
357.36	have to leave the land,
359.567	because this land belongs
359.567	to the Jewish settlers.
362.119	The Palestinians refused.
364.046	Let's see what happened.
367.109	The masked men that are approaching
367.109	are Jewish settlers.
370.925	They are approaching
370.925	the Palestinian family.
393.087	This is a demonstration in the West Bank.
395.461	The guy in green is Palestinian.
397.063	He will be arrested in a second.
399.873	Here you see him
399.873	blindfolded and handcuffed.
402.706	In a few seconds, he regrets 
402.706	he came to this demonstration.
409.824	He's been shot in the foot
409.824	with a rubber bullet.
415.256	He is okay.
420.242	Not all the settlers and the soldiers
420.242	are acting this way.
424.813	We're talking about a tiny minority,
424.813	but they have to be brought to justice.
429.058	These clips, and others like them,
431.311	forced the army and the police
431.311	to start investigations.
434.709	They've been shown in Israel, of course,
436.963	and the Israeli public
436.963	was exposed to them also.
440.039	This project redefined
440.039	the struggle for human rights
443.107	in the occupied territories,
444.708	and we managed to reduce the number 
444.708	of violent attacks in the West Bank.
452.517	The success of this project
452.517	got me thinking
454.716	how I can take the same methodology
454.716	to other places in the world.
458.306	Now, we tend to believe that today,
460.016	with all of the technology,
461.722	the smartphones and the Internet,
463.352	we are able to see and understand
463.352	most of what's happening in the world,
466.748	and people are able to tell their story —
468.897	but it's only partly true.
470.796	Still today, with all
470.796	the technology we have,
473.794	less than half of the world's population
476.202	has access to the Internet,
478.478	and more than three billion people —
481.025	I'm repeating the number —
482.589	three billion people are consuming news
482.589	that is censored by those in power.
490.59	More or less around the same time,
492.419	I'm approached by a great guy
492.419	named Uri Fruchtmann.
495.537	He's a filmmaker and an activist.
497.893	We understood we were
497.893	thinking along the same lines,
500.469	and we decided to establish Videre,
500.469	our organization, together.
506.658	While building the organization in London,
509.522	we've been traveling undercover to places
511.594	where a community 
511.594	was suffering from abuses,
513.781	where mass atrocities were happening,
516.449	and there was a lack of reporting.
519.326	We tried to understand how we can help.
523.121	There were four things that I learned.
525.79	The first thing is that we have to engage
528.25	with communities that are
528.25	living in rural areas,
531.409	where violations are happening
531.409	far from the public eye.
534.814	We need to partner with them,
536.645	and we need to understand which images
536.645	are not making it out there
540.566	and help them to document them.
543.824	The second thing I learned
545.642	is that we have to enable them 
545.642	to film in a safe way.
549.424	Security has to be the priority.
553.803	Where I used to work before,
553.803	in the West Bank,
556.006	one can take a camera out,
557.646	most likely not going to get shot,
560.339	but in places we wanted to work,
561.884	just try to pull a phone out,
561.884	and you're dead — literally dead.
567.094	This is why we decided
568.624	to take the operation undercover
570.568	when necessary,
571.995	and use mostly hidden cameras.
574.026	Unfortunately, I can't show you
574.026	the hidden cameras we're using today —
577.403	for obvious reasons —
578.845	but these are cameras we used before.
581.097	You can buy them off the shelf.
583.187	Today, we're building 
583.187	a custom-made hidden camera,
586.786	like the one that Mary was wearing
588.648	in her dress to film
588.648	the intimidation meeting
590.942	of the ruling political party.
592.954	It's a camera that nobody can see,
594.796	that blends into the environment,
597.745	into the surroundings.
599.824	Now, filming securities go beyond
599.824	using hidden cameras.
603.272	Being secure starts way before
603.272	the activist is turning the camera on.
608.162	To keep our partners safe,
610.214	we work to understand
610.214	the risk of every location
612.966	and of every shot before it's happened,
615.647	building a backup plan
615.647	if something goes wrong,
618.549	and making sure 
618.549	we have everything in place
620.941	before our operations start.
623.892	The third thing I learned
623.892	is the importance of verification.
627.707	You can have an amazing shot of atrocity,
630.311	but if you can't verify it,
630.311	it's worth nothing.
634.079	Recently, like in the ongoing war 
634.079	in Syria or the war in Gaza,
637.562	we've seen images that are staged 
637.562	or brought from a different conflict.
642.875	This misinformation destroyed
642.875	the credibility of the source,
645.828	and it's harmed the credibility of other
645.828	reliable and trustworthy sources.
650.608	We use a variety of ways to make sure
650.608	we can verify the information
654.611	and we can trust the material.
656.559	It starts with vetting the partners,
658.432	understanding who they are,
658.432	and working with them very intensively.
661.645	How do you film a location?
663.78	You film road signs, you film watches,
665.614	you film newspapers.
666.956	We are checking maps, looking at maps,
671.442	double-checking the information,
673.695	and looking also at 
673.695	the metadata of the material.
678.078	Now, the fourth and the most
678.078	important thing I learned
681.197	is how you use images 
681.197	to create a positive change.
686.45	To have an effect,
688.299	the key thing is how you use the material.
692.886	Today, we're working
692.886	with hundreds of activists
695.404	filming undercover.
696.953	We work with them both to understand 
696.953	the situation on the ground
700.055	and which images 
700.055	are missing to describe it,
703.045	who are the ones that are 
703.045	influencing the situation,
707.979	and when to release the material
707.979	to advance the struggle.
712.036	Sometimes, it's about
712.036	putting it in the media,
714.473	mostly local ones, to create awareness.
716.399	Sometimes it's working
716.399	with decision makers,
718.835	to change laws.
720.009	Sometimes, it's working with lawyers
720.009	to use as evidence in court.
724.535	But more than often,
726.053	the most effective way
726.053	to create a social change
730.011	is to work within the community.
732.342	I want to give you one example.
734.575	Fatuma is part of a network of women
734.575	that are fighting abuses in Kenya.
740.351	Women in her community
740.351	have been harassed constantly
743.282	on their way to school
743.282	and on their way to work.
746.157	They are trying to change 
746.157	the behavior of the community from inside.
749.854	In the next clip,
752.384	Fatuma is taking us with her
752.384	on her journey to work.
756.649	Her voice is superimposed
756.649	on images that she filmed herself
760.557	using hidden cameras.
763.095	(Video) Fatuma Chiusiku: 
763.095	My name is Fatuma Chiusiku.
765.572	I'm 32 years old, a mother,
767.824	And Ziwa La Ng'Ombe is my home.
771.439	Each morning, I ride the mini-bus
773.652	Number 11.
776.009	But instead of a peaceful journey to work,
779.062	each day begins with fear.
782.491	Come with me now
783.991	and use my eyes
785.796	to feel what I feel.
791.569	As I walk, I think to myself:
793.714	Will I be touched?
795.385	Grabbed?
796.65	Violated by this conductor again?
800.114	Even the men inside
802.207	the way they look at me
804.35	touch my body, rub against me,
806.666	grab me,
808.619	and now, as I sit in my seat
810.892	I only wish my mind was full
810.892	of thoughts for my day,
813.734	my dreams, my children at school,
815.35	but instead I worry about
815.35	the moment when we will arrive
819.617	and I will be violated again.
824.785	OY: Today, there is a new front
824.785	in the fight for human rights.
830.15	I used to carry a big gun.
832.695	Now, I am carrying this.
835.868	This is a much more powerful
835.868	and much, much more effective weapon.
842.298	But we have to use its power wisely.
846.429	By putting the right images
846.429	in the right hands at the right time,
851.793	we can truly create an impact.
854.585	Thank you.
856.819	(Applause)
865.244	Thank you.
867.848	(Applause)
