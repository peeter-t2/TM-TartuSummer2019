12.8	In the year 1901,
14.64	a woman called Auguste was taken
14.64	to a medical asylum in Frankfurt.
18.96	Auguste was delusional
20.52	and couldn't remember
20.52	even the most basic details of her life.
24.28	Her doctor was called Alois.
27.84	Alois didn't know how to help Auguste,
30.12	but he watched over her until,
30.12	sadly, she passed away in 1906.
34.52	After she died, Alois performed an autopsy
37.28	and found strange plaques
37.28	and tangles in Auguste's brain --
40.52	the likes of which he'd never seen before.
42.88	Now here's the even more striking thing.
46	If Auguste had instead been alive today,
49.52	we could offer her no more help
49.52	than Alois was able to 114 years ago.
56.08	Alois was Dr. Alois Alzheimer.
60.52	And Auguste Deter
62.68	was the first patient to be diagnosed with
62.68	what we now call Alzheimer's disease.
67.68	Since 1901, medicine has advanced greatly.
71.2	We've discovered antibiotics and vaccines
71.2	to protect us from infections,
75.16	many treatments for cancer,
75.16	antiretrovirals for HIV,
79.04	statins for heart disease and much more.
82.896	But we've made essentially no progress
82.896	at all in treating Alzheimer's disease.
90.44	I'm part of a team of scientists
92	who has been working to find
92	a cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade.
95.8	So I think about this all the time.
98.28	Alzheimer's now affects
102.36	But by 2050, it will affect
108.36	which, by the way,
108.36	will include many of you.
113.04	If you're hoping
113.04	to live to be 85 or older,
117.16	your chance of getting Alzheimer's
117.16	will be almost one in two.
123.6	In other words, odds are
123.6	you'll spend your golden years
126.84	either suffering from Alzheimer's
129.08	or helping to look after a friend
129.08	or loved one with Alzheimer's.
134.48	Already in the United States alone,
136.48	Alzheimer's care costs
141.919	One out of every five
141.919	Medicare dollars get spent on Alzheimer's.
146.68	It is today the most expensive disease,
149.84	and costs are projected
149.84	to increase fivefold by 2050,
153.08	as the baby boomer generation ages.
156	It may surprise you that, put simply,
159.4	Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical
159.4	and social challenges of our generation.
164.76	But we've done relatively
164.76	little to address it.
167.96	Today, of the top 10
167.96	causes of death worldwide,
171.88	Alzheimer's is the only one
171.88	we cannot prevent, cure or even slow down.
179.8	We understand less about the science
179.8	of Alzheimer's than other diseases
183.52	because we've invested less time
183.52	and money into researching it.
187.24	The US government
187.24	spends 10 times more every year
191.4	on cancer research than on Alzheimer's
194.4	despite the fact
194.4	that Alzheimer's costs us more
198.12	and causes a similar number
198.12	of deaths each year as cancer.
203.88	The lack of resources
203.88	stems from a more fundamental cause:
207.64	a lack of awareness.
210.6	Because here's what few people know
210.6	but everyone should:
215.36	Alzheimer's is a disease,
215.36	and we can cure it.
220.32	For most of the past 114 years,
222.88	everyone, including scientists, mistakenly
222.88	confused Alzheimer's with aging.
228.36	We thought that becoming senile
229.861	was a normal and inevitable
229.861	part of getting old.
233	But we only have to look at a picture
235.04	of a healthy aged brain compared
235.04	to the brain of an Alzheimer's patient
238.92	to see the real physical damage
238.92	caused by this disease.
242.96	As well as triggering severe loss
242.96	of memory and mental abilities,
246.84	the damage to the brain
246.84	caused by Alzheimer's
249.08	significantly reduces life expectancy
249.08	and is always fatal.
254.48	Remember Dr. Alzheimer
254.48	found strange plaques and tangles
257.56	in Auguste's brain a century ago.
260.28	For almost a century,
260.28	we didn't know much about these.
264.24	Today we know they're made
264.24	from protein molecules.
267.64	You can imagine a protein molecule
269.32	as a piece of paper that normally folds
269.32	into an elaborate piece of origami.
274.16	There are spots
274.16	on the paper that are sticky.
276.6	And when it folds correctly,
276.6	these sticky bits end up on the inside.
281.56	But sometimes things go wrong,
281.56	and some sticky bits are on the outside.
286.04	This causes the protein molecules
286.04	to stick to each other,
289.08	forming clumps that eventually become
289.08	large plaques and tangles.
293.68	That's what we see
293.68	in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.
297.24	We've spent the past 10 years
297.24	at the University of Cambridge
300.36	trying to understand
300.36	how this malfunction works.
303.8	There are many steps, and identifying
303.8	which step to try to block is complex --
308.52	like defusing a bomb.
310.6	Cutting one wire might do nothing.
312.72	Cutting others might
312.72	make the bomb explore.
316.16	We have to find the right step to block,
318.36	and then create a drug that does it.
321	Until recently, we for the most part
323.08	have been cutting wires
323.08	and hoping for the best.
325.56	But now we've got together
325.56	a diverse group of people --
328.44	medics, biologists, geneticists, chemists,
328.44	physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
334.04	And together, we've managed
334.04	to identify a critical step in the process
338.28	and are now testing a new class of drugs
338.28	which would specifically block this step
342.52	and stop the disease.
344.36	Now let me show you
344.36	some of our latest results.
346.88	No one outside of our lab
346.88	has seen these yet.
349.56	Let's look at some videos of what happened
349.56	when we tested these new drugs in worms.
354.56	So these are healthy worms,
356.44	and you can see
356.44	they're moving around normally.
359.56	These worms, on the other hand,
362.48	have protein molecules
362.48	sticking together inside them --
365.6	like humans with Alzheimer's.
367.24	And you can see they're clearly sick.
369.56	But if we give our new drugs
369.56	to these worms at an early stage,
374.56	then we see that they're healthy,
374.56	and they live a normal lifespan.
379.2	This is just an initial positive result,
379.2	but research like this
382.88	shows us that Alzheimer's is a disease
382.88	that we can understand and we can cure.
387.64	After 114 years of waiting,
390.56	there's finally real hope
390.56	for what can be achieved
392.96	in the next 10 or 20 years.
396.04	But to grow that hope,
396.04	to finally beat Alzheimer's, we need help.
400.92	This isn't about scientists like me --
402.8	it's about you.
404.6	We need you to raise awareness
404.6	that Alzheimer's is a disease
408.2	and that if we try, we can beat it.
410.84	In the case of other diseases,
412.68	patients and their families
412.68	have led the charge for more research
415.84	and put pressure on governments,
415.84	the pharmaceutical industry,
418.8	scientists and regulators.
421.04	That was essential for advancing treatment
421.04	for HIV in the late 1980s.
425.92	Today, we see that same drive
425.92	to beat cancer.
430.32	But Alzheimer's patients are often
430.32	unable to speak up for themselves.
434.68	And their families, the hidden victims,
434.68	caring for their loved ones night and day,
439.44	are often too worn out
439.44	to go out and advocate for change.
443.32	So, it really is down to you.
447.72	Alzheimer's isn't,
447.72	for the most part, a genetic disease.
451.08	Everyone with a brain is at risk.
454.16	Today, there are 40 million
454.16	patients like Auguste,
458.68	who can't create the change
458.68	they need for themselves.
461.6	Help speak up for them,
464.08	and help demand a cure.
467.346	Thank you.
468.52	(Applause)
