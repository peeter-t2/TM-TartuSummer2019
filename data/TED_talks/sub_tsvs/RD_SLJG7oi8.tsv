12.613	I want to give you a new perspective.
15.82	That sounds grandiose, and it is.
19.38	I left Ireland yesterday morning.
21.7	I traveled from Dublin to New York
24.18	independently.
25.9	But the design of an airport,
27.82	plane and terminal
30.38	offers little independence when
30.38	you're 105 and a half centimeters tall.
35.02	"For Americans, that's 3' 5""."
39.5	I was whisked through the airport
39.5	by airline assistants in a wheelchair.
43.82	Now, I don't need to use a wheelchair,
47.5	but the design of an airport
49.62	and its lack of accessibility
51.9	means that it's my only way
51.9	to get through.
55.1	With my carry-on bag between my feet,
57.86	I was wheeled through
57.86	security, preclearance
61.26	and I arrived at my boarding gate.
64.7	I use the accessibility
64.7	services in the airport
67.58	because most of the terminal
67.58	is just not designed with me in mind.
71.74	Take security, for example.
74.14	I'm not strong enough
74.14	to lift my carry-on bag
77.26	from the ground to the carousel.
80.3	I stand at eye level with it.
82.38	And those who work in that space
82.38	for safety purposes cannot help me
87.34	and cannot do it for me.
90.02	Design inhibits my autonomy
90.02	and my independence.
94.82	But traveling at this size,
94.82	it isn't all bad.
98.78	The leg room in economy
98.78	is like business class.
101.58	(Laughter)
104.58	I often forget that I'm a little person.
107.18	It's the physical environment
107.18	and society that remind me.
111.94	Using a public bathroom
111.94	is an excruciating experience.
116.7	I walk into the cubicle
118.9	but I can't reach the lock on the door.
121.7	I'm creative and resilient.
124.82	I look around and see if there's
124.82	a bin that I can turn upside down.
129.22	Is it safe?
130.86	Not really.
132.46	Is it hygienic and sanitary?
135.26	Definitely not.
137.58	But the alternative is much worse.
140.06	If that doesn't work, I use my phone.
142.98	It gives me an additional
142.98	four- to six-inch reach,
146.06	and I try to jam the lock closed
146.06	with my iPhone.
149.54	Now, I imagine that's not what Jony Ive
149.54	had in mind when he designed the iPhone,
153.98	but it works.
156.78	The alternative
156.78	is that I approach a stranger.
160.3	I apologize profusely
162.58	and I ask them to stand guard
162.58	outside my cubicle door.
166.82	They do
168.38	and I emerge grateful
171.3	but absolutely mortified,
173.86	and hope that they didn't notice
175.62	that I left the bathroom
175.62	without washing my hands.
179.02	I carry hand sanitizer with me
179.02	every single day
183.06	because the sink, soap dispenser,
183.06	hand dryer and mirror
188.42	are all out of my reach.
190.94	Now, the accessible bathroom
190.94	is somewhat of an option.
193.7	In this space, I can reach
193.7	the lock on the door,
196.66	the sink, the soap dispenser,
196.66	the hand dryer and the mirror.
202.22	Yet, I cannot use the toilet.
206.34	It is deliberately designed higher
208.82	so that wheelchair users
208.82	can transfer across with ease.
213.02	This is a wonderful
213.02	and necessary innovation,
217.26	but in the design world, when we describe
217.26	a new project or idea as accessible,
222.5	what does that mean?
224.74	Who is it accessible to?
227.66	And whose needs
227.66	are not being accommodated for?
231.82	Now, the bathroom is an example
233.34	of where design impinges upon my dignity,
236.74	but the physical environment impacts
236.74	upon me in much more casual ways too,
241.06	something as simple
241.06	as ordering a cup of coffee.
244.14	Now, I'll admit it.
245.98	I drink far too much coffee.
248.3	My order is a skinny vanilla latte,
250.9	but I'm trying
250.9	to wean myself off the syrup.
254.62	But the coffee shop,
254.62	it's not designed well,
257.38	at least not for me.
259.34	Queuing, I'm standing
259.34	beside the pastry cabinet
262.14	and the barista calls for the next order.
265.02	"""Next, please!"" they shout."
268.26	They can't see me.
270.46	The person next to me in the queue
270.46	points to my existence
273.3	and everyone is embarrassed.
276.06	I order as quick as I can
276.06	and I move along to collect my coffee.
280.3	Now, think just for a second.
283.38	Where do they put it?
285.78	Up high and without a lid.
288.3	Reaching up to collect a coffee
288.3	that I have paid for
291.22	is an incredibly dangerous experience.
294.46	But design also impinges
294.46	on the clothes that I want to wear.
297.74	I want garments
297.74	that reflect my personality.
301.14	It's difficult to find
301.14	in the childrenswear department.
304.46	And often womenswear
304.46	requires far too many alterations.
308.42	I want shoes that affect my maturity,
308.42	professionalism and sophistication.
313.98	Instead, I'm offered sneakers
313.98	with Velcro straps and light-up shoes.
319.02	Now, I'm not totally opposed
319.02	to light-up shoes.
322.82	(Laughter)
324.9	But design also impacts
324.9	on such simple things,
328.34	like sitting on a chair.
330.74	I cannot go from a standing
330.74	to a seating position with grace.
335.14	Due to the standards
335.14	of design heights of chairs,
338.42	I have to crawl on my hands and knees
341.14	just to get on top of it,
342.78	whilst also being conscious
342.78	that it might tip over at any stage.
347.94	But whilst design impacts on me
349.78	whether it's a chair,
349.78	a bathroom, a coffee shop, or clothes,
354.58	I rely on and benefit
357.78	from the kindness of strangers.
361.34	But not everybody is so nice.
364.22	I'm reminded that I'm a little person
366.82	when a stranger points,
369.34	stares,
371.14	laughs,
373.18	calls me a name,
374.98	or takes a photograph of me.
377.78	This happens almost every day.
380.54	With the rise of social media,
380.54	it has given me an opportunity
383.46	and a platform to have a voice
383.46	as a blogger and as an activist,
388.26	but it has also made me nervous
390.58	that I might become a meme
392.7	or a viral sensation,
395.22	all without my consent.
398.06	So let's take a moment right now
400.78	to make something very clear.
403.54	"The word ""midget"" is a slur."
407.18	It evolved from PT Barnum's era
407.18	of circuses and freak shows.
412.46	Society has evolved.
415.34	So should our vocabulary.
417.66	Language is a powerful tool.
420.06	It does not just name our society.
422.54	It shapes it.
424.7	I am incredibly proud
424.7	to be a little person,
428.14	to have inherited
428.14	the condition of achondroplasia.
431.42	But I am most proud to be Sinead.
434.5	Achondroplasia is
434.5	the most common form of dwarfism.
438.22	Achondroplasia translates
438.22	"as ""without cartilage formation."""
442.58	I have short limbs
442.58	and achondroplastic facial features,
446.34	my forehead and my nose.
449.38	My arms do not straighten fully,
452.02	but I can lick my elbow.
454.46	I'm not showing you that one.
457.02	Achondroplasia occurs in approximately
457.02	one in every 20,000 births.
	are born to two average-height parents.
466.82	That means that anybody in this room
466.82	could have a child with achondroplasia.
471.78	Yet, I inherited my condition from my dad.
475.7	I'd like to show you a photo of my family.
479.1	My mother is average height,
481.14	my father is a little person
483.38	and I am the eldest of five children.
486.02	I have three sisters and one brother.
489.38	They are all average height.
491.98	I am incredibly fortunate
491.98	to have been born into a family
495.42	that cultivated
495.42	my curiosity and my tenacity,
499.54	that protected me from the unkindness
499.54	and ignorance of strangers
504.54	and that armed me with the resilience,
504.54	creativity and confidence
508.74	that I needed to survive and manipulate
508.74	the physical environment and society.
514.62	If I was to pinpoint any reason
514.62	why I am successful,
518.46	it is because I was
518.46	and I am a loved child,
523.38	now, a loved child
523.38	with a lot of sass and sarcasm,
527.3	but a loved child nonetheless.
530.18	In giving you an insight
530.18	into who I am today
534.1	I wanted to offer you a new perspective.
537.02	I wanted to challenge the idea
538.5	that design is but a tool
538.5	to create function and beauty.
543.1	Design greatly impacts
543.1	upon people's lives,
547.22	all lives.
549.18	Design is a way in which
549.18	we can feel included in the world,
552.9	but it is also a way in which
552.9	we can uphold a person's dignity
557.18	and their human rights.
559.42	Design can also inflict vulnerability
562.14	on a group whose needs aren't considered.
566.14	So today, I want
566.14	your perceptions challenged.
570.7	Who are we not designing for?
572.82	How can we amplify their voices
575.66	and their experiences?
578.02	What is the next step?
580.22	Design is an enormous privilege,
582.82	but it is a bigger responsibility.
585.78	I want you to open your eyes.
588.58	Thank you so much.
589.82	(Applause)
