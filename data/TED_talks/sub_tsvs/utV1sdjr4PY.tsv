12.564	My job is to design, build and study
12.564	robots that communicate with people.
17.231	But this story doesn't start with robotics
17.231	at all, it starts with animation.
20.874	"When I first saw Pixar's ""Luxo Jr.,"""
23.267	I was amazed by how much
23.267	emotion they could put
25.997	into something as trivial as a desk lamp.
29.477	I mean, look at them --
29.477	at the end of this movie,
31.846	you actually feel something
31.846	for two pieces of furniture.
34.649	(Laughter)
35.954	And I said, I have
35.954	to learn how to do this.
38.006	So I made a really bad career decision.
40.257	(Laughter)
41.475	And that's what my mom
41.475	was like when I did it.
43.692	(Laughter)
45.857	I left a very cozy tech job in Israel
45.857	at a nice software company
49.302	and I moved to New York
49.302	to study animation.
51.618	And there I lived
52.793	in a collapsing apartment building
52.793	in Harlem with roommates.
55.635	I'm not using this phrase
55.635	metaphorically --
57.683	the ceiling actually collapsed
57.683	one day in our living room.
60.436	Whenever they did news stories
60.436	about building violations in New York,
63.702	they would put the report
63.702	in front of our building,
66.142	as kind of, like, a backdrop
66.142	to show how bad things are.
68.903	Anyway, during the day, I went to school
70.864	and at night I would sit and draw
70.864	frame by frame of pencil animation.
74.315	And I learned two surprising lessons.
76.524	One of them was that
76.524	when you want to arouse emotions,
81.038	it doesn't matter so much
81.038	how something looks;
83.237	it's all in the motion, in the timing
83.237	of how the thing moves.
86.816	And the second was something
86.816	one of our teachers told us.
90.03	"He actually did the weasel in ""Ice Age."""
92.662	"And he said, ""As an animator,"
92.662	"you're not a director -- you're an actor."""
96.895	So, if you want to find
96.895	the right motion for a character,
99.942	don't think about it --
99.942	go use your body to find it.
102.411	Stand in front of a mirror,
102.411	act it out in front of a camera --
105.368	whatever you need -- and then
105.368	put it back in your character.
108.696	A year later I found myself at MIT
108.696	in the Robotic Life Group.
111.932	It was one of the first groups
111.932	researching the relationships
114.814	between humans and robots.
116.152	And I still had this dream
116.152	to make an actual, physical Luxo Jr. lamp.
120.132	But I found that robots didn't move
120.132	at all in this engaging way
123.148	that I was used to
123.148	from my animation studies.
125.347	Instead, they were all --
125.347	how should I put it --
127.835	they were all kind of robotic.
129.313	(Laughter)
131.211	And I thought, what if I took
131.211	whatever I learned in animation school,
134.971	and used that to design
134.971	my robotic desk lamp.
137.598	So I went and designed frame by frame
139.667	to try to make this robot as graceful
139.667	and engaging as possible.
144.199	And here when you see the robot
144.199	interacting with me on a desktop --
147.932	and I'm actually redesigning the robot,
149.992	so, unbeknownst to itself,
151.82	it's kind of digging its own
151.82	grave by helping me.
154.419	(Laughter)
156.449	I wanted it to be less of a mechanical
156.449	structure giving me light,
159.712	and more of a helpful,
159.712	kind of quiet apprentice
162.754	that's always there when you need it
162.754	and doesn't really interfere.
165.947	And when, for example, I'm looking
165.947	for a battery that I can't find,
169.306	in a subtle way, it'll show me
169.306	where the battery is.
173.872	So you can see my confusion here.
176.442	I'm not an actor.
180.585	And I want you to notice
180.585	how the same mechanical structure
183.642	can, at one point,
183.642	just by the way it moves,
185.753	seem gentle and caring
185.753	and in the other case,
187.921	seem violent and confrontational.
190.316	And it's the same structure,
190.316	just the motion is different.
199.419	"Actor: ""You want to know something?"
199.419	Well, you want to know something?
204.015	He was already dead!
205.928	"Just laying there, eyes glazed over!"""
209.854	(Laughter)
210.899	But, moving in a graceful way
210.899	is just one building block
213.979	of this whole structure
213.979	called human-robot interaction.
216.598	I was, at the time, doing my PhD,
216.598	I was working on human-robot teamwork,
220.075	teams of humans and robots
220.075	working together.
222.161	I was studying the engineering,
223.82	the psychology,
223.82	the philosophy of teamwork,
226.376	and at the same time,
227.551	I found myself in my own kind
227.551	of teamwork situation,
230.069	with a good friend of mine,
230.069	who's actually here.
232.345	And in that situation,
232.345	we can easily imagine robots
234.773	in the near future being there with us.
236.697	It was after a Passover Seder.
238.411	We were folding up
238.411	a lot of folding chairs,
240.49	and I was amazed at how quickly
240.49	we found our own rhythm.
243.172	Everybody did their own part,
243.172	we didn't have to divide our tasks.
246.306	We didn't have to communicate
246.306	verbally about this --
248.776	it all just happened.
249.989	And I thought, humans and robots
249.989	don't look at all like this.
252.893	When humans and robots interact,
252.893	it's much more like a chess game:
256.048	the human does a thing, the robot
256.048	analyzes whatever the human did,
259.193	the robot decides what to do next,
259.193	plans it and does it.
261.86	Then the human waits,
261.86	until it's their turn again.
264.239	So it's much more like a chess game,
264.239	and that makes sense,
266.994	because chess is great for mathematicians
266.994	and computer scientists.
270.129	It's all about information, analysis,
270.129	decision-making and planning.
273.581	But I wanted my robot
273.581	to be less of a chess player,
277.335	and more like a doer
279.152	that just clicks and works together.
281.177	So I made my second
281.177	horrible career choice:
284.57	I decided to study acting for a semester.
287.147	I took off from the PhD,
287.147	I went to acting classes.
290.09	I actually participated in a play --
292.152	I hope thereâ€™s no video
292.152	of that around still.
294.478	(Laughter)
295.54	And I got every book
295.54	I could find about acting,
297.858	including one from the 19th century
297.858	that I got from the library.
301.011	And I was really amazed, because my name
301.011	was the second name on the list --
304.648	the previous name was in 1889.
306.672	(Laughter)
307.711	And this book was
307.711	kind of waiting for 100 years
309.984	to be rediscovered for robotics.
312.34	And this book shows actors
313.94	how to move every muscle in the body
316.202	to match every kind of emotion
316.202	that they want to express.
318.942	But the real revelation was
318.942	when I learned about method acting.
321.992	It became very popular
321.992	in the 20th century.
324.269	And method acting said
325.444	you don't have to plan
325.444	every muscle in your body;
327.768	instead, you have to use your body
327.768	to find the right movement.
330.737	You have to use your sense memory
330.737	to reconstruct the emotions
333.641	and kind of think with your body
333.641	to find the right expression --
336.703	improvise, play off your scene partner.
338.602	And this came at the same time
340.071	as I was reading about this trend
340.071	in cognitive psychology,
343.201	called embodied cognition,
343.201	which also talks about the same ideas.
346.477	We use our bodies to think;
348.016	we don't just think with our brains
348.016	and use our bodies to move,
350.997	but our bodies feed back into our brain
352.939	to generate the way that we behave.
355.128	And it was like a lightning bolt.
356.748	I went back to my office,
357.986	I wrote this paper,
357.986	which I never really published,
360.415	"called ""Acting Lessons"
360.415	"for Artificial Intelligence."""
362.971	And I even took another month
364.376	to do what was then the first theater play
366.844	with a human and a robot acting together.
368.821	That's what you saw
368.821	before with the actors.
372.564	And I thought:
373.739	How can we make an artificial
373.739	intelligence model --
376.7	a computer, computational model --
378.707	that will model some of these
378.707	ideas of improvisation,
381.238	of taking risks, of taking chances,
383.092	even of making mistakes?
384.643	Maybe it can make for better
384.643	robotic teammates.
387.28	So I worked for quite
387.28	a long time on these models
389.908	and I implemented them
389.908	on a number of robots.
392.327	Here you can see a very early example
394.652	with the robots trying to use
394.652	this embodied artificial intelligence
398.255	to try to match my movements
398.255	as closely as possible.
400.742	It's sort of like a game.
402.53	Let's look at it.
407.652	You can see when I psych
407.652	it out, it gets fooled.
411.698	And it's a little bit
411.698	like what you might see actors do
414.317	when they try to mirror each other
415.975	to find the right synchrony between them.
418.364	And then, I did another experiment,
420.22	and I got people off the street
420.22	to use the robotic desk lamp,
424.303	and try out this idea
424.303	of embodied artificial intelligence.
427.921	So, I actually used two kinds
427.921	of brains for the same robot.
432.543	The robot is the same lamp that you saw,
434.519	and I put two brains in it.
435.882	For one half of the people,
437.633	I put in a brain
437.633	that's kind of the traditional,
440.593	calculated robotic brain.
441.846	It waits for its turn,
441.846	it analyzes everything, it plans.
444.51	Let's call it the calculated brain.
446.216	The other got more the stage
446.216	actor, risk-taker brain.
449.487	Let's call it the adventurous brain.
451.633	It sometimes acts without knowing
451.633	everything it has to know.
454.594	It sometimes makes mistakes
454.594	and corrects them.
456.91	And I had them do this very tedious task
456.91	that took almost 20 minutes,
460.852	and they had to work together,
462.352	somehow simulating, like, a factory job
464.929	of repetitively doing the same thing.
467.445	What I found is that people
467.445	actually loved the adventurous robot.
470.8	They thought it was more intelligent,
472.601	more committed,
472.601	a better member of the team,
474.731	contributed to the success
474.731	of the team more.
476.82	"They even called it ""he"" and ""she,"""
478.552	whereas people with the calculated brain
480.697	"called it ""it,"" and nobody"
480.697	"ever called it ""he"" or ""she."""
483.876	When they talked about it after the task,
483.876	with the adventurous brain,
487.193	"they said, ""By the end, we were good"
487.193	"friends and high-fived mentally."""
491.397	Whatever that means.
492.714	(Laughter)
494.644	Sounds painful.
496.021	Whereas the people
496.021	with the calculated brain
498.783	said it was just like a lazy apprentice.
501.165	It only did what it was supposed
501.165	to do and nothing more,
503.934	which is almost what people
503.934	expect robots to do,
506.307	so I was surprised that people
506.307	had higher expectations of robots
509.886	than what anybody in robotics
509.886	thought robots should be doing.
514.027	And in a way, I thought,
514.027	maybe it's time --
516.066	just like method acting
516.066	changed the way people thought
519.052	about acting in the 19th century,
520.672	from going from the very calculated,
520.672	planned way of behaving,
523.773	to a more intuitive, risk-taking,
523.773	embodied way of behaving --
527.295	maybe it's time for robots
527.295	to have the same kind of revolution.
531.994	A few years later, I was at my next
531.994	research job at Georgia Tech in Atlanta,
535.617	and I was working in a group
535.617	dealing with robotic musicians.
538.465	And I thought, music:
538.465	that's the perfect place
540.849	to look at teamwork, coordination,
540.849	timing, improvisation --
545.016	and we just got this robot
545.016	playing marimba.
547.483	And the marimba, for everybody like me,
549.763	it was this huge, wooden xylophone.
552.526	And when I was looking at this,
554.613	I looked at other works
554.613	in human-robot improvisation --
557.635	yes, there are other works
557.635	in human-robot improvisation --
560.406	and they were also a little bit
560.406	like a chess game.
562.779	The human would play,
563.954	the robot analyzed what was played,
566.151	and would improvise their own part.
568.254	So, this is what musicians called
568.254	a call-and-response interaction,
571.416	and it also fits very well
571.416	robots and artificial intelligence.
575.187	But I thought, if I use the same ideas
575.187	I used in the theater play
578.464	and in the teamwork studies,
580.232	maybe I can make the robots
580.232	jam together like a band.
583.906	Everybody's riffing off each other,
583.906	nobody is stopping for a moment.
588.198	And so I tried to do the same
588.198	things, this time with music,
591.096	where the robot doesn't really know
591.096	what it's about to play,
593.954	it just sort of moves its body
593.954	and uses opportunities to play,
596.995	and does what my jazz teacher
596.995	when I was 17 taught me.
599.558	She said, when you improvise,
600.979	sometimes you don't know
600.979	what you're doing, and you still do it.
604.019	So I tried to make a robot that doesn't
604.019	actually know what it's doing,
607.369	but is still doing it.
608.614	So let's look at a few seconds
608.614	from this performance,
611.149	where the robot listens
611.149	to the human musician
613.3	and improvises.
614.489	And then, look how the human
614.489	musician also responds
617.488	to what the robot is doing
618.785	and picking up from its behavior,
621.453	and at some point can even be surprised
621.453	by what the robot came up with.
625.433	(Music)
667.618	(Music ends)
671.134	(Applause)
676.892	Being a musician
676.892	is not just about making notes,
679.166	otherwise nobody
679.166	would ever go see a live show.
681.538	Musicians also communicate
681.538	with their bodies,
683.684	with other band members,
683.684	with the audience,
685.725	they use their bodies
685.725	to express the music.
687.763	And I thought, we already have
687.763	a robot musician on stage,
690.484	why not make it be
690.484	a full-fledged musician?
692.82	And I started designing
692.82	a socially expressive head
695.518	for the robot.
696.885	The head doesnâ€™t actually
696.885	touch the marimba,
698.979	it just expresses what the music is like.
700.962	These are some napkin sketches
700.962	from a bar in Atlanta
703.482	that was dangerously
703.482	located exactly halfway
706.049	between my lab and my home.
707.884	So I spent, I would say, on average,
707.884	three to four hours a day there.
711.846	I think.
713.057	(Laughter)
714.917	And I went back to my animation
714.917	tools and tried to figure out
717.823	not just what a robotic
717.823	musician would look like,
720.217	but especially what a robotic
720.217	musician would move like,
722.866	to sort of show that it doesn't like
722.866	what the other person is playing --
726.292	and maybe show whatever beat
726.292	it's feeling at the moment.
730.141	So we ended up actually getting the money
730.141	to build this robot, which was nice.
734.668	I'm going to show you now
734.668	the same kind of performance,
737.296	this time with a socially expressive head.
739.36	And notice one thing --
741.184	how the robot is really showing us
742.879	the beat it's picking up from the human,
744.809	while also giving the human a sense
744.809	that the robot knows what it's doing.
748.76	And also how it changes the way it moves
750.704	as soon as it starts its own solo.
752.68	(Music)
756.6	Now it's looking at me,
756.6	showing that it's listening.
759.644	(Music)
781.181	Now look at the final chord
781.181	of the piece again.
784.126	And this time the robot
784.126	communicates with its body
787.067	when it's busy doing its own thing,
789.204	and when it's ready to coordinate
789.204	the final chord with me.
794.079	(Music)
801.783	(Music ending)
806.103	(Final chord)
807.128	(Applause)
812.906	Thanks.
814.085	I hope you see
815.69	how much this part of the body
815.69	that doesn't touch the instrument
820.11	actually helps
820.11	with the musical performance.
823.16	And at some point -- we are in Atlanta,
825.193	so obviously some rapper
825.193	will come into our lab at some point --
828.467	and we had this rapper come in and do
828.467	a little jam with the robot.
833.284	Here you can see the robot
833.284	basically responding to the beat.
837.356	Notice two things:
838.531	one, how irresistible it is to join
838.531	the robot while it's moving its head.
842.164	You kind of want to move
842.164	your own head when it does it.
844.791	And second, even though the rapper
844.791	is really focused on his iPhone,
848.401	as soon as the robot turns
848.401	to him, he turns back.
851.535	So even though it's just
851.535	in the periphery of his vision,
854.195	in the corner of his eye,
854.195	it's very powerful.
856.339	And the reason is that we can't ignore
858.197	physical things moving in our environment.
860.245	We are wired for that.
861.439	So if you have a problem --
863.107	maybe your partner is looking
863.107	at their iPhone or smartphone too much --
867.806	you might want to have a robot
867.806	there to get their attention.
870.664	(Laughter)
871.689	(Music)
886.113	(Music ends)
890.138	(Applause)
897.633	Just to introduce the last robot
897.633	that we've worked on,
901.491	it came out of something
901.491	surprising that we found:
903.865	Some point people didn't care
903.865	about the robot being intelligent,
907.047	able to improvise and listen,
908.473	and do all these embodied intelligence
908.473	things that I spent years developing.
912.903	They really liked that the robot
912.903	was enjoying the music.
915.608	(Laughter)
916.633	And they didn't say the robot
916.633	was moving to the music,
919.202	"they said ""enjoying"" the music."
920.714	And we thought,
920.714	why don't we take this idea,
922.864	and I designed a new piece of furniture.
925.629	This time it wasn't a desk lamp,
925.629	it was a speaker dock,
928.225	one of those things
928.225	you plug your smartphone in.
930.889	And I thought,
932.063	what would happen if your speaker dock
932.063	didn't just play the music for you,
935.587	but would actually enjoy it, too?
937.657	And so again, here are some
937.657	animation tests from an early stage.
941.842	(Laughter)
943.835	And this is what the final
943.835	product looked like.
958.247	(Music)
978.848	(Music ends)
981.461	So, a lot of bobbing heads.
984.105	(Applause)
987.74	A lot of bobbing heads in the audience,
989.654	so we can still see
989.654	robots influence people.
992.386	And it's not just fun and games.
995.195	I think one of the reasons I care so much
997.42	about robots that use
997.42	their body to communicate
999.677	and use their body to move is --
1001.407	I'm going to let you in on a little
1001.407	secret we roboticists are hiding --
1004.821	is that every one of you
1004.821	is going to be living with a robot
1007.638	at some point in your life.
1009.254	Somewhere in your future,
1009.254	there will be a robot in your life.
1012.211	If not in yours, your children's lives.
1014.103	And I want these robots to be more fluent,
1014.103	more engaging, more graceful
1019.117	than currently they seem to be.
1020.87	And for that I think maybe robots
1020.87	need to be less like chess players
1024.181	and more like stage actors
1024.181	and more like musicians.
1026.846	Maybe they should be able
1026.846	to take chances and improvise.
1029.683	Maybe they should be able
1029.683	to anticipate what you're about to do.
1032.731	Maybe they even need to be able
1032.731	to make mistakes and correct them,
1036.103	because in the end, we are human.
1038.015	And maybe as humans,
1038.015	robots that are a little less than perfect
1041.593	are just perfect for us.
1043.348	Thank you.
1044.531	(Applause)
