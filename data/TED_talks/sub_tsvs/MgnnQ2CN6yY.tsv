12.751	This summer I was back
12.751	in Ohio for a family wedding,
19.784	and when I was there,
21.985	there was a meet and greet
21.985	"with Anna and Elsa from ""Frozen."""
25.478	"Not the Anna and Elsa from ""Frozen,"""
29.103	as this was not a Disney-sanctioned event.
31.833	These two entrepreneurs had
31.833	a business of running princess parties.
36.433	Your kid is turning five?
38.017	They'll come sing some songs,
38.017	sprinkle some fairy dust, it's great.
41.554	And they were not about
41.554	to miss out on the opportunity
45.168	that was the phenomenon
45.168	"and that was ""Frozen."""
47.804	So they get hired by a local toy store,
49.701	kids come in on a Saturday morning,
51.458	buy some Disney swag, get their
51.458	picture taken with the princesses,
54.557	call it a day.
56.16	It's like Santa Claus
56.16	without the seasonal restrictions.
58.857	(Laughter)
60.463	And my three-and-a-half-year-old niece
60.463	Samantha was in the thick of it.
65.55	She could care less that these two women
65.55	were signing posters and coloring books
70.672	as Snow Queen and Princess Ana
70.672	with one N to avoid copyright lawsuits.
75.956	(Laughter)
77.123	According to my niece and the 200-plus
77.123	kids in the parking lot that day,
81.819	"this was the Anna and Elsa from ""Frozen."""
87.955	It is a blazing hot Saturday morning
87.955	in August in Ohio.
93.598	We get there at 10 o'clock,
93.598	the scheduled start time,
96.873	and we are handed number 59.
99.106	By 11 o'clock they had called
99.106	numbers 21 through 25;
103.674	this was going to be a while,
105.427	and there is no amount
105.427	of free face painting or temporary tattoos
109.892	that could prevent the meltdowns
109.892	that were occurring outside of the store.
113.397	(Laughter)
114.972	So, by 12:30 we get called:
119.114	"""56 to 63, please."""
122.316	And as we walk in, it is a scene
122.316	I can only describe you
125.678	as saying it looked like Norway threw up.
128.568	(Laughter)
129.948	There were cardboard
129.948	cut-out snowflakes covering the floor,
134.334	glitter on every flat surface,
134.334	and icicles all over the walls.
139.87	And as we stood in line
141.063	in an attempt to give
141.063	my niece a better vantage point
143.596	than the backside
143.596	of the mother of number 58,
146.151	I put her up on my shoulders,
147.88	and she was instantly riveted
147.88	by the sight of the princesses.
151.979	And as we moved forward,
151.979	her excitement only grew,
154.52	and as we finally got
154.52	to the front of the line,
156.804	and number 58 unfurled her poster
156.804	to be signed by the princesses,
160.498	I could literally feel the excitement
160.498	running through her body.
164.098	And let's be honest,
164.098	at that point, I was pretty excited too.
167.063	(Laughter)
168.458	I mean, the Scandinavian decadence
168.458	was mesmerizing.
171.457	(Laughter)
172.626	So we get to the front of the line,
174.536	and the haggard clerk
174.536	turns to my niece and says,
177.546	"""Hi, honey. You're next!"
179.366	Do you want to get down,
179.366	or you're going to stay
181.656	on your dad's shoulders for the picture?'
183.913	(Laughter)
185.4	And I was, for a lack
185.4	of a better word, frozen.
189.262	(Laughter)
190.874	It's amazing that in an unexpected instant
190.874	we are faced with the question,
195.667	who am I?
196.998	Am I an aunt? Or am I an advocate?
200.466	Millions of people have seen my video
200.466	about how to have a hard conversation,
204.297	and there one was, right in front of me.
206.614	At the same time,
207.686	there's nothing more important
207.686	to me than the kids in my life,
210.596	so I found myself in a situation
210.596	that we so often find ourselves in,
214.544	torn between two things,
214.544	two impossible choices.
217.767	Would I be an advocate?
219.794	Would I take my niece off my shoulders
219.794	and turn to the clerk and explain to her
224.342	that I was in fact
224.342	her aunt, not her father,
227.48	and that she should be more careful
229.849	and not to jump to gender conclusions
229.849	based on haircuts and shoulder rides --
234.605	(Laughter) --
235.741	and while doing that,
237.598	miss out on what was, to this point,
237.598	the greatest moment of my niece's life.
243.116	Or would I be an aunt?
245.206	Would I brush off that comment,
245.206	take a million pictures,
248.344	and not be distracted for an instant
248.344	from the pure joy of that moment,
253.322	and by doing that,
254.841	walk out with the shame that comes up
254.841	for not standing up for myself,
258.224	especially in front of my niece.
260.607	Who was I?
262.41	Which one was more important?
262.41	Which role was more worth it?
267.23	Was I an aunt? Or was I an advocate?
270.219	And I had a split second to decide.
274.235	We are taught right now
275.814	that we are living in a world
275.814	of constant and increasing polarity.
280.113	It's so black and white,
280.113	so us and them, so right and wrong.
285.524	There is no middle,
285.524	there is no gray, just polarity.
289.691	Polarity is a state in which
289.691	two ideas or opinions
292.132	are completely opposite from each other;
294.712	a diametrical opposition.
298.127	Which side are you on?
300.581	Are you unequivocally and without question
300.581	antiwar, pro-choice, anti-death penalty,
304.646	pro-gun regulation, proponent
304.646	of open borders and pro-union?
308.104	Or, are you absolutely 
308.104	and uncompromisingly
313.337	pro-war, pro-life, pro-death penalty,
315.522	a believer that the Second
315.522	Amendment is absolute,
317.838	anti-immigrant and pro-business?
319.542	It's all or none, you're with us
319.542	or against us.
321.787	That is polarity.
324.247	The problem with polarity 
324.247	and absolutes is that
329.191	it eliminates the individuality
329.191	of our human experience
334.355	and that makes it contradictory
334.355	to our human nature.
339.187	But if we are pulled
339.187	in these two directions,
341.297	but it's not really where we exist --
343.077	polarity is not our actual reality --
345.507	where do we go from there?
346.887	What's at the other end of that spectrum?
350.368	I don't think it's an unattainable,
350.368	harmonious utopia,
354.408	I think the opposite
354.408	of polarity is duality.
357.842	Duality is a state of having two parts,
360.446	but not in diametrical opposition,
363.73	in simultaneous existence.
366.676	Don't think it's possible?
368.663	Here are the people I know:
370.334	I know Catholics who are pro-choice,
370.334	and feminists who wear hijabs,
373.497	and veterans who are antiwar,
375.202	and NRA members who think
375.202	I should be able to get married.
377.987	Those are the people I know,
377.987	those are my friends and family,
381.023	that is the majority of our society,
381.023	that is you, that is me.
384	(Applause)
392.717	Duality is the ability
392.717	to hold both things.
397.886	But the question is:
397.886	Can we own our duality?
402.008	Can we have the courage
402.008	to hold both things?
406.23	I work at a restaurant in town,
408.422	I became really good friends
408.422	with the busser.
411.032	I was a server and we had 
411.032	a great relationship,
414.05	we had a really great time together.
415.99	Her Spanish was great
419.609	because she was from Mexico.
421.451	(Laughter)
423.313	That line actually went the other way.
425.747	Her English was limited,
425.747	but significantly better than my Spanish.
431.848	But we were united by our similarities,
435.678	not separated by our differences.
438.578	And we were close, even though
438.578	we came from very different worlds.
441.698	She was from Mexico,
442.838	she left her family behind
442.838	so she could come here
446.169	and afford them a better life back home.
448.166	She was a devout conservative Catholic,
451.106	a believer in traditional family values,
453.826	stereotypical roles of men and women,
455.933	and I was, well, me.
458.728	(Laughter)
460.633	But the things that bonded us
460.633	were when she asked about my girlfriend,
464.319	or she shared pictures that she had
464.319	from her family back home.
467.788	Those were the things
467.788	that brought us together.
470.416	So one day, we were in the back,
472.003	scarfing down food as quickly as we could,
472.003	gathered around a small table,
475.683	during a very rare lull,
477.313	and a new guy
477.313	from the kitchen came over --
479.323	who happened to be her cousin --
480.985	and sat down with all
480.985	the bravado and machismo
483.788	that his 20-year-old body could hold.
485.95	(Laughter)
487.772	And he said to her,
487.772	"[in Spanish] ""Does Ash have a boyfriend?"""
493.904	And she said,
493.904	"[in Spanish] ""No, she has a girlfriend."""
499.386	And he said,
499.386	"[in Spanish] ""A girlfriend?!?"""
502.912	And she set down her fork,
502.912	and locked eyes with him,
506.025	"and said, [in Spanish] ""Yes,"
506.025	"a girlfriend. That is all."""
511.048	And his smug smile quickly dropped
511.048	to one of maternal respect,
515.941	grabbed his plate, walked off,
515.941	went back to work.
519.144	She never made eye contact with me.
521.668	She left, did the same thing --
523.384	it was a 10-second conversation,
523.384	such a short interaction.
526.655	And on paper, she had
526.655	so much more in common with him:
529.191	language, culture, history, family,
529.191	her community was her lifeline here,
534.289	but her moral compass trumped all of that.
538.461	And a little bit later, they were joking
538.461	around in the kitchen in Spanish,
542.124	that had nothing to do with me,
544.025	and that is duality.
546.47	She didn't have to choose some P.C. stance
546.47	on gayness over her heritage.
550.983	She didn't have to choose
550.983	her family over our friendship.
554.134	It wasn't Jesus or Ash.
556.409	(Laughter)
560.556	(Applause)
567.183	Her individual morality
567.183	was so strongly rooted
571.761	that she had the courage
571.761	to hold both things.
575.143	Our moral integrity is our responsibility
578.325	and we must be prepared to defend it
578.325	even when it's not convenient.
582.557	That's what it means to be an ally,
582.557	and if you're going to be an ally,
585.87	you have to be an active ally:
588.158	Ask questions, act when you hear
588.158	something inappropriate,
592.046	actually engage.
594.075	I had a family friend who for years
594.075	used to call my girlfriend my lover.
600.531	Really? Lover?
602.976	So overly sexual,
605.001	so '70s gay porn.
607.047	(Laughter)
611.293	But she was trying, and she asked.
613.789	She could have called her my friend,
615.573	"or my ""friend,"" or my ""special friend"" --"
619.708	(Laughter) --
621.093	or even worse, just not asked at all.
624.059	Believe me, we would rather have you ask.
627.69	I would rather have her say lover,
627.69	than say nothing at all.
632.932	People often say to me,
632.932	"""Well, Ash, I don't care."
635.964	I don't see race
635.964	or religion or sexuality.
639.757	"It doesn't matter to me. I don't see it."""
643.91	But I think the opposite of homophobia
643.91	and racism and xenophobia is not love,
649.245	it's apathy.
650.859	If you don't see my gayness,
650.859	then you don't see me.
654.963	If it doesn't matter to you
654.963	who I sleep with,
657.949	then you cannot imagine what it feels like
660.135	when I walk down the street
660.135	late at night holding her hand,
663.011	and approach a group of people
663.011	and have to make the decision
665.829	if I should hang on to it
665.829	or if I should I drop it
668.175	when all I want to do
668.175	is squeeze it tighter.
670.494	And the small victory I feel
673.012	when I make it by
673.012	and don't have to let go.
675.72	And the incredible cowardice
675.72	and disappointment I feel when I drop it.
680.839	If you do not see that struggle
682.788	that is unique to my human experience
682.788	because I am gay, then you don't see me.
689.264	If you are going to be an ally,
689.264	I need you to see me.
694.679	As individuals, as allies, as humans,
697.622	we need to be able to hold both things:
700.622	both the good and the bad,
703.07	the easy and the hard.
704.9	You don't learn how to hold
704.9	two things just from the fluff,
709.372	you learn it from the grit.
711.774	And what if duality
711.774	is just the first step?
716.308	What if through compassion
716.308	and empathy and human interaction
721.138	we are able to learn to hold two things?
723.533	And if we can hold
723.533	two things, we can hold four,
725.848	and if we can hold four,
725.848	we can hold eight,
727.859	and if we can hold eight,
727.859	we can hold hundreds.
730.1	We are complex individuals,
732.562	swirls of contradiction.
734.362	You are all holding
734.362	so many things right now.
737.888	What can you do to hold just a few more?
742.1	So, back to Toledo, Ohio.
744.237	I'm at the front of the line,
746.417	niece on my shoulders,
746.417	the frazzled clerk calls me Dad.
750.52	Have you ever been mistaken
750.52	for the wrong gender?
755.111	Not even that.
757.31	Have you ever been called
757.31	something you are not?
763.509	Here's what it feels like for me:
766.04	I am instantly an internal storm
766.04	of contrasting emotions.
770.114	I break out into a sweat that is
770.114	a combination of rage and humiliation,
775.657	I feel like the entire store
775.657	is staring at me,
778.618	and I simultaneously feel invisible.
781.179	I want to explode in a tirade of fury,
784.123	and I want to crawl under a rock.
786.717	And top all of that off
786.717	with the frustration that I'm wearing
789.82	an out-of-character
789.82	tight-fitting purple t-shirt,
793.418	so this whole store can see my boobs,
795.456	to make sure this exact
795.456	same thing doesn't happen.
798.458	(Laughter)
800.64	But, despite my best efforts
800.64	to be seen as the gender I am,
804.962	it still happens.
806.804	And I hope with every ounce
806.804	of my body that no one heard --
811.497	not my sister, not my girlfriend,
811.497	and certainly not my niece.
816.05	I am accustomed to this familiar hurt,
818.491	but I will do whatever I need to do
818.491	to protect the people I love from it.
823.906	But then I take my niece off my shoulders,
826.441	and she runs to Elsa and Anna --
828.616	the thing she's been
828.616	waiting so long for --
831.183	and all that stuff goes away.
833.27	All that matters is the smile on her face.
836.98	And as the 30 seconds we waited
836.98	two and a half hours for comes to a close
842.638	we gather up our things,
842.638	and I lock eyes with the clerk again;
847.842	and she gives me
847.842	an apologetic smile and mouths,
850.979	"""I am so sorry!"""
853.276	(Laughter)
855.386	And her humanity, her willingness to admit
855.386	her mistake disarms me immediately,
861.243	"then I give her a: ""It's okay,"
861.243	"it happens. But thanks."""
866.416	And I realize in that moment
869.407	that I don't have to be
871.445	either an aunt
871.445	or an advocate, I can be both.
876.903	I can live in duality,
876.903	and I can hold two things.
882.252	And if I can hold two things
882.252	in that environment,
885.19	I can hold so many more things.
887.543	As my girlfriend and my niece hold hands
887.543	and skip out the front of the door,
891.296	I turn to my sister and say,
891.296	"""Was it worth it?"""
894.04	"And she said, ""Are you kidding me?"
895.815	Did you see the look on her face?
895.815	"This was the greatest day of her life!"""
899.703	(Laughter)
900.801	"""It was worth the two"
900.801	and a half hours in the heat,
903.759	it was worth the overpriced coloring book
903.759	"that we already had a copy of."""
908.147	(Laughter)
909.855	"""It was even worth you "
909.855	"getting called Dad."""
913.51	(Laughter)
917.205	And for the first time ever
917.205	in my life, it actually was.
922.92	Thank you, Boulder. Have a good night.
925.099	(Applause)
