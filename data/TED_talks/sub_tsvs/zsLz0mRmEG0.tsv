12.785	What if I could present you a story
14.689	that you would remember
14.689	with your entire body
17.127	and not just with your mind?
19.308	My whole life as a journalist,
19.308	I've really been compelled
22.007	to try to make stories
22.007	that can make a difference
24.342	and maybe inspire people to care.
26.936	I've worked in print.
26.936	I've worked in documentary.
29.286	I've worked in broadcast.
30.579	But it really wasn't until
30.579	I got involved with virtual reality
33.665	that I started seeing
33.665	these really intense,
36.53	authentic reactions from people
38.538	that really blew my mind.
40.237	So the deal is that with VR,
40.237	virtual reality,
44.934	I can put you on scene
47.958	in the middle of the story.
50.148	By putting on these goggles
50.148	that track wherever you look,
53.656	you get this whole-body sensation,
56.608	like you're actually, like, there.
59.209	So five years ago was about when
59.209	I really began to push the envelope
62.635	with using virtual reality
62.635	and journalism together.
65.909	And I wanted to do a piece about hunger.
68.481	Families in America are going hungry,
68.481	food banks are overwhelmed,
71.664	and they're often running out of food.
74.33	Now, I knew I couldn't
74.33	make people feel hungry,
77.973	but maybe I could figure out a way
77.973	to get them to feel something physical.
82.726	So -- again, this is five years ago --
85.814	so doing journalism
85.814	and virtual reality together
89.014	was considered
89.014	a worse-than-half-baked idea,
92.021	and I had no funding.
93.4	Believe me, I had a lot
93.4	of colleagues laughing at me.
95.923	And I did, though,
95.923	have a really great intern,
99.737	a woman named Michaela Kobsa-Mark.
101.999	And together we went out to food banks
103.841	and started recording
103.841	audio and photographs.
106.937	Until one day she came back to my office
108.881	and she was bawling, she was just crying.
111.3	She had been on scene at a long line,
113.926	where the woman running the line
113.926	was feeling extremely overwhelmed,
117.895	and she was screaming,
117.895	"""There's too many people!"
120.887	"There's too many people!"""
122.807	And this man with diabetes
122.807	doesn't get food in time,
126.386	his blood sugar drops too low,
126.386	and he collapses into a coma.
130.695	As soon as I heard that audio,
132.251	I knew that this would be
132.251	the kind of evocative piece
135.52	that could really describe
135.52	what was going on at food banks.
139.29	So here's the real line.
139.29	You can see how long it was, right?
142.93	And again, as I said, we didn't
142.93	have very much funding,
145.581	so I had to reproduce it
145.581	with virtual humans that were donated,
149.355	and people begged and borrowed favors
149.355	to help me create the models
153.505	and make things as accurate as we could.
155.688	And then we tried to convey
155.688	what happened that day
158.321	with as much as accuracy as is possible.
161.68	(Video) Voice: There's too many people!
161.68	There's too many people!
174.34	Voice: OK, he's having a seizure.
191.023	Voice: We need an ambulance.
194.181	Nonny de la Pe√±a: So the man on the right,
196.222	for him, he's walking around the body.
198.118	For him, he's in the room with that body.
201.355	Like, that guy is at his feet.
203.601	And even though,
203.601	through his peripheral vision,
205.832	he can see that he's in this lab space,
207.927	he should be able to see
207.927	that he's not actually on the street,
212.164	but he feels like he's there
212.164	with those people.
215.084	He's very cautious not to step on this guy
217.118	who isn't really there, right?
219.506	So that piece ended up
219.506	going to Sundance in 2012,
222.633	a kind of amazing thing,
222.633	and it was the first virtual reality film
226.578	ever, basically.
229.062	And when we went, I was really terrified.
231.047	I didn't really know
231.047	how people were going to react
233.508	and what was going to happen.
234.921	And we showed up
234.921	with this duct-taped pair of goggles.
237.842	(Video) Oh, you're crying.
237.842	You're crying. Gina, you're crying.
241.851	So you can hear
241.851	the surprise in my voice, right?
244.595	And this kind of reaction ended up being
244.595	the kind of reaction we saw
248.214	over and over and over:
251.008	people down on the ground
251.008	trying to comfort the seizure victim,
254.738	trying to whisper something into his ear
256.682	or in some way help,
256.682	even though they couldn't.
260.664	And I had a lot of people
260.664	come out of that piece saying,
263.372	"""Oh my God, I was so frustrated."
263.372	"I couldn't help the guy,"""
266.12	and take that back into their lives.
268.999	So after this piece was made,
272.198	the dean of the cinema school at USC,
272.198	the University of Southern California,
276.031	brought in the head of the World
276.031	"Economic Forum to try ""Hunger,"""
280.262	and he took off the goggles,
281.627	and he commissioned
281.627	a piece about Syria on the spot.
284.691	And I really wanted to do something
284.691	about Syrian refugee kids,
287.628	because children have been the worst
287.628	affected by the Syrian civil war.
292.809	I sent a team to the border of Iraq
292.809	to record material at refugee camps,
296.791	basically an area I wouldn't
296.791	send a team now,
299.966	as that's where ISIS is really operating.
302.458	And then we also recreated a street scene
305.188	in which a young girl is singing
305.188	and a bomb goes off.
309.34	Now, when you're
309.34	in the middle of that scene
311.443	and you hear those sounds,
314.021	and you see the injured around you,
316.338	it's an incredibly scary and real feeling.
319.362	I've had individuals who have been
319.362	involved in real bombings tell me
323.926	that it evokes the same kind of fear.
328.211	[The civil war in Syria may seem far away]
334.078	[until you experience it yourself.]
341.062	(Girl singing)
348.037	(Explosion)
350.839	[Project Syria]
355.988	[A virtual reality experience]
358.653	NP: We were then invited to take the piece
360.745	to the Victoria and Albert
360.745	Museum in London.
362.823	And it wasn't advertised.
364.204	And we were put in this tapestry room.
366.552	There was no press about it,
367.918	so anybody who happened to walk
367.918	into the museum to visit it that day
371.679	would see us with these crazy lights.
373.466	You know, maybe they would want to see
373.466	the old storytelling of the tapestries.
377.165	They were confronted
377.165	by our virtual reality cameras.
380.513	But a lot of people tried it,
380.513	and over a five-day run
383.664	we ended up with 54 pages
383.664	of guest book comments,
388.228	and we were told by the curators there
390.588	that they'd never seen such an outpouring.
393.201	"Things like, ""It's so real,"""
393.201	"""Absolutely believable,"""
397.852	or, of course, the one
397.852	that I was excited about,
400.336	"""A real feeling as if you were"
400.336	in the middle of something
403.209	"that you normally see on the TV news."""
406.463	So, it works, right? This stuff works.
410.297	And it doesn't really matter
410.297	where you're from or what age you are --
414.116	it's really evocative.
416.343	Now, don't get me wrong -- I'm not saying
416.343	that when you're in a piece
420.319	you forget that you're here.
423.223	But it turns out we can feel
423.223	like we're in two places at once.
426.422	We can have what I call
426.422	this duality of presence,
429.596	and I think that's what allows me
429.596	to tap into these feelings of empathy.
434.477	Right?
436.041	So that means, of course,
439.256	that I have to be very cautious
439.256	about creating these pieces.
444.175	I have to really follow
444.175	best journalistic practices
448.461	and make sure that these powerful stories
450.62	are built with integrity.
452.23	If we don't capture
452.23	the material ourselves,
454.627	we have to be extremely exacting
459.619	about figuring out the provenance
459.619	and where did this stuff come from
462.944	and is it authentic?
464.276	Let me give you an example.
465.657	With this Trayvon Martin case,
465.657	this is a guy, a kid,
468.618	who was 17 years old and he bought
468.618	soda and a candy at a store,
472.745	and on his way home he was tracked
472.745	by a neighborhood watchman
476.245	named George Zimmerman
476.245	who ended up shooting and killing him.
479.657	To make that piece,
480.833	we got the architectural drawings
480.833	of the entire complex,
484.459	and we rebuilt the entire scene
484.459	inside and out, based on those drawings.
489.252	All of the action
490.571	is informed by the real 911
490.571	recorded calls to the police.
496.411	And interestingly, we broke
496.411	some news with this story.
499.212	The forensic house that did the audio
499.212	reconstruction, Primeau Productions,
503.211	they say that they would testify
505.181	that George Zimmerman,
505.181	when he got out of the car,
507.88	he cocked his gun before he went
507.88	to give chase to Martin.
512.013	So you can see that
512.013	the basic tenets of journalism,
515.442	they don't really change here, right?
517.339	We're still following the same principles
517.339	that we would always.
520.767	What is different is the sense
520.767	of being on scene,
524.094	whether you're watching
524.094	a guy collapse from hunger
526.459	or feeling like you're
526.459	in the middle of a bomb scene.
528.968	And this is kind of what has driven me
528.968	forward with these pieces,
533.94	and thinking about how to make them.
535.687	We're trying to make this, obviously,
535.687	beyond the headset, more available.
539.906	We're creating mobile pieces
539.906	like the Trayvon Martin piece.
542.857	And these things have had impact.
546.43	I've had Americans tell me
546.43	that they've donated,
549.026	direct deductions from their bank account,
549.026	money to go to Syrian children refugees.
553.444	"And ""Hunger in LA,"" well,"
553.444	it's helped start
555.801	a new form of doing journalism
558.254	that I think is going to join
558.254	all the other normal platforms
561.374	in the future.
562.549	Thank you.
563.737	(Applause)
