12.37	I'm a lexicographer.
13.928	I make dictionaries.
15.682	And my job as a lexicographer
17.121	is to try to put all the words possible 
17.121	into the dictionary.
20.841	My job is not to decide what a word is;
20.841	that is your job.
26.924	Everybody who speaks English 
26.924	decides together
29.821	what's a word and what's not a word.
32.153	Every language is just a group of people
32.153	who agree to understand each other.
37.305	Now, sometimes when people are trying 
37.305	to decide whether a word is good or bad,
41.909	they don't really have a good reason.
43.677	So they say something like,
43.677	"""Because grammar!"""
46.488	(Laughter)
48.862	I don't actually really care about grammar
48.862	too much -- don't tell anybody.
52.425	"But the word ""grammar,"" actually,"
52.425	there are two kinds of grammar.
55.564	There's the kind of grammar
55.564	that lives inside your brain,
58.434	and if you're a native 
58.434	speaker of a language
60.543	or a good speaker of a language,
62.132	it's the unconscious rules that you follow
62.132	when you speak that language.
65.531	And this is what you learn when
65.531	you learn a language as a child.
68.552	And here's an example:
70.189	This is a wug, right?
71.714	It's a wug.
73.775	Now there is another one.
75.471	There are two of these.
76.634	There are two ...
77.923	Audience: Wugs.
79.107	Erin McKean: Exactly! You know 
79.107	how to make the plural of wug.
82.82	That rule lives in your brain.
84.301	You never had to be taught this rule, 
84.301	you just understand it.
87.25	This is an experiment that was invented
87.25	by a professor at [Boston University]
90.879	named Jean Berko Gleason back in 1958.
94.024	So we've been talking about this 
94.024	for a long time.
97.049	Now, these kinds of natural rules 
97.049	that exist in your brain,
100.563	they're not like traffic laws,
100.563	they're more like laws of nature.
104.785	And nobody has to remind you to obey 
104.785	a law of nature, right?
108.14	When you leave the house in the morning, 
108.14	your mom doesn't say,
111.093	"""Hey, honey, I think"
111.093	it's going to be cold, take a hoodie,
113.972	"don't forget to obey the law of gravity."""
116.439	Nobody says this.
118.325	Now, there are other rules that are more
118.325	about manners than they are about nature.
125.182	So you can think of a word as like a hat.
128.046	Once you know how hats work,
130.296	nobody has to tell you, 
130.296	"""Don't wear hats on your feet."""
133.163	What they have to tell you is, 
133.163	"""Can you wear hats inside?"
136.507	Who gets to wear a hat?
138.264	What are the kinds of hats
138.264	"you get to wear?"""
141.396	Those are more of the second kind 
141.396	of grammar,
143.818	which linguists often call usage, 
143.818	as opposed to grammar.
148.121	Now, sometimes people use this kind of 
148.121	rules-based grammar
152.255	to discourage people from making up words.
155.043	And I think that is, well, stupid.
157.727	So, for example, 
157.727	people are always telling you,
160.993	"""Be creative, make new music, do art, "
160.993	"invent things, science and technology."""
166.233	But when it comes to 
166.233	words, they're like,
168.271	"""Don't! No. Creativity stops right here,"
168.271	"whippersnappers. Give it a rest."""
173.004	(Laughter)
174.421	But that makes no sense to me.
176.142	Words are great.
176.142	We should have more of them.
178.474	I want you to make
178.474	as many new words as possible.
182.53	And I'm going to tell you six ways that
182.53	you can use to make new words in English.
187.55	The first way is the simplest way.
189.639	Basically, steal them from other 
189.639	languages.
191.862	"[""Go rob other people""]"
191.862	(Laughter)
195.936	Linguists call this borrowing,
197.764	but we never give the words back ,
197.764	so I'm just going to be honest
200.824	and call it stealing.
202.784	We usually take words for things 
202.784	that we like, like delicious food.
206.154	"We took ""kumquat"" from Chinese,"
206.154	"we took ""caramel"" from French."
209.944	We also take words 
209.944	"for cool things like ""ninja,"" right?"
212.851	We took that from Japanese,
214.301	which is kind of a cool trick because 
214.301	ninjas are hard to steal from.
217.57	(Laughter)
219.684	So another way that you 
219.684	can make words in English
222.944	is by squishing two 
222.944	other English words together.
225.885	This is called compounding.
227.572	Words in English are like Lego:
229.082	If you use enough force, 
229.082	you can put any two of them together.
232.447	(Laughter)
234.832	We do this all the time in English:
236.627	"Words like ""heartbroken,"" ""bookworm,"" "
236.627	"""sandcastle"" all are compounds."
242.105	So go ahead and make words like
242.105	"""duckface,"" just don't make duckface."
245.606	(Laughter)
247.835	Another way that you can make words 
247.835	in English is kind of like compounding,
251.848	but instead you use so much force
251.848	when you squish the words together
256.899	that some parts fall off.
258.534	So these are blend words, 
260.215	"like ""brunch"" is a blend "
260.215	"of ""breakfast"" and ""lunch."""
264.064	"""Motel"" is a blend of ""motor"" and ""hotel."""
266.796	"Who here knew that ""motel"" "
266.796	was a blend word?
269.737	Yeah, that word is so old in English
271.581	that lots of people don't know that 
271.581	there are parts missing.
274.692	"""Edutainment"" is a blend "
274.692	"of ""education"" and ""entertainment."""
278.987	"And of course, ""electrocute"" is a"
278.987	"blend of ""electric"" and ""execute."""
284.197	(Laughter)
286.007	You can also make words
286.007	by changing how they operate.
289.328	This is called functional shift.
290.941	You take a word that acts 
290.941	as one part of speech,
293.242	and you change it into another 
293.242	part of speech.
295.522	"Okay, who here knew that ""friend"""
295.522	hasn't always been a verb?
300.881	"""Friend"" used to be noun "
300.881	and then we verbed it.
305.076	Almost any word in English can be verbed.
308.345	You can also take adjectives 
308.345	and make them into nouns.
310.978	"""Commercial"" used to be an adjective "
310.978	and now it's a noun.
314.705	"And of course, you can ""green"" things."
317.151	Another way to make words
317.151	in English is back-formation.
320.489	You can take a word and you can
320.489	kind of squish it down a little bit.
323.747	So for example, in English we had the word
323.747	"""editor"" before we had the word ""edit."""
328.568	"""Edit"" was formed from ""editor."""
330.32	Sometimes these back-formations 
330.32	sound a little silly:
333.065	Bulldozers bulldoze, butlers butle 
333.065	and burglers burgle.
337.453	(Laughter)
339.278	Another way to make words in English
341.05	is to take the first letters of something
341.05	and squish them together.
344.22	So National Aeronautics and Space 
344.22	Administration becomes NASA.
347.251	And of course you can do this 
347.251	with anything, OMG!
350.963	So it doesn't matter how silly 
350.963	the words are.
356.602	They can be really good words of English.
358.608	"""Absquatulate"" is a perfectly "
358.608	good word of English.
362.626	"""Mugwump"" is a perfectly "
362.626	good word of English.
365.489	So the words don't have have to sound 
365.489	normal, they can sound really silly.
370.067	Why should you make words?
372.256	You should make words because every word
374.397	is a chance to express your idea and get 
374.397	your meaning across.
378.918	And new words grab people's attention.
381.514	They get people to focus on what 
381.514	you're saying
384.163	and that gives you a better chance to get 
384.163	your meaning across.
387.427	A lot of people 
387.427	on this stage today have said,
390.376	"""In the future, you can do this,"
391.938	you can help with this, you can 
391.938	"help us explore, you can help us invent."""
395.471	You can make a new word right now.
397.1	English has no age limit.
399.433	Go ahead, start making words today,
401.859	send them to me, and I will put them 
401.859	in my online dictionary, Wordnik.
405.546	Thank you so much.
406.835	(Applause)
