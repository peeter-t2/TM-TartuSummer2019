13.16	I thought I'd begin with a scene of war.
15.16	There was little to warn of the danger ahead.
17.16	The Iraqi insurgent had placed the IED,
19.16	an Improvised Explosive Device,
22.16	along the side of the road with great care.
24.16	By 2006, there were more than 2,500
28.16	of these attacks every single month,
31.16	and they were the leading cause of
33.16	casualties among American soldiers
35.16	and Iraqi civilians.
37.16	The team that was hunting for this IED
39.16	is called an EOD team—
41.16	Explosives Ordinance Disposal—and
43.16	they're the pointy end of the spear in the
45.16	American effort to suppress these roadside bombs.
48.16	Each EOD team goes out on about
52.16	defusing about two bombs a day.
55.16	Perhaps the best sign of how valuable they
57.16	are to the war effort, is that
59.16	the Iraqi insurgents put a $50,000 bounty
61.16	on the head of a single EOD soldier.
64.16	Unfortunately, this particular call
66.16	would not end well.
68.16	By the time the soldier advanced close
70.16	enough to see the telltale wires
72.16	of the bomb, it exploded in a wave of flame.
75.16	Now, depending how close you are
77.16	and how much explosive has been packed
79.16	into that bomb, it can cause death
81.16	or injury. You have to be as far as
85.16	The blast is so strong it can even break
87.16	your limbs, even if you're not hit.
89.16	That soldier had been on top of the bomb.
91.16	And so when the rest of the team advanced
94.16	they found little left. And that night the unit's
96.16	commander did a sad duty, and he wrote
98.16	a condolence letter back to the United
100.16	States, and he talked about how hard the
102.16	loss had been on his unit, about the fact
104.16	that they had lost their bravest soldier,
106.16	a soldier who had saved their lives
108.16	many a time.
110.16	And he apologized
112.16	for not being able to bring them home.
114.16	But then he talked up the silver lining
116.16	that he took away from the loss.
118.16	"""At least,"" as he wrote, ""when a robot dies,"
120.16	you don't have to write a letter
122.16	"to its mother."""
124.16	That scene sounds like science fiction,
126.16	but is battlefield reality already.
128.16	The soldier in that case
131.16	was a 42-pound robot called a PackBot.
134.16	The chief's letter went, not to some
137.16	farmhouse in Iowa like you see
139.16	in the old war movies, but went to
142.16	the iRobot Company, which is
144.16	named after the Asimov novel
147.16	and the not-so-great Will Smith movie,
149.16	and... um... (Laughter)...
151.16	if you remember that
153.16	in that fictional world, robots started out
155.16	carrying out mundane chores, and then
157.16	they started taking on life-and-death decisions.
159.16	That's a reality we face today.
161.16	What we're going to do is actually just
163.16	flash a series of photos behind me that
165.16	show you the reality of robots used in war
168.16	right now or already at the prototype stage.
170.16	It's just to give you a taste.
173.16	Another way of putting it is you're not
175.16	going to see anything that's powered
177.16	by Vulcan technology, or teenage
179.16	wizard hormones or anything like that.
181.16	This is all real. So why don't we
183.16	go ahead and start those pictures.
185.16	Something big is going on in war today,
187.16	and maybe even the history of humanity
189.16	itself. The U.S. military went into Iraq with
192.16	a handful of drones in the air.
194.16	We now have 5,300.
197.16	We went in with zero unmanned ground
199.16	systems. We now have 12,000.
203.16	"And the tech term ""killer application"""
205.16	takes on new meaning in this space.
208.16	And we need to remember that we're
210.16	talking about the Model T Fords,
212.16	the Wright Flyers, compared
214.16	to what's coming soon.
216.16	That's where we're at right now.
218.16	One of the people that I recently met with
220.16	was an Air Force three-star general, and he
222.16	said basically, where we're headed very
224.16	soon is tens of thousands of robots
226.16	operating in our conflicts, and these
228.16	numbers matter, because we're not just
230.16	talking about tens of thousands of today's
232.16	robots, but tens of thousands of these
234.16	prototypes and tomorrow's robots, because
236.16	of course, one of the things that's operating
239.16	in technology is Moore's Law,
241.16	that you can pack in more and more
243.16	computing power into those robots, and so
245.16	flash forward around 25 years,
247.16	if Moore's Law holds true,
249.16	those robots will be close to a billion times
252.16	more powerful in their computing than today.
255.16	And so what that means is the kind of
257.16	things that we used to only talk about at
259.16	science fiction conventions like Comic-Con
261.16	have to be talked about in the halls
263.16	of power and places like the Pentagon.
265.16	A robots revolution is upon us.
268.16	Now, I need to be clear here.
270.16	I'm not talking about a revolution where you
272.16	have to worry about the Governor of
274.16	California showing up at your door,
276.16	a la the Terminator. (Laughter)
278.16	When historians look at this period, they're
280.16	going to conclude that we're in a different
282.16	type of revolution: a revolution in war,
284.16	like the invention of the atomic bomb.
286.16	But it may be even bigger than that,
288.16	because our unmanned systems don't just
290.16	"affect the ""how"" of war-fighting,"
292.16	"they affect the ""who"" of fighting"
294.16	at its most fundamental level.
296.16	That is, every previous revolution in war, be
298.16	it the machine gun, be it the atomic bomb,
300.16	was about a system that either shot faster,
303.16	went further, had a bigger boom.
306.16	That's certainly the case with robotics, but
309.16	they also change the experience of the warrior
312.16	and even the very identity of the warrior.
315.16	Another way of putting this is that
318.16	mankind's 5,000-year-old monopoly
320.16	on the fighting of war is breaking down
323.16	in our very lifetime. I've spent
325.16	the last several years going around
327.16	meeting with all the players in this field,
329.16	from the robot scientists to the science
331.16	fiction authors who inspired them to the
335.16	from Nevada, to the four-star generals
337.16	who command them, to even the Iraqi
339.16	insurgents who they are targeting and what
341.16	they think about our systems, and
343.16	what I found interesting is not just
345.16	their stories, but how their experiences
347.16	point to these ripple effects that are going
349.16	outwards in our society, in our law
351.16	and our ethics, etc. And so what I'd like
353.16	to do with my remaining time is basically
355.16	flesh out a couple of these.
357.16	So the first is that the future of war,
359.16	even a robotics one, is not going to be
361.16	purely an American one.
363.16	The U.S. is currently ahead in military
365.16	robotics right now, but we know that in
367.16	technology there's no such thing as
369.16	a permanent first move or advantage.
372.16	In a quick show of hands, how many
374.16	people in this room still use
376.16	Wang Computers? (Laughter)
378.16	It's the same thing in war. The British and
380.16	the French invented the tank.
383.16	The Germans figured out how
385.16	to use it right, and so what we have to
387.16	think about for the U.S. is that we are
389.16	ahead right now, but you have
393.16	working on military robotics, and they
395.16	include all the interesting countries like
397.16	Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran.
400.16	And this raises a bigger worry for me.
403.16	How do we move forward in this revolution
405.16	given the state of our manufacturing
407.16	and the state of our science and
409.16	mathematics training in our schools?
411.16	Or another way of thinking about this is,
413.16	what does it mean to go to war increasingly
415.16	with soldiers whose hardware is made
418.16	in China and software is written in India?
423.16	But just as software has gone open-source,
426.16	so has warfare.
428.16	Unlike an aircraft carrier or an atomic bomb,
431.16	you don't need a massive manufacturing
433.16	system to build robotics. A lot of it is
435.16	off the shelf. A lot of it's even do-it-yourself.
437.16	One of those things you just saw flashed
439.16	before you was a raven drone, the handheld
441.16	tossed one. For about a thousand dollars,
443.16	you can build one yourself, equivalent to
445.16	what the soldiers use in Iraq.
447.16	That raises another wrinkle when it comes
449.16	to war and conflict. Good guys might play
451.16	around and work on these as hobby kits,
453.16	but so might bad guys.
455.16	This cross between robotics and things like
457.16	terrorism is going to be fascinating
459.16	and even disturbing,
461.16	and we've already seen it start.
463.16	During the war between Israel, a state,
465.16	and Hezbollah, a non-state actor,
468.16	the non-state actor flew
470.16	four different drones against Israel.
472.16	There's already a jihadi website
474.16	that you can go on and remotely
476.16	detonate an IED in Iraq while sitting
478.16	at your home computer.
480.16	And so I think what we're going to see is
482.16	two trends take place with this.
484.16	First is, you're going to reinforce the power
486.16	of individuals against governments,
490.16	but then the second is that
492.16	we are going to see an expansion
494.16	in the realm of terrorism.
496.16	The future of it may be a cross between
498.16	al Qaeda 2.0 and the
500.16	next generation of the Unabomber.
502.16	And another way of thinking about this
504.16	is the fact that, remember, you don't have
506.16	to convince a robot that they're gonna
508.16	receive 72 virgins after they die
511.16	to convince them to blow themselves up.
514.16	But the ripple effects of this are going to go
516.16	out into our politics. One of the people that
518.16	I met with was a former Assistant Secretary of
520.16	Defense for Ronald Reagan, and he put it
522.16	"this way: ""I like these systems because"
524.16	they save American lives, but I worry about
526.16	more marketization of wars,
528.16	more shock-and-awe talk,
531.16	to defray discussion of the costs.
533.16	People are more likely to support the use
535.16	"of force if they view it as costless."""
538.16	Robots for me take certain trends
540.16	that are already in play in our body politic,
543.16	and maybe take them to
545.16	their logical ending point.
547.16	We don't have a draft. We don't
549.16	have declarations of war anymore.
552.16	We don't buy war bonds anymore.
554.16	And now we have the fact that we're
556.16	converting more and more of our American
558.16	soldiers that we would send into harm's
560.16	way into machines, and so we may take
563.16	those already lowering bars to war
566.16	and drop them to the ground.
569.16	But the future of war is also going to be
571.16	a YouTube war.
573.16	That is, our new technologies don't merely
575.16	remove humans from risk.
577.16	They also record everything that they see.
580.16	So they don't just delink the public:
583.16	they reshape its relationship with war.
586.16	There's already several thousand
588.16	video clips of combat footage from Iraq
590.16	on YouTube right now,
592.16	most of it gathered by drones.
594.16	Now, this could be a good thing.
596.16	It could be building connections between
598.16	the home front and the war front
600.16	as never before.
602.16	But remember, this is taking place
604.16	in our strange, weird world, and so
607.16	inevitably the ability to download these
609.16	video clips to, you know, your iPod
611.16	or your Zune gives you
614.16	the ability to turn it into entertainment.
618.16	Soldiers have a name for these clips.
620.16	They call it war porn.
622.16	The typical one that I was sent was
624.16	an email that had an attachment of
626.16	video of a Predator strike taking out
628.16	an enemy site. Missile hits,
630.16	bodies burst into the air with the explosion.
633.16	It was set to music.
635.16	It was set to the pop song
637.16	"""I Just Want To Fly"" by Sugar Ray."
640.16	This ability to watch more
643.16	but experience less creates a wrinkle
646.16	in the public's relationship with war.
648.16	I think about this with a sports parallel.
650.16	It's like the difference between
653.16	watching an NBA game, a professional
656.16	basketball game on TV, where the athletes
659.16	are tiny figures on the screen, and
661.16	being at that basketball game in person
664.16	and realizing what someone seven feet
666.16	really does look like.
668.16	But we have to remember,
670.16	these are just the clips.
672.16	These are just the ESPN SportsCenter
674.16	version of the game. They lose the context.
676.16	They lose the strategy.
678.16	They lose the humanity. War just
680.16	becomes slam dunks and smart bombs.
683.16	Now the irony of all this is that
686.16	while the future of war may involve
688.16	more and more machines,
690.16	it's our human psychology that's driving
692.16	all of this, it's our human failings
694.16	that are leading to these wars.
696.16	So one example of this that has
698.16	big resonance in the policy realm is
700.16	how this plays out on our very real
702.16	war of ideas that we're fighting
704.16	against radical groups.
706.16	What is the message that we think we are
708.16	sending with these machines versus what
710.16	is being received in terms of the message.
713.16	So one of the people that I met was
715.16	a senior Bush Administration official,
717.16	who had this to say about
719.16	our unmanning of war:
721.16	"""It plays to our strength. The thing that"
723.16	"scares people is our technology."""
725.16	But when you go out and meet with people,
727.16	for example in Lebanon, it's a very
729.16	different story. One of the people
731.16	I met with there was a news editor, and
733.16	we're talking as a drone is flying above him,
735.16	and this is what he had to say.
737.162	"""This is just another sign of the coldhearted"
739.16	cruel Israelis and Americans,
742.166	who are cowards because
744.158	they send out machines to fight us.
746.164	They don't want to fight us like real men,
748.156	but they're afraid to fight,
750.163	so we just have to kill a few of their soldiers
752.154	"to defeat them."""
755.159	The future of war also is featuring
757.166	a new type of warrior,
759.159	and it's actually redefining the experience
762.165	of going to war.
764.163	You can call this a cubicle warrior.
766.154	This is what one Predator drone pilot
768.161	described of his experience fighting
770.168	in the Iraq War while never leaving Nevada.
773.157	"""You're going to war for 12 hours,"
775.162	shooting weapons at targets,
777.168	directing kills on enemy combatants,
780.159	and then you get in the car
782.165	and you drive home and within 20 minutes,
784.163	you're sitting at the dinner table
786.169	"talking to your kids about their homework."""
788.162	Now, the psychological balancing
790.168	of those experiences is incredibly tough,
792.161	and in fact those drone pilots have
795.153	higher rates of PTSD than many
797.161	of the units physically in Iraq.
800.166	But some have worries that this
802.158	disconnection will lead to something else,
804.167	that it might make the contemplation of war
806.165	crimes a lot easier when you have
808.17	"this distance. ""It's like a video game,"""
810.169	is what one young pilot described to me
812.168	of taking out enemy troops from afar.
814.158	As anyone who's played Grand Theft Auto
817.168	knows, we do things in the video world
820.168	that we wouldn't do face to face.
823.164	So much of what you're hearing from me
825.162	is that there's another side
827.155	to technologic revolutions,
829.163	and that it's shaping our present
831.157	and maybe will shape our future of war.
834.158	Moore's Law is operative,
836.159	but so's Murphy's Law.
838.157	The fog of war isn't being lifted.
840.162	The enemy has a vote.
842.172	We're gaining incredible new capabilities,
844.161	but we're also seeing and experiencing
846.167	new human dilemmas. Now,
848.167	"sometimes these are just ""oops"" moments,"
850.166	which is what the head of a robotics
852.158	company described it, you just have
854.169	"""oops"" moments. Well, what are"
856.169	"""oops"" moments with robots in war?"
858.165	Well, sometimes they're funny. Sometimes,
860.166	they're like that scene from the
862.168	"Eddie Murphy movie ""Best Defense,"""
864.169	playing out in reality, where they tested out
866.17	a machine gun-armed robot, and during
868.158	the demonstration it started spinning
870.159	in a circle and pointed its machine gun
873.168	at the reviewing stand of VIPs.
876.163	Fortunately the weapon wasn't loaded
878.156	and no one was hurt, but other times
880.166	"""oops"" moments are tragic,"
882.158	such as last year in South Africa, where
884.16	an anti-aircraft cannon had a
887.159	"""software glitch,"" and actually did turn on"
890.158	and fired, and nine soldiers were killed.
893.162	We have new wrinkles in the laws of war
896.159	and accountability. What do we do
898.156	with things like unmanned slaughter?
900.166	What is unmanned slaughter?
902.164	We've already had three instances of
904.164	Predator drone strikes where we thought
906.164	we got bin Laden, and it turned out
908.158	not to be the case.
910.16	And this is where we're at right now.
912.168	This is not even talking about armed,
914.168	autonomous systems
916.157	with full authority to use force.
918.17	And do not believe that that isn't coming.
920.164	During my research I came across
922.171	four different Pentagon projects
924.156	on different aspects of that.
926.168	And so you have this question:
928.17	what does this lead to issues like
930.163	war crimes? Robots are emotionless, so
932.155	they don't get upset if their buddy is killed.
935.167	They don't commit crimes of rage
937.161	and revenge.
939.168	But robots are emotionless.
942.165	They see an 80-year-old grandmother
944.164	in a wheelchair the same way they see
946.164	a T-80 tank: they're both
949.166	just a series of zeroes and ones.
952.159	And so we have this question to figure out:
955.162	How do we catch up our 20th century
957.165	laws of war, that are so old right now
959.154	that they could qualify for Medicare,
962.162	to these 21st century technologies?
965.17	And so, in conclusion, I've talked about
968.157	what seems the future of war,
971.168	but notice that I've only used
973.158	real world examples and you've only seen
975.17	real world pictures and videos.
977.171	And so this sets a great challenge for
979.171	all of us that we have to worry about well
981.157	before you have to worry about your
983.166	Roomba sucking the life away from you.
985.167	Are we going to let the fact that what's
987.166	unveiling itself right now in war
990.166	sounds like science fiction and therefore
993.157	keeps us in denial?
995.162	Are we going to face the reality
997.166	of 21st century war?
999.159	Is our generation going to make the same
1001.16	mistake that a past generation did
1003.169	with atomic weaponry, and not deal with
1005.167	the issues that surround it until
1007.162	Pandora's box is already opened up?
1009.169	Now, I could be wrong on this, and
1011.167	one Pentagon robot scientist told me
1013.171	"that I was. He said, ""There's no real"
1015.165	social, ethical, moral issues when it comes
1017.16	to robots.
1019.158	"That is,"" he added, ""unless the machine"
1021.159	kills the wrong people repeatedly.
1024.169	"Then it's just a product recall issue."""
1027.158	And so the ending point for this is
1030.169	that actually, we can turn to Hollywood.
1035.171	A few years ago, Hollywood gathered
1037.167	all the top characters and created
1040.173	a list of the top 100 heroes and
1042.17	top 100 villains of all of Hollywood history,
1045.16	the characters that represented the best
1047.166	and worst of humanity.
1049.158	Only one character made it onto both lists:
1053.173	The Terminator, a robot killing machine.
1056.169	And so that points to the fact that
1058.157	our machines can be used
1060.17	for both good and evil, but for me
1062.169	it points to the fact that there's a duality
1064.165	of humans as well.
1067.165	This week is a celebration
1069.163	of our creativity. Our creativity
1071.162	has taken our species to the stars.
1073.16	Our creativity has created works of arts
1075.167	and literature to express our love.
1078.163	And now, we're using our creativity
1080.161	in a certain direction, to build fantastic
1082.169	machines with incredible capabilities,
1085.156	maybe even one day
1087.165	an entirely new species.
1090.162	But one of the main reasons that we're
1092.167	doing that is because of our drive
1094.165	to destroy each other, and so the question
1097.165	we all should ask:
1099.159	is it our machines, or is it us
1101.159	that's wired for war?
1103.166	Thank you. (Applause)
