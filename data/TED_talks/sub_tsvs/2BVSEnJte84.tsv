13.45	I'm going to begin today with a story
15.474	and end with a revolution.
17.499	(Laughter)
18.858	Are you ready?
20.048	Audience: Yes!
21.233	Naomi McDougall-Jones: Here's the story.
23.162	All my life I wanted to be an actress.
25.168	From the time I was very small,
25.168	I could feel the magic of storytelling
28.644	and I wanted to be a part of it.
30.668	So, at the ripe age of 21,
32.424	I graduated from the American
32.424	Academy of Dramatic Arts
35.05	in New York City,
36.236	bright-eyed and bushy-tailed,
36.236	and ready to take my rightful place
39.428	as the next Meryl Streep.
41.662	That's my grandmother, not Meryl Streep.
43.635	(Laughter)
44.667	Now, it's important for this story
44.667	that you understand
47.348	that I was raised by a raging feminist.
49.373	I mean, just to give you some idea:
51.303	when I was five or six years old
51.303	"and obsessed with ""The Sound of Music,"""
54.884	and running around, singing,
54.884	"""I am 16 going on 17,"""
57.336	all day every day,
58.932	my mother sat me down
58.932	for a very serious conversation
61.665	"and she said, ""OK, look."
63.46	I'm not going to say
63.46	that you can't sing that song,
66.52	but if you are going to sing that song,
66.52	I do need you to understand
70.099	the extremely problematic
70.099	"gender construct that it reinforces."""
73.142	(Laughter)
75.244	So that's where I come from.
76.917	So it just honestly never
76.917	even occurred to me
79.308	that I would be prevented
79.308	from doing anything in my life
81.994	because I'm a woman.
83.378	OK. So I graduate.
84.553	And I start auditioning
84.553	and I get work, slowly.
87.351	But I just start noticing
87.351	that the parts available for women
90.619	are terrible.
92.353	But, remember -- I came here
94.193	to play smart, willful,
94.193	complicated, interesting
97.603	complex, confident
97.603	female characters, right?
100.668	Like Meryl.
102.172	And all of the sudden,
103.604	I am wrestling with 300 other
103.604	gorgeous, talented women
107.12	to play ...
108.708	"""[Female] No dialogue."
110.732	The character only needs
110.732	to stand on a balcony,
113.183	look forlorn, and walk back
113.183	inside the house.
115.845	"Only partial nudity."""
117.178	(Laughter)
118.934	"""[Sarah] Brian's love interest."
120.958	Attractive, cute, and flirty,
120.958	she is the ideal girl and Brian's prize
124.992	"throughout the entire film."""
127.349	"""[Mom] A proper Southern belle"
127.349	who is making peace with the fact
131.084	that her only purpose in life
131.084	"is to tend to her husband."""
134.788	"""[Abby] Must be OK"
134.788	with a tastefully shot gang rape,
138.297	"along with performing 19th-century dance."""
140.955	(Laughter)
143.168	Those are actual casting notices.
146.467	And so I just mentioned this
146.467	to my agent one day,
148.934	"I say, ""I feel like I'm not really"
148.934	going in for parts
151.675	that I'm actually excited about playing.
154.158	"And he said, ""Yeah. I don't really know"
154.158	what to do with you.
157.497	You're too smart for the parts
159.02	that are being written
159.02	for women in their 20s,
161.224	and you're not quite pretty enough
161.224	to be the hot one,
163.863	"so I think you'll work when you're 35."""
165.887	(Laughter)
167.342	"And I said, ""Oh. That's funny."
168.797	I always thought that when you were 35,
168.797	you were kind of, like,
171.834	over the hill as an actress,
173.225	that you were relegated to playing
176.025	"And he said, ""Yeah --"
177.419	(Laughter)
180.135	"It's just the way it is."""
182.937	So, maybe a year or so after this,
185.369	I'm having lunch
185.369	with an actress friend of mine,
187.663	and we're talking about
187.663	how insane this is.
189.704	And we decide, you know what? No problem.
192.233	We'll just make our own movie.
193.818	And I'll write and then I'll write it
193.818	about two complex female characters.
197.716	So we do.
198.89	We set out to make this movie,
200.393	and sort of accidentally, we end up hiring
200.393	an all-female production team:
203.903	the writer, directors, producers,
205.527	and it's a film about two women.
207.111	And so pretty soon,
207.111	we're sitting in the office
209.379	of a successful male producer,
210.98	"and he goes, ""OK, girls."
213.467	So, you do understand that at some point
213.467	you are going to have to hire
216.802	a male producer onboard, right?
218.721	Just so that people
218.721	"will trust you with their money."""
223.116	Over and over again, people tell us,
225.318	"""Yeah, but people don't really"
225.318	want to see films about women,
228.325	so maybe you should think about
228.325	making something else.
231.044	"It's just the way it is."""
234.161	So we make the movie, anyway.
235.919	We scrape together 80,000 dollars,
238.192	and we make it, and it does so well.
240.596	It gets into tons of festivals
240.596	and we win a lot of awards
243.889	and it's big and exciting.
246.389	But these experiences I've had
246.389	just keep rubbing at me.
249.761	And so, I just start talking about them,
251.905	first, at Q and A's after
251.905	screenings of the film,
254.859	and then I get invited to be on panels
254.859	and talk at conferences.
257.955	And the really amazing thing
257.955	is that, to begin with,
260.457	when I'm just talking to audiences
262.207	and other people, you know,
262.207	coming up in the film industry,
265.099	the universal reaction is,
267.123	"""Oh my god! This is terrible."
267.123	"What do we do about this?"""
270.902	But the bigger panels I get on,
273.211	suddenly an Oscar nominee tells me,
275.933	"""Look, I totally agree"
275.933	with everything you're saying.
278.493	You just need to be really careful
278.493	"about where you say it."""
281.958	An Oscar-winning producer tells me
283.685	that she doesn't think it's a good idea
283.685	to play the woman card.
287.322	It's just the way it is.
290.566	And I think this is how
290.566	sexism continues on in 2016, right?
294.445	For the most part, it happens casually --
297.255	unconsciously, even.
298.952	It happens because people
298.952	are just trying to get along
301.572	within an existing system.
303.121	It happens, maybe, out of a genuine desire
306.467	to teach a young woman
306.467	"the way that the world ""just is."""
310.556	The problem is that unless we do
310.556	something about it,
313.041	that is the way the world will always be.
316.628	So why should you care about this?
318.484	Right?
319.663	I mean, we're facing some rather
319.663	significant problems in the world
322.922	just at present,
324.098	what does it really matter
324.098	if I can't get a job,
326.461	or you're stuck watching
326.461	"""Transformer 17,"" right?"
328.808	(Laughter)
330.57	Well, let me put it to you this way:
332.911	"the year ""Jaws"" came out,"
334.319	Americans suddenly started listing
334.319	"""sharks"" among their top 10 major fears."
340.01	In 1995, BMW paid the James Bond franchise
340.01	three million dollars
345.72	to have James Bond switch
345.72	from driving an Aston Martin
348.637	to a BMW Z3.
351.122	That one move caused so many people
351.122	to go out and buy that car,
355.695	that BMW made 240 million dollars
355.695	in pre-sales alone.
361.367	"The year that ""Brave"""
361.367	"and ""Hunger Games"" came out,"
364.036	female participation in archery
364.036	went up 105 percent.
367.477	(Laughter)
370.389	In fact, studies show
371.757	that the movies you watch
371.757	don't just affect your hobbies,
375.488	they affect your career choices,
375.488	your emotions, your sense of identity,
380.805	your relationships, your mental health --
380.805	even your marital status.
385.924	So now, consider this:
388.29	if you have watched
388.29	mostly American movies in your lifetime,
	you have ever seen
396.975	were directed by men.
399.507	Somewhere between 80 and 90 percent
399.507	of all of the leading characters
403.189	that you have ever seen
405.358	were men.
406.802	And even if we just talk about
406.802	the last five years,
	that you have seen a woman in a movie,
413.902	she was naked or scantily clad.
417.804	That affects you.
419.949	That affects all of us.
422.315	We actually can't even imagine
422.315	how much it affects us,
425.01	because this is all we've ever had.
427.881	Stories -- and movies
427.881	are just modern stories --
430.571	are not frivolous.
432.571	They're actually the mechanism
432.571	through which we process
435.348	our experience of being alive.
438.045	They're the way
438.045	that we understand the world
440.199	and our place in it.
441.655	They're the way we develop empathy
443.451	for people who have experiences
443.451	different than our own.
447.06	And right now, all of that
447.06	is being funneled at us
450.303	through the prism of this one perspective.
453.03	It's not that it's a bad perspective,
454.95	but don't we deserve to hear them all?
457.786	How would the world be different
457.786	if all of the stories were told?
461.851	So what do we do about this?
463.652	This may be the first time
463.652	a lot of you are hearing about this,
466.795	but a lot of us within the film industry
466.795	have spent years --
470.323	a lot of people,
470.323	a lot longer than I have --
472.996	giving speeches and doing panels
472.996	and writing articles
475.656	and doing studies,
476.834	and really just yelling at Hollywood
476.834	to do a better job about this.
480.927	I mean, we have really yelled at them.
484.682	And yet, Paramount and Fox
484.682	recently released their slates,
488.705	and of the 47 films that they will release
488.705	between now and 2018,
493.361	not a single one
493.361	will be directed by a woman.
499.708	So it is beginning to occur to me
501.614	that waiting for Hollywood
501.614	to grow a conscience
504.641	may not actually be a winning strategy.
507.406	In fact, it seems to me
508.625	that whenever there is a small,
508.625	ruling class of people
511.532	who have all of the money
511.532	and power and resources,
514.452	they're not actually that excited
514.452	about giving it up.
517.901	And so you don't get change by asking them
520.677	or even yelling at them.
522.869	You have to make that change happen
525.504	through a revolution.
527.761	Now, please don't worry --
527.761	I promise you, here, now, today,
532.293	our body count will be very low.
534.317	(Laughter)
536.57	So, now before I get to my four-point
536.57	plan for the revolution --
540.247	yes, I have a four-point plan --
541.912	I have two pieces of very good
541.912	and important news for you.
544.753	Good news number one:
546.008	there are female filmmakers.
548.365	(Cheers and applause)
549.642	Yes! I know!
551.093	(Applause)
552.274	We exist!
554.455	We actually graduate from film schools
556.582	at the same rate that men
556.582	do -- 50 percent.
558.929	So here we have our 50 women.
561.251	The problem is that as soon as you get
561.251	to the micro-budget film,
564.462	so even the very smallest films,
566.047	we're already only directing 18 percent.
569.331	Then you get to slightly bigger films,
571.355	indies in the $1-5 million budget range,
574.51	and we go down to 12 percent.
576.141	So by the time you get
576.141	to the studio system,
578.668	we're only directing
578.668	five percent of movies.
581.755	Now, I know some of you out there
581.755	will look at this
585.075	and secretly think to yourselves,
586.982	"""Well, maybe women"
586.982	"just aren't as good at directing movies."""
590.567	And that's not a totally insane question.
592.766	I mean, we like to believe
592.766	the film industry is a meritocracy, right?
596.147	(Laughs)
597.456	(Laughter)
599.527	But look at this trajectory.
601.299	Either you have to accept
602.686	that women are actually
602.686	five percent as talented as men,
606.961	which I don't,
608.143	or you have to accept
608.143	that there are serious systemic issues
611.187	preventing us from getting
611.187	from here to there.
614.024	But the good news is, we exist,
616.463	and there is a vast amount
616.463	of untapped potential over here.
620.802	Good news number two,
620.802	and this is really good news:
625.411	films by and about women make more money.
629.369	Yes! Yes! It's true!
632.517	(Cheers and applause)
633.877	It's true.
635.545	The Washington Post
635.545	recently released a study
637.888	showing that films that feature women
637.888	make 23 cents more on every dollar
642.72	than films that don't.
644.506	Furthermore, my colleagues and I
644.506	commissioned a study
647.094	comparing 1,700 films
647.094	made over the last five years
650.254	and, looking at the average
650.254	returns on investment --
652.827	so, how much money does that movie make --
654.874	comparing if a man or a woman
654.874	filled each of the following roles:
658.248	director, producer,
658.248	screenwriter and lead actor.
661.884	And in every single category,
664.585	the return on investment is higher
664.585	if it's a woman.
668.797	Fact: women buy 51 percent
668.797	of all movie tickets.
673.361	Films by and about women make more money.
675.927	And of course, at least
675.927	some portion of the male population
678.893	does also like women --
680.132	(Laughter)
683.281	"so ""women films"" are not just for women."
686.75	And yet, Hollywood only targets
690.892	"as ""women films."""
692.598	So what you're left with
692.598	is a giant underserved audience
696.692	and untapped profit potential.
700.937	So we exist, and we have stories to tell.
703.921	We have so many stories to tell.
706.754	And despite everything we've heard:
706.754	you want to see them.
711.044	The problem is, we've got this thing --
711.044	"let's call it ""Hollywood"" --"
715.127	(Laughter)
717.457	no, no, I'm just kidding;
718.699	I've met some very nice
718.699	people in Hollywood --
721.03	Hollywood, preventing us
721.03	from getting to you.
724.064	So here is my four-point plan
724.064	for the revolution,
726.376	and everybody -- man or woman,
726.376	in this room or anywhere in the world --
729.77	is going to get to help.
731.003	And this revolution is not just for women.
733.643	Anyone who has been disenfranchised,
735.849	anyone whose story has not been told,
738.784	the same principles apply,
740.088	and I really hope we can do
740.088	the revolution together.
744.392	My four-point plan.
746.371	Number one: watch movies.
748.991	Isn't this a good revolution?
750.499	(Laughter)
751.593	OK, first I want to talk to anyone
751.593	who watches movies.
754.176	Who watches movies in here?
755.834	Great!
757.009	Will you pledge to watch one film
757.009	by a female filmmaker per month?
761.038	That's it, just start there. Great!
763.133	If you need help finding them,
764.723	you can go to the website, moviesbyher.com
768.009	It's an easily searchable database
768.009	of films by women.
772.783	And as you start watching all movies,
775.139	I just want you to pay attention
775.139	to the female characters.
778.011	How many of them are there?
779.332	What are they wearing?
780.545	Or not?
782.024	Do they get to do cool things,
783.5	or are they just there
783.5	to emotionally support the men?
787.213	I'm telling you, once you see this,
787.213	you're not going to be able to unsee it.
790.928	And as you start noticing this,
790.928	it's going to shift your viewing habits.
794.534	And this already sizable market
794.534	is going to continue to grow.
798.455	Step two: make movies.
801.361	So now I'm talking to all
801.361	the female filmmakers out there:
804.861	we need you to be very brave.
807.741	It will be harder for you to make movies.
810.614	In fact, there will be an entire industry
810.614	constantly telling you
814.011	that your stories don't matter.
816.28	And we need you to make them, anyway.
818.724	That 18 percent in the micro-budget
818.724	range -- that is on us to fix.
823.134	Don't wait for permission.
825.158	Don't wait for somebody to pick you,
827.182	because 95 percent says
827.182	they are not going to.
830.269	Crowd fund.
831.448	Write letters to eccentric relatives.
833.35	I know how hard it is,
834.74	but you have to make your movies --
834.74	now, today, features, not shorts.
839.452	There is an audience for them,
839.452	and they want and need to see them.
844.321	Three: invest in each other.
847.89	Fellow female filmmakers, I feel like
847.89	we need to stop wasting so much energy
851.882	on a system that does not want us.
853.969	We need to find our audience
853.969	and invest in cultivating them.
857.599	If we can figure out
857.599	how to make our movies
859.856	and deliver them
859.856	to the audiences that want them,
862.364	that's it.
863.548	That's the whole game.
864.937	And whatever they're doing in the middle
866.927	is going to cease to be
866.927	quite so important.
869.222	Audiences, invest in us.
872.293	Help us make the movies
872.293	that you want to see.
875.255	If you can give a female filmmaker
879.218	great, do that.
880.518	If you can invest more seriously
882.139	and help us over that critical
882.139	million-dollar hurdle,
884.677	do that.
885.868	But invest in seeing
885.868	the other half of the story.
890.575	Four: disrupt through business.
893.352	So now I'm talking
893.352	to all of the businesspeople
895.817	and entrepreneurs.
897.149	This does not happen
897.149	very often in the world,
899.587	but right here we have a golden situation
902.207	in which you can enact
902.207	significant social change
905.052	while also making money.
908.274	Hollywood is a system ripe for disruption.
911.218	The old models of financing
911.218	and distribution are crumbling --
914.216	please come in and disrupt it.
916.954	I'll give you an example.
918.618	Right now, with some incredible women,
920.592	"I am launching the ""The 51 Fund."""
922.805	It's a venture capital fund
924.312	that will finance films written, directed
924.312	and produced by women
927.663	in that critical $1-5 million range.
931.057	We will give a significant number
931.057	of female filmmakers
933.78	the chance to make their movies
935.339	and we will deliver them
935.339	to the audiences who want them.
938.098	Good for equality, good for business.
941.719	But that's only one example, we need more.
943.909	There is room for so many more.
946.044	So I say to you:
947.422	Hollywood is leaving money on the table.
950.073	Come pick it up.
952.361	(Applause)
956.767	Now, all of this may seem like a lot,
956.767	but it is actually so doable.
960.821	Entrenched systems don't change
960.821	because you ask the people in charge,
964.488	they change because all of the people
964.488	who don't have what they want
967.748	rise up and make that change happen.
970.391	And don't you want to?
972.52	I want to see what the other
977.337	I want to watch movies
977.337	that teach me about people
979.754	who are different than I am.
981.68	I want to see women's bodies on film
981.68	that aren't perfect.
986.237	I want to give our little boys the chance
988.524	to empathize with female characters
990.407	so that they can become more whole men.
993.381	And I definitely want
993.381	to give a little girl
995.534	who may not have a real-life role model
997.515	the chance to watch movies
998.899	and see women doing everything
998.899	she dreams of achieving.
1002.528	This is not about
1002.528	making one industry better.
1005.724	This is about making a better world.
1008.485	Will you help?
1010.905	The time for waiting is over.
1012.669	The time for the revolution is now.
1014.939	(Cheers and applause)
