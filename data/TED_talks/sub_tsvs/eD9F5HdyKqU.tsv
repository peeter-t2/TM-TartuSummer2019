12.954	It is very fashionable and proper 
12.954	to speak about food
20.319	in all its forms, all its colors, 
20.319	aromas and tastes.
27.529	But after the food goes through 
27.529	the digestive system,
33.183	when it is thrown out as crap,
36.429	it is no longer fashionable
36.429	to speak about it.
40.026	It is rather revolting.
45.192	I'm a guy who has graduated 
45.192	from bullshit to full-shit.
52.732	(Laughter)
55.801	My organization, Gram Vikas, which means
55.801	"""village development organization,"""
62.466	was working in the area 
62.466	of renewable energy.
65.572	On the most part, we were 
65.572	producing biogas,
69.322	biogas for rural kitchens.
74.257	We produce biogas in India 
74.257	by using animal manure,
80.147	which usually, in India, 
80.147	is called cow dung.
82.551	But as the gender-sensitive 
82.551	person that I am,
86.605	I would like to call it bullshit.
89.533	But realizing later on
91.916	how important were sanitation
91.916	and the disposal of crap in a proper way,
99.493	we went into the arena of sanitation.
105.071	Eighty percent of all diseases 
105.071	in India and most developing countries
113.87	are because of poor quality water.
117.917	And when we look at the reason 
117.917	for poor quality water,
121.511	you find that it is our abysmal attitude 
121.511	to the disposal of human waste.
128.305	Human waste, in its rawest form,
132.344	finds its way back to drinking water,
132.344	bathing water, washing water,
138.4	irrigation water, whatever water you see.
142.293	And this is the cause for 80 percent 
142.293	of the diseases in rural areas.
149.474	In India, it is unfortunately only the
149.474	women who carry water.
155.695	So for all domestic needs,
155.695	women have to carry water.
160.824	So that is a pitiable state of affairs.
166.178	Open defecation is rampant.
168.761	Seventy percent of India
168.761	defecates in the open.
173.713	They sit there out in the open,
176.15	with the wind on their sails,
178.178	hiding their faces, exposing their bases,
182.021	and sitting there in pristine glory --
189.195	And if you look at the world total,
	into the open is by Indians.
201.153	A fantastic distinction.
203.929	I don't know if we Indians can be proud
203.929	of such a distinction.
208.081	(Laughter)
210.096	So we, together with a lot of villages,
212.278	we began to talk about how to really 
212.278	address this situation of sanitation.
217.022	And we came together and formed 
217.022	a project called MANTRA.
222.979	MANTRA stands for Movement and Action
222.979	Network for Transformation of Rural Areas.
230.256	So we are speaking about transformation,
230.256	transformation in rural areas.
237.612	Villages that agree 
237.612	to implement this project,
241.224	they organize a legal society
244.087	where the general body 
244.087	consists of all members
248.453	who elect a group of men and women
248.453	who implement the project
254.336	and, later on, who look after
254.336	the operation and maintenance.
259.101	They decide to build a toilet 
259.101	and a shower room.
264.862	And from a protected water source,
267.943	water will be brought to an elevated water
267.943	reservoir and piped to all households
274.862	through three taps:
277.327	one in the toilet, one in the shower, 
277.327	one in the kitchen, 24 hours a day.
284.769	The pity is that our cities,
284.769	like New Delhi and Bombay,
288.94	do not have a 24-hour water supply.
292.371	But in these villages, we want to have it.
297.084	There is a distinct difference 
297.084	in the quality.
301.459	Well in India, we have a theory,
301.459	which is very much accepted
307.328	by the government bureaucracy
307.328	and all those who matter,
310.91	that poor people deserve poor solutions
315.823	and absolutely poor people deserve
315.823	pathetic solutions.
322.058	This, combined with 
322.058	a Nobel Prize-worthy theory that
328.503	the cheapest is the most economic,
330.872	is the heady cocktail that the poor
330.872	are forced to drink.
338.091	We are fighting against this.
340.45	We feel that the poor have been
340.45	humiliated for centuries.
346.941	And even in sanitation,
349.359	they should not be humiliated.
351.545	Sanitation is more about dignity
354.239	than about human disposal of waste.
356.907	And so you build these toilets 
356.907	and very often,
361.236	we have to hear that the toilets are
361.236	better than their houses.
367.442	And you can see that in front are 
367.442	the attached houses
371.323	and the others are the toilets.
374.151	So these people, without a single
374.151	exception of a family in a village,
380.799	decide to build a toilet, a bathing room.
384.598	And for that, they come together,
384.598	collect all the local materials --
390.256	local materials like rubble, 
390.256	sand, aggregates,
395.611	usually a government subsidy is available
398.139	to meet at least part of the cost 
398.139	of external materials
401.417	like cement, steel, toilet commode.
406.211	And they build a toilet 
406.211	and a bathing room.
410.317	Also, all the unskilled laborers, that is 
410.317	daily wage earners, mostly landless,
416.695	are given an opportunity to be 
416.695	trained as masons and plumbers.
424.098	So while these people are being trained, 
424.098	others are collecting the materials.
429.175	And when both are ready,
429.175	they build a toilet, a shower room,
434.841	and of course also a water tower, 
434.841	an elevated water reservoir.
441.84	We use a system of two leach pits 
441.84	to treat the waste.
447.171	From the toilet, the muck comes
447.171	into the first leach pit.
451.469	And when it is full, it is blocked 
451.469	and it can go to the next.
456.494	But we discovered that if you plant
456.494	banana trees, papaya trees
461.343	on the periphery of these leach pits,
464.726	they grow very well
464.726	because they suck up all the nutrients
467.987	and you get very tasty bananas, papayas.
473.478	If any of you come to my place,
476.18	I would be happy to share
476.18	these bananas and papayas with you.
481.478	So there you can see 
481.478	the completed toilets, the water towers.
487.288	This is in a village where 
487.288	most of the people are even illiterate.
493.098	It is always a 24-hour water supply
495.508	because water gets polluted
495.508	very often when you store it --
501.114	a child dips his or her hand into it,
501.114	something falls into it.
506.936	So no water is stored. It's always on tap.
513.288	This is how an elevated 
513.288	water reservoir is constructed.
517.416	And that is the end product.
519.596	Because it has to go high,
519.596	and there is some space available,
524.283	two or three rooms are made
524.283	under the water tower,
527.159	which are used by the village for 
527.159	different committee meetings.
531.801	We have had clear evidence
531.801	of the great impact of this program.
538.675	Before we started, there were, as usual,
542.428	more than 80 percent of people suffering
542.428	from waterborne diseases.
547.858	But after this, we have empirical evidence
547.858	that 82 percent, on average,
554.231	among all these villages --
554.231	1,200 villages have completed it --
558.686	waterborne diseases 
558.686	have come down 82 percent.
563.823	(Applause)
570.073	Women usually used to spend, 
570.073	especially in the summer months,
575.544	about six to seven hours 
575.544	a day carrying water.
583.206	And when they went to carry water,
586.89	because, as I said earlier,
586.89	it's only women who carry water,
592.259	they used to take their little children,
592.259	girl children, also to carry water,
598.834	or else to be back at home
598.834	to look after the siblings.
603.615	So there were less than nine percent
603.615	of girl children attending school,
607.856	even if there was a school.
610.207	And boys, about 30 percent.
613.179	But girls, it has gone to about 90 percent
613.179	and boys, almost to 100 percent.
620.148	(Applause)
624.795	The most vulnerable section in a village
628.027	are the landless laborers who are
628.027	the daily wage-earners.
632.086	Because they have gone 
632.086	through this training
634.696	to be masons and plumbers and bar benders,
638.296	now their ability to earn has 
638.296	increased 300 to 400 percent.
646.325	So this is a democracy in action
649.765	because there is a general body, 
649.765	a governing board, the committee.
653.591	People are questioning, 
653.591	people are governing themselves,
656.461	people are learning to manage
656.461	their own affairs,
659.11	they are taking their own futures
659.11	into their hands.
662.882	And that is democracy at
662.882	the grassroots level in action.
670.831	More than 1,200 villages 
670.831	have so far done this.
677.035	It benefits over 400,000 people
677.035	and it's still going on.
682.614	And I hope it continues to move ahead.
689.245	For India and such developing countries,
694.052	armies and armaments,
699.684	software companies and spaceships
708.486	may not be as important
708.486	as taps and toilets.
714.944	Thank you. Thank you very much.
717.375	(Applause)
721.897	Thank you.
