15.902	People are living longer
15.902	and societies are getting grayer.
20.373	You hear about it all the time.
22.245	You read about it in your newspapers.
24.048	You hear about it on your television sets.
26.418	Sometimes, I'm concerned
27.706	that we hear about it so much
27.706	that we've come to accept longer lives
32.338	with a kind of a complacency, even ease.
37.203	But make no mistake, longer lives can --
41.509	and, I believe, will improve
41.509	quality of life at all ages.
48.956	Now to put this in perspective,
48.956	let me just zoom out for a minute.
53.084	More years were added to average
53.084	life expectancy in the 20th century
60.154	than all years added
60.154	across all prior millennia
67.085	of human evolution combined.
70.535	In the blink of an eye,
72.087	we nearly doubled the length of time
72.087	that we're living.
76.685	So if you ever feel like you don't have
76.685	this aging thing quite pegged,
80.012	don't kick yourself.
81.35	It's brand new.
83.887	And because fertility rates fell
83.887	across that very same period
88.062	that life expectancy was going up,
91.857	that pyramid that has always represented
91.857	the distribution of age in the population,
97.472	with many young ones at the bottom
97.472	winnowed to a tiny peak of older people
102.522	who make it and survive to old age,
104.783	is being reshaped into a rectangle.
110.728	And now, if you're the kind of person
112.56	who can get chills
112.56	from population statistics,
114.941	(Laughter)
115.988	these are the ones that should do it.
117.806	Because what that means
119.26	is that for the first time
119.26	in the history of the species,
123.124	the majority of babies born
123.124	in the developed world
126.918	are having the opportunity to grow old.
132.671	How did this happen?
134.698	Well, we're no genetically hardier
134.698	than our ancestors were 10,000 years ago.
139.238	This increase in life expectancy
139.238	is the remarkable product of culture --
144.082	the crucible that holds
144.082	science and technology
147.799	and wide-scale changes in behavior
147.799	that improve health and well-being.
154.419	Through cultural changes, our ancestors
154.419	largely eliminated early death
160.727	so that people can now
160.727	live out their full lives.
164.784	Now there are problems
164.784	associated with aging --
167.753	diseases, poverty, loss of social status.
170.068	It's hardly time to rest on our laurels.
173.031	But the more we learn about aging,
175.131	the clearer it becomes
175.131	that a sweeping downward course
179.194	is grossly inaccurate.
182.214	Aging brings some rather
182.214	remarkable improvements --
185.506	increased knowledge, expertise --
189.365	and emotional aspects of life improve.
195.64	That's right, older people are happy.
199.788	They're happier than middle-aged people,
199.788	and younger people, certainly.
203.41	(Laughter)
204.616	Study after study
204.616	is coming to the same conclusion.
207.754	The CDC recently conducted a survey
210.61	where they asked respondents
210.61	simply to tell them
213.518	whether they experienced
213.518	significant psychological distress
216.657	in the previous week.
217.843	And fewer older people
217.843	answered affirmatively to that question
221.501	than middle-aged people,
221.501	and younger people as well.
225.126	And a recent Gallup poll
225.126	asked participants
228.115	how much stress and worry and anger
228.115	they had experienced the previous day.
232.918	And stress, worry, anger
237.491	all decrease with age.
240.867	Now social scientists call this
240.867	the paradox of aging.
243.897	I mean, after all,
243.897	aging is not a piece of cake.
247.351	So we've asked all sorts of questions
247.351	to see if we could undo this finding.
252.659	We've asked whether it may be that
252.659	the current generations of older people
258.601	are and always have been
258.601	the greatest generations.
261.869	That is that younger people today
261.869	may not typically experience
265.561	these improvements as they grow older.
268.487	We've asked,
269.835	well, maybe older people
269.835	are just trying to put a positive spin
273.802	on an otherwise depressing existence.
276.239	(Laughter)
278.01	But the more we've tried
278.01	to disavow this finding,
280.887	the more evidence we find to support it.
284.806	Years ago, my colleagues
284.806	and I embarked on a study
287.165	where we followed the same group
287.165	of people over a 10-year period.
290.277	Originally, the sample was aged 18 to 94.
293.754	And we studied whether and how
293.754	their emotional experiences changed
297.117	as they grew older.
299.046	Our participants would carry
299.046	electronic pagers
302.381	for a week at a time,
303.906	and we'd page them throughout the day
303.906	and evenings at random times.
307.229	And every time we paged them,
309.043	we'd ask them to answer
309.043	several questions --
311.119	"""On a one to seven scale,"
311.119	"how happy are you right now?"""
314.208	"""How sad are you right now?"""
315.717	"""How frustrated are you right now?"" --"
317.892	so that we could get a sense of the kinds
317.892	of emotions and feelings they were having
322.15	in their day-to-day lives.
324.309	And using this intense study
324.309	of individuals,
327.627	we find that it's not
327.627	one particular generation
331.505	that's doing better than the others,
333.79	but the same individuals over time
336.688	come to report relatively greater
336.688	positive experience.
341.571	Now you see this slight downturn
341.571	at very advanced ages.
346.033	And there is a slight downturn.
347.694	But at no point does it return
347.694	to the levels we see in early adulthood.
353.888	Now it's really too simplistic
353.888	"to say that older people are ""happy."""
361.929	In our study, they are more positive.
365.088	But they're also more likely
365.088	than younger people
367.429	to experience mixed emotions --
369.626	sadness at the same time
369.626	you experience happiness;
372.267	you know, that tear in the eye
372.267	when you're smiling at a friend.
376.894	And other research has shown that
376.894	older people seem to engage with sadness
381.561	more comfortably.
382.991	They're more accepting of sadness
382.991	than younger people are.
385.899	And we suspect
385.899	that this may help to explain
388.516	why older people are better
388.516	than younger people
391.26	at solving hotly charged
391.26	emotional conflicts and debates.
397.26	Older people can view injustice
397.26	with compassion,
402.22	but not despair.
404.619	And all things being equal,
406.38	older people direct their cognitive
406.38	resources, like attention and memory,
410.495	to positive information
410.495	more than negative.
413.876	If we show older, middle-aged,
413.876	younger people images,
417.252	like the ones you see on the screen,
419.958	and we later ask them
419.958	to recall all the images that they can,
425.145	older people, but not younger people,
427.528	remember more positive images
427.528	than negative images.
431.912	We've asked older and younger people
431.912	to view faces in laboratory studies,
436.074	some frowning, some smiling.
437.974	Older people look toward the smiling faces
437.974	and away from the frowning, angry faces.
444.517	In day-to-day life, this translates
444.517	into greater enjoyment and satisfaction.
451.793	But as social scientists, we continue
451.793	to ask about possible alternatives.
456.106	We've said, well, maybe older people
456.106	report more positive emotions
459.784	because they're cognitively impaired.
462.26	(Laughter)
466.136	We've said, could it be
467.391	that positive emotions are simply easier
467.391	to process than negative emotions,
471.009	and so you switch
471.009	to the positive emotions?
474.202	Maybe our neural centers in our brain
476.361	are degraded such that we're unable
476.361	to process negative emotions anymore.
480.832	But that's not the case.
482.874	The most mentally sharp older adults
486.134	are the ones who show
486.134	this positivity effect the most.
490.209	And under conditions
490.209	where it really matters,
492.515	older people do process
492.515	the negative information
495.067	just as well as the positive information.
497.618	So how can this be?
501.136	Well, in our research,
503.217	we've found that these changes
503.217	are grounded fundamentally
507.232	in the uniquely human
507.232	ability to monitor time --
510.473	not just clock time
510.473	and calendar time, but lifetime.
514.468	And if there's a paradox of aging,
516.93	it's that recognizing
516.93	that we won't live forever
519.956	changes our perspective on life
519.956	in positive ways.
525.464	When time horizons are long and nebulous,
525.464	as they typically are in youth,
530.294	people are constantly preparing,
532.26	trying to soak up all the information
532.26	they possibly can,
536.039	taking risks, exploring.
538.309	We might spend time with people
538.309	we don't even like
541.276	because it's somehow interesting.
543.399	We might learn something unexpected.
545.619	(Laughter)
547.703	We go on blind dates.
549.26	(Laughter)
552.537	You know, after all,
553.731	if it doesn't work out,
553.731	there's always tomorrow.
557.381	People over 50 don't go on blind dates.
559.982	(Laughter)
567.274	As we age, our time horizons grow shorter
567.274	and our goals change.
573.602	When we recognize that we don't have
573.602	all the time in the world,
576.618	we see our priorities most clearly.
579.489	We take less notice of trivial matters.
582.234	We savor life.
584.4	We're more appreciative,
586.042	more open to reconciliation.
588.721	We invest in more emotionally
588.721	important parts of life,
591.575	and life gets better,
594.684	so we're happier day-to-day.
597.565	But that same shift in perspective
599.529	leads us to have less tolerance
599.529	than ever for injustice.
605.321	By 2015,
607.397	there will be more people
607.397	in the United States
610.059	over the age of 60 than under 15.
615.279	What will happen to societies
615.279	that are top-heavy with older people?
620.623	The numbers won't determine the outcome.
624.47	Culture will.
627.463	If we invest in science and technology
630.592	and find solutions for the real problems
630.592	that older people face
635.444	and we capitalize on the very real
635.444	strengths of older people,
642.1	then added years of life can dramatically
642.1	improve quality of life at all ages.
649.157	Societies with millions of talented,
649.157	emotionally stable citizens
653.648	who are healthier and better educated
653.648	than any generations before them,
658.599	armed with knowledge
658.599	about the practical matters of life
662.449	and motivated to solve the big issues
667.556	can be better societies
667.556	than we have ever known.
674.55	My father, who is 92, likes to say,
679.038	"""Let's stop talking"
679.038	only about how to save the old folks
682.71	and start talking about
682.71	"how to get them to save us all."""
689.097	Thank you.
690.561	(Applause)
