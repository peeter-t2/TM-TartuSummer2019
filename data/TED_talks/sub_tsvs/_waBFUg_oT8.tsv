12.797	So, a few years ago I was at JFK Airport
15.578	about to get on a flight,
17.37	when I was approached by two women
19.186	who I do not think would be insulted
20.848	to hear themselves described
22.242	as tiny old tough-talking Italian-American broads.
26.184	The taller one, who is like up here,
29.33	she comes marching up to me, and she goes,
31.381	"""Honey, I gotta ask you something."
33.7	You got something to do with that whole
35.128	"'Eat, Pray, Love' thing that's been going on lately?"""
38.15	"And I said, ""Yes, I did."""
40.264	And she smacks her friend and she goes,
42.052	"""See, I told you, I said, that's that girl."
44.206	That's that girl who wrote that book
46.156	"based on that movie."""
48.19	(Laughter)
50.344	So that's who I am.
52.52	And believe me, I'm extremely
52.52	grateful to be that person,
56.225	"because that whole ""Eat, Pray, Love"" thing"
58.223	was a huge break for me.
59.967	But it also left me in a really tricky position
62.475	moving forward as an author
64.383	trying to figure out how in the world
66.11	I was ever going to write a book again
67.364	that would ever please anybody,
69.209	because I knew well in advance
71.199	that all of those people who
71.199	"had adored ""Eat, Pray, Love"""
74.151	were going to be incredibly disappointed
75.74	in whatever I wrote next
77.123	"because it wasn't going to be ""Eat, Pray, Love,"""
78.951	and all of those people who
78.951	"had hated ""Eat, Pray, Love"""
81.397	were going to be incredibly disappointed
82.765	in whatever I wrote next
84.208	because it would provide evidence that I still lived.
86.661	So I knew that I had no way to win,
89.823	and knowing that I had no way to win
92.279	made me seriously consider for a while
94.183	just quitting the game
95.625	and moving to the country to raise corgis.
99.267	But if I had done that, if I had given up writing,
101.327	I would have lost my beloved vocation,
103.391	so I knew that the task was that I had to find
105.599	some way to gin up the inspiration
107.998	to write the next book
109.43	regardless of its inevitable negative outcome.
111.926	In other words, I had to find a way to make sure
113.534	that my creativity survived its own success.
116.177	And I did, in the end, find that inspiration,
118.6	but I found it in the most unlikely
120.138	and unexpected place.
121.552	I found it in lessons that I had learned earlier in life
124.692	about how creativity can survive its own failure.
127.8	So just to back up and explain,
129.406	the only thing I have ever wanted to be
131.719	for my whole life was a writer.
133.316	I wrote all through childhood,
133.316	all through adolescence,
135.688	by the time I was a teenager I was sending
137.504	my very bad stories to The New Yorker,
139.34	hoping to be discovered.
140.616	After college, I got a job as a diner waitress,
143.06	kept working, kept writing,
145.196	kept trying really hard to get published,
147.444	and failing at it.
149.156	I failed at getting published
150.628	for almost six years.
152.204	So for almost six years, every single day,
153.812	I had nothing but rejection letters
155.468	waiting for me in my mailbox.
157.12	And it was devastating every single time,
158.87	and every single time, I had to ask myself
161.114	if I should just quit while I was behind
163.5	and give up and spare myself this pain.
167.19	But then I would find my resolve,
168.484	and always in the same way,
170.006	"by saying, ""I'm not going to quit,"
172.151	"I'm going home."""
173.972	And you have to understand that for me,
174.92	going home did not mean
174.92	returning to my family's farm.
178.492	For me, going home
180.05	meant returning to the work of writing
181.601	because writing was my home,
183.486	because I loved writing more
183.486	than I hated failing at writing,
186.702	which is to say that I loved writing
188.207	more than I loved my own ego,
189.78	which is ultimately to say
191.184	that I loved writing more than I loved myself.
193.776	And that's how I pushed through it.
195.742	But the weird thing is that 20 years later,
197.606	"during the crazy ride of ""Eat, Pray, Love,"""
199.104	I found myself identifying all over again
201.71	with that unpublished young diner waitress
204.11	who I used to be, thinking about her constantly,
206.278	and feeling like I was her again,
208.136	which made no rational sense whatsoever
209.901	because our lives could not
209.901	have been more different.
211.878	She had failed constantly.
213.326	I had succeeded beyond my wildest expectation.
215.97	We had nothing in common.
217.32	Why did I suddenly feel like I was her all over again?
220.486	And it was only when I was trying to unthread that
222.856	that I finally began to comprehend
224.458	the strange and unlikely psychological connection
226.862	in our lives between the way
226.862	we experience great failure
229.396	and the way we experience great success.
231.632	So think of it like this:
233.102	For most of your life, you live out your existence
234.852	here in the middle of the chain of human experience
237.295	where everything is normal
237.295	and reassuring and regular,
240.373	but failure catapults you abruptly way out over here
243.833	into the blinding darkness of disappointment.
246.767	Success catapults you just as abruptly but just as far
250.321	way out over here
251.689	into the equally blinding glare
253.551	of fame and recognition and praise.
256.403	And one of these fates
257.605	is objectively seen by the world as bad,
259.822	and the other one is objectively
259.822	seen by the world as good,
261.879	but your subconscious is completely incapable
264.527	of discerning the difference between bad and good.
267.255	The only thing that it is capable of feeling
269.396	is the absolute value of this emotional equation,
272.856	the exact distance that you have been flung
275.471	from yourself.
276.839	And there's a real equal danger in both cases
278.895	of getting lost out there
280.441	in the hinterlands of the psyche.
282.465	But in both cases, it turns out that there is
283.998	also the same remedy for self-restoration,
286.822	and that is that you have got to
286.822	find your way back home again
290.42	as swiftly and smoothly as you can,
292.687	and if you're wondering what your home is,
294.159	here's a hint:
295.245	Your home is whatever in this world you love
297.471	more than you love yourself.
299.385	So that might be creativity, it might be family,
301.471	it might be invention, adventure,
303.447	faith, service, it might be raising corgis,
306.239	I don't know, your home is that thing
308.139	to which you can dedicate your energies
309.911	with such singular devotion
311.957	that the ultimate results become inconsequential.
315.359	For me, that home has always been writing.
317.863	So after the weird, disorienting success
320.435	"that I went through with ""Eat, Pray, Love,"""
322.133	I realized that all I had to do was exactly
323.547	the same thing that I used to have to do all the time
325.531	when I was an equally disoriented failure.
327.761	I had to get my ass back to work,
329.539	and that's what I did, and that's how, in 2010,
332.047	I was able to publish the dreaded follow-up
334.401	"to ""Eat, Pray, Love."""
335.289	And you know what happened with that book?
336.865	It bombed, and I was fine.
339.576	Actually, I kind of felt bulletproof,
341.425	because I knew that I had broken the spell
343.545	and I had found my way back home
345.19	to writing for the sheer devotion of it.
347.801	And I stayed in my home of writing after that,
349.937	and I wrote another book that just came out last year
351.769	and that one was really beautifully received,
353.414	which is very nice, but not my point.
354.91	My point is that I'm writing another one now,
357.2	and I'll write another book after that
358.387	and another and another and another
360.217	and many of them will fail,
361.415	and some of them might succeed,
363.043	but I will always be safe
364.639	from the random hurricanes of outcome
367.011	as long as I never forget where I rightfully live.
370.561	Look, I don't know where you rightfully live,
372.963	but I know that there's something in this world
374.633	that you love more than you love yourself.
376.705	Something worthy, by the way,
378.12	so addiction and infatuation don't count,
380.111	because we all know that those
380.111	are not safe places to live. Right?
384.218	The only trick is that you've got to identify
386.265	the best, worthiest thing that you love most,
388.729	and then build your house right on top of it
391.1	and don't budge from it.
392.977	And if you should someday, somehow
395.321	get vaulted out of your home
397.265	by either great failure or great success,
399.705	then your job is to fight your
399.705	way back to that home
401.87	the only way that it has ever been done,
403.655	by putting your head down and performing
405.844	with diligence and devotion
407.666	and respect and reverence
409.352	whatever the task is that love
411.396	is calling forth from you next.
413.476	You just do that, and keep doing that
415.66	again and again and again,
417.309	and I can absolutely promise you,
417.309	from long personal experience
419.965	in every direction, I can assure you
422.22	that it's all going to be okay.
424.29	Thank you.
425.981	(Applause)
