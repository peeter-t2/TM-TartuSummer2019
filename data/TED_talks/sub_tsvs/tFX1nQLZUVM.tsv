12.771	What's the fastest growing threat
12.771	to Americans' health?
16.135	Cancer? Heart attacks? Diabetes?
19.603	The answer is actually none of these;
21.449	it's Alzheimer's disease.
23.25	Every 67 seconds,
25.276	someone in the United States
25.276	is diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
28.761	As the number of Alzheimer's patients
28.761	triples by the year 2050,
32.149	caring for them, as well as
32.149	the rest of the aging population,
35.446	will become an overwhelming
35.446	societal challenge.
38.585	My family has experienced firsthand
40.465	the struggles of caring
40.465	for an Alzheimer's patient.
42.967	Growing up in a family
42.967	with three generations,
45.107	I've always been very close
45.107	to my grandfather.
47.262	When I was four years old,
48.689	my grandfather and I 
48.689	were walking in a park in Japan
51.192	when he suddenly got lost.
52.497	It was one of the scariest moments
52.497	I've ever experienced in my life,
55.71	and it was also the first
55.71	instance that informed us
58.117	that my grandfather
58.117	had Alzheimer's disease.
60.682	Over the past 12 years,
60.682	his condition got worse and worse,
64.025	and his wandering in particular
64.025	caused my family a lot of stress.
67.823	My aunt, his primary caregiver,
69.302	really struggled to stay awake at night
69.302	to keep an eye on him,
72.349	and even then often failed
72.349	to catch him leaving the bed.
75.047	I became really concerned
75.047	about my aunt's well-being
77.858	as well as my grandfather's safety.
79.599	I searched extensively for a solution
79.599	that could help my family's problems,
83.13	but couldn't find one.
84.96	Then, one night about two years ago,
87.693	I was looking after my grandfather
87.693	and I saw him stepping out of the bed.
91.158	The moment his foot landed on the floor,
93.15	I thought, why don't I put
93.15	a pressure sensor on the heel of his foot?
96.412	Once he stepped onto the floor
96.412	and out of the bed,
98.809	the pressure sensor would detect an
98.809	increase in pressure caused by body weight
102.516	and then wirelessly send an audible alert
102.516	to the caregiver's smartphone.
105.971	That way, my aunt could sleep
105.971	much better at night
108.312	without having to worry
108.312	about my grandfather's wandering.
111.002	So now I'd like to perform
111.002	a demonstration of this sock.
117.134	Could I please have
117.134	my sock model on the stage?
120.831	Great.
124.17	So once the patient
124.17	steps onto the floor --
127.95	(Ringing) --
129.51	an alert is sent
129.51	to the caregiver's smartphone.
136.571	Thank you. (Applause)
138.057	Thank you, sock model.
144.045	So this is a drawing
144.045	of my preliminary design.
147.819	My desire to create
147.819	a sensor-based technology
150.441	perhaps stemmed from my lifelong love
150.441	for sensors and technology.
153.979	When I was six years old,
155.465	an elderly family friend
155.465	fell down in the bathroom
157.795	and suffered severe injuries.
159.505	I became concerned
159.505	about my own grandparents
161.606	and decided to invent
161.606	a smart bathroom system.
163.958	Motion sensors would be installed
163.958	inside the tiles of bathroom floors
167.566	to detect the falls of elderly patients
167.566	whenever they fell down in the bathroom.
171.404	Since I was only six years old at the time
173.416	and I hadn't graduated
173.416	from kindergarten yet,
175.739	I didn't have the necessary resources and 
175.739	tools to translate my idea into reality,
180.073	but nonetheless, my research experience
182.706	really implanted in me a firm desire
182.706	to use sensors to help the elderly people.
186.957	I really believe that sensors can improve
186.957	the quality of life of the elderly.
192.944	When I laid out my plan, I realized
192.944	that I faced three main challenges:
196.425	first, creating a sensor;
198.194	second, designing a circuit;
199.773	and third, coding a smartphone app.
201.519	This made me realize that my project
201.519	was actually much harder to realize
204.927	than I initially had thought it to be.
206.982	First, I had to create a wearable sensor
206.982	that was thin and flexible enough
210.476	to be worn comfortably
210.476	on the bottom of the patient's foot.
213.237	After extensive research and testing
213.237	of different materials like rubber,
216.656	which I realized was too thick to be worn
216.656	snugly on the bottom of the foot,
220.191	I decided to print a film sensor
221.758	with electrically conductive
221.758	pressure-sensitive ink particles.
224.66	Once pressure is applied, the connectivity
224.66	between the particles increases.
228.236	Therefore, I could design a circuit
228.236	that would measure pressure
231.2	by measuring electrical resistance.
233.267	Next, I had to design
233.267	a wearable wireless circuit,
236.026	but wireless signal transmission
236.026	consumes lots of power
239.338	and requires heavy, bulky batteries.
241.101	Thankfully, I was able to find out
241.101	about the Bluetooth low energy technology,
244.728	which consumes very little power
244.728	and can be driven by a coin-sized battery.
248.251	This prevented the system
248.251	from dying in the middle of the night.
251.88	Lastly, I had to code a smartphone app
251.88	that would essentially transform
255.343	the care-giver's smartphone
255.343	into a remote monitor.
257.821	For this, I had to expand upon
257.821	my knowledge of coding with Java and XCode
261.497	and I also had to learn about how to code
261.497	for Bluetooth low energy devices
264.984	by watching YouTube tutorials
264.984	and reading various textbooks.
269.23	Integrating these components, I was able
269.23	to successfully create two prototypes,
273.019	one in which the sensor
273.019	is embedded inside a sock,
275.347	and another that's
275.347	a re-attachable sensor assembly
277.743	that can be adhered anywhere
277.743	that makes contact
279.949	with the bottom of the patient's foot.
281.782	I've tested the device on my grandfather
281.782	for about a year now,
284.682	and it's had a 100 percent success rate
286.593	in detecting the over 900 
286.593	known cases of his wandering.
290.629	Last summer, I was able
290.629	to beta test my device
293.052	at several residential
293.052	care facilities in California,
295.598	and I'm currently incorporating
295.598	the feedback
297.77	to further improve the device 
297.77	into a marketable product.
300.733	Testing the device on a number of patients
302.841	made me realize that I needed
302.841	to invent solutions
305.35	for people who didn't want
305.35	to wear socks to sleep at night.
308.805	So sensor data, collected
308.805	on a vast number of patients,
311.63	can be useful for improving patient care
313.959	and also leading to a cure
313.959	for the disease, possibly.
316.777	For example, I'm currently examining 
318.62	correlations between the frequency
318.62	of a patient's nightly wandering
321.848	and his or her daily activities and diet.
325.854	One thing I'll never forget
325.854	is when my device first caught
328.615	my grandfather's wandering
328.615	out of bed at night.
330.833	At that moment, I was really struck
330.833	by the power of technology
333.784	to change lives for the better.
336.011	People living happily and healthfully --
338.131	that's the world that I imagine.
340.156	Thank you very much.
342.216	(Applause)
