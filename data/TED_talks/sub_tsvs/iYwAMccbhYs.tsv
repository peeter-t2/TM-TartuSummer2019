15.26	I'm a filmmaker.
17.26	For the last 8 years,
19.26	I have dedicated my life
21.26	to documenting the work
23.26	of Israelis and Palestinians
25.26	who are trying to end the conflict
27.26	using peaceful means.
29.26	When I travel with my work
31.26	across Europe and the United States,
33.26	one question always comes up:
38.26	Where is the Palestinian Gandhi?
40.26	Why aren't Palestinians
42.26	using nonviolent resistance?
45.26	The challenge I face when I hear this question
48.26	is that often I have just returned from the Middle East
51.26	where I spent my time
53.26	filming dozens of Palestinians
55.26	who are using nonviolence
57.26	to defend their lands
59.26	and water resources
61.26	from Israeli soldiers and settlers.
64.26	These leaders are trying to forge
67.26	a massive national nonviolent movement
70.26	to end the occupation
72.26	and build peace in the region.
74.26	Yet, most of you
76.26	have probably never heard about them.
79.26	This divide between what's happening on the ground
81.26	and perceptions abroad
83.26	is one of the key reasons
85.26	why we don't have yet
87.26	a Palestinian peaceful resistance movement
90.26	that has been successful.
93.26	So I'm here today
95.26	to talk about the power of attention,
97.26	the power of your attention,
100.26	and the emergence and development
102.26	of nonviolent movements
104.26	in the West Bank, Gaza and elsewhere --
107.26	but today, my case study is going to be Palestine.
111.26	I believe that what's mostly missing
113.26	for nonviolence to grow
115.26	is not for Palestinians
117.26	to start adopting nonviolence,
120.26	but for us to start paying attention
123.26	to those who already are.
127.26	Allow me to illustrate this point
129.26	by taking you to this village
131.26	called Budrus.
133.26	About seven years ago,
135.26	they faced extinction,
137.26	because Israel announced it would build a separation barrier,
139.26	and part of this barrier
141.26	would be built on top of the village.
143.26	They would lose 40 percent of their land
145.26	and be surrounded,
147.26	so they would lose free access
149.26	to the rest of the West Bank.
151.26	Through inspired local leadership,
153.26	they launched a peaceful resistance campaign
156.26	to stop that from happening.
158.26	Let me show you some brief clips,
160.26	so you have a sense
162.26	for what that actually looked like on the ground.
165.26	(Music)
171.26	Palestinian Woman: We were told the wall
174.26	would separate Palestine from Israel.
177.26	Here in Budrus,
179.26	we realized the wall would steal our land.
181.26	Israeli Man: The fence has, in fact,
183.26	created a solution to terror.
186.26	Man: Today you're invited
189.26	to a peaceful march.
195.26	You are joined
198.26	by dozens of your Israeli brothers and sisters.
200.26	Israeli Activist: Nothing scares the army
203.26	more than nonviolent opposition.
208.26	Woman: We saw the men
210.26	trying to push the soldiers,
212.26	but none of them could do that.
215.26	But I think the girls could do it.
222.26	Fatah Party Member: We must empty our minds
225.26	of traditional thinking.
230.26	Hamas Party Member: We were in complete harmony,
233.26	and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine.
236.26	Chanting: One united nation.
238.26	Fatah, Hamas and the Popular Front!
242.26	News Anchor: The clashes over the fence continue.
244.26	Reporter: Israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd.
248.26	They were allowed to use any force necessary.
250.26	(Gunshots)
252.26	Man: These are live bullets.
254.26	It's like Fallujah. Shooting everywhere.
257.26	Israeli Activist: I was sure we were all going to die.
260.26	But there were others around me who weren't even cowering.
268.26	Israeli Soldier: A nonviolent protest
270.26	is not going to stop the [unclear].
273.26	Protester: This is a peaceful march.
275.26	There is no need to use violence.
278.26	Chanting: We can do it! We can do it!
282.26	We can do it!
286.26	Julia Bacha: When I first heard
288.26	about the story of Budrus,
290.26	I was surprised
292.26	that the international media had failed to cover
295.26	the extraordinary set of events
297.26	that happened seven years ago,
299.26	in 2003.
301.26	What was even more surprising
303.26	was the fact that Budrus was successful.
306.26	The residents, after 10 months of peaceful resistance,
309.26	convinced the Israeli government
312.26	to move the route of the barrier off their lands
315.26	and to the green line,
317.26	which is the internationally recognized boundary
320.26	between Israel and the Palestinian Territories.
323.26	The resistance in Budrus
325.26	has since spread
327.26	to villages across the West Bank
329.26	and to Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem.
333.26	Yet the media remains mostly silent
336.26	on these stories.
339.26	This silence carries profound consequences
342.26	for the likelihood
344.26	that nonviolence can grow,
346.26	or even survive,
348.26	in Palestine.
350.26	Violent resistance
352.26	and nonviolent resistance
354.26	share one very important thing in common;
358.26	they are both a form of theater
361.26	seeking an audience to their cause.
364.26	If violent actors
366.26	are the only ones constantly getting front-page covers
369.26	and attracting international attention
371.26	to the Palestinian issue,
373.26	it becomes very hard
375.26	for nonviolent leaders
377.26	to make the case to their communities
379.26	that civil disobedience
381.26	is a viable option
383.26	in addressing their plight.
385.26	The power of attention
387.26	is probably going to come as no surprise
389.26	to the parents in the room.
392.26	The surest way
394.26	to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums
397.26	is by giving him attention
399.26	the first time he throws a fit.
401.26	The tantrum will become
403.26	what childhood psychologists call
405.26	a functional behavior,
407.26	since the child has learned
409.26	that he can get parental attention out of it.
413.26	Parents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior
417.26	simply by giving or withdrawing
419.26	attention to their children.
422.26	But that's true for adults too.
425.26	In fact, the behavior
427.26	of entire communities and countries
429.26	can be influenced,
431.26	depending on where
433.26	the international community chooses
435.26	to focus its attention.
438.26	I believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the Middle East
442.26	and bringing peace
444.26	is for us
446.26	to transform nonviolence
448.26	into a functional behavior
450.26	by giving a lot more attention
452.26	to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today.
456.26	In the course of taking my film to villages
459.26	in the West Bank, in Gaza and in East Jerusalem,
462.26	I have seen the impact
464.26	that even one documentary film can have
467.26	in influencing the transformation.
471.26	In a village called Wallajeh,
473.26	which sits very close to Jerusalem,
476.26	the community was facing
478.26	a very similar plight to Budrus.
480.26	They were going to be surrounded, lose a lot of their lands
483.26	and not have freedom of access,
485.26	either to the West Bank or Jerusalem.
488.26	They had been using nonviolence for about two years
491.26	but had grown disenchanted
493.26	since nobody was paying attention.
496.26	So we organized a screening.
499.26	A week later,
501.26	they held the most well-attended
503.26	and disciplined
505.26	demonstration to date.
508.26	The organizers say
510.26	that the villagers, upon seeing the story of Budrus
512.26	documented in a film,
514.26	felt that there were indeed people
516.26	following what they were doing,
518.26	that people cared.
520.26	So they kept on going.
522.26	On the Israeli side,
524.26	there is a new peace movement called Solidariot,
527.26	which means solidarity in Hebrew.
530.26	The leaders of this movement have been using Budrus
533.26	as one of their primary recruiting tools.
536.26	They report
538.26	that Israelis who had never been active before,
540.26	upon seeing the film,
542.26	understand the power of nonviolence
544.26	and start joining their activities.
546.26	The examples of Wallajeh
548.26	and the Solidariot movement
550.26	show that even a small-budget independent film
554.26	can play a role
556.26	in transforming nonviolence
558.26	into a functional behavior.
561.26	Now imagine the power
563.26	that big media players could have
566.26	if they started covering
568.26	the weekly nonviolent demonstrations
570.26	happening in villages
572.26	like Bil'in, Ni'lin,
574.26	Wallajeh,
576.26	in Jerusalem neighborhoods
578.26	like Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan --
581.26	the nonviolent leaders
583.26	would become more visible,
585.26	valued and effective
587.26	in their work.
590.26	I believe
592.26	that the most important thing
594.26	is to understand
596.26	that if we don't pay attention to these efforts,
599.26	they are invisible,
601.26	and it's as if they never happened.
603.26	But I have seen first hand
605.26	that if we do,
607.26	they will multiply.
609.26	If they multiply,
611.26	their influence will grow
613.26	in the overall Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
615.26	And theirs is the kind of influence
618.26	that can finally
620.26	unblock the situation.
622.26	These leaders have proven that nonviolence works
625.26	in places like Budrus.
627.26	Let's give them attention
629.26	so they can prove it works everywhere.
632.26	Thank you.
634.26	(Applause)
