12.849	For the past decade,
14.344	I've been studying non-state armed groups:
17.27	armed organizations like terrorists,
17.27	insurgents or militias.
21.588	I document what these groups do
21.588	when they're not shooting.
24.785	My goal is to better understand
24.785	these violent actors
28.372	and to study ways to encourage transition
28.372	from violent engagement
32.086	to nonviolent confrontation.
33.987	I work in the field, in the policy world
33.987	and in the library.
37.749	Understanding non-state armed groups
37.749	is key to solving most ongoing conflict,
42.884	because war has changed.
44.464	It used to be a contest between states.
47.568	No longer.
48.743	It is now a conflict between states
48.743	and non-state actors.
53.236	For example, of the 216 peace agreements
56.996	signed between 1975 and 2011,
	and a non-state actor.
65.634	So we need to understand these groups;
65.634	we need to either engage them
68.895	or defeat them in any conflict resolution
68.895	process that has to be successful.
73.808	So how do we do that?
75.805	We need to know what makes
75.805	these organizations tick.
79.148	We know a lot about
79.148	how they fight, why they fight,
81.965	but no one looks at what they're doing
81.965	when they're not fighting.
85.043	Yet, armed struggle
85.043	and unarmed politics are related.
88.659	It is all part of the same organization.
90.981	We cannot understand these groups,
90.981	let alone defeat them,
94.162	if we don't have the full picture.
97.14	And armed groups today
97.14	are complex organizations.
100.222	Take the Lebanese Hezbollah,
102.149	known for its violent
102.149	confrontation against Israel.
104.956	But since its creation in the early 1980s,
107.815	Hezbollah has also set up
107.815	a political party,
110.424	a social-service network,
110.424	and a military apparatus.
113.765	Similarly, the Palestinian Hamas,
116.415	known for its suicide attacks
116.415	against Israel,
119.006	also runs the Gaza Strip since 2007.
122.234	So these groups do way more
122.234	than just shoot.
125.453	They multi-task.
127.239	They set up complex
127.239	communication machines --
130.278	radio stations, TV channels,
132.445	Internet websites
132.445	and social media strategies.
135.422	And up here, you have the ISIS magazine,
137.738	printed in English
137.738	and published to recruit.
141.259	Armed groups also invest
141.259	in complex fund-raising --
144.19	not looting, but setting up
144.19	profitable businesses;
148.077	for example, construction companies.
150.491	Now, these activities are keys.
152.398	They allow these groups
152.398	to increase their strength,
154.842	increase their funds,
156.221	to better recruit
156.221	and to build their brand.
159.537	Armed groups also do something else:
161.3	they build stronger bonds
161.3	with the population
163.984	by investing in social services.
166.457	They build schools, they run hospitals,
169.324	they set up vocational-training programs
169.324	or micro-loan programs.
173.104	Hezbollah offers all
173.104	of these services and more.
176.905	Armed groups also seek
176.905	to win the population over
179.738	by offering something
179.738	that the state is not providing:
183.662	safety and security.
186.141	The initial rise of the Taliban
186.141	in war-torn Afghanistan,
190.125	or even the beginning
190.125	of the ascent of ISIS,
193.026	can be understood also by looking
193.026	at these groups' efforts
196.108	to provide security.
198.348	Now, unfortunately, in these cases,
200.643	the provision of security
200.643	came at an unbearably high price
203.913	for the population.
205.347	But in general, providing
205.347	social services fills a gap,
209.612	a governance gap left by the government,
211.897	and allows these groups
211.897	to increase their strength
214.516	and their power.
216.04	For example, the 2006 electoral victory
216.04	of the Palestinian Hamas
220.47	cannot be understood without
220.47	acknowledging the group's social work.
224.696	Now, this is a really complex picture,
227.094	yet in the West,
227.094	when we look at armed groups,
229.595	we only think of the violent side.
231.821	But that's not enough to understand
231.821	these groups' strength,
234.717	strategy or long-term vision.
237.393	These groups are hybrid.
238.977	They rise because they fill a gap
238.977	left by the government,
242.325	and they emerge
242.325	to be both armed and political,
245.729	engage in violent struggle
245.729	and provide governance.
249.431	And the more these organizations
249.431	are complex and sophisticated,
253.463	the less we can think of them
253.463	as the opposite of a state.
256.828	Now, what do you call
256.828	a group like Hezbollah?
259.131	They run part of a territory,
259.131	they administer all their functions,
262.47	they pick up the garbage,
262.47	they run the sewage system.
265.628	Is this a state? Is it a rebel group?
268.72	Or maybe something else,
268.72	something different and new?
272.081	And what about ISIS?
273.786	The lines are blurred.
275.08	We live in a world of states,
275.08	non-states, and in-between,
278.862	and the more states are weak,
278.862	like in the Middle East today,
282.299	the more non-state actors
282.299	step in and fill that gap.
285.799	This matters for governments,
285.799	because to counter these groups,
288.949	they will have to invest more
288.949	in non-military tools.
293.202	Filling that governance gap
294.697	has to be at the center
294.697	of any sustainable approach.
298.15	This also matters very much
298.15	for peacemaking and peacebuilding.
301.813	If we better understand armed groups,
303.868	we will better know
303.868	what incentives to offer
306.354	to encourage the transition
306.354	from violence to nonviolence.
310.487	So in this new contest
310.487	between states and non-states,
314.155	military power can win some battles,
316.831	but it will not give us
316.831	peace nor stability.
320.085	To achieve these objectives,
321.957	what we need is a long-term investment
321.957	in filling that security gap,
326.786	in filling that governance gap
328.811	that allowed these groups
328.811	to thrive in the first place.
332.22	Thank you.
333.395	(Applause)
