15.26	My travels to Afghanistan
18.26	began many, many years ago
21.26	on the eastern border of my country,
24.26	my homeland, Poland.
27.26	I was walking through the forests
29.26	of my grandmother's tales.
33.26	A land where every field hides a grave,
38.26	where millions of people
40.26	have been deported or killed
43.26	in the 20th century.
46.26	Behind the destruction,
48.26	I found a soul of places.
51.26	I met humble people.
53.26	I heard their prayer
55.26	and ate their bread.
57.26	Then I have been walking East for 20 years --
62.26	from Eastern Europe to Central Asia --
65.26	through the Caucasus Mountains,
67.26	Middle East,
69.26	North Africa,
71.26	Russia.
73.26	And I ever met more humble people.
77.26	And I shared their bread and their prayer.
80.26	This is why I went to Afghanistan.
83.26	One day, I crossed the bridge
87.26	over the Oxus River.
89.26	I was alone on foot.
91.26	And the Afghan soldier was so surprised to see me
93.26	that he forgot to stamp my passport.
96.26	But he gave me a cup of tea.
98.26	And I understood
100.26	that his surprise was my protection.
103.26	So I have been walking and traveling,
106.26	by horses, by yak, by truck, by hitchhiking,
109.26	from Iran's border
111.26	to the bottom, to the edge of the Wakhan Corridor.
116.26	And in this way
118.26	I could find noor, the hidden light of Afghanistan.
125.26	My only weapon
127.26	was my notebook and my Leica.
132.26	I heard prayers of the Sufi --
134.26	humble Muslims,
136.26	hated by the Taliban.
138.26	Hidden river,
140.26	interconnected with the mysticism
142.26	from Gibraltar to India.
145.26	The mosque where the respectful foreigner
150.26	is showered with blessings
152.26	and with tears,
155.26	and welcomed as a gift.
159.26	What do we know
161.26	about the country and the people
163.26	that we pretend to protect,
166.26	about the villages
169.26	where the only one medicine
171.26	to kill the pain and to stop the hunger
173.26	is opium?
175.26	These are opium-addicted people
178.26	on the roofs of Kabul
185.26	These are the nomad girls
188.26	who became prostitutes for Afghan businessmen.
192.26	What do we know about the women
196.26	Clothed in this nylon bag,
198.26	made in China,
200.26	with the name of burqa.
204.26	I saw one day,
206.26	the largest school in Afghanistan,
209.26	a girls' school.
214.26	studying here
218.26	in the rooms underground,
221.26	full of scorpions.
224.26	And their love [for studying]
227.26	was so big that I cried.
232.26	What do we know
234.26	about the death threats by the Taliban
237.26	nailed on the doors
239.26	of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in Balkh?
245.26	The region is not secure, but full of the Taliban,
248.26	and they did it.
250.26	My aim is to give a voice
252.26	to the silent people,
255.26	to show the hidden lights
259.26	behind the curtain of the great game,
262.26	the small worlds ignored by the media
265.26	and the prophets of a global conflict.
267.26	Thanks.
269.26	(Applause)
