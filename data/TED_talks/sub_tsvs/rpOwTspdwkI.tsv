12.846	The world is changing
14.149	in some really profound ways,
16.861	and I worry that investors
18.844	aren't paying enough attention
20.578	to some of the biggest drivers of change,
22.443	especially when it comes to sustainability.
26.219	And by sustainability, I mean the really juicy things,
29.674	like environmental and social issues
31.577	and corporate governance.
34.086	I think it's reckless to ignore these things,
36.352	because doing so can jeopardize
37.998	future long-term returns.
40.467	And here's something that may surprise you:
42.663	the balance of power to really influence sustainability
47.334	rests with institutional investors,
49.489	the large investors like pension funds,
52.525	foundations and endowments.
55.481	I believe that sustainable investing
57.075	is less complicated than you think,
59.725	better-performing than you believe,
61.753	and more important than we can imagine.
64.626	Let me remind you what we already know.
67.634	We have a population that's both growing and aging;
71.18	we have seven billion souls today
73.026	heading to 10 billion
74.452	at the end of the century;
76.353	we consume natural resources
78.851	faster than they can be replenished;
81.677	and the emissions that are mainly responsible
84.114	for climate change just keep increasing.
88.943	Now clearly, these are
88.943	environmental and social issues,
93.16	but that's not all.
95.092	They're economic issues,
97.064	and that makes them relevant
98.8	to risk and return.
102.077	And they are really complex
104.157	and they can seem really far off,
105.822	that the temptation may be to do this:
109.108	bury our heads in the sand and not think about it.
112.474	Resist this, if you can. Don't do this at home.
115.124	(Laughter)
117.05	But it makes me wonder
118.693	if the investment rules of today
120.706	are fit for purpose tomorrow.
123.951	We know that investors,
125.789	when they look at a company
125.789	and decide whether to invest,
128.649	they look at financial data,
130.281	metrics like sales growth, cash flow, market share,
134.301	valuation -- you know, the really sexy stuff.
139.713	And these things are fundamental, of course,
142.04	but they're not enough.
143.805	Investors should also look at performance metrics
146.254	in what we call ESG:
148.178	environment, social and governance.
151.02	Environment includes energy consumption,
155.782	water availability, waste and pollution,
161.166	just making efficient uses of resources.
164.985	Social includes human capital,
167.112	things like employee engagement
168.98	and innovation capacity,
171.324	as well as supply chain management
174.636	and labor rights and human rights.
178.206	And governance relates to the oversight
180.014	of companies by their boards and investors.
183.795	See, I told you this is the really juicy stuff.
186.906	But ESG is the measure of sustainability,
191.093	and sustainable investing incorporates ESG factors
195.234	with financial factors into the investment process.
199.351	It means limiting future risk
201.479	by minimizing harm to people and planet,
205.088	and it means providing capital to users
208.703	who deploy it towards productive
210.863	and sustainable outcomes.
213.587	So if sustainability matters financially today,
216.751	and all signs indicate more tomorrow,
219.243	is the private sector paying attention?
222.741	Well, the really cool thing is that most CEOs are.
228.722	They started to see sustainability
230.288	not just as important but crucial to business success.
234.532	About 80 percent of global CEOs
236.946	see sustainability as the root to growth in innovation
241.037	and leading to competitive advantage
243.43	in their industries.
245.154	But 93 percent see ESG as the future,
248.327	or as important to the future of their business.
251.376	So the views of CEOs are clear.
254.593	There's tremendous opportunity in sustainability.
257.78	So how are companies actually leveraging ESG
261.308	to drive hard business results?
264.11	One example is near and dear to our hearts.
266.631	In 2012, State Street migrated 54 applications
270.065	to the cloud environment,
271.711	and we retired another 85.
274.14	We virtualized our operating system environments,
276.846	and we completed numerous automation projects.
280.309	Now these initiatives create
280.309	a more mobile workplace,
282.841	and they reduce our real estate footprint,
285.625	and they yield savings of 23 million dollars
288.265	in operating costs annually,
291.265	and avoid the emissions
293.101	of a 100,000 metric tons of carbon.
297.551	That's the equivalent of taking 21,000 cars
300.584	off the road.
302.373	So awesome, right?
305.012	Another example is Pentair.
307.976	Pentair is a U.S. industrial conglomerate,
310.305	and about a decade ago,
311.885	they sold their core power tools business
314.372	and reinvested those proceeds in a water business.
318.63	That's a really big bet. Why did they do that?
322.593	Well, with apologies to the Home Improvement fans,
325.321	there's more growth in water than in power tools,
328.243	and this company has their sights set
330.165	"on what they call ""the new New World."""
332.532	That's four billion middle class people
334.915	demanding food, energy and water.
340.069	Now, you may be asking yourself,
343.193	are these just isolated cases?
344.859	I mean, come on, really?
346.837	Do companies that take sustainability into account
348.846	really do well financially?
351.032	The answer that may surprise you is yes.
353.878	The data shows that stocks
353.878	with better ESG performance
357.043	perform just as well as others.
360.39	In blue, we see the MSCI World.
362.664	It's an index of large companies
364.101	from developed markets across the world.
366.89	And in gold, we see a subset of companies
369.362	rated as having the best ESG performance.
372.145	Over three plus years, no performance tradeoff.
376.396	So that's okay, right? We want more. I want more.
380.807	In some cases, there may be outperformance
383.37	from ESG.
385.953	In blue, we see the performance
388.131	of the 500 largest global companies,
390.546	and in gold, we see a subset of companies
393.859	with best practice in climate change strategy
396.682	and risk management.
398.115	Now over almost eight years,
399.545	they've outperformed by about two thirds.
402.555	So yes, this is correlation. It's not causation.
406.449	But it does illustrate that environmental leadership
408.978	is compatible with good returns.
412.051	So if the returns are the same or better
416.394	and the planet benefits, wouldn't this be the norm?
419.505	Are investors, particularly institutional investors,
422.636	engaged?
424.075	Well, some are,
425.952	and a few are really at the vanguard.
429.288	Hesta.
430.527	Hesta is a retirement fund for health
432.774	and community services employees in Australia,
435.469	with assets of 22 billion [dollars].
437.714	They believe that ESG has the potential
439.537	to impact risks and returns,
441.605	so incorporating it into the investment process
444.897	is core to their duty
447.113	to act in the best interest of fund members,
449.271	core to their duty.
450.957	You gotta love the Aussies, right?
454.668	CalPERS is another example.
457.176	CalPERS is the pension fund
459.197	for public employees in California,
461.478	and with assets of 244 billion [dollars],
464.194	they are the second largest in the U.S.
466.286	and the sixth largest in the world.
468.983	Now, they're moving toward 100 percent
470.546	sustainable investment
472.135	by systematically integrated ESG
474.217	across the entire fund.
476.966	Why? They believe it's critical
480.423	to superior long-term returns, full stop.
484.954	"In their own words, ""long-term value creation"
487.546	requires the effective management
489.586	of three forms of capital:
491.728	financial, human, and physical.
496.447	"This is why we are concerned with ESG."""
500.306	Now, I do speak to a lot of investors
502.714	as part of my job,
504.441	and not all of them see it this way.
506.735	"Often I hear, ""We are required to maximize returns,"
510.493	"so we don't do that here,"""
512.243	"or, ""We don't want to use the portfolio"
514.59	"to make policy statements."""
517.094	The one that just really gets under my skin is,
519.96	"""If you want to do something about that,"
522.012	"just make money, give the profits to charities."""
525.475	It's eyes rolling, eyes rolling.
529.244	I mean, let me clarify something right here.
533.267	Companies and investors are not
535.872	singularly responsible for the fate of the planet.
538.631	They don't have indefinite social obligations,
541.019	and prudent investing and finance theory
543.792	aren't subordinate to sustainability.
545.891	They're compatible.
547.547	So I'm not talking about tradeoffs here.
552.012	But institutional investors
553.989	are the x-factor in sustainability.
557.155	Why do they hold the key?
559.218	The answer, quite simply, is, they have the money.
562.933	(Laughter)
565.619	A lot of it.
568.015	I mean, a really lot of it.
569.757	The global stock market is worth 55 trillion dollars.
572.6	The global bond market, 78 trillion.
575.658	That's 133 trillion combined.
580.836	That's eight and a half times the GDP of the U.S.
583.507	That's the world's largest economy.
585.726	That's some serious freaking firepower.
589.563	So we can reconsider
591.612	some of these pressing challenges,
593.535	like fresh water, clean air,
596.049	feeding 10 billion mouths,
598.074	if institutional investors
599.751	integrated ESG into investment.
602.163	What if they used that firepower
604.314	to allocate more of their capital
606.358	to companies working the hardest
607.771	at solving these challenges
609.853	or at least not exacerbating them?
612.969	What if we work and save and invest,
617.806	only to find that the world we retire into
620.439	is more stressed and less secure than it is now?
624.165	What if there isn't enough clean air and fresh water?
629.037	Now a fair question might be,
631.525	what if all this sustainability risk stuff
633.421	is exaggerated, overstated, it's not urgent,
637.957	something for virtuous consumers
640.11	or lifestyle choice?
642.066	Well, President John F. Kennedy said something
644.805	about this that is just spot on:
648.29	"""There are risks and costs to a program of action,"
652.102	but they are far less than the long-range risks
654.751	"and costs of comfortable inaction."""
659.366	I can appreciate that there is estimation risk in this,
662.984	but since this is based on
662.984	widespread scientific consensus,
666.619	the odds that it's not completely wrong
669.18	are better than the odds
670.796	that our house will burn down
672.471	or we'll get in a car accident.
674.406	Well, maybe not if you live in Boston. (Laughter)
678	But my point is that we buy insurance
681.303	to protect ourselves financially
683.286	in case those things happen, right?
686.489	So by investing sustainably
688.038	we're doing two things.
690.257	We're creating insurance,
692.415	reducing the risk to our planet and to our economy,
696.661	and at the same time, in the short term,
698.65	we're not sacrificing performance.
701.326	"[Man in comic: ""What if it's a big hoax "
701.326	"and we create a better world for nothing?""]"
706.083	Good, you like it. I like it too.
708.199	(Laughter)
709.776	I like it because it pokes fun
711.849	at both sides of the climate change issue.
714.444	I bet you can't guess which side I'm on.
717.788	But what I really like about it
719.527	is that it reminds me of something Mark Twain said,
722.456	"which is, ""Plan for the future,"
724.525	because that's where you're going to spend
726.095	"the rest of your life."""
728.596	Thank you.
730.955	(Applause)
