12.577	Almost two years ago,
14.432	I was driving in my car in Germany,
16.823	and I turned on the radio.
19.339	Europe at the time was in the middle
21.546	of the Euro crisis,
22.989	and all the headlines were about European countries
27.235	getting downgraded by rating agencies
30.076	in the United States.
31.93	I listened and thought to myself,
34.039	"""What are these rating agencies,"
36.111	"and why is everybody so upset about their work?"""
39.564	Well, if you were sitting
41.616	next to me in the car that day
43.377	and would have told me that I would devote
45.939	the next years to trying to reform them,
49.183	obviously I would have called you crazy.
53.131	But guess what's really crazy:
55.033	the way these rating agencies are run.
58.062	And I would like to explain to you
59.705	not only why it's time to change this,
61.806	but also how we can do it.
64.984	So let me tell you a little bit
66.638	about what rating agencies really do.
70.216	As you would read a car magazine
72.6	before purchasing a new car
74.402	or taking a look at a product review
76.494	before deciding which kind of tablet or phone to get,
80.371	investors are reading ratings
82.571	before they decide in which kind of product
85.884	they are investing their money.
87.972	A rating can range from a so-called AAA,
90.783	which means it's a top-performing product,
93.726	and it can go down to the level
96.253	of the so-called BBB-,
99.267	which means it's a fairly risky investment.
102.692	Rating agencies are rating companies.
105.253	They are rating banks.
106.503	They are rating even financial products
108.867	like the infamous mortgage-backed securities.
111.942	But they can also rate countries,
114.019	and these ratings are called sovereign ratings,
116.767	and I would like to focus in particular
119.124	on these sovereign ratings.
121.75	And I can tell, as you're listening to me right now,
124.156	you're thinking,
125.615	so why should I really care about this, right?
128.223	Be honest.
129.808	Well, ratings affect you.
132.097	They affect all of us.
134.259	If a rating agency rates a country,
137.564	it basically assesses and evaluates
140.839	a country's debt
142.24	and the ability and willingness of a country
144.589	to repay its debt.
146.93	So if a country gets downgraded by a rating agency,
149.863	the country has to pay more
151.94	in order to borrow money
153.547	on the international markets.
155.108	So it affects you as a citizen and as a taxpayer,
157.909	because you and your fellow countrymen
160.272	have to pony up more in order to borrow.
164.062	But what if a country can't afford to pay more
166.878	because it's maybe too expensive?
169.715	Well, then the country has less available
172.65	for other services, like roads, schools, healthcare.
176.312	And this is the reason why you should care,
178.751	because sovereign ratings affect everyone.
181.797	And that is the reason why I believe
183.458	they should be defined as public goods.
186.414	They should be transparent, accessible,
189.226	and available to everyone at no cost.
193.807	But here's the situation:
195.853	the rating agency market is dominated
197.997	by three players and three players only --
200.97	Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch --
203.749	and we know whenever there
203.749	is a market concentration,
206.706	there is really no competition.
208.505	There is no incentive to improve
210.782	the quality of your product.
213.099	And let's face it, the credit rating 
213.099	agencies have contributed,
217.348	putting the global economy on the brink,
220.193	and yet they have to change the way they operate.
223.978	The second point,
225.851	would you really buy a car
227.873	just based on the advice of the dealer?
231.359	Obviously not, right? That would be irresponsible.
234.372	But that's actually what's going on
236.965	in the rating agency sector every single day.
240.843	The customers of these rating agencies,
243.592	like countries or companies,
246.079	they are paying for their own ratings,
248.505	and obviously this is creating
250.503	a conflict of interest.
253.374	The third point is,
255.89	the rating agencies are not really telling us
258.805	how they are coming up with their ratings,
261.443	but in this day and age,
263.283	you can't even sell a candy bar
265.159	without listing everything that's inside.
268.207	But for ratings, a crucial element of our economy,
271.891	we really do not know
273.56	what all the different ingredients are.
276.042	We are allowing the rating agencies
277.988	to be intransparent about their work,
280.69	and we need to change this.
282.752	I think there is no doubt that the sector
285.232	needs a complete overhaul,
286.949	not just a trimming at the margins.
289.459	I think it's time for a bold move.
291.682	I think it's time to upgrade the system.
294.798	And this is why we at the Bertelsmann Foundation
297.36	have invested a lot of time and effort
300.182	thinking about an alternative for the sector.
303.913	And we have developed the first model
306.512	for a nonprofit rating agency for sovereign risk,
311.67	and we call it by its acronym, INCRA.
316.126	INCRA would make a difference
317.524	to the current system
319.951	by adding another nonprofit player to the mix.
324.153	It would be based on a nonprofit model
327.602	that would be based on a sustainable endowment.
331.246	The endowment would create income
333.37	that would allow us to run the operation,
335.787	to run the rating agency,
337.489	and it would also allow us
339.539	to make our ratings publicly available.
343.224	But this is not enough to make a difference, right?
345.927	INCRA would also be based on
347.8	a very, very clear governance structure
350.378	that would avoid any conflict of interest,
353.3	and it would include many stakeholders from society.
358.169	INCRA would not only be a European
360.718	or an American rating agency,
362.849	it would be a truly international one,
365.213	in which, in particular, the emerging economies
368.33	would have an equal interest, 
368.33	voice and representation.
373.454	The second big difference that INCRA would make is
376.884	that would it base its sovereign risk assessment
379.862	on a broader set of indicators.
382.558	Think about it that way.
384.459	If we conduct a sovereign rating,
386.303	we basically take a look at
387.92	the economic soil of a country,
390.587	its macroeconomic fundamentals.
393.172	But we also have to ask the question,
395.35	who is cultivating the economic soil
398.266	of a country, right?
400.186	Well, a country has many gardeners,
402.346	and one of them is the government,
404.164	so we have to ask the question,
406.209	how is a country governed?
407.523	How is it managed?
409.109	And this is the reason why we have developed
411.279	what we call forward-looking indicators.
414.37	These are indicators that give you
416.037	a much better read about
417.544	the socioeconomic development of a country.
421.095	I hope you would agree it's important for you to know
423.853	if your government is willing to invest 
423.853	in renewable energy and education.
431.034	It's important for you to know
432.759	if the government of your country
434.762	is able to manage a crisis,
436.724	if the government is finally able to implement
439.705	the reforms that it's promised.
443.433	For example, if INCRA would rate
445.3	South Africa right now,
447.254	of course we would take a very, very close look
450.711	at the youth unemployment of the country,
453.011	the highest in the world.
455.549	If over 70 percent of a country's population
458.993	under the age of 35 is unemployed,
462.584	of course this has a huge impact on the economy
465.68	today and even more so in the future.
469.974	Well, our friends at Moody's,
472.249	Standard &amp; Poor's, and Fitch will tell us
474.572	we would take this into account as well.
477.605	But guess what? We do not know
479.554	exactly how they will take this into account.
482.571	And this leads me to the third big difference
484.922	that INCRA would make.
486.626	INCRA would not only release its ratings
489.42	but it would also release its indicators
492.391	and methodology.
494.053	So in contrast to the current system,
496.616	INCRA would be fully transparent.
500.131	So in a nutshell,
501.97	INCRA would offer an alternative
504.172	to the current system of
504.172	the big three rating agencies
507.598	by adding a new, nonprofit player to the mix
511.563	that would increase the competition,
513.967	it would increase the transparency of the sector,
516.53	and it would also increase the quality.
519.335	I can tell that sovereign ratings
521.303	may still look to you like this very small piece
524.527	of this very complex global financial world,
528.802	but I tell you it's a very important one,
531.242	and a very important one to fix,
533.684	because sovereign ratings affect all of us,
536.827	and they should be addressed and should be defined
540.365	as public goods.
541.825	And this is why we are testing our model right now,
544.709	and why we are trying to find out if it can
547.636	bring together a group of able and willing actors
550.839	to bring INCRA to life.
553.489	I truly believe building up INCRA
556.1	is in everyone's interest,
558.491	and that we have the unique opportunity right now
562.061	to turn INCRA into a cornerstone
564.63	of a new, more inclusive financial system.
569.025	Because for way too long,
571.593	we have left the big financial players on their own.
575.285	It's time to give them some company.
578.081	Thank you.
580.115	(Applause)
