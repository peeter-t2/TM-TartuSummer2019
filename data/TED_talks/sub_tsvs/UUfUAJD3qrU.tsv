12	It's a great honor to be here with you.
15	The good news is
18	I'm very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of here
21	because I'm the only thing standing between you and the bar.
25	(Laughter)
28	And the good news is I don't have a prepared speech,
31	but I have a box of slides.
33	I have some pictures that represent my life and what I do for a living.
39	I've learned through experience
42	that people remember pictures long after they've forgotten words,
47	and so I hope you'll remember some of the pictures
50	I'm going to share with you for just a few minutes.
56	The whole story really starts
58	with me as a high school kid in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
62	in a tough neighborhood that everybody gave up on for dead.
65	And on a Wednesday afternoon,
68	I was walking down the corridor of my high school
72	kind of minding my own business. And there was this artist teaching,
78	who made a great big old ceramic vessel,
80	and I happened to be looking in the door of the art room --
83	and if you've ever seen clay done, it's magic --
85	and I'd never seen anything like that before in my life.
90	"So, I walked in the art room and I said, ""What is that?"""
94	"And he said, ""Ceramics. And who are you?"""
96	"And I said, ""I'm Bill Strickland. I want you to teach me that."""
99	"And he said, ""Well, get your homeroom teacher to sign a piece of paper"
103	"that says you can come here, and I'll teach it to you."""
106	And so for the remaining two years of my high school,
109	I cut all my classes.
110	(Laughter)
111	But I had the presence of mind
113	to give the teachers' classes that I cut the pottery that I made,
117	(Laughter)
118	and they gave me passing grades.
121	And that's how I got out of high school.
124	And Mr. Ross said,
126	"""You're too smart to die and I don't want it on my conscience,"
131	"so I'm leaving this school and I'm taking you with me."""
133	And he drove me out to the University of Pittsburgh
136	where I filled out a college application and got in on probation.
140	Well, I'm now a trustee of the university,
143	and at my installation ceremony I said,
147	"""I'm the guy who came from the neighborhood"
151	who got into the place on probation.
154	Don't give up on the poor kids, because you never know
157	"what's going to happen to those children in life."""
161	What I'm going to show you for a couple of minutes
164	is a facility that I built in the toughest neighborhood in Pittsburgh
169	with the highest crime rate.
171	One is called Bidwell Training Center; it is a vocational school
176	for ex-steel workers and single parents and welfare mothers.
180	You remember we used to make steel in Pittsburgh?
182	Well, we don't make any steel anymore,
184	and the people who used to make the steel
186	are having a very tough time of it.
189	And I rebuild them and give them new life.
192	Manchester Craftsmen's Guild is named after my neighborhood.
196	I was adopted
199	by the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese during the riots,
202	and he donated a row house. And in that row house
205	I started Manchester Craftsmen's Guild,
207	and I learned very quickly that wherever there are Episcopalians,
213	there's money in very close proximity.
215	(Laughter)
219	And the Bishop adopted me as his kid.
224	And last year I spoke at his memorial service
228	and wished him well in this life.
232	I went out and hired a student of Frank Lloyd Wright, the architect,
238	and I asked him to build me a world class center
241	in the worst neighborhood in Pittsburgh.
244	And my building was a scale model for the Pittsburgh airport.
248	And when you come to Pittsburgh -- and you're all invited --
250	you'll be flying into the blown-up version of my building.
254	That's the building.
256	Built in a tough neighborhood where people have been given up for dead.
261	My view is that if you want to involve yourself
264	in the life of people who have been given up on,
267	you have to look like the solution and not the problem.
272	As you can see, it has a fountain in the courtyard.
275	And the reason it has a fountain in the courtyard is I wanted one
279	and I had the checkbook, so I bought one and put it there.
282	(Laughter)
283	And now that I'm giving speeches at conferences like TED,
286	I got put on the board of the Carnegie Museum.
290	At a reception in their courtyard, I noticed that they had a fountain
295	because they think that the people who go to the museum deserve a fountain.
300	Well, I think that welfare mothers and at-risk kids
304	and ex-steel workers deserve a fountain in their life.
307	And so the first thing that you see in my center in the springtime
310	is water that greets you -- water is life and water of human possibility --
316	and it sets an attitude and expectation
319	about how you feel about people before you ever give them a speech.
324	So, from that fountain I built this building.
330	As you can see, it has world class art, and it's all my taste
335	because I raised all the money.
337	(Laughter)
338	"I said to my boy, ""When you raise the money,"
341	"we'll put your taste on the wall."""
344	That we have quilts and clay and calligraphy
347	and everywhere your eye turns,
349	there's something beautiful looking back at you,
351	that's deliberate.
353	That's intentional.
355	In my view, it is this kind of world
359	that can redeem the soul of poor people.
364	We also created a boardroom,
369	and I hired a Japanese cabinetmaker from Kyoto, Japan,
373	and commissioned him to do 60 pieces of furniture for our building.
377	We have since spun him off into his own business.
380	He's making a ton of money doing custom furniture for rich people.
383	And I got 60 pieces out of it for my school
386	because I felt that welfare moms and ex-steel workers
389	and single parents deserved to come to a school
394	where there was handcrafted furniture that greeted them every day.
397	Because it sets a tone and an attitude about how you feel about people
401	long before you give them the speech.
404	We even have flowers in the hallway, and they're not plastic.
410	Those are real and they're in my building every day.
413	And now that I've given lots of speeches,
415	we had a bunch of high school principals come and see me,
418	"and they said, ""Mr. Strickland,"
420	what an extraordinary story and what a great school.
423	And we were particularly touched by the flowers
426	"and we were curious as to how the flowers got there."""
428	"I said, ""Well, I got in my car and I went out to the greenhouse"
431	"and I bought them and I brought them back and I put them there."""
434	You don't need a task force or a study group to buy flowers for your kids.
440	What you need to know is that the children
443	and the adults deserve flowers in their life.
446	The cost is incidental but the gesture is huge.
449	And so in my building, which is full of sunlight and full of flowers,
455	we believe in hope and human possibilities.
457	That happens to be at Christmas time.
459	And so the next thing you'll see is a million dollar kitchen
465	that was built by the Heinz company -- you've heard of them?
469	They did all right in the ketchup business.
472	And I happen to know that company pretty well
474	because John Heinz, who was our U.S. senator --
477	who was tragically killed in a plane accident --
480	he had heard about my desire to build a new building,
483	because I had a cardboard box and I put it in a garbage bag
486	and I walking all over Pittsburgh trying to raise money for this site.
489	And he called me into his office --
491	which is the equivalent of going to see the Wizard of Oz
494	(Laughter) --
495	and John Heinz had 600 million dollars, and at the time I had about 60 cents.
499	"And he said, ""But we've heard about you."
501	We've heard about your work with the kids and the ex-steel workers,
504	and we're inclined to want to support your desire to build a new building.
509	And you could do us a great service
511	"if you would add a culinary program to your program."""
516	Because back then, we were building a trades program.
519	"He said, ""That way we could fulfill our affirmative action goals"
521	"for the Heinz company."""
523	"I said, ""Senator, I'm reluctant to go into a field"
528	that I don't know much about, but I promise you
531	that if you'll support my school, I'll get it built
534	and in a couple of years, I'll come back
536	"and weigh out that program that you desire."""
538	And Senator Heinz sat very quietly and he said,
542	"""Well, what would your reaction be"
544	"if I said I'd give you a million dollars?"""
547	"I said, ""Senator, it appears that we're going into the food training business."""
552	(Laughter)
559	And John Heinz did give me a million bucks.
562	And most importantly,
564	he loaned me the head of research for the Heinz company.
567	And we kind of borrowed the curriculum from the Culinary Institute of America,
571	which in their mind is kind of the Harvard of cooking schools,
574	and we created a gourmet cooks program for welfare mothers
578	in this million dollar kitchen in the middle of the inner city.
582	And we've never looked back.
584	I would like to show you now some of the food
588	that these welfare mothers do in this million dollar kitchen.
592	That happens to be our cafeteria line.
595	That's puff pastry day. Why?
598	Because the students made puff pastry
600	and that's what the school ate every day.
602	But the concept was that I wanted to take the stigma out of food.
607	That good food's not for rich people --
610	good food's for everybody on the planet,
612	and there's no excuse why we all can't be eating it.
615	So at my school, we subsidize a gourmet lunch program
620	for welfare mothers in the middle of the inner city
623	because we've discovered that it's good for their stomachs,
625	but it's better for their heads.
627	Because I wanted to let them know every day of their life
632	that they have value at this place I call my center.
636	We have students who sit together, black kids and white kids,
642	and what we've discovered is you can solve the race problem
647	by creating a world class environment,
650	because people will have a tendency to show you world class behavior
654	if you treat them in that way.
657	These are examples of the food that welfare mothers are doing
662	after six months in the training program.
665	No sophistication, no class, no dignity, no history.
671	What we've discovered is the only thing wrong with poor people
675	is they don't have any money, which happens to be a curable condition.
681	It's all in the way that you think about people
684	that often determines their behavior.
686	That was done by a student after seven months in the program,
690	done by a very brilliant young woman
694	who was taught by our pastry chef.
696	I've actually eaten seven of those baskets and they're very good.
699	(Laughter)
700	They have no calories.
702	That's our dining room.
704	It looks like your average high school cafeteria
708	in your average town in America.
711	But this is my view of how students ought to be treated,
715	particularly once they have been pushed aside.
718	We train pharmaceutical technicians for the pharmacy industry,
724	we train medical technicians for the medical industry,
727	and we train chemical technicians for companies
731	like Bayer and Calgon Carbon and Fisher Scientific and Exxon.
735	And I will guarantee you that if you come to my center in Pittsburgh --
741	and you're all invited --
743	you'll see welfare mothers doing analytical chemistry
745	with logarithmic calculators
750	There is absolutely no reason why poor people
755	can't learn world class technology.
758	What we've discovered is you have to give them flowers
761	and sunlight and food and expectations and Herbie's music,
767	and you can cure a spiritual cancer every time.
772	We train corporate travel agents for the travel industry.
777	We even teach people how to read.
780	The kid with the red stripe was in the program two years ago --
784	he's now an instructor.
786	And I have children with high school diplomas that they can't read.
791	And so you must ask yourself the question:
794	how is it possible in the 21st century
799	that we graduate children from schools
802	who can't read the diplomas that they have in their hands?
805	The reason is that the system gets reimbursed
808	for the kids they spit out the other end, not the children who read.
813	I can take these children and in 20 weeks,
818	demonstrated aptitude; I can get them high school equivalent.
822	No big deal.
825	That's our library with more handcrafted furniture.
831	And this is the arts program I started in 1968.
835	Remember I'm the black kid from the '60s who got his life saved with ceramics.
839	Well, I went out and decided to reproduce my experience
842	with other kids in the neighborhood,
844	the theory being if you get kids flowers and you give them food
848	and you give them sunshine and enthusiasm,
851	you can bring them right back to life.
853	I have 400 kids from the Pittsburgh public school system
856	that come to me every day of the week for arts education.
861	And these are children who are flunking out of public school.
864	And last year I put 88 percent of those kids in college
867	and I've averaged over 80 percent for 15 years.
871	We've made a fascinating discovery:
873	there's nothing wrong with the kids
876	that affection and sunshine and food and enthusiasm
881	and Herbie's music can't cure.
884	For that I won a big old plaque -- Man of the Year in Education.
888	I beat out all the Ph.D.'s
890	because I figured that if you treat children like human beings,
893	it increases the likelihood they're going to behave that way.
896	And why we can't institute that policy
899	in every school and in every city and every town
905	remains a mystery to me.
908	Let me show you what these people do.
911	We have ceramics and photography and computer imaging.
915	And these are all kids with no artistic ability, no talent,
920	no imagination. And we bring in the world's greatest artists --
924	Gordon Parks has been there, Chester Higgins has been there --
927	and what we've learned
929	is that the children will become like the people who teach them.
933	In fact, I brought in a mosaic artist from the Vatican,
937	an African-American woman
939	who had studied the old Vatican mosaic techniques,
942	and let me show you what they did with the work.
946	These were children who the whole world had given up on,
950	who were flunking out of public school,
952	and that's what they're capable of doing
954	with affection and sunlight and food and good music and confidence.
964	We teach photography.
966	And these are examples of some of the kids' work.
970	That boy won a four-year scholarship
973	on the strength of that photograph.
976	This is our gallery.
978	We have a world class gallery
980	because we believe that poor kids need a world class gallery,
984	so I designed this thing.
986	We have smoked salmon at the art openings,
988	we have a formal printed invitation,
991	and I even have figured out a way to get their parents to come.
994	I couldn't buy a parent 15 years ago
997	so I hired a guy who got off on the Jesus big time.
1001	He was dragging guys out of bars
1003	and saving those lives for the Lord.
1005	"And I said, ""Bill, I want to hire you, man."
1009	You have to tone down the Jesus stuff a little bit,
1011	but keep the enthusiasm.
1013	(Laughter) (Applause)
1016	"I can't get these parents to come to the school."""
1020	"He said, ""I'll get them to come to the school."""
1022	So, he jumped in the van, he went to Miss Jones' house and said,
1024	"""Miss Jones, I knew you wanted to come to your kid's art opening"
1027	but you probably didn't have a ride.
1030	"So, I came to give you a ride."""
1032	And he got 10 parents and then 20 parents.
1035	At the last show that we did, 200 parents showed up
1039	and we didn't pick up one parent.
1041	Because now it's become socially not acceptable not to show up
1046	to support your children at the Manchester Craftsmen's Guild
1049	because people think you're bad parents.
1051	And there is no statistical difference
1053	between the white parents and the black parents.
1057	Mothers will go where their children are being celebrated,
1062	every time, every town, every city.
1068	I wanted you to see this gallery because it's as good as it gets.
1076	And by the time I cut these kids loose from high school,
1079	they've got four shows on their resume
1082	before they apply to college because it's all up here.
1085	You have to change the way that people see themselves
1089	before you can change their behavior.
1092	And it's worked out pretty good up to this day.
1097	I even stuck another room on the building, which I'd like to show you.
1103	This is brand new.
1105	We just got this slide done in time for the TED Conference.
1109	I gave this little slide show at a place called the Silicon Valley
1114	and I did all right.
1116	And the woman came out of the audience,
1118	"she said, ""That was a great story"
1120	and I was very impressed with your presentation.
1122	"My only criticism is your computers are getting a little bit old."""
1125	"And I said, ""Well, what do you do for a living?"""
1128	"She said, ""Well, I work for a company called Hewlett-Packard."""
1132	"And I said, ""You're in the computer business, is that right?"""
1135	"She said, ""Yes, sir."""
1137	"And I said, ""Well, there's an easy solution to that problem."""
1139	Well, I'm very pleased to announce to you that HP
1143	and a furniture company called Steelcase
1146	have adopted us as a demonstration model for all of their technology
1150	and all their furniture for the United States of America.
1153	And that's the room
1155	that's initiating the relationship.
1157	We got it just done in time to show you,
1159	so it's kind of the world debut of our digital imaging center.
1163	(Applause)
1164	(Music)
1172	I only have a couple more slides,
1174	and this is where the story gets kind of interesting.
1177	So, I just want you to listen up for a couple more minutes
1180	and you'll understand why he's there and I'm here.
1185	In 1986, I had the presence of mind to stick a music hall
1189	on the north end of the building while I was building it.
1192	And a guy named Dizzy Gillespie showed up to play there
1197	because he knew this man over here, Marty Ashby.
1201	And I stood on that stage with Dizzy Gillespie on sound check
1205	on a Wednesday afternoon, and I said,
1207	"""Dizzy, why would you come to a black-run center"
1210	in the middle of an industrial park with a high crime rate
1214	"that doesn't even have a reputation in music?"""
1216	"He said, ""Because I heard you built the center"
1218	and I didn't believe that you did it, and I wanted to see for myself.
1221	"And now that I have, I want to give you a gift."""
1226	"I said, ""You're the gift."""
1228	"He said, ""No, sir. You're the gift."
1230	And I'm going to allow you to record the concert
1232	and I'm going to give you the music,
1234	and if you ever choose to sell it, you must sign an agreement
1237	"that says the money will come back and support the school."""
1239	And I recorded Dizzy. And he died a year later,
1244	but not before telling a fellow named McCoy Tyner what we were doing.
1248	And he showed up and said,
1250	"""Dizzy talking about you all over the country, man,"
1252	"and I want to help you."""
1254	And then a guy named Wynton Marsalis showed up.
1257	Then a bass player named Ray Brown,
1260	and a fellow named Stanley Turrentine,
1263	and a piano player named Herbie Hancock,
1266	and a band called the Count Basie Orchestra,
1272	and a fellow named Tito Puente,
1275	and a guy named Gary Burton, and Shirley Horn, and Betty Carter,
1280	and Dakota Staton and Nancy Wilson
1283	all have come to this center in the middle of an industrial park
1288	to sold out audiences in the middle of the inner city.
1291	And I'm very pleased to tell you that, with their permission,
1295	I have now accumulated 600 recordings
1298	of the greatest artists in the world,
1300	including Joe Williams, who died,
1304	but not before his last recording was done at my school.
1309	And Joe Williams came up to me and he put his hand on my shoulder
1319	"and he said, ""God's picked you, man, to do this work."
1327	"And I want my music to be with you."""
1330	And that worked out all right.
1334	When the Basie band came, the band got so excited about the school
1339	they voted to give me the rights to the music.
1342	And I recorded it and we won something called a Grammy.
1347	And like a fool, I didn't go to the ceremony
1350	because I didn't think we were going to win.
1352	Well, we did win,
1354	and our name was literally in lights over Madison Square Garden.
1356	Then the U.N. Jazz Orchestra dropped by and we recorded them
1365	and got nominated for a second Grammy back to back.
1370	So, we've become one of the hot, young jazz recording studios
1373	in the United States of America
1375	(Laughter)
1376	in the middle of the inner city with a high crime rate.
1382	That's the place all filled up with Republicans.
1388	(Laughter)
1392	(Applause)
1393	If you'd have dropped a bomb on that room,
1395	you'd have wiped out all the money in Pennsylvania
1397	because it was all sitting there.
1399	Including my mother and father, who lived long enough
1402	to see their kid build that building.
1405	And there's Dizzy, just like I told you. He was there.
1409	And he was there, Tito Puente.
1412	And Pat Metheny and Jim Hall were there
1415	and they recorded with us.
1417	And that was our first recording studio, which was the broom closet.
1422	We put the mops in the hallway and re-engineered the thing
1425	and that's where we recorded the first Grammy.
1428	And this is our new facility, which is all video technology.
1432	And that is a room that was built for a woman named Nancy Wilson,
1436	who recorded that album at our school last Christmas.
1444	And any of you who happened to have been watching Oprah Winfrey
1446	on Christmas Day, he was there and Nancy was there
1450	singing excerpts from this album,
1452	the rights to which she donated to our school.
1456	And I can now tell you with absolute certainty
1458	that an appearance on Oprah Winfrey will sell 10,000 CDs.
1463	(Laughter)
1465	We are currently number four on the Billboard Charts,
1468	right behind Tony Bennett.
1470	And I think we're going to be fine.
1472	This was burned out during the riots -- this is next to my building --
1476	and so I had another cardboard box built
1479	and I walked back out in the streets again.
1481	And that's the building, and that's the model,
1484	and on the right's a high-tech greenhouse
1487	and in the middle's the medical technology building.
1489	And I'm very pleased to tell you that the building's done.
1492	It's also full of anchor tenants at 20 dollars a foot --
1497	triple that in the middle of the inner city.
1499	And there's the fountain.
1501	(Laughter)
1503	Every building has a fountain.
1505	And the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center are anchor tenants
1508	and they took half the building,
1510	and we now train medical technicians through all their system.
1513	And Mellon Bank's a tenant.
1515	And I love them because they pay the rent on time.
1518	(Laughter)
1519	And as a result of the association,
1521	I'm now a director of the Mellon Financial Corporation
1524	that bought Dreyfus.
1529	And this is in the process of being built as we speak.
1533	Multiply that picture times four and you will see the greenhouse
1538	that's going to open in October this year
1540	because we're going to grow those flowers
1544	in the middle of the inner city.
1546	And we're going to have high school kids
1548	growing Phalaenopsis orchids in the middle of the inner city.
1553	And we have a handshake with one of the large retail grocers
1557	to sell our orchids in all 240 stores in six states.
1562	And our partners are Zuma Canyon Orchids of Malibu, California,
1566	who are Hispanic.
1568	So, the Hispanics and the black folks have formed a partnership
1571	to grow high technology orchids in the middle of the inner city.
1575	And I told my United States senator
1578	that there was a very high probability
1580	that if he could find some funding for this,
1582	we would become a left-hand column in the Wall Street Journal,
1586	to which he readily agreed.
1588	And we got the funding and we open in the fall.
1590	And you ought to come and see it -- it's going to be a hell of a story.
1593	And this is what I want to do when I grow up.
1598	(Laughter)
1600	The brown building is the one you guys have been looking at
1603	and I'll tell you where I made my big mistake.
1606	I had a chance to buy this whole industrial park --
1610	which is less than 1,000 feet from the riverfront --
1612	for four million dollars and I didn't do it.
1616	And I built the first building, and guess what happened?
1620	I appreciated the real estate values beyond everybody's expectations
1624	and the owners of the park turned me down for eight million dollars last year,
1630	"and said, ""Mr. Strickland,"
1632	you ought to get the Civic Leader of the Year Award
1634	because you've appreciated our property values
1636	beyond our wildest expectations.
1638	"Thank you very much for that."""
1641	The moral of the story is you must be prepared to act on your dreams,
1646	just in case they do come true.
1649	And finally, there's this picture.
1655	This is in a place called San Francisco.
1658	And the reason this picture's in here is
1661	I did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economics summit,
1665	and there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me.
1667	"He said, ""Man, that's a great story."
1669	"I want one of those."""
1671	"I said, ""Well, I'm very flattered. What do you do for a living?"""
1674	"He says, ""I run the city of San Francisco."
1676	"My name's Willie Brown."""
1679	And so I kind of accepted the flattery and the praise
1684	and put it out of my mind.
1686	And that weekend, I was going back home
1688	and Herbie Hancock was playing our center that night --
1693	first time I'd met him.
1695	"And he walked in and he says, ""What is this?"""
1698	"And I said, ""Herbie, this is my concept of a training center"
1702	"for poor people."""
1704	"And he said, ""As God as my witness,"
1707	I've had a center like this in my mind for 25 years and you've built it.
1711	"And now I really want to build one."""
1713	"I said, ""Well, where would you build this thing?"""
1715	"He said, ""San Francisco."""
1717	"I said, ""Any chance you know Willie Brown?"""
1720	(Laughter)
1722	As a matter of fact he did know Willie Brown,
1725	and Willie Brown and Herbie and I had dinner four years ago,
1728	and we started drawing out that center on the tablecloth.
1731	"And Willie Brown said, ""As sure as I'm the mayor of San Francisco,"
1735	I'm going to build this thing
1737	"as a legacy to the poor people of this city."""
1741	And he got me five acres of land on San Francisco Bay
1745	and we got an architect and we got a general contractor
1749	and we got Herbie on the board,
1752	and our friends from HP, and our friends from Steelcase,
1755	and our friends from Cisco, and our friends from Wells Fargo
1758	and Genentech.
1760	And along the way, I met this real short guy
1764	at my slide show in the Silicon Valley.
1768	He came up to me afterwards,
1770	"he said, ""Man, that's a fabulous story."
1773	"I want to help you."""
1775	"And I said, ""Well, thank you very much for that."
1777	"What do you do for a living?"""
1779	"He said, ""Well, I built a company called eBay."""
1783	"I said, ""Well, that's very nice."
1785	"Thanks very much, and give me your card and sometime we'll talk."""
1788	I didn't know eBay from that jar of water sitting on that piano,
1793	but I had the presence of mind to go back
1795	and talk to one of the techie kids at my center.
1798	"I said, ""Hey man, what is eBay?"""
1800	"He said, ""Well, that's the electronic commerce network."""
1803	"I said, ""Well, I met the guy who built the thing"
1805	"and he left me his card."""
1808	"So, I called him up on the phone and I said, ""Mr. Skoll,"
1811	I've come to have a much deeper appreciation of who you are
1815	(Laughter)
1820	"and I'd like to become your friend."""
1823	(Laughter)
1826	And Jeff and I did become friends,
1829	and he's organized a team of people
1832	and we're going to build this center.
1837	And I went down into the neighborhood called Bayview-Hunters Point,
1843	"and I said, ""The mayor sent me down here to work with you"
1847	and I want to build a center with you,
1850	but I'm not going to build you anything if you don't want it.
1853	"And all I've got is a box of slides."""
1856	And so I stood up in front of 200 very angry, very disappointed people
1862	on a summer night, and the air conditioner had broken
1865	and it was 100 degrees outside,
1869	and I started showing these pictures.
1871	And after about 10 pictures they all settled down.
1875	"And I ran the story and I said, ""What do you think?"""
1880	And in the back of the room, a woman stood up and she said,
1883	"""In 35 years of living in this God forsaken place,"
1886	you're the only person that's come down here and treated us with dignity.
1890	"I'm going with you, man."""
1893	And she turned that audience around on a pin.
1896	And I promised these people that I was going to build this thing,
1900	and we're going to build it all right.
1902	And I think we can get in the ground this year
1905	as the first replication of the center in Pittsburgh.
1909	But I met a guy named Quincy Jones along the way
1915	and I showed him the box of slides.
1919	"And Quincy said, ""I want to help you, man."
1922	"Let's do one in L.A."""
1926	And so he's assembled a group of people.
1929	And I've fallen in love with him,
1931	as I have with Herbie and with his music.
1935	"And Quincy said, ""Where did the idea for centers like this come from?"""
1941	"And I said, ""It came from your music, man."
1944	Because Mr. Ross used to bring in your albums
1947	when I was 16 years old in the pottery class,
1950	when the world was all dark,
1953	"and your music got me to the sunlight."""
1957	"And I said, ""If I can follow that music,"
1959	I'll get out into the sunlight and I'll be OK.
1963	"And if that's not true, how did I get here?"""
1968	I want you all to know
1972	that I think the world is a place that's worth living.
1976	I believe in you.
1980	I believe in your hopes and your dreams,
1984	I believe in your intelligence
1987	and I believe in your enthusiasm.
1989	And I'm tired of living like this,
1992	going into town after town with people standing around on corners
1997	with holes where eyes used to be, their spirits damaged.
2004	We won't make it as a country unless we can turn this thing around.
2008	In Pennsylvania it costs 60,000 dollars to keep people in jail,
2014	most of whom look like me.
2016	It's 40,000 dollars to build the University of Pittsburgh Medical School.
2020	It's 20,000 dollars cheaper to build a medical school than to keep people in jail.
2024	Do the math -- it will never work.
2029	I am banking on you
2031	and I'm banking on guys like Herbie and Quincy and Hackett and Richard
2040	and very decent people who still believe in something.
2046	And I want to do this in my lifetime, in every city and in every town.
2055	And I don't think I'm crazy.
2057	I think we can get home on this thing
2059	and I think we can build these all over the country
2062	for less money than we're spending on prisons.
2066	And I believe we can turn this whole story around
2069	to one of celebration and one of hope.
2073	In my business it's very difficult work.
2076	You're always fighting upstream like a salmon --
2079	never enough money, too much need --
2082	and so there is a tendency
2084	to have an occupational depression that accompanies my work.
2088	And so I've figured out, over time, the solution to the depression:
2094	you make a friend in every town and you'll never be lonely.
2100	And my hope is that I've made a few here tonight.
2105	And thanks for listening to what I had to say.
2108	(Applause)
