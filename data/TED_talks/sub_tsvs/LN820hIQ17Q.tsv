12.682	I was raised by lesbians in the mountains,
14.794	and I sort of came like a forest gnome
14.794	to New York City a while back.
18.392	(Laughter)
19.55	Really messed with my head,
19.55	but I'll get into that later.
24.969	I'll start with when
24.969	I was eight years old.
27.739	I took a wood box,
29.679	and I buried a dollar bill, a pen
29.679	and a fork inside this box in Colorado.
35.131	And I thought some strange humanoids
35.131	or aliens in 500 years would find this box
40.739	and learn about the way
40.739	our species exchanged ideas,
45.289	maybe how we ate our spaghetti.
47.347	I really didn't know.
49.401	Anyway, this is kind of funny,
50.862	because here I am, 30 years later,
50.862	and I'm still making boxes.
56.289	Now, at some point I was in Hawaii --
59.296	I like to hike and surf
59.296	and do all that weird stuff,
61.822	and I was making a collage for my ma.
64.35	And I took a dictionary
64.35	and I ripped it up,
66.462	and I made it into a sort
66.462	of Agnes Martin grid,
69.221	and I poured resin all over it
69.221	and a bee got stuck.
71.816	Now, she's afraid of bees
71.816	and she's allergic to them,
74.558	so I poured more resin on the canvas,
74.558	thinking I could hide it or something.
78.817	Instead, the opposite happened:
80.381	It sort of created a magnification,
82.087	like a magnifying glass,
82.087	on the dictionary text.
85.278	So what did I do? I built more boxes.
87.958	This time, I started putting
87.958	electronics, frogs,
91.886	strange bottles I'd find in the street --
91.886	anything I could find --
95.457	because I was always
95.457	finding things my whole life,
97.83	and trying to make relationships
97.83	and tell stories between these objects.
101.896	So I started drawing around the objects,
104.301	and I realized: Holy moly,
104.301	I can draw in space!
107.637	I can make free-floating lines,
109.66	like the way you would draw
109.66	around a dead body at a crime scene.
112.707	So I took the objects out,
114.007	and I created my own taxonomy
114.007	of invented specimens.
117.46	First, botanical --
117.46	which you can kind of get a sense of.
121.52	Then I made some
121.52	weird insects and creatures.
125.992	It was really fun; I was just
125.992	drawing on the layers of resin.
128.89	And it was cool, because I was actually
128.89	starting to have shows and stuff,
132.372	I was making some money,
132.372	I could take my girlfriend for dinner,
135.368	and like, go to Sizzler.
136.647	It was some good shit, man.
138.076	(Laughter)
139.728	At some point, I got up to the human form,
143.658	life-size resin sculptures
143.658	with drawings of humans inside the layers.
148.309	This was great, except for one thing:
150.792	I was going to die.
152.536	I didn't know what to do,
152.536	because the resin was going to kill me.
155.623	And I went to bed every night
155.623	thinking about it.
157.96	So I tried using glass.
160.476	I started drawing on the layers of glass,
162.489	almost like if you drew on a window,
162.489	then you put another window,
165.585	and another window, and you had
165.585	all these windows together
168.352	that made a three-dimensional composition.
170.511	And this really worked,
170.511	because I could stop using the resin.
173.937	So I did this for years,
175.342	which culminated in a very large work,
175.342	"which I call ""The Triptych."""
180.127	"""The Triptych"" was largely inspired"
182.072	by Hieronymus Bosch's
182.072	"""[The] Garden of Earthly Delights,"""
185.033	which is a painting
185.033	in the [Museo del] Prado in Spain.
187.681	Do you guys know this painting?
189.404	Good, it's a cool painting.
190.721	It's kind of ahead of its time, they say.
192.719	"So, ""The Triptych."""
192.719	I'll walk you through this piece.
195.234	It weighs 24,000 pounds.
198.905	It's 18 feet long.
200.906	It's double-sided,
200.906	so it's 36 feet of composition.
203.681	It's kind of weird.
206.648	Well, that's the blood fountain.
209.084	(Laughter)
211.321	To the left, you have
211.321	Jesus and the locusts.
214.472	There's a cave
215.703	where all these animal-headed creatures
215.703	travel between two worlds.
218.974	They go from the representational world,
220.92	to this analog-mesh underworld,
220.92	where they're hiding.
223.828	This is where the animal-headed creatures
223.828	are by the lighthouse,
226.915	and they're all about to commit
226.915	mass suicide into the ocean.
229.778	The ocean is made up
229.778	of thousands of elements.
232.77	This is a bird god
232.77	tied up to a battleship.
235.093	(Laughter)
236.155	Billy Graham is in the ocean;
237.783	the Horizon from the oil spill;
237.783	Waldo; Osama Bin Laden's shelter --
242.034	there's all kinds of weird stuff
242.034	that you can find
244.401	if you look really hard, in the ocean.
246.741	Anyway, this is a lady creature.
249.184	She's coming out of the ocean,
249.184	and she's spitting oil into one hand
252.658	and she has clouds
252.658	coming out of her other hand.
255.199	Her hands are like scales,
256.83	and she has the mythological reference
256.83	of the Earth and cosmos in balance.
262.07	"So that's one side of ""The Triptych."""
263.905	It's a little narrative thing.
265.389	That's her hand that she's spitting into.
268.19	And then, when you go to the other side,
270.13	she has like a trunk, like a bird's beak,
272.263	and she's spitting clouds
272.263	out of her trunk.
274.662	Then she has an 18-foot-long serpent's
274.662	"tail that connects ""The Triptych."""
278.746	Anyway, her tail catches on fire
278.746	from the back of the volcano.
281.759	(Laughter)
282.86	I don't know why that happened.
284.572	(Laughter)
286.154	That happens, you know.
288.473	Her tail terminates
288.473	in a cycloptic eyeball,
291.969	made out of 1986 terrorist cards.
294.524	Have you guys seen those?
295.753	They were made in the 1980's,
295.753	they're like baseball cards of terrorists.
299.175	Way ahead of their time.
300.358	(Laughter)
302.715	That will bring you to my latest project.
304.736	I'm in the middle of two projects:
306.413	"One's called ""Psychogeographies."""
308.057	It's about a six-year project
308.057	to make 100 of these humans.
311.161	Each one is an archive of our culture,
313.555	through our ripped-up media and matter,
315.578	whether it's encyclopedias
315.578	or dictionaries or magazines.
318.886	But each one acts as a sort of an archive
318.886	in the shape of a human,
322.083	and they travel in groups
322.083	of 20, 4, or 12 at a time.
325.516	They're like cells --
325.516	they come together, they divide.
328.826	And you kind of walk through them.
328.826	It's taking me years.
331.486	Each one is basically
331.486	a 3,000-pound microscope slide
335.495	with a human stuck inside.
338.208	This one has a little cave in his chest.
340.679	That's his head; there's the chest,
340.679	you can kind of see the beginning.
343.998	I'm going to go down the body for you:
346.053	There's a waterfall
346.053	coming out of his chest,
350.115	covering his penis -- or not-penis,
350.115	or whatever it is,
352.743	a kind of androgynous thing.
354.655	I'll take you quickly through these works,
357.568	because I can't explain them for too long.
360.449	There are the layers,
360.449	you can kind of see it.
363.812	That's a body getting split in half.
366.351	This one has two heads,
367.622	and it's communicating
367.622	between the two heads.
370.319	You can see the pills coming out,
372.119	going into one head
372.119	from this weird statue.
374.484	There's a little forest scene
374.484	inside the chest cavity.
377.339	Can you see that?
378.521	Anyway, this talk's all about these boxes,
380.632	like the boxes we're in.
382.904	This box we're in,
382.904	the solar system is a box.
385.815	This brings you to my latest box.
388.382	It's a brick box.
388.382	It's called Pioneer Works.
390.857	(Cheers)
392.194	Inside of this box is a physicist,
396.73	a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician,
399.88	a writer, a radio station,
399.88	a museum, a school,
405.231	a publishing arm to disseminate all
405.231	the content we make there into the world;
410.412	a garden.
412.132	We shake this box up,
413.553	and all these people kind of start
413.553	hitting each other like particles.
416.828	And I think that's the way
416.828	you change the world.
419.151	You redefine your insides
419.151	and the box that you're living in.
423.057	And you come together to realize
423.057	that we're all in this together,
426.645	that this delusion of difference --
428.415	this idea of countries, of borders,
428.415	of religion -- doesn't work.
433.931	We're all really made up
433.931	of the same stuff, in the same box.
438.584	And if we don't start
438.584	exchanging that stuff sweetly and nicely,
442.632	we're all going to die real soon.
445.299	Thank you very much.
447.012	(Applause)
