12.462	As humans, it's in our nature
14.161	to want to improve our health 
14.161	and minimize our suffering.
17.455	Whatever life throws at us,
19.122	whether it's cancer, diabetes, heart disease,
21.587	or even broken bones, we want to try and get better.
24.779	Now I'm head of a biomaterials lab,
27.262	and I'm really fascinated by the way that humans
30.002	have used materials in really creative ways
32.47	in the body over time.
35.214	Take, for example, this beautiful blue nacre shell.
38.86	This was actually used by the Mayans
40.742	as an artificial tooth replacement.
44.281	We're not quite sure why they did it.
45.914	It's hard. It's durable.
48.49	But it also had other very nice properties.
52.608	In fact, when they put it into the jawbone,
54.888	it could integrate into the jaw,
57.795	and we know now with very sophisticated
59.893	imaging technologies
61.566	that part of that integration comes from the fact
63.915	that this material is designed
65.602	in a very specific way, has a beautiful chemistry,
68.421	has a beautiful architecture.
70.649	And I think in many ways we can sort of think
72.401	of the use of the blue nacre shell and the Mayans
75.408	as the first real application
76.928	of the bluetooth technology.
79.223	(Laughter)
80.685	But if we move on and think throughout history
85.078	how people have used different 
85.078	materials in the body,
88.062	very often it's been physicians
89.776	that have been quite creative.
91.168	They've taken things off the shelf.
93.136	One of my favorite examples
95.036	is that of Sir Harold Ridley,
98.278	who was a famous ophthalmologist,
100.416	or at least became a famous ophthalmologist.
102.984	And during World War II, what he would see
104.911	would be pilots coming back from their missions,
107.763	and he noticed that within their eyes
109.515	they had shards of small bits of material
112.455	lodged within the eye,
113.975	but the very interesting thing about it
115.674	was that material, actually, wasn't causing
117.967	any inflammatory response.
119.98	So he looked into this, and he figured out
122.319	that actually that material was little shards of plastic
124.923	that were coming from the canopy of the Spitfires.
127.662	And this led him to propose that material
130.063	as a new material for intraocular lenses.
132.825	It's called PMMA, and it's now used
134.93	in millions of people every year
136.732	and helps in preventing cataracts.
139.501	And that example, I think, is a really nice one,
141.81	because it helps remind us that in the early days,
144.245	people often chose materials
146.198	because they were bioinert.
148.083	Their very purpose was to 
148.083	perform a mechanical function.
151.595	You'd put them in the body
153.045	and you wouldn't get an adverse response.
155.209	And what I want to show you is that
156.877	in regenerative medicine,
158.258	we've really shifted away from that idea
160.082	of taking a bioinert material.
161.995	We're actually actively looking for materials
164.284	that will be bioactive, that will interact with the body,
167.252	and that furthermore we can put in the body,
169.579	they'll have their function,
171.028	and then they'll dissolve away over time.
175.578	If we look at this schematic,
177.511	this is showing you what we think of
179.112	as the typical tissue-engineering approach.
181.249	We have cells there, typically from the patient.
184.093	We can put those onto a material,
185.975	and we can make that material 
185.975	very complex if we want to,
188.708	and we can then grow that up in the lab
190.878	or we can put it straight back into the patient.
193.393	And this is an approach that's 
193.393	used all over the world,
195.844	including in our lab.
199.367	But one of the things that's really important
201.824	when we're thinking about stem cells
203.702	is that obviously stem cells 
203.702	can be many different things,
206.281	and they want to be many different things,
208.045	and so we want to make sure that the environment
209.921	we put them into has enough information
212.271	so that they can become the right sort
214.267	of specialist tissue.
216.953	And if we think about the different types of tissues
220.016	that people are looking at regenerating
222.035	all over the world, in all the 
222.035	different labs in the world,
224.346	there's pretty much every tissue you can think of.
227.282	And actually, the structure of those tissues
228.904	is quite different, and it's going to really depend
231.518	on whether your patient has any underlying disease,
233.936	other conditions, in terms of how
236.986	you're going to regenerate your tissue,
238.547	and you're going to need to think about the materials
240.532	you're going to use really carefully,
242.586	their biochemistry, their mechanics,
244.311	and many other properties as well.
248.049	Our tissues all have very 
248.049	different abilities to regenerate,
251.349	and here we see poor Prometheus,
253.091	who made a rather tricky career choice
256.184	and was punished by the Greek gods.
259.118	He was tied to a rock, and an eagle would come
261.439	every day to eat his liver.
263.042	But of course his liver would regenerate every day,
265.309	and so day after day he was punished
267.581	for eternity by the gods.
273.378	And liver will regenerate in this very nice way,
277.258	but actually if we think of other tissues,
279.034	like cartilage, for example,
280.803	even the simplest nick and you're going to find it
282.859	really difficult to regenerate your cartilage.
285.302	So it's going to be very different from tissue to tissue.
288.416	Now, bone is somewhere in between,
291.216	and this is one of the tissues 
291.216	that we work on a lot in our lab.
294.116	And bone is actually quite good at repairing.
296.1	It has to be. We've probably all had fractures
298.113	at some point or other.
299.925	And one of the ways that you can think
302.082	about repairing your fracture
303.771	is this procedure here, called 
303.771	an iliac crest harvest.
306.598	And what the surgeon might do
308.264	is take some bone from your iliac crest,
311.459	which is just here,
312.837	and then transplant that 
312.837	somewhere else in the body.
315.361	And it actually works really well,
316.961	because it's your own bone,
318.46	and it's well vascularized,
319.694	which means it's got a really good blood supply.
322.063	But the problem is, there's
322.063	only so much you can take,
324.846	and also when you do that operation,
327.769	your patients might actually have significant pain
330.308	in that defect site even two 
330.308	years after the operation.
333.549	So what we were thinking is,
335.435	there's a tremendous need 
335.435	for bone repair, of course,
338.584	but this iliac crest-type approach
341.071	really has a lot of limitations to it,
343.503	and could we perhaps recreate
345.737	the generation of bone within the body
347.906	on demand and then be able to transplant it
351.221	without these very, very painful aftereffects
356.126	that you would have with the iliac crest harvest?
359.809	And so this is what we did, and the way we did it
362.471	was by coming back to this typical tissue-engineering approach
365.809	but actually thinking about it rather differently.
368.196	And we simplified it a lot,
370.115	so we got rid of a lot of these steps.
372.166	We got rid of the need to 
372.166	harvest cells from the patient,
374.54	we got rid of the need to put 
374.54	in really fancy chemistries,
377.457	and we got rid of the need
379.149	to culture these scaffolds in the lab.
381.977	And what we really focused on
384.156	was our material system and making it quite simple,
387.905	but because we used it in a really clever way,
390.23	we were able to generate enormous amounts of bone
392.877	using this approach.
394.523	So we were using the body
396.276	as really the catalyst to help us
398.396	to make lots of new bone.
400.939	And it's an approach that we call
402.522	the in vivo bioreactor, and we were able to make
405.333	enormous amounts of bone using this approach.
407.819	And I'll talk you through this.
409.058	So what we do is,
411.538	in humans, we all have a layer of stem cells
413.881	on the outside of our long bones.
415.769	That layer is called the periosteum.
417.472	And that layer is actually normally
419.76	very, very tightly bound to the underlying bone,
422.409	and it's got stem cells in it.
423.841	Those stem cells are really important
425.26	in the embryo when it develops,
427.069	and they also sort of wake up if you have a fracture
429.311	to help you with repairing the bone.
432.172	So we take that periosteum layer
434.265	and we developed a way to inject underneath it
437.255	a liquid that then, within 30 seconds,
440.071	would turn into quite a rigid gel
441.816	and can actually lift the
441.816	periosteum away from the bone.
445.069	So it creates, in essence, an artificial cavity
448.757	that is right next to both the bone
452.304	but also this really rich layer of stem cells.
456.005	And we go in through a pinhole incision
457.617	so that no other cells from the body can get in,
460.57	and what happens is that that
460.57	artificial in vivo bioreactor cavity
465.362	can then lead to the proliferation of these stem cells,
468.038	and they can form lots of new tissue,
470.124	and then over time, you can harvest that tissue
472.442	and use it elsewhere in the body.
475.39	This is a histology slide
477.534	of what we see when we do that,
479.704	and essentially what we see
482.221	is very large amounts of bone.
483.855	So in this picture, you can see the middle of the leg,
486.335	so the bone marrow,
487.836	then you can see the original bone,
489.64	and you can see where that original bone finishes,
492.496	and just to the left of that is the new bone
495.007	that's grown within that bioreactor cavity,
497.044	and you can actually make it even larger.
499.475	And that demarcation that you can see
502.102	between the original bone and the new bone
504.453	acts as a very slight point of weakness,
506.466	so actually now the surgeon can come along,
508.6	can harvest away that new bone,
510.624	and the periosteum can grow back,
512.827	so you're left with the leg
514.696	in the same sort of state
516.246	as if you hadn't operated on it in the first place.
518.248	So it's very, very low in terms of after-pain
522.097	compared to an iliac crest harvest.
525.952	And you can grow different amounts of bone
528.056	depending on how much gel you put in there,
530.075	so it really is an on demand sort of procedure.
533.277	Now, at the time that we did this,
535.479	this received a lot of attention in the press,
538.816	because it was a really nice way
541.247	of generating new bone,
542.713	and we got many, many contacts
544.708	from different people that 
544.708	were interested in using this.
547.326	And I'm just going to tell you,
549.115	sometimes those contacts are very strange,
552.068	slightly unexpected,
553.928	and the very most interesting,
556.99	let me put it that way, contact that I had,
559.275	was actually from a team of American footballers
562.486	that all wanted to have double-thickness skulls
565.866	made on their head.
570.156	And so you do get these kinds of contacts,
572.88	and of course, being British
575.497	and also growing up in France,
577.251	I tend to be very blunt,
579.393	and so I had to explain to them very nicely
581.434	that in their particular case,
582.909	there probably wasn't that much in there
584.923	to protect in the first place.
587.911	(Laughter)
589.481	(Applause)
590.734	So this was our approach,
592.589	and it was simple materials,
594.233	but we thought about it carefully.
596.22	And actually we know that those cells
597.84	in the body, in the embryo, as they develop
599.978	can form a different kind of tissue, cartilage,
603.207	and so we developed a gel that was slightly different
605.762	in nature and slightly different chemistry,
608.181	put it in there, and we were able to get
612.506	And this approach works really well, I think,
614.514	for pre-planned procedures,
616.996	but it's something you do have to pre-plan.
619.868	So for other kinds of operations,
622.136	there's definitely a need for other
623.833	scaffold-based approaches.
626.336	And when you think about designing
628.705	those other scaffolds, actually,
630.343	you need a really multi-disciplinary team.
632.314	And so our team has chemists,
634.379	it has cell biologists, surgeons, physicists even,
637.756	and those people all come together
639.786	and we think really hard about 
639.786	designing the materials.
642.197	But we want to make them have enough information
645.163	that we can get the cells to do what we want,
647.317	but not be so complex as to make it difficult
649.694	to get to clinic.
651.437	And so one of the things we think about a lot
654.188	is really trying to understand
655.983	the structure of the tissues in the body.
658.36	And so if we think of bone,
660.02	obviously my own favorite tissue,
662.644	we zoom in, we can see,
664.201	even if you don't know anything 
664.201	about bone structure,
666.083	it's beautifully organized, 
666.083	really beautifully organized.
668.628	We've lots of blood vessels in there.
670.515	And if we zoom in again, we see that the cells
672.854	are actually surrounded by a 3D matrix
675.826	of nano-scale fibers, and they give a lot
677.997	of information to the cells.
680.179	And if we zoom in again,
681.793	actually in the case of bone, the matrix
683.994	around the cells is beautifully organized
686.145	at the nano scale, and it's a hybrid material
688.612	that's part organic, part inorganic.
691.196	And that's led to a whole field, really,
693.268	that has looked at developing materials
695.659	that have this hybrid kind of structure.
698.407	And so I'm showing here just two examples
701.685	where we've made some materials
701.685	that have that sort of structure,
704.805	and you can really tailor it.
706.243	You can see here a very squishy one
708.307	and now a material that's also 
708.307	this hybrid sort of material
712.406	but actually has remarkable toughness,
714.369	and it's no longer brittle.
715.829	And an inorganic material 
715.829	would normally be really brittle,
718.285	and you wouldn't be able to have
719.725	that sort of strength and toughness in it.
721.913	One other thing I want to quickly mention is that
724.402	many of the scaffolds we make 
724.402	are porous, and they have to be,
727.117	because you want blood vessels to grow in there.
729.22	But the pores are actually oftentimes
731.097	much bigger than the cells,
732.39	and so even though it's 3D,
734.101	the cell might see it more 
734.101	as a slightly curved surface,
737.456	and that's a little bit unnatural.
739.132	And so one of the things you can think about doing
741.38	is actually making scaffolds 
741.38	with slightly different dimensions
744.528	that might be able to surround your cells in 3D
747.321	and give them a little bit more information.
749.89	And there's a lot of work going 
749.89	on in both of these areas.
753.471	Now finally, I just want to talk a little bit about
757.44	applying this sort of thing to cardiovascular disease,
760.148	because this is a really big clinical problem.
763.411	And one of the things that we know is that,
766.996	unfortunately, if you have a heart attack,
769.235	then that tissue can start to die,
772.137	and your outcome may not be very good over time.
775.888	And it would be really great, actually,
777.598	if we could stop that dead tissue
779.517	either from dying or help it to regenerate.
783.502	And there's lots and lots of stem 
783.502	cell trials going on worldwide,
786.75	and they use many different types of cells,
788.822	but one common theme that seems to be coming out
791.174	is that actually, very often, those cells will die
794.173	once you've implanted them.
795.968	And you can either put them into the heart
797.843	or into the blood system,
799.863	but either way, we don't seem to be able
802.225	to get quite the right number of cells
804.092	getting to the location we want them to
806.334	and being able to deliver the sort of beautiful
810.828	cell regeneration that we would like to have
813.568	to get good clinical outcomes.
816.985	And so some of the things that we're thinking of,
818.968	and many other people in the field are thinking of,
822.089	are actually developing materials for that.
825.095	But there's a difference here.
826.714	We still need chemistry, we still need mechanics,
828.924	we still need really interesting topography,
831.595	and we still need really interesting 
831.595	ways to surround the cells.
834.243	But now, the cells also
836.754	would probably quite like a material
838.779	that's going to be able to be conductive,
840.797	because the cells themselves will respond very well
845.006	and will actually conduct signals 
845.006	between themselves.
848.485	You can see them now
850.001	beating synchronously on these materials,
852.476	and that's a very, very exciting development
855.255	that's going on.
857.369	So just to wrap up, I'd like to actually say that
862.193	being able to work in this sort of field,
864.549	all of us that work in this field
866.203	that's not only super-exciting science,
868.712	but also has the potential
870.758	to impact on patients,
872.726	however big or small they are,
875.156	is really a great privilege.
876.709	And so for that, I'd like to thank all of you as well.
879.853	Thank you.
881.17	(Applause)
