12.863	I am so excited to be here.
15.876	Everything in America
15.876	is so much bigger than in Europe.
18.704	Look at me -- I am huge!
20.7	(Laughter)
22.385	It's fantastic!
23.559	And TED Talks -- TED Talks
23.559	are where everybody has great ideas.
26.863	So the question is: Where do
26.863	those great ideas come from?
30.284	Well, it's a little bit of debate,
32.654	but it's generally reckoned
32.654	that the average person --
35.216	that's me --
36.398	has about 50,000 thoughts a day.
38.956	Which is a lot,
40.138	until you realize that 95 percent of them
42.988	are the same ones you had the day before.
45.639	(Laughter)
48.647	And a lot of mine are really boring, OK?
51.279	I think things like,
52.508	"""Oh! I know -- I must clean the floor."
55.617	"Oh! I forgot to walk the dog."""
57.373	My most popular:
58.679	"""Don't eat that cookie."""
60.609	(Laughter)
62.792	So, 95 percent repetition.
66.567	That leaves us with just a five percent
66.567	window of opportunity each day
70.908	to actually think something new.
74.731	And some of my new thoughts are useless.
76.697	The other day I was watching
76.697	some sports on television,
79.35	and I was trying to decide
79.35	why I just don't engage with it.
83.1	Some of it I find curious.
84.387	This is odd.
85.983	(Laughter)
88.362	Do you think it would be
88.362	worth being that flexible
90.789	just to be able to see
90.789	your heel at that angle?
93.065	(Laughter)
97.511	And here's the thing:
98.993	I'm never going to be able
98.993	to relate to that,
101.163	because I'm never going
101.163	to be able to do it, OK?
103.467	Well, not twice, anyway.
105.309	(Laughter)
109.133	But I'll tell you the truth.
110.491	The truth is I have never been
110.491	any good at sport, OK?
113.318	I've reached that wonderful age
113.318	when all my friends say,
116.019	"""Oh, I wish I was as fit"
116.019	"as I was when I was 18."""
119.245	And I always feel rather smug then.
121.41	(Laughter)
125.051	I'm exactly as fit as I was when I --
127.294	(Laughter)
129.643	(Applause)
132.215	I couldn't run then. I'm certainly
132.215	not going to do it now.
135.053	(Laughter)
136.1	So then I had my new idea:
137.681	Why not engage people like me in sport?
140.783	I think what the world needs now
142.575	is the Olympics for people
142.575	with zero athletic ability.
146.521	(Laughter)
148.761	Oh, it would be so much more fun.
150.428	We'd have three basic rules, OK?
152.062	Obviously no drugs;
152.062	no corruption, no skills.
155.163	(Laughter)
156.227	It would be --
157.404	No, it's a terrible idea.
159.886	And I also know why I don't engage
159.886	with sport when I watch it on television.
164.062	It's because probably 97 percent of it
164.062	is about men running
168.673	and men kicking things,
170.223	men trying to look
170.223	neatly packaged in Lycra.
173.141	There is --
174.324	(Laughter)
176.406	Not always successfully.
177.608	There is --
178.784	(Laughter)
179.84	There is so little
179.84	female sport on television,
184.097	that a young woman watching
184.097	might be forgiven for thinking,
187.002	and how can I put this nicely,
188.583	that the male member
188.583	is the very lever you need
191.204	to get yourself off the couch
191.204	and onto a sports ground.
194.833	(Laughter)
197.841	The inequalities in sport
197.841	are breathtaking.
201.83	So this is what happens to me:
203.291	I have a brand new idea,
204.475	and immediately I come back to an old one.
207.217	The fact is, there is not now,
209.329	nor has there ever been
209.329	in the whole of history,
212.776	a single country in the world
212.776	where women have equality with men.
218.666	Not one.
221.571	it hasn't happened
221.571	in the whole of evolution.
223.901	So, here is a picture of evolution.
225.895	(Laughter)
231.817	We women are not even in it!
233.849	(Laughter)
238.928	It's a wonder men have been able
238.928	to evolve quite so brilliantly.
242.682	So --
243.864	(Laughter)
244.897	It bugs me, and I know
244.897	I should do something about it.
248.647	But I'm busy, OK?
250.259	I have a full-on career,
251.455	I've got three kids,
251.455	I've got an elderly mom.
253.619	In fact, if I'm honest with you,
255.21	one of the reasons I came out here
256.877	is because TED Talks said
256.877	I could have 15 minutes to myself,
259.751	and I never have that much time --
261.516	(Laughter)
263.909	(Applause)
269.466	So I'm busy.
270.64	And anyway, I already had a go
270.64	at changing the world.
273.201	Here's the thing, OK?
274.383	Everybody has inside themselves
274.383	"what I call an ""activation button."""
277.563	It's the button that gets
277.563	pressed when you think,
279.973	"""I must do something about this."""
281.801	It gets pressed for all sorts of reasons.
284.047	Maybe you face some kind of inequality,
285.977	or you've come across
285.977	an injustice of some kind,
288.277	sometimes an illness strikes,
289.842	or you're born in some way disadvantaged,
292.26	or perhaps underprivileged.
294.101	So I was born gay, OK?
296.03	I've always known,
297.314	I don't think my family
297.314	were the least bit surprised.
300.835	Here is a picture of me aged four.
304.25	I look cute,
305.425	but inside I genuinely believed
305.425	that I looked like Clint Eastwood.
308.6	(Laughter)
315.907	So my activation button
315.907	was pressed when I had my kids --
318.889	three wonderful kids,
318.889	born to my then-partner.
322.919	Now here's the thing:
322.919	I work on television in Britain.
325.474	By the time they were born,
325.474	I was already hosting my own shows
328.439	and working in the public eye.
329.895	I love what I do,
331.07	but I love my kids more.
333.714	And I didn't want them
333.714	to grow up with a secret.
340.484	there was not, as far as I was aware,
342.58	a single out, gay woman
342.58	in British public life.
347.622	I don't think secrets are a good thing.
349.55	I think they are a cancer of the soul.
351.517	So I decided to come out.
354.108	Everybody warned me
354.108	that I would never work again,
356.506	but I decided it was
356.506	absolutely worth the risk.
360.578	Well, it was hell.
362.598	In Britain, we have a particularly vicious
362.598	section of the right-wing press,
367.188	and they went nuts.
368.775	And their hatred stirred up
368.775	the less stable elements of society,
373.23	and we got death threats --
374.884	enough death threats
374.884	that I had to take the kids into hiding,
377.818	and we had to have police protection.
380.766	And I promise you there were
380.766	many moments in the still of the night
385.144	when I was terrified by what I had done.
388.913	Eventually the dust settled.
390.481	Against all expectation
390.481	I carried on working,
393.832	and my kids were and continue
393.832	to be absolutely fantastic.
396.524	I remember when my son was six,
396.524	he had a friend over to play.
399.461	They were in the next room;
399.461	I could hear them chatting.
402.078	The friend said to my son,
402.078	"""What's it like having two mums?"""
404.935	I was a little anxious to hear,
404.935	so I leant in to hear and my son said,
408.253	"""It's fantastic,"
408.253	because if one of them's sick,
410.499	you've still got another one
410.499	"to cook for you."""
412.687	(Laughter)
417.422	So my activation button
417.422	for gay equality was pressed,
421.242	and along with many, many others,
423.47	I campaigned for years for gay rights,
425.915	and in particular, the right to marry
425.915	the person that I love.
429.106	In the end, we succeeded.
431.21	And in 2014, on the day
431.21	that the law was changed,
434.85	I married my wife,
434.85	who I love very much, indeed.
438.02	(Applause)
442.265	We didn't do it in a quiet way --
442.265	we did it on the stage
444.948	at the Royal Festival Hall in London.
447.212	It was a great event.
448.391	The hall seats two-and-a-half
448.391	thousand people.
450.567	We invited 150 family and friends,
450.567	then I let it be known to the public:
454.164	anybody who wanted to come and celebrate,
454.164	please come and join us.
457.401	It would be free to anybody
457.401	who wanted to come.
459.65	Two-and-half thousand people turned up.
461.796	(Applause)
466.192	Every kind of person you can imagine:
468.02	gays, straights, rabbis,
468.02	nuns, married people,
470.644	black, white -- the whole
470.644	of humanity was there.
473.223	And I remember standing
473.223	"on that stage thinking, ""How fantastic."
477.31	Job done.
478.58	Love triumphs.
479.967	"Law changed."""
481.403	And I --
482.585	(Applause)
485.961	And I genuinely thought
485.961	my activation days were over, OK?
488.672	So every year in that same hall,
491.109	I host a fantastic concert to celebrate
491.109	International Women's Day.
495.805	We gather the world's only
495.805	all-female orchestra,
499.003	we play fantastic music by forgotten
499.003	or overlooked women composers,
502.816	we have amazing conductors --
504.252	it's Marin Alsop there
504.252	from Baltimore conducting,
506.57	Petula Clark singing --
507.756	and I give a lecture on women's history.
511.02	I love to gather inspirational stories
511.02	from the past and pass them on.
514.869	Too often, I think history's what I call
514.869	the Mount Rushmore model.
518.717	It looks majestic, but the women
518.717	have been entirely left out of it.
523.663	And I was giving a talk in 2015
523.663	about the suffragettes --
527.118	I'm sure you know those magnificent
527.118	women who fought so hard
530.797	for the right for women
530.797	in Britain to vote.
533.931	"And their slogan was: ""Deeds, not words."""
537.29	And boy, they succeeded,
538.564	because women did indeed
538.564	get the vote in 1928.
541.468	So I'm giving this talk about this,
543.246	and as I'm talking, what I realized is:
545.866	this was not a history
545.866	lecture I was giving;
548.202	this was not something
548.202	where the job was done.
551.099	This was something where
551.099	there was so much left to do.
554.37	Nowhere in the world, for example,
556.35	do women have equal representation
556.35	in positions of power.
560.291	OK, let's take a very quick look
560.291	at the top 100 companies
563.553	in the London Stock Exchange in 2016.
566.244	Top 100 companies:
566.244	How many women running them?
570.191	Seven. OK. Seven.
570.191	That's all right, I suppose.
572.651	Until you realize that 17
572.651	"are run by men called ""John."""
577.436	(Laughter)
589.321	There are more men called John
589.321	running FTSE 100 companies --
593.269	(Laughter)
595.183	than there are women.
597.25	"There are 14 run by men called ""Dave."""
599.494	(Laughter)
603.06	Now, I'm sure Dave and John
603.06	are doing a bang-up job.
605.7	(Laughter)
607.012	OK. Why does it matter?
608.886	Well, it's that pesky business
608.886	of the gender pay gap.
613.209	Nowhere in the world
613.209	do women earn the same as men.
617.146	And that is never going to change
619.102	unless we have more women
619.102	at the top in the boardroom.
622.749	We have plenty of laws;
624.159	the Equal Pay Act in Britain
624.159	was passed in 1975.
628.563	Nevertheless, there are still
628.563	many, many women
631.144	who, from early November
631.144	until the end of the year,
634.205	by comparison to their male colleagues,
636.416	are effectively working for free.
639.64	In fact, the World Economic
639.64	Forum estimates
642.112	that women will finally
642.112	get equal pay in ...
647.901	Yay!
649.577	(Laughter)
655.206	That's a terrible figure.
656.672	And here's the thing:
657.916	the day before I came out to give my talk,
660.032	the World Economic Forum revised it.
661.808	So that's good, because
661.808	that's a terrible -- 2133.
664.192	Do you know what they revised it to?
667.155	(Laughter)
669.434	Yeah, another 53 years, OK?
672.365	We are not going to get equal pay
674.744	in my grandchildren's
674.744	grandchildren's lives
677.921	under the current system.
679.327	And I have waited long enough.
682.208	I've waited long enough
682.208	in my own business.
684.296	In 2016 I became the very
684.296	first woman on British television
688.334	to host a prime-time panel show.
690.97	Isn't that great? Wonderful, I'm thrilled.
693.03	But --
694.205	(Applause)
696.693	But 2016! The first!
698.873	Television's been around for 80 years!
700.859	(Laughter)
701.895	It may be television's not so important,
703.867	but it's kind of symptomatic, isn't it?
	for a brand new ambassador
709.861	to represent women's empowerment
709.861	and gender equality,
712.676	and who did they choose?
714.522	Wonder Woman.
716.311	Yes, they chose a cartoon, OK?
719.646	(Laughter)
721.181	Because no woman was up to the job.
725.718	The representation of women
725.718	in positions of power is shockingly low.
730.306	It's true in Congress, and it's certainly
730.306	true in the British Parliament.
733.807	In 2015, the number of men
733.807	elected to the Parliament that year
738.222	was greater than the total number of women
741.127	who have ever been members of Parliament.
744.231	And why does it matter?
745.414	Here's the thing:
745.414	if they're not at the table --
747.701	literally, in Britain, at that table
747.701	helping to make the laws --
750.821	do not be surprised if the female
750.821	perspective is overlooked.
755.416	It's a great role model for young people
755.416	to see a woman in charge.
758.772	In 2016, Britain got its second
758.772	female Prime Minister;
761.885	Theresa May came to power.
763.548	The day she came to power
763.548	she was challenged:
765.776	just do one thing.
766.994	Do one thing in the first
770.006	to try and improve
770.006	lives for women in Britain.
772.971	And what did she do? Nothing.
775.134	Nothing.
776.317	Because she's much too busy
776.317	cleaning up the mess the boys made.
780.492	Even having a female leader,
782.389	they always find something better to do
785.407	than to sort out the pesky
785.407	issue of inequality.
788.718	So I keep talking about equality
788.718	like it matters. Does it?
791.584	Well, let's take a very quick look
791.584	at the STEM industries, OK?
794.905	So science, technology,
794.905	engineering and mathematics.
797.496	Pretty much important in every
797.496	single aspect of our daily lives.
802.137	There is the thickest and most incredibly
802.137	well-documented glass ceiling
808.465	in the STEM industries.
810.504	What if the cure for cancer
812.512	or the answer the global warming
814.137	lies in the head of a young female
814.137	scientist who fails to progress?
819.721	So I thought all these things,
822.577	"and I knew I had to do ""Deeds, not words."""
827.968	And I spoke to my wonderful friend,
829.963	brilliant journalist
829.963	Catherine Mayer in Britain,
832.714	and we rather foolishly --
834.188	and I suspect there was wine involved --
837.414	(Laughter)
839.192	We decided to found
839.192	a brand new political party.
842.861	Because here's the critical thing:
844.511	the one place women and men
844.511	are absolutely equal is at the ballot box.
849.804	We had no idea what we were doing,
851.449	we didn't know how complicated
851.449	it was to start a political party.
854.571	"I thought, ""It can't be that difficult,"
854.571	"men have been doing it for years."""
858.13	(Laughter)
860.311	So we started by calling it
860.311	"""The Women's Equality Party."""
866.143	And straightaway people said to me,
867.868	"""Why did you call it that?"""
869.84	"I said, ""I don't know,"
869.84	"I just thought we'd be clear."""
872.946	(Laughter)
879.878	I didn't want what we were doing
879.878	to be a secret, you know? I just --
883.331	(Laughter)
884.648	"Some people said, ""You can't call it that!"
884.648	"It's much too feminist!"""
887.898	Ooh! Scary word! Ahh!
890.149	I can't tell you how many times
890.149	I've heard somebody say,
893.28	"""I'm not a feminist, but ..."""
895.829	And I always think
895.829	"if there's a ""but"" in the sentence,"
898.464	it can't all be roses in the garden.
900.611	And then I started getting asked
900.611	the hilarious question,
903.285	"""Are you all going to burn your bras?"""
905.966	Yes! Because bras are famously
905.966	made of flammable material.
909.605	(Laughter)
912.032	That's why all women spark when they walk.
914.874	(Laughter)
919.738	Here's quick history sidebar for you:
923.062	no woman ever burnt her bra in the '60s.
925.621	It's a story made up by a journalist.
927.467	Thank goodness journalism
927.467	has improved since then.
930.116	So --
931.295	(Laughter)
933.018	I announced what we were going
933.018	to do in a broadcast interview,
935.96	and straightaway,
935.96	the emails started coming.
938.086	First hundreds,
938.086	then thousands and thousands,
940.353	from every age group: from the very young
940.353	to women in their '90s,
944.177	to hundreds of wonderful men.
945.583	People wrote and said,
945.583	"""Please, can I help?"
947.619	Please, can I visit you
947.619	"at party headquarters?"""
949.859	We didn't have a headquarters --
949.859	we didn't have a party!
952.551	We didn't have anything.
953.773	All we had was a wonderful,
953.773	tight group of fabulous friends
957.696	trying to answer emails
957.696	pretty much 24-7 in our pajamas.
963.091	We were all busy.
964.266	Many of us had careers,
964.266	many of us had children,
966.576	but we did what women do,
966.576	and we shared the work.
969.335	And almost instantly, we agreed
969.335	on certain fundamental things.
972.797	First thing: we want to be
972.797	the only political party in the world
976.313	whose main aim was
976.313	to no longer need to exist.
979.042	That's a fantastic idea.
980.871	We wanted to be the only political party
980.871	with no particular political leaning.
984.725	We wanted people from the left,
984.725	from the right, from the middle,
987.846	every age group.
989.022	Because the whole point
989.022	was to work with a simple agenda:
991.861	let's get equality
991.861	in every aspect of our lives,
995.104	and when we're finished,
996.284	let's go home and get
996.284	the other chores done.
998.543	(Laughter)
999.649	And we wanted to change
999.649	how politics is conducted.
1002.08	I don't know if you have this,
1003.587	but in Britain we have
1003.587	two major political parties.
1006.048	They're the dinosaurs of politics.
1007.72	And how they speak to each other
1007.72	is shameful and poisonous.
1011.735	I'm sure you've never had
1011.735	that kind of name-calling --
1014.377	(Laughter)
1016.546	And lying here.
1019.067	Wouldn't it be great
1019.067	if just one politician said,
1021.46	"""Do you know, my opponent has a point."
1023.379	Let's see if we can't work together
1023.379	"and get the job done."""
1026.802	(Applause)
1033.163	And let's get more women
1033.163	into politics, OK?
1035.6	Let's immediately get
1035.6	more women into politics
1037.798	by being the only political party
1037.798	to offer free childcare to our candidates,
1041.508	so they can get out of the house
1041.508	and start campaigning.
1044.205	(Applause)
1047.596	Within 10 months,
1050.046	we had more than 70 branches
1050.046	of our party across the UK.
1054.018	We stood candidates for election
1054.018	in London, Scotland and Wales
1057.201	in May 2016.
1058.789	One in 20 people voted
1058.789	for our candidate for London Mayor.
1062.358	And when the men in the race
1062.358	saw how many votes we were attracting,
1067.575	wonder of wonders,
1068.773	they began to talk about the need
1068.773	to tackle gender equality.
1073.127	(Applause)
1079.588	You know, I've been promised
1079.588	change since I was a child.
1082.26	It was always coming:
1083.341	women were going to stand
1083.341	shoulder to shoulder with men.
1086.063	All I got were empty promises
1086.063	and disappointment --
1088.57	enough disappointment
1088.57	to found a political party.
1091.964	But here is my new idea for today --
1091.964	this is my five percent, OK?
1095.094	And this one is really good.
1096.717	The fact is, this is not enough.
1099.487	It is not enough to found one political
1099.487	party for equality in a single country.
1104.573	What we need is a seismic change
1104.573	in the global political landscape.
1109.144	And the wonderful thing
1109.144	about the model we have created
1111.862	is that it would work anywhere.
1113.761	It would work in America,
1115.445	it would work in Australia,
1115.445	it would work in India.
1117.863	It's like we've made the perfect recipe:
1117.863	anybody can cook it,
1120.794	and it's good for everybody.
1122.214	And we want to give it away.
1123.861	If you want to know what we did,
1123.861	we're giving it away.
1126.603	Can you imagine if we could mobilize
1126.603	millions of women across the world
1132.241	"to say, ""That's enough!"""
1132.241	to the traditional battles of politics?
1135.583	"To say, ""Stop the bickering,"
1135.583	"let's get the work done."""
1138.641	We could literally change the world.
1141.972	And I want that.
1143.413	(Applause)
1148.707	I want ...
1150.104	(Applause)
1152.044	I want that for our daughters,
1154.538	and I want it for our sons.
1156.065	Because the fact is:
1156.065	equality is better for everyone.
1160.481	Come on people, let's activate!
1160.481	Let's change the world!
1163.436	I know we can do it, and it wants doing!
1166.316	(Applause)
