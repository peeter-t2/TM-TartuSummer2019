12.906	I've been intrigued by this question
15.091	of whether we could evolve
15.091	or develop a sixth sense --
19.542	a sense that would give us seamless access
23.16	and easy access to meta-information
23.16	or information that may exist somewhere
29.16	that may be relevant to help us
29.16	make the right decision
32.16	about whatever it is
32.16	that we're coming across.
36.024	And some of you may argue,
38.16	"""Well, don't today's cell phones"
38.16	"do that already?"""
41.446	But I would say no.
43.16	When you meet someone here at TED --
45.16	and this is the top networking place,
45.16	of course, of the year --
49.223	you don't shake somebody's hand
51.105	and then say,
51.105	"""Can you hold on for a moment"
53.16	"while I take out my phone and Google you?"""
56.27	Or when you go to the supermarket
59.16	and you're standing there
59.16	in that huge aisle
61.993	of different types of toilet papers,
64.533	you don't take out your cell phone,
64.533	and open a browser,
68.16	and go to a website to try to decide
68.16	which of these different toilet papers
73.16	is the most ecologically
73.16	responsible purchase to make.
77.244	So we don't really have easy access
77.244	to all this relevant information
81.16	that can just help us
81.16	make optimal decisions
85.154	about what to do next
85.154	and what actions to take.
88.331	And so my research group at the Media Lab
91.16	has been developing a series of inventions
96.044	to give us access to this information
96.044	in a sort of easy way,
100.645	without requiring that the user
100.645	changes any of their behavior.
105.641	And I'm here to unveil our latest effort,
110.16	and most successful effort so far,
112.16	which is still very much
112.16	a work in process.
114.994	I'm actually wearing the device right now
114.994	and we've sort of cobbled it together
120.16	with components that are off the shelf --
123.842	and that, by the way, only cost
128.762	I'm wearing a camera,
128.762	just a simple web cam,
132.742	a portable, battery-powered
132.742	projection system with a little mirror.
138.514	These components communicate
138.514	to my cell phone in my pocket
142.609	which acts as the communication
142.609	and computation device.
146.914	And in the video here we see
146.914	my student Pranav Mistry,
150.858	who's really the genius
150.858	who's been implementing
153.16	and designing this whole system.
155.551	And we see how this system
155.551	lets him walk up to any surface
161.16	and start using his hands
161.16	to interact with the information
165.16	that is projected in front of him.
167.876	The system tracks
167.876	the four significant fingers.
171.998	In this case, he's wearing
171.998	simple marker caps
175.688	that you may recognize.
177.16	But if you want a more stylish version,
179.874	you could also paint your nails
179.874	in different colors.
183.575	And the camera basically
183.575	tracks these four fingers
187.16	and recognizes any gestures
187.16	that he's making
191.023	so he can just go to,
191.023	for example, a map of Long Beach,
195.549	zoom in and out, etc.
197.811	The system also recognizes iconic gestures
197.811	"such as the ""take a picture"" gesture,"
203.929	and then takes a picture
203.929	of whatever is in front of you.
207.371	And when he then walks
207.371	back to the Media Lab,
210.16	he can just go up to any wall
212.629	and project all the pictures
212.629	that he's taken,
215.565	sort through them and organize them,
215.565	and re-size them, etc.,
219.16	again using all natural gestures.
223.008	So, some of you most likely
223.008	were here two years ago
227.091	and saw the demo by Jeff Han,
227.091	or some of you may think,
231.369	"""Well, doesn't this look like"
231.369	"the Microsoft Surface Table?"""
234.764	And yes, you also interact
234.764	using natural gestures,
239.16	both hands, etc.
241.16	But the difference here
241.16	is that you can use any surface,
244.16	you can walk up to any surface,
247.16	including your hand,
247.16	if nothing else is available,
250.16	and interact with this projected data.
253.681	The device is completely
253.681	portable, and can be --
258.16	(Applause)
263.728	(Applause ends)
265.565	So, one important difference
265.565	is that it's totally mobile.
269.16	Another even more important
269.16	difference is that in mass production,
273.918	this would not cost more tomorrow
273.918	than today's cell phones
277.607	and would actually not
277.607	sort of be a bigger packaging --
281.609	could look a lot more stylish
283.655	than this version
283.655	that I'm wearing around my neck.
288.293	But other than letting some of you
288.293	live out your fantasy
293.063	of looking as cool as Tom Cruise
293.063	"in ""Minority Report,"""
297.018	the reason why we're really
297.018	excited about this device
301.06	is that it really can act
301.06	as one of these sixth-sense devices
306.916	that gives you relevant information
306.916	about whatever is in front of you.
312.192	So we see Pranav here
312.192	going into the supermarket
316.16	and he's shopping for some paper towels.
319.524	And, as he picks up a product,
321.452	the system can recognize
321.452	the product that he's picking up,
324.53	using either image recognition
324.53	or marker technology,
328.79	and give him the green light
328.79	or an orange light.
331.788	He can ask for additional information.
334.722	So this particular choice here
338.507	is a particularly good choice,
338.507	given his personal criteria.
342.16	Some of you may want the toilet paper
342.16	with the most bleach in it
346.16	rather than the most ecologically
346.16	responsible choice.
349.755	(Laughter)
352.932	If he picks up a book in the bookstore,
352.932	he can get an Amazon rating --
357.664	it gets projected
357.664	right on the cover of the book.
360.3	This is Juan's book, our previous speaker,
364.16	which gets a great rating,
364.16	by the way, at Amazon.
366.892	And so, Pranav turns the page of the book
369.16	and can then see additional
369.16	information about the book --
372.916	reader comments, maybe sort of information
372.916	by his favorite critic, etc.
379.16	If he turns to a particular page,
381.16	he finds an annotation by maybe
381.16	an expert or a friend of ours
385.477	that gives him a little bit
385.477	of additional information
388.323	about whatever is on that particular page.
391.372	Reading the newspaper --
391.372	it never has to be outdated.
395.773	(Laughter)
397.16	You can get video annotations
397.16	of the events that you're reading about.
401.973	You can get the latest sports scores, etc.
406.044	This is a more controversial one.
408.16	(Laughter)
409.835	As you interact with someone at TED,
412.16	maybe you can see
412.16	a word cloud of the tags,
416.16	the words that are associated
416.16	with that person
418.912	in their blog and personal web pages.
421.684	In this case, the student
421.684	is interested in cameras, etc.
426.861	On your way to the airport,
428.841	if you pick up your boarding pass, it can
428.841	tell you that your flight is delayed,
432.934	that the gate has changed, etc.
435.594	And, if you need to know
435.594	what the current time is,
438.738	it's as simple as drawing a watch --
442.16	(Laughter)
443.389	(Applause)
444.548	on your arm.
447.774	So that's where we're at so far
447.774	in developing this sixth sense
454.16	that would give us seamless access
454.16	to all this relevant information
458.91	about the things that we may come across.
461.752	My student Pranav, who's really,
461.752	like I said, the genius behind this.
466.17	(Applause and cheering)
487.005	(Applause ends)
488.16	He does deserve a lot of applause,
491.16	because I don't think he's slept much
491.16	in the last three months, actually.
495.532	And his girlfriend is probably
495.532	not very happy about him either.
498.958	But it's not perfect yet,
498.958	it's very much a work in progress.
503.837	And who knows, maybe in another 10 years
506.794	we'll be here with the ultimate
506.794	sixth sense brain implant.
511.16	Thank you.
512.231	(Applause)
