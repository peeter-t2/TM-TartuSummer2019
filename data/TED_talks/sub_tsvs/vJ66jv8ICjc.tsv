15.92	I'm going to tell you about why I became a sculptor,
20.041	and you may think that sculptors,
22.096	well, they deal with meta, they deal with objects,
27.385	they deal with bodies,
30.343	but I think, really, what I care about most
34.886	is making space, and that's what I've called this talk:
38.934	Making Space.
41.541	Space that exists within us,
45.949	and without us.
48.018	So, when I was a child,
52.187	I don't know how many of you grew up in the '50s,
54.198	but I was sent upstairs for an enforced rest. (Laughter)
59.61	It's a really bad idea. I mean, after lunch, you're, you know,
62.957	you're six, and you want to go and climb a tree.
66.037	But I had to go upstairs, this tiny little room
67.926	that was actually made out of an old balcony,
69.701	so it was incredibly hot, small and light,
74.856	and I had to lie there. It was ridiculous.
78.271	But anyway, for some reason, I promised myself
80.879	that I wasn't going to move,
83.132	that I was going to do this thing that Mummy
85.069	wanted me to do.
86.996	And there I was, lying there in this tiny space,
90.669	hot, dark, claustrophobic, matchbox-sized, behind my eyes,
97.059	but it was really weird, like, after this went on
101.124	for days, weeks, months, that space would get bigger
107.837	and darker and cooler
111.501	until I really looked forward to that half an hour
116.371	of enforced immobility and rest,
120.478	and I really looked forward to going to that place
125.132	of darkness.
127.694	Do you mind if we do something completely different?
130.15	Can we all just close our eyes for a minute?
132.186	Now, this isn't going to be freaky.
133.834	It isn't some cultic thing. (Laughter)
135.456	It's just, it's just, I just would like us all to go there.
138.704	So I'm going to do it too. We'll all be there together.
140.852	So close your eyes for a minute.
144.687	Here we are, in a space,
147.797	the subjective, collective space of the darkness of the body.
155.269	I think of this as the place of imagination,
159.324	of potential,
162.624	but what are its qualities?
165.524	It is objectless. There are no things in it.
170.821	It is dimensionless. It is limitless.
176.772	It is endless.
181.362	Okay, open your eyes.
183.908	That's the space that I think sculpture --
188.117	which is a bit of a paradox, sculpture that is about
191.185	making material propositions --
194.529	but I think that's the space
196.65	that sculpture can connect us with.
201.318	So, imagine we're in the middle of America.
205.503	You're asleep. You wake up,
208.375	and without lifting your head from the earth
211.722	on your sleeping bag, you can see for 70 miles.
217.16	This is a dry lake bed.
220.411	I was young. I'd just finished art school.
224.653	I wanted to do something that was working
226.825	directly with the world, directly with place.
231.977	This was a wonderful place, because it was a place
235.04	where you could imagine that you were the
237.257	first person to be there.
239.591	It was a place where nothing very much had happened.
244.5	Anyway, bear with me.
247.745	I picked up a hand-sized stone,
251.53	threw it as far as I was able,
253.623	it was about 22 meters.
255.694	I then cleared all the stones within that radius
262.032	and made a pile.
265.834	And that was the pile, by the way.
268.238	And then, I stood on the pile,
271.735	and threw all of those rocks out again,
275.604	and here is rearranged desert.
280.822	You could say, well, it doesn't look very different
282.8	from when he started.
284.919	(Laughter)
286.122	What's all the fuss about?
287.756	In fact, Chris was worried and said,
289.124	"""Look, don't show them that slide,"
290.518	because they're just going to think you're another one of
292.477	those crazy modern artists who doesn't do much.
295.143	(Laughter)
297.513	But the fact is, this is evidence
304.222	of a living body on other bodies,
307.757	rocks that have been the subject of geological formation,
313.596	erosion, the action of time on objects.
318.61	This is a place, in a way, that I just
321.132	would like you to, in a way, look at differently
324.613	because of this event that has happened in it,
328.284	a human event,
330.339	and in general, it just asks us to look again
333.891	at this world, so different from, in a way,
336.45	the world that we have been sharing with each other,
339.721	the technological world,
342.147	to look again at the elemental world.
346.841	The elemental world that we all live in is that space
352.55	that we all visited together, the darkness of the body.
356.938	I wanted to start again with that environment,
360.603	the environment of the intimate, subjective space
364.273	that each of us lives in, but from the other side
368.099	of appearance.
370.707	So here is a daily activity of the studio.
373.131	You can see I don't do much. I'm just standing there,
376.77	again with my eyes closed, and other people
379.497	are molding me, evidential.
384.024	This is an indexical register of a lived moment
387.672	of a body in time.
390.855	Can we map that space, using the language of neutrinos
396.578	or cosmic rays, taking the bounding condition of the body
401.364	as its limit, but in complete reversal of, in a way,
406.839	the most traditional Greek idea of pointing?
409.462	In the old days they used to take a lump of Pentelic marble
413.25	and drill from the surface in order to identify the skin,
417.908	the appearance,
419.36	what Aristotle defined as the distinction
422.621	between substance and appearance,
424.644	the thing that makes things visible,
427.711	but here we're working from the other side.
430.766	Or can we do it as an exclusive membrane?
434.811	This is a lead case made around the space
440.769	that my body occupied, but it's now void.
444.234	"This is a work called ""Learning To See."""
448.108	It's a bit of, well, we could call it night,
454.392	we could call it the 96 percent of gravity
458.842	that we don't know about, dark matter,
462.403	placed in space, anyway, another version of a human space
465.948	in space at large, but I don't know if you can see,
468.861	the eyes are indicated, they're closed.
474.93	"It's called ""Learning To See"" because it's about an object"
478.393	that hopefully works reflexively and talks about that
482.725	vision or connection with the darkness of the body
486.544	that I see as a space of potential.
491.517	Can we do it another way, using the language
494.592	of particles around a nucleus, and talk about the body
497.778	as an energy center?
499.708	No longer about statues, no longer having to take that
502.766	duty of standing, the standing of a human body,
505.827	or the standing of a statue, release it,
509.157	allow it to be an energy field, a space in space
513.415	that talks about human life, between becoming an entropy
520.236	as a sort of concentration of attention,
524.98	a human place of possibility in space at large.
530.049	Is there another way?
533.825	Dark matter now placed against a horizon.
539.924	If minds live in bodies, if bodies live in clothes,
543.959	and then in rooms, and then in buildings,
547.089	and then in cities, do they also have a final skin,
552.791	and is that skin perceptual?
555.424	The horizon.
558.046	And is art about
560.547	trying to imagine what lies beyond the horizon?
566.491	Can we use, in a way, a body as an empty catalyst
575.112	for a kind of empathy with the experience
579.863	of space-time as it is lived, as I am standing here
585.211	in front of you trying to feel and make a connection
590.605	in this space-time that we are sharing,
593.911	can we use, at it were, the memory of a body,
597.467	of a human space in space to catalyze
600.291	an experience, again, firsthand experience,
604.014	of elemental time.
607.021	Human time, industrial time, tested against
611.545	the time of the tides, in which these memories
614.541	of a particular body, that could be any body,
619.5	multiplied as in the time of mechanical reproduction,
624.39	many times, placed over three square miles,
628.775	a mile out to sea,
632.429	disappearing, in different conditions of day and night.
636.784	You can see this work. It's on the mouth of the Mersey,
640.053	just outside Liverpool.
643.21	And there you can see what a Liverpool sea looks like
646.675	on a typical afternoon.
649.501	The pieces appear and disappear,
652.203	but maybe more importantly --
654.266	this is just looking north from the center of the installation --
658.199	they create a field, a field that involves
662.536	living and the surrogate bodies in a kind of relation,
668.298	a relation with each other and a relation with that limit,
673.259	the edge, the horizon.
677.005	Just moving on, is it possible,
679.507	taking that idea of mind, body, body-building,
684.19	to supplant the first body,
687.595	the biological body, with the second,
689.575	the body of architecture and the built environment.
692.493	"This is a work called ""Room for the Great Australian Desert."""
697.084	It's in an undefined location
698.702	and I've never published where it is.
701.783	It's an object for the mind.
703.673	I think of it as a 21st-century Buddha.
707.094	Again, the darkness of the body,
709.024	now held within this bunker shape
712.087	of the minimum position that a body needs to occupy,
715.571	a crouching body.
717.687	There's a hole at the anus, penis level.
720.674	There are holes at ears. There are no holes at the eyes.
723.411	There's a slot for the mouth. It's two and a half inches thick,
727.665	concrete with a void interior.
730.004	Again, a site found with a completely flat
738.883	This is just simply asking, again,
743.207	as if we had arrived for the first time,
747.795	what is the relationship of the human project
751.931	to time and space?
756.044	Taking that idiom of, as it were,
759.617	the darkness of the body transferred to architecture,
764.61	can you use architectural space not for living
768.185	but as a metaphor,
769.898	and use its systolic, diastolic
773.675	smaller and larger spaces to provide a kind of
778.494	firsthand somatic narrative for a journey through space,
784.166	light and darkness?
787.462	This is a work of some proportion and some weight
792.984	that makes the body into a city, an aggregation of cells
797.87	that are all interconnected
800.282	and that allow certain visual access
805.114	at certain places.
807.913	The last work that I just wanted to share with you
814.616	"is ""Blind Light,"" which is perhaps"
818.418	the most open work,
821.678	and in a conference of radical openness,
823.813	I think maybe this is as radical as I get,
827.821	using light and water vapor as my materials.
832.084	Here is a box
834.47	filled at one and a half atmospheres of atmospheric pressure,
838.012	with a cloud and with very bright light.
842.051	As you walk towards the ever-open threshold,
845.472	you disappear, both to yourselves and to others.
853.384	If you hold your hand out in front of you,
855.54	you can't see it.
857.394	If you look down, you can't see your feet.
860.66	You are now consciousness without an object,
867.662	freed from the dimensionful
871.555	and measured way in which life links us
877.441	to the obligatory.
880.531	But this is a space that is actually filled with people,
885.508	disembodied voices,
887.478	and out of that ambient environment,
891.592	when people come close to your own body zone,
895.522	very close, they appear to you as representations.
899.585	When they appear close to the edge,
901.805	they are representations, representations in which
906.389	the viewers have become the viewed.
910.257	For me, art is not about objects of high monetary exchange.
916.108	It's about reasserting our firsthand experience
921.513	in present time.
924.404	As John Cage said,
927.845	"""We are not moving towards some kind of goal."
932.932	We are at the goal, and it is changing with us.
937.613	"If art has any purpose, it is to open our eyes to that fact."""
944.049	Thank you very much.
946.086	(Applause)
