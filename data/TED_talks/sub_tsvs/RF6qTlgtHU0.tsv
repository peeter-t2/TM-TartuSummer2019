15.686	Good afternoon.
17.007	I am not a farmer.
19.95	(Laughter)
20.885	I'm not. I'm a parent, I'm a resident and I'm a teacher.
24.437	And this is my world.
25.999	And along the way I've started noticing --
27.612	I'm on my third generation of kids --
29.081	that they're getting bigger.
30.334	They're getting sicker.
31.493	In addition to these complexities,
33.477	I just learned that 70 percent of the kids that I see
35.39	who are labeled learning disabled would not have been
37.4	had they had proper prenatal nutrition.
39.757	The realities of my community are simple. They look like this.
43.433	Kids should not have to grow up and look at things like this.
46.167	And as jobs continue to leave my community,
48.309	and energy continues to come in, be exported in,
51.252	it's no wonder that really some people refer to the South Bronx as a desert.
56.587	But I'm the oldest sixth grader you'll ever meet,
59.187	so I get up every day with this tremendous amount of enthusiasm
61.82	that I'm hoping to share with you all today.
64.156	And with that note, I come to you with this belief
67.633	that kids should not have to leave their communities
70.107	to live, learn and earn in a better one.
71.488	So I'm here to tell you a story about me
73.126	and this wall that I met outside, which I'm now bringing inside.
76.647	And it starts with three people.
78.39	The crazy teacher -- that's me on the left,
80.468	I dress up pretty, thank you, my wife, I love you for getting a good suit --
83.846	my passionate borough president
85.51	and a guy named George Irwin from Green Living Technologies
88.055	who helped me with my class
89.319	and helped me get involved with this patented technology.
91.806	But it all starts with seeds in classrooms,
94.67	in my place, which looks like this.
97.326	And I'm here today hoping that my reach will exceed my grasp.
102.979	And that's really what this is all about.
104.678	And it starts with incredible kids like this,
106.414	who come early and stay late.
108.135	All of my kids are either IEP or ELL learners,
111.103	most come with a lot of handicaps,
112.862	most are homeless and many are in foster care.
115.415	Almost all of my kids live below poverty.
117.666	But with those seeds, from day one, we are growing in my classroom,
121.087	and this is what it looks like in my classroom.
123.278	And you see how attentive these kids are to these seeds.
125.879	And then you notice that those seeds become farms across the Bronx that look like this.
130.318	But again, I am not a farmer. I'm a teacher.
134.535	And I don't like weeding, and I don't like back-breaking labor.
137.191	So I wanted to figure out how I could get this kind of success
139.319	into something small, like this,
141.687	and bring it into my classroom so that handicapped kids could do it,
144.479	kids who didn't want to be outside could do it,
146.201	and everyone could have access.
147.501	So I called George Irwin, and what do you know?
149.634	He came to my class and we built an indoor edible wall.
153.295	And what we do is we partner it with authentic learning experiences,
156.643	private-based learning.
158.35	And lo and behold, we gave birth to
160.974	the first edible wall in New York City.
163.222	So if you're hungry, get up and eat.
164.382	You can do it right now. My kids play cow all the time.
166.206	Okay? But we were just getting started,
169.558	the kids loved the technology,
170.927	"so we called up George and we said, ""We gotta learn more!"""
173.272	Now, Mayor Bloomberg, thank you very much, we no longer need work permits,
176.127	which comes with slices and bonded contractors -- we're available for you --
178.904	We decided to go to Boston.
180.91	And my kids, from the poorest congressional district in America,
183.336	became the first to install a green wall,
186.601	designed by a computer, with real-live learning tools,
190.435	it's on top of the John Hancock building.
192.494	But closer to home, we started installing these walls in schools
195.286	that look like this with lighting like that,
197.206	real LED stuff, 21st-century technology.
200.295	And what do you know? We made 21st century money,
202.614	and that was groundbreaking. Wow!
205.433	This is my harvest, people.
208.245	And what do you do with this food? You cook it!
211.002	And those are my heirloom students making heirloom sauce,
213.906	with plastic forks, and we get it into the cafeteria,
216.368	and we grow stuff and we feed our teachers.
218.568	And that is the youngest nationally certified
220.779	workforce in America with our Bronx Borough President.
223.602	And what'd we do then? Well, I met nice people like you,
226.506	and they invited us to the Hamptons.
228.243	"So I call this ""from South Bronx to Southampton."""
230.514	And we started putting in roofs that look like this,
233.019	and we came in from destitute neighborhoods
235.307	to start building landscape like this, wow! People noticed.
238.875	And so we got invited back this past summer,
240.869	and we actually moved into the Hamptons,
242.628	payed 3,500 dollars a week for a house, and we learned how to surf.
245.451	And when you can do stuff like this --
248.227	These are my kids putting in this technology,
251.443	and when you can build a roof that looks like that
253.98	on a house that looks like that
256.394	with sedum that looks like this,
259.204	this is the new green graffiti.
261.946	So, you may wonder what does a wall like this
265.451	really do for kids, besides changing landscapes and mindsets?
268.011	Okay, I'm going to tell you what it does.
269.907	It gets me to meet incredible contractors like this,
272.227	Jim Ellenberger from Ellenberger Services.
274.379	And this is where it becomes true triple bottom line.
277.112	Because Jim realized that these kids, my future farmers,
280.601	really had the skills he needed to build affordable housing
283.485	for New Yorkers, right in their own neighborhood.
285.683	And this is what my kids are doing, making living wage.
288.027	Now, if you're like me, you live in a building, there are seven guys
290.867	out of work looking to manage a million dollars.
292.882	I don't have it. But if you need a toilet fixed
295.291	or, you know, some shelving, I gotta wait six months
297.302	for an appointment with someone who drives a much nicer car than me.
299.755	That's the beauty of this economy.
301.534	But my kids are now licensed and bonded in trade.
304.868	And that's my first student to open up, the first in his family to have a bank account.
307.844	This immigrant student is the first one in his family to use an ATM.
311.253	And this is the true triple bottom line,
313.635	because we can take neighborhoods that were abandoned and destitute
315.89	and turn them into something like this with interiors like this.
318.811	Wow! People noticed. And notice they did.
320.89	So CNN called, and we were delighted to have them come to our farmer's market.
324.386	And then when Rockefeller Center said, NBC,
326.954	could you put this thing up on the walls? We were delighted.
328.858	But this, I show you, when kids from the poorest congressional district in America
332.85	can build a 30-foot by 15-foot wall,
335.57	design it, plant it and install it in the heart of New York City,
338.735	"that's a true ""s√≠ se puede"" moment."
340.754	Really scholastic, if you ask me.
343.139	But this is not a Getty image.
345.41	That's a picture I took of my Bronx Borough President,
347.986	addressing my kids in his house, not the jailhouse,
351.201	making them feel a part of it.
352.748	That's our State Senator Gustavo Rivera and Bob Bieder,
355.102	coming to my classroom to make my kids feel important.
357.702	And when the Bronx Borough President shows up
359.42	and the State Senator comes to our class,
361.602	believe you me, the Bronx can change attitudes now.
365.346	We are poised, ready, willing and able
366.868	to export our talent and diversity in ways we've never even imagined.
370.068	And when the local senator gets on the scale in public
372.134	and says he's got to lose weight, so do I!
375.347	And I tell you what, I'm doing it and so are the kids.
378.212	Okay? And then celebrities started.
380.29	Produce Pete can't believe what we grow.
382.306	Lorna Sass came and donated books.
384.522	Okay? We're feeding seniors.
386.754	And when we realized that we were growing for food justice in the South Bronx,
390.315	so did the international community.
392.2	And my kids in the South Bronx were repped in
393.77	the first international green roof conference.
395.946	And that's just great.
397.378	Except what about locally?
398.989	Well, we met this woman, Avis Richards, with the Ground Up Campaign.
402.053	Unbelievable! Through her, my kids,
404.413	the most disenfranchised and marginalized,
406.541	were able to roll out 100 gardens to New York City public schools.
410.31	That's triple bottom line! Okay?
413.167	A year ago today, I was invited to the New York Academy of Medicine.
416.102	I thought this concept of designing a strong and healthy New York
419.566	made sense, especially when the resources were free.
422.277	So thank you all and I love them.
424.053	They introduced me to the New York City Strategic Alliance for Health,
427.071	again, free resources, don't waste them.
430.035	And what do you know? Six months later,
432.181	my school and my kids were awarded the first ever
435.28	high school award of excellence for creating a healthy school environment.
438.967	The greenest class in New York City.
441.093	But more importantly is my kids learned to get,
443.535	they learned to give.
445.168	And we took the money that we made from our farmer's market,
447.637	and started buying gifts for the homeless
449.085	and for needy around the world.
450.525	So we started giving back.
451.935	And that's when I realized that the greening of America
454.434	starts first with the pockets, then with the heart
457.669	and then with the mind.
458.887	So we were onto something, and we're still onto something.
461.218	And thank God Trinity Wall Street noticed,
463.052	because they gave us the birth of Green Bronx Machine.
466.285	We're 3,000 strong right now.
468.092	And what does it really do?
469.413	It teaches kids to re-vision their communities,
471.447	so when they grow up in places like this, they can imagine it like this.
474.493	And my kids, trained and certified --
476.636	Ma, you get the tax abatement. Thank you, Mayor Bloomberg --
478.628	can take communities that look like this and convert them into things that look like that,
482.335	"and that to me, people, is another true ""s√≠ se puede"" moment."
485.724	Now, how does it start? It starts in schools.
487.804	No more little Knicks and little Nets.
489.524	Group by broccoli, group by your favorite vegetable,
492.934	something you can aspire to.
494.565	Okay? And these are my future farmers of America,
496.612	growing up in Brook Park on 141st Street,
499.085	the most migrant community in America.
500.812	When tenacious little ones learn how to garden like this,
502.9	it's no wonder we get fruit like that.
505.261	And I love it! And so do they.
507.252	And we're building teepees in neighborhoods that were burning down.
510.167	"And that's a true ""s√≠ se puede"" moment."
512.54	And again, Brook Park feeds hundreds of people
515.917	without a food stamp or a fingerprint.
518.335	The poorest congressional district in America,
520.388	the most migratory community in America, we can do this.
523.572	Bissel Gardens is cranking out food in epic proportions,
527.276	moving kids into an economy they never imagined.
529.58	Now, somewhere over the rainbow, my friends,
532.044	is the South Bronx of America. And we're doing it.
535.772	How does it start? Well, look at Jose's attention to detail.
538.627	Thank God Omar knows that carrots come from the ground,
541.268	and not aisle 9 at the supermarket
542.844	or through a bullet-proof window or through a piece of styrofoam.
545.635	And when Henry knows that green is good, so do I.
548.335	And when you expand their palates, you expand their vocabulary.
551.389	And most importantly, when you put big kids together with little kids,
555.022	you get the big fat white guy out of the middle, which is cool,
557.369	and you create this kind of accountability amongst peers, which is incredible.
560.801	God, I'm going to run out of time, so I've gotta keep it moving.
563.39	But this is my weekly paycheck for kids; that's our green graffiti.
566.59	This is what we're doing.
568.255	And behold the glory and bounty that is Bronx County.
572.734	Nothing thrills me more than to see kids pollinating plants instead of each other.
576.077	I gotta tell you, I'm a protective parent.
578.237	But those kids are the kids who are now putting
579.778	pumpkin patches on top of trains.
581.654	We're also designing coin ponds for the rich and affluent.
584.495	We're also becoming children of the corn,
586.201	creating farms in the middle of Fordham Road for awareness
588.805	and window bottles out of garbage.
590.358	Now I don't expect every kid to be a farmer,
592.157	but I expect you to read about it, write about it, blog about it, offer outstanding customer service.
595.518	I expect them to be engaged, and man, are they!
598.005	So that's my incredible classroom, that's the food.
600.389	Where does it go? Zero miles to plate, right down into the cafeteria.
604.189	Or more importantly, to local shelters,
606.268	where most of our kids are getting one to two meals a day.
608.621	And we're stepping it up.
610.309	No Air Jordans were ever ruined on my farm.
612.871	And in his day, a million dollar gardens and incredible installations.
616.15	Let me tell you something, people.
617.79	This is a beautiful moment.
621.696	Black field, brown field, toxic waste field, battlefield --
624.881	we're proving in the Bronx that you can grow anywhere, on cement.
627.736	And we take orders for flowers. I'm putting the bake sale to shame.
631.657	We take orders now. I'm booking for the spring.
633.689	And these were all grown from seeds. We're learning everything.
637.057	And again, when you can take kids from backgrounds as diverse
639.953	as this to do something as special as this,
642.01	we're really creating a moment.
643.734	Now, you may ask about these kids.
646.45	Forty percent attendance to 93 percent attendance.
649.631	All start overage and under-credit.
652.52	They are now, my first cohort is all in college, earning a living wage.
656.456	The rest are scheduled to graduate this June.
658.737	Happy kids, happy families, happy colleagues.
661.689	Amazed people. The glory and bounty that is Bronx County.
665.825	Let's talk about mint. Where is my mint?
668.088	I grow seven kinds of mint in my class.
670.276	Mojitos, anybody? I'll be at Telepan later.
672.427	But, understand this is my intellectual Viagra.
675.622	Ladies and gentlemen, I gotta move quick, but understand this:
678.822	The borough that gave us baggy pants and funky fresh beats
681.558	is becoming home to the organic ones.
683.71	My green [unclear] 25,000 pounds of vegetables,
686.646	I'm growing organic citizens, engaged kids.
689.958	So help us go from this to this.
692.668	Self-sustaining entities, 18 months return on investment,
695.958	plus we're paying people living wage and health benefits,
698.15	while feeding people for pennies on the dollar.
700.006	Martin Luther King said that people need to be uplifted with dignity.
703.622	So here in New York, I urge you, my fellow Americans,
706.887	to help us make America great again.
709.534	It's simple. Share your passion.
711.478	It's real easy. Go see these two videos, please.
713.903	One got us invited to the White House, one's a recent incarnation.
716.802	And most importantly, get the biggest bully out of schools.
719.436	This has got to go tomorrow.
721.541	People, you can all do that.
723.602	Keep kids out of stores that look like this.
726.838	Make them a healthy plate,
728.535	especially if you can pick it off the wall in your own classroom -- delicioso!
731.286	Model good behavior. Get them to a green cart.
734.622	Big kids love strawberries and bananas.
736.838	Teach them entrepreneurship. Thank God for GrowNYC.
739.854	Let them cook. Great lunch today, let them do culinary things.
743.086	But most importantly, just love them.
745.005	Nothing works like unconditional love.
747.319	So, my good friend Kermit said it's not easy being green.
750.526	It's not. I come from a place where kids can buy
756.235	where ice cream freezers are filled with slushy malt liquor.
758.886	Okay? My dear friend Majora Carter once told me,
763.273	we have everything to gain and nothing to lose.
766.536	So here, and at a time when we've gone from
768.788	the audacity to hope to hope for some audacity,
771.343	I urge you to do something.
773.238	I urge you to do something.
774.709	Right now, we're all tadpoles,
776.453	but I urge you to become a big frog and take that big, green leap.
779.747	I don't care if you're on the left, on the right, up the middle, wherever.
783.041	Join me. Use -- I've got a lot of energy. Help me use it.
786.801	We can do something here.
789.435	And along the way, please take time to smell the flowers,
792.105	especially if you and your students grew them.
793.642	I'm Steve Ritz, this is Green Bronx Machine.
796.241	I've got to say thank you to my wife and family, for my kids,
799.61	thank you for coming every day, and for my colleagues,
801.368	believing and supporting me.
802.802	We are growing our way into a new economy.
804.935	Thank you, God bless you and enjoy the day. I'm Steve Ritz.
808.136	S√≠ se puede!
810.302	(Applause)
