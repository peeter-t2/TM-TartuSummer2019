13.34	I took a cell phone
15.38	and accidentally made myself famous.
19.06	(Laughter)
20.78	I was just talking
20.78	about the things that I cared about,
23.42	but with the click of a button
26.06	and an incendiary viral video
28.98	I propelled myself into overnight stardom.
32.42	When I say overnight,
33.98	I mean I literally woke up
33.98	the next morning
36.06	with so many notifications on my phone,
38.38	I thought I slept
38.38	through a national tragedy.
40.86	(Laughter)
45.42	It was the craziest thing, guys,
47.58	but when it came to my influence
47.58	and my exposure,
50.94	I literally took a quantum leap.
53.82	So I made more videos
55.9	and the subject matter of my videos
58.34	was often the most divisive subject
58.34	in American life,
62.7	but it was the way that I articulated race
65.26	that made me somewhat
65.26	of a digital lightning rod.
68.14	See, being a survivor myself
68.14	of police brutality
71.42	and having lost a childhood friend,
73.74	Alonzo Ashley,
75.34	at the hands of the police,
77.139	I had a little something
77.139	to say about the topic.
79.82	You see, this was at the height
79.82	of the Black Lives Matter furor
83.22	and people seemed to be turning
83.22	to me to articulate their viewpoints,
86.5	and honestly, it was sort of overwhelming.
89.5	You see, the internet
89.5	has this interesting quality.
92.18	In one way, it totally
92.18	brought the world together,
95.3	and I remember being a kid
96.98	and all of this utopian propaganda
96.98	was being dumped on us
101.18	about how the World Wide Web
103.02	was going to span the reaches
103.02	of people across the globe.
106.62	But as it turns out, people are people.
109.5	(Laughter)
111.14	And this magical superhighway
114.02	also took the demons of our nature
115.94	and gave them Ferraris.
117.58	(Laughter)
122.14	You see, technology, y'all,
122.14	is a lot like money.
125.86	It just brings out what's already
125.86	inside you and amplifies it.
129.46	And so I soon became familiar
129.46	with the phenomenon of the internet troll.
136.66	These guys seem to live
136.66	beneath the bridges
139.22	of said superhighway --
140.859	(Laughter)
144.62	And they also missed the memo about
144.62	the enlightenment of the internet age.
149.54	I remember being called
152.66	highly colorful racial slurs
155.5	by those who use
155.5	the anonymity of the internet
158.18	as a Klan hood.
160.38	And some of them
160.38	were pretty creative, actually,
163.22	but others were pretty wounding,
166.3	especially navigating
166.3	the post-traumatic world
169.1	of a police brutality survivor
171.62	in the height of Black Lives Matter,
173.78	with all of these people
173.78	being killed on my timeline.
177.78	To these trolls, I wasn't a human.
179.98	I was an idea, an object,
182.42	a caricature.
183.82	Did I mention that this race stuff
183.82	can be kind of divisive?
187.02	You see, I'm an innately curious person
189.9	and as I drew my sword to engage
189.9	in epic battles in the comment section --
194.82	(Laughter)
200.94	I also began to notice
204.14	that a few of my trolls
204.14	actually had brains,
207.62	which made me even more curious
207.62	and what to understand them even further.
211.54	And although these supposed morons
214.58	engaged in what appeared
214.58	to be original thought,
217.94	I said to myself,
219.82	"""Um, these guys are highly misinformed,"
222.54	"at least according to my knowledge."""
224.98	Where are these guys
224.98	getting these arguments from?
227.38	Like, was there some kind
227.38	of alternative universe
229.74	with alternative facts?
231.02	(Laughter)
234.02	(Applause)
241.34	Was history and gravity
241.34	optional over there?
244.66	I don't know.
247.7	But I needed to know.
247.7	Like, I wanted to know.
250.7	And as it turns out, I had no idea
250.7	about digital echo chambers.
256.1	That same target marketing algorithm
258.14	that feeds you more
258.14	of the products you like to buy
260.82	also feeds you more
260.82	of the news that you like to hear.
263.94	I had been living in an online universe
266.74	that just reflected
266.74	my worldview back to me.
269.339	So my timeline was pretty liberal.
271.18	I had no Breitbart
271.18	or Infowars or Fox News.
275.06	No, no, I was all MSNBC
275.06	and The Daily Show,
280.1	CNN and theGrio, right?
282.34	Well, these trolls were hopping
282.34	the dimensional doorway
286.22	and I needed to figure out how.
288.3	(Laughter)
294.54	So what I decided to do
297.14	was trick the Facebook algorithm
299.54	into feeding me more news
299.54	that I didn't necessarily agree with,
302.9	and this worked fine for a while,
302.9	but it wasn't enough,
305.74	because my online footprint
307.22	already established the patterns
307.22	that I like to hear.
310.14	So with the anonymity of the internet,
312.78	I went undercover.
314.02	(Laughter)
317.38	I set up this ghost profile
317.38	and went crazy.
322.18	Now, on a practical level,
322.18	it was very simple,
325.98	but on an emotional level,
325.98	it was kind of daunting,
328.78	especially with the racist vitriol
328.78	that I had experienced.
332.22	But what I didn't realize
332.22	is that my trolls were inoculating me,
336.7	thickening my skin,
338.34	making me immune to viewpoints
338.34	that I didn't necessarily agree with,
342.18	and so I didn't react to the same things
342.18	as I would have several months prior.
346.58	All right? So I pressed on.
349.26	Noticing that this stuff
349.26	also worked on YouTube,
352.14	I became Lucius25,
352.14	white supremacist lurker --
357.18	(Laughter)
364.58	And digitally I began to infiltrate
364.58	the infamous alt-right movement.
369.98	Now, my doppelg√§nger
371.86	was Edgar Rice Burroughs'
371.86	John Carter character --
375.54	(Laughter)
378.22	a sci-fi hero who was once
378.22	a Confederate soldier.
381.94	And to think, like, years ago,
381.94	I would have needed acting training
385.66	and, like, makeup and a fake ID.
388.58	Now I could just lurk.
390.98	And so I started
394.42	with a little Infowars,
396.42	went on into some American Renaissance,
398.9	National Vanguard Alliance,
401.18	and, you know, I started
401.18	commenting on videos,
404.06	talking bad about Al Sharpton
404.06	and Black Lives Matter.
407.34	I started bemoaning race baiters
407.34	like Eric Holder and Barack Obama
414.06	and just mirroring
414.06	the antiblack sentiments
416.82	that were thrown at me.
418.5	And to be honest,
418.5	it was kind of exhilarating.
421.26	(Laughter)
425.34	Like, I would literally spend days
425.34	clicking through my new racist profile --
429.58	(Laughter)
432.78	Goofing off at work in Aryan land.
432.78	It was something else.
437.02	(Laughter)
439.18	And so I then started
439.18	visiting some of the pages
443.58	of my former trolls,
445.54	and a lot of these guys
445.54	were just regular Joes,
449.34	a lot of outdoorsmen,
449.34	hunters, computer nerds,
453.14	some of them family guys
453.14	with videos of their families.
456.3	I mean, for all I know, some of y'all
456.3	could be in this room right now. Right?
459.944	(Laughter)
463.26	But when I went undercover,
463.26	I found a lovely plethora of characters,
468.38	luminaries like Milo Yiannopoulos,
468.38	Richard Spencer and David Duke.
474.42	All of these guys were
474.42	thought leaders in their own right,
477.78	but over time, the alt-right movement
477.78	ended up using their information
482.54	to fuel their momentum.
484.22	And I'm going to tell you what else
484.22	led to the momentum of the alt-right:
487.7	the left wing's wholesale demonization
487.7	of everything white and male.
493.46	If you are a pale-skinned penis-haver,
493.46	you're in league with Satan.
497.18	(Laughter)
504.94	Now, would you believe,
507.14	would you believe that some people
507.14	find that offensive?
511.22	And --
512.46	(Laughter)
513.62	And so, I mean, listen,
516.38	the fact is that millennials
516.38	get a lifetime of diet brand history.
521.86	I mean, America seems to be hellbent
521.86	on filling its textbooks
526.34	with CliffsNotes versions
526.34	of its dark past.
529.66	This severely, severely decontextualizes
529.66	race and the anger associated with it,
535.979	and that is fertile ground
535.979	for alt-facts to grow.
539.18	Add in the wild landscape of the internet
542.22	and it's easy to sell
542.22	"rebranded ""Mein Kampf"" ideas"
546.54	to a generation who has been
546.54	failed by public schools.
549.86	A lot of these ideas, easily debunked.
552.9	Alt-facts have that quality.
554.78	However, one theme kept screaming at me
554.78	through the subtext of those arguments,
560.14	and that was,
562.06	why should I be hated
562.06	for who I cannot help but be?
566.34	Now, as a black man in America,
566.34	that resonated with me.
569.18	I have spent so much time
571.22	defending myself
571.22	against attempts to demonize me
574.06	and make me apologize for who I am,
576.42	trying to portray me
576.42	as something that I'm not,
578.66	some kind of thug or gangster,
578.66	a menace to society.
581.82	Unexpected compassion.
584.38	Wow.
585.62	Now, listen,
587.18	the historical source of the demonization
587.18	of black males and white males
591.78	is highly different,
593.14	and where you fall on this argument,
595.66	sadly, tends to be an accident of birth.
598.98	Now, you're probably surprised
598.98	by this perspective,
603.26	and so was I.
605.02	Never in a billion years did I think
605.02	that I could have some kind of compassion
608.74	for people who hated my guts.
611.06	Now, mind you, not enough compassion
611.06	like I want to be friends.
614.06	I don't have infinite olive branches
614.06	to extend to people
617.26	who, like, would not want
617.26	to see me on this planet. Right?
621.06	But just enough compassion to understand
621.06	how they got to where they are.
625.86	And to be honest,
627.22	there were a couple of fair points.
629.3	One of them was how liberals
629.3	have this wide acceptance for everybody
634.82	except for those with honestly held
634.82	conservative viewpoints.
638.06	(Laughter)
640.7	Heaven forbid you love God,
640.7	this country and mean it. Right?
645.94	And another thing that they talked about
645.94	was this fear that they had
649.18	of something that they labeled
649.18	"as ""white genocide,"""
652.3	that diversity would be a force
652.3	that would wipe them out.
656.26	Now listen, I know what it is to fear
659.42	for the fate of your people.
661.06	Between crack, AIDS, gang violence,
664.02	mass incarceration,
664.02	gentrification, police shootings,
668.22	black people have more
668.22	than enough reasons to stay up at night.
671.74	But if nature is into diversity
671.74	and you are not,
674.66	you're going to lose that fight, buddy.
676.98	(Laughter)
679.82	(Applause)
686.94	You see, nature doesn't care
686.94	about your race. That's man-made.
690.26	Nature just cares about healthy organisms,
692.34	and your precious ethnic features
692.34	are expendable to that aim.
696.58	So the moment that you let go
696.58	of that racist identity
700.9	and relatch onto humanity,
702.74	all your problems go away.
704.3	(Applause)
711.86	I'm going to tell you
711.86	what race ain't about to die out:
714.9	the human race.
716.14	Join the party. The water's great.
719.521	Until the water gets too hot,
719.521	but that's another TED Talk.
722.26	(Laughter)
726.58	The point is that to get
726.58	to this point of understanding,
730.66	you have to let go of that fear
732.46	and embrace your curiosity,
734.18	and sadly, too many people
734.18	will not take that journey
737.66	to see the world from the other side.
740.7	And, I mean, let's be honest,
742.3	that doesn't just go for progressives,
744.46	but also to the right wing
744.46	and conservatives.
746.74	You know, as fair
746.74	as some of their points were,
748.98	they were still trapped
748.98	in their own echo chambers,
751.42	recycling old, outdated points of view,
753.82	never getting a diversity in perspective,
756.38	not making them well-rounded
756.38	in their worldview.
759.14	So they're not hearing
759.14	certain anti-racist and political voices,
763.98	voices like Tim Wise
765.98	and Michelle Alexander, Dr. Joy DeGruy,
765.98	Boyce Watkins, Tariq Nasheed.
771.46	All of these voices have the answers
771.46	to the questions that they want,
775.42	but unfortunately they will not hear them
775.42	due to the power of these echo chambers.
780.26	We have got to break out
780.26	of these digital divides,
783.94	because as our technology advances,
786.58	the consequences of our tribalism
786.58	become more dangerous.
790.1	And this whole experience
790.1	taught me something:
793.74	our gadgets ain't going to save us.
796.18	All these technological devices
799.18	are only mastery of the universe
799.18	out there, not the one in here.
803.9	And so that's all IQ, not EQ.
807.18	That's a dangerous imbalance.
809.02	Where do you get
809.02	the emotional intelligence,
811.86	the character development,
813.74	the virtues of patience,
813.74	forbearance, compassion,
816.46	you know, the things that make sure
816.46	that these devices, however advanced,
820.66	become a blessing and not a curse?
823.22	Seems to be me that humanity itself
823.22	needs an upgrade.
828.54	Now --
829.78	(Applause)
834.66	That's a big task, understandably,
837.34	but I don't believe
837.34	in any kind of unbeatable monster.
840.1	There was no giant out there
840.1	without perhaps a simple Achilles heel.
844.38	And what if I told you
845.74	that one of the best ways
845.74	to actually overcome this
849.54	is to have courageous conversations
852.78	with difficult people,
855.02	people who do not see the world
855.02	the same way that you see the world?
858.46	Oh yes, folks, conversations may be
858.46	indeed the key to that upgrade,
863.34	because remember,
864.9	language was the first form
864.9	of virtual reality.
867.94	It is literally a symbolic representation
867.94	of the physical world,
872.06	and through this device,
872.06	we change the physical world.
875.14	Keep in mind, conversations stop violence,
878.3	conversations start countries,
880.46	they build bridges,
881.74	and when the chips are down,
883.3	conversations are the last tools
883.3	that humans use
885.98	before they pick up their guns.
888.1	And I ain't talking
888.1	about online safe conversations
890.94	from the security of your laptop.
892.58	No.
894.02	I'm talking about in-your-face
894.02	conversations with real, breathing people.
898.74	And for me, this looks
898.74	like running a community forum
901.98	called Shop Talk Live.
903.9	Now, in Shop Talk Live --
903.9	somebody's been there, right?
907.46	In Shop Talk Live,
909.46	we have the conversations
909.46	that change lives.
911.94	We meet the community
911.94	right where they are,
914.74	and we've done everything
914.74	from divert gang violence in real time
919.18	to help find people jobs
920.86	to mentoring homeless youth.
923.02	And the reason why we needed to do this
924.94	is because there was a severe lack
924.94	of trust in the black community
929.06	due to the violence of the crack era.
932.26	And so we ended up taking
932.26	agency into our own hands,
935.54	solving our own problems,
937.1	not waiting for anybody else.
939.18	And the truth is,
940.42	from the mayor to the felon,
941.82	you're going to find them
941.82	in that barber shop.
944.02	And so what we did was just
944.02	organize what was already going on.
947.06	And so what I started doing
947.06	was mining these alternative viewpoints
950.82	from these alternative digital universes,
953.14	dissecting them, breaking them down
953.14	into controversial talking points.
957.7	Then, with my cell phone,
960.3	I flipped the internet against itself
962.38	and began to broadcast
962.38	these live conversations
965.14	to my online followers.
966.86	This made them want to leave
966.86	the safety of their laptops
969.9	and meet us in person
969.9	to have real conversations
972.26	with real people in real life.
974.54	And we did this. Thank you.
976.02	(Applause)
982.74	Sometimes I sit back,
982.74	and I reflect on the paradox
986.5	of me just trying to solve the problems,
988.74	us trying to solve the problems
988.74	in our own communities --
991.78	we build bridges
991.78	to so many other communities,
994.18	from the LGBTQ community
994.18	to the Arab immigrant community
997.82	and even sat down with somebody
997.82	with a Confederate flag on their hat
1001.78	and talked about the things
1001.78	that actually matter.
1004.5	It is time that we stop trying
1006.26	to hack our way
1006.26	around the human experience.
1009.62	There is no way out of each other.
1011.7	Stop trying to find one.
1014.06	(Applause)
1016.38	We have to understand something.
1020.1	Human beings all want the same things
1022.26	and we have to go through
1022.26	each other to get these things.
1024.98	These courageous conversations
1024.98	are the way that these bridges are built.
1028.66	It's time that we start
1028.66	seeing people as people
1031.22	and not simply the ideas
1031.22	that we project onto them or react to.
1035.18	Human beings are not the barriers
1037.899	but the gateways
1037.899	to the very things that we want.
1040.899	This is a collective
1040.899	and conscious evolution.
1044.38	My journey began with
1044.38	a terribly popular cell phone video
1049.54	and a fallen friend.
1051.26	Your journey begins right about now.
1054.74	Join the renaissance in human connection.
1057.26	It is going to happen with or without you.
1060.02	My suggestion: pick a topic,
1060.02	and start a community dialogue
1063.94	in your neck of the woods.
1065.78	Meet folks back in real life.
1067.58	And I'm going to tell you,
1069.14	when you trick the algorithm
1069.14	of your existence,
1071.54	you will get some diversified experiences.
1074.66	It is time to grow, people.
1076.5	And when we do this, not if,
1078.46	it will be clear
1078.46	that the key to this upgrade
1082.02	was always our inner world,
1082.02	not some device that we create,
1085.98	and the doorways
1085.98	to this experience is now,
1089.3	and will forever be, each other.
1092.1	Thank you.
