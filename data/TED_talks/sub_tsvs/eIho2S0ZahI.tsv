13.96	The human voice:
16.07	It's the instrument we all play.
18.61	It's the most powerful sound
18.61	in the world, probably.
21.093	It's the only one that can start a war
21.093	"or say ""I love you."""
23.94	And yet many people have the experience
25.822	that when they speak, people
25.822	don't listen to them.
28.21	And why is that?
29.346	How can we speak powerfully
29.346	to make change in the world?
33.485	What I'd like to suggest,
34.821	there are a number of habits
34.821	that we need to move away from.
37.69	I've assembled for your pleasure here
37.69	seven deadly sins of speaking.
41.444	I'm not pretending
41.444	this is an exhaustive list,
43.876	but these seven, I think, are pretty large
43.876	habits that we can all fall into.
49.132	First, gossip.
51.989	Speaking ill of somebody
51.989	who's not present.
54.7	Not a nice habit,
54.7	and we know perfectly well
56.82	the person gossiping, five minutes later,
56.82	will be gossiping about us.
61.771	Second, judging.
63.515	We know people who are like this
63.515	in conversation,
65.923	and it's very hard to listen to somebody
67.879	if you know that you're being judged
67.879	and found wanting at the same time.
72.029	Third, negativity.
74.447	You can fall into this.
75.759	My mother, in the last years of her life,
75.759	became very negative,
78.82	and it's hard to listen.
80.166	I remember one day, I said to her,
80.166	"""It's October 1 today,"""
82.923	"and she said, ""I know, isn't it dreadful?"""
85.04	(Laughter)
87.262	It's hard to listen
87.262	when somebody's that negative.
89.635	(Laughter)
90.931	And another form
90.931	of negativity, complaining.
93.475	Well, this is the national art of the U.K.
97.542	It's our national sport.
98.977	We complain about the weather, sport,
98.977	about politics, about everything,
102.435	but actually, complaining is viral misery.
104.555	It's not spreading sunshine
104.555	and lightness in the world.
108.292	Excuses.
110.048	We've all met this guy.
111.396	Maybe we've all been this guy.
112.996	Some people have a blamethrower.
115.49	They just pass it on to everybody else
117.718	and don't take responsibility
117.718	for their actions,
120.046	and again, hard to listen
120.046	to somebody who is being like that.
122.982	Penultimate, the sixth of the seven,
124.804	embroidery, exaggeration.
128.21	It demeans our language,
128.21	actually, sometimes.
130.638	For example, if I see something
130.638	that really is awesome,
133.93	what do I call it?
135.22	(Laughter)
137.84	And then, of course,
137.84	this exaggeration becomes lying,
141.3	and we don't want to listen
141.3	to people we know are lying to us.
144.323	And finally, dogmatism.
147.688	The confusion of facts with opinions.
151.323	When those two things get conflated,
153.262	you're listening into the wind.
154.763	You know, somebody is bombarding you
154.763	with their opinions as if they were true.
158.454	It's difficult to listen to that.
160.547	So here they are, seven deadly
160.547	sins of speaking.
163.588	These are things I think we need to avoid.
166.021	But is there a positive
166.021	way to think about this?
168.89	Yes, there is.
170.458	I'd like to suggest that there are four
170.458	really powerful cornerstones, foundations,
175.974	that we can stand on if we want our speech
178.42	to be powerful and to make
178.42	change in the world.
182.288	Fortunately, these things spell a word.
184.523	"The word is ""hail,"" and it has"
184.523	a great definition as well.
187.619	I'm not talking about the stuff
187.619	that falls from the sky
190.287	and hits you on the head.
191.575	I'm talking about this definition,
193.219	to greet or acclaim enthusiastically,
195.04	which is how I think
195.04	our words will be received
197.307	if we stand on these four things.
198.903	So what do they stand for?
200.425	See if you can guess.
202.32	The H, honesty, of course,
205.283	being true in what you say,
205.283	being straight and clear.
208.254	The A is authenticity,
208.254	just being yourself.
212.295	A friend of mine described it as
212.295	standing in your own truth,
215.505	which I think is a lovely way to put it.
217.443	The I is integrity, being your word,
220.079	actually doing what you say,
221.867	and being somebody people can trust.
224.358	And the L is love.
227.13	I don't mean romantic love,
229.251	but I do mean wishing people
229.251	well, for two reasons.
232.66	First of all, I think absolute honesty
232.66	may not be what we want.
236.074	I mean, my goodness,
236.074	you look ugly this morning.
238.663	Perhaps that's not necessary.
242.021	Tempered with love, of course,
242.021	honesty is a great thing.
245.379	But also, if you're really
245.379	wishing somebody well,
248.474	it's very hard to judge
248.474	them at the same time.
251.111	I'm not even sure you can do
251.111	those two things simultaneously.
255.31	So hail.
256.91	Also, now that's what you say,
258.667	and it's like the old song,
258.667	it is what you say,
260.935	it's also the way that you say it.
262.638	You have an amazing toolbox.
264.41	This instrument is incredible,
266.27	and yet this is a toolbox
266.27	that very few people have ever opened.
269.81	I'd like to have a little rummage
269.81	in there with you now
272.431	and just pull a few tools out
273.855	that you might like to take
273.855	away and play with,
276.118	which will increase
276.118	the power of your speaking.
278.442	Register, for example.
279.986	Now, falsetto register may not
279.986	be very useful most of the time,
284.18	but there's a register in between.
286.234	I'm not going to get very
286.234	technical about this
288.419	for any of you who are voice coaches.
290.205	You can locate your voice, however.
291.942	So if I talk up here in my nose,
291.942	you can hear the difference.
294.824	If I go down here in my throat,
296.332	which is where most of us
296.332	speak from most of the time.
298.985	But if you want weight,
300.642	you need to go down here to the chest.
303.12	You hear the difference?
304.73	We vote for politicians
304.73	with lower voices, it's true,
308.77	because we associate depth with power
311.738	and with authority.
314.445	That's register.
316.134	Then we have timbre.
317.501	It's the way your voice feels.
319.27	Again, the research shows
320.626	that we prefer voices
320.626	which are rich, smooth, warm,
324.424	like hot chocolate.
326.635	Well if that's not you,
326.635	that's not the end of the world,
329.923	because you can train.
331.365	Go and get a voice coach.
332.609	And there are amazing things you can do
334.491	with breathing, with posture,
334.491	and with exercises
336.921	to improve the timbre of your voice.
339.435	Then prosody. I love prosody.
341.227	This is the sing-song, the meta-language
343.403	that we use in order to impart meaning.
345.477	It's root one for meaning in conversation.
348.315	People who speak all on one note
348.315	are really quite hard to listen to
352.395	if they don't have any prosody at all.
354.611	That's where the word
354.611	"""monotonic"" comes from,"
357.586	or monotonous, monotone.
360.306	Also, we have repetitive
360.306	prosody now coming in,
363.603	where every sentence ends
363.603	as if it were a question
366.323	when it's actually not
366.323	a question, it's a statement?
368.824	(Laughter)
371.154	And if you repeat that one,
372.74	it's actually restricting your ability
372.74	to communicate through prosody,
376.108	which I think is a shame,
377.994	so let's try and break that habit.
381.315	Pace.
382.418	I can get very excited by saying
382.418	something really quickly,
385.203	or I can slow right down to emphasize,
388.579	and at the end of that, of course,
388.579	is our old friend silence.
394.555	There's nothing wrong with a bit
394.555	of silence in a talk, is there?
398.561	We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs.
401.833	It can be very powerful.
403.823	Of course, pitch often
403.823	goes along with pace
406.151	to indicate arousal, but you
406.151	can do it just with pitch.
408.795	Where did you leave my keys?
410.383	(Higher pitch) Where did you
410.383	leave my keys?
412.487	So, slightly different meaning
412.487	in those two deliveries.
416.156	And finally, volume.
418.402	(Loud) I can get really excited
418.402	by using volume.
421.803	Sorry about that, if I startled anybody.
423.98	Or, I can have you really pay attention
423.98	by getting very quiet.
428.707	Some people broadcast the whole time.
430.527	Try not to do that.
431.9	That's called sodcasting,
433.752	(Laughter)
435.445	Imposing your sound on people around you
435.445	carelessly and inconsiderately.
440.013	Not nice.
441.115	Of course, where this all comes
441.115	into play most of all
443.671	is when you've got something
443.671	really important to do.
446.199	It might be standing on a stage like this
446.199	and giving a talk to people.
449.651	It might be proposing marriage,
451.539	asking for a raise, a wedding speech.
454.693	Whatever it is, if it's really important,
456.699	you owe it to yourself
456.699	to look at this toolbox
460.472	and the engine that it's going to work on,
462.509	and no engine works well
462.509	without being warmed up.
465.604	Warm up your voice.
467.482	Actually, let me show you how to do that.
469.557	Would you all like to stand
469.557	up for a moment?
472.536	I'm going to show you
473.691	the six vocal warm-up exercises
473.691	that I do before every talk I ever do.
478.925	Any time you're going to talk
478.925	to anybody important, do these.
481.859	First, arms up, deep breath in,
484.662	and sigh out, ahhhhh, like that.
487.764	One more time.
489.392	Ahhhh, very good.
492.39	Now we're going to warm up our lips,
494.132	and we're going to go Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba,
496.484	Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba. Very good.
499.436	And now, brrrrrrrrrr,
502.876	just like when you were a kid.
504.426	Brrrr. Now your lips
504.426	should be coming alive.
506.853	We're going to do the tongue next
508.528	with exaggerated la, la, la,
508.528	la, la, la, la, la, la.
512.85	Beautiful. You're getting
512.85	really good at this.
515.065	And then, roll an R. Rrrrrrr.
517.955	That's like champagne for the tongue.
520.171	Finally, and if I can only do one,
522.491	the pros call this the siren.
524.298	It's really good. It starts
524.298	"with ""we"" and goes to ""aw."""
526.942	"The ""we"" is high, the ""aw"" is low."
528.586	So you go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww.
534.706	Fantastic. Give yourselves
534.706	a round of applause.
536.969	Take a seat, thank you.
538.238	(Applause)
539.712	Next time you speak, do those in advance.
542.336	Now let me just put this
542.336	in context to close.
544.976	This is a serious point here.
547.272	This is where we are now, right?
549.103	We speak not very well
550.768	to people who simply aren't listening
552.636	in an environment that's all
552.636	about noise and bad acoustics.
555.555	I have talked about that on this stage
555.555	in different phases.
558.798	What would the world be like
560.432	if we were speaking powerfully
562.152	to people who were listening consciously
564.208	in environments which were
564.208	actually fit for purpose?
567.602	Or to make that a bit larger,
570.585	what would the world be like
571.943	if we were creating sound consciously
574.31	and consuming sound consciously
576.343	and designing all our environments
578.07	consciously for sound?
579.547	That would be a world
579.547	that does sound beautiful,
582.671	and one where understanding
582.671	would be the norm,
586.582	and that is an idea worth spreading.
589.255	Thank you.
590.411	(Applause)
