14.966	I'm going to talk a little bit
14.966	about where technology's going.
19.509	And often technology comes to us,
22.566	we're surprised by what it brings.
24.455	But there's actually
24.455	a large aspect of technology
28.162	that's much more predictable,
29.988	and that's because technological systems
29.988	of all sorts have leanings,
34.1	they have urgencies,
35.299	they have tendencies.
36.884	And those tendencies are derived
36.884	from the very nature of the physics,
41.84	chemistry of wires
41.84	and switches and electrons,
45.659	and they will make reoccurring
45.659	patterns again and again.
49.745	And so those patterns produce
49.745	these tendencies, these leanings.
54.643	You can almost think of it
54.643	as sort of like gravity.
57.498	Imagine raindrops falling into a valley.
59.841	The actual path of a raindrop
59.841	as it goes down the valley
62.953	is unpredictable.
64.651	We cannot see where it's going,
66.193	but the general direction
66.193	is very inevitable:
68.494	it's downward.
70.377	And so these baked-in
70.377	tendencies and urgencies
74.973	in technological systems
77.051	give us a sense of where things
77.051	are going at the large form.
81.149	So in a large sense,
82.574	I would say that telephones
82.574	were inevitable,
87.005	but the iPhone was not.
89.094	The Internet was inevitable,
91.274	but Twitter was not.
93.036	So we have many ongoing
93.036	tendencies right now,
96.988	and I think one of the chief among them
99.732	is this tendency to make things
99.732	smarter and smarter.
104.041	I call it cognifying -- cognification --
106.783	also known as artificial
106.783	intelligence, or AI.
110.025	And I think that's going to be one
110.025	of the most influential developments
113.795	and trends and directions and drives
113.795	in our society in the next 20 years.
120.021	So, of course, it's already here.
122.03	We already have AI,
124.258	and often it works in the background,
126.68	in the back offices of hospitals,
128.29	where it's used to diagnose X-rays
128.29	better than a human doctor.
133	It's in legal offices,
134.75	where it's used to go
134.75	through legal evidence
137.142	better than a human paralawyer.
139.506	It's used to fly the plane
139.506	that you came here with.
144.165	Human pilots only flew it
144.165	seven to eight minutes,
146.57	the rest of the time the AI was driving.
148.547	And of course, in Netflix and Amazon,
150.744	it's in the background,
150.744	making those recommendations.
153.298	That's what we have today.
154.583	And we have an example, of course,
154.583	in a more front-facing aspect of it,
159.408	with the win of the AlphaGo, who beat
159.408	the world's greatest Go champion.
166.478	But it's more than that.
170.555	If you play a video game,
170.555	you're playing against an AI.
173.221	But recently, Google taught their AI
177.783	to actually learn how to play video games.
180.686	Again, teaching video games
180.686	was already done,
183.419	but learning how to play
183.419	a video game is another step.
187.34	That's artificial smartness.
190.571	What we're doing is taking
190.571	this artificial smartness
195.117	and we're making it smarter and smarter.
198.71	There are three aspects
198.71	to this general trend
202.629	that I think are underappreciated;
204.342	I think we would understand
204.342	AI a lot better
206.643	if we understood these three things.
208.968	I think these things also would
208.968	help us embrace AI,
212.275	because it's only by embracing it
212.275	that we actually can steer it.
215.887	We can actually steer the specifics
215.887	by embracing the larger trend.
219.467	So let me talk about
219.467	those three different aspects.
222.47	The first one is: our own intelligence
222.47	has a very poor understanding
226.167	of what intelligence is.
228.11	We tend to think of intelligence
228.11	as a single dimension,
231.787	that it's kind of like a note
231.787	that gets louder and louder.
234.561	It starts like with IQ measurement.
237.192	It starts with maybe a simple
237.192	low IQ in a rat or mouse,
241.308	and maybe there's more in a chimpanzee,
243.887	and then maybe there's more
243.887	in a stupid person,
246.102	and then maybe an average
246.102	person like myself,
248.222	and then maybe a genius.
249.536	And this single IQ intelligence
249.536	is getting greater and greater.
254.516	That's completely wrong.
255.691	That's not what intelligence is --
255.691	not what human intelligence is, anyway.
259.673	It's much more like a symphony
259.673	of different notes,
264.203	and each of these notes is played
264.203	on a different instrument of cognition.
267.836	There are many types
267.836	of intelligences in our own minds.
271.561	We have deductive reasoning,
274.633	we have emotional intelligence,
276.878	we have spatial intelligence;
278.295	we have maybe 100 different types
278.295	that are all grouped together,
282.34	and they vary in different strengths
282.34	with different people.
286.269	And of course, if we go to animals,
286.269	they also have another basket --
290.819	another symphony of different
290.819	kinds of intelligences,
293.384	and sometimes those same instruments
293.384	are the same that we have.
296.974	They can think in the same way,
296.974	but they may have a different arrangement,
300.559	and maybe they're higher
300.559	in some cases than humans,
303.05	like long-term memory in a squirrel
303.05	is actually phenomenal,
305.911	so it can remember
305.911	where it buried its nuts.
308.222	But in other cases they may be lower.
310.233	When we go to make machines,
312.987	we're going to engineer
312.987	them in the same way,
315.207	where we'll make some of those types
315.207	of smartness much greater than ours,
320.241	and many of them won't be
320.241	anywhere near ours,
322.836	because they're not needed.
324.404	So we're going to take these things,
326.631	these artificial clusters,
328.736	and we'll be adding more varieties
328.736	of artificial cognition to our AIs.
334.507	We're going to make them
334.507	very, very specific.
338.602	So your calculator is smarter
338.602	than you are in arithmetic already;
345.168	your GPS is smarter
345.168	than you are in spatial navigation;
349.337	Google, Bing, are smarter
349.337	than you are in long-term memory.
354.339	And we're going to take, again,
354.339	these kinds of different types of thinking
358.893	and we'll put them into, like, a car.
360.85	The reason why we want to put them
360.85	in a car so the car drives,
363.931	is because it's not driving like a human.
366.257	It's not thinking like us.
367.677	That's the whole feature of it.
369.621	It's not being distracted,
371.18	it's not worrying about whether
371.18	it left the stove on,
373.958	or whether it should have
373.958	majored in finance.
376.12	It's just driving.
377.297	(Laughter)
378.463	Just driving, OK?
380.328	And we actually might even
380.328	come to advertise these
383.289	"as ""consciousness-free."""
384.858	They're without consciousness,
386.656	they're not concerned about those things,
388.784	they're not distracted.
389.964	So in general, what we're trying to do
392.954	is make as many different
392.954	types of thinking as we can.
397.804	We're going to populate the space
399.911	of all the different possible types,
399.911	or species, of thinking.
404.094	And there actually may be some problems
406.186	that are so difficult
406.186	in business and science
409.01	that our own type of human thinking
409.01	may not be able to solve them alone.
413.076	We may need a two-step program,
415.092	which is to invent new kinds of thinking
419.692	that we can work alongside of to solve
419.692	these really large problems,
423.45	say, like dark energy or quantum gravity.
428.496	What we're doing
428.496	is making alien intelligences.
431.166	You might even think of this
431.166	as, sort of, artificial aliens
435.259	in some senses.
436.49	And they're going to help
436.49	us think different,
438.814	because thinking different
438.814	is the engine of creation
442.47	and wealth and new economy.
445.835	The second aspect of this
445.835	is that we are going to use AI
450.782	to basically make a second
450.782	Industrial Revolution.
454.135	The first Industrial Revolution
454.135	was based on the fact
456.932	that we invented something
456.932	I would call artificial power.
460.879	Previous to that,
462.053	during the Agricultural Revolution,
464.111	everything that was made
464.111	had to be made with human muscle
467.837	or animal power.
469.565	That was the only way
469.565	to get anything done.
471.652	The great innovation during
471.652	the Industrial Revolution was,
474.621	we harnessed steam power, fossil fuels,
477.754	to make this artificial power
477.754	that we could use
481.634	to do anything we wanted to do.
483.327	So today when you drive down the highway,
486.571	you are, with a flick of the switch,
486.571	commanding 250 horses --
492.716	which we can use to build skyscrapers,
492.716	to build cities, to build roads,
497.432	to make factories that would churn out
497.432	lines of chairs or refrigerators
503.245	way beyond our own power.
504.923	And that artificial power can also
504.923	be distributed on wires on a grid
511.058	to every home, factory, farmstead,
514.281	and anybody could buy
514.281	that artificial power,
518.496	just by plugging something in.
519.992	So this was a source
519.992	of innovation as well,
522.455	because a farmer could take
522.455	a manual hand pump,
525.897	and they could add this artificial
525.897	power, this electricity,
528.837	and he'd have an electric pump.
530.358	And you multiply that by thousands
530.358	or tens of thousands of times,
533.7	and that formula was what brought us
533.7	the Industrial Revolution.
536.883	All the things that we see,
536.883	all this progress that we now enjoy,
540.492	has come from the fact
540.492	that we've done that.
542.579	We're going to do
542.579	the same thing now with AI.
544.951	We're going to distribute that on a grid,
547.05	and now you can take that electric pump.
549.448	You can add some artificial intelligence,
552.44	and now you have a smart pump.
553.945	And that, multiplied by a million times,
555.897	is going to be this second
555.897	Industrial Revolution.
558.284	So now the car is going down the highway,
560.69	it's 250 horsepower,
560.69	but in addition, it's 250 minds.
565.008	That's the auto-driven car.
566.801	It's like a new commodity;
568.214	it's a new utility.
569.541	The AI is going to flow
569.541	across the grid -- the cloud --
572.606	in the same way electricity did.
574.197	So everything that we had electrified,
576.601	we're now going to cognify.
578.693	And I would suggest, then,
580.102	that the formula
580.102	for the next 10,000 start-ups
583.858	is very, very simple,
585.044	which is to take x and add AI.
589.1	That is the formula,
589.1	that's what we're going to be doing.
591.936	And that is the way
591.936	in which we're going to make
595.266	this second Industrial Revolution.
597.148	And by the way -- right now, this minute,
599.326	you can log on to Google
600.519	and you can purchase
600.519	AI for six cents, 100 hits.
604.758	That's available right now.
606.386	So the third aspect of this
609.315	is that when we take this AI
609.315	and embody it,
612.017	we get robots.
613.214	And robots are going to be bots,
614.941	they're going to be doing many
614.941	of the tasks that we have already done.
620.357	A job is just a bunch of tasks,
621.909	so they're going to redefine our jobs
623.695	because they're going to do
623.695	some of those tasks.
625.978	But they're also going to create
625.978	whole new categories,
629.199	a whole new slew of tasks
631.47	that we didn't know
631.47	we wanted to do before.
633.951	They're going to actually
633.951	engender new kinds of jobs,
637.612	new kinds of tasks that we want done,
639.907	just as automation made up
639.907	a whole bunch of new things
643.336	that we didn't know we needed before,
645.194	and now we can't live without them.
647.174	So they're going to produce
647.174	even more jobs than they take away,
651.154	but it's important that a lot of the tasks
651.154	that we're going to give them
654.612	are tasks that can be defined
654.612	in terms of efficiency or productivity.
659.676	If you can specify a task,
661.528	either manual or conceptual,
663.787	that can be specified in terms
663.787	of efficiency or productivity,
668.591	that goes to the bots.
670.758	Productivity is for robots.
672.96	What we're really good at
672.96	is basically wasting time.
676.054	(Laughter)
677.106	We're really good at things
677.106	that are inefficient.
679.446	Science is inherently inefficient.
682.816	It runs on that fact that you have
682.816	one failure after another.
685.746	It runs on the fact that you make tests
685.746	and experiments that don't work,
689.194	otherwise you're not learning.
690.66	It runs on the fact
691.846	that there is not
691.846	a lot of efficiency in it.
693.953	Innovation by definition is inefficient,
696.756	because you make prototypes,
698.171	because you try stuff that fails,
698.171	that doesn't work.
700.902	Exploration is inherently inefficiency.
704.038	Art is not efficient.
705.593	Human relationships are not efficient.
707.744	These are all the kinds of things
707.744	we're going to gravitate to,
710.708	because they're not efficient.
712.207	Efficiency is for robots.
715.338	We're also going to learn
715.338	that we're going to work with these AIs
719.485	because they think differently than us.
722.005	When Deep Blue beat
722.005	the world's best chess champion,
726.343	people thought it was the end of chess.
728.296	But actually, it turns out that today,
728.296	the best chess champion in the world
732.722	is not an AI.
734.906	And it's not a human.
736.111	It's the team of a human and an AI.
738.85	The best medical diagnostician
738.85	is not a doctor, it's not an AI,
742.874	it's the team.
744.074	We're going to be working with these AIs,
746.247	and I think you'll be paid in the future
748.266	by how well you work with these bots.
751.026	So that's the third thing,
751.026	is that they're different,
755.307	they're utility
756.496	and they are going to be something
756.496	we work with rather than against.
760.336	We're working with these
760.336	rather than against them.
762.999	So, the future:
764.5	Where does that take us?
765.944	I think that 25 years from now,
765.944	they'll look back
769.535	and look at our understanding
769.535	of AI and say,
772.684	"""You didn't have AI. In fact,"
772.684	you didn't even have the Internet yet,
776.008	compared to what we're going
776.008	"to have 25 years from now."""
779.849	There are no AI experts right now.
782.92	There's a lot of money going to it,
784.643	there are billions of dollars
784.643	being spent on it;
786.935	it's a huge business,
789.123	but there are no experts, compared
789.123	to what we'll know 20 years from now.
794.064	So we are just at the beginning
794.064	of the beginning,
796.973	we're in the first hour of all this.
799.16	We're in the first hour of the Internet.
801.119	We're in the first hour of what's coming.
803.183	The most popular AI product
803.183	in 20 years from now,
807.36	that everybody uses,
809.499	has not been invented yet.
812.464	That means that you're not late.
815.684	Thank you.
816.859	(Laughter)
817.909	(Applause)
