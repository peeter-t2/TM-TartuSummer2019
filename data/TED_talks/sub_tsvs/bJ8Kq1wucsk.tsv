12.904	I want you to, for a moment,
15.452	think about playing a game of Monopoly.
19.087	Except in this game,
19.087	that combination of skill, talent and luck
24.532	that helped earn you success
24.532	in games, as in life,
27.311	has been rendered irrelevant,
28.736	because this game's been rigged,
30.916	and you've got the upper hand.
32.795	You've got more money,
34.603	more opportunities to move
34.603	around the board,
37.164	and more access to resources.
39.398	And as you think about that experience,
41.292	I want you to ask yourself:
43.105	How might that experience of being
43.105	a privileged player in a rigged game
48.176	change the way you think about yourself
51.168	and regard that other player?
54.914	So, we ran a study
54.914	on the UC Berkeley campus
58.019	to look at exactly that question.
60.283	We brought in more than 100 pairs
60.283	of strangers into the lab,
64.857	and with the flip of a coin,
66.595	randomly assigned one of the two
66.595	to be a rich player in a rigged game.
70.66	They got two times as much money;
73.509	when they passed Go,
73.509	they collected twice the salary;
77.339	and they got to roll
77.339	both dice instead of one,
79.644	so they got to move
79.644	around the board a lot more.
81.962	(Laughter)
84.018	And over the course of 15 minutes,
85.75	we watched through
85.75	hidden cameras what happened.
89.257	What I want to do today,
89.257	for the first time,
91.377	is show you a little bit of what we saw.
93.549	You'll to have to pardon
93.549	the sound quality,
95.874	because again, these were hidden cameras.
97.871	So we've provided subtitles.
99.951	[Video] Rich Player: How many
102.29	Poor Player: Just one.
103.465	RP: Are you serious?
103.465	PP: Yeah.
104.909	RP: I have three. (Laughs)
104.909	I don't know why they gave me so much.
108.064	Paul Piff: So it was quickly apparent
108.064	to players that something was up.
111.453	One person clearly has
111.453	a lot more money than the other person,
114.604	and yet, as the game unfolded,
117.184	we saw very notable differences,
117.184	dramatic differences begin to emerge
121.738	between the two players.
123.488	The rich player started to move
123.488	around the board louder,
127.831	literally smacking the board
127.831	with the piece as he went around.
130.879	(Game piece smacks board)
132.61	We were more likely
132.61	to see signs of dominance
135.583	and nonverbal signs, displays of power
139.62	and celebration among the rich players.
143.5	We had a bowl of pretzels
143.5	positioned off to the side.
146.209	It's on the bottom right corner.
147.775	That allowed us to watch
147.775	participants' consummatory behavior.
151.258	So we're just tracking
151.258	how many pretzels participants eat.
155.782	[Video] RP: Are those pretzels a trick?
157.753	PP: I don't know.
159.713	Paul Piff: OK, so no surprises,
159.713	people are on to us.
162.852	They wonder what that bowl of pretzels
162.852	is doing there in the first place.
166.368	One even asks, like you just saw,
168.026	"""Is that bowl of pretzels"
168.026	"there as a trick?"""
171.035	And yet, despite that,
171.035	the power of the situation
174.103	seems to inevitably dominate,
176.337	and those rich players
176.337	start to eat more pretzels.
179.396	(Laughter)
184.29	[Video] RP: I love pretzels.
185.726	(Laughter)
190.314	Paul Piff: And as the game went on,
192.448	one of the really interesting
192.448	and dramatic patterns
194.947	that we observed begin to emerge
198.254	was that the rich players
198.254	actually started to become ruder
201.08	toward the other person --
203.103	less and less sensitive to the plight
203.103	of those poor, poor players,
206.729	and more and more demonstrative
206.729	of their material success,
211.288	more likely to showcase
211.288	how well they're doing.
216.084	[Video] RP: I have money ...
217.741	(Laughs) I have money for everything.
220.013	PP: How much is that?
221.51	RP: You owe me 24 dollars.
225.404	You're going to lose all your money soon.
228.135	I'll buy it. I have so much money.
230.295	I have so much money, it takes me forever.
232.345	RP 2: I'm going
232.345	to buy out this whole board.
234.458	RP 3: You're going
234.458	to run out of money soon.
236.563	I'm pretty much untouchable at this point.
238.635	(Laughter)
240.247	Paul Piff: And here's what I think
240.247	was really, really interesting:
243.456	it's that, at the end of the 15 minutes,
246.298	we asked the players to talk
246.298	about their experience during the game.
250.647	And when the rich players talked
250.647	about why they had inevitably won
254.757	in this rigged game of Monopoly ...
256.453	(Laughter)
261.468	They talked about what they'd done
261.468	to buy those different properties
267.84	and earn their success in the game.
269.829	(Laughter)
270.887	And they became far less attuned
273.311	to all those different
273.311	features of the situation --
275.847	including that flip of a coin --
278.503	that had randomly gotten them
278.503	into that privileged position
282.526	in the first place.
283.853	And that's a really,
283.853	really incredible insight
286.71	into how the mind
286.71	makes sense of advantage.
292.101	Now, this game of Monopoly can be used
294.303	as a metaphor for understanding society
294.303	and its hierarchical structure,
299.286	wherein some people
299.286	have a lot of wealth and a lot of status,
302.927	and a lot of people don't;
304.435	they have a lot less wealth
304.435	and a lot less status
307.348	and a lot less access to valued resources.
310.42	And what my colleagues and I
310.42	for the last seven years have been doing
313.826	is studying the effects
313.826	of these kinds of hierarchies.
317.706	What we've been finding
317.706	across dozens of studies
321.109	and thousands of participants
321.109	across this country
324.485	is that as a person's levels
324.485	of wealth increase,
329.088	their feelings of compassion
329.088	and empathy go down,
335.038	and their feelings of entitlement,
335.038	of deservingness,
338.788	and their ideology
338.788	of self-interest increase.
343.284	In surveys, we've found
344.901	that it's actually wealthier individuals
344.901	who are more likely to moralize
348.788	greed being good,
350.519	and that the pursuit of self-interest
350.519	is favorable and moral.
355.063	Now, what I want to do today
355.063	is talk about some of the implications
358.717	of this ideology self-interest,
361.668	talk about why we should
361.668	care about those implications,
364.336	and end with what might be done.
367.565	Some of the first studies
367.565	that we ran in this area
370.006	looked at helping behavior,
371.366	something social psychologists
371.366	"call ""pro-social behavior."""
375.453	And we were really interested
376.926	in who's more likely
376.926	to offer help to another person:
380.444	someone who's rich or someone who's poor.
383.555	In one of the studies,
384.847	we bring rich and poor members
384.847	of the community into the lab,
390.389	and give each of them
390.389	the equivalent of 10 dollars.
393.785	We told the participants they could keep
393.785	these 10 dollars for themselves,
398.021	or they could share
398.021	a portion of it, if they wanted to,
400.933	with a stranger, who's totally anonymous.
403.301	They'll never meet that stranger;
403.301	the stranger will never meet them.
406.582	And we just monitor how much people give.
409.554	Individuals who made 25,000,
409.554	sometimes under 15,000 dollars a year,
414.227	gave 44 percent more
414.227	of their money to the stranger
417.568	than did individuals making
422.983	We've had people play games
425.809	to see who's more or less likely to cheat
428.499	to increase their chances
428.499	of winning a prize.
430.877	In one of the games,
430.877	we actually rigged a computer
433.65	so that die rolls over a certain score
433.65	were impossible --
437.354	You couldn't get above 12
437.354	in this game, and yet ...
442.564	the richer you were, the more likely
442.564	you were to cheat in this game
445.777	to earn credits toward a $50 cash prize --
449.146	sometimes by three to four times as much.
453.106	We ran another study
454.294	where we looked at whether people
454.294	would be inclined to take candy
458.474	from a jar of candy
458.474	that we explicitly identified
461.138	as being reserved for children --
463.042	(Laughter)
466.662	I'm not kidding -- I know it sounds
466.662	like I'm making a joke.
471.221	We explicitly told participants:
473.475	"""This candy is for children participating"
473.475	in a developmental lab nearby.
477.832	"They're in studies. This is for them."""
479.985	And we just monitored
479.985	how much candy participants took.
483.567	Participants who felt rich
483.567	took two times as much candy
486.506	as participants who felt poor.
489.675	We've even studied cars.
492.315	Not just any cars,
494.008	but whether drivers
494.008	of different kinds of cars
497.296	are more or less inclined
497.296	to break the law.
500.338	In one of these studies,
502.558	we looked at whether drivers
502.558	would stop for a pedestrian
507.309	that we had posed waiting
507.309	to cross at a crosswalk.
510.193	Now in California, as you all know,
512.065	because I'm sure we all do this,
514.493	it's the law to stop for a pedestrian
514.493	who's waiting to cross.
518.434	So here's an example of how we did it.
520.3	That's our confederate off to the left,
520.3	posing as a pedestrian.
523.867	He approaches as the red truck
523.867	successfully stops.
528.219	In typical California fashion,
530.022	it's overtaken by the bus
530.022	who almost runs our pedestrian over.
533.015	(Laughter)
534.392	Now here's an example
534.392	of a more expensive car,
536.621	a Prius, driving through,
536.621	and a BMW doing the same.
543.59	So we did this for hundreds of vehicles
546.029	on several days,
548.512	just tracking who stops and who doesn't.
552.587	What we found was as the expensiveness
552.587	of a car increased ...
556.864	(Laughter)
558.96	the drivers' tendencies
558.96	to break the law increased as well.
562.215	None of the cars -- none of the cars --
565.04	in our least expensive car category
568.135	broke the law.
569.793	Close to 50 percent of the cars
569.793	in our most expensive vehicle category
574.66	broke the law.
577.55	We've run other studies,
578.822	finding that wealthier individuals
578.822	are more likely to lie in negotiations,
582.733	to endorse unethical behavior at work,
584.948	like stealing cash from the cash register,
587.662	taking bribes, lying to customers.
592.697	Now, I don't mean to suggest
594.314	that it's only wealthy people
594.314	who show these patterns of behavior.
597.912	Not at all -- in fact,
597.912	I think that we all,
600.742	in our day-to-day, minute-by-minute lives,
603.685	struggle with these competing motivations
606.558	of when or if to put our own interests
606.558	above the interests of other people.
612.273	And that's understandable,
614.573	because the American dream is an idea
617.494	in which we all have an equal opportunity
617.494	to succeed and prosper,
622.353	as long as we apply
622.353	ourselves and work hard.
624.933	And a piece of that means that sometimes,
627.666	you need to put your own interests
630.619	above the interests and well-being
630.619	of other people around you.
634.152	But what we're finding
634.152	is that the wealthier you are,
637.547	the more likely you are to pursue
637.547	a vision of personal success,
641.411	of achievement and accomplishment,
643.76	to the detriment of others around you.
646.927	Here I've plotted for you
646.927	the mean household income
650.224	received by each fifth
650.224	and top five percent of the population
653.484	over the last 20 years.
655.579	In 1993,
656.837	the differences between the different
656.837	quintiles of the population,
659.987	in terms of income,
661.199	are fairly egregious.
663.732	It's not difficult to discern
663.732	that there are differences.
666.446	But over the last 20 years,
666.446	that significant difference
669.299	has become a Grand Canyon of sorts
671.615	between those at the top
671.615	and everyone else.
674.663	In fact, the top 20 percent
674.663	of our population
678.321	own close to 90 percent
678.321	of the total wealth in this country.
681.444	We're at unprecedented levels
681.444	of economic inequality.
687.858	What that means is that wealth is not only
687.858	becoming increasingly concentrated
691.723	in the hands of a select group
691.723	of individuals,
694.681	but the American dream
694.681	is becoming increasingly unattainable
699.033	for an increasing majority of us.
702.227	And if it's the case,
702.227	as we've been finding,
705.05	that the wealthier you are,
706.523	the more entitled you feel to that wealth,
709.066	and the more likely you are
709.066	to prioritize your own interests
712.088	above the interests of other people,
713.868	and be willing to do things
713.868	to serve that self-interest,
717.417	well, then, there's no reason to think
717.417	that those patterns will change.
721.108	In fact, there's every reason
721.108	to think that they'll only get worse,
724.664	and that's what it would look like
724.664	if things just stayed the same,
727.874	at the same linear rate,
727.874	over the next 20 years.
732.162	Now inequality -- economic inequality --
734.926	is something we should
734.926	all be concerned about,
737.149	and not just because of those
737.149	at the bottom of the social hierarchy,
740.776	but because individuals and groups
743.144	with lots of economic
743.144	inequality do worse ...
748.349	not just the people
748.349	at the bottom, everyone.
751.206	There's a lot of really
751.206	compelling research
753.297	coming out from top labs
753.297	all over the world,
755.981	showcasing the range of things
755.981	that are undermined
760.655	as economic inequality gets worse.
763.195	Social mobility,
763.195	things we really care about,
766.048	physical health, social trust,
768.53	all go down as inequality goes up.
771.486	Similarly, negative things
771.486	in social collectives and societies,
776.035	things like obesity, and violence,
778.139	imprisonment, and punishment,
779.761	are exacerbated as economic
779.761	inequality increases.
783.911	Again, these are outcomes
783.911	not just experienced by a few,
787.478	but that resound
787.478	across all strata of society.
790.94	Even people at the top
790.94	experience these outcomes.
794.219	So what do we do?
797.307	This cascade of self-perpetuating,
800.913	pernicious, negative effects
803.422	could seem like something
803.422	that's spun out of control,
806.842	and there's nothing we can do about it,
808.754	certainly nothing
808.754	we as individuals could do.
811.558	But in fact, we've been finding
811.558	in our own laboratory research
818.52	that small psychological interventions,
823.695	small changes to people's values,
826.831	small nudges in certain directions,
830.212	can restore levels
830.212	of egalitarianism and empathy.
833.759	For instance, reminding people
833.759	of the benefits of cooperation
838.056	or the advantages of community,
840.961	cause wealthier individuals
840.961	to be just as egalitarian
844.797	as poor people.
847.369	In one study, we had people watch
847.369	a brief video, just 46 seconds long,
852.918	about childhood poverty
855.144	that served as a reminder of the needs
855.144	of others in the world around them.
860.257	And after watching that,
862.176	we looked at how willing people
862.176	were to offer up their own time
866.242	to a stranger presented to them
866.242	in the lab, who was in distress.
871.026	After watching this video, an hour later,
874.27	rich people became
874.27	just as generous of their own time
877.674	to help out this other person, a stranger,
879.844	as someone who's poor,
881.313	suggesting that these differences
881.313	are not innate or categorical,
885.595	but are so malleable
885.595	to slight changes in people's values,
889.375	and little nudges of compassion
889.375	and bumps of empathy.
893.172	And beyond the walls of our lab,
894.773	we're even beginning to see
894.773	signs of change in society.
898.893	Bill Gates, one of our nation's
898.893	wealthiest individuals,
902.065	in his Harvard commencement speech,
904.017	talked about the problem
904.017	of inequality facing society
906.902	as being the most daunting challenge,
909.589	and talked about what must
909.589	be done to combat it,
912.447	"saying, ""Humanity's greatest advances"
912.447	are not in its discoveries --
917.489	but in how those discoveries are applied
920.545	"to reduce inequity."""
923.356	And there's the Giving Pledge,
925.309	in which more than 100
925.309	of our nation's wealthiest individuals
930.077	are pledging half
930.077	of their fortunes to charity.
933.886	And there's the emergence of dozens
933.886	of grassroots movements,
939.136	"like ""We are the 1 percent,"""
941.508	"""Resource Generation,"""
943.556	"or ""Wealth for Common Good,"""
945.469	in which the most privileged
945.469	members of the population,
949.832	members of the one percent and elsewhere,
952.8	people who are wealthy,
954.662	are using their own economic resources,
958.139	adults and youth alike --
958.139	that's what's most striking to me --
962.396	leveraging their own privilege,
962.396	their own economic resources,
965.981	to combat inequality
968.846	by advocating for social policies,
971.866	changes in social values
973.748	and changes in people's behavior
976.143	that work against
