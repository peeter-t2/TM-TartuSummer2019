15.579	This is about a hidden corner of the labor market.
19.162	It's the world of people who need to work ultra-flexibly,
22.795	if they're to work at all.
24.112	So think, for instance,
25.279	of someone who has a recurring but unpredictable medical condition,
28.897	or somebody who's caring for a dependent adult,
31.68	or a parent with complex child care needs.
34.527	Their availability for work can be such that it's,
37.685	"""A few hours today."
39.378	"Maybe I can work tomorrow, but I don't know if and when yet."""
42.978	And it's extraordinarily difficult for these people
45.497	to find the work that they so often need very badly.
48.526	Which is a tragedy because there are employers
51.345	who can use pools of very flexible local people
54.651	booked completely ad hoc around when that person wants to work.
58.55	Imagine that you run a cafe.
61.151	It's mid-morning, the place is filling up.
62.818	You're going to have a busy lunchtime rush.
64.401	If you could get two extra workers for 90 minutes
67.718	to start in an hour's time,
70.372	you'd do it, but they'd have to be reliable, inducted in how your cafe works.
75.33	They'd have to be available at very competitive rates.
77.206	They'd have to be bookable in about the next minute.
80.373	In reality, no recruitment agency wants to handle that sort of business,
84.305	so you are going to muddle by, understaffed.
87.688	And it's not just caterers, it's hoteliers, it's retailers,
90.006	it's anyone who provides services to the public or businesses.
93.305	There's all sorts of organizations that can use these pools of very flexible people,
97.838	possibly already once they've been inducted.
100.989	At this level of the labor market,
103.022	what you need is a marketplace for spare hours.
106.872	They do exist. Here's how they work.
108.989	So in this example, a distribution company has said,
112.456	we've got a rush order that we've got to get out of the warehouse tomorrow morning.
115.739	Show us everyone who's available.
117.139	It's found 31 workers.
118.79	Everybody on this screen is genuinely available at those specific hours tomorrow.
122.322	They're all contactable in time for this booking.
124.656	They've all defined the terms on which they will accept bookings.
128.657	And this booking is within all the parameters for each individual.
132.071	And they would all be legally compliant by doing this booking.
134.632	Of course, they're all trained to work in warehouses.
136.556	You can select as many of them as you want.
138.771	They're from multiple agencies.
140.223	It's calculated the charge rate for each person for this specific booking.
144.155	And it's monitoring their reliability.
146.489	The people on the top row are the provenly reliable ones.
149.489	They're likely to be more expensive.
151.238	In an alternative view of this pool of local, very flexible people,
154.439	here's a market research company,
156.122	and it's inducted maybe 25 local people in how to do street interviewing.
160.072	And they've got a new campaign. They want to run it next week.
162.757	And they're looking at how many of the people they've inducted
166.156	are available each hour next week.
168.438	And they'll then decide when to do their street interviews.
171.172	But is there more that could be done
173.789	for this corner of the labor market?
175.539	Because right now there are so many people
178.225	who need whatever economic opportunity they can get.
181.823	Let's make it personal.
183.873	Imagine that a young woman -- base of the economic pyramid,
186.656	very little prospect of getting a job --
188.856	what economic activity could she theoretically engage in?
192.572	Well, she might be willing to work odd hours
194.856	in a call center, in a reception area, in a mail room.
198.156	She may be interested in providing local services to her community:
201.488	babysitting, local deliveries, pet care.
204.039	She may have possessions that she would like to trade
207.176	at times she doesn't need them.
208.422	So she might have a sofa bed in her front room that she would like to let out.
212.021	She might have a bike, a video games console she only uses occasionally.
216.189	And you're probably thinking -- because you're all very web-aware --
219.59	yes, and we're in the era of collaborative consumption,
222.155	so she can go online and do all this.
223.915	She can go to Airbnb to list her sofa bed,
226.573	"she can go to TaskRabbit.com and say, ""I want to do local deliveries,"" and so on."
230.457	These are good sites, but I believe we can go a step further.
235.807	And the key to that is a philosophy that we call modern markets for all.
242.421	Markets have changed beyond recognition in the last 20 years,
246.972	but only for organizations at the top of the economy.
250.656	If you're a Wall Street trader, you now take it for granted
253.656	that you sell your financial assets in a system of markets
256.572	that identifies the most profitable opportunities for you in real time,
260.155	executes on that in microseconds within the boundaries you've set.
263.808	It analyzes supply and demand and pricing
267.24	and tells you where your next wave of opportunities are coming from.
269.333	It manages counterparty risk in incredibly sophisticated ways.
272.883	It's all extremely low overhead.
275.317	What have we gained at the bottom of the economy
278.318	in terms of markets in the last 20 years?
282.412	Basically classified adverts with a search facility.
288.571	So why do we have this disparity
290.584	between these incredibly sophisticated markets at the top of the economy
294.134	that are increasingly sucking more and more activity and resource
297.75	out of the main economy into this rarefied level of trading,
301.199	and what the rest of us have?
303.583	A modern market is more than a website;
306.649	it's a web of interoperable marketplaces,
309.268	back office mechanisms, regulatory regimes,
311.802	settlement mechanisms, liquidity sources and so on.
316.699	And when a Wall Street trader comes into work in the morning,
319.85	she does not write a listing for every financial derivative she wants to sell today
325.049	and then post that listing on multiple websites
327.665	and wait for potential buyers to get in touch
330.165	and start negotiating the terms on which she might trade.
333.882	In the early days of this modern markets technology,
336.781	the financial institutions worked out
338.849	how they could leverage their buying power, their back office processes,
342.481	their relationships, their networks
344.781	to shape these new markets that would create all this new activity.
349.371	They asked governments for supporting regulatory regimes,
352.46	and in a lot of cases they got it.
355.094	But throughout the economy,
357.044	there are facilities that could likewise leverage
359.862	a new generation of markets
361.461	for the benefit of all of us.
364.194	And those facilities --
366.162	I'm talking about things like the mechanisms that prove our identity,
369.878	the licensing authorities
372.161	that know what each of us is allowed to do legally at any given time,
375.994	the processes by which we resolve disputes through official channels.
379.662	These mechanisms, these facilities
382.511	are not in the gift of Craigslist or Gumtree or Yahoo,
386.06	they're controlled by the state.
389.162	And the policymakers who sit on top of them
391.893	are, I suggest, simply not thinking about how those facilities could be used
398.111	to underpin a whole new era of markets.
400.894	Like everyone else, those policymakers are taking it for granted
405.611	that modern markets are the preserve
407.879	of organizations powerful enough to create them for themselves.
415.79	Suppose we stopped taking that for granted.
419.217	Suppose tomorrow morning the prime minister of Britain or the president of the U.S.,
422.383	or the leader of any other developed nation,
424.565	"woke up and said, ""I'm never going to be able to create"
428.416	all the jobs I need in the current climate.
430.582	I have got to focus on whatever economic opportunity I can get to my citizens.
435.916	And for that they have to be able to access state-of-the-art markets.
439.883	"How do I make that happen?"""
442.251	And I think I can see a few eyes rolling.
445	Politicians in a big, complex, sophisticated I.T. project?
448.782	Oh, that's going to be a disaster waiting to happen.
452.312	Not necessarily.
455.317	There is a precedent for technology-enabled service
458.165	that has been initiated by politicians in multiple countries
461.867	and has been hugely successful:
464.683	national lotteries.
467.133	Let's take Britain as an example.
468.883	Our government didn't design the national lottery,
471.483	it didn't fund the national lottery, it doesn't operate the national lottery.
474.266	It simply passed the National Lottery Act and this is what followed.
479.417	This act defines what a national lottery will look like.
482.682	It specifies certain benefits
484.35	that the state can uniquely bestow on the operators.
487.033	And it puts some obligations on those operators.
489.732	In terms of spreading gambling activity to the masses,
493.082	this was an unqualified success.
496.116	But let's suppose that our aim
497.9	is to bring new economic activity to the base of the pyramid.
501.783	Could we use the same model?
503.933	I believe we could.
505.717	So imagine that policymakers outlined a facility.
509.833	Let's call it national e-markets, NEMs for short.
513.817	Think of it as a regulated public utility.
515.666	So it's on a par with the water supply or the road network.
518.55	And it's a series of markets for low-level trade
522.666	that can be fulfilled by a person or a small company.
525.483	And government has certain benefits
528.232	it can uniquely bestow on these markets.
530.782	It's about public spending going through these markets
533.566	to buy public services at the local level.
536.165	It's about interfacing these markets
537.9	direct into the highest official channels in the land.
541.55	It's about enshrining government's role as a publicist for these markets.
544.95	It's about deregulating some sectors
547.732	so that local people can enter them.
549.165	So, taxi journeys might be one example.
551.417	And there are certain obligations that should go with those benefits
556.199	to be placed on the operators,
557.8	and the key one is, of course,
559.3	that the operators pay for everything,
562.166	including all the interfacing into the public sector.
565.167	So imagine that the operators make their return
568.733	by building a percentage markup into each transaction.
571.916	Imagine that there's a concession period
574.35	defined of maybe 15 years
576.783	in which they can take all these benefits and run with them.
581.249	And imagine that the consortia who bid to run it are told,
584.566	whoever comes in at the lowest percentage markup on each transaction
588.199	to fund the whole thing
589.691	will get the deal.
591.066	So government then exits the frame.
592.866	This is now in the hands of the consortium.
594.499	Either they are going to unlock an awful lot of economic opportunity
597.05	and make a percentage on all of it
599.134	or it's all going to crash and burn,
600.733	which is tough on their shareholders.
602.35	It doesn't bother the taxpayer necessarily.
604.8	And there would be no constraints on alternative markets.
609.45	So this would just be one more choice
611.883	among millions of Internet forums.
614.699	But it could be very different,
617.249	because having access to those state-backed facilities
620.867	could incentivize this consortium
623.2	to seriously invest in the service.
625.317	Because they would have to get a lot of these small transactions going
628.384	to start making their return.
630.115	So we're talking about sectors like home hair care,
635.006	the hire of toys, farm work,
638.963	hire of clothes even, meals delivered to your door,
642.582	services for tourists, home care.
644.389	This would be a world of very small trades, but very well-informed,
651.172	because national e-markets will deliver data.
655.039	So this is a local person
657.672	potentially deciding whether to enter the babysitting market.
660.672	And they might be aware that they would have to fund vetting and training
663.521	if they wanted to go into that market.
664.921	They'd have to do assessment interviews with local parents
667.539	who wanted a pool of babysitters.
669.039	Is it worth their while?
670.44	Should they be looking at other sectors?
672.14	Should they be moving to another part of the country
674.024	where there's a shortage of babysitters?
676.273	This kind of data can become routine.
678.623	And this data can be used by investors.
680.657	So if there's a problem with a shortage of babysitters in some parts of the country
683.823	and the problem is nobody can afford the vetting and training,
686.722	an investor can pay for it
688.306	and the system will tithe back the enhanced earnings of the individuals
691.99	for maybe the next two years.
693.639	This is a world of atomized capitalism.
696.94	So it's small trades by small people,
698.972	but it's very informed, safe, convenient, low-overhead and immediate.
705.839	Some rough research suggests this could unlock
708.764	around 100 million pounds' worth a day of new economic activity
712.965	in a country the size of the U.K.
714.915	Does that sound improbable to you?
717.648	That's what a lot of people said about turbo trading
721.781	in financial exchanges 20 years ago.
724.833	Do not underestimate the transformative power
727.933	of truly modern markets.
731.089	Thank you.
732.715	(Applause)
