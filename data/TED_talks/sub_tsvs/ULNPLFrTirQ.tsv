12.97	So, I love making tools
12.97	and sharing them with people.
16.938	I remember as a child,
18.352	my first tool I built
18.352	was actually a microscope
21.669	that I built by stealing lenses
21.669	from my brother's eyeglasses.
26.109	He wasn't that thrilled.
27.92	But, you know, maybe
27.92	because of that moment,
31.291	I'm still making microscopes.
34.179	And the reason I built these tools
34.179	is for moments like this.
39.379	(Video) Girl: I have
39.379	black things in my hair --
41.823	Manu Prakash: This is a school
41.823	in the Bay Area.
44.66	(Video) MP: The living world
44.66	far supersedes our imagination
49.148	of how things actually work.
51.139	(Video) Boy: Oh my God!
55.593	MP: Right -- oh my God!
58.441	I hadn't realized this would be
58.441	such a universal phrase.
62.943	Over the last two years,
64.767	in my lab,
65.958	we built 50,000 Foldscopes
68.057	and shipped them
68.057	to 130 countries in the world,
70.991	at no cost to the kids we sent them to.
74.058	This year alone,
75.325	with the support of our community,
77.481	we are planning to ship
77.481	a million microscopes
79.985	to kids around the world.
81.854	What does that do?
83.448	It creates an inspiring community
83.448	of people around the world,
87.228	learning and teaching each other,
88.924	from Kenya to Kampala
88.924	to Kathmandu to Kansas.
93.038	And one of the phenomenal things
93.038	that I love about this
95.707	is the sense of community.
97.691	There's a kid in Nicaragua
99.107	teaching others how to identify
99.107	mosquito species that carry dengue
103.325	by looking at the larva
103.325	under a microscope.
105.767	There's a pharmacologist
105.767	who came up with a new way
108.339	to detect fake drugs anywhere.
111.222	There is a girl who wondered:
113.305	"""How does glitter actually work?"""
115.027	and discovered the physics
115.027	of crystalline formation in glitter.
119.533	There is an Argentinian doctor
121.162	who's trying to do field cervical cancer
121.162	screening with this tool.
125.448	And yours very truly found
125.448	a species of flea
129.21	that was dug inside my heel in my foot
129.21	one centimeter deep.
135.141	Now, you might think
135.141	of these as anomalies.
139.795	But there is a method to this madness.
142.437	"I call this ""frugal science"" --"
144.691	the idea of sharing
144.691	the experience of science,
148.567	and not just the information.
150.831	To remind you:
152.07	there are a billion people on this planet
154.178	who live with absolutely
154.178	no infrastructure:
156.717	no roads,
158.355	no electricity
159.761	and thus, no health care.
162.787	Also, there a billion kids
162.787	on this planet that live in poverty.
167.52	How are we supposed to inspire them
169.212	for the next generation
169.212	of solution makers?
172.084	There are health care workers
172.084	that we put on the line
174.856	to fight infectious diseases,
176.798	to protect us with absolutely
176.798	bare-minimum tools and resources.
182.404	So as a lab at Stanford,
184.022	I think of this from a context
184.022	of frugal science
187.983	and building solutions
187.983	for these communities.
190.592	Often we think about being able to do
190.592	diagnosis under a tree, off-grid.
195.636	I'll tell you two examples
195.636	today of new tools.
198.389	One of them starts in Uganda.
200.571	In 2013,
202.124	on a field trip to detect
202.124	schistosomiasis with Foldscopes,
206.194	I made a minor observation.
208.776	In a clinic,
210.377	in a far, remote area,
211.74	I saw a centrifuge
211.74	being used as a doorstop.
216.012	I mean -- quite literally, the doorstop.
218.427	And I asked them and they said,
220.177	"""Oh, we don't actually have electricity,"
222.228	so this piece of junk
222.228	"is good as a doorstop."""
226.444	Centrifuges, for some of you
226.444	who don't know,
229.17	are the pinnacle tool to be able
229.17	to do sample processing.
232.418	You separate components
232.418	of blood or body fluids
235.184	to be able to detect
235.184	and identify pathogens.
238.239	But centrifuges are bulky, expensive --
241.097	cost around 1,000 dollars --
243.315	and really hard to carry out in the field.
245.345	And of course,
246.526	they don't work without power.
247.984	Sound familiar?
249.4	So we started thinking
249.4	about solving this problem,
251.972	and I came back --
253.546	kept thinking about toys.
255.638	Now ...
257.85	I have a few with me here.
259.632	I first started with yo-yos ...
261.763	and I'm a terrible yo-yo thrower.
264.743	Because these objects spin,
266.448	we wondered,
267.634	could we actually use
267.634	the physics of these objects
270.015	to be able to build centrifuges?
273.077	This was possibly the worst
273.077	throw I could make.
276.256	But you might start realizing,
277.773	if you start exploring
277.773	the space of toys --
280.636	we tried these spinning tops,
283.265	and then in the lab,
285.171	we stumbled upon this wonder.
287.59	It's the whirligig,
287.59	or a buzzer, or a rundle.
291.1	A couple of strings and a little disk,
293.541	and if I push, it spins.
296.17	How many of you have played
296.17	with this as a kid?
298.538	This is called a button-on-a-string.
300.41	OK, maybe 50 percent of you.
302.07	What you didn't realize --
303.652	that this little object
305.989	is the oldest toy
305.989	in the history of mankind ...
310.827	5,000 years ago.
312.496	We have found relics of this object
312.496	hidden around on our planet.
316.924	Now the irony is,
318.889	we actually don't understand
318.889	how this little thing works.
322.648	That's when I get excited.
324.617	So we got back to work,
326.722	wrote down a couple of equations.
328.876	If you take the input torque
328.876	that you put in,
332.213	you take the drag on this disc,
334.341	and the twist drag on these strings,
336.27	you should be able
336.27	to mathematically solve this.
338.783	This is not the only equation in my talk.
341.615	Ten pages of math later,
343.471	we could actually write down
343.471	the complete analytical solution
346.354	for this dynamic system.
348.208	"And out comes what we call ""Paperfuge."""
351.843	That's my postdoc Saad Bhamla,
354.411	who's the co-inventor of Paperfuge.
356.102	And to the left, you see
356.102	all the centrifuges
358.371	that we're trying to replace.
359.822	This little object that you see right here
364.759	is a disc, a couple
364.759	of strings and a handle.
368.028	And when I spin
369.76	and I push,
370.937	it starts to spin.
372.113	Now, when you realize,
374.77	when you do the math,
377.399	when we calculate the rpm for this object,
379.913	mathematically, we should be able
379.913	to go all the way to a million rpm.
384.669	Now, there is a little twist
384.669	in human anatomy,
386.886	because the resonant frequency
386.886	of this object is about 10 hertz,
389.985	and if you've ever played the piano,
391.813	you can't go higher
391.813	than two or three hertz.
393.931	The maximum speed we've been able
393.931	to achieve with this object
397.219	is not 10,000 rpm,
399.172	not 50,000 rpm --
402.749	That's equal to 30,000 g-forces.
405.577	If I was to stick you right here
405.577	and have it spin,
408.808	you would think about the types
408.808	of forces you would experience.
412.261	One of the factors of a tool like this
414.523	is to be able to do diagnosis with this.
417.541	So, I'm going to do
417.541	a quick demo here, where --
422.262	this is a moment where I'm going
422.262	to make a little finger prick,
425.881	and a tiny drop of blood
425.881	is going to come out.
428.18	If you don't like blood,
428.18	you don't have to look at it.
430.825	Here is a little lancet.
432.188	These lancets are available everywhere,
434.082	completely passive.
435.629	And if I've had breakfast today ...
441.867	That didn't hurt at all.
443.378	OK, I take a little capillary
443.378	with a drop of blood --
447.386	now this drop of blood has answers,
449.669	that's why I'm interested in it.
451.73	It might actually tell me whether
451.73	I have malaria right now or not.
455.221	I take a little capillary,
457.077	and you see it starts wicking in.
459.708	I'm going to draw a little more blood.
464.602	And that's good enough for right now.
467.339	Now, I just seal this capillary
467.339	by putting it in clay.
475.312	And now that's sealed the sample.
477.616	We're going to take the sample,
479.769	mount it on Paperfuge.
488.912	A little piece of tape
488.912	to make a sealed cavity.
492.795	So now the sample is completely enclosed.
498.927	And we are ready for a spin.
502.839	I'm pushing and pulling with this object.
504.904	I'm going to load this up ...
508.097	And you see the object starts spinning.
510.404	Unlike a regular centrifuge,
512.442	this is a counter-rotating centrifuge.
516.245	It goes back and forth, back and forth ...
519.041	And now I'm charging it up,
521.193	and you see it builds momentum.
524.005	And now -- I don't know
524.005	if you can hear this --
528.809	and I should be able to separate
528.809	all the blood cells with the plasma.
533.758	And the ratio of those blood 
533.758	cells to plasma --
536.595	(Applause)
540.259	Already, if you see right here,
544.026	if you focus on this,
545.674	you should be able to see
545.674	a separated volume
549.092	of blood and plasma.
550.974	And the ratio of that actually tells me
550.974	whether I might be anemic.
554.921	One of the aspects of this is,
554.921	we build many types of Paperfuges.
558.982	This one allows us to identify
558.982	malaria parasites
563.472	by running them for a little longer,
565.313	and we can identify malaria parasites
565.313	that are in the blood
568.903	that we can separate out and detect
568.903	with something like a centrifuge.
572.501	Another version of this allows me
572.501	to separate nucleic acids
577.005	to be able to do nucleic acid tests
577.005	out in the field itself.
581.393	Here is another version that allows me
581.393	to separate bulk samples,
585.761	and then, finally,
587.355	something new that we've been working on
589.379	to be able to implement the entire
589.379	multiplex test on an object like this.
594.198	So where you do the sample preparation
594.198	and the chemistry in the same object.
599.36	Now ...
600.67	this is all good,
601.964	but when you start thinking about this,
603.895	you have to share these tools with people.
606.008	And one of the things we did is --
606.008	we just got back from Madagascar;
609.414	this is what clinical trials
609.414	for malaria look like --
612.016	(Laughter)
613.043	You can do this while having coffee.
615.424	But most importantly,
617.321	this is a village six hours from any road.
621.856	We are in a room with one of the senior
621.856	members of the community
626.443	and a health care worker.
627.98	It really is this portion of the work
627.98	that excites me the most --
631.501	that smile,
632.683	to be able to share simple but powerful
632.683	tools with people around the world.
637.299	Now, I forgot to tell you this,
639.625	that all of that cost me 20 cents to make.
643.33	OK, in the negative time I have left,
646.236	I'll tell you about the most recent --
648.326	(Laughter)
649.47	invention from our lab.
651.364	It's called Abuzz --
653.438	the idea that all of you
653.438	could help us fight mosquitoes;
657.596	you could all help us track our enemies.
659.887	These are enemies because they cause
659.887	malaria, Zika, chikungunya, dengue.
663.899	But the challenge is that we actually
663.899	don't know where our enemies are.
668.707	The world map for where
668.707	mosquitoes are is missing.
672.123	So we started thinking about this.
673.89	There are 3,500 species of mosquitoes,
675.949	and they're all very similar.
677.376	Some of them are so identical
678.839	that even an entomologist cannot
678.839	identify them under a microscope.
682.916	But they have an Achilles' heel.
684.725	This is what mosquitoes flirting
684.725	with each other looks like.
687.949	That's a male chasing a female.
690.202	They're actually talking to each other
690.202	with their wingbeat frequencies.
694.047	(Buzzing sound)
695.111	And thus, they have a signature.
698.472	We realized that using a regular phone,
701.86	a $5-10 flip phone --
704.425	how many remember what this object is?
706.551	(Laughter)
707.635	We can record these acoustic
707.635	signatures from mosquitoes.
711.82	I'll tell you exactly how to do this.
713.78	I caught some mosquitoes outside.
715.495	Unlike Bill [Gates], I'm not
715.495	going to release them.
717.907	(Laughter)
718.971	But I will tell you how
718.971	to record from this.
721.57	All you do is tap them and they fly.
724.036	You can first test --
725.401	I can actually hear that.
727.177	And you bring your phone,
727.177	which has microphones --
729.655	it turns out the mics
729.655	are so damn good already,
732.045	even on regular phones,
733.309	that you can pick up
733.309	this near-field signature.
735.766	And since I'm out of time,
737.928	let me just play the recording
737.928	that I made a day ago.
741.644	(Mosquitoes buzz)
744.208	This is all the charming sound
744.208	that you heard before
747.16	that you all love.
750.606	One of the contexts of this
752.051	is that being able to do this
752.051	with a regular cell phone
755.289	allows us to map mosquito species.
759.477	Using a flip phone,
761.193	we mapped one of the largest
761.193	acoustic databases
764.195	with 25 to 20 species of mosquitoes
764.195	that carry human pathogens.
769.447	And from this and machine learning,
771.15	anybody who uploads this data,
772.958	we can identify and tell the probability
774.97	of what species of mosquitoes
774.97	you're actually working with.
777.828	We call this Abuzz,
777.828	and if any of you want to sign up,
780.667	just go to the website.
782.343	Let me close with something
784.009	that's very important
784.009	and dear to my heart.
787.324	One of the challenges of today
787.324	is we have terrible problems.
791.295	We have a billion people
791.295	with absolutely no health care,
794.217	climate change, biodiversity loss,
796.366	on and on and on.
798.046	And we hope that science
798.046	is going to provide the answer.
801.41	But before you leave this theatre today,
803.582	I want you to promise one thing.
805.745	We're going to make science accessible --
808.886	not just to the people who can afford it,
811.049	but a billion others who can't.
813.581	Let's make science and scientific
813.581	literacy a human right.
819.384	The moment that you pass the tingling
819.384	feeling of making a discovery
824.083	to another child,
826.263	you're enabling them to be
826.263	the next group of people
830.079	who will actually solve these problems.
832.211	Thank you.
833.41	(Applause)
