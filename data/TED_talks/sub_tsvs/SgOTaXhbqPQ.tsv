12.16	We see with the eyes,
15.16	but we see with the brain as well.
18.16	And seeing with the brain
18.16	is often called imagination.
22.16	And we are familiar with
22.16	the landscapes of our own imagination,
27.16	our inscapes. 
27.16	We've lived with them all our lives.
31.16	But there are also hallucinations as well,
35.16	and hallucinations 
35.16	are completely different.
38.16	They don't seem to be of our creation.
40.16	They don't seem to be under our control.
42.16	They seem to come from the outside,
44.16	and to mimic perception.
47.16	So I am going to be talking
47.16	about hallucinations,
51.16	and a particular sort
51.16	of visual hallucination
55.16	which I see among my patients.
60.16	A few months ago, I got a phone call
64.16	from a nursing home where I work.
66.16	They told me that one of their residents,
66.16	an old lady in her 90s,
71.16	was seeing things,
73.16	and they wondered if she'd gone bonkers
76.16	or, because she was an old lady,
78.16	whether she'd had a stroke,
78.16	or whether she had Alzheimer's.
81.16	And so they asked me if
81.16	I would come and see Rosalie,
86.16	the old lady.
88.16	I went in to see her.
90.16	It was evident straight away
92.16	that she was perfectly sane
95.16	and lucid and 
95.16	of good intelligence,
98.16	but she'd been very startled
98.16	and very bewildered,
102.16	because she'd been seeing things.
105.16	And she told me --
108.16	the nurses hadn't mentioned this --
110.16	that she was blind,
112.16	that she had been completely blind
112.16	from macular degeneration for five years.
117.16	But now, for the last few days,
117.16	she'd been seeing things.
120.16	"So I said, ""What sort of things?"""
123.16	"And she said, ""People in Eastern dress,"
126.16	in drapes, walking up and down stairs.
130.16	A man who turns towards me and smiles.
133.16	But he has huge teeth
133.16	on one side of his mouth.
137.16	Animals too.
139.16	I see a white building.
139.16	It's snowing, a soft snow.
142.16	I see this horse with a harness,
142.16	dragging the snow away.
147.16	Then, one night, the scene changes.
151.16	I see cats and dogs walking towards me.
153.16	They come to a certain point
153.16	and then stop.
156.16	Then it changes again.
158.16	I see a lot of children.
158.16	They are walking up and down stairs.
161.16	They wear bright colors, rose and blue,
164.16	"like Eastern dress."""
167.16	Sometimes, she said,
167.16	before the people come on,
170.16	she may hallucinate
170.16	pink and blue squares on the floor,
174.16	which seem to go up to the ceiling.
177.16	"I said, ""Is this like a dream?"""
181.16	"And she said, ""No, it's not"
181.16	"like a dream. It's like a movie."""
184.16	"She said, ""It's got color."
184.16	It's got motion.
187.16	But it's completely silent,
187.16	"like a silent movie."""
191.16	And she said that
191.16	it's a rather boring movie.
193.16	"She said, ""All these people"
193.16	with Eastern dress,
196.16	walking up and down,
196.16	"very repetitive, very limited."""
201.16	(Laughter)
203.16	And she has a sense of humor.
205.16	She knew it was a hallucination.
207.16	But she was frightened.
207.16	She'd lived 95 years
209.16	and she'd never had
209.16	a hallucination before.
212.16	She said that the hallucinations
212.16	were unrelated
215.16	to anything she was thinking
215.16	or feeling or doing,
219.16	that they seemed to come on
219.16	by themselves, or disappear.
223.16	She had no control over them.
225.16	She said she didn't recognize
227.16	any of the people or places
229.16	in the hallucinations.
231.16	And none of the people
231.16	or the animals,
233.16	well, they all seemed oblivious of her.
237.16	And she didn't know what was going on.
239.16	She wondered if she was going mad
241.16	or losing her mind.
243.16	Well, I examined her carefully.
245.16	She was a bright old lady,
247.16	perfectly sane. She had
247.16	no medical problems.
251.16	She wasn't on any medications
251.16	which could produce hallucinations.
255.16	But she was blind.
257.16	And I then said to her,
259.16	"""I think I know what you have."""
261.16	"I said, ""There is a special form"
261.16	of visual hallucination
265.16	which may go with deteriorating
265.16	vision or blindness.
269.16	"This was originally described,"" I said,"
272.16	"""right back in the 18th century,"
274.16	by a man called Charles Bonnet.
277.16	And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome.
280.16	There is nothing wrong with your brain.
280.16	There is nothing wrong with your mind.
282.16	"You have Charles Bonnet syndrome."""
285.16	And she was very relieved at this,
288.16	that there was nothing
288.16	seriously the matter,
292.16	and also rather curious.
295.16	"She said, ""Who is this Charles Bonnet?"""
297.16	"She said, ""Did he have them himself?"""
300.16	"And she said, ""Tell all the nurses"
303.16	"that I have Charles Bonnet syndrome."""
306.16	(Laughter)
308.16	"""I'm not crazy. I'm not demented."
308.16	"I have Charles Bonnet syndrome."""
312.16	Well, so I did tell the nurses.
314.16	Now this, for me, is a common situation.
317.16	I work in old-age homes, largely.
319.16	I see a lot of elderly people
321.16	who are hearing impaired
321.16	or visually impaired.
325.16	About 10 percent
325.16	of the hearing impaired people
327.16	get musical hallucinations.
330.16	And about 10 percent
330.16	of the visually impaired people
333.16	get visual hallucinations.
335.16	You don't have to be completely blind,
337.16	only sufficiently impaired.
339.16	Now with the original description
339.16	in the 18th century,
343.16	Charles Bonnet did not have them.
345.16	His grandfather had these hallucinations.
348.16	His grandfather was a magistrate,
348.16	an elderly man.
351.16	He'd had cataract surgery.
354.16	His vision was pretty poor.
356.16	And in 1759, he described to his grandson
361.16	various things he was seeing.
363.16	The first thing he said was he saw
365.16	a handkerchief in midair.
367.16	It was a large blue handkerchief
369.16	with four orange circles.
371.16	And he knew it was a hallucination.
374.16	You don't have handkerchiefs in midair.
376.16	And then he saw a big wheel in midair.
380.16	But sometimes he wasn't sure
380.16	whether he was hallucinating or not,
385.16	because the hallucinations would fit
387.16	in the context of the visions.
389.16	So on one occasion,
389.16	when his granddaughters were visiting them,
392.16	"he said, ""And who are these"
392.16	"handsome young men with you?"""
397.16	"And they said, ""Alas, Grandpapa,"
397.16	"there are no handsome young men."""
401.16	And then the handsome
401.16	young men disappeared.
405.16	It's typical of these hallucinations
408.16	that they may come in a flash
408.16	and disappear in a flash.
411.16	They don't usually fade in and out.
413.16	They are rather sudden,
413.16	and they change suddenly.
416.16	Charles Lullin, the grandfather,
419.16	saw hundreds of different figures,
422.16	different landscapes of all sorts.
424.16	On one occasion, he saw a man
424.16	in a bathrobe smoking a pipe,
428.16	and realized it was himself.
431.16	That was the only figure he recognized.
434.16	On one occasion when he was walking
434.16	in the streets of Paris,
438.16	he saw -- this was real -- a scaffolding.
441.16	But when he got back home,
441.16	he saw a miniature of the scaffolding
444.16	six inches high, on his study table.
448.16	This repetition of perception
451.16	is sometimes called palinopsia.
453.16	With him and with Rosalie,
458.16	what seems to be going on --
460.16	"and Rosalie said, ""What's going on?"" --"
462.16	and I said that as you lose vision,
465.16	as the visual parts of the brain
465.16	are no longer getting any input,
468.16	they become hyperactive and excitable,
471.16	and they start to fire spontaneously.
473.16	And you start to see things.
476.16	The things you see
476.16	can be very complicated indeed.
479.16	With another patient of mine,
483.16	who, also had some vision,
485.16	the vision she had could be disturbing.
489.16	On one occasion, she said she saw
492.16	a man in a striped shirt in a restaurant.
495.16	And he turned around. And then
497.16	he divided into six figures
497.16	in striped shirts,
500.16	who started walking towards her.
503.16	And then the six figures came together again,
503.16	like a concertina.
506.16	Once, when she was driving,
508.16	or rather, her husband was driving,
510.16	the road divided into four
512.16	and she felt herself going
512.16	simultaneously up four roads.
516.16	She had very mobile
516.16	hallucinations as well.
521.16	A lot of them had to do with a car.
524.16	Sometimes she would see a teenage boy
526.16	sitting on the hood of the car.
529.16	He was very tenacious
529.16	and he moved rather gracefully
531.16	when the car turned.
533.16	And then when they came to a stop,
536.16	the boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff,
539.16	and then disappear.
542.16	Another patient of mine
542.16	had a different sort of hallucination.
547.16	This was a woman who
547.16	didn't have trouble with her eyes,
550.16	but the visual parts of her brain,
552.16	a little tumor in the occipital cortex.
555.16	And, above all, she would see cartoons.
560.16	These cartoons would be transparent
565.16	and would cover
565.16	half the visual field, like a screen.
568.16	And especially she saw
568.16	cartoons of Kermit the Frog.
574.16	(Laughter)
575.16	Now, I don't watch Sesame Street,
578.16	but she made a point of saying,
581.16	"""Why Kermit?"" she said,"
581.16	"""Kermit the Frog means nothing to me."
585.16	You know, I was wondering
585.16	about Freudian determinants.
588.16	Why Kermit?
590.16	"Kermit the Frog means nothing to me."""
592.16	She didn't mind the cartoons too much.
594.16	But what did disturb her
594.16	was she got very persistent
598.16	images or hallucinations of faces
601.16	and as with Rosalie,
601.16	the faces were often deformed,
604.16	with very large teeth or very large eyes.
608.16	And these frightened her.
611.16	Well, what is going on with these people?
615.16	As a physician, I have to try
615.16	and define what's going on,
618.16	and to reassure people,
620.16	especially to reassure them
620.16	that they're not going insane.
624.16	Something like 10 percent, as I said,
627.16	of visually impaired people get these.
630.16	But no more than one percent
630.16	of the people acknowledge them,
634.16	because they are afraid
634.16	they will be seen as insane or something.
637.16	And if they do mention them
637.16	to their own doctors
639.16	they may be misdiagnosed.
642.16	In particular,
642.16	the notion is that if you see
644.16	things or hear things, you're going mad,
647.16	but the psychotic hallucinations 
647.16	are quite different.
650.16	Psychotic hallucinations,
650.16	whether they are visual or vocal,
653.16	they address you. They accuse you.
655.16	They seduce you. They humiliate you.
657.16	They jeer at you.
660.16	You interact with them.
662.16	There is none of this quality
662.16	of being addressed
665.16	with these Charles Bonnet hallucinations.
668.16	There is a film. You're seeing a film
668.16	which has nothing to do with you,
672.16	or that's how people think about it.
675.16	There is also a rare thing
675.16	called temporal lobe epilepsy,
679.16	and sometimes, if one has this,
682.16	one may feel oneself transported back
684.16	to a time and place in the past.
687.16	You're at a particular road junction.
689.16	You smell chestnuts roasting.
691.16	You hear the traffic.
691.16	All the senses are involved.
694.16	And you're waiting for your girl.
696.16	And it's that Tuesday
696.16	evening back in 1982.
700.16	And the temporal lobe hallucinations
702.16	are all-sense hallucinations,
704.16	full of feeling, full of familiarity,
707.16	located in space and time,
709.16	coherent, dramatic.
711.16	The Charles Bonnet
711.16	ones are quite different.
714.16	So in the Charles Bonnet hallucinations,
718.16	you have all sorts of levels,
720.16	from the geometrical hallucinations --
722.16	the pink and blue squares the woman had --
725.16	up to quite elaborate hallucinations
729.16	with figures and especially faces.
732.16	Faces, and sometimes deformed faces,
735.16	are the single commonest thing
738.16	in these hallucinations.
740.16	And one of the second
740.16	commonest is cartoons.
743.16	So, what is going on?
746.16	Fascinatingly, in the last few years,
748.16	it's been possible to do
748.16	functional brain imagery,
752.16	to do fMRI on people
752.16	as they are hallucinating.
756.16	And in fact, to find that different parts
760.16	of the visual brain are activated
763.16	as they are hallucinating.
765.16	When people have these
765.16	simple geometrical hallucinations,
768.16	the primary visual cortex is activated.
772.16	This is the part of the brain
772.16	which perceives edges and patterns.
775.16	You don't form images
775.16	with your primary visual cortex.
779.16	When images are formed,
782.16	a higher part of the visual cortex
784.16	is involved in the temporal lobe.
786.16	And in particular,
786.16	one area of the temporal lobe
791.16	is called the fusiform gyrus.
793.16	And it's known that if people
793.16	have damage in the fusiform gyrus,
797.16	they maybe lose
797.16	the ability to recognize faces.
801.16	But if there is an abnormal activity
801.16	in the fusiform gyrus,
805.16	they may hallucinate faces,
807.16	and this is exactly what you find
807.16	in some of these people.
810.16	There is an area
810.16	in the anterior part of this gyrus
814.16	where teeth and eyes are represented,
819.16	and that part of the gyrus is activated
822.16	when people get
822.16	the deformed hallucinations.
826.16	There is another part of the brain
828.16	which is especially activated
830.16	when one sees cartoons.
832.16	It's activated when
832.16	one recognizes cartoons,
835.16	when one draws cartoons,
835.16	and when one hallucinates them.
839.16	It's very interesting
839.16	that that should be specific.
842.16	There are other parts of the brain
842.16	which are specifically involved
845.16	with the recognition and hallucination
847.16	of buildings and landscapes.
850.16	Around 1970, it was found
850.16	that there were not only parts of the brain,
853.16	but particular cells.
855.16	"""Face cells"" were discovered around 1970."
860.16	And now we know
860.16	that there are hundreds of other
862.16	sorts of cells,
864.16	which can be very, very specific.
866.16	So you may not only have
868.16	"""car"" cells,"
870.16	"you may have ""Aston Martin"" cells."
873.16	(Laughter)
875.16	I saw an Aston Martin this morning.
877.16	I had to bring it in.
879.16	And now it's in there somewhere.
882.16	(Laughter)
885.16	Now, at this level, in what's called
885.16	the inferotemporal cortex,
889.16	there are only visual images,
892.16	or figments or fragments.
895.16	It's only at higher levels
898.16	that the other senses join in
900.16	and there are connections
900.16	with memory and emotion.
902.16	And in the Charles Bonnet syndrome,
905.16	you don't go to those higher levels.
907.16	You're in these levels
907.16	of inferior visual cortex
910.16	where you have thousands
910.16	and tens of thousands
912.16	and millions of images,
915.16	or figments,
915.16	or fragmentary figments,
917.16	all neurally encoded
919.16	in particular cells
919.16	or small clusters of cells.
923.16	Normally these are all part of
926.16	the integrated stream
926.16	of perception, or imagination,
930.16	and one is not conscious of them.
933.16	It is only if one
933.16	is visually impaired or blind
937.16	that the process is interrupted.
939.16	And instead of getting normal perception,
942.16	you're getting an anarchic,
944.16	convulsive stimulation, or release,
947.16	of all of these visual cells
949.16	in the inferotemporal cortex.
951.16	So, suddenly you see a face.
951.16	Suddenly you see a car.
954.16	Suddenly this, and suddenly that.
957.16	The mind does its best to organize
959.16	and to give some sort
959.16	of coherence to this,
962.16	but not terribly successfully.
964.16	When these were first described,
966.16	it was thought that
966.16	they could be interpreted like dreams.
970.16	But in fact people say,
972.16	"""I don't recognize the people."
972.16	"I can't form any associations."""
975.16	"""Kermit means nothing to me."""
978.16	You don't get anywhere
978.16	thinking of them as dreams.
983.16	Well, I've more
983.16	or less said what I wanted.
988.16	I think I just want to recapitulate
991.16	and say this is common.
993.16	Think of the number of blind people.
995.16	There must be hundreds
995.16	of thousands of blind people
997.16	who have these hallucinations,
999.16	but are too scared to mention them.
1001.16	So this sort of thing
1001.16	needs to be brought into
1004.16	notice, for patients,
1004.16	for doctors, for the public.
1010.16	Finally, I think they are
1012.16	infinitely interesting and valuable,
1015.16	for giving one some insight
1015.16	as to how the brain works.
1019.16	Charles Bonnet said, 250 years ago --
1022.16	he wondered how,
1022.16	thinking these hallucinations,
1026.16	how, as he put it,
1026.16	the theater of the mind
1029.16	could be generated
1029.16	by the machinery of the brain.
1032.16	Now, 250 years later,
1035.16	I think we're beginning
1035.16	to glimpse how this is done.
1038.16	Thanks very much.
1040.16	(Applause)
1043.16	Chris Anderson: That was superb.
1043.16	Thank you so much.
1046.16	You speak about these things
1046.16	with so much insight
1048.16	and empathy for your patients.
1051.16	Have you yourself experienced
1051.16	any of the syndromes you write about?
1056.16	Oliver Sacks: I was afraid you'd ask that.
1058.16	(Laughter)
1059.16	Well, yeah, a lot of them.
1062.16	And actually I'm a little
1062.16	visually impaired myself.
1065.16	I'm blind in one eye,
1065.16	and not terribly good in the other.
1068.16	And I see the geometrical hallucinations.
1072.16	But they stop there.
1074.16	CA: And they don't disturb you?
1076.16	Because you understand what's doing it,
1076.16	it doesn't make you worried?
1078.16	OS: Well they don't disturb me
1078.16	any more than my tinnitus,
1082.16	which I ignore.
1085.16	They occasionally interest me,
1087.16	and I have many pictures
1087.16	of them in my notebooks.
1090.16	I've gone and had an fMRI myself,
1093.16	to see how my visual cortex
1093.16	is taking over.
1096.16	And when I see all these hexagons
1100.16	and complex things,
1100.16	which I also have,
1102.16	in visual migraine,
1104.16	I wonder whether everyone
1104.16	sees things like this,
1106.16	and whether things
1106.16	like cave art or ornamental art
1109.16	may have been derived from them a bit.
1112.16	CA: That was an utterly,
1112.16	utterly fascinating talk.
1114.16	Thank you so much for sharing.
1116.16	OS: Thank you. Thank you.
