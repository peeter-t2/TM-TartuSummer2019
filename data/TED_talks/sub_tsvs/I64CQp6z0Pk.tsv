12.882	So, I have a feature on my website where every week
15.391	people submit hypothetical questions
17.391	for me to answer,
18.979	and I try to answer them using math, science
21.36	and comics.
22.82	So for example, one person asked,
25.228	what would happen if you tried to hit a baseball
26.922	pitched at 90 percent of the speed of light?
29.328	So I did some calculations.
32.28	Now, normally, when an object flies through the air,
34.547	the air will flow around the object,
36.021	but in this case, the ball would be going so fast
37.95	that the air molecules wouldn't have time
39.401	to move out of the way.
41.02	The ball would smash right into and through them,
44.007	and the collisions with these air molecules
45.668	would knock away the nitrogen,
47.333	carbon and hydrogen from the ball,
49.291	fragmenting it off into tiny particles,
51.128	and also triggering waves of thermonuclear fusion
53.612	in the air around it.
55.14	This would result in a flood of x-rays
57.305	that would spread out in a bubble
59.056	along with exotic particles,
60.482	plasma inside, centered on the pitcher's mound,
63.602	and that would move away from the pitcher's mound
67.144	slightly faster than the ball.
69.629	Now at this point, about 30 nanoseconds in,
72.311	the home plate is far enough away
74.214	that light hasn't had time to reach it,
76.12	which means the batter
77.571	still sees the pitcher about to throw
80.335	and has no idea that anything is wrong.
82.352	(Laughter)
84.624	Now, after 70 nanoseconds,
87.05	the ball will reach home plate,
88.504	or at least the cloud of expanding plasma
91.241	that used to be the ball,
93.37	and it will engulf the bat and the batter
97.135	and the plate and the catcher and the umpire
100.596	and start disintegrating them all
103.401	as it also starts to carry them backward
106.567	through the backstop, which
106.567	also starts to disintegrate.
110.031	So if you were watching this whole thing
111.801	from a hill,
113.108	ideally, far away,
116.481	what you'd see is a bright flash of light
117.936	that would fade over a few seconds,
119.442	followed by a blast wave spreading out,
121.57	shredding trees and houses
124.03	as it moves away from the stadium,
126.149	and then eventually a mushroom cloud
129.081	rising up over the ruined city. (Laughter)
132.842	So the Major League Baseball rules
133.998	are a little bit hazy,
136.102	but — (Laughter) — under rule 6.02 and 5.09,
140.987	I think that in this situation,
142.596	the batter would be considered hit by pitch
145.049	and would be eligible to take first base,
147.683	if it still existed.
150.886	So this is the kind of question I answer,
152.682	and I get people writing in with
154.821	a lot of other strange questions.
156.695	I've had someone write and say,
159.242	scientifically speaking, what is the best
161.161	and fastest way to hide a body?
163.231	Can you do this one soon?
165.453	And I had someone write in,
167.313	I've had people write in about,
169.328	can you prove whether or not you can find love again
171.532	after your heart's broken?
173.204	And I've had people send in
174.979	what are clearly homework questions
176.97	they're trying to get me to do for them.
180.113	But one week, a couple months ago,
183.018	I got a question that was actually about Google.
186.679	If all digital data in the world
186.679	were stored on punch cards,
189.645	how big would Google's data warehouse be?
192.324	Now, Google's pretty secretive
192.324	about their operations,
195.046	so no one really knows how much data Google has,
198.422	and in fact, no one really knows
198.422	how many data centers Google has,
200.937	except people at Google itself.
203.428	And I've tried, I've met them a few times,
204.662	tried asking them, and they
204.662	aren't revealing anything.
209.885	So I decided to try to figure this out myself.
212.42	There are a few things that I looked at here.
214.579	I started with money.
216.485	Google has to reveal how much they spend,
218.627	in general, and that lets you put some caps
220.617	on how many data centers could they be building,
224.403	because a big data center costs
224.403	a certain amount of money.
226.703	And you can also then put a cap on
229.135	how much of the world hard
229.135	drive market are they taking up,
231.466	which turns out, it's pretty sizable.
233.418	I read a calculation at one point,
235.355	I think Google has a drive failure
236.82	about every minute or two,
240.074	and they just throw out the hard drive
241.424	and swap in a new one.
242.81	So they go through a huge number of them.
245.01	And so by looking at money,
246.121	you can get an idea of how
246.121	many of these centers they have.
248.97	You can also look at power.
250.83	You can look at how much electricity they need,
254.727	because you need a certain amount
254.727	of electricity to run the servers,
256.534	and Google is more efficient than most,
258.573	but they still have some basic requirements,
261.67	and that lets you put a limit
263.586	on the number of servers that they have.
265.533	You can also look at square footage and see
269.724	of the data centers that you know,
271	how big are they?
272.353	How much room is that?
273.275	How many server racks could you fit in there?
275.635	And for some data centers,
277.338	you might get two of these pieces of information.
279.327	You know how much they spent,
281.023	and they also, say, because they had to contract
283.38	with the local government
284.799	to get the power provided,
286.479	you might know what they made a deal to buy,
289.136	so you know how much power it takes.
290.89	Then you can look at the ratios of those numbers,
293.184	and figure out for a data center
294.713	where you don't have that information,
296.349	you can figure out,
297.441	but maybe you only have one of those,
299.628	you know the square footage,
299.628	then you could figure out
301.307	well, maybe the power is proportional.
303.63	And you can do this same thing
303.63	with a lot of different quantities,
305.95	you know, with guesses about
305.95	the total amount of storage,
308.026	the number of servers, the
308.026	number of drives per server,
310.619	and in each case using what you know
313.666	to come up with a model that narrows down
316.193	your guesses for the things that you don't know.
318.323	It's sort of circling around the
318.323	number you're trying to get.
320.588	And this is a lot of fun.
323.143	The math is not all that advanced,
325.325	and really it's like nothing more than
328.46	solving a sudoku puzzle.
330.472	So what I did, I went through all of this information,
335.781	spent a day or two researching.
337.54	And there are some things I didn't look at.
339.579	You could always look at the Google
342.622	recruitment messages that they post.
344.439	That gives you an idea of where they have people.
346.377	Sometimes, when people visit a data center,
347.988	they'll take a cell-cam photo and post it,
349.833	and they aren't supposed to,
351.323	but you can learn things about
351.323	their hardware that way.
354.136	And in fact, you can just
354.136	look at pizza delivery drivers.
356.689	Turns out, they know where all
356.689	the Google data centers are,
359.344	at least the ones that have people in them.
362.22	But I came up with my estimate,
364.405	which I felt pretty good about,
366.269	that was about 10 exabytes of data
369.518	across all of Google's operations,
371.94	and then another maybe five exabytes or so
375.372	of offline storage in tape drives,
377.417	which it turns out Google is
378.992	about the world's largest consumer of.
381.502	So I came up with this estimate, and this is
385.063	a staggering amount of data.
386.306	It's quite a bit more than any other organization
389.18	in the world has, as far as we know.
390.927	There's a couple of other contenders,
392.673	especially everyone always thinks of the NSA.
395.017	But using some of these same methods,
396.446	we can look at the NSA's data centers,
398.469	and figure out, you know, we
398.469	don't know what's going on there,
400.951	but it's pretty clear that their operation
403.041	is not the size of Google's.
404.638	Adding all of this up, I came up with
406.377	the other thing that we can answer, which is,
408.273	how many punch cards would this take?
410.258	And so a punch card can hold
413.216	about 80 characters,
415.207	and you can fit about 2,000 or so cards into a box,
418.98	and you put them in, say,
420.254	my home region of New England,
422.206	it would cover the entire region
424.546	up to a depth of a little less than five kilometers,
428.02	which is about three times deeper
429.463	than the glaciers during the last ice age
431.862	about 20,000 years ago.
434.03	So this is impractical, but I think
436.453	that's about the best answer I could come up with.
439.404	And I posted it on my website. I wrote it up.
441.542	And I didn't expect to get an answer from Google,
445.232	because of course they've been so secretive,
446.863	they didn't answer of my questions,
448.267	and so I just put it up and said,
449.774	well, I guess we'll never know.
451.297	But then a little while later
453.321	I got a message, a couple weeks later, from Google,
455.77	saying, hey, someone here has an envelope for you.
459.212	So I go and get it, open it up,
462.013	and it's punch cards. (Laughter)
464.54	Google-branded punch cards.
467.622	And on these punch cards,
467.622	there are a bunch of holes,
470.87	and I said, thank you, thank you,
472.171	okay, so what's on here?
473.69	So I get some software and start reading it,
475.32	and scan them, and it turns out
477.32	it's a puzzle.
478.689	There's a bunch of code,
480.327	and I get some friends to help,
481.581	and we crack the code, and then
481.581	inside that is another code,
484.133	and then there are some equations,
485.428	and then we solve those equations,
486.599	and then finally out pops a message from Google
490.07	which is their official answer to my article,
493.259	"and it said, ""No comment."""
495.711	(Laughter) (Applause)
506.292	And I love calculating these kinds of things,
509.509	and it's not that I love doing the math.
511.224	I do a lot of math,
512.789	but I don't really like math for its own sake.
515.865	What I love is that it lets you take
517.815	some things that you know,
519.215	and just by moving symbols
519.215	around on a piece of paper,
523.993	find out something that you didn't know
525.69	that's very surprising.
527.87	And I have a lot of stupid questions,
529.546	and I love that math gives the power
531.349	to answer them sometimes.
534.106	And sometimes not.
535.633	This is a question I got from a reader,
538.557	an anonymous reader,
539.73	"and the subject line just said, ""Urgent,"""
541.775	and this was the entire email:
543.704	"""If people had wheels and could fly,"
546.466	"how would we differentiate them from airplanes?"""
549.162	Urgent. (Laughter)
551.837	And I think there are some questions
555.19	that math just cannot answer.
557.86	Thank you.
560.331	(Applause)
