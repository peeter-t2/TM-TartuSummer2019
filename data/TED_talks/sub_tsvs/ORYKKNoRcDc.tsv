27	This is a recent comic strip from the Los Angeles Times.
29	The punch line?
31	"""On the other hand, I don't have to get up at four"
33	"every single morning to milk my Labrador."""
35	This is a recent cover of New York Magazine.
38	Best hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment,
41	births, strokes, heart disease, hip replacements, 4 a.m. emergencies.
46	And this is a song medley I put together --
49	(Music)
69	Did you ever notice that four in the morning has become
71	some sort of meme or shorthand?
74	It means something like you are awake at the worst possible hour.
78	(Laughter)
79	A time for inconveniences, mishaps, yearnings.
84	A time for plotting to whack the chief of police,
87	"like in this classic scene from ""The Godfather."""
89	"Coppola's script describes these guys as, ""exhausted in shirt sleeves."
92	"It is four in the morning."""
94	(Laughter)
95	A time for even grimmer stuff than that,
97	like autopsies and embalmings in Isabel Allende's
100	"""The House of the Spirits."""
102	After the breathtaking green-haired Rosa is murdered,
104	the doctors preserve her with unguents and morticians' paste.
107	They worked until four o'clock in the morning.
110	A time for even grimmer stuff than that,
113	like in last April's New Yorker magazine.
116	This short fiction piece by Martin Amis
118	"starts out, ""On September 11, 2001, he opened his eyes"
122	at 4 a.m. in Portland, Maine,
124	"and Mohamed Atta's last day began."""
128	For a time that I find to be the most placid
131	and uneventful hour of the day, four in the morning sure gets
135	an awful lot of bad press --
137	(Laughter)
138	across a lot of different media from a lot of big names.
141	And it made me suspicious.
144	I figured, surely some of the most creative artistic minds in the world, really,
148	aren't all defaulting back to this one easy trope
152	like they invented it, right?
154	Could it be there is something more going on here?
157	Something deliberate, something secret,
160	and who got the four in the morning bad rap ball rolling anyway?
164	I say this guy -- Alberto Giacometti, shown here
168	with some of his sculptures on the Swiss 100 franc note.
171	He did it with this famous piece
173	from the New York Museum of Modern Art.
175	"Its title -- ""The Palace at Four in the Morning --"
178	(Laughter)
183	Not just the earliest cryptic reference
185	to four in the morning I can find.
186	I believe that this so-called first surrealist sculpture
190	may provide an incredible key to virtually
194	every artistic depiction of four in the morning to follow it.
197	I call this The Giacometti Code, a TED exclusive.
201	No, feel free to follow along on your Blackberries
204	or your iPhones if you've got them.
206	It works a little something like -- this is a recent Google search
209	for four in the morning.
211	Results vary, of course. This is pretty typical.
213	The top 10 results yield you
215	"four hits for Faron Young's song, ""It's Four in the Morning,"""
220	"three hits for Judi Dench's film, ""Four in the Morning,"""
224	"one hit for Wislawa Szymborska's poem, ""Four in the Morning."""
228	But what, you may ask, do a Polish poet, a British Dame,
232	a country music hall of famer all have in common
235	besides this totally excellent Google ranking?
238	Well, let's start with Faron Young -- who was born incidentally
243	in 1932.
245	(Laughter)
247	In 1996, he shot himself in the head on December ninth --
253	which incidentally is Judi Dench's birthday.
256	(Laughter)
259	But he didn't die on Dench's birthday.
261	He languished until the following afternoon when he finally succumbed
264	to a supposedly self-inflicted gunshot wound at the age of 64 --
269	which incidentally is how old Alberto Giacometti was when he died.
274	Where was Wislawa Szymborska during all this?
276	She has the world's most absolutely watertight alibi.
280	On that very day, December 10, 1996 while Mr. Four in the Morning,
285	Faron Young, was giving up the ghost in Nashville, Tennessee,
288	Ms. Four in the Morning -- or one of them anyway -- Wislawa Szymborska
292	was in Stockholm, Sweden, accepting the Nobel Prize for Literature.
302	Coincidence? No, it's creepy.
304	(Laughter)
306	Coincidence to me has a much simpler metric.
308	That's like me telling you,
309	"""Hey, you know the Nobel Prize was established in 1901,"
312	"which coincidentally is the same year Alberto Giacometti was born?"""
317	No, not everything fits so tidily into the paradigm,
321	but that does not mean there's not something going on
324	at the highest possible levels.
326	In fact there are people in this room
328	who may not want me to show you this clip we're about to see.
332	(Laughter)
333	Video: Homer Simpson: We have a tennis court, a swimming pool, a screening room --
335	You mean if I want pork chops, even in the middle of the night,
338	your guy will fry them up?
340	Herbert Powell: Sure, that's what he's paid for.
342	Now do you need towels, laundry, maids?
345	HS: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait -- let me see if I got this straight.
348	It is Christmas Day, 4 a.m.
350	There's a rumble in my stomach.
352	Marge Simpson: Homer, please.
354	Rives: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
356	Let me see if I got this straight, Matt.
359	(Laughter)
361	When Homer Simpson needs to imagine
364	the most remote possible moment of not just the clock,
367	but the whole freaking calendar, he comes up with 0400
371	on the birthday of the Baby Jesus.
373	And no, I don't know how it works
376	into the whole puzzling scheme of things, but obviously
380	I know a coded message when I see one.
384	(Laughter)
385	I said, I know a coded message when I see one.
389	"And folks, you can buy a copy of Bill Clinton's ""My Life"""
392	from the bookstore here at TED.
394	Parse it cover to cover for whatever hidden references you want.
397	Or you can go to the Random House website where there is this excerpt.
400	And how far down into it you figure we'll have to scroll
402	to get to the golden ticket?
405	Would you believe about a dozen paragraphs?
408	This is page 474 on your paperbacks if you're following along:
411	"""Though it was getting better, I still wasn't satisfied"
414	with the inaugural address.
416	My speechwriters must have been tearing their hair out
419	because as we worked between one and four in the morning
422	"on Inauguration Day, I was still changing it."""
426	Sure you were, because you've prepared your entire life
429	for this historic quadrennial event that just sort of sneaks up on you.
433	And then --
434	(Laughter)
436	three paragraphs later we get this little beauty:
441	"""We went back to Blair House to look at the speech for the last time."
444	"It had gotten a lot better since 4 a.m."""
447	Well, how could it have?
449	By his own writing, this man was either asleep,
451	at a prayer meeting with Al and Tipper or learning how to launch
454	a nuclear missile out of a suitcase.
457	What happens to American presidents at 0400 on inauguration day?
461	What happened to William Jefferson Clinton?
463	We might not ever know.
465	And I noticed, he's not exactly around here today
468	to face any tough questions.
470	(Laughter)
472	It could get awkward, right?
474	I mean after all, this whole business happened on his watch.
476	But if he were here --
478	(Laughter)
479	he might remind us, as he does in the wrap-up to his fine autobiography,
483	that on this day Bill Clinton began a journey --
486	a journey that saw him go on to become
488	the first Democrat president elected
490	to two consecutive terms in decades.
493	In generations.
495	The first since this man, Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
498	who began his own unprecedented journey
501	way back at his own first election,
504	way back in a simpler time, way back in 1932 --
512	(Laughter)
513	the year Alberto Giacometti
514	(Laughter)
516	"made ""The Palace at Four in the Morning."""
518	The year, let's remember, that this voice, now departed,
522	first came a-cryin' into this big old crazy world of ours.
527	(Music)
551	(Applause)
