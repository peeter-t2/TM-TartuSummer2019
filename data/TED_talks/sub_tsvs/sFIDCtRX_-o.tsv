12.58	This is what my last week looked like.
16.5	What I did,
18.22	who I was with,
20.06	the main sensations I had
20.06	for every waking hour ...
23.9	If the feeling came as I thought of my dad
26.42	who recently passed away,
28.22	or if I could have just definitely
28.22	avoided the worries and anxieties.
32.3	And if you think I'm a little obsessive,
34.26	you're probably right.
36.14	But clearly, from this visualization,
38.42	you can learn much more about me
38.42	than from this other one,
41.74	which are images you're
41.74	probably more familiar with
44.74	and which you possibly even have
44.74	on your phone right now.
47.58	Bar charts for the steps you walked,
49.82	pie charts for the quality
49.82	of your sleep --
52.22	the path of your morning runs.
55.1	In my day job, I work with data.
57.42	I run a data visualization design company,
59.94	and we design and develop ways
59.94	to make information accessible
63.3	through visual representations.
65.42	What my job has taught me over the years
68.46	is that to really understand data
68.46	and their true potential,
72.7	sometimes we actually
72.7	have to forget about them
75.82	and see through them instead.
78.26	Because data are always
78.26	just a tool we use to represent reality.
81.86	They're always used
81.86	as a placeholder for something else,
84.74	but they are never the real thing.
86.94	But let me step back for a moment
88.9	to when I first understood
88.9	this personally.
92.1	In 1994, I was 13 years old.
95.46	I was a teenager in Italy.
97.42	I was too young
97.42	to be interested in politics,
100.06	but I knew that a businessman,
100.06	Silvio Berlusconi,
102.58	was running for president
102.58	for the moderate right.
105.94	We lived in a very liberal town,
107.98	and my father was a politician
107.98	for the Democratic Party.
111.3	And I remember that no one thought
111.3	that Berlusconi could get elected --
115.66	that was totally not an option.
118.38	But it happened.
119.62	And I remember the feeling very vividly.
122.18	It was a complete surprise,
124.06	as my dad promised that in my town
124.06	he knew nobody who voted for him.
130.54	This was the first time
132.06	when the data I had gave me
132.06	a completely distorted image of reality.
137.1	My data sample was actually
137.1	pretty limited and skewed,
140.42	so probably it was because of that,
140.42	I thought, I lived in a bubble,
144.18	and I didn't have enough chances
144.18	to see outside of it.
147.9	Now, fast-forward to November 8, 2016
151.7	in the United States.
153.78	The internet polls,
155.1	statistical models,
156.5	all the pundits agreeing on a possible
156.5	outcome for the presidential election.
161.34	It looked like we had
161.34	enough information this time,
163.98	and many more chances to see outside
163.98	the closed circle we lived in --
168.1	but we clearly didn't.
169.86	The feeling felt very familiar.
171.98	I had been there before.
174.18	I think it's fair to say
174.18	the data failed us this time --
177.06	and pretty spectacularly.
178.94	We believed in data,
180.66	but what happened,
182.1	even with the most respected newspaper,
184.82	is that the obsession to reduce everything
184.82	to two simple percentage numbers
189.54	to make a powerful headline
191.54	made us focus on these two digits
193.62	and them alone.
195.38	In an effort to simplify the message
197.46	and draw a beautiful,
197.46	inevitable red and blue map,
200.9	we lost the point completely.
203.26	We somehow forgot
203.26	that there were stories --
205.42	stories of human beings
205.42	behind these numbers.
209.06	In a different context,
210.66	but to a very similar point,
212.34	a peculiar challenge was presented
212.34	to my team by this woman.
216.26	She came to us with a lot of data,
218.66	but ultimately she wanted to tell
218.66	one of the most humane stories possible.
223.1	She's Samantha Cristoforetti.
224.82	She has been the first
224.82	Italian woman astronaut,
227.42	and she contacted us before being launched
229.94	on a six-month-long expedition
229.94	to the International Space Station.
233.86	"She told us, ""I'm going to space,"
236.1	and I want to do something meaningful
236.1	with the data of my mission
239.22	"to reach out to people."""
241.42	A mission to the
241.42	International Space Station
243.98	comes with terabytes of data
246.1	about anything you can possibly imagine --
248.5	the orbits around Earth,
250.02	the speed and position of the ISS
252.14	and all of the other thousands
252.14	of live streams from its sensors.
256.66	We had all of the hard data
256.66	we could think of --
259.58	just like the pundits
259.58	before the election --
262.02	but what is the point
262.02	of all these numbers?
265.02	People are not interested
265.02	in data for the sake of it,
267.78	because numbers are never the point.
269.659	They're always the means to an end.
272.659	The story we needed to tell
274.46	is that there is a human being
274.46	in a teeny box
276.98	flying in space above your head,
279.26	and that you can actually see her
279.26	with your naked eye on a clear night.
283.38	So we decided to use data
283.38	to create a connection
286.5	between Samantha and all of the people
286.5	looking at her from below.
290.58	We designed and developed
290.58	"what we called ""Friends in Space,"""
293.78	a web application that simply
293.78	"lets you say ""hello"" to Samantha"
298.46	from where you are,
299.74	"and ""hello"" to all the people"
299.74	who are online at the same time
303.3	from all over the world.
305.46	"And all of these ""hellos"""
305.46	left visible marks on the map
308.94	as Samantha was flying by
310.98	and as she was actually
310.98	waving back every day at us
314.38	using Twitter from the ISS.
316.7	This made people see the mission's data
316.7	from a very different perspective.
321.7	It all suddenly became much more
321.7	about our human nature and our curiosity,
326.42	rather than technology.
328.1	So data powered the experience,
330.46	but stories of human beings
330.46	were the drive.
334.66	The very positive response
334.66	of its thousands of users
338.02	taught me a very important lesson --
339.98	that working with data
339.98	means designing ways
342.86	to transform the abstract
342.86	and the uncountable
345.62	into something that can be seen,
345.62	felt and directly reconnected
349.66	to our lives and to our behaviors,
351.98	something that is hard to achieve
353.86	if we let the obsession for the numbers
353.86	and the technology around them
357.78	lead us in the process.
360.42	But we can do even more to connect data
360.42	to the stories they represent.
365.34	We can remove technology completely.
368.02	A few years ago, I met this other woman,
370.3	Stefanie Posavec --
371.7	a London-based designer who shares with me
371.7	the passion and obsession about data.
377.54	We didn't know each other,
378.9	but we decided to run
378.9	a very radical experiment,
382.18	starting a communication using only data,
384.74	no other language,
386.1	and we opted for using no technology
386.1	whatsoever to share our data.
390.74	In fact, our only means of communication
393.66	would be through
393.66	the old-fashioned post office.
396.54	"For ""Dear Data,"" every week for one year,"
399.02	we used our personal data
399.02	to get to know each other --
402.5	personal data around weekly
402.5	shared mundane topics,
406.18	from our feelings
407.42	to the interactions with our partners,
409.3	from the compliments we received
409.3	to the sounds of our surroundings.
413.3	Personal information
413.3	that we would then manually hand draw
416.86	on a postcard-size sheet of paper
419.38	that we would every week
419.38	send from London to New York,
422.34	where I live,
423.62	and from New York to London,
423.62	where she lives.
426.3	The front of the postcard
426.3	is the data drawing,
430.02	and the back of the card
431.34	contains the address
431.34	of the other person, of course,
433.793	and the legend for how
433.793	to interpret our drawing.
437.46	The very first week into the project,
439.5	we actually chose
439.5	a pretty cold and impersonal topic.
442.58	How many times do we
442.58	check the time in a week?
446.54	So here is the front of my card,
448.5	and you can see that every little symbol
450.5	represents all of the times
450.5	that I checked the time,
453.94	positioned for days
453.94	and different hours chronologically --
457.34	nothing really complicated here.
460.02	But then you see in the legend
461.62	how I added anecdotal details
461.62	about these moments.
465.1	In fact, the different types of symbols
465.1	indicate why I was checking the time --
469.7	what was I doing?
470.94	Was I bored? Was I hungry?
472.66	Was I late?
473.9	Did I check it on purpose
473.9	or just casually glance at the clock?
477.14	And this is the key part --
479.42	representing the details
479.42	of my days and my personality
483.14	through my data collection.
485.1	Using data as a lens or a filter
485.1	to discover and reveal, for example,
489.82	my never-ending anxiety for being late,
492.02	even though I'm absolutely always on time.
496.02	Stefanie and I spent one year
496.02	collecting our data manually
500.14	to force us to focus on the nuances
500.14	that computers cannot gather --
504.66	or at least not yet --
506.22	using data also to explore our minds
506.22	and the words we use,
509.74	and not only our activities.
511.7	Like at week number three,
513.14	"where we tracked the ""thank yous"""
513.14	we said and were received,
516.98	and when I realized that I thank
516.98	mostly people that I don't know.
521.66	Apparently I'm a compulsive thanker
521.66	to waitresses and waiters,
526.02	but I definitely don't thank enough
526.02	the people who are close to me.
530.82	Over one year,
532.1	the process of actively noticing
532.1	and counting these types of actions
536.62	became a ritual.
537.94	It actually changed ourselves.
540.02	We became much more
540.02	in tune with ourselves,
542.74	much more aware of our behaviors
542.74	and our surroundings.
546.5	Over one year, Stefanie and I
546.5	connected at a very deep level
549.5	through our shared data diary,
551.54	but we could do this only because
551.54	we put ourselves in these numbers,
555.86	adding the contexts
555.86	of our very personal stories to them.
559.86	It was the only way
559.86	to make them truly meaningful
562.34	and representative of ourselves.
566.3	I am not asking you
566.3	to start drawing your personal data,
569.42	or to find a pen pal across the ocean.
572.3	But I'm asking you to consider data --
574.9	all kind of data --
576.38	as the beginning of the conversation
578.18	and not the end.
579.9	Because data alone
579.9	will never give us a solution.
583.1	And this is why data failed us so badly --
585.82	because we failed to include
585.82	the right amount of context
589.22	to represent reality --
590.7	a nuanced, complicated
590.7	and intricate reality.
594.78	We kept looking at these two numbers,
597.26	obsessing with them
598.78	and pretending that our world
598.78	could be reduced
601.3	to a couple digits and a horse race,
603.66	while the real stories,
604.94	the ones that really mattered,
606.42	were somewhere else.
607.86	What we missed looking at these stories
607.86	only through models and algorithms
612.3	"is what I call ""data humanism."""
615.38	In the Renaissance humanism,
617.42	European intellectuals
619.06	placed the human nature instead of God
619.06	at the center of their view of the world.
624.62	I believe something similar
624.62	needs to happen
626.86	with the universe of data.
628.66	Now data are apparently
628.66	treated like a God --
631.66	keeper of infallible truth
631.66	for our present and our future.
635.66	The experiences
635.66	that I shared with you today
638.58	taught me that to make data faithfully
638.58	representative of our human nature
643.62	and to make sure they will not
643.62	mislead us anymore,
647.06	we need to start designing ways
647.06	to include empathy, imperfection
650.78	and human qualities
652.38	in how we collect, process,
652.38	analyze and display them.
657.1	I do see a place where, ultimately,
660.1	instead of using data
660.1	only to become more efficient,
663.46	we will all use data
663.46	to become more humane.
666.7	Thank you.
667.94	(Applause)
