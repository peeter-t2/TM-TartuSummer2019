15.941	I'm here today to talk about a disturbing question,
19.229	which has an equally disturbing answer.
22.927	My topic is the secrets of domestic violence,
26.529	and the question I'm going to tackle
28.863	is the one question everyone always asks:
32.944	Why does she stay?
34.556	Why would anyone stay with a man who beats her?
38.552	I'm not a psychiatrist, a social worker
41.529	or an expert in domestic violence.
43.864	I'm just one woman with a story to tell.
47.063	I was 22. I had just graduated from Harvard College.
51.576	I had moved to New York City for my first job
54.048	as a writer and editor at Seventeen magazine.
57.344	I had my first apartment,
59.584	my first little green American Express card,
62.784	and I had a very big secret.
65.812	My secret was that I had this gun
69.511	loaded with hollow-point bullets pointed at my head
72.949	by the man who I thought was my soulmate,
75.512	many, many times.
78.997	The man who I loved more than anybody on Earth
82.557	held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me
86.636	more times than I can even remember.
89.821	I'm here to tell you the story of crazy love,
92.564	a psychological trap disguised as love,
95.748	one that millions of women and even a few men
98.6	fall into every year.
100.981	It may even be your story.
103.73	I don't look like a typical domestic violence survivor.
106.773	I have a B.A. in English from Harvard College,
109.079	an MBA in marketing from Wharton Business School.
111.441	I've spent most of my career working for Fortune 500 companies
114.733	including Johnson &amp; Johnson, Leo Burnett and The Washington Post.
119.005	I've been married for almost 20 years to my second husband
122.801	and we have three kids together.
125.59	My dog is a black lab, and I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan.
129.819	(Laughter)
132.299	So my first message for you is that domestic violence
135.018	happens to everyone --
137.386	all races, all religions, all income and education levels.
141.562	It's everywhere.
143.501	And my second message is that everyone thinks
146.021	domestic violence happens to women,
148.139	that it's a women's issue.
150.407	Not exactly.
152.626	Over 85 percent of abusers are men, and domestic abuse
156.738	happens only in intimate, interdependent, long-term relationships,
162.656	in other words, in families,
164.825	the last place we would want or expect to find violence,
168.69	which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing.
172.968	I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth
176.519	who would stay with a man who beats me,
179.091	but in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age.
182.498	I was 22, and in the United States,
185.783	women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely
189.632	to be domestic violence victims
192.393	as women of other ages,
195.208	and over 500 women and girls this age
198.511	are killed every year by abusive partners,
202.082	boyfriends, and husbands in the United States.
206.715	I was also a very typical victim because I knew nothing
209.775	about domestic violence, its warning signs or its patterns.
214.36	I met Conor on a cold, rainy January night.
219.425	He sat next to me on the New York City subway,
222.388	and he started chatting me up.
224.527	He told me two things.
226.395	One was that he, too, had just graduated from an Ivy League school,
230.197	and that he worked at a very impressive Wall Street bank.
234.552	But what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting
238.212	was that he was smart and funny
241.5	and he looked like a farm boy.
242.9	He had these big cheeks, these big apple cheeks
245.247	and this wheat-blond hair,
246.932	and he seemed so sweet.
250.219	One of the smartest things Conor did, from the very beginning,
254.003	was to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship.
259.577	He did this especially at the beginning
261.778	by idolizing me.
264.644	We started dating, and he loved everything about me,
267.93	that I was smart, that I'd gone to Harvard,
269.614	that I was passionate about helping teenage girls, and my job.
272.644	He wanted to know everything about my family
275.175	and my childhood and my hopes and dreams.
277.791	Conor believed in me, as a writer and a woman,
281.425	in a way that no one else ever had.
285.104	And he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us
289.429	by confessing his secret,
291.949	which was that, as a very young boy starting at age four,
296.429	he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused
299.34	by his stepfather,
301.026	and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade,
304.966	even though he was very smart,
307.585	and he'd spent almost 20 years rebuilding his life.
310.841	Which is why that Ivy League degree
313.997	and the Wall Street job and his bright shiny future
316.81	meant so much to him.
319.381	If you had told me
321.525	that this smart, funny, sensitive man who adored me
326.889	would one day dictate whether or not I wore makeup,
331.272	how short my skirts were,
333.322	where I lived, what jobs I took,
335.252	who my friends were and where I spent Christmas,
338.616	I would have laughed at you,
340.564	because there was not a hint of violence or control
343.612	or anger in Conor at the beginning.
347.096	I didn't know that the first stage
350.221	in any domestic violence relationship
352.596	is to seduce and charm the victim.
356.248	I also didn't know that the second step is to isolate the victim.
361.008	Now, Conor did not come home one day and announce,
365.162	"""You know, hey, all this Romeo and Juliet stuff has been great,"
368.296	but I need to move into the next phase
370.301	"where I isolate you and I abuse you"" — (Laughter) —"
374.48	"""so I need to get you out of this apartment"
375.835	where the neighbors can hear you scream
377.476	and out of this city where you have friends and family
379.949	"and coworkers who can see the bruises."""
383.255	Instead, Conor came home one Friday evening
387.476	and he told me that he had quit his job that day,
390.207	his dream job,
392.672	and he said that he had quit his job because of me,
396.813	because I had made him feel so safe and loved
399.991	that he didn't need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore,
403.114	and he just wanted to get out of the city
405.629	and away from his abusive, dysfunctional family,
408.607	and move to a tiny town in New England
411.729	where he could start his life over with me by his side.
415.302	Now, the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York,
419.168	and my dream job,
422.775	but I thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate,
425.358	so I agreed, and I quit my job,
428.822	and Conor and I left Manhattan together.
431.453	I had no idea I was falling into crazy love,
435.819	that I was walking headfirst into a carefully laid
439.451	physical, financial and psychological trap.
444.431	The next step in the domestic violence pattern
446.751	is to introduce the threat of violence
451.033	and see how she reacts.
453.232	And here's where those guns come in.
455.941	As soon as we moved to New England -- you know,
458.859	that place where Connor was supposed to feel so safe --
461.597	he bought three guns.
464.013	He kept one in the glove compartment of our car.
467.453	He kept one under the pillows on our bed,
470.109	and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times.
473.271	And he said that he needed those guns
475.589	because of the trauma he'd experienced as a young boy.
478.385	He needed them to feel protected.
480.869	But those guns were really a message for me,
483.781	and even though he hadn't raised a hand to me,
486.475	my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day.
492.281	Conor first physically attacked me
495.854	five days before our wedding.
498.679	It was 7 a.m. I still had on my nightgown.
502.871	I was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment,
507.111	and I got frustrated,
508.925	and Conor used my anger as an excuse
512.012	to put both of his hands around my neck
515.163	and to squeeze so tightly that I could not breathe or scream,
518.983	and he used the chokehold
520.807	to hit my head repeatedly against the wall.
525.233	Five days later, the ten bruises on my neck had just faded,
530.551	and I put on my mother's wedding dress,
533.026	and I married him.
535.343	Despite what had happened,
537.624	I was sure we were going to live happily ever after,
541.143	because I loved him, and he loved me so much.
545.224	And he was very, very sorry.
548.596	He had just been really stressed out by the wedding
551.769	and by becoming a family with me.
553.966	It was an isolated incident,
555.687	and he was never going to hurt me again.
559.283	It happened twice more on the honeymoon.
561.863	The first time, I was driving to find a secret beach
564.95	and I got lost,
567.652	and he punched me in the side of my head so hard
570.622	that the other side of my head repeatedly hit
572.766	the driver's side window.
575.173	And then a few days later, driving home from our honeymoon,
578.539	he got frustrated by traffic,
580.822	and he threw a cold Big Mac in my face.
584.254	Conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week
586.862	for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
590.279	I was mistaken in thinking that I was unique
593.404	and alone in this situation.
596.047	One in three American women
598.238	experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life,
602.39	and the CDC reports that 15 million children
606.031	are abused every year, 15 million.
609.441	So actually, I was in very good company.
613.814	Back to my question:
616.23	Why did I stay?
618.725	The answer is easy.
621.463	I didn't know he was abusing me.
624.151	Even though he held those loaded guns to my head,
627.999	pushed me down stairs,
630.222	threatened to kill our dog,
631.603	pulled the key out of the car ignition as I drove down the highway,
635.526	poured coffee grinds on my head
638.043	as I dressed for a job interview,
640.359	I never once thought of myself as a battered wife.
644.729	Instead, I was a very strong woman
648.306	in love with a deeply troubled man,
650.558	and I was the only person on Earth
652.615	who could help Conor face his demons.
656.055	The other question everybody asks is,
659.766	why doesn't she just leave?
662.183	Why didn't I walk out? I could have left any time.
666.134	To me, this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask,
670.846	because we victims know something you usually don't:
673.937	It's incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser.
678.33	Because the final step in the domestic violence pattern
681.649	is kill her.
684.544	Over 70 percent of domestic violence murders
687.085	happen after the victim has ended the relationship,
691.153	after she's gotten out,
693.046	because then the abuser has nothing left to lose.
696.297	Other outcomes include long-term stalking,
699.388	even after the abuser remarries;
702.34	denial of financial resources;
704.495	and manipulation of the family court system
706.884	to terrify the victim and her children,
709.707	who are regularly forced by family court judges
714.633	to spend unsupervised time
716.602	with the man who beat their mother.
720.273	And still we ask, why doesn't she just leave?
724.448	I was able to leave,
726.202	because of one final, sadistic beating
729.104	that broke through my denial.
732.263	I realized that the man who I loved so much
735.433	was going to kill me if I let him.
738.343	So I broke the silence.
740.858	I told everyone:
743.688	the police, my neighbors,
747.473	my friends and family, total strangers,
751.313	and I'm here today because you all helped me.
758.167	We tend to stereotype victims
760.705	as grisly headlines,
763.767	self-destructive women, damaged goods.
767.063	"The question, ""Why does she stay?"""
770.066	"is code for some people for, ""It's her fault for staying,"""
775.702	as if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men
779.026	intent upon destroying us.
781.658	"But since publishing ""Crazy Love,"""
784.162	I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women
787.685	who also got out,
790.13	who learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened,
794.51	and who rebuilt lives -- joyous, happy lives --
798.723	as employees, wives and mothers,
801.057	lives completely free of violence, like me.
805.738	Because it turns out that I'm actually a very typical domestic violence victim
809.769	and a typical domestic violence survivor.
813.213	I remarried a kind and gentle man,
817.238	and we have those three kids.
819.574	I have that black lab, and I have that minivan.
822.975	What I will never have again,
826.441	ever,
829.399	is a loaded gun held to my head
831.524	by someone who says that he loves me.
835.167	Right now, maybe you're thinking,
837.798	"""Wow, this is fascinating,"""
839.705	"or, ""Wow, how stupid was she,"""
842.833	but this whole time, I've actually been talking about you.
848.836	I promise you there are several people
852.353	listening to me right now
854.095	who are currently being abused
857.107	or who were abused as children
859.622	or who are abusers themselves.
862.992	Abuse could be affecting your daughter,
864.929	your sister, your best friend right now.
870.222	I was able to end my own crazy love story
873.666	by breaking the silence.
875.867	I'm still breaking the silence today.
878.382	It's my way of helping other victims,
882.198	and it's my final request of you.
885.566	Talk about what you heard here.
888.398	Abuse thrives only in silence.
891.726	You have the power to end domestic violence
895.429	simply by shining a spotlight on it.
898.938	We victims need everyone.
902.012	We need every one of you to understand
906.085	the secrets of domestic violence.
909.863	Show abuse the light of day by talking about it
912.847	with your children, your coworkers,
914.974	your friends and family.
916.911	Recast survivors as wonderful, lovable people
920.357	with full futures.
923.172	Recognize the early signs of violence
926.653	and conscientiously intervene,
929.486	deescalate it, show victims a safe way out.
933.648	Together we can make our beds,
937.643	our dinner tables and our families
941.26	the safe and peaceful oases they should be.
944.517	Thank you.
946.489	(Applause)
