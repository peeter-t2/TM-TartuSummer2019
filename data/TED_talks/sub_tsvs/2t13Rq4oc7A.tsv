12.76	In 1962 at Rice University,
16.76	JFK told the country about a dream he had,
21.2	a dream to put a person on the moon
21.2	by the end of the decade.
25.12	The eponymous moonshot.
28.12	No one knew if it was possible to do
30.72	but he made sure a plan was put in place
30.72	to do it if it was possible.
35.56	That's how great dreams are.
37.36	Great dreams aren't just visions,
39.84	they're visions coupled to strategies
39.84	for making them real.
44.08	I have the incredible good fortune
44.08	to work at a moonshot factory.
49.52	At X -- formerly called Google X --
51.84	you'll find an aerospace engineer
51.84	working alongside a fashion designer
56.56	and former military ops commanders
56.56	brainstorming with laser experts.
62.36	These inventors, engineers and makers
62.36	are dreaming up technologies
67.56	that we hope can make the world
67.56	a wonderful place.
72.2	"We use the word ""moonshots"""
72.2	to remind us to keep our visions big --
76.76	to keep dreaming.
78.48	"And we use the word ""factory"""
78.48	to remind ourselves
82.96	that we want to have concrete visions --
86.08	concrete plans to make them real.
89.4	Here's our moonshot blueprint.
91.36	Number one:
92.6	we want to find
92.6	a huge problem in the world
95.04	that affects many millions of people.
97.32	Number two:
98.84	we want to find or propose a radical
98.84	solution for solving that problem.
103.48	And then number three:
104.88	there has to be some reason to believe
107.88	that the technology
107.88	for such a radical solution
110.96	could actually be built.
113.88	But I have a secret for you.
115.52	The moonshot factory is a messy place.
119.6	But rather than avoid the mess,
121.44	pretend it's not there,
123	we've tried to make that our strength.
126.08	We spend most of our time breaking things
128.92	and trying to prove that we're wrong.
132.32	That's it, that's the secret.
134.68	Run at all the hardest
134.68	parts of the problem first.
138.24	Get excited and cheer,
140.32	"""Hey! How are we going"
140.32	"to kill our project today?"""
145.92	We've got this interesting balance going
149.56	where we allow our unchecked
149.56	optimism to fuel our visions.
155.12	But then we also harness
155.12	enthusiastic skepticism
159.6	to breathe life, breathe reality
159.6	into those visions.
163.32	I want to show you a few of the projects
165.28	that we've had to leave behind
165.28	on the cutting room floor,
168	and also a few of the gems
169.6	that at least so far,
169.6	have not only survived that process,
173.32	but have been accelerated by it.
176.76	Last year we killed a project
176.76	in automated vertical farming.
181.2	This is some of the lettuce that we grew.
183.24	One in nine people in the world
183.24	suffers from undernourishment.
186.84	So this is a moonshot
186.84	that needs to happen.
189.96	Vertical farming uses 10 times less water
192.64	and a hundred times less land
192.64	than conventional farming.
196.8	And because you can grow the food
196.8	close to where it's consumed,
202.2	you don't have to
202.2	transport it large distances.
207.16	We made progress in a lot of the areas
209.48	like automated harvesting
209.48	and efficient lighting.
213.12	But unfortunately,
214.6	we couldn't get staple crops
214.6	like grains and rice to grow this way.
218.68	So we killed the project.
221.12	Here's another huge problem.
223.24	We pay enormous costs in resources
223.24	and environmental damage
228.44	to ship goods worldwide.
230.68	Economic development
230.68	of landlocked countries
233.28	is limited by lack
233.28	of shipping infrastructure.
236.88	The radical solution?
238.52	A lighter-than-air,
238.52	variable-buoyancy cargo ship.
244.24	This has the potential to lower,
247.64	at least overall,
249.28	the cost, time and carbon
249.28	footprint of shipping
253.84	without needing runways.
255.88	We came up with this clever set
255.88	of technical breakthroughs
258.96	that together might make it possible
258.96	for us to lower the cost enough
263.92	that we could actually make these ships --
266.08	inexpensively enough in volume.
268.76	But however cheap they would
268.76	have been to make in volume
273.32	it turned out that it was going to cost
273.32	close to 200 million dollars
277.2	to design and build the first one.
	is just way too expensive.
284.36	Because X is structured
284.36	with these tight feedback loops
288.2	of making mistakes
288.2	and learning and new designs,
291.88	we can't spend 200 million dollars
293.64	to get the first data point
295.4	about whether we're
295.4	on the right track or not.
298.6	If there's an Achilles' heel
298.6	in one our projects,
300.96	we want to know it now, up front,
300.96	not way down the road.
305.28	So we killed this project, too.
308.88	Discovering a major flaw in a project
311.64	doesn't always mean
311.64	that it ends the project.
313.8	Sometimes it actually gets us
313.8	onto a more productive path.
317	This is our fully self-driving
317	vehicle prototype,
320.96	which we built without
320.96	a steering wheel or break pedal.
324.8	But that wasn't actually
324.8	our goal when we started.
327.76	With 1.2 million people dying
327.76	on the roads globally every year,
333.68	building a car that drives itself
333.68	was a natural moonshot to take.
337.52	Three and a half years ago,
339.92	when we had these Lexus,
339.92	retrofitted, self-driving cars in testing,
345.52	they were doing so well,
345.52	we gave them out to other Googlers
349.2	to find out what they thought
349.2	of the experience.
352	And what we discovered
353.28	was that our plan to have the cars
353.28	do almost all the driving
357.92	and just hand over to the users
357.92	in case of emergency
361.84	was a really bad plan.
366.2	It wasn't safe
367.88	because the users didn't do their job.
371.04	They didn't stay alert
373.16	in case the car needed
373.16	to hand control back to them.
377.24	This was a major crisis for the team.
379.28	It sent them back to the drawing board.
382.32	And they came up
382.32	with a beautiful, new perspective.
386.6	Aim for a car where
386.6	you're truly a passenger.
391.28	You tell the car where you want to go,
393.56	you push a button
394.84	and it takes you
394.84	from point A to point B by itself.
399.72	We're really grateful
401.04	that we had this insight
401.04	as early on in the project as we did.
404.6	And it's shaped everything
404.6	we've done since then.
409.2	And now our cars have self-driven
409.2	more than 1.4 million miles,
415.56	and they're out everyday
417.2	on the streets of Mountain View,
417.2	California and Austin, Texas.
422.12	The cars team shifted their perspective.
426	This is one of X's mantras.
428.08	Sometimes shifting your perspective
428.08	is more powerful than being smart.
433.88	Take wind energy.
435.4	It's one of my favorite examples
435.4	of perspective shifting.
438.76	There's no way that we're going to build
441.64	a better standard wind turbine
441.64	than the experts in that industry.
446.72	But we found a way
446.72	to get up higher into the sky,
451.64	and so get access to faster,
451.64	more consistent winds,
455.48	and so more energy without needing
455.48	hundreds of tons of steel to get there.
461.16	Our Makani energy kite
461.16	rises up from its perch
464.52	by spinning up those
464.52	propellers along its wing.
467.56	And it pulls out a tether as it rises,
470.64	pulling energy up through the tether.
472.56	Once the tether's all the way out,
474.44	it goes into crosswind circles in the sky.
478.32	And now those propellers that lifted it up
478.32	have become flying turbines.
484.4	And that sends energy
484.4	back down the tether.
487.88	We haven't yet found
487.88	a way to kill this project.
490.76	And the longer it survives that pressure,
490.76	the more excited we get
494.88	that this could become
494.88	a cheaper and more deployable form
499.36	of wind energy for the world.
503.08	Probably the craziest sounding project
503.08	we have is Project Loon.
507.32	We're trying to make
507.32	balloon-powered Internet.
510.88	A network of balloons in the stratosphere
514.8	that beam an internet connection down
514.8	to rural and remote areas of the world.
519.92	This could bring online
519.92	as many as four billion more people,
523.84	who today have little
523.84	or no internet connection.
527.12	But you can't just take a cell tower,
530.039	strap it to a balloon
530.039	and stick it in the sky.
532.96	The winds are too strong,
532.96	it would be blown away.
535.36	And the balloons are too high up
535.36	to tie it to the ground.
540.8	Here comes the crazy moment.
543	What if, instead,
545.12	we let the balloons drift
547.36	and we taught them how to sail the winds
547.36	to go where the needed to go?
553.56	It turns out the stratosphere has winds
556.92	that are going in quite different
556.92	speeds and directions in thin strata.
561.04	So we hoped that using smart algorithms
561.04	and wind data from around the world,
566.8	we could maneuver the balloons a bit,
569.28	getting them to go up and down
569.28	just a tiny bit in the stratosphere
572.4	to grab those winds going
572.4	in those different directions and speeds.
576.04	The idea is to have enough balloons
578.36	so as one balloon floats out of your area,
581.24	there's another balloon
581.24	ready to float into place,
585	handing off the internet connection,
587.64	just like your phone
587.64	hands off between cell towers
591.12	as you drive down the freeway.
593.76	We get how crazy that vision sounds --
598.2	there's the name of the project
598.2	to remind us of that.
600.96	So since 2012,
603.32	the Loon team has prioritized
603.32	the work that seems the most difficult
609.12	and so the most likely
609.12	to kill their project.
613.92	The first thing that they did
615.48	was try to get a Wi-Fi connection
615.48	from a balloon in the stratosphere
619.72	down to an antenna on the ground.
622.72	It worked.
623.96	And I promise you there were bets
623.96	that it wasn't going to.
626.699	So we kept going.
628.88	Could we get the balloon
628.88	to talk directly to handsets,
632.28	so that we didn't need the antenna
632.28	as an intermediary receiver?
636.72	Yeah.
638.68	Could we get the balloon
638.68	bandwidth high enough
641.32	so it was a real Internet connection?
644.08	So that people could have
644.08	something more than just SMS?
649.64	The early tests weren't even
649.64	a megabit per second,
653.48	but now we can do
653.48	up to 15 megabits per second.
656.92	Enough to watch a TED Talk.
659.36	Could we get the balloons
659.36	to talk to each other through the sky
662.96	so that we could reach our signal
662.96	deeper into rural areas?
667.84	Check.
669.4	Could we get balloons the size of a house
669.4	to stay up for more than 100 days,
676.08	while costing less than five percent
678.4	of what traditional, long-life
678.4	balloons have cost to make?
683.64	Yes. In the end.
685.56	But I promise you, you name it,
685.56	we had to try it to get there.
691.48	We made round, silvery balloons.
695.2	We made giant pillow-shaped balloons.
700.4	We made balloons the size of a blue whale.
704.44	We busted a lot of balloons.
707.4	(Laughter)
709.04	Since one of the things that was
709.04	most likely to kill the Loon project
713.12	was whether we could guide
713.12	the balloons through the sky,
716.2	one of our most important experiments
716.2	was putting a balloon inside a balloon.
722.28	So there are two compartments here,
722.28	one with air and then one with helium.
727.36	The balloon pumps air in
727.36	to make itself heavier,
731.24	or lets air out to make it lighter.
734.52	And these weight changes
734.52	allow it to rise or fall,
737.84	and that simple movement of the balloon
737.84	is its steering mechanism.
741.6	It floats up or down,
743.28	hoping to grab winds going in the speed
743.28	and direction that it wants.
747.92	But is that good enough
747.92	for it to navigate through the world?
752.8	Barely at first,
755.36	but better all the time.
756.76	This particular balloon,
756.76	our latest balloon,
759.68	can navigate a two-mile
759.68	vertical stretch of sky
764.28	and can sail itself to within 500 meters
764.28	of where it wants to go
768.36	from 20,000 kilometers away.
776.36	We have lots more to do
778.6	in terms of fine-tuning
778.6	the system and reducing costs.
783.2	But last year,
783.2	a balloon built inexpensively
786.24	went around the world
792.4	So we're going to keep going.
795.12	(Applause)
801.52	Our balloons today
802.8	are doing pretty much everything
802.8	a complete system needs to do.
807.16	We're in discussions
807.16	with telcos around the world,
810.04	and we're going to fly
810.04	over places like Indonesia
812.4	for real service testing this year.
815.16	This probably all sounds
815.16	too good to be true,
818.8	and you're right.
821.32	Being audacious
823.08	and working on big, risky things
825.76	makes people inherently uncomfortable.
829.04	You cannot yell at people
829.04	and force them to fail fast.
835.44	People resist. They worry.
837.56	"""What will happen to me if I fail?"
840.64	Will people laugh at me?
842.88	"Will I be fired?"""
845.88	I started with our secret.
848.6	I'm going to leave you
848.6	with how we actually make it happen.
852.92	The only way to get people
852.92	to work on big, risky things --
857.96	audacious ideas --
859.72	and have them run at all
859.72	the hardest parts of the problem first,
864.68	is if you make that the path
864.68	of least resistance for them.
869.36	We work hard at X to make it safe to fail.
874	Teams kill their ideas
874	as soon as the evidence is on the table
877.96	because they're rewarded for it.
881.16	They get applause from their peers.
884	Hugs and high fives
884	from their manager, me in particular.
889.16	They get promoted for it.
891.68	We have bonused every single person
891.68	on teams that ended their projects,
897.96	from teams as small as two
897.96	to teams of more than 30.
901	We believe in dreams
901	at the moonshot factory.
904.84	But enthusiastic skepticism
907.36	is not the enemy of boundless optimism.
910.84	It's optimism's perfect partner.
914.28	It unlocks the potential in every idea.
919.72	We can create the future
919.72	that's in our dreams.
924.4	Thank you very much.
925.72	(Applause)
