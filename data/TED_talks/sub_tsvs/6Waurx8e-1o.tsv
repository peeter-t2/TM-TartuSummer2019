16.188	I decided when I was asked to do this
18.069	that what I really wanted to talk about
18.069	was my friend, Richard Feynman.
21.791	I was one of the fortunate few
21.791	that really did get to know him
25.26	and enjoyed his presence.
27.26	And I'm going to tell you
27.26	about the Richard Feynman that I knew.
30.787	I'm sure there are people here
30.787	who could tell you
33.11	about the Richard Feynman they knew,
34.851	and it would probably be
34.851	a different Richard Feynman.
37.4	Richard Feynman was a very complex man.
39.407	He was a man of many, many parts.
41.724	He was, of course, foremost,
41.724	a very, very, very great scientist.
47.058	He was an actor. You saw him act.
49.26	I also had the good fortune
49.26	to be in those lectures,
52.942	up in the balcony.
54.796	They were fantastic.
57.145	He was a philosopher.
58.891	He was a drum player.
60.085	He was a teacher par excellence.
63.743	Richard Feynman was also a showman,
66.424	an enormous showman.
68.011	He was brash, irreverent.
71.446	He was full of macho,
71.446	a kind of macho one-upmanship.
76.715	He loved intellectual battle.
80.665	He had a gargantuan ego.
84.417	But the man had, somehow,
87.917	a lot of room at the bottom.
90.393	And what I mean by that
90.393	is a lot of room, in my case --
95.147	I can't speak for anybody else,
95.147	but in my case --
98.26	a lot of room for another big ego.
101.563	Well, not as big as his,
102.977	but fairly big.
106.15	I always felt good with Dick Feynman.
108.396	It was always fun to be with him.
110.846	He always made me feel smart.
113.013	How can somebody like that
113.013	make you feel smart?
115.244	Somehow he did.
116.434	He made me feel smart.
116.434	He made me feel he was smart.
118.918	He made me feel we were both smart,
120.893	and the two of us could solve
120.893	any problem whatever.
125.343	And in fact, we did sometimes
125.343	do physics together.
128.375	We never published a paper together,
130.444	but we did have a lot of fun.
134.02	He loved to win,
135.939	win these little macho games
135.939	we would sometimes play.
138.663	And he didn't only play them with me,
138.663	but with all sorts of people.
141.951	He would almost always win.
143.812	But when he didn't win, when he lost,
146.899	he would laugh and seem
146.899	to have just as much fun
149.56	as if he had won.
151.591	I remember once he told me a story
153.763	about a joke the students played on him.
156.152	I think it was for his birthday --
158.713	they took him for lunch
160.154	to a sandwich place in Pasadena.
164.796	It may still exist; I don't know.
166.844	Celebrity sandwiches was their thing.
169.45	You could get a Marilyn Monroe sandwich.
171.814	You could get a Humphrey Bogart sandwich.
174.633	The students went there in advance,
176.839	and arranged that they'd all order
176.839	Feynman sandwiches.
180.261	One after another, they came in
180.261	and ordered Feynman sandwiches.
183.272	Feynman loved this story.
184.524	He told me this story,
184.524	and he was really happy and laughing.
188.582	When he finished the story, I said to him,
191.356	"""Dick, I wonder what"
191.356	would be the difference
194.243	between a Feynman sandwich
194.243	"and a Susskind sandwich."""
197.751	And without skipping a beat at all,
199.79	"he said, ""Well, they'd be about the same."
203.056	The only difference is a Susskind
203.056	"sandwich would have a lot more ham."""
206.402	"""Ham"" as in bad actor."
208.111	(Laughter)
209.659	Well, I happened to have been
209.659	very quick that day,
213.093	"and I said, ""Yeah,"
213.093	"but a lot less baloney."""
215.26	(Laughter)
218.238	(Applause)
219.399	The truth of the matter
222.605	is that a Feynman sandwich
222.605	had a load of ham,
226.611	but absolutely no baloney.
230.905	What Feynman hated worse
230.905	than anything else
233.202	was intellectual pretense --
235.228	phoniness,
236.481	false sophistication, jargon.
240.21	I remember sometime during the mid-'80s,
244.502	Dick and I and Sidney Coleman
244.502	would meet a couple of times
248.66	up in San Francisco --
248.66	at some very rich guy's house --
251.849	up in San Francisco for dinner.
254	And the last time the rich guy invited us,
256.26	he also invited a couple of philosophers.
258.42	These guys were philosophers of mind.
260.972	Their specialty was the philosophy
260.972	of consciousness.
264.36	And they were full of all kinds of jargon.
267.074	I'm trying to remember the words --
269.494	"""monism,"" ""dualism,"""
269.494	categories all over the place.
273.408	I didn't know what those meant, neither
273.408	did Dick or Sydney, for that matter.
277.006	And what did we talk about?
278.8	Well, what do you talk about
278.8	when you talk about minds?
281.399	There's one obvious thing to talk about:
283.587	Can a machine become a mind?
285.838	Can you build a machine
287.591	that thinks like a human being
287.591	that is conscious?
291.101	We sat around and talked about this --
291.101	we of course never resolved it.
294.455	But the trouble with the philosophers
296.26	is that they were philosophizing
298.26	when they should have been
298.26	science-ophizing.
301.048	It's a scientific question, after all.
303.412	And this was a very, very
303.412	dangerous thing to do
306.343	around Dick Feynman.
307.796	(Laughter)
310.538	Feynman let them have it --
310.538	both barrels, right between the eyes.
313.757	It was brutal; it was funny --
313.757	ooh, it was funny.
316.852	But it was really brutal.
318.589	He really popped their balloon.
321.325	But the amazing thing was --
321.325	Feynman had to leave a little early;
324.849	he wasn't feeling too well,
324.849	so he left a little bit early.
327.975	And Sidney and I were left there
327.975	with the two philosophers.
330.893	And the amazing thing
330.893	is these guys were flying.
333.907	They were so happy.
336.088	They had met the great man;
338.366	they had been instructed by the great man;
340.818	they had an enormous amount of fun
342.783	having their faces shoved in the mud ...
346.135	And it was something special.
348.618	I realized there was something
348.618	just extraordinary about Feynman,
352.031	even when he did what he did.
358.674	Dick -- he was my friend;
358.674	I did call him Dick --
361.372	Dick and I had a little bit of a rapport.
364.082	I think it may have been a special
364.082	rapport that he and I had.
366.98	We liked each other;
366.98	we liked the same kind of things.
369.627	I also like the intellectual macho games.
373.538	Sometimes I would win,
373.538	mostly he would win,
375.642	but we both enjoyed them.
377.26	And Dick became convinced at some point
379.674	that he and I had
379.674	some kind of similarity of personality.
384.486	I don't think he was right.
385.964	I think the only point
385.964	of similarity between us
388.207	is we both like to talk about ourselves.
390.429	But he was convinced of this.
393.294	And the man was incredibly curious.
396.372	And he wanted to understand
396.372	what it was and why it was
400.07	that there was this funny connection.
403.634	And one day, we were walking.
405.342	We were in France, in Les Houches.
407.192	We were up in the mountains, 1976.
410.84	"And Feynman said to me, ""Leonardo ..."""
415.122	"The reason he called me ""Leonardo"""
415.122	is because we were in Europe,
418.181	and he was practicing his French.
419.856	(Laughter)
422	"And he said, ""Leonardo,"
425.247	were you closer to your mother
425.247	"or your father when you were a kid?"""
429.26	"I said, ""Well, my real hero was my father."
433.317	He was a working man,
435.492	had a fifth-grade education.
437.635	He was a master mechanic,
437.635	and he taught me how to use tools.
440.483	He taught me all sorts of things
440.483	about mechanical things.
444.475	He even taught me the Pythagorean theorem.
446.53	He didn't call it the hypotenuse,
448.507	"he called it the shortcut distance."""
451.115	And Feynman's eyes just opened up.
453.916	He went off like a lightbulb.
456.271	And he said that he had had
458.376	basically exactly the same
458.376	relationship with his father.
462.13	In fact, he had been convinced at one time
465.574	that to be a good physicist,
469.409	it was very important to have had
469.409	that kind of relationship
472.766	with your father.
473.946	I apologize for the sexist
473.946	conversation here,
476.976	but this is the way it really happened.
478.86	He said he had been absolutely
478.86	convinced that this was necessary,
482.681	a necessary part of the growing up
482.681	of a young physicist.
486.915	Being Dick, he, of course,
486.915	wanted to check this.
490.072	He wanted to go out and do an experiment.
492.372	(Laughter)
493.412	Well, he did.
494.588	He went out and did an experiment.
496.27	He asked all his friends
496.27	that he thought were good physicists,
499.209	"""Was it your mom or your pop"
499.209	"that influenced you?"""
501.578	They were all men,
503.565	and to a man, every single
503.565	one of them said,
506.219	"""My mother."""
507.467	(Laughter)
510.558	There went that theory,
510.558	down the trash can of history.
514.582	(Laughter)
515.71	But he was very excited
515.71	that he had finally met somebody
518.536	who had the same experience
518.536	with his father
522.156	as he had with his father.
523.615	And for some time, he was convinced
523.615	this was the reason we got along so well.
527.764	I don't know. Maybe. Who knows?
529.86	But let me tell you a little bit
529.86	about Feynman the physicist.
535.882	Feynman's style --
535.882	"no, ""style"" is not the right word."
539.86	"""Style"" makes you think"
539.86	of the bow tie he might have worn,
542.729	or the suit he was wearing.
544.054	It's something much deeper than that,
545.997	but I can't think of another word for it.
548.092	Feynman's scientific style
548.092	was always to look for the simplest,
553.558	most elementary solution
553.558	to a problem that was possible.
557.497	If it wasn't possible,
557.497	you had to use something fancier.
561.729	No doubt, part of this
561.729	was his great joy and pleasure
566.325	in showing people that he could
566.325	think more simply than they could.
570.097	But he also deeply believed,
570.097	he truly believed,
573.28	that if you couldn't explain
573.28	something simply,
575.544	you didn't understand it.
578.4	In the 1950s, people
578.4	were trying to figure out
581.677	how superfluid helium worked.
584.573	There was a theory.
585.773	It was due to a Russian
585.773	mathematical physicist.
588.208	It was a complicated theory;
589.642	I'll tell you what it was soon enough.
591.777	It was a terribly complicated theory,
593.649	full of very difficult
593.649	integrals and formulas
596.51	and mathematics and so forth.
598.86	And it sort of worked,
598.86	but it didn't work very well.
602.121	The only way it worked
603.487	is when the helium atoms
603.487	were very, very far apart.
606.73	And unfortunately,
609.467	the helium atoms in liquid helium
609.467	are right on top of each other.
612.649	Feynman decided, as a sort
612.649	of amateur helium physicist,
616.014	that he would try to figure it out.
618.288	He had an idea, a very clear idea.
620.716	He would try to figure out
622.134	what the quantum wave function
622.134	of this huge number of atoms looked like.
627.234	He would try to visualize it,
628.905	guided by a small number
628.905	of simple principles.
631.86	The small number of simple principles
631.86	were very, very simple.
634.86	The first one was that when
634.86	helium atoms touch each other,
638.261	they repel.
639.593	The implication of that is that
639.593	the wave function has to go to zero,
643.015	it has to vanish when the helium
643.015	atoms touch each other.
646.124	The other fact
646.124	is that in the ground state --
648.457	the lowest energy state
648.457	of a quantum system --
651.218	the wave function is always very smooth;
654.513	it has the minimum number of wiggles.
656.632	So he sat down --
658.184	and I imagine he had nothing more
660.479	than a simple piece
660.479	of paper and a pencil --
662.916	and he tried to write down,
662.916	and did write down,
665.18	the simplest function
665.18	that he could think of,
667.499	which had the boundary conditions
669.5	that the wave function
669.5	vanish when things touch
671.988	and is smooth in between.
674.493	He wrote down a simple thing --
674.493	so simple, in fact,
677.256	that I suspect a really smart
677.256	high-school student
680.407	who didn't even have calculus
681.86	could understand what he wrote down.
684.337	The thing was, that simple thing
684.337	that he wrote down
687.51	explained everything that was known
687.51	at the time about liquid helium,
691.075	and then some.
692.764	I've always wondered
692.764	whether the professionals --
695.765	the real professional helium physicists --
697.85	were just a little bit
697.85	embarrassed by this.
700.422	They had their super-powerful technique,
703.115	and they couldn't do as well.
704.915	Incidentally, I'll tell you
704.915	what that super-powerful technique was.
709.066	It was the technique of Feynman diagrams.
711.639	(Laughter)
713.52	He did it again in 1968.
716.781	In 1968, in my own university --
716.781	I wasn't there at the time --
721.791	they were exploring
721.791	the structure of the proton.
724.757	The proton is obviously made
724.757	of a whole bunch of little particles;
728.397	this was more or less known.
730.782	And the way to analyze it was,
730.782	of course, Feynman diagrams.
734.142	That's what Feynman diagrams
734.142	were constructed for --
736.707	to understand particles.
738.494	The experiments that were going on
738.494	were very simple:
741.13	you simply take the proton,
742.489	and you hit it really sharply
742.489	with an electron.
745.123	This was the thing
745.123	the Feynman diagrams were for.
748.251	The only problem was that
748.251	Feynman diagrams are complicated.
752.338	They're difficult integrals.
753.902	If you could do all of them,
753.902	you would have a very precise theory,
757.097	but you couldn't --
757.097	they were just too complicated.
760.573	People were trying to do them.
762.058	You could do a one-loop diagram.
762.058	Don't worry about one loop.
765.002	One loop, two loops --
765.002	maybe you could do a three-loop diagram,
768.031	but beyond that, you couldn't do anything.
770.109	"Feynman said, ""Forget all of that."
771.777	Just think of the proton
773.272	as an assemblage, a swarm,
773.272	"of little particles."""
777.629	"He called them ""partons."""
779.304	"He said, ""Just think of it as a swarm"
779.304	"of partons moving real fast."""
785.031	Because they're moving real fast,
788.256	relativity says the internal
788.256	motions go very slow.
793.081	The electron hits it suddenly --
794.717	it's like taking a very sudden
794.717	snapshot of the proton.
799.413	What do you see?
800.592	You see a frozen bunch of partons.
804.65	They don't move,
805.856	and because they don't move
805.856	during the course of the experiment,
808.936	you don't have to worry
808.936	about how they're moving.
811.269	You don't have to worry
811.269	about the forces between them.
813.899	You just get to think of it
813.899	"as a population of frozen partons."""
819.574	This was the key to analyzing
819.574	these experiments.
823.062	Extremely effective.
826.247	Somebody said the word
826.247	"""revolution"" is a bad word."
828.773	I suppose it is,
828.773	"so I won't say ""revolution,"""
830.938	but it certainly evolved very, very deeply
830.938	our understanding of the proton,
836.464	and of particles beyond that.
838.63	Well, I had some more
838.63	that I was going to tell you
841.272	about my connection with Feynman,
842.953	what he was like,
844.151	but I see I have exactly half a minute.
846.479	So I think I'll just finish up by saying:
850.43	I actually don't think
850.43	Feynman would have liked this event.
853.25	I think he would have said,
853.25	"""I don't need this."""
858.142	But ...
859.316	(Laughter)
860.348	How should we honor Feynman?
861.73	How should we really honor Feynman?
863.436	I think the answer
863.436	is we should honor Feynman
866.604	by getting as much baloney
866.604	out of our own sandwiches
870.59	as we can.
872.201	Thank you.
873.376	(Applause)
