12.634	I consider it my life's mission
15.877	to convey the urgency
15.877	of climate change through my work.
19.961	I've traveled north to the Arctic
19.961	to the capture the unfolding story
23.726	of polar melt,
25.229	and south to the Equator to document
25.229	the subsequent rising seas.
29.903	Most recently, I visited
29.903	the icy coast of Greenland
33.617	and the low-lying islands of the Maldives,
36.507	connecting two seemingly disparate
36.507	but equally endangered
41.008	parts of our planet.
43.504	My drawings explore moments
43.504	of transition, turbulence
49.571	and tranquility in the landscape,
52.309	allowing viewers to emotionally connect
55.815	with a place you might never
55.815	have the chance to visit.
59.185	I choose to convey the beauty
59.185	as opposed to the devastation.
64.23	If you can experience the sublimity
64.23	of these landscapes,
68.686	perhaps you'll be inspired
68.686	to protect and preserve them.
73.545	Behavioral psychology tells us
73.545	that we take action
76.936	and make decisions based
76.936	on our emotions above all else.
81.497	And studies have shown
81.497	that art impacts our emotions
84.957	more effectively than a scary news report.
89.193	Experts predict ice-free Arctic summers
92.661	as early as 2020.
95.521	And sea levels are likely to rise
95.521	between two and ten feet
99.712	by century's end.
102.364	I have dedicated my career
102.364	to illuminating these projections
107.064	with an accessible medium,
109.152	one that moves us in a way
109.152	that statistics may not.
114.684	My process begins
114.684	with traveling to the places
117.387	at the forefront of climate change.
119.71	On-site, I take thousands of photographs.
122.696	Back in the studio,
123.963	I work from both my memory
123.963	of the experience and the photographs
128.247	to create very large-scale compositions,
130.526	sometimes over 10 feet wide.
133.412	I draw with soft pastel, which is dry
133.412	like charcoal, but colors.
138.456	I consider my work drawings
138.456	but others call them painting.
142.203	I cringe, though, when I'm referred to
142.203	"as a ""finger painter."""
146.248	(Laughter)
147.39	But I don't use any tools
149.719	and I have always used
149.719	my fingers and palms
152.22	to manipulate the pigment on the paper.
155.99	Drawing is a form of meditation for me.
160.354	It quiets my mind.
162.437	I don't perceive what I'm drawing
164.268	as ice or water.
165.665	Instead, the image is stripped down
168.151	to its most basic form of color and shape.
172.964	Once the piece is complete,
174.33	I can finally experience
174.33	the composition as a whole,
177.49	as an iceberg floating
177.49	through glassy water,
180.076	or a wave cresting with foam.
183.884	On average, a piece this size
183.884	takes me about,
187.83	as you can see, 10 seconds.
189.544	(Laughter)
191.348	(Applause)
195.336	Really, more like 200 hours,
199.816	But I've been drawing ever since
199.816	I could hold a crayon, really.
202.822	My mom was an artist, and growing up,
204.759	we always had art supplies
204.759	all over the house.
207.269	My mother's love of photography
209.846	propelled her to the most
209.846	remote regions of the earth,
213.405	and my family and I were fortunate enough
215.835	to join and support her
215.835	on these adventures.
219.139	We rode camels in Northern Africa
221.871	and mushed on dog sleds
221.871	near the North Pole.
225.871	In August of 2012,
225.871	I led my first expedition,
230.091	taking a group of artists and scholars
230.091	up the northwest coast of Greenland.
236.232	My mother was originally
236.232	supposed to lead this trip.
239.146	She and I were in the early
239.146	stages of planning,
241.885	as we had intended to go together,
244.471	when she fell victim to a brain tumor.
247.812	The cancer quickly took over
247.812	her body and mind,
251.833	and she passed away six months later.
255.11	During the months of her illness, though,
257.119	her dedication to the expedition
257.119	never wavered, and I made a promise
262.643	to carry out her final journey.
265.374	My mother's passion for the Arctic
268.541	echoed through my experience in Greenland,
271.938	and I felt the power
274.938	and the fragility of the landscape.
278.738	The sheer size of the icebergs
281.422	is humbling.
283.168	The ice fields are alive
283.168	with movement and sound
286.615	in a way that I never expected.
289.284	I expanded the scale of my compositions
291.556	to give you that same sense of awe
291.556	that I experienced.
297.021	Yet, while the grandeur
297.021	of the ice is evident,
300.74	so, too, is its vulnerability.
303.042	From our boat,
304.281	I could see the ice sweating
304.281	under the unseasonably warm sun.
310.94	We had a chance to visit
310.94	many of the Inuit communities in Greenland
314.527	that now face huge challenges.
317.381	The locals spoke to me
317.381	of vast areas of sea ice
320.721	that are no longer
320.721	freezing over as they once did.
323.431	And without ice, their hunting
323.431	and harvesting grounds
326.533	are severely diminished,
328.319	threatening their way
328.319	of life and survival.
332.616	The melting glaciers in Greenland
334.535	are one of the largest
334.535	contributing factors to rising sea levels,
338.903	which have already begun to drown
341.043	some of our world's lowest-lying islands.
344.942	One year after my trip to Greenland,
344.942	I visited the Maldives,
349.145	the lowest and flattest country
349.145	in the entire world.
352.752	While I was there, I collected
352.752	images and inspiration
356.809	for a new body of work:
359.072	drawings of waves lapping
359.072	on the coast of a nation
363.129	that could be entirely underwater
363.129	within this century.
369.484	Devastating events happen every day
373.051	on scales both global and personal.
376.844	When I was in Greenland,
378.131	I scattered my mother's ashes
378.131	amidst the melting ice.
382.743	Now she remains a part
382.743	of the landscape she loved so much,
387.854	even as it, too, passes
387.854	and takes on new form.
393.095	Among the many gifts my mother gave me
395.887	was the ability to focus on the positive,
398.911	rather than the negative.
401.083	My drawings celebrate the beauty
401.083	of what we all stand to lose.
407.845	I hope they can serve as records
407.845	of sublime landscapes in flux,
413.663	documenting the transition
413.663	and inspiring our global community
418.309	to take action for the future.
421.102	Thank you.
422.333	(Applause)
