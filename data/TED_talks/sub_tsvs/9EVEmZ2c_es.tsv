12.381	"""Even in purely non-religious terms,"
16.604	homosexuality represents a misuse of the sexual faculty.
22.659	It is a pathetic little second-rate substitute for reality --
27.285	a pitiable flight from life.
29.685	As such, it deserves no compassion,
33.508	it deserves no treatment
36.07	as minority martyrdom,
38.837	"and it deserves not to be deemed anything but a pernicious sickness."""
45.515	That's from Time magazine in 1966, when I was three years old.
50.737	And last year, the president of the United States
54.651	came out in favor of gay marriage.
57.234	(Applause)
64.683	And my question is, how did we get from there to here?
70.385	How did an illness become an identity?
75.125	When I was perhaps six years old,
78.085	I went to a shoe store with my mother and my brother.
81.018	And at the end of buying our shoes,
83.425	the salesman said to us that we could each have a balloon to take home.
87.217	My brother wanted a red balloon, and I wanted a pink balloon.
92.883	My mother said that she thought I'd really rather have a blue balloon.
97.798	But I said that I definitely wanted the pink one.
100.934	And she reminded me that my favorite color was blue.
106.353	The fact that my favorite color now is blue, but I'm still gay --
111.143	(Laughter) --
114.251	is evidence of both my mother's influence and its limits.
118.623	(Laughter)
120.69	(Applause)
127.557	When I was little, my mother used to say,
130.114	"""The love you have for your children is like no other feeling in the world."
134.65	"And until you have children, you don't know what it's like."""
137.995	And when I was little, I took it as the greatest compliment in the world
141.189	that she would say that about parenting my brother and me.
144.009	And when I was an adolescent, I thought
146.637	that I'm gay, and so I probably can't have a family.
150.001	And when she said it, it made me anxious.
152.378	And after I came out of the closet,
153.904	when she continued to say it, it made me furious.
157.104	"I said, ""I'm gay. That's not the direction that I'm headed in."
161.245	"And I want you to stop saying that."""
167.013	About 20 years ago, I was asked by my editors at The New York Times Magazine
172.07	to write a piece about deaf culture.
174.511	And I was rather taken aback.
176.348	I had thought of deafness entirely as an illness.
178.543	Those poor people, they couldn't hear.
180.269	They lacked hearing, and what could we do for them?
183.043	And then I went out into the deaf world.
185.16	I went to deaf clubs.
187.551	I saw performances of deaf theater and of deaf poetry.
191.471	I even went to the Miss Deaf America contest in Nashville, Tennessee
197.682	where people complained about that slurry Southern signing.
201.526	(Laughter)
205.782	And as I plunged deeper and deeper into the deaf world,
209.709	I become convinced that deafness was a culture
212.715	and that the people in the deaf world who said,
215.077	"""We don't lack hearing, we have membership in a culture,"""
218.444	were saying something that was viable.
221.021	It wasn't my culture,
222.526	and I didn't particularly want to rush off and join it,
225.244	but I appreciated that it was a culture
228.075	and that for the people who were members of it,
230.21	it felt as valuable as Latino culture or gay culture or Jewish culture.
236.499	It felt as valid perhaps even as American culture.
241.499	Then a friend of a friend of mine had a daughter who was a dwarf.
244.913	And when her daughter was born,
246.392	she suddenly found herself confronting questions
248.723	that now began to seem quite resonant to me.
251.51	She was facing the question of what to do with this child.
255.377	"Should she say, ""You're just like everyone else but a little bit shorter?"""
258.837	Or should she try to construct some kind of dwarf identity,
262.052	get involved in the Little People of America,
264.599	become aware of what was happening for dwarfs?
267.392	And I suddenly thought,
268.993	most deaf children are born to hearing parents.
271.212	Those hearing parents tend to try to cure them.
274.011	Those deaf people discover community somehow in adolescence.
278.177	Most gay people are born to straight parents.
280.526	Those straight parents often want them to function
282.974	in what they think of as the mainstream world,
285.244	and those gay people have to discover identity later on.
288.848	And here was this friend of mine
290.464	looking at these questions of identity with her dwarf daughter.
293.793	And I thought, there it is again:
295.569	A family that perceives itself to be normal
298.135	with a child who seems to be extraordinary.
300.505	And I hatched the idea that there are really two kinds of identity.
305.017	There are vertical identities,
306.941	which are passed down generationally from parent to child.
309.923	Those are things like ethnicity, frequently nationality, language, often religion.
315.526	Those are things you have in common with your parents and with your children.
320.004	And while some of them can be difficult,
322.277	there's no attempt to cure them.
324.471	You can argue that it's harder in the United States --
327.883	our current presidency notwithstanding --
329.857	to be a person of color.
331.69	And yet, we have nobody who is trying to ensure
334.389	that the next generation of children born to African-Americans and Asians
338.277	come out with creamy skin and yellow hair.
341.666	There are these other identities which you have to learn from a peer group.
345.943	And I call them horizontal identities,
348.241	because the peer group is the horizontal experience.
351.136	These are identities that are alien to your parents
353.704	and that you have to discover when you get to see them in peers.
357.889	And those identities, those horizontal identities,
360.974	people have almost always tried to cure.
364.69	And I wanted to look at what the process is
367.358	through which people who have those identities
369.575	come to a good relationship with them.
372.303	And it seemed to me that there were three levels of acceptance
376.556	that needed to take place.
377.995	There's self-acceptance, there's family acceptance, and there's social acceptance.
383.544	And they don't always coincide.
385.491	And a lot of the time, people who have these conditions are very angry
389.627	because they feel as though their parents don't love them,
392.691	when what actually has happened is that their parents don't accept them.
396.99	Love is something that ideally is there unconditionally
400.156	throughout the relationship between a parent and a child.
403.203	But acceptance is something that takes time.
406.469	It always takes time.
408.704	One of the dwarfs I got to know was a guy named Clinton Brown.
413.596	When he was born, he was diagnosed with diastrophic dwarfism,
416.998	a very disabling condition,
418.776	and his parents were told that he would never walk, he would never talk,
422.182	he would have no intellectual capacity,
424.157	and he would probably not even recognize them.
426.856	And it was suggested to them that they leave him at the hospital
430.277	so that he could die there quietly.
432.491	And his mother said she wasn't going to do it.
434.455	And she took her son home.
436.222	And even though she didn't have a lot of educational or financial advantages,
439.856	she found the best doctor in the country
441.804	for dealing with diastrophic dwarfism,
444.003	and she got Clinton enrolled with him.
446.169	And in the course of his childhood,
448.25	he had 30 major surgical procedures.
451.323	And he spent all this time stuck in the hospital
453.51	while he was having those procedures,
455.203	as a result of which he now can walk.
457.611	And while he was there, they sent tutors around to help him with his school work.
461.961	And he worked very hard because there was nothing else to do.
464.79	And he ended up achieving at a level
466.537	that had never before been contemplated by any member of his family.
470.112	He was the first one in his family, in fact, to go to college,
473.442	where he lived on campus and drove a specially-fitted car
476.824	that accommodated his unusual body.
479.608	And his mother told me this story of coming home one day --
482.571	and he went to college nearby --
484.336	"and she said, ""I saw that car, which you can always recognize,"
487.423	"in the parking lot of a bar,"" she said. (Laughter)"
491.846	"""And I thought to myself, they're six feet tall, he's three feet tall."
496.456	"Two beers for them is four beers for him."""
498.756	"She said, ""I knew I couldn't go in there and interrupt him,"
501.369	"but I went home, and I left him eight messages on his cell phone."""
505.557	"She said, ""And then I thought,"
507.042	if someone had said to me when he was born
509.142	"that my future worry would be that he'd go drinking and driving with his college buddies -- """
514.755	(Applause)
523.537	"And I said to her, ""What do you think you did"
525.576	"that helped him to emerge as this charming, accomplished, wonderful person?"""
530.036	"And she said, ""What did I do? I loved him, that's all."
534.723	Clinton just always had that light in him.
537.859	"And his father and I were lucky enough to be the first to see it there."""
544.272	I'm going to quote from another magazine of the '60s.
547.31	This one is from 1968 -- The Atlantic Monthly, voice of liberal America --
553.004	written by an important bioethicist.
555.808	"He said, ""There is no reason to feel guilty"
559.616	about putting a Down syndrome child away,
562.921	whether it is put away in the sense of hidden in a sanitarium
567.98	or in a more responsible, lethal sense.
571.889	It is sad, yes -- dreadful. But it carries no guilt.
576.837	True guilt arises only from an offense against a person,
580.937	"and a Down's is not a person."""
585.538	There's been a lot of ink given to the enormous progress that we've made
589.479	in the treatment of gay people.
591.606	The fact that our attitude has changed is in the headlines every day.
595.642	But we forget how we used to see people who had other differences,
600.338	how we used to see people who were disabled,
602.476	how inhuman we held people to be.
605.389	And the change that's been accomplished there,
607.267	which is almost equally radical,
609.093	is one that we pay not very much attention to.
611.969	One of the families I interviewed, Tom and Karen Robards,
615.921	were taken aback when, as young and successful New Yorkers,
619.649	their first child was diagnosed with Down syndrome.
623.104	They thought the educational opportunities for him were not what they should be,
627.19	and so they decided they would build a little center --
631.043	two classrooms that they started with a few other parents --
634.707	to educate kids with D.S.
637.17	And over the years, that center grew into something called the Cooke Center,
641.07	where there are now thousands upon thousands
643.227	of children with intellectual disabilities who are being taught.
647.004	In the time since that Atlantic Monthly story ran,
650.142	the life expectancy for people with Down syndrome has tripled.
654.315	The experience of Down syndrome people includes those who are actors,
659.074	those who are writers, some who are able to live fully independently in adulthood.
665.127	The Robards had a lot to do with that.
667.002	"And I said, ""Do you regret it?"
668.536	Do you wish your child didn't have Down syndrome?
671.139	"Do you wish you'd never heard of it?"""
672.988	And interestingly his father said,
675.355	"""Well, for David, our son, I regret it,"
677.942	because for David, it's a difficult way to be in the world,
681.322	and I'd like to give David an easier life.
684.07	"But I think if we lost everyone with Down syndrome, it would be a catastrophic loss."""
689.17	"And Karen Robards said to me, ""I'm with Tom."
692.601	For David, I would cure it in an instant to give him an easier life.
696.542	But speaking for myself -- well, I would never have believed 23 years ago when he was born
701.978	that I could come to such a point --
703.988	speaking for myself, it's made me so much better and so much kinder
708.336	and so much more purposeful in my whole life,
711.37	"that speaking for myself, I wouldn't give it up for anything in the world."""
717.779	We live at a point when social acceptance for these and many other conditions
722.164	is on the up and up.
723.902	And yet we also live at the moment
725.738	when our ability to eliminate those conditions
728.629	has reached a height we never imagined before.
731.237	Most deaf infants born in the United States now
734.396	will receive Cochlear implants,
736.189	which are put into the brain and connected to a receiver,
741.004	and which allow them to acquire a facsimile of hearing and to use oral speech.
746.022	A compound that has been tested in mice, BMN-111,
750.321	is useful in preventing the action of the achondroplasia gene.
755.374	Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism,
758.119	and mice who have been given that substance and who have the achondroplasia gene,
762.086	grow to full size.
764.004	Testing in humans is around the corner.
766.555	There are blood tests which are making progress
768.811	that would pick up Down syndrome more clearly and earlier in pregnancies than ever before,
774.306	making it easier and easier for people to eliminate those pregnancies,
779.55	or to terminate them.
780.87	And so we have both social progress and medical progress.
785.537	And I believe in both of them.
787.389	I believe the social progress is fantastic and meaningful and wonderful,
791.444	and I think the same thing about the medical progress.
794.54	But I think it's a tragedy when one of them doesn't see the other.
798.903	And when I see the way they're intersecting
800.974	in conditions like the three I've just described,
803.188	I sometimes think it's like those moments in grand opera
806.838	when the hero realizes he loves the heroine
809.442	at the exact moment that she lies expiring on a divan.
813.889	(Laughter)
816.688	We have to think about how we feel about cures altogether.
820.57	And a lot of the time the question of parenthood is,
823.436	what do we validate in our children,
825.288	and what do we cure in them?
827.04	Jim Sinclair, a prominent autism activist, said,
831.211	"""When parents say 'I wish my child did not have autism,'"
835.865	what they're really saying is 'I wish the child I have did not exist
840.724	and I had a different, non-autistic child instead.'
844.743	Read that again. This is what we hear when you mourn over our existence.
849.535	This is what we hear when you pray for a cure --
852.737	that your fondest wish for us
854.642	is that someday we will cease to be
857.021	"and strangers you can love will move in behind our faces."""
862.576	It's a very extreme point of view,
865.642	but it points to the reality that people engage with the life they have
869.771	and they don't want to be cured or changed or eliminated.
874.336	They want to be whoever it is that they've come to be.
877.556	One of the families I interviewed for this project
881.356	was the family of Dylan Klebold who was one of the perpetrators of the Columbine massacre.
886.61	It took a long time to persuade them to talk to me,
889.405	and once they agreed, they were so full of their story
892.169	that they couldn't stop telling it.
893.868	And the first weekend I spent with them -- the first of many --
896.485	I recorded more than 20 hours of conversation.
899.606	And on Sunday night, we were all exhausted.
901.869	We were sitting in the kitchen. Sue Klebold was fixing dinner.
904.755	"And I said, ""If Dylan were here now,"
907.276	"do you have a sense of what you'd want to ask him?"""
910.121	"And his father said, ""I sure do."
912.489	"I'd want to ask him what the hell he thought he was doing."""
916.038	And Sue looked at the floor, and she thought for a minute.
919.676	And then she looked back up and said,
921.855	"""I would ask him to forgive me for being his mother"
925.918	"and never knowing what was going on inside his head."""
930.342	When I had dinner with her a couple of years later --
933.31	one of many dinners that we had together --
935.237	"she said, ""You know, when it first happened,"
938.647	I used to wish that I had never married, that I had never had children.
942.455	If I hadn't gone to Ohio State and crossed paths with Tom,
945.947	this child wouldn't have existed and this terrible thing wouldn't have happened.
949.589	But I've come to feel that I love the children I had so much
954.104	that I don't want to imagine a life without them.
957.407	I recognize the pain they caused to others, for which there can be no forgiveness,
962.336	"but the pain they caused to me, there is,"" she said."
965.8	"""So while I recognize that it would have been better for the world"
969.592	if Dylan had never been born,
972.102	"I've decided that it would not have been better for me."""
977.584	I thought it was surprising how all of these families had all of these children with all of these problems,
984.068	problems that they mostly would have done anything to avoid,
987.101	and that they had all found so much meaning in that experience of parenting.
990.92	And then I thought, all of us who have children
994.121	love the children we have, with their flaws.
996.813	If some glorious angel suddenly descended through my living room ceiling
1001.069	and offered to take away the children I have
1003.279	and give me other, better children -- more polite, funnier, nicer, smarter --
1009.873	I would cling to the children I have and pray away that atrocious spectacle.
1014.978	And ultimately I feel
1016.97	that in the same way that we test flame-retardant pajamas in an inferno
1020.548	to ensure they won't catch fire when our child reaches across the stove,
1025.02	so these stories of families negotiating these extreme differences
1029.088	reflect on the universal experience of parenting,
1031.769	which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think,
1035.903	where did you come from?
1038.092	(Laughter)
1040.546	It turns out that while each of these individual differences is siloed --
1045.521	there are only so many families dealing with schizophrenia,
1048.066	there are only so many families of children who are transgender,
1050.703	there are only so many families of prodigies --
1052.897	who also face similar challenges in many ways --
1055.181	there are only so many families in each of those categories --
1057.871	but if you start to think
1059.303	that the experience of negotiating difference within your family
1062.869	is what people are addressing,
1064.899	then you discover that it's a nearly universal phenomenon.
1068.636	Ironically, it turns out, that it's our differences, and our negotiation of difference,
1073.271	that unite us.
1075.699	I decided to have children while I was working on this project.
1081.013	And many people were astonished and said,
1084.129	"""But how can you decide to have children"
1085.977	"in the midst of studying everything that can go wrong?"""
1090.083	"And I said, ""I'm not studying everything that can go wrong."
1093.313	What I'm studying is how much love there can be,
1096.404	"even when everything appears to be going wrong."""
1101.129	I thought a lot about the mother of one disabled child I had seen,
1106.764	a severely disabled child who died through caregiver neglect.
1110.536	And when his ashes were interred, his mother said,
1113.346	"""I pray here for forgiveness for having been twice robbed,"
1121.38	"once of the child I wanted and once of the son I loved."""
1127.436	And I figured it was possible then for anyone to love any child
1132.072	if they had the effective will to do so.
1134.604	So my husband is the biological father of two children
1139.629	with some lesbian friends in Minneapolis.
1142.39	I had a close friend from college who'd gone through a divorce and wanted to have children.
1148.214	And so she and I have a daughter,
1150.112	and mother and daughter live in Texas.
1152.323	And my husband and I have a son who lives with us all the time
1155.562	of whom I am the biological father,
1157.946	and our surrogate for the pregnancy was Laura,
1161.881	the lesbian mother of Oliver and Lucy in Minneapolis.
1164.929	(Applause)
1173.584	So the shorthand is five parents of four children in three states.
1179.048	And there are people who think that the existence of my family
1182.404	somehow undermines or weakens or damages their family.
1187.069	And there are people who think that families like mine
1190.697	shouldn't be allowed to exist.
1192.381	And I don't accept subtractive models of love, only additive ones.
1198.036	And I believe that in the same way that we need species diversity
1201.562	to ensure that the planet can go on,
1203.813	so we need this diversity of affection and diversity of family
1208.014	in order to strengthen the ecosphere of kindness.
1212.695	The day after our son was born,
1215.065	the pediatrician came into the hospital room and said she was concerned.
1219.637	He wasn't extending his legs appropriately.
1222.77	She said that might mean that he had brain damage.
1225.679	In so far as he was extending them, he was doing so asymmetrically,
1229.04	which she thought could mean that there was a tumor of some kind in action.
1232.903	And he had a very large head, which she thought might indicate hydrocephalus.
1237.686	And as she told me all of these things,
1239.316	I felt the very center of my being pouring out onto the floor.
1243.311	And I thought, here I had been working for years
1245.654	on a book about how much meaning people had found
1248.203	in the experience of parenting children who are disabled,
1251.736	and I didn't want to join their number.
1255.636	Because what I was encountering was an idea of illness.
1258.331	And like all parents since the dawn of time,
1260.581	I wanted to protect my child from illness.
1263.927	And I wanted also to protect myself from illness.
1267.138	And yet, I knew from the work I had done
1269.698	that if he had any of the things we were about to start testing for,
1273.805	that those would ultimately be his identity,
1276.878	and if they were his identity they would become my identity,
1281.112	that that illness was going to take a very different shape as it unfolded.
1285.269	We took him to the MRI machine, we took him to the CAT scanner,
1288.3	we took this day-old child and gave him over for an arterial blood draw.
1292.298	We felt helpless.
1293.492	And at the end of five hours,
1294.97	they said that his brain was completely clear
1297.194	and that he was by then extending his legs correctly.
1300.204	And when I asked the pediatrician what had been going on,
1303.136	she said she thought in the morning he had probably had a cramp.
1307.471	(Laughter)
1311.036	But I thought how my mother was right.
1318.869	I thought, the love you have for your children
1322.364	is unlike any other feeling in the world,
1325.694	and until you have children, you don't know what it feels like.
1331.858	I think children had ensnared me
1334.179	the moment I connected fatherhood with loss.
1337.705	But I'm not sure I would have noticed that
1339.637	if I hadn't been so in the thick of this research project of mine.
1345.162	I'd encountered so much strange love,
1348.394	and I fell very naturally into its bewitching patterns.
1352.179	And I saw how splendor can illuminate even the most abject vulnerabilities.
1358.906	During these 10 years, I had witnessed and learned
1362.712	the terrifying joy of unbearable responsibility,
1366.204	and I had come to see how it conquers everything else.
1369.736	And while I had sometimes thought the parents I was interviewing were fools,
1374.037	enslaving themselves to a lifetime's journey with their thankless children
1378.987	and trying to breed identity out of misery,
1381.936	I realized that day that my research had built me a plank
1386.572	and that I was ready to join them on their ship.
1389.986	Thank you.
1391.803	(Applause)
