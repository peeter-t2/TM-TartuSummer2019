15.26	Today I want to talk to you
17.26	about ethnic conflict
19.26	and civil war.
21.26	These are not normally the most cheerful of topics,
24.26	nor do they generally generate
26.26	the kind of good news
28.26	that this conference is about.
31.26	Yet, not only is there at least some good news
34.26	to be told about fewer such conflicts now
37.26	than two decades ago,
39.26	but what is perhaps more important
41.26	is that we also have come
43.26	to a much better understanding of what can be done
46.26	to further reduce the number
48.26	of ethnic conflicts and civil wars
51.26	and the suffering that they inflict.
54.26	Three things stand out:
56.26	leadership, diplomacy
59.26	and institutional design.
62.26	What I will focus on in my talk
64.26	is why they matter, how they matter,
67.26	and what we can all do
69.26	to make sure that they continue to matter
71.26	in the right ways,
73.26	that is, how all of us can contribute
76.26	to developing and honing the skills
79.26	of local and global leaders
82.26	to make peace
84.26	and to make it last.
86.26	But let's start at the beginning.
89.26	Civil wars have made news headlines
91.26	for many decades now,
93.26	and ethnic conflicts in particular
95.26	have been a near constant presence
98.26	as a major international security threat.
101.26	For nearly two decades now,
104.26	the news has been bad
106.26	and the images have been haunting.
109.26	In Georgia, after years of stalemate,
112.26	we saw a full-scale resurgence of violence
115.26	in August, 2008.
117.26	This quickly escalated into a five-day war
120.26	between Russia and Georgia,
122.26	leaving Georgia ever more divided.
125.26	In Kenya, contested presidential elections in 2007 --
128.26	we just heard about them --
131.26	quickly led to high levels
133.26	of inter-ethnic violence
135.26	and the killing and displacement
137.26	of thousands of people.
139.26	In Sri Lanka,
141.26	a decades-long civil war
143.26	between the Tamil minority
145.26	and the Sinhala majority
147.26	led to a bloody climax in 2009,
150.26	after perhaps as many as 100,000
152.26	people had been killed
154.26	since 1983.
156.26	In Kyrgyzstan, just over the last few weeks,
159.26	unprecedented levels of violence occurred
162.26	between ethnic Kyrgyz
164.26	and ethnic Uzbeks.
166.26	Hundreds have been killed,
168.26	and more than 100,000 displaced,
171.26	including many ethnic Uzbeks
173.26	who fled to neighboring Uzbekistan.
176.26	In the Middle East,
178.26	conflict between Israelis and Palestinians
181.26	continues unabated,
183.26	and it becomes ever more difficult
185.26	to see how, just how
188.26	a possible, sustainable solution
190.26	can be achieved.
193.26	Darfur may have slipped from the news headlines,
196.26	but the killing and displacement there
198.26	continues as well,
200.26	and the sheer human misery that it creates
203.26	is very hard to fathom.
205.26	And in Iraq, finally,
207.26	violence is on the rise again,
210.26	and the country has yet to form a government
213.26	four months after
215.26	its last parliamentary elections.
220.26	But hang on, this talk is to be about the good news.
223.26	So are these now the images of the past?
227.26	Well, notwithstanding the gloomy pictures
230.26	from the Middle East, Darfur,
232.26	Iraq, elsewhere,
234.26	there is a longer-term trend
236.26	that does represent some good news.
239.26	Over the past two decades, since the end of the Cold War,
242.26	there has been an overall decline
245.26	in the number of civil wars.
247.26	Since the high in the early 1990s,
250.26	with about 50 such civil wars ongoing,
253.26	we now have 30 percent fewer
255.26	such conflicts today.
257.26	The number of people killed in civil wars
259.26	also is much lower today
262.26	than it was a decade ago or two.
265.26	But this trend is less unambiguous.
268.26	The highest level of deaths on the battlefield
271.26	was recorded between 1998 and 2001,
274.26	with about 80,000 soldiers, policemen and rebels
277.26	killed every year.
279.26	The lowest number of combatant casualties
281.26	occurred in 2003,
284.26	with just 20,000 killed.
287.26	Despite the up and down since then,
290.26	the overall trend --
292.26	and this is the important bit --
294.26	clearly points downward
296.26	for the past two decades.
299.26	The news about civilian casualties
301.26	is also less bad than it used to be.
303.26	From over 12,000 civilians
305.26	deliberately killed in civil wars
307.26	in 1997 and 1998,
310.26	a decade later,
312.26	this figure stands at 4,000.
315.26	This is a decrease by two-thirds.
318.26	This decline would be even more obvious
320.26	if we factored in the genocide in Rwanda
322.26	in 1994.
324.26	But then 800,000 civilians were slaughtered
327.26	in a matter of just a few months.
330.26	This certainly is an accomplishment
332.26	that must never be surpassed.
335.26	What is also important is to note
337.26	that these figures only tell part of the story.
340.26	They exclude people
342.26	that died as a consequence of civil war,
344.26	from hunger or disease, for example.
346.26	And they also do not properly account
348.26	for civilian suffering more generally.
352.26	Torture, rape and ethnic cleansing
355.26	have become highly effective,
358.26	if often non-lethal, weapons in civil war.
362.26	To put it differently,
364.26	for the civilians that suffer the consequences
367.26	of ethnic conflict and civil war,
370.26	there is no good war
373.26	and there is no bad peace.
377.26	Thus, even though every civilian killed,
379.26	maimed, raped, or tortured is one too many,
382.26	the fact that the number
384.26	of civilian casualties
386.26	is clearly lower today
388.26	than it was a decade ago,
390.26	is good news.
393.26	So, we have fewer conflicts today
395.26	in which fewer people get killed.
398.26	And the big question, of course,
400.26	is why?
402.26	In some cases,
404.26	there is a military victory of one side.
406.26	This is a solution of sorts,
408.26	but rarely is it one
410.26	that comes without human costs
412.26	or humanitarian consequences.
415.26	The defeat of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka
418.26	is perhaps the most recent example of this,
420.26	but we have seen similar
422.26	so-called military solutions
425.26	in the Balkans, in the South Caucasus
427.26	and across most of Africa.
430.26	At times, they are complimented
432.26	by negotiated settlements,
434.26	or at least cease-fire agreements,
436.26	and peacekeepers are deployed.
438.26	But hardly ever do they represent
440.26	a resounding success --
442.26	Bosnia and Herzegovina
444.26	perhaps more so than Georgia.
446.26	But for many parts of Africa,
448.26	a colleague of mine once put it this way,
451.26	"""The cease-fire on Tuesday night"
454.26	was reached just in time
456.26	"for the genocide to start on Wednesday morning."""
461.26	But let's look at the good news again.
463.26	If there's no solution on the battlefield,
465.26	three factors can account
467.26	for the prevention of ethnic conflict and civil war,
471.26	or for sustainable peace afterwards:
474.26	leadership, diplomacy
476.26	and institutional design.
479.26	Take the example of Northern Ireland.
482.26	Despite centuries of animosity,
484.26	decades of violence
486.26	and thousands of people killed,
491.26	of an historic agreement.
494.26	Its initial version was skillfully mediated
497.26	by Senator George Mitchell.
499.26	Crucially, for the long-term success
501.26	of the peace process in Northern Ireland,
504.26	he imposed very clear conditions
506.26	for the participation and negotiations.
509.26	Central among them,
511.26	a commitment
513.26	to exclusively peaceful means.
516.26	Subsequent revisions of the agreement
518.26	were facilitated by the British and Irish governments,
521.26	who never wavered in their determination
524.26	to bring peace and stability to Northern Ireland.
527.26	The core institutions
529.26	that were put in place in 1998
531.26	and their modifications
533.26	in 2006 and 2008
535.26	were highly innovative
537.26	and allowed all conflict parties
540.26	to see their core concerns and demands addressed.
544.26	The agreement combines a power-sharing arrangement
546.26	in Northern Ireland
548.26	with cross-border institutions
550.26	that link Belfast and Dublin
552.26	and thus recognizes
554.26	the so-called Irish dimension of the conflict.
557.26	And significantly,
559.26	there's also a clear focus
561.26	on both the rights of individuals
563.26	and the rights of communities.
567.26	The provisions in the agreement may be complex,
570.26	but so is the underlying conflict.
574.26	Perhaps most importantly,
576.26	local leaders repeatedly rose to the challenge of compromise,
580.26	not always fast
582.26	and not always enthusiastically,
585.26	but rise in the end they did.
587.26	Who ever could have imagined
590.26	Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness
593.26	jointly governing Northern Ireland
595.26	as First and Deputy First Minister?
598.26	But then, is Northern Ireland a unique example,
601.26	or does this kind of explanation
603.26	only hold more generally
605.26	in democratic and developed countries?
608.26	By no means.
610.26	The ending of Liberia's long-lasting civil war
613.26	in 2003
615.26	illustrates the importance
617.26	of leadership, diplomacy
619.26	and institutional design
621.26	as much as the successful prevention
623.26	of a full-scale civil war
625.26	in Macedonia in 2001,
628.26	or the successful ending
630.26	of the conflict in Aceh in Indonesia in 2005.
634.26	In all three cases,
636.26	local leaders were willing and able
638.26	to make peace,
640.26	the international community stood ready
643.26	to help them negotiate and implement an agreement,
646.26	and the institutions have lived up
649.26	to the promise that they held
651.26	on the day they were agreed.
653.26	Focusing on leadership, diplomacy
655.26	and institutional design
657.26	also helps explain failures to achieve peace,
660.26	or to make it last.
662.26	The hopes that were vested in the Oslo Accords
664.26	did not lead to an end
666.26	of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.
668.26	Not all the issues that needed to be resolved
671.26	were actually covered in the agreements.
673.26	Rather, local leaders committed
676.26	to revisiting them later on.
679.26	Yet instead of grasping this opportunity,
681.26	local and international leaders
683.26	soon disengaged
685.26	and became distracted
687.26	by the second Intifada, the events of 9/11
690.26	and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
694.26	The comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan
696.26	signed in 2005
698.26	turned out to be less comprehensive than envisaged,
701.26	and its provisions may yet bear the seeds
704.26	of a full-scale return to war
706.26	between north and south.
708.26	Changes and shortcomings in leadership,
711.26	more off than on international diplomacy
714.26	and institutional failures
716.26	account for this
718.26	in almost equal measure.
720.26	Unresolved boundary issues, squabbles over oil revenues,
723.26	the ongoing conflict in Darfur,
725.26	escalating tribal violence in the south
728.26	and generally weak state capacity
730.26	across all of Sudan
732.26	complete a very depressing picture
735.26	of the state of affairs
737.26	in Africa's largest country.
739.26	A final example: Kosovo.
741.26	The failure to achieve
743.26	a negotiated solution for Kosovo
745.26	and the violence, tension
747.26	and de facto partition that resulted from it
750.26	have their reasons
752.26	in many, many different factors.
755.26	Central among them are three.
758.26	First, the intransigence of local leaders
761.26	to settle for nothing less
763.26	than their maximum demands.
766.26	Second, an international diplomatic effort
769.26	that was hampered from the beginning
772.26	by Western support for Kosovo's independence.
776.26	And third, a lack of imagination
779.26	when it came to designing institutions
782.26	that could have addressed the concerns
784.26	of Serbs and Albanians alike.
787.26	By the same token --
789.26	and here we have some good news again --
791.26	the very fact that there is a high-level,
794.26	well-resourced international presence
796.26	in Kosovo
798.26	and the Balkans region more generally
801.26	and the fact that local leaders on both sides
803.26	have showed relative restraint,
805.26	explains why things have not been worse
808.26	over the past two years since 2008.
811.26	So even in situations
813.26	where outcomes are less than optimal,
816.26	local leaders
818.26	and international leaders have a choice,
821.26	and they can make a difference for the better.
824.26	A cold war
826.26	is not as good
828.26	as a cold peace,
830.26	but a cold peace
832.26	is still better than a hot war.
836.26	Good news is also about learning the right lesson.
839.26	So what then distinguishes
841.26	the Israeli/Palestinian conflict
843.26	from that in Northern Ireland,
846.26	or the civil war in Sudan
848.26	from that in Liberia?
850.26	Both successes and failures
853.26	teach us several critically important things
856.26	that we need to bear in mind
858.26	if we want the good news to continue.
860.26	First, leadership.
863.26	In the same way in which ethnic conflict and civil war
867.26	are not natural
869.26	but man-made disasters,
871.26	their prevention and settlement
873.26	does not happen automatically either.
877.26	Leadership needs to be capable,
880.26	determined and visionary
882.26	in its commitment to peace.
884.26	Leaders need to connect to each other
887.26	and to their followers,
889.26	and they need to bring them along
891.26	on what is an often arduous journey
894.26	into a peaceful future.
896.26	Second, diplomacy.
899.26	Diplomacy needs to be well resourced,
902.26	sustained,
904.26	and apply the right mix of incentives and pressures
906.26	on leaders and followers.
908.26	It needs to help them reach an equitable compromise,
911.26	and it needs to ensure
913.26	that a broad coalition
915.26	of local, regional
917.26	and international supporters
919.26	help them implement their agreement.
922.26	Third, institutional design.
925.26	Institutional design requires
927.26	a keen focus on issues,
929.26	innovative thinking
931.26	and flexible and well-funded implementation.
935.26	Conflict parties need to move away
938.26	from maximum demands
940.26	and towards a compromise
942.26	that recognizes each other's needs.
945.26	And they need to think
947.26	about the substance of their agreement
949.26	much more than about
951.26	the labels they want to attach to them.
953.26	Conflict parties also need to be prepared
955.26	to return to the negotiation table
958.26	if the agreement implementation stalls.
962.26	For me personally,
964.26	the most critical lesson of all is this:
967.26	Local commitment to peace
969.26	is all-important,
971.26	but it is often not enough
974.26	to prevent or end violence.
977.26	Yet, no amount of diplomacy
980.26	or institutional design
982.26	can make up for local failures
985.26	and the consequences that they have.
988.26	Therefore, we must invest
991.26	in developing leaders,
994.26	leaders that have the skills,
997.26	vision and determination
999.26	to make peace.
1001.26	Leaders, in other words,
1003.26	that people will trust
1005.26	and that they will want to follow
1008.26	even if that means
1010.26	making hard choices.
1013.26	A final thought:
1015.26	Ending civil wars
1017.26	is a process that is fraught with dangers,
1020.26	frustrations and setbacks.
1023.26	It often takes a generation to accomplish,
1026.26	but it also requires us, today's generation,
1029.26	to take responsibility
1031.26	and to learn the right lessons
1033.26	about leadership, diplomacy
1036.26	and institutional design,
1039.26	so that the child soldiers of today
1042.26	can become the children of tomorrow.
1044.26	Thank you.
1046.26	(Applause)
