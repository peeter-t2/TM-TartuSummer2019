26	I'm going to discuss with you three of my inventions
30	that can have an effect on 10 to a 100 million people,
35	which we will hope to see happen.
38	We discussed, in the prior film, some of the old things that we did,
42	like stents and insulin pumps for the diabetic.
45	And I'd like to talk very briefly about three new inventions
50	that will change the lives of many people.
54	At the present time, it takes an average of three hours
57	after the first symptoms of a heart attack are recognized by the patient,
60	before that patient arrives at an emergency room.
64	And people with silent ischemia --
66	which, translated into English, means they don't have any symptoms --
70	it takes even longer for them to get to the hospital.
73	The AMI, Acute Myocardial Infarction,
77	which is a doctor's big word so they can charge you more money --
80	(Laughter)
82	-- means a heart attack. Annual incidence: 1.2 million Americans.
86	Mortality: 300,000 people dying each year.
90	About half of them, 600,000, have permanent damage to their heart
96	that will cause them to have very bad problems later on.
101	Thus 900,000 people either have died
104	or have significant damage to their heart muscle.
107	Symptoms are often denied by the patient, particularly us men,
111	because we are very brave. We are very brave,
114	and we don't want to admit that I'm having a hell of a chest pain.
118	Then, approximately 25 percent of all patients never have any symptoms.
123	What are we going to do about them? How can we save their lives?
126	It's particularly true of diabetics and elderly women.
130	Well, what is needed for the earliest possible warning of a heart attack?
135	A means to determine if there's a complete blockage of a coronary artery.
139	That, ladies and gentlemen, is a heart attack.
143	The means consist of noting something a little technical,
147	ST segment elevation of the electrogram --
150	translated into English, that means that
153	if there's an electrical signal in the heart, and one part of the ECG --
159	which we call the ST segment -- elevates,
163	that is a sure sign of a heart attack.
165	And if we had a computer put into the body of a person who's at risk,
170	we could know, before they even have symptoms,
173	that they're having a heart attack, to save their life.
176	Well, the doctor can program a level of this ST elevation voltage
182	that will trigger an emergency alarm,
185	vibration like your cell phone, but right by your clavicle bone.
190	And when it goes beep, beep, beep, you better do something about it,
194	because if you want to live you have to get to some medical treatment.
200	So we have to try these devices out
202	because the FDA won't just let us use them on people
205	unless we try it out first,
207	and the best model for this happens to be pigs.
211	And what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin,
216	like you see in an emergency room,
218	and I'm going to show you why they don't work very well.
221	And then we put a lead, which is a wire, in the right ventricle inside the heart,
226	which does the electrogram, which is the signal voltage from inside the heart.
230	Well, with the pig, at the baseline,
233	before we blocked the pig's artery to simulate a heart attack, that was the signal.
238	After 43 seconds, even an expert couldn't tell the difference,
243	and after three minutes -- well,
245	if you really studied it, you'd see a difference.
247	But what happened when we looked inside the pig's heart, to the electrogram?
252	There was the baseline -- first of all, a much bigger and more reliable signal.
257	Second of all, I'll bet even you people who are untrained can see the difference,
262	and we see here an ST segment elevation right after this sharp line.
267	Look at the difference there. It doesn't take much --
271	every layperson could see that difference,
273	and computers can be programmed to easily detect it.
278	Then, look at that after three minutes.
280	We see that the signal that's actually in the heart,
284	we can use it to tell people that they're having a heart attack
288	even before they have symptoms so we can save their life.
292	Then we tried it with my son, Dr. Tim Fischell,
295	we tried it on some human patients who had to have a stent put in.
299	Well, he kept the balloon filled to block the artery,
302	to simulate a blockage, which is what a heart attack is.
305	And it's not hard to see that -- the baseline
308	is the first picture on the upper left.
310	Next to it, at 30 seconds, you see this rise here,
314	then this rise -- that's the ST elevation.
318	And if we had a computer that could detect it,
321	we could tell you you're having a heart attack so early
324	it could save your life and prevent congestive heart failure.
329	And then he did it again. We filled the balloon again a few minutes later
334	and here you see, even after 10 seconds, a great rise in this piece,
338	which we can have computers inside, under your chest like a pacemaker,
343	with a wire into your heart like a pacemaker.
346	And computers don't go to sleep.
348	We have a little battery and on this little battery
352	that computer will run for five years without needing replacement.
356	What does the system look like?
358	Well, on the left is the IMD, which is Implantable Medical Device,
362	and tonight in the tent you can see it -- they've exhibited it.
366	It's about this big, the size of a pacemaker.
369	It's implanted with very conventional techniques.
372	And the EXD is an External Device that you can have on your night table.
376	It'll wake you up and tell you to get your tail to the emergency room
381	when the thing goes off because, if you don't, you're in deep doo-doo.
385	And then, finally, a programmer that will set the level of the stimulation,
390	which is the level which says you are having a heart attack.
395	The FDA says, OK, test this final device after it's built in some animal,
402	which we said is a pig, so we had to get this pig to have a heart attack.
406	And when you go to the farmyard, you can't easily get pigs to have heart attacks,
410	so we said, well, we're experts in stents.
413	Tonight you'll see some of our invented stents.
415	We said, so we'll put in a stent,
418	but we're not going to put in a stent that we'd put in people.
420	We're putting in a copper stent,
422	and this copper stent erodes the artery and causes heart attacks.
426	That's not very nice, but, after all, we had to find out what the answer is.
429	So we took two copper stents and we put it in the artery of this pig,
434	and let me show you the result that's very gratifying
438	as far as people who have heart disease are concerned.
441	So there it was, Thursday morning we stopped the pig's medication
447	and there is his electrogram, the signal from inside the pig's heart
452	coming out by radio telemetry.
454	Then, on Friday at 6:43, he began to get certain signs,
459	which later we had the pig run around --
462	I'm not going to go into this early stage.
465	But look what happened at 10:06 after we removed this pig's medication
471	that kept him from having a heart attack.
473	Any one of you now is an expert on ST elevation. Can you see it there?
478	Can you see it in the picture after the big rise of the QRS -- you see ST elevation?
483	This pig at 10:06 was having a heart attack.
488	What happens after you have the heart attack, this blockage?
492	Your rhythm becomes irregular, and that's what happened 45 minutes later.
499	Then, ventricular fibrillation, the heart quivers instead of beats --
503	this is just before death of the pig -- and then the pig died; it went flat-line.
509	But we had a little bit over an hour where we could've saved this pig's life.
512	Well, because of the FDA, we didn't save the pig's life,
516	because we need to do this type of animal research for humans.
520	But when it comes to the sake of a human, we can save their life.
524	We can save the lives of people who are at high risk for a heart attack.
531	What is the response to acute myocardial infarction, a heart attack, today?
537	Well, you feel some chest pain or indigestion.
540	It's not all that bad; you decide not to do anything.
543	Several hours pass and it gets worse, and even the man won't ignore it.
548	Finally, you go to the emergency room.
551	You wait as burns and other critical patients are treated,
554	because 75 percent of the patients who go to an emergency room with chest pains
559	don't have AMI, so you're not taken very seriously.
563	They finally see you. It takes more time
565	to get your electrocardiogram on your skin and diagnose it,
568	and it's hard to do because they don't have the baseline data,
571	which the computer we put in you gets.
575	Finally, if you're lucky, you are treated in three or four hours after the incident,
578	but the heart muscle has died.
580	And that is the typical treatment in the advanced world -- not Africa --
585	that's the typical treatment in the advanced world today.
589	So we developed the AngelMed Guardian System
592	and we have a device inside this patient, called the Implanted AngelMed Guardian.
596	And when you have a blockage, the alarm goes off
600	and it sends the alarm and the electrogram to an external device,
604	which gets your baseline electrogram from 24 hours ago
607	and the one that caused the alarm, so you can take it to the emergency room
610	and show them, and say, take care of me right away.
614	Then it goes to a network operations center,
617	where they get your data from your patient database
619	that's been put in at some central location, say, in the United States.
624	Then it goes to a diagnostic center, and within one minute of your heart attack,
628	your signal appears on the screen of a computer
632	and the computer analyzes what your problem is.
635	And the person who's there, the medical practitioner, calls you --
639	this is also a cell phone -- and says,
641	"""Mr. Smith, you're in deep doo-doo; you have a problem."
644	We've called the ambulance. The ambulance is on the way.
648	It'll pick you up, and then we're going to call your doctor, tell him about it.
653	We're going to send him the signal that we have, that says you have a heart attack,
657	and we're going to send the signal to the hospital
659	and we're going to have it analyzed there,
662	and there you're going to be with your doctor
664	"and you'll be taken care of so you won't die of a heart attack."""
666	That's the first invention that I wanted to describe.
670	(Applause)
674	And now I want to talk about something entirely different.
677	At first I didn't think migraine headaches were a big problem
681	because I'd never had a migraine headache,
683	but then I spoke to some people who have three or four every week of their life,
688	and their lives are being totally ruined by it.
691	We have a mission statement for our company doing migraine, which is,
695	"""Prevent or ameliorate migraine headaches"
697	by the application of a safe, controlled magnetic pulse
701	"applied, as needed, by the patient."""
704	Now, you're probably very few physicists here.
707	If you're a physicist you'd know there's a certain Faraday's Law,
710	which says if I apply a magnetic pulse on salt water --
715	that's your brains by the way --
717	it'll generate electric currents, and the electric current in the brain
722	can erase a migraine headache.
724	That's what we have discovered.
726	So here's a picture of what we're doing.
729	The patients who have a migraine preceded by an aura
734	have a band of excited neurons -- that's shown in red --
738	that moves at three to five millimeters a minute towards the mid-brain.
743	And when it hits the mid-brain, that's when the headache begins.
748	There's this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura,
753	and this visual aura, by the way -- and I'll show you a picture --
756	but it sort of begins with little dancing lights,
759	gets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field.
762	And what we tried was this; here is a device called the Cadwell Model MES10.
769	Weighs about 70 pounds, has a wire about an inch in diameter.
773	And here's one of the patients who has an aura
776	and always has a headache, bad one, after the aura. What do we do?
782	This is what an aura looks like.
784	It's sort of funny dancing lights, shown there on the left and right side.
788	And that's a fully developed visual aura, as we see on top.
792	In the middle, our experimentalist, the neurologist, who said,
798	"""I'm going to move this down a little and I'm going to erase half your aura."""
801	And, by God, the neurologist did erase it, and that's the middle picture:
806	half of the aura erased by a short magnetic pulse.
809	What does that mean?
811	That means that the magnetic pulse is generating an electric current
815	that's interfering with the erroneous electrical activity in the brain.
820	"And finally he says, ""OK, now I'm going to -- """
822	all of the aura get erased with an appropriately placed magnetic pulse.
827	What is the result? We designed a magnetic depolarizer
831	that looks like this, that you could have -- a lady, in her pocket book --
836	and when you get an aura you can try it and see how it works.
840	Well, the next thing they have to show is what was on ABC News,
844	Channel 7, last week in New York City, in the 11 o'clock news.
848	Anchor: For anyone who suffers from migraine headaches --
850	and there are 30 million Americans who do -- tonight: a possible answer.
854	Eyewitness news reporter Stacy Sager tonight, with a small and portable machine
858	that literally zaps your migraines away.
862	Christina Sidebottom: Well, my first reaction was that it was --
864	looked awfully gun-like, and it was very strange.
868	Stacy Sager: But for Christina Sidebottom, almost anything was worth trying
872	if it could stop a migraine.
874	It may look silly or even frightening as you walk around with it in your purse,
880	but researchers here in Ohio organizing clinical trials for this migraine zapper,
885	say it is scientifically sound --
888	that, in fact, when the average person gets a migraine,
890	it's caused by something similar to an electrical impulse.
894	The zapper creates a magnetic field to counteract that.
898	Yousef Mohammed: In other words, we're treating electricity with electricity,
901	rather than treating electricity with the chemicals that we're using nowadays.
906	SS: But is it safe to use everyday?
908	Experts say the research has actually been around for more than a decade,
912	and more long-term studies need to be done. Christina now swears by it.
917	CS: It's been the most wonderful thing for my migraine.
920	SS: Researchers are hoping to present their studies to the FDA this summer.
924	Robert Fischell: And that is the invention to treat migraines.
926	(Applause)
928	You see, the problem is, 30 million Americans have migraine headaches,
933	and we need a means to treat it, and I think that we now have it.
937	And this is the first device that we did, and I'm going to talk about my second wish,
942	which has something to do with this.
944	Our conclusions from our studies so far, at three research centers,
947	is there is a marked improvement in pain levels after using it just once.
951	The most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times,
956	and the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches,
960	not only those with aura, get treated and get diminished.
964	And auras can be erased and the migraine, then, does not occur.
969	And that is the migraine invention that we are talking about and that we are working on.
976	(Applause)
978	The third and last invention began with an idea.
983	Epilepsy can best be treated by responsive electrical stimulation.
988	Now, why do we use -- add on, nearly, an epileptic focus?
992	Now, unfortunately, us technical people, unlike Mr. Bono,
996	have to get into all these technical words.
998	"Well, ""responsive electrical stimulation"" means"
1003	"that we sense, at a place in your brain which is called an ""epileptic focus,"""
1008	which is where the epileptic seizure begins --
1013	we sense there, that it's going to happen,
1016	and then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot,
1021	which erases the errant signal
1024	so that you don't get the clinical manifestations of the migraine headache.
1029	We use current pacemaker defibrillator technology that's used for the heart.
1034	We thought we could adapt it for the brain.
1036	The device could be implanted under the scalp
1038	to be totally hidden and avoid wire breakage,
1042	which occurs if you put it in the chest and you try to move your neck around.
1046	Form a company to develop a neuro-pacemaker for epilepsy,
1049	as well as other diseases of the brain, because all diseases of the brain
1055	are a result of some electrical malfunction in it,
1059	that causes many, if not all, of brain disorders.
1064	We formed a company called NeuroPace
1068	and we started work on responsive neurostimulation,
1071	and this is a picture of what the device looked like,
1074	that's placed into the cranial bone.
1077	This is probably a better picture.
1079	Here we have our device in which we put in a frame.
1084	There's a cut made in the scalp; it's opened; the neurosurgeon has a template;
1090	he marks it around, and uses a dental burr
1092	to remove a piece of the cranial bone exactly the size of our device.
1097	And tonight, you'll be able to see the device in the tent.
1100	And then with four screws, we put in a frame,
1104	then we snap in the device and we run with wires --
1107	the one shown in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrodes,
1112	to the epileptic focus, the origin of the epilepsy,
1115	where we can sense the electrical signal
1118	and have computer analysis that tells us when to hit it with some electrical current
1123	to prevent the clinical manifestation of the seizure.
1126	In the blue wire, we see what's called a deep brain electrode.
1129	If that's the source of the epilepsy, we can attack that as well.
1134	The comprehensive solution: this is the device;
1137	it's about one inches by two inches and, oddly enough,
1140	just the thickness of most cranial bones.
1144	The advantages of responsive neurostimulation:
1147	It can detect and terminate seizures before the clinical symptoms occur,
1151	provide stimulation only when needed,
1154	can be turned off if seizures disappear; it has minimal side effects --
1159	as a matter of fact, in all our clinical trials to date,
1162	we've seen no side effects in the 40 or so patients in whom it's been implanted --
1167	and it's invisible, cosmetically hidden,
1170	so, if you have epilepsy and you have the device,
1173	no one will know it because you can't tell that it's there.
1176	And this shows what an electroencephalogram is,
1180	and on the left is the signal of a spontaneous seizure of one of the patients.
1184	Then we stimulated, and you see how that heavy black line
1188	and then you see the electroencephalogram signal going to normal,
1192	which means they did not get the epileptic seizure.
1195	That concludes my discussion of epilepsy,
1200	which is the third invention that I want to discuss here this afternoon.
1204	(Applause)
1208	I have three wishes. Well, I can't do much about Africa.
1213	I'm a tech; I'm into medical gadgetry,
1216	which is mostly high-tech stuff like Mr. Bono talked about.
1220	The first wish is to use the epilepsy responsive neurostimulator,
1225	called RNS, for Responsive NeuroStimulator -- that's a brilliant acronym --
1230	for the treatment of other brain disorders.
1232	Well, if we're going to do it for epilepsy, why the hell not try it for something else?
1237	Then you saw what that device looked like,
1240	that the woman was using to fix her migraines?
1242	I tell you this: that's something which some research engineer like me would concoct,
1247	not a real designer of good equipment.
1249	(Laughter)
1251	We want to have some people, who really know how to do this,
1254	perform human engineering studies to develop the optimum design
1258	for the portable device for treating migraine headaches.
1261	And some of the sponsors of this TED meeting are such organizations.
1266	Then we're going to challenge the TED attendees
1269	to come up with a way to improve health care in the USA,
1273	where we have problems that Africa doesn't have.
1276	And by reducing malpractice litigation --
1279	malpractice litigation is not an African problem; it's an American problem.
1283	(Applause)
1286	So, to get quickly to my first wish --
1289	the brain operates by electrical signals.
1292	If the electrical signals create a brain disorder,
1295	electro-stimulation can overcome that disorder by acting on the brain's neurons.
1299	In other words, if you've screwed up electrical signals,
1303	maybe, by putting other electrical signals from a computer in the brain,
1307	we can counteract that.
1310	A signal in the brain that triggers brain dysfunction
1313	might be sensed as a trigger for electro-stimulation
1316	like we're doing with epilepsy.
1318	But even if there is no signal,
1320	electro-stimulation of an appropriate part of the brain can turn off a brain disorder.
1325	And consider treating psychotic disorders --
1329	and I want this involved with the TED group --
1332	such as obsessive-compulsive disorder
1334	that, presently, is not well treated with drugs, and includes five million Americans.
1340	And Mr. Fischer, and his group at NeuroPace, and myself believe
1344	that we can have a dramatic effect in improving OCD in America and in the world.
1350	That is the first wish.
1353	(Applause)
1358	The second wish is, at the present time,
1361	the clinical trials of transcranial magnetic stimulators --
1366	that's what TMS means, device to treat migraine headaches --
1370	appears to be quite successful.
1372	Well, that's the good news.
1374	The present portable device is far from optimally designed,
1376	both as to human factors as appearance.
1379	I think she said it looks like a gun. A lot of people don't like guns.
1383	(Laughter)
1385	Engage a company having prior successes
1387	for human factors engineering and industrial design
1390	to optimize the design of the first portable TMS device
1395	that will be sold to the patients who have migraine headaches.
1398	And that is the second wish.
1400	(Applause)
1405	And, of the 100,000-dollar prize money, that TED was so generous to give me,
1409	I am donating 50,000 dollars to the NeuroPace people
1413	to get on with the treatment of OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder,
1418	and I'm making another 50,000 available for a company
1422	to optimize the design of the device for migraines.
1425	And that's how I'll use my 100,000-dollar prize money.
1429	(Applause)
1435	Well, the third and final wish is somewhat --
1437	unfortunately, it's much more complicated because it involves lawyers.
1442	(Laughter)
1444	Well, medical malpractice litigation in the US
1446	has escalated the cost of malpractice insurance,
1448	so that competent physicians are leaving their practice.
1451	Lawyers take cases on contingency with the hope of a big share
1455	of a big settlement by a sympathetic jury, because this patient really ended up badly.
1460	The high cost of health care in the US is partly due to litigation and insurance costs.
1465	I've seen pictures, graphs in today's USA Today
1470	showing it skyrocketing out of control, and this is one factor.
1473	Well, how can the TED community help with this situation?
1477	I have a couple of ideas to begin with.
1480	As a starting point for discussion with the TED group,
1484	a major part of the problem is the nature of the written extent
1487	of informed consent that the patient or spouse must read and sign.
1491	For example, I asked the epilepsy people
1494	what are they using for informed consent.
1496	Would you believe, 12 pages, single space,
1500	the patient has to read before they're in our trial to cure their epilepsy?
1505	What do you think someone has at the end of reading 12 single-spaced pages?
1509	They don't understand what the hell it's about.
1511	(Laughter)
1513	That's the present system. How about making a video?
1516	We have entertainment people here;
1518	we have people who know how to do videos,
1520	with visual presentation of the anatomy and procedure done with animation.
1524	Everybody knows that we can do better with a visual thing
1529	that can be interactive with the patient, where they see the video
1533	and they're being videoed and they press, do you understand this? No, I don't.
1538	Well, then let's go to a simpler explanation.
1540	Then there's a simpler one and, oh yes, I understand that.
1543	Well, press the button and you're on record, you understand.
1546	And that is one of the ideas.
1549	Now, also a video is done of the patient or spouse and medical presenter,
1552	with the patient agreeing that he understands the procedure to be done,
1557	including all the possible failure modes.
1560	The patient or spouse agrees not to file a lawsuit
1562	if one of the known procedure failures occurs.
1565	Now, in America, in fact, you cannot give up your right to trial by jury.
1571	However, if a video is there that everything was explained to you,
1575	and you have it all in the video file,
1577	it'll be much less likely that some hotshot lawyer
1580	will take this case on contingency, because it won't be nearly as good a case.
1585	If a medical error occurs, the patient or spouse agrees to a settlement
1590	for fair compensation by arbitration instead of going to court.
1595	That would save hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs in the United States
1600	and would decrease the cost of medicine for everyone.
1603	These are just some starting points.
1606	And, so there, that's the end of all my wishes.
1610	I wish I had more wishes but three is what I've got and there they are.
