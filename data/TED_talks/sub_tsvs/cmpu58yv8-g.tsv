12.96	When Dorothy was a little girl,
14.56	she was fascinated by her goldfish.
17.08	Her father explained to her that fish swim
17.08	by quickly wagging their tails
20.56	to propel themselves through the water.
23.04	Without hesitation,
23.04	little Dorothy responded,
25.2	"""Yes, Daddy, and fish swim backwards"
25.2	"by wagging their heads."""
28.48	(Laughter)
30.12	In her mind, it was a fact
30.12	as true as any other.
32.96	Fish swim backwards
32.96	by wagging their heads.
35.32	She believed it.
37.32	Our lives are full
37.32	of fish swimming backwards.
40.32	We make assumptions
40.32	and faulty leaps of logic.
42.84	We harbor bias.
44.119	We know that we are right,
44.119	and they are wrong.
46.4	We fear the worst.
48.04	We strive for unattainable perfection.
50.92	We tell ourselves
50.92	what we can and cannot do.
53.88	In our minds, fish swim by in reverse
53.88	frantically wagging their heads
58	and we don't even notice them.
61.16	I'm going to tell you
61.16	five facts about myself.
63.36	One fact is not true.
65.76	One: I graduated from Harvard at 19
65.76	with an honors degree in mathematics.
71.68	Two: I currently run
71.68	a construction company in Orlando.
76.92	Three: I starred on a television sitcom.
81.44	Four: I lost my sight
81.44	to a rare genetic eye disease.
86.96	Five: I served as a law clerk
86.96	to two US Supreme Court justices.
92.36	Which fact is not true?
95.88	Actually, they're all true.
98.24	Yeah. They're all true.
100.8	(Applause)
104.68	At this point, most people really
104.68	only care about the television show.
108.36	(Laughter)
111.68	I know this from experience.
114.32	OK, so the show was NBC's
114.32	"""Saved by the Bell: The New Class."""
117.68	And I played Weasel Wyzell,
122.24	who was the sort of dorky,
122.24	nerdy character on the show,
126.32	which made it a very
126.32	major acting challenge
131.12	for me as a 13-year-old boy.
132.64	(Laughter)
135.32	Now, did you struggle
135.32	with number four, my blindness?
139.12	Why is that?
141.28	We make assumptions
141.28	about so-called disabilities.
144.28	As a blind man, I confront
144.28	others' incorrect assumptions
147.48	about my abilities every day.
150.64	My point today is not
150.64	about my blindness, however.
153.2	It's about my vision.
155.48	Going blind taught me
155.48	to live my life eyes wide open.
160.2	It taught me to spot
160.2	those backwards-swimming fish
162.6	that our minds create.
164.12	Going blind cast them into focus.
167.76	What does it feel like to see?
170.72	It's immediate and passive.
172.8	You open your eyes and there's the world.
174.96	Seeing is believing. Sight is truth.
177.08	Right?
179.12	Well, that's what I thought.
181.52	Then, from age 12 to 25,
181.52	my retinas progressively deteriorated.
187.28	My sight became an increasingly bizarre
190.32	carnival funhouse hall
190.32	of mirrors and illusions.
193.64	The salesperson I was relieved
193.64	to spot in a store
196	was really a mannequin.
197.88	Reaching down to wash my hands,
199.4	I suddenly saw it was
199.4	a urinal I was touching, not a sink,
202.64	when my fingers felt its true shape.
205.16	A friend described
205.16	the photograph in my hand,
207.32	and only then I could see
207.32	the image depicted.
210.72	Objects appeared, morphed
210.72	and disappeared in my reality.
216.08	It was difficult and exhausting to see.
219.6	I pieced together fragmented,
219.6	transitory images,
222.88	consciously analyzed the clues,
224.88	searched for some logic
224.88	in my crumbling kaleidoscope,
228.84	until I saw nothing at all.
231.6	I learned that what we see
233.28	is not universal truth.
236.2	It is not objective reality.
240	What we see is a unique,
240	personal, virtual reality
244.72	that is masterfully
244.72	constructed by our brain.
247.56	Let me explain with a bit
247.56	of amateur neuroscience.
249.918	Your visual cortex takes up
249.918	about 30 percent of your brain.
253.56	That's compared to approximately
253.56	eight percent for touch
257.04	and two to three percent for hearing.
259.6	Every second, your eyes
259.6	can send your visual cortex
263.36	as many as two billion
263.36	pieces of information.
266.36	The rest of your body can send your brain
266.36	only an additional billion.
270.68	So sight is one third
270.68	of your brain by volume
274.92	and can claim about two thirds
274.92	of your brain's processing resources.
279.04	It's no surprise then
280.28	that the illusion
280.28	of sight is so compelling.
282.4	But make no mistake about it:
282.4	sight is an illusion.
285.92	Here's where it gets interesting.
287.76	To create the experience of sight,
289.88	your brain references your conceptual
289.88	understanding of the world,
293.44	other knowledge, your memories,
293.44	opinions, emotions, mental attention.
297.52	All of these things and far more
297.52	are linked in your brain to your sight.
303.04	These linkages work both ways,
303.04	and usually occur subconsciously.
306.48	So for example,
308.36	what you see impacts how you feel,
310.52	and the way you feel
310.52	can literally change what you see.
314.04	Numerous studies demonstrate this.
316.6	If you are asked to estimate
318.48	the walking speed of a man
318.48	in a video, for example,
321.68	your answer will be different if you're
321.68	told to think about cheetahs or turtles.
327.12	A hill appears steeper
327.12	if you've just exercised,
330.44	and a landmark appears farther away
332.68	if you're wearing a heavy backpack.
335.96	We have arrived
335.96	at a fundamental contradiction.
340.16	What you see is a complex
340.16	mental construction of your own making,
344.6	but you experience it passively
346.4	as a direct representation
346.4	of the world around you.
349.68	You create your own reality,
349.68	and you believe it.
353.56	I believed mine until it broke apart.
356.92	The deterioration of my eyes
356.92	shattered the illusion.
360.72	You see, sight is just one way
363.04	we shape our reality.
365.28	We create our own realities
365.28	in many other ways.
369.16	Let's take fear as just one example.
373.44	Your fears distort your reality.
377.88	Under the warped logic of fear,
377.88	anything is better than the uncertain.
382.08	Fear fills the void at all costs,
384.56	passing off what you dread
384.56	for what you know,
386.72	offering up the worst
386.72	in place of the ambiguous,
389.52	substituting assumption for reason.
392.12	Psychologists have
392.12	a great term for it: awfulizing.
394.88	(Laughter)
396	Right?
397.56	Fear replaces the unknown with the awful.
402.08	Now, fear is self-realizing.
404	When you face the greatest need
405.76	to look outside yourself
405.76	and think critically,
408.44	fear beats a retreat
408.44	deep inside your mind,
411.28	shrinking and distorting your view,
413.08	drowning your capacity
413.08	for critical thought
415.16	with a flood of disruptive emotions.
417.88	When you face a compelling
417.88	opportunity to take action,
420.76	fear lulls you into inaction,
423.28	enticing you to passively watch
423.28	its prophecies fulfill themselves.
429.88	When I was diagnosed
429.88	with my blinding disease,
432.12	I knew blindness would ruin my life.
436.4	Blindness was a death sentence
436.4	for my independence.
439.36	It was the end of achievement for me.
442.6	Blindness meant I would live
442.6	an unremarkable life,
446.6	small and sad,
448.32	and likely alone.
450.28	I knew it.
453.44	This was a fiction born of my fears,
453.44	but I believed it.
456.8	It was a lie, but it was my reality,
459.44	just like those backwards-swimming fish
459.44	in little Dorothy's mind.
463.92	If I had not confronted
463.92	the reality of my fear,
466.44	I would have lived it.
468.2	I am certain of that.
471.92	So how do you live your life
471.92	eyes wide open?
475.48	It is a learned discipline.
477.52	It can be taught. It can be practiced.
480.68	I will summarize very briefly.
483.64	Hold yourself accountable
485.56	for every moment, every thought,
488.08	every detail.
490.12	See beyond your fears.
491.8	Recognize your assumptions.
493.56	Harness your internal strength.
495.36	Silence your internal critic.
497.56	Correct your misconceptions
497.56	about luck and about success.
501.48	Accept your strengths and your weaknesses,
501.48	and understand the difference.
505.6	Open your hearts
506.92	to your bountiful blessings.
509.48	Your fears, your critics,
511.72	your heroes, your villains --
513.6	they are your excuses,
516.64	rationalizations, shortcuts,
519	justifications, your surrender.
522.36	They are fictions you perceive as reality.
526	Choose to see through them.
527.679	Choose to let them go.
530.08	You are the creator of your reality.
534.24	With that empowerment
534.24	comes complete responsibility.
538.44	I chose to step out of fear's tunnel
538.44	into terrain uncharted and undefined.
544.44	I chose to build there a blessed life.
548.12	Far from alone,
549.92	I share my beautiful life with Dorothy,
552.92	my beautiful wife,
554.6	with our triplets,
554.6	whom we call the Tripskys,
558.4	and with the latest addition
558.4	to the family,
560.44	sweet baby Clementine.
562.84	What do you fear?
565.6	What lies do you tell yourself?
568.52	How do you embellish your truth
568.52	and write your own fictions?
572.36	What reality are you
572.36	creating for yourself?
576.2	In your career and personal life,
576.2	in your relationships,
579.4	and in your heart and soul,
581.04	your backwards-swimming fish
581.04	do you great harm.
584.56	They exact a toll in missed opportunities
584.56	and unrealized potential,
589.4	and they engender insecurity and distrust
591.8	where you seek fulfillment and connection.
595.56	I urge you to search them out.
599.36	Helen Keller said that the only thing
599.36	worse than being blind
603.56	is having sight but no vision.
606.92	For me, going blind
606.92	was a profound blessing,
610.72	because blindness gave me vision.
613.72	I hope you can see what I see.
616.28	Thank you.
617.52	(Applause)
632.72	Bruno Giussani: Isaac, before you
632.72	leave the stage, just a question.
635.92	This is an audience of entrepreneurs,
635.92	of doers, of innovators.
639.72	You are a CEO of a company
639.72	down in Florida,
643.4	and many are probably wondering,
645.56	how is it to be a blind CEO?
647.8	What kind of specific challenges
647.8	do you have, and how do you overcome them?
651.6	Isaac Lidsky: Well,
651.6	the biggest challenge became a blessing.
654.76	I don't get visual feedback from people.
657.88	(Laughter)
660	BG: What's that noise there? IL: Yeah.
662.2	So, for example,
662.2	in my leadership team meetings,
665.72	I don't see facial
665.72	expressions or gestures.
669.64	I've learned to solicit
669.64	a lot more verbal feedback.
673.4	I basically force people
673.4	to tell me what they think.
678.08	And in this respect,
679.96	it's become, like I said, a real blessing
679.96	for me personally and for my company,
684.08	because we communicate
684.08	at a far deeper level,
687.4	we avoid ambiguities,
690.08	and most important, my team knows
690.08	that what they think truly matters.
698.56	BG: Isaac, thank you for coming to TED.
698.56	IL: Thank you, Bruno.
701.48	(Applause)
