13.178	How much do you get paid?
15.155	Don't answer that out loud.
17.666	But put a number in your head.
20.017	Now: How much do you think the person
20.017	sitting next to you gets paid?
25.176	Again, don't answer out loud.
27.359	(Laughter)
29.144	At work, how much do you think
31.526	the person sitting in the cubicle
31.526	or the desk next to you gets paid?
35.488	Do you know?
36.977	Should you know?
38.961	Notice, it's a little uncomfortable for me
38.961	to even ask you those questions.
42.962	But admit it -- you kind of want to know.
46.993	Most of us are uncomfortable with the idea
46.993	of broadcasting our salary.
50.542	We're not supposed to tell our neighbors,
52.715	and we're definitely not supposed
52.715	to tell our office neighbors.
55.931	The assumed reason is that if everybody
55.931	knew what everybody got paid,
59.469	then all hell would break loose.
61.283	There'd be arguments, there'd be fights,
63.408	there might even be a few people who quit.
65.621	But what if secrecy is actually
65.621	the reason for all that strife?
69.424	And what would happen
69.424	if we removed that secrecy?
72.599	What if openness actually increased
72.599	the sense of fairness and collaboration
76.614	inside a company?
77.86	What would happen if we had
77.86	total pay transparency?
82.254	For the past several years,
83.595	I've been studying the corporate
83.595	and entrepreneurial leaders
86.532	who question the conventional wisdom
86.532	about how to run a company.
90.105	And the question of pay keeps coming up.
93.105	And the answers keep surprising.
96.458	It turns out that pay transparency --
98.289	sharing salaries openly
98.289	across a company --
100.423	makes for a better workplace
100.423	for both the employee
103.096	and for the organization.
105.362	When people don't know how their pay
105.362	compares to their peers',
108.485	they're more likely to feel underpaid
110.325	and maybe even discriminated against.
112.646	Do you want to work at a place
112.646	that tolerates the idea
115.245	that you feel underpaid
115.245	or discriminated against?
118.697	But keeping salaries secret
118.697	does exactly that,
121.231	and it's a practice
121.231	as old as it is common,
124.674	despite the fact
124.674	that in the United States,
126.79	the law protects an employee's right
126.79	to discuss their pay.
131.417	In one famous example from decades ago,
133.999	the management of Vanity Fair magazine
136.129	actually circulated a memo entitled:
138.273	"""Forbidding Discussion Among"
138.273	"Employees of Salary Received."""
141.502	"""Forbidding"" discussion among"
141.502	employees of salary received.
145.482	Now that memo didn't sit well
145.482	with everybody.
147.653	New York literary figures
147.653	Dorothy Parker,
149.723	Robert Benchley and Robert Sherwood,
151.509	all writers in the Algonquin Round Table,
153.974	decided to stand up for transparency
155.779	and showed up for work the next day
157.535	with their salary written on signs
157.535	hanging from their neck.
160.773	(Laughter)
162.716	Imagine showing up for work
164.315	with your salary just written
164.315	across your chest for all to see.
169.573	But why would a company even want
169.573	to discourage salary discussions?
172.867	Why do some people go along with it,
172.867	while others revolt against it?
177.906	It turns out that in addition
177.906	to the assumed reasons,
180.974	pay secrecy is actually a way
180.974	to save a lot of money.
184.301	You see, keeping salaries secret
186.236	leads to what economists call
186.236	"""information asymmetry."""
189.211	This is a situation where,
189.211	in a negotiation,
191.506	one party has loads more
191.506	information than the other.
194.887	And in hiring or promotion
194.887	or annual raise discussions,
198.321	an employer can use that secrecy
198.321	to save a lot of money.
202.518	Imagine how much better
202.518	you could negotiate for a raise
205.166	if you knew everybody's salary.
209.612	Economists warn that information asymmetry
212.077	can cause markets to go awry.
213.748	Someone leaves a pay stub on the copier,
215.678	and suddenly everybody
215.678	is shouting at each other.
218.866	In fact, they even warn
220.596	that information asymmetry
220.596	can lead to a total market failure.
226.095	And I think we're almost there.
228.133	Here's why:
229.323	first, most employees have no idea
229.323	how their pay compares to their peers'.
234.834	In a 2015 survey of 70,000 employees,
238.708	two-thirds of everyone who is paid
238.708	at the market rate
242.113	said that they felt they were underpaid.
245.036	And of everybody who felt
245.036	that they were underpaid,
	that they intended to quit,
250.916	regardless of where they were --
250.916	underpaid, overpaid
253.828	or right at the market rate.
256.2	If you were part of this survey,
256.2	what would you say?
258.684	Are you underpaid?
259.984	Well, wait -- how do you even know,
262.333	because you're not allowed
262.333	to talk about it?
264.911	Next, information asymmetry, pay secrecy,
268.534	makes it easier to ignore
268.534	the discrimination
271.337	that's already present
271.337	in the market today.
274.217	In a 2011 report from the Institute
274.217	for Women's Policy Research,
277.938	the gender wage gap
277.938	between men and women
280.086	was 23 percent.
282.451	This is where that 77 cents
282.451	on the dollar comes from.
285.641	But in the Federal Government,
287.128	where salaries are pinned
287.128	to certain levels
289.215	and everybody knows
289.215	what those levels are,
291.279	the gender wage gap
291.279	shrinks to 11 percent --
293.388	and this is before controlling
293.388	for any of the factors
295.988	that economists argue over
295.988	whether or not to control for.
299.264	If we really want to close
299.264	the gender wage gap,
301.96	maybe we should start
301.96	by opening up the payroll.
304.864	If this is what total
304.864	market failure looks like,
308.11	then openness remains
308.11	the only way to ensure fairness.
312.274	Now, I realize that letting people
312.274	know what you make
314.799	might feel uncomfortable,
316.469	but isn't it less uncomfortable
318.008	than always wondering
318.008	if you're being discriminated against,
320.912	or if your wife or your daughter
320.912	or your sister is being paid unfairly?
325.353	Openness remains the best way
325.353	to ensure fairness,
329.317	and pay transparency does that.
331.991	That's why entrepreneurial leaders
331.991	and corporate leaders
334.695	have been experimenting
334.695	with sharing salaries for years.
337.512	Like Dane Atkinson.
338.949	Dane is a serial entrepreneur
338.949	who started many companies
342.852	in a pay secrecy condition
344.458	and even used that condition
344.458	to pay two equally qualified people
347.835	dramatically different salaries,
349.555	depending on how well
349.555	they could negotiate.
352.091	And Dane saw the strife
352.091	that happened as a result of this.
355.888	So when he started
355.888	his newest company, SumAll,
358.139	he committed to salary transparency
358.139	from the beginning.
361.821	And the results have been amazing.
364.424	And in study after study,
366.07	when people know
366.07	how they're being paid
367.97	and how that pay compares to their peers',
370.023	they're more likely to work hard
370.023	to improve their performance,
372.98	more likely to be engaged,
372.98	and they're less likely to quit.
375.853	That's why Dane's not alone.
377.279	From technology start-ups like Buffer,
379.915	to the tens of thousands
379.915	of employees at Whole Foods,
383.285	where not only is your salary
383.285	available for everyone to see,
386.476	but the performance data
386.476	for the store and for your department
389.5	is available on the company intranet
391.443	for all to see.
393.985	Now, pay transparency
393.985	takes a lot of forms.
396.471	It's not one size fits all.
398.093	Some post their salaries for all to see.
400.613	Some only keep it inside the company.
402.938	Some post the formula for calculating pay,
405.547	and others post the pay levels
407.345	and affix everybody to that level.
409.147	So you don't have to make signs
411.22	for all of your employees
411.22	to wear around the office.
413.768	And you don't have to be
413.768	the only one wearing a sign
416.706	that you made at home.
418.494	But we can all take greater steps
418.494	towards pay transparency.
422.233	For those of you that have the authority
424.285	to move forward towards transparency:
426.103	it's time to move forward.
427.943	And for those of you
427.943	that don't have that authority:
430.435	it's time to stand up for your right to.
433.263	So how much do you get paid?
436.186	And how does that compare
436.186	to the people you work with?
439.19	You should know.
441.312	And so should they.
443.936	Thank you.
445.128	(Applause)
