12.917	Guatemala is recovering from
12.917	a 36-year armed conflict.
16.085	A conflict that was fought
16.085	during the Cold War.
18.616	It was really just 
18.616	a small leftist insurgency
22.669	and a devastating response by the state.
25.836	What we have as a result
25.836	is 200,000 civilian victims,
	killed in the communities:
32.332	small children, men, women, 
32.332	the elderly even.
36.428	And then we have 
36.428	about 40,000 others, the missing,
39.858	the ones we're still looking for today.
42.178	We call them the Desaparecidos.
44.738	Now, 83 percent of the victims 
44.738	are Mayan victims,
47.603	victims that are the descendants
50.008	of the original inhabitants of 
50.008	Central America.
52.744	And only about 17 percent are of 
52.744	European descent.
56.251	But the most important thing here is that
58.308	the very people who are supposed to 
58.308	defend us, the police, the military,
64.329	are the ones that committed
64.329	most of the crimes.
68.035	Now the families,
68.035	they want information.
71.335	They want to know what happened.
72.902	They want the bodies of their loved ones.
75.092	But most of all,
75.092	what they want is they want you,
78.339	they want everyone to know
78.339	that their loved ones did nothing wrong.
83.515	Now, my case was that my father
83.515	received death threats in 1980.
89.203	And we left.
90.583	We left Guatemala and we came here.
92.337	So I grew up in New York,
93.543	I grew up in Brooklyn as a matter of fact,
93.543	and I went to New Utrecht High School
97.323	and I graduated from Brooklyn College.
99.141	The only thing was that
100.707	I really didn't know what 
100.707	was happening in Guatemala.
104.578	I didn't care for it; it was too painful.
107.447	But it wasn't till 1995 that I decided
107.447	to do something about it.
111.754	So I went back.
112.908	I went back to Guatemala, 
112.908	to look for the bodies,
116.488	to understand what happened
116.488	and to look for part of myself as well.
122.051	The way we work is that
122.051	we give people information.
125.414	We talk to the family members
125.414	and we let them choose.
128.384	We let them decide to tell
128.384	us the stories,
131.614	to tell us what they saw,
133.466	to tell us about their loved ones.
135.594	And even more important,
136.88	we let them choose to
136.88	give us a piece of themselves.
140.878	A piece, an essence, of who they are.
143.354	And that DNA is what we're 
143.354	going to compare
145.611	to the DNA that comes
145.611	from the skeletons.
148.331	While we're doing that, though,
148.331	we're looking for the bodies.
151.386	And these are skeletons by now,
153.374	most of these crimes 
153.374	happened 32 years ago.
156.28	When we find the grave,
157.526	we take out the dirt and eventually clean 
157.526	the body, document it, and exhume it.
161.656	We literally bring the 
161.656	skeleton out of the ground.
165.095	Once we have those bodies, though,
165.095	we take them back to the city, to our lab,
169.237	and we begin a process of trying
169.237	to understand mainly two things:
172.321	One is how people died.
174.614	So here you see a gunshot
174.614	wound to the back of the head
177.718	or a machete wound, for example.
180.367	The other thing we want to understand
180.367	is who they are.
183.693	Whether it's a baby,
187.152	or an adult.
188.809	Whether it's a woman or a man.
190.949	But when we're done
190.949	with that analysis
192.732	what we'll do is we'll take a small 
192.732	fragment of the bone
195.458	and we'll extract DNA from it.
198.272	We'll take that DNA
199.367	and then we'll compare it with the
199.367	DNA of the families, of course.
204.127	The best way to explain this to you
204.127	is by showing you two cases.
207.771	The first is the case 
207.771	of the military diary.
210.318	Now this is a document that was smuggled
210.318	out of somewhere in 1999.
214.993	And what you see there
214.993	is the state following individuals,
219.673	people that, like you, 
219.673	wanted to change their country,
223.604	and they jotted everything down.
226.484	And one of the things that they wrote 
226.484	down is when they executed them.
230.734	Inside that yellow rectangle, 
230.734	you see a code,
233.715	it's a secret code: 300.
236.026	And then you see a date.
237.523	"The 300 means ""executed"" and the date "
237.523	means when they were executed.
241.196	Now that's going to come
241.196	into play in a second.
245.064	What we did is we conducted
245.064	an exhumation in 2003,
248.689	where we exhumed 220 bodies
248.689	from 53 graves in a military base.
254.64	Grave 9, though, matched the family
254.64	of Sergio Saul Linares.
258.635	Now Sergio was a professor
258.635	at the university.
261.361	He graduted from Iowa State University
263.752	and went back to Guatemala
263.752	to change his country.
266.129	And he was captured on 
266.129	February 23, 1984.
270.003	And if you can see there, he was 
270.003	executed on March 29, 1984,
274.092	which was incredible.
275.658	We had the body, we had the family's 
275.658	information and their DNA,
278.68	and now we have documents
278.68	that told us exactly what happened.
282.026	But most important is about
282.026	two weeks later,
285.129	we go another hit, another match
287.816	from the same grave to Amancio Villatoro.
292.617	The DNA of that body
292.617	also matched the DNA of that family.
295.363	And then we noticed
295.363	that he was also in the diary.
298.732	But it was amazing to see that he was 
298.732	also executed on March 29, 1984.
303.903	So that led us to think, hmm, 
303.903	how many bodies were in the grave?
308.226	Six.
309.413	So then we said, how many people
309.413	were executed on March 29, 1984?
318.716	That's right, six as well.
321.034	So we have Juan de Dios, Hugo,
321.034	Moises and Zoilo.
326.726	All of them executed on the same date, 
326.726	all captured at different locations
330.574	and at different moments.
332.328	All put in that grave.
333.492	The only thing we needed now
333.492	was the DNA of those four families
336.636	So we went and we looked for them
336.636	and we found them.
339.881	And we identified those six bodies
339.881	and gave them back to the families.
344.344	The other case I want to tell you about
346.783	is that of a military base 
346.783	called CREOMPAZ.
350.871	"It actually means, ""to believe in peace,"""
350.871	but the acronym really means
355.482	Regional Command Center
355.482	for Peacekeeping Operations.
358.501	And this is where the Guatemalan military
358.501	trains peacekeepers from other countries,
363.491	the ones that serve with the U.N.
366.332	and go to countries
366.332	like Haiti and the Congo.
369.095	Well, we have testimony that said that
369.095	within this military base,
372.608	there were bodies, there were graves.
374.713	So we went in there with a search warrant
374.713	and about two hours after we went in,
378.568	we found the first of 84 graves, 
378.568	a total of 533 bodies.
384.192	Now, if you think about that,
386.829	peacekeepers being trained
386.829	on top of bodies.
390.166	It's very ironic.
393.545	But the bodies -- face down, most of them,
393.545	hands tied behind their backs,
398.802	blindfolded, all types of trauma --
401.426	these were people who were defenseless
401.426	who were being executed.
404.505	People that 533 families are looking for.
408.53	So we're going to focus on Grave 15.
411.142	Grave 15, what we noticed,
411.142	was a grave full of women and children,
417.041	And that immediately made us think,
420.269	my goodness, where is there
420.269	a case like this?
422.544	When I got to Guatemala in 1995,
425.237	I heard of a case of a massacre
425.237	that happened on May 14, 1982,
429.888	where the army came in, killed the men,
433.021	and took the women and children 
433.021	in helicopters to an unknown location.
438.026	Well, guess what?
438.968	The clothing from this grave matched the 
438.968	clothing from the region
443.161	where these people were taken from,
444.891	where these women and children 
444.891	were taken from.
447.274	So we conducted some DNA analysis,
447.274	and guess what?
450.767	We identified Martina Rojas 
450.767	and Manuel Chen.
453.034	Both of them disappeared in that case,
453.034	and now we could prove it.
456.109	We have physical evidence that
456.109	proves that this happened
459.119	and that those people 
459.119	were taken to this base.
461.86	Now, Manuel Chen was three years old.
465.118	His mother went to the river to wash 
465.118	clothes, and she left him with a neighbor.
469.985	That's when the army came
471.689	and that's when he was taken away in 
471.689	a helicopter and never seen again
475.029	until we found him in Grave 15.
477.008	So now with science, with archaeology, 
477.008	with anthropology, with genetics,
482.726	what we're doing is, we're
482.726	giving a voice to the voiceless.
485.96	But we're doing more than that.
487.645	We're actually providing 
487.645	evidence for trials,
489.81	like the genocide trial that happened 
489.81	last year in Guatemala
493.332	where General RÃ­os Montt was found guilty
493.332	of genocide and sentenced to 80 years.
498.142	So I came here to tell you today
498.142	that this is happening everywhere --
501.787	it's happening in Mexico
501.787	right in front of us today --
504.511	and we can't let it go on anymore.
506.451	We have to now come together and decide
509.352	that we're not going to have 
509.352	any more missing.
511.573	So no more missing, guys.
512.765	Okay? No more missing.
515.476	Thank you.
516.719	(Applause)
