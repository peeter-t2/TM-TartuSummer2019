15.879	On March 14, this year,
18.678	I posted this poster on Facebook.
21.558	This is an image of me and my daughter
23.983	holding the Israeli flag.
26.763	I will try to explain to you about the context of why
29.802	and when I posted.
32.408	A few days ago, I was sitting waiting
35.529	on the line at the grocery store,
37.833	and the owner and one of the clients
41.119	were talking to each other,
42.809	and the owner was explaining to the client
44.867	that we're going to get 10,000 missiles on Israel.
48.343	And the client was saying, no, it's 10,000 a day.
53.056	(Laughter)
55.717	"(""10,000 missiles"") This is the context. This is where we are now in Israel."
60.718	We have this war with Iran coming for 10 years now,
64.306	and we have people, you know, afraid.
67.681	It's like every year it's the last minute
71.244	that we can do something about the war with Iran.
73.719	It's like, if we don't act now, it's too late forever,
77.391	for 10 years now.
79.643	So at some point it became, you know, to me,
82.04	I'm a graphic designer, so I made posters about it
85.09	and I posted the one I just showed you before.
89.065	Most of the time, I make posters, I post them on Facebook,
92.127	my friends like it, don't like it,
93.784	most of the time don't like it, don't share it,
95.515	don't nothing,
97.738	and it's another day.
99.731	So I went to sleep, and that was it for me.
103.683	And later on in the night, I woke up
106.599	because I'm always waking up in the night,
108.432	and I went by the computer and I see all these red dots,
111.007	you know, on Facebook, which I've never seen before.
114.159	(Laughter)
115.242	"And I was like, ""What's going on?"""
117.579	So I come to the computer and I start looking on,
121.083	and suddenly I see many people talking to me,
124.108	most of them I don't know,
126.471	and a few of them from Iran,
129.056	which is -- What?
132.537	Because you have to understand,
135.154	in Israel we don't talk with people from Iran.
138.808	We don't know people from Iran.
140.778	It's like, on Facebook, you have friends only from --
145.143	it's like your neighbors are your friends on Facebook.
148.597	And now people from Iran are talking to me.
151.334	So I start answering this girl, and she's telling me
154.843	she saw the poster and she asked her family to come,
159.703	because they don't have a computer, she asked her family
161.319	to come to see the poster, and they're all sitting in the living room crying.
165.867	So I'm like, whoa.
167.549	I ask my wife to come, and I tell her, you have to see that.
170.967	People are crying, and she came, she read the text,
174.016	and she started to cry.
176.716	And everybody's crying now. (Laughter)
179.354	So I don't know what to do, so my first reflex,
182.154	as a graphic designer, is, you know, to show everybody
185.468	what I'd just seen, and people started to see them
189.166	and to share them, and that's how it started.
191.766	The day after, when really it became a lot of talking,
195.505	I said to myself, and my wife said to me,
197.728	I also want a poster,
198.994	so this is her. (Laughter)
202.456	Because it's working, put me in a poster now.
207.438	But more seriously, I was like, okay, these ones work,
210.548	but it's not just about me, it's about people from Israel
213.846	who want to say something.
214.749	So I'm going to shoot all the people I know, if they want,
217.586	and I'm going to put them in a poster and I'm going to share them.
219.674	So I went to my neighbors and friends and students
223.356	and I just asked them, give me a picture, I will make you a poster.
227.447	And that's how it started. And that's how, really,
230.344	it's unleashed, because suddenly people
233.757	from Facebook, friends and others,
236.207	just understand that they can be part of it.
239.164	It's not just one dude making one poster,
240.898	it's -- we can be part of it, so they start sending me pictures
244.411	"and ask me, ""Make me a poster. Post it."
246.787	"Tell the Iranians we from Israel love you too."""
251.421	It became, you know, at some point it was really, really intense.
254.789	I mean, so many pictures, so I asked friends
259.104	to come, graphic designers most of them,
262.227	to make posters with me, because I didn't have the time.
264.83	It was a huge amount of pictures.
267.486	So for a few days, that's how my living room was.
270.881	And we received Israeli posters, Israeli images,
275.404	but also lots of comments, lots of messages from Iran.
280.09	And we took these messages and we made posters out of it,
283.772	because I know people: They don't read, they see images.
287.237	If it's an image, they may read it.
290.213	So here are a few of them.
292.93	"(""You are my first Israelian friend. I wish we both get rid of our idiot politicians, anyway nice to see you!"")"
295.203	"(""I love that blue. I love that star. I love that flag."") This one is really moving for me because it's the story"
298.739	of a girl who has been raised in Iran
302.553	to walk on an Israeli flag to enter her school every morning,
307.831	and now that she sees the posters that we're sending,
311.162	she starts -- she said that she changed her mind,
313.837	and now she loves that blue, she loves that star,
317.178	and she loves that flag, talking about the Israeli flag,
319.513	and she wished that we'd meet and come to visit one another,
323.333	and just a few days after I posted the first poster.
328.416	The day after,
331.028	Iranians started to respond with their own posters.
333.745	They have graphic designers. What? (Laughter)
337.171	Crazy, crazy.
339.513	So you can see they are still shy, they don't want to show their faces,
343.038	but they want to spread the message.
344.61	They want to respond. They want to say the same thing.
346.746	So. And now it's communication.
349.851	It's a two-way story. It's Israelis and Iranians
353.277	sending the same message, one to each other.
355.933	"(""My Israeli Friends. I don't hate you. I don't want War."")"
357.611	This never happened before, and this is two people
361.771	supposed to be enemies, we're on the verge of a war,
364.688	and suddenly people on Facebook are starting to say,
367.307	"""I like this guy. I love those guys."""
371.458	And it became really big at some point.
375.896	And then it became news.
379.208	Because when you're seeing the Middle East, you see only the bad news.
383.408	And suddenly, there is something that was happening
385.707	that was good news. So the guys on the news,
388.533	"they say, ""Okay, let's talk about this."""
390.221	And they just came, and it was so much,
393.42	I remember one day, Michal,
395.859	she was talking with the journalist, and she was asking him,
398.659	"""Who's gonna see the show?""And he said, ""Everybody."""
402.717	"So she said, ""Everybody in Palestine, in where? Israel?"
408.214	"Who is everybody?""""Everybody."""
411.13	"They said, ""Syria?"" ""Syria."""
412.744	"""Lebanon?""""Lebanon."""
414.484	"At some point, he just said, ""40 million people are going to see you today."
418.455	"It's everybody."" The Chinese."
421.167	And we were just at the beginning of the story.
426.793	Something crazy also happened.
428.875	Every time a country started talking about it,
432.063	like Germany, America, wherever,
435.332	a page on Facebook popped up with the same logo
440.76	with the same stories, so at the beginning
442.517	"we had ""Iran-Loves-Israel,"" which is an Iranian"
446.332	"sitting in Tehran, saying, ""Okay, Israel loves Iran?"
451.41	"I give you Iran-Loves-Israel."""
453.32	You have Palestine-Loves-Israel.
454.922	You have Lebanon that just -- a few days ago.
457.55	And this whole list of pages on Facebook
461.018	dedicated to the same message,
463.118	to people sending their love, one to each other.
468.955	The moment I really understood that something was happening,
472.651	a friend of mine told me,
475.101	"""Google the word 'Israel.'"""
477.103	And those were the first images on those days
480.81	that popped up from Google
483.089	"when you were typing, ""Israel"" or ""Iran."""
486.695	We really changed how people see the Middle East.
491.009	Because you're not in the Middle East.
492.778	You're somewhere over there, and then you want to see the Middle East,
495.069	"so you go on Google and you say, ""Israel,"""
496.725	and they give you the bad stuff.
497.934	And for a few days you got those images.
502.703	Today the Israel-Loves-Iran page
505.102	is this number, 80,831, and two million people last week
510.49	went on the page and shared, liked, I don't know,
513.353	commented on one of the photos.
515.945	So for five months now, that's what we are doing,
520.453	me, Michal, a few of my friends, are just making images.
525.203	We're showing a new reality
527.49	by just making images
529.693	because that's how the world perceives us.
532.59	They see images of us, and they see bad images.
535.391	So we're working on making good images. End of story.
540.442	Look at this one. This is the Iran-Loves-Israel page.
545.357	This is not the Israel-Loves-Iran. This is not my page.
547.875	This is a guy in Tehran on the day of remembrance
551.654	of the Israeli fallen soldier
554.196	putting an image of an Israeli soldier on his page.
558.159	This is the enemy.
561.55	What?
563.022	"(""Our heartfelt condolences to the families who lost their dearests in terror attack in Bulgaria"")"
565.064	And it's going both ways.
566.769	It's like, we are showing respect, one to each other.
571.307	And we're understanding. And you show compassion.
576.293	And you become friends.
581.054	And at some point, you become friends on Facebook,
584.281	and you become friends in life.
586.058	You can go and travel and meet people.
588.874	And I was in Munich a few weeks ago.
592.252	I went there to open an exposition about Iran
596.079	and I met there with people from the page
598.536	"that told me, ""Okay, you're going to be in Europe,"
600.842	I'm coming. I'm coming from France, from Holland,
603.446	"from Germany,"" of course, and from Israel people came,"
606.167	and we just met there for the first time in real life.
610.742	I met with people that are supposed to be my enemies
615.259	for the first time. And we just shake hands,
617.873	and have a coffee and a nice discussion,
619.876	and we talk about food and basketball.
622.596	And that was the end of it.
624.334	Remember that image from the beginning?
627.088	At some point we met in real life, and we became friends.
635.469	And it goes the other way around.
638.133	Some girl that we met on Facebook
640.926	never been in Israel, born and raised in Iran,
643.836	lives in Germany, afraid of Israelis
647.394	because of what she knows about us,
649.624	decides after a few months of talking on the Internet
653.238	with some Israelis to come to Israel,
656.282	and she gets on the plane and arrives at Ben Gurion
660.779	"and says, ""Okay, not that big a deal."""
666.906	So a few weeks ago, the stress is getting higher,
670.493	so we start this new campaign
672.966	"called ""Not ready to die in your war."""
676.338	I mean, it's plus/minus the same message,
679.151	but we wanted really to add some aggressivity to it.
682.825	And again, something amazing happened,
685.776	something that we didn't have on the first wave of the campaign.
689.114	Now people from Iran, the same ones who were shy
693.384	at the first campaign and just sent, you know,
695.489	their foot and half their faces,
697.677	now they're sending their faces, and they're saying,
700.077	"""Okay, no problem, we're into it. We are with you."""
709.142	Just read where those guys are from.
712.662	And for every guy from Israel,
714.977	you've got someone from Iran.
726.344	Just people sending their pictures.
746.391	Crazy, yes?
748.574	So --
750.21	(Applause)
759.467	So you may ask yourself, who is this dude?
766.864	My name is Ronny Edry, and I'm 41, I'm an Israeli,
770.518	I'm a father of two, I'm a husband,
774.798	and I'm a graphic designer. I'm teaching graphic design.
779.778	And I'm not that naive, because a lot of the time
783.546	"I've been asked, many times I've been asked, ""Yeah, but,"
786.929	"this is really naive, sending flowers over, I mean — """
790.155	I was in the army. I was in the paratroopers for three years,
794.206	and I know how it looks from the ground.
797.756	I know how it can look really bad.
802.082	So to me, this is the courageous thing to do,
806.219	to try to reach the other side before it's too late,
809.658	because when it's going to be too late, it's going to be too late.
811.573	And sometimes war is inevitable, sometimes,
815.994	but maybe [with] effort, we can avoid it.
820.064	Maybe as people, because especially in Israel,
823.419	we're in a democracy. We have the freedom of speech,
826.832	and maybe that little thing can change something.
830.275	And really, we can be our own ambassadors.
834.62	We can just send a message and hope for the best.
841.356	So I want to ask Michal, my wife, to come with me
843.698	on the stage just to make with you one image,
848.478	because it's all about images.
850.603	And maybe that image will help us change something.
855.174	Just raise that. Exactly.
858.681	And I'm just going to take a picture of it,
861.182	and I'm just going to post it on Facebook
863.984	"with kind of ""Israelis for peace"" or something."
871.9	Oh my God.
874.41	Don't cry.
876.772	Thank you guys.
878.463	(Applause)
