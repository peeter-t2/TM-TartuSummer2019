12.53	So let's start with some good news,
15.491	and the good news has to do with what do we know
17.84	based on biomedical research
20.107	that actually has changed the outcomes
23.561	for many very serious diseases?
26.66	Let's start with leukemia,
28.907	acute lymphoblastic leukemia, ALL,
31.435	the most common cancer of children.
33.873	When I was a student,
35.835	the mortality rate was about 95 percent.
39.675	Today, some 25, 30 years later, we're talking about
42.808	a mortality rate that's reduced by 85 percent.
46.435	Six thousand children each year
49.051	who would have previously died of this disease are cured.
53.24	If you want the really big numbers,
55.031	look at these numbers for heart disease.
57.859	Heart disease used to be the biggest killer,
59.651	particularly for men in their 40s.
61.155	Today, we've seen a 63-percent reduction in mortality
64.649	from heart disease --
66.71	remarkably, 1.1 million deaths averted every year.
71.595	AIDS, incredibly, has just been named,
74.316	in the past month, a chronic disease,
76.597	meaning that a 20-year-old who becomes infected with HIV
79.512	is expected not to live weeks, months, or a couple of years,
83.583	as we said only a decade ago,
85.853	but is thought to live decades,
88.245	probably to die in his '60s or '70s from other causes altogether.
92.741	These are just remarkable, remarkable changes
95.766	in the outlook for some of the biggest killers.
98.355	And one in particular
100.434	that you probably wouldn't know about, stroke,
102.479	which has been, along with heart disease,
104.08	one of the biggest killers in this country,
106.258	is a disease in which now we know
108.049	that if you can get people into the emergency room
110.978	within three hours of the onset,
113.152	some 30 percent of them will be able to leave the hospital
115.757	without any disability whatsoever.
118.876	Remarkable stories,
121.133	good-news stories,
123.164	all of which boil down to understanding
126.229	something about the diseases that has allowed us
129.581	to detect early and intervene early.
132.904	Early detection, early intervention,
135.039	that's the story for these successes.
138.109	Unfortunately, the news is not all good.
140.845	Let's talk about one other story
143.194	which has to do with suicide.
144.885	Now this is, of course, not a disease, per se.
147.537	It's a condition, or it's a situation
150.625	that leads to mortality.
152.414	What you may not realize is just how prevalent it is.
155.494	There are 38,000 suicides each year in the United States.
159.703	That means one about every 15 minutes.
162.461	Third most common cause of death amongst people
165.237	between the ages of 15 and 25.
168.013	It's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize
170.261	that this is twice as common as homicide
172.773	and actually more common as a source of death
175.422	than traffic fatalities in this country.
178.757	Now, when we talk about suicide,
181.389	there is also a medical contribution here,
184.501	because 90 percent of suicides
186.933	are related to a mental illness:
188.703	depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia,
191.749	anorexia, borderline personality. There's a long list
194.808	of disorders that contribute,
196.917	and as I mentioned before, often early in life.
200.941	But it's not just the mortality from these disorders.
204.145	It's also morbidity.
205.787	If you look at disability,
208.048	as measured by the World Health Organization
210.2	with something they call the Disability Adjusted Life Years,
213.725	it's kind of a metric that nobody would think of
215.821	except an economist,
217.135	except it's one way of trying to capture what is lost
220.577	in terms of disability from medical causes,
223.76	and as you can see, virtually 30 percent
226.653	of all disability from all medical causes
228.917	can be attributed to mental disorders,
231.477	neuropsychiatric syndromes.
233.861	You're probably thinking that doesn't make any sense.
236.013	I mean, cancer seems far more serious.
238.685	Heart disease seems far more serious.
241.717	But you can see actually they are further down this list,
244.757	and that's because we're talking here about disability.
247.037	What drives the disability for these disorders
249.829	like schizophrenia and bipolar and depression?
253.733	Why are they number one here?
256.708	Well, there are probably three reasons.
258.217	One is that they're highly prevalent.
260.189	About one in five people will suffer from one of these disorders
263.484	in the course of their lifetime.
266.061	A second, of course, is that, for some people,
268.381	these become truly disabling,
269.965	and it's about four to five percent, perhaps one in 20.
273.093	But what really drives these numbers, this high morbidity,
277.357	and to some extent the high mortality,
279.786	is the fact that these start very early in life.
283.734	Fifty percent will have onset by age 14,
289.949	a picture that is very different than what one would see
293.414	if you're talking about cancer or heart disease,
295.685	diabetes, hypertension -- most of the major illnesses
299.085	that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality.
303.181	These are, indeed, the chronic disorders of young people.
309.491	Now, I started by telling you that there were some good-news stories.
312.358	This is obviously not one of them.
313.806	This is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult,
316.685	and in a sense this is a kind of confession for me.
319.269	My job is to actually make sure that we make progress
324.621	on all of these disorders.
326.973	I work for the federal government.
328.683	Actually, I work for you. You pay my salary.
330.701	And maybe at this point, when you know what I do,
333.085	or maybe what I've failed to do,
335.205	you'll think that I probably ought to be fired,
337.414	and I could certainly understand that.
339.569	But what I want to suggest, and the reason I'm here
341.901	is to tell you that I think we're about to be
345.156	in a very different world as we think about these illnesses.
349.819	What I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders,
352.925	diseases of the mind.
354.641	That's actually becoming a rather unpopular term these days,
358.037	and people feel that, for whatever reason,
360.237	it's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders
363.614	and to talk about these as disorders of behavior.
367.525	Fair enough. They are disorders of behavior,
369.792	and they are disorders of the mind.
371.792	But what I want to suggest to you
374.197	is that both of those terms,
375.949	which have been in play for a century or more,
378.967	are actually now impediments to progress,
381.787	that what we need conceptually to make progress here
386.117	is to rethink these disorders as brain disorders.
391.325	Now, for some of you, you're going to say,
393.187	"""Oh my goodness, here we go again."
395.406	We're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance
398.034	or we're going to hear about drugs
399.769	or we're going to hear about some very simplistic notion
404.595	that will take our subjective experience
407.535	and turn it into molecules, or maybe into some sort of
413.607	very flat, unidimensional understanding
416.825	of what it is to have depression or schizophrenia.
420.927	When we talk about the brain, it is anything but
425.425	unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic.
428.688	It depends, of course, on what scale
431.647	or what scope you want to think about,
433.943	but this is an organ of surreal complexity,
440.223	and we are just beginning to understand
443.694	how to even study it, whether you're thinking about
445.867	the 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex
448.449	or the 100 trillion synapses
450.594	that make up all the connections.
452.953	We have just begun to try to figure out
456.529	how do we take this very complex machine
460.057	that does extraordinary kinds of information processing
462.801	and use our own minds to understand
465.518	this very complex brain that supports our own minds.
469.049	It's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution
471.609	that we simply don't have a brain
475.439	that seems to be wired well enough to understand itself.
478.337	In a sense, it actually makes you feel that
480.651	when you're in the safe zone of studying behavior or cognition,
483.489	something you can observe,
484.812	that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic
487.817	than trying to engage this very complex, mysterious organ
492.785	that we're beginning to try to understand.
495.213	Now, already in the case of the brain disorders
498.869	that I've been talking to you about,
500.597	depression, obsessive compulsive disorder,
502.87	post-traumatic stress disorder,
505.032	while we don't have an in-depth understanding
507.974	of how they are abnormally processed
511.7	or what the brain is doing in these illnesses,
513.805	we have been able to already identify
516.86	some of the connectional differences, or some of the ways
519.436	in which the circuitry is different
521.94	for people who have these disorders.
523.756	We call this the human connectome,
525.514	and you can think about the connectome
527.895	sort of as the wiring diagram of the brain.
529.767	You'll hear more about this in a few minutes.
531.871	The important piece here is that as you begin to look
534.822	at people who have these disorders, the one in five of us
538.799	who struggle in some way,
540.627	you find that there's a lot of variation
542.915	in the way that the brain is wired,
546.131	but there are some predictable patterns, and those patterns
548.733	are risk factors for developing one of these disorders.
552.547	It's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders
555.539	like Huntington's or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease
558.307	where you have a bombed-out part of your cortex.
560.699	Here we're talking about traffic jams, or sometimes detours,
563.959	or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected
566.706	and the way that the brain functions.
567.953	You could, if you want, compare this to,
571.123	on the one hand, a myocardial infarction, a heart attack,
574.172	where you have dead tissue in the heart,
575.995	versus an arrhythmia, where the organ simply isn't functioning
579.592	because of the communication problems within it.
581.843	Either one would kill you; in only one of them
583.812	will you find a major lesion.
586.412	As we think about this, probably it's better to actually go
589.244	a little deeper into one particular disorder, and that would be schizophrenia,
592.467	because I think that's a good case
594.603	for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters.
598.128	These are scans from Judy Rapoport and her colleagues
602.006	at the National Institute of Mental Health
604.178	in which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia,
607.894	and you can see already in the top
609.364	there's areas that are red or orange, yellow,
611.901	are places where there's less gray matter,
614.039	and as they followed them over five years,
615.577	comparing them to age match controls,
617.815	you can see that, particularly in areas like
619.637	the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
621.953	or the superior temporal gyrus, there's a profound loss of gray matter.
626.283	And it's important, if you try to model this,
627.826	you can think about normal development
629.782	as a loss of cortical mass, loss of cortical gray matter,
633.035	and what's happening in schizophrenia is that you overshoot that mark,
636.699	and at some point, when you overshoot,
638.268	you cross a threshold, and it's that threshold
641.259	where we say, this is a person who has this disease,
644.835	because they have the behavioral symptoms
647.123	of hallucinations and delusions.
649.244	That's something we can observe.
650.721	But look at this closely and you can see that actually they've crossed a different threshold.
656.363	They've crossed a brain threshold much earlier,
659.359	that perhaps not at age 22 or 20,
662.499	but even by age 15 or 16 you can begin to see
665.267	the trajectory for development is quite different
667.627	at the level of the brain, not at the level of behavior.
671.142	Why does this matter? Well first because,
673.237	for brain disorders, behavior is the last thing to change.
676.379	We know that for Alzheimer's, for Parkinson's, for Huntington's.
679.289	There are changes in the brain a decade or more
681.723	before you see the first signs of a behavioral change.
686.763	The tools that we have now allow us to detect
689.707	these brain changes much earlier, long before the symptoms emerge.
694.004	But most important, go back to where we started.
697.403	The good-news stories in medicine
700.619	are early detection, early intervention.
703.563	If we waited until the heart attack,
707.227	we would be sacrificing 1.1 million lives
711.202	every year in this country to heart disease.
713.611	That is precisely what we do today
716.019	when we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders,
720.531	brain circuit disorders, has a behavioral disorder.
723.733	We wait until the behavior becomes manifest.
726.957	That's not early detection. That's not early intervention.
731.516	Now to be clear, we're not quite ready to do this.
733.321	We don't have all the facts. We don't actually even know
736.475	what the tools will be,
739.024	nor what to precisely look for in every case to be able
743.283	to get there before the behavior emerges as different.
747.488	But this tells us how we need to think about it,
750.425	and where we need to go.
751.914	Are we going to be there soon?
753.116	I think that this is something that will happen
755.794	over the course of the next few years, but I'd like to finish
758.625	with a quote about trying to predict how this will happen
761.16	by somebody who's thought a lot about changes
763.521	in concepts and changes in technology.
765.849	"""We always overestimate the change that will occur"
768.113	in the next two years and underestimate
770.336	"the change that will occur in the next 10."" -- Bill Gates."
774.212	Thanks very much.
775.575	(Applause)
