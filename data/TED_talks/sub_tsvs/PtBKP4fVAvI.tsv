12.564	My students and I
12.564	work on very tiny robots.
16.209	Now, you can think of these
16.209	as robotic versions
18.426	of something that you're all
18.426	very familiar with: an ant.
22.016	We all know that ants
22.016	and other insects at this size scale
24.776	can do some pretty incredible things.
27.012	We've all seen a group of ants,
27.012	or some version of that,
30.197	carting off your potato chip
30.197	at a picnic, for example.
34.467	But what are the real challenges
34.467	of engineering these ants?
37.91	Well, first of all, how do we get
37.91	the capabilities of an ant
41.861	in a robot at the same size scale?
43.909	Well, first we need to figure out
43.909	how to make them move
46.513	when they're so small.
47.923	We need mechanisms like legs
47.923	and efficient motors
50.223	in order to support that locomotion,
52.072	and we need the sensors,
52.072	power and control
54.563	in order to pull everything together
54.563	in a semi-intelligent ant robot.
58.525	And finally, to make
58.525	these things really functional,
61.071	we want a lot of them working together
61.071	in order to do bigger things.
65.019	So I'll start with mobility.
67.71	Insects move around amazingly well.
70.871	This video is from UC Berkeley.
72.559	It shows a cockroach moving
72.559	over incredibly rough terrain
75.342	without tipping over,
77.195	and it's able to do this because its legs
77.195	are a combination of rigid materials,
81.192	which is what we traditionally
81.192	use to make robots,
83.545	and soft materials.
86.374	Jumping is another really interesting way
86.374	to get around when you're very small.
90.201	So these insects store energy in a spring
90.201	and release that really quickly
94.27	to get the high power they need
94.27	to jump out of water, for example.
98.281	So one of the big
98.281	contributions from my lab
101.403	has been to combine
101.403	rigid and soft materials
104.153	in very, very small mechanisms.
106.367	So this jumping mechanism
106.367	is about four millimeters on a side,
109.532	so really tiny.
111.22	The hard material here is silicon,
111.22	and the soft material is silicone rubber.
115.058	And the basic idea is that
115.058	we're going to compress this,
117.953	store energy in the springs,
117.953	and then release it to jump.
120.654	So there's no motors
120.654	on board this right now, no power.
124.037	This is actuated with a method
124.037	that we call in my lab
126.8	"""graduate student with tweezers."""
126.8	(Laughter)
129.472	So what you'll see in the next video
131.306	is this guy doing
131.306	amazingly well for its jumps.
134.333	So this is Aaron, the graduate student
134.333	in question, with the tweezers,
137.947	and what you see is this 
137.947	four-millimeter-sized mechanism
140.63	jumping almost 40 centimeters high.
142.841	That's almost 100 times its own length.
145.265	And it survives, bounces on the table,
147.221	it's incredibly robust, and of course
147.221	survives quite well until we lose it
150.735	because it's very tiny.
153.361	Ultimately, though, we want
153.361	to add motors to this too,
155.97	and we have students in the lab
155.97	working on millimeter-sized motors
159.086	to eventually integrate onto
159.086	small, autonomous robots.
162.686	But in order to look at mobility and
162.686	locomotion at this size scale to start,
166.267	we're cheating and using magnets.
168.241	So this shows what would eventually
168.241	be part of a micro-robot leg,
171.317	and you can see the silicone rubber joints
173.334	and there's an embedded magnet
173.334	that's being moved around
175.963	by an external magnetic field.
178.266	So this leads to the robot
178.266	that I showed you earlier.
181.959	The really interesting thing
181.959	that this robot can help us figure out
185.11	is how insects move at this scale.
187.117	We have a really good model
187.117	for how everything
189.342	from a cockroach up to an elephant moves.
191.304	We all move in this 
191.304	kind of bouncy way when we run.
194.228	But when I'm really small, 
194.228	the forces between my feet and the ground
198.513	are going to affect my locomotion
198.513	a lot more than my mass,
201.288	which is what causes that bouncy motion.
203.642	So this guy doesn't work quite yet,
205.317	but we do have slightly larger versions
205.317	that do run around.
208.392	So this is about a centimeter cubed,
208.392	a centimeter on a side, so very tiny,
212.277	and we've gotten this to run
212.277	about 10 body lengths per second,
215.179	so 10 centimeters per second.
216.565	It's pretty quick for a little, small guy,
218.598	and that's really only limited 
218.598	by our test setup.
220.96	But this gives you some idea
220.96	of how it works right now.
224.027	We can also make 3D-printed versions 
224.027	of this that can climb over obstacles,
227.781	a lot like the cockroach
227.781	that you saw earlier.
231.28	But ultimately we want to add
231.28	everything onboard the robot.
234.166	We want sensing, power, control,
234.166	actuation all together,
237.859	and not everything
237.859	needs to be bio-inspired.
240.765	So this robot's about
240.765	the size of a Tic Tac.
243.9	And in this case, instead of magnets
243.9	or muscles to move this around,
247.849	we use rockets.
250.274	So this is a micro-fabricated
250.274	energetic material,
252.94	and we can create tiny pixels of this,
255.539	and we can put one of these pixels
255.539	on the belly of this robot,
259.326	and this robot, then, is going to jump
259.326	when it senses an increase in light.
264.645	So the next video is one of my favorites.
266.618	So you have this 300-milligram robot
269.658	jumping about eight
269.658	centimeters in the air.
272.064	It's only four by four
272.064	by seven millimeters in size.
274.974	And you'll see a big flash
274.974	at the beginning
277.13	when the energetic is set off,
278.622	and the robot tumbling through the air.
280.53	So there was that big flash,
282.139	and you can see the robot
282.139	jumping up through the air.
285.336	So there's no tethers on this,
285.336	no wires connecting to this.
288.368	Everything is onboard,
288.368	and it jumped in response
290.862	to the student just flicking on
290.862	a desk lamp next to it.
295.243	So I think you can imagine
295.243	all the cool things that we could do
298.897	with robots that can run and crawl
298.897	and jump and roll at this size scale.
303.604	Imagine the rubble that you get after 
303.604	a natural disaster like an earthquake.
307.394	Imagine these small robots
307.394	running through that rubble
309.953	to look for survivors.
312.171	Or imagine a lot of small robots
312.171	running around a bridge
315.127	in order to inspect it
315.127	and make sure it's safe
317.286	so you don't get collapses like this,
319.326	which happened outside of 
319.326	Minneapolis in 2007.
323.233	Or just imagine what you could do
324.995	if you had robots that could
324.995	swim through your blood.
327.518	"Right? ""Fantastic Voyage,"" Isaac Asimov."
329.851	Or they could operate without having
329.851	to cut you open in the first place.
334.206	Or we could radically change
334.206	the way we build things
336.936	if we have our tiny robots
336.936	work the same way that termites do,
340.343	and they build these incredible
340.343	eight-meter-high mounds,
343.108	effectively well ventilated
343.108	apartment buildings for other termites
347.196	in Africa and Australia.
349.287	So I think I've given you
349.287	some of the possibilities
351.717	of what we can do with these small robots.
354.154	And we've made some advances so far,
354.154	but there's still a long way to go,
358.561	and hopefully some of you
358.561	can contribute to that destination.
361.419	Thanks very much.
363.187	(Applause)
