25	So I really consider myself a storyteller.
29	But I don't really tell stories in the usual way,
33	in the sense that I don't usually tell my own stories.
37	Instead, I'm really interested in building tools that allow
39	large numbers of other people to tell their stories,
43	people all around the world.
45	I do this because I think that people actually have a lot in common.
49	I think people are very similar,
51	but I also think that we have trouble seeing that.
54	You know, as I look around the world I see a lot of gaps,
57	and I think we all see a lot of gaps.
59	And we define ourselves by our gaps.
62	There's language gaps,
64	there's ethnicity and racial gaps, there's age gaps,
68	there's gender gaps, there's sexuality gaps,
73	there's wealth and money gaps, there's education gaps,
78	there's also religious gaps.
80	You know, we have all these gaps and I think we like our gaps
82	because they make us feel like we identify with something,
85	some smaller community.
86	But I think that actually, despite our gaps,
89	we really have a lot in common.
90	And I think one thing we have in common is a very deep need
95	to express ourselves.
96	I think this is a very old human desire. It's nothing new.
102	But the thing about self-expression
103	is that there's traditionally been this imbalance
105	between the desire that we have to express ourselves
108	and the number of sympathetic friends
110	who are willing to stand around and listen.
112	(Laughter)
114	This, also, is nothing new.
116	Since the dawn of human history, we've tried to rectify this imbalance
119	by making art, writing poems, singing songs,
123	scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper,
126	gossiping with friends. This is nothing new.
128	What's new is that in the last several years
130	a lot of these very traditional physical human activities,
133	these acts of self-expression, have been moving onto the Internet.
136	And as that's happened, people have been leaving behind footprints,
140	footprints that tell stories of their moments of self-expression.
144	And so what I do is, I write computer programs
147	that study very large sets of these footprints,
150	and then try to draw conclusions about the people who left them --
154	what they feel, what they think,
156	what's different in the world today than usual,
159	these sorts of questions.
161	One project that explores these ideas,
163	which was made about a year ago,
164	is a piece called We Feel Fine.
165	This is a piece that every two or three minutes
168	scans the world's newly-posted blog entries
170	"for occurrences of the phrases ""I feel"" or ""I am feeling."""
175	And when it finds one of those phrases,
176	it grabs the sentence up to the period,
178	and then automatically tries to deduce the age, gender
181	and geographical location of the person that wrote that sentence.
185	Then, knowing the geographical location and the time,
187	we can also then figure out the weather
188	when that person wrote the sentence.
191	All of this information is saved in a database
193	that collects about 20,000 feelings a day.
195	It's been running for about a year and a half.
197	It's reached about seven-and-a-half million human feelings now.
200	And I'll show you a glimpse
201	of how this information is then visualized. So this is We Feel Fine.
207	What you see here is a madly swarming mass of particles,
211	each of which represents a single human feeling
213	that was stated in the last few hours.
216	The color of each particle corresponds to the type of feeling inside --
219	so that happy, positive feelings are brightly colored.
222	And sad, negative feelings are darkly colored.
224	The diameter of each dot
226	represents the length of the sentence inside,
228	so that the large dots contain large sentences,
230	and the small dots contain small sentences.
232	Any dot can be clicked and expanded. And we see here,
236	"""I would just feel so much better"
237	if I could curl up in his arms right now and feel his affection for me
240	"in the embrace of his body and the tenderness of his lips."""
243	So it gets pretty hot and steamy sometimes
245	in the world of human emotions.
247	And all of these are stated by people:
250	"""I know that objectively it really doesn't mean much,"
252	but after spending so many years as a small fish in a big pond,
255	"it's nice to feel bigger again."""
257	The dots exhibit human qualities. They kind of have their own physics,
260	and they swarm wildly around, kind of exploring the world of life.
265	And then they also exhibit curiosity.
266	You can see a few of them are swarming around the cursor right now.
269	You can see some other ones
271	are swarming around the bottom left corner of the screen
273	around six words. Those six words represent the six movements
276	of We Feel Fine. We're currently seeing Madness.
279	There's also Murmurs, Montage, Mobs, Metrics and Mounds.
283	And I'll walk you through a few of those now.
285	Murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling.
289	And then, one by one, in reverse chronological order,
291	they excuse themselves, entering the scrolling list of feelings.
296	"""I feel a bit better now."""
297	(Laughter)
300	"""I feel confused and unsure of what the hell I want to do."""
303	"""I feel gypped out of something awesome here."""
306	"""I feel so free; I feel so good."""
308	"""I feel like I'm in this fog of depression that I can't get out of."""
311	And you can click any of these to go out and visit the blog
313	from which it was collected. And in that way,
315	you can connect with the authors of these statements
318	if you feel some degree of empathy.
320	The next movement is called Montage.
322	Montage causes all of the feelings that contain photographs
325	to become extracted and display themselves in a grid.
329	This grid is then said to represent the picture of the world's feelings
333	in the last few hours, if you will.
334	Each of these can be clicked and we can blow it up.
337	"We see, ""I just feel like I'm not going to have fun"
340	"if it's not the both of us."" That was from someone in Michigan."
346	"We see, ""I feel like I have been at a computer all day."""
350	(Laughter)
353	These are automatically constructed using the found objects:
356	"""I think I feel a little full."""
360	The next movement is called mobs.
361	Mobs provides different statistical breakdowns
363	of the population of the world's feelings in the last few hours.
366	"We see that ""better"" is the most frequent feeling right now,"
368	"followed by ""good,"" ""bad,"" ""guilty,"" ""right,"" ""down,"" ""sick"" and so on."
373	We can also get a gender breakdown.
374	And we see that women are slightly more prolific
376	talking about their emotions in the last few hours than men.
380	We can do an age breakdown, which gives us a histogram
382	of the world's emotional distribution by age.
385	We see people in their twenties are the most prolific,
388	followed by teenagers, and then people in their thirties,
390	and it dies out very quickly from there.
392	In weather, the feelings assume the physical characteristics
396	of the weather that they represent,
397	so that the ones collected on a sunny day
399	swirl around as if they're part of the sun.
401	The cloudy ones float along as if they're on a breeze.
404	The rainy ones fall down as if they're in a rainstorm,
406	and the snowy ones kind of flutter to the ground.
409	Finally, location causes the feelings to move to their positions
412	on a world map showing the geographical distribution of feelings.
417	Metrics provides more numerical views on the data.
419	"We see that the world is feeling ""used"""
420	at 3.3 times the normal level right now.
423	(Laughter)
426	"They're feeling ""warm"" at 2.9 times the normal level, and so on."
430	Other views are also available.
431	Here are gender, age, weather, location.
433	The final movement is called Mounds.
435	It's a bit different from the others.
436	Mounds visualizes the entire dataset as large, gelatinous blobs
440	which kind of jiggle.
442	And if I hold down my cursor, they do a little dance.
445	"We see ""better"" is the most frequent feeling, followed by ""bad."""
448	And then if I go over here, the list begins to scroll,
451	and there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected.
453	You can see the little pink cursor moving along,
455	representing our position.
457	"Here we see people that feel ""slipping,"" ""nauseous,"" ""responsible."""
461	There's also a search capability,
462	if you're interested in finding out about a certain population.
465	"For instance, you could find women who feel ""addicted"""
467	in their 20s when it was cloudy in Bangladesh.
471	(Laughter)
475	But I'll spare you that.
476	So here are some of my favorite montages that have been collected:
480	"""I feel so much of my dad alive in me that there isn't even room for me."""
485	"""I feel very lonely."""
489	"""I need to be in some backwoods redneck town"
491	"so that I can feel beautiful."""
496	"""I feel invisible to you."""
499	"""I wouldn't hide it if society didn't make me feel like I needed to."""
505	"""I feel in love with Carolyn."" ""I feel so naughty."""
512	"""I feel these weirdoes are actually an asset to college life."""
515	(Laughter)
519	"""I love how I feel today."""
522	So as you can see, We Feel Fine uses a technique
524	"that I call ""passive observation."""
525	What I mean by that is that it passively observes people
528	as they live their lives. It scans the world's blogs
532	and looks at what people are writing,
533	and these people don't know they're being watched or interviewed.
536	And because of that,
537	you end up getting very honest, candid, sincere responses
540	that are often very moving.
542	And this is a technique that I usually prefer in my work
544	because people don't know they're being interviewed.
546	They're just living life, and they end up just acting like that.
550	Another technique is directly questioning people.
552	And this is a technique that I explored in a different project,
554	the Yahoo! Time Capsule,
555	which was designed to take a fingerprint of the world in 2006.
560	It was divided into ten very simple themes --
562	love, anger, sadness and so on --
564	each of which contained a single, very open-ended question
566	put to the world: What do you love? What makes you angry?
569	What makes you sad? What do you believe in? And so on.
571	The time capsule was available for one month online,
573	translated into 10 languages, and this is what it looked like.
578	It's a spinning globe,
579	the surface of which is entirely composed of the pictures
582	and words and drawings of people
584	that submitted to the time capsule.
586	The ten themes radiate out and orbit the time capsule.
588	You can sift through this data and see what people have submitted.
592	"This is in response to, What's beautiful? ""Miss World."""
594	There are two modes to the time capsule.
596	There's One World, which presents the spinning globe,
598	and Many Voices, which splits the data out into film strips
602	and lets you sift through them one by one.
605	So this project was punctuated by a really amazing event,
609	which was held in the desert outside Albuquerque in New Mexico
614	at the Jemez Pueblo, where for three consecutive nights,
616	the contents of the capsule were projected onto the sides
619	of the ancient Red Rock Canyon walls,
621	which stand about 200 feet tall. It was really incredible.
623	And we also projected the contents of the time capsule
626	as binary code using a 35-watt laser into outer space.
629	You can see the orange line leaving the desert floor
632	at about a 45 degree angle there. This was amazing
634	because the first night I looked at all this information
638	and really started seeing the gaps that I talked about earlier --
641	the differences in age, gender and wealth and so on.
644	But, you know, as I looked at this more and more and more,
646	and saw these images go across the rocks,
648	I realized I was seeing the same archetypal events
650	depicted again and again and again.
652	You know: weddings, births, funerals, the first car, the first kiss,
657	the first camel or horse -- depending on the culture.
660	And it was really moving. And this picture here was taken
664	the final night from a distant cliff about two miles away,
667	where the contents of the capsule were being beamed into space.
670	And there was something very moving
672	about all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky.
675	And it started to make me think a lot about the night sky,
678	and how humans have always used the night sky
679	to project their great stories.
681	You know, as a child in Vermont, on a farm where I grew up,
684	I would often look up into the dark sky
686	and see the three star belt of Orion, the Hunter.
689	And as an adult, I've been more aware
691	of the great Greek myths playing out in the sky overhead every night.
695	You know, Orion facing the roaring bull.
697	Perseus flying to the rescue of Andromeda.
699	Zeus battling Chronos for control of Mount Olympus.
702	I mean, these are the great tales of the Greeks.
704	And it caused me to wonder about our world today.
707	And it caused me to wonder specifically,
709	if we could make new constellations today,
712	what would those look like? What would those be?
714	If we could make new pictures in the sky, what would we draw?
717	What are the great stories of today?
718	And those are the questions that inspired my new project,
722	which is debuting here today at TED.
724	Nobody's seen this yet, publicly.
726	It's called Universe: Revealing Our Modern Mythology.
730	And it uses this metaphor of an interactive night sky.
733	So, it's my great pleasure now to show this to you.
736	So, Universe will open here.
737	And you'll see that it leads with a shifting star field,
742	and there's an Aurora Borealis in the background,
744	kind of morphing with color. The color of the Aurora Borealis
747	can be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom,
751	and we'll put it down here to red.
753	So you see this kind of -- these stars moving along.
756	Now, these aren't just little points of light, little pixels.
759	Each of those stars actually represents
761	a specific event in the real world --
764	a quote that was stated by somebody, an image,
767	a news story, a person, a company. You know,
770	some kind of heroic personality.
773	And you might notice that as the cursor begins
775	to touch some of these stars, that shapes begin to emerge.
779	We see here there's a little man walking along, or maybe a woman.
782	And we see here a photograph with a head.
787	You can start to see words emerging here.
790	And those are
792	the constellations of today.
794	And I can turn them all on,
795	and you can see them moving across the sky now.
798	This is the universe of 2007, the last two months.
801	The data from this is global news coverage
803	from thousands of news sources around the world.
805	It's using the API of a really great company that I work with
809	in New York, actually, called Daylife.
811	And it's kind of the zeitgeist view at this level
814	of the world's current mythology over the last couple of months.
818	So we can see where it's emerging here, like President Ford,
822	Iraq, Bush. And we can actually isolate just the words --
825	I call them secrets -- and we can cause them to form
827	an alphabetical list. And we see Anna Nicole Smith
831	playing a big role recently.
833	President Ford -- this is Gerald Ford's funeral.
836	We can actually click anything in Universe
839	and have it become the center of the universe,
840	and everything else will enter its orbit.
842	So, we'll click Ford, and now that becomes the center.
845	And the things that relate to Ford enter its orbit
848	and swirl around it.
850	We can isolate just the photographs, and we now see those.
853	We can click on one of those
854	and have the photograph be the center of the universe.
857	Now the things that relate to it are swirling around.
860	We can click on this and we see this iconic image
863	of Betty Ford kissing her husband's coffin.
866	In Universe, there's kind of no end. It just goes infinitely,
872	and you can just kind of click on stuff.
874	This is a photographic representation, called Snapshots.
878	But we can actually be more specific in defining our universe.
882	So, if we want to,
883	let's check out what Bill Clinton's universe looks like.
886	And let's see, in the past week, what he's been up to.
890	So now, we have a new universe, which is just constrained
893	to all things Bill Clinton.
895	We can have his constellations emerge here.
898	We can pull out his secrets,
899	and we see that it has a lot to do with candidates,
902	Hillary, presidential, Barack Obama.
906	We can see the stories
907	that Bill Clinton is taking part in right now.
910	Any of those can be opened up.
912	So we see Obama and the Clintons meet in Alabama.
915	You can see that this is an important story;
916	there are a lot of things in its orbit. If we open this up,
920	we get different perspectives on this story.
923	You can click any of those to go out and read the article
925	at the source. This one's from Al Jazeera.
928	We can also see the superstars. These would be the people
932	that are kind of the looming heroes and heroines
935	in the universe of Bill Clinton. So there's Bill Clinton, Hillary,
938	Iraq, George Bush, Barack Obama, Scooter Libby --
942	these are kind of the people of Bill Clinton.
945	We can also see a world map, so this shows us the geographic reach
949	of Bill Clinton in the last week or so.
950	We can see he's been focused in America
952	because he's been campaigning, probably,
954	but a little bit of action over here in the Middle East.
956	And then we can also see a timeline.
958	So we see that he was a bit quiet on Saturday,
961	but he was back to work on Sunday morning,
963	and actually been tapering off since then this week.
966	And it's not limited to just people or dates,
968	but we can actually put in concepts also.
970	So if I put in climate change for all of 2006,
974	we'll see what that universe looks like.
976	Here we have our star field. Here we have our shapes.
979	Here we have our secrets.
982	So we see again, climate change is large:
984	Nairobi, global conference, environmental.
987	And there are also quotes that you can see,
989	if you're interested in reading about quotes on climate change.
991	You know, this is really an infinite thing.
993	The superstars of climate change in 2006:
995	United States, Britain, China. You know,
998	these are the towering countries that kind of define this concept.
1001	So this is a piece that demands exploration.
1004	This will be online in several days, probably next Tuesday.
1009	And you'll all be able to use it and kind of explore
1013	what your own personal mythology might be.
1015	You'll notice that in Daylife -- rather, in Universe --
1018	it supports both the notion of a global mythology,
1020	which is represented by something as broad as, say, 2007,
1023	and also a personal mythology.
1025	As you search for the things that are important to you in your world,
1029	and then see what the constellations of those might look like.
1033	So it's been a pleasure. Thank you very much.
1036	(Applause)
