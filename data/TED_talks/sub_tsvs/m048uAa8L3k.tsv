12.697	When I was invited to give this talk 
12.697	a couple of months ago,
17.383	we discussed a number 
17.383	of titles with the organizers,
20.893	and a lot of different items were 
20.893	kicked around and were discussed.
24.308	But nobody suggested this one,
26.349	and the reason for that
26.349	was two months ago,
29.278	Ebola was escalating exponentially
32.19	and spreading over wider geographic areas
32.19	than we had ever seen,
36.553	and the world was terrified, 
36.553	concerned and alarmed
39.822	by this disease, in a way we've not 
39.822	seen in recent history.
44.79	But today, I can stand here 
44.79	and I can talk to you about beating Ebola
50.96	because of people 
50.96	whom you've never heard of,
54.656	people like Peter Clement, a Liberian 
54.656	doctor who's working in Lofa County,
61.815	a place that many of you have 
61.815	never heard of, probably, in Liberia.
67.294	The reason that Lofa County 
67.294	is so important
69.684	is because about five months ago,
72.115	when the epidemic was 
72.115	just starting to escalate,
76.533	Lofa County was right at the center, 
76.533	the epicenter of this epidemic.
81.477	At that time, MSF
81.477	and the treatment center there,
85.222	they were seeing dozens of patients 
85.222	every single day,
88.097	and these patients, these communities
88.097	were becoming more and more terrified
92.345	as time went by, with this disease 
92.345	and what it was doing to their families,
96.713	to their communities, 
96.713	to their children, to their relatives.
100.329	And so Peter Clement was charged with 
100.329	driving that 12-hour-long rough road
105.092	from Monrovia, the capital,
105.092	up to Lofa County,
109.339	to try and help bring control
109.339	to the escalating epidemic there.
113.701	And what Peter found when he arrived was
113.701	the terror that I just mentioned to you.
119.063	So he sat down with the local chiefs, 
119.063	and he listened.
123.304	And what he heard was heartbreaking.
126.945	He heard about the devastation 
126.945	and the desperation
131.279	of people affected by this disease.
134.578	He heard the heartbreaking stories
136.656	about not just the damage
136.656	that Ebola did to people,
140.103	but what it did to families 
140.103	and what it did to communities.
144.589	And he listened to the local chiefs there
144.589	and what they told him --
148.999	"They said, ""When our children are sick, "
148.999	when our children are dying,
152.443	we can't hold them at a time when 
152.443	we want to be closest to them.
156.247	When our relatives die, we can't take care
156.247	of them as our tradition demands.
160.937	We are not allowed to wash 
160.937	the bodies to bury them
163.617	the way our communities and 
163.617	our rituals demand.
166.801	And for this reason, they were
166.801	deeply disturbed, deeply alarmed
170.208	and the entire epidemic 
170.208	was unraveling in front of them.
173.995	People were turning on the healthcare 
173.995	workers who had come,
176.911	the heroes who had come to try 
176.911	and help save the community,
180.265	to help work with the community,
180.265	and they were unable to access them.
185.184	And what happened then was 
185.184	Peter explained to the leaders.
190.402	The leaders listened. 
190.402	They turned the tables.
193.137	And Peter explained what Ebola was.
193.137	He explained what the disease was.
196.744	He explained what it did
196.744	to their communities.
199.019	And he explained that Ebola threatened 
199.019	everything that made us human.
204.177	Ebola means you can't hold your children
204.177	the way you would in this situation.
208.563	You can't bury your dead 
208.563	the way that you would.
210.873	You have to trust these people 
210.873	in these space suits to do that for you.
215.516	And ladies and gentlemen, what 
215.516	happened then was rather extraordinary:
218.865	The community and the health workers, 
218.865	Peter, they sat down together
222.111	and they put together a new plan 
222.111	for controlling Ebola in Lofa County.
227.168	And the reason that this is such 
227.168	an important story, ladies and gentlemen,
231.642	is because today, this county, which is 
231.642	right at the center of this epidemic
236.736	you've been watching, 
236.736	you've been seeing in the newspapers,
239.563	you've been seeing on 
239.563	the television screens,
243.306	today Lofa County is nearly eight weeks
243.306	without seeing a single case of Ebola.
249.393	(Applause)
256.449	Now, this doesn't mean that 
256.449	the job is done, obviously.
259.872	There's still a huge risk
259.872	that there will be additional cases there.
263.128	But what it does teach us 
263.128	is that Ebola can be beaten.
266.392	That's the key thing.
268.049	Even on this scale,
269.216	even with the rapid kind of growth
269.216	that we saw in this environment here,
273.113	we now know Ebola can be beaten.
276.571	When communities come together 
276.571	with health care workers, work together,
280.562	that's when this disease can be stopped.
283.235	But how did Ebola end up
283.235	in Lofa County in the first place?
286.885	Well, for that, we have to go back 
291.577	And as many of you know, 
291.577	this virus went undetected,
294.828	it evaded detection for three 
294.828	or four months when it began.
298.803	That's because this is not 
298.803	a disease of West Africa,
301.466	it's a disease of Central Africa, 
301.466	half a continent away.
304.611	People hadn't seen the disease before;
306.547	health workers hadn't seen 
306.547	the disease before.
309.156	They didn't know what 
309.156	they were dealing with,
311.324	and to make it 
311.324	even more complicated,
313.383	the virus itself was causing a symptom,
313.383	a type of a presentation
317.951	that wasn't classical of the disease.
320.216	So people didn't even recognize 
320.216	the disease, people who knew Ebola.
324.631	For that reason it evaded detection 
324.631	for some time,
328.49	But contrary to public belief 
328.49	sometimes these days,
331.66	once the virus was detected, 
331.66	there was a rapid surge in of support.
337.175	MSF rapidly set up an Ebola treatment 
337.175	center, as many of you know, in the area.
342.236	The World Health Organization
342.236	and the partners that it works with
345.33	deployed eventually hundreds of people 
345.33	over the next two months
349.005	to be able to help track the virus.
351.393	The problem, ladies and gentlemen,
351.393	is by then, this virus,
355.424	well known now as Ebola, 
355.424	had spread too far.
358.977	It had already outstripped what was 
358.977	one of the largest responses
362.186	that had been mounted so far
362.186	to an Ebola outbreak.
365.995	By the middle of the year,
365.995	not just Guinea
368.403	but now Sierra Leone and Liberia
368.403	were also infected.
372.366	As the virus was spreading geographically,
372.366	the numbers were increasing
377.233	and at this time, not only were 
377.233	hundreds of people infected
382.289	and dying of the disease,
384.168	but as importantly,
384.168	the front line responders,
386.907	the people who had gone to try and help,
389.75	the health care workers, the other 
389.75	responders
392.892	were also sick and dying by the dozens.
395.934	The presidents of these countries 
395.934	recognized the emergencies.
398.882	They met right around that time, 
398.882	they agreed on common action
402.422	and they put together an emergency 
402.422	joint operation center in Conakry
406.64	to try and work together to finish this
406.64	disease and get it stopped,
410.96	to implement the strategies
410.96	we talked about.
414.242	But what happened then was something 
414.242	we had never seen before with Ebola.
418.199	What happened then was the virus, 
418.199	or someone sick with the virus,
421.785	boarded an airplane, 
421.785	flew to another country,
425.181	and for the first time,
425.181	we saw in another distant country
429.323	the virus pop up again.
431.879	This time it was in Nigeria,
431.879	in the teeming metropolis of Lagos,
438.245	Now the virus was in that environment.
441.228	And as you can anticipate, 
441.228	there was international alarm,
444.768	international concern on a scale that 
444.768	we hadn't seen in recent years
448.536	caused by a disease like this.
450.99	The World Health Organization immediately 
450.99	called together an expert panel,
455.63	looked at the situation, 
455.63	declared an international emergency.
459.256	And in doing so, the expectation would be
459.256	that there would be a huge outpouring
464.346	of international assistance
464.346	to help these countries
467.316	which were in so much trouble
467.316	and concern at that time.
471.364	But what we saw was 
471.364	something very different.
474.341	There was some great response.
477.869	A number of countries came to assist --
477.869	many, many NGOs and others, as you know,
482.63	but at the same time, the opposite 
482.63	happened in many places.
486.046	Alarm escalated, and very soon 
486.046	these countries found themselves
490.161	not receiving the support they needed,
490.161	but increasingly isolated.
494.556	What we saw was commercial airlines
494.556	[stopped] flying into these countries
499.29	and people who hadn't even been
499.29	exposed to the virus
501.881	were no longer allowed to travel.
504.043	This caused not only problems, obviously, 
504.043	for the countries themselves,
507.971	but also for the response.
510.093	Those organizations that were 
510.093	trying to bring people in,
513.055	to try and help them
513.055	respond to the outbreak,
515.261	they could not get 
515.261	people on airplanes,
517.193	they could not get them into the 
517.193	countries to be able to respond.
520.392	In that situation,
520.392	ladies and gentleman,
522.404	a virus like Ebola takes advantage.
525.639	And what we saw then was something 
525.639	also we hadn't seen before.
530.577	Not only did this virus 
530.577	continue in the places
533.733	where they'd already become infected,
533.733	but then it started to escalate
537.324	and we saw the case numbers
537.324	that you see here,
539.692	something we'd never seen before
539.692	on such a scale,
542.746	an exponential increase of Ebola cases
545.783	not just in these countries or the areas 
545.783	already infected in these countries
550.024	but also spreading further and 
550.024	deeper into these countries.
553.883	Ladies and gentleman,
553.883	this was one of the most concerning
556.947	international emergencies in public health
556.947	we've ever seen.
562.502	And what happened in these countries then,
564.553	many of you saw, again, on the television,
564.553	read about in the newspapers,
568.742	we saw the health system start to collapse
568.742	under the weight of this epidemic.
574.102	We saw the schools begin to close, 
574.102	markets no longer started,
578.722	no longer functioned the way 
578.722	that they should in these countries.
582.042	We saw that misinformation and 
582.042	misperceptions started to spread
586.161	even faster through the communities,
586.161	which became even more alarmed
589.645	about the situation.
591.26	They started to recoil from those people 
591.26	that you saw in those space suits,
594.844	as they call them, 
594.844	who had come to help them.
597.091	And then the situation
597.091	deteriorated even further.
600.118	The countries had to declare
600.118	a state of emergency.
602.8	Large populations needed to be quarantined
602.8	in some areas, and then riots broke out.
608.205	It was a very, very terrifying situation.
611.975	Around the world,
611.975	many people began to ask,
614.834	can we ever stop Ebola 
614.834	when it starts to spread like this?
618.803	And they started to ask, how well 
618.803	do we really know this virus?
623.585	The reality is we don't know 
623.585	Ebola extremely well.
626.74	It's a relatively modern disease
626.74	in terms of what we know about it.
630.735	We've known the disease only for 40 years,
633.02	since it first popped up
633.02	in Central Africa in 1976.
636.502	But despite that, we do know many things:
639.582	We know that this virus
639.582	probably survives in a type of a bat.
643.805	We know that it probably enters 
643.805	a human population
646.921	when we come in contact with a wild animal
649.528	that has been infected with the virus 
649.528	and probably sickened by it.
653.086	Then we know that the virus
653.086	spreads from person to person
656.307	through contaminated body fluids.
658.58	And as you've all seen,
660.071	we know the horrific disease
660.071	that it then causes in humans,
663.553	where we see this disease cause
663.553	severe fevers, diarrhea, vomiting,
668.071	and then unfortunately, in 70 percent
668.071	of the cases or often more, death.
674.541	This is a very dangerous,
674.541	debilitating, and deadly disease.
680.344	But despite the fact that we've not known
680.344	this disease for a particularly long time,
684.517	and we don't know everything about it,
684.517	we do know how to stop this disease.
689.394	There are four things
689.394	that are critical to stopping Ebola.
692.608	First and foremost, the communities 
692.608	have got to understand this disease,
696.922	they've got to understand 
696.922	how it spreads and how to stop it.
700.443	And then we've got to be able to have 
700.443	systems that can find every single case,
704.519	every contact of those cases,
706.525	and begin to track the transmission chains
706.525	so that you can stop transmission.
710.682	We have to have treatment centers,
710.682	specialized Ebola treatment centers,
714.304	where the workers can be protected
716.817	as they try to provide support
716.817	to the people who are infected,
721.689	so that they might survive the disease.
724.134	And then for those who do die,
726.334	we have to ensure there is a safe, but at
726.334	the same time dignified, burial process,
732.192	so that there is no spread 
732.192	at that time as well.
736.798	So we do know how to stop Ebola, and these
736.798	strategies work, ladies and gentlemen.
741.299	The virus was stopped in Nigeria 
741.299	by these four strategies
745.458	and the people implementing 
745.458	them, obviously.
747.562	It was stopped in Senegal, where it had
747.562	spread, and also in the other countries
751.584	that were affected by this virus, 
751.584	in this outbreak.
755.177	So there's no question that 
755.177	these strategies actually work.
759.018	The big question, ladies and gentlemen,
759.018	was whether these strategies could work
764.326	on this scale, in this situation,
764.326	with so many countries affected
768.6	with the kind of exponential 
768.6	growth that you saw.
772.206	That was the big question that we were 
772.206	facing just two or three months ago.
776.757	Today we know the answer to that question.
780.801	And we know that answer 
780.801	because of the extraordinary work
783.779	of an incredible group of NGOs,
783.779	of governments, of local leaders,
788.546	of U.N. agencies and many humanitarian 
788.546	and other organizations
792.932	that came and joined the fight
792.932	to try and stop Ebola in West Africa.
796.85	But what had to be done there 
796.85	was slightly different.
800.293	These countries took those strategies 
800.293	I just showed you;
803.218	the community engagement,
803.218	the case finding, contact tracing, etc.,
808.624	and they turned them on their head.
810.548	There was so much disease,
810.548	they approached it differently.
813.481	What they decided to do was they would 
813.481	first try and slow down this epidemic
818.912	by rapidly building as many beds as
818.912	possible in specialized treatment centers
823.899	so that they could prevent the disease
823.899	from spreading from those were infected.
829.203	They would rapidly build out
829.203	many, many burial teams
831.652	so that they could safely
831.652	deal with the dead,
833.827	and with that, they would try 
833.827	and slow this outbreak
836.394	to see if it could actually then 
836.394	be controlled using the classic approach
840.613	of case finding and contact tracing.
843.364	And when I went to West Africa
843.364	about three months ago,
846.657	when I was there
846.657	what I saw was extraordinary.
849.669	I saw presidents opening emergency
849.669	operation centers themselves against Ebola
854.595	so that they could personally coordinate 
854.595	and oversee and champion
858.363	this surge of international support 
858.363	to try and stop this disease.
862.45	We saw militaries from within 
862.45	those countries and from far beyond
866.001	coming in to help build 
866.001	Ebola treatment centers
868.741	that could be used to isolate 
868.741	those who were sick.
871.991	We saw the Red Cross movement working with
871.991	its partner agencies on the ground there
876.417	to help train the communities so that
876.417	they could actually safely bury their dead
881.574	in a dignified manner themselves.
884.132	And we saw the U.N. agencies, 
884.132	the World Food Program,
886.933	build a tremendous air bridge
888.834	that could get responders to every single
888.834	corner of these countries rapidly
892.736	to be able to implement the strategies
892.736	that we just talked about.
896.089	What we saw, ladies and gentlemen, 
896.089	which was probably most impressive,
899.434	was this incredible work
899.434	by the governments,
902.451	by the leaders in these countries,
902.451	with the communities,
905.468	to try to ensure people 
905.468	understood this disease,
908.486	understood the extraordinary things they 
908.486	would have to do to try and stop Ebola.
914.169	And as a result, ladies and gentlemen,
916.462	we saw something that we did not know
916.462	only two or three months earlier,
920.905	whether or not it would be possible.
923.179	What we saw was 
923.179	what you see now in this graph,
926.309	when we took stock on December 1.
929.118	What we saw was we could 
929.118	bend that curve, so to speak,
932.56	change this exponential growth,
934.934	and bring some hope back
934.934	to the ability to control this outbreak.
939.163	And for this reason, ladies and gentlemen,
939.163	there's absolutely no question now
943.217	that we can catch up with this outbreak 
943.217	in West Africa and we can beat Ebola.
949.785	The big question, though, 
949.785	that many people are asking,
952.958	even when they saw this curve, they said,
954.941	"""Well, hang on a minute --"
954.941	that's great you can slow it down,
957.845	but can you actually
957.845	"drive it down to zero?"""
959.896	We already answered that question 
959.896	back at the beginning of this talk,
963.437	when I spoke about Lofa County in Liberia.
967.59	We told you the story
967.59	how Lofa County got to a situation
971.016	where they have not seen
971.016	Ebola for eight weeks.
973.829	But there are similar stories from 
973.829	the other countries as well.
977.205	From Gueckedou in Guinea,
979.451	the first area where the first case was
979.451	actually diagnosed.
983.959	We've seen very, very few cases
983.959	in the last couple of months,
987.373	and here in Kenema, in Sierra Leone, 
987.373	another area in the epicenter,
991.8	we have not seen the virus
991.8	for more than a couple of weeks --
995.061	way too early to declare 
995.061	victory, obviously,
998.156	but evidence, ladies and gentlemen,
999.931	not only can the response 
999.931	catch up to the disease,
1003.556	but this disease can be driven to zero.
1006.722	The challenge now, of course, 
1006.722	is doing this on the scale needed
1010.878	right across these three countries,
1010.878	and that is a huge challenge.
1016.244	Because when you've been at something
1016.244	for this long, on this scale,
1020.949	two other big threats 
1020.949	come in to join the virus.
1024.949	The first of those is complacency,
1028.052	the risk that as this 
1028.052	disease curve starts to bend,
1031.475	the media look elsewhere, 
1031.475	the world looks elsewhere.
1034.739	Complacency always a risk.
1036.371	And the other risk, of course, is when
1036.371	you've been working so hard for so long,
1040.714	and slept so few hours 
1040.714	over the past months,
1044.352	people are tired, people become fatigued,
1046.59	and these new risks 
1046.59	start to creep into the response.
1050.66	Ladies and gentlemen, I can tell you today
1050.66	I've just come back from West Africa.
1054.94	The people of these countries,
1054.94	the leaders of these countries,
1058.64	they are not complacent.
1060.136	They want to drive Ebola to zero 
1060.136	in their countries.
1063.879	And these people, yes, they're tired, 
1063.879	but they are not fatigued.
1067.664	They have an energy, they have a courage,
1069.869	they have the strength 
1069.869	to get this finished.
1072.399	What they need, ladies
1072.399	and gentlemen, at this point,
1075.153	is the unwavering support of the 
1075.153	international community,
1078.781	to stand with them,
1080.189	to bolster and bring even more support 
1080.189	at this time, to get the job finished.
1085.047	Because finishing Ebola right now 
1085.047	means turning the tables on this virus,
1090.082	and beginning to hunt it.
1091.817	Remember, this virus, this whole crisis, 
1091.817	rather, started with one case,
1097.004	and is going to finish with one case.
1099.703	But it will only finish if those countries
1099.703	have got enough epidemiologists,
1104.027	enough health workers, enough logisticians
1104.027	and enough other people working with them
1108.644	to be able to find every one 
1108.644	of those cases, track their contacts
1112.126	and make sure that this disease 
1112.126	stops once and for all.
1116.22	Ladies and gentleman, Ebola can be beaten.
1119.557	Now we need you to take this story out
1119.557	to tell it to the people who will listen
1124.245	and educate them 
1124.245	on what it means to beat Ebola,
1127.457	and more importantly,
1127.457	we need you to advocate with the people
1131.189	who can help us bring the resources we
1131.189	need to these countries,
1134.743	to beat this disease.
1136.517	There are a lot of people out there 
1136.517	who will survive and will thrive,
1140.699	in part because of what you do 
1140.699	to help us beat Ebola.
1144.101	Thank you.
1145.587	(Applause)
