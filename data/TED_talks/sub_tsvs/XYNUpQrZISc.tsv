12.515	The universe is teeming with planets.
16.118	I want us, in the next decade,
17.994	to build a space telescope that'll be able to image
20.387	an Earth about another star
22.488	and figure out whether it can harbor life.
25.232	My colleagues at the NASA
25.232	Jet Propulsion Laboratory
27.392	at Princeton and I are working on technology
30.253	that will be able to do just that in the coming years.
33.791	Astronomers now believe that every star
35.776	in the galaxy has a planet,
37.716	and they speculate that up to one fifth of them
39.992	have an Earth-like planet
41.068	that might be able to harbor life,
42.76	but we haven't seen any of them.
44.522	We've only detected them indirectly.
47.26	This is NASA's famous picture of the pale blue dot.
50.493	It was taken by the Voyager spacecraft in 1990,
53.29	when they turned it around as
53.29	it was exiting the solar system
56.048	to take a picture of the Earth
57.76	from six billion kilometers away.
60.082	I want to take that
61.65	of an Earth-like planet about another star.
64.232	Why haven't we done that? Why is that hard?
66.632	Well to see, let's imagine we take
68.054	the Hubble Space Telescope
70	and we turn it around and we move it out
71.698	to the orbit of Mars.
73.232	We'll see something like that,
74.44	a slightly blurry picture of the Earth,
76.508	because we're a fairly small telescope
78.829	out at the orbit of Mars.
80.368	Now let's move ten times further away.
82.384	Here we are at the orbit of Uranus.
84.32	It's gotten smaller, it's got less detail, less resolve.
86.806	We can still see the little moon,
88.591	but let's go ten times further away again.
90.704	Here we are at the edge of the solar system,
92.435	out at the Kuiper Belt.
93.733	Now it's not resolved at all.
95.439	It's that pale blue dot of Carl Sagan's.
98.103	But let's move yet again ten times further away.
100.303	Here we are out at the Oort Cloud,
101.927	outside the solar system,
103.487	and we're starting to see the sun
105.103	move into the field of view
106.415	and get into where the planet is.
107.879	One more time, ten times further away.
110.01	Now we're at Alpha Centauri,
111.663	our nearest neighbor star,
112.903	and the planet is gone.
114.252	All we're seeing is the big beaming image of the star
116.86	that's ten billion times brighter than the planet,
119.817	which should be in that little red circle.
121.623	That's what we want to see. That's why it's hard.
123.823	The light from the star is diffracting.
126.143	It's scattering inside the telescope,
127.884	creating that very bright image
129.388	that washes out the planet.
131.14	So to see the planet,
132.411	we have to do something about all of that light.
134.671	We have to get rid of it.
135.902	I have a lot of colleagues working on
137.347	really amazing technologies to do that,
139.362	but I want to tell you about one today
141.177	that I think is the coolest,
142.674	and probably the most likely to get us an Earth
144.874	in the next decade.
146.41	It was first suggested by Lyman Spitzer,
148.482	the father of the space telescope, in 1962,
151.642	and he took his inspiration from an eclipse.
153.758	You've all seen that. That's a solar eclipse.
155.941	The moon has moved in front of the sun.
157.981	It blocks out most of the light
159.741	so we can see that dim corona around it.
162.117	It would be the same thing if I put my thumb up
163.78	and blocked that spotlight
163.78	that's getting right in my eye,
166.365	I can see you in the back row.
168.277	Well, what's going on?
169.579	Well the moon
171.524	is casting a shadow down on the Earth.
173.939	We put a telescope or a camera in that shadow,
177.174	we look back at the sun,
178.685	and most of the light's been removed
180.325	and we can see that dim, fine structure
182.415	in the corona.
183.69	Spitzer's suggestion was we do this in space.
186.357	We build a big screen, we fly it in space,
189.134	we put it up in front of the star,
191.181	we block out most of the light,
192.965	we fly a space telescope in
192.965	that shadow that's created,
195.981	and boom, we get to see planets.
197.758	Well that would look something like this.
200.421	So there's that big screen,
202.01	and there's no planets,
202.885	because unfortunately it doesn't
202.885	actually work very well,
205.389	because the light waves of the light and waves
208.309	diffracts around that screen
209.989	the same way it did in the telescope.
211.773	It's like water bending around a rock in a stream,
214.91	and all that light just destroys the shadow.
216.7	It's a terrible shadow. And we can't see planets.
219.373	But Spitzer actually knew the answer.
221.14	If we can feather the edges, soften those edges
223.645	so we can control diffraction,
225.411	well then we can see a planet,
227.126	and in the last 10 years or so we've come up
228.925	with optimal solutions for doing that.
230.969	It looks something like that.
234.501	We call that our flower petal starshade.
236.846	If we make the edges of those petals exactly right,
239.806	if we control their shape,
241.23	we can control diffraction,
242.788	and now we have a great shadow.
244.234	It's about 10 billion times dimmer than it was before,
246.878	and we can see the planets beam out just like that.
250.324	That, of course, has to be bigger than my thumb.
252.182	That starshade is about
253.64	the size of half a football field
255.216	and it has to fly 50,000 kilometers
255.216	away from the telescope
258.806	that has to be held right in its shadow,
260.866	and then we can see those planets.
262.83	This sounds formidable,
264.238	but brilliant engineers, colleagues of mine at JPL,
267.246	came up with a fabulous design for how to do that
270.126	and it looks like this.
271.2	It starts wrapped around a hub.
272.988	It separates from the telescope.
274.967	The petals unfurl, they open up,
277.238	the telescope turns around.
278.998	Then you'll see it flip and fly out
281.142	that 50,000 kilometers away from the telescope.
284.357	It's going to move in front of the star
286.827	just like that, creates a wonderful shadow.
290.11	Boom, we get planets orbiting about it.
293.914	(Applause)
295.638	Thank you.
297.997	That's not science fiction.
299.95	We've been working on this
299.95	for the last five or six years.
302.513	Last summer, we did a really cool test
305.116	out in California at Northrop Grumman.
307.555	So those are four petals.
309.138	This is a sub-scale star shade.
310.85	It's about half the size of the one you just saw.
313.347	You'll see the petals unfurl.
314.807	Those four petals were built by four undergraduates
316.874	doing a summer internship at JPL.
319.289	Now you're seeing it deploy.
320.535	Those petals have to rotate into place.
322.517	The base of those petals
323.687	has to go to the same place every time
326.06	to within a tenth of a millimeter.
327.683	We ran this test 16 times,
329.443	and 16 times it went into the exact same place
332.282	to a tenth of a millimeter.
333.723	This has to be done very precisely,
335.655	but if we can do this, if we can build this technology,
338.163	if we can get it into space,
339.647	you might see something like this.
341.448	That's a picture of one our nearest neighbor stars
343.72	taken with the Hubble Space Telescope.
346.314	If we can take a similar space telescope,
348.698	slightly larger,
349.956	put it out there,
351.378	fly an occulter in front of it,
352.764	what we might see is something like that --
354.954	that's a family portrait of our
354.954	solar system -- but not ours.
357.89	We're hoping it'll be someone else's solar system
360.412	as seen through an occulter,
362.044	through a starshade like that.
363.114	You can see Jupiter, you can see Saturn,
365.139	Uranus, Neptune, and right there in the center,
367.762	next to the residual light
369.102	is that pale blue dot. That's Earth.
371.007	We want to see that, see if there's water,
373.381	oxygen, ozone,
374.786	the things that might tell us that it could harbor life.
377.309	I think this is the coolest possible science.
379.718	That's why I got into doing this,
381.371	because I think that will change the world.
383.341	That will change everything when we see that.
385.779	Thank you.
387.365	(Applause)
