12.825	Have you ever noticed
12.825	when you ask someone to talk
15.2	about a change they're making
15.2	for the better in their personal lives,
18.56	they're often really energetic?
21.015	Whether it's training for a marathon,
23.52	picking up an old hobby,
24.8	or learning a new skill,
26.68	for most people,
27.96	self-transformation projects
27.96	occupy a very positive emotional space.
33.72	Self-transformation is empowering,
36.2	energizing, even exhilarating.
38.56	I mean just take a look
38.56	at some of the titles of self-help books:
42.36	"""Awaken the Giant Within,"""
45.08	"""Practicing the Power of Now,"""
47.6	or here's a great one
47.6	we can all relate to,
50.08	"""You are a Badass:"
52.32	How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness
52.32	"and Start Living an Awesome Life."""
57.44	(Laughter)
60.04	When it comes to self-transformation,
63.24	you can't help but get
63.24	a sense of the excitement.
68.84	But there's another type of transformation
72.04	that occupies a very different
72.04	emotional space.
76.08	The transformation of organizations.
79.88	If you're like most people,
81.24	"when you hear the words ""Our organization"
81.24	"is going to start a transformation,"""
85.64	"you're thinking, ""Uh-oh."""
87.426	(Laughter)
88.6	"""Layoffs."""
90.8	The blood drains from your face,
92.76	your mind goes into overdrive,
95.64	frantically searching
95.64	for some place to run and hide.
100.12	Well, you can run,
101.64	but you really can't hide.
104.04	Most of us spend
104.04	the majority of our waking hours
107.04	involved in organizations.
109.04	And due to changes in globalization,
112.16	changes due to advances in technology
114.72	and other factors,
116.56	the reality is our organizations
116.56	are constantly having to adapt.
122.36	In fact,
123.6	I call this the era
123.6	"of ""always-on"" transformation."
129.4	When I shared this idea
129.4	with my wife Nicola,
131.68	"she said, ""Always-on transformation?"
134.84	"That sounds exhausting."""
137.64	And that may be
137.64	exactly what you're thinking --
139.96	and you would be right.
141.56	Particularly if we continue to approach
141.56	the transformation of organizations
146.72	the way we always have been.
148.92	But because we can't hide,
151.36	we need to sort out two things.
153.08	First,
154.32	why is transformation so exhausting?
157.08	And second, how do we fix it?
161.2	First of all,
162.44	let's acknowledge that change is hard.
165.6	People naturally resist change,
167.64	especially when it's imposed on them.
171.2	But there are things that organizations do
171.2	that make change even harder
175.8	and more exhausting
175.8	for people than it needs to be.
179.72	First of all,
180.96	leaders often wait too long to act.
185.04	As a result,
186.28	everything is happening in crisis mode.
190.32	Which, of course, tends to be exhausting.
193.36	Or, given the urgency,
196.48	what they'll do is they'll just focus
196.48	on the short-term results,
201.32	but that doesn't give
201.32	any hope for the future.
204.56	Or they'll just take
204.56	a superficial, one-off approach,
209.04	hoping that they can return
209.04	back to business as usual
213.16	as soon as the crisis is over.
217.6	This kind of approach
218.84	is kind of the way some students
218.84	approach preparing for standardized tests.
226.28	In order to get test scores to go up,
229.76	teachers will end up teaching to the test.
233.16	Now, that approach can work;
234.56	test results often do go up.
236.52	But it fails the fundamental
236.52	goal of education:
240.32	to prepare students
240.32	to succeed over the long term.
246.68	So given these obstacles,
250.16	what can we do
252	to transform the way
252	we transform organizations
255.48	so rather than being exhausting,
258.2	it's actually empowering and energizing?
262.16	To do that, we need to focus
262.16	on five strategic imperatives,
267.2	all of which have one thing in common:
269.959	putting people first.
273.079	The first imperative
273.079	for putting people first
275.76	is to inspire through purpose.
278.12	Most transformations have
278.12	financial and operational goals.
281.84	These are important
281.84	and they can be energizing to leaders,
286.12	but they tend not to be very motivating
286.12	to most people in the organization.
290.48	To motivate more broadly,
292.28	the transformation needs to connect
292.28	with a deeper sense of purpose.
297.72	Take LEGO.
299.64	The LEGO Group has become
299.64	an extraordinary global company.
304.52	Under their very capable leadership,
306.28	they've actually undergone
306.28	a series of transformations.
309.8	While each of these
309.8	has had a very specific focus,
313.04	the North Star,
314.36	linking and guiding all of them,
316.2	has been Lego's powerful purpose:
319.48	inspire and develop
319.48	the builders of tomorrow.
324.36	Expanding globally?
326.16	It's not about increasing sales,
328.6	but about giving millions of additional
328.6	children access to LEGO building bricks.
333.96	Investment and innovation?
335.96	It's not about developing new products,
338.36	but about enabling more children
340.68	to experience the joy
340.68	of learning through play.
345.44	Not surprisingly,
347	that deep sense of purpose tends
347	to be highly motivating to LEGO's people.
354.12	The second imperative
354.12	for putting people first
357.08	is to go all in.
360.08	Too many transformations
361.8	are nothing more than
361.8	head-count cutting exercises;
365.56	layoffs under the guise of transformation.
369.96	In the face of relentless competition,
372.04	it may well be that you will
372.04	have to take the painful decision
376	to downsize the organization,
378.88	just as you may have to lose some weight
378.88	in order to run a marathon.
384	But losing weight alone
385.24	will not get you across
385.24	the finish line with a winning time.
388.56	To win
390.16	you need to go all in.
392.88	You need to go all in.
397.16	Rather than just cutting costs,
399.64	you need to think about initiatives
402.2	that will enable you
402.2	to win in the medium term,
404.92	initiatives to drive growth,
406.92	actions that will fundamentally
406.92	change the way the company operates,
411	and very importantly,
412.56	investments to develop
412.56	the leadership and the talent.
418.68	The third imperative
418.68	for putting people first
422.48	is to enable people with the capabilities
425.2	that they need to succeed
425.2	during the transformation and beyond.
432.28	Over the years I've competed
432.28	in a number of triathlons.
436.28	You know, frankly, I'm not that good,
438.48	but I do have one distinct capability;
442.52	I am remarkably fast at finding my bike.
446.64	(Laughter)
448.56	By the time I finish the swim,
450.4	almost all the bikes are already gone.
452.28	(Laughter)
456.16	Real triathletes know that each leg --
460.24	the swim, the bike, the run --
462	really requires different capabilities,
464.52	different tools,
465.76	different skills, different techniques.
468.44	Likewise when we transform organizations,
470.92	we need to be sure
470.92	that we're giving our people
473.8	the skills and the tools
473.8	they need along the way.
478.16	Chronos,
479.4	a global software company,
481.4	recognized the need
481.4	to transfer from building products --
486.36	software products --
488.04	to building software as a service.
491.8	To enable its people
491.8	to take that transformation,
495.04	first of all they invested in new tools
497.76	that would enable their employees
497.76	to monitor the usage of the features
502.84	as well as customer satisfaction
502.84	with the new service.
506.28	They also invested in skill development,
510	so that their employees would be able
511.84	to resolve customer service
511.84	problems on the spot.
514.96	And very importantly,
516.2	they also reinforced the collaborative
516.2	behaviors that would be required
519.6	to deliver an end-to-end
519.6	seamless customer experience.
524.679	Because of these investments,
526.28	rather than feeling overwhelmed
526.28	by the transformation,
529.64	Chronos employees actually felt energized
532.919	and empowered in their new roles.
536.2	"In the era of ""always-on"" transformation,"
538.44	change is a constant.
539.96	My fourth imperative therefore
541.92	is to instill a culture
541.92	of continuous learning.
546.8	When Satya Nadella
546.8	became the CEO of Microsoft
549.84	in February 2014,
551.8	he embarked on an ambitious
551.8	transformation journey
554.72	to prepare the company to compete
554.72	in a mobile-first, cloud-first world.
559.64	This included changes to strategy,
561.96	the organization
563.2	and very importantly, the culture.
566.28	Microsoft's culture at the time was one
566.28	of silos and internal competition --
571.32	not exactly conducive to learning.
574.48	Nadella took this head-on.
577.56	He rallied his leadership
577.56	around his vision
581	for a living, learning culture,
584.24	shifting from a fixed mindset,
586.6	where your role was to show up
586.6	as the smartest person in the room,
590	to a growth mindset,
591.84	where your role was to listen, to learn
591.84	and to bring out the best in people.
598.72	Well, early days,
600	Microsoft employees already
600	noticed this shift in the culture --
604.08	clear evidence of Microsoft
604.08	putting people first.
608.56	My fifth and final imperative
608.56	is specifically for leaders.
613.2	In a transformation,
614.88	a leader needs to have a vision,
617.16	a clear road map with milestones,
620.6	and then you need to hold people
620.6	accountable for results.
625.08	In other words, you need to be directive.
628.24	But in order to capture
628.24	the hearts and minds of people,
631.4	you also need to be inclusive.
634.68	Inclusive leadership
634.68	is critical to putting people first.
639.92	I live in the San Francisco Bay area.
642.68	And right now,
643.92	our basketball team
643.92	is the best in the league.
646.96	We won the 2015 championship,
649.64	and we're favored to win again this year.
652.6	There are many explanations for this.
654.68	They have some fabulous players,
657.12	but one of the key reasons
658.92	is their head coach, Steve Kerr,
658.92	is an inclusive leader.
665.36	When Kerr came to the Warriors in 2014,
668	the Warriors were looking
668	for a major transformation.
671.48	They hadn't won a national
671.48	championship since 1975.
677.64	Kerr came in, and he had a clear vision,
680.84	and he immediately got to work.
684.48	From the outset,
685.84	he reached out and engaged
685.84	the players and the staff.
689.96	He created an environment of open debate
689.96	and solicited suggestions.
695.36	During games he would often ask,
697.08	"""What are you seeing that I'm missing?"""
700	One the best examples of this
700	came in game four of the 2015 finals.
706.6	The Warriors were down two games to one
709.88	when Kerr made the decision
709.88	to change the starting lineup;
714.6	a bold move by any measure.
719.36	The Warriors won the game
719.36	and went on to win the championship.
722.96	And it is widely viewed
724.24	that that move was
724.24	the pivotal move in their victory.
729.44	Interestingly, it wasn't
729.44	actually Kerr's idea.
734.56	It was the idea of his 28-year-old
734.56	assistant, Nick U'Ren.
739.16	Because of Kerr's leadership style,
741.36	U'Ren felt comfortable
741.36	bringing the idea forward.
745.24	And Kerr not only listened,
747.24	but he implemented the idea
749.52	and then afterwards,
751.2	gave U'Ren all the credit --
754.52	actions all consistent with Kerr's
754.52	highly inclusive approach to leadership.
761.28	"In the era of ""always-on"" transformation,"
763.96	organizations are always
763.96	going to be transforming.
769.2	But doing so does not
769.2	have to be exhausting.
774.08	We owe it to ourselves,
776.28	to our organizations
778.28	and to society more broadly
781	to boldly transform
781	our approach to transformation.
785.92	To do that,
787.6	we need to start putting people first.
791.8	Thank you.
793.04	(Applause)
