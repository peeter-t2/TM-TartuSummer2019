12.9	Today I want to talk
12.9	about the meaning of words,
16.42	how we define them
17.74	and how they, almost as revenge,
20.02	define us.
21.3	The English language
21.3	is a magnificent sponge.
24.38	I love the English language.
24.38	I'm glad that I speak it.
27.06	But for all that, it has a lot of holes.
30.3	"In Greek, there's a word, ""lachesism"""
32.66	which is the hunger for disaster.
36.54	You know, when you see
36.54	a thunderstorm on the horizon
40.14	and you just find yourself
40.14	rooting for the storm.
43.9	"In Mandarin, they have a word ""yù yī"" --"
45.86	I'm not pronouncing that correctly --
47.9	which means the longing
47.9	to feel intensely again
51.62	the way you did when you were a kid.
55.5	"In Polish, they have a word ""jouska"""
58.66	which is the kind of
58.66	hypothetical conversation
62.22	that you compulsively
62.22	play out in your head.
66.22	And finally, in German,
66.22	of course in German,
69.38	"they have a word called ""zielschmerz"""
72.26	which is the dread
72.26	of getting what you want.
75.7	(Laughter)
79.82	Finally fulfilling a lifelong dream.
83.66	I'm German myself,
83.66	so I know exactly what that feels like.
86.94	Now, I'm not sure
86.94	if I would use any of these words
89.58	as I go about my day,
91.26	but I'm really glad they exist.
93.42	But the only reason they exist
93.42	is because I made them up.
97.18	"I am the author of ""The Dictionary"
97.18	"of Obscure Sorrows,"""
100.82	which I've been writing
100.82	for the last seven years.
103.94	And the whole mission of the project
105.98	is to find holes
105.98	in the language of emotion
111.18	and try to fill them
112.42	so that we have a way of talking
112.42	about all those human peccadilloes
116.34	and quirks of the human condition
118.78	that we all feel
118.78	but may not think to talk about
122.78	because we don't have the words to do it.
125.5	And about halfway through this project,
127.94	"I defined ""sonder,"""
129.58	the idea that we all think of ourselves
129.58	as the main character
132.98	and everyone else is just extras.
135.66	But in reality,
135.66	we're all the main character,
138.38	and you yourself are an extra
138.38	in someone else's story.
142.98	And so as soon as I published that,
146.1	I got a lot of response from people
147.82	"saying, ""Thank you for giving voice"
147.82	to something I had felt all my life
152.46	"but there was no word for that."""
155.5	So it made them feel less alone.
157.98	That's the power of words,
160.7	to make us feel less alone.
164.22	And it was not long after that
165.98	that I started to notice sonder
167.78	being used earnestly
167.78	in conversations online,
172.1	and not long after I actually noticed it,
175.02	I caught it next to me
175.02	in an actual conversation in person.
178.54	There is no stranger feeling
178.54	than making up a word
181.02	and then seeing it
181.02	take on a mind of its own.
185.34	I don't have a word
185.34	for that yet, but I will.
187.46	(Laughter)
188.9	I'm working on it.
191.42	I started to think
191.42	about what makes words real,
195.38	because a lot of people ask me,
196.9	the most common thing
196.9	I got from people is,
199.26	"""Well, are these words made up?"
199.26	"I don't really understand."""
202.54	And I didn't really know what to tell them
204.62	because once sonder started to take off,
206.58	who am I to say what words
206.58	are real and what aren't.
209.98	And so I sort of felt like Steve Jobs,
209.98	who described his epiphany
214.06	as when he realized that most of us,
214.06	as we go through the day,
217.54	we just try to avoid
217.54	bouncing against the walls too much
220.58	and just sort of get on with things.
223.7	But once you realize that people --
228.1	that this world was built
228.1	by people no smarter than you,
231.9	then you can reach out
231.9	and touch those walls
234.02	and even put your hand through them
235.74	and realize that you have
235.74	the power to change it.
238.9	And when people ask me,
238.9	"""Are these words real?"""
242.58	I had a variety of answers
242.58	that I tried out.
244.7	Some of them made sense.
244.7	Some of them didn't.
246.86	But one of them I tried out was,
248.46	"""Well, a word is real"
248.46	"if you want it to be real."""
252.02	The way that this path is real
252.02	because people wanted it to be there.
256.26	(Laughter)
257.98	It happens on college
257.98	campuses all the time.
260.1	"It's called a ""desire path."""
261.46	(Laughter)
262.5	But then I decided,
262.5	what people are really asking
264.86	when they're asking if a word is real,
264.86	they're really asking,
267.78	"""Well, how many brains"
267.78	"will this give me access to?"""
272.899	Because I think that's
272.899	a lot of how we look at language.
275.66	A word is essentially a key
278.46	that gets us into certain people's heads.
281.46	And if it gets us into one brain,
284.74	it's not really worth it,
286.02	not really worth knowing.
287.3	Two brains, eh, it depends on who it is.
289.78	A million brains, OK, now we're talking.
292.62	And so a real word is one that gets you
292.62	access to as many brains as you can.
299.1	That's what makes it worth knowing.
302.38	Incidentally, the realest word of all
302.38	by this measure is this.
306.22	[O.K.]
308.46	That's it.
309.7	The realest word we have.
310.98	That is the closest thing we have
310.98	to a master key.
313.58	That's the most commonly
313.58	understood word in the world,
316.18	no matter where you are.
317.46	The problem with that is,
318.7	no one seems to know
318.7	what those two letters stand for.
321.42	(Laughter)
323.74	Which is kind of weird, right?
325.82	I mean, it could be a misspelling
325.82	"of ""all correct,"" I guess,"
329.3	"or ""old kinderhook."""
330.58	No one really seems to know,
330.58	but the fact that it doesn't matter
334.46	says something about
334.46	how we add meaning to words.
337.98	The meaning is not
337.98	in the words themselves.
341.74	We're the ones
341.74	that pour ourselves into it.
345.26	And I think, when we're all searching
345.26	for meaning in our lives,
349.86	and searching for the meaning of life,
351.74	I think words have
351.74	something to do with that.
355.86	And I think if you're looking
355.86	for the meaning of something,
358.66	the dictionary is a decent place to start.
361.58	It brings a sense of order
363.98	to a very chaotic universe.
366.7	Our view of things is so limited
369.38	that we have to come up
369.38	with patterns and shorthands
372.18	and try to figure out
372.18	a way to interpret it
374.5	and be able to get on with our day.
377.06	We need words to contain us,
377.06	to define ourselves.
381.22	I think a lot of us feel boxed in
384.14	by how we use these words.
385.74	We forget that words are made up.
388.1	It's not just my words.
388.1	All words are made up,
391.1	but not all of them mean something.
393.7	We're all just sort of
393.7	trapped in our own lexicons
397.82	that don't necessarily correlate
397.82	with people who aren't already like us,
402.58	and so I think I feel us drifting apart
402.58	a little more every year,
407.22	the more seriously we take words.
411.7	Because remember, words are not real.
415.42	They don't have meaning. We do.
418.3	And I'd like to leave you with a reading
421.58	from one of my favorite philosophers,
424.22	Bill Watterson, who created
424.22	"""Calvin and Hobbes."""
426.78	He said,
428.86	"""Creating a life that reflects"
428.86	your values and satisfies your soul
432.7	is a rare achievement.
434.38	To invent your own life's meaning
436.86	is not easy,
438.42	but it is still allowed,
440.26	and I think you'll be
440.26	"happier for the trouble."""
443.14	Thank you.
444.38	(Applause)
