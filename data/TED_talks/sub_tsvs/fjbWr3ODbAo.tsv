26	So I'm going to speak about a problem that I have
29	and that's that I'm a philosopher.
32	(Laughter)
34	When I go to a party and people ask me what do I do
37	"and I say, ""I'm a professor,"" their eyes glaze over."
42	When I go to an academic cocktail party
44	and there are all the professors around, they ask me what field I'm in
48	"and I say, ""philosophy"" -- their eyes glaze over."
51	(Laughter)
53	When I go to a philosopher's party
56	(Laughter)
59	"and they ask me what I work on and I say, ""consciousness,"""
63	their eyes don't glaze over -- their lips curl into a snarl.
68	(Laughter)
69	And I get hoots of derision and cackles and growls
75	"because they think, ""That's impossible! You can't explain consciousness."""
80	The very chutzpah of somebody thinking
82	that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question.
86	My late, lamented friend Bob Nozick, a fine philosopher,
90	"in one of his books, ""Philosophical Explanations,"""
94	is commenting on the ethos of philosophy --
99	the way philosophers go about their business.
101	"And he says, you know, ""Philosophers love rational argument."""
105	"And he says, ""It seems as if the ideal argument"
107	for most philosophers is you give your audience the premises
113	and then you give them the inferences and the conclusion,
118	and if they don't accept the conclusion, they die.
122	"Their heads explode."" The idea is to have an argument"
125	that is so powerful that it knocks out your opponents.
129	But in fact that doesn't change people's minds at all.
132	It's very hard to change people's minds
133	about something like consciousness,
135	and I finally figured out the reason for that.
140	The reason for that is that everybody's an expert on consciousness.
144	We heard the other day that everybody's got a strong opinion about video games.
148	They all have an idea for a video game, even if they're not experts.
151	But they don't consider themselves experts on video games;
154	they've just got strong opinions.
155	I'm sure that people here who work on, say, climate change
160	and global warming, or on the future of the Internet,
165	encounter people who have very strong opinions
167	about what's going to happen next.
170	But they probably don't think of these opinions as expertise.
174	They're just strongly held opinions.
176	But with regard to consciousness, people seem to think,
180	"each of us seems to think, ""I am an expert."
183	"Simply by being conscious, I know all about this."""
186	And so, you tell them your theory and they say,
188	"""No, no, that's not the way consciousness is!"
189	"No, you've got it all wrong."""
191	And they say this with an amazing confidence.
195	And so what I'm going to try to do today
197	is to shake your confidence. Because I know the feeling --
200	I can feel it myself.
202	I want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds --
208	that you are, yourselves, authoritative about your own consciousness.
213	That's the order of the day here.
216	Now, this nice picture shows a thought-balloon, a thought-bubble.
219	I think everybody understands what that means.
221	That's supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness.
224	This is my favorite picture of consciousness that's ever been done.
226	It's a Saul Steinberg of course -- it was a New Yorker cover.
229	And this fellow here is looking at the painting by Braque.
234	That reminds him of the word baroque, barrack, bark, poodle,
238	Suzanne R. -- he's off to the races.
240	There's a wonderful stream of consciousness here
244	and if you follow it along, you learn a lot about this man.
248	What I particularly like about this picture, too,
250	is that Steinberg has rendered the guy
252	in this sort of pointillist style.
255	Which reminds us, as Rod Brooks was saying yesterday:
258	what we are, what each of us is -- what you are, what I am --
262	is approximately 100 trillion little cellular robots.
268	That's what we're made of.
270	No other ingredients at all. We're just made of cells, about 100 trillion of them.
274	Not a single one of those cells is conscious;
276	not a single one of those cells knows who you are, or cares.
281	Somehow, we have to explain
283	how when you put together teams, armies, battalions
287	of hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells --
291	not so different really from a bacterium, each one of them --
295	the result is this. I mean, just look at it.
299	The content -- there's color, there's ideas, there's memories,
303	there's history. And somehow all that content of consciousness
307	is accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons.
312	How is that possible? Many people just think it isn't possible at all.
316	"They think, ""No, there can't be any"
318	"sort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness."""
322	This is a lovely book by a friend of mine named Lee Siegel,
325	who's a professor of religion, actually, at the University of Hawaii,
328	and he's an expert magician, and an expert
330	on the street magic of India, which is what this book is about,
334	"""Net of Magic."""
336	And there's a passage in it which I would love to share with you.
339	It speaks so eloquently to the problem.
345	"""'I'm writing a book on magic,' I explain, and I'm asked, 'Real magic?'"
350	By 'real magic,' people mean miracles,
352	thaumaturgical acts, and supernatural powers.
354	'No,' I answer. 'Conjuring tricks, not real magic.'
358	'Real magic,' in other words, refers to the magic that is not real;
362	"while the magic that is real, that can actually be done, is not real magic."""
367	(Laughter)
371	Now, that's the way a lot of people feel about consciousness.
375	(Laughter)
376	Real consciousness is not a bag of tricks.
378	If you're going to explain this as a bag of tricks,
380	then it's not real consciousness, whatever it is.
383	And, as Marvin said, and as other people have said,
389	"""Consciousness is a bag of tricks."""
392	This means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfied
397	and incredulous when I attempt to explain consciousness.
400	So this is the problem. So I have to
403	do a little bit of the sort of work
406	that a lot of you won't like,
410	for the same reason that you don't like to see
412	a magic trick explained to you.
414	How many of you here, if somebody -- some smart aleck --
418	starts telling you how a particular magic trick is done,
421	"you sort of want to block your ears and say, ""No, no, I don't want to know!"
424	Don't take the thrill of it away. I'd rather be mystified.
427	"Don't tell me the answer."""
430	A lot of people feel that way about consciousness, I've discovered.
433	And I'm sorry if I impose some clarity, some understanding on you.
439	You'd better leave now if you don't want to know some of these tricks.
444	But I'm not going to explain it all to you.
448	I'm going to do what philosophers do.
451	Here's how a philosopher explains the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick.
457	You know the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick?
459	"The philosopher says, ""I'm going to explain to you how that's done."
463	"You see, the magician doesn't really saw the lady in half."""
468	(Laughter)
470	"""He merely makes you think that he does."""
474	"And you say, ""Yes, and how does he do that?"""
475	"He says, ""Oh, that's not my department, I'm sorry."""
477	(Laughter)
482	So now I'm going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness.
485	But I'm going to try to also show you
488	that consciousness isn't quite as marvelous --
491	your own consciousness isn't quite as wonderful --
493	as you may have thought it is.
495	This is something, by the way, that Lee Siegel talks about in his book.
499	He marvels at how he'll do a magic show, and afterwards
503	people will swear they saw him do X, Y, and Z. He never did those things.
507	He didn't even try to do those things.
509	People's memories inflate what they think they saw.
513	And the same is true of consciousness.
516	Now, let's see if this will work. All right. Let's just watch this.
523	Watch it carefully.
536	I'm working with a young computer-animator documentarian
539	named Nick Deamer, and this is a little demo that he's done for me,
544	part of a larger project some of you may be interested in.
547	We're looking for a backer.
550	It's a feature-length documentary on consciousness.
554	OK, now, you all saw what changed, right?
560	How many of you noticed that every one of those squares changed color?
565	Every one. I'll just show you by running it again.
574	Even when you know that they're all going to change color,
579	it's very hard to notice. You have to really concentrate
583	to pick up any of the changes at all.
586	Now, this is an example -- one of many --
591	of a phenomenon that's now being studied quite a bit.
593	It's one that I predicted in the last page or two of my
599	where I said if you did experiments of this sort,
602	you'd find that people were unable to pick up really large changes.
605	If there's time at the end,
607	I'll show you the much more dramatic case.
610	Now, how can it be that there are all those changes going on,
615	and that we're not aware of them?
618	Well, earlier today, Jeff Hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades,
623	the way your eye moves around three or four times a second.
626	He didn't mention the speed. Your eye is constantly in motion,
629	moving around, looking at eyes, noses, elbows,
632	looking at interesting things in the world.
634	And where your eye isn't looking,
636	you're remarkably impoverished in your vision.
639	That's because the foveal part of your eye,
642	which is the high-resolution part,
644	is only about the size of your thumbnail held at arms length.
647	That's the detail part.
649	It doesn't seem that way, does it?
652	It doesn't seem that way, but that's the way it is.
654	You're getting in a lot less information than you think.
658	Here's a completely different effect. This is a painting by Bellotto.
664	It's in the museum in North Carolina.
666	Bellotto was a student of Canaletto's.
669	And I love paintings like that --
670	the painting is actually about as big as it is right here.
674	And I love Canalettos, because Canaletto has this fantastic detail,
677	and you can get right up
680	and see all the details on the painting.
683	And I started across the hall in North Carolina,
688	because I thought it was probably a Canaletto,
690	and would have all that in detail.
692	And I noticed that on the bridge there, there's a lot of people --
695	you can just barely see them walking across the bridge.
698	And I thought as I got closer
699	I would be able to see all the detail of most people,
702	see their clothes, and so forth.
704	And as I got closer and closer, I actually screamed.
708	I yelled out because when I got closer,
710	I found the detail wasn't there at all.
714	There were just little artfully placed blobs of paint.
718	And as I walked towards the picture,
721	I was expecting detail that wasn't there.
724	The artist had very cleverly suggested people and clothes
729	and wagons and all sorts of things,
732	and my brain had taken the suggestion.
735	You're familiar with a more recent technology, which is -- There,
741	you can get a better view of the blobs.
743	See, when you get close
745	they're really just blobs of paint.
750	You will have seen something like this -- this is the reverse effect.
764	I'll just give that to you one more time.
767	Now, what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion?
774	When an artful blob of paint or two, by an artist,
779	suggests a person -- say, one of
785	Marvin Minsky's little society of mind --
787	do they send little painters out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere?
792	I don't think so. Not a chance. But then, how on Earth is it done?
797	Well, remember the philosopher's explanation of the lady?
802	It's the same thing.
805	The brain just makes you think that it's got the detail there.
808	You think the detail's there, but it isn't there.
811	The brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all.
814	It's just making you expect the detail.
817	Let's just do this experiment very quickly.
820	Is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right, rotated?
825	Yes.
827	How many of you did it by rotating the one on the left
829	in your mind's eye, to see if it matched up with the one on the right?
832	How many of you rotated the one on the right? OK.
836	How do you know that's what you did?
838	(Laughter)
841	There's in fact been a very interesting debate
843	raging for over 20 years in cognitive science --
846	various experiments started by Roger Shepherd,
848	who measured the angular velocity of rotation of mental images.
853	Yes, it's possible to do that.
855	But the details of the process are still in significant controversy.
862	And if you read that literature, one of the things
865	that you really have to come to terms with is
868	even when you're the subject in the experiment, you don't know.
870	You don't know how you do it.
872	You just know that you have certain beliefs.
875	And they come in a certain order, at a certain time.
878	And what explains the fact that that's what you think?
880	Well, that's where you have to go backstage and ask the magician.
884	This is a figure that I love: Bradley, Petrie, and Dumais.
888	You may think that I've cheated,
890	that I've put a little whiter-than-white boundary there.
895	How many of you see that sort of boundary,
897	with the Necker cube floating in front of the circles?
900	Can you see it?
902	Well, you know, in effect, the boundary's really there, in a certain sense.
907	Your brain is actually computing that boundary,
910	the boundary that goes right there.
915	But now, notice there are two ways of seeing the cube, right?
917	It's a Necker cube.
919	Everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube? OK.
923	Can you see the four ways of seeing the cube?
927	Because there's another way of seeing it.
929	If you're seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles,
932	some black circles, there's another way of seeing it.
935	As a cube, on a black background,
937	as seen through a piece of Swiss cheese.
939	(Laughter)
942	Can you get it? How many of you can't get it? That'll help.
948	(Laughter)
950	Now you can get it. These are two very different phenomena.
955	When you see the cube one way, behind the screen,
961	those boundaries go away.
963	But there's still a sort of filling in, as we can tell if we look at this.
968	We don't have any trouble seeing the cube, but where does the color change?
972	Does your brain have to send little painters in there?
975	The purple-painters and the green-painters
977	fight over who's going to paint that bit behind the curtain? No.
980	Your brain just lets it go. The brain doesn't need to fill that in.
989	When I first started talking about
992	the Bradley, Petrie, Dumais example that you just saw --
996	I'll go back to it, this one --
1000	I said that there was no filling-in behind there.
1007	And I supposed that that was just a flat truth, always true.
1010	But Rob Van Lier has recently shown that it isn't.
1015	Now, if you think you see some pale yellow --
1020	I'll run this a few more times.
1022	Look in the gray areas,
1026	and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there --
1031	yeah, it's amazing. There's nothing there. It's no trick.
1038	"[""Failure to Detect Changes in Scenes"" slide]"
1044	This is Ron Rensink's work, which was in some degree
1046	inspired by that suggestion right at the end of the book.
1050	Let me just pause this for a second if I can.
1052	This is change-blindness.
1054	What you're going to see is two pictures,
1056	one of which is slightly different from the other.
1058	You see here the red roof and the gray roof,
1061	and in between them there will be a mask,
1063	which is just a blank screen, for about a quarter of a second.
1067	So you'll see the first picture, then a mask,
1069	then the second picture, then a mask.
1071	And this will just continue, and your job as the subject
1075	is to press the button when you see the change.
1078	So, show the original picture for 240 milliseconds. Blank.
1086	Show the next picture for 240 milliseconds. Blank.
1092	And keep going, until the subject presses the button, saying,
1096	"""I see the change."""
1098	So now we're going to be subjects in the experiment.
1101	We're going to start easy. Some examples.
1110	No trouble there.
1112	Can everybody see? All right.
1115	Indeed, Rensink's subjects took only a little bit more
1119	than a second to press the button.
1126	Can you see that one?
1135	2.9 seconds.
1144	How many don't see it still?
1147	What's on the roof of that barn?
1149	(Laughter)
1160	It's easy.
1186	Is it a bridge or a dock?
1192	There are a few more really dramatic ones, and then I'll close.
1196	I want you to see a few that are particularly striking.
1200	This one because it's so large and yet it's pretty hard to see.
1207	Can you see it?
1210	Audience: Yes.
1212	Dan Dennett: See the shadows going back and forth? Pretty big.
1223	So 15.5 seconds is the median time
1227	for subjects in his experiment there.
1229	I love this one. I'll end with this one,
1232	just because it's such an obvious and important thing.
1237	How many still don't see it? How many still don't see it?
1243	How many engines on the wing of that Boeing?
1246	(Laughter)
1247	Right in the middle of the picture!
1253	Thanks very much for your attention.
1254	What I wanted to show you is that scientists,
1259	using their from-the-outside, third-person methods,
1263	can tell you things about your own consciousness
1265	that you would never dream of,
1267	and that, in fact, you're not the authority
1269	on your own consciousness that you think you are.
1271	And we're really making a lot of progress
1273	on coming up with a theory of mind.
1276	Jeff Hawkins, this morning, was describing his attempt
1282	to get theory, and a good, big theory, into the neuroscience.
1286	And he's right. This is a problem.
1291	Harvard Medical School once -- I was at a talk --
1293	"director of the lab said, ""In our lab, we have a saying."
1297	If you work on one neuron, that's neuroscience.
1300	"If you work on two neurons, that's psychology."""
1303	(Laughter)
1307	We have to have more theory, and it can come as much from the top down.
1310	Thank you very much.
1312	(Applause)
