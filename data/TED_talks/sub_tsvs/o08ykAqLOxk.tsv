12.452	Do you think the world is going
12.452	to be a better place next year?
18.12	In the next decade?
20.657	Can we end hunger,
23.444	achieve gender equality,
25.999	halt climate change,
28.145	all in the next 15 years?
31.764	Well, according to the governments
31.764	of the world, yes we can.
36.343	In the last few days,
36.343	the leaders of the world,
38.985	meeting at the UN in New York,
41.485	agreed a new set of Global Goals
44.264	for the development of the world to 2030.
47.493	And here they are:
48.94	these goals are the product
48.94	of a massive consultation exercise.
53.658	The Global Goals are who we,
53.658	humanity, want to be.
59.423	Now that's the plan, but can we get there?
63.599	Can this vision for a better world
63.599	really be achieved?
68.247	Well, I'm here today because
68.247	we've run the numbers,
72.031	and the answer, shockingly,
76.599	is that maybe we actually can.
79.599	But not with business as usual.
83.757	Now, the idea that the world
83.757	is going to get a better place
86.836	may seem a little fanciful.
89.17	Watch the news every day and the world
89.17	seems to be going backwards, not forwards.
93.599	And let's be frank:
95.321	it's pretty easy to be skeptical
95.321	about grand announcements
98.599	coming out of the UN.
101.067	But please, I invite you to suspend
101.067	your disbelief for just a moment.
105.956	Because back in 2001,
107.877	the UN agreed another set of goals,
107.877	the Millennium Development Goals.
113.138	And the flagship target there
113.138	was to halve the proportion of people
117.362	living in poverty by 2015.
121.072	The target was to take
121.072	from a baseline of 1990,
124.913	when 36 percent of the world's
124.913	population lived in poverty,
128.599	to get to 18 percent poverty this year.
132.599	Did we hit this target?
134.599	Well, no, we didn't.
136.599	We exceeded it.
138.677	This year, global poverty
138.677	is going to fall to 12 percent.
143.804	Now, that's still not good enough,
145.599	and the world does still have
145.599	plenty of problems.
149.242	But the pessimists and doomsayers
149.242	who say that the world can't get better
154.701	are simply wrong.
157.748	So how did we achieve this success?
160.002	Well, a lot of it was because
160.002	of economic growth.
163.383	Some of the biggest reductions in poverty
163.383	were in countries such as China and India,
168.599	which have seen rapid
168.599	economic growth in recent years.
172.898	So can we pull off the same trick again?
175.934	Can economic growth
175.934	get us to the Global Goals?
180.642	Well, to answer that question,
182.405	we need to benchmark where the world
182.405	is today against the Global Goals
186.599	and figure out how far we have to travel.
190.046	But that ain't easy,
191.973	because the Global Goals
191.973	aren't just ambitious,
194.814	they're also pretty complicated.
197.599	Over 17 goals, there are then 169 targets
201.767	and literally hundreds of indicators.
205.444	Also, while some of the goals
205.444	are pretty specific --
209.072	end hunger --
210.519	others are a lot vaguer --
212.439	promote peaceful and tolerant societies.
215.924	So to help us with this benchmarking,
217.873	I'm going to use a tool
217.873	called the Social Progress Index.
222.166	What this does is measures all the stuff
222.166	the Global Goals are trying to achieve,
226.144	but sums it up into a single number
226.144	that we can use as our benchmark
230.33	and track progress over time.
232.9	The Social Progress Index basically asks
232.9	three fundamental questions
236.477	about a society.
238.214	First of all, does everyone have
238.214	the basic needs of survival:
241.703	food, water, shelter, safety?
244.535	Secondly, does everyone have
244.535	the building blocks of a better life:
248.313	education, information, health
248.313	and a sustainable environment?
253.153	And does everyone have
253.153	the opportunity to improve their lives,
256.863	through rights, freedom of choice,
256.863	freedom from discrimination,
260.887	and access to the world's
260.887	most advanced knowledge?
264.463	The Social Progress Index sums all this
264.463	together using 52 indicators
268.599	to create an aggregate score
268.599	on a scale of 0 to 100.
273.436	And what we find is that there's
273.436	a wide diversity of performance
276.623	in the world today.
278.189	The highest performing country,
278.189	Norway, scores 88.
282.281	The lowest performing country,
282.281	Central African Republic, scores 31.
287.599	And we can add up
287.599	all the countries together,
289.719	weighting for the different
289.719	population sizes,
292.177	and that global score is 61.
296.16	In concrete terms,
297.335	that means that the average human being
297.335	is living on a level of social progress
301.117	about the same of Cuba
301.117	or Kazakhstan today.
305.229	That's where we are today: 61 out of 100.
308.42	What do we have to get to
308.42	to achieve the Global Goals?
312.254	Now, the Global Goals
312.254	are certainly ambitious,
314.766	but they're not about turning the world
314.766	into Norway in just 15 years.
319.395	So having looked at the numbers,
319.395	my estimate is that a score of 75
323.518	would not only be a giant leap forward
323.518	in human well-being,
327.599	it would also count as hitting
327.599	the Global Goals target.
331.412	So there's our target, 75 out of 100.
334.222	Can we get there?
336.275	Well, the Social Progress Index
336.275	can help us calculate this,
339.283	because as you might have noticed,
340.973	there are no economic indicators in there;
343.222	there's no GDP or economic growth
343.222	in the Social Progress Index model.
348.032	And what that lets us do
348.032	is understand the relationship
351.599	between economic growth
351.599	and social progress.
355.749	Let me show you on this chart.
357.393	So here on the vertical axis,
357.393	I've put social progress,
360.599	the stuff the Global Goals
360.599	are trying to achieve.
363.191	Higher is better.
364.761	And then on the horizontal axis,
364.761	is GDP per capita.
368.169	Further to the right means richer.
370.732	And in there, I'm now going to put
370.732	all the countries of the world,
374.056	each one represented by a dot,
376.188	and on top of that I'm going to put
376.188	the regression line
378.807	that shows the average relationship.
381.161	And what this tells us
381.161	is that as we get richer,
384.715	social progress does tend to improve.
388.072	However, as we get richer,
388.072	each extra dollar of GDP
392.687	is buying us less and less
392.687	social progress.
397.109	And now we can use this information
397.109	to start building our forecast.
401.403	So here is the world in 2015.
404.718	We have a social progress score of 61
408.14	and a GDP per capita of $14,000.
411.895	And the place we're trying to get to,
411.895	remember, is 75, that Global Goals target.
416.147	So here we are today,
416.147	$14,000 per capita GDP.
420.29	How rich are we going to be in 2030?
422.679	That's what we need to know next.
424.541	Well, the best forecast we can find comes
424.541	from the US Department of Agriculture,
428.816	which forecasts 3.1 percent
428.816	average global economic growth
433.491	over the next 15 years,
435.259	which means that in 2030,
435.259	if they're right,
438.402	per capita GDP will be about $23,000.
443.293	So now the question is:
443.293	if we get that much richer,
445.858	how much social progress
445.858	are we going to get?
448.747	Well, we asked a team
448.747	of economists at Deloitte
451.381	who checked and crunched the numbers,
453.174	and they came back and said, well, look:
453.174	if the world's average wealth goes
458.15	from $14,000 a year to $23,000 a year,
461.95	social progress is going to increase
464.262	from 61 to 62.4.
468.926	(Laughter)
470.863	Just 62.4. Just a tiny increase.
476.315	Now this seems a bit strange.
477.886	Economic growth seems
477.886	to have really helped
480.122	in the fight against poverty,
481.835	but it doesn't seem
481.835	to be having much impact
484.059	on trying to get to the Global Goals.
486.467	So what's going on?
488.182	Well, I think there are two things.
489.897	The first is that in a way,
489.897	we're the victims of our own success.
493.788	We've used up the easy wins
493.788	from economic growth,
496.804	and now we're moving on
496.804	to harder problems.
499.65	And also, we know that economic growth
499.65	comes with costs as well as benefits.
504.062	There are costs to the environment, costs
504.062	from new health problems like obesity.
509.825	So that's the bad news.
511.531	We're not going to get to the Global Goals
511.531	just by getting richer.
516.211	So are the pessimists right?
518.599	Well, maybe not.
519.965	Because the Social Progress Index
519.965	also has some very good news.
524.683	Let me take you back
524.683	to that regression line.
527.066	So this is the average relationship
527.066	between GDP and social progress,
530.47	and this is what our
530.47	last forecast was based on.
534.04	But as you saw already,
535.737	there is actually lots of noise
535.737	around this trend line.
540.471	What that tells us, quite simply,
542.932	is that GDP is not destiny.
546.589	We have countries that are underperforming
549.091	on social progress,
549.091	relative to their wealth.
552.321	Russia has lots
552.321	of natural resource wealth,
554.695	but lots of social problems.
556.871	China has boomed economically,
559.126	but hasn't made much headway
559.126	on human rights or environmental issues.
563.93	India has a space program
563.93	and millions of people without toilets.
569.264	Now, on the other hand, we have countries
569.264	that are overperforming
572.585	on social progress relative to their GDP.
575.922	Costa Rica has prioritized education,
575.922	health and environmental sustainability,
581.657	and as a result, it's achieving
581.657	a very high level of social progress,
585.602	despite only having a rather modest GDP.
589.471	And Costa Rica's not alone.
591.599	From poor countries like Rwanda
591.599	to richer countries like New Zealand,
595.599	we see that it's possible to get
595.599	lots of social progress,
599.221	even if your GDP is not so great.
602.649	And that's really important,
602.649	because it tells us two things.
606.284	First of all, it tells us that we already
606.284	in the world have the solutions
611.516	to many of the problems
611.516	that the Global Goals are trying to solve.
615.879	It also tells us
615.879	that we're not slaves to GDP.
620.029	Our choices matter: if we prioritize
620.029	the well-being of people,
624.328	then we can make a lot more progress
624.328	than our GDP might expect.
629.008	How much? Enough to get us
629.008	to the Global Goals?
632.184	Well, let's look at some numbers.
633.819	What we know already: the world today
633.819	is scoring 61 on social progress,
637.704	and the place we want to get to is 75.
640.526	If we rely on economic growth alone,
642.77	we're going to get to 62.4.
645.375	So let's assume now that we can get
645.375	the countries that are currently
649.501	underperforming on social progress --
649.501	the Russia, China, Indias --
652.719	just up to the average.
654.408	How much social progress does that get us?
656.623	Well, that takes us to 65.
659.297	It's a bit better, but still
659.297	quite a long way to go.
662.227	So let's get a little bit more
662.227	optimistic and say,
664.612	what if every country
664.612	gets a little bit better
667.426	at turning its wealth into well-being?
670.194	Well then, we get to 67.
673.44	And now let's be even bolder still.
676.119	What if every country in the world
676.119	chose to be like Costa Rica
680.599	in prioritizing human well-being,
682.993	using its wealth for the well-being
682.993	of its citizens?
685.599	Well then, we get to nearly 73,
685.599	very close to the Global Goals.
690.599	Can we achieve the Global Goals?
692.599	Certainly not with business as usual.
695.278	Even a flood tide of economic growth
695.278	is not going to get us there,
699.653	if it just raises the mega-yachts
699.653	and the super-wealthy
702.74	and leaves the rest behind.
705.177	If we're going to achieve the Global Goals
705.177	we have to do things differently.
709.195	We have to prioritize social progress,
709.195	and really scale solutions
713.428	around the world.
714.942	I believe the Global Goals
714.942	are a historic opportunity,
718.681	because the world's leaders
718.681	have promised to deliver them.
723.101	Let's not dismiss the goals
723.101	or slide into pessimism;
727.098	let's hold them to that promise.
729.829	And we need to hold them to that promise
729.829	by holding them accountable,
733.183	tracking their progress all the way
733.183	through the next 15 years.
736.928	And I want to finish by showing you
738.634	a way to do that, called
738.634	the People's Report Card.
741.423	The People's Report Card brings together
741.423	all this data into a simple framework
746.354	that we'll all be familiar
746.354	with from our school days,
748.918	to hold them to account.
750.37	It grades our performance
750.37	on the Global Goals
752.649	on a scale from F to A,
756.144	where F is humanity at its worst,
756.144	and A is humanity at its best.
761.69	Our world today is scoring a C-.
767.405	The Global Goals are all about
767.405	getting to an A,
770.858	and that's why we're going to be updating
770.858	the People's Report Card annually,
774.599	for the world and for all
774.599	the countries of the world,
777.836	so we can hold our leaders to account
780.451	to achieve this target
780.451	and fulfill this promise.
785.18	Because getting to the Global Goals will
785.18	only happen if we do things differently,
789.851	if our leaders do things differently,
792.042	and for that to happen,
792.042	that needs us to demand it.
796.494	So let's reject business as usual.
800.455	Let's demand a different path.
803.365	Let's choose the world that we want.
808.157	Thank you.
809.333	(Applause)
814.599	Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Michael.
818.675	Michael, just one question:
818.675	the Millennium Development Goals
821.522	established 15 years ago,
823.027	they were kind of applying
823.027	to every country
826.128	but it turned out to be really
826.128	a scorecard for emerging countries.
829.719	Now the new Global Goals
829.719	are explicitly universal.
832.195	They ask for every country to show action
832.195	and to show progress.
836.371	How can I, as a private citizen,
836.371	use the report card
839.383	to create pressure for action?
842.241	Michael Green: This is a really important
842.241	point; it's a big shift in priorities --
846.14	it's no longer about poor
846.14	countries and just poverty.
848.643	It's about every country.
849.882	And every country is going to have
849.882	challenges in getting to the Global Goals.
853.536	Even, I'm sorry to say, Bruno,
853.536	Switzerland has got to work to do.
856.87	And so that's why we're going to produce
856.87	these report cards in 2016
860.264	for every country in the world.
861.774	Then we can really see, how are we doing?
863.877	And it's not going to be rich countries
863.877	scoring straight A's.
866.782	And that, then, I think,
866.782	is to provide a point of focus
869.414	for people to start demanding action
869.414	and start demanding progress.
872.894	BG: Thank you very much.
874.366	(Applause)
