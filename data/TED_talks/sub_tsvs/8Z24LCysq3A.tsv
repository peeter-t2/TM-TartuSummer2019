15.946	This is the skyline
15.946	of my hometown, New Orleans.
21.026	It was a great place to grow up,
23.663	but it's one of the most vulnerable
23.663	spots in the world.
27.398	Half the city is already below sea level.
30.105	In 2005, the world watched as New Orleans
33.557	and the Gulf Coast were
33.557	devastated by Hurricane Katrina.
37.06	One thousand, eight hundred and thirty-six
37.06	people died. Nearly 300,000 homes were lost.
43.27	These are my mother's, at the top --
45.541	although that's not her car,
46.995	it was carried there
46.995	by floodwaters up to the roof --
49.543	and that's my sister's, below.
51.641	Fortunately, they and other
51.641	family members got out in time,
55.493	but they lost their homes,
55.493	and as you can see,
57.708	just about everything in them.
60.558	Other parts of the world
60.558	have been hit by storms
62.868	in even more devastating ways.
64.852	In 2008, Cyclone Nargis and its aftermath
67.73	killed 138,000 in Myanmar.
71.072	Climate change is affecting
71.072	our homes, our communities,
74.504	our way of life. We should be preparing
76.952	at every scale and at every opportunity.
80.609	This talk is about being
80.609	prepared for, and resilient to
84.464	the changes that are coming
84.464	and that will affect our homes
87.25	and our collective home, the Earth.
89.804	The changes in these times
89.804	won't affect us all equally.
94.156	There are important
94.156	distributional consequences,
96.466	and they're not what you
96.466	always might think.
98.634	In New Orleans, the elderly
98.634	and female-headed households
101.876	were among the most vulnerable.
104.156	For those in vulnerable,
104.156	low-lying nations,
106.244	how do you put a dollar value
106.244	on losing your country
109.092	where you ancestors are buried?
109.092	And where will your people go?
113.612	And how will they cope in a foreign land?
115.743	Will there be tensions over immigration,
117.82	or conflicts over competition
117.82	for limited resources?
121.316	It's already fueled conflicts
121.316	in Chad and Darfur.
126.308	Like it or not, ready
126.308	or not, this is our future.
131.125	Sure, some are looking
131.125	for opportunities in this new world.
134.652	That's the Russians planting
134.652	a flag on the ocean bottom
137.676	to stake a claim for minerals
137.676	under the receding Arctic sea ice.
141.108	But while there might be
141.108	some short-term individual winners,
144.37	our collective losses
144.37	will far outweigh them.
147.908	Look no further than the insurance
147.908	industry as they struggle
150.171	to cope with mounting catastrophic losses
152.227	from extreme weather events.
154.653	The military gets it.
154.653	They call climate change
157.508	a threat multiplier that could
157.508	harm stability and security,
160.749	while governments
160.749	around the world are evaluating
163.638	how to respond.
165.685	So what can we do? How can
165.685	we prepare and adapt?
169.86	I'd like to share three sets
169.86	of examples, starting with
172.891	adapting to violent storms and floods.
175.86	In New Orleans, the I-10 Twin Spans,
178.548	with sections knocked
178.548	out in Katrina, have been rebuilt
	for greater storm surge.
185.396	And these raised
185.396	and energy-efficient homes
187.942	were developed by Brad
187.942	Pitt and Make It Right
190.804	for the hard-hit Ninth Ward.
193.62	The devastated church
193.62	my mom attends has been
196.716	not only rebuilt higher,
196.716	it's poised to become
199.388	the first Energy Star
199.388	church in the country.
202.02	They're selling electricity
202.02	back to the grid
204.14	thanks to solar panels,
204.14	reflective paint and more.
207.787	Their March electricity
207.787	bill was only 48 dollars.
210.364	Now these are examples of New
210.364	Orleans rebuilding in this way,
214.677	but better if others act proactively
214.677	with these changes in mind.
219.573	For example, in Galveston,
219.573	here's a resilient home
223.356	that survived Hurricane Ike,
225.804	when others on neighboring
225.804	lots clearly did not.
228.42	And around the world,
228.42	satellites and warning systems
231.597	are saving lives in flood-prone
231.597	areas such as Bangladesh.
236.005	But as important as technology
236.005	and infrastructure are,
239.117	perhaps the human element
239.117	is even more critical.
242.853	We need better planning
242.853	and systems for evacuation.
246.236	We need to better understand
246.236	how people make decisions
249.325	in times of crisis, and why.
251.421	While it's true that many who died in Katrina
251.421	did not have access to transportation,
255.533	others who did refused to leave
255.533	as the storm approached,
258.733	often because available
258.733	transportation and shelters
262.555	refused to allow them to take their pets.
265.069	Imagine leaving behind your own pet
265.069	in an evacuation or a rescue.
270.089	Fortunately in 2006, Congress passed
272.964	the Pet Evacuation and Transportation
272.964	Standards Act (Laughter)
276.438	"— it spells ""PETS"" — to change that."
280.976	Second, preparing for heat and drought.
283.861	Farmers are facing challenges
283.861	of drought from Asia
286.734	to Africa, from Australia to Oklahoma,
289.238	while heat waves linked
289.238	with climate change
291.605	have killed tens of thousands of people
294.006	in Western Europe in 2003,
294.006	and again in Russia in 2010.
300.238	In Ethiopia, 70 percent, that's 7-0
300.238	percent of the population,
305.189	depends on rainfall for its livelihood.
307.798	Oxfam and Swiss Re, together
307.798	with Rockefeller Foundation,
311.51	are helping farmers like this
311.51	one build hillside terraces
315.166	and find other ways to conserve water,
317.797	but they're also providing for insurance
317.797	when the droughts do come.
321.798	The stability this provides
321.798	is giving the farmers
324.156	the confidence to invest.
325.982	It's giving them access
325.982	to affordable credit.
328.624	It's allowing them to become
328.624	more productive so that
330.272	they can afford their own insurance
330.272	over time, without assistance.
334.182	It's a virtuous cycle,
334.182	and one that could be replicated
336.826	throughout the developing world.
339.177	After a lethal 1995 heat wave
342.022	turned refrigerator
342.022	trucks from the popular
344.622	Taste of Chicago festival
344.622	into makeshift morgues,
347.815	Chicago became a recognized leader,
350.062	tamping down on the urban
350.062	heat island impact
352.893	through opening cooling centers,
354.91	outreach to vulnerable
354.91	neighborhoods, planting trees,
358.119	creating cool white
358.119	or vegetated green roofs.
361.046	This is City Hall's green roof, next to Cook
361.046	County's [portion of the] roof,
364.69	which is 77 degrees Fahrenheit
364.69	hotter at the surface.
368.206	Washington, D.C., last year,
368.206	actually led the nation
372.302	in new green roofs installed,
372.302	and they're funding this in part
375.614	thanks to a five-cent tax on plastic bags.
379.068	They're splitting the cost
379.068	of installing these green roofs
381.854	with home and building owners.
383.566	The roofs not only temper
383.566	urban heat island impact
386.097	but they save energy, and therefore money,
388.454	the emissions that cause climate change,
390.607	and they also reduce stormwater runoff.
393.102	So some solutions to heat can
393.102	provide for win-win-wins.
397.854	Third, adapting to rising seas.
401.616	Sea level rise threatens coastal
401.616	ecosystems, agriculture,
405.262	even major cities. This
405.262	is what one to two meters
408.646	of sea level rise looks
408.646	like in the Mekong Delta.
411.646	That's where half
411.646	of Vietnam's rice is grown.
414.297	Infrastructure is going to be affected.
417.43	Airports around the world
417.43	are located on the coast.
419.95	It makes sense, right? There's open space,
421.974	the planes can take off and land
421.974	without worrying about
424.619	creating noise or avoiding tall buildings.
426.834	Here's just one example,
426.834	San Francisco Airport,
429.97	with 16 inches or more of flooding.
432.684	Imagine the staggering cost of protecting
435.586	this vital infrastructure with levees.
438.94	But there might be some changes in store
440.869	that you might not imagine. For example,
443.076	planes require more runway for takeoff
445.637	because the heated, less dense
445.637	air, provides for less lift.
449.503	San Francisco is also
449.503	spending 40 million dollars
452.988	to rethink and redesign its
452.988	water and sewage treatment,
456.178	as water outfall pipes like this
456.178	one can be flooded with seawater,
459.508	causing backups at the plant,
459.508	harming the bacteria
462.477	that are needed to treat the waste.
464.168	So these outfall pipes
464.168	have been retrofitted
466.288	to shut seawater
466.288	off from entering the system.
469.444	Beyond these technical solutions, our work
472.372	at the Georgetown Climate
472.372	Center with communities
474.14	encourages them to look at what existing
474.14	legal and policy tools are available
477.908	and to consider how they can
477.908	accommodate change.
481.484	For example, in land use,
481.484	which areas do you want
484.436	to protect, through adding
484.436	a seawall, for example,
487.396	alter, by raising
487.396	buildings, or retreat from,
491.172	to allow the migration
491.172	of important natural systems,
493.98	such as wetlands or beaches?
496.707	Other examples to consider. In the U.K.,
498.964	the Thames Barrier protects
498.964	London from storm surge.
502.418	The Asian Cities Climate
502.418	[Change] Resilience Network
504.964	is restoring vital ecosystems
504.964	like forest mangroves.
508.162	These are not only important
508.162	ecosystems in their own right,
511.252	but they also serve as a buffer
511.252	to protect inland communities.
515.548	New York City is incredibly
515.548	vulnerable to storms,
519.26	as you can see from this clever
519.26	sign, and to sea level rise,
522.943	and to storm surge, as you can
522.943	see from the subway flooding.
526.103	But back above ground, these
526.103	raised ventilation grates
529.513	for the subway system show
529.513	that solutions can be both
532.061	functional and attractive.
532.061	In fact, in New York,
534.727	San Francisco and London,
534.727	designers have envisioned
537.879	ways to better integrate
537.879	the natural and built environments
540.767	with climate change in mind.
543.175	I think these are inspiring
543.175	examples of what's possible
546.079	when we feel empowered to plan
546.079	for a world that will be different.
549.246	But now, a word of caution.
552.264	Adaptation's too important
552.264	to be left to the experts.
555.143	Why? Well, there are no experts.
558.495	We're entering uncharted
558.495	territory, and yet
561.815	our expertise and our systems
561.815	are based on the past.
565.711	"""Stationarity"" is the notion"
565.711	that we can anticipate the future
568.688	based on the past, and plan accordingly,
571.559	and this principle governs
571.559	much of our engineering,
574.012	our design of critical
574.012	infrastructure, city water systems,
577.061	building codes, even water rights
577.061	and other legal precedents.
581.182	But we can simply no longer
581.182	rely on established norms.
584.311	We're operating outside the bounds
584.311	of CO2 concentrations
588.671	that the planet has seen
588.671	for hundreds of thousands of years.
593.178	The larger point I'm
593.178	trying to make is this.
596.491	It's up to us to look
596.491	at our homes and our communities,
600.187	our vulnerabilities
600.187	and our exposures to risk,
602.874	and to find ways to not just
602.874	survive, but to thrive,
606.419	and it's up to us to plan and to prepare
609.163	and to call on our government
609.163	leaders and require them
611.759	to do the same, even while they address
613.819	the underlying causes of climate change.
617.058	There are no quick fixes.
618.714	There are no one-size-fits-all solutions.
621.989	We're all learning by doing.
623.898	But the operative word is doing.
628.003	Thank you.
629.306	(Applause)
