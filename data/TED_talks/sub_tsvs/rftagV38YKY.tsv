12.879	As an archaeologist,
14.386	I'm most often asked
14.386	what my favorite discovery is.
18.421	The answer's easy:
20.649	my husband, Greg.
22.207	(Laughter)
23.602	We met in Egypt on my first dig.
25.969	It was my first lesson in finding
25.969	unexpected, wonderful things.
31.761	This began an incredible
31.761	archaeological partnership.
36.262	Years later, I proposed to him
36.262	in front of our favorite pair statue
41.429	of the Prince and Princess
41.429	Rahotep and Nofret,
44.614	in the Cairo Museum,
45.879	dating to 4,600 years ago.
48.435	I thought if I was going to ask Greg
48.435	to spend the rest of this life with me,
53.483	then I should ask him
53.483	in front of two people
56.284	who had pledged
56.284	to be together for eternity.
61.002	These symbols endure
61.002	because when we look at them,
63.902	we're looking at mirrors.
65.78	They are powerful reminders
67.822	that our common humanity has not changed.
71.627	The thrill of archaeological discovery
71.627	is as powerful as love,
77.031	because ancient history is the most
77.031	seductive mistress imaginable.
82.936	Many archaeologists
82.936	have devoted their lives
85.263	to unraveling the mysteries of the past
87.716	under hot suns
90.405	and Arctic winds
92.37	and in dense rainforests.
95.338	Many seek.
96.84	Some discover.
98.015	All worship at the temple of possibility
100.857	that one discovery might change history.
105.44	On my first day in Egypt,
105.44	I worked at a site
107.969	in the Northeast Egyptian Delta
107.969	called Mendes, dating to 4,200 years ago,
113.633	in a cemetery.
114.808	That's a picture of me --
116.032	I'm just in my bliss.
117.708	On the dig, surrounded
117.708	by emerald green rice paddies,
121.745	I discovered an intact pot.
125.592	Flipping it over,
127.242	I discovered a human thumbprint
127.242	left by whoever made the vessel.
132.554	For a moment, time stood still.
135.888	I didn't know where I was.
137.775	It was because at that moment I realized,
140.756	when we dig,
142.158	we're digging for people,
143.839	not things.
146.484	Never are we so present as when
146.484	we are in the midst of the great past.
152.333	I can't tell you how many times I've stood
152.333	in front of the Pyramids of Giza,
157.175	and they leave me speechless.
159.464	I feel like the luckiest
159.464	person in the world.
163.795	They're a monument to our human brilliance
163.795	and everything that is possible.
169.677	Many cannot process
169.677	their brilliance as human --
172.67	they think aliens built them.
175.07	But this is ridiculous.
177.072	All you need to do
177.072	is get up close and personal,
180.42	and see the hidden hand of man
182.916	in the chisel marks left
182.916	by the tools that built them.
188.024	The Great Pyramid of Giza
188.024	was built one stone at a time
191.8	with 2.3 million blocks,
194.992	with incredible bureaucratic efficiency.
199.124	It is not the pyramids
199.124	that stand the test of time;
202.113	it is human ingenuity.
204.376	That is our shared human brilliance.
209.343	History may be cyclical,
212.577	but we are singular.
215.588	I love what I do,
217.188	because I learn that we haven't changed.
221.306	I get to read about mother-in-law
221.306	jokes from Mesopotamia
225.514	from 3,500 years ago.
227.09	(Laughter)
229.795	I get to hear about neighbors
229.795	cursing each other
233.223	from 4,600 years ago in Egypt.
235.745	And my absolute favorite,
235.745	from 3,300 years ago in Luxor:
240.372	an inscription that describes schoolboys
240.372	who cut class to go drinking.
245.904	(Laughter)
247.898	Kids these days.
249.89	(Laughter)
251.702	I get to see the most
251.702	incredible architecture,
255.864	see stunning sculptures --
258.018	I mean, this is basically
258.018	a selfie in stone --
260.885	and see that we've always
260.885	rocked serious bling.
265.037	And also, we've been posting on walls
268.031	and obsessing about cats --
270.134	(Laughter)
271.165	for thousands of years.
272.702	(Laughter)
273.733	(Applause)
278.606	Archaeologists are the cultural
278.606	memory preservers
281.98	and the spokespeople
283.645	for the billions of people
283.645	and the thousands of cultures
287.001	that came before us.
288.956	Good science, imagination
288.956	and a leap of faith
292.075	are the trifecta we use to raise the dead.
296.813	In the last year,
298.008	archaeologists have made
298.008	incredible discoveries, including:
302.014	new human ancestors from South Africa;
305.38	tools from 3.3 million years ago --
308.422	these are the oldest tools
308.422	ever discovered --
310.682	in Kenya.
312.054	And this, from a series
312.054	of medical implements found
315.722	from Blackbeard's ship from 1718.
318.965	What you're looking at is a medical tool
318.965	used to treat syphilis.
325.239	Ouch!
326.483	(Laughter)
327.867	For each of these,
329.235	there are thousands of other
329.235	incredibly important discoveries
332.702	made by my colleagues,
334.198	that do not make headlines.
336.544	However, I believe that the most
336.544	important thing we do as archaeologists
342.742	is acknowledge that past people existed
346.457	and lived lives worth learning about.
349.593	Can you even imagine
349.593	what the world would be like today
353.179	if we acknowledged all
353.179	human beings in this way?
358.54	So, on a dig, we have a challenge:
362.633	it often looks like this.
364.396	You can't see anything.
366.254	Where are we going to start digging?
368.027	This is from a site south of Cairo.
369.762	Let's have a look from space.
372.409	Again, you can't really see much.
374.371	What you're looking at
374.371	is a WorldView-3 satellite image,
378.182	which has a .3 meter resolution.
381.265	That's 10 inches.
382.667	This means that you can zoom in
382.667	from 400 miles in space
386.965	and see your tablets.
389.451	How do I know about this?
391.684	It's because I'm a space archaeologist.
396.026	Let me repeat that.
397.863	I am a space archaeologist.
400.656	This means --
401.832	(Applause)
403.102	Thank you.
404.776	This means I use satellite images
404.776	and process them using algorithms,
409.271	and look at subtle differences
409.271	in the light spectrum
411.931	that indicate buried things
411.931	under the ground
414.269	that I get to go excavate and survey.
417.317	By the way --
418.501	NASA has a Space Archaeology program,
421.102	so it's a real job.
422.612	(Laughter)
424.371	So, let's have a look again.
425.859	We're back at the site
425.859	just south of Cairo.
427.968	You can't see anything.
429.675	Keep your eye on the red rectangle.
433.077	When we process the image
433.077	using algorithms --
435.728	think like a space-based CAT scan --
439.271	this is what you see.
441.894	This rectilinear form is an ancient tomb
445.627	that is previously unknown
445.627	and unexcavated,
448.252	and you all are the first people
448.252	to see it in thousands of years.
453.662	(Applause)
459.143	I believe we have barely
459.143	scratched the surface
461.994	in terms of what's left to discover.
464.918	In the Egyptian Delta alone,
466.94	we've excavated less
466.94	than one-1000th of one percent
470.782	of the total volume of Egyptian sites.
474.136	When you add to that
474.136	the thousands of other sites
476.498	my team and I have discovered,
478.554	what we thought we knew
478.554	pales in comparison
482.333	to what we have left to discover.
484.938	When you look at the incredible work
486.765	that my colleagues are doing
486.765	all around the world
489.21	and what they're finding,
491.041	I believe that there are millions
491.041	of undiscovered archaeological sites
496.663	left to find.
498.394	Discovering them will do nothing less
501.033	than unlock the full potential
501.033	of our existence.
506.234	But we have a challenge.
509.143	Over the last year,
510.754	we've seen horrible headlines
513.402	of incredible destruction going on
513.402	to archaeological sites,
517.748	and massive looting by people like ISIL.
521.414	ISIL has destroyed temples at Palmyra.
525.06	Who blows up a temple?
527.257	They've destroyed the Tomb of Jonah.
530.02	And we've seen looting
530.02	at sites so rampant,
534.855	it looks like craters of the moon.
539	Knowing ISIL's desire to destroy
539	modern human lives,
543.304	it's a natural extension for them
543.304	to destroy cultural identity as well.
547.716	Countless invading armies
547.716	have done the same throughout history.
551.638	We know that ISIL is profiting
551.638	from the looting of sites,
555.521	but we don't know the scale.
557.834	This means that any object
557.834	purchased on the market today
561.779	from the Middle East
562.959	could potentially be funding terrorism.
566.562	When a site is looted,
568.433	it's as if a puzzle already missing
574.237	has had the rest obscured
574.237	beyond recognition.
577.498	This is ancient identity theft writ large.
580.554	We know that there are two kinds
580.554	of looting going on:
583.07	looting by criminal elements like ISIL,
585.78	and then more local looting
585.78	by those that are desperate for money.
590.069	We would all do the same
590.069	to feed our families;
593.335	I don't blame the local looters.
595.508	I blame the middlemen,
595.508	the unethical traffickers
600.21	and an international art market
602.218	that exploits often ambiguous
602.218	or even completely nonexistent laws.
608.758	We know looting is going on
608.758	on a global scale and it's increasing,
613.165	but presently we don't have
613.165	any tools to stop it.
616.942	This is beginning to change.
619.122	My team and I have just completed a study
619.122	looking at looting in Egypt.
623.584	We looked at open-source data
625.955	and mapped the entirety
625.955	of looting across Egypt
628.914	from 2002 to 2013.
632.294	We found evidence of looting
632.294	and site destruction at 267 sites,
636.874	and mapped over 200,000 looting pits.
641.721	It's astonishing.
642.918	And putting that data together --
644.615	you can see the looting pits marked here.
648.262	At one site, the looting got bad
648.262	from 2009, 2011, 2012 --
653.577	hundreds and hundreds of pits.
655.604	Putting all the data together,
657.059	what we found is that,
657.059	contrary to popular opinion,
660.134	looting did not start to get worse
660.134	in Egypt in 2011 after the Arab Spring,
665.219	but in 2009, after the global recession.
669.351	Thus, we've shown with big data
672.004	that looting is fundamentally
672.004	an economic issue.
676.793	If we do nothing to stop the problem,
679.993	all of Egypt's sites will be affected
679.993	by looting by 2040.
684.504	Thus, we are at a tipping point.
687.7	We are the generation with all the tools
687.7	and all the technologies
690.847	to stop looting,
692.081	but we're not working fast enough.
697.788	Sometimes an archaeological site
697.788	can surprise you with its resilience.
703.233	I am just back from the field,
705.613	where I co-led a joint mission
705.613	with Egypt's Ministry of Antiquities
709.216	at a site called Lisht.
711.052	This site dates to the Middle Kingdom
711.052	of Egypt between 2,000 and 1,750 BC.
716.314	The Middle Kingdom was Ancient
716.314	Egypt's Renaissance period.
719.093	After a time of intense internal strife
719.093	and environmental challenges,
723.021	Egypt rebounded
724.299	with an incredible resurgence
724.299	of art, architecture and literature.
729.28	It's a favorite period of time
729.28	to study in Egypt,
731.702	because it teaches us so much
731.702	about how we can survive and thrive
735.932	after great disasters.
737.611	Now at this site, we had already mapped
737.611	countless looting pits.
742.3	Lisht is a royal site;
743.487	there would have been thousands
743.487	of people buried there
746.185	who lived and worked
746.185	at the court of Pharaoh.
748.323	You can see this before and after;
748.323	you see dozens of looting pits.
751.515	North Lisht.
752.711	This is in South Lisht, before and after.
756.787	When we first visited the site,
758.316	we could see the tombs
758.316	of many high-ranking officials
760.944	that had been looted.
762.85	Let me put into perspective
762.85	for you what was taken.
765.71	Imagine a two meter by two meter area
765.71	full of coffins, jewelry
771.019	and incredible statuary.
773.055	Multiply that times over a thousand.
777.122	That's what was taken.
779.51	So, when we started work,
780.752	my Egyptian co-director, Mohamed Youssef,
780.752	approached me and said,
783.928	"""We must work at this one particular tomb."
786.763	It's been attacked by looters.
788.546	"If we don't do anything, they'll be back."""
790.586	Of course I agreed,
790.586	but I didn't think we'd find anything.
794.006	I thought the looters
794.006	had stolen everything.
796.152	What we started to find
796.152	were the most incredible reliefs.
799.173	Look at this painting --
799.173	it's just stunning.
801.363	We started finding engraved inscriptions.
804.042	And even the titles of the tomb owner --
806.137	he had titles like,
806.137	"""Overseer of the Army,"""
808.472	"""Overseer of the Treasury."""
809.923	I began to have hope.
811.521	Maybe, just maybe we would find his name.
815.148	For the ancient Egyptians, having
815.148	their name last for eternity
818.159	was their goal.
820.216	And then one day,
821.813	this appeared.
823.588	This is the name of the tomb owner: Intef.
828.022	You can see it written out
828.022	here, in hieroglyphs.
830.679	Working together with my Egyptian team,
833.459	we had restored someone's name
833.459	from 3,900 years ago.
837.762	(Applause)
845.584	Working together
845.584	with my Egyptian colleagues,
847.762	we celebrated this moment
847.762	of shared discovery.
850.064	What we were doing together
850.064	was right and true.
853.39	We found this incredible
853.39	false door, mostly intact.
855.893	On it we read about Intef
855.893	and his inscriptions.
859.041	You can actually even see him seated here.
863.092	What I realized is that everything
863.092	I had assumed about looted sites
867.709	had been proven wrong.
869.4	Every day on site we worked
869.4	together with 70 Egyptians
872.749	as colleagues and friends.
875.69	In the face of so much
875.69	hatred and ignorance
878.369	against those in the Middle East,
880.393	every moment on site felt like
880.393	a protest for peace.
885.146	When you work with those
885.146	that don't look like you,
887.521	or think like you, or speak like you,
889.637	your shared mission
889.637	of archaeological discovery
892.541	erases all superficial differences.
896.888	What I learned this season
898.452	is that archaeology
898.452	isn't about what you find.
901.629	It's about what you can prove possible.
905.193	Sometimes when you travel,
905.193	you end up finding long-lost family --
908.354	not those with whom you share genes,
910.885	but a shared entry in the book of life.
913.404	This is Omer Farrouk, my brother.
916.769	Omer's a Gufti from a village
916.769	just North of Luxor, called Guft.
921.401	Guftis are part of a celebrated
921.401	tradition in Egyptology.
924.046	They help with digging
924.046	and work crew organization.
927.319	Omer is my COO and CFO.
929.775	I simply couldn't do work without him.
932.966	One day many years ago,
932.966	when I was a young graduate student
936.388	and Omer was a young Gufti
936.388	who couldn't speak much English,
940.495	we learned, completely randomly,
942.495	that we were born in the same year,
945.809	the same month
947.434	and the same day, six hours apart.
952.438	Twins.
953.613	(Laughter)
955.856	Separated by an ocean,
955.856	but forever connected
958.178	for Ancient Egypt is our mother.
960.867	I knew then we'd always work together --
963.084	not in my brain,
965.337	but in the part of your soul that knows
965.337	not everything can be explained.
971.35	(Arabic) Omer by brother,
974.563	I will always love you.
978.167	(English) Omer my brother,
978.167	I will always love you.
983.072	So, just before my first dig in Egypt,
985.323	my mentor, the very famous Egyptologist
985.323	Professor William Kelly Simpson,
989.041	called me into his office.
990.869	He handed me a check for $2,000,
994.25	"and said, ""This is to cover your expenses."
996.948	Have a glorious adventure this summer.
999.548	Someday you will do this
999.548	"for someone else."""
1003.981	Thus, my TED Prize wish
1003.981	is partial payback, plus interest --
1008.116	(Laughter)
1009.394	for a great human being's
1009.394	generosity and kindness.
1015.591	So, my wish.
1017.655	I wish for us to discover the millions
1017.655	of unknown archaeological sites
1023.346	around the world.
1024.981	By creating a 21st-century army
1024.981	of global explorers,
1029.443	we'll find and protect
1029.443	the world's hidden heritage,
1032.487	which contains clues
1032.487	to humankind's collective resilience
1037.122	and creativity.
1039.284	(Applause)
1040.974	Thank you.
1042.188	(Applause)
1050.254	So how are we going to do this?
1052.899	We are going to build
1052.899	with the TED Prize money
1056.315	an online, crowdsource,
1056.315	citizen science platform
1060.397	to allow anyone in the world
1060.397	to engage with discovering
1064.707	archaeological sites.
1067.663	There are only a couple hundred of us
1067.663	space archaeologists around the world.
1071.313	It is my dream to engage the world
1074.008	with helping to find sites
1074.008	and protect them.
1077.492	What you'll do is sign in,
1077.492	create a username --
1080.647	note that this particular username
1080.647	is already taken.
1083.332	(Laughter)
1085.214	You'll take a tutorial
1085.214	and you'll start work.
1087.399	I want to note at the outset
1088.838	that in no way will be sharing
1088.838	GPS data or mapping data for sites.
1092.957	We want to treat them
1092.957	like human patient data,
1095.484	and not reveal their locations.
1097.817	You'll then be dealt a card from a deck --
1102.063	and you'll be looking for features.
1104.309	My team and I will have batch-processed
1106.303	large amounts of satellite data
1106.303	using algorithms
1108.83	in order for you to find things,
1110.397	so you'll be doing really good science.
1112.296	You'll then be starting to look.
1113.886	What do you see? Do you see a temple?
1115.832	Do you see a tomb? Do you see a pyramid?
1118.792	Do you see any potential
1118.792	site damage or site looting?
1122.348	You'll then begin to mark what's there.
1124.478	And off to the side are always
1124.478	going to be rich examples
1127.996	of exactly what you're seeing,
1127.996	to help guide you.
1130.965	All the data that you help us collect
1130.965	will be shared with vetted authorities,
1135.436	and will help create
1135.436	a new global alarm system
1138.656	to help protect sites.
1141.372	But it's not just going to stop there.
1144.488	All the archaeologists with whom
1144.488	we share your discoveries
1147.506	will take you with them
1147.506	as they begin to excavate them,
1151.26	by using Periscope, Google Plus
1151.26	and social media.
1157.218	A hundred years ago,
1157.218	archaeology was for the rich.
1161.289	Fifty years ago,
1163.024	it was for men.
1164.675	Now it's primarily for academics.
1167.679	Our goal is to democratize the process
1167.679	of archaeological discovery,
1172.354	and allow anyone to participate.
1175.89	Ninety-four years ago,
1177.907	Howard Carter discovered
1177.907	the tomb of King Tut.
1181.91	Who is the next Howard Carter?
1185.543	It might be you.
1189.918	By creating this platform,
1191.55	we will find the millions of places
1191.55	occupied by the billions of people
1196.299	that came before us.
1198.53	If we want to answer
1198.53	the big questions about who we are
1201.756	and where we've come from,
1203.041	the answers to those questions
1203.041	do not lie in pyramids or palaces,
1207.504	but in the cities and villages
1207.504	of those that came before us.
1212.381	If we want to learn about the past,
1214.996	it's time we inverted the pyramids.
1219.098	Acknowledging that the past
1219.098	is worth saving
1222.642	means so much more.
1225.532	It means that we're worth saving, too.
1230.206	And the greatest story ever told
1234.77	is the story of our shared human journey.
1239.352	But the only way we're going
1239.352	to be able to write it
1242.669	is if we do it together.
1247.09	Come with me.
1248.778	Thank you.
1249.954	(Applause)
