14.057	"Welcome to ""Five Dangerous Things"
14.057	"You Should Let Your Children Do."""
18.51	I don't have children.
20.51	I borrow my friends' children, so --
22.844	(Laughter)
26.082	take all this advice with a grain of salt.
29.855	I'm Gever Tulley.
31.703	I'm a contract computer
31.703	scientist by trade,
36.287	but I'm the founder of something
36.287	called the Tinkering School.
40.946	It's a summer program
40.946	which aims to help kids
43.857	learn how to build the things
43.857	that they think of.
46.459	So we build a lot of things,
48.372	and I do put power tools
48.372	into the hands of second-graders.
52.516	So if you're thinking about sending
52.516	your kid to Tinkering School,
55.594	they do come back bruised,
55.594	scraped and bloody.
59.002	(Laughter)
61.295	You know, we live in a world
62.891	that's subjected to ever more
62.891	stringent child safety regulations.
66.85	There doesn't seem to be
66.85	any limit on how crazy
72.941	child safety regulations can get.
75.31	We put suffocation warnings
75.31	on every piece of plastic film
79.51	manufactured in the United States,
81.168	or for sale with an item
81.168	in the United States.
83.771	We put warnings on coffee cups
86.502	to tell us that the contents may be hot.
89.253	And we seem to think that any item
89.253	sharper than a golf ball is too sharp
96.144	for children under the age of 10.
98.224	So where does this trend stop?
101.443	When we round every corner
101.443	and eliminate every sharp object,
106.261	every pokey bit in the world,
109.178	then the first time that kids
109.178	come in contact with anything sharp,
114.273	or not made out of round plastic,
117.586	they'll hurt themselves with it.
119.51	So, as the boundaries
119.51	of what we determine as the safety zone
125.838	grow ever smaller,
127.426	we cut off our children
127.426	from valuable opportunities
131.395	to learn how to interact
131.395	with the world around them.
134.51	And despite all of our best
134.51	efforts and intentions,
138.765	kids are always going to figure out
140.487	how to do the most dangerous
140.487	thing they can,
142.566	in whatever environment they can.
144.534	(Laughter)
145.95	So despite the provocative title,
149.322	this presentation is really about safety,
152.099	and about some simple things
152.099	that we can do
156.852	to raise our kids to be creative,
161.432	confident and in control
161.432	of the environment around them.
165.517	And what I now present to you
167.67	is an excerpt from a book in progress.
170.94	"The book is called ""50 Dangerous Things."""
173.267	"This is ""Five Dangerous Things."""
175.51	Thing number one: Play with fire.
178.668	Learning to control one of the most
178.668	elemental forces in nature
183.662	is a pivotal moment
183.662	in any child's personal history.
187.811	Whether we remember it or not,
189.786	it's the first time we really get control
193.262	of one of these mysterious things.
195.93	These mysteries are only revealed
197.775	to those who get the opportunity
197.775	to play with it.
200.18	So, playing with fire.
203.159	This is like one of the great things
203.159	we ever discovered, fire.
208.509	From playing with it, they learn
208.509	some basic principles about fire,
211.677	about intake, combustion, exhaust.
215.51	These are the three working
215.51	elements of fire
217.63	that you have to have
217.63	for a good, controlled fire.
220.827	And you can think of the open-pit
220.827	fire as a laboratory.
225.755	You don't know what they're going
225.755	to learn from playing with it.
228.794	Let them fool around with it
228.794	on their own terms and trust me,
233.241	they're going to learn things
235.067	that you can't get out of playing
235.067	with Dora the Explorer toys.
240.103	(Laughter)
241.825	Number two: Own a pocketknife.
244.881	Pocketknives are kind of drifting
244.881	out of our cultural consciousness,
249.121	which I think is a terrible thing.
251.908	(Laughter)
255.395	Your first pocketknife
255.395	is like the first universal tool
259.291	that you're given.
260.51	You know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar,
263.51	it's a screwdriver and it's a blade, yeah.
266.51	And it's a powerful and empowering tool.
271.122	And in a lot of cultures
271.122	they give knives --
273.95	like, as soon as they're
273.95	toddlers, they have knives.
276.505	These are Inuit children
276.505	cutting whale blubber.
280.103	I first saw this in a Canadian
280.103	Film Board film when I was 10,
284.095	and it left a lasting impression,
286.357	to see babies playing with knives.
288.51	And it shows that kids can develop
288.51	an extended sense of self
292.51	through a tool at a very young age.
295.101	You lay down a couple
295.101	of very simple rules --
297.51	always cut away from your body,
297.51	keep the blade sharp, never force it --
302.096	and these are things kids
302.096	can understand and practice with.
305.086	And yeah, they're going to cut themselves.
307.124	I have some terrible scars on my legs
307.124	from where I stabbed myself.
310.259	But you know, they're young.
310.259	They heal fast.
312.747	(Laughter)
316.08	Number three: Throw a spear.
318.954	It turns out that our brains
318.954	are actually wired for throwing things,
323.003	and like muscles, if you don't
323.003	use parts of your brain,
328.715	they tend to atrophy over time.
331.105	But when you exercise them,
334.334	any given muscle adds strength
334.334	to the whole system,
336.915	and that applies to your brain, too.
339.221	So practicing throwing things
339.221	has been shown to stimulate
344.42	the frontal and parietal lobes,
346.407	which have to do with
346.407	visual acuity, 3D understanding,
351.786	and structural problem solving,
355.357	so it helps develop their visualization
355.357	skills and their predictive ability.
361.111	And throwing is a combination
361.111	of analytical and physical skill,
366.51	so it's very good for that kind
366.51	of whole-body training.
372.209	These kinds of target-based practices
372.209	also help kids develop
378.449	attention and concentration skills,
381.095	so those are great.
382.758	Number [four]: Deconstruct appliances.
387.574	There is a world of interesting things
387.574	inside your dishwasher.
391.51	Next time you're about
391.51	to throw out an appliance,
395.438	don't throw it out.
396.619	Take it apart with your kid,
398.057	or send him to my school,
398.057	and we'll take it apart with them.
401.442	Even if you don't know what the parts are,
403.738	puzzling out what they might be for
406.326	is a really good practice for the kids
409.8	to get sort of the sense
409.8	that they can take things apart,
415.266	and no matter how complex they are,
417.479	they can understand parts of them.
419.623	And that means that eventually,
419.623	they can understand all of them.
422.722	It's a sense of knowability,
422.722	that something is knowable.
426.953	So these black boxes that we live with
426.953	and take for granted
430.709	are actually complex things
430.709	made by other people,
434.51	and you can understand them.
436.647	Number five: Two-parter.
440.62	Break the Digital
440.62	Millennium Copyright Act.
442.756	(Laughter)
445.066	There are laws beyond safety regulations
448.876	that attempt to limit
448.876	how we can interact with the things
451.615	that we own -- in this case,
451.615	digital media.
454.51	It's a very simple exercise:
456.669	Buy a song on iTunes, write it to a CD,
461.098	then rip the CD to an MP3,
461.098	and play it on your very same computer.
464.971	You've just broken a law.
466.804	Technically, the RIAA
466.804	could come and prosecute you.
470.323	It's an important lesson
470.323	for kids to understand,
472.915	that some of these laws
472.915	get broken by accident,
476.415	and that laws have to be interpreted.
479.185	That's something we often
479.185	talk about with the kids
481.559	when we're fooling around with things
481.559	and breaking them open,
485.675	and taking them apart
485.675	and using them for other things.
488.415	And also when we go out and drive a car.
494.265	Driving a car is a really empowering act
494.265	for a young child,
498.51	so this is the alternate --
500.51	(Laughter)
502.209	For those of you who aren't comfortable
502.209	actually breaking the law,
506.174	you can drive a car with your child.
509.871	This is a great stage for a kid.
513.601	This happens about the same time
515.177	that they get latched onto
515.177	things like dinosaurs,
517.53	these big things in the outside world,
519.655	that they're trying to get a grip on.
521.655	A car is a similar object,
521.655	and they can get in a car and drive it.
526.433	And that really gives them
526.433	a handle on a world
530.802	in a way that they don't often
530.802	have access to.
535.375	And it's perfectly legal.
537.029	Find a big empty lot,
537.029	make sure there's nothing in it,
539.703	and that it's on private property,
539.703	and let them drive your car.
543.51	It's very safe actually.
545.143	And it's fun for the whole family.
547.136	(Laughter)
551.494	Let's see, I think that's it.
551.494	That's number five and a half. OK.
