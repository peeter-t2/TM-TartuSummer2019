12.624	It is said that the grass is always greener
16.672	on the other side of the fence,
19.726	and I believe this is true,
22.872	especially when I hear President Obama
25.456	often talk about the Korean education system
27.954	as a benchmark of success.
31.465	Well, I can tell you that,
33.862	in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature
37.409	of the Korean school system,
39.6	also known as pressure cooker,
41.934	not everyone can do well in that environment.
47.593	While many people responded in different ways
50.218	about our education system,
53.218	my response to the high-pressure environment
56.594	was making bows with pieces of wood
59.524	found near my apartment building.
62.268	Why bows?
64.788	I'm not quite sure.
67.539	Perhaps, in the face of constant pressure,
71.484	my caveman instinct of survival
73.731	has connected with the bows.
78.053	If you think about it,
79.787	the bow has really helped drive human survival
83.2	since prehistoric times.
85.925	The area within three kilometers of my home
89.192	used to be a mulberry forest
91.375	during the Joseon dynasty,
93.665	where silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves.
98.122	In order to raise the historical awareness of this fact,
102.828	the government has planted mulberry trees.
107.163	The seeds from these trees
108.941	also have spread by birds here and there
111.74	nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway
115.218	that has been built around the 1988 Olympics.
119.584	The area near these walls,
122.085	which nobody bothers to pay attention to,
125.065	had been left free from major intervention,
128.259	and this is where I first found my treasures.
134.159	As I fell deeper into bow making,
137.36	I began to search far and beyond my neighborhood.
141.571	When I went on school field trips,
143.689	family vacations, or simply on my way home
146.928	from extracurricular classes,
149.763	I wandered around wooded areas
151.862	and gathered tree branches
153.601	with the tools that I sneaked inside my school bag.
157.572	And they would be somethings like saws, knives,
161.273	sickles and axes
163.519	that I covered up with a piece of towel.
168.207	I would bring the branches home,
170.088	riding buses and subways,
172.077	barely holding them in my hands.
175.466	And I did not bring the tools here to Long Beach.
179.342	Airport security.
180.898	(Laughter)
182.978	In the privacy of my room, covered in sawdust,
186.697	I would saw, trim and polish wood all night long
190.751	until a bow took shape.
193.218	One day, I was changing the shape of a bamboo piece
197.713	and ended up setting the place on fire.
202.468	Where? The rooftop of my apartment building,
207.257	a place where 96 families call home.
210.897	A customer from a department store across from my building
213.488	called 911,
214.978	and I ran downstairs to tell my mom
217.025	with half of my hair burned.
222.242	I want to take this opportunity
224.37	to tell my mom, in the audience today:
228.074	Mom, I was really sorry,
230.415	and I will be more careful with open fire from now on.
234.061	My mother had to do a lot of explaining,
236.695	telling people that her son did not commit
239.024	a premeditated arson.
245.25	I also researched extensively on bows around the world.
249.42	In that process, I tried to combine
251.466	the different bows from across time and places
253.907	to create the most effective bow.
257.69	I also worked with many different types of wood,
260.043	such as maple, yew and mulberry,
263.231	and did many shooting experiments
265.171	in the wooded area near the urban expressway
267.67	that I mentioned before.
270.505	The most effective bow for me
272.53	would be like this.
275.297	One: Curved tips can maximize the springiness
279.51	when you draw and shoot the arrow.
283.041	Two: Belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight,
287.938	which means more power.
291.599	Three: Sinew used in the outer layer of the limb
295.911	for maximum tension storage.
298.816	And four: Horn used to store energy in compression.
307.055	After fixing, breaking, redesigning,
310.053	mending, bending and amending,
312.984	my ideal bow began to take shape,
316.291	and when it was finally done,
320.146	it looked like this.
324.673	I was so proud of myself
326.91	for inventing a perfect bow on my own.
332.984	This is a picture of Korean traditional bows
336.416	taken from a museum,
338.312	and see how my bow resembles them.
343.796	Thanks to my ancestors
345.362	for robbing me of my invention. (Laughter)
351.542	Through bowmaking,
353.394	I came in contact with part of my heritage.
356.455	Learning the information that has accumulated over time
360.018	and reading the message left by my ancestors
362.856	were better than any consolation therapy
365.455	or piece of advice any living adults could give me.
370.404	You see, I searched far and wide,
373.322	but never bothered to look close and near.
376.798	From this realization,
379.043	I began to take interest in Korean history,
381.864	which had never inspired me before.
385.261	In the end, the grass is often greener
388.637	on my side of the fence,
390.427	although we don't realize it.
393.604	Now, I am going to show you how my bow works.
398.355	And let's see how this one works.
403.568	This is a bamboo bow,
405.705	with 45-pound draw weights.
409.637	(Noise of shooting arrow)
411.821	(Applause)
420.285	A bow may function in a simple mechanism,
424.694	but in order to make a good bow,
427.245	a great amount of sensitivity is required.
431.257	You need to console and communicate
433.787	with the wood material.
436.533	Each fiber in the wood
438.225	has its own reason and function for being,
441.051	and only through cooperation and harmony among them
444.446	comes a great bow.
448.043	I may be an [odd] student
449.833	with unconventional interests,
452.024	but I hope I am making a contribution
454.966	by sharing my story with all of you.
458.855	My ideal world is a place
461.108	where no one is left behind,
463.321	where everyone is needed exactly where they are,
466.614	like the fibers and the tendons in a bow,
470.21	a place where the strong is flexible
473.479	and the vulnerable is resilient.
477.272	The bow resembles me,
478.923	and I resemble the bow.
481.971	Now, I am shooting a part of myself to you.
486.835	No, better yet, a part of my mind
489.585	has just been shot over to your mind.
492.424	Did it strike you?
494.668	Thank you.
496.208	(Applause)
