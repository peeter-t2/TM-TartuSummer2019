15.731	The great texts of the ancient world
18.215	don't survive to us in their original form.
21.53	They survive because medieval scribes copied them
25.049	and copied them and copied them.
27.048	And so it is with Archimedes,
29.698	the great Greek mathematician.
31.464	Everything we know about Archimedes as a mathematician
34.466	we know about because of just three books,
37.164	and they're called A, B and C.
39.08	And A was lost by an Italian humanist in 1564.
43.913	And B was last heard of in the Pope's Library
46.716	about a hundred miles north of Rome in Viterbo in 1311.
52.548	Now Codex C was only discovered in 1906,
56.845	and it landed on my desk in Baltimore
59.394	on the 19th of January, 1999.
63.52	And this is Codex C here.
65.938	Now Codex C is actually buried in this book.
71.107	It's buried treasure.
72.557	Because this book is actually a prayer book.
74.892	It was finished by a guy called Johannes Myrones
77.856	on the 14th of April, 1229.
81.473	And to make his prayer book he used parchment.
83.958	But he didn't use new parchment,
86.373	he used parchment recycled from earlier manuscripts,
89.687	and there were seven of them.
91.424	And Archimedes Codex C was just one of those seven.
94.907	He took apart the Archimedes manuscript and the other seven manuscripts.
100.374	He erased all of their texts,
103.757	and then he cut the sheets down in the middle,
106.175	he shuffled them up,
108.419	and he rotated them 90 degrees,
110.337	and he wrote prayers on top of these books.
112.389	And essentially these seven manuscripts
114.086	disappeared for 700 years, and we have a prayer book.
118.434	The prayer book was discovered by this guy,
121.683	Johan Ludvig Heiberg, in 1906.
124.41	And with just a magnifying glass,
125.851	he transcribed as much of the text as he could.
128.735	And the thing is that he found two texts in this manuscript
131.917	that were unique texts.
133.685	They weren't in A and B at all;
135.285	they were completely new texts by Archimedes,
136.983	"and they were called ""The Method"" and ""The Stomachion."""
140.218	And it became a world famous manuscript.
142.487	Now it should be clear by now
144.302	that this book is in bad condition.
147.016	It got in worse condition in the 20th century
150.486	after Heiberg saw it.
152.218	Forgeries were painted over it,
153.735	and it suffered very badly from mold.
156.818	This book is the definition of a write-off.
160.568	It's the sort of book
162.302	that you thought would be in an institution.
164.967	But it's not in an institution,
167.153	it was bought by a private owner in 1998.
171.785	Why did he buy this book?
173.535	Because he wanted to make that which was fragile safe.
177.072	He wanted to make that which was unique ubiquitous.
180.318	He wanted to make that which was expensive free.
184.984	And he wanted to do this as a matter of principle.
188.119	Because not many people are really going to read Archimedes in ancient Greek,
192.651	but they should have the chance to do it.
195.335	So he gathered around himself the friends of Archimedes,
198.634	and he promised to pay for all the work.
200.77	And it was an expensive job,
202.468	but actually it wouldn't be as much as you think
205.938	because these people, they didn't come from money,
208.103	they came from Archimedes.
209.922	And they came from all sorts of different backgrounds.
211.638	They came from particle physics,
213.821	they came from classical philology,
215.387	they came from book conservation,
217.355	they came from ancient mathematics,
219.937	they came from data management,
221.854	they came from scientific imaging and program management.
224.771	And they got together to work on this manuscript.
228.327	The first problem was a conservation problem.
232.138	And this is the sort of thing that we had to deal with:
234.571	There was glue on the spine of the book.
236.771	And if you look at this photograph carefully,
238.972	the bottom half of this is rather brown.
241.02	And that glue is hide glue.
242.388	Now if you're a conservator,
243.773	you can take off this glue reasonably easily.
245.905	The top half is Elmer's wood glue.
249.27	It's polyvinyl acetate emulsion
251.387	that doesn't dissolve in water once it's dry.
254.054	And it's much tougher than the parchment that it was written on.
257.22	And so before we could start imaging Archimedes,
260.571	we had to take this book apart.
262.02	So it took four years to take apart.
264.871	And this is a rare action shot, ladies and gentlemen.
268.404	(Laughter)
271.175	Another thing is that we had to get rid of all the wax,
275.441	because this was used in the liturgical services
277.676	of the Greek Orthodox Church
279.417	and they'd used candle wax.
280.728	And the candle wax was dirty,
282.591	and we couldn't image through the wax.
283.824	So very carefully we had to mechanically scrape off all the wax.
287.159	It's hard to tell you exactly
289.061	how bad this condition of this book is,
291.775	but it came out in little bits very often.
294.541	And normally in a book, you wouldn't worry about the little bits,
296.891	but these little bits might contain unique Archimedes text.
299.891	So, tiny fragments
302.19	we actually managed to put back in the right place.
306.931	Then, having done that, we started to image the manuscript.
310.641	And we imaged the manuscript
312.141	in 14 different wavebands of light.
314.169	Because if you look at something in different wavebands of light,
318.075	you see different things.
319.291	And here is an image of a page
320.858	imaged in 14 different wavebands of light.
323.375	But none of them worked.
325.508	So what we did was we processed the images together,
329.925	and we put two images into one blank screen.
333.225	And here are two different images of the Archimedes manuscript.
336.058	And the image on the left
337.874	is the normal red image.
339.225	And the image on the right is an ultraviolet image.
341.137	And in the image on the right
342.277	you might be able to see some of the Archimedes writing.
344.725	If you merge them together into one digital canvas,
347.707	the parchment is bright in both images
350.525	and it comes out bright.
352.4	The prayer book is dark in both images
355.416	and it comes out dark.
357.113	The Archimedes text is dark in one image and bright in another.
360.464	And it'll come out dark but red,
362.864	and then you can start to read it rather clearly.
365.131	And that's what it looks like.
367.973	Now that's a before and after image,
371.315	but you don't read the image on the screen like that.
374.297	You zoom in and you zoom in
376.916	and you zoom in and you zoom in,
380.464	and you can just read it now.
382.532	(Applause)
388.88	If you process the same two images in a different way,
392.46	you can actually get rid of the prayer book text.
395.03	And this is terribly important,
396.048	because the diagrams in the manuscript
399.031	are the unique source for the diagrams
401.498	that Archimedes drew in the sand in the fourth century B.C.
404.315	And there we are, I can give them to you.
407.354	With this kind of imaging --
409.698	this kind of infrared, ultraviolet, invisible light imaging --
412.364	we were never going to image through the gold ground forgeries.
414.964	How were we going to do that?
416.817	Well we took the manuscript,
418.78	and we decided to image it in X-ray fluorescence imaging.
423.067	So an X-ray comes in in the diagram on the left
426.081	and it knocks out an electron from the inner shell of an atom.
429.933	And that electron disappears.
431.931	And as it disappears, an electron from a shell farther out
435.566	jumps in and takes its place.
438.048	And when it takes its place,
439.481	it sheds electromagnetic radiation.
442.315	It sheds an X-ray.
443.747	And this X-ray is specific in its wavelength
446.398	to the atom that it hits.
448.28	And what we wanted to get
450.448	was the iron.
452.181	Because the ink was written in iron.
454.048	And if we can map
455.731	where this X-ray that comes out, where it comes from,
458.315	we can map all the iron on the page,
460.381	then theoretically we can read the image.
462.98	The thing is that you need a very powerful light source to do this.
467.315	So we took it to the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory
470.689	in California,
472.131	which is a particle accelerator.
473.699	Electrons go around one way,
475.431	positrons go around the other.
477.048	They meet in the middle,
478.364	and they create subatomic particles
480.8	like the charm quark and the tau lepton.
483.03	Now we weren't actually going to put Archimedes in that beam.
486.052	But as the electrons go round at the speed of light,
489.6	they shed X-rays.
490.867	And this is the most powerful light source in the solar system.
493.517	This is called synchrotron radiation,
495.466	and it's normally used to look at things
497.284	like proteins and that sort of thing.
498.951	But we wanted it to look at atoms, at iron atoms,
502.948	so that we could read the page from before and after.
505.817	And lo and behold, we found that we could do it.
508.115	It took about 17 minutes to do a single page.
511.563	So what did we discover?
514.218	Well one of the unique texts in Archimedes
516.4	"is called ""The Stomachion."""
518.203	And this didn't exist in Codices A and B.
520.617	And we knew that it involved this square.
523.036	And this is a perfect square,
524.829	and it's divided into 14 bits.
526.85	But no one knew what Archimedes was doing with these 14 bits.
529.633	And now we think we know.
531.817	He was trying to work out
533.584	how many ways you can recombine those 14 bits
536.117	and still make a perfect square.
538.444	Anyone want to guess the answer?
541.946	It's 17,152 divided into 536 families.
547.308	And the important point about this
549.675	is that it's the earliest study in combinatorics in mathematics.
553.389	And combinatorics is a wonderful and interesting branch of mathematics.
557.153	The really astonishing thing though about this manuscript
560.388	is that we looked at the other manuscripts
562.757	that the palimpsester had made,
564.175	the scribe had made his book out of,
566.741	and one of them was a manuscript containing text by Hyperides.
569.673	Now Hyperides was an Athenian orator from the fourth century B.C.
574.041	He was an exact contemporary of Demosthenes.
576.458	And in 338 B.C. he and Demosthenes together
580.857	decided that they wanted to stand up
582.541	to the military might of Philip of Macedon.
584.541	So Athens and Thebes went out to fight Philip of Macedon.
588.19	This was a bad idea,
589.458	because Philip of Macedon had a son called Alexander the Great,
592.891	and they lost the battle of Chaeronea.
595.174	Alexander the Great went on to conquer the known world;
597.892	Hyperides found himself on trial for treason.
600.642	And this is the speech that he gave when he was on trial --
604.242	and it's a great speech:
605.39	"""Best of all,"" he says, ""is to win."
607.658	But if you can't win,
609.392	then you should fight for a noble cause,
611.433	because then you'll be remembered.
613.008	Consider the Spartans.
614.606	They won enumerable victories,
616.474	but no one remembers what they are
618.306	because they were all fought for selfish ends.
620.441	The one battle that the Spartans fought that everybody remembers
624.007	is the the battle of Thermopylae
625.723	where they were butchered to a man,
627.726	"but fought for the freedom of Greece."""
629.658	It was such a great speech
631.923	that the Athenian law courts let him off.
635.658	He lived for another 10 years,
637.724	then the Macedonian faction caught up with him.
640.375	They cut out his tongue in mockery of his oratory,
642.959	and no one knows what they did with his body.
646.39	So this is the discovery of a lost voice from antiquity,
649.541	speaking to us, not from the grave,
651.523	because his grave doesn't exist,
653.001	but from the Athenian law courts.
654.774	Now I should say at this point
656.423	that normally when you're looking
659.19	at medieval manuscripts that have been scraped off,
661.186	you don't find unique texts.
662.672	And to find two in one manuscript is really something.
665.774	To find three is completely weird.
668.991	And we found three.
670.672	"Aristotle's ""Categories"""
671.938	is one of the foundational texts of Western philosophy.
674.391	And we found a third century A.D. commentary on it,
678.807	possibly by Galen and probably by Porphyry.
681.991	Now all this data that we collected,
684.189	all the images, all the raw images,
686.724	all the transcriptions that we made and that sort of thing
689.074	have been put online under a Creative Commons license
692.56	for anyone to use for any commercial purpose.
695.474	(Applause)
702.007	Why did the owner of the manuscript do this?
705.311	He did this because he understands data as well as books.
709.057	Now the thing to do with books,
710.392	if you want to ensure their long-term utility,
712.523	is to hide them away in closets
714.739	and let very few people look at them.
716.539	The thing to do with data, if you want it to survive,
718.958	is to let it out and have everybody have it
722.259	with as little control on that data as possible.
725.358	And that's what he did.
726.522	And institutions can learn from this.
729.95	Because institutions at the moment
732.502	confine their data with copyright restrictions and that sort of thing.
735.559	And if you want to look at medieval manuscripts on the Web,
737.751	at the moment you have to go to the National Library of Y's site
741.222	or the University Library of X's site,
743.89	which is about the most boring way
745.789	in which you can deal with digital data.
747.566	What you want to do is to aggregate it all together.
750.559	Because the Web of the ancient manuscripts of the future
753.656	isn't going to be built by institutions.
755.942	It's going to be built by users,
759.05	by people who get this data together,
760.824	by people who want to aggregate all sorts of maps
764.359	from wherever they come from,
765.991	all sorts of medieval romances
767.791	from wherever they come from,
769.34	people who just want to curate their own glorious selection
773.123	of beautiful things.
774.64	And that is the future of the Web.
776.257	And it's an attractive and beautiful future,
779.44	if only we can make it happen.
781.042	Now we at the Walters Art Museum have followed this example,
784.223	and we have put up all our manuscripts on the Web
787.573	for people to enjoy --
789.256	all the raw data, all the descriptions, all the metadata.
791.84	under a Creative Commons license.
794.723	Now the Walters Art Museum is a small museum
796.241	and it has beautiful manuscripts,
797.789	but the data is fantastic.
799.807	And the result of this
801.59	is that if you do a Google search on images right now
804.608	"and you type in ""Illuminated manuscript Koran"" for example,"
812.357	(Applause)
817.907	Now, let's think about this for a minute.
822.94	What's in it for the institution?
824.923	There are all sorts of things that are in it for the institution.
827.519	You can talk about the Humanities and that sort of thing,
829.642	but let's talk about selfish things.
831.523	Because what's really in it for the institution is this:
835.391	Now why do people go to the Louvre?
838.447	They go to see the Mona Lisa.
841.431	Why do they go to see the Mona Lisa?
844.49	Because they already know what she looks like.
846.872	And they know what she looks like
849.206	because they've seen pictures of her absolutely everywhere.
853.908	Now, there is no need
858.357	for these restrictions at all.
860.636	And I think that institutions should stand up
862.723	and release all their data under unrestricted licenses,
865.857	and it would be a great benefit to everybody.
868.073	Why don't we just let everybody have access to this data
871.239	and curate their own collection
873.575	of ancient knowledge and wonderful and beautiful things
875.74	and increase the beauty and the cultural significance
878.828	of the Internet.
880.056	Thank you very much indeed.
881.573	(Applause)
