16.037	Today, I'm going to talk to you about sketching electronics.
20.453	I'm, among several other things, an electrical engineer,
25.821	and that means that I spend a good amount of time
29.518	designing and building new pieces of technology,
33.892	and more specifically designing and building electronics.
38.432	And what I've found is that the process of designing
42.79	and building electronics is problematic in all sorts of ways.
48.384	So it's a really slow process, it's really expensive,
53.225	and the outcome of that process,
55.665	namely electronic circuit boards,
58.081	are limited in all sorts of kind of interesting ways.
61.11	So they're really small, generally, they're square
64.75	and flat and hard, and frankly, most of them
69.115	just aren't very attractive, and so my team and I
73.428	have been thinking of ways to really change and mix up
77.416	the process and the outcome of designing electronics.
82.077	And so what if you could design and build electronics
86.165	like this? So what if you could do it extremely quickly,
90.205	extremely inexpensively, and maybe more interestingly,
95.87	really fluidly and expressively and even improvisationally?
101.134	Wouldn't that be so cool, and that wouldn't that open up
104.456	all sorts of new possibilities?
106.904	I'm going to share with you two projects that are
110.288	investigations along these lines, and we'll start with this one.
114.997	(Video) Magnetic electronic pieces and ferrous paper.
120.734	A conductive pen from the Lewis lab at UIUC.
124.566	Sticker templates.
127.44	Speed x 4.
145.519	Making a switch.
157.469	Music: DJ Shadow.
175.435	Adding some intelligence with a microcontroller.
191.995	Sketching an interface.
199.528	(Music)
208.895	(Laughter)
213.065	(Applause)
218.771	Pretty cool, huh? We think so.
221.768	So now that we developed these tools
225.552	and found these materials that let us do these things,
229.29	we started to realize that, essentially, anything
233.458	that we can do with paper, anything that we can do
235.842	with a piece of paper and a pen
238.257	we can now do with electronics.
240.674	So the next project that I want to show you is kind of a
243.042	deeper exploration of that possibility.
246.602	And I'll kind of let it speak for itself.
250.466	(Music)
340.912	(Applause)
346.28	So the next step for us in this process
351.08	is now to find a way to let all of you
354.808	build things like this,
357.704	and so the way that we're approaching that is by
360.784	teaching workshops to people where we explain
363.391	how they can use these kinds of tools, and then also
366.504	working to get the tools and the materials and techniques
370.246	out into the real world in a variety of ways.
373.996	And so sometime soon, you'll be able to play and build
377.58	and sketch with electronics in this fundamentally new way.
381.374	So thank you very much. (Applause)
