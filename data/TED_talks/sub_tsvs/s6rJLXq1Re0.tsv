12.612	For the next 16 minutes,
12.612	I'm going to take you on a journey
15.398	that is probably
15.398	the biggest dream of humanity:
18.508	to understand the code of life.
21.072	So for me, everything started
21.072	many, many years ago
23.839	when I met the first 3D printer.
26.586	The concept was fascinating.
28.284	A 3D printer needs three elements:
30.33	a bit of information, some
30.33	raw material, some energy,
34.488	and it can produce any object
34.488	that was not there before.
38.517	I was doing physics,
38.517	I was coming back home
40.678	and I realized that I actually
40.678	always knew a 3D printer.
44.14	And everyone does.
45.5	It was my mom.
46.682	(Laughter)
47.707	My mom takes three elements:
50.145	a bit of information, which is between
50.145	my father and my mom in this case,
54.142	raw elements and energy
54.142	in the same media, that is food,
58.323	and after several months, produces me.
60.855	And I was not existent before.
62.691	So apart from the shock of my mom
62.691	discovering that she was a 3D printer,
66.477	I immediately got mesmerized
66.477	by that piece,
71.239	the first one, the information.
72.98	What amount of information does it take
75.255	to build and assemble a human?
77.215	Is it much? Is it little?
78.813	How many thumb drives can you fill?
81.017	Well, I was studying physics
81.017	at the beginning
83.665	and I took this approximation of a human
83.665	as a gigantic Lego piece.
89.286	So, imagine that the building
89.286	blocks are little atoms
93.095	and there is a hydrogen here,
93.095	a carbon here, a nitrogen here.
97.772	So in the first approximation,
99.367	if I can list the number of atoms
99.367	that compose a human being,
103.734	I can build it.
105.145	Now, you can run some numbers
107.198	and that happens to be
107.198	quite an astonishing number.
110.499	So the number of atoms,
113.28	the file that I will save in my thumb
113.28	drive to assemble a little baby,
118.059	will actually fill an entire Titanic
118.059	of thumb drives --
122.75	multiplied 2,000 times.
125.957	This is the miracle of life.
129.382	Every time you see from now on
129.382	a pregnant lady,
132.018	she's assembling the biggest
132.018	amount of information
134.898	that you will ever encounter.
136.478	Forget big data, forget
136.478	anything you heard of.
139.452	This is the biggest amount
139.452	of information that exists.
142.357	(Applause)
146.214	But nature, fortunately, is much smarter
146.214	than a young physicist,
150.882	and in four billion years, managed
150.882	to pack this information
154.482	in a small crystal we call DNA.
157.605	We met it for the first time in 1950
157.605	when Rosalind Franklin,
161.941	an amazing scientist, a woman,
163.521	took a picture of it.
164.934	But it took us more than 40 years
164.934	to finally poke inside a human cell,
170.146	take out this crystal,
171.772	unroll it, and read it for the first time.
175.615	The code comes out to be
175.615	a fairly simple alphabet,
178.88	four letters: A, T, C and G.
182.676	And to build a human,
182.676	you need three billion of them.
186.933	Three billion.
188.136	How many are three billion?
189.739	It doesn't really make
189.739	any sense as a number, right?
192.525	So I was thinking how
192.525	I could explain myself better
196.634	about how big and enormous this code is.
199.708	But there is -- I mean,
199.708	I'm going to have some help,
202.786	and the best person to help me
202.786	introduce the code
206.037	is actually the first man
206.037	to sequence it, Dr. Craig Venter.
209.583	So welcome onstage, Dr. Craig Venter.
212.997	(Applause)
219.952	Not the man in the flesh,
223.448	but for the first time in history,
225.817	this is the genome of a specific human,
229.303	printed page-by-page, letter-by-letter:
	from the United States to Canada
241.495	thanks to Bruno Bowden,
241.495	Lulu.com, a start-up, did everything.
246.362	It was an amazing feat.
247.849	But this is the visual perception
247.849	of what is the code of life.
252.17	And now, for the first time,
252.17	I can do something fun.
254.672	I can actually poke inside it and read.
257.243	So let me take an interesting
257.243	book ... like this one.
265.077	I have an annotation;
265.077	it's a fairly big book.
267.635	So just to let you see
267.635	what is the code of life.
272.566	Thousands and thousands and thousands
275.981	and millions of letters.
278.675	And they apparently make sense.
281.095	Let's get to a specific part.
283.571	Let me read it to you:
284.957	(Laughter)
286.002	"""AAG, AAT, ATA."""
290.965	To you it sounds like mute letters,
293.056	but this sequence gives
293.056	the color of the eyes to Craig.
297.633	I'll show you another part of the book.
299.589	This is actually a little
299.589	more complicated.
302.983	Chromosome 14, book 132:
305.654	(Laughter)
307.768	As you might expect.
309.069	(Laughter)
314.857	"""ATT, CTT, GATT."""
320.329	This human is lucky,
322.04	because if you miss just
322.04	two letters in this position --
326.581	two letters of our three billion --
328.482	he will be condemned
328.482	to a terrible disease:
330.525	cystic fibrosis.
331.989	We have no cure for it,
331.989	we don't know how to solve it,
335.426	and it's just two letters
335.426	of difference from what we are.
339.585	A wonderful book, a mighty book,
343.115	a mighty book that helped me understand
345.137	and show you something quite remarkable.
348.48	Every one of you -- what makes
348.48	me, me and you, you --
352.939	is just about five million of these,
355.917	half a book.
358.015	For the rest,
359.702	we are all absolutely identical.
363.008	Five hundred pages
363.008	is the miracle of life that you are.
367.05	The rest, we all share it.
369.605	So think about that again
369.605	when we think that we are different.
372.538	This is the amount that we share.
375.441	So now that I have your attention,
378.894	the next question is:
380.277	How do I read it?
381.452	How do I make sense out of it?
383.409	Well, for however good you can be
383.409	at assembling Swedish furniture,
387.673	this instruction manual
387.673	is nothing you can crack in your life.
391.26	(Laughter)
392.887	And so, in 2014, two famous TEDsters,
396.023	Peter Diamandis and Craig Venter himself,
398.587	decided to assemble a new company.
400.538	Human Longevity was born,
401.974	with one mission:
403.368	trying everything we can try
405.253	and learning everything
405.253	we can learn from these books,
408.036	with one target --
410.862	making real the dream
410.862	of personalized medicine,
413.687	understanding what things
413.687	should be done to have better health
417.478	and what are the secrets in these books.
420.329	An amazing team, 40 data scientists
420.329	and many, many more people,
424.603	a pleasure to work with.
425.977	The concept is actually very simple.
428.254	We're going to use a technology
428.254	called machine learning.
431.436	On one side, we have genomes --
431.436	thousands of them.
435.999	On the other side, we collected
435.999	the biggest database of human beings:
440.02	phenotypes, 3D scan, NMR --
440.02	everything you can think of.
444.34	Inside there, on these two opposite sides,
447.263	there is the secret of translation.
449.729	And in the middle, we build a machine.
452.801	We build a machine
452.801	and we train a machine --
455.21	well, not exactly one machine,
455.21	many, many machines --
458.444	to try to understand and translate
458.444	the genome in a phenotype.
463.362	What are those letters,
463.362	and what do they do?
466.726	It's an approach that can
466.726	be used for everything,
469.497	but using it in genomics
469.497	is particularly complicated.
472.514	Little by little we grew and we wanted
472.514	to build different challenges.
475.814	We started from the beginning,
475.814	from common traits.
478.57	Common traits are comfortable
478.57	because they are common,
481.197	everyone has them.
482.405	So we started to ask our questions:
484.923	Can we predict height?
486.985	Can we read the books
486.985	and predict your height?
489.186	Well, we actually can,
490.361	with five centimeters of precision.
492.178	BMI is fairly connected to your lifestyle,
495.337	but we still can, we get in the ballpark,
495.337	eight kilograms of precision.
499.225	Can we predict eye color?
500.48	Yeah, we can.
501.662	Eighty percent accuracy.
503.466	Can we predict skin color?
505.348	Yeah we can, 80 percent accuracy.
507.813	Can we predict age?
510.121	We can, because apparently,
510.121	the code changes during your life.
513.884	It gets shorter, you lose pieces,
513.884	it gets insertions.
517.19	We read the signals, and we make a model.
520.438	Now, an interesting challenge:
521.937	Can we predict a human face?
525.014	It's a little complicated,
526.316	because a human face is scattered
526.316	among millions of these letters.
529.531	And a human face is not
529.531	a very well-defined object.
532.184	So, we had to build an entire tier of it
534.259	to learn and teach
534.259	a machine what a face is,
536.993	and embed and compress it.
539.054	And if you're comfortable
539.054	with machine learning,
541.326	you understand what the challenge is here.
544.108	Now, after 15 years -- 15 years after
544.108	we read the first sequence --
550.123	this October, we started
550.123	to see some signals.
553.049	And it was a very emotional moment.
555.528	What you see here is a subject
555.528	coming in our lab.
559.619	This is a face for us.
561.571	So we take the real face of a subject,
561.571	we reduce the complexity,
565.226	because not everything is in your face --
567.22	lots of features and defects
567.22	and asymmetries come from your life.
571.03	We symmetrize the face,
571.03	and we run our algorithm.
575.245	The results that I show you right now,
577.167	this is the prediction we have
577.167	from the blood.
581.596	(Applause)
583.144	Wait a second.
584.603	In these seconds, your eyes are watching,
584.603	left and right, left and right,
589.319	and your brain wants
589.319	those pictures to be identical.
593.273	So I ask you to do
593.273	another exercise, to be honest.
595.743	Please search for the differences,
598.054	which are many.
599.439	The biggest amount of signal
599.439	comes from gender,
602.066	then there is age, BMI,
602.066	the ethnicity component of a human.
607.291	And scaling up over that signal
607.291	is much more complicated.
611.026	But what you see here,
611.026	even in the differences,
614.3	lets you understand
614.3	that we are in the right ballpark,
617.919	that we are getting closer.
619.291	And it's already giving you some emotions.
621.664	This is another subject
621.664	that comes in place,
624.391	and this is a prediction.
625.824	A little smaller face, we didn't get
625.824	the complete cranial structure,
630.444	but still, it's in the ballpark.
633.634	This is a subject that comes in our lab,
635.882	and this is the prediction.
638.056	So these people have never been seen
638.056	in the training of the machine.
642.756	"These are the so-called ""held-out"" set."
645.617	But these are people that you will
645.617	probably never believe.
649.381	We're publishing everything
649.381	in a scientific publication,
652.081	you can read it.
653.256	But since we are onstage,
653.256	Chris challenged me.
655.624	I probably exposed myself
655.624	and tried to predict
659.274	someone that you might recognize.
662.47	So, in this vial of blood --
662.47	and believe me, you have no idea
666.919	what we had to do to have
666.919	this blood now, here --
669.823	in this vial of blood is the amount
669.823	of biological information
673.748	that we need to do a full genome sequence.
676.049	We just need this amount.
678.528	We ran this sequence,
678.528	and I'm going to do it with you.
681.757	And we start to layer up
681.757	all the understanding we have.
685.76	In the vial of blood,
685.76	we predicted he's a male.
689.134	And the subject is a male.
690.996	We predict that he's a meter and 76 cm.
693.458	The subject is a meter and 77 cm.
695.874	So, we predicted that he's 76;
695.874	the subject is 82.
700.701	We predict his age, 38.
703.357	The subject is 35.
705.851	We predict his eye color.
708.824	Too dark.
710.059	We predict his skin color.
712.026	We are almost there.
713.899	That's his face.
717.172	Now, the reveal moment:
720.465	the subject is this person.
722.259	(Laughter)
724.218	And I did it intentionally.
726.3	I am a very particular
726.3	and peculiar ethnicity.
730.016	Southern European, Italians --
730.016	they never fit in models.
732.99	And it's particular -- that ethnicity
732.99	is a complex corner case for our model.
738.144	But there is another point.
739.677	So, one of the things that we use
739.677	a lot to recognize people
743.178	will never be written in the genome.
744.924	It's our free will, it's how I look.
747.265	Not my haircut in this case,
747.265	but my beard cut.
750.518	So I'm going to show you, I'm going to,
750.518	in this case, transfer it --
754.095	and this is nothing more
754.095	than Photoshop, no modeling --
756.884	the beard on the subject.
758.621	And immediately, we get
758.621	much, much better in the feeling.
762.955	So, why do we do this?
767.938	We certainly don't do it
767.938	for predicting height
773.102	or taking a beautiful picture
773.102	out of your blood.
776.39	We do it because the same technology
776.39	and the same approach,
780.432	the machine learning of this code,
782.976	is helping us to understand how we work,
786.137	how your body works,
787.647	how your body ages,
789.336	how disease generates in your body,
792.129	how your cancer grows and develops,
795.125	how drugs work
796.932	and if they work on your body.
799.713	This is a huge challenge.
801.894	This is a challenge that we share
803.556	with thousands of other
803.556	researchers around the world.
806.159	It's called personalized medicine.
809.125	It's the ability to move
809.125	from a statistical approach
812.609	where you're a dot in the ocean,
814.665	to a personalized approach,
816.502	where we read all these books
818.711	and we get an understanding
818.711	of exactly how you are.
822.26	But it is a particularly
822.26	complicated challenge,
825.646	because of all these books, as of today,
829.668	we just know probably two percent:
833.027	four books of more than 175.
838.021	And this is not the topic of my talk,
842.145	because we will learn more.
845.378	There are the best minds
845.378	in the world on this topic.
849.048	The prediction will get better,
850.906	the model will get more precise.
853.183	And the more we learn,
855.065	the more we will
855.065	be confronted with decisions
859.919	that we never had to face before
862.964	about life,
864.423	about death,
866.121	about parenting.
872.626	So, we are touching the very
872.626	inner detail on how life works.
878.118	And it's a revolution
878.118	that cannot be confined
881.3	in the domain of science or technology.
884.96	This must be a global conversation.
887.798	We must start to think of the future
887.798	we're building as a humanity.
893.039	We need to interact with creatives,
893.039	with artists, with philosophers,
897.127	with politicians.
898.661	Everyone is involved,
899.843	because it's the future of our species.
903.273	Without fear, but with the understanding
907.265	that the decisions
907.265	that we make in the next year
911.16	will change the course of history forever.
915.732	Thank you.
916.916	(Applause)
