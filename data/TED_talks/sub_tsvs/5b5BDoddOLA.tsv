12.657	(Video) Nicholas Negroponte: 
12.657	Can we switch to the video disc,
15.111	which is in play mode?
17.234	I'm really interested in how you put people and computers together.
22.464	We will be using the TV screens or their equivalents
25.834	for electronic books of the future.
30.208	(Music, crosstalk)
50.117	Very interested in touch-sensitive displays,
52.369	high-tech, high-touch, not having
52.369	to pick up your fingers to use them.
56.696	There is another way where computers
58.496	touch people: wearing, physically wearing.
68.646	Suddenly on September 11th,
70.667	the world got bigger.
73.304	NN: Thank you. (Applause)
76.289	Thank you.
78.348	When I was asked to do this,
80.456	I was also asked to look at all 14 TED Talks
84.652	that I had given,
86.362	chronologically.
88.16	The first one was actually two hours.
90.434	The second one was an hour,
91.89	and then they became half hours,
93.439	and all I noticed was my bald spot getting bigger.
97.375	(Laughter)
98.995	Imagine seeing your life, 30 years of it, go by,
103.163	and it was, to say the least,
106.57	for me, quite a shocking experience.
110.943	So what I'm going to do in my time
112.536	is try and share with you what happened
114.08	during the 30 years,
115.882	and then also make a prediction,
118.4	and then tell you a little bit
120.461	about what I'm doing next.
123.115	And I put on a slide
126.066	where TED 1 happened in my life.
130.126	And it's rather important
132.04	because I had done 15 years of research before it,
136.1	so I had a backlog, so it was easy.
138.528	It's not that I was Fidel Castro
140.288	and I could talk for two hours,
142.121	or Bucky Fuller.
143.443	I had 15 years of stuff,
145.358	and the Media Lab was about to start.
147.83	So that was easy.
149.63	But there are a couple of things
152.294	about that period
153.982	and about what happened that are
156.035	really quite important.
157.89	One is that
160.446	it was a period when computers
163.342	weren't yet for people.
165.979	And the other thing that sort of happened
169.124	during that time is that
172.195	we were considered sissy computer scientists.
175.577	We weren't considered the real thing.
177.14	So what I'm going to show you is, in retrospect,
181.139	a lot more interesting and a lot more accepted
183.647	than it was at the time.
185.713	So I'm going to characterize the years
188.267	and I'm even going to go back
190.1	to some very early work of mine,
192.204	and this was the kind of stuff I was doing in the '60s:
195.09	very direct manipulation,
197.277	very influenced as I studied architecture
199.932	by the architect Moshe Safdie,
202.019	and you can see that we even built robotic things
204.781	that could build habitat-like structures.
207.537	And this for me was
209.224	not yet the Media Lab,
211.14	but was the beginning of what I'll call
213.957	sensory computing,
215.476	and I pick fingers
217.348	partly because everybody thought it was ridiculous.
221.55	Papers were published
223.705	about how stupid it was to use fingers.
227.957	Three reasons: One was they were low-resolution.
230.775	The other is your hand would occlude
232.704	what you wanted to see,
234.145	and the third, which was the winner,
235.903	was that your fingers would get the screen dirty,
239.559	and hence, fingers would never be
241.885	a device that you'd use.
243.673	And this was a device we built in the '70s,
246.722	which has never even been picked up.
248.593	It's not just touch sensitive,
250.034	it's pressure sensitive.
252.212	(Video) Voice: Put a yellow circle there.
254.189	NN: Later work, and again this was before TED 1 —
257.633	(Video) Voice: Move that west of the diamond.
260.436	Create a large green circle there.
263.648	Man: Aw, shit.
265.977	NN: — was to sort of do interface concurrently,
269.407	so when you talked and you pointed
271.215	and you had, if you will,
274.402	multiple channels.
275.961	Entebbe happened.
281.515	taken to Entebbe,
283.013	and the Israelis not only did an extraordinary rescue,
288.07	they did it partly because they had practiced
290.033	on a physical model of the airport,
292.528	because they had built the airport,
293.684	so they built a model in the desert,
295.417	and when they arrived at Entebbe,
297.133	they knew where to go because
297.133	they had actually been there.
300.053	The U.S. government asked some of us, '76,
303.305	if we could replicate that computationally,
306.08	and of course somebody like myself says yes.
308.269	Immediately, you get a contract,
310.295	Department of Defense,
311.78	and we built this truck and this rig.
314.468	We did sort of a simulation,
316.988	because you had video discs,
318.814	and again, this is '76.
321.142	And then many years later,
323.839	you get this truck,
325.308	and so you have Google Maps.
328.266	Still people thought,
329.786	no, that was not serious computer science,
333.806	and it was a man named Jerry Wiesner,
335.865	who happened to be the president of MIT,
338.272	who did think it was computer science.
340.62	And one of the keys for anybody
343.257	who wants to start something in life:
346.641	Make sure your president is part of it.
349.91	So when I was doing the Media Lab,
352.93	it was like having a gorilla in the front seat.
356.087	If you were stopped for speeding
358.272	and the officer looked in the window
360.512	and saw who was in the passenger seat,
362.521	"then, ""Oh, continue on, sir."""
364.483	And so we were able,
366.168	and this is a cute, actually, device, parenthetically.
369.961	This was a lenticular photograph of Jerry Wiesner
373.01	where the only thing that changed in the photograph
375.373	were the lips.
376.716	So when you oscillated that little piece
379.692	of lenticular sheet with his photograph,
382.922	it would be in lip sync
384.935	with zero bandwidth.
387.174	It was a zero-bandwidth teleconferencing system
389.885	at the time.
391.727	So this was the Media Lab's —
395.708	this is what we said we'd do,
397.401	that the world of computers, publishing,
399.976	and so on would come together.
402.664	Again, not generally accepted,
404.768	but very much part of TED in the early days.
409.74	And this is really where we were headed.
412.946	And that created the Media Lab.
414.633	One of the things about age
418.884	is that I can tell you with great confidence,
423.151	I've been to the future.
425.615	I've been there, actually, many times.
428.899	And the reason I say that is,
430.407	how many times in my life have I said,
432.848	"""Oh, in 10 years, this will happen,"""
434.625	and then 10 years comes.
436.673	"And then you say, ""Oh, in"
436.673	"five years, this will happen."""
438.431	And then five years comes.
440.115	So I say this a little bit with having felt
443.873	that I'd been there a number of times,
446.21	and one of the things that is most quoted
449.85	that I've ever said
450.999	is that computing is not about computers,
453.382	and that didn't quite get enough traction,
456.938	and then it started to.
458.457	It started to because people caught on
462.152	that the medium wasn't the message.
465.29	And the reason I show this car
467.935	in actually a rather ugly slide
470.263	is just again to tell you the kind of story
472.767	that characterized a little bit of my life.
475.595	This is a student of mine
477.609	"who had done a Ph.D. called ""Backseat Driver."""
481.16	It was in the early days of GPS,
483.242	the car knew where it was,
484.808	and it would give audio instructions
486.723	to the driver, when to turn right, 
486.723	when to turn left and so on.
490.15	Turns out, there are a lot of things
491.761	in those instructions that back in that period
494.796	were pretty challenging,
496.046	like what does it mean, take the next right?
499.274	Well, if you're coming up on a street,
501.174	the next right's probably the one after,
503.357	and there are lots of issues,
504.588	and the student did a wonderful thesis,
506.833	"and the MIT patent office said ""Don't patent it."
511.68	It'll never be accepted.
513.62	The liabilities are too large.
515.93	There will be insurance issues.
517.321	"Don't patent it."""
518.965	So we didn't,
520.058	but it shows you how people, again, at times,
523.696	don't really look at what's happening.
527.895	Some work, and I'll just go
527.895	through these very quickly,
530.79	a lot of sensory stuff.
532.395	You might recognize a young Yo-Yo Ma
534.87	and tracking his body for playing
538.84	the cello or the hypercello.
541.188	These fellows literally walked 
541.188	around like that at the time.
545.165	It's now a little bit more discreet
547.8	and more commonplace.
549.841	And then there are at least three heroes
552.11	I want to quickly mention.
553.239	Marvin Minsky, who taught me a lot
555.717	about common sense,
557.104	and I will talk briefly about Muriel Cooper,
560.545	who was very important to Ricky Wurman
563.163	and to TED, and in fact, when she got onstage,
566.898	she said, the first thing she said was,
568.845	"""I introduced Ricky to Nicky."""
570.999	And nobody calls me Nicky
572.699	and nobody calls Richard Ricky,
574.458	so nobody knew who she was talking about.
577.86	And then, of course, Seymour Papert,
580.257	who is the person who said,
581.762	"""You can't think about thinking"
583.177	"unless you think about thinking about something."""
585.592	And that's actually — you can unpack that later.
591.255	It's a pretty profound statement.
595.361	I'm showing some slides
597.101	that were from TED 2,
599.187	a little silly as slides, perhaps.
602.929	Then I felt television really was about displays.
608.273	Again, now we're past TED 1,
611.336	but just around the time of TED 2,
614.362	and what I'd like to mention here is,
616.511	even though you could imagine
618.626	intelligence in the device,
620.68	I look today at some of the work
622.112	being done about the Internet of Things,
624.55	and I think it's kind of tragically pathetic,
627.49	because what has happened is people take
629.92	the oven panel and put it on your cell phone,
633.418	or the door key onto your cell phone,
635.207	just taking it and bringing it to you,
637.38	and in fact that's actually what you don't want.
640.101	You want to put a chicken in the oven,
642.159	"and the oven says, ""Aha, it's a chicken,"""
644.487	and it cooks the chicken.
645.636	"""Oh, it's cooking the chicken for Nicholas,"
647.402	"and he likes it this way and that way."""
649.236	So the intelligence, instead of being in the device,
652.289	we have started today
653.998	to move it back onto the cell phone
656.11	or closer to the user,
658.48	not a particularly enlightened view
660.668	of the Internet of Things.
663.409	Television, again, television what I said today,
666.873	that was back in 1990,
669.495	and the television of tomorrow
670.965	would look something like that.
673.288	Again, people, but they laughed cynically,
676.832	they didn't laugh with much appreciation.
682.083	Telecommunications in the 1990s,
684.733	George Gilder decided that he would call this diagram
690.433	the Negroponte switch.
692.862	I'm probably much less famous than George,
694.868	so when he called it the Negroponte switch, it stuck,
698.475	but the idea of things that came in the ground
701.14	would go in the air and stuff in the air
702.855	would go into the ground
704.314	has played itself out.
706.199	That is the original slide from that year,
710.944	and it has worked in lockstep obedience.
714.319	We started Wired magazine.
716.486	Some people, I remember we shared
720.222	the reception desk periodically,
722.944	and some parent called up irate that his son
727.002	had given up Sports Illustrated
729.231	to subscribe for Wired,
731.11	"and he said, ""Are you some"
731.11	"porno magazine or something?"""
734.307	and couldn't understand why his son
736.891	would be interested in Wired, at any rate.
740.79	I will go through this a little quicker.
743.394	This is my favorite, 1995,
746.893	back page of Newsweek magazine.
749.93	Okay. Read it. (Laughter)
751.899	"[""Nicholas Negroponte, director of the MIT Media Lab, predicts that we'll soon buy books and newspapers straight over the Internet. Uh, sure."""
751.899	—Clifford Stoll, Newsweek, 1995]
753.8	You must admit that gives you,
755.445	at least it gives me pleasure
757.672	when somebody says how dead wrong you are.
761.43	"""Being Digital"" came out."
763.576	For me, it gave me an opportunity
766.217	to be more in the trade press
768.419	and get this out to the public,
771.69	and it also allowed us to build the new Media Lab,
774.705	which if you haven't been to, visit,
776.638	because it's a beautiful piece of architecture
779.657	aside from being a wonderful place to work.
782.482	So these are the things we were saying in those TEDs.
785.177	[Today, multimedia is a desktop or living room experience, because the apparatus is so clunky. This will change dramatically with small, bright, thin, high-resolution displays. — 1995]
786.744	We came to them.
788.236	I looked forward to it every year.
790.228	It was the party that Ricky Wurman never had
793.28	in the sense that he invited many of his old friends,
796.189	including myself.
797.848	And then something for me changed
800.24	pretty profoundly.
801.709	I became more involved with computers and learning
805.662	and influenced by Seymour,
808.124	but particularly looking at learning
810.739	as something that is best approximated
814.649	by computer programming.
816.403	When you write a computer program,
818.417	you've got to not just list things out
821.212	and sort of take an algorithm
822.94	and translate it into a set of instructions,
825.816	but when there's a bug, and all programs have bugs,
828.499	you've got to de-bug it.
830.208	You've got to go in, change it,
832.198	and then re-execute,
833.82	and you iterate,
835.624	and that iteration is really
838.531	a very, very good approximation of learning.
841.434	So that led to my own work with Seymour
845.101	in places like Cambodia
847.459	and the starting of One Laptop per Child.
850.363	Enough TED Talks on One Laptop per Child,
853.177	so I'll go through it very fast,
854.938	but it did give us the chance
858.863	to do something at a relatively large scale
862.369	in the area of learning, development and computing.
866.362	Very few people know that One Laptop per Child
869.179	was a $1 billion project,
871.814	and it was, at least over the seven years I ran it,
874.461	but even more important, the World Bank
876.607	contributed zero, USAID zero.
879.722	It was mostly the countries
879.722	using their own treasuries,
883.877	which is very interesting,
885.48	at least to me it was very interesting
886.836	in terms of what I plan to do next.
889.98	So these are the various places it happened.
893.005	I then tried an experiment,
895.907	and the experiment happened in Ethiopia.
900.188	And here's the experiment.
902.83	The experiment is,
904.461	can learning happen where there are no schools.
908.241	And we dropped off tablets
910.771	with no instructions
913.014	and let the children figure it out.
916.287	And in a short period of time,
919.934	they not only
922.032	turned them on and were using 50 apps per child
925.104	within five days,
927.206	"they were singing ""ABC"" songs within two weeks,"
930.14	but they hacked Android within six months.
934.033	And so that seemed sufficiently interesting.
937.551	This is perhaps the best picture I have.
940.11	The kid on your right
944.261	has sort of nominated himself as teacher.
946.736	Look at the kid on the left, and so on.
949.256	There are no adults involved in this at all.
952.406	So I said, well can we do this
953.83	at a larger scale?
955.427	And what is it that's missing?
957.908	The kids are giving a press conference at this point,
960.177	and sort of writing in the dirt.
962.862	And the answer is, what is missing?
966.307	And I'm going to skip over my prediction, actually,
968.843	because I'm running out of time,
970.371	and here's the question, is what's going to happen?
974.339	I think the challenge
975.826	is to connect the last billion people,
978.454	and connecting the last billion
981.105	is very different than connecting the next billion,
984.502	and the reason it's different
985.896	is that the next billion
987.76	are sort of low-hanging fruit,
989.71	but the last billion are rural.
993.077	Being rural and being poor
996.829	are very different.
997.961	Poverty tends to be created by our society,
1001.594	and the people in that community are not poor
1007.044	in the same way at all.
1008.953	They may be primitive,
1010.358	but the way to approach it and to connect them,
1014.402	the history of One Laptop per Child,
1016.933	and the experiment in Ethiopia,
1020.589	lead me to believe that we can in fact
1023.864	do this in a very short period of time.
1026.665	And so my plan,
1028.506	and unfortunately I haven't been able
1030.74	to get my partners at this point
1033.608	to let me announce them,
1034.899	but is to do this with a stationary satellite.
1039.806	There are many reasons
1042.265	that stationary satellites aren't the best things,
1046.78	but there are a lot of reasons why they are,
1049.717	and for two billion dollars,
1052.812	you can connect a lot more than 100 million people,
1056.496	but the reason I picked two,
1059.157	and I will leave this as my last slide,
1062.54	is two billion dollars
1064.324	is what we were spending
1067.243	in Afghanistan
1069.336	every week.
1071.248	So surely if we can connect
1074.555	Africa and the last billion people
1077.255	for numbers like that,
1078.809	we should be doing it.
1080.122	Thank you very much.
1082.419	(Applause)
1085.948	Chris Anderson: Stay up there. Stay up there.
1090.278	NN: You're going to give me extra time?
1092.308	CA: No. That was wickedly clever, wickedly clever.
1094.67	You gamed it beautifully.
1096.535	Nicholas, what is your prediction?
1099.165	(Laughter)
1101.191	NN: Thank you for asking.
1103.627	I'll tell you what my prediction is,
1106.4	and my prediction, and this is a prediction,
1109.1	because it'll be 30 years. I won't be here.
1111.762	But one of the things about learning how to read,
1116.49	we have been doing a lot of consuming
1119.339	of information going through our eyes,
1121.624	and so that may be a very inefficient channel.
1124.7	So my prediction is that we are 
1124.7	going to ingest information
1129.785	You're going to swallow a pill and know English.
1132.982	You're going to swallow a
1132.982	pill and know Shakespeare.
1135.674	And the way to do it is through the bloodstream.
1138.283	So once it's in your bloodstream,
1140.14	it basically goes through it and gets into the brain,
1142.358	and when it knows that it's in the brain
1144.54	in the different pieces,
1145.862	it deposits it in the right places.
1148.487	So it's ingesting.

1152.339	around with Ed Boyden
1155.552	and hanging around with one of the speakers
1157.397	who is here, Hugh Herr,
1159.21	and there are a number of people.
1161.107	This isn't quite as far-fetched,
1162.504	so 30 years from now.
1165.449	CA: We will check it out.
1167.191	We're going to be back and we're going
1167.191	to play this clip 30 years from now,
1169.493	and then all eat the red pill.
1172.524	Well thank you for that.
