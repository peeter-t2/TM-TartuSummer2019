12.8	Our lives depend
14.28	on a world we can't see.
16.92	Think about your week so far.
18.96	Have you watched TV, used GPS,
22.2	checked the weather or even ate a meal?
25.72	These many things
25.72	that enable our daily lives
28.44	rely either directly or indirectly
31.32	on satellites.
33.04	And while we often take for granted
35	the services that satellites provide us,
37.56	the satellites themselves
37.56	deserve our attention
40.4	as they are leaving a lasting mark
42.4	on the space they occupy.
44.72	People around the world
44.72	rely on satellite infrastructure every day
48.36	for information, entertainment
48.36	and to communicate.
52.44	There's agricultural
52.44	and environmental monitoring,
55.32	Internet connectivity, navigation.
58.4	Satellites even play a role
60.12	in the operation of our financial
60.12	and energy markets.
64.12	But these satellites that we rely on
66.04	day in and day out
67.72	have a finite life.
69.4	They might run out of propellant,
71.32	they could malfunction,
72.88	or they may just naturally
72.88	reach the end of their mission life.
76.599	At this point, these satellites
76.599	effectively become space junk,
80.76	cluttering the orbital environment.
83.84	So imagine you're driving down the highway
83.84	on a beautiful, sunny day
87.48	out running errands.
88.92	You've got your music cranked,
90.6	your windows rolled down,
92.08	with the cool breeze
92.08	blowing through your hair.
94.8	Feels nice, right?
96.64	Everything is going smoothly
99.04	until suddenly
99.04	your car stutters and stalls
101.72	right in the middle of the highway.
104.16	So now you have no choice
104.16	but to abandon your car
107.48	where it is on the highway.
110.2	Maybe you were lucky enough
111.56	to be able to move it out of the way
111.56	and into a shoulder lane
114.48	so that it's out of the way
114.48	of other traffic.
116.64	A couple of hours ago,
117.92	your car was a useful machine
117.92	that you relied on in your everyday life.
123	Now, it's a useless hunk of metal
125.56	taking up space in a valuable
125.56	transportation network.
129.92	And imagine international roadways
129.92	all cluttered with broken down vehicles
134.12	that are just getting in the way
134.12	of other traffic.
137	And imagine the debris
137	that would be strewn everywhere
139.92	if a collision actually happened,
142.4	thousands of smaller pieces of debris
144.8	becoming new obstacles.
147.68	This is the paradigm
147.68	of the satellite industry.
151.28	Satellites that are no longer working
153.44	are often left to deorbit
153.44	over many, many years,
157.28	or only moved out of the way
157.28	as a temporary solution.
160.84	And there are no
160.84	international laws in space
163.12	to enforce us to clean up after ourselves.
166.68	So the world's first satellite, Sputnik I,
168.96	was launched in 1957,
171.24	and in that year, there were
171.24	only a total of three launch attempts.
175.52	Decades later and dozens of countries
175.52	from all around the world
179.08	have launched thousands
179.08	of more satellites into orbit,
182.48	and the frequency of launches
182.48	is only going to increase in the future,
186.24	especially if you consider
186.24	things like the possibility
188.84	of 900-plus satellite
188.84	constellations being launched.
193.56	Now, we send satellites
193.56	to different orbits
195.64	depending on what they're needed for.
197.72	One of the most common places
197.72	we send satellites
200.08	is the low Earth orbit,
201.68	possibly to image the surface of Earth
203.68	at up to about 2,000 kilometers altitude.
206.72	Satellites there are naturally buffeted
206.72	by Earth's atmosphere,
210.2	so their orbits naturally decay,
212.16	and they'll eventually burn up,
213.72	probably within a couple of decades.
216.44	Another common place we send satellites
218.56	is the geostationary orbit
220.24	at about 35,000 kilometers altitude.
223.32	Satellites there remain in the same place
223.32	above Earth as the Earth rotates,
227.52	which enables things like communications
227.52	or television broadcast, for example.
232.44	Satellites in high orbits like these
232.44	could remain there for centuries.
237.96	And then there's the orbit
237.96	"coined ""the graveyard,"""
241.16	the ominous junk or disposal orbits,
243.8	where some satellites
243.8	are intentionally placed
246.68	at the end of their life
247.92	so that they're out of the way
247.92	of common operational orbits.
252.8	Of the nearly 7,000 satellites
252.8	launched since the late 1950s,
257.4	only about one in seven
257.4	is currently operational,
261.36	and in addition to the satellites
261.36	that are no longer working,
264.28	there's also hundreds of thousands
264.28	of marble-sized debris
267.8	and millions of paint chip-sized debris
270.24	that are also orbiting around the Earth.
272.88	Space debris is a major risk
272.88	to space missions,
275.68	but also to the satellites
275.68	that we rely on each and every day.
280.52	Now, because space debris and junk
280.52	has become increasingly worrisome,
283.96	there have been some national
283.96	and international efforts
286.6	to develop technical standards
288.12	to help us limit the generation
288.12	of additional debris.
291.48	So for example, there are recommendations
293.76	for those low-Earth orbiting spacecraft
295.88	to be made to deorbit in under 25 years,
299.32	but that's still a really long time,
301.44	especially if a satellite
301.44	hasn't been working for years.
305.32	There's also mandates
305.32	for those dead geostationary spacecraft
308.4	to be moved into a graveyard orbit.
311.48	But neither of these guidelines
311.48	is binding under international law,
315.2	and the understanding is that they will be
315.2	implemented through national mechanisms.
320	These guidelines are also not long-term,
322.48	they're not proactive,
323.92	nor do they address
323.92	the debris that's already up there.
327.28	They're only in place
327.28	to limit the future creation of debris.
331.68	Space junk is no one's responsibility.
335.68	Now, Mount Everest is actually
335.68	an interesting comparison
338.56	of a new approach to how
338.56	we interact with our environments,
341.8	as it's often given the dubious honor
344.12	of being the world's highest garbage dump.
348.04	Decades after the first conquest
348.04	of the world's highest peak,
351.32	tons of rubbish left behind by climbers
353.6	has started to raise concern,
355.56	and you may have read in the news
355.56	that there's speculation
358.32	that Nepal will crack down on mountaineers
360.4	with stricter enforcement
360.4	of penalties and legal obligations.
364.6	The goal, of course,
364.6	is to persuade climbers
367.04	to clean up after themselves,
369.24	so maybe local not-for-profits will pay
369.24	climbers who bring down extra waste,
374.16	or expeditions might organize
374.16	voluntary cleanup trips.
378.12	And yet still many climbers feel
380.4	that independent groups
380.4	should police themselves.
384.12	There's no simple or easy answer,
386.96	and even well-intentioned
386.96	efforts at conservation
390.04	often run into problems.
392.32	But that doesn't mean
392.32	we shouldn't do everything in our power
395.44	to protect the environments
395.44	that we rely and depend on,
399.44	and like Everest, the remote location
399.44	and inadequate infrastructure
403.48	of the orbital environment
404.92	make waste disposal a challenging problem.
407.92	But we simply cannot reach new heights
410.48	and create an even higher garbage dump,
413.56	one that's out of this world.
417.28	The reality of space
418.52	is that if a component
418.52	on a satellite breaks down,
421.12	there really are limited
421.12	opportunities for repairs,
424.04	and only at great cost.
426.76	But what if we were smarter
426.76	about how we designed satellites?
430.28	What if all satellites,
431.6	regardless of what country
431.6	they were built in,
433.92	had to be standardized in some way
435.84	for recycling, servicing
438.4	or active deorbiting?
440.56	What if there actually were
440.56	international laws with teeth
444.12	that enforced end-of-life
444.12	disposal of satellites
446.92	instead of moving them out of the way
449.08	as a temporary solution?
451.56	Or maybe satellite manufacturers
451.56	need to be charged a deposit
454.52	to even launch a satellite into orbit,
456.84	and that deposit would only be returned
459.32	if the satellite was disposed of properly
461.88	or if they cleaned up
461.88	some quota of debris.
465.44	Or maybe a satellite
465.44	needs to have technology on board
468.04	to help accelerate deorbit.
470.72	There are some encouraging signs.
473	The UK's TechDemoSat-1,
473	launched in 2014, for example,
477.72	was designed for end-of-life disposal
479.68	via a small drag sail.
481.64	This works for the satellite
481.64	because it's small,
484.24	but satellites that are higher
484.24	or in larger orbits
487.96	or are larger altogether,
487.96	like the size of school buses,
490.84	will require other disposal options.
493.28	So maybe you get into things
493.28	like high-powered lasers
496.28	or tugging using nets or tethers,
498.12	as crazy as those sound in the short term.
501.16	And then one really cool possibility
503.08	is the idea of orbital tow trucks
503.08	or space mechanics.
506.84	Imagine if a robotic arm
508.48	on some sort of space tow truck
510.36	could fix the broken components
510.36	on a satellite,
512.68	making them usable again.
515.24	Or what if that very same robotic arm
517.2	could refuel the propellant tank
517.2	on a spacecraft
519.56	that relies on chemical propulsion
521.56	just like you or I would refuel
521.56	the fuel tanks on our cars?
525.559	Robotic repair and maintenance
527.24	could extend the lives of hundreds
527.24	of satellites orbiting around the Earth.
532.28	Whatever the disposal
532.28	or cleanup options we come up with,
535.2	it's clearly not just a technical problem.
538.2	There's also complex space laws
538.2	and politics that we have to sort out.
543.28	Simply put, we haven't found a way
543.28	to use space sustainably yet.
548.72	Exploring, innovating
548.72	to change the way we live and work
551.64	are what we as humans do,
553.64	and in space exploration,
555.16	we're literally moving
555.16	beyond the boundaries of Earth.
558.44	But as we push thresholds
558.44	in the name of learning and innovation,
562.12	we must remember that accountability
562.12	for our environments never goes away.
568.52	There is without doubt congestion
568.52	in the low Earth and geostationary orbits,
572.72	and we cannot keep
572.72	launching new satellites
575.08	to replace the ones that have broken down
577.4	without doing something about them first,
579.48	just like we would never
579.48	leave a broken down car
581.96	in the middle of the highway.
583.76	Next time you use your phone,
585.36	check the weather or use your GPS,
587.88	think about the satellite technologies
587.88	that make those activities possible.
592.16	But also think about the very impact
594.04	that the satellites have
594.04	on the environment surrounding Earth,
597.36	and help spread the message
597.36	that together we must reduce our impact.
602.08	Earth orbit is breathtakingly beautiful
604.64	and our gateway to exploration.
607.24	It's up to us to keep it that way.
611.16	Thank you.
612.4	(Applause)
