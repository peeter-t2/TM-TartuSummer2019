12.806	I was excited to be a part
12.806	"of the ""Dream"" theme,"
17.01	and then I found out I'm leading off
17.01	"the ""Nightmare?"" section of it."
20.413	(Laughter)
23.972	And certainly there are things
23.972	about the climate crisis that qualify.
28.462	And I have some bad news,
30.749	but I have a lot more good news.
32.939	I'm going to propose three questions
36.36	and the answer to the first one
39.124	necessarily involves a little bad news.
41.515	But -- hang on, because the answers
41.515	to the second and third questions
46.948	really are very positive.
49.085	So the first question is,
49.085	"""Do we really have to change?"""
54.106	And of course, the Apollo Mission,
54.106	among other things
59.255	changed the environmental movement,
61.6	really launched the modern
61.6	environmental movement.
	was first seen on earth,
68.937	the first Earth Day was organized.
71.561	And we learned a lot about ourselves
74.324	looking back at our planet from space.
77.238	And one of the things that we learned
79.055	confirmed what the scientists
79.055	have long told us.
81.522	One of the most essential facts
83.588	about the climate crisis
83.588	has to do with the sky.
86.432	As this picture illustrates,
88.232	the sky is not the vast
88.232	and limitless expanse
91.297	that appears when we look up
91.297	from the ground.
94.153	It is a very thin shell of atmosphere
98.03	surrounding the planet.
100.449	That right now is the open sewer
100.449	for our industrial civilization
105.669	as it's currently organized.
107.573	We are spewing 110 million tons
111.219	of heat-trapping global warming pollution
111.219	into it every 24 hours,
116.211	free of charge, go ahead.
118.533	And there are many sources
118.533	of the greenhouse gases,
121.052	I'm certainly not going
121.052	to go through them all.
123.316	I'm going to focus on the main one,
125.034	but agriculture is involved,
125.034	diet is involved, population is involved.
129.446	Management of forests, transportation,
131.953	the oceans, the melting of the permafrost.
134.458	But I'm going to focus
134.458	on the heart of the problem,
136.888	which is the fact that we still rely
136.888	on dirty, carbon-based fuels
141.427	for 85 percent of all the energy
141.427	that our world burns every year.
147.89	And you can see from this image
147.89	that after World War II,
151.59	the emission rates
151.59	started really accelerating.
154.522	And the accumulated amount
154.522	of man-made, global warming pollution
157.875	that is up in the atmosphere now
159.425	traps as much extra heat energy
159.425	as would be released
163.183	by 400,000 Hiroshima-class
163.183	atomic bombs exploding
168.656	every 24 hours, 365 days a year.
172.494	Fact-checked over and over again,
174.336	conservative, it's the truth.
176.557	Now it's a big planet, but --
179.131	(Explosion sound)
181.156	that is a lot of energy,
182.803	particularly when you multiply it
188.881	And all that extra heat energy
190.414	is heating up the atmosphere,
190.414	the whole earth system.
193.414	Let's look at the atmosphere.
195.388	This is a depiction
196.702	of what we used to think of as
196.702	the normal distribution of temperatures.
202.191	The white represents
202.191	normal temperature days;
208.367	The blue are cooler than average days,
210.271	the red are warmer than average days.
212.546	But the entire curve has moved
212.546	to the right in the 1980s.
216.728	And you'll see
216.728	in the lower right-hand corner
218.903	the appearance of statistically
218.903	significant numbers
221.37	of extremely hot days.
222.972	In the 90s, the curve shifted further.
224.969	And in the last 10 years,
224.969	you see the extremely hot days
228.684	are now more numerous
228.684	than the cooler than average days.
232.375	In fact, they are 150 times more common
232.375	on the surface of the earth
237.855	than they were just 30 years ago.
241.713	So we're having
241.713	record-breaking temperatures.
244.807	Fourteen of the 15 of the hottest years
244.807	ever measured with instruments
248.154	have been in this young century.
249.717	The hottest of all was last year.
252.274	Last month was the 371st month in a row
255.795	warmer than the 20th-century average.
257.986	And for the first time,
257.986	not only the warmest January,
261.19	but for the first time, it was more
261.19	than two degrees Fahrenheit warmer
266.275	than the average.
268.381	These higher temperatures
268.381	are having an effect on animals,
272.309	plants, people, ecosystems.
275.396	But on a global basis, 93 percent
275.396	of all the extra heat energy
280.342	is trapped in the oceans.
282.116	And the scientists can measure
282.116	the heat buildup
284.347	much more precisely now
285.64	at all depths: deep, mid-ocean,
287.895	the first few hundred meters.
289.959	And this, too, is accelerating.
292.578	It goes back more than a century.
294.231	And more than half of the increase
294.231	has been in the last 19 years.
298.642	This has consequences.
299.989	The first order of consequence:
301.556	the ocean-based storms get stronger.
303.534	Super Typhoon Haiyan
303.534	went over areas of the Pacific
306.01	five and a half degrees Fahrenheit
306.01	warmer than normal
309.353	before it slammed into Tacloban,
311.87	as the most destructive storm
311.87	ever to make landfall.
315.917	Pope Francis, who has made
315.917	such a difference to this whole issue,
320.561	visited Tacloban right after that.
322.89	Superstorm Sandy went over
322.89	areas of the Atlantic
325.493	nine degrees warmer than normal
327.875	before slamming into
327.875	New York and New Jersey.
331.954	The second order of consequences
331.954	are affecting all of us right now.
335.146	The warmer oceans are evaporating
335.146	much more water vapor into the skies.
340.901	Average humidity worldwide
340.901	has gone up four percent.
344.755	And it creates these atmospheric rivers.
347.472	The Brazilian scientists
347.472	"call them ""flying rivers."""
350.514	And they funnel all of that
350.514	extra water vapor over the land
355.281	where storm conditions trigger
355.281	these massive record-breaking downpours.
360.567	This is from Montana.
363.331	Take a look at this storm last August.
365.678	As it moves over Tucson, Arizona.
368.021	It literally splashes off the city.
371.829	These downpours are really unusual.
375.056	Last July in Houston, Texas,
378.231	it rained for two days,
381.209	That represents more than two days
381.209	of the full flow of Niagara Falls
385.296	in the middle of the city,
386.565	which was, of course, paralyzed.
388.492	These record downpours are creating
388.492	historic floods and mudslides.
392.864	This one is from Chile last year.
397.175	And you'll see that warehouse going by.
400.342	There are oil tankers cars going by.
402.97	This is from Spain last September,
404.93	you could call this the running
404.93	of the cars and trucks, I guess.
409.865	Every night on the TV news now
409.865	is like a nature hike
412.717	through the Book of Revelation.
414.575	(Laughter)
416.99	I mean, really.
419.056	The insurance industry
419.056	has certainly noticed,
421.726	the losses have been mounting up.
423.97	They're not under any illusions
423.97	about what's happening.
427.972	And the causality requires
427.972	a moment of discussion.
433.266	We're used to thinking of linear cause
433.266	and linear effect --
436.604	one cause, one effect.
437.779	This is systemic causation.
441.009	As the great Kevin Trenberth says,
443.272	"""All storms are different now."
444.756	There's so much extra energy
444.756	in the atmosphere,
447.019	there's so much extra water vapor.
448.708	"Every storm is different now."""
451.725	So, the same extra heat pulls
451.725	the soil moisture out of the ground
456.09	and causes these deeper, longer,
456.09	more pervasive droughts
460.524	and many of them are underway right now.
462.638	It dries out the vegetation
464.176	and causes more fires
464.176	in the western part of North America.
467.862	There's certainly been evidence
467.862	of that, a lot of them.
471.345	More lightning,
472.52	as the heat energy builds up,
472.52	there's a considerable amount
475.326	of additional lightning also.
478.71	These climate-related disasters also have
478.71	geopolitical consequences
485.602	and create instability.
487.436	The climate-related historic drought
487.436	that started in Syria in 2006
492.736	destroyed 60 percent
492.736	of the farms in Syria,
495.712	killed 80 percent of the livestock,
498.077	and drove 1.5 million climate refugees
498.077	into the cities of Syria,
502.32	where they collided with another
502.32	1.5 million refugees
505.573	from the Iraq War.
507.985	And along with other factors,
507.985	that opened the gates of Hell
512.234	that people are trying to close now.
515.438	The US Defense Department has long warned
517.876	of consequences from the climate crisis,
520.198	including refugees,
520.198	food and water shortages
524.749	and pandemic disease.
526.653	Right now we're seeing microbial diseases
526.653	from the tropics spread
531.406	to the higher latitudes;
532.69	the transportation revolution has had
532.69	a lot to do with this.
536.332	But the changing conditions
536.332	change the latitudes and the areas
540.021	where these microbial diseases
540.021	can become endemic
543.878	and change the range of the vectors,
543.878	like mosquitoes and ticks that carry them.
548.641	The Zika epidemic now --
552.133	we're better positioned in North America
554.074	because it's still a little too cool
554.074	and we have a better public health system.
558.788	But when women in some regions
558.788	of South and Central America
563.112	are advised not to get pregnant
563.112	for two years --
565.847	that's something new,
565.847	that ought to get our attention.
569.961	The Lancet, one of the two greatest
569.961	medical journals in the world,
573.133	last summer labeled this
573.133	a medical emergency now.
577.387	And there are many factors because of it.
580.073	This is also connected
580.073	to the extinction crisis.
582.894	We're in danger of losing 50 percent
582.894	of all the living species on earth
586.465	by the end of this century.
587.812	And already, land-based plants and animals
590.598	are now moving towards the poles
592.27	at an average rate of 15 feet per day.
596.661	Speaking of the North Pole,
597.995	last December 29, the same storm
597.995	that caused historic flooding
603.289	in the American Midwest,
604.962	raised temperatures at the North Pole
609.823	causing the thawing of the North Pole
612.285	in the middle of the long,
612.285	dark, winter, polar night.
616.921	And when the land-based ice
616.921	of the Arctic melts,
620.527	it raises sea level.
622.269	Paul Nicklen's beautiful photograph
622.269	from Svalbard illustrates this.
626.474	It's more dangerous coming off Greenland
628.458	and particularly, Antarctica.
630.488	The 10 largest risk cities
630.488	for sea-level rise by population
635.202	are mostly in South and Southeast Asia.
637.965	When you measure it by assets at risk,
637.965	number one is Miami:
642.098	three and a half trillion dollars at risk.
644.745	Number three: New York and Newark.
646.44	I was in Miami last fall
646.44	during the supermoon,
649.76	one of the highest high-tide days.
652.895	And there were fish from the ocean
652.895	swimming in some of the streets
656.051	of Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale
658.226	and Del Rey.
659.424	And this happens regularly
659.424	during the highest-tide tides now.
662.422	Not with rain -- they call it
662.422	"""sunny-day flooding."""
665.061	It comes up through the storm sewers.
669.636	And the Mayor of Miami
669.636	speaks for many when he says
674.024	it is long past time this can be viewed
674.024	through a partisan lens.
678.271	This is a crisis
678.271	that's getting worse day by day.
681.431	We have to move beyond partisanship.
683.776	And I want to take a moment
683.776	to honor these House Republicans --
687.062	(Applause)
688.14	who had the courage last fall
690.997	to step out and take a political risk,
695.455	by telling the truth
695.455	about the climate crisis.
698.218	So the cost of the climate
698.218	crisis is mounting up,
701.399	there are many of these aspects
701.399	I haven't even mentioned.
705.091	It's an enormous burden.
707.088	I'll mention just one more,
708.676	because the World Economic Forum
708.676	last month in Davos,
713.427	after their annual survey
713.427	of 750 economists,
716.468	said the climate crisis is now
716.468	the number one risk
719.352	to the global economy.
721.205	So you get central bankers
722.547	like Mark Carney, the head
722.547	of the UK Central Bank,
725.341	saying the vast majority
725.341	of the carbon reserves are unburnable.
729.401	Subprime carbon.
731.171	I'm not going to remind you what happened
731.171	with subprime mortgages,
734.486	but it's the same thing.
736.112	If you look at all of the carbon fuels
736.112	that were burned
738.851	since the beginning
738.851	of the industrial revolution,
741.545	this is the quantity burned
741.545	in the last 16 years.
745.085	Here are all the ones that are proven
745.085	and left on the books,
750.5	The International Energy Agency
750.5	says only this amount can be burned.
754.733	So the rest, 22 trillion dollars --
757.646	unburnable.
759.303	Risk to the global economy.
761.56	That's why divestment movement
761.56	makes practical sense
764.621	and is not just a moral imperative.
767.225	So the answer to the first question,
767.225	"""Must we change?"""
771.419	is yes, we have to change.
773.367	"Second question, ""Can we change?"""
775.143	This is the exciting news!
777.488	The best projections
777.488	in the world 16 years ago
781.017	were that by 2010, the world
781.017	would be able to install
787.263	We beat that mark
787.263	by 14 and a half times over.
792.278	We see an exponential curve
792.278	for wind installations now.
796.086	We see the cost coming down dramatically.
799.685	Some countries -- take Germany,
799.685	an industrial powerhouse
802.959	with a climate not that different
802.959	from Vancouver's, by the way --
806.351	one day last December,
808.01	got 81 percent of all its energy
808.01	from renewable resources,
811.472	mainly solar and wind.
813.129	A lot of countries are getting
813.129	more than half on an average basis.
816.454	More good news:
817.636	energy storage,
817.636	from batteries particularly,
820.683	is now beginning to take off
822.301	because the cost has been
822.301	coming down very dramatically
826.118	to solve the intermittency problem.
827.915	With solar, the news is even
827.915	more exciting!
830.45	The best projections 14 years ago
830.45	were that we would install
833.823	one gigawatt per year by 2010.
836.394	When 2010 came around,
836.394	we beat that mark by 17 times over.
841.038	Last year, we beat it by 58 times over.
844.647	This year, we're on track
844.647	to beat it 68 times over.
847.911	We're going to win this.
849.125	We are going to prevail.
850.883	The exponential curve on solar
850.883	is even steeper and more dramatic.
854.99	When I came to this stage 10 years ago,
856.943	this is where it was.
858.894	We have seen a revolutionary breakthrough
862.472	in the emergence
862.472	of these exponential curves.
865.685	(Applause)
868.933	And the cost has come down
872.454	for 30 years.
873.777	And it's continuing to come down.
876.099	Now, the business community
876.099	has certainly noticed this,
878.769	because it's crossing
878.769	the grid parity point.
881.602	Cheaper solar penetration rates
881.602	are beginning to rise.
884.878	Grid parity is understood
884.878	as that line, that threshold,
888.418	below which renewable electricity
888.418	is cheaper than electricity
892.316	from burning fossil fuels.
894.558	That threshold is a little bit
894.558	like the difference
897.275	between 32 degrees Fahrenheit
897.275	and 33 degrees Fahrenheit,
901.409	or zero and one Celsius.
903.019	It's a difference of more than one degree,
905.067	it's the difference between ice and water.
907.792	And it's the difference between markets
907.792	that are frozen up,
911.76	and liquid flows of capital
911.76	into new opportunities for investment.
916.316	This is the biggest
916.316	new business opportunity
919.945	in the history of the world,
921.501	and two-thirds of it
921.501	is in the private sector.
924.673	We are seeing an explosion
924.673	of new investment.
928.133	Starting in 2010, investments globally
928.133	in renewable electricity generation
933.725	surpassed fossils.
935.282	The gap has been growing ever since.
937.722	The projections for the future
937.722	are even more dramatic,
940.694	even though fossil energy
940.694	is now still subsidized
944.317	at a rate 40 times larger than renewables.
947.568	And by the way, if you add
947.568	the projections for nuclear on here,
951.682	particularly if you assume
951.682	that the work many are doing
954.327	to try to break through to safer
954.327	and more acceptable,
957.065	more affordable forms of nuclear,
958.928	this could change even more dramatically.
961.934	So is there any precedent
961.934	for such a rapid adoption
964.914	of a new technology?
966.667	Well, there are many,
966.667	but let's look at cell phones.
969.151	In 1980, AT&amp;T, then Ma Bell,
972.548	commissioned McKinsey to do
972.548	a global market survey
974.965	of those clunky new mobile phones
974.965	that appeared then.
978.605	"""How many can we sell"
978.605	"by the year 2000?"" they asked."
981.792	"McKinsey came back and said, ""900,000."""
984.384	And sure enough,
984.384	when the year 2000 arrived,
986.48	they did sell 900,000 --
986.48	in the first three days.
989.082	And for the balance of the year,
989.082	they sold 120 times more.
993.018	And now there are more cell connections
993.018	than there are people in the world.
997.418	So, why were they not only wrong,
997.418	but way wrong?
1001.911	"I've asked that question myself, ""Why?"""
1004.335	(Laughter)
1005.362	And I think the answer is in three parts.
1008.122	First, the cost came down much faster
1008.122	than anybody expected,
1011.535	even as the quality went up.
1014.066	And low-income countries, places
1014.066	that did not have a landline grid --
1018.362	they leap-frogged to the new technology.
1020.614	The big expansion has been
1020.614	in the developing counties.
1023.702	So what about the electricity grids
1023.702	in the developing world?
1027.474	Well, not so hot.
1029.228	And in many areas, they don't exist.
1031.55	There are more people
1031.55	without any electricity at all in India
1034.72	than the entire population
1034.72	of the United States of America.
1037.866	So now we're getting this:
1039.394	solar panels on grass huts
1041.256	and new business models
1041.256	that make it affordable.
1044.218	Muhammad Yunus financed
1044.218	this one in Bangladesh with micro-credit.
1049.127	This is a village market.
1050.859	Bangladesh is now the fastest-deploying
1050.859	country in the world:
1053.773	two systems per minute
1053.773	on average, night and day.
1056.209	And we have all we need:
1057.422	enough energy from the Sun
1057.422	comes to the earth
1059.738	every hour to supply the full world's
1059.738	energy needs for an entire year.
1065.125	It's actually a little bit
1065.125	less than an hour.
1067.322	So the answer to the second question,
1067.322	"""Can we change?"""
1070.678	"is clearly ""Yes."""
1072.625	"And it's an ever-firmer ""yes."""
1075.421	"Last question, ""Will we change?"""
1078.053	Paris really was a breakthrough,
1080.069	some of the provisions are binding
1081.756	and the regular reviews will matter a lot.
1083.818	But nations aren't waiting,
1083.818	they're going ahead.
1086.093	China has already announced
1086.093	that starting next year,
1088.632	they're adopting a nationwide
1088.632	cap and trade system.
1091.639	They will likely link up
1091.639	with the European Union.
1094.806	The United States
1094.806	has already been changing.
1097.322	All of these coal plants were proposed
1099.396	in the next 10 years and canceled.
1101.95	All of these existing
1101.95	coal plants were retired.
1104.893	All of these coal plants have had
1104.893	their retirement announced.
1107.934	All of them -- canceled.
1110.286	We are moving forward.
1111.8	Last year -- if you look at
1111.8	all of the investment
1114.292	in new electricity generation
1114.292	in the United States,
1117.259	almost three-quarters
1117.259	was from renewable energy,
1119.949	mostly wind and solar.
1122.485	We are solving this crisis.
1125.656	The only question is:
1125.656	how long will it take to get there?
1130.579	So, it matters that a lot
1130.579	of people are organizing
1135.22	to insist on this change.
1137.382	Almost 400,000 people
1137.382	marched in New York City
1141.19	before the UN special session on this.
1144.061	Many thousands, tens of thousands,
1146.089	marched in cities around the world.
1148.986	And so, I am extremely optimistic.
1153.153	As I said before,
1153.153	we are going to win this.
1155.732	I'll finish with this story.
1158.218	When I was 13 years old,
1160.834	I heard that proposal by President Kennedy
1164.289	to land a person on the Moon
1164.289	and bring him back safely
1166.864	in 10 years.
1168.053	And I heard adults
1168.053	of that day and time say,
1171.061	"""That's reckless, expensive,"
1171.061	"may well fail."""
1174.602	But eight years and two months later,
1176.803	in the moment that Neil Armstrong
1176.803	set foot on the Moon,
1180.089	there was great cheer that went up
1180.089	in NASA's mission control in Houston.
1184.703	Here's a little-known fact about that:
1187.187	the average age of the systems engineers,
1189.416	the controllers in the room
1189.416	that day, was 26,
1192.616	which means, among other things,
1194.199	their age, when they heard
1194.199	that challenge, was 18.
1197.473	We now have a moral challenge
1200.699	that is in the tradition of others
1200.699	that we have faced.
1204.253	One of the greatest poets
1204.253	of the last century in the US,
1207.931	Wallace Stevens,
1209.304	wrote a line that has stayed with me:
1211.146	"""After the final 'no,'"
1211.146	there comes a 'yes,'
1213.653	and on that 'yes',
1213.653	"the future world depends."""
1216.658	When the abolitionists
1216.658	started their movement,
1218.967	they met with no after no after no.
1221.198	And then came a yes.
1222.498	The Women's Suffrage
1222.498	and Women's Rights Movement
1224.911	met endless no's, until finally,
1224.911	there was a yes.
1228.53	The Civil Rights Movement,
1228.53	the movement against apartheid,
1231.325	and more recently, the movement
1231.325	for gay and lesbian rights
1234.94	here in the United States and elsewhere.
1237.369	"After the final ""no"" comes a ""yes."""
1239.569	When any great moral challenge
1239.569	is ultimately resolved
1244.726	into a binary choice
1244.726	between what is right and what is wrong,
1248.605	the outcome is fore-ordained
1248.605	because of who we are as human beings.
1252.758	Ninety-nine percent of us,
1252.758	that is where we are now
1256.635	and it is why we're going to win this.
1259.151	We have everything we need.
1261.113	Some still doubt that we have
1261.113	the will to act,
1264.552	but I say the will to act is itself
1264.552	a renewable resource.
1269.266	Thank you very much.
1270.497	(Applause)
1307.319	Chris Anderson: You've got this incredible
1307.319	combination of skills.
1310.526	You've got this scientist mind
1310.526	that can understand
1313.511	the full range of issues,
1315.836	and the ability to turn it
1315.836	into the most vivid language.
1319.512	No one else can do that,
1319.512	that's why you led this thing.
1322.419	It was amazing to see it 10 years ago,
1322.419	it was amazing to see it now.
1325.854	Al Gore: Well, you're nice
1325.854	to say that, Chris.
1328.053	But honestly, I have a lot
1328.053	of really good friends
1331.238	in the scientific community
1331.238	who are incredibly patient
1334.981	and who will sit there
1334.981	and explain this stuff to me
1337.776	over and over and over again
1339.134	until I can get it
1339.134	into simple enough language
1342.754	that I can understand it.
1343.99	And that's the key to trying
1343.99	to communicate.
1347.497	CA: So, your talk. First part: terrifying,
1351.206	second part: incredibly hopeful.
1353.81	How do we know that all those graphs,
1353.81	all that progress, is enough
1359.135	to solve what you showed
1359.135	in the first part?
1361.887	AG: I think that the crossing --
1365.439	you know, I've only been
1365.439	in the business world for 15 years.
1368.476	But one of the things I've learned
1368.476	is that apparently it matters
1371.778	if a new product or service
1371.778	is more expensive
1374.966	than the incumbent, or cheaper than.
1377.144	Turns out, it makes a difference
1377.144	if it's cheaper than.
1379.723	(Laughter)
1380.842	And when it crosses that line,
1383.56	then a lot of things really change.
1385.48	We are regularly surprised
1385.48	by these developments.
1388.449	The late Rudi Dornbusch,
1388.449	the great economist said,
1391.02	"""Things take longer to happen"
1391.02	then you think they will,
1393.84	and then they happen much faster
1393.84	"than you thought they could."""
1396.822	I really think that's where we are.
1398.544	Some people are using the phrase
1398.544	"""The Solar Singularity"" now,"
1402.245	meaning when it gets
1402.245	below the grid parity,
1405.562	unsubsidized in most places,
1407.634	then it's the default choice.
1409.3	Now, in one of the presentations
1409.3	yesterday, the jitney thing,
1415.314	there is an effort to use
1415.314	regulations to slow this down.
1420.445	And I just don't think it's going to work.
1424.608	There's a woman in Atlanta, Debbie Dooley,
1427.028	who's the Chairman
1427.028	of the Atlanta Tea Party.
1429.133	They enlisted her
1429.133	in this effort to put a tax
1431.334	on solar panels and regulations.
1433.481	And she had just put
1433.481	solar panels on her roof
1435.624	and she didn't understand the request.
1437.514	(Laughter)
1439.303	And so she went and formed
1439.303	an alliance with the Sierra Club
1442.805	and they formed a new organization
1442.805	called the Green Tea Party.
1446.882	(Laughter)
1447.908	(Applause)
1448.933	And they defeated the proposal.
1450.445	So, finally, the answer
1450.445	to your question is,
1453.695	this sounds a little corny
1453.695	and maybe it's a cliché,
1456.752	but 10 years ago -- and Christiana
1456.752	referred to this --
1460.292	there are people in this audience
1460.292	who played an incredibly significant role
1466.223	in generating those exponential curves.
1469.048	And it didn't work out economically
1469.048	for some of them,
1471.596	but it kick-started
1471.596	this global revolution.
1474.674	And what people in this audience do now
1478.477	with the knowledge
1478.477	that we are going to win this.
1481.006	But it matters a lot how fast we win it.
1485.26	CA: Al Gore, that was incredibly powerful.
1487.641	If this turns out to be the year,
1489.34	that the partisan thing changes,
1492.192	as you said, it's no longer
1492.192	a partisan issue,
1495.594	but you bring along people
1495.594	from the other side together,
1499.784	backed by science, backed by these kinds
1499.784	of investment opportunities,
1503.093	backed by reason that you win the day --
1505.225	boy, that's really exciting.
1507.608	Thank you so much.
1508.8	AG: Thank you so much
1508.8	for bringing me back to TED.
1511.331	Thank you!
1512.506	(Applause)
