12.58	Paying close attention to something:
15.1	Not that easy, is it?
17.34	It's because our attention is pulled
17.34	in so many different directions at a time,
22.38	and it's in fact pretty impressive
22.38	if you can stay focused.
28.18	Many people think that attention
28.18	is all about what we are focusing on,
32.26	but it's also about what information
32.26	our brain is trying to filter out.
38.14	There are two ways
38.14	you direct your attention.
41.42	First, there's overt attention.
43.46	In overt attention,
43.46	you move your eyes towards something
47.62	in order to pay attention to it.
50.18	Then there's covert attention.
52.18	In covert attention,
52.18	you pay attention to something,
56.22	but without moving your eyes.
58.86	Think of driving for a second.
62.78	Your overt attention,
62.78	your direction of the eyes,
65.82	are in front,
67.5	but that's your covert attention
69.3	which is constantly scanning
69.3	the surrounding area,
73.42	where you don't actually look at them.
77.339	I'm a computational neuroscientist,
79.3	and I work on cognitive
79.3	brain-machine interfaces,
82.42	or bringing together
82.42	the brain and the computer.
86.54	I love brain patterns.
88.54	Brain patterns are important for us
90.26	because based on them
90.26	we can build models for the computers,
93.78	and based on these models
95.22	computers can recognize
95.22	how well our brain functions.
99.46	And if it doesn't function well,
101.9	then these computers themselves
101.9	can be used as assistive devices
106.58	for therapies.
108.3	But that also means something,
111.18	because choosing the wrong patterns
113.7	will give us the wrong models
115.62	and therefore the wrong therapies.
117.3	Right?
119.46	In case of attention,
121.14	the fact that we can
123.62	shift our attention not only by our eyes
127.14	but also by thinking --
129.26	that makes covert attention
129.26	an interesting model for computers.
134.1	So I wanted to know
134.1	what are the brainwave patterns
137.58	when you look overtly
137.58	or when you look covertly.
142.26	I set up an experiment for that.
144.78	In this experiment
144.78	there are two flickering squares,
147.54	one of them flickering
147.54	at a slower rate than the other one.
152.42	Depending on which of these flickers
152.42	you are paying attention to,
156.26	certain parts of your brain
156.26	will start resonating in the same rate
161.02	as that flickering rate.
163.82	So by analyzing your brain signals,
166.78	we can track where exactly
166.78	you are watching
170.58	or you are paying attention to.
174.82	So to see what happens in your brain
174.82	when you pay overt attention,
179.06	I asked people to look directly
179.06	in one of the squares
182.34	and pay attention to it.
184.58	In this case, not surprisingly,
184.58	we saw that these flickering squares
189.9	appeared in their brain signals
191.86	which was coming
191.86	from the back of their head,
195.38	which is responsible for the processing
195.38	of your visual information.
200.1	But I was really interested
202.46	to see what happens in your brain
202.46	when you pay covert attention.
206.3	So this time I asked people
206.3	to look in the middle of the screen
210.22	and without moving their eyes,
212.94	to pay attention
212.94	to either of these squares.
216.94	When we did that,
218.58	we saw that both of these flickering rates
218.58	appeared in their brain signals,
222.54	but interestingly,
224.46	only one of them,
224.46	which was paid attention to,
228.02	had stronger signals,
229.7	so there was something in the brain
231.98	which was handling this information
234.54	so that thing in the brain was basically
234.54	the activation of the frontal area.
242.26	The front part of your brain
242.26	is responsible
245.26	for higher cognitive functions as a human.
248.98	The frontal part,
248.98	it seems that it works as a filter
254.46	trying to let information come in
254.46	only from the right flicker
258.86	that you are paying attention to
261.22	and trying to inhibit the information
261.22	coming from the ignored one.
267.22	The filtering ability of the brain
267.22	is indeed a key for attention,
272.54	which is missing in some people,
275.34	for example in people with ADHD.
278.46	So a person with ADHD
278.46	cannot inhibit these distractors,
283.5	and that's why they can't focus
283.5	for a long time on a single task.
289.42	But what if this person
290.98	could play a specific computer game
294.54	with his brain connected to the computer,
298.26	and then train his own brain
301.18	to inhibit these distractors?
305.5	Well, ADHD is just one example.
309.02	We can use these cognitive
309.02	brain-machine interfaces
312.3	for many other cognitive fields.
315.58	It was just a few years ago
317.38	that my grandfather had a stroke,
317.38	and he lost complete ability to speak.
324.46	He could understand everybody,
324.46	but there was no way to respond,
327.82	even not writing
327.82	because he was illiterate.
331.82	So he passed away in silence.
336.62	I remember thinking at that time:
338.98	What if we could have a computer
342.9	which could speak for him?
345.66	Now, after years that I am in this field,
347.9	I can see that this might be possible.
352.06	Imagine if we can find brainwave patterns
354.94	when people think
354.94	about images or even letters,
359.54	like the letter A generates
359.54	a different brainwave pattern
362.5	than the letter B, and so on.
364.78	Could a computer one day
364.78	communicate for people who can't speak?
369.46	What if a computer
371.78	can help us understand
371.78	the thoughts of a person in a coma?
377.66	We are not there yet,
379.3	but pay close attention.
382.06	We will be there soon.
383.78	Thank you.
385.3	(Applause)
