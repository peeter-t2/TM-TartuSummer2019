17.007	My talk today is about something
19.045	maybe a couple of you have already heard about.
21.378	It's called the Arab Spring.
23.712	Anyone heard of it?
25.61	(Applause)
28.735	So in 2011, power shifted,
33.48	from the few to the many,
36.123	from oval offices to central squares,
39.878	from carefully guarded airwaves
42.871	to open-source networks.
45.558	But before Tahrir was a global symbol of liberation,
50.342	there were representative surveys
52.326	already giving people a voice
55.316	in quieter but still powerful ways.
58.809	I study Muslim societies around the world at Gallup.
63.641	Since 2001,
66.125	we've interviewed hundreds of thousands of people --
69.506	young and old, men and women,
71.281	educated and illiterate.
73.421	My talk today draws on this research
76.924	to reveal why Arabs rose up
80.857	and what they want now.
83.874	Now this region's very diverse,
87.056	and every country is unique.
89.041	But those who revolted
90.691	shared a common set of grievances
93.63	and have similar demands today.
96.807	I'm going to focus a lot of my talk on Egypt.
99.658	It has nothing to do with the fact that I was born there, of course.
103.024	But it's the largest Arab country
106.608	and it's also one with a great deal of influence.
110.023	But I'm going to end by widening the lens to the entire region
114.007	to look at the mundane topics
116.824	of Arab views of religion and politics
119.607	and how this impacts women,
122.792	revealing some surprises along the way.
126.564	So after analyzing mounds of data,
130.693	what we discovered was this:
133.161	Unemployment and poverty alone
136.4	did not lead to the Arab revolts of 2011.
140.994	If an act of desperation by a Tunisian fruit vendor
144.077	sparked these revolutions,
145.795	it was the difference between what Arabs experienced
149.795	and what they expected
152.175	that provided the fuel.
154.008	To tell you what I mean,
155.409	consider this trend in Egypt.
157.591	On paper the country was doing great.
160.567	In fact, it attracted accolades
163.424	from multinational organizations
165.876	because of its economic growth.
167.942	But under the surface was a very different reality.
170.591	In 2010, right before the revolution,
174.341	even though GDP per capita
176.492	had been growing at five percent for several years,
179.591	Egyptians had never felt worse about their lives.
184.091	Now this is very unusual,
186.359	because globally we find that, not surprisingly,
189.66	people feel better as their country gets richer.
193.275	And that's because they have better job opportunities
196.058	and their state offers better social services.
199.471	But it was exactly the opposite in Egypt.
201.859	As the country got more well-off,
204.591	unemployment actually rose
207.009	and people's satisfaction
209.659	with things like housing and education plummeted.
215.596	But it wasn't just anger at economic injustice.
219.886	It was also people's deep longing for freedom.
227.26	Contrary to the clash of civilizations theory,
231.526	Arabs didn't despise Western liberty,
235.062	they desired it.
237.014	As early as 2001,
239.763	we asked Arabs, and Muslims in general around the world,
243.236	what they admired most about the West.
246.165	Among the most frequent responses
248.832	was liberty and justice.
251.184	In their own words to an open-ended question
254.35	"we heard, ""Their political system is transparent"
257.266	"and it's following democracy in its true sense."""
260.467	"Another said it was ""liberty and freedom"
262.466	"and being open-minded with each other."""
265.198	Majorities as high as 90 percent and greater
269.833	in Egypt, Indonesia and Iran
272.251	told us in 2005
274.934	that if they were to write a new constitution
279.133	for a theoretical new country
282.499	that they would guarantee freedom of speech
284.824	as a fundamental right,
287.234	especially in Egypt.
289.318	Eighty-eight percent said moving toward greater democracy
293.3	would help Muslims progress --
295.866	the highest percentage of any country we surveyed.
300.083	But pressed up against these democratic aspirations
303.783	was a very different day-to-day experience,
306.884	especially in Egypt.
309.05	While aspiring to democracy the most,
312.568	they were the least likely population in the world
317.315	to say that they had actually voiced their opinion
321.042	to a public official in the last month --
323.416	at only four percent.
327.099	So while economic development made a few people rich,
331.867	it left many more worse off.
334.865	As people felt less and less free,
338.451	they also felt less and less provided for.
342.2	So rather than viewing their former regimes
345.95	as generous if overprotective fathers,
349.384	they viewed them as essentially prison wardens.
353.585	So now that Egyptians have ended Mubarak's 30-year rule,
358.001	they potentially could be
360.168	an example for the region.
362.834	If Egypt is to succeed
364.556	at building a society based on the rule of law,
368.023	it could be a model.
370.875	If, however,
372.2	the core issues that propelled the revolution aren't addressed,
376.624	the consequences could be catastrophic --
380.334	not just for Egypt,
381.568	but for the entire region.
384.84	The signs don't look good, some have said.
388.468	Islamists, not the young liberals that sparked the revolution,
393.301	won the majority in Parliament.
395.9	The military council
397.571	has cracked down on civil society and protests
401.886	and the country's economy continues to suffer.
405.254	Evaluating Egypt on this basis alone, however,
410.019	ignores the real revolution.
414.647	Because Egyptians are more optimistic
416.826	than they have been in years,
419.273	far less divided on religious-secular lines
423.045	than we would think
424.361	and poised for the demands of democracy.
428.276	Whether they support Islamists or liberals,
431.227	Egyptians' priorities for this government are identical,
434.571	and they are jobs, stability and education,
437.327	not moral policing.
439.66	But most of all,
440.728	for the first time in decades,
442.159	they expect to be active participants, not spectators,
445.909	in the affairs of their country.
448.21	I was meeting with a group of newly-elected parliamentarians
452.226	from Egypt and Tunisia
453.761	a couple of weeks ago.
455.293	And what really struck me about them
458.071	was that they weren't only optimistic,
463.26	but they kind of struck me as nervous,
466.102	for lack of a better word.
467.453	One said to me,
468.742	"""Our people used to gather in cafes to watch football"" --"
471.665	or soccer, as we say in America --
474.682	"""and now they gather to watch Parliament."""
479.065	(Laughter)
482.419	"""They're really watching us,"
484.641	and we can't help but worry
488.628	"that we're not going to live up to their expectations."""
491.148	And what really struck me
492.656	is that less than 24 months ago,
494.848	it was the people that were nervous
497.099	about being watched by their government.
500.181	And the reason that they're expecting a lot
503.031	is because they have a new-found hope for the future.
506.635	So right before the revolution
508.421	we said that Egyptians had never felt worse about their lives,
511.898	but not only that, they thought their future would be no better.
516.198	What really changed after the ouster of Mubarak
519.431	wasn't that life got easier.
521.265	It actually got harder.
523.372	But people's expectations for their future
526.465	went up significantly.
528.265	And this hope, this optimism,
530.662	endured a year of turbulent transition.
535.008	One reason that there's this optimism
538.536	is because, contrary to what many people have said,
542.267	most Egyptians think things really have changed in many ways.
546.449	So while Egyptians were known
549.283	for their single-digit turnout
552.75	in elections before the revolution,
555.018	the last election had around 70 percent voter turnout --
558.85	men and women.
560.849	Where scarcely a quarter believed in the honesty of elections in 2010 --
565.763	I'm surprised it was a quarter --
571.556	Now why this matters
573.134	is because we discovered a link
576.3	between people's faith in their democratic process
580.534	and their faith that oppressed people
584.383	can change their situation
586.9	through peaceful means alone.
591.62	(Applause)
600.991	Now I know what some of you are thinking.
603.412	The Egyptian people,
605.045	and many other Arabs who've revolted and are in transition,
608.895	have very high expectations of the government.
612.312	They're just victims of a long-time autocracy,
617.11	expecting a paternal state
619.327	to solve all their problems.
621.706	But this conclusion would ignore
625.295	a tectonic shift taking place in Egypt
628.445	far from the cameras in Tahrir Square.
632.461	And that is Egyptians' elevated expectations
636.127	are placed first on themselves.
639.494	In the country once known for its passive resignation,
643.661	where, as bad as things got,
645.527	only four percent expressed their opinion to a public official,
648.996	today 90 percent tell us
652.308	that if there's a problem in their community,
654.58	it's up to them to fix it.
657.013	(Applause)
664.706	And three-fourths
666.509	believe they not only have the responsibility,
669.34	but the power to make change.
672.31	And this empowerment
674.574	also applies to women,
677.506	whose role in the revolts
679.177	cannot be underestimated.
681.328	They were doctors and dissidents,
683.729	artists and organizers.
685.295	A full third of those who braved tanks and tear gas
690.428	to ask or to demand liberty and justice in Egypt
695.463	were women.
697.136	(Applause)
702.779	Now people have raised some real concerns
705.468	about what the rise of Islamist parties means for women.
709.134	What we've found about the role of religion in law
713.418	and the role of religion in society
715.934	is that there's no female consensus.
718.92	We found that women in one country
723.103	look more like the men in that country
725.07	than their female counterparts across the border.
729.734	Now what this suggests
731.252	is that how women view religion's role in society
735.319	is shaped more by their own country's culture and context
740.6	than one monolithic view
743.115	that religion is simply bad for women.
745.952	Where women agree, however,
749.717	is on their own role,
751.3	and that it must be central and active.
753.833	And here is where we see the greatest gender difference within a country --
758.951	on the issue of women's rights.
761.701	Now how men feel about women's rights
764.301	matters to the future of this region.
767.75	Because we discovered a link
769.784	between men's support for women's employment
773.786	and how many women are actually employed
776.985	in professional fields in that country.
780.169	So the question becomes,
781.633	What drives men's support for women's rights?
785.808	What about men's views of religion and law?
792.557	[Does] a man's opinion
795.442	of the role of religion in politics
798.327	shape their view of women's rights?
801.976	The answer is no.
803.209	We found absolutely no correlation,
806.094	no impact whatsoever,
807.908	between these two variables.
810.443	What drives men's support for women's employment
814.159	is men's employment,
817.043	their level of education
819.542	as well as a high score
822.327	on their country's U.N. Human Development Index.
826.426	What this means
827.617	is that human development,
830.691	not secularization,
832.987	is what's key to women's empowerment
835.707	in the transforming Middle East.
839.391	And the transformation continues.
842.34	From Wall Street to Mohammed Mahmoud Street,
846.223	it has never been more important
848.28	to understand the aspirations
850.624	of ordinary people.
852.742	Thank you.
854.473	(Applause)
