12.81	I'm a tourism entrepreneur
12.81	and a peacebuilder,
15.968	but this is not how I started.
18.824	When I was seven years old,
18.824	I remember watching television
21.889	and seeing people throwing rocks,
24.466	and thinking, this must be
24.466	a fun thing to do.
27.856	So I got out to the street
27.856	and threw rocks,
30.201	not realizing I was supposed
30.201	to throw rocks at Israeli cars.
34.682	Instead, I ended up stoning
34.682	my neighbors' cars. (Laughter)
38.908	They were not enthusiastic
38.908	about my patriotism.
42.81	This is my picture with my brother.
44.904	This is me, the little one,
44.904	and I know what you're thinking:
47.739	"""You used to look cute,"
47.739	"what the heck happened to you?"""
50.68	But my brother, who is older than me,
52.631	was arrested when he was 18,
55.045	taken to prison on charges
55.045	of throwing stones.
57.994	He was beaten up when he refused
57.994	to confess that he threw stones,
61.57	and as a result, had internal injuries
64.171	that caused his death soon after
64.171	he was released from prison.
68.814	I was angry, I was bitter,
72.46	and all I wanted was revenge.
76.152	But that changed when I was 18.
78.659	I decided that I needed
78.659	Hebrew to get a job,
82.096	and going to study Hebrew
82.096	in that classroom
84.603	was the first time I ever met Jews
84.603	who were not soldiers.
90.037	And we connected over really small things,
90.037	like the fact that I love country music,
94.919	which is really strange
94.919	for Palestinians.
98.646	But it was then that I realized also
98.646	that we have a wall of anger,
103.306	of hatred and of ignorance
103.306	that separates us.
108.919	I decided that it doesn't matter
108.919	what happens to me.
113.418	What really matters is how I deal with it.
116.111	And therefore, I decided
116.111	to dedicate my life
119.455	to bringing down the walls
119.455	that separate people.
123.843	I do so through many ways.
125.863	Tourism is one of them,
125.863	but also media and education,
128.963	and you might be wondering,
128.963	really, can tourism change things?
132.657	Can it bring down walls? Yes.
134.367	Tourism is the best sustainable way
134.367	to bring down those walls
139.087	and to create a sustainable way
139.087	of connecting with each other
143.472	and creating friendships.
146.026	In 2009, I cofounded Mejdi Tours,
149.811	a social enterprise that
149.811	aims to connect people,
153.271	with two Jewish friends, by the way,
155.732	and what we'll do, the model we did,
158.031	for example, in Jerusalem,
158.031	we would have two tour guides,
161.537	one Israeli and one Palestinian,
161.537	guiding the trips together,
164.996	telling history and narrative
164.996	and archaeology and conflict
168.201	from totally different perspectives.
171.173	I remember running a trip together
171.173	with a friend named Kobi --
174.531	Jewish congregation from Chicago,
174.531	the trip was in Jerusalem --
177.555	and we took them to a refugee camp,
177.555	a Palestinian refugee camp,
180.717	and there we had this amazing food.
182.817	By the way, this is my mother. She's cool.
185.7	And that's the Palestinian
185.7	food called maqluba.
188.254	"It means ""upside-down."""
189.571	You cook it with rice and chicken,
189.571	and you flip it upside-down.
192.795	It's the best meal ever.
194.436	And we'll eat together.
195.744	Then we had a joint band,
195.744	Israeli and Palestinian musicians,
198.548	and we did some belly-dancing.
200.405	If you don't know any,
200.405	I'll teach you later.
203.795	But when we left, both sides,
206.907	they were crying because
206.907	they did not want to leave.
209.484	Three years later, those
209.484	relationships still exist.
213.106	Imagine with me
213.106	if the one billion people
215.916	who travel internationally 
215.916	every year travel like this,
219.724	not being taken in the bus
219.724	from one side to another,
222.696	from one hotel to another,
225.017	taking pictures from the windows
225.017	of their buses of people and cultures,
228.988	but actually connecting with people.
232.169	You know, I remember having
232.169	a Muslim group from the U.K.
236.093	going to the house
236.093	of an Orthodox Jewish family,
238.879	and having their first Friday night
238.879	dinners, that Sabbath dinner,
243.268	and eating together hamin,
243.268	which is a Jewish food, a stew,
246.843	just having the connection
246.843	of realizing, after a while,
249.722	that a hundred years ago,
249.722	their families came out
252.694	of the same place in Northern Africa.
255.773	This is not a photo profile
255.773	for your Facebook.
258.848	This is not disaster tourism.
260.682	This is the future of travel,
263.05	and I invite you to join me to do that,
263.05	to change your travel.
266.114	We're doing it all over the world now,
268.065	from Ireland to Iran to Turkey,
270.503	and we see ourselves going
270.503	everywhere to change the world.
273.499	Thank you.
274.729	(Applause)
