12.42	In the 1600s, there were so many
12.42	right whales in Cape Cod Bay
16.914	off the east coast of the U.S.
18.741	that apparently you could
18.741	walk across their backs
22.389	from one end of the bay to the other.
25.234	Today, they number in the hundreds,
25.234	and they're endangered.
28.573	Like them, many species of whales
28.573	saw their numbers drastically reduced
33.728	by 200 years of whaling,
36.17	where they were hunted and killed
36.17	for their whale meat, oil and whale bone.
43.009	We only have whales in our waters today
45.412	because of the Save the Whales
45.412	movement of the '70s.
49.057	It was instrumental in stopping
49.057	commercial whaling,
52.455	and was built on the idea that
52.455	if we couldn't save whales,
56.227	what could we save?
58.154	It was ultimately a test
58.154	of our political ability
61.08	to halt environmental destruction.
64.683	So in the early '80s, there was
64.683	a ban on commercial whaling
68.236	that came into force
68.236	as a result of this campaign.
71.951	Whales in our waters are still
71.951	low in numbers, however,
74.76	because they do face a range
74.76	of other human-induced threats.
79.489	Unfortunately, many people still think
79.489	that whale conservationists like myself
87.136	do what we do only because these creatures
87.136	are charismatic and beautiful.
93.939	This is actually a disservice,
96.025	because whales are ecosystem engineers.
100.499	They help maintain the stability
100.499	and health of the oceans,
104.872	and even provide services
104.872	to human society.
109.299	So let's talk about why
109.299	saving whales is critical
113.275	to the resiliency of the oceans.
116.806	It boils down to two main things:
121.334	whale poop and rotting carcasses.
124.546	As whales dive to the depths to feed
124.546	and come up to the surface to breathe,
130.012	they actually release these
130.012	enormous fecal plumes.
133.918	This whale pump, as it's called,
135.662	actually brings essential limiting 
135.662	nutrients from the depths
138.955	to the surface waters where they 
138.955	stimulate the growth of phytoplankton,
142.975	which forms the base
142.975	of all marine food chains.
146.422	So really, having more whales
146.422	in the oceans pooping
149.127	is really beneficial
149.127	to the entire ecosystem.
153.208	Whales are also known to undertake some 
153.208	of the longest migrations of all mammals.
158.76	Gray whales off America
158.76	migrate 16,000 kilometers
164.707	between productive feeding areas and less
164.707	productive calving, or birthing, areas
170.812	and back every year.
173.902	As they do so, they transport fertilizer
173.902	in the form of their feces
178.886	from places that have it
178.886	to places that need it.
182.676	So clearly, whales are really
182.676	important in nutrient cycling,
186.115	both horizontally and vertically,
186.115	through the oceans.
189.807	But what's really cool is that they're 
189.807	also really important after they're dead.
196.466	Whale carcasses are some of 
196.466	the largest form of detritus
200.559	to fall from the ocean's surface, 
200.559	and they're called whale fall.
205.409	As these carcasses sink,
207.466	they provide a feast
207.466	to some 400-odd species,
210.495	including the eel-shaped, slime-producing 
210.495	hagfish.
215.021	So over the 200 years of whaling,
217.154	when we were busy killing and removing
217.154	these carcasses from the oceans,
221.524	we likely altered the rate and geographic 
221.524	distribution of these whale falls
227.246	that would descend into deep oceans,
229.563	and as a result, probably led
229.563	to a number of extinctions
233.254	of species that were most specialized
235.392	and dependent on these carcasses
235.392	for their survival.
239.876	Whale carcasses are also known
239.876	to transport about 190,000 tons of carbon,
247.808	which is the equivalent of that produced
250.106	by 80,000 cars per year
253.171	from the atmosphere to the deep oceans,
256	and the deep oceans
256	"are what we call ""carbon sinks,"""
259.51	because they trap and hold
259.51	excess carbon from the atmosphere,
263.573	and therefore help
263.573	to delay global warming.
267.789	Sometimes these carcasses
267.789	also wash up on beaches
271.468	and provide a meal to a number
271.468	of predatory species on land.
276.54	The 200 years of whaling
276.54	was clearly detrimental
280.464	and caused a reduction
280.464	in the populations of whales
283.356	between 60 to 90 percent.
286.476	Clearly, the Save the Whales movement
288.302	was instrumental in preventing
288.302	commercial whaling from going on,
292.713	but we need to revise this.
295.854	We need to address the more modern,
295.854	pressing problems that these whales face
300.608	in our waters today.
302.349	Amongst other things, we need to stop them
304.482	from getting plowed down by container 
304.482	ships when they're in their feeding areas,
309.187	and stop them from getting
309.187	entangled in fishing nets
311.985	as they float around in the ocean.
314.469	We also need to learn to contextualize
314.469	our conservation messages,
318.839	so people really understand the true 
318.839	ecosystem value of these creatures.
325.985	So, let's save the whales again,
330.142	but this time, let's not just 
330.142	do it for their sake.
334.275	Let's also do it for ours.
336.806	Thank you.
339.151	(Applause)
