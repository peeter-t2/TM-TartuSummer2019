12.607	I had brain surgery 18 years ago,
15.115	and since that time, brain science has become
17.682	a personal passion of mine.
19.681	I'm actually an engineer.
21.916	And first let me say, I recently joined
24.432	Google's Moonshot group,
25.981	where I had a division,
27.193	the display division in Google X,
29.374	and the brain science work I'm speaking about today
31.996	is work I did before I joined Google
34.917	and on the side outside of Google.
37.249	So that said, there's a stigma
40.432	when you have brain surgery.
42.717	Are you still smart or not?
45.54	And if not, can you make yourself smart again?
49.388	After my neurosurgery,
51.154	part of my brain was missing,
53.151	and I had to deal with that.
55.924	It wasn't the grey matter, but it 
55.924	was the gooey part dead center
58.868	that makes key hormones and neurotransmitters.
62.27	Immediately after my surgery,
64.501	I had to decide what amounts of each of over
66.644	a dozen powerful chemicals to take each day,
70.346	because if I just took nothing,
72.155	I would die within hours.
74.887	Every day now for 18 years -- every single day --
78.807	I've had to try to decide the combinations
81.517	and mixtures of chemicals,
82.845	and try to get them, to stay alive.
86.692	There have been several close calls.
89.413	But luckily, I'm an experimentalist at heart,
93.112	so I decided I would experiment
96.339	to try to find more optimal dosages
98.779	because there really isn't a clear road map
100.416	on this that's detailed.
102.319	I began to try different mixtures,
104.47	and I was blown away by how
107.342	tiny changes in dosages
109.753	dramatically changed my sense of self,
112.902	my sense of who I was, my thinking,
114.713	my behavior towards people.
116.972	One particularly dramatic case:
119.021	for a couple months I actually tried dosages
120.889	and chemicals typical of a man in his early 20s,
124.797	and I was blown away by how my thoughts changed.
127.808	(Laughter)
130.928	I was angry all the time,
133.986	I thought about sex constantly,
135.832	and I thought I was the smartest person
138.781	in the entire world, and
140.832	—(Laughter)—
143.095	of course over the years I'd
143.095	met guys kind of like that,
146.02	or maybe kind of toned-down versions of that.
148.287	I was kind of extreme.
150.471	But to me, the surprise was,
153.04	I wasn't trying to be arrogant.
155.206	I was actually trying,
158.415	with a little bit of insecurity,
160.775	to actually fix a problem in front of me,
163.775	and it just didn't come out that way.
165.631	So I couldn't handle it.
167.114	I changed my dosages.
168.639	But that experience, I think, gave me
171.094	a new appreciation for men
172.845	and what they might walk through,
174.661	and I've gotten along with men
176.351	a lot better since then.
178.19	What I was trying to do
179.735	with tuning these hormones
181.763	and neurotransmitters and so forth
184.086	was to try to get my intelligence back
187.691	after my illness and surgery,
190.325	my creative thought, my idea flow.
192.96	And I think mostly in images,
195.601	and so for me that became a key metric --
198.453	how to get these mental images
200.783	that I use as a way of rapid prototyping,
203.287	if you will, my ideas,
205.03	trying on different new ideas for size,
207.402	playing out scenarios.
209.097	This kind of thinking isn't new.
211.01	Philiosophers like Hume and Descartes and Hobbes
214.265	saw things similarly.
215.793	They thought that mental images and ideas
218.53	were actually the same thing.
220.861	There are those today that dispute that,
223.278	and lots of debates about how the mind works,
226.473	but for me it's simple:
228.209	Mental images, for most of us,
230.741	are central in inventive and creative thinking.
234.675	So after several years,
236.45	I tuned myself up and I have lots of great,
239.683	really vivid mental images with a lot of sophistication
242.731	and the analytical backbone behind them.
245	And so now I'm working on,
246.921	how can I get these mental images in my mind
251.083	out to my computer screen faster?
253.933	Can you imagine, if you will,
256.022	a movie director being able to use
258.142	her imagination alone to
258.142	direct the world in front of her?
261.904	Or a musician to get the music out of his head?
265.492	There are incredible possibilities with this
267.784	as a way for creative people
269.777	to share at light speed.
272.01	And the truth is, the remaining bottleneck
274.008	in being able to do this
275.181	is just upping the resolution of brain scan systems.
279.161	So let me show you why I think 
279.161	we're pretty close to getting there
282.029	by sharing with you two recent experiments
284.416	from two top neuroscience groups.
287.003	Both used fMRI technology --
289.491	functional magnetic resonance imaging technology --
291.77	to image the brain,
293.181	and here is a brain scan set from Giorgio Ganis
296.438	and his colleagues at Harvard.
298.388	And the left-hand column shows a brain scan
301.542	of a person looking at an image.
304.809	The middle column shows the brainscan
306.738	of that same individual
308.359	imagining, seeing that same image.
311.425	And the right column was created
313.473	by subtracting the middle 
313.473	column from the left column,
317.083	showing the difference to be nearly zero.
320.026	This was repeated on lots of different individuals
322.92	with lots of different images,
325.75	always with a similar result.
327.354	The difference between seeing an image
329.443	and imagining seeing that same image
331.898	is next to nothing.
334.053	Next let me share with you one other experiment,
336.814	this from Jack Gallant's lab at Cal Berkeley.
341.355	They've been able to decode brainwaves
343.418	into recognizable visual fields.
345.859	So let me set this up for you.
347.164	In this experiment, individuals were shown
349.497	hundreds of hours of YouTube videos
351.492	while scans were made of their brains
353.531	to create a large library of their brain reacting
356.747	to video sequences.
359.396	Then a new movie was shown with new images,
362.246	new people, new animals in it,
364.198	and a new scan set was recorded.
366.909	The computer, using brain scan data alone,
369.697	decoded that new brain scan
371.721	to show what it thought the 
371.721	individual was actually seeing.
376.097	On the right-hand side, you
376.097	see the computer's guess,
379.478	and on the left-hand side, the presented clip.
383.485	This is the jaw-dropper.
385.804	We are so close to being able to do this.
388.491	We just need to up the resolution.
391.276	And now remember that when you see an image
394.528	versus when you imagine that same image,
396.686	it creates the same brain scan.
400.161	So this was done with the highest-resolution
402.883	brain scan systems available today,
405.068	and their resolution has increased really
406.852	about a thousandfold in the last several years.
410.349	Next we need to increase the resolution
412.671	another thousandfold
414.648	to get a deeper glimpse.
416.437	How do we do that?
417.948	There's a lot of techniques in this approach.
420.562	One way is to crack open your
420.562	skull and put in electrodes.
423.68	I'm not for that.
425.083	There's a lot of new imaging techniques
428.038	being proposed, some even by me,
430.041	but given the recent success of MRI,
433	first we need to ask the question,
435.068	is it the end of the road with this technology?
437.909	Conventional wisdom says the only way
440.364	to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets,
442.953	but at this point bigger magnets
444.795	only offer incremental resolution improvements,
448.545	not the thousandfold we need.
450.705	I'm putting forward an idea:
452.528	instead of bigger magnets,
454.491	let's make better magnets.
456.941	There's some new technology breakthroughs
458.944	in nanoscience
460.401	when applied to magnetic structures
462.128	that have created a whole new class of magnets,
465.141	and with these magnets, we can lay down
467.672	very fine detailed magnetic field patterns
469.839	throughout the brain,
471.194	and using those, we can actually create
474.376	holographic-like interference structures
477.214	to get precision control over many patterns,
480.683	as is shown here by shifting things.
483.128	We can create much more complicated structures
486.278	with slightly different arrangements,
488.349	kind of like making Spirograph.
491.382	So why does that matter?
493.61	A lot of effort in MRI over the years
496.187	has gone into making really big,
499.024	really huge magnets, right?
501.634	But yet most of the recent advances
504.143	in resolution have actually come from
506.34	ingeniously clever encoding and decoding solutions
510.348	in the F.M. radio frequency transmitters and receivers
513.635	in the MRI systems.
516.326	Let's also, instead of a uniform magnetic field,
519.648	put down structured magnetic patterns
522.32	in addition to the F.M. radio frequencies.
525.419	So by combining the magnetics patterns
527.726	with the patterns in the F.M. radio frequencies
530.436	processing which can massively increase
532.607	the information that we can extract
534.576	in a single scan.
537.022	And on top of that, we can then layer
539.354	our ever-growing knowledge 
539.354	of brain structure and memory
543.826	to create a thousandfold increase that we need.
547.521	And using fMRI, we should be able to measure
550.464	not just oxygenated blood flow,
552.546	but the hormones and neurotransmitters 
552.546	I've talked about
555.447	and maybe even the direct neural activity,
557.792	which is the dream.
559.295	We're going to be able to dump our ideas
561.529	directly to digital media.
564.223	Could you imagine if we could leapfrog language
566.934	and communicate directly with human thought?
571.143	What would we be capable of then?
574.336	And how will we learn to deal
576.973	with the truths of unfiltered human thought?
581.192	You think the Internet was big.
583.759	These are huge questions.
586.361	It might be irresistible as a tool
588.509	to amplify our thinking and communication skills.
592.385	And indeed, this very same tool
594.408	may prove to lead to the cure
596.534	for Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
599.608	We have little option but to open this door.
603.12	Regardless, pick a year --
604.705	will it happen in five years or 15 years?
606.971	It's hard to imagine it taking much longer.
611.587	We need to learn how to take this step together.
615.282	Thank you.
617.456	(Applause)
