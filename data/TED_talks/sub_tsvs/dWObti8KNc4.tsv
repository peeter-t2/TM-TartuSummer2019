12.28	One of the first patients
12.28	I had to see as a pediatrician was Sol,
17.37	a beautiful month-old baby
20.15	who was admitted with signs
20.15	of a severe respiratory infection.
23.83	Until then, I had never seen
23.83	a patient worsen so fast.
28.81	In just two days
28.81	she was connected to a respirator
31.81	and on the third day she died.
34.55	Sol had whooping cough.
37.3	After discussing the case in the room
37.3	and after a quite distressing catharsis,
42.46	I remember my chief resident said to me,
44.509	"""Okay, take a deep breath. Wash your face."
48.43	And now comes the hardest part:
51.05	"We have to go talk to her parents."""
54.15	At that time, a thousand questions
54.15	came to mind,
58.12	"from, ""How could a one-month-old"
58.12	"baby be so unfortunate?"""
63.2	"to, ""Could we have done"
63.2	"something about it?"""
67.4	Before vaccines existed,
69.68	many infectious diseases
69.68	killed millions of people per year.
75.1	During the 1918 flu pandemic
81.78	That's greater than Argentina's
81.78	current population.
85.06	Perhaps, the older ones among you
85.06	remember the polio epidemic
89.11	that occurred in Argentina in 1956.
92.24	At that time, there was no vaccine
92.24	available against polio.
95.56	People didn't know what to do.
95.56	They were going crazy.
98.09	They would go painting trees
98.09	with caustic lime.
100.37	They'd put little bags of camphor
101.94	in their children's underwear,
101.94	as if that could do something.
106.08	During the polio epidemic,
106.08	thousands of people died.
110.6	And thousands of people were left
110.6	with very significant neurological damage.
116.65	I know this because I read about it,
119.29	because thanks to vaccines,
119.29	my generation was lucky
123.08	to not live through an epidemic
123.08	as terrible as this.
125.89	Vaccines are one of the great successes
125.89	of the 20th century's public health.
131.21	After potable water,
133.23	they are the interventions
133.23	that have most reduced mortality,
136.84	even more than antibiotics.
139.57	Vaccines eradicated terrible diseases
139.57	such as smallpox from the planet
144.59	and succeeded in significantly
144.59	reducing mortality
148.2	due to other diseases such as measles,
150.45	whooping cough, polio and many more.
154.32	All these diseases are considered
154.32	vaccine-preventable diseases.
161.91	What does this mean?
163.67	That they are potentially preventable,
166.69	but in order to be so,
166.69	something must be done.
169.66	You need to get vaccinated.
172.27	I imagine that most,
172.27	if not all of us here today,
175.97	received a vaccine
175.97	at some point in our life.
180.51	Now, I'm not so sure that many of us know
184.96	which vaccines or boosters
184.96	we should receive after adolescence.
190.71	Have you ever wondered
190.71	who we are protecting
194.79	when we vaccinate?
197.07	What do I mean by that?
198.7	Is there any other effect
198.7	beyond protecting ourselves?
205.05	Let me show you something.
207.76	Imagine for a moment
210.22	that we are in a city
212.23	that has never had a case
212.23	of a particular disease,
215.48	such as the measles.
217.43	This would mean that no one in the city
217.43	has ever had contact with the disease.
222.29	No one has natural defenses against,
222.29	nor been vaccinated against measles.
227.68	If one day, a person sick with the measles
227.68	appears in this city
233	the disease won't find much resistance
236.51	and will begin spreading
236.51	from person to person,
239.44	and in no time it will disseminate
239.44	throughout the community.
243.81	After a certain time
245.53	a big part of the population will be ill.
249.75	This happened when there were no vaccines.
254.63	Now, imagine the complete opposite case.
259.42	We are in a city
261.83	where more than 90 percent
261.83	of the population
264.65	has defenses against
264.65	the measles, which means
267.1	that they either had the disease,
267.1	survived, and developed natural defenses;
270.839	or that they had been
270.839	immunized against measles.
275.2	If one day,
276.81	a person sick with the measles
276.81	appears in this city,
281.23	the disease will find much more resistance
284.61	and won't be transmitted
284.61	that much from person to person.
288.78	The spread will probably remain contained
292.75	and a measles outbreak won't happen.
297.06	I would like you
297.06	to pay attention to something.
300.81	People who are vaccinated
303.49	are not only protecting themselves,
306.29	but by blocking the dissemination
306.29	of the disease
309.9	within the community,
311.54	they are indirectly protecting
311.54	the people in this community
316.22	who are not vaccinated.
318.69	They create a kind of protective shield
321.66	which prevents them from
321.66	coming in contact with the disease,
324.76	so that these people are protected.
328.67	This indirect protection
331.87	that the unvaccinated people
331.87	within a community receive
335.37	simply by being surrounded
335.37	by vaccinated people,
339.95	is called herd immunity.
345.13	Many people in the community
347.59	depend almost exclusively
347.59	on this herd immunity
351.09	to be protected against disease.
354.76	The unvaccinated people you see
354.76	in infographics are not just hypothetical.
359.26	Those people are our nieces
359.26	and nephews, our children,
362.6	who may be too young
362.6	to receive their first shots.
367.1	They are our parents, our siblings,
369.41	our acquaintances,
370.84	who may have a disease,
372.71	or take medication
372.71	that lowers their defenses.
378.01	There are also people who are
378.01	allergic to a particular vaccine.
383.35	They could even be among us,
385.75	any of us who got vaccinated,
387.61	but the vaccine didn't produce
387.61	the expected effect,
391.41	because not all vaccines
391.41	are always 100 percent effective.
395.6	All these people depend
395.6	almost exclusively on herd immunity
400.8	to be protected against diseases.
404.39	To achieve this effect of herd immunity,
409.2	it is necessary that a large percentage
409.2	of the population be vaccinated.
414.5	This percentage is called the threshold.
417.57	The threshold depends on many variables:
421.33	It depends on the germ's characteristics,
423.74	and those of the immune response
423.74	that the vaccine generates.
428.04	But they all have something in common.
430.43	If the percentage of the population
430.43	in a vaccinated community
435.98	is below this threshold number,
439.05	the disease will begin
439.05	to spread more freely
443.11	and may generate an outbreak
443.11	of this disease within the community.
447.78	Even diseases which were 
447.78	at some point controlled may reappear.
456.55	This is not just a theory.
458.74	This has happened,
458.74	and is still happening.
463.05	In 1998, a British researcher
463.05	published an article
467.75	in one of the most important
467.75	medical journals,
470.53	saying that the MMR vaccine,
473.15	which is given for measles,
473.15	mumps and rubella,
475.88	was associated with autism.
477.75	This generated an immediate impact.
481.01	People began to stop getting vaccinated,
481.01	and stopped vaccinating their children.
485.68	And what happened?
487.3	The number of people vaccinated,
489.98	in many communities around the world,
489.98	fell below this threshold.
493.96	And there were outbreaks of measles
493.96	in many cities in the world --
497.52	in the U.S., in Europe.
499.96	Many people got sick.
502.12	People died of measles.
505.87	What happened?
507.35	This article also generated a huge stir
507.35	within the medical community.
512.02	Dozens of researchers began to assess
512.02	if this was actually true.
517.13	Not only could no one find
520.42	a causal association between MMR
520.42	and autism at the population level,
525.669	but it was also found that this article
525.669	had incorrect claims.
530.82	Even more, it was fraudulent.
534.12	It was fraudulent.
537.12	In fact, the journal publicly retracted
537.12	the article in 2010.
544.88	One of the main concerns and excuses
544.88	for not getting vaccinated
548.78	are the adverse effects.
551.77	Vaccines, like other drugs,
551.77	can have potential adverse effects.
557.97	Most are mild and temporary.
560.48	But the benefits are always greater
560.48	than possible complications.
567.74	When we are ill,
567.74	we want to heal fast.
572.3	Many of us who are here
574.42	take antibiotics
574.42	when we have an infection,
578.09	we take anti-hypertensives
578.09	when we have high blood pressure,
581.27	we take cardiac medications.
583.45	Why? Because we are sick
583.45	and we want to heal fast.
586.7	And we don't question it much.
588.72	Why is it so difficult
588.72	to think of preventing diseases,
593.89	by taking care of ourselves
593.89	when we are healthy?
597.1	We take care of ourselves a lot
597.1	when affected by an illness,
600.29	or in situations of imminent danger.
604.14	I imagine most of us here,
606.81	remember the influenza-A pandemic
610.54	which broke out in 2009
610.54	in Argentina and worldwide.
614.49	When the first cases
614.49	began to come to light,
617.52	we, here in Argentina,
617.52	were entering the winter season.
621.91	We knew absolutely nothing.
624.12	Everything was a mess.
625.53	People wore masks on the street,
625.53	ran into pharmacies to buy alcohol gel.
630.9	People would line up
630.9	in pharmacies to get a vaccine,
634.25	without even knowing
634.25	if it was the right vaccine
636.81	that would protect them
636.81	against this new virus.
639.35	We knew absolutely nothing.
641.65	At that time, in addition to doing
641.65	my fellowship at the Infant Foundation,
646.74	I worked as a home pediatrician
646.74	for a prepaid medicine company.
651.67	I remember that I started
651.67	my shift at 8 a.m.,
654.91	and by 8, I already had a list
654.91	of 50 scheduled visits.
659.06	It was chaos;
659.06	people didn't know what to do.
662.86	I remember the types of patients
662.86	that I was examining.
667.69	The patients were a little older than
667.69	what we were used to seeing in winter,
672.05	with longer fevers.
674.39	And I mentioned that
674.39	to my fellowship mentor,
678.07	and he, for his part, had heard
678.07	the same from a colleague,
681.59	about the large number
681.59	of pregnant women
684.32	and young adults
686.01	being hospitalized in intensive care,
688.25	with hard-to-manage clinical profiles.
692.76	At that time, we set out to understand
692.76	what was happening.
699.3	First thing Monday morning,
699.3	we took the car
702.42	and went to a hospital
702.42	in Buenos Aires Province,
705.35	that served as a referral hospital
705.35	for cases of the new influenza virus.
711.02	We arrived at the hospital;
711.02	it was crowded.
713.55	All health staff were dressed
713.55	in NASA-like bio-safety suits.
717.47	We all had face masks in our pockets.
719.67	I, being a hypochondriac,
719.67	didn't breathe for two hours.
722.4	But we could see what was happening.
725.52	Immediately, we started
725.52	reaching out to pediatricians
729.21	from six hospitals in the city
729.21	and in Buenos Aires Province.
733.44	Our main goal was to find out
736.77	how this new virus behaved
736.77	in contact with our children,
740.66	in the shortest time possible.
743.24	A marathon work.
746.2	In less than three months,
749.07	we could see what effect
749.07	this new H1N1 virus had
755.16	on the 251 children
755.16	hospitalized by this virus.
761.52	We could see which children
761.52	got more seriously ill:
765.5	children under four, especially those
765.5	less than one year old;
769.12	patients with neurological diseases;
771.92	and young children
771.92	with chronic pulmonary diseases.
775.21	Identifying these at-risk groups
775.21	was important
780.02	to include them as priority groups
782.73	in the recommendations
782.73	for getting the influenza vaccine,
785.73	not only here in Argentina,
787.59	but also in other countries
787.59	which the pandemic not yet reached.
792.75	A year later,
794.43	when a vaccine against the pandemic
794.43	H1N1 virus became available,
799.52	we wanted to see what happened.
802.24	After a huge vaccination campaign
805.41	aimed at protecting at-risk groups,
810.18	these hospitals, with 93 percent
810.18	of the at-risk groups vaccinated,
817.14	had not hospitalized a single patient
820.77	for the pandemic H1N1 virus.
823.45	(Applause)
827.92	In 2009: 251.
833.49	In 2010: zero.
836.44	Vaccination is an act
836.44	of individual responsibility,
841.22	but it has a huge collective impact.
846.79	If I get vaccinated,
846.79	not only am I protecting myself,
851.42	but I am also protecting others.
855.52	Sol had whooping cough.
859.5	Sol was very young,
861.7	and she hadn't yet received
861.7	her first vaccine against whooping cough.
867.16	I still wonder what would have happened
870.96	if everyone around Sol
870.96	had been vaccinated.
877.74	(Applause)
