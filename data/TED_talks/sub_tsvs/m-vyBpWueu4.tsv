15.733	There's a group of people in Kenya.
20.341	People cross oceans to go see them.
24.345	These people are tall.
26.379	They jump high. They wear red.
30.886	And they kill lions.
32.998	You might be wondering, who are these people?
36.055	These are the Maasais.
38.649	And you know what's cool? I'm actually one of them.
44.551	The Maasais, the boys are brought up to be warriors.
48.911	The girls are brought up to be mothers.
52.158	When I was five years old,
54.686	I found out that I was engaged
57.254	to be married as soon as I reached puberty.
60.34	My mother, my grandmother, my aunties,
63.326	they constantly reminded me that
65.504	your husband just passed by.
68.224	(Laughter) Cool, yeah?
73.17	And everything I had to do from that moment
76.335	was to prepare me to be a perfect woman at age 12.
80.966	My day started at 5 in the morning,
84.543	milking the cows, sweeping the house,
86.7	cooking for my siblings, collecting water, firewood.
91.239	I did everything that I needed to do
94.481	to become a perfect wife.
98.108	I went to school not because the Maasais'
101.172	women or girls were going to school.
103.813	It's because my mother was denied an education,
106.97	and she constantly reminded me and my siblings that
110.439	she never wanted us to live the life she was living.
114.387	Why did she say that?
116.916	My father worked as a policeman in the city.
120.244	He came home once a year.
121.874	We didn't see him for sometimes even two years.
125.231	And whenever he came home, it was a different case.
129.119	My mother worked hard in the farm
131.124	to grow crops so that we can eat.
132.99	She reared the cows and the goats
135.093	so that she can care for us.
137.108	But when my father came, he would sell the cows,
139.938	he would sell the products we had,
142.321	and he went and drank with his friends in the bars.
146.516	Because my mother was a woman,
147.909	she was not allowed to own any property,
150.91	and by default, everything in my family anyway
153.404	belongs to my father, so he had the right.
156.076	And if my mother ever questioned him,
158.365	he beat her, abused her, and really it was difficult.
165.153	When I went to school, I had a dream.
168.159	I wanted to become a teacher.
170.564	Teachers looked nice.
172.37	They wear nice dresses, high-heeled shoes.
174.623	I found out later that they are uncomfortable, but I admired it.
177.726	(Laughter)
180.981	But most of all, the teacher was just writing on the board --
184.482	not hard work, that's what I thought,
187.556	compared to what I was doing in the farm.
190.436	So I wanted to become a teacher.
192.383	I worked hard in school, but when I was in eighth grade,
196.286	it was a determining factor.
198.69	In our tradition, there is a ceremony
201.263	that girls have to undergo to become women,
204.096	and it's a rite of passage to womanhood.
206.677	And then I was just finishing my eighth grade,
210.245	and that was a transition for me to go to high school.
212.796	This was the crossroad.
214.377	Once I go through this tradition, I was going to become a wife.
219.899	Well, my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass.
224.141	So I talked -- I had to come up with a plan
226.656	to figure these things out.
229.22	I talked to my father. I did something that most girls have never done.
233.356	"I told my father, ""I will only go through this ceremony"
236.556	"if you let me go back to school."""
239.136	The reason why, if I ran away,
241.724	my father will have a stigma, people will be calling him
245.17	the father of that girl who didn't go through the ceremony.
248.211	It was a shameful thing for him to carry the rest of his life.
252.23	"So he figured out. ""Well,"" he said, ""okay,"
255.082	"you'll go to school after the ceremony."""
258.415	I did. The ceremony happened.
261.035	It's a whole week long of excitement.
264.616	It's a ceremony. People are enjoying it.
266.781	And the day before the actual ceremony happens,
269.749	we were dancing, having excitement,
272.237	and through all the night we did not sleep.
276.16	The actual day came, and we walked out of the house
279.49	that we were dancing in. Yes, we danced and danced.
281.644	We walked out to the courtyard, and there were a bunch of people waiting.
285.513	They were all in a circle.
288.124	And as we danced and danced,
289.783	and we approached this circle of women,
292.628	men, women, children, everybody was there.
295.779	There was a woman sitting in the middle of it,
298.347	and this woman was waiting to hold us.
302.885	I was the first. There were my sisters and a couple of other girls,
306.56	and as I approached her,
309.554	she looked at me, and I sat down.
312.273	And I sat down, and I opened my legs.
315.851	As I opened my leg, another woman came,
319.319	and this woman was carrying a knife.
322.675	And as she carried the knife, she walked toward me
326.259	and she held the clitoris, and she cut it off.
330.648	As you can imagine, I bled. I bled.
335.911	After bleeding for a while, I fainted thereafter.
341.009	It's something that so many girls --
343.132	I'm lucky, I never died -- but many die.
347.03	It's practiced, it's no anesthesia, it's a rusty old knife,
353.441	and it was difficult.
356.242	I was lucky because one, also, my mom did something
358.979	that most women don't do.
361.976	Three days later, after everybody has left the home,
364.803	my mom went and brought a nurse.
366.525	We were taken care of.
368.379	Three weeks later, I was healed, and I was back in high school.
372.972	I was so determined to be a teacher now
376.443	so that I could make a difference in my family.
380.443	Well, while I was in high school, something happened.
384.21	I met a young gentleman from our village
386.824	who had been to the University of Oregon.
389.057	This man was wearing a white t-shirt, jeans, camera,
394.933	white sneakers -- and I'm talking about white sneakers.
398.229	There is something about clothes, I think, and shoes.
402.156	They were sneakers, and this is in a village
405.619	that doesn't even have paved roads. It was quite attractive.
409.689	"I told him, ""Well, I want to go to where you are,"""
414.676	because this man looked very happy, and I admired that.
418.924	"And he told me, ""Well,"
421.189	what do you mean, you want to go?
422.323	"Don't you have a husband waiting for you?"""
424.643	"And I told him, ""Don't worry about that part."
427.448	"Just tell me how to get there."""
430.606	This gentleman, he helped me.
433.208	While I was in high school also, my dad was sick.
436.055	He got a stroke, and he was really, really sick,
439.323	so he really couldn't tell me what to do next.
442.643	But the problem is, my father is not the only father I have.
446.334	Everybody who is my dad's age, male in the community,
449.779	is my father by default --
451.423	my uncles, all of them -- and they dictate what my future is.
455.606	So the news came, I applied to school
458.739	and I was accepted to Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia,
462.971	and I couldn't come without the support of the village,
467.411	because I needed to raise money to buy the air ticket.
469.403	I got a scholarship but I needed to get myself here.
472.683	But I needed the support of the village,
475.371	and here again, when the men heard,
478.953	and the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school,
483.03	"they said, ""What a lost opportunity."
485.455	"This should have been given to a boy. We can't do this."""
489.1	So I went back and I had to go back to the tradition.
493.427	There's a belief among our people
495.745	that morning brings good news.
499.115	So I had to come up with something to do with the morning,
501.977	because there's good news in the morning.
504.379	And in the village also, there is one chief, an elder,
508.583	who if he says yes, everybody will follow him.
512.235	So I went to him very early in the morning, as the sun rose.
515.89	The first thing he sees when he opens his door is, it's me.
519.651	"""My child, what are you doing here?"""
522.2	"""Well, Dad, I need help. Can you support me to go to America?"""
526.475	I promised him that I would be the best girl,
528.707	I will come back, anything they wanted after that,
531.941	I will do it for them.
534.1	"He said, ""Well, but I can't do it alone."""
536.194	He gave me a list of another 15 men that I went --
542.278	I went and visited them.
543.862	They all came together.
545.603	The village, the women, the men, everybody came together
548.593	to support me to come to get an education.
551.912	I arrived in America. As you can imagine, what did I find?
556.675	I found snow!
559.884	I found Wal-Marts, vacuum cleaners,
563.042	and lots of food in the cafeteria.
566.118	I was in a land of plenty.
568.771	I enjoyed myself, but during that moment while I was here,
574.536	I discovered a lot of things.
577.168	I learned that that ceremony that I went through
580.209	when I was 13 years old, it was called female genital mutilation.
585.404	I learned that it was against the law in Kenya.
589.078	I learned that I did not have to trade part of my body
593.03	to get an education. I had a right.
597.108	And as we speak right now, three million girls
600.547	in Africa are at risk of going through this mutilation.
605.888	I learned that my mom had a right to own property.
609.063	I learned that she did not have to be abused
611.952	because she is a woman.
614.395	Those things made me angry.
617.482	I wanted to do something.
619.383	As I went back, every time I went,
621.952	I found that my neighbors' girls were getting married.
624.92	They were getting mutilated, and here,
626.994	after I graduated from here, I worked at the U.N.,
630.53	I went back to school to get my graduate work,
633.053	the constant cry of these girls was in my face.
637.163	I had to do something.
639.989	As I went back, I started talking to the men,
642.909	to the village, and mothers, and I said,
644.496	"""I want to give back the way I had promised you"
646.516	"that I would come back and help you. What do you need?"""
649.228	As I spoke to the women, they told me,
651.346	"""You know what we need? We really need a school for girls."""
653.322	Because there had not been any school for girls.
656.078	And the reason they wanted the school for girls
657.891	is because when a girl is raped when she's walking to school,
661.517	the mother is blamed for that.
663.725	If she got pregnant before she got married,
667.137	the mother is blamed for that, and she's punished.
669.506	She's beaten.
671.147	"They said, ""We wanted to put our girls in a safe place."""
674.882	As we moved, and I went to talk to the fathers,
677.525	the fathers, of course, you can imagine what they said:
679.898	"""We want a school for boys."""
682.301	"And I said, ""Well, there are a couple of men from my village"
685.605	who have been out and they have gotten an education.
688.277	Why can't they build a school for boys,
690.349	"and I'll build a school for girls?"""
692.646	That made sense. And they agreed.
695.921	And I told them, I wanted them to show me a sign of commitment.
700.58	And they did. They donated land where we built the girls' school.
705.372	We have.
706.831	I want you to meet one of the girls in that school.
709.963	Angeline came to apply for the school,
712.603	and she did not meet any criteria that we had.
716.203	She's an orphan. Yes, we could have taken her for that.
718.946	But she was older. She was 12 years old,
721.69	and we were taking girls who were in fourth grade.
724.802	Angeline had been moving from one place --
726.597	because she's an orphan, she has no mother, she has no father --
728.938	moving from one grandmother's house to another one,
731.292	from aunties to aunties. She had no stability in her life.
734.926	And I looked at her, I remember that day,
737.514	and I saw something beyond what I was seeing in Angeline.
742.046	And yes, she was older to be in fourth grade.
744.942	We gave her the opportunity to come to the class.
747.912	Five months later, that is Angeline.
751.139	A transformation had begun in her life.
753.905	Angeline wants to be a pilot so she can fly around the world
756.647	and make a difference.
758.38	She was not the top student when we took her.
760.18	Now she's the best student, not just in our school,
762.676	but in the entire division that we are in.
765.825	That's Sharon. That's five years later.
770.146	That's Evelyn. Five months later, that is the difference that we are making.
777.315	As a new dawn is happening in my school,
780.59	a new beginning is happening.
782.849	As we speak right now, 125 girls will never be mutilated.
788.193	One hundred twenty-five girls will not be married when they're 12 years old.
792.889	One hundred twenty-five girls are creating and achieving their dreams.
798.857	This is the thing that we are doing,
801.13	giving them opportunities where they can rise.
804.457	As we speak right now, women are not being beaten
808.112	because of the revolutions we've started in our community.
811.658	(Applause)
819.338	I want to challenge you today.
822.173	You are listening to me because you are here,
825.077	very optimistic.
827.521	You are somebody who is so passionate.
831.035	You are somebody who wants to see a better world.
834.882	You are somebody who wants to see that war ends, no poverty.
839.388	You are somebody who wants to make a difference.
842.137	You are somebody who wants to make our tomorrow better.
845.703	I want to challenge you today that to be the first,
849.481	because people will follow you.
851.978	Be the first. People will follow you.
854.202	Be bold. Stand up. Be fearless. Be confident.
859.485	Move out, because as you change your world,
862.765	as you change your community,
865.204	as we believe that we are impacting one girl, one family,
870.004	one village, one country at a time.
873.324	We are making a difference, so if you change your world,
876.189	you are going to change your community,
878.238	you are going to change your country,
880.03	and think about that. If you do that, and I do that,
882.997	aren't we going to create a better future for our children,
886.597	for your children, for our grandchildren?
888.832	And we will live in a very peaceful world. Thank you very much.
893.037	(Applause)
