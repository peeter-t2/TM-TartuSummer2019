15.76	The global economic financial crisis has reignited public interest
20.26	in something that's actually one of the oldest questions in economics,
23.676	dating back to at least before Adam Smith.
26.36	And that is, why is it that countries with seemingly similar economies and institutions
31.844	can display radically different savings behavior?
35.093	Now, many brilliant economists have spent their entire lives working on this question,
39.627	and as a field we've made a tremendous amount of headway
43.044	and we understand a lot about this.
45.477	What I'm here to talk with you about today is an intriguing new hypothesis
49.111	and some surprisingly powerful new findings that I've been working on
53.143	about the link between the structure of the language you speak
57.864	and how you find yourself with the propensity to save.
62.26	Let me tell you a little bit about savings rates, a little bit about language,
65.327	and then I'll draw that connection.
67.677	Let's start by thinking about the member countries of the OECD,
72.244	or the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development.
75.545	OECD countries, by and large, you should think about these
79.444	as the richest, most industrialized countries in the world.
82.082	And by joining the OECD, they were affirming a common commitment
86.132	to democracy, open markets and free trade.
89.57	Despite all of these similarities, we see huge differences in savings behavior.
94.255	So all the way over on the left of this graph,
96.705	what you see is many OECD countries saving over a quarter of their GDP every year,
101.439	and some OECD countries saving over a third of their GDP per year.
106.12	Holding down the right flank of the OECD, all the way on the other side, is Greece.
110.888	And what you can see is that over the last 25 years,
114.304	Greece has barely managed to save more than 10 percent of their GDP.
118.204	It should be noted, of course, that the United States and the U.K. are the next in line.
125.078	Now that we see these huge differences in savings rates,
127.656	how is it possible that language might have something to do with these differences?
131.322	Let me tell you a little bit about how languages fundamentally differ.
134.371	Linguists and cognitive scientists have been exploring this question for many years now.
139.938	And then I'll draw the connection between these two behaviors.
144.548	Many of you have probably already noticed that I'm Chinese.
147.156	I grew up in the Midwest of the United States.
150.121	And something I realized quite early on
152.572	was that the Chinese language forced me to speak about and --
156.163	in fact, more fundamentally than that --
159.054	ever so slightly forced me to think about family in very different ways.
163.144	Now, how might that be? Let me give you an example.
165.221	Suppose I were talking with you and I was introducing you to my uncle.
169.623	You understood exactly what I just said in English.
172.489	If we were speaking Mandarin Chinese with each other, though,
175.439	I wouldn't have that luxury.
177.505	I wouldn't have been able to convey so little information.
180.338	What my language would have forced me to do,
182.722	"instead of just telling you, ""This is my uncle,"""
184.722	is to tell you a tremendous amount of additional information.
188.004	My language would force me to tell you
189.823	whether or not this was an uncle on my mother's side or my father's side,
193.239	whether this was an uncle by marriage or by birth,
196.323	and if this man was my father's brother,
198.555	whether he was older than or younger than my father.
201.339	All of this information is obligatory. Chinese doesn't let me ignore it.
205.472	And in fact, if I want to speak correctly,
207.638	Chinese forces me to constantly think about it.
210.755	Now, that fascinated me endlessly as a child,
214.704	but what fascinates me even more today as an economist
217.939	is that some of these same differences carry through to how languages speak about time.
223.24	So for example, if I'm speaking in English, I have to speak grammatically differently
227.489	"if I'm talking about past rain, ""It rained yesterday,"""
230.222	"current rain, ""It is raining now,"""
232.454	"or future rain, ""It will rain tomorrow."""
234.888	Notice that English requires a lot more information with respect to the timing of events.
239.715	Why? Because I have to consider that
241.722	"and I have to modify what I'm saying to say, ""It will rain,"" or ""It's going to rain."""
246.505	"It's simply not permissible in English to say, ""It rain tomorrow."""
250.621	In contrast to that, that's almost exactly what you would say in Chinese.
254.805	A Chinese speaker can basically say something
257.121	that sounds very strange to an English speaker's ears.
259.705	"They can say, ""Yesterday it rain,"" ""Now it rain,"" ""Tomorrow it rain."""
264.272	In some deep sense, Chinese doesn't divide up the time spectrum
268.135	in the same way that English forces us to constantly do in order to speak correctly.
274.568	Is this difference in languages
276.152	only between very, very distantly related languages, like English and Chinese?
280.347	Actually, no.
281.305	So many of you know, in this room, that English is a Germanic language.
285.038	What you may not have realized is that English is actually an outlier.
288.953	It is the only Germanic language that requires this.
292.203	For example, most other Germanic language speakers
295.087	feel completely comfortable talking about rain tomorrow
298.104	"by saying, ""Morgen regnet es,"""
300.07	"quite literally to an English ear, ""It rain tomorrow."""
303.97	This led me, as a behavioral economist, to an intriguing hypothesis.
309.037	Could how you speak about time, could how your language forces you to think about time,
313.286	affect your propensity to behave across time?
317.037	You speak English, a futured language.
319.937	And what that means is that every time you discuss the future,
323.104	or any kind of a future event,
324.671	grammatically you're forced to cleave that from the present
328.07	and treat it as if it's something viscerally different.
330.703	Now suppose that that visceral difference
333.203	makes you subtly dissociate the future from the present every time you speak.
337.403	If that's true and it makes the future feel
339.316	like something more distant and more different from the present,
342.299	that's going to make it harder to save.
344.953	If, on the other hand, you speak a futureless language,
347.504	the present and the future, you speak about them identically.
350.887	If that subtly nudges you to feel about them identically,
353.87	that's going to make it easier to save.
356.254	Now this is a fanciful theory.
358.804	I'm a professor, I get paid to have fanciful theories.
361.704	But how would you actually go about testing such a theory?
365.938	Well, what I did with that was to access the linguistics literature.
370.004	And interestingly enough, there are pockets of futureless language speakers
374.387	situated all over the world.
376.32	This is a pocket of futureless language speakers in Northern Europe.
379.686	Interestingly enough, when you start to crank the data,
382.587	these pockets of futureless language speakers all around the world
385.82	turn out to be, by and large, some of the world's best savers.
389.754	Just to give you a hint of that,
391.92	let's look back at that OECD graph that we were talking about.
394.67	What you see is that these bars are systematically taller
398.054	and systematically shifted to the left
400.186	compared to these bars which are the members of the OECD that speak futured languages.
404.704	What is the average difference here?
406.167	Five percentage points of your GDP saved per year.
409.453	Over 25 years that has huge long-run effects on the wealth of your nation.
414.187	Now while these findings are suggestive,
416.887	countries can be different in so many different ways
418.953	that it's very, very difficult sometimes to account for all of these possible differences.
423.337	What I'm going to show you, though, is something that I've been engaging in for a year,
427.369	which is trying to gather all of the largest datasets
429.692	that we have access to as economists,
431.984	and I'm going to try and strip away all of those possible differences,
435.366	hoping to get this relationship to break.
438.02	And just in summary, no matter how far I push this, I can't get it to break.
443.051	Let me show you how far you can do that.
444.816	One way to imagine that is I gather large datasets from around the world.
449.449	So for example, there is the Survey of Health, [Aging] and Retirement in Europe.
453.183	From this dataset you actually learn that retired European families
457.017	are extremely patient with survey takers.
459.65	(Laughter)
461.566	So imagine that you're a retired household in Belgium and someone comes to your front door.
465.95	"""Excuse me, would you mind if I peruse your stock portfolio?"
470.534	Do you happen to know how much your house is worth? Do you mind telling me?
474.066	Would you happen to have a hallway that's more than 10 meters long?
477.333	If you do, would you mind if I timed how long it took you to walk down that hallway?
481.834	Would you mind squeezing as hard as you can, in your dominant hand, this device
485.731	so I can measure your grip strength?
487.243	"How about blowing into this tube so I can measure your lung capacity?"""
491.266	The survey takes over a day.
494.15	(Laughter)
495.633	Combine that with a Demographic and Health Survey
499.533	collected by USAID in developing countries in Africa, for example,
503.983	which that survey actually can go so far as to directly measure the HIV status
509.134	of families living in, for example, rural Nigeria.
512.233	Combine that with a world value survey,
514.134	which measures the political opinions and, fortunately for me, the savings behaviors
518.567	of millions of families in hundreds of countries around the world.
523.266	Take all of that data, combine it, and this map is what you get.
527.084	What you find is nine countries around the world
529.334	that have significant native populations
531.986	which speak both futureless and futured languages.
536.033	And what I'm going to do is form statistical matched pairs
539.567	between families that are nearly identical on every dimension that I can measure,
545.16	and then I'm going to explore whether or not the link between language and savings holds
548.697	even after controlling for all of these levels.
552.18	What are the characteristics we can control for?
554.397	Well I'm going to match families on country of birth and residence,
557.161	the demographics -- what sex, their age --
559.563	their income level within their own country,
561.697	their educational achievement, a lot about their family structure.
564.712	It turns out there are six different ways to be married in Europe.
568.23	And most granularly, I break them down by religion
572.43	where there are 72 categories of religions in the world --
575.745	so an extreme level of granularity.
577.462	There are 1.4 billion different ways that a family can find itself.
581.995	Now effectively everything I'm going to tell you from now on
586.044	is only comparing these basically nearly identical families.
589.094	It's getting as close as possible to the thought experiment
591.594	of finding two families both of whom live in Brussels
594.527	who are identical on every single one of these dimensions,
597.527	but one of whom speaks Flemish and one of whom speaks French;
600.643	or two families that live in a rural district in Nigeria,
603.36	one of whom speaks Hausa and one of whom speaks Igbo.
607.193	Now even after all of this granular level of control,
611.077	do futureless language speakers seem to save more?
614.243	Yes, futureless language speakers, even after this level of control,
617.896	are 30 percent more likely to report having saved in any given year.
621.594	Does this have cumulative effects?
623.41	Yes, by the time they retire, futureless language speakers, holding constant their income,
627.83	are going to retire with 25 percent more in savings.
630.898	Can we push this data even further?
633.379	Yes, because I just told you, we actually collect a lot of health data as economists.
638.678	Now how can we think about health behaviors to think about savings?
642.561	Well, think about smoking, for example.
645.394	Smoking is in some deep sense negative savings.
648.577	If savings is current pain in exchange for future pleasure,
652.243	smoking is just the opposite.
653.551	It's current pleasure in exchange for future pain.
656.41	What we should expect then is the opposite effect.
659.36	And that's exactly what we find.
661.128	Futureless language speakers are 20 to 24 percent less likely
664.895	to be smoking at any given point in time compared to identical families,
668.31	and they're going to be 13 to 17 percent less likely
671.211	to be obese by the time they retire,
673.428	and they're going to report being 21 percent more likely
675.891	to have used a condom in their last sexual encounter.
678.178	I could go on and on with the list of differences that you can find.
681.661	It's almost impossible not to find a savings behavior
685.461	for which this strong effect isn't present.
688.06	My linguistics and economics colleagues at Yale and I are just starting to do this work
692.81	and really explore and understand the ways that these subtle nudges
697.977	cause us to think more or less about the future every single time we speak.
703.372	Ultimately, the goal,
705.673	once we understand how these subtle effects can change our decision making,
709.872	we want to be able to provide people tools
712.822	so that they can consciously make themselves better savers
715.63	and more conscious investors in their own future.
718.889	Thank you very much.
721.156	(Applause)
