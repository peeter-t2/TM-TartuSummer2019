31	William Kamkwamba: Thanks.
32	CA: So, we've got a picture, I think? Where is this?
37	WK: This is my home. This is where I live.
41	CA: Where? What country?
43	WK: In Malawi, Kasungu. In Kasungu. Yeah, Mala.
46	CA: OK. Now, you're 19 now?
49	WK: Yeah. I'm 19 years now.
51	CA: Five years ago you had an idea. What was that?
54	WK: I wanted to make a windmill.
56	CA: A windmill?
57	WK: Yeah.
58	CA: What, to power -- for lighting and stuff?
62	WK: Yeah.
64	CA: So what did you do? How did you realize that?
67	WK: After I dropped out of school, I went to library,
71	"and I read a book that would -- ""Using Energy,"""
75	and I get information about doing the mill.
78	And I tried, and I made it.
80	(Applause)
90	CA: So you copied -- you exactly copied the design in the book.
94	WK: Ah, no. I just --
96	CA: What happened?
98	WK: In fact, a design of the windmill that was in the book,
102	it has got four -- ah -- three blades,
106	and mine has got four blades.
109	CA: The book had three, yours had four.
111	WK: Yeah.
112	CA: And you made it out of what?
114	WK: I made four blades, just because I want to increase power.
119	CA: OK.
120	WK: Yeah.
121	CA: You tested three, and found that four worked better?
123	WK: Yeah. I test.
125	CA: And what did you make the windmill out of?
128	What materials did you use?
130	WK: I use a bicycle frame, and a pulley, and plastic pipe, what then pulls --
136	CA: Do we have a picture of that? Can we have the next slide?
139	WK: Yeah. The windmill.
141	CA: And so, and that windmill, what -- it worked?
145	WK: When the wind blows, it rotates and generates.
150	CA: How much electricity?
151	WK: 12 watts.
153	CA: And so, that lit a light for the house? How many lights?
158	WK: Four bulbs and two radios.
160	CA: Wow.
161	WK: Yeah.
162	(Applause) CA: Next slide --
172	so who's that?
174	WK: This is my parents, holding the radio.
177	CA: So what did they make of -- that you were 14, 15 at the time --
181	what did they make of this? They were impressed?
184	WK: Yeah.
185	CA: And so what's your -- what are you going to do with this?
187	WK: Um --
189	CA: What do you -- I mean -- do you want to build another one?
193	WK: Yeah, I want to build another one --
196	to pump water and irrigation for crops.
201	CA: So this one would have to be bigger?
203	WK: Yeah.
204	CA: How big?
205	WK: I think it will produce more than 20 the watts.
211	CA: So that would produce irrigation for the entire village?
215	WK: Yeah.
217	CA: Wow. And so you're talking to people here at TED
220	to get people who might be able to help in some way
224	to realize this dream?
226	WK: Yeah, if they can help me with materials, yeah.
230	CA: And as you think of your life going forward,
233	you're 19 now,
236	do you picture continuing with this dream of working in energy?
240	WK: Yeah. I'm still thinking to work on energy.
245	CA: Wow. William, it's a real honor to have you at the TED conference.
249	Thank you so much for coming.
251	WK: Thank you.
