12.656	When I was a young officer, they told me
14.626	to follow my instincts,
16.894	to go with my gut,
19.15	and what I've learned
21.16	is that often our instincts are wrong.
25.544	In the summer of 2010,
28.72	there was a massive leak of classified documents
32.059	that came out of the Pentagon.
35.032	It shocked the world,
36.848	it shook up the American government,
38.423	and it made people ask a lot of questions,
40.576	because the sheer amount of information
43.257	that was let out, and the potential impacts,
46.832	were significant.
49.408	And one of the first questions we asked ourselves
53.43	was why would a young soldier have access
56.148	to that much information?
59.08	Why would we let sensitive things
61.606	be with a relatively young person?
65.764	In the summer of 2003, I was assigned to command
68.886	a special operations task force,
71.39	and that task force was spread across the Mideast
73.53	to fight al Qaeda.
75.118	Our main effort was inside Iraq,
78.115	and our specified mission
80.082	was to defeat al Qaeda in Iraq.
81.936	For almost five years I stayed there,
85.04	and we focused on fighting a war
86.85	that was unconventional and it was difficult
91.896	and it was bloody
93.736	and it often claimed its highest price
96.83	among innocent people.
99.904	We did everything we could
102.409	to stop al Qaeda
104.318	and the foreign fighters that
104.318	came in as suicide bombers
107.603	and as accelerants to the violence.
112.718	We honed our combat skills,
114.74	we developed new equipment,
117.576	we parachuted, we helicoptered,
120.03	we took small boats, we drove, and we walked
122.488	to objectives night after night to stop
125.498	the killing that this network was putting forward.
130.85	We bled,
133.39	we died,
134.879	and we killed to stop that organization
139.73	from the violence that they were putting
141.473	largely against the Iraqi people.
145.702	Now, we did what we knew,
148.28	how we had grown up, and
148.28	one of the things that we knew,
151.194	that was in our DNA, was secrecy.
154.32	It was security. It was protecting information.
156.237	It was the idea that information was the lifeblood
159.05	and it was what would protect and keep people safe.
162.69	And we had a sense that,
164.585	as we operated within our organizations,
166.596	it was important to keep information
168.514	in the silos within the organizations,
170.825	particularly only give information
173.739	to people had a demonstrated need to know.
177.931	But the question often came, who needed to know?
182.57	Who needed, who had to have the information
185.933	so that they could do the important 
185.933	parts of the job that you needed?
189.004	And in a tightly coupled world,
191.056	that's very hard to predict.
193.854	It's very hard to know who needs to have information
196.798	and who doesn't.
198.305	I used to deal with intelligence agencies,
200.284	and I'd complain that they weren't
200.284	sharing enough intelligence,
202.451	and with a straight face, they'd
202.451	look at me and they'd say,
204.841	"""What aren't you getting?"" (Laughter)"
206.988	"I said, ""If I knew that, we wouldn't have a problem."""
212.47	But what we found is we had to change.
214.072	We had to change our culture about information.
216.249	We had to knock down walls. We had to share.
218.366	We had to change from who needs to know
221.434	to the fact that who doesn't know,
223.557	and we need to tell, and tell
223.557	them as quickly as we can.
226.791	It was a significant culture shift for an organization
229.917	that had secrecy in its DNA.
235.241	We started by doing things, by building,
237.517	not working in offices,
239.222	knocking down walls, working in things we called
240.887	situation awareness rooms,
243.345	and in the summer of 2007,
245.821	something happened which demonstrated this.
247.444	We captured the personnel records
249.636	for the people who were bringing foreign fighters
251.836	into Iraq.
253.991	And when we got the personnel records, typically,
255.839	we would have hidden these,
257.153	shared them with a few intelligence agencies,
259.491	and then try to operate with them.
261.287	But as I was talking to my intelligence officer,
263.325	"I said, ""What do we do?"""
264.175	"And he said, ""Well, you found them."" Our command."
267.201	"""You can just declassify them."""
269.565	"And I said, ""Well, can we declassify them?"
271.213	"What if the enemy finds out?"""
272.223	"And he says, ""They're their personnel records."""
274.835	(Laughter)
276.235	So we did,
277.317	and a lot of people got upset about that,
279.351	but as we passed that information around,
281.835	suddenly you find that information is only of value
284.725	if you give it to people who have the ability
286.581	to do something with it.
288.719	The fact that I know something has zero value
290.845	if I'm not the person who can actually
292.333	make something better because of it.
294.207	So as a consequence, what we did was
296.083	we changed the idea of information,
299.193	instead of knowledge is power,
301.477	to one where sharing is power.
304.423	It was the fundamental shift,
306.395	not new tactics, not new weapons,
308.733	not new anything else.
310.037	It was the idea that we were now part of a team
312.815	in which information became the essential link
315.163	between us, not a block between us.
319.661	And I want everybody to take a deep breath
322.243	and let it out,
324.365	because in your life, there's going to be information
326.299	that leaks out you're not going to like.
328.631	Somebody's going to get my college grades out,
330.877	a that's going to be a disaster. (Laughter)
334.904	But it's going to be okay, and I will tell you that
338.273	I am more scared of the bureaucrat
341.493	that holds information in a desk drawer
343.945	or in a safe than I am of someone who leaks,
346.741	because ultimately, we'll be better off if we share.
349.677	Thank you.
351.437	(Applause)
357.761	Helen Walters: So I don't know if
357.761	you were here this morning,
359.337	if you were able to catch Rick Ledgett,
361.637	the deputy director of the NSA
363.469	who was responding to Edward
363.469	Snowden's talk earlier this week.
367.133	I just wonder, do you think the American government
369.445	should give Edward Snowden amnesty?
372.133	Stanley McChrystal: I think that
372.133	Rick said something very important.
374.581	We, most people, don't know all the facts.
377.201	I think there are two parts of this.
378.553	Edward Snowden shined a
378.553	light on an important need
382.293	that people had to understand.
383.783	He also took a lot of documents that he didn't have
386.765	the knowledge to know the importance of,
389.357	so I think we need to learn the facts about this case
391.79	before we make snap judgments
393.337	about Edward Snowden.
395.485	HW: Thank you so much. Thank you.
397.669	(Applause)
