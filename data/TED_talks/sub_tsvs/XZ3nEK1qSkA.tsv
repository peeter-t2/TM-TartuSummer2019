15.474	There's currently over a thousand
15.474	TED Talks on the TED website.
19.654	And I guess many of you here
19.654	think that this is quite fantastic,
24.674	except for me, I don't agree with this.
26.572	I think we have a situation here.
28.181	Because if you think about it,
28.181	1,000 TED Talks,
31.656	that's over 1,000 ideas worth spreading.
35.113	How on earth are you going
35.113	to spread a thousand ideas?
38.726	Even if you just try
38.726	to get all of those ideas into your head
41.618	by watching all those thousand TED videos,
43.663	it would actually currently take you
43.663	over 250 hours to do so.
47.823	And I did a little calculation of this.
50.411	The damage to the economy for each one
50.411	who does this is around $15,000.
54.94	So having seen this danger to the economy,
58.497	I thought, we need to find
58.497	a solution to this problem.
61.624	Here's my approach to it all.
63.406	If you look at the current situation,
63.406	you have a thousand TED Talks.
66.636	Each of those TED Talks has
66.636	an average length of about 2,300 words.
71.535	Now take this together, and you end up
71.535	with 2.3 million words of TED Talks,
76.259	which is about
76.259	three Bibles-worth of content.
78.969	(Laughter)
79.994	The obvious question here is,
79.994	does a TED Talk really need 2,300 words?
84.474	Isn't there something shorter?
85.963	I mean, if you have
85.963	an idea worth spreading,
88.067	surely you can put it
88.067	into something shorter than 2,300 words.
91.549	The only question is,
91.549	how short can you get?
94.267	What's the minimum amount of words
94.267	you would need to do a TED Talk?
98.205	While I was pondering this question,
99.951	I came across this urban legend
99.951	about Ernest Hemingway,
103.172	who allegedly said
103.172	that these six words here:
106.268	"""For sale: baby shoes, never worn,"""
109.144	were the best novel he had ever written.
111.882	And I also encountered a project
111.882	called Six-Word Memoirs
114.532	where people were asked,
114.532	take your whole life
116.676	and please sum this up
116.676	into six words, such as these here:
119.436	"""Found true love, married someone else."""
121.471	"Or ""Living in existential"
121.471	"vacuum; it sucks."""
123.87	I actually like that one.
125.952	So if a novel can be put into six words
128.372	and a whole memoir can be put
128.372	into six words,
131.978	you don't need more than six
131.978	words for a TED Talk.
134.923	We could have been done by lunch here.
138.165	(Laughter)
139.672	And if you did this
139.672	for all thousand TED Talks,
141.906	you would get from 2.3 million
141.906	words down to 6,000.
145.258	So I thought this was quite worthwhile.
147.155	So I started asking all my friends,
148.937	please take your favorite TED Talk
148.937	and put that into six words.
151.959	So here are some of the results
151.959	that I received.
154.227	I think they're quite nice.
155.599	For example, Dan Pink's talk
155.599	on motivation, which was pretty good,
158.723	if you haven't seen it:
158.723	"""Drop carrot. Drop stick. Bring meaning."""
161.853	It's what he's basically talking about
161.853	in those 18,5 minutes.
164.749	Or some even included references
164.749	to the speakers,
167.067	such as Nathan Myhrvold's speaking style,
167.067	or the one of Tim Ferriss,
170.295	which might be considered
170.295	a bit strenuous at times.
172.728	The challenge here is,
172.728	if I try to systematically do this,
175.473	I would probably end up
175.473	with a lot of summaries,
177.822	but not with many friends in the end.
179.618	So I had to find a different method,
179.618	preferably involving total strangers.
183.137	And luckily, there's a website for that,
183.137	called Mechanical Turk,
186.497	which is a website
186.497	where you can post tasks
188.689	that you don't want to do yourself,
190.403	"such as ""Please summarize this text"
190.403	"for me in six words."""
193.432	And I didn't allow any low-cost
193.432	countries to work on this,
196.291	but I found out I could get
196.291	a six-word summary for just 10 cents,
200.015	which I think is a pretty good price.
202.285	Even then, unfortunately,
204.009	it's not possible to summarize
204.009	each TED Talk individually.
206.878	Because if you do the math,
206.878	you have a thousand TED Talks,
209.656	you pay 10 cents each;
210.846	you have to do more than one summary
210.846	for each of those talks,
213.815	because some of them will probably
213.815	be, or are, really bad.
216.626	So I would end up paying
216.626	hundreds of dollars.
219.46	So I thought of a different way,
221.26	by thinking, well, the talks
221.26	revolve around certain themes.
224.658	So what if I don't let people summarize
224.658	individual TED Talks to six words,
229.343	but give them 10 TED Talks
229.343	at the same time
231.383	"and say, ""Please do a six-word"
231.383	"summary for that one."""
234.028	I would cut my costs by 90 percent.
236.215	So for $60,
238.769	I could summarize a thousand TED Talks
238.769	into just 600 summaries,
242.784	which would actually be quite nice.
244.806	Some of you might actually
244.806	right now be thinking,
247.123	it's downright crazy to have 10 TED Talks
247.123	summarized into just six words.
250.645	But it's actually not,
251.949	because there's an example
251.949	by statistics professor Hans Rosling.
255.102	I guess many of you have seen
255.102	one or more of his talks.
257.712	He's got eight talks online,
259.072	and those can basically be summed up
259.072	into just four words,
261.812	because that's all he's basically
261.812	showing us, our intuition is really bad.
266.44	He always proves us wrong.
267.83	So people on the Internet,
267.83	some didn't do so well.
270.417	And when I asked them to summarize
270.417	the 10 TED Talks at the same time,
273.834	some took the easy route out.
275.338	They just had some general comment.
277.773	There were others --
277.773	and I found this quite cheeky --
280.833	They used their six words
280.833	to talk back to me
283.267	and ask me if I'd been too much
283.267	on Google lately.
285.6	(Laughter)
286.783	And finally also, I never understood this,
289.9	some people really came up
289.9	with their own version of the truth.
293.058	I don't know any TED Talk
293.058	that contains this.
295.891	But, oh well.
297.465	In the end, however,
297.465	and this is really amazing,
299.825	for each of those 10 TED Talk
299.825	clusters that I submitted,
302.689	I actually received meaningful summaries.
304.675	Here are some of my favorites.
306.142	For example, for the TED Talks about food,
308.446	"someone summed this up into: ""Food shaping"
308.446	"body, brains and environment,"""
311.929	which I think is pretty good.
313.341	"Or happiness: ""Striving toward happiness ="
313.341	"moving toward unhappiness."""
316.655	So here I was.
317.832	I had started out
317.832	with a thousand TED Talks
319.866	and I had 600 six-word
319.866	summaries for those.
323.29	Actually, it sounded nice
323.29	in the beginning,
325.317	but when you look at 600 summaries,
325.317	it's quite a lot, it's a huge list.
328.739	(Laughter)
329.778	So I thought, I probably have
329.778	to take this one step further here
332.86	and create summaries of the summaries,
332.86	and this is exactly what I did.
336.512	So I took the 600 summaries that I had,
336.512	put them into nine groups
339.806	according to the ratings that the talks
339.806	had originally received on TED.com
343.718	and asked people to do summaries of those.
347.039	Again, there were some misunderstandings.
349.035	For example, when I had a cluster
349.035	"of all the ""Beautiful"" talks,"
352.024	someone thought I was just trying
352.024	to find the ultimate pick-up line.
355.267	But in the end, amazingly,
357.468	again, people were able to do it.
359.073	For example, all the courageous TED Talks:
361.151	"""People dying"" or ""People"
361.151	"suffering"" was also one,"
363.614	"""with easy solutions around."""
365.035	Or the recipe for the ultimate
365.035	jaw-dropping TED Talk:
367.544	"""Flickr photos of intergalactic"
367.544	"classical composer."""
370.099	I mean that's the essence of it all.
372.972	Now I had my nine groups, but, I mean,
372.972	it's already quite a reduction.
377.968	But of course, once you are that far,
377.968	you're not really satisfied.
381.427	I wanted to go all the way,
381.427	all the way down the distillery,
384.276	starting out with a thousand TED Talks.
386.19	I wanted to have a thousand TED Talks
386.19	summarized into just six words --
389.578	which would be a 99.9997 percent
389.578	reduction in content.
393.08	And I would only pay $99.50 --
396.741	so stay even below $100 for it.
399.87	So I had 50 overall summaries done.
401.587	This time I paid 25 cents
403.019	because I thought the task
403.019	was a bit harder.
405.147	And unfortunately,
405.147	when I first received the answers --
408.599	and here, you'll see six of the answers --
408.599	I was a bit disappointed.
411.841	Because I think you'll agree,
411.841	they all summarize some aspect of TED,
415.089	but to me, they felt a bit bland,
417.037	or they just had
417.037	a certain aspect of TED in them.
420.33	So I was almost ready to give up
422.118	when one night, I played around
422.118	with these sentences
425.241	and found out that there's actually
425.241	a beautiful solution in here.
429.188	So here it is,
431.576	a crowd-sourced, six-word
431.576	summary of a thousand TED Talks
435.582	at the value of $99.50:
438.79	"""Why the worry? I'd rather wonder."""
441.456	Thank you very much.
442.743	(Applause)
