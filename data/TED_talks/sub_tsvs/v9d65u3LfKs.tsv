25	The advances that have taken place in astronomy,
29	cosmology and biology, in the last 10 years,
36	are really extraordinary --
40	to the point where we know more about our universe and how it works
44	than many of you might imagine.
50	But there was something else that I've noticed
53	as those changes were taking place, as people were starting to find out that
56	hmm ... yeah, there really is a black hole at the center of every galaxy.
61	The science writers and editors -- I shouldn't say science writers,
64	I should say people who write about science --
68	and editors would sit down over a couple of beers,
70	after a hard day of work, and start talking about
74	some of these incredible perceptions about how the universe works.
79	And they would inevitably end up in what I thought was a very bizarre place,
84	which is ways the world could end very suddenly.
88	And that's what I want to talk about today. (Laughter)
93	Ah, you laugh, you fools. (Laughter)
100	(Voice: Can we finish up a little early?)
102	(Laughter) Yeah, we need the time!
107	Stephen Petranek: At first, it all seemed a little fantastical to me, but after challenging a lot of these ideas,
113	I began to take a lot of them seriously. And then September 11 happened,
117	and I thought, ah, God,
119	I can't go to the TED conference and talk about how the world is going to end.
122	Nobody wants to hear that. Not after this!
127	And that got me into a discussion with some other people, other scientists,
131	about maybe some other subjects, and one of the guys I talked to,
135	who was a neuroscientist, said,
137	"""You know, I think there are a lot of solutions to the problems you brought up,"""
141	and reminds me of Michael's talk yesterday
145	and his mother saying you can't have a solution if you don't have a problem.
149	So, we went out looking for solutions to ways that the world might end tomorrow,
154	and lo and behold, we found them.
157	Which leads me to a videotape of a President Bush
163	press conference from a couple of weeks ago.
165	Can we run that, Andrew?
167	President George W. Bush: Whatever it costs to defend our security,
171	and whatever it costs to defend our freedom, we must pay it.
176	SP: I agree with the president.
177	He wants two trillion dollars to protect us from terrorists next year,
183	a two-trillion-dollar federal budget, which will land us back into deficit spending real fast.
189	But terrorists aren't the only threat we face.
192	There are really serious calamities staring us in the eye
197	that we're in the same kind of denial about
199	that we were about terrorism, and what could've happened on September 11.
205	I would propose, therefore, that if we took 10 billion dollars
211	from that 2.13 trillion dollar budget --
214	which is two one hundredths of that budget --
220	and we doled out a billion dollars to each one of these problems
224	I'm going to talk to you about, the vast majority could be solved,
228	and the rest we could deal with. So, I hope you find this both fascinating --
234	I'm fascinated by this kind of stuff, I gotta admit --
237	to me these are Richard's cockroaches.
243	But I also hope, because I think the people in this room can literally change the world,
249	I hope you take some of this stuff away with you,
253	and when you have an opportunity to be influential,
257	that you try to get some heavy-duty money spent on some of these ideas.
261	So let's start. Number 10: we lose the will to survive.
270	We live in an incredible age of modern medicine.
273	We are all much healthier than we were 20 years ago.
277	People around the world are getting better medicine --
282	but mentally, we're falling apart.
285	The World Health Organization now estimates
287	that one out of five people on the planet is clinically depressed.
293	And the World Health Organization also says that depression is the
298	biggest epidemic that humankind has ever faced.
304	Soon, genetic breakthroughs and even better medicine
307	are going to allow us to think of 100 as a normal lifespan.
313	A female child born tomorrow, on average -- median -- will live to age 83.
321	Our life longevity is going up almost a year for every year that passes.
326	Now the problem with all of this, getting older,
328	is that people over 65 are the most likely people to commit suicide.
333	So, what are the solutions?
335	We don't really have mental health insurance in this country,
338	and it's -- (Applause) -- it's really a crime.
342	Something like 98 percent of all people with depression,
346	and I mean really severe depression
347	-- I have a friend with stunningly severe depression
352	-- this is a curable disease, with present medicine and present technology.
356	But it is often a combination of talk therapy and pills.
360	Pills alone don't do it, especially in clinically depressed people.
365	You ought to be able to go to a psychiatrist or a psychologist,
369	and put down your 10-dollar copay, and get treated,
371	just like you do when you got a cut on your arm. It's ridiculous.
375	Secondly, drug companies are not going to develop really sophisticated
380	psychoactive drugs. We know that most mental illnesses have a biological
387	component that can be dealt with.
390	And we know just an amazing amount more about the brain now than we
393	did 10 years ago. We need a pump-push from the federal government,
398	through NIH and National Science -- NSF --
403	and places like that to start helping the drug companies
405	develop some advanced psychoactive drugs.
409	Moving on. Number nine -- don't laugh -- aliens invade Earth.
414	Ten years ago, you couldn't have found an astronomer --
417	well, very few astronomers -- in the world who would've told you that
420	there are any planets anywhere outside our solar system.
428	we're finding about two or three a month.
432	All of the ones we've found, by the way, are in this little, teeny, tiny corner where we live,
435	in the Milky Way. There must be millions of planets in the Milky Way,
441	and as Carl Sagan insisted for many years,
444	and was laughed at for it, there must be billions and billions in the universe.
449	In a few years, NASA is going to launch four or five telescopes out to Jupiter,
453	where there's less dust, and start looking for Earth-like planets,
457	which we cannot see with present technology, nor detect.
461	It's becoming obvious that the chance that life does not exist elsewhere in the universe,
469	and probably fairly close to us, is a fairly remote idea.
473	And the chance that some of it isn't more intelligent than ours is also a remote idea.
479	Remember, we've only been an advanced civilization --
481	an industrial civilization, if you would -- for 200 years.
485	Although every time I go to Pompeii, I'm amazed that they had
488	the equivalent of a McDonald's on every street corner, too.
490	So, I don't know how much civilization really has progressed since AD 79,
494	but there's a great likelihood. I really believe this,
498	and I don't believe in aliens, and I don't believe there are any aliens on the Earth
503	or anything like that. But there's a likelihood that we will confront a
506	civilization that is more intelligent than our own.
509	Now, what will happen? What if they come to, you know,
513	suck up our oceans for the hydrogen?
516	And swat us away like flies, the way we swat away flies when we go into
519	the rainforest and start logging it.
522	We can look at our own history. The late physicist Gerard O'Neill said,
527	"""Advanced Western civilization has had a destructive effect"
530	on all primitive civilizations it has come in contact with,
534	even in those cases where every attempt was made
537	"to protect and guard the primitive civilization."""
542	If the aliens come visiting, we're the primitive civilization.
546	So, what are the solutions to this? (Laughter)
555	Thank God you can all read!
558	It may seem ridiculous, but we have a really lousy history of anticipating things like this
565	and actually being prepared for them.
567	How much energy and money does it take to actually have a plan
570	to negotiate with an advanced species?
575	Secondly -- and you're going to hear more from me about this --
579	we have to become an outward-looking, space-faring nation.
582	We have got to develop the
583	idea that the Earth doesn't last forever,
586	our sun doesn't last forever.
588	If we want humanity to last forever, we have to colonize the Milky Way.
593	And that is not something that is beyond comprehension at this point.
599	(Applause)
602	It'll also help us a lot, if we meet an advanced civilization along the way,
606	if we're trying to be an advanced civilization. Number eight --
609	(Voice: Steve, that's what I'm doing after TED.) (Laughter) (Applause)
615	SP: You've got it! You've got the job.
618	Number eight: the ecosystem collapses.
620	Last July, in Science, the journal Science,
628	It wasn't really a research report; it was a screed.
631	They said, we've been looking at the oceans for a long time now,
634	and we want to tell you they're not in trouble, they're near collapse.
638	Many other ecosystems on Earth are in real, real danger.
644	We're living in a time of mass extinctions that exceeds the fossil record
647	by a factor of 10,000.
650	We have lost 25 percent of the unique species in Hawaii in the last 20 years.
655	California is expected to lose 25 percent of its species in the next 40 years.
661	Somewhere in the Amazon forest is the marginal tree.
665	You cut down that tree, the rain forest collapses as an ecosystem.
669	There's really a tree like that out there. That's really what it comes to.
672	And when that ecosystem collapses, it could take a major ecosystem with it,
677	like our atmosphere. So, what do we do about this? What are the solutions?
684	There is some modeling of ecosystems going on now.
687	The problem with ecosystems is that we understand them so poorly,
692	that we don't know they're really in trouble until it's almost too late.
696	We need to know earlier that they're getting in trouble,
700	and we need to be able to pump possible solutions into models.
704	And with the kind of computing power we have now,
707	there is, as I say, some of this going on, but it needs money.
710	National Science Foundation needs to say -- you know,
713	almost all the money that's spent on science in this country
716	comes from the federal government, one way or another.
719	And they get to prioritize, you know?
721	There are people at the National Science Foundation
722	who get to say, this is the most important thing.
725	This is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about.
727	Secondly, we need to create huge biodiversity reserves on the planet,
730	and start moving them around.
732	There's been an experiment for the last four or five years on the Georges Bank,
736	or the Grand Banks off of Newfoundland. It's a no-take fishing zone.
740	They can't fish there for a radius of 200 miles.
743	And an amazing thing has happened: almost all the fish have come back,
746	and they're reproducing like crazy. We're going to have to start doing this
750	around the globe. We're going to have to have no-take zones.
752	We're going to have to say, no more logging in the Amazon for 20 years.
756	Let it recover, before we start logging again.
758	(Applause)
764	Number seven: particle accelerator mishap.
768	You all remember Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber?
771	One of the things he raved about was that a particle accelerator experiment
775	could go haywire and set off a chain reaction that would destroy the world.
780	A lot of very sober-minded physicists, believe it or not,
782	have had exactly the same thought.
785	This spring -- there's a collider at Brookhaven, on Long Island --
788	this spring, it's going to have an experiment in which it creates black holes.
792	They are expecting to create little, tiny black holes.
796	They expect them to evaporate. (Laughter)
803	I hope they're right. (Laughter)
806	Other collider experiments -- there's one that's going to take place next summer
810	at CERN -- have the possibility of creating something called strangelets,
814	which are kind of like antimatter. Whenever they hit other matter, they destroy it
818	and obliterate it. Most physicists say that the accelerators we have now
822	are not really powerful enough to create black holes and strangelets
825	that we need to worry about, and they're probably right.
828	But, all around the world, in Japan, in Canada,
832	there's talk about this, of reviving this in the United States.
834	We shut one down that was going to be big.
836	But there's talk of building very big accelerators.
840	What can we do about this? What are the solutions?
843	We've got the fox watching the henhouse here.
845	We need to -- we need the advice of particle physicists to talk about particle physics
851	and what should be done in particle physics,
853	but we need some outside thinking and watchdogging
858	of what's going on with these experiments.
861	Secondly, we have a natural laboratory surrounding the Earth.
864	We have an electromagnetic field around the Earth,
866	and it's constantly bombarded by high-energy particles, like protons.
871	And in my opinion, we don't spend enough time
875	looking at that natural laboratory and figuring out first what's safe to do on Earth.
882	Number six: biotech disaster.
885	It's one of my favorite ones, because we've done several stories on Bt corn.
888	Bt corn is a corn that creates its own pesticide to kill a corn borer.
894	You may of heard of it -- heard it called StarLink,
898	especially when all those taco shells were taken out of the supermarkets
902	about a year and a half ago.
904	This stuff was supposed to only be feed for animals in the United States,
908	and it got into the human food supply, and somebody should've figured out
912	that it would get in the human food supply very easily.
915	But the thing that's alarming is a couple of months ago, in Mexico,
918	where Bt corn and all genetically altered corn is totally illegal,
922	they found Bt corn genes in wild corn plants.
926	Now, corn originated, we think, in Mexico.
929	This is the genetic biodiversity storehouse of corn.
934	This brings back a skepticism that has gone away recently,
940	that superweeds and superpests could spread around the world,
944	from biotechnology, that literally could destroy the world's food supply
949	in very short order.
951	So, what do we do about that?
955	We treat biotechnology with the same scrutiny we apply to nuclear power plants.
960	It's that simple. This is an amazingly unregulated field.
963	When the StarLink disaster happened, there was a battle between the
966	EPA and the FDA over who really had authority, and over what parts of this,
971	and they didn't get it straightened out for months. That's kind of crazy.
975	Number five, one of my favorites: reversal of the Earth's magnetic field.
980	Believe it or not, this happens every few hundred thousand years,
983	and has happened many times in our history.
985	North Pole goes to the South, South Pole goes to the North, and vice versa.
990	But what happens, as this occurs,
993	is that we lose our magnetic field around the Earth over the period of about 100 years,
999	and that means that all these cosmic rays and particles
1001	that are to come streaming at us from the sun,
1004	that this field protects us from, are -- well, basically, we're gonna fry. (Laughter)
1017	(Voice: Steve, I have some additional hats downstairs.)
1021	SP: So, what can we do about this? Oh, by the way, we're overdue.
1025	It's been 780,000 years since this happened.
1027	So, it should have happened about 480,000 years ago.
1030	Oh, and here's one other thing.
1032	Scientists think now our magnetic field may be diminished by about five percent.
1040	So, maybe we're in the throes of it.
1044	One of the problems of trying to figure out how healthy the Earth is,
1048	is that we have -- you know, we don't have good weather data from 60 years ago,
1052	much less data on things like the ozone layer.
1056	So, there's a fairly simple solution to this.
1060	There's going to be a lot of cheap rocketry that's going to come online
1063	in about six or seven years
1065	that gets us into the low atmosphere very cheaply.
1069	You know, we can make ozone from car tailpipes.
1072	It's not hard: it's just three oxygen atoms.
1075	If you brought the entire ozone layer down to the surface of the Earth,
1079	it would be the thickness of two pennies, at 14 pounds per square inch.
1082	You don't need that much up there.
1085	We need to learn how to repair and replenish the Earth's ozone layer.
1088	(Applause)
1092	Number four: giant solar flares.
1095	Solar flares are enormous magnetic outbursts from the Sun
1099	that bombard the Earth with high-speed subatomic particles.
1103	So far, our atmosphere has done, and our magnetic field has done
1106	pretty well protecting us from this.
1109	Occasionally, we get a flare from the Sun that causes havoc
1113	with communications and so forth, and electricity.
1117	But the alarming thing is that astronomers recently have been studying
1120	stars that are similar to our Sun,
1122	and they've found that a number of them, when they're about the age of our Sun,
1126	brighten by a factor of as much as 20. Doesn't last for very long.
1131	And they think these are super-flares, millions of times more powerful
1133	than any flares we've had from our Sun so far.
1138	Obviously, we don't want one of those. (Laughter)
1142	There's a flip side to it. In studying stars
1144	like our Sun, we've found that they go through periods of diminishment,
1148	when their total amount of energy that's expelled from them
1152	goes down by maybe one percent.
1154	One percent doesn't sound like a lot, but it would cause one hell of an ice age here.
1158	So, what can we do about this?
1160	(Laughter) Start terraforming Mars. This is one of my favorite subjects.
1163	I wrote a story about this in Life magazine in 1993.
1167	This is rocket science, but it's not hard rocket science.
1171	Everything that we need to make an atmosphere on Mars,
1174	and to make a livable planet on Mars, is probably there.
1178	And you just, literally, have to send little nuclear factories up there
1184	that gobble up the iron oxide on the surface of Mars and spit out the oxygen.
1189	The problem is it takes 300 years to terraform Mars, minimum.
1193	Really more like 500 years to do it right.
1196	There's no reason why we shouldn't start now. (Laughter)
1200	Number three -- isn't this stuff cool? (Laughter)
1207	A new global epidemic. People have been at war with germs
1210	ever since there have been people,
1211	and from time to time, the germs sure get the upper hand.
1215	In 1918, we had a flu epidemic in the United States that killed 20 million people.
1220	That was back when the population was around 100 million people.
1224	The bubonic plague in Europe, in the Middle Ages,
1227	killed one out of four Europeans.
1231	AIDS is coming back. Ebola seems to be rearing its head
1235	with much too much frequency,
1238	and old diseases like cholera are becoming resistant to antibiotics.
1243	We've all learned what -- the kind of panic that can occur
1245	when an old disease rears its head, like anthrax.
1250	The worst possibility is that a very simple germ, like staph,
1257	for which we have one antibiotic that still works, mutates.
1262	And we know staph can do amazing things.
1264	A staph cell can be next to a muscle cell in your body and borrow genes from it
1269	when antibiotics come, and change and mutate.
1273	The danger is that some germ like staph will be --
1275	will mutate into something that's really virulent, very contagious,
1280	and will sweep through populations before we can do anything about it.
1284	That's happened before. About 12,000 years ago,
1286	there was a massive wave of mammal extinctions in the Americas,
1291	and that is thought to have been a virulent disease.
1294	So, what can we do about it?
1295	It is nuts. We give antibiotics -- (Applause) --
1301	every cow, every lamb, every chicken, they get antibiotics every day, all.
1306	You know, you go to a restaurant, you eat fish, I got news for you,
1308	it's all farmed. You know, you gotta ask when you go to a restaurant if it's a wild fish,
1312	cause they're not going to tell you. We're giving away the code.
1315	This is like being at war and giving somebody your secret code.
1318	We're telling the germs out there how to fight us.
1323	We gotta fix that. We gotta outlaw that right away.
1325	Secondly, our public health system, as we saw with anthrax, is a real disaster.
1329	We have a real, major outbreak of disease in the United States,
1335	we are not prepared to cope with it.
1337	Now, there is money in the federal budget, next year,
1339	to build up the public health service.
1341	But I don't think to any extent that it really needs to be done.
1346	Number two -- my favorite -- we meet a rogue black hole.
1350	You know, 10 years ago, or 15 years ago, really,
1353	you walk into an astronomy convention, and you say,
1355	"""You know, there's probably a black hole at the center of every galaxy,"""
1358	and they're going to hoot you off the stage.
1360	And now, if you went into one of those conventions and you said,
1362	"""Well, I don't think black holes are out there,"" they'd hoot you off the stage."
1366	Our comprehension of the way the universe works is really --
1369	has just gained unbelievably in recent years.
1374	We think that there are about 10 million dead stars in the Milky Way alone, our galaxy.
1381	And these stars have compressed down to maybe something like 12, 15 miles wide,
1385	and they are black holes. And they are gobbling up everything around them,
1388	including light, which is why we can't see them.
1393	Most of them should be in orbit around something.
1396	But galaxies are very violent places, and things can be spun out of orbit.
1400	And also, space is incredibly vast.
1403	So even if you flung a million of these things out of orbit,
1408	the chances that one would actually hit us is fairly remote.
1411	But it only has to get close, about a billion miles away, one of these things.
1419	About a billion miles away, here's what happens to Earth's orbit:
1422	it becomes elliptical instead of circular.
1425	And for three months out of the year,
1427	the surface temperatures go up to 150 to 180.
1431	For three months out of the year, they go to 50 below zero.
1434	That won't work too well. What can we do about this?
1436	And this is my scariest. (Laughter)
1444	I don't have a good answer for this one.
1449	Again, we gotta think about being a colonizing race.
1453	And finally, number one: biggest danger to life as we know it, I think,
1458	a really big asteroid heads for Earth.
1461	The important thing to remember here -- this is not a question of if,
1465	this is a question of when, and how big.
1469	In 1908, just a 200-foot piece of a comet
1473	exploded over Siberia and flattened forests for maybe 100 miles.
1477	It had the effect of about 1,000 Hiroshima bombs.
1482	Astronomers estimate that little asteroids like that come about every hundred years.
1487	In 1989, a large asteroid passed 400,000 miles away from Earth.
1494	Nothing to worry about, right?
1496	It passed directly through Earth's orbit. We were in that that spot six hours earlier.
1506	A small asteroid, say a half mile wide, would touch off firestorms
1510	followed by severe global cooling from the debris kicked up --
1514	Carl Sagan's nuclear winter thing.
1516	An asteroid five miles wide causes major extinctions.
1520	We think the one that got the dinosaurs was about five miles wide.
1523	Where are they? There's something called the Kuiper belt,
1526	which -- some people think Pluto's not a planet,
1531	that's where Pluto is, it's in the Kuiper belt.
1534	There's also something a little farther out, called the Oort cloud.
1536	There are about 100,000 balls of ice and rock -- comets, really --
1542	out there, that are 50 miles in diameter or more,
1546	and they regularly take a little spin,
1548	in towards the Sun and pass reasonably close to us.
1554	Of more concern, I think, is the asteroids that exist between Mars and Jupiter.
1563	The folks at the Sloan Digital Sky Survey told us last fall --
1566	they're making the first map of the universe, three-dimensional map of the universe --
1570	that there are probably 700,000 asteroids between Mars and Jupiter
1575	that are a half a mile big or bigger.
1580	So you say, yeah, well, what are really the chances of this happening?
1586	Andrew, can you put that chart up?
1589	This is a chart that Dr. Clark Chapman at the Southwest Research Institute
1594	presented to Congress a few years ago.
1597	You'll notice that the chance of an asteroid-slash-comet impact killing you
1601	is about one in 20,000, according to the work they've done.
1604	Now look at the one right below that.
1606	Passenger aircraft crash, one in 20,000.
1611	We spend an awful lot of money trying to be sure that we don't die in airplane accidents,
1616	and we're not spending hardly anything on this. And yet, this is completely preventable.
1623	We finally have, just in the last year, the technology to stop this cold.
1627	Could we have the solutions?
1629	NASA's spending three million dollars a year, three million bucks --
1633	that is like pocket change -- to search for asteroids.
1636	Because we can actually figure out every asteroid that's out there,
1641	and if it might hit Earth, and when it might hit Earth.
1644	And they're trying to do that.
1645	But it's going to take them 10 years, at spending three million dollars a year,
1649	and even then, they claim they'll only have about 80 percent of them catalogued.
1653	Comets are a tougher act.
1655	We don't really have the technology to predict comet trajectories,
1658	or when one with our name on it might arrive.
1661	But we would have lots of time, if we see it coming.
1664	We really need a dedicated observatory.
1667	You'll notice that a lot of comets are named after people you never heard of,
1670	amateur astronomers? That's because nobody's looking for them, except amateurs.
1674	We need a dedicated observatory that looks for comets.
1678	Part two of the solutions: we need to figure out how to blow up an asteroid,
1683	or alter its trajectory. Now, a year ago, we did an amazing thing.
1687	We sent a probe out to this asteroid belt,
1689	called NEAR, Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous.
1692	And these guys orbited a 30 -- or no, about a 22-mile long asteroid called Eros.
1700	And then, of course, you know, they pulled one of those sneaky NASA things,
1703	where they had extra batteries and extra gas aboard and everything,
1706	and then, at the last minute, they landed.
1708	When the mission was over, they actually landed on the thing.
1711	We have landed a rocket ship on an asteroid. It's not a big deal.
1716	Now, the trouble with just sending a bomb out for this thing
1719	is that you don't have anything to push against in space, because there's no air.
1723	A nuclear explosion is just as hot,
1725	but we don't really have anything big enough to melt a 22-mile long asteroid,
1731	or vaporize it, would be more like it.
1733	But we can learn to land on these asteroids that have our name on them
1738	and put something like a small ion propulsion motor on it,
1742	which would gently, slowly, after a period of time, push it into a different trajectory,
1747	which, if we've done our math right, would keep it from hitting Earth.
1750	This is just a matter of finding 'em, going there, and doing something about it.
1755	I know your head is spinning from all this stuff.
1758	Yikes! So many big threats!
1761	The thing, I think, to remember, is September 11.
1763	We don't want to get caught flat-footed again.
1766	We know about this stuff.
1768	Science has the power to predict the future in many cases now.
1772	Knowledge is power.
1774	The worst thing we can do is say, jeez, I got enough to worry about
1779	without worrying about an asteroid. (Laughter)
1785	That's a mistake that could literally cost us our future.
1788	Thank you.
