12.738	I'm a marine biologist
12.738	and an explorer-photographer
15.922	with National Geographic,
17.687	but I want to share a secret.
19.793	This image is totally incorrect,
23.46	totally incorrect.
25.221	I see a couple of people
25.221	crying in the back
27.372	that I've blown their idea of mermaids.
29.84	All right, the mermaid is indeed real,
32.515	but anyone who's gone on a dive
34.674	will know that the ocean
34.674	looks more like this.
37.767	It's because the ocean
37.767	is this massive filter,
41.291	and as soon as you start going underwater,
43.388	you're going to lose your colors,
45.085	and it's going to get dark
45.085	and blue very quickly.
48.315	But we're humans --
48.315	we're terrestrial mammals.
51.124	And we've got trichromatic vision,
53.323	so we see in red, green and blue,
56.013	and we're just complete color addicts.
58.362	We love eye-popping color,
61.029	and we try to bring this eye-popping color
63.64	underwater with us.
65.044	So there's been a long and sordid history
65.044	of bringing color underwater,
69.105	and it starts 88 years ago
69.105	with Bill Longley and Charles Martin,
74.075	who were trying to take
74.075	the first underwater color photograph.
77.02	And they're in there
77.02	with old-school scuba suits,
79.759	where you're pumping air down to them,
81.908	and they've got a pontoon
81.908	of high-explosive magnesium powder,
87.522	and the poor people
87.522	at the surface are not sure
89.753	when they're going to pull the string
89.753	when they've got their frame in focus,
93.407	and -- boom! -- a pound
93.407	of high explosives would go off
96.355	so they could put
96.355	a little bit of light underwater
99.434	and get an image
99.434	like this beautiful hogfish.
102.228	I mean, it's a gorgeous image,
102.228	but this is not real.
105.101	They're creating an artificial environment
107.884	so we can satisfy
107.884	our own addiction to color.
111.996	And looking at it the other way,
111.996	what we've been finding
115.848	is that instead of bringing color
115.848	underwater with us,
119.076	that we've been looking at the blue ocean,
121.852	and it's a crucible of blue,
124.138	and these animals living there
124.138	for millions of years
127.258	have been evolving all sorts of ways
127.258	to take in that blue light
131.812	and give off other colors.
133.527	And here's just a little sample
133.527	of what this secret world looks like.
136.837	It's like an underwater light show.
138.739	(Music)
143.495	Again, what we're seeing here
143.495	is blue light hitting this image.
147.439	These animals are absorbing the blue light
149.552	and immediately transforming this light.
155.39	So if you think about it, the ocean
155.39	is 71 percent of the planet,
159.787	and blue light can extend down
159.787	to almost a 1,000 meters.
163.881	As we go down underwater,
166.009	after about 10 meters,
166.009	all the red is gone.
168.727	So if you see anything
168.727	under 10 meters that's red,
171.954	it's an animal transforming
171.954	and creating its own red.
175.472	This is the largest single monochromatic
175.472	blue environment on our planet.
182.67	And my gateway into this world
182.67	of biofluorescence begins with corals.
187.384	And I want to give
187.384	a full TED Talk on corals
189.494	and just how cool these things are.
191.32	One of the things that they do,
191.32	one of their miraculous feats,
194.566	is they produce lots of these
194.566	fluorescent proteins,
197.368	fluorescent molecules.
198.877	And in this coral, it could be making
198.877	up to 14 percent of its body mass --
203.648	could be this fluorescent protein.
205.757	So you wouldn't be making, like,
210.21	so it's likely doing something
210.21	that has a functional role.
213.818	And for the last 10, 15 years,
213.818	this was so special to me,
217.679	because this molecule has turned out
217.679	to be one of the most revolutionary tools
223.123	in biomedical science,
224.847	and it's allowing us
224.847	to better see inside ourselves.
229.464	So, how do I study this?
231.829	In order to study biofluorescence,
231.829	we swim at night.
234.924	And when I started out,
236.326	I was just using these blue
236.326	duct-tape filters over my strobe,
240.361	so I could make sure
240.361	I'm actually seeing the light
242.764	that's being transformed by the animals.
244.82	We're making an exhibit
244.82	for the Museum of Natural History,
248.321	and we're trying to show off how great
248.321	the fluorescent corals are on the reef,
252.152	and something happened
252.152	that just blew me away:
255.232	this.
256.645	In the middle of our corals,
258.485	is this green fluorescent fish.
261.515	It's the first time we've ever seen
261.515	a green fluorescent fish
264.351	or any vertebrate for that matter.
266.002	And we're rubbing our eyes,
266.002	checking the filters,
268.581	thinking that somebody's maybe
268.581	playing a joke on us with the camera,
271.804	but the eel was real.
273.771	It was the first green
273.771	fluorescent eel that we found,
277.334	and this just changed
277.334	my trajectory completely.
280.317	So I had to put down my corals and team up
283.675	with a fish scientist, John Sparks,
285.732	and begin a search around the world
288.255	to see how prevalent this phenomenon is.
291.53	And fish are much more
291.53	interesting than corals,
294.029	because they have really advanced vision,
296.267	and some of the fish even have,
296.267	the way that I was photographing it,
300.076	they have lenses in their eyes
300.076	that would magnify the fluorescence.
303.536	So I wanted to seek this out further.
305.87	So we designed a new set of gear
307.616	and we're scouring the reefs
307.616	around the world,
309.929	looking for fluorescent life.
311.532	"And it's a bit like ""E.T. phone home."""
313.611	We're out there swimming
313.611	with this blue light,
316.344	and we're looking for a response,
318.573	for animals to be absorbing the light
318.573	and transferring this back to us.
322.172	And eventually, we found
322.172	our photobombing Kaupichphys eel.
326.908	It's a really shy, reclusive eel
326.908	that we know almost nothing about.
331.402	They're only about the size of my finger,
333.387	and they spend about 99.9 percent
333.387	of their time hidden under a rock.
337.891	But these eels do come out to mate
337.891	under full-moon nights,
342.036	and that full-moon night
342.036	translates underwater to blue.
345.553	Perhaps they're using this
345.553	as a way to see each other,
348.107	quickly find each other, mate,
349.592	go back into their hole
349.592	for the next long stint of time.
353.33	But then we started to find
353.33	other fluorescent marine life,
356.234	like this green fluorescent bream,
359.055	with its, like, racing stripes
359.055	along its head and its nape,
363.064	and it's almost camouflaged
363.064	and fluorescing at the same intensity
367.389	as the fluorescent coral there.
370.19	After this fish,
372.301	we were introduced to this red
372.301	fluorescent scorpionfish
376.626	cloaked and hidden on this rock.
378.793	The only time we've ever seen this,
378.793	it's either on red fluorescent algae
382.618	or red fluorescent coral.
384.634	Later, we found this stealthy
384.634	green fluorescent lizardfish.
389.991	These lizardfish come in many varieties,
392.103	and they look almost exactly alike
392.103	under white light.
395.396	But if you look at them
395.396	under fluorescent light,
397.794	you see lots of patterns,
399.219	you can really see
399.219	the differences among them.
401.929	And in total -- we just reported
401.929	this last year --
404.89	we found over 200 species
404.89	of biofluorescent fish.
410.135	One of my inspirations is French artist
410.135	and biologist Jean Painlevé.
416.085	He really captures this entrepreneuring,
416.085	creative spirit in biology.
420.158	He would design his own gear,
420.158	make his own cameras,
423.985	and he was fascinated with the seahorse,
423.985	Hippocampus erectus,
428.003	and he filmed for the first time
428.003	the seahorse giving birth.
432.086	So this is the male seahorse.
433.662	They were one of the first fish
433.662	to start swimming upright
438.4	with their brain above their head.
440.052	The males give birth,
441.227	just phenomenal creatures.
444.955	So he stayed awake for days.
446.321	He even put this electrical visor
446.321	on his head that would shock him,
449.52	so he could capture this moment.
452.796	Now, I wish I could have shown Painlevé
454.94	the moment where we found
454.94	biofluorescent seahorses
458.061	in the exact same species
458.061	that he was studying.
460.784	And here's our footage.
462.022	(Music)
466.476	They're the most cryptic fish.
467.967	You could be swimming right on top of them
467.967	and not see the seahorse.
472.228	They would blend right into the algae,
472.228	which would also fluoresce red,
476.76	but they've got great vision,
478.245	and they go through
478.245	this long mating ritual,
480.443	and perhaps they're using it
480.443	in that effect.
483.647	But things got pretty edgy
487.442	when we found green
487.442	fluorescence in the stingray,
492.479	because stingrays are
492.479	in the Elasmobranch class,
495.267	which includes ...
497.075	sharks.
498.558	So I'm, like, a coral biologist.
502.161	Somebody's got to go down and check
502.161	to see if the sharks are fluorescent.
505.63	And there I am.
506.916	(Laughter)
508.338	"And I was like, ""Maybe I should"
508.338	"go back to corals."""
510.901	(Laughter)
511.957	It turns out that these sharks
511.957	are not fluorescent.
515.473	And then we found it.
516.913	In a deep, dark canyon
516.913	off the coast of California,
521.775	we found the first
521.775	biofluorescent swellshark,
526.236	right underneath all the surfers.
528.035	Here it is.
529.244	They're just about a meter long.
529.244	It's called a swellshark.
531.992	And they call them a swellshark
531.992	because if they're threatened,
534.928	they can gulp down water
534.928	and blow up like an inner tube,
537.698	about twice their size,
538.881	and wedge themselves under a rock,
538.881	so they don't get eaten by a predator.
544.158	And here is our first footage
544.158	of these biofluorescent swellsharks.
549.229	Just magnificent -- I mean,
549.229	they're showing these distinct patterns,
553.974	and there are areas that are fluorescent
553.974	and areas that are not fluorescent,
557.571	but they've also got these
557.571	twinkling spots on them
560.184	that are much brighter
560.184	than other parts of the shark.
562.799	But this is all beautiful to see.
565.35	I was like, this is gorgeous.
567.004	But what does it mean to the shark?
569.859	Can they see this?
571.23	And we looked in the literature,
572.786	and nothing was known
572.786	about this shark's vision.
575.968	So I took this shark to eye specialist
575.968	Ellis Loew at Cornell University,
580.174	and we found out that this shark
580.174	sees discretely and acutely
583.721	in the blue-green interface,
585.839	probably about 100 times better
585.839	than we can see in the dark,
588.693	but they only see blue-green.
590.443	So what it's doing
590.443	is taking this blue world
593.586	and it's absorbing the blue,
593.586	creating green.
596.363	It's creating contrast
596.363	that they can indeed see.
599.205	So we have a model,
600.38	showing that it creates an ability
600.38	for them to see all these patterns.
603.776	And males and females
603.776	also have, we're finding,
606.681	distinct patterns among them.
609.276	But our last find came really just
609.276	a few miles from where we are now,
614.733	in the Solomon Islands.
616.208	Swimming at night, I encountered
616.208	the first biofluorescent sea turtle.
620.692	So now it's going from fish
620.692	and sharks into reptiles,
624.128	which, again, this is only one month old,
627.436	but it shows us
627.436	that we know almost nothing
629.838	about this hawksbill turtle's vision.
632.136	And it makes me think about
632.136	how much more there is to learn.
635.016	And here in the Solomon Islands,
636.572	there's only a few thousand
636.572	breeding females of this species left,
640.167	and this is one of the hotspots for them.
642.235	So it shows us how much we need
642.235	to really protect these animals
645.326	while they're still here,
645.326	and understand them.
647.706	In thinking about biofluorescence,
649.874	I wanted to know, how deep does it go?
651.843	Does this go all the way
651.843	to the bottom of the ocean?
654.311	So we started using submarines,
654.311	and we equipped them
657.882	with special blue lights
657.882	on the front here.
660.08	And we dropped down,
662.064	and we noticed one important thing --
664.805	that as we get down to 1,000 meters,
668.127	it drops off.
669.467	There's no biofluorescent marine life
669.467	down there, below 1,000 meters --
673.395	almost nothing, it's just darkness.
675.424	So it's mainly a shallow phenomenon.
677.878	And below 1,000 meters,
679.355	we encountered the bioluminescent zone,
682.04	where nine out of 10 animals
682.04	are actually making their own lights
685.401	and flashing and blinking.
687.179	As I try to get deeper,
688.576	this is slapping on a one-person
688.576	submarine suit --
691.575	"some people call this my ""Jacques Cousteau"
691.575	"meets Woody Allen"" moment."
695.362	(Laughter)
696.537	But as we explore down here,
698.612	I was thinking about: How do we
698.612	interact with life delicately?
702.355	Because we're entering
702.355	a new age of exploration,
705.076	where we have to take great care,
706.903	and we have to set examples
706.903	how we explore.
709.622	So I've teamed up with roboticist Rob Wood
709.622	at Harvard University,
713.31	and we've been designing
713.31	squishy underwater robot fingers,
718.36	so we can delicately interact
718.36	with the marine life down there.
721.486	The idea is that most of our technologies
721.486	to explore the deep ocean
726.225	come from oil and gas and military,
729.029	who, you know, they're not really
729.029	caring to be gentle.
731.894	Some corals could be 1,000 years old.
734.601	You don't want to just go
734.601	and crush them with a big claw.
737.734	So my dream is something like this.
739.756	At night, I'm in a submarine,
742.076	I have force-feedback gloves,
744.21	and I could delicately set up
744.21	a lab in the front of my submarine,
747.552	where the squishy robot fingers
750.115	are delicately collecting
750.115	and putting things in jars,
752.624	and we can conduct our research.
754.607	Back to the powerful applied applications.
757.481	Here, you're looking at a living brain
760.345	that's using the DNA
760.345	of fluorescent marine creatures,
763.736	this one from jellyfish and corals,
765.766	to illuminate the living brain
765.766	and see its connections.
769.259	It's funny that we're using RGB
770.799	just to kind of satisfy
770.799	our own human intuition,
773.371	so we can see our brains better.
775.729	And even more mind-blowing,
777.801	is my close colleague
777.801	Vincent Pieribone at Yale,
780.935	who has actually designed and engineered
780.935	a fluorescent protein
784.336	that responds to voltage.
786.455	So he could see
786.455	when a single neuron fires.
789.581	You're essentially looking at
789.581	a portal into consciousness
794.144	that was designed by marine creatures.
798.102	So this brings me all back
798.102	to perspective and relationship.
802.812	From deep space,
805.075	our universe looks
805.075	like a human brain cell,
808.251	and then here we are in the deep ocean,
810.757	and we're finding
810.757	marine creatures and cells
813.652	that can illuminate the human mind.
815.955	And it's my hope
815.955	that with illuminated minds,
819.097	we could ponder the overarching
819.097	interconnectedness of all life,
822.906	and fathom how much more lies in store
825.288	if we keep our oceans healthy.
827.027	Thank you.
828.209	(Applause)
