12.734	I'm a relationship builder.
14.964	When you think of a relationship builder,
16.96	don't you just automatically
16.96	"think ""architect?"""
19.742	Probably not.
21.897	That's because most people think
21.897	architects design buildings and cities,
26.127	but what we really design
26.127	are relationships,
29.203	because cities are about people.
31.334	They're places where people come together
31.334	for all kinds of exchange.
34.74	And besides, skylines
34.74	are highly specific urban habitats
37.981	with their own insects,
37.981	plants and animals,
40.323	and even their own weather.
42.47	But today, urban habitats
42.47	are out of balance.
45.623	Climate change, together with political
45.623	and economic troubles,
49.679	are having an impact;
50.855	they're adding up
50.855	and stressing out cities and us,
54.191	the people who live in them.
56.82	For me, the field of ecology
56.82	has provided important insight,
60.469	because ecologists don't just look
60.469	at individual species on their own,
64.702	they look at the relationships
64.702	between living things
67.919	and their environment.
70.374	They look at how all the diverse parts
70.374	of the ecosystem are interconnected,
74.276	and it's actually this balance,
74.276	this web of life, that sustains life.
79.088	My team and I have been applying
79.088	insights from ecology to architecture
83.704	to see how physical space
83.704	can help build stronger relationships.
88.124	The projects I'm going to show you today
90.11	use the idea of building relationships
90.11	as the key driver for design.
94.672	Here's an example of what I mean.
96.529	Recently, we were asked to design
96.529	a center for social justice leadership
100.702	called the Arcus Center.
102.922	They asked us for a building
102.922	that could break down traditional barriers
106.468	between different groups
107.776	and in doing so, create possibilities
107.776	for meaningful conversations
112.047	around social justice.
114.053	The students wanted a place
114.053	for cultural exchange.
116.734	They thought a place for preparing
116.734	food together could do that.
120.557	And they wanted to be welcoming
120.557	to the outside community.
123.312	They thought a fireplace
123.312	could draw people in
125.999	and help start conversations.
129.373	And everybody wanted the work
129.373	of social justice to be visible
132.862	to the outside world.
135.388	There really wasn't a precedent
135.388	for this kind of space,
138.153	so we looked around the globe
138.153	and found examples
140.644	of community meeting houses.
142.794	Community meeting houses are places
145.008	where there's very specific
145.008	relationships between people,
148.393	like this one in Mali,
148.393	where the elders gather.
152.009	The low roof keeps everybody seated
152.009	and at equal eye level.
155.585	It's very egalitarian.
156.832	I mean, you can't stand up
156.832	and take over the meeting.
159.334	You'd actually bump your head.
160.871	(Laughter)
162.548	In meeting houses,
162.548	there's always a central space
165.186	where you can sit around a circle
165.186	and see each other.
167.861	So we designed a space just like that
169.906	right in the middle of the Arcus Center,
171.909	and we anchored it
171.909	with a fireplace and a kitchen.
174.923	It's pretty hard to get a kitchen
174.923	and a fireplace in a building like this
178.419	with the building codes,
179.647	but it was so important
179.647	to the concept, we got it done.
183.108	And now the central space
183.108	works for big social gatherings
186.913	and a place to meet one-on-one
186.913	for the very first time.
190.175	It's almost like
190.175	this three-way intersection
192.278	that encourages bumping into people
192.278	and starting a conversation.
196.496	Now you can always pass the kitchen
196.496	and see something going on.
199.664	You can sit by the fireplace
199.664	and share stories.
203.574	You can study together
203.574	in big groups or in small ones,
206.795	because the architecture
206.795	sets up these opportunities.
211.461	Even the construction
211.461	is about building relationships.
214.088	It's made of cordwood masonry,
215.973	which is using logs
215.973	the way you would use bricks.
218.934	It's super low-tech and easy to do
218.934	and anyone can do it --
221.929	and that's the entire point.
223.63	The act of making is a social activity.
228.232	And it's good for the planet, too:
230.264	the trees absorbed carbon
230.264	when they were growing up,
233.384	and they gave off oxygen,
235.052	and now that carbon
235.052	is trapped inside the walls
237.817	and it's not being released
237.817	into the atmosphere.
241.014	So making the walls is equivalent
241.014	to taking cars right off the road.
245.969	We chose the building method
248.262	because it connects people
248.262	to each other and to the environment.
253.255	But is it working?
254.43	Is it creating relationships
254.43	and nurturing them?
256.72	How can we know?
258.062	Well, more and more people
258.062	are coming here, for one,
261.497	and as a result of the fireside chats
263.841	and a full calendar of programming,
265.963	people are applying
265.963	for the Arcus Fellowships.
268.575	In fact, applications have increased
268.575	tenfold for the Arcus Fellowship
272.898	since the building opened.
274.187	It's working. It's bringing
274.187	people together.
278.074	So I've shown how architecture
278.074	can connect people
280.466	on this kind of horizontal campus scale.
283.165	But we wondered if social relationships
283.165	could be scaled up --
286.687	or rather, upward -- in tall buildings.
290.201	Tall buildings don't necessarily lend
290.201	themselves to being social buildings.
294.262	They can seem isolating and inward.
296.646	You might only see people
296.646	in those awkward elevator rides.
302.496	But in several major cities,
302.496	I've been designing tall buildings
306.031	that are based on creating
306.031	relationships between people.
309.396	This is Aqua.
310.896	It's a residential high-rise in Chicago
314.494	aimed at young urban professionals
314.494	and empty nesters,
317.129	many of them new to the city.
319.637	With over 700 apartments, we wanted to see
319.637	if we could use architecture
323.587	to help people get to know
323.587	their neighbors,
325.682	even when their homes are organized
325.682	in the vertical dimension.
330.908	So we invented a way to use balconies
330.908	as the new social connectors.
335.389	The shapes of the floor slabs
335.389	vary slightly and they transition
338.953	as you go up the tower.
340.346	The result of this
340.346	is that you can actually see people
344.271	from your balcony.
345.64	The balconies are misregistered.
347.797	You can lean over your balcony
347.797	"and say, ""Hey!"""
349.965	just like you would across the backyard.
352.967	To make the balconies more comfortable
354.87	for a longer period of time
354.87	during the year,
357.171	we studied the wind
357.171	with digital simulations,
359.661	so the effect of the balcony shapes
359.661	breaks up the wind
362.547	and confuses the wind
363.882	and makes the balconies
363.882	more comfortable and less windy.
367.93	Now, just by being able
367.93	to go outside on your balcony
370.903	or on the third floor roof terrace,
373.002	you can be connected to the outdoors,
375.111	even when you're way above
375.111	the ground plane.
377.266	So the building acts to create community
380.025	within the building and the city
380.025	at the same time.
382.67	It's working.
384.683	And people are starting to meet each other
384.683	on the building surface
388.707	and we've heard --
389.887	(Laughter)
390.967	they've even starting getting
390.967	together as couples.
394.576	But besides romantic relationships,
397.227	the building has a positive social effect
399.491	on the community,
401.452	as evidenced by people
401.452	starting groups together
404.163	and starting big projects together,
406.033	like this organic community garden
406.033	on the building's roof terrace.
411.694	So I've shown how tall buildings
411.694	can be social connectors,
414.734	but what about public architecture?
416.75	How can we create better
416.75	social cohesion in public buildings
420.637	and civic spaces,
422.018	and why is it important?
423.89	Public architecture
423.89	is just not as successful
426.011	if it comes from the top down.
429.313	About 15 years ago in Chicago,
431.435	they started to replace
431.435	old police stations,
434.566	and they built this identical model
434.566	all over the city.
438.319	And even though they had good intentions
440.904	of treating all neighborhoods equally,
443.426	the communities didn't feel
443.426	invested in the process
445.87	or feel a sense of ownership
445.87	of these buildings.
448.408	It was equality in the sense that
448.408	everybody gets the same police station,
451.959	but it wasn't equity
451.959	in the sense of responding
455.337	to each community's individual needs.
457.719	And equity is the key issue here.
460.584	You know, in my field, there's a debate
464.008	about whether architecture
464.008	can even do anything
466.623	to improve social relationships.
468.832	But I believe that we need architecture
468.832	and every tool in our tool kit
474.29	to improve these relationships.
477.133	In the US, policy reforms
477.133	have been recommended
480.54	in order to rebuild trust.
482.368	But my team and I wondered
483.8	if design and a more inclusive
483.8	design process
486.863	could help add something positive
486.863	to this policy conversation.
490.54	We asked ourselves simply:
492.25	Can design help rebuild trust?
494.928	So we reached out to community members
494.928	and police officers in North Lawndale;
499.274	it's a neighborhood in Chicago
500.857	where the police station
500.857	is perceived as a scary fortress
503.697	surrounded by a parking lot.
506.074	In North Lawndale,
506.074	people are afraid of police
508.716	and of going anywhere
508.716	near the police station,
510.945	even to report a crime.
512.663	So we organized this brainstorming session
515.44	with both groups participating,
517.122	and we came up with this whole
517.122	new idea for the police station.
520.961	"It's called ""Polis Station."""
522.89	"""Polis"" is a Greek word that means"
522.89	a place with a sense of community.
528.348	It's based on the idea
529.992	that if you can increase opportunities
529.992	for positive social interactions
533.953	between police and community members,
536.27	you can rebuild that relationship
538.489	and activate the neighborhood
538.489	at the same time.
542.003	Instead of the police station
542.003	as a scary fortress,
545.132	you get highly active spaces
545.132	on the public side of the station --
549.613	places that spark conversation,
551.147	like a barbershop, a coffee shop
553.731	or sports courts as well.
555.328	Both cops and kids said they love sports.
558.159	These insights came directly
558.159	from the community members
561.574	and the police officers themselves,
563.93	and as designers, our role
563.93	was just to connect the dots
567.713	and suggest the first step.
569.673	So with the help
569.673	of the city and the parks,
572.311	we were able to raise funds
572.311	and design and build a half-court,
576.621	right on the police station parking lot.
578.985	It's a start.
580.45	But is it rebuilding trust?
582.674	The people in North Lawndale say
582.674	the kids are using the courts every day
586.274	and they even organize tournaments
586.274	like this one shown here,
589.647	and once in a while an officer joins in.
594.084	But now, they even have basketballs
594.084	inside the station
596.774	that kids can borrow.
598.063	And recently they've asked us
598.063	to expand the courts
600.579	and build a park on the site.
604.459	And parents report something astonishing.
607.311	Before, there was fear of going
607.311	anywhere the station, and now they say
611.566	there's a sense that the court is safer
611.566	than other courts nearby,
615.077	and they prefer their kids to play here.
618.097	So maybe in the future,
619.711	on the public side of the station,
621.381	you might be able to drop in
621.381	for a haircut at the barbershop
625.11	or reserve the community room
625.11	for a birthday party
627.783	or renew your driver's license
629.45	or get money out of an ATM.
632.024	It can be a place for neighbors
632.024	to meet each other
634.739	and to get to know
634.739	the officers, and vice versa.
638.601	This is not a utopian fantasy.
640.569	It's about how do you design
640.569	to rebuild trust,
644.581	trusting relationships?
646.829	You know, every city has parks,
646.829	libraries, schools
650.644	and other public buildings
652.062	that have the potential
652.062	to be reimagined as social connectors.
656.954	But reimagining the buildings
656.954	for the future is going to require
661.008	engaging the people who live there.
663.799	Engaging the public can be intimidating,
663.799	and I've felt that, too.
667.711	But maybe that's because
667.711	in architecture school,
670.016	we don't really learn how to engage
670.016	the public in the act of design.
674.047	We're taught to defend
674.047	our design against criticism.
677.594	But I think that can change, too.
680.813	So if we can focus the design mind
683.41	on creating positive,
683.41	reinforcing relationships
687.414	in architecture and through architecture,
689.418	I believe we can do much more
689.418	than create individual buildings.
694.065	We can reduce the stress
694.065	and the polarization
697.284	in our urban habitats.
700.1	We can create relationships.
701.989	We can help steady
701.989	this planet we all share.
705.962	See?
707.145	Architects really are
707.145	relationship builders.
709.408	(Laughter)
710.794	Thank you very much.
711.97	(Applause)
