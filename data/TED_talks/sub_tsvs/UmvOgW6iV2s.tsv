12.743	We always hear that texting is a scourge.
15.605	The idea is that texting spells the decline and fall
20.445	of any kind of serious literacy, or at least writing ability,
23.945	among young people in the United States
26.588	and now the whole world today.
28.889	The fact of the matter is that it just isn't true,
32.393	and it's easy to think that it is true,
34.896	but in order to see it in another way,
36.795	in order to see that actually texting is a miraculous thing,
40.464	not just energetic, but a miraculous thing,
43.029	a kind of emergent complexity
44.776	that we're seeing happening right now,
47.237	we have to pull the camera back for a bit
49.543	and look at what language really is,
52.961	in which case, one thing that we see
55.034	is that texting is not writing at all.
59.658	What do I mean by that?
61.48	Basically, if we think about language,
64.036	language has existed for perhaps 150,000 years,
67.837	at least 80,000 years,
69.974	and what it arose as is speech. People talked.
74.125	That's what we're probably genetically specified for.
77.149	That's how we use language most.
79.34	Writing is something that came along much later,
82.822	and as we saw in the last talk,
84.878	there's a little bit of controversy as to exactly when that happened,
87.546	but according to traditional estimates,
89.862	if humanity had existed for 24 hours,
93.384	then writing only came along at about 11:07 p.m.
98.575	That's how much of a latterly thing writing is.
102.22	So first there's speech, and then writing comes along
105.608	as a kind of artifice.
107.37	Now don't get me wrong, writing has certain advantages.
111.376	When you write, because it's a conscious process,
113.959	because you can look backwards,
116.097	you can do things with language that are much less likely
118.927	if you're just talking.
121.391	For example, imagine a passage from Edward Gibbon's
125.292	"""The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire:"""
129.098	"""The whole engagement lasted above twelve hours,"
132.349	till the graduate retreat of the Persians was changed
134.651	into a disorderly flight, of which the shameful example
137.424	"was given by the principal leaders and the Surenas himself."""
140.011	That's beautiful, but let's face it, nobody talks that way.
144.33	Or at least, they shouldn't if they're interested
148.566	in reproducing. That --
151.08	(Laughter)
153.799	is not the way any human being speaks casually.
156.777	Casual speech is something quite different.
159.362	Linguists have actually shown
161.218	that when we're speaking casually in an unmonitored way,
163.929	we tend to speak in word packets of maybe
166.607	seven to 10 words.
168.417	You'll notice this if you ever have occasion to record
171.096	yourself or a group of people talking.
174.089	That's what speech is like.
175.544	Speech is much looser. It's much more telegraphic.
179.849	It's much less reflective -- very different from writing.
183.539	So we naturally tend to think, because we see language
186.475	written so often, that that's what language is,
188.917	but actually what language is, is speech. They are two things.
192.885	Now of course, as history has gone by,
196.139	it's been natural for there to be a certain amount of bleed
198.93	between speech and writing.
201.944	So, for example, in a distant era now,
206.767	it was common when one gave a speech
209.269	to basically talk like writing.
212.386	So I mean the kind of speech that you see someone giving
214.736	in an old movie where they clear their throat, and they go,
217.269	"""Ahem, ladies and gentlemen,"" and then they speak"
219.802	in a certain way which has nothing to do with casual speech.
223.073	It's formal. It uses long sentences like this Gibbon one.
226.932	It's basically talking like you write, and so, for example,
230.894	we're thinking so much these days about Lincoln
232.889	because of the movie.
235.1	The Gettysburg Address was not the main meal of that event.
238.183	For two hours before that, Edward Everett spoke
242.098	on a topic that, frankly, cannot engage us today
245.338	and barely did then.
246.835	The point of it was to listen to him
249.216	speaking like writing.
250.772	Ordinary people stood and listened to that for two hours.
253.12	It was perfectly natural.
254.553	That's what people did then, speaking like writing.
257.044	Well, if you can speak like writing,
259.51	then logically it follows that you might want to also
263.308	sometimes write like you speak.
266.174	The problem was just that in the material,
268.224	mechanical sense, that was harder back in the day
271.679	for the simple reason that materials don't lend themselves to it.
274.986	It's almost impossible to do that with your hand
277.006	except in shorthand, and then communication is limited.
280.441	On a manual typewriter it was very difficult,
282.957	and even when we had electric typewriters,
285.244	or then computer keyboards, the fact is
287.403	that even if you can type easily enough to keep up
289.702	with the pace of speech, more or less, you have to have
292.495	somebody who can receive your message quickly.
294.84	Once you have things in your pocket that can receive that message,
298.051	then you have the conditions that allow
300.655	that we can write like we speak.
304.166	And that's where texting comes in.
307.384	And so, texting is very loose in its structure.
311.153	No one thinks about capital letters or punctuation when one texts,
315.45	but then again, do you think about those things when you talk?
317.808	No, and so therefore why would you when you were texting?
321.481	What texting is, despite the fact that it involves
324.61	the brute mechanics of something that we call writing,
327.436	is fingered speech. That's what texting is.
330.734	Now we can write the way we talk.
334.199	And it's a very interesting thing, but nevertheless
336.978	easy to think that still it represents some sort of decline.
341.834	We see this general bagginess of the structure,
345.118	the lack of concern with rules and the way that we're used to
348.467	learning on the blackboard, and so we think
350.739	that something has gone wrong.
353.978	It's a very natural sense.
356.941	But the fact of the matter is that what is going on
360.975	is a kind of emergent complexity.
364.546	That's what we're seeing in this fingered speech.
367.302	And in order to understand it, what we want to see
370.288	is the way, in this new kind of language,
375.033	there is new structure coming up.
378.609	And so, for example, there is in texting a convention,
384.332	which is LOL.
387.254	Now LOL, we generally think of
389.998	"as meaning ""laughing out loud."""
392.462	And of course, theoretically, it does,
394.755	and if you look at older texts, then people used it
397.184	to actually indicate laughing out loud.
399.704	But if you text now, or if you are someone who
403.947	is aware of the substrate of texting the way it's become,
407.244	you'll notice that LOL
408.934	does not mean laughing out loud anymore.
411.004	It's evolved into something that is much subtler.
414.794	This is an actual text that was done
418.241	by a non-male person of about 20 years old
422.173	not too long ago.
423.668	"""I love the font you're using, btw."""
426.62	"Julie: ""lol thanks gmail is being slow right now"""
430.382	Now if you think about it, that's not funny.
432.124	No one's laughing. (Laughter)
435.024	And yet, there it is, so you assume
436.994	there's been some kind of hiccup.
438.351	"Then Susan says ""lol, I know,"""
440.185	again more guffawing than we're used to
442.482	when you're talking about these inconveniences.
445.712	"So Julie says, ""I just sent you an email."""
448.456	"Susan: ""lol, I see it."""
450.007	Very funny people, if that's what LOL means.
453.625	"This Julie says, ""So what's up?"""
455.753	"Susan: ""lol, I have to write a 10 page paper."""
458.395	She's not amused. Let's think about it.
460.709	LOL is being used in a very particular way.
463.39	It's a marker of empathy. It's a marker of accommodation.
467.081	We linguists call things like that pragmatic particles.
470.33	Any spoken language that's used by real people has them.
474.169	If you happen to speak Japanese, think about
475.945	"that little word ""ne"" that you use at the end of a lot of sentences."
479.303	If you listen to the way black youth today speak,
481.648	"think about the use of the word ""yo."""
483.434	Whole dissertations could be written about it,
485.38	and probably are being written about it.
487.654	A pragmatic particle, that's what LOL has gradually become.
491.448	It's a way of using the language between actual people.
495.497	"Another example is ""slash."""
498.736	Now, we can use slash in the way that we're used to,
501.504	"along the lines of, ""We're going to have"
503.144	"a party-slash-networking session."""
506.626	That's kind of like what we're at.
508.72	Slash is used in a very different way
512.259	in texting among young people today.
515.217	It's used to change the scene.
517.07	So for example, this Sally person says,
520.019	"""So I need to find people to chill with"""
521.824	"and Jake says, ""Haha"" --"
523.343	"you could write a dissertation about ""Haha"" too, but we don't have time for that â€”"
526.231	"""Haha so you're going by yourself? Why?"""
528.72	"Sally: ""For this summer program at NYU."""
531.33	"Jake: ""Haha. Slash I'm watching this video with suns players"
534.224	"trying to shoot with one eye."""
536.021	The slash is interesting.
537.296	I don't really even know what Jake is talking about after that,
540.452	but you notice that he's changing the topic.
545.193	Now that seems kind of mundane,
547.011	but think about how in real life,
548.453	if we're having a conversation and we want to change the topic,
551.111	there are ways of doing it gracefully.
552.723	You don't just zip right into it.
554.442	You'll pat your thighs and look wistfully off into the distance,
558.637	"or you'll say something like, ""Hmm, makes you think --"""
562.747	when it really didn't, but what you're really --
565.107	(Laughter) â€”
567.342	what you're really trying to do is change the topic.
570.05	You can't do that while you're texting,
571.977	and so ways are developing of doing it within this medium.
575.708	All spoken languages have what a linguist calls
577.96	a new information marker -- or two, or three.
581.353	Texting has developed one from this slash.
585.647	So we have a whole battery of new constructions
588.632	that are developing, and yet it's easy to think,
591.219	well, something is still wrong.
593.666	There's a lack of structure of some sort.
597.441	It's not as sophisticated
599.347	as the language of The Wall Street Journal.
601.553	Well, the fact of the matter is,
603.327	look at this person in 1956,
605.778	and this is when texting doesn't exist,
608.06	"""I Love Lucy"" is still on the air."
609.895	"""Many do not know the alphabet or multiplication table,"
613.658	"cannot write grammatically -- """
614.995	We've heard that sort of thing before,
617.204	not just in 1956. 1917, Connecticut schoolteacher.
623.896	that everything somehow in terms of writing was perfect
627.147	"because the people on ""Downton Abbey"" are articulate,"
629.565	or something like that.
630.776	"So, ""From every college in the country goes up the cry,"
633.72	"'Our freshmen can't spell, can't punctuate.'"""
636.353	And so on. You can go even further back than this.
638.761	It's the President of Harvard. It's 1871.
641.945	There's no electricity. People have three names.
644.487	"""Bad spelling,"
646.912	"incorrectness as well as inelegance of expression in writing."""
650.18	And he's talking about people who are otherwise
652.329	well prepared for college studies.
654.22	You can go even further back.
659.919	"because of what he has for a long time ""noted with regret"
663.096	"the almost entire neglect of the original"" blah blah blah blah blah."
666.605	Or you can go all the way back to 63 A.D. -- (Laughter) --
671.893	and there's this poor man who doesn't like the way
674.274	people are speaking Latin.
675.495	As it happens, he was writing about what had become French.
678.651	And so, there are always â€” (Laughter) (Applause) â€”
685.053	there are always people worrying about these things
687.224	and the planet somehow seems to keep spinning.
690.497	And so, the way I'm thinking of texting these days is
695.144	that what we're seeing is a whole new way of writing
698.724	that young people are developing,
700.35	which they're using alongside their ordinary writing skills,
704.11	and that means that they're able to do two things.
707.277	Increasing evidence is that being bilingual
710.174	is cognitively beneficial.
712.407	That's also true of being bidialectal.
714.562	That's certainly true of being bidialectal in terms of your writing.
717.652	And so texting actually is evidence of a balancing act
722.57	that young people are using today, not consciously, of course,
725.872	but it's an expansion of their linguistic repertoire.
729.559	It's very simple.
730.788	If somebody from 1973 looked at
734.498	what was on a dormitory message board in 1993,
738.604	the slang would have changed a little bit
740.437	"since the era of ""Love Story,"""
742.255	but they would understand what was on that message board.
745.568	Take that person from 1993 -- not that long ago,
748.292	"this is ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" -- those people."
751.55	Take those people and they read
753.919	a very typical text written by a 20-year-old today.
756.819	Often they would have no idea what half of it meant
759.71	because a whole new language has developed
763.638	among our young people doing something as mundane
765.932	as what it looks like to us when they're batting around
768.203	on their little devices.
769.878	So in closing, if I could go into the future,
773.539	if I could go into 2033,
777.914	the first thing I would ask is whether David Simon
780.827	"had done a sequel to ""The Wire."" I would want to know."
784.72	And â€” I really would ask that â€”
787.703	"and then I'd want to know actually what was going on on ""Downton Abbey."""
790.793	That'd be the second thing.
792.302	And then the third thing would be,
794.838	please show me a sheaf of texts
798.029	written by 16-year-old girls,
799.986	because I would want to know where this language
802.44	had developed since our times,
804.395	and ideally I would then send them back to you and me now
808.028	so we could examine this linguistic miracle
810.548	happening right under our noses.
812.898	Thank you very much.
814.414	(Applause)
819.582	Thank you. (Applause)
