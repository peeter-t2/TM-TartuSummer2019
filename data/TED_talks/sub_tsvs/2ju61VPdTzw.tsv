12.498	One summer afternoon in 2013,
15.118	DC police detained, questioned
15.118	and searched a man
18.27	who appeared suspicious
18.27	and potentially dangerous.
22.136	This wasn't what I was wearing
22.136	the day of the detention, to be fair,
25.605	but I have a picture of that as well.
27.452	I know it's very frightening --
27.452	try to remain calm.
30.172	(Laughter)
31.289	At this time, I was interning
33.735	at the Public Defender Service
33.735	in Washington DC,
36.491	and I was visiting
36.491	a police station for work.
38.934	I was on my way out,
40.118	and before I could make it to my car,
42.134	two police cars pulled up
42.134	to block my exit,
44.459	and an officer approached me from behind.
46.814	He told me to stop, take my backpack off
49.11	and put my hands on the police car
49.11	parked next to us.
52.62	About a dozen officers
52.62	then gathered near us.
55.639	All of them had handguns,
56.91	some had assault rifles.
58.274	They rifled through my backpack.
60.032	They patted me down.
61.461	They took pictures of me
61.461	spread on the police car,
63.846	and they laughed.
65.026	And as all this was happening --
66.59	as I was on the police car trying
66.59	to ignore the shaking in my legs,
69.864	trying to think clearly
69.864	about what I should do --
72.223	something stuck out to me as odd.
74.246	When I look at myself in this photo,
76.264	if I were to describe myself,
78.123	I think I'd say something like,
79.934	"""19-year-old Indian male,"
79.934	"bright T-shirt, wearing glasses."""
85.347	But they weren't including
85.347	any of these details.
87.652	Into their police radios
87.652	as they described me,
89.926	"they kept saying, ""Middle Eastern"
89.926	male with a backpack.
92.582	"Middle Eastern male with a backpack."""
94.635	And this description carried on
94.635	into their police reports.
98.239	I never expected to be described
98.239	by my own government in these terms:
102.869	"""lurking,"""
105.121	"""nefarious,"""
107.652	"""terrorist."""
108.836	And the detention dragged on like this.
110.803	They sent dogs trained to smell explosives
110.803	to sweep the area I'd been in.
114.705	They called the federal government
114.705	to see if I was on any watch lists.
118.156	They sent a couple of detectives
118.156	to cross-examine me on why,
121.031	if I claimed I had nothing to hide,
123.171	I wouldn't consent to a search of my car.
125.241	And I could see
125.241	they weren't happy with me,
127.326	but I felt I had no way of knowing
127.326	what they'd want to do next.
130.433	At one point, the officer
130.433	who patted me down
133.354	scanned the side of the police station
133.354	to see where the security camera was
136.908	to see how much of this
136.908	was being recorded.
139.804	And when he did that,
140.996	it really sank in how completely
140.996	I was at their mercy.
144.49	I think we're all normalized
144.49	from a young age
146.937	to the idea of police officers
146.937	and arrests and handcuffs,
150.714	so it's easy to forget how demeaning
150.714	and coercive a thing it is
154.68	to seize control over
154.68	another person's body.
157.609	I know it sounds like
157.609	the point of my story
159.678	is how badly treated I was
159.678	because of my race --
162.144	and yes, I don't think I would've been
162.144	detained if I were white.
165.288	But actually, what I have in mind
165.288	today is something else.
168.051	What I have in mind is how
168.051	much worse things might've been
170.793	if I weren't affluent.
171.981	I mean, they thought I might be trying
171.981	to plant an explosive,
174.923	and they investigated that possibility
174.923	for an hour and a half,
178.116	but I was never put in handcuffs,
179.852	I was never taken to a jail cell.
181.888	I think if I were from one of Washington
181.888	DC's poor communities of color,
185.972	and they thought I was
185.972	endangering officers' lives,
188.419	things might've ended differently.
190.064	And in fact, in our system, I think
190.064	it's better to be an affluent person
193.492	suspected of trying
193.492	to blow up a police station
195.804	than it is to be a poor person
197.495	who's suspected of much,
197.495	much less than this.
200.176	I want to give you an example
200.176	from my current work.
203.129	Right now, I'm working
203.129	at a civil rights organization in DC,
206.403	called Equal Justice Under Law.
208.759	Let me start by asking you all a question.
211.692	How many of you have ever gotten
211.692	a parking ticket in your life?
214.703	Raise your hand.
215.891	Yeah. So have I.
217.861	And when I had to pay it,
219.218	it felt annoying and it felt bad,
221.273	but I paid it and I moved on.
223.213	I'm guessing most of you
223.213	have paid your tickets as well.
226.436	But what would happen if you
226.436	couldn't afford the amount on the ticket
230.747	and your family doesn't have
230.747	the money either, what happens then?
233.941	Well, one thing that's not supposed
233.941	to happen under the law is,
236.956	you're not supposed to be
236.956	arrested and jailed
239.084	simply because you can't afford to pay.
241.204	That's illegal under federal law.
243.032	But that's what local governments
243.032	across the country are doing
245.984	to people who are poor.
247.165	And so many of our lawsuits
247.165	at Equal Justice Under Law
250.109	target these modern-day debtors' prisons.
253.591	One of our cases is against
253.591	Ferguson, Missouri.
256.336	And I know when I say Ferguson,
258.184	many of you will think of police violence.
260.306	But today I want to talk
260.306	about a different aspect
262.617	of the relationship between
262.617	their police force and their citizens.
266.107	Ferguson was issuing an average
266.107	of over two arrest warrants,
269.665	per person, per year,
271.696	mostly for unpaid debt to the courts.
274.816	When I imagine what that would feel like
274.816	if, every time I left my house,
278.863	there was a chance a police officer
278.863	would run my license plate,
281.987	see a warrant for unpaid debt,
283.702	seize my body they way the did in DC
285.856	and then take me to a jail cell,
287.797	I feel a little sick.
290.658	I've met many of the people in Ferguson
290.658	who have experienced this,
293.838	and I've heard some of their stories.
295.649	In Ferguson's jail,
297.041	in each small cell,
297.041	there's a bunk bed and a toilet,
300.174	but they'd pack four people
300.174	into each cell.
302.5	So there'd be two people on the bunks
302.5	and two people on the floor,
305.639	one with nowhere to go except
305.639	right next to the filthy toilet,
308.59	which was never cleaned.
309.774	In fact, the whole cell was never cleaned,
311.961	so the floor and the walls were lined
311.961	with blood and mucus.
315.908	No water to drink,
317.082	except coming out of a spigot
317.082	connected to the toilet.
319.81	The water looked and tasted dirty,
321.554	there was never enough food,
323.093	never any showers,
324.665	women menstruating
324.665	without any hygiene products,
327.479	no medical attention whatsoever.
329.197	When I asked a woman
329.197	about medical attention,
331.401	"she laughed, and she said, ""Oh, no, no."
333.82	The only attention you get
333.82	"from the guards in there is sexual."""
337.658	So, they'd take the debtors
337.658	to this place and they'd say,
340.402	"""We're not letting you leave"
340.402	"until you make a payment on your debt."""
343.962	And if you could -- if you
343.962	could call a family member
346.616	who could somehow come up with some money,
348.781	then maybe you were out.
350.198	If it was enough money, you were out.
352.381	But if it wasn't, you'd stay there
352.381	for days or weeks,
355.723	and every day the guards
355.723	would come down to the cells
358.533	and haggle with the debtors
358.533	about the price of release that day.
362.445	You'd stay until, at some point,
362.445	the jail would be booked to capacity,
366.591	and they'd want to book someone new in.
368.565	And at that point, they'd think,
370.15	"""OK, it's unlikely this person"
370.15	can come up with the money,
372.929	"it's more likely this new person will."""
374.813	You're out, they're in,
374.813	and the machine kept moving like that.
377.815	I met a man who,
379.865	nine years ago, was arrested
379.865	for panhandling in a Walgreens.
384.156	He couldn't afford his fines
384.156	and his court fees from that case.
388.236	When he was young
388.236	he survived a house fire,
391.256	only because he jumped out
391.256	of the third-story window to escape.
394.253	But that fall left him
394.253	with damage to his brain
396.478	and several parts of this body,
396.478	including his leg.
398.937	So he can't work,
400.12	and he relies on social security
400.12	payments to survive.
402.646	When I met him in his apartment,
404.356	he had nothing of value there --
404.356	not even food in his fridge.
407.259	He's chronically hungry.
408.448	He had nothing of value in his apartment
408.448	except a small piece of cardboard
411.951	on which he'd written
411.951	the names of his children.
414.209	He cherished this a lot.
414.209	He was happy to show it to me.
416.811	But he can't pay his fines and fees
416.811	because he has nothing to give.
419.995	In the last nine years,
419.995	he's been arrested 13 times,
423.385	and jailed for a total of 130 days
423.385	on that panhandling case.
428.479	One of those stretches lasted 45 days.
431.551	Just imagine spending from right now
431.551	until sometime in June
435.981	in the place that I described to you
435.981	a few moments ago.
440.436	He told me about all the suicide attempts
440.436	he's seen in Ferguson's jail;
444.541	about the time a man found
444.541	a way to hang himself
446.838	out of reach of the other inmates,
448.522	so all they could do
448.522	was yell and yell and yell,
451.708	trying to get the guards' attention
453.472	so they could come down and cut him down.
455.489	And he told me that it took the guards
455.489	over five minutes to respond,
458.949	and when they came,
458.949	the man was unconscious.
461.241	So they called the paramedics
461.241	and the paramedics went to the cell.
464.436	"They said, ""He'll be OK,"""
465.792	so they just left him there on the floor.
468.02	I heard many stories like this
468.02	and they shouldn't have surprised me,
471.338	because suicide is the single leading
471.338	cause of death in our local jails.
475.672	This is related to the lack
475.672	of mental health care in our jails.
478.683	I met a woman, single mother of three,
478.683	making seven dollars an hour.
482.627	She relies on food stamps
482.627	to feed herself and her children.
485.928	About a decade ago,
487.496	she got a couple of traffic tickets
487.496	and a minor theft charge,
491.285	and she can't afford her fines
491.285	and fees on those cases.
494.546	Since then, she's been jailed
494.546	about 10 times on those cases,
498.07	but she has schizophrenia
498.07	and bipolar disorder,
500.377	and she needs medication every day.
502.552	She doesn't have access
502.552	to those medications in Ferguson's jail,
505.614	because no one has access
505.614	to their medications.
507.854	She told me about what it was like
507.854	to spend two weeks in a cage,
511.904	hallucinating people and shadows
511.904	and hearing voices,
515.481	begging for the medication
515.481	that would make it all stop,
518.099	only to be ignored.
520.19	And this isn't anomalous, either:
522.06	thirty percent of women in our local jails
522.06	have serious mental health needs
525.609	just like hers,
526.789	but only one in six receives
526.789	any mental health care while in jail.
531.33	And so, I heard all these stories
531.33	about this grotesque dungeon
535.179	that Ferguson was operating
535.179	for its debtors,
537.401	and when it came time
537.401	for me to actually see it
539.718	and to go visit Ferguson's jail,
541.696	I'm not sure what I was expecting to see,
543.76	but I wasn't expecting this.
546.315	It's an ordinary government building.
548.178	It could be a post office or a school.
550.658	It reminded me that these illegal
550.658	extortion schemes
554.374	aren't being run somewhere in the shadows,
556.486	they're being run out in the open
556.486	by our public officials.
559.226	They're a matter of public policy.
560.95	And this reminded me
560.95	that poverty jailing in general,
563.813	even outside the debtors' prison context,
566.045	plays a very visible and central role
566.045	in our justice system.
569.638	What I have in mind is our policy of bail.
571.874	In our system, whether
571.874	you're detained or free,
574.45	pending trial is not a matter
574.45	of how dangerous you are
577.604	or how much of a flight risk you pose.
579.876	It's a matter of whether you can afford
579.876	to post your bail amount.
582.986	So Bill Cosby, whose bail
582.986	was set at a million dollars,
585.722	immediately writes the check,
585.722	and doesn't spend a second in a jail cell.
589.206	But Sandra Bland, who died in jail,
590.962	was only there because her family
590.962	was unable to come up with 500 dollars.
594.984	In fact, there are half a million
594.984	Sandra Blands across the country --
600.685	only because they can't afford
600.685	their bail amount.
603.37	We're told that our jails
603.37	are places for criminals,
606.451	but statistically that's not the case:
608.488	three out of every five people
608.488	in jail right now are there pretrial.
612.813	They haven't been convicted of any crime;
615.019	they haven't pled guilty to any offense.
618.171	Right here in San Francisco,
	in our jail in San Francisco
622.953	are pretrial detainees.
624.721	This means San Francisco is spending
624.721	something like 80 million dollars
628.13	every year
629.324	to fund pretrial detention.
633.06	Many of these people who are in jail
633.06	only because they can't post bail
637.503	are facing allegations so minor
639.773	that the amount of time it would take
639.773	for them to sit waiting for trial
643.18	is longer than the sentence
643.18	they would receive if convicted,
646.256	which means they're guaranteed
646.256	to get out faster
648.548	if they just plead guilty.
649.856	So now the choice is:
651.439	Should I stay here in this horrible place,
654.336	away from my family and my dependents,
656.47	almost guaranteed to lose my job,
658.971	and then fight the charges?
660.616	Or should I just plead guilty to whatever
660.616	the prosecutor wants and get out?
664.209	And at this point, they're pretrial
664.209	detainees, not criminals.
667.168	But once they take that plea deal,
667.168	we'll call them criminals,
670.084	even though an affluent person
670.084	would never have been in this situation,
673.488	because an affluent person
673.488	would have simply been bailed out.
676.386	At this point you might be wondering,
678.5	"""This guy's in the inspiration section,"
678.5	what is he doing --
681.318	(Laughter)
682.502	"""This is extremely depressing."
682.502	"I want my money back."""
685.332	(Laughter)
686.562	But in actuality,
688.985	I find talking about jailing much less
688.985	depressing than the alternative,
693.399	because I think if we don't talk
693.399	about these issues
695.859	and collectively change
695.859	how we think about jailing,
698.284	at the end of all of our lives,
699.812	we'll still have jails full of poor people
699.812	who don't belong there.
702.967	That really is depressing to me.
704.545	But what's exciting to me is the thought
704.545	that these stories can move us
707.993	to think about jailing in different terms.
710.06	Not in sterile policy terms
710.06	"like ""mass incarceration,"""
713.455	"or ""sentencing of nonviolent offenders,"""
715.465	but in human terms.
716.655	When we put a human being in a cage
716.655	for days or weeks or months
721.264	or even years,
722.732	what are we doing
722.732	to that person's mind and body?
725.105	Under what conditions
725.105	are we really willing to do that?
728.389	And so if starting with a few
728.389	hundred of us in this room,
731.219	we can commit to thinking about
731.219	jailing in this different light,
734.287	then we can undo that normalization
734.287	I was referring to earlier.
737.791	If I leave you with anything today,
737.791	I hope it's with the thought
740.853	that if we want anything
740.853	to fundamentally change --
743.309	not just to reform our policies
743.309	on bail and fines and fees --
746.613	but also to make sure that whatever
746.613	new policies replace those
749.69	don't punish the poor and the marginalized
749.69	in their own new way.
752.765	If we want that kind of change,
754.421	then this shift in thinking
754.421	is required of each of us.
756.97	Thank you.
758.178	(Applause)
