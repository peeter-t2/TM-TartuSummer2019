12.519	Why do we think
14.423	that stories by men are deemed
14.423	to be of universal importance,
19.738	and stories by women are thought
19.738	to be merely about women?
26.633	My grandmother left school
26.633	when she was 12.
29.396	She had 14 children.
32.176	My mother left school when she was 15.
34.091	She was a secretary.
35.516	I graduated from university
35.516	to become a theater director,
39.298	and that progress is entirely to do
39.298	with the fact that people I'll never meet
43.481	fought for women to have rights,
45.753	get the vote, get education,
45.753	have progress.
48.918	And I'm determined to do the same,
48.918	and obviously you are, too.
52.527	Why not?
53.728	(Applause)
55.309	So I started a festival called WOW,
55.309	Women of the World, seven years ago,
59.045	and it's now in 20 countries
59.045	across five continents.
62.073	And one of those countries
62.073	is Somaliland in Africa.
65.448	So I traveled there last year,
67.687	and part of the joy I had in going there
67.687	was going to these caves.
74.542	The Laas Geel caves.
76.742	Now, these caves contain some
76.742	of the oldest cave paintings in the world.
82.819	These paintings are thought to be
82.819	round about 9,000 to 11,000 years old.
88.93	Art:
90.383	what humanity has done
90.383	ever since it evolved.
94.17	It's how we speak about ourselves,
96.317	how we understand our identity,
98.278	how we look at our surroundings,
100.05	who we find out about each other
103.145	because of the meaning of our lives.
105.379	That's what art is for.
107.791	So look at this little picture.
109.777	I think it's a little girl.
111.747	I thought it was a bit like me
111.747	when I was a little girl.
115.015	And I thought, well, who painted
115.015	this joyful, youthful figure?
119.206	And I asked the curator of the caves.
121.334	"I said, ""Tell me about the men"
121.334	"and women who painted these."""
124.876	And he looked at me
124.876	absolutely askance, and he said,
128.377	"""Women didn't paint these pictures."""
131.061	"And I said, ""Well,"
131.061	"it was 11,000 years ago."""
133.589	"I said, ""How do you know?"""
135.072	(Laughter)
137.623	"And he said, ""Women don't do these things."
141.378	"Men made these marks. Women don't."""
146.367	Now, I wasn't really surprised,
150.161	because that's an attitude
150.161	that I've seen continuously
154.243	all my life as a theater maker.
158.372	We are told that divine knowledge
158.372	comes down through the masculine,
164.206	whether it be to the imam,
164.206	the priest, the rabbi, the holy man.
169.241	Similarly, we're told that creative genius
169.241	resides in the masculine,
174.561	that it is the masculine
176.331	that will be able to tell us
176.331	about who we really are,
179.42	that the masculine will tell
179.42	the universal story
182.511	on behalf of all of us,
184.422	whereas women artists will really
184.422	just talk about women's experiences,
189.021	women's issues
189.021	only really relevant to women
192.421	and of passing interest to men --
195.423	and really only some men.
197.729	And it's that conviction,
200.024	that that we are taught,
201.429	that I think colors so much
201.429	of whether we're prepared to believe
205.253	that women's stories really matter.
207.778	And unless we're prepared to believe
207.778	that women's stories really matter,
211.349	then women's rights don't really matter,
214.363	and then change can't really come.
218.696	I want to tell you
218.696	about two examples of stories
223.43	that are thought to be
223.43	of universal importance:
226.392	"""E.T."" and ""Hamlet."""
229.172	(Laughter)
232.307	So I took my two children
232.307	when they were little --
235.597	Caroline was eight and Robby was five --
238.871	"to see ""E.T."""
240.462	And it's a fantastic story
240.462	of this little alien
243.871	who ends up in an American family
245.846	with a mum, two brothers and a sister,
249.079	but he wants to go home.
251.54	Not only that, but some
251.54	really bad scientists
254.184	want to do some experiments on him,
256.582	and they're looking for him.
258.813	So the children have a plot.
260.893	They decide they're going to take him
260.893	back to his spaceship
263.754	as soon as they can,
264.929	and they plop him in a bicycle basket,
266.827	and off they ride.
268.193	But unfortunately, the baddies
268.193	have found out, and they're catching up
272.113	and they've got sirens
272.113	and they've got their guns,
274.494	they've got the loud-hailers,
274.494	it's terribly frightening,
277.192	and they're closing up on the children,
279.136	and the children are never
279.136	going to make it.
281.256	And then all of a sudden, magically,
281.256	the bikes fly up in the air,
285.373	over the clouds,
286.936	over the moon,
288.148	"and they're going to save ""E.T."""
291.214	So I turn to see my children's faces,
293.516	and Robby is enraptured,
293.516	he's there with them, he's saving E.T.,
298.01	he's a happy boy.
299.89	And I turn to Caroline,
299.89	and she's crying her eyes out.
303.686	"And I said, ""What's the matter?"""
305.255	"And she said, ""Why can't I save E.T.?"
305.255	"Why can't I come?"""
311.242	And then all of a sudden I realized:
313.625	they weren't children;
315.677	they were boys --
317.575	all boys.
319.664	And Caroline, who had invested
319.664	so much in E.T.,
322.665	well, she wasn't invited to save him,
324.859	and she felt humiliated and spurned.
328.232	So I wrote to Steven Spielberg --
330.005	(Laughter) (Applause)
336.197	"and I said, ""I don't know"
336.197	if you understand
338.771	the psychological importance
338.771	of what's happened,
341.174	and are you prepared to pay
341.174	"for the therapy bills?"""
343.698	(Laughter)
345.136	Twenty years later, I haven't
345.136	had a word back from him,
348.132	but I'm still hopeful.
349.594	(Laughter)
351.228	But I thought it was interesting,
352.856	because if you read reviews
352.856	of what he intended with E.T.,
355.752	he says very specifically,
357.567	"""I wanted the world to understand"
360.093	that we should love
360.093	"and embrace difference."""
363.324	But somehow he didn't include
363.324	the idea of girls' difference
367.97	in this thinking.
369.686	He thought he was writing a story
369.686	about all humanity.
374.02	Caroline thought he was marginalizing
376.122	half of humanity.
377.575	He thought he was writing a story
377.575	about human goodness;
380.683	she thought he was writing
380.683	a lad's heroic adventure.
385.848	And this is common.
388.332	Men feel they have been given the mantle
388.332	for universal communication,
393.477	but of course, how could they be?
395.453	They are writing from male experience
395.453	through male's eyes.
401.851	We have to have a look at this ourselves.
404.093	We have to be prepared to go back
404.093	through all our books and our films,
407.793	all our favorite things,
409.154	"and say, ""Actually, this is written"
409.154	by a male artist --
412.008	not an artist.
414.02	We have to see
414.02	that so many of these stories
416.448	are written through a male perspective.
418.608	Which is fine,
420.569	but then females need to have
424.091	for the stage, the film, the novel,
426.669	the place of creativity.
429.381	"Let me talk about ""Hamlet."""
431.204	To be or not to be.
432.921	That is the question.
434.818	But it's not my question.
436.607	My question is: Why was I taught
436.607	as a young woman
440.38	that this was the quintessential
440.38	example of human dilemma
444.761	and human experience?
446.481	It's a marvelous story,
447.841	but actually, it's about a young man
447.841	fearful that he won't be able to make it
453.201	as a powerful figure in a male world
455.89	unless he takes revenge
455.89	for his father's murder.
459.372	He talks a great deal to us
459.372	about suicide being an option,
464.074	but the reality is that the person
464.074	who actually commits suicide, Ophelia,
468.767	after she's been humiliated
468.767	and abused by him,
471.289	never gets a chance to talk
471.289	to the audience about her feelings.
474.489	And then when he's finished with Ophelia,
474.489	he turns on his mum,
477.455	because basically she has the audacity
477.455	to fall in love with his uncle
480.778	and enjoy sex.
482.014	(Laughter)
484.075	It is a great story,
486.187	but it is a story about male conflict,
486.187	male dilemma, male struggle.
491.957	But I was told this was the story
491.957	of human beings,
496.173	despite the fact that it only
496.173	had two women in it.
499.24	And unless I reeducate myself,
501.825	I am always going to think
503.574	that women's stories
503.574	matter less than men's.
507.986	"A woman could have written ""Hamlet,"""
509.745	but she would have written it differently,
511.856	and it wouldn't have had
511.856	global recognition.
514.488	As the writer Margaret Atwood says,
516.583	"""When a man writes about doing the dishes,"
519.093	it's realism.
521.199	When a woman writes about doing it,
523.344	"it's an unfortunate genetic disposition."""
525.883	(Laughter)
527.116	Now, this is not just something
527.116	that belongs to then.
530.974	I mean, when I was a young girl,
532.798	wanting desperately
532.798	to be a theater director,
535.446	this is what my male lecturer said to me:
538.309	"""Well, there are three women"
538.309	"directors in Britain,"" he said, ""Jude."""
542.405	"""There's Joan Knight, who's a lesbian,"
542.405	there's Joan Littlewood, who's retired,
546.536	and there's Buzz Goodbody,
546.536	who's just killed herself.
549.34	So, which of those three
549.34	"would you like to be?"""
551.62	(Laughter)
552.697	Now, leaving aside
552.697	the disgusting slur on gay women,
557.307	the fact is, he wanted to humiliate me.
560.176	He thought it was silly
560.176	that I wanted to be a director.
563.959	And I told my friend Marin Alsop,
563.959	the conductor, and she said,
566.954	"""Oh yes, well, my music teacher"
566.954	said exactly the same.
569.727	"He said, 'Women don't conduct.'"""
572.524	But all these years later,
572.524	we've made our mark.
575.271	"You think, ""Well, it'll be different now."""
577.525	I'm afraid it's not different now.
580.043	The current head
580.043	of the Paris Conservatoire
583.512	"said recently, ""It takes"
583.512	great physical strength
586.963	to conduct a symphony,
588.468	"and women are too weak."""
589.943	(Laughter)
591.42	The artist George Baselitz said,
593.383	"""Well, the fact is women can't paint."
595.694	"Well -- they can't paint very well."""
598.014	The writer V.S. Naipaul
598.014	said two years ago,
600.426	"""I can read two paragraphs and know"
600.426	immediately if it's written by a woman,
604.042	and I just stop reading,
604.042	"because it's not worthy of me."""
606.767	Audience: Whoa!
609.209	And it goes on.
612.817	We have to find a way
614.829	of stopping young girls and women
617.497	feeling not only that
617.497	their story doesn't matter,
620.362	but they're not allowed
620.362	to be the storyteller.
624.481	Because once you feel
624.481	that you can't stand in the central space
628.088	and speak on behalf of the world,
631.12	you will feel that you can offer
631.12	your goods up to a small, select group.
636.219	You will tend to do smaller work
636.219	on smaller stages,
639.759	your economic power will be less,
641.816	your reach of audiences will be less,
644.312	and your credit will be less as an artist.
649.377	And we do finally give artists
649.377	these incredible, prominent spaces
654.656	in the world,
655.844	because they are our storytellers.
657.607	Now, why should it matter to you
657.607	if you're not an artist?
660.76	Supposing you're an accountant
660.76	or an entrepreneur or a medic
664.029	or a scientist:
665.22	Should you care about women artists?
667.846	Absolutely, you must,
669.926	because as you can see
669.926	from the cave paintings,
673.362	all civilizations,
675.067	all of humanity
677.925	have relied upon artists
677.925	to tell the human story,
681.905	and if the human story
681.905	is finally told by men,
685.198	take my word for it,
686.958	it will be about men.
689.491	So let's make a change.
692.199	Let's make a change
692.199	to all our institutions,
694.425	and not just in the West.
695.724	Don't forget -- this message
695.724	of incapability of women
700.167	to hold creative genius
702.216	is being told to girls and women
702.216	in Nigeria, in China, in Russia,
707.154	in Indonesia.
708.341	All over the world, girls
708.341	and women are being told
711.074	that they can't finally hold the idea
711.074	of creative inspiration.
716.951	And I want to ask you:
718.624	Do you believe that?
720.362	Do you believe that women
720.362	can be a creative genius?
724.988	(Applause and cheers)
730.751	Well then, please go forward,
732.436	support women artists,
734.71	buy their work,
736.208	insist that their voices are heard,
738.5	find platforms on which
738.5	their voices will be made.
742.5	And remember this:
744.311	that in a sense, if we're going
744.311	to get past this moment
747.614	of a world where we know
747.614	that we are unequal,
751.49	it's artists who have to imagine
751.49	a different world.
754.711	And I'm calling on all artists,
754.711	women and men,
758.345	to imagine a gender-equal world.
762.146	Let's paint it. Let's draw it.
764.353	Let's write about it. Let's film it.
766.172	And if we could imagine it,
768.082	then we would have the energy
768.082	and the stamina
771.586	to work towards it.
773.622	When I see this little girl,
777.764	I want to know that the little girl now
781.249	can stand there and think
781.249	she's entitled to her dreams,
784.557	she's entitled to her destiny
786.871	and she's entitled to speak
786.871	on behalf of the whole world,
791.097	be recognized for it
792.945	and applauded.
794.619	Thank you.
795.829	(Applause)
