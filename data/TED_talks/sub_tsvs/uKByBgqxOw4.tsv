12.562	I'm going to talk about the strategizing brain.
14.815	We're going to use an unusual combination of tools
17.053	from game theory and neuroscience
19.066	to understand how people interact socially when value is on the line.
22.033	So game theory is a branch of, originally, applied mathematics,
26.004	used mostly in economics and political science, a little bit in biology,
28.99	that gives us a mathematical taxonomy of social life
32.279	and it predicts what people are likely to do
34.41	and believe others will do
35.604	in cases where everyone's actions affect everyone else.
38.994	That's a lot of things: competition, cooperation, bargaining,
42.472	games like hide-and-seek, and poker.
45.763	Here's a simple game to get us started.
48.002	Everyone chooses a number from zero to 100,
50.164	we're going to compute the average of those numbers,
52.61	and whoever's closest to two-thirds of the average wins a fixed prize.
56.804	So you want to be a little bit below the average number,
59.073	but not too far below, and everyone else wants to be
61.309	a little bit below the average number as well.
63.254	Think about what you might pick.
65.833	As you're thinking, this is a toy model of something like
69.104	selling in the stock market during a rising market. Right?
71.916	You don't want to sell too early, because you miss out on profits,
74.141	but you don't want to wait too late
76.321	to when everyone else sells, triggering a crash.
78.722	You want to be a little bit ahead of the competition, but not too far ahead.
81.601	Okay, here's two theories about how people might think about this,
85.214	and then we'll see some data.
86.61	Some of these will sound familiar because you probably are
88.801	thinking that way. I'm using my brain theory to see.
92.6	"A lot of people say, ""I really don't know what people are going to pick,"
95.71	"so I think the average will be 50."""
97.383	They're not being really strategic at all.
99.294	"""And I'll pick two-thirds of 50. That's 33."" That's a start."
102.646	Other people who are a little more sophisticated,
104.538	using more working memory,
106.014	"say, ""I think people will pick 33 because they're going to pick a response to 50,"
109.918	"and so I'll pick 22, which is two-thirds of 33."""
112.886	They're doing one extra step of thinking, two steps.
115.365	That's better. And of course, in principle,
117.982	you could do three, four or more,
119.809	but it starts to get very difficult.
121.678	Just like in language and other domains, we know that it's hard for people to parse
124.27	very complex sentences with a kind of recursive structure.
127.904	This is called a cognitive hierarchy theory, by the way.
129.638	It's something that I've worked on and a few other people,
132.194	and it indicates a kind of hierarchy along with
134.414	some assumptions about how many people stop at different steps
136.668	and how the steps of thinking are affected
138.552	by lots of interesting variables and variant people, as we'll see in a minute.
142.248	A very different theory, a much more popular one, and an older one,
145.634	"due largely to John Nash of ""A Beautiful Mind"" fame,"
149.174	is what's called equilibrium analysis.
151.414	So if you've ever taken a game theory course at any level,
153.868	you will have learned a little bit about this.
155.581	An equilibrium is a mathematical state in which everybody
158.436	has figured out exactly what everyone else will do.
160.885	It is a very useful concept, but behaviorally,
162.892	it may not exactly explain what people do
164.895	the first time they play these types of economic games
167.63	or in situations in the outside world.
169.963	In this case, the equilibrium makes a very bold prediction,
172.301	which is everyone wants to be below everyone else,
175.161	therefore they'll play zero.
177.452	Let's see what happens. This experiment's been done many, many times.
180.461	Some of the earliest ones were done in the '90s
182.344	by me and Rosemarie Nagel and others.
184.989	This is a beautiful data set of 9,000 people who wrote in
187.974	to three newspapers and magazines that had a contest.
190.854	The contest said, send in your numbers
192.668	and whoever is close to two-thirds of the average will win a big prize.
195.823	And as you can see, there's so much data here, you can see the spikes very visibly.
198.911	There's a spike at 33. Those are people doing one step.
202.292	There is another spike visible at 22.
204.789	And notice, by the way, that most people pick numbers right around there.
207.081	They don't necessarily pick exactly 33 and 22.
209.591	There's something a little bit noisy around it.
211.647	But you can see those spikes, and they're there.
213.125	There's another group of people who seem to have
214.835	a firm grip on equilibrium analysis,
216.91	because they're picking zero or one.
219.305	But they lose, right?
221.394	Because picking a number that low is actually a bad choice
224.586	if other people aren't doing equilibrium analysis as well.
227.406	So they're smart, but poor.
229.518	(Laughter)
231.606	Where are these things happening in the brain?
233.575	One study by Coricelli and Nagel gives a really sharp, interesting answer.
237.45	So they had people play this game
238.958	while they were being scanned in an fMRI,
241.175	and two conditions: in some trials,
243.446	they're told you're playing another person
244.961	who's playing right now and we're going to match up
246.549	your behavior at the end and pay you if you win.
248.753	In the other trials, they're told, you're playing a computer.
250.731	They're just choosing randomly.
252.365	So what you see here is a subtraction
254.442	of areas in which there's more brain activity
257.192	when you're playing people compared to playing the computer.
260.168	And you see activity in some regions we've seen today,
262.159	medial prefrontal cortex, dorsomedial, however, up here,
265.396	ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
267.247	anterior cingulate, an area that's involved
268.601	"in lots of types of conflict resolution, like if you're playing ""Simon Says,"""
272.238	and also the right and left temporoparietal junction.
276.052	And these are all areas which are fairly reliably known
278.518	"to be part of what's called a ""theory of mind"" circuit,"
280.839	"or ""mentalizing circuit."""
282.74	That is, it's a circuit that's used to imagine what other people might do.
286.118	So these were some of the first studies to see this
288.358	tied in to game theory.
290.391	What happens with these one- and two-step types?
292.631	So we classify people by what they picked,
294.702	and then we look at the difference between
296.369	playing humans versus playing computers,
298.344	which brain areas are differentially active.
300.235	On the top you see the one-step players.
301.987	There's almost no difference.
303.507	The reason is, they're treating other people like a computer, and the brain is too.
306.447	The bottom players, you see all the activity in dorsomedial PFC.
310.588	So we know that those two-step players are doing something differently.
312.639	"Now if you were to step back and say, ""What can we do with this information?"""
315.735	you might be able to look at brain activity and say,
317.556	"""This person's going to be a good poker player,"""
319.055	"or, ""This person's socially naive,"""
320.984	and we might also be able to study things
322.262	like development of adolescent brains
323.86	once we have an idea of where this circuitry exists.
327.214	Okay. Get ready.
329.826	I'm saving you some brain activity,
331.949	because you don't need to use your hair detector cells.
334.759	You should use those cells to think carefully about this game.
337.647	This is a bargaining game.
339.582	Two players who are being scanned using EEG electrodes
342.138	are going to bargain over one to six dollars.
345.015	If they can do it in 10 seconds, they're going to actually earn that money.
347.679	If 10 seconds goes by and they haven't made a deal, they get nothing.
350.719	That's kind of a mistake together.
352.402	The twist is that one player, on the left,
355.219	is informed about how much on each trial there is.
357.907	They play lots of trials with different amounts each time.
360.139	In this case, they know there's four dollars.
362.38	The uninformed player doesn't know,
364.257	but they know that the informed player knows.
366.311	So the uninformed player's challenge is to say,
368.37	"""Is this guy really being fair"
369.84	or are they giving me a very low offer
371.694	"in order to get me to think that there's only one or two dollars available to split?"""
374.772	in which case they might reject it and not come to a deal.
377.926	So there's some tension here between trying to get the most money
380.876	but trying to goad the other player into giving you more.
383.449	And the way they bargain is to point on a number line
385.779	that goes from zero to six dollars,
387.585	and they're bargaining over how much the uninformed player gets,
390.563	and the informed player's going to get the rest.
392.148	So this is like a management-labor negotiation
394.723	in which the workers don't know how much profits
397.456	the privately held company has, right,
400.123	and they want to maybe hold out for more money,
402.491	but the company might want to create the impression
404.327	"that there's very little to split: ""I'm giving you the most that I can."""
407.259	First some behavior. So a bunch of the subject pairs, they play face to face.
411.49	We have some other data where they play across computers.
413.326	That's an interesting difference, as you might imagine.
415.064	But a bunch of the face-to-face pairs
417.266	agree to divide the money evenly every single time.
420.959	Boring. It's just not interesting neurally.
423.865	It's good for them. They make a lot of money.
426.379	But we're interested in, can we say something about
429.051	when disagreements occur versus don't occur?
431.587	So this is the other group of subjects who often disagree.
433.944	So they have a chance of -- they bicker and disagree
436.712	and end up with less money.
438.019	"They might be eligible to be on ""Real Housewives,"" the TV show."
441.936	You see on the left,
443.872	when the amount to divide is one, two or three dollars,
446.536	they disagree about half the time,
448.184	and when the amount is four, five, six, they agree quite often.
450.376	This turns out to be something that's predicted
452.25	by a very complicated type of game theory
454.454	you should come to graduate school at CalTech and learn about.
457.263	It's a little too complicated to explain right now,
459.435	but the theory tells you that this shape kind of should occur.
462.851	Your intuition might tell you that too.
465.067	Now I'm going to show you the results from the EEG recording.
467.307	Very complicated. The right brain schematic
469.66	is the uninformed person, and the left is the informed.
472.523	Remember that we scanned both brains at the same time,
475.323	so we can ask about time-synced activity
477.715	in similar or different areas simultaneously,
480.939	just like if you wanted to study a conversation
483.203	and you were scanning two people talking to each other
485.139	and you'd expect common activity in language regions
487.499	when they're actually kind of listening and communicating.
489.884	So the arrows connect regions that are active at the same time,
493.811	and the direction of the arrows flows
495.851	from the region that's active first in time,
498.331	and the arrowhead goes to the region that's active later.
501.899	So in this case, if you look carefully,
504.115	most of the arrows flow from right to left.
505.972	That is, it looks as if the uninformed brain activity
509.252	is happening first,
511.211	and then it's followed by activity in the informed brain.
514.726	And by the way, these were trials where their deals were made.
518.418	This is from the first two seconds.
520.198	We haven't finished analyzing this data,
522.178	so we're still peeking in, but the hope is
524.078	that we can say something in the first couple of seconds
526.642	about whether they'll make a deal or not,
528.365	which could be very useful in thinking about avoiding litigation
530.408	and ugly divorces and things like that.
532.336	Those are all cases in which a lot of value is lost
535.219	by delay and strikes.
538.195	Here's the case where the disagreements occur.
540.225	You can see it looks different than the one before.
542.398	There's a lot more arrows.
544.647	That means that the brains are synced up
546.158	more closely in terms of simultaneous activity,
548.71	and the arrows flow clearly from left to right.
550.72	That is, the informed brain seems to be deciding,
552.962	"""We're probably not going to make a deal here."""
555.25	And then later there's activity in the uninformed brain.
558.475	Next I'm going to introduce you to some relatives.
560.978	They're hairy, smelly, fast and strong.
563.239	You might be thinking back to your last Thanksgiving.
566.429	Maybe if you had a chimpanzee with you.
569.122	Charles Darwin and I and you broke off from the family tree
572.583	from chimpanzees about five million years ago.
574.842	They're still our closest genetic kin.
576.81	We share 98.8 percent of the genes.
578.547	We share more genes with them than zebras do with horses.
581.347	And we're also their closest cousin.
583.064	They have more genetic relation to us than to gorillas.
586.066	So how humans and chimpanzees behave differently
588.594	might tell us a lot about brain evolution.
591.049	So this is an amazing memory test
593.65	from Nagoya, Japan, Primate Research Institute,
596.466	where they've done a lot of this research.
598.244	This goes back quite a ways. They're interested in working memory.
600.584	The chimp is going to see, watch carefully,
602.356	they're going to see 200 milliseconds' exposure
604.558	— that's fast, that's eight movie frames —
606.552	of numbers one, two, three, four, five.
608.503	Then they disappear and they're replaced by squares,
610.501	and they have to press the squares
612.256	that correspond to the numbers from low to high
614.577	to get an apple reward.
615.916	Let's see how they can do it.
628.391	This is a young chimp. The young ones
629.884	are better than the old ones, just like humans.
632.667	And they're highly experienced, so they've done this
634.259	thousands and thousands of time.
635.691	Obviously there's a big training effect, as you can imagine.
639.928	(Laughter)
641.272	You can see they're very blasé and kind of effortless.
643.207	Not only can they do it very well, they do it in a sort of lazy way.
647.135	Right? Who thinks you could beat the chimps?
650.57	Wrong. (Laughter)
652.166	We can try. We'll try. Maybe we'll try.
654.604	Okay, so the next part of this study
657.194	I'm going to go quickly through
658.79	is based on an idea of Tetsuro Matsuzawa.
661.482	He had a bold idea that -- what he called the cognitive trade-off hypothesis.
664.511	We know chimps are faster and stronger.
665.803	They're also very obsessed with status.
667.483	His thought was, maybe they've preserved brain activities
670.439	and they practice them in development
672.607	that are really, really important to them
674.458	to negotiate status and to win,
676.668	which is something like strategic thinking during competition.
679.666	So we're going to check that out
681.246	by having the chimps actually play a game
683.676	by touching two touch screens.
686.314	The chimps are actually interacting with each other through the computers.
688.754	They're going to press left or right.
690.362	One chimp is called a matcher.
692.475	They win if they press left, left,
694.458	like a seeker finding someone in hide-and-seek, or right, right.
697.627	The mismatcher wants to mismatch.
698.855	They want to press the opposite screen of the chimp.
701.931	And the rewards are apple cube rewards.
704.475	So here's how game theorists look at these data.
707.003	This is a graph of the percentage of times
708.617	the matcher picked right on the x-axis,
711.235	and the percentage of times they predicted right
712.751	by the mismatcher on the y-axis.
715.619	So a point here is the behavior by a pair of players,
718.819	one trying to match, one trying to mismatch.
721.035	The NE square in the middle -- actually NE, CH and QRE --
724.315	those are three different theories of Nash equilibrium, and others,
726.771	tells you what the theory predicts,
729.195	which is that they should match 50-50,
731.467	because if you play left too much, for example,
733.635	I can exploit that if I'm the mismatcher by then playing right.
736.351	And as you can see, the chimps, each chimp is one triangle,
739.115	are circled around, hovering around that prediction.
742.962	Now we move the payoffs.
744.736	We're actually going to make the left, left payoff for the matcher a little bit higher.
748.179	Now they get three apple cubes.
749.699	Game theoretically, that should actually make the mismatcher's behavior shift,
752.499	because what happens is, the mismatcher will think,
754.089	oh, this guy's going to go for the big reward,
755.899	and so I'm going to go to the right, make sure he doesn't get it.
758.964	And as you can see, their behavior moves up
760.629	in the direction of this change in the Nash equilibrium.
764.077	Finally, we changed the payoffs one more time.
766.391	Now it's four apple cubes,
767.583	and their behavior again moves towards the Nash equilibrium.
769.755	It's sprinkled around, but if you average the chimps out,
771.79	they're really, really close, within .01.
773.98	They're actually closer than any species we've observed.
777.179	What about humans? You think you're smarter than a chimpanzee?
780.372	Here's two human groups in green and blue.
783.939	They're closer to 50-50. They're not responding to payoffs as closely,
787.683	and also if you study their learning in the game,
789.133	they aren't as sensitive to previous rewards.
791.118	The chimps are playing better than the humans,
792.482	better in the sense of adhering to game theory.
794.905	And these are two different groups of humans
796.324	from Japan and Africa. They replicate quite nicely.
799.52	None of them are close to where the chimps are.
802.755	So here are some things we learned today.
804.51	People seem to do a limited amount of strategic thinking
806.448	using theory of mind.
808.259	We have some preliminary evidence from bargaining
810.176	that early warning signs in the brain might be used to predict
812.668	whether there will be a bad disagreement that costs money,
814.894	and chimps are better competitors than humans,
816.734	as judged by game theory.
819.198	Thank you.
821.055	(Applause)
