12.18	I have a confession to make.
13.519	I'm a business professor
15.309	whose ambition has been
15.309	to help people learn to lead.
17.839	But recently, I've discovered
19.28	that what many of us
19.28	think of as great leadership
22.239	does not work when it comes
22.239	to leading innovation.
25.519	I'm an ethnographer.
26.92	I use the methods of anthropology
28.64	to understand the questions
28.64	in which I'm interested.
31.22	So along with three co-conspirators,
33.38	I spent nearly a decade observing
33.38	up close and personal
37.2	exceptional leaders of innovation.
39.679	We studied 16 men and women,
41.88	located in seven countries
41.88	across the globe,
44.439	working in 12 different industries.
46.92	In total, we spent hundreds
46.92	of hours on the ground,
49.92	on-site, watching these leaders in action.
53.2	We ended up with pages and pages
53.2	and pages of field notes
56.559	that we analyzed and looked
56.559	for patterns in what our leaders did.
59.92	The bottom line?
61.979	If we want to build organizations
61.979	that can innovate time and again,
65.14	we must unlearn our conventional
65.14	notions of leadership.
68.959	Leading innovation is not
68.959	about creating a vision,
71.56	and inspiring others to execute it.
74.76	But what do we mean by innovation?
76.718	An innovation is anything
76.718	that is both new and useful.
80.079	It can be a product or service.
81.84	It can be a process
81.84	or a way of organizing.
84.519	It can be incremental,
84.519	or it can be breakthrough.
87.359	We have a pretty inclusive definition.
89.28	How many of you recognize this man?
91.879	Put your hands up.
94.56	Keep your hands up,
94.56	if you know who this is.
102.319	How about these familiar faces?
104.599	(Laughter)
106.68	From your show of hands,
107.84	it looks like many of you
107.84	have seen a Pixar movie,
110.28	but very few of you recognized Ed Catmull,
113.239	the founder and CEO of Pixar --
115.879	one of the companies
115.879	I had the privilege of studying.
118.799	My first visit to Pixar was in 2005,
121.479	"when they were working on ""Ratatouille,"""
123.4	that provocative movie about
123.4	a rat becoming a master chef.
126.52	Computer-generated movies
126.52	are really mainstream today,
130.439	but it took Ed and his
130.439	colleagues nearly 20 years
133.12	to create the first
133.12	full-length C.G. movie.
136.96	In the 20 years hence,
136.96	they've produced 14 movies.
140.24	I was recently at Pixar,
140.24	and I'm here to tell you
143	that number 15 is sure to be a winner.
146.069	When many of us think
146.069	about innovation, though,
148.28	we think about an Einstein
148.28	having an 'Aha!' moment.
151.919	But we all know that's a myth.
154.28	Innovation is not about solo genius,
157.24	it's about collective genius.
160.479	Let's think for a minute about
160.479	what it takes to make a Pixar movie:
164.159	No solo genius, no flash of inspiration
164.159	produces one of those movies.
169.68	On the contrary, it takes about
174.08	to make one of those movies.
175.639	To help us understand the process,
178.319	an individual in the studio
178.319	drew a version of this picture.
181.96	He did so reluctantly,
183.469	because it suggested that the process 
183.469	was a neat series of steps
187.84	done by discrete groups.
190.13	Even with all those arrows,
190.13	he thought it failed to really tell you
193.99	just how iterative, interrelated
193.99	and, frankly, messy their process was.
198.84	Throughout the making of a movie
198.84	at Pixar, the story evolves.
204.94	So think about it.
206.52	Some shots go through quickly.
209.28	They don't all go through in order.
211.56	It depends on how vexing
211.56	the challenges are
214.199	that they come up with when they
214.199	are working on a particular scene.
218.52	"So if you think about that scene in ""Up"""
220.919	where the boy hands the piece
220.919	of chocolate to the bird,
224.12	that 10 seconds took one animator
224.12	almost six months to perfect.
230.259	The other thing about a Pixar movie
232	is that no part of the movie
232	is considered finished
234.4	until the entire movie wraps.
236.319	Partway through one production,
236.319	an animator drew a character
240.759	with an arched eyebrow that
240.759	suggested a mischievous side.
244.76	When the director saw that
244.76	drawing, he thought it was great.
247.77	It was beautiful, but he said,
249.199	"""You've got to lose it;"
249.199	"it doesn't fit the character."""
252.02	Two weeks later, the director
252.02	came back and said,
254.48	"""Let's put in those few seconds of film."""
256.56	Because that animator
256.56	was allowed to share
259.6	what we referred to
259.6	as his slice of genius,
262.8	he was able to help that director
262.8	reconceive the character
266.12	in a subtle but important way
266.12	that really improved the story.
270.759	What we know is, at the heart
270.759	of innovation is a paradox.
275.399	You have to unleash the talents
275.399	and passions of many people
279.079	and you have to harness them
279.079	into a work that is actually useful.
283.809	Innovation is a journey.
286.049	It's a type of collaborative
286.049	problem solving,
288.879	usually among people
288.879	who have different expertise
291.639	and different points of view.
293.759	Innovations rarely get created full-blown.
296.319	As many of you know,
298.449	they're the result,
298.449	usually, of trial and error.
301.199	Lots of false starts,
301.199	missteps and mistakes.
305.399	Innovative work can be
305.399	very exhilarating,
308.199	but it also can be
308.199	really downright scary.
313.73	So when we look at why it is
313.73	that Pixar is able to do what it does,
319.079	we have to ask ourselves,
319.079	what's going on here?
323.839	For sure, history
323.839	and certainly Hollywood,
326.8	is full of star-studded teams
326.8	that have failed.
329.93	Most of those failures are attributed
331.79	to too many stars or too many
331.79	cooks, if you will, in the kitchen.
336.879	So why is it that Pixar,
336.879	with all of its cooks,
340.519	is able to be so successful
340.519	time and time again?
345.36	When we studied
345.36	an Islamic Bank in Dubai,
348.439	or a luxury brand in Korea,
348.439	or a social enterprise in Africa,
353	we found that innovative organizations
355.079	are communities that
355.079	have three capabilities:
357.879	creative abrasion, creative
357.879	agility and creative resolution.
362.959	Creative abrasion is about being able
362.959	to create a marketplace of ideas
367.96	through debate and discourse.
370.16	In innovative organizations,
370.16	they amplify differences,
373.079	they don't minimize them.
374.319	Creative abrasion is not
374.319	about brainstorming,
377.36	where people suspend their judgment.
379.48	No, they know how to have very
379.48	heated but constructive arguments
383.439	to create a portfolio of alternatives.
386.6	Individuals in innovative organizations
388.879	learn how to inquire, they learn how
388.879	to actively listen, but guess what?
393.169	They also learn how to
393.169	advocate for their point of view.
395.959	They understand that
395.959	innovation rarely happens
399.879	unless you have both
399.879	diversity and conflict.
403.96	Creative agility is about being able
403.96	to test and refine that portfolio of ideas
408.76	through quick pursuit,
408.76	reflection and adjustment.
412.12	It's about discovery-driven learning
413.959	where you act, as opposed to plan,
413.959	your way to the future.
417.199	It's about design thinking where
417.199	you have that interesting combination
420.68	of the scientific method
420.68	and the artistic process.
424.399	It's about running a series of
424.399	experiments, and not a series of pilots.
428.879	Experiments are usually about learning.
430.76	When you get a negative outcome,
432.31	you're still really learning something
432.31	that you need to know.
435.472	Pilots are often about being right.
437.959	When they don't work,
437.959	someone or something is to blame.
442.319	The final capability
442.319	is creative resolution.
445.279	This is about doing decision making
446.99	in a way that you can actually combine
446.99	even opposing ideas
450.519	to reconfigure them in new combinations
453.04	to produce a solution
453.04	that is new and useful.
456.319	When you look at innovative organizations,
456.319	they never go along to get along.
460.12	They don't compromise.
462.199	They don't let one group
462.199	or one individual dominate,
465.639	even if it's the boss,
465.639	even if it's the expert.
470	Instead, they have developed
471.839	a rather patient and more inclusive
471.839	decision making process
475.399	that allows for both/and
475.399	solutions to arise
479.079	and not simply either/or solutions.
481.879	These three capabilities are why we see
485.879	that Pixar is able to do what it does.
490.24	Let me give you another example,
492.209	and that example is the
492.209	infrastructure group of Google.
494.839	The infrastructure group
494.839	of Google is the group
497.519	that has to keep the website
497.519	up and running 24/7.
501.569	So when Google was about
501.569	to introduce Gmail and YouTube,
505.439	they knew that their data storage
505.439	system wasn't adequate.
508.759	The head of the engineering group
508.759	and the infrastructure group at that time
512.919	was a man named Bill Coughran.
515.48	Bill and his leadership team,
515.48	who he referred to as his brain trust,
519.24	had to figure out what to do
519.24	about this situation.
523.12	They thought about it for a while.
524.96	Instead of creating a group
524.96	to tackle this task,
528.44	they decided to allow groups
528.44	to emerge spontaneously
532.72	around different alternatives.
534.159	Two groups coalesced.
537	One became known as Big Table,
540.159	the other became known
540.159	as Build It From Scratch.
543.679	Big Table proposed that they
543.679	build on the current system.
546.6	Build It From Scratch proposed
546.6	that it was time for a whole new system.
550.96	Separately, these two teams
550.96	were allowed to work full-time
554.759	on their particular approach.
556.799	In engineering reviews,
556.799	Bill described his role as,
559.919	"""Injecting honesty into"
559.919	"the process by driving debate."""
564.879	Early on, the teams were encouraged
564.879	to build prototypes so that they could
568.879	"""bump them up against reality"
568.879	and discover for themselves
572.32	the strengths and weaknesses
572.32	"of their particular approach."""
575.12	When Build It From Scratch shared
575.12	their prototype with the group
578.14	whose beepers would have
578.14	to go off in the middle of the night
581.06	if something went wrong
581.06	with the website,
583.27	they heard loud and clear about the
583.27	limitations of their particular design.
588.12	As the need for a solution
588.12	became more urgent
591.039	and as the data, or the
591.039	evidence, began to come in,
594.32	it became pretty clear
594.32	that the Big Table solution
597.6	was the right one for the moment.
600.11	So they selected that one.
602.2	But to make sure that
602.2	they did not lose the learning
604.96	of the Build it From Scratch team,
606.84	Bill asked two members of that team
606.84	to join a new team that was emerging
610.25	to work on the next-generation system.
613.24	This whole process took nearly two years,
617	but I was told that they were
617	all working at breakneck speed.
621.399	Early in that process, one of the
621.399	engineers had gone to Bill and said,
624.72	"""We're all too busy"
624.72	for this inefficient system
627.759	"of running parallel experiments."""
630.24	But as the process unfolded,
630.24	he began to understand
633.32	the wisdom of allowing talented
633.32	people to play out their passions.
637.24	"He admitted, ""If you had forced us"
637.24	to all be on one team,
641.039	we might have focused on proving
641.039	who was right, and winning,
644.48	and not on learning and discovering
644.48	"what was the best answer for Google."""
650	Why is it that Pixar and Google
650	are able to innovate time and again?
653.559	It's because they've mastered
653.559	the capabilities required for that.
657.229	They know how to do
657.229	collaborative problem solving,
659.619	they know how to do
659.619	discovery-driven learning
661.759	and they know how to do
661.759	integrated decision making.
664.46	Some of you may be sitting there
664.46	and saying to yourselves right now,
667.679	"""We don't know how to do"
667.679	those things in my organization.
670.519	So why do they know how to
670.519	do those things at Pixar,
673.12	and why do they know how to
673.12	"do those things at Google?"""
676.559	When many of the people
676.559	that worked for Bill told us,
679.08	in their opinion, that Bill was one
679.08	of the finest leaders in Silicon Valley,
685.48	we completely agreed;
685.48	the man is a genius.
689.649	Leadership is the secret sauce.
692.559	But it's a different kind of leadership,
694.96	not the kind many of us think about
694.96	when we think about great leadership.
700.29	One of the leaders I met with
700.29	early on said to me,
702.96	"""Linda, I don't read books on leadership."
706.12	"All they do is make me feel bad."""
706.12	(Laughter)
709.039	"""In the first chapter they say"
709.039	I'm supposed to create a vision.
712	But if I'm trying to do something
712	that's truly new, I have no answers.
716.24	I don't know what
716.24	direction we're going in
718.24	and I'm not even sure I know
718.24	"how to figure out how to get there."""
721.899	For sure, there are times
721.899	when visionary leadership
724.44	is exactly what is needed.
726.48	But if we want to build organizations
726.48	that can innovate time and again,
729.879	we must recast our understanding
729.879	of what leadership is about.
734	Leading innovation is about
734	creating the space
737.72	where people are willing
737.72	and able to do the hard work
740.919	of innovative problem solving.
743.399	At this point, some of you
743.399	may be wondering,
747.24	"""What does that leadership"
747.24	"really look like?"""
749.559	At Pixar, they understand
749.559	that innovation takes a village.
754.48	The leaders focus on building
754.48	a sense of community
757.919	and building those three capabilities.
760.2	How do they define leadership?
762.48	They say leadership
762.48	is about creating a world
764.759	to which people want to belong.
766.72	What kind of world do people
766.72	want to belong in at Pixar?
769.36	A world where you're
769.36	living at the frontier.
771.44	What do they focus their time on?
773.759	Not on creating a vision.
775.23	Instead they spend
775.23	their time thinking about,
777.36	"""How do we design a studio that has"
777.36	the sensibility of a public square
782.2	so that people will interact?
784.36	Let's put in a policy that anyone,
784.36	no matter what their level or role,
788.03	is allowed to give notes to the director
789.96	about how they feel
789.96	about a particular film.
792.519	What can we do to make sure
794.519	that all the disruptors, all the
794.519	minority voices in this organization,
798.399	speak up and are heard?
800.399	And, finally, let's bestow credit
800.399	"in a very generous way."""
804.02	I don't know if you've ever looked
804.02	at the credits of a Pixar movie,
807.32	but the babies born during
807.32	a production are listed there.
810.48	(Laughter)
811.879	How did Bill think about
811.879	what his role was?
814.879	"Bill said, ""I lead"
814.879	a volunteer organization.
818.36	Talented people don't want
818.36	to follow me anywhere.
822.12	They want to cocreate
822.12	with me the future.
825.679	My job is to nurture the bottom-up
828.159	"and not let it degenerate into chaos."""
831.519	How did he see his role?
832.84	"""I'm a role model,"
832.84	I'm a human glue,
835.639	I'm a connector,
835.639	I'm an aggregator of viewpoints.
838.279	"I'm never a dictator of viewpoints."""
840.519	Advice about how you exercise the role?
842.639	Hire people who argue with you.
845.139	And, guess what?
846.509	Sometimes it's best to be
846.509	deliberately fuzzy and vague.
851.22	Some of you may
851.22	be wondering now,
852.969	what are these people thinking?
854.84	They're thinking,
855.85	"""I'm not the visionary,"
855.85	I'm the social architect.
858.84	I'm creating the space where
858.84	people are willing and able
862.44	to share and combine
862.44	"their talents and passions."""
865.789	If some of you are worrying now
865.789	that you don't work at a Pixar,
868.919	or you don't work at a Google,
870.559	I want to tell you there's still hope.
873	We've studied many organizations
875	that were really not
875	organizations you'd think of
877.29	as ones where a lot of innovation happens.
880.22	We studied a general counsel
880.22	in a pharmaceutical company
883.279	who had to figure out how
883.279	to get the outside lawyers,
	to collaborate and innovate.
888.759	We studied the head of marketing
888.759	at a German automaker
892.609	where, fundamentally, they believed
892.609	that it was the design engineers,
895.89	not the marketeers,
895.89	who were allowed to be innovative.
899.009	We also studied Vineet Nayar
899.009	at HCL Technologies,
903.12	an Indian outsourcing company.
905.18	When we met Vineet,
906.729	his company was about, in his
906.729	words, to become irrelevant.
910.08	We watched as he turned that company
910.08	into a global dynamo of I.T. innovation.
916.6	At HCL technologies,
916.6	like at many companies,
919.56	the leaders had learned to see
919.56	their role as setting direction
923.72	and making sure that
923.72	no one deviated from it.
927.139	What he did is tell them
927.139	it was time for them
931.32	to think about rethinking
931.32	what they were supposed to do.
934.74	Because what was happening
934.74	is that everybody was looking up
937.6	and you weren't seeing
937.6	the kind of bottom-up innovation
940.759	we saw at Pixar or Google.
943.119	So they began to work on that.
944.679	They stopped giving answers, they
944.679	stopped trying to provide solutions.
948.84	Instead, what they did
948.84	is they began to see
951.679	the people at the bottom of the
951.679	pyramid, the young sparks,
955.556	the people who were
955.556	closest to the customers,
958.03	as the source of innovation.
960.58	They began to transfer
960.58	the organization's growth
963.713	to that level.
967.126	In Vineet's language, this was
967.126	about inverting the pyramid
970.879	so that you could unleash
970.879	the power of the many
973.919	by loosening the stranglehold of the few,
976.84	and increase the quality
976.84	and the speed of innovation
979.96	that was happening every day.
983.6	For sure, Vineet and all the
983.6	other leaders that we studied
987.389	were in fact visionaries.
990.52	For sure, they understood
990.52	that that was not their role.
995.06	So I don't think it is accidental
995.06	that many of you did not recognize Ed.
1000.24	Because Ed, like Vineet, understands
1000.24	that our role as leaders
1004.919	is to set the stage, not perform on it.
1009.08	If we want to invent a better future,
1011.96	and I suspect that's why
1011.96	many of us are here,
1015.24	then we need to reimagine our task.
1019.12	Our task is to create the space
1021.799	where everybody's slices of genius
1024.44	can be unleashed and harnessed,
1028.96	and turned into works
1028.96	of collective genius.
1031.72	Thank you.
