25	I want to start off by saying, Houston, we have a problem.
30	We're entering a second generation of no progress
34	in terms of human flight in space. In fact, we've regressed.
39	We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth
45	to go out and continue this very important thing
48	that we as a species have always done.
50	And that is, instinctively we've gone out
53	and climbed over difficult places, went to more hostile places,
59	and found out later, maybe to our surprise, that that's the reason we survived.
65	And I feel very strongly
67	that it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids
71	that think that it's OK to look forward to a better version
75	of a cell phone with a video in it.
78	They need to look forward to exploration; they need to look forward to colonization;
82	they need to look forward to breakthroughs.
86	We need to inspire them, because they need to lead us
90	and help us survive in the future.
93	I'm particularly troubled that what NASA's doing right now with this new Bush doctrine
99	to -- for this next decade and a half -- oh shoot, I screwed up.
105	We have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics.
110	(Laughter)
111	What we're looking forward to is --
114	(Applause)
115	what we're looking forward to
118	is not only the inspiration of our children,
121	but the current plan right now is not really even allowing
126	the most creative people in this country -- the Boeing's and Lockheed's
130	space engineers -- to go out and take risks and try new stuff.
136	We're going to go back to the moon ... 50 years later?
142	And we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new.
148	I'm really troubled by that. But anyway that's --
152	the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today, though,
156	is that right back to where we inspire people
160	who will be our great leaders later.
162	That's the theme of my next 15 minutes here.
166	And I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young:
170	three-year-olds, up to 12-, 14-year-olds.
174	What they look at is the most important thing.
178	Let's take a snapshot at aviation.
181	And there was a wonderful little short four-year time period
184	when marvelous things happened.
187	It started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said,
191	"""Ooh, hey, I can do that."" There's only a few people that have flown"
195	in early 1908. In four years, 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes,
200	thousand of pilots. Airplanes were invented by natural selection.
204	Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today,
208	but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes.
212	There were probably at least 30,000 different things tried,
217	and when they crash and kill the pilot, don't try that again.
221	The ones that flew and landed OK
224	because there were no trained pilots
225	who had good flying qualities by definition.
229	So we, by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attempts,
234	in that four-year time period, we invented the concepts
237	of the airplanes that we fly today. And that's why they're so safe,
240	as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good.
244	That has not happened at all in space flying.
246	There's only been two concepts tried -- two by the U.S. and one by the Russians.
250	Well, who was inspired during that time period?
252	Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought
255	were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation.
258	And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them
262	was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation.
269	Well, what happened when I was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too.
273	The jet age started: the missile age started. Von Braun was on there
278	showing how to go to Mars -- and this was before Sputnik.
280	And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting
284	than it is now. We thought there'd be animals there;
286	we knew there were plants there; the colors change, right?
290	But, you know, NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots
293	and they've landed it only in the deserts.
296	(Laughter)
300	If you look at what happened -- this little black line is as fast as man ever flew,
307	and the red line is top-of-the-line military fighters
310	and the blue line is commercial air transport.
313	You notice here's a big jump when I was a little kid --
315	and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage
319	to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try.
324	Well, what did I do when I was a kid?
326	I didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing
329	and, well, we didn't have drugs in those days. But I did competition model airplanes.
334	I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War
336	flight-testing airplanes for the Air Force.
339	And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes
341	that people could build in their garages.
344	And some 3,000 of those are flying. Of course, one of them
347	is around the world Voyager. I founded another company in '82,
351	which is my company now.
353	And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982.
360	And there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart.
364	The most impressive airplane ever, I believe, was designed
368	only a dozen years after the first operational jet.
372	Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service.
376	We retreated in '98 back to something that was developed in '56. What?
383	The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe,
386	was a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a -- you know, it landed on the moon,
391	take off of the moon, didn't need any maintenance guys --
393	that's kind of cool.
395	We've lost that capability. We abandoned it in '72.
398	This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961.
403	Three years, and we can't do that now. Crazy.
408	Talk very briefly about innovation cycles, things that grow,
413	have a lot of activity; they die out when they're replaced by something else.
417	These things tend to happen every 25 years.
424	on all kinds of different technologies. The interesting thing --
427	by the way, the speed here, excuse me, higher-speed travel
430	is the title of these innovation cycles. There is none here.
436	These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958.
444	Here's the biggie, and that is, you don't have innovation cycles
447	if the government develops and the government uses it.
450	You know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net.
454	Computers were used for artillery first, then IRS.
457	But when we got it, now you have all the level of activity,
460	all the benefit from it. Private sector has to do it.
464	Keep that in mind. I put down innovation --
467	I've looked for innovation cycles in space; I found none.
470	The very first year, starting when Gagarin went in space,
474	and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd, there were five manned
477	space flights in the world -- the very first year.
480	In 2003, everyone that the United States sent to space was killed.
489	There were only three or four flights in 2003.
491	In 2004, there were only two flights: two Russian Soyuz flights
498	to the international manned station. And I had to fly three in Mojave
502	with my little group of a couple dozen people
504	in order to get to a total of five,
506	which was the number the same year back in 1961.
511	There is no growth. There's no activity. There's no nothing.
516	This is a picture here taken from SpaceShipOne.
519	This is a picture here taken from orbit.
521	Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that.
527	We know how to do it for sub-orbital flying now, do it safe enough --
531	at least as safe as the early airlines -- so that can be done.
535	And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage
540	to go out and try that as a small company.
547	Well, first of all, what's going to happen next?
550	The first industry will be a high volume, a lot of players.
554	There's another one announced just last week.
557	And it will be sub-orbital. And the reason it has to be sub-orbital
563	is, there is not solutions for adequate safety
566	to fly the public to orbit. The governments have been doing this --
571	three governments have been doing this for 45 years,
573	and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died.
577	That's -- You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record.
582	It'll be very high volume; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020.
588	I can't tell you when this will start,
590	because I don't want my competition to know my schedule.
593	But I think once it does, we will find solutions,
598	and very quickly, you'll see those resort hotels in orbit.
601	And that real easy thing to do, which is a swing around the moon
604	so you have this cool view. And that will be really cool.
608	Because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere --
610	you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want.
613	Oh, it's going to be so much fun.
615	(Laughter)
617	"OK. My critics say, ""Hey, Rutan's just spending"
621	a lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires.
626	"What's this? This is not a transportation system; it's just for fun."""
631	And I used to be bothered by that, and then I got to thinking,
634	well, wait a minute. I bought my first Apple computer in 1978
639	"and I bought it because I could say, ""I got a computer at my house and you don't."
645	"'What do you use it for?' Come over. It does Frogger."" OK."
650	(Laughter)
651	Not the bank's computer or Lockheed's computer,
654	but the home computer was for games.
657	For a whole decade it was for fun -- we didn't even know what it was for.
661	But what happened, the fact that we had this big industry,
665	big development, big improvement and capability and so on,
669	and they get out there in enough homes -- we were ripe for a new invention.
674	And the inventor is in this audience.
676	Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that,
680	something that we used for a whole year -- excuse me --
683	a whole decade for fun, became everything -- our commerce, our research,
689	our communication and, if we let the Google guys
693	think for another couple weekends, we can add a dozen more things to the list. (Laughter)
697	And it won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kids
700	that we didn't always have computers in our homes.
705	So fun is defendable.
708	OK, I want to show you kind of a busy chart,
713	but in it is my prediction with what's going to happen.
716	And in it also brings up another point, right here.
720	There's a group of people that have come forward --
724	and you don't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward
727	were inspired as young children, this little three- to 15-year-old age,
734	by us going to orbit and going to the moon here,
737	right in this time period.
739	Paul Allen, Elan Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, the Ansari family,
749	which is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing,
754	Bob Bigelow, a private space station, and Carmack.
758	These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area,
764	and I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area
767	of a better cell phone or something -- but they're putting it in very --
771	areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability,
775	and it will lead us into the next really big thing
777	and it will allow us to explore. And I think eventually
781	it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct.
785	They were inspired by big progress. But look at the progress that's going on after that.
791	There were a couple of examples here.
793	The military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane
797	was the SR71. It went a whole life cycle, got too rusty to fly,
802	and was taken out of service. The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel.
807	It went a whole life cycle without competition,
810	took out of service. And we're stuck back here
813	with the same kind of capability for military fighters
816	and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late '50s.
820	But something is out there to inspire our kids now.
824	And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now,
826	or if you've got a 10-year-old now.
827	What's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here.
833	Relatively soon, you'll be able to buy a ticket
835	and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance
840	military operational airplane. It's never happened before.
844	The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance
849	has been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes;
852	why do you need something better?
853	But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying
856	sub-orbital flights to space, very soon -- wait a minute,
861	what's happening here, we'll have military fighters
864	with sub-orbital capability, and I think very soon this.
867	But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first.
871	"OK, I look forward to a new ""capitalist's space race,"" let's call it."
877	You remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige,
881	because we lost the first two milestones.
884	We didn't lose them technically. The fact that we had the hardware
888	to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it --
893	you can argue that's not a technical loss.
895	Sputnik wasn't a technical loss, but it was a prestige loss.
899	America -- the world saw America as not being the leader in technology,
906	and that was a very strong thing.
908	And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin,
913	not months or decades, or whatever. So we had the capability.
918	But America lost. We lost. And because of that, we made a big jump to recover it.
927	Well, again, what's interesting here is we've lost
930	to the Russians on the first couple of milestones already.
933	You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America --
938	can't do it. You can buy it in Russia.
943	You can fly with Russian hardware. This is available
946	because a Russian space program is starving,
949	and it's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats.
954	It's commercial. It can be defined as space tourism. They are also offering a trip
961	to go on this whip around the moon, like Apollo 8 was done.
968	But, you know, would you have thought back in the '60s,
971	when the space race was going on,
973	that the first commercial capitalist-like thing to do
979	to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware?
983	And would you have thought, would the Russians have thought,
986	that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware,
990	the guys inside won't be Russians? Maybe it'll probably be a Japanese
994	or an American billionaire? Well, that's weird: you know, it really is.
998	But anyway, I think we need to beat them again.
1002	I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful,
1009	private space flight industry. Whether we're first or not really doesn't matter.
1014	The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde.
1020	And then they flew a few cargo flights, and took it out of service.
1024	I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel
1027	when the commercial stuff is offered.
1031	OK, we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight.
1035	This little thing says here: five times
1037	what NASA's doing by 2020. I want to tell you, already
1045	there's about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion
1049	investment in private space flight that is not government at all --
1055	already, worldwide. If you read -- if you Google it,
1060	you'll find about half of that money, but there's twice of that
1063	being committed out there -- not spent yet, but being committed
1067	and planned for the next few years. Hey, that's pretty big.
1070	I'm predicting, though, as profitable as this industry is going to be --
1075	and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars
1079	on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost,
1083	or less -- this is going to be very profitable.
1087	I predict, also, that the investment that will flow into this
1090	will be somewhere around half of what the U.S. taxpayer
1094	spends for NASA's manned spacecraft work.
1098	And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently
1103	by a factor of 10 to 15. And what that means is before we know it,
1111	the progress in human space flight, with no taxpayer dollars,
1118	will be at a level of about five times as much
1124	as the current NASA budgets for human space flight.
1129	And that is because it's us. It's private industry.
1137	You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff --
1143	and we've done it for a long time. The NACA, before NASA,
1146	never developed an airliner and never ran an airline.
1150	But NASA is developing the space liner, always has,
1154	and runs the only space line, OK. And we've shied away from it
1161	because we're afraid of it. But starting back in June of 2004,
1167	when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it,
1172	can get a start with it, everything changed after that time.
1175	OK, thank you very much.
1177	(Applause)
