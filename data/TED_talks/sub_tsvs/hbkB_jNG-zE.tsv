13.066	Twenty-five years ago, scientists at CERN
13.066	created the World Wide Web.
18.174	Since then, the Internet has transformed 
18.174	the way we communicate,
22.083	the way we do business,
22.083	and even the way we live.
25.545	In many ways,
27.717	the ideas that gave birth to Google,
27.717	Facebook, Twitter, and so many others,
32.542	have now really transformed our lives,
35.146	and this has brought us many real benefits
35.146	such as a more connected society.
39.433	However, there are also
39.433	some downsides to this.
43.134	Today, the average person
43.134	has an astounding amount
45.967	of personal information online,
48.08	and we add to this online information
48.08	every single time we post on Facebook,
51.737	each time we search on Google,
53.939	and each time we send an email.
56.341	Now, many of us probably think,
58.343	well, one email,
58.343	there's nothing in there, right?
61.453	But if you consider
61.453	a year's worth of emails,
64.659	or maybe even a lifetime of email,
67.561	collectively, this tells a lot.
69.907	It tells where we have been,
69.907	who we have met,
73.47	and in many ways,
73.47	even what we're thinking about.
76.709	And the more scary part about this is
76.709	our data now lasts forever,
81.086	so your data can and will outlive you.
84.093	What has happened is that we've largely
84.093	lost control over our data
87.622	and also our privacy.
89.944	So this year, as the web turns 25,
93.474	it's very important for us
93.474	to take a moment
95.772	and think about the implications of this.
98.304	We have to really think.
100.006	We've lost privacy, yes,
101.796	but actually what we've also lost
101.796	is the idea of privacy itself.
105.995	If you think about it,
107.749	most of us here today probably remember 
107.749	what life was like before the Internet,
111.763	but today, there's a new generation
114.305	that is being taught from a very young age
114.305	to share everything online,
117.725	and this is a generation that is not 
117.725	going to remember when data was private.
122.204	So we keep going down this road,
125.592	the word 'privacy' is going to have
125.592	a completely different meaning
128.688	from what it means to you and I.
130.973	So, it's time for us 
130.973	to take a moment and think,
133.413	is there anything we can do about this?
136.22	And I believe there is.
138.705	Let's take a look at one of the most
138.705	widely used forms of communication
142.266	in the world today: email.
144.533	Before the invention of email,
144.533	we largely communicated using letters,
148.294	and the process was quite simple.
150.616	You would first start by writing
150.616	your message on a piece of paper,
153.728	then you would place it
153.728	into a sealed envelope,
156.132	and from there,
156.132	you would go ahead and send it
158.387	after you put a stamp and address on it.
160.345	Unfortunately, today,
161.825	when we actually send an email,
161.825	we're not sending a letter.
164.642	What you are sending, in many ways,
164.642	is actually a postcard,
167.417	and it's a postcard in the sense
167.417	that everybody that sees it
171.064	from the time it leaves your computer
171.064	to when it gets to the recipient
174.699	can actually read the entire contents.
177.319	So, the solution to this
177.319	has been known for some time,
180.778	and there's many attempts to do it.
182.621	The most basic solution
182.621	is to use encryption,
185.77	and the idea is quite simple.
187.697	First, you encrypt the connection
189.466	between your computer
189.466	and the email server.
192.074	Then, you also encrypt the data
192.074	as it sits on the server itself.
195.7	But there's a problem with this,
197.646	and that is, the email servers
197.646	also hold the encryption keys,
200.595	so now you have a really big lock
200.595	with a key placed right next to it.
204.98	But not only that, any government
204.98	could lawfully ask for
208.211	and get the key to your data,
210.441	and this is all without you
210.441	being aware of it.
213.064	So the way we fix this problem
213.064	is actually relatively easy, in principle:
218.337	You give everybody their own keys,
220.739	and then you make sure the server
220.739	doesn't actually have the keys.
224.012	This seems like common sense, right?
226.148	So the question that comes up is,
226.148	why hasn't this been done yet?
230.261	Well, if we really think about it,
232.796	we see that the business model
232.796	of the Internet today
235.721	really isn't compatible with privacy.
237.788	Just take a look at some
237.788	of the biggest names on the web,
240.574	and you see that advertising
240.574	plays a huge role.
243.501	In fact, this year alone,
243.501	advertising is 137 billion dollars,
248.329	and to optimize the ads
248.329	that are shown to us,
250.5	companies have to know
250.5	everything about us.
252.633	They need to know where we live,
254.552	how old we are, what we like,
254.552	what we don't like,
258.207	and anything else
258.207	they can get their hands on.
260.369	And if you think about it,
262.098	the best way to get this information
262.098	is really just to invade our privacy.
266.246	So these companies
266.246	aren't going to give us our privacy.
269.437	If we want to have privacy online,
271.252	what we have to do is
271.252	we've got to go out and get it ourselves.
274.795	For many years, when it came to email,
277.063	the only solution
277.063	was something known as PGP,
279.978	which was quite complicated
279.978	and only accessible to the tech-savvy.
283.192	Here's a diagram that basically shows
285.61	the process for encrypting
285.61	and decrypting messages.
288.345	So needless to say,
288.345	this is not a solution for everybody,
291.231	and this actually is part of the problem,
294.363	because if you think about communication,
296.825	by definition, it involves
296.825	having someone to communicate with.
301.18	So while PGP does a great job
301.18	of what it's designed to do,
304.394	for the people out there
304.394	who can't understand how to use it,
307.215	the option to communicate privately
307.215	simply does not exist.
310.117	And this is a problem
310.117	that we need to solve.
313.125	So if we want to have privacy online,
315.123	the only way we can succeed
315.123	is if we get the whole world on board,
318.442	and this is only possible
318.442	if we bring down the barrier to entry.
321.693	I think this is actually the key challenge
321.693	that lies in the tech community.
325.222	What we really have to do
325.222	is work and make privacy more accessible.
329.285	So last summer, when
329.285	the Edward Snowden story came out,
332.281	several colleagues and I decided to see
332.281	if we could make this happen.
335.896	At that time, we were working at the
335.896	European Organization for Nuclear Research
340.883	at the world's largest particle collider,
340.883	which collides protons, by the way.
344.614	We were all scientists,
344.614	so we used our scientific creativity
348.059	and came up with a very
348.059	creative name for our project:
351.293	ProtonMail.
351.293	(Laughter)
353.389	Many startups these days
353.389	actually begin in people's garages
356.257	or people's basements.
357.941	We were a bit different.
359.438	We started out at the CERN cafeteria,
362.081	which actually is great, because look,
364.537	you have all the food
364.537	and water you could ever want.
367.01	But even better than this
367.01	is that every day
369.49	between 12 p.m. and 2 p.m.,
369.49	free of charge,
373.461	the CERN cafeteria comes with
373.461	several thousand scientists and engineers,
377.71	and these guys basically know
377.71	the answers to everything.
380.496	So it was in this environment
380.496	that we began working.
383.283	What we actually want to do
383.283	is we want to take your email
386.394	and turn it into something
386.394	that looks more like this,
389.854	but more importantly,
389.854	we want to do it in a way
392.129	that you can't even tell
392.129	that it's happened.
394.274	So to do this, we actually need
394.274	a combination of technology
397.261	and also design.
398.848	So how do we go about
398.848	doing something like this?
402.018	Well, it's probably a good idea
402.018	not to put the keys on the server.
406.172	So what we do is we generate
406.172	encryption keys on your computer,
410.07	and we don't generate a single key,
410.07	but actually a pair of keys,
413.858	so there's an RSA private key
413.858	and an RSA public key,
417.563	and these keys
417.563	are mathematically connected.
420.191	So let's have a look
420.191	and see how this works
422.396	when multiple people communicate.
424.787	So here we have Bob and Alice,
424.787	who want to communicate privately.
429.232	So the key challenge
429.232	is to take Bob's message
432.794	and to get it to Alice in such a way
432.794	that the server cannot read that message.
437.103	So what we have to do
437.103	is we have to encrypt it
439.516	before it even leaves Bob's computer,
441.64	and one of the tricks is, we encrypt it
441.64	using the public key from Alice.
446.141	Now this encrypted data is sent
446.141	through the server to Alice,
451.333	and because the message was encrypted
451.333	using Alice's public key,
455.613	the only key that can now decrypt it
455.613	is a private key that belongs to Alice,
459.901	and it turns out Alice is the only person
459.901	that actually has this key.
464.616	So we've now accomplished the objective,
467.284	which is to get the message
467.284	from Bob to Alice
469.451	without the server being able
469.451	to read what's going on.
472.143	Actually, what I've shown here
472.143	is a highly simplified picture.
475.1	The reality is much more complex
477.105	and it requires a lot of software
477.105	that looks a bit like this.
480.819	And that's actually
480.819	the key design challenge:
483.259	How do we take all this complexity,
483.259	all this software,
486.78	and implement it in a way
486.78	that the user cannot see it.
490.898	I think with ProtonMail,
490.898	we have gotten pretty close to doing this.
494.496	So let's see how it works in practice.
496.958	Here, we've got Bob and Alice again,
499.975	who also want to communicate securely.
501.945	They simply create accounts on ProtonMail,
504.132	which is quite simple
504.132	and takes a few moments,
506.542	and all the key encryption and generation
508.964	is happening automatically
508.964	in the background
511.354	as Bob is creating his account.
513.06	Once his account is created,
513.06	"he just clicks ""compose,"""
515.602	and now he can write his email
515.602	like he does today.
518.589	So he fills in his information,
520.456	and then after that, 
520.456	"all he has to do is click ""send,"""
523.74	and just like that,
523.74	without understanding cryptography,
527.281	and without doing anything different
527.281	from how he writes email today,
530.834	Bob has just sent an encrypted message.
533.481	What we have here
533.481	is really just the first step,
537.593	but it shows that
537.593	with improving technology,
539.89	privacy doesn't have to be difficult,
539.89	it doesn't have to be disruptive.
544.065	If we change the goal from maximizing 
544.065	ad revenue to protecting data,
548.512	we can actually make it accessible.
551.008	Now, I know a question
551.008	on everybody's minds is,
553.468	okay, protecting privacy,
553.468	this is a great goal,
555.858	but can you actually do this
558.298	without the tons of money
558.298	that advertisements give you?
561.09	And I think the answer is actually yes,
563.476	because today, we've reached a point
565.706	where people around the world really
565.706	understand how important privacy is,
569.652	and when you have that,
569.652	anything is possible.
572.625	Earlier this year,
573.789	ProtonMail actually had so many users 
573.789	that we ran out of resources,
577.454	and when this happened,
577.454	our community of users got together
580.283	and donated half a million dollars.
582.399	So this is just an example
582.399	of what can happen
584.83	when you bring the community together
584.83	towards a common goal.
587.643	We can also leverage the world.
589.449	Right now,
590.597	we have a quarter of a million people
590.597	that have signed up for ProtonMail,
594.023	and these people come from everywhere,
595.832	and this really shows that privacy
597.464	is not just an American
597.464	or a European issue,
599.716	it's a global issue
599.716	that impacts all of us.
602.061	It's something that we really
602.061	have to pay attention to going forward.
605.521	So what do we have to do
605.521	to solve this problem?
608.517	Well, first of all,
610.514	we need to support a different
610.514	business model for the Internet,
613.508	one that does not rely
613.508	entirely on advertisements
615.841	for revenue and for growth.
618.175	We actually need to build a new Internet
620.684	where our privacy and our ability 
620.684	to control our data is first and foremost.
626.377	But even more importantly,
628.122	we have to build an Internet 
628.122	where privacy is no longer just an option
632.99	but is also the default.
635.923	We have done the first step
635.923	with ProtonMail,
638.493	but this is really just the first step
638.493	in a very, very long journey.
642.074	The good news I can share
642.074	with you guys today,
644.997	the exciting news,
644.997	is that we're not traveling alone.
647.525	The movement to protect people's privacy
647.525	and freedom online
650.375	is really gaining momentum,
651.861	and today, there are dozens of projects
651.861	from all around the world
655.455	who are working together
655.455	to improve our privacy.
658.966	These projects protect things
658.966	from our chat to voice communications,
662.612	also our file storage, our online search,
665.416	our online browsing,
665.416	and many other things.
668.457	And these projects are not backed
668.457	by billions of dollars in advertising,
671.986	but they've found support
671.986	really from the people,
674.309	from private individuals like you and I
674.309	from all over the world.
677.356	This really matters, because ultimately,
680.473	privacy depends on each
680.473	and every one of us,
683.944	and we have to protect it now
683.944	because our online data
686.777	is more than just a collection
686.777	of ones and zeros.
689.541	It's actually a lot more than that.
691.397	It's our lives, our personal stories,
693.743	our friends, our families,
696.041	and in many ways,
696.041	also our hopes and our aspirations.
699.547	We need to spend time now
699.547	to really protect our right
702.651	to share this only with people
702.651	that we want to share this with,
705.601	because without this,
705.601	we simply can't have a free society.
708.341	So now's the time for us
708.341	to collectively stand up and say,
711.194	yes, we do want to live
711.194	in a world with online privacy,
714.687	and yes, we can work together
714.687	to turn this vision into a reality.
719.215	Thank you.
721.35	(Applause)
