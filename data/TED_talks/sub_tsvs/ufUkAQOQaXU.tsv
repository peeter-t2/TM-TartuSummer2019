15.734	Other people. Everyone is interested in other people.
18.543	Everyone has relationships with other people,
20.666	and they're interested in these relationships
22.258	for a variety of reasons.
24.113	Good relationships, bad relationships,
26.125	annoying relationships, agnostic relationships,
29.271	and what I'm going to do is focus on the central piece
32.695	of an interaction that goes on in a relationship.
35.998	So I'm going to take as inspiration the fact that we're all
38.334	interested in interacting with other people,
40.759	I'm going to completely strip it of all its complicating features,
44.591	and I'm going to turn that object, that simplified object,
48.485	into a scientific probe, and provide the early stages,
52.635	embryonic stages of new insights into what happens
55.084	in two brains while they simultaneously interact.
58.734	But before I do that, let me tell you a couple of things
61.027	that made this possible.
62.726	The first is we can now eavesdrop safely
65.507	on healthy brain activity.
68.218	Without needles and radioactivity,
70.795	without any kind of clinical reason, we can go down the street
73.658	and record from your friends' and neighbors' brains
76.785	while they do a variety of cognitive tasks, and we use
79.323	a method called functional magnetic resonance imaging.
83.057	You've probably all read about it or heard about in some
85.382	incarnation. Let me give you a two-sentence version of it.
89.76	So we've all heard of MRIs. MRIs use magnetic fields
93.244	and radio waves and they take snapshots of your brain
95.273	or your knee or your stomach,
97.634	grayscale images that are frozen in time.
99.679	In the 1990s, it was discovered you could use
102	the same machines in a different mode,
104.659	and in that mode, you could make microscopic blood flow
107.005	movies from hundreds of thousands of sites independently in the brain.
110.305	Okay, so what? In fact, the so what is, in the brain,
113.505	changes in neural activity, the things that make your brain work,
117.337	the things that make your software work in your brain,
119.347	are tightly correlated with changes in blood flow.
121.836	You make a blood flow movie, you have an independent
123.809	proxy of brain activity.
126.148	This has literally revolutionized cognitive science.
129.182	Take any cognitive domain you want, memory,
131.173	motor planning, thinking about your mother-in-law,
133.314	getting angry at people, emotional response, it goes on and on,
137.029	put people into functional MRI devices, and
140.118	image how these kinds of variables map onto brain activity.
143.501	It's in its early stages, and it's crude by some measures,
146.35	but in fact, 20 years ago, we were at nothing.
148.918	You couldn't do people like this. You couldn't do healthy people.
151.277	That's caused a literal revolution, and it's opened us up
153.765	to a new experimental preparation. Neurobiologists,
156.583	as you well know, have lots of experimental preps,
160.343	worms and rodents and fruit flies and things like this.
163.484	And now, we have a new experimental prep: human beings.
166.881	We can now use human beings to study and model
170.642	the software in human beings, and we have a few
173.592	burgeoning biological measures.
176.427	Okay, let me give you one example of the kinds of experiments that people do,
180.314	and it's in the area of what you'd call valuation.
182.991	Valuation is just what you think it is, you know?
185.126	If you went and you were valuing two companies against
187.93	one another, you'd want to know which was more valuable.
190.666	Cultures discovered the key feature of valuation thousands of years ago.
194.545	If you want to compare oranges to windshields, what do you do?
197.235	Well, you can't compare oranges to windshields.
199.591	They're immiscible. They don't mix with one another.
201.846	So instead, you convert them to a common currency scale,
204.197	put them on that scale, and value them accordingly.
206.903	Well, your brain has to do something just like that as well,
210.339	and we're now beginning to understand and identify
212.827	brain systems involved in valuation,
214.964	and one of them includes a neurotransmitter system
217.596	whose cells are located in your brainstem
220.228	and deliver the chemical dopamine to the rest of your brain.
223.403	I won't go through the details of it, but that's an important
225.845	discovery, and we know a good bit about that now,
228.002	and it's just a small piece of it, but it's important because
230.232	those are the neurons that you would lose if you had Parkinson's disease,
233.507	and they're also the neurons that are hijacked by literally
235.523	every drug of abuse, and that makes sense.
237.755	Drugs of abuse would come in, and they would change
240.091	the way you value the world. They change the way
241.88	you value the symbols associated with your drug of choice,
245.079	and they make you value that over everything else.
247.593	Here's the key feature though. These neurons are also
250.614	involved in the way you can assign value to literally abstract ideas,
254.115	and I put some symbols up here that we assign value to
256.156	for various reasons.
258.876	We have a behavioral superpower in our brain,
261.565	and it at least in part involves dopamine.
263.318	We can deny every instinct we have for survival for an idea,
267.507	for a mere idea. No other species can do that.
271.512	In 1997, the cult Heaven's Gate committed mass suicide
275.118	predicated on the idea that there was a spaceship
277.333	hiding in the tail of the then-visible comet Hale-Bopp
281.118	waiting to take them to the next level. It was an incredibly tragic event.
285.39	More than two thirds of them had college degrees.
288.875	But the point here is they were able to deny their instincts for survival
292.598	using exactly the same systems that were put there
295.464	to make them survive. That's a lot of control, okay?
299.506	One thing that I've left out of this narrative
301.595	is the obvious thing, which is the focus of the rest of my
303.829	little talk, and that is other people.
305.988	These same valuation systems are redeployed
308.984	when we're valuing interactions with other people.
311.476	So this same dopamine system that gets addicted to drugs,
314.747	that makes you freeze when you get Parkinson's disease,
317.271	that contributes to various forms of psychosis,
320.348	is also redeployed to value interactions with other people
324.268	and to assign value to gestures that you do
327.164	when you're interacting with somebody else.
329.738	Let me give you an example of this.
332.315	You bring to the table such enormous processing power
335.282	in this domain that you hardly even notice it.
337.906	Let me just give you a few examples. So here's a baby.
339.373	She's three months old. She still poops in her diapers and she can't do calculus.
343.103	She's related to me. Somebody will be very glad that she's up here on the screen.
346.456	You can cover up one of her eyes, and you can still read
348.832	something in the other eye, and I see sort of curiosity
351.587	in one eye, I see maybe a little bit of surprise in the other.
355.184	Here's a couple. They're sharing a moment together,
358.363	and we've even done an experiment where you can cut out
359.681	different pieces of this frame and you can still see
362.688	that they're sharing it. They're sharing it sort of in parallel.
365.192	Now, the elements of the scene also communicate this
367.655	to us, but you can read it straight off their faces,
369.89	and if you compare their faces to normal faces, it would be a very subtle cue.
373.393	Here's another couple. He's projecting out at us,
376.74	and she's clearly projecting, you know,
379.628	love and admiration at him.
381.891	Here's another couple. (Laughter)
385.526	And I'm thinking I'm not seeing love and admiration on the left. (Laughter)
390.676	In fact, I know this is his sister, and you can just see
393.236	"him saying, ""Okay, we're doing this for the camera,"
395.749	"and then afterwards you steal my candy and you punch me in the face."" (Laughter)"
401.451	He'll kill me for showing that.
403.557	All right, so what does this mean?
406.354	It means we bring an enormous amount of processing power to the problem.
409.704	It engages deep systems in our brain, in dopaminergic
413.352	systems that are there to make you chase sex, food and salt.
416.17	They keep you alive. It gives them the pie, it gives
419.064	that kind of a behavioral punch which we've called a superpower.
421.968	So how can we take that and arrange a kind of staged
425.622	social interaction and turn that into a scientific probe?
428.32	And the short answer is games.
431.011	Economic games. So what we do is we go into two areas.
435.415	One area is called experimental economics. The other area is called behavioral economics.
438.751	And we steal their games. And we contrive them to our own purposes.
442.829	So this shows you one particular game called an ultimatum game.
445.796	Red person is given a hundred dollars and can offer
447.641	a split to blue. Let's say red wants to keep 70,
451.364	and offers blue 30. So he offers a 70-30 split with blue.
455.45	"Control passes to blue, and blue says, ""I accept it,"""
458.301	in which case he'd get the money, or blue says,
460.257	"""I reject it,"" in which case no one gets anything. Okay?"
464.564	So a rational choice economist would say, well,
467.956	you should take all non-zero offers.
470.012	What do people do? People are indifferent at an 80-20 split.
473.774	At 80-20, it's a coin flip whether you accept that or not.
477.298	Why is that? You know, because you're pissed off.
480.189	You're mad. That's an unfair offer, and you know what an unfair offer is.
483.798	This is the kind of game done by my lab and many around the world.
486.502	That just gives you an example of the kind of thing that
489.046	these games probe. The interesting thing is, these games
492.784	require that you have a lot of cognitive apparatus on line.
496.491	You have to be able to come to the table with a proper model of another person.
499.419	You have to be able to remember what you've done.
502.632	You have to stand up in the moment to do that.
504.052	Then you have to update your model based on the signals coming back,
507.402	and you have to do something that is interesting,
510.374	which is you have to do a kind of depth of thought assay.
512.971	That is, you have to decide what that other person expects of you.
516.304	You have to send signals to manage your image in their mind.
519.258	Like a job interview. You sit across the desk from somebody,
522.111	they have some prior image of you,
523.48	you send signals across the desk to move their image
526.231	of you from one place to a place where you want it to be.
530.151	We're so good at this we don't really even notice it.
533.536	These kinds of probes exploit it. Okay?
537.303	In doing this, what we've discovered is that humans
539.11	are literal canaries in social exchanges.
541.441	Canaries used to be used as kind of biosensors in mines.
544.838	When methane built up, or carbon dioxide built up,
548.398	or oxygen was diminished, the birds would swoon
552.584	before people would -- so it acted as an early warning system:
554.91	Hey, get out of the mine. Things aren't going so well.
557.89	People come to the table, and even these very blunt,
560.844	staged social interactions, and they, and there's just
563.834	numbers going back and forth between the people,
566.85	and they bring enormous sensitivities to it.
569.049	So we realized we could exploit this, and in fact,
571.738	as we've done that, and we've done this now in
574.294	many thousands of people, I think on the order of
576.988	five or six thousand. We actually, to make this
579.153	a biological probe, need bigger numbers than that,
581.377	remarkably so. But anyway,
585.051	patterns have emerged, and we've been able to take
587.055	those patterns, convert them into mathematical models,
590.891	and use those mathematical models to gain new insights
593.58	into these exchanges. Okay, so what?
595.711	Well, the so what is, that's a really nice behavioral measure,
599.024	the economic games bring to us notions of optimal play.
602.343	We can compute that during the game.
604.827	And we can use that to sort of carve up the behavior.
607.78	Here's the cool thing. Six or seven years ago,
612.11	we developed a team. It was at the time in Houston, Texas.
614.66	It's now in Virginia and London. And we built software
618.054	that'll link functional magnetic resonance imaging devices
621.261	up over the Internet. I guess we've done up to six machines
625.296	at a time, but let's just focus on two.
627.277	So it synchronizes machines anywhere in the world.
630.335	We synchronize the machines, set them into these
633.504	staged social interactions, and we eavesdrop on both
635.487	of the interacting brains. So for the first time,
637.153	we don't have to look at just averages over single individuals,
640.76	or have individuals playing computers, or try to make
643.657	inferences that way. We can study individual dyads.
646.42	We can study the way that one person interacts with another person,
649.205	turn the numbers up, and start to gain new insights
651.769	into the boundaries of normal cognition,
654.284	but more importantly, we can put people with
657.016	classically defined mental illnesses, or brain damage,
660.353	into these social interactions, and use these as probes of that.
663.904	So we've started this effort. We've made a few hits,
666.254	a few, I think, embryonic discoveries.
668.703	We think there's a future to this. But it's our way
671.515	of going in and redefining, with a new lexicon,
674.075	a mathematical one actually, as opposed to the standard
678.097	ways that we think about mental illness,
680.675	characterizing these diseases, by using the people
682.742	as birds in the exchanges. That is, we exploit the fact
685.749	that the healthy partner, playing somebody with major depression,
689.993	or playing somebody with autism spectrum disorder,
692.903	or playing somebody with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,
696.753	we use that as a kind of biosensor, and then we use
699.972	computer programs to model that person, and it gives us
702.616	a kind of assay of this.
705.086	Early days, and we're just beginning, we're setting up sites
707.217	around the world. Here are a few of our collaborating sites.
710.627	The hub, ironically enough,
712.936	is centered in little Roanoke, Virginia.
715.825	There's another hub in London, now, and the rest
718.094	are getting set up. We hope to give the data away
722.103	at some stage. That's a complicated issue
725.776	about making it available to the rest of the world.
728.77	But we're also studying just a small part
730.617	of what makes us interesting as human beings, and so
732.884	I would invite other people who are interested in this
734.925	to ask us for the software, or even for guidance
737.494	on how to move forward with that.
739.713	Let me leave you with one thought in closing.
742.054	The interesting thing about studying cognition
743.996	has been that we've been limited, in a way.
747.728	We just haven't had the tools to look at interacting brains
750.671	simultaneously.
751.871	The fact is, though, that even when we're alone,
754.341	we're a profoundly social creature. We're not a solitary mind
758.452	built out of properties that kept it alive in the world
762.825	independent of other people. In fact, our minds
766.773	depend on other people. They depend on other people,
769.643	and they're expressed in other people,
771.184	so the notion of who you are, you often don't know
774.836	who you are until you see yourself in interaction with people
777.524	that are close to you, people that are enemies of you,
779.93	people that are agnostic to you.
782.475	So this is the first sort of step into using that insight
786.251	into what makes us human beings, turning it into a tool,
789.546	and trying to gain new insights into mental illness.
791.524	Thanks for having me. (Applause)
794.645	(Applause)
