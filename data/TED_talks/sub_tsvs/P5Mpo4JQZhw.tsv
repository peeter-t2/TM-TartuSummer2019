12.598	It was the middle of summer
12.598	and well past closing time
15.211	in the downtown Berkeley bar
15.211	where my friend Polly and I
17.898	worked together as bartenders.
20.693	Usually at the end of our shift
20.693	we had a drink -- but not that night.
25.732	"""I'm pregnant."
27.224	Not sure what I'm going
27.224	"to do yet,"" I told Polly."
30.729	Without hesitation, she replied,
30.729	"""I've had an abortion."""
34.819	Before Polly, no one had ever told me
34.819	that she'd had an abortion.
40.631	I'd graduated from college
40.631	just a few months earlier
43.336	and I was in a new relationship
43.336	when I found out that I was pregnant.
47.797	When I thought about my choices,
47.797	I honestly did not know how to decide,
52.534	what criteria I should use.
55.459	How would I know what
55.459	the right decision was?
58.408	I worried that I would regret 
58.408	an abortion later.
63.044	Coming of age on the beaches
63.044	of Southern California,
65.785	I grew up in the middle of 
65.785	our nation's abortion wars.
69.646	I was born in a trailer on the third
69.646	anniversary of Roe vs. Wade.
75.578	Our community was surfing Christians.
78.265	We cared about God, the less fortunate,
78.265	and the ocean.
82.022	Everyone was pro-life.
84.413	As a kid, the idea of abortion made me so
84.413	sad that I knew if I ever got pregnant
90.125	I could never have one.
93.412	And then I did.
96.789	It was a step towards the unknown.
99.531	But Polly had given me
99.531	a very special gift:
102.305	the knowledge that I wasn't alone
104.687	and the realization that abortion
104.687	was something that we can talk about.
109.055	Abortion is common.
111.37	According to the Guttmacher Institute,
111.37	one in three women in America
114.714	will have an abortion in their lifetime.
120.147	But for the last few decades, the dialogue
120.147	around abortion in the United States
124.05	has left little room for anything beyond 
124.05	pro-life and pro-choice.
127.944	It's political and polarizing.
130.688	But as much as abortion is hotly debated,
130.688	it's still rare for us,
134.982	whether as fellow women
134.982	or even just as fellow people,
138.898	to talk with one another
138.898	about the abortions that we have.
144.028	There is a gap.
145.43	Between what happens in politics
145.43	and what happens in real life,
149.215	and in that gap, a battlefield mentality.
151.794	"An ""are you with us "
151.794	"or against us?"" stance takes root."
156.058	This isn't just about abortion.
158.655	There are so many important issues 
158.655	that we can't talk about.
164.278	And so finding ways to shift the conflict
164.278	to a place of conversation
169.524	is the work of my life.
173.41	There are two main ways to get started.
176.332	One way is to listen closely.
178.634	And the other way is to share stories.
183.073	So, 15 years ago, I cofounded
183.073	an organization called Exhale
186.664	to start listening to people 
186.664	who have had abortions.
190.593	The first thing we did was create 
190.593	a talk-line, where women and men
193.963	could call to get emotional support.
196.862	Free of judgment and politics,
196.862	believe it or not, nothing like our sevice
201.064	had ever existed.
204.257	We needed a new framework that could 
204.257	hold all the experiences that we were
208.467	hearing on our talk-line.
210.934	The feminist who regrets her abortion.
213.555	The Catholic who is grateful for hers.
216.132	The personal experiences that weren't 
216.132	fitting neatly into one box or the other.
221.416	We didn't think it was right 
221.416	to ask women to pick a side.
225.467	We wanted to show them that
225.467	the whole world was on their side,
230.469	as they were going through this deeply
230.469	personal experience.
234.964	"So we invented ""pro-voice."""
238.191	Beyond abortion, pro-voice works on hard
238.191	issues that we've struggled with globally
242.751	for years,
244.022	issues like immigration, religious
244.022	tolerance, violence against women.
249.315	It also works on deeply personal topics 
249.315	that might only matter to you
253.366	and your immediate family and friends.
255.989	They have a terminal illness, 
255.989	their mother just died,
259.878	they have a child with special needs
259.878	and they can't talk about it.
265.636	Listening and storytelling are
265.636	the hallmarks of pro-voice practice.
271.302	Listening and storytelling.
273.484	That sounds pretty nice.
275.551	Sounds maybe, easy?
275.551	We could all do that.
279.15	It's not easy.
279.15	It's very hard.
282.354	Pro-voice is hard because we are talking
282.354	about things everyone's fighting about
288.233	or the things that no one 
288.233	wants to talk about.
291.409	I wish I could tell you that when you 
291.409	decide to be pro-voice, that you'll find
298.365	beautiful moments of breakthrough 
298.365	and gardens full of flowers,
302.615	where listening and storytelling
302.615	"creates wonderful ""a-ha"" moments."
307.22	I wish I could tell you that there would
307.22	be a feminist welcoming party for you,
311.279	or that there's a long-lost sisterhood
311.279	of people who are just ready
314.641	to have your back when you get slammed.
318.301	But it can be vulnerable and exhausting 
318.301	to tell our own stories
322.546	when it feels like nobody cares.
326.52	And if we truly listen to one another,
330.755	we will hear things that demand
330.755	that we shift our own perceptions.
337.921	There is no perfect time
337.921	and there is no perfect place
340.827	to start a difficult conversation.
343.811	There's never a time when everyone will be
343.811	on the same page, share the same lens,
349.414	or know the same history.
353.153	So, let's talk about listening
353.153	and how to be a good listener.
358.65	There's lots of ways to be a good listener
358.65	and I'm going to give you just a couple.
362.905	One is to ask open-ended questions.
365.807	You can ask yourself or someone 
365.807	that you know,
368.519	"""How are you feeling?"""
371.519	"""What was that like?"""
374.166	"""What do you hope for, now?"""
378.368	Another way to be a good listener 
378.368	is to use reflective language.
382.757	If someone is talking about
382.757	their own personal experience,
385.661	use the words that they use.
388.169	If someone is talking about an abortion
388.169	"and they say the word ""baby,"""
391.539	"you can say ""baby."""
393.483	"If they say ""fetus,"""
393.483	"you can say ""fetus."""
396.479	If someone describes themselves
396.479	as gender queer to you,
399.224	"you can say ""gender queer."""
401.782	If someone kind of looks like a he,
401.782	but they say they're a she -- it's cool.
405.62	Call that person a she.
408.081	When we reflect the language of the person
408.081	who is sharing their own story,
411.647	we are conveying that we are interested
411.647	in understanding who they are
417.029	and what they're going through.
419.745	The same way that we hope people are 
419.745	interested in knowing us.
425.062	So, I'll never forget being in one 
425.062	of the Exhale counselor meetings,
428.473	listening to a volunteer talk about how
428.473	she was getting a lot of calls
432.374	from Christian women who 
432.374	were talking about God.
436.114	Now, some of our volunteers are religious,
436.114	but this particular one was not.
440.247	At first, it felt a little weird for her 
440.247	to talk to callers about God.
444.852	So, she decided to get comfortable.
447.282	And she stood in front of her mirror 
447.282	"at home, and she said the word ""God."""
451.671	"""God."""
452.785	"""God."""
453.505	"""God."""
454.225	"""God."""
455.325	"""God."""
456.282	"""God."""
457.801	Over and over and over again
457.801	until the word no longer felt strange
461.081	coming out her mouth.
463.455	Saying the word God did not turn this 
463.455	volunteer into a Christian,
467.395	but it did make her a much 
467.395	better listener of Christian women.
474.693	So, another way to be pro-voice
474.693	is to share stories,
478.576	and one risk that you take on, when you
478.576	share your story with someone else,
482.796	is that given the same
482.796	set of circumstances as you
485.983	they might actually
485.983	make a different decision.
489.227	For example, if you're telling a story 
489.227	about your abortion,
493.423	realize that she might have had the baby.
498.284	She might have placed for adoption.
501.79	She might have told her parents 
501.79	and her partner -- or not.
506.503	She might have felt relief and confidence,
506.503	even though you felt sad and lost.
512.45	This is okay.
515.723	Empathy gets created the moment we
515.723	imagine ourselves in someone else's shoes.
521.606	It doesn't mean we all have 
521.606	to end up in the same place.
526.729	It's not agreement, it's not sameness
526.729	that pro-voice is after.
533.207	It creates a culture and a society that 
533.207	values what make us special and unique.
539.569	It values what makes us human,
539.569	our flaws and our imperfections.
544.932	And this way of thinking allows us to see
544.932	our differences with respect,
549.551	instead of fear.
552.386	And it generates the empathy that we need
554.6	to overcome all the ways
554.6	that we try to hurt one another.
558.026	Stigma, shame, prejudice, 
558.026	discrimination, oppression.
564.69	Pro-voice is contagious,
564.69	and the more it's practiced
569.603	the more it spreads.
575.149	So, last year I was pregnant again.
578.253	This time I was looking forward 
578.253	to the birth of my son.
582.35	And while pregnant, I had never been asked
582.35	how I was feeling so much in all my life.
588.927	(Laughter)
590.346	And however I replied, whether I was
590.346	feeling wonderful and excited
594.408	or scared and totally freaked out,
597.217	there was always someone there
597.217	"giving me a ""been there"" response."
601.578	It was awesome.
603.35	It was a welcome, yet dramatic
603.35	departure from what I experience
608.52	when I talk about
608.52	my mixed feelings of my abortion.
613.087	Pro-voice is about the real stories
613.087	of real people
616.864	making an impact on the way abortion
619.444	and so many other politicized
619.444	and stigmatized issues
623.542	are understood and discussed.
625.857	From sexuality and mental health
625.857	to poverty and incarceration.
631.562	Far beyond definition
631.562	as single right or wrong decisions,
635.05	our experiences can exist on a spectrum.
640.478	Pro-voice focuses that conversation
640.478	on human experience
644.8	and it makes support and respect
644.8	possible for all.
650.755	Thank you.
652.39	(Applause)
