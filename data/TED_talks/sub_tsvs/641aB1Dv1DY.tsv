16.804	To understand the world that live in, we tell stories.
20.773	And while remixing and sharing have come to define
24.243	the web as we know it,
25.824	all of us can now be part of that story through simple tools
29.659	that allow us to make things online.
32.124	But video has been left out. It arrived on the web
36.206	in a small box, and there it has remained,
38.952	completely disconnected from the data and the content
42.041	all around it.
43.913	In fact, in over a decade on the web, the only thing
45.825	that has changed about video is the size of the box
49.421	and the quality of the picture.
52.298	Popcorn changes all of that.
55.466	It's an online tool that allows anyone to combine video
58.579	with content pulled live directly from the web.
61.964	Videos created with Popcorn behave like the web itself:
65.499	dynamic, full of links, and completely remixable,
69.546	and finally allowed to break free from the frame.
73.845	I want to give you a demo of a prototype
76.249	that we're working on that we'll launch later this fall.
78.289	It will be completely free, and it will work in any browser.
83.235	So, every Popcorn production begins with the video,
86.301	and so I've made a short, 20-second clip
88.687	using a newscaster template that we use in workshops.
92.438	So let's watch it. We'll go back, and I'll show you how we made it.
96.122	Hi, and welcome to my newscast.
98.874	I've added my location with a Google Map,
101.315	and it's live, so try moving it around.
104.683	You can add pop-ups with live links and custom icons,
108.075	or pull in content from any web service, like Flickr,
111.539	or add articles and blog posts with links out to the full content.
116.369	So let's go back, and I'll show you what you saw. There was a lot there.
120.008	So this is the timeline, and if you've ever edited video,
123.434	you're familiar with this, but instead of clips in the timeline,
126.353	what you're looking at is web events pulled into the video.
129.939	Now in this Popcorn production we've got
132.33	the title card, we've got a Google Map that shows up
136.083	picture-in-picture, then Popcorn lets it push
138.57	outside the frame and take over the whole screen.
141.93	There are two pop-ups bringing you some other information,
144.599	and a final article with a link out to the original article.
148.977	Let's go to this Google Map, and I'll show you how you can edit it.
152.511	All you do, go into the timeline, double-click the item,
155.76	and I've set it to Toronto, because that's where I'm from.
158.019	Let's set it to something else.
161.541	Popcorn immediately goes out onto the web,
164.672	talks to Google, grabs the map, and puts it in the display.
167.729	And it's exactly the same
169.335	for the people who watch your production.
171.071	And it's live. It's not an image. So you click on it,
173.582	you zoom in, right down to street view if you want to.
177.812	Now in the video, I mentioned adding a live feed,
180.819	which we can do right now, so let's add a live feed
184	from Flickr. Go over to the right-hand side,
186.884	grab Flickr from the list of options,
189.273	drag it into the timeline,
191.52	and put it where you'd like it to go,
193.994	and it immediately goes out to Flickr and starts pulling in
196.457	images based on the tags. Now, my developers
199.469	really like ponies, and so they've set that as the default tag.
203.329	Let's try something else,
206.445	maybe something a bit more relevant to today.
210.013	Now here are live images being pulled straight from the feed.
212.743	If you come and watch this a week from now,
214.331	this will be completely different,
215.875	dynamic, just like the web, and just like the web,
218.384	everything is sourced, so click your link,
220.436	and you go straight to Flickr and see the source image.
224.229	Everything you've seen today is built with the basic
226.475	building blocks of the web: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
230.035	That means it's completely remixable. It also means
231.954	there's no proprietary software. All you need
234.518	is a web browser.
237.477	So imagine if every video that we watched on the web
240.847	worked like the web, completely remixable,
243.893	linked to its source content, and interactive
246.64	for everyone who views it.
249.021	I think Popcorn could change the way that we tell stories on
252.017	the web, and the way we understand the world we live in.
254.395	Thank you. (Applause)
