13.733	Father Daniel Berrigan once said
13.733	"that ""writing about prisoners"
16.921	"is a little like writing about the dead."""
19.72	I think what he meant is that
19.72	we treat prisoners as ghosts.
22.934	They're unseen and unheard.
25.681	It's easy to simply ignore them
27.341	and it's even easier when the government
27.341	goes to great lengths to keep them hidden.
31.754	As a journalist, I think these stories
33.993	of what people in power do
33.993	when no one is watching,
37.065	are precisely the stories
37.065	that we need to tell.
40.058	That's why I began investigating
41.621	the most secretive and experimental
41.621	prison units in the United States,
45.432	"for so-called ""second-tier"" terrorists."
49.322	The government calls these units
49.322	Communications Management Units or CMUs.
54.858	Prisoners and guards call them
54.858	"""Little Guantanamo."""
58.886	They are islands unto themselves.
61.203	But unlike Gitmo they exist
61.203	right here, at home,
65.574	floating within larger federal prisons.
69.305	There are 2 CMUs.
70.953	One was opened inside the prison
70.953	in Terre Haute, Indiana,
74.097	and the other is inside this prison,
74.097	in Marion, Illinois.
78.669	Neither of them underwent
78.669	the formal review process
81.118	that is required by law
81.118	when they were opened.
85.232	CMU prisoners have all
85.232	been convicted of crimes.
88.053	Some of their cases are questionable
88.053	and some involve threats and violence.
93.11	I'm not here to argue the guilt
93.11	or innocence of any prisoner.
96.388	I'm here because as Supreme Court Justice
96.388	Thurgood Marshall said,
99.947	"""When the prisons and gates slam shut,"
102.428	prisoners do not lose
102.428	"their human quality."""
106.515	Every prisoner I've interviewed
106.515	has said there are three flecks of light
111.206	in the darkness of prison:
113.664	phone calls,
114.886	letters
116.061	and visits from family.
118.166	CMUs aren't solitary confinement,
118.166	but they radically restrict all of these
122.093	to levels that meet or exceed the most
122.093	extreme prisons in the United States.
126.496	Their phone calls can be limited
126.496	to 45 minutes a month,
129.801	compared to the 300 minutes
129.801	other prisoners receive.
134.345	Their letters can be limited
134.345	to six pieces of paper.
137.516	Their visits can be limited
137.516	to four hours per month,
139.971	compared to the 35 hours that people
139.971	like Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph
145.701	receive in the supermax.
148.215	On top of that, CMU visits are non-contact
148.215	which means prisoners are not allowed
153.227	to even hug their family.
156.093	As one CMU prisoner said,
158.043	"""We're not being tortured here,"
158.043	"except psychologically."""
162.893	The government won't say
162.893	who is imprisoned here.
165.75	But through court documents,
165.75	open records requests
169.401	and interviews with current
169.401	and former prisoners,
171.983	some small windows
171.983	into the CMUs have opened.
176.005	There's an estimated
179.111	and they're overwhelmingly Muslim.
181.825	They include people like Dr. Rafil Dhafir,
185.017	who violated the economic sanctions
185.017	on Iraq by sending medical supplies
189.065	for the children there.
191.967	They've included people like Yassin Aref.
194.892	Aref and his family fled to New York
194.892	from Saddam Hussein's Iraq as refugees.
200.094	He was arrested in 2004
200.094	as part of an FBI sting.
204.784	Aref is an imam and he was asked
204.784	to bear witness to a loan,
208.282	which is a tradition in Islamic culture.
210.703	It turned out that one of the people
210.703	involved in the loan was trying to enlist
214.543	someone else in a fake attack.
217.452	Aref didn't know.
219.561	For that, he was convicted
220.855	of conspiracy to provide material support
220.855	to a terrorist group.
226.309	The CMUs also include
226.309	some non-Muslim prisoners.
229.563	"The guards call them ""balancers,"""
232.39	meaning they help balance out
232.39	the racial numbers,
235.278	in hopes of deflecting law suits.
238.223	These balancers include animal rights
238.223	and environmental activists
241.889	like Daniel McGowan.
243.643	McGowan was convicted
243.643	of participating in two arsons
246.453	in the name of defending the environment
248.589	as part of the Earth Liberation Front.
251.69	During his sentencing, he was afraid
251.69	that he would be sent
254.462	to a rumored secret prison for terrorists.
257.56	The judge dismissed all those fears,
259.448	saying that they
259.448	weren't supported by any facts.
262.606	But that might be because the government
262.606	hasn't fully explained
265.885	why some prisoners end up in a CMU,
268.311	and who is responsible
268.311	for these decisions.
272.142	When McGowan was transferred, he was told
274.201	"it's because he is a ""domestic terrorist,"""
277.627	a term the FBI uses repeatedly when
277.627	talking about environmental activists.
282.978	Now, keep in mind there are about 400
282.978	prisoners in US prisons
286.773	who are classified as terrorists,
288.56	and only a handful of them
288.56	are in the CMUs.
291.169	In McGowan's case, he was previously
291.169	at a low-security prison
294.816	and he had no communications violations.
299.354	So, why was he moved?
302.173	Like other CMU prisoners,
303.534	McGowan repeatedly asked
303.534	for an answer, a hearing,
307.448	or some opportunity for an appeal.
310.434	This example from another prisoner
310.434	shows how those requests are viewed.
315.241	"""Wants a transfer."" ""Told him no."""
319.366	At one point, the prison warden himself
319.366	recommended McGowan's transfer
323.117	out of the CMU citing his good behavior,
326.414	but the warden was overruled
328.479	by the Bureau of Prison's
328.479	Counterterrorism Unit,
331.717	working with the Joint Terrorism
331.717	Task Force of the FBI.
335.571	Later I found out that McGowan
335.571	was really sent to a CMU
338.211	not because of what he did,
340.154	but what he has said.
342.149	A memo from the Counterterrorism Unit
342.149	"cited McGowan's ""anti-government beliefs."""
348.333	While imprisoned, he continued writing
348.333	about environmental issues,
351.868	saying that activists must
351.868	reflect on their mistakes
354.71	and listen to each other.
356.76	Now, in fairness, if you've spent
356.76	any time at all in Washington, DC,
360.045	you know this is really a radical
360.045	concept for the government.
364.408	(Laughter)
366.809	I actually asked to visit
366.809	McGowan in the CMU.
370.328	And I was approved.
372.46	That came as quite a shock.
374.578	First, because as I've discussed
374.578	on this stage before,
379.603	I learned that the FBI has been
379.603	monitoring my work.
383.43	Second, because it would make me the first
383.43	and only journalist to visit a CMU.
389.189	I had even learned
390.371	through the Bureau of Prisons
390.371	Counterterrorism Unit,
393.601	that they had been monitoring my speeches
393.601	about CMUs, like this one.
399.128	So how could I possibly
399.128	be approved to visit?
403.222	A few days before I went
403.222	out to the prison, I got an answer.
408.471	I was allowed to visit McGowan
408.471	as a friend, not a journalist.
412.86	Journalists are not allowed here.
414.972	McGowan was told by CMU officials
414.972	that if I asked any questions
418.541	or published any story,
420.484	that he would be punished
420.484	for my reporting.
424.308	When I arrived for our visit,
424.308	the guards reminded me
426.796	that they knew who I was
426.796	and knew about my work.
429.094	And they said that if I attempted
429.094	to interview McGowan,
431.698	the visit would be terminated.
434.671	The Bureau of Prisons describes CMUs
434.671	"as ""self-contained housing units."""
440.515	But I think that's an Orwellian way
440.515	of describing black holes.
444.805	When you visit a CMU,
445.981	you go through all the security
445.981	checkpoints that you would expect.
449.131	But then the walk
449.131	to the visitation room is silent.
453.756	When a CMU prisoner has a visit,
453.756	the rest of the prison is on lockdown.
459.112	I was ushered into a small room,
460.962	so small my outstretched arms
460.962	could touch each wall.
464.761	There was a grapefruit-sized
464.761	orb in the ceiling
467.58	for the visit to be live-monitored
467.58	by the Counterterrorism Unit
470.779	in West Virginia.
472.64	The unit insists that all the visits
472.64	have to be in English for CMU prisoners,
477.023	which is an additional hardship
477.023	for many of the Muslim families.
480.634	There is a thick sheet of foggy,
480.634	bulletproof glass
484.04	and on the other side was Daniel McGowan.
488.104	We spoke through these handsets
488.104	attached to the wall
490.986	and talked about books and movies.
493.334	We did our best to find reasons to laugh.
496.554	To fight boredom and amuse himself
496.554	while in the CMU,
499.745	McGowan had been spreading a rumor
499.745	that I was secretly the president
503.849	of a Twilight fan club in Washington, DC
507.844	(Laughter)
509.836	For the record, I'm not.
512.209	(Laughter)
513.754	But I kind of the hope the FBI
513.754	now thinks that Bella and Edward
517.376	are terrorist code names.
519.546	(Laughter)
522.073	During our visit, McGowan spoke most
522.073	and at length about his niece Lily,
528.539	his wife Jenny and how torturous
528.539	it feels to never be able to hug them,
534.687	to never be able to hold their hands.
538.227	Three months after our visit, McGowan
538.227	was transferred out of the CMU
541.774	and then, without warning,
541.774	he was sent back again.
545.956	I had published leaked
545.956	CMU documents on my website
550.22	and the Counterterrorism Unit said
550.22	that McGowan had called his wife
553.465	and asked her to mail them.
556.307	He wanted to see what the government
556.307	was saying about him,
559.064	and for that he was sent back to the CMU.
561.982	When he was finally released
561.982	at the end of his sentence,
564.656	his story got even more Kafkaesque.
567.434	He wrote an article
567.434	for the Huffington Post headlined,
569.998	"""Court Documents Prove I was Sent to"
569.998	"a CMU for my Political Speech."""
574.122	The next day he was thrown
574.122	back in jail for his political speech.
580.923	His attorneys quickly secured his release,
582.98	but the message was very clear:
585.602	Don't talk about this place.
588.472	Today, nine years after they were opened
588.472	by the Bush administration,
593.089	the government is codifying
593.089	how and why CMUs were created.
597.706	According to the Bureau of Prisons,
599.402	they are for prisoners
599.402	"with ""inspirational significance."""
604.325	I think that is very nice way of saying
604.325	these are political prisons
608.553	for political prisoners.
610.764	Prisoners are sent to a CMU
610.764	because of their race,
613.544	their religion or their
613.544	political beliefs.
616.77	Now, if you think that
616.77	characterization is too strong,
619.615	just look at some
619.615	of the government's own documents.
622.456	When some of McGowan's mail was rejected
622.456	by the CMU, the sender was told
626.996	it's because the letters were intended
626.996	"""for political prisoners."""
631.41	When another prisoner, animal rights
631.41	activist Andy Stepanian,
635.252	was sent to a CMU, it was because of his
635.252	anti-government and anti-corporate views.
641.722	Now, I know all of this
641.722	may be hard to believe,
644.716	that it's happening right now,
644.716	and in the United States.
649.159	But the unknown reality
649.159	is that the US has a dark history
652.819	of disproportionately punishing people
652.819	because of their political beliefs.
657.67	In the 1960s, before Marion
657.67	was home to the CMU,
662.14	it was home to the notorious Control Unit.
665.574	Prisoners were locked down
665.574	in solitary for 22 hours a day.
670.24	The warden said the unit
670.24	"was to ""control revolutionary attitudes."""
676.846	In the 1980s, another experiment called
676.846	the Lexington High Security Unit
681.817	held women connected
681.817	to the Weather Underground,
684.269	Black Liberation and Puerto Rican
684.269	independent struggles.
687.987	The prison radically restricted
687.987	communication and used sleep deprivation,
692.257	and constant light for so-called
692.257	"""ideological conversion."""
697.976	Those prisons were eventually shut down,
697.976	but only through the campaigning
703.092	of religious groups and human rights
703.092	advocates, like Amnesty International.
708.398	Today, civil rights lawyers
708.398	with the Center for Constitutional Rights
712.348	are challenging CMUs in court
714.751	for depriving prisoners
714.751	of their due process rights
717.33	and for retaliating against them
719.434	for their protected political
719.434	and religious speech.
723.296	Many of these documents would have
723.296	never come to light without this lawsuit.
728.398	The message of these groups
728.398	and my message for you today
733.053	is that we must bear witness
733.053	to what is being done to these prisoners.
736.833	Their treatment is a reflection
736.833	of the values held beyond prison walls.
742.339	This story is not just about prisoners.
744.979	It is about us.
747.027	It is about our own commitment
747.027	to human rights.
749.798	It is about whether we will choose to stop
749.798	repeating the mistakes of our past.
755.077	If we don't listen to what Father Berrigan
755.077	described as the stories of the dead,
760.133	they will soon become
760.133	the stories of ourselves.
762.9	Thank you.
764.074	(Applause)
771.437	(Applause ends)
773.849	Tom Rielly: I have a couple questions.
775.708	When I was in high school,
775.708	I learned about the Bill of Rights,
779.66	the Constitution, freedom of speech,
782.58	due process and 
782.58	about 25 other laws and rights
787.137	that seem to be violated by this.
789.706	How could this possibly be happening?
792.434	Will Potter: I think that's
792.434	the number one question I get
795.149	throughout all of my work,
797.16	and the short answer is
797.16	that people don't know.
800.809	I think the solution to any of these types
800.809	of situations, any rights abuses,
804.724	are really dependent on two things.
806.441	They're dependent on knowledge
806.441	that it's actually happening
809.261	and then a means and efficacy
809.261	to actually make a change.
813.567	And unfortunately with these prisoners,
815.988	one, people don't know
815.988	what's happening at all
818.587	and then they're already
818.587	disenfranchised populations
821.199	who don't have access to attorneys,
821.199	not native English speakers.
825.255	In some of these cases, they have great
825.255	representation that I mentioned,
828.689	but there's just not a public awareness
828.689	of what's happening.
831.775	TR: Isn't it guaranteed in prison
831.775	that you have right to council
834.839	or access to council?
836.404	WP: There's a tendency in our culture
838.21	to see when people have been
838.21	convicted of a crime,
841.344	no matter if that charge
841.344	was bogus or legitimate,
843.726	that whatever happens to them
843.726	after that is warranted.
846.716	And I think that's a really damaging
846.716	and dangerous narrative that we have,
850.234	that allows these types
850.234	of things to happen,
852.718	as the general public just
852.718	kind of turns a blind eye to it.
856.145	TR: All those documents on screen
856.145	were all real documents, word for word,
861.105	unchanged at all, right?
863.178	WP: Absolutely. I've actually uploaded
863.178	all of them to my website.
866.538	It's willpotter.com/CMU and it's
866.538	a footnoted version of the talk,
871.439	so you can see the documents for yourself
871.439	without the little snippets.
874.781	You can see the full version.
876.193	I relied overwhelmingly
876.193	on primary source documents
879.162	or on primary interviews
879.162	with former and current prisoners,
882.502	with people that are dealing
882.502	with this situation every day.
885.312	And like I said, I've been
885.312	there myself, as well.
887.654	TR: You're doing courageous work.
889.384	WP: Thank you very much. Thank you all.
891.564	(Applause)
