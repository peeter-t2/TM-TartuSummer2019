16.196	So I'm going to talk about work;
17.91	specifically, why people can't
17.91	seem to get work done at work,
21.72	which is a problem we all kind of have.
24.173	But let's sort of start at the beginning.
26.36	So, we have companies
26.36	and non-profits and charities
29.99	and all these groups that have
29.99	employees or volunteers of some sort.
35.458	And they expect these people
35.458	who work for them
39.188	to do great work --
40.894	I would hope, at least.
42.26	At least good work, hopefully,
42.26	at least it's good work --
44.999	hopefully great work.
46.26	And so what they typically
46.26	do is they decide
48.332	that all these people need to come
48.332	together in one place to do that work.
52.26	So a company, or a charity,
52.26	or an organization of any kind,
55.259	unless you're working in Africa,
55.259	if you're really lucky to do that --
59.447	most people have to go
59.447	to an office every day.
61.704	And so these companies,
63.664	they build offices.
65.413	They go out and they buy a building,
65.413	or they rent a building,
68.333	or they lease some space,
70.26	and they fill this space with stuff.
73.26	They fill it with tables, or desks,
76.26	chairs, computer equipment,
79.159	software, Internet access,
82.26	maybe a fridge, maybe a few other things,
85.529	and they expect their employees,
85.529	or their volunteers,
88.134	to come to that location
88.134	every day to do great work.
90.807	It seems like it's perfectly
90.807	reasonable to ask that.
93.752	However, if you actually talk to people
96.109	and even question yourself,
96.109	and you ask yourself,
98.777	where do you really want to go when you
98.777	really need to get something done?
102.315	You'll find out that people don't say
102.315	what businesses think they would say.
106.065	If you ask people the question:
107.586	Where do you need to go
107.586	when you need to get something done?
110.426	Typically, you get three different
110.426	kinds of answers.
112.924	One is kind of a place
112.924	or a location or a room.
115.811	Another one is a moving object,
117.779	and a third is a time.
119.47	So here are some examples.
121.506	I've been asking people this question
121.506	for about 10 years:
124.761	"""Where do you go when you"
124.761	"really need to get something done?"""
127.941	I'll hear things like, the porch,
127.941	the deck, the kitchen.
131.513	I'll hear things like
131.513	an extra room in the house,
134.585	the basement,
135.886	the coffee shop, the library.
138.807	And then you'll hear
138.807	things like the train,
141.386	a plane, a car -- so, the commute.
144.926	And then you'll hear people say,
146.662	"""Well, it doesn't really"
146.662	matter where I am,
148.688	as long as it's early in the morning
148.688	"or late at night or on the weekends."""
152.224	You almost never hear
152.224	"someone say, ""The office."""
155.073	But businesses are spending all this money
155.073	on this place called the office,
158.669	and they're making people
158.669	go to it all the time,
160.947	yet people don't do work in the office.
163.006	What is that about?
164.193	(Laughter)
165.677	Why is that? Why is that happening?
169.353	And what you find out is,
170.647	if you dig a little bit deeper,
170.647	you find out that people --
174.059	this is what happens:
175.733	People go to work,
177.486	and they're basically
177.486	trading in their work day
179.82	"for a series of ""work moments"" --"
179.82	that's what happens at the office.
183.336	You don't have a work day anymore.
183.336	You have work moments.
186.043	It's like the front door
186.043	of the office is like a Cuisinart,
188.845	and you walk in and your day
188.845	is shredded to bits,
191.171	because you have 15 minutes here,
193.743	and something else happens,
193.743	you're pulled off your work,
196.49	then you have 20 minutes, then it's lunch,
196.49	then you have something else to do ...
200.403	Then you've got 15 minutes, and someone
200.403	pulls you aside and asks you a question,
204.237	and before you know it, it's 5 p.m.,
206.457	and you look back on the day,
208.053	and you realize that you
208.053	didn't get anything done.
211.108	We've all been through this.
212.489	We probably went through it yesterday
212.489	or the day before, or the day before that.
216.316	You look back on your day,
217.754	and you're like,
217.754	"""I got nothing done today."
219.794	I was at work. I sat at my desk.
219.794	I used my expensive computer.
224.408	I used the software they told me to use.
226.669	I went to these meetings
226.669	I was asked to go to.
229.146	I did these conference calls.
229.146	I did all this stuff.
231.867	But I didn't actually do anything.
234.692	I just did tasks.
235.868	I didn't actually get
235.868	"meaningful work done."""
238.707	And what you find is that,
238.707	especially with creative people --
241.667	designers, programmers,
241.667	writers, engineers, thinkers --
247.26	that people really need long stretches
247.26	of uninterrupted time
251.172	to get something done.
252.518	You cannot ask somebody
252.518	to be creative in 15 minutes
255.97	and really think about a problem.
257.613	You might have a quick idea,
259.003	but to be in deep thought about a problem
259.003	and really consider a problem carefully,
262.986	you need long stretches
262.986	of uninterrupted time.
265.871	And even though the work day
265.871	is typically eight hours,
268.597	how many people here have ever had
268.597	eight hours to themselves at the office?
272.176	How about seven hours?
273.367	Six? Five? Four?
276.599	When's the last time you had
276.599	three hours to yourself at the office?
279.775	Two hours? One, maybe?
281.821	Very, very few people actually have
283.56	long stretches of uninterrupted
283.56	time at an office.
286.258	And this is why people
286.258	choose to do work at home,
289.812	or they might go to the office,
291.415	but they might go to the office
291.415	really early in the day,
294.074	or late at night when no one's around,
295.924	or they stick around
295.924	after everyone's left,
298.016	or go in on the weekends,
299.454	or they get work done on the plane,
299.454	in the car or in the train,
302.569	because there are no distractions.
304.498	Now there are different
304.498	kinds of distractions,
306.717	but not the really bad distractions,
306.717	which I'll talk about in a minute.
310.13	And this whole phenomenon of having
310.13	short bursts of time to get things done
314.618	reminds me of another thing
314.618	that doesn't work when you're interrupted,
318.284	and that is sleep.
320.031	I think that sleep and work
320.031	are very closely related --
323.244	not because you can work while you're
323.244	sleeping and sleep while you're working.
326.966	That's not really what I mean.
328.434	I'm talking specifically about the fact
328.434	that sleep and work are phase-based,
334.529	or stage-based, events.
336.584	Sleep is about sleep phases, or stages --
336.584	some people call them different things.
342.663	There are five of them, and in order
342.663	to get to the really deep ones,
346.521	the meaningful ones,
346.521	you have to go through the early ones.
349.314	If you're interrupted while you're
349.314	going through the early ones --
352.529	if someone bumps you in bed,
352.529	or there's a sound, or whatever happens --
356.26	you don't just pick up where you left off.
358.284	If you're interrupted and woken up,
360.26	you have to start again.
362.022	So you have to go back
362.022	a few phases and start again.
365.26	And what ends up happening --
365.26	you might have days like this
368.051	where you wake up at eight or seven
368.051	in the morning, or whenever you get up,
371.623	and you're like,
371.623	"""I didn't sleep very well."
373.763	I did the sleep thing --
373.763	I went to bed, I laid down,
376.355	"but I didn't really sleep."""
378.757	"People say you go ""to"" sleep,"
381.147	but you don't go to sleep,
381.147	you go towards sleep; it takes a while.
384.289	You've got to go through phases and stuff,
386.368	and if you're interrupted,
386.368	you don't sleep well.
388.701	So does anyone here
388.701	expect someone to sleep well
391.081	if they're interrupted all night?
392.687	I don't think anyone would say yes.
394.425	Why do we expect people to work well
396.774	if they're being interrupted
396.774	all day at the office?
399.27	How can we possibly expect
399.27	people to do their job
401.728	if they go to the office
401.728	and are interrupted?
403.857	That doesn't really seem
403.857	like it makes a lot of sense, to me.
406.788	So what are the interruptions that happen
406.788	at the office but not at other places?
410.68	Because in other places, you can have
410.68	interruptions like the TV,
414.965	or you could go for a walk,
414.965	or there's a fridge downstairs,
418.26	or you've got your own couch,
418.26	or whatever you want to do.
421.389	If you talk to certain managers,
421.389	they'll tell you
424.222	that they don't want
424.222	their employees to work at home
426.817	because of these distractions.
428.738	They'll sometimes also say,
431.793	"""If I can't see the person,"
431.793	"how do I know they're working?"""
434.66	which is ridiculous, but that's one
434.66	of the excuses that managers give.
437.985	And I'm one of these managers.
437.985	I understand. I know how this goes.
441.266	We all have to improve
441.266	on this sort of thing.
444.013	But oftentimes they'll cite distractions:
446.007	"""I can't let someone work at home."
447.665	"They'll watch TV, or do this other thing."""
449.705	It turns out those aren't
449.705	the things that are distracting,
452.464	Because those are voluntary distractions.
454.444	You decide when you want
454.444	to be distracted by the TV,
456.92	when you want to turn something on,
458.635	or when you want to go
458.635	downstairs or go for a walk.
461.053	At the office,
462.228	most of the interruptions and distractions
464.275	that really cause people not
464.275	to get work done are involuntary.
467.416	So let's go through a couple of those.
470.551	Now, managers and bosses
470.551	will often have you think
473.892	that the real distractions at work
475.92	are things like Facebook and Twitter
478.754	and YouTube and other websites,
481.948	and in fact, they'll go so far
481.948	as to actually ban these sites at work.
485.814	Some of you may work at places
485.814	where you can't get to certain sites.
489.179	I mean, is this China?
489.179	What the hell is going on here?
491.822	You can't go to a website at work,
491.822	and that's the problem?
494.589	That's why people aren't
494.589	getting work done,
496.621	because they're on Facebook and Twitter?
498.573	That's kind of ridiculous.
498.573	It's a total decoy.
501.557	Today's Facebook and Twitter and YouTube,
504.998	these things are just
504.998	modern-day smoke breaks.
507.26	No one cared about letting people take
507.26	a smoke break for 15 minutes 10 years ago,
511.299	so why does anyone care
511.299	if someone goes to Facebook
513.941	or Twitter or YouTube here and there?
516.076	Those aren't the real
516.076	problems in the office.
518.677	The real problems are
518.677	what I like to call the M&amp;Ms,
522.312	the Managers and the Meetings.
524.589	Those are the real problems
524.589	in the modern office today.
528.002	And this is why
528.002	things don't get done at work,
530.506	it's because of the M&amp;Ms.
532.33	Now what's interesting is,
534.656	if you listen to all the places
534.656	that people talk about doing work,
537.821	like at home, in the car, on a plane,
537.821	late at night, or early in the morning,
541.809	you don't find managers and meetings.
543.964	You find a lot of other distractions,
543.964	but not managers and meetings.
547.225	So these are the things
547.225	that you don't find elsewhere,
550.226	but you do find at the office.
552.631	And managers are basically people
552.631	whose job it is to interrupt people.
556.006	That's pretty much what managers are for.
556.006	They're for interrupting people.
559.522	They don't really do the work, so they
559.522	make sure everyone else is doing work,
563.385	which is an interruption.
565.133	We have lots of managers in the world now,
565.133	and a lot of people in the world,
568.751	and a lot of interruptions
568.751	by these managers.
570.876	They have to check in:
570.876	"""Hey, how's it going?"
572.953	"Show me what's up."" This sort of thing."
574.861	They keep interrupting you
574.861	at the wrong time,
577.043	while you're actually trying to do
577.043	something they're paying you to do,
580.368	they tend to interrupt you.
581.795	That's kind of bad.
583.382	But what's even worse is the thing
583.382	that managers do most of all,
586.517	which is call meetings.
587.988	And meetings are just toxic,
590.558	terrible, poisonous things
593.584	during the day at work.
595.027	(Laughter)
596.267	We all know this to be true,
598.078	and you would never see a spontaneous
598.078	meeting called by employees.
601.323	It doesn't work that way.
602.608	The manager calls the meeting
604.36	so the employees can all come together,
606.299	and it's an incredibly disruptive
606.299	thing to do to people --
609.046	"to say, ""Hey look,"
610.26	we're going to bring 10 people
610.26	together right now and have a meeting.
613.982	I don't care what you're doing,
615.498	you've got to stop doing it,
615.498	"so you can have this meeting."""
618.529	I mean, what are the chances
618.529	that all 10 people are ready to stop?
621.927	What if they're thinking about something
621.927	important, or doing important work?
625.704	All of a sudden you tell them they have
625.704	to stop doing that to do something else.
629.517	So they go into a meeting room,
629.517	they get together,
632.26	and they talk about stuff
632.26	that doesn't really matter, usually.
635.556	Because meetings aren't work.
637.224	Meetings are places to go
637.224	to talk about things
639.414	you're supposed to be doing later.
641.135	But meetings also procreate.
643.13	So one meeting tends
643.13	to lead to another meeting,
645.419	which leads to another meeting.
646.928	There's often too many people
646.928	in the meetings,
649.158	and they're very, very expensive
649.158	to the organization.
651.907	Companies often think of a one-hour
651.907	meeting as a one-hour meeting,
655.056	but that's not true,
655.056	unless there's only one person.
657.541	If there are 10 people, it's a 10-hour
657.541	meeting, not a one-hour meeting.
661.089	It's 10 hours of productivity taken
661.089	from the rest of the organization
664.39	to have this one-hour meeting,
664.39	which probably should have been handled
667.753	by two or three people
667.753	talking for a few minutes.
670.26	But instead, there's a long
670.26	scheduled meeting,
672.823	because meetings are scheduled
672.823	the way software works,
675.418	which is in increments of 15 minutes,
675.418	or 30 minutes, or an hour.
678.843	You don't schedule an eight-hour meeting
678.843	with Outlook; you can't.
682.51	You can go 15 minutes or 30 minutes
682.51	or 45 minutes or an hour.
685.508	And so we tend to fill these times up
687.506	when things should go really quickly.
689.689	So meetings and managers are
689.689	two major problems in businesses today,
693.363	especially at offices.
694.546	These things don't exist
694.546	outside of the office.
697.688	So I have some suggestions
697.688	to remedy the situation.
702.513	What can managers do --
704.26	enlightened managers, hopefully --
706.26	what can they do to make the office
706.26	a better place for people to work,
709.756	so it's not the last resort,
709.756	but it's the first resort,
712.625	so that people start to say,
713.991	"""When I really want to get stuff done,"
713.991	"I go to the office."""
716.792	Because the offices are well-equipped;
718.73	everything is there
718.73	for them to do the work.
720.888	But they don't want to go there right
720.888	now, so how do we change that?
724.173	I have three suggestions
724.173	to share with you.
726.231	I have about three minutes,
726.231	so that'll fit perfectly.
729.126	We've all heard
729.126	of the Casual Friday thing.
731.987	I don't know if people still do that.
733.86	"But how about ""No-talk Thursdays?"""
735.56	(Laughter)
737.616	Pick one Thursday once a month,
740.586	and cut it in half, just the afternoon --
740.586	I'll make it easy for you.
743.921	So just the afternoon, one Thursday.
745.675	First Thursday of the month,
745.675	just the afternoon,
747.953	nobody in the office
747.953	can talk to each other.
750.041	Just silence, that's it.
751.603	And what you'll find
753.26	is that a tremendous amount
753.26	of work gets done
755.692	when no one talks to each other.
757.32	This is when people
757.32	actually get stuff done,
759.408	is when no one's bothering them
759.408	or interrupting them.
761.948	Giving someone four hours
761.948	of uninterrupted time
764.933	is the best gift you can
764.933	give anybody at work.
767.131	It's better than a computer,
768.568	better than a new monitor,
768.568	better than new software,
771.346	or whatever people typically use.
773.345	Giving them four hours
773.345	of quiet time at the office
775.773	is going to be incredibly valuable.
777.718	If you try that, I think you'll agree,
777.718	and hopefully you can do it more often.
781.71	So maybe it's every other week,
783.456	or every week, once a week,
785.26	afternoons no one can talk to each other.
787.337	That's something that you'll find
787.337	will really, really work.
790.448	Another thing you can try,
792.774	is switching from active
792.774	communication and collaboration,
796.26	which is like face-to-face stuff --
796.26	tapping people on the shoulder,
799.475	saying hi to them, having meetings,
801.475	and replace that with more
801.475	passive models of communication,
804.285	using things like email
804.285	and instant messaging,
806.61	or collaboration products,
806.61	things like that.
809.888	Now some people might say
809.888	email is really distracting,
812.833	I.M. is really distracting, and these
812.833	other things are really distracting,
816.427	but they're distracting at a time
816.427	of your own choice and your own choosing.
820.023	You can quit the email app;
820.023	you can't quit your boss.
822.855	You can quit I.M.;
824.657	you can't hide your manager.
826.498	You can put these things away,
828.26	and then you can be interrupted
828.26	on your own schedule, at your own time,
831.665	when you're available,
831.665	when you're ready to go again.
834.166	Because work, like sleep,
834.166	happens in phases.
836.26	So you'll be going up, doing some work,
838.377	and then you'll come down from that work,
840.36	and then maybe it's time
840.36	to check that email or I.M.
842.836	There are very, very few things
842.836	that are that urgent,
845.361	that need to happen, that need
845.361	to be answered right this second.
848.432	So if you're a manager,
849.631	start encouraging people to use
849.631	more things like I.M. and email
852.639	and other things that someone can put away
854.679	and then get back to you
854.679	on their own schedule.
856.904	And the last suggestion I have is that,
860.507	if you do have a meeting coming up,
862.26	if you have the power, just cancel it.
865.91	Just cancel that next meeting.
867.394	(Laughter)
868.584	Today's Friday, usually people
868.584	have meetings on Monday.
871.253	Just don't have it.
872.439	I don't mean move it;
873.868	I mean just erase it
873.868	from memory, it's gone.
876.534	And you'll find out that everything
876.534	will be just fine.
879.146	All these discussions and decisions
879.146	you thought you had to make
882.186	at this one time at 9 a.m. on Monday,
883.994	just forget about them,
883.994	and things will be fine.
886.315	People will have a more open morning,
886.315	they can actually think.
889.32	You'll find out all these things
889.32	you thought you had to do,
892.119	you don't actually have to do.
893.596	So those are just three quick suggestions
893.596	I wanted to give you guys to think about.
897.612	I hope that some of these ideas
897.612	were at least provocative enough
900.661	for managers and bosses
900.661	and business owners
902.791	and organizers and people
902.791	who are in charge of other people,
905.631	to think about laying off a little bit,
907.526	and giving people more time
907.526	to get work done.
909.685	I think it'll all pay off in the end.
911.519	So, thanks for listening.
913.545	(Applause)
