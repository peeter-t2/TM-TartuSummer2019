12.914	Good afternoon.
14.241	My name is Uldus.
15.782	I am a photo-based artist from Russia.
19.755	I started my way around six years ago
22.784	with ironic self-portraits
25.81	to lay open so many stereotypes
28.78	about nationalities, genders,
32.222	and social issues —
33.662	"[""I am Russian. I sell drugs, guns, porno with kids!""]"
33.662	"[""Vodka = water. I love vodka!""] (Laughter) —"
36.665	using photography as my tool to send a message.
36.665	"[""Marry me, I need a visa.""]"
41.233	Today, I am still performing in front of the camera
44.315	and trying to be brave like Wonder Woman.
48.162	I focus on balancing meaningful message,
51.84	aesthetic, beauty, composition, 
51.84	some irony, and artifacts.
57.87	Today, I'm going to tell you about my project,
61.312	which is named Desperate Romantics.
64.271	They're my artifacts, or paintings
65.989	from pre-Raphaelites Brotherhood England
70.817	mid-19th century.
72.926	I took the painting
74.94	and gifted new, contemporary meaning
78.182	talking about issues which are surrounding me
82.037	in Russia,
83.377	capturing people who are non-models
86.698	but have an interesting story.
89.78	This boy is a professional dancer,
91.929	only 12 years old,
93.512	but at secondary school, he hides his dancing classes
97.44	and is wearing the mask of brutality,
99.821	trying to be united with the rest of his classmates
104.145	like a storm trooper has no personality.
106.877	But this boy has goals and dreams
109.577	but hides it to be socially accepted,
112.57	because being different isn't easy,
115.218	especially in Russia.
117.515	Next portrait interpretation is metaphoric.
121.261	And this is Nikita,
123.376	a security guard from one of the bars
126.74	in St. Petersburg.
128.607	"He likes to say, ""You wouldn't like me when I'm angry,"""
132.207	quoting Hulk from the movie,
134.198	but I've never seen him angry.
136.442	He hides his sensitivities and romantic side,
139.947	because in Russia, among guys,
141.938	that's not cool to be romantic,
143.772	but it's cool to be surrounded with women
146.52	and look like an aggressive hulk.
148.823	(Laughter)
151.1	Sometimes, in my project,
153.48	I would take the painting
155.35	and give it new meaning
158.205	and new temptation about it.
161.04	Sometimes, I would compare facial features
164.572	and playing with words:
166.858	irony, Iron Man, ironing man.
171.232	(Laughter)
174.527	Through the artifacts,
176.02	I bring social issues
178.1	which surround me in Russia into the conversation.
181.806	Interesting fact about marriage in Russia,
184.809	that most of the 18, 19-year-old girls
188.285	are already ready, and dream to get married.
191.525	We're taught from childhood,
193.1	successful marriage means successful life,
196.385	so most of the girls kind of fight
198.949	to get a good husband.
201.534	And what about me?
203.787	I'm 27 years old.
205.822	For Russian society, I'm an old maid
208.703	and hopeless to ever get married.
211.526	That's why you see me in a Mexican fighter mask,
214.822	in the wedding dress, all desperate in my garden.
219.209	But remember, irony is the key,
221.93	and this is actually to motivate girls
224.283	to fight for goals, for dreams,
227.185	and change stereotypes.
230.481	Be brave. Be ironic — it helps.
233.823	Be funny and create some magic.
237.962	(Applause)
