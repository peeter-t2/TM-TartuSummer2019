18.599	People love their automobiles.
20.242	They allow us to go
20.242	where we want to when we want to.
23.33	They're a form of entertainment,
24.969	they're a form of art,
26.994	a pride of ownership.
28.7	Songs are written about cars.
30.393	Prince wrote a great song:
30.393	"""Little Red Corvette."""
32.752	"He didn't write ""Little Red Laptop"
32.752	"Computer"" or ""Little Red Dirt Devil."""
36.226	He wrote about a car.
37.444	One of my favorites has always been:
39.33	"""Make Love to Your Man in a Chevy Van,"""
41.329	because that was my vehicle
41.329	when I was in college.
44.709	The fact is, when we do
44.709	our market research around the world,
48.142	we see there's a nearly universal
48.142	aspiration on the part of people
52.159	to own an automobile --
	in the world today own a car.
58.127	And you say, boy, that's a lot.
59.696	But you know what?
60.876	That's just 12 percent of the population.
63.035	We really have to ask the question:
65.193	Can the world sustain
65.193	that number of automobiles?
67.936	And if you look at projections
67.936	over the next 10 to 15 to 20 years,
71.828	it looks like the world
71.828	car park could grow
75.148	to on the order of 1.1 billion vehicles.
78.107	If you park those end to end
78.107	and wrap them around the Earth,
81.806	that would stretch
81.806	around the Earth 125 times.
85.176	Now, we've made great progress
85.176	with automobile technology
88.486	over the last 100 years.
90.151	Cars are dramatically cleaner,
90.151	dramatically safer, more efficient
94.012	and radically more affordable
94.012	than they were 100 years ago.
97.736	But the fact remains:
99.329	the fundamental DNA of the automobile
99.329	has stayed pretty much the same.
103.829	If we were to reinvent the automobile
103.829	today, rather than 100 years ago,
108.121	knowing what we know about the issues
108.121	associated with our product
111.95	and about the technologies
111.95	that exist today,
114.433	what would we do?
115.652	We wanted something
115.652	that was really affordable.
117.916	The fuel cell looked great:
119.623	one-tenth as many moving parts,
121.368	a fuel-cell propulsion system
121.368	as an internal combustion engine,
124.517	and it emits just water.
125.746	And we wanted to take
125.746	advantage of Moore's Law
128.132	with electronic controls and software,
129.997	and we absolutely wanted
129.997	our car to be connected.
133.06	So we embarked upon the reinvention
133.06	around an electrochemical engine,
136.964	the fuel cell,
138.144	and hydrogen as the energy carrier.
140.152	First was Autonomy.
141.685	Autonomy really set the vision
141.685	for where we wanted to head.
144.766	We embodied all of the key components
144.766	of a fuel-cell propulsion system.
148.83	We then had Autonomy
148.83	drivable with Hy-Wire,
151.525	and we showed Hy-Wire here
151.525	at this conference last year.
154.83	Hy-Wire is the world's first
154.83	drivable fuel cell,
158.017	and we have followed
158.017	up that now with Sequel.
160.83	And Sequel truly is a real car.
162.83	So if we could run the video --
165.189	(Futuristic music)
173.11	[Reinventing the Automobile]
212.124	(Video) It truly is my great pleasure
212.124	to introduce Sequel.
232.125	[Acceleration]
236.506	[Cruising]
240.463	[Steering]
244.527	[Braking]
251.147	But the real key question
251.147	I'm sure that's on your mind:
253.924	Where is the hydrogen going to come from?
255.924	And secondly, when are these kinds
255.924	of cars going to be available?
259.114	So let me talk about hydrogen first.
261.338	The beauty of hydrogen is it can come
261.338	from so many different sources:
264.98	it can come from fossil fuels,
266.767	it can come from any way
266.767	that you can create electricity,
269.552	including renewables.
271.212	And it can come from biofuels.
273.027	And that's quite exciting.
274.569	The vision here is to have each local
274.569	community play to its natural strength
278.845	in creating the hydrogen.
280.168	A lot of hydrogen is produced
280.168	today in the world.
282.544	It's produced to get
282.544	sulfur out of gasoline --
284.852	which I find is somewhat ironic.
286.683	It's produced in the fertilizer industry;
289.314	it's produced in the chemical
289.314	manufacturing industry.
292.56	That hydrogen is being made
293.973	because there's a good
293.973	business reason for its use.
296.662	But it tells us that we know
296.662	how to create it,
299.25	we know how to create it cost-effectively,
301.547	we know how to handle it safely.
303.838	We did an analysis
305.059	where you would have
305.059	a station in each city
307.679	with each of the 100 largest cities
307.679	in the United States,
310.83	and located the stations
312.83	so you'd be no more than two miles
312.83	from a station at any time.
315.83	We put one every 25 miles on the freeway,
318.163	and it turns out that translates
318.163	into about 12,000 stations.
322.192	And at a million dollars each,
322.192	that would be about 12 billion dollars.
325.581	That's a lot of money.
326.83	But if you built the Alaskan
326.83	pipeline today,
328.949	that's half of what the Alaskan
328.949	pipeline would cost.
332.054	But the real exciting vision
332.054	that we see, truly, is home refueling,
336.078	much like recharging your laptop
336.078	or recharging your cell phone.
339.727	So we're pretty excited
339.727	about the future of hydrogen.
342.79	We think it's a question of not whether,
342.79	but a question of when.
346.83	What we've targeted for ourselves --
348.63	and we're making great progress
348.63	toward this goal --
351.179	is to have a propulsion system
351.179	based on hydrogen and fuel cells,
354.695	designed and validated,
356.441	that can go head-to-head
356.441	with the internal combustion engine.
359.41	We're talking about obsoleting
359.41	the internal combustion engine,
362.441	and doing it in terms
362.441	of affordability at scale volumes,
365.506	its performance and its durability.
367.929	So that's what we're driving to for 2010.
370.644	We haven't seen anything yet
370.644	in our development work
373.146	that says that isn't possible.
374.646	We actually think the future
374.646	is going to be event-driven.
377.79	So since we can't predict the future,
379.791	we want to spend a lot of our time
379.791	trying to create that future.
382.83	I'm very, very intrigued
384.274	by the fact that our cars and trucks
384.274	sit idle 90 percent of the time:
388.829	they're parked all around us.
391.052	They're usually parked within 100 feet
391.052	of the people that own them.
394.427	Now, if you take the power-generating
394.427	capability of an automobile
398.23	and you compare that to the electric grid
398.23	in the United States,
401.483	it turns out that the power
401.483	in four percent of the automobiles
406.1	equals that of the electric
406.1	grid of the US.
408.687	That's a huge power-generating capability,
411.612	a mobile power-generating capability.
413.742	And hydrogen and fuel cells
413.742	give us that opportunity
416.743	to actually use our cars and trucks
416.743	when they're parked
419.545	to generate electricity for the grid.
421.546	We talked about swarm networks earlier.
423.695	Talk about the ultimate swarm --
423.695	having all of the processors
427.096	and all of the cars
427.096	when they're sitting idle
429.264	being part of a global grid
429.264	for computing capability.
432.79	We find that premise quite exciting.
435.475	The automobile becomes,
435.475	then, an appliance --
437.737	not in a commodity sense,
439.037	but an appliance, mobile power,
439.037	mobile platform
441.83	for information and computing
441.83	and communication,
444.469	as well as a form of transportation.
446.83	And the key to all of this
446.83	is to make it affordable,
449.481	to make it exciting,
450.656	to get it on a pathway where
450.656	there's a way to make money doing it.
453.821	And again, this is a pretty
453.821	big march to take here.
456.83	A lot of people say:
458.007	How do you sleep at night
459.225	when you're wrestling with a problem
459.225	of that magnitude?
461.868	I tell them I sleep like a baby:
461.868	I wake up crying every two hours.
465.056	(Laughter)
466.223	Actually, the theme
466.223	of this conference, I think,
468.545	has hit on one of the major keys
468.545	to pull that off,
470.943	and that's relationships
470.943	and working together.
473.157	Thank you very much.
474.351	(Applause)
477.686	Chris Anderson: Larry, Larry -- wait,
477.686	wait, wait. Larry, wait one sec.
483.292	I've got so many questions
483.292	I could ask you.
485.698	I just want to ask one.
487.659	You know, I could be wrong about this,
489.537	but my sense is that
489.537	in the public mind today,
493.185	GM is not viewed as as serious
493.185	about some of these environmental ideas
499.61	as some of your Japanese
499.61	competitors, maybe even as Ford.
504.128	Are you serious about it,
505.549	and not just, you know,
505.549	when the consumers want it,
509.83	when the regulators force us
509.83	to do it, we will go there?
512.494	Will you guys really try
512.494	and show leadership on this?
515.02	Larry Burns: Absolutely.
515.02	We're absolutely serious.
517.432	We're into this
517.432	over a billion dollars already,
519.713	so I would hope people
519.713	would think we're serious
522.024	when we're spending that kind of money.
524.033	And secondly, it's a fundamental
524.033	business proposition.
527.065	I'll be honest with you;
528.245	we're into it for business
528.245	growth opportunities.
530.57	We can't grow our business
530.57	unless we solve these problems.
533.334	The growth of the auto industry
533.334	will be capped by sustainability issues
536.738	if we don't solve the problems.
538.26	And there's a simple principle
538.26	of strategy that says:
540.78	Do unto yourself
540.78	before others do unto you.
542.853	If we can see this possible
542.853	future, others can, too.
545.782	And we want to be the first one
545.782	to create it, Chris.
