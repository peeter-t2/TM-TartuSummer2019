12.76	Chris Anderson: Perhaps we could start
12.76	by just telling us about your country.
16.44	It's three dots there on the globe.
16.44	Those dots are pretty huge.
20.32	I think each one
20.32	is about the size of California.
23	Tell us about Kiribati.
24.88	Anote Tong: Well, let me first begin
24.88	by saying how deeply grateful I am
29.4	for this opportunity to share my story
29.4	with people who do care.
33.56	I think I've been sharing my story with
33.56	a lot of people who don't care too much.
39.16	But Kiribati is comprised
39.16	of three groups of islands:
43.04	the Gilbert Group on the west,
45.88	we have the Phoenix Islands in the middle,
49.24	and the Line Islands in the east.
53.68	And quite frankly, Kiribati
53.68	is perhaps the only country
56.8	that is actually
56.8	in the four corners of the world,
59.166	because we are in the Northern Hemisphere,
59.166	in the Southern Hemisphere,
62.49	and also in the east and the west
62.49	of the International Date Line.
65.57	These islands are entirely
65.57	made up of coral atolls,
71.92	and on average about
71.92	two meters above sea level.
76.879	And so this is what we have.
80.36	Usually not more
80.36	than two kilometers in width.
85.2	And so, on many occasions,
85.2	I've been asked by people,
88.16	"""You know, you're suffering,"
88.16	"why don't you move back?"""
90.72	They don't understand.
91.96	They have no concept
91.96	of what it is that's involved.
95.68	With the rising sea, they say,
95.68	"""Well, you can move back."""
99.28	And so this is what I tell them.
100.88	If we move back, we will fall off
100.88	on the other side of the ocean. OK?
105.24	But these are the kinds of issues
105.24	that people don't understand.
110.04	CA: So certainly this is
110.04	just a picture of fragility there.
114.28	When was it that you yourself realized
116.84	that there might be
116.84	impending peril for your country?
120.48	AT: Well, the story of climate change
120.48	has been one that has been going on
123.96	for quite a number of decades.
125.44	And when I came into office in 2003,
130.2	I began talking about climate change
130.2	at the United Nations General Assembly,
134.48	but not with so much passion,
137.24	because then there was still
137.24	this controversy among the scientists
140.88	whether it was human-induced,
140.88	whether it was real or it wasn't.
146.16	But I think that that debate
146.16	was fairly much concluded in 2007
152.32	with the Fourth Assessment
152.32	Report of the IPCC,
157.92	which made a categorical statement
157.92	that it is real, it's human-induced,
164.8	and it's predicting
164.8	some very serious scenarios
168.76	for countries like mine.
171.32	And so that's when I got very serious.
174.6	In the past, I talked about it.
178.6	We were worried.
179.84	But when the scenarios,
179.84	the predictions came in 2007,
183.6	it became a real issue for us.
185.96	CA: Now, those predictions are,
185.96	I think, that by 2100,
191.6	sea levels are forecast to rise
191.6	perhaps three feet.
194.4	There's scenarios where
194.4	it's higher than that, for sure,
197.044	but what would you say
197.044	to a skeptic who said,
199.204	"""What's three feet?"
200.4	You're on average
200.4	six feet above sea level.
202.6	"What's the problem?"""
204.2	AT: Well, I think
204.2	it's got to be understood
206.28	that a marginal rise in sea level
208.36	would mean a loss of a lot of land,
210.96	because much of the land is low.
214.24	And quite apart from that,
214.24	we are getting the swells at the moment.
219.36	So it's not about getting two feet.
221.56	I think what many people do not understand
224.6	is they think climate change is something
224.6	that is happening in the future.
230.8	Well, we're at the very
230.8	bottom end of the spectrum.
233.64	It's already with us.
234.92	We have communities
234.92	who already have been dislocated.
238.76	They have had to move,
238.76	and every parliament session,
242.72	I'm getting complaints
242.72	from different communities
245.08	asking for assistance to build seawalls,
248.16	to see what we can do
248.16	about the freshwater lens
250.72	because it's being destroyed,
252.56	and so in my trips
252.56	to the different islands,
255.32	I'm seeing evidence of communities
258.04	which are now having to cope
258.04	with the loss of food crops,
261.68	the contamination of the water lenses,
265.28	and I see these communities
265.28	perhaps leaving, having to relocate,
269.64	within five to 10 years.
272	CA: And then, I think the country
272	suffered its first cyclone,
275.96	and this is connected, yes?
275.96	What happened here?
279.52	AT: Well, we're on the equator,
282.24	and I'm sure many of you understand
282.24	that when you're on the equator,
286.68	it's supposed to be in the doldrums.
286.68	We're not supposed to get the cyclones.
290.28	We create them, and then we send them
290.28	either north or south.
293.114	(Laughter)
294.52	But they aren't supposed to come back.
296.4	But for the first time,
296.4	at the beginning of this year,
298.948	the Cyclone Pam,
298.948	which destroyed Vanuatu,
302.64	and in the process,
302.64	the very edges of it actually touched
306.12	our two southernmost islands,
308.52	and all of Tuvalu was underwater
308.52	when Hurricane Pam struck.
313.92	But for our two southernmost islands,
317.64	we had waves come over half the island,
321	and so this has never happened before.
323.48	It's a new experience.
325.08	And I've just come back
325.08	from my own constituency,
330.44	and I've seen these beautiful trees
330.44	which had been there for decades,
333.8	they've been totally destroyed.
335.8	So this is what's happening,
337.52	but when we talk
337.52	about the rising sea level,
341.4	we think it's something
341.4	that happens gradually.
344.52	It comes with the winds,
344.52	it comes with the swells,
347.6	and so they can be magnified,
349.56	but what we are beginning to witness
349.56	is the change in the weather pattern,
355.76	which is perhaps the more urgent challenge
358.52	that we will face sooner
358.52	than perhaps the rising sea level.
363.08	CA: So the country
363.08	is already seeing effects now.
366.36	As you look forward,
368.56	what are your options
368.56	as a country, as a nation?
372.52	AT: Well, I've been telling
372.52	this story every year.
375.2	I think I visit a number of --
376.653	I've been traveling the world
376.653	to try and get people to understand.
381.64	We have a plan, we think we have a plan.
384.12	And on one occasion,
384.12	I think I spoke in Geneva
387.56	and there was a gentleman
387.56	who was interviewing me
391.76	on something like this,
393.52	"and I said, ""We are looking"
393.52	"at floating islands,"""
395.88	and he thought it was funny,
395.88	but somebody said,
398.12	"""No, this is not funny."
398.12	"These people are looking for solutions."""
402.08	And so I have been looking
402.08	at floating islands.
405.64	The Japanese are interested
405.64	in building floating islands.
409.4	But, as a country,
409.4	we have made a commitment
412.36	that no matter what happens,
412.36	we will try as much as possible
416.08	to stay and continue to exist as a nation.
420.28	What that will take,
421.84	it's going to be
421.84	something quite significant,
425.28	very, very substantial.
427.32	Either we live on floating islands,
429.12	or we have to build up the islands
429.12	to continue to stay out of the water
433.12	as the sea level rises
433.12	and as the storms get more severe.
437.88	But even that, it's going to be
437.88	very, very difficult
440.333	to get the kind of resourcing
440.333	that we would need.
443.2	CA: And then the only recourse
443.2	is some form of forced migration.
447.08	AT: Well, we are also looking at that
449.32	because in the event
449.32	that nothing comes forward
452.24	from the international community,
454.08	we are preparing,
455.36	we don't want to be caught
455.36	like what's happening in Europe.
458.6	OK? We don't want to mass migrate
458.6	at some point in time.
461.32	We want to be able
461.32	to give the people the choice today,
464.76	those who choose
464.76	and want to do that, to migrate.
468.44	We don't want something to happen
468.44	that they are forced to migrate
473.52	without having been prepared to do so.
475.84	Of course, our culture is very different,
475.84	our society is very different,
479.36	and once we migrate
479.36	into a different environment,
481.72	a different culture,
482.96	there's a whole lot
482.96	of adjustments that are required.
485.92	CA: Well, there's forced migration
485.92	in your country's past,
489.2	and I think just this week,
490.88	just yesterday
490.88	or the day before yesterday,
494.16	you visited these people.
496.36	What happened here? What's the story here?
498.56	AT: Yes, and I'm sorry,
498.56	I think somebody was asking
501	why we were sneaking off
501	to visit that place.
504	I had a very good reason, because we have
504	a community of Kiribati people
508	living in that part
508	of the Solomon Islands,
512.12	but these were people who were relocated
512.12	from the Phoenix Islands, in fact,
516	in the 1960s.
517.48	There was serious drought, and the people
517.48	could not continue to live on the island,
522.04	and so they were moved
522.04	to live here in the Solomon Islands.
525.44	And so yesterday it was very interesting
525.44	to meet with these people.
528.64	They didn't know who I was.
528.64	They hadn't heard of me.
531.12	Some of them later recognized me,
533.72	but I think they were very happy.
537.32	Later they really wanted to have
537.32	the opportunity to welcome me formally.
541.76	But I think what I saw yesterday
541.76	was very interesting
545.04	because here I see our people.
546.88	I spoke in our language, and of course
546.88	they spoke back, they replied,
552.72	but their accent, they are beginning
552.72	not to be able to speak Kiribati properly.
557.44	I saw them, there was
557.44	this lady with red teeth.
559.96	She was chewing betel nuts,
562.2	and it's not something we do in Kiribati.
564.48	We don't chew betel nuts.
567.12	I met also a family who have married
567.12	the local people here,
573	and so this is what is happening.
577.12	As you go into another community,
577.12	there are bound to be changes.
580.72	There is bound to be
580.72	a certain loss of identity,
585.2	and this is what we will be
585.2	looking for in the future
588.68	if and when we do migrate.
590.96	CA: It must have been
590.96	just an extraordinarily emotional day
594.16	because of these questions about identity,
597	the joy of seeing you and perhaps
597	an emphasized sense of what they had lost.
602.24	And it's very inspiring to hear you say
602.24	you're going to fight to the end
605.645	to try to preserve
605.645	the nation in a location.
610.08	AT: This is our wish.
611.4	Nobody wants ever to leave their home,
614.48	and so it's been
614.48	a very difficult decision for me.
617.56	As a leader, you don't make plans
617.56	to leave your island, your home,
622.96	and so I've been asked
622.96	on a number of occasions,
625.24	"""So how do you feel?"""
626.48	And it doesn't feel good at all.
629.64	It's an emotional thing,
629.64	and I've tried to live with it,
633.24	and I know that on occasions, I'm accused
633.24	of not trying to solve the problem
638.2	because I can't solve the problem.
640.2	It's something that's got
640.2	to be done collectively.
643.04	Climate change is a global phenomenon,
643.04	and as I've often argued,
648.84	unfortunately, the countries,
648.84	when we come to the United Nations --
653.36	I was in a meeting with
653.36	the Pacific Island Forum countries
658.28	where Australia and New Zealand
658.28	are also members,
660.8	and we had an argument.
662.56	There was a bit of a story in the news
665.28	because they were arguing
665.28	that to cut emissions,
669.6	it would be something
669.6	that they're unable to do
671.88	because it would affect the industries.
675.12	And so here I was saying,
676.6	OK, I hear you,
678.84	I understand what you're saying,
680.52	but try also to understand what I'm saying
682.8	because if you do not cut your emissions,
685.44	then our survival is on the line.
687.84	And so it's a matter for you
687.84	to weigh this, these moral issues.
692.2	It's about industry as opposed to
692.2	the survival of a people.
696.24	CA: You know, I ask you yesterday
696.24	what made you angry,
698.92	"and you said, ""I don't get angry."""
698.92	But then you paused.
702.44	I think this made you angry.
704.08	AT: I'd refer you to my earlier
704.08	statement at the United Nations.
709	I was very angry, very frustrated
709	and then depressed.
713.96	There was a sense of futility
715.96	that we are fighting a fight
715.96	that we have no hope of winning.
721.44	I had to change my approach.
723.64	I had to become more reasonable
725.76	because I thought people would listen
725.76	to somebody who was rational,
728.927	but I remain radically rational,
728.927	whatever that is.
731.52	(Laughter)
733.16	CA: Now, a core part
733.16	of your nation's identity is fishing.
736.92	I think you said pretty much everyone
736.92	is involved in fishing in some way.
740.44	AT: Well, we eat fish
740.44	every day, every day,
743.24	and I think there is no doubt
743.24	that our rate of consumption of fish
747.8	is perhaps the highest in the world.
749.96	We don't have a lot of livestock,
752.44	so it's fish that we depend on.
755.24	CA: So you're dependent on fish,
755.24	both at the local level
758.4	and for the revenues
758.4	that the country receives
761.12	from the global fishing business for tuna,
763.72	and yet despite that, a few years ago
763.72	you took a very radical step.
768.64	Can you tell us about that?
770.04	I think something happened
770.04	right here in the Phoenix Islands.
773.4	AT: Let me give some of the background
773.4	of what fish means for us.
778.72	We have one of the largest
778.72	tuna fisheries remaining in the world.
782.68	In the Pacific, I think we own
782.68	something like 60 percent
785.56	of the remaining tuna fisheries,
787.48	and it remains relatively healthy
787.48	for some species, but not all.
791.76	And Kiribati is one of the three
791.76	major resource owners,
797.92	tuna resource owners.
799.64	And at the moment, we have been getting
803.24	something like 80 to 90
803.24	percent of our revenue
806.16	from access fees, license fees.
808.64	CA: Of your national revenue.
810.52	AT: National revenue,
812.36	which drives everything that we do
815.2	in governments, hospitals,
815.2	schools and what have you.
819.24	But we decided to close this,
819.24	and it was a very difficult decision.
824.48	I can assure you, politically,
824.48	locally, it was not easy,
830.04	but I was convinced that we had to do this
834	in order to ensure
834	that the fishery remains sustainable.
838.6	There had been some indications
838.6	that some of the species,
841.4	in particular the bigeye,
841.4	was under serious threat.
845.56	The yellowfin was also heavily fished.
848.96	Skipjack remains healthy.
850.72	And so we had to do something like that,
850.72	and so that was the reason I did that.
855.52	Another reason why I did that
859.44	was because I had been asking
859.44	the international community
864.16	that in order to deal with climate change,
864.16	in order to fight climate change,
868.72	there has got to be sacrifice,
868.72	there has got to be commitment.
872.64	So in asking the international community
872.64	to make a sacrifice,
877.96	I thought we ourselves
877.96	need to make that sacrifice.
880.8	And so we made the sacrifice.
882.64	And forgoing commercial fishing
887.608	in the Phoenix Islands protected area
890.24	would mean a loss of revenue.
892.12	We are still trying to assess
892.12	what that loss would be
894.621	because we actually closed it off
894.621	at the beginning of this year,
899.88	and so we will see by the end of this year
902.24	what it means in terms
902.24	of the lost revenue.
905.76	CA: So there's so many things
905.76	playing into this.
908.04	On the one hand,
908.04	it may prompt healthier fisheries.
915.04	I mean, how much are you able
915.04	to move the price up
917.44	that you charge for the remaining areas?
919.96	AT: The negotiations
919.96	have been very difficult,
924.6	but we have managed
924.6	to raise the cost of a vessel day.
928.48	For any vessel
928.48	to come in to fish for a day,
931.12	we have raised the fee from --
931.12	it was $6,000 and $8,000,
934.76	now to $10,000, $12,000 per vessel day.
939.36	And so there's been
939.36	that significant increase.
942.6	But at the same time,
942.6	what's important to note is,
947.2	whereas in the past these fishing boats
951.56	might be fishing in a day
951.56	and maybe catch 10 tons,
955.52	now they're catching maybe 100 tons
955.52	because they've become so efficient.
959.44	And so we've got to respond likewise.
961.8	We've got to be very, very careful
961.8	because the technology has so improved.
966	There was a time when the Brazilian fleet
966	moved from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
971.44	They couldn't.
972.68	They started experimenting
972.68	if they could, per se.
975.92	But now they've got ways of doing it,
975.92	and they've become so efficient.
981	CA: Can you give us a sense
981	of what it's like in those negotiations?
984.223	Because you're up against companies
985.944	that have hundreds of millions
985.944	of dollars at stake, essentially.
989.56	How do you hold the line?
992.92	Is there any advice you can give
995	to other leaders who are dealing
995	with the same companies
998.08	about how to get
998.08	the most for your country,
1002.4	get the most for the fish?
1006.44	What advice would you give?
1008	AT: Well, I think we focus
1008	too often on licensing
1014.28	in order to get the rate of return,
1015.971	because what we are getting
1015.971	from license fees
1018.8	is about 10 percent
1018.8	of the landed value of the catch
1021.44	on the side of the wharf,
1021.44	not in the retail shops.
1024.6	And we only get about 10 percent.
1028.6	What we have been trying
1028.6	to do over the years
1031.24	is actually to increase
1031.24	our participation in the industry,
1035.12	in the harvesting, in the processing,
1037.76	and eventually, hopefully, the marketing.
1039.642	They're not easy to penetrate,
1043.359	but we are working towards that,
1045.68	and yes, the answer would be to enhance.
1048.319	In order to increase our rate of return,
1048.319	we have to become more involved.
1052.56	And so we've started doing that,
1055.76	and we have to restructure the industry.
1060.04	We've got to tell these people
1060.04	that the world has changed.
1063.44	Now we want to produce the fish ourselves.
1065.88	CA: And meanwhile,
1065.88	for your local fishermen,
1068	they are still able to fish,
1071.12	but what is business like for them?
1073.6	Is it getting harder?
1073.6	Are the waters depleted?
1075.96	Or is that being run
1075.96	on a sustainable basis?
1079.44	AT: For the artisanal fishery,
1080.92	we do not participate
1080.92	in the commercial fishing activity
1084.2	except only to supply the domestic market.
1087.24	The tuna fishery is really
1087.24	entirely for the foreign market,
1090.56	mostly here in the US, Europe, Japan.
1096.8	So I am a fisherman, very much,
1101.36	and I used to be able to catch yellowfin.
1104.56	Now it's very, very rare
1104.56	to be able to catch yellowfin
1107.36	because they are being lifted
1107.36	out of the water by the hundreds of tons
1110.76	by these purse seiners.
1114.36	CA: So here's a couple
1114.36	of beautiful girls from your country.
1119.32	I mean, as you think about their future,
1122.56	what message would you have for them
1125.24	and what message
1125.24	would you have for the world?
1128.28	AT: Well, I've been telling the world
1128.28	that we really have to do something
1131.733	about what is happening to the climate
1133.6	because for us, it's about
1133.6	the future of these children.
1136.4	I have 12 grandchildren, at least.
1138.36	I think I have 12, my wife knows.
1140.4	(Laughter)
1142.64	And I think I have eight children.
1145.68	It's about their future.
1146.96	Every day I see my grandchildren,
1146.96	about the same age as these young girls,
1150.72	and I do wonder,
1153.16	and I get angry sometimes, yes I do.
1155.4	I wonder what is to become of them.
1157.48	And so it's about them
1160.64	that we should be telling everybody,
1162.92	that it's not about
1162.92	their own national interest,
1165.2	because climate change,
1165.2	regrettably, unfortunately,
1168.88	is viewed by many countries
1168.88	as a national problem. It's not.
1173	And this is the argument
1173	we got into recently with our partners,
1176.024	the Australians and New Zealanders,
1177.744	because they said,
1177.744	"""We can't cut any more."""
1181.08	This is what one of the leaders,
1181.08	the Australian leader, said,
1184.72	that we've done our part,
1184.72	we are cutting back.
1189	I said, What about the rest?
1189	Why don't you keep it?
1192.68	If you could keep
1192.68	the rest of your emissions
1195.4	within your boundaries,
1195.4	within your borders,
1197.72	we'd have no question.
1199.52	You can go ahead as much as you like.
1201.36	But unfortunately,
1201.36	you're sending it our way,
1203.52	and it's affecting
1203.52	the future of our children.
1205.735	And so surely I think that is the heart
1205.735	of the problem of climate change today.
1210.8	We will be meeting in Paris
1210.8	at the end of this year,
1213.88	but until we can think of this
1213.88	as a global phenomenon,
1217.84	because we create it,
1217.84	individually, as nations,
1221.12	but it affects everybody else,
1223.08	and yet, we refuse
1223.08	to do anything about it,
1226.72	and we deal with it as a national problem,
1229.2	which it is not -- it is a global issue,
1231.32	and it's got to be
1231.32	dealt with collectively.
1235.12	CA: People are incredibly bad
1235.12	at responding to graphs and numbers,
1239.48	and we shut our minds to it.
1243.28	Somehow, to people, we're slightly better
1243.28	at responding to that sometimes.
1249.56	And it seems like it's
1249.56	very possible that your nation,
1252.52	despite, actually because of
1252.52	the intense problems you face,
1257	you may yet be the warning light
1257	to the world that shines most visibly,
1261.92	most powerfully.
1263.92	I just want to thank you, 
1263.92	I'm sure, on behalf of all of us,
1266.762	for your extraordinary leadership
1266.762	and for being here.
1269.28	Mr. President, thank you so much.
1270.873	AT: Thank you.
1271.666	(Applause)
