15.26	The story I wanted to share with you today
17.26	is my challenge as an Iranian artist,
21.26	as an Iranian woman artist,
23.26	as an Iranian woman artist
25.26	living in exile.
28.26	Well, it has its pluses and minuses.
31.26	On the dark side,
33.26	politics doesn't seem to escape people like me.
36.26	Every Iranian artist, in one form or another,
39.26	is political.
41.26	Politics have defined our lives.
44.26	If you're living in Iran,
46.26	you're facing censorship, harassment,
49.26	arrest, torture --
51.26	at times, execution.
54.26	If you're living outside like me,
56.26	you're faced with life in exile --
58.26	the pain of the longing
60.26	and the separation from your loved ones
62.26	and your family.
64.26	Therefore, we don't find
66.26	the moral, emotional,
68.26	psychological and political space
70.26	to distance ourselves from the reality
73.26	of social responsibility.
76.26	Oddly enough,
78.26	an artist such as myself
80.26	finds herself also in the position of being the voice,
84.26	the speaker of my people,
87.26	even if I have, indeed,
89.26	no access to my own country.
92.26	Also, people like myself,
95.26	we're fighting two battles on different grounds.
98.26	We're being critical of the West,
100.26	the perception of the West
102.26	about our identity --
104.26	about the image that is constructed about us,
107.26	about our women, about our politics,
110.26	about our religion.
112.26	We are there to take pride
114.26	and insist on respect.
116.26	And at the same time,
118.26	we're fighting another battle.
120.26	That is our regime,
122.26	our government --
124.26	our atrocious government,
126.26	[that] has done every crime
128.26	in order to stay in power.
131.26	Our artists are at risk.
134.26	We are in a position of danger.
137.26	We pose a threat
139.26	to the order of the government.
141.26	But ironically,
143.26	this situation
145.26	has empowered all of us,
147.26	because we are considered, as artists,
149.26	central to the cultural, political,
152.26	social discourse in Iran.
154.26	We are there to inspire, to provoke,
157.26	to mobilize,
159.26	to bring hope to our people.
161.26	We are the reporters of our people,
164.26	and are communicators
166.26	to the outside world.
168.26	Art is our weapon.
171.26	Culture is a form of resistance.
174.26	I envy sometimes the artists of the West
177.26	for their freedom of expression.
179.26	For the fact that they can distance themselves
182.26	from the question of politics.
184.26	From the fact that they are only serving one audience,
186.26	mainly the Western culture.
189.26	But also, I worry about the West,
193.26	because often in this country,
195.26	in this Western world that we have,
198.26	culture risks being a form of entertainment.
203.26	Our people depend on our artists,
206.26	and culture is beyond communication.
210.26	My journey as an artist
212.26	started from a very, very personal place.
215.26	I did not start
217.26	to make social commentary
219.26	about my country.
221.26	The first one that you see in front of you
224.26	is actually when I first returned to Iran
226.26	after being separated for a good 12 years.
229.26	It was after the Islamic Revolution
231.26	of 1979.
234.26	While I was absent from Iran,
237.26	the Islamic Revolution had descended on Iran
240.26	and had entirely transformed the country
242.26	from Persian to the Islamic culture.
245.26	I came mainly to be reunited with my family
248.26	and to reconnect in a way
250.26	that I found my place in the society.
252.26	But instead, I found a country
254.26	that was totally ideological
256.26	and that I didn't recognize anymore.
259.26	More so, I became very interested,
261.26	as I was facing
263.26	my own personal dilemmas and questions,
265.26	I became immersed in the study
267.26	of the Islamic Revolution --
269.26	how, indeed,
271.26	it had incredibly transformed
273.26	the lives of Iranian women.
275.26	I found the subject of Iranian women
277.26	immensely interesting,
279.26	in the way the women of Iran, historically,
282.26	seemed to embody the political transformation.
285.26	So in a way, by studying a woman,
288.26	you can read the structure and the ideology of the country.
292.26	So I made a group of work
294.26	that at once faced my own personal questions in life,
298.26	and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse --
301.26	the subject of martyrdom,
303.26	the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection
307.26	of love of God, faith,
311.26	but violence and crime and cruelty.
314.26	For me, this became incredibly important.
317.26	And yet, I had an unusual position toward this.
320.26	I was an outsider
322.26	who had come back to Iran to find my place,
325.26	but I was not in a position
327.26	to be critical of the government
330.26	or the ideology of the Islamic Revolution.
333.26	This changed slowly
335.26	as I found my voice
337.26	and I discovered things
339.26	that I didn't know I would discover.
341.26	So my art became slightly more critical.
344.26	My knife became a little sharper.
346.26	And I fell into a life in exile.
350.26	I am a nomadic artist.
352.26	I work in Morocco, in Turkey, in Mexico.
355.26	I go everywhere to make believe it's Iran.
358.26	Now I am making films.
360.26	Last year, I finished a film
362.26	"called ""Women Without Men."""
364.26	"""Women Without Men"" returns to history,"
366.26	but another part of our Iranian history.
369.26	It goes to 1953
371.26	when American CIA exercised a coup
374.26	and removed a democratically elected leader,
376.26	Dr. Mossadegh.
378.26	The book is written by an Iranian woman,
380.26	Shahrnush Parsipur.
382.26	It's a magical realist novel.
384.26	This book is banned,
386.26	and she spent five years in prison.
388.26	My obsession with this book,
390.26	and the reason I made this into a film,
392.26	is because it at once was addressing
394.26	the question of being a female --
396.26	traditionally, historically in Iran --
399.26	and the question of four women
401.26	who are all looking for an idea
403.26	of change, freedom and democracy --
406.26	while the country of Iran, equally, as if another character,
409.26	also struggled for an idea
411.26	of freedom and democracy
413.26	and independence from the foreign interventions.
416.26	I made this film
418.26	because I felt it's important
420.26	for it to speak to the Westerners
422.26	about our history as a country.
425.26	That all of you seem to remember Iran
427.26	after the Islamic Revolution.
429.26	That Iran was once a secular society,
432.26	and we had democracy,
434.26	and this democracy was stolen from us
436.26	by the American government,
438.26	by the British government.
440.26	This film also speaks to the Iranian people
443.26	in asking them to return to their history
445.26	and look at themselves before they were so Islamicized --
449.26	in the way we looked, in the way we played music,
452.26	in the way we had intellectual life.
456.26	And most of all,
458.26	in the way that we fought for democracy.
461.26	These are some of the shots actually from my film.
464.26	These are some of the images of the coup.
466.26	And we made this film in Casablanca,
469.26	recreating all the shots.
471.26	This film tried to find a balance
474.26	between telling a political story,
476.26	but also a feminine story.
478.26	Being a visual artist, indeed,
480.26	I am foremost interested to make art --
483.26	to make art that transcends
485.26	politics, religion,
487.26	the question of feminism,
490.26	and become an important, timeless,
492.26	universal work of art.
494.26	The challenge I have
496.26	is how to do that.
498.26	How to tell a political story but an allegorical story.
501.26	How to move you with your emotions,
503.26	but also make your mind work.
505.26	These are some of the images
507.26	and the characters of the film.
520.26	Now comes the green movement --
522.26	the summer of 2009,
524.26	as my film is released --
526.26	the uprising begins in the streets of Tehran.
529.26	What is unbelievably ironic
532.26	is the period that we tried to depict in the film,
535.26	the cry for democracy
537.26	and social justice,
539.26	repeats itself now
541.26	again in Tehran.
543.26	The green movement
545.26	significantly inspired the world.
547.26	It brought a lot of attention to all those Iranians
550.26	who stand for basic human rights
552.26	and struggle for democracy.
554.26	What was most significant for me
556.26	was, once again,
558.26	the presence of the women.
560.26	They're absolutely inspirational for me.
562.26	If in the Islamic Revolution,
564.26	the images of the woman portrayed
566.26	were submissive
568.26	and didn't have a voice,
570.26	now we saw a new idea of feminism
572.26	in the streets of Tehran --
575.26	women who were educated,
577.26	forward thinking, non-traditional,
579.26	sexually open, fearless
582.26	and seriously feminist.
585.26	These women and those young men
588.26	united Iranians
590.26	across the world, inside and outside.
593.26	I then discovered
595.26	why I take so much inspiration
597.26	from Iranian women.
599.26	That, under all circumstances,
601.26	they have pushed the boundary.
603.26	They have confronted the authority.
605.26	They have broken every rule
607.26	in the smallest and the biggest way.
609.26	And once again, they proved themselves.
611.26	I stand here to say
613.26	that Iranian women have found a new voice,
616.26	and their voice is giving me my voice.
619.26	And it's a great honor
621.26	to be an Iranian woman and an Iranian artist,
624.26	even if I have to operate in the West only for now.
628.26	Thank you so much.
630.26	(Applause)
