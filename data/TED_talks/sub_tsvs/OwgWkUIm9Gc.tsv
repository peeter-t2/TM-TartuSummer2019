15.679	One day in 1819,
18.025	3,000 miles off the coast of Chile,
20.784	in one of the most remote regions of the Pacific Ocean,
27.754	They'd been struck by a sperm whale, which had ripped
29.934	a catastrophic hole in the ship's hull.
32.835	As their ship began to sink beneath the swells,
35.164	the men huddled together in three small whaleboats.
39.477	These men were 10,000 miles from home,
41.74	more than 1,000 miles from the nearest scrap of land.
44.963	In their small boats, they carried only
47.167	rudimentary navigational equipment
48.733	and limited supplies of food and water.
52.381	These were the men of the whaleship Essex,
54.585	"whose story would later inspire parts of ""Moby Dick."""
57.24	Even in today's world, their situation would be really dire,
60.189	but think about how much worse it would have been then.
62.115	No one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong.
65.34	No search party was coming to look for these men.
68.252	So most of us have never experienced a situation
71.114	as frightening as the one in which these sailors found themselves,
74.617	but we all know what it's like to be afraid.
76.484	We know how fear feels,
78.778	but I'm not sure we spend enough time thinking about
80.882	what our fears mean.
82.527	As we grow up, we're often encouraged to think of fear
85.364	as a weakness, just another childish thing to discard
88.277	like baby teeth or roller skates.
91.095	And I think it's no accident that we think this way.
93.59	Neuroscientists have actually shown that human beings
96.197	are hard-wired to be optimists.
98.936	So maybe that's why we think of fear, sometimes,
101.719	as a danger in and of itself.
103.697	"""Don't worry,"" we like to say to one another. ""Don't panic."""
106.694	In English, fear is something we conquer.
109.343	It's something we fight. It's something we overcome.
113.176	But what if we looked at fear in a fresh way?
115.381	What if we thought of fear as an amazing act of the imagination,
119.524	something that can be as profound and insightful
121.902	as storytelling itself?
124.556	It's easiest to see this link between fear and the imagination
127.149	in young children, whose fears are often extraordinarily vivid.
130.428	When I was a child, I lived in California,
132.709	which is, you know, mostly a very nice place to live,
135.398	but for me as a child, California could also be a little scary.
139.406	I remember how frightening it was to see the chandelier
142.447	that hung above our dining table swing back and forth
144.88	during every minor earthquake,
147.055	and I sometimes couldn't sleep at night, terrified
149.358	that the Big One might strike while we were sleeping.
151.879	And what we say about kids who have fears like that
154.751	is that they have a vivid imagination.
157.979	But at a certain point, most of us learn
160.369	to leave these kinds of visions behind and grow up.
163.255	We learn that there are no monsters hiding under the bed,
166.012	and not every earthquake brings buildings down.
168.992	But maybe it's no coincidence that some of our most creative minds
172.4	fail to leave these kinds of fears behind as adults.
175.511	"The same incredible imaginations that produced ""The Origin of Species,"""
179.372	"""Jane Eyre"" and ""The Remembrance of Things Past,"""
182.229	also generated intense worries that haunted the adult lives
185.568	of Charles Darwin, Charlotte BrontĂŤ and Marcel Proust.
190.024	So the question is, what can the rest of us learn about fear
192.953	from visionaries and young children?
196.257	Well let's return to the year 1819 for a moment,
199.117	to the situation facing the crew of the whaleship Essex.
202.804	Let's take a look at the fears that their imaginations
204.923	were generating as they drifted in the middle of the Pacific.
208.679	Twenty-four hours had now passed since the capsizing of the ship.
212.228	The time had come for the men to make a plan,
214.931	but they had very few options.
217.657	In his fascinating account of the disaster,
220.088	Nathaniel Philbrick wrote that these men were just about
222.828	as far from land as it was possible to be anywhere on Earth.
227.228	The men knew that the nearest islands they could reach
229.528	were the Marquesas Islands, 1,200 miles away.
233.304	But they'd heard some frightening rumors.
235.826	They'd been told that these islands,
237.504	and several others nearby, were populated by cannibals.
241.748	So the men pictured coming ashore only to be murdered
244.124	and eaten for dinner.
245.765	Another possible destination was Hawaii,
248.517	but given the season, the captain was afraid
250.389	they'd be struck by severe storms.
253.61	Now the last option was the longest, and the most difficult:
257.402	to sail 1,500 miles due south in hopes of reaching
261.026	a certain band of winds that could eventually
262.915	push them toward the coast of South America.
265.179	But they knew that the sheer length of this journey
267.9	would stretch their supplies of food and water.
271.411	To be eaten by cannibals, to be battered by storms,
274.817	to starve to death before reaching land.
278.178	These were the fears that danced in the imaginations of these poor men,
281.57	and as it turned out, the fear they chose to listen to
284.469	would govern whether they lived or died.
287.123	Now we might just as easily call these fears by a different name.
291.333	What if instead of calling them fears,
293.611	we called them stories?
295.222	Because that's really what fear is, if you think about it.
297.455	It's a kind of unintentional storytelling
300.515	that we are all born knowing how to do.
303.445	And fears and storytelling have the same components.
306.208	They have the same architecture.
308.073	Like all stories, fears have characters.
310.75	In our fears, the characters are us.
313.173	Fears also have plots. They have beginnings and middles and ends.
317.475	You board the plane. The plane takes off. The engine fails.
321.591	Our fears also tend to contain imagery that can be
324.159	every bit as vivid as what you might find in the pages of a novel.
327.508	Picture a cannibal, human teeth
330.464	sinking into human skin,
332.671	human flesh roasting over a fire.
335.725	Fears also have suspense.
338.461	If I've done my job as a storyteller today,
340.751	you should be wondering what happened
342.259	to the men of the whaleship Essex.
344.36	Our fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense.
348.605	Just like all great stories, our fears focus our attention
352.158	on a question that is as important in life as it is in literature:
356.097	What will happen next?
358.854	In other words, our fears make us think about the future.
361.558	And humans, by the way, are the only creatures capable
363.576	of thinking about the future in this way,
365.246	of projecting ourselves forward in time,
368.137	and this mental time travel is just one more thing
370.549	that fears have in common with storytelling.
374.171	As a writer, I can tell you that a big part of writing fiction
376.664	is learning to predict how one event in a story
378.547	will affect all the other events,
380.291	and fear works in that same way.
382.34	In fear, just like in fiction, one thing always leads to another.
387.517	"When I was writing my first novel, ""The Age Of Miracles,"""
390.163	I spent months trying to figure out what would happen
393.124	if the rotation of the Earth suddenly began to slow down.
396.313	What would happen to our days? What would happen to our crops?
399.205	What would happen to our minds?
401.248	And then it was only later that I realized how very similar
404.354	these questions were to the ones I used to ask myself
406.475	as a child frightened in the night.
408.712	If an earthquake strikes tonight, I used to worry,
411.243	what will happen to our house? What will happen to my family?
415.109	And the answer to those questions always took the form of a story.
419.809	So if we think of our fears as more than just fears
422.312	but as stories, we should think of ourselves
425.239	as the authors of those stories.
427.47	But just as importantly, we need to think of ourselves
429.432	as the readers of our fears, and how we choose
431.936	to read our fears can have a profound effect on our lives.
436.271	Now, some of us naturally read our fears more closely than others.
439.272	I read about a study recently of successful entrepreneurs,
442.193	and the author found that these people shared a habit
444.819	"that he called ""productive paranoia,"" which meant that"
448.178	these people, instead of dismissing their fears,
450.699	these people read them closely, they studied them,
453.362	and then they translated that fear into preparation and action.
456.962	So that way, if their worst fears came true,
458.879	their businesses were ready.
460.957	And sometimes, of course, our worst fears do come true.
465.308	That's one of the things that is so extraordinary about fear.
468.467	Once in a while, our fears can predict the future.
473.389	But we can't possibly prepare for all of the fears
476.784	that our imaginations concoct.
479.182	So how can we tell the difference between
481.166	the fears worth listening to and all the others?
484.986	I think the end of the story of the whaleship Essex
487.463	offers an illuminating, if tragic, example.
491.746	After much deliberation, the men finally made a decision.
496.473	Terrified of cannibals, they decided to forgo the closest islands
500.346	and instead embarked on the longer
502.673	and much more difficult route to South America.
505.8	After more than two months at sea, the men ran out of food
509.27	as they knew they might,
510.349	and they were still quite far from land.
513.044	When the last of the survivors were finally picked up
515.931	by two passing ships, less than half of the men were left alive,
520.417	and some of them had resorted to their own form of cannibalism.
525.32	"Herman Melville, who used this story as research for ""Moby Dick,"""
528.683	wrote years later, and from dry land, quote,
532.563	"""All the sufferings of these miserable men of the Essex"
535.187	might in all human probability have been avoided
537.876	had they, immediately after leaving the wreck,
540.443	steered straight for Tahiti.
542.324	"But,"" as Melville put it, ""they dreaded cannibals."""
546.889	So the question is, why did these men dread cannibals
549.935	so much more than the extreme likelihood of starvation?
554.124	Why were they swayed by one story
555.991	so much more than the other?
558.63	Looked at from this angle,
560.152	theirs becomes a story about reading.
563.451	The novelist Vladimir Nabokov said that the best reader
566.107	has a combination of two very different temperaments,
568.906	the artistic and the scientific.
571.756	A good reader has an artist's passion,
574.26	a willingness to get caught up in the story,
576.683	but just as importantly, the readers also needs
578.794	the coolness of judgment of a scientist,
582.005	which acts to temper and complicate
583.496	the reader's intuitive reactions to the story.
586.894	As we've seen, the men of the Essex had no trouble with the artistic part.
590.099	They dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios.
593.739	The problem was that they listened to the wrong story.
597.728	Of all the narratives their fears wrote,
599.852	they responded only to the most lurid, the most vivid,
603.503	the one that was easiest for their imaginations to picture:
606.722	cannibals.
608.673	But perhaps if they'd been able to read their fears
610.954	more like a scientist, with more coolness of judgment,
614.435	they would have listened instead to the less violent
617.195	but the more likely tale, the story of starvation,
620.483	and headed for Tahiti, just as Melville's sad commentary suggests.
626.063	And maybe if we all tried to read our fears,
628.931	we too would be less often swayed
630.908	by the most salacious among them.
632.784	Maybe then we'd spend less time worrying about
634.452	serial killers and plane crashes,
636.64	and more time concerned with the subtler
638.506	and slower disasters we face:
640.56	the silent buildup of plaque in our arteries,
643.308	the gradual changes in our climate.
645.851	Just as the most nuanced stories in literature are often the richest,
649.5	so too might our subtlest fears be the truest.
653.948	Read in the right way, our fears are an amazing gift
656.845	of the imagination, a kind of everyday clairvoyance,
659.777	a way of glimpsing what might be the future
662.012	when there's still time to influence how that future will play out.
665.447	Properly read, our fears can offer us something as precious
668.843	as our favorite works of literature:
671	a little wisdom, a bit of insight
674.045	and a version of that most elusive thing --
676.619	the truth.
677.87	Thank you. (Applause)
