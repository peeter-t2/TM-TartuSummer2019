12	It's amazing, when you meet a head of state and you say,
14	"""What is your most precious natural resource?"" --"
18	they will not say children at first.
20	And then when you say children,
22	they will pretty quickly agree with you.
31	(Video): We're traveling today with
33	the Minister of Defense of Colombia,
36	head of the army and the head of the police,
38	and we're dropping off 650 laptops
41	today to children
43	who have no television, no telephone
45	and have been in a community
47	cut off from the rest of the world
49	for the past 40 years. 
52	The importance of delivering laptops to this region
55	is connecting kids who have otherwise been unconnected
58	because of the FARC,
60	the guerrillas that started off 40 years ago
63	as a political movement and then became a drug movement.
68	There are one billion children in the world,
70	and 50 percent of them don't have electricity
72	at home or at school.
75	And in some countries -- let me pick Afghanistan --
80	And I don't mean that they drop out of school
82	in the third or fourth grade -- they don't go.
84	So in the three years
86	since I talked at TED and showed a prototype,
89	it's gone from an idea
91	to a real laptop.
94	We have half a million laptops today
96	in the hands of children.
99	We have about a quarter of a million in transit
101	to those and other children,
104	and then there are another quarter of a million more
108	that are being ordered at this moment.
110	So, in rough numbers, there are a million laptops.
112	That's smaller than I predicted --
114	I predicted three to 10 million --
116	but is still a very large number.
118	In Colombia, we have about 3,000 laptops.
122	It's the Minister of Defense with whom we're working,
125	not the Minister of Education, because it is seen as
128	a strategic defense issue
130	in the sense of liberating these zones
135	that had been completely closed off,
137	in which the people who had been causing, if you will,
145	and assassinations lived.
147	And suddenly,
149	the kids have connected laptops.
151	They've leapfrogged.
153	The change is absolutely monumental,
157	because it's not just opening it up,
159	but it's opening it up to the rest of the world.
162	So yes, they're building roads, yes, they're putting in telephone,
164	yes, there will be television.
166	But the kids six to 12 years old
168	are surfing the Internet in Spanish and in local languages,
172	so the children grow up
174	with access to information,
176	with a window into the rest of the world.
179	Before, they were closed off.
181	Interestingly enough, in other countries,
183	it will be the Minister of Finance who sees it
185	as an engine of economic growth.
189	And that engine is going to see the results in 20 years.
193	It's not going to happen, you know, in one year,
196	but it's an important, deeply economic
199	and cultural change
201	that happens through children.
204	Thirty-one countries in total are involved,
206	and in the case of Uruguay,
209	half the children already have them,
211	and by the middle of 2009,
214	every single child in Uruguay will have a laptop --
217	a little green laptop.
219	Now what are some of the results?
221	Some of the results
223	that go across every single country
226	include teachers saying
228	they have never loved teaching so much,
231	and reading comprehension
233	measured by third parties -- not by us -- skyrockets.
237	Probably the most important thing we see
240	is children teaching parents.
243	They own the laptops. They take them home.
246	And so when I met with three children from the schools,
249	who had traveled all day to come to Bogota,
253	one of the three children brought her mother.
256	And the reason she brought her mother
258	is that this six-year-old child
261	had been teaching her mother
263	how to read and write.
265	Her mother had not gone to primary school.
268	And this is such an inversion,
270	and such a wonderful example
273	of children being the agents of change.
277	So now, in closing, people say,
279	now why laptops?
281	Laptops are a luxury; it's like giving them iPods. No.
284	The reason you want laptops
286	is that the word is education, not laptop.
290	This is an education project, not a laptop project.
293	They need to learn learning. And then, just think --
295	they can have, let's say, 100 books.
297	In a village, you have 100 laptops,
300	each with a different set of 100 books,
303	and so that village suddenly has 10,000 books.
306	You and I didn't have 10,000 books when we went to primary school.
310	Sometimes school is under a tree,
312	or in many cases, the teacher has only a fifth-grade education,
316	so you need a collaborative model of learning,
319	not just building more schools and training more teachers,
321	which you have to do anyway.
323	"So we're once again doing ""Give One, Get One."""
326	"Last year, we ran a ""Give One, Get One"" program,"
328	and it generated over 100,000 laptops
332	that we were then able to give free.
335	And by being a zero-dollar laptop,
337	we can go to countries that can't afford it at all.
340	And that's what we did. We went to Haiti,
343	we went to Rwanda, Afghanistan,
345	Ethiopia, Mongolia.
348	Places that are not markets,
350	seeding it with the principles of
353	saturation, connectivity, low ages, etc.
356	And then we can actually roll out large numbers.
360	So think of it this way:
362	think of it as inoculating children
365	against ignorance.
368	And think of the laptop as a vaccine.
370	You don't vaccinate a few children.
372	You vaccinate all the children in an area.
