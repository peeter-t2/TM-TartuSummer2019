15.461	The theme of my talk today is,
17.153	"""Be an artist, right now."""
20.361	Most people, when this subject is brought up,
23.418	get tense and resist it:
26.044	"""Art doesn't feed me, and right now I'm busy."
29.038	I have to go to school, get a job,
31.414	"send my kids to lessons ... """
33.701	"You think, ""I'm too busy. I don't have time for art."""
39.236	There are hundreds of reasons why we can't be artists right now.
42.697	Don't they just pop into your head?
44.252	There are so many reasons why we can't be,
46.075	indeed, we're not sure why we should be.
48.635	We don't know why we should be artists,
50.328	but we have many reasons why we can't be.
54.231	Why do people instantly resist the idea of associating themselves with art?
58.606	Perhaps you think art is for the greatly gifted
62.474	or for the thoroughly and professionally trained.
67.526	And some of you may think you've strayed too far from art.
71.869	Well you might have, but I don't think so.
76.487	This is the theme of my talk today.
78.956	We are all born artists.
80.758	If you have kids, you know what I mean.
83.802	Almost everything kids do is art.
88.687	They draw with crayons on the wall.
91.265	They dance to Son Dam Bi's dance on TV,
94.417	but you can't even call it Son Dam Bi's dance -- it becomes the kids' own dance.
98.275	So they dance a strange dance and inflict their singing on everyone.
103.561	Perhaps their art is something only their parents can bear,
107.535	and because they practice such art all day long,
112.732	people honestly get a little tired around kids.
116.011	Kids will sometimes perform monodramas --
119.166	playing house is indeed a monodrama or a play.
122.712	And some kids, when they get a bit older,
125.391	start to lie.
127.411	Usually parents remember the very first time their kid lies.
132.502	They're shocked.
133.847	"""Now you're showing your true colors,"" Mom says. She thinks, ""Why does he take after his dad?"""
137.415	"She questions him, ""What kind of a person are you going to be?"""
140.621	But you shouldn't worry.
142.192	The moment kids start to lie is the moment storytelling begins.
148.412	They are talking about things they didn't see.
150.6	It's amazing. It's a wonderful moment.
152.391	Parents should celebrate.
154.458	"""Hurray! My boy finally started to lie!"""
158.615	All right! It calls for celebration.
160.844	"For example, a kid says, ""Mom, guess what? I met an alien on my way home."""
164.233	"Then a typical mom responds, ""Stop that nonsense."""
168.684	Now, an ideal parent is someone who responds like this:
172.3	"""Really? An alien, huh? What did it look like? Did it say anything?"
175.372	"Where did you meet it?"" ""Um, in front of the supermarket."""
177.076	When you have a conversation like this,
179.398	the kid has to come up with the next thing to say to be responsible for what he started.
185.773	Soon, a story develops.
187.937	Of course this is an infantile story,
192.414	but thinking up one sentence after the next
196.23	is the same thing a professional writer like me does.
200.298	In essence, they are not different.
202.677	Roland Barthes once said of Flaubert's novels,
205.363	"""Flaubert did not write a novel."
207.969	He merely connected one sentence after another.
210.974	"The eros between sentences, that is the essence of Flaubert's novel."""
215.701	That's right -- a novel, basically, is writing one sentence,
218.484	then, without violating the scope of the first one,
221.943	writing the next sentence.
223.648	And you continue to make connections.
225.157	Take a look at this sentence:
227.223	"""One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that in his bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug."""
229.69	"Yes, it's the first sentence of Franz Kafka's ""The Metamorphosis."""
232.136	Writing such an unjustifiable sentence
235.304	and continuing in order to justify it,
237.752	Kafka's work became the masterpiece of contemporary literature.
242.181	Kafka did not show his work to his father.
244.93	He was not on good terms with his father.
247.254	On his own, he wrote these sentences.
251.05	"Had he shown his father, ""My boy has finally lost it,"" he would've thought."
254.313	And that's right. Art is about going a little nuts
256.225	and justifying the next sentence,
258.472	which is not much different from what a kid does.
261.733	A kid who has just started to lie
263.264	is taking the first step as a storyteller.
266.39	Kids do art.
268.951	They don't get tired and they have fun doing it.
270.376	I was in Jeju Island a few days ago.
272.137	When kids are on the beach, most of them love playing in the water.
277.249	But some of them spend a lot of time in the sand,
280.156	making mountains and seas -- well, not seas,
282.4	but different things -- people and dogs, etc.
286.347	But parents tell them,
287.76	"""It will all be washed away by the waves."""
289.523	In other words, it's useless.
291.345	There's no need.
292.489	But kids don't mind.
294.355	They have fun in the moment
295.526	and they keep playing in the sand.
297.692	Kids don't do it because someone told them to.
299.958	They aren't told by their boss
301.554	or anyone, they just do it.
304.479	When you were little, I bet you spent time enjoying the pleasure of primitive art.
309.875	When I ask my students to write about their happiest moment,
314.237	many write about an early artistic experience they had as a kid.
320.161	Learning to play piano for the first time and playing four hands with a friend,
322.916	or performing a ridiculous skit with friends looking like idiots -- things like that.
327.932	Or the moment you developed the first film you shot with an old camera.
331.283	They talk about these kinds of experiences.
333.606	You must have had such a moment.
335.871	In that moment, art makes you happy
337.804	because it's not work.
339.481	Work doesn't make you happy, does it? Mostly it's tough.
342.014	The French writer Michel Tournier has a famous saying.
345.115	It's a bit mischievous, actually.
346.805	"""Work is against human nature. The proof is that it makes us tired."""
351.777	Right? Why would work tire us if it's in our nature?
353.262	Playing doesn't tire us.
354.923	We can play all night long.
356.358	If we work overnight, we should be paid for overtime.
358.791	Why? Because it's tiring and we feel fatigue.
362.075	But kids, usually they do art for fun. It's playing.
366.757	They don't draw to sell the work to a client
369.491	or play the piano to earn money for the family.
372.516	Of course, there were kids who had to.
375.292	You know this gentleman, right?
376.594	He had to tour around Europe to support his family --
380.68	Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart --
382.57	but that was centuries ago, so we can make him an exception.
385.533	Unfortunately, at some point our art -- such a joyful pastime -- ends.
389.398	Kids have to go to lessons, to school, do homework
392.788	and of course they take piano or ballet lessons,
396.306	but they aren't fun anymore.
398.075	You're told to do it and there's competition. How can it be fun?
401.407	If you're in elementary school and you still draw on the wall,
406.999	you'll surely get in trouble with your mom.
410.914	Besides,
414.781	if you continue to act like an artist as you get older,
417.361	you'll increasingly feel pressure --
421.029	people will question your actions and ask you to act properly.
427.084	Here's my story: I was an eighth grader and I entered a drawing contest at school in Gyeongbokgung.
433.271	I was trying my best, and my teacher came around
436.178	"and asked me, ""What are you doing?"""
439.766	"""I'm drawing diligently,"" I said."
441.58	"""Why are you using only black?"""
443.483	Indeed, I was eagerly coloring the sketchbook in black.
445.863	And I explained,
448.932	"""It's a dark night and a crow is perching on a branch."""
452.179	Then my teacher said,
453.177	"""Really? Well, Young-ha, you may not be good at drawing but you have a talent for storytelling."""
458.499	Or so I wished.
461.234	"""Now you'll get it, you rascal!"" was the response. (Laughter)"
464.002	"""You'll get it!"" he said."
465.606	You were supposed to draw the palace, the Gyeonghoeru, etc.,
468.288	but I was coloring everything in black,
470.723	so he dragged me out of the group.
472.407	There were a lot of girls there as well,
474.427	so I was utterly mortified.
475.978	None of my explanations or excuses were heard,
480.43	and I really got it big time.
483.643	If he was an ideal teacher, he would have responded like I said before,
488.161	"""Young-ha may not have a talent for drawing,"
490.474	"but he has a gift for making up stories,"" and he would have encouraged me."
493.849	But such a teacher is seldom found.
497.301	Later, I grew up and went to Europe's galleries --
500.264	I was a university student -- and I thought this was really unfair.
502.165	Look what I found. (Laughter)
507.563	Works like this were hung in Basel while I was punished
511.888	and stood in front of the palace with my drawing in my mouth.
517.281	Look at this. Doesn't it look just like wallpaper?
520.287	Contemporary art, I later discovered, isn't explained by a lame story like mine.
522.203	No crows are brought up.
526.148	Most of the works have no title, Untitled.
529.481	Anyways, contemporary art in the 20th century
532.582	is about doing something weird and filling the void with explanation and interpretation --
537.951	essentially the same as I did.
539.43	Of course, my work was very amateur,
542.178	but let's turn to more famous examples.
545.467	This is Picasso's.
548.068	"He stuck handlebars into a bike seat and called it ""Bull's Head."" Sounds convincing, right?"
553.869	"Next, a urinal was placed on its side and called ""Fountain""."
558.513	That was Duchamp.
560.107	So filling the gap between explanation and a weird act with stories --
564.557	that's indeed what contemporary art is all about.
568.684	Picasso even made the statement,
570.072	"""I draw not what I see but what I think."""
574.249	Yes, it means I didn't have to draw Gyeonghoeru.
576.766	I wish I knew what Picasso said back then. I could have argued better with my teacher.
580.837	Unfortunately, the little artists within us
584.639	are choked to death before we get to fight against the oppressors of art.
590.126	They get locked in.
591.731	That's our tragedy.
592.814	So what happens when little artists get locked in, banished or even killed?
598.074	Our artistic desire doesn't go away.
599.457	We want to express, to reveal ourselves,
602.554	but with the artist dead, the artistic desire reveals itself in dark form.
607.792	In karaoke bars, there are always people who sing
610.759	"""She's Gone"" or ""Hotel California,"""
613.301	miming the guitar riffs.
615.621	Usually they sound awful. Awful indeed.
617.863	Some people turn into rockers like this.
620.342	Or some people dance in clubs.
622.415	People who would have enjoyed telling stories
625.817	end up trolling on the Internet all night long.
628.827	That's how a writing talent reveals itself on the dark side.
632.222	Sometimes we see dads get more excited than their kids
636.175	playing with Legos or putting together plastic robots.
639.16	"They go, ""Don't touch it. Daddy will do it for you."""
640.893	The kid has already lost interest and is doing something else,
642.528	but the dad alone builds castles.
646.537	This shows the artistic impulses inside us are suppressed, not gone.
651.015	But they can often reveal themselves negatively, in the form of jealousy.
654.807	"You know the song ""I would love to be on TV""? Why would we love it?"
660.101	TV is full of people who do what we wished to do,
663.929	but never got to.
665.869	They dance, they act -- and the more they do, they are praised.
671.998	So we start to envy them.
675.148	We become dictators with a remote and start to criticize the people on TV.
679.242	"""He just can't act."" ""You call that singing? She can't hit the notes."""
685.095	We easily say these sorts of things.
687.385	We get jealous, not because we're evil,
690.328	but because we have little artists pent up inside us.
694.865	That's what I think.
698.451	What should we do then?
700.289	Yes, that's right.
701.066	Right now, we need to start our own art.
704.26	Right this minute, we can turn off TV,
705.269	log off the Internet,
707.718	get up and start to do something.
710.418	Where I teach students in drama school,
712.153	there's a course called Dramatics.
714.887	In this course, all students must put on a play.
719.077	However, acting majors are not supposed to act.
723.189	They can write the play, for example,
725.209	and the writers may work on stage art.
727.933	Likewise, stage art majors may become actors, and in this way you put on a show.
730.244	Students at first wonder whether they can actually do it,
733.992	but later they have so much fun. I rarely see anyone who is miserable doing a play.
738.555	In school, the military or even in a mental institution, once you make people do it, they enjoy it.
742.717	I saw this happen in the army -- many people had fun doing plays.
747.613	I have another experience:
750.545	In my writing class, I give students a special assignment.
754.179	I have students like you in the class -- many who don't major in writing.
760.079	Some major in art or music and think they can't write.
764.656	So I give them blank sheets of paper and a theme.
768.383	It can be a simple theme:
769.997	Write about the most unfortunate experience in your childhood.
772.511	There's one condition: You must write like crazy. Like crazy!
776.424	I walk around and encourage them,
779.157	"""Come on, come on!"" They have to write like crazy for an hour or two."
782.901	They only get to think for the first five minutes.
786.109	The reason I make them write like crazy is because
789.331	when you write slowly and lots of thoughts cross your mind,
792.089	the artistic devil creeps in.
794.536	This devil will tell you hundreds of reasons
798.568	why you can't write:
801.498	"""People will laugh at you. This is not good writing!"
804.333	"What kind of sentence is this? Look at your handwriting!"""
805.883	It will say a lot of things.
807.46	You have to run fast so the devil can't catch up.
809.964	The really good writing I've seen in my class
814.036	was not from the assignments with a long deadline,
816.709	but from the 40- to 60-minute crazy writing students did
820.193	in front of me with a pencil.
823.595	The students go into a kind of trance.
825.434	After 30 or 40 minutes, they write without knowing what they're writing.
829.896	And in this moment, the nagging devil disappears.
832.861	So I can say this:
834.57	It's not the hundreds of reasons why one can't be an artist,
838.585	but rather, the one reason one must be that makes us artists.
842.835	Why we cannot be something is not important.
844.544	Most artists became artists because of the one reason.
847.694	When we put the devil in our heart to sleep and start our own art,
851.364	enemies appear on the outside.
853.698	Mostly, they have the faces of our parents. (Laughter)
856.554	Sometimes they look like our spouses,
859.655	but they are not your parents or spouses.
861.423	They are devils. Devils.
864.317	They came to Earth briefly transformed
866.261	to stop you from being artistic, from becoming artists.
870.207	And they have a magic question.
872.129	"When we say, ""I think I'll try acting. There's a drama school in the community center,"" or"
878.287	"""I'd like to learn Italian songs,"" they ask, ""Oh, yeah? A play? What for?"""
882.764	"The magic question is, ""What for?"""
886.426	But art is not for anything.
890.138	Art is the ultimate goal.
892.392	It saves our souls and makes us live happily.
896.532	It helps us express ourselves and be happy without the help of alcohol or drugs.
902.038	So in response to such a pragmatic question,
906.378	we need to be bold.
908.797	"""Well, just for the fun of it. Sorry for having fun without you,"""
913.241	"is what you should say. ""I'll just go ahead and do it anyway."""
917.266	The ideal future I imagine is where we all have multiple identities,
922.366	at least one of which is an artist.
926.147	Once I was in New York and got in a cab. I took the backseat,
929.316	and in front of me I saw something related to a play.
933.473	"So I asked the driver, ""What is this?"""
934.61	"He said it was his profile. ""Then what are you?"" I asked. ""An actor,"" he said."
938.655	"He was a cabby and an actor. I asked, ""What roles do you usually play?"""
942.078	He proudly said he played King Lear.
944.104	King Lear.
945.549	"""Who is it that can tell me who I am?"" -- a great line from King Lear."
947.175	That's the world I dream of.
950.566	Someone is a golfer by day and writer by night.
954.501	Or a cabby and an actor, a banker and a painter,
957.02	secretly or publicly performing their own arts.
962.596	In 1990, Martha Graham, the legend of modern dance, came to Korea.
967.467	The great artist, then in her 90s, arrived at Gimpo Airport
973.239	and a reporter asked her a typical question:
976.304	"""What do you have to do to become a great dancer?"
978.911	"Any advice for aspiring Korean dancers?"""
981.491	Now, she was the master. This photo was taken in 1948 and she was already a celebrated artist.
986.486	In 1990, she was asked this question.
988.677	And here's what she answered:
991.361	"""Just do it."""
995.278	Wow. I was touched.
996.796	Only those three words and she left the airport. That's it.
1000.888	So what should we do now?
1004.119	Let's be artists, right now. Right away. How?
1007.845	Just do it!
1008.837	Thank you.
1010.451	(Applause)
