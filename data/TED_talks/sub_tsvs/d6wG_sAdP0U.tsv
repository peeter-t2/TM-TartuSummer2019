12.563	So my name is Amy Webb,
15.105	and a few years ago
15.105	I found myself at the end
17.802	of yet another fantastic relationship
20.438	that came burning down
20.438	in a spectacular fashion.
24.042	And I thought, what's wrong with me?
26.802	I don't understand
26.802	why this keeps happening.
28.884	So I asked everybody in my life
28.884	what they thought.
32.383	I turned to my grandmother,
32.383	who always had plenty of advice,
36.383	"and she said, ""Stop being so picky."
39.375	You've got to date around.
40.753	And most importantly,
42.131	true love will find you
42.131	"when you least expect it."""
46.336	Now as it turns out,
48.055	I'm somebody who thinks a lot about data,
50.612	as you'll soon find.
51.911	I am constantly swimming
51.911	in numbers, formulas and charts.
57.101	I also have a very tight-knit family,
59.501	and I'm very, very close with my sister,
61.512	and as a result, I wanted to have
61.512	the same type of family when I grew up.
64.988	So I'm at the end of this bad breakup,
66.885	I'm 30 years old,
68.112	I figure I'm probably going to have
68.112	to date somebody for about six months
71.839	before I'm ready to get monogamous
73.681	and before we can sort of cohabitate,
75.484	and we have to do that
75.484	for a while before we can get engaged.
78.433	And if I want to start having children
78.433	by the time I'm 35,
81.426	that meant that I would have
81.426	had to have been on my way to marriage
84.627	five years ago.
86.171	So that wasn't going to work.
87.607	If my strategy was to least-expect
87.607	my way into true love,
91.354	then the variable that I had
91.354	to deal with was serendipity.
94.881	In short, I was trying to figure out
97.041	what's the probability
97.041	of my finding Mr. Right?
100.381	Well, at the time I was living
100.381	in the city of Philadelphia,
103.206	and it's a big city, and I figured,
105.325	in this entire place,
105.325	there are lots of possibilities.
108.316	So again, I started doing some math.
110.66	Population of Philadelphia:
110.66	it has 1.5 million people.
114.394	I figure about half of that are men,
116.133	so that takes the number down to 750,000.
118.727	I'm looking for a guy
118.727	between the ages of 30 and 36,
121.936	which was only four percent
121.936	of the population,
124.491	so now I'm dealing
124.491	with the possibility of 30,000 men.
127.092	I was looking for somebody who was Jewish,
129.117	because I am and that was important to me.
131.365	That's only 2.3 percent of the population.
133.904	I figure I'm attracted to maybe
133.904	one out of 10 of those men,
138.053	and there was no way I was going to deal
138.053	with somebody who was an avid golfer.
142.89	So that basically meant
142.89	there were 35 men for me
145.95	that I could possibly date
148.178	in the entire city of Philadelphia.
152.349	In the meantime,
152.349	my very large Jewish family
155.561	was already all married
155.561	and well on their way
158.363	to having lots and lots of children,
160.274	and I felt like I was
160.274	under tremendous peer pressure
162.775	to get my life going already.
164.565	So I have two possible
164.565	strategies at this point
166.97	I'm sort of figuring out.
168.228	One, I can take my grandmother's advice
170.528	and sort of least-expect my way
172.784	into maybe bumping into the one
172.784	out of 35 possible men
176.999	in the entire 1.5-million-person
176.999	city of Philadelphia,
181.196	or I could try online dating.
184.221	Now, I like the idea of online dating,
186.366	because it's predicated on an algorithm,
188.367	and that's really just
188.367	a simple way of saying
190.516	I've got a problem,
190.516	I'm going to use some data,
192.832	run it through a system
192.832	and get to a solution.
196.317	So online dating is the second
196.317	most popular way
198.609	that people now meet each other,
200.267	but as it turns out,
200.267	algorithms have been around
202.577	for thousands of years
202.577	in almost every culture.
205.862	In fact, in Judaism,
205.862	there were matchmakers a long time ago,
209.359	and though they didn't have
209.359	an explicit algorithm per se,
212.07	they definitely were running
212.07	through formulas in their heads,
215.109	like, is the girl going to like the boy?
217.076	Are the families going to get along?
218.816	What's the rabbi going to say?
220.269	Are they going to start
220.269	having children right away?
222.68	The matchmaker would sort
222.68	of think through all of this,
225.33	put two people together,
225.33	and that would be the end of it.
228.052	So in my case, I thought,
229.818	well, will data and an algorithm
229.818	lead me to my Prince Charming?
234.563	So I decided to sign on.
236.019	Now, there was one small catch.
237.869	As I'm signing on to the various
237.869	dating websites,
240.5	as it happens, I was really, really busy.
242.795	But that actually
242.795	wasn't the biggest problem.
245.533	The biggest problem is that I hate
245.533	filling out questionnaires of any kind,
249.577	and I certainly don't like questionnaires
249.577	that are like Cosmo quizzes.
253.98	So I just copied
253.98	and pasted from my résumé.
256.478	(Laughter)
261.935	So in the descriptive part up top,
264.583	I said that I was
264.583	an award-winning journalist
266.909	and a future thinker.
268.539	When I was asked about fun activities
268.539	and my ideal date,
271.901	I said monetization
271.901	and fluency in Japanese.
276.111	I talked a lot about JavaScript.
277.828	(Laughter)
279.075	So obviously this was not the best way
279.075	to put my most sexy foot forward.
285.805	But the real failure was that
285.805	there were plenty of men for me to date.
290.251	These algorithms had a sea full of men
292.712	that wanted to take me out
292.712	on lots of dates --
295.418	what turned out to be truly awful dates.
299.256	There was this guy Steve, the I.T. guy.
301.93	The algorithm matched us up
301.93	because we share a love of gadgets,
305.152	we share a love of math
305.152	and data and '80s music,
309.221	and so I agreed to go out with him.
311.194	So Steve the I.T. guy invited me out
313.851	to one of Philadelphia's
313.851	white-table-cloth,
315.945	extremely expensive restaurants.
317.652	And we went in, and right off the bat,
319.715	our conversation really
319.715	wasn't taking flight,
322.975	but he was ordering a lot of food.
324.804	In fact, he didn't even bother
324.804	looking at the menu.
327.257	He was ordering multiple appetizers,
327.257	multiple entrées, for me as well,
331.156	and suddenly there are piles
331.156	and piles of food on our table,
334.038	also lots and lots of bottles of wine.
336.116	So we're nearing the end
336.116	of our conversation
338.297	and the end of dinner, and I've decided
340.218	Steve the I.T. guy and I are really
340.218	just not meant for each other,
343.352	but we'll part ways as friends,
344.939	when he gets up to go to the bathroom,
347.388	and in the meantime,
347.388	the bill comes to our table.
351	And listen, I'm a modern woman.
353.588	I am totally down with splitting the bill.
356.549	But then Steve the I.T. guy
356.549	didn't come back.
359.105	(Gasping)
360.215	And that was my entire month's rent.
363.62	(Audience gasps)
364.978	So needless to say,
364.978	I was not having a good night.
368.251	So I run home, I call
368.251	my mother, I call my sister,
371.952	and as I do, at the end of each one
371.952	of these terrible, terrible dates,
376.15	I regale them with the details.
378.271	And they say to me,
380.402	"""Stop complaining."""
382.021	(Laughter)
383.98	"""You're just being too picky."""
386.312	So I said, fine, from here on out
386.312	I'm only going on dates
389.51	where I know there's Wi-Fi,
389.51	and I'm bringing my laptop.
392.237	I'm going to shove it into my bag,
393.896	I'm going to have this email template,
395.753	and I'm going to fill it out
395.753	and collect information
398.206	on all these different
398.206	data points during the date
400.646	to prove to everybody that empirically,
402.528	these dates really are terrible.
404.129	(Laughter)
405.176	So I started tracking things like
405.176	really stupid, awkward, sexual remarks;
409.294	bad vocabulary;
411.473	the number of times a man
411.473	forced me to high-five him.
414.528	(Laughter)
416.702	So I started to crunch some numbers,
421.092	and that allowed me
421.092	to make some correlations.
423.767	So as it turns out,
426.391	for some reason, men who drink Scotch
426.391	reference kinky sex immediately.
431.489	(Laughter)
433.626	Well, it turns out
433.626	that these probably weren't bad guys.
437.89	There were just bad for me.
439.8	And as it happens, the algorithms
439.8	that were setting us up,
443.475	they weren't bad either.
444.88	These algorithms were doing exactly
444.88	what they were designed to do,
448.173	which was to take
448.173	our user-generated information,
450.788	in my case, my résumé,
452.292	and match it up
452.292	with other people's information.
455.319	See, the real problem here is that,
457.01	while the algorithms work just fine,
458.978	you and I don't,
460.233	when confronted with blank windows
462.37	where we're supposed to input
462.37	our information online.
464.895	Very few of us have the ability
466.57	to be totally and brutally
466.57	honest with ourselves.
470.046	The other problem
470.046	is that these websites are asking us
472.642	questions like, are you
472.642	a dog person or a cat person?
475.52	Do you like horror films or romance films?
478.505	I'm not looking for a pen pal.
480.259	I'm looking for a husband. Right?
482.169	So there's a certain amount
482.169	of superficiality in that data.
485.584	So I said fine, I've got a new plan.
488.154	I'm going to keep using
488.154	these online dating sites,
490.559	but I'm going to treat them as databases,
493.044	and rather than waiting
493.044	for an algorithm to set me up,
495.733	I think I'm going to try
495.733	reverse-engineering this entire system.
499.44	So knowing that there was superficial data
502.425	that was being used
502.425	to match me up with other people,
504.973	I decided instead to ask my own questions.
507.424	What was every single possible thing
509.178	that I could think of
509.178	that I was looking for in a mate?
511.839	So I started writing
513.766	and writing and writing,
516.482	and at the end, I had amassed
521.301	I wanted somebody was Jew-ish,
523.579	so I was looking for somebody
525.176	who had the same background
525.176	and thoughts on our culture,
527.93	but wasn't going to force me to go to shul
527.93	every Friday and Saturday.
531.743	I wanted somebody who worked hard,
533.387	because work for me
533.387	is extremely important,
535.459	but not too hard.
537.035	For me, the hobbies that I have
538.567	are really just new work projects
538.567	that I've launched.
541.432	I also wanted somebody
541.432	who not only wanted two children,
544.516	but was going to have the same
544.516	attitude toward parenting that I do,
547.702	so somebody who was going
547.702	to be totally okay
549.789	with forcing our child to start
549.789	taking piano lessons at age three,
553.167	and also maybe computer science classes
553.167	if we could wrangle it.
558.333	So things like that,
558.333	but I also wanted somebody
560.643	who would go to far-flung,
560.643	exotic places, like Petra, Jordan.
564.148	I also wanted somebody who would weigh
567.71	regardless of what I weighed.
569.116	(Laughter)
571.227	So I now have
571.227	these 72 different data points,
574.139	which, to be fair, is a lot.
576.374	So what I did was, I went through
576.374	and I prioritized that list.
579.525	I broke it into a top tier
579.525	and a second tier of points,
583.342	and I ranked everything starting at 100
586.567	and going all the way down to 91,
588.817	and listing things like I was looking
588.817	for somebody who was really smart,
592.247	who would challenge and stimulate me,
594.034	and balancing that with a second tier
594.034	and a second set of points.
597.78	These things were also important to me
597.78	but not necessarily deal-breakers.
602.035	(Laughter)
604.127	So once I had all this done,
604.127	I then built a scoring system,
607.231	because what I wanted to do
607.231	was to sort of mathematically calculate
611.736	whether or not I thought
611.736	the guy that I found online
614.242	would be a match with me.
615.657	I figured there would be
615.657	a minimum of 700 points
618.188	before I would agree to email somebody
618.188	or respond to an email message.
621.812	For 900 points,
621.812	I'd agree to go out on a date,
624.027	and I wouldn't even consider
624.027	any kind of relationship
626.708	before somebody had crossed
626.708	the 1,500 point threshold.
630.683	Well, as it turns out,
630.683	this worked pretty well.
633.866	So I go back online now.
635.493	I found Jewishdoc57
638.119	who's incredibly good-looking,
638.119	incredibly well-spoken,
641.056	he had hiked Mt. Fuji,
642.774	he had walked along the Great Wall.
644.704	He likes to travel
645.879	as long as it doesn't involve
645.879	a cruise ship.
648.029	And I thought,
649.566	I've done it!
650.741	I've cracked the code.
652.3	I have just found
652.3	the Jewish Prince Charming
656.387	of my family's dreams.
658.736	There was only one problem:
661.685	He didn't like me back.
663.887	And I guess the one variable
663.887	that I haven't considered
666.973	is the competition.
668.866	Who are all of the other women
668.866	on these dating sites?
672.799	I found SmileyGirl1978.
676.584	"She said she was a ""Fun girl"
676.584	"who is Happy and Outgoing."""
679.332	"She listed her job as ""teacher."""
680.962	She said she is
680.962	"""silly, nice and friendly."""
683.38	"She likes to make people laugh ""alot."""
685.829	At this moment I knew,
687.4	clicking profile after profile
687.4	that looked like this,
690.509	that I needed to do some market research.
693.483	So I created 10 fake male profiles.
695.778	Now, before I lose all of you --
698.722	(Laughter) --
701.954	understand that I did this
701.954	strictly to gather data
706.2	about everybody else in the system.
707.948	I didn't carry on crazy Catfish-style
707.948	relationships with anybody.
712.259	I really was just scraping their data.
714.156	But I didn't want everybody's data.
716.124	I only wanted data on the women
716.124	who were going to be attracted
719.571	to the type of man that I really,
719.571	really wanted to marry.
722.834	When I released these men into the wild,
726.4	I did follow some rules.
727.702	So I didn't reach out to any woman first.
729.842	I just waited to see
729.842	who these profiles were going to attract,
732.819	and mainly what I was looking at
732.819	was two different data sets.
736.134	So I was looking at qualitative data,
737.92	so what was the humor, the tone,
739.621	the voice, the communication style
741.265	that these women shared in common?
743.033	And also quantitative data,
744.343	so what was the average length
744.343	of their profile,
746.654	how much time was spent between messages?
749.047	What I was trying to get at here was
749.047	that I figured, in person,
752.495	I would be just as competitive
752.495	as a SmileyGirl1978.
755.97	I wanted to figure out how to maximize
755.97	my own profile online.
760.899	Well, one month later,
762.537	I had a lot of data,
762.537	and I was able to do another analysis.
766.29	And as it turns out,
766.29	content matters a lot.
769.17	So smart people tend to write a lot --
772.145	3,000, 4,000, 5,000 words
772.145	about themselves,
775.494	which may all be very, very interesting.
777.821	The challenge here, though,
777.821	is that the popular men and women
780.725	are sticking to 97 words on average
783.946	that are written very, very well,
785.89	even though it may not seem
785.89	like it all the time.
788.558	The other hallmark
788.558	of the people who do this well
790.921	is that they're using
790.921	non-specific language.
793.048	So in my case,
794.374	"""The English Patient"""
794.374	is my most favorite movie ever,
797.984	but it doesn't work
797.984	to use that in a profile,
801.157	because that's a superficial data point,
803.135	and somebody may disagree
804.351	and decide they don't want to go out
806.118	because they didn't like
806.118	sitting through the three-hour movie.
809.106	Also, optimistic language matters a lot.
811.11	So this is a word cloud
812.346	highlighting the most popular
812.346	words that were used
814.806	by the most popular women,
816.138	"words like ""fun"" and ""girl"" and ""love."""
818.828	And what I realized was not
818.828	that I had to dumb down my own profile.
822.392	Remember, I'm somebody who said
823.924	that I speak fluent Japanese
823.924	and I know JavaScript
826.967	and I was okay with that.
828.712	The difference is that it's about being
828.712	more approachable
831.494	and helping people understand
831.494	the best way to reach out to you.
835.045	And as it turns out, timing
835.045	is also really, really important.
838.089	Just because you have access
838.089	to somebody's mobile phone number
841.361	or their instant message account
843.117	and it's 2 o'clock in the morning
843.117	and you happen to be awake,
846.056	doesn't mean that that's a good time
846.056	to communicate with those people.
849.395	The popular women on these online sites
851.362	spend an average of 23 hours
851.362	in between each communication.
855.265	And that's what we would normally do
855.265	in the usual process of courtship.
859.571	And finally --
861.592	there were the photos.
863.171	All of the women who were popular
863.171	showed some skin.
866.22	They all looked really great,
868.446	which turned out to be in sharp contrast
871.348	to what I had uploaded.
872.872	(Laughter)
874.634	Once I had all of this information,
876.364	I was able to create a super profile,
878.501	so it was still me,
880.526	but it was me optimized now
880.526	for this ecosystem.
884.431	And as it turns out,
884.431	I did a really good job.
889.134	I was the most popular person online.
892.19	(Laughter)
894.709	(Applause)
898.923	And as it turns out, lots and lots
898.923	of men wanted to date me.
902.41	So I call my mom, I call my sister,
902.41	I call my grandmother.
905.235	I'm telling them about this fabulous news,
907.388	"and they say, ""This is wonderful!"
907.388	"How soon are you going out?"""
910.641	"I said, ""Actually, I'm not going"
910.641	"to go out with anybody."""
913.347	Because remember, in my scoring system,
915.245	they have to reach a minimum
915.245	threshold of 700 points,
917.765	and none of them have done that.
919.75	"They said, ""What?"
919.75	"You're still being too damn picky."""
922.431	Well, not too long after that,
922.431	I found this guy, Thevenin,
925.989	and he said that he was culturally Jewish,
929.004	he said that his job
929.004	was an arctic baby seal hunter,
932.544	which I thought was very clever.
934.344	He talked in detail about travel.
937.221	He made a lot of really
937.221	interesting cultural references.
939.912	He looked and talked exactly
939.912	like what I wanted,
942.678	and immediately, he scored 850 points.
945.836	It was enough for a date.
947.524	Three weeks later, we met up in person
949.64	for what turned out to be
949.64	a 14-hour-long conversation
953.144	that went from coffee shop to restaurant
955.215	to another coffee shop
955.215	to another restaurant,
957.396	and when he dropped me back off
957.396	at my house that night
959.944	I re-scored him --
961.119	[1,050 points!]
962.309	Thought, you know what,
963.606	this entire time,
963.606	I haven't been picky enough.
966.849	Well, a year and a half after that,
968.579	we were non-cruise ship traveling
971.126	through Petra, Jordan,
973.211	when he got down on his knee and proposed.
976.68	A year after that, we were married,
979.183	and about a year and a half after that,
981.086	our daughter, Petra, was born.
983.33	Audience: Oh!
985.099	(Applause)
987.664	[What it means...]
990.846	Obviously, I'm having
990.846	a fabulous life, so --
993.09	(Laughter)
994.65	The question is, what does
994.65	all of this mean for you?
997.146	Well, as it turns out,
997.146	there is an algorithm for love.
1000.994	It's just not the ones
1000.994	that we're being presented with online.
1004.69	In fact, it's something
1004.69	that you write yourself.
1007	So whether you're looking
1007	for a husband or a wife
1009.358	or you're trying to find your passion
1011.239	or you're trying to start a business,
1013.025	all you have to really do
1013.025	is figure out your own framework
1015.903	and play by your own rules,
1017.687	and feel free to be as picky as you want.
1020.327	Well, on my wedding day,
1021.787	I had a conversation again
1021.787	with my grandmother,
1024.05	"and she said, ""All right,"
1024.05	maybe I was wrong.
1026.49	It looks like you did come up
1026.49	with a really, really great system.
1029.929	Now, your matzah balls ...
1033.072	"They should be fluffy, not hard."""
1034.977	(Laughter)
1036.159	And I'll take her advice on that.
1037.767	(Applause)
