15.26	The anger in me against corruption
19.26	made me to make a big career change
22.26	last year, becoming a full-time practicing lawyer.
26.26	My experiences over the last 18 months,
30.26	as a lawyer, has seeded in me
32.26	a new entrepreneurial idea,
35.26	which I believe is indeed
37.26	worth spreading.
39.26	So, I share it with all of you here today,
42.26	though the idea itself is getting crystallized
44.26	and I'm still writing up the business plan.
47.26	Of course it helps that fear of public failure
50.26	diminishes as the number of ideas
53.26	which have failed increases.
57.26	I've been a huge fan of enterprise and entrepreneurship
60.26	since 1993.
62.26	I've explored, experienced,
64.26	and experimented enterprise
66.26	and capitalism to my heart's content.
69.26	I built, along with my two brothers,
71.26	the leading real estate company in my home state, Kerala,
75.26	and then worked professionally
77.26	with two of India's biggest businessmen,
80.26	but in their startup enterprises.
83.26	In 2003, when I stepped out of the pure play capitalistic sector
88.26	to work on so-called social sector issues,
92.26	I definitely did not have any grand strategy
96.26	or plan to pursue and find
99.26	for-profit solutions
101.26	to addressing pressing public issues.
104.26	When life brought about a series
106.26	of death and near-death experiences
109.26	within my close circle,
111.26	which highlighted the need
113.26	for an emergency medical response service in India,
116.26	similar to 911 in USA.
119.26	To address this, I, along with four friends,
122.26	founded Ambulance Access for All,
124.26	to promote life-support ambulance services in India.
128.26	For those from the developing world,
130.26	there is nothing, absolutely nothing new in this idea.
133.26	But as we envisioned it,
135.26	we had three key goals:
137.26	Providing world-class life support ambulance service
140.26	which is fully self-sustainable from its own revenue streams,
143.26	and universally accessible
145.26	to anyone in a medical emergency,
148.26	irrespective of the capability to pay.
151.26	The service which grew out of this,
153.26	Dial 1298 for Ambulance,
155.26	with one ambulance in 2004,
158.26	now has a hundred-plus ambulances in three states,
161.26	and has transported over 100,000 patients
164.26	and victims since inception.
166.26	The service is -- (Applause)
169.26	fully self-sustainable from its own revenues,
172.26	without accessing any public funds,
174.26	and the cross-subsidy model actually works,
178.26	where the rich pays higher, poor pays lower,
181.26	and the accident victim is getting the service free of charge.
185.26	The service responded effectively
187.26	and efficiently,
189.26	during the unfortunate
194.26	And as you can see from the visuals,
198.26	the service was responding and rescuing
201.26	victims from the incident locations
204.26	even before the police could cordon off
207.26	the incident locations
210.26	and formally confirm it as a terror strike.
213.26	We ended up being the first medical response team
217.26	in every incident location
220.26	and transported 125 victims,
223.26	saving life.
225.26	(Applause)
230.26	In tribute and remembrance
234.26	of 26/11 attacks
238.26	over the last one year,
241.26	we have actually helped a Pakistani NGO,
244.26	Aman Foundation,
247.26	to set up a self-sustainable life support ambulance service
251.26	in Karachi, facilitated by Acumen Fund.
254.26	(Applause)
260.26	It's a small message from us,
264.26	in our own small way
266.26	to the enemies of humanity,
268.26	of Islam, of South Asia,
271.26	of India, and of Pakistan,
274.26	that humanity will continue to bloom,
277.26	irrespective of such dastardly attacks.
279.26	Since then I've also co-founded two other social enterprises.
283.26	One is Education Access for All,
285.26	setting up schools in small-town India.
288.26	And the other is Moksha-Yug Access,
290.26	which is integrating rural supply chain
292.26	on the foundations of self-help group-based microfinance.
297.26	I guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right.
300.26	Because diligent investors and venture funds
303.26	have committed over 7.5 million dollars in funding.
307.26	With the significance being these funds have come in
309.26	as a QT capital, not as grant or as philanthropy.
313.26	Now I come back to the idea of the new social enterprise
316.26	that I'm exploring.
318.26	Corruption, bribes, and lack of transparency.
321.26	You may be surprised to know
323.26	that eight speakers yesterday
326.26	actually mentioned these terms in their talks.
329.26	Bribes and corruption have both a demand and a supply side,
332.26	with the supply side being mostly of
335.26	greedy corporate unethical businesses
337.26	and hapless common man.
339.26	And the demand side being mostly politicians,
342.26	bureaucrats and those who have discretionary power
344.26	vested with them.
346.26	According to World Bank estimate,
348.26	one trillion dollars is paid in bribes
351.26	every year, worsening the condition
353.26	of the already worse off.
355.26	Yet, if you analyze the common man,
358.26	he or she does not wake up every day and say,
361.26	"""Hmm, let me see who I can pay a bribe to today."""
364.26	"or, ""Let me see who I can corrupt today."""
367.26	Often it is the constraining or the back-to-the-wall situation
372.26	that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in
375.26	that leads him to pay a bribe.
377.26	In the modern day world, where time is premium
380.26	and battle for subsistence is unimaginably tough,
383.26	the hapless common man
385.26	simply gives in and pays the bribe just to get on with life.
390.26	Now, let me ask you another question.
392.26	Imagine you are being asked to pay a bribe
394.26	in your day-to-day life to get something done.
397.26	What do you do? Of course you can call the police.
400.26	But what is the use if the police department is in itself steeped in corruption?
404.26	Most definitely you don't want to pay the bribe.
407.26	But you also don't have the time, resources,
410.26	expertise or wherewithal to fight this.
413.26	Unfortunately, many of us in this room
417.26	are supporters of capitalist policies and market forces.
421.26	Yet the market forces around the world
424.26	have not yet thrown up a service where you can call in,
427.26	pay a fee, and fight the demand for a bribe.
430.26	Like a bribe buster service,
433.26	or 1-800-Fight-Bribes,
435.26	or www.stopbribes.org or
439.26	www.preventcorruption.org.
442.26	Such a service simply do not exist.
445.26	One image that has haunted me
447.26	from my early business days
449.26	is of a grandmother, 70 plus years, being harassed
452.26	by the bureaucrats in the town planning office.
455.26	All she needed was permission to build three steps
457.26	to her house, from ground level,
459.26	making it easier for her to enter and exit her house.
462.26	Yet the officer in charge would not simply give her the permit
465.26	for want of a bribe.
467.26	Even though it pricked my conscience then,
469.26	I could not, or rather I did not
471.26	tend to her or assist her,
474.26	because I was busy building my real estate company.
476.26	I don't want to be haunted by such images any more.
480.26	A group of us have been working on a pilot basis
482.26	to address individual instances of demands
485.26	for bribes for common services or entitlement.
488.26	And in all 42 cases where we have pushed back such demands
491.26	using existing and legitimate tools
494.26	like the Right to Information Act,
496.26	video, audio, or peer pressure,
499.26	we have successfully obtained whatever our clients
501.26	set out to achieve without actually paying a bribe.
505.26	And with the cost of these tools being substantially lower
508.26	than the bribe demanded.
510.26	I believe that these tools that worked in these 42 pilot cases
515.26	can be consolidated in standard processes
519.26	in a BPO kind of environment,
522.26	and made available on web, call-center
525.26	and franchise physical offices,
527.26	for a fee, to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe.
532.26	The target market is as tempting as it can get.
535.26	It can be worth up to one trillion dollars,
538.26	being paid in bribes every year,
540.26	or equal to India's GDP.
543.26	And it is an absolutely virgin market.
546.26	I propose to explore this idea further,
549.26	to examine the potential of creating
551.26	a for-profit, fee-based BPO
555.26	kind of service to stop bribes
557.26	and prevent corruption.
559.26	I do realize that the fight for justice
562.26	against corruption is never easy.
565.26	It never has been and it never will be.
567.26	In my last 18 months as a lawyer,
570.26	battling small- and large-scale corruption,
572.26	including the one perpetrated by India's biggest corporate scamster.
576.26	Through his charities
578.26	I have had three police cases filed against me
581.26	alleging trespass, impersonation and intimidation.
584.26	The battle against corruption
586.26	exacts a toll on ourselves,
588.26	our families, our friends, and even our kids.
592.26	Yet I believe the price we pay is well worth holding on
594.26	to our dignity and making the world a fairer place.
598.26	What gives us the courage?
600.26	As my close friend replied, when told
602.26	during the seeding days of the ambulance project
605.26	that it is an impossible task
607.26	and the founders are insane to chalk up their blue-chip jobs,
610.26	"I quote: ""Of course we cannot fail in this,"
613.26	at least in our own minds.
615.26	For we are insane people,
617.26	trying to do an impossible task.
619.26	"And an insane person does not know what an impossible task is."" Thank you."
623.26	(Applause)
631.26	Chris Anderson: Shaffi, that is a really exciting business idea.
636.26	Shaffi Mather: I just have to get through the initial days where I don't get eliminated.
640.26	(Laughter)
642.26	CA: What's on your mind?
643.26	I mean, give us a sense of the numbers here --
645.26	a typical bribe and a typical fee. I mean, what's in your head?
648.26	SM: So let me ... Let me give you an example.
652.26	Somebody who had applied for the passport.
655.26	The officer was just sitting on it
658.26	and was demanding around 3,000 rupees in bribes.
661.26	And he did not want to pay.
664.26	So we actually used the Right to Information Act,
666.26	which is equal to the Freedom of Information Act in the United States,
669.26	and pushed back the officers in this particular case.
674.26	And in all these 42 cases,
676.26	when we kept pushing them back,
679.26	there was three kinds of reaction.
681.26	A set of people actually say,
683.26	"""Oh, let me just grant it to them, and run away from it."""
686.26	Some people actually come back and say,
689.26	"""Oh, you want to screw me. Let me show you what I can do."""
692.26	And he will push us back.
694.26	So you take the next step, or use the next tool available
698.26	in what we are putting together,
700.26	and then he relents.
703.26	By the third time, in all 42 cases, we have achieved success.
706.26	CA: But if it's a 3,000-rupee, 70-dollar bribe,
711.26	what fee would you have to charge,
713.26	and can you actually make the business work?
715.26	SM: Well, actually the cost that we incurred
719.26	was less than 200 rupees.
722.26	So, it actually works.
725.26	CA: That's a high gross margin business. I like it.
728.26	(Laughter)
730.26	SM: I actually did not want to answer this on the TED stage.
733.26	CA: OK, so these are provisional numbers, no pricing guarantee.
737.26	If you can pull this off, you will be a global hero.
740.26	I mean, this could be huge.
742.26	Thank you so much for sharing this idea at TED.
744.26	(Applause)
