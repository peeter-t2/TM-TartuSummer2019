13.025	I have a confession to make.
17.433	As a scientist and engineer,
17.433	I've focused on efficiency for many years.
25.213	But efficiency can be a cult,
29.03	and today I'd like to tell you
29.03	about a journey
32.23	that moved me out of the cult
32.23	and back to a far richer reality.
40.091	A few years ago, after finishing my Ph.D. 
40.091	in London, I moved to Boston.
45.739	I lived in Boston and worked in Cambridge.
49.381	I bought a racing bicycle that summer,
52.576	and I bicycled every day to work.
55.306	To find my way, I used my phone.
57.692	It sent me over Mass. Ave.,
57.692	Massachusetts Avenue,
61.593	the shortest route from
61.593	Boston to Cambridge.
65.842	But after a month
67.909	that I was cycling every day
67.909	on the car-packed Mass. Ave.,
72.495	I took a different route one day.
75.734	I'm not entirely sure why I took
75.734	a different route that day, a detour.
80.795	I just remember a feeling of surprise;
85.184	surprise at finding a street with no cars,
89.247	as opposed to the nearby
89.247	Mass. Ave. full of cars;
93.078	surprise at finding a street 
93.078	draped by leaves and surrounded by trees.
98.395	But after the feeling 
98.395	of surprise, I felt shame.
103.695	How could I have been so blind?
106.822	For an entire month,
108.728	I was so trapped in my mobile app
111.816	that a journey to work
111.816	became one thing only:
115.322	the shortest path.
117.783	In this single journey,
117.783	there was no thought
120.876	of enjoying the road,
123.507	no pleasure in connecting with nature,
125.459	no possibility of looking
125.459	people in the eyes.
129.166	And why?
130.951	Because I was saving a minute
130.951	out of my commute.
136.33	Now let me ask you: Am I alone here?
140.399	How many of you have never used
140.399	a mapping app for finding directions?
146.227	Most of you, if not all, have.
148.146	And don't get me wrong -- mapping apps
148.146	are the greatest game-changer
153.239	for encouraging people
153.239	to explore the city.
155.816	You take your phone out
155.816	and you know immediately where to go.
159.993	However, the app also assumes
162.904	there are only a handful
162.904	of directions to the destination.
168.308	It has the power to make
168.308	those handful of directions
172.116	the definitive direction
172.116	to that destination.
177.015	After that experience, I changed.
179.685	I changed my research
179.685	from traditional data-mining
183.052	to understanding how people
183.052	experience the city.
187.324	I used computer science tools
189.553	to replicate social science
189.553	experiments at scale, at web scale.
194.996	I became captivated
194.996	by the beauty and genius
200.118	of traditional social science experiments
203.02	done by Jane Jacobs,
203.02	Stanley Milgram, Kevin Lynch.
207.525	The result of that research
207.525	has been the creation of new maps,
212.192	maps where you don't only find
212.192	the shortest path, the blue one,
217.021	but also the most enjoyable path,
220.342	the red one.
222.06	How was that possible?
225.662	Einstein once said,
227.513	"""Logic will get you from A to B."
230.999	"Imagination will take you everywhere."""
233.771	So with a bit of imagination,
235.689	we needed to understand
237.57	which parts of the city
237.57	people find beautiful.
241.935	At the University of Cambridge,
241.935	with colleagues,
244.582	we thought about this simple experiment.
247.74	If I were to show you
247.74	these two urban scenes,
250.898	and I were to ask you
250.898	which one is more beautiful,
253.684	which one would you say?
258.096	Don't be shy.
261.161	Who says A? Who says B?
264.411	Brilliant.
266.013	Based on that idea,
267.987	we built a crowdsourcing platform,
269.799	a web game.
270.913	Players are shown pairs of urban scenes,
273.792	and they're asked to choose which one 
273.792	is more beautiful, quiet and happy.
280.154	Based on thousands of user votes,
282.104	then we are able to see
282.104	where consensus emerges.
285.308	We are able to see which
285.308	are the urban scenes
288.513	that make people happy.
291.276	After that work, I joined Yahoo Labs,
294.225	and I teamed up with Luca and Rossano,
297.104	and together, we aggregated
297.104	those winning locations in London
300.38	to build a new map of the city,
303.726	a cartography weighted for human emotions.
307.993	On this cartography, you're not only
307.993	able to see and connect
311.825	from point A to point B 
311.825	the shortest segments,
316.677	but you're also able
316.677	to see the happy segment,
319.812	the beautiful path, the quiet path.
323.504	In tests, participants found the happy,
323.504	the beautiful, the quiet path
328.148	far more enjoyable than the shortest one,
331.723	and that just by adding
331.723	a few minutes to travel time.
337.528	Participants also love to attach
337.528	memories to places.
341.777	Shared memories --
341.777	that's where the old BBC building was;
346.676	and personal memories --
346.676	that's where I gave my first kiss.
351.601	They also recalled how some paths
351.601	smelled and sounded.
356.034	So what if we had a mapping tool
359.261	that would return
359.261	the most enjoyable routes
361.792	based not only on aesthetics
364.412	but also based on smell, sound, 
364.412	and memories?
367.721	That's where our research
367.721	is going right now.
371.826	More generally, my research,
374.028	what it tries to do is avoid
374.028	the danger of the single path,
378.626	to avoid robbing people of fully
378.626	experiencing the city in which they live.
383.827	Walk the path through the park,
383.827	not through the car park,
387.565	and you have an entirely different path.
389.957	Walk the path full of people you love
392.905	and not full of cars,
394.221	and you have an entirely different path.
395.939	It's that simple.
399.012	I would like to end with this thought:
401.822	"do you remember ""The Truman Show?"""
403.842	It's a media satire in which a real person
406.86	doesn't know he's living
406.86	in a fabricated world.
410.413	Perhaps we live in a world
410.413	fabricated for efficiency.
415.567	Look at some of your daily habits,
419.073	and as Truman did in the movie,
419.073	escape the fabricated world.
425.226	Why?
426.736	Well, if you think that adventure
426.736	is dangerous, try routine. It's deadly.
433.416	Thank you.
435.327	(Applause)
