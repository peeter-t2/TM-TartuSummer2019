15.26	Mountain biking in Israel
19.26	is something that I do with great passion
21.26	and commitment.
24.26	And when I'm on my bike,
26.26	I feel that I connect
28.26	with the profound beauty of Israel,
31.26	and I feel that I'm united
33.26	with this country's history
37.26	and biblical law.
39.26	And also, for me,
41.26	biking is a matter of empowerment.
43.26	When I reach the summit
45.26	of a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere,
47.26	I feel young,
49.26	invincible, eternal.
52.26	It's as if I'm connecting with some legacy
55.26	or with some energy
57.26	far greater than myself.
59.26	You can see my fellow riders
61.26	at the end of the picture,
63.26	looking at me with some concern.
66.26	And here is another picture of them.
68.26	Unfortunately, I cannot show their faces,
71.26	neither can I disclose their true names,
73.26	and that's because my fellow riders
75.26	are juvenile inmates,
77.26	offenders
79.26	spending time in a correction facility
81.26	about 20 minutes' ride from here --
84.26	well, like everything in Israel.
88.26	And I've been riding with these kids once a week,
91.26	every Tuesday, rain or shine, for the last four years
94.26	and by now, they've become a very big part of my life.
97.26	This story began four years ago.
100.26	The correction facility where they are locked up
102.26	happens to be right in the middle
104.26	of one of my usual trips,
106.26	and it's surrounded by barbed wires
108.26	and electric gates and armed guards.
110.26	So on one of these rides,
112.26	I talked my way into the compound
114.26	and went to see the warden.
117.26	I told the warden
119.26	that I wanted to start a mountain biking club in this place
122.26	and that basically I wanted to take the kids
124.26	from here to there.
127.26	"And I told him, ""Let's find a way"
129.26	in which I'll be able to take out 10 kids once a week
132.26	"to ride with in the summer in the country."""
135.26	And the warden was quite amused,
137.26	and he told me he thought that I was a nut
140.26	and he told me,
142.26	"""This place is a correction facility. These guys are serious offenders."
145.26	They are supposed to be locked up.
147.26	"They aren't supposed to be out at large."""
150.26	And yet, we began to talk about it,
152.26	and one thing led to another.
154.26	And I can't see myself
157.26	going into a state prison in New Jersey
159.26	and making such a proposition,
161.26	but this being Israel,
163.26	the warden somehow made it happen.
166.26	And so two months later,
169.26	"we found ourselves ""at large"" --"
171.26	myself,
176.26	and a wonderful fellow named Russ,
178.26	who became a very good friend of mine
180.26	and my partner in this project.
182.26	And in the next few weeks, I had the tremendous pleasure
185.26	of introducing these kids
187.26	to the world of total freedom,
189.26	a world consisting of magnificent vistas
192.26	like these --
194.26	everything you see here is obviously in Israel --
197.26	as well as close encounters
199.26	with all sorts of small creatures
201.26	coming in all sorts of sizes,
203.26	colors, shapes, forms
206.26	and so on.
208.26	In spite of all this splendor,
211.26	the beginning was extremely frustrating.
214.26	Every small obstacle,
216.26	every slight uphill,
218.26	would cause these fellows
220.26	to stop in their tracks and give up.
223.26	So we had a lot of this going on.
226.26	I found out that they had a very hard time
228.26	dealing with frustration and difficulties --
230.26	not because they were physically unfit.
232.26	But that's one reason why they ended up where they were.
236.26	And I became increasingly more and more agitated,
238.26	because I was there
240.26	not only to be with them,
242.26	but also to ride and create a team
244.26	and I didn't know what to do.
246.26	Now, let me give you an example.
248.26	We're going downhill in some rocky terrain,
251.26	and the front tire of Alex
254.26	gets caught in one of these crevasses here.
256.26	So he crashes down,
258.26	and he gets slightly injured,
260.26	but this does not prevent him from jumping up
263.26	and then starting to jump up and down on his bike
265.26	and curse violently.
267.26	Then he throws his helmet in the air.
270.26	His backpack goes ballistic in some other direction.
273.26	And then he runs to the nearest tree
275.26	and starts to break branches and throw rocks
278.26	and curse like I've never heard.
281.26	And I'm just standing there,
284.26	watching this scene
286.26	with a complete disbelief,
288.26	not knowing what to do.
291.26	I'm used to algorithms
293.26	and data structures
296.26	and super motivated students,
299.26	and nothing in my background
301.26	prepared me to deal
303.26	with a raging, violent adolescent
306.26	in the middle of nowhere.
308.26	And you have to realize that these incidents
310.26	did not happen in convenient locations.
312.26	They happened in places like this,
315.26	in the Judean Desert,
320.26	And what you don't see in this picture
322.26	is that somewhere between these riders there,
325.26	there's a teenager sitting on a rock,
327.26	"saying, ""I'm not moving from here. Forget it."
329.26	"I've had it."""
331.26	Well, that's a problem
333.26	because one way or another, you have to get this guy moving
336.26	because it's getting dark soon and dangerous.
339.26	It took me several such incidents to figure out what I was supposed to do.
342.26	At the beginning, it was a disaster.
344.26	I tried harsh words and threats
346.26	and they took me nowhere.
348.26	That's what they had all their lives.
350.26	And at some point I found out,
353.26	when a kid like this gets into a fit,
355.26	the best thing that you can possibly do
357.26	is stay as close as possible to this kid,
360.26	which is difficult,
362.26	because what you really want to do is go away.
364.26	But that's what he had all his life,
366.26	people walking away from him.
368.26	So what you have to do is stay close
370.26	and try to reach in
372.26	and pet his shoulder
374.26	or give him a piece of chocolate.
376.26	"So I would say, ""Alex, I know that it's terribly difficult."
379.26	Why don't you rest for a few minutes
381.26	"and then we'll go on."""
383.26	"""Go away you maniac-psychopath."
386.26	"Why would you bring us to this goddamn place?"""
390.26	"And I would say, ""Relax, Alex."
393.26	"Here's a piece of chocolate."""
395.26	"And Alex would go, ""Arrrrggg!"""
397.26	Because you have to understand
399.26	that on these rides we are constantly hungry --
401.26	and after the rides also.
405.26	And who is this guy, Alex, to begin with?
408.26	He's a 17-year-old.
410.26	When he was eight,
412.26	someone put him on a boat in Odessa
415.26	and sent him, shipped him to Israel
418.26	on his own.
420.26	And he ended up in south Tel Aviv
422.26	and did not have the good luck
424.26	to be picked up by a [unclear]
426.26	and roamed the streets
428.26	and became a prominent gang member.
431.26	And he spent the last 10 years of his life
433.26	in two places only,
435.26	the slums and the state prison,
438.26	where he spent the last two years
440.26	before he ended up sitting on this rock there.
443.26	And so this kid
445.26	was probably abused,
448.26	abandoned, ignored, betrayed
451.26	by almost every adult along the way.
453.26	So, for such a kid,
455.26	when an adult that he learns to respect stays close to him
458.26	and doesn't walk away from him
460.26	in any situation,
462.26	irrespective of how he behaves,
465.26	it's a tremendous healing experience.
468.26	It's an act of unconditional acceptance,
471.26	something that he never had.
473.26	I want to say a few words about vision.
475.26	When I started this program four years ago,
478.26	I had this original plan
481.26	of creating a team
483.26	of winning underdogs.
485.26	I had an image of Lance Armstrong
488.26	in my mind.
490.26	And it took me exactly two months
493.26	of complete frustration
495.26	to realize that this vision
497.26	was misplaced,
499.26	and that there was another vision
501.26	supremely more important
503.26	and more readily available.
506.26	It all of a sudden dawned on me, in this project,
509.26	that the purpose of these rides
511.26	should actually be
513.26	to expose the kids
515.26	to one thing only: love.
518.26	Love to the country, to the uphill
520.26	and the downhill,
522.26	to all the incredible creatures that surround us --
525.26	the animals, the plants,
527.26	the insects --
529.26	love and respect
531.26	to other fellow members in your team,
533.26	in your biking team,
535.26	and most importantly,
537.26	love and respect to yourself,
539.26	which is something
541.26	that they badly miss.
543.26	Together with the kids,
545.26	I also went through a remarkable transformation.
548.26	Now, I come from a cutthroat world
550.26	of science and high technology.
552.26	I used to think that reason and logic
555.26	and relentless drive
557.26	were the only ways to make things happen.
559.26	And before I worked with the kids,
561.26	anything that I did with them,
563.26	or anything that I did with myself,
565.26	was supposed to be perfect,
567.26	ideal, optimal,
570.26	but after working with them for some time,
574.26	I discovered the great virtues of empathy
577.26	and flexibility
579.26	and being able to start with some vision,
581.26	and if the vision doesn't work, well nothing happened.
584.26	All you have to do is play with it, change it a little bit,
587.26	and come up with something that does help, that does work.
590.26	So right now, I feel more
592.26	like these are my principles,
594.26	and if you don't like them,
596.26	I have others.
598.26	(Laughter)
600.26	(Applause)
605.26	And one of these principles
607.26	is focus.
609.26	Before each ride
611.26	we sit together with the kids,
613.26	and we give them one word
615.26	to think about during the ride.
617.26	You have to focus their attention on something
620.26	because so many things happen.
622.26	"So these are words like ""teamwork"""
624.26	"or ""endurance"""
626.26	or even complicated concepts
628.26	"like ""resource allocation"""
630.26	"or ""perspective,"" a word that they don't understand."
632.26	You know, perspective
634.26	is one of these critically important
636.26	life-coping strategies
638.26	that mountain biking can really teach you.
641.26	I tell kids
643.26	when they struggle through some uphill
646.26	and feel like they cannot take it anymore,
648.26	it really helps to ignore the immediate obstacles
651.26	and raise your head and look around
653.26	and see how the vista around you grows.
655.26	It literally propels you upwards.
658.26	That's what perspective is all about.
660.26	Or you can also look back in time
662.26	and realize that you've already conquered
664.26	steeper mountains before.
667.26	And that's how they develop self-esteem.
670.26	Now, let me give you an example of how it works.
672.26	You stand with your bike at the beginning of February.
675.26	It's very cold, and you're standing in one of these rainy days,
678.26	and it's drizzling
680.26	and cold and chilly,
683.26	and you're standing in, let's say, Yokneam.
686.26	And you look up at the sky through a hole in the clouds
689.26	you see the monastery at the top of the Muhraka --
692.26	that's where you're supposed to climb now --
694.26	"and you say, ""There's no way that I could possibly get there."""
697.26	And yet, two hours later
700.26	you find yourself standing on the roof of this monastery,
703.26	smeared with mud,
706.26	blood and sweat.
708.26	And you look down at Yokneam;
710.26	everything is so small and tiny.
712.26	"And you say, ""Hey, Alex. Look at this parking lot where we started."
714.26	It's that big.
716.26	"I can't believe that I did it."""
718.26	And that's the point
720.26	when you start loving yourself.
723.26	And so we talked about
725.26	these special words that we teach them.
727.26	And at the end of each ride, we sit together
730.26	and share moments
732.26	in which those special words of the day
735.26	popped up and made a difference,
737.26	and these discussions
739.26	can be extremely inspiring.
741.26	In one of them, one of the kids once said,
743.26	"""When we were riding on this ridge"
745.26	overlooking the Dead Sea --
747.26	and he's talking about this spot here --
750.26	"""I was reminded"
752.26	of the day when I left my village in Ethiopia
754.26	and went away together with my brother.
757.26	We walked 120 kilometers
759.26	until we reached Sudan.
761.26	"This was the first place where we got some water and supplies."""
764.26	And he goes on saying, and everyone looks at him like a hero,
767.26	probably for the first time in his life.
769.26	And he says -- because I also have volunteers riding with me,
772.26	adults, who are sitting there
774.26	listening to him --
777.26	"and he says, ""And this was just the beginning"
779.26	of our ordeal
781.26	until we ended up in Israel.
783.26	"And only now,"" he says,"
785.26	"""I'm beginning to understand where I am,"
787.26	"and I actually like it."""
789.26	Now I remember, when he said it,
791.26	I felt goosebumps on my body,
793.26	because he said it overlooking the Moab Mountains here in the background.
796.26	That's where Joshua descended
798.26	and crossed the Jordan
800.26	and led the people of Israel into the land of Canaan
803.26	3,000 years ago
805.26	in this final leg
807.26	of the journey from Africa.
810.26	And so, perspective
812.26	and context and history
814.26	play key roles
816.26	in the way I plan my rides
818.26	with the kids.
820.26	We visit Kibbutzim
822.26	that were established by Holocaust survivors.
825.26	We explore ruins
828.26	of Palestinian villages,
831.26	and we discuss how they became ruins.
834.26	And we go through numerous remnants
837.26	of Jewish settlements, Nabatic settlements,
839.26	Canaanite settlements --
841.26	three-, four, five-thousand years old.
843.26	And through this tapestry,
845.26	which is the history of this country,
848.26	the kids acquire
850.26	what is probably the most important
852.26	value in education,
854.26	and that is the understanding that life is complex,
858.26	and there's no black and white.
861.26	And by appreciating complexity,
863.26	they become more tolerant,
865.26	and tolerance leads to hope.
869.26	I ride with these kids once a week,
871.26	every Tuesday.
873.26	Here's a picture I took last Tuesday -- less than a week ago --
876.26	and I ride with them tomorrow also.
878.26	In every one of these rides
881.26	I always end up standing in one of these incredible locations,
884.26	taking in this incredible landscape around me,
887.26	and I feel blessed and fortunate
889.26	that I'm alive,
891.26	and that I sense every fiber
893.26	in my aching body.
895.26	And I feel blessed and fortunate
897.26	that 15 years ago
899.26	I had the courage to resign
901.26	my tenured position at NYU
903.26	and return to my home country
905.26	where I can do these incredible rides
907.26	with this group of troubled kids
909.26	coming from Ethiopia
911.26	and Morocco and Russia.
914.26	And I feel blessed and fortunate
916.26	that every week, every Tuesday --
918.26	and actually every Friday also --
921.26	I can once again celebrate
924.26	in the marrow of my bones
927.26	the very essence of living in Israel on the edge.
930.26	Thank you.
932.26	(Applause)
