12.269	So recently,
14.374	some white guys and some black women
17.176	swapped Twitter avatars, or pictures online.
19.808	They didn't change their content,
21.093	they kept tweeting the same as usual,
22.904	but suddenly, the white guys noticed
25.702	they were getting called the n-word all the time
27.603	and they were getting the worst kind of online abuse,
30.331	whereas the black women all of a sudden
32.891	noticed things got a lot more pleasant for them.
35.962	Now, if you're my five-year-old,
37.897	your Internet consists mostly of puppies and fairies
41.13	and occasionally fairies riding puppies.
43.285	That's a thing. Google it.
46.03	But the rest of us know that the Internet
48.324	can be a really ugly place.
51.182	I'm not talking about the kind of colorful debates
54.157	that I think are healthy for our democracy.
56.445	I'm talking about nasty personal attacks.
59.823	Maybe it's happened to you, but it's at least
61.947	twice as likely to happen, and be worse,
64.738	if you're a woman, a person of color, or gay,
66.741	or more than one at the same time.
68.675	In fact, just as I was writing this talk,
71.364	I found a Twitter account called @SallyKohnSucks.
76.343	The bio says that I'm a
79.215	"""man-hater and a bull dyke and the only"
79.215	thing I've ever accomplished with my career
82.724	"is spreading my perverse sexuality."""
85.289	Which, incidentally, is only a third correct.
87.466	I mean, lies! (Laughter)
93	But seriously, we all say we hate this crap.
95.113	The question is whether you're willing to make
96.93	a personal sacrifice to change it.
100.118	I don't mean giving up the Internet.
101.98	I mean changing the way you click,
104.182	because clicking is a public act.
107.037	It's no longer the case
108.71	that a few powerful elites control all the media
111.121	and the rest of us are just passive receivers.
113.36	Increasingly, we're all the media.
116.172	I used to think, oh, okay, I get dressed up,
119.332	I put on a lot of makeup,
121.238	I go on television, I talk about the news.
123.116	That is a public act of making media.
126.457	And then I go home and I browse the web
128.516	and I'm reading Twitter,
129.652	and that's a private act of consuming media.
131.769	I mean, of course it is. I'm in my pajamas.
134.326	Wrong.
136.152	Everything we blog, everything we Tweet,
138.266	and everything we click
141.621	is a public act of making media.
144.937	We are the new editors.
146.481	We decide what gets attention
148.313	based on what we give our attention to.
151.11	That's how the media works now.
152.457	There's all these hidden algorithms that decide
154.87	what you see more of and what we all see more of
157.133	based on what you click on,
158.89	and that in turn shapes our whole culture.
162.956	Over three out of five Americans think we have
164.911	a major incivility problem in our country right now,
168.901	but I'm going to guess that at least three out of five
170.635	Americans are clicking on the same insult-oriented,
174.655	rumor-mongering trash that feeds
176.803	the nastiest impulses in our society.
179.86	In an increasingly noisy media landscape,
183.833	the incentive is to make more noise to be heard,
187.213	and that tyranny of the loud
190.14	encourages the tyranny of the nasty.
193.477	It does not have to be that way.
196.395	It does not.
197.957	We can change the incentive.
200.832	For starters, there are two things we can all do.
202.452	First, don't just stand by the sidelines
202.452	when you see someone getting hurt.
206.385	If someone is being abused online, do something.
210.065	Be a hero. This is your chance.
212.194	Speak up. Speak out. Be a good person.
214.545	Drown out the negative with the positive.
216.841	And second, we've got to stop clicking
220.23	on the lowest-common-denominator, bottom-feeding
222.633	linkbait.
223.999	If you don't like the 24/7 all Kardashian
227.571	all the time programming,
229.253	you've got to stop clicking on the stories
231.127	about Kim Kardashian's sideboob.
235.07	I know you do it. (Applause)
237.874	You too, apparently.
239.814	I mean, really, same example:
240.939	if you don't like politicians calling each other names,
243.436	stop clicking on the stories
245.147	about what one guy in one party called
245.147	the other guy in the other party.
248.207	Clicking on a train wreck just pours gasoline on it.
250.998	It makes it worse, the fire spreads.
252.92	Our whole culture gets burned.
256.917	If what gets the most clicks wins,
260.05	then we have to start shaping the world we want
262.921	with our clicks,
264.89	because clicking is a public act.
268.776	So click responsibly. Thank you.
271.256	(Applause)
