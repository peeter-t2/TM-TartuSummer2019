12.717	I was on a long road trip this summer,
15.167	and I was having
15.167	a wonderful time listening
18.245	to the amazing Isabel Wilkerson's
18.245	"""The Warmth of Other Suns."""
22.992	It documents six million black folks
22.992	fleeing the South from 1915 to 1970
32.761	looking for a respite
32.761	from all the brutality
36.238	and trying to get to a better
36.238	opportunity up North,
39.999	and it was filled with stories
39.999	of the resilience and the brilliance
44.407	of African-Americans,
46.362	and it was also really hard to hear
46.362	all the stories of the horrors
56.32	It was especially hard to hear
56.32	about the beatings and the burnings
61.029	and the lynchings of black men.
63.366	"And I said, ""You know,"
63.366	this is a little deep.
66.632	I need a break. I'm going
66.632	"to turn on the radio."""
70.915	I turned it on, and there it was:
74.061	Ferguson, Missouri,
76.233	Michael Brown,
80.665	unarmed, shot by a white police officer,
80.665	laid on the ground dead,
86.564	blood running for four hours
90.478	while his grandmother and little children
90.478	and his neighbors watched in horror,
94.993	and I thought,
98.019	here it is again.
101.24	This violence, this brutality
101.24	against black men
104.962	has been going on for centuries.
107.824	I mean, it's the same story.
107.824	It's just different names.
112.396	It could have been Amadou Diallo.
116.498	It could have been Sean Bell.
118.823	It could have been Oscar Grant.
122.213	It could have been Trayvon Martin.
126.205	This violence, this brutality,
129.044	is really something that's part
129.044	of our national psyche.
131.863	It's part of our collective history.
134.632	What are we going to do about it?
139.447	You know that part of us that still
139.447	crosses the street,
144.672	locks the doors,
146.722	clutches the purses,
149.076	when we see young black men?
151.962	That part.
154.023	I mean, I know we're not
154.023	shooting people down in the street,
157.971	but I'm saying that the same
157.971	stereotypes and prejudices
162.058	that fuel those kinds of tragic incidents
165.123	are in us.
167.328	We've been schooled in them as well.
171.195	I believe that we can stop
171.195	these types of incidents,
177.758	these Fergusons from happening,
180.729	by looking within
180.729	and being willing to change ourselves.
186.078	So I have a call to action for you.
189.369	There are three things that I want
189.369	to offer us today to think about
193.454	as ways to stop Ferguson
193.454	from happening again;
198.562	three things that I think will help us
200.861	reform our images of young black men;
204.336	three things that I'm hoping
204.336	will not only protect them
208.652	but will open the world
208.652	so that they can thrive.
212.848	Can you imagine that?
215.149	Can you imagine our country
215.149	embracing young black men,
219.7	seeing them as part of our future,
219.7	giving them that kind of openness,
225.045	that kind of grace we give
225.045	to people we love?
228.758	How much better would our lives be?
228.758	How much better would our country be?
233.054	Let me just start with number one.
235.967	We gotta get out of denial.
240.956	Stop trying to be good people.
243.359	We need real people.
245.503	You know, I do a lot of diversity work,
247.412	and people will come up to me
247.412	at the beginning of the workshop.
250.382	"They're like, ""Oh, Ms. Diversity Lady,"
250.382	"we're so glad you're here"" --"
254.067	(Laughter) --
255.646	"""but we don't have a biased bone "
255.646	"in our body."""
258.659	"And I'm like, ""Really?"
260.522	Because I do this work every day,
260.522	"and I see all my biases."""
265.01	I mean, not too long ago, I was on a plane
268.525	and I heard the voice of a woman
268.525	pilot coming over the P.A. system,
272.902	and I was just so excited, so thrilled.
275.014	"I was like, ""Yes, women,"
275.014	we are rocking it.
278.116	"We are now in the stratosphere."""
280.326	It was all good, and then it started
280.326	getting turbulent and bumpy,
283.46	and I was like,
284.877	"""I hope she can drive."""
287.295	(Laughter)
288.634	I know. Right.
289.826	But it's not even like
289.826	I knew that was a bias
292.068	until I was coming back on the other leg
292.068	and there's always a guy driving
295.558	and it's often turbulent and bumpy,
297.307	and I've never questioned
297.307	the confidence of the male driver.
300.133	The pilot is good.
302.089	Now, here's the problem.
304.585	If you ask me explicitly,
304.585	"I would say, ""Female pilot: awesome."""
312.096	But it appears that when things get funky
312.096	and a little troublesome, a little risky,
316.792	I lean on a bias that I didn't
316.792	even know that I had.
320.802	You know, fast-moving planes in the sky,
323.416	I want a guy.
325.379	That's my default.
327.662	Men are my default.
330.291	Who is your default?
332.611	Who do you trust?
334.641	Who are you afraid of?
336.774	Who do you implicitly feel connected to?
340.805	Who do you run away from?
343.847	I'm going to tell you
343.847	what we have learned.
346.271	The implicit association test,
346.271	which measures unconscious bias,
351.669	you can go online and take it.
353.389	Five million people have taken it.
355.645	Turns out, our default is white.
355.645	We like white people.
361.555	We prefer white. What do I mean by that?
364.315	When people are shown images 
364.315	of black men and white men,
369.569	we are more quickly able to associate
373.562	that picture with a positive word,
373.562	that white person with a positive word,
377.64	than we are when we are 
377.64	trying to associate
380.305	positive with a black face,
380.305	and vice versa.
384.01	When we see a black face,
385.9	it is easier for us to connect
385.9	black with negative
391.948	than it is white with negative.
394.075	Seventy percent of white people
394.075	taking that test prefer white.
401.039	Fifty percent of black people
401.039	taking that test prefer white.
405.753	You see, we were all outside
405.753	when the contamination came down.
411.31	What do we do about the fact
411.31	that our brain automatically associates?
417.697	You know, one of the things
417.697	that you probably are thinking about,
423.306	and you're probably like, you know what,
425.284	I'm just going to double down
425.284	on my color blindness.
428.818	Yes, I'm going to recommit to that.
430.545	I'm going to suggest to you, no.
432.662	We've gone about as far as we can go
432.662	trying to make a difference
435.821	trying to not see color.
437.434	The problem was never that we saw color.
437.434	It was what we did when we saw the color.
442.269	It's a false ideal.
446.27	And while we're busy 
446.27	pretending not to see,
449.04	we are not being aware of the ways
449.04	in which racial difference
452.871	is changing people's possibilities,
452.871	that's keeping them from thriving,
458.152	and sometimes it's causing them
458.152	an early death.
463.339	So in fact, what the scientists
463.339	are telling us is, no way.
468.885	Don't even think about color blindness.
471.28	In fact, what they're suggesting is,
473.76	stare at awesome black people.
478.29	(Laughter)
480.03	Look at them directly in their faces
480.03	and memorize them,
484.997	because when we look
484.997	at awesome folks who are black,
489.663	it helps to dissociate
492.872	the association that happens
492.872	automatically in our brain.
498.405	Why do you think I'm showing you
498.405	these beautiful black men behind me?
503.827	There were so many, I had to cut them.
507.039	Okay, so here's the thing:
508.351	I'm trying to reset your automatic
508.351	associations about who black men are.
514.279	I'm trying to remind you
516.641	that young black men
516.641	grow up to be amazing human beings
521.665	who have changed our lives
521.665	and made them better.
527.371	So here's the thing.
529.89	The other possibility in science,
532.441	and it's only temporarily changing
532.441	our automatic assumptions,
535.365	but one thing we know
537.87	is that if you take a white person
537.87	who is odious that you know,
542.662	and stick it up next to a person of color,
545.672	a black person, who is fabulous,
548.131	then that sometimes actually
548.131	causes us to disassociate too.
551.637	So think Jeffrey Dahmer and Colin Powell.
556.851	Just stare at them, right? (Laughter)
559.359	But these are the things.
559.359	So go looking for your bias.
562.168	Please, please, just get out of denial
562.168	and go looking for disconfirming data
566.257	that will prove that in fact
566.257	your old stereotypes are wrong.
570.847	Okay, so that's number one: number two,
572.781	what I'm going to say is move toward
572.781	young black men instead of away from them.
577.466	It's not the hardest thing to do,
580.058	but it's also one of these things
583.928	where you have to be conscious 
583.928	and intentional about it.
586.604	You know, I was in a Wall Street area 
586.604	one time several years ago
589.712	when I was with a colleague of mine,
589.712	and she's really wonderful
593.094	and she does diversity work with me
593.094	and she's a woman of color, she's Korean.
596.734	And we were outside,
596.734	it was late at night,
598.684	and we were sort of wondering where
598.684	we were going, we were lost.
601.726	And I saw this person across the street,
601.726	"and I was thinking, ""Oh great, black guy."""
605.91	I was going toward him
605.91	without even thinking about it.
608.678	And she was like,
608.678	"""Oh, that's interesting."""
612.462	The guy across the street,
612.462	he was a black guy.
615.28	I think black guys generally
615.28	know where they're going.
618.939	I don't know why exactly I think that,
618.939	but that's what I think.
622.584	"So she was saying, ""Oh, you"
622.584	"were going, 'Yay, a black guy'?"""
627.925	"She said, ""I was going,"
627.925	"'Ooh, a black guy.'"""
630.989	Other direction. Same need,
630.989	same guy, same clothes,
634.385	same time, same street,
634.385	different reaction.
637.734	"And she said, ""I feel so bad."
637.734	I'm a diversity consultant.
640.463	I did the black guy thing.
640.463	"I'm a woman of color. Oh my God!"""
643.281	"And I said, ""You know what? Please."
643.281	"We really need to relax about this."""
647.055	I mean, you've got to realize
647.055	I go way back with black guys.
650.781	(Laughter)
653.527	My dad is a black guy.
653.527	You see what I'm saying?
656.763	"I've got a 6'5"" black guy son."
656.763	I was married to a black guy.
660.703	My black guy thing
660.703	is so wide and so deep
663.219	that I can pretty much sort
663.219	and figure out who that black guy is,
668.009	and he was my black guy.
669.959	"He said, ""Yes, ladies, I know"
669.959	"where you're going. I'll take you there."""
673.733	You know, biases are the stories
673.733	we make up about people
677.376	before we know who they actually are.
679.888	But how are we going to know who they are
682.62	when we've been told to avoid
682.62	and be afraid of them?
686.427	So I'm going to tell you
686.427	to walk toward your discomfort.
691.48	And I'm not asking you
691.48	to take any crazy risks.
694.517	I'm saying, just do an inventory,
699.417	expand your social
699.417	and professional circles.
703.309	Who's in your circle?
705.139	Who's missing?
707.635	How many authentic relationships
711.592	do you have with young black people,
711.592	folks, men, women?
718.062	Or any other major difference
718.062	from who you are
721.814	and how you roll, so to speak?
725.15	Because, you know what?
725.15	Just look around your periphery.
728.229	There may be somebody at work,
728.229	in your classroom,
730.532	in your house of worship, somewhere,
730.532	there's some black young guy there.
733.98	And you're nice. You say hi.
735.438	I'm saying go deeper, closer, further,
735.438	and build the kinds of relationships,
741.784	the kinds of friendships that actually
741.784	cause you to see the holistic person
747.064	and to really go against the stereotypes.
750.552	I know some of you are out there,
755.436	"""You have no idea how awkward I am."
757.408	Like, I don't think this
757.408	is going to work for me.
760.14	"I'm sure I'm going to blow this."""
761.876	Okay, maybe, but this thing is not 
761.876	about perfection. It's about connection.
767.835	And you're not going to get comfortable
767.835	before you get uncomfortable.
772.839	I mean, you just have to do it.
774.969	And young black men, what I'm saying is
777.316	if someone comes your way, genuinely
777.316	and authentically, take the invitation.
782.361	Not everyone is out to get you.
784.211	Go looking for those people
784.211	who can see your humanity.
788.691	You know, it's the empathy
788.691	and the compassion
792.199	that comes out of having relationships
792.199	with people who are different from you.
796.903	Something really powerful
796.903	and beautiful happens:
799.898	you start to realize that they are you,
802.414	that they are part of you,
802.414	that they are you in your family,
808.196	and then we cease to be bystanders
811.194	and we become actors,
811.194	we become advocates,
815.179	and we become allies.
817.677	So go away from your comfort
817.677	into a bigger, brighter thing,
823.148	because that is how we will stop
823.148	another Ferguson from happening.
828.14	That's how we create a community
830.37	where everybody, especially
830.37	young black men, can thrive.
833.382	So this last thing is going to be harder,
836.305	and I know it, but I'm just going
836.305	to put it out there anyway.
839.173	When we see something, we have to have
839.173	the courage to say something,
844.412	even to the people we love.
848.206	You know, it's holidays
848.206	and it's going to be a time
851.847	when we're sitting around the table
851.847	and having a good time.
855.279	Many of us, anyways, will be in holidays,
857.478	and you've got to listen to
857.478	the conversations around the table.
862.402	You start to say things like,
862.402	"""Grandma's a bigot."""
869.094	(Laughter)
870.924	"""Uncle Joe is racist."""
873.863	And you know, we love Grandma
873.863	and we love Uncle Joe. We do.
878.482	We know they're good people,
878.482	but what they're saying is wrong.
885.317	And we need to be able to say something,
885.317	because you know who else is at the table?
892.3	The children are at the table.
895.154	And we wonder why these biases don't die,
895.154	and move from generation to generation?
900.399	Because we're not saying anything.
903.65	"We've got to be willing to say, ""Grandma,"
903.65	"we don't call people that anymore."""
910.172	"""Uncle Joe, it isn't true"
910.172	that he deserved that.
915.383	"No one deserves that."""
918.319	And we've got to be willing
921.733	to not shelter our children
921.733	from the ugliness of racism
926.507	when black parents don't
926.507	have the luxury to do so,
929.819	especially those who have 
929.819	young black sons.
934.6	We've got to take 
934.6	our lovely darlings, our future,
937.981	and we've got to tell them we have 
937.981	an amazing country with incredible ideals,
945.783	we have worked incredibly hard,
945.783	and we have made some progress,
948.762	but we are not done.
951.932	We still have in us this old stuff
955.926	about superiority and it is causing us
958.967	to embed those further
958.967	into our institutions
962.439	and our society and generations,
964.418	and it is making for despair
968.027	and disparities and a devastating
968.027	devaluing of young black men.
975.151	We still struggle, you have to tell them,
977.612	with seeing both the color
980.39	and the character of young black men,
984.024	but that you, and you expect them,
987.857	to be part of the forces of change
987.857	in this society
992.371	that will stand against injustice
992.371	and is willing, above all other things,
998.939	to make a society where young black men 
998.939	can be seen for all of who they are.
1008.705	So many amazing black men,
1013.627	those who are the most amazing
1013.627	statesmen that have ever lived,
1021.959	brave soldiers,
1024.992	awesome, hardworking laborers.
1029.286	These are people who
1029.286	are powerful preachers.
1033.942	They are incredible scientists
1033.942	and artists and writers.
1039.537	They are dynamic comedians.
1043.512	They are doting grandpas,
1048.448	caring sons.
1051.48	They are strong fathers,
1056.237	and they are young men
1056.237	with dreams of their own.
1060.593	Thank you.
1064.15	(Applause)
