27	so I'm going to dive straight in, right at the point
29	where I get this thing to work.
31	Here we go. I'm going to talk about five different things.
33	I'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable.
36	I'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together,
38	and actually talk about this a bit more than we do.
40	I'm going to talk about feasibility as well, of course.
42	I'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic
44	about doing anything about aging.
46	And then I'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk
48	talking about, you know, how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong,
53	namely, by actually doing something about it.
55	I'm going to do that in two steps.
57	The first one I'm going to talk about is
59	how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension --
62	which I'm going to define as 30 years, applied to people
65	who are already in middle-age when you start --
67	to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging.
70	Namely, essentially an elimination of the relationship between
74	how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year --
76	or indeed, to get sick in the first place.
78	And of course, the last thing I'm going to talk about
80	is how to reach that intermediate step,
82	that point of maybe 30 years life extension.
85	So I'm going to start with why we should.
88	Now, I want to ask a question.
90	Hands up: anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria?
93	That was easy. OK.
94	OK. Hands up: anyone in the audience
96	who's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing?
99	OK. So we all think malaria is a bad thing.
101	That's very good news, because I thought that was what the answer would be.
103	Now the thing is, I would like to put it to you
105	that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing
108	is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging.
112	And here is that characteristic.
115	The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does.
120	Now, I like in an audience, in Britain especially,
122	to talk about the comparison with foxhunting,
124	which is something that was banned after a long struggle,
127	by the government not very many months ago.
130	I mean, I know I'm with a sympathetic audience here,
132	but, as we know, a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic.
135	And this is actually a rather good comparison, it seems to me.
138	"You know, a lot of people said, ""Well, you know,"
140	city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time.
145	It's a traditional part of the way of life,
147	and we should be allowed to carry on doing it.
149	"It's ecologically sound; it stops the population explosion of foxes."""
152	But ultimately, the government prevailed in the end,
154	because the majority of the British public,
155	and certainly the majority of members of Parliament,
157	came to the conclusion that it was really something
159	that should not be tolerated in a civilized society.
161	And I think that human aging shares
162	all of these characteristics in spades.
165	What part of this do people not understand?
167	It's not just about life, of course --
169	(Laughter) --
170	it's about healthy life, you know --
173	getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun,
176	whether or not dying may be fun.
178	So really, this is how I would like to describe it.
180	It's a global trance.
182	These are the sorts of unbelievable excuses
184	that people give for aging.
186	And, I mean, OK, I'm not actually saying
188	that these excuses are completely valueless.
190	There are some good points to be made here,
192	things that we ought to be thinking about, forward planning
195	so that nothing goes too -- well, so that we minimize
197	the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging.
200	But these are completely crazy, when you actually
203	remember your sense of proportion.
205	You know, these are arguments; these are things that
209	would be legitimate to be concerned about.
211	But the question is, are they so dangerous --
214	these risks of doing something about aging --
216	that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite,
220	namely, leaving aging as it is?
222	Are these so bad that they outweigh
224	condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death?
230	You know, if you haven't got an argument that's that strong,
232	then just don't waste my time, is what I say.
235	(Laughter)
236	Now, there is one argument
237	that some people do think really is that strong, and here it is.
239	People worry about overpopulation; they say,
241	"""Well, if we fix aging, no one's going to die to speak of,"
243	or at least the death toll is going to be much lower,
246	only from crossing St. Giles carelessly.
248	And therefore, we're not going to be able to have many kids,
250	"and kids are really important to most people."""
252	And that's true.
254	And you know, a lot of people try to fudge this question,
257	and give answers like this.
258	I don't agree with those answers. I think they basically don't work.
261	I think it's true, that we will face a dilemma in this respect.
264	We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate,
268	or a high death rate.
270	A high death rate will, of course, arise from simply rejecting these therapies,
273	in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids.
277	And, I say that that's fine --
279	the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice.
282	What's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future.
286	If we vacillate, hesitate,
288	and do not actually develop these therapies,
291	then we are condemning a whole cohort of people --
295	who would have been young enough and healthy enough
297	to benefit from those therapies, but will not be,
299	because we haven't developed them as quickly as we could --
301	we'll be denying those people an indefinite life span,
303	and I consider that that is immoral.
305	That's my answer to the overpopulation question.
308	Right. So the next thing is,
310	now why should we get a little bit more active on this?
312	And the fundamental answer is that
314	the pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks.
317	It's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging.
321	Aging is ghastly, but it's inevitable, so, you know,
325	we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds,
327	and it's rational to do anything that we might want to do, to do that.
331	Like, for example, making up these ridiculous reasons
334	why aging is actually a good thing after all.
336	But of course, that only works when we have both of these components.
340	And as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear --
343	and we might be in range of doing something about aging --
345	this becomes part of the problem.
347	This pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things.
351	And that's why we have to really talk about this a lot --
355	evangelize, I will go so far as to say, quite a lot --
357	in order to get people's attention, and make people realize
360	that they are in a trance in this regard.
362	So that's all I'm going to say about that.
364	I'm now going to talk about feasibility.
367	And the fundamental reason, I think, why we feel that aging is inevitable
371	is summed up in a definition of aging that I'm giving here.
374	A very simple definition.
375	Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place,
378	which is to say, metabolism.
380	This is not a completely tautological statement;
383	it's a reasonable statement.
384	Aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars,
388	and it also happens to us,
390	despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms,
393	because those self-repair mechanisms are not perfect.
395	So basically, metabolism, which is defined as
397	basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next,
400	has side effects.
402	Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology.
404	That's a fine definition. So we can put it this way:
406	we can say that, you know, we have this chain of events.
408	And there are really two games in town,
410	according to most people, with regard to postponing aging.
413	"They're what I'm calling here the ""gerontology approach"" and the ""geriatrics approach."""
417	The geriatrician will intervene late in the day,
419	when pathology is becoming evident,
421	and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time,
424	and stop the accumulation of side effects
427	from causing the pathology quite so soon.
429	Of course, it's a very short-term-ist strategy; it's a losing battle,
432	because the things that are causing the pathology
435	are becoming more abundant as time goes on.
437	The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface,
441	because, you know, prevention is better than cure.
444	But unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well.
447	In fact, we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work --
450	even cells we're not really too good on yet.
452	We've discovered things like, for example,
454	RNA interference only a few years ago,
457	and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work.
459	Basically, gerontology is a fine approach in the end,
462	but it is not an approach whose time has come
464	when we're talking about intervention.
466	So then, what do we do about that?
469	I mean, that's a fine logic, that sounds pretty convincing,
471	pretty ironclad, doesn't it?
473	But it isn't.
475	Before I tell you why it isn't, I'm going to go a little bit
478	into what I'm calling step two.
480	Just suppose, as I said, that we do acquire --
484	let's say we do it today for the sake of argument --
486	the ability to confer 30 extra years of healthy life
490	on people who are already in middle age, let's say 55.
493	"I'm going to call that ""robust human rejuvenation."" OK."
496	What would that actually mean
497	for how long people of various ages today --
500	or equivalently, of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive --
504	would actually live?
506	In order to answer that question -- you might think it's simple,
508	but it's not simple.
509	"We can't just say, ""Well, if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies,"
512	"then they'll live 30 years longer."""
513	That's the wrong answer.
515	And the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progress.
517	There are two sorts of technological progress really,
519	for this purpose.
520	There are fundamental, major breakthroughs,
523	and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs.
527	Now, they differ a great deal
529	in terms of the predictability of time frames.
532	Fundamental breakthroughs:
533	very hard to predict how long it's going to take
535	to make a fundamental breakthrough.
536	It was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun,
539	and it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it.
542	But after that, things were pretty steady and pretty uniform.
546	I think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened
549	in the progression of the technology of powered flight.
553	We can think, really, that each one is sort of
557	beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one, if you like.
560	The incremental advances have added up to something
564	which is not incremental anymore.
566	This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough.
569	And you see it in all sorts of technologies.
571	Computers: you can look at a more or less parallel time line,
574	happening of course a bit later.
575	You can look at medical care. I mean, hygiene, vaccines, antibiotics --
578	you know, the same sort of time frame.
580	So I think that actually step two, that I called a step a moment ago,
584	isn't a step at all.
585	That in fact, the people who are young enough
588	to benefit from these first therapies
590	that give this moderate amount of life extension,
592	even though those people are already middle-aged when the therapies arrive,
596	will be at some sort of cusp.
598	They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments
602	that will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years.
604	In other words, they will be staying ahead of the game.
607	The therapies will be improving faster than
610	the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us.
614	This is a very important point for me to get across.
616	Because, you know, most people, when they hear
618	that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more,
623	they think that I'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades
627	that are so thoroughly eliminating aging
630	that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more.
633	I'm not saying that at all.
635	I'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies
637	will be enough.
638	They'll never be perfect, but we'll be able to fix the things
641	that 200-year-olds die of, before we have any 200-year-olds.
644	And the same for 300 and 400 and so on.
646	I decided to give this a little name,
649	"which is ""longevity escape velocity."""
651	(Laughter)
653	Well, it seems to get the point across.
656	So, these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live,
661	in terms of remaining life expectancy,
663	as measured by their health,
665	for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive.
668	If you're already 100, or even if you're 80 --
670	and an average 80-year-old,
672	we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies,
674	because you're too close to death's door
676	for the really initial, experimental therapies to be good enough for you.
680	You won't be able to withstand them.
681	But if you're only 50, then there's a chance
683	that you might be able to pull out of the dive and, you know --
686	(Laughter) --
687	eventually get through this
690	and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense,
693	in terms of your youthfulness, both physical and mental,
695	and in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes.
697	And of course, if you're a bit younger than that,
699	then you're never really even going
701	to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes.
704	So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to, that the first 150-year-old --
709	we don't know how old that person is today,
711	because we don't know how long it's going to take
713	to get these first-generation therapies.
715	But irrespective of that age,
717	I'm claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 --
721	subject of course, to, you know, global catastrophes --
724	is actually, probably, only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old.
728	And that's quite a thought.
730	Alright, so finally I'm going to spend the rest of the talk,
733	my last seven-and-a-half minutes, on step one;
736	namely, how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension
741	that will allow us to get to escape velocity?
744	And in order to do that, I need to talk about mice a little bit.
748	I have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation.
751	"I'm calling it ""robust mouse rejuvenation,"" not very imaginatively."
754	And this is what it is.
756	I say we're going to take a long-lived strain of mouse,
758	which basically means mice that live about three years on average.
761	We do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old.
764	And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them,
766	and with those therapies, we get them to live,
768	on average, to their fifth birthday.
770	So, in other words, we add two years --
772	we treble their remaining lifespan,
774	starting from the point that we started the therapies.
776	The question then is, what would that actually mean for the time frame
779	until we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans?
782	Which we can now, as I've explained,
784	equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity.
788	Secondly, what does it mean for the public's perception
791	of how long it's going to take for us to get to those things,
793	starting from the time we get the mice?
795	And thirdly, the question is, what will it do
797	to actually how much people want it?
799	And it seems to me that the first question
801	is entirely a biology question,
802	and it's extremely hard to answer.
804	One has to be very speculative,
806	and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation,
809	that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more.
813	I say that's nonsense.
814	I say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this.
817	We need to give our best guess as to the time frame,
820	in order to give people a sense of proportion
823	so that they can assess their priorities.
825	So, I say that we have a 50/50 chance
828	of reaching this RHR milestone,
830	robust human rejuvenation, within 15 years from the point
833	that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation.
838	The public's perception will probably be somewhat better than that.
841	The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are.
843	So they'll probably think it's five years away.
845	They'll be wrong, but that actually won't matter too much.
847	And finally, of course, I think it's fair to say
850	that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now
854	is the global trance I spoke about earlier, the coping strategy.
856	That will be history at this point,
858	because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans,
861	since it's been postponed so very effectively in mice.
864	So we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes,
868	and of course that has enormous implications.
871	So in order to tell you now how we're going to get these mice,
874	I'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging.
876	"I'm going to use this word ""damage"""
878	to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism
882	and that eventually cause pathology.
884	Because the critical thing about this
886	is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology,
888	the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life, starting before we're born.
893	But it is not part of metabolism itself.
896	And this turns out to be useful.
897	Because we can re-draw our original diagram this way.
900	We can say that, fundamentally, the difference between gerontology and geriatrics
903	is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate
905	at which metabolism lays down this damage.
907	And I'm going to explain exactly what damage is
909	in concrete biological terms in a moment.
912	And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time
914	by stopping the damage converting into pathology.
916	And the reason it's a losing battle
918	is because the damage is continuing to accumulate.
920	So there's a third approach, if we look at it this way.
923	"We can call it the ""engineering approach,"""
925	and I claim that the engineering approach is within range.
928	The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes.
931	It does not intervene in this process or this one.
933	And that's good because it means that it's not a losing battle,
936	and it's something that we are within range of being able to do,
939	because it doesn't involve improving on evolution.
942	The engineering approach simply says,
944	"""Let's go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage --"
948	not necessarily repair them completely, but repair them quite a lot,
952	so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold
955	"that must exist, that causes it to be pathogenic."""
958	We know that this threshold exists,
960	because we don't get age-related diseases until we're in middle age,
963	even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born.
966	Why do I say that we're in range? Well, this is basically it.
970	The point about this slide is actually the bottom.
973	If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging,
976	we will be here all night, because basically all of metabolism
979	is important for aging in one way or another.
981	This list is just for illustration; it is incomplete.
984	The list on the right is also incomplete.
986	It's a list of types of pathology that are age-related,
989	and it's just an incomplete list.
991	But I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete --
994	this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage,
997	side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end,
1000	or that might cause pathology.
1002	And there are only seven of them.
1005	They're categories of things, of course, but there's only seven of them.
1008	Cell loss, mutations in chromosomes, mutations in the mitochondria and so on.
1013	First of all, I'd like to give you an argument for why that list is complete.
1018	Of course one can make a biological argument.
1020	"One can say, ""OK, what are we made of?"""
1022	We're made of cells and stuff between cells.
1024	What can damage accumulate in?
1027	The answer is: long-lived molecules,
1029	because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage, but then the molecule is destroyed --
1032	like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis -- then the damage is gone, too.
1036	It's got to be long-lived molecules.
1038	So, these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago
1041	and that is pretty good news, because it means that,
1045	you know, we've come a long way in biology in these 20 years,
1047	so the fact that we haven't extended this list
1049	is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done.
1053	However, it's better than that; we actually know how to fix them all,
1055	in mice, in principle -- and what I mean by in principle is,
1058	we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade.
1061	Some of them are partially implemented already, the ones at the top.
1065	I haven't got time to go through them at all, but
1068	my conclusion is that, if we can actually get suitable funding for this,
1072	then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years,
1076	but we do need to get serious about it.
1079	We do need to really start trying.
1081	So of course, there are some biologists in the audience,
1084	and I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have.
1087	You may have been dissatisfied with this talk,
1089	but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff.
1091	I've published a great deal on this;
1093	I cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based,
1096	and there's quite a lot of detail there.
1098	The detail is what makes me confident
1100	of my rather aggressive time frames that I'm predicting here.
1102	So if you think that I'm wrong,
1104	you'd better damn well go and find out why you think I'm wrong.
1108	And of course the main thing is that you shouldn't trust people
1111	who call themselves gerontologists because,
1113	as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field,
1117	you know, you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant
1121	and not really to take it seriously.
1123	So, you know, you've got to actually do your homework,
1125	in order to understand whether this is true.
1126	And we'll just end with a few things.
1128	One thing is, you know, you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session
1131	who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time,
1135	"and everyone said, ""Well, it's obviously impossible."""
1137	And you know what happened.
1138	So, you know, this does happen.
1142	We have various strategies -- there's the Methuselah Mouse Prize,
1144	which is basically an incentive to innovate,
1147	and to do what you think is going to work,
1150	and you get money for it if you win.
1153	There's a proposal to actually put together an institute.
1156	This is what's going to take a bit of money.
1158	But, I mean, look -- how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq?
1161	Not very long. OK.
1162	(Laughter)
1163	It's got to be philanthropic, because profits distract biotech,
1166	but it's basically got a 90 percent chance, I think, of succeeding in this.
1170	And I think we know how to do it. And I'll stop there.
1173	Thank you.
1174	(Applause)
1179	Chris Anderson: OK. I don't know if there's going to be any questions
1182	but I thought I would give people the chance.
1184	Audience: Since you've been talking about aging and trying to defeat it,
1188	why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man?
1192	(Laughter)
1196	AG: Because I am an old man. I am actually 158.
1199	(Laughter)
1200	(Applause)
1203	Audience: Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems
1207	to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate.
1211	However, as far as I know, all the species have evolved to actually die,
1216	so when cells divide, the telomerase get shorter, and eventually species die.
1221	So, why does -- evolution has -- seems to have selected against immortality,
1226	when it is so advantageous, or is evolution just incomplete?
1230	AG: Brilliant. Thank you for asking a question
1232	that I can answer with an uncontroversial answer.
1234	I'm going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question,
1237	which I happen to agree with,
1239	which is that, no, aging is not a product of selection, evolution;
1242	[aging] is simply a product of evolutionary neglect.
1245	In other words, we have aging because it's hard work not to have aging;
1250	you need more genetic pathways, more sophistication in your genes
1252	in order to age more slowly,
1254	and that carries on being true the longer you push it out.
1257	So, to the extent that evolution doesn't matter,
1262	doesn't care whether genes are passed on by individuals,
1264	living a long time or by procreation,
1267	there's a certain amount of modulation of that,
1269	which is why different species have different lifespans,
1272	but that's why there are no immortal species.
1275	CA: The genes don't care but we do?
1277	AG: That's right.
1279	Audience: Hello. I read somewhere that in the last 20 years,
1284	the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years.
1289	If I project that, that would make me think
1292	that I would live until 120 if I don't crash on my motorbike.
1297	That means that I'm one of your subjects to become a 1,000-year-old?
1302	AG: If you lose a bit of weight.
1304	(Laughter)
1307	Your numbers are a bit out.
1310	The standard numbers are that lifespans
1313	have been growing at between one and two years per decade.
1316	So, it's not quite as good as you might think, you might hope.
1320	But I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible.
1323	Audience: I was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults
1326	are actually in the human embryo,
1328	and that the brain cells last 80 years or so.
1330	If that is indeed true,
1332	biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation?
1335	If there are cells in my body that live all 80 years,
1338	as opposed to a typical, you know, couple of months?
1340	AG: There are technical implications certainly.
1342	Basically what we need to do is replace cells
1346	in those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate,
1349	especially neurons, but we don't want to replace them
1352	any faster than that -- or not much faster anyway,
1354	because replacing them too fast would degrade cognitive function.
1358	What I said about there being no non-aging species earlier on
1361	was a little bit of an oversimplification.
1363	There are species that have no aging -- Hydra for example --
1367	but they do it by not having a nervous system --
1369	and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function
1371	on very long-lived cells.
