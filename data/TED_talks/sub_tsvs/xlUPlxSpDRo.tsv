12.66	I want to introduce you to some
12.66	very wise kids that I've known,
17.3	but first I want
17.3	to introduce you to a camel.
20.54	This is Cassie, a therapy camel
20.54	visiting one of our young patients
24.82	in her room,
26.74	which is pretty magical.
29.7	A friend of mine raises camels
29.7	at his ranch in the Santa Cruz Mountains.
34.86	He has about eight of them,
36.54	and he started 30 years ago
38.26	because he thought
38.26	horses were too mundane.
41.22	John is an out-of-the-box thinker,
44.62	which explains why the two of us
44.62	have been such good friends
47.46	all of our lives.
50.02	Over the years, I've convinced him
50.02	to shuttle those sweet furry beasts
55.18	up to hang out with our sick kids
55.18	from time to time.
59.26	Talking to John, I was surprised to learn
61.7	that camels have an average
61.7	life expectancy of 40 to 50 years.
67.42	The life expectancy of many
67.42	of the children with whom I work
70.94	is less than a year.
73.34	This is a picture
73.34	of the George Mark Children's House,
76.419	the first pediatric
76.419	palliative respite care center
79.94	to open in the United States.
82.22	I founded it in 2004,
85.22	after years of working as a psychologist
88.18	on pediatric intensive care units,
90.9	frustrated with the undignified deaths
90.9	that so many children experienced
95.94	and their families had to endure.
98.78	As I sat with families whose children
98.78	were at the end of their lives,
102.98	I was acutely aware of our surroundings.
106.66	While the elevated train
106.66	rumbled overhead on its track,
110.7	quite literally the room reverberated
110.7	with each passing train car.
116.3	The lights on the ward
116.3	were fluorescent and too bright.
119.7	Monitors beeped, as did the elevator,
122.94	noisily announcing its arrival.
125.7	These families were experiencing
127.7	some of the most excruciating
127.7	moments of their lives,
131.34	and I so wanted them
131.34	to have a more peaceful place
134.94	in which to say a last goodbye
134.94	to their young daughters and sons.
139.3	Surely, I thought,
141.78	there must be a better spot
141.78	than a hospital intensive care unit
145.42	for children at the end of their lives.
148.54	Our children's house
151.34	is calm and nurturing.
153.86	It's a place where families
153.86	can stay together
156.5	to enjoy quality time with their children,
159.1	many of whom are there for respite stays,
161.86	some with repeated visits
161.86	over a span of many years.
165.42	We call those kids our frequent flyers.
170.18	Rather than the bright,
170.18	noisy quarters of the hospital,
173.62	their rooms are calm and comfortable,
176.46	with actual living spaces
176.46	for the families,
179.74	a sanctuary of gardens
181.54	and a wonderful outdoor playground
184.06	with special structures
184.06	for children with physical limitations.
188.86	This sweet baby Lars
191.22	came to us directly
191.22	from a hospital intensive care unit.
196.26	Imagine hearing the heartbreaking news
199.42	that none of us would ever want to hear.
202.18	His parents had been told
202.18	that Lars had a brain anomaly
205.94	that would keep him from ever swallowing,
208.78	walking, talking
210.7	or developing mentally.
213.3	Recognizing what little chance
213.3	he had for survival,
216.3	his parents chose
216.3	to focus on the quality of time
219.38	that they could spend together.
221.42	They moved into
221.42	one of our family apartments
224.02	and treasured each day that they had,
226.46	which were far too few.
228.82	Lars's life was brief, to be sure,
231.7	mere weeks,
233.34	but it was calm and comfortable.
235.9	He went on hikes with his parents.
238.74	The time that he spent in the pool
238.74	with our aquatic therapist
241.74	lessened the seizures he was experiencing
243.94	and helped him to sleep at night.
246.14	His family had a peaceful place
248.22	in which to both celebrate his life
250.62	and mourn his death.
252.86	It has been five years
252.86	since Lars was with us,
256.1	and in that time,
258.02	his family has welcomed
260.38	a daughter and another son.
263.1	They are such a powerful testament
266.06	to the positive outcome that specialized
266.06	children's hospice care can create.
271.46	Their baby's physical discomfort
271.46	was well managed,
274.14	giving all of them the gift of time
274.14	to be together in a beautiful place.
280.1	I'm going to talk to you now
282.14	about the elephant
283.38	rather than the camel in the room.
287.26	Very few people want to talk about death,
290.42	and even fewer about children's death.
297.5	Loss of a child,
299.9	especially for those of us
299.9	who have our own children,
302.5	is frightening,
304.62	more than frightening,
306.66	paralyzing,
308.74	debilitating,
310.74	impossible.
313.14	But what I've learned is this:
315.42	children don't stop dying
317.46	just because we the adults
319.46	can't comprehend
319.46	the injustice of losing them.
322.82	And what's more,
325.34	if we can be brave enough
327.14	to face the possibility of death,
329.02	even among the most innocent,
331.94	we gain an unparalleled kind of wisdom.
336.06	Take Crystal, for example.
339.38	She was one of the first children
339.38	to come for care
341.78	after we opened our doors.
344.1	She was nine when she arrived,
345.78	and her neurologist expected
345.78	that she might live another two weeks.
350.14	She had an inoperable brain tumor,
352.66	and her decline had really accelerated
355.42	in the week before she came to us.
358.06	After settling into her room,
360.06	dressed entirely in pink and lavender,
363.82	surrounded by the Hello Kitty
363.82	accessories that she loved,
367.94	she spent the next several days
370.7	winning over the hearts
370.7	of every staff member.
374.58	Bit by bit, her condition stabilized,
377.78	and then to our astonishment,
380.22	she actually improved.
382.98	There were a variety of factors
384.66	that contributed to Crystal's improvement
388.26	which we later came to call
388.26	"the ""George Mark bump,"""
392.94	a lovely, not uncommon phenomenon
395.82	where children outlive
395.82	the prognoses of their illnesses
398.74	if they're outside of the hospital.
402.1	The calmer atmosphere of her surroundings,
406.34	tasty meals that were fixed
406.34	often to accommodate her requests,
411.18	the resident pets,
413.46	the therapy dog and rabbit
413.46	spent lots of cozy time with Crystal.
418.98	After she had been with us
418.98	for about a week,
421.94	she called her grandmother,
423.86	and she said,
425.3	"""Gee, I'm staying in a great big house,"
428.94	and there's room for you to come, too.
431.9	And guess what?
433.58	You don't have to bring any quarters
435.62	"because the washer and dryer are free."""
437.9	(Laughter)
440.1	Crystal's grandmother
440.1	soon arrived from out of town,
442.98	and they spent the remaining
442.98	four months of Crystal's life
447.54	enjoying very special days together.
450.02	Some days were special because Crystal
450.02	was outside in her wheelchair
454.02	sitting by the fountain.
455.86	For a little girl who had spent most
455.86	of the year earlier in a hospital bed,
460.26	being outside counting hummingbirds
463.22	made for an amazing time with her grandma,
465.58	and lots of laughter.
467.46	Other days were special
467.46	because of the activities
470.02	that our child life specialist
470.02	created for her.
473.66	Crystal strung beads and made jewelry
473.66	for everybody in the house.
477.86	She painted a pumpkin
477.86	to help decorate for Halloween.
482.18	She spent many excited days
482.18	planning her tenth birthday,
486.54	which of course none of us
486.54	thought she would ever see.
490.82	All of us wore pink boas for the occasion,
493.98	and Crystal, as you can see,
496.54	queen for a day,
497.78	wore a sparkly tiara.
500.46	One hot morning, I arrived at work
502.22	and Crystal and her partner
502.22	in crime, Charlie, greeted me.
507.74	With some help, they had set up
507.74	a lemonade and cookie stand
510.9	outside the front door,
512.82	a very strategic location.
517.14	I asked Crystal the price
517.14	of the cookie that I had selected,
520.54	"and she said, ""Three dollars."""
523.1	(Laughter)
526.979	I said that seemed a bit high
526.979	for one cookie.
530.1	(Laughter)
531.859	It was small.
535.14	"""I know,"" she acknowledged with a grin,"
537.86	"""but I'm worth it."""
540.82	And therein lie the words of wisdom
542.74	of a young girl whose brief life
542.74	forever impacted mine.
548.62	Crystal was worth it,
550.9	and shouldn't every child whose life
550.9	is shortened by a horrific illness
556.22	be worth it?
557.86	Together, all of us today
560.1	can offer that same specialized care
560.1	that Crystal received
563.38	by recognizing that children's
563.38	respite and hospice care
569.06	is a critical component missing
569.06	from our healthcare landscape.
575.375	It's also interesting to note
576.78	that we are able to provide this care
578.62	at about one third of the cost
578.62	of a hospital intensive care unit,
583.14	and our families don't see a bill.
586.7	We are ever grateful to the supporters
589.5	who believe in this important work
589.5	that we're doing.
593.82	The truth is that my colleagues and I
597.3	and the parents and other family members
600.9	who get to experience this special wisdom
603.9	are in a unique position.
606.7	There are only two freestanding
606.7	pediatric hospices in the United States,
611.94	although I'm happy to report
611.94	that based on our model,
614.66	there are 18 others
614.66	under various stages of development.
618.74	(Applause)
623.26	Still, most of the children
623.26	who die in the United States every year
628.3	die in hospital rooms,
630.34	surrounded by beeping machines
632.78	and anxious, exhausted adults
634.9	who have no other option
636.9	but to say goodbye
636.9	under those harsh, institutional lights
640.74	and among virtual strangers.
643.62	For comparison's sake,
645.78	the United Kingdom,
647.14	which is a country with about one fifth
647.14	the population of the United States,
651.3	and about half the size
651.3	of the state of California,
654.94	has 54 hospice and respite centers.
661.66	Why is that?
663.54	I've asked myself that question
663.54	obviously many times.
668.34	My best guess is that Americans,
668.34	with our positive can-do attitude
673.86	hold the expectation
673.86	that our medical care system will fix it,
678.46	even though it may be a childhood illness
678.46	for which there is no cure.
683.58	We go to extraordinary measures
683.58	to keep children alive
687.7	when in fact the greatest kindness
687.7	that we might give them
691.1	would be a peaceful, pain-free
693.86	end of life.
696.22	The transition from cure to care
699.06	remains a challenging one
699.06	for many hospital physicians
702.3	whose training has really been
702.3	about saving lives,
705.82	not about gently guiding the patient
705.82	to the end of life.
710.46	The dad of a sweet baby
710.46	for whom we cared at the end of her life
714.02	certainly captured this dichotomy
716.58	when he reflected
718.18	that there are a lot of people
718.18	to help you bring an infant into the world
722.18	but very few to help you usher a baby out.
726.94	So what is the magic ingredient
726.94	at George Mark?
730.98	The complex medical diagnoses
730.98	that bring our young patients to us
735.1	mean that their lives
735.1	have often been restricted,
738.1	some to a hospital bed
738.1	for long periods of time,
740.86	others to wheelchairs,
742.74	still others to intensive courses
742.74	of chemotherapy or rehab.
748.94	We make a practice
748.94	of ignoring those limitations.
752.66	"Our default answer is ""yes"""
754.9	"and our default question is, ""Why not?"""
758.3	That's why we took a young boy
760.14	who wasn't going to live
760.14	for another baseball season
763.14	to Game 5 of the World Series.
766.58	That's why we have a talent show
766.58	put on by the staff and kids
770.02	for family and friends.
771.66	Who wouldn't be enchanted by a young boy
771.66	playing a piano piece with his feet,
776.74	because his arms are atrophied?
779.62	That's why we have a prom every year.
783.62	It's pretty magical.
785.62	We started the prom
787.5	after hearing a dad lament
789.14	that he would never pin
789.14	a boutonniere on his son's tuxedo lapel.
795.3	The weeks before the dance,
797.46	the house is in a flurry,
798.74	and I don't know who's more excited,
798.74	the staff or the kids.
801.54	(Laughter)
802.7	The night of the event
804.34	involves rides in vintage cars,
808.82	a walk on a red carpet
810.82	into the great room,
813.34	a terrific DJ
815.98	and a photographer at the ready
817.78	to capture pictures of these attendees
820.34	and their families.
822.46	At the end of the evening this year,
824.78	one of our young,
824.78	delightful teenaged girls,
829.5	Caitlin, said to her mom,
833.46	"""That was the best night"
833.46	"of my whole life."""
836.3	And that's just the point,
838.7	to capture the best days and nights,
842.46	to abolish limitations,
845.34	"to have your default answer be ""yes"""
847.5	"and your default question be, ""Why not?"""
851.62	Ultimately life is too short,
854.14	whether we live
854.14	to be 85 years or just eight.
857.62	Trust me.
858.9	Better yet, trust Sam.
862.58	It's not by pretending
862.58	that death doesn't exist
866.7	that we keep the people,
868.54	especially the little people that we love,
870.98	safe.
872.9	In the end,
874.46	we can't control how long any of us lives.
877.7	What we can control
879.46	is how we spend our days,
882.1	the spaces we create,
884.94	the meaning and joy that we make.
888.74	We cannot change the outcome,
891.78	but we can change the journey.
895.5	Isn't it time
898.82	to recognize that children deserve
901.1	nothing less than our
901.1	most uncompromising bravery
905.5	and our wildest imagination.
908.86	Thank you.
910.1	(Applause)
