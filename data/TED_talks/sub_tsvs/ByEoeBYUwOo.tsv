13.48	I am holding something remarkably old.
16.44	It is older than any human artifact,
19.44	older than life on Earth,
21.76	older than the continents
21.76	and the oceans between them.
25.52	This was formed
25.52	over four billion years ago
28.64	in the earliest days of the solar system
30.8	while the planets were still forming.
33.16	This rusty lump of nickel and iron
33.16	may not appear special,
36.52	but when it is cut open ...
40.32	you can see that it is different
40.32	from earthly metals.
43.44	This pattern reveals metallic crystals
43.44	that can only form out in space
47.36	where molten metal
47.36	can cool extremely slowly,
49.96	a few degrees every million years.
52.76	This was once part
52.76	of a much larger object,
55.28	one of millions left over
55.28	after the planets formed.
57.88	We call these objects asteroids.
61.16	Asteroids are our oldest
61.16	and most numerous cosmic neighbors.
64.96	This graphic shows near-Earth asteroids
64.96	orbiting around the Sun,
68.04	shown in yellow,
69.32	and swinging close to the Earth's orbit,
71.28	shown in blue.
72.52	The sizes of the Earth, Sun and asteroids
72.52	have been greatly exaggerated
75.88	so you can see them clearly.
77.28	Teams of scientists across the globe
77.28	are searching for these objects,
80.68	discovering new ones every day,
82.64	steadily mapping near-Earth space.
85.44	Much of this work is funded by NASA.
87.76	I think of the search for these asteroids
87.76	as a giant public works project,
91.56	but instead of building a highway,
91.56	we're charting outer space,
94.84	building an archive
94.84	that will last for generations.
97.84	These are the 1,556 near-Earth asteroids
97.84	discovered just last year.
105.8	And these are all of the known
105.8	near-Earth asteroids,
109.36	which at last count was 13,733.
113.4	Each one has been imaged, cataloged
115.56	and had its path
115.56	around the Sun determined.
117.96	Although it varies
117.96	from asteroid to asteroid,
120.08	the paths of most asteroids
120.08	can be predicted for dozens of years.
123.36	And the paths of some asteroids can be
123.36	predicted with incredible precision.
127.16	For example, scientists
127.16	at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
129.84	predicted where the asteroid Toutatis
129.84	was going to be four years in advance
133.88	to within 30 kilometers.
136	In those four years,
137.32	Toutatis traveled 8.5 billion kilometers.
141.16	That's a fractional precision
142.759	of 0.000000004.
151.96	(Laughter)
154.48	Now, the reason I have
154.48	this beautiful asteroid fragment
157.16	is because, like all neighbors,
158.72	asteroids sometimes drop by unexpectedly.
161.4	(Laughter)
164.52	Three years ago today,
166.16	a small asteroid exploded
166.16	over the city of Chelyabinsk, Russia.
169.84	That object was about 19 meters across,
172.16	or about as big as a convenience store.
174.84	Objects of this size hit the Earth
174.84	every 50 years or so.
181.6	a much larger object hit the Earth,
183.56	causing a massive extinction.
	and animal species were lost,
188.6	including, sadly, the dinosaurs.
191.32	That object was
191.32	about 10 kilometers across,
194.04	and 10 kilometers is roughly
194.04	the cruising altitude of a 747 jet.
198.24	So the next time you're in an airplane,
200.16	snag a window seat, look out
200.16	and imagine a rock so enormous
204	that resting on the ground,
206.12	it just grazes your wingtip.
208.88	It's so wide that it takes your plane
208.88	one full minute to fly past it.
213.278	That's the size of the asteroid
213.278	that hit the Earth.
216.518	It has only been within my lifetime
218.318	that asteroids have been considered
218.318	a credible threat to our planet.
221.558	And since then, there's been
221.558	a focused effort underway
224.158	to discover and catalog these objects.
227.238	I am lucky enough
227.238	to be part of this effort.
229.358	I'm part of a team of scientists
229.358	that use NASA's NEOWISE telescope.
233.038	Now, NEOWISE was not
233.038	designed to find asteroids.
235.758	It was designed to orbit the earth
235.758	and look far beyond our solar system
239.998	to seek out the coldest stars
239.998	and the most luminous galaxies.
243.438	And it did that very well
243.438	for its designed lifetime of seven months.
247.518	But today, six years later,
247.518	it's still going.
250.798	We've repurposed it
250.798	to discover and study asteroids.
253.558	And although it's
253.558	a wonderful little space robot,
255.918	these days it's kind of like a used car.
258.518	The cryogen that used to refrigerate
258.518	its sensors is long gone,
261.798	so we joke that
261.798	its air-conditioning is broken.
264.478	It's got 920 million miles
264.478	on the odometer,
268.918	but it still runs great
270.198	and reliably takes a photograph
270.198	of the sky every 11 seconds.
273.798	It's taken 23 photos
273.798	since I began speaking to you.
278.118	One of the reasons NEOWISE is so valuable
280.318	is that it sees the sky
280.318	in the thermal infrared.
282.958	That means that instead of seeing
282.958	the sunlight that asteroids reflect,
286.318	NEOWISE sees the heat that they emit.
288.158	This is a vital capability
288.158	since some asteroids are as dark as coal
291.918	and can be difficult or impossible
291.918	to spot with other telescopes.
295.398	But all asteroids, light or dark,
295.398	shine brightly for NEOWISE.
300.958	Astronomers are using
300.958	every technique at their disposal
303.758	to discover and study asteroids.
306.078	In 2010, a historic milestone was reached.
308.958	The community, together, discovered
308.958	over 90 percent of asteroids
313.038	bigger than one kilometer across --
314.918	objects capable
314.918	of massive destruction to Earth.
317.918	But the job's not done yet.
319.518	An object 140 meters or bigger
319.518	could decimate a medium-sized country.
324.478	So far, we've only found
328.238	We must keep searching the sky
328.238	for near-Earth asteroids.
331.678	We are the only species
331.678	able to understand calculus
334.438	or build telescopes.
336.118	We know how to find these objects.
338.118	This is our responsibility.
340.278	If we found a hazardous asteroid
340.278	with significant early warning,
344.078	we could nudge it out of the way.
345.798	Unlike earthquakes, hurricanes
345.798	or volcanic eruptions,
348.878	an asteroid impact
348.878	can be precisely predicted
351.798	and prevented.
353.278	What we need to do now
353.278	is map near-Earth space.
356.438	We must keep searching the sky.
358.318	Thank you.
359.558	(Applause)
