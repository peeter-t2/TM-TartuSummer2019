12.765	I'm a little nervous, because my wife Yvonne said to me,
16.274	"she said, ""Geoff, you watch the TED Talks."""
18.443	"I said, ""Yes, honey, I love TED Talks."""
20.379	"She said, ""You know, they're like, really smart, talented -- """
23.867	"I said, ""I know, I know."" (Laughter)"
25.61	"She said, ""They don't want, like, the angry black man."""
30.402	(Laughter)
32.355	"So I said, ""No, I'm gonna be good, Honey,"
33.966	"I'm gonna be good. I am."""
36.021	But I am angry. (Laughter)
39.439	And the last time I looked, I'm --
43.145	(Applause)
45.952	So this is why I'm excited but I'm angry.
51.38	This year, there are going to be millions of our children
56.299	that we're going to needlessly lose,
59.263	that we could -- right now, we could save them all.
63.853	You saw the quality of the educators who were here.
67.698	Do not tell me they could not reach those kids
71.035	and save them. I know they could.
73.306	It is absolutely possible.
76.167	Why haven't we fixed this?
78.55	Those of us in education have held on to a business plan
83.314	that we don't care how many millions of young people fail,
87.169	we're going to continue to do the same thing that didn't work,
90.264	and nobody is getting crazy about it -- right? --
95.207	"enough to say, ""Enough is enough."""
97.352	So here's a business plan that simply does not make any sense.
101.736	You know, I grew up in the inner city,
105.096	and there were kids who were failing
109.983	in schools 56 years ago when I first went to school,
116.517	and those schools are still lousy today, 56 years later.
123.291	And you know something about a lousy school?
125.275	It's not like a bottle of wine.
127.891	Right? (Laughter)
129.202	Where you say, like, '87 was like a good year, right?
132.98	That's now how this thing -- I mean, every single year,
136.096	it's still the same approach, right?
138.502	One size fits all, if you get it, fine, and if you don't,
143.061	tough luck. Just tough luck.
146.721	Why haven't we allowed innovation to happen?
149.666	Do not tell me we can't do better than this.
152.131	Look, you go into a place that's failed kids for 50 years,
157.596	"and you say, ""So what's the plan?"""
160.06	"And they say, ""We'll, we're going to do"
162.164	"what we did last year this year."""
165.18	What kind of business model is that?
167.983	Banks used to open and operate between 10 and 3.
173.961	They operated 10 to 3. They were closed for lunch hour.
179.074	Now, who can bank between 10 and 3? The unemployed.
184.007	They don't need banks. They got no money in the banks.
187.395	Who created that business model? Right?
190.781	And it went on for decades.
192.894	You know why? Because they didn't care.
194.809	It wasn't about the customers.
196.793	It was about bankers. They created something that worked for them.
202.311	How could you go to the bank
204.39	when you were at work? It didn't matter.
206.799	And they don't care whether or not Geoff is upset
209.422	he can't go to the bank. Go find another bank.
212.011	They all operate the same way. Right?
215.449	Now, one day, some crazy banker had an idea.
219.312	Maybe we should keep the bank open when people come home from work.
223.289	They might like that. What about a Saturday?
226.416	What about introducing technology?
229.384	Now look, I'm a technology fan, but I have to admit
231.603	to you all I'm a little old.
233.944	So I was a little slow, and I did not trust technology,
236.897	and when they first came out with those new contraptions,
240.795	these tellers that you put in a card and they give you money,
244.465	"I was like, ""There's no way that machine is going to count that money right."
248.08	"I am never using that, right?"""
250.428	So technology has changed. Things have changed.
256.363	Yet not in education. Why?
259.049	Why is it that when we had rotary phones,
264.009	when we were having folks being crippled by polio,
268.32	that we were teaching
271.417	the same way then that we're doing right now?
273.672	And if you come up with a plan to change things,
278.08	people consider you radical.
280.341	They will say the worst things about you.
282.732	I said one day, well, look, if the science says --
286.624	this is science, not me -- that our poorest children
290.283	lose ground in the summertime --
293.593	You see where they are in June and say, okay, they're there.
295.695	You look at them in September, they've gone down.
298.372	You say, whoo! So I heard about that in '75
302.588	when I was at the Ed School at Harvard.
304.219	"I said, ""Oh, wow, this is an important study."""
307.109	Because it suggests we should do something.
311.119	(Laughter)
314.684	Every 10 years they reproduce the same study.
317.788	It says exactly the same thing:
319.411	Poor kids lose ground in the summertime.
321.677	The system decides you can't run schools in the summer.
326.51	You know, I always wonder, who makes up those rules?
329.736	For years I went to -- Look, I went the Harvard Ed School.
332.307	I thought I knew something.
333.415	They said it was the agrarian calendar, and people had —
336.496	but let me tell you why that doesn't make sense.
338.078	I never got that. I never got that,
341.36	because anyone knows if you farm,
343.512	you don't plant crops in July and August.
346.587	You plant them in the spring.
349.336	So who came up with this idea? Who owns it?
353.105	Why did we ever do it?
354.788	Well it just turns out in the 1840s we did have,
357.086	schools were open all year. They were open all year,
360.064	because we had a lot of folks who had to work all day.
363.088	They didn't have any place for their kids to go.
364.435	It was a perfect place to have schools.
366.469	So this is not something that is ordained
369.36	from the education gods.
372.354	So why don't we? Why don't we?
374.53	Because our business has refused to use science.
380.48	Science. You have Bill Gates coming out and saying,
383.492	"""Look, this works, right? We can do this."""
386.592	How many places in America are going to change? None.
391.741	None. Okay, yeah, there are two. All right?
394.453	Yes, there'll be some place, because some folks will do the right thing.
399.239	As a profession, we have to stop this. The science is clear.
403.784	Here's what we know.
406.079	We know that the problem begins immediately.
412.054	Right? This idea, zero to three.
415.963	My wife, Yvonne, and I, we have four kids,
418.449	three grown ones and a 15-year-old.
421.956	That's a longer story.
423.443	(Laughter)
425.092	With our first kids, we did not know the science
428.171	about brain development.
430.011	We didn't know how critical those first three years were.
432.625	We didn't know what was happening in those young brains.
435.039	We didn't know the role that language,
437.593	a stimulus and response, call and response,
440.484	how important that was in developing those children.
443.113	We know that now. What are we doing about it? Nothing.
447.978	Wealthy people know. Educated people know.
452.074	And their kids have an advantage.
453.744	Poor people don't know,
455.331	and we're not doing anything to help them at all.
458.335	But we know this is critical.
459.68	Now, you take pre-kindergarten.
463.41	We know it's important for kids.
465.48	Poor kids need that experience.
468.854	Nope. Lots of places, it doesn't exist.
473.783	We know health services matter.
476.331	You know, we provide health services
477.928	and people are always fussing at me about, you know,
480.867	because I'm all into accountability and data
484.782	and all of that good stuff, but we do health services,
487.976	and I have to raise a lot of money.
489.217	People used to say when they'd come fund us,
491.034	"""Geoff, why do you provide these health services?"""
493.813	I used to make stuff up. Right?
495.922	"I'd say, ""Well, you know a child"
498.473	who has cavities is not going to, uh,
502.226	"be able to study as well."""
504.286	And I had to because I had to raise the money.
508.291	But now I'm older, and you know what I tell them?
510.843	You know why I provide kids with those health benefits
513.585	and the sports and the recreation and the arts?
515.525	Because I actually like kids.
519.019	I actually like kids. (Laughter) (Applause)
524.38	But when they really get pushy, people really get pushy,
527.555	"I say, ""I do it because you do it for your kid."""
530.651	And you've never read a study from MIT that says
533.643	giving your kid dance instruction
536.619	is going to help them do algebra better,
539.536	but you will give that kid dance instruction,
541.611	and you will be thrilled that that kid wants to do dance instruction,
545.124	and it will make your day. And why shouldn't poor kids
548.445	have the same opportunity? It's the floor for these children.
553.999	(Applause)
556.701	So here's the other thing.
559.673	I'm a tester guy. I believe you need data, you need information,
563.54	because you work at something, you think it's working,
565.705	and you find out it's not working.
568.442	I mean, you're educators. You work, you say,
570.308	you think you've got it, great, no? And you find out they didn't get it.
573.353	But here's the problem with testing.
575.922	The testing that we do --
578.187	we're going to have our test in New York next week —
580.906	is in April.
582.861	You know when we're going to get the results back?
585.787	Maybe July, maybe June.
588.954	And the results have great data.
591.762	They'll tell you Raheem really struggled,
594.839	couldn't do two-digit multiplication -- so great data,
598.217	but you're getting it back after school is over.
600.746	And so, what do you do?
603.229	You go on vacation. (Laughter)
606.431	You come back from vacation.
607.766	Now you've got all of this test data from last year.
613.216	You don't look at it.
615.569	Why would you look at it?
617.832	You're going to go and teach this year.
619.991	So how much money did we just spend on all of that?
623.243	Billions and billions of dollars
626.246	for data that it's too late to use.
629.303	I need that data in September.
631.129	I need that data in November.
632.9	I need to know you're struggling, and I need to know
634.908	whether or not what I did corrected that.
637.293	I need to know that this week.
639.274	I don't need to know that at the end of the year when it's too late.
642.853	Because in my older years, I've become somewhat of a clairvoyant.
648.043	I can predict school scores.
651.266	You take me to any school.
653.311	I'm really good at inner city schools that are struggling.
656.369	And you tell me last year 48 percent of those kids
660.184	were on grade level.
662.791	"And I say, ""Okay, what's the plan, what did we do"
664.685	"from last year to this year?"""
665.634	"You say, ""We're doing the same thing."""
667.449	I'm going to make a prediction. (Laughter)
670.204	This year, somewhere between 44
673.37	and 52 percent of those kids will be on grade level.
676.265	And I will be right every single time.
679.84	So we're spending all of this money, but we're getting what?
684.229	Teachers need real information right now
686.821	about what's happening to their kids.
688.41	The high stakes is today, because you can do something about it.
693.803	So here's the other issue that I just think
698.637	we've got to be concerned about.
701.445	We can't stifle innovation in our business.
705.725	We have to innovate. And people in our business get mad about innovation.
709.618	They get angry if you do something different.
711.605	If you try something new, people are always like,
713.382	"""Ooh, charter schools."" Hey, let's try some stuff. Let's see."
717.879	This stuff hasn't worked for 55 years.
720.24	Let's try something different. And here's the rub.
723.311	Some of it's not going to work.
725.403	"You know, people tell me, ""Yeah, those charter schools, a lot of them don't work."""
728.141	A lot of them don't. They should be closed.
731.609	I mean, I really believe they should be closed.
733.515	But we can't confuse figuring out the science
737.824	and things not working with we shouldn't therefore do anything.
742.6	Right? Because that's not the way the world works.
744.502	If you think about technology,
746.008	imagine if that's how we thought about technology.
748.522	Every time something didn't work,
749.819	"we just threw in the towel and said, ""Let's forget it."" Right?"
752.365	You know, they convinced me. I'm sure some of you were like me --
755.534	the latest and greatest thing, the PalmPilot.
760.059	"They told me, ""Geoff, if you get this PalmPilot"
762.538	"you'll never need another thing."""
764.491	That thing lasted all of three weeks. It was over.
768.932	I was so disgusted I spent my money on this thing.
772.691	Did anybody stop inventing? Not a person. Not a soul.
778.608	The folks went out there. They kept inventing.
781.112	The fact that you have failure, that shouldn't stop you
784.222	from pushing the science forward.
787.108	Our job as educators,
789.28	there's some stuff we know that we can do.
791.745	And we've got to do better. The evaluation, we have to start with kids earlier,
795.724	we have to make sure that we provide the support to young people.
798.648	We've got to give them all of these opportunities.
801.056	So that we have to do. But this innovation issue,
804.372	this idea that we've got to keep innovating
808.164	until we really nail this science down
811.088	is something that is absolutely critical.
813.296	And this is something, by the way,
815.52	that I think is going to be a challenge for our entire field.
819.055	America cannot wait another 50 years to get this right.
824.334	We have run out of time.
827.003	I don't know about a fiscal cliff, but I know there's an educational cliff
830.091	that we are walking over right this very second,
833.544	and if we allow folks to continue this foolishness
837.984	about saying we can't afford this —
840.946	So Bill Gates says it's going to cost five billion dollars.
843.192	What is five billion dollars to the United States?
845.752	What did we spend in Afghanistan this year?
848.425	How many trillions? (Applause)
852.392	When the country cares about something,
855.416	we'll spend a trillion dollars without blinking an eye.
859.065	When the safety of America is threatened,
862.009	we will spend any amount of money.
864.88	The real safety of our nation
867.936	is preparing this next generation
870.313	so that they can take our place
872.552	and be the leaders of the world
876.739	when it comes to thinking and technology and democracy
879.936	and all that stuff we care about.
882.313	I dare say it's a pittance,
886.858	what it would require for us to really
890.543	begin to solve some of these problems.
892.791	So once we do that, I'll no longer be angry. (Laughter)
898.18	So, you guys, help me get there.
903.975	Thank you all very much. Thank you.
906.304	(Applause)
915.627	John Legend: So what is the high school dropout rate at Harlem Children's Zone?
919.835	Geoffrey Canada: Well, you know, John,
923.625	last year in my school.
924.776	A hundred percent of them went to college.
926.244	This year's seniors will have 100 percent graduating high school.
929.634	Last I heard we had 93 percent accepted to college.
932.696	We'd better get that other seven percent.
935.31	So that's just how this goes. (Applause)
942.005	JL: So how do you stick with them after they leave high school?
944.598	GC: Well, you know, one of the bad problems
947.187	we have in this country is these kids, the same kids,
949.629	these same vulnerable kids, when you get them in school,
951.558	they drop out in record numbers.
952.9	And so we've figured out that you've got to really design
956.565	a network of support for these kids that in many ways
959.989	mimics what a good parent does.
962.454	They harass you, right? They call you, they say,
965.551	"""I want to see your grades. How'd you do on that last test?"
967.662	What are you talking about that you want to leave school?
970.625	"And you're not coming back here."""
971.915	So a bunch of my kids know you can't come back to Harlem
974.17	because Geoff is looking for you.
975.501	"They're like, ""I really can't come back."" No. You'd better stay in school."
978.804	But I'm not kidding about some of this,
981.63	and it gets a little bit to the grit issue.
983.426	When kids know that you refuse to let them fail,
987.62	it puts a different pressure on them,
989.524	and they don't give up as easy.
991.212	So sometimes they don't have it inside,
993.654	"and they're, like, ""You know, I don't want to do this,"
995.7	"but I know my mother's going to be mad."""
999.053	Well, that matters to kids, and it helps get them through.
1001.782	We try to create a set of strategies that gets them tutoring
1005.591	and help and support, but also a set of encouragements
1009.526	"that say to them, ""You can do it. It is going to be hard,"
1012.136	"but we refuse to let you fail."""
1014.194	JL: Well, thank you Dr. Canada.
1015.774	Please give it up for him one more time.
1017.438	(Applause)
