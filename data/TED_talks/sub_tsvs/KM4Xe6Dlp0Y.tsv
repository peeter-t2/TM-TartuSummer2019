15.566	Hi. My name is Cameron Russell,
18.21	and for the last little while,
18.21	I've been a model.
24.263	Actually, for 10 years.
28.25	And I feel like
30.43	there's an uncomfortable tension
30.43	in the room right now
33.254	because I should not have worn this dress.
35.301	(Laughter)
37.083	So luckily, I brought an outfit change.
39.581	This is the first outfit change
39.581	on the TED stage,
43.23	so you guys are pretty lucky
43.23	to witness it, I think.
46.276	If some of the women were
46.276	really horrified when I came out,
49.217	you don't have to tell me now,
49.217	but I'll find out later on Twitter.
52.384	(Laughter)
57.575	I'd also note that I'm quite privileged
59.457	to be able to transform
59.457	what you think of me
62.535	in a very brief 10 seconds.
65.198	Not everybody gets to do that.
68.66	These heels are very uncomfortable,
68.66	so good thing I wasn't going to wear them.
74.499	The worst part is putting
74.499	this sweater over my head,
77.044	because that's when
77.044	you'll all laugh at me,
79.117	so don't do anything
79.117	while it's over my head.
83.005	All right.
86.243	So, why did I do that?
88.974	That was awkward.
90.204	(Laughter)
92.156	Well --
93.291	(Laughter)
95.681	Hopefully not as awkward as that picture.
100.566	Image is powerful,
103.348	but also, image is superficial.
108.296	I just totally transformed
108.296	what you thought of me, in six seconds.
112.739	And in this picture,
114.578	I had actually never had
114.578	a boyfriend in real life.
117.903	I was totally uncomfortable,
119.72	and the photographer
119.72	was telling me to arch my back
122.222	and put my hand in that guy's hair.
126.273	And of course, barring surgery,
128.273	or the fake tan that I got
128.273	two days ago for work,
131.714	there's very little that we can do
131.714	to transform how we look,
135.475	and how we look, though it is
135.475	superficial and immutable,
138.931	has a huge impact on our lives.
143.294	So today, for me, being
143.294	fearless means being honest.
147.922	And I am on this stage
147.922	because I am a model.
150.807	I am on this stage because
150.807	I am a pretty, white woman,
154.534	and in my industry,
154.534	we call that a sexy girl.
157.299	I'm going to answer the questions
157.299	that people always ask me,
160.17	but with an honest twist.
161.492	So the first question is,
161.492	how do you become a model?
164.394	"I always just say, ""Oh, I was scouted,"""
166.427	but that means nothing.
167.609	The real way that I became a model
170.714	is I won a genetic lottery,
170.714	and I am the recipient of a legacy,
174.201	and maybe you're wondering
174.201	what is a legacy.
176.321	Well, for the past few centuries
179.067	we have defined beauty
179.067	not just as health and youth
184.585	and symmetry that we're biologically
184.585	programmed to admire,
188.371	but also as tall, slender figures,
191.907	and femininity and white skin.
195.154	And this is a legacy
195.154	that was built for me,
197.226	and it's a legacy
197.226	that I've been cashing out on.
199.7	And I know there are
199.7	people in the audience
201.754	who are skeptical at this point,
203.47	and maybe there are
203.47	some fashionistas who are like,
205.971	"""Wait. Naomi. Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liu Wen."""
208.514	And first, I commend you on your model
208.514	knowledge. Very impressive.
211.681	(Laughter)
213.337	But unfortunately,
213.337	I have to inform you that in 2007,
216.89	a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student
219.4	counted all the models on the runway,
219.4	every single one that was hired,
223.026	and of the 677 models that were hired,
226.154	only 27, or less than four percent,
226.154	were non-white.
230.897	The next question people always ask is,
232.854	"""Can I be a model when I grow up?"""
234.503	"And the first answer is, ""I don't know,"
234.503	"they don't put me in charge of that."""
238.161	But the second answer,
239.578	and what I really want to say
239.578	to these little girls is,
242.356	"""Why? You know? You can be anything."
244.37	You could be the President
244.37	of the United States,
246.64	or the inventor of the next Internet,
248.441	or a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet,
250.423	which would be awesome,
250.423	"because you'd be the first one."""
253.114	(Laughter)
255.3	If, after this amazing list,
255.3	they still are like,
257.658	"""No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model,"""
259.587	"well, then I say, ""Be my boss."""
261.225	Because I'm not in charge of anything,
263.115	and you could be the editor in chief
263.115	of American Vogue
265.666	or the CEO of H&amp;M,
265.666	or the next Steven Meisel.
268.291	Saying that you want to be
268.291	a model when you grow up
270.696	is akin to saying that you want to win
270.696	the Powerball when you grow up.
274.054	It's out of your control,
274.054	and it's awesome,
277.498	and it's not a career path.
279.576	I will demonstrate for you now
283.567	because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons,
285.496	it can just be distilled right now.
288.222	So, if the photographer is right there,
291.306	the light is right there, like a nice HMI,
293.387	and the client says,
293.387	"""We want a walking shot,"""
295.558	this leg goes first, nice and long,
295.558	this arm goes back, this arm goes forward,
299.266	the head is at three quarters,
299.266	and you just go back and forth,
302.208	just do that, and then you look back
302.208	at your imaginary friends,
306.975	(Laughter)
308.679	It will look something like this.
310.49	(Laughter)
312.701	Hopefully less awkward
312.701	than that one in the middle.
315.653	That was -- I don't know
315.653	what happened there.
318.228	Unfortunately,
318.228	after you've gone to school,
320.359	and you have a résumé
320.359	and you've done a few jobs,
322.713	you can't say anything anymore,
324.229	so if you say you want to be
324.229	the President of the United States,
327.3	but your résumé reads,
327.3	"""Underwear Model: 10 years,"""
329.73	people give you a funny look.
331.16	The next question is,
331.16	"""Do they retouch all the photos?"""
333.772	And yeah, they pretty much
333.772	retouch all the photos,
336.177	but that is only a small component
336.177	of what's happening.
339.266	This picture is the very first
339.266	picture that I ever took,
342.008	and it's also the very first time
342.008	that I had worn a bikini,
344.841	and I didn't even have my period yet.
346.645	I know we're getting personal,
346.645	but I was a young girl.
349.796	This is what I looked like with my grandma
349.796	just a few months earlier.
354.276	Here's me on the same day as this shoot.
356.476	My friend got to come.
357.844	Here's me at a slumber party
357.844	a few days before I shot French Vogue.
361.939	Here's me on the soccer team
361.939	and in V Magazine.
366.047	And here's me today.
367.507	And I hope what you're seeing
369.567	is that these pictures
369.567	are not pictures of me.
371.765	They are constructions,
373.203	and they are constructions
373.203	by a group of professionals,
376.131	by hairstylists and makeup artists
376.131	and photographers and stylists
379.251	and all of their assistants
379.251	and pre-production and post-production,
382.467	and they build this.
383.499	That's not me.
384.593	Okay, so the next question
384.593	people always ask me is,
387.014	"""Do you get free stuff?"""
388.364	(Laughter)
389.434	I do have too many 8-inch heels
389.434	which I never get to wear,
392.705	except for earlier,
394.324	but the free stuff that I get
394.324	is the free stuff that I get in real life,
397.809	and that's what we don't like
397.809	to talk about.
400.063	I grew up in Cambridge,
401.354	and one time I went into a store
401.354	and I forgot my money
403.95	and they gave me the dress for free.
406.082	When I was a teenager,
406.082	I was driving with my friend
408.602	who was an awful driver
408.602	and she ran a red and of course,
411.293	we got pulled over,
412.506	"and all it took was a ""Sorry, officer,"""
412.506	and we were on our way.
417.623	And I got these free things
417.623	because of how I look,
420.829	not who I am, and there are
420.829	people paying a cost
423.648	for how they look and not who they are.
425.89	I live in New York, and last year,
427.534	of the 140,000 teenagers
427.534	that were stopped and frisked,
	and most of them were young men.
435.376	And there are only 177,000
435.376	young black and Latino men in New York,
439.862	so for them, it's not a question
439.862	"of, ""Will I get stopped?"""
442.601	"but ""How many times will I get stopped?"
442.601	"When will I get stopped?"""
445.683	When I was researching this talk,
447.279	I found out that of the 13-year-old girls
447.279	in the United States,
453.145	and that number goes to 78%
453.145	by the time that they're 17.
457.241	So, the last question people ask me is,
460.163	"""What is it like to be a model?"""
461.787	And I think the answer
461.787	that they're looking for is,
464.194	"""If you are a little bit skinnier"
464.194	and you have shinier hair,
467.138	"you will be so happy and fabulous."""
469.935	And when we're backstage,
471.494	we give an answer
471.494	that maybe makes it seem like that.
474.041	"We say, ""It's really amazing to travel,"
474.041	and it's amazing to get to work
477.545	with creative, inspired,
477.545	"passionate people."""
480.169	And those things are true,
480.169	but they're only one half of the story,
483.336	because the thing
483.336	that we never say on camera,
485.938	that I have never said on camera, is,
488.034	"""I am insecure."""
490.418	And I'm insecure because I have to think
490.418	about what I look like every day.
495.86	And if you ever are wondering,
498.856	"""If I have thinner thighs"
498.856	"and shinier hair, will I be happier?"""
502.81	you just need to meet a group of models,
504.739	because they have the thinnest thighs,
504.739	the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes,
508.689	and they're the most physically
508.689	insecure women probably on the planet.
512.156	When I was writing this talk,
513.562	I found it very difficult
513.562	to strike an honest balance,
516.555	because on the one hand,
518.013	I felt very uncomfortable
518.013	to come out here and say,
520.449	"""Look I've received all these benefits"
520.449	"from a deck stacked in my favor,"""
524.068	and it also felt really uncomfortable
524.068	to follow that up with,
527.283	"""and it doesn't always make me happy."""
529.671	But mostly it was difficult to unpack
529.671	a legacy of gender and racial oppression
535.57	when I am one
535.57	of the biggest beneficiaries.
539.082	But I'm also happy
539.082	and honored to be up here
541.563	and I think that it's great
541.563	that I got to come
544.799	before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed
544.799	and I'd had more agency in my career,
548.496	because maybe then I wouldn't tell
548.496	the story of how I got my first job,
551.994	or maybe I wouldn't tell the story
551.994	of how I paid for college,
554.891	which seems so important right now.
557.334	If there's a takeaway to this talk,
559.256	I hope it's that we all feel
559.256	more comfortable acknowledging
562.883	the power of image
562.883	in our perceived successes
566.85	and our perceived failures.
568.75	Thank you.
570.126	(Applause)
