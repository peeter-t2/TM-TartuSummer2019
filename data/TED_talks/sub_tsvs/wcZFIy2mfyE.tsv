26	I've got apparently 18 minutes
28	to convince you that history has a direction, an arrow;
31	that in some fundamental sense, it's good;
34	that the arrow points to something positive.
37	Now, when the TED people first approached me about giving this upbeat talk --
41	(Laughter)
42	-- that was before the cartoon of Muhammad had triggered global rioting.
48	It was before the avian flu had reached Europe.
50	It was before Hamas had won the Palestinian election,
52	eliciting various counter-measures by Israel.
56	And to be honest, if I had known when I was asked to give this upbeat talk
60	that even as I was giving the upbeat talk,
63	the apocalypse would be unfolding --
66	(Laughter)
67	"-- I might have said, ""Is it okay if I talk about something else?"""
71	But I didn't, OK. So we're here. I'll do what I can. I'll do what I can.
77	I've got to warn you:
79	the sense in which my worldview is upbeat has always been kind of subtle,
86	sometimes even elusive.
88	(Laughter)
89	The sense in which I can be uplifting and inspiring --
92	I mean, there's always been a kind of a certain grim dimension
95	to the way I try to uplift, so if grim inspiration --
99	(Laughter)
100	-- if grim inspiration is not a contradiction in terms, that is, I'm afraid,
104	the most you can hope for. OK, today -- that's if I succeed.
108	I'll see what I can do. OK?
110	Now, in one sense,
112	the claim that history has a direction is not that controversial.
115	If you're just talking about social structure,
118	OK, clearly that's gotten more complex
120	a little over the last 10,000 years -- has reached higher and higher levels.
123	And in fact, that's actually sustaining
125	a long-standing trend that predates human beings, OK,
129	that biological evolution was doing for us.
132	Because what happened in the beginning, this stuff encases itself in a cell,
137	then cells start hanging out together in societies.
140	Eventually they get so close, they form multicellular organisms,
143	then you get complex multicellular organisms; they form societies.
148	But then at some point, one of these multicellular organisms
151	does something completely amazing with this stuff, which is
154	it launches a whole second kind of evolution: cultural evolution.
159	And amazingly, that evolution sustains the trajectory
162	that biological evolution had established toward greater complexity.
167	By cultural evolution we mean the evolution of ideas.
170	"A lot of you have heard the term ""memes."" The evolution of technology,"
173	I pay a lot of attention to, so, you know,
175	one of the first things you got was a little hand axe.
179	Generations go by, somebody says, hey, why don't we put it on a stick?
184	(Laughter)
187	Just absolutely delights the little ones.
190	Next best thing to a video game.
192	This may not seem to impress,
194	but technological evolution is progressive, so another 10, 20,000 years,
198	and armaments technology takes you here.
200	(Laughter)
201	Impressive. And the rate of technological evolution speeds up,
205	so a mere quarter of a century after this, you get this, OK.
209	(Laughter)
211	And this.
213	(Laughter)
214	I'm sorry -- it was a cheap laugh, but I wanted to find a way
217	to transition back to this idea of the unfolding apocalypse,
220	and I thought that might do it.
222	(Applause)
229	So, what threatens to happen with this unfolding apocalypse
234	is the collapse of global social organization.
238	Now, first let me remind you how much work it took to get us where we are,
241	to be on the brink of true global social organization.
244	Originally, you had the most complex societies, the hunter-gatherer village.
250	Stonehenge is the remnant of a chiefdom,
252	which is what you get with the invention of agriculture: multi-village polity
255	with centralized rule.
258	With the invention of writing, you start getting cities. This is blurry. I kind of like that
263	because it makes it look like a one-celled organism and reminds you
266	how many levels organic organization has already moved through
270	to get to this point. And then you get to, you know, you get empires.
276	I want to stress, you know, social organization can transcend political bounds.
280	This is the Silk Road connecting the Chinese Empire and the Roman Empire.
284	So you had social complexity spanning the whole continent,
287	even if no polity did similarly. Today, you've got nation states.
292	Point is: there's obviously collaboration and organization going on
295	beyond national bounds.
297	This is actually just a picture of the earth at night,
300	and I'm just putting it up because I think it's pretty.
302	Does kind of convey the sense that this is an integrated system.
307	Now, I explained this growth of complexity by reference to something
313	"called ""non-zero sumness."""
317	Assuming that a few of you did not do the assigned reading, very quickly,
322	the key idea is the distinction between zero-sum games, in which correlations
327	are inverse: always a winner and a loser.
330	Non-zero-sum games in which correlations can be positive, OK.
334	So like in tennis, usually it's win-lose;
338	it always adds up to zero-zero-sum. But if you're playing doubles,
341	the person on your side of the net, they're in the same boat as you,
343	so you're playing a non-zero-sum game with them.
345	It's either for the better or for the worse, OK.
348	A lot of forms of non-zero-sum behavior in the realm of economics and so on
353	in everyday life often leads to cooperation.
357	The argument I make is basically that, well,
359	non-zero-sum games have always been part of life.
361	You have them in hunter-gatherer societies,
363	but then through technological evolution, new forms of technology arise
368	that facilitate or encourage the playing of non-zero-sum games,
373	involving more people over larger territory.
376	Social structure adapts to accommodate this possibility and
380	to harness this productive potential, so you get cities, you know,
383	and you get all the non-zero-sum games you don't think about
386	that are being played across the world.
387	Like, have you ever thought when you buy a car,
390	how many people on how many different continents contributed
392	to the manufacture of that car? Those are people in effect
397	you're playing a non-zero-sum game with.
399	I mean, there are certainly plenty of them around.
406	Now, this sounds like an intrinsically upbeat worldview in a way,
409	because when you think of non-zero, you think win-win, you know,
412	that's good. Well, there are a few reasons
414	that actually it's not intrinsically upbeat.
417	First of all, it can accommodate; it doesn't deny the existence
421	of inequality exploitation war.
424	But there's a more fundamental reason
426	that it's not intrinsically upbeat, because a non-zero-sum game,
429	all it tells you for sure is that the fortunes will be correlated for better or worse.
433	It doesn't necessarily predict a win-win outcome.
439	So, in a way, the question is: on what grounds
441	am I upbeat at all about history? And the answer is,
445	first of all, on balance I would say people have played their games
449	to more win-win outcomes than lose-lose outcomes. On balance,
453	I think history is a net positive in the non-zero-sum game department.
459	And a testament to this is the thing that most amazes me,
464	most impresses me, and most uplifts me,
466	which is that there is a moral dimension to history;
471	there is a moral arrow. We have seen moral progress over time.
474	2,500 years ago, members of one Greek city-state
478	considered members of another Greek city-state subhuman
481	and treated them that way. And then this moral revolution arrived,
486	and they decided that actually, no, Greeks are human beings.
490	It's just the Persians who aren't fully human
493	and don't deserve to be treated very nicely.
495	But this was progress -- you know, give them credit. And now today,
498	we've seen more progress. I think -- I hope -- most people here would say
501	that all people everywhere are human beings,
504	deserve to be treated decently,
507	unless they do something horrendous, regardless of race or religion.
511	And you have to read your ancient history to realize what a revolution that has been,
515	OK. This was not a prevalent view,
517	few thousand years ago, and I attribute it to this non-zero-sum dynamic.
522	I think that's the reason there is as much tolerance toward nationalities,
526	ethnicities, religions as there is today. If you asked me,
531	you know, why am I not in favor of bombing Japan,
533	well, I'm only half-joking when I say they built my car.
536	We have this non-zero-sum relationship,
538	and I think that does lead to a kind of a tolerance to the extent that you realize
544	that someone else's welfare is positively correlated with yours --
548	you're more likely to cut them a break.
550	I kind of think this is a kind of a business-class morality.
555	Unfortunately, I don't fly trans-Atlantic business class often enough
559	to know, or any other kind of business class really,
562	but I assume that in business class, you don't hear many expressions of, you know,
566	bigotry about racial groups or ethnic groups,
569	because the people who are flying trans-Atlantic business class
572	are doing business with all these people; they're making money
574	off all these people. And I really do think that, in that sense at least,
578	capitalism has been a constructive force,
581	and more fundamentally, it's a non-zero-sumness
583	that has been a constructive force in expanding people's realm
587	of moral awareness. I think the non-zero-sum dynamic,
592	which is not only economic by any means -- it's not always commerce --
596	but it has driven us to the verge of a moral truth,
601	which is the fundamental equality of everyone. It has done that.
604	As it has moved global, moved us toward a global level of social organization,
609	it has driven us toward moral truth.
611	I think that's wonderful.
614	Now, back to the unfolding apocalypse.
617	And you may wonder, OK, that's all fine,
619	sounds great -- moral direction in history --
621	but what about this so-called clash of civilizations? Well, first of all,
630	I would emphasize that it fits into the non-zero-sum framework,
633	OK. If you look at the relationship
635	between the so-called Muslim world and Western world --
638	two terms I don't like, but can't really avoid;
641	in such a short span of time, they're efficient if nothing else --
645	it is non-zero-sum. And by that I mean,
648	if people in the Muslim world get more hateful, more resentful,
652	less happy with their place in the world,
653	it'll be bad for the West. If they get more happy, it'll be good for the West.
657	So that is a non-zero-sum dynamic.
662	And I would say the non-zero-sum dynamic is only going to grow more intense over time
666	because of technological trends, but more intense in a kind of negative way.
671	It's the downside correlation of their fortunes that will become more and more possible.
677	"And one reason is because of something I call the ""growing lethality of hatred."""
682	More and more, it's possible for grassroots hatred abroad
686	to manifest itself in the form of organized violence on American soil.
691	And that's pretty new, and I think it's probably going to get a lot worse
694	-- this capacity -- because of
697	trends in information technology, in technologies that can be used
701	for purposes of munitions like biotechnology and nanotechnology.
707	We may be hearing more about that today.
709	And there's something I worry about especially, which is that
712	this dynamic will lead to a kind of a feedback cycle that puts us on a slippery slope.
718	What I have in mind is: terrorism happens here; we overreact to it.
721	That, you know, we're not sufficiently surgical in our retaliation
725	leads to more hatred abroad, more terrorism.
727	We overreact because being human, we feel like retaliating,
731	and it gets worse and worse and worse.
733	You could call this the positive feedback of negative vibes,
737	but I think in something so spooky,
739	we really shouldn't have the word positive there at all, even in a technical sense.
742	So let's call it the death spiral of negativity.
745	(Laughter)
747	I assure you if it happens, at the end, both the West
749	and the Muslim world will have suffered.
752	So, what do we do? Well, first of all, we can do a lot more with arms control,
758	the international regulation of dangerous technologies.
760	I have a whole global governance sermon
762	that I will spare you right now,
764	because I don't think that's going to be enough anyway, although it's essential.
767	I think we're going to have to have a major round
769	of moral progress in the world.
771	I think you're just going to have to see less hatred among groups,
776	less bigotry, and, you know, racial groups, religious groups, whatever.
782	I've got to admit I feel silly saying that.
784	It sounds so kind of Pollyannaish. I feel like Rodney King, you know,
787	saying, why can't we all just get along?
789	But hey, I don't really see any alternative, given the way I read the situation.
795	There's going to have to be moral progress.
798	There's going to have to be a lessening of the amount of hatred in the world,
802	given how dangerous it's becoming.
806	In my defense, I'd say, as naive as this may sound,
809	it's ultimately grounded in cynicism.
812	That is to say --
813	(Laughter)
814	-- thank you, thank you. That is to say, remember: my whole view
819	of morality is that it boils down to self-interest.
822	It's when people's fortunes are correlated.
824	It's when your welfare conduces to mine, that I decide, oh yeah,
827	I'm all in favor of your welfare. That's what's responsible
831	for this growth of this moral progress so far,
834	and I'm saying we once again have a correlation of fortunes,
837	and if people respond to it intelligently, we will see
841	the development of tolerance and so on --
844	the norms that we need, you know.
847	We will see the further evolution of this kind of business-class morality.
851	So, these two things, you know, if they get people's attention
857	and drive home the positive correlation and people do what's in their self-interests,
860	which is further the moral evolution,
864	then they could actually have a constructive effect.
867	And that's why I lump growing lethality of hatred
870	and death spiral of negativity under the general rubric,
873	reasons to be cheerful.
875	(Laughter)
877	Doing the best I can, OK.
879	(Laughter)
880	I never called myself Mr. Uplift.
882	I'm just doing what I can here.
885	(Laughter)
886	Now, launching a moral revolution has got to be hard, right?
889	I mean, what do you do?
891	And I think the answer is a lot of different people
893	are going to have to do a lot of different things.
896	We all start where we are. Speaking as an American
901	who has children whose security 10, 20, 30 years down the road
905	I worry about -- what I personally want to start out doing
908	is figuring out why so many people around the world hate us, OK.
912	I think that's a worthy research project myself.
916	I also like it because it's an intrinsically kind of morally redeeming exercise.
921	Because to understand why somebody
923	in a very different culture does something --
925	somebody you're kind of viewing as alien,
927	who's doing things you consider strange
929	in a culture you consider strange -- to really understand why they do
933	the things they do is a morally redeeming accomplishment,
937	because you've got to relate their experience to yours.
939	"To really understand it, you've got to say, ""Oh, I get it."
943	So when they feel resentful, it's kind of like
945	the way I feel resentful when this happens,
947	"and for somewhat the same reasons."" That's true understanding."
951	And I think that is an expansion of your moral compass when you manage to do that.
957	It's especially hard to do when people hate you, OK,
960	because you don't really, in a sense, want
963	to completely understand why people hate you.
965	I mean, you want to hear the reason, but you don't want to be able to relate to it.
967	You don't want it to make sense, right? (Laughter)
969	"You don't want to say, ""Well, yeah, I can kind of understand"
971	how a human being in those circumstances
973	"would hate the country I live in."" That's not a pleasant thing,"
976	but I think it's something that we're going to have to get used to and
982	work on. Now, I want to stress that to understand, you know --
993	there are people who don't like this whole business of understanding
996	the grassroots, the root causes of things; they don't want to know
1000	why people hate us. I want to understand it.
1003	The reason you're trying to understand why they hate us,
1005	is to get them to quit hating us. The idea
1008	when you go through this moral exercise of really coming to appreciate
1012	their humanity and better understand them, is part of an effort
1017	to get them to appreciate your humanity in the long run.
1019	I think it's the first step toward that. That's the long-term goal.
1023	There are people who worry about this, and in fact,
1028	I, myself, apparently, was denounced on national TV
1033	a couple of nights ago because of an op-ed I'd written.
1037	It was kind of along these lines, and the allegation was
1039	"that I have, quote, ""affection for terrorists."""
1043	Now, the good news is that the person who said it was Ann Coulter.
1046	(Laughter)
1048	(Applause)
1050	I mean, if you've got to have an enemy, do make it Ann Coulter.
1052	(Laughter)
1053	But it's not a crazy concern, OK, because understanding behavior
1057	can lead to a kind of empathy,
1059	and it can make it a little harder to deliver tough love, and so on.
1062	But I think we're a lot closer to erring on the side of not comprehending
1069	the situation clearly enough, than in comprehending it so clearly
1073	that we just can't, you know, get the army out to kill terrorists.
1076	So I'm not really worried about it. So --
1079	(Laughter)
1081	-- I mean, we're going to have to work on a lot of fronts,
1086	but if we succeed -- if we succeed -- then once again,
1093	non-zero-sumness and the recognition of non-zero-sum dynamics
1097	will have forced us to a higher moral level.
1101	And a kind of saving higher moral level,
1106	something that kind of literally saves the world.
1108	"If you look at the word ""salvation"" in the Bible --"
1111	the Christian usage that we're familiar with --
1114	saving souls, that people go to heaven -- that's actually a latecomer.
1117	"The original meaning of the word ""salvation"" in the Bible is about saving the social system."
1123	"""Yahweh is our Savior"" means ""He has saved the nation of Israel,"""
1126	which at the time, was a pretty high-level social organization.
1129	Now, social organization has reached the global level, and I guess,
1133	if there's good news I can say I'm bringing you, it's just that
1137	all the salvation of the world requires is the intelligent pursuit
1143	of self-interests in a disciplined and careful way.
1149	It's going to be hard. I say we give it a shot anyway
1152	because we've just come too far to screw it up now.
1155	Thanks.
1157	(Applause)
