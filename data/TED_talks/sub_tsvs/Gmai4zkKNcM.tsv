12.273	We are at a remarkable moment in time.
16.298	We face over the next two decades
19.234	two fundamental transformations
21.3	that will determine whether the next 100 years
24.342	is the best of centuries or the worst of centuries.
28.527	Let me illustrate with an example.
31.249	I first visited Beijing 25 years ago
34.523	to teach at the People's University of China.
37.549	China was getting serious about market economics
40.485	and about university education,
42.824	so they decided to call in the foreign experts.
47.315	Like most other people,
48.92	I moved around Beijing by bicycle.
51.736	Apart from dodging the occasional vehicle,
53.93	it was a safe and easy way to get around.
57.237	Cycling in Beijing now
58.601	is a completely different prospect.
61.422	The roads are jammed by cars and trucks.
64.565	The air is dangerously polluted
66.364	from the burning of coal and diesel.
69.976	When I was there last in the spring,
72.114	there was an advisory for people of my age —
74.892	over 65 —
77.322	to stay indoors and not move much.
80.191	How did this come about?
82.125	It came from the way in which
84.545	Beijing has grown as a city.
86.81	It's doubled over those 25 years, more than doubled,
89.27	from 10 million to 20 million.
91.446	It's become a sprawling urban area
93.139	dependent on dirty fuel, dirty energy,
97.498	particularly coal.
99.321	China burns half the world's coal each year,
103.596	and that's why, it is a key reason why,
107.51	it is the world's largest emitter
109.535	of greenhouse gases.
112.449	At the same time, we have to recognize
114.563	that in that period China has grown remarkably.
117.747	It has become the world's second largest economy.
120.188	Hundreds of millions of people
121.657	have been lifted out of poverty.
123.822	That's really important.
125.903	But at the same time, the people of China
128.22	are asking the question:
129.82	What's the value of this growth
131.4	if our cities are unlivable?
133.525	They've analyzed, diagnosed
135.837	that this is an unsustainable path of growth
139.177	and development.
141.303	China's planning to scale back coal.
143.632	It's looking to build its cities in different ways.
149.493	Now, the growth of China
151.326	is part of a dramatic change, fundamental change,
155.05	in the structure of the world economy.
157.817	Just 25 years ago, the developing countries,
160.539	the poorer countries of the world,
162.429	were, notwithstanding being
162.429	the vast majority of the people,
166.355	they accounted for only about a third
168.178	of the world's output.
170.17	Now it's more than half;
174.885	from the countries that we saw 25 years ago
177.99	as developing.
179.266	That's a remarkable change.
180.864	It means that most countries around the world,
183.266	rich or poor, are going to be facing
185.325	the two fundamental transformations
187.305	that I want to talk about and highlight.
190.49	Now, the first of these transformations
192.503	is the basic structural change
195.11	of the economies and societies
196.85	that I've already begun to illustrate
198.88	through the description of Beijing.
202.39	Fifty percent now in urban areas.
205.349	That's going to go to 70 percent in 2050.
208.96	Over the next two decades, we'll see
211.221	the demand for energy rise by 40 percent,
214.134	and the growth in the economy and in the population
218.108	is putting increasing pressure on our land,
221.09	on our water and on our forests.
224.956	This is profound structural change.
228.241	If we manage it in a negligent
229.816	or a shortsighted way,
232.435	we will create waste, pollution, congestion,
236.301	destruction of land and forests.
239.851	If we think of those three areas that I have illustrated
242.179	with my numbers — cities, energy, land —
245.902	if we manage all that badly,
247.781	then the outlook for the lives and livelihoods
249.862	of the people around the world
251.673	would be poor and damaged.
254.666	And more than that,
256.488	the emissions of greenhouse gases would rise,
259.796	with immense risks to our climate.
263.677	Concentrations of greenhouse gases
265.724	in the atmosphere are already
268.642	higher than they've been for millions of years.
272.276	If we go on increasing those concentrations,
275.914	we risk temperatures over the next century or so
279.288	that we have not seen on this planet
280.905	for tens of millions of years.
284.11	We've been around as Homo sapiens —
286.236	that's a rather generous definition, sapiens —
289.407	for perhaps a quarter of a million
289.407	years, a quarter of a million.
292.21	We risk temperatures we haven't seen
293.441	for tens of millions of years over a century.
298.18	That would transform the relationship
300.25	between human beings and the planet.
304.479	It would lead to changing deserts,
309.13	changing rivers, changing patterns of hurricanes,
312.32	changing sea levels,
313.558	hundreds of millions of people,
316.201	perhaps billions of people who would have to move,
319.43	and if we've learned anything from history,
321.353	that means severe and extended conflict.
323.665	And we couldn't just turn it off.
325.543	You can't make a peace treaty with the planet.
327.973	You can't negotiate with the laws of physics.
330.2	You're in there. You're stuck.
331.915	Those are the stakes we're playing for,
333.591	and that's why we have to make
333.591	this second transformation,
336.313	the climate transformation,
337.953	and move to a low-carbon economy.
340.336	Now, the first of these transformations
342.714	is going to happen anyway.
343.795	We have to decide whether to do it well or badly,
345.644	the economic, or structural, transformation.
348.462	But the second of the transformations,
350.352	the climate transformations, we have to decide to do.
354.466	Those two transformations face us
356.685	in the next two decades.
358.858	The next two decades are decisive
362.071	for what we have to do.
364.786	Now, the more I've thought about this,
366.305	the two transformations coming together,
368.409	the more I've come to realize
369.956	that this is an enormous opportunity.
372.908	It's an opportunity which we can use
375.135	or it's an opportunity which we can lose.
378.532	And let me explain through those three key areas
381.255	that I've identified: cities, energy and land.
383.965	And let me start with cities.
386.019	I've already described the problems of Beijing:
390.052	pollution, congestion, waste and so on.
392.898	Surely we recognize that in many of our cities
396.588	around the world.
397.847	Now, with cities, like life but particularly cities,
400.772	you have to think ahead.
403.836	The cities that are going to be built —
405.25	and there are many, and many big ones —
407.406	we have to think of how to design them
408.87	in a compact way
410.221	so we can save travel time 
410.221	and we can save energy.
413.664	The cities that already are 
413.664	there, well established,
417.579	we have to think about renewal
417.579	and investment in them
420.65	so that we can connect ourselves much better
423.428	within those cities, and make it easier,
425.82	encourage more people, to live closer to the center.
429.411	We've got examples building around the world
431.821	of the kinds of ways in which we can do that.
434.113	The bus rapid transport system in Bogotá in Colombia
438.131	is a very important case of how to move around
440.763	safely and quickly in a non-polluting way
443.333	in a city: very frequent buses,
446.528	strongly protected routes, the same service, really,
449.465	as an underground railway system,
451.556	but much, much cheaper
453.367	and can be done much more quickly,
455.775	a brilliant idea in many more cities
457.67	around the world that's developing.
459.706	Now, some things in cities do take time.
461.607	Some things in cities can happen much more quickly.
464.66	Take my hometown, London.
466.764	In 1952, smog in London killed 4,000 people
472.052	and badly damaged the lives of many, many more.
474.746	And it happened all the time.
476.096	For those of you live outside London in the U.K.
478.598	will remember it used to be called The Smoke.
480.791	That's the way London was.
482.467	By regulating coal, within a few years
484.549	the problems of smog were rapidly reduced.
487.637	I remember the smogs well.
489.192	When the visibility dropped to [less] than
491.915	a few meters,
493.908	they stopped the buses and I had to walk.
495.764	This was the 1950s.
497.822	I had to walk home three miles from school.
501.72	Again, breathing was a hazardous activity.
505.289	But it was changed. It was changed by a decision.
507.967	Good decisions can bring good results,
511.136	striking results, quickly.
513.501	We've seen more: In London, we've
513.501	introduced the congestion charge,
516.494	actually quite quickly and effectively,
519.2	and we've seen great improvements
520.82	in the bus system, and cleaned up the bus system.
524.782	You can see that the two
524.782	transformations I've described,
527.902	the structural and the climate,
529.858	come very much together.
532.49	But we have to invest. We have to invest in our cities,
535.423	and we have to invest wisely, and if we do,
537.956	we'll see cleaner cities, quieter cities, safer cities,
542.492	more attractive cities, more productive cities,
545.149	and stronger community in those cities —
547.916	public transport, recycling, reusing,
550.164	all sorts of things that bring communities together.
554.213	We can do that, but we have to think,
556.07	we have to invest, we have to plan.
558.35	Let me turn to energy.
560.521	Now, energy over the last 25 years
563.743	has increased by about 50 percent.
565.979	Eighty percent of that comes from fossil fuels.
568.596	Over the next 20 years,
570.254	perhaps it will increase by another 40 percent or so.
574.03	We have to invest strongly in energy,
576.564	we have to use it much more efficiently,
579.838	and we have to make it clean.
581.526	We can see how to do that.
582.856	Take the example of California.
584.76	It would be in the top 10 countries in the world
587.37	if it was independent.
589.913	I don't want to start any —
592.478	(Laughter)
595.976	California's a big place.
597.821	(Laughter)
599.869	In the next five or six years,
602.61	they will likely move from
605.324	around 20 percent in renewables —
607.563	wind, solar and so on —
609.32	to over 33 percent,
611.793	and that would bring California back
614.232	to greenhouse gas emissions in 2020
616.765	to where they were in 1990,
618.722	a period when the economy in California
620.466	would more or less have doubled.
621.898	That's a striking achievement.
623.348	It shows what can be done.
624.831	Not just California — the 
624.831	incoming government of India
628.138	is planning to get solar technology
631.164	to light up the homes
632.536	of 400 million people
634.246	who don't have electricity in India.
636.311	They've set themselves a target of five years.
638.791	I think they've got a good chance of doing that.
642.02	We'll see, but what you're seeing now
644.679	is people moving much more quickly.
646.99	Four hundred million, more than the population
648.724	of the United States.
650.85	Those are the kinds of ambitions now
652.943	people are setting themselves
654.649	in terms of rapidity of change.
659.129	Again, you can see
661.099	good decisions can bring quick results,
662.88	and those two transformations,
662.88	the economy and the structure
665.913	and the climate and the low carbon,
667.904	are intimately intertwined.
670.447	Do the first one well, the structural,
672.269	the second one on the climate
674.25	becomes much easier.
677.432	Look at land,
679.221	land and particularly forests.
681.809	Forests are the hosts to valuable
684.869	plant and animal species.
687.398	They hold water in the soil
689.746	and they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere,
692.664	fundamental to the tackling of climate change.
695.733	But we're losing our forests.
697.965	In the last decade, we've lost a forest area
700.792	the size of Portugal,
702.935	and much more has been degraded.
705.398	But we're already seeing
707.153	that we can do so much about that.
709.56	We can recognize the problem, but we can also
711.597	understand how to tackle it.
713.711	In Brazil, the rate of deforestation
716.366	has been reduced by 70 percent
718.383	over the last 10 years.
720.945	How? By involving local communities,
723.93	investing in their agriculture and their economies,
726.751	by monitoring more carefully,
728.851	by enforcing the law more strictly.
732.496	And it's not just stopping deforestation.
734.386	That's of course of first and fundamental importance,
736.827	but it's also regrading degraded land,
740.449	regenerating, rehabilitating degraded land.
744.849	I first went to Ethiopia in 1967.
748.729	It was desperately poor. In the following years,
751.204	it suffered devastating famines
752.95	and profoundly destructive social conflict.
756.806	Over the last few years, actually more than a few,
759.64	Ethiopia has been growing much more rapidly.
762.565	It has ambitions to be a middle-income country
766.96	and to be carbon neutral.
769.203	Again, I think it's a strong ambition
772.251	but it is a plausible one.
774.546	You're seeing that commitment there.
775.957	You're seeing what can be done.
777.223	Ethiopia is investing in clean energy.
779.788	It's working in the rehabilitation of land.
783.41	In Humbo, in southwest Ethiopia,
785.84	a wonderful project
787.257	to plant trees on degraded land
789.44	and work with local communities
791.06	on sustainable forest management
793.509	has led to big increases in living standards.
796.55	So we can see, from Beijing to London,
800.414	from California to India,
802.703	from Brazil to Ethiopia,
805.83	we do understand
807.439	how to manage those two transformations,
809.644	the structural and the climate.
811.573	We do understand how to manage those well.
815.752	And technology is changing very rapidly.
818.53	I don't have to list all those things
820.937	to an audience like this,
822.828	but you can see the electric cars,
825.122	you can see the batteries using new materials.
828.206	You can see that we can manage remotely now
830.601	our household appliances on our
830.601	mobile phones when we're away.
834.156	You can see better insulation.
835.963	And there's much more coming.
837.886	But, and it's a big but,
840.283	the world as a whole
841.892	is moving far too slowly.
844.67	We're not cutting emissions in the way we should.
847.212	We're not managing those structural transformations
849.923	as we can.
852.152	The depth of understanding of the
852.152	immense risks of climate change
855.391	are not there yet.
858.97	The depth of understanding
861.101	of the attractiveness of what we can do
863.586	is not there yet.
867.25	We need political pressure to build.
870.748	We need leaders to step up.
874.28	We can have better growth,
877.779	better climate, a better world.
881.986	We can make,
883.798	by managing those two transformations well,
886.578	the next 100 years the best of centuries.
890.866	If we make a mess of it,
892.093	we, you and me, if we make a mess of it,
895.24	if we don't manage those transformations properly,
897.713	it will be, the next 100 years
900.604	will be the worst of centuries.
903.335	That's the major conclusion
905.227	of the report on the economy and climate
908.358	chaired by ex-President Felipe Calderón of Mexico,
912.227	and I co-chaired that with him,
914.407	and we handed that report yesterday
916.36	here in New York, in the United Nations Building
919.35	to the Secretary-General of the U.N.,
920.822	Ban Ki-moon.
922.088	We know that we can do this.
926.193	Now, two weeks ago,
929.575	I became a grandfather for the fourth time.
932.975	Our daughter —
935.107	(Baby cries) (Laughter) (Applause) —
945.71	Our daughter gave birth to Rosa here in New York
948.621	two weeks ago. Here are Helen and Rosa.
951.626	(Applause)
958.87	Two weeks old.
961.838	Are we going to look our grandchildren in the eye
967.525	and tell them that we understood the issues,
971.272	that we recognized the dangers and the opportunities,
974.59	and still we failed to act?
978.831	Surely not. Let's make the next 100 years
982.31	the best of centuries.
984.116	(Applause)
