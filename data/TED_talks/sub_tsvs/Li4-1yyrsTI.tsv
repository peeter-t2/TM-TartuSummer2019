13.261	I want you to imagine
14.753	what a breakthrough this was
16.708	for women who were victims of violence
19.136	in the 1980s.
21.092	They would come into the emergency room
24.605	"with what the police would call ""a lovers' quarrel,"""
28.017	and I would see a woman who was beaten,
31.792	I would see a broken nose and a fractured wrist
36.534	and swollen eyes.
38.295	And as activists, we would take our Polaroid camera,
42.333	we would take her picture,
44.89	we would wait 90 seconds,
47.042	and we would give her the photograph.
50.169	And she would then have
52.063	the evidence she needed to go to court.
55.29	We were making what was invisible visible.
59.724	I've been doing this for 30 years.
61.695	I've been part of a social movement
63.858	that has been working on ending
65.821	violence against women and children.
69.928	And for all those years,
72.817	I've had an absolutely passionate
77.549	and sometimes not popular belief
80.496	that this violence is not inevitable,
83.79	that it is learned, and if it's learned,
86.795	it can be un-learned, and it can be prevented.
90.86	(Applause)
98.045	Why do I believe this?
100.008	Because it's true.
102.221	It is absolutely true.
104.458	Between 1993 and 2010,
110.014	domestic violence among adult women
113.347	in the United States
114.699	has gone down by 64 percent,
118.086	and that is great news.
120.763	(Applause)
123.512	Sixty-four percent. Now, how did we get there?
126.615	Our eyes were wide open.
128.41	Thirty years ago, women were beaten,
130.83	they were stalked, they were raped,
132.965	and no one talked about it.
135.506	There was no justice.
137.289	And as an activist, that was not good enough.
141.913	And so step one on this journey
144.384	is we organized,
146.381	and we created this extraordinary
149.015	underground network of amazing women
152.007	who opened shelters,
153.874	and if they didn't open a shelter,
155.993	they opened their home
157.585	so that women and children could be safe.
160.619	And you know what else we did?
162.299	We had bake sales, we had car washes,
165.764	and we did everything we could do to fundraise,
168.298	and then at one point we said,
170.275	you know, it's time that we went
172.416	to the federal government
174.07	and asked them to pay for these
176.041	extraordinary services that are saving people's lives.
180.056	Right? (Applause)
182.517	And so, step number two,
185.591	we knew we needed to change the laws.
187.936	And so we went to Washington,
190.223	and we lobbied for the first piece of legislation.
195.093	And I remember walking through the halls
197.854	of the U.S. Capitol,
200.264	and I was in my 30s, and my life had purpose,
204.622	and I couldn't imagine
206.728	that anybody would ever challenge
208.855	this important piece of legislation.
210.966	I was probably 30 and naive.
213.902	But I heard about a congressman
215.984	who had a very, very different point of view.
218.301	Do you know what he called
220.1	this important piece of legislation?
222.851	He called it the Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act.
226.338	The Take the Fun Out of Marriage Act.
228.517	Ladies and gentlemen, that was in 1984
230.98	in the United States, and I wish I had Twitter.
234.056	(Laughter)
237.243	Ten years later, after lots of hard work,
240.655	we finally passed the Violence Against Women Act,
243.732	which is a life-changing act
245.988	that has saved so many lives. (Applause)
248.842	Thank you.
250.272	I was proud to be part of that work,
253.163	and it changed the laws
255.613	and it put millions of dollars into local communities.
258.464	And you know what else it did? It collected data.
260.791	And I have to tell you, I'm passionate about data.
263.474	In fact, I am a data nerd.
266.056	I'm sure there are a lot of data nerds here.
268.084	I am a data nerd,
269.429	and the reason for that is I want to make sure
272.064	that if we spend a dollar, that the program works,
275.51	and if it doesn't work, we should change the plan.
279.974	And I also want to say one other thing:
283.573	We are not going to solve this problem
285.788	by building more jails
288.641	or by even building more shelters.
290.938	It is about economic empowerment for women,
294.131	it is about healing kids who are hurt,
296.876	and it is about prevention with a capital P.
300.336	And so, step number three on this journey:
304.73	We know, if we're going to
304.73	keep making this progress,
307.682	we're going to have to turn up the volume,
309.983	we're going to have to increase the visibility,
312.195	and we're going to have to engage the public.
315.107	And so knowing that, we went
315.107	to the Advertising Council,
318.517	and we asked them to help us
320.838	build a public education campaign.
323.428	And we looked around the world to Canada
325.884	and Australia and Brazil and parts of Africa,
328.526	and we took this knowledge
330.288	and we built the first national
332.781	public education campaign
334.872	called There's No Excuse for Domestic Violence.
337.442	Take a look at one of our spots.
339.641	(Video) Man: Where's dinner?
341.502	Woman: Well, I thought you'd be home a couple hours ago, and I put everything away, so—
345.014	Man: What is this? Pizza.
345.014	Woman: If you had just called me,
345.014	I would have known—
348.058	Man: Dinner? Dinner ready is a pizza?
348.058	Woman: Honey, please don't be so loud.
351.231	Please don't—Let go of me!
353.136	Man: Get in the kitchen!
353.136	Woman: No! Help!
356.03	Man: You want to see what hurts? (Slaps woman)
358.385	That's what hurts! That's what hurts!
358.385	(Breaking glass)
361.803	Woman: Help me!
364.044	"[""Children have to sit by and watch."
364.044	"What's your excuse?""]"
367.463	Esta Soler: As we were in the process
369.482	of releasing this campaign,
371.144	O.J. Simpson was arrested
373.327	for the murder of his wife and her friend.
377.461	We learned that he had a long history
379.564	of domestic violence.
380.937	The media became fixated.
383.463	The story of domestic violence
385.482	went from the back page,
386.836	but actually from the no-page, to the front page.
389.642	Our ads blanketed the airwaves,
392.596	and women, for the first time,
394.946	started to tell their stories.
397.067	Movements are about moments,
400.42	and we seized this moment.
403.014	And let me just put this in context.
405.353	Before 1980, do you have any idea
408.489	how many articles were in The New York Times
411.774	on domestic violence?
414.787	I'll tell you: 158.
418.451	And in the 2000s, over 7,000.
422.962	We were obviously making a difference.
425.997	But we were still missing a critical element.
428.743	So, step four: We needed to engage men.
434.258	We couldn't solve this problem
436.201	with 50 percent of the population on the sidelines.
439.318	And I already told you I'm a data nerd.
441.538	National polling told us that men felt indicted
445.161	and not invited into this conversation.
447.66	So we wondered, how can we include men?
451.376	How can we get men to talk about
453.495	violence against women and girls?
456.239	And a male friend of mine pulled me aside
458.893	"and he said, ""You want men to talk about violence"
462.269	"against women and girls. Men don't talk."""
465.186	(Laughter)
466.902	I apologize to the men in the audience.
469.178	I know you do.
470.652	"But he said, ""Do you know what they do do?"
472.706	They do talk to their kids.
474.385	"They talk to their kids as parents, as coaches."""
477.902	And that's what we did.
479.546	We met men where they were at
481.32	and we built a program.
482.859	And then we had this one event
484.638	that stays in my heart forever
486.713	where a basketball coach
489.298	was talking to a room filled with male athletes
493.22	and men from all walks of life.
495.801	And he was talking about the importance
497.704	of coaching boys into men
499.063	and changing the culture of the locker room
501.101	and giving men the tools to
501.101	have healthy relationships.
504.37	And all of a sudden, he looked
504.37	at the back of the room,
507.298	and he saw his daughter,
509.01	and he called out his daughter's name, Michaela,
511.572	"and he said, ""Michaela, come up here."""
513.431	And she's nine years old, and she was kind of shy,
515.638	and she got up there,
516.999	"and he said, ""Sit down next to me."""
519.605	She sat right down next to him.
521.728	He gave her this big hug, and he said,
524.536	"""People ask me why I do this work."
527.788	I do this work because I'm her dad,
530.535	"and I don't want anyone ever to hurt her."""
534.23	And as a parent, I get it.
537.582	I get it,
539.738	knowing that there are so many sexual assaults
542.621	on college campuses
544.489	that are so widespread and so under-reported.
548.029	We've done a lot for adult women.
550.134	We've got to do a better job for our kids.
553.201	We just do. We have to. (Applause)
556.391	We've come a long way
558.461	since the days of the Polaroid.
561.472	Technology has been our friend.
564.625	The mobile phone is a global game changer
568.684	for the empowerment of women,
570.647	and Facebook and Twitter and Google and YouTube
574.852	and all the social media helps us organize
578.657	and tell our story in a powerful way.
582.108	And so those of you in this audience
584.606	who have helped build those applications
586.447	and those platforms, as an organizer,
588.808	I say, thank you very much.
591.218	Really. I clap for you.
593.293	(Applause)
596.274	I'm the daughter of a man
599.021	who joined one club in his life,
601.292	the Optimist Club.
604.966	You can't make that one up.
607.728	And it is his spirit and his optimism
611.278	that is in my DNA.
613.188	I have been doing this work
615.05	for over 30 years,
617.204	and I am convinced, now more than ever,
619.901	in the capacity of human beings to change.
623.574	I believe we can bend the arc of human history
627.113	toward compassion and equality,
630.131	and I also fundamentally believe
632.949	and passionately believe
634.987	that this violence does not have to be part
638.117	of the human condition.
639.942	And I ask you, stand with us
643.295	as we create futures without violence
647.11	for women and girls and men and boys everywhere.
651.53	Thank you very much.
653.692	(Applause)
