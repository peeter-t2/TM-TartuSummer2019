12.644	I'm a historian.
13.819	Steve told us about the future
13.819	of little technology;
17.936	I'm going to show you some
17.936	of the past of big technology.
21.997	This was a project to build a 4,000-ton
21.997	nuclear bomb-propelled spaceship
27.457	and go to Saturn and Jupiter.
30.029	This took place in my childhood, 1957-65.
34.724	It was deeply classified.
36.027	I'm going to show you some stuff
36.027	that not only has not been declassified,
40.123	but has now been reclassified.
42.653	(Laughter)
46.369	If all goes well, next year I'll be back,
48.437	and I'll have a lot more to show you,
48.437	and if all doesn't go well,
51.592	I'll be in jail, like Wen Ho Lee.
53.911	(Laughter)
58.646	So, this ship was basically
58.646	the size of the Marriott Hotel,
62.453	a little taller and a little bigger.
64.76	And one of the people
64.76	who worked on it at the beginning
67.443	was my father, Freeman,
67.443	there in the middle.
69.535	That's me and my sister, Esther,
69.535	who's a frequent TEDster.
72.441	I didn't like nuclear
72.441	bomb-propelled spaceships.
75.627	I mean, I thought it was a great idea,
75.627	but I started building kayaks.
78.916	So we had a few kayaks.
80.104	Just so you know
80.104	that I am not Dr. Strangelove.
84.319	But all the time I was out there
84.319	doing these strange kayak voyages
87.533	in odd, beautiful parts of this planet,
90.427	I always thought in the back
90.427	of my mind about Project Orion,
93.76	and how my father and his friends
93.76	were going to build these big ships.
97.76	They were actually going to go --
99.827	Ted Taylor, who led the project,
99.827	was going to take his children.
102.888	My father was not going
102.888	to take his children,
105.039	that was one of the reasons we sort
105.039	of had a falling out for a few years.
108.702	(Laughter)
112.436	The project began in '57
112.436	at General Atomics there,
114.96	that's right on the coast at La Jolla.
116.926	Look at that central building
116.926	right in the middle of the picture.
120.023	That's the 130-foot diameter library.
123.383	That is exactly the size
123.383	of the base of the spaceship.
126.36	So put that library
126.36	at the bottom of that ship --
128.806	that's how big the thing was going to be.
130.799	It would take two or three thousand bombs.
132.869	The people who worked on it
132.869	were a lot of the Los Alamos people
135.87	who had done the hydrogen bomb work.
137.619	It was the first project funded by ARPA.
139.77	That's the contract where ARPA
139.77	gave the first million dollars
142.657	to get this thing started.
143.928	"""Spaceship project officially begun."
143.928	"Job waiting for you. Dyson."""
147.715	That's July '58.
149.16	Two days later, the space traveler's
149.16	manifesto explaining why --
153.418	just like we heard yesterday --
153.418	why we need to go into space:
156.32	"""... trips to satellites"
156.32	of the outer planets.
158.511	"August 20, 1958."""
160.255	These are the statistics of what would be
160.255	the good places to go and stop.
164.636	Some of the sizes of the ships,
166.149	ranging all the way up
166.149	to ship mass of 8 million tons.
170.355	So that was the outer extreme.
171.812	Here was version two: 2,000 bombs.
175.697	These are five-kiloton yield bombs,
175.697	about the size of small Volkswagens;
181.014	it would take 800 to get into orbit.
183.497	Here we see a 10,000-ton ship
183.497	will deliver 1,300 tons
187.941	to Saturn and back --
187.941	essentially, a five-year trip.
190.779	Possible departure dates:
190.779	October 1960 to February 1967.
195.684	These are trajectories going to Mars.
198.327	All this was done by hand,
198.327	with slide rules.
200.469	The little Orion ship,
202.057	and what it would take
202.057	to do what Orion does with chemicals:
204.933	you have a ship the size
204.933	of the Empire State Building.
207.494	NASA had no interest;
207.494	they tried to kill the project.
209.998	The people who supported it
209.998	were the Air Force,
212.221	which meant that it was all secret.
213.919	And that's why when you get something
213.919	declassified, that's what it looks like.
217.623	Military weapon versions
217.623	that carried hydrogen bombs
220.163	that could destroy half the planet.
221.868	There's another version there that sends
221.868	retaliatory strikes at the Soviet Union.
225.716	This is the really secret stuff:
227.272	how to get directed energy explosions.
229.408	So you're sending the energy
229.408	of a nuclear explosion --
231.981	not like just a stick of dynamite,
231.981	but you're directing it at the ship.
235.367	And this is still a very active subject.
237.655	It's quite dangerous,
238.885	but I believe it's better to have
238.885	dangerous things in the open
241.862	than think you're going
241.862	to keep them secret.
243.942	This is what happened
243.942	at 600 microseconds.
246.022	The Air Force started
246.022	to build smaller models
248.821	and actually started doing this.
250.539	The guys in La Jolla said,
250.539	"""We've got to get started now."""
253.286	They built a high-explosive
253.286	propelled model.
255.71	These are stills from
255.71	film footage that was saved
259.456	by someone who was supposed
259.456	to destroy it but didn't,
262.035	and kept it in their basement
262.035	for the last 40 years.
264.497	So, these are three-pound charges of C4;
266.437	that's about 10 times
266.437	what the guy had in his shoes.
269.134	(Laughter)
270.338	This is Ed Day putting --
271.784	So each of these coffee cans
271.784	has three pounds of C4 in it.
275.057	They're building a system that ejects
275.057	these at quarter-second intervals.
279.217	That's my dad in the sport coat there,
279.217	holding the briefcase.
282.519	So, they had a lot of fun doing this.
284.671	But no children were allowed;
286.18	my dad could tell me he was building
286.18	a spaceship and going to go to Saturn,
289.807	but he could not say
289.807	anything more about it.
291.949	So all my life I have wanted
291.949	to find this stuff out,
294.581	and spent the last four years
294.581	tracking these old guys down.
297.557	These are stills from the video.
299.108	Jeff Bezos kindly, yesterday,
299.108	said he'll put this video up
301.911	on the Amazon site --
301.911	some little clip of it.
304.327	(Applause)
305.359	So, thanks to him.
306.64	They got quite serious
306.64	about the engineering of this.
309.26	The size of that mass, for us,
311.305	is really large technology in a way
311.305	we're never going to go back to.
315.257	If you saw the 1959 --
317.035	this is what it would feel
317.035	like in the passenger compartment;
319.919	that's acceleration profile.
321.316	(Laughter)
322.348	And pulse-system yield:
322.348	we're looking at 20-kiloton yield
326.225	for an effective thrust
326.225	of 10 million newtons.
328.56	Well, here we have a little problem,
328.56	the radiation doses at the crew station:
334.992	(Laughter)
336.723	Fission yields during development:
338.5	they were hoping to get
338.5	clean bombs; they didn't.
341.83	Eyeburn: this is what happens
341.83	to the people in Miami who are looking up.
346.11	(Laughter)
347.558	Personnel compartment noise: that's
347.558	not too bad; it's very low frequencies,
351.137	it's basically like these sub-woofers.
352.979	And now we have ground-hazard assessments
352.979	when you have a blow-up on the pad.
356.637	Finally, at the very end in 1964,
356.637	NASA steps in and says,
359.589	"""OK, we'll support a feasibility study"
359.589	for a small version
363.182	that could be launched with Saturn Vs
363.182	"in sections and pieced together."""
367.306	So this is what NASA did,
369.355	getting an eight-man version
369.355	that would go to Mars.
374.33	They liked it because the guys could
374.33	kind of live there and be like,
377.55	"""It's like living in a submarine."""
379.2	This is crew compartment.
380.486	It switches, so what's
380.486	upside down is right side up
382.893	when you go to artificial gravity mode.
384.78	The scientists were still
384.78	going to go along;
386.866	they would take seven astronauts
386.866	and seven scientists.
389.415	This is a 20-man version
389.415	for going to Jupiter:
391.591	bunks, storm cellars, exercise room.
393.387	You know, it was going
393.387	to be a nice, long trip.
396.058	The Air Force version:
396.058	here we have a military version.
400.271	This is the kind of stuff
400.271	that's not been declassified,
402.885	just that people managed to sneak
402.885	home and after, you know,
405.687	on their deathbed,
405.687	basically, gave me that.
409.234	The sort of artist conceptions.
410.756	These are basically
410.756	PowerPoint presentations
412.962	given to the Air Force 40 years ago.
415.047	Look at the little guys there
415.047	outside the vehicle.
419.712	And one part of NASA was interested in it,
422.704	but the headquarters in NASA,
422.704	they killed the project.
426.828	So finally, at the end,
429.234	we can see the thing followed
429.234	its sort of design path right up to 1965,
434.475	and then all those paths came to a halt.
436.45	Results: none.
437.935	This project is hereby terminated.
439.963	So that's the end.
441.865	All I can say in closing is:
443.49	we heard yesterday that one of the 10
443.49	bad things that could happen to us
447.817	is an asteroid with our name on it.
450.431	And one of the bad things
450.431	that could happen to NASA
452.844	is if that asteroid shows up
452.844	with our name on it nine months out,
455.983	and everybody says,
457.602	"""Well, what are we going to do?"""
459.179	And Orion is really one
459.179	of the only, if not the only,
462.146	off-the-shelf technologies
462.146	that could do something.
466.251	(Laughter)
468.126	So I'm going to tell you
468.126	the good news and the bad news.
470.784	The good news is that NASA has a small,
470.784	secret contingency-plan division
476.559	that is looking at this, trying
476.559	to keep knowledge of Orion preserved
481.122	in the event of such a misfortune.
483.194	Maybe keep a few little
483.194	bombs of plutonium on the side.
486.226	That's the good news.
487.401	The bad news is, when I got
487.401	in contact with these people
490.052	to try and get some documents
490.052	from them, they went crazy
493.163	because I had all this stuff
493.163	that they don't have,
495.534	and NASA purchased 1,759 pages
495.534	of this stuff from me.
500.603	So that's the state we're at;
500.603	it's not very good.
503.31	(Laughter)
504.596	(Applause)
