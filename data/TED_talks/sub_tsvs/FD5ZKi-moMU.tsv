16.177	Well when I was asked to do this TEDTalk, I was really chuckled,
18.54	because, you see, my father's name was Ted,
22.333	and much of my life, especially my musical life,
26.347	is really a talk that I'm still having with him,
29.468	or the part of me that he continues to be.
33.216	Now Ted was a New Yorker, an all-around theater guy,
36.82	and he was a self-taught illustrator and musician.
41.135	He didn't read a note,
42.67	and he was profoundly hearing impaired.
45.635	Yet, he was my greatest teacher.
48.893	Because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids,
52.33	his understanding of music was profound.
55.51	And for him, it wasn't so much the way the music goes
58.891	as about what it witnesses and where it can take you.
63.087	And he did a painting of this experience,
65.704	"which he called ""In the Realm of Music."""
68.793	Now Ted entered this realm every day by improvising
75.281	in a sort of Tin Pan Alley style like this.
78.062	(Music)
84.904	But he was tough when it came to music.
88.258	"He said, ""There are only two things that matter in music:"
90.964	what and how.
93.177	And the thing about classical music,
96.964	"that what and how, it's inexhaustible."""
100.292	That was his passion for the music.
102.46	Both my parents really loved it.
104.317	They didn't know all that much about it,
106.575	but they gave me the opportunity to discover it
110.302	together with them.
112.218	And I think inspired by that memory,
115.43	it's been my desire to try and bring it
117.433	to as many other people as I can,
118.478	sort of pass it on through whatever means.
122.052	And how people get this music, how it comes into their lives,
127.062	really fascinates me.
128.518	One day in New York, I was on the street
130.775	and I saw some kids playing baseball between stoops and cars and fire hydrants.
136.18	And a tough, slouchy kid got up to bat,
138.881	and he took a swing and really connected.
141.585	And he watched the ball fly for a second,
143.287	"and then he went, ""Dah dadaratatatah."
146.691	"Brah dada dadadadah."""
150.177	And he ran around the bases.
152.01	And I thought, go figure.
154.745	How did this piece of 18th century Austrian aristocratic entertainment
159.826	turn into the victory crow of this New York kid?
164.498	How was that passed on? How did he get to hear Mozart?
168.9	Well when it comes to classical music,
170.821	there's an awful lot to pass on,
173.077	much more than Mozart, Beethoven or Tchiakovsky.
176.814	Because classical music
178.426	is an unbroken living tradition
181.843	that goes back over 1,000 years.
185.093	And every one of those years
187.137	has had something unique and powerful to say to us
190.635	about what it's like to be alive.
193.86	Now the raw material of it, of course,
196.419	is just the music of everyday life.
198.135	It's all the anthems and dance crazes
201.168	and ballads and marches.
202.903	But what classical music does
205.593	is to distill all of these musics down,
210.453	to condense them to their absolute essence,
214.139	and from that essence create a new language,
217.427	a language that speaks very lovingly and unflinchingly
222.912	about who we really are.
225.012	It's a language that's still evolving.
227.856	Now over the centuries it grew into the big pieces we always think of,
231.427	like concertos and symphonies,
234.427	but even the most ambitious masterpiece
237.758	can have as its central mission
240.177	to bring you back to a fragile and personal moment --
244.677	like this one from the Beethoven Violin Concerto.
247.885	(Music)
270.271	It's so simple, so evocative.
276.255	So many emotions seem to be inside of it.
279.115	Yet, of course, like all music,
280.843	it's essentially not about anything.
283.302	It's just a design of pitches and silence and time.
287.085	And the pitches, the notes, as you know, are just vibrations.
291.177	They're locations in the spectrum of sound.
294.13	And whether we call them 440 per second, A,
298.231	or 3,729, B flat -- trust me, that's right --
304.949	they're just phenomena.
309.045	But the way we react to different combinations of these phenomena
312.802	is complex and emotional and not totally understood.
316.596	And the way we react to them has changed radically over the centuries,
320.427	as have our preferences for them.
322.802	So for example, in the 11th century,
326.093	people liked pieces that ended like this.
329.933	(Music)
341.666	And in the 17th century, it was more like this.
346.822	(Music)
352.26	And in the 21st century ...
356.102	(Music)
363.51	Now your 21st century ears are quite happy with this last chord,
368.829	even though a while back it would have puzzled or annoyed you
372.302	or sent some of you running from the room.
373.802	And the reason you like it
375.218	is because you've inherited, whether you knew it or not,
377.706	centuries-worth of changes
380.26	in musical theory, practice and fashion.
383.76	And in classical music we can follow these changes very, very accurately
388.85	because of the music's powerful silent partner,
392.833	the way it's been passed on: notation.
396.462	Now the impulse to notate,
398.427	or, more exactly I should say, encode music
401.218	has been with us for a very long time.
404.276	In 200 B.C., a man named Sekulos
408.177	wrote this song for his departed wife
411.127	and inscribed it on her gravestone
412.718	in the notational system of the Greeks.
415.343	(Music)
442.718	And a thousand years later,
445.135	this impulse to notate took an entirely different form.
449.145	And you can see how this happened
450.51	"in these excerpts from the Christmas mass ""Puer Natus est nobis,"""
457.093	"""For Us is Born."""
459.468	(Music)
464.101	In the 10th century, little squiggles were used
466.343	just to indicate the general shape of the tune.
469.385	And in the 12th century, a line was drawn, like a musical horizon line,
476.427	to better pinpoint the pitch's location.
480.005	And then in the 13th century, more lines and new shapes of notes
488.35	locked in the concept of the tune exactly,
491.968	and that led to the kind of notation we have today.
494.635	Well notation not only passed the music on,
498.306	notating and encoding the music changed its priorities entirely,
502.987	because it enabled the musicians
504.943	to imagine music on a much vaster scale.
508.599	Now inspired moves of improvisation
511.927	could be recorded, saved, considered, prioritized,
515.927	made into intricate designs.
518.468	And from this moment, classical music became
521.708	what it most essentially is,
524.302	a dialogue between the two powerful sides of our nature:
529.343	instinct and intelligence.
531.718	And there began to be a real difference at this point
535.093	between the art of improvisation
538.01	and the art of composition.
539.418	Now an improviser senses and plays the next cool move,
543.935	but a composer is considering all possible moves,
547.552	testing them out, prioritizing them out,
550.871	until he sees how they can form a powerful and coherent design
555.343	of ultimate and enduring coolness.
559.75	Now some of the greatest composers, like Bach,
561.302	were combinations of these two things.
563.531	Bach was like a great improviser with a mind of a chess master.
567.816	Mozart was the same way.
569.76	But every musician strikes a different balance
573.006	between faith and reason, instinct and intelligence.
576.802	And every musical era had different priorities of these things,
581.71	different things to pass on, different 'whats' and 'hows'.
585.677	So in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition
590.245	the big 'what' was to praise God.
593.093	And by the 1400s, music was being written
595.718	that tried to mirror God's mind
599.802	as could be seen in the design of the night sky.
603.718	The 'how' was a style called polyphony,
607.01	music of many independently moving voices
610.76	that suggested the way the planets seemed to move
613.468	in Ptolemy's geocentric universe.
616.097	This was truly the music of the spheres.
619.883	(Music)
649.177	This is the kind of music that Leonardo DaVinci would have known.
654.427	And perhaps its tremendous intellectual perfection and serenity
658.025	meant that something new had to happen --
660.885	a radical new move, which in 1600 is what did happen.
665.01	(Music) Singer: Ah, bitter blow!
671.843	Ah, wicked, cruel fate!
676.635	Ah, baleful stars!
683.552	Ah, avaricious heaven!
690.51	MTT: This, of course, was the birth of opera,
694.218	and its development put music on a radical new course.
696.83	The what now was not to mirror the mind of God,
701.185	but to follow the emotion turbulence of man.
704.135	And the how was harmony,
707.427	stacking up the pitches to form chords.
710.718	And the chords, it turned out,
712.468	were capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions.
716.552	And the basic chords were the ones we still have with us,
721.351	the triads,
722.612	either the major one,
725.871	which we think is happy,
730.479	or the minor one,
733.824	which we perceive as sad.
737.76	But what's the actual difference between these two chords?
741.029	It's just these two notes in the middle.
743.266	It's either E natural,
746.231	and 659 vibrations per second,
750.947	or E flat, at 622.
755.635	So the big difference between human happiness and sadness?
764.01	So you can see in a system like this
767.927	there was enormous subtle potential
769.956	of representing human emotions.
771.831	And in fact, as man began to understand more
775.564	his complex and ambivalent nature,
777.727	harmony grew more complex to reflect it.
780.385	Turns out it was capable of expressing emotions
784.444	beyond the ability of words.
786.177	Now with all this possibility,
789.51	classical music really took off.
793.593	It's the time in which the big forms began to arise.
796.989	And the effects of technology began to be felt also,
801.593	because printing put music, the scores, the codebooks of music,
806.029	into the hands of performers everywhere.
808.039	And new and improved instruments
810.26	made the age of the virtuoso possible.
813.552	This is when those big forms arose --
816.802	the symphonies, the sonatas, the concertos.
819.921	And in these big architectures of time,
823.927	composers like Beethoven could share the insights of a lifetime.
829.635	A piece like Beethoven's Fifth
832.095	basically witnessing how it was possible
836.453	for him to go from sorrow and anger,
841.97	over the course of a half an hour,
845.677	step by exacting step of his route,
849.468	to the moment when he could make it across to joy.
853.808	(Music)
876.302	And it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues,
881.343	like gripping ones of culture,
883.97	such as nationalism or quest for freedom
886.718	or the frontiers of sensuality.
890.589	But whatever direction the music took,
894.36	one thing until recently was always the same,
896.898	and that was when the musicians stopped playing,
899.927	the music stopped.
902.302	Now this moment so fascinates me.
905.665	I find it such a profound one.
907.576	What happens when the music stops?
908.943	Where does it go? What's left?
912.385	What sticks with people in the audience at the end of a performance?
915.673	Is it a melody or a rhythm
917.445	or a mood or an attitude?
920.225	And how might that change their lives?
922.494	To me this is the intimate, personal side of music.
926.427	It's the passing on part. It's the 'why' part of it.
930.968	And to me that's the most essential of all.
934.226	Mostly it's been a person-to-person thing,
938.185	a teacher-student, performer-audience thing,
940.792	and then around 1880 came this new technology
943.569	that first mechanically then through analogs then digitally
946.26	created a new and miraculous way of passing things on,
950.547	albeit an impersonal one.
952.335	People could now hear music all the time,
956.052	even though it wasn't necessary
956.927	for them to play an instrument, read music or even go to concerts.
961.468	And technology democratized music by making everything available.
966.772	It spearheaded a cultural revolution
968.533	in which artists like Caruso and Bessie Smith were on the same footing.
973.393	And technology pushed composers to tremendous extremes,
977.314	using computers and synthesizers
979.014	to create works of intellectually impenetrable complexity
981.933	beyond the means of performers and audiences.
986.468	At the same time technology,
988.968	by taking over the role that notation had always played,
992.26	shifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence
996.802	way over to the instinctive side.
1000.093	The culture in which we live now
1001.983	is awash with music of improvisation
1005.052	that's been sliced, diced, layered
1006.677	and, God knows, distributed and sold.
1010.427	What's the long-term effect of this on us or on music?
1013.714	Nobody knows.
1014.721	The question remains: What happens when the music stops?
1018.443	What sticks with people?
1020.425	Now that we have unlimited access to music, what does stick with us?
1024.377	Well let me show you a story of what I mean
1026.797	"by ""really sticking with us."""
1028.589	I was visiting a cousin of mine in an old age home,
1031.677	and I spied a very shaky old man
1035.012	making his way across the room on a walker.
1037.289	He came over to a piano that was there,
1039.805	and he balanced himself and began playing something like this.
1044.135	(Music)
1048.67	"And he said something like, ""Me ... boy ... symphony ... Beethoven."""
1057.533	And I suddenly got it,
1059.085	"and I said, ""Friend, by any chance are you trying to play this?"""
1062.005	(Music)
1066.956	"And he said, ""Yes, yes. I was a little boy."
1069.385	"The symphony: Isaac Stern, the concerto, I heard it."""
1073.981	And I thought, my God,
1075.664	how much must this music mean to this man
1078.51	that he would get himself out of his bed, across the room
1082.627	to recover the memory of this music
1085.927	that, after everything else in his life is sloughing away,
1088.835	still means so much to him?
1091.093	Well, that's why I take every performance so seriously,
1095.016	why it matters to me so much.
1096.766	I never know who might be there, who might be absorbing it
1100.218	and what will happen to it in their life.
1101.968	But now I'm excited that there's more chance than ever before possible
1107.055	of sharing this music.
1108.385	That's what drives my interest in projects
1110.131	"like the TV series ""Keeping Score"" with the San Francisco Symphony"
1113.51	that looks at the backstories of music,
1116.077	and working with the young musicians at the New World Symphony
1119.254	on projects that explore the potential
1120.848	of the new performing arts centers
1124.354	for both entertainment and education.
1126.728	And of course, the New World Symphony
1128.695	led to the YouTube Symphony and projects on the internet
1132.343	that reach out to musicians and audiences all over the world.
1135.347	And the exciting thing is all this is just a prototype.
1140.127	There's just a role here for so many people --
1142.381	teachers, parents, performers --
1145.177	to be explorers together.
1148.037	Sure, the big events attract a lot of attention,
1150.822	but what really matters is what goes on every single day.
1154.302	We need your perspectives, your curiosity, your voices.
1158.772	And it excites me now to meet people
1161.862	who are hikers, chefs, code writers, taxi drivers,
1164.96	people I never would have guessed who loved the music
1167.725	and who are passing it on.
1168.84	You don't need to worry about knowing anything.
1172.581	If you're curious, if you have a capacity for wonder, if you're alive,
1176.343	you know all that you need to know.
1179.403	You can start anywhere. Ramble a bit.
1181.612	Follow traces. Get lost. Be surprised, amused inspired.
1185.716	All that 'what', all that 'how' is out there
1190.335	waiting for you to discover its 'why',
1192.829	to dive in and pass it on.
1195.887	Thank you.
1198.385	(Applause)
