13.228	In many patriarchal societies and tribal societies,
17.262	fathers are usually known by their sons,
22.487	but I'm one of the few fathers
25.703	who is known by his daughter,
27.747	and I am proud of it.
29.373	(Applause)
35.81	Malala started her campaign for education
38.658	and stood for her rights in 2007,
41.545	and when her efforts were honored in 2011,
46.103	and she was given the national youth peace prize,
49.543	and she became a very famous,
51.412	very popular young girl of her country.
55.456	Before that, she was my daughter,
58.784	but now I am her father.
62.741	Ladies and gentlemen,
64.496	if we glance to human history,
67.643	the story of women
70.471	is the story of injustice,
73.847	inequality,
75.907	violence and exploitation.
81.218	You see,
83.053	in patriarchal societies,
87.204	right from the very beginning,
89.646	when a girl is born,
92.652	her birth is not celebrated.
96.932	She is not welcomed,
99.096	neither by father nor by mother.
101.872	The neighborhood comes
103.557	and commiserates with the mother,
106.058	and nobody congratulates the father.
111.152	And a mother is very uncomfortable
115.467	for having a girl child.
119.834	When she gives birth to the first girl child,
123.094	first daughter, she is sad.
127.183	When she gives birth to the second daughter,
130.93	she is shocked,
132.777	and in the expectation of a son,
136.161	when she gives birth to a third daughter,
139.367	she feels guilty like a criminal.
144.906	Not only the mother suffers,
147.54	but the daughter, the newly born daughter,
150.277	when she grows old,
152.412	she suffers too.
154.547	At the age of five,
156.6	while she should be going to school,
159.929	she stays at home
161.672	and her brothers are admitted in a school.
166.294	Until the age of 12, somehow,
168.887	she has a good life.
171.528	She can have fun.
173.199	She can play with her friends in the streets,
176.388	and she can move around in the streets
178.427	like a butterfly.
181.202	But when she enters her teens,
185.017	when she becomes 13 years old,
187.357	she is forbidden to go out of her home
190.976	without a male escort.
194.468	She is confined under the four walls of her home.
199.843	She is no more a free individual.
205.037	She becomes the so-called honor
208.057	of her father and of her brothers
210.538	and of her family,
213.988	and if she transgresses
216.676	the code of that so-called honor,
219.887	she could even be killed.
224.251	And it is also interesting that this so-called
228.252	code of honor,
229.615	it does not only affect the life of a girl,
233.305	it also affects the life
235.431	of the male members of the family.
240.23	I know a family of seven sisters and one brother,
246.823	and that one brother,
248.645	he has migrated to the Gulf countries,
252.149	to earn a living for his seven sisters
254.844	and parents,
257.192	because he thinks that it will be humiliating
263.046	if his seven sisters learn a skill
265.768	and they go out of the home
268.148	and earn some livelihood.
272.299	So this brother,
273.889	he sacrifices the joys of his life
277.242	and the happiness of his sisters
280.634	at the altar of so-called honor.
285.218	And there is one more norm
286.752	of the patriarchal societies
289.11	that is called obedience.
293.56	A good girl is supposed to be
297.346	very quiet, very humble
302.594	and very submissive.
306.565	It is the criteria.
307.904	The role model good girl should be very quiet.
311.736	She is supposed to be silent
314.025	and she is supposed to accept the decisions
317.196	of her father and mother
319.416	and the decisions of elders,
322.641	even if she does not like them.
325.047	If she is married to a man she doesn't like
328.376	or if she is married to an old man,
331.118	she has to accept,
332.678	because she does not want to be dubbed
335.196	as disobedient.
337.819	If she is married very early,
339.451	she has to accept.
340.925	Otherwise, she will be called disobedient.
344.947	And what happens at the end?
347.75	In the words of a poetess,
349.505	she is wedded, bedded,
352.292	and then she gives birth
352.292	to more sons and daughters.
357.463	And it is the irony of the situation
360.232	that this mother,
362.564	she teaches the same lesson of obedience
365.616	to her daughter
366.676	and the same lesson of honor to her sons.
371.109	And this vicious cycle goes on, goes on.
377.997	Ladies and gentlemen,
380.524	this plight of millions of women
383.746	could be changed
386.578	if we think differently,
388.953	if women and men think differently,
392.934	if men and women in the
392.934	tribal and patriarchal societies
397.152	in the developing countries,
399.135	if they can break a few norms
402.046	of family and society,
406.65	if they can abolish the discriminatory laws
412.13	of the systems in their states,
414.658	which go against the basic human rights
416.949	of the women.
420.743	Dear brothers and sisters, when Malala was born,
425.987	and for the first time,
428.14	believe me,
429.414	I don't like newborn children, to be honest,
434.391	but when I went and I looked into her eyes,
438.173	believe me,
440.293	I got extremely honored.
444.274	And long before she was born,
446.444	I thought about her name,
449.48	and I was fascinated with a heroic
452.765	legendary freedom fighter in Afghanistan.
456.63	Her name was Malalai of Maiwand,
461.639	and I named my daughter after her.
465.924	A few days after Malala was born,
468.916	my daughter was born,
470.655	my cousin came --
472.313	and it was a coincidence --
474.281	he came to my home
476.996	and he brought a family tree,
479.701	a family tree of the Yousafzai family,
483.369	and when I looked at the family tree,
485.925	it traced back to 300 years of our ancestors.
491.978	But when I looked, all were men,
496.375	and I picked my pen,
498.797	drew a line from my name,
500.801	"and wrote, ""Malala."""
505.585	And when she grow old,
508.355	when she was four and a half years old,
511.938	I admitted her in my school.
515.474	You will be asking, then, why should I mention about
518.38	the admission of a girl in a school?
520.882	Yes, I must mention it.
522.937	It may be taken for granted in Canada,
526.022	in America, in many developed countries,
529.849	but in poor countries,
532.307	in patriarchal societies, in tribal societies,
535.875	it's a big event for the life of girl.
539.489	Enrollment in a school means
543.128	recognition of her identity and her name.
548.877	Admission in a school means
550.555	that she has entered the world of dreams
554.237	and aspirations
555.9	where she can explore her potentials
559.412	for her future life.
562.658	I have five sisters,
564.737	and none of them could go to school,
568.051	and you will be astonished,
569.625	two weeks before,
573.735	when I was filling out the Canadian visa form,
578.018	and I was filling out the family part of the form,
582.683	I could not recall
584.767	the surnames of some of my sisters.
588.772	And the reason was
590.621	that I have never, never seen the names
593.913	of my sisters written on any document.
599.739	That was the reason that
602.679	I valued my daughter.
606.212	What my father could not give to my sisters
610.525	and to his daughters,
612.28	I thought I must change it.
616.521	I used to appreciate the intelligence
619.528	and the brilliance of my daughter.
623.2	I encouraged her to sit with me
625.794	when my friends used to come.
627.453	I encouraged her to go with
627.453	me to different meetings.
632.237	And all these good values,
633.898	I tried to inculcate in her personality.
637.108	And this was not only she, only Malala.
640.771	I imparted all these good values
643.507	to my school, girl students 
643.507	and boy students as well.
648.05	I used education for emancipation.
652.429	I taught my girls,
654.294	I taught my girl students,
656.249	to unlearn the lesson of obedience.
661.318	I taught my boy students
664.283	to unlearn the lesson of so-called pseudo-honor.
673.696	Dear brothers and sisters,
677.681	we were striving for more rights for women,
682.264	and we were struggling to have more,
685.886	more and more space for the women in society.
690.113	But we came across a new phenomenon.
693.326	It was lethal to human rights
695.819	and particularly to women's rights.
699.267	It was called Talibanization.
703.944	It means a complete negation
707.632	of women's participation
709.842	in all political, economical and social activities.
716.037	Hundreds of schools were lost.
719.584	Girls were prohibited from going to school.
725.815	Women were forced to wear veils
729.521	and they were stopped from going to the markets.
733.077	Musicians were silenced,
735.661	girls were flogged
737.618	and singers were killed.
741.101	Millions were suffering,
742.975	but few spoke,
746.22	and it was the most scary thing
748.444	when you have all around such people
754.53	who kill and who flog,
756.556	and you speak for your rights.
757.852	It's really the most scary thing.
762.059	At the age of 10,
763.952	Malala stood, and she stood for the right
768.196	of education.
770.507	She wrote a diary for the BBC blog,
775.279	she volunteered herself
777.483	for the New York Times documentaries,
781.077	and she spoke from every platform she could.
785.993	And her voice was the most powerful voice.
790.381	It spread like a crescendo all around the world.
796.634	And that was the reason the Taliban
798.486	could not tolerate her campaign,
802.817	and on October 9 2012,
805.666	she was shot in the head at point blank range.
811.415	It was a doomsday for my family and for me.
815.56	The world turned into a big black hole.
821.379	While my daughter was
823.045	on the verge of life and death,
826.497	I whispered into the ears of my wife,
830.336	"""Should I be blamed for what happened"
833.438	"to my daughter and your daughter?"""
837.114	And she abruptly told me,
839.635	"""Please don't blame yourself."
842.146	You stood for the right cause.
845.362	You put your life at stake
847.497	for the cause of truth,
848.9	for the cause of peace,
850.081	and for the cause of education,
852.189	and your daughter in inspired from you
854.238	and she joined you.
856.469	You both were on the right path
858.144	"and God will protect her."""
861.517	These few words meant a lot to me,
864.863	and I didn't ask this question again.
868.974	When Malala was in the hospital,
873.094	and she was going through the severe pains
876.341	and she had had severe headaches
878.861	because her facial nerve was cut down,
882.049	I used to see a dark shadow
884.501	spreading on the face of my wife.
890.038	But my daughter never complained.
896.139	She used to tell us,
898.2	"""I'm fine with my crooked smile"
900.251	and with my numbness in my face.
902.993	"I'll be okay. Please don't worry."""
905.072	She was a solace for us,
907.201	and she consoled us.
912.12	Dear brothers and sisters,
916.341	we learned from her how to be resilient
918.963	in the most difficult times,
922.268	and I'm glad to share with you
925.276	that despite being an icon
931.168	for the rights of children and women,
933.997	she is like any 16-year old girl.
939.29	She cries when her homework is incomplete.
944.422	She quarrels with her brothers,
946.49	and I am very happy for that.
950.213	People ask me,
952.616	what special is in my mentorship
956.108	which has made Malala so bold
958.648	and so courageous and so vocal and poised?
963.14	I tell them, don't ask me what I did.
969.415	Ask me what I did not do.
973.276	I did not clip her wings, and that's all.
978.533	Thank you very much.
981.415	(Applause)
986.911	Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause)
