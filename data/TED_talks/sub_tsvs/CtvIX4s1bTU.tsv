13.8	So there are lands
13.8	few and far between on Earth itself
17.36	that are hospitable to humans
17.36	by any measure,
21.44	but survive we have.
23.8	Our primitive ancestors, when they found
23.8	their homes and livelihood endangered,
28.079	they dared to make their way
28.079	into unfamiliar territories
31.24	in search of better opportunities.
33.76	And as the descendants of these explorers,
36	we have their nomadic blood
36	coursing through our own veins.
40.04	But at the same time,
41.52	distracted by our bread and circuses
43.64	and embroiled in the wars
43.64	that we have waged on each other,
47.84	it seems that we have forgotten
47.84	this desire to explore.
52.32	We, as a species, we're evolved uniquely
56.96	for Earth, on Earth, and by Earth,
61.68	and so content are we
61.68	with our living conditions
64.84	that we have grown complacent
64.84	and just too busy
68.28	to notice that its resources are finite,
70.76	and that our Sun's life is also finite.
74.4	While Mars and all the movies
74.4	made in its name
77.2	have reinvigorated
77.2	the ethos for space travel,
80.24	few of us seem to truly realize
80.24	that our species' fragile constitution
85.64	is woefully unprepared
85.64	for long duration journeys into space.
90.16	Let us take a trek
90.16	to your local national forest
92.44	for a quick reality check.
94.28	So just a quick show of hands here:
96	how many of you think you would be able
96	to survive in this lush wilderness
99.6	for a few days?
102	Well, that's a lot of you.
103.32	How about a few weeks?
106	That's a decent amount.
107.28	How about a few months?
109.6	That's pretty good too.
111.12	Now, let us imagine
111.12	that this local national forest
113.8	experiences an eternal winter.
117.36	Same questions: how many of you think you
117.36	would be able to survive for a few days?
122.28	That's quite a lot.
123.72	How about a few weeks?
126.4	So for a fun twist, let us imagine
126.4	that the only source of water available
131.12	is trapped as frozen blocks
131.12	miles below the surface.
135.08	Soil nutrients are so minimal
135.08	that no vegetation can be found,
139.2	and of course hardly any atmosphere
139.2	exists to speak of.
145.24	Such examples are only a few
145.24	of the many challenges we would face
149.4	on a planet like Mars.
152	So how do we steel ourselves for voyages
152	whose destinations are so far removed
157.2	from a tropical vacation?
159.52	Will we continuously ship supplies
159.52	from Planet Earth?
162.88	Build space elevators,
162.88	or impossible miles of transport belts
166.36	that tether your planet of choice
166.36	to our home planet?
170.16	And how do we grow things like food
170.16	that grew up on Earth like us?
177.08	But I'm getting ahead of myself.
179.56	In our species' journey
179.56	to find a new home under a new sun,
183.72	we are more likely than not
183.72	going to be spending much time
187.6	in the journey itself,
189.84	in space,
191.48	on a ship, a hermetic flying can,
195.12	possibly for many generations.
197.48	The longest continuous amount of time
197.48	that any human has spent in space
200.92	is in the vicinity of 12 to 14 months.
204.6	From astronauts' experiences in space,
206.96	we know that spending time
206.96	in a microgravity environment
210.76	means bone loss, muscle atrophy,
210.76	cardiovascular problems,
215.36	among many other complications
216.96	that range for the physiological
216.96	to the psychological.
221.2	And what about macrogravity,
222.64	or any other variation
222.64	in gravitational pull
225.16	of the planet that we find ourselves on?
228.56	In short, our cosmic voyages
228.56	will be fraught with dangers
232.12	both known and unknown.
234.96	So far we've been looking to this
234.96	new piece of mechanical technology
239	or that great next generation robot
241.28	as part of a lineup to ensure
241.28	our species safe passage in space.
245.6	Wonderful as they are,
245.6	I believe the time has come
248.56	for us to complement
248.56	these bulky electronic giants
252.84	with what nature has already invented:
256.32	the microbe,
257.72	a single-celled organism that is itself
257.72	a self-generating, self-replenishing,
262.96	living machine.
264.76	It requires fairly little to maintain,
267.2	offers much flexibility in design
269.12	and only asks to be carried
269.12	in a single plastic tube.
273.399	The field of study that has enabled us
273.399	to utilize the capabilities of the microbe
277.28	is known as synthetic biology.
279.52	It comes from molecular biology,
279.52	which has given us antibiotics, vaccines
283.56	and better ways to observe
283.56	the physiological nuances
286.88	of the human body.
288.52	Using the tools of synthetic biology,
290.52	we can now edit the genes
290.52	of nearly any organism,
293.48	microscopic or not,
295.44	with incredible speed and fidelity.
298.76	Given the limitations
298.76	of our man-made machines,
301.68	synthetic biology will be a means for us
301.68	to engineer not only our food,
305.68	our fuel and our environment,
308.44	but also ourselves
310.76	to compensate
310.76	for our physical inadequacies
313.4	and to ensure our survival in space.
317	To give you an example
318.24	of how we can use synthetic biology
318.24	for space exploration,
321.08	let us return to the Mars environment.
324.16	The Martian soil composition is similar
324.16	to that of Hawaiian volcanic ash,
328.92	with trace amounts of organic material.
331.4	Let's say, hypothetically,
333.68	what if martian soil
333.68	could actually support plant growth
336.44	without using Earth-derived nutrients?
339.36	The first question
339.36	we should probably ask is,
341.48	how would we make
341.48	our plants cold-tolerant?
343.88	Because, on average,
343.88	the temperature on Mars
346	is a very uninviting
346	negative 60 degrees centigrade.
350	The next question we should ask is,
351.8	how do we make
351.8	our plants drought-tolerant?
354.28	Considering that most of the water
354.28	that forms as frost
357.12	evaporates more quickly
357.12	"than I can say the word ""evaporate."""
361.12	Well, it turns out
361.12	we've already done things like this.
364.48	By borrowing genes
364.48	for anti-freeze protein from fish
367.8	and genes for drought tolerance
367.8	from other plants like rice
371	and then stitching them
371	into the plants that need them,
373.72	we now have plants that can tolerate
373.72	most droughts and freezes.
377.48	They're known on Earth as GMOs,
380.12	or genetically modified organisms,
382.68	and we rely on them to feed
382.68	all the mouths of human civilization.
388.16	Nature does stuff like this already,
391.6	without our help.
393.16	We have simply found
393.16	more precise ways to do it.
397.48	So why would we want to change
397.48	the genetic makeup of plants for space?
402.12	Well, to not do so
402.12	would mean needing to engineer
405.72	endless acres of land
405.72	on an entirely new planet
409.16	by releasing trillions of gallons
409.16	of atmospheric gasses
412.68	and then constructing
412.68	a giant glass dome to contain it all.
416.48	It's an unrealistic engineering enterprise
418.56	that quickly becomes
418.56	a high-cost cargo transport mission.
423.24	One of the best ways to ensure
424.72	that we will have the food supplies
424.72	and the air that we need
427.84	is to bring with us organisms
427.84	that have been engineered
430.96	to adapt to new and harsh environments.
434.76	In essence, using engineered organisms
434.76	to help us terraform a planet
438.76	both in the short and long term.
442.4	These organisms can then also
442.4	be engineered to make medicine or fuel.
447.92	So we can use synthetic biology
447.92	to bring highly engineered plants with us,
451.68	but what else can we do?
453.88	Well, I mentioned earlier
453.88	that we, as a species,
456.76	were evolved uniquely for planet Earth.
459.8	That fact has not changed much
459.8	in the last five minutes
462.44	that you were sitting here
462.44	and I was standing there.
465.48	And so, if we were to dump
465.48	any of us on Mars right this minute,
469.2	even given ample food, water, air
472.72	and a suit,
473.96	we are likely to experience
473.96	very unpleasant health problems
477.36	from the amount of ionizing radiation
477.36	that bombards the surface
480.68	of planets like Mars that have little
480.68	or nonexistent atmosphere.
485.28	Unless we plan
485.28	to stay holed up underground
487.32	for the duration of our stay
487.32	on every new planet,
490.48	we must find better ways
490.48	of protecting ourselves
493.08	without needing to resort
493.08	to wearing a suit of armor
495.76	that weighs something
495.76	equal to your own body weight,
498.24	or needing to hide behind a wall of lead.
502.24	So let us appeal
502.24	to nature for inspiration.
506.2	Among the plethora of life here on Earth,
508.32	there's a subset of organisms
508.32	known as extremophiles,
511.2	or lovers of extreme living conditions,
513.2	if you'll remember
513.2	from high school biology.
515.68	And among these organisms is a bacterium
515.68	by the name of Deinococcus radiodurans.
521.04	It is known to be able to withstand cold,
521.04	dehydration, vacuum, acid,
526.44	and, most notably, radiation.
529.44	While its radiation
529.44	tolerance mechanisms are known,
532.159	we have yet to adapt
532.159	the relevant genes to mammals.
535.52	To do so is not particularly easy.
538.16	There are many facets
538.16	that go into its radiation tolerance,
541	and it's not as simple
541	as transferring one gene.
543.96	But given a little bit of human ingenuity
547.24	and a little bit of time,
548.52	I think to do so is not very hard either.
552	Even if we borrow just a fraction
552	of its ability to tolerate radiation,
558.4	it would be infinitely better
558.4	than what we already have,
561.44	which is just the melanin in our skin.
564.56	Using the tools of synthetic biology,
566.6	we can harness Deinococcus
566.6	radiodurans' ability
569.64	to thrive under otherwise
569.64	very lethal doses of radiation.
575.76	As difficult as it is to see,
577.92	homo sapiens, that is humans,
581.2	evolves every day,
583.52	and still continues to evolve.
586.36	Thousands of years of human evolution
588.16	has not only given us
588.16	humans like Tibetans,
591.16	who can thrive in low-oxygen conditions,
593.76	but also Argentinians,
593.76	who can ingest and metabolize arsenic,
598.72	the chemical element
598.72	that can kill the average human being.
602.36	Every day, the human body evolves
602.36	by accidental mutations
606.08	that equally accidentally
606.08	allow certain humans
608.96	to persevere in dismal situations.
612.16	But, and this is a big but,
615.48	such evolution requires two things
615.48	that we may not always have,
619.68	or be able to afford,
622.12	and they are death and time.
625.56	In our species' struggle
625.56	to find our place in the universe,
628.6	we may not always have the time necessary
631.08	for the natural evolution
631.08	of extra functions
633.64	for survival on non-Earth planets.
636.36	We're living in what E.O. Wilson
636.36	has termed the age of gene circumvention,
640.88	during which we remedy our genetic defects
640.88	like cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy
646.28	with temporary external supplements.
649.96	But with every passing day,
651.52	we approach the age
651.52	of volitional evolution,
654.72	a time during which we as a species
656.72	will have the capacity to decide
656.72	for ourselves our own genetic destiny.
662.72	Augmenting the human body
662.72	with new abilities
665.08	is no longer a question of how,
667.92	but of when.
670.24	Using synthetic biology
671.52	to change the genetic makeup
671.52	of any living organisms,
674.64	especially our own,
675.88	is not without its moral
675.88	and ethical quandaries.
679.28	Will engineering ourselves
679.28	make us less human?
682.96	But then again, what is humanity
685.24	but star stuff
685.24	that happens to be conscious?
689.2	Where should human genius direct itself?
692.64	Surely it is a bit of a waste
692.64	to sit back and marvel at it.
697.8	How do we use our knowledge
699.16	to protect ourselves
699.16	from the external dangers
702.44	and then protect ourselves from ourselves?
706.4	I pose these questions
707.84	not to engender the fear of science
710.04	but to bring to light
710.04	the many possibilities
712.44	that science has afforded
712.44	and continues to afford us.
716.76	We must coalesce as humans
716.76	to discuss and embrace the solutions
720.76	not only with caution
722.64	but also with courage.
726.2	Mars is a destination,
730.44	but it will not be our last.
733	Our true final frontier
733	is the line we must cross
735.88	in deciding what we can and should make
735.88	of our species' improbable intelligence.
741.88	Space is cold, brutal and unforgiving.
747.12	Our path to the stars
747.12	will be rife with trials
749.56	that will bring us to question
749.56	not only who we are
752.56	but where we will be going.
755.16	The answers will lie in our choice
755.16	to use or abandon the technology
758.76	that we have gleaned from life itself,
760.88	and it will define us for the remainder
760.88	of our term in this universe.
764.76	Thank you.
766	(Applause)
