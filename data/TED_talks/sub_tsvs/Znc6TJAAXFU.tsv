12.985	At Free America, we've done
12.985	a listening and learning tour.
16.39	We visited not only with prosecutors
19.858	but with legislators,
21.628	with inmates in our state
21.628	and local prisons.
27.282	We've gone to immigration
27.282	detention centers.
30.239	We've met a lot of people.
33.174	And we've seen that redemption
33.174	and transformation can happen
39.422	in our prisons, our jails
39.422	and our immigration detention centers,
44.133	giving hope to those
44.133	who want to create a better life
47.174	after serving their time.
50.028	Imagine if we also considered
50.028	the front end of this prison pipeline.
53.964	What would it look like
53.964	if we intervened,
55.929	with rehabilitation as a core value --
58.906	with love and compassion as core values?
62.523	We would have a society that is safer,
64.846	healthier
66.021	and worthy of raising our children in.
68.864	I want to introduce you to James Cavitt.
72.036	James served 12 years
72.036	in the San Quentin State Prison
76.563	and is being released in 18 months.
79.809	Now James, like you and me,
81.798	is more than the worst thing he's done.
85.691	He is a father, a husband, a son, a poet.
89.265	He committed a crime;
90.906	he's paying his debt,
92.547	and working hard to build the skills
95.035	to make the transition back
95.035	to a productive life
98.762	when he enters the civilian
98.762	population again.
101.807	Now James, like millions
101.807	of people behind bars,
104.485	is an example of what happens
106.544	if we believe that our failings
106.544	don't define who we are,
111.019	that we are all worthy of redemption
113.345	and if we support those impacted
113.345	by mass incarceration,
117.606	we can all heal together.
120.034	I'd like to introduce you
120.034	to James right now,
122.344	and he's going to share
122.344	his journey of redemption
124.852	through spoken word.
128.432	James Cavitt: Thanks, John.
129.806	TED, welcome to San Quentin.
132.521	The talent is abundant
132.521	behind prison walls.
135.608	Future software engineers,
137.664	entrepreneurs,
138.967	craftsmen,
140.142	musicians
141.317	and artists.
142.624	This piece is inspired
142.624	by all of the hard work
145.745	that men and women are doing on the inside
148.997	to create better lives
148.997	and futures for themselves
152.346	after they serve their time.
154.931	"This piece is entitled, ""Where I Live."""
160.218	I live in a world where most people
160.218	are too afraid to go.
164.441	Surrounded by tall, concrete walls,
166.801	steel bars,
167.976	where razor wire have a way
169.294	of cutting away at the hopes
169.294	for a brighter tomorrow.
173.697	I live in a world
174.872	that kill people who kill people
176.429	in order to teach people
177.604	that killing people is wrong.
180.285	Imagine that.
182.111	Better yet,
183.286	imagine a world where healed people
183.286	helped hurt people heal
186.38	and become strong.
188.427	Maybe then we would all
188.427	"be singin' ""Redemption Song."""
193.08	I live in a world that
193.08	"has been called ""hell on Earth"""
196.013	by those trapped inside.
199.046	But I've come to the stark realization
200.993	that prison --
202.78	it really is what you make it.
205.192	You see, in spite
205.192	of the harshness of my reality,
207.931	there is a silver lining.
210.47	I knew that my freedom was gonna come,
212.312	it was just a matter of time.
213.725	And so I treated my first steps
213.725	as if they were my last mile,
217.141	and I realized that you
217.141	don't have to be free
220.122	in order to experience freedom.
222.89	And just because you're free,
224.673	doesn't mean that you have freedom.
226.996	Many of us, for years,
226.996	have been battling our inner demons.
230.266	We walk around smiling
230.266	when inside we're really screamin':
233.631	freedom!
236.171	Don't you get it?
238.018	We're all serving time;
239.527	we're just in different places.
241.78	As for me,
242.955	I choose to be free
242.955	from the prisons I've created.
245.559	The key:
246.734	forgiveness.
247.909	Action's my witness.
249.084	If we want freedom,
251.122	then we gotta think different.
253.69	Because freedom ...
257.227	it isn't a place.
259.783	It's a mind setting.
262.996	Thank you.
264.171	(Applause)
267.536	(Piano)
285.789	John Legend: Old pirates, yes, they rob I.
290.233	Sold I to the merchant ships.
295.414	Minutes after they took I
299.622	from the bottomless pit.
303.191	My hands were made strong
307.969	by the hand of the almighty.
312.213	We forward in this generation
317.798	triumphantly.
321.343	Won't you help to sing
326.686	these songs of freedom?
329.899	'Cause all I ever had --
335.238	redemption songs.
339.722	Redemption songs.
343.947	Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery.
348.277	None but ourselves can free our minds.
353.253	Have no fear for atomic energy
357.269	'cause none of them can stop the time.
361.719	How long shall they kill our prophets
365.433	while we stand aside and look?
370.329	Some say it's just a part of it,
374.447	we've got to fulfill the book.
378.877	Won't you help to sing
384.048	these songs of freedom?
387.263	'Cause all I ever had --
392.322	redemption songs.
396.387	Redemption songs.
398.776	(Piano)
416.291	Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery.
420.423	None but ourselves can free our minds.
424.96	Have no fear for atomic energy
429.059	'cause none of them can stop the time.
432.933	How long shall they kill our prophets
437.146	while we stand aside and look?
440.178	Some say it's just a part of it,
445.745	we've got to fulfill the book.
450.151	Won't you help to sing
455.229	these songs of freedom?
