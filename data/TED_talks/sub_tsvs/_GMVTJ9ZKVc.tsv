12.86	As a kid I always loved information
15.739	that I could get from data
17.587	and the stories that could be told with numbers.
20.629	I remember, growing up, I'd be frustrated at
22.913	how my own parents would lie to me using numbers.
28.459	"""Talithia, if I've told you once "
28.459	"I've told you a thousand times."""
33.443	No dad, you've only told me 17 times
37.335	and twice it wasn't my fault. (Laughter)
40.497	I think that is one of the reasons I got a Ph.D. in statistics.
43.661	I always wanted to know,
44.569	what are people trying to hide with numbers?
47.755	As a statistician,
48.938	I want people to show me the data
52.791	so I can decide for myself.
55.126	Donald and I were pregnant with our third child
58.175	and we were at about 41 and a half weeks,
60.909	what some of you may refer to as being overdue.
64.286	Statisticians, we call that
66.121	being within the 95 percent confidence interval.
68.807	(Laughter)
70.673	And at this point in the process
72.951	we had to come in every couple of days
75.144	to do a stress test on the baby,
76.952	and this is just routine,
78.134	it tests whether or not the baby 
78.134	is feeling any type of undue stress.
82.72	And you are rarely, if ever, seen by your actual doctor,
86.113	just whoever happens to be 
86.113	working at the hospital that day.
89.28	So we go in for a stress test and after 20 minutes
92.026	the doctor comes out and he says,
95.524	"""Your baby is under stress, we need to induce you."""
101.079	Now, as a statistician, what's my response?
105.698	Show me the data!
109.37	So then he proceeds to tell us
112.072	the baby's heart rate trace went from 18 minutes,
114.497	the baby's heart rate was in the normal zone
116.468	and for two minutes it was in what appeared to be
119.421	my heart rate zone and I said,
123.131	"""Is it possible that maybe this was my heart rate?"
125.497	I was moving around a little bit,
127.492	it's hard to lay still on your back,
132.308	"Maybe it was shifting around."""
134.481	"He said, ""Well, we don't want to take any chances."""
139.457	I said okay.
140.717	"I said, ""What if I was at 36 weeks"
142.436	with this same data?
144.245	"Would your decision be to induce?"""
148.124	"""Well, no, I would wait until you were at least"
153.702	there is no reason to leave that baby inside,
155.709	"let's get you a room."""
157.66	"I said, ""Well, why don't we just do it again?"
164.241	We can collect more data.
165.962	I can try to be really still for 20 minutes.
168.373	We can average the two and see
171.056	what that means. (Laughter)
173.738	And he goes,
177.385	"""Ma'am, I just don't want you to have a miscarriage."""
184.434	That makes three of us.
187.566	And then he says,
188.72	"""Your chances of having a miscarriage double"
192.838	"when you go past your due date. Let's get you a room."""
196.605	Wow. So now as a statistician, what's my response?
202.892	Show me the data!
204.24	Dude, you're talking chances,
205.445	I do chances all day long, tell me all about chances.
207.701	Let's talk chances. (Laughter)
209.523	Let's talk chances.
211.488	"So I say, ""Okay, great."
212.689	Do I go from a 30-percent 
212.689	chance to a 60-percent chance?
216.59	Where are we here with this miscarriage thing?
219.141	"And he goes, ""Not quite, but it doubles,"
222.437	"and we really just want what's best for the baby."""
227.419	Undaunted, I try a different angle.
229.582	"I said, ""Okay, out of 1,000 full-term pregnant women,"
235.089	how many of them are going to miscarry
237.616	just before their due date?
239.411	And then he looks at me and looks at Donald,
242.259	and he goes, about one in 1,000.
246.962	"I said, ""Okay, so of those 1,000 women, how many"
249.792	"are going to miscarry just after their due date?"""
254.65	"""About two."" (Laughter)"
258.222	"I said, ""Okay, so you are telling me that my chances"
260.266	go from a 0.1-percent chance
264.213	"to a 0.2-percent chance."""
268.459	Okay, so at this point the data is not convincing us
270.757	that we need to be induced,
272.385	and so then we proceed to have a conversation
274.334	about how inductions lead to a higher rate
276.982	of Cesarean sections, and if at all 
276.982	possible we'd like to avoid that.
280.973	And then I said,
282.225	"""And I really don't think my due date is accurate."""
285.105	(Laughter)
287.705	And so this really stunned him
290.445	and he looked sort of puzzled
292.095	"and I said, ""You may not know this,"
294.227	but pregnancy due dates are calculated
295.808	assuming that you have a standard 28-day cycle,
298.346	and my cycle ranges —
299.748	sometimes it's 27, sometimes it's up to 38 —
303.295	and I have been collecting the data to prove it.
306.449	(Laughter)
310.233	And so we ended up leaving the hospital 
310.233	that day without being induced.
316.07	We actually had to sign a waiver 
316.07	to walk out of the hospital.
322.263	And I'm not advocating that you not listen to your doctors,
325.951	because even with our first child,
327.869	we were induced at 38 weeks; cervical fluid was low.
331.511	I'm not anti-medical intervention.
333.969	But why were confident to leave that day?
336.833	Well, we had data that told a different story.
340.483	We had been collecting data for six years.
345.491	I had this temperature data,
347.789	and it told a different story.
349.064	In fact, we could probably pretty 
349.064	accurately estimate conception.
356.477	Yeah, that's a story you want to tell
358.379	at your kid's wedding reception. (Laughter)
361.631	I remember like it was yesterday.
365.324	My temperature was a sizzling 97.8 degrees
367.965	as I stared into your father's eyes. (Laughter)
372.119	Oh, yeah. Twenty-two more years, we're telling that story.
378.931	But we were confident to leave 
378.931	because we had been collecting data.
381.984	Now, what does that data look like?
383.59	Here's a standard chart
386.427	of a woman's waking body temperature
389.729	during the course of a cycle.
391.246	So from the beginning of the menstrual cycle
392.699	till the beginning of the next.
394.051	You'll see that the temperature is not random.
396.872	Clearly there is a low pattern
398.936	at the beginning of her cycle
400.935	and then you see this jump and then a higher
403.434	set of temperatures at the end of her cycle.
405.712	So what's happening here?
407.133	What is that data telling you?
409.739	Well, ladies, at the beginning of our cycle,
412.438	the hormone estrogen is dominant and that estrogen
415.78	causes a suppression of your body temperature.
419.589	And at ovulation, your body releases an egg
423.126	and progesterone takes over, pro-gestation.
428.141	And so your body heats up in anticipation
430.493	of housing this new little fertilized egg.
434.279	So why this temperature jump?
437.011	Well, think about when a bird sits on her eggs.
440.687	Why is she sitting on them?
442.153	She wants to keep them warm,
444.09	protect them and keep them warm.
445.594	Ladies, this is exactly what our bodies do every month,
447.865	they heat up in anticipation
449.956	of keeping a new little life warm.
453.092	And if nothing happens, if you are not pregnant,
456.022	then estrogen takes back over and 
456.022	that cycle starts all over again.
460.564	But if you do get pregnant, sometimes you
462.511	actually see another shift in your temperatures
465.055	and it stays elevated for those whole nine months.
468.342	That's why you see those pregnant 
468.342	women just sweating and hot,
471.667	because their temperatures are high.
475.045	Here's a chart that we had about three or four years ago.
479.414	We were really very excited about this chart.
481.434	You'll see the low temperature level
483.97	and then a shift and for about five days,
487.012	that's about the time it takes for the egg to travel
489.471	down the fallopian tube and implant,
491.918	and then you see those temperatures 
491.918	start to go up a little bit.
495.559	And in fact, we had a second temperature shift,
498.772	confirmed with a pregnancy test 
498.772	that were indeed pregnant
502.832	with our first child, very exciting.
505.913	Until a couple of days later
507.944	I saw some spotting and then I noticed heavy blood flow,
512.885	and we had in fact had an early stage miscarriage.
517.244	Had I not been taking my temperature
521.114	I really would have just thought 
521.114	my period was late that month,
525.012	but we actually had data to show
526.82	that we had miscarried this baby,
529.447	and even though this data revealed a really
531.28	unfortunate event in our lives,
533.064	it was information that we could then take to our doctor.
535.531	So if there was a fertility issue or some problem,
538.159	I had data to show:
539.414	Look, we got pregnant, our temperature shifted,
541.761	we somehow lost this baby.
543.445	What is it that we can do to help prevent this problem?
546.805	And it's not just about temperatures
550.326	and it's not just about fertility;
553.067	we can use data about our bodies to tell us a lot of things.
556.955	For instance, did you know that taking 
556.955	your temperature can tell you a lot
560.785	about the condition of your thyroid?
562.924	So, your thyroid works a lot like 
562.924	the thermostat in your house.
566.939	There is an optimal temperature 
566.939	that you want in your house;
569.157	you set your thermostat.
570.681	When it gets too cold in the house,
570.681	your thermostat kicks in
573.175	"and says, ""Hey, we need to blow some heat around."""
576.393	Or if it gets too hot, your thermostat
578.062	"registers, ""Turn the A.C. on. Cool us off."""
581.619	That's exactly how your thyroid works in your body.
585.416	Your thyroid tries to keep an optimal temperature
588.116	for your body.
589.144	If it gets too cold, your thyroid 
589.144	"says, ""Hey, we need to heat up."""
591.626	If it gets too hot, your thyroid cools you down.
594.814	But what happens when your 
594.814	thyroid is not functioning well?
599.22	When it doesn't function, then it shows up
601.587	in your body temperatures,
602.773	they tend to be lower than normal or very erratic.
605.428	And so by collecting this data
606.698	you can find out information about your thyroid.
609.685	Now, what is it, if you had a thyroid 
609.685	problem and you went to the doctor,
613.249	your doctor would actually test the amount of
615.682	thyroid stimulating hormone in your blood.
618.62	Fine. But the problem with that test is
622.803	it doesn't tell you how active the hormone is in your body.
625.568	So you might have a lot of hormone present,
627.617	but it might not be actively working to regulate
629.365	your body temperature.
630.613	So just by collecting your temperature every day,
632.362	you get information about the condition of your thyroid.
635.982	So, what if you don't want to take 
635.982	your temperature every day?
638.463	I advocate that you do,
640.021	but there are tons of other things you could take.
641.876	You could take your blood pressure, 
641.876	you could take your weight —
644.681	yeah, who's excited about
646.271	taking their weight every day? (Laughter)
649.808	Early on in our marriage, Donald had a stuffy nose
654.599	and he had been taking a slew of medications
657.719	to try to relieve his stuffy nose, to no avail.
661.718	And so, that night he comes and 
661.718	he wakes me up and he says,
665.957	"""Honey, I can't breath out of my nose."""
669.764	And I roll over and I look, and I said, 
669.764	"""Well, can you breath out of your mouth?"""
674.582	(Laughter)
676.06	"And he goes, ""Yes, but I can't breath out of my nose!"""
683.14	And so like any good wife, I rush him
686.16	to the emergency room
687.995	at 2 o'clock in the morning.
690.427	And the whole time I'm driving and I'm thinking,
693.897	you can't die on me now.
696.746	We just got married,
698.916	people will think I killed you! (Laughter)
703.374	And so, we get to the emergency 
703.374	room, and the nurse sees us,
707.047	and he can't breath out of his nose, and so
709.668	she brings us to the back and the doctor says,
711.751	"""What seems to be the problem?"" and "
711.751	"he goes, ""I can't breath out of my nose."""
714.94	"And he said, ""You can't breath out of your nose?"
716.989	No, but he can breath out of his mouth. (Laughter)
722.866	He takes a step back and he looks at both of us
725.508	"and he says ""Sir, I think I know the problem."
729.374	You're having a heart attack.
730.81	I'm going to order an EKG and a CAT scan
732.861	"for you immediately."""
736.203	And we are thinking,
737.831	no, no, no. It's not a heart attack. He can breathe,
740.771	just out of his mouth. No, no, no, no, no.
745.768	And so we go back and forth with this doctor
748.031	because we think this is the incorrect diagnosis,
750.509	"and he's like, ""No really, it'll be fine, just calm down."""
754.461	And I'm thinking, how do you calm down? 
754.461	But I don't think he's having a heart attack.
758.38	And so fortunately for us, this 
758.38	doctor was at the end of the shift.
761.621	So this new doctor comes in, he sees us clearly
764.536	distraught, with a husband who can't breath
767.537	out of his nose. (Laughter)
770.639	And he starts asking us questions.
773.425	"He says, ""Well, do you two exercise?"""
778.305	We ride our bikes, we go to the gym occasionally.
785.378	(Laughter)
787.031	We move around.
789.896	"And he says, ""What were you doing "
789.896	"just before you came here?"""
792.559	I'm thinking, I was sleeping, honestly.
795.271	But okay, what was Donald doing just before?
798.102	So Donald goes into this slew 
798.102	of medications he was taking.
801.65	"He lists, ""I took this decongestant "
801.65	"and then I took this nasal spray,"""
804.612	and then all of a sudden a lightbulb goes off and he says,
806.615	"""Oh! You should never mix this "
806.615	decongestant with this nasal spray.
810.242	"Clogs you up every time. Here, take this one instead."""
813.059	He gives us a prescription.
815.325	We're looking at each other, and I looked at the doctor,
817.315	"and I said, ""Why is it that it seems like you"
819.541	were able to accurately diagnose his condition,
821.952	but this previous doctor wanted to order
824.168	"an EKG and a CAT scan?"""
826.674	And he looks at us and says,
829.281	"""Well, when a 350-pound man walks in the "
829.281	emergency room and says he can't breath,
833.499	you assume he's having a heart attack
835.263	"and you ask questions later."""
839.212	Now, emergency room doctors are 
839.212	trained to make decisions quickly,
844.932	but not always accurately.
847.023	And so had we had some information
848.572	about our heart health to share with him,
850.966	maybe we would have gotten a 
850.966	better diagnosis the first time.
854.741	I want you to consider the following chart,
856.973	of systolic blood pressure measurements
858.927	from October 2010 to July 2012.
862.999	You'll see that these measurements start
864.692	in the prehypertension/hypertension zone,
868.36	but over about the course of a year and a half
870.946	they move into the normal zone.
873.591	This is about the heart rate of a healthy 16-year-old.
877.7	What story is this data telling you?
881.731	Obviously it's the data from someone
884.612	who's made a drastic transformation,
887.285	and fortunately for us, that person 
887.285	happens to be here today.
892.443	So that 350-pound guy that walked 
892.443	into the emergency room with me
896.697	is now an even sexier and healthier
906.357	So over the course of that year and a half
909.818	Donald's eating changed
911.387	and our exercise regimen changed,
913.378	and his heart rate responded,
916.168	his blood pressure responded to that change
917.67	that he made in his body.
919.969	So what's the take-home message
921.947	that I want you to leave with today?
925.661	By taking ownership of your data just like we've done,
930.035	just by taking this daily measurements about yourself,
933.982	you become the expert on your body.
936.491	You become the authority.
938.493	It's not hard to do.
940.916	You don't have to have a Ph.D. in statistics
942.836	to be an expert in yourself.
944.168	You don't have to have a medical degree
945.609	to be your body's expert.
947.735	Medical doctors, they're experts on the population,
951.154	but you are the expert on yourself.
953.432	And so when two of you come together,
955.342	when two experts come together,
957.312	the two of you are able to make a better decision
960.107	than just your doctor alone.
962.107	Now that you understand the power of information
965.874	that you can get through personal data collection,
967.745	I'd like you all to stand and raise your right hand.
971.414	(Laughter)
973.973	Yes, get it up.
978.771	I challenge you to take ownership of your data.
985.679	And today, I hereby confer upon you
989.241	a TEDx associate's degree in elementary statistics
993.586	with a concentration in time-dependent data analysis
998.03	with all the rights and privileges appertaining thereto.
1001.743	And so the next time you are in your doctor's office,
1005.219	as newly inducted statisticians,
1008.41	what should always be your response?
1010.92	Audience: Show me the data! 
1010.92	Talithia Williams: I can't hear you!
1012.752	Audience: Show me the data!
1014.52	TW: One more time!
1015.828	Audience: Show me the data!
1017.367	TW: Show me the data.
1018.549	Thank you.
1021.57	(Applause)
