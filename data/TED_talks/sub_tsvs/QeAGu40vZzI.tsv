12.285	I'm going to talk about hackers.
14.359	And the image that comes to your mind
16.279	when I say that word is probably not
18.738	of Benjamin Franklin,
20.255	but I'm going to explain to you why it should be.
23.443	The image that comes to your mind
24.92	is probably more likely of a pasty kid
27.606	sitting in a basement doing something mischievous,
30.122	or of a shady criminal who is
30.122	trying to steal your identity,
34.257	or of an international rogue
37.28	with a political agenda.
39.991	And mainstream culture has kind of fed this idea
44.524	that hackers are people that we should be afraid of.
49.033	But like most things in technology
50.665	and the technology world,
52.114	hacking has equal power for good as it has for evil.
55.289	For every hacker that's trying to steal your identity
57.723	there's one that's building a tool
59.961	that will help you find your
59.961	loved ones after a disaster
63.092	or to monitor environmental quality
66.571	after an oil spill.
69.308	Hacking is really just any amateur innovation
73.18	on an existing system,
74.576	and it is a deeply democratic activity.
77.406	It's about critical thinking.
78.805	It's about questioning existing ways of doing things.
81.839	It's the idea that if you see a 
81.839	problem, you work to fix it,
85.227	and not just complain about it.
87.258	And in many ways, hacking is what built America.
91.168	Betsy Ross was a hacker.
93.313	The Underground Railroad was a brilliant hack.
96.508	And from the Wright brothers to Steve Jobs,
99.384	hacking has always been at the foundation
101.923	of American democracy.
104.975	So if there's one thing I want
104.975	to leave you here with today,
109.276	it's that the next time you
109.276	think about who a hacker is,
111.847	you think not of this guy
115.869	but of this guy, Benjamin Franklin,
118.449	who was one of the greatest hackers of all time.
121.407	He was one of America's most prolific inventors,
123.548	though he famously never filed a patent,
125.73	because he thought that all human knowledge
127.324	should be freely available.
129.952	He brought us bifocals and the lightning rod,
132.984	and of course there was his collaboration
135.181	on the invention of American democracy.
138.146	And in Code For America, we really try to embody
140.469	the spirit of Ben Franklin.
142.487	He was a tinkerer and a statesman
145.929	whose conception of citizenship
147.789	was always predicated on action.
149.876	He believed that government could be built
152.661	by the people,
154.301	and we call those people civic hackers.
158.85	So it's no wonder that the values
161.305	that underly a healthy democracy,
163.973	like collaboration and empowerment
166.966	and participation and enterprise,
169.029	are the same values that underly the Internet.
172.515	And so it's no surprise that many hackers
174.611	are turning their attention to
174.611	the problem of government.
177.968	But before I give you a few examples
180.021	of what civic hacking looks like,
181.843	I want to make clear that you don't have
183.359	to be a programmer to be a civic hacker.
185.453	You just have to believe that you can bring
187.208	a 21st-century tool set to bear
189.475	on the problems that government faces.
191.914	And we hear all the time from our community
193.959	of civic hackers at Code for America
196.247	that they didn't understand
196.247	how much nontechnical work
198.855	actually went into civic hacking projects.
200.881	So keep that in mind.
202.372	All of you are potential civic hackers.
206.462	So what does civic hacking look like?
208.482	Our team last year in Honolulu,
210.746	which in this case was three full-time fellows
213.361	who were doing a year of public service,
215.513	were asked by the city to rebuild the website.
219.478	And it's a massive thing of
219.478	tens of thousands of pages
222.557	which just wasn't going to be possible
224.673	in the few months that they had.
226.426	So instead, they decided to build a parallel site
228.883	that better conformed to how citizens actually
231.345	want to interact with information on a city website.
234.684	They're looking for answers to questions,
236.621	and they want to take action when they're done,
239.247	which is really hard to do from a site
241.533	that looks like this.
243.182	So our team built Honolulu Answers,
245.427	which is a super-simple search interface
247.793	where you enter a search term or a question
250.246	and get back plain language answers
252.944	that drive a user towards action.
255.384	Now the site itself was easy enough to build,
258.241	but the team was faced with the challenge
260.144	of how they populate all of the content.
262.854	It would have taken the three of them
264.53	a very long time,
265.907	especially given that none of 
265.907	them are actually from Honolulu.
268.906	And so they did something that's really radical,
270.981	when you think about how government
272.654	is used to working.
274.695	They asked citizens to write the content.
277.707	So you've heard of a hack-a-thon.
279.201	They held a write-a-thon,
280.865	where on one Saturday afternoon --
283.502	"(""What do I do about wild pigs "
283.502	"being a nuisance?"") (Laughter) â€”"
285.543	Wild pigs are a huge problem 
285.543	in Honolulu, apparently.
289.589	In one Saturday afternoon,
291.632	they were able to populate most of the content
293.966	for most of the frequently asked questions,
295.627	but more importantly than that,
297.86	they created a new way for citizens 
297.86	to participate in their government.
301.975	Now, I think this is a really cool story in and of itself,
305.02	but it gets more awesome.
307.357	On the National Day of Civic Hacking
309.963	this past June in Oakland, where I live,
312.374	the Code For America team in Oakland
314.403	took the open source code base of Honolulu Answers
316.603	and turned it into Oakland Answers,
318.614	and again we held a write-a-thon
320.693	where we took the most frequently asked questions
324.041	and had citizens write the answers to them,
325.703	and I got into the act.
327.172	I authored this answer, and a few others.
330.773	And I'm trying to this day to articulate
333.885	the sense of empowerment and responsibility
336.931	that I feel for the place that I live
340.511	based simply on this small act of participation.
344.553	And by stitching together my small act
348.278	with the thousands of other
348.278	small acts of participation
351.084	that we're enabling through civic hacking,
353.665	we think we can reenergize citizenship
356.449	and restore trust in government.
359.499	At this point, you may be wondering
360.836	what city officials think of all this.
362.562	They actually love it.
364.115	As most of you guys know, cities are being asked
366.309	every day to do more with less,
369.03	and they're always looking for innovative solutions
371.228	to entrenched problems.
372.962	So when you give citizens a way to participate
376.496	beyond attending a town hall meeting,
378.334	cities can actually capture
380.286	the capacity in their communities
383.04	to do the business of government.
386.075	Now I don't want to leave the impression
388.068	that civic hacking is just an American phenomenon.
390.18	It's happening across the globe,
391.883	and one of my favorite examples
393.536	is from Mexico City, where earlier this year,
395.967	the Mexico House of Representatives
398.077	entered into a contract with
398.077	a software development firm
402.389	to build an app that legislators would use
405.569	to track bills.
406.82	So this was just for the handful of legislators
409.496	in the House.
412.07	And the contract was a two-year contract
414.739	for 9.3 million dollars.
418.665	Now a lot of people were really angry about this,
421.017	especially geeks who knew that 9.3 million dollars
423.964	was an absolutely outrageous amount of money
426.268	for what was a very simple app.
428.239	But instead of taking to the streets,
430.668	they issued a challenge.
432.876	They asked programmers in Mexico
435.707	to build something better and cheaper,
438.91	and they offered a prize of 9,300 dollars --
445.262	than the government contract,
446.91	and they gave the entrants 10 days.
450.013	And in those 10 days,
451.825	they submitted 173 apps,
455.886	five of which were presented to Congress
458.52	and are still in the app store today.
460.621	And because of this action,
462.442	that contract was vacated,
464.57	and now this has sparked a movement in Mexico City
466.702	which is home to one of our partners,
468.459	Code for Mexico City.
470.917	And so what you see in all three of these places,
473.668	in Honolulu and in Oakland and in Mexico City,
476.485	are the elements that are
476.485	at the core of civic hacking.
479.676	It's citizens who saw things
479.676	that could be working better
482.699	and they decided to fix them,
484.63	and through that work, they're creating
486.289	a 21st-century ecosystem of participation.
489.48	They're creating a whole new set of ways
491.51	for citizens to be involved,
493.516	besides voting or signing a petition or protesting.
497.461	They can actually build government.
501.438	So back to our friend Ben Franklin,
504.574	who, one of his lesser-known accomplishments
507.32	was that in 1736 he founded
511.195	the first volunteer firefighting
511.195	company in Philadelphia,
514.753	called a brigade.
516.452	And it's because he and his friends noticed
518.678	that the city was having trouble keeping up
520.377	with all the fires that were happening in the city,
522.447	so in true civic hacker fashion,
525.236	they built a solution.
527.886	And we have our own brigades at Code for America
530.396	working on the projects that I've just described,
533.542	and we want to ask you
535.28	to follow in Ben Franklin's footsteps
537.742	and come join us.
539.209	We have 31 brigades in the U.S.
541.499	We are pleased to announce today
542.767	that we're opening up the 
542.767	brigade to international cities
545.043	for the first time,
546.635	starting with cities in Poland and Japan and Ireland.
550.616	You can find out if there's a brigade where you live
552.715	at brigade.codeforamerica.org,
555.209	and if there's not a brigade
555.209	where you live, we will help you.
557.648	We've created a tool kit which also lives
559.504	at brigade.codeforamerica.org,
561.068	and we will support you along the way.
563.608	Our goal is to create a global
563.608	network of civic hackers
567.523	who are innovating on the existing system
570.276	in order to build tools that will solve
573.236	entrenched problems,
575.102	that will support local government,
577.129	and that will empower citizens.
578.688	So please come hack with us.
581.063	Thank you.
582.611	(Applause)
