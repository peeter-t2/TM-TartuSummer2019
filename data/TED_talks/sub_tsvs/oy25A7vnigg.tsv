108.763	So I was born and raised
110.385	in the shadow of a shipyard
113.272	in a little town on the northeast coast of England.
117.288	Some of my earliest memories
119.306	are of giant ships
121.284	blocking the end of my street,
124.014	as well as the sun, for a lot of the year.
127.059	Every morning as a child,
129.016	I'd watch thousands of men walk down that hill
132.121	to work in the shipyard.
134.219	I'd watch those same men
135.951	walking back home every night.
138.651	It has to be said, the shipyard was not
140.543	the most pleasant place to live next door to,
144.319	or indeed work in.
146.419	The shipyard was noisy, dangerous,
149.895	highly toxic,
151.911	with an appalling health and safety record.
155.407	Despite that, the men and women
158.575	who worked on those ships
160.225	were extraordinarily proud of the work they did,
163.117	and justifiably so.
165.117	Some of the largest vessels
166.651	ever constructed on planet Earth
168.579	were built right at the end of my street.
172.379	My grandfather had been a shipwright,
175.44	and as a child,
176.777	as there were few other jobs in the town,
178.649	I would wonder with some anxiety
181.213	whether that would be my destiny too.
184.371	I was fairly determined that it wouldn't be.
187.443	I had other dreams,
189.087	not necessarily practical ones,
191.589	but at the age of eight,
193.575	I was bequeathed a guitar.
196.367	It was a battered old thing
197.783	with five rusty strings, and was out of tune,
201.391	but quickly I learned to play it
203.839	and realized that I'd found a friend for life,
209.037	an accomplice, a co-conspirator
211.703	in my plan to escape from this surreal
215.587	industrial landscape.
218.275	Well, they say if you dream something hard enough,
220.357	it will come to pass.
222.097	Either that, or I was extremely lucky,
224.133	but this was my dream.
226.247	I dreamt I would leave this town,
227.929	and just like those ships,
229.481	once they were launched, I'd never come back.
232.669	I dreamt I'd become a writer of songs,
236.265	that I would sing those songs
237.643	to vast numbers of people all over the world,
240.561	that I would be paid extravagant amounts of money,
244.71	that I'd become famous,
246.915	that I'd marry a beautiful woman,
249.607	have children, raise a family,
252.247	buy a big house in the country,
254.231	keep dogs, grow wine,
256.951	have rooms full of Grammy Awards,
258.961	platinum discs, and what have you.
262.257	So far, so good, right? (Laughter)
266.871	And then one day, the songs stopped coming,
271.061	and while you've suffered from periods
273.978	of writer's block before, albeit briefly,
276.99	this is something chronic.
278.927	Day after day, you face a blank page,
281.061	and nothing's coming.
282.697	And those days turned to
282.697	weeks, and weeks to months,
284.969	and pretty soon those months
286.562	have turned into years
287.793	with very little to show for your efforts. No songs.
292.612	So you start asking yourself questions.
295.123	What have I done to offend the gods
297.296	that they would abandon me so?
300.863	Is the gift of songwriting taken away
303.599	as easily as it seems to have been bestowed?
306.856	Or perhaps there's a more --
308.889	a deeper psychological reason.
310.989	It was always a Faustian pact anyway.
314.004	You're rewarded for revealing
316.231	your innermost thoughts,
318.243	your private emotions on the page
320.07	for the entertainment of others,
321.82	for the analysis, the scrutiny of others,
327.141	and perhaps you've given enough
329.19	of your privacy away.
331.183	And yet, if you look at your work,
335.433	could it be argued that your best work
337.704	wasn't about you at all,
339.092	it was about somebody else?
341.893	Did your best work occur
343.98	when you sidestepped your own ego
347.125	and you stopped telling your story,
348.625	but told someone else's story,
350.447	someone perhaps without a voice,
353.023	where empathetically, you stood in his shoes
355.551	for a while or saw the world through his eyes?
359.1	Well they say, write what you know.
363.077	If you can't write about yourself anymore,
364.8	then who do you write about?
367.413	So it's ironic that the landscape
370.262	I'd worked so hard to escape from,
372.627	and the community that I'd more or less abandoned
374.917	and exiled myself from
377.086	should be the very landscape,
379.087	the very community I would have to return to
382.167	to find my missing muse.
385.447	And as soon as I did that,
387.591	as soon as I decided to honor the community
389.95	I came from and tell their story,
393.336	that the songs started to come thick and fast.
396.77	I've described it as a kind of projectile vomiting,
402.603	a torrent of ideas, of characters, of voices,
408.525	of verses, couplets, entire songs
411.847	almost formed whole,
414.359	materialized in front of me
416.019	as if they'd been bottled up inside me
417.943	for many, many years.
419.917	One of the first things I wrote was just a list of names
422.412	of people I'd known,
424.341	and they become characters
425.643	in a kind of three-dimensional drama,
427.98	where they explain who they are, what they do,
431.34	their hopes and their fears for the future.
435.399	This is Jackie White.
436.709	He's the foreman of the shipyard.
440.553	My name is Jackie White,
442.209	and I'm foreman of the yard,
443.981	and you don't mess with Jackie on this quayside.
446.579	I'm as hard as iron plate,
448.499	woe betide you if you're late
450.519	when we have to push a boat out on the spring tide.
453.513	Now you can die and hope for heaven,
455.449	but you need to work your shift,
457.611	and I'd expect you all to back us to the hilt,
460.211	for if St. Peter at his gate
462.385	were to ask you why you're late,
464.2	why, you tell him that you had to get a ship built.
467.37	We build battleships and cruisers
468.969	for Her Majesty the Queen,
470.765	supertankers for Onassis,
470.765	and all the classes in between,
474.378	We built the greatest ship in tonnage
476.677	what the world has ever seen
480.253	♪ And the only life worth knowing is in the shipyard ♪
484.01	♪ Steel in the stockyard, iron in the soul ♪
487.067	♪ Would conjure up a ship ♪
488.83	♪ Where there used to be a hull ♪

497.261	♪ For the only life worth knowing is in the shipyard ♪
502.557	(Applause)
507.425	So having decided to write about other people
510.787	instead of myself,
513.712	a further irony is that sometimes you reveal
515.639	more about yourself than you'd ever intended.
518.109	"This song is called ""Dead Man's Boots,"""
519.825	which is an expression
520.989	which describes how difficult it is to get a job;
523.771	in other words, you'd only get a job in the shipyard
526.07	if somebody else died.
528.193	Or perhaps your father could finagle you
530.807	an apprenticeship at the age of 15.
534.199	But sometimes a father's love can be misconstrued
536.681	as controlling,
538.544	and conversely, the scope of his son's ambition
541.636	can seem like some pie-in-the-sky fantasy.

734.601	So whenever they'd launch a big ship,
739.238	they would invite some dignitary up from London
741.98	on the train to make a speech,
743.358	break a bottle of champagne over the bows,
746.063	launch it down the slipway
747.722	into the river and out to sea.
749.845	Occasionally on a really important ship,
752.282	they'd get a member of the royal family to come,
754.462	Duke of Edinburgh, Princess Anne or somebody.
757.581	And you have to remember, it wasn't that long ago
760.493	that the royal family in England
762.618	were considered to have magical healing powers.
766.801	Sick children were held up in crowds
768.617	to try and touch the cloak
770.862	of the king or the queen to cure them
772.306	of some terrible disease.
775.081	It wasn't like that in my day,
775.081	but we still got very excited.
779.04	So it's a launch day, it's a Saturday,
781.008	and my mother has dressed
781.008	me up in my Sunday best.
783.295	I'm not very happy with her.
785.97	All the kids are out in the street,
787.544	and we have little Union Jacks to wave,
790.316	and at the top of the hill,
792.372	there's a motorcycle cortege appears.
795.09	In the middle of the motorcycles,
796.557	there's a big, black Rolls-Royce.
799.252	Inside the Rolls-Royce is the Queen Mother.
801.847	This is a big deal.
803.912	So the procession is moving
805.924	at a stately pace down my street,
807.954	and as it approaches my house,
810.244	I start to wave my flag vigorously,
812.785	and there is the Queen Mother.
814.512	I see her, and she seems to see me.
818.22	She acknowledges me. She waves, and she smiles.
820.97	And I wave my flag even more vigorously.
823.533	We're having a moment,
824.944	me and the Queen Mother.
826.658	She's acknowledged me.
828.502	And then she's gone.
831.541	Well, I wasn't cured of anything.
835.664	It was the opposite, actually.
837.268	I was infected.
840.592	I was infected with an idea.
843.199	I don't belong in this street.
845.916	I don't want to live in that house.
848.544	I don't want to end up in that shipyard.
851.619	I want to be in that car. (Laughter)
855.026	I want a bigger life.
856.99	I want a life beyond this town.
859.534	I want a life that's out of the ordinary.
863.518	It's my right.
864.832	It's my right as much as hers.
867.694	And so here I am at TED,
872.293	I suppose to tell that story,
874.828	and I think it's appropriate to say the obvious
879.402	that there's a symbiotic and intrinsic link
883.692	between storytelling and community,
886.922	between community and art,
889.118	between community and science and technology,
892.132	between community and economics.
894.898	It's my belief that
898.286	abstract economic theory
900.335	that denies the needs of community
903.109	or denies the contribution that community makes
906.28	to economy is shortsighted, cruel
910.219	and untenable.
912.827	(Applause)
916.583	The fact is, whether you're a rock star
919.479	or whether you're a welder in a shipyard,
923.099	or a tribesman in the upper Amazon,
926.359	or the queen of England,
