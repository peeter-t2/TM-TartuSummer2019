13.015	What do you think when you look at me?
16	A woman of faith? An expert?
19.145	Maybe even a sister.
21.391	Or oppressed,
23.702	brainwashed,
25.237	a terrorist.
28.061	Or just an airport security line delay.
32.571	That one's actually true.
34.104	(Laughter)
35.684	If some of your perceptions were negative,
35.684	I don't really blame you.
38.931	That's just how the media
38.931	has been portraying
41.075	people who look like me.
42.629	One study found
44.059	that 80 percent of news coverage
44.059	about Islam and Muslims is negative.
48.828	And studies show that Americans
48.828	say that most don't know a Muslim.
53.088	I guess people don't talk
53.088	to their Uber drivers.
55.968	(Laughter)
59.365	Well, for those of you
59.365	who have never met a Muslim,
62.988	it's great to meet you.
65.738	Let me tell you who I am.
68.731	I'm a mom, a coffee lover --
71.858	double espresso, cream on the side.
74.103	I'm an introvert.
76.089	I'm a wannabe fitness fanatic.
78.12	And I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslim.
83.788	But not like Lady Gaga says,
83.788	because baby, I wasn't born this way.
88.931	It was a choice.
91.64	When I was 17, I decided to come out.
95.679	No, not as a gay person
95.679	like some of my friends,
98.864	but as a Muslim,
100.388	and decided to start wearing
100.388	the hijab, my head covering.
104.216	My feminist friends were aghast:
107.771	"""Why are you oppressing yourself?"""
111.436	The funny thing was,
112.992	it was actually at that time
112.992	a feminist declaration of independence
118.898	from the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old,
122.88	to conform to a perfect
122.88	and unattainable standard of beauty.
127.582	I didn't just passively accept
127.582	the faith of my parents.
132.658	I wrestled with the Quran.
134.888	I read and reflected
134.888	and questioned and doubted
140.428	and, ultimately, believed.
143.621	My relationship with God --
143.621	it was not love at first sight.
149.614	It was a trust and a slow surrender
152.512	that deepened with every
152.512	reading of the Quran.
156.133	Its rhythmic beauty
156.133	sometimes moves me to tears.
160.909	I see myself in it.
160.909	I feel that God knows me.
165.069	Have you ever felt like someone sees you,
165.069	completely understands you
170.685	and yet loves you anyway?
172.923	That's how it feels.
175.773	And so later, I got married,
178.477	and like all good Egyptians,
180.365	started my career as an engineer.
182.848	(Laughter)
186.602	I later had a child,
186.602	after getting married,
191.603	and I was living essentially
191.603	the Egyptian-American dream.
198.448	And then that terrible morning
198.448	of September, 2001.
204.417	I think a lot of you probably remember
204.417	exactly where you were that morning.
211.181	I was sitting in my kitchen
211.181	finishing breakfast,
214.912	and I look up on the screen
214.912	"and see the words ""Breaking News."""
219.075	There was smoke,
219.075	airplanes flying into buildings,
222.49	people jumping out of buildings.
225.277	What was this?
227.456	An accident?
229.786	A malfunction?
233.084	My shock quickly turned to outrage.
236.55	Who would do this?
239.385	And I switch the channel and I hear,
242.111	"""... Muslim terrorist ...,"""
244.191	"""... in the name of Islam ...,"""
246.212	"""... Middle-Eastern descent ...,"""
248.585	"""... jihad ...,"""
250.42	"""... we should bomb Mecca."""
252.294	Oh my God.
255.232	Not only had my country been attacked,
259.08	but in a flash,
260.446	somebody else's actions
260.446	had turned me from a citizen
264.376	to a suspect.
267.021	That same day, we had to drive
267.021	across Middle America
271.982	to move to a new city
271.982	to start grad school.
276.908	And I remember sitting
276.908	in the passenger seat
279.015	as we drove in silence,
281.871	crouched as low as I could go in my seat,
284.481	for the first time in my life,
284.481	afraid for anyone to know I was a Muslim.
290.943	We moved into our apartment
290.943	that night in a new town
294.11	in what felt like
294.11	a completely different world.
297.928	And then I was hearing
297.928	and seeing and reading
301.906	warnings from national
301.906	Muslim organizations
304.627	saying things like,
304.627	"""Be alert,"" ""Be aware,"""
308.312	"""Stay in well-lit areas,"""
308.312	"""Don't congregate."""
312.18	I stayed inside all week.
314.988	And then it was Friday that same week,
317.756	the day that Muslims
317.756	congregate for worship.
322.035	And again the warnings were,
322.035	"""Don't go that first Friday,"
326.625	"it could be a target."""
329.512	And I was watching the news,
329.512	wall-to-wall coverage.
332.187	Emotions were so raw, understandably,
335.076	and I was also hearing
335.076	about attacks on Muslims,
338.778	or people who were perceived
338.778	to be Muslim, being pulled out
341.62	and beaten in the street.
342.866	Mosques were actually firebombed.
345.004	And I thought, we should just stay home.
347.777	And yet, something didn't feel right.
351.335	Because those people
351.335	who attacked our country
353.792	attacked our country.
358.611	I get it that people were angry
358.611	at the terrorists.
361.441	Guess what? So was I.
364.897	And so to have to explain yourself
364.897	all the time isn't easy.
370.193	I don't mind questions. I love questions.
373.582	It's the accusations that are tough.
376.583	Today we hear people actually
376.583	saying things like,
380.278	"""There's a problem in this country,"
380.278	and it's called Muslims.
383.108	"When are we going to get rid of them?"""
385.504	So, some people want to ban Muslims
385.504	and close down mosques.
389.197	They talk about my community
389.197	kind of like we're a tumor
392.279	in the body of America.
393.944	And the only question is,
393.944	are we malignant or benign?
397.866	You know, a malignant tumor
397.866	you extract altogether,
400.871	and a benign tumor
400.871	you just keep under surveillance.
407.467	The choices don't make sense,
407.467	because it's the wrong question.
411.893	Muslims, like all other Americans,
411.893	aren't a tumor in the body of America,
415.818	we're a vital organ.
418.109	(Applause)
419.134	Thank you.
420.317	(Applause)
425.937	Muslims are inventors and teachers,
428.527	first responders and Olympic athletes.
432.341	Now, is closing down mosques
432.341	going to make America safer?
436.194	It might free up some parking spots,
439.294	but it will not end terrorism.
442.134	Going to a mosque regularly
442.134	is actually linked
444.611	to having more tolerant views
444.611	of people of other faiths
448.541	and greater civic engagement.
451.561	And as one police chief
451.561	in the Washington, DC area
454.866	recently told me,
456.041	people don't actually
456.041	get radicalized at mosques.
458.925	They get radicalized in their basement
458.925	or bedroom, in front of a computer.
464.526	And what you find
464.526	about the radicalization process
467.38	is it starts online,
469.027	but the first thing that happens
470.622	is the person gets cut off
470.622	from their community,
473.64	from even their family,
475.306	so that the extremist group
475.306	can brainwash them
478.098	into believing that they,
478.098	the terrorists, are the true Muslims,
482.42	and everyone else who abhors
482.42	their behavior and ideology
486.46	are sellouts or apostates.
489.607	So if we want to prevent radicalization,
491.886	we have to keep people
491.886	going to the mosque.
496.765	Now, some will still argue
496.765	Islam is a violent religion.
500.517	After all, a group like ISIS
500.517	bases its brutality on the Quran.
506.318	Now, as a Muslim, as a mother,
506.318	as a human being,
509.676	I think we need to do everything we can
509.676	to stop a group like ISIS.
515.72	But we would be giving in
515.72	to their narrative
520.624	if we cast them as representatives
520.624	of a faith of 1.6 billion people.
526.373	(Applause)
529.89	Thank you.
533.809	ISIS has as much to do with Islam
537.117	as the Ku Klux Klan has to do
537.117	with Christianity.
540.491	(Applause)
546.795	Both groups claim to base
546.795	their ideology on their holy book.
552.349	But when you look at them,
552.349	they're not motivated
555.397	by what they read in their holy book.
557.705	It's their brutality that makes them
557.705	read these things into the scripture.
564.098	Recently, a prominent imam
564.098	told me a story that really took me aback.
567.772	He said that a girl came to him
569.535	because she was thinking
569.535	of going to join ISIS.
572.556	And I was really surprised and asked him,
574.628	had she been in contact
574.628	with a radical religious leader?
577.898	And he said the problem
577.898	was quite the opposite,
580.217	that every cleric that she had
580.217	talked to had shut her down
583.968	and said that her rage,
583.968	her sense of injustice in the world,
587.589	was just going to get her in trouble.
589.698	And so with nowhere to channel
589.698	and make sense of this anger,
593.403	she was a prime target to be exploited
595.442	by extremists promising her a solution.
598.605	What this imam did was to connect her
598.605	back to God and to her community.
603.319	He didn't shame her for her rage --
603.319	instead, he gave her constructive ways
608.19	to make real change in the world.
610.751	What she learned at that mosque
610.751	prevented her from going to join ISIS.
616.983	I've told you a little bit
618.262	about how Islamophobia
618.262	affects me and my family.
621.076	But how does it impact ordinary Americans?
623.64	How does it impact everyone else?
625.569	How does consuming fear 24 hours a day
625.569	affect the health of our democracy,
631.359	the health of our free thought?
633.527	Well, one study -- actually,
633.527	several studies in neuroscience --
637.422	show that when we're afraid,
637.422	at least three things happen.
641.857	We become more accepting
641.857	of authoritarianism,
646.002	conformity and prejudice.
649.194	One study showed that when subjects
649.194	were exposed to news stories
655.005	that were negative about Muslims,
658.013	they became more accepting
658.013	of military attacks on Muslim countries
662.152	and policies that curtail the rights
662.152	of American Muslims.
666.192	Now, this isn't just academic.
668.373	When you look at when
668.373	anti-Muslim sentiment spiked
673.555	between 2001 and 2013,
677.127	it happened three times,
678.718	but it wasn't around terrorist attacks.
681.294	It was in the run up to the Iraq War
681.294	and during two election cycles.
686.155	So Islamophobia isn't just
686.155	the natural response to Muslim terrorism
690.723	as I would have expected.
693.218	It can actually be a tool
693.218	of public manipulation,
697.72	eroding the very foundation
697.72	of a free society,
701.727	which is rational
701.727	and well-informed citizens.
706.605	Muslims are like canaries
706.605	in the coal mine.
709.655	We might be the first to feel it,
711.37	but the toxic air of fear
711.37	is harming us all.
716.251	(Applause)
723.58	And assigning collective guilt
726.003	isn't just about having
726.003	to explain yourself all the time.
729.777	Deah and his wife Yusor
729.777	were a young married couple
733.449	living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina,
735.472	where they both went to school.
737.686	Deah was an athlete.
740.125	He was in dental school,
740.125	talented, promising ...
744.26	And his sister would tell me
744.26	that he was the sweetest,
748.502	most generous human being she knew.
750.561	She was visiting him there
750.561	and he showed her his resume,
754.439	and she was amazed.
755.725	"She said, ""When did my baby brother"
755.725	"become such an accomplished young man?"""
761.119	Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit
761.119	to her brother and his new wife,
766.237	their neighbor,
768.732	Craig Stephen Hicks,
770.897	murdered them,
772.666	as well as Yusor's sister, Razan,
772.666	who was visiting for the afternoon,
777.471	in their apartment,
779.754	execution style,
781.533	after posting anti-Muslim statements
781.533	on his Facebook page.
786.058	He shot Deah eight times.
789.254	So bigotry isn't just immoral,
789.254	it can even be lethal.
794.355	So, back to my story.
795.7	What happened after 9/11?
797.424	Did we go to the mosque
797.424	or did we play it safe and stay home?
801.39	Well, we talked it over,
803.296	and it might seem like
803.296	a small decision, but to us,
806.009	it was about what kind of America
806.009	we wanted to leave for our kids:
809.889	one that would control us by fear
813.293	or one where we were practicing
813.293	our religion freely.
816.811	So we decided to go to the mosque.
819.823	And we put my son in his car seat,
821.59	buckled him in, and we drove silently,
821.59	intensely, to the mosque.
825.305	I took him out, I took off my shoes,
825.305	I walked into the prayer hall
830.609	and what I saw made me stop.
833.271	The place was completely full.
835.492	And then the imam made an announcement,
837.704	thanking and welcoming our guests,
842.564	because half the congregation
845.833	were Christians, Jews,
845.833	Buddhists, atheists,
848.585	people of faith and no faith,
851.029	who had come not to attack us,
851.029	but to stand in solidarity with us.
856.419	(Applause)
865.599	I just break down at this time.
868.674	These people were there because they chose
868.674	courage and compassion
873.242	over panic and prejudice.
876.731	What will you choose?
879.122	What will you choose
879.122	at this time of fear and bigotry?
885.397	Will you play it safe?
887.914	Or will you join those who say
890.237	we are better than that?
892.249	Thank you.
893.424	(Applause)
907.91	Thank you so much.
912.497	Helen Walters: So Dalia,
912.497	you seem to have struck a chord.
916.865	But I wonder,
918.426	what would you say to those
918.426	who might argue
920.909	that you're giving a TED Talk,
922.69	you're clearly a deep thinker,
924.269	you work at a fancy think tank,
926.3	you're an exception, you're not the rule.
928.437	What would you say to those people?
930.841	Dalia Mogahed: I would say,
930.841	don't let this stage distract you,
933.787	I'm completely ordinary.
935.821	I'm not an exception.
937.447	My story is not unusual.
939.491	I am as ordinary as they come.
942.498	When you look at Muslims
942.498	around the world --
946.72	and I've done this, I've done
946.72	the largest study ever done
949.575	on Muslims around the world --
951.141	people want ordinary things.
952.615	They want prosperity for their family,
954.464	they want jobs
955.639	and they want to live in peace.
957.269	So I am not in any way an exception.
960.339	When you meet people who seem
960.339	like an exception to the rule,
963.214	oftentimes it's that the rule is broken,
966.292	not that they're an exception to it.
968.536	HW: Thank you so much.
968.536	Dalia Mogahed.
971.02	(Applause)
