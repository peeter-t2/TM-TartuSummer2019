16.769	So a friend of mine who's a political scientist,
19.085	he told me several months ago
20.688	exactly what this month would be like.
22.756	He said, you know, there's this fiscal cliff coming,
25.67	it's going to come at the beginning of 2013.
29.276	Both parties absolutely need to resolve it,
32.036	but neither party wants to be seen as the first to resolve it.
34.861	Neither party has any incentive to solve it a second before it's due,
39.078	so he said, December, you're just going to see lots of
41.698	angry negotiations, negotiations breaking apart,
44.918	reports of phone calls that aren't going well,
47.667	people saying nothing's happening at all,
49.829	and then sometime around Christmas or New Year's,
52.375	"we're going to hear, ""Okay, they resolved everything."""
54.983	He told me that a few months ago. He said he's 98 percent positive they're going to resolve it,
59.571	and I got an email from him today saying, all right,
62.005	we're basically on track, but now I'm 80 percent positive
65.984	that they're going to resolve it.
67.66	And it made me think. I love studying
70.204	these moments in American history
72.197	when there was this frenzy of partisan anger,
76.097	that the economy was on the verge of total collapse.
79.238	The most famous early battle was Alexander Hamilton
83.478	and Thomas Jefferson over what the dollar would be
87.039	and how it would be backed up, with Alexander Hamilton
89.36	"saying, ""We need a central bank, the First Bank of the United States,"
92.604	or else the dollar will have no value.
94.403	"This economy won't work,"""
96.028	"and Thomas Jefferson saying, ""The people won't trust that."
98.437	"They just fought off a king. They're not going to accept some central authority."""
102.225	This battle defined the first 150 years of the U.S. economy,
107.747	and at every moment, different partisans saying,
111.397	"""Oh my God, the economy's about to collapse,"""
113.585	and the rest of us just going about, spending our bucks
115.734	on whatever it is we wanted to buy.
118.958	To give you a quick primer on where we are,
121.691	a quick refresher on where we are.
123.47	So the fiscal cliff, I was told
126.034	that that's too partisan a thing to say,
128.5	although I can't remember which party it's supporting or attacking.
131.922	People say we should call it the fiscal slope,
134.283	or we should call it an austerity crisis,
136.329	but then other people say, no, that's even more partisan.
138.715	So I just call it the self-imposed, self-destructive
141.492	arbitrary deadline about resolving an inevitable problem.
146.189	And this is what the inevitable problem looks like.
149.816	So this is a projection of U.S. debt as a percentage
154.174	of our overall economy, of GDP.
156.536	The light blue dotted line represents
159.904	the Congressional Budget Office's best guess
162.033	of what will happen if Congress really doesn't do anything,
166.108	and as you can see, sometime around 2027,
169.624	we reach Greek levels of debt,
171.912	somewhere around 130 percent of GDP,
174.8	which tells you that some time in the next 20 years,
178.16	if Congress does absolutely nothing,
180.53	we're going to hit a moment where the world's investors,
184.204	the world's bond buyers, are going to say,
185.805	"""We don't trust America anymore. We're not going to lend them any money,"
188.595	"except at really high interest rates."""
190.634	And at that moment our economy collapses.
193.5	But remember, Greece is there today.
195.349	We're there in 20 years. We have lots and lots of time
199.251	to avoid that crisis,
201.472	and the fiscal cliff was just one more attempt
205.167	at trying to force the two sides to resolve the crisis.
208.704	Here's another way to look at exactly the same problem.
212.112	The dark blue line is how much the government spends.
215.056	The light blue line is how much the government gets in.
218.513	And as you can see, for most of recent history,
221.273	except for a brief period, we have consistently spent
224.905	more than we take in. Thus the national debt.
228.105	But as you can also see, projected going forward,
231.984	the gap widens a bit and raises a bit,
235	and this graph is only through 2021.
237.049	It gets really, really ugly out towards 2030.
240.712	And this graph sort of sums up what the problem is.
244.837	The Democrats, they say, well, this isn't a big deal.
247.926	We can just raise taxes a bit and close that gap,
252.044	especially if we raise taxes on the rich.
254.3	The Republicans say, hey, no, no, we've got a better idea.
256.923	Why don't we lower both lines?
258.362	Why don't we lower government spending and lower government taxes,
262.317	and then we'll be on an even more favorable
265.766	long-term deficit trajectory?
268.245	And behind this powerful disagreement between
272.824	how to close that gap,
274.604	there's the worst kind of cynical party politics,
277.989	the worst kind of insider baseball, lobbying, all of that stuff,
283.362	but there's also this powerfully interesting,
287.623	respectful disagreement between
290.056	two fundamentally different economic philosophies.
293.583	And I like to think, when I picture how Republicans
298.406	see the economy, what I picture is just some amazingly
303.537	well-engineered machine, some perfect machine.
306.848	Unfortunately, I picture it made in Germany or Japan,
311.326	but this amazing machine that's constantly scouring
314.179	every bit of human endeavor and taking resources,
319.275	money, labor, capital, machinery,
321.624	away from the least productive parts and towards the more productive parts,
325.874	and while this might cause temporary dislocation,
327.47	what it does is it builds up the more productive areas
330.964	and lets the less productive areas fade away and die,
333.594	and as a result the whole system is so much more efficient,
336.37	so much richer for everybody.
338.708	And this view generally believes that there is a role for government,
342.621	a small role, to set the rules so people aren't lying
345.441	and cheating and hurting each other,
347.69	maybe, you know, have a police force and a fire department
350.994	and an army, but to have a very limited reach
353.994	into the mechanisms of this machinery.
356.994	And when I picture how Democrats and Democratic-leaning
361.17	economists picture this economy,
364.138	most Democratic economists are, you know, they're capitalists,
366.694	they believe, yes, that's a good system a lot of the time.
369.434	It's good to let markets move resources to their more productive use.
373.554	But that system has tons of problems.
377.47	Wealth piles up in the wrong places.
379.799	Wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproductive.
384.073	That's not going to create an equitable, fair society.
386.941	That machine doesn't care about the environment,
389.813	about racism, about all these issues
391.879	that make this life worse for all of us,
394.677	and so the government does have a role to take resources
397.756	from more productive uses, or from richer sources,
401.037	and give them to other sources.
403.705	And when you think about the economy through these two different lenses,
408.76	you understand why this crisis is so hard to solve,
412.818	because the worse the crisis gets, the higher the stakes are,
416.807	the more each side thinks they know the answer
419.575	and the other side is just going to ruin everything.
422.928	And I can get really despairing. I've spent a lot
426.063	of the last few years really depressed about this,
429.126	until this year, I learned something that
432.175	I felt really excited about. I feel like it's really good news,
435.655	and it's so shocking, I don't like saying it, because I think
438.516	people won't believe me.
440.021	But here's what I learned.
441.339	The American people, taken as a whole,
443.759	when it comes to these issues, to fiscal issues,
446.959	are moderate, pragmatic centrists.
450.682	And I know that's hard to believe, that the American people
452.947	are moderate, pragmatic centrists.
454.38	But let me explain what I'm thinking.
456.961	When you look at how the federal government spends money,
460.258	so this is the battle right here,
465.525	Medicare, Medicaid, a few other health programs,
470.912	and six percent interest.
472.818	So when we're talking about cutting government spending,
477.536	this is the pie we're talking about,
479.542	and Americans overwhelmingly, and it doesn't matter
483.129	what party they're in, overwhelmingly like
486.662	that big 55 percent chunk.
489.101	They like Social Security. They like Medicare.
491.093	They even like Medicaid, even though that goes to the poor and indigent,
494.621	which you might think would have less support.
497.045	And they do not want it fundamentally touched,
500.996	although the American people are remarkably comfortable,
505.187	and Democrats roughly equal to Republicans,
508.099	with some minor tweaks to make the system more stable.
512.864	Social Security is fairly easy to fix.
515.625	The rumors of its demise are always greatly exaggerated.
519.409	So gradually raise Social Security retirement age,
521.703	maybe only on people not yet born.
524.076	Americans are about 50/50,
526.501	whether they're Democrats or Republicans.
528.497	Reduce Medicare for very wealthy seniors,
530.849	seniors who make a lot of money. Don't even eliminate it. Just reduce it.
534.17	People generally are comfortable with it, Democrats and Republicans.
539.185	Raise medical health care contributions?
541.492	Everyone hates that equally, but Republicans
543.921	and Democrats hate that together.
546.593	And so what this tells me is, when you look at
549.707	the discussion of how to resolve our fiscal problems,
553.537	we are not a nation that's powerfully divided on the major, major issue.
560.922	We're comfortable with it needing some tweaks, but we want to keep it.
564.203	We're not open to a discussion of eliminating it.
566.998	Now there is one issue that is hyper-partisan,
571.284	and where there is one party that is just spend, spend, spend,
574.766	we don't care, spend some more,
576.649	and that of course is Republicans
578.555	when it comes to military defense spending.
580.535	They way outweigh Democrats.
583.03	The vast majority want to protect military defense spending.
587.825	That's 20 percent of the budget,
590.046	and that presents a more difficult issue.
593.729	I should also note that the [discretionary] spending,
596.654	which is about 19 percent of the budget,
598.788	that is Democratic and Republican issues,
601.158	so you do have welfare, food stamps, other programs
603.526	that tend to be popular among Democrats,
605.56	but you also have the farm bill and all sorts of Department of Interior
608.525	inducements for oil drilling and other things,
611.47	which tend to be popular among Republicans.
615.085	Now when it comes to taxes, there is more disagreement.
618.409	That's a more partisan area.
620.273	You have Democrats overwhelmingly supportive
623.667	of raising the income tax on people who make 250,000 dollars a year,
627.716	Republicans sort of against it, although if you break it out by income,
632.956	Republicans who make less than 75,000 dollars a year like this idea.
637.649	So basically Republicans who make more than 250,000 dollars a year don't want to be taxed.
642.004	Raising taxes on investment income, you also see
645.26	about two thirds of Democrats but only one third of Republicans
648.124	are comfortable with that idea.
651.923	This brings up a really important point, which is that
654.948	we tend in this country to talk about Democrats
657.564	and Republicans and think there's this little group
659.375	over there called independents that's, what, two percent?
661.74	If you add Democrats, you add Republicans,
663.852	you've got the American people.
665.346	But that is not the case at all.
668.292	And it has not been the case for most of modern American history.
673.437	Roughly a third of Americans say that they are Democrats.
677.254	Around a quarter say that they are Republicans.
680.103	A tiny little sliver call themselves libertarians, or socialists,
684.583	or some other small third party,
687.27	and the largest block, 40 percent, say they're independents.
692.477	So most Americans are not partisan,
695.398	and most of the people in the independent camp
697.566	fall somewhere in between, so even though we have
701.257	tremendous overlap between the views on these fiscal issues
704.817	of Democrats and Republicans,
707.113	we have even more overlap when you add in the independents.
710.905	Now we get to fight about all sorts of other issues.
714.145	We get to hate each other on gun control
716.258	and abortion and the environment,
718.538	but on these fiscal issues, these important fiscal issues,
721.41	we just are not anywhere nearly as divided as people say.
725.242	And in fact, there's this other group of people
727.274	who are not as divided as people might think,
730.612	and that group is economists.
732.625	I talk to a lot of economists, and back in the '70s
737.928	and '80s it was ugly being an economist.
741.026	You were in what they called the saltwater camp,
744.201	meaning Harvard, Princeton, MIT, Stanford, Berkeley,
748.815	or you were in the freshwater camp, University of Chicago,
751.783	University of Rochester.
753.235	You were a free market capitalist economist
756.231	or you were a Keynesian liberal economist,
758.364	and these people didn't go to each other's weddings,
760.539	they snubbed each other at conferences.
762.431	It's still ugly to this day, but in my experience,
765.44	it is really, really hard to find an economist under 40
769.041	who still has that kind of way of seeing the world.
773.065	The vast majority of economists -- it is so uncool
776.017	to call yourself an ideologue of either camp.
778.858	The phrase that you want, if you're a graduate student
781.379	or a postdoc or you're a professor,
783.906	"a 38-year-old economics professor, is, ""I'm an empiricist."
786.883	"I go by the data."""
788.427	And the data is very clear.
790.831	None of these major theories have been completely successful.
794.852	The 20th century, the last hundred years,
796.5	is riddled with disastrous examples
799.451	of times that one school or the other tried to explain
803.123	the past or predict the future
805.443	and just did an awful, awful job,
807.329	so the economics profession has acquired some degree of modesty.
812.518	They still are an awfully arrogant group of people, I will assure you,
816.112	but they're now arrogant about their impartiality,
818.989	and they, too, see a tremendous range of potential outcomes.
825.78	And this nonpartisanship is something that exists,
830.88	that has existed in secret
832.619	in America for years and years and years.
834.335	I've spent a lot of the fall talking to the three major
838.299	organizations that survey American political attitudes:
842.195	Pew Research,
843.749	the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center,
847.397	and the most important but the least known
850.245	is the American National Election Studies group
853.22	that is the world's longest, most respected poll of political attitudes.
857.566	They've been doing it since 1948,
859.528	and what they show consistently throughout
863.015	is that it's almost impossible to find Americans
867.462	who are consistent ideologically,
870.623	"who consistently support, ""No we mustn't tax,"
874.359	"and we must limit the size of government,"""
877.039	"or, ""No, we must encourage government to play a larger role"
880.739	"in redistribution and correcting the ills of capitalism."""
884.735	Those groups are very, very small.
886.613	The vast majority of people, they pick and choose,
889.609	they see compromise and they change over time
892.173	when they hear a better argument or a worse argument.
894.706	And that part of it has not changed.
898.067	What has changed is how people respond to vague questions.
902.02	If you ask people vague questions, like,
904.618	"""Do you think there should be more government or less government?"""
907.61	"""Do you think government should"" — especially if you use loaded language --"
911.924	"""Do you think the government should provide handouts?"""
914.403	"Or, ""Do you think the government should redistribute?"""
916.332	Then you can see radical partisan change.
918.933	But when you get specific, when you actually ask
921.627	about the actual taxing and spending issues under consideration,
925.667	people are remarkably centrist,
928.275	they're remarkably open to compromise.
931.14	So what we have, then, when you think about the fiscal cliff,
934.925	don't think of it as the American people fundamentally
939.451	can't stand each other on these issues
941.627	and that we must be ripped apart
943.182	into two separate warring nations.
945.504	Think of it as a tiny, tiny number of ancient economists
951.43	and misrepresentative ideologues have captured the process.
955.276	And they've captured the process through familiar ways,
957.852	through a primary system which encourages
960.804	that small group of people's voices,
963.036	because that small group of people,
965.141	the people who answer all yeses or all noes
968.213	on those ideological questions,
970.62	they might be small but every one of them has a blog,
973.227	every one of them has been on Fox or MSNBC in the last week.
976.981	Every one of them becomes a louder and louder voice,
980.134	but they don't represent us.
982.266	They don't represent what our views are.
985.367	And that gets me back to the dollar,
987.173	and it gets me back to reminding myself that
990.398	we know this experience.
992.408	We know what it's like
994.053	to have these people on TV, in Congress,
999.408	yelling about how the end of the world is coming
1002.135	if we don't adopt their view completely,
1005.361	because it's happened about the dollar
1007.355	ever since there's been a dollar.
1009.358	We had the battle between Jefferson and Hamilton.
1013.252	In 1913, we had this ugly battle over the Federal Reserve,
1017.922	when it was created, with vicious, angry arguments
1021.796	over how it would be constituted,
1023.668	and a general agreement that the way it was constituted
1025.445	was the worst possible compromise,
1028.352	a compromise guaranteed to destroy this valuable thing,
1031.712	this dollar, but then everyone agreeing, okay,
1034.069	so long as we're on the gold standard, it should be okay.
1036.58	The Fed can't mess it up so badly.
1038.63	But then we got off the gold standard for individuals
1042.767	during the Depression and we got off the gold standard
1045.181	as a source of international currency coordination
1049.279	during Richard Nixon's presidency.
1051.511	Each of those times, we were on the verge of complete collapse.
1055.484	And nothing happened at all.
1057.638	Throughout it all, the dollar has been
1059.576	one of the most long-standing,
1061.884	stable, reasonable currencies,
1064.019	and we all use it every single day,
1066.186	no matter what the people screaming about tell us,
1069.211	no matter how scared we're supposed to be.
1072.255	And this long-term fiscal picture that we're in right now,
1076.2	I think what is most maddening about it is,
1080.129	if Congress were simply able
1084.068	to show not that they agree with each other,
1086.441	not that they're able to come up with the best possible compromise,
1089.721	but that they are able to just begin the process
1092.803	towards compromise, we all instantly are better off.
1097.284	The fear is that the world is watching.
1101.418	The fear is that the longer we delay any solution,
1104.875	the more the world will look to the U.S.
1106.663	not as the bedrock of stability in the global economy,
1110.283	but as a place that can't resolve its own fights,
1113.858	and the longer we put that off, the more we make the world nervous,
1117.684	the higher interest rates are going to be,
1119.467	the quicker we're going to have to face a day
1122.171	of horrible calamity.
1124.278	And so just the act of compromise itself,
1127.842	and sustained, real compromise,
1129.743	would give us even more time,
1131.557	would allow both sides even longer to spread out the pain
1134.519	and reach even more compromise down the road.
1137.154	So I'm in the media. I feel like my job to make this happen
1140.266	is to help foster the things that seem to lead to compromise,
1144.559	to not talk about this in those vague and scary terms
1148.671	that do polarize us,
1150.232	but to just talk about it like what it is,
1152.841	not an existential crisis,
1154.784	not some battle between two fundamentally different religious views,
1159.757	but a math problem, a really solvable math problem,
1162.359	one where we're not all going to get what we want
1164.435	and one where, you know, there's going to be a little pain to spread around.
1168.39	But the more we address it as a practical concern,
1171.905	the sooner we can resolve it,
1173.416	and the more time we have to resolve it, paradoxically.
1176.883	Thank you. (Applause)
