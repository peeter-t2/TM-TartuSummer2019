12.876	So, when I was in art school,
14.665	I developed a shake in my hand,
16.084	and this was the straightest line I could draw.
19.116	Now in hindsight, it was actually good for some things,
21.767	like mixing a can of paint or shaking a Polaroid,
24.956	but at the time this was really doomsday.
27.654	This was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist.
31.271	The shake developed out of, really,
33.641	a single-minded pursuit of pointillism,
35.548	just years of making tiny, tiny dots.
38.102	And eventually these dots went from being perfectly round
41.996	to looking more like tadpoles, because of the shake.
45.684	So to compensate, I'd hold the pen tighter,
47.929	and this progressively made the shake worse,
50.244	so I'd hold the pen tighter still.
52.516	And this became a vicious cycle that ended up
54.732	causing so much pain and joint issues,
56.956	I had trouble holding anything.
59.172	And after spending all my life wanting to do art,
62.557	I left art school, and then I left art completely.
67.168	But after a few years, I just couldn't stay away from art,
69.628	and I decided to go to a neurologist about the shake
71.92	and discovered I had permanent nerve damage.
74.78	And he actually took one look at my squiggly line,
77.509	"and said, ""Well, why don't you just embrace the shake?"""
80.932	So I did. I went home, I grabbed a pencil,
83.542	and I just started letting my hand shake and shake.
85.45	I was making all these scribble pictures.
87.544	And even though it wasn't the kind of art
89.374	that I was ultimately passionate about, it felt great.
93.03	And more importantly, once I embraced the shake,
95.509	I realized I could still make art.
97.884	I just had to find a different approach
99.154	to making the art that I wanted.
101.507	Now, I still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism,
104.347	seeing these little tiny dots come together
106.176	to make this unified whole.
108.157	So I began experimenting with other ways to fragment images
111.108	where the shake wouldn't affect the work,
113.286	like dipping my feet in paint and walking on a canvas,
117.763	or, in a 3D structure consisting of two-by-fours,
121.461	creating a 2D image by burning it with a blowtorch.
126.924	I discovered that, if I worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials,
130.268	my hand really wouldn't hurt,
132.676	and after having gone from a single approach to art,
136.276	I ended up having an approach to creativity
138.527	that completely changed my artistic horizons.
142.228	This was the first time I'd encountered this idea
144.148	that embracing a limitation could actually drive creativity.
149.62	At the time, I was finishing up school,
152.036	and I was so excited to get a real job and finally afford new art supplies.
155.644	I had this horrible little set of tools, and I felt like
159.405	I could do so much more with the supplies
161.515	I thought an artist was supposed to have.
164.047	I actually didn't even have a regular pair of scissors.
166.252	I was using these metal shears until I stole a pair
168.764	from the office that I worked at.
171.012	So I got out of school, I got a job, I got a paycheck,
173.944	I got myself to the art store,
175.598	and I just went nuts buying supplies.
178.712	And then when I got home, I sat down
180.34	and I set myself to task to really try to create something
183.448	just completely outside of the box.
186.212	But I sat there for hours, and nothing came to mind.
190.636	The same thing the next day, and then the next,
193.183	quickly slipping into a creative slump.
196.872	And I was in a dark place for a long time, unable to create.
201.12	And it didn't make any sense, because I was finally able
203.694	to support my art, and yet I was creatively blank.
208.068	But as I searched around in the darkness,
210.28	I realized I was actually paralyzed by all of the choices
213.808	that I never had before.
216.376	And it was then that I thought back to my jittery hands.
220.099	Embrace the shake.
222.816	And I realized, if I ever wanted my creativity back,
225.492	I had to quit trying so hard to think outside of the box
229.256	and get back into it.
231.972	I wondered, could you become more creative, then,
234.058	by looking for limitations?
236.956	What if I could only create with a dollar's worth of supplies?
242.137	At this point, I was spending a lot of my evenings in --
244.41	well, I guess I still spend a lot of my evenings in Starbucks —
247.183	but I know you can ask for an extra cup if you want one,
250.391	so I decided to ask for 50.
252.784	Surprisingly, they just handed them right over,
254.567	and then with some pencils I already had,
256.555	I made this project for only 80 cents.
259.735	It really became a moment of clarification for me
262.271	that we need to first be limited
265.151	in order to become limitless.
268.199	I took this approach of thinking inside the box
270.207	to my canvas, and wondered what if, instead of
272.11	painting on a canvas, I could only paint on my chest?
275.439	So I painted 30 images, one layer at a time,
278.023	one on top of another,
279.223	with each picture representing an influence in my life.
283.723	Or what if, instead of painting with a brush,
286.375	I could only paint with karate chops? (Laughter)
289.127	So I'd dip my hands in paint,
290.603	and I just attacked the canvas,
292.023	and I actually hit so hard that I bruised a joint in my pinkie
294.732	and it was stuck straight for a couple of weeks.
297.664	(Laughter) (Applause)
301.027	Or, what if instead of relying on myself,
305.232	I had to rely on other people
307.165	to create the content for the art?
309.817	So for six days, I lived in front of a webcam.
312.608	I slept on the floor and I ate takeout,
315.248	and I asked people to call me and share a story with me
317.553	about a life-changing moment.
320.236	Their stories became the art
322.688	as I wrote them onto the revolving canvas.
326.2	(Applause)
330.665	Or what if instead of making art to display,
335.161	I had to destroy it?
337.424	This seemed like the ultimate limitation,
339.696	being an artist without art.
342.188	This destruction idea turned into a yearlong project
344.736	that I called Goodbye Art,
346.089	where each and every piece of art had to be destroyed after its creation.
350.785	In the beginning of Goodbye Art, I focused on
352.276	forced destruction, like this image of Jimi Hendrix,
355.003	made with over 7,000 matches.
357.808	(Laughter)
358.974	Then I opened it up to creating art that was destroyed naturally.
362.163	I looked for temporary materials,
364.776	like spitting out food --
366.95	(Laughter) —
371.012	sidewalk chalk
374.225	and even frozen wine.
378.761	The last iteration of destruction
380.822	was to try to produce something that didn't actually exist in the first place.
384.865	So I organized candles on a table, I lit them, and then blew them out,
388.208	then repeated this process over and over with the same set of candles,
391.848	then assembled the videos into the larger image.
395.761	So the end image was never visible as a physical whole.
400.28	It was destroyed before it ever existed.
404.122	In the course of this Goodbye Art series,
406.608	I created 23 different pieces
409.44	with nothing left to physically display.
412.752	What I thought would be the ultimate limitation
415.176	actually turned out to be the ultimate liberation,
418.104	as each time I created,
420.307	the destruction brought me back to a neutral place
422.319	where I felt refreshed and ready to start the next project.
426.604	It did not happen overnight.
428.96	There were times when my projects failed to get off the ground,
431.011	or, even worse, after spending tons of time on them
433.8	the end image was kind of embarrassing.
436.312	But having committed to the process, I continued on,
439.032	and something really surprising came out of this.
441.043	As I destroyed each project,
444.009	I was learning to let go,
446.841	let go of outcomes, let go of failures,
450.352	and let go of imperfections.
452.875	And in return, I found a process of creating art
455.304	that's perpetual and unencumbered by results.
459.529	I found myself in a state of constant creation,
461.558	thinking only of what's next
464.056	and coming up with more ideas than ever.
466.952	When I think back to my three years away from art,
469.437	away from my dream, just going through the motions,
472.688	instead of trying to find a different way to continue that dream,
476.44	I just quit, I gave up.
479.64	And what if I didn't embrace the shake?
483.256	Because embracing the shake for me
484.453	wasn't just about art and having art skills.
487.093	It turned out to be about life, and having life skills.
491.528	Because ultimately, most of what we do
494.039	takes place here, inside the box, with limited resources.
499.611	Learning to be creative within the confines of our limitations
503.28	is the best hope we have to transform ourselves
507.359	and, collectively, transform our world.
511.224	Looking at limitations as a source of creativity
515.392	changed the course of my life.
518.248	Now, when I run into a barrier
519.939	or I find myself creatively stumped,
523.048	I sometimes still struggle,
524.602	but I continue to show up for the process
526.696	and try to remind myself of the possibilities,
530.193	like using hundreds of real, live worms to make an image,
534.788	using a pushpin to tattoo a banana,
539.175	or painting a picture with hamburger grease.
545.198	(Laughter)
547.052	One of my most recent endeavors
548.659	is to try to translate the habits of creativity that I've learned
552.103	into something others can replicate.
555.287	Limitations may be the most unlikely of places
559.144	to harness creativity, but perhaps
562.538	one of the best ways to get ourselves out of ruts,
566.208	rethink categories and challenge accepted norms.
570.111	And instead of telling each other to seize the day,
573.97	maybe we can remind ourselves every day
577.933	to seize the limitation.
580.447	Thank you.
581.914	(Applause)
