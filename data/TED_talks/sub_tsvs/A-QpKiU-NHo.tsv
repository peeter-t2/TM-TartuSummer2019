15.26	I'm here to talk to you
17.26	about the economic invisibility of nature.
19.26	The bad news
21.26	is that mother nature's back office isn't working yet,
23.26	so those invoices don't get issued.
25.26	But we need to do something about this problem.
28.26	I began my life as a markets professional
31.26	and continued to take an interest,
34.26	but most of my recent effort
36.26	has been looking at the value
38.26	of what comes to human beings from nature,
40.26	and which doesn't get priced by the markets.
43.26	A project called TEEB was started in 2007,
46.26	and it was launched by a group of environment ministers
49.26	of the G8+5.
51.26	And their basic inspiration
53.26	was a stern review of Lord Stern.
55.26	They asked themselves a question:
57.26	If economics could make such a convincing case
59.26	for early action on climate change,
61.26	well why can't the same be done for conservation?
63.26	Why can't an equivalent case be made
65.26	for nature?
67.26	And the answer is: Yeah, it can.
69.26	But it's not that straightforward.
71.26	Biodiversity, the living fabric of this planet, is not a gas.
74.26	It exists in many layers,
76.26	ecosystems, species and genes across many scales --
79.26	international, national, local, community --
82.26	and doing for nature
84.26	what Lord Stern and his team did for nature is not that easy.
87.26	And yet, we began.
89.26	We began the project with an interim report,
91.26	which quickly pulled together
93.26	a lot of information that had been collected on the subject
96.26	by many, many researchers.
98.26	And amongst our compiled results
100.26	was the startling revelation
102.26	that, in fact, we were losing natural capital --
105.26	the benefits that flow from nature to us.
107.26	We were losing it at an extraordinary rate --
109.26	in fact, of the order of two to four trillion dollars-worth
112.26	of natural capital.
115.26	This came out in 2008,
117.26	which was, of course, around the time that the banking crisis had shown
119.26	that we had lost financial capital
121.26	of the order of two and a half trillion dollars.
123.26	So this was comparable in size to that kind of loss.
126.26	We then have gone on since
128.26	to present for [the] international community,
131.26	for governments,
133.26	for local governments and for business
135.26	and for people, for you and me,
137.26	a whole slew of reports, which were presented at the U.N. last year,
140.26	which address the economic invisibility of nature
143.26	and describe what can be done to solve it.
145.26	What is this about?
147.26	A picture that you're familiar with --
149.26	the Amazon rainforests.
151.26	It's a massive store of carbon, it's an amazing store of biodiversity,
154.26	but what people don't really know
156.26	is this also is a rain factory.
158.26	Because the northeastern trade winds,
160.26	as they go over the Amazonas,
162.26	effectively gather the water vapor.
164.26	Something like 20 billion tons per day of water vapor
167.26	is sucked up by the northeastern trade winds,
170.26	and eventually precipitates in the form of rain
173.26	across the La Plata Basin.
175.26	This rainfall cycle, this rainfall factory,
178.26	effectively feeds an agricultural economy
180.26	of the order of 240 billion dollars-worth
182.26	in Latin America.
184.26	But the question arises: Okay, so how much
187.26	do Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina
189.26	and indeed the state of Mato Grosso in Brazil
192.26	pay for that vital input to that economy
195.26	to the state of Amazonas, which produces that rainfall?
198.26	And the answer is zilch,
200.26	exactly zero.
202.26	That's the economic invisibility of nature.
204.26	That can't keep going on,
206.26	because economic incentives and disincentives are very powerful.
209.26	Economics has become the currency of policy.
211.26	And unless we address
213.26	this invisibility,
215.26	we are going to get the results that we are seeing,
217.26	which is a gradual degradation and loss
220.26	of this valuable natural asset.
222.26	It's not just about the Amazonas, or indeed about rainforests.
225.26	No matter what level you look at,
227.26	whether it's at the ecosystem level or at the species level or at the genetic level,
230.26	we see the same problem again and again.
233.26	So rainfall cycle and water regulation by rainforests
236.26	at an ecosystem level.
238.26	At the species level,
240.26	it's been estimated that insect-based pollination,
242.26	bees pollinating fruit and so on,
245.26	is something like 190 billion dollars-worth.
248.26	That's something like eight percent
250.26	of the total agricultural output globally.
254.26	It completely passes below the radar screen.
256.26	But when did a bee actually ever give you an invoice?
259.26	Or for that matter, if you look at the genetic level,
265.26	were found first as molecules in a rainforest or a reef.
268.26	Once again, most of that doesn't get paid.
270.26	And that brings me to another aspect of this,
272.26	which is, to whom should this get paid?
275.26	That genetic material
277.26	probably belonged, if it could belong to anyone,
279.26	to a local community of poor people
281.26	who parted with the knowledge that helped the researchers to find the molecule,
284.26	which then became the medicine.
286.26	They were the ones that didn't get paid.
288.26	And if you look at the species level,
291.26	you saw about fish.
293.26	Today, the depletion of ocean fisheries is so significant
296.26	that effectively it is effecting the ability of the poor,
300.26	the artisanal fisher folk
302.26	and those who fish for their own livelihoods,
304.26	to feed their families.
306.26	Something like a billion people depend on fish,
308.26	the quantity of fish in the oceans.
310.26	A billion people depend on fish
313.26	for their main source for animal protein.
315.26	And at this rate at which we are losing fish,
317.26	it is a human problem of enormous dimensions,
319.26	a health problem
321.26	of a kind we haven't seen before.
324.26	And finally, at the ecosystem level,
326.26	whether it's flood prevention or drought control provided by the forests,
329.26	or whether it is the ability of poor farmers
331.26	to go out and gather leaf litter
333.26	for their cattle and goats,
335.26	or whether it's the ability of their wives
337.26	to go and collect fuel wood from the forest,
339.26	it is actually the poor
341.26	who depend most on these ecosystem services.
343.26	We did estimates in our study
345.26	that for countries like Brazil, India and Indonesia,
348.26	even though ecosystem services --
350.26	these benefits that flow from nature to humanity for free --
353.26	they're not very big in percentage terms of GDP --
355.26	two, four, eight, 10, 15 percent --
357.26	but in these countries, if we measure how much they're worth to the poor,
360.26	the answers are more like
365.26	That's the difference.
367.26	Because these are important benefits for the poor.
370.26	And you can't really have a proper model for development
373.26	if at the same time you're destroying or allowing
376.26	the degradation of the very asset, the most important asset,
379.26	which is your development asset,
381.26	that is ecological infrastructure.
383.26	How bad can things get?
385.26	Well here a picture of something called the mean species abundance.
388.26	It's basically a measure
390.26	of how many tigers, toads, ticks or whatever on average
392.26	of biomass of various species are around.
395.26	The green represents the percentage.
397.26	If you start green, it's like 80 to 100 percent.
400.26	If it's yellow, it's 40 to 60 percent.
402.26	And these are percentages versus the original state, so to speak,
404.26	the pre-industrial era, 1750.
407.26	Now I'm going to show you
409.26	how business as usual will affect this.
411.26	And just watch the change in colors
413.26	in India, China, Europe,
415.26	sub-Saharan Africa
417.26	as we move on and consume global biomass
420.26	at a rate which is actually not going to be able to sustain us.
424.26	See that again.
426.26	The only places that remain green -- and that's not good news --
428.26	is, in fact, places like the Gobi Desert,
431.26	like the tundra and like the Sahara.
433.26	But that doesn't help because there were very few species
435.26	and volume of biomass there in the first place.
437.26	This is the challenge.
439.26	The reason this is happening
442.26	boils down, in my mind, to one basic problem,
445.26	which is our inability to perceive the difference
447.26	between public benefits
449.26	and private profits.
451.26	We tend to constantly ignore public wealth
454.26	simply because it is in the common wealth,
456.26	it's common goods.
458.26	And here's an example from Thailand
460.26	where we found that, because the value of a mangrove is not that much --
464.26	it's about $600 over the life of nine years that this has been measured --
468.26	compared to its value as a shrimp farm,
470.26	which is more like $9,600,
472.26	there has been a gradual trend to deplete the mangroves
475.26	and convert them to shrimp farms.
477.26	But of course, if you look at exactly what those profits are,
481.26	almost 8,000 of those dollars
483.26	are, in fact, subsidies.
485.26	So you compare the two sides of the coin
488.26	and you find that it's more like 1,200 to 600.
490.26	That's not that hard.
492.26	But on the other hand, if you start measuring,
494.26	how much would it actually cost
496.26	to restore the land of the shrimp farm
498.26	back to productive use?
500.26	Once salt deposition and chemical deposition
502.26	has had its effects,
504.26	that answer is more like $12,000 of cost.
507.26	And if you see the benefits of the mangrove
509.26	in terms of the storm protection and cyclone protection that you get
512.26	and in terms of the fisheries, the fish nurseries,
514.26	that provide fish for the poor,
516.26	that answer is more like $11,000.
518.26	So now look at the different lens.
520.26	If you look at the lens of public wealth
522.26	as against the lens of private profits,
524.26	you get a completely different answer,
526.26	which is clearly conservation makes more sense,
529.26	and not destruction.
531.26	So is this just a story from South Thailand?
534.26	Sorry, this is a global story.
536.26	And here's what the same calculation looks like,
538.26	which was done recently -- well I say recently, over the last 10 years --
541.26	by a group called TRUCOST.
543.26	And they calculated for the top 3,000 corporations,
545.26	what are the externalities?
547.26	In other words, what are the costs of doing business as usual?
549.26	This is not illegal stuff, this is basically business as usual,
552.26	which causes climate-changing emissions, which have an economic cost.
555.26	It causes pollutants being issued, which have an economic cost,
558.26	health cost and so on.
560.26	Use of freshwater.
562.26	If you drill water to make coke near a village farm,
564.26	that's not illegal, but yes, it costs the community.
566.26	Can we stop this, and how?
568.26	I think the first point to make is that we need to recognize natural capital.
571.26	Basically the stuff of life is natural capital,
574.26	and we need to recognize and build that into our systems.
577.26	When we measure GDP
579.26	as a measure of economic performance at the national level,
581.26	we don't include our biggest asset at the country level.
584.26	When we measure corporate performances,
586.26	we don't include our impacts on nature
588.26	and what our business costs society.
590.26	That has to stop.
592.26	In fact, this was what really inspired my interest in this phase.
595.26	I began a project way back called the Green Accounting Project.
597.26	That was in the early 2000s
599.26	when India was going gung-ho about GDP growth
602.26	as the means forward --
604.26	looking at China with its stellar growths of eight, nine, 10 percent
606.26	and wondering, why can we do the same?
608.26	And a few friends of mine and I
610.26	decided this doesn't make sense.
612.26	This is going to create more cost to society and more losses.
615.26	So we decided to do a massive set of calculations
617.26	and started producing green accounts for India and its states.
620.26	That's how my interests began
622.26	and went to the TEEB project.
624.26	Calculating this at the national level is one thing, and it has begun.
627.26	And the World Bank has acknowledged this
629.26	and they've started a project called WAVES --
631.26	Wealth Accounting and Valuation of Ecosystem Services.
633.26	But calculating this at the next level,
635.26	that means at the business sector level, is important.
637.26	And actually we've done this with the TEEB project.
639.26	We've done this for a very difficult case,
642.26	which was for deforestation in China.
644.26	This is important, because in China in 1997,
647.26	the Yellow River actually went dry for nine months
650.26	causing severe loss of agriculture output
652.26	and pain and loss to society.
654.26	Just a year later the Yangtze flooded,
656.26	causing something like 5,500 deaths.
659.26	So clearly there was a problem with deforestation.
661.26	It was associated largely with the construction industry.
664.26	And the Chinese government responded sensibly
666.26	and placed a ban on felling.
668.26	A retrospective on 40 years
670.26	shows that if we had accounted for these costs --
674.26	the cost of loss of topsoil,
676.26	the cost of loss of waterways,
678.26	the lost productivity, the loss to local communities
681.26	as a result of all these factors,
683.26	desertification and so on --
685.26	those costs are almost twice as much
687.26	as the market price of timber.
689.26	So in fact, the price of timber in the Beijing marketplace
692.26	ought to have been three-times what it was
694.26	had it reflected the true pain and the costs
697.26	to the society within China.
699.26	Of course, after the event one can be wise.
702.26	The way to do this is to do it on a company basis,
704.26	to take leadership forward,
706.26	and to do it for as many important sectors which have a cost,
709.26	and to disclose these answers.
711.26	"Someone once asked me, ""Who is better or worse,"
713.26	is it Unilever or is it P&amp;G
715.26	"when it comes to their impact on rainforests in Indonesia?"""
718.26	And I couldn't answer because neither of these companies,
720.26	good though they are and professional though they are,
722.26	do not calculate or disclose their externalities.
725.26	But if we look at companies like PUMA --
727.26	Jochen Zeitz, their CEO and chairman,
729.26	once challenged me at a function,
731.26	saying that he's going to implement my project before I finish it.
734.26	Well I think we kind of did it at the same time, but he's done it.
737.26	He's basically worked the cost to PUMA.
739.26	PUMA has 2.7 billion dollars of turnover,
748.26	Now that's not a happy situation for them,
750.26	but they have the confidence and the courage
752.26	"to come forward and say, ""Here's what we are measuring."
755.26	We are measuring it because we know
757.26	"that you cannot manage what you do not measure."""
759.26	That's an example, I think, for us to look at
761.26	and for us to draw comfort from.
763.26	If more companies did this,
765.26	and if more sectors engaged this as sectors,
767.26	you could have analysts, business analysts,
769.26	and you could have people like us and consumers and NGOs
772.26	actually look and compare the social performance of companies.
775.26	Today we can't yet do that, but I think the path is laid out.
778.26	This can be done.
780.26	And I'm delighted that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in the U.K.
782.26	has already set up a coalition to do this,
784.26	an international coalition.
786.26	The other favorite, if you like, solution for me
789.26	is the creation of green carbon markets.
791.26	And by the way, these are my favorites --
793.26	externalities calculation and green carbon markets.
795.26	TEEB has more than a dozen separate groups of solutions
799.26	including protected area evaluation
801.26	and payments for ecosystem services
803.26	and eco-certification and you name it, but these are the favorites.
806.26	What's green carbon?
808.26	Today what we have is basically a brown carbon marketplace.
810.26	It's about energy emissions.
812.26	The European Union ETS is the main marketplace.
814.26	It's not doing too well. We've over-issued.
816.26	A bit like inflation: you over-issue currency,
818.26	you get what you see, declining prices.
821.26	But that's all about energy and industry.
824.26	But what we're missing is also some other emissions
826.26	like black carbon, that is soot.
828.26	What we're also missing is blue carbon,
830.26	which, by the way, is the largest store of carbon --
832.26	more than 55 percent.
834.26	Thankfully, the flux, in other words, the flow of emissions
836.26	from the ocean to the atmosphere and vice versa,
838.26	is more or less balanced.
840.26	In fact, what's being absorbed
842.26	is something like 25 percent of our emissions,
845.26	which then leads to acidification
847.26	or lower alkalinity in oceans.
849.26	More of that in a minute.
851.26	And finally, there's deforestation,
853.26	and there's emission of methane
855.26	from agriculture.
857.26	Green carbon,
859.26	which is the deforestation and agricultural emissions,
861.26	and blue carbon
863.26	together comprise 25 percent of our emissions.
865.26	We have the means already in our hands,
867.26	through a structure, through a mechanism, called REDD Plus --
869.26	a scheme for the reduced emissions
871.26	from deforestation and forest degradation.
874.26	And already Norway has contributed a billion dollars each
877.26	towards Indonesia and Brazil
879.26	to implement this Red Plus scheme.
881.26	So we actually have some movement forward.
883.26	But the thing is to do a lot more of that.
885.26	Will this solve the problem? Will economics solve everything?
888.26	Well I'm afraid not.
890.26	There is an area that is the oceans, coral reefs.
893.26	As you can see,
895.26	they cut across the entire globe
897.26	all the way from Micronesia
899.26	across Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Madagascar
902.26	and to the West of the Caribbean.
904.26	These red dots, these red areas,
906.26	basically provide the food and livelihood
908.26	for more than half a billion people.
910.26	So that's almost an eighth of society.
913.26	And the sad thing is that, as these coral reefs are lost --
916.26	and scientists tell us
918.26	that any level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere above 350 parts per million
921.26	is too dangerous for the survival of these reefs --
924.26	we are not only risking the extinction
926.26	of the entire coral species, the warm water corals,
928.26	we're not only risking a fourth of all fish species which are in the oceans,
932.26	but we are risking the very lives and livelihoods
934.26	of more than 500 million people
937.26	who live in the developing world in poor countries.
940.26	So in selecting targets of 450 parts per million
943.26	and selecting two degrees at the climate negotiations,
946.26	what we have done is we've made an ethical choice.
949.26	We've actually kind of made an ethical choice in society
952.26	to not have coral reefs.
954.26	Well what I will say to you in parting
956.26	is that we may have done that.
958.26	Let's think about it and what it means,
960.26	but please, let's not do more of that.
962.26	Because mother nature only has that much
964.26	in ecological infrastructure and that much natural capital.
967.26	I don't think we can afford too much of such ethical choices.
970.26	Thank you.
972.26	(Applause)
