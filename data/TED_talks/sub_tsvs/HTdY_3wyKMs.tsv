28	Allison Hunt: My three minutes hasn't started yet, has it?
30	Chris Anderson: No, you can't start the three minutes.
32	Reset the three minutes, that's just not fair.
34	AH: Oh my God, it's harsh up here.
36	I mean I'm nervous enough as it is.
39	But I am not as nervous as I was five weeks ago.
43	Five weeks ago I had total hip replacement surgery.
46	Do you know that surgery?
48	Electric saw, power drill, totally disgusting
51	unless you're David Bolinsky, in which case it's all truth and beauty.
55	Sure David, if it's not your hip, it's truth and beauty.
59	Anyway, I did have a really big epiphany around the situation,
61	so Chris invited me to tell you about it.
63	But first you need to know two things about me.
65	Just two things.
67	I'm Canadian, and I'm the youngest of seven kids.
70	Now, in Canada, we have that great healthcare system.
72	That means we get our new hips for free.
74	And being the youngest of seven,
77	I have never been at the front of the line for anything. OK?
82	So my hip had been hurting me for years.
84	I finally went to the doctor, which was free.
87	And she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon, also free.
91	Finally got to see him after 10 months of waiting -- almost a year.
95	That is what free gets you.
99	I met the surgeon, and he took some free X-rays,
102	and I got a good look at them. And you know,
104	even I could tell my hip was bad,
106	and I actually work in marketing.
108	"So he said, ""Allison, we've got to get you on the table."
112	"I'm going to replace your hip -- it's about an 18-month wait."""
117	I'd already waited 10 months, and I had to wait 18 more months.
121	You know, it's such a long wait that I actually
123	started to even think about it in terms of TEDs.
125	I wouldn't have my new hip for this TED.
127	I wouldn't have my new hip for TEDGlobal in Africa.
130	I would not have my new hip for TED2008.
132	I would still be on my bad hip. That was so disappointing.
135	So, I left his office and I was walking through the hospital,
139	and that's when I had my epiphany.
142	This youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line.
146	Oh yeah.
148	Can I tell you how un-Canadian that is?
150	We do not think that way.
152	We don't talk about it. It's not even a consideration.
155	In fact, when we're traveling abroad, it's how we identify fellow Canadians.
159	"""After you."" ""Oh, no, no. After you."""
161	"Hey, are you from Canada? ""Oh, me too! Hi!"""
163	"""Great! Excellent!"""
166	So no, suddenly I wasn't averse to butting any geezer off the list.
170	Some 70-year-old who wanted his new hip
172	so he could be back golfing, or gardening.
174	No, no. Front of the line.
176	So by now I was walking the lobby, and of course, that hurt,
179	because of my hip, and I kind of needed a sign.
182	And I saw a sign.
185	In the window of the hospital's tiny gift shop there was a sign
189	"that said, ""Volunteers Needed."" Hmm."
193	Well, they signed me up immediately.
196	No reference checks. None of the usual background stuff, no.
199	They were desperate for volunteers
201	because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75.
205	Yeah. They needed some young blood.
208	So, next thing you know, I had my bright blue volunteer vest,
211	I had my photo ID, and I was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss.
215	I worked alone.
217	Every Friday morning I was at the gift shop.
220	While ringing in hospital staff's Tic Tacs,
223	"I'd casually ask, ""What do you do?"""
225	"Then I'd tell them, ""Well, I'm getting my hip replaced -- in 18 months."
231	"It's gonna be so great when the pain stops. Ow!"""
236	All the staff got to know the plucky, young volunteer.
243	My next surgeon's appointment was, coincidentally,
246	right after a shift at the gift shop.
248	So, naturally, I had my vest and my identification.
252	I draped them casually over the chair in the doctor's office.
254	And you know, when he walked in,
256	I could just tell that he saw them.
258	Moments later, I had a surgery date just weeks away,
262	and a big fat prescription for Percocet.
267	Now, word on the street was that it was actually
269	my volunteering that got me to the front of the line.
271	And, you know, I'm not even ashamed of that.
274	Two reasons.
275	First of all, I am going to take such good care of this new hip.
277	But also I intend to stick with the volunteering,
280	which actually leads me to the biggest epiphany of them all.
284	Even when a Canadian cheats the system,
287	they do it in a way that benefits society.
