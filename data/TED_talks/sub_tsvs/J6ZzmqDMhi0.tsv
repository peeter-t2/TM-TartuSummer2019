12.487	So in my free time outside of Twitter
15.076	I experiment a little bit
16.527	with telling stories online, experimenting
19.15	with what we can do with new digital tools.
21.573	And in my job at Twitter,
23.079	I actually spent a little bit of time
24.695	working with authors and storytellers as well,
27.439	helping to expand out the bounds
29.644	of what people are experimenting with.
31.954	And I want to talk through some examples today
34.324	of things that people have done
35.733	that I think are really fascinating
37.902	using flexible identity and anonymity on the web
41.037	and blurring the lines between fact and fiction.
45.11	But I want to start and go back to the 1930s.
47.262	Long before a little thing called Twitter,
49.573	radio brought us broadcasts
52.614	and connected millions of people
55.498	to single points of broadcast.
57.939	And from those single points emanated stories.
61.961	Some of them were familiar stories.
63.95	Some of them were new stories.
65.415	And for a while they were familiar formats,
68.414	but then radio began to evolve its own
70.635	unique formats specific to that medium.
73.566	Think about episodes that happened live on radio.
77.25	Combining the live play
79.573	and the serialization of written fiction,
81.934	you get this new format.
84.119	And the reason why I bring up radio is that I think
86.048	radio is a great example of how a new medium
90.173	defines new formats which then define new stories.
93.98	And of course, today, we have an entirely new
96.916	medium to play with,
98.517	which is this online world.
99.943	This is the map of verified users on Twitter
103.807	and the connections between them.
105.113	There are thousands upon thousands of them.
107.88	Every single one of these points
109.475	is its own broadcaster.
111.357	We've gone to this world of many to many,
115.03	where access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting.
119.795	And I think that we should start to see
122.368	wildly new formats emerge
124.053	as people learn how to tell stories in this new medium.
127.961	I actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier
131.313	for creative experimentation, if you will,
133.501	that we've explored and begun to settle
136.85	this wild land of the Internet
138.829	and are now just getting ready
141.072	to start to build structures on it,
143.154	and those structures are the new formats
145.241	of storytelling that the Internet will allow us to create.
149.794	I believe this starts with an evolution
152.099	of existing methods.
153.993	The short story, for example,
155.756	people are saying that the short story
157.218	is experiencing a renaissance of sorts
159.993	thanks to e-readers, digital marketplaces.
163.392	One writer, Hugh Howey, experimented
166.47	with short stories on Amazon
168.191	"by releasing one very short story called ""Wool."""
172.723	And he actually says that he didn't intend
175.225	"for ""Wool"" to become a series,"
176.57	but that the audience loved the first story so much
179.196	they demanded more, and so he gave them more.
181.607	"He gave them ""Wool 2,"" which was a little bit longer than the first one,"
185.111	"""Wool 3,"" which was even longer,"
187.105	"culminating in ""Wool 5,"""
188.895	which was a 60,000-word novel.
191.736	I think Howey was able to do all of this because
195.721	he had the quick feedback system of e-books.
198.664	He was able to write and publish
200.466	in relatively short order.
202.055	There was no mediator between him and the audience.
205.152	It was just him directly connected with his audience
207.958	and building on the feedback and enthusiasm
210.107	that they were giving him.
211.928	So this whole project was an experiment.
213.813	It started with the one short story,
215.92	and I think the experimentation actually became
218.049	a part of Howey's format.
220.377	And that's something that this medium enabled,
223.616	was experimentation being a part of the format itself.
227.793	This is a short story by the author Jennifer Egan
230.964	"called ""Black Box."""
232.412	It was originally written
233.919	specifically with Twitter in mind.
235.6	Egan convinced The New Yorker
237.909	to start a New Yorker fiction account
240.331	from which they could tweet
242.148	all of these lines that she created.
243.952	Now Twitter, of course, has a 140-character limit.
247.399	Egan mocked that up just writing manually
250.24	in this storyboard sketchbook,
253.156	used the physical space constraints
256.143	of those storyboard squares
257.652	to write each individual tweet,
259.453	and those tweets ended up becoming
262.392	over 600 of them that were serialized by The New Yorker.
266.08	Every night, at 8 p.m., you could tune in
269.85	to a short story from The New Yorker's fiction account.
273.418	I think that's pretty exciting:
274.962	tune-in literary fiction.
277.468	The experience of Egan's story, of course,
280.529	like anything on Twitter, there were multiple ways to experience it.
283.578	You could scroll back through it,
285.117	but interestingly, if you were watching it live,
288	there was this suspense that built
290.631	because the actual tweets,
293.148	you had no control over when you would read them.
295.451	They were coming at a pretty regular clip,
297.891	but as the story was building,
300.269	normally, as a reader, you control how fast you move through a text,
303.512	but in this case, The New Yorker did,
305.823	and they were sending you bit by bit by bit,
308.993	and you had this suspense of waiting for the next line.
312.275	Another great example of fiction
315.346	and the short story on Twitter,
317.39	"Elliott Holt is an author who wrote a story called ""Evidence."""
320.813	"It began with this tweet: ""On November 28"
323.443	at 10:13 p.m.,
325.594	a woman identified as Miranda Brown,
330.499	"from the roof of a Manhattan hotel."""
332.865	It begins in Elliott's voice,
334.595	but then Elliott's voice recedes,
336.336	and we hear the voices of Elsa, Margot and Simon,
339.718	characters that Elliott created on Twitter
342.817	specifically to tell this story,
344.546	a story from multiple perspectives
347.16	leading up to this moment at 10:13 p.m.
350.285	when this woman falls to her death.
352.563	These three characters brought an authentic vision
355.667	from multiple perspectives.
357.389	One reviewer called Elliott's story
359.715	"""Twitter fiction done right,"" because she did."
362.605	She captured that voice
364.333	and she had multiple characters and it happened in real time.
367.521	Interestingly, though, it wasn't just
370.22	Twitter as a distribution mechanism.
372.384	It was also Twitter as a production mechanism.
374.528	Elliott told me later
375.772	she wrote the whole thing with her thumbs.
379.819	She laid on the couch and just went back and forth
383.622	between different characters
385.471	tweeting out each line, line by line.
388.084	I think that this kind of spontaneous creation
390.837	of what was coming out of the characters' voices
393.353	really lent an authenticity to the characters themselves,
396.462	but also to this format that she had created
399.14	of multiple perspectives in a single story on Twitter.
403.753	As you begin to play with flexible identity online,
406.48	it gets even more interesting
407.777	as you start to interact with the real world.
409.722	Things like Invisible Obama
411.626	"or the famous ""binders full of women"""
413.867	that came up during the 2012 election cycle,
416.413	"or even the fan fiction universe of ""West Wing"" Twitter"
420.584	in which you have all of these accounts
422.694	"for every single one of the characters in ""The West Wing,"""
425.67	including the bird that taps at Josh Lyman's window
429.573	in one single episode. (Laughter)
433.709	All of these are rapid iterations on a theme.
436.845	They are creative people experimenting
439.161	with the bounds of what is possible in this medium.
442.217	"You look at something like ""West Wing"" Twitter,"
443.97	in which you have these fictional characters
446.37	that engage with the real world.
448.328	They comment on politics,
450.12	they cry out against the evils of Congress.
454.654	Keep in mind, they're all Democrats.
456.438	And they engage with the real world.
459.758	They respond to it.
461.616	So once you take flexible identity,
463.761	anonymity, engagement with the real world,
466.46	and you move beyond simple homage or parody
469.631	and you put these tools to work in telling a story,
473.22	that's when things get really interesting.
475.103	So during the Chicago mayoral election
477.912	there was a parody account.
479.48	It was Mayor Emanuel.
480.894	It gave you everything you wanted from Rahm Emanuel,
484.36	particularly in the expletive department.
487.68	This foul-mouthed account
489.759	followed the daily activities of the race,
493.646	providing commentary as it went.
495.326	It followed all of the natural tropes
497.807	of a good, solid Twitter parody account,
500.189	but then started to get weird.
503.871	And as it progressed, it moved from this commentary
507.244	to a multi-week, real-time science fiction epic
512.512	in which your protagonist, Rahm Emanuel,
515.6	engages in multi-dimensional travel on election day,
519.757	which is -- it didn't actually happen.
522.37	I double checked the newspapers.
525.788	And then, very interestingly, it came to an end.
529.331	This is something that doesn't usually happen
531.33	with a Twitter parody account.
532.791	It ended, a true narrative conclusion.
536.52	And so the author, Dan Sinker, who was a journalist,
539.742	who was completely anonymous this whole time,
542.077	I think Dan -- it made a lot of sense for him
545.775	to turn this into a book,
547.359	because it was a narrative format in the end,
550.732	and I think that turning it into a book
553.293	is representative of this idea that he had created something new
556.991	that needed to be translated into previous formats.
560.617	One of my favorite examples
562.71	of something that's happening on Twitter right now,
564.706	actually, is the very absurdist Crimer Show.
569.482	Crimer Show tells the story
571.914	of a supercriminal and a hapless detective
574.655	that face off in this exceptionally strange lingo,
578.34	with all of the tropes of a television show.
580.762	Crimer Show's creator has said that
582.299	it is a parody of a popular type of show in the U.K.,
587.291	but, man, is it weird.
590.149	And there are all these times where Crimer,
592.12	the supercriminal, does all of these TV things.
594.549	He's always taking off his sunglasses
596.801	or turning to the camera,
599.769	but these things just happen in text.
602.209	I think borrowing all of these tropes from television
605.043	and additionally presenting each Crimer Show
608.795	"as an episode, spelled E-P-P-A-S-O-D, ""eppasod,"""
614.028	presenting them as episodes
616.077	really, it creates something new.
619.107	"There is a new ""eppasod"" of Crimer Show"
622.696	on Twitter pretty much every day,
624.82	and they're archived that way.
626.432	And I think this is an interesting experiment in format.
629.213	Something totally new has been created here
631.497	out of parodying something on television.
635.033	I think in nonfiction real-time storytelling,
637.873	there are a lot of really excellent examples as well.
640.64	RealTimeWWII is an account
642.589	that documents what was happening on this day 60 years ago
646.652	in exceptional detail, as if
649.021	you were reading the news reports from that day.
651.75	And the author Teju Cole has done
653.505	a lot of experimentation with putting a literary twist
656.916	on events of the news.
658.544	In this particular case, he's talking about drone strikes.
662.987	I think that in both of these examples,
665.587	you're beginning to see ways in which
667.228	people are telling stories with nonfiction content
670.052	that can be built into new types
672.961	of fictional storytelling.
675.522	So with real-time storytelling,
678.084	blurring the lines between fact and fiction,
680.613	the real world and the digital world,
682.69	flexible identity, anonymity,
686.472	these are all tools that we have accessible to us,
689.993	and I think that they're just the building blocks.
691.885	They are the bits that we use
694.523	to create the structures, the frames,
697.16	that then become our settlements on this
700.258	wide open frontier for creative experimentation.
703.018	Thank you.
704.469	(Applause)
