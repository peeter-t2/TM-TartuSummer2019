12.543	On March 10, 2011,
15.286	I was in Cambridge at the MIT Media Lab
18.293	meeting with faculty, students and staff,
21.522	and we were trying to figure out whether
23.311	I should be the next director.
25.671	That night, at midnight,
28.04	a magnitude 9 earthquake
29.81	hit off of the Pacific coast of Japan.
32.676	My wife and family were in Japan,
34.961	and as the news started to come in,
38.271	I was panicking.
39.97	I was looking at the news streams
41.232	and listening to the press conferences
44.06	of the government officials
46.27	and the Tokyo Power Company,
47.86	and hearing about this explosion
50.411	at the nuclear reactors
51.61	and this cloud of fallout
53.291	that was headed towards our house
55.19	which was only about 200 kilometers away.
58.089	And the people on TV weren't telling us
60.92	anything that we wanted to hear.
62.86	I wanted to know what was going on with the reactor,
64.82	what was going on with the radiation,
66.242	whether my family was in danger.
68.57	So I did what instinctively felt like the right thing,
71.759	which was to go onto the Internet
73.43	and try to figure out
74.772	if I could take matters into my own hands.
77.183	On the Net, I found there were a lot of other people
79.024	like me trying to figure out what was going on,
81.09	and together we sort of loosely formed a group
83.306	and we called it Safecast,
85.777	and we decided we were going to try
86.949	to measure the radiation
88.695	and get the data out to everybody else,
90.469	because it was clear that the government
92.141	wasn't going to be doing this for us.
95.043	Three years later,
96.46	we have 16 million data points,
99.554	we have designed our own Geiger counters
102.299	that you can download the designs
103.952	and plug it into the network.
104.826	We have an app that shows you
106.73	most of the radiation in Japan
106.73	and other parts of the world.
109.757	We are arguably one of the most successful
111.962	citizen science projects in the world,
113.817	and we have created
116.169	the largest open dataset of radiation measurements.
119.67	And the interesting thing here
122.412	is how did — (Applause) — Thank you.
127.06	How did a bunch of amateurs
129.151	who really didn't know what we were doing
131.32	somehow come together
133.009	and do what NGOs and the government
136.193	were completely incapable of doing?
138.611	And I would suggest that this has something to do
141.369	with the Internet. It's not a fluke.
143.129	It wasn't luck, and it wasn't because it was us.
145.98	It helped that it was an event
147.398	that pulled everybody together,
149.033	but it was a new way of doing things
150.791	that was enabled by the Internet
152.87	and a lot of the other things that were going on,
154.462	and I want to talk a little bit about
156.475	what those new principles are.
159.144	So remember before the Internet? (Laughter)
163.952	I call this B.I. Okay?
165.74	So, in B.I., life was simple.
169.351	Things were Euclidian, Newtonian,
172.097	somewhat predictable.
173.556	People actually tried to predict the future,
175.966	even the economists.
177.68	And then the Internet happened,
180.894	and the world became extremely complex,
182.965	extremely low-cost, extremely fast,
185.602	and those Newtonian laws
187.72	that we so dearly cherished
189.519	turned out to be just local ordinances,
191.716	and what we found was that in this
193.467	completely unpredictable world
196.08	that most of the people who were surviving
198.112	were working with sort of a different set of principles,
201.445	and I want to talk a little bit about that.
204.076	Before the Internet, if you remember,
205.44	when we tried to create services,
207.345	what you would do is you'd create
208.371	the hardware layer and the
208.371	network layer and the software
210.683	and it would cost millions of dollars
212.711	to do anything that was substantial.
215.018	So when it costs millions of dollars
215.018	to do something substantial,
217.457	what you would do is you'd get an MBA
219.529	who would write a plan
220.987	and get the money
221.93	from V.C.s or big companies,
223.674	and then you'd hire the designers and the engineers,
225.787	and they'd build the thing.
226.81	This is the Before Internet, B.I., innovation model.
231.429	What happened after the Internet was
233.736	the cost of innovation went down so much
235.492	because the cost of collaboration,
235.492	the cost of distribution,
237.979	the cost of communication, and Moore's Law
240.622	made it so that the cost of trying a new thing
243.298	became nearly zero,
244.692	and so you would have Google, Facebook, Yahoo,
246.961	students that didn't have permission —
248.732	permissionless innovation —
250.105	didn't have permission, didn't have PowerPoints,
251.725	they just built the thing,
253.828	then they raised the money,
255.272	and then they sort of figured out a business plan
257.473	and maybe later on they hired some MBAs.
259.83	So the Internet caused innovation,
262.141	at least in software and services,
263.265	to go from an MBA-driven innovation model
266.124	to a designer-engineer-driven innovation model,
270.027	and it pushed innovation to the edges,
272.125	to the dorm rooms, to the startups,
273.671	away from the large institutions,
275.357	the stodgy old institutions that had the power
277.712	and the money and the authority.
279.399	And we all know this. We all know
279.399	this happened on the Internet.
282.008	It turns out it's happening in other things, too.
284.773	Let me give you some examples.
288.015	So at the Media Lab, we don't just do hardware.
290.8	We do all kinds of things.
291.842	We do biology, we do hardware,
293.727	and Nicholas Negroponte
293.727	"famously said, ""Demo or die,"""
297.348	"as opposed to ""Publish or perish,"""
299.07	which was the traditional academic way of thinking.
301.313	And he often said, the demo only has to work once,
304.875	because the primary mode of us impacting the world
307.691	was through large companies
309.469	being inspired by us
310.732	and creating products like
310.732	the Kindle or Lego Mindstorms.
314.248	But today, with the ability
316.19	to deploy things into the real world at such low cost,
318.499	I'm changing the motto now,
320.649	and this is the official public statement.
322.462	"I'm officially saying, ""Deploy or die."""
324.959	You have to get the stuff into the real world
327.18	for it to really count,
328.536	and sometimes it will be large companies,
330.415	and Nicholas can talk about satellites.
332.372	(Applause)
333.658	Thank you.
334.74	But we should be getting out there ourselves
336.514	and not depending on large
336.514	institutions to do it for us.
340.098	So last year, we sent a bunch
340.098	of students to Shenzhen,
342.8	and they sat on the factory floors
344.38	with the innovators in Shenzhen, and it was amazing.
346.685	What was happening there
348.162	was you would have these manufacturing devices,
350.346	and they weren't making prototypes or PowerPoints.
352.539	They were fiddling with the manufacturing equipment
355.004	and innovating right on the
355.004	manufacturing equipment.
358.214	The factory was in the designer,
360.1	and the designer was literally in the factory.
362.374	And so what you would do is,
364	you'd go down to the stalls
365.241	and you would see these cell phones.
367.797	So instead of starting little websites
370.322	like the kids in Palo Alto do,
371.87	the kids in Shenzhen make new cell phones.
374.41	They make new cell phones like kids in Palo Alto
377.107	make websites,
378.365	and so there's a rainforest
380.478	of innovation going on in the cell phone.
382.034	What they do is, they make a cell phone,
383.634	go down to the stall, they sell some,
385.858	they look at the other kids' stuff, go up,
388.183	make a couple thousand more, go down.
390.774	Doesn't this sound like a software thing?
392.765	It sounds like agile software development,
394.412	A/B testing and iteration,
397.34	and what we thought you could only do with software
399.423	kids in Shenzhen are doing this in hardware.
401.693	My next fellow, I hope, is going to be
403.16	one of these innovators from Shenzhen.
404.645	And so what you see is
406.31	that is pushing innovation to the edges.
408.279	We talk about 3D printers and stuff like that,
410.384	and that's great, but this is Limor.
412.375	She is one of our favorite graduates,
414.634	and she is standing in front of a Samsung
416.71	Techwin Pick and Place Machine.
418.543	This thing can put 23,000 components per hour
422.467	onto an electronics board.
424.46	This is a factory in a box.
426.283	So what used to take a factory full of workers
428.781	working by hand
429.8	in this little box in New York,
431.509	she's able to have effectively —
432.559	She doesn't actually have to go to Shenzhen
434.192	to do this manufacturing.
435.436	She can buy this box and she can manufacture it.
437.697	So manufacturing, the cost of innovation,
439.94	the cost of prototyping, distribution,
439.94	manufacturing, hardware,
442.63	is getting so low
444.093	that innovation is being pushed to the edges
446.41	and students and startups are being able to build it.
448.838	This is a recent thing, but this will happen
450.716	and this will change
452.199	just like it did with software.
454.624	Sorona is a DuPont process
457.87	that uses a genetically engineered microbe
460.89	to turn corn sugar into polyester.
464.84	It's 30 percent more efficient
464.84	than the fossil fuel method,
467.318	and it's much better for the environment.
470.977	Genetic engineering and bioengineering
472.382	are creating a whole bunch
473.913	of great new opportunities
475.671	for chemistry, for computation, for memory.
478.5	We will probably be doing a lot,
478.5	obviously doing health things,
480.55	but we will probably be growing chairs
482.754	and buildings soon.
483.794	The problem is, Sorona costs
483.794	about 400 million dollars
487.704	and took seven years to build.
489.085	It kind of reminds you of the old mainframe days.
492.164	The thing is, the cost of innovation
494.656	in bioengineering is also going down.
496.242	This is desktop gene sequencer.
498.211	It used to cost millions and millions
498.211	of dollars to sequence genes.
501.765	Now you can do it on a desktop like this,
503.509	and kids can do this in dorm rooms.
505.602	This is Gen9 gene assembler,
508.29	and so right now when you try to print a gene,
510.369	what you do is somebody in a factory
511.637	with pipettes puts the thing together by hand,
513.577	you have one error per 100 base pairs,
515.928	and it takes a long time and costs a lot of money.
518.504	This new device
519.89	assembles genes on a chip,
521.564	and instead of one error per 100 base pairs,
523.713	it's one error per 10,000 base pairs.
525.839	In this lab, we will have the world's capacity
528.584	of gene printing within a year,
533.299	This is kind of like when we went
535.862	from transistor radios wrapped by hand
538.123	to the Pentium.
539.394	This is going to become the
539.394	Pentium of bioengineering,
541.79	pushing bioengineering into the hands
543.826	of dorm rooms and startup companies.
546.427	So it's happening in software and in hardware
549.2	and bioengineering,
550.163	and so this is a fundamental new
550.163	way of thinking about innovation.
553.444	It's a bottom-up innovation, it's democratic,
556.121	it's chaotic, it's hard to control.
558.325	It's not bad, but it's very different,
560.632	and I think that the traditional rules that we have
562.599	for institutions don't work anymore,
564.671	and most of us here
566.35	operate with a different set of principles.
569.433	One of my favorite principles is the power of pull,
572.269	which is the idea of pulling resources
574.56	from the network as you need them
576.326	rather than stocking them in the center
578.171	and controlling everything.
579.756	So in the case of the Safecast story,
582.52	I didn't know anything when
582.52	the earthquake happened,
584.362	but I was able to find Sean
585.99	who was the hackerspace community organizer,
588.186	and Peter, the analog hardware hacker
589.972	who made our first Geiger counter,
591.688	and Dan, who built the Three Mile Island
593.686	monitoring system after the
593.686	Three Mile Island meltdown.
597.02	And these people I wouldn't have been able to find
599.406	beforehand and probably were better
601.84	that I found them just in time from the network.
604.967	I'm a three-time college dropout,
606.834	so learning over education
608.507	is very near and dear to my heart,
609.932	but to me, education is what people do to you
612.456	and learning is what you do to yourself.
615.455	(Applause)
619.231	And it feels like, and I'm biased,
620.99	it feels like they're trying to make you memorize
623.787	the whole encyclopedia before
623.787	they let you go out and play,
626.901	and to me, I've got Wikipedia on my cell phone,
630.998	and it feels like they assume
632.701	you're going to be on top of some mountain
634.488	all by yourself with a number 2 pencil
636.949	trying to figure out what to do
638.332	when in fact you're always going to be connected,
640.448	you're always going to have friends,
642.093	and you can pull Wikipedia
642.093	up whenever you need it,
644.052	and what you need to learn is how to learn.
647.5	In the case of Safecast, a bunch of amateurs
650.144	when we started three years ago,
651.742	I would argue that we probably as a group
654.25	know more than any other organization
656.666	about how to collect data and publish data
659.875	and do citizen science.
662.647	Compass over maps.
663.767	So this one, the idea is that the cost of writing a plan
667.492	or mapping something is getting so expensive
670.595	and it's not very accurate or useful.
673.768	So in the Safecast story, we
673.768	knew we needed to collect data,
676.88	we knew we wanted to publish the data,
679.303	and instead of trying to come up with the exact plan,
682.192	we first said, oh, let's get Geiger counters.
684.6	Oh, they've run out.
686.366	Let's build them. There aren't enough sensors.
688.369	Okay, then we can make a mobile Geiger counter.
690.596	We can drive around. We can get volunteers.
692.643	We don't have enough money. Let's Kickstarter it.
694.522	We could not have planned this whole thing,
696.513	but by having a very strong compass,
698.257	we eventually got to where we were going,
699.692	and to me it's very similar to
699.692	agile software development,
702.11	but this idea of compasses is very important.
705.468	So I think the good news is
707.409	that even though the world is extremely complex,
710.92	what you need to do is very simple.
713.302	I think it's about stopping this notion
716	that you need to plan everything,
717.572	you need to stock everything,
718.664	and you need to be so prepared,
720.134	and focus on being connected,
723.128	always learning,
724.979	fully aware,
726.84	and super present.
728.62	"So I don't like the word ""futurist."""
731.566	I think we should be now-ists,
737.181	like we are right now.
739.227	Thank you.
741.07	(Applause)
