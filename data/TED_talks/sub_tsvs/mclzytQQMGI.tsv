26.33	Chris Anderson: Thank you
26.33	so much, Prime Minister,
28.735	that was both fascinating
28.735	and quite inspiring.
30.95	So, you're calling for a global ethic.
34.33	Would you describe that
34.33	as global citizenship?
38.33	Is that an idea that you believe in,
38.33	and how would you define that?
41.545	Gordon Brown: It is
41.545	about global citizenship
43.695	and recognizing
43.695	our responsibilities to others.
45.916	There is so much to do
45.916	over the next few years
49.33	that is obvious to so many of us
52.33	to build a better world.
54.506	And there is so much shared sense
54.506	of what we need to do,
58.896	that it is vital
58.896	that we all come together.
60.926	But we don't necessarily have
60.926	the means to do so.
63.652	So there are challenges to be met.
65.89	I believe the concept
65.89	of global citizenship
68.33	will simply grow out of people talking
68.33	to each other across continents.
72.33	But of course the task
72.33	is to create the institutions
74.788	that make that global society work.
76.748	But I don't think we should underestimate
78.733	the extent to which
78.733	massive changes in technology
81.33	make possible the linking up
81.33	of people across the world.
84.539	CA: But people get excited
84.539	about this idea of global citizenship,
88.33	but then they get confused a bit again
90.33	when they start thinking about patriotism,
92.354	and how to combine these two.
94.092	I mean, you're elected as Prime Minister
96.33	with a brief to bat for Britain.
99.646	How do you reconcile the two things?
103.251	GB: Well, of course national identity
103.251	remains important.
106.252	But it's not at the expense of people
106.252	accepting their global responsibilities.
109.992	And I think one
109.992	of the problems of recession
113.07	is that people become more protectionist,
116.197	they look in on themselves,
118.006	they try to protect their own nation,
120.33	perhaps at the expense of other nations.
123.602	When you actually look
123.602	at the motor of the world economy,
126.33	it cannot move forward
128.091	unless there is trade
128.091	between the different countries.
131.01	And any nation that would become
131.01	protectionist over the next few years
134.549	would deprive itself of the chance
134.549	of getting the benefits
137.33	of growth in the world economy.
139.43	So, you've got to have
139.43	a healthy sense of patriotism;
142.692	that's absolutely important.
144.096	But you've got to realize
144.096	that this world has changed fundamentally,
147.406	and the problems we have cannot be solved
147.406	by one nation and one nation alone.
151.33	CA: Well, indeed.
152.491	But what do you do
152.491	when the two come into conflict
155.83	and you're forced to make a decision
157.855	that either is in Britain's interest,
157.855	or the interest of Britons,
162.33	or citizens elsewhere in the world?
164.713	GB: Well I think we can persuade people
166.74	that what is necessary
166.74	for Britain's long-term interests,
170.33	what is necessary
170.33	for America's long-term interests,
172.783	is proper engagement
172.783	with the rest of the world,
175.093	and taking the action that is necessary.
180.024	There is a great story, again,
180.024	told about Richard Nixon.
188.796	so it is just over 50 years ago.
191.203	Richard Nixon goes to represent
191.203	the United States government
195.218	at the celebrations
195.218	for independence in Ghana.
198.661	And it's one of his first outings
198.661	as Vice President to an African country.
203.33	He doesn't quite know what to do,
204.994	so he starts going around the crowd
206.767	and starts talking to people
208.33	and he says to people
208.33	in this rather unique way,
210.64	"""How does it feel to be free?"""
212.881	And he's going around,
212.881	"""How does it feel to be free?"""
215.627	"""How does it feel to be free?"""
217.238	And then someone says,
218.364	"""How should I know? I come from Alabama."""
220.535	(Laughter)
223.33	And that was the 1950s.
226.758	Now, what is remarkable
231.052	is that civil rights in America
231.052	were achieved in the 1960s.
235.33	But what is equally remarkable
237.33	is socioeconomic rights in Africa
237.33	have not moved forward very fast
242.33	even since the age of colonialism.
245.33	And yet, America and Africa
245.33	have got a common interest.
249.56	And we have got to realize
249.56	that if we don't link up
252.33	with those people who are sensible voices
252.33	and democratic voices in Africa,
256.33	to work together for common causes,
258.33	then the danger of Al Qaeda
258.33	and related groups
261.33	making progress in Africa is very big.
263.33	So, I would say that what seems sometimes
265.33	to be altruism, in relation to Africa,
265.33	or in relation to developing countries,
270.172	is more than that.
271.345	It is enlightened self-interest
271.345	for us to work with other countries.
274.663	And I would say that national interest
276.537	and, if you like,
276.537	what is the global interest
278.67	to tackle poverty and climate change
280.774	do, in the long run, come together.
283.33	And whatever the short-run price
283.33	for taking action on climate change
286.593	or on security, or taking action
286.593	to provide opportunities
289.3	for people for education,
290.589	these are prices that are worth paying
292.815	so that you build
292.815	a stronger global society
295.33	where people feel able to feel
295.33	comfortable with each other
298.739	and are able to communicate
298.739	with each other in such a way
301.445	that you can actually build stronger
301.445	links between different countries.
304.81	CA: I still just want to draw
304.81	out on this issue.
307.33	So, you're on vacation at a nice beach,
310.751	and word comes through
310.751	that there's been a massive earthquake
313.982	and that there is a tsunami
313.982	advancing on the beach.
316.426	One end of the beach, there is a house
316.426	containing a family of five Nigerians.
321.207	And at the other end of the beach
321.207	there is a single Brit.
324.487	You have time to --
325.892	(Laughter)
327.837	you have time to alert one house.
330.195	What do you do?
331.22	(Laughter)
333.33	GB: Modern communications.
335.33	(Applause)
338.33	Alert both.
340.33	(Applause)
343.79	I do agree that my responsibility
347.259	is first of all to make sure
347.259	that people in our country are safe.
350.45	And I wouldn't like anything
350.45	that is said today to suggest
353.784	that I am diminishing the importance
353.784	of the responsibility
356.537	that each leader
356.537	has for their own country.
358.957	But I'm trying to suggest
358.957	that there is a huge opportunity
362.133	open to us that was never
362.133	open to us before.
364.45	But the power to communicate
364.45	across borders
366.522	allows us to organize
366.522	the world in a different way.
370.282	And I think, look at the tsunami,
370.282	it's a classic example.
373.878	Where was the early warning systems?
376.33	Where was the world acting together
379.14	to deal with the problems
379.14	that they knew arose
381.399	from the potential for earthquakes,
383.856	as well as the potential
383.856	for climate change?
385.977	And when the world
385.977	starts to work together,
388.05	with better early-warning systems,
389.763	you can deal with some
389.763	of these problems in a better way.
392.469	I just think we're not seeing,
392.469	at the moment,
394.616	the huge opportunities open to us
394.616	by the ability of people to cooperate
398.57	in a world where either
398.57	there was isolationism before
401.571	or there was limited alliances
401.571	based on convenience
405.33	which never actually took you to deal
405.33	with some of the central problems.
408.82	CA: But I think this is the frustration
410.822	that perhaps a lot of people have,
410.822	like people in the audience here,
414.066	where we love the kind of language
414.066	that you're talking about.
416.979	It is inspiring.
418.012	A lot of us believe
418.012	that that has to be the world's future.
421.33	And yet, when the situation changes,
424.33	you suddenly hear
424.33	politicians talking as if,
427.136	you know, for example,
427.136	the life of one American soldier
430.33	is worth countless numbers
430.33	of Iraqi civilians.
433.01	When the pedal hits the metal,
436.589	the idealism can get moved away.
439.956	I'm just wondering whether
439.956	you can see that changing over time,
445.45	whether you see in Britain
447.33	that there are changing attitudes,
449.014	and that people are actually
449.014	more supportive
451.167	of the kind of global ethic
451.167	that you talk about.
454.761	GB: I think every religion, every faith,
457.634	and I'm not just talking here
457.634	to people of faith or religion --
460.763	it has this global ethic
460.763	at the center of its credo.
464.78	And whether it's Jewish
464.78	or whether it's Muslim
468.137	or whether it's Hindu,
468.137	or whether it's Sikh,
470.994	the same global ethic is at the heart
470.994	of each of these religions.
476.013	So, I think you're dealing with something
478.33	that people instinctively
478.33	see as part of their moral sense.
483.145	So you're building on something
483.145	that is not pure self-interest.
486.931	You're building
486.931	on people's ideas and values --
490.932	that perhaps they're candles
490.932	that burn very dimly on certain occasions.
497.06	But it is a set of values that cannot,
497.06	in my view, be extinguished.
501.232	Then the question is,
502.811	how do you make that change happen?
505.493	How do you persuade people
505.493	that it is in their interest
509.405	to build strong --
511.168	After the Second World War,
512.696	we built institutions, the United Nations,
515.697	the IMF, the World Bank,
517.084	the World Trade Organization,
517.084	the Marshall Plan.
519.942	There was a period in which people
519.942	talked about an act of creation,
523.999	because these institutions were so new.
526	But they are now out of date.
526	They don't deal with the problems.
529.135	You can't deal
529.135	with the environmental problem
531.294	through existing institutions.
532.793	You can't deal with the security problem
532.793	in the way that you need to.
536.33	You can't deal with the economic
536.33	and financial problem.
538.926	So we have got to rebuild
538.926	our global institutions,
541.33	build them in a way that is suitable
541.33	to the challenges of this time.
544.573	And I believe that if you look
544.573	at the biggest challenge we face,
547.665	it is to persuade people
547.665	to have the confidence
550.331	that we can build a truly global society
552.836	with the institutions
552.836	that are founded on these rules.
555.94	So, I come back to my initial point.
558.281	Sometimes you think things are impossible.
560.306	Nobody would have said 50 years ago
562.283	that apartheid would have gone in 1990,
564.33	or that the Berlin wall would have fallen
564.33	at the turn of the '80s and '90s,
568.753	or that polio could be eradicated,
570.551	or perhaps 60 years ago,
572.016	nobody would have said
572.016	a man could gone to the Moon.
574.508	All these things have happened.
576.33	By tackling the impossible,
576.33	you make the impossible possible.
579.746	CA: And we have had a speaker
579.746	who said that very thing,
583.33	and swallowed a sword right
583.33	after that, which was quite dramatic.
586.773	(Laughter)
587.93	GB: Followed my sword and swallow.
590.33	CA: But, surely a true global ethic
590.33	is for someone to say,
595.33	"""I believe that the life"
595.33	of every human on the planet
598.016	is worth the same, equal consideration,
601.017	"regardless of nationality and religion."""
604.33	And you have politicians who have --
607.331	you're elected.
608.408	In a way, you can't say that.
609.847	Even if, as a human being,
609.847	you believe that,
611.957	you can't say that.
613.35	You're elected for Britain's interests.
615.726	GB: We have a responsibility to protect.
618.33	I mean look, 1918,
618.33	the Treaty of Versailles,
621.63	and all the treaties before that,
623.466	the Treaty of Westphalia
623.466	and everything else,
625.617	were about protecting
625.617	the sovereign right of countries
628.261	to do what they want.
629.604	Since then, the world has moved forward,
631.88	partly as a result of what happened
631.88	with the Holocaust,
634.881	and people's concern
634.881	about the rights of individuals
637.752	within territories
637.752	where they need protection,
641.33	partly because of what we saw in Rwanda,
644.155	partly because of what we saw in Bosnia.
646.156	The idea of the responsibility to protect
648.33	all individuals who are in situations
648.33	where they are at humanitarian risk
652.33	is now being established as a principle
652.33	which governs the world.
655.402	So, while I can't automatically say
659.045	that Britain will rush to the aid
659.045	of any citizen of any country, in danger,
665.33	I can say that Britain is in a position
668.33	where we're working with other countries
670.33	so that this idea
670.33	that you have a responsibility
672.64	to protect people who are victims
672.64	of either genocide or humanitarian attack,
677.942	is something that is accepted
677.942	by the whole world.
680.291	Now, in the end, that can only be achieved
682.316	if your international institutions
682.316	work well enough to be able to do so.
685.918	And that comes back to what the future
685.918	role of the United Nations,
689.086	and what it can do, actually is.
691.33	But, the responsibility to protect
691.33	is a new idea that is, in a sense,
695.33	taken over from the idea
695.33	of self-determination
697.986	as the principle governing
697.986	the international community.
700.757	CA: Can you picture, in our lifetimes,
703.33	a politician ever going out on a platform
706.774	of the kind of full-form global ethic,
706.774	global citizenship?
711.948	"And basically saying, ""I believe"
711.948	that all people across the planet
716.64	have equal consideration,
718.115	and if in power we will act in that way.
721.021	And we believe that the people
721.021	of this country
723.322	are also now global citizens
723.322	"and will support that ethic."""
726.323	GB: Is that not what we're doing
726.323	in the debate about climate change?
730.232	We're saying that you cannot solve
733.002	the problem of climate change
733.002	in one country;
735.33	you've got to involve all countries.
737.177	You're saying that you must, and you have
737.177	a duty to help those countries
741.772	that cannot afford to deal with
741.772	the problems of climate change themselves.
745.468	You're saying you want a deal
747.429	with all the different
747.429	countries of the world
749.564	where we're all bound together
751.2	to cutting carbon emissions in a way
751.2	that is to the benefit of the whole world.
755.33	We've never had this before
755.33	because Kyoto didn't work.
759.33	If you could get a deal at Copenhagen,
759.33	where people agreed,
763.215	A, that there was a long-term target
763.215	for carbon emission cuts,
766.45	B, that there was short-range
766.45	targets that had to be met
769.33	so this wasn't just abstract;
771.141	it was people actually
771.141	making decisions now
773.402	that would make a difference now,
775.19	and if you could then find
775.19	a financing mechanism
777.593	that meant that the poorest countries
777.593	that had been hurt
780.33	by our inability to deal
780.33	with climate change
782.45	over many, many years and decades
784.33	are given special help
786.236	so that they can move
786.236	to energy-efficient technologies,
789.33	and they are in a position financially
792.148	to be able to afford
792.148	the long-term investment
794.497	that is associated
794.497	with cutting carbon emissions,
796.934	then you are treating the world equally,
800.573	by giving consideration
800.573	to every part of the planet
804.049	and the needs they have.
805.7	It doesn't mean that everybody
805.7	does exactly the same thing,
808.661	because we've actually got
808.661	to do more financially
810.993	to help the poorest countries,
812.461	but it does mean
812.461	there is equal consideration
815.228	for the needs of citizens
815.228	in a single planet.
818.711	CA: Yes.
819.75	And then of course the theory
819.75	is still that those talks get rent apart
823.239	by different countries fighting
823.239	over their own individual interests.
826.497	GB: Yes, but I think
826.497	Europe has got a position,
829.206	which is 27 countries have
829.206	already come together.
832.335	I mean, the great difficulty in Europe
834.33	is if you're at a meeting
834.33	and 27 people speak,
836.563	it takes a very, very long time.
838.33	But we did get an agreement
838.33	on climate change.
842.151	America has made
842.151	its first disposition on this
845.33	with the bill that President Obama
845.33	should be congratulated
849.172	for getting through Congress.
850.704	Japan has made an announcement.
852.909	China and India have signed up
852.909	to the scientific evidence.
856.33	And now we've got to move them to accept
859.198	a long-term target,
859.198	and then short-term targets.
861.87	But more progress has been made,
861.87	I think, in the last few weeks
864.953	than had been made for some years.
866.677	And I do believe
866.677	that there is a strong possibility
869.981	that if we work together, we can get
869.981	that agreement to Copenhagen.
873.497	I certainly have been
873.497	putting forward proposals
875.76	that would have allowed
875.76	the poorest parts of the world
878.593	to feel that we have taken into account
878.593	their specific needs.
882.66	And we would help them adapt.
884.661	And we would help them make
884.661	the transition to a low-carbon economy.
888.402	I do think a reform of the international
888.402	institutions is vital to this.
892.188	When the IMF was created in the 1940s,
894.513	it was created with resources that were
894.513	five percent or so of the world's GDP.
898.205	The IMF now has limited
898.205	resources, one percent.
900.539	It can't really make the difference
902.262	that ought to be made
902.262	in a period of crisis.
904.435	So, we've got to rebuild
904.435	the world institutions.
907.33	And that's a big task:
908.922	persuading all the different countries
910.776	with the different voting shares
910.776	in these institutions to do so.
913.845	There is a story told
913.845	about the three world leaders
917.053	of the day getting a chance
917.053	to get some advice from God.
921.711	And the story is told
921.711	that Bill Clinton went to God
925.734	and he asked when there will be
925.734	successful climate change
930.924	and a low-carbon economy.
932.497	And God shook his head and said,
934.108	"""Not this year, not this decade,"
934.108	"perhaps not even in [your] lifetime."""
938.251	And Bill Clinton walked away in tears
941.33	because he had failed
941.33	to get what he wanted.
943.45	And then the story is that Barroso,
943.45	the president of the European Commission,
947.099	went to God and he asked,
948.58	"""When will we get"
948.58	"a recovery of global growth?"""
952.949	"And God said, ""Not this year,"
952.949	not in this decade,
955.308	"perhaps not in your lifetime."""
956.951	So Barroso walked away
956.951	crying and in tears.
960.707	And then the Secretary-General
960.707	of the United Nations
965.33	came up to speak to God and said,
967.818	"""When will our international"
967.818	"institutions work?"""
971.06	And God cried.
972.277	(Laughter)
976.059	It is very important to recognize
976.059	that this reform of institutions
982.729	is the next stage after
982.729	agreeing upon ourselves
986.753	that there is a clear ethic
986.753	upon which we can build.
989.964	CA: Prime Minister, I think
989.964	there are many in the audience
992.719	who are truly appreciative
992.719	of the efforts you made
995.105	in terms of the financial mess
995.105	we got ourselves into.
997.63	And there are certainly
997.63	many people in the audience
1000.283	who will be cheering you on as you seek
1000.283	to advance this global ethic.
1003.591	Thank you so much for coming to TED.
1005.546	GB: Well, thank you.
1006.879	(Applause)
