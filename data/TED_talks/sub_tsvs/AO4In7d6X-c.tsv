19.085	(Laughter)
24.323	(Laughter)
36.71	That's SpotMini.
37.884	He'll be back in a little while.
39.526	I --
40.714	(Applause)
45.472	I love building robots.
48.419	And my long-term goal is to build robots
50.895	that can do what people and animals do.
53.964	And there's three things in particular
57.541	that we're interested in.
60.008	One is balance and dynamic mobility,
63.334	the second one is mobile manipulation,
65.988	and the third one is mobile perception.
68.944	So, dynamic mobility and balance --
71.879	I'm going to do a demo for you.
75.099	I'm standing here, balancing.
78.121	I can see you're not very impressed.
78.121	OK, how about now?
80.859	(Laughter)
82.043	How about now?
83.26	(Applause)
86.049	Those simple capabilities mean that people
86.049	can go almost anywhere on earth,
90.446	on any kind of terrain.
92.122	We want to capture that for robots.
95.772	What about manipulation?
97.614	I'm holding this clicker in my hand;
99.354	I'm not even looking at it,
100.67	and I can manipulate it
100.67	without any problem.
103.424	But even more important,
106.088	I can move my body while I hold
106.088	the manipulator, the clicker,
112.115	and stabilize and coordinate my body,
114.313	and I can even walk around.
116.367	And that means
116.367	I can move around in the world
119.289	and expand the range
119.289	of my arms and my hands
122.615	and really be able to handle
122.615	almost anything.
124.808	So that's mobile manipulation.
127.454	And all of you can do this.
129.253	Third is perception.
131.194	I'm looking at a room
131.194	with over 1,000 people in it,
134.483	and my amazing visual system
134.483	can see every one of you --
139.282	you're all stable in space,
141.267	even when I move my head,
142.61	even when I move around.
144.18	That kind of mobile perception
144.18	is really important for robots
147.983	that are going to move and act
149.651	out in the world.
151.865	I'm going to give you
151.865	a little status report
154.167	on where we are in developing robots
154.167	toward these ends.
160.338	The first three robots are all
160.338	dynamically stabilized robots.
164.902	This one goes back
164.902	a little over 10 years ago --
167.574	"""BigDog."""
168.766	It's got a gyroscope
168.766	that helps stabilize it.
172.1	It's got sensors and a control computer.
175.46	Here's a Cheetah robot
175.46	that's running with a galloping gait,
178.651	where it recycles its energy,
180.371	it bounces on the ground,
181.962	and it's computing all the time
183.54	in order to keep itself
183.54	stabilized and propelled.
187.934	And here's a bigger robot
189.786	that's got such good
189.786	locomotion using its legs,
192.515	that it can go in deep snow.
193.943	This is about 10 inches deep,
196.378	and it doesn't really have any trouble.
200.166	This is Spot, a new generation of robot --
202.819	just slightly older than the one
202.819	that came out onstage.
206.258	And we've been asking the question --
208.114	you've all heard about drone delivery:
210.112	Can we deliver packages
210.112	to your houses with drones?
212.759	Well, what about plain old
212.759	legged-robot delivery?
215.57	(Laughter)
216.726	So we've been taking our robot
216.726	to our employees' homes
220.147	to see whether we could get in --
221.754	(Laughter)
222.802	the various access ways.
224.054	And believe me, in the Boston area,
225.962	there's every manner
225.962	of stairway twists and turns.
229.16	So it's a real challenge.
230.421	But we're doing very well,
230.421	about 70 percent of the way.
234.479	And here's mobile manipulation,
236.068	where we've put an arm on the robot,
238.683	and it's finding its way through the door.
241.742	Now, one of the important things
241.742	about making autonomous robots
244.925	is to make them not do
244.925	just exactly what you say,
248.169	but make them deal with the uncertainty
248.169	of what happens in the real world.
254.054	So we have Steve there,
254.054	one of the engineers,
257.089	giving the robot a hard time.
258.721	(Laughter)
259.777	And the fact that the programming
259.777	still tolerates all that disturbance --
263.991	it does what it's supposed to.
265.512	Here's another example,
265.512	where Eric is tugging on the robot
268.327	as it goes up the stairs.
269.649	And believe me,
270.825	getting it to do what it's supposed to do
270.825	in those circumstances
274.121	is a real challenge,
275.486	but the result is something
275.486	that's going to generalize
278.25	and make robots much more autonomous
278.25	than they would be otherwise.
283.317	This is Atlas, a humanoid robot.
286.427	It's a third-generation humanoid
286.427	that we've been building.
290.671	I'll tell you a little bit
290.671	about the hardware design later.
293.513	And we've been saying:
294.713	How close to human levels
294.713	of performance and speed could we get
299.16	in an ordinary task,
300.759	like moving boxes around on a conveyor?
303.931	We're getting up to about two-thirds
303.931	of the speed that a human operates
309.261	on average.
310.758	And this robot is using both hands,
310.758	it's using its body,
313.711	it's stepping,
314.904	so it's really an example
314.904	of dynamic stability,
317.655	mobile manipulation
319.058	and mobile perception.
322.192	Here --
323.905	(Laughter)
326.389	We actually have two Atlases.
328.483	(Laughter)
330.198	Now, everything doesn't go exactly
330.198	the way it's supposed to.
333.618	(Laughter)
338.318	(Laughter)
340.536	(Laughter)
345.292	And here's our latest robot,
345.292	"called ""Handle."""
348.457	Handle is interesting,
348.457	because it's sort of half like an animal,
352.599	and it's half something else
354.937	with these leg-like things and wheels.
358.141	It's got its arms on
358.141	in kind of a funny way,
361.191	but it really does some remarkable things.
363.311	It can carry 100 pounds.
366.666	It's probably going to lift
366.666	more than that,
368.749	but so far we've done 100.
370.551	It's got some pretty good
370.551	rough-terrain capability,
373.011	even though it has wheels.
377.881	And Handle loves to put on a show.
380.686	(Laughter)
384.644	(Applause)
390.74	I'm going to give you
390.74	a little bit of robot religion.
394.356	A lot of people think that a robot
394.356	is a machine where there's a computer
398.709	that's telling it what to do,
400.9	and the computer is listening
400.9	through its sensors.
404.349	But that's really only half of the story.
406.777	The real story is
406.777	that the computer is on one side,
409.91	making suggestions to the robot,
411.878	and on the other side
411.878	are the physics of the world.
414.778	And that physics involves gravity,
414.778	friction, bouncing into things.
420.238	In order to have a successful robot,
422.097	my religion is that you have to do
422.097	a holistic design,
426.712	where you're designing the software,
426.712	the hardware and the behavior
430.289	all at one time,
431.549	and all these parts really intermesh
431.549	and cooperate with each other.
435.275	And when you get the perfect design,
435.275	you get a real harmony
438.406	between all those parts
438.406	interacting with each other.
442.269	So it's half software and half hardware,
444.553	plus the behavior.
446.698	We've done some work lately
446.698	on the hardware, where we tried to go --
450.264	the picture on the left
450.264	is a conventional design,
452.765	where you have parts
452.765	that are all bolted together,
455.689	conductors, tubes, connectors.
458.453	And on the right
458.453	is a more integrated thing;
460.526	it's supposed to look like
460.526	an anatomy drawing.
463.33	Using the miracle of 3-D printing,
465.864	we're starting to build parts of robots
468.525	that look a lot more
468.525	like the anatomy of an animal.
471.446	So that's an upper-leg part
471.446	that has hydraulic pathways --
474.814	actuators, filters --
476.768	all embedded, all printed as one piece,
479.172	and the whole structure is developed
482.398	with a knowledge of what the loads
482.398	and behavior are going to be,
485.458	which is available from data
485.458	recorded from robots
488.385	and simulations and things like that.
490.218	So it's a data-driven hardware design.
493.547	And using processes like that,
495.297	not only the upper leg
495.297	but some other things,
497.565	we've gotten our robots to go from big,
497.565	behemoth, bulky, slow, bad robots --
502.729	that one on the right,
502.729	weighing almost 400 pounds --
506.372	down to the one in the middle
506.372	which was just in the video,
509.505	weighs about 190 pounds,
511.092	just a little bit more than me,
512.813	and we have a new one,
514.323	which is working but I'm not
514.323	going to show it to you yet,
517.089	on the left,
518.275	which weighs just 165 pounds,
519.943	with all the same
519.943	strength and capabilities.
522.233	So these things are really getting
522.233	better very quickly.
526.28	So it's time for Spot to come back out,
529.566	and we're going to demonstrate
529.566	a little bit of mobility,
533.338	dexterity and perception.
535.681	This is Seth Davis,
535.681	who's my robot wrangler today,
539.469	and he's giving Spot
539.469	some general direction
542.533	by steering it around,
544.383	but all the coordination
544.383	of the legs and the sensors
547.478	is done by the robot's computers on board.
550.543	The robot can walk
550.543	with a number of different gaits;
554.013	it's got a gyro,
556.196	or a solid-state gyro,
557.557	an IMU on board.
559.442	Obviously, it's got a battery,
559.442	and things like that.
563.352	One of the cool things
563.352	about a legged robot is,
565.882	it's omnidirectional.
567.355	In addition to going forward,
567.355	it can go sideways,
571.413	it can turn in place.
576.482	And this robot
576.482	is a little bit of a show-off.
579.675	It loves to use its dynamic gaits,
581.659	like running --
582.841	(Laughter)
583.909	And it's got one more.
587.104	(Laughter)
589.858	Now if it were really a show-off,
589.858	it would be hopping on one foot,
593.118	but, you know.
594.31	Now, Spot has a set of cameras
594.31	here, stereo cameras,
598.377	and we have a feed up in the center.
600.591	It's kind of dark out in the audience,
602.439	but it's going to use those cameras
602.439	in order to look at the terrain
605.683	right in front of it,
606.88	while it goes over
606.88	these obstacles back here.
609.665	For this demo, Seth is steering,
613.002	but the robot's doing
613.002	all its own terrain planning.
615.531	This is a terrain map,
617.057	where the data from the cameras
617.057	is being developed in real time,
622.251	showing the red spots,
622.251	which are where it doesn't want to step,
625.512	and the green spots are the good places.
627.527	And here it's treating
627.527	them like stepping-stones.
630	So it's trying to stay up on the blocks,
632.779	and it adjusts its stride,
634.076	and there's a ton of planning
635.561	that has to go into
635.561	an operation like that,
637.826	and it does all
637.826	that planning in real time,
640.112	where it adjusts the steps
640.112	a little bit longer
642.566	or a little bit shorter.
645.216	Now we're going to change it
645.216	into a different mode,
647.67	where it's just going to treat
647.67	the blocks like terrain
651.117	and decide whether to step up or down
654.86	as it goes.
657.085	So this is using dynamic balance
660.078	and mobile perception,
661.96	because it has to coordinate what it sees
661.96	along with how it's moving.
668.988	The other thing Spot has is a robot arm.
674.337	Some of you may see that
674.337	as a head and a neck,
676.851	but believe me, it's an arm.
678.46	Seth is driving it around.
680.249	He's actually driving the hand
680.249	and the body is following.
684.041	So the two are coordinated
684.041	in the way I was talking about before --
688.198	in the way people can do that.
690.086	In fact, one of the cool things
690.086	"Spot can do we call, ""chicken-head mode,"""
694.753	and it keeps its head
694.753	in one place in space,
697.961	and it moves its body all around.
700.553	There's a variation of this
700.553	"that's called ""twerking"" --"
703.179	(Laughter)
704.219	but we're not going to use that today.
706.066	(Laughter)
707.161	So, Spot: I'm feeling a little thirsty.
707.161	Could you get me a soda?
711.293	For this demo,
711.293	Seth is not doing any driving.
715.09	We have a LIDAR on the back of the robot,
717.227	and it's using these props
717.227	we've put on the stage
719.788	to localize itself.
721.205	It's gone over to that location.
723.51	Now it's using a camera that's in its hand
726.416	to find the cup,
728.853	picks it up --
730.132	and again, Seth's not driving.
733.372	We've planned out a path for it to go --
736.637	it looked like it was
736.637	going off the path --
738.768	and now Seth's going
738.768	to take over control again,
741.15	because I'm a little bit chicken
741.15	about having it do this by itself.
744.623	Thank you, Spot.
748.231	(Applause)
754.889	So, Spot:
756.503	How do you feel about having just finished
756.503	your TED performance?
761.014	(Laughter)
764.068	Me, too!
765.244	(Laughter)
766.3	Thank you all,
768.14	and thanks to the team at Boston Dynamics,
770.559	who did all the hard work behind this.
772.697	(Applause)
783.059	Helen Walters: Marc,
783.059	come back in the middle.
785.246	Thank you so much.
786.424	Come over here, I have questions.
788.543	So, you mentioned the UPS
788.543	and the package delivery.
791.982	What are the other applications
791.982	that you see for your robots?
795.943	Marc Raibert: You know,
795.943	I think that robots
797.994	that have the capabilities
797.994	I've been talking about
800.424	are going to be incredibly useful.
802.108	About a year ago, I went to Fukushima
804.629	to see what the situation was there,
806.684	and there's just a huge need
808.585	for machines that can go
808.585	into some of the dirty places
811.947	and help remediate that.
814.528	I think it won't be too long until
814.528	we have robots like this in our homes,
819.151	and one of the big needs
819.151	is to take care of the aging
824.496	and invalids.
825.886	I think that it won't be too long
825.886	till we're using robots
829.899	to help take care of our parents,
832.385	or probably more likely,
832.385	have our children help take care of us.
837.721	And there's a bunch of other things.
839.495	I think the sky's the limit.
840.885	Many of the ideas
840.885	we haven't thought of yet,
843.167	and people like you will help us
843.167	think of new applications.
846.786	HW: So what about the dark side?
848.397	What about the military?
850.254	Are they interested?
852.441	MR: Sure, the military has been
852.441	a big funder of robotics.
856.099	I don't think the military
856.099	is the dark side myself,
860.325	but I think, as with all
860.325	advanced technology,
864.22	it can be used for all kinds of things.
866.291	HW: Awesome. Thank you so much.
867.956	MR: OK, you're welcome.
869.385	Thank you.
870.561	(Applause)
