12.693	When you grow up in a developing country
12.693	like India, as I did,
17.754	you instantly learn to get more value
17.754	from limited resources
23.107	and find creative ways to reuse
23.107	what you already have.
28.127	Take Mansukh Prajapati,
28.127	a potter in India.
32.435	He has created a fridge
32.435	made entirely of clay
37.977	that consumes no electricity.
40.275	He can keep fruits and vegetables
40.275	fresh for many days.
44.13	That's a cool invention, literally.
48.68	In Africa, if you run out of
48.68	your cell phone battery, don't panic.
52.906	You will find some
52.906	resourceful entrepreneurs
55.92	who can recharge your 
55.92	cell phone using bicycles.
58.565	And since we are in South America,
60.698	let's go to Lima in Peru,
63.842	a region with high humidity
66.466	that receives only one inch
66.466	of rainfall each year.
71.23	An engineering college in Lima
71.23	designed a giant advertising billboard
78.124	that absorbs air humidity
78.124	and converts it into purified water,
84.787	generating over 90 liters
84.787	of water every day.
89.664	The Peruvians are amazing.
91.751	They can literally create
91.751	water out of thin air.
96.432	For the past seven years,
98.476	I have met and studied
98.476	hundreds of entrepreneurs
102.252	in India, China, Africa and South America,
102.252	and they keep amazing me.
108.84	Many of them did not go to school.
112.041	They don't invent stuff in big R&amp;D labs.
115.517	The street is the lab.
119.48	Why do they do that?
121.059	Because they don't have the kind
121.059	of basic resources we take for granted,
124.526	like capital and energy,
126.367	and basic services
126.367	like healthcare and education
129.315	are also scarce in those regions.
132.958	When external resources are scarce,
132.958	you have to go within yourself
138.945	to tap the most abundant
138.945	resource, human ingenuity,
142.905	and use that ingenuity to find clever ways
142.905	to solve problems with limited resources.
149.7	In India, we call it Jugaad.
153.986	Jugaad is a Hindi word
156.162	that means an improvised fix,
156.162	a clever solution born in adversity.
162.19	Jugaad solutions are not
162.19	sophisticated or perfect,
166.824	but they create more value at lower cost.
170.353	For me, the entrepreneurs
170.353	who will create Jugaad solutions
173.812	are like alchemists.
175.786	They can magically transform
175.786	adversity into opportunity,
179.849	and turn something of less value
179.849	into something of high value.
185.35	In other words, they mastered the art
185.35	of doing more with less,
192.318	which is the essence of frugal innovation.
197.287	Frugal innovation is the ability 
197.287	to create more economic and social value
202.917	using fewer resources.
206.277	Frugal innovation is not about making do;
206.277	it's about making things better.
213.238	Now I want to show you how,
213.238	across emerging markets,
218.21	entrepreneurs and companies are adopting 
218.21	frugal innovation on a larger scale
223.109	to cost-effectively deliver healthcare
223.109	and energy to billions of people
227.565	who may have little income
227.565	but very high aspirations.
232.96	Let's first go to China,
235.18	where the country's largest
235.18	I.T. service provider, Neusoft,
239.197	has developed a telemedicine solution
242.03	to help doctors in cities
242.03	remotely treat old and poor patients
246.722	in Chinese villages.
248.553	This solution is based on
248.553	simple-to-use medical devices
253.198	that less qualified health workers
253.198	like nurses can use in rural clinics.
258.355	China desperately needs
258.355	these frugal medical solutions
262.37	because by 2050 it will be home
262.37	to over half a billion senior citizens.
269.568	Now let's go to Kenya,
272.516	a country where half the population
272.516	uses M-Pesa, a mobile payment solution.
278.507	This is a great solution
278.507	for the African continent
281.247	because 80 percent of Africans
281.247	don't have a bank account,
285.332	but what is exciting is that M-Pesa
285.332	is now becoming the source
290.031	of other disruptive business models
290.031	in sectors like energy.
294.65	Take M-KOPA, the home solar solution
294.65	that comes literally in a box
300.468	that has a solar rooftop panel,
300.468	three LED lights,
305.463	a solar radio, and a cell phone charger.
308.687	The whole kit, though, costs 200 dollars,
308.687	which is too expensive for most Kenyans,
314.915	and this is where mobile telephony
314.915	can make the solution more affordable.
320.858	Today, you can buy this kit by making
320.858	an initial deposit of just 35 dollars,
327.011	and then pay off the rest by making
327.011	a daily micro-payment of 45 cents
332.398	using your mobile phone.
334.79	Once you've made 365 micro-payments,
334.79	the system is unlocked,
339.713	and you own the product and you start 
339.713	receiving clean, free electricity.
345.958	This is an amazing solution for Kenya,
348.28	where 70 percent of people
348.28	live off the grid.
352.94	This shows that with frugal innovation
356.128	what matters is that you take what is
356.128	most abundant, mobile connectivity,
361.12	to deal with what is scarce,
361.12	which is energy.
366.191	With frugal innovation,
366.191	the global South is actually catching up
370.761	and in some cases 
370.761	even leap-frogging the North.
374.288	Instead of building expensive hospitals,
374.288	China is using telemedicine
379.48	to cost-effectively treat
379.48	millions of patients,
383.109	and Africa, instead of building
383.109	banks and electricity grids,
387.799	is going straight to mobile payments
387.799	and distributed clean energy.
393.116	Frugal innovation is diametrically opposed
393.116	to the way we innovate in the North.
399.875	I live in Silicon Valley,
401.521	where we keep chasing
401.521	the next big technology thing.
404.934	Think of the iPhone 5, 6, then 7, 8.
409.578	Companies in the West spend
409.578	billions of dollars investing in R&amp;D,
413.967	and use tons of natural resources
413.967	to create ever more complex products,
418.431	to differentiate their brands
418.431	from competition,
421.767	and they charge customers
421.767	more money for new features.
425.854	So the conventional business model 
425.854	in the West is more for more.
433.225	But sadly, this more for more model
433.225	is running out of gas, for three reasons:
438.744	First, a big portion
438.744	of customers in the West
442.89	because of the diminishing
442.89	purchasing power,
445.872	can no longer afford
445.872	these expensive products.
448.702	Second, we are running out of
448.702	natural water and oil.
453.82	In California, where I live,
453.82	water scarcity is becoming a big problem.
457.721	And third, most importantly,
460.338	because of the growing income disparity
462.713	between the rich 
462.713	and the middle class in the West,
465.773	there is a big disconnect
465.773	between existing products and services
469.191	and basic needs of customers.
471.372	Do you know that today,
473.27	there are over 70 million Americans
473.27	today who are underbanked,
478.036	because existing banking services
481.358	are not designed to address
481.358	their basic needs.
485.616	The prolonged economic crisis
485.616	in the West is making people think
489.508	that they are about to lose
489.508	the high standard of living
492.782	and face deprivation.
495.638	I believe that the only way we can sustain
495.638	growth and prosperity in the West
500.096	is if we learn to do more with less.
503.597	The good news is,
503.597	that's starting to happen.
506.635	Several Western companies
506.635	are now adopting frugal innovation
510.15	to create affordable products
510.15	for Western consumers.
514.515	Let me give you two examples.
516.945	When I first saw this building,
518.718	I told myself it's some
518.718	kind of postmodern house.
521.875	Actually, it's a small manufacturing plant
521.875	set up by Grameen Danone,
527.123	a joint venture between 
527.123	Grameen Bank of Muhammad Yunus
530.579	and the food multinational Danone
532.515	to make high-quality yogurt in Bangladesh.
535.83	This factory is 10 percent the size
535.83	of existing Danone factories
539.774	and cost much less to build.
542.536	I guess you can call it a low-fat factory.
546.07	Now this factory, unlike Western factories
546.07	that are highly automated,
550.76	relies a lot on manual processes in order 
550.76	to generate jobs for local communities.
557.493	Danone was so inspired by this model
559.769	that combines economic efficiency
559.769	and social sustainability,
563.749	they are planning to roll it out
563.749	in other parts of the world as well.
568.121	Now, when you see this example,
570.123	"you might be thinking, ""Well,"
570.123	"frugal innovation is low tech."""
573.917	Actually, no.
575.56	Frugal innovation is also
575.56	about making high tech
578.782	more affordable and more
578.782	accessible to more people.
581.963	Let me give you an example.
583.787	In China, the R&amp;D engineers
583.787	of Siemens Healthcare
586.993	have designed a C.T. scanner
586.993	that is easy enough to be used
591.986	by less qualified health workers,
591.986	like nurses and technicians.
595.709	This device can scan
595.709	more patients on a daily basis,
599.517	and yet consumes less energy,
601.792	which is great for hospitals,
601.792	but it's also great for patients
605.713	because it reduces the cost
605.713	of treatment by 30 percent
610.406	and radiation dosage by up to 60 percent.
614.052	This solution was initially designed
614.052	for the Chinese market,
617.674	but now it's selling like hotcakes
617.674	in the U.S. and Europe,
621.691	where hospitals are pressured
621.691	to deliver quality care at lower cost.
628.122	But the frugal innovation revolution
630.584	in the West is actually led
630.584	by creative entrepreneurs
634.833	who are coming up with amazing solutions
636.992	to address basic needs
636.992	in the U.S. and Europe.
640.175	Let me quickly give you
640.175	three examples of startups
643.377	that personally inspire me.
645.049	The first one happens to be launched
645.049	by my neighbor in Silicon Valley.
648.657	It's called gThrive.
650.506	They make these wireless sensors
650.506	designed like plastic rulers
654.337	that farmers can stick
654.337	in different parts of the field
657.146	and start collecting detailed
657.146	information like soil conditions.
661.07	This dynamic data allows farmers
661.07	to optimize use of water energy
666.085	while improving quality
666.085	of the products and the yields,
670.335	which is a great solution for California,
670.335	which faces major water shortage.
674.964	It pays for itself within one year.
677.463	Second example is Be-Bound,
677.463	also in Silicon Valley,
681.108	that enables you
681.108	to connect to the Internet
683.732	even in no-bandwidth areas
683.732	where there's no wi-fi or 3G or 4G.
688.681	How do they do that?
690.164	They simply use SMS, a basic technology,
690.164	but that happens to be the most reliable
696.568	and most widely available
696.568	around the world.
698.97	Three billion people today with 
698.97	cell phones can't access the Internet.
702.28	This solution can connect them
702.28	to the Internet in a frugal way.
706.788	And in France, there is
706.788	a startup calle Compte Nickel,
713.174	It allows thousands of people
713.174	to walk into a Mom and Pop store
717.167	and in just five minutes activate
717.167	the service that gives them two products:
721.486	an international bank account number
721.486	and an international debit card.
725.716	They charge a flat annual 
725.716	maintenance fee of just 20 Euros.
730.256	That means you can do
730.256	all banking transactions --
732.558	send and receive money,
732.558	pay with your debit card --
734.953	all with no additional charge.
737.321	This is what I call low-cost banking
737.321	without the bank.
741.222	Amazingly, 75 percent
741.222	of the customers using this service
745.665	are the middle-class French
745.665	who can't afford high banking fees.
750.463	Now, I talked about frugal innovation,
750.463	initially pioneered in the South,
754.875	now being adopted in the North.
756.965	Ultimately, we would like to see
759.333	developed countries
759.333	and developing countries
761.678	come together and co-create
761.678	frugal solutions
764.743	that benefit the entire humanity.
767.135	The exciting news is
767.135	that's starting to happen.
769.923	Let's go to Nairobi to find that out.
772.547	Nairobi has horrendous traffic jams.
776.167	When I first saw them,
776.167	"I thought, ""Holy cow."""
779.082	Literally, because you have to dodge cows
779.082	as well when you drive in Nairobi.
784.258	To ease the situation,
786.186	the engineers at the IBM lab in Kenya
786.186	are piloting a solution called Megaffic,
792.707	which initially was designed
792.707	by the Japanese engineers.
797.25	Unlike in the West, Megaffic
797.25	doesn't rely on roadside sensors,
802.424	which are very expensive
802.424	to install in Nairobi.
804.702	Instead they process images, traffic data,
808.397	collected from a small number of
808.397	low-resolution webcams in Nairobi streets,
814.026	and then they use analytic software
814.026	to predict congestion points,
818.216	and they can SMS drivers
818.216	alternate routes to take.
822.117	Granted, Megaffic is not
822.117	as sexy as self-driving cars,
826.459	but it promises to take Nairobi drivers
826.459	from point A to point B
831.446	at least 20 percent faster.
834.696	And earlier this year, UCLA Health
834.696	launched its Global Lab for Innovation,
841.412	which seeks to identify frugal healthcare 
841.412	solutions anywhere in the world
846.087	that will be at least 20 percent cheaper
846.087	than existing solutions in the U.S.
851.474	and yet more effective.
853.584	It also tries to bring together
853.584	innovators from North and South
858.339	to cocreate affordable healthcare
858.339	solutions for all of humanity.
864.027	I gave tons of examples of frugal
864.027	innovators from around the world,
868.3	but the question is, how do you go about
868.3	adopting frugal innovation?
872.328	Well, I gleaned out three principles
872.328	from frugal innovators around the world
875.923	that I want to share with you
877.669	that you can apply
877.669	in your own organization
879.94	to do more with less.
882.649	The first principle is: Keep it simple.
886.829	Don't create solutions
886.829	to impress customers.
889.87	Make them easy enough to use
889.87	and widely accessible,
893.121	like the C.T. scanner we saw in China.
896.128	Second principle: 
896.128	Do not reinvent the wheel.
900.319	Try to leverage existing resources
900.319	and assets that are widely available,
904.405	like using mobile telephony
904.405	to offer clean energy
908.399	or Mom and Pop stores
908.399	to offer banking services.
912.091	Third principle is:
912.091	Think and act horizontally.
916.381	Companies tend to scale up vertically
919.567	by centralizing operations
919.567	in big factories and warehouses,
923.097	but if you want to be agile and deal
923.097	with immense customer diversity,
927.253	you need to scale out horizontally
927.253	using a distributed supply chain
932.052	with smaller manufacturing
932.052	and distribution units,
934.906	like Grameen Bank has shown.
939.164	The South pioneered frugal innovation
939.164	out of sheer necessity.
944.379	The North is now learning to do
944.379	more and better with less
948.684	as it faces resource constraints.
951.958	As an Indian-born French national
951.958	who lives in the United States,
957.321	my hope is that we transcend
957.321	this artificial North-South divide
963.702	so that we can harness
963.702	the collective ingenuity
966.043	of innovators from around the world
968.397	to cocreate frugal solutions
971.021	that will improve the quality of life
971.021	of everyone in the world,
975.479	while preserving our precious planet.
978.358	Thank you very much.
980.448	(Applause)
