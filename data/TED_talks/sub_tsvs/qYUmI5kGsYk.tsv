12.793	We humans are becoming an urban species,
18.36	so cities, they are our natural habitat.
22.16	That is where we live.
24.72	In 2014, over 54 percent
29	of the world population
30.64	was living in cities,
34.12	and I can bet you
36.28	that so many of these people have thought
38.96	of how they would do things differently,
41.56	like if I only had the tools
44.24	to change things in my city,
47.64	what would I do?
48.92	What would my dream city be like?
52.36	And these tools,
53.92	this is just what we gave them.
58.12	Two years ago, my team and I,
60.68	we released a game,
62.12	"""Cities: Skylines."""
63.84	It is a game about building cities.
67.68	So I have always been
67.68	interested in cities as systems.
71.36	It's something that I find
71.36	immensely interesting.
75.28	But what I didn't understand
77.44	was that I am not alone in this.
80.8	People love cities.
82.36	They are interested. They have ideas.
84.88	The game was an instant hit.
87.12	So far, over three and a half
87.12	million people have played it.
93.28	And it's not just about playing.
96.08	We also have really awesome
96.08	sharing systems.
100.84	So people play, they create cities
103.56	and then they are sharing these creations,
106.4	showing off what they have made.
109.4	And what I will show you
112.56	is some of these cities
114.8	created by the players.
116.72	So the game is about self-expression,
121.24	creativity,
122.52	not just overcoming the challenges
122.52	posed by the simulation.
127.16	It is about showing
127.16	what your cities look like.
132.48	So I have a couple of videos.
134.6	These are from YouTube.
136.44	And these are some of the most
136.44	interesting city designs I have seen.
140.919	So they are all different,
142.44	and I hope you like all of these.
147.04	This one is called The Netherlands.
149.4	It's by Silvarret.
151.36	And when you start the game,
153.52	you have an empty piece of land.
156.16	This land, it can be based
156.16	on the real world,
160.08	it can be hand-crafted in the map editor,
163.04	or you can, of course, download
163.04	a city made by someone else
166.04	and play in that.
167.6	But what Silvarret has done here
170.04	is that what he wanted to make
172.64	was not a real city.
175.4	This is a fantasy city,
177.08	even though it looks real.
178.8	So what he wanted to do was a fantasy city
178.8	that could be in the Netherlands.
184.32	So he kind of investigated
186.68	what are the characteristics
186.68	of cities in the Netherlands
190.72	and combined a couple of those,
193.32	and this is what he created.
196.04	So it is a city,
197.72	but it is not a real city,
200	but it could be.
201.28	It looks just like the Netherlands.
203.56	So the places are really
203.56	densely populated.
206.96	So what you need is highways, trains,
211.96	anything connecting
211.96	these small town centers together.
216.24	Lots of people, lots of moving,
218.48	so transportation is the key here.
222.76	But then let's go even more
222.76	on the fantasy side.
226.24	Let's go into the future.
230.28	This is one of my personal favorites.
232.64	These city designs
232.64	are what I love the most.
237	So this is a tiered city by Conflictnerd,
240.32	and the basic idea is
240.32	that you have concentric circle routes.
246.24	So the city is a big circle
248.56	with tinier circles inside.
251.4	And the thing is that you put
251.4	all of the services in the center,
255.68	and then people actually live
255.68	on the outer ring,
259.12	because there is less traffic,
259.12	less noise, less pollution,
262.92	so that is where you want to live.
264.88	But the services
264.88	are still really close by.
267.84	They are in the center.
269.519	And this is the soul of the game.
273.36	The player has to understand
275.4	what are the wishes, what are the needs
278	of the tiny people living in the cities.
281.68	So you need to know
281.68	where you should put the things.
285.52	Like, it's not enough to have a hospital.
288.08	It needs to be accessible.
289.84	Citizens need to reach the hospital.
292.96	And this is one way to do it.
297.2	So maybe this is something
297.2	that we might be seeing someday.
302.2	And then even more into the future.
306.28	Astergea by Yuttho.
308.84	So Yuttho does YouTube videos
308.84	and plays the game.
312.64	What he did here
312.64	was actually a 12-point series
317.32	of creating this city.
320	So what he does is he plays the game,
322.56	he records it
323.84	and he explains as he's going
323.84	what he's doing and why.
328.16	And as a part of this series,
330.32	he actually did an interview
330.32	with an actual urban planner
333.6	called Jeff Speck.
335.96	And Speck is an expert
335.96	on the concept of walkability.
340.28	The basic idea is that
340.28	if you want your citizens to walk,
344.68	which is kind of beneficial,
346.64	you actually need to have walking
346.64	as a reasonable means of transportation.
352.4	It should be a good way to reach places.
355.76	So what Yuttho did
355.76	was that he explained this concept,
359.4	he had Speck explain it, too,
361.44	and then he applied it
361.44	to the city that he was building.
365.2	So what we are seeing
365.2	is Yuttho's vision of the future:
370.12	lots of public transportation,
370.12	walkways, plazas,
374.4	connecting high-rise buildings.
376.8	Maybe this is what
376.8	the future might look like.
380.4	And the game system
380.4	works really well for this.
383.88	We are seeing some
383.88	real-world uses to this game.
388.72	So we know that some urban planners
388.72	are using it as a sketching tool,
393.44	so while the simulation
393.44	is not completely realistic,
397.76	it is realistic enough
397.76	that if something works in the game,
401.72	it is highly likely that it
401.72	will also work in the real world,
406.64	so that you can actually try out things,
408.76	see if this intersection
408.76	might fit this kind of a situation.
413.76	If we build a new road, would it help?
417.32	And this is what you can do
417.32	with this game.
421.08	There was one really
421.08	interesting contest held
424.2	by the Finnish city of HÃ¤meenlinna.
427.44	So what they did
427.44	was that they had a new area
429.68	that they wanted to develop in the city.
432.96	They made a map with the existing city,
435.52	they left empty the area
435.52	that they would want to develop
438.72	and shared this map.
441.08	So anyone could download the map,
444.12	play the game, build the area
445.76	and submit their creations
445.76	to the city council.
450.28	So they have not yet built anything,
452.92	but it might just be
452.92	that they use one of these plans
456.72	made with the game
459.08	to actually build the real city.
464.08	And these videos that I have shown you,
466.8	these are the people who are
466.8	coming up with new kinds of solutions.
472	We know that cities are growing.
473.88	They're getting bigger as we go,
476.36	and the percentage of population
476.36	living in cities is projected to rise.
482.6	So we need the solutions
484.52	and these people, playing the game,
487.24	they are trying out
487.24	different kinds of solutions.
489.92	They might have something
489.92	that is really important.
494.64	So what we are seeing here is dream cities
494.64	that might be real one day.
502.4	So it might be
504	that this is not just a game.
508	It might be a way
510.68	to decide our own fate.
513.92	Thank you.
515.16	(Applause)
