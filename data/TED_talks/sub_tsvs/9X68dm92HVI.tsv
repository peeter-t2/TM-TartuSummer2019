16.477	I'll tell you a little bit
16.477	about irrational behavior.
19.16	Not yours, of course -- other people's.
21.065	(Laughter)
22.271	So after being at MIT for a few years,
26.16	I realized that writing academic papers
26.16	is not that exciting.
30.841	You know, I don't know
30.841	how many of those you read,
33.223	but it's not fun to read
33.223	and often not fun to write --
35.782	even worse to write.
37.16	So I decided to try and write
37.16	something more fun.
40.16	And I came up with an idea
40.16	that I would write a cookbook.
44.971	And the title for my cookbook
44.971	was going to be,
47.147	"""Dining Without Crumbs:"
47.147	"The Art of Eating Over the Sink."""
50.031	(Laughter)
51.777	And it was going to be a look
51.777	at life through the kitchen.
54.706	I was quite excited about this.
56.285	I was going to talk
56.285	a little bit about research,
58.578	a little bit about the kitchen.
60.099	We do so much in the kitchen,
60.099	I thought this would be interesting.
63.242	I wrote a couple of chapters,
63.242	and took it to MIT Press and they said,
67.158	"""Cute, but not for us."
67.158	"Go and find somebody else."""
70.276	I tried other people,
70.276	and everybody said the same thing,
73.181	"""Cute. Not for us."""
75.276	Until somebody said,
78.16	"""Look, if you're serious about this,"
80.01	you have to write about your research
80.01	first; you have to publish something,
83.565	then you'll get the opportunity
83.565	to write something else.
86.287	If you really want to do it,
86.287	"you have to do it."""
88.582	"I said, ""I don't want to write"
88.582	about my research.
90.951	I do it all day long,
92.192	I want to write something
92.192	"a bit more free, less constrained."""
95.708	And this person
95.708	was very forceful and said,
98.16	"""Look, that's the only way"
98.16	"you'll ever do it."""
100.76	"So I said, ""Okay, if I have to do it --"""
103.094	I had a sabbatical.
104.277	"I said, ""I'll write about my research,"
104.277	if there's no other way.
107.26	"And then I'll get to do my cookbook."""
109.086	So, I wrote a book on my research.
112.346	And it turned out to be
112.346	quite fun in two ways.
114.941	First of all, I enjoyed writing.
117.489	But the more interesting thing
117.489	was that I started learning from people.
121.267	It's a fantastic time to write,
122.876	because there's so much feedback
122.876	you can get from people.
125.605	People write to me
125.605	about their personal experience,
128.16	and about their examples,
128.16	and where they disagree,
130.518	and their nuances.
132.16	And even being here --
132.16	I mean, the last few days,
134.47	I've known heights of obsessive behavior
137.16	I never thought about.
139.16	(Laughter)
140.816	Which I think is just fascinating.
142.732	I will tell you a little bit
142.732	about irrational behavior,
145.351	and I want to start by giving you
145.351	some examples of visual illusion
148.553	as a metaphor for rationality.
150.51	So think about these two tables.
152.352	And you must have seen this illusion.
154.16	If I asked you what's longer, the vertical
154.16	line on the table on the left,
158.005	or the horizontal line
158.005	on the table on the right,
160.822	which one seems longer?
163.16	Can anybody see anything
163.16	but the left one being longer?
166.159	No, right? It's impossible.
168.03	But the nice thing about visual illusion
168.03	is we can easily demonstrate mistakes.
171.946	So I can put some lines
171.946	on; it doesn't help.
174.433	I can animate the lines.
176.159	And to the extent you believe
176.159	I didn't shrink the lines,
178.851	which I didn't, I've proven to you
178.851	that your eyes were deceiving you.
183.663	Now, the interesting thing about this
183.663	is when I take the lines away,
187.16	it's as if you haven't learned
187.16	anything in the last minute.
189.994	(Laughter)
192.238	You can't look at this and say,
192.238	"""Now I see reality as it is."""
195.953	Right? It's impossible to overcome
195.953	this sense that this is indeed longer.
200.017	Our intuition is really fooling us
201.668	in a repeatable,
201.668	predictable, consistent way.
203.839	and there is almost nothing
203.839	we can do about it,
206.16	aside from taking a ruler
206.16	and starting to measure it.
209.77	Here's another one.
209.77	It's one of my favorite illusions.
212.358	What color is the top arrow pointing to?
216.119	Audience: Brown.
216.119	Dan Ariely: Brown. Thank you.
218.315	The bottom one? Yellow.
220.308	Turns out they're identical.
221.673	Can anybody see them as identical?
223.608	Very, very hard.
225.006	I can cover the rest of the cube up.
227.16	If I cover the rest of the cube,
227.16	you can see that they are identical.
230.59	If you don't believe me,
230.59	you can get the slide later
233.051	and do some arts and crafts
233.051	and see that they're identical.
235.891	But again, it's the same story,
235.891	that if we take the background away,
239.248	the illusion comes back.
241.477	There is no way for us not
241.477	to see this illusion.
244.478	I guess maybe if you're colorblind,
244.478	I don't think you can see that.
247.819	I want you to think
247.819	about illusion as a metaphor.
250.16	Vision is one of the best things we do.
252.319	We have a huge part of our brain
252.319	dedicated to vision --
254.939	bigger than dedicated to anything else.
256.858	We use our vision more hours
256.858	of the day than anything else.
260.73	We're evolutionarily
260.73	designed to use vision.
262.824	And if we have these predictable
262.824	repeatable mistakes in vision,
265.824	which we're so good at,
267.354	what are the chances we won't make
267.354	even more mistakes
269.942	in something we're not as good at,
269.942	for example, financial decision-making.
273.517	(Laughter)
275.16	Something we don't have
275.16	an evolutionary reason to do,
277.834	we don't have a specialized
277.834	part of the brain for,
280.208	and we don't do that many
280.208	hours of the day.
282.247	The argument is in those cases,
284.239	it might be that we actually
284.239	make many more mistakes.
288.16	And worse -- not having
288.16	an easy way to see them,
290.957	because in visual illusions, we can
290.957	easily demonstrate the mistakes;
294.21	in cognitive illusion
294.21	it's much, much harder
296.321	to demonstrate the mistakes to people.
298.16	So I want to show you
298.16	some cognitive illusions,
301.16	or decision-making illusions,
301.16	in the same way.
304.266	And this is one of my favorite
304.266	plots in social sciences.
307.766	It's from a paper
307.766	by Johnson and Goldstein.
311.628	It basically shows the percentage
311.628	of people who indicated
315.35	they would be interested
315.35	in donating their organs.
319.104	These are different countries in Europe.
321.053	You basically see two types of countries:
323.038	countries on the right,
323.038	that seem to be giving a lot;
325.664	and countries on the left
325.664	that seem to giving very little,
328.647	or much less.
330.274	The question is, why?
331.45	Why do some countries give a lot
331.45	and some countries give a little?
334.798	When you ask people this question,
336.45	they usually think that it has
336.45	to be about culture.
339.006	How much do you care about people?
340.656	Giving organs to somebody else
342.16	is probably about how much you care
342.16	about society, how linked you are.
345.518	Or maybe it's about religion.
347.16	But if you look at this plot,
349.139	you can see that countries
349.139	that we think about as very similar,
352.59	actually exhibit very different behavior.
355.368	For example, Sweden
355.368	is all the way on the right,
357.653	and Denmark, which we think
357.653	is culturally very similar,
360.336	is all the way on the left.
362.16	Germany is on the left,
362.16	and Austria is on the right.
366.16	The Netherlands is on the left,
366.16	and Belgium is on the right.
369.5	And finally, depending
369.5	on your particular version
372.16	of European similarity,
374.16	you can think about the U.K. and France
374.16	as either similar culturally or not,
379.35	but it turns out that with organ
379.35	donation, they are very different.
383.198	By the way, the Netherlands
383.198	is an interesting story.
385.661	You see, the Netherlands is kind
385.661	of the biggest of the small group.
390.494	It turns out that they got to 28 percent
393.16	after mailing every household
393.16	in the country a letter,
396.463	begging people to join
396.463	this organ donation program.
399.672	You know the expression,
399.672	"""Begging only gets you so far."""
402.664	It's 28 percent in organ donation.
405.16	(Laughter)
407.433	But whatever the countries
407.433	on the right are doing,
409.807	they're doing a much
409.807	better job than begging.
411.942	So what are they doing?
413.274	Turns out the secret has to do
413.274	with a form at the DMV.
416.766	And here is the story.
418.16	The countries on the left
418.16	have a form at the DMV
420.691	that looks something like this.
422.406	"""Check the box below if you want to"
422.406	"participate in the organ donor program."""
426.715	And what happens?
428.16	People don't check, and they don't join.
431.16	The countries on the right,
431.16	the ones that give a lot,
433.686	have a slightly different form.
435.312	"It says, ""Check the box below"
435.312	"if you don't want to participate ..."""
438.836	Interestingly enough,
438.836	when people get this,
441.05	they again don't check, but now they join.
443.16	(Laughter)
446.16	Now, think about what this means.
449.566	You know, we wake up in the morning
449.566	and we feel we make decisions.
453.16	We wake up in the morning
453.16	and we open the closet;
455.494	we feel that we decide what to wear.
457.302	we open the refrigerator and we feel
457.302	that we decide what to eat.
460.398	What this is actually saying,
461.921	is that many of these decisions
461.921	are not residing within us.
464.755	They are residing in the person
464.755	who is designing that form.
467.881	When you walk into the DMV,
469.851	the person who designed the form
469.851	will have a huge influence
472.874	on what you'll end up doing.
474.707	Now, it's also very hard
474.707	to intuit these results.
477.51	Think about it for yourself.
478.875	How many of you believe
480.16	that if you went to renew
480.16	your license tomorrow,
482.47	and you went to the DMV,
484.16	and you encountered one of these forms,
486.451	that it would actually
486.451	change your own behavior?
488.936	Very hard to think
488.936	that it would influence us.
491.267	"We can say, ""Oh, these funny Europeans,"
491.267	"of course it would influence them."""
494.83	But when it comes to us,
496.617	we have such a feeling
496.617	that we're in the driver's seat,
499.279	such a feeling that we're in control
499.279	and we are making the decision,
502.592	that it's very hard
502.592	to even accept the idea
505.215	that we actually have an illusion
505.215	of making a decision,
507.914	rather than an actual decision.
510.002	Now, you might say,
512.494	"""These are decisions we don't care about."""
514.935	In fact, by definition,
514.935	these are decisions
517.232	about something that will happen
517.232	to us after we die.
519.839	How could we care about something less
521.983	than about something
521.983	that happens after we die?
524.296	So a standard economist,
524.296	somebody who believes in rationality,
527.242	"would say, ""You know what?"
528.519	The cost of lifting the pencil
528.519	"and marking a ""V"" is higher"
531.995	than the possible benefit of the decision,
534.16	"so that's why we get this effect."""
535.982	(Laughter)
537.015	But, in fact, it's not because it's easy.
539.537	It's not because it's trivial.
539.537	It's not because we don't care.
542.577	It's the opposite. It's because we care.
545.022	It's difficult and it's complex.
546.99	And it's so complex
546.99	that we don't know what to do.
549.565	And because we have no idea what to do,
551.565	we just pick whatever it was
551.565	that was chosen for us.
555.769	I'll give you one more example.
557.334	This is from a paper
557.334	by Redelmeier and Shafir.
559.945	"And they said, ""Would this"
559.945	effect also happens to experts?
563.475	People who are well-paid,
563.475	experts in their decisions,
566.627	"and who make a lot of them?"""
568.007	And they took a group of physicians.
570.216	They presented to them
570.216	a case study of a patient.
572.692	"They said, ""Here is a patient."
572.692	He is a 67-year-old farmer.
576.16	He's been suffering from
576.16	"right hip pain for a while."""
578.914	And then, they said to the physicians,
580.772	"""You decided a few weeks ago"
582.16	that nothing is working for this patient.
584.16	All these medications,
584.16	nothing seems to be working.
586.613	So you refer the patient
586.613	for hip replacement therapy.
589.409	"Hip replacement. Okay?"""
591.16	So the patient is on a path
591.16	to have his hip replaced.
594.616	Then they said to half of the physicians,
596.609	"""Yesterday, you reviewed"
596.609	the patient's case,
598.972	and you realized that you forgot
598.972	to try one medication.
601.606	You did not try ibuprofen.
604.16	What do you do? Do you pull
604.16	the patient back and try ibuprofen?
607.509	Or do you let him go
607.509	"and have hip replacement?"""
610.303	Well, the good news is
610.303	that most physicians in this case
612.978	decided to pull the patient
612.978	and try ibuprofen.
615.811	Very good for the physicians.
617.575	To the other group
617.575	of physicians, they said,
619.666	"""Yesterday when you reviewed the case,"
619.666	you discovered there were two medications
623.539	you didn't try out yet --
623.539	"ibuprofen and piroxicam."""
626.079	You have two medications
626.079	you didn't try out yet.
628.354	What do you do? You let him go,
628.354	or you pull him back?
631.021	And if you pull him back, do you try
631.021	"ibuprofen or piroxicam? Which one?"""
634.489	Now, think of it:
635.669	This decision makes it as easy to let
635.669	the patient continue with hip replacement,
639.565	but pulling him back, all of the sudden
639.565	it becomes more complex.
642.715	There is one more decision.
644.557	What happens now?
645.907	The majority of the physicians
645.907	now choose to let the patient go
649.55	for a hip replacement.
651.091	I hope this worries you, by the way --
653.16	(Laughter)
654.417	when you go to see your physician.
656.782	The thing is that
656.782	no physician would ever say,
659.528	"""Piroxicam, ibuprofen, hip replacement."
659.528	"Let's go for hip replacement."""
663.345	But the moment you set this
663.345	as the default,
666.16	it has a huge power over whatever
666.16	people end up doing.
670.16	I'll give you a couple of more examples
670.16	on irrational decision-making.
673.518	Imagine I give you a choice:
675.36	Do you want to go for a weekend to Rome,
675.36	all expenses paid --
678.997	hotel, transportation, food,
678.997	a continental breakfast, everything --
683.583	or a weekend in Paris?
685.16	Now, weekend in Paris, weekend
685.16	in Rome -- these are different things.
688.438	They have different food,
688.438	different culture, different art.
691.24	Imagine I added a choice to the set
691.24	that nobody wanted.
694.62	"Imagine I said, ""A weekend in Rome,"
696.396	a weekend in Paris,
697.788	"or having your car stolen?"""
699.404	(Laughter)
702.461	It's a funny idea, because why
702.461	would having your car stolen,
705.731	in this set, influence anything?
707.351	(Laughter)
709.489	But what if the option to have your car
709.489	stolen was not exactly like this?
713.962	What if it was a trip to Rome,
713.962	all expenses paid,
716.518	transportation, breakfast,
718.82	but it doesn't include
718.82	coffee in the morning?
721.16	If you want coffee, you have to pay
721.16	for it yourself, it's two euros 50.
724.557	(Laughter)
725.588	Now in some ways,
727.16	given that you can have Rome with coffee,
729.483	why would you possibly
729.483	want Rome without coffee?
731.888	It's like having your car stolen.
731.888	It's an inferior option.
735.474	But guess what happened?
736.65	The moment you add Rome without coffee,
738.985	Rome with coffee becomes more popular,
738.985	and people choose it.
742.627	The fact that you have Rome without coffee
745.16	makes Rome with coffee look superior,
747.16	and not just to Rome without coffee --
747.16	even superior to Paris.
750.16	(Laughter)
754.261	Here are two examples of this principle.
756.737	This was an ad in The Economist
756.737	a few years ago
759.413	that gave us three choices:
761.517	an online subscription for 59 dollars,
764.374	a print subscription for 125 dollars,
767.883	or you could get both for 125.
770.16	(Laughter)
772.16	Now I looked at this,
772.16	and I called up The Economist,
774.769	and I tried to figure out
774.769	what they were thinking.
777.356	And they passed me from one person
777.356	to another to another,
780.522	until eventually I got to the person
780.522	who was in charge of the website,
784.269	and I called them up, and they went
784.269	to check what was going on.
787.888	The next thing I know,
787.888	the ad is gone, no explanation.
791.759	So I decided to do the experiment
793.67	that I would have loved
793.67	The Economist to do with me.
796.336	I took this and I gave it
796.336	to 100 MIT students.
798.759	"I said, ""What would you choose?"""
800.347	These are the market shares --
800.347	most people wanted the combo deal.
804.357	Thankfully, nobody wanted
804.357	the dominant option.
806.589	That means our students can read.
808.253	(Laughter)
809.659	But now, if you have an option
809.659	that nobody wants,
812.572	you can take it off, right?
814.295	So I printed another version of this,
816.16	where I eliminated the middle option.
818.001	I gave it to another 100 students.
818.001	Here is what happened:
821.508	Now the most popular option
821.508	became the least popular,
824.269	and the least popular
824.269	became the most popular.
827.801	What was happening
827.801	was the option that was useless,
831.16	in the middle, was useless
831.16	in the sense that nobody wanted it.
835.035	But it wasn't useless in the sense
835.035	that it helped people figure out
838.225	what they wanted.
839.4	In fact, relative
839.4	to the option in the middle,
842.16	which was get only the print for 125,
846.683	the print and web for 125
846.683	looked like a fantastic deal.
850.46	And as a consequence, people chose it.
852.587	The general idea here, by the way,
854.238	is that we actually don't know
854.238	our preferences that well.
856.953	And because we don't know
856.953	our preferences that well,
859.447	we're susceptible to all of these
859.447	influences from the external forces:
862.76	the defaults, the particular options
862.76	that are presented to us, and so on.
866.792	One more example of this.
868.16	People believe that when we deal
868.16	with physical attraction,
871.541	we see somebody, and we know immediately
871.541	whether we like them or not,
874.828	if we're attracted or not.
876.16	This is why we have
876.16	these four-minute dates.
878.616	So I decided to do
878.616	this experiment with people.
881.16	I'll show you images here, no real people,
881.16	but the experiment was with people.
885.16	I showed some people a picture
885.16	of Tom, and a picture of Jerry.
888.16	"and I said, ""Who do you want to date?"
890.253	"Tom or Jerry?"""
891.752	But for half the people,
891.752	I added an ugly version of Jerry.
895.055	I took Photoshop and I made
895.055	Jerry slightly less attractive.
900.16	(Laughter)
901.597	For the other people, I added
901.597	an ugly version of Tom.
905.16	And the question was,
905.16	will ugly Jerry and ugly Tom
908.16	help their respective,
908.16	more attractive brothers?
911.952	The answer was absolutely yes.
914.205	When ugly Jerry was around,
914.205	Jerry was popular.
916.375	When ugly Tom was around, Tom was popular.
918.539	(Laughter)
920.16	This of course has two
920.16	very clear implications
922.696	for life in general.
925.95	If you ever go bar-hopping,
925.95	who do you want to take with you?
929.16	(Laughter)
934.913	You want a slightly uglier
934.913	version of yourself.
938.714	(Laughter)
940.16	Similar, but slightly uglier.
942.421	(Laughter)
943.888	The second point, or course, is that
943.888	if somebody invites you to bar hop,
947.681	you know what they think about you.
949.452	(Laughter)
952.16	Now you get it.
954.466	What is the general point?
956.16	The general point is that,
957.442	when we think about economics, we have
957.442	this beautiful view of human nature.
961.16	"""What a piece of work is a man!"
961.16	"How noble in reason!"""
963.721	We have this view of ourselves, of others.
966.323	The behavioral economics perspective
966.323	"is slightly less ""generous"" to people;"
971.561	in fact, in medical terms,
973.684	that's our view.
974.9	(Laughter)
980.051	But there is a silver lining.
982.16	The silver lining is, I think,
984.058	kind of the reason that behavioral
984.058	economics is interesting and exciting.
988.16	Are we Superman, or are we Homer Simpson?
991.446	When it comes to building
991.446	the physical world,
994.461	we kind of understand our limitations.
996.517	We build steps.
997.712	And we build these things
997.712	that not everybody can use, obviously.
1000.879	(Laughter)
1002.799	We understand our limitations,
1004.37	and we build around them.
1006.044	But for some reason, when it comes
1006.044	to the mental world,
1008.647	when we design things like healthcare
1008.647	and retirement and stock markets,
1012.028	we somehow forget the idea
1012.028	that we are limited.
1014.4	I think that if we understood
1014.4	our cognitive limitations
1017.331	in the same way we understand
1017.331	our physical limitations,
1019.967	even though they don't stare us
1019.967	in the face the same way,
1022.801	we could design a better world,
1022.801	and that, I think,
1025.305	is the hope of this thing.
1026.722	Thank you very much.
1028.16	(Applause)
