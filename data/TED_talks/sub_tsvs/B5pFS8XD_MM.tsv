12.82	This is my favorite place on earth,
15.518	Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia.
19.612	And when it's covered
19.612	in a thin layer of water,
22.252	it reflects the clouds.
23.443	There are days when you feel
23.443	as if you're floating among the clouds.
28.372	But there are days
28.372	when the horizon disappears;
31.293	there's no longer a top or a bottom.
33.737	You feel immersed in something bigger.
38.297	It was there that one night
38.297	I woke up from a dream,
42.265	and I saw that the stars
42.265	were also reflected on the water.
45.863	And that wasn't a dream.
47.281	It was as if you could walk
47.281	among the stars.
50.118	With every step I took,
50.118	the stars reverberated under my feet.
53.489	It was like I was floating in the universe
53.489	among clouds of galaxies.
59.599	But what's floating there today
59.599	are not just clouds of galaxies
62.827	but also clouds of plastic.
65.033	These are the footprints
65.033	we're leaving on the planet.
68.65	They're signs of an era
70.85	in which the behavior of some humans
70.85	is making a global impact
74.828	on our ecosystems.
78.077	This era is called the Anthropocene.
81.142	There's also another type
81.142	of toxic clouds that float in the air,
84.848	like the ones that form
84.848	from carbon dioxide emissions
87.808	and from the burning of fossil fuels --
87.808	oil, carbon, gas --
91.271	clouds that, when we see them,
93.485	pollute our dreams.
95.875	I don't know about all of you,
97.718	but I've always dreamed of floating
97.718	among the clouds.
100.354	Maybe today we can imagine together
100.354	other types of clouds,
103.951	clouds we can live with.
106.37	If you're wondering
106.37	about that photo, I'll explain:
109.015	it looks like a collage
109.015	or photomontage -- something weird.
111.982	No; it's reality.
113.362	But sometimes I ask myself:
113.362	What is reality?
115.912	According to Alexander Kluge:
117.605	"""Human beings are not"
117.605	interested in reality.
120.193	They can’t be; it’s part
120.193	of the human essence.
123.475	They have desires.
125.797	These desires are totally opposed
125.797	to any form of reality.
129.225	They prefer to lie
130.941	than to become divorced
130.941	"from their desires."""
134.339	But how can we learn
134.339	to float among the clouds?
138.817	As an artist, I thought we could start
138.817	building a flying museum.
144.278	You're probably wondering:
144.278	With plastic bags?
146.446	In 2007, with a community of people
146.446	all over the world,
149.41	we began to collect used plastic bags --
152.312	not new ones.
153.9	And we washed them,
156.685	we cut them up,
158.142	we glued them together,
159.593	and we began to draw on them,
161.561	creating a huge canvas.
163.408	We made a collection of drawings,
165.432	of personal stories
166.734	and of friendships.
168.362	And when you join them,
170.198	bend them and fold them,
172.222	it creates a space full of air.
174.617	When the sun comes up from the horizon,
178.139	the museum rises up to the sky.
180.017	That's why we call it,
180.017	"""The Aero-Solar Museum."""
182.352	And from this simple idea,
183.693	we learned how to float in the air
183.693	in a radically new way,
186.604	without using any type of fuel.
188.848	The difference in temperature
188.848	between the interior and the exterior
192.563	is what makes us rise up.
194.587	That way,
197.136	we don't use fossil fuels
197.136	or helium or hydrogen;
201.323	we don't use solar panels
203.513	or batteries or motors.
206.068	We discovered a way that's simple,
206.068	clean and accessible to the whole world
211.382	to lift ourselves up.
212.796	I remember when I was at NASA in 2009
212.796	with 120 engineers.
218.203	You guys know, too,
218.203	when you go up in a plane,
220.839	the control panels are gigantic.
222.926	And what we're doing is really complex,
226.566	and when I started coming in
226.566	with the plastic bags, saying,
229.562	"""But we have a different way ..."""
231.245	people had a hard time
231.245	understanding the concept.
233.609	Seeing the power of this idea,
235.177	we started to initiate a new era;
236.84	one that would leave behind
236.84	the violence of the Anthropocene
239.838	and give way to a new era,
241.349	"which we call the ""Aerocene"" --"
243.443	an era of ecological awareness,
246.283	in which we learn to float together,
246.283	live together in the air,
249.484	and come to an ethical commitment
251.173	with the atmosphere and with planet earth.
254.297	That's why I've brought
254.297	this backpack today.
256.442	Let's see ...
266.816	OK. This is a balloon
266.816	that we also refer to as a sculpture.
270.228	And if it's sunny out tomorrow,
270.228	we can go out and fly --
273.142	though, no, the weather
273.142	in Vancouver isn't --
275.478	(Laughter)
276.958	it's not very ...
279.05	very favorable.
281.346	So, what other features does it have?
283.443	It has sensors that, when it moves,
285.83	make sort of drawings in the air.
288.941	It also has other sensors.
290.537	I always think that first
290.537	you have to feel it,
292.761	and then you can measure it;
294.875	you need to hear the sounds
294.875	of the atmosphere,
297.169	of the climate, of the hot air,
298.727	in order to then measure the ozone,
300.822	the carbon dioxide.
302.639	We're developing these sensors
304.204	together with different communities
304.204	all over the world
306.905	in order to reconnect with the climate,
306.905	the temperature and the environment,
310.734	because there are other
310.734	species in the air;
312.972	in these excursions
312.972	towards the atmosphere,
315.044	we're not alone.
316.231	The air is full of clouds of life.
318.015	We live at the bottom of an ocean of air.
320.875	And this same sculpture,
324.522	this exact one in my hands,
325.904	flew 375 miles -- 12 hours --
325.904	from Germany to Poland,
328.705	on a fuel-free trip.
329.907	But it wasn't free from crossing borders.
332.084	The trip was much more complicated
332.084	than what we imagined;
334.974	air space is as regulated and militarized
337.458	as land space.
339.243	To fly using the winds,
339.243	the heat of the sun
341.716	and the radiant energy of the earth
343.478	is complex and beautiful.
345.763	But even more complex
345.763	will be getting the permits
348.161	to cross the air space
348.161	of each of the different countries
351.225	that we fly over using wind.
353.614	At COP21, the Paris Climate Conference,
357.441	we presented these spherical sculptures
359.587	that could transport us
359.587	all over the world.
362.137	But how can we fly using the wind
362.137	to arrive at our destination?
366.043	Together with MIT, we developed a program
368.516	that predicts how we can navigate
368.516	the wind highways.
371.62	For example, if I had to return
371.62	to Berlin from Vancouver,
375.665	the first thing I would need to do
375.665	is choose an altitude.
378.38	At different altitudes,
378.38	there are different directions
381.712	and different speeds.
383.855	The red line is tomorrow
383.855	and the orange, the day after tomorrow.
387.002	And there it goes.
388.194	You can see, the best day
388.194	to fly back to Berlin --
392.414	so now, traveling using only wind --
395.934	is in six days.
397.399	And we can get to 105 miles
397.399	from the center of Berlin
400.481	without burning a single drop of fuel,
402.414	being transported only by wind currents.
405.325	So we thought that these trajectories
405.325	that we drew with the wind
409.227	could become signatures, declaring
409.227	"""Independence from Fossil Fuels Day."""
414.508	More and more of us
414.508	are experiencing the air
417.222	in a different way.
418.959	You're all familiar with Earth Day.
421.104	We think we should also celebrate Air Day:
423.868	it's a pact that we make with the earth,
425.878	an ethical commitment to the atmosphere.
429.673	But let's keep thinking and dreaming.
431.749	We've learned that the bigger
431.749	the sculptures are,
436.019	the more weight they can lift.
438.701	Remember,
440.467	they rise up only with hot air
440.467	that's been heated by the sun.
445.968	Using this approach, we can learn
445.968	to build gardens in the air.
449.579	Could we one day live in a garden
449.579	the size of the earth?
453.268	Could we live in an ecosystem
453.268	floating among the clouds?
457.264	Answering these questions
457.264	isn't just a technological challenge;
460.915	it's a way to reexamine
460.915	the freedom of movement between countries,
466.122	and of overcoming the political,
466.122	social, cultural and military restrictions
469.933	of contemporary societies.
471.645	Because in the end,
473.342	the air belongs to everybody
475.063	and doesn't answer to any government.
478.364	(Applause)
485.208	And like we said earlier,
486.553	our imagination is the force
486.553	that allows us to create these places.
490.708	This is an installation I did
492.423	at the Metropolitan Museum
492.423	of Art in New York.
494.854	It asks the question:
496.155	What might these transnational
496.155	spaces be like?
498.923	And once we inhabit those spaces,
498.923	we need to learn how to move within them,
503.859	to walk among the clouds,
506.391	where every movement affects
506.391	everyone else's movements;
509.788	the body weight and proximity
509.788	between people
512.989	will cause the space to expand ...
515.037	or contract.
518.25	There we are, suspended
521.369	When two or more people
521.369	get too close together,
524.607	even those farthest away are affected --
528.036	everyone falls to the same spot.
530.361	These are fragile ecosystems.
533.763	And it's between these spheres
533.763	that we build nets that connect us.
538.133	There are moments
538.133	when we have to face the void,
541.575	and fear can paralyze us.
544.279	One of the most beautiful things
544.279	about this exhibit
546.756	is the sense of solidarity generated
548.557	"when we face these new ""aero-graphs."""
551.713	Finally,
553.293	let me tell you one last story.
555.317	On July 16, 1945,
557.515	on the White Sands of New Mexico,
559.539	an atomic bomb was detonated
559.539	for the first time.
563.523	As a result of this explosion,
565.155	a cloud of radioactive particles
565.155	disseminated all over the earth,
569.753	marking the beginning
569.753	of the Anthropocene era.
573.36	Seventy years later, on November 8, 2015,
576.581	in the same place,
578.159	another event occurred.
580.381	For the first time in history,
582.159	we lifted a person into the air
582.159	using only the sun,
585.341	without burning any fossil fuels.
588.138	As the sun rose up above the horizon,
590.664	we rose up, too,
592.325	silently,
594.013	slowly,
595.204	with no explosions.
596.734	We felt as if gravity had been inverted;
599.945	it wasn't pulling us
599.945	toward the center of the earth,
602.795	but toward the universe.
605.201	If Neil Armstrong said,
605.201	when he walked on the moon,
607.86	"""That's one small step for man,"
609.65	"one giant leap for mankind,"""
612.451	perhaps what we ought to ask ourselves is:
614.475	What steps do we need to take today?
617.199	In the Aerocene era,
619.655	our steps are much smaller,
619.655	but radically different;
623.88	they're steps that began with a bag
623.88	full of air and wishes,
629.1	but that can carry us
629.1	to independence from fossil fuels
633.054	and the opportunity to celebrate Air Day;
635.087	steps that won't leave footprints
635.087	on other planets
638.428	until we've learned to walk
638.428	in the atmosphere of this one.
642.703	The landscapes are tiny
644.782	and the steps are tiny,
646.376	but I hope we can take them together.
648.798	And I'm sure that these steps will lead us
648.798	much further than the moon,
652.646	so we can learn to float
652.646	with our feet on the ground.
656.57	Thank you.
657.756	(Applause)
