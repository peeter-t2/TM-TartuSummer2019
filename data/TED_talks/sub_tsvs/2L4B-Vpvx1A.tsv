12.705	So imagine, you're in the supermarket,
15.355	you're buying some groceries,
16.936	and you get given the option
18.561	for a plastic or a paper shopping bag.
22.196	Which one do you choose if you want to do
24.386	the right thing by the environment?
26.802	Most people do pick the paper.
28.683	Okay, let's think of why.
29.911	It's brown to start with.
31.604	Therefore, it must be good for the environment.
33.08	It's biodegradable. It's reusable.
35.598	In some cases, it's recyclable.
37.548	So when people are looking at the plastic bag,
40.342	it's likely they're thinking of something like this,
43.272	which we all know is absolutely terrible,
45.655	and we should be avoiding at all expenses
47.871	these kinds of environmental damages.
50.226	But people are often not thinking
52.439	of something like this,
54.457	which is the other end of the spectrum.
57.035	When we produce materials,
59.802	we need to extract them from the environment,
61.432	and we need a whole bunch
61.432	of environmental impacts.
65.336	You see, what happens is, when we need
67.512	to make complex choices,
69.489	us humans like really simple solutions,
71.91	and so we often ask for simple solutions.
74.526	And I work in design.
75.999	I advise designers
77.51	and innovators around sustainability,
79.775	"and everyone always says to me, ""Oh Leyla,"
81.329	"I just want the eco-materials."""
83.251	"And I say, ""Well, that's very complex,"
85.535	and we'll have to spend four hours talking about
87.364	what exactly an eco-material means,
89.279	because everything at some point
91.199	comes from nature,
93.144	and it's how you use the material
95.239	that dictates the environmental impact.
98.28	So what happens is, we have to rely
100.069	on some sort of intuitive framework
102.127	when we make decisions.
103.702	So I like to call that intuitive framework
106.032	our environmental folklore.
108.627	It's either the little voice
108.627	at the back of your head,
111.384	or it's that gut feeling you get
113.656	when you've done the right thing,
115.236	so when you've picked the paper bag
116.784	or when you've bought a fuel-efficient car.
119.899	And environmental folklore is a really important thing
122.858	because we're trying to do the right thing.
125.306	But how do we know if we're actually
127.65	reducing the net environmental impacts
129.973	that our actions as individuals and as professionals
133.314	and as a society are actually having
135.482	on the natural environment?
138.187	So the thing about environmental folklore is
140.03	it tends to be based on our experiences,
142.085	the things we've heard from other people.
143.816	It doesn't tend to be based
143.816	on any scientific framework.
146.456	And this is really hard, because we live
148.123	in incredibly complex systems.
150.143	We have the human systems
151.863	of how we communicate and interrelate
153.629	and have our whole constructed society,
156.144	We have the industrial systems,
156.144	which is essentially the entire economy,
160.037	and then all of that has to operate
161.89	within the biggest system,
163.415	and, I would argue, the most important,
165.507	the ecosystem.
167.163	And you see, the choices that we make
169.025	as an individual,
170.458	but the choices that we make
171.769	in every single job that we have,
173.928	no matter how high or low
173.928	you are in the pecking order,
176.548	has an impact on all of these systems.
179.599	And the thing is that we have to find ways
181.934	if we're actually going to address sustainability
183.873	of interlocking those complex systems
187.021	and making better choices that result
189.965	in net environmental gains.
192.549	What we need to do is we need to learn
194.197	to do more with less.
196.273	We have an increasing population,
198.164	and everybody likes their mobile phones,
199.998	especially in this situation here.
202.113	So we need to find innovative ways of solving
202.113	some of these problems that we face.
206.168	And that's where this process called
206.168	life cycle thinking comes in.
209.366	So essentially, everything that is created
212.053	goes through a series of life cycle stages,
214.564	and we use this scientific process
216.426	called life cycle assessment,
218.15	or in America, you guys say life cycle analysis,
220.891	in order to have a clearer picture of how
224.438	everything that we do in the
224.438	technical part of those systems
228.244	affects the natural environment.
230.025	So we go all the way back
231.995	to the extraction of raw materials,
234.198	and then we look at manufacturing,
236.015	we look at packaging and transportation,
237.874	use, and end of life,
239.524	and at every single one of these stages,
242.441	the things that we do
243.96	have an interaction with the natural environment,
245.791	and we can monitor how that interaction
248.279	is actually affecting the systems and services
252.009	that make life on Earth possible.
253.924	And through doing this,
255.56	we've learned some absolutely fascinating things.
259.85	And we've busted a bunch of myths.
261.563	So to start with, there's a word that's used a lot.
266.551	It's used a lot in marketing,
268.284	and it's used a lot, I think, in our conversation
270.284	when we're talking about sustainability,
272.217	and that's the word biodegradability.
274.663	Now biodegradability is a material property;
279.611	it is not a definition of environmental benefits.
282.859	Allow me to explain.
284.762	When something natural,
286.454	something that's made from a cellulose fiber
288.415	like a piece of bread, even, or any food waste,
291.943	or even a piece of paper,
294.231	when something natural ends up
296.045	in the natural environment, it degrades normally.
298.668	Its little carbon molecules that it stored up
300.532	as it was growing are naturally released
302.669	back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide,
305.249	but this is a net situation.
307.223	Most natural things
308.588	don't actually end up in nature.
310.195	Most of the things, the waste that 
310.195	we produce, end up in landfill.
313.609	Landfill is a different environment.
316.008	In landfill, those same carbon molecules
318.451	degrade in a different way,
319.969	because a landfill is anaerobic.
321.881	It's got no oxygen. It's tightly compacted and hot.
325.299	Those same molecules, they become methane,
327.647	and methane is a 25 times more potent
330.565	greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.
333.418	So our old lettuces and products
336.171	that we have thrown out that are made
337.75	out of biodegradable materials,
339.32	if they end up in landfill,
341.055	contribute to climate change.
343.081	You see, there are facilities now
344.473	that can actually capture that methane
346.177	and generate power,
347.615	displacing the need for fossil fuel power,
350.406	but we need to be smart about this.
351.871	We need to identify how we can start to leverage
355.036	these types of things that are already happening
357.34	and start to design systems and services
359.208	that alleviate these problems.
361.091	Because right now, what people do
361.091	is they turn around and they say,
364.336	"""Let's ban plastic bags. We'll give people paper"
366.895	"because that is better for the environment."""
368.822	But if you're throwing it in the bin,
370.24	and your local landfill facility
371.703	is just a normal one,
374.124	then we're having what's called a double negative.
379.03	I'm a product designer by trade.
382.194	I then did social science.
383.386	And so I'm absolutely fascinated
384.803	by consumer goods and how the consumer goods
386.802	that we have kind of become immune to
388.924	that fill our lives
390.162	have an impact on the natural environment.
391.97	And these guys are, like, serial offenders,
394.583	and I'm pretty sure everyone in this room
396.446	has a refrigerator.
398.076	Now America has this amazing ability
399.708	to keep growing refrigerators.
401.717	In the last few years, they've grown one cubic foot
403.695	on average, the standard size
405.543	of a refrigerator.
407.172	And the problem is, they're so big now,
409.631	it's easier for us to buy more food
411.825	that we can't eat or find.
413.816	I mean, I have things at the back of my refrigerator
415.442	that have been there for years, all right?
417.652	And so what happens is, we waste more food.
420.288	And as I was just explaining,
420.288	food waste is a problem.
423.633	In fact, here in the U.S., 40 percent
426.995	of food purchased for the home is wasted.
429.57	Half of the world's produced food is wasted.
433.905	That's the latest U.N. stats. Up to half of the food.
436.558	It's insane. It's 1.3 billion tons of food per annum.
441.095	And I blame it on the refrigerator,
443.099	well, especially in Western cultures,
444.627	because it makes it easier.
446.477	I mean, there's a lot of complex
446.477	systems going on here.
448.869	I don't want to make it so simplistic.
450.807	But the refrigerator is a serious contributor to this,
453.757	and one of the features of it
455.615	is the crisper drawer.
457.577	You all got crisper drawers?
459.078	The drawer that you put your lettuces in?
461.013	Lettuces have a habit of going soggy
462.933	in the crisper drawers, don't they?
464.729	Yeah? Soggy lettuces?
466.139	In the U.K., this is such a problem
468.139	that there was a government report a few years ago
469.837	that actually said the second biggest offender
472.857	of wasted food in the U.K. is the soggy lettuce.
475.274	It was called the Soggy Lettuce Report.
477.692	Okay? So this is a problem, people.
479.905	These poor little lettuces are getting thrown out
482.015	left, right and center because the crisper drawers
483.887	are not designed to actually keep things crisp.
486.646	Okay. You need a tight environment.
488.855	You need, like, an airless environment
490.985	to prevent the degrading that
490.985	would happen naturally.
493.71	But the crisper drawers, they're just a drawer
495.662	with a slightly better seal.
497.37	Anyway, I'm clearly obsessed.
499.457	Don't ever invite me over because I'll just
499.457	start going through your refrigerator
502.182	and looking at all sorts of things like that.
503.7	But essentially, this is a big problem.
505.619	Because when we lose something
505.619	like the lettuce from the system,
508.578	not only do we have that impact 
508.578	I just explained at the end of life,
512.114	but we actually have had to grow that lettuce.
514.77	The life cycle impact of that lettuce is astronomical.
518.041	We've had to clear land.
519.459	We've had to plant seeds, phosphorus,
521.616	fertilizers, nutrients, water, sunlight.
523.74	All of the embodied impacts in that lettuce
525.828	get lost from the system,
527.54	which makes it a far bigger environmental impact
530.151	than the loss of the energy from the fridge.
533.835	So we need to design things like this far better
537.1	if we're going to start addressing
537.1	serious environmental problems.
540.281	We could start with the crisper drawer and the size.
541.932	For those of you in the room who do design fridges,
543.684	that would be great.
545.177	The problem is, imagine if we
548.275	actually started to reconsider 
548.275	how we designed things.
550.925	So I look at the refrigerator as a sign of modernity,
554.532	but we actually haven't really changed the design
556.63	of them that much since the 1950s.
559.301	A little bit, but essentially they're still big boxes,
562.526	cold boxes that we store stuff in.
564.448	So imagine if we actually really started
566.268	to identify these problems and use that
569.013	as the foundation for finding innovative and elegant
572.95	design solutions that will solve those problems.
576.303	This is design-led system change,
578.528	design dictating the way in which the system
582.238	can be far more sustainable.
585.003	Forty percent food waste is a major problem.
587.097	Imagine if we designed fridges that halved that.
591.162	Another item that I find fascinating
593.513	is the electric tea kettle,
594.766	which I found out that
596.159	you don't do tea kettles in
596.159	this country, really, do you?
599.41	But that's really big in the U.K.
601.498	Ninety-seven percent of households
603.731	in the United Kingdom own an electric tea kettle.
606.663	So they're very popular.
608.27	And, I mean, if I were to work with a design firm
611.07	or a designer, and they were designing one of these,
613.322	and they wanted to do it eco,
614.561	they'd usually ask me two things.
616.479	"They'd say, ""Leyla, how do I"
616.479	"make it technically efficient?"""
619.523	Because obviously energy's
619.523	a problem with this product.
622.811	"Or, ""How do I make it green materials?"
625.876	How do I make the materials green
628.786	"in the manufacturing?"""
630.608	Would you ask me those questions?
632.411	They seem logical, right? Yeah.
635.21	"Well I'd say, ""You're looking at the wrong problems."""
637.769	Because the problem is with use.
639.927	It's with how people use the product.
642.602	Sixty-five percent of Brits
644.437	admit to over-filling their kettle
646.781	when they only need one cup of tea.
649.367	All of this extra water that's being boiled
652.11	requires energy, and it's been calculated
656.078	that in one day of extra energy use
659.116	from boiling kettles
660.659	is enough to light all of the streetlights
663.301	in England for a night.
665.924	But this is the thing.
668.042	This is what I call a product-person failure.
669.956	But we've got a product-system failure
669.956	going on with these little guys,
672.702	and they're so ubiquitous, you 
672.702	don't even notice they're there.
675.612	And this guy over here, though, he does.
675.612	He's named Simon.
678.825	Simon works for the national
678.825	electricity company in the U.K.
682.132	He has a very important job of monitoring
684.274	all of the electricity coming into the system
686.713	to make sure there is enough
688.126	so it powers everybody's homes.
690.054	He's also watching television.
692.158	The reason is because there's a unique
694.131	phenomenon that happens in the U.K.
695.949	the moment that very popular TV shows end.
699.987	The minute the ad break comes on,
702.225	this man has to rush
704.062	to buy nuclear power from France,
707.118	because everybody turns their kettles on
710.007	at the same time.
712.072	(Laughter)
714.318	1.5 million kettles, seriously problematic.
720.303	So imagine if you designed kettles,
723.872	you actually found a way to
723.872	solve these system failures,
726.612	because this is a huge amount of pressure
729.277	on the system,
730.668	just because the product hasn't
730.668	thought about the problem
734.104	that it's going to have when it exists in the world.
735.967	Now, I looked at a number of
735.967	kettles available on the market,
738.635	and found the minimum fill lines,
740.657	so the little piece of information that tells you
742.423	how much you need to put in there,
743.98	was between two and a five-and-a-half cups of water
746.899	just to make one cup of tea.
750.332	So this kettle here is an example of one where
752.617	it actually has two reservoirs.
755.155	One's a boiling chamber, and one's the water holder.
757.34	The user actually has to push that button
759.665	to get their hot water boiled,
761.233	which means, because we're all lazy,
762.999	you only fill exactly what you need.
764.841	And this is what I call behavior-changing products:
767.165	products, systems or services
769.277	that intervene and solve these problems up front.
773.136	Now, this is a technology arena,
775.786	so obviously these things are quite popular,
777.847	but I think if we're going to keep
779.815	designing, buying and using and throwing out
782.401	these kinds of products at the rate we currently do,
784.313	which is astronomically high,
786.562	there are seven billion people
788.396	who live in the world right now.
789.806	There are six billion mobile phone subscriptions
791.993	as of last year.
795.659	Every single year, 1.5 billion mobile phones
799.181	roll off production lines,
800.434	and some companies report their production rate
802.505	as being greater than the human birth rate.
804.855	One hundred fifty-two million phones 
804.855	were thrown out in the U.S. last year;
807.985	only 11 percent were recycled.
809.869	I'm from Australia. We have a
809.869	population of 22 million -- don't laugh --
813.227	and it's been reported that 22 million phones
816.3	are in people's drawers.
818.907	We need to find ways of solving
818.907	the problems around this,
822.628	because these things are so complicated.
825.525	They have so much locked up inside them.
828.831	Gold! Did you know that it's actually cheaper now
832.594	to get gold out of a ton of old mobile phones
836.211	than it is out of a ton of gold ore?
839.439	There's a number of highly complex and valuable
841.829	materials embodied inside these things,
843.43	so we need to find ways of encouraging disassembly,
845.888	because this is otherwise what happens.
848.052	This is a community in Ghana,
849.726	and e-waste is reported, or electronic waste
851.984	is reported by the U.N.
853.96	as being up to 50 million tons trafficked.
856.992	This is how they get the gold
858.306	and the other valuable materials out.
859.84	They burn the electronic waste
861.778	in open spaces.
863.809	These are communities, and this
863.809	is happening all over the world.
866.944	And because we don't see the ramifications
869.491	of the choices that we make as designers,
871.32	as businesspeople, as consumers,
873.79	then these kinds of externalities happen,
875.403	and these are people's lives.
877.705	So we need to find smarter, more systems-based,
882.153	innovative solutions to these problems,
885.069	if we're going to start to live
885.069	sustainably within this world.
888.845	So imagine if, when you bought your mobile phone,
892.818	your new one because you replaced your old one --
894.508	after 15 to 18 months is the average time
896.883	that people replace their phones, by the way —
898.987	so if we're going to keep this kind of expedient
901.972	mobile phone replacing, then we should
904.21	be looking at closing the loop on these systems.
906.259	The people who produce these phones,
908.17	and some of which I'm sure
908.17	are in the room right now,
909.999	could potentially look at doing what
909.999	we call closed-loop systems,
912.677	or product system services,
914.245	so identifying that there is a market demand
916.507	and that market demand's not going to go anywhere,
918.324	so you design the product to solve the problem.
921.377	Design for disassembly, design for light-weighting.
923.716	We heard some of those kinds of strategies
926.082	being used in the Tesla Motors car today.
928.941	These kinds of approaches are not hard,
931.053	but understanding the system
932.911	and then looking for viable, market-driven
936.442	consumer demand alternatives
938.425	is how we can start radically altering
940.976	the sustainability agenda,
942.783	because I hate to break it to you all:
944.654	Consumption is the biggest problem.
947.457	But design is one of the best solutions.
952.719	These kinds of products are everywhere.
954.903	By identifying alternative ways of doing things,
957.571	we can actually start to innovate,
959.166	and I say actually start to innovate.
960.559	I'm sure everyone in this room is very innovative.
963.044	But in the regards to using sustainability
965.398	as a parameter, as a criteria
968.085	for fueling systems-based solutions,
972.302	because as I've just demonstrated
972.302	with these simple products,
975.207	they're participating in these major problems.
978.598	So we need to look across the entire life
980.753	of the things that we do.
982.375	If you just had paper or plastic --
984.09	obviously reusable is far more beneficial --
986.854	then the paper is worse,
990.325	and the paper is worse because it weighs
992.371	four to 10 times more than the plastic,
994.475	and when we actually compare,
994.475	from a life cycle perspective,
996.842	a kilo of plastic and a kilo of paper,
999.532	the paper is far better,
1001.178	but the functionality of a plastic or a paper bag
1003.718	to carry your groceries home is not 
1003.718	done with a kilo of each material.
1007.333	It's done with a very small amount of plastic
1009.302	and quite a lot more paper.
1010.995	Because functionality defines environmental impact,
1013.953	and I said earlier that the designers
1013.953	always ask me for the eco-materials.
1016.786	I say, there's only a few materials
1016.786	that you should completely avoid.
1019.831	The rest of them, it's all about application,
1021.73	and at the end of the day, everything
1021.73	we design and produce in the economy
1024.749	or buy as consumers is done so for function.
1027.089	We want something, therefore we buy it.
1029.206	So breaking things back down and delivering
1032.362	smartly, elegantly, sophisticated solutions
1036.361	that take into consideration the entire system
1039.158	and the entire life of the thing, everything,
1042.253	all the way back to the extraction
1042.253	through to the end of life,
1045.089	we can start to actually find
1045.089	really innovative solutions.
1047.891	And I'll just leave you with one very quick thing
1049.961	that a designer said to me recently 
1049.961	who I work with, a senior designer.
1053.818	"I said, ""How come you're not doing "
1053.818	"sustainability? I know you know this."""
1056.916	"And he said, ""Well, recently I pitched"
1056.916	a sustainability project to a client,
1060.928	and turned and he said to me,
1062.869	'I know it's going to cost less,
1064.634	I know it's going to sell more,
1066.252	but we're not pioneers, because
1066.252	"pioneers have arrows in their backs.'"""
1070.725	I think we've got a roomful of pioneers,
1072.942	and I hope there are far more pioneers out there,
1072.942	because we need to solve these problems.
1076.027	Thank you.
1077.434	(Applause)
