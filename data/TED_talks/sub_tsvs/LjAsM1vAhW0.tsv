15.5	As the highest military commander
15.5	of the Netherlands,
20.66	with troops stationed around the world,
23.7	I'm really honored to be here today.
27.86	When I look around
27.86	this TEDxAmsterdam venue,
32.06	I see a very special audience.
36.22	You are the reason why I said yes
40.148	to the invitation to come here today.
44.78	When I look around, I see people
44.78	who want to make a contribution.
50.58	I see people who want
50.58	to make a better world,
55.3	by doing groundbreaking scientific work,
59.26	by creating impressive works of art,
62.86	by writing critical articles
62.86	or inspiring books,
68.1	by starting up sustainable businesses.
71.62	And you all have chosen
71.62	your own instruments
76.02	to fulfill this mission
76.02	of creating a better world.
80.74	Some chose the microscope
80.74	as their instrument.
84.86	Others chose dancing or painting,
88.171	or making music like we just heard.
91.1	Some chose the pen.
93.82	Others work through
93.82	the instrument of money.
98.3	Ladies and gentlemen,
98.3	I made a different choice.
116.1	Thanks.
120.94	Ladies and gentlemen ...
124.38	(Laughter)
126.38	(Applause)
132.291	I share your goals.
135.5	I share the goals
135.5	of the speakers you heard before.
140.78	I did not choose to take up the pen,
146.82	the brush,
148.86	the camera.
150.82	I chose this instrument.
154.7	I chose the gun.
158.3	For you, and you heard already,
160.78	being so close to this gun
160.78	may make you feel uneasy.
167.74	It may even feel scary.
170.3	A real gun at a few feet's distance.
174.74	Let us stop for a moment
174.74	and feel this uneasiness.
179.9	You could even hear it.
182.62	Let us cherish the fact
184.82	that probably most of you
184.82	have never been close to a gun.
191.06	It means the Netherlands
191.06	is a peaceful country.
195.94	The Netherlands is not at war.
199.38	It means soldiers are not needed
199.38	to patrol our streets.
204.86	Guns are not a part of our lives.
209.78	In many countries,
209.78	it is a different story.
214.7	In many countries,
214.7	people are confronted with guns.
219.22	They are oppressed.
221.1	They are intimidated --
223.5	by warlords,
225.86	by terrorists,
228.02	by criminals.
230.18	Weapons can do a lot of harm.
233.3	They are the cause of much distress.
236.34	Why then am I standing before you
236.34	with this weapon?
241.34	Why did I choose the gun as my instrument?
246.54	Today I want to tell you why.
249.42	Today I want to tell you
251.02	why I chose the gun
251.02	to create a better world.
254.94	And I want to tell you
254.94	how this gun can help.
261.42	My story starts in the city of Nijmegen
266.78	in the east of the Netherlands,
269.58	the city where I was born.
273.74	My father was a hardworking baker,
280.06	but when he had finished
280.06	work in the bakery,
282.94	he often told me and my brother stories.
286.9	And most of the time,
288.54	he told me this story
288.54	I'm going to share with you now.
293.58	The story of what happened
295.26	when he was a conscripted soldier
295.26	in the Dutch armed forces
299.62	at the beginning of the Second World War.
303.42	The Nazis invaded the Netherlands.
306.3	Their grim plans were evident.
309.1	They meant to rule by means of repression.
313.62	Diplomacy had failed to stop the Germans.
317.94	Only brute force remained.
321.62	It was our last resort.
324.86	My father was there to provide it.
329.3	As the son of a farmer
329.3	who knew how to hunt,
333.14	my father was an excellent marksman.
336.18	When he aimed, he never missed.
340.06	At this decisive moment in Dutch history
343.1	my father was positioned
343.1	on the bank of the river Waal
347.94	near the city of Nijmegen.
350.94	He had a clear shot at the German soldiers
350.94	who came to occupy a free country,
357.18	his country,
358.78	our country.
360.82	He fired. Nothing happened.
363.98	He fired again.
365.74	No German soldier fell to the ground.
369.42	My father had been given an old gun
374.26	that could not even reach
374.26	the opposite riverbank.
379.46	Hitler's troops marched on,
382.26	and there was nothing
382.26	my father could do about it.
386.66	Until the day my father died,
389.62	he was frustrated
389.62	about missing these shots.
394.34	He could have done something.
396.86	But with an old gun,
398.7	not even the best marksman
398.7	in the armed forces
401.62	could have hit the mark.
404.38	So this story stayed with me.
408.46	Then in high school,
409.86	I was gripped by the stories
409.86	of the Allied soldiers --
414.7	soldiers who left the safety
414.7	of their own homes and risked their lives
419.98	to liberate a country
423.1	and a people that they didn't know.
426.26	They liberated my birth town.
429.9	It was then that I decided
429.9	I would take up the gun --
435.78	out of respect and gratitude
435.78	for those men and women
440.46	who came to liberate us.
444.26	From the awareness
444.26	that sometimes only the gun
449.1	can stand between good and evil.
454.14	And that is why I took up the gun --
458.18	not to shoot,
460.1	not to kill,
461.58	not to destroy,
463.86	but to stop those who would do evil,
467.62	to protect the vulnerable,
470.54	to defend democratic values,
473.94	to stand up for the freedom we have
473.94	to talk here today in Amsterdam
480.42	about how we can
480.42	make the world a better place.
484.9	Ladies and gentlemen,
486.14	I do not stand here today
486.14	to tell you about the glory of weapons.
492.46	I do not like guns.
495.74	And once you have been
495.74	under fire yourself,
500.34	it brings home even more clearly
502.9	that a gun is not
502.9	some macho instrument to brag about.
508.86	I stand here today
510.38	to tell you about the use of the gun
510.38	as an instrument of peace and stability.
518.38	The gun may be one of the most important
518.38	instruments of peace and stability
522.74	that we have in this world.
525.26	Now this may sound contradictory to you.
529.66	But not only have I seen with my own eyes
533.419	during my deployments in Lebanon, Sarajevo
536.466	and as the Netherlands' Chief of Defence,
540.3	this is also supported
540.3	by cold, hard statistics.
547.22	Violence has declined dramatically
547.22	over the last 500 years.
553.3	Despite the pictures
553.3	we are shown daily in the news,
557.7	wars between developed countries
557.7	are no longer commonplace.
562.54	The murder rate in Europe
563.82	has dropped by a factor of 30
563.82	since the Middle Ages.
568.78	And occurrences
568.78	of civil war and repression
571.58	have declined since the end
571.58	of the Cold War.
575.46	Statistics show that we are living
575.46	in a relatively peaceful era.
581.74	Why?
583.3	Why has violence decreased?
586.54	Has the human mind changed?
588.54	Well, we were talking
588.54	about the human mind this morning.
591.7	Did we simply lose
591.7	our beastly impulses for revenge,
596.54	for violent rituals,
598.82	for pure rage?
601.62	Or is there something else?
604.9	In his latest book,
604.9	Harvard professor Steven Pinker --
608.54	and many other thinkers before him --
610.94	concludes that one of the main drivers
615.78	behind less violent societies
618.34	is the spread of the constitutional state
622.34	and the introduction, on a large scale,
625.548	of the state monopoly
625.548	on the legitimized use of violence --
630.7	legitimized by a democratically
630.7	elected government,
636.38	legitimized by checks and balances
636.38	and an independent judicial system.
642.9	In other words, a state monopoly
645.98	that has the use of violence
645.98	well under control.
651.66	Such a state monopoly on violence,
651.66	first of all, serves as a reassurance.
659.42	It removes the incentive for an arms race
662.26	between potentially hostile groups
662.26	in our societies.
666.78	Secondly, the presence of penalties
669.58	that outweigh the benefits
669.58	of using violence
673.26	tips the balance even further.
676.58	Abstaining from violence
678.42	becomes more profitable
678.42	than starting a war.
682.86	Now nonviolence starts to work
682.86	like a flywheel.
688.42	It enhances peace even further.
692.1	Where there is no conflict,
692.1	trade flourishes.
696.74	And trade is another important
696.74	incentive against violence.
701.78	With trade, there's mutual interdependency
701.78	and mutual gain between parties.
708.66	And when there is mutual gain,
708.66	both sides stand to lose more
713.74	than they would gain
713.74	if they started a war.
718.14	War is simply no longer the best option,
722.62	and that is why violence has decreased.
728.34	This, ladies and gentlemen,
730.14	is the rationale behind the existence
730.14	of my armed forces.
735.82	The armed forces implement
735.82	the state monopoly on violence.
740.9	We do this in a legitimized way
743.38	only after our democracy
743.38	has asked us to do so.
750.34	It is this legitimate,
750.34	controlled use of the gun
755.54	that has contributed greatly
757.38	to reducing the statistics of war,
757.38	conflict and violence around the globe.
763.78	It is this participation
763.78	in peacekeeping missions
767.34	that has led to the resolution
767.34	of many civil wars.
772.02	My soldiers use the gun
772.02	as an instrument of peace.
778.54	And this is exactly
778.54	why failed states are so dangerous.
783.9	Failed states have no legitimized,
783.9	democratically controlled use of force.
789.5	Failed states do not know of the gun
789.5	as an instrument of peace and stability.
796.86	That is why failed states can drag down
796.86	a whole region into chaos and conflict.
804.22	That is why spreading the concept
804.22	of the constitutional state
808.14	is such an important aspect
808.14	of our foreign missions.
812.78	That is why we are trying
812.78	to build a judicial system
816.54	right now in Afghanistan.
819.82	That is why we train
819.82	police officers, we train judges,
824.1	we train public prosecutors
824.1	around the world.
827.86	And that is why --
829.22	and in the Netherlands,
829.22	we are very unique in that --
832.54	that is why the Dutch constitution states
836.3	that one of the main tasks
836.3	of the armed forces
839.58	is to uphold and promote
839.58	the international rule of law.
846.38	Ladies and gentlemen,
847.98	looking at this gun, we are confronted
847.98	with the ugly side of the human mind.
855.9	Every day I hope that politicians,
855.9	diplomats, development workers
861.94	can turn conflict into peace
865.42	and threat
867.46	into hope.
869.3	And I hope that one day
869.3	armies can be disbanded
874.1	and humans will find a way
874.1	of living together
877.02	without violence and oppression.
880.46	But until that day comes,
884.14	we will have to make ideals
884.14	and human failure
889.54	meet somewhere in the middle.
892.18	Until that day comes,
892.18	I stand for my father
897.22	who tried to shoot the Nazis
897.22	with an old gun.
901.46	I stand for my men and women
901.46	who are prepared to risk their lives
907.54	for a less violent world for all of us.
912.26	I stand for this soldier
912.26	who suffered partial hearing loss
918.18	and sustained permanent
918.18	injuries to her leg,
921.34	when she was hit by a rocket
921.34	on a mission in Afghanistan.
927.86	Ladies and gentlemen,
929.66	until the day comes
929.66	when we can do away with the gun,
934.94	I hope we all agree
937.82	that peace and stability
937.82	do not come free of charge.
943.1	It takes hard work,
943.1	often behind the scenes.
948.9	It takes good equipment
948.9	and well-trained, dedicated soldiers.
954.54	I hope you will support
954.54	the efforts of our armed forces
959.5	to train soldiers like this young captain
962.54	and provide her with a good gun,
965.46	instead of the bad gun
965.46	my father was given.
969.06	I hope you will support our soldiers
969.06	when they are out there,
974.78	when they come home
977.26	and when they are injured
977.26	and need our care.
981.1	They put their lives on the line,
981.1	for us, for you,
985.94	and we cannot let them down.
989.9	I hope you will respect my soldiers,
994.26	this soldier with this gun.
997.18	Because she wants a better world.
1000.5	Because she makes an active
1000.5	contribution to a better world,
1005.34	just like all of us here today.
1009.14	Thank you very much.
1010.62	(Applause)
