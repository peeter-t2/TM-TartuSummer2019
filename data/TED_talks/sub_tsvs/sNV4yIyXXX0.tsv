15.895	I've been a journalist now since I was about 17,
18.516	and it's an interesting industry to be in at the moment,
22.076	because as you all know, there's a huge amount of upheaval
24.412	going on in media, and most of you probably know this
26.892	from the business angle, which is that the business model
30.115	is pretty screwed, and as my grandfather would say,
33.058	the profits have all been gobbled up by Google.
35.772	So it's a really interesting time to be a journalist,
38.116	but the upheaval that I'm interested in is not on the output side.
41.2	It's on the input side. It's concern with
44.295	how we get information and how we gather the news.
46.793	And that's changed, because we've had a huge shift
49.864	in the balance of power from
52.102	the news organizations to the audience.
54.119	And the audience for such a long time was in a position
56.334	where they didn't have any way of affecting news
59.024	or making any change. They couldn't really connect.
61.291	And that's changed irrevocably.
62.767	My first connection with the news media was
65.656	in 1984, the BBC had a one-day strike.
69.467	I wasn't happy. I was angry. I couldn't see my cartoons.
72.755	So I wrote a letter.
75.302	And it's a very effective way of ending your hate mail:
78.151	"""Love Markham, Aged 4."" Still works."
81.238	I'm not sure if I had any impact on the one-day strike,
84.249	but what I do know is that it took them three weeks to get back to me.
86.931	And that was the round journey. It took that long for anyone
89.091	to have any impact and get some feedback.
91.284	And that's changed now because, as journalists,
93.766	we interact in real time. We're not in a position
96.932	where the audience is reacting to news.
99.266	We're reacting to the audience, and we're actually relying on them.
103.023	They're helping us find the news. They're helping us
105.409	figure out what is the best angle to take and what is the stuff that they want to hear.
110.179	So it's a real-time thing. It's much quicker. It's happening
114.083	on a constant basis, and the journalist is always playing catch up.
120	To give an example of how we rely on the audience,
122.633	on the 5th of September in Costa Rica, an earthquake hit.
127.17	It was a 7.6 magnitude. It was fairly big.
129.496	And 60 seconds is the amount of time it took
132.376	for it to travel 250 kilometers to Managua.
134.941	So the ground shook in Managua 60 seconds after it hit the epicenter.
139.086	Thirty seconds later, the first message went onto Twitter,
141.742	"and this was someone saying ""temblor,"" which means earthquake."
144.603	So 60 seconds was how long it took
146.94	for the physical earthquake to travel.
148.846	Thirty seconds later news of that earthquake had traveled
151.406	all around the world, instantly. Everyone in the world,
154.38	hypothetically, had the potential to know that an earthquake
157.577	was happening in Managua.
159.991	And that happened because this one person had
162.342	a documentary instinct, which was to post a status update,
166.291	which is what we all do now, so if something happens,
168.823	we put our status update, or we post a photo,
170.905	we post a video, and it all goes up into the cloud in a constant stream.
174.683	And what that means is just constant,
177.444	huge volumes of data going up.
179.85	It's actually staggering. When you look at the numbers,
182.131	every minute there are 72 more hours
185.122	of video on YouTube.
186.504	So that's, every second, more than an hour of video gets uploaded.
189.786	And in photos, Instagram, 58 photos are uploaded to Instagram a second.
194.042	More than three and a half thousand photos go up onto Facebook.
197.798	So by the time I'm finished talking here, there'll be 864
201.506	more hours of video on Youtube than there were when I started,
205.124	and two and a half million more photos on Facebook and Instagram than when I started.
208.987	So it's an interesting position to be in as a journalist,
212.919	because we should have access to everything.
215.335	Any event that happens anywhere in the world, I should be able to know about it
218.233	pretty much instantaneously, as it happens, for free.
222.164	And that goes for every single person in this room.
225.329	The only problem is, when you have that much information,
227.939	you have to find the good stuff, and that can be
230.226	incredibly difficult when you're dealing with those volumes.
232.214	And nowhere was this brought home more than during
234.533	Hurricane Sandy. So what you had in Hurricane Sandy was
237.437	a superstorm, the likes of which we hadn't seen for a long time,
240.464	hitting the iPhone capital of the universe -- (Laughter) --
243.607	and you got volumes of media like we'd never seen before.
247.822	And that meant that journalists had to deal with fakes,
250.566	so we had to deal with old photos that were being reposted.
253.482	We had to deal with composite images
255.73	that were merging photos from previous storms.
258.913	"We had to deal with images from films like ""The Day After Tomorrow."" (Laughter)"
264.147	And we had to deal with images that were so realistic
266.981	it was nearly difficult to tell if they were real at all.
269.351	(Laughter)
273.664	But joking aside, there were images like this one from Instagram
277.388	which was subjected to a grilling by journalists.
279.664	They weren't really sure. It was filtered in Instagram.
281.897	The lighting was questioned. Everything was questioned about it.
284.42	And it turned out to be true. It was from Avenue C
286.713	in downtown Manhattan, which was flooded.
288.873	And the reason that they could tell that it was real
290.973	was because they could get to the source, and in this case,
293.062	these guys were New York food bloggers.
295.169	They were well respected. They were known.
297.199	So this one wasn't a debunk, it was actually something that they could prove.
300.291	And that was the job of the journalist. It was filtering all this stuff.
303.209	And you were, instead of going and finding the information
305.92	and bringing it back to the reader, you were holding back
308.487	the stuff that was potentially damaging.
310.547	And finding the source becomes more and more important --
313.505	finding the good source -- and Twitter is where most journalists now go.
317.239	It's like the de facto real-time newswire,
320.392	if you know how to use it, because there is so much on Twitter.
323.359	And a good example of how useful it can be
325.744	but also how difficult was the Egyptian revolution in 2011.
329.277	As a non-Arabic speaker, as someone who was looking
331.923	from the outside, from Dublin,
334.224	Twitter lists, and lists of good sources,
336.016	people we could establish were credible, were really important.
339.638	And how do you build a list like that from scratch?
342.147	Well, it can be quite difficult, but you have to know what to look for.
344.577	This visualization was done by an Italian academic.
347.435	He's called Andr√© Pannison, and he basically
350.829	took the Twitter conversation in Tahrir Square
353.004	on the day that Hosni Mubarak would eventually resign,
356.458	and the dots you can see are retweets, so when someone
359.09	retweets a message, a connection is made between two dots,
361.869	and the more times that message is retweeted by other people,
364.479	the more you get to see these nodes, these connections being made.
367.685	And it's an amazing way of visualizing the conversation,
369.607	but what you get is hints at who is more interesting
372.318	and who is worth investigating.
374.999	And as the conversation grew and grew, it became
377.878	more and more lively, and eventually you were left
380.162	with this huge, big, rhythmic pointer of this conversation.
384.943	You could find the nodes, though, and then you went,
386.752	"and you go, ""Right, I've got to investigate these people."
389.046	These are the ones that are obviously making sense.
390.76	"Let's see who they are."""
393.069	Now in the deluge of information, this is where
395.759	the real-time web gets really interesting for a journalist like myself,
398.966	because we have more tools than ever
400.94	to do that kind of investigation.
403.697	And when you start digging into the sources, you can go
406.706	further and further than you ever could before.
409.005	Sometimes you come across a piece of content that
412.357	is so compelling, you want to use it, you're dying to use it,
415.817	but you're not 100 percent sure if you can because
418.492	you don't know if the source is credible.
419.699	You don't know if it's a scrape. You don't know if it's a re-upload.
421.881	And you have to do that investigative work.
423.59	And this video, which I'm going to let run through,
425.934	was one we discovered a couple of weeks ago.
428.923	Video: Getting real windy in just a second.
431.122	(Rain and wind sounds)
436.01	(Explosion) Oh, shit!
439.177	Markham Nolan: Okay, so now if you're a news producer, this is something
442.114	you'd love to run with, because obviously, this is gold.
444.666	You know? This is a fantastic reaction from someone,
446.929	very genuine video that they've shot in their back garden.
449.499	But how do you find if this person, if it's true, if it's faked,
452.993	or if it's something that's old and that's been reposted?
455.651	So we set about going to work on this video, and
457.877	the only thing that we had to go on was the username on the YouTube account.
460.737	There was only one video posted to that account,
463.088	and the username was Rita Krill.
464.576	And we didn't know if Rita existed or if it was a fake name.
467.868	But we started looking, and we used free Internet tools to do so.
470.781	The first one was called Spokeo, which allowed us to look for Rita Krills.
474.089	So we looked all over the U.S. We found them in New York,
476.471	we found them in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Florida.
479.233	So we went and we looked for a second free Internet tool
481.882	called Wolfram Alpha, and we checked the weather reports
484.349	for the day in which this video had been uploaded,
486.846	and when we went through all those various cities,
488.729	we found that in Florida, there were thunderstorms and rain on the day.
492.225	So we went to the white pages, and we found,
494.87	we looked through the Rita Krills in the phonebook,
497.794	and we looked through a couple of different addresses,
499.366	and that took us to Google Maps, where we found a house.
502.682	And we found a house with a swimming pool that looked
504.597	remarkably like Rita's. So we went back to the video,
507.515	and we had to look for clues that we could cross-reference.
510.486	So if you look in the video, there's the big umbrella,
513.701	there's a white lilo in the pool,
515.546	there are some unusually rounded edges in the swimming pool,
517.986	and there's two trees in the background.
520.04	And we went back to Google Maps, and we looked a little bit closer,
522.467	and sure enough, there's the white lilo,
525.138	there are the two trees,
528.132	there's the umbrella. It's actually folded in this photo.
530.118	Little bit of trickery. And there are the rounded edges on the swimming pool.
533.896	So we were able to call Rita, clear the video,
537.046	make sure that it had been shot, and then our clients
539.132	were delighted because they were able to run it without being worried.
542.326	Sometimes the search for truth, though,
544.101	is a little bit less flippant, and it has much greater consequences.
548.51	Syria has been really interesting for us, because obviously
551.493	a lot of the time you're trying to debunk stuff that can be
554.174	potentially war crime evidence, so this is where YouTube
557.973	actually becomes the most important repository
560.33	of information about what's going on in the world.
564.48	So this video, I'm not going to show you the whole thing,
567.234	because it's quite gruesome, but you'll hear some of the sounds.
569.955	This is from Hama.
572.283	Video: (Shouting)
575.253	And what this video shows, when you watch the whole thing through,
579.157	is bloody bodies being taken out of a pickup truck
581.918	and thrown off a bridge.
584.523	The allegations were that these guys were Muslim Brotherhood
587.304	and they were throwing Syrian Army officers' bodies
590.179	off the bridge, and they were cursing and using blasphemous language,
593.113	and there were lots of counterclaims about who they were,
595.495	and whether or not they were what the video said it was.
597.737	So we talked to some sources in Hama who we had been
601.003	back and forth with on Twitter, and we asked them about this,
603.336	and the bridge was interesting to us because it was something we could identify.
607.15	Three different sources said three different things about the bridge.
610.064	They said, one, the bridge doesn't exist.
612.326	Another one said the bridge does exist, but it's not in Hama. It's somewhere else.
615.85	"And the third one said, ""I think the bridge does exist,"
618.412	but the dam upstream of the bridge was closed,
621.776	"so the river should actually have been dry, so this doesn't make sense."""
625.173	So that was the only one that gave us a clue.
627.785	We looked through the video for other clues.
629.01	We saw the distinctive railings, which we could use.
632.099	We looked at the curbs. The curbs were throwing shadows south,
635.843	so we could tell the bridge was running east-west across the river.
638.16	It had black-and-white curbs.
640.116	As we looked at the river itself, you could see there's
642.102	a concrete stone on the west side. There's a cloud of blood.
645.056	That's blood in the river. So the river is flowing
646.79	south to north. That's what that tells me.
648.487	And also, as you look away from the bridge,
650.836	there's a divot on the left-hand side of the bank,
652.485	and the river narrows.
654.915	So onto Google Maps we go, and we start
657.494	looking through literally every single bridge.
659.552	We go to the dam that we talked about, we start just
663.032	literally going through every time that road crosses the river,
666.642	crossing off the bridges that don't match.
668.38	We're looking for one that crosses east-west.
670.143	And we get to Hama. We get all the way from the dam
672.095	to Hama and there's no bridge.
674.098	So we go a bit further. We switch to the satellite view,
676.582	and we find another bridge, and everything starts to line up.
679.502	The bridge looks like it's crossing the river east to west.
682.54	So this could be our bridge. And we zoom right in.
685.701	We start to see that it's got a median, so it's a two-lane bridge.
688.603	And it's got the black-and-white curbs that we saw in the video,
692.249	and as we click through it, you can see someone's
694.561	uploaded photos to go with the map, which is very handy,
697.515	so we click into the photos. And the photos start showing us
700.202	more detail that we can cross-reference with the video.
702.824	The first thing that we see is we see black-and-white curbing,
706.547	which is handy because we've seen that before.
708.652	We see the distinctive railing that we saw the guys
712.151	throwing the bodies over.
714.502	And we keep going through it until we're certain that this is our bridge.
717.157	So what does that tell me? I've got to go back now
718.681	to my three sources and look at what they told me:
720.994	the one who said the bridge didn't exist,
722.719	the one who said the bridge wasn't in Hama,
724.578	"and the one guy who said, ""Yes, the bridge does exist, but I'm not sure about the water levels."""
728.531	Number three is looking like the most truthful all of a sudden,
731.862	and we've been able to find that out using some free Internet tools
734.843	sitting in a cubicle in an office in Dublin
737.363	in the space of 20 minutes.
738.85	And that's part of the joy of this. Although the web
741.289	is running like a torrent, there's so much information there
744.554	that it's incredibly hard to sift and getting harder every day,
747.741	if you use them intelligently, you can find out incredible information.
751.068	Given a couple of clues, I could probably find out
753.463	a lot of things about most of you in the audience that you might not like me finding out.
756.997	But what it tells me is that, at a time when
760.002	there's more -- there's a greater abundance of information than there ever has been,
764.031	it's harder to filter, we have greater tools.
766.664	We have free Internet tools that allow us,
768.527	help us do this kind of investigation.
770.753	We have algorithms that are smarter than ever before,
772.576	and computers that are quicker than ever before.
774.997	But here's the thing. Algorithms are rules. They're binary.
778.424	They're yes or no, they're black or white.
780.209	Truth is never binary. Truth is a value.
783.763	Truth is emotional, it's fluid, and above all, it's human.
788.427	No matter how quick we get with computers, no matter
790.534	how much information we have, you'll never be able
792.918	to remove the human from the truth-seeking exercise,
795.914	because in the end, it is a uniquely human trait.
799.572	Thanks very much. (Applause)
