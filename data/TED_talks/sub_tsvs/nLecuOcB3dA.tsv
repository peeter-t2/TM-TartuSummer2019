12.788	My dream is to build the world's first
14.97	underground park in New York City.
17.294	Now, why would someone want
17.294	to build an underground park,
19.841	and why in New York City?
23.038	These three tough little buggers
24.562	are, on the left, my grandmother, age five,
27.778	and then her sister and brother,
29.128	ages 11 and nine.
30.666	This photo was taken just before they left
32.863	from Italy to immigrate to the United States,
35.471	just about a century ago.
37.982	And like many immigrants at the time,
39.377	they arrived on the Lower East Side
41.09	in New York City
42.291	and they encountered a crazy melting pot.
45.16	What was amazing about their generation
46.567	was that they were not only building new lives
49.627	in this new, unfamiliar area,
51.75	but they were also literally building the city.
54.346	I've always been fascinated by those decades
56.479	and by that history,
57.799	and I would often beg my grandmother
60.278	to tell me as many stories as possible
61.947	about the old New York.
63.955	But she would often just shrug it off,
66.133	tell me to eat more meatballs, more pasta,
68.383	and so I very rarely got
70.26	any of the history that I wanted to hear about.
73.355	The New York City that I encountered
74.616	felt pretty built up.
76.514	I always knew as a kid that I wanted
78.711	to make a difference, and to somehow
80.229	make the world more beautiful, more interesting
82.435	and more just.
83.462	I just didn't really know how.
85.259	At first, I thought I wanted to go work abroad,
86.947	so I took a job with UNICEF in Kenya.
89.366	But it felt weird to me that I knew more about
91.481	local Kenyan politics than the
91.481	politics of my own hometown.
95.115	I took a job with the City of New York,
97.121	but very quickly felt frustrated
99.27	with the slowness of government bureaucracy.
102.308	I even took a job at Google,
104.013	where very fast I drank the Kool-Aid
107.11	and believed almost wholeheartedly
108.856	that technology could solve all social problems.
112.474	But I still didn't feel like I was
112.474	making the world a better place.
115.96	It was in 2009 that my friend
117.819	and now business partner James Ramsey
119.787	alerted me to the location of a pretty spectacular site,
122.881	which is this.
124.331	This is the former trolley terminal
126.166	that was the depot for passengers
128.744	traveling over the Williamsburg Bridge
130.648	from Brooklyn to Manhattan,
132.932	and it was open between 1908 and 1948,
135.701	just around the time when my grandparents were
138.143	living right in the area.
139.992	And we learned also that the site
141.64	was entirely abandoned in 1948.
144.882	Fascinated by this discovery,
146.805	we begged the authorities to draw us into the space,
149.933	and we finally got a tour,
151.44	and this is what we saw.
153.59	Now, this photo doesn't really do it justice.
155.3	It's kind of hard to imagine the unbelievably magical
157.96	feeling that you have when you get in this space.
160.119	It's a football field of unused land
163.807	immediately below a very crowded area of the city,
167.21	and it almost feels like you're Indiana Jones
169.345	on an archaeological dig,
171.06	and all the details are all still there.
172.833	It's really pretty remarkable.
174.801	Now, the site itself is located at the very heart
177.401	of the Lower East Side,
179.27	and today it still remains one of the most
180.766	crowded neighborhoods in the city.
182.757	New York City has two thirds the green space
184.557	per resident as other big cities,
186.605	and this neighborhood as one tenth the green space.
189.778	So we immediately started thinking about how we
191.601	could take this site and turn it into something
193.671	that could be used for the public,
195.058	but also could potentially even be green.
197.81	Our plan, in a nutshell,
199.14	is to draw natural sunlight underground
201.841	using a simple system that
201.841	harvests sunlight above the street,
204.944	directs it below the city sidewalks,
207.38	and would allow plants and trees to grow
209.31	with the light that's directed underneath.
211.999	With this approach, you could take a site
213.73	that looks like this today
215.941	and transform it into something
217.707	that looks like this.
219.673	In 2011, we first released some of these images,
223.704	and what was funny was,
225.093	"a lot of people said to us, ""Oh, it kind of looks"
227.417	"like the High Line underground."""
229.353	And so what our nickname ended up becoming,
233.673	and what ended up sticking,
235.473	was the Lowline, so the Lowline was born.
238.319	What was also clear was that people really wanted
239.996	to know a lot more about how the technology
241.694	would look and feel,
243.26	and that there was really much more interest in this
245.393	than we had ever thought possible.
247.488	So, like a crazy person, I decided to quit my job
249.727	and focus entirely on this project.
251.921	Here is us with our team
253.743	putting together a technology demonstration
256.151	in a warehouse.
258.17	Here's the underbelly of this solar canopy
261.27	which we built to show the technology.
263.599	You can see the six solar collectors at the center there.
266.479	And here's the full exhibit all put together
269.09	in this warehouse.
270.541	You can see the solar canopy overhead,
272.318	the light streaming in,
273.734	and this entirely live green space below.
276.358	So in the course of just a few weeks,
277.784	tens of thousands of people came to see our exhibit,
281.353	and since that time, we've grown
282.81	our numbers of supporters both locally
285.111	and among design enthusiasts all over the world.
287.823	Here's a rendering of the neighborhood
289.884	just immediately above the Line's site,
292.25	and a rendering of how it will look
294.384	after major redevelopment that is coming
296.668	over the course of the next 10 years.
298.671	Notice how crowded the neighborhood still feels
300.786	and how there's really a lack of green space.
302.71	So what we're proposing is really something that will
305.43	add one football field of green space
309.18	underneath this neighborhood, but more importantly
312.046	will introduce a really community-driven focus
314.76	in a rapidly gentrifying area.
316.943	And right now, we're focusing very closely
318.687	on how we engage with the City of New York
321.106	on really transforming the overall ecosystem
324.549	in an integrated way.
326.63	Here's our rendering of how we would actually
328.239	invite people into the space itself.
330.377	So here you see this iconic entrance
332.683	in which we would literally peel up the street
334.855	and reveal the historical layers of the city,
337.87	and invite people into this warm underground space.
340.775	In the middle of winter, when it's
340.775	absolutely freezing outside,
343.034	the last place you'd want to go would be
344.124	an outdoor space or outdoor park.
346.634	The Lowline would really be a four-season space
348.559	and a respite for the city.
351.045	So I like to think that the Lowline actually brings
353.363	my own family's story full circle.
355.984	If my grandparents and my parents were really
357.918	focused on building the city up and out,
361.205	I think my generation is focused on reclaiming
363.281	the spaces that we already have,
365.189	rediscovering our shared history,
367.146	and reimagining how we can make our communities
369.724	more interesting, more beautiful and more just.
372.737	Thanks.
374.706	(Applause)
