15.508	I have to say that I'm very glad to be here.
17.911	I understand we have over 80 countries here,
21.112	so that's a whole new paradigm for me to speak
23.326	to all of these countries.
24.705	In each country, I'm sure you have this thing called
26.69	the parent-teacher conference.
28.811	Do you know about the parent-teacher conference?
30.925	Not the ones for your kids, but the one you had as a child,
33.325	where your parents come to school and your teacher
36.143	talks to your parents, and it's a little bit awkward.
38.641	Well, I remember in third grade, I had this moment
41.982	where my father, who never takes off from work,
44.838	he's a classical blue collar, a working-class immigrant person,
48.768	going to school to see his son, how he's doing,
51.928	"and the teacher said to him, he said, ""You know,"
54.435	"John is good at math and art."""
56.71	And he kind of nodded, you know?
58.772	The next day I saw him talking to a customer at our
61.142	"tofu store, and he said, ""You know, John's good at math."""
64.937	(Laughter)
68.228	And that always stuck with me all my life.
70.659	Why didn't Dad say art? Why wasn't it okay?
73.516	Why? It became a question my entire life, and
76.922	that's all right, because being good at math meant
79.839	he bought me a computer, and some of you remember
83.371	this computer, this was my first computer.
85.22	Who had an Apple II? Apple II users, very cool. (Applause)
89.073	As you remember, the Apple II did nothing at all. (Laughter)
92.327	You'd plug it in, you'd type in it and green text would come out.
94.588	It would say you're wrong most of the time.
96.145	That was the computer we knew.
97.979	That computer is a computer that I learned about
100.62	going to MIT, my father's dream. And at MIT, however,
105.197	I learned about the computer at all levels,
108.443	and after, I went to art school to get away from computers,
112.123	and I began to think about the computer as more of
114.361	a spiritual space of thinking.
116.542	And I was influenced by performance art --
119.396	so this is 20 years ago. I made a computer out of people.
123.631	It was called the Human Powered Computer Experiment.
126.669	I have a power manager, mouse driver, memory, etc.,
130.348	and I built this in Kyoto, the old capital of Japan.
134.135	It's a room broken in two halves.
136.1	I've turned the computer on,
138.2	and these assistants are placing a giant floppy disk
141.753	built out of cardboard, and it's put into the computer.
144.599	And the floppy disk drive person wears it. (Laughter)
148.908	She finds the first sector on the disk, and
151.425	takes data off the disk and passes it off to, of course, the bus.
156.756	So the bus diligently carries the data into the computer
160.312	to the memory, to the CPU, the VRAM, etc.,
163.756	and it's an actual working computer. That's a bus, really. (Laughter)
168.537	And it looks kind of fast. That's a mouse driver,
171.014	where it's XY. (Laughter)
173.013	It looks like it's happening kind of quickly, but it's actually
174.722	a very slow computer, and when I realized how slow
177.918	this computer was compared to how fast a computer is,
182.041	it made me wonder about computers and technology in general.
186.678	And so I'm going to talk today about four things, really.
188.803	The first three things are about how I've been curious
192.495	about technology, design and art, and how they intersect,
196.029	how they overlap, and also a topic that I've taken on
198.986	since four years ago I became the President
201.247	of Rhode Island School of Design: leadership.
204.82	And I'll talk about how I've looked to combine
207.537	these four areas into a kind of a synthesis, a kind of experiment.
212.172	So starting from technology,
214.807	technology is a wonderful thing.
217.142	When that Apple II came out, it really could do nothing.
220.666	It could show text and
223.136	after we waited a bit, we had these things called images.
226.734	Remember when images were first possible with a computer,
229.216	those gorgeous, full-color images?
231.612	And then after a few years, we got CD-quality sound.
234.83	It was incredible. You could listen to sound on the computer.
237.182	And then movies, via CD-ROM. It was amazing.
241.119	Remember that excitement?
243.262	And then the browser appeared. The browser was great,
246.959	but the browser was very primitive, very narrow bandwidth.
249.816	Text first, then images, we waited,
253.073	CD-quality sound over the Net,
254.869	then movies over the Internet. Kind of incredible.
259.513	And then the mobile phone occurred,
262.383	text, images, audio, video. And now we have iPhone,
267.918	iPad, Android, with text, video, audio, etc.
272.042	You see this little pattern here?
274.069	We're kind of stuck in a loop, perhaps, and this sense
277.402	of possibility from computing is something I've been
280.008	questioning for the last 10 or so years,
282.825	and have looked to design, as we understand most things,
287.039	and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine.
290.927	And I have a small experiment to give you a quick design lesson.
295.683	Designers talk about the relationship between form
298.181	and content, content and form. Now what does that mean?
301.522	Well, content is the word up there: fear.
304.089	It's a four-letter word. It's a kind of a bad feeling word, fear.
309.16	Fear is set in Light Helvetica, so it's not too stressful,
313.817	and if you set it in Ultra Light Helvetica,
316.518	"it's like, ""Oh, fear, who cares?"" Right? (Laughter)"
320.456	You take the same Ultra Light Helvetica and make it big,
323.054	and like, whoa, that hurts. Fear.
325.596	So you can see how you change the scale, you change
327.511	the form. Content is the same, but you feel differently.
331.819	You change the typeface to, like, this typeface,
333.886	and it's kind of funny. It's like pirate typeface,
336.669	like Captain Jack Sparrow typeface. Arr! Fear!
339.593	Like, aww, that's not fearful. That's actually funny.
342.484	Or fear like this, kind of a nightclub typeface. (Laughter)
346.353	Like, we gotta go to Fear. (Laughter)
348.773	It's, like, amazing, right? (Laughter) (Applause)
351.786	It just changes the same content.
354.238	Or you make it -- The letters are separated apart,
356.492	they're huddled together like on the deck of the Titanic,
358.68	and you feel sorry for the letters, like, I feel the fear.
361.679	You feel for them.
363.864	Or you change the typeface to something like this.
365.998	It's very classy. It's like that expensive restaurant, Fear.
369.53	I can never get in there. (Laughter)
371.816	It's just amazing, Fear. But that's form, content.
377.102	If you just change one letter in that content,
380.151	you get a much better word, much better content: free.
384.131	"""Free"" is a great word. You can serve it almost any way."
388.499	Free bold feels like Mandela free.
391.094	It's like, yes, I can be free.
393.775	Free even light feels kind of like, ah, I can breathe in free.
397.047	It feels great. Or even free spread out,
399.777	it's like, ah, I can breathe in free, so easily.
403.349	And I can add in a blue gradient and a dove,
406.556	and I have, like, Don Draper free. (Laughter)
408.907	So you see that -- form, content, design, it works that way.
412.269	It's a powerful thing. It's like magic, almost,
414.702	like the magicians we've seen at TED. It's magic.
418.988	Design does that.
421.275	And I've been curious about how design and technology intersect,
424.423	and I'm going to show you some old work I never really
425.892	show anymore, to give you a sense of what I used to do.
429.18	So -- yeah.
431.806	So I made a lot of work in the '90s.
434.997	This was a square that responds to sound.
438.293	People ask me why I made that. It's not clear. (Laughter)
441.719	But I thought it'd be neat for the square
447.435	to respond to me, and my kids were small then,
452.491	"and my kids would play with these things, like, ""Aaah,"""
455.067	"you know, they would say, ""Daddy, aaah, aaah."" You know, like that."
457.993	We'd go to a computer store, and they'd do the same thing.
460.378	"And they'd say, ""Daddy, why doesn't the computer respond to sound?"""
463.55	And it was really at the time I was wondering why doesn't the computer respond to sound?
467.093	So I made this as a kind of an experiment at the time.
470.312	And then I spent a lot of time in the space of
473.496	interactive graphics and things like this, and I stopped doing it because
476.465	my students at MIT got so much better than myself,
479.177	so I had to hang up my mouse.
480.987	But in '96, I made my last piece. It was in black and white,
484.555	monochrome, fully monochrome, all in integer mathematics.
487.782	"It's called ""Tap, Type, Write."""
489.448	It's paying a tribute to the wonderful typewriter
492.934	that my mother used to type on all the time as a legal secretary.
497.019	It has 10 variations. (Typing noise)
499.54	(Typing noise)
501.669	There's a shift.
505.042	Ten variations. This is, like, spin the letter around.
509.307	(Typing noises)
512.911	This is, like, a ring of letters. (Typing noises)
519.896	This is 20 years old, so it's kind of a --
522.807	Let's see, this is â€”
524.621	"I love the French film ""The Red Balloon."""
526.737	Great movie, right? I love that movie. So,
528.995	this is sort of like a play on that. (Typing noises) (Typewriter bell)
532.603	It's peaceful, like that. (Laughter)
536.733	I'll show this last one. This is about balance, you know.
540.9	It's kind of stressful typing out, so if you
542.851	type on this keyboard, you can, like, balance it out.
546.212	(Laughter)
548.282	If you hit G, life's okay, so I always say,
550.83	"""Hit G, and it's going to be all right."
554.187	Thank you. (Applause)
556.698	Thank you.
559.345	So that was 20 years ago, and
562.677	I was always on the periphery of art.
567.319	By being President of RISD I've gone deep into art,
569.669	and art is a wonderful thing, fine art, pure art.
573.328	"You know, when people say, ""I don't get art."
576.132	"I don't get it at all."" That means art is working, you know?"
580.52	It's like, art is supposed to be enigmatic, so when you say,
582.596	"like, ""I don't get it,"" like, oh, that's great. (Laughter)"
585.56	Art does that, because art is about asking questions,
588.192	questions that may not be answerable.
590.904	At RISD, we have this amazing facility called
592.832	the Edna Lawrence Nature Lab. It has 80,000 samples
596.502	of animal, bone, mineral, plants.
600.083	You know, in Rhode Island, if an animal gets hit on the road,
602.793	they call us up and we pick it up and stuff it.
605.967	And why do we have this facility?
608.508	Because at RISD, you have to look at the actual animal,
611.951	the object, to understand its volume, to perceive it.
614.831	At RISD, you're not allowed to draw from an image.
617.543	And many people ask me, John, couldn't you just
619.208	digitize all this? Make it all digital? Wouldn't it be better?
623.336	And I often say, well, there's something good to how things
626.278	used to be done. There's something very different about it,
629.943	something we should figure out what is good about
632.269	how we did it, even in this new era.
635.346	And I have a good friend, he's a new media artist named
638.237	Tota Hasegawa. He's based in London, no, actually it's in Tokyo,
641.775	but when he was based in London, he had a game
643.877	with his wife. He would go to antique shops,
647.168	and the game was as such:
649.315	When we look at an antique we want,
651.996	we'll ask the shopkeeper for the story behind the antique,
654.843	and if it's a good story, we'll buy it.
656.473	So they'd go to an antique shop, and they'd look at this cup,
658.714	"and they'd say, ""Tell us about this cup."""
660.043	"And the shopkeeper would say, ""It's old."" (Laughter)"
664.147	"""Tell us more."""
664.147	"""Oh, it's really old."" (Laughter)"
667.871	And he saw, over and over, the antique's value
670.417	was all about it being old.
673.08	And as a new media artist, he reflected, and said,
675.589	you know, I've spent my whole career making new media art.
678.233	"People say, ""Wow, your art, what is it?"""
678.233	It's new media.
682.935	And he realized, it isn't about old or new.
685.973	It's about something in between.
687.487	"It isn't about ""old,"" the dirt, ""new,"" the cloud. It's about what is good."
692.948	A combination of the cloud and the dirt is where the action is at.
698.382	You see it in all interesting art today, in all
700.366	interesting businesses today. How we combine
702.385	those two together to make good is very interesting.
706.674	So art makes questions, and
709.445	leadership is something that is asking a lot of questions.
714.268	We aren't functioning so easily anymore.
716.27	We aren't a simple authoritarian regime anymore.
719.398	As an example of authoritarianism, I was in Russia one time
722.804	traveling in St. Petersburg, at a national monument,
724.98	"and I saw this sign that says, ""Do Not Walk On The Grass,"""
728.142	and I thought, oh, I mean, I speak English,
729.785	and you're trying to single me out. That's not fair.
732.522	But I found a sign for Russian-speaking people,
735.396	and it was the best sign ever to say no.
738.569	"It was like, ""No swimming, no hiking, no anything."""
741.293	"My favorite ones are ""no plants."" Why would you bring a plant to a national monument? I'm not sure."
746.892	"And also ""no love."" (Laughter)"
749.165	So that is authoritarianism.
752.718	And what is that, structurally?
754.883	It's a hierarchy. We all know that a hierarchy is how we run
757.633	many systems today, but as we know, it's been disrupted.
760.658	It is now a network instead of a perfect tree.
764.176	It's a heterarchy instead of a hierarchy. And that's kind of awkward.
767.396	And so today, leaders are faced
770.796	with how to lead differently, I believe.
772.71	This is work I did with my colleague Becky Bermont
774.94	on creative leadership. What can we learn
777.18	from artists and designers for how to lead?
779.605	Because in many senses, a regular leader loves to avoid mistakes.
783.61	Someone who's creative actually loves to learn from mistakes.
787.683	A traditional leader is always wanting to be right,
790.861	whereas a creative leader hopes to be right.
795.322	And this frame is important today, in this complex,
797.82	ambiguous space, and artists and designers have a lot to teach us, I believe.
802.59	And I had a show in London recently where my friends
806.3	invited me to come to London for four days
808.177	to sit in a sandbox, and I said great.
810.639	And so I sat in a sandbox for four days straight,
813.987	six hours every day, six-minute appointments with anyone in London,
817.148	and that was really bad.
819.335	But I would listen to people, hear their issues,
822.967	draw in the sand, try to figure things out,
824.861	and it was kind of hard to figure out what I was doing.
827.404	You know? It's all these one-on-one meetings for like four days.
830.112	And it felt kind of like being president, actually.
832.018	"I was like, ""Oh, this my job. President. I do a lot of meetings, you know?"""
835.015	And by the end of the experience,
836.923	I realized why I was doing this.
839.762	It's because leaders, what we do is we connect
843.891	improbable connections and hope something will happen,
848.048	and in that room I found so many connections
849.803	between people across all of London, and so leadership,
854.123	connecting people, is the great question today.
856.76	Whether you're in the hierarchy or the heterarchy,
859.017	it's a wonderful design challenge.
861.412	And one thing I've been doing is doing some research
865.137	on systems that can combine technology and leadership
868.785	with an art and design perspective.
869.779	Let me show you something I haven't shown anywhere, actually.
874.052	So what this is, is a kind of a sketch, an application sketch
876.494	I wrote in Python. You know how there's Photoshop?
879.052	This is called Powershop, and the way it works is
883.311	imagine an organization. You know, the CEO isn't ever
886.338	at the top. The CEO's at the center of the organization.
888.62	There may be different subdivisions in the organization,
890.839	and you might want to look into different areas. For instance,
893.524	green are areas doing well, red are areas doing poorly.
897.026	You know, how do you, as the leader, scan, connect,
899.276	make things happen? So for instance, you might open up
902.28	a distribution here and find the different subdivisions in there,
905.43	and know that you know someone in Eco, over here,
909.141	and
911.122	these people here are in Eco, the people you might
913.13	engage with as CEO, people going across the hierarchy.
917.198	And part of the challenge of the CEO is to find
920.283	connections across areas, and so you might look in R&amp;D,
923.742	and here you see one person who crosses the two areas
926.942	of interest, and it's a person important to engage.
930.499	So you might want to, for instance, get a heads-up display
934.535	on how you're interacting with them.
937.134	How many coffees do you have?
938.713	How often are you calling them, emailing them?
942.107	What is the tenor of their email? How is it working out?
944.897	Leaders might be able to use these systems to
947.259	better regulate how they work inside the heterarchy.
950.241	You can also imagine using technology like from Luminoso,
953.668	the guys from Cambridge who were looking at deep
956.193	text analysis. What is the tenor of your communications?
959.422	So these kind of systems, I believe, are important.
962.875	They're targeted social media systems around leaders.
965.733	And I believe that this kind of perspective will only begin
969.042	to grow as more leaders enter the space of art and design,
974.349	because art and design lets you think like this,
977.774	find different systems like this,
979.549	and I've just begun thinking like this,
981.422	so I'm glad to share that with you.
983.355	So in closing, I want to thank all of you
986.537	for your attention. Thanks very much. (Applause)
990.619	(Applause)
