25.012	The phenomenon you saw here for a brief moment
29.33	is called quantum levitation and quantum locking.
35.719	And the object that was levitating here
39.608	is called a superconductor.
41.609	Superconductivity is a quantum state of matter,
47.201	and it occurs only below a certain critical temperature.
51.458	Now, it's quite an old phenomenon;
53.804	it was discovered 100 years ago.
55.57	However, only recently,
57.696	due to several technological advancements,
60.058	we are now able to demonstrate to you
62.73	quantum levitation and quantum locking.
66.476	So, a superconductor is defined by two properties.
72.321	The first is zero electrical resistance,
75.777	and the second is the expulsion of a magnetic field from the interior of the superconductor.
82.666	That sounds complicated, right?
85.561	But what is electrical resistance?
88.433	So, electricity is the flow of electrons inside a material.
94.682	And these electrons, while flowing,
98.031	they collide with the atoms, and in these collisions
100.719	they lose a certain amount of energy.
102.935	And they dissipate this energy in the form of heat, and you know that effect.
108.536	However, inside a superconductor there are no collisions,
114.455	so there is no energy dissipation.
119.147	It's quite remarkable. Think about it.
122.128	In classical physics, there is always some friction, some energy loss.
127.207	But not here, because it is a quantum effect.
131.276	But that's not all, because superconductors don't like magnetic fields.
139.962	So a superconductor will try to expel magnetic field from the inside,
144.279	and it has the means to do that by circulating currents.
150.402	Now, the combination of both effects --
153.392	the expulsion of magnetic fields and zero electrical resistance --
159.392	is exactly a superconductor.
162.56	But the picture isn't always perfect, as we all know,
166.776	and sometimes strands of magnetic field remain inside the superconductor.
174.161	Now, under proper conditions, which we have here,
177.815	these strands of magnetic field can be trapped inside the superconductor.
182.905	And these strands of magnetic field inside the superconductor,
189.162	they come in discrete quantities.
192.007	Why? Because it is a quantum phenomenon. It's quantum physics.
195.653	And it turns out that they behave like quantum particles.
199.503	In this movie here, you can see how they flow one by one discretely.
205.082	This is strands of magnetic field. These are not particles,
208.975	but they behave like particles.
213.27	So, this is why we call this effect quantum levitation and quantum locking.
217.464	But what happens to the superconductor when we put it inside a magnetic field?
223.527	Well, first there are strands of magnetic field left inside,
228.112	but now the superconductor doesn't like them moving around,
232.232	because their movements dissipate energy,
235.68	which breaks the superconductivity state.
238.626	So what it actually does, it locks these strands,
242.984	which are called fluxons, and it locks these fluxons in place.
248.736	And by doing that, what it actually does is locking itself in place.
255.024	Why? Because any movement of the superconductor will change their place,
264.24	will change their configuration.
266.047	So we get quantum locking. And let me show you how this works.
271.344	I have here a superconductor, which I wrapped up so it'd stay cold long enough.
277.104	And when I place it on top of a regular magnet,
281.568	it just stays locked in midair.
285.44	(Applause)
289.505	Now, this is not just levitation. It's not just repulsion.
293.551	I can rearrange the fluxons, and it will be locked in this new configuration.
298.672	Like this, or move it slightly to the right or to the left.
302.696	So, this is quantum locking -- actually locking -- three-dimensional locking of the superconductor.
310.447	Of course, I can turn it upside down,
312.607	and it will remain locked.
315.513	Now, now that we understand that this so-called levitation is actually locking,
324.735	Yeah, we understand that.
329.049	You won't be surprised to hear that if I take this circular magnet,
333.311	in which the magnetic field is the same all around,
337.279	the superconductor will be able to freely rotate around the axis of the magnet.
343.215	Why? Because as long as it rotates, the locking is maintained.
349.239	You see? I can adjust and I can rotate the superconductor.
355.265	We have frictionless motion. It is still levitating, but can move freely all around.
361.927	So, we have quantum locking and we can levitate it on top of this magnet.
371.207	But how many fluxons, how many magnetic strands are there in a single disk like this?
377.703	Well, we can calculate it, and it turns out, quite a lot.
380.584	One hundred billion strands of magnetic field inside this three-inch disk.
387.952	But that's not the amazing part yet, because there is something I haven't told you yet.
392.056	And, yeah, the amazing part is that this superconductor that you see here
397.672	is only half a micron thick. It's extremely thin.
405.197	And this extremely thin layer is able to levitate more than 70,000 times its own weight.
414.759	It's a remarkable effect. It's very strong.
420.592	Now, I can extend this circular magnet,
424.169	and make whatever track I want.
428.95	For example, I can make a large circular rail here.
432.879	And when I place the superconducting disk on top of this rail,
439.762	it moves freely.
443.871	(Applause)
453.252	And again, that's not all. I can adjust its position like this, and rotate,
457.993	and it freely moves in this new position.
464.434	And I can even try a new thing; let's try it for the first time.
468.872	I can take this disk and put it here,
474.816	and while it stays here -- don't move --
477.8	I will try to rotate the track,
484.358	and hopefully, if I did it correctly,
486.657	it stays suspended.
488.8	(Applause)
498.249	You see, it's quantum locking, not levitation.
505.09	Now, while I'll let it circulate for a little more,
509.225	let me tell you a little bit about superconductors.
512.928	Now -- (Laughter) --
518.474	So we now know that we are able to transfer enormous amount of currents inside superconductors,
525.497	so we can use them to produce strong magnetic fields,
530.72	such as needed in MRI machines, particle accelerators and so on.
535.906	But we can also store energy using superconductors,
540.466	because we have no dissipation.
542.355	And we could also produce power cables, to transfer enormous amounts of current between power stations.
549.537	Imagine you could back up a single power station with a single superconducting cable.
558.543	But what is the future of quantum levitation and quantum locking?
563.019	Well, let me answer this simple question by giving you an example.
570.158	Imagine you would have a disk similar to the one I have here in my hand,
576.571	three-inch diameter, with a single difference.
580.45	The superconducting layer, instead of being half a micron thin,
585.635	being two millimeters thin, quite thin.
588.723	This two-millimeter-thin superconducting layer could hold 1,000 kilograms, a small car, in my hand.
599.458	Amazing. Thank you.
602.754	(Applause)
