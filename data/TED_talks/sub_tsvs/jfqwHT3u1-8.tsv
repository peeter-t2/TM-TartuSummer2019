16.7	Openness. It's a word that
19.065	denotes opportunity and possibilities.
22.144	Open-ended, open hearth,
24.184	open source, open door policy,
27.537	open bar. (Laughter)
31.073	And everywhere the world is opening up,
33.593	and it's a good thing.
35.093	Why is this happening?
36.869	The technology revolution is opening the world.
39.833	Yesterday's Internet was a platform
42.378	for the presentation of content.
44.97	The Internet of today is a platform for computation.
48.225	The Internet is becoming a giant
49.832	global computer, and every time you go on it,
52.433	you upload a video, you do a Google search,
55.09	you remix something,
56.744	you're programming this big global computer
59.291	that we all share.
60.531	Humanity is building a machine,
63.765	and this enables us to collaborate in new ways.
66.839	Collaboration can occur on
68.155	an astronomical basis.
71.129	Now a new generation is opening up the world as well.
74.537	I started studying kids about 15 years ago,
77.226	-- so actually 20 years ago now --
79.185	and I noticed how my own children were
80.78	effortlessly able to use all this sophisticated technology,
84.297	and at first I thought,
85.514	"""My children are prodigies!"" (Laughter)"
88.479	But then I noticed all their friends were like them,
90.605	so that was a bad theory.
92.549	So I've started working with a few hundred kids,
95.544	and I came to the conclusion
97.139	that this is the first generation to come of age
99.197	in the digital age,
100.331	to be bathed in bits.
101.952	I call them the Net Generation.
104.288	I said, these kids are different.
105.638	They have no fear of technology, because it's not there.
108.516	It's like the air.
109.977	It's sort of like, I have no fear of a refrigerator.
113.8	And — (Laughter)
116.33	And there's no more powerful force to change
118.168	every institution than the first generation of digital natives.
122.876	I'm a digital immigrant.
124.23	I had to learn the language.
127.171	The global economic crisis is opening up the world as well.
130.44	Our opaque institutions from the Industrial Age,
133.47	everything from old models of the corporation,
135.839	government, media, Wall Street,
138.32	are in various stages of being stalled or frozen
141.896	or in atrophy or even failing,
144.822	and this is now creating a burning platform in the world.
147.832	I mean, think about Wall Street.
149.661	The core modus operandi of Wall Street almost brought down
152.872	global capitalism.
155.37	Now, you know the idea of a burning platform,
156.933	that you're somewhere where the costs of staying where you are
161.103	become greater than the costs of moving to something different,
164.304	perhaps something radically different.
167.477	And we need to change
169.205	and open up all of our institutions.
171.298	So this technology push,
172.98	a demographic kick from a new generation
175.872	and a demand pull from a new
178.74	economic global environment
181.167	is causing the world to open up.
182.86	Now, I think, in fact,
185.98	we're at a turning point in human history,
189.183	where we can finally now rebuild
191.128	many of the institutions of the Industrial Age
193.566	around a new set of principles.
195.123	Now, what is openness?
197.487	Well, as it turns out, openness
199.062	has a number of different meanings,
201.304	and for each there's a corresponding principle
204.207	for the transformation of
205.876	civilization.
207.9	The first is collaboration.
211.175	Now, this is openness in the sense of the boundaries
213.99	of organizations becoming more porous and fluid
216.949	and open.
218.813	The guy in the picture here,
220.349	I'll tell you his story.
221.478	His name is Rob McEwen.
223.383	"I'd like to say, ""I have this think tank, we scour the world"
225.965	"for amazing case studies."""
227.619	The reason I know this story
229.277	is because he's my neighbor. (Laughter)
233.438	He actually moved across the street from us,
235.205	and he held a cocktail party
236.484	"to meet the neighbors, and he says, ""You're Don Tapscott."
238.929	"I've read some of your books."""
239.838	"I said, ""Great. What do you do?"""
240.938	"And he says, ""Well I used to be a banker"
242.255	"and now I'm a gold miner."""
243.703	And he tells me this amazing story.
246.693	He takes over this gold mine, and his geologists
249.184	can't tell him where the gold is.
250.471	He gives them more money for geological data,
252.198	they come back, they can't tell
253.827	him where to go into production.
255.689	After a few years, he's so frustrated he's ready
259.669	to give up, but he has an epiphany one day.
262.046	"He wonders, ""If my geologists don't know where the gold is,"
264.82	"maybe somebody else does."""
267.19	"So he does a ""radical"" thing."
269.193	He takes his geological data,
270.7	he publishes it and he holds a contest on the Internet
273.463	called the Goldcorp Challenge.
274.954	It's basically half a million dollars in prize money
278.534	for anybody who can tell me, do I have any gold,
281.246	and if so, where is it? (Laughter)
285.182	He gets submissions from all around the world.
287.329	They use techniques that he's never heard of,
289.586	and for his half a million dollars in prize money,
291.754	Rob McEwen finds 3.4 billion dollars worth of gold.
295.939	The market value of his company
297.712	goes from 90 million to 10 billion dollars,
300.03	and I can tell you, because he's my neighbor,
302.722	he's a happy camper. (Laughter)
306.212	You know, conventional wisdom says talent is inside, right?
309.9	Your most precious asset goes out the elevator every night.
313.011	He viewed talent differently.
315.516	He wondered, who are their peers?
317.812	He should have fired his geology department, but he didn't.
321.881	You know, some of the best submissions
324.212	didn't come from geologists.
326.443	They came from computer scientists, engineers.
328.939	The winner was a computer graphics company
330.19	that built a three dimensional model of the mine
332.006	where you can helicopter underground
333.829	and see where the gold is.
336.499	He helped us understand that social media's becoming
339.602	social production.
341.675	It's not about hooking up online.
343.419	This is a new means of production in the making.
346.494	And this Ideagora that he created, an open market, agora,
350.491	for uniquely qualified minds,
353.49	was part of a change, a profound change in the deep structure
358.225	and architecture of our organizations,
360.683	and how we sort of orchestrate capability to innovate,
364.285	to create goods and services,
365.985	to engage with the rest of the world,
367.108	in terms of government, how we create public value.
371.513	Openness is about collaboration.
373.499	Now secondly, openness is about transparency.
375.865	This is different. Here, we're talking about the communication
378.055	of pertinent information to stakeholders of organizations:
381.89	employees, customers, business partners, shareholders,
384.807	and so on.
386.569	And everywhere, our institutions are becoming naked.
390.842	People are all bent out of shape about WikiLeaks,
393.329	but that's just the tip of the iceberg.
395.785	You see, people at their fingertips now, everybody,
398.49	not just Julian Assange,
400.715	have these powerful tools for finding out what's going on,
403.306	scrutinizing, informing others,
404.763	and even organizing collective responses.
408.353	Institutions are becoming naked,
410.643	and if you're going to be naked,
412.45	well, there's some corollaries that flow from that.
415.165	I mean, one is,
416.028	fitness is no longer optional. (Laughter)
418.809	You know? Or if you're going to be naked, you'd better get buff.
423.13	Now, by buff I mean, you need to have good value,
426.595	because value is evidenced like never before.
428.575	You say you have good products.
429.539	They'd better be good.
430.58	But you also need to have values.
432.531	You need to have integrity as part of your bones
435.474	and your DNA as an organization,
437.882	because if you don't, you'll be unable to build trust,
440.355	and trust is a sine qua non of this new network world.
444.344	So this is good. It's not bad.
447.615	Sunlight is the best disinfectant.
450.31	And we need a lot of sunlight in this troubled world.
454.293	Now, the third meaning and corresponding principle
457.289	of openness is about sharing.
459.419	Now this is different than transparency.
461.14	Transparency is about the communication of information.
463.883	Sharing is about giving up assets, intellectual property.
468.301	And there are all kinds of famous stories about this.
470.571	IBM gave away 400 million dollars of software
473.508	to the Linux movement, and that gave them
475.609	a multi-billion dollar payoff.
478.62	Now, conventional wisdom says,
480.58	"""Well, hey, our intellectual property belongs to us,"
483.315	and if someone tries to infringe it, we're going to get out
485.618	"our lawyers and we're going to sue them."""
487.966	Well, it didn't work so well for the record labels, did it?
491.379	I mean, they took — They had a technology disruption,
496.483	and rather than taking a business model innovation
499.172	to correspond to that, they took and sought a legal solution
503.124	and the industry that brought you Elvis and the Beatles
505.437	is now suing children
507.469	and is in danger of collapse.
511.636	So we need to think differently about intellectual property.
514.477	I'll give you an example.
515.506	The pharmaceutical industry is in deep trouble.
518.388	First of all, there aren't a lot of big inventions
520.993	in the pipeline, and this is a big problem for human health,
523.347	and the pharmaceutical industry has got a bigger problem,
528.508	that they're about to fall off something
530.431	called the patent cliff.
531.952	Do you know about this?
532.72	They're going to lose 20 to 35 percent of their revenue
535.724	in the next 12 months.
537.351	And what are you going to do,
538.682	like, cut back on paper clips or something? No.
541.792	We need to reinvent the whole model of scientific research.
546.505	The pharmaceutical industry needs to place assets
549.969	in a commons. They need to start sharing precompetitive research.
553.904	They need to start sharing
556.247	clinical trial data,
557.705	and in doing so, create a rising tide that could lift all boats,
561.976	not just for the industry but
563.918	for humanity.
566.709	Now, the fourth meaning
569.114	of openness,
571.26	and corresponding principle, is about empowerment.
573.259	And I'm not talking about the motherhood sense here.
575.475	Knowledge and intelligence is power,
578.949	and as it becomes more distributed, there's a
581.788	concomitant distribution
584.333	and decentralization and disaggregation of power
587.964	that's underway in the world today.
589.893	The open world is bringing freedom.
592.983	Now, take the Arab Spring.
595.332	The debate about the role of social media
597.244	and social change has been settled.
599.238	You know, one word: Tunisia.
602.476	And then it ended up having a whole bunch of other words too.
604.822	But in the Tunisian revolution,
607.164	the new media didn't cause the revolution;
609.291	it was caused by injustice.
611.071	Social media didn't create the revolution;
615.308	it was created by a new generation of young people
617.629	who wanted jobs and hope and
619.437	who didn't want to be treated as subjects anymore.
623.463	But just as the Internet drops transaction and collaboration
626.528	costs in business and government,
628.896	it also drops the cost of dissent, of rebellion,
631.653	and even insurrection
633.482	in ways that people didn't understand.
635.574	You know, during the Tunisian revolution,
637.397	snipers associated with the regime were killing
640.091	unarmed students in the street.
641.835	So the students would take their mobile devices,
644.856	take a picture, triangulate the location,
647.509	send that picture to friendly military units,
649.71	who'd come in and take out the snipers.
652.119	You think that social media is about hooking up online?
654.653	For these kids, it was a military tool
657.68	to defend unarmed people from murderers.
660.806	It was a tool of self-defense.
662.939	You know, as we speak today, young people
665.294	are being killed in Syria,
667.304	and up until three months ago,
669.114	if you were injured on the street,
671.313	an ambulance would pick you up,
672.765	take you to the hospital, you'd go in, say, with a broken leg,
675.665	and you'd come out with a bullet in your head.
678.144	So these 20-somethings created
681.055	an alternative health care system,
683.349	where what they did is they used Twitter and basic
685.739	publicly available tools that when someone's injured,
688.984	a car would show up, it would pick them up,
691.664	take them to a makeshift medical clinic, where you'd get
694.223	medical treatment, as opposed to being executed.
697.765	So this is a time of great change.
700.95	Now, it's not without its problems.
703.584	Up until two years ago,
706.23	all revolutions in human history had a leadership,
709.383	and when the old regime fell, the leadership
712.175	and the organization would take power.
713.153	Well, these wiki revolutions happen so fast
715.678	they create a vacuum, and
717.176	politics abhors a vacuum,
718.911	and unsavory forces can fill that,
720.983	typically the old regime,
724.109	or extremists, or fundamentalist forces.
726.455	You can see this playing out today in Egypt.
729.19	But that doesn't matter,
730.853	because this is moving forward.
732.99	The train has left the station. The cat is out of the bag.
735.966	The horse is out of the barn. Help me out here, okay?
739.344	(Laughter) The toothpaste is out of the tube.
741.486	I mean, we're not putting this one back.
743.709	The open world is bringing empowerment and freedom.
747.442	I think, at the end of these four days,
750.226	that you'll come to conclude that the arc of history
752.992	is a positive one, and it's towards openness.
756.488	If you go back a few hundred years,
758.969	all around the world it was a very closed society.
761.353	It was agrarian, and the means of production
762.922	and political system was called feudalism, and knowledge
765.637	was concentrated in the church and the nobility.
769.575	People didn't know about things.
771.182	There was no concept of progress.
773.657	You were born, you lived your life and you died.
775.56	But then Johannes Gutenberg came along with his great invention,
780.156	and, over time, the society opened up.
783.708	People started to learn about things, and when they did,
785.749	the institutions of feudal society appeared
787.134	to be stalled, or frozen, or failing.
790.837	It didn't make sense for the church to be responsible
793.613	for medicine when people had knowledge.
795.895	So we saw the Protestant Reformation.
797.842	Martin Luther called the printing press
799.712	"""God's highest act of grace."""
802.109	The creation of a corporation, science, the university,
805.62	eventually the Industrial Revolution,
807.307	and it was all good.
809.481	But it came with a cost.
811.628	And now, once again, the technology genie
814.34	is out of the bottle, but this time it's different.
817.66	The printing press gave us access to the written word.
820.525	The Internet enables each of us to be a producer.
823.984	The printing press gave us access to recorded knowledge.
826.798	The Internet gives us access,
828.708	not just to information and knowledge, but
830.357	to the intelligence contained in the crania of other people
833.733	on a global basis.
835.27	To me, this is not an information age,
838.509	it's an age of networked intelligence.
841.383	It's an age of vast promise,
845.255	an age of collaboration,
848.383	where the boundaries of our organizations are changing,
852.562	of transparency, where sunlight
855.277	is disinfecting civilization,
858.5	an age of sharing and understanding
862.056	the new power of the commons,
863.762	and it's an age of empowerment
866.405	and of freedom.
869.296	Now, what I'd like to do is,
872.832	to close, to share with you
875.48	some research that I've been doing.
878.089	I've tried to study all kinds of organizations
880.6	to understand what the future might look like,
883.737	but I've been studying nature recently.
886.762	You know, bees come in swarms
890.392	and fish come in schools.
893.103	Starlings, in the area around Edinburgh,
895.916	in the moors of England,
897.399	come in something called a murmuration,
899.493	and the murmuration refers to the murmuring of the wings
902.265	of the birds, and throughout the day the starlings
904.178	are out over a 20-mile radius
906.043	sort of doing their starling thing.
908.084	And at night they come together
909.848	and they create one of the most spectacular things
911.97	in all of nature,
913.565	and it's called a murmuration.
915.619	And scientists that have studied this have said
918.536	they've never seen an accident.
920.282	Now, this thing has a function.
922.232	It protects the birds.
924.094	You can see on the right here,
925.694	there's a predator being chased away by the collective power
930.199	of the birds, and apparently this is a frightening thing
933.189	if you're a predator of starlings.
936.653	And there's leadership,
939.101	but there's no one leader.
941.239	Now, is this some kind of fanciful analogy,
943.34	or could we actually learn something from this?
945.786	Well, the murmuration functions to record
948.842	a number of principles,
950.205	and they're basically the principles that
951.724	I have described to you today.
953.638	This is a huge collaboration.
956.444	It's an openness, it's a sharing
958.223	of all kinds of information, not just about location
960.738	and trajectory and danger and so on, but about food sources.
965.753	And there's a real sense of interdependence,
969.89	that the individual birds somehow understand
973.577	that their interests are in the interest of the collective.
976.536	Perhaps like we should understand
978.785	that business can't succeed
982.953	in a world that's failing.
985.113	Well, I look at this thing,
986.67	and I get a lot of hope.
989.357	Think about the kids today in the Arab Spring, and
994.409	you see something like this that's underway.
997.265	And imagine, just consider this idea, if you would:
1001.405	What if we could connect ourselves in this world
1005.35	through a vast network of air and glass?
1009.195	Could we go beyond just sharing information and knowledge?
1012.027	Could we start to share our intelligence?
1014.536	Could we create some kind of
1016.978	collective intelligence
1018.699	that goes beyond an individual or a group or a team
1022.619	to create, perhaps, some kind of consciousness
1026.767	on a global basis?
1027.992	Well, if we could do this, we could attack some big problems in the world.
1031.665	And I look at this thing,
1033.536	and, I don't know, I get a lot of hope that maybe this
1036.451	smaller, networked, open world
1040.247	that our kids inherit might be a better one, and that
1043.351	this new age of networked intelligence could be
1046.664	an age of promise fulfilled
1049.288	and of peril unrequited.
1052.318	Let's do this. Thank you.
1055.664	(Applause)
