15.261	What I do is I organize information.
17.069	I'm a graphic designer.
18.826	Professionally, I try to make sense
21.569	often of things that don't
21.569	make much sense themselves.
25.198	So my father might not understand
25.198	what it is that I do for a living.
29.336	His part of my ancestry has been farmers.
31.613	He's part of this ethnic minority
31.613	called the Pontic Greeks.
35.24	They lived in Asia Minor
35.24	and fled to Greece after a genocide
39.676	about a hundred years ago.
41.834	And ever since that, migration
41.834	has somewhat been a theme in my family.
46.107	My father moved to Germany,
46.107	studied there and married,
50.632	and as a result, I now have
50.632	this half-German brain,
55.084	with all the analytical thinking
55.084	and that slightly dorky demeanor
58.466	that come with that.
60.469	And of course it meant
60.469	that I was a foreigner in both countries,
63.579	and that of course made it pretty easy
63.579	for me to migrate as well,
67.953	in good family tradition, if you like.
70.932	But of course, most journeys
70.932	that we undertake from day to day
74.281	are within a city.
75.931	And, especially if you know the city,
78.727	getting from A to B
78.727	may seem pretty obvious, right?
83.551	But the question is, why is it obvious?
86.901	How do we know where we're going?
89.243	So I washed up on a Dublin ferry port
89.243	about 12 years ago,
93.092	a professional foreigner, if you like,
95.508	and I'm sure you've all had
95.508	this experience before, yeah?
98.634	You arrive in a new city,
100.746	and your brain is trying
100.746	to make sense of this new place.
104.743	Once you find your base, your home,
108.145	you start to build this cognitive map
108.145	of your environment.
112.605	It's essentially this virtual map
112.605	that only exists in your brain.
116.517	All animal species do it,
118.302	even though we all use
118.302	slightly different tools.
121.301	Us humans, of course, we don't move around
121.301	marking our territory by scent, like dogs.
127.35	We don't run around emitting
127.35	ultrasonic squeaks, like bats.
132.866	We just don't do that,
134.887	although a night in the Temple Bar
134.887	district can get pretty wild.
138.157	(Laughter)
139.529	No, we do two important things
139.529	to make a place our own.
143.467	First, we move along linear routes.
146.543	Typically, we find a main street,
149.037	and this main street becomes
149.037	a linear strip map in our minds.
152.631	But our mind keeps it pretty simple, yeah?
154.878	Every street is generally perceived
154.878	as a straight line,
158.257	and we kind of ignore the little twists
158.257	and turns that the streets make.
162.37	When we do, however,
162.37	make a turn into a side street,
164.844	our mind tends to adjust that turn
164.844	to a 90-degree angle.
170.158	This of course makes for
170.158	some funny moments
172.88	when you're in some old city layout
175.23	that follows some sort
175.23	of circular city logic, yeah?
180.246	Maybe you've had that experience as well.
182.358	Let's say you're on some spot
182.358	on a side street
185.478	that projects from a main
185.478	cathedral square,
187.844	and you want to get to another point
187.844	on a side street just like that.
192.568	The cognitive map
192.568	in your mind may tell you,
196.538	"""Aris, go back to the main"
196.538	cathedral square,
199.963	take a 90-degree turn
199.963	"and walk down that other side street."""
203.7	But somehow you feel adventurous that day,
203.7	and you suddenly discover
208.159	that the two spots were actually
208.159	only a single building apart.
213.035	Now, I don't know about you,
214.4	but I always feel
214.4	like I find this wormhole
216.548	or this inter-dimensional portal.
219.345	(Laughter)
220.643	So we move along linear routes
224.174	and our mind straightens streets
224.174	and perceives turns as 90-degree angles.
230.22	The second thing that we do
230.22	to make a place our own
233.189	is we attach meaning
233.189	and emotions to the things
237.376	that we see along those lines.
240.265	If you go to the Irish countryside
240.265	and you ask an old lady for directions,
246.156	brace yourself for some
246.156	elaborate Irish storytelling
250.068	about all the landmarks, yeah?
252.046	She'll tell you the pub
252.046	where her sister used to work,
255.321	"and ""... go past that church"
255.321	"where I got married,"" that kind of thing."
258.716	So we fill our cognitive maps
258.716	with these markers of meaning.
263.303	What's more, we abstract
263.303	repeat patterns and recognize them.
268.954	We recognize them by the experiences
268.954	and we abstract them into symbols.
274.904	And of course, we're all capable
274.904	of understanding these symbols.
279.959	(Laughter)
281.019	What's more, we're all capable
281.019	of understanding the cognitive maps,
285.526	and you are all capable of creating
285.526	these cognitive maps yourselves.
291.268	So next time, when you want to tell
291.268	your friend how to get to your place,
294.885	you grab a beermat, grab a napkin,
294.885	and you just observe yourself
299.677	create this awesome piece
299.677	of communication design.
304.068	It's got straight lines.
305.504	It's got 90-degree corners.
308.006	You might add little symbols
308.006	along the way.
310.13	And when you look
310.13	at what you've just drawn,
314.273	you realize it does not
314.273	resemble a street map.
318.835	If you were to put an actual street map
318.835	on top of what you've just drawn,
323.134	you'd realize your streets
323.134	and the distances -- they'd be way off.
328.48	No, what you've just drawn
328.48	is more like a diagram or a schematic.
334.116	It's a visual construct
334.116	of lines, dots, letters,
339.087	designed in the language of our brains.
341.979	So it's no big surprise
343.859	that the big information-design icon
343.859	of the last century --
348.842	the pinnacle of showing everybody
348.842	how to get from A to B,
353.199	the London Underground map --
355.241	was not designed by a cartographer
355.241	or a city planner;
359.578	it was designed
359.578	by an engineering draftsman.
363.974	In the 1930s,
365.708	Harry Beck applied the principles
365.708	of schematic diagram design
371.884	and changed the way public transport
371.884	maps are designed forever.
376.53	Now the very key
376.53	to the success of this map
380.249	is in the omission
380.249	of less important information
384.333	and in the extreme simplification.
387.052	So, straightened streets,
387.052	corners of 90 and 45 degrees,
391.012	but also the extreme geographic
391.012	distortion in that map.
397.156	If you were to look at the actual
397.156	locations of these stations,
401.086	you'd see they're very different.
403.753	But this is all for the clarity
403.753	of the public Tube map.
408.341	If you, say, wanted to get
408.341	from Regent's Park station
411.509	to Great Portland Street,
413.159	the Tube map would tell you:
415.017	take the Tube, go to Baker Street,
415.017	change over, take another Tube.
419.653	Of course, what you don't know
419.653	is that the two stations
423.574	are only about a hundred meters apart.
426.142	Now we've reached the subject
426.142	of public transport,
429.053	and public transport here in Dublin
432.121	is a somewhat touchy subject.
434.128	(Laughter)
436.431	For everybody who does not know
436.431	the public transport here in Dublin,
439.668	essentially, we have this system
439.668	of local buses that grew with the city.
444.635	For every outskirt that was added,
444.635	there was another bus route added,
448.283	running from the outskirt
448.283	all the way to the city center.
453.227	And as these local buses
453.227	approach the city center,
457.22	they all run side by side and converge
457.22	in pretty much one main street.
462.795	So when I stepped off
462.795	the boat 12 years ago,
466.732	I tried to make sense of that.
470.817	Because exploring a city on foot
470.817	only gets you so far.
475.234	But when you explore a foreign
475.234	and new public transport system,
480.587	you will build a cognitive map
480.587	in your mind in pretty much the same way.
486.362	Typically, you choose yourself
486.362	a rapid transport route,
491.119	and in your mind, this route
491.119	is perceived as a straight line.
495.555	And like a pearl necklace,
497.231	all the stations and stops are nicely
497.231	and neatly aligned along the line.
502.849	And only then you start to discover
502.849	some local bus routes
508.527	that would fill in the gaps,
510.266	and that allow for those wormhole,
510.266	inter-dimensional portal shortcuts.
516.947	So I tried to make sense,
516.947	and when I arrived,
520.363	I was looking for some
520.363	information leaflets
522.927	that would help me crack this system
522.927	and understand it,
526.468	and I found those brochures.
528.633	(Laughter)
532.734	They were not geographically distorted.
536.103	They had a lot of omission of information,
540.107	but unfortunately, the wrong information.
542.498	Say, in the city center --
544.272	there were never actually any lines
544.272	that showed the routes.
547.523	(Laughter)
548.691	There are actually not even
548.691	any stations with names.
553.465	(Laughter)
554.735	Now, the maps of Dublin transport
554.735	have gotten better,
560.382	and after I finished the project,
560.382	they got a good bit better,
565.572	but still no station names,
565.572	still no routes.
568.635	So, being naive,
568.635	and being half-German, I decided,
574.769	"""Aris, why don't you build your own map?"""
577.872	So that's what I did.
579.211	I researched how each and every bus route
579.211	moved through the city, nice and logical,
585.223	every bus route a separate line.
587.938	I plotted it into my own map of Dublin,
591.319	and in the city center ...
593.93	I got a nice spaghetti plate.
595.584	(Laughter)
598.136	Now, this is a bit of a mess,
601.209	so I decided, of course,
603.383	"""You're going to apply"
603.383	"the rules of schematic design,"""
606.962	cleaning up the corridors,
608.847	widening the streets
608.847	where there were loads of buses
611.626	and making the streets at straight,
616.435	or fractions of that,
617.888	and filled it in with the bus routes.
620.898	And I built this city center
620.898	bus map of the system,
624.221	how it was five years ago.
626.61	I'll zoom in again
626.61	so that you get the full impact
628.996	of the quays and Westmoreland Street.
631.346	(Laughter)
634.037	Now I can proudly say --
636.051	(Applause)
642.403	I can proudly say,
642.403	as a public transport map,
646.608	this diagram is an utter failure.
650.564	(Laughter)
652.475	Except, probably, in one aspect:
654.534	I now had a great visual representation
657.186	of just how clogged up and overrun
657.186	the city center really was.
661.775	Now, call me old-fashioned,
664.431	but I think a public transport
664.431	route map should have lines,
667.938	because that's what they are, yeah?
670.055	They're little pieces of string
670.055	that wrap their way
673.295	through the city center
673.295	or through the city.
675.999	If you will, the Greek guy inside of me
675.999	feels if I don't get a line,
681.514	it's like entering
681.514	the labyrinth of the Minotaur
684.607	without having Ariadne giving you
684.607	the string to find your way.
687.895	So the outcome of my academic research,
691.862	loads of questionnaires, case studies
691.862	and looking at a lot of maps,
698.659	was that a lot of the problems
698.659	and shortcomings
701.096	of the public transport
701.096	system here in Dublin
703.442	was the lack of a coherent
703.442	public transport map --
705.872	a simplified, coherent
705.872	public transport map --
708.613	because I think this is the crucial
708.613	step to understanding
712.052	a public transport network
712.052	on a physical level,
715.273	but it's also the crucial step to make
715.273	a public transport network mappable
719.592	on a visual level.
721.599	So I teamed up with a gentleman
721.599	called James Leahy,
725.533	a civil engineer and a recent
725.533	master's graduate
728.868	of the Sustainable Development
728.868	program at DIT,
732.202	and together we drafted
732.202	the simplified model network,
736.529	which I could then go ahead and visualize.
739.831	So here's what we did.
741.886	We distributed these rapid-transport
741.886	corridors throughout the city center,
748.2	and extended them into the outskirts.
751.1	Rapid, because we wanted them to be served
751.1	by rapid-transport vehicles.
757.315	They would get exclusive
757.315	road use, where possible,
761.249	and it would be high-quantity,
761.249	high-quality transport.
763.828	James wanted to use
763.828	bus rapid transport for that,
766.53	rather than light rail.
767.984	For me, it was important
770.135	that the vehicles that would run
770.135	on those rapid transport corridors
774.557	would be visibly distinguishable
774.557	from local buses on the street.
779.973	Now we could take out all the local buses
783.039	that ran alongside
783.039	those rapid transport means.
786.136	Any gaps that appeared
786.136	in the outskirts were filled again.
789.652	So, in other words,
789.652	if there was a street in an outskirt
792.889	where there had been a bus,
792.889	we put a bus back in,
795.976	only now these buses wouldn't run
795.976	all the way to the city center,
800.431	but connect to the nearest
800.431	rapid-transport mode,
803.995	one of these thick lines over there.
806.18	So the rest was merely
806.18	a couple of months of work,
809.349	and a couple of fights with my girlfriend,
811.472	of our place constantly
811.472	being clogged up with maps,
815.448	and the outcome, one of the outcomes,
817.465	was this map of the Greater Dublin area.
820.722	I'll zoom in a little bit.
823.808	This map only shows the rapid
823.808	transport connections, no local bus,
827.879	"very much in the ""metro map"" style"
827.879	that was so successful in London,
833.153	and that since has been exported
833.153	to so many other major cities,
837.449	and therefore is the language
837.449	that we should use
840.254	for public transport maps.
843.123	What's also important is,
843.123	with a simplified network like this,
848.664	it now would become possible for me
848.664	to tackle the ultimate challenge
854.166	and make a public transport map
854.166	for the city center,
857.763	one where I wouldn't just show
857.763	rapid transport connections,
860.883	but also all the local bus routes,
860.883	streets and the likes,
864.381	and this is what a map
864.381	like this could look like.
866.715	I'll zoom in a little bit.
871.186	In this map, I'm including
871.186	each transport mode,
876.252	so rapid transport, bus,
876.252	DART, tram and the likes.
881.459	Each individual route
881.459	is represented by a separate line.
888.493	The map shows each and every station,
892.673	each and every station name,
896.002	and I'm also displaying side streets.
900.776	In fact, most of the side streets
900.776	even with their name,
904.281	and for good measure,
904.281	also a couple of landmarks,
909.232	some of them signified by little symbols,
911.43	others by these isometric
911.43	three-dimensional
914.543	bird's-eye-view drawings.
916.565	The map is relatively small
916.565	in overall size,
919.222	so something that you could
919.222	still hold as a fold-out map
922.387	or display in a reasonably-sized
922.387	display box on a bus shelter.
926.069	I think it tries to be the best balance
930.737	between actual representation
930.737	and simplification --
934.093	the language of way-finding in our brain.
939.26	So, straightened lines,
939.26	cleaned-up corners,
942.815	and of course, that very, very
942.815	important geographic distortion
946.505	that makes public transport maps possible.
950.053	If you, for example, have a look
950.053	at the two main corridors
952.815	that run through the city --
952.815	the yellow and orange one over here --
956.111	this is how they look in an actual,
956.111	accurate street map,
959.713	and this is how they would
959.713	look in my distorted,
963.722	simplified public transport map.
966.676	So for a successful public transport map,
969.602	we should not stick
969.602	to accurate representation,
972.38	but design them in the way
972.38	our brains work.
974.765	The reactions I got were tremendous,
974.765	it was really good to see.
978.06	And of course, for my own self,
978.06	I was very happy to see
981.776	that my folks in Germany and Greece
981.776	finally have an idea
985.198	what I do for a living.
986.401	(Laughter)
987.427	Thank you.
988.602	(Applause)
