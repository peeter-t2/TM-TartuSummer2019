13.315	How many times have you used
13.315	"the word ""awesome"" today?"
16.362	Once? Twice? Seventeen times?
20.497	Do you remember what you were describing
21.863	when you used the word?
23.213	No, I didn't think so, because
23.213	it's come down to this, people:
26.453	You're using the word incorrectly,
28.355	and tonight I hope to show you
30.424	"how to put the ""awe"" back in ""awesome."""
33.506	Recently, I was dining at an outdoor cafe,
36.33	and the server came up to our table,
38.243	and asked us if we had dined there before,
39.79	"and I said, ""Yes, yes, we have."""
41.739	"And she said, ""Awesome."""
44.519	"And I thought, ""Really?"
46.754	Awesome or just merely good
49.376	"that we decided to visit your restaurant again?"""
54.04	The other day, one of my coworkers asked me
56.4	if I could save that file as a PDF,
58.88	"and I said, ""Well, of course,"" and he said, ""Awesome."""
62.621	Seriously, can saving anything as a PDF
68.848	be awesome?
71.796	"Sadly, the frequent overuse of the word ""awesome"""
74.956	"has now replaced words like ""great"" and ""thank you."""
79.123	"So Webster's dictionary defines the word ""awesome"""
83.495	as fear mingled with admiration or reverence,
87.623	a feeling produced by something majestic.
91.019	Now, with that in mind,
92.943	was your Quiznos sandwich awesome?
96.24	How about that parking space? Was that awesome?
98.51	Or that game the other day? Was that awesome?
101.056	The answer is no, no and no.
103.44	A sandwich can be delicious,
105.113	that parking space can be nearby,
107.415	and that game can be a blowout,
110.155	but not everything can be awesome.
114.38	(Laughter)
116.01	"So when you use the word ""awesome"""
117.659	to describe the most mundane of things,
120.977	you're taking away the very power of the word.
123.88	"This author says, ""Snowy days"
126.298	"or finding money in your pants is awesome."""
130.573	(Laughter)
131.451	Um, no, it is not,
133.433	and we need to raise the bar for this poor schmuck.
133.433	(Laughter)
139.831	So in other words, if you have
139.831	everything, you value nothing.
143.401	It's a lot like drinking from a firehose
145.771	like this jackass right here.
149.719	There's no dynamic, there's no highs or lows,
152.138	if everything is awesome.
154	Ladies and gentlemen, here are 10 things
156.165	that are truly awesome.
158.083	Imagine, if you will, having to schlep
160.766	everything on your back.
162.227	Wouldn't this be easier for me
164.22	if I could roll this home?
166.188	Yes, so I think I'll invent the wheel.
168.517	The wheel, ladies and gentlemen.
171.389	Is the wheel awesome? Say it with me.
174.186	Yes, the wheel is awesome!
177.809	The Great Pyramids were the tallest
179.87	man-made structure in the world
181.488	for 4,000 years.
183.872	Pharaoh had his slaves move millions of blocks
187.411	just to this site to erect a big freaking headstone.
191.427	Were the Great Pyramids awesome?
192.78	Yes, the pyramids were awesome.
195.03	The Grand Canyon. Come on.
197.176	It's almost 80 million years old.
200.404	Is the Grand Canyon awesome?
202.171	Yes, the Grand Canyon is.
203.712	Louis Daguerre invented photography in 1829,
208.47	and earlier today,
209.989	when you whipped out your smartphone
211.954	and you took a shot of your awesome sandwich,
214.566	and you know who you are —
216.311	(Laughter) —
218.527	wasn't that easier than exposing the image
220.867	to copper plates coated with iodized silver?
223.443	I mean, come on. Is photography awesome?
225.515	Yes, photography is awesome.
227.405	D-Day, June 6, 1944,
229.818	the Allied invasion of Normandy,
232.186	the largest amphibious invasion in world history.
236.282	Was D-Day awesome? Yes, it was awesome.
239.422	Did you eat food today? Did you eat?
241.973	Then you can thank the honeybee, that's the one,
244.301	because if crops aren't pollinated, we can't grow food,
247.395	and then we're all going to die.
249.217	It's just like that.
250.337	But it's not like a flower can just get up
252.682	and have sex with another flower,
255.154	although that would be awesome.
257.485	(Laughter)
260.304	Bees are awesome. Are you kidding me?
263.242	Landing on the moon! Come on!
267.198	Apollo 11. Are you kidding me?
270.171	Sixty-six years after the Wright Brothers
272.995	took off from Kitty Hawk, North Carolina,
275.605	Neil Armstrong was 240,000 miles away.
278.934	That's like from here to the moon.
280.959	(Laughter)
283.195	That's one small step for a man,
285.549	one giant leap for awesome!
288.131	You're damn right, it was.
290.152	Woodstock, 1969: Rolling Stone Magazine said
293.928	this changed the history of rock and roll.
297.097	Tickets were only 24 dollars back then.
299.707	You can't even buy a freaking t-shirt for that now.
303.339	"Jimi Hendrix's version of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"""
306.459	was the most iconic.
308.69	Was Woodstock awesome? Yes, it was awesome.
311.238	Sharks! They're at the top of the food chain.
313.987	Sharks have multiple rows of teeth
316.424	that grow in their jaw
317.669	and they move forward like a conveyor belt.
321.067	Some sharks can lose 30,000 teeth in their lifetime.
324.76	Does awesome inspire fear?
327.357	Oh, hell yeah, sharks are awesome!
331.103	The Internet was born in 1982
333.93	and it instantly took over global communication,
337.695	and later tonight, when all these PowerPoints
339.798	are uplifted to the Internet
341.756	so that a guy in Siberia can get drunk
344.58	and watch this crap,
347.549	the Internet is awesome.
350.303	And finally, finally some of you can't wait
352.79	to come up and tell me how
352.79	awesome my PowerPoint was.
355.952	I will save you the time.
357.62	It was not awesome, but it was true,
360.282	and I hope it was entertaining,
362.06	and out of all the audiences I've ever had,
365.407	y'all are the most recent. Thank you and good night.
368.107	(Applause)
