12.8	I spend most of my time
16.8	thinking about little girls,
20.28	which is kind of a weird thing
20.28	for a grown man in our society to say.
25.08	But I do. I spend most of my time
25.08	thinking about little girls,
28.04	and I think it's primarily
28.04	because I have one.
31.16	This one's mine, and I think
31.16	you would really like her.
34.24	She is smart and funny
36.72	and kind to people and a good friend.
39.96	But when I talk about my daughter,
39.96	the word I find myself saying most
44.36	"is ""athlete."""
46.4	My kid's athletic.
48.24	She is strong and fast
50.8	and has great balance
50.8	and good body control.
54	She is a three-time,
54	back-to-back-to-back state champion
57.4	in Shaolin Kempo.
59.08	At nine years old, she is already
59.08	halfway to a black belt.
62.8	My daughter is athletic.
64.6	Now, when a man who is six feet two
64.6	and 265 pounds stands in front of you
68.8	and says his daughter is athletic,
70.56	you might think
70.56	that's a reflection of him.
72.8	It is not.
74.04	(Laughter)
75.52	My wife in high school
75.52	was a two-time all-state soccer player
78.92	and a two-time all-state
78.92	volleyball player,
81.24	"and I played ""Dungeons and Dragons."""
83.28	And that is why,
85.4	although my daughter is an athlete,
87.36	she's also a huge nerd, which I love.
90.56	She walks around our house
90.56	in a cloak of flames
93.2	that she made herself.
95.4	She sits on the Iron Throne --
97.4	(Laughter)
99.2	even though she has never
99.2	"seen ""Game of Thrones,"""
101.56	primarily because we are not
101.56	the worst parents who ever lived.
105.44	But she knows there's someone
105.44	called the Mother of Dragons,
108.24	and she calls herself that
108.24	and she loves it.
110.36	She's a huge comic book fan.
112.08	Right now, her favorite
112.08	character is Groot.
114.16	She loves Groot.
115.4	She adores The Incredible Hulk.
118.08	But my daughter really at heart,
120.28	her thing is Star Wars.
123.32	My kid is a Jedi.
125.56	Although some days she's also a Sith,
127.36	which is a choice that I can respect.
130.6	(Laughter)
131.72	But here's the question
131.72	that I have to ask.
134.4	Why is it that when
134.4	my daughter dresses up,
136.72	whether it's Groot or The Incredible Hulk,
139.32	whether it's Obi-Wan Kenobi or Darth Maul,
142.88	why is every character
142.88	she dresses up as a boy?
148.32	And where are all the female superheroes?
150.36	And that is not actually the question,
152.24	because there's plenty
152.24	of female superheroes.
154.4	My question really is,
154.4	where is all the female superhero stuff?
158.64	Where are the costumes?
158.64	Where are the toys?
161.6	Because every day when my daughter
161.6	plays when she dresses up,
165.36	she's learning stuff
168.16	through a process that,
168.16	in my own line of work,
170.4	as a professor of media studies,
172	we refer to as public pedagogy.
173.96	That is, it is how societies
173.96	are taught ideologies.
179.2	It's how you learned what it meant
179.2	to be a man or a woman,
181.96	what it meant to behave
181.96	yourself in public,
184.56	what it meant to be a patriot
184.56	and have good manners.
187.32	It's all the constituent social relations
187.32	that make us up as a people.
191.2	It's, in short, how we learn
191.2	what we know about other people
195.24	and about the world.
197.04	But we live in a 100-percent
197.04	media-saturated society.
201.52	What that means is that every single
201.52	aspect of your human existence
205.04	outside of your basic bodily functions
207.44	is in some way touched by media.
209.92	From the car that you drive
209.92	to the food that you eat
212.4	to the clothes that you wear
213.8	to the way you construct
213.8	your relationships
215.84	to the very language
215.84	you use to formulate thought --
218.96	all of that is in some way mediated.
222.24	So the answer in our society
224.28	to how do we learn what we know
224.28	about other people and about the world
227.59	is largely through media.
230.88	Well, there's a wrinkle in that,
233.04	in that our society,
234.84	media don't simply exist as information
234.84	distribution technologies and devices.
240.16	They also exist as corporate entities.
243.04	And when the distribution of information
243.04	is tied to financial gain,
248.88	there's a problem.
251.08	How big of a problem?
252.52	Well think about this:
253.76	in 1983, 90 percent of American media
253.76	were owned by 50 companies.
260.52	In any market, 50 companies
260.52	doing something is a lot of companies.
264.84	It's a lot of different worldviews.
266.72	In 2015, that number has shrunk to six,
271.48	six companies.
272.839	They are NBCUniversal Comcast,
272.839	AOL Time Warner,
276.64	the Walt Disney Company, News Corp,
276.64	Viacom and the CBS Corporation.
282.48	These six companies produce
282.48	nine out of every 10 movies you watch,
286.48	nine out of every 10 television shows,
286.48	nine out of every 10 songs,
289.96	nine out of every 10 books.
291.76	So my question to you is,
293.68	if six companies control
297.4	how much influence do you think they have
297.4	over what you're allowed to see every day?
303.88	Because in media studies,
305.28	we spend a lot of time saying
305.28	that media can't tell us what to think,
308.56	and they can't; they're terrible at that.
310.84	But that's not their job.
312.24	Media don't tell us what to think.
314.2	Media tell us what to think about.
317	They control the conversation,
318.88	and in controlling the conversation,
320.64	they don't have to get you
320.64	to think what they want you to think.
323.68	They'll just get you thinking about
323.68	the things they want you to think about,
327.28	and more importantly, not thinking about
327.28	things they don't want you to think about.
331.2	They control the conversation.
333.16	How does this work in practice?
334.8	Let's just take one of those companies.
336.8	We'll do an easy one.
338.04	Let's talk about the Walt Disney
338.04	Company for a second.
340.6	The reason why I always pick
340.6	the Walt Disney Company is this.
343.52	Is there a single person in this room
343.52	who has never seen a Disney movie?
346.96	Look around. Exactly.
349.72	I picked Disney because they have
349.72	what we call 100 percent penetration
353.4	in our society.
354.64	Every single person
354.64	has been exposed to Disney,
357.04	so it's an easy one for me to use.
359.04	Since 1937, Disney has made most
359.04	of its money selling princesses to girls.
364.32	It's made a huge chunk of its money.
366.44	Unless, of course, the princess
366.44	your daughter is interested in,
369.44	as my daughter is, is this one.
371.88	See, in 2012,
374.2	Disney purchased LucasFilm
374.2	for the sum of four billion dollars,
378.84	and immediately they flooded
378.84	the Disney stores with Han Solo
382.68	and Obi-Wan Kenobi, with Darth Vader
382.68	and Luke Skywalker and Yoda
386.04	and not Princess Leia.
387.92	Why? Because this princess
387.92	messes up the public pedagogy
391.36	for these princesses.
393.16	So Disney did not put Princess Leia
393.16	merchandise in the store,
396.72	and when people went to Disney and said,
398.68	"""Hey, where's all"
398.68	"the Princess Leia stuff?"""
400.72	"Disney said, ""We have no intention"
402.4	of putting Princess Leia
402.4	"merchandise in the store."""
404.84	And fans were angry
404.84	and they took to Twitter
406.96	with the hashtag #WeWantLeia.
409.08	And Disney said,
409.08	"""Wait, that's not what we meant."
411.52	What we meant was,
413.2	we don't have any Princess Leia
413.2	"merchandise yet, but we will."""
416.92	And that was in 2012, and it is 2015,
420.32	and if you go to the Disney Store,
420.32	as I recently have,
422.876	and look for Princess Leia merchandise,
424.765	do you know how many Princess Leia
424.765	items there are in the Disney Store?
428.124	Zero, because Disney has no intention
428.124	of putting Princess Leia in the store.
431.728	And we shouldn't be surprised
431.728	because we found out that was their policy
435.16	when they bought Marvel in 2009
439.16	for the sum of 4.5 billion dollars.
442.08	Because when you make a lot of money
442.08	selling princesses to girls,
445.52	you also kind of want
445.52	to make money from boys.
447.92	And so what better to sell boys
447.92	than superheroes?
450.4	So now Disney had access
450.4	to Captain America and to Thor,
453.4	The Incredible Hulk,
454.76	and they had access even
457.56	to a group of superheroes
457.56	no one had ever even heard of.
460.32	That's how good Marvel was
460.32	at selling superheroes.
463.48	Last year, they released a film
463.48	"called ""Guardians of the Galaxy."""
466.92	It's a film that absolutely
466.92	should not work.
469.84	Nobody knew who they were
469.84	except for comic book nerds like me.
473.68	One of the characters is a talking tree.
476	One of the characters
476	is an anthropomorphic raccoon.
478.48	It should not work.
479.96	And they made a killing
479.96	"off of ""Guardians of the Galaxy."""
483.16	This character here in the middle,
483.16	her name is Gamora.
485.72	She's played by Zoe Saldana,
487.6	and she is strong and smart and fast
487.6	and fights like a ninja,
491.28	and she is played
491.28	by a beautiful black woman,
493.44	and my daughter fell in love with her.
495.64	So like any good nerd dad,
495.64	I went to buy my daughter Gamora stuff,
499.88	and when I got to the store,
499.88	I learned a very interesting thing.
503	If I wanted to buy her a Gamora backpack,
505.76	well, Gamora's not on it.
508.24	They probably should have marketed this
508.24	"as ""some"" of the Guardians of the Galaxy."
512.08	(Laughter)
514.16	And if I wanted to buy her a lunchbox,
514.16	she wasn't on it,
517.16	and if I wanted to buy her a t-shirt,
519.16	she wasn't on it.
520.56	And as a matter of fact,
522.48	if I went to the store, as I did,
524.72	and looked at the display,
526.24	you would find a small picture
526.24	of Gamora right here,
529.08	but if you look at any
529.08	of the actual merchandise on that shelf,
532.84	Gamora is not on any of it.
535.44	Now, I could have taken to Twitter
535.44	with the hashtag #WheresGamora,
539.12	like millions of fans did
539.12	across the world,
542.32	but the truth was
542.32	I wasn't even really that surprised,
546.44	because I was there
546.44	"when Disney had released ""The Avengers."""
550.4	And just this year, we got
550.4	"a new Avengers movie, the ""Age of Ultron,"""
553.76	and we were very excited,
555	because there was not one
555	but two female superheroes,
557.52	Scarlet Witch and Black Widow.
559.52	And we were very excited.
560.84	But here's the real thing about this.
563.08	Even though Scarlett Johansson,
564.88	who is one of the most popular
564.88	actresses in America, plays Black Widow,
568.36	and Black Widow is the star
569.72	of not one, not two,
569.72	but five different Marvel movies,
574.72	there is not a single piece
574.72	of Black Widow merchandise available.
579.36	Not one.
580.76	And if you go to the Disney store
580.76	and look for a Black Widow costume,
584.04	what you will find, is you will find
584.04	Captain America and The Incredible Hulk.
587.68	You will find Iron Man and Thor.
589.28	You will even find War Machine,
590.8	who isn't even really
590.8	in the movie that long.
593.6	Who you will not find is Black Widow.
596.04	And I could have gone to Twitter
596.04	with the hashtag, as many people did,
599.6	# WheresNatasha.
601.4	But I'm tired of doing that.
603.76	I'm tired of having to do that.
605.56	All over the country right now,
607.12	there are kids playing
607.12	with the Cycle Blast Quinjet play set,
610.6	where Captain America
610.6	rides a motorcycle out of a moving jet
614.6	and it's really awesome.
616.16	You know how awesome it is?
617.52	So awesome that when
617.52	it happened in the movie,
620	it was Black Widow that did it.
622.4	Not only has she been erased,
626	but she has been replaced
626	with a male figure.
631.64	And so what is this teaching us?
634.72	I mean, over the next five years,
636.64	Disney and Warner Bros.
636.64	and a bunch of movie studios
640.36	are going to release
640.36	over 30 feature-length films
643.8	with comic book characters,
645.28	and of those 30 feature-length films,
647.68	exactly two of them
647.68	will have female solo leads.
652.6	Two.
653.84	Now, there will be females
653.84	in the rest of these movies,
656.72	but they will be sidekicks,
656.72	they will be love interests,
659.4	they will be members of teams.
660.853	They will not be the main character.
662.68	And if what we learn, what we know
664.96	about other people and about the world
664.96	we learn through media,
668	then these companies are teaching
668	my daughter that even if she is strong
671.56	and smart and fast
671.56	and fights like a ninja,
674.8	all four of which are true of her,
677.88	it doesn't matter.
679.64	She will either be ignored like Gamora
682.08	or erased and replaced with a boy
684.76	like Black Widow.
686.92	And it's not fair.
688.6	It's not fair to her and it's not fair
688.6	to your sons and daughters either.
692.68	But here's the thing:
693.96	I'm raising a little girl,
693.96	and she has a little tomboy in her,
697.28	which by the way is
697.28	a terrible thing to call a girl.
699.8	What that basically is saying is,
699.8	those traits that define you,
703.04	they're not really yours,
704.28	they're just on loan to you
704.28	for a little while from boys.
707.56	But do you know how much grief
707.56	she's going to take in her life
710.88	for having a little tomboy in her?
713.32	Zero. None.
715.32	People will think it's cute.
716.72	They'll call her feisty,
716.72	because in our society,
719.36	adding so-called male traits to girls
721.8	is seen as an upgrade, seen as a bonus.
725	I'm not raising a little boy, like Mike.
728.4	Mike is a little boy in Florida.
728.4	He's 11 years old,
731.36	and the thing that he loves
731.36	most in the world
733.52	"is a show called ""My Little Pony:"
733.52	"Friendship is Magic,"""
736.48	like millions of other children
736.48	across America.
739.56	Now, the show is marketed to girls
739.56	ages five to nine,
743.08	but there are millions of boys
745.44	and grown men
747.24	"who enjoy ""My Little Pony:"
747.24	"Friendship is Magic."""
749.64	They have a club.
750.88	They call themselves Bronies,
752.76	pony bros, guys who like ponies.
756	I happen to be one of them.
757.92	And what are Mike and myself
761.48	and millions of other boys and men
761.48	learning in this feminine,
764.362	"sissified world of ""My Little Pony?"""
767.24	Well, they're learning to study hard
767.24	and to work hard and to party hard
772.12	and to look good and to feel good
774.2	and to do good,
775.76	and heaven preserve us from teaching
775.76	these wussified concepts to boys.
780.88	So the other kids in his neighborhood
780.88	pick on Mike and they beat him up
784.84	and they make fun of him,
786.12	and at 11 years old, Mike goes home,
788.6	finds a belt, wraps it around his neck,
790.96	and hangs himself
790.96	from the top bunk of his bed.
793.76	Because we have developed a society
796.36	in which you would rather be dead as a boy
796.36	than thought of as liking stuff for girls.
802.28	And that is not Mike's fault.
802.28	That is our fault.
805.48	We have failed him.
807.8	We have failed our children.
810.12	And we have to do better for them.
812.08	We have to stop making it
812.08	so that the only female superheroes
815	appear on shirts that are pink
815	and cut for girls.
818.84	We have to stop.
820.08	And when I was putting this together,
820.08	people said to me,
822.92	"""Well, that's never going to happen."""
822.92	"And I said, ""Oh really?"""
825.88	Because just this year, Target announced
827.84	that they were going to stop
827.84	gendering their toy aisles.
831.2	They were going to mix it up.
832.64	Now, before we break our shoulders
832.64	patting Target on the back,
836.24	just this week they released a shirt
838.2	in which one of the most
838.2	"iconic scenes in ""Star Wars: A New Hope"""
841.44	where Princess Leia stands up
841.44	to the Dark Lord of the Sith,
844.44	was released on a t-shirt
845.68	in which she's mysteriously
845.68	replaced by Luke.
847.96	So let's don't pat ourselves
847.96	on the back too much.
851	Just this week also,
852.52	Disney announced it was no longer
852.52	going to gender its Halloween costumes,
857	"which I say, ""Thank you, Disney,"
858.8	except the only costumes you make
858.8	are of male superheroes,
861.56	so does it matter
861.56	"who you have wearing them?"""
865.04	Just this week, Mattel, who makes Barbie,
867.28	announced they're going to release
867.28	a line of DC superhero girls.
870.76	And the funny thing is,
872.04	they met with girls
873.48	and asked them what they
873.48	wanted to see in dolls,
875.88	and you can see, they have calves
878.28	and elbows that bend
878.28	so they can do superhero stuff.
881.88	And please buy them.
883.44	And don't just buy them
883.44	for your daughters,
885.48	buy them for your sons.
886.84	Because it's important that boys
886.84	play with and as female superheroes
891.8	just as my daughter plays
891.8	with and as male superheroes.
895.8	As a matter of fact, what I would love
897.68	is a world in which every person
897.68	who goes to the store
900.28	goes with a little flowchart in their head
903	of whether or not they should buy
903	this toy for a boy or a girl,
906.12	and it's a real simple flowchart
906.12	because it only has one question on it.
909.525	"It says, ""Is this toy"
909.525	"operated with your genitals?"""
912.6	(Laughter)
914.88	If the answer is yes,
917.8	then that is not a toy for children.
919.64	(Laughter)
922.76	And if the answer is no,
925.96	then it's for boys and girls.
928.2	It's really simple.
929.72	Because today is about the future
929.72	of the future, and in my future,
933.72	boys and girls are equally respected,
937	equally valued, and most importantly,
937	equally represented.
942.52	Thank you.
