4.68	Today, I'd like to talk with you
6.4	about something that should be
6.4	a totally uncontroversial topic.
11.72	But, unfortunately,
11.72	it's become incredibly controversial.
17.72	This year, if you think about it,
19.96	over a billion couples
19.96	will have sex with one another.
24.16	Couples like this one,
26.72	and this one,
28.48	and this one,
29.96	and, yes,
31.6	even this one.
32.84	(Laughter)
34.76	And my idea is this --
37.16	all these men and women
37.16	should be free to decide
41.72	whether they do or do not
41.72	want to conceive a child.
46.2	And they should be able to use
46.2	one of these birth control methods
49.68	to act on their decision.
53.56	Now, I think you'd have a hard time
56.44	finding many people
56.44	who disagree with this idea.
60.76	Over one billion people use birth control
60.76	without any hesitation at all.
67.92	They want the power
67.92	to plan their own lives
72.08	and to raise healthier, better educated
72.08	and more prosperous families.
78.72	But, for an idea that is
78.72	so broadly accepted in private,
84.88	birth control certainly generates
84.88	a lot of opposition in public.
90.04	Some people think
90.04	when we talk about contraception
93.48	that it's code for abortion,
95.56	which it's not.
97.24	Some people -- let's be honest --
99.64	they're uncomfortable with the topic
99.64	because it's about sex.
103.84	Some people worry
105.6	that the real goal of family planning
105.6	is to control populations.
111.24	These are all side issues
115.08	that have attached themselves
115.08	to this core idea that men and women
120.88	should be able to decide
120.88	when they want to have a child.
125.76	And as a result, birth control has
125.76	almost completely and totally disappeared
132.36	from the global health agenda.
134.8	The victims of this paralysis
134.8	are the people of sub-Saharan Africa
141.04	and South Asia.
143.56	Here in Germany, the proportion of people
143.56	that use contraception
147.96	is about 66 percent.
149.72	That's about what you'd expect.
152.48	In El Salvador, very similar, 66 percent.
156.44	Thailand, 64 percent.
159.96	But let's compare that to other places,
162.32	like Uttar Pradesh,
162.32	one of the largest states in India.
166.04	In fact, if Uttar Pradesh
166.04	was its own country,
169.84	it would be the fifth largest
169.84	country in the world.
174.36	Their contraception rate -- 29 percent.
178.72	Nigeria, the most populous
178.72	country in Africa, 10 percent.
185.2	Chad, 2 percent.
190.16	Let's just take one country
190.16	in Africa, Senegal.
193.32	Their rate is about 12 percent.
195.4	But why is it so low?
197.92	One reason is that the most popular
197.92	contraceptives are rarely available.
204.08	Women in Africa will tell you
204.08	over and over again
207	that what they prefer today
207	is an injectable.
210.12	They get it in their arm --
210.12	and they go about four times a year,
214.16	they have to get it every three months --
214.16	to get their injection.
217.24	The reason women like it so much in Africa
217.24	is they can hide it from their husbands,
223.12	who sometimes want a lot of children.
225.8	The problem is every other time
225.8	a woman goes into a clinic in Senegal,
231.32	that injection is stocked out.
233.96	It's stocked out 150 days out of the year.
238.92	So can you imagine the situation --
240.8	she walks all this way
240.8	to go get her injection.
243.72	She leaves her field,
243.72	sometimes leaves her children,
246.92	and it's not there.
248.4	And she doesn't know
248.4	when it's going to be available again.
251.96	This is the same story
251.96	across the continent of Africa today.
257.4	And so what we've created as a world
257.4	has become a life-and-death crisis.
262.039	There are 100,000 women [per year]
262.039	who say they don't want to be pregnant
268.24	and they die in childbirth --
272.6	There are another 600,000 women [per year]
275.04	who say they didn't want to be pregnant
275.04	in the first place,
277.88	and they give birth to a baby
280	and her baby dies
280	in that first month of life.
284.36	I know everyone wants to save
284.36	these mothers and these children.
291.32	But somewhere along the way,
291.32	we got confused by our own conversation.
297.16	And we stopped trying to save these lives.
301.68	So if we're going to make
301.68	progress on this issue,
305.16	we have to be really clear
305.16	about what our agenda is.
309.4	We're not talking about abortion.
311.76	We're not talking
311.76	about population control.
315.16	What I'm talking about is giving women
315.16	the power to save their lives,
321.68	to save their children's lives
323.8	and to give their families
323.8	the best possible future.
328.6	Now, as a world,
330.48	there are lots of things we have to do
330.48	in the global health community
333.76	if we want to make the world
333.76	better in the future --
336.88	things like fight diseases.
338.68	So many children today die of diarrhea,
338.68	as you heard earlier, and pneumonia.
343.24	They kill literally
343.24	millions of children a year.
345.88	We also need to help small farmers --
348	farmers who plow
348	small plots of land in Africa --
352.52	so that they can grow enough food
352.52	to feed their children.
355.44	And we have to make sure that
355.44	children are educated around the world.
359.56	But one of the simplest
359.56	and most transformative things we can do
364.88	is to give everybody access
364.88	to birth control methods
368.76	that almost all Germans have access to
368.76	and all Americans, at some point,
374.24	they use these tools during their life.
377.52	And I think as long as we're really clear
377.52	about what our agenda is,
383.64	there's a global movement
383.64	waiting to happen
386.28	and ready to get behind
386.28	this totally uncontroversial idea.
393	When I grew up,
393	I grew up in a Catholic home.
396.32	I still consider myself
396.32	a practicing Catholic.
399.8	My mom's great-uncle was a Jesuit priest.
403.92	My great-aunt was a Dominican nun.
407.36	She was a schoolteacher
407.36	and a principal her entire life.
411.12	In fact, she's the one who taught me
411.12	as a young girl how to read.
415.56	I was very close to her.
417.8	And I went to Catholic schools
417.8	for my entire childhood
421.04	until I left home to go to university.
424.32	In my high school, Ursuline Academy,
427.72	the nuns made service and social justice
427.72	a high priority in the school.
434.6	Today, in the [Gates] Foundation's work,
436.96	I believe I'm applying the lessons
436.96	that I learned in high school.
442.64	So, in the tradition of Catholic scholars,
445.56	the nuns also taught us
445.56	to question received teachings.
451.72	And one of the teachings that we girls
451.72	and my peers questioned
457	was is birth control really a sin?
461.92	Because I think one of the reasons
463.68	we have this huge discomfort
463.68	talking about contraception
468.04	is this lingering concern
470.04	that if we separate sex from reproduction,
470.04	we're going to promote promiscuity.
476.08	And I think that's a reasonable question
476.08	to be asked about contraception --
480.36	what is its impact on sexual morality?
485.68	But, like most women,
487.04	my decision about birth control
487.04	had nothing to do with promiscuity.
492.36	I had a plan for my future.
492.36	I wanted to go to college.
495.84	I studied really hard in college,
498.2	and I was proud to be one of the very few
498.2	female computer science graduates
502.96	at my university.
504.8	I wanted to have a career,
504.8	so I went on to business school
508.16	and I became one of the youngest
508.16	female executives at Microsoft.
513.56	I still remember, though,
513.56	when I left my parents' home
516.679	to move across the country
516.679	to start this new job at Microsoft.
520.64	They had sacrificed a lot
520.64	to give me five years of higher education.
526.64	But they said, as I left home --
528.24	and I literally went down the front steps,
528.24	down the porch at home --
531.6	and they said,
532.84	"""Even though you've had"
532.84	this great education,
535.92	if you decide to get married
535.92	and have kids right away,
541.08	"that's OK by us, too."""
543.6	They wanted me to do the thing
543.6	that would make me the very happiest.
548.88	I was free to decide what that would be.
551.84	It was an amazing feeling.
555.2	In fact, I did want to have kids --
559.12	but I wanted to have them
559.12	when I was ready.
563.04	And so now, Bill and I have three.
566.52	And when our eldest daughter was born,
569.48	we weren't, I would say,
569.48	exactly sure how to be great parents.
573.2	Maybe some of you know that feeling.
575.76	And so we waited a little while
575.76	before we had our second child.
579.56	And it's no accident
579.56	that we have three children
583.24	that are spaced three years apart.
586.12	Now, as a mother, what do I want
586.12	the very most for my children?
592.04	I want them to feel the way I did --
594.76	like they can do anything
594.76	they want to do in life.
600.56	And so, what has struck me
602.2	as I've travelled the last decade
602.2	for the foundation around the world
606.8	is that all women want that same thing.
612.04	Last year, I was in Nairobi, in the slums,
612.04	in one called Korogocho --
617	which literally means when translated,
617	"""standing shoulder to shoulder."""
622.4	And I spoke with this women's group
622.4	that's pictured here.
625.44	And the women talked very openly
625.44	about their family life in the slums,
629.6	what it was like.
631.04	And they talked quite intimately
631.04	about what they did for birth control.
635.44	Marianne, in the center of the screen
635.44	in the red sweater,
638.6	she summed up that entire
638.6	two-hour conversation
642.36	in a phrase that I will never forget.
645.76	"She said, ""I want to bring"
645.76	every good thing to this child
653.04	"before I have another."""
655.64	And I thought -- that's it.
657.72	That's universal.
659.76	We all want to bring
659.76	every good thing to our children.
665.48	But what's not universal is our ability
665.48	to provide every good thing.
670.48	So many women suffer
670.48	from domestic violence.
673.2	And they can't even
673.2	broach the subject of contraception,
676.28	even inside their own marriage.
678.76	There are many women
678.76	who lack basic education.
682.36	Even many of the women
682.36	who do have knowledge and do have power
687.96	don't have access to contraceptives.
690.64	For 250 years, parents around the world
695.68	have been deciding
695.68	to have smaller families.
699.48	This trend has been steady
699.48	for a quarter of a millennium,
703.68	across cultures and across geographies,
707.32	with the glaring exception
707.32	of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.
714.44	The French started bringing down
714.44	their family size in the mid-1700s.
718.92	And over the next 150 years,
718.92	this trend spread all across Europe.
725.52	The surprising thing to me,
725.52	as I learned this history,
729.12	was that it spread not along socioeconomic
729.12	lines but around cultural lines.
735.96	People who spoke the same language
735.96	made that change as a group.
739.84	They made the same choice
739.84	for their family,
742.44	whether they were rich
742.44	or whether they were poor.
746.92	The reason that trend
746.92	toward smaller families spread
750.16	was that this whole way
750.16	was driven by an idea --
753.84	the idea that couples
753.84	can exercise conscious control
758.88	over how many children they have.
762.16	This is a very powerful idea.
766.2	It means that parents have
766.2	the ability to affect the future,
770.92	not just accept it as it is.
775.48	In France, the average family size
775.48	went down every decade
779.56	for 150 years in a row
779.56	until it stabilized.
783.96	It took so long back then because
783.96	the contraceptives weren't that good.
789	In Germany, this transition started
789	in the 1880s, and it took just 50 years
795.24	for family size
795.24	to stabilize in this country.
798.64	And in Asia and Latin America,
798.64	the transition started in the 1960s,
803.28	and it happened much faster
803.28	because of modern contraception.
809.68	I think, as we go through this history,
809.68	it's important to pause for a moment
815.52	and to remember why this has become
815.52	such a contentious issue.
820.6	It's because some family planning programs
823.28	resorted to unfortunate incentives
823.28	and coercive policies.
829	For instance, in the 1960s, India
829	adopted very specific numeric targets
835.88	and they paid women to accept
835.88	having an IUD placed in their bodies.
840.72	Now, Indian women were
840.72	really smart in this situation.
844.12	When they went to get an IUD inserted,
844.12	they got paid six rupees.
847.64	And so what did they do?
849.48	They waited a few hours or a few days,
851.52	and they went to another service provider
851.52	and had the IUD removed for one rupee.
858.72	For decades in the United States,
861.8	African-American women
861.8	were sterilized without their consent.
867.4	The procedure was so common
869.64	it became known as
869.64	the Mississippi appendectomy --
873.72	a tragic chapter in my country's history.
877.92	And as recently as the 1990s, in Peru,
880.72	women from the Andes region
880.72	were given anesthesia
884.24	and they were sterilized
884.24	without their knowledge.
888.72	The most startling thing about this
891.36	is that these coercive policies
891.36	weren't even needed.
894.12	They were carried out in places
895.96	where parents already
895.96	wanted to lower their family size.
900.64	Because in region after region,
900.64	again and again,
903.96	parents have wanted
903.96	to have smaller families.
908.12	There's no reason to believe
909.92	that African women
909.92	have innately different desires.
914.04	Given the option,
914.04	they will have fewer children.
918.6	The question is:
920.12	will we invest in helping
920.12	all women get what they want now?
926.4	Or, are we going to condemn them
926.4	to some century-long struggle,
931.12	as if this was still revolutionary France
933.88	and the best method
933.88	was coitus interruptus?
939.84	Empowering parents --
939.84	it doesn't need justification.
945.08	But here's the thing -- our desire
945.08	to bring every good thing to our children
951.96	is a force for good throughout the world.
955.16	It's what propels societies forward.
959.12	In that same slum in Nairobi,
959.12	I met a young businesswoman,
963.08	and she was making backpacks
963.08	out of her home.
965.32	She and her young kids
965.32	would go to the local jeans factory
968.68	and collect scraps of denim.
970.44	She'd create these backpacks
970.44	and resell them.
973	And when I talked with her,
973	she had three children,
975.405	and I asked her about her family.
977.005	And she said she and her husband decided
979.12	that they wanted to stop
979.12	having children after their third one.
982.16	And so when I asked her why,
982.16	she simply said,
984.84	"""Well, because I couldn't run"
984.84	"my business if I had another child."""
988.36	And she explained the income
988.36	that she was getting out of her business
991.623	afforded her to be able to give
991.623	an education to all three of her children.
995.8	She was incredibly optimistic
995.8	about her family's future.
1001.68	This is the same mental calculus
1004.24	that hundreds of millions
1004.24	of men and women have gone through.
1008.44	And evidence proves
1008.44	that they have it exactly right.
1012.84	They are able to give their children
1012.84	more opportunities
1016.76	by exercising control
1016.76	over when they have them.
1021.8	In Bangladesh,
1023.12	there's a district called Matlab.
1025.08	It's where researchers have collected data
1025.08	on over 180,000 inhabitants since 1963.
1031.839	In the global health community,
1033.4	we like to say it's one of the longest
1033.4	pieces of research that's been running.
1037.119	We have so many great health statistics.
1039.32	In one of the studies, what did they do?
1041.879	Half the villagers
1041.879	were chosen to get contraceptives.
1046	They got education
1046	and access to contraception.
1049.2	Twenty years later,
1049.2	following those villages,
1052.4	what we learned is that they had a better
1052.4	quality of life than their neighbors.
1056.44	The families were healthier.
1058.16	The women were less likely
1058.16	to die in childbirth.
1061.32	Their children were less likely
1061.32	to die in the first thirty days of life.
1065.36	The children were better nourished.
1067.68	The families were also wealthier.
1069.72	The adult women's wages were higher.
1072.24	Households had more assets --
1072.24	things like livestock or land or savings.
1077.32	Finally, their sons and daughters
1077.32	had more schooling.
1082	So when you multiply these types
1082	of effects over millions of families,
1087.96	the product can be large-scale
1087.96	economic development.
1092.08	People talk about the Asian
1092.08	economic miracle of the 1980s --
1096.16	but it wasn't really a miracle.
1098.24	One of the leading causes
1098.24	of economic growth across that region
1101.8	was this cultural trend
1101.8	towards smaller families.
1107.12	Sweeping changes start
1107.12	at the individual family level --
1111.04	the family making a decision
1111.04	about what's best for their children.
1116.28	When they make that change
1116.28	and that decision,
1119.32	those become sweeping
1119.32	regional and national trends.
1123.68	When families in sub-Saharan Africa
1123.68	are given the opportunity
1127.84	to make those decisions for themselves,
1130.8	I think it will help spark
1130.8	a virtuous cycle of development
1134.08	in communities across the continent.
1138.52	We can help poor families
1138.52	build a better future.
1142.4	We can insist that all people
1142.4	have the opportunity
1146.12	to learn about contraceptives
1148.08	and have access
1148.08	to the full variety of methods.
1152.56	I think the goal here is really clear:
1155.44	universal access to birth control
1155.44	that women want.
1160.88	And for that to happen, it means that
1160.88	both rich and poor governments alike
1166.2	must make contraception a total priority.
1170.28	We can do our part,
1170.28	in this room and globally,
1174.28	by talking about the hundreds
1174.28	of millions of families
1177.56	that don't have access
1177.56	to contraception today
1180.48	and what it would do to change
1180.48	their lives if they did have access.
1185.2	I think if Marianne
1185.2	and the members of her women's group
1188.96	can talk about this openly
1191.28	and have this discussion
1191.28	out amongst themselves and in public,
1195.32	we can, too.
1197.28	And we need to start now.
1200	Because like Marianne, we all want
1200	to bring every good thing to our children.
1207.32	And where is the controversy in that?
1210.68	Thank you.
1211.92	(Applause)
1214.68	Chris Anderson: Thank you.
1222.88	I have some questions for Melinda.
1226.88	(Applause ends)
1228.2	Thank you for your courage
1228.2	and everything else.
1232	So, Melinda, in the last few years
1234.52	I've heard a lot of smart people
1234.52	say something to the effect of,
1239.92	"""We don't need to worry"
1239.92	about the population issue anymore.
1243.4	Family sizes are coming down
1243.4	naturally all over the world.
1246.92	We're going to peak
1246.92	"at nine or 10 billion. And that's it."""
1251.24	Are they wrong?
1252.48	Melinda Gates: If you look
1252.48	at the statistics across Africa,
1255.28	they are wrong.
1256.52	And I think we need to look at it,
1256.52	though, from a different lens.
1259.6	We need to look at it
1259.6	from the ground upwards.
1261.8	I think that's one of the reasons
1261.8	we got ourselves in so much trouble
1265.08	on this issue of contraception.
1266.8	We looked at it from top down
1268.205	and said we want to have different
1268.205	population numbers over time.
1271.76	Yes, we care about the planet.
1271.76	Yes, we need to make the right choices.
1275.08	But the choices have to be made
1275.08	at the family level.
1277.68	And it's only by giving people access
1277.68	and letting them choose what to do
1282.04	that you get those sweeping changes
1282.04	that we have seen globally --
1285.12	except for sub-Saharan Africa and those
1285.12	places in South Asia and Afghanistan.
1292.44	CA: Some people on the right in America
1294.56	and in many conservative cultures
1294.56	around the world
1299.88	might say something like this:
1301.72	"""It's all very well to talk about saving"
1301.72	lives and empowering women and so on.
1305.411	But, sex is sacred.
1308.52	What you're proposing
1308.52	is going to increase the likelihood
1312.56	that lots of sex happens outside marriage.
1314.8	"And that is wrong."""
1317.12	What would you say to them?
1319.2	MG: I would say
1319.2	that sex is absolutely sacred.
1322.48	And it's sacred in Germany,
1322.48	and it's sacred in the United States,
1325.6	and it's sacred in France
1325.6	and so many places around the world.
1328.72	And the fact that 98 percent of women
1328.72	in my country who are sexually experienced
1333.64	say they use birth control
1333.64	doesn't make sex any less sacred.
1337.84	It just means that they're getting
1337.84	to make choices about their lives.
1341.12	And I think in that choice,
1342.44	we're also honoring
1342.44	the sacredness of the family
1345.36	and the sacredness of the mother's life
1347.64	and the childrens' lives
1347.64	by saving their lives.
1349.92	To me, that's incredibly sacred, too.
1353.28	CA: So what is your foundation
1353.28	doing to promote this issue?
1358.04	And what could people here
1358.04	and people listening on the web --
1362.08	what would you like them to do?
1363.64	MG: I would say this --
1363.64	join the conversation.
1365.807	We've listed the website up here.
1365.807	Join the conversation.
1370	Tell your story about how contraception
1370	has either changed your life
1373.84	or somebody's life that you know.
1375.88	And say that you're for this.
1377.285	We need a groundswell
1377.285	"of people saying, ""This makes sense."
1380.024	We've got to give all women access --
1380.024	"no matter where they live."""
1383.44	And one of the things
1383.44	that we're going to do
1385.56	is do a large event July 11 in London,
1388.76	with a whole host of countries,
1388.76	a whole host of African nations,
1392.16	to all say we're putting this back
1392.16	on the global health agenda.
1395.32	We're going to commit resources to it,
1397.2	and we're going to do planning
1397.2	from the bottom up with governments
1400.36	to make sure that women are educated --
1402.48	so that if they
1402.48	want the tool, they have it,
1404.96	and that they have
1404.96	lots of options available
1407.08	either through
1407.08	their local healthcare worker
1409.2	or their local community rural clinic.
1412.44	CA: Melinda, I'm guessing that some
1412.44	of those nuns who taught you at school
1417.04	are going to see
1417.04	this TED Talk at some point.
1420.48	Are they going to be horrified,
1420.48	or are they cheering you on?
1423.4	MG: I know they're going
1423.4	to see the TED Talk
1425.52	because they know that I'm doing it
1425.52	and I plan to send it to them.
1428.68	And, you know, the nuns who taught me
1428.68	were incredibly progressive.
1431.84	I hope that they'll be very proud of me
1433.76	for living out what they taught us
1433.76	about social justice and service.
1437.72	I have come to feel
1437.72	incredibly passionate about this issue
1441.64	because of what I've seen
1441.64	in the developing world.
1444.44	And for me, this topic
1444.44	has become very close to heart
1449.32	because you meet these women
1449.32	and they are so often voiceless.
1452.4	And yet they shouldn't be --
1453.76	they should have a voice,
1453.76	they should have access.
1456.32	And so I hope they'll feel
1457.6	that I'm living out
1457.6	what I've learned from them
1460.44	and from the decades of work
1460.44	that I've already done at the foundation.
1464.72	CA: So, you and your team brought together
1464.72	today an amazing group of speakers
1469.12	to whom we're all grateful.
1472.2	Did you learn anything?
1474.04	(Laughter)
1475.28	MG: Oh my gosh, I learned so many things.
1475.28	I have so many follow-up questions.
1479.12	And I think a lot
1479.12	of this work is a journey.
1481.4	You heard the discussion
1481.4	about the journey through energy,
1485.28	or the journey through social design,
1487.64	or the journey in the coming and saying,
1489.584	"""Why aren't there any women"
1489.584	"on this platform?"""
1491.76	And I think for all of us who work
1491.76	on these development issues,
1495.16	you learn by talking to other people.
1496.96	You learn by doing.
1496.96	You learn by trying and making mistakes.
1499.84	And it's the questions you ask.
1501.36	Sometimes it's the questions you ask
1501.36	that helps lead to the answer
1504.76	the next person
1504.76	that can help you answer it.
1506.88	So I have lots of questions
1506.88	for the panelists from today.
1509.6	And I thought it was just an amazing day.
1511.68	CA: Melinda, thank you for inviting
1511.68	all of us on this journey with you.
1515.038	Thank you so much.
1515.038	MG: Great. Thanks, Chris.
