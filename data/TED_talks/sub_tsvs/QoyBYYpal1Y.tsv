13.387	Everything is covered in invisible ecosystems
17.106	made of tiny lifeforms: bacteria, viruses and fungi.
21.594	Our desks, our computers, our pencils, our buildings
25.698	all harbor resident microbial landscapes.
29.154	As we design these things, we could be thinking
31.914	about designing these invisible worlds,
34.728	and also thinking about how they interact
36.971	with our personal ecosystems.
39.727	Our bodies are home to trillions of microbes,
43.37	and these creatures define who we are.
45.73	The microbes in your gut can influence your weight and your moods.
49.608	The microbes on your skin can help boost your immune system.
53.066	The microbes in your mouth can freshen your breath,
56.075	or not,
57.547	and the key thing is that our personal ecosystems
60.526	interact with ecosystems on everything we touch.
63.594	So, for example, when you touch a pencil,
65.186	microbial exchange happens.
68.018	If we can design the invisible ecosystems in our surroundings,
72.914	this opens a path to influencing
75.537	our health in unprecedented ways.
78.928	I get asked all of the time from people,
81.392	"""Is it possible to really design microbial ecosystems?"""
85.462	And I believe the answer is yes.
88.01	I think we're doing it right now,
89.935	but we're doing it unconsciously.
93.043	I'm going to share data with you
95.008	from one aspect of my research focused on architecture
98.736	that demonstrates how, through both conscious
101.862	and unconscious design,
104.072	we're impacting these invisible worlds.
107.081	This is the Lillis Business Complex at the University of Oregon,
111.31	and I worked with a team of architects and biologists
113.994	to sample over 300 rooms in this building.
118.168	We wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building,
122.178	and to do this, we sampled dust.
125.488	From the dust, we pulled out bacterial cells,
129.396	broke them open, and compared their gene sequences.
132.8	This means that people in my group
134.527	were doing a lot of vacuuming during this project.
137.84	This is a picture of Tim, who,
140.36	right when I snapped this picture, reminded me,
142.814	"he said, ""Jessica, the last lab group I worked in"
145.384	I was doing fieldwork in the Costa Rican rainforest,
148.355	"and things have changed dramatically for me."""
152.112	So I'm going to show you now first what we found in the offices,
155.864	and we're going to look at the data through a visualization tool
158.94	that I've been working on in partnership with Autodesk.
162.48	The way that you look at this data is,
164.952	first, look around the outside of the circle.
168.53	You'll see broad bacterial groups,
171.552	and if you look at the shape of this pink lobe,
174.392	it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group.
177.408	So at 12 o'clock, you'll see that offices have a lot of
179.904	alphaproteobacteria, and at one o'clock
182.465	you'll see that bacilli are relatively rare.
186.66	Let's take a look at what's going on in different space types in this building.
191.023	If you look inside the restrooms,
193.045	they all have really similar ecosystems,
196.175	and if you were to look inside the classrooms,
198.503	those also have similar ecosystems.
201.369	But if you look across these space types,
203.783	you can see that they're fundamentally different
206.18	from one another.
208.335	I like to think of bathrooms like a tropical rainforest.
211.328	"I told Tim, ""If you could just see the microbes,"
213.815	"it's kind of like being in Costa Rica. Kind of."""
217.854	And I also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland.
222.377	This perspective is a really powerful one for designers,
226.589	because you can bring on principles of ecology,
230.016	and a really important principle of ecology is dispersal,
232.928	the way organisms move around.
235.655	We know that microbes are dispersed around by people
239.839	and by air.
240.91	So the very first thing we wanted to do in this building
243.747	was look at the air system.
245.6	Mechanical engineers design air handling units
248.832	to make sure that people are comfortable,
251.024	that the air flow and temperature is just right.
253.577	They do this using principles of physics and chemistry,
257.121	but they could also be using biology.
261.495	If you look at the microbes
263.607	in one of the air handling units in this building,
266.657	you'll see that they're all very similar to one another.
270.648	And if you compare this to the microbes
274.183	in a different air handling unit,
276.327	you'll see that they're fundamentally different.
279.039	The rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago,
282.59	and what that means is that mechanical engineers
285.447	are like eco-engineers, and they have the ability
288.123	to structure biomes in this building the way that they want to.
293.707	Another facet of how microbes get around is by people,
297.815	and designers often cluster rooms together
300.982	to facilitate interactions among people,
303.037	or the sharing of ideas, like in labs and in offices.
306.509	Given that microbes travel around with people,
309.183	you might expect to see rooms that are close together
311.856	have really similar biomes.
314.111	And that is exactly what we found.
316.591	If you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another,
319.758	they have very similar ecosystems,
321.957	but if you go to an office
325.096	that is a farther walking distance away,
328.144	the ecosystem is fundamentally different.
330.88	And when I see the power that dispersal has
335.425	on these biogeographic patterns,
337.705	it makes me think that it's possible
340.264	to tackle really challenging problems,
344	like hospital-acquired infections.
346.461	I believe this has got to be, in part,
349.067	a building ecology problem.
352.71	All right, I'm going to tell you one more story about this building.
356.502	I am collaborating with Charlie Brown.
359.967	He's an architect,
361.508	and Charlie is deeply concerned about global climate change.
366.841	He's dedicated his life to sustainable design.
369.785	When he met me and realized that it was possible for him
372.881	to study in a quantitative way
375.057	how his design choices impacted
377.633	the ecology and biology of this building,
380.593	he got really excited, because it added a new dimension to what he did.
385.102	He went from thinking just about energy
386.97	to also starting to think about human health.
390.458	He helped design some of the air handling systems
394.319	in this building and the way it was ventilated.
396.513	So what I'm first going to show you is
399.235	air that we sampled outside of the building.
402.794	What you're looking at is a signature of bacterial communities
406.961	in the outdoor air, and how they vary over time.
410.937	Next I'm going to show you what happened
413.925	when we experimentally manipulated classrooms.
417.574	We blocked them off at night
419.189	so that they got no ventilation.
421.455	A lot of buildings are operated this way,
423.632	probably where you work,
425.383	and companies do this to save money on their energy bill.
428.354	What we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant
432.281	until Saturday, when we opened the vents up again.
435.34	When you walked into those rooms,
436.922	they smelled really bad,
438.897	and our data suggests that it had something to do with
441.999	leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup
445.066	from people the day before.
447.745	Contrast this to rooms
449.917	that were designed using a sustainable passive design strategy
454.198	where air came in from the outside through louvers.
457.978	In these rooms, the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well,
462.775	and when Charlie saw this, he got really excited.
464.91	He felt like he had made a good choice
467.021	with the design process
468.755	because it was both energy efficient
471.15	and it washed away the building's resident microbial landscape.
476.439	The examples that I just gave you are about architecture,
479.481	but they're relevant to the design of anything.
481.994	Imagine designing with the kinds of microbes that we want
486.164	in a plane
487.582	or on a phone.
490.515	There's a new microbe, I just discovered it.
492.969	It's called BLIS, and it's been shown
495.849	to both ward off pathogens
498.033	and give you good breath.
500.178	Wouldn't it be awesome if we all had BLIS on our phones?
506.197	A conscious approach to design,
508.567	I'm calling it bioinformed design,
511.448	and I think it's possible.
512.934	Thank you.
514.372	(Applause)
