13	Compassion:
15	what does it look like?
19	Come with me to 915 South Bloodworth Street
24	in Raleigh, North Carolina, where I grew up.
28	If you come in you will see us: evening time,
31	at table -- set for ten but not always all seats filled --
38	at the point when dinner is ready to be served.
42	Since mom had eight kids,
44	sometimes she said she couldn't tell who was who and where they were.
49	Before we could eat, she would ask,
52	"""Are all the children in?"""
55	And if someone happened to be missing,
58	"we would have to, we say, ""Fix a plate"" for that person, put it in the oven,"
65	then we could say grace, and we could eat.
69	Also, while we were at the table,
72	there was a ritual in our family:
75	when something significant had happened for any one of us --
79	whether mom had just been elected as the president of the PTA,
84	or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination,
90	or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent --
96	the ritual at the family was, once the announcement is made,
100	"we must take five, ten minutes to do what we call ""make over"" that person --"
106	that is, to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way.
112	For when one is honored, all are honored.
117	"Also, we had to make a report on our extended ""visited"" members,"
124	that is, extended members of the family,
128	sick and elderly, shut in.
130	My task was, at least once a week, to visit Mother Lassiter
135	who lived on East Street,
137	Mother Williamson who lived on Bledsoe Avenue,
140	and Mother Lathers who lived on Oberlin Road.
143	Why? Because they were old and infirm,
147	and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything.
151	"For mom said, ""To be family, is to care and share and to look out for one another."
158	"They are our family."""
160	And, of course, sometimes there was a bonus for going.
163	They would offer sweets or money.
166	"Mom says, ""If they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them,"
170	you must always say, 'Nothing.'
172	"And if they insist, say, 'Whatever you mind to give me.'"""
177	This was the nature of being at that table.
180	In fact, she indicated that if we would do that,
185	not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude
190	from the members of the extended family,
192	"but she said, ""Even God will smile, and when God smiles,"
199	"there is peace, and justice, and joy."""
202	So, at the table at 915, I learned something about compassion.
209	Of course, it was a minister's family,
212	so we had to add God into it.
215	And so, I came to think that mama eternal, mama eternal,
222	is always wondering: Are all the children in?
227	And if we had been faithful in caring and sharing,
232	we had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world.
237	Now, it was not always wonderful at that table.
239	Let me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion.
244	It was Christmas, and at our family, oh, what a morning.
249	Christmas morning, where we open up our gifts,
252	where we have special prayers, and where we get to the old upright piano
256	and we would sing carols. It was a very intimate moment.
259	In fact, you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing,
265	and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed,
270	except that daddy messed it up.
272	There was a member of his staff who did not have any place
277	on that particular Christmas to celebrate.
281	And daddy brought Elder Revels to the Christmas family celebration.
288	We thought he must be out of his mind.
290	This is our time. This is intimate time.
293	This is when we can just be who we are,
295	and now we have this stuffy brother
298	with his shirt and tie on, while we are still in our PJs.
302	Why would daddy bring Elder Revels?
308	Any other time, but not to the Christmas celebration.
312	And mom overheard us and said,
314	"""Well, you know what? If you really understand the nature of this celebration,"
320	it is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love.
326	That's what the celebration is all about.
329	"It's time to make space, to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community."""
338	So, we sucked up.
340	(Laughter)
342	But growing up at 915, compassion was not a word to be debated;
349	it was a sensibility to how we are together.
355	We are sisters and brothers united together.
359	"And, like Chief Seattle said, ""We did not spin the web of life."
365	We're all strands in it.
367	"And whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves."""
371	Now that's compassion.
373	So, let me tell you, I kind of look at the world this way.
376	"I see pictures, and something says, ""Now, that's compassion."""
381	A harvested field of grain, with some grain in the corners,
390	reminding me of the Hebrew tradition
393	that you may indeed harvest,
395	but you must always leave some on the edges,
399	just in case there's someone who has not
402	had the share necessary for good nurture.
407	Talk about a picture of compassion.
410	I see -- always, it stirs my heart --
414	a picture of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
418	walking arm in arm with Andy Young and Rabbi Heschel
423	and maybe Thich Nhat Hanh and some of the other saints assembled,
428	walking across the bridge and going into Selma.
432	Just a photograph.
434	Arm in arm for struggle.
437	Suffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters
444	without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity
449	robbing us of a sense of unity of being.
453	So, there's another picture. Here, this one. I really do like this picture.
458	When Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated,
462	that day, everybody in my community was upset.
469	You heard about riots all across the land.
474	Bobby Kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message in Indianapolis.
483	This is the picture. They said,
486	"""It's going to be too volatile for you to go."""
489	"He insisted, ""I must go."""
492	So, sitting on a flatbed truck,
496	the elders of the community are there,
498	and Bobby stands up and says to the people,
502	"""I have bad news for you."
504	Some of you may not have heard that Dr. King has been assassinated.
508	I know that you are angry,
511	and I know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity
514	"to enter now into activities of revenge. But,"""
517	"he said, ""what I really want you to know is that I know how you feel."
524	Because I had someone dear to me snatched away.
530	"I know how you feel."""
533	"And he said, ""I hope that you will have the strength to do what I did."
539	I allowed my anger, my bitterness, my grief to simmer a while,
545	and then I made up my mind that I was going to make a different world,
550	"and we can do that together."""
552	That's a picture. Compassion? I think I see it.
556	I saw it when the Dalai Lama came to the Riverside Church while I was a pastor,
563	and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world.
570	He asked them to give a message,
573	and they each read in their own language a central affirmation,
580	and that was some version of the golden rule:
585	"""As you would that others would do unto you,"
589	"do also unto them."""
594	Twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire
600	affirming one message.
603	We are so connected that we must treat each other
607	as if an action toward you is an action toward myself.
613	One more picture while I'm stinking and thinking about the Riverside Church:
618	9/11. Last night at Chagrin Fall,
624	a newspaperman and a television guy said,
628	"""That evening, when a service was held at the Riverside Church,"
634	we carried it on our station in this city.
638	"It was,"" he said, ""one of the most powerful moments of life together."
646	We were all suffering.
648	But you invited representatives of all of the traditions to come,
654	and you invited them.
656	'Find out what it is in your tradition
660	that tells us what to do when we have been humiliated,
664	when we have been despised and rejected.'
668	And they all spoke out of their own traditions,
671	"a word about the healing power of solidarity, one with the other."""
678	I developed a sense of compassion sort of as second nature,
685	but I became a preacher.
687	Now, as a preacher, I got a job. I got to preach the stuff,
691	but I got to do it too.
693	Or, as Father Divine in Harlem used to say to folks,
697	"""Some people preach the Gospel."
700	"I have to tangibilitate the Gospel."""
702	So, the real issue is: How do you tangibilitate compassion?
708	How do you make it real?
711	My faith has constantly lifted up the ideal,
715	and challenged me when I fell beneath it.
719	In my tradition, there is a gift that we have made to other traditions --
725	"to everybody around the world who knows the story of the ""Good Samaritan."""
733	Many people think of it primarily in terms of charity,
740	random acts of kindness.
743	But for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly,
749	you will discover that a question has been raised
752	that leads to this parable.
754	"The question was: ""What is the greatest commandment?"""
758	And, according to Jesus, the word comes forth,
761	"""You must love yourself,"
763	you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind and soul,
767	"and your neighbor as yourself."""
771	"And then the person asked, ""Well, what do you mean, 'neighbor?'"""
777	And he answered it by telling the story of the man who fell among thieves,
783	and how religious authorities went the other way,
789	and how their supporters in the congregation went the other way;
793	but an unsuspecting, despised person came along,
798	saw the man in need,
801	provided oil and wine for his wounds,
805	put him on his own transportation,
810	and took him to the inn
813	"and asked the innkeeper, ""Take care of him."""
817	"And he said, ""Here, this is the initial investment,"
824	but if needs continue, make sure that you provide them.
830	"And whatever else is needed, I will provide it and pay for it when I return."""
837	This always seemed to me to be a deepening
840	of the sense of what it means to be a Good Samaritan.
844	A Good Samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched
847	in an immediate act of care and charity,
851	but one who provides a system of sustained care -- I like that,
855	'a system of sustained care ' -- in the inn, take care.
859	I think maybe it's one time when the Bible talks about a healthcare system
864	and a commitment to do whatever is necessary --
868	that all God's children would have their needs cared for,
871	"so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks, ""In regards to health,"
877	"are all the children in?"" And we could say yes."
880	Oh, what a joy it has been to be a person seeking to tangibilitate compassion.
889	I recall that my work as a pastor
892	has always involved caring for their spiritual needs;
897	being concerned for housing, for healthcare,
901	for the prisoners, for the infirm, for children --
905	even the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record
911	where they started off, where they are going.
913	To be a pastor is to care for these individual needs.
918	But now, to be a Good Samaritan -- and I always say,
922	and to be a good American -- for me,
925	is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care.
930	Compassion takes on a corporate dynamic.
935	I believe that whatever we did around that table at Bloodworth Street
942	must be done around tables and rituals of faith
947	until we become that family, that family together
953	that understands the nature of our unity.
956	We are one people together.
960	So, let me explain to you what I mean when I think about compassion,
966	and why I think it is so important that right at this point in history.
972	We would decide to establish this charter of compassion.
977	The reason it's important is because this is a very special time in history.
987	It is the time that, biblically, we would speak of as
991	the day, or the year, of God's favor.
995	This is a season of grace.
997	Unusual things are beginning to happen.
1001	Please pardon me, as a black man, for celebrating
1003	that the election of Obama was an unusual sign
1008	of the fact that it is a year of favor.
1012	And yet, there is so much more that needs to be done.
1019	We need to bring health and food and education
1024	and respect for all God's citizens, all God's children,
1030	remembering mama eternal.
1033	Now, let me close my comments by telling you
1037	that whenever I feel something very deeply,
1041	it usually takes the form of verse.
1045	And so I want to close with a little song.
1049	I close with this song -- it's a children's song --
1053	because we are all children at the table of mama eternal.
1059	And if mama eternal has taught us correctly,
1063	this song will make sense, not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering,
1069	but to all who sign the charter for compassion.
1072	And this is why we do it.
1074	"The song says, ♫ ""I made heaven so happy today, ♫"
1078	♫ Receiving God's love and giving it away ♫
1082	♫ When I looked up, heaven smiled at me ♫
1086	♫ Now, I'm so happy. Can't you see? ♫
1089	♫ I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? ♫
1094	♫ Sharing makes me happy, makes heaven happy too ♫
1098	♫ I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? ♫
1102	♫ Let me share my happy loving smile with you. ♫
1106	That's compassion. (Applause)
