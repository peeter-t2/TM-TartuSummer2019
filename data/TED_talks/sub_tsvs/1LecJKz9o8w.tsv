18.33	I'm going to read a few strips.
23.33	These are, most of these are
25.33	from a monthly page I do
27.33	in and architecture and design magazine
30.33	called Metropolis.
32.33	And the first story is called
34.33	"""The Faulty Switch."""
36.33	Another beautifully designed new building
40.33	ruined by the sound of a common wall light switch.
45.33	It's fine during the day
47.33	when the main rooms are flooded with sunlight.
51.33	But at dusk
53.33	everything changes.
55.33	The architect spent hundreds of hours
58.33	designing the burnished brass switchplates
62.33	for his new office tower.
65.33	And then left it to a contractor
67.33	to install these 79-cent switches behind them.
72.33	We know instinctively where to reach
75.33	when we enter a dark room.
77.33	We automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward.
81.33	But the sound we are greeted with,
84.33	as the room is bathed in the simulated glow
87.33	of late-afternoon light,
90.33	recalls to mind
92.33	a dirty men's room
94.33	in the rear of a Greek coffee shop.
97.33	(Laughter)
99.33	This sound colors our first impression of any room;
103.33	it can't be helped.
105.33	But where does this sound,
107.33	commonly described as a click, come from?
111.33	Is it simply the byproduct of a
114.33	crude mechanical action?
116.33	Or is it an imitation
118.33	of one half the set of sounds we make
121.33	to express disappointment?
124.33	The often dental consonant
127.33	of no Indo-European language.
130.33	Or is it the amplified sound
132.33	of a synapse firing
134.33	in the brain of a cockroach?
137.33	In the 1950s they tried their best
141.33	to muffle this sound
143.33	with mercury switches
145.33	and silent knob controls.
148.33	But today these improvements
151.33	seem somehow inauthentic.
154.33	The click is the modern
156.33	triumphal clarion
158.33	proceeding us through life,
161.33	announcing our entry into every lightless room.
165.33	The sound made flicking a wall switch off
169.33	is of a completely different nature.
172.33	It has a deep melancholy ring.
176.33	Children don't like it.
179.33	It's why they leave lights on around the house. (Laughter)
183.33	Adults find it comforting.
185.33	But wouldn't it be an easy matter
187.33	to wire a wall switch
190.33	so that it triggers the muted horn of a steam ship?
194.33	Or the recorded crowing of a rooster?
199.33	Or the distant peel of thunder?
203.33	Thomas Edison went through
205.33	thousands of unlikely substances
208.33	before he came upon the right one
210.33	for the filament of his electric light bulb.
215.33	Why have we settled so quickly
217.33	for the sound of its switch?
220.33	That's the end of that.
222.33	(Applause)
225.33	The next story is called
228.33	"""In Praise of the Taxpayer."""
231.33	That so many of the city's most venerable taxpayers
235.33	have survived yet another commercial building boom,
240.33	is cause for celebration.
242.33	These one or two story structures,
246.33	designed to yield only enough income
249.33	to cover the taxes on the land
251.33	on which they stand,
253.33	were not meant to be permanent buildings.
257.33	Yet for one reason or another
259.33	they have confounded the efforts of developers
263.33	to be combined into lots
265.33	suitable for high-rise construction.
270.33	Although they make no claim to architectural beauty,
274.33	they are, in their perfect temporariness,
277.33	a delightful alternative
280.33	to the large-scale structures
282.33	that might someday take their place.
286.33	The most perfect examples
289.33	occupy corner lots.
292.33	They offer a pleasant respite
294.33	from the high-density development around them.
297.33	A break of light and air,
300.33	an architectural biding of time.
303.33	So buried in signage
305.33	are these structures,
307.33	that it often takes a moment
309.33	to distinguish the modern
311.33	specially constructed taxpayer
314.33	from its neighbor:
316.33	the small commercial building
319.33	from an earlier century,
321.33	whose upper floors have been sealed,
324.33	and whose groundfloor space
326.33	now functions as a taxpayer.
330.33	The few surfaces not covered by signs
333.33	are often clad in a distinctive, dark
336.33	green-gray, striated aluminum siding.
341.33	Take-out sandwich shops,
343.33	film processing drop-offs,
346.33	peep-shows and necktie stores.
349.33	Now these provisional structures have,
352.33	in some cases,
354.33	remained standing
356.33	for the better part of a human lifetime.
360.33	The temporary building
362.33	is a triumph of modern industrial organization,
366.33	a healthy sublimation
368.33	of the urge to build,
371.33	and proof that not every
373.33	architectural idea
375.33	need be set in stone.
379.33	That's the end.
381.33	(Laughter)
383.33	"And the next story is called, ""On the Human Lap."""
386.33	For the ancient Egyptians
389.33	the lap was a platform
391.33	upon which to place
393.33	the earthly possessions of the dead --
399.33	It was not until the 14th century
402.33	that an Italian painter
404.33	recognized the lap
406.33	as a Grecian temple,
408.33	upholstered in flesh and cloth.
412.33	Over the next 200 years
415.33	we see the infant Christ
417.33	go from a sitting to a standing position
420.33	on the Virgin's lap,
422.33	and then back again.
424.33	Every child recapitulates this ascension,
428.33	straddling one or both legs,
431.33	sitting sideways,
433.33	or leaning against the body.
436.33	From there, to the modern ventriloquist's dummy,
440.33	is but a brief moment in history.
443.33	You were late for school again this morning.
446.33	The ventriloquist must first make us believe
450.33	that a small boy is sitting on his lap.
454.33	The illusion of speech follows incidentally.
457.33	What have you got to say for yourself, Jimmy?
461.33	As adults we admire the lap
464.33	from a nostalgic distance.
468.33	We have fading memories
470.33	of that provisional temple,
472.33	erected each time an adult sat down.
476.33	On a crowded bus there was always a lap to sit on.
481.33	It is children and teenage girls
484.33	who are most keenly aware
486.33	of its architectural beauty.
490.33	They understand the structural integrity
493.33	of a deep avuncular lap,
496.33	as compared to the shaky arrangement
499.33	of a neurotic niece in high heels.
504.33	The relationship between the lap and its owner
508.33	is direct and intimate.
511.33	I envision a 36-story,
518.33	a reason to consider the mental health
521.33	of any architect before granting
523.33	an important commission.
526.33	The bathrooms and kitchens will,
528.33	of course, have no windows.
531.33	The lap of luxury
534.33	is an architectural construct of childhood,
538.33	which we seek, in vain,
540.33	as adults, to employ.
543.33	That's the end.
545.33	(Laughter)
548.33	"The next story is called ""The Haverpiece Collection"""
551.33	A nondescript warehouse,
554.33	visible for a moment
556.33	from the northbound lanes of the Prykushko Expressway,
561.33	serves as the temporary resting place
565.33	for the Haverpiece collection
568.33	of European dried fruit.
572.33	The profound convolutions
574.33	on the surface of a dried cherry.
577.33	The foreboding sheen of an extra-large date.
582.33	Do you remember wandering as a child
585.33	through those dark wooden
587.33	storefront galleries?
589.33	Where everything was displayed
591.33	in poorly labeled roach-proof bins.
596.33	Pears dried in the form
598.33	of genital organs.
601.33	Apricot halves
603.33	like the ears of cherubim.
605.33	In 1962 the unsold stock
610.33	was purchased by Maurice Haverpiece,
613.33	a wealthy prune juice bottler,
615.33	and consolidated to form the core collection.
620.33	As an art form it lies somewhere between
623.33	still-life painting and plumbing.
627.33	Upon his death in 1967,
631.33	a quarter of the items were sold off for compote
635.33	to a high-class hotel restaurant.
638.33	(Laughter)
639.33	Unsuspecting guests were served
642.33	stewed turn-of-the-century
644.33	Turkish figs for breakfast.
647.33	(Laughter)
648.33	The rest of the collection remains here,
651.33	stored in plain brown paper bags
655.33	until funds can be raised
658.33	to build a permanent museum
660.33	and study center.
662.33	A shoe made of apricot leather
665.33	for the daughter of a czar.
668.33	That's the end. Thank you.
671.33	(Applause)
