51.543	[Grand Canyon]
83.555	Narrator: Many of the tests are conducted
85.75	while Yves is strapped onto the wing,
87.56	because Yves' body
87.56	is an integral part of the aircraft.
90.341	[Wind tunnel tests]
93.603	Narrator: The wing has no steering
93.603	controls, no flaps, no rudder.
97.26	Yves uses his body to steer the wing.
100.26	Stefan Von Bergen: Well, he turns
102.26	by just putting his head
102.26	on one or the other side.
104.665	And sometimes he assists that
104.665	with his hands,
107.26	sometimes even with the leg.
109.701	He's acting as a human
109.701	fuselage, so to say.
113.824	And that's quite unique.
117.42	Narrator: When he arches his back,
117.42	he gains altitude.
130.188	When he pushes his shoulders forward,
130.188	he goes into a dive.
141.26	[Swiss Alps]
197.884	[Strait of Gibraltar crossing]
227.26	[English Channel crossing]
229.903	Commentator One: There he goes.
231.736	There is Yves Rossy.
233.976	And I think the wing is open.
236.26	So our first critical moment, it's open.
239.073	He is down. Is he flying?
242.092	Commentator Two:
242.092	It looks like he's stabilized.
244.31	He's starting to make his climb.
245.859	Commentator One:
245.859	There's that 90 degree turn.
248.098	He's out over the channel.
250.369	There is Yves Rossy.
251.722	There is no turning back now.
253.661	He is over the English Channel
253.661	and under way.
256.716	Ladies and gentlemen,
258.26	a historic flight has begun.
260.88	[Images: National Geographic]
280.425	Commentator Two:
280.425	And as he approaches the ground,
282.798	he's going to pull down
282.798	on those toggles to flare,
285.179	slow himself down just a little bit,
287.26	and then come in for a nice landing.
296.449	Commentator One: There he is.
297.927	Yves Rossy has landed in England.
302.623	Bruno Giussani: And now
302.623	he's in Edinburgh. Yves Rossy!
305.317	(Applause)
314.163	(Applause ends)
315.188	And his equipment as well.
316.537	Yves, welcome. It is quite amazing.
318.991	Those sequences were shot
318.991	over the last three years
322.242	in various moments of your activities.
324.126	And there were many, many others.
326.26	So it's possible to fly
326.26	almost like a bird.
328.625	What is it like to be up there?
330.736	Yves Rossy: It's fun. It's fun.
332.606	(Laughter)
334.637	I don't have feathers.
337.004	But I feel like a bird sometimes.
340.327	It's really an unreal feeling,
343.67	because normally you have a big thing,
346.369	a plane, around you.
348.26	And when I strap just this little harness,
353.81	this little wing,
355.39	I really have the feeling of being a bird.
357.666	BG: How did you start to become Jetman?
360.422	YR: It was about 20 years ago,
362.565	when I discovered free falling.
364.882	When you go out of an airplane,
364.882	you are almost naked.
369.299	You take a position like that.
371.386	And especially when you take
371.386	a tracking position,
375.22	you have the feeling that you are flying.
378.769	And that's the nearest thing to the dream.
382.954	You have no machine around you.
385.466	You are just in the element.
387.26	It's very short and only in one direction.
390.283	(Laughter)
391.343	So the idea was, okay,
394.289	keep that feeling of freedom,
397.652	but change the vector
397.652	and increase the time.
401.049	BG: So I'm kind of curious,
401.049	what's your top speed?
404.021	YR: It's about 300 km per hour
404.021	before looping.
407.26	That means about 190 miles per hour.
410.465	BG: What's the weight
410.465	of the equipment you're carrying?
413.094	YR: When I exit full of kerosene,
415.738	I'm about 55 kilos.
418.495	I have 55 kilos on my back.
420.969	BG: And you're not piloting?
422.397	There is no handle, no steering, nothing?
424.899	It is purely your body,
426.461	and the wings become part
426.461	of the body and vice versa?
428.962	YR: That's really the goal,
430.414	because if you put in steering,
433.174	then you reinvent the airplane.
435.839	And I wanted to keep this
435.839	freedom of movement.
440.45	And it's really like the kid
440.45	playing the airplane.
443.458	I want to go down like that.
445.132	And up I climb, I turn.
447.609	It's really pure flying.
450.982	It's not steering, it's flight.
453.859	BG: What kind of training do you do,
453.859	you personally, for that?
458.874	YR: Actually, I try to stay just fit.
462.26	I don't do special physical training.
467.351	I just try to keep my mobility
467.351	through new activities.
475.123	For example, last winter
475.123	I began with kite surfing.
480.107	So, new things.
481.26	So you have to adapt.
483.26	I'm quite an experienced
483.26	manager of systems as a pilot,
488.839	but this is, really --
490.26	You need fluidity,
492.648	you need to be agile
495.14	and also to adapt really fast.
497.64	BG: Somebody in the audience asked me,
499.474	"""How does he breathe up there?"""
501.26	Because you're going fast
501.26	and you're up at 3,000 meters or so.
504.261	YR: Okay, up to 3,000 meters,
506.537	it's not such a big problem with oxygen.
510.227	But for example, bikers,
512.813	they have the same speed.
514.808	Just with the helmet, integral helmet,
517.222	it's really no problem to breathe.
519.198	BG: Describe for me the equipment,
519.198	since you have it here.
521.989	So Breitling's four engines.
524.104	YR: Yeah, two-meter span.
526.846	Ultra-stable profile.
528.26	Four little engines,
532.696	turbines, working with kerosene.
536.06	Harness, parachute.
538.942	My only instruments
538.942	are an altimeter and time.
542.149	I know I have about eight minutes fuel.
545.82	So I just check before it's finished.
548.597	(Laughter)
551.629	And yeah, that's all.
553.915	Two parachutes.
556.701	That means, if I have a problem
556.701	with the first one I pull,
561.402	I still have the possibility
561.402	to open the second one.
565.044	And this is my life.
566.464	That's the real important
566.464	thing about safety.
570.067	I did use that during these last 15 years
573.663	about 20 times.
575.526	Never with that type of wing,
575.526	but at the beginning.
578.828	I can release my wing
581.891	when I am in a spin or unstable.
585.041	BG: We saw the 2009 crossing
585.041	of the Gibraltar Strait
587.758	where you lost control
589.26	and then you dived down into the clouds
592.069	and in the ocean.
593.26	So that was one of those cases
593.26	where you let the wings go, right?
597.081	YR: Yeah. I did try in the clouds,
599.53	but you lose orientation completely.
602.26	So I did try to take, again,
604.84	a climb altitude.
607.792	I thought, okay, I will go out.
609.864	But most probably,
609.864	I did something like that.
612.679	(Laughter)
613.773	BG: Something that is not
613.773	very safe, the image.
616.26	YR: You feel great, but --
619.329	(Laughter)
621.607	But you have not the right altitude.
624.07	So the next thing I saw was just blue.
626.792	It was the sea.
628.26	I have also an audible altimeter.
631.27	So I was at my minimum altitude
633.596	in that vector -- fast --
636.928	so I pulled that.
638.805	And then I did open my chute.
640.227	BG: So the wings have their own parachute,
640.227	and you have your two parachutes.
643.823	YR: Exactly. There is a rescue
643.823	parachute for the wing
646.458	for two reasons:
648.26	so I can repair it afterward
649.999	and especially so nobody takes
649.999	that, just on his head.
655.369	BG: I see. Maybe come back here.
657.624	This is risky stuff indeed.
660.077	People have died trying
660.077	to do this kind of thing.
663.026	And you don't look like a crazy guy;
663.026	you're a Swiss airline pilot,
666.146	so you're rather a checklist kind of guy.
668.936	I assume you have standards.
670.73	YR: Yeah. I have no checklist for that.
673.461	(Laughter)
674.583	BG: Let's not tell your employer.
676.258	(Laughter)
677.374	YR: No, that's really two worlds.
680.946	Civil aviation is something
680.946	that we know very well.
684.066	We have a hundred years of experience.
686.986	And you can adapt really precisely.
691.244	With that, I have to adapt
691.244	to something new.
694.26	That means improvise.
696.26	So it's really a play
696.26	between these two approaches.
699.514	Something that I know
699.514	very well, these principles.
702.753	For example, we have
702.753	two engines on an Airbus;
706.038	with only one engine, you can fly it.
708.417	So plan B, always a plan B.
711.028	In a fighter, you have an ejection seat.
712.958	That's my ejection seat.
715.009	So I have the approach
715.009	of a professional pilot
718.009	with the respect of a pioneer
723.278	in front of Mother Nature.
725.761	BG: It's well said.
728.26	What happens if one of the engines stops?
731.404	YR: I do a roll.
735.057	And then I stabilize,
738.365	and according to my altitude,
738.365	I continue on two or three engines.
742.361	It's sometimes possible.
743.942	It's quite complicated to explain,
747.143	but according to which regime I was,
750.537	I can continue on two
752.26	and try to get a nice place to land,
752.26	and then I open my parachute.
755.903	BG: So the beginning of the flight
757.548	is actually you jump
757.548	off a plane or a helicopter,
759.944	and you go on a dive
759.944	and accelerate the engines,
762.687	and then you basically take off
762.687	mid-air somewhere.
765.26	And then the landing, as we have seen,
767.26	arriving on this side of the Channel,
770.126	is through a parachute.
771.845	So just as a curiosity,
773.734	where did you land when you flew
773.734	over the Grand Canyon?
777.156	Did you land on the rim,
777.156	down at the bottom?
779.26	YR: It was down on the bottom.
781.554	And I came back afterward
781.554	on the sled of the helicopter back.
785.93	But it was too stony
785.93	and full of cactus on top.
790.363	(Laughter)
791.403	BG: That's exactly
791.403	why I asked the question.
793.569	YR: And also, the currents
793.569	are quite funny there.
797.418	There is big thermal activity,
799.648	big difference in altitude also.
801.704	So it was much safer for me
801.704	to land at the bottom.
806.201	BG: I think that right now,
806.201	many people are asking,
808.978	"""When are you developing a double-seater"
810.97	"so they can fly with you?"""
812.26	YR: I have a standard answer.
814.466	Have you ever seen tandem birds?
818.464	(Laughter)
819.491	BG: Perfect answer.
820.656	(Applause)
829.063	(Applause ends)
830.26	BG: Yves, one last question.
832.981	What's next for you?
832.981	What's next for Jetman?
835.26	YR: First, to instruct a younger guy.
839.595	I want to share it,
839.595	to do formation flights.
843.164	And I plan to start from a cliff,
845.702	like catapulted from a cliff.
847.607	BG: So instead of jumping
847.607	off a plane, yes?
849.632	YR: Yes, with the final goal to take off,
849.632	but with initial speed.
853.865	Really, I go step by step.
855.896	It seems a little bit crazy, but it's not.
859.004	It's possible to start already now,
859.004	it's just too dangerous.
862.583	(Laughter)
864.567	Thanks to the increasing technology,
864.567	better technology,
869.979	it will be safe.
871.286	And I hope it will be for everybody.
874.071	BG: Yves, thank you very much. Yves Rossy.
876.097	(Applause)
