12.835	If you've been thinking about US politics
16.14	and trying to make sense of it
16.14	for the last year or so,
20.627	you might have hit on something
20.627	like the following three propositions:
24.866	one, US partisanship
24.866	has never been so bad before;
31.032	two,
32.612	for the first time,
32.612	it's geographically spatialized --
36.41	we're divided between the coasts,
36.41	which want to look outwards,
40.381	and the center of the country,
40.381	which wants to look inwards;
43.522	and third,
44.825	there's nothing we can do about it.
49.05	I'm here to today to say
49.05	that all three of these propositions,
52.755	all of which sound reasonable,
54.783	are not true.
56.895	In fact,
58.12	our US partisanship goes all the way back
61.465	to the very beginning of the republic.
65.247	It was geographically spatialized
65.247	in almost eerily the same way
70.354	that it is today,
71.671	and it often has been
71.671	throughout US history.
75.642	And last,
76.816	and by far most importantly,
79.214	we actually have
79.214	an extraordinary mechanism
83.54	that's designed to help us manage
83.54	factional disagreement and partisanship.
89.433	That technology is the Constitution.
93.081	And this is an evolving, subtly,
93.081	supplely designed entity
98.999	that has the specific purpose
100.563	of teaching us how to manage
100.563	factional disagreement
104.072	where it's possible to do that,
105.99	and giving us techniques
105.99	for overcoming that disagreement
109.695	when that's possible.
111.771	Now, in order to tell you the story,
114.306	I want to go back
114.306	to a pivotal moment in US history,
118.594	and that is the moment
119.773	when factional disagreement
119.773	and partisanship was born.
123.797	There actually was a birth moment --
125.64	a moment in US history
125.64	when partisanship snapped into place.
130.601	The person who's at the core
130.601	of that story is James Madison.
136.012	And at the moment that this began,
138.765	James Madison was riding high.
142	He himself was the Einstein
142	of not only the US Constitution,
146.495	but of constitutional thought
146.495	more globally,
148.984	and, to give him his due,
151.037	he knew it.
153.145	In a period of time of just three years,
156.263	from 1785 to 1788,
158.645	he had conceived, theorized,
158.645	designed, passed and gotten ratified
165.068	the US Constitution.
166.633	And just to give you
166.633	some sense of the enormity
168.894	of what that accomplishment actually was,
170.99	although Madison
170.99	couldn't have known it at the time,
173.909	today that same constitutional technology
173.909	that he invented is still in use
179.244	not only in the US,
180.949	but, 230 years later,
182.457	in places like Canada,
184.824	India,
186.668	South Africa,
188.215	Brazil.
189.837	So in an extraordinary range
189.837	of contexts all over the world,
192.741	this technology is still the dominant,
194.845	most used, most effective technology
194.845	to manage governance.
199.816	In that moment,
201.781	Madison believed that,
201.781	having solved this problem,
205.377	the country would run smoothly,
207.016	and that he had designed a technology
208.848	that would minimize
208.848	the results of factions
211.918	so there would be no political parties.
214.114	Remarkably, he thought
214.114	he had designed a constitution
216.647	that was against political parties
218.37	and would make them unnecessary.
220.32	He had gotten an enormous degree of help
222.25	in the final marketing phase
222.25	of his constitutional project
226.117	from a man you may have heard of,
226.117	called Alexander Hamilton.
230.313	Now, Hamilton was everything
230.313	Madison was not.
234.134	He was passionate,
234.134	where Madison was restrained.
238.549	He was pansexual,
240.421	where Madison didn't speak
240.421	to a woman expect for once
243.285	until he was 42 years old,
244.899	and then married Dolley
244.899	and lived happily ever after for 40 years.
248.576	(Laughter)
250.203	To put it bluntly,
251.387	Hamilton's the kind of person
252.818	about whom you would write
252.818	a hip-hop musical --
255.071	(Laughter)
256.122	and Madison is the kind of person
257.734	about whom you would not write
257.734	a hip-hop musical.
260.163	(Laughter)
261.207	Or indeed, a musical of any kind at all.
264.192	But together,
265.385	they had become a rather unlikely pairing,
267.481	and they had produced
267.481	the Federalist Papers,
269.554	which offered a justification
271.65	and, as I mentioned,
272.839	a marketing plan for the Constitution,
275.099	which had been wildly effective
275.099	and wildly successful.
280.349	Once the new government was in place,
282.143	Hamilton became Secretary of the Treasury,
284.314	and he had a very specific idea in mind.
287.028	And that was
288.205	to do for financial institutions
288.205	and infrastructure
291.2	exactly what Madison had done
291.2	for constitutions.
295.485	Again, his contemporaries all knew it.
297.688	One of them told Madison,
299.546	who can't have liked it very much,
301.323	that Hamilton was the Newton
301.323	of infrastructure.
305.214	The idea was pretty straightforward.
307.395	Hamilton would give
307.395	the United States a national bank,
310.79	a permanent national debt --
314.22	he said it would be
314.22	"""immortal,"" his phrase --"
317.487	and a manufacturing policy
317.487	that would enable trade and manufacturing
323.09	rather than agriculture,
324.672	which was where the country's primary
324.672	wealth had historically been.
329.278	Madison went utterly ballistic.
332.424	And in this pivotal, critical decision,
335.479	instead of just telling the world
335.479	that his old friend Hamilton was wrong
339.75	and was adopting the wrong policies,
342.473	he actually began to argue
344.259	that Hamilton's ideas
344.259	were unconstitutional --
347.384	that they violated the very nature
347.384	of the Constitution
350.378	that the two of them had drafted together.
354.137	Hamilton responded
354.137	the way you would expect.
358.014	He declared Madison to be
358.014	"his ""personal and political enemy"" --"
363.099	these are his words.
364.668	So these two founders who had been
364.668	such close friends and such close allies
368.651	and such partners,
369.917	then began to produce enmity.
373.602	And they did it in the good,
373.602	old-fashioned way.
375.874	First, they founded political parties.
377.744	Madison created a party originally called
377.744	the Democratic Republican Party --
381.352	"""Republican"" for short --"
382.586	and Hamilton created a party
382.586	called the Federalist Party.
386.313	Those two parties adopted
386.313	positions on national politics
389.984	that were extreme and exaggerated.
392.725	To give you a clear example:
394.483	Madison, who had always believed
396.055	that the country would have
396.055	some manufacturing and some trade
399.168	and some agriculture,
400.762	began attacking Hamilton
402.994	as a kind of tool of the financial markets
407.192	whom Hamilton himself intended
407.192	to put in charge of the country.
412.53	That was an overstatement,
413.844	but it was something
413.844	Madison came to believe.
415.988	He also attacked city life,
417.881	and he said that the coasts were corrupt,
420.71	and what people needed to do
420.71	was to look inwards
423.365	to the center of the country,
425.102	to farmers, who were the essence
425.102	of Republican virtue,
428.939	and they should go back to the values
428.939	that had made American great,
432.815	specifically the values of the Revolution,
435.657	and those were the values of low taxes,
438.182	agriculture
439.367	and less trade.
441.231	Hamilton responded to this
441.231	by saying that Madison was na√Øve,
445.932	that he was childish,
448.1	and that his goal was
448.1	to turn the United States
450.565	into a primitive autarchy,
452.384	self-reliant and completely ineffectual
452.384	on the global scale.
456.243	(Laughter)
457.778	They both meant it,
459.507	and there was some truth
459.507	to each of their claims,
461.886	because each side was grossly exaggerating
461.886	the views of the other
466.252	in order to fight their war.
468.722	They founded newspapers,
470.879	and so for the first time in US history,
472.848	the news that people received
472.848	came entirely through the lens
477.832	of either the Republican
477.832	or the Federalist party.
482.879	How does this end?
485.071	Well, as it turned out,
485.071	the Constitution did its work.
489.759	But it did its work in surprising ways
492.843	that Madison himself
492.843	had not fully anticipated.
498.647	First, there was a series of elections.
501.058	And the first two times out of the box,
503.673	the Federalists destroyed the Republicans.
508.68	Madison was astonished.
511.798	Of course, he blamed the press.
513.502	(Laughter)
515.864	And in a rather innovative view --
518.187	Madison never failed to innovate
518.187	when he thought about anything --
521.397	he said the reason
521.397	that the press was so pro-Federalist
524.086	is that the advertisers
524.086	were all Federalists,
527.485	because they were traders on the coasts
527.485	who got their capital from Britain,
532.236	which Federalism was in bed with.
535.616	That was his initial explanation.
538.052	But despite the fact that the Federalists,
540.124	once in power,
541.299	actually enacted laws that criminalized
541.299	criticism of the government --
546.548	that happened in the United States --
549.566	nevertheless,
551.355	the Republicans fought back,
553.066	and Madison began to emphasize
553.066	the freedom of speech,
556.393	which he had built
556.393	into the Bill of Rights,
558.905	and the capacity of civil society
561.064	to organize.
562.454	And sure enough, nationally,
565.1	small local groups -- they were called
565.1	Democratic-Republican Societies --
569.487	began to form and protest
569.487	against Federalist-dominated hegemony.
574.956	Eventually, the Republicans managed
574.956	to win a national election --
580.217	that was in 1800.
582.405	Madison became the Secretary of State,
584.649	his friend and mentor Jefferson
584.649	became president,
587.363	and they actually, over time,
589.609	managed to put the Federalists
589.609	completely out of business.
594.485	That was their goal.
597.646	Now, why did that happen?
600.488	It happened because in the structure
600.488	of the Constitution
604.333	were several features
604.333	that actually managed faction
608.117	the way there were supposed to do
608.117	in the first place.
610.671	What were those?
612.335	One -- most important of all --
614.635	the freedom of speech.
616.473	This was an innovative idea at the time.
618.654	Namely, that if you were out of power,
620.937	you could still say
620.937	that the government was terrible.
624.78	Two,
626.71	civil society organization.
628.871	The capacity to put together
628.871	private groups, individuals,
633.009	political parties and others
634.64	who would organize to try to bring
634.64	about fundamental change.
639.753	Perhaps most significantly
639.753	was the separation of powers --
643.974	an extraordinary component
643.974	of the Constitution.
646.959	The thing about the separation of powers
648.931	is that it did then and it does now,
651.429	drive governance to the center.
655.946	You can get elected to office
655.946	in the United States
659.282	with help from the periphery,
661.274	right or left.
663.296	It turns out,
664.58	you actually can't govern
664.58	unless you bring on board the center.
670.8	There are midterm elections
670.8	that come incredibly fast
674.542	after a presidency begins.
677.597	Those drive presidents towards the center.
680.988	There's a structure in which
680.988	the president, in fact, does not rule
685.317	or even govern,
686.752	but can only propose laws
686.752	which other people have to agree with --
691.392	another feature that tends
691.392	to drive presidents
693.998	who actually want to get things done
695.78	to the center.
697.373	And a glance at the newspapers today
697.373	will reveal to you
701.629	that these principles are still
701.629	completely in operation.
706.171	No matter how a president gets elected,
708.325	the president cannot get anything done
711.825	unless the president first of all
711.825	follows the rules of the Constitution,
715.535	because if not,
716.715	the courts will stand up,
716.715	as indeed has sometimes occurred,
720.036	not only recently,
720.036	but in the past, in US history.
722.92	And furthermore,
724.097	the president needs people,
725.691	elected officials who know
725.691	they need to win election
728.787	from centrist voters,
730.256	also to back his or her policies
730.256	in order to pass laws.
735.382	Without it, nothing much happens.
739.685	The takeaway of this brief excursus
743.281	into the history of partisanship,
743.281	then, is the following:
749.318	partisanship is real;
751.868	it's profound;
753.829	it's extraordinarily powerful,
756.285	and it's terribly upsetting.
759.315	But the design of the Constitution
759.315	is greater than partisanship.
766.098	It enables us to manage partisanship
766.098	when that's possible,
770.555	and it enables us actually
770.555	to overcome partisan division
776.555	and produce compromise,
778.227	when and only when that is possible.
782.903	A technology like that
782.903	is a technology that worked
786.429	for the founders,
788.17	it worked for their grandchildren,
791.904	it didn't work at the moment
791.904	of the Civil War,
794.136	but then it started working again.
796.485	And it worked for our grandparents,
798.81	our parents,
800.388	and it's going to work for us.
805.288	(Applause)
810.545	So what you should do is really simple.
813.589	Stand up for what you believe in,
816.207	support the organizations
816.207	that you care about,
819.437	speak out on the issues
819.437	that matter to you,
823.245	get involved,
825.1	make change,
826.639	express you opinion,
828.558	and do it with respect
828.558	and knowledge and confidence
832.433	that it's only by working together
835.311	that the constitutional technology
835.311	can do the job that it is designed to do.
840.817	Stand up for what you believe,
842.534	but take a deep breath while you do it.
845.178	It's going to be OK.
848.887	Thanks.
850.27	(Applause)
