25	As you pointed out, every time you come here, you learn something.
29	This morning, the world's experts
31	from I guess three or four different companies on building seats,
35	I think concluded that ultimately, the solution is, people shouldn't sit down.
40	I could have told them that.
42	(Laughter)
44	Yesterday, the automotive guys gave us some new insights.
50	They pointed out that, I believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today,
56	they will be steering cars by wire,
59	without all that mechanical stuff.
61	(Laughter)
63	That's reassuring.
65	(Applause)
69	They then pointed out that there'd be, sort of, the other controls by wire,
74	to get rid of all that mechanical stuff.
76	That's pretty good, but why not get rid of the wires?
81	Then you don't need anything to control the car, except thinking about it.
89	I would love to talk about the technology,
91	and sometime, in what's past the 15 minutes,
95	I'll be happy to talk to all the techno-geeks around here
97	about what's in here.
101	But if I had one thing to say about this, before we get to first,
105	it would be that from the time we started building this,
111	the big idea wasn't the technology.
113	It really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it
116	in the iBOT for the disabled community.
118	The big idea here is, I think, a new piece of a solution
124	to a fairly big problem in transportation.
128	And maybe to put that in perspective: there's so much data on this,
133	I'll be happy to give it to you in different forms.
135	You never know what strikes the fancy of whom,
138	but everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world.
143	And Henry Ford, just about 100 years ago, started cranking out Model Ts.
147	What I don't think most people think about
149	is the context of how technology is applied.
153	For instance, in that time, 91 percent of America
156	lived either on farms or in small towns.
159	So, the car --
162	the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage -- was a big deal;
166	it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage.
168	It was half as long.
170	And it was an environmental improvement, because, for instance,
174	in 1903 they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown Manhattan,
179	because you can imagine what the roads look like
182	when you have a million horses,
185	and a million of them urinating and doing other things,
189	and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable.
195	So the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy.
199	It also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm,
203	or their farm to a town, or from a town to a city.
206	It all made sense, with 91 percent of the people living there.
211	By the 1950s, we started connecting all the towns together
215	with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world, the highway system.
219	And it is certainly a wonder.
222	And by the way, as I take shots at old technologies,
226	I want to assure everybody, and particularly the automotive industry --
230	who's been very supportive of us --
232	that I don't think this in any way competes with airplanes, or cars.
240	But think about where the world is today.
247	That's 3.2 billion people.
251	We've solved all the transportation problems
253	that have changed the world to get it to where we are today.
259	we found a new continent.
265	that we turned the continent into a country.
268	Over the last hundred years, we started building cars,
271	and then over the 50 years we've connected every city to every other city
274	in an extraordinarily efficient way,
276	and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that.
279	But during that entire process, more and more people have been born,
284	and more and more people are moving to cities.
286	China alone is going to move four to six hundred million people
290	into cities in the next decade and a half.
294	And so, nobody, I think, would argue that airplanes, in the last 50 years,
300	have turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood.
304	And if you just look at how technology has been applied,
306	we've solved all the long-range, high-speed, high-volume,
310	large-weight problems of moving things around.
313	Nobody would want to give them up.
315	And I certainly wouldn't want to give up my airplane,
318	or my helicopter, or my Humvee, or my Porsche.
322	I love them all. I don't keep any of them in my living room.
325	The fact is, the last mile is the problem,
330	and half the world now lives in dense cities.
333	And people spend, depending on who they are,
335	between 90 and 95 percent of their energy getting around on foot.
340	I think there's -- I don't know what data would impress you,
343	but how about, 43 percent of the refined fuel produced in the world
349	is consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the United States.
355	Three million people die every year in cities due to bad air,
360	and almost all particulate pollution on this planet
363	is produced by transportation devices, particularly sitting in cities.
368	And again, I say that not to attack any industry,
372	I think -- I really do -- I love my airplane,
375	and cars on highways moving 60 miles an hour
378	are extraordinarily efficient,
380	both from an engineering point of view,
383	an energy consumption point of view, and a utility point of view.
386	And we all love our cars, and I do.
389	The problem is, you get into the city and you want to go four blocks,
393	it's neither fun nor efficient nor productive.
396	It's not sustainable.
398	If -- in China, in the year 1998, 417 million people used bicycles;
404	1.7 million people used cars.
408	If five percent of that population became, quote, middle class,
412	and wanted to go the way we've gone in the last hundred years
417	at the same time that 50 percent of their population are moving into cities
420	of the size and density of Manhattan, every six weeks --
424	it isn't sustainable environmentally;
426	it isn't sustainable economically -- there just ain't enough oil --
430	and it's not sustainable politically.
432	I mean, what are we fighting over right now?
434	We can make it complicated, but what's the world fighting over right now?
438	So it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile,
445	and it was dumb luck. We were working on iBOTs,
448	but once we made this, we instantly decided
450	it could be a great alternative to jet skis. You don't need the water.
454	Or snowmobiles. You don't need the snow.
456	Or skiing. It's just fun, and people love to move around doing fun things.
463	And every one of those industries, by the way --
465	just golf carts alone is a multi-billion-dollar industry.
468	But rather than go license this off, which is what we normally do,
471	it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology,
475	but into an understanding of a world that's solved all its other problems,
479	but has somehow come to accept that cities -- which,
484	right back from ancient Greece on, were meant to walk around,
487	cities that were architected and built for people --
490	now have a footprint that,
492	while we've solved every other transportation problem --
494	and it's like Moore's law.
496	I mean, look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Conestoga wagon,
501	then on a railroad, then an airplane.
504	Every other form of transportation's been improved.
508	In 5,000 years, we've gone backwards in getting around cities.
512	They've gotten bigger; they're spread out.
515	The most expensive real estate on this planet in every city --
520	Wilshire Boulevard, or Fifth Avenue, or Tokyo, or Paris --
524	the most expensive real estate is their downtowns.
531	The 20 largest cities in the world.
533	So you wonder, what if cities could give to their pedestrians
538	what we take for granted as we now go between cities?
542	What if you could make them fun, attractive, clean,
546	environmentally friendly?
550	What if it would make it a little bit more palatable
553	to have access via this, as that last link to mass transit,
559	to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs
562	and use our cars the way we want,
564	and then have our cities energized again?
569	We thought it would be really neat to do that,
571	and one of the problems we really were worried about
573	is: how do we get legal on the sidewalk?
576	Because technically I've got motors; I've got wheels -- I'm a motor vehicle.
580	I don't look like a motor vehicle.
582	I have the same footprint as a pedestrian;
584	I have the same unique capability
588	to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space.
590	I took this down to Ground Zero,
592	and knocked my way through crowds for an hour.
595	I'm a pedestrian. But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two,
600	and if we get told we don't belong on the sidewalk, we have two choices.
606	We're a recreational vehicle that doesn't really matter,
608	and I don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff.
613	Or maybe we should be out in the street
615	in front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle.
619	We've been so concerned about that,
621	we went to the Postmaster General of the United States,
623	as the first person we ever showed on the outside,
626	"and said, ""Put your people on it. Everybody trusts their postman."
630	"And they belong on the sidewalks, and they'll use it seriously."""
635	He agreed. We went to a number of police departments
638	that want their police officers back in the neighborhood
640	on the beat, carrying 70 pounds of stuff. They love it.
644	And I can't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket.
648	(Laughter)
651	So we've been working really, really hard,
653	but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop
656	as an attitude about what's important, and how to apply the technology.
661	We went out and we found some visionary people
664	with enough money to let us design and build these things,
669	and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted.
673	So, I'm happy, really, I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want.
678	And yes, it's really fun, and yes, you should all go out and try it.
682	But if I could ask you to do one thing,
684	it's not to think about it as a piece of technology,
686	but just imagine that, although we all understand somehow
690	that it's reasonable that we use our 4,000-pound machine,
694	which can go 60 miles an hour,
696	that can bring you everywhere you want to go,
698	and somehow it's also what we used for the last mile,
704	and it's broken, and it doesn't work.
707	One of the more exciting things that occurred to us
710	about why it might get accepted, happened out here in California.
715	A few weeks ago, after we launched it,
717	we were here with a news crew on Venice Beach, zipping up and back,
722	and he's marveling at the technology,
724	and meanwhile bicycles are zipping by,
726	and skateboarders are zipping by,
728	and a little old lady -- I mean, if you looked in the dictionary,
732	a little old lady -- came by me --
735	and now that I'm on this, I'm the height of a normal adult now --
739	and she just stops, and the camera is there, and she looks up at me
745	"and says, ""Can I try that?"""
748	And what was I -- you know, how are you going to say anything?
751	"And so I said, ""Sure."""
753	So I get off, and she gets on, and with a little bit of the usual, ah,
759	then she turns around, and she goes about 20 feet,
764	and she turns back around, and she's all smiles.
767	And she comes back to me and she stops, and she says,
773	"""Finally, they made something for us."""
777	And the camera is looking down at her.
779	"I'm thinking, ""Wow, that was great --"
781	(Laughter)
782	"-- please lady, don't say another word."""
784	(Laughter)
787	And the camera is down at her,
789	and this guy has to put the microphone in her face,
791	"said, ""What do you mean by that?"""
793	"And I figured, ""It's all over now,"""
795	"and she looks up and she says, ""Well,"""
799	"she's still watching these guys go; she says, ""I can't ride a bike,"" no,"
802	"she says, ""I can't use a skateboard, and I've never used roller blades,"""
806	she knew them by name;
808	"she says, ""And it's been 50 years since I rode a bicycle."""
811	Then she looks up, she's looking up, and she says,
815	"""And I'm 81 years old, and I don't drive a car anymore."
819	"I still have to get to the store, and I can't carry a lot of things."""
823	And it suddenly occurred to me, that among my many fears,
827	were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators
830	and the legislators might not get it --
833	it was that, fundamentally, you believe there's pressure among the people
838	not to invade the most precious little bit of space left,
841	the sidewalks in these cities.
843	When you look at the 36 inches of legal requirement for sidewalk,
847	then the eight foot for the parked car, then the three lanes,
850	and then the other eight feet -- it's --
852	that little piece is all that's there.
856	But she looks up and says this,
858	and it occurs to me, well, kids aren't going to mind these things,
860	and they don't vote, and business people and then young adults
864	aren't going to mind these things -- they're pretty cool --
866	so I guess subliminally I was worried
868	that it's the older population that's going to worry.
871	So, having seen this, and having worried about it for eight years,
876	the first thing I do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys,
880	call AARP, get an appointment right away.
883	We've got to show them this thing.
885	And they took it to Washington; they showed them;
888	and they're going to be involved now,
890	watching how these things get absorbed in a number of cities,
894	like Atlanta, where we're doing trials to see if it really can, in fact,
898	help re-energize their downtown.
901	(Applause)
908	The bottom line is, whether you believe the United Nations,
913	or any of the other think tanks --
915	in the next 20 years, all human population growth on this planet
919	will be in cities.
921	In Asia alone, it will be over a billion people.
924	They learned to start with cell phones.
928	They didn't have to take the 100-year trip we took.
931	They start at the top of the technology food chain.
934	We've got to start building cities and human environments
937	where a 150-pound person can go a couple of miles
940	in a dense, rich, green-space environment,
943	without being in a 4,000-pound machine to do it.
947	Cars were not meant for parallel parking;
950	they're wonderful machines to go between cities, but just think about it:
954	we've solved all the long-range, high-speed problems.
959	The Greeks went from the theater of Dionysus to the Parthenon in their sandals.
964	You do it in your sneakers.
966	Not much has changed.
968	If this thing goes only three times as fast as walking -- three times --
973	a 30-minute walk becomes 10 minutes.
975	Your choice, when living in a city, if it's now 10 minutes --
980	because at 30 minutes you want an alternative, whether it's a bus, a train --
984	we've got to build an infrastructure -- a light rail --
986	or you're going to keep parking those cars.
988	But if you could put a pin in most cities,
991	and imagine how far you could, if you had the time, walk in one half-hour, it's the city.
997	If you could make it fun, and make it eight or 10 minutes,
999	you can't find your car, un-park your car, move your car,
1002	re-park your car and go somewhere;
1004	you can't get to a cab or a subway.
1007	We could change the way people allocate their resources,
1010	the way this planet uses its energy,
1013	make it more fun.
1015	And we're hoping to some extent history will say we were right.
1020	That's Segway. This is a Stirling cycle engine;
1023	this had been confused by a lot of things we're doing.
1027	This little beast, right now, is producing a few hundred watts of electricity.
1032	Yes, it could be attached to this,
1034	and yes, on a kilogram of propane,
1037	you could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose.
1042	Perhaps more interesting about this little engine is it'll burn any fuel,
1046	because some of you might be skeptical
1048	about the capability of this to have an impact,
1052	where most of the world you can't simply plug into your 120-volt outlet.
1056	We've been working on this,
1058	actually, as an alternative energy source,
1060	starting way back with Johnson &amp; Johnson, to run an iBOT,
1062	because the best batteries you could get --
1075	8,750 watt-hours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline --
1080	which is why nobody drives electric cars.
1082	But, in any event, if you can burn it with the same efficiency --
1088	because it's external combustion -- as your kitchen stove,
1091	if you can burn any fuel, it turns out to be pretty neat.
1094	It makes just enough electricity to, for instance, do this,
1097	which at night is enough electricity, in the rest of the world,
1100	as Mr. Holly -- Dr. Holly -- pointed out,
1103	can run computers and a light bulb.
1106	But more interestingly, the thermodynamics of this say,
1110	you're never going to get more than 20 percent efficiency.
1113	It doesn't matter much -- it says if you get 200 watts of electricity,
1116	you'll get 700 or 800 watts of heat.
1119	If you wanted to boil water and re-condense it at a rate of 10 gallons an hour,
1124	it takes about 25, a little over 25.3 kilowatt --
1131	That's so much energy, you couldn't afford to desalinate
1133	or clean water in this country that way.
1135	Certainly, in the rest of the world, your choice is to devastate the place,
1139	turning everything that will burn into heat, or drink the water that's available.
1144	The number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water.
1148	Depending on whose numbers you believe,
1150	it's between 60 and 85,000 people per day.
1153	We don't need sophisticated heart transplants around the world.
1156	We need water.
1158	And women shouldn't have to spend four hours a day looking for it,
1161	or watching their kids die.
1163	We figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing,
1166	with a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat,
1169	then using a little bit of the electricity control that process,
1173	and for 450 watts, which is a little more than half of its waste heat,
1179	it will make 10 gallons an hour of distilled water
1181	from anything that comes into it to cool it.
1183	So if we put this box on here in a few years,
1186	could we have a solution to transportation, electricity,
1192	and communication, and maybe drinkable water
1196	in a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds?
1200	I don't know, but we'll try it.
1202	I better shut up.
1204	(Applause)
