12.704	I'm going to be talking
12.704	about statistics today.
15.491	If that makes you immediately feel
15.491	a little bit wary, that's OK,
18.653	that doesn't make you some
18.653	kind of crazy conspiracy theorist,
21.536	it makes you skeptical.
22.856	And when it comes to numbers,
22.856	especially now, you should be skeptical.
26.766	But you should also be able to tell
26.766	which numbers are reliable
29.801	and which ones aren't.
30.985	So today I want to try to give you
30.985	some tools to be able to do that.
34.215	But before I do,
35.408	I just want to clarify which numbers
35.408	I'm talking about here.
38.271	I'm not talking about claims like,
39.93	"""9 out of 10 women recommend"
39.93	"this anti-aging cream."""
42.403	I think a lot of us always
42.403	roll our eyes at numbers like that.
45.399	What's different now is people
45.399	are questioning statistics like,
48.407	"""The US unemployment"
48.407	"rate is five percent."""
50.445	What makes this claim different is
50.445	it doesn't come from a private company,
53.985	it comes from the government.
55.397	About 4 out of 10 Americans
55.397	distrust the economic data
58.757	that gets reported by government.
60.354	Among supporters of President Trump
60.354	it's even higher;
62.869	it's about 7 out of 10.
64.526	I don't need to tell anyone here
66.354	that there are a lot of dividing lines
66.354	in our society right now,
69.389	and a lot of them start to make sense,
71.238	once you understand people's relationships
71.238	with these government numbers.
74.949	On the one hand, there are those who say
74.949	these statistics are crucial,
78.309	that we need them to make sense
78.309	of society as a whole
80.963	in order to move beyond
80.963	emotional anecdotes
83.151	and measure progress
83.151	in an [objective] way.
85.585	And then there are the others,
87.076	who say that these statistics are elitist,
89.256	maybe even rigged;
90.488	they don't make sense
90.488	and they don't really reflect
92.906	what's happening
92.906	in people's everyday lives.
95.226	It kind of feels like that second group
95.226	is winning the argument right now.
98.737	We're living in a world
98.737	of alternative facts,
100.869	where people don't find statistics
100.869	this kind of common ground,
103.828	this starting point for debate.
105.488	This is a problem.
106.798	There are actually
106.798	moves in the US right now
108.889	to get rid of some government
108.889	statistics altogether.
111.774	Right now there's a bill in congress
111.774	about measuring racial inequality.
115.185	The draft law says that government
115.185	money should not be used
118.01	to collect data on racial segregation.
119.936	This is a total disaster.
121.845	If we don't have this data,
123.617	how can we observe discrimination,
125.419	let alone fix it?
126.721	In other words:
127.933	How can a government create fair policies
130.016	if they can't measure
130.016	current levels of unfairness?
132.811	This isn't just about discrimination,
134.629	it's everything -- think about it.
136.323	How can we legislate on health care
138.037	if we don't have good data
138.037	on health or poverty?
140.332	How can we have public debate
140.332	about immigration
142.554	if we can't at least agree
143.828	on how many people are entering
143.828	and leaving the country?
146.495	Statistics come from the state;
146.495	that's where they got their name.
149.577	The point was to better
149.577	measure the population
151.758	in order to better serve it.
153.139	So we need these government numbers,
154.888	but we also have to move
154.888	beyond either blindly accepting
157.559	or blindly rejecting them.
158.851	We need to learn the skills
158.851	to be able to spot bad statistics.
161.872	I started to learn some of these
163.424	when I was working
163.424	in a statistical department
165.614	that's part of the United Nations.
167.281	Our job was to find out how many Iraqis
167.281	had been forced from their homes
170.711	as a result of the war,
171.893	and what they needed.
173.075	It was really important work,
173.075	but it was also incredibly difficult.
176.277	Every single day, we were making decisions
178.319	that affected the accuracy
178.319	of our numbers --
180.5	decisions like which parts
180.5	of the country we should go to,
183.268	who we should speak to,
184.448	which questions we should ask.
186.04	And I started to feel
186.04	really disillusioned with our work,
188.744	because we thought we were doing
188.744	a really good job,
191.286	but the one group of people
191.286	who could really tell us were the Iraqis,
194.588	and they rarely got the chance to find
194.588	our analysis, let alone question it.
198.152	So I started to feel really determined
200.007	that the one way to make
200.007	numbers more accurate
202.342	is to have as many people as possible
202.342	be able to question them.
205.419	So I became a data journalist.
206.877	My job is finding these data sets
206.877	and sharing them with the public.
210.805	Anyone can do this,
210.805	you don't have to be a geek or a nerd.
214.002	You can ignore those words;
214.002	they're used by people
216.381	trying to say they're smart
216.381	while pretending they're humble.
219.227	Absolutely anyone can do this.
220.84	I want to give you guys three questions
222.931	that will help you be able to spot
222.931	some bad statistics.
225.96	So, question number one
225.96	is: Can you see uncertainty?
229.491	One of things that's really changed
229.491	people's relationship with numbers,
232.879	and even their trust in the media,
234.544	has been the use of political polls.
236.826	I personally have a lot of issues
236.826	with political polls
239.388	because I think the role of journalists
239.388	is actually to report the facts
242.788	and not attempt to predict them,
244.365	especially when those predictions
244.365	can actually damage democracy
247.385	by signaling to people:
247.385	don't bother to vote for that guy,
250.141	he doesn't have a chance.
251.37	Let's set that aside for now and talk
251.37	about the accuracy of this endeavor.
255.048	Based on national elections
255.048	in the UK, Italy, Israel
259.68	and of course, the most recent
259.68	US presidential election,
262.468	using polls to predict electoral outcomes
264.629	is about as accurate as using the moon
264.629	to predict hospital admissions.
268.465	No, seriously, I used actual data
268.465	from an academic study to draw this.
272.689	There are a lot of reasons why
272.689	polling has become so inaccurate.
276.44	Our societies have become really diverse,
278.434	which makes it difficult for pollsters
278.434	to get a really nice representative sample
282.279	of the population for their polls.
283.93	People are really reluctant to answer
283.93	their phones to pollsters,
286.96	and also, shockingly enough,
286.96	people might lie.
289.26	But you wouldn't necessarily
289.26	know that to look at the media.
292.095	For one thing, the probability
292.095	of a Hillary Clinton win
294.88	was communicated with decimal places.
297.695	We don't use decimal places
297.695	to describe the temperature.
300.34	How on earth can predicting the behavior
300.34	of 230 million voters in this country
304.592	be that precise?
306.445	And then there were those sleek charts.
308.471	See, a lot of data visualizations
308.471	will overstate certainty, and it works --
312.468	these charts can numb
312.468	our brains to criticism.
315.112	When you hear a statistic,
315.112	you might feel skeptical.
317.694	As soon as it's buried in a chart,
319.353	it feels like some kind
319.353	of objective science,
321.506	and it's not.
322.779	So I was trying to find ways
322.779	to better communicate this to people,
325.906	to show people the uncertainty
325.906	in our numbers.
328.434	What I did was I started taking
328.434	real data sets,
330.704	and turning them into
330.704	hand-drawn visualizations,
333.38	so that people can see
333.38	how imprecise the data is;
336.076	so people can see that a human did this,
338.096	a human found the data and visualized it.
340.092	For example, instead
340.092	of finding out the probability
342.788	of getting the flu in any given month,
344.938	you can see the rough
344.938	distribution of flu season.
347.754	This is --
348.945	(Laughter)
349.987	a bad shot to show in February.
351.497	But it's also more responsible
351.497	data visualization,
353.976	because if you were to show
353.976	the exact probabilities,
356.455	maybe that would encourage
356.455	people to get their flu jabs
359.071	at the wrong time.
360.983	The point of these shaky lines
362.7	is so that people remember
362.7	these imprecisions,
365.635	but also so they don't necessarily
365.635	walk away with a specific number,
368.886	but they can remember important facts.
370.776	Facts like injustice and inequality
370.776	leave a huge mark on our lives.
374.824	Facts like Black Americans and Native
374.824	Americans have shorter life expectancies
379.037	than those of other races,
380.461	and that isn't changing anytime soon.
382.623	Facts like prisoners in the US
382.623	can be kept in solitary confinement cells
386.548	that are smaller than the size
386.548	of an average parking space.
390.355	The point of these visualizations
390.355	is also to remind people
393.714	of some really important
393.714	statistical concepts,
396.088	concepts like averages.
397.748	So let's say you hear a claim like,
399.44	"""The average swimming pool in the US"
399.44	"contains 6.23 fecal accidents."""
403.898	That doesn't mean every single
403.898	swimming pool in the country
406.719	contains exactly 6.23 turds.
408.937	So in order to show that,
410.378	I went back to the original data,
410.378	which comes from the CDC,
413.243	who surveyed 47 swimming facilities.
415.332	And I just spent one evening
415.332	redistributing poop.
417.747	So you can kind of see
417.747	how misleading averages can be.
420.453	(Laughter)
421.759	OK, so the second question
421.759	that you guys should be asking yourselves
425.684	to spot bad numbers is:
427.209	Can I see myself in the data?
429.2	This question is also
429.2	about averages in a way,
432.137	because part of the reason
432.137	why people are so frustrated
434.766	with these national statistics,
436.285	is they don't really tell the story
436.285	of who's winning and who's losing
439.582	from national policy.
440.762	It's easy to understand why people
440.762	are frustrated with global averages
444.104	when they don't match up
444.104	with their personal experiences.
446.807	I wanted to show people the way
446.807	data relates to their everyday lives.
450.094	I started this advice column
450.094	"called ""Dear Mona,"""
452.364	where people would write to me
452.364	with questions and concerns
455.114	and I'd try to answer them with data.
456.922	People asked me anything.
458.146	"questions like, ""Is it normal to sleep"
458.146	"in a separate bed to my wife?"""
461.431	"""Do people regret their tattoos?"""
463.046	"""What does it mean to die"
463.046	"of natural causes?"""
465.234	All of these questions are great,
465.234	because they make you think
468.224	about ways to find
468.224	and communicate these numbers.
470.584	If someone asks you,
470.584	"""How much pee is a lot of pee?"""
473.111	which is a question that I got asked,
475.593	you really want to make sure
475.593	that the visualization makes sense
478.597	to as many people as possible.
480.368	These numbers aren't unavailable.
481.967	Sometimes they're just buried
481.967	in the appendix of an academic study.
485.498	And they're certainly not inscrutable;
487.361	if you really wanted to test
487.361	these numbers on urination volume,
490.36	you could grab a bottle
490.36	and try it for yourself.
492.641	(Laughter)
493.673	The point of this isn't necessarily
495.391	that every single data set
495.391	has to relate specifically to you.
498.292	I'm interested in how many women
498.292	were issued fines in France
501.196	for wearing the face veil, or the niqab,
503.179	even if I don't live in France
503.179	or wear the face veil.
505.821	The point of asking where you fit in
505.821	is to get as much context as possible.
509.68	So it's about zooming out
509.68	from one data point,
511.895	like the unemployment rate
511.895	is five percent,
514.023	and seeing how it changes over time,
515.804	or seeing how it changes
515.804	by educational status --
518.478	this is why your parents always
518.478	wanted you to go to college --
521.606	or seeing how it varies by gender.
523.662	Nowadays, male unemployment rate is higher
525.813	than the female unemployment rate.
527.537	Up until the early '80s,
527.537	it was the other way around.
530.256	This is a story of one
530.256	of the biggest changes
532.397	that's happened in American society,
534.141	and it's all there in that chart,
534.141	once you look beyond the averages.
537.441	The axes are everything;
538.63	once you change the scale,
538.63	you can change the story.
541.323	OK, so the third and final question
541.323	that I want you guys to think about
544.727	when you're looking at statistics is:
546.57	How was the data collected?
549.487	So far, I've only talked about the way
549.487	data is communicated,
552.45	but the way it's collected
552.45	matters just as much.
554.75	I know this is tough,
555.941	because methodologies can be opaque
555.941	and actually kind of boring,
559.046	but there are some simple steps
559.046	you can take to check this.
561.943	I'll use one last example here.
564.129	One poll found that 41 percent of Muslims
564.129	in this country support jihad,
568.04	which is obviously pretty scary,
569.589	and it was reported everywhere in 2015.
572.255	When I want to check a number like that,
574.894	I'll start off by finding
574.894	the original questionnaire.
577.419	It turns out that journalists
577.419	who reported on that statistic
580.369	ignored a question
580.369	lower down on the survey
582.624	that asked respondents
582.624	"how they defined ""jihad."""
584.994	And most of them defined it as,
586.999	"""Muslims' personal, peaceful struggle"
586.999	"to be more religious."""
590.965	Only 16 percent defined it as,
590.965	"""violent holy war against unbelievers."""
595.183	This is the really important point:
597.637	based on those numbers,
597.637	it's totally possible
599.816	that no one in the survey
599.816	who defined it as violent holy war
602.945	also said they support it.
604.301	Those two groups might not overlap at all.
606.942	It's also worth asking
606.942	how the survey was carried out.
609.603	This was something called an opt-in poll,
611.625	which means anyone could have found it
611.625	on the internet and completed it.
615.051	There's no way of knowing
615.051	if those people even identified as Muslim.
618.414	And finally, there were 600
618.414	respondents in that poll.
621.05	There are roughly three million
621.05	Muslims in this country,
623.728	according to Pew Research Center.
625.359	That means the poll spoke to roughly
625.359	one in every 5,000 Muslims
628.376	in this country.
629.568	This is one of the reasons
630.858	why government statistics
630.858	are often better than private statistics.
634.489	A poll might speak to a couple
634.489	hundred people, maybe a thousand,
637.548	or if you're L'Oreal, trying to sell
637.548	skin care products in 2005,
640.63	then you spoke to 48 women
640.63	to claim that they work.
643.071	(Laughter)
644.121	Private companies don't have a huge
644.121	interest in getting the numbers right,
647.701	they just need the right numbers.
649.48	Government statisticians aren't like that.
651.524	In theory, at least,
651.524	they're totally impartial,
653.995	not least because most of them do
653.995	their jobs regardless of who's in power.
657.52	They're civil servants.
658.706	And to do their jobs properly,
660.694	they don't just speak
660.694	to a couple hundred people.
663.081	Those unemployment numbers
663.081	I keep on referencing
665.423	come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
667.451	and to make their estimates,
668.81	they speak to over 140,000
668.81	businesses in this country.
672.323	I get it, it's frustrating.
674.072	If you want to test a statistic
674.072	that comes from a private company,
677.211	you can buy the face cream for you
677.211	and a bunch of friends, test it out,
680.596	if it doesn't work,
680.596	you can say the numbers were wrong.
683.211	But how do you question
683.211	government statistics?
685.381	You just keep checking everything.
687.035	Find out how they collected the numbers.
688.972	Find out if you're seeing everything
688.972	on the chart you need to see.
692.121	But don't give up on the numbers
692.121	altogether, because if you do,
695.11	we'll be making public policy
695.11	decisions in the dark,
697.573	using nothing but private
697.573	interests to guide us.
699.859	Thank you.
701.049	(Applause)
