12.826	Puzzles
14.642	and magic.
16.941	I work in what most people think
19.085	are two distinct fields,
21.523	but I believe they are the same.
24.594	I am both a magician and
26.57	a New York Times crossword puzzle constructor,
30.406	which basically means I've taken
31.77	the world's two nerdiest hobbies
33.392	and combined them into one career.
36.32	And I believe that magic and puzzles are the same
39.443	because they both key into one of
41.379	the most important human drives:
44.03	the urge to solve.
46.116	Human beings are wired to solve,
49.249	to make order out of chaos.
52.253	It's certainly true for me.
53.76	I've been solving my whole life.
55.599	High school consisted of epic
55.599	Scrabble matches in the cafeteria
59.903	and not really talking to girls,
61.612	and then at about that time
63.435	I started learning magic tricks
65.13	and definitely not talking to girls.
67.597	There's nothing like starting a conversation with,
69.644	"""Hey, did you know that 'prestidigitation' is worth"
75.224	But back then, I noticed an intersection
78.011	between puzzles and illusion.
80.736	When you do the crossword puzzle
82.682	or when you watch a magic show,
84.628	you become a solver,
86.88	and your goal is to try to find the order in the chaos,
90.658	the chaos of, say, a black-and-white puzzle grid,
93.898	a mixed-up bag of Scrabble tiles,
96.042	or a shuffled pack of playing cards.
98.85	And today, as a cruciverbalist —
103.45	and an illusion designer, I create that chaos.
107.207	I test your ability to solve.
110.552	Now, it turns out research tells us
112.962	that solving is as primal as eating and sleeping.
116.96	From birth, we are wired to solve.
120.695	In one UCLA study, newborns still in the hospital
124.532	were shown patterns, patterns like this:
127.22	circle, cross, circle, cross.
130.831	And then the pattern was changed: triangle, square.
135.15	And by tracking an infant's gaze,
137.806	we know that newborns as young as a day old
141.11	can notice and respond to disruptions in order.
143.722	It's remarkable.
145.14	So from infancy through old age,
147.738	the urge to solve unites us all,
150.11	and I even found this photo on Instagram
152.75	of pop star Katy Perry solving a crossword puzzle
155.904	with her morning coffee.
158.13	Like.
159.801	(Laughter)
163.669	Now, solving exists across all cultures.
168.21	The American invention is the crossword puzzle,
171.154	and this year we are celebrating
172.553	the 100th anniversary of the crossword puzzle,
175.226	first published in The New York World.
177.733	But many other cultures have
177.733	their signature puzzles as well.
180.372	China gives us tangrams,
182.382	which would test solvers' abilities
184.427	to form shapes from the jumbled pieces.
187.567	Chaos. Order.
190.57	Order.
192.628	And order.
195.823	That one's my favorite, let's hear it again.
198.393	Okay.
200.064	And how about this puzzle
201.84	invented in 18th-century England:
204.279	the jigsaw puzzle.
206.33	Is this not making order out of chaos?
210.144	So as you can see,
211.613	we are always solving.
213.392	We are always trying to decode our world.
217.354	It's an eternal quest.
218.884	It's just like the one Cervantes wrote about
221.528	"in ""Don Quixote,"""
222.979	"which by the way is the root of the word ""quixotry,"""
224.981	the highest-scoring Scrabble word of all time,
228.66	"But anyway, ""Don Quixote"" is an important book."
231.877	"You guys have read ""Don Quixote,"" yes?"
233.914	I'm seeing some heads nod.
235.42	Come on guys, really?
236.702	"Who's read ""Don Quixote?"" Let's do this."
236.702	"Raise your hands if you've read ""Don Quixote."""
239.239	There we go. Smart audience.
240.349	"Who's read ""Don Quixote?"" Get them up."
242.063	Okay, good, because I need somebody smart here
246.276	because now I'm going to demonstrate
247.478	with the help of one of you
249.35	just how deeply rooted your urge to solve is,
252.686	just how wired to solve all of you really are,
255.185	so I'm going to come into the audience
256.627	and find somebody to help me.
259.625	Let's see.
261.747	Everybody's looking away all of a sudden.
265.639	Can I? Would you? What is your name? Gwen.
269.556	I'm not a mind reader, I can see your name tag.
271.997	Come with me, Gwen. Everyone give her 
271.997	a round of applause, make her feel welcome.
276.31	Gwen, after you.
277.982	(Applause)
279.864	Are you so excited?
283.275	Did you know that your name is worth
284.73	eight points in Scrabble?
286.328	Okay, stand right here, Gwen, right here.
290.615	Now, Gwen, before we begin,
293.117	I'd like to point out a piece of the puzzle,
295.726	which is here in this envelope,
297.263	and I will not go near it. Okay?
298.883	And over here we have a
298.883	drawing of some farm animals.
300.891	You can see we have an owl, we have a horse,
302.251	a donkey, a rooster, an ox, and a sheep,
304.48	and then here, Gwen, we have
305.69	some fancy art store markers,
308.11	colors like, can you see that word right there?
310.45	Gwen: Cobalt.
310.45	David Kwong: Cobalt, yes. Cobalt.
312.789	But we have a silver, a red, an emerald,
315.407	and an amber marker,
316.865	and Gwen, you are going to color this drawing
319.13	just like you were five years old,
320.607	one marker at a time.
321.715	It's going to be a lot of fun.
323.234	But I'm going to go over here.
324.255	I don't want to see what you're doing.
326.342	Okay, so don't start yet.
327.412	Wait for me to get over here and close my eyes.
328.839	Now Gwen, are you ready?
330.717	Pick up just one marker, pick up just one marker,
334.227	and why don't you color in the horse for me?
335.612	Color in the horse — big, big, big scribbles,
339.165	broad strokes, don't worry about staying in the lines.
342.123	All right. Great.
343.399	And why don't you take that marker and recap it
344.975	and place it on the table for me.
346.905	Okay, and pick up another marker out of the cup
350.125	and take off the cap
352.575	and color in the donkey for me, color in the donkey.
354.641	Big scribbles.
357.709	Okay, cool, and re-cap that marker
359.943	and place it on the table.
361.445	And pick up another marker for me
363.723	and take off the cap. Isn't this fun?
366.186	And color in the owl for me.
367.513	Color in the owl.
370.564	Okay, and recap that marker
373.05	and pick up another marker out of the cup
374.838	and color in the rooster for me, color in the rooster.
378.414	Good, good, good, good, good.
379.838	Big, big, big strokes. Good, good.
380.931	Pick up another marker out of the cup
383.196	and color in the ox for me. Color in the ox.
386.693	Okay, good.
387.956	A lot of color on that, and recap,
387.956	and place it on the table,
390.406	and pick up another marker out of the cup.
393.11	Oh, I'm out? Okay, I'm going to turn around.
395.849	Did I forget? Oh, I forgot my purple marker.
401.109	This is still going to work, though.
402.452	I think this is still going to work, mostly.
404.735	So Gwen, I'm going to hand you this envelope.
407.888	Don't open it yet. Do not open it yet,
410.84	but I am going to write down your choices
413.231	so that everybody can see
415.39	the choices that you made.
416.663	Okay, great. So we have a cobalt horse,
425.046	amber owl,
430.452	a silver ox,
435.233	yes, okay, a red donkey,
438.675	and what was the emerald color? A rooster.
442.05	An emerald rooster. Okay.
446.12	Now for the moment of truth, Gwen,
448.286	we're going to take a look in that envelope.
449.971	Why don't you open it up and remove
451.886	the one piece of paper from inside
453.178	and hand it to me,
454.207	and we will see if it matches your choices.
458.91	Yes, I think it does.
460.345	We have a cobalt horse, we have a red donkey,
461.909	we have an amber owl, we have
461.909	an emerald rooster, a silver ox,
464.206	I forgot my purple marker so we have a blank sheep,
466.217	but that's a pretty amazing
466.217	coincidence, don't you think?
468.932	Gwen, well done. That's beautiful. (Applause)
473.113	I'll take that back from you.
474.88	So ladies and gentlemen, how is this possible?
478.744	How is this possible? Well, could it be
481.561	that Gwen's brain is so wired to solve
485.823	that she decoded hidden messages?
488.669	Well this is the puzzle I present to you.
490.716	Could there be order
492.696	in the chaos that I created?
495.7	Let's take a closer look.
497.44	Do you recall when I showed you these puzzle pieces?
501.451	What image did it ultimately become? A cobalt horse.
507.208	The plot thickens.
508.985	And then we played a game of tangrams
511.19	with an emerald rooster.
516.18	That one's my favorite.
518.378	And then we had an experiment with a silver ox.
524.633	And Katy Perry drinks her morning coffee
527.333	out of an amber owl.
531.162	Thank you, Katy, for taking that photo for me.
532.841	Oh, and there's one more, there's one more.
534.806	I believe you colored a red donkey, Gwen.
538.234	Ladies and gentlemen, could you raise your hands
539.864	"for me if you've read ""Don Quixote?"""
542.284	"Who's read ""Don Quixote?"" (Laughter)"
545.179	But wait, but wait, wait, wait, wait, there's more.
546.955	There's more.
548.45	Gwen, I was so confident
551.209	that you were going to make these choices
553.133	that I made another prediction,
555.771	and I put it in an even more indelible place,
559.101	and it's right here.
561.519	Ladies and gentlemen,
562.801	we have today's New York Times.
566.379	The date is March 18th, 2014.
570.204	Many of you in the first couple of rows
572.05	have it underneath your seats as well.
574.17	Really dig. We hid them under there.
576.38	See if you can fish out the newspaper
577.921	and open up to the arts section
580.319	and you will find the crossword puzzle,
583.782	and the crossword puzzle today
585.345	was written by yours truly.
587.404	You can see my name above the grid.
588.47	I'm going to give this to you, Gwen, to take a look.
591.003	And I will also put it up on the screen.
595.196	Now let's take a look
597.078	at another piece of the puzzle.
600.385	If you look at the first clue for 1-across,
603.603	it starts with the letter C, for corrupt,
606.899	and just below that we have an O, for outfielder,
609.825	and if you keep reading the
609.825	first letters of the clues down,
612.771	you get cobalt horse,
615.572	amber owl, silver ox,
619.06	red donkey, and emerald rooster.
622.558	(Applause)
624.164	That's pretty cool, right?
629.735	It's The New York Times.
631.446	But wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait.
633.022	Oh, Gwen,
634.544	do you recall how I forgot my purple marker,
637.148	and you were unable to color the sheep?
640.195	Well, if you keep reading
641.648	starting with 25-down,
643.279	it says,
644.185	"""Oh, by the way,"
645.958	"the sheep can be left blank."""
650.27	(Laughter) (Applause)
654.706	But wait, wait, wait, there's one more thing,
656.28	there's one more thing,
657.483	there's one final piece of the puzzle.
660.322	Gwen, I am so grateful for your choices
664.641	because if we take a look
666.632	at the first letters of your combinations,
668.863	"we get ""C-H-A-O-S"" for chaos"
671.875	"and ""O-R-D-E-R"" for order."
674.698	That's chaos and order.
676.228	We've all made order out of chaos.
677.904	So ladies and gentlemen, the next time
679.907	you find yourself with a puzzle,
681.459	whether it's in your life or in your work,
684.501	or maybe it's at the Sunday morning
685.682	breakfast table with The New York Times,
688.09	remember, you are all wired to solve.
691.932	Thank you.
693.524	(Applause)
