13.1	Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,
14.75	in a 1968 speech where he reflects
14.75	upon the Civil Rights Movement,
18.636	"states, ""In the end,"
21.33	we will remember not the words of our enemies
24.413	"but the silence of our friends."""
27.28	As a teacher, I've internalized this message.
29.8	Every day, all around us,
31.78	we see the consequences of silence
33.456	manifest themselves in the form of discrimination,
35.893	violence, genocide and war.
39.701	In the classroom, I challenge my students
41.897	to explore the silences in their own lives
44.328	through poetry.
46.178	We work together to fill those spaces,
48.03	to recognize them, to name them,
51.308	to understand that they don't
51.308	have to be sources of shame.
54.74	In an effort to create a culture within my classroom
57.203	where students feel safe sharing the intimacies
59.301	of their own silences,
61.135	I have four core principles posted on the board
63.216	that sits in the front of my class,
65.309	which every student signs
65.309	at the beginning of the year:
68.37	read critically, write consciously,
70.543	speak clearly, tell your truth.
74.408	And I find myself thinking a lot about that last point,
76.972	tell your truth.
78.871	And I realized that
80.665	if I was going to ask my students to speak up,
82.876	I was going to have to tell my truth
85.014	and be honest with them about the times
87.28	where I failed to do so.
88.848	So I tell them that growing up,
90.908	as a kid in a Catholic family in New Orleans,
93.576	during Lent I was always taught
96.438	that the most meaningful thing one could do
98.246	was to give something up,
99.788	sacrifice something you typically indulge in
102.08	to prove to God you understand his sanctity.
104.479	I've given up soda, McDonald's, French fries,
107.281	French kisses, and everything in between.
110.183	But one year, I gave up speaking.
114.071	I figured the most valuable thing I could sacrifice
116.674	was my own voice, but it was like I hadn't realized
120.375	that I had given that up a long time ago.
123.286	I spent so much of my life
125.105	telling people the things they wanted to hear
127.282	instead of the things they needed to,
128.758	told myself I wasn't meant to be anyone's conscience
131.174	because I still had to figure out being my own,
133.469	so sometimes I just wouldn't say anything,
136.701	appeasing ignorance with my silence,
139.15	unaware that validation doesn't need words
141.547	to endorse its existence.
143.167	When Christian was beat up for being gay,
144.955	I put my hands in my pocket
146.223	and walked with my head
146.223	down as if I didn't even notice.
149	I couldn't use my locker for weeks
149	because the bolt on the lock
151.535	reminded me of the one I had put on my lips
153.796	when the homeless man on the corner
155.54	looked at me with eyes up merely searching
157.32	for an affirmation that he was worth seeing.
159.502	I was more concerned with
159.502	touching the screen on my Apple
161.607	than actually feeding him one.
163.17	When the woman at the fundraising gala
164.857	"said ""I'm so proud of you."
166.049	It must be so hard teaching
166.049	"those poor, unintelligent kids,"""
169.12	I bit my lip, because apparently
169.12	we needed her money
171.719	more than my students needed their dignity.
173.699	We spend so much time
175.64	listening to the things people are saying
179.54	that we rarely pay attention to the things they don't.
182.878	Silence is the residue of fear.
186.139	It is feeling your flaws
187.689	gut-wrench guillotine your tongue.
189.615	It is the air retreating from your chest
191.437	because it doesn't feel safe in your lungs.
193.429	Silence is Rwandan genocide. Silence is Katrina.
196.553	It is what you hear when there
196.553	aren't enough body bags left.
199.661	It is the sound after the noose is already tied.
202.062	It is charring. It is chains. It is privilege. It is pain.
205.409	There is no time to pick your battles
207.164	when your battles have already picked you.
208.897	I will not let silence wrap itself around my indecision.
211.96	I will tell Christian that he is a lion,
213.927	a sanctuary of bravery and brilliance.
216.287	I will ask that homeless man what his name is
218.683	and how his day was, because sometimes
220.393	all people want to be is human.
222.34	I will tell that woman that my students can talk about
224.826	transcendentalism like their last name was Thoreau,
227.391	and just because you watched
227.391	"one episode of ""The Wire"""
229.426	doesn't mean you know anything about my kids.
231.665	So this year,
233.338	instead of giving something up,
235.485	I will live every day as if there were a microphone
237.897	tucked under my tongue,
239.82	a stage on the underside of my inhibition.
243.825	Because who has to have a soapbox
245.968	when all you've ever needed is your voice?
250.207	Thank you.
252.712	(Applause)
