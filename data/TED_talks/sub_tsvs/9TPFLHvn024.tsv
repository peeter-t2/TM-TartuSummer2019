12.723	I'm 150 feet down an illegal mine shaft in Ghana.
19.123	The air is thick with heat and dust,
23.244	and it's hard to breathe.
26.653	I can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me
29.915	in the darkness, but I can't see much else.
34.161	I hear voices talking, but mostly the shaft
38.131	is this cacophony of men coughing,
42.119	and stone being broken with primitive tools.
46.03	Like the others, I wear a flickering, cheap flashlight
50.085	tied to my head with this elastic, tattered band,
54.881	and I can barely make out the slick tree limbs
58.221	holding up the walls of the three-foot square hole
61.25	dropping hundreds of feet into the earth.
65.876	When my hand slips, I suddenly remember a miner
68.956	I had met days before who had lost his grip
73.237	and fell countless feet down that shaft.
77.858	As I stand talking to you today,
80.389	these men are still deep in that hole,
83.893	risking their lives without payment or compensation,
87.408	and often dying.
90.548	I got to climb out of that hole, and I got to go home,
95.736	but they likely never will, because they're trapped in slavery.
101.918	For the last 28 years, I've been documenting
104.825	indigenous cultures in more than 70 countries
107.386	on six continents, and in 2009 I had the great honor
111.181	of being the sole exhibitor at the Vancouver Peace Summit.
115.593	Amongst all the astonishing people I met there,
119.165	I met a supporter of Free the Slaves, an NGO
122.335	dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery.
127.662	We started talking about slavery, and really,
130.551	I started learning about slavery,
133.415	for I had certainly known it existed in the world,
136.624	but not to such a degree.
139.635	After we finished talking, I felt so horrible
143.378	and honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge
146.754	of this atrocity in my own lifetime, and I thought,
150.264	if I don't know, how many other people don't know?
155.132	It started burning a hole in my stomach, so within weeks,
158.947	I flew down to Los Angeles to meet with the director
161.923	of Free the Slaves and offer them my help.
165.194	Thus began my journey into modern day slavery.
169.764	Oddly, I had been to many of these places before.
172.906	Some I even considered like my second home.
176.387	But this time, I would see the skeletons hidden in the closet.
183.822	A conservative estimate tells us there are more than
190.282	That's double the amount of people taken from Africa
193.762	during the entire trans-Atlantic slave trade.
197.887	A hundred and fifty years ago, an agricultural slave
201.031	cost about three times the annual salary
204.525	of an American worker.
207.271	That equates to about $50,000 in today's money.
211.264	Yet today, entire families can be enslaved for generations
215.656	over a debt as small as $18.
220.524	Astonishingly, slavery generates profits
223.556	of more than $13 billion worldwide each year.
229.302	Many have been tricked by false promises
232.154	of a good education, a better job, only to find
236.7	that they're forced to work without pay
240.208	under the threat of violence, and they cannot walk away.
245.876	Today's slavery is about commerce,
249.158	so the goods that enslaved people produce have value,
253.188	but the people producing them are disposable.
258.186	Slavery exists everywhere, nearly, in the world,
262.576	and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world.
269.543	In India and Nepal, I was introduced to the brick kilns.
274.333	This strange and awesome sight was like
277.124	walking into ancient Egypt or Dante's Inferno.
281.014	Enveloped in temperatures of 130 degrees,
285.165	men, women, children, entire families in fact,
289.26	were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust,
292.411	while mechanically stacking bricks on their head,
295.031	up to 18 at a time, and carrying them
298.152	from the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away.
303.102	Deadened by monotony and exhaustion,
306.629	they work silently, doing this task over and over
312.214	for 16 or 17 hours a day.
315.567	There were no breaks for food, no water breaks,
319.286	and the severe dehydration made urinating
321.838	pretty much inconsequential.
324.71	So pervasive was the heat and the dust
327.142	that my camera became too hot to even touch
330.893	and ceased working.
333.345	Every 20 minutes, I'd have to run back to our cruiser
336.117	to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner
339.466	to revive it, and as I sat there,
342.521	I thought, my camera is getting far better treatment
347.131	than these people.
349.457	Back in the kilns, I wanted to cry,
352.329	but the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me
355.507	"and he said, ""Lisa, don't do that. Just don't do that here."""
359.811	And he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays
363.704	are very dangerous in a place like this,
366.238	not just for me, but for them.
370.092	I couldn't offer them any direct help.
373.742	I couldn't give them money, nothing.
376.535	I wasn't a citizen of that country.
378.332	I could get them in a worse situation
381.42	than they were already in.
384.2	I'd have to rely on Free the Slaves to work
386.456	within the system for their liberation,
389.298	and I trusted that they would.
392.767	As for me, I'd have to wait until I got home
396.204	to really feel my heartbreak.
400.166	In the Himalayas, I found children carrying stone
403.039	for miles down mountainous terrain
405.789	to trucks waiting at roads below.
408.687	The big sheets of slate were heavier
411.205	than the children carrying them,
413.871	and the kids hoisted them from their heads
415.9	using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope
420.344	and torn cloth.
422.191	It's difficult to witness something so overwhelming.
425.866	How can we affect something so insidious,
428.513	yet so pervasive?
431.725	Some don't even know they're enslaved,
434.437	people working 16, 17 hours a day without any pay,
439.443	because this has been the case all their lives.
442.656	They have nothing to compare it to.
446.938	When these villagers claimed their freedom,
450.312	the slaveholders burned down all of their houses.
455.727	I mean, these people had nothing,
457.689	and they were so petrified, they wanted to give up,
461.338	but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere,
465.385	and abolitionists on the ground
466.881	helped them get a quarry lease of their own,
469.54	so that now they do the same back-breaking work,
472.653	but they do it for themselves, and they get paid for it,
477.16	and they do it in freedom.
480.583	Sex trafficking is what we often think of
482.651	when we hear the word slavery,
484.552	and because of this worldwide awareness,
486.511	I was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely
489.647	within this particular industry.
492.469	In Kathmandu, I was escorted by women who had
495.311	previously been sex slaves themselves.
498.847	They ushered me down a narrow set of stairs
501.205	that led to this dirty, dimly fluorescent lit basement.
506.818	This wasn't a brothel, per se.
508.65	It was more like a restaurant.
510.961	Cabin restaurants, as they're known in the trade,
513.221	are venues for forced prostitution.
515.843	Each has small, private rooms, where the slaves,
518.875	women, along with young girls and boys,
521.506	some as young as seven years old,
524.285	are forced to entertain the clients,
526.275	encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol.
530.055	Each cubicle is dark and dingy,
533.094	identified with a painted number on the wall,
537.033	and partitioned by plywood and a curtain.
541.138	The workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse
544.689	at the hands of their customers.
547.271	Standing in the near darkness, I remember feeling
550.337	this quick, hot fear, and in that instant,
554.423	I could only imagine what it must be like
556.768	to be trapped in that hell.
559.431	I had only one way out: the stairs from where I'd come in.
564.033	There were no back doors.
565.889	There were no windows large enough to climb through.
568.432	These people have no escape at all,
572.692	and as we take in such a difficult subject,
575.752	it's important to note that slavery, including sex trafficking,
580.363	occurs in our own backyard as well.
583.292	Tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture,
587.916	in restaurants, in domestic servitude,
590.588	and the list can go on.
593.22	Recently, the New York Times reported that
595.859	between 100,000 and 300,000 American children
601.665	are sold into sex slavery every year.
605.626	It's all around us. We just don't see it.
612.169	The textile industry is another one we often think of
615.551	when we hear about slave labor.
618.437	I visited villages in India where entire families were enslaved
622.76	in the silk trade.
625.405	This is a family portrait.
627.697	The dyed black hands are the father, while the blue
631.585	and red hands are his sons.
634.374	They mix dye in these big barrels,
637.098	and they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their elbows,
641.063	but the dye is toxic.
646.025	My interpreter told me their stories.
649.33	"""We have no freedom,"" they said."
652.932	"""We hope still, though, that we could leave this house"
656.036	someday and go someplace else
657.69	"where we actually get paid for our dyeing."""
664.354	It's estimated that more than 4,000 children
669.293	are enslaved on Lake Volta,
671.45	the largest man-made lake in the world.
675.536	When we first arrived, I went to have a quick look.
678.51	I saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat,
681.878	two older brothers, some younger kids, makes sense right?
686.043	Wrong. They were all enslaved.
690.091	Children are taken from their families
692.92	and trafficked and vanished,
695.427	and they're forced to work endless hours on these boats
698.339	on the lake, even though they do not know how to swim.
702.886	This young child is eight years old.
705.221	He was trembling when our boat approached,
707.877	frightened it would run over his tiny canoe.
710.532	He was petrified he would be knocked in the water.
713.871	The skeletal tree limbs submerged in Lake Volta
717.156	often catch the fishing nets, and weary,
721.121	frightened children are thrown into the water
724.854	to untether the lines.
727.005	Many of them drown.
729.852	For as long as he can recall, he's been forced to work
733.192	on the lake.
735.365	Terrified of his master, he will not run away,
738.829	and since he's been treated with cruelty all his life,
742.317	he passes that down to the younger slaves
744.749	that he manages.
747.754	I met these boys at five in the morning,
749.858	when they were hauling in the last of their nets,
752.319	but they had been working since 1 a.m.
755.18	in the cold, windy night.
758.755	And it's important to note that these nets weigh
762.021	more than a thousand pounds when they're full of fish.
766.437	I want to introduce you to Kofi.
770.94	Kofi was rescued from a fishing village.
774.186	I met him at a shelter where Free the Slaves
776.778	rehabilitates victims of slavery.
780.707	Here he's seen taking a bath at the well,
782.788	pouring big buckets of water over his head,
785.691	and the wonderful news is,
787.612	as you and I are sitting here talking today,
789.61	Kofi has been reunited with his family,
792.845	and what's even better, his family has been given tools
795.997	to make a living and to keep their children safe.
801.724	Kofi is the embodiment of possibility.
806.177	Who will he become because someone took a stand
810.748	and made a difference in his life?
814.34	Driving down a road in Ghana
816.568	with partners of Free the Slaves,
818.656	a fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up
821.698	to our cruiser and tapped on the window.
824.645	He told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jungle.
829.425	At the end of the road, he urged us out of the car,
832.214	and told the driver to quickly leave.
834.893	Then he pointed toward this barely visible footpath,
838.238	"and said, ""This is the path, this is the path. Go."""
842.135	As we started down the path, we pushed aside the vines
845.804	blocking the way, and after about an hour of walking in,
849.604	found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains,
855.13	so I hoisted the photo gear above my head
856.946	as we descended into these waters up to my chest.
861.532	After another two hours of hiking, the winding trail
865.317	abruptly ended at a clearing, and before us
869.613	was a mass of holes
871.629	that could fit into the size of a football field,
875.449	and all of them were full of enslaved people laboring.
881.043	Many women had children strapped to their backs
884.188	while they were panning for gold,
886.228	wading in water poisoned by mercury.
890.531	Mercury is used in the extraction process.
895.409	These miners are enslaved in a mine shaft
898.565	in another part of Ghana.
901.639	When they came out of the shaft, they were soaking wet
904.46	from their own sweat.
906.738	I remember looking into their tired, bloodshot eyes,
910.741	for many of them had been underground for 72 hours.
916.482	The shafts are up to 300 feet deep, and they carry out
920.457	heavy bags of stone that later will be transported
924.026	to another area, where the stone will be pounded
926.627	so that they can extract the gold.
930.572	At first glance, the pounding site seems full
934.677	of powerful men, but when we look closer,
939.57	we see some less fortunate working on the fringes,
944.437	and children too.
946.58	All of them are victim to injury, illness and violence.
953.722	In fact, it's very likely that this muscular person
957.702	will end up like this one here, racked with tuberculosis
962.237	and mercury poisoning in just a few years.
967.208	This is Manuru. When his father died,
971.485	his uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines.
974.567	When his uncle died, Manuru inherited his uncle's debt,
979.163	which further forced him into being enslaved in the mines.
984.105	When I met him, he had been working in the mines
986.938	for 14 years, and the leg injury that you see here
991.731	is actually from a mining accident,
993.744	one so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated.
998.877	On top of that, Manuru has tuberculosis,
1002.827	yet he's still forced to work day in and day out
1005.871	in that mine shaft.
1008.115	Even still, he has a dream that he will become free
1013.278	and become educated with the help of local activists
1016.391	like Free the Slaves,
1018.819	and it's this sort of determination,
1021.171	in the face of unimaginable odds,
1025.049	that fills me with complete awe.
1032.409	I want to shine a light on slavery.
1035.709	When I was working in the field,
1037.964	I brought lots of candles with me,
1040.645	and with the help of my interpreter,
1043.367	I imparted to the people I was photographing
1045.683	that I wanted to illuminate their stories
1048.794	and their plight,
1050.861	so when it was safe for them, and safe for me,
1054.366	I made these images.
1057.707	They knew their image would be seen
1059.94	by you out in the world.
1061.769	I wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness
1065.513	to them, and that we will do whatever we can
1069.442	to help make a difference in their lives.
1074.132	I truly believe, if we can see one another
1077.612	as fellow human beings, then it becomes very difficult
1082.096	to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
1087.3	These images are not of issues. They are of people,
1090.984	real people, like you and me, all deserving
1094.249	of the same rights, dignity and respect
1097.729	in their lives.
1099.958	There is not a day that goes by that I don't think
1103.193	of these many beautiful, mistreated people
1108.472	I've had the tremendous honor of meeting.
1113.041	I hope that these images awaken a force
1116.571	in those who view them, people like you,
1119.617	and I hope that force will ignite a fire,
1123.893	and that fire will shine a light on slavery,
1128.816	for without that light, the beast of bondage
1132.825	can continue to live in the shadows.
1136.009	Thank you very much.
1138.986	(Applause)
