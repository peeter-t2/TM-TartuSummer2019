15.693	I want you to imagine this for a moment.
18.464	Two men, Rahul and Rajiv,
21.359	living in the same neighborhood,
23.217	from the same educational background, similar occupation,
26.512	and they both turn up at their local accident emergency
29.28	complaining of acute chest pain.
32.096	Rahul is offered a cardiac procedure,
35.22	but Rajiv is sent home.
38.031	What might explain the difference in the experience
40.541	of these two nearly identical men?
43.793	Rajiv suffers from a mental illness.
47.28	The difference in the quality of medical care
50.379	received by people with mental illness is one of the reasons
53.24	why they live shorter lives
55.155	than people without mental illness.
56.738	Even in the best-resourced countries in the world,
59.408	this life expectancy gap is as much as 20 years.
64.178	In the developing countries of the world, this gap
66.103	is even larger.
68.728	But of course, mental illnesses can kill in more direct ways
71.587	as well. The most obvious example is suicide.
74.948	It might surprise some of you here, as it did me,
77.603	when I discovered that suicide is at the top of the list
80.54	of the leading causes of death in young people
83.105	in all countries in the world,
84.753	including the poorest countries of the world.
88.145	But beyond the impact of a health condition
90.979	on life expectancy, we're also concerned
93.349	about the quality of life lived.
96.043	Now, in order for us to examine the overall impact
98.292	of a health condition both on life expectancy
100.665	as well as on the quality of life lived, we need to use
103.823	a metric called the DALY,
105.209	which stands for a Disability-Adjusted Life Year.
109.496	Now when we do that, we discover some startling things
112.017	about mental illness from a global perspective.
114.839	We discover that, for example, mental illnesses are
118.103	amongst the leading causes of disability around the world.
122.691	Depression, for example, is the third-leading cause
125.426	of disability, alongside conditions such as
128.398	diarrhea and pneumonia in children.
131.75	When you put all the mental illnesses together,
133.854	they account for roughly 15 percent
136.116	of the total global burden of disease.
139.322	Indeed, mental illnesses are also very damaging
143.833	to people's lives, but beyond just the burden of disease,
149.278	let us consider the absolute numbers.
151.99	The World Health Organization estimates
154.049	that there are nearly four to five hundred million people
157.154	living on our tiny planet
159.337	who are affected by a mental illness.
160.998	Now some of you here
162.717	look a bit astonished by that number,
165.315	but consider for a moment the incredible diversity
167.808	of mental illnesses, from autism and intellectual disability
170.962	in childhood, through to depression and anxiety,
173.643	substance misuse and psychosis in adulthood,
175.924	all the way through to dementia in old age,
177.56	and I'm pretty sure that each and every one us
180.514	present here today can think of at least one person,
183.866	at least one person, who's affected by mental illness
187.188	in our most intimate social networks.
191.619	I see some nodding heads there.
194.824	But beyond the staggering numbers,
197.794	what's truly important from a global health point of view,
200.803	what's truly worrying from a global health point of view,
203.348	is that the vast majority of these affected individuals
206.516	do not receive the care
208.525	that we know can transform their lives, and remember,
210.991	we do have robust evidence that a range of interventions,
214.052	medicines, psychological interventions,
216.504	and social interventions, can make a vast difference.
219.992	And yet, even in the best-resourced countries,
222.243	for example here in Europe, roughly 50 percent
225.178	of affected people don't receive these interventions.
228.295	In the sorts of countries I work in,
230.612	that so-called treatment gap
232.762	approaches an astonishing 90 percent.
237.649	It isn't surprising, then, that if you should speak
240.861	to anyone affected by a mental illness,
243.292	the chances are that you will hear stories
246.104	of hidden suffering, shame and discrimination
250.154	in nearly every sector of their lives.
253.103	But perhaps most heartbreaking of all
255.813	are the stories of the abuse
258.502	of even the most basic human rights,
261.034	such as the young woman shown in this image here
263.891	that are played out every day,
265.955	sadly, even in the very institutions that were built to care
269.899	for people with mental illnesses, the mental hospitals.
273.734	It's this injustice that has really driven my mission
276.762	to try to do a little bit to transform the lives
279.154	of people affected by mental illness, and a particularly
281.9	critical action that I focused on is to bridge the gulf
285.749	between the knowledge we have that can transform lives,
288.535	the knowledge of effective treatments, and how we actually
290.977	use that knowledge in the everyday world.
294.399	And an especially important challenge that I've had to face
297.558	is the great shortage of mental health professionals,
300.483	such as psychiatrists and psychologists,
302.155	particularly in the developing world.
304.943	Now I trained in medicine in India, and after that
307.628	I chose psychiatry as my specialty, much to the dismay
311.047	of my mother and all my family members who
313.275	kind of thought neurosurgery would be
314.978	a more respectable option for their brilliant son.
318.147	Any case, I went on, I soldiered on with psychiatry,
320.881	and found myself training in Britain in some of
323.176	the best hospitals in this country. I was very privileged.
325.551	I worked in a team of incredibly talented, compassionate,
329.094	but most importantly, highly trained, specialized
332.345	mental health professionals.
334.536	Soon after my training, I found myself working
336.508	first in Zimbabwe and then in India, and I was confronted
338.951	by an altogether new reality.
341.811	This was a reality of a world in which there were almost no
345.157	mental health professionals at all.
347.522	In Zimbabwe, for example, there were just about
349.556	a dozen psychiatrists, most of whom lived and worked
352.616	in Harare city, leaving only a couple
354.742	to address the mental health care needs
357.135	of nine million people living in the countryside.
360.803	In India, I found the situation was not a lot better.
364.42	To give you a perspective, if I had to translate
366.843	the proportion of psychiatrists in the population
369.051	that one might see in Britain to India,
371.433	one might expect roughly 150,000 psychiatrists in India.
377.042	In reality, take a guess.
380.073	The actual number is about 3,000,
382.638	about two percent of that number.
385.102	It became quickly apparent to me that I couldn't follow
387.599	the sorts of mental health care models that I had been trained in,
390.66	one that relied heavily on specialized, expensive
393.599	mental health professionals to provide mental health care
396.131	in countries like India and Zimbabwe.
398.591	I had to think out of the box about some other model
401.244	of care.
402.867	It was then that I came across these books,
405.98	and in these books I discovered the idea of task shifting
409.223	in global health.
411.291	The idea is actually quite simple. The idea is,
413.567	when you're short of specialized health care professionals,
416.581	use whoever is available in the community,
419.63	train them to provide a range of health care interventions,
422.567	and in these books I read inspiring examples,
425.435	for example of how ordinary people had been trained
428.371	to deliver babies,
429.724	diagnose and treat early pneumonia, to great effect.
433.355	And it struck me that if you could train ordinary people
436.106	to deliver such complex health care interventions,
438.33	then perhaps they could also do the same
440.403	with mental health care.
442.395	Well today, I'm very pleased to report to you
445.264	that there have been many experiments in task shifting
448.376	in mental health care across the developing world
451.147	over the past decade, and I want to share with you
453.21	the findings of three particular such experiments,
455.907	all three of which focused on depression,
457.994	the most common of all mental illnesses.
460.429	In rural Uganda, Paul Bolton and his colleagues,
463.771	using villagers, demonstrated that they could deliver
467.615	interpersonal psychotherapy for depression
469.97	and, using a randomized control design,
472.642	showed that 90 percent of the people receiving
474.887	this intervention recovered as compared
476.847	to roughly 40 percent in the comparison villages.
480.388	Similarly, using a randomized control trial in rural Pakistan,
484.528	Atif Rahman and his colleagues showed
486.868	that lady health visitors, who are community maternal
489.603	health workers in Pakistan's health care system,
492.392	could deliver cognitive behavior therapy for mothers
494.609	who were depressed, again showing dramatic differences
497.117	in the recovery rates. Roughly 75 percent of mothers
499.964	recovered as compared to about 45 percent
502.529	in the comparison villages.
504.813	And in my own trial in Goa, in India, we again showed
507.899	that lay counselors drawn from local communities
510.427	could be trained to deliver psychosocial interventions
513.111	for depression, anxiety, leading to 70 percent
515.693	recovery rates as compared to 50 percent
517.776	in the comparison primary health centers.
520.982	Now, if I had to draw together all these different
522.951	experiments in task shifting, and there have of course
525.483	been many other examples, and try and identify
527.857	what are the key lessons we can learn that makes
529.875	for a successful task shifting operation,
532.953	I have coined this particular acronym, SUNDAR.
536.809	"What SUNDAR stands for, in Hindi, is ""attractive."""
541.043	It seems to me that there are five key lessons
543.258	that I've shown on this slide that are critically important
545.857	for effective task shifting.
548.04	The first is that we need to simplify the message
551.066	that we're using, stripping away all the jargon
553.45	that medicine has invented around itself.
556.771	We need to unpack complex health care interventions
559.728	into smaller components that can be more easily
561.956	transferred to less-trained individuals.
564.611	We need to deliver health care, not in large institutions,
567.178	but close to people's homes, and we need to deliver
569.404	health care using whoever is available and affordable
572.176	in our local communities.
574.557	And importantly, we need to reallocate the few specialists
577.437	who are available to perform roles
579.505	such as capacity-building and supervision.
582.983	Now for me, task shifting is an idea
585.315	with truly global significance,
588.274	because even though it has arisen out of the
590.807	situation of the lack of resources that you find
594.305	in developing countries, I think it has a lot of significance
597.264	for better-resourced countries as well. Why is that?
600.145	Well, in part, because health care in the developed world,
603.665	the health care costs in the [developed] world,
606.14	are rapidly spiraling out of control, and a huge chunk
608.717	of those costs are human resource costs.
612.137	But equally important is because health care has become
614.623	so incredibly professionalized that it's become very remote
618.46	and removed from local communities.
621.215	For me, what's truly sundar about the idea of task shifting,
624.937	though, isn't that it simply makes health care
626.583	more accessible and affordable but that
629.741	it is also fundamentally empowering.
632.297	It empowers ordinary people to be more effective
635.929	in caring for the health of others in their community,
638.752	and in doing so, to become better guardians
640.241	of their own health. Indeed, for me, task shifting
643.523	is the ultimate example of the democratization
646.21	of medical knowledge, and therefore, medical power.
651.459	Just over 30 years ago, the nations of the world assembled
654.91	at Alma-Ata and made this iconic declaration.
657.883	Well, I think all of you can guess
659.488	that 12 years on, we're still nowhere near that goal.
663.203	Still, today, armed with that knowledge
665.868	that ordinary people in the community
668.524	can be trained and, with sufficient supervision and support,
671.687	can deliver a range of health care interventions effectively,
674.959	perhaps that promise is within reach now.
678.84	Indeed, to implement the slogan of Health for All,
682.484	we will need to involve all
684.27	in that particular journey,
685.929	and in the case of mental health, in particular we would
688.875	need to involve people who are affected by mental illness
691.778	and their caregivers.
693.232	It is for this reason that, some years ago,
695.768	the Movement for Global Mental Health was founded
697.686	as a sort of a virtual platform upon which professionals
701.709	like myself and people affected by mental illness
704.516	could stand together, shoulder-to-shoulder,
707.228	and advocate for the rights of people with mental illness
709.714	to receive the care that we know can transform their lives,
712.931	and to live a life with dignity.
715.94	And in closing, when you have a moment of peace or quiet
719.457	in these very busy few days or perhaps afterwards,
722.283	spare a thought for that person you thought about
725.037	who has a mental illness, or persons that you thought about
727.614	who have mental illness,
729.202	and dare to care for them. Thank you. (Applause)
