12.806	Imagine that you invented a device
14.905	that can record my memories,
16.601	my dreams, my ideas,
18.662	and transmit them to your brain.
20.755	That would be a game-changing
20.755	technology, right?
23.854	But in fact, we already
23.854	possess this device,
26.916	and it's called human communication system
29.584	and effective storytelling.
31.874	To understand how this device works,
34.358	we have to look into our brains.
36.797	And we have to formulate the question
36.797	in a slightly different manner.
40.407	Now we have to ask
42.309	how these neuron patterns in my brain
44.949	that are associated
44.949	with my memories and ideas
48.175	are transmitted into your brains.
51.702	And we think there are two factors
51.702	that enable us to communicate.
55.094	First, your brain is now
55.094	physically coupled to the sound wave
59.173	that I'm transmitting to your brain.
61.672	And second, we developed
61.672	a common neural protocol
65.074	that enabled us to communicate.
67.459	So how do we know that?
69.292	In my lab in Princeton,
71.209	we bring people to the fMRI scanner
71.209	and we scan their brains
74.738	while they are either telling
74.738	or listening to real-life stories.
78.662	And to give you a sense
78.662	of the stimulus we are using,
81.31	let me play 20 seconds
81.31	from a story that we used,
85.318	told by a very talented storyteller,
87.666	Jim O'Grady.
90.244	(Audio) Jim O'Grady: So I'm banging out
90.244	my story and I know it's good,
93.601	and then I start to make it better --
95.915	(Laughter)
98.423	by adding an element of embellishment.
101.502	"Reporters call this ""making shit up."""
104.834	(Laughter)
107.735	And they recommend
107.735	against crossing that line.
112.208	But I had just seen the line crossed
112.208	between a high-powered dean
116.836	and assault with a pastry.
118.286	"And I kinda liked it."""
119.802	Uri Hasson: OK, so now
119.802	let's look into your brain
122.2	and see what's happening
122.2	when you listen to these kinds of stories.
125.452	And let's start simple -- let's start
125.452	with one listener and one brain area:
129.52	the auditory cortex that processes
129.52	the sounds that come from the ear.
133.033	And as you can see,
133.033	in this particular brain area,
135.501	the responses are going up and down
135.501	as the story is unfolding.
139.017	Now we can take these responses
140.634	and compare them to the responses
140.634	in other listeners
143.459	in the same brain area.
144.958	And we can ask:
146.149	How similar are the responses
146.149	across all listeners?
150.018	So here you can see five listeners.
152.983	And we start to scan their brains
152.983	before the story starts,
156.46	when they're simply lying in the dark
156.46	and waiting for the story to begin.
160.023	As you can see,
161.201	the brain area is going up and down
161.201	in each one of them,
163.983	but the responses are very different,
165.782	and not in sync.
167.473	However, immediately
167.473	as the story is starting,
170.203	something amazing is happening.
172.857	(Audio) JO: So I'm banging out my story
172.857	and I know it's good,
175.81	and then I start to make it --
177.362	UH: Suddenly, you can see
177.362	that the responses in all of the subjects
180.683	lock to the story,
181.859	and now they are going up and down
181.859	in a very similar way
185.312	across all listeners.
186.89	And in fact, this is exactly
186.89	what is happening now in your brains
189.963	when you listen to my sound speaking.
192.86	"We call this effect ""neural entrainment."""
196.374	And to explain to you
196.374	what is neural entrainment,
198.71	let me first explain
198.71	what is physical entrainment.
202.076	So, we'll look and see five metronomes.
204.85	Think of these five metronomes
204.85	as five brains.
207.87	And similar to the listeners
207.87	before the story starts,
210.644	these metronomes are going to click,
212.481	but they're going to click out of phase.
215.059	(Clicking)
219.479	Now see what will happen
219.479	when I connect them together
222.504	by placing them on these two cylinders.
225.88	(Clicking)
229.125	Now these two cylinders start to rotate.
231.761	This rotation vibration
231.761	is going through the wood
234.914	and is going to couple
234.914	all the metronomes together.
237.943	And now listen to the click.
239.579	(Synchronized clicking)
249.834	This is what you call
249.834	physical entrainment.
252.482	Now let's go back to the brain and ask:
254.749	What's driving this neural entrainment?
256.917	Is it simply the sounds
256.917	that the speaker is producing?
259.726	Or maybe it's the words.
261.073	Or maybe it's the meaning
261.073	that the speaker is trying to convey.
264.743	So to test it, we did
264.743	the following experiment.
267.527	First, we took the story
267.527	and played it backwards.
270.752	And that preserved many
270.752	of the original auditory features,
273.902	but removed the meaning.
275.939	And it sounds something like that.
277.634	(Audio) JO: (Unintelligible)
283.296	And we flashed colors in the two brains
285.672	to indicate brain areas that respond
285.672	very similarly across people.
289.608	And as you can see,
290.786	this incoming sound induced entrainment
290.786	or alignment in all of the brains
294.578	in auditory cortices
294.578	that process the sounds,
297.334	but it didn't spread
297.334	deeper into the brain.
300.051	Now we can take these sounds
300.051	and build words out of it.
303.479	So if we take Jim O'Grady
303.479	and scramble the words,
306.159	we'll get a list of words.
307.423	(Audio) JO: ... an animal ...
307.423	assorted facts ...
309.709	and right on ... pie man ...
309.709	potentially ... my stories
312.625	UH: And you can see that these words
312.625	start to induce alignment
315.591	in early language areas,
315.591	but not more than that.
318.22	Now we can take the words
318.22	and start to build sentences out of them.
323.561	(Audio) JO: And they recommend
323.561	against crossing that line.
328.021	"He says: ""Dear Jim,"
328.021	Good story. Nice details.
332.369	Didn't she only know
332.369	"about him through me?"""
334.545	UH: Now you can see that the responses
334.545	in all the language areas
337.704	that process the incoming language
339.419	become aligned or similar
339.419	across all listeners.
342.218	However, only when we use
342.218	the full, engaging, coherent story
346.919	do the responses spread
346.919	deeper into the brain
349.168	into higher-order areas,
350.723	which include the frontal cortex
350.723	and the parietal cortex,
353.848	and make all of them
353.848	respond very similarly.
356.46	And we believe that these responses
356.46	in higher-order areas are induced
359.753	or become similar across listeners
361.903	because of the meaning
361.903	conveyed by the speaker,
364.667	and not by words or sound.
366.635	And if we are right,
366.635	there's a strong prediction over here
369.374	if I tell you the exact same ideas
371.76	using two very different sets of words,
374.428	your brain responses
374.428	will still be similar.
377.499	And to test it, we did
377.499	the following experiment in my lab.
381.142	We took the English story
382.974	and translated it to Russian.
385.134	Now you have two different sounds
385.134	and linguistic systems
389.382	that convey the exact same meaning.
391.7	And you play the English story
391.7	to the English listeners
395.372	and the Russian story
395.372	to the Russian listeners,
397.748	and we can compare their responses
397.748	across the groups.
400.817	And when we did that, we didn't see
400.817	responses that are similar
404.412	in auditory cortices in language,
406.717	because the language
406.717	and sound are very different.
409.119	However, you can see
409.119	that the responses in high-order areas
411.921	were still similar
411.921	across these two groups.
415.068	We believe this is because they understood
415.068	the story in a very similar way,
419.184	as we confirmed, using a test
419.184	after the story ended.
424.321	And we think that this alignment
424.321	is necessary for communication.
428.032	For example, as you can tell,
430.682	I am not a native English speaker.
432.733	I grew up with another language,
434.638	and the same might be for many
434.638	of you in the audience.
437.316	And still, we can communicate.
439.339	How come?
440.514	We think we can communicate
440.514	because we have this common code
443.617	that presents meaning.
445.921	So far, I've only talked about
445.921	what's happening in the listener's brain,
449.391	in your brain, when
449.391	you're listening to talks.
451.662	But what's happening
451.662	in the speaker's brain, in my brain,
454.385	when I'm speaking to you?
456.216	To look in the speaker's brain,
458.097	we asked the speaker
458.097	to go into the scanner,
461.217	we scan his brain
462.843	and then compare his brain responses
462.843	to the brain responses of the listeners
466.874	listening to the story.
468.7	You have to remember that producing speech
468.7	and comprehending speech
472.934	are very different processes.
474.681	Here we're asking: How similar are they?
478.164	To our surprise,
479.595	we saw that all these complex
479.595	patterns within the listeners
484.49	actually came from the speaker brain.
487.221	So production and comprehension
487.221	rely on very similar processes.
490.93	And we also found
492.526	the stronger the similarity
492.526	between the listener's brain
496.256	and the speaker's brain,
497.779	the better the communication.
499.708	So I know that if you
499.708	are completely confused now,
503.697	and I do hope that this is not the case,
505.742	your brain responses
505.742	are very different than mine.
508.159	But I also know that if you really
508.159	understand me now,
511.29	then your brain ... and your brain
511.29	... and your brain
514.205	are really similar to mine.
517.793	Now, let's take all
517.793	this information together and ask:
520.912	How can we use it to transmit
520.912	a memory that I have
524.273	from my brain to your brains?
527.037	So we did the following experiment.
529.648	We let people watch,
529.648	for the first time in their life,
532.245	a TV episode from the BBC series
532.245	"""Sherlock,"" while we scanned their brains."
536.403	And then we asked them
536.403	to go back to the scanner
539.228	and tell the story to another person
539.228	that never watched the movie.
543.151	So let's be specific.
544.835	Think about this exact scene,
546.906	when Sherlock is entering
546.906	the cab in London
549.514	driven by the murderer he is looking for.
552.398	With me, as a viewer,
554.918	there is a specific brain pattern
554.918	in my brain when I watch it.
559.179	Now, the exact same pattern,
559.179	I can reactivate in my brain again
562.975	by telling the word:
562.975	Sherlock, London, murderer.
567.369	And when I'm transmitting
567.369	these words to your brains now,
570.503	you have to reconstruct it in your mind.
573.012	In fact, we see that pattern
573.012	emerging now in your brains.
577.585	And we were really surprised to see
580.124	that the pattern you have
580.124	now in your brains
582.403	when I'm describing to you these scenes
584.339	would be very similar to the pattern
584.339	I had when I watched this movie
588.185	a few months ago in the scanner.
590.347	This starts to tell you
590.347	about the mechanism
592.475	by which we can tell stories
592.475	and transmit information.
595.733	Because, for example,
597.633	now you're listening really hard
597.633	and trying to understand what I'm saying.
601.169	And I know that it's not easy.
602.743	But I hope that at one point
602.743	in the talk we clicked, and you got me.
606.803	And I think that in a few hours,
606.803	a few days, a few months,
610.725	you're going to meet someone at a party,
612.893	and you're going to tell him
612.893	about this lecture,
616.465	and suddenly it will be as if
616.465	he is standing now here with us.
620.127	Now you can see
620.127	how we can take this mechanism
623.001	and try to transmit memories
623.001	and knowledge across people,
626.956	which is wonderful, right?
629.027	But our ability to communicate
629.027	relies on our ability
632.218	to have common ground.
634.808	Because, for example,
636.037	if I'm going to use the British synonym
639.828	"""hackney carriage"" instead of ""cab,"""
642.23	I know that I'm going to be misaligned
642.23	with most of you in the audience.
646.72	This alignment depends
646.72	not only on our ability
648.935	to understand the basic concept;
650.993	it also depends on our ability to develop
650.993	common ground and understanding
655.812	and shared belief systems.
657.623	Because we know that in many cases,
659.481	people understand the exact
659.481	same story in very different ways.
664.46	So to test it in the lab,
664.46	we did the following experiment.
668.089	We took a story by J.D. Salinger,
671.044	in which a husband lost track
671.044	of his wife in the middle of a party,
675.403	and he's calling his best friend, asking,
675.403	"""Did you see my wife?"""
679.836	For half of the subjects,
681.067	we said that the wife was having
681.067	an affair with the best friend.
685.232	For the other half,
686.407	we said that the wife is loyal
686.407	and the husband is very jealous.
692.127	This one sentence before the story started
694.839	was enough to make the brain responses
697.164	of all the people that believed
697.164	the wife was having an affair
700.232	be very similar in these high-order areas
702.693	and different than the other group.
704.939	And if one sentence is enough
704.939	to make your brain similar
708.636	to people that think like you
710.263	and very different than people
710.263	that think differently than you,
713.24	think how this effect is going
713.24	to be amplified in real life,
716.741	when we are all listening
716.741	to the exact same news item
719.657	after being exposed
719.657	day after day after day
723.429	to different media channels,
723.429	like Fox News or The New York Times,
727.265	that give us very different
727.265	perspectives on reality.
731.556	So let me summarize.
733.529	If everything worked as planned tonight,
735.642	I used my ability to vocalize sound
735.642	to be coupled to your brains.
739.965	And I used this coupling
741.492	to transmit my brain patterns associated
741.492	with my memories and ideas
745.357	into your brains.
747.201	In this, I start to reveal
747.201	the hidden neural mechanism
751.023	by which we communicate.
752.682	And we know that in the future
752.682	it will enable us to improve
755.673	and facilitate communication.
758.111	But these studies also reveal
760.535	that communication relies
760.535	on a common ground.
763.845	And we have to be
763.845	really worried as a society
766.331	if we lose this common ground
766.331	and our ability to speak with people
770.391	that are slightly different than us
772.532	because we let a few very strong
772.532	media channels
775.944	take control of the mic,
777.509	and manipulate and control
777.509	the way we all think.
781.308	And I'm not sure how to fix it
781.308	because I'm only a scientist.
784.233	But maybe one way to do it
786.717	is to go back to the more
786.717	natural way of communication,
789.388	which is a dialogue,
791.014	in which it's not only me
791.014	speaking to you now,
793.994	but a more natural way of talking,
796.234	in which I am speaking and I am listening,
799.535	and together we are trying to come
799.535	to a common ground and new ideas.
804.279	Because after all,
805.461	the people we are coupled to
805.461	define who we are.
809.149	And our desire to be coupled
809.149	to another brain
811.562	is something very basic
811.562	that starts at a very early age.
816.103	So let me finish with an example
816.103	from my own private life
821.044	that I think is a good example
821.044	of how coupling to other people
825.379	is really going to define who we are.
828.294	This my son Jonathan at a very early age.
831.392	See how he developed
831.392	a vocal game together with my wife,
835.566	only from the desire and pure joy
835.566	of being coupled to another human being.
841.556	(Both vocalizing)
854.915	(Laughter)
857.267	Now, think how the ability of my son
861.088	to be coupled to us
861.088	and other people in his life
863.874	is going to shape the man
863.874	he is going to become.
866.756	And think how you change on a daily basis
869.195	from the interaction and coupling
869.195	to other people in your life.
874.562	So keep being coupled to other people.
877.157	Keep spreading your ideas,
878.73	because the sum of all of us
878.73	together, coupled,
881.998	is greater than our parts.
883.616	Thank you.
884.806	(Applause)
