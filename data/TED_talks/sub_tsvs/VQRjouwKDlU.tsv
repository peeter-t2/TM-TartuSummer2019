12.84	The language I'm speaking right now
15.44	is on its way to becoming
15.44	the world's universal language,
19.8	for better or for worse.
22.16	Let's face it,
23.4	it's the language of the internet,
25.28	it's the language of finance,
27.28	it's the language of air traffic control,
29.64	of popular music,
31.04	diplomacy --
32.28	English is everywhere.
34.32	Now, Mandarin Chinese
34.32	is spoken by more people,
38.44	but more Chinese people
38.44	are learning English
40.96	than English speakers
40.96	are learning Chinese.
43.68	Last I heard,
45.44	there are two dozen universities
45.44	in China right now
48.92	teaching all in English.
51.68	English is taking over.
53.68	And in addition to that,
55.4	it's been predicted
55.4	that at the end of the century
58.04	almost all of the languages
58.04	that exist now --
61.04	there are about 6,000 --
62.32	will no longer be spoken.
64.24	There will only be some hundreds left.
67.36	And on top of that,
69	it's at the point where
69	instant translation of live speech
73.6	is not only possible,
73.6	but it gets better every year.
77.36	The reason I'm reciting
77.36	those things to you
80.12	is because I can tell
80.12	that we're getting to the point
83.28	where a question
83.28	is going to start being asked,
85.52	which is: Why should we
85.52	learn foreign languages --
89.08	other than if English
89.08	happens to be foreign to one?
93.08	Why bother to learn another one
93.08	when it's getting to the point
96.12	where almost everybody in the world
96.12	will be able to communicate in one?
102.56	I think there are a lot of reasons,
104.4	but I first want to address
106.76	the one that you're probably
106.76	most likely to have heard of,
109.64	because actually it's more
109.64	dangerous than you might think.
114	And that is the idea
115.76	that a language channels your thoughts,
118.56	that the vocabulary
118.56	and the grammar of different languages
122.96	gives everybody
122.96	a different kind of acid trip,
126.8	so to speak.
128.04	That is a marvelously enticing idea,
132.28	but it's kind of fraught.
133.6	So it's not that it's untrue completely.
137.08	So for example, in French and Spanish
140.919	the word for table is,
140.919	for some reason, marked as feminine.
145.2	"So, ""la table,"" ""la mesa,"""
145.2	you just have to deal with it.
149.16	It has been shown
150.68	that if you are a speaker
150.68	of one of those languages
153.1	and you happen to be asked
155.8	how you would imagine a table talking,
159.88	then much more often
159.88	than could possibly be an accident,
163.8	a French or a Spanish speaker
165.52	says that the table would talk
165.52	with a high and feminine voice.
170.4	So if you're French or Spanish,
170.4	to you, a table is kind of a girl,
174.56	as opposed to if you
174.56	are an English speaker.
177.76	It's hard not to love data like that,
179.6	and many people
179.6	will tell you that that means
181.76	that there's a worldview that you have
181.76	if you speak one of those languages.
186.6	But you have to watch out,
187.92	because imagine if somebody
187.92	put us under the microscope,
192.4	the us being those of us
192.4	who speak English natively.
194.88	What is the worldview from English?
198.76	So for example,
198.76	let's take an English speaker.
201.52	Up on the screen, that is Bono.
204.84	He speaks English.
206.48	I presume he has a worldview.
209.44	Now, that is Donald Trump.
213.12	In his way,
214.36	he speaks English as well.
215.8	(Laughter)
219.52	And here is Ms. Kardashian,
222.88	and she is an English speaker, too.
224.88	So here are three speakers
224.88	of the English language.
227.68	What worldview do those
227.68	three people have in common?
231.28	What worldview is shaped through
231.28	the English language that unites them?
236.4	It's a highly fraught concept.
238.24	And so gradual consensus is becoming
238.24	that language can shape thought,
243.12	but it tends to be in rather darling,
243.12	obscure psychological flutters.
249.6	It's not a matter of giving you
249.6	a different pair of glasses on the world.
254.68	Now, if that's the case,
257.04	then why learn languages?
259	If it isn't going to change
259	the way you think,
261.56	what would the other reasons be?
263.72	There are some.
265.6	One of them is that if you
265.6	want to imbibe a culture,
271	if you want to drink it in,
271	if you want to become part of it,
274.16	then whether or not
274.16	the language channels the culture --
278.08	and that seems doubtful --
280.04	if you want to imbibe the culture,
281.88	you have to control to some degree
284.36	the language that the culture
284.36	happens to be conducted in.
287.72	There's no other way.
289.44	There's an interesting
289.44	illustration of this.
291.96	I have to go slightly obscure,
291.96	but really you should seek it out.
295.68	There's a movie by the Canadian
295.68	film director Denys Arcand --
300.04	read out in English on the page,
300.04	"""Dennis Ar-cand,"""
302.76	if you want to look him up.
304.12	"He did a film called ""Jesus of Montreal."""
307.2	And many of the characters
309.36	are vibrant, funny, passionate,
309.36	interesting French-Canadian,
314.44	French-speaking women.
315.8	There's one scene closest to the end,
318.28	where they have to take a friend
318.28	to an Anglophone hospital.
321.76	In the hospital,
321.76	they have to speak English.
323.88	Now, they speak English
323.88	but it's not their native language,
326.76	they'd rather not speak English.
328.48	And they speak it more slowly,
330.44	they have accents, they're not idiomatic.
332.44	Suddenly these characters
332.44	that you've fallen in love with
335.16	become husks of themselves,
335.16	they're shadows of themselves.
339.28	To go into a culture
341	and to only ever process people
341	through that kind of skrim curtain
345.04	is to never truly get the culture.
347.96	And so to the extent that hundreds
347.96	of languages will be left,
350.76	one reason to learn them
352.04	is because they are tickets
352.04	to being able to participate
355.76	in the culture of the people
355.76	who speak them,
358.04	just by virtue of the fact
358.04	that it is their code.
361.24	So that's one reason.
363.44	Second reason:
364.76	it's been shown
366.2	that if you speak two languages,
366.2	dementia is less likely to set in,
371.16	and that you are probably
371.16	a better multitasker.
374.52	And these are factors that set in early,
377.96	and so that ought to give you some sense
379.92	of when to give junior or juniorette
379.92	lessons in another language.
384.48	Bilingualism is healthy.
386.92	And then, third --
388.84	languages are just an awful lot of fun.
392.8	Much more fun than we're often told.
394.56	So for example,
394.56	"Arabic: ""kataba,"" he wrote,"
397.88	"""yaktubu,"" he writes, she writes."
401.12	"""Uktub,"" write, in the imperative."
404.16	What do those things have in common?
406.08	All those things have in common
408.2	the consonants sitting
408.2	in the middle like pillars.
411.76	They stay still,
413.24	and the vowels
413.24	dance around the consonants.
416.4	Who wouldn't want to roll
416.4	that around in their mouths?
419.6	You can get that from Hebrew,
421.04	you can get that from Ethiopia's
421.04	main language, Amharic.
424.72	That's fun.
426.16	Or languages have different word orders.
429.6	Learning how to speak
429.6	with different word order
431.84	is like driving on the different side
431.84	of a street if you go to certain country,
436.84	or the feeling that you get when you
436.84	put Witch Hazel around your eyes
441.36	and you feel the tingle.
442.72	A language can do that to you.
445.32	So for example,
446.56	"""The Cat in the Hat Comes Back,"""
448.6	a book that I'm sure
448.6	we all often return to,
451.12	"like ""Moby Dick."""
452.4	One phrase in it is,
452.4	"""Do you know where I found him?"
457.52	Do you know where he was?
457.52	He was eating cake in the tub,
460.2	"Yes he was!"""
461.44	Fine. Now, if you learn that
461.44	in Mandarin Chinese,
463.8	then you have to master,
465.08	"""You can know, I did where him find?"
467.36	He was tub inside gorging cake,
469.2	"No mistake gorging chewing!"""
471.04	That just feels good.
472.28	Imagine being able to do that
472.28	for years and years at a time.
476.6	Or, have you ever learned any Cambodian?
480.96	Me either, but if I did,
484	I would get to roll around in my mouth
484	not some baker's dozen of vowels
488.64	like English has,
489.92	but a good 30 different vowels
492.96	scooching and oozing around
492.96	in the Cambodian mouth
496.88	like bees in a hive.
499.24	That is what a language can get you.
502.44	And more to the point,
503.72	we live in an era when it's never been
503.72	easier to teach yourself another language.
507.68	It used to be that you had
507.68	to go to a classroom,
509.96	and there would be
509.96	some diligent teacher --
512.04	some genius teacher in there --
513.68	but that person was only
513.68	in there at certain times
516.04	and you had to go then,
517.32	and then was not most times.
519.16	You had to go to class.
520.974	If you didn't have that,
520.974	you had something called a record.
523.76	I cut my teeth on those.
525.48	There was only so much data on a record,
528.2	or a cassette,
529.48	or even that antique object known as a CD.
531.84	Other than that you had books
531.84	that didn't work,
534.48	that's just the way it was.
535.88	Today you can lay down --
538.8	lie on your living room floor,
541.28	sipping bourbon,
542.52	and teach yourself
542.52	any language that you want to
545.32	with wonderful sets
545.32	such as Rosetta Stone.
547.92	I highly recommend
547.92	the lesser known Glossika as well.
551.08	You can do it any time,
552.4	therefore you can do it more and better.
555.48	You can give yourself your morning
555.48	pleasures in various languages.
559.32	"I take some ""Dilbert"" in various"
559.32	languages every single morning;
563.08	it can increase your skills.
564.76	Couldn't have done it 20 years ago
566.64	when the idea of having
566.64	any language you wanted
570.2	in your pocket,
571.8	coming from your phone,
573.32	would have sounded like science fiction
573.32	to very sophisticated people.
577.8	So I highly recommend
580.36	that you teach yourself languages
580.36	other than the one that I'm speaking,
584.36	because there's never been
584.36	a better time to do it.
587.56	It's an awful lot of fun.
589.08	It won't change your mind,
590.92	but it will most certainly blow your mind.
594.12	Thank you very much.
595.36	(Applause)
