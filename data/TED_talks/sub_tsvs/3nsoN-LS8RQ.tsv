13.459	Here's a question we need to rethink together:
17.686	What should be the role of money
20.127	and markets in our societies?
23.613	Today, there are very few things
26.107	that money can't buy.
28.795	If you're sentenced to a jail term
30.452	in Santa Barbara, California,
32.903	you should know
34.255	that if you don't like the standard accommodations,
36.97	you can buy a prison cell upgrade.
41.313	It's true. For how much, do you think?
44.159	What would you guess?
46.1	Five hundred dollars?
47.805	It's not the Ritz-Carlton. It's a jail!
51.14	Eighty-two dollars a night.
53.164	Eighty-two dollars a night.
55.536	If you go to an amusement park
57.736	and don't want to stand in the long lines
60.428	for the popular rides,
61.884	there is now a solution.
64.771	In many theme parks, you can pay extra
69.035	to jump to the head of the line.
70.649	They call them Fast Track or VIP tickets.
75.164	And this isn't only happening in amusement parks.
78.753	In Washington, D.C., long lines,
81.969	queues sometimes form
83.909	for important Congressional hearings.
87.778	Now some people don't like to wait in long queues,
91.283	maybe overnight, even in the rain.
93.788	So now, for lobbyists and others
95.785	who are very keen to attend these hearings
97.591	but don't like to wait, there are companies,
100.31	line-standing companies,
102.353	and you can go to them.
104.216	You can pay them a certain amount of money,
106.105	they hire homeless people and others who need a job
109.37	to stand waiting in the line for as long as it takes,
112.653	and the lobbyist, just before the hearing begins,
115.521	can take his or her place at the head of the line
118.4	and a seat in the front of the room.
121.145	Paid line standing.
124.224	It's happening, the recourse to market mechanisms
127.806	and market thinking and market solutions,
130.48	in bigger arenas.
133.112	Take the way we fight our wars.
135.783	Did you know that, in Iraq and Afghanistan,
138.85	there were more private military contractors on the ground
142.895	than there were U.S. military troops?
146.715	Now this isn't because we had a public debate
149.834	about whether we wanted to outsource war
152.811	to private companies,
154.982	but this is what has happened.
157.689	Over the past three decades,
160.117	we have lived through a quiet revolution.
164.215	We've drifted almost without realizing it
169.182	from having a market economy
172.43	to becoming market societies.
176.397	The difference is this: A market economy is a tool,
179.982	a valuable and effective tool,
181.644	for organizing productive activity,
184.702	but a market society is a place where
187.76	almost everything is up for sale.
190.608	It's a way of life, in which market thinking
194.06	and market values begin to dominate
196.781	every aspect of life:
200.305	personal relations, family life, health, education,
205.04	politics, law, civic life.
208.339	Now, why worry? Why worry about our becoming
213.83	market societies?
216.376	For two reasons, I think.
219.48	One of them has to do with inequality.
224.161	The more things money can buy,
227.494	the more affluence, or the lack of it, matters.
231.788	If the only thing that money determined
234.645	was access to yachts or fancy vacations or BMWs,
240.334	then inequality wouldn't matter very much.
244.686	But when money comes increasingly to govern
248.113	access to the essentials of the good life --
252.95	decent health care, access to the best education,
256.876	political voice and influence in campaigns --
261.746	when money comes to govern all of those things,
265.326	inequality matters a great deal.
267.876	And so the marketization of everything
270.131	sharpens the sting of inequality
273.701	and its social and civic consequence.
275.885	That's one reason to worry.
278.871	There's a second reason
281.108	apart from the worry about inequality,
285.007	and it's this:
287.326	with some social goods and practices,
291.25	when market thinking and market values enter,
296.716	they may change the meaning of those practices
299.488	and crowd out attitudes and norms
302.837	worth caring about.
304.786	I'd like to take an example
307.41	of a controversial use of a market mechanism,
311.136	a cash incentive, and see what you think about it.
315.881	Many schools struggle with the challenge
319.046	of motivating kids, especially kids
321.585	from disadvantaged backgrounds, to study hard,
325.54	to do well in school, to apply themselves.
328.579	Some economists have proposed a market solution:
332.067	Offer cash incentives to kids for getting good grades
336.126	or high test scores
338.5	or for reading books.
340.451	They've tried this, actually.
342.233	They've done some experiments
343.518	in some major American cities.
346.949	In New York, in Chicago, in Washington, D.C.,
350.596	they've tried this, offering 50 dollars for an A,
356.499	In Dallas, Texas, they have a program that offers
359.673	eight-year-olds two dollars for each book they read.
364.093	So let's see what -- Some people are in favor,
367.012	some people are opposed to this cash incentive
370.402	to motivate achievement.
372.1	Let's see what people here think about it.
374.737	Imagine that you are the head of a major school system,
379.245	and someone comes to you with this proposal.
382.23	And let's say it's a foundation. They will provide the funds.
384.867	You don't have to take it out of your budget.
386.733	How many would be in favor
388.015	and how many would be opposed to giving it a try?
391.609	Let's see by a show of hands.
393.205	First, how many think it might at least be worth a try
396.799	to see if it would work? Raise your hand.
400.695	And how many would be opposed? How many would --
403.426	So the majority here are opposed,
406.24	but a sizable minority are in favor.
409.222	Let's have a discussion.
410.791	Let's start with those of you who object,
413.834	who would rule it out even before trying.
416.715	What would be your reason?
418.336	Who will get our discussion started? Yes?
422.208	Heike Moses: Hello everyone, I'm Heike,
424.106	and I think it just kills the intrinsic motivation,
426.873	so in the respect that children, if they would like to read,
432.021	you just take this incentive away
434.138	in just paying them, so it just changes behavior.
437.59	Michael Sandel: Takes the intrinsic incentive away.
441.008	What is, or should be, the intrinsic motivation?
445.243	HM: Well, the intrinsic motivation
446.933	should be to learn.
448.61	MS: To learn.
448.61	HM: To get to know the world.
451.753	And then, if you stop paying them, what happens then?
454.647	Then they stop reading?
456.394	MS: Now, let's see if there's someone who favors,
459.394	who thinks it's worth trying this.
461.742	Elizabeth Loftus: I'm Elizabeth Loftus,
463.714	and you said worth a try, so why not try it
467.844	and do the experiment and measure things?
471.967	MS: And measure. And what would you measure?
474.14	You'd measure how many --
475.861	EL: How many books they read
477.705	and how many books they continued to read
480.395	after you stopped paying them.
482.11	MS: Oh, after you stopped paying.
484.467	All right, what about that?
485.821	HM: To be frank, I just think
487.798	this is, not to offend anyone, a very American way.
492.431	(Laughter) (Applause)
498.903	MS: All right. What's emerged from this discussion
501.106	is the following question:
503.226	Will the cash incentive drive out or corrupt
507.477	or crowd out the higher motivation,
510.666	the intrinsic lesson that we hope to convey,
515.46	which is to learn to love to learn and to read
519.547	for their own sakes?
521.55	And people disagree about what the effect will be,
525.647	but that seems to be the question,
528.304	that somehow a market mechanism
530.34	or a cash incentive teaches the wrong lesson,
535.201	and if it does, what will become of these children later?
538.808	I should tell you what's happened with these experiments.
542.181	The cash for good grades has had very mixed results,
546.699	for the most part has not resulted in higher grades.
549.846	The two dollars for each book
552.217	did lead those kids to read more books.
555.518	It also led them to read shorter books.
558.162	(Laughter)
562.34	But the real question is,
563.99	what will become of these kids later?
566.562	Will they have learned that reading is a chore,
568.676	a form of piecework to be done for pay, that's the worry,
571.648	or may it lead them to read maybe for the wrong reason initially
576.265	but then lead them to fall in love with reading for its own sake?
581.011	Now, what this, even this brief debate, brings out
585.832	is something that many economists overlook.
589.65	Economists often assume
591.746	that markets are inert,
594.37	that they do not touch or taint the goods they exchange.
598.736	Market exchange, they assume,
601.84	doesn't change the meaning or value
604.3	of the goods being exchanged.
605.583	This may be true enough
607.159	if we're talking about material goods.
609.576	If you sell me a flat screen television
612.082	or give me one as a gift,
614.26	it will be the same good.
615.62	It will work the same either way.
618.106	But the same may not be true
620.882	if we're talking about nonmaterial goods
623.214	and social practices such as teaching and learning
627.164	or engaging together in civic life.
630.896	In those domains, bringing market mechanisms
634.317	and cash incentives may undermine
638.235	or crowd out nonmarket values and attitudes
642.555	worth caring about.
644.914	Once we see
647.138	that markets and commerce,
650.849	when extended beyond the material domain,
654.51	can change the character of the goods themselves,
659.96	can change the meaning of the social practices,
662.521	as in the example of teaching and learning,
665.985	we have to ask where markets belong
670.631	and where they don't,
672.562	where they may actually undermine
674.935	values and attitudes worth caring about.
677.938	But to have this debate,
681.2	we have to do something we're not very good at,
684.698	and that is to reason together in public
688.18	about the value and the meaning
691.42	of the social practices we prize,
695.424	from our bodies to family life
697.929	to personal relations to health
699.882	to teaching and learning to civic life.
703.595	Now these are controversial questions,
706.579	and so we tend to shrink from them.
709.339	In fact, during the past three decades,
712.259	when market reasoning and market thinking
714.756	have gathered force and gained prestige,
718.244	our public discourse during this time
721.726	has become hollowed out,
723.961	empty of larger moral meaning.
727.667	For fear of disagreement, we shrink from these questions.
730.879	But once we see that markets
734.406	change the character of goods,
736.579	we have to debate among ourselves
741.146	these bigger questions
743.483	about how to value goods.
745.443	One of the most corrosive effects
748.438	of putting a price on everything
751.225	is on commonality,
753.594	the sense that we are all in it together.
756.772	Against the background of rising inequality,
761.495	marketizing every aspect of life
765.362	leads to a condition where those who are affluent
770.913	and those who are of modest means
772.763	increasingly live separate lives.
777.145	We live and work and shop and play
780.364	in different places.
782.095	Our children go to different schools.
785.211	This isn't good for democracy,
787.76	nor is it a satisfying way to live,
790.683	even for those of us who can afford
793.963	to buy our way to the head of the line.
796.718	Here's why.
798.491	Democracy does not require perfect equality,
803.42	but what it does require
805.183	is that citizens share in a common life.
808.811	What matters is that people
811.44	of different social backgrounds
813.209	and different walks of life
814.933	encounter one another,
817.217	bump up against one another
819.24	in the ordinary course of life,
822.73	because this is what teaches us
825.454	to negotiate and to abide our differences.
829.126	And this is how we come to care for the common good.
833.34	And so, in the end, the question of markets
836.69	is not mainly an economic question.
840.83	It's really a question of how we want to live together.
844.918	Do we want a society where everything is up for sale,
849.458	or are there certain moral and civic goods
852.97	that markets do not honor
854.899	and money cannot buy?
857.693	Thank you very much.
859.155	(Applause)
