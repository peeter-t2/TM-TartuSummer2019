12.873	After decades of research
14.93	and billions of dollars
14.93	spent in clinical trials,
18.223	we still have a problem
18.223	with cancer drug delivery.
22.586	We still give patients chemotherapy,
24.754	which is so non-specific
26.611	that even though
26.611	it kills the cancer cells,
29.161	it kind of kills
29.161	the rest of your body, too.
32.494	And yes, we have developed
32.494	more selective drugs,
35.974	but it's still a challenge
35.974	to get them into the tumor,
38.701	and they end up accumulating
38.701	in the other organs as well
41.641	or passing through your urine,
43.296	which is a total waste.
46.389	And fields like mine have emerged
48.383	where we try to encapsulate these drugs
50.373	to protect them as they
50.373	travel through the body.
52.95	But these modifications cause problems
55.827	that we make more modifications to fix.
58.961	So what I'm really trying to say
58.961	is we need a better drug delivery system.
63.513	And I propose,
64.953	rather than using solely human design,
67.608	why not use nature's?
70.309	Immune cells are these versatile vehicles
70.309	that travel throughout our body,
74.187	patrolling for signs of disease
76.313	and arriving at a wound
76.313	mere minutes after injury.
80	So I ask you guys:
82.054	If immune cells are already traveling
82.054	to places of injury or disease
85.459	in our bodies,
86.636	why not add an extra passenger?
88.966	Why not use immune cells to deliver drugs
91.917	to cure some of our biggest problems
93.903	in disease?
96.446	I am a biomedical engineer,
98.379	and I want to tell you guys a story
98.379	about how I use immune cells
101.404	to target one of the largest
101.404	problems in cancer.
104.663	Did you know that over 90 percent
104.663	of cancer deaths
107.194	can be attributed to its spread?
108.969	So if we can stop these cancer cells
111.258	from going from the primary tumor
111.258	to a distant site,
114.356	we can stop cancer right in its tracks
116.856	and give people more of their lives back.
120.182	To do this special mission,
121.786	we decided to deliver
121.786	a nanoparticle made of lipids,
124.86	which are the same materials
124.86	that compose your cell membrane.
128.733	And we've added two special molecules.
131.952	One is called e-selectin,
134.153	which acts as a glue
135.453	that binds the nanoparticle
135.453	to the immune cell.
139.223	And the second one is called trail.
141.74	Trail is a therapeutic drug
141.74	that kills cancer cells
144.42	but not normal cells.
146.392	Now, when you put both of these together,
149.218	you have a mean killing machine on wheels.
155.589	To test this, we ran
155.589	an experiment in a mouse.
159.276	So what we did was we injected
159.276	the nanoparticles,
162.365	and they bound almost immediately
162.365	to the immune cells in the bloodstream.
166.406	And then we injected the cancer cells
166.406	to mimic a process
169.355	through which cancer cells
169.355	spread throughout our bodies.
172.53	And we found something very exciting.
175.62	We found that in our treated group,
178.314	over 75 percent of the cancer cells
178.314	we initially injected were dead or dying,
183.118	in comparison to only around 25 percent.
185.839	So just imagine: these fewer
185.839	amount of cells were available
189.045	to actually be able to spread
189.045	to a different part of the body.
192.181	And this is only after
192.181	two hours of treatment.
194.922	Our results were amazing,
194.922	and we had some pretty interesting press.
199.974	My favorite title was actually,
202.248	"""Sticky balls may stop"
202.248	"the spread of cancer."""
204.886	(Laughter)
206.003	I can't tell you just how smug
206.003	my male colleagues were,
210.035	knowing that their sticky balls
210.035	might one day cure cancer.
213.032	(Laughter)
215.354	But I can tell you they made
215.354	some pretty, pretty, exciting,
218.78	pretty ballsy t-shirts.
220.595	This was also my first experience
220.595	talking to patients
224.835	where they asked how soon
224.835	our therapy would be available.
228.279	And I keep these stories with me
228.279	to remind me of the importance
231.448	of the science,
231.448	the scientists and the patients.
235.809	Now, our fast-acting results
235.809	were pretty interesting,
238.374	but we still had one lingering question:
240.531	Can our sticky balls,
242.251	our particles actually attached
242.251	to the immune cells,
244.958	actually stop the spread of cancer?
247.624	So we went to our animal model,
247.624	and we found three important parts.
252.615	Our primary tumors were smaller
252.615	in our treated animals,
255.657	there were fewer cells in circulation,
258.199	and there was little to no
258.199	tumor burden in the distant organs.
262.835	Now, this wasn't just a victory
262.835	for us and our sticky balls.
266.737	This was also a victory to me
268.868	in drug delivery,
270.147	and it represents a paradigm shift,
272.102	a revolution --
274.33	to go from just using drugs,
274.33	just injecting them
277.734	and hoping they go to the right
277.734	places in the body,
280.211	to using immune cells
280.211	as special delivery drivers in your body.
285.975	For this example, we used two molecules,
285.975	e-selectin and trail,
289.715	but really, the possibility
289.715	of drugs you can use are endless.
293.523	And I talked about cancer,
295.941	but where disease goes,
295.941	so do immune cells.
299.6	So this could be used for any disease.
302.039	Imagine using immune cells
302.039	to deliver crucial wound-healing agents
306.742	after a spinal cord injury,
309.474	or using immune cells to deliver drugs
309.474	past the blood-brain barrier
313.895	to treat Parkinson's
313.895	or Alzheimer's disease.
317.044	These are the ideas that excite me
317.044	about science the most.
320.71	And from where I stand,
320.71	I see so much promise and opportunity.
324.181	Thank you.
325.395	(Applause)
