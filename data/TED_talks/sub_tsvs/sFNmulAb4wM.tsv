12.838	I think the beautiful Malin [Akerman] put it perfectly.
14.812	Every man deserves the opportunity
17.152	to grow a little bit of luxury.
19.775	Ladies and gentlemen, and more importantly,
21.605	Mo Bros and Mo Sistas&nbsp;— (Laughter) —
24.458	for the next 17 minutes, I'm going to share with you
26.994	my Movember journey, and how, through that journey,
30.645	we've redefined charity, we're redefining the way
33.816	prostate cancer researchers are working together
36.954	throughout the world, and I hope, through that process,
40.706	that I inspire you to create something significant
44.077	in your life, something significant that will go on
47.659	and make this world a better place.
51.242	So the most common question I get asked,
54.171	and I'm going to answer it now so I don't have to do it
56.359	over drinks tonight, is how did this come about?
60.832	How did Movember start?
63.395	Well, normally, a charity starts with the cause, and someone
66.132	that is directly affected by a cause.
69.194	They then go on to create an event, and beyond that,
72.378	a foundation to support that.
75.548	Pretty much in every case, that's how a charity starts.
80.251	Not so with Movember. Movember started in a very
83.682	traditional Australian way. It was on a Sunday afternoon.
87.46	I was with my brother and a mate having a few beers,
90.048	and I was watching the world go by,
92.219	had a few more beers, and the conversation turned
94.628	to '70s fashion — (Laughter)&nbsp;—
99	and how everything manages to come back into style.
101.908	"And a few more beers, I said, ""There has to be some stuff"
104.204	"that hasn't come back."" (Laughter)"
109.042	Then one more beer and it was, whatever happened to the mustache?
112.564	Why hasn't that made a comeback? (Laughter)
116.948	So then there was a lot more beers, and then the day ended
118.501	with a challenge to bring the mustache back. (Laughter)
123.711	"So in Australia, ""mo"" is slang for mustache,"
126.444	"so we renamed the month of November ""Movember"""
129.452	and created some pretty basic rules, which still stand today.
132.399	And they are: start the month clean-shaven,
135.166	rock a mustache -- not a beard, not a goatee, a mustache --
138.42	for the 30 days of November, and then we agreed
141.195	that we would come together at the end of the month,
143.697	have a mustache-themed party, and award a prize
147.709	for the best, and of course, the worst mustache. (Laughter)
152.531	Now trust me, when you're growing a mustache
154.005	back in 2003, and there were 30 of us back then,
157.21	and this was before the ironic hipster mustache movement
161.25	— (Laughter) —
165.714	it created a lot of controversy. (Laughter)
170.251	So my boss wouldn't let me go and see clients.
172.546	My girlfriend at the time, who's no longer my girlfriend — (Laughter) — hated it.
178.882	Parents would shuffle kids away from us. (Laughter)
184.542	But we came together at the end of the month and
185.989	we celebrated our journey, and it was a real journey.
189.277	And we had a lot of fun, and in 2004, I said to the guys,
194.049	"""That was so much fun. We need to legitimize this"
197.236	"so we can get away with it year on year."" (Laughter)"
202.019	So we started thinking about that, and we were inspired
205.858	by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer.
208.946	And we thought, you know what, there's nothing for men's health.
211.407	Why is that? Why can't we combine growing a mustache
215.32	and doing something for men's health?
216.812	And I started to research that topic, and discovered
219.476	prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer
222.39	in terms of the number of men that die from it and are diagnosed with it.
225.351	But there was nothing for this cause,
227.919	so we married growing a mustache with prostate cancer,
232.074	and then we created our tagline, which is,
234.18	"""Changing the face of men's health."""
236.189	And that eloquently describes the challenge,
238.928	changing your appearance for the 30 days,
241.039	and also the outcome that we're trying to achieve:
242.859	getting men engaged in their health, having them have
245.495	a better understanding about the health risks that they face.
249.799	So with that model, I then
252.479	cold-called the CEO of the Prostate Cancer Foundation.
255.158	"I said to him, ""I've got the most amazing idea"
257.525	"that's going to transform your organization."" (Laughter)"
260.719	And I didn't want to share with him the idea over the phone,
263.138	so I convinced him to meet with me for coffee in Melbourne
265.494	in 2004.
267.206	And we sat down, and I shared with him my vision
270.399	of getting men growing mustaches across Australia,
273.119	raising awareness for this cause,
275.831	and funds for his organization. And I needed a partnership
278.463	to legitimately do that.
281.04	"And I said, ""We're going to come together at the end,"
282.641	we're going to have a mustache-themed party, we're going to have DJs,
285.311	"we're going to celebrate life, and we're going to change the face of men's health."""
289.114	And he just looked at me and laughed, and he said,
291.891	"he said, ""Adam, that's a really novel idea,"
295.526	but we're an ultraconservative organization.
298.031	"We can't have anything to do with you."" (Laughter)"
302.847	So I paid for coffee that day — (Laughter) —
307.207	and his parting comment as we shook hands was,
310.21	"""Listen, if you happen to raise any money out of this,"
312.873	"we'll gladly take it."" (Laughter)"
317.427	So my lesson that year was persistence.
321.151	And we persisted, and we got 450 guys
325.551	growing mustaches, and together we raised 54,000 dollars,
330.719	and we donated every cent of that to the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia,
333.751	and that represented at the time the single biggest donation
336.857	they'd ever received.
339.413	So from that day forward, my life has become about a mustache.
344.014	Every day -- this morning, I wake up and go, my life
346.603	is about a mustache. (Laughter)
350.58	Essentially, I'm a mustache farmer. (Laughter)
355.563	And my season is November. (Applause)
358.828	(Applause)
361.919	So in 2005, the campaign got more momentum,
365.828	was more successful in Australia and then New Zealand,
368.269	and then in 2006 we came to a pivotal point.
373.027	It was consuming so much of our time after hours
376.764	on weekends that we thought, we either need
379.889	to close this down or figure a way to fund Movember
383.203	so that I could quit my job and go and spend more time
386.036	in the organization and take it to the next level.
389.866	It's really interesting when you try and figure a way
392.724	to fund a fundraising organization
394.865	built off growing mustaches. (Laughter)
397.32	Let me tell you that there's not too many people interested
399.691	in investing in that, not even the Prostate Cancer Foundation,
403.723	who we'd raised about 1.2 million dollars for at that stage.
406.988	So again we persisted, and Foster's Brewing came to the party
411.123	and gave us our first ever sponsorship,
414.263	and that was enough for me to quit my job, I did consulting on the side.
418.836	And leading into Movember 2006,
423.802	we'd run through all the money from Foster's,
426.387	we'd run through all the money I had, and essentially
429.545	we had no money left, and we'd convinced all our suppliers --
432.643	creative agencies, web development agencies,
434.836	hosting companies, whatnot -- to delay their billing until December.
439.289	So we'd racked up at this stage about 600,000 dollars
442.319	worth of debt. So if Movember 2006 didn't happen,
446.574	the four founders, well, we would've been broke,
449.944	we would've been homeless, sitting on the street
451.637	with mustaches. (Laughter)
454.495	But we thought, you know what, if that's the worst thing
456.4	that happens, so what?
458.645	We're going to have a lot of fun doing it, and it taught us
460.407	the importance of taking risks and really smart risks.
464.905	Then in early 2007, a really interesting thing happened.
469.168	We had Mo Bros from Canada, from the U.S.,
472.887	and from the U.K. emailing us and calling us and saying,
475.831	hey, there's nothing for prostate cancer.
477.815	Bring this campaign to these countries.
481.317	So we thought, why not? Let's do it.
483.679	So I cold-called the CEO of Prostate Cancer Canada,
486.809	"and I said to him, ""I have this most amazing concept."""
490.335	(Laughter)
492.103	"""It's going to transform your organization. I don't want"
495.15	to tell you about it now, but will you meet with me
496.614	"if I fly all the way to Toronto?"" So I flew here,"
500.023	met down on Front Street East, and we sat in the boardroom,
503.151	"and I said, ""Right, here's my vision of getting men growing mustaches"
507.228	"all across Canada raising awareness and funds for your organization."""
511.999	And he looked at me and laughed and said,
513.24	"""Adam, sounds like a really novel idea, but we're"
515.598	"an ultraconservative organization."" (Laughter)"
518.493	I've heard this before. I know how it goes.
521.5	"But he said, ""We will partner with you,"
523.974	but we're not going to invest in it. You need to figure
527.192	"a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work."""
530.063	So what we did was, we took some of the money that
531.976	we raised in Australia to bring the campaign across
534.079	to this country, the U.S, and the U.K., and we did that
536.68	because we knew, if this was successful,
539.136	we could raise infinitely more money globally
541.744	than we could just in Australia. And that money
544.279	fuels research, and that research will get us to a cure.
547.365	And we're not about finding an Australian cure
549.119	or a Canadian cure, we're about finding the cure.
553.498	So in 2007, we brought the campaign across here,
557.806	and it was, it set the stage for the campaign.
562.351	It wasn't as successful as we thought it would be.
564.384	We were sort of very gung ho with our success in Australia
567.034	and New Zealand at that stage.
569.855	So that year really taught us the importance of being patient
573.359	and really understanding the local market before you
575.647	become so bold as to set lofty targets.
579.295	But what I'm really pleased to say is, in 2010,
583.319	Movember became a truly global movement.
585.923	Canada was just pipped to the post in terms of
588.199	the number one fundraising campaign in the world.
590.871	Last year we had 450,000 Mo Bros spread across the world
596.003	and together we raised 77 million dollars.
600.055	(Applause)
607.963	And that makes Movember now the biggest funder
610.302	of prostate cancer research and support programs in the world.
614.545	And that is an amazing achievement when you think about
616.894	us growing mustaches. (Laughter)
620.63	And for us, we have redefined charity.
622.646	Our ribbon is a hairy ribbon. (Laughter)
628.022	Our ambassadors are the Mo Bros and the Mo Sistas,
630.379	and I think that's been fundamental to our success.
633.574	We hand across our brand and our campaign to those people.
637.678	We let them embrace it and interpret it in their own way.
641.622	So now I live in Los Angeles, because
644.221	the Prostate Cancer Foundation of the U.S. is based there,
646.99	and I always get asked by the media down there,
649.518	because it's so celebrity-driven,
652.054	"""Who are your celebrity ambassadors?"""
654.821	"And I say to them, ""Last year we were fortunate enough"
657.622	"to have 450,000 celebrity ambassadors."""
661.084	"And they go, ""What, what do you mean?"""
662.324	And it's like, everything single person, every single Mo Bro
665.286	and Mo Sista that participates in Movember
667.877	is our celebrity ambassador, and that is so, so important
671.367	and fundamental to our success.
674.286	Now what I want to share with you is
676.958	one of my most touching Movember moments,
680.958	and it happened here in Toronto last year,
683.798	at the end of the campaign.
686.278	I was out with a team. It was the end of Movember.
689.719	We'd had a great campaign, and to be honest, we'd had
692.472	our fair share of beer that night, but I said,
695.246	"""You know what, I think we've got one more bar left in us."" (Laughter)"
698.713	So we piled into a taxi, and this is our taxi driver,
702.118	and I was sitting in the back seat, and he turned around
704.31	"and said, ""Where are you going?"""
705.854	"And I said, ""Hang on, that is an amazing mustache."""
708.936	(Laughter)
713.343	"And he said, ""I'm doing it for Movember."" And I said,"
715.279	"""So am I."" And I said, ""Tell me your Movember story."""
719.589	"And he goes, ""Listen, I know it's about men's health,"
721.565	"I know it's about prostate cancer, but this is for breast cancer."""
724.627	"And I said, ""Okay, that's interesting."""
726.275	"And he goes, ""Last year, my mom passed away from breast cancer in Sri Lanka,"
729.832	"because we couldn't afford proper treatment for her,"""
733.198	"and he said, ""This mustache is my tribute to my mom."""
737.51	And we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi,
740.338	and I didn't tell him who I was, because I didn't think it was appropriate,
742.871	"and I just shook his hand and I said, ""Thank you so much."
744.814	"Your mom would be so proud."""
746.158	And from that moment I realized that Movember
748.086	is so much more than a mustache, having a joke.
751.124	It's about each person coming to this platform,
754.833	embracing it in their own way,
756.963	and being significant in their own life.
760.036	For us now at Movember, we really focus on
765.311	three program areas, and having a true impact:
769.583	awareness and education,
772	survivor support programs, and research.
774.787	Now we always focus, naturally, on how much we raise,
778.332	because it's a very tangible outcome, but for me,
781.453	awareness and education is more important than the funds we raise,
785.66	because I know that is changing and saving lives today,
788.524	and it's probably best exampled by
790.806	a young guy that I met at South by Southwest
793.636	in Austin, Texas, at the start of the year.
796.476	"He came up to me and said, ""Thank you for starting Movember."""
799.5	"And I said, ""Thank you for doing Movember."""
801.432	"And I looked at him, and I was like, ""I'm pretty sure you can't grow a mustache."" (Laughter)"
805.292	"And I said, ""What's your Movember story?"""
807.676	"And he said, ""I grew the worst mustache ever."" (Laughter)"
811.699	"""But I went home for Thanksgiving dinner, and pretty quickly"
814.269	the conversation around the table turned to
816.269	"what the hell was going on."" (Laughter)"
819.6	"""And we talked -- I talked to them about Movember,"
823.748	and then after that, my dad came up to me, and at the age
826.093	of 26, for the first time ever, I had a conversation with my dad
830.164	one on one about men's health. I had a conversation
833.265	with my dad about prostate cancer, and I learned
836.388	that my grandfather had prostate cancer
839.174	and I was able to share with my dad that he was
842.357	twice as likely to get that disease, and he didn't know that,
845.38	"and he hadn't been getting screened for it."""
847.45	So now, that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer.
850.947	So those conversations, getting men engaged in this,
853.537	at whatever age, is so critically important,
856.332	and in my view so much more important
858.354	than the funds we raise.
861.469	Now to the funds we raise, and research,
864.269	and how we're redefining research.
866.946	We fund prostate cancer foundations now in 13 countries.
871.584	We literally fund hundreds if not thousands of institutions
874.989	and researchers around the world, and when we looked
877.799	at this more recently, we realized there's a real lack
882.172	of collaboration going on even within institutions,
886.331	let alone nationally, let alone globally, and this is not unique
888.684	to prostate cancer. This is cancer research the world over.
892.104	And so we said, right, we'd redefined charity. We need
895.722	to redefine the way these guys operate. How do we do that?
899.773	So what we did was, we created a global action plan,
903.382	and we're taking 10 percent of what's raised in each country
905.199	now and putting it into a global fund, and we've got
907.541	the best prostate cancer scientific minds in the world
910.277	that look after that fund,
912.84	and they come together each year and identify
914.949	the number one priority,
917.936	and that, last year, was getting a better screening test.
921.832	So they identified that as a priority, and then
923.989	they've got and recruited now 300 researchers
926.618	from around the world that are studying that topic,
929.302	essentially the same topic.
931.253	So now we're funding them to the tune of about
933.014	five or six million dollars to collaborate
935.797	and bringing them together, and that's a unique thing
938.405	in the cancer world, and we know, through that collaboration,
941.381	it will accelerate outcomes.
944.773	And that's how we're redefining the research world.
951.033	So, what I know about my Movember journey is that,
957.677	with a really creative idea,
960.819	with passion, with persistence, and a lot of patience,
965.236	four mates, four mustaches,
968.266	can inspire a room full of people,
970.589	and that room full of people can go on and inspire a city,
973.502	and that city is Melbourne, my home.
975.702	And that city can go on and inspire a state, and that state
978.965	can go on and inspire a nation, and beyond that,
982.538	you can create a global movement
985.381	that is changing the face of men's health.
987.75	My name is Adam Garone, and that's my story.
990.125	Thank you. (Applause)
