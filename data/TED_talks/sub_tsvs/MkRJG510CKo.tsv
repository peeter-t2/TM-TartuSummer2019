16.045	So I am a surgeon who studies creativity,
18.542	and I have never had a patient tell me,
21.394	"""I really want you"
21.394	"to be creative during surgery,"""
24.26	and so I guess
24.26	there's a little bit of irony to it.
27.403	I will say though that,
27.403	after having done surgery a lot,
30.727	it's similar to playing
30.727	a musical instrument.
32.961	And for me, this deep
32.961	and enduring fascination with sound
35.815	is what led me to both be a surgeon
37.581	and to study the science
37.581	of sound, particularly music.
40.139	I'm going to talk
40.139	over the next few minutes
42.212	about my career
43.527	in terms of how I'm able to study music
45.835	and try to grapple
45.835	with all these questions
47.893	of how the brain is able to be creative.
50.26	I've done most of this work
50.26	at Johns Hopkins University,
52.914	and at the National Institute
52.914	of Health where I was previously.
55.923	I'll go over some science experiments
55.923	and cover three musical experiments.
59.454	I will start off by playing
59.454	a video for you.
61.534	This video is of Keith Jarrett,
61.534	who's a well-known jazz improviser
64.661	and probably the most
64.661	well-known, iconic example
67.129	of someone who takes improvisation
67.129	to a higher level.
69.646	And he'll improvise entire concerts
69.646	off the top of his head,
72.809	and he'll never play it
72.809	exactly the same way again,
75.238	so as a form of intense creativity,
77.247	I think this is a great example.
78.889	And so why don't we go
78.889	and click the video.
81.26	(Music)
137.055	(Music ends)
139.08	It's really a remarkable
139.08	thing that happens there.
141.443	I've always as a listener, as a fan,
143.195	I listen to that, and I'm astounded.
144.936	I think -- how can this possibly be?
146.696	How can the brain generate
146.696	that much information,
149.011	that much music, spontaneously?
150.62	And so I set out
150.62	with this concept, scientifically,
153.26	that artistic creativity,
153.26	it's magical, but it's not magic,
157.635	meaning that it's a product of the brain.
159.666	There's not too many brain-dead
159.666	people creating art.
162.124	With this notion that artistic creativity
162.124	is in fact a neurologic product,
165.779	I took this thesis that we could study it
168.26	just like we study any other
168.26	complex neurologic process,
171.398	and there are subquestions
171.398	that I put there.
173.477	Is it possible to study
173.477	creativity scientifically?
175.887	And I think that's a good question.
177.948	And I'll tell you that most
177.948	scientific studies of music,
180.658	they're very dense,
182.2	and when you go through them,
183.619	it's very hard to recognize
183.619	the music in it.
185.713	In fact, they seem to be
185.713	unmusical entirely
187.956	and to miss the point of the music.
189.774	This brings the second question:
191.354	Why should scientists study creativity?
193.26	Maybe we're not the right people to do it.
195.363	(Laughter)
196.386	Well it may be, but I will say that,
196.386	from a scientific perspective,
199.862	we talked a lot about innovation today,
201.904	the science of innovation,
203.26	how much we understand
203.26	about how the brain is able to innovate
206.237	is in its infancy,
207.505	and truly, we know very little
207.505	about how we are able to be creative.
210.996	I think that we're going to see,
212.544	over the next 10, 20, 30 years,
214.26	a real science of creativity
214.26	that's burgeoning
216.455	and is going to flourish,
217.68	Because we now have new methods
217.68	that can enable us
220.136	to take this process
220.136	like complex jazz improvisation,
222.684	and study it rigorously.
224.082	So it gets down to the brain.
226.253	All of us have this remarkable brain,
228.071	which is poorly understood,
228.071	to say the least.
230.55	I think that neuroscientists
230.55	have more questions than answers,
234.772	and I'm not going
234.772	to give you answers today,
236.998	just ask a lot of questions.
238.383	And that's what I do in my lab.
239.914	I ask questions about what is the brain
239.914	doing to enable us to do this.
243.252	This is the main method that I use.
243.252	This is functional MRI.
246.053	If you've been in an MRI scanner,
246.053	it's very much the same,
248.8	but this one is outfitted in a special way
248.8	to not just take pictures of your brain,
252.739	but to also take pictures
252.739	of active areas of the brain.
255.69	The way that's done is by the following:
257.619	There's something called BOLD imaging,
259.453	which is Blood Oxygen
259.453	Level Dependent imaging.
262.541	When you're in an fMRI scanner,
262.541	you're in a big magnet
265.15	that's aligning your molecules
265.15	in certain areas.
267.547	When an area of the brain is active,
267.547	meaning a neural area is active,
271.29	it gets blood flow shunted to that area.
273.552	That blood flow causes an increase
273.552	in local blood to that area
277.926	with a deoxyhemoglobin
277.926	change in concentration.
280.933	Deoxyhemoglobin can be detected by MRI,
283.112	whereas oxyhemoglobin can't.
284.986	So through this method of inference --
286.964	and we're measuring blood flow,
286.964	not neural activity --
289.53	we say that an area of the brain
289.53	that's getting more blood
292.29	was active during a particular task,
292.29	and that's the crux of how fMRI works.
295.856	And it's been used since the '90s
295.856	to study really complex processes.
299.785	I'm going to review a study that I did,
299.785	which was jazz in an fMRI scanner.
303.309	It was done with a colleague,
303.309	Alan Braun, at the NIH.
305.836	This is a short video
305.836	of how we did this project.
308.26	(Video) Charles Limb: This is a plastic
308.26	MIDI piano keyboard
311.065	that we use for the jazz experiments.
312.87	And it's a 35-key keyboard
314.947	designed to fit both inside the scanner,
317.431	be magnetically safe,
318.791	have minimal interference
318.791	that would contribute to any artifact,
322.657	and have this cushion
322.657	so that it can rest on the players' legs
325.601	while they're lying down in the scanner,
325.601	playing on their back.
328.58	It works like this --
328.58	this doesn't actually produce any sound.
331.633	It sends out what's called
331.633	a MIDI signal --
334.1	or a Musical Instrument
334.1	Digital Interface --
336.173	through these wires into the box
336.173	and then the computer,
338.858	which then trigger
338.858	high-quality piano samples like this.
341.817	(Music)
348.309	(Music)
367.593	(Music ends)
369.592	OK, so it works.
371.26	And so through this piano keyboard,
373.26	we have the means to take
373.26	a musical process and study it.
376.027	So what do you do now that you have
376.027	this cool piano keyboard?
378.978	You can't just say,
378.978	"""It's great we have a keyboard."""
381.447	We have to come up
381.447	with a scientific experiment.
383.795	The experiment
383.795	really rests on the following:
386.189	What happens in the brain during something
386.189	that's memorized and over-learned,
389.857	and what happens in the brain
389.857	during something
392.036	that is spontaneously
392.036	generated, or improvised,
394.334	in a way that's matched motorically
396.172	and in terms of lower-level
396.172	sensory motor features?
399.041	I have here what we call the paradigms.
401.66	There's a scale paradigm, which is playing
401.66	a scale up and down, memorized,
405.18	then there's improvising on a scale,
406.938	quarter notes, metronome, right hand --
408.999	scientifically very safe,
410.594	but musically really boring.
412.491	Then there's the bottom one,
412.491	which is called the jazz paradigm.
415.486	So we brought professional
415.486	jazz players to the NIH,
417.914	and we had them memorize
417.914	this piece of music on the lower-left,
420.891	which is what you heard me playing --
422.733	and we had them improvise
422.733	to the same chord changes.
425.25	And if you can hit
425.25	that lower-right sound icon,
427.482	that's an example
427.482	of what was recorded in the scanner.
430.334	(Music)
455.064	(Music ends)
457.089	In the end, it's not the most
457.089	natural environment,
459.529	but they're able to play real music.
461.459	And I've listened to that solo 200 times,
463.454	and I still like it.
464.655	And the musicians
464.655	were comfortable in the end.
467.066	We first measured the number of notes.
468.914	Were they playing more notes
468.914	when they were improvising?
471.595	That was not what was going on.
473.209	And then we looked at the brain activity.
475.218	I will try to condense this for you.
477.05	These are contrast maps that are showing
477.05	subtractions between what changes
480.554	when you're improvising
480.554	vs. when you're doing something memorized.
483.674	In red is an area that's active
483.674	in the prefrontal cortex,
486.483	the frontal lobe of the brain,
487.966	and in blue is this area
487.966	that was deactivated.
490.169	So we had this focal area
490.169	called the medial prefrontal cortex
493.069	that went way up in activity.
494.48	We had this broad patch of area
494.48	called the lateral prefrontal cortex
497.734	that went way down in activity,
499.283	I'll summarize that for you.
500.795	These are multifunctional
500.795	areas of the brain,
502.927	these are not the jazz areas of the brain.
505.106	They do a whole host of things
507.058	that have to do with self-reflection,
508.941	introspection, working memory etc.
511.325	Really, consciousness is seated
511.325	in the frontal lobe.
513.836	But we have this combination
515.894	of an area that's thought to be involved
515.894	in self-monitoring, turning off,
519.367	and this area that's thought
519.367	to be autobiographical,
521.854	or self-expressive, turning on.
523.413	We think, at least in this preliminary --
525.508	it's one study; it's probably wrong,
525.508	but it's one study --
528.285	(Laughter)
529.348	we think that at least
529.348	a reasonable hypothesis
532.103	is that, to be creative,
533.288	you should have this weird dissociation
533.288	in your frontal lobe.
536.188	One area turns on,
536.188	and a big area shuts off,
538.736	so that you're not inhibited,
538.736	you're willing to make mistakes,
541.698	so that you're not constantly
541.698	shutting down
543.89	all of these new generative impulses.
545.839	Now a lot of people know that music
545.839	is not always a solo activity --
549.308	sometimes it's done communicatively.
551.052	The next question was:
552.26	What happens when musicians
552.26	are trading back and forth,
554.856	"something called ""trading fours,"""
556.493	which is something they do
556.493	normally in a jazz experiment.
559.34	So this is a 12-bar blues,
560.777	and I've broken it
560.777	down into four-bar groups,
562.91	so you would know how you would trade.
564.746	We brought a musician
564.746	into the scanner, same way,
567.056	had them memorize this melody
568.492	then had another musician
568.492	out in the control room
571.082	trading back and forth interactively.
573.075	So this is a musician, Mike Pope,
575.723	one of the world's best bassists
575.723	and a fantastic piano player.
578.833	(Music)
585.116	He's now playing the piece
585.116	that we just saw
587.506	a little better than I wrote it.
589.26	(Video) CL: Mike, come on in.
591.05	Mike Pope: May the force be with you.
592.844	Nurse: Nothing in your pockets, Mike?
594.634	MP: No. Nothing's in my pockets.
605.837	CL: You have to have the right
605.837	attitude to agree to do it.
608.639	(Laughter)
609.919	It's kind of fun, actually.
611.758	(Music)
613.381	Now we're playing back and forth.
615.104	He's in there.
615.104	You can see his legs up there.
617.34	(Music)
618.706	And then I'm in the control room here,
618.706	playing back and forth.
621.92	(Music)
631.39	(Music ends)
633.26	(Video) Mike Pope:
633.26	This is a pretty good representation
636.628	of what it's like.
638.436	And it's good that it's not too quick.
640.46	The fact that we do it over and over again
643.063	lets you acclimate to your surroundings.
647.293	So the hardest thing for me
647.293	was the kinesthetic thing,
649.975	looking at my hands through two mirrors,
653.26	laying on my back,
655.26	and not able to move at all
655.26	except for my hand.
657.962	That was challenging.
659.858	But again --
662.212	there were moments, for sure --
665.022	(Laughter)
666.047	there were moments of real, honest-to-God
666.047	musical interplay, for sure.
671.046	CL: At this point,
671.046	I'll take a few moments.
673.072	So what you're seeing here --
674.977	and I'm doing a cardinal sin in science,
677.078	which is to show you preliminary data.
678.912	This is one subject's data.
680.689	This is, in fact, Mike Pope's data.
682.46	So what am I showing you here?
683.96	When he was trading fours with me,
683.96	improvising vs. memorized,
688.095	his language areas lit up,
688.095	his Broca's area,
690.868	in the inferior frontal gyrus on the left.
692.954	He had it also homologous on the right.
694.887	This is an area thought to be
694.887	involved in expressive communication.
698.07	This whole notion
698.07	that music is a language --
700.222	maybe there's a neurologic
700.222	basis to it after all,
702.545	and we can see it when two musicians
702.545	are having a musical conversation.
705.923	So we've done this on eight subjects now,
707.92	and we're getting all the data together,
709.873	hopefully we'll have something
709.873	to say about it meaningfully.
712.722	Now when I think about improvisation
712.722	and the language, what's next?
715.989	Rap, of course, rap -- freestyle.
718.26	I've always been fascinated by freestyle.
721.031	And let's play this video.
722.568	(Video) Mos Def: Brown skin I be,
722.568	standing five-ten I be
725.43	Rockin' it when I be, in your vicinity
727.476	Whole-style synergy, recognize symmetry
730.52	Go and try to injure me,
730.52	broke 'em down chemically
732.878	Ain't the number 10 MC,
732.878	talk about how been I be
735.331	Styled it like Kennedy,
735.331	late like a 10 to three
737.753	When I say when I be,
737.753	girls say bend that key cut
740.595	CL: So there's a lot of analogy
742.437	between what takes place
742.437	in freestyle rap and jazz.
744.917	There are a lot of correlates
744.917	between the two forms of music,
747.858	I think, in different time periods,
747.858	in lot of ways,
750.329	rap serves the same social function
750.329	that jazz used to serve.
753.184	So how do you study rap scientifically?
755.101	And my colleagues think I'm crazy,
755.101	but I think it's very viable.
758.26	This is what you do:
759.511	You have a freestyle artist come
759.511	and memorize a rap
762.282	that you write for them,
763.527	that they've never heard before,
763.527	and then you have them freestyle.
766.983	So I told my lab members
766.983	that I would rap for TED,
769.425	"and they said, ""No, you won't."""
771.091	And then I thought --
772.318	(Laughter)
773.658	(Applause)
779.408	But here's the thing.
780.712	With this big screen,
780.712	you can all rap with me. OK?
783.637	So what we had them do
785.505	was memorize this lower-left
785.505	sound icon, please.
788.125	This is the control condition.
788.125	This is what they memorized.
791.042	Computer: Memory, thump.
793.099	CL: Thump of the beat in a known repeat
795.26	Rhythm and rhyme, they make me complete
798.26	The climb is sublime when I'm on the mic
800.38	Spittin' rhymes that hit you
800.38	like a lightning strike
802.96	Computer: Search.
804.148	CL: I search for the truth
804.148	in this eternal quest
806.516	My passion's not fashion,
806.516	you can see how I'm dressed
809.27	Psychopathic words in my head appear
811.26	Whisper these lyrics only I can hear
813.522	Computer: Art.
814.718	CL: The art of discovering
814.718	and that which is hovering
817.372	Inside the mind of those unconfined
819.26	All of these words keep
819.26	pouring out like rain
822.26	I need a mad scientist to check my brain
825.019	Computer: Stop.
826.35	(Applause)
835.53	I guarantee you
835.53	that will never happen again.
837.728	(Laughter)
839.693	So now, what's great
839.693	about these free-stylers,
841.905	they will get cued different words.
843.791	They don't know what's coming,
845.259	but they'll hear something off the cuff.
847.199	Go hit that right sound icon,
848.632	there will be cued three square words:
848.632	like, not and head.
851.376	He doesn't know what's coming.
851.376	Computer: Like.
853.554	Freestyler: I'm like some kind of
855.348	extraterrestrial, celestial scene
857.601	Back in the days, I used to sit
857.601	in pyramids and meditate
860.462	With two microphones -- Computer: Head
862.659	hovering over my head
864.017	See if I could still listen,
865.404	spittin' off the sound
866.715	See what you grinning
867.924	I teach the children
867.924	in the back of the classroom
870.373	About the message of apocalyptical
872.794	Computer: Not.
873.978	Not really though,
873.978	'cause I've got to keep it simple
876.63	instrumental
878.26	Detrimental playing Super Mario
881.26	boxes [unclear] hip hop
884.437	Computer: Stop.
885.881	CL: It's an incredible
885.881	thing that's taking place.
888.216	It's doing something
888.216	neurologically remarkable.
890.466	Whether or not you like
890.466	the music is irrelevant.
892.806	Creatively speaking,
892.806	it's just a phenomenal thing.
895.231	This is a short video
895.231	of how we do this in a scanner.
897.771	[fMRI of Hip-Hop Rap]
899.31	(Laughter)
900.47	(Video) CL: We're here with Emmanuel.
902.268	CL: That was recorded
902.268	in the scanner, by the way.
904.598	(Video) CL: That's Emmanuel
904.598	in the scanner.
907.26	He's just memorized a rhyme for us.
910.302	[Control Condition Memorized Verses]
913.009	Emmanuel: Top of the beat with no repeat
915.26	Rhythm and rhyme make me complete
918.26	Climb is sublime when I'm on the mic
921.26	Spittin' rhymes that'll hit you
921.26	like a lightning strike
924.058	Computer: Search.
925.24	I search for the truth
925.24	in this eternal quest
927.524	I'm passing on fashion;
927.524	you can see how I'm dressed
930.124	CL: I'm going to stop that there;
930.124	so what do we see in his brain?
933.211	This is four rappers' brains.
934.893	And we do see language areas lighting up,
936.953	but then, eyes closed --
938.26	when you are freestyling vs. memorizing,
941.597	you've got major visual areas lighting up.
943.775	You've got major cerebellar activity,
943.775	which is involved in motor coordination.
947.488	You have heightened brain activity
947.488	when you're doing a comparable task,
950.868	when that one task is creative
950.868	and the other task is memorized.
953.85	It's very preliminary,
953.85	but I think it's kind of cool.
956.658	To conclude, we've got
956.658	a lot of questions to ask,
958.99	and like I said, we'll ask questions
958.99	here, not answer them.
961.919	But we want to get at the root
961.919	of what is creative genius neurologically,
965.394	and I think, with these methods,
965.394	we're getting close.
967.975	And I think, hopefully
967.975	in the next 10, 20 years,
970.302	you'll see real, meaningful studies
972.223	that say science has to catch up to art,
975.26	and maybe we're starting now to get there.
977.672	Thank you for your time, I appreciate it.
979.694	(Applause)
