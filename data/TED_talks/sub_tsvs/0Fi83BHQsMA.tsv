12.813	So, I thought a lot about
12.813	the first word I'd say today,
15.641	"and I decided to say ""Colombia."""
18.155	And the reason, I don't know
18.155	how many of you have visited Colombia,
22.214	but Colombia is just north
22.214	of the border with Brazil.
25.064	It's a beautiful country
26.271	with extraordinary people,
26.271	like me and others -- (Laughter) --
29.727	and it's populated
29.727	with incredible fauna, flora.
35.157	It's got water; it's got everything
35.157	to be the perfect place.
39.324	But we have a few problems.
41.052	You may have heard of some of them.
42.722	We have the oldest
42.722	standing guerrilla in the world.
46.415	It's been around for over 50 years,
48.414	which means that in my lifetime,
51.177	I have never lived one day 
51.177	of peace in my country.
55.852	This guerrilla -- and the main group
55.852	is the FARC guerrillas,
59.725	Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia --
62.142	they have financed their war
62.142	by kidnapping, by extortion,
69.631	by getting into the drug trade,
69.631	by illegal mining.
73.48	There has been terrorism.
73.48	There have been random bombs.
77.301	So it's not good.
77.301	It's not really good.
81.576	And if you look at the human cost
81.576	of this war over 50 years,
86.376	we have had more than
86.376	5.7 million displaced population.
91.197	It's one of the biggest displaced
91.197	populations in the world,
94.265	and this conflict has cost
94.265	over 220,000 lives.
98.374	So it's a little bit like
98.374	the Bol√≠var wars again.
101.432	It's a lot of people who
101.432	have died unnecessarily.
104.587	We are now in the middle of peace talks,
107.665	and we've been trying to help
107.665	resolve this problem peacefully,
110.958	and as part of that,
112.518	we decided to try something
112.518	completely lateral and different:
116.427	Christmas lights.
118.471	So Christmas lights, and you're saying,
120.977	what the hell is this guy
120.977	going to talk about?
124.173	I am going to talk about gigantic trees
128.785	that we put in nine strategic 
128.785	pathways in the jungle
134.412	covered with Christmas lights.
136.421	These trees helped us 
136.421	demobilize 331 guerrillas,
142.599	roughly five percent
142.599	of the guerrilla force at the time.
147.097	These trees were lit up at night,
149.675	and they had a sign beside them
152.044	"that said, ""If Christmas can come"
152.044	to the jungle, you can come home.
156.735	Demobilize.
158.435	"At Christmas, everything is possible."""
160.916	So how do we know these trees worked?
164.209	Well, we got 331, which is okay,
166.215	but we also know that
166.215	not a lot of guerrillas saw them,
171.48	but we know that a lot of
171.48	guerrillas heard about them,
173.984	and we know this
175.191	because we are constantly talking
175.191	to demobilized guerrillas.
178.295	So let me take you back
178.295	four years before the trees.
181.05	Four years before the trees,
181.05	we were approached by the government
184.735	to help them come up with
184.735	a communications strategy
188.882	to get as many guerrillas
188.882	as we could out of the jungle.
192.082	The government had a military strategy,
194.534	it had a legal strategy,
195.862	it had a political strategy, but it said,
198.691	"""We don't really have"
198.691	a communications strategy,
201.036	and it probably would be
201.036	"a good thing to have,"""
203.987	so we decided to
203.987	immediately jump into this,
208.373	because it is an opportunity
208.373	to affect the outcome of the conflict
213.588	with the things that we do,
213.588	with the tools that we have.
218.264	But we didn't know very much about it.
220.493	We didn't understand in Colombia, 
220.493	if you live in the cities,
223.709	you're very far away from where 
223.709	the war is actually happening,
226.803	so you don't really understand it,
228.816	and we asked the government 
228.816	to give us access
230.982	to as many demobilized
230.982	guerrillas as possible.
233.524	And we talked to about 60 of them
235.98	before we felt we fully
235.98	understood the problem.
241.074	We talked about -- they told us why 
241.074	they had joined the guerrillas,
244.386	why the left the guerrillas,
244.386	what their dreams were,
247.025	what their frustrations were,
248.713	and from those conversations
248.713	came the underlying insight
253.173	that has guided this whole campaign,
255.67	which is that guerrillas are as much
255.67	prisoners of their organizations
261.06	as the people they hold hostage.
263.533	And at the beginning, we were
263.533	so touched by these stories,
266.313	we were so amazed by these stories,
268.596	that we thought that maybe 
268.596	the best way to talk to the guerrillas
271.735	was to have them talk to themselves,
274.57	so we recorded about a hundred
274.57	different stories during the first year,
279.354	and we put them on
279.354	the radio and television
281.722	so that the guerrillas in the jungle
281.722	could hear stories, their stories,
286.067	or stories similar to theirs,
288.415	and when they heard them,
288.415	they decided to go out.
291.195	I want to tell you one of these stories.
293.789	This person you see here 
293.789	is Giovanni Andres.
296.443	Giovanni Andres is 25
296.443	when we took that picture.
299.274	He had been seven years in the guerrilla,
299.274	and he had demobilized very recently.
303.963	His story is the following:
306.528	He was recruited when he was 17,
309.724	and sometime later,
309.724	in his squadron, if you will,
314.909	this beautiful girl was recruited,
314.909	and they fell in love.
320.085	Their conversations were about
320.085	what their family was going to be like,
323.957	what their kids' names would be,
326.288	how their life would be
326.288	when they left the guerrilla.
328.885	But it turns out
330.342	that love is very strictly forbidden
330.342	in the lower ranks of the guerrilla,
333.935	so their romance was discovered
333.935	and they were separated.
337.298	He was sent very far away,
337.298	and she was left behind.
340.711	She was very familiar with the territory,
343.368	so one night, when she was on guard,
345.949	she just left,
347.65	and she went to the army, she demobilized,
351.112	and she was one of the persons
351.112	that we had the fortune to talk to,
354.996	and we were really touched by this story,
357.346	so we made a radio spot,
359.714	and it turns out, by chance,
362.64	that far away, many, 
362.64	many kilometers north,
366.123	he heard her on the radio,
369.281	and when he heard her on the radio,
369.281	"he said, ""What am I doing here?"
373.851	She had the balls to get out.
373.851	"I need to do the same thing."""
379.293	And he did.
380.691	He walked for two days and two nights,
383.589	and he risked his life and he got out,
385.952	and the only thing
385.952	he wanted was to see her.
388.913	The only thing that was
388.913	in his mind was to see her.
392.439	The story was, they did meet.
395.356	I know you're wondering if they did meet.
397.887	They did meet.
399.136	She had been recruited when she was 15,
399.136	and she left when she was 17,
403.139	so there were a lot
403.139	of other complications,
405.199	but they did eventually meet.
406.931	I don't know if they're together now,
406.931	but I can find out. (Laughter)
412.206	But what I can tell you is that
412.206	our radio strategy was working.
420.177	The problem is that it was working
420.177	in the lower ranks of the guerrilla.
423.861	It was not working with the commanders,
426.224	the people that are
426.224	more difficult to replace,
428.435	because you can easily recruit
428.435	but you can't get the older commanders.
434.013	So we thought, well,
434.013	we'll use the same strategy.
437.696	We'll have commanders
437.696	talking to commanders.
440.262	And we even went as far
440.262	as asking ex-commanders of the guerrilla
444.038	to fly on helicopters with microphones
446.773	telling the people that
446.773	used to fight with them,
450.234	"""There is a better life out there,"""
452.347	"""I'm doing good,"""
452.347	"""This is not worth it,"" etc."
454.924	But, as you can all imagine,
454.924	it was very easy to counteract,
460.03	because what was
460.03	the guerrilla going to say?
462.583	"""Yeah, right, if he doesn't do that,"
462.583	"he's going to get killed."""
465.791	So it was easy, so we were
465.791	suddenly left with nothing,
469.856	because the guerrilla
469.856	were spreading the word
472.135	that all of those things are done
474.846	because if they don't do it, 
474.846	they're in danger.
480.348	And somebody, some
480.348	brilliant person in our team,
483.512	came back and said,
483.512	"""You know what I noticed?"
487.15	I noticed that around Christmastime,
490.707	there have been peaks of demobilization
493.398	"since this war has started."""
496.393	And that was incredible,
499	because that led us to think 
499	that we needed to talk to the human being
504.481	and not to the soldier.
506.052	We needed to step away from talking
508.189	from government to army,
508.189	from army to army,
513.459	and we needed to talk
513.459	about the universal values,
516.756	and we needed to talk about humanity.
519.218	And that was when
519.218	the Christmas tree happened.
522.592	This picture that I have here,
524.599	you see this is the planning
524.599	of the Christmas trees,
527.791	and that man you see there
527.791	with the three stars,
531.54	he's Captain Juan Manuel Valdez.
533.669	Captain Valdez was the first 
533.669	high-ranking official
538.64	to give us the helicopters 
538.64	and the support we needed
542.503	to put these Christmas trees up,
544.853	and he said in that meeting
544.853	something that I will never forget.
548.145	"He said, ""I want to do this"
548.145	because being generous makes me stronger,
555.339	"makes my men feel stronger."""
557.691	And I get very emotional
557.691	when I remember him
560.431	because he was killed later in combat
560.431	and we really miss him,
564.816	but I wanted you all to see him,
564.816	because he was really, really important.
571.092	He gave us all the support
571.092	to put up the first Christmas trees.
575.22	What happened later is that
575.22	the guerrillas who came out
577.953	during the Christmas tree 
577.953	operation and all of that
581.573	"said, ""That's really good,"
581.573	Christmas trees are really cool,
585.369	but you know what?
585.369	We really don't walk anymore.
587.899	"We use rivers."""
589.351	So rivers are the highways of the jungle,
592.738	and this is something we learned,
594.935	and most of the recruiting was being done
594.935	in and around the river villages.
600.237	So we went to these river villages,
602.52	and we asked the people,
604.421	and probably some of them were
604.421	direct acquaintances of the guerrillas.
607.775	"We asked them, ""Can you send"
607.775	"guerrillas a message?"""
611.769	We collected over 6,000 messages.
615.159	Some of them were notes saying, get out.
617.805	Some of them were toys.
617.805	Some of them were candy.
620.522	Even people took off their jewelry,
620.522	their little crosses and religious things,
624.725	and put them in these floating balls
624.725	that we sent down the rivers
630.14	so that they could be picked up at night.
632.735	And we sent thousands
632.735	of these down the rivers,
635.093	and then picked them up
635.093	later if they weren't.
637.263	But lots of them were picked up.
638.795	This generated, on average,
638.795	a demobilization every six hours,
643.686	so this was incredible and it was about:
643.686	Come home at Christmas.
648.92	Then came the peace process,
653.001	and when the peace process started,
655.442	the whole mindset
655.442	of the guerrilla changed.
657.762	And it changed because
660.087	"it makes you think, ""Well,"
660.087	if there's a peace process,
662.836	this is probably going to be over.
664.778	"At some point I'm going to get out."""
666.89	And their fears completely changed,
669.096	and their fears were not about,
669.096	"""Am I going to get killed?"""
672.324	"Their fears were, ""Am I"
672.324	going to be rejected?
675.923	When I get out of this,
675.923	"am I going to be rejected?"""
678.732	So the past Christmas, 
678.732	what we did was we asked --
681.803	we found 27 mothers of guerrillas,
685.55	and we asked them to give us 
685.55	pictures of their children,
689.784	when they only could recognize themselves,
689.784	so as not to put their lives in danger,
693.989	and we asked them to give
693.989	the most motherly message you can get,
698.265	"which is, ""Before you were a guerrilla,"
698.265	you were my child,
702.857	"so come home, I'm waiting for you."""
705.109	You can see the pictures here.
705.109	I'll show you a couple.
708.261	(Applause)
709.605	Thank you.
715.552	And these pictures were placed
715.552	in many different places,
720.73	and a lot of them came back,
724.892	and it was really, really beautiful.
727.84	And then we decided to work with society.
731.315	So we did mothers around Christmastime.
733.972	Now let's talk about
733.972	the rest of the people.
736.826	And you may be aware of this or not,
736.826	but there was a World Cup this year,
742.19	and Colombia played really well,
742.19	and it was a unifying moment for Colombia.
749.617	And what we did was tell the guerrillas,
753.453	"""Come, get out of the jungle."
753.453	"We're saving a place for you."""
757.51	So this was television, this was 
757.51	all different types of media saying,
762.575	"""We are saving a place for you."""
765.037	The soldier here in the commercial says,
768.056	"""I'm saving a place for you"
768.056	right here in this helicopter
770.921	so that you can get out of this jungle
770.921	"and go enjoy the World Cup."""
774.734	Ex-football players, radio announcers,
777.901	everybody was saving
777.901	a place for the guerrilla.
780.195	So since we started this work
780.195	a little over eight years ago,
788.397	I do not -- (Applause)
792.436	Thank you.
795.017	I don't want to say in any way
795.017	that it only has to do with what we do,
803.714	but what I do know is that our work
803.714	and the work that we do
810.288	may have helped a lot of them
810.288	start thinking about demobilization,
814.96	and it may have helped a lot of them
814.96	take the final decision.
818.968	If that is true, advertising is still
818.968	one of the most powerful tools of change
825.498	that we have available.
827.74	And I speak not only my behalf,
830.631	but on behalf of all
830.631	the colleagues I see here
832.975	who work in advertising,
834.639	and of all the team that has
834.639	worked with me to do this,
838.665	that if you want to change the world,
841.914	or if you want to achieve 
841.914	peace, please call us.
844.375	We'd love to help.
845.875	Thank you.
847.238	(Applause)
