12.928	Everything is interconnected.
16.012	As a Shinnecock Indian, I was raised to know this.
19.538	We are a small fishing tribe
21.561	situated on the southeastern tip of Long Island
24.745	near the town of Southampton in New York.
27.91	When I was a little girl,
30.38	my grandfather took me to sit outside in the sun on a hot summer day.
35.728	There were no clouds in the sky.
39.282	And after a while I began to perspire.
42.453	And he pointed up to the sky, and he said,
45.979	"""Look, do you see that?"
48.827	That's part of you up there.
50.946	That's your water that helps to make the cloud
53.861	that becomes the rain that feeds the plants
58.134	"that feeds the animals."""
61.92	In my continued exploration of subjects in nature
64.912	that have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life,
69.328	I started storm chasing in 2008
72.029	"after my daughter said, ""Mom, you should do that."""
75.897	And so three days later, driving very fast,
82.108	I found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super cell,
89.368	capable of producing grapefruit-size hail
93.819	and spectacular tornadoes,
95.812	although only two percent actually do.
102.118	These clouds can grow so big, up to 50 miles wide
107.262	and reach up to 65,000 feet into the atmosphere.
111.328	They can grow so big, blocking all daylight,
113.702	making it very dark and ominous standing under them.
118.826	Storm chasing is a very tactile experience.
121.728	There's a warm, moist wind blowing at your back
125.995	and the smell of the earth, the wheat, the grass, the charged particles.
132.697	And then there are the colors in the clouds
136.094	of hail forming, the greens and the turquoise blues.
141.284	I've learned to respect the lightning.
144.562	My hair used to be straight.
146.696	(Laughter)
148.12	I'm just kidding.
149.744	(Laughter)
151.886	What really excites me about these storms
155.062	is their movement, the way they swirl and spin and undulate,
159.279	with their lava lamp-like mammatus clouds.
163.297	They become lovely monsters.
166.029	When I'm photographing them,
168.562	I cannot help but remember my grandfather's lesson.
172.295	As I stand under them,
174.287	I see not just a cloud,
176.494	but understand that what I have the privilege to witness
179.377	is the same forces, the same process in a small-scale version
183.827	that helped to create our galaxy, our solar system, our sun
190.145	and even this very planet.
194.703	All my relations. Thank you.
197.16	(Applause)
