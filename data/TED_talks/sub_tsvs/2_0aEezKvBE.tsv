16.053	So let me ask for a show of hands.
18.229	How many people here are over the age of 48?
22.421	Well, there do seem to be a few.
25.302	Well, congratulations,
27.477	because if you look at this particular slide of U.S. life expectancy,
31.347	you are now in excess of the average life span
34.445	of somebody who was born in 1900.
37.232	But look what happened in the course of that century.
40.766	If you follow that curve,
42.428	you'll see that it starts way down there.
45.042	There's that dip there for the 1918 flu.
47.511	And here we are at 2010,
49.933	average life expectancy of a child born today, age 79,
52.989	and we are not done yet.
54.885	Now, that's the good news.
56.22	But there's still a lot of work to do.
58.061	So, for instance, if you ask,
59.695	how many diseases do we now know
62.421	the exact molecular basis?
64.48	Turns out it's about 4,000, which is pretty amazing,
68.038	because most of those molecular discoveries
70.274	have just happened in the last little while.
72.939	It's exciting to see that in terms of what we've learned,
76.235	but how many of those 4,000 diseases
78.342	now have treatments available?
80.69	Only about 250.
82.578	So we have this huge challenge, this huge gap.
85.336	You would think this wouldn't be too hard,
87.916	that we would simply have the ability
89.442	to take this fundamental information that we're learning
92.468	about how it is that basic biology teaches us
95.613	about the causes of disease
97.515	and build a bridge across this yawning gap
100.541	between what we've learned about basic science
102.921	and its application,
104.416	a bridge that would look maybe something like this,
107.673	where you'd have to put together a nice shiny way
111.285	to get from one side to the other.
114.253	Well, wouldn't it be nice if it was that easy?
116.853	Unfortunately, it's not.
118.998	In reality, trying to go from fundamental knowledge
121.589	to its application is more like this.
124.253	There are no shiny bridges.
126.168	You sort of place your bets.
127.82	Maybe you've got a swimmer and a rowboat
129.781	and a sailboat and a tugboat
131.305	and you set them off on their way,
133.033	and the rains come and the lightning flashes,
135.697	and oh my gosh, there are sharks in the water
137.211	and the swimmer gets into trouble,
139.232	and, uh oh, the swimmer drowned
140.816	and the sailboat capsized,
144.028	and that tugboat, well, it hit the rocks,
145.729	and maybe if you're lucky, somebody gets across.
148.369	Well, what does this really look like?
150.358	Well, what is it to make a therapeutic, anyway?
152.412	What's a drug? A drug is made up
155.413	of a small molecule of hydrogen, carbon,
157.738	oxygen, nitrogen, and a few other atoms
159.989	all cobbled together in a shape,
162.212	and it's those shapes that determine whether, in fact,
164.589	that particular drug is going to hit its target.
167.902	Is it going to land where it's supposed to?
170.125	So look at this picture here -- a lot of shapes dancing around for you.
173.281	Now what you need to do, if you're trying to develop
175.668	a new treatment for autism
177.125	or Alzheimer's disease or cancer
179.344	is to find the right shape in that mix
181.136	that will ultimately provide benefit and will be safe.
184.053	And when you look at what happens to that pipeline,
187.22	you start out maybe with thousands,
188.721	tens of thousands of compounds.
190.363	You weed down through various steps
192.512	that cause many of these to fail.
193.895	Ultimately, maybe you can run a clinical trial with four or five of these,
197.235	and if all goes well, 14 years after you started,
200.277	you will get one approval.
202.288	And it will cost you upwards of a billion dollars
204.318	for that one success.
206.462	So we have to look at this pipeline the way an engineer would,
209.766	"and say, ""How can we do better?"""
210.974	And that's the main theme of what I want to say to you this morning.
213.651	How can we make this go faster?
215.464	How can we make it more successful?
218.529	Well, let me tell you about a few examples
219.87	where this has actually worked.
222.126	One that has just happened in the last few months
225.077	is the successful approval of a drug for cystic fibrosis.
228.787	But it's taken a long time to get there.
230.441	Cystic fibrosis had its molecular cause discovered in 1989
235.043	by my group working with another group in Toronto,
237.371	discovering what the mutation was in a particular gene
239.506	on chromosome 7.
241.134	That picture you see there?
243.172	Here it is. That's the same kid.
245.275	That's Danny Bessette, 23 years later,
248.619	because this is the year,
249.898	and it's also the year where Danny got married,
252.336	where we have, for the first time, the approval by the FDA
255.393	of a drug that precisely targets the defect in cystic fibrosis
259.13	based upon all this molecular understanding.
261.068	That's the good news.
262.492	The bad news is, this drug doesn't actually treat all cases of cystic fibrosis,
266.121	and it won't work for Danny, and we're still waiting
268.33	for that next generation to help him.
270.665	But it took 23 years to get this far. That's too long.
273.86	How do we go faster?
275.553	Well, one way to go faster is to take advantage of technology,
278.251	and a very important technology that we depend on
280.915	for all of this is the human genome,
283.211	the ability to be able to look at a chromosome,
285.799	to unzip it, to pull out all the DNA,
288.469	and to be able to then read out the letters in that DNA code,
291.419	the A's, C's, G's and T's
293.5	that are our instruction book and the instruction book for all living things,
296.771	and the cost of doing this,
298.285	which used to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars,
300.94	has in the course of the last 10 years
302.853	fallen faster than Moore's Law, down to the point
305.252	where it is less than 10,000 dollars today to have your genome sequenced, or mine,
309.259	and we're headed for the $1,000 genome fairly soon.
313.058	Well, that's exciting.
314.384	How does that play out in terms of application to a disease?
318.194	I want to tell you about another disorder.
320.474	This one is a disorder which is quite rare.
322.786	It's called Hutchinson-Gilford progeria,
325.554	and it is the most dramatic form of premature aging.
328.859	Only about one in every four million kids has this disease,
332.642	and in a simple way, what happens is,
336.002	because of a mutation in a particular gene,
338.703	a protein is made that's toxic to the cell
341.37	and it causes these individuals to age
343.667	at about seven times the normal rate.
346.251	Let me show you a video of what that does to the cell.
349.394	The normal cell, if you looked at it under the microscope,
352.529	would have a nucleus sitting in the middle of the cell,
355.418	which is nice and round and smooth in its boundaries
359.297	and it looks kind of like that.
361.052	A progeria cell, on the other hand,
362.916	because of this toxic protein called progerin,
366.018	has these lumps and bumps in it.
368.302	So what we would like to do after discovering this
371.317	back in 2003
373.169	is to come up with a way to try to correct that.
376.387	Well again, by knowing something about the molecular pathways,
379.475	it was possible to pick
381.474	one of those many, many compounds that might have been useful
384.091	and try it out.
385.552	In an experiment done in cell culture
388.127	and shown here in a cartoon,
390.169	if you take that particular compound
392.863	and you add it to that cell that has progeria,
396.119	and you watch to see what happened,
398.34	in just 72 hours, that cell becomes,
401.302	for all purposes that we can determine,
403.57	almost like a normal cell.
405.412	Well that was exciting, but would it actually work in a real human being?
409.753	This has led, in the space of only four years
413.138	from the time the gene was discovered to the start of a clinical trial,
416.639	to a test of that very compound.
418.836	And the kids that you see here
420.799	all volunteered to be part of this,
424.822	and you can see as soon as the picture comes up
427.917	that they are in fact a remarkable group of young people
431.299	all afflicted by this disease,
432.718	all looking quite similar to each other.
434.967	And instead of telling you more about it,
436.641	I'm going to invite one of them, Sam Berns from Boston,
440.627	who's here this morning, to come up on the stage
443.06	and tell us about his experience
445.28	as a child affected with progeria.
447.19	Sam is 15 years old. His parents, Scott Berns and Leslie Gordon,
451.248	both physicians, are here with us this morning as well.
453.369	Sam, please have a seat.
455.907	(Applause)
463.227	So Sam, why don't you tell these folks
465.405	what it's like being affected with this condition called progeria?
468.78	Sam Burns: Well, progeria limits me in some ways.
472.588	I cannot play sports or do physical activities,
476.552	but I have been able to take interest in things
479.756	that progeria, luckily, does not limit.
482.735	But when there is something that I really do want to do
485.292	that progeria gets in the way of, like marching band
488.309	or umpiring, we always find a way to do it,
491.735	and that just shows that progeria isn't in control of my life.
495.252	(Applause)
496.962	Francis Collins: So what would you like to say to researchers
498.998	here in the auditorium and others listening to this?
502.095	What would you say to them both about research on progeria
504.692	and maybe about other conditions as well?
506.578	SB: Well, research on progeria has come so far
509.724	in less than 15 years,
511.966	and that just shows the drive that researchers can have
516.335	to get this far, and it really means a lot
519.753	to myself and other kids with progeria,
523.004	and it shows that if that drive exists,
525.828	anybody can cure any disease,
528.429	and hopefully progeria can be cured in the near future,
532.376	and so we can eliminate those 4,000 diseases
536.133	that Francis was talking about.
539.14	FC: Excellent. So Sam took the day off from school today
542.269	to be here, and he is — (Applause) --
547.404	He is, by the way, a straight-A+ student in the ninth grade
552.22	in his school in Boston.
553.553	Please join me in thanking and welcoming Sam.
555.754	SB: Thank you very much. FC: Well done. Well done, buddy.
559.407	(Applause)
572.216	So I just want to say a couple more things
573.932	about that particular story, and then try to generalize
577.064	how could we have stories of success
579.56	all over the place for these diseases, as Sam says,
583.073	these 4,000 that are waiting for answers.
585.592	You might have noticed that the drug
587.464	that is now in clinical trial for progeria
590.233	is not a drug that was designed for that.
591.997	It's such a rare disease, it would be hard for a company
594.859	to justify spending hundreds of millions of dollars to generate a drug.
598.589	This is a drug that was developed for cancer.
600.749	Turned out, it didn't work very well for cancer,
602.914	but it has exactly the right properties, the right shape,
605.237	to work for progeria, and that's what's happened.
608.129	Wouldn't it be great if we could do that more systematically?
611.357	Could we, in fact, encourage all the companies that are out there
615.153	that have drugs in their freezers
616.991	that are known to be safe in humans
619.193	but have never actually succeeded in terms
621.485	of being effective for the treatments they were tried for?
624.341	Now we're learning about all these new molecular pathways --
626.725	some of those could be repositioned or repurposed,
629.804	or whatever word you want to use, for new applications,
632.203	basically teaching old drugs new tricks.
635.172	That could be a phenomenal, valuable activity.
637.859	We have many discussions now between NIH and companies
640.905	about doing this that are looking very promising.
643.029	And you could expect quite a lot to come from this.
645.643	There are quite a number of success stories one can point to
648.682	about how this has led to major advances.
651.035	The first drug for HIV/AIDS
653.242	was not developed for HIV/AIDS.
654.971	It was developed for cancer. It was AZT.
657.489	It didn't work very well for cancer, but became
659.49	the first successful antiretroviral,
661.606	and you can see from the table there are others as well.
664.178	So how do we actually make that a more generalizable effort?
667.822	Well, we have to come up with a partnership
670.046	between academia, government, the private sector,
672.906	and patient organizations to make that so.
675.359	At NIH, we have started this new
677.009	National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences.
680.209	It just started last December, and this is one of its goals.
683.824	Let me tell you another thing we could do.
685.265	Wouldn't it be nice to be able to a test a drug
688.184	to see if it's effective and safe
690.555	without having to put patients at risk,
692.656	because that first time you're never quite sure?
695.209	How do we know, for instance, whether drugs are safe
697.36	before we give them to people? We test them on animals.
700.605	And it's not all that reliable, and it's costly,
703.247	and it's time-consuming.
704.937	Suppose we could do this instead on human cells.
707.8	You probably know, if you've been paying attention
710.032	to some of the science literature
711.332	that you can now take a skin cell
712.988	and encourage it to become a liver cell
715.869	or a heart cell or a kidney cell or a brain cell for any of us.
718.944	So what if you used those cells as your test
722.096	for whether a drug is going to work and whether it's going to be safe?
725.041	Here you see a picture of a lung on a chip.
729.272	This is something created by the Wyss Institute in Boston,
732.793	and what they have done here, if we can run the little video,
735.968	is to take cells from an individual,
738.104	turn them into the kinds of cells that are present in the lung,
741.213	and determine what would happen
743.018	if you added to this various drug compounds
746.095	to see if they are toxic or safe.
748.56	You can see this chip even breathes.
750.831	It has an air channel. It has a blood channel.
753.448	And it has cells in between
755.151	that allow you to see what happens when you add a compound.
757.589	Are those cells happy or not?
759.361	You can do this same kind of chip technology
762.392	for kidneys, for hearts, for muscles,
764.601	all the places where you want to see whether a drug
767.065	is going to be a problem, for the liver.
769.346	And ultimately, because you can do this for the individual,
772.394	we could even see this moving to the point
774.608	where the ability to develop and test medicines
778.049	will be you on a chip, what we're trying to say here is
781.235	the individualizing of the process of developing drugs
784.736	and testing their safety.
786.984	So let me sum up.
788.636	We are in a remarkable moment here.
790.896	For me, at NIH now for almost 20 years,
792.999	there has never been a time where there was more excitement
795.6	about the potential that lies in front of us.
798.185	We have made all these discoveries
799.977	pouring out of laboratories across the world.
802.342	What do we need to capitalize on this? First of all, we need resources.
805.704	This is research that's high-risk, sometimes high-cost.
809.259	The payoff is enormous, both in terms of health
811.23	and in terms of economic growth. We need to support that.
814.11	Second, we need new kinds of partnerships
816.411	between academia and government and the private sector
818.632	and patient organizations, just like the one I've been describing here,
821.979	in terms of the way in which we could go after repurposing new compounds.
825.559	And third, and maybe most important, we need talent.
828.795	We need the best and the brightest
830.936	from many different disciplines to come and join this effort --
833.793	all ages, all different groups --
836.239	because this is the time, folks.
838.326	This is the 21st-century biology that you've been waiting for,
841.951	and we have the chance to take that
844.413	and turn it into something which will, in fact,
846.903	knock out disease. That's my goal.
849.233	I hope that's your goal.
851.117	I think it'll be the goal of the poets and the muppets
853.797	and the surfers and the bankers
855.806	and all the other people who join this stage
858.084	and think about what we're trying to do here
859.834	and why it matters.
860.999	It matters for now. It matters as soon as possible.
863.769	If you don't believe me, just ask Sam.
866.887	Thank you all very much.
868.33	(Applause)
