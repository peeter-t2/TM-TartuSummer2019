15.26	So it turns out that mathematics is a very powerful language.
18.931	It has generated considerable insight in physics,
21.243	in biology and economics,
23.343	but not that much in the humanities and in history.
26.16	I think there's a belief that it's just impossible,
28.443	that you cannot quantify the doings of mankind,
31.089	that you cannot measure history.
33.608	But I don't think that's right.
35.135	I want to show you a couple of examples why.
37.177	So my collaborator Erez and I were considering the following fact:
40.135	that two kings separated by centuries
42.864	will speak a very different language.
44.631	That's a powerful historical force.
46.935	So the king of England, Alfred the Great,
48.708	will use a vocabulary and grammar
50.348	that is quite different from the king of hip hop, Jay-Z.
54.048	(Laughter)
55.714	Now it's just the way it is.
57.885	Language changes over time, and it's a powerful force.
60.177	So Erez and I wanted to know more about that.
62.464	So we paid attention to a particular grammatical rule, past-tense conjugation.
66.121	"So you just add ""ed"" to a verb at the end to signify the past."
69.385	"""Today I walk. Yesterday I walked."""
71.312	But some verbs are irregular.
72.656	"""Yesterday I thought."""
74.052	Now what's interesting about that
75.718	is irregular verbs between Alfred and Jay-Z have become more regular.
79.548	"Like the verb ""to wed"" that you see here has become regular."
82.283	So Erez and I followed the fate of over 100 irregular verbs
86.305	through 12 centuries of English language,
88.224	and we saw that there's actually a very simple mathematical pattern
91.135	that captures this complex historical change,
93.677	namely, if a verb is 100 times more frequent than another,
97.337	it regularizes 10 times slower.
100.002	That's a piece of history, but it comes in a mathematical wrapping.
103.937	Now in some cases math can even help explain,
107.591	or propose explanations for, historical forces.
110.47	So here Steve Pinker and I
112.302	were considering the magnitude of wars during the last two centuries.
116.154	There's actually a well-known regularity to them
118.649	where the number of wars that are 100 times deadlier
122.071	is 10 times smaller.
124.023	So there are 30 wars that are about as deadly as the Six Days War,
127.367	but there's only four wars that are 100 times deadlier --
130.187	like World War I.
132.164	So what kind of historical mechanism can produce that?
135.087	What's the origin of this?
137.087	So Steve and I, through mathematical analysis,
139.352	propose that there's actually a very simple phenomenon at the root of this,
143.593	which lies in our brains.
145.283	This is a very well-known feature
147.302	in which we perceive quantities in relative ways --
150.277	quantities like the intensity of light or the loudness of a sound.
153.993	For instance, committing 10,000 soldiers to the next battle sounds like a lot.
159.302	It's relatively enormous if you've already committed 1,000 soldiers previously.
162.746	But it doesn't sound so much,
164.573	it's not relatively enough, it won't make a difference
167.593	if you've already committed 100,000 soldiers previously.
170.545	So you see that because of the way we perceive quantities,
174.158	as the war drags on,
175.925	the number of soldiers committed to it and the casualties
179.01	will increase not linearly --
180.693	like 10,000, 11,000, 12,000 --
182.581	but exponentially -- 10,000, later 20,000, later 40,000.
186.856	And so that explains this pattern that we've seen before.
189.941	So here mathematics is able to link a well-known feature of the individual mind
195.439	with a long-term historical pattern
198.428	that unfolds over centuries and across continents.
201.285	So these types of examples, today there are just a few of them,
205.302	but I think in the next decade they will become commonplace.
207.991	The reason for that is that the historical record
210.383	is becoming digitized at a very fast pace.
212.843	So there's about 130 million books
215.453	that have been written since the dawn of time.
217.764	Companies like Google have digitized many of them --
220.218	above 20 million actually.
221.802	And when the stuff of history is available in digital form,
225.38	it makes it possible for a mathematical analysis
227.76	to very quickly and very conveniently
230.135	review trends in our history and our culture.
232.86	So I think in the next decade,
235.581	the sciences and the humanities will come closer together
238.331	to be able to answer deep questions about mankind.
241.66	And I think that mathematics will be a very powerful language to do that.
245.781	It will be able to reveal new trends in our history,
248.927	sometimes to explain them,
250.677	and maybe even in the future to predict what's going to happen.
253.983	Thank you very much.
255.474	(Applause)
