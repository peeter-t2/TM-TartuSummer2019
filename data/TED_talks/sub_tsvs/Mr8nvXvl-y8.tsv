12.761	I want to tell you three stories
15.273	about the power of relationships
17.749	to solve the deep and complex
17.749	social problems of this century.
22.062	You know, sometimes it seems
22.062	like all these problems
24.999	of poverty, inequality, ill health,
24.999	unemployment, violence, addiction --
29.812	they're right there in one person's life.
32.662	So I want to tell you about someone
32.662	like this that I know.
36.367	I'm going to call her Ella.
38.46	Ella lives in a British city
38.46	on a run down estate.
42.19	The shops are closed, the pub's gone,
44.408	the playground's pretty desolate
44.408	and never used,
46.731	and inside Ella's house,
46.731	the tension is palpable
49.581	and the noise levels are deafening.
51.605	The TV's on at full volume.
53.443	One of her sons is fighting
53.443	with one of her daughters.
55.999	Another son, Ryan, is keeping up this
55.999	constant stream of abuse from the kitchen,
59.794	and the dogs are locked
59.794	behind the bedroom door and straining.
62.999	Ella is stuck.
64.735	She has lived with crisis for 40 years.
67.319	She knows nothing else,
67.319	and she knows no way out.
71.077	She's had a whole series
71.077	of abusive partners,
73.75	and, tragically, one of her children has
73.75	been taken into care by social services.
78.091	The three children
78.091	that still live with her
80.387	suffer from a whole range of problems,
80.387	and none of them are in education.
83.886	And Ella says to me that she
83.886	is repeating the cycle
86.907	of her own mother's life before her.
89.695	But when I met Ella,
89.695	there were 73 different services
92.999	on offer for her and her family
92.999	in the city where she lives,
	run out of 24 departments in one city,
100.454	and Ella and her partners and her children
100.454	were known to most of them.
103.788	They think nothing of calling
103.788	social services
105.926	to try and mediate one of the many
105.926	arguments that broke out.
108.802	And the family home was visited
108.802	on a regular basis by social workers,
112.275	youth workers, a health officer,
112.275	a housing officer, a home tutor
116.999	and the local policemen.
118.999	And the governments say
118.999	that there are 100,000 families
121.761	in Britain today like Ella's,
123.884	struggling to break the cycle of economic,
123.884	social and environmental deprivation.
129.269	And they also say
129.269	that managing this problem
131.467	costs a quarter of a million pounds
131.467	per family per year
134.493	and yet nothing changes.
135.889	None of these well-meaning visitors
135.889	are making a difference.
138.999	This is a chart we made in the same city
138.999	with another family like Ella's.
143.306	This shows 30 years of intervention
143.306	in that family's life.
146.932	And just as with Ella, not one of these
146.932	interventions is part of an overall plan.
150.787	There's no end goal in sight.
152.258	None of the interventions
152.258	are dealing with the underlying issues.
155.333	These are just containment measures,
155.333	ways of managing a problem.
158.367	One of the policemen says to me,
160.11	"""Look, I just deliver the message"
160.11	"and then I leave."""
162.623	So, I've spent time living
162.623	with families like Ella's
165.332	in different parts of the world,
166.896	because I want to know: what can we learn
169.158	from places where our social institutions
169.158	just aren't working?
172.675	I want to know what it feels like
172.675	to live in Ella's family.
175.49	I want to know what's going on
175.49	and what we can do differently.
179.525	Well, the first thing I learned
179.525	is that cost is a really slippery concept.
183.638	Because when the government says
183.638	that a family like Ella's
186.38	costs a quarter of a million pounds
186.38	a year to manage,
189.001	what it really means
190.176	is that this system costs
190.176	a quarter of a million pounds a year.
193.17	Because not one penny of this money
193.17	actually touches Ella's family
196.309	in a way that makes a difference.
197.913	Instead, the system is just
197.913	like this costly gyroscope
200.48	that spins around the families,
200.48	keeping them stuck at its heart,
203.483	exactly where they are.
205.532	And I also spent time
205.532	with the frontline workers,
207.879	and I learned that it
207.879	is an impossible situation.
210.726	So Tom, who is the social worker
210.726	for Ella's 14-year-old son Ryan,
215.465	has to spend 86 percent of his time
215.465	servicing the system:
218.999	meetings with colleagues,
218.999	filling out forms,
221.094	more meetings with colleagues
221.094	to discuss the forms,
223.546	and maybe most shockingly,
224.816	the 14 percent of the time
224.816	he has to be with Ryan
227.409	is spent getting data
227.409	and information for the system.
229.929	So he says to Ryan,
231.104	"""How often have you been smoking?"
231.104	Have you been drinking?
233.815	"When did you go to school?"""
235.152	And this kind of interaction
235.152	rules out the possibility
237.726	of a normal conversation.
238.962	It rules out the possibility
238.962	of what's needed
241.104	to build a relationship
241.104	between Tom and Ryan.
244.999	When we made this chart,
246.412	the frontline workers,
246.412	the professionals --
248.451	they stared at it absolutely amazed.
250.246	It snaked around the walls
250.246	of their offices.
252.999	So many hours, so well meant,
252.999	but ultimately so futile.
258.999	And there was this moment
258.999	of absolute breakdown,
262.463	and then of clarity:
264.319	we had to work in a different way.
267.652	So in a really brave step,
267.652	the leaders of the city where Ella lives
270.981	agreed that we could start
270.981	by reversing Ryan's ratio.
273.65	So everyone who came into contact
273.65	with Ella or a family like Ella's
276.834	would spend 80 percent of their time
276.834	working with the families
279.77	and only 20 percent servicing the system.
282.359	And even more radically,
284.234	the families would lead
285.428	and they would decide who
285.428	was in a best position to help them.
288.779	So Ella and another mother were asked
288.779	to be part of an interview panel,
292.162	to choose from amongst
292.162	the existing professionals
294.509	who would work with them.
296.8	And many, many people wanted to join us,
298.79	because you don't go into this kind
298.79	of work to manage a system,
301.885	you go in because you can
301.885	and you want to make a difference.
304.762	So Ella and the mother asked
304.762	everybody who came through the door,
307.999	"""What will you do when my son"
307.999	"starts kicking me?"""
310.455	And so the first person who comes in says,
312.999	"""Well, I'll look around"
312.999	for the nearest exit
315.142	and I will back out very slowly,
317.999	and if the noise is still going on,
317.999	"I'll call my supervisor."""
321.024	And the mothers go,
321.024	"""You're the system. Get out of here!"""
323.761	And then the next person who comes
323.761	is a policeman, and he says,
326.999	"""Well, I'll tackle your son to the ground"
326.999	"and then I'm not sure what I'll do."""
330.999	"And the mothers say, ""Thank you."""
332.701	So, they chose professionals who confessed
334.947	they didn't necessarily have the answers,
336.941	who said -- well, they weren't
336.941	going to talk in jargon.
340.554	They showed their human qualities
340.554	and convinced the mothers
343.467	that they would stick with them
343.467	through thick and thin,
346.104	even though they wouldn't
346.104	be soft with them.
348.187	So these new teams and the families
349.903	were then given a sliver
349.903	of the former budget,
352.086	but they could spend the money
352.086	in any way they chose.
354.601	And so one of the families
354.601	went out for supper.
356.86	They went to McDonald's and they sat down
356.86	and they talked and they listened
360.489	for the first time in a long time.
362.573	Another family asked the team
364.187	if they would help them do up their home.
367.253	And one mother took the money
368.784	and she used it as a float
368.784	to start a social enterprise.
372.335	And in a really short space of time,
374.808	something new started to grow:
377.241	a relationship between the team
377.241	and the workers.
380.163	And then some remarkable
380.163	changes took place.
383.104	Maybe it's not surprising
384.648	that the journey for Ella has had
384.648	some big steps backwards
387.406	as well as forwards.
388.591	But today, she's completed
388.591	an IT training course,
391.38	she has her first paid job,
391.38	her children are back in school,
394.692	and the neighbors,
395.867	who previously just hoped this family
395.867	would be moved anywhere
398.8	except next door to them,
400.03	are fine.
401.205	They've made some new friendships.
403.329	And all the same people have been
403.329	involved in this transformation --
407.369	same families, same workers.
409.999	But the relationship between them
409.999	has been supported to change.
414.556	So I'm telling you about Ella
414.556	because I think that relationships
417.661	are the critical resource we have
419.622	in solving some of these
419.622	intractable problems.
422.024	But today, our relationships
422.024	are all but written off
424.77	by our politics, our social policies,
424.77	our welfare institutions.
428.662	And I've learned that this
428.662	really has to change.
432.002	So what do I mean by relationships?
434.411	I'm talking about the simple
434.411	human bonds between us,
437.439	a kind of authentic sense
437.439	of connection, of belonging,
439.999	the bonds that make us happy,
439.999	that support us to change,
442.707	to be brave like Ella
442.707	and try something new.
445.535	And, you know, it's no accident
447.479	that those who run and work
447.479	in the institutions
450.042	that are supposed to support
450.042	Ella and her family
452.324	don't talk about relationships,
453.862	because relationships are expressly
453.862	designed out of a welfare model
457.958	that was drawn up in Britain
457.958	and exported around the world.
461.44	The contemporaries of William Beveridge,
463.397	who was the architect
463.397	of the first welfare state
465.679	and the author of the Beveridge Report,
467.623	had little faith in what they called
467.623	the average sensual or emotional man.
471.146	Instead, they trusted this idea
471.146	of the impersonal system
474.614	and the bureaucrat who would be detached
474.614	and work in this system.
478.999	And the impact of Beveridge
481.138	on the way the modern state
481.138	sees social issues
483.405	just can't be underestimated.
485.488	The Beveridge Report
485.488	sold over 100,000 copies
488.688	in the first weeks of publication alone.
491.041	People queued in the rain
491.041	on a November night to get hold of a copy,
494.274	and it was read across the country,
494.274	across the colonies, across Europe,
497.664	across the United States of America,
499.429	and it had this huge impact
501.225	on the way that welfare states
501.225	were designed around the globe.
504.846	The cultures, the bureaucracies,
504.846	the institutions -- they are global,
509.931	and they've come to seem
509.931	like common sense.
511.975	They've become so ingrained in us,
514.083	that actually we don't even
514.083	see them anymore.
516.856	And I think it's really important to say
516.856	that in the 20th century,
519.999	they were remarkably successful,
519.999	these institutions.
522.66	They led to longer lifespans,
522.66	the eradication of mass disease,
526.115	mass housing, almost universal education.
529.999	But at the same time,
531.999	Beveridge sowed the seeds
531.999	of today's challenges.
535.999	So let me tell you a second story.
537.787	What do you think today is a bigger killer
537.787	than a lifetime of smoking?
545.226	It's loneliness.
547.741	According to government statistics,
547.741	one person over 60 -- one in three --
552.681	doesn't speak to or see
552.681	another person in a week.
556.666	One person in 10, that's 850,000 people,
559.999	doesn't speak to anyone else in a month.
562.924	And we're not the only people
562.924	with this problem;
565.222	this problem touches the whole
565.222	of the Western world.
567.677	And it's even more acute
567.677	in countries like China,
569.999	where a process of rapid urbanization,
569.999	mass migration, has left older people
573.706	alone in the villages.
575.274	And so the services that Beveridge
575.274	designed and exported --
579.119	they can't address this kind of problem.
581.43	Loneliness is like a collective
581.43	relational challenge,
584.064	and it can't be addressed
584.064	by a traditional bureaucratic response.
588.486	So some years ago,
588.486	wanting to understand this problem,
591.461	I started to work with a group
591.461	of about 60 older people
594.358	in South London, where I live.
596.203	I went shopping, I played bingo,
598.302	but mainly I was just
598.302	observing and listening.
600.489	I wanted to know
600.489	what we could do differently.
603.837	And if you ask them, people tell you
603.837	they want two things.
606.689	They want somebody to go up a ladder
606.689	and change a light bulb,
609.622	or to be there when they
609.622	come out of hospital.
611.944	They want on-demand, practical support.
614.322	And they want to have fun.
615.904	They want to go out, do interesting things
615.904	with like-minded people,
619.146	and make friends like we've all
619.146	made friends at every stage of our lives.
623.478	So we rented a phone line,
623.478	hired a couple of handymen,
626.231	"and started a service we called ""Circle."""
628.592	And Circle offers its local membership
628.592	a toll-free 0 800 number
632.437	that they can call on demand
632.437	for any support.
635.19	And people have called us
635.19	for so many reasons.
637.383	They've called because
637.383	their pets are unwell,
639.526	their DVD is broken, they've forgotten
639.526	how to use their mobile phone,
642.824	or maybe they are coming out of hospital
644.773	and they want someone to be there.
646.45	And Circle also offers
646.45	a rich social calendar --
649.624	knitting, darts, museum tours,
649.624	hot air ballooning -- you name it.
654.255	But here's the interesting thing,
654.255	the really deep change:
658.674	over time, the friendships
658.674	that have formed
661.909	have begun to replace the practical offer.
664.964	So let me tell you about Belinda.
666.621	Belinda's a Circle member, and she was
666.621	going into hospital for a hip operation,
670.881	so she called her local Circle to say
670.881	they wouldn't see her for a bit.
674.889	And Damon, who runs the local Circle,
674.889	"calls her back and says, ""How can I help?"""
678.713	"And Belinda says, ""Oh no, I'm fine --"
680.648	Jocelyn is doing the shopping,
680.648	Tony's doing the gardening,
683.465	Melissa and Joe are going
683.465	"to come in and cook and chat."""
686.186	So five Circle members
686.186	had organized themselves
689.217	to take care of Belinda.
692.123	And Belinda's 80, although she says
692.123	that she feels 25 inside,
695.493	but she also says
697.081	that she felt stuck and pretty down
697.081	when she joined Circle.
701.083	But the simple act of encouraging her
701.083	to come along to that first event
705.588	led to a process where
705.588	natural friendships formed,
708.812	friendships that today are replacing
708.812	the need for expensive services.
713.157	It's relationships
713.157	that are making the difference.
717.572	So I think that three factors
717.572	have converged
720.504	that enable us to put relationships
720.504	at the heart and center
723.52	of how we solve social problems today.
726.389	Firstly, the nature of the problems --
728.476	they've changed, and they require
728.476	different solutions.
731.155	Secondly, the cost, human as much
731.155	as financial, of doing business as usual.
735.669	And thirdly, technology.
738.009	I've talked about the first two factors.
740.553	It's technology that enables
740.553	these approaches to scale
743.525	and potentially now support
743.525	thousands of people.
746.911	So the technology we've used
746.911	is really simple,
749.094	it's made up of available things
749.094	like databases, mobile phones.
752.571	Circle has got this very simple
752.571	system that underpins it,
755.331	enables a small local team to support
755.331	a membership of up to a thousand.
759.215	And you can contrast this
759.215	with a neighborhood organization
762.012	of the 1970s,
763.193	when this kind of scale
763.193	just wasn't possible,
765.38	neither was the quality or the longevity
765.38	that the spine of technology can provide.
769.52	So it's relationships
769.52	underpinned by technology
772.773	that can turn the Beveridge
772.773	models on their heads.
775.71	The Beveridge models are all
775.71	about institutions with finite resources,
779.38	anonymously managing access.
781.845	In my work at the front line,
783.489	I've seen again and again how
783.489	up to 80 percent of resource
787.199	is spent keeping people out.
789.258	So professionals have to administer
790.972	these increasingly complex forms
790.972	of administration
793.39	that are basically about stopping people
793.39	accessing the service
796.756	or managing the queue.
798.93	And Circle, like the relational services
798.93	that we and others have designed,
803.29	inverts this logic.
804.679	What it says is, the more people,
804.679	the more relationships,
808.696	the stronger the solution.
811.734	So I want to tell you my third
811.734	and final story,
814.12	which is about unemployment.
817.3	In Britain, as in most places
817.3	in the world,
820.09	our welfare states were primarily designed
822.654	to get people into work,
825.323	to educate them for this,
827.339	and to keep them healthy.
829.035	But here, too, the systems are failing.
831.592	And so the response has been
832.988	to try and make these old systems
832.988	even more efficient and transactional --
836.549	to speed up processing times, divide
836.549	people into ever-smaller categories,
840.205	try and target services at them
840.205	more efficiently -- in other words,
843.4	the very opposite of relational.
847.425	But guess how most people find work today?
851.583	Through word of mouth.
853.399	It turns out that in Britain today,
853.399	most new jobs are not advertised.
858.024	So it's friends that tell you about a job,
860.191	it's friends that recommend you for a job,
862.488	and it's a rich and diverse social network
862.488	that helps you find work.
866.803	Maybe some of you here
866.803	this evening are thinking,
869.152	"""But I found my job through an advert,"""
871.037	but if you think back, it was probably
871.037	a friend that showed you the ad
874.383	and then encouraged you to apply.
875.984	But not surprisingly,
877.331	people who perhaps most need
877.331	this rich and diverse network
880.634	are those who are most isolated from it.
883.357	So knowing this,
884.656	and also knowing about the costs
884.656	and failure of current systems,
887.702	we designed something new
887.702	with relationships at its heart.
890.675	We designed a service
890.675	that encourages people to meet up,
896.061	people in and out of work,
897.525	to work together in structured ways
899.3	and try new opportunities.
902.308	And, well, it's very hard to compare
902.308	the results of these new systems
906.303	with the old transactional models,
907.999	but it looks like,
907.999	with our first 1,000 members,
910.324	we outperformed existing services
910.324	by a factor of three,
913.239	at a fraction of the cost.
915.223	And here, too, we've used technology,
918.127	but not to network people in the way
918.127	that a social platform would do.
921.549	We've used it to bring people face to face
921.549	and connect them with each other,
925.175	building real relationships
925.175	and supporting people to find work.
930.308	At the end of his life, in 1948,
933.279	Beveridge wrote a third report.
935.913	And in it he said he had made
935.913	a dreadful mistake.
940.356	He had left people
940.356	and their communities out.
945.111	And this omission, he said,
945.111	led to seeing people,
949.74	and people starting to see themselves,
951.899	within the categories
951.899	of the bureaucracies and the institutions.
955.708	And human relationships
955.708	were already withering.
959.296	But unfortunately, this third report
959.296	was much less read
962.536	than Beveridge's earlier work.
965.115	But today, we need to bring people
965.115	and their communities
969.35	back into the heart of the way
969.35	we design new systems and new services,
973.501	in an approach that I call
973.501	"""Relational Welfare."""
976.032	We need to leave behind
976.032	these old, transactional,
978.572	unsuitable, outdated models,
980.854	and we need to adopt instead
980.854	the shared collective relational responses
984.389	that can support a family like Ella's,
986.869	that can address an issue like loneliness,
989.2	that can support people into work
989.2	and up the skills curve
991.959	in a modern labor market,
993.427	that can also address challenges
993.427	of education, of health care systems,
997.589	and so many more of those problems
997.589	that are pressing on our societies.
1002.306	It is all about relationships.
1005.324	Relationships are the critical
1005.324	resource we have.
1008.375	Thank you.
1009.55	(Applause)
