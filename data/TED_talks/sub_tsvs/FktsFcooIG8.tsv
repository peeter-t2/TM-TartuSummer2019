15.838	I'm a brain scientist, and as a brain scientist,
18.935	I'm actually interested in how the brain learns,
22.007	and I'm especially interested in a possibility of
25.374	making our brains smarter, better and faster.
30.106	This is in this context I'm going to tell you
32.982	about video games. When we say video games,
35.732	most of you think about children.
38.27	It's true. Ninety percent of children do play video games.
42.248	But let's be frank.
45.166	When the kids are in bed, who is in front of the PlayStation?
49.955	Most of you. The average age of a gamer is 33 years old,
56.439	not eight years old, and in fact, if we look
59.446	at the projected demographics of video game play,
63.155	the video game players of tomorrow are
65.888	older adults. (Laughter)
69.012	So video [gaming] is pervasive throughout our society.
73.263	It is clearly here to stay. It has an amazing impact
77.646	on our everyday life. Consider these statistics
81.033	released by Activision. After one month of release
86.848	"of the game ""Call Of Duty: Black Ops,"" it had been played"
91.34	for 68,000 years
94.713	worldwide, right?
96.579	Would any of you complain if this was the case
99.526	about doing linear algebra?
102.689	So what we are asking in the lab is, how can we leverage that power?
106.984	Now I want to step back a bit.
108.832	I know most of you have had the experience of coming back
112.073	home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games.
116.793	(Shooting noises) The name of the game is to get
118.933	after your enemy zombie bad guys
121.897	before they get to you, right?
125.487	And I'm almost sure most of you have thought,
128.664	"""Oh, come on, can't you do something more intelligent"
131.985	"than shooting at zombies?"""
135.312	I'd like you to put this kind of knee-jerk reaction
138.778	in the context of what you would have thought
141.275	if you had found your girl playing sudoku
144.784	or your boy reading Shakespeare. Right?
149.135	Most parents would find that great.
151.872	Well, I'm not going to tell you that playing video games
155.216	days in and days out is actually good for your health.
158.184	It's not, and binging is never good.
161.384	But I'm going to argue that in reasonable doses,
165.375	actually the very game I showed you at the beginning,
168.344	those action-packed shooter games
170.928	have quite powerful effects and positive effects
174.704	on many different aspects of our behavior.
178.562	There's not one week that goes without some major
182.257	headlines in the media about whether video games are
185.033	good or bad for you, right? You're all bombarded with that.
189.649	I'd like to put this kind of Friday night bar discussion aside
195.337	and get you to actually step into the lab.
198.48	What we do in the lab is actually measure directly,
201.353	in a quantitative fashion, what is the impact
204.12	of video games on the brain.
206.889	And so I'm going to take a few examples from our work.
210.224	One first saying that I'm sure you all have heard
212.823	is the fact that too much screen time
215.109	makes your eyesight worse.
217.924	That's a statement about vision.
220.127	There may be vision scientists among you.
222.663	We actually know how to test that statement.
225.602	We can step into the lab and measure how good your vision is.
229.039	Well, guess what? People that don't play a lot
232.72	of action games, that don't actually spend a lot of time
235.71	in front of screens, have normal, or what we call
239.242	corrective-to-normal vision. That's okay.
241.896	The issue is what happens with these guys that actually
244.345	indulge into playing video games like five hours per week,
249.5	By that statement, their vision should be really bad, right?
252.728	Guess what? Their vision is really, really good.
255.425	It's better than those that don't play.
257.865	And it's better in two different ways.
260.137	The first way is that they're actually able to resolve
262.562	small detail in the context of clutter, and though that means
265.817	being able to read the fine print on a prescription
269.615	rather than using magnifier glasses, you can actually do it
274.242	with just your eyesight.
275.808	The other way that they are better is actually being able
278.624	to resolve different levels of gray.
281.533	Imagine you're driving in a fog. That makes a difference
284.704	between seeing the car in front of you
287.185	and avoiding the accident, or getting into an accident.
290.928	So we're actually leveraging that work to develop games
293.944	for patients with low vision, and to have an impact
298.418	on retraining their brain to see better.
301.753	Clearly, when it comes to action video games,
305.402	screen time doesn't make your eyesight worse.
308.297	Another saying that I'm sure you have all heard around:
312.283	Video games lead to attention problems and greater distractability.
316.657	Okay, we know how to measure attention in the lab.
320.562	I'm actually going to give you an example of how we do so.
324.163	I'm going to ask you to participate, so you're going to have
326.888	to actually play the game with me. I'm going to show you
329.912	colored words. I want you to shout out the color of the ink.
335.345	Right? So this is the first example.
338.728	"[""Chair""]"
339.818	"Orange, good. [""Table""] Green."
342.879	"[""Board""] Audience: Red.Daphne Bavelier: Red."
344.259	"[""Horse""] DB: Yellow. Audience: Yellow."
345.553	"[""Yellow""] DB: Red. Audience: Yellow."
346.878	"[""Blue""] DB: Yellow."
348.387	Okay, you get my point, right? (Laughter)
354.742	You're getting better, but it's hard. Why is it hard?
358.078	Because I introduced a conflict between
362.032	the word itself and its color.
364.945	How good your attention is determines actually how fast
367.984	you resolve that conflict, so the young guys here
370.511	at the top of their game probably, like, did a little better
373.072	than some of us that are older.
375.616	What we can show is that when you do this kind of task
378.184	with people that play a lot of action games,
379.784	they actually resolve the conflict faster.
383.104	So clearly playing those action games doesn't lead
386.312	to attention problems.
388.795	Actually, those action video game players have
390.766	many other advantages in terms of attention, and one
393.083	aspect of attention which is also improved for the better
395.982	is our ability to track objects around in the world.
400.76	This is something we use all the time. When you're driving,
403.304	you're tracking, keeping track of the cars around you.
406.552	You're also keeping track of the pedestrian, the running dog,
409.627	and that's how you can actually be safe driving, right?
412.68	In the lab, we get people to come to the lab,
415.744	sit in front of a computer screen, and we give them
417.824	little tasks that I'm going to get you to do again.
420.72	You're going to see yellow happy faces
423.672	and a few sad blue faces. These are children
427.488	in the schoolyard in Geneva during a recess
431.308	during the winter. Most kids are happy. It's actually recess.
435.609	But a few kids are sad and blue because they've forgotten their coat.
438.736	Everybody begins to move around, and your task
442.056	is to keep track of who had a coat at the beginning
445.18	and who didn't. So I'm just going to show you an example
447.671	where there is only one sad kid. It's easy because you can
450.5	actually track it with your eyes. You can track,
452.837	you can track, and then when it stops, and there is
455.117	a question mark, and I ask you, did this kid have a coat or not?
459.048	Was it yellow initially or blue?
461.876	I hear a few yellow. Good. So most of you have a brain. (Laughter)
465.673	I'm now going to ask you to do the task, but now with
470.469	a little more challenging task. There are going to be
472.557	three of them that are blue. Don't move your eyes.
475.74	Please don't move your eyes. Keep your eyes fixated
477.993	and expand, pull your attention. That's the only way
480.639	you can actually do it. If you move your eyes, you're doomed.
483.487	Yellow or blue?
484.95	Audience: Yellow.DB: Good.
486.596	So your typical normal young adult
489.099	can have a span of about three or four objects of attention.
492.735	That's what we just did. Your action video game player
495.495	has a span of about six to seven objects of attention,
498.695	which is what is shown in this video here.
501.673	That's for you guys, action video game players.
505.149	A bit more challenging, right? (Laughter)
507.034	Yellow or blue? Blue. We have some people
510.742	that are serious out there. Yeah. (Laughter)
513.946	Good. So in the same way that we actually see
517.55	the effects of video games on people's behavior,
521.028	we can use brain imaging and look at the impact
524.093	of video games on the brain, and we do find many changes,
527.878	but the main changes are actually to the brain networks
531.238	that control attention. So one part is the parietal cortex
535.782	which is very well known to control the orientation of attention.
539.501	The other one is the frontal lobe, which controls
541.934	how we sustain attention, and another one
544.644	is the anterior cingulate, which controls how we allocate
547.213	and regulate attention and resolve conflict.
550.51	Now, when we do brain imaging, we find that all three
553.374	of these networks are actually much more efficient
556.718	in people that play action games.
559.478	This actually leads me to a rather counterintuitive finding
564.229	in the literature about technology and the brain.
567.67	You all know about multitasking. You all have been faulty
572.119	of multitasking when you're driving
574.329	and you pick up your cellphone. Bad idea. Very bad idea.
579.02	Why? Because as your attention shifts to your cell phone,
582.923	you are actually losing the capacity to react swiftly
587.071	to the car braking in front of you, and so you're
589.519	much more likely to get engaged into a car accident.
595.09	Now, we can measure that kind of skills in the lab.
597.966	We obviously don't ask people to drive around and see
600.438	how many car accidents they have. That would be a little
602.783	costly proposition. But we design tasks on the computer
606.33	where we can measure, to millisecond accuracy,
609.448	how good they are at switching from one task to another.
613.976	When we do that, we actually find that people
616.544	that play a lot of action games are really, really good.
619.628	They switch really fast, very swiftly. They pay a very small cost.
624.111	Now I'd like you to remember that result, and put it
626.769	in the context of another group of technology users,
630.501	a group which is actually much revered by society,
632.911	which are people that engage in multimedia-tasking.
637.45	What is multimedia-tasking? It's the fact that most of us,
641.095	most of our children, are engaged with listening to music
644.376	at the same time as they're doing search on the web
647.123	at the same time as they're chatting on Facebook with their friends.
650.48	That's a multimedia-tasker.
652.816	There was a first study done by colleagues at Stanford
656.376	and that we replicated that showed that
658.929	those people that identify as being high multimedia-taskers
663.576	are absolutely abysmal at multitasking.
667.423	When we measure them in the lab, they're really bad.
670.16	Right? So these kinds of results really
672.866	makes two main points.
675.352	The first one is that not all media are created equal.
678.544	You can't compare the effect of multimedia-tasking
683.456	and the effect of playing action games. They have
685.102	totally different effects on different aspects of cognition,
688.494	perception and attention.
691.608	Even within video games, I'm telling you right now
694.448	about these action-packed video games.
696.201	Different video games have a different effect on your brains.
699.535	So we actually need to step into the lab and really measure
702.217	what is the effect of each video game.
704.728	The other lesson is that general wisdom carries no weight.
709.015	I showed that to you already, like we looked at the fact that
712.071	despite a lot of screen time, those action gamers
714.519	have a lot of very good vision, etc.
718.527	Here, what was really striking is that these undergraduates
721.845	that actually report engaging in a lot of high
725.086	multimedia-tasking are convinced they aced the test.
730.063	So you show them their data, you show them they are bad
732.353	"and they're like, ""Not possible."" You know, they have"
735.039	this sort of gut feeling that, really, they are doing really, really good.
738.895	That's another argument for why we need to step into the lab
741.84	and really measure the impact of technology on the brain.
745.432	Now in a sense, when we think about the effect
750.015	of video games on the brain, it's very similar
752.495	to the effect of wine on the health.
756.359	There are some very poor uses of wine. There are some
759.399	very poor uses of video games. But when consumed
763.615	in reasonable doses, and at the right age,
767.096	wine can be very good for health. There are actually
770.367	specific molecules that have been identified
773.631	in red wine as leading to greater life expectancy.
779.463	So it's the same way, like those action video games
782.735	have a number of ingredients that are actually really
784.397	powerful for brain plasticity, learning, attention,
788.367	vision, etc., and so we need and we're working on
791.972	understanding what are those active ingredients so that
794.727	we can really then leverage them to deliver better games,
798.617	either for education or for rehabilitation of patients.
802.86	Now because we are interested in having an impact
806.639	for education or rehabilitation of patients, we are actually
809.127	not that interested in how those of you that choose
812.543	to play video games for many hours on end perform.
816.415	I'm much more interested in taking any of you
820.24	and showing that by forcing you to play an action game,
824.02	I can actually change your vision for the better,
826.883	whether you want to play that action game or not, right?
829.214	That's the point of rehabilitation or education.
831.63	Most of the kids don't go to school saying,
833.556	"""Great, two hours of math!"""
836.296	So that's really the crux of the research, and to do that,
840.735	we need to go one more step.
843.199	And one more step is to do training studies.
846.223	So let me illustrate that step with
849.623	a task which is called mental rotation.
853.191	Mental rotation is a task where I'm going to ask you,
857.366	and again you're going to do the task,
859.251	to look at this shape. Study it, it's a target shape,
862.936	and I'm going to present to you four different shapes.
866.19	One of these four different shapes is actually a rotated
869.03	version of this shape. I want you to tell me which one:
873.334	the first one, second one, third one or fourth one?
878.175	Okay, I'll help you. Fourth one.
880.592	One more. Get those brains working. Come on.
885.122	That's our target shape.
890.096	Third. Good! This is hard, right?
893.799	Like, the reason that I asked you to do that is because
895.286	you really feel your brain cringing, right?
898.02	It doesn't really feel like playing mindless action video games.
901.452	Well, what we do in these training studies is, people
904.157	come to the lab, they do tasks like this one,
906.766	we then force them to play 10 hours of action games.
911.096	They don't play 10 hours of action games in a row.
913.842	They do distributed practice, so little shots of 40 minutes
916.952	several days over a period of two weeks.
921.253	Then, once they are done with the training, they come back
923.049	a few days later and they are tested again on a similar type
927.022	of mental rotation task. So this is work from a colleague
930.638	in Toronto. What they showed is that, initially,
933.173	you know, subjects perform where they are expected
935.371	to perform given their age. After two weeks of training
940.581	on action video games, they actually perform better,
944.437	and the improvement is still there five months after
949.793	having done the training. That's really, really important.
952.661	Why? Because I told you we want to use these games
955.141	for education or for rehabilitation. We need to have effects
958.341	that are going to be long-lasting.
961.277	Now, at this point, a number of you are probably wondering
964.13	well, what are you waiting for, to put on the market
967.763	a game that would be good for the attention
970.315	of my grandmother and that she would actually enjoy,
973.835	or a game that would be great to rehabilitate the vision
976.418	of my grandson who has amblyopia, for example?
980.227	Well, we're working on it, but here is a challenge.
984.707	There are brain scientists like me that are beginning
986.618	to understand what are the good ingredients in games
989.875	to promote positive effects, and that's what I'm going
992.98	to call the broccoli side of the equation.
996.554	There is an entertainment software industry
1000.29	which is extremely deft at coming up with
1003.762	appealing products that you can't resist.
1007.906	That's the chocolate side of the equation.
1011.434	The issue is we need to put the two together,
1014.458	and it's a little bit like with food.
1016.714	Who really wants to eat chocolate-covered broccoli?
1020.355	None of you. (Laughter) And you probably have had
1022.614	that feeling, right, picking up an education game
1024.946	and sort of feeling, hmm, you know, it's not really fun,
1028.338	it's not really engaging. So what we need
1030.755	is really a new brand of chocolate, a brand of chocolate
1034.106	that is irresistible, that you really want to play,
1038.117	but that has all the ingredients, the good ingredients
1041.102	that are extracted from the broccoli that you can't recognize
1044.33	but are still working on your brains. And we're working on it,
1047.169	but it takes brain scientists to come and to get together,
1051.645	people that work in the entertainment software industry,
1054.608	and publishers, so these are not people that usually
1057.346	meet every day, but it's actually doable,
1059.683	and we are on the right track.
1062.33	I'd like to leave you with that thought,
1064.112	and thank you for your attention. (Applause)
1067.479	(Applause)
