15.76	I'm a bug lover, myself --
17.783	not from childhood, by the way,
19.56	but rather late.
22.157	When I bachelored,
23.56	majoring in zoology
23.56	at Tel Aviv University,
26.277	I kind of fell in love with bugs.
28.438	And then, within zoology,
30.2	I took the course
30.2	or the discipline of entomology,
33.364	the science of insects.
36.004	And then I thought to myself,
36.004	how can I be practical
39.226	or help in the science of entomology?
42.56	And then I moved to the world
42.56	of plant protection --
45.817	plant protection from insects,
48.343	from bad bugs.
50.181	And then within plant protection,
52.56	I came into the discipline
52.56	of biological pest control,
56.845	which we actually define
58.559	as the use of living organisms
61.56	to reduce populations
61.56	of noxious plant pests.
66.084	So it's a whole discipline
66.084	in plant protection
69.21	aimed at the reduction of chemicals.
73.456	And biological pest control, by the way,
75.526	"or these ""good bugs"""
75.526	that we are talking about,
78.318	they've existed in the world
78.318	for thousands and thousands of years,
82.174	for a long, long time.
83.801	But only in the last 120 years,
87.488	people started, or people
87.488	knew more and more
90.902	how to exploit, or how to use,
90.902	this biological control phenomenon,
95.312	or in fact, natural control phenomenon,
98.716	for their own needs.
101.44	Because biological control phenomenon --
101.44	you can see it in your backyard.
105.072	Just take a magnifying glass.
105.072	You see what I have here?
108.052	That's a magnifier, times 10.
112.09	You just open it, twist leaves,
115.112	and you see a whole new world
115.112	of minute insects,
118.56	or little spiders of one millimeter,
118.56	one-and-a-half, two millimeters long,
123.56	and you can distinguish
123.56	between the good ones and the bad ones.
126.584	So this phenomenon of natural control
126.584	exists literally everywhere.
131.148	Here, in front of this building, I'm sure.
133.226	Just have a look at the plants.
135.165	So it's everywhere,
135.165	and we need to know how to exploit it.
139.329	Well, let's go hand by hand
141.33	and browse through just a few examples.
144.56	What is a pest?
146.099	What damage does it actually
146.099	inflict on the plant?
149.433	And what is the natural enemy,
151.718	the biological control agent,
151.718	"or the ""good bug"""
154.725	that we're talking about?
155.95	In general, I'm going to talk
155.95	about insects and spiders,
160.987	or mites, let us call them.
163.234	Insects, those six-legged organisms
166.027	and spiders or mites,
166.027	the eight-legged organisms.
170.129	Let's have a look at that.
171.56	Here is a devastating pest, a spider mite,
174.812	because it does a lot
174.812	of webbing, like a spider.
178.06	You see the mother in between,
179.606	and two daughters, probably,
179.606	on the left and right,
182.04	and a single egg on the right-hand side.
184.132	And then you see
184.132	what kind of damage it can inflict.
186.644	On your right-hand side,
186.644	you can see a cucumber leaf,
189.21	in the middle, a cotton leaf,
190.675	and on the left, a tomato leaf
190.675	with these little stipplings.
193.897	They can literally turn
193.897	from green to white,
196.974	because of the sucking, piercing
196.974	mouth parts of those spiders.
203.018	But here comes nature,
203.018	that provides us with a good spider.
206.712	This is a predatory mite --
206.712	just as small as a spider mite;
210.118	one, two millimeters long,
210.118	not more than that --
212.946	running quickly, hunting,
212.946	chasing the spider mites.
217.384	And here, you can see this lady
217.384	in action on your left-hand side --
221.276	just pierces, sucks the body fluids
221.276	on the left-hand side of the pest mite.
226.926	And after five minutes,
226.926	this is what you see:
229.56	just a typical dead corpse --
231.903	the shriveled, sucked-out,
231.903	dead corpse of the spider mite,
235.56	and next to it, two satiated
235.56	individuals, predatory mites,
240.448	a mother on the left-hand side,
240.448	a young nymph on the right-hand side.
243.969	By the way, a meal for them for 24 hours,
246.915	is about five of the spider mites,
246.915	of the bad mites,
251.189	and-or 15 to 20 eggs of the pest mites.
256.098	By the way, they are always hungry.
258.56	(Laughter)
260.823	And here is another example: aphids.
263.154	It's springtime now in Israel.
265.032	When temperatures rise sharply,
267.561	you can see those bad ones,
267.561	those aphids, all over the plants --
270.858	in your hibiscus, in your lantana,
273.56	in the young, fresh foliage
273.56	of the so-called spring flush.
277.56	By the way, with aphids you have
277.56	only females, like Amazons.
281.56	Females giving rise to females,
281.56	giving rise to other females.
285.009	No males at all.
286.262	Parthenogenesis, as it's so called.
288.722	And they're very happy
288.722	with that, apparently.
290.861	(Laughter)
291.91	Here we can see the damage.
293.56	Those aphids secrete a sticky,
293.56	sugary liquid called honeydew,
300.344	and this just clogs
300.344	the upper parts of the plant.
304.387	Here you see a typical cucumber leaf
304.387	that turned from green to black
308.124	because of a black fungus, sooty mold,
308.124	which is covering it.
312.867	And here comes the salvation,
312.867	through this parasitic wasp.
318.219	Here we are not talking about a predator.
320.345	Here we are talking a parasite --
322.833	not a two-legged parasite,
324.73	but an eight-legged parasite, of course.
327.763	This is a parasitic wasp,
329.561	again, two millimeters long, slender,
329.561	a very quick and sharp flier.
335.34	And here you can see
335.34	this parasite in action,
338.148	like in an acrobatic maneuver.
340.839	She stands vis-Ã -vis
342.56	in front of the victim
342.56	at the right-hand side,
344.911	bending its abdomen
344.911	and inserting a single egg
350.109	into the body fluids of the aphid.
352.898	By the way, the aphid tries to escape.
355.079	She kicks and bites
355.079	and secretes different liquids,
359.362	but nothing will happen, in fact --
361.436	only the egg of the parasitoid
361.436	will be inserted
364.87	into the body fluids of the aphid.
367.032	And after a few days,
367.032	depending upon temperature,
369.992	the egg will hatch
371.433	and the larva of this parasite
371.433	will eat the aphid from the inside.
376.428	(Laughter)
377.503	This is all natural. This is all natural.
379.771	This is not fiction, nothing at all.
381.794	Again -- in your backyard.
381.794	In your backyard.
384.769	(Laughter)
386.298	(Applause)
387.787	But this is the end result: mummies.
394.354	This is the visual result
394.354	of a dead aphid encompassing inside,
399.56	a developing parasitoid that,
399.56	after a few minutes, you see halfway out.
405.479	The birth is almost complete.
407.709	You can see, by the way,
407.709	in different movies, etc.,
410.907	it takes just a few minutes.
412.56	And if this is a female,
412.56	she'll immediately mate with a male
416.086	and off she goes,
416.086	because time is very short.
418.946	This female can live
418.946	only three to four days,
421.56	and she needs to give rise
421.56	to around 400 eggs.
425.446	That means she has 400 bad aphids
428.872	to put her eggs into their body fluids.
432.464	This is, of course, not the end of it.
434.464	There is a whole wealth
434.464	of other natural enemies
436.87	and this is just the last example.
438.56	Again, we'll start first with the pest:
441.077	the thrips.
442.56	By the way, all these weird names --
444.887	I didn't bother you with the Latin
444.887	names of these creatures,
448.41	just the popular names.
449.674	But this is a nice,
449.674	slender, very bad pest.
453.81	If you can see this: sweet peppers.
456.182	This is not just an exotic,
456.182	ornamental sweet pepper.
459.205	This is a sweet pepper
459.205	which is not consumable
461.776	because it is suffering
461.776	from a viral disease
464.56	transmitted by those thrip adults.
468.17	And here comes the natural enemy,
468.17	minute pirate bug --
471.711	"""minute,"" because it is rather small."
474.314	Here you can see the adult,
474.314	black, and two young ones.
477.757	And again, in action.
479.326	This adult pierces the thrips,
482.874	sucking it within just several minutes,
485.144	going to the other prey,
485.144	continuing all over the place.
488.398	And if we spread those minute
488.398	pirate bugs, the good ones,
492.717	for example, in a sweet pepper plot,
495.637	they go to the flowers.
497.23	And look -- this flower is flooded
497.23	with predatory bugs, with the good ones,
502.338	after wiping out the bad ones, the thrips.
505.56	So this is a very positive situation.
508.168	No harm to the developing fruit.
508.168	No harm to the fruit set.
511.492	Everything is just fine
511.492	under these circumstances.
515.305	But again, the question is,
516.79	here you saw them on a one-to-one basis --
516.79	the pest, the natural enemy.
521.357	What we do is actually this.
524.804	In Northeast Israel,
524.804	in Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu,
528.257	there is a facility that mass-produces
528.257	those natural enemies.
532.971	In other words, what we do there
532.971	is amplify the natural control,
539.473	or the biological control phenomenon.
541.474	And in 30,000 square meters
541.474	of state-of-the-art greenhouses,
546.375	there, we are mass-producing
546.375	those predatory mites,
549.703	those minute pirate bugs,
551.422	those parasitic wasps, etc.
554.342	Many different parts.
555.693	By the way, they have
555.693	a very nice landscape --
557.973	you see the Jordanian Mountains
557.973	on the one hand,
560.373	and the Jordan Valley on the other hand,
562.374	and a good, mild winter
562.374	and a nice, hot summer,
566.451	which is an excellent condition
566.451	to mass-produce those creatures.
570.47	And by the way, mass-production --
570.47	it is not genetic manipulation.
574.734	There are no GMOs -- genetically
574.734	modified organisms -- whatsoever.
578.805	We take them from nature,
580.56	and the only thing that we do
580.56	is give them the optimal conditions,
584.881	under the greenhouses
584.881	or in the climate rooms,
587.56	in order to proliferate,
587.56	multiply and reproduce.
591.627	And that's what we get.
593.342	You see under a microscope.
595.223	You see in the upper left corner?
595.223	You see a single predatory mite.
598.391	And this is the whole bunch
598.391	of predatory mites.
601.81	You see this ampul. You see this one.
604.154	I have one gram of those predatory mites.
607.651	One gram is 80,000 individuals.
	to control one acre,
617.373	4,000 square meters,
619.235	of a strawberry plot
621.112	against spider mites for the whole season
624.065	of almost one year.
626.242	And we can produce
626.242	from this, believe you me,
629.814	several dozens of kilograms
629.814	on an annual basis.
634.24	So this is what I call
634.24	amplification of the phenomenon.
638.472	And no, we do not disrupt the balance.
642.295	On the contrary,
643.56	because we bring it to every cultural plot
646.467	where the balance was already disrupted
649.244	by the chemicals.
650.56	Here we come with those natural enemies
652.461	in order to reverse
652.461	a little bit of the wheel
655.392	and to bring more natural balance
655.392	to the agricultural plot
659.398	by reducing those chemicals.
661.263	That's the whole idea.
662.842	And what is the impact?
664.304	In this table, you can
664.304	actually see what is an impact
667.56	of a successful biological
667.56	control by good bugs.
671.908	For example, in Israel, where we employ
671.908	more than 1,000 hectares --
681	of biological pests
681	controlling sweet pepper
683.649	under protection,
	were actually reduced.
688.876	And Israeli strawberries, even more --
693.183	especially those aimed
693.183	against pest mites in strawberries.
698.106	So the impact is very strong.
701.244	And there goes the question,
703.416	especially if you ask
703.416	growers, agriculturists:
706.417	Why biological control?
708.134	Why good bugs?
709.936	By the way, the number of answers you get
712.726	equals the number of people you ask.
716.314	But if we go, for example,
716.314	to this place, Southeast Israel,
720.896	the Arava area
720.896	above the Great Rift Valley,
724.396	where the pearl of Israeli
724.396	agriculture is located,
729.465	especially under greenhouse conditions,
729.465	or under screenhouse conditions --
733.082	if you drive all the way
733.082	to Eilat, you see this
735.895	just in the middle of the desert.
737.832	And if you zoom in,
739.365	you can definitely watch this:
741.456	grandparents with their grandchildren,
743.667	distributing the natural
743.667	enemies, the good bugs,
746.56	instead of wearing special clothes
748.957	and gas masks and applying chemicals.
751.745	So safety, with respect
751.745	to the application,
754.355	is the number one answer
754.355	that we get from growers,
757.798	"for ""Why biological control?"""
760.949	Number two, many growers
760.949	are, in fact, petrified
764.943	by the idea of resistance,
768.15	that the pests will become
768.15	resistant to the chemicals,
772.727	just like in our case, that bacteria
772.727	becomes resistant to antibiotics.
776.56	It's the same, and it can
776.56	happen very quickly.
780.168	Fortunately, in either biological control
780.168	or even natural control,
784.56	resistance is extremely rare.
788.2	It hardly happens.
789.773	Because this is evolution,
789.773	this is the natural ratio,
793.149	unlike resistance, which happens
793.149	in the case of chemicals.
797.027	And thirdly, public demand.
800.496	The more the public demands
800.496	the reduction of chemicals,
805.324	the more growers become aware of the fact
809.193	that they should, wherever they can
809.193	and wherever possible,
811.959	replace the chemical control
811.959	with biological control.
815.994	Even here, there is another grower,
818.08	you see, very interested in the bugs,
818.08	the bad ones and the good ones,
821.831	wearing this magnifier
821.831	already on her head,
824.05	just walking safely in her crop.
827.127	Finally, I want to get to my vision,
830.411	or, in fact, to my dream.
832.871	Because, you see, this is the reality.
834.918	Have a look at the gap.
836.418	If we take the overall turnover
838.56	of the biocontrol industry worldwide,
841.029	it's 250 million dollars.
844.022	And look at the overall pesticide industry
847.14	in all the crops throughout the world.
849.337	I think it's times 100
849.337	or something like that.
852.232	Twenty-five billion.
853.962	So there is a huge gap to bridge.
857.56	So actually, how can we do it?
859.248	How can we bridge, or let's say,
859.248	narrow, this gap over the years?
864.152	First of all, we need to find more robust,
867.924	good and reliable biological solutions,
870.56	more good bugs that we can
870.56	either mass-produce
875.207	or actually conserve in the field.
878.273	Secondly, to create even more intensive
878.273	and strict public demand
882.883	for the reduction of chemicals
882.883	in agricultural fresh produce.
886.976	And thirdly, also to increase
886.976	awareness by the growers
890.758	to the potential of this industry.
893.56	And this gap really narrows.
896.083	Step by step, it does narrow.
899.817	So I think my last slide is:
902.046	All we are saying --
902.046	we can actually sing it --
904.335	Give nature a chance.
906.153	I'm saying it on behalf
906.153	of all the biocontrol practitioners
909.343	and implementers,
910.681	in Israel and abroad,
912.926	really give nature a chance.
914.982	Thank you.
916.165	(Applause)
