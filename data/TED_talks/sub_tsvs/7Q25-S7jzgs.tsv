26	I want to talk to you a little bit about user-generated content.
30	I'm going to tell you three stories on the way to one argument
34	that's going to tell you a little bit
36	about how we open user-generated content up for business.
40	So, here's the first story.
47	the United States Capitol, to talk about this technology,
51	"what he called the, quote, ""talking machines."""
55	Sousa was not a fan of the talking machines.
59	This is what he had to say.
60	"""These talking machines are going to ruin artistic development"
64	of music in this country.
65	When I was a boy, in front of every house in the summer evenings,
70	you would find young people together
72	singing the songs of the day, or the old songs.
76	Today, you hear these infernal machines going night and day.
82	"We will not have a vocal chord left,"" Sousa said."
85	"""The vocal chords will be eliminated by a process of evolution"
89	"as was the tail of man when he came from the ape."""
93	Now, this is the picture I want you to focus on.
98	This is a picture of culture.
100	We could describe it using modern computer terminology
104	as a kind of read-write culture.
107	It's a culture where people participate in the creation
110	and the re-creation of their culture. In that sense, it's read-write.
115	Sousa's fear was that we would lose that capacity
120	"because of these, quote, ""infernal machines."" They would take it away."
125	And in its place, we'd have the opposite of read-write culture,
129	what we could call read-only culture.
132	Culture where creativity was consumed
135	but the consumer is not a creator.
138	A culture which is top-down, owned,
141	where the vocal chords of the millions have been lost.
145	Now, as you look back at the twentieth century,
149	"at least in what we think of as the, quote, ""developed world"" --"
154	hard not to conclude that Sousa was right.
157	Never before in the history of human culture
160	had it been as professionalized, never before as concentrated.
164	Never before has creativity of the millions
167	been as effectively displaced,
169	"and displaced because of these, quote, ""infernal machines."""
173	The twentieth century was that century
175	where, at least for those places we know the best,
178	culture moved from this read-write to read-only existence.
186	So, second. Land is a kind of property --
189	it is property. It's protected by law.
193	As Lord Blackstone described it, land is protected by trespass law,
198	for most of the history of trespass law,
201	by presuming it protects the land all the way down below
206	and to an indefinite extent upward.
210	Now, that was a pretty good system
212	for most of the history of the regulation of land,
214	until this technology came along, and people began to wonder,
220	were these instruments trespassers
223	as they flew over land without clearing the rights
226	of the farms below as they traveled across the country?
230	Well, in 1945, Supreme Court got a chance to address that question.
235	Two farmers, Thomas Lee and Tinie Causby, who raised chickens,
241	had a significant complaint because of these technologies.
245	The complaint was that their
247	chickens followed the pattern of the airplanes
250	and flew themselves into the walls of the barn
254	when the airplanes flew over the land.
256	And so they appealed to Lord Blackstone
258	to say these airplanes were trespassing.
262	Since time immemorial, the law had said,
265	you can't fly over the land without permission of the landowner,
269	so this flight must stop.
273	Well, the Supreme Court considered this 100-years tradition
278	and said, in an opinion written by Justice Douglas,
282	that the Causbys must lose.
284	The Supreme Court said the doctrine protecting land
288	all the way to the sky has no place in the modern world,
292	otherwise every transcontinental flight would
296	subject the operator to countless trespass suits.
299	Common sense, a rare idea in the law, but here it was. Common sense --
304	(Laughter) --
305	Revolts at the idea. Common sense.
309	Finally. Before the Internet, the last great terror
317	to rain down on the content industry
320	was a terror created by this technology. Broadcasting:
326	a new way to spread content,
329	and therefore a new battle over the control
333	of the businesses that would spread content.
337	Now, at that time, the entity,
339	the legal cartel, that controlled the performance rights
343	for most of the music that would be broadcast
347	using these technologies was ASCAP.
349	They had an exclusive license on the most popular content,
353	and they exercised it in a way that tried to demonstrate
357	to the broadcasters who really was in charge.
360	So, between 1931 and 1939, they raised rates by some 448 percent,
367	until the broadcasters finally got together
370	and said, okay, enough of this.
372	And in 1939, a lawyer, Sydney Kaye, started something
375	called Broadcast Music Inc. We know it as BMI.
379	And BMI was much more democratic in the art
382	that it would include within its repertoire,
385	including African American music for the first time in the repertoire.
389	But most important was that BMI took public domain works
394	and made arrangements of them, which they gave away for free
398	to their subscribers. So that in 1940,
402	when ASCAP threatened to double their rates,
406	the majority of broadcasters switched to BMI.
409	Now, ASCAP said they didn't care.
411	The people will revolt, they predicted, because the very best music
415	was no longer available, because they had shifted
418	to the second best public domain provided by BMI.
424	Well, they didn't revolt, and in 1941, ASCAP cracked.
430	And the important point to recognize
433	is that even though these broadcasters
438	were broadcasting something you would call second best,
440	that competition was enough to break, at that time,
445	this legal cartel over access to music.
449	Okay. Three stories. Here's the argument.
453	In my view, the most significant thing to recognize
455	about what this Internet is doing
457	is its opportunity to revive the read-write culture
461	that Sousa romanticized.
465	Digital technology is the opportunity
467	for the revival of these vocal chords
469	that he spoke so passionately to Congress about.
473	User-generated content, spreading in businesses
477	in extraordinarily valuable ways like these,
480	celebrating amateur culture.
483	By which I don't mean amateurish culture,
486	I mean culture where people produce
489	for the love of what they're doing and not for the money.
493	I mean the culture that your kids are producing all the time.
498	For when you think of what Sousa romanticized
501	in the young people together, singing the songs of the day,
504	of the old songs, you should recognize
506	what your kids are doing right now.
509	Taking the songs of the day and the old songs
511	and remixing them to make them something different.
515	It's how they understand access to this culture.
518	So, let's have some very few examples
521	to get a sense of what I'm talking about here.
523	Here's something called Anime Music Video, first example,
525	taking anime captured from television
529	re-edited to music tracks.
531	(Music)
571	This one you should be -- confidence. Jesus survives. Don't worry.
576	(Music)
621	(Laughter)
629	And this is the best.
631	(Music)
638	My love ...
642	There's only you in my life ...
647	The only thing that's bright ...
653	My first love ...
658	You're every breath that I take ...
662	You're every step I make ...
668	And I ....
672	I want to share all my love with you ...
683	No one else will do ...
688	And your eyes ...
692	They tell me how much you care ...
698	(Music)
703	So, this is remix, right?
705	(Applause)
711	And it's important to emphasize that what this is not
713	"is not what we call, quote, ""piracy."""
716	I'm not talking about nor justifying
719	people taking other people's content in wholesale
722	and distributing it without the permission of the copyright owner.
725	I'm talking about people taking and recreating
728	using other people's content, using digital technologies
732	to say things differently.
734	Now, the importance of this
735	is not the technique that you've seen here.
739	Because, of course, every technique that you've seen here
741	is something that television and film producers
743	have been able to do for the last 50 years.
745	The importance is that that technique has been democratized.
750	It is now anybody with access to a $1,500 computer
755	who can take sounds and images from the culture around us
757	and use it to say things differently.
759	These tools of creativity have become tools of speech.
764	It is a literacy for this generation. This is how our kids speak.
771	It is how our kids think. It is what your kids are
776	as they increasingly understand digital technologies
780	and their relationship to themselves.
783	Now, in response to this new use of culture using digital technologies,
790	the law has not greeted this Sousa revival
794	with very much common sense.
796	Instead, the architecture of copyright law
799	and the architecture of digital technologies,
801	as they interact, have produced the presumption
804	that these activities are illegal.
807	Because if copyright law at its core regulates something called copies,
810	then in the digital world the one fact we can't escape
813	is that every single use of culture produces a copy.
818	Every single use therefore requires permission;
821	without permission, you are a trespasser.
824	You're a trespasser with about as much sense
826	as these people were trespassers.
831	Common sense here, though, has not yet revolted
835	in response to this response that the law has offered
838	to these forms of creativity.
841	Instead, what we've seen
842	is something much worse than a revolt.
846	There's a growing extremism that comes from both sides
850	in this debate, in response to this conflict
853	between the law and the use of these technologies.
856	One side builds new technologies, such as one recently announced
860	that will enable them
863	to automatically take down from sites like YouTube
866	any content that has any copyrighted content in it,
868	whether or not there's a judgment of fair use
871	that might be applied to the use of that content.
873	And on the other side, among our kids,
876	there's a growing copyright abolitionism,
880	a generation that rejects the very notion
883	of what copyright is supposed to do, rejects copyright
886	and believes that the law is nothing more than an ass
889	to be ignored and to be fought at every opportunity possible.
896	The extremism on one side begets extremism on the other,
900	a fact we should have learned many, many times over,
904	and both extremes in this debate are just wrong.
908	Now, the balance that I try to fight for,
912	I, as any good liberal, try to fight for first
914	by looking to the government. Total mistake, right?
918	(Laughter)
919	Looked first to the courts and the legislatures to try to get them
922	to do something to make the system make more sense.
924	It failed partly because the courts are too passive,
928	partly because the legislatures are corrupted,
930	by which I don't mean that there's bribery
933	operating to stop real change,
936	but more the economy of influence that governs how Congress functions
940	means that policymakers here will not understand this
944	until it's too late to fix it.
946	So, we need something different, we need a different kind of solution.
950	And the solution here, in my view, is a private solution,
954	a solution that looks to legalize what it is to be young again,
958	and to realize the economic potential of that,
960	and that's where the story of BMI becomes relevant.
964	Because, as BMI demonstrated, competition here
967	can achieve some form of balance. The same thing can happen now.
972	We don't have a public domain to draw upon now,
975	so instead what we need is two types of changes.
978	First, that artists and creators embrace the idea,
982	choose that their work be made available more freely.
986	So, for example, they can say their work is available freely
989	for non-commercial, this amateur-type of use,
991	but not freely for any commercial use.
993	And second, we need the businesses
996	that are building out this read-write culture
999	to embrace this opportunity expressly, to enable it,
1004	so that this ecology of free content, or freer content,
1009	can grow on a neutral platform
1011	where they both exist simultaneously,
1014	so that more-free can compete with less-free,
1019	and the opportunity to develop the creativity in that competition
1023	can teach one the lessons of the other.
1026	Now, I would talk about one particular such plan
1030	that I know something about,
1031	but I don't want to violate TED's first commandment of selling,
1034	so I'm not going to talk about this at all.
1036	I'm instead just going to remind you of the point that BMI teaches us.
1043	That artist choice is the key for new technology
1048	having an opportunity to be open for business,
1051	and we need to build artist choice here
1054	if these new technologies are to have that opportunity.
1057	But let me end with something I think much more important --
1060	much more important than business.
1062	It's the point about how this connects to our kids.
1065	We have to recognize they're different from us. This is us, right?
1070	(Laughter)
1071	We made mixed tapes; they remix music.
1073	We watched TV; they make TV.
1076	It is technology that has made them different,
1080	and as we see what this technology can do,
1082	we need to recognize you can't kill
1085	the instinct the technology produces. We can only criminalize it.
1089	We can't stop our kids from using it.
1091	We can only drive it underground.
1093	We can't make our kids passive again.
1096	"We can only make them, quote, ""pirates."" And is that good?"
1101	We live in this weird time. It's kind of age of prohibitions,
1105	where in many areas of our life,
1107	we live life constantly against the law.
1110	Ordinary people live life against the law,
1112	and that's what I -- we are doing to our kids.
1116	They live life knowing they live it against the law.
1120	That realization is extraordinarily corrosive,
1124	extraordinarily corrupting.
1127	And in a democracy, we ought to be able to do better.
1131	Do better, at least for them, if not for opening for business.
1138	Thank you very much.
1139	(Applause)
