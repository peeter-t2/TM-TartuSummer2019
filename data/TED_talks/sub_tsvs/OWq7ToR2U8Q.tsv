12.599	Now, I've been making pictures
12.599	for quite a long time,
15.246	and normally speaking,
15.246	a picture like this, for me,
17.638	should be straightforward.
19.565	I'm in southern Ethiopia.
19.565	I'm with the Daasanach.
22.421	There's a big family,
22.421	there's a very beautiful tree,
25.532	and I make these pictures
25.532	with this very large,
28.11	extremely cumbersome, very awkward
28.11	technical plate film camera.
31.871	Does anybody know
31.871	4x5 and 10x8 sheets of film,
35.331	and you're setting it up,
35.331	putting it on the tripod.
38.86	I've got the family, spent the better part
38.86	of a day talking with them.
42.715	They sort of understand what I'm on about.
44.731	They think I'm a bit crazy,
44.731	but that's another story.
47.239	And what's most important for me
47.239	is the beauty and the aesthetic,
50.609	and that's based on the light.
52.861	So the light's setting
52.861	on my left-hand side,
55.462	and there's a balance
55.462	in the communication with the Daasanach,
59.096	the family of 30, all ages.
60.64	There's babies and there's grandparents,
62.577	I'm getting them in the tree
62.577	and waiting for the light to set,
65.543	and it's going, going,
65.543	and I've got one sheet of film left,
68.632	and I think, I'm okay,
68.632	I'm in control, I'm in control.
71.173	I'm setting it up and I'm setting up,
71.173	and the light's just about to go,
74.745	and I want it to be golden,
74.745	I want it to be beautiful.
77.426	I want it to be hanging on the horizon
77.426	so it lights these people,
80.472	in all the potential glory
80.472	that they could be presented.
83.102	And it's about to go 
83.102	and it's about to go,
85.151	and I put my sheet in the camera,
86.776	it's all focused,
87.628	and all of a sudden
87.628	"there's a massive ""whack,"""
89.913	and I'm looking around,
89.913	and in the top corner of the tree,
92.687	one of the girls slaps
92.687	the girl next to her,
94.766	and the girl next to her pulls her hair,
94.766	and all hell breaks loose,
98.556	and I'm standing there going,
98.556	"""But the light, the light."
101.29	Wait, I need the light.
101.29	"Stay still! Stay still!"""
103.58	And they start screaming,
104.78	and then one of the men turns around
104.78	and starts screaming, shouting,
107.964	and the whole tree collapses,
107.964	not the tree, but the people in the tree.
111.397	They're all running around screaming,
111.397	and they run back off into the village
115.017	in this sort of cloud of smoke, and I'm
115.017	left there standing behind my tripod.
118.799	I've got my sheet, and the light's gone,
118.799	and I can't make the picture.
122.146	Where have they all gone? I had no idea.
124.17	It took me a week, it took me a week to
124.17	make the picture which you see here today,
128.032	and I'll tell you why. (Applause)
131.071	It's very, very, very simple --
131.071	I spent a week going around the village,
134.734	and I went to every single one:
134.734	"""Hello, can you meet at the tree?"
137.803	"What's your story? Who are you?"""
139.592	And it all turned out to be
139.592	about a boyfriend, for crying out loud.
142.837	I mean, I have teenage kids.
142.837	I should know.
144.92	It was about a boyfriend. The girl
144.92	on the top, she'd kissed the wrong boy,
148.593	and they'd started having a fight.
150.231	And there was a very, very beautiful
150.231	lesson for me in that:
153.028	If I was going to photograph these people
155.24	in the dignified, respectful way
155.24	that I had intended,
157.784	and put them on a pedestal,
157.784	I had to understand them.
160.297	It wasn't just about turning up.
160.297	It wasn't just about shaking a hand.
163.587	It wasn't about just saying,
163.587	"""I'm Jimmy, I'm a photographer."""
166.642	I had to get to know
166.642	every single one of them,
168.812	right down to whose boyfriend is who
168.812	and who is allowed to kiss who.
172.085	So in the end, a week later,
173.971	and I was absolutely exhausted,
175.472	I mean on my knees going,
175.472	"""Please get back up in that tree."
178.243	"It's a picture I need to make."""
179.766	They all came back.
179.766	I put them all back up in the tree.
182.455	I made sure the girls
182.455	were in the right position,
184.765	and the ones that slapped,
184.765	one was over there.
186.93	They did look at each other.
186.93	If you look at it later,
189.488	they're staring
189.488	at each other very angrily,
191.952	and I've got the tree and everything,
193.943	and then at the last minute, I go,
193.943	"""The goat, the goat!"
196.598	I need something for the eye to look at.
196.598	"I need a white goat in the middle."""
200.307	So I swapped all the goats around.
200.307	I put the goats in.
202.896	But even then I got it wrong, because
202.896	if you can see on the left-hand side,
206.507	another little boy storms off
206.507	because I didn't choose his goat.
209.594	So the moral being I have to learn
209.594	to speak Goat as well as Daasanach.
212.948	But anyway, the effort
212.948	that goes into that picture
215.461	and the story that I've
215.461	just related to you,
217.555	as you can imagine,
218.563	there are hundreds of other
218.563	bizarre, eccentric stories
221.099	of hundreds of other people
221.099	around the world.
223.241	And this was about four years ago,
223.241	and I set off on a journey,
226.723	to be honest, a very indulgent journey.
228.744	I'm a real romantic. I'm an idealist,
228.744	perhaps in some ways naive.
233.959	But I truly believe that there are people
233.959	on the planet that are beautiful.
237.752	It's very, very simple.
237.752	It's not rocket science.
240.5	I wanted to put
240.5	these people on a pedestal.
242.512	I wanted to put them on a pedestal
242.512	like they'd never been seen before.
245.995	So, I chose about 35 different groups,
250.022	tribes, indigenous cultures.
251.901	They were chosen purely
251.901	because of their aesthetic,
254.517	and I'll talk more about that later.
256.374	I'm not an anthropologist, I have
256.374	no technical study with the subject,
259.95	but I do have a very,
259.95	very, very deep passion,
262.852	and I believe that I had to choose
262.852	the most beautiful people on the planet
266.324	in the most beautiful
266.324	environment that they lived in,
268.91	and put the two together
268.91	and present them to you.
271.825	About a year ago,
273.289	I published the first pictures,
275.402	and something extraordinarily
275.402	exciting happened.
279.419	The whole world came running,
280.973	and it was a bizarre experience,
280.973	because everybody, from everywhere:
284.298	"""Who are they? What are they?"
284.298	How many are they?
286.629	Where did you find them?
286.629	Are they real? You faked it.
289.189	"Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. Tell me."""
289.189	Millions of questions for which,
292.619	to be honest, I don't have the answers.
294.743	I really didn't have the answers,
296.423	and I could sort of understand, okay,
296.423	they're beautiful, that was my intention,
300.246	but the questions that I
300.246	was being fired at,
302.313	I could not answer them.
304.356	Until, it was quite amusing,
304.356	about a year ago
307.189	"somebody said, ""You've been"
307.189	"invited to do a TED Talk."""
309.84	"And I said, ""Ted? Ted? Who's Ted?"
309.84	"I haven't met Ted before."""
313.464	"He said, ""No, a TED Talk."""
313.464	"I said, ""But who's Ted?"
316.021	Do I have to talk to him or do we
316.021	"sit with each other on the stage?"""
319.343	"And, ""No, no, the TED group."
319.343	"You must know about it."""
322.48	"And I said, ""I've been in a teepee"
322.48	and in a yurt for the last five years.
326.095	How do I know who Ted is?
326.095	"Introduce me to him."""
328.428	Anyway, to cut a long story short,
328.428	"he said, ""We have to do a TED Talk."""
331.767	Researched. Oh, exciting. That's great!
333.666	And then eventually you're going
333.666	to go to TEDGlobal.
336.14	Even more exciting.
337.274	But what you need to do, you need
337.274	to teach the people lessons,
340.298	lessons that you've learned
340.298	on your travels around the world
343.35	with these tribes.
344.28	I thought, lessons, okay, well,
344.28	what did I learn? Good question.
347.58	Three. You need three lessons,
347.58	and they need to be terribly profound.
350.886	(Laughter)
352.804	And I thought, three lessons, well,
352.804	I'm going to think about it.
355.947	(Applause)
361.193	So I thought long and hard,
361.193	and I stood here two days ago,
364.54	and I had my test run,
364.54	and I had my cards
366.505	and my clicker in my hands
366.505	and my pictures were on the screen,
369.449	and I had my three lessons,
369.449	and I started presenting them,
372.169	and I had this very odd
372.169	out-of-body experience.
374.563	I sort of looked at myself
374.563	"standing there, going, ""Oh, Jimmy,"
377.417	this is complete loads of codswallop.
379.233	All these people sitting here,
379.233	they've had more of these talks,
382.417	they've heard more lessons in their life.
384.421	Who are you to tell them
384.421	what you've learned?
386.573	Who are you to guide them
386.573	and who are you to show them
389.216	what is right, what is wrong,
389.216	"what these people have to say?"""
392.171	And I had a little bit of a,
392.171	it was very private,
394.452	a little bit of a meltdown.
395.77	I went back, and a little bit like the boy
395.77	walking away from the tree with his goats,
399.907	very disgruntled, going, that didn't work,
403.158	It wasn't what I wanted to communicate.
405.433	And I thought long and hard about it,
405.433	and I thought, well, the only thing
409.035	I can communicate is very, very basic.
410.888	You have to turn it all the way around.
412.775	There's only one person
412.775	I know here, and that's me.
416.153	I'm still getting to know myself,
417.895	and it's a lifelong journey, and I
417.895	probably won't have all the answers,
421.33	but I did learn some extraordinary
421.33	things on this journey.
425.44	So what I'm going to do
425.44	is share with you my lessons.
428.597	It's a very, as I explained at the
428.597	beginning, very indulgent, very personal,
432.323	how and why I made these pictures,
434.654	and I leave it to you as the audience
434.654	to interpret what these lessons
437.889	have meant to me, what they could
437.889	perhaps mean to you.
442.377	I traveled enormously as a child.
445.092	I was very nomadic.
445.092	It was actually very exciting.
447.613	All around the world,
449.424	and I had this feeling that I
449.424	was pushed off at great speed
453.3	to become somebody,
453.3	become that individual, Jimmy.
455.763	Go off into the planet,
455.763	and so I ran, and I ran,
458.161	and my wife sometimes kids me,
458.161	"""Jimmy, you look a bit like Forrest Gump,"""
461.671	"but I'm, ""No, it's all"
461.671	"about something, trust me."""
464.008	So I kept running and I kept running,
464.008	and I sort of got somewhere
467.171	and I sort of stood there and looked
467.171	around me and I thought, well,
470.342	where do I belong? Where do I fit?
472.201	What am I? Where am I from? I had no idea.
475.513	So I hope there aren't too many
475.513	psychologists in this audience.
478.59	Perhaps part of this journey
479.98	is about me trying to find out
479.98	where I belonged.
483.103	So whilst going, and don't worry, I didn't
483.103	when I arrived with these tribes,
487.2	I didn't paint myself yellow and run
487.2	around with these spears and loincloths.
490.974	But what I did find were people
490.974	that belonged themselves,
493.9	and they inspired me,
493.9	some extraordinary people,
496.57	and I'd like to introduce you
496.57	to some heroes of mine.
499.38	They're the Huli.
501.272	Now, the Huli are some of the most
501.272	extraordinarily beautiful people
505.382	on the planet.
506.659	They're proud. They live in
506.659	the Papua New Guinean highlands.
510.631	There's not many of them left,
510.631	and they're called the Huli wigmen.
513.73	And images like this, I mean,
513.73	this is what it's all about for me.
516.808	And you've spent weeks and months there
516.808	talking with them, getting there,
520.298	and I want to put them on a pedestal,
520.298	"and I said, ""You have something"
523.547	that many people have not seen.
525.08	"You sit in this stunning nature."""
526.735	And it really does look like this,
526.735	and they really do look like this.
530.016	This is the real thing.
531.217	And you know why they're proud?
531.217	You know why they look like this,
534.271	and why I broke my back literally
536.064	to photograph them
536.064	and present them to you?
538.238	It's because they have
538.238	these extraordinary rituals.
540.74	And the Huli have this ritual:
540.74	When they're teenagers,
543.263	becoming a man,
543.263	they have to shave their heads,
546.14	and they spend the rest of their life
546.14	shaving their heads every single day,
550.262	and what they do with that hair,
552.226	they make it into a creation,
554.13	a creation that's
554.13	a very personal creation.
556.126	It's their creation.
556.126	It's their Huli creation.
558.379	So they're called the Huli wigmen.
560.422	That's a wig on his head.
562.279	It's all made out of his human hair.
564.035	And then they decorate that wig with
564.035	the feathers of the birds of paradise,
567.573	and don't worry,
567.573	there are many birds there.
569.821	There's very few people living,
569.821	so nothing to get too upset about,
573.033	and they spend the rest of their life
573.033	recreating these hats
575.94	and getting further
575.94	and further,
577.494	and it's extraordinary,
577.494	and there's another group,
579.898	they're called the Kalam,
579.898	and they live in the next valley,
582.93	but they speak a completely
582.93	different language,
585.148	they look completely different,
585.148	and they wear a hat,
587.62	and it's built out of scarabs,
589.217	these fantastic emerald green
589.217	little scarabs,
591.53	and sometimes there are 5,000
591.53	or 6,000 scarabs in this hat,
594.637	and they spend the whole of their life
594.637	collecting these scarabs
597.68	to build these hats.
598.698	So the Huli inspired me
598.698	in that they belong.
602.622	Perhaps I have to work harder
602.622	at finding a ritual which matters for me
606.198	and going back into my past
606.198	to see where I actually fit.
610.679	An extremely important part
610.679	of this project
613.349	was about how I photograph
613.349	these extraordinary people.
619.27	And it's basically beauty.
619.27	I think beauty matters.
622.66	We spend the whole of our existence
622.66	revolving around beauty:
626.12	beautiful places, beautiful things,
626.12	and ultimately, beautiful people.
629.788	It's very, very, very significant.
631.808	I've spent all of my life analyzing
631.808	what do I look like?
634.595	Am I perceived as beautiful?
636.332	Does it matter if I'm
636.332	a beautiful person or not,
638.705	or is it purely based on my aesthetic?
640.678	And then when I went off,
640.678	I came to a very narrow conclusion.
643.604	Do I have to go around the world
643.604	photographing, excuse me,
647.156	women between the age of 25 and 30?
647.156	Is that what beauty is going to be?
650.954	Is everything before and after that
650.954	utterly irrelevant?
654.409	And it was only until I went on a journey,
656.653	a journey that was so extreme,
659.44	I still get shivers when I think about it.
662.048	I went to a part of the world,
662.048	and I don't know whether any of you
665.197	have ever heard of Chukotka.
665.197	Has anybody ever heard of Chukotka?
668.402	Chukotka probably is, technically,
668.402	as far as one can go
672.929	and still be on the living planet.
676.691	It's 13 hours' flight from Moscow.
678.757	First you've got to get to Moscow, and
678.757	then 13 hours' flight nonstop from Moscow.
682.605	And that's if you get there.
685.326	As you can see, some people
685.326	sort of miss the runway.
687.851	And then when you land there,
687.851	in Chukotka are the Chukchis.
690.86	Now, the Chukchis are the last
690.86	indigenous Inuits of Siberia,
694.151	and they're people I'd heard about,
694.151	I'd hardly seen any images of,
697.344	but I knew they were there,
698.74	and I'd been in touch with this guide,
700.734	and this guide said,
701.773	"""There's this fantastic tribe."
701.773	There's only about 40 of them.
704.81	"You'll be okay. We'll find them."""
704.81	So off we went on this journey.
708	When we arrived there, after a month
708	of traveling across the ice,
711.062	and we'd got to them, but then
711.062	I was not allowed to photograph them.
714.386	"They said, ""You cannot photograph us."
714.386	You have to wait.
716.955	You have to wait until you get to know us.
716.955	You have to wait until you understand us.
721.138	You have to wait until you see
721.138	"how we interact with one another."""
724.264	And only then, it was many,
724.264	many weeks later, I saw a respect.
727.202	They had zero judgment.
728.736	They observed one another, from the youth,
728.736	from the middle aged to the old.
732.334	They need each other.
734.6	The children need to chew the meat all day
736.63	because the adults don't have any teeth,
738.779	but at the same time, the children
738.779	take the old aged people out
741.737	to the toilet because they're infirm,
743.707	so there's this fantastic
743.707	community of respect.
745.992	And they adore and admire one another,
745.992	and they truly taught me
749.75	what beauty was.
751.513	(Applause)
754.113	Now I'm going to ask for a little bit
754.113	of audience interaction.
757.061	This is extremely important
757.061	for the end of my talk.
759.618	If you could look at somebody
759.618	left to the right of you,
762.249	and I want you to observe them,
764.233	and I want you to give them a compliment.
764.233	This is very important.
767.411	Now, it may be their nose or their hair
767.411	or even their aura, I don't mind,
771.434	but please look at each other,
771.434	give them a compliment.
774.477	You have to be quick,
774.477	because I'm running out of time.
777.17	And you have to remember it.
781.768	Okay, thank you, thank you, thank you,
781.768	you've given each other compliments.
785.97	Hold that compliment very, very tightly.
785.97	Hold it for later.
789.546	And the last thing, it was
789.546	extraordinarily profound,
793.98	and it happened only two weeks ago.
793.98	Two weeks ago I went back to the Himba.
797.659	Now, the Himba live in northern Namibia
797.659	on the border of Angola,
800.763	and I'd been there a few times before,
802.69	and I'd gone back
802.69	to present this book I'd made,
805.039	to show them the pictures,
805.039	to get into a discussion with them,
807.96	"to say, ""This is how I saw you."
807.96	This is how I love you.
810.83	This is how I respect you. What
810.83	"do you think? Am I right? Am I wrong?"""
814.143	So I wanted this debate.
814.143	It was very, very, very emotional,
817.216	and one night we were sitting
817.216	around the campfire,
819.657	and I have to be honest, I think I'd had
819.657	a little bit too much to drink,
823.279	and I was sort of sitting under the stars
823.279	"going, ""This is great,"
826.826	you've seen my pictures,
826.826	"we love each other."" (Laughter)"
829.45	And I'm a little bit slow,
832.592	and I looked around me, and I said,
834.503	I thought, maybe, the fence is missing.
836.805	Wasn't there a fence here
836.805	last time I came?
838.9	You know, this big
838.9	protective fence around the village,
841.958	and they sort of looked at me
841.958	"and go, ""Yeah, chief die."""
844.672	And I thought, okay,
844.672	chief dying, right, you know,
847.138	look up at the stars again,
847.138	look at the campfire.
849.529	Chief die. What on Earth does
849.529	chief die have to do with the fence?
853.399	"""Chief die."
856.416	First we destroy, yeah?
856.416	Then we reflect.
858.854	"Then we rebuild. Then we respect."""
862.708	And I burst out in tears, because
862.708	my father had only just died
866.656	prior to this journey,
868.49	and I didn't ever acknowledge him,
870.161	I didn't ever appreciate him for the fact
870.161	that I'm probably standing here today
874.12	because of him.
876.233	These people taught me that we are only
876.233	who we are because of our parents
881.259	and our grandparents
881.259	and our forefathers
883.535	going on and on and on before that,
885.346	and I, no matter how romantic
885.346	or how idealistic I am on this journey,
889.432	I did not know that until two weeks ago.
891.789	I did not know that until two weeks ago.
894.738	So what's this all about?
897.519	Well, there's an image
897.519	I'd like to show you,
899.776	quite a special image, and it wasn't
899.776	essentially the image I wanted to choose.
903.505	I was sitting there the other day,
903.505	and I have to finish on a strong image.
907.303	"And somebody said, ""You have to show"
907.303	"them the picture of the Nenets. The Nenets."""
911.162	I was like, yeah, but that's not
911.162	my favorite picture.
913.83	"She went, ""No no no no no no no."
913.83	It's an amazing picture.
916.528	"You're in his eyes."""
917.581	"I said, ""What do you mean I'm in his eyes?"
917.581	"It's a picture of the Nenets."""
921.12	"She said, ""No, look, look closely,"
921.12	"you're in his eyes."""
923.709	And when you look closely at this picture,
923.709	there is a reflection of me in his eyes,
927.871	so I think perhaps he has my soul,
927.871	and I'm in his soul,
931.26	and whilst these pictures look at you,
931.26	I ask you to look at them.
934.438	You may not be reflected in his eyes,
937.126	but there is something extraordinarily
937.126	important about these people.
940.502	I don't ultimately have the answers,
940.502	as I've just shared with you,
944.57	but you must do.
944.57	There must be something there.
946.818	So if you can briefly reflect
946.818	on what I was discussing
950.44	about beauty and about belonging
950.44	and about our ancestors and our roots,
955.641	and I need you all
955.641	to stand for me, please.
959.123	(Laughter)
961.068	Now you have no excuse.
961.068	It's almost lunchtime,
963.368	and this is not a standing ovation,
963.368	so don't worry,
965.902	I'm not fishing for compliments.
967.784	But you were given a compliment
967.784	a few minutes ago.
970.384	Now I want you to stand tall.
972.711	I want you to breathe in.
972.711	This is what I say.
974.895	I'm not going to get
974.895	on my knees for two weeks.
977.236	I'm not going to ask you
977.236	to carry a goat,
979.324	and I know you don't have any camels.
981.345	Photography's extraordinarily powerful.
983.219	It's this language which
983.219	we now all understand.
985.407	We truly do all understand it,
987.264	and we have this global
987.264	digital fireplace, don't we,
989.749	but I want to share you with the world,
991.72	because you are also a tribe.
993.185	You are the TED tribe, yeah?
993.185	But you have to remember that compliment.
996.493	You have to stand tall,
996.493	breathe in through your nose,
999.734	and I'm going to photograph you. Okay?
1001.702	I need to do a panoramic shot,
1001.702	so it's going to take a minute,
1004.646	so you have to concentrate, okay?
1006.227	Breathe in, stand tall, no laughing.
1006.227	Shh, breathe through your nose.
1009.496	I'm going to photograph.
1010.95	(Clicks)
1019.307	Thank you.
1021.536	(Applause)
