26	I'd like to do pretty much what I did the first time,
28	which is to choose a light-hearted theme.
31	Last time, I talked about death and dying.
34	This time, I'm going to talk about mental illness.
39	But it has to be technological,
40	so I'll talk about electroshock therapy. (Laughter)
45	You know, ever since man had any notion
48	that some of his other people, his colleagues,
52	could be different, could be strange, could be severely depressed
56	or what we now recognize as schizophrenia,
60	he was certain that this kind of illness
63	had to come from evil spirits getting into the body.
66	So, the way of treating these diseases
68	in early times was to, in some way or other,
71	exorcise those evil spirits, and this is still going on, as you know.
76	But it wasn't enough to use the priests.
78	When medicine became somewhat scientific, in about 450 BC,
83	with Hippocrates and those boys,
85	they tried to look for herbs, plants
89	that would literally shake the bad spirits out.
92	So, they found certain plants that could cause convulsions.
95	And the herbals, the botanical books of up to the late Middle Ages,
101	the Renaissance are filled with prescriptions
105	for causing convulsions to shake the evil spirits out.
110	Finally, in about the sixteenth century,
114	a physician whose name was Theophrastus Bombastus Aureolus von Hohenheim,
120	called Paracelsus, a name probably familiar to some people here --
124	(Laughter) -- good, old Paracelsus
129	found that he could predict the degree of convulsion
133	by using a measured amount of camphor to produce the convulsion.
137	Can you imagine going to your closet, pulling out a mothball, and
140	chewing on it if you're feeling depressed?
143	It's better than Prozac, but I wouldn't recommend it.
146	So what we see in the seventeenth, eighteenth century
149	is the continued search for medications other than camphor that'll do the trick.
154	Well, along comes Benjamin Franklin,
156	and he comes close to convulsing himself
158	with a bolt of electricity off the end of his kite.
162	And so people begin thinking in terms of electricity to produce convulsions.
167	And then, we fast-forward to about 1932,
171	when three Italian psychiatrists, who were largely treating depression,
177	began to notice among their patients, who were also epileptics,
180	that if they had an epileptic -- a series of epileptic fits,
183	a lot of them in a row -- the depression would very frequently lift.
187	Not only would it lift, but it might never return.
191	So they got very interested in producing convulsions,
196	measured types of convulsions.
198	"And they thought, ""Well, we've got electricity, we'll plug somebody into the wall."
201	"That always makes hair stand up and people shake a lot."""
204	So, they tried it on a few pigs, and none of the pigs were killed.
208	So, they went to the police and they said,
210	"""We know that at the Rome railroad station,"
213	there are all these lost souls wandering around,
215	"muttering gibberish. Can you bring one of them to us?"""
219	"Someone who is, as the Italians say, ""cagoots."""
222	"So they found this ""cagoots"" guy,"
224	a 39-year-old man who was really hopelessly schizophrenic,
227	who was known, had been known for months,
230	to be literally defecating on himself,
234	talking nothing that made any sense,
236	and they brought him into the hospital.
238	So these three psychiatrists, after about two or three weeks of observation,
242	laid him down on a table,
244	connected his temples to a very small source of current.
249	"They thought, ""Well, we'll try 55 volts, two-tenths of a second."
253	"That's not going to do anything terrible to him."""
256	So they did that.
257	Well, I have the following from a firsthand observer,
261	who told me this about 35 years ago,
264	when I was thinking about these things
266	for some research project of mine.
269	"He said, ""This fellow"" -- remember, he wasn't even put to sleep --"
273	"""after this major grand mal convulsion,"
275	sat right up, looked at these three fellas and said,
278	"'What the fuck are you assholes trying to do?' """
282	(Laughter)
290	If I could only say that in Italian.
293	Well, they were happy as could be, because he
296	hadn't said a rational word in the weeks of observation.
300	So they plugged him in again,
305	and this time they used 110 volts for half a second.
309	And to their amazement, after it was over,
312	he began speaking like he was perfectly well.
315	He relapsed a little bit, they gave him a series of treatments,
318	and he was essentially cured.
319	But of course, having schizophrenia,
322	within a few months, it returned.
324	But they wrote a paper about this,
326	and everybody in the Western world began using electricity
331	to convulse people who were either schizophrenic or severely depressed.
335	It didn't work very well on the schizophrenics,
337	but it was pretty clear in the '30s and by the middle of the '40s
340	that electroconvulsive therapy was very, very effective
346	in the treatment of depression.
348	And of course, in those days, there were no antidepressant drugs,
351	and it became very, very popular.
354	They would anesthetize people,
356	convulse them, but the real difficulty was
359	that there was no way to paralyze muscles.
361	So people would have a real grand mal seizure.
364	Bones were broken. Especially in old, fragile people,
367	you couldn't use it.
369	And then in the 1950s, late 1950s, the so-called muscle relaxants
374	were developed by pharmacologists,
376	and it got so that you could induce a complete convulsion,
380	an electroencephalographic convulsion -- you could see it on the brain waves --
383	without causing any convulsion in the body except a little bit of twitching of the toes.
388	So again, it was very, very popular and very, very useful.
394	Well, you know, in the middle '60s,
396	the first antidepressants came out. Tofranil was the first.
400	In the late '70s, early '80s, there were others,
404	and they were very effective.
405	And patients' rights groups seemed to get very upset
408	about the kinds of things that they would witness.
411	And so the whole idea of electroconvulsive, electroshock therapy disappeared,
417	but has had a renaissance in the last 10 years.
421	And the reason that it has had a renaissance
424	is that probably about 10 percent of the people, severe depressives,
430	do not respond, regardless of what is done for them.
435	Now, why am I telling you this story at this meeting?
439	I'm telling you this story, because actually ever since
442	Richard called me and asked me to talk about
444	-- as he asked all of his speakers --
446	to talk about something that would be new to this audience,
449	that we had never talked about, never written about,
452	I've been planning this moment.
455	This reason really is that I am a man who, almost 30 years ago,
460	had his life saved by two long courses of electroshock therapy.
468	And let me tell you this story.
472	I was, in the 1960s, in a marriage. To use the word bad
478	would be perhaps the understatement of the year.
481	It was dreadful.
483	There are, I'm sure, enough divorced people in this room
486	to know about the hostility, the anger, who knows what.
492	Being someone who had had a very difficult childhood,
497	a very difficult adolescence --
498	it had to do with not quite poverty but close.
502	It had to do with being brought up in a family where no one spoke English,
505	no one could read or write English.
507	It had to do with death and disease and lots of other things.
511	I was a little prone to depression.
513	So, as things got worse, as we really began to hate each other,
517	I became progressively depressed over a period of a couple of years,
521	trying to save this marriage,
523	which was inevitably not to be saved.
527	Finally, I would schedule -- all my major surgical cases,
533	I was scheduling them for 12, one o'clock in the afternoon,
537	because I couldn't get out of bed before about 11 o'clock.
541	And anybody who's been depressed here knows what that's like.
544	I couldn't even pull the covers off myself.
548	Well, you're in a university medical center,
550	where everybody knows everybody, and it's perfectly clear to my colleagues,
553	so my referrals began to decrease.
555	As my referrals began to decrease,
558	I clearly became increasingly depressed
562	until I thought, my God, I can't work anymore.
564	And, in fact, it didn't make any difference
566	because I didn't have any patients anymore.
568	So, with the advice of my physician,
572	I had myself admitted to the acute care psychiatric unit of our university hospital.
577	And my colleagues, who had known me since medical school
580	"in that place, said, ""Don't worry, chap. Six weeks,"
582	"you're back in the operating room. Everything's going to be great."""
586	Well, you know what bovine stercus is?
590	That proved to be a lot of bovine stercus.
596	I know some people who got tenure in that place with lies like that.
601	(Laughter)
607	So I was one of their failures.
610	But it wasn't that simple. Because by the time
612	I got out of that unit, I was not functional at all.
617	I could hardly see five feet in front of myself.
619	I shuffled when I walked. I was bowed over.
622	I rarely bathed. I sometimes didn't shave. It was dreadful.
627	And it was clear -- not to me,
630	because nothing was clear to me at that time anymore --
633	that I would need long-term hospitalization
637	in that awful place called a mental hospital.
641	So I was admitted, in 1973, in the spring of 1973,
647	to the Institute of Living, which used to be called the Hartford Retreat.
650	It was founded in the eighteenth century,
652	the largest psychiatric hospital in the state of
656	Connecticut, other than the huge public hospitals
658	that existed at that time.
661	And they tried everything they had.
662	They tried the usual psychotherapy.
664	They tried every medication available in those days.
667	And they did have Tofranil and other things -- Mellaril, who knows what.
671	Nothing happened except that I got jaundiced from one of these things.
675	And finally, because I was well known in Connecticut,
681	they decided they better have a meeting of the senior staff.
685	All the senior staff got together, and I later found out what happened.
691	They put all their heads together and they decided
695	that there was nothing that could be done
697	for this surgeon who had essentially separated himself from the world,
701	who by that time had become so overwhelmed,
705	not just with depression and feelings
708	of worthlessness and inadequacy,
710	but with obsessional thinking,
713	obsessional thinking about coincidences.
715	And there were particular numbers that every time I saw them,
718	just got me dreadfully upset -- all kinds of ritualistic observances,
724	just awful, awful stuff.
726	Remember when you were a kid, and you had to step on every line?
729	Well, I was a grown man who had all of these rituals,
733	and it got so there was a throbbing, there was a ferocious fear in my head.
737	You've seen this painting by Edvard Munch,
739	The Scream. Every moment was a scream.
744	It was impossible. So they decided there was no therapy,
747	there was no treatment. But there was one treatment,
750	which actually had been pioneered at the Hartford hospital in the early 1940s,
755	and you can imagine what it was. It was pre-frontal lobotomy.
763	So they decided -- I didn't know this, again,
765	I found this out later --
766	that the only thing that could be done was
768	for this 43-year-old man to have a pre-frontal
772	lobotomy.
775	Well, as in all hospitals, there was a resident
778	assigned to my case. He was 27 years old,
781	and he would meet with me two or three times a week.
783	And of course, I had been there, what, three or four months at the time.
787	And he asked to meet with the senior staff, and they agreed to meet with him
790	because he was very well thought of in that place.
792	They thought he had a really extraordinary future.
796	And he dug in his heels and said,
797	"""No. I know this man better than any of you. I have met with him over and over again."
801	You've just seen him from time to time. You've read reports and so forth.
805	I really honestly believe that the basic problem here is pure depression,
810	and all of the obsessional thinking comes out of it.
813	And you know, of course, what'll happen if you do a pre-frontal lobotomy.
816	Any of the results along the spectrum,
820	from pretty bad to terrible, terrible, terrible
822	is going to happen. If he does the best he can,
826	he will have no further obsessions,
828	probably no depression, but his affect will be dulled,
831	he will never go back to surgery,
833	he will never be the loving father that he was to his two children,
837	his life will be changed. If he has the usual result,
840	he will end up like 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'
843	"And you know about that, just essentially in a stupor the rest of his life."""
848	"Well, he said, ""Can't we try a course of electroshock therapy?"""
854	And you know why they agreed? They agreed to humor him.
857	"They just thought, ""Well, we'll give a course of 10."
861	"And so we'll lose a little time. Big deal. It doesn't make any difference."""
865	So they gave the course of 10,
866	and the first -- the usual course, incidentally, was six to eight
870	and still is six to eight.
872	Plugged me into the wires, put me to sleep, gave me the muscle relaxant.
876	Six didn't work. Seven didn't work.
878	Eight didn't work. At nine, I noticed --
881	and it's wonderful that I could notice anything
884	-- I noticed a change. And at 10, I noticed a real change.
888	And he went back to them, and they agreed to do another 10.
891	Again, not a single one of them
893	-- I think there are about seven or eight of them --
895	thought this would do any good. They thought this was a temporary change.
897	But, lo and behold, by 16, by 17,
901	there were demonstrable differences in the way I felt.
905	By 18 and 19, I was sleeping through the night.
908	And by 20, I had the sense, I really had the sense
912	that I could overcome this,
915	that I was now strong enough that by an act of will,
918	I could blow the obsessional thinking away.
920	I could blow the depression away.
923	And I've never forgotten -- I never will forget
926	-- standing in the kitchen of the unit,
929	it was a Sunday morning in January of 1974,
933	"standing in the kitchen by myself and thinking, ""I've got the strength now to do this."""
939	It was as though those tightly coiled wires in my head had been disconnected
944	and I could think clearly.
946	But I need a formula. I need some thing to say to myself
951	when I begin thinking obsessionally, obsessively.
955	Well, the Gilbert and Sullivan fans in this room
960	"will remember ""Ruddigore,"" and they will remember Mad Margaret,"
963	and they will remember that she was married
965	to a fellow named Sir Despard Murgatroyd.
969	And she used to go nuts, every five minutes or so in the play,
973	"and he said to her, ""We must have a word to bring you back to reality,"
976	"and the word, my dear, will be 'Basingstoke.'"""
980	So every time she got a little nuts,
982	"he would say, ""Basingstoke!"" And she would say,"
984	"""Basingstoke, it is."" And she would be fine for a little while."
988	"Well, you know, I'm from the Bronx. I can't say ""Basingstoke."""
992	But I had something better. And it was very simple.
996	"It was, ""Ah, fuck it!"""
999	"(Laughter) Much better than ""Basingstoke,"""
1004	at least for me. And it worked -- my God, it worked.
1008	Every time I would begin thinking obsessionally --
1010	again, once more, after 20 shock treatments
1014	"-- I would say, ""Ah, fuck it."""
1018	And things got better and better,
1020	and within three or four months,
1023	I was discharged from that hospital, and I joined a group of surgeons
1026	where I could work with other people in the community,
1030	not in New Haven, but fairly close by.
1033	I stayed there for three years.
1035	At the end of three years, I went back to New Haven,
1039	had remarried by that time.
1043	I brought my wife with me, actually, to make sure I could get through this.
1049	My children came back to live with us.
1055	We had two more children after that.
1058	Resuscitated the career, even better than it had been before.
1063	Went right back into the university
1067	and began to write books.
1070	Well, you know, it's been a wonderful life.
1073	It's been, as I said, close to 30 years.
1077	I stopped doing surgery about six years ago
1080	and became a full-time writer, as many people know.
1084	But it's been very exciting. It's been very happy.
1087	"Every once in a while, I have to say, ""Ah, fuck it."""
1089	Every once in a while, I get somewhat depressed and a little obsessional.
1092	So, I'm not free of all of this. But it's worked. It's always worked.
1102	Why have I chosen, after never, ever talking about this, to talk about it now?
1110	Well, those of you who know some of these books
1113	know that one is about death and dying,
1116	one is about the human body and the human spirit,
1118	one is about the way mystical thoughts are constantly in our minds,
1123	and they have always to do with my own personal experiences.
1128	One might think reading these books
1131	-- and I've gotten thousands of letters about them
1134	by people who do think this --
1136	that based on my life's history as I've portrayed in the books,
1139	my early life's history, I am someone who has overcome adversity.
1144	That I am someone who has drunk, drank, drunk
1149	of the bitter dregs of near-disaster in childhood
1156	and emerged not just unscathed but strengthened.
1161	I really have it figured out, so that I can advise people about
1164	death and dying, so that I can talk about mysticism and the human spirit.
1169	And I've always felt guilty about that.
1171	I've always felt that somehow I was an impostor
1174	because my readers don't know what I have just told you.
1179	It's known by some people in New Haven, obviously,
1182	but it is not generally known.
1184	So one of the reasons that I have come here to talk about this today
1189	is to -- frankly, selfishly --
1194	unburden myself and let it be known
1197	that this is not an untroubled mind that has written all of these books.
1203	But more importantly, I think,
1206	is the fact that a very significant proportion
1208	of people in this audience are under 30,
1212	and there are many, of course, who are well over 30.
1218	For people under 30, and it looks to me like almost all of you
1221	-- I would say all of you --
1222	are either on the cusp of a magnificent and exciting career
1227	or right into a magnificent and exciting career:
1231	anything can happen to you. Things change.
1235	Accidents happen. Something from childhood comes back to haunt you.
1239	You can be thrown off the track.
1241	I hope it happens to none of you,
1242	but it will probably happen to a small percentage of you.
1247	To those to whom it doesn't happen, there will be adversities.
1252	If I, with the bleakness of spirit,
1256	with no spirit, that I had in the 1970s
1261	and no possibility of recovery,
1263	as far as that group of very experienced psychiatrists thought,
1267	if I can find my way back from this,
1269	believe me, anybody can find their way back
1273	from any adversity that exists in their lives.
1278	And for those who are older, who have lived through
1279	perhaps not something as bad as this,
1282	but who have lived through difficult times,
1285	perhaps where they lost everything, as I did,
1287	and started out all over again, some of these things will seem very familiar.
1294	There is recovery.
1299	There is redemption. And there is resurrection.
1307	There are resurrection themes in every society that has ever been studied,
1311	and it is because not just only do we fantasize
1314	about the possibility of resurrection and recovery,
1317	but it actually happens. And it happens a lot.
1321	Perhaps the most popular resurrection theme,
1325	outside of specifically religious ones,
1328	is the one about the phoenix, the ancient story of the phoenix,
1332	who, every 500 years, resurrects itself from its own ashes
1339	to go on to live a life that is
1342	even more beautiful than it was before. Richard,
1345	thanks very much.
