26	This is a picture of Maurice Druon,
28	the Honorary Perpetual Secretary of L'Academie francaise,
32	the French Academy.
34	He is splendidly attired in his 68,000-dollar uniform,
39	befitting the role of the French Academy
42	as legislating the
45	correct usage in French
47	and perpetuating the language.
49	The French Academy has two main tasks:
52	it compiles a dictionary of official French.
55	They're now working on their ninth edition,
58	which they began in 1930, and they've reached the letter P.
62	They also legislate on correct usage,
65	"such as the proper term for what the French call ""email,"""
69	"which ought to be ""courriel."""
71	The World Wide Web, the French are told,
73	ought to be referred to as
75	"""la toile d'araignee mondiale"" -- the Global Spider Web --"
79	recommendations that the French gaily ignore.
84	Now, this is one model of how language comes to be:
88	namely, it's legislated by an academy.
91	But anyone who looks at language realizes
94	that this is a rather silly conceit,
98	that language, rather, emerges from human minds interacting from one another.
101	And this is visible in the unstoppable change in language --
105	the fact that by the time the Academy finishes their dictionary,
108	it will already be well out of date.
110	We see it in the
112	constant appearance of slang and jargon,
116	of the historical change in languages,
118	in divergence of dialects
120	and the formation of new languages.
123	So language is not so much a creator or shaper of human nature,
126	so much as a window onto human nature.
129	In a book that I'm currently working on,
132	I hope to use language to shed light on
135	a number of aspects of human nature,
137	including the cognitive machinery
139	with which humans conceptualize the world
142	and the relationship types that govern human interaction.
145	And I'm going to say a few words about each one this morning.
148	Let me start off with a technical problem in language
150	that I've worried about for quite some time --
152	and indulge me
156	in my passion for verbs and how they're used.
159	The problem is, which verbs go in which constructions?
162	The verb is the chassis of the sentence.
165	It's the framework onto which the other parts are bolted.
169	Let me give you a quick reminder
171	of something that you've long forgotten.
173	"An intransitive verb, such as ""dine,"" for example,"
176	can't take a direct object.
178	"You have to say, ""Sam dined,"" not, ""Sam dined the pizza."""
181	A transitive verb mandates
183	that there has to be an object there:
185	"""Sam devoured the pizza."" You can't just say, ""Sam devoured."""
188	There are dozens or scores of verbs of this type,
192	each of which shapes its sentence.
194	So, a problem in explaining how children learn language,
198	a problem in teaching language to adults so that they don't make grammatical errors,
203	and a problem in programming computers to use language is
206	which verbs go in which constructions.
209	For example, the dative construction in English.
211	"You can say, ""Give a muffin to a mouse,"" the prepositional dative."
214	"Or, ""Give a mouse a muffin,"" the double-object dative."
217	"""Promise anything to her,"" ""Promise her anything,"" and so on."
221	Hundreds of verbs can go both ways.
223	So a tempting generalization for a child,
225	for an adult, for a computer
227	is that any verb that can appear in the construction,
229	"""subject-verb-thing-to-a-recipient"""
232	"can also be expressed as ""subject-verb-recipient-thing."""
235	A handy thing to have,
237	because language is infinite,
239	and you can't just parrot back the sentences that you've heard.
242	You've got to extract generalizations
244	so you can produce and understand new sentences.
247	This would be an example of how to do that.
249	Unfortunately, there appear to be idiosyncratic exceptions.
252	"You can say, ""Biff drove the car to Chicago,"""
255	"but not, ""Biff drove Chicago the car."""
258	"You can say, ""Sal gave Jason a headache,"""
261	"but it's a bit odd to say, ""Sal gave a headache to Jason."""
264	The solution is that these constructions, despite initial appearance,
267	are not synonymous,
269	that when you crank up the microscope
271	on human cognition, you see that there's a subtle difference
273	in meaning between them.
275	"So, ""give the X to the Y,"""
277	that construction corresponds to the thought
280	"""cause X to go to Y."" Whereas ""give the Y the X"""
283	"corresponds to the thought ""cause Y to have X."""
287	Now, many events can be subject to either construal,
291	kind of like the classic figure-ground reversal illusions,
294	in which you can either pay attention
297	to the particular object,
299	in which case the space around it recedes from attention,
303	or you can see the faces in the empty space,
305	in which case the object recedes out of consciousness.
309	How are these construals reflected in language?
311	Well, in both cases, the thing that is construed as being affected
315	is expressed as the direct object,
317	the noun after the verb.
319	So, when you think of the event as causing the muffin to go somewhere --
323	where you're doing something to the muffin --
325	"you say, ""Give the muffin to the mouse."""
327	"When you construe it as ""cause the mouse to have something,"""
330	you're doing something to the mouse,
332	"and therefore you express it as, ""Give the mouse the muffin."""
335	So which verbs go in which construction --
337	the problem with which I began --
339	depends on whether the verb specifies a kind of motion
343	or a kind of possession change.
345	To give something involves both causing something to go
348	and causing someone to have.
350	To drive the car only causes something to go,
353	because Chicago's not the kind of thing that can possess something.
355	Only humans can possess things.
358	And to give someone a headache causes them to have the headache,
360	but it's not as if you're taking the headache out of your head
363	and causing it to go to the other person,
365	and implanting it in them.
367	You may just be loud or obnoxious,
369	or some other way causing them to have the headache.
371	So, that's
375	an example of the kind of thing that I do in my day job.
377	So why should anyone care?
379	Well, there are a number of interesting conclusions, I think,
382	from this and many similar kinds of analyses
386	of hundreds of English verbs.
388	First, there's a level of fine-grained conceptual structure,
391	which we automatically and unconsciously compute
394	every time we produce or utter a sentence, that governs our use of language.
398	"You can think of this as the language of thought, or ""mentalese."""
402	It seems to be based on a fixed set of concepts,
405	which govern dozens of constructions and thousands of verbs --
408	not only in English, but in all other languages --
411	fundamental concepts such as space,
413	time, causation and human intention,
416	such as, what is the means and what is the ends?
419	These are reminiscent of the kinds of categories
421	that Immanuel Kant argued
423	are the basic framework for human thought,
426	and it's interesting that our unconscious use of language
429	seems to reflect these Kantian categories.
432	Doesn't care about perceptual qualities,
434	such as color, texture, weight and speed,
436	which virtually never differentiate
438	the use of verbs in different constructions.
441	An additional twist is that all of the constructions in English
444	are used not only literally,
446	but in a quasi-metaphorical way.
449	For example, this construction, the dative,
451	is used not only to transfer things,
453	but also for the metaphorical transfer of ideas,
456	"as when we say, ""She told a story to me"""
458	"or ""told me a story,"""
460	"""Max taught Spanish to the students"" or ""taught the students Spanish."""
463	It's exactly the same construction,
465	but no muffins, no mice, nothing moving at all.
469	It evokes the container metaphor of communication,
472	in which we conceive of ideas as objects,
474	sentences as containers,
476	and communication as a kind of sending.
478	"As when we say we ""gather"" our ideas, to ""put"" them ""into"" words,"
481	"and if our words aren't ""empty"" or ""hollow,"""
483	"we might get these ideas ""across"" to a listener,"
486	"who can ""unpack"" our words to ""extract"" their ""content."""
489	And indeed, this kind of verbiage is not the exception, but the rule.
492	It's very hard to find any example of abstract language
495	that is not based on some concrete metaphor.
498	"For example, you can use the verb ""go"""
501	"and the prepositions ""to"" and ""from"""
503	in a literal, spatial sense.
505	"""The messenger went from Paris to Istanbul."""
507	"You can also say, ""Biff went from sick to well."""
510	He needn't go anywhere. He could have been in bed the whole time,
513	but it's as if his health is a point in state space
515	that you conceptualize as moving.
517	"Or, ""The meeting went from three to four,"""
519	in which we conceive of time as stretched along a line.
522	"Likewise, we use ""force"" to indicate"
525	not only physical force,
527	"as in, ""Rose forced the door to open,"""
529	but also interpersonal force,
531	"as in, ""Rose forced Sadie to go,"" not necessarily by manhandling her,"
535	but by issuing a threat.
537	"Or, ""Rose forced herself to go,"""
539	as if there were two entities inside Rose's head,
542	engaged in a tug of a war.
544	Second conclusion is that the ability to conceive
547	of a given event in two different ways,
550	"such as ""cause something to go to someone"""
552	"and ""causing someone to have something,"""
554	I think is a fundamental feature of human thought,
558	and it's the basis for much human argumentation,
561	in which people don't differ so much on the facts
564	as on how they ought to be construed.
566	Just to give you a few examples:
568	"""ending a pregnancy"" versus ""killing a fetus;"""
570	"""a ball of cells"" versus ""an unborn child;"""
573	"""invading Iraq"" versus ""liberating Iraq;"""
575	"""redistributing wealth"" versus ""confiscating earnings."""
579	And I think the biggest picture of all
581	would take seriously the fact
584	that so much of our verbiage about abstract events
587	is based on a concrete metaphor
589	and see human intelligence itself
591	as consisting of a repertoire of concepts --
594	such as objects, space, time, causation and intention --
597	which are useful in a social, knowledge-intensive species,
601	whose evolution you can well imagine,
603	and a process of metaphorical abstraction
606	that allows us to bleach these concepts
608	of their original conceptual content --
611	space, time and force --
614	and apply them to new abstract domains,
616	therefore allowing a species that evolved
619	to deal with rocks and tools and animals,
621	to conceptualize mathematics, physics, law
624	and other abstract domains.
627	Well, I said I'd talk about two windows on human nature --
630	the cognitive machinery with which we conceptualize the world,
633	and now I'm going to say a few words about the relationship types
635	that govern human social interaction,
637	again, as reflected in language.
640	And I'll start out with a puzzle, the puzzle of indirect speech acts.
644	"Now, I'm sure most of you have seen the movie ""Fargo."""
646	And you might remember the scene in which
648	the kidnapper is pulled over by a police officer,
651	is asked to show his driver's license
653	and holds his wallet out
655	with a 50-dollar bill extending
658	at a slight angle out of the wallet.
660	"And he says, ""I was just thinking"
662	"that maybe we could take care of it here in Fargo,"""
664	which everyone, including the audience,
667	interprets as a veiled bribe.
670	This kind of indirect speech is rampant in language.
674	For example, in polite requests,
676	"if someone says, ""If you could pass the guacamole,"
678	"that would be awesome,"""
680	we know exactly what he means,
682	even though that's a rather bizarre
684	concept being expressed.
686	(Laughter)
689	"""Would you like to come up and see my etchings?"""
691	I think most people
693	understand the intent behind that.
696	And likewise, if someone says,
698	"""Nice store you've got there. It would be a real shame if something happened to it"" --"
701	(Laughter) --
702	we understand that as a veiled threat,
704	rather than a musing of hypothetical possibilities.
707	So the puzzle is, why are bribes,
710	polite requests, solicitations and threats so often veiled?
713	No one's fooled.
715	Both parties know exactly what the speaker means,
718	and the speaker knows the listener knows
720	that the speaker knows that the listener knows, etc., etc.
723	So what's going on?
725	I think the key idea is that language
727	is a way of negotiating relationships,
729	and human relationships fall into a number of types.
732	There's an influential taxonomy by the anthropologist Alan Fiske,
736	in which relationships can be categorized, more or less,
739	into communality, which works on the principle
741	"""what's mine is thine, what's thine is mine,"""
744	the kind of mindset that operates within a family, for example;
748	"dominance, whose principle is ""don't mess with me;"""
751	"reciprocity, ""you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours;"""
755	"and sexuality, in the immortal words of Cole Porter, ""Let's do it."""
760	Now, relationship types can be negotiated.
763	Even though there are default situations
766	in which one of these mindsets can be applied,
768	they can be stretched and extended.
771	For example, communality applies most naturally
774	within family or friends,
776	but it can be used to try to transfer
778	the mentality of sharing
780	to groups that ordinarily would not be disposed to exercise it.
784	For example, in brotherhoods, fraternal organizations,
788	"sororities, locutions like ""the family of man,"""
791	you try to get people who are not related
793	to use the relationship type that would ordinarily
797	be appropriate to close kin.
799	Now, mismatches -- when one person assumes one relationship type,
802	and another assumes a different one -- can be awkward.
805	If you went over and you helped yourself
807	to a shrimp off your boss' plate,
809	for example, that would be an awkward situation.
811	Or if a dinner guest after the meal
813	pulled out his wallet and offered to pay you for the meal,
816	that would be rather awkward as well.
818	In less blatant cases,
821	there's still a kind of negotiation that often goes on.
824	In the workplace, for example,
826	there's often a tension over whether an employee
828	can socialize with the boss,
830	or refer to him or her
832	on a first-name basis.
834	If two friends have a
836	reciprocal transaction, like selling a car,
838	it's well known that this can be a source
840	of tension or awkwardness.
842	In dating, the transition
844	from friendship to sex
846	can lead to, notoriously, various forms of awkwardness,
849	and as can sex in the workplace,
851	in which we call the conflict between a
853	"dominant and a sexual relationship ""sexual harassment."""
857	Well, what does this have to do with language?
859	Well, language, as a social interaction,
861	has to satisfy two conditions.
863	You have to convey the actual content --
866	here we get back to the container metaphor.
868	You want to express the bribe, the command, the promise,
871	the solicitation and so on,
873	but you also have to negotiate
875	and maintain the kind of relationship
877	you have with the other person.
879	The solution, I think, is that we use language at two levels:
882	the literal form signals
884	the safest relationship with the listener,
886	whereas the implicated content --
889	the reading between the lines that we count on the listener to perform --
892	allows the listener to derive the interpretation
894	which is most relevant in context,
896	which possibly initiates a changed relationship.
899	The simplest example of this is in the polite request.
903	If you express your request as a conditional --
906	"""if you could open the window, that would be great"" --"
909	even though the content is an imperative,
911	the fact that you're not using the imperative voice
914	means that you're not acting as if you're in a relationship of dominance,
918	where you could presuppose the compliance of the other person.
921	On the other hand, you want the damn guacamole.
923	By expressing it as an if-then statement,
926	you can get the message across
928	without appearing to boss another person around.
932	And in a more subtle way, I think, this works
934	for all of the veiled speech acts
936	involving plausible deniability:
938	the bribes, threats, propositions,
940	solicitations and so on.
942	One way of thinking about it is to imagine what it would be like
944	if language -- where it could only be used literally.
947	And you can think of it in terms of a
949	game-theoretic payoff matrix.
952	Put yourself in the position of the
954	kidnapper wanting to bribe the officer.
957	There's a high stakes
959	in the two possibilities
962	of having a dishonest officer or an honest officer.
965	If you don't bribe the officer,
968	then you will get a traffic ticket --
970	"or, as is the case of ""Fargo,"" worse --"
972	whether the honest officer
974	is honest or dishonest.
976	Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
978	In that case, the consequences are rather severe.
981	On the other hand, if you extend the bribe,
983	if the officer is dishonest,
985	you get a huge payoff of going free.
988	If the officer is honest, you get a huge penalty
991	of being arrested for bribery.
993	So this is a rather fraught situation.
995	On the other hand, with indirect language,
997	if you issue a veiled bribe,
999	then the dishonest officer
1001	could interpret it as a bribe,
1003	in which case you get the payoff of going free.
1006	The honest officer can't hold you to it as being a bribe,
1009	and therefore, you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket.
1012	So you get the best of both worlds.
1015	And a similar analysis, I think,
1017	can apply to the potential awkwardness
1019	of a sexual solicitation,
1021	and other cases where plausible deniability is an asset.
1024	I think this affirms
1026	something that's long been known by diplomats --
1028	namely, that the vagueness of language,
1030	far from being a bug or an imperfection,
1033	actually might be a feature of language,
1036	one that we use to our advantage in social interactions.
1039	So to sum up: language is a collective human creation,
1042	reflecting human nature,
1044	how we conceptualize reality,
1046	how we relate to one another.
1048	And then by analyzing the various quirks and complexities of language,
1052	I think we can get a window onto what makes us tick.
1055	Thank you very much.
1056	(Applause)
