26	You know, there's a small country nestled in the Himalayan Mountains,
30	far from these beautiful mountains, where the people
32	of the Kingdom of Bhutan have decided to do something different,
35	which is to measure their gross national happiness
38	rather than their gross national product.
40	And why not?
42	After all, happiness is not just a privilege for the lucky few,
46	but a fundamental human right for all.
49	And what is happiness?
51	Happiness is the freedom of choice.
53	The freedom to chose where to live,
55	what to do, what to buy, what to sell,
58	from whom, to whom, when and how.
62	Where does choice come from?
65	And who gets to express it, and how do we express it?
68	Well, one way to express choice is through the market.
73	Well-functioning markets provide choices, and ultimately,
76	the ability to express one's pursuit for happiness.
81	The great Indian economist, Amartya Sen, was awarded the Nobel prize
88	for demonstrating that famine is not so much about
91	the availability of food supply, but rather the ability to acquire
95	or entitle oneself to that food through the market.
99	In 1984, in what can only be considered one of the
103	greatest crimes of humanity, nearly one million people died of starvation
107	in my country of birth, Ethiopia.
109	Not because there was not enough food --
111	because there was actually a surplus of food
114	in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country --
118	but because in the north, people could not access
120	or entitle themselves to that food.
122	That was a turning point for my life.
124	Most Africans today, by far, are farmers.
127	And most of Africa's farmers are, by and large,
131	small farmers in terms of land that they operate, and very, very small
135	farmers in terms of the capital they have at their disposal.
139	African agriculture today is among, or is, the most under-capitalized in the world.
145	Only seven percent of arable land in Africa is irrigated,
150	compared to 40 percent in Asia.
152	African farmers only use some 22 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare,
159	compared to 144 in Asia.
163	Road density is six times greater in Asia than it is in rural Africa.
168	There are eight times more tractors in Latin America,
171	and three times more tractors in Asia, than in Africa.
176	The small farmer in Africa today lives a life without much choice,
180	and therefore without much freedom.
182	His livelihood is predetermined
184	by the conditions of grinding poverty.
187	He comes to the market when prices are lowest,
190	with the meager fruits of his hard labor, just after the harvest,
193	because he has no choice.
195	She comes back to the market
198	some months later, when prices are highest, in what we call
201	the lean season -- when food is scarce --
204	because she has to feed her family and has no choice.
210	The real question is, how can markets be developed in rural Africa
215	to harness the power of innovation and entrepreneurship
218	that we know exists?
220	Another notable economist, Theodore Schultz,
225	in 1974 won the Nobel prize for demonstrating that farmers
229	are efficient, but poor.
231	Meaning, in fact, that farmers are rational
234	and profit-minded just like everybody else.
236	Well, we don't need, now,
239	any more Nobel prizes to know that farmers want a fair shake
242	at the market and want to make money, just like everyone else.
246	And one thing is clear, which is at least now we know
250	that Africa is open for business.
252	And that business is agriculture.
256	Over two decades ago, the world insisted to Africa that markets
260	must be liberalized, that economies must be structurally adjusted.
265	This meant that governments were to remove themselves
267	from the business of buying and selling --
269	which they did rather inefficiently --
271	and let the private market do its magic.
274	Well, what happened over the last 25 years?
277	Did Africa feed itself?
279	Did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors?
283	I think we're all in this room,
286	probably, because we know that, in fact, Africa is the only region
290	in the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up
294	over the next 10 years,
296	where the food import bill is now double
299	what it was 20 years ago,
301	where food production per capita has
305	stagnated, and where fertilizer use has declined rather than increased.
311	So why didn't agriculture markets perform to expectations?
314	The market reforms prompted by the West --
316	and I've spent some 15 years traveling around the continent
321	doing research on agricultural markets, and have interviewed
324	traders in 10 to 15 countries in this continent, hundreds of traders --
329	trying to understand what went wrong with our market reform.
334	And it seems to me that the reforms might have
338	thrown the baby out with the bath water.
340	Like its agriculture,
342	Africa's markets are highly under-capitalized and inefficient.
346	We know from our work around the continent
348	that transaction costs of reaching the market,
351	and the risks of transacting in rural, agriculture markets,
355	are extremely high.
357	In fact, only one third of agricultural output
360	produced in Africa even reaches the market.
363	Africa's markets are weak not only because of weak infrastructure
367	in terms of roads and telecommunications, but also because
371	of the virtual absence of necessary market institutions, such as
375	market information, grades and standards,
379	and reliable ways to connect buyers and sellers.
382	Because of this, commodity buyers and sellers typically transact in small circles,
387	in narrow networks of people they know and trust.
391	And because of that, as grain changes hands --
395	and I've measured that it changes hands four, five times in
399	its trajectory from the farmer to the consumer --
402	every time it changes hands -- and I've seen this all over rural Africa --
406	it also changes sacks.
408	And I thought that was incredibly peculiar.
410	And really realized that that was because -- as traders would tell me
413	over and over -- that's the only way people know what they're getting
416	in terms of the quantity and the product quality.
420	And that actually has huge implications
423	for the ability of markets to quickly respond to price signals,
428	and situations where there are deficits, for example.
431	It also has very high cost implications.
434	I have measured that 26 percent of the marketing margin
437	is simply due to the fact that, because of the absence
439	of grades and standards and market information,
443	sacks have to be constantly changed.
446	And this leads to very high handling costs.
449	For their part, small farmers, who produce the bulk of our agricultural output in Africa,
454	come to the market with virtually no information at all -- blind --
458	trusting that they're going to have
461	some sort of demand for their produce,
464	and completely at the mercy of the merchants
468	in the only market, the nearest local market they know --
472	where they're unable to negotiate better prices or reduce their risk.
475	Speaking of risk, we have seen that price volatility
479	of food crops in Africa is the highest in the world.
481	In Africa, small farmers bear the brunt of this risk.
485	In fact, in my view, there is no region of the world and no period in history
494	that farmers have been expected to bear the kind of market risk
495	that Africa's farmers have to bear.
498	And in my view, there is simply no place in the world
500	that has grown its agriculture on the kind of risk
504	that our farmers in Africa today face.
507	In Ethiopia, for example, the variation in maize prices
511	from year to year is as much as 50 percent annually.
514	This kind of market risk is mind-boggling, and has direct implications
518	for not only the incentives of farmers to invest
522	in higher productivity technology, such as modern seeds and fertilizers,
527	but also direct implications for food security.
530	To give you an example, between 2001 and 2002,
534	Ethiopian maize farmers produced two years of bumper harvest.
537	That in turn, because of the weak marketing system,
540	led to an 80 percent collapse in maize prices in the country.
545	This made it unprofitable for some farmers to even harvest the grain from the fields.
550	And we calculated that some 300,000 tons of grain
553	was left in the fields to rot in early 2002.
557	Not six months later, in July 2002, Ethiopia announced a major food crisis,
563	to the same proportions as 1984: 14 million people at risk of starvation.
568	What also happened that year
571	is in the areas where there were good rains, and where farmers
575	had previously produced surplus grain, farmers had decided
579	to withdraw from the fertilizer market, not use fertilizer
583	and actually had dropped their use of fertilizer by 27 percent.
587	This is a tragic example of arrested development,
593	or a budding green revolution stopped in its tracks.
596	And this is not just specific to Ethiopia,
598	but happens over and over, all over Africa.
602	Well, I'm not here today to lament about the situation, or wring my hands.
609	I am here to tell you that change is in the air.
613	Africa today is not the Africa waiting for aid solutions,
617	or cookie-cutter foreign expert policy prescriptions.
621	Africa has learned, or is learning somewhat slowly,
625	that markets don't happen by themselves.
628	In the 1980s, it was very fashionable
631	to talk about getting prices right.
633	There was a very influential book about that,
635	which was mainly about getting governments out of the market.
639	We now recognize that getting markets right is about not just
643	price incentives, but also investing in the right infrastructure
647	and the appropriate and necessary institutions to create
650	the conditions to unleash the power of innovation in the market.
655	When conditions are right, we know and see
658	that that innovation is ready to explode in rural Africa,
662	just like anywhere else.
664	Nearly three years ago, I decided to leave my comfortable job
668	as a World Bank senior economist in Washington
671	and come back to my country of birth, Ethiopia,
673	after nearly 30 years abroad.
675	I did so for a simple reason.
677	After having spent more than a decade
681	understanding, studying, and trying to convince policymakers and donors
686	about what was wrong with Africa's agricultural markets,
688	I decided it was time to do something about it.
692	I currently lead, in Ethiopia, an exciting new initiative
697	to establish the first Ethiopia Commodity Exchange, or ECX.
701	Now, the commodity exchange itself, that concept,
705	is not new to the world.
707	In fact, in 1848, 82 grain merchants and farmers got together
711	in a small town at the crossroads of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan
716	to establish a way to trade better amongst themselves.
722	That was, of course, the birth of the Chicago Board of Trade,
726	which is the most famous commodity exchange in the world.
730	The Chicago Board of Trade was established then
732	for precisely the same reasons
734	that our farmers today would benefit from a commodity exchange.
739	In the American Midwest, farmers used to load grain onto barges
742	and send it upriver to the Chicago market.
745	But once it arrived, if no buyer was to be found,
750	or if prices suddenly dropped, farmers would incur tremendous losses.
755	And in fact, would even dump the grain in Lake Michigan,
757	rather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms.
761	Well, the need to avoid these huge risks and tremendous losses
766	led to the birth of the futures market, and the underlying system
769	of grading grain and receipting -- issuing warehouse receipts
773	on the basis of which trade could be done.
775	From there, the greatest innovation of all came about in this market,
781	which is that buyers and sellers could transact grain
784	without actually having to physically or visually inspect the grain.
789	That meant that grain could be traded across tremendous distances,
792	and even across time -- as far forward as 18 months into the future.
797	This innovation is at the heart of the transformation of American agriculture,
801	and the rise of Chicago to a global market,
805	agricultural market, superpower from where it was, a small regional town.
810	Now, over the last century,
813	we tend to think of commodity exchanges as the purview
816	of Western industrialized countries,
818	and that the reference prices for cotton, coffee, cocoa --
821	products produced mainly in the south --
824	are actually a reference price, or a price discovered in these
829	organized commodity exchanges in the northern countries.
833	But that is actually changing.
835	And we're seeing a shift --
837	powered mainly because of information technology --
840	a shift in market dominance towards the emerging markets.
843	And over the last decade, you see that the share of Western exchanges --
848	and this is the U.S. share of exchanges in the world --
854	has gone down by nearly half in just the last decade.
857	Similarly, there's been explosive growth in India, for example,
861	where rural farmers are using exchanges -- growing here
865	over the last three years by 270 percent a year.
870	This is powered by low-cost VSAT technology,
873	aggressively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market.
877	China's Dalian Commodity Exchange, three years ago,
884	the second largest commodity exchange in the world.
888	Now, in Ethiopia, we're in the process of designing
892	the first organized Ethiopia Commodity Exchange.
895	We're not trying to cut and paste the Chicago model
898	or the India model, but creating a system uniquely tailored
901	to Ethiopia's needs and realities,
903	Ethiopia's small farmers.
905	So, the ECX is an Ethiopian exchange for Ethiopia.
908	We're creating a system that serves all market actors,
912	that creates integrity, trust, efficiency, transparency
918	and enables small farmers to manage the risks that I have described.
922	In the design of our commodity exchange in Ethiopia,
925	we've done something rather unique, which is to
927	take the approach of an integrated perspective,
929	or what we call the ECX Edge.
932	The ECX Edge pretty much creates the entire ecosystem
936	in which the market will develop itself.
939	And this is because one of the things we've learned
942	over the last decade of studying market development in Africa
945	is that the piecemeal approach does not work.
948	You've got one donor trying to develop market information,
951	another trying to work on or sponsor grades and standards,
955	another ICT, and yet another on warehousing, or warehouse receipts.
961	In our approach in Ethiopia,
963	we've decided to put together the entire ecosystem,
967	or environment, in which trade takes place.
970	That means that the exchange will operate a trading system,
974	which will initially start as an open outcry,
978	because we don't think the country's ready for full electronic trading.
981	But at the same time, we'll do something which I think no exchange
983	in the world has ever done, which is itself to operate something like
988	an Internet cafe in the rural areas.
990	So that farmers and small traders
993	can actually come to a terminal center -- what we call
996	the remote access terminal centers -- and actually,
999	without having to buy a computer or figure out how to dial up
1001	or any of those things, simply see the trading
1004	that's happening on the Addis Ababa trading floor.
1008	At the same time, what's very fundamental to this market is that --
1011	and again, an innovation that we've designed for our exchange --
1015	is that the exchange will operate warehouses around the country,
1018	in which grade certification and warehouse receipting will be done.
1022	And in turn, we'll operate an in-house clearing system,
1025	to assure that payment is done appropriately,
1029	in the right amount and at the right time,
1032	so that basically, we create trust and integrity in the system.
1036	Obviously, we work with exchange actors,
1039	and as we're developing the exchange market itself,
1042	we're also developing the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework,
1046	the overarching legal framework for making this market work.
1049	So, in fact, our proclamation
1052	is going to parliament next month.
1055	What's really important is that the ECX will operate a market information system
1060	to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country,
1064	using VSAT technology to bring an electronic price dissemination
1069	directly to farmers.
1071	What this does is transforms, fundamentally,
1074	the farmers' relationship to the market.
1077	Whereas before the farmer used to think local --
1080	meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market,
1083	eight to 10 kilometers away on average,
1085	and sell whatever they happened to have,
1087	without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was --
1091	now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market.
1095	And they start to think national, and even global.
1098	They start to make not only commercial marketing decisions,
1102	but also planting decisions, on the basis of information
1105	coming from the futures price market.
1109	And they come to the market knowing what grades their products
1113	will achieve in terms of a price premium.
1116	So all of this will transform farmers.
1118	It will also transform the way traders do business.
1121	It will stop them from doing simple, back-to-back, limited arbitrage
1127	to really thinking strategically about how to move grain
1130	across long distances from [surplus regions] to [deficit areas].
1134	Can Ethiopia do this?
1137	It seems very ambitious.
1139	But it will create new opportunities.
1141	We believe that this initiative requires great political will,
1144	and we'll have to align the financial sector, as well as the ICT sector,
1149	and really even the underlying legal framework.
1153	We believe that the winds of change are here, and that we can do it.
1157	ECX is the market for Ethiopia's new millennium,
1161	which starts in about eight months.
1165	The last parliament of our century opened with our president
1169	announcing to the country that this was the most important
1172	economic initiative for the country today.
1174	We believe that the stakes are high,
1177	but that the returns will be even greater.
1180	ECX, moreover, can become a trading platform for a pan-African market
1185	in agricultural commodities.
1187	Ethiopia's domestic market is about one billion dollars of value.
1191	And we feel that over the next five years,
1195	if Ethiopia can capture even 40 percent, just 40 percent, of the domestic market,
1201	and add just 25 percent value to that market, the value of the market doubles.
1206	Ethiopia's agricultural market is 30 percent higher
1209	than South Africa's grain production,
1213	and, in fact, Ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in Africa.
1216	So the potential is there.
1218	The will is there.
1220	The commitment is there.
1222	So we feel that we have a winning value proposition
1226	to transform farmers' choices, to grow our agriculture,
1230	and to change Africa.
1232	So, we are in the business of finding our happiness.
1236	Thank you very much.
1237	(Applause)
