15.89	So raise your hand if you know someone
19.118	in your immediate family or circle of friends
21.765	who suffers from some form of mental illness.
25.253	Yeah. I thought so. Not surprised.
28.037	And raise your hand if you think that
30.332	basic research on fruit flies has anything to do
33.157	with understanding mental illness in humans.
37.619	Yeah. I thought so. I'm also not surprised.
40.412	I can see I've got my work cut out for me here.
43.732	As we heard from Dr. Insel this morning,
46.32	psychiatric disorders like autism, depression and schizophrenia
50.533	take a terrible toll on human suffering.
53.408	We know much less about their treatment
56.621	and the understanding of their basic mechanisms
59.227	than we do about diseases of the body.
61.846	Think about it: In 2013,
64.489	the second decade of the millennium,
66.444	if you're concerned about a cancer diagnosis
68.809	and you go to your doctor, you get bone scans,
71.328	biopsies and blood tests.
74.256	In 2013, if you're concerned about a depression diagnosis,
78.121	you go to your doctor, and what do you get?
80.084	A questionnaire.
82.071	Now, part of the reason for this is that we have
84.5	an oversimplified and increasingly outmoded view
88.323	of the biological basis of psychiatric disorders.
92.21	We tend to view them --
93.453	and the popular press aids and abets this view --
96.298	as chemical imbalances in the brain,
99.314	as if the brain were some kind of bag of chemical soup
102.998	full of dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine.
107.198	This view is conditioned by the fact
109.525	that many of the drugs that are prescribed to treat these disorders,
112.931	like Prozac, act by globally changing brain chemistry,
117.602	as if the brain were indeed a bag of chemical soup.
121.578	But that can't be the answer,
123.479	because these drugs actually don't work all that well.
126.716	A lot of people won't take them, or stop taking them,
129.892	because of their unpleasant side effects.
132.549	These drugs have so many side effects
134.609	because using them to treat a complex psychiatric disorder
138.565	is a bit like trying to change your engine oil
141.254	by opening a can and pouring it all over the engine block.
145.367	Some of it will dribble into the right place,
147.517	but a lot of it will do more harm than good.
150.618	Now, an emerging view
152.856	that you also heard about from Dr. Insel this morning,
155.806	is that psychiatric disorders are actually
158.376	disturbances of neural circuits that mediate
161.85	emotion, mood and affect.
165.369	When we think about cognition,
167.131	we analogize the brain to a computer. That's no problem.
170.707	Well it turns out that the computer analogy
173.288	is just as valid for emotion.
175.671	It's just that we don't tend to think about it that way.
178.457	But we know much less about the circuit basis
181.74	of psychiatric disorders
183.639	because of the overwhelming dominance
185.709	of this chemical imbalance hypothesis.
189.061	Now, it's not that chemicals are not important
192.888	in psychiatric disorders.
194.425	It's just that they don't bathe the brain like soup.
198.397	Rather, they're released in very specific locations
202.046	and they act on specific synapses
204.771	to change the flow of information in the brain.
208.459	So if we ever really want to understand
210.896	the biological basis of psychiatric disorders,
213.601	we need to pinpoint these locations in the brain
216.633	where these chemicals act.
218.367	Otherwise, we're going to keep pouring oil all over our mental engines
221.846	and suffering the consequences.
224.803	Now to begin to overcome our ignorance
227.862	of the role of brain chemistry in brain circuitry,
231.396	it's helpful to work on what we biologists call
234.076	"""model organisms,"""
235.655	animals like fruit flies and laboratory mice,
238.989	in which we can apply powerful genetic techniques
242.414	to molecularly identify and pinpoint
246.039	specific classes of neurons,
247.602	as you heard about in Allan Jones's talk this morning.
250.505	Moreover, once we can do that,
252.966	we can actually activate specific neurons
255.715	or we can destroy or inhibit the activity of those neurons.
259.926	So if we inhibit a particular type of neuron,
262.64	and we find that a behavior is blocked,
265.105	we can conclude that those neurons
267.319	are necessary for that behavior.
270.283	On the other hand, if we activate a group of neurons
272.665	and we find that that produces the behavior,
275.479	we can conclude that those neurons are sufficient for the behavior.
279.553	So in this way, by doing this kind of test,
282.562	we can draw cause and effect relationships
286.085	between the activity of specific neurons
288.441	in particular circuits and particular behaviors,
291.354	something that is extremely difficult, if not impossible,
293.791	to do right now in humans.
298.842	But can an organism like a fruit fly, which is --
301.679	it's a great model organism
303.879	because it's got a small brain,
306.417	it's capable of complex and sophisticated behaviors,
310.204	it breeds quickly, and it's cheap.
313.354	But can an organism like this
315.149	teach us anything about emotion-like states?
318.992	Do these organisms even have emotion-like states,
322.292	or are they just little digital robots?
325.655	Charles Darwin believed that insects have emotion
328.855	and express them in their behaviors, as he wrote
331.405	in his 1872 monograph on the expression of the emotions in man and animals.
336.598	And my eponymous colleague, Seymour Benzer, believed it as well.
340.117	Seymour is the man that introduced the use of drosophila
343.531	here at CalTech in the '60s as a model organism
347.054	to study the connection between genes and behavior.
350.651	Seymour recruited me to CalTech in the late 1980s.
354.258	He was my Jedi and my rabbi while he was here,
358.692	and Seymour taught me both to love flies
361.08	and also to play with science.
364.129	So how do we ask this question?
367.245	It's one thing to believe that flies have emotion-like states,
371.305	but how do we actually find out whether that's true or not?
374.468	Now, in humans we often infer emotional states,
378.418	as you'll hear later today, from facial expressions.
382.323	However, it's a little difficult to do that in fruit flies.
386.043	(Laughter)
389.356	It's kind of like landing on Mars
392.493	and looking out the window of your spaceship
395.198	at all the little green men who are surrounding it
397.668	"and trying to figure out, ""How do I find out"
400.074	"if they have emotions or not?"""
402.429	What can we do? It's not so easy.
405.972	Well, one of the ways that we can start
408.157	is to try to come up with some general characteristics
412.282	or properties of emotion-like states
416.03	such as arousal, and see if we can identify
419.494	any fly behaviors that might exhibit some of those properties.
424.87	So three important ones that I can think of
427.69	are persistence, gradations in intensity, and valence.
432.362	Persistence means long-lasting.
434.696	We all know that the stimulus that triggers an emotion
438.657	causes that emotion to last long after the stimulus is gone.
443.673	Gradations of intensity means what it sounds like.
446.763	You can dial up the intensity or dial down the intensity of an emotion.
451.346	If you're a little bit unhappy, the corners of your mouth
453.946	turn down and you sniffle,
455.633	and if you're very unhappy, tears pour down your face
458.771	and you might sob.
460.603	Valence means good or bad, positive or negative.
464.982	So we decided to see if flies could be provoked into showing
469.434	the kind of behavior that you see
471.885	by the proverbial wasp at the picnic table,
474.695	you know, the one that keeps coming back to your hamburger
477.38	the more vigorously you try to swat it away,
479.909	and it seems to keep getting irritated.
482.193	So we built a device, which we call a puff-o-mat,
485.84	in which we could deliver little brief air puffs to fruit flies
490.185	in these plastic tubes in our laboratory bench
492.961	and blow them away.
494.686	And what we found is that if we gave these flies
497.925	in the puff-o-mat several puffs in a row,
500.773	they became somewhat hyperactive
503.462	and continued to run around for some time after the air puffs actually stopped
507.897	and took a while to calm down.
510.761	So we quantified this behavior
512.95	using custom locomotor tracking software
515.962	developed with my collaborator Pietro Perona,
518.762	who's in the electrical engineering division here at CalTech.
522.374	And what this quantification showed us is that,
525.188	upon experiencing a train of these air puffs,
528.412	the flies appear to enter a kind of state of hyperactivity
532.726	which is persistent, long-lasting,
535.324	and also appears to be graded.
537.828	More puffs, or more intense puffs,
540.687	make the state last for a longer period of time.
544.6	So now we wanted to try to understand something
546.636	about what controls the duration of this state.
550.35	So we decided to use our puff-o-mat
553.201	and our automated tracking software
555.256	to screen through hundreds of lines of mutant fruit flies
559.038	to see if we could find any that showed abnormal responses to the air puffs.
564.117	And this is one of the great things about fruit flies.
566.464	There are repositories where you can just pick up the phone
569.257	and order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants
572.898	and screen them in your assay and then find out
575.07	what gene is affected in the mutation.
578.389	So doing the screen, we discovered one mutant
581.901	that took much longer than normal to calm down
585.375	after the air puffs,
587.652	and when we examined the gene that was affected in this mutation,
591.602	it turned out to encode a dopamine receptor.
595.207	That's right -- flies, like people, have dopamine,
598.218	and it acts on their brains and on their synapses
600.99	through the same dopamine receptor molecules
603.54	that you and I have.
605.929	Dopamine plays a number of important functions in the brain,
609.415	including in attention, arousal, reward,
612.528	and disorders of the dopamine system have been linked
615.941	to a number of mental disorders including drug abuse,
619.041	Parkinson's disease, and ADHD.
623.275	Now, in genetics, it's a little counterintuitive.
626.065	We tend to infer the normal function of something
629.325	by what doesn't happen when we take it away,
633.035	by the opposite of what we see when we take it away.
636.038	So when we take away the dopamine receptor
639.051	and the flies take longer to calm down,
641.608	from that we infer that the normal function of this receptor and dopamine
645.454	is to cause the flies to calm down faster after the puff.
649.939	And that's a bit reminiscent of ADHD,
652.889	which has been linked to disorders of the dopamine system in humans.
656.864	Indeed, if we increase the levels of dopamine in normal flies
661.47	by feeding them cocaine
663.18	after getting the appropriate DEA license
666.152	— oh my God -- (Laughter) —
670.152	we find indeed that these cocaine-fed flies
673.324	calm down faster than normal flies do,
676.366	and that's also reminiscent of ADHD,
679.565	which is often treated with drugs like Ritalin
681.61	that act similarly to cocaine.
684.629	So slowly I began to realize that what started out
687.778	as a rather playful attempt to try to annoy fruit flies
691.427	might actually have some relevance to a human psychiatric disorder.
695.403	Now, how far does this analogy go?
697.629	As many of you know, individuals afflicted with ADHD
700.751	also have learning disabilities.
703.088	Is that true of our dopamine receptor mutant flies?
706.654	Remarkably, the answer is yes.
709.374	As Seymour showed back in the 1970s,
712.002	flies, like songbirds, as you just heard,
714.453	are capable of learning.
716.186	You can train a fly to avoid an odor, shown here in blue,
720.629	if you pair that odor with a shock.
723.017	Then when you give those trained flies the chance to choose
726.401	between a tube with the shock-paired odor and another odor,
729.555	it avoids the tube containing the blue odor that was paired with shock.
733.755	Well, if you do this test on dopamine receptor mutant flies,
737.257	they don't learn. Their learning score is zero.
739.722	They flunk out of CalTech.
743.533	So that means that these flies have two abnormalities,
748.281	or phenotypes, as we geneticists call them,
751.331	that one finds in ADHD: hyperactivity and learning disability.
756.843	Now what's the causal relationship, if anything, between these phenotypes?
761.206	In ADHD, it's often assumed that the hyperactivity
765.119	causes the learning disability.
767.025	The kids can't sit still long enough to focus, so they don't learn.
770.744	But it could equally be the case that it's the learning disabilities
774.04	that cause the hyperactivity.
775.912	Because the kids can't learn, they look for other things to distract their attention.
780.382	And a final possibility is that there's no relationship at all
783.439	between learning disabilities and hyperactivity,
785.843	but that they are caused by a common underlying mechanism in ADHD.
790.758	Now people have been wondering about this for a long time
793.1	in humans, but in flies we can actually test this.
796.588	And the way that we do this is to delve deeply into the mind
799.672	of the fly and begin to untangle its circuitry using genetics.
803.938	We take our dopamine receptor mutant flies
806.4	and we genetically restore, or cure, the dopamine receptor
810.964	by putting a good copy of the dopamine receptor gene
814.199	back into the fly brain.
816.25	But in each fly, we put it back only into certain neurons
820.085	and not in others, and then we test each of these flies
823.799	for their ability to learn and for hyperactivity.
827.467	Remarkably, we find we can completely dissociate these two abnormalities.
832.285	If we put a good copy of the dopamine receptor back
834.948	in this elliptical structure called the central complex,
837.909	the flies are no longer hyperactive, but they still can't learn.
841.986	On the other hand, if we put the receptor back in a different structure
844.712	called the mushroom body,
846.23	the learning deficit is rescued, the flies learn well,
849.315	but they're still hyperactive.
851.145	What that tells us is that dopamine
853.395	is not bathing the brain of these flies like soup.
856.787	Rather, it's acting to control two different functions
859.949	on two different circuits,
861.583	so the reason there are two things wrong with our dopamine receptor flies
865.487	is that the same receptor is controlling two different functions
869.662	in two different regions of the brain.
872.525	Whether the same thing is true in ADHD in humans
875.587	we don't know, but these kinds of results
877.963	should at least cause us to consider that possibility.
881.44	So these results make me and my colleagues more convinced than ever
885.413	that the brain is not a bag of chemical soup,
888.825	and it's a mistake to try to treat complex psychiatric disorders
892.352	just by changing the flavor of the soup.
895.063	What we need to do is to use our ingenuity and our scientific knowledge
899.28	to try to design a new generation of treatments
901.988	that are targeted to specific neurons and specific regions of the brain
906.276	that are affected in particular psychiatric disorders.
909.614	If we can do that, we may be able to cure these disorders
912.814	without the unpleasant side effects,
914.861	putting the oil back in our mental engines,
917.607	just where it's needed. Thank you very much.
