12.493	When the Industrial Revolution started,
15.015	the amount of carbon sitting
15.015	underneath Britain in the form of coal
19.908	was as big as the amount of carbon
19.908	sitting under Saudi Arabia
23.107	in the form of oil.
25.431	This carbon powered
25.431	the Industrial Revolution,
27.99	"it put the ""Great"" in Great Britain,"
29.729	and led to Britain's temporary
29.729	world domination.
34.085	And then, in 1918,
34.085	coal production in Britain peaked,
38.53	and has declined ever since.
41.003	In due course, Britain started using
41.003	oil and gas from the North Sea,
45.08	and in the year 2000,
47.015	oil and gas production
47.015	from the North Sea also peaked,
50.538	and they're now on the decline.
54.136	These observations about the finiteness
56.823	of easily accessible, local,
56.823	secure fossil fuels,
61.427	is a motivation for saying,
61.427	"""Well, what's next?"
64.738	What is life after fossil fuels
64.738	going to be like?
67.348	Shouldn't we be thinking hard
67.348	"about how to get off fossil fuels?"""
70.838	Another motivation,
70.838	of course, is climate change.
74.314	And when people talk
74.314	about life after fossil fuels
76.839	and climate change action,
78.85	I think there's a lot of fluff,
81.304	a lot of greenwash,
81.304	a lot of misleading advertising,
84.192	and I feel a duty as a physicist to try
84.192	to guide people around the claptrap
88.705	and help people understand the actions
88.705	that really make a difference,
92.503	and to focus on ideas that do add up.
97.01	Let me illustrate this
98.613	with what physicists call
98.613	a back-of-envelope calculation.
102.228	We love back-of-envelope calculations.
104.097	You ask a question,
104.097	write down some numbers,
106.192	and get an answer.
107.379	It may not be very accurate,
107.379	"but it may make you say, ""Hmm."""
110.603	So here's a question:
112.049	"Imagine if we said, ""Oh yes,"
112.049	we can get off fossil fuels.
115.276	We'll use biofuels. Problem solved.
116.968	"Transport ... We don't need oil anymore."""
119.272	Well, what if we grew
119.272	the biofuels for a road
125.73	on the grass verge
125.73	at the edge of the road?
129.274	How wide would the verge
129.274	have to be for that to work out?
133.511	OK, so let's put in some numbers.
135.183	Let's have our cars go
135.183	at 60 miles per hour.
137.917	Let's say they do 30 miles per gallon.
139.751	That's the European average for new cars.
142.939	Let's say the productivity
142.939	of biofuel plantations
145.287	is 1,200 liters of biofuel
145.287	per hectare per year.
148.411	That's true of European biofuels.
151.351	And let's imagine the cars are spaced
154.915	and they're perpetually
154.915	going along this road.
157.115	The length of the road doesn't matter,
158.979	because the longer the road,
158.979	the more biofuel plantation.
161.734	What do we do with these numbers?
163.346	Take the first number, divide by the other
163.346	three, and get eight kilometers.
167.399	And that's the answer.
168.579	That's how wide the plantation
168.579	would have to be,
170.963	given these assumptions.
173.296	"And maybe that makes you say, ""Hmm."
176.053	Maybe this isn't going
176.053	"to be quite so easy."""
180.23	And it might make you think,
182.862	perhaps there's an issue to do with areas.
185.291	And in this talk, I'd like to talk
185.291	about land areas, and ask:
189.212	Is there an issue about areas?
190.719	The answer is going to be yes,
190.719	but it depends which country you are in.
195.403	So let's start in the United Kingdom,
197.465	since that's where we are today.
199.781	The energy consumption
199.781	of the United Kingdom,
202.15	the total energy consumption --
202.15	not just transport, but everything --
206.558	I like to quantify it in lightbulbs.
208.388	It's as if we've all got
215.594	is the energy consumption of the UK.
218.688	So there's 40 lightbulbs'
218.688	worth for transport,
223.154	and 40 lightbulbs' worth
223.154	for making electricity,
225.706	and other things are relatively small,
227.644	compared to those three big fish.
230.301	It's actually a bigger footprint
230.301	if we take into account
233.055	the embodied energy in the stuff
233.055	we import into our country as well.
236.701	And 90 percent of this energy, today,
236.701	still comes from fossil fuels,
241.459	and 10 percent, only, from other,
241.459	greener -- possibly greener -- sources,
245.161	like nuclear power and renewables.
248.233	So.
249.542	That's the UK.
250.823	The population density of the UK
250.823	is 250 people per square kilometer.
256.068	I'm now going to show you other countries
256.068	by these same two measures.
259.354	On the vertical axis, I'm going
259.354	to show you how many lightbulbs --
262.514	what our energy consumption per person is.
264.978	We're at 125 lightbulbs per person,
267.121	and that little blue dot there
267.121	is showing you the land area
270.759	of the United Kingdom.
272.473	The population density
272.473	is on the horizontal axis,
275.286	and we're 250 people per square kilometer.
278.033	Let's add European countries in blue,
280.626	and you can see there's quite a variety.
283.151	I should emphasize,
283.151	both of these axes are logarithmic;
286.252	as you go from one gray bar
286.252	to the next gray bar,
288.831	you're going up a factor of 10.
291.547	Next, let's add Asia in red,
293.912	the Middle East and North Africa in green,
297.413	sub-Saharan Africa in blue,
300.925	black is South America,
304.394	purple is Central America,
306.985	and then in pukey-yellow,
306.985	we have North America,
309.812	Australia and New Zealand.
312.45	You can see the great diversity
312.45	of population densities
315.374	and of per capita consumptions.
318.317	Countries are different from each other.
320.58	Top left, we have Canada and Australia,
320.58	with enormous land areas,
324.16	very high per capita consumption --
328.672	and very low population densities.
332.33	Top right: Bahrain has
332.33	the same energy consumption
335.516	per person, roughly, as Canada --
337.523	over 300 lightbulbs per person,
339.789	but their population density
339.789	is a factor of 300 times greater,
342.835	1,000 people per square kilometer.
344.688	Bottom right: Bangladesh has
344.688	the same population density as Bahrain,
349.589	but consumes 100 times less per person.
353.179	Bottom left: well, there's no one.
355.686	But there used to be
355.686	a whole load of people.
357.806	Here's another message from this diagram.
359.783	I've added on little blue tails
359.783	behind Sudan, Libya,
363.173	China, India, Bangladesh.
364.708	That's 15 years of progress.
366.867	Where were they 15 years ago,
366.867	and where are they now?
369.412	And the message is,
370.594	most countries are going to the right,
370.594	and they're going up.
373.491	Up and to the right:
373.491	bigger population density
375.662	and higher per capita consumption.
377.626	So, we may be off in the top
377.626	right-hand corner, slightly unusual,
381.605	the United Kingdom accompanied by Germany,
384.016	Japan, South Korea, the Netherlands,
386.01	and a bunch of other
386.01	slightly odd countries,
388.399	but many other countries are coming
388.399	up and to the right to join us.
392.728	So we're a picture, if you like,
394.795	of what the future energy consumption
396.794	might be looking
396.794	like in other countries, too.
400.973	I've also added in this diagram
400.973	now some pink lines
403.916	that go down and to the right.
405.829	Those are lines of equal
405.829	power consumption per unit area,
409.694	which I measure in watts per square meter.
411.789	So, for example, the middle line there,
411.789	0.1 watts per square meter,
415.66	is the energy consumption
415.66	per unit area of Saudi Arabia,
419.536	Norway, Mexico in purple,
419.536	and Bangladesh 15 years ago.
424.637	Half of the world's population
424.637	lives in countries
427.85	that are already above that line.
431.71	The United Kingdom is consuming
431.71	1.25 watts per square meter.
436.926	So is Germany, and Japan
436.926	is consuming a bit more.
441.258	So, let's now say why this is relevant.
445.212	Why is it relevant?
446.623	Well, we can measure
446.623	renewables in the same units
449.513	and other forms of power
449.513	production in the same units.
452.728	Renewables is one of the leading ideas
455.495	for how we could get off
455.495	our 90 percent fossil-fuel habit.
459.802	So here come some renewables.
461.238	Energy crops deliver
461.238	half a watt per square meter
463.922	in European climates.
466.709	What does that mean?
467.884	You might have anticipated that result,
469.89	given what I told you about the biofuel
469.89	plantation a moment ago.
473.102	Well, we consume 1.25 watts
473.102	per square meter.
476.122	What this means is,
477.303	even if you covered the whole
477.303	of the United Kingdom with energy crops,
480.714	you couldn't match
480.714	today's energy consumption.
484.636	Wind power produces a bit more --
484.636	2.5 watts per square meter.
488.494	But that's only twice as big
488.494	as 1.25 watts per square meter.
493.043	So that means if you wanted, literally,
493.043	to produce total energy consumption
497.189	in all forms, on average, from wind farms,
499.444	you need wind farms
499.444	half the area of the UK.
503.579	I've got data to back up
503.579	all these assertions, by the way.
507.643	Next, let's look at solar power.
510.119	Solar panels, when you put them on a roof,
512.161	deliver about 20 watts
512.161	per square meter in England.
517.9	If you really want to get
517.9	a lot from solar panels,
520.306	you need to adopt the traditional
520.306	Bavarian farming method,
523.134	where you leap off the roof,
524.509	and coat the countryside
524.509	with solar panels, too.
527.037	Solar parks, because of the gaps
527.037	between the panels, deliver less.
530.257	They deliver about 5 watts
530.257	per square meter of land area.
533.688	And here's a solar park
533.688	in Vermont, with real data,
537.014	delivering 4.2 watts per square meter.
540.061	Remember where we are,
540.061	1.25 watts per square meter,
542.992	wind farms 2.5, solar parks about five.
546.897	So whichever of those renewables you pick,
550.351	the message is, whatever mix
550.351	of those renewables you're using,
553.924	if you want to power the UK on them,
556.129	you're going to need
556.129	to cover something like
561.136	with those renewables.
563.15	I'm not saying that's a bad idea;
563.15	we just need to understand the numbers.
566.686	I'm absolutely not anti-renewables.
566.686	I love renewables.
569.282	But I'm also pro-arithmetic.
570.942	(Laughter)
572.671	Concentrating solar power in deserts
572.671	delivers larger powers per unit area,
576.827	because you don't have
576.827	the problem of clouds.
579.202	So, this facility delivers
582.43	this one 10 watts per square meter;
584.165	and this one in Spain,
584.165	5 watts per square meter.
586.945	Being generous
586.945	to concentrating solar power,
589.143	I think it's perfectly credible it could
589.143	deliver 20 watts per square meter.
592.831	So that's nice.
594.021	Of course, Britain
594.021	doesn't have any deserts.
596.955	Yet.
598.135	(Laughter)
599.844	So here's a summary so far:
603.035	All renewables, much
603.035	as I love them, are diffuse.
605.683	They all have a small power per unit area,
607.746	and we have to live with that fact.
610.271	And that means, if you do want renewables
610.271	to make a substantial difference
615.587	for a country like the United Kingdom
617.399	on the scale of today's consumption,
619.515	you need to be imagining renewable
619.515	facilities that are country-sized.
623.94	Not the entire country,
625.277	but a fraction of the country,
625.277	a substantial fraction.
629.684	There are other options
629.684	for generating power as well,
632.255	which don't involve fossil fuels.
633.963	So there's nuclear power,
633.963	and on this ordinance survey map,
637.142	you can see there's a Sizewell B
637.142	inside a blue square kilometer.
640.905	That's one gigawatt in a square kilometer,
642.932	which works out to 1,000 watts
642.932	per square meter.
645.381	So by this particular metric,
647.541	nuclear power isn't
647.541	as intrusive as renewables.
653.322	Of course, other metrics matter, too,
655.341	and nuclear power has
655.341	all sorts of popularity problems.
658.964	But the same goes for renewables as well.
661.025	Here's a photograph of a consultation
661.025	exercise in full swing
663.877	in the little town of Penicuik
663.877	just outside Edinburgh,
666.589	and you can see the children
666.589	of Penicuik celebrating
669.107	the burning of the effigy of the windmill.
671.501	So --
672.684	(Laughter)
673.758	People are anti-everything,
675.111	and we've got to keep
675.111	all the options on the table.
678.328	What can a country like the UK
678.328	do on the supply side?
681.991	Well, the options are,
681.991	I'd say, these three:
684.934	power renewables,
686.136	and recognizing that they need
686.136	to be close to country-sized;
689.871	other people's renewables,
691.141	so we could go back and talk very politely
693.292	to the people in the top left-hand side
693.292	of the diagram and say,
696.353	"""Uh, we don't want"
696.353	renewables in our backyard,
698.628	but, um, please could we put
698.628	"them in yours instead?"""
701.246	And that's a serious option.
703.235	It's a way for the world
703.235	to handle this issue.
706.843	So countries like Australia,
706.843	Russia, Libya, Kazakhstan,
710.999	could be our best friends
710.999	for renewable production.
715.356	And a third option is nuclear power.
717.416	So that's some supply-side options.
719.656	In addition to the supply levers
719.656	that we can push --
722.972	and remember, we need large amounts,
725.031	because at the moment, we get 90 percent
725.031	of our energy from fossil fuels --
728.582	in addition to those levers,
729.966	we could talk about other ways
729.966	of solving this issue.
733.041	Namely, we could reduce demand,
733.041	and that means reducing population --
736.461	I'm not sure how to do that --
738.3	or reducing per capita consumption.
741.136	So let's talk about three more big levers
743.623	that could really help
743.623	on the consumption side.
745.973	First, transport.
747.151	Here are the physics principles
748.718	that tell you how to reduce
748.718	the energy consumption of transport.
751.792	People often say,
751.792	"""Technology can answer everything."
754.262	We can make vehicles
754.262	"that are 100 times more efficient."""
757.062	And that's almost true. Let me show you.
759.066	The energy consumption
759.066	of this typical tank here
761.558	is 80 kilowatt hours
761.558	per hundred person kilometers.
765.006	That's the average European car.
769.347	Eighty kilowatt hours.
770.522	Can we make something 100 times better
772.634	by applying the physics
772.634	principles I just listed?
774.971	Yes. Here it is. It's the bicycle.
776.638	It's 80 times better
776.638	in energy consumption,
779.308	and it's powered by biofuel, by Weetabix.
781.556	(Laughter)
783.718	And there are other options in between,
785.609	because maybe the lady
785.609	in the tank would say,
787.76	"""No, that's a lifestyle change."
787.76	"Don't change my lifestyle, please."""
790.94	We could persuade her to take a train,
790.94	still a lot more efficient than a car,
794.611	but that might be a lifestyle change.
796.41	Or there's the EcoCAR, top-left.
798.018	It comfortably accommodates one teenager
798.018	and it's shorter than a traffic cone,
801.777	and it's almost as efficient as a bicycle,
803.837	as long as you drive it
803.837	at 15 miles per hour.
807.299	In between, perhaps
807.299	some more realistic options
809.55	on the transport lever
809.55	are electric vehicles,
812.539	so electric bikes
812.539	and electric cars in the middle,
814.942	perhaps four times as energy efficient
814.942	as the standard petrol-powered tank.
820.778	Next, there's the heating lever.
822.7	Heating is a third of our energy
822.7	consumption in Britain,
826.215	and quite a lot of that
826.215	is going into homes
828.312	and other buildings,
829.719	doing space heating and water heating.
831.72	So here's a typical crappy British house.
834.028	It's my house, with a Ferrari out front.
836.771	(Laughter)
837.86	What can we do to it?
839.037	Well, the laws of physics
839.037	are written up there,
842.722	which describe how the power
842.722	consumption for heating
847.994	is driven by the things you can control.
849.926	The things you can control
849.926	are the temperature difference
852.844	between the inside and the outside.
854.551	There's this remarkable technology
854.551	called a thermostat:
857.189	you grasp it, rotate it to the left,
858.949	and your energy consumption
858.949	in the home will decrease.
861.502	I've tried it. It works.
861.502	Some people call it a lifestyle change.
864.629	(Laughter)
865.737	You can also get the fluff men
865.737	in to reduce the leakiness
869.241	of your building -- put fluff
869.241	in the walls, fluff in the roof,
872.234	a new front door, and so forth.
875.452	The sad truth is,
875.452	this will save you money.
878.061	That's not sad, that's good.
879.425	But the sad truth is,
880.627	it'll only get about 25 percent
880.627	of the leakiness of your building
883.85	if you do these things,
883.85	which are good ideas.
886.569	If you really want to get a bit closer
886.569	to Swedish building standards
889.852	with a crappy house like this,
891.526	you need to be putting
891.526	external insulation on the building,
894.996	as shown by this block of flats in London.
898.652	You can also deliver heat
898.652	more efficiently using heat pumps,
901.681	which use a smaller bit
901.681	of high-grade energy like electricity
905.175	to move heat from your garden
905.175	into your house.
908.676	The third demand-side option
908.676	I want to talk about,
911.07	the third way to reduce energy
911.07	consumption is: read your meters.
914.24	People talk a lot about smart meters,
916.093	but you can do it yourself.
917.464	Use your own eyes and be smart.
919.413	Read your meter, and if you're anything
919.413	like me, it'll change your life.
923.1	Here's a graph I made.
924.556	I was writing a book
924.556	about sustainable energy,
926.724	and a friend asked me,
927.902	"""How much energy do you use at home?"""
929.74	I was embarrassed; I didn't actually know.
931.784	And so I started reading
931.784	the meter every week.
934.009	The old meter readings are shown
934.009	in the top half of the graph,
937.825	and then 2007 is shown
937.825	in green at the bottom.
940.074	That was when I was reading
940.074	the meter every week.
942.42	And my life changed,
943.61	because I started doing experiments
943.61	and seeing what made a difference.
946.989	My gas consumption plummeted,
948.418	because I started tinkering
948.418	with the thermostat
950.661	and the timing on the heating system,
952.484	and I knocked more than half
952.484	off my gas bills.
954.721	There's a similar story
954.721	for my electricity consumption,
957.628	where switching off the DVD
957.628	players, the stereos,
961.214	the computer peripherals
961.214	that were on all the time,
964.032	and just switching them on
964.032	when I needed them,
966.251	knocked another third
966.251	off my electricity bills, too.
970.142	So we need a plan that adds up.
971.932	I've described for you six big levers.
974.546	We need big action,
975.736	because we get 90 percent
975.736	of our energy from fossil fuels,
978.522	and so you need to push hard
978.522	on most, if not all, of these levers.
983.288	Most of these levers
983.288	have popularity problems,
985.598	and if there is a lever
985.598	you don't like the use of,
989.288	well, please do bear in mind
989.288	that means you need even stronger effort
993.129	on the other levers.
995.456	So I'm a strong advocate
995.456	of having grown-up conversations
998.631	that are based on numbers and facts.
1000.916	And I want to close with this map
1000.916	that just visualizes for you
1004.716	the requirement of land and so forth
1008.277	in order to get just
1011.365	from four of the big possible sources.
1014.474	So, if you wanted to get 16 lightbulbs --
1017.658	remember, today our total energy
1017.658	consumption is 125 lightbulbs' worth --
1022.003	if you wanted 16 from wind,
1024.25	this map visualizes a solution for the UK.
1027.101	It's got 160 wind farms,
1027.101	each 100 square kilometers in size,
1031.282	and that would be a twentyfold increase
1031.282	over today's amount of wind.
1035.19	Nuclear power:
1035.19	to get 16 lightbulbs per person,
1038.122	you'd need two gigawatts
1038.122	at each of the purple dots on the map.
1041.235	That's a fourfold increase
1041.235	over today's levels of nuclear power.
1046.069	Biomass: to get 16 lightbulbs per person,
1048.791	you'd need a land area something
1048.791	like three and a half Wales' worth,
1053.823	either in our country,
1053.823	or in someone else's country,
1056.429	possibly Ireland, possibly somewhere else.
1058.496	(Laughter)
1059.599	And a fourth supply-side option:
1061.414	concentrating solar power
1061.414	in other people's deserts.
1064.554	If you wanted to get 16 lightbulbs' worth,
1067.017	then we're talking
1067.017	about these eight hexagons
1070.056	down at the bottom right.
1071.391	The total area of those hexagons
1071.391	is two Greater London's worth
1075.64	of someone else's Sahara,
1077.753	and you'll need power lines
1077.753	all the way across Spain and France
1080.784	to bring the power
1080.784	from the Sahara to Surrey.
1084.595	(Laughter)
1085.769	We need a plan that adds up.
1088.295	We need to stop shouting
1088.295	and start talking.
1092.209	And if we can have
1092.209	a grown-up conversation,
1096.456	make a plan that adds up and get building,
1098.941	maybe this low-carbon revolution
1098.941	will actually be fun.
1101.969	Thank you very much for listening.
1103.731	(Applause)
