12.16	Ladies and gentlemen,
14.16	the history of music and television on the Internet
17.16	in three minutes.
19.16	A TED medley --
21.16	a TEDley.
26.16	♫ It's nine o' clock on a Saturday ♫
29.16	♫ The record store's closed for the night ♫
32.16	♫ So I fire up the old iTunes music store ♫
36.16	♫ And soon I am feelin' all right ♫
42.16	♫ I know Steve Jobs can find me a melody ♫
45.16	♫ With one dollar pricing that rocks ♫
48.16	♫ I can type in the track and get album names back ♫
52.16	♫ While still in my PJs and socks ♫
58.16	♫ Sell us a song, you're the music man ♫
61.16	♫ My iPod's still got 10 gigs to go ♫
64.16	♫ Yes, we might prefer more compatibility ♫
67.16	♫ But Steve likes to run the whole show ♫
73.16	"♫ I heard ""Desperate Housewives"" was great last night ♫"
76.16	♫ But I had a bad piece of cod ♫
79.16	"♫ As I threw up my meal, I thought, ""It's no big deal"" ♫"
83.16	♫ I'll watch it tonight on my 'Pod ♫
87.16	♫ And now all of the networks are joining in ♫
91.16	♫ Two bucks a show without ads ♫
94.16	♫ It's a business those guys always wanted to try ♫
97.16	♫ But only Steve Jobs had the 'nads ♫
102.16	♫ They say we're young, don't watch TV ♫
106.16	♫ They say the Internet is all we see ♫
112.16	♫ But that's not true; they've got it wrong ♫
115.16	♫ See, all our shows are just two minutes long ♫
122.16	♫ Hey ♫
126.16	♫ I got YouTube ♫
128.16	♫ I got YouTube ♫
132.16	And now, ladies and gentlemen,
134.16	a tribute to the Recording Industry Association of America --
137.16	the RIAA!
143.16	♫ Young man, you were surfin' along ♫
146.16	♫ And then, young man, you downloaded a song ♫
149.16	♫ And then, dumb man, copied it to your 'Pod ♫
152.16	♫ Then a phone call came to tell you ... ♫
160.16	♫ You've just been sued by the R-I-A-A ♫
163.16	♫ You've just been screwed by the R-I-A-A ♫
168.16	♫ Their attorneys say you committed a crime ♫
172.16	♫ And there'd better not be a next time ♫
175.16	♫ They've lost their minds at the R-I-A-A ♫
178.16	♫ Justice is blind at the R-I-A-A ♫
181.16	♫ You're depriving the bands ♫
184.16	♫ You are learning to steal ♫
186.16	♫ You can't do whatever you feel ♫
191.16	♫ CD sales have dropped every year ♫
194.16	♫ They're not greedy, they're just quaking with fear ♫
197.16	♫ Yes indeedy, what if their end is near ♫
200.16	♫ And we download all our music ♫
207.16	♫ Yeah, that would piss off the R-I-A-A ♫
210.16	♫ No plastic discs from the R-I-A-A ♫
215.16	♫ What a way to make friends ♫
218.16	♫ It's a plan that can't fail ♫
220.16	♫ All your customers off to jail ♫
223.16	♫ Who'll be next for the R-I-A-A? ♫
226.16	♫ What else is vexing the R-I-A-A? ♫
229.16	♫ Maybe whistling a tune ♫
231.16	♫ Maybe humming along ♫
234.16	♫ Maybe mocking 'em in a song ♫
