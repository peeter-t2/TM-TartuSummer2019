12.856	I am in search of another planet
12.856	in the universe where life exists.
18.426	I can't see this planet
18.426	with my naked eyes
21.412	or even with the most powerful telescopes
23.722	we currently possess.
25.787	But I know that it's there.
27.875	And understanding contradictions
27.875	that occur in nature
31.042	will help us find it.
33.379	On our planet,
34.554	where there's water, there's life.
36.892	So we look for planets that orbit
36.892	at just the right distance
39.85	from their stars.
42.418	At this distance,
43.593	shown in blue on this diagram
43.593	for stars of different temperatures,
47.097	planets could be warm enough
47.097	for water to flow on their surfaces
50.975	as lakes and oceans
52.397	where life might reside.
54.787	Some astronomers focus their time
54.787	and energy on finding planets
58.525	at these distances from their stars.
60.99	What I do picks up where their job ends.
63.869	I model the possible
63.869	climates of exoplanets.
67.353	And here's why that's important:
69.203	there are many factors
69.203	besides distance from its star
72.717	that control whether
72.717	a planet can support life.
76.297	Take the planet Venus.
78.646	It's named after the Roman goddess
78.646	of love and beauty,
82.361	because of its benign,
82.361	ethereal appearance in the sky.
86.487	But spacecraft measurements
86.487	revealed a different story.
90.08	The surface temperature is close
90.08	to 900 degrees Fahrenheit,
96.151	That's hot enough to melt lead.
99.115	Its thick atmosphere, not its distance
99.115	from the sun, is the reason.
102.977	It causes a greenhouse effect on steroids,
106.104	trapping heat from the sun
106.104	and scorching the planet's surface.
110.181	The reality totally contradicted
110.181	initial perceptions of this planet.
115.728	From these lessons
115.728	from our own solar system,
118.373	we've learned that a planet's atmosphere
120.413	is crucial to its climate
120.413	and potential to host life.
124.967	We don't know what the atmospheres
124.967	of these planets are like
127.906	because the planets are so small
127.906	and dim compared to their stars
132.298	and so far away from us.
134.5	For example, one of the closest planets
134.5	that could support surface water --
138.815	it's called Gliese 667 Cc --
142.196	such a glamorous name, right,
142.196	nice phone number for a name --
146.156	it's 23 light years away.
149.091	So that's more than 100 trillion miles.
152.686	Trying to measure
152.686	the atmospheric composition
155.023	of an exoplanet passing
155.023	in front of its host star is hard.
159.444	It's like trying to see a fruit fly
161.348	passing in front of a car's headlight.
164.126	OK, now imagine that car
164.126	is 100 trillion miles away,
167.849	and you want to know
167.849	the precise color of that fly.
172.618	So I use computer models
174.399	to calculate the kind of atmosphere
174.399	a planet would need
177.526	to have a suitable climate
177.526	for water and life.
181.439	Here's an artist's concept
181.439	of the planet Kepler-62f,
185.575	with the Earth for reference.
187.507	It's 1,200 light years away,
189.571	and just 40 percent larger than Earth.
192.313	Our NSF-funded work found that it
192.313	could be warm enough for open water
196.385	from many types of atmospheres
196.385	and orientations of its orbit.
200.518	So I'd like future telescopes
200.518	to follow up on this planet
203.675	to look for signs of life.
206.476	Ice on a planet's surface
206.476	is also important for climate.
209.889	Ice absorbs longer,
209.889	redder wavelengths of light,
213.108	and reflects shorter, bluer light.
215.87	That's why the iceberg
215.87	in this photo looks so blue.
219.092	The redder light from the sun
219.092	is absorbed on its way through the ice.
222.613	Only the blue light
222.613	makes it all the way to the bottom.
225.947	Then it gets reflected
225.947	back to up to our eyes
228.363	and we see blue ice.
230.59	My models show that planets
230.59	orbiting cooler stars
233.588	could actually be warmer
233.588	than planets orbiting hotter stars.
236.78	There's another contradiction --
238.343	that ice absorbs the longer
238.343	wavelength light from cooler stars,
242.141	and that light, that energy,
242.141	heats the ice.
246.622	Using climate models to explore
249.006	how these contradictions
249.006	can affect planetary climate
252.135	is vital to the search for life elsewhere.
256.128	And it's no surprise
256.128	that this is my specialty.
259.715	I'm an African-American female astronomer
262.524	and a classically trained actor
264.66	who loves to wear makeup
264.66	and read fashion magazines,
268.519	so I am uniquely positioned to appreciate
268.519	contradictions in nature --
273.376	(Laughter)
274.512	(Applause)
278	... and how they can inform our search
278	for the next planet where life exists.
282.645	My organization, Rising Stargirls,
285.177	teaches astronomy
285.177	to middle-school girls of color,
288.629	using theater, writing and visual art.
292.697	That's another contradiction --
292.697	science and art don't often go together,
296.698	but interweaving them can help
296.698	these girls bring their whole selves
300.524	to what they learn,
301.747	and maybe one day join
301.747	the ranks of astronomers
305.211	who are full of contradictions,
306.989	and use their backgrounds
306.989	to discover, once and for all,
310.163	that we are truly not alone
310.163	in the universe.
314.433	Thank you.
315.608	(Applause)
