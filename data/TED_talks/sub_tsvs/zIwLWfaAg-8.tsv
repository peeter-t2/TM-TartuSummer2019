12.34	Chris Anderson:
12.34	Elon, hey, welcome back to TED.
15.38	It's great to have you here.
16.78	Elon Musk: Thanks for having me.
18.38	CA: So, in the next half hour or so,
21.26	we're going to spend some time
23.1	exploring your vision for what
23.1	an exciting future might look like,
27.02	which I guess makes
27.02	the first question a little ironic:
31.14	Why are you boring?
32.9	EM: Yeah.
34.14	I ask myself that frequently.
39.06	We're trying to dig a hole under LA,
43.22	and this is to create the beginning
46.42	of what will hopefully
46.42	be a 3D network of tunnels
51.34	to alleviate congestion.
53.58	So right now, one of the most
53.58	soul-destroying things is traffic.
59.14	It affects people
59.14	in every part of the world.
62.02	It takes away so much of your life.
65.86	It's horrible.
67.86	It's particularly horrible in LA.
69.5	(Laughter)
72.18	CA: I think you've brought with you
74.14	the first visualization
74.14	that's been shown of this.
76.62	Can I show this?
77.98	EM: Yeah, absolutely.
77.98	So this is the first time --
80.7	Just to show what we're talking about.
82.58	So a couple of key things
82.58	that are important
84.74	in having a 3D tunnel network.
88.66	First of all, you have to be able
90.3	to integrate the entrance
90.3	and exit of the tunnel
92.58	seamlessly into the fabric of the city.
94.66	So by having an elevator,
98.34	sort of a car skate,
98.34	that's on an elevator,
103.14	you can integrate the entrance
103.14	and exits to the tunnel network
107.1	just by using two parking spaces.
110.66	And then the car gets on a skate.
112.78	There's no speed limit here,
114.18	so we're designing this to be able
114.18	to operate at 200 kilometers an hour.
119.22	CA: How much?
120.46	EM: 200 kilometers an hour,
120.46	or about 130 miles per hour.
124.62	So you should be able
124.62	to get from, say, Westwood to LAX
130.86	in six minutes -- five, six minutes.
133.14	(Applause)
137.5	CA: So possibly, initially done,
139.1	it's like on a sort
139.1	of toll road-type basis.
141.42	EM: Yeah.
142.66	CA: Which, I guess,
142.66	alleviates some traffic
144.74	from the surface streets as well.
146.46	EM: So, I don't know
146.46	if people noticed it in the video,
149.1	but there's no real limit
149.1	to how many levels of tunnel you can have.
154.26	You can go much further deep
154.26	than you can go up.
157.1	The deepest mines are much deeper
157.1	than the tallest buildings are tall,
161.3	so you can alleviate any arbitrary
161.3	level of urban congestion
166.58	with a 3D tunnel network.
167.9	This is a very important point.
169.46	So a key rebuttal to the tunnels
169.46	is that if you add one layer of tunnels,
175.86	that will simply alleviate congestion,
175.86	it will get used up,
178.66	and then you'll be back where you started,
178.66	back with congestion.
181.98	But you can go to any
181.98	arbitrary number of tunnels,
184.42	any number of levels.
185.78	CA: But people -- seen traditionally,
185.78	it's incredibly expensive to dig,
189.34	and that would block this idea.
191.14	EM: Yeah.
192.86	Well, they're right.
194.1	To give you an example,
194.1	the LA subway extension,
197.9	which is -- I think it's
197.9	a two-and-a-half mile extension
201.58	that was just completed
201.58	for two billion dollars.
203.843	So it's roughly a billion dollars a mile
203.843	to do the subway extension in LA.
209.26	And this is not the highest
209.26	utility subway in the world.
213.26	So yeah, it's quite difficult
213.26	to dig tunnels normally.
217.78	I think we need to have
217.78	at least a tenfold improvement
220.98	in the cost per mile of tunneling.
223.98	CA: And how could you achieve that?
228.06	EM: Actually, if you just do two things,
230.14	you can get to approximately
230.14	an order of magnitude improvement,
233.5	and I think you can go beyond that.
235.7	So the first thing to do
235.7	is to cut the tunnel diameter
239.98	by a factor of two or more.
241.62	So a single road lane tunnel
241.62	according to regulations
245.62	has to be 26 feet,
245.62	maybe 28 feet in diameter
248.5	to allow for crashes
248.5	and emergency vehicles
251.7	and sufficient ventilation
251.7	for combustion engine cars.
255.98	But if you shrink that diameter
255.98	to what we're attempting,
259.58	which is 12 feet, which is plenty
259.58	to get an electric skate through,
263.26	you drop the diameter by a factor of two
266.5	and the cross-sectional area
266.5	by a factor of four,
270.42	and the tunneling cost scales
270.42	with the cross-sectional area.
273.3	So that's roughly a half-order
273.3	of magnitude improvement right there.
276.54	Then tunneling machines currently tunnel
276.54	for half the time, then they stop,
281.46	and then the rest of the time
281.46	is putting in reinforcements
284.66	for the tunnel wall.
285.98	So if you design the machine instead
288.22	to do continuous
288.22	tunneling and reinforcing,
290.58	that will give you
290.58	a factor of two improvement.
292.82	Combine that and that's a factor of eight.
295.06	Also these machines are far from being
295.06	at their power or thermal limits,
299.74	so you can jack up the power
299.74	to the machine substantially.
302.82	I think you can get
302.82	at least a factor of two,
304.98	maybe a factor of four or five
304.98	improvement on top of that.
309.18	So I think there's a fairly
309.18	straightforward series of steps
313.42	to get somewhere in excess
313.42	of an order of magnitude improvement
316.42	in the cost per mile,
318.18	and our target actually is --
321.14	we've got a pet snail called Gary,
323.98	this is from Gary the snail
323.98	"from ""South Park,"""
326.54	"I mean, sorry, ""SpongeBob SquarePants."""
329.5	(Laughter)
331.1	So Gary is capable of --
335.54	currently he's capable
335.54	of going 14 times faster
339.66	than a tunnel-boring machine.
341.46	(Laughter)
344.26	CA: You want to beat Gary.
346.06	EM: We want to beat Gary.
347.38	(Laughter)
348.94	He's not a patient little fellow,
351.18	and that will be victory.
354.3	Victory is beating the snail.
357.1	CA: But a lot of people imagining,
357.1	dreaming about future cities,
360.18	they imagine that actually
360.18	the solution is flying cars, drones, etc.
364.1	You go aboveground.
366.34	Why isn't that a better solution?
368.18	You save all that tunneling cost.
370.18	EM: Right. I'm in favor of flying things.
372.42	Obviously, I do rockets,
372.42	so I like things that fly.
376.3	This is not some inherent bias
376.3	against flying things,
379.26	but there is a challenge with flying cars
382.34	in that they'll be quite noisy,
385.66	the wind force generated
385.66	will be very high.
391.82	Let's just say that if something's
391.82	flying over your head,
394.54	a whole bunch of flying cars
394.54	going all over the place,
398.26	that is not an anxiety-reducing situation.
402.9	(Laughter)
405.02	You don't think to yourself,
405.02	"""Well, I feel better about today."""
410.34	You're thinking,
410.34	"""Did they service their hubcap,"
412.98	or is it going to come off
412.98	"and guillotine me?"""
415.9	Things like that.
420.14	CA: So you've got this vision
421.74	of future cities with these rich,
421.74	3D networks of tunnels underneath.
427.06	Is there a tie-in here with Hyperloop?
429.1	Could you apply these tunnels
429.1	to use for this Hyperloop idea
432.66	you released a few years ago.
434.66	EM: Yeah, so we've been
434.66	sort of puttering around
437.9	with the Hyperloop stuff for a while.
440.54	We built a Hyperloop test track
440.54	adjacent to SpaceX,
444.38	just for a student competition,
446.54	to encourage innovative
446.54	ideas in transport.
449.58	And it actually ends up being
449.58	the biggest vacuum chamber in the world
454.62	after the Large Hadron Collider,
457.62	by volume.
461.14	So it was quite fun to do that,
461.14	but it was kind of a hobby thing,
466.62	and then we think we might --
470.34	so we've built a little pusher car
470.34	to push the student pods,
476.26	but we're going to try seeing
476.26	how fast we can make the pusher go
480.22	if it's not pushing something.
482.54	So we're cautiously optimistic
484.9	we'll be able to be faster
484.9	than the world's fastest bullet train
489.94	even in a .8-mile stretch.
492.22	CA: Whoa. Good brakes.
494.78	EM: Yeah, I mean, it's -- yeah.
497.06	It's either going to smash
497.06	into tiny pieces or go quite fast.
501.7	CA: But you can picture,
501.7	then, a Hyperloop in a tunnel
505.3	running quite long distances.
507.14	EM: Exactly.
508.86	And looking at tunneling technology,
510.66	it turns out that
510.66	in order to make a tunnel,
513.22	you have to --
516.14	In order to seal against the water table,
518.54	you've got to typically design
518.54	a tunnel wall to be good
523.22	to about five or six atmospheres.
526.979	So to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere,
530.02	or near-vacuum.
531.46	So actually, it sort of turns out
531.46	that automatically,
535.9	if you build a tunnel that is good enough
535.9	to resist the water table,
539.9	it is automatically
539.9	capable of holding vacuum.
542.34	CA: Huh.
543.98	EM: So, yeah.
545.54	CA: And so you could actually picture,
547.42	what kind of length tunnel
547.42	is in Elon's future to running Hyperloop?
553.14	EM: I think there's no real length limit.
556.38	You could dig as much as you want.
559.42	I think if you were to do something
561.66	like a DC-to-New York Hyperloop,
566.86	I think you'd probably want
566.86	to go underground the entire way
569.74	because it's a high-density area.
571.38	You're going under
571.38	a lot of buildings and houses,
575.46	and if you go deep enough,
577.02	you cannot detect the tunnel.
579.42	Sometimes people think,
579.42	well, it's going to be pretty annoying
582.38	to have a tunnel dug under my house.
584.26	Like, if that tunnel is dug
585.62	more than about three or four
585.62	tunnel diameters beneath your house,
588.82	you will not be able
588.82	to detect it being dug at all.
592.7	In fact, if you're able
592.7	to detect the tunnel being dug,
599.42	whatever device you are using,
601.06	you can get a lot of money
601.06	for that device from the Israeli military,
604.35	who is trying to detect
604.35	tunnels from Hamas,
607.456	and from the US Customs and Border patrol
607.456	that try and detect drug tunnels.
612.26	So the reality is
615.5	that earth is incredibly good
615.5	at absorbing vibrations,
619.38	and once the tunnel depth
619.38	is below a certain level,
622.38	it is undetectable.
624.38	Maybe if you have a very sensitive
624.38	seismic instrument,
626.98	you might be able to detect it.
629.1	CA: So you've started
629.1	a new company to do this
631.5	called The Boring Company.
633.22	Very nice. Very funny.
635.18	(Laughter)
636.58	EM: What's funny about that?
638.1	(Laughter)
640.74	CA: How much of your time is this?
643.42	EM: It's maybe ...
647.5	two or three percent.
649.26	CA: You've bought a hobby.
650.58	This is what an Elon Musk
650.58	hobby looks like.
653.34	(Laughter)
654.38	EM: I mean, it really is, like --
656.86	This is basically interns
656.86	and people doing it part time.
663.14	We bought some second-hand machinery.
667.86	It's kind of puttering along,
667.86	but it's making good progress, so --
671.82	CA: So an even bigger part of your time
673.74	is being spent on electrifying
673.74	cars and transport through Tesla.
679.26	Is one of the motivations
679.26	for the tunneling project
681.86	the realization that actually,
684.42	in a world where cars are electric
684.42	and where they're self-driving,
687.86	there may end up being
687.86	more cars on the roads
691.42	on any given hour than there are now?
693.82	EM: Yeah, exactly.
697.86	A lot of people think
697.86	that when you make cars autonomous,
702.18	they'll be able to go faster
702.18	and that will alleviate congestion.
706.82	And to some degree that will be true,
708.74	but once you have shared autonomy
708.74	where it's much cheaper to go by car
713.82	and you can go point to point,
716.78	the affordability of going in a car
716.78	will be better than that of a bus.
721.94	Like, it will cost less than a bus ticket.
724.18	So the amount of driving that will occur
724.18	will be much greater with shared autonomy,
729.26	and actually traffic will get far worse.
732.14	CA: You started Tesla
732.14	with the goal of persuading the world
736.42	that electrification
736.42	was the future of cars,
739.58	and a few years ago,
739.58	people were laughing at you.
741.98	Now, not so much.
744.46	EM: OK.
745.7	(Laughter)
747.66	I don't know. I don't know.
749.9	CA: But isn't it true that pretty much
749.9	every auto manufacturer
753.34	has announced
753.34	serious electrification plans
756.38	for the short- to medium-term future?
759.82	EM: Yeah. Yeah.
763.1	I think almost every automaker
763.1	has some electric vehicle program.
768.1	They vary in seriousness.
769.38	Some are very serious
769.38	about transitioning entirely to electric,
773.7	and some are just dabbling in it.
777.1	And some, amazingly,
777.1	are still pursuing fuel cells,
779.54	but I think that won't last much longer.
781.7	CA: But isn't there a sense, though, Elon,
783.78	where you can now just declare victory
783.78	"and say, you know, ""We did it."""
787.5	Let the world electrify,
787.5	and you go on and focus on other stuff?
793.34	EM: Yeah.
796.14	I intend to stay with Tesla
796.14	as far into the future as I can imagine,
800.74	and there are a lot of exciting
800.74	things that we have coming.
805.42	Obviously the Model 3 is coming soon.
807.62	We'll be unveiling the Tesla Semi truck.
811.94	CA: OK, we're going to come to this.
813.9	So Model 3, it's supposed
813.9	to be coming in July-ish.
818.9	EM: Yeah, it's looking quite good
818.9	for starting production in July.
823.46	CA: Wow.
824.86	One of the things
824.86	that people are so excited about
827.26	is the fact that it's got autopilot.
830.5	And you put out this video a while back
832.86	showing what that technology
832.86	would look like.
838.22	EM: Yeah.
839.46	CA: There's obviously autopilot
839.46	in Model S right now.
841.99	What are we seeing here?
843.38	EM: Yeah, so this is using
843.38	only cameras and GPS.
849.42	So there's no LIDAR
849.42	or radar being used here.
851.94	This is just using passive optical,
851.94	which is essentially what a person uses.
857.02	The whole road system
857.02	is meant to be navigated
859.54	with passive optical, or cameras,
863.62	and so once you solve cameras
866.98	or vision,
869.54	then autonomy is solved.
871.06	If you don't solve vision,
871.06	it's not solved.
873.94	So that's why our focus is
873.94	so heavily on having a vision neural net
879.98	that's very effective for road conditions.
883.22	CA: Right. Many other people
883.22	are going the LIDAR route.
885.86	You want cameras plus radar is most of it.
888.74	EM: You can absolutely
888.74	be superhuman with just cameras.
892.14	Like, you can probably do it
892.14	ten times better than humans would,
895.18	just cameras.
896.46	CA: So the new cars being sold right now
896.46	have eight cameras in them.
900.94	They can't yet do what that showed.
905.3	When will they be able to?
908.26	EM: I think we're still on track
908.26	for being able to go cross-country
914.02	from LA to New York by the end
914.02	of the year, fully autonomous.
918.22	CA: OK, so by the end
918.22	of the year, you're saying,
922.02	someone's going to sit in a Tesla
922.02	without touching the steering wheel,
926.02	"tap in ""New York,"" off it goes."
928.54	EM: Yeah.
929.78	CA: Won't ever have to touch the wheel --
929.78	by the end of 2017.
934.1	EM: Yeah. Essentially,
934.1	November or December of this year,
938.74	we should be able to go all the way
938.74	from a parking lot in California
943.18	to a parking lot in New York,
944.86	no controls touched at any point
944.86	during the entire journey.
948.62	(Applause)
950.66	CA: Amazing.
951.9	But part of that is possible
953.34	because you've already got a fleet
953.34	of Teslas driving all these roads.
956.78	You're accumulating a huge amount
956.78	of data of that national road system.
963.26	EM: Yes, but the thing
963.26	that will be interesting
965.94	is that I'm actually fairly confident
965.94	it will be able to do that route
972.78	even if you change the route dynamically.
976.66	So, it's fairly easy --
979.86	If you say I'm going to be really good
979.86	at one specific route, that's one thing,
983.62	but it should be able to go,
983.62	really be very good,
988.78	certainly once you enter a highway,
990.54	to go anywhere on the highway system
993.34	in a given country.
995.86	So it's not sort of limited
995.86	to LA to New York.
998.18	We could change it
998.18	and make it Seattle-Florida,
1001.66	that day, in real time.
1004.22	So you were going from LA to New York.
1006.38	Now go from LA to Toronto.
1010.14	CA: So leaving aside
1010.14	regulation for a second,
1012.9	in terms of the technology alone,
1015.7	the time when someone
1015.7	will be able to buy one of your cars
1019.54	and literally just take the hands
1019.54	off the wheel and go to sleep
1023.38	and wake up and find that they've arrived,
1025.46	how far away is that, to do that safely?
1027.42	EM: I think that's about two years.
1029.7	So the real trick of it
1029.7	is not how do you make it work
1033.1	say 99.9 percent of the time,
1036.06	because, like, if a car crashes
1036.06	one in a thousand times,
1040.179	then you're probably still not going
1040.179	to be comfortable falling asleep.
1047.34	You shouldn't be, certainly.
1048.9	(Laughter)
1051.86	It's never going to be perfect.
1054.78	No system is going to be perfect,
1056.54	but if you say it's perhaps --
1060.34	the car is unlikely to crash
1062.78	in a hundred lifetimes,
1062.78	or a thousand lifetimes,
1066.26	then people are like, OK, wow,
1066.26	if I were to live a thousand lives,
1070.18	I would still most likely
1070.18	never experience a crash,
1072.82	then that's probably OK.
1074.22	CA: To sleep.
1075.46	I guess the big concern of yours
1075.46	is that people may actually
1078.34	get seduced too early
1078.34	to think that this is safe,
1080.65	and that you'll have some horrible
1080.65	incident happen that puts things back.
1085.22	EM: Well, I think that the autonomy system
1085.22	is likely to at least mitigate the crash,
1091.26	except in rare circumstances.
1094.1	The thing to appreciate
1094.1	about vehicle safety
1096.42	is this is probabilistic.
1100.74	I mean, there's some chance that any time
1100.74	a human driver gets in a car,
1104.22	that they will have an accident
1104.22	that is their fault.
1107.18	It's never zero.
1109.26	So really the key threshold for autonomy
1113.66	is how much better does autonomy
1113.66	need to be than a person
1118.1	before you can rely on it?
1119.5	CA: But once you get
1119.5	literally safe hands-off driving,
1122.94	the power to disrupt
1122.94	the whole industry seems massive,
1125.78	because at that point you've spoken
1125.78	of people being able to buy a car,
1130.18	drops you off at work,
1130.18	and then you let it go
1132.34	and provide a sort of Uber-like
1132.34	service to other people,
1136.34	earn you money,
1137.58	maybe even cover the cost
1137.58	of your lease of that car,
1140.06	so you can kind of get a car for free.
1141.94	Is that really likely?
1143.22	EM: Yeah. Absolutely
1143.22	this is what will happen.
1146.1	So there will be a shared autonomy fleet
1148.1	where you buy your car
1149.38	and you can choose
1149.38	to use that car exclusively,
1152.82	you could choose to have it be used
1152.82	only by friends and family,
1156.54	only by other drivers
1156.54	who are rated five star,
1161.62	you can choose to share it sometimes
1161.62	but not other times.
1167.94	That's 100 percent what will occur.
1171.26	It's just a question of when.
1173.78	CA: Wow.
1175.02	So you mentioned the Semi
1177.26	and I think you're planning
1177.26	to announce this in September,
1180.02	but I'm curious whether there's
1180.02	anything you could show us today?
1183.14	EM: I will show you
1183.14	a teaser shot of the truck.
1187.02	(Laughter)
1189.54	It's alive.
1191.5	CA: OK.
1192.74	EM: That's definitely a case
1192.74	where we want to be cautious
1195.46	about the autonomy features.
1198.18	Yeah.
1199.42	(Laughter)
1201.06	CA: We can't see that much of it,
1202.7	but it doesn't look like
1202.7	just a little friendly neighborhood truck.
1205.94	It looks kind of badass.
1207.22	What sort of semi is this?
1210.98	EM: So this is a heavy duty,
1210.98	long-range semitruck.
1215.58	So it's the highest weight capability
1219.86	and with long range.
1222.94	So essentially it's meant to alleviate
1222.94	the heavy-duty trucking loads.
1229.1	And this is something which
1229.1	people do not today think is possible.
1234.42	They think the truck doesn't have enough
1234.42	power or it doesn't have enough range,
1238.18	and then with the Tesla Semi
1240.74	we want to show that no, an electric truck
1243.42	actually can out-torque any diesel semi.
1249.46	And if you had a tug-of-war competition,
1253.62	the Tesla Semi
1253.62	will tug the diesel semi uphill.
1258.7	(Laughter)
1260.98	(Applause)
1262.86	CA: That's pretty cool.
1262.86	And short term, these aren't driverless.
1265.9	These are going to be trucks
1265.9	that truck drivers want to drive.
1270.3	EM: Yes. So what will be
1270.3	really fun about this
1272.94	is you have a flat torque RPM curve
1272.94	with an electric motor,
1278.34	whereas with a diesel motor or any kind
1278.34	of internal combustion engine car,
1281.86	you've got a torque RPM curve
1281.86	that looks like a hill.
1285.66	So this will be a very spry truck.
1288.62	You can drive this
1288.62	around like a sports car.
1291.5	There's no gears.
1291.5	It's, like, single speed.
1293.9	CA: There's a great movie
1293.9	to be made here somewhere.
1296.38	I don't know what it is
1296.38	and I don't know that it ends well,
1299.18	but it's a great movie.
1300.42	(Laughter)
1301.46	EM: It's quite bizarre test-driving.
1304.22	When I was driving the test prototype
1304.22	for the first truck.
1308.26	It's really weird,
1308.26	because you're driving around
1310.54	and you're just so nimble,
1310.54	and you're in this giant truck.
1313.66	CA: Wait, you've
1313.66	already driven a prototype?
1317.18	EM: Yeah, I drove it
1317.18	around the parking lot,
1319.3	and I was like, this is crazy.
1320.78	CA: Wow. This is no vaporware.
1322.98	EM: It's just like,
1322.98	driving this giant truck
1325.1	and making these mad maneuvers.
1327.1	CA: This is cool.
1327.1	OK, from a really badass picture
1329.58	to a kind of less badass picture.
1332.22	This is just a cute house
1332.22	"from ""Desperate Housewives"" or something."
1335.58	What on earth is going on here?
1338.66	EM: Well, this illustrates
1338.66	the picture of the future
1341.14	that I think is how things will evolve.
1344.14	You've got an electric car
1344.14	in the driveway.
1346.5	If you look in between
1346.5	the electric car and the house,
1350.26	there are actually three Powerwalls
1350.26	stacked up against the side of the house,
1354.14	and then that house roof is a solar roof.
1356.98	So that's an actual solar glass roof.
1359.1	CA: OK.
1360.34	EM: That's a picture of a real --
1360.34	well, admittedly, it's a real fake house.
1364.62	That's a real fake house.
1366.3	(Laughter)
1369.42	CA: So these roof tiles,
1371.3	some of them have in them
1371.3	basically solar power, the ability to --
1377.46	EM: Yeah. Solar glass tiles
1379.18	where you can adjust
1379.18	the texture and the color
1384.3	to a very fine-grained level,
1386.3	and then there's
1386.3	sort of microlouvers in the glass,
1391.9	such that when you're looking
1391.9	at the roof from street level
1395.38	or close to street level,
1397.1	all the tiles look the same
1399.5	whether there is a solar cell
1399.5	behind it or not.
1405.82	So you have an even color
1409.26	from the ground level.
1412.78	If you were to look at it
1412.78	from a helicopter,
1414.9	you would be actually able
1414.9	to look through and see
1417.3	that some of the glass tiles have
1417.3	a solar cell behind them and some do not.
1421.34	You can't tell from street level.
1422.98	CA: You put them in the ones
1422.98	that are likely to see a lot of sun,
1426.06	and that makes these roofs
1426.06	super affordable, right?
1428.46	They're not that much more expensive
1428.46	than just tiling the roof.
1431.46	EM: Yeah.
1433.66	We're very confident
1433.66	that the cost of the roof
1437.66	plus the cost of electricity --
1441.74	A solar glass roof will be less
1441.74	than the cost of a normal roof
1444.7	plus the cost of electricity.
1446.14	So in other words,
1447.42	this will be economically a no-brainer,
1451.78	we think it will look great,
1453.5	and it will last --
1455.66	We thought about having
1455.66	the warranty be infinity,
1458.74	but then people thought,
1459.98	well, that might sound
1459.98	like were just talking rubbish,
1462.58	but actually this is toughened glass.
1468.22	Well after the house has collapsed
1471.14	and there's nothing there,
1473.06	the glass tiles will still be there.
1476.62	(Applause)
1478.22	CA: I mean, this is cool.
1479.98	So you're rolling this out
1479.98	in a couple week's time, I think,
1482.86	with four different roofing types.
1485.42	EM: Yeah, we're starting off
1485.42	with two, two initially,
1487.98	and the second two
1487.98	will be introduced early next year.
1491.18	CA: And what's the scale of ambition here?
1493.26	How many houses do you believe
1493.26	could end up having this type of roofing?
1499.58	EM: I think eventually
1502.38	almost all houses will have a solar roof.
1507.7	The thing is to consider
1507.7	the time scale here
1511.26	to be probably on the order
1513.74	of 40 or 50 years.
1516.94	So on average, a roof
1516.94	is replaced every 20 to 25 years.
1523.22	But you don't start replacing
1523.22	all roofs immediately.
1526.58	But eventually,
1526.58	if you say were to fast-forward
1529.94	to say 15 years from now,
1533.42	it will be unusual to have a roof
1533.42	that does not have solar.
1537.66	CA: Is there a mental model thing
1537.66	that people don't get here
1540.54	that because of the shift in the cost,
1540.54	the economics of solar power,
1544.98	most houses actually have
1544.98	enough sunlight on their roof
1549.1	pretty much to power all of their needs.
1551.18	If you could capture the power,
1553.1	it could pretty much
1553.1	power all their needs.
1555.18	You could go off-grid, kind of.
1556.74	EM: It depends on where you are
1558.3	and what the house size is
1558.3	relative to the roof area,
1561.58	but it's a fair statement to say
1563.46	that most houses in the US
1563.46	have enough roof area
1568.3	to power all the needs of the house.
1571.62	CA: So the key to the economics
1574.82	of the cars, the Semi, of these houses
1578.86	is the falling price
1578.86	of lithium-ion batteries,
1582.78	which you've made a huge bet on as Tesla.
1585.3	In many ways, that's almost
1585.3	the core competency.
1587.58	And you've decided
1589.86	that to really, like, own that competency,
1595.1	you just have to build
1595.1	the world's largest manufacturing plant
1598.58	to double the world's supply
1598.58	of lithium-ion batteries,
1601.74	with this guy. What is this?
1604.06	EM: Yeah, so that's the Gigafactory,
1607.54	progress so far on the Gigafactory.
1610.26	Eventually, you can sort of roughly see
1612.18	that there's sort of
1612.18	a diamond shape overall,
1615.14	and when it's fully done,
1615.14	it'll look like a giant diamond,
1619.78	or that's the idea behind it,
1622.02	and it's aligned on true north.
1623.54	It's a small detail.
1625.3	CA: And capable of producing, eventually,
1629.22	like a hundred gigawatt hours
1629.22	of batteries a year.
1632.42	EM: A hundred gigawatt hours.
1632.42	We think probably more, but yeah.
1635.42	CA: And they're actually
1635.42	being produced right now.
1637.82	EM: They're in production already.
1637.82	CA: You guys put out this video.
1641.02	I mean, is that speeded up?
1642.38	EM: That's the slowed down version.
1644.1	(Laughter)
1645.9	CA: How fast does it actually go?
1648.26	EM: Well, when it's running at full speed,
1651.1	you can't actually see the cells
1651.1	without a strobe light.
1655.06	It's just blur.
1656.36	(Laughter)
1659.82	CA: One of your core ideas, Elon,
1659.82	about what makes an exciting future
1663.42	is a future where we no longer
1663.42	feel guilty about energy.
1667.3	Help us picture this.
1668.74	How many Gigafactories, if you like,
1668.74	does it take to get us there?
1673.78	EM: It's about a hundred, roughly.
1675.54	It's not 10, it's not a thousand.
1677.3	Most likely a hundred.
1679.86	CA: See, I find this amazing.
1681.54	You can picture what it would take
1685.54	to move the world
1685.54	off this vast fossil fuel thing.
1688.82	It's like you're building one,
1691.42	it costs five billion dollars,
1694.3	or whatever, five to 10 billion dollars.
1696.46	Like, it's kind of cool
1696.46	that you can picture that project.
1700.1	And you're planning to do, at Tesla --
1700.1	announce another two this year.
1705.3	EM: I think we'll announce locations
1708.18	for somewhere between two
1708.18	and four Gigafactories later this year.
1711.94	Yeah, probably four.
1713.86	CA: Whoa.
1715.5	(Applause)
1718.14	No more teasing from you for here?
1722.22	Like -- where, continent?
1727.3	You can say no.
1729.26	EM: We need to address a global market.
1733.06	CA: OK.
1734.3	(Laughter)
1735.66	This is cool.
1739.3	I think we should talk for --
1744.38	Actually, double mark it.
1746.02	I'm going to ask you one question
1746.02	about politics, only one.
1750.14	I'm kind of sick of politics,
1750.14	but I do want to ask you this.
1753.42	You're on a body now
1753.42	giving advice to a guy --
1759.78	EM: Who?
1761.02	CA: Who has said he doesn't
1761.02	really believe in climate change,
1763.94	and there's a lot of people out there
1763.94	who think you shouldn't be doing that.
1768.3	They'd like you to walk away from that.
1770.22	What would you say to them?
1772.54	EM: Well, I think that first of all,
1776.18	I'm just on two advisory councils
1778.74	where the format consists
1778.74	of going around the room
1781.58	and asking people's opinion on things,
1784.5	and so there's like a meeting
1784.5	every month or two.
1789.38	That's the sum total of my contribution.
1792.62	But I think to the degree
1792.62	that there are people in the room
1795.42	who are arguing in favor
1795.42	of doing something about climate change,
1800.18	or social issues,
1806.34	I've used the meetings I've had thus far
1809.58	to argue in favor of immigration
1809.58	and in favor of climate change.
1814.46	(Applause)
1816.42	And if I hadn't done that,
1818.54	that wasn't on the agenda before.
1821.38	So maybe nothing will happen,
1821.38	but at least the words were said.
1826.5	CA: OK.
1827.74	(Applause)
1831.62	So let's talk SpaceX and Mars.
1835.18	Last time you were here,
1836.66	you spoke about what seemed like
1836.66	a kind of incredibly ambitious dream
1840.38	to develop rockets
1840.38	that were actually reusable.
1844.7	And you've only gone and done it.
1846.86	EM: Finally. It took a long time.
1848.5	CA: Talk us through this.
1848.5	What are we looking at here?
1851.1	EM: So this is one of our rocket boosters
1853.26	coming back from
1853.26	very high and fast in space.
1857.86	So just delivered the upper stage
1861.14	at high velocity.
1863.26	I think this might have been
1863.26	at sort of Mach 7 or so,
1867.14	delivery of the upper stage.
1870.7	(Applause)
1873.66	CA: So that was a sped-up --
1875.18	EM: That was the slowed down version.
1877.02	(Laughter)
1878.38	CA: I thought that was
1878.38	the sped-up version.
1880.9	But I mean, that's amazing,
1882.26	and several of these failed
1883.62	before you finally
1883.62	figured out how to do it,
1886.58	but now you've done this,
1886.58	what, five or six times?
1889.5	EM: We're at eight or nine.
1891.82	CA: And for the first time,
1893.46	you've actually reflown
1893.46	one of the rockets that landed.
1896.62	EM: Yeah, so we landed the rocket booster
1899.42	and then prepped it for flight again
1899.42	and flew it again,
1902.06	so it's the first reflight
1902.06	of an orbital booster
1907.26	where that reflight is relevant.
1909.26	So it's important to appreciate
1909.26	that reusability is only relevant
1912.46	if it is rapid and complete.
1917.22	So like an aircraft or a car,
1920.5	the reusability is rapid and complete.
1922.9	You do not send your aircraft
1922.9	to Boeing in-between flights.
1927.98	CA: Right. So this is allowing you
1927.98	to dream of this really ambitious idea
1932.82	of sending many, many, many people to Mars
1936.02	in, what, 10 or 20 years time, I guess.
1938.46	EM: Yeah.
1939.86	CA: And you've designed
1939.86	this outrageous rocket to do it.
1943.3	Help us understand
1943.3	the scale of this thing.
1945.74	EM: Well, visually
1945.74	you can see that's a person.
1952.5	Yeah, and that's the vehicle.
1954.34	(Laughter)
1956.02	CA: So if that was a skyscraper,
1957.78	that's like, did I read that,
1957.78	a 40-story skyscraper?
1961.14	EM: Probably a little more, yeah.
1964.18	The thrust level of this is really --
1970.18	This configuration is about four times
1970.18	the thrust of the Saturn V moon rocket.
1976.26	CA: Four times the thrust of the biggest
1976.26	rocket humanity ever created before.
1981.14	EM: Yeah. Yeah.
1984.46	CA: As one does.
1984.46	EM: Yeah.
1985.94	(Laughter)
1988.94	In units of 747, a 747 is only about
1988.94	a quarter of a million pounds of thrust,
1994.94	so for every 10 million pounds of thrust,
1998.06	there's 40 747s.
1999.78	So this would be the thrust equivalent
1999.78	of 120 747s, with all engines blazing.
2006.06	CA: And so even with a machine
2006.06	designed to escape Earth's gravity,
2010.3	I think you told me last time
2011.74	this thing could actually
2011.74	take a fully loaded 747,
2015.02	people, cargo, everything,
2017.38	into orbit.
2018.66	EM: Exactly. This can take
2018.66	a fully loaded 747 with maximum fuel,
2023.82	maximum passengers,
2023.82	maximum cargo on the 747 --
2028.34	this can take it as cargo.
2031.9	CA: So based on this,
2033.66	you presented recently
2033.66	this Interplanetary Transport System
2038.5	which is visualized this way.
2041.9	This is a scene you picture in, what,
2046.7	People walking into this rocket.
2049.3	EM: I'm hopeful it's sort of
2049.3	an eight- to 10-year time frame.
2053.9	Aspirationally, that's our target.
2056.3	Our internal targets
2056.3	are more aggressive, but I think --
2059.34	(Laughter)
2063.42	CA: OK.
2064.66	EM: While vehicle seems quite large
2066.82	and is large by comparison
2066.82	with other rockets,
2069.019	I think the future spacecraft
2073.019	will make this look like a rowboat.
2078.14	The future spaceships
2078.14	will be truly enormous.
2082.86	CA: Why, Elon?
2085.059	Why do we need to build a city on Mars
2089.22	with a million people
2089.22	on it in your lifetime,
2092.3	which I think is kind of
2092.3	what you've said you'd love to do?
2096.3	EM: I think it's important to have
2100.94	a future that is inspiring and appealing.
2103.7	I just think there have to be reasons
2106.499	that you get up in the morning
2106.499	and you want to live.
2109.46	Like, why do you want to live?
2110.94	What's the point? What inspires you?
2112.7	What do you love about the future?
2114.58	And if we're not out there,
2116.1	if the future does not include
2116.1	being out there among the stars
2120.14	and being a multiplanet species,
2121.86	I find that it's incredibly depressing
2124.38	if that's not the future
2124.38	that we're going to have.
2127.74	(Applause)
2131.94	CA: People want to position this
2131.94	as an either or,
2134.3	that there are so many desperate things
2134.3	happening on the planet now
2138.02	from climate to poverty
2138.02	to, you know, you pick your issue.
2142.3	And this feels like a distraction.
2144.86	You shouldn't be thinking about this.
2146.7	You should be solving what's here and now.
2148.9	And to be fair, you've done
2148.9	a fair old bit to actually do that
2151.86	with your work on sustainable energy.
2154.7	But why not just do that?
2159.18	EM: I think there's --
2164.66	I look at the future
2164.66	from the standpoint of probabilities.
2169.1	It's like a branching
2169.1	stream of probabilities,
2173.3	and there are actions that we can take
2173.3	that affect those probabilities
2179.74	or that accelerate one thing
2179.74	or slow down another thing.
2183.82	I may introduce something new
2183.82	to the probability stream.
2190.66	Sustainable energy
2190.66	will happen no matter what.
2192.86	If there was no Tesla,
2192.86	if Tesla never existed,
2195.38	it would have to happen out of necessity.
2198.26	It's tautological.
2199.86	If you don't have sustainable energy,
2199.86	it means you have unsustainable energy.
2203.54	Eventually you will run out,
2205.18	and the laws of economics
2205.18	will drive civilization
2211.02	towards sustainable energy,
2212.7	inevitably.
2213.94	The fundamental value
2213.94	of a company like Tesla
2216.94	is the degree to which it accelerates
2216.94	the advent of sustainable energy,
2221.38	faster than it would otherwise occur.
2224.94	So when I think, like,
2226.18	what is the fundamental good
2226.18	of a company like Tesla,
2228.94	I would say, hopefully,
2230.66	if it accelerated that by a decade,
2230.66	potentially more than a decade,
2236.3	that would be quite a good thing to occur.
2238.46	That's what I consider to be
2240.1	the fundamental
2240.1	aspirational good of Tesla.
2245.3	Then there's becoming a multiplanet
2245.3	species and space-faring civilization.
2251.66	This is not inevitable.
2253.62	It's very important to appreciate
2253.62	this is not inevitable.
2256.34	The sustainable energy future
2256.34	I think is largely inevitable,
2259.46	but being a space-faring civilization
2259.46	is definitely not inevitable.
2264.22	If you look at the progress in space,
2268.42	in 1969 you were able
2268.42	to send somebody to the moon.
2274.66	Then we had the Space Shuttle.
2277.58	The Space Shuttle could only
2277.58	take people to low Earth orbit.
2281.02	Then the Space Shuttle retired,
2282.58	and the United States
2282.58	could take no one to orbit.
2286.14	So that's the trend.
2287.42	The trend is like down to nothing.
2291.38	People are mistaken when they think
2293.78	that technology
2293.78	just automatically improves.
2295.9	It does not automatically improve.
2297.82	It only improves if a lot of people
2297.82	work very hard to make it better,
2302.5	and actually it will, I think,
2302.5	by itself degrade, actually.
2308.3	You look at great civilizations
2308.3	like Ancient Egypt,
2310.74	and they were able to make the pyramids,
2312.7	and they forgot how to do that.
2314.54	And then the Romans,
2314.54	they built these incredible aqueducts.
2317.38	They forgot how to do it.
2320.54	CA: Elon, it almost seems,
2320.54	listening to you
2322.62	and looking at the different
2322.62	things you've done,
2324.9	that you've got this unique
2324.9	double motivation on everything
2327.7	that I find so interesting.
2331.54	One is this desire to work
2331.54	for humanity's long-term good.
2336.14	The other is the desire
2336.14	to do something exciting.
2338.5	And often it feels like you feel
2338.5	like you need the one to drive the other.
2343.22	With Tesla, you want
2343.22	to have sustainable energy,
2346.34	so you made these super sexy,
2346.34	exciting cars to do it.
2350.9	Solar energy, we need to get there,
2352.62	so we need to make these beautiful roofs.
2354.597	We haven't even spoken
2354.597	about your newest thing,
2356.82	which we don't have time to do,
2358.38	but you want to save humanity from bad AI,
2360.74	and so you're going to create
2360.74	this really cool brain-machine interface
2364.06	to give us all infinite memory
2364.06	and telepathy and so forth.
2367.94	And on Mars, it feels
2367.94	like what you're saying is,
2370.66	yeah, we need to save humanity
2374.38	and have a backup plan,
2375.78	but also we need to inspire humanity,
2379.06	and this is a way to inspire.
2385.5	EM: I think the value
2385.5	of beauty and inspiration
2389.3	is very much underrated,
2391.3	no question.
2392.9	But I want to be clear.
2394.18	I'm not trying to be anyone's savior.
2396.02	That is not the --
2398.06	I'm just trying to think about the future
2401.86	and not be sad.
2404.22	(Applause)
2406.34	CA: Beautiful statement.
2410.02	I think everyone here would agree
2411.62	that it is not --
2413.62	None of this is going
2413.62	to happen inevitably.
2415.7	The fact that in your mind,
2415.7	you dream this stuff,
2419.38	you dream stuff that no one else
2419.38	would dare dream,
2421.98	or no one else
2421.98	would be capable of dreaming
2424.66	at the level of complexity that you do.
2428.34	The fact that you do that, Elon Musk,
2428.34	is a really remarkable thing.
2431.54	Thank you for helping us all
2431.54	to dream a bit bigger.
2434.26	EM: But you'll tell me if it ever
2434.26	starts getting genuinely insane, right?
2437.78	(Laughter)
2440.3	CA: Thank you, Elon Musk.
2440.3	That was really, really fantastic.
2443.42	That was really fantastic.
2444.86	(Applause)
