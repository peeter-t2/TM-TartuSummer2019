25.23	I can't help but this wish:
26.583	to think about when you're a little kid,
26.583	and all your friends ask you,
31.04	"""If a genie could give you"
31.04	one wish in the world,
33.652	"what would it be?"""
35.183	And I always answered,
36.596	"""Well, I'd want the wish"
37.93	to have the wisdom to know
37.93	"exactly what to wish for."""
41.772	Well, then you'd be screwed,
43.147	because you'd know what to wish for,
43.147	and you'd use up your wish,
46.186	and now, since we only have one wish --
46.186	unlike last year they had three wishes --
50.033	I'm not going to wish for that.
51.543	So let's get to what I would like,
51.543	which is world peace.
56.57	And I know what you're thinking:
58.626	"You're thinking, ""The poor girl up there,"
60.614	she thinks she's at a beauty pageant.
62.415	"She's not. She's at the TED Prize."""
64.69	(Laughter)
67.824	But I really do think it makes sense.
70.244	And I think that
70.244	the first step to world peace
72.863	is for people to meet each other.
74.707	I've met a lot of different
74.707	people over the years,
77.219	and I've filmed some of them,
78.645	from a dotcom executive in New York
78.645	who wanted to take over the world,
83.565	to a military press officer in Qatar,
86	who would rather not take over the world.
88.529	If you've seen the film
88.529	"""Control Room"" that was sent out,"
91.238	you'd understand a little bit why.
92.887	(Applause)
94.062	Thank you.
95.244	Wow! Some of you watched it.
95.244	That's great. That's great.
98.54	So basically what I'd like
98.54	to talk about today
103.134	is a way for people to travel,
106	to meet people in a different way than --
110	because you can't travel
110	all over the world at the same time.
113	And a long time ago --
113	well, about 40 years ago --
118.26	my mom had an exchange student.
121.897	And I'm going to show you
121.897	slides of the exchange student.
124.739	This is Donna.
125.914	This is Donna at the Statue of Liberty.
129.446	This is my mother and aunt
129.446	teaching Donna how to ride a bike.
133.538	This is Donna eating ice cream.
136.284	And this is Donna teaching my aunt
136.284	how to do a Filipino dance.
142.882	I really think as the world
142.882	is getting smaller,
145.123	it becomes more and more important
146.79	that we learn each other's dance moves,
148.676	that we meet each other,
148.676	we get to know each other,
151.106	we are able to figure out
151.106	a way to cross borders,
154.769	to understand each other, to understand
154.769	people's hopes and dreams,
157.917	what makes them laugh and cry.
159.397	And I know that we can't
159.397	all do exchange programs,
162.442	and I can't force everybody to travel;
164.291	I've already talked about that
164.291	to Chris and Amy,
166.634	and they said that
166.634	there's a problem with this:
168.86	You can't force people, free will.
170.619	And I totally support that,
170.619	so we're not forcing people to travel.
173.75	But I'd like to talk
173.75	about another way to travel
176.028	that doesn't require
176.028	a ship or an airplane,
179	and just requires a movie camera,
179	a projector and a screen.
184	And that's what I'm going
184	to talk to you about today.
188.857	I was asked that I speak a little bit
188.857	about where I personally come from,
193.612	and Cameron, I don't know how
193.612	you managed to get out of that one,
196.739	but I think that building bridges
196.739	is important to me
201	because of where I come from.
203.171	I'm the daughter of an American mother
206.574	and an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian father.
209.709	So I'm the living product
209.709	of two cultures coming together.
213.805	No pun intended.
214.981	(Laughter)
216.012	And I've also been called,
217.293	as an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian American
217.293	with a Persian name,
220.166	"the ""Middle East Peace Crisis."""
222.08	So maybe me starting to take
222.08	pictures was some kind of way
226.58	to bring both sides
226.58	of my family together --
230.056	a way to take the worlds with me,
230.056	a way to tell stories visually.
235.453	It all kind of started that way,
237.073	but I think that I really realized
237.073	the power of the image
240.693	when I first went
240.693	to the garbage-collecting village
243.929	in Egypt, when I was about 16.
246.326	My mother took me there.
248.905	She's somebody who believes strongly
248.905	in community service,
251.688	and decided that this was something
251.688	that I needed to do.
254.355	And so I went there and I met
254.355	some amazing women there.
258	There was a center there,
260.954	where they were teaching
260.954	people how to read and write,
264.016	and get vaccinations
264.016	against the many diseases
266.254	you can get from sorting through garbage.
268.373	And I began teaching there.
269.962	I taught English, and I met
269.962	some incredible women there.
273	I met people that live
273	seven people to a room,
277.812	barely can afford their evening meal,
280.168	yet lived with this strength
280.168	of spirit and sense of humor
283.715	and just incredible qualities.
286.421	I got drawn into this community
286.421	and I began to take pictures there.
290.199	I took pictures of weddings
290.199	and older family members --
297	things that they wanted memories of.
300.141	About two years after I started
300.141	taking these pictures,
303.57	the UN Conference
303.57	on Population and Development
308	asked me to show them at the conference.
310.92	So I was 18; I was very excited.
313.892	It was my first exhibit of photographs
313.892	and they were all put up there,
319.273	and after about two days,
319.273	they all came down except for three.
325.789	People were very upset,
327.663	very angry that I was showing
327.663	these dirty sides of Cairo,
331.297	and why didn't I cut
331.297	the dead donkey out of the frame?
334.778	And as I sat there, I got very depressed.
337.039	I looked at this big empty wall
337.039	with three lonely photographs
342.661	that were, you know,
342.661	very pretty photographs
346.939	"and I was like, ""I failed at this."""
349.854	But I was looking at this intense
349.854	emotion and intense feeling
355.001	that had come out of people
355.001	just seeing these photographs.
358.478	Here I was, this 18-year-old pipsqueak
358.478	that nobody listened to,
361.483	and all of a sudden,
361.483	I put these photographs on the wall,
364.285	and there were arguments,
364.285	and they had to be taken down.
366.941	And I saw the power of the image,
366.941	and it was incredible.
370.313	And I think the most important reaction
370.313	that I saw there was actually from people
374.171	that would never have gone
374.171	to the garbage village themselves,
377.07	that would never have seen
377.07	that the human spirit could thrive
379.959	in such difficult circumstances.
382.067	And I think it was at that point
383.623	that I decided I wanted to use
383.623	photography and film
387.909	to somehow bridge gaps,
387.909	to bridge cultures,
390.375	bring people together, cross borders.
395.713	And so that's what really
395.713	kind of started me off.
399.373	Did a stint at MTV, made a film
399.373	"called ""Startup.com,"""
402.702	and I've done a couple of music films.
407	But in 2003, when the war
407	in Iraq was about to start,
414.465	it was a very surreal feeling for me,
416.701	because before the war started,
418.601	there was kind of this media war
418.601	that was going on.
421.037	And I was watching television in New York,
423.077	and there seemed to be just one
423.077	point of view that was coming across,
426.738	and the coverage went
426.738	from the US State Department
431.589	to embedded troops.
434.087	And what was coming across on the news
436.731	was that there was going to be this
436.731	clean war and precision bombings,
441	and the Iraqis would be greeting
441	the Americans as liberators,
444.798	and throwing flowers at their feet
444.798	in the streets of Baghdad.
448.098	And I knew that there
448.098	was a completely other story
450.995	that was taking place in the Middle East,
450.995	where my parents were.
454.037	I knew that there was
454.037	a completely other story being told,
457.126	"and I was thinking, ""How are people"
457.126	supposed to communicate with each other
460.682	when they're getting completely
460.682	different messages,
463.099	and nobody knows
463.099	what the other's being told?
465.23	How are people supposed to have
465.23	any kind of common understanding
468.271	or know how to move together
468.271	into the future?
470.93	So I knew that I had to go there.
473.202	I just wanted to be in the center.
475.266	I had no plan. I had no funding.
477.791	I didn't even have a camera at the time --
477.791	I had somebody bring it there,
482	because I wanted
482	to get access to Al Jazeera,
485	George Bush's favorite channel,
487	and a place which I was very curious
487	about because it's disliked
492.265	by many governments across the Arab world,
494.78	and also called the mouthpiece
494.78	of Osama Bin Laden
498.406	by some people in the US government.
500.611	So I was thinking, this station
500.611	that's hated by so many people
504.909	has to be doing something right.
506.466	I've got to go see what this is all about.
509.999	And I also wanted to go see
509.999	Central Command,
512.12	which was 10 minutes away.
513.688	And that way, I could get access
513.688	to how this news was being created --
519	on the Arab side, reaching the Arab world,
521.232	and on the US and Western side,
521.232	reaching the US.
524.015	And when I went there and sat there,
525.78	and met these people
525.78	that were in the center of it,
528.861	and sat with these characters,
532.491	I met some surprising,
532.491	very complex people.
536.792	And I'd like to share with you
536.792	a little bit of that experience
541	of when you sit with somebody
542.498	and you film them, and you listen to them,
544.546	and you allow them more
544.546	than a five-second sound bite.
548.314	The amazing complexity of people emerges.
556.701	Samir Khader: Business as usual.
559	Iraq, and then Iraq, and then Iraq.
565.897	But between us, if I'm offered
565.897	a job with Fox, I'll take it.
575.977	To change the Arab nightmare
575.977	into the American dream.
585.979	I still have that dream.
588.229	Maybe I will never be able to do it,
591	but I have plans for my children.
595.524	When they finish high school,
596.938	I will send them to America
596.938	to study there.
598.978	I will pay for their study.
601.641	And they will stay there.
610.175	Josh Rushing: The night they showed
610.175	the POWs and the dead soldiers --
614.052	Al Jazeera showed them --
615.292	it was powerful, because America
615.292	doesn't show those kinds of images.
618.52	Most of the news in America
618.52	won't show really gory images
621.229	and this showed American soldiers
621.229	in uniform, strewn about a floor,
624.428	a cold tile floor.
625.627	And it was revolting.
628.387	It was absolutely revolting.
629.897	It made me sick at my stomach.
631.373	And then what hit me was,
631.373	the night before,
634.723	there had been some kind
634.723	of bombing in Basra,
638.342	and Al Jazeera had shown
638.342	images of the people.
643.182	And they were equally, if not more,
643.182	horrifying -- the images were.
647.4	And I remember having seen it
647.4	in the Al Jazeera office,
650.039	"and thought to myself, ""Wow, that's gross."
653.252	"That's bad."""
655.067	And then going away, and probably
655.067	eating dinner or something.
658.001	And it didn't affect me as much.
659.628	So, the impact that had on me --
662.475	me realizing that I just saw
662.475	people on the other side,
666.157	and those people in the Al Jazeera office
668.993	must have felt the way
668.993	I was feeling that night,
671.304	and it upset me on a profound level
674.447	that I wasn't as bothered
674.447	as much the night before.
678.65	It makes me hate war.
680.65	But it doesn't make me believe
680.65	that we're in a world
683.252	that can live without war yet.
684.787	Jehane Noujaim: I was overwhelmed
684.787	by the response of the film.
687.904	We didn't know whether
687.904	it would be able to get out there.
690.611	We had no funding for it.
691.851	We were incredibly lucky
691.851	that it got picked up.
696.053	And when we showed the film
698.558	in both the United States
698.558	and the Arab world,
701.258	we had such incredible reactions.
703.399	It was amazing to see how people
703.399	were moved by this film.
706.431	In the Arab world --
708.618	and it's not really by the film,
708.618	it's by the characters --
711.479	I mean, Josh Rushing was
711.479	this incredibly complex person
715.534	who was thinking about things.
717.085	And when I showed the film
717.085	in the Middle East,
719.378	people wanted to meet Josh.
722	He kind of redefined us
722	as an American population.
725.894	People started to ask me,
725.894	"""Where is this guy now?"""
730	Al Jazeera offered him a job.
732.023	(Laughter)
734	And Samir, on the other hand,
736.274	was also quite an interesting character
736.274	for the Arab world to see,
739.632	because it brought out the complexities
739.632	of this love-hate relationship
743.313	that the Arab world has with the West.
746.257	In the United States, I was blown away
746.257	by the motivations,
751.472	the positive motivations
751.472	of the American people
754.32	when they'd see this film.
756.414	You know, we're criticized abroad
758.033	for believing we're the saviors
758.033	of the world in some way,
761.548	but the flip side of it is that, actually,
764.891	when people do see
764.891	what is happening abroad
767.249	and people's reactions
767.249	to some of our policy abroad,
770	we feel this power, that we need to --
772.294	we feel like we have to get
772.294	the power to change things.
774.913	And I saw this with audiences.
776.492	This woman came up to me
776.492	after the screening and said,
780.272	"""You know, I know this is crazy."
781.889	I saw the bombs being loaded
781.889	on the planes,
783.936	I saw the military going out to war,
785.699	but you don't understand
785.699	people's anger towards us
788.085	until you see the people in the hospitals
788.085	and the victims of the war,
792.272	and how do we get out of this bubble?
794.241	How do we understand what
794.241	"the other person is thinking?"""
799	Now, I don't know whether
799	a film can change the world.
803.095	But I know the power of it,
805.596	I know that it starts people thinking
805.596	about how to change the world.
809.613	Now, I'm not a philosopher,
811.327	so I feel like I shouldn't
811.327	go into great depth on this,
814.209	but let film speak for itself
814.209	and take you to this other world.
818	Because I believe that film has
818	the ability to take you across borders,
822.124	I'd like you to just sit back
822.124	and experience for a couple of minutes
826.166	being taken into another world.
828	And these couple clips take you inside
828	of two of the most difficult conflicts
833.731	that we're faced with today.
836.578	[The last 48 hours of two
836.578	Palestinian suicide bombers.]
841.52	[Paradise Now]

844.927	someone must make a sacrifice!]
848.15	[Woman: That's no
848.15	sacrifice, that's revenge!]
851.657	[If you kill, there's no difference
851.657	between victim and occupier.]
856.763	[Man: If we had airplanes, we wouldn't
856.763	need martyrs, that's the difference.]
862.554	[Woman: The difference is that the Israeli
862.554	military is still stronger.]
867.788	[Man: Then let us be equal in death.]
870	[We still have Paradise.]
872.105	[Woman: There is no Paradise!
872.105	It only exists in your head!]
875.051	[Man: God forbid!]
877.798	[May God forgive you.]
880	[If you were not Abu Azzam's daughter ...]
884.932	[Anyway, I'd rather have Paradise
884.932	in my head than live in this hell!]
888.215	[In this life, we're dead anyway.]
891.65	[One only chooses bitterness
891.65	when the alternative is even bitterer.]
897.999	[Woman: And what about us?
897.999	The ones who remain?]
900.518	[Will we win that way?]
904.28	[Don't you see what you're
904.28	doing is destroying us?]
908.789	[And that you give Israel
908.789	an alibi to carry on?]
912.946	[Man: So with no alibi, Israel will stop?]
915.361	[Woman: Perhaps. We have
915.361	to turn it into a moral war.]
919.593	[Man: How, if Israel has no morals?]
922.89	[Woman: Be careful!]
926.44	[And the real people building
926.44	peace through non-violence]

944.487	"bombing in Tel Aviv.""]"
947.915	[Ayelet: What do you know
947.915	about the casualties?]
950.451	[Tzvika off-screen:

954.595	haven't heard from the other three.]

1035.963	it was a strange idea.]
1041.246	[But after thinking logically about it, ]
1043.688	[I didn't find any reason
1043.688	why not to meet them]
1049.32	[and let them know of our suffering.]
1054.774	[Tzvika: There were
1054.774	many things that touched me.]
1058.242	[We see that there are Palestinians
1058.242	who suffered a lot, who lost children,]
1063.381	[and still believe in the peace

1067	[If we who lost what is most precious
1067	can talk to each other,]

1089	(Video) Man: Song is something
1089	that we communicated with people
1092.492	who otherwise would not have
1092.492	understood where we're coming from.
1097.071	You could give them
1097.071	a long political speech,
1099.738	they would still not understand.
1102.038	But I tell you, when you finish that song,
1104.761	"people will be like, ""Damn, I know"
1104.761	where you niggas are coming from.
1108.766	I know where you guys are coming from.
1110.837	"Death unto apartheid!"""
1112.989	Narrator: It's about
1112.989	the liberation struggle.
1116.362	It's about those children
1116.362	who took to the streets --
1119.833	fighting, screaming,
1119.833	"""Free Nelson Mandela!"""
1124.477	It's about those unions
1124.477	who put down their tools
1129.376	and demanded freedom.
1132.022	Yes. Yes!
1134.681	(Music and singing)
1139.547	(Singing) Freedom!
1142.589	(Applause)
1146.372	Jehane Noujaim: I think everybody's
1146.372	had that feeling of sitting in a theater,
1150.038	in a dark room, with other strangers,
1150.038	watching a very powerful film,
1154.308	and they felt that feeling
1154.308	of transformation.
1157.34	And what I'd like to talk about is
1160.316	how can we use that feeling
1163	to actually create
1163	a movement through film?
1167.837	I've been listening to the talks
1167.837	in the conference,
1172.382	and Robert Wright said yesterday
1174.461	that if we have an appreciation
1174.461	for another person's humanity,
1178.053	then they will have
1178.053	an appreciation for ours.
1180.609	And that's what this is about.
1182.431	It's about connecting people through film,
1185	getting these independent
1185	voices out there.
1188.4	Now, Josh Rushing actually
1188.4	ended up leaving the military
1193.208	and taking a job with Al Jazeera.
1195.279	(Laughter)
1196.596	So his feeling is that
1196.596	he's at Al Jazeera International
1200.207	because he feels like
1200.207	he can actually use media
1203	to bridge the gap between East and West.
1206.415	And that's an amazing thing.
1208.408	But I've been trying to think about ways
1211.264	to give power to these independent voices,
1213.948	to give power to the filmmakers,
1215.565	to give power to people who are trying
1215.565	to use film for change.
1220	And there are incredible organizations
1221.873	that are out there doing this already.
1224	There's Witness,
1224	that you heard from earlier.
1227	There's Just Vision, that are working
1227	with Palestinians and Israelis
1230.594	who are working together for peace,
1230.594	and documenting that process
1233.95	and getting interviews
1233.95	out there and using this film
1236.75	to take to Congress to show
1236.75	that it's a powerful tool,
1239.722	to show that this is a woman who's had
1239.722	her daughter killed in an attack,
1244.285	and she believes that there
1244.285	are peaceful ways to solve this.
1247.435	There's Working Films
1247.435	and there's Current TV,
1251.269	which is an incredible platform
1251.269	for people around the world
1254.6	to be able to put their --
1255.872	(Applause)
1256.9	Yeah, it's amazing.
1258.075	I've watched it and I'm blown away by it
1261.526	and its potential to bring voices
1261.526	from around the world --
1264.834	independent voices
1264.834	from around the world --
1266.866	and create a truly democratic,
1266.866	global television.
1270.326	So what can we do to create
1270.326	a platform for these organizations,
1274.101	to create some momentum,
1276	to get everybody in the world
1276	involved in this movement?
1281.494	I'd like for us to imagine for a second.
1286.198	Imagine a day when you have everyone
1286.198	coming together from around the world.
1293.8	You have towns and villages
1293.8	and theaters --
1300.732	all from around the world,
1303.31	getting together, and sitting in the dark,
1306.073	and sharing a communal
1306.073	experience of watching a film,
1310.597	or a couple of films, together.
1314	Watching a film which maybe highlights
1314	a character that is fighting to live,
1319.506	or just a character
1319.506	that defies stereotypes,
1322.704	makes a joke, sings a song.
1324.797	Comedies, documentaries, shorts.
1327.1	This amazing power
1327.1	can be used to change people
1329.803	and to bond people together;
1329.803	to cross borders,
1332.651	and have people feel like
1332.651	they're having a communal experience.
1336.19	So if you imagine this day
1336.19	when all around the world,
1339.16	you have theaters and places
1339.16	where we project films.
1344.703	If you imagine projecting
1344.703	from Times Square
1348.322	to Tahrir Square in Cairo,
1351.124	the same film in Ramallah,
1351.124	the same film in Jerusalem.
1354.824	You know, we've been talking
1354.824	to a friend of mine
1358.148	about using the side of the Great Pyramid
1360.846	and the Great Wall of China.
1365.175	It's endless what you can imagine,
1368	in terms of where you can project films
1370.136	and where you can have
1370.136	this communal experience.
1372.884	And I believe that this one day,
1372.884	if we can create it,
1376	this one day can create momentum
1376	for all of these independent voices.
1380.375	There isn't an organization
1380.375	which is connecting the independent voices
1385.428	of the world to get out there,
1387	and yet I'm hearing
1387	throughout this conference
1389.204	that the biggest challenge in our future
1391.258	is understanding the other,
1392.894	and having mutual respect
1392.894	for the other and crossing borders.
1396.851	And if film can do that,
1398.748	and if we can get all of these
1398.748	different locations in the world
1401.95	to watch these films together --
1404.578	this could be an incredible day.
1407.226	So we've already made a partnership,
1410.564	set up through somebody
1410.564	from the TED community,
1414.477	John Camen, who introduced me
1414.477	to Steven Apkon,
1417.371	from the Jacob Burns Film Center.
1420	And we started calling up everybody.
1421.914	And in the last week,
1423.297	there have been so many people
1423.297	that have responded to us,
1427	from as close as Palo Alto,
1427	to Mongolia and to India.
1432	There are people that want to be
1432	a part of this global day of film;
1436.58	to be able to provide a platform
1436.58	for independent voices
1440	and independent films to get out there.
1444.183	Now, we've thought
1444.183	about a name for this day,
1447.87	and I'd like to share this with you.
1450.353	Now, the most amazing part
1450.353	of this whole process
1452.638	has been sharing ideas and wishes,
1455.99	and so I invite you
1455.99	to give brainstorms onto
1459	how does this day echo into the future?
1462.545	How do we use technology to make
1462.545	this day echo into the future,
1467.3	so that we can build community
1469	and have these communities working
1469	together, through the Internet?
1474.151	There was a time, many, many years ago,
1476.714	when all of the continents
1476.714	were stuck together.
1479.925	And we call that landmass Pangea.
1482.894	So what we'd like to call this day of film
1482.894	is Pangea Cinema Day.
1488.614	And if you just imagine
1490.137	that all of these people
1490.137	in these towns would be watching,
1493.644	then I think that we can
1493.644	actually really make a movement
1497.657	towards people understanding
1497.657	each other better.
1500	I know that it's very intangible,
1500	touching people's hearts and souls,
1503.843	but the only way that I know how to do it,
1505.9	the only way that I know how to reach out
1505.9	to somebody's heart and soul
1510.509	all across the world,
1510.509	is by showing them a film.
1513.04	And I know that there are independent
1513.04	filmmakers and films out there
1516.425	that can really make this happen.
1519.072	And that's my wish.
1521.154	I guess I'm supposed to give you
1521.154	my one-sentence wish,
1525.625	but we're way out of time.
1528	Chris Anderson:
1528	That is an incredible wish.
1530.344	Pangea Cinema: The day
1530.344	the world comes together.
1533	JN: It's more tangible than world peace,
1533	and it's certainly more immediate.
1536.742	But it would be the day that the world
1536.742	comes together through film,
1542.484	the power of film.
1543.659	CA: Ladies and gentlemen, Jehane Noujaim.
