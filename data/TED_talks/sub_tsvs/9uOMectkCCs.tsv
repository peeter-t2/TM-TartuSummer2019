13.136	In the great 1980s movie 
13.136	"""The Blues Brothers,"""
16.389	there's a scene where John Belushi
16.389	goes to visit Dan Aykroyd in his apartment
21.183	in Chicago for the very first time.
24.106	It's a cramped, tiny space
26.637	and it's just three feet away
26.637	from the train tracks.
30.628	As John sits on Dan's bed,
32.466	a train goes rushing by,
34.929	rattling everything in the room.
37.153	"John asks, ""How often does"
37.153	"that train go by?"""
40.982	"Dan replies, ""So often, you won't"
40.982	"even notice it."""
45.542	And then, something falls off the wall.
49.248	We all know what he's talking about.
51.042	As human beings, we get used
51.042	to everyday things
53.883	really fast.
55.6	As a product designer,
55.6	it's my job to see those everyday things,
58.984	to feel them, and try
58.984	to improve upon them.
63.365	For example, see this piece of fruit?
68.211	See this little sticker?
71.211	That sticker wasn't there
71.211	when I was a kid.
74.776	But somewhere as the years passed,
76.694	someone had the bright idea
76.694	to put that sticker on the fruit.
79.575	Why?
80.292	So it could be easier for us 
81.821	to check out 
81.821	at the grocery counter.
83.558	Well that's great,
84.651	we can get in and out of
84.651	the store quickly.
86.706	But now, there's a new problem.
89.414	When we get home and we're hungry
91.443	and we see this ripe, juicy piece
91.443	of fruit on the counter,
94.874	we just want to pick it up
94.874	and eat it.
97.719	Except now, we have to look
97.719	for this little sticker.
102.587	And dig at it with our nails,
102.587	damaging the flesh.
106.962	Then rolling up that sticker --
108.601	you know what I mean.
109.636	And then trying to flick
109.636	it off your fingers.
111.775	(Applause)
116.276	It's not fun,
117.776	not at all.
119.777	But something interesting happened.
121.992	See the first time you did it,
121.992	you probably felt those feelings.
125.075	You just wanted to eat the piece of fruit.
127.28	You felt upset.
128.287	You just wanted to dive in.
130.541	By the 10th time,
132.165	you started to become less upset
134.641	and you just started peeling
134.641	the label off.
138.071	By the 100th time,
138.071	at least for me,
140.48	I became numb to it.
142.212	I simply picked up the piece of fruit,
145.103	dug at it with my nails,
145.103	tried to flick it off,
149.215	and then wondered,
150.771	"""Was there another sticker?"""
155.68	So why is that?
156.974	Why do we get used to everyday things?
159.126	Well as human beings,
159.126	we have limited brain power.
162.274	And so our brains encode the 
162.274	everyday things we do into habits
167.043	so we can free up space 
167.043	to learn new things.
170.62	It's a process called habituation
172.662	and it's one of the most basic ways,
172.662	as humans, we learn.
177.596	Now, habituation isn't always bad.
180.975	Remember learning to drive?
183.101	I sure do.
184.939	Your hands clenched at 10 and 2
184.939	on the wheel,
188.227	looking at every single
188.227	object out there --
190.445	the cars, the lights, the pedestrians.
193.695	It's a nerve-wracking experience.
196.936	So much so, that I couldn't even
196.936	talk to anyone else in the car
200.52	and I couldn't even listen to music.
202.84	But then something interesting happened.
204.949	As the weeks went by,
204.949	driving became easier and easier.
210.339	You habituated it.
212.647	It started to become 
212.647	fun and second nature.
215.324	And then, you could talk 
215.324	to your friends again
217.531	and listen to music.
218.49	So there's a good reason why
218.49	our brains habituate things.
221.189	If we didn't, we'd notice
221.189	every little detail,
224.552	all the time.
226.717	It would be exhausting,
228.295	and we'd have no time
228.295	to learn about new things.
232.317	But sometimes,
232.317	habituation isn't good.
236.477	If it stops us from noticing 
236.477	the problems that are around us,
239.812	well, that's bad.
241.413	And if it stops us from noticing 
241.413	and fixing those problems,
244.816	well, then that's really bad.
247.923	Comedians know all about this.
249.906	Jerry Seinfeld's entire career was built
249.906	on noticing those little details,
254.791	those idiotic things we do every day
254.791	that we don't even remember.
260.238	He tells us about the time 
260.238	he visited his friends
262.615	and he just wanted to take 
262.615	a comfortable shower.
265.001	He'd reach out and grab the handle
265.001	and turn it slightly one way,
268.9	and it was 100 degrees too hot.
271.483	And then he'd turn it the other way,
271.483	and it was 100 degrees too cold.
275.415	He just wanted a comfortable shower.
277.778	Now, we've all been there,
279.941	we just don't remember it.
281.726	But Jerry did,
283.048	and that's a comedian's job.
285.062	But designers, innovators 
285.062	and entrepreneurs,
288.182	it's our job to not just notice
288.182	those things,
290.589	but to go one step further
290.589	and try to fix them.
295.276	See this, this person,
296.842	this is Mary Anderson.
298.581	In 1902 in New York City,
300.778	she was visiting.
303.016	It was a cold, wet, snowy day
303.016	and she was warm inside a streetcar.
309.226	As she was going to her destination,
309.226	she noticed the driver opening the window
314.323	to clean off the excess snow
314.323	so he could drive safely.
320.258	When he opened the window, though,
320.258	he let all this cold, wet air inside,
323.834	making all the passengers miserable.
327.189	Now probably, most of those 
327.189	passengers just thought,
330.122	"""It's a fact of life, he's got"
330.122	to open the window to clean it.
333.373	"That's just how it is."""
335.176	But Mary didn't.
336.711	Mary thought,
338.01	"""What if the diver could actually clean"
338.01	the windshield from the inside
341.844	so that he could stay safe and drive
345.122	and the passengers could 
345.122	"actually stay warm?"""
348.603	So she picked up her sketchbook
348.603	right then and there,
351.355	and began drawing what would become
351.355	the world's first windshield wiper.
356.924	Now as a product designer,
356.924	I try to learn from people like Mary
361.198	to try to see the world 
361.198	the way it really is,
363.973	not the way we think it is.
366.587	Why?
367.534	Because it's easy to solve a problem
367.534	that almost everyone sees.
371.894	But it's hard to solve a problem
371.894	that almost no one sees.
376.441	Now some people think
376.441	you're born with this ability
379.169	or you're not,
380.75	as if Mary Anderson was hardwired at birth
380.75	to see the world more clearly.
386.883	That wasn't the case for me.
388.813	I had to work at it.
391.766	During my years at Apple,
394.395	Steve Jobs challenged us
394.395	to come into work every day,
399.142	to see our products through 
399.142	the eyes of the customer,
403.056	the new customer,
404.503	the one that has fears 
404.503	and possible frustrations
407.689	and hopeful exhilaration that their
407.689	new technology product
410.83	could work straightaway for them.
413.471	He called it staying beginners,
415.705	and wanted to make sure that we
415.705	focused on those tiny little details
419.687	to make them faster, easier and seamless
419.687	for the new customers.
424.558	So I remember this clearly
424.558	in the very earliest days of the iPod.
429.028	See, back in the '90s,
430.698	being a gadget freak like I am,
435.107	I would rush out to the store
435.107	for the very, very latest gadget.
441.291	I'd take all the time to get to the store,
443.353	I'd check out, I'd come back home,
443.353	I'd start to unbox it.
446.964	And then, there was 
446.964	another little sticker:
450.89	"the one that said, ""Charge before use."""
454.005	What!
455.553	I can't believe it!
456.558	I just spent all this time
456.558	buying this product
458.734	and now I have to charge before use.
460.768	I have to wait what felt like an eternity
460.768	to use that coveted new toy.
465.158	It was crazy.
466.85	But you know what?
467.755	Almost every product back then did that.
469.838	When it had batteries in it,
471.613	you had to charge it
471.613	before you used it.
474.69	Well, Steve noticed that
477.136	and he said,
477.967	"""We're not going to let that "
477.967	"happen to our product."""
480.565	So what did we do?
482.413	Typically, when you have a product
482.413	that has a hard drive in it,
485.499	you run it for about 
488.162	to make sure that hard drive's going 
488.162	to be working years later
491.311	for the customer after they 
491.311	pull it out of the box.
494.385	What did we do instead?
497.451	We ran that product for over two hours.
499.541	Why?
501.129	Well, first off, we could make
501.129	a higher quality product,
504.254	be easy to test,
506.404	and make sure it was great
506.404	for the customer.
509.906	But most importantly,
511.159	the battery came fully charged
511.159	right out of the box,
514.178	ready to use.
515.124	So that customer, 
515.124	with all that exhilaration,
518.956	could just start using the product.
520.684	It was great, and it worked.
523.074	People liked it.
524.338	Today, almost every product
524.338	that you get that's battery powered
527.445	comes out of the box fully charged,
529.508	even if it doesn't have a hard drive.
532.131	But back then, we noticed 
532.131	that detail and we fixed it,
536.905	and now everyone else does that as well.
539.253	"No more, ""Charge before use."""
542.644	So why am I telling you this?
544.701	Well, it's seeing the invisible problem,
546.809	not just the obvious problem,
546.809	that's important,
551.32	not just for product design,
551.32	but for everything we do.
554.682	You see, there are invisible problems
554.682	all around us,
558.206	ones we can solve.
560.462	But first we need
560.462	to see them, to feel them.
564.996	So, I'm hesitant to give you any tips
566.964	about neuroscience or psychology.
569.695	There's far too many experienced people
569.695	in the TED community
572.689	who would know much more
572.689	about that than I ever will.
576.083	But let me leave you with
576.083	a few tips that I do,
578.71	that we all can do,
578.71	to fight habituation.
582.383	My first tip is to look broader.
585.777	You see, when you're tackling a problem,
587.889	sometimes, there are a lot of steps
587.889	that lead up to that problem.
591.281	And sometimes, a lot 
591.281	of steps after it.
594.351	If you can take a step back
594.351	and look broader,
597.7	maybe you can change some of those boxes
599.971	before the problem.
600.977	Maybe you can combine them.
602.337	Maybe you can remove them altogether
602.337	to make that better.
606.258	Take thermostats, for instance.
608.249	In the 1900s when they first came out,
608.249	they were really simple to use.
611.627	You could turn them up or turn them down.
613.579	People understood them.
616.019	But in the 1970s,
617.772	the energy crisis struck,
619.846	and customers started thinking about
619.846	how to save energy.
623.416	So what happened?
624.703	Thermostat designers decided 
624.703	to add a new step.
627.731	Instead of just turning up and down,
629.581	you now had to program it.
631.572	So you could tell it the temperature
631.572	you wanted at a certain time.
634.79	Now that seemed great.
636.586	Every thermostat had
636.586	started adding that feature.
640.064	But it turned out that no one
640.064	saved any energy.
644.34	Now, why is that?
645.853	Well, people couldn't predict the future.
648.588	They just didn't know how their weeks
648.588	would change season to season,
652.136	year to year.
654.414	So no one was saving energy,
656.745	and what happened?
657.727	Thermostat designers went back
657.727	to the drawing board
660.35	and they focused on that programming step.
662.942	They made better U.I.s,
665.409	they made better documentation.
667.575	But still, years later,
667.575	people were not saving any energy
672.305	because they just couldn't
672.305	predict the future.
675.431	So what did we do?
676.909	We put a machine-learning algorithm in
676.909	instead of the programming
680.978	that would simply watch
680.978	when you turned it up and down,
683.676	when you liked a certain temperature
683.676	when you got up,
686.27	or when you went away.
687.977	And you know what?
689.245	It worked.
690.422	People are saving energy 
690.422	without any programming.
695.239	So, it doesn't matter what you're doing.
697.246	If you take a step back 
697.246	and look at all the boxes,
700.512	maybe there's a way
700.512	to remove one or combine them
703.533	so that you can make 
703.533	that process much simpler.
707.007	So that's my first tip: look broader.
710.084	For my second tip, it's to look closer.
714.065	One of my greatest teachers 
714.065	was my grandfather.
719.006	He taught me all about the world.
721.557	He taught me how things were built
721.557	and how they were repaired,
725.049	the tools and techniques necessary
725.049	to make a successful project.
729.671	I remember one story 
729.671	he told me about screws,
734.048	and about how you need to have
734.048	the right screw for the right job.
737.678	There are many different screws:
739.617	wood screws, metal screws,
739.617	anchors, concrete screws,
744.487	the list went on and on.
747.212	Our job is to make products
747.212	that are easy to install
750.485	for all of our customs themselves
750.485	without professionals.
754.789	So what did we do?
756.72	I remembered that story 
756.72	that my grandfather told me,
759.655	and so we thought,
760.928	"""How many different screws "
760.928	can we put in the box?
763.428	Was it going to be two, three,
763.428	four, five?
766.278	Because there's so many
766.278	"different wall types."""
768.574	So we thought about it, we optimized it,
771.304	and we came up with three different
771.304	screws to put in the box.
775.845	We thought that was going
775.845	to solve the problem.
778.122	But it turned out, it didn't.
781.527	So we shipped the product,
783.158	and people weren't having
783.158	a great experience.
786.128	So what did we do?
787.336	We went back to the drawing board
789.081	just instantly after we figured out
789.081	we didn't get it right.
792.545	And we designed a special screw,
792.545	a custom screw,
796.269	much to the chagrin of our investors.
798.44	"They were like, ""Why are you spending"
798.44	so much time on a little screw?
801.862	"Get out there and sell more!"""
803.861	"And we said, ""We will sell more"
803.861	"if we get this right."""
807.904	And it turned out, we did.
809.594	With that custom little screw,
809.594	there was just one screw in the box,
812.888	that was easy to mount
812.888	and put on the wall.
817.525	So if we focus on those tiny details,
817.525	the ones we may not see
824.404	and we look at them as we say,
826.228	"""Are those important"
827.636	or is that the way we've always done it?
830.436	"Maybe there's a way to get rid of those."""
834.22	So my last piece of advice
834.22	is to think younger.
840.389	Every day, I'm confronted with interesting
840.389	questions from my three young kids.
844.545	They come up with questions like,
846.316	"""Why can't cars fly around traffic?"""
849.644	"Or, ""Why don't my shoelaces"
849.644	"have Velcro instead?"""
854.49	Sometimes, those questions are smart.
857.409	My son came to me the other day
857.409	and I asked him,
859.947	"""Go run out to the mailbox "
859.947	"and check it."""
863.123	He looked at me, puzzled, and said,
867.311	"""Why doesn't the mailbox just check itself"
867.311	"and tell us when it has mail?"" (Laughter)"
872.225	"I was like, ""That's a pretty "
872.225	"good question."""
876.878	So, they can ask tons of questions
879.492	and sometimes we find out
879.492	we just don't have the right answers.
884.21	"We say, ""Son, that's just the way"
884.21	"the world works."""
890.017	So the more we're exposed to something,
892.567	the more we get used to it.
894.764	But kids haven't been around 
894.764	long enough
896.894	to get used to those things.
898.794	And so when they run into problems,
900.611	they immediately try to solve them,
902.834	and sometimes they find a better way,
905.576	and that way really is better.
908.28	So my advice that we take to heart
908.28	is to have young people on your team,
914.119	or people with young minds.
916.225	Because if you have those young minds,
918.576	they cause everyone in the room
918.576	to think younger.
921.736	Picasso once said, 
921.736	"""Every child is an artist."
927.09	The problem is when he or she grows up,
927.09	"is how to remain an artist."""
933.785	We all saw the world more clearly
933.785	when we saw it for the first time,
937.734	before a lifetime of habits 
937.734	got in the way.
940.998	Our challenge is to get back there,
943.341	to feel that frustration,
945.586	to see those little details,
947.926	to look broader,
949.666	look closer,
951.422	and to think younger
953.792	so we can stay beginners.
956.15	It's not easy.
957.373	It requires us pushing back
958.908	against one of the most basic ways
958.908	we make sense of the world.
963.689	But if we do,
964.732	we could do some pretty amazing things.
967.243	For me, hopefully, that's better
967.243	product design.
970.94	For you, that could mean something else,
970.94	something powerful.
978.105	Our challenge is to wake up 
978.105	each day and say,
981.169	"""How can I experience the world better?"""
984.344	And if we do, maybe, just maybe,
989.193	we can get rid of these
989.193	dumb little stickers.
994.248	Thank you very much.
995.797	(Applause)
