14.76	Here's a question that matters.
16.88	[Is it ethical to evolve the human body?]
18.88	Because we're beginning to get all
18.88	the tools together to evolve ourselves.
22.4	And we can evolve bacteria
22.4	and we can evolve plants
24.84	and we can evolve animals,
26.28	and we're now reaching a point
26.28	where we really have to ask,
29.12	is it really ethical
29.12	and do we want to evolve human beings?
33.44	And as you're thinking about that,
35.36	let me talk about that
35.36	in the context of prosthetics,
39.12	prosthetics past, present, future.
42.92	So this is the iron hand
44.52	that belonged to one of the German counts.
46.88	Loved to fight, lost his arm
46.88	in one of these battles.
51.32	No problem, he just made a suit of armor,
53.8	put it on,
55.16	perfect prosthetic.
56.44	That's where the concept
56.44	of ruling with an iron fist comes from.
61.6	And of course these prosthetics
61.6	have been getting more and more useful,
65.08	more and more modern.
66.36	You can hold soft-boiled eggs.
68.84	You can have all types of controls,
68.84	and as you're thinking about that,
72.36	there are wonderful people like Hugh Herr
74.4	who have been building
74.4	absolutely extraordinary prosthetics.
77.72	So the wonderful Aimee Mullins
77.72	will go out and say,
80.56	how tall do I want to be tonight?
83.04	Or Hugh will say what type of cliff
83.04	do I want to climb?
85.96	Or does somebody want to run a marathon,
85.96	or does somebody want to ballroom dance?
90.48	And as you adapt these things,
92.48	the interesting thing about prosthetics
92.48	is they've been coming inside the body.
96.64	So these external prosthetics
96.64	have now become artificial knees.
99.64	They've become artificial hips.
101.72	And then they've evolved further
103.96	to become not just nice to have
106	but essential to have.
107.92	So when you're talking
107.92	about a heart pacemaker as a prosthetic,
111.8	you're talking about something
111.8	"that isn't just, ""I'm missing my leg,"""
115.52	"it's, ""if I don't have this, I can die."""
117.96	And at that point, a prosthetic
117.96	becomes a symbiotic relationship
122.08	with the human body.
124.56	And four of the smartest people
124.56	that I've ever met --
127.12	Ed Boyden, Hugh Herr,
127.12	Joe Jacobson, Bob Lander --
132.4	are working on a Center
132.4	for Extreme Bionics.
135	And the interesting thing
135	of what you're seeing here is
137.64	these prosthetics
137.64	now get integrated into the bone.
140.08	They get integrated into the skin.
141.759	They get integrated into the muscle.
144.36	And one of the other sides of Ed
147.36	is he's been thinking
147.36	about how to connect the brain
150.28	using light or other mechanisms
153	directly to things like these prosthetics.
156.52	And if you can do that,
157.8	then you can begin changing
157.8	fundamental aspects of humanity.
161.84	So how quickly you react to something
161.84	depends on the diameter of a nerve.
166.92	And of course, if you have nerves
166.92	that are external or prosthetic,
171.6	say with light or liquid metal,
174.28	then you can increase that diameter
176	and you could even increase it
176	theoretically to the point where,
179.08	as long as you could see the muzzle flash,
179.08	you could step out of the way of a bullet.
183.84	Those are the order of magnitude
183.84	of changes you're talking about.
188.2	This is a fourth
188.2	sort of level of prosthetics.
190.8	These are Phonak hearing aids,
193.36	and the reason
193.36	why these are so interesting
195.44	is because they cross the threshold
195.44	from where prosthetics are something
198.88	"for somebody who is ""disabled"""
201.56	and they become something
201.56	"that somebody who is ""normal"""
205.64	might want to actually have,
207.56	because what this prosthetic does,
207.56	which is really interesting,
210.56	is not only does it help you hear,
212.24	you can focus your hearing,
213.6	so it can hear the conversation
213.6	going on over there.
216.08	You can have superhearing.
217.36	You can have hearing in 360 degrees.
217.36	You can have white noise.
220.32	You can record, and oh, by the way,
220.32	they also put a phone into this.
224.44	So this functions as your hearing aid
224.44	and also as your phone.
227.92	And at that point, somebody might actually
227.92	want to have a prosthetic voluntarily.
234.4	All of these thousands
234.4	of loosely connected little pieces
237.12	are coming together,
239.12	and it's about time we ask the question,
241.08	how do we want to evolve human beings
241.08	over the next century or two?
245.64	And for that we turn
245.64	to a great philosopher
248.92	who was a very smart man
248.92	despite being a Yankee fan.
252	(Laughter)
254.8	And Yogi Berra used to say, of course,
254.8	that it's very tough to make predictions,
258.64	especially about the future.
260.04	(Laughter)
261.16	So instead of making a prediction
261.16	about the future to begin with,
264.24	let's take what's happening in the present
264.24	with people like Tony Atala,
267.6	who is redesigning 30-some-odd organs.
271.2	And maybe the ultimate prosthetic
271.2	isn't having something external, titanium.
274.8	Maybe the ultimate prosthetic
274.8	is take your own gene code,
277.52	remake your own body parts,
279.92	because that's a whole lot more effective
279.92	than any kind of a prosthetic.
284.44	But while you're at it, then you can take
284.44	the work of Craig Venter and Ham Smith.
288.48	And one of the things
288.48	that we've been doing
290.56	is trying to figure out
290.56	how to reprogram cells.
294.28	And if you can reprogram a cell,
295.88	then you can change the cells
295.88	in those organs.
299.4	So if you can change
299.4	the cells in those organs,
301.64	maybe you make those organs
301.64	more radiation-resistant.
304.16	Maybe you make them absorb more oxygen.
306.08	Maybe you make them more efficient
307.76	to filter out stuff
307.76	that you don't want in your body.
311.44	And over the last few weeks,
311.44	George Church has been in the news a lot
315.12	because he's been talking about taking
315.12	one of these programmable cells
318.44	and inserting an entire human genome
320.2	into that cell.
322.48	And once you can insert
322.48	an entire human genome into a cell,
326.32	then you begin to ask the question,
328.48	would you want
328.48	to enhance any of that genome?
333.44	Do you want to enhance a human body?
335.8	How would you want
335.8	to enhance a human body?
338.12	Where is it ethical
338.12	to enhance a human body
340.24	and where is it not ethical
340.24	to enhance a human body?
343.52	And all of a sudden, what we're doing
345.44	is we've got this
345.44	multidimensional chess board
348.4	where we can change
348.4	human genetics by using viruses
351.68	to attack things like AIDS,
354.12	or we can change the gene code
354.12	through gene therapy
356.56	to do away with some hereditary diseases,
359.52	or we can change the environment,
361.16	and change the expression
361.16	of those genes in the epigenome
363.851	and pass that on to the next generations.
367.32	And all of a sudden,
367.32	it's not just one little bit,
370.48	it's all these stacked little bits
372.36	that allow you
372.36	to take little portions of it
375.28	until all the portions coming together
378.16	lead you to something
378.16	that's very different.
381.6	And a lot of people
381.6	are very scared by this stuff.
384.36	And it does sound scary,
384.36	and there are risks to this stuff.
388.04	So why in the world would you
388.04	ever want to do this stuff?
390.76	Why would we really want
390.76	to alter the human body
393.8	in a fundamental way?
397.04	The answer lies in part
399.36	with Lord Rees,
401.24	astronomer royal of Great Britain.
404.56	And one of his favorite sayings
404.56	is the universe is 100 percent malevolent.
408.4	So what does that mean?
409.64	It means if you take
409.64	any one of your bodies at random,
412.56	drop it anywhere in the universe,
414.48	drop it in space, you die.
416.72	Drop it on the Sun, you die.
418.12	Drop it on the surface
418.12	of Mercury, you die.
420.16	Drop it near a supernova, you die.
422.24	But fortunately, it's only
422.24	about 80 percent effective.
426.64	So as a great physicist once said,
430	there's these little
430	upstream eddies of biology
434.16	that create order
434.16	in this rapid torrent of entropy.
440.08	So as the universe dissipates energy,
443.08	there's these upstream eddies
443.08	that create biological order.
447.96	Now, the problem with eddies is,
450.4	they tend to disappear.
451.92	They shift. They move in rivers.
454.68	And because of that, when an eddy shifts,
456.68	when the Earth becomes a snowball,
456.68	when the Earth becomes very hot,
460.24	when the Earth gets hit by an asteroid,
460.24	when you have supervolcanoes,
463.52	when you have solar flares,
465.4	when you have potentially
465.4	extinction-level events
468.76	like the next election --
470	(Laughter)
473.44	then all of a sudden,
473.44	you can have periodic extinctions.
477.4	And by the way, that's happened
477.4	five times on Earth,
480.36	and therefore it is very likely
482.48	that the human species on Earth
482.48	is going to go extinct someday.
486.44	Not next week,
487.96	not next month,
489.8	maybe in November,
489.8	but maybe 10,000 years after that.
493.88	As you're thinking
493.88	of the consequence of that,
496.72	if you believe that extinctions
496.72	are common and natural
500.16	and normal and occur periodically,
502.48	it becomes a moral imperative
502.48	to diversify our species.
506.52	And it becomes a moral imperative
508.16	because it's going to be
508.16	really hard to live on Mars
511.16	if we don't fundamentally
511.16	modify the human body.
514.88	Right?
516.12	You go from one cell,
517.48	mom and dad coming together
517.48	to make one cell,
519.72	in a cascade to 10 trillion cells.
521.92	We don't know, if you change
521.92	the gravity substantially,
526.4	if the same thing will happen
526.4	to create your body.
530.159	We do know that if you expose
530.159	our bodies as they currently are
533.24	to a lot of radiation, we will die.
537.04	So as you're thinking of that,
537.04	you have to really redesign things
540.12	just to get to Mars.
541.4	Forget about the moons
541.4	of Neptune or Jupiter.
545	And to borrow from Nikolai Kardashev,
547.48	let's think about life
547.48	in a series of scales.
549.68	So Life One civilization
552.2	is a civilization that begins
552.2	to alter his or her looks.
556.08	And we've been doing that
556.08	for thousands of years.
558.4	You've got tummy tucks
558.4	and you've got this and you've got that.
562.28	You alter your looks, and I'm told
564.72	that not all of those alterations
564.72	take place for medical reasons.
568.68	(Laughter)
570.76	Seems odd.
572.36	A Life Two civilization
572.36	is a different civilization.
576.32	A Life Two civilization alters
576.32	fundamental aspects of the body.
581.84	So you put human growth hormone in,
581.84	the person grows taller,
584.72	or you put x in and the person
584.72	gets fatter or loses metabolism
588.68	or does a whole series of things,
590.32	but you're altering the functions
590.32	in a fundamental way.
593.04	To become an intrasolar civilization,
595.68	we're going to have to create
595.68	a Life Three civilization,
599.72	and that looks very different
599.72	from what we've got here.
602.84	Maybe you splice in
602.84	Deinococcus radiodurans
605.08	so that the cells can resplice
605.08	after a lot of exposure to radiation.
610.32	Maybe you breathe by having oxygen
610.32	flow through your blood
613.36	instead of through your lungs.
615.6	But you're talking about
615.6	really radical redesigns,
619.48	and one of the interesting things
619.48	that's happened in the last decade
622.72	is we've discovered
622.72	a whole lot of planets out there.
625.48	And some of them may be Earth-like.
629.44	The problem is, if we ever
629.44	want to get to these planets,
633.08	the fastest human objects --
634.76	Juno and Voyager
634.76	and the rest of this stuff --
637.36	take tens of thousands of years
639.88	to get from here
639.88	to the nearest solar system.
642.72	So if you want to start exploring
642.72	beaches somewhere else,
646.4	or you want to see two-sun sunsets,
649.84	then you're talking
649.84	about something that is very different,
653	because you have to change
653	the timescale and the body of humans
658.08	in ways which may be
658.08	absolutely unrecognizable.
662	And that's a Life Four civilization.
665.72	Now, we can't even begin
665.72	to imagine what that might look like,
668.68	but we're beginning to get glimpses
671.04	of instruments that might
671.04	take us even that far.
674.96	And let me give you two examples.
676.6	So this is the wonderful Floyd Romesberg,
679.2	and one of the things
679.2	that Floyd's been doing
681.36	is he's been playing
681.36	with the basic chemistry of life.
683.92	So all life on this planet
683.92	is made in ATCGs, the four letters of DNA.
688.8	All bacteria, all plants,
688.8	all animals, all humans, all cows,
691.96	everything else.
694.44	And what Floyd did is he changed out
694.44	two of those base pairs,
698.64	so it's ATXY.
701.76	And that means that you now have
701.76	a parallel system to make life,
707.48	to make babies, to reproduce, to evolve,
711.8	that doesn't mate
711.8	with most things on Earth
714	or in fact maybe with nothing on Earth.
716.88	Maybe you make plants
716.88	that are immune to all bacteria.
719.44	Maybe you make plants
719.44	that are immune to all viruses.
721.96	But why is that so interesting?
723.52	It means that we
723.52	are not a unique solution.
727.4	It means you can create
727.4	alternate chemistries to us
731.16	that could be chemistries
731.16	adaptable to a very different planet
736	that could create life and heredity.
740.12	The second experiment,
742.48	or the other implication
742.48	of this experiment,
745.36	is that all of you, all life
745.36	is based on 20 amino acids.
749.6	If you don't substitute two amino acids,
752.08	if you don't say ATXY,
752.08	if you say ATCG + XY,
757.68	then you go from
761.52	and all of a sudden you've got
764.68	to build life-forms
764.68	in very different shapes.
769.48	The second experiment to think about
769.48	is a really weird experiment
772.56	that's been taking place in China.
775.92	So this guy has been transplanting
775.92	hundreds of mouse heads.
780.92	Right?
782.32	And why is that an interesting experiment?
785.44	Well, think of the first
785.44	heart transplants.
787.52	One of the things they used to do
789.16	is they used to bring in
789.16	the wife or the daughter of the donor
792.72	so the donee could tell the doctors,
796.64	"""Do you recognize this person?"
796.64	Do you love this person?
799.28	"Do you feel anything for this person?"""
801.16	We laugh about that today.
803.56	We laugh because we know
803.56	the heart is a muscle,
805.8	but for hundreds of thousands of years,
805.8	or tens of thousands of years,
809.32	"""I gave her my heart."
809.32	"She took my heart. She broke my heart."""
812.24	We thought this was emotion
813.64	and we thought maybe emotions
813.64	were transplanted with the heart. Nope.
818	So how about the brain?
821.04	Two possible outcomes to this experiment.
823.88	If you can get a mouse
826.32	that is functional,
827.96	then you can see,
830.04	is the new brain a blank slate?
833.28	And boy, does that have implications.
837.12	Second option:
838.8	the new mouse recognizes Minnie Mouse.
841.76	The new mouse
841.76	remembers what it's afraid of,
843.88	remembers how to navigate the maze,
845.6	and if that is true,
848.04	then you can transplant
848.04	memory and consciousness.
853.08	And then the really
853.08	interesting question is,
855.52	if you can transplant this,
855.52	is the only input-output mechanism
859.48	this down here?
861.44	Or could you transplant
861.44	that consciousness into something
864.16	that would be very different,
866.16	that would last in space,
867.44	that would last
867.44	tens of thousands of years,
869.52	that would be a completely redesigned body
871.544	that could hold consciousness
871.544	for a long, long period of time?
878.04	And let's come back to the first question:
880.56	Why would you ever want to do that?
884.32	Well, I'll tell you why.
885.6	Because this is the ultimate selfie.
888	(Laughter)
890.44	This is taken from six billion miles away,
894.04	and that's Earth.
896.8	And that's all of us.
899.24	And if that little thing goes,
899.24	all of humanity goes.
904.32	And the reason you want
904.32	to alter the human body
906.56	is because you eventually
906.56	want a picture that says,
909.36	that's us, and that's us,
911.32	and that's us,
912.76	because that's the way humanity
912.76	survives long-term extinction.
917.44	And that's the reason why it turns out
919.72	it's actually unethical
919.72	not to evolve the human body
923.68	even though it can be scary,
923.68	even though it can be challenging,
927.04	but it's what's going
927.04	to allow us to explore, live
930.44	and get to places
930.44	we can't even dream of today,
933.76	but which our great-great-great-great-
933.76	grandchildren might someday.
937.52	Thank you very much.
938.76	(Applause)
