12.537	In 1991 I had
14.363	maybe the most profound and transformative
17.121	experience of my life.
18.687	I was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree.
23.414	I took a couple victory laps in there.
25.605	And I was on a college choir tour up in Northern California,
29.827	and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus,
32.484	and we were relaxing next to this beautiful
34.55	idyllic lake in the mountains.
36.739	And there were crickets and birds and frogs making noise,
41.135	and as we sat there, over the mountains coming in
43.851	from the north were these Steven Spielbergian clouds
46.819	rolling toward us,
48.292	and as the clouds got about halfway over the valley,
50.939	so help me God, every single animal in that place
55.337	stopped making noise at the same time.
57.553	(Whoosh) This electric hush, as if they could sense what was about to happen.
62.637	And then the clouds came over us, and then,
64.697	boom! This massive thunderclap, and sheets of rain.
69.007	It was just extraordinary, and when I came back home
72.469	I found a poem by the Mexican poet Octavio Paz,
75.472	and decided to set it to music,
77.973	"a piece for choir called ""Cloudburst,"""
80.154	which is the piece that we'll perform for you in just a moment.
83.317	Now fast forward to just three years ago.
87.692	(Music) And we released to YouTube this,
91.133	the Virtual Choir Project,
96.596	You can see my little video there conducting these people,
100.033	alone in their dorm rooms
101.188	or in their living rooms at home.
104.277	Two years ago, on this very stage, we premiered
108.003	Virtual Choir 2,
111.55	2,052 singers from 58 different countries,
116.112	"this time performing a piece that I had written called ""Sleep."""
119.403	And then just last spring we released Virtual Choir 3,
124.697	"""Water Night,"" another piece that I had written,"
127.253	this time nearly 4,000 singers from 73 different countries.
133.517	(Music)
138.936	And when I was speaking to Chris about the future
141.943	of Virtual Choir and where we might be able to take this,
144.093	he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could.
148.854	Could we do this all in real time?
151.357	Could we have people singing together in real time?
154.397	And with the help of Skype,
155.992	that is what we are going to attempt today.
158.096	"Now, we'll perform ""Cloudburst"" for you."
160.269	The first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage.
163.421	I'm joined by singers from Cal State Long Beach,
165.917	Cal State Fullerton and Riverside Community College,
169.245	some of the best amateur choirs in the country, and â€”
172.565	(Applause) --
179.603	and in the second half of the piece,
181.789	the virtual choir will join us, 30 different singers
184.611	from 30 different countries.
186.661	Now, we've pushed the technology as far as it can go,
189.245	but there's still less than a second of latency,
192.077	but in musical terms, that's a lifetime.
194.156	We deal in milliseconds.
195.608	"So what I've done is, I've adapted ""Cloudburst"""
198.075	so that it embraces the latency
200.578	and the performers sing into the latency
203.483	instead of trying to be exactly together.
205.981	So with deep humility, and for your approval,
209.245	"we present ""Cloudburst."""
211.357	(Applause)
216.076	(Piano)
222.249	[The rain ...]
233.142	[Eyes of shadow-water]
238.253	[eyes of well-water]
256.512	[eyes of dream-water.]
267.439	[Blue suns, green whirlwinds,]
285.919	[birdbeaks of light pecking open]
293.687	[pomegranate stars.]
303.694	[But tell me, burnt earth, is there no water?]
322.311	[Only blood, only dust,]
330.239	[only naked footsteps on the thorns?]
346.903	[The rain awakens...]
364.271	[We must sleep with open eyes,]
367.583	[we must dream with our hands,]
380.14	[we must dream the dreams of a river seeking its course,]
385.191	[of the sun dreaming its worlds.]
399.628	[We must dream aloud,]
420.967	[we must sing till the song puts forth roots,]
447.759	[trunk, branches, birds, stars.]
477.475	[We must find the lost word,]
492.322	[and remember what the blood,]
500.187	[the tides, the earth, and the body say,]
526.991	[and return to the point of departure...]
544.561	(Music)
694.745	(Applause)
709.169	"[""Cloudburst"" Octavio Paz][translation by Lysander Kemp, adapted by Eric Whitacre]"
711.478	Eric Whitacre: Beth. Annabelle, where are you? Jacob.
718.881	(Applause)
740.622	Thank you.
