12.533	Five years ago, I was on a sabbatical,
15.089	and I returned to the medical university
17.481	where I studied.
19.343	I saw real patients and I wore the white coat
24.098	for the first time in 17 years,
26.907	in fact since I became a management consultant.
30.384	There were two things that surprised me
32.308	during the month I spent.
34.425	The first one was that the common theme
36.315	of the discussions we had were hospital budgets
39.823	and cost-cutting,
41.746	and the second thing, which really bothered me,
43.57	actually, was that several of the colleagues I met,
46.439	former friends from medical school,
48.5	who I knew to be some of the smartest,
50.637	most motivated, engaged and passionate people
53.606	I'd ever met,
55.16	many of them had turned cynical, disengaged,
59.091	or had distanced themselves
59.091	from hospital management.
62.598	So with this focus on cost-cutting,
65.372	I asked myself, are we forgetting the patient?
69.668	Many countries that you represent
71.672	and where I come from
73.269	struggle with the cost of healthcare.
76.175	It's a big part of the national budgets.
79.143	And many different reforms aim
79.143	at holding back this growth.
82.928	In some countries, we have long waiting times
84.945	for patients for surgery.
87.152	In other countries, new drugs
87.152	are not being reimbursed,
89.67	and therefore don't reach patients.
92.642	In several countries, doctors and nurses
94.899	are the targets, to some extent, for the governments.
98.956	After all, the costly decisions in health care
102.523	are taken by doctors and nurses.
104.991	You choose an expensive lab test,
107.531	you choose to operate on an old and frail patient.
111.158	So, by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians,
115.632	this is a way to hold costs down.
118.863	And ultimately, some physicians will say today
121.135	that they don't have the full liberty
123.802	to make the choices they think
123.802	are right for their patients.
127.322	So no wonder that some of my old colleagues
129.692	are frustrated.
132.058	At BCG, we looked at this,
134.509	and we asked ourselves,
136.34	this can't be the right way of managing healthcare.
139.852	And so we took a step back and we said,
143.072	"""What is it that we are trying to achieve?"""
145.744	Ultimately, in the healthcare system,
147.975	we're aiming at improving health for the patients,
151.936	and we need to do so at a limited,
154.213	or affordable, cost.
156.07	We call this value-based healthcare.
158.793	On the screen behind me, you see what we mean
160.477	by value:
162.286	outcomes that matter to patients
164.772	relative to the money we spend.
167.781	This was described beautifully in a book in 2006
170.526	by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg.
174.531	On this picture, you have my father-in-law
177.674	surrounded by his three beautiful daughters.
181.06	When we started doing our research at BCG,
184.096	we decided not to look so much at the costs,
186.756	but to look at the quality instead,
189.296	and in the research, one of the things
191.877	that fascinated us was the variation we saw.
194.919	You compare hospitals in a country,
197.292	you'll find some that are extremely good,
199.508	but you'll find a large number
199.508	that are vastly much worse.
202.953	The differences were dramatic.
205.115	Erik, my father-in-law,
207.177	he suffers from prostate cancer,
209.708	and he probably needs surgery.
212.018	Now living in Europe, he can
212.018	choose to go to Germany
214.725	that has a well-reputed healthcare system.
218.437	If he goes there and goes to the average hospital,
222.137	he will have the risk of becoming incontinent
226.211	by about 50 percent,
228.185	so he would have to start wearing diapers again.
231.158	You flip a coin. Fifty percent risk. That's quite a lot.
235.095	If he instead would go to Hamburg,
237.997	and to a clinic called the Martini-Klinik,
240.508	the risk would be only one in 20.
243.191	Either you a flip a coin,
244.776	or you have a one in 20 risk.
246.809	That's a huge difference, a seven-fold difference.
250.314	When we look at many hospitals
252.299	for many different diseases,
253.973	we see these huge differences.
256.99	But you and I don't know. We don't have the data.
259.884	And often, the data actually doesn't exist.
261.731	Nobody knows.
263.45	So going the hospital is a lottery.
267.803	Now, it doesn't have to be that way. There is hope.
272.083	In the late '70s, there were a group
274.575	of Swedish orthopedic surgeons
277.007	who met at their annual meeting,
278.866	and they were discussing the different procedures
280.827	they used to operate hip surgery.
284.131	To the left of this slide, you see a variety
285.859	of metal pieces, artificial hips that you would use
288.896	for somebody who needs a new hip.
291.755	They all realized they had
291.755	their individual way of operating.
295.004	"They all argued that, ""My technique is the best,"""
297.401	but none of them actually knew,
297.401	and they admitted that.
300.274	"So they said, ""We probably need to measure quality"
304.223	"so we know and can learn from what's best."""
308.392	So they in fact spent two years debating,
311.591	"""So what is quality in hip surgery?"""
313.886	"""Oh, we should measure this."""
313.886	"""No, we should measure that."""
316.26	And they finally agreed.
318.311	And once they had agreed, they started measuring,
320.962	and started sharing the data.
323.365	Very quickly, they found that if you put cement
325.964	in the bone of the patient
327.47	before you put the metal shaft in,
329.648	it actually lasted a lot longer,
331.784	and most patients would never have to be
333.542	re-operated on in their lifetime.
335.903	They published the data,
337.571	and it actually transformed
337.571	clinical practice in the country.
340.694	Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense.
343.985	Since then, they publish every year.
346.022	Once a year, they publish the league table:
347.97	who's best, who's at the bottom?
350.457	And they visit each other to try to learn,
353.137	so a continuous cycle of improvement.
356.927	For many years, Swedish hip surgeons
359.734	had the best results in the world,
362.121	at least for those who actually were measuring,
364.599	and many were not.
367.035	Now I found this principle really exciting.
369.917	So the physicians get together,
371.72	they agree on what quality is,
373.845	they start measuring, they share the data,
377.559	they find who's best, and they learn from it.
381.075	Continuous improvement.
383.667	Now, that's not the only exciting part.
386.215	That's exciting in itself.
388.466	But if you bring back the cost side of the equation,
391.417	and look at that,
392.877	it turns out, those who have focused on quality,
395.882	they actually also have the lowest costs,
397.915	although that's not been the purpose
397.915	in the first place.
400.584	So if you look at the hip surgery story again,
403.614	there was a study done a couple years ago
405.985	where they compared the U.S. and Sweden.
409.983	They looked at how many patients have needed
411.908	to be re-operated on seven years after the first surgery.
415.989	In the United States, the number was three times
418.876	higher than in Sweden.
421.064	So many unnecessary surgeries,
424.504	and so much unnecessary suffering
427.244	for all the patients who were operated on
428.936	in that seven year period.
431.403	Now, you can imagine how much savings
432.982	there would be for society.
435.482	We did a study where we looked at OECD data.
438.653	OECD does, every so often,
441.503	look at quality of care
443.659	where they can find the data
443.659	across the member countries.
448.184	The United States has, for many diseases,
450.786	actually a quality which is below the average
452.99	in OECD.
454.408	Now, if the American healthcare system
456.562	would focus a lot more on measuring quality,
458.998	and raise quality just to the level of average OECD,
463.047	it would save the American people
469.511	That's 20 percent of the budget,
472.738	of the healthcare budget of the country.
475.451	Now you may say that these numbers
477.558	are fantastic, and it's all logical,
480.449	but is it possible?
482.459	This would be a paradigm shift in healthcare,
485.098	and I would argue that not only can it be done,
488.678	but it has to be done.
490.912	The agents of change are the doctors and nurses
494.303	in the healthcare system.
496.995	In my practice as a consultant,
499.109	I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred
501.376	doctors and nurses and other hospital
504.253	or healthcare staff every year.
507.21	The one thing they have in common is
509.396	they really care about what they achieve
511.674	in terms of quality for their patients.
514.908	Physicians are, like most of you in the audience,
516.991	very competitive.
519.527	They were always best in class.
521.277	We were always best in class.
524.775	And if somebody can show them that the result
527.389	they perform for their patients
528.976	is no better than what others do,
531.83	they will do whatever it takes to improve.
534.537	But most of them don't know.
536.87	But physicians have another characteristic.
539.285	They actually thrive from peer recognition.
543.127	If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist
545.361	in a competing hospital
547.209	and discusses why that other hospital
549.238	has so much better results, they will share.
552.033	They will share the information on how to improve.
555.75	So it is, by measuring and creating transparency,
559.87	you get a cycle of continuous improvement,
562.78	which is what this slide shows.
565.654	Now, you may say this is a nice idea,
568.595	but this isn't only an idea.
570.499	This is happening in reality.
572.527	We're creating a global community,
575.681	and a large global community,
577.544	where we'll be able to measure and compare
580.091	what we achieve.
581.805	Together with two academic institutions,
584.432	Michael Porter at Harvard Business School,
586.426	and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden,
588.31	BCG has formed something we call ICHOM.
592.275	You may think that's a sneeze,
594.48	but it's not a sneeze, it's an acronym.
597.607	It stands for the International Consortium
600.183	for Health Outcome Measurement.
603.143	We're bringing together leading physicians
605.892	and patients to discuss, disease by disease,
609.483	what is really quality,
611.585	what should we measure,
613.572	and to make those standards global.
616.06	They've worked -- four working groups have worked
618.415	during the past year:
620.383	cataracts, back pain,
623.227	coronary artery disease, which is,
623.227	for instance, heart attack,
627.453	and prostate cancer.
629.634	The four groups will publish their data
632.038	in November of this year.
633.88	That's the first time we'll be comparing
636.338	apples to apples, not only within a country,
639.284	but between countries.
642.465	Next year, we're planning to do eight diseases,
646.443	the year after, 16.
648.997	In three years' time, we plan to have covered
654.566	Compare apples to apples. Who's better?
657.216	Why is that?
660.267	Five months ago,
663.132	I led a workshop at the largest university hospital
666.166	in Northern Europe.
667.876	They have a new CEO, and she has a vision:
671.363	I want to manage my big institution much more
674.969	on quality, outcomes that matter to patients.
679.074	This particular day, we sat in a workshop
682.572	together with physicians, nurses and other staff,
685.382	discussing leukemia in children.
689.88	The group discussed,
691.657	how do we measure quality today?
693.697	Can we measure it better than we do?
696.262	We discussed, how do we treat these kids,
698.484	what are important improvements?
700.535	And we discussed what are
700.535	the costs for these patients,
703.316	can we do treatment more efficiently?
705.664	There was an enormous energy in the room.
707.608	There were so many ideas, so much enthusiasm.
711.097	At the end of the meeting,
713.391	the chairman of the department, he stood up.
716.7	He looked over the group and he said --
721.277	first he raised his hand, I forgot that --
723.062	he raised his hand, clenched his fist,
725.531	"and then he said to the group, ""Thank you."
728.428	Thank you. Today, we're finally discussing
731.351	"what this hospital does the right way."""
734.925	By measuring value in healthcare,
737.012	that is not only costs
739.037	but outcomes that matter to patients,
741.51	we will make staff in hospitals
743.308	and elsewhere in the healthcare system
745.167	not a problem but an important part of the solution.
749.261	I believe measuring value in healthcare
751.197	will bring about a revolution,
753.968	and I'm convinced that the founder
756.077	of modern medicine, the Greek Hippocrates,
759.54	who always put the patient at the center,
762.49	he would smile in his grave.
764.652	Thank you.
767.453	(Applause)
