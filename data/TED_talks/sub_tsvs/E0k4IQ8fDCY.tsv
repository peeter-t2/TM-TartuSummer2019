12.758	In 2012, when I painted
12.758	the minaret of Jara Mosque
17.025	in my hometown of Gabés,
17.025	in the south of Tunisia,
19.98	I never thought that graffiti would bring
19.98	so much attention to a city.
25.271	At the beginning, I was just looking
25.271	for a wall in my hometown,
29.221	and it happened that the minaret
29.221	was built in '94.
33.102	And for 18 years, those 57 meters
33.102	of concrete stayed grey.
38.617	When I met the imam for the first time,
38.617	and I told him what I wanted to do,
42.242	"he was like, ""Thank God you finally came,"""
44.71	and he told me that for years
44.71	he was waiting for somebody
47.541	to do something on it.
49.422	The most amazing thing about this imam
49.422	is that he didn't ask me anything --
53.532	neither a sketch,
53.532	or what I was going to write.
57.959	In every work that I create,
57.959	I write messages
60.856	with my style of calligraffiti --
60.856	a mix of calligraphy and graffiti.
65.622	I use quotes or poetry.
68.153	For the minaret, I thought that
68.153	the most relevant message
70.884	to be put on a mosque
70.884	should come from the Quran,
73.524	so I picked this verse:
75.159	"""Oh humankind, we have created you"
75.159	from a male and a female,
78.423	and made you people and tribe,
78.423	"so you may know each other."""
81.862	It was a universal call for peace,
81.862	tolerance, and acceptance
85.203	coming from the side that we don't usually
85.203	portray in a good way in the media.
89.661	I was amazed to see how the local
89.661	community reacted to the painting,
93.453	and how it made them proud to see
93.453	the minaret getting so much attention
97.784	from international press
97.784	all around the world.
101.346	For the imam, it was not
101.346	just the painting;
103.538	it was really deeper than that.
105.427	He hoped that this minaret would become
105.427	a monument for the city,
108.888	and attract people
108.888	to this forgotten place of Tunisia.
112.759	The universality of the message,
114.933	the political context
114.933	of Tunisia at this time,
117.203	and the fact that I was writing
117.203	Quran in a graffiti way
120.711	were not insignificant.
122.377	It reunited the community.
125.559	Bringing people, future generations,
128.573	together through Arabic calligraphy
131.573	is what I do.
133.082	Writing messages is
133.082	the essence of my artwork.
136.896	What is funny, actually, is that
136.896	even Arabic-speaking people
140.071	really need to focus a lot
140.071	to decipher what I'm writing.
144.668	You don't need to know
144.668	the meaning to feel the piece.
148.012	I think that Arabic script touches
148.012	your soul before it reaches your eyes.
151.757	There is a beauty in it
151.757	that you don't need to translate.
155.628	Arabic script speaks to anyone, I believe;
157.93	to you, to you, to you, to anybody,
161.471	and then when you get the meaning,
163.431	you feel connected to it.
165.435	I always make sure to write messages
167.806	that are relevant to the place
167.806	where I'm painting,
170.201	but messages that have
170.201	a universal dimension,
173.306	so anybody around the world
173.306	can connect to it.
176.699	I was born and raised in France, in Paris,
179.05	and I started learning how to write
179.05	and read Arabic when I was 18.
183.56	Today I only write messages in Arabic.
187.084	One of the reasons
187.084	this is so important to me,
190.305	is because of all the reaction that
190.305	I've experienced all around the world.
195.7	In Rio de Janeiro, I translated
195.7	this Portuguese poem
199.63	from Gabriela Tôrres Barbosa,
201.566	who was giving an homage
201.566	to the poor people of the favela,
204.97	and then I painted it on the rooftop.
207.367	The local community were really
207.367	intrigued by what I was doing,
210.304	but as soon as I gave them
210.304	the meaning of the calligraphy,
213.921	they thanked me, as they felt
213.921	connected to the piece.
218.723	In South Africa, in Cape Town,
220.737	the local community of Philippi
223.81	offered me the only
223.81	concrete wall of the slum.
226.881	It was a school, and I wrote on it
229.278	a quote from Nelson Mandela,
230.77	"saying, ""[in Arabic],"""
233.457	"which means, ""It seems"
233.457	"impossible until it's done."""
236.489	Then this guy came to me and said,
236.489	"""Man, why you don't write in English?"""
240.098	"and I replied to him, ""I would consider"
240.098	your concern legit if you asked me
244.217	"why I didn't write in Zulu."""
246.912	In Paris, once, there was this event,
249.08	and someone gave his wall to be painted.
254.016	And when he saw I was painting in Arabic,
256.397	he got so mad -- actually, hysterical --
256.397	and he asked for the wall to be erased.
260.445	I was mad and disappointed.
262.436	But a week later, the organizer
262.436	of the event asked me to come back,
266.337	and he told me that there was a wall
266.337	right in front of this guy's house.
270.079	So, this guy --
271.255	(Laughter)
273.498	like, was forced to see it every day.
275.547	At the beginning, I was going
275.547	"to write, ""[In Arabic],"""
278.555	"which means, ""In your face,"" but --"
280.57	(Laughter)
282.937	I decided to be smarter
282.937	"and I wrote, ""[In Arabic],"""
286.62	"which means, ""Open your heart."""
289.095	I'm really proud of my culture,
292.195	and I'm trying to be an ambassador
292.195	of it through my artwork.
297.734	And I hope that I can break
297.734	the stereotypes we all know,
302.694	with the beauty of Arabic script.
305.207	Today, I don't write the translation
305.207	of the message anymore on the wall.
311.148	I don't want the poetry
311.148	of the calligraphy to be broken,
314.849	as it's art and you can appreciate it
314.849	without knowing the meaning,
318.054	as you can enjoy any music
318.054	from other countries.
321.63	Some people see that
321.63	as a rejection or a closed door,
325.429	but for me, it's more an invitation --
327.922	to my language,
327.922	to my culture, and to my art.
331.225	Thank you.
332.407	(Applause)
