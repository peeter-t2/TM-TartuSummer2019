21.406	There's so many of you.
23.105	(Laughter)
27.945	When I was a kid,
30.556	I hid my heart under the bed,
30.556	because my mother said,
33.064	"""If you're not careful,"
33.064	"someday someone's going to break it."""
36.698	Take it from me: Under the bed
36.698	is not a good hiding spot.
40.317	I know because I've been
40.317	shot down so many times,
42.717	I get altitude sickness
42.717	just from standing up for myself.
46.61	But that's what we were told.
48.61	"""Stand up for yourself."""
50.908	And that's hard to do
50.908	if you don't know who you are.
53.896	We were expected to define ourselves
53.896	at such an early age,
57.66	and if we didn't do it,
57.66	others did it for us.
60.978	Geek. Fatty.
62.487	Slut. Fag.
65.42	And at the same time we were
65.42	being told what we were,
68.911	we were being asked,
70.26	"""What do you want to be when you grow up?"""
73.213	I always thought
73.213	that was an unfair question.
75.339	It presupposes that we can't be
75.339	what we already are.
78.689	We were kids.
80.545	When I was a kid, I wanted to be a man.
83.615	I wanted a registered
83.615	retirement savings plan
85.818	that would keep me in candy
85.818	long enough to make old age sweet.
88.961	(Laughter)
90.166	When I was a kid, I wanted to shave.
92.626	Now, not so much.
94.468	(Laughter)
96.356	When I was eight,
96.356	I wanted to be a marine biologist.
99.771	"When I was nine, I saw the movie ""Jaws,"""
101.7	"and thought to myself, ""No, thank you."""
103.637	(Laughter)
105.153	And when I was 10,
106.328	I was told that my parents left
106.328	because they didn't want me.
109.185	When I was 11, I wanted to be left alone.
111.17	When I was 12, I wanted to die.
111.17	When I was 13, I wanted to kill a kid.
114.543	When I was 14, I was asked
114.543	to seriously consider a career path.
118.599	"I said, ""I'd like to be a writer."""
121.043	And they said,
121.043	"""Choose something realistic."""
123.915	"So I said, ""Professional wrestler."""
127.371	"And they said, ""Don't be stupid."""
129.699	See, they asked me what I wanted to be,
132.459	then told me what not to be.
134.823	And I wasn't the only one.
137.062	We were being told
137.062	that we somehow must become
139.321	what we are not, sacrificing what we are
141.308	to inherit the masquerade
141.308	of what we will be.
144.212	I was being told to accept the identity
144.212	that others will give me.
148.848	And I wondered, what made
148.848	my dreams so easy to dismiss?
152.921	Granted, my dreams are shy,
156.288	because they're Canadian.
158.005	(Laughter)
161.138	My dreams are self-conscious
161.138	and overly apologetic.
164.518	They're standing alone
164.518	at the high school dance,
166.828	and they've never been kissed.
169.391	See, my dreams got called names too.
172.221	Silly. Foolish.
174.879	Impossible.
176.054	But I kept dreaming.
177.802	I was going to be a wrestler.
177.802	I had it all figured out.
180.424	I was going to be The Garbage Man.
182.068	(Laughter)
183.093	My finishing move was going
183.093	to be The Trash Compactor.
186.546	My saying was going to be,
186.546	"""I'm taking out the trash!"""
189.688	(Laughter)
192.548	(Applause)
196.324	And then this guy,
196.324	"Duke ""The Dumpster"" Droese,"
201.096	stole my entire shtick.
202.84	(Laughter)
204.431	I was crushed,
206.557	as if by a trash compactor.
208.406	(Laughter)
210.928	I thought to myself,
210.928	"""What now? Where do I turn?"""
214.499	Poetry.
215.936	(Laughter)
217.338	Like a boomerang,
217.338	the thing I loved came back to me.
220.846	One of the first lines of poetry
220.846	I can remember writing
223.523	was in response to a world
223.523	that demanded I hate myself.
226.167	From age 15 to 18, I hated myself
228.587	for becoming the thing that I loathed:
231.411	a bully.
232.988	When I was 19, I wrote,
235.776	"""I will love myself"
235.776	despite the ease with which
238.325	"I lean toward the opposite."""
241.443	Standing up for yourself
241.443	doesn't have to mean
244.673	embracing violence.
247.122	When I was a kid,
248.999	I traded in homework
248.999	assignments for friendship,
251.73	then gave each friend a late slip
251.73	for never showing up on time,
254.753	and in most cases, not at all.
256.403	I gave myself a hall pass
256.403	to get through each broken promise.
259.537	And I remember this plan,
259.537	born out of frustration
261.888	"from a kid who kept calling me ""Yogi,"""
264.107	then pointed at my tummy and said,
264.107	"""Too many picnic baskets."""
267.848	Turns out it's not that hard
267.848	to trick someone,
270.294	and one day before class, I said,
271.89	"""Yeah, you can copy my homework,"""
273.959	and I gave him all the wrong answers
273.959	that I'd written down the night before.
277.934	He got his paper back
277.934	expecting a near-perfect score,
280.464	and couldn't believe it when he looked
280.464	across the room at me and held up a zero.
284.299	I knew I didn't have to hold up
284.299	my paper of 28 out of 30,
287.369	but my satisfaction was complete
287.369	when he looked at me, puzzled,
290.401	"and I thought to myself, ""Smarter"
290.401	"than the average bear, motherfucker."""
293.883	(Laughter)
295.689	(Applause)
301.943	This is who I am.
304.845	This is how I stand up for myself.
308.543	When I was a kid,
310.817	I used to think that pork chops
310.817	and karate chops were the same thing.
315.706	I thought they were both pork chops.
317.875	My grandmother thought it was cute,
319.653	and because they were my favorite,
319.653	she let me keep doing it.
322.487	Not really a big deal.
323.964	One day, before I realized fat kids
323.964	are not designed to climb trees,
327.747	I fell out of a tree
327.747	and bruised the right side of my body.
331.254	I didn't want to tell my grandmother
333.001	because I was scared I'd get in trouble
334.895	for playing somewhere
334.895	I shouldn't have been.
337.026	The gym teacher noticed the bruise,
337.026	and I got sent to the principal's office.
340.68	From there, I was sent to another
340.68	small room with a really nice lady
343.983	who asked me all kinds of questions
343.983	about my life at home.
348.094	I saw no reason to lie.
349.991	As far as I was concerned,
349.991	life was pretty good.
352.752	I told her, whenever I'm sad,
352.752	my grandmother gives me karate chops.
356.218	(Laughter)
364.162	This led to a full-scale investigation,
367.997	and I was removed
367.997	from the house for three days,
370.923	until they finally decided
370.923	to ask how I got the bruises.
374.461	News of this silly little story
374.461	quickly spread through the school,
377.629	and I earned my first nickname:
380.101	Porkchop.
382.156	To this day,
384.539	I hate pork chops.
388.416	I'm not the only kid who grew up this way,
391.464	surrounded by people
391.464	who used to say that rhyme
394.186	about sticks and stones,
396.622	as if broken bones hurt more
396.622	than the names we got called,
399.39	and we got called them all.
401.326	So we grew up believing
401.326	no one would ever fall in love with us,
404.91	that we'd be lonely forever,
407.239	that we'd never meet someone
407.239	to make us feel like the sun
409.975	was something they built
409.975	for us in their toolshed.
412.357	So broken heartstrings bled the blues,
414.206	and we tried to empty ourselves
414.206	so we'd feel nothing.
416.74	Don't tell me that hurts
416.74	less than a broken bone,
419.119	that an ingrown life
419.119	is something surgeons can cut away,
421.776	that there's no way
421.776	for it to metastasize; it does.
424.423	She was eight years old,
426.149	our first day of grade three
426.149	when she got called ugly.
429.419	We both got moved to the back of class
431.373	so we would stop
431.373	getting bombarded by spitballs.
434.355	But the school halls were a battleground.
436.35	We found ourselves outnumbered
436.35	day after wretched day.
438.903	We used to stay inside for recess,
438.903	because outside was worse.
442.249	Outside, we'd have
442.249	to rehearse running away,
444.372	or learn to stay still like statues,
444.372	giving no clues that we were there.
447.789	In grade five, they taped
447.789	a sign to the front of her desk
450.6	"that read, ""Beware of dog."""
453.23	To this day,
454.873	despite a loving husband,
454.873	she doesn't think she's beautiful,
458.47	because of a birthmark that takes up
458.47	a little less than half her face.
461.878	Kids used to say,
461.878	"""She looks like a wrong answer"
464.141	that someone tried to erase,
464.141	"but couldn't quite get the job done."""
467.325	And they'll never understand
467.325	that she's raising two kids
470.286	whose definition of beauty
470.286	"begins with the word ""Mom,"""
474.421	because they see her heart
474.421	before they see her skin,
476.899	because she's only ever
476.899	always been amazing.
479.938	He was a broken branch grafted
479.938	onto a different family tree,
483.962	adopted,
485.875	not because his parents opted
485.875	for a different destiny.
489.725	He was three when he became a mixed drink
491.702	of one part left alone
491.702	and two parts tragedy,
495.019	started therapy in eighth grade,
497.201	had a personality
497.201	made up of tests and pills,
500.029	lived like the uphills were mountains
500.029	and the downhills were cliffs,
503.821	four-fifths suicidal,
503.821	a tidal wave of antidepressants,
507.229	"and an adolescent being called ""Popper,"""
510.139	one part because of the pills,
514.973	He tried to kill himself in grade 10
517.537	when a kid who could still
517.537	go home to Mom and Dad
520.18	had the audacity to tell him,
520.18	"""Get over it."""
523.583	As if depression is something
523.583	that could be remedied
526.052	by any of the contents
526.052	found in a first-aid kit.
528.718	To this day, he is a stick of TNT
528.718	lit from both ends,
532.318	could describe to you in detail
532.318	the way the sky bends
534.845	in the moment before it's about to fall,
536.798	and despite an army of friends
536.798	who all call him an inspiration,
539.79	he remains a conversation piece
539.79	between people who can't understand
543.111	sometimes being drug-free
543.111	has less to do with addiction
546.14	and more to do with sanity.
549.225	We weren't the only kids
549.225	who grew up this way.
552.47	To this day, kids are still
552.47	being called names.
556.18	The classics were
556.18	"""Hey, stupid,"" ""Hey, spaz."""
561.069	Seems like every school
561.069	has an arsenal of names
563.849	getting updated every year.
566.047	And if a kid breaks in a school
566.047	and no one around chooses to hear,
569.214	do they make a sound?
570.588	Are they just background noise
570.588	from a soundtrack stuck on repeat,
573.753	when people say things like,
573.753	"""Kids can be cruel."""
577.788	Every school was a big top circus tent,
581.037	and the pecking order
581.037	went from acrobats to lion tamers,
583.876	from clowns to carnies,
583.876	all of these miles ahead of who we were.
587.249	We were freaks --
588.695	lobster-claw boys and bearded ladies,
591.316	oddities juggling
591.316	depression and loneliness,
593.426	playing solitaire, spin the bottle,
595.179	trying to kiss the wounded
595.179	parts of ourselves and heal,
597.823	but at night, while the others slept,
600.444	we kept walking the tightrope.
603.07	It was practice, and yes, some of us fell.
606.9	But I want to tell them that all of this
609.925	is just debris
611.964	left over when we finally decide to smash
611.964	all the things we thought we used to be,
616.692	and if you can't see anything
616.692	beautiful about yourself,
620.636	get a better mirror, look
620.636	a little closer, stare a little longer,
625.343	because there's something inside you
625.343	that made you keep trying
628.284	despite everyone who told you to quit.
630.208	You built a cast around your broken heart
632.275	"and signed it yourself, ""They were wrong."""
634.34	Because maybe you didn't belong
634.34	to a group or a clique.
636.967	Maybe they decided to pick you last
636.967	for basketball or everything.
640.048	Maybe you used to bring bruises and broken
640.048	teeth to show-and-tell, but never told,
643.932	because how can you hold your ground
645.679	if everyone around you
645.679	wants to bury you beneath it?
648.134	You have to believe that they were wrong.
651.695	They have to be wrong.
654.378	Why else would we still be here?
658.028	We grew up learning
658.028	to cheer on the underdog
660.373	because we see ourselves in them.
663.111	We stem from a root planted in the belief
665.259	that we are not what we were called.
667.984	We are not abandoned cars stalled out
667.984	and sitting empty on some highway,
672.297	and if in some way we are, don't worry.
674.216	We only got out to walk and get gas.
676.233	We are graduating members
676.233	from the class of We Made It,
679.536	not the faded echoes of voices crying out,
681.56	"""Names will never hurt me."""
686.274	Of course they did.
690.846	But our lives will only ever always
690.846	continue to be a balancing act
695.877	that has less to do with pain
698.853	and more to do with beauty.
702.663	(Applause)
