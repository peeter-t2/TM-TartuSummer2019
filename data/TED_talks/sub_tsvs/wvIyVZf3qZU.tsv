15.997	I was one of those kids that, every time I got in the car,
19.348	I basically had to roll down the window.
22.291	It was usually too hot, too stuffy or just too smelly,
26.503	and my father would not let us use the air conditioner.
28.857	He said that it would overheat the engine.
31.614	And you might remember, some of you,
33.262	how the cars were back then, and it was
35.162	a common problem of overheating.
37.528	But it was also the signal that capped the use,
41.548	or overuse, of energy-consuming devices.
45.97	Things have changed now. We have cars that we take across country.
49.009	We blast the air conditioning the entire way,
52.17	and we never experience overheating.
53.746	So there's no more signal for us to tell us to stop.
56.733	Great, right? Well, we have similar problems in buildings.
62.351	In the past, before air conditioning, we had thick walls.
65.817	The thick walls are great for insulation. It keeps the interior
68.496	very cool during the summertime, and warm during the wintertime,
72.014	and the small windows were also very good because
74.414	it limited the amount of temperature transfer
77.005	between the interior and exterior.
79.472	Then in about the 1930s, with the advent of plate glass,
83.344	rolled steel and mass production, we were able
86.74	to make floor-to-ceiling windows and unobstructed views,
90.19	and with that came the irreversible reliance on
93.916	mechanical air conditioning to cool our solar-heated spaces.
100.497	Over time, the buildings got taller and bigger,
103.601	our engineering even better, so that the mechanical systems
106.242	were massive. They require a huge amount of energy.
110.116	They give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere,
112.875	and for some of you may understand the heat island effect
116.075	in cities, where the urban areas are much more warm
119.585	than the adjacent rural areas,
122.535	but we also have problems that, when we lose power,
125.789	we can't open a window here, and so
128.55	the buildings are uninhabitable and have to be made vacant
131.364	until that air conditioning system can start up again.
135.012	Even worse, with our intention of trying to make buildings
139.067	move towards a net-zero energy state, we can't do it
144.052	just by making mechanical systems more and more efficient.
146.419	We need to look for something else, and we've gotten ourselves a little bit into a rut.
150.197	So what do we do here? How do we pull ourselves and dig us
154.448	out of this hole that we've dug?
157.299	If we look at biology, and many of you probably don't know,
160.208	I was a biology major before I went into architecture,
163.864	the human skin is the organ that naturally regulates
168.253	the temperature in the body, and it's a fantastic thing.
171.689	That's the first line of defense for the body.
174.304	It has pores, it has sweat glands, it has all these things
177.513	that work together very dynamically and very efficiently,
180.931	and so what I propose is that our building skins
183.435	should be more similar to human skin,
187.084	and by doing so can be much more dynamic, responsive
191.196	and differentiated, depending on where it is.
194.452	And this gets me back to my research.
196.385	What I proposed first doing is looking at a different material palette to do that.
201.695	I presently, or currently, work with smart materials,
204.606	and a smart thermo-bimetal.
206.325	First of all, I guess we call it smart because it requires
209.237	no controls and it requires no energy,
211.967	and that's a very big deal for architecture.
214.63	What it is, it's a lamination of two different metals together.
217.444	You can see that here by the different reflection on this side.
221.318	And because it has two different coefficients of expansion,
224.793	when heated, one side will expand faster than the other
228.09	and result in a curling action.
231.627	So in early prototypes I built these surfaces to try to see
235.333	how the curl would react to temperature and possibly allow
239.526	air to ventilate through the system,
242.631	and in other prototypes did surfaces where the multiplicity
245.86	of having these strips together can try to make
248.341	bigger movement happen when also heated,
252.415	and currently have this installation at the Materials &amp; Applications gallery
256.479	in Silver Lake, close by, and it's there until August, if you want to see it.
259.965	"It's called ""Bloom,"" and the surface is made completely"
262.863	out of thermo-bimetal, and its intention is to make this canopy
266.903	that does two things. One, it's a sun-shading device, so that
270.72	when the sun hits the surface, it constricts the amount of sun passing through,
274.73	and in other areas, it's a ventilating system,
278.099	so that hot, trapped air underneath can actually
280.252	move through and out when necessary.
284.13	You can see here in this time-lapse video that the sun,
288.261	as it moves across the surface, as well as the shade,
291.007	each of the tiles moves individually.
293.483	Keep in mind, with the digital technology that we have today,
295.995	this thing was made out of about 14,000 pieces
299.008	and there's no two pieces alike at all. Every single one is different.
303.737	And the great thing with that is the fact that we can calibrate
306.249	each one to be very, very specific to its location,
310.248	to the angle of the sun, and also how the thing actually curls.
315.194	So this kind of proof of concept project
318	has a lot of implications
319.964	to actual future application in architecture,
323.664	and in this case, here you see a house,
326.169	that's for a developer in China,
328.602	and it's actually a four-story glass box.
331.346	It's still with that glass box because we still want that visual access,
335.183	but now it's sheathed with this thermo-bimetal layer,
339.065	it's a screen that goes around it, and that layer can actually
341.53	open and close as that sun moves around on that surface.
345.558	In addition to that, it can also screen areas for privacy,
350.12	so that it can differentiate from some of the public areas
352.416	in the space during different times of day.
355.008	And what it basically implies is that, in houses now,
358.271	we don't need drapes or shutters or blinds anymore
361.688	because we can sheath the building with these things,
363.855	as well as control the amount of air conditioning you need inside that building.
369.422	I'm also looking at trying to develop some building components for the market,
372.811	and so here you see a pretty typical
375.3	double-glazed window panel, and in that panel,
380.031	between those two pieces of glass, that double-glazing,
382.958	I'm trying to work on making
385.135	a thermo-bimetal pattern system
387.204	so that when the sun hits that outside layer
389.876	and heats that interior cavity, that thermo-bimetal
394.52	will begin to curl, and what actually will happen then
397.296	is it'll start to block out the sun
399.599	in certain areas of the building,
401.473	and totally, if necessary.
403.414	And so you can imagine, even in this application, that
405.922	in a high-rise building where the panel systems go
408.599	from floor to floor up to 30, 40 floors, the entire surface
413.366	could be differentiated at different times of day
415.556	depending on how that sun moves across and hits that surface.
421.015	And these are some later studies that I'm working on
423.834	right now that are on the boards, where you can see,
426.098	in the bottom right-hand corner, with the red, it's actually
429.439	smaller pieces of thermometal, and it's actually going to,
431.717	we're trying to make it move like cilia or eyelashes.
436.963	This last project is also of components.
439.445	The influence -- and if you have noticed, one of my
443.302	spheres of influence is biology -- is from a grasshopper.
446.878	And grasshoppers have a different kind of breathing system.
449.485	They breathe through holes in their sides called spiracles,
452.887	and they bring the air through and it moves through their system to cool them down,
456.377	and so in this project, I'm trying to look at how we can
459.759	consider that in architecture too, how we can bring
461.941	air through holes in the sides of a building.
464.607	And so you see here some early studies of blocks,
467.58	where those holes are actually coming through,
470.093	and this is before the thermo-bimetal is applied,
473.813	and this is after the bimetal is applied. Sorry, it's a little
476.512	hard to see, but on the surfaces, you can see these red arrows.
479.72	On the left, it's when it's cold and the thermo-bimetal
482.898	is flat so it will constrict air from passing through the blocks,
486.5	and on the right, the thermo-bimetal curls
488.54	and allows that air to pass through, so those are two different
492.086	components that I'm working on, and again,
493.902	it's a completely different thing, because you can imagine
496.214	that air could potentially be coming through the walls
498.941	instead of opening windows.
501.822	So I want to leave you with one last impression about
504.51	the project, or this kind of work and using smart materials.
508.89	When you're tired of opening and closing those blinds
512.07	day after day, when you're on vacation
515.063	and there's no one there on the weekends to be turning off and on the controls,
519.102	or when there's a power outage, and you have
521.457	no electricity to rely on, these thermo-bimetals
524.478	will still be working tirelessly, efficiently
528.476	and endlessly. Thank you. (Applause)
