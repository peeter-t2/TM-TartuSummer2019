16.526	In 2002, a group of treatment activists met
21.015	to discuss the early development of the airplane.
25.045	The Wright Brothers, in the beginning of the last century,
29.746	had for the first time managed
31.448	to make one of those devices fly.
34.02	They also had taken out numerous patents
37.283	on essential parts of the airplane.
39.259	They were not the only ones.
40.7	That was common practice in the industry,
44.284	and those who held patents on airplanes
46.576	were defending them fiercely
47.732	and suing competitors left and right.
51.154	This actually wasn't so great for the development of the aviation industry,
56.071	and this was at a time that in particular the U.S. government
59.377	was interested in ramping up
61.934	the production of military airplanes.
64.623	So there was a bit of a conflict there.
67.334	The U.S. government decided to take action,
70.573	and forced those patent holders
72.905	to make their patents available to share with others
77.066	to enable the production of airplanes.
82.575	So what has this
85.545	got to do with this?
89.565	In 2002, Nelson Otwoma, a Kenyan social scientist,
94.628	discovered he had HIV and needed access to treatment.
99.769	He was told that a cure did not exist.
104.004	AIDS, he heard, was lethal,
107.207	and treatment was not offered. This was at a time
110.4	that treatment actually existed in rich countries.
113.168	AIDS had become a chronic disease.
116.163	People in our countries here in Europe, in North America,
119.764	were living with HIV, healthy lives.
122.709	Not so for Nelson. He wasn't rich enough,
125.544	and not so for his three-year-old son, who he discovered a year later
129.516	also had HIV.
132.756	Nelson decided to become a treatment activist
136.176	and join up with other groups.
138.305	In 2002, they were facing a different battle.
144.648	Prices for ARVs, the drugs needed to treat HIV,
149.363	cost about 12,000 [dollars] per patient per year.
153.76	The patents on those drugs were held
156.285	by a number of Western pharmaceutical companies
162.056	that were not necessarily willing
164.977	to make those patents available.
168.218	When you have a patent, you can exclude
170.39	anyone else from making, from producing or making
175.119	low-cost versions, for example,
178.117	available of those medications.
181.693	Clearly this led to patent wars breaking out
185.954	all over the globe.
188.912	Luckily, those patents did not exist everywhere.
192.573	There were countries that did not recognize
194.965	pharmaceutical product patents, such as India,
197.884	and Indian pharmaceutical companies
200.405	started to produce so-called generic versions,
204.364	low-cost copies of antiretroviral medicines,
208.831	and make them available in the developing world,
212.128	and within a year the price had come down
214.844	from 10,000 dollars per patient per year
218.63	to 350 dollars per patient per year,
221.132	and today that same triple pill cocktail
224.648	is available for 60 dollars per patient per year,
227.484	and of course that started to have an enormous effect
230.848	on the number of people who could afford access
233.937	to those medicines.
235.427	Treatment programs became possible,
238.005	funding became available, and the number of people
241.119	on antiretroviral drugs started to increase very rapidly.
247.88	Today, eight million people
250.593	have access to antiretroviral drugs.
253.709	Thirty-four million are infected with HIV.
257.691	Never has this number been so high,
259.69	but actually this is good news,
260.932	because what it means is people stop dying.
263.565	People who have access to these drugs stop dying.
265.885	And there's something else.
267.221	They also stop passing on the virus.
270.005	This is fairly recent science that has shown that.
273.667	What that means is we have the tools
276.323	to break the back of this epidemic.
280.08	So what's the problem?
285.349	Well, things have changed.
287.215	First of all, the rules have changed.
291.043	Today, all countries are obliged to provide
296.974	patents for pharmaceuticals that last at least 20 years.
301.496	This is as a result of the intellectual property rules
304.432	of the World Trade Organization.
306.78	So what India did is no longer possible.
309.959	Second, the practice of patent-holding companies have changed.
315.296	Here you see the patent practices
319.68	before the World Trade Organization's rules, before '95,
323.769	before antiretroviral drugs.
326.154	This is what you see today,
328.854	and this is in developing countries, so what that means is,
331.542	unless we do something deliberate
333.965	and unless we do something now,
336.348	we will very soon be faced with another drug price crisis,
341.464	because new drugs are developed,
343.684	new drugs go to market, but these medicines are patented
347.046	in a much wider range of countries.
350.115	So unless we act, unless we do something today,
354.752	we will soon be faced [with] what some have termed
358.684	the treatment time bomb.
361.728	It isn't only the number of drugs that are patented.
366.587	There's something else that can really scare
369.37	generic manufacturers away.
371.211	This shows you a patent landscape.
375.212	This is the landscape of one medicine.
378.896	So you can imagine that if you are a generic company
381.497	about to decide whether to invest
383.49	in the development of this product, unless you know
386.626	that the licenses to these patents
389.129	are actually going to be available,
391.627	you will probably choose to do something else.
394.679	Again, deliberate action is needed.
398.612	So surely
401.009	if a patent pool could be established
404.936	to ramp up the production of military airplanes,
408.997	we should be able to do something similar
412.531	to tackle the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
416.238	And we did.
418.301	In 2010, UNITAID established the Medicines Patent Pool
423.69	for HIV.
427.173	And this is how it works:
428.802	Patent holders, inventors
432.473	that develop new medicines
436.318	patent those inventions,
438.884	but make those patents available
440.635	to the Medicines Patent Pool. The Medicines Patent Pool
443.608	then license those out to whoever needs access to those patents.
447.423	That can be generic manufacturers.
449.099	It can also be not-for-profit drug development agencies,
452.912	for example.
454.389	Those manufacturers can then sell those medicines
456.903	at much lower cost to people who need access to them,
461.952	to treatment programs that need access to them.
464.524	They pay royalties over the sales to the patent holders,
468.7	so they are remunerated for sharing their intellectual property.
479.029	There is one key difference
483.087	with the airplane patent pool.
486.447	The Medicines Patent Pool is a voluntary mechanism.
491.364	The airplane patent holders were not left a choice
494.796	whether they'd license their patents or not.
496.436	They were forced to do so.
498.64	That is something that the Medicines Patent Pool cannot do.
502.562	It relies on the willingness of pharmaceutical companies
505.914	to license their patents and make them available
509.484	for others to use.
514.024	Today, Nelson Otwoma is healthy.
519.189	He has access to antiretroviral drugs.
523.171	His son will soon be 14 years old.
526.948	Nelson is a member of the expert advisory group
529.518	of the Medicines Patent Pool,
531.977	and he told me not so long ago,
534.078	"""Ellen, we rely in Kenya and in many other countries"
539.619	on the Medicines Patent Pool to make sure
543.018	that new medicines also become available to us,
548.53	"that new medicines, without delay, become available to us."""
553.919	And this is no longer fantasy.
557.278	Already, I'll give you an example.
561.757	In August of this year, the United States drug agency
565.215	approved a new four-in-one AIDS medication.
569.164	The company, Gilead, that holds the patents,
571.869	has licensed the intellectual property to the Medicines Patent Pool.
576.105	The pool is already working today, two months later,
580.032	with generic manufacturers to make sure that this product
583.137	can go to market at low cost
586.286	where and when it is needed. This is unprecedented.
589.696	This has never been done before.
591.636	The rule is about a 10-year delay for a new product
595.355	to go to market in developing countries, if at all.
598.326	This has never been seen before.
602.359	Nelson's expectations are very high,
605.863	and quite rightly so. He and his son will need access
610.132	to the next generation of antiretrovirals
613.221	and the next, throughout their lifetime,
616.328	so that he and many others in Kenya and other countries
621.006	can continue to live healthy, active lives.
625.438	Now we count on the willingness of drug companies
628.658	to make that happen. We count on those companies
631.28	that understand that it is in the interest, not only in the interest
634.7	of the global good, but also in their own interest,
637.884	to move from conflict to collaboration,
643.598	and through the Medicines Patent Pool they can make that happen.
646.479	They can also choose not to do that,
649.875	but those that go down that road may end up
656.086	in a similar situation the Wright brothers ended up with
659.01	early last century, facing forcible measures
662.844	by government. So they'd better jump now.
668.026	Thank you. (Applause)
