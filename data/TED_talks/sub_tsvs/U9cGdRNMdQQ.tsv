16.006	When I was a child, I always
16.006	wanted to be a superhero.
18.736	I wanted to save the world
18.736	and make everyone happy.
22.196	But I knew that I'd need superpowers
22.196	to make my dreams come true.
26.013	So I used to embark
26.013	on these imaginary journeys
28.26	to find intergalactic objects
28.26	from planet Krypton,
31.773	which was a lot of fun,
31.773	but didn't yield much result.
35.321	When I grew up and realized
37.084	that science fiction was not
37.084	a good source for superpowers,
40.26	I decided instead to embark
40.26	on a journey of real science,
43.606	to find a more useful truth.
45.855	I started my journey in California,
48.26	with a UC Berkeley
51.529	that examined the photos
51.529	of students in an old yearbook,
55.26	and tried to measure their success
55.26	and well-being throughout their life.
59.826	By measuring the students' smiles,
61.898	researchers were able to predict
63.707	how fulfilling and long-lasting
63.707	a subject's marriage would be,
67.948	(Laughter)
69.034	how well she would score
69.034	on standardized tests of well-being,
72.979	and how inspiring she would be to others.
76.479	In another yearbook, I stumbled
76.479	upon Barry Obama's picture.
80.188	When I first saw his picture,
81.687	I thought that his superpowers
81.687	came from his super collar.
84.87	(Laughter)
85.974	But now I know it was all in his smile.
88.91	Another aha! moment came from a 2010
88.91	Wayne State University research project
94.29	that looked into pre-1950s
94.29	baseball cards of Major League players.
99.036	The researchers found
99.036	that the span of a player's smile
102.567	could actually predict
102.567	the span of his life.
105.948	Players who didn't smile in their pictures
108.26	lived an average of only 72.9 years,
111.26	where players with beaming smiles
113.865	lived an average of almost 80 years.
116.26	(Laughter)
118.675	The good news is that
118.675	we're actually born smiling.
121.818	Using 3D ultrasound technology,
123.827	we can now see that developing
123.827	babies appear to smile,
127.429	even in the womb.
129.27	When they're born,
129.27	babies continue to smile --
132.26	initially, mostly in their sleep.
134.26	And even blind babies smile
136.26	to the sound of the human voice.
139.641	Smiling is one of the most basic,
139.641	biologically uniform
142.26	expressions of all humans.
144.721	In studies conducted in Papua New Guinea,
146.809	Paul Ekman, the world's most renowned
146.809	researcher on facial expressions,
151.104	found that even members of the Fore tribe,
154.26	who were completely disconnected
154.26	from Western culture,
157.456	and also known for their
157.456	unusual cannibalism rituals,
160.743	(Laughter)
162.051	attributed smiles
162.051	to descriptions of situations
164.718	the same way you and I would.
167.201	So from Papua New Guinea
168.917	to Hollywood
172.115	all the way to modern art in Beijing,
175.551	we smile often,
176.98	and use smiles to express
176.98	joy and satisfaction.
180.9	How many people here in this room
180.9	smile more than 20 times per day?
184.543	Raise your hand if you do.
186.621	Oh, wow.
188.162	Outside of this room,
189.685	more than a third of us smile
189.685	more than 20 times per day,
193.019	whereas less than 14 percent of us
193.019	smile less than five.
197.582	In fact, those with the most amazing
197.582	superpowers are actually children,
203.229	who smile as many as 400 times per day.
207.091	Have you ever wondered
207.091	why being around children,
209.475	who smile so frequently,
209.475	makes you smile very often?
214.26	A recent study
214.26	at Uppsala University in Sweden
217.171	found that it's very difficult to frown
217.171	when looking at someone who smiles.
222.06	You ask why?
223.506	Because smiling
223.506	is evolutionarily contagious,
225.99	and it suppresses the control
225.99	we usually have on our facial muscles.
231.148	Mimicking a smile
231.148	and experiencing it physically
234.6	helps us understand whether
234.6	our smile is fake or real,
238.26	so we can understand
238.26	the emotional state of the smiler.
242.536	In a recent mimicking study
244.26	at the University
244.26	of Clermont-Ferrand in France,
247.26	subjects were asked to determine
247.26	whether a smile was real or fake
251.26	while holding a pencil in their mouth
251.26	to repress smiling muscles.
256.069	Without the pencil,
256.069	subjects were excellent judges,
258.997	but with the pencil in their mouth --
260.901	when they could not mimic
260.901	the smile they saw --
263.52	their judgment was impaired.
265.45	(Laughter)
267.26	In addition to theorizing on evolution
267.26	"in ""The Origin of Species,"""
270.609	Charles Darwin also wrote
270.609	the facial feedback response theory.
275.149	His theory states that the act of smiling
275.149	itself actually makes us feel better,
280.678	rather than smiling being
280.678	merely a result of feeling good.
284.694	In his study, Darwin actually cited
284.694	a French neurologist, Guillaume Duchenne,
289.284	who sent electric jolts to facial muscles
289.284	to induce and stimulate smiles.
294.664	Please, don't try this at home.
296.592	(Laughter)
298.846	In a related German study,
300.569	researchers used fMRI imaging
300.569	to measure brain activity
304.26	before and after injecting Botox
304.26	to suppress smiling muscles.
310.26	The finding supported Darwin's theory,
312.57	by showing that facial feedback
314.467	modifies the neural processing
314.467	of emotional content in the brain,
318.26	in a way that helps us
318.26	feel better when we smile.
322.94	Smiling stimulates
322.94	our brain reward mechanism
325.226	in a way that even chocolate --
326.774	a well-regarded pleasure inducer --
329.607	cannot match.
331.337	British researchers found that one smile
334.527	can generate the same level
334.527	of brain stimulation
337.26	as up to 2,000 bars of chocolate.
340.26	(Laughter)
342.932	Wait --
344.115	The same study found
344.115	that smiling is as stimulating
347.946	as receiving up to 16,000
347.946	pounds sterling in cash.
352.076	(Laughter)
353.101	That's like 25 grand a smile.
354.97	It's not bad.
356.703	And think about it this way:
360.885	quite a few kids out there feel
360.885	like Mark Zuckerberg every day.
364.33	(Laughter)
366.099	And unlike lots of chocolate,
367.712	lots of smiling can actually
367.712	make you healthier.
370.458	Smiling can help reduce the level
370.458	of stress-enhancing hormones
374.329	like cortisol, adrenaline and dopamine,
377.534	increase the level of mood-enhancing
377.534	hormones like endorphins,
381.252	and reduce overall blood pressure.
384.113	And if that's not enough,
385.787	smiling can actually make you
385.787	look good in the eyes of others.
389.469	A recent study at Penn State University
389.469	found that when you smile,
393.26	you don't only appear to be
393.26	more likable and courteous,
397.139	but you actually appear
397.139	to be more competent.
401.061	So whenever you want
401.061	to look great and competent,
403.459	reduce your stress
403.459	or improve your marriage,
406.26	or feel as if you just had a whole stack
406.26	of high-quality chocolate
410.172	without incurring the caloric cost,
412.26	or as if you found 25 grand in a pocket
412.26	of an old jacket you hadn't worn for ages,
418.117	or whenever you want
418.117	to tap into a superpower
421.655	that will help you and everyone around you
424.641	live a longer, healthier, happier life,
428.468	smile.
429.791	(Applause)
