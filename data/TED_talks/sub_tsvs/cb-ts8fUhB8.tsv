12.634	So if I was to ask you
15.17	what the connection between
16.584	a bottle of Tide detergent and sweat was,
19.856	you'd probably think
19.856	that's the easiest question
21.52	that you're going to be asked
21.52	in Edinburgh all week.
24.3	But if I was to say
24.3	that they're both examples
26.939	of alternative or new forms of currency
30.168	in a hyperconnected,
30.168	data-driven global economy,
33.706	you'd probably think
33.706	I was a little bit bonkers.
37.235	But trust me, I work in advertising.
39.802	(Laughter)
41.835	And I am going to tell you the answer,
43.894	but obviously after this short break.
46.504	So a more challenging question is one
48.413	that I was asked, actually,
48.413	by one of our writers
50.296	a couple of weeks ago,
50.296	and I didn't know the answer:
52.797	What's the world's best
52.797	performing currency?
55.037	It's actually Bitcoin.
56.947	Now, for those of you
56.947	who may not be familiar,
59.162	Bitcoin is a crypto-currency, a virtual
59.162	currency, synthetic currency.
62.62	It was founded in 2008
62.62	by this anonymous programmer
66.426	using a pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.
69.294	No one knows who or what he is.
71.665	He's almost like the Banksy
71.665	of the Internet.
73.926	And I'm probably not going
73.926	to do it proper service here,
77.034	but my interpretation
77.034	of how it works is that
79.201	Bitcoins are released
79.201	through this process of mining.
81.984	So there's a network
81.984	of computers that are challenged
84.532	to solve a very complex
84.532	mathematical problem
86.686	and the person that manages to solve
86.686	it first gets the Bitcoins.
89.952	And the Bitcoins are released,
90.938	they're put into a public
90.938	ledger called the Blockchain,
93.582	and then they float, so
93.582	they become a currency,
96.235	and completely decentralized,
96.235	that's the sort of
99.282	scary thing about this,
99.282	which is why it's so popular.
101.83	So it's not run
101.83	by the authorities or the state.
104.306	It's actually managed by the network.
106.383	And the reason that it's proved
106.383	very successful
108.646	is it's private, it's anonymous,
108.646	it's fast, and it's cheap.
112.064	And you do get to the point where
112.064	there's some wild fluctuations with Bitcoin.
115.856	So in one level it went
115.856	from something like 13 dollars
118.771	to 266, literally
118.771	in the space of four months,
121.363	and then crashed and lost half
121.363	of its value in six hours.
124.102	And it's currently around that kind of
128.416	But what it does show
128.416	is that it's sort of gaining ground,
131.212	it's gaining respectability.
132.139	You get services,
132.139	like Reddit and Wordpress
134.235	are actually accepting Bitcoin
134.235	as a payment currency now.
137.53	And that's showing you that people
139.473	are actually placing trust in technology,
142.024	and it's started to trump and disrupt
144.784	and interrogate traditional institutions
146.829	and how we think
146.829	about currencies and money.
149.568	And that's not surprising,
149.568	if you think about
151.016	the basket case that is the E.U.
152.936	I think there was a Gallup
152.936	survey out recently
155.151	that said something like, in America,
157.137	trust in banks is at an all-time
157.137	low, it's something like 21 percent.
160.911	And you can see here
160.911	some photographs from London
162.726	where Barclays sponsored
162.726	the city bike scheme,
164.941	and some activists have
164.941	done some nice piece
166.548	of guerrilla marketing here
166.548	and doctored the slogans.
169.496	"""Sub-prime pedaling."" ""Barclays"
169.496	"takes you for a ride."""
172.993	These are the more polite ones
172.993	I could share with you today.
176.696	But you get the gist, so
176.696	people have really started
179.149	to sort of lose faith in institutions.
181.672	There's a P.R. company called Edelman,
183.72	they do this very interesting
183.72	survey every year
185.983	precisely around trust
185.983	and what people are thinking.
189.178	And this is a global survey,
189.178	so these numbers are global.
191.92	And what's interesting
191.92	is that you can see that
194.183	hierarchy is having a bit of a wobble,
196.787	and it's all about heterarchical now,
198.573	so people trust people
198.573	like themselves more
201.137	than they trust corporations
201.137	and governments.
204.221	And if you look at these figures
204.221	for the more developed markets
206.404	like U.K., Germany, and so on,
206.404	they're actually much lower.
209.132	And I find that sort of scary.
210.143	People are actually
210.143	trusting businesspeople
212.215	more than they're trusting
212.215	governments and leaders.
215.644	So what's starting to happen,
215.644	if you think about money,
218.751	if you sort of boil money
218.751	down to an essence,
220.96	it is literally just an expression
220.96	of value, an agreed value.
225.022	So what's happening now,
225.022	in the digital age,
227.142	is that we can quantify value
227.142	in lots of different ways
229.884	and do it more easily,
231.501	and sometimes the way
231.501	that we quantify those values,
234.179	it makes it much easier
236.702	to create new forms and valid
236.702	forms of currency.
240.499	In that context, you can see
240.499	that networks like Bitcoin
243.555	suddenly start to make a bit more sense.
247.198	So if you think we're starting to question
250.242	and disrupt and interrogate
250.242	what money means,
252.832	what our relationship with it
252.832	is, what defines money,
255.939	then the ultimate extension of that is,
259.017	is there a reason
259.017	for the government to be in charge
261.87	of money anymore?
263.326	So obviously I'm looking at this
263.326	through a marketing prism,
266.16	so from a brand perspective,
267.83	brands literally stand or fall
267.83	on their reputations.
271.505	And if you think about it, reputation
271.505	has now become a currency.
273.832	You know, reputations are built on trust,
275.943	consistency, transparency.
278.493	So if you've actually decided
278.493	that you trust a brand,
281.041	you want a relationship, you
281.041	want to engage with the brand,
283.875	you're already kind of participating
283.875	in lots of new forms
286.734	of currency.
288.273	So you think about loyalty.
290.263	Loyalty essentially is a micro-economy.
292.326	You think about rewards
292.326	schemes, air miles.
295.561	The Economist said a few years ago that
297.71	there are actually more
297.71	unredeemed air miles in the world
301.9	than there are dollar
301.9	bills in circulation.
304.8	You know, when you are standing
304.8	in line in Starbucks,
	in Starbucks on any one day
310.058	are actually being made
310.058	with Starbucks Star points.
313.12	So that's a sort of Starbucks currency
314.954	staying within its ecosystem.
316.987	And what I find interesting is that Amazon
319.915	has recently launched Amazon coins.
322.995	So admittedly it's a currency at the moment
322.995	that's purely for the Kindle.
325.734	So you can buy apps and make
325.734	purchases within those apps,
328.922	but you think about Amazon,
330.319	you look at the trust
330.319	barometer that I showed you
332.677	where people are starting
332.677	to trust businesses,
335.615	especially businesses
335.615	that they believe in and trust
338.116	more than governments.
339.506	So suddenly, you start thinking,
341.008	well Amazon potentially could push this.
342.846	It could become a natural extension,
344.536	that as well as buying stuff --
346.037	take it out of the Kindle --
346.037	you could buy books, music,
348.728	real-life products, appliances
348.728	and goods and so on.
353.301	And suddenly you're getting
353.301	Amazon, as a brand,
355.729	is going head to head
355.729	with the Federal Reserve
357.346	in terms of how you want
357.346	to spend your money,
359.513	what money is, what constitutes money.
361.888	And I'll get you back
361.888	to Tide, the detergent now,
365.484	as I promised.
366.896	This is a fantastic article I came
366.896	across in New York Magazine,
369.229	where it was saying that drug
369.229	users across America
372.059	are actually purchasing drugs
374.235	with bottles of Tide detergent.
376.886	So they're going into convenience stores,
378.974	stealing Tide,
380.084	and a $20 bottle of Tide
382.278	is equal to 10 dollars
382.278	of crack cocaine or weed.
387.154	And what they're saying,
387.154	so some criminologists
389.417	have looked at this and they're
389.417	saying, well, okay,
391.822	Tide as a product sells at a premium.
393.648	It's 50 percent
393.648	above the category average.
395.765	It's infused with a very
395.765	complex cocktail of chemicals,
399.093	so it smells very luxurious
399.093	and very distinctive,
401.478	and, being a Procter and Gamble brand,
403.426	it's been supported by a lot
403.426	of mass media advertising.
407.026	So what they're saying is that drug
407.026	users are consumers too,
409.895	so they have this
409.895	in their neural pathways.
411.967	When they spot Tide, there's a shortcut.
413.896	They say, that is trust. I trust that.
413.896	That's quality.
416.653	So it becomes this unit of currency,
419.272	which the New York Magazine described
421.058	as a very oddly loyal crime
421.058	wave, brand-loyal crime wave,
424.555	and criminals are actually
424.555	"calling Tide ""liquid gold."""
427.908	Now, what I thought
427.908	was funny was the reaction
430.123	from the P&amp;G spokesperson.
431.467	They said, obviously tried
431.467	to dissociate themselves from drugs,
434.491	"but said, ""It reminds me of one thing"
436.897	and that's the value of the brand
436.897	"has stayed consistent."" (Laughter)"
440.938	Which backs up my point
440.938	and shows he didn't even
442.799	break a sweat when he said that.
444.636	So that brings me back
444.636	to the connection with sweat.
447.33	In Mexico, Nike has run
447.33	a campaign recently
449.669	called, literally, Bid Your Sweat.
451.443	So you think about,
452.832	these Nike shoes have got sensors in them,
454.566	or you're using a Nike FuelBand
456.067	that basically tracks
456.067	your movement, your energy,
458.748	your calorie consumption.
460.553	And what's happening here,
460.553	this is where you've actually
462.388	elected to join that Nike community.
462.388	You've bought into it.
465.418	They're not advertising
465.418	loud messages at you,
467.538	and that's where advertising
467.538	has started to shift now
469.736	is into things like services,
469.736	tools and applications.
472.39	So Nike is literally acting
472.39	as a well-being partner,
475.335	a health and fitness partner
475.335	and service provider.
478.22	So what happens with this
478.22	"is they're saying, ""Right,"
480.378	you have a data dashboard.
480.378	We know how far you've run,
482.974	how far you've moved, what your calorie
482.974	intake, all that sort of stuff.
485.743	What you can do is, the more you
485.743	run, the more points you get,
488.965	and we have an auction where
488.965	you can buy Nike stuff
491.943	but only by proving that you've actually
491.943	"used the product to do stuff."""
495.466	And you can't come into this.
495.466	This is purely
497.586	for the community that are sweating
499.309	using Nike products. You
499.309	can't buy stuff with pesos.
501.944	This is literally a closed
501.944	environment, a closed auction space.
506.942	In Africa, you know, airtime has become
510.343	literally a currency in its own right.
512.177	People are used to,
512.177	because mobile is king,
514.28	they're very, very used
514.28	to transferring money,
517.125	making payments via mobile.
519.103	And one of my favorite examples
519.103	from a brand perspective
521.794	going on is Vodafone, where, in Egypt,
523.739	lots of people make purchases in markets
526.448	and very small independent stores.
528.229	Loose change, small
528.229	change is a real problem,
530.655	and what tends to happen
530.655	is you buy a bunch of stuff,
533.203	you're due, say,
536.331	The shopkeepers tend to give
536.331	you things like an onion
538.971	or an aspirin, or a piece of gum,
540.471	because they don't have small change.
542.199	So when Vodafone came
542.199	in and saw this problem,
544.366	this consumer pain point, they created
545.817	some small change which they call Fakka,
547.891	which literally sits and is given
549.572	by the shopkeepers to people,
551.767	and it's credit that goes
551.767	straight onto their mobile phone.
554.601	So this currency becomes
554.601	credit, which again,
556.987	is really, really interesting.
558.455	And we did a survey
558.455	that backs up the fact that,
560.765	you know, 45 percent of people
562.411	in this very crucial
562.411	demographic in the U.S.
565.705	were saying that they're comfortable using
567.729	an independent or branded currency.
570.242	So that's getting really interesting here,
572.266	a really interesting dynamic going on.
574.156	And you think, corporations
575.681	should start taking their assets
575.681	and thinking of them
578.415	in a different way and trading them.
580.95	And you think, is it much of a leap?
583.41	It seems farfetched,
583.41	but when you think about it,
586.449	in America in 1860,
589.167	there were 1,600 corporations
589.167	issuing banknotes.
593.374	There were 8,000 kinds
593.374	of notes in America.
596.674	And the only thing that stopped that,
597.931	the government controlled
597.931	four percent of the supply,
600.539	and the only thing that stopped it
602.183	was the Civil War breaking out,
603.876	and the government suddenly wanted
603.876	to take control of the money.
606.948	So government, money, war,
606.948	nothing changes there, then.
610.59	So what I'm going to ask is, basically,
613.445	is history repeating itself?
615.84	Is technology making paper
615.84	money feel outmoded?
619.741	Are we decoupling money
619.741	from the government?
621.884	You know, you think about, brands
621.884	are starting to fill the gaps.
624.908	Corporations are filling gaps
624.908	that governments can't afford to fill.
628.139	So I think, you know,
628.139	will we be standing on stage
630.9	buying a coffee -- organic,
630.9	fair trade coffee -- next year
634.585	using TED florins or TED shillings?
637.366	Thank you very much.
639.053	(Applause)
641.253	Thank you. (Applause)
