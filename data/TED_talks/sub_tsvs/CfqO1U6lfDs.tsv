12.645	A herd of wildebeests, a shoal of fish,
15.196	a flock of birds.
16.825	Many animals gather in large groups
18.893	that are among the most wonderful spectacles
20.879	in the natural world.
22.597	But why do these groups form?
25.321	The common answers include things like
26.958	seeking safety in numbers or hunting in packs
29.924	or gathering to mate or breed,
32.42	and all of these explanations,
34.088	while often true,
35.325	make a huge assumption about animal behavior,
38.368	that the animals are in control of their own actions,
41.545	that they are in charge of their bodies.
43.796	And that is often not the case.
47.223	This is Artemia, a brine shrimp.
50.147	You probably know it better as a sea monkey.
52.911	It's small, and it typically lives alone,
54.906	but it can gather in these large red swarms
57.983	that span for meters,
60.23	and these form because of a parasite.
63.32	These shrimp are infected with a tapeworm.
66.006	A tapeworm is effectively a long, living gut
68.257	with genitals at one end and
68.257	a hooked mouth at the other.
71.145	As a freelance journalist, I sympathize.
73.68	(Laughter)
75.835	The tapeworm drains nutrients from Artemia's body,
78.743	but it also does other things.
80.82	It castrates them,
82.44	it changes their color from transparent to bright red,
87.158	it makes them live longer,
88.674	and as biologist Nicolas Rode has found,
91.031	it makes them swim in groups.
94.39	Why? Because the tapeworm,
94.39	like many other parasites,
97.842	has a complicated life cycle
99.423	involving many different hosts.
101.687	The shrimp are just one step on its journey.
104.091	Its ultimate destination is this,
106.703	the greater flamingo.
108.65	Only in a flamingo can the tapeworm reproduce,
111.675	so to get there, it manipulates its shrimp hosts
114.964	into forming these conspicuous colored swarms
118.055	that are easier for a flamingo to spot
120.772	and to devour,
122.331	and that is the secret of the Artemia swarm.
125.263	They aren't sociable through their own volition,
127.426	but because they are being controlled.
129.502	It's not safety in numbers.
131.196	It's actually the exact opposite.
133.055	The tapeworm hijacks their brains and their bodies,
136.096	turning them into vehicles
137.492	for getting itself into a flamingo.
141.459	And here is another example
142.889	of a parasitic manipulation.
145.415	This is a suicidal cricket.
148.391	This cricket swallowed the 
148.391	larvae of a Gordian worm,
151.695	or horsehair worm.
153.588	The worm grew to adult size within it,
155.744	but it needs to get into water in order to mate,
158.782	and it does that by releasing proteins
161	that addle the cricket's brain,
163.188	causing it to behave erratically.
165.352	When the cricket nears a body of water,
167.307	such as this swimming pool,
168.926	it jumps in and drowns,
171.183	and the worm wriggles out
172.908	of its suicidal corpse.
176.764	Crickets are really roomy. Who knew?
180.367	The tapeworm and the Gordian worm are not alone.
183.582	They are part of an entire cavalcade
185.302	of mind-controlling parasites,
187.379	of fungi, viruses, and worms and insects and more
191.328	that all specialize in subverting and overriding
193.901	the wills of their hosts.
196.11	Now, I first learned about this way of life
197.847	"through David Attenborough's ""Trials of Life"""
200.34	about 20 years ago,
202.062	and then later through a wonderful book called
203.764	"""Parasite Rex"" by my friend Carl Zimmer."
206.438	And I've been writing about
206.438	these creatures ever since.
208.581	Few topics in biology enthrall me more.
211.392	It's like the parasites have subverted my own brain.
215.098	Because after all, they are always compelling
217.709	and they are delightfully macabre.
218.997	When you write about parasites,
220.389	your lexicon swells with phrases like
222.473	"""devoured alive"" and ""bursts out of its body."""
225.519	(Laughter)
226.756	But there's more to it than that.
228.296	I'm a writer, and fellow writers in the audience
230.398	will know that we love stories.
233.107	Parasites invite us to resist the allure
235.5	of obvious stories.
237.35	Their world is one of plot twists
239.66	and unexpected explanations.
243.267	Why, for example,
244.763	does this caterpillar
246.941	start violently thrashing about
248.915	when another insect gets close to it
250.583	and those white cocoons that it seems
252.84	to be standing guard over?
254.278	Is it maybe protecting its siblings?
257.374	No.
258.823	This caterpillar was attacked
260.28	by a parasitic wasp which laid eggs inside it.
263.499	The eggs hatched and the young wasps
264.933	devoured the caterpillar alive
266.247	before bursting out of its body.
267.918	See what I mean?
270.193	Now, the caterpillar didn't die.
273.031	Some of the wasps seemed to stay behind
275.616	and controlled it into defending their siblings
278.953	which are metamorphosing
280.587	into adults within those cocoons.
282.607	This caterpillar is a head-banging 
282.607	zombie bodyguard
286.146	defending the offspring
287.447	of the creature that killed it.
289.669	(Applause)
293.535	We have a lot to get through. 
293.535	I only have 13 minutes. (Laughter)
297.83	Now, some of you are probably just
299.641	desperately clawing for some solace
301.859	in the idea that these things are oddities
304.119	of the natural world, that they are outliers,
306.05	and that point of view is understandable,
307.87	because by their nature, parasites are quite small
310.248	and they spend a lot of their time
311.588	inside the bodies of other things.
314.542	They're easy to overlook,
316.313	but that doesn't mean that they aren't important.
318.898	A few years back, a man called Kevin Lafferty
321.103	took a group of scientists
321.103	into three Californian estuaries
324.472	and they pretty much weighed and dissected
326.22	and recorded everything they could find,
328.215	and what they found
329.443	were parasites in extreme abundance.
332.659	Especially common were trematodes,
334.703	tiny worms that specialize in castrating their hosts
337.353	like this unfortunate snail.
339.899	Now, a single trematode is tiny, microscopic,
342.788	but collectively they weighed as much
344.587	as all the fish in the estuaries
346.773	and three to nine times more than all the birds.
350.48	And remember the Gordian worm that I showed you,
352.474	the cricket thing?
353.862	One Japanese scientist called Takuya Sato
356.415	found that in one stream,
358.111	these things drive so many crickets
360.082	and grasshoppers into the water
361.381	that the drowned insects
362.69	make up some 60 percent of the diet of local trout.
366.994	Manipulation is not an oddity.
369.928	It is a critical and common part
372.048	of the world around us,
373.939	and scientists have now found
375.46	hundreds of examples of such manipulators,
377.942	and more excitingly, they're starting to understand
380.379	exactly how these creatures control their hosts.
384.437	And this is one of my favorite examples.
386.961	This is Ampulex compressa,
389.418	the emerald cockroach wasp,
391.642	and it is a truth universally acknowledged
393.936	that an emerald cockroach wasp in possession
395.579	of some fertilized eggs
397.375	must be in want of a cockroach.
399.841	When she finds one,
401.041	she stabs it with a stinger
403.252	that is also a sense organ.
404.701	This discovery came out three weeks ago.
407.372	She stabs it with a stinger that is a sense organ
409.677	equipped with small sensory bumps
411.471	that allow her to feel the distinctive texture
414.026	of a roach's brain.
416.133	So like a person blindly rooting about in a bag,
419.174	she finds the brain, and she injects it with venom
421.651	into two very specific clusters of neurons.
425.852	Israeli scientists Frederic Libersat and Ram Gal
428.935	found that the venom is a
428.935	very specific chemical weapon.
432.66	It doesn't kill the roach, nor does it sedate it.
435.204	The roach could walk away
437.331	or fly or run if it chose to,
440.356	but it doesn't choose to,
442.231	because the venom nixes its motivation to walk,
445.611	and only that.
446.725	The wasp basically un-checks
446.725	the escape-from-danger box
450.431	in the roach's operating system,
452.271	allowing her to lead her helpless victim
455.504	back to her lair by its antennae
457.615	like a person walking a dog.
460.254	And once there, she lays an egg on it,
461.931	egg hatches, devoured alive, bursts out of body,
464.207	yadda yadda yadda, you know the drill.
466.396	(Laughter) (Applause)
469.626	Now I would argue that, once stung,
472.506	the cockroach isn't a roach anymore.
474.511	It's more of an extension of the wasp,
476.861	just like the cricket was an
476.861	extension of the Gordian worm.
479.719	These hosts won't get to survive or reproduce.
482.519	They have as much control over their own fates
484.318	as my car.
486.102	Once the parasites get in,
487.602	the hosts don't get a say.
490.167	Now humans, of course,
491.481	are no stranger to manipulation.
493.513	We take drugs to shift the chemistries of our brains
495.873	and to change our moods,
497.004	and what are arguments or advertising or big ideas
501.024	if not an attempt to influence someone else's mind?
504.727	But our attempts at doing this
506.254	are crude and blundering compared
508.032	to the fine-grained specificity of the parasites.
511.127	Don Draper only wishes he was as elegant
513.519	and precise as the emerald cockroach wasp.
518.479	Now, I think this is part of what makes parasites
522.219	so sinister and so compelling.
525.005	We place such a premium on our free will
527.627	and our independence
528.888	that the prospect of losing those qualities
530.469	to forces unseen
531.747	informs many of our deepest societal fears.
534.915	Orwellian dystopias and shadowy cabals
537.368	and mind-controlling supervillains --
539.222	these are tropes that fill our darkest fiction,
542.25	but in nature, they happen all the time.
547.048	Which leads me to an obvious
549.68	and disquieting question:
551.98	Are there dark, sinister parasites
553.703	that are influencing our behavior
555.659	without us knowing about it,
557.234	besides the NSA?
560.053	If there are any —
561.36	(Laughter) (Applause)
565.326	I've got a red dot on my forehead now, don't I?
567.648	(Laughter)
570.175	If there are any, this is a good candidate for them.
573.129	This is Toxoplasma gondii, or Toxo, for short,
576.407	because the terrifying creature
577.996	always deserves a cute nickname.
580.206	Toxo infects mammals,
582.488	a wide variety of mammals,
583.966	but it can only sexually reproduce in a cat.
587.047	And scientists like Joanne Webster have shown that
589.808	if Toxo gets into a rat or a mouse,
592.001	it turns the rodent into a cat-seeking missile.
595.473	If the infected rat smells the delightful odor
598.549	of cat piss,
599.773	it runs towards the source of the smell
602.493	rather than the more sensible direction of away.
606.412	The cat eats the rat. Toxo gets to have sex.
608.947	It's a classic tale of Eat, Prey, Love.
611.819	(Laughter) (Applause)
619.512	You're very charitable, generous people.
622.714	Hi, Elizabeth, I loved your talk.
625.299	How does the parasite control its host
628.667	in this way?
629.871	We don't really know.
631.197	We know that Toxo releases an enzyme
632.885	that makes dopamine, a substance involved
634.877	in reward and motivation.
636.69	We know it targets certain parts of a rodent's brain,
639.121	including those involved in sexual arousal.
641.586	But how those puzzle pieces fit together
643.787	is not immediately clear.
645.631	What is clear is that this thing
647.927	is a single cell.
649.319	This has no nervous system.
650.689	It has no consciousness.
651.821	It doesn't even have a body.
653.122	But it's manipulating a mammal?
655.746	We are mammals.
657.172	We are more intelligent than a mere rat, to be sure,
659.606	but our brains have the same basic structure,
662.13	the same types of cells,
663.523	the same chemicals running through them,
665.111	and the same parasites.
667.43	Estimates vary a lot, but some figures suggest
669.778	that one in three people around the world
672.138	have Toxo in their brains.
673.851	Now typically, this doesn't lead to any overt illness.
677.339	The parasite holds up in a dormant state
679.217	for a long period of time.
681.4	But there's some evidence that those people
683.439	who are carriers score slightly differently
686.473	on personality questionnaires than other people,
689.202	that they have a slightly 
689.202	higher risk of car accidents,
691.686	and there's some evidence
691.686	that people with schizophrenia
694.289	are more likely to be infected.
696.835	Now, I think this evidence is still inconclusive,
699.018	and even among Toxo researchers,
700.929	opinion is divided as to whether the parasite
703.369	is truly influencing our behavior.
705.754	But given the widespread
705.754	nature of such manipulations,
708.413	it would be completely implausible
710.258	for humans to be the only species
711.907	that weren't similarly affected.
714.853	And I think that this capacity to constantly
719.246	subvert our way of thinking about the world
722.113	makes parasites amazing.
723.66	They're constantly inviting us to
723.66	look at the natural world sideways,
726.869	and to ask if the behaviors we're seeing,
729.04	whether they're simple and obvious
730.527	or baffling and puzzling,
732.06	are not the results of individuals
734.146	acting through their own accord
735.999	but because they are being bent
737.808	to the control of something else.
740.478	And while that idea may be disquieting,
742.518	and while parasites' habits may be very grisly,
745.441	I think that ability to surprise us
747.233	makes them as wonderful and as charismatic
750.408	as any panda or butterfly or dolphin.
753.772	"At the end of ""On the Origin of Species,"""
755.991	Charles Darwin writes about the grandeur of life,
758.98	and of endless forms most beautiful
761.633	and most wonderful,
763.065	and I like to think he could easily have been talking
765.644	about a tapeworm that makes shrimp sociable
768.824	or a wasp that takes cockroaches for walks.
772.073	But perhaps, that's just a parasite talking.
775.222	Thank you.
776.953	(Applause)
