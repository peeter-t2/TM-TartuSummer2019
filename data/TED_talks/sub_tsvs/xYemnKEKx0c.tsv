16.207	The story starts:
16.207	I was at a friend's house,
19.602	and she had on her shelf
19.602	a copy of the DSM manual,
23.664	which is the manual of mental disorders.
25.9	It lists every known mental disorder.
29.194	And it used to be, back in the '50s,
29.194	a very slim pamphlet.
32.251	And then it got bigger
32.251	and bigger and bigger,
34.9	and now it's 886 pages long.
38.006	And it lists currently
42.708	So I was leafing through it,
44.116	wondering if I had any mental disorders,
47.057	and it turns out I've got 12.
48.742	(Laughter)
49.917	I've got generalized anxiety disorder,
52.639	which is a given.
53.909	I've got nightmare disorder,
55.949	which is categorized
57.338	if you have recurrent dreams of being
57.338	pursued or declared a failure,
61.402	and all my dreams involve people
61.402	chasing me down the street
65.101	"going, ""You're a failure!"""
66.749	(Laughter)
68.556	I've got parent-child relational problems,
71.682	which I blame my parents for.
73.651	(Laughter)
75.57	I'm kidding. I'm not kidding.
77.952	I'm kidding.
79.888	And I've got malingering.
81.148	And I think it's actually quite rare
82.908	to have both malingering
82.908	and generalized anxiety disorder,
85.948	because malingering tends
85.948	to make me feel very anxious.
88.683	Anyway, I was looking through this book,
90.695	wondering if I was much crazier
90.695	than I thought I was,
93.32	or maybe it's not a good idea to diagnose
93.32	yourself with a mental disorder
96.877	if you're not a trained professional,
99.027	or maybe the psychiatry profession
99.027	has a kind of strange desire
103.924	to label what's essentially normal
103.924	human behavior as a mental disorder.
108.314	I didn't know which of these was true,
108.314	but I thought it was kind of interesting,
112.116	and I thought maybe I should
112.116	meet a critic of psychiatry
115	to get their view,
116.408	which is how I ended up having
116.408	lunch with the Scientologists.
119.77	(Laughter)
121.03	It was a man called Brian,
121.03	who runs a crack team of Scientologists
125.552	who are determined to destroy
125.552	psychiatry wherever it lies.
129.844	They're called the CCHR.
131.857	"And I said to him, ""Can you prove to me"
134.832	that psychiatry is a pseudo-science
134.832	"that can't be trusted?"""
138.912	"And he said, ""Yes,"
138.912	"we can prove it to you."""
141.123	"And I said, ""How?"""
142.56	"And he said, ""We're going"
142.56	"to introduce you to Tony."""
146.353	"And I said, ""Who's Tony?"""
148.234	"And he said, ""Tony's in Broadmoor."""
151.567	Now, Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital.
153.901	It used to be known as the Broadmoor
153.901	Asylum for the Criminally Insane.
158.559	It's where they send the serial killers,
161.019	and the people who can't help themselves.
163.099	And I said to Brian,
163.099	"""Well, what did Tony do?"""
166.28	"And he said, ""Hardly anything."
169.428	He beat someone up or something,
172.39	and he decided to fake madness
172.39	to get out of a prison sentence.
177.509	But he faked it too well,
177.509	and now he's stuck in Broadmoor
182.046	and nobody will believe he's sane.
184.531	Do you want us to try and get you
184.531	"into Broadmoor to meet Tony?"""
188.292	"So I said, ""Yes, please."""
190.646	So I got the train to Broadmoor.
192.194	I began to yawn uncontrollably
192.194	around Kempton Park,
196.313	which apparently is what dogs
196.313	also do when anxious,
198.719	they yawn uncontrollably.
200.996	And we got to Broadmoor.
202.718	And I got taken through gate
202.718	after gate after gate after gate
207.195	into the wellness center, which is where
207.195	you get to meet the patients.
210.716	It looks like a giant Hampton Inn.
214.178	It's all peach and pine
214.178	and calming colors.
218.113	And the only bold colors
218.113	are the reds of the panic buttons.
224.327	And the patients started drifting in.
227.408	And they were quite overweight
227.408	and wearing sweatpants,
231.013	and quite docile-looking.
232.696	And Brian the Scientologist
232.696	whispered to me,
235.459	"""They're medicated,"""
237.393	which, to the Scientologists,
237.393	is like the worst evil in the world,
240.636	but I'm thinking
240.636	it's probably a good idea.
243.241	(Laughter)
245.356	"And then Brian said, ""Here's Tony."""
248.419	And a man was walking in.
250.425	And he wasn't overweight,
250.425	he was in very good physical shape.
253.553	And he wasn't wearing sweatpants,
255.88	he was wearing a pinstripe suit.
258.294	And he had his arm outstretched
260.314	like someone out of The Apprentice.
262.398	He looked like a man
262.398	who wanted to wear an outfit
265.704	that would convince me
265.704	that he was very sane.
270.263	And he sat down.
271.438	"And I said, ""So is it true"
271.438	"that you faked your way in here?"""
274.763	"And he said, ""Yep. Yep. Absolutely."
274.763	I beat someone up when I was 17.
278.231	And I was in prison awaiting trial,
280.337	and my cellmate said to me,
281.676	'You know what you have to do?
283.184	Fake madness.
285.172	Tell them you're mad, you'll get
285.172	sent to some cushy hospital.
288.807	Nurses will bring you pizzas,
288.807	"you'll have your own PlayStation.'"""
292.662	"I said, ""Well, how did you do it?"""
294.378	"He said, ""Well, I asked to see"
294.378	the prison psychiatrist.
297.145	And I'd just seen a film called 'Crash,'
299.456	in which people get sexual pleasure
299.456	from crashing cars into walls.
303.583	So I said to the psychiatrist,
305.556	'I get sexual pleasure
305.556	"from crashing cars into walls.'"""
309.345	"And I said, ""What else?"""
310.794	"He said, ""Oh, yeah."
310.794	I told the psychiatrist
313.471	that I wanted to watch women as they died,
316.779	because it would make
316.779	"me feel more normal."""
318.968	"I said, ""Where'd you get that from?"""
320.714	"He said, ""Oh, from a biography"
320.714	of Ted Bundy that they had
323.522	"at the prison library."""
325.749	Anyway, he faked madness
325.749	too well, he said.
329	And they didn't send him
329	to some cushy hospital.
331.494	They sent him to Broadmoor.
333.799	And the minute he got there,
335.16	said he took one look at the place,
335.16	asked to see the psychiatrist,
338.29	"said, ""There's been"
338.29	a terrible misunderstanding.
340.832	"I'm not mentally ill."""
343.032	"I said, ""How long have you been here for?"""
345.322	"He said, ""Well, if I'd just"
345.322	done my time in prison
347.692	for the original crime,
347.692	I'd have got five years.
350.832	"I've been in Broadmoor for 12 years."""
356.171	Tony said that it's a lot harder
356.171	to convince people you're sane
360.224	than it is to convince them you're crazy.
362.732	"He said, ""I thought"
362.732	the best way to seem normal
364.979	would be to talk to people
364.979	normally about normal things
367.623	like football or what's on TV.
369.525	I subscribe to New Scientist,
371.287	and recently they had an article
372.978	about how the U.S. Army was training
372.978	bumblebees to sniff out explosives.
377.362	So I said to a nurse,
378.805	'Did you know that the U.S. Army
378.805	is training bumblebees
381.428	to sniff out explosives?'
383.847	When I read my medical notes,
383.847	I saw they'd written:
386.646	"'Believes bees can sniff out explosives.'"""
389.682	(Laughter)
391.26	"He said, ""You know, they're always"
391.26	looking out for nonverbal clues
394.391	to my mental state.
396.155	But how do you sit in a sane way?
398.816	How do you cross your legs in a sane way?
401.112	"It's just impossible."""
402.936	When Tony said that to me,
404.217	I thought to myself,
404.217	"""Am I sitting like a journalist?"
408.107	"Am I crossing my legs like a journalist?"""
411.332	"He said, ""You know, I've got"
411.332	the Stockwell Strangler on one side of me,
416.428	and I've got the 'Tiptoe
416.428	Through the Tulips' rapist
418.841	on the other side of me.
420.232	So I tend to stay in my room a lot
420.232	because I find them quite frightening.
423.705	And they take that as a sign of madness.
425.99	They say it proves
425.99	"that I'm aloof and grandiose."""
429.953	So, only in Broadmoor would not wanting
429.953	to hang out with serial killers
433.773	be a sign of madness.
435.384	Anyway, he seemed completely normal
435.384	to me, but what did I know?
439.174	And when I got home I emailed
439.174	his clinician, Anthony Maden.
442.018	"I said, ""What's the story?"""
443.616	"And he said, ""Yep."
443.616	We accept that Tony faked madness
447.151	to get out of a prison sentence,
447.151	because his hallucinations --
450.941	that had seemed
450.941	quite cliche to begin with --
453.116	just vanished the minute
453.116	he got to Broadmoor.
455.758	However, we have assessed him,
457.987	and we've determined that what he is
460.424	"is a psychopath."""
462.243	And in fact, faking madness
464.075	is exactly the kind of cunning
464.075	and manipulative act of a psychopath.
468.465	It's on the checklist:
468.465	cunning, manipulative.
471.41	So, faking your brain going wrong
473.011	is evidence that your brain
473.011	has gone wrong.
476.267	And I spoke to other experts,
477.863	and they said the pinstripe
477.863	suit -- classic psychopath --
481.826	speaks to items one
481.826	and two on the checklist:
484.128	glibness, superficial charm
484.128	and grandiose sense of self-worth.
487.969	"And I said, ""Well, but why didn't"
487.969	"he hang out with the other patients?"""
491.605	Classic psychopath -- it speaks
491.605	to grandiosity and also lack of empathy.
495.978	So all the things that had seemed
495.978	most normal about Tony
499.466	was evidence, according to his clinician,
502.515	that he was mad in this new way.
504.69	He was a psychopath.
506.117	"And his clinician said to me, ""If you"
506.117	want to know more about psychopaths,
509.666	you can go on a psychopath-spotting course
512.895	run by Robert Hare, who invented
512.895	"the psychopath checklist."""
515.806	So I did.
516.99	I went on a psychopath-spotting course,
519.057	and I am now a certified --
523.258	and I have to say, extremely adept --
523.258	psychopath spotter.
528.194	So, here's the statistics:
531.463	One in a hundred regular people
531.463	is a psychopath.
536.255	So there's 1,500 people in his room.
540.112	Fifteen of you are psychopaths.
545.091	Although that figure rises to four percent
545.091	of CEOs and business leaders,
550.097	so I think there's a very good chance
552.856	there's about 30 or 40
552.856	psychopaths in this room.
557.994	It could be carnage
557.994	by the end of the night.
560.452	(Laughter)
564.932	Hare said the reason why
564.932	is because capitalism at its most ruthless
569.852	rewards psychopathic behavior --
572.52	the lack of empathy, the glibness,
577.481	cunning, manipulative.
579.863	In fact, capitalism, perhaps
579.863	at its most remorseless,
582.852	is a physical manifestation
582.852	of psychopathy.
587.377	It's like a form of psychopathy
587.377	that's come down to affect us all.
592.567	"Hare said, ""You know what?"
592.567	Forget about some guy at Broadmoor
595.462	who may or may not have faked madness.
597.301	Who cares? That's not a big story.
598.946	"The big story,"" he said,"
598.946	"""is corporate psychopathy."
601.863	You want to go and interview yourself
601.863	"some corporate psychopaths."""
606.216	So I gave it a try.
606.216	I wrote to the Enron people.
609.423	"I said, ""Could I come"
609.423	and interview you in prison,
611.793	"to find out it you're psychopaths?"""
613.587	(Laughter)
614.841	And they didn't reply.
616.141	(Laughter)
617.715	So I changed tack.
619.636	"I emailed ""Chainsaw Al"" Dunlap,"
622.936	the asset stripper from the 1990s.
626.499	He would come into failing businesses
628.73	and close down 30 percent
628.73	of the workforce,
630.789	just turn American towns into ghost towns.
633.957	And I emailed him and I said,
635.434	"""I believe you may have"
635.434	a very special brain anomaly
638.252	that makes you ... special,
640.287	and interested in the predatory
640.287	spirit, and fearless.
644.672	Can I come and interview you
644.672	"about your special brain anomaly?"""
648.148	"And he said, ""Come on over!"""
649.99	(Laughter)
651.375	So I went to Al Dunlap's
651.375	grand Florida mansion.
654.451	It was filled with sculptures
654.451	of predatory animals.
659.522	There were lions and tigers --
659.522	he was taking me through the garden --
663.185	there were falcons and eagles,
665.901	"he was saying, ""Over there"
665.901	"you've got sharks and --"""
668.429	he was saying this
668.429	in a less effeminate way --
670.666	"""You've got more sharks"
670.666	"and you've got tigers."""
676.366	It was like Narnia.
678.09	(Laughter)
681.592	And then we went into his kitchen.
684.032	Now, Al Dunlap would be brought in
684.032	to save failing companies,
688.208	he'd close down 30 percent
688.208	of the workforce.
690.655	And he'd quite often
690.655	fire people with a joke.
693.858	Like, for instance,
693.858	one famous story about him,
696.227	somebody came up to him and said,
696.227	"""I've just bought myself a new car."""
699.703	"And he said, ""Well,"
699.703	you may have a new car,
701.735	but I'll tell you what you
701.735	"don't have -- a job."""
706.802	So in his kitchen --
707.982	he was in there with his wife, Judy,
707.982	and his bodyguard, Sean --
710.964	"and I said, ""You know"
710.964	how I said in my email
713.044	that you might have a special brain
713.044	"anomaly that makes you special?"""
716.704	"He said, ""Yeah, it's an amazing"
716.704	theory, it's like Star Trek.
719.63	You're going where
719.63	"no man has gone before."""
721.866	"And I said, ""Well --"" (Clears throat)"
724.994	(Laughter)
726.347	Some psychologists might say
729.534	"that this makes you --"""
729.534	(Mumbles)
732.236	(Laughter)
733.887	"And he said, ""What?"""
736.101	"And I said, ""A psychopath."""
737.429	"And I said, ""I've got a list"
737.429	of psychopathic traits in my pocket.
741.832	"Can I go through them with you?"""
744.653	And he looked intrigued despite himself,
746.77	"and he said, ""Okay, go on."""
748.169	"And I said, ""Okay."
748.169	"Grandiose sense of self-worth."""
751.576	Which I have to say, would
751.576	have been hard for him to deny,
754.376	because he was standing
754.376	under a giant oil painting of himself.
757.784	(Laughter)
761.959	"He said, ""Well, you've"
761.959	"got to believe in you!"""
765.016	"And I said, ""Manipulative."""
767.928	"He said, ""That's leadership."""
769.645	(Laughter)
770.67	"And I said, ""Shallow affect,"
773.1	an inability to experience
773.1	"a range of emotions."""
775.396	"He said, ""Who wants to be weighed"
775.396	"down by some nonsense emotions?"""
779.026	So he was going down
779.026	the psychopath checklist,
781.221	basically turning it
781.221	"into ""Who Moved My Cheese?"""
784.446	(Laughter)
787.562	But I did notice something happening
787.562	to me the day I was with Al Dunlap.
791.006	Whenever he said anything to me
791.006	that was kind of normal --
793.927	"like he said ""no"" to juvenile delinquency,"
796.894	he said he got accepted into West Point,
798.824	and they don't let
798.824	delinquents in West Point.
801.703	"He said ""no"" to many short-term"
801.703	marital relationships.
804.443	He's only ever been married twice.
806.127	Admittedly, his first wife
806.127	cited in her divorce papers
809.098	that he once threatened her with a knife
811.562	and said he always wondered
811.562	what human flesh tasted like,
814.303	but people say stupid things to each other
816.369	in bad marriages
816.369	in the heat of an argument,
818.448	and his second marriage
818.448	has lasted 41 years.
821.493	So whenever he said anything to me
821.493	that just seemed kind of non-psychopathic,
825.215	I thought to myself, well I'm not
825.215	going to put that in my book.
828.868	And then I realized that
828.868	becoming a psychopath spotter
832.196	had kind of turned me
832.196	a little bit psychopathic.
835.696	Because I was desperate to shove him
835.696	"in a box marked ""Psychopath."""
840.664	I was desperate to define him
840.664	by his maddest edges.
845.398	And I realized, my God --
846.624	this is what I've been doing for 20 years.
848.651	It's what all journalists do.
850.297	We travel across the world
850.297	with our notepads in our hands,
853.781	and we wait for the gems.
856.242	And the gems are always
856.242	the outermost aspects
860.599	of our interviewee's personality.
862.252	And we stitch them together
862.252	like medieval monks,
865.75	and we leave the normal
865.75	stuff on the floor.
870.187	And you know, this is a country
870.187	that over-diagnoses
873.23	certain mental disorders hugely.
876.531	Childhood bipolar --
877.897	children as young as four
877.897	are being labeled bipolar
881.476	because they have temper tantrums,
883.93	which scores them high
883.93	on the bipolar checklist.
888.533	When I got back to London, Tony phoned me.
892.697	"He said, ""Why haven't you"
892.697	"been returning my calls?"""
895.494	"I said, ""Well, they say"
895.494	"that you're a psychopath."""
898.867	"And he said, ""I'm not a psychopath."""
900.845	"He said, ""You know what?"
902.028	One of the items on the checklist
902.028	is lack of remorse,
904.724	but another item on the checklist
904.724	is cunning, manipulative.
907.609	So when you say you feel
907.609	remorse for your crime,
909.999	they say, 'Typical of the psychopath
911.763	to cunningly say he feels
911.763	remorse when he doesn't.'
915.164	It's like witchcraft, they turn
915.164	"everything upside-down."""
919.581	"He said, ""I've got a tribunal coming up."
921.84	"Will you come to it?"""
924	So I said okay.
925.783	So I went to his tribunal.
928.195	And after 14 years
928.195	in Broadmoor, they let him go.
933.101	They decided that he shouldn't
933.101	be held indefinitely
935.93	because he scores high
935.93	on a checklist that might mean
939.644	that he would have a greater
939.644	than average chance of recidivism.
944.9	So they let him go.
946.414	And outside in the corridor he said to me,
948.459	"""You know what, Jon?"
950.101	"Everyone's a bit psychopathic."""
952.88	"He said, ""You are, I am."
952.88	"Well, obviously I am."""
957.276	"I said, ""What are you going to do now?"""
959.312	"He said, ""I'm going to go to Belgium."
961.519	There's a woman there that I fancy.
963.221	But she's married, so I'm going to have
963.221	"to get her split up from her husband."""
967.2	(Laughter)
971.335	Anyway, that was two years ago,
974.392	and that's where my book ended.
975.994	And for the last 20 months,
975.994	everything was fine.
981.26	Nothing bad happened.
982.645	He was living with a girl outside London.
984.808	He was, according
984.808	to Brian the Scientologist,
986.93	making up for lost time,
986.93	which I know sounds ominous,
989.98	but isn't necessarily ominous.
992.222	Unfortunately, after 20 months,
994.143	he did go back to jail for a month.
996.877	"He got into a ""fracas"""
996.877	in a bar, he called it.
1001.364	Ended up going to jail for a month,
1001.364	which I know is bad,
1004.029	but at least a month implies
1004.029	that whatever the fracas was,
1007.941	it wasn't too bad.
1010.329	And then he phoned me.
1013.062	And you know what, I think
1013.062	it's right that Tony is out.
1018.158	Because you shouldn't define
1018.158	people by their maddest edges.
1021.337	And what Tony is,
1021.337	is he's a semi-psychopath.
1025.592	He's a gray area in a world
1025.592	that doesn't like gray areas.
1031.056	But the gray areas
1031.056	are where you find the complexity.
1036.052	It's where you find the humanity,
1038.497	and it's where you find the truth.
1041.381	And Tony said to me,
1043.513	"""Jon, could I buy you a drink in a bar?"
1047.409	I just want to thank you
1047.409	"for everything you've done for me."""
1050.733	And I didn't go.
1052.934	What would you have done?
1055.761	Thank you.
1057.137	(Applause)
