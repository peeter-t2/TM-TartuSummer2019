12.986	On Mondays and Thursdays,
12.986	I learn how to die.
17.178	I call them my terminal days.
19.102	My wife Fernanda doesn't like the term,
21.936	but a lot of people in my family died
21.936	of melanoma cancer
26.738	and my parents and grandparents had it.
29.373	And I kept thinking, one day I could
29.373	be sitting in front of a doctor
32.657	who looks at my exams and says,
34.779	"""Ricardo, things don't look very good."
37.094	"You have six months or a year to live."""
39.773	And you start thinking about
39.773	what you would do with this time.
43.034	"And you say, ""I'm going to spend "
43.034	more time with the kids.
45.839	I'm going to visit these places,
47.423	I'm going to go up and down
47.423	mountains and places
49.916	and I'm going to do all the things
49.916	"I didn't do when I had the time."""
53.806	But of course, we all know
55.639	these are very bittersweet memories 
55.639	we're going to have.
58.623	It's very difficult to do.
59.946	You spend a good part of the time
59.946	crying, probably.
63.599	So I said, I'm going to do something else.
65.986	Every Monday and Thursday,
65.986	I'm going use my terminal days.
70.825	And I will do, during those days,
73.194	whatever it is I was going to do
73.194	if I had received that piece of news.
76.721	(Laughter)
78.094	When you think about --
80.128	(Applause)
84.293	when you think about the opposite of work,
86.77	we, many times, think it's leisure.
89.247	And you say, ah, I need 
89.247	some leisure time, and so forth.
92.314	But the fact is that,
92.314	leisure is a very busy thing.
95.851	You go play golf and tennis,
95.851	and you meet people,
98.25	and you're going for lunch,
98.25	and you're late for the movies.
101.362	It's a very crowded thing that we do.
103.41	The opposite of work is idleness.
107.53	But very few of us know
107.53	what to do with idleness.
109.945	When you look at the way
109.945	that we distribute our lives in general,
114.007	you realize that in the periods
114.007	in which we have a lot of money,
118.561	we have very little time.
120.558	And then when we finally have time,
120.558	we have neither the money nor the health.
125.585	So we started thinking about that
125.585	as a company for the last 30 years.
130.205	This is a complicated company
130.205	with thousands of employees,
133.376	hundreds of millions
133.376	of dollars of business
135.736	that makes rocket fuel propellent systems,
135.736	runs 4,000 ATMs in Brazil,
142.289	does income tax preparation
142.289	for dozens of thousands.
145.646	So this is not a simple business.
149.258	We looked at it and we said,
151.386	let's devolve to these people,
151.386	let's give these people a company
156.254	where we take away
156.254	all the boarding school aspects
158.634	of, this is when you arrive,
158.634	this is how you dress,
161.023	this is how you go to meetings,
161.023	this is what you say,
163.585	this is what you don't say,
164.906	and let's see what's left.
166.412	So we started this about 30 years ago,
168.242	and we started dealing
168.242	with this very issue.
170.767	And so we said, look, the retirement,
172.964	the whole issue of how 
172.964	we distribute our graph of life.
176.106	Instead of going mountain climbing
176.106	when you're 82,
179.263	why don't you do it next week?
181.436	And we'll do it like this,
182.791	we'll sell you back your Wednesdays
182.791	for 10 percent of your salary.
187.187	So now, if you were going to be 
187.187	a violinist, which you probably weren't,
191.44	you go and do this on Wednesday.
193.594	And what we found --
194.941	we thought, these are the older people
197.478	who are going to be really interested
197.478	in this program.
200.077	And the average age
200.077	of the first people who adhered
202.531	were 29, of course.
203.979	And so we started looking,
205.337	and we said, we have to do things
205.337	in a different way.
207.837	So we started saying things like,
209.608	why do we want to know
209.608	what time you came to work,
211.982	what time you left, etc.?
213.233	Can't we exchange this for a contract
215.587	for buying something from you,
215.587	some kind of work?
219.049	Why are we building these headquarters?
221.07	Is it not an ego issue
221.07	that we want to look solid
223.838	and big and important?
225.717	But we're dragging you two hours
225.717	across town because of it?
229.001	So we started asking questions one by one.
232.532	We'd say it like this:
233.925	One: How do we find people?
236.207	We'd go out and try
236.207	and recruit people and we'd say,
239.39	look, when you come to us,
240.943	we're not going to have
240.943	two or three interviews
243.165	and then you're going to be
243.165	married to us for life.
245.577	That's not how we do 
245.577	the rest of our lives.
247.727	So, come have your interviews.
249.832	Anyone who's interested
249.832	in interviewing, you will show up.
253.268	And then we'll see what happens
253.268	out of the intuition that rises from that,
257.261	instead of just filling out the little 
257.261	items of whether you're the right person.
261.303	And then, come back.
263.42	Spend an afternoon, spend a whole day,
263.42	talk to anybody you want.
266.481	Make sure we are the bride 
266.481	you thought we were
269.542	and not all the bullshit
269.542	we put into our own ads.
272.605	(Laughter)
274.681	Slowly we went to a process 
274.681	where we'd say things like,
278.377	we don't want anyone to be
278.377	a leader in the company
281.138	if they haven't been 
281.138	interviewed and approved
283.281	by their future subordinates.
286.132	Every six months, everyone gets 
286.132	evaluated, anonymously, as a leader.
291.588	And this determines whether they should
291.588	continue in that leadership position,
295.62	which is many times
295.62	situational, as you know.
298.41	And so if they don't have 70, 80 percent 
298.41	of a grade, they don't stay,
304.464	which is probably the reason why
304.464	I haven't been CEO for more than 10 years.
308.803	And over time, we started asking
308.803	other questions.
312.699	We said things like,
314.215	why can't people set their own salaries?
317.544	What do they need to know?
319.12	There's only three things 
319.12	you need to know:
321.183	how much people make inside the company,
323.518	how much people make somewhere
323.518	else in a similar business
326.387	and how much we make in general
326.387	to see whether we can afford it.
329.679	So let's give people these three
329.679	pieces of information.
332.264	So we started having, in the cafeteria,
334.272	a computer where you could go in 
334.272	and you could ask
336.773	what someone spent, 
336.773	how much someone makes,
338.97	what they make in benefits, 
338.97	what the company makes,
341.45	what the margins are, and so forth.
343.76	And this is 25 years ago.
347.452	As this information started 
347.452	coming to people,
350.187	we said things like, we don't want 
350.187	to see your expense report,
353.296	we don't want to know how many 
353.296	holidays you're taking,
355.892	we don't want to know where you work.
357.78	We had, at one point,
360.756	and we'd say, go to the one 
360.756	that's closest to your house,
364.15	to the customer that 
364.15	you're going to visit today.
366.651	Don't tell us where you are.
368.77	And more, even when we had
368.77	thousands of people, 5,000 people,
372.895	we had two people in the H.R. department,
376.273	and thankfully one of them has retired.
378.671	(Laughter)
380.63	And so, the question we were asking was,
380.63	how can we be taking care of people?
384.384	People are the only thing we have.
386.187	We can't have a department that runs
386.187	after people and looks after people.
389.625	So as we started finding that this worked,
389.625	and we'd say, we're looking for --
395.006	and this is, I think,
395.006	the main thing I was looking for
397.701	in the terminal days and in the company,
399.744	which is, how do you set up for wisdom?
403.313	We've come from an age of revolution,
403.313	industrial revolution,
407.989	an age of information,
407.989	an age of knowledge,
410.672	but we're not any closer
410.672	to the age of wisdom.
413.284	How we design, how do we organize,
413.284	for more wisdom?
416.611	So for example, many times,
418.154	what's the smartest or the intelligent
418.154	decision doesn't jive.
422.501	So we'd say things like,
424.883	let's agree that you're going to sell
428.89	If you sell them by Wednesday, 
428.89	please go to the beach.
432.563	Don't create a problem for us, 
432.563	for manufacturing, for application,
436.274	then we have to buy new companies,
436.274	we have to buy our competitors,
439.377	we have to do all kinds of things
439.377	because you sold too many widgets.
442.599	So go to the beach
442.599	and start again on Monday.
444.835	(Laughter) (Applause)
447.271	So the process is looking for wisdom.
450.61	And in the process, of course, 
450.61	we wanted people to know everything,
454.15	and we wanted to be truly democratic
454.15	about the way we ran things.
457.519	So our board had two seats open 
457.519	with the same voting rights,
463.21	for the first two people who showed up.
465.328	(Laughter)
466.896	And so we had cleaning ladies voting
466.896	on a board meeting,
472.132	which had a lot of other very important
472.132	people in suits and ties.
475.228	And the fact is that they kept us honest.
478.857	This process, as we started looking
478.857	at the people who came to us,
482.606	we'd say, now wait a second,
484.184	people come to us and they say,
484.184	where am I supposed to sit?
487.067	How am I supposed to work?
487.067	Where am I going to be in 5 years' time?
490.308	And we looked at that and we said,
490.308	we have to start much earlier.
493.386	Where do we start?
494.409	We said, oh, kindergarten 
494.409	seems like a good place.
496.924	So we set up a foundation, which now has, 
496.924	for 11 years, three schools,
501.581	where we started asking
501.581	the same questions,
503.883	how do you redesign school for wisdom?
506.795	It is one thing to say,
506.795	we need to recycle the teachers,
509.724	we need the directors to do more.
511.401	But the fact is that what we do
511.401	with education is entirely obsolete.
517.333	The teacher's role is entirely obsolete.
519.831	Going from a math class, to biology,
519.831	to 14th-century France is very silly.
525.482	(Applause)
530.184	So we started thinking, 
530.184	what could it look like?
532.913	And we put together people, 
532.913	including people who like education,
536.482	people like Paulo Freire, 
536.482	and two ministers of education in Brazil
541.917	and we said, if we were to design
541.917	a school from scratch,
544.586	what would it look like?
546.013	And so we created this school,
546.013	which is called Lumiar,
549.746	and Lumiar, one of them
549.746	is a public school,
551.898	and Lumiar says the following:
553.704	Let's divide this role
553.704	of the teacher into two.
557.881	One guy, we'll call a tutor.
560.242	A tutor, in the old sense of the Greek
560.242	"""paideia"": Look after the kid."
565.217	What's happening at home,
565.217	what's their moment in life, etc..
569.047	But please don't teach,
570.387	because the little you know compared 
570.387	to Google, we don't want to know.
573.797	Keep that to yourself.
574.949	(Laughter)
576.297	Now, we'll bring in people
576.297	who have two things:
580.25	passion and expertise, and it could be
580.25	their profession or not.
584.617	And we use the senior citizens,
586.534	who are 25 percent of the population
586.534	with wisdom that nobody wants anymore.
590.887	So we bring them to school and we say,
593.494	teach these kids whatever
593.494	you really believe in.
597.33	So we have violinists teaching math.
599.946	We have all kinds of things where we say,
602.511	don't worry about 
602.511	the course material anymore.
605.492	We have approximately 10 great threads
605.492	that go from 2 to 17.
610.456	Things like, how do we measure
610.456	ourselves as humans?
614.846	So there's a place for math and physics
614.846	and all that there.
618.472	How do we express ourselves?
620.336	So there's a place
620.336	for music and literature, etc.,
622.741	but also for grammar.
624.385	And then we have things
624.385	that everyone has forgotten,
627.042	which are probably the most 
627.042	important things in life.
629.611	The very important things in life,
629.611	we know nothing about.
633.309	We know nothing about love,
635.549	we know nothing about death,
637.641	we know nothing about why we're here.
639.718	So we need a thread in school that
639.718	talks about everything we don't know.
644.252	So that's a big part of what we do.
646.356	(Applause)
651.951	So over the years, we started going
651.951	into other things.
654.869	We'd say, why do we have to scold the kids
657.031	and say, sit down and come here 
657.031	and do that, and so forth.
659.822	We said, let's get the kids to do 
659.822	something we call a circle,
663.137	which meets once a week.
664.402	And we'd say, you put the rules together
666.712	and then you decide
666.712	what you want to do with it.
669.039	So can you all hit yourself on the head?
671.221	Sure, for a week, try.
673.543	They came up with the very same
673.543	rules that we had,
677.478	except they're theirs.
678.869	And then, they have the power,
681.114	which means, they can and do
681.114	suspend and expel kids
686.106	so that we're not playing school,
686.106	they really decide.
691.504	And then, in this same vein,
694.547	we keep a digital mosaic,
696.941	because this is not constructivist
696.941	or Montessori or something.
700.572	It's something where we keep
700.572	the Brazilian curriculum
704.11	with 600 tiles of a mosaic,
706.778	which we want to expose these kids
706.778	to by the time they're 17.
709.915	And follow this all the time
709.915	and we know how they're doing
712.75	and we say, you're not interested 
712.75	in this now, let's wait a year.
716.804	And the kids are in groups
716.804	that don't have an age category,
721.036	so the six-year-old kid
721.036	who is ready for that with an 11-year-old,
724.762	that eliminates all of the gangs
724.762	and the groups
727.127	and this stuff that we have 
727.127	in the schools, in general.
731.012	And they have a zero 
731.012	to 100 percent grading,
733.453	which they do themselves with an app
733.453	every couple of hours.
737.254	Until we know they're 37 percent of the
737.254	way we'd like them to be on this issue,
741.689	so that we can send them out in the world
741.689	with them knowing enough about it.
746.584	And so the courses are World Cup Soccer,
746.584	or building a bicycle.
751.827	And people will sign up for 
751.827	a 45-day course on building a bicycle.
756.098	Now, try to build a bicycle without 
756.098	knowing that pi is 3.1416.
760.667	You can't.
762.431	And try, any one of you, 
762.431	using 3.1416 for something.
767.083	You don't know anymore.
768.589	So this is lost and that's what 
768.589	we try to do there,
771.02	which is looking 
771.02	for wisdom in that school.
773.134	And that brings us back to this graph
773.134	and this distribution of our life.
779.09	I accumulated a lot of money 
779.09	when I think about it.
781.751	When you think and you say,
781.751	now is the time to give back --
785.998	well, if you're giving back, 
785.998	you took too much.
788.67	(Laughter) (Applause)
796.822	I keep thinking of Warren Buffet
796.822	waking up one day
799.402	and finding out he has 30 billion dollars
799.402	more than he thought he had.
802.786	And he looks and he says,
802.786	what am I going to do with this?
805.578	And he says, I'll give it to someone
805.578	who really needs this.
808.415	I'll give it to Bill Gates. (Laughter)
812.086	And my guy, who's my financial
812.086	advisor in New York,
815.236	he says, look, you're a silly guy
817.129	because you would have 4.1 times 
817.129	more money today
820.402	if you had made money with money
820.402	instead of sharing as you go.
824.668	But I like sharing as you go better.
826.48	(Applause)
829.786	I taught MBAs at MIT for a time
834.058	and I ended up, one day,
834.058	at the Mount Auburn Cemetery.
836.664	It is a beautiful cemetery in Cambridge.
838.608	And I was walking around.
838.608	It was my birthday and I was thinking.
841.65	And the first time around, 
841.65	I saw these tombstones
844.044	and these wonderful people 
844.044	who'd done great things
846.817	and I thought, what do I want 
846.817	to be remembered for?
850.889	And I did another stroll around,
852.485	and the second time,
852.485	another question came to me,
854.93	which did me better, which was,
857.233	why do I want to be remembered at all?
860.12	(Laughter)
862.257	And that, I think, 
862.257	took me different places.
865.078	When I was 50, my wife Fernanda and I
865.078	sat for a whole afternoon,
869.326	we had a big pit with fire,
871.508	and I threw everything I had ever 
871.508	done into that fire.
875.084	This is a book in 38 languages,
877.471	hundreds and hundreds of articles
877.471	and DVDs, everything there was.
881.018	And that did two things.
882.438	One, it freed our five kids
882.438	from following in our steps, our shadow --
887.363	They don't know what I do.
889.019	(Laughter)
890.243	Which is good.
891.552	And I'm not going to take them somewhere
893.477	and say, one day 
893.477	all of this will be yours.
895.871	(Laughter)
897.428	The five kids know nothing, which is good.
900.96	And the second thing is,
902.641	I freed myself from this anchor
902.641	of past achievement or whatever.
907.339	I'm free to start something new every time
907.339	and to decide things from scratch
911.837	in part of those terminal days.
913.958	And some people would say,
915.375	oh, so now you have this time,
915.375	these terminal days,
917.913	and so you go out and do everything.
919.771	No, we've been to the beaches,
922.093	so we've been to Samoa and Maldives
922.093	and Mozambique,
924.655	so that's done.
926.421	I've climbed mountains in the Himalayas.
928.53	I've gone down 60 meters to see 
928.53	hammerhead sharks.
932.401	I've spent 59 days on the back of a camel
932.401	from Chad to Timbuktu.
936.952	I've gone to the magnetic 
936.952	North Pole on a dog sled.
940.943	So, we've been busy.
942.719	It's what I'd like to call 
942.719	my empty bucket list.
948.722	(Laughter)
951.701	And with this rationale,
951.701	I look at these days and I think,
955.258	I'm not retired. 
955.258	I don't feel retired at all.
957.777	And so I'm writing a new book.
959.918	We started three new companies
959.918	in the last two years.
963.731	I'm now working on getting this 
963.731	school system for free out into the world,
968.934	and I've found, very interestingly enough,
968.934	that nobody wants it for free.
972.387	And so I've been trying for 10 years
974.325	to get the public system
974.325	to take over this school rationale,
977.75	much as the public schools we have,
980.145	which has instead of 43 out of 100,
980.145	as their rating, as their grades,
984.842	has 91 out of 100.
987.531	But for free, nobody wants it.
989.964	So maybe we'll start charging for it 
989.964	and then it will go somewhere.
993.158	But getting this out is one
993.158	of the things we want to do.
996.939	And I think what this leaves us
996.939	as a message for all of you,
1000.256	I think is a little bit like this:
1002.008	We've all learned
1002.008	how to go on Sunday night
1005.165	to email and work from home.
1007.582	But very few of us have learned
1009.292	how to go to the movies
1009.292	on Monday afternoon.
1012.422	And if we're looking for wisdom,
1012.422	we need to learn to do that as well.
1016.523	And so, what we've done all
1016.523	of these years is very simple,
1020.173	is use the little tool,
1020.173	which is ask three whys in a row.
1023.345	Because the first why
1023.345	you always have a good answer for.
1026.106	The second why,
1026.106	it starts getting difficult.
1028.521	By the third why, you don't really know
1028.521	why you're doing what you're doing.
1032.46	What I want to leave you with is the seed
1032.46	and the thought that maybe if you do this,
1038.688	you will come to the question, what for?
1041.444	What am I doing this for?
1042.946	And hopefully, as a result of that,
1042.946	and over time,
1045.827	I hope that with this,
1045.827	and that's what I'm wishing you,
1048.96	you'll have a much wiser future.
1051.663	Thank you very much.
1053.448	(Applause)
1065.957	Chris Anderson: So Ricardo, 
1065.957	you're kind of crazy.
1071.044	(Laughter)
1072.869	To many people, this seems crazy.
1076.049	And yet so deeply wise, also.
1079.438	The pieces I'm trying
1079.438	to put together are this:
1082.347	Your ideas are so radical.
1084.442	How, in business, for example,
1084.442	these ideas have been out for a while,
1090.191	probably the percentage of businesses 
1090.191	that have taken some of them
1093.401	is still quite low.
1095.303	Are there any times you've seen 
1095.303	some big company
1098.201	take on one of your ideas 
1098.201	"and you've gone, ""Yes!""?"
1101.83	Ricardo Semler: It happens.
1101.83	It happened about two weeks ago
1104.627	with Richard Branson,
1104.627	with his people saying,
1106.837	oh, I don't want to control
1106.837	your holidays anymore,
1109.369	or Netflix does a little bit
1109.369	of this and that,
1111.553	but I don't think it's very important.
1113.88	I'd like to see it happen maybe a little
1113.88	bit in a bit of a missionary zeal,
1117.634	but that's a very personal one.
1119.208	But the fact is that it takes a leap 
1119.208	of faith about losing control.
1123.42	And almost nobody who is in control
1123.42	is ready to take leaps of faith.
1126.716	It will have to come from kids 
1126.716	and other people
1129.056	who are starting companies 
1129.056	in a different way.
1131.298	CA: So that's the key thing?
1132.806	From your point of view
1132.806	the evidence is there,
1135.005	in the business point of view this works,
1137.001	but people just don't have
1137.001	the courage to -- (Whoosh)
1139.709	RS: They don't even have the incentive.
1141.831	You're running a company
1141.831	with a 90-day mandate.
1144.587	It's a quarterly report.
1146.466	If you're not good in 90 days, you're out.
1148.684	"So you say, ""Here's a great program that,"
1148.684	"in less than one generation --"""
1152.605	"And the guy says, ""Get out of here."""
1154.529	So this is the problem.
1156.42	(Laughter)
1159.335	CA: What you're trying to do in education
1159.335	seems to me incredibly profound.
1164.651	Everyone is bothered about
1164.651	their country's education system.
1169.149	No one thinks that
1169.149	we've caught up yet to a world
1171.922	where there's Google and all these 
1171.922	technological options.
1174.872	So you've got actual evidence now that 
1174.872	the kids so far going through your system,
1178.742	there's a dramatic increase 
1178.742	in performance.
1181.294	How do we help you move
1181.294	these ideas forward?
1183.859	RS: I think it's that problem
1183.859	of ideas whose time has come.
1188.75	And I've never been very evangelical
1188.75	about these things.
1192.252	We put it out there.
1193.793	Suddenly, you find people --
1195.238	there's a group in Japan, 
1195.238	which scares me very much,
1197.753	which is called the Semlerists,
1197.753	and they have 120 companies.
1200.918	They've invited me.
1200.918	I've always been scared to go.
1205.289	And there is a group in Holland
1205.289	that has 600 small, Dutch companies.
1210.464	It's something that
1210.464	will flourish on its own.
1213.141	Part of it will be wrong, 
1213.141	and it doesn't matter.
1215.632	This will find its own place.
1217.709	And I'm afraid
1217.709	of the other one, which says,
1220.194	this is so good you've got to do this.
1222.126	Let's set up a system 
1222.126	and put lots of money into it
1224.792	and then people will do it no matter what.
1227.319	CA: So you have asked 
1227.319	extraordinary questions your whole life.
1230.563	It seems to me that's the fuel 
1230.563	that's driven a lot of this.
1233.396	Do you have any other questions for us,
1233.396	for TED, for this group here?
1239.265	RS: I always come back 
1239.265	to variations of the question
1243.854	that my son asked me when he was three.
1247.105	We were sitting in a jacuzzi,
1247.105	"and he said, ""Dad, why do we exist?"""
1251.056	There is no other question.
1252.62	Nobody has any other question.
1254.134	We have variations of this one question,
1254.134	from three onwards.
1258.123	So when you spend time in a company,
1258.123	in a bureaucracy, in an organization
1263.519	and you're saying, boy --
1265.142	how many people do you know
1265.142	who on their death beds said,
1267.859	boy, I wish I had spent
1267.859	more time at the office?
1270.264	So there's a whole thing 
1270.264	of having the courage now --
1275.314	not in a week, not in two months,
1277.222	not when you find out 
1277.222	you have something --
1279.516	to say, no, what am I doing this for?
1282.388	Stop everything. Let me do something else.
1284.505	And it will be okay,
1286.07	it will be much better
1286.07	than what you're doing,
1288.341	if you're stuck in a process.
1291.449	CA: So that strikes me as a profound
1291.449	and quite beautiful way to end
1294.651	this penultimate day of TED.
1296.277	Ricardo Semler, thank you so much.
1297.955	RS: Thank you so much.
1299.532	(Applause)
