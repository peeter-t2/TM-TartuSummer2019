12.44	The word concussion evokes a fear
12.44	these days more so than it ever has,
17.12	and I know this personally.
19.52	I played 10 years of football,
22.2	was struck in the head thousands of times.
24.64	And I have to tell you, though,
24.64	what was much worse than that
28.32	was a pair of bike accidents I had
28.32	where I suffered concussions,
33.12	and I'm still dealing with the effects
33.12	of the most recent one
36.08	today as I stand in front of you.
39.64	There is a fear around concussion
42.12	that does have some evidence behind it.
45.6	There is information
45.6	that a repeated history of concussion
48.96	can lead to early dementia,
48.96	such as Alzheimer's,
52.28	and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.
54.36	That was the subject
54.36	"of the Will Smith movie ""Concussion."""
58.56	And so everybody is caught up in football
58.56	and what they see in the military,
62.16	but you may not know
63.52	that bike riding is the leading cause
63.52	of concussion for kids,
67.84	sports-related concussion, that is.
71.04	And so another thing
71.04	that I should tell you
73.64	that you may not know
74.88	is that the helmets that are worn
74.88	in bicycling and football
77.84	and many activities,
79.52	they're not designed or tested
82.12	for how well they can protect
82.12	your children against concussion.
86.2	They're in fact designed and tested
87.96	for their ability to protect
87.96	against skull fracture.
91.84	And so I get this question
91.84	all the time from parents,
97.48	and they ask me,
99.08	"""Would you let your own child"
99.08	"play football?"""
101.4	"Or, ""Should I let my child play soccer?"""
104.6	And I think that as a field,
107.52	we're a long way from giving an answer
107.52	with any kind of confidence there.
113.44	So I look at that question
113.44	from a bit of a different lens,
117.04	and I want to know,
117.04	how can we prevent concussion?
120.8	Is that even possible?
122.48	And most experts think that it's not,
126.52	but the work that we're doing in my lab
128.76	is starting to reveal more
128.76	of the details around concussion
133.16	so that we can have
133.16	a better understanding.
135.96	The reason we're able
135.96	to prevent skull fracture with helmets
138.84	is because it's pretty simple.
138.84	We know how it works.
141.32	Concussion has been
141.32	much more of a mystery.
144.28	So to give you a sense of what might
144.28	be happening in a concussion,
149.24	I want to show you the video here
151.2	that you see when you type into Google,
153.76	"""What is a concussion?"""
155.2	The CDC website comes up,
156.88	and this video essentially
156.88	tells the whole story.
160.36	What you see is the head moves forward,
162.8	the brain lags behind,
164.88	then the brain catches up
166.32	and smashes into the skull.
168.6	It rebounds off the skull
170.8	and then proceeds to run
170.8	into the other side of the skull.
175.32	And what you'll notice is highlighted
175.32	in this video from the CDC,
178.96	which I'll note was funded by the NFL,
181.44	is that the outer surface of the brain,
184.4	where it was to have
184.4	smashed into the skull,
187.72	looks like it's been damaged or injured,
187.72	so it's on the outer surface of the brain.
191.68	And what I'd like to do with this video
193.68	is to tell you that there are
193.68	some aspects that are probably right,
197.4	indicative of what the scientists
197.4	think happens with concussion,
200.44	but there's probably more
200.44	that's wrong with this video.
203.08	So one thing that I do agree with,
203.08	and I think most experts would,
206.36	is that the brain
206.36	does have these dynamics.
208.4	It does lag behind the skull
210.8	and then catch up and move
210.8	back and forth and oscillate.
213.48	That we think is true.
215.76	However, the amount of motion
215.76	you see in the brain in this video
219.08	is probably not right at all.
220.68	There's very little room
220.68	in the cranial vault,
224.12	only a few millimeters,
225.84	and it's filled entirely
225.84	with cerebral spinal fluid,
229.04	which acts as a protective layer.
231.24	And so the brain as a whole probably
231.24	moves very little inside the skull.
236.52	The other problem with this video
238.6	is that the brain is shown
240.36	as a kind of rigid whole
240.36	as it moves around,
243.48	and that's not true either.
245.72	Your brain is one of the softest
245.72	substances in your body,
249.16	and you can think of it
249.16	kind of like jello.
251.2	So as your head is moving back and forth,
253.36	your brain is twisting
253.36	and turning and contorting,
256.24	and the tissue is getting stretched.
258.48	And so most experts, I think, would agree
261.52	that concussion is not likely
261.52	to be something that's happening
264.68	on this outer surface of the brain,
266.52	but rather it's something
266.52	that's much deeper
268.64	towards the center of the brain.
271.279	Now, the way that we're
271.279	approaching this problem
273.88	to try to understand
273.88	the mechanisms of concussion
276.24	and to figure out if we can prevent it
278.12	is we are using a device like this.
280.96	It's a mouthguard.
282.96	It has sensors in it
282.96	that are essentially the same
285.88	that are in your cell phone:
287.24	accelerometers, gyroscopes,
289.6	and when someone is struck in the head,
291.52	it can tell you how their head moved
294.08	at a thousand samples per second.
298.76	The principle behind
298.76	the mouthguard is this:
301.48	it fits onto your teeth.
302.76	Your teeth are one of the hardest
302.76	substances in your body.
305.84	So it rigidly couples to your skull
307.92	and gives you the most precise
307.92	possible measurement
310.36	of how the skull moves.
312.32	People have tried
312.32	other approaches, with helmets.
314.88	We've looked at other sensors
314.88	that go on your skin,
318.28	and they all simply move around too much,
320.92	and so we found that this
320.92	is the only reliable way
323.64	to take a good measurement.
327.4	So now that we've got this device,
327.4	we can go beyond studying cadavers,
331.72	because you can only
331.72	learn so much about concussion
334.16	from studying a cadaver,
335.4	and we want to learn
335.4	and study live humans.
338.2	So where can we find
338.2	a group of willing volunteers
342.12	to go out and smash their heads
342.12	into each other on a regular basis
346.4	and sustain concussion?
347.64	Well, I was one of them,
349.56	and it's your local friendly
349.56	Stanford football team.
353.64	So this is our laboratory,
355.28	and I want to show you
357	the first concussion
357	we measured with this device.
360.2	One of the things that I should point out
360.2	is the device has this gyroscope in it,
364.48	and that allows you
364.48	to measure the rotation of the head.
367.24	Most experts think
367.24	that that's the critical factor
369.64	that might start to tell us
369.64	what is happening in concussion.
372.52	So please watch this video.
375.28	Announcer: Cougars bring
375.28	extra people late, but Luck has time,
378.72	and Winslow is crushed.
382.12	I hope he's all right.
383.72	(Audience roars)
390.56	Top of your screen,
392.04	you'll see him come on
392.04	just this little post route,
394.48	get separation, safety.
400.24	Here it comes at you in real speed.
400.24	You'll hear this.
404.64	The hit delivered by --
407.72	David Camarillo: Sorry, three times
407.72	is probably a little excessive there.
411.2	But you get the idea.
412.48	So when you look at just the film here,
415.32	pretty much the only thing you can see
415.32	is he got hit really hard and he was hurt.
419.16	But when we extract the data
420.84	out of the mouthguard that he was wearing,
422.864	we can see much more detail,
422.864	much richer information.
425.6	And one of the things that we noticed here
428.04	is that he was struck
428.04	in the lower left side of his face mask.
432.12	And so that did something first
432.12	that was a little counterintuitive.
435.32	His head did not move to the right.
437.04	In fact, it rotated first to the left.
439	Then as the neck began to compress,
441.88	the force of the blow caused it
441.88	to whip back to the right.
445	So this left-right motion
445	was sort of a whiplash-type phenomenon,
450.88	and we think that is probably
450.88	what led to the brain injury.
455.32	Now, this device is only limited in such
455.32	that it can measure the skull motion,
459.12	but what we really want to know
459.12	is what's happening inside of the brain.
462.56	So we collaborate with
462.56	Svein Kleiven's group in Sweden.
466.08	They've developed a finite element
466.08	model of the brain.
469.68	And so this is a simulation
471.8	using the data from our mouthguard
471.8	from the injury I just showed you,
475.16	and what you see is the brain --
477.2	this is a cross-section right in the front
479.64	of the brain twisting
479.64	and contorting as I mentioned.
482.44	So you can see this doesn't
482.44	look a lot like the CDC video.
485.36	Now, the colors that you're looking at
487.24	are how much the brain tissue
487.24	is being stretched.
491.4	And so the red is 50 percent.
493.12	That means the brain has been stretched
493.12	to 50 percent of its original length,
496.8	the tissue in that particular area.
498.52	And the main thing I want to draw
498.52	your attention to is this red spot.
501.8	So the red spot is very close
501.8	to the center of the brain,
505.28	and relatively speaking,
506.56	you don't see a lot of colors like that
506.56	on the exterior surface
511.24	as the CDC video showed.
514.96	Now, to explain a little more detail
516.72	about how we think
516.72	concussion might be happening,
520.36	one thing I should mention
521.68	is that we and others have observed
521.68	that a concussion is more likely
524.919	when you're struck and your head
524.919	rotates in this direction.
528.919	This is more common
528.919	in sports like football,
531.2	but this seems to be more dangerous.
531.2	So what might be happening there?
534.559	Well, one thing that you'll notice
534.559	in the human brain
537.6	that is different than other animals
539.36	is we have these two very large lobes.
541.84	We have the right brain
541.84	and the left brain.
544.08	And the key thing
544.08	to notice in this figure here
547.16	is that right down the center
547.16	of the right brain and the left brain
550.44	there's a large fissure
550.44	that goes deep into the brain.
553.4	And in that fissure,
553.4	what you can't see in this image,
556.28	you'll have to trust me,
557.52	there is a fibrous sheet of tissue.
559.24	It's called the falx,
560.48	and it runs from the front of your head
560.48	all the way to the back of your head,
564.16	and it's quite stiff.
565.4	And so what that allows for
565.4	is when you're struck
568.88	and your head rotates
568.88	in this left-right direction,
571.96	forces can rapidly transmit
571.96	right down to the center of your brain.
575.76	Now, what's there
575.76	at the bottom of this fissure?
579.12	It's the wiring of your brain,
581.64	and in fact this red bundle
581.64	here at the bottom of that fissure
586.28	is the single largest fiber bundle
589.28	that is the wiring that connects
589.28	the right and left sides of your brain.
593.28	It's called the corpus callosum.
595.48	And we think that this might be
597.44	one of the most common
597.44	mechanisms of concussion,
601.28	and as the forces move down,
601.28	they strike the corpus callosum,
606	it causes a dissociation
606	between your right and your left brain
609	and could explain some
609	of the symptoms of concussion.
612.68	This finding is also consistent
612.68	of what we've seen
615.52	in this brain disease that I mentioned,
615.52	chronic traumatic encephalopathy.
619.56	So this is an image of a middle-aged
619.56	ex-professional football player,
625.12	and the thing that I want to point out
625.12	is if you look at the corpus callosum,
629.12	and I'll page back here so you can see
629.12	the size of a normal corpus callosum
633.08	and the size of the person here
633.08	who has chronic traumatic encephalopathy,
637.52	it is greatly atrophied.
640.08	And the same goes
640.08	for all of the space in the ventricles.
643.44	These ventricles are much larger.
645.24	And so all of this tissue
645.24	near the center of the brain
647.8	has died off over time.
649.04	So what we're learning
649.04	is indeed consistent.
653.52	Now, there is some good news here,
656.2	and I hope to give you a sense
656.2	of hope by the end of this talk.
659.68	One of the things that we've noticed,
661.8	specifically about
661.8	this mechanism of injury,
664.08	is although there's a rapid transmission
664.08	of the forces down this fissure,
668.16	it still takes a defined amount of time.
671.48	And what we think is that if we can
671.48	slow the head down just enough
675.84	so that the brain
675.84	does not lag behind the skull
679.08	but instead it moves
679.08	in synchrony with the skull,
682.68	then we might be able to prevent
682.68	this mechanism of concussion.
685.96	So how can we slow the head down?
690.64	(Laughter)
692.4	A gigantic helmet.
695.44	So with more space, you have more time,
698.32	and this is a bit of a joke,
698.32	but some of you may have seen this.
701.44	This is bubble soccer,
701.44	and it's a real sport.
703.76	In fact, I saw some young adults
705.44	playing this sport down the street
705.44	from my house the other day,
708.44	and as far as I know
708.44	there have been no reported concussions.
711.36	(Laughter)
712.4	But in all seriousness,
712.4	this principle does work,
716.84	but this has gone too far.
718.24	This isn't something that's practical
718.24	for bike riding or playing football.
723.52	And so we are collaborating
723.52	with a company in Sweden called Hövding.
727.92	Some of you may have seen their work,
730.28	and they're using the same principle
730.28	of air to give you some extra space
734.68	to prevent concussion.
737.32	Kids, don't try this at home please.
740.68	This stuntman does not have a helmet.
744.2	He instead has a neck collar,
746.48	and this neck collar has sensors in it,
749.08	the same type of sensors
749.08	that are in our mouthguard,
752.68	and it detects when he's likely
752.68	to have a fall,
755.84	and there's an airbag
755.84	that explodes and triggers,
758.2	the same way that an airbag
758.2	works in your car, essentially.
762	And in the experiments
762	we've done in my lab with their device,
764.96	we found that it can greatly reduce
764.96	the risk of concussion in some scenarios
768.72	compared to a normal bicycle helmet.
770.88	So it's a pretty exciting development.
773.72	But in order for us to actually realize
773.72	the benefits of technology
778.44	that can prevent concussion,
780.32	it needs to meet regulations.
783.28	That's a reality.
785	And this device is for sale in Europe
788.16	but is not for sale in the US,
788.16	and probably won't be any time soon.
791.88	So I wanted to tell you why.
793.44	There are some good reasons and then
793.44	there are some not so good reasons.
797.24	Bike helmets are federally regulated.
799.48	The Consumer Product Safety Commission
799.48	has been given jurisdiction
803.24	to approve any bike helmet for sale,
805.12	and this is the test they use.
806.6	This is back to what I was telling you
806.6	at the beginning about skull fracture.
810.28	That's what this test is for.
811.72	And that's an important thing to do.
813.48	It can save your life,
813.48	but it's not sufficient, I would say.
816.36	So for example, one thing
816.36	this test doesn't evaluate
819.12	is it doesn't tell you
819.12	is that airbag going to trigger
821.96	at the right time and place,
821.96	and not trigger when it doesn't need to?
825.88	Similarly, it's not going to tell you
827.96	is this helmet likely
827.96	to prevent concussion or not?
831.36	And if you look at football helmets,
831.36	which aren't regulated,
835.12	they still have a very similar test.
837.52	They're not regulated
837.52	by the government, anyway.
839.8	They have an industry body,
839.8	which is the way most industries work.
842.96	But this industry body, I can tell you,
842.96	has been quite resistant
846	to updating their standards.
847.4	So in my lab, we are working on not only
847.4	the mechanism of concussion,
850.68	but we want to understand
850.68	how can we have better test standards?
854.16	And we hope that the government
854.16	can use this type of information
858.72	to encourage innovation
860.48	by letting consumers know
862.12	how protected are you with a given helmet.
865.92	And I want to bring this back finally
865.92	to the original question I asked,
869.32	which is, would I feel comfortable
869.32	letting my child play football
872.68	or ride a bicycle?
874.44	And this might be just a result
874.44	of my own traumatic experience.
877.8	I'm much more nervous
877.8	about my daughter, Rose, riding a bicycle.
882.92	So she's a year and a half old,
884.6	and she's already, well, wants to anyway,
884.6	race down the streets of San Francisco.
890.08	This is the bottom
890.08	of one of these streets.
892.44	And so my personal goal
892.44	is to -- and I believe this is possible --
897.68	is to further develop these technologies,
899.76	and in fact, we're working
899.76	on something in my lab in particular
902.76	that really makes optimal use
902.76	of the given space of a helmet.
905.737	And I am confident
905.737	that we will be able to,
908.24	before she's ready to ride a two-wheeler,
911.48	have something available
912.88	that can in fact really reduce
912.88	the risk of concussion
916.24	and comply with regulatory bodies.
919.4	And so what I'd like to do --
921.04	and I know that this is for some of you
921.04	of more immediate nature,
924.44	I've got a couple years here --
926.12	is to be able to tell parents
926.12	and grandparents when I'm asked,
930.28	it is safe and healthy for your children
930.28	to engage in these activities.
934.72	And I'm very fortunate
934.72	to have a wonderful team at Stanford
937.56	that's working hard on this.
939.48	So I hope to come back in a few years
939.48	with the final story,
943.6	but for now I will tell you,
945.6	please don't just be afraid
945.6	when you hear the word concussion.
948.56	There is hope.
949.8	Thank you.
951.04	(Applause)
