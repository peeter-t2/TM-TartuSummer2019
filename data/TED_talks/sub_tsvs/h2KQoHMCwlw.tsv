12.926	We're at a tipping point in human history,
15.416	a species poised between gaining the stars
15.416	and losing the planet we call home.
21.332	Even in just the past few years,
21.332	we've greatly expanded
24.062	our knowledge of how Earth fits
24.062	within the context of our universe.
28.392	NASA's Kepler mission has discovered
31.13	thousands of potential planets
31.13	around other stars,
34.079	indicating that Earth is but one
34.079	of billions of planets in our galaxy.
38.273	Kepler is a space telescope
40.143	that measures the subtle dimming of stars
40.143	as planets pass in front of them,
44.434	blocking just a little bit
44.434	of that light from reaching us.
47.732	Kepler's data reveals planets' sizes
50.332	as well as their distance
50.332	from their parent star.
53.118	Together, this helps us understand
53.118	whether these planets are small and rocky,
57.158	like the terrestrial planets
57.158	in our own Solar System,
59.713	and also how much light they receive
59.713	from their parent sun.
63.079	In turn, this provides clues as to whether
63.079	these planets that we discover
66.957	might be habitable or not.
69.418	Unfortunately, at the same time
69.418	as we're discovering this treasure trove
73.481	of potentially habitable worlds,
75.594	our own planet is sagging
75.594	under the weight of humanity.
83.466	Glaciers and sea ice that have
83.466	been with us for millennia
86.809	are now disappearing
86.809	in a matter of decades.
89.944	These planetary-scale environmental 
89.944	changes that we have set in motion
95.055	are rapidly outpacing our ability
95.055	to alter their course.
99.347	But I'm not a climate scientist,
99.347	I'm an astronomer.
103.062	I study planetary habitability
103.062	as influenced by stars
106.432	with the hopes of finding
106.432	the places in the universe
108.89	where we might discover
108.89	life beyond our own planet.
111.862	You could say that I look for
111.862	choice alien real estate.
115.902	Now, as somebody who is deeply embedded
115.902	in the search for life in the universe,
120.244	I can tell you that the more
120.244	you look for planets like Earth,
123.611	the more you appreciate
123.611	our own planet itself.
127.257	Each one of these new worlds
127.257	invites a comparison
129.95	between the newly discovered planet
129.95	and the planets we know best:
133.572	those of our own Solar System.
135.662	Consider our neighbor, Mars.
137.624	Mars is small and rocky,
137.624	and though it's a bit far from the Sun,
141.409	it might be considered
141.409	a potentially habitable world
143.934	if found by a mission like Kepler.
145.936	Indeed, it's possible that Mars
145.936	was habitable in the past,
149.303	and in part, this is why
149.303	we study Mars so much.
152.74	Our rovers, like Curiosity,
152.74	crawl across its surface,
156.13	scratching for clues as to the origins
156.13	of life as we know it.
159.38	Orbiters like the MAVEN mission
159.38	sample the Martian atmosphere,
162.886	trying to understand how Mars
162.886	might have lost its past habitability.
166.578	Private spaceflight companies now offer
166.578	not just a short trip to near space
171.143	but the tantalizing possibility
171.143	of living our lives on Mars.
174.844	But though these Martian vistas
176.794	resemble the deserts
176.794	of our own home world,
179.349	places that are tied in our imagination
179.349	to ideas about pioneering and frontiers,
184.921	compared to Earth
186.593	Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
189.89	Consider the extent to which
189.89	we have not colonized
193.164	the deserts of our own planet,
195.068	places that are lush
195.068	by comparison with Mars.
197.901	Even in the driest,
197.901	highest places on Earth,
200.687	the air is sweet and thick with oxygen
203.287	exhaled from thousands of miles away
203.287	by our rainforests.
207.374	I worry -- I worry that this excitement
207.374	about colonizing Mars and other planets
213.318	carries with it a long, dark shadow:
216.429	the implication and belief by some
218.449	that Mars will be there to save us
218.449	from the self-inflicted destruction
222.002	of the only truly habitable planet
222.002	we know of, the Earth.
226.135	As much as I love
226.135	interplanetary exploration,
228.573	I deeply disagree with this idea.
230.918	There are many excellent reasons
230.918	to go to Mars,
233.611	but for anyone to tell you that Mars
233.611	will be there to back up humanity
237.025	is like the captain of the Titanic
237.025	telling you that the real party
240.133	is happening later on the lifeboats.
242.504	(Laughter)
245.453	(Applause)
248.355	Thank you.
251.142	But the goals of interplanetary
251.142	exploration and planetary preservation
254.928	are not opposed to one another.
257.109	No, they're in fact two sides
257.109	of the same goal:
259.64	to understand, preserve
259.64	and improve life into the future.
263.982	The extreme environments
263.982	of our own world are alien vistas.
268.045	They're just closer to home.
269.926	If we can understand how to create
269.926	and maintain habitable spaces
274.105	out of hostile, inhospitable
274.105	spaces here on Earth,
277.495	perhaps we can meet the needs
277.495	of both preserving our own environment
280.932	and moving beyond it.
283.161	I leave you with a final
283.161	thought experiment:
285.471	Fermi's paradox.
287.166	Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi
287.166	asked that, given the fact
292.028	that our universe has been around
292.028	for a very long time
294.875	and we expect that there
294.875	are many planets within it,
297.545	we should have found evidence
297.545	for alien life by now.
300.633	So where are they?
302.676	Well, one possible solution
302.676	to Fermi's paradox
306.043	is that, as civilizations become
306.043	technologically advanced enough
309.526	to consider living amongst the stars,
311.848	they lose sight of how important it is
314.332	to safeguard the home worlds that fostered
314.332	that advancement to begin with.
318.86	It is hubris to believe
318.86	that interplanetary colonization alone
323.248	will save us from ourselves,
325.129	but planetary preservation
325.129	and interplanetary exploration
328.658	can work together.
330.552	If we truly believe in our ability
332.675	to bend the hostile environments of Mars
332.675	for human habitation,
336.181	then we should be able to surmount
336.181	the far easier task of preserving
339.767	the habitability of the Earth.
341.94	Thank you.
342.996	(Applause)
