13.286	In this talk today, I want to present a different idea
17.774	for why investing in early childhood education
21.995	makes sense as a public investment.
24.694	It's a different idea, because usually,
26.932	when people talk about early childhood programs,
28.305	they talk about all the wonderful benefits for participants
31.646	in terms of former participants, in preschool,
34.928	they have better K-12 test scores,
37.193	better adult earnings.
39.308	Now that's all very important,
41.423	but what I want to talk about is what preschool does
45.519	for state economies
47.341	and for promoting state economic development.
50.638	And that's actually crucial
53.931	because if we're going to get increased investment
57.255	in early childhood programs,
59.598	we need to interest state governments in this.
63.121	The federal government has a lot on its plate,
65.347	and state governments are going to have to step up.
67.845	So we have to appeal to them,
70.028	the legislators in the state government,
72.581	and turn to something they understand,
74.571	that they have to promote the economic development
76.869	of their state economy.
78.556	Now, by promoting economic development,
80.372	I don't mean anything magical.
82.086	All I mean is, is that early childhood education
85.549	can bring more and better jobs to a state
89.452	and can thereby promote higher per capita earnings
92.63	for the state's residents.
94.58	Now, I think it's fair to say that when people think about
98.573	state and local economic development,
100.577	they don't generally think first about what they're doing
104.359	about childcare and early childhood programs.
106.914	I know this. I've spent most of my career researching these programs.
110.817	I've talked to a lot of directors
112.44	of state economic development agencies about these issues,
114.768	a lot of legislators about these issues.
117.31	When legislators and others think about economic development,
120.369	what they first of all think about are business tax incentives,
123.625	property tax abatements, job creation tax credits,
126.503	you know, there are a million of these programs all over the place.
129.19	So for example, states compete very vigorously
131.796	to attract new auto plants or expanded auto plants.
135.461	They hand out all kinds of business tax breaks.
137.601	Now, those programs can make sense
139.799	if they in fact induce new location decisions,
142.801	and the way they can make sense is,
144.186	by creating more and better jobs,
146.499	they raise employment rates, raise per capita earnings of state residents.
150.082	So there is a benefit to state residents
152.152	that corresponds to the costs that they're paying
154.301	by paying for these business tax breaks.
156.574	My argument is essentially that early childhood programs
160.382	can do exactly the same thing,
164.107	create more and better jobs, but in a different way.
168.016	It's a somewhat more indirect way.
170.434	These programs can promote more and better jobs by,
174.08	you build it, you invest in high-quality preschool,
176.955	it develops the skills of your local workforce
180.773	if enough of them stick around, and, in turn,
184.516	that higher-quality local workforce
186.669	will be a key driver of creating jobs and creating
191.361	higher earnings per capita in the local community.
193.869	Now, let me turn to some numbers on this.
196.833	Okay. If you look at the research evidence --
201.416	that's extensive -- on how much early childhood programs
206.079	affect the educational attainment, wages and skills
210.676	of former participants in preschool as adults,
214.185	you take those known effects,
216.821	you take how many of those folks will be expected
219.509	to stick around the state or local economy and not move out,
223.21	and you take research on how much skills
227.03	drive job creation, you will conclude,
230.201	from these three separate lines of research,
232.244	that for every dollar invested in early childhood programs,
236.323	the per capita earnings of state residents
239.776	go up by two dollars and 78 cents,
242.542	so that's a three-to-one return.
244.409	Now you can get much higher returns,
247.442	of up to 16-to-one, if you include anti-crime benefits,
251.516	if you include benefits to former preschool participants
256.23	who move to some other state,
258.414	but there's a good reason for focusing on these three dollars
261.425	because this is salient and important
263.512	to state legislators and state policy makers,
265.802	and it's the states that are going to have to act.
267.946	So there is this key benefit that is relevant
271.245	to state policy makers in terms of economic development.
274.494	Now, one objection you often hear,
277.912	or maybe you don't hear it because people are too polite to say it, is,
282.809	why should I pay more taxes
287.272	to invest in other people's children?
291.55	What's in it for me?
294.044	And the trouble with that objection,
296.323	it reflects a total misunderstanding
300.325	of how much local economies
303.342	involve everyone being interdependent.
306.848	Specifically, the interdependency here is, is that
310.765	there are huge spillovers of skills --
314.298	that when other people's children get more skills,
319.618	that actually increases the prosperity of everyone,
323.387	including people whose skills don't change.
326.741	So for example, numerous research studies have shown
329.145	if you look at what really drives
331.724	the growth rate of metropolitan areas,
334.188	it's not so much low taxes, low cost, low wages;
339.858	it's the skills of the area. Particularly, the proxy for skills
343.481	that people use is percentage of college graduates in the area.
347.016	So when you look, for example, at metropolitan areas
350.095	such as the Boston area, Minneapolis-St. Paul,
353.608	Silicon Valley, these areas are not doing well economically
358.944	because they're low-cost.
361.253	I don't know if you ever tried to buy a house in Silicon Valley.
363.178	It's not exactly a low-cost proposition.
365.995	They are growing because they have high levels of skills.
371.94	So when we invest in other people's children,
375.095	and build up those skills, we increase the overall job growth
379.28	of a metro area.
380.801	As another example, if we look
384.689	at what determines an individual's wages,
387.924	and we do statistical exploration of that, what determines wages,
392.149	we know that the individual's wages will depend, in part,
396.672	on that individual's education,
399.103	for example whether or not they have a college degree.
402.096	One of the very interesting facts is that, in addition,
405.434	we find that even once we hold constant, statistically,
409.481	the effect of your own education,
412.385	the education of everyone else in your metropolitan area
415.585	also affects your wages.
417.557	So specifically, if you hold constant your education,
421.761	you stick in percentage of college graduates in your metro area,
425.864	you will find that has a significant positive effect on your wages
429.824	without changing your education at all.
433.294	In fact, this effect is so strong
436.445	that when someone gets a college degree,
440.258	the spillover effects of this on the wages
442.699	of others in the metropolitan area
444.592	are actually greater than the direct effects.
447.694	So if someone gets a college degree, their lifetime earnings
451.147	go up by a huge amount, over 700,000 dollars.
454.462	There's an effect on everyone else in the metro area
456.977	of driving up the percentage of college graduates in the metro area,
460.84	and if you add that up -- it's a small effect for each person,
464.256	but if you add that up across all the people in the metro area,
467.688	you actually get that the increase in wages for everyone else
471.314	in the metropolitan area adds up to almost a million dollars.
474.227	That's actually greater than the direct benefits
476.305	of the person choosing to get education.
479.359	Now, what's going on here?
480.718	What can explain these huge spillover effects of education?
484.641	Well, let's think about it this way.
486.115	I can be the most skilled person in the world,
489.438	but if everyone else at my firm lacks skills,
493.239	my employer is going to find it more difficult
496.208	to introduce new technology, new production techniques.
500.264	So as a result, my employer is going to be less productive.
503.866	They will not be able to afford to pay me as good wages.
507.467	Even if everyone at my firm has good skills,
511.148	if the workers at the suppliers to my firm
514.656	do not have good skills,
516.626	my firm is going to be less competitive
519.023	competing in national and international markets.
521.408	And again, the firm that's less competitive
524.502	will not be able to pay as good wages,
527.191	and then, particularly in high-tech businesses,
531.324	they're constantly stealing ideas and workers from other businesses.
534.585	So clearly the productivity of firms in Silicon Valley
537.805	has a lot to do with the skills not only of the workers at their firm,
541.6	but the workers at all the other firms in the metro area.
546.019	So as a result, if we can invest in other people's children
549.553	through preschool and other early childhood programs
551.955	that are high-quality, we not only help those children,
555.611	we help everyone in the metropolitan area
559.232	gain in wages and we'll have the metropolitan area
562.903	gain in job growth.
564.925	Another objection used sometimes here
567.456	to invest in early childhood programs
569.684	is concern about people moving out.
573.405	So, you know, maybe Ohio's thinking about investing
577.64	in more preschool education
579.884	for children in Columbus, Ohio,
583.694	but they're worried that these little Buckeyes will,
585.953	for some strange reason, decide to move to Ann Arbor, Michigan,
588.87	and become Wolverines.
590.387	And maybe Michigan will be thinking about investing
593.681	in preschool in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and be worried
596.122	these little Wolverines will end up moving to Ohio and becoming Buckeyes.
599.357	And so they'll both underinvest because everyone's going to move out.
603.349	Well, the reality is, if you look at the data,
606.29	Americans aren't as hyper-mobile as people sometimes assume.
610.503	The data is that over 60 percent of Americans
615.623	spend most of their working careers
618.061	in the state they were born in, over 60 percent.
621.831	That percentage does not vary much from state to state.
625.926	It doesn't vary much with the state's economy,
629.03	whether it's depressed or booming,
630.828	it doesn't vary much over time.
633.149	So the reality is, if you invest in kids,
638.962	they will stay.
641.461	Or at least, enough of them will stay
644.499	that it will pay off for your state economy.
647.92	Okay, so to sum up, there is a lot of research evidence
651.844	that early childhood programs, if run in a high-quality way,
654.998	pay off in higher adult skills.
657.854	There's a lot of research evidence
659.421	that those folks will stick around the state economy,
663.045	and there's a lot of evidence that having more workers
666.362	with higher skills in your local economy
668.452	pays off in higher wages and job growth for your local economy,
672.131	and if you calculate the numbers for each dollar,
675.574	we get about three dollars back
678.303	in benefits for the state economy.
680.478	So in my opinion, the research evidence is compelling
684.09	and the logic of this is compelling.
686.914	So what are the barriers to getting it done?
690.604	Well, one obvious barrier is cost.
693.868	So if you look at what it would cost
698.198	if every state government invested
701.025	in universal preschool at age four, full-day preschool at age four,
705.23	the total annual national cost would be roughly
710.95	So, 30 billion dollars is a lot of money.
713.375	On the other hand, if you reflect on
717.12	that the U.S.'s population is over 300 million,
720.98	we're talking about an amount of money
723.663	that amounts to 100 dollars per capita.
726.283	Okay? A hundred dollars per capita, per person,
729.261	is something that any state government can afford to do.
733.266	It's just a simple matter of political will to do it.
738.015	And, of course, as I mentioned,
739.895	this cost has corresponding benefits.
742.049	I mentioned there's a multiplier of about three,
744.225	2.78, for the state economy,
746.325	in terms of over 80 billion in extra earnings.
749.354	And if we want to translate that from just billions of dollars
752.378	to something that might mean something,
754.271	what we're talking about is that, for the average low-income kid,
757.859	that would increase earnings by about 10 percent
760.976	over their whole career, just doing the preschool,
764.175	not improving K-12 or anything else after that,
766.69	not doing anything with college tuition or access,
769.238	just directly improving preschool,
771.934	and we would get five percent higher earnings
774.233	for middle-class kids.
775.629	So this is an investment
777.694	that pays off in very concrete terms
780.602	for a broad range of income groups in the state's population
785.022	and produces large and tangible benefits.
789.532	Now, that's one barrier.
792.086	I actually think the more profound barrier
795.508	is the long-term nature of the benefits from early childhood programs.
799.938	So the argument I'm making is, is that we're increasing
802.784	the quality of our local workforce,
804.539	and thereby increasing economic development.
807.205	Obviously if we have a preschool with four-year-olds,
810.585	we're not sending these kids out at age five
812.953	to work in the sweatshops, right? At least I hope not.
816.468	So we're talking about an investment
819.88	that in terms of impacts on the state economy
822.35	is not going to really pay off for 15 or 20 years,
826.311	and of course America is notorious for being
829.169	a short term-oriented society.
832.176	Now one response you can make to this,
833.836	and I sometimes have done this in talks,
835.361	is people can talk about, there are benefits for these programs
838.438	in reducing special ed and remedial education costs,
842.085	there are benefits, parents care about preschool,
844.391	maybe we'll get some migration effects
846.641	from parents seeking good preschool,
848.959	and I think those are true,
850.606	but in some sense they're missing the point.
852.768	Ultimately, this is something
855.339	we're investing in now for the future.
859.264	And so what I want to leave you with is
863.213	what I think is the ultimate question.
865.519	I mean, I'm an economist, but this is ultimately
868.353	not an economic question, it's a moral question:
873.898	Are we willing, as Americans,
878.105	are we as a society still capable
881.555	of making the political choice to sacrifice now
886.339	by paying more taxes
888.988	in order to improve the long-term future
894.193	of not only our kids, but our community?
897.61	Are we still capable of that as a country?
902.057	And that's something that each and every citizen
904.498	and voter needs to ask themselves.
907.041	Is that something that you are still invested in,
909.986	that you still believe in the notion of investment?
912.72	That is the notion of investment.
914.119	You sacrifice now for a return later.
916.693	So I think the research evidence
920.331	on the benefits of early childhood programs
922.969	for the local economy is extremely strong.
926.576	However, the moral and political choice
930.858	is still up to us, as citizens and as voters.
935.962	Thank you very much. (Applause)
