26	I don't know your name. Audience Member: Howard. Howard.
28	Thom Mayne: Howard? I'm sitting next to Howard. I don't know Howard, obviously,
33	and he's going, I hope you're not next.
35	(Laughter)
42	Amazing. Amazing performance.
44	I kind of erased everything in my brain to follow that.
49	Let me start some place. I'm interested --
54	I kind of do the same thing, but I don't move my body. (Laughter)
58	And instead of using human figures to develop ideas of time and space,
69	I work in the mineral world. I work with more or less inert matter.
73	And I organize it. And, well, it's also a bit different
77	because an architect versus, let's say, a dance company
81	finally is a negotiation between one's private world,
86	one's conceptual world, the world of ideas, the world of aspirations,
91	of inventions, with the relationship of the exterior world
95	and all the limitations, the naysayers.
100	Because I have to say, for my whole career,
103	if there's anything that's been consistent, it's been that you can't do it.
106	No matter what I've done, what I've tried to do,
108	everybody says it can't be done.
110	And it's continuous across the complete spectrum of the various
114	kind of realities that you confront with your ideas.
116	And to be an architect, somehow you have to negotiate between left and right,
121	and you have to negotiate between this very private place where ideas take place
125	and the outside world, and then make it understood.
129	I can start any number of places, because this process is also --
134	I think -- very different from some of the morning sessions,
137	which you had such a kind of very clear, such a lineal idea,
141	like the last one, say, with Howard,
143	that I think the creative process in architecture,
146	the design process, is extremely circuitous. It's labyrinthine.
151	It's Calvino's idea of the quickest way between two points
155	is the circuitous line, not the straight line.
157	And definitely my life has been part of that.
159	I'm going to start with some simple kind of
161	notions of how we organize things.
163	But basically, what we do is, we try to give coherence to the world.
167	We make physical things, buildings
169	that become a part in an accretional process; they make cities.
172	And those things are the reflection of the processes,
177	and the time that they are made.
179	And what I'm doing is attempting to synthesize the way one sees the world
184	and the territories which are useful as generative material.
189	Because, really, all I'm interested in, always, as an architect,
193	is the way things are produced because that's what I do. Right?
197	And it's not based on an a priori notion.
199	I have no interest at all in conceiving something in my brain
203	"and saying, ""This is what it looks like."" In fact, somebody mentioned --"
206	Ewan, maybe it was you in your introduction --
208	about this is what architects --
210	did somebody say it's what business people come to,
212	it's what the corporate world comes to
214	when they want to make it look like something at the end of the line? Huh. Wow.
218	It doesn't work that way for me at all.
220	I have no interest in that whatsoever.
222	Architecture is the beginning of something, because it's --
224	if you're not involved in first principles,
226	if you're not involved in the absolute,
228	the beginning of that generative process, it's cake decoration.
233	And I've nothing wrong with cake decoration and cake decorators,
236	if anybody's involved in cake decorations --
238	it's not what I'm interested in doing. (Laughter)
240	And so, in the formation of things, in giving it form,
245	in concretizing these things,
248	it starts with some notion of how one organizes.
251	And I've had for 30 years an interest in a series of complexities
256	where a series of forces are brought to bear,
259	and to understand the nature of the final result of that,
263	representing the building itself.
266	There's been a continual relationship between inventions,
270	which are private, and reality, which has been important to me.
274	A project which is part of an exhibition in Copenhagen 10 years ago,
279	which was the modeling of a hippocampus --
281	the territory of the brain that records short-term memory --
284	and the documentation of that, the imaginative and documentation of that
288	through a series of drawings which literally attempt to organize that experience.
293	And it had to do with the notion of walking a kilometer,
297	observing every kilometer a particular object of desire,
300	and then placing that within this.
302	And the notion was that I could make an organization
305	not built on normal coherencies, but built on non-sequiturs, built on randomness.
311	And I'd been extremely interested in this notion of randomness
314	as it produces architectural work
316	and as it definitely connects to the notion of the city,
318	an accretional notion of the city,
320	and that led to various ideas of organization.
323	And then this led to broader ideas of buildings
326	that come together through the multiplicity of systems.
330	And it's not any single system that makes the work.
333	It's the relationship -- it's the dynamics between the systems --
336	which have the power to transform and invent
339	and produce an architecture that is -- that would otherwise not exist.
345	And those systems could be identified,
347	and they could be grouped together.
348	And of course, today, with the technology of the computer
351	and with the rapid prototyping, etc., we have the mechanisms
355	to understand and to respond to these systems,
358	and to allow them to adjust to the various accommodations of functionalities
363	because that's all we do.
365	We're producing spaces that accommodate human activity.
368	And what I'm interested in is not the styling of that,
371	but the relationship of that as it enhances that activity.
377	And that directly connects to ideas of city-making.
380	This is a project that we just finished in Penang
382	for a very, very large city project that came directly out of this process,
386	which is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it.
392	And the project -- again, enormous, enormous competition --
394	on the Hudson River and in New York
396	that we were asked to do three years ago, which uses these processes.
399	And what you're looking at are possibilities that have to do
402	with the generation of the city as one applies a methodology
408	that uses notions of these multiple forces,
411	that deals with the enormity of the problem, the complexity of the problem,
416	when we're designing cities at larger and larger aggregates.
419	Because one of the issues today is
421	that the economic aggregate is driving the development aggregate,
426	and as the aggregates get larger we require
428	more and more complex investigation processes to solve these problems.
433	And that led us directly to the Olympic Village.
436	I was in New York on Monday presenting it to the IOC.
439	We won the competition -- what was it, nine months ago?
443	Again, a direct reflection from using these processes
446	to develop extremely complicated, very large-scale organisms.
451	And then, also, was working with broad strategies.
454	In this case, we only used 15 of the 60 acres of land,
459	and the 45 acres was a park and would become the legacy of the Olympic Village.
463	And it would become the second largest park in the boroughs, etc.
467	Its position, of course, in the middle of Manhattan -- it's on Hunter's Point.
471	And then the broader ideas of city-making
475	start having direct influences on architecture,
478	on the elements that make up the broader scheme,
481	the buildings themselves, and start guiding us.
486	Architecture for me has been an investigation of a multiplicity of forces
490	that could come from literally any place.
492	And so I can start this discussion in any number of places,
496	and I've chosen three or four to talk about.
499	And it has also to do with an interest in
504	the vast kind of territory that architecture touches.
508	It literally is connected to anything in terms of knowledge base.
513	There's just no place that it doesn't somehow
516	have a connective tissue to.
518	This is Jim Dine, and it's the absence of presence, etc.
521	It's the clothing, the skin, without the presence of the character.
525	It became kind of an idea for the notion of the surface of a work,
529	and it was used in a project where we could unravel that surface,
534	and it was a figurative idea that was going to be folded
538	and made into a very, kind of complex space.
541	And the idea was the relationship of the space,
544	which was made up of the fold of the image,
547	and the dialectic or the conflict between the figuration,
552	and the clarity of the image
554	and the complexity of the space, which were in dialog.
557	And it made us rethink the whole notion of how we work
560	and how we make things,
562	and it led us to ideas that were closer to fashion design as we flattened out surfaces,
568	and then brought them back together as they could make spatial combinations.
571	And this was the first prototype in Korea,
574	as we're dealing with a dynamic envelope,
577	and then the same characteristic of the fabric.
580	It has a material identity and it's translucent and it's porous,
585	and it allows us for a very different notion of what a skin of a building is.
589	And that turned right away into another project.
591	This is the Caltrans building in Los Angeles.
594	And now we're seeing as the skin and the body is differentiated.
598	Again, it's a very, very simple notion.
600	If you look at most buildings,
602	what you look at is the building, the facade, and it is the building.
604	And all of a sudden we're kind of moving away,
606	and we're separating the skin from the body,
608	and that's going to lead to broader performance criteria,
610	which I'm going to talk about in a minute.
612	And you're looking at how it drapes over
614	and differentiates from the body.
616	And then, again, the building itself,
619	middle of Los Angeles, right across from City Hall.
622	And as it moves, it takes pieces of the earth with it. It bends up.
625	It's part of a sign system,
627	which was part of the kind of legacy of Los Angeles --
629	the two-dimension, three-dimension signing, etc.
633	And then it allows one to penetrate the work itself.
637	It's transparent, and it allows you to understand, I think,
641	what is always the most interesting thing in any building,
643	which is the actual constructional processes that make it.
646	And it's probably the most intense kind of territory
651	of the work, which is not occupied,
653	because architecture is always the most interesting in some mechanism
656	when it's separated from function,
658	and this is an area that allows for that.
660	And then the skin starts transforming into other materials.
663	We're using light as a building material in this case.
665	We're working with Keith Sonnier in New York,
667	and we're making this large outside room,
669	which is possible in Los Angeles, and which is very much reflective
673	of the urban, the contemporary urban environments
676	that you would find in Shibuya or you'd find in Mexico City
679	or Sao Paulo, etc.,
681	that have to do with activating the city over a longer span of time.
685	And that was very much part of the notion
687	of the urban objective of this project in Los Angeles.
691	And, again, all of it promoting transparency.
695	And an image which may be closest talks about the use of light as a medium,
702	that light becomes literally a building material.
705	Well, that immediately turned into something much broader, and as a scope.
709	And again, we're looking at an early sketch
713	where I'm understanding now
715	that the skin can be a transition between the ground and the tower.
718	This is a building in San Francisco which is under construction.
721	And now it turned into something much, much broader as a problem,
725	and it has to do with performance.
727	This will be the first building in the United States that took --
730	well, I can't say it took the air conditioning out. It's a hybrid.
732	I wanted a pure thing, and I can't get it.
734	It's a wrong attitude, actually, because the hybrid is probably more interesting.
737	But we took the air conditioning out of the tower.
739	There's some air conditioning left in the base,
741	but the skin now moves on hydraulics.
743	It forces air through a Venturi force if there's no wind.
747	It adjusts continually. And we removed the air conditioning.
750	Huge, huge thing. Half a million dollars a year delta.
761	And so now what we're looking at, as the projects get larger in scale,
764	as they interface with broader problems,
769	that they expand the capabilities
772	in terms of their performance.
775	Well, I could also start here.
777	We could talk about the relationship
779	at a more biological sense of the relationship of building and ground.
783	Well, our research -- my generation for sure,
786	people who were going to school in the late '60s --
788	made very much a shift out of the internal focus of architecture,
794	looking at architecture within its own territory,
796	and we were much more affected by film,
798	by what was going on in the art world, etc.
800	This is, of course, Michael Heizer.
802	And when I saw this, first an image and then visited,
806	it completely changed the way I thought after that point.
810	And I understood that building really could be
812	the augmentation of the Earth's surface,
814	and it completely shifted the notion of building ground in the most basic sense.
819	And then -- well, he was probably looking at this -- this is Nazca;
822	this is 700 years ago -- the most amazing four-kilometer land sculptures.
829	They're just totally incredible.
831	And that led us to then completely rethinking how we draw, how we work.
835	This is the first sketch of a high school in Pomona --
838	well, whatever it is, a model, a conceptual, kind of idea.
842	And it's the reshaping of the Earth to make it occupiable.
846	So it puts 200,000 square feet of stuff that make a high school work
851	in the surface of that Earth.
853	There it is modeled as it was developing into a piece of work.
856	And there it is, again, as it's starting to get resolved tectonically,
860	and then there's the school.
862	And, of course,
864	we're interested in participating with education.
866	I have absolutely no interest in producing a building
868	that just accommodates X, Y and Z function.
870	What I'm interested in are how these ideas
872	participate in the educational process of young people.
875	It demands some sort of notion of inquiry
877	because it's a system that's developed not sculpturally.
879	It's an idea that started from my first discussion.
882	It has to do with a broad, consistent logic,
885	and that logic could be understood as one occupies the building.
889	And there's an overt -- at least,
891	there's an attempt to make a very overt notion of a building
894	that connects to the land in a very different way
896	because I was interested in a very didactic approach to the problem,
899	as one would understand that.
901	And the second project that was just finished in Los Angeles
903	that uses some of the same ideas. It uses landscape as a major idea.
907	Then, again, we're doing the headquarters for NOAA --
910	National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency --
913	outside of Washington in Maryland.
915	And this is how they see the world.
917	They have 22 satellites zipping around at plus or minus 100 miles,
921	and the site's in red.
923	And what we really want to do -- well, the architects,
926	if there are architects out there, this is the Laugier Hut;
929	this is the primitive hut that's been around for so long --
931	and what we wanted to do is really build this,
933	because they see themselves as the caretakers of the world,
937	and we wanted them to look down at their satellite,
939	how they see their own site, that eight-acre site,
941	and we wanted nothing left. We wanted it to stay green.
944	There's actually three baseball fields on it right now,
946	and they're going to stay there.
947	We put one piece directly north-south,
949	and it holds the dishes at the ears, right?
952	And then right below that the processing, and the mission lift,
955	and the mission control room, and all the other spaces are underground.
959	And what you look at is an aircraft carrier
961	that's performance-driven by the cone vision of these satellite dishes.
965	And that the building itself is occupied in the lower portion,
969	broken up by a series of courts,
971	and it's five acres of uninterrupted, horizontal space
974	for their administrative offices.
977	And then that, in turn, propelled us to look at
980	larger-scale projects where this notion of landscape building interface
984	becomes a connective tissue.
986	The new capital competition for Berlin, four years ago.
992	And again we just finished the ECB --
994	actually Coop Himmelblau in Vienna just won this project,
997	where the building was separated into a series of landscape elements
1003	that became part of a connective tissue of a park,
1006	which is parallel to the river, and develops ideas of the buildings themselves
1012	and becomes part of the connective fabric --
1015	the social, cultural and the landscape, recreational fabric of the city.
1020	And the building is no longer seen as an autonomous thing,
1022	but something that's only inextricably connected
1024	to this city and this place at this time.
1026	And a project that was realized in Austria, the Hooper Bank,
1030	which again used this idea of connecting typology,
1033	the traditional buildings, and morphology,
1036	or the relationship of the development of land as an idea,
1039	into a complex, which is a piece of a city where we can see part of it
1043	is literally just this augmenting,
1045	this movement of the land that's a very simple idea of
1048	just lifting it up and occupying it,
1049	and other parts are much more energetic and intense.
1052	And talk about that intensity
1054	in terms of the collisions of the kind of events they make
1058	that have to do with putting a series of systems together,
1060	and then where part of it is in the ground, part of it is oppositional lifts.
1064	One enters the building as it lifts off the ground,
1067	and it becomes part of the idea.
1069	And then the skin -- the edges of this --
1072	all promote the dynamic, the movement of the building
1075	as a series of seismic shifts, geologic shifts. Right?
1080	And it makes for event space and then it breaks in places
1084	that allow you to peer into the interior, and those interiors, again,
1087	are promoting transparency for the workplace,
1089	which has been a continual interest of ours.
1094	And then, again, in a more, kind of traditional setting,
1097	this is a graduate student housing in Toronto,
1099	and it's very much about the relationship of a building
1103	as it makes a connective tissue to the city.
1105	The main idea was the gateway, where it breaks the site,
1108	and the building occupies both the public space and the private space.
1112	And it's that territory of -- it's this thing.
1116	I visited the site many times, and everybody, kind of --
1119	you can see this from two kilometers away; it's an exact center of the street,
1123	and the whole notion is to engage the public,
1125	to engage buildings as part of the public tissue of the city.
1131	And finally, one of the most interesting projects -- it's a courthouse.
1135	And what I want to talk about -- this is the Supreme Court, of course --
1138	and, well, I'm dealing with Michael Hogan, the Chief Justice of Oregon.
1142	You could not proceed without making this negotiation
1146	between one's own values and the relationship
1150	of the character you're working with and how he understands the court,
1154	because I'm showing him, of course, Corbusier at Savoy,
1157	which is 1928, which is the beginning of modern architecture.
1160	Well, then we get to this image.
1163	And this is where the project started. Because I'm going,
1167	I'm interested in the phenomenon that's taking place in here.
1172	And really what we're talking about is constructing reality.
1176	And I'm a character that's extremely interested
1178	in understanding the nature of that constructed reality
1181	because there's no such thing as nature any more. Nature is gone.
1185	Nature in the 19th-century sense, alright?
1187	Nature is only a cultural edifice today, right?
1190	We construct it and we construct those ideas.
1193	And then of course, this one, our governor at the moment.
1196	And we spent some time with Conan, believe it or not,
1201	and then that led us to, kind of, the very differences of our worlds
1205	from a legal and an artistic, architectural.
1207	And it forced us to talk about notions of how we work,
1211	and the dynamics of that, and what other sources of the work is.
1214	And it led us to the project, the courthouse,
1217	which is absolutely a part of a negotiation
1220	between tradition and pieces of the traditional courthouse.
1223	You'll find a stair that's the same length as the Supreme Court.
1225	Here's a piano nobile, which is a device used in the Renaissance.
1228	The courts were made of that. The skin is this series of layers
1232	that reflect even rusticated stonework,
1235	but which were embedded with fragments of the Constitution,
1239	which were part of the little process,
1241	all set on a plinth that defined it from the community.
1243	Thank you so much.
1245	(Applause)
