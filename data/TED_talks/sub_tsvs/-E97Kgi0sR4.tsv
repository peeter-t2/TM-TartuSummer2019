15.539	I study the future
18.362	of crime and terrorism,
22.647	and frankly, I'm afraid.
25.007	I'm afraid by what I see.
26.969	I sincerely want to believe
29.114	that technology can bring us
31.906	the techno-utopia that we've been promised,
34.963	but, you see,
36.699	I've spent a career in law enforcement,
39.812	and that's informed my perspective on things.
42.585	I've been a street police officer,
44.218	an undercover investigator,
46.289	a counter-terrorism strategist,
48.297	and I've worked in more than 70 countries
50.522	around the world.
51.988	I've had to see more than my fair share
53.644	of violence and the darker underbelly of society,
56.889	and that's informed my opinions.
61.35	My work with criminals and terrorists
62.937	has actually been highly educational.
65.057	They have taught me a lot, and I'd like to be able
67.766	to share some of these observations with you.
71.665	Today I'm going to show you the flip side
73.984	of all those technologies that we marvel at,
77.999	the ones that we love.
79.862	In the hands of the TED community,
81.728	these are awesome tools which will bring about
84.641	great change for our world,
88.1	but in the hands of suicide bombers,
90.826	the future can look quite different.
94.262	I started observing
96.415	technology and how criminals were using it
98.311	as a young patrol officer.
100.302	In those days, this was the height of technology.
104.758	Laugh though you will,
106.327	all the drug dealers and gang members
107.622	with whom I dealt had one of these
109.823	long before any police officer I knew did.
114.114	Twenty years later, criminals are still using
116.974	mobile phones, but they're also building
120.857	their own mobile phone networks,
123.206	like this one, which has been deployed
125.438	in all 31 states of Mexico by the narcos.
129.238	They have a national encrypted
131.374	radio communications system.
134.583	Think about that.
136.693	Think about the innovation that went into that.
140.075	Think about the infrastructure to build it.
142.972	And then think about this:
144.377	Why can't I get a cell phone signal in San Francisco? (Laughter)
148.427	How is this possible? (Laughter) It makes no sense. (Applause)
153.514	We consistently underestimate
154.872	what criminals and terrorists can do.
158.176	Technology has made our world
159.784	increasingly open, and for the most part,
161.864	that's great, but all of this openness
164.217	may have unintended consequences.
166.262	Consider the 2008 terrorist attack on Mumbai.
170.978	The men that carried that attack out were armed
174.136	with AK-47s, explosives and hand grenades.
177.606	They threw these hand grenades
179.438	at innocent people as they sat eating in cafes
182.638	and waited to catch trains on their way home from work.
187.491	But heavy artillery is nothing new in terrorist operations.
190.844	Guns and bombs are nothing new.
193.248	What was different this time
194.484	is the way that the terrorists used
197.172	modern information communications technologies
199.908	to locate additional victims and slaughter them.
205.264	They were armed with mobile phones.
207.477	They had BlackBerries.
209.076	They had access to satellite imagery.
211.313	They had satellite phones, and they even had night vision goggles.
216.278	But perhaps their greatest innovation was this.
219.265	We've all seen pictures like this
221.353	on television and in the news. This is an operations center.
224.709	And the terrorists built their very own op center
227.136	across the border in Pakistan,
230.567	where they monitored the BBC,
231.848	al Jazeera, CNN and Indian local stations.
236.438	They also monitored the Internet and social media
241.466	to monitor the progress of their attacks
243.588	and how many people they had killed.
245.958	They did all of this in real time.
249.026	The innovation of the terrorist operations center
252.364	gave terrorists unparalleled situational awareness
256.338	and tactical advantage over the police
258.564	and over the government.
261.207	What did they do with this?
262.472	They used it to great effect.
264.448	At one point during the 60-hour siege,
266.497	the terrorists were going room to room
268.16	trying to find additional victims.
271.221	They came upon a suite on the top floor
272.872	of the hotel, and they kicked down the door
274.777	and they found a man hiding by his bed.
277.664	"And they said to him, ""Who are you,"
279.691	"and what are you doing here?"""
281.08	And the man replied,
282.8	"""I'm just an innocent schoolteacher."""
286.474	Of course, the terrorists knew
288.638	that no Indian schoolteacher stays at a suite in the Taj.
292.483	They picked up his identification,
294.075	and they phoned his name in to the terrorist war room,
297.598	where the terrorist war room Googled him,
300.422	and found a picture and called their operatives
303.063	on the ground and said,
304.256	"""Your hostage, is he heavyset?"
308.935	"Is he bald in front? Does he wear glasses?"""
313.413	"""Yes, yes, yes,"" came the answers."
318.019	The op center had found him and they had a match.
320.006	He was not a schoolteacher.
321.373	He was the second-wealthiest businessman in India,
325.247	and after discovering this information,
326.892	the terrorist war room gave the order
329.947	to the terrorists on the ground in Mumbai.
332.573	"(""Kill him."")"
335.699	We all worry about our privacy settings
339.14	on Facebook,
340.876	but the fact of the matter is,
343.301	our openness can be used against us.
346.763	Terrorists are doing this.
348.669	A search engine can determine
352.175	who shall live and who shall die.
356.13	This is the world that we live in.
359.159	During the Mumbai siege,
360.728	terrorists were so dependent on technology
363.354	that several witnesses reported that
365.6	as the terrorists were shooting hostages with one hand,
368.479	they were checking their mobile phone messages
370.855	in the very other hand.
373.31	In the end, 300 people were gravely wounded
376.46	and over 172 men, women and children
380.365	lost their lives that day.
384.716	Think about what happened.
386.481	During this 60-hour siege on Mumbai,
393.907	but with technology,
395.801	were able to bring a city of 20 million people
399.331	to a standstill.
401.493	Ten people brought 20 million people
403.463	to a standstill, and this traveled around the world.
407.657	This is what radicals can do with openness.
413.967	This was done nearly four years ago.
416.485	What could terrorists do today
418.026	with the technologies available that we have?
420.939	What will they do tomorrow?
424.274	The ability of one to affect many
426.653	is scaling exponentially,
429.069	and it's scaling for good and it's scaling for evil.
433.35	It's not just about terrorism, though.
435.604	There's also been a big paradigm shift in crime.
437.914	You see, you can now commit more crime as well.
442.207	In the old days, it was a knife and a gun.
444.487	Then criminals moved to robbing trains.
446.879	You could rob 200 people on a train, a great innovation.
450.519	Moving forward, the Internet
452.22	allowed things to scale even more.
454.388	In fact, many of you will remember
455.94	the recent Sony PlayStation hack.
457.676	In that incident, over 100 million people were robbed.
464.173	Think about that.
465.899	When in the history of humanity
467.365	has it ever been possible for one person
469.567	to rob 100 million?
474.966	Of course, it's not just about stealing things.
476.765	There are other avenues of technology
479.052	that criminals can exploit.
480.497	Many of you will remember this super cute video
483.789	from the last TED,
486.181	but not all quadcopter swarms are so nice and cute.
491.251	They don't all have drumsticks.
493.398	Some can be armed with HD cameras
495.256	and do countersurveillance on protesters,
497.759	or, as in this little bit of movie magic,
500.655	quadcopters can be loaded with firearms
504.358	and automatic weapons.
507.916	Little robots are cute when they play music to you.
510.629	When they swarm and chase you down the block
513.397	to shoot you, a little bit less so.
517.029	Of course, criminals and terrorists weren't the first
519.078	to give guns to robots. We know where that started.
521.916	But they're adapting quickly.
523.252	Recently, the FBI arrested
525.232	an al Qaeda affiliate in the United States,
527.039	who was planning on using these remote-controlled
528.96	drone aircraft to fly C4 explosives
531.887	into government buildings in the United States.
534.496	By the way, these travel at over 600 miles an hour.
539.883	Every time a new technology is being introduced,
542.257	criminals are there to exploit it.
544.898	We've all seen 3D printers.
546.345	We know with them that you can print
547.777	in many materials ranging from plastic
550.609	to chocolate to metal and even concrete.
554.974	With great precision
556.36	I actually was able to make this
558.419	just the other day, a very cute little ducky.
565.343	But I wonder to myself,
567.187	for those people that strap bombs to their chests
574.1	and blow themselves up,
575.181	how might they use 3D printers?
578.938	Perhaps like this.
583.051	You see, if you can print in metal,
585.244	you can print one of these,
588.591	and in fact
594.75	you can also print one of these too.
600.793	The UK I know has some very strict firearms laws.
605.344	You needn't bring the gun into the UK anymore.
607.465	You just bring the 3D printer
609.12	and print the gun while you're here,
611.955	and, of course, the magazines for your bullets.
615.06	But as these get bigger in the future,
616.596	what other items will you be able to print?
618.741	The technologies are allowing bigger printers.
622.029	As we move forward,
623.377	we'll see new technologies also, like the Internet of Things.
626.069	Every day we're connecting more and more of our lives
628.1	to the Internet, which means
630.693	that the Internet of Things will soon be
634.919	the Internet of Things To Be Hacked.
636.683	All of the physical objects in our space
638.706	are being transformed into information technologies,
641.57	and that has a radical implication for our security,
645.125	because more connections to more devices
648.135	means more vulnerabilities.
650.714	Criminals understand this.
652.462	Terrorists understand this. Hackers understand this.
654.341	If you control the code, you control the world.
657.504	This is the future that awaits us.
662.175	There has not yet been an operating system
665.012	or a technology that hasn't been hacked.
667.612	That's troubling, since the human body itself
670.35	is now becoming an information technology.
673.448	As we've seen here, we're transforming ourselves into cyborgs.
677.015	Every year, thousands of cochlear implants,
679.567	diabetic pumps, pacemakers
681.785	and defibrillators are being implanted in people.
684	In the United States, there are 60,000 people
686.648	who have a pacemaker that connects to the Internet.
689.61	The defibrillators allow a physician at a distance
692.974	to give a shock to a heart
694.764	in case a patient needs it.
697.114	But if you don't need it,
699.205	and somebody else gives you the shock,
700.981	it's not a good thing.
704.372	Of course, we're going to go even deeper than the human body.
707.994	We're going down to the cellular level these days.
710.244	Up until this point, all the technologies
712.387	I've been talking about have been silicon-based, ones and zeroes,
716.182	but there's another operating system out there:
718.873	the original operating system, DNA.
723.569	And to hackers, DNA is just another operating system
728.009	waiting to be hacked.
730.008	It's a great challenge for them.
731.504	There are people already working on hacking the software of life,
734.804	and while most of them are doing this to great good
737.761	and to help us all,
739.162	some won't be.
742.698	So how will criminals abuse this?
744.36	Well, with synthetic biology you can do some pretty neat things.
746.643	For example, I predict that we will move away
749.839	from a plant-based narcotics world
752.95	to a synthetic one. Why do you need the plants anymore?
756.009	You can just take the DNA code from marijuana
759.126	or poppies or coca leaves
763.918	and cut and past that gene
766.238	and put it into yeast,
768.915	and you can take those yeast
770.317	and make them make the cocaine for you,
773.589	or the marijuana, or any other drug.
777.373	So how we use yeast in the future
779.157	is going to be really interesting.
781.047	In fact, we may have some really interesting bread and beer
783.391	as we go into this next century.
787.214	The cost of sequencing the human genome is dropping precipitously.
791.212	It was proceeding at Moore's Law pace,
793.6	but then in 2008, something changed.
795.566	The technologies got better,
797.238	and now DNA sequencing is proceeding at a pace
801.084	five times that of Moore's Law.
804.202	That has significant implications for us.
808.026	It took us 30 years to get from
810.769	the introduction of the personal computer
812.925	to the level of cybercrime we have today,
815.154	but looking at how biology is proceeding so rapidly,
818.781	and knowing criminals and terrorists as I do,
820.445	we may get there a lot faster
823.314	with biocrime in the future.
825.183	It will be easy for anybody to go ahead
827.222	and print their own bio-virus,
829.102	enhanced versions of ebola or anthrax,
831.864	weaponized flu.
833.622	We recently saw a case where some researchers
836.411	made the H5N1 avian influenza virus more potent.
841.437	It already has a 70 percent mortality rate
844.903	if you get it, but it's hard to get.
846.493	Engineers, by moving around a small number
849.301	of genetic changes,
850.957	were able to weaponize it
852.656	and make it much more easy for human beings to catch,
855.918	so that not thousands of people would die,
858.101	but tens of millions.
859.814	You see, you can go ahead and create
862.304	new pandemics, and the researchers who did this
864.285	were so proud of their accomplishments,
865.797	they wanted to publish it openly
867.686	so that everybody could see this
869.789	and get access to this information.
873.933	But it goes deeper than that.
875.728	DNA researcher Andrew Hessel
877.67	has pointed out quite rightly
879.067	that if you can use cancer treatments,
881.35	modern cancer treatments,
882.478	to go after one cell while leaving all the other cells
885.427	around it intact,
887.083	then you can also go after any one person's cell.
891.227	Personalized cancer treatments
893.205	are the flip side of personalized bioweapons,
895.819	which means you can attack any one individual,
899.205	including all the people in this picture.
903.388	How will we protect them in the future?
907.516	What to do? What to do about all this?
910.326	That's what I get asked all the time.
912.821	For those of you who follow me on Twitter,
914.408	I will be tweeting out the answer later on today. (Laughter)
918.938	Actually, it's a bit more complex than that,
921.573	and there are no magic bullets.
923.652	I don't have all the answers,
925.364	but I know a few things.
927.028	In the wake of 9/11,
929.725	the best security minds
932.515	put together all their innovation
934.499	and this is what they created for security.
938.638	If you're expecting the people who built this to protect you
942.659	from the coming robopocalypse — (Laughter)
946.375	— uh, you may want to have a backup plan. (Laughter)
949.327	Just saying. Just think about that. (Applause)
955.526	Law enforcement is currently a closed system.
958.445	It's nation-based, while the threat is international.
961.247	Policing doesn't scale globally. At least, it hasn't,
965.195	and our current system of guns, border guards, big gates and fences
969.478	are outdated in the new world into which we're moving.
972.589	So how might we prepare for some of these specific threats,
974.865	like attacking a president or a prime minister?
977.288	This would be the natural government response,
979.425	to hide away all our government leaders
981.702	in hermetically sealed bubbles.
983.513	But this is not going to work.
985.345	The cost of doing a DNA sequence is going to be trivial.
988.481	Anybody will have it and we will all have them in the future.
991.726	So maybe there's a more radical way that we can look at this.
995.183	What happens if we were to take
997.111	the President's DNA, or a king or queen's,
1000.311	and put it out to a group of a few hundred
1002.647	trusted researchers so they could
1004.543	study that DNA and do penetration testing against it
1007.479	as a means of helping our leaders?
1009.687	Or what if we sent it out to a few thousand?
1011.944	Or, controversially, and not without its risks,
1014.606	what happens if we just gave it to the whole public?
1017.465	Then we could all be engaged in helping.
1021.03	We've already seen examples of this working well.
1023.646	The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project
1026.574	is staffed by journalists and citizens
1028.246	where they are crowd-sourcing
1029.982	what dictators and terrorists are doing
1032.595	with public funds around the world,
1034.277	and, in a more dramatic case,
1035.944	we've seen in Mexico,
1038.248	a country that has been racked
1039.872	by 50,000 narcotics-related murders
1043.885	in the past six years.
1045.651	They're killing so many people
1047.026	they can't even afford to bury them all
1049.306	in anything but these unmarked graves
1051.075	like this one outside of Ciudad Juarez.
1054.48	What can we do about this? The government has proven ineffective.
1057.588	So in Mexico, citizens, at great risk to themselves,
1060.725	are fighting back to build an effective solution.
1064.804	They're crowd-mapping the activities of the drug dealers.
1068.988	Whether or not you realize it,
1070.78	we are at the dawn of a technological arms race,
1074.465	an arms race between people
1076.243	who are using technology for good
1078.005	and those who are using it for ill.
1080.213	The threat is serious, and the time to prepare for it is now.
1084.574	I can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are.
1088.007	My personal belief is that,
1090.11	rather than having a small, elite force
1092.055	of highly trained government agents
1094.095	here to protect us all,
1095.816	we're much better off
1097.519	having average and ordinary citizens
1099.598	approaching this problem as a group
1102.022	and seeing what we can do.
1103.335	If we all do our part,
1104.584	I think we'll be in a much better space.
1106.911	The tools to change the world
1108.378	are in everybody's hands.
1110.071	How we use them is not just up to me,
1112.91	it's up to all of us.
1115.392	This was a technology I would frequently deploy
1118.025	as a police officer.
1119.946	This technology has become outdated in our current world.
1123.734	It doesn't scale, it doesn't work globally,
1126.446	and it surely doesn't work virtually.
1128.518	We've seen paradigm shifts in crime and terrorism.
1131.786	They call for a shift to a more open form
1136.133	and a more participatory form of law enforcement.
1141.03	So I invite you to join me.
1143.669	After all, public safety is too important to leave to the professionals.
1148.857	Thank you. (Applause)
1151.664	(Applause)
