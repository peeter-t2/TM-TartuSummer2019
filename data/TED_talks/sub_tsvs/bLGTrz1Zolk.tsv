16.055	So when the White House was built
17.875	in the early 19th century, it was an open house.
20.868	Neighbors came and went. Under President Adams,
24.004	a local dentist happened by.
25.373	He wanted to shake the President's hand.
27.964	The President dismissed the Secretary of State,
30.114	whom he was conferring with, and asked the dentist
32.032	if he would remove a tooth.
33.842	Later, in the 1850s, under President Pierce,
36.9	he was known to have remarked
38.488	— probably the only thing he's known for —
41.057	"when a neighbor passed by and said, ""I'd love to see"
43.808	"the beautiful house,"" and Pierce said to him,"
46.073	"""Why my dear sir, of course you may come in."
48.688	"This isn't my house. It is the people's house."""
52.413	Well, when I got to the White House in the beginning
54.485	of 2009, at the start of the Obama Administration,
57.705	the White House was anything but open.
60.577	Bomb blast curtains covered my windows.
63.105	We were running Windows 2000.
65.284	Social media were blocked at the firewall.
67.467	We didn't have a blog, let alone a dozen twitter accounts
70.007	like we have today.
72.03	I came in to become the head of Open Government,
74.643	to take the values and the practices of transparency,
77.441	participation and collaboration, and instill them
80.854	into the way that we work, to open up government,
83.68	to work with people.
85.2	Now one of the things that we know
87.894	is that companies are very good at getting people to work
90.91	together in teams and in networks to make
93.158	very complex products, like cars and computers,
96.8	and the more complex the products are a society creates,
100.488	the more successful the society is over time.
103.343	Companies make goods, but governments,
106.088	they make public goods. They work on the cure for cancer
109.208	and educating our children and making roads,
112.016	but we don't have institutions that are particularly good
115.657	at this kind of complexity. We don't have institutions
118.193	that are good at bringing our talents to bear,
121.31	at working with us in this kind of open and collaborative way.
125.772	So when we wanted to create our Open Government policy,
128.033	what did we do? We wanted, naturally, to ask public sector
130.609	employees how we should open up government.
133.553	Turns out that had never been done before.
136.785	We wanted to ask members of the public to help us
139.404	come up with a policy, not after the fact, commenting
142.682	on a rule after it's written, the way is typically the case,
146.065	but in advance. There was no legal precedent,
149.385	no cultural precedent, no technical way of doing this.
152.527	In fact, many people told us it was illegal.
155.368	Here's the crux of the obstacle.
158.481	Governments exist to channel the flow of two things,
161.082	really, values and expertise to and from government
164.576	and to and from citizens to the end of making decisions.
168.425	But the way that our institutions are designed,
170.818	in our rather 18th-century, centralized model,
173.869	is to channel the flow of values through voting,
177.553	once every four years, once every two years, at best,
179.753	once a year. This is a rather anemic and thin way, in this
183.314	era of social media, for us to actually express our values.
187.319	Today we have technology that lets us express ourselves
189.931	a great deal, perhaps a little too much.
192.935	Then in the 19th century, we layer on
195.209	the concept of bureaucracy and the administrative state
197.616	to help us govern complex and large societies.
200.759	But we've centralized these bureaucracies.
203.991	We've entrenched them. And we know that
206.436	the smartest person always works for someone else.
209.148	We need to only look around this room to know that
211.828	expertise and intelligence is widely distributed in society,
215.425	and not limited simply to our institutions.
219.596	Scientists have been studying in recent years
221.862	the phenomenon that they often describe as flow,
224.396	that the design of our systems, whether natural or social,
227.66	channel the flow of whatever runs through them.
230.343	So a river is designed to channel the flow of water,
233.62	and the lightning bolt that comes out of a cloud channels
236.09	the flow of electricity, and a leaf is designed to channel
239.594	the flow of nutrients to the tree,
241.614	sometimes even having to route around an obstacle,
244.618	but to get that nutrition flowing.
247.338	The same can be said for our social systems, for our
249.675	systems of government, where, at the very least,
252.163	flow offers us a helpful metaphor for understanding
255.178	what the problem is, what's really broken,
257.834	and the urgent need that we have, that we all feel today,
261.519	to redesign the flow of our institutions.
264.799	We live in a Cambrian era of big data, of social networks,
269.322	and we have this opportunity to redesign these institutions
273.591	that are actually quite recent.
276.476	Think about it: What other business do you know,
279.716	what other sector of the economy, and especially one
282.116	as big as the public sector, that doesn't seek to reinvent
285.903	its business model on a regular basis?
288.807	Sure, we invest plenty in innovation. We invest
291.898	in broadband and science education and science grants,
295.862	but we invest far too little in reinventing and redesigning
299.213	the institutions that we have.
301.813	Now, it's very easy to complain, of course, about
304.149	partisan politics and entrenched bureaucracy, and we love
307.613	to complain about government. It's a perennial pastime,
310.529	especially around election time, but
313.181	the world is complex. We soon will have 10 billion people,
316.567	many of whom will lack basic resources.
319.44	So complain as we might, what actually can replace
322.758	what we have today?
325.069	What comes the day after the Arab Spring?
329.176	Well, one attractive alternative that obviously presents itself
333.062	to us is that of networks. Right? Networks
335.822	like Facebook and Twitter. They're lean. They're mean.
338.534	You've got 3,000 employees at Facebook
341.038	governing 900 million inhabitants.
343.984	We might even call them citizens, because they've recently
346.727	risen up to fight against legislative incursion,
350.102	and the citizens of these networks work together
352.637	to serve each other in great ways.
355.878	But private communities, private, corporate,
358.67	privatizing communities, are not bottom-up democracies.
361.81	They cannot replace government.
363.82	Friending someone on Facebook is not complex enough
366.922	to do the hard work of you and I collaborating
369.575	with each other and doing the hard work of governance.
373.467	But social media do teach us something.
376.405	Why is Twitter so successful? Because it opens up its platform.
380.879	It opens up the API to allow hundreds of thousands
383.816	of new applications to be built on top of it, so that we can
387.287	read and process information in new and exciting ways.
391.621	We need to think about how to open up the API
393.958	of government, and the way that we're going to do that,
398.019	the next great superpower is going to be the one
401.267	who can successfully combine the hierarchy of institution --
407.25	because we have to maintain those public values,
409.603	we have to coordinate the flow -- but with the diversity
412.522	and the pulsating life and the chaos and the excitement
415.187	of networks, all of us working together to build
418.283	these new innovations on top of our institutions,
421.984	to engage in the practice of governance.
424.202	We have a precedent for this. Good old Henry II here,
427.335	in the 12th century, invented the jury.
431.187	Powerful, practical, palpable model for handing power
435.412	from government to citizens.
438.113	Today we have the opportunity, and we have
441.501	the imperative, to create thousands of new ways
445.002	of interconnecting between networks and institutions,
448.241	thousands of new kinds of juries: the citizen jury,
450.905	the Carrotmob, the hackathon, we are just beginning
454.582	to invent the models by which we can cocreate
457.636	the process of governance.
459.384	Now, we don't fully have a picture of what this will look like
461.999	yet, but we're seeing pockets of evolution
464.621	emerging all around us -- maybe not even evolution,
467.603	I'd even start to call it a revolution -- in the way that we govern.
471.412	Some of it's very high-tech,
472.896	and some of it is extremely low-tech,
474.95	such as the project that MKSS is running in Rajasthan,
478.32	India, where they take the spending data of the state
481.864	and paint it on 100,000 village walls,
485.307	and then invite the villagers to come and comment
487.602	who is on the government payroll, who's actually died,
490.09	what are the bridges that have been built to nowhere,
492.714	and to work together through civic engagement to save
495.058	real money and participate and have access to that budget.
498.821	But it's not just about policing government.
501.219	It's also about creating government.
502.946	Spacehive in the U.K. is engaging in crowd-funding,
506.064	getting you and me to raise the money to build
508.749	the goalposts and the park benches that will actually
511.407	allow us to deliver better services in our communities.
514.969	No one is better at this activity of actually getting us
518.607	to engage in delivering services,
521.847	sometimes where none exist, than Ushahidi.
524.998	Created after the post-election riots in Kenya in 2008,
529.351	this crisis-mapping website and community is actually able
533.287	to crowdsource and target the delivery of
535.932	better rescue services to people trapped under the rubble,
539.023	whether it's after the earthquakes in Haiti,
541.479	or more recently in Italy.
544.004	And the Red Cross too is training volunteers and Twitter
547.135	is certifying them, not simply to supplement existing
550.003	government institutions, but in many cases, to replace them.
554.039	Now what we're seeing lots of examples of, obviously,
557.047	is the opening up of government data,
558.734	not enough examples of this yet, but we're starting
561.734	to see this practice of people creating and generating
565.263	innovative applications on top of government data.
568.732	There's so many examples I could have picked, and I
571.063	selected this one of Jon Bon Jovi. Some of you
574.229	may or may not know that he runs a soup kitchen
576.495	in New Jersey, where he caters to and serves the homeless
579.256	and particularly homeless veterans.
580.949	In February, he approached the White House, and said,
583.727	"""I would like to fund a prize to create scalable national"
587.572	applications, apps, that will help not only the homeless
591.099	"but those who deliver services [to] them to do so better."""
594.534	February 2012 to June of 2012,
597.774	the finalists are announced in the competition.
600.762	Can you imagine, in the bureaucratic world of yesteryear,
603.751	getting anything done in a four-month period of time?
606.497	You can barely fill out the forms in that amount of time,
608.633	let alone generate real, palpable innovations
611.497	that improve people's lives.
613.388	And I want to be clear to mention that this open government
616.621	revolution is not about privatizing government,
620.398	because in many cases what it can do when we have
623.296	the will to do so is to deliver more progressive
626.392	and better policy than the regulations and the legislative
630.515	and litigation-oriented strategies
633.475	by which we make policy today.
636.075	In the State of Texas, they regulate 515 professions,
639.802	from well-driller to florist.
641.866	Now, you can carry a gun into a church in Dallas,
645.089	but do not make a flower arrangement without a license,
648.248	because that will land you in jail.
650.864	So what is Texas doing? They're asking you and me,
654.881	using online policy wikis, to help not simply get rid of
658.969	burdensome regulations that impede entrepreneurship,
662.53	but to replace those regulations with more innovative
665.529	alternatives, sometimes using transparency in the creation
668.393	of new iPhone apps that will allows us
670.375	both to protect consumers and the public
672.648	and to encourage economic development.
676.159	That is a nice sideline of open government.
679.313	It's not only the benefits that we've talked about with regard
682.024	to development. It's the economic benefits and the
685.481	job creation that's coming from this open innovation work.
690.107	Sberbank, the largest and oldest bank in Russia,
692.927	largely owned by the Russian government,
694.727	has started practicing crowdsourcing, engaging
697.727	its employees and citizens in the public in developing innovations.
701.079	Last year they saved a billion dollars, 30 billion rubles,
705.499	from open innovation, and they're pushing radically
708.256	the extension of crowdsourcing, not only from banking,
710.915	but into the public sector.
712.958	And we see lots of examples of these innovators using
715.699	open government data, not simply to make apps,
718.549	but then to make companies and to hire people
720.611	to build them working with the government.
722.912	So a lot of these innovations are local.
725.042	In San Ramon, California, they published an iPhone app
728.148	in which they allow you or me to say we are certified
731.705	CPR-trained, and then when someone has a heart attack,
735.272	a notification goes out so that you
737.512	can rush over to the person over here and deliver CPR.
741.468	The victim who receives bystander CPR
743.772	is more than twice as likely to survive.
746.237	"""There is a hero in all of us,"" is their slogan."
749.912	But it's not limited to the local.
752.455	British Columbia, Canada, is publishing a catalogue
755.116	of all the ways that its residents and citizens can engage
758.2	with the state in the cocreation of governance.
761.918	Let me be very clear,
764.979	and perhaps controversial,
766.448	that open government is not
769.237	about transparent government.
771.21	Simply throwing data over the transom doesn't change
774.128	how government works.
775.54	It doesn't get anybody to do anything with that data
778.107	to change lives, to solve problems, and it doesn't change
781.816	government.
783.088	What it does is it creates an adversarial relationship
786.107	between civil society and government
787.835	over the control and ownership of information.
790.878	And transparency, by itself, is not reducing the flow
793.462	of money into politics, and arguably,
795.874	it's not even producing accountability as well as it might
798.607	if we took the next step of combining participation and
802.07	collaboration with transparency to transform how we work.
806.181	We're going to see this evolution really in two phases,
808.918	I think. The first phase of the open government revolution
812.207	is delivering better information from the crowd
815.983	into the center.
817.377	Starting in 2005, and this is how this open government
820.324	work in the U.S. really got started,
822.278	I was teaching a patent law class to my students and
824.534	explaining to them how a single person in the bureaucracy
828.305	has the power to make a decision
830.436	about which patent application becomes the next patent,
834.921	and therefore monopolizes for 20 years the rights
837.663	over an entire field of inventive activity.
840.67	Well, what did we do? We said, we can make a website,
843.582	we can make an expert network, a social network,
845.975	that would connect the network to the institution
848.247	to allow scientists and technologists to get
850.628	better information to the patent office
853.263	to aid in making those decisions.
855.726	We piloted the work in the U.S. and the U.K. and Japan
858.358	and Australia, and now I'm pleased to report
861.151	that the United States Patent Office will be rolling out
863.407	universal, complete, and total openness,
867.872	so that all patent applications will now be open
870.918	for citizen participation, beginning this year.
874.586	The second phase of this evolution — Yeah. (Applause)
877.522	They deserve a hand. (Applause)
880.475	The first phase is in getting better information in.
883.01	The second phase is in getting decision-making power out.
886.867	Participatory budgeting has long been practiced
889.482	in Porto Alegre, Brazil.
890.901	They're just starting it in the 49th Ward in Chicago.
893.883	Russia is using wikis to get citizens writing law together,
897.419	as is Lithuania. When we start to see
899.771	power over the core functions of government
902.075	— spending, legislation, decision-making —
905.695	then we're well on our way to an open government revolution.
909.756	There are many things that we can do to get us there.
913.587	Obviously opening up the data is one,
916.25	but the important thing is to create lots more --
918.613	create and curate -- lots more participatory opportunities.
922.843	Hackathons and mashathons and working with data
925.541	to build apps is an intelligible way for people to engage
929.25	and participate, like the jury is,
931.75	but we're going to need lots more things like it.
934.774	And that's why we need to start with our youngest people.
939.425	We've heard talk here at TED about people
942.041	biohacking and hacking their plants with Arduino,
946.11	and Mozilla is doing work around the world in getting
949.154	young people to build websites and make videos.
952.513	When we start by teaching young people that we live,
955.249	not in a passive society, a read-only society,
958.767	but in a writable society, where we have the power
961.334	to change our communities, to change our institutions,
964.958	that's when we begin to really put ourselves on the pathway
968.094	towards this open government innovation,
971.305	towards this open government movement,
973.014	towards this open government revolution.
975.537	So let me close by saying that I think the important thing
977.783	for us to do is to talk about and demand this revolution.
983.642	We don't have words, really, to describe it yet.
986.937	Words like equality and fairness and the traditional
989.162	elections, democracy, these are not really great terms yet.
993.529	They're not fun enough. They're not exciting enough
996.277	to get us engaged in this tremendous opportunity
999.596	that awaits us. But I would argue that if we want to see
1003.004	the kinds of innovations, the hopeful and exciting
1005.707	innovations that we hear talked about here at TED,
1008.371	in clean energy, in clean education,
1010.548	in development, if we want to see those adopted
1013.139	and we want to see those scaled,
1015.395	we want to see them become the governance of tomorrow,
1018.187	then we must all participate,
1019.892	then we must get involved.
1021.39	We must open up our institutions, and like the leaf,
1024.6	we must let the nutrients flow throughout our body politic,
1028.794	throughout our culture, to create open institutions
1031.994	to create a stronger democracy, a better tomorrow.
1034.663	Thank you. (Applause)
