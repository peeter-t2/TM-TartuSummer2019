12.924	Carlos,
14.477	the Vietnam vet Marine
16.054	who volunteered for three tours
16.054	and got shot up in every one.
20.65	In 1971, he was medically retired
22.776	because he had so much
22.776	shrapnel in his body
25.099	that he was setting off metal detectors.
28.279	For the next 42 years,
28.279	he suffered from nightmares,
31.404	extreme anxiety in public,
33.642	isolation, depression.
35.677	He self-medicated with alcohol.
37.605	He was married and divorced three times.
40.535	Carlos had post-traumatic stress disorder.
44.129	Now, I became a psychologist
44.129	to help mitigate human suffering,
47.73	and for the past 10 years, my target
47.73	has been the suffering caused by PTSD,
52.241	as experienced by veterans like Carlos.
55.356	Until recently, the science of PTSD
55.356	just wasn't there.
61.161	And so, we didn't know what to do.
63.561	We put some veterans on heavy drugs.
65.949	Others we hospitalized
65.949	and gave generic group therapy,
68.777	and others still we simply said to them,
70.899	"""Just go home and try to forget"
70.899	"about your experiences."""
75.534	More recently, we've tried therapy dogs,
75.534	wilderness retreats --
78.901	many things which may
78.901	temporarily relieve stress,
81.846	but which don't actually eliminate
81.846	PTSD symptoms over the long term.
86.654	But things have changed.
88.451	And I am here to tell you
88.451	that we can now eliminate PTSD,
93.631	not just manage the symptoms,
95.482	and in huge numbers of veterans.
97.054	Because new scientific research
97.054	has been able to show,
100.056	objectively, repeatedly,
102.458	which treatments actually
102.458	get rid of symptoms and which do not.
105.957	Now as it turns out,
107.629	the best treatments for PTSD use
107.629	many of the very same training principles
112.883	that the military uses
112.883	in preparing its trainees for war.
118.227	Now, making war --
120.254	this is something that we are good at.
122.993	We humans have been making war
122.993	since before we were even fully human.
128.006	And since then, we have gone
128.006	from using stone and sinew
131.494	to developing the most sophisticated
131.494	and devastating weapon systems imaginable.
136.108	And to enable our warriors
136.108	to use these weapons,
138.467	we employ the most cutting-edge
138.467	training methods.
140.812	We are good at making war.
142.898	And we are good at training
142.898	our warriors to fight.
146.687	Yet, when we consider the experience
146.687	of the modern-day combat veteran,
150.2	we begin to see that we
150.2	have not been as good
153.411	at preparing them to come home.
155.447	Why is that?
157.731	Well, our ancestors lived
157.731	immersed in conflict,
161.029	and they fought right where they lived.
164.094	So until only very recently
164.094	in our evolutionary history,
167.132	there was hardly a need to learn
167.132	how to come home from war,
170.048	because we never really did.
173.377	But thankfully, today,
174.643	most of humanity lives
174.643	in far more peaceful societies,
177.682	and when there is conflict,
177.682	we, especially in the United States,
181.685	now have the technology to put
181.685	our warriors through advanced training,
185.206	drop them in to fight
185.206	anywhere on the globe
188.047	and when they're done,
189.53	jet them back to peacetime suburbia.
192.514	But just imagine for a moment
192.514	what this must feel like.
197.064	I've spoken with veterans who've told me
199.108	that one day they're in a brutal
199.108	firefight in Afghanistan
202.224	where they saw carnage and death,
205.867	and just three days later,
205.867	they found themselves
208.361	toting an ice chest
208.361	to their kid's soccer game.
212.405	"""Mindfuck"" is the most common term."
215.194	(Laughter)
216.632	It's the most common term
216.632	I've heard to describe that experience.
219.775	And that's exactly what that is.
221.323	Because while our warriors
221.323	spend countless hours training for war,
225.336	we've only recently come to understand
227.253	that many require training
227.253	on how to return to civilian life.
231.642	Now, like any training, the best
231.642	PTSD treatments require repetition.
235.757	In the military,
236.932	we don't simply hand trainees
236.932	Mark-19 automatic grenade launchers
240.196	"and say, ""Here's the trigger,"
240.196	"here's some ammo and good luck."""
243.412	No. We train them, on the range
243.412	and in specific contexts,
248.132	over and over and over
249.842	until lifting their weapon
249.842	and engaging their target
252.655	is so engrained into muscle memory
254.515	that it can be performed
254.515	without even thinking,
256.867	even under the most stressful
256.867	conditions you can imagine.
260.63	Now, the same holds
260.63	for training-based treatments.
263.875	The first of these treatments
263.875	is cognitive therapy,
267.23	and this is a kind
267.23	of mental recalibration.
271.166	When veterans come home from war,
272.819	their way of mentally framing
272.819	the world is calibrated
275.439	to an immensely
275.439	more dangerous environment.
278.86	So when you try to overlay that mind frame
278.86	onto a peacetime environment,
284.04	you get problems.
285.269	You begin drowning in worries
285.269	about dangers that aren't present.
289.748	You begin not trusting family or friends.
293.935	Which is not to say there are no
293.935	dangers in civilian life; there are.
298.402	It's just that the probability
298.402	of encountering them
301.118	compared to combat
302.412	is astronomically lower.
305.675	So we never advise veterans
305.675	to turn off caution completely.
308.839	We do train them, however,
308.839	to adjust caution
311.247	according to where they are.
313.685	If you find yourself
313.685	in a bad neighborhood,
316.194	you turn it up.
317.878	Out to dinner with family?
319.551	You turn it way down.
321.975	We train veterans to be fiercely rational,
325.271	to systematically gauge
325.271	the actual statistical probability
328.849	of encountering, say, an IED
328.849	here in peacetime America.
333.46	With enough practice,
333.46	those recalibrations stick.
339.193	The next of these treatments
339.193	is exposure therapy,
341.531	and this is a kind of field training,
344.453	and the fastest of the proven
344.453	effective treatments out there.
347.974	You remember Carlos?
349.555	This was the treatment that he chose.
351.869	And so we started off
351.869	by giving him exercises,
354.333	for him, challenging ones:
355.663	going to a grocery store,
357.633	going to a shopping mall,
357.633	going to a restaurant,
360.282	sitting with his back to the door.
363.214	And, critically --
365.032	staying in these environments.
367.791	Now, at first he was very anxious.
369.525	He wanted to sit
369.525	where he could scan the room,
372.041	where he could plan escape routes,
373.99	where he could get his hands
373.99	on a makeshift weapon.
377.041	And he wanted to leave, but he didn't.
380.39	He remembered his training
380.39	in the Marine Corps,
383.285	and he pushed through his discomfort.
385.53	And every time he did this,
385.53	his anxiety ratcheted down a little bit,
388.746	and then a little bit more
388.746	and then a little bit more,
391.529	until in the end,
392.867	he had effectively relearned
392.867	how to sit in a public space
398.785	and just enjoy himself.
401.704	He also listened to recordings
401.704	of his combat experiences,
405.046	over and over and over.
407.706	He listened until those memories
407.706	no longer generated any anxiety.
412.419	He processed his memories so much
415.005	that his brain no longer needed
415.005	to return to those experiences
418.258	in his sleep.
420.4	And when I spoke with him
420.4	a year after treatment had finished,
423.977	he told me,
425.372	"""Doc, this is the first time in 43 years"
430.472	"that I haven't had nightmares."""
433.412	Now, this is different
433.412	than erasing a memory.
438.087	Veterans will always remember
438.087	their traumatic experiences,
441.106	but with enough practice,
442.787	those memories are no longer as raw
442.787	or as painful as they once were.
448.379	They don't feel emotionally
448.379	like they just happened yesterday,
451.964	and that is an immensely
451.964	better place to be.
457.985	But it's often difficult.
459.677	And, like any training,
459.677	it may not work for everybody.
464.117	And there are trust issues.
465.931	Sometimes I'm asked,
467.237	"""If you haven't been there, Doc,"
467.237	"how can you help me?"""
469.915	Which is understandable.
472.244	But at the point of returning
472.244	to civilian life,
476.639	you do not require
476.639	somebody who's been there.
479.985	You don't require training
479.985	for operations on the battlefield;
483.125	you require training on how to come home.
490.626	For the past 10 years of my work,
493.336	I have been exposed to detailed accounts
496.108	of the worst experiences
496.108	that you can imagine,
498.732	daily.
499.985	And it hasn't always been easy.
502.107	There have been times
502.107	where I have just felt my heart break
505.496	or that I've absorbed too much.
508.15	But these training-based
508.15	treatments work so well,
511.497	that whatever this work takes out of me,
511.497	it puts back even more,
514.603	because I see people get better.
518.754	I see people's lives transform.
522.656	Carlos can now enjoy outings
522.656	with his grandchildren,
526.018	which is something he couldn't even do
526.018	with his own children.
529.638	And what's amazing to me
529.638	is that after 43 years of suffering,
533.648	it only took him 10 weeks
533.648	of intense training to get his life back.
538.001	And when I spoke with him, he told me,
540.333	"""I know that I can't get those years back."
545.088	But at least now, whatever days
545.088	that I have left on this Earth,
550.021	"I can live them in peace."""
553.114	"He also said, ""I hope that these"
553.114	younger veterans don't wait
556.61	"to get the help they need."""
558.588	And that's my hope, too.
561.02	Because ...
563.003	this life is short,
565.383	and if you are fortunate enough
565.383	to have survived war
568.579	or any kind of traumatic experience,
570.683	you owe it to yourself
570.683	to live your life well.
574.629	And you shouldn't wait
574.629	to get the training you need
577.294	to make that happen.
580.663	Now, the best way of ending
580.663	human suffering caused by war
586.883	is to never go to war.
589.422	But we are just not there
589.422	yet as a species.
592.157	Until we are,
593.441	the mental suffering that we create
593.441	in our sons and in our daughters
598.698	when we send them off to fight
600.682	can be alleviated.
603.675	But we must ensure that the science,
603.675	the energy level, the value
609.785	that we place on sending them off to war
613.516	is at the very least mirrored
615.45	in how well we prepare them
615.45	to come back home to us.
619.868	This much, we owe them.
622.186	Thank you.
623.393	(Applause)
