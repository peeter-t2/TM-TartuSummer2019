16.794	There are more Chinese
16.794	restaurants in this country
19.16	than McDonald's, Burger King, Kentucky
19.16	Fried Chicken and Wendy's, combined --
24.821	Chinese restaurants have played
24.821	an important role in American history,
28.173	as a matter of fact.
29.376	The Cuban missile crisis was resolved
29.376	in a Chinese restaurant
32.261	called Yenching Palace in Washington, DC,
34.293	which unfortunately is closed now,
35.951	and about to be turned into Walgreen's.
37.84	And the house where John Wilkes Booth
39.675	planned the assassination
39.675	of Abraham Lincoln
41.977	is also now a Chinese restaurant
41.977	called Wok and Roll,
45.12	on H Street in Washington.
46.383	(Laughter)
49.667	And it's not completely gratuitous,
51.362	"because ""wok"" and ""roll"" --"
51.362	Chinese food and Japanese foods,
54.363	so it kind of works out.
55.552	And Americans love
55.552	their Chinese food so much,
57.798	they've actually brought it into space.
59.757	NASA, for example, serves
59.757	thermostabilized sweet-and-sour pork
63.392	on its shuttle menu for its astronauts.
66.675	So, let me present the question to you:
68.93	If our benchmark
68.93	for Americanness is apple pie,
71.578	you should ask yourself:
71.578	how often do you eat apple pie,
74.239	versus how often do you eat Chinese food?
76.239	(Laughter)
80.862	And if you think about it,
83.655	a lot of the foods that we or Americans
83.655	think of as Chinese food
88.631	are barely recognizable to Chinese.
90.79	For example: beef with broccoli,
90.79	egg rolls, General Tso's Chicken,
94.853	fortune cookies, chop suey,
94.853	the take-out boxes.
97.933	For example, I took a whole bunch
97.933	of fortune cookies back to China,
101.105	gave them to Chinese
101.105	to see how they would react.
103.557	[What is this?]
104.848	[Should I try it?]
106.256	[Try it!]
110.191	[What is this called?]
112.08	[Fortune cookie.]
114.935	(Laughter)
118.16	[There's a piece of paper inside!]
121.059	(Laughter)
124.754	[What is this?]
127.516	[You've won a prize!]
132.104	[What is this?]
134.289	[It's a fortune!]
139.326	[Tasty!]
141.986	So where are they from?
143.345	The short answer is, actually,
143.345	they're from Japan.
146.734	And in Kyoto, outside, there are still
146.734	small family-run bakeries
150.33	that make fortune cookies,
150.33	as they did over 100 years ago,
	were introduced in the United States.
157.864	If you see them side by side,
159.511	there's yellow and brown.
160.814	Theirs are actually flavored
160.814	with miso and sesame paste,
163.528	so they're not as sweet as our version.
165.567	So how did they get to the US?
167.184	Well, the short answer is,
167.184	the Japanese immigrants came over,
170.16	and a bunch of the bakers
170.16	introduced them --
172.642	including at least one in Los Angeles,
174.642	and one here in San Francisco,
174.642	called Benkyodo,
177.159	which is on the corner
177.159	of Sutter and Buchanan.
179.329	Back then, they made fortune cookies
179.329	using very much the similar kind of irons
184.16	that we saw back in Kyoto.
185.933	The interesting question is:
187.346	How do you go from fortune cookies
187.346	being something that is Japanese
190.781	to being something that is Chinese?
192.528	Well, we locked up all the Japanese
192.528	during World War II,
195.675	including those that made fortune cookies.
197.768	So that's when the Chinese moved in,
199.595	saw a market opportunity and took over.
201.555	(Laughter)
203.205	So, fortune cookies:
203.205	invented by the Japanese,
205.591	popularized by the Chinese,
206.926	but ultimately consumed by Americans.
208.779	They're more American than anything else.
210.763	Another of my favorite dishes:
212.228	General Tso's Chicken --
212.228	which, by the way, in the US Naval Academy
215.409	is called Admiral Tso's Chicken.
216.961	(Laughter)
217.991	I love this dish.
219.167	The original name of my book
219.167	"was ""The Long March of General Tso."""
222.252	And he has marched very far indeed,
223.963	because he is sweet, he is fried,
223.963	and he is chicken --
227.03	all things that Americans love.
228.812	(Laughter)
230.495	He has marched so far, actually,
232.063	that the chef who originally
232.063	invented the dish
234.252	doesn't recognize it;
234.252	he's kind of horrified.
237.093	Video: (In Chinese)
245.696	Audience: (Laughter)
247.579	He's in Taiwan right now.
249.16	He's retired, deaf
249.16	and plays a lot of mah–jongg.
251.605	After I showed him this, he got up,
254.898	"and says, ""mòmíngqímiào,"""
254.898	"which means, ""This is all nonsense,"""
257.915	and goes back to play his mah-jongg
257.915	game during the afternoon.
261.358	Another dish, one of my favorites:
261.358	beef with broccoli.
264.894	Broccoli is not a Chinese vegetable;
268.08	in fact, it is originally
268.08	an Italian vegetable.
270.825	It was introduced into
270.825	the United States in the 1800s,
273.824	but became popularized
273.824	in the 1920s and the 1930s.
276.725	The Chinese have their own version
276.725	of broccoli, called Chinese broccoli,
280.198	but they've now discovered
280.198	American broccoli,
282.641	and are importing it
282.641	as a sort of exotic delicacy.
286.55	I guarantee you, General Tso
286.55	never saw a stalk of broccoli in his life.
290.663	That was a picture of General Tso.
292.89	I went to his home town.
294.16	This is a billboard that says:
295.637	"""Welcome to the birthplace"
295.637	"of General Tso."""
297.677	And I went looking for chicken.
299.896	Finally found a cow --
301.366	and did find chicken.
304.136	Believe it or not, these guys
304.136	were actually crossing the road.
307.12	(Laughter)
310.766	And I found a whole bunch
310.766	of General Tso's relatives
313.276	who are still in the town.
314.585	This guy is now five generations
314.585	removed from the General;
317.372	this guy is about seven.
318.602	I showed them the pictures
318.602	of General Tso Chicken,
321.452	and they were like,
322.646	"""We don't know this dish."
322.646	"Is this Chinese food?"""
324.933	Because it doesn't look
324.933	like Chinese food to them.
327.384	But they weren't surprised I traveled
327.384	around the world to visit them,
331.664	because in their eyes he is, after all,
333.902	a famous Qing dynasty military hero.
335.666	He played an important role
335.666	in the Taiping Rebellion,
338.184	a war started by a guy
338.184	who thought he was the son of God
340.832	and baby brother of Jesus Christ.
342.446	He caused a war that killed
344.76	still the deadliest civil war
344.76	in the world to this day.
348.858	So, you know, I realized when I was there,
351.078	General Tso is kind of a lot
351.078	like Colonel Sanders in America,
354.079	in that he's known
354.079	for chicken and not war.
356.631	But in China, this guy's actually known
356.631	for war and not chicken.
360.787	But the granddaddy
360.787	of all the Chinese American dishes
363.312	we probably ought to talk
363.312	about is chop suey,
366.256	which was introduced
366.256	around the turn of the 20th century.
370.101	According to the New York Times in 1904,
372.05	there was an outbreak
372.05	of Chinese restaurants all over town,
374.937	"and ""... the city has gone"
374.937	"'chop suey' mad."""
377.88	So it took about 30 years
377.88	before the Americans realized
381.597	that chop suey is actually
381.597	not known in China,
384.16	and as this article points out,
386.101	"""The average native of any city in China"
386.101	"knows nothing of chop suey."""
390.712	Back then it was a way to show
390.712	you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan;
394.121	a guy who wanted to impress a girl
394.121	could take her on a chop suey date.
397.816	I like to say chop suey
397.816	is the biggest culinary joke
400.293	one culture ever played on another,
402.004	"because ""chop suey,"""
402.004	translated into Chinese,
404.147	"means ""jaahp-seui,"" which, translated"
404.147	"back, means ""odds and ends."""
407.287	So, these people are going
407.287	around China asking for chop suey,
410.684	which is sort of like a Japanese guy
410.684	coming here and saying,
413.557	"""I understand you have"
413.557	a very popular dish in your country
416.325	"called 'leftovers.'"""
417.653	(Laughter)
419.889	Right?
421.064	(Laughter)
423.24	And not only that:
425.462	"""This dish is particularly popular"
427.129	after that holiday
427.129	"you call 'Thanksgiving.'"""
429.245	(Laughter)
430.271	So, why and where did chop suey come from?
433.377	Let's go back to the mid-1800s,
436.598	when the Chinese first came to America.
438.534	Back then, Americans were not
438.534	clamoring to eat Chinese food.
441.965	In fact, they saw these people
441.965	who landed at their shores as alien.
447.061	These people weren't eating dogs,
447.061	they were eating cats.
449.718	If they weren't eating cats,
449.718	they were eating rats.
452.125	In fact, The New York Times,
452.125	my esteemed employer,
454.499	in 1883 ran an article that asked,
456.147	"""Do Chinese eat rats?"""
457.322	Not the most PC question
457.322	to be asked today,
461.696	but if you look at the popular
461.696	imagery of the time,
464.131	not so outlandish.
465.571	This is actually a real
465.571	advertisement for rat poison
470.551	from the late 1800s.
471.782	And if you see under the word
471.782	"""Clears"" -- very small --"
474.464	"it says, ""They must go,"""
474.464	which refers not only to the rats,
477.274	but to the Chinese in their midst,
479.275	because the way
479.275	that the food was perceived
482.352	was that these people who ate
482.352	foods different from us
485.448	must be different from us.
486.726	Another way that you saw
486.726	this antipathy towards the Chinese
490.128	is through documents like this.
491.641	This is in the Library of Congress.
493.336	It's a pamphlet published
493.336	by Samuel Gompers,
495.423	hero of our American labor movement.
497.185	"It's called, ""Some Reason"
497.185	for Chinese Exclusion:
499.816	Meat versus Rice: American Manhood
499.816	against Asiatic Coolieism:
503.524	"Which shall survive?"""
504.699	And it basically made the argument
506.5	that Chinese men who ate rice
508.557	would necessarily bring down
508.557	the standard of living
510.963	for American men who ate meat.
512.772	And as a matter of fact, then,
514.234	this is one of the reasons
514.234	we must exclude them from this country.
517.358	So, with sentiments like these,
519.16	the Chinese Exclusion Act
519.16	was passed between 1882 and 1902,
525.16	the only time in American history
527.16	when a group was specifically excluded
529.092	for its national origin or ethnicity.
532.527	So in a way, because
532.527	the Chinese were attacked,
534.944	chop suey was created
534.944	as a defense mechanism.
538.117	Who came up with the idea of chop suey?
540.16	There's a lot of different
540.16	mysteries and legends,
542.482	but of the ones I've found,
543.979	the most interesting
543.979	is this article from 1904.
546.908	A Chinese guy named Lem Sen
548.223	shows up in Chinatown,
548.223	New York City, and says,
550.454	"""I want you all to stop making chop suey,"
552.445	because I am the original creator
552.445	and sole proprietor of chop suey.
555.999	And the way he tells it,
557.404	there was a famous Chinese
557.404	diplomat that showed up,
562.417	and he was told to make a dish
562.417	that looked very popular
565.052	"and could, quote, ""pass"" as Chinese."
566.814	And as he said --
566.814	we would never print this today --
569.51	but basically, the American man
569.51	has become very rich.
573.281	"Lem Sen: ""I would've made this money, too,"
573.281	but I spent all this time
576.576	looking for the American man
576.576	who stole my recipe.
578.893	Now I've found him
578.893	and I want my recipe back,
581.019	and I want everyone
581.019	to stop making chop suey,
583.17	or pay me for the right to do the same.
585.067	So it was an early exercise
585.067	of intellectual property rights.
588.756	The thing is, this idea
588.756	of Chinese-American food
592.16	doesn't exist only in America.
595.288	In fact, Chinese food
595.288	is the most pervasive food on the planet,
598.313	served on all seven continents,
598.313	even Antarctica,
601.312	because Monday night is Chinese
601.312	food night at McMurdo Station,
604.292	which is the main scientific
604.292	station in Antarctica.
607.435	You see different varieties
607.435	of Chinese food.
609.51	For example, there is French Chinese food,
611.592	where they serve
611.592	salt and pepper frog legs.
614.565	There is Italian Chinese food,
614.565	where they don't have fortune cookies,
618.576	so they serve fried gelato.
619.888	My neighbor, Alessandra,
619.888	was shocked when I told her,
622.686	"""Dude, fried gelato is not Chinese."""
624.642	"She's like, ""It's not? But they serve it"
624.642	"in all the Chinese restaurants in Italy."""
628.672	(Laughter)
632.386	Even the Brits have their own version.
634.226	This is a dish called
634.226	"""crispy shredded beef,"""
636.501	which has a lot of crisp, a lot of shred,
636.501	and not a lot of beef.
639.701	There is West Indian Chinese food,
639.701	there's Jamaican Chinese food,
642.818	Middle Eastern Chinese food,
642.818	Mauritian Chinese food.
645.92	"This is a dish called ""Magic Bowl,"""
645.92	that I discovered.
648.666	There's Indian Chinese food,
648.666	Korean Chinese food,
651.16	Japanese Chinese food,
652.668	where they take the bao, the little buns,
652.668	and make them into pizza versions.
656.661	(Laughter)
657.8	And they totally randomly
657.8	take Chinese noodle dishes,
661.001	and just ramenize them.
662.233	This is something that,
662.233	in the Chinese version, has no soup.
665.471	So, there's Peruvian Chinese food,
667.458	which should not be mixed
667.458	with Mexican Chinese food,
669.937	where they basically take things
669.937	and make it look like fajitas.
672.934	(Laughter)
673.96	And they have things
673.96	like risotto chop suey.
676.044	My personal favorite
676.044	of all the restaurants
678.14	I've encountered around the world
679.751	was this one in Brazil,
679.751	"called ""Kung Food."""
681.815	(Laughter)
685.45	So, let's take a step back and understand
688.723	what is to be appreciated in America.
691.319	McDonald's has garnered
691.319	a lot of attention, a lot of respect,
696.602	for basically standardizing the menu,
696.602	decor and dining experience
702.176	in post-World War II America.
703.75	But you know what?
705.014	They did so through a centralized
705.014	headquarters out of Illinois.
708.178	Chinese restaurants have done largely
708.178	the same thing, I would argue,
711.414	with the menu and the decor,
711.414	even the restaurant name,
713.986	but without a centralized headquarters.
715.877	So, this actually became very clear to me
718.242	with the March 30, 2005 Powerball drawing,
721.025	where they expected, based
721.025	on the number of ticket sales they had,
724.16	to have three or four
724.16	second-place winners,
726.205	people who match
726.205	five or six Powerball numbers.
728.449	Instead, they had 110,
728.449	and they were completely shocked.
731.112	They looked all across the country
731.112	and discovered it couldn't be fraud,
734.497	since it happened in different states,
734.497	across different computer systems.
738.003	Whatever it was, it caused people
738.003	to behave in a mass-synchronized way.
741.392	So, OK, maybe it had to do
741.392	with the patterns on the pieces of paper,
745.517	like it was a diamond, or diagonal.
748.447	It wasn't that, so they're like,
748.447	OK, let's look at television.
751.411	"So they looked at an episode of ""Lost."""
753.364	Now, I don't have a TV,
754.577	which makes me a freak,
754.577	but very productive --
756.803	(Laughter)
758.954	"And there's an episode of ""Lost"""
758.954	where one guy has a lucky number,
762.871	but it's not a lucky number,
762.871	it's why he's on the island,
765.593	but they looked
765.593	and the numbers did not match.
767.858	"They looked at ""The Young"
767.858	"and The Restless."" It wasn't that, either."
771.08	It wasn't until the first guy shows up
771.08	the next day and they ask him,
774.389	"""Where did you get your number?"""
775.942	"He said, ""I got it from a fortune cookie."""
777.971	This is a slip one of the winners had,
779.815	because the Tennessee
779.815	lottery security officials
782.175	"were like, ""Oh, no, this can't be true."""
784.12	But it was true.
785.307	Basically, of those 110 people,
	their number from a fortune cookie.
791.469	(Laughter)
793.296	Yeah. So I went and started looking.
796.162	I went across the country,
796.162	looking for these restaurants
798.806	where these people had gotten
798.806	their fortune cookies from.
802.244	There are a bunch of them,
802.244	including Lee's China in Omaha --
805.421	which is actually run by Koreans,
805.421	but that's another point,
808.226	"and a bunch of them named ""China Buffet."""
810.807	What's interesting is that their stories
810.807	were similar, but different.
814.16	It was lunch, it was take-out,
814.16	it was sit-down, it was buffet,
817.16	it was three weeks ago,
817.16	it was three months ago.
819.441	But at some point, all these people
819.441	had a very similar experience
822.585	that converged at a fortune cookie
822.585	and a Chinese restaurant.
825.473	And all these restaurants
825.473	were serving fortune cookies,
828.093	which, of course,
828.093	aren't even Chinese to begin with.
830.563	It's part of the phenomenon
830.563	"I called ""spontaneous self-organization,"""
834.127	where, like in ant colonies,
834.127	little decisions made on the micro level
839.999	actually have a big impact
839.999	on the macro level.
842.309	A good contrast is Chicken McNuggets.
846.726	McDonald's actually spent 10 years
846.726	coming out with a chicken-like product.
850.287	They did chicken pot pie, fried chicken,
850.287	and finally introduced Chicken McNuggets.
854.597	And the great innovation of Chicken
854.597	McNuggets was not nuggifying them,
858.626	that's kind of an easy concept.
860.148	The trick was, they were able
860.148	to remove the chicken from the bone
863.947	in a cost-efficient manner,
865.259	which is why it took so long
865.259	for people to copy them -- 10 years,
868.342	then within a couple months,
868.342	it was such a hit,
870.562	they introduced it across the entire
870.562	McDonald's system in the country.
873.877	In contrast is General Tso's Chicken,
875.667	which actually started
875.667	in New York City in the early 1970s,
878.454	as I was also started in this universe
878.454	in New York City in the early 1970s.
882.013	(Laughter)
883.039	And this logo!
884.214	So me, General Tso's Chicken
884.214	and this logo are all karmicly related.
887.489	But that dish also took about 10 years
887.489	to spread across America
890.481	from a restaurant in New York City.
892.184	"Someone's like, ""It's sweet,"
892.184	it's fried, it's chicken --
894.982	"Americans will love this."""
896.379	So what I like to say,
896.379	this being Bay Area, Silicon Valley,
900.359	is that we think of McDonald's as sort
900.359	of the Microsoft of dining experiences.
904.526	We can think of Chinese
904.526	restaurants perhaps as Linux,
907.306	sort of an open-source thing, right?
909.576	(Laughter)
910.602	Where ideas from one person
910.602	can be copied and propagated
914.271	across the entire system,
915.516	that there can be specialized
915.516	versions of Chinese food,
919.387	depending on the region.
920.562	For example, in New Orleans
920.562	we have Cajun Chinese food,
924.184	where they serve Sichuan alligator
924.184	and sweet and sour crawfish.
927.978	And in Philadelphia,
927.978	you have Philadelphia cheesesteak roll,
931.263	which is like an egg roll on the outside
931.263	and cheesesteak on the inside.
934.626	I was surprised to discover that not only
934.626	in Philadelphia, but also in Atlanta.
938.376	What had happened was,
939.551	a Chinese family had moved
939.551	from Philadelphia to Atlanta,
944.138	and brought that with them.
945.789	So the thing is,
947.51	our historical lore,
947.51	because of the way we like narratives,
950.322	is full of vast characters,
950.322	such as Howard Schultz of Starbucks
953.375	and Ray Kroc with McDonald's
955.655	and Asa Candler with Coca-Cola.
958.16	But, you know, it's very easy
958.16	to overlook the smaller characters.
962.681	For example, Lem Sen,
962.681	who introduced chop suey,
965.015	Chef Peng, who introduced
965.015	General Tso's Chicken,
967.416	and all the Japanese bakers
967.416	who introduced fortune cookies.
971.59	So, the point of my presentation
971.59	is to make you think twice;
974.961	that those whose names
974.961	are forgotten in history
977.423	can often have had as much, if not more,
979.534	impact on what we eat today.
981.453	Thank you very much.
982.628	(Applause)
