12.397	I'm here today to talk about social change,
15.957	not a new therapy or a new intervention
19.24	or a new way of working with kids
19.24	or something like that,
21.957	but a new business model for social change,
24.902	a new way of tackling the problem.
27.809	In Britain, 63 percent of all men
31.983	who come out of short sentences from prison
35.046	re-offend again within a year.
37.567	Now how many previous offenses
40.185	do you think they have on average
42.568	managed to commit?
45.153	Forty-three.
47.301	And how many previous times
47.301	do you think they've been in prison?
50.964	Seven.
52.151	So we went to talk to the Ministry of Justice,
54.965	and we said to the Ministry of Justice,
56.853	what's it worth to you
59.205	if fewer of these guys re-offend?
61.382	It's got to be worth something, right?
63.551	I mean, there's prison costs,
65.378	there's police costs, there's court costs,
68.906	all these things that you're spending money on
71.638	to deal with these guys. What's it worth?
74.151	Now, of course, we care about the social value.
77.146	Social Finance, the organization I helped set up,
80.432	cares about social stuff.
82.675	But we wanted to make the economic case,
85.717	because if we could make the economic case,
87.495	then the value of doing this 
87.495	would be completely compelling.
90.516	And if we can agree on both a value
93.351	and a way of measuring whether we've been
95.688	successful at reducing that re-offending,
98.086	then we can do something
100.057	we think rather interesting.
102.62	The idea is called the social impact bond.
106.544	Now, the social impact bond is simply saying,
108.921	if we can get the government to agree,
110.56	that we can create a contract where
113.311	they only pay if it worked.
116.77	So that means that they can try out new stuff
119.939	without the embarrassment
121.402	of having to pay if it didn't work,
123.41	which for still quite a lot of bits of government,
125.082	that's a serious issue.
126.429	Now, many of you may have noticed
128.024	there's a problem at this point,
129.51	and that is that it takes a long time to measure
131.724	whether those outcomes have happened.
134.49	So we have to raise some money.
137.706	We use the contract to raise money
140.153	from socially motivated investors.
142.377	Socially motivated investors:
144.731	there's an interesting idea, right?
147.029	But actually, there's a lot of people who,
149.42	if they're given the chance,
150.653	would love to invest in something
152.535	that does social good.
155.298	And here's the opportunity.
157.271	Do you want to also help government find
159.528	whether there's a better economic model,
161.964	not just leaving these guys to come out of prison
164.34	and waiting till they re-offend
164.34	and putting them back in again,
167.211	but actually working with them
168.768	to move to a different path
170.327	to end up with fewer crimes
172.926	and fewer victims?
174.941	So we find some investors,
177.452	and they pay for a set of services,
179.822	and if those services are successful,
182.087	then they improve outcomes,
184.58	and with those measured reductions in re-offending,
187.221	government saves money,
188.296	and with those savings,
189.833	they can pay outcomes.
192.287	And the investors do not just get their money back,
194.463	but they make a return.
196.471	So in March 2010, we signed
198.912	the first social impact bond
200.932	with the Ministry of Justice
202.759	around Peterborough Prison.
204.796	It was to work with 3,000 offenders
207.82	split into three cohorts of 1,000 each.
210.748	Now, each of those cohorts
212.737	would get measured over the two years
214.568	that they were coming out of prison.
215.77	They've got to have a year to commit their crimes,
217.825	six months to get through the court system,
220.37	and then they would be compared to a group
222.765	taken from the police national computer,
224.833	as similar as possible,
226.66	and we would get paid
228.194	providing we achieved a hurdle rate
228.194	of 10-percent reduction,
230.983	for every conviction event that didn't happen.
234.541	So we get paid for crimes saved.
238.018	Now if we achieved that 10-percent reduction
242.122	across all three cohorts,
243.807	then the investors get a seven and a half percent
246.947	annualized return on their investment,
249.09	and if we do better than that,
250.63	they can get up to 13 percent
252.226	annualized return on their investment,
254.759	which is okay.
256.877	So everyone wins here, right?
260.085	The Ministry of Justice can try out a new program
262.8	and they only pay if it works.
265.243	Investors get two opportunities:
267.655	for the first time, they can invest in social change.
270.711	Also, they make a reasonable return,
272.742	and they also know that
274.915	first investors in these kinds of things,
277.187	they're going to have to believers.
278.844	They're going to have to care in the social program,
280.947	but if this builds a track record
282.939	over five or 10 years,
284.387	then you can widen that investor community
286.451	as more people have confidence in the product.
288.907	The service providers, well, for the first time,
291.095	they've got an opportunity to provide services
293.954	and grow the evidence for what they're doing
296.181	in a really constructive way and learn
298.741	and demonstrate the value of what they're doing
300.563	over five or six years, not just one or two
302.582	as often happens at the moment.
304.423	Society wins: fewer crimes, fewer victims.
307.901	Now, the offenders, they also benefit.
310.727	Instead of just coming out of the prison
312.157	with 46 pounds in their pocket,
314.081	half of them not knowing where they're spending
315.58	their first night out of jail,
317.718	actually, someone meets them in prison,
320.637	learns about their issues,
322.501	meets them at the gate,
324.42	takes them through to somewhere to stay,
327.173	connects them to benefits,
327.173	connects them to employment,
329.591	drug rehabilitation, mental health,
331.659	whatever's needed.
333.389	So let's think of another example:
336.068	working with children in care.
337.958	Social impact bonds work great
339.582	for any area where there is at the moment
342.243	very expensive provision that produces
344.642	poor outcomes for people.
346.216	So children in the state care
348.13	tend to do very badly.
350.565	Only 13 percent achieve a reasonable level
354.49	of five GCSEs at 16,
357.389	against 58 percent of the wider population.
359.859	More troublingly, 27 percent of offenders in prison
363.518	have spent some time in care.
365.559	And even more worryingly,
366.851	and this is a Home Office statistic,
370.723	have spent some time in care.
372.907	The state is not a great parent.
375.907	But there are great programs
378.732	for adolescents who are on the edge of care,
381.744	and 30 percent of kids going into care
383.62	are adolescents.
385.279	So we set up a program with Essex County Council
388.119	to test out intensive family therapeutic support
391.765	for those families with adolescents
394.805	on the edge of the care system.
396.376	Essex only pays in the event
399.162	that it's saving them care costs.
401.944	Investors have put in 3.1 million pounds.
404.708	That program started last month.
406.966	Others, around homelessness in London,
409.29	around youth and employment and education
413.17	elsewhere in the country.
414.537	There are now 13 social impact bonds in Britain,
417.892	and amazing levels of interest in this idea
420.367	all over the world.
421.89	So David Cameron's put 20 million pounds
424.605	into a social outcomes fund to support this idea.
427.855	Obama has suggested 300 million dollars
431.035	in the U.S. budget for these kinds of ideas
434.568	and structures to move it forward,
436.254	and a lot of other countries
437.745	are demonstrating considerable interest.
439.962	So what's caused this excitement?
442.018	Why is this so different for people?
444.537	Well, the first piece, which we've talked about,
447.029	is innovation.
448.247	It enables testing of new ideas
451.445	in a way that's less difficult for everybody.
455.038	The second piece it brings is rigor.
457.674	By working to outcomes, people really have to test
460.967	and bring data into the situation
460.967	that one's dealing with.
464.845	So taking Peterborough as an example,
467.338	we add case management
469.561	across all of the different organizations
469.561	that we're working with
472.217	so they know
473.502	what actually has been done with different prisoners,
475.651	and at the same time they learn
477.72	from the Ministry of Justice, and we learn,
480.146	because we pushed for the data,
481.881	what actually happens, whether
481.881	they get re-arrested or not.
484.088	And we learn and adapt the program accordingly.
487.376	And this leads to the third element, which is new,
490.313	and that's flexibility.
492.415	Because normal contracting for things,
495.528	when you're spending government money,
497.589	you're spending our money, tax money,
500.1	and the people who are in charge 
500.1	of that are very aware of it
502.797	so the temptation is to control
502.797	exactly how you spend it.
506.647	Now any entrepreneur in the room knows
509.7	that version 1.0, the business plan,
511.797	is not the one that generally works.
514.644	So when you're trying to do something like this,
516.947	you need the flexibility to adapt the program.
519.64	And again, in Peterborough, we started off
522.352	with a program, but we also collected data,
526.509	and over the period of time,
528.386	we nuanced and changed that program
530.584	to add a range of other elements,
533.204	so that the service adapts
534.969	and we meet the needs of the long term
537.47	as well as the short term:
539.534	greater engagement from the prisoners,
542.643	longer-term engagement as well.
545.422	The last element is partnership.
547.958	There is, at the moment, a stale 
547.958	debate going on very often:
551.135	state's better, public sector's better,
553.26	private sector's better, social sector's better,
556.771	for a lot of these programs.
558.439	Actually, for creating social change,
560.421	we need to bring in the expertise
562.16	from all of those parties
563.856	in order to make this work.
565.444	And this creates a structure
567.487	through which they can combine.
569.462	So where does this leave us?
571.394	This leaves us with a way
573.228	that people can invest in social change.
576.215	We've met thousands, possibly millions of people,
579.202	who want the opportunity to invest in social change.
581.635	We've met champions all over the public sector
584.724	keen to make these kinds of differences.
587.139	With this kind of model,
588.924	we can help bring them together.
590.86	Thank you.
592.822	(Applause)
