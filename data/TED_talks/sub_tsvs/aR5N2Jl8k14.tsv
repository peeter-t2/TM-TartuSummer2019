12.555	How many of you are creatives,
14.868	designers, engineers,
14.868	entrepreneurs, artists,
18.516	or maybe you just have
18.516	a really big imagination?
20.927	Show of hands? (Cheers)
22.799	That's most of you.
25.154	I have some news for us creatives.
28.534	Over the course of the next 20 years,
33.291	more will change around
33.291	the way we do our work
37.202	than has happened in the last 2,000.
40.331	In fact, I think we're at the dawn
40.331	of a new age in human history.
45.465	Now, there have been four major historical
45.465	eras defined by the way we work.
51.224	The Hunter-Gatherer Age
51.224	lasted several million years.
54.983	And then the Agricultural Age
54.983	lasted several thousand years.
59.015	The Industrial Age lasted
59.015	a couple of centuries.
62.529	And now the Information Age
62.529	has lasted just a few decades.
66.84	And now today, we're on the cusp
66.84	of our next great era as a species.
73.116	Welcome to the Augmented Age.
75.82	In this new era, your natural human
75.82	capabilities are going to be augmented
79.537	by computational systems
79.537	that help you think,
82.629	robotic systems that help you make,
84.839	and a digital nervous system
86.511	that connects you to the world
86.511	far beyond your natural senses.
91.257	Let's start with cognitive augmentation.
93.223	How many of you are augmented cyborgs?
95.953	(Laughter)
98.627	I would actually argue
98.627	that we're already augmented.
102.108	Imagine you're at a party,
103.636	and somebody asks you a question
103.636	that you don't know the answer to.
107.18	If you have one of these,
107.18	in a few seconds, you can know the answer.
111.689	But this is just a primitive beginning.
114.683	Even Siri is just a passive tool.
118.48	In fact, for the last
118.48	three-and-a-half million years,
121.885	the tools that we've had
121.885	have been completely passive.
126.023	They do exactly what we tell them
126.023	and nothing more.
129.702	Our very first tool only cut
129.702	where we struck it.
133.642	The chisel only carves
133.642	where the artist points it.
137.163	And even our most advanced tools
137.163	do nothing without our explicit direction.
142.828	In fact, to date, and this
142.828	is something that frustrates me,
146.033	we've always been limited
147.505	by this need to manually
147.505	push our wills into our tools --
151.03	like, manual,
151.03	literally using our hands,
153.351	even with computers.
155.892	"But I'm more like Scotty in ""Star Trek."""
158.379	(Laughter)
160.253	I want to have a conversation
160.253	with a computer.
162.423	"I want to say, ""Computer,"
162.423	"let's design a car,"""
165.417	and the computer shows me a car.
166.98	"And I say, ""No, more fast-looking,"
166.98	"and less German,"""
169.612	and bang, the computer shows me an option.
171.799	(Laughter)
174.028	That conversation might be
174.028	a little ways off,
176.358	probably less than many of us think,
179.047	but right now,
180.834	we're working on it.
182.009	Tools are making this leap
182.009	from being passive to being generative.
186.651	Generative design tools
186.651	use a computer and algorithms
189.983	to synthesize geometry
192.615	to come up with new designs
192.615	all by themselves.
195.816	All it needs are your goals
195.816	and your constraints.
198.588	I'll give you an example.
200.02	In the case of this aerial drone chassis,
202.832	all you would need to do
202.832	is tell it something like,
205.482	it has four propellers,
206.779	you want it to be
206.779	as lightweight as possible,
208.934	and you need it to be
208.934	aerodynamically efficient.
211.228	Then what the computer does
211.228	is it explores the entire solution space:
216.166	every single possibility that solves
216.166	and meets your criteria --
220.117	millions of them.
221.583	It takes big computers to do this.
223.582	But it comes back to us with designs
225.561	that we, by ourselves,
225.561	never could've imagined.
229.146	And the computer's coming up
229.146	with this stuff all by itself --
232.082	no one ever drew anything,
233.784	and it started completely from scratch.
236.858	And by the way, it's no accident
239.269	that the drone body looks just like
239.269	the pelvis of a flying squirrel.
243.107	(Laughter)
245.86	It's because the algorithms
245.86	are designed to work
248.186	the same way evolution does.
250.535	What's exciting is we're starting
250.535	to see this technology
253.219	out in the real world.
254.402	We've been working with Airbus
254.402	for a couple of years
256.878	on this concept plane for the future.
258.811	It's a ways out still.
260.905	But just recently we used
260.905	a generative-design AI
264.709	to come up with this.
267.429	This is a 3D-printed cabin partition
267.429	that's been designed by a computer.
272.606	It's stronger than the original
272.606	yet half the weight,
275.454	and it will be flying
275.454	in the Airbus A320 later this year.
279.225	So computers can now generate;
280.808	they can come up with their own solutions
280.808	to our well-defined problems.
286.497	But they're not intuitive.
287.831	They still have to start from scratch
287.831	every single time,
290.941	and that's because they never learn.
294.188	Unlike Maggie.
295.978	(Laughter)
297.583	Maggie's actually smarter
297.583	than our most advanced design tools.
301.287	What do I mean by that?
302.751	If her owner picks up that leash,
304.365	Maggie knows with a fair
304.365	degree of certainty
306.457	it's time to go for a walk.
307.885	And how did she learn?
309.094	Well, every time the owner picked up
309.094	the leash, they went for a walk.
312.442	And Maggie did three things:
314.344	she had to pay attention,
316.237	she had to remember what happened
318.343	and she had to retain and create
318.343	a pattern in her mind.
323.249	Interestingly, that's exactly what
325.368	computer scientists
325.368	have been trying to get AIs to do
327.915	for the last 60 or so years.
330.503	Back in 1952,
331.876	they built this computer
331.876	that could play Tic-Tac-Toe.
336.901	Big deal.
338.849	Then 45 years later, in 1997,
341.873	Deep Blue beats Kasparov at chess.
	humans at Jeopardy,
350.858	which is much harder for a computer
350.858	to play than chess is.
353.81	In fact, rather than working
353.81	from predefined recipes,
357.646	Watson had to use reasoning
357.646	to overcome his human opponents.
362.213	And then a couple of weeks ago,
364.676	DeepMind's AlphaGo beats
364.676	the world's best human at Go,
368.962	which is the most difficult
368.962	game that we have.
371.198	In fact, in Go, there are more
371.198	possible moves
374.118	than there are atoms in the universe.
378.03	So in order to win,
379.88	what AlphaGo had to do
379.88	was develop intuition.
382.918	And in fact, at some points,
382.918	AlphaGo's programmers didn't understand
387.052	why AlphaGo was doing what it was doing.
391.271	And things are moving really fast.
392.955	I mean, consider --
392.955	in the space of a human lifetime,
396.206	computers have gone from a child's game
399.74	to what's recognized as the pinnacle
399.74	of strategic thought.
403.819	What's basically happening
406.26	is computers are going
406.26	from being like Spock
409.594	to being a lot more like Kirk.
411.567	(Laughter)
415.209	Right? From pure logic to intuition.
420.004	Would you cross this bridge?
422.429	"Most of you are saying, ""Oh, hell no!"""
424.776	(Laughter)
426.108	And you arrived at that decision
426.108	in a split second.
428.789	You just sort of knew
428.789	that bridge was unsafe.
431.241	And that's exactly the kind of intuition
433.254	that our deep-learning systems
433.254	are starting to develop right now.
437.542	Very soon, you'll literally be able
439.273	to show something you've made,
439.273	you've designed,
441.503	to a computer,
442.68	and it will look at it and say,
444.193	"""Sorry, homie, that'll never work."
444.193	"You have to try again."""
447.674	Or you could ask it if people
447.674	are going to like your next song,
451.593	or your next flavor of ice cream.
455.369	Or, much more importantly,
457.972	you could work with a computer
457.972	to solve a problem
460.36	that we've never faced before.
462.021	For instance, climate change.
463.446	We're not doing a very
463.446	good job on our own,
465.49	we could certainly use
465.49	all the help we can get.
467.759	That's what I'm talking about,
469.241	technology amplifying
469.241	our cognitive abilities
471.82	so we can imagine and design things
471.82	that were simply out of our reach
475.396	as plain old un-augmented humans.
479.804	So what about making
479.804	all of this crazy new stuff
482.769	that we're going to invent and design?
485.772	I think the era of human augmentation
485.772	is as much about the physical world
489.889	as it is about the virtual,
489.889	intellectual realm.
493.653	How will technology augment us?
496.081	In the physical world, robotic systems.
499.44	OK, there's certainly a fear
501.2	that robots are going to take
501.2	jobs away from humans,
503.712	and that is true in certain sectors.
505.994	But I'm much more interested in this idea
508.896	that humans and robots working together
508.896	are going to augment each other,
513.93	and start to inhabit a new space.
516.012	This is our applied research lab
516.012	in San Francisco,
518.398	where one of our areas of focus
518.398	is advanced robotics,
521.564	specifically, human-robot collaboration.
524.854	And this is Bishop, one of our robots.
527.637	As an experiment, we set it up
529.45	to help a person working in construction
529.45	doing repetitive tasks --
533.804	tasks like cutting out holes for outlets
533.804	or light switches in drywall.
538.022	(Laughter)
541.697	So, Bishop's human partner
541.697	can tell what to do in plain English
544.832	and with simple gestures,
546.161	kind of like talking to a dog,
547.632	and then Bishop executes
547.632	on those instructions
549.799	with perfect precision.
551.715	We're using the human
551.715	for what the human is good at:
554.728	awareness, perception and decision making.
557.085	And we're using the robot
557.085	for what it's good at:
559.349	precision and repetitiveness.
562.072	Here's another cool project
562.072	that Bishop worked on.
564.463	The goal of this project,
564.463	which we called the HIVE,
567.562	was to prototype the experience
567.562	of humans, computers and robots
571.437	all working together to solve
571.437	a highly complex design problem.
575.613	The humans acted as labor.
577.088	They cruised around the construction site,
577.088	they manipulated the bamboo --
580.585	which, by the way,
580.585	because it's a non-isomorphic material,
583.365	is super hard for robots to deal with.
585.263	But then the robots
585.263	did this fiber winding,
587.309	which was almost impossible
587.309	for a human to do.
589.784	And then we had an AI
589.784	that was controlling everything.
593.429	It was telling the humans what to do,
593.429	telling the robots what to do
596.743	and keeping track of thousands
596.743	of individual components.
599.682	What's interesting is,
600.886	building this pavilion
600.886	was simply not possible
604.051	without human, robot and AI
604.051	augmenting each other.
609.71	OK, I'll share one more project.
609.71	This one's a little bit crazy.
613.054	We're working with Amsterdam-based artist
613.054	Joris Laarman and his team at MX3D
617.546	to generatively design
617.546	and robotically print
620.448	the world's first autonomously
620.448	manufactured bridge.
624.135	So, Joris and an AI are designing
624.135	this thing right now, as we speak,
627.844	in Amsterdam.
629.04	And when they're done,
629.04	"we're going to hit ""Go,"""
631.385	and robots will start 3D printing
631.385	in stainless steel,
634.72	and then they're going to keep printing,
634.72	without human intervention,
638.027	until the bridge is finished.
640.919	So, as computers are going
640.919	to augment our ability
643.871	to imagine and design new stuff,
646.045	robotic systems are going to help us
646.045	build and make things
648.964	that we've never been able to make before.
652.167	But what about our ability
652.167	to sense and control these things?
656.351	What about a nervous system
656.351	for the things that we make?
660.406	Our nervous system,
660.406	the human nervous system,
662.942	tells us everything
662.942	that's going on around us.
666.006	But the nervous system of the things
666.006	we make is rudimentary at best.
669.714	For instance, a car doesn't tell
669.714	the city's public works department
673.301	that it just hit a pothole at the corner
673.301	of Broadway and Morrison.
676.455	A building doesn't tell its designers
678.511	whether or not the people inside
678.511	like being there,
681.219	and the toy manufacturer doesn't know
684.253	if a toy is actually being played with --
686.284	how and where and whether
686.284	or not it's any fun.
689.44	Look, I'm sure that the designers
689.44	imagined this lifestyle for Barbie
693.278	when they designed her.
694.526	(Laughter)
695.997	But what if it turns out that Barbie's
695.997	actually really lonely?
698.927	(Laughter)
703.086	If the designers had known
704.398	what was really happening
704.398	in the real world
706.529	with their designs -- the road,
706.529	the building, Barbie --
709.136	they could've used that knowledge
709.136	to create an experience
711.854	that was better for the user.
713.278	What's missing is a nervous system
715.093	connecting us to all of the things
715.093	that we design, make and use.
719.735	What if all of you had that kind
719.735	of information flowing to you
723.314	from the things you create
723.314	in the real world?
727.252	With all of the stuff we make,
728.727	we spend a tremendous amount
728.727	of money and energy --
731.186	in fact, last year,
731.186	about two trillion dollars --
733.586	convincing people to buy
733.586	the things we've made.
736.464	But if you had this connection
736.464	to the things that you design and create
739.876	after they're out in the real world,
741.627	after they've been sold
741.627	or launched or whatever,
745.265	we could actually change that,
746.909	and go from making people want our stuff,
749.98	to just making stuff that people
749.98	want in the first place.
753.438	The good news is, we're working
753.438	on digital nervous systems
756.249	that connect us to the things we design.
760.185	We're working on one project
761.836	with a couple of guys down in Los Angeles
761.836	called the Bandito Brothers
765.572	and their team.
767.003	And one of the things these guys do
767.003	is build insane cars
770.46	that do absolutely insane things.
774.725	These guys are crazy --
776.199	(Laughter)
777.259	in the best way.
780.813	And what we're doing with them
782.6	is taking a traditional race-car chassis
785.064	and giving it a nervous system.
786.673	So we instrumented it
786.673	with dozens of sensors,
789.755	put a world-class driver behind the wheel,
792.414	took it out to the desert
792.414	and drove the hell out of it for a week.
795.795	And the car's nervous system
795.795	captured everything
798.31	that was happening to the car.
799.816	We captured four billion data points;
802.461	all of the forces
802.461	that it was subjected to.
804.795	And then we did something crazy.
807.088	We took all of that data,
808.612	and plugged it into a generative-design AI
808.612	"we call ""Dreamcatcher."""
813.09	So what do get when you give
813.09	a design tool a nervous system,
817.078	and you ask it to build you
817.078	the ultimate car chassis?
820.543	You get this.
824.113	This is something that a human
824.113	could never have designed.
828.527	Except a human did design this,
830.439	but it was a human that was augmented
830.439	by a generative-design AI,
834.772	a digital nervous system
836.027	and robots that can actually
836.027	fabricate something like this.
839.5	So if this is the future,
839.5	the Augmented Age,
843.119	and we're going to be augmented
843.119	cognitively, physically and perceptually,
847.404	what will that look like?
849.396	What is this wonderland going to be like?
852.741	I think we're going to see a world
854.474	where we're moving
854.474	from things that are fabricated
857.566	to things that are farmed.
859.979	Where we're moving from things
859.979	that are constructed
863.456	to that which is grown.
865.954	We're going to move from being isolated
868.166	to being connected.
870.454	And we'll move away from extraction
872.889	to embrace aggregation.
875.787	I also think we'll shift
875.787	from craving obedience from our things
879.578	to valuing autonomy.
882.33	Thanks to our augmented capabilities,
884.259	our world is going to change dramatically.
887.396	We're going to have a world
887.396	with more variety, more connectedness,
890.666	more dynamism, more complexity,
892.977	more adaptability and, of course,
895.319	more beauty.
897.051	The shape of things to come
898.639	will be unlike anything
898.639	we've ever seen before.
900.953	Why?
902.136	Because what will be shaping those things
902.136	is this new partnership
905.915	between technology, nature and humanity.
911.099	That, to me, is a future
