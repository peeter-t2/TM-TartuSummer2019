16.054	Hi. So I'd like to talk a little bit about the people
18.47	who make the things we use every day:
20.999	our shoes, our handbags, our computers and cell phones.
24.759	Now, this is a conversation that often calls up a lot of guilt.
29.205	Imagine the teenage farm girl who makes less than
32.796	a dollar an hour stitching your running shoes,
35.652	or the young Chinese man who jumps off a rooftop
38.35	after working overtime assembling your iPad.
42.39	We, the beneficiaries of globalization, seem to exploit
45.998	these victims with every purchase we make,
48.701	and the injustice
50.334	feels embedded in the products themselves.
53.423	After all, what's wrong with a world in which a worker
55.983	on an iPhone assembly line can't even afford to buy one?
59.759	It's taken for granted that Chinese factories are oppressive,
62.409	and that it's our desire for cheap goods
65.14	that makes them so.
67.501	So, this simple narrative equating Western demand
71.316	and Chinese suffering is appealing,
74.128	especially at a time when many of us already feel guilty
76.763	about our impact on the world,
79.341	but it's also inaccurate and disrespectful.
83.124	We must be peculiarly self-obsessed to imagine that we
86.108	have the power to drive tens of millions of people
89.276	on the other side of the world to migrate and suffer
91.988	in such terrible ways.
94.783	In fact, China makes goods for markets all over the world,
97.601	including its own, thanks to a combination of factors:
101.189	its low costs, its large and educated workforce,
104.595	and a flexible manufacturing system
107.061	that responds quickly to market demands.
110.212	By focusing so much on ourselves and our gadgets,
113.261	we have rendered the individuals on the other end
115.724	into invisibility, as tiny and interchangeable
119.084	as the parts of a mobile phone.
122.139	Chinese workers are not forced into factories
124.804	because of our insatiable desire for iPods.
127.283	They choose to leave their homes in order to earn money,
130.355	to learn new skills, and to see the world.
134.308	In the ongoing debate about globalization, what's
136.701	been missing is the voices of the workers themselves.
140.132	Here are a few.
142.437	"Bao Yongxiu: ""My mother tells me to come home"
146.186	and get married, but if I marry now, before I have fully
149.91	developed myself, I can only marry an ordinary worker,
153.995	"so I'm not in a rush."""
156.498	"Chen Ying: ""When I went home for the new year,"
159.54	everyone said I had changed. They asked me,
162.796	what did you do that you have changed so much?
165.893	I told them that I studied and worked hard. If you tell them
169.171	"more, they won't understand anyway."""
172.539	"Wu Chunming: ""Even if I make a lot of money,"
175.924	it won't satisfy me.
178.075	"Just to make money is not enough meaning in life."""
182.444	"Xiao Jin: ""Now, after I get off work, I study English,"
187.156	because in the future, our customers won't
188.945	"be only Chinese, so we must learn more languages."""
192.807	All of these speakers, by the way, are young women,
198.66	So I spent two years getting to know assembly line workers
201.602	like these in the south China factory city called Dongguan.
205.531	Certain subjects came up over and over:
208.051	how much money they made,
209.955	what kind of husband they hoped to marry,
212.334	whether they should jump to another factory
214.459	or stay where they were.
216.659	Other subjects came up almost never, including
218.852	living conditions that to me looked close to prison life:
227.941	days and nights ruled by the factory clock.
231.275	Everyone they knew lived in similar circumstances,
234.763	and it was still better than the dormitories and homes
237.524	of rural China.
240.092	The workers rarely spoke about the products they made,
242.818	and they often had great difficulty explaining
245.162	what exactly they did.
247.604	When I asked Lu Qingmin,
249.315	the young woman I got to know best,
251.417	what exactly she did on the factory floor,
253.884	she said something to me in Chinese that sounded like
256.289	"""qiu xi."""
258.066	Only much later did I realize that she had been saying
261.035	"""QC,"" or quality control."
264.259	She couldn't even tell me what she did on the factory floor.
268.122	All she could do was parrot a garbled abbreviation
270.579	in a language she didn't even understand.
274.573	Karl Marx saw this as the tragedy of capitalism,
278.195	the alienation of the worker from the product of his labor.
282.238	Unlike, say, a traditional maker of shoes or cabinets,
285.862	the worker in an industrial factory has no control,
289.109	no pleasure, and no true satisfaction or understanding
292.366	in her own work.
294.557	But like so many theories that Marx arrived at
296.973	sitting in the reading room of the British Museum,
299.792	he got this one wrong.
302.618	Just because a person spends her time
304.917	making a piece of something does not mean
307.685	that she becomes that, a piece of something.
310.237	What she does with the money she earns,
313.34	what she learns in that place, and how it changes her,
316.845	these are the things that matter.
319.606	What a factory makes is never the point, and
321.906	the workers could not care less who buys their products.
325.99	Journalistic coverage of Chinese factories,
328.478	on the other hand, plays up this relationship
330.59	between the workers and the products they make.
333.419	Many articles calculate: How long would it take
336.508	for this worker to work in order to earn enough money
339.352	to buy what he's making?
341.812	For example, an entry-level-line assembly line worker
344.3	in China in an iPhone plant would have to shell out
347.572	two and a half months' wages for an iPhone.
351.117	But how meaningful is this calculation, really?
354.454	For example, I recently wrote an article
356.444	in The New Yorker magazine,
357.422	but I can't afford to buy an ad in it.
360.661	But, who cares? I don't want an ad in The New Yorker,
362.717	and most of these workers don't really want iPhones.
365.582	Their calculations are different.
368.342	How long should I stay in this factory?
370.156	How much money can I save?
372.619	How much will it take to buy an apartment or a car,
375.189	to get married, or to put my child through school?
379.779	The workers I got to know had a curiously abstract
382.47	relationship with the product of their labor.
386.228	About a year after I met Lu Qingmin, or Min,
389.37	she invited me home to her family village
391.404	for the Chinese New Year.
393.627	On the train home, she gave me a present:
396.013	a Coach brand change purse with brown leather trim.
400.404	I thanked her, assuming it was fake,
402.077	like almost everything else for sale in Dongguan.
405.554	After we got home, Min gave her mother another present:
409.363	a pink Dooney &amp; Bourke handbag,
411.548	and a few nights later, her sister was showing off
413.971	a maroon LeSportsac shoulder bag.
417.475	Slowly it was dawning on me that these handbags
421.275	were made by their factory,
423.292	and every single one of them was authentic.
426.458	Min's sister said to her parents,
428.923	"""In America, this bag sells for 320 dollars."""
432.285	Her parents, who are both farmers, looked on, speechless.
435.324	"""And that's not all -- Coach is coming out with a new line,"
442.684	"She paused and said, ""I don't know if that's 6,000 yuan or"
446.931	"6,000 American dollars, but anyway, it's 6,000."" (Laughter)"
452.578	Min's sister's boyfriend, who had traveled home with her
455.173	for the new year, said,
457.29	"""It doesn't look like it's worth that much."""
460.123	"Min's sister turned to him and said, ""Some people actually"
462.948	"understand these things. You don't understand shit."""
466.492	(Laughter) (Applause)
471.147	In Min's world, the Coach bags had a curious currency.
475.187	They weren't exactly worthless, but they were nothing
477.507	close to the actual value, because almost no one they knew
480.217	wanted to buy one, or knew how much it was worth.
484.147	Once, when Min's older sister's friend got married,
487.502	she brought a handbag along as a wedding present.
490.33	Another time, after Min had already left
492.498	the handbag factory, her younger sister came to visit,
495.64	bringing two Coach Signature handbags as gifts.
499.751	I looked in the zippered pocket of one,
501.826	and I found a printed card in English, which read,
506.065	"""An American classic."
509.323	In 1941, the burnished patina
511.833	of an all-American baseball glove
514.195	inspired the founder of Coach to create
516.395	a new collection of handbags from the same
518.804	luxuriously soft gloved-hand leather.
522.013	Six skilled leatherworkers crafted 12 Signature handbags
526.188	with perfect proportions and a timeless flair.
530.324	They were fresh, functional, and women everywhere
532.604	"adored them. A new American classic was born."""
537.94	I wonder what Karl Marx would have made of Min
540.266	and her sisters.
542.174	Their relationship with the product of their labor
544.781	was more complicated, surprising and funny
547.076	than he could have imagined.
549.334	And yet, his view of the world persists, and our tendency
552.157	to see the workers as faceless masses,
554.766	to imagine that we can know what they're really thinking.
558.64	The first time I met Min, she had just turned 18
562.041	and quit her first job on the assembly line
564.696	of an electronics factory.
567.011	Over the next two years, I watched as she switched jobs
569.657	five times, eventually landing a lucrative post
572.733	in the purchasing department of a hardware factory.
576.307	Later, she married a fellow migrant worker,
578.832	moved with him to his village,
580.974	gave birth to two daughters,
583.177	and saved enough money to buy a secondhand Buick
585.365	for herself and an apartment for her parents.
589.771	She recently returned to Dongguan on her own
592.904	to take a job in a factory that makes construction cranes,
596.52	temporarily leaving her husband and children
598.72	back in the village.
600.703	In a recent email to me, she explained,
603.284	"""A person should have some ambition while she is young"
607.33	so that in old age she can look back on her life
609.992	"and feel that it was not lived to no purpose."""
614.775	Across China, there are 150 million workers like her,
619.171	one third of them women, who have left their villages
621.924	to work in the factories, the hotels, the restaurants
625.467	and the construction sites of the big cities.
628.072	Together, they make up the largest migration in history,
631.816	and it is globalization, this chain that begins
634.816	in a Chinese farming village
637.335	and ends with iPhones in our pockets and Nikes on our feet
641.112	and Coach handbags on our arms
643.536	that has changed the way these millions of people
645.825	work and marry and live and think.
650.738	Very few of them would want to go back
652.687	to the way things used to be.
655.244	When I first went to Dongguan, I worried that
658.424	it would be depressing to spend so much time with workers.
662.799	I also worried that nothing would ever happen to them,
665.57	or that they would have nothing to say to me.
668.199	Instead, I found young women who were smart and funny
670.849	and brave and generous.
673.696	By opening up their lives to me,
676.027	they taught me so much about factories
678.233	and about China and about how to live in the world.
684.746	This is the Coach purse that Min gave me
687.458	on the train home to visit her family.
689.868	I keep it with me to remind me of the ties that tie me
692.511	to the young women I wrote about,
695.235	ties that are not economic but personal in nature,
699.505	measured not in money but in memories.
703.072	This purse is also a reminder that the things that you imagine,
706.491	sitting in your office or in the library,
710.033	are not how you find them when you actually go out
712.436	into the world.
713.943	Thank you. (Applause)
715.931	(Applause)
722.603	Chris Anderson: Thank you, Leslie, that was an insight
724.672	that a lot of us haven't had before.
727.269	But I'm curious. If you had a minute, say,
730.756	with Apple's head of manufacturing,
734.477	what would you say?
736.837	Leslie Chang: One minute?
737.965	CA: One minute. (Laughter)
739.478	LC: You know, what really impressed me about the workers
741.404	is how much they're self-motivated, self-driven,
744.63	resourceful, and the thing that struck me,
747.247	what they want most is education, to learn,
750.212	because most of them come from very poor backgrounds.
751.759	They usually left school when they were in 7th or 8th grade.
754.703	Their parents are often illiterate,
756.942	and then they come to the city, and they, on their own,
759.582	at night, during the weekends, they'll take a computer class,
761.707	they'll take an English class, and learn
763.975	really, really rudimentary things, you know,
766.099	like how to type a document in Word,
767.838	or how to say really simple things in English.
770.502	So, if you really want to help these workers,
772.63	start these small, very focused, very pragmatic classes
775.853	in these schools, and what's going to happen is,
778.982	all your workers are going to move on,
780.401	but hopefully they'll move on into higher jobs within Apple,
783.808	and you can help their social mobility
786.749	and their self-improvement.
787.746	When you talk to workers, that's what they want.
789.524	"They do not say, ""I want better hot water in the showers."
792.198	"I want a nicer room. I want a TV set."""
794.183	I mean, it would be nice to have those things,
795.806	but that's not why they're in the city,
796.964	and that's not what they care about.
799.053	CA: Was there a sense from them of a narrative that
802.603	things were kind of tough and bad, or was there a narrative
806.015	of some kind of level of growth, that things over time
809.028	were getting better?
810.651	LC: Oh definitely, definitely. I mean, you know,
812.558	it was interesting, because I spent basically two years
814.924	hanging out in this city, Dongguan,
816.918	and over that time, you could see immense change
819.029	in every person's life: upward, downward, sideways,
821.824	but generally upward.
823.645	If you spend enough time, it's upward, and I met people
825.432	who had moved to the city 10 years ago, and who are now
827.727	basically urban middle class people,
829.834	so the trajectory is definitely upward.
831.855	It's just hard to see when you're suddenly
833.79	sucked into the city. It looks like everyone's poor and
835.911	desperate, but that's not really how it is.
837.649	Certainly, the factory conditions are really tough,
839.803	and it's nothing you or I would want to do,
842.12	but from their perspective, where they're coming from
845.265	is much worse, and where they're going
847.262	is hopefully much better, and I just wanted to give
849.27	that context of what's going on in their minds,
851.631	not what necessarily is going on in yours.
853.994	CA: Thanks so much for your talk.
855.49	Thank you very much. (Applause)
