13.617	In December of 2010,
17.293	the city of Apatzingán
19.11	in the coastal state of Michoacán, in Mexico,
22.262	awoke to gunfire.
24.632	For two straight days,
26.208	the city became an open battlefield
28.626	between the federal forces
30.41	and a well-organized group,
32.079	presumably from the local criminal organization,
34.862	La Familia Michoacana, or the Michoacán family.
38.234	The citizens didn't only experience incessant gunfire
41.384	but also explosions
43.804	and burning trucks used as barricades across the city,
47.075	so truly like a battlefield.
49.092	After these two days,
50.622	and during a particularly intense encounter,
53.427	it was presumed that the leader of La Familia Michoacana,
55.994	Nazario Moreno, was killed.
58.499	In response to this terrifying violence,
60.51	the mayor of Apatzingán
62.509	decided to call the citizens to a march for peace.
64.809	The idea was to ask for a softer approach
68.156	to criminal activity in the state.
70.574	And so, the day of the scheduled procession,
73.768	thousands of people showed up.
75.622	As the mayor was preparing to deliver
77.316	the speech starting the march,
79.427	his team noticed
80.929	that, while half of the participants
84.087	were appropriately dressed in white,
85.762	and bearing banners asking for peace,
88.602	the other half was actually marching
90.771	in support of the criminal organization
93.862	and its now-presumed-defunct leader.
97.046	Shocked, the mayor decided to step aside
100.115	rather than participate or lead a procession
102.126	that was ostensibly in support of organized crime.
105.511	And so his team stepped aside.
107.753	The two marches joined together,
109.829	and they continued their path
112.834	towards the state capital.
115.444	This story of horrific violence
120.255	followed by a fumbled approach
122.452	by federal and local authorities as they tried
124.647	to engage civil society,
126.07	who has been very well engaged by a criminal organization,
129.426	is a perfect metaphor for what's happening in Mexico today,
132.89	where we see that our current understanding
136.239	of drug violence and what leads to it
138.607	is probably at the very least incomplete.
141.209	If you decided to spend 30 minutes trying
143.212	to figure out what's going on with drug violence in Mexico
145.242	by, say, just researching online,
147.881	the first thing you would find out is that
149.722	while the laws state that all Mexican citizens are equal,
153.689	there are some that are more
154.808	and there are some that are much less equal than others,
158.167	because you will quickly find out
159.418	that in the past six years
161.122	anywhere between 60 and 100,000 people
163.27	have lost their lives in drug-related violence.
166.828	To put these numbers in perspective,
168.575	this is eight times larger than the number of casualties
171.391	in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.
175.912	It's also shockingly close to the number of people
178.416	who have died in the Syrian civil war,
180.942	which is an active civil war.
183.155	This is happening just south of the border.
186.351	Now as you're reading, however,
187.955	you will be maybe surprised that you will quickly
189.638	become numb to the numbers of deaths,
191.674	because you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers
195.36	of faceless, nameless dead people.
198.953	Implicitly or explicitly, there is a narrative
201.677	that all the people who are dying
203.512	were somehow involved in the drug trade,
206.368	and we infer this because they were either tortured
209.964	or executed in a professional manner,
212.125	or, most likely, both.
213.777	And so clearly they were criminals
215.758	because of the way they died.
218.373	And so the narrative is that somehow these people
220.936	got what they were deserved.
222.179	They were part of the bad guys.
224.63	And that creates some form of comfort
227.178	for a lot of people.
228.81	However, while it's easier to think
231.774	of us, the citizens, the police, the army,
235.759	as the good guys, and them, the narcos,
239.331	the carteles, as the bad guys,
242.625	if you think about it,
243.791	the latter are only providing a service to the former.
247.599	Whether we like it or not,
249.714	the U.S. is the largest market
252.375	for illegal substances in the world,
253.993	accounting for more than half of global demand.
257.047	It shares thousands of miles of border with Mexico
260.307	that is its only route of access from the South,
263.425	and so, as the former dictator of Mexico, Porfirio Diaz,
266.48	"used to say, ""Poor Mexico,"
269.209	"so far from God and so close to the United States."""
275.401	The U.N. estimates that there are 55 million users
278.25	of illegal drugs in the United States.
280.717	Using very, very conservative assumptions,
283.143	this yields a yearly drug market on the retail side
286.24	of anywhere between 30 and 150 billion dollars.
289.023	If we assume that the narcos only have access
291.692	to the wholesale part, which we know is false,
294.416	that still leaves you with yearly revenues
296.757	of anywhere between 15 billion and 60 billion dollars.
301.275	To put these numbers in perspective,
303.191	Microsoft has yearly revenues of 60 billion dollars.
307.984	And it so happens that this is a product that,
310.49	because of its nature, a business model
313.465	to address this market requires you
316.219	to guarantee to your producers
318.348	that their product will be reliably placed
320.966	in the markets where it is consumed.
323.083	And the only way to do this, because it's illegal,
326.64	is to have absolute control of the geographic corridors
329.65	that are used to transport drugs.
331.949	Hence the violence.
334.466	If you look at a map of cartel influence and violence,
337.498	you will see that it almost perfectly aligns
339.618	with the most efficient routes of transportation
341.402	from the south to the north.
343.297	The only thing that the cartels are doing
344.453	is that they're trying to protect their business.
347.204	It's not only a multi-billion dollar market,
349.629	but it's also a complex one.
351.724	For example, the coca plant is a fragile plant
354.448	that can only grow in certain latitudes,
356.764	and so it means that a business model
358.5	to address this market requires you to have
360.235	decentralized, international production,
362.756	that by the way needs to have good quality control,
365.3	because people need a good high
367.801	that is not going to kill them
369.386	and that is going to be delivered to them when they need it.
372.248	And so that means they need to secure
374.241	production and quality control in the south,
377.143	and you need to ensure that you have
379.15	efficient and effective distribution channels
381.642	in the markets where these drugs are consumed.
385.081	I urge you, but only a little bit,
386.672	because I don't want to get you in trouble,
388.883	to just ask around and see how difficult it would be
392.169	to get whatever drug you want, wherever you want it,
395.026	whenever you want it, anywhere in the U.S.,
397.971	and some of you may be surprised to know
400.784	that there are many dealers that offer a service
402.798	where if you send them a text message,
404.622	they guarantee delivery of the drug
406.327	in 30 minutes or less.
409.209	Think about this for a second.
411.63	Think about the complexity
413.361	of the distribution network that I just described.
416.761	It's very difficult to reconcile this
419.259	with the image of faceless, ignorant goons
423.381	that are just shooting each other,
425.986	very difficult to reconcile.
427.674	Now, as a business professor, and as any business professor would tell you,
431.003	an effective organization requires
433.678	an integrated strategy that includes
435.587	a good organizational structure, good incentives,
438.46	a solid identity and good brand management.
441.452	This leads me to the second thing that you would learn
443.587	in your 30-minute exploration of drug violence in Mexico.
446.487	Because you would quickly realize,
448.049	and maybe be confused by the fact,
449.712	that there are three organizations
450.949	that are constantly named in the articles.
454.484	You will hear about Los Zetas,
456.558	the Knights Templar, which is the new brand
458.529	for the Familia Michoacana that I spoke about at the beginning,
461.387	and the Sinaloa Federation.
463.761	You will read that Los Zetas is this assortment
466.552	of sociopaths that terrify the cities that they enter
470.907	and they silence the press,
473.033	and this is somewhat true, or mostly true.
476.407	But this is the result of a very careful branding
480.486	and business strategy.
482.287	You see, Los Zetas is not just
484.456	this random assortment of individuals,
486.256	but was actually created by another criminal organization, the Gulf Cartel,
489.911	that used to control the eastern corridor of Mexico.
492.923	When that corridor became contested, they decided
495.337	that they wanted to recruit
497.127	a professional enforcement arm.
499.958	So they recruited Los Zetas:
503.567	an entire unit of elite paratroopers
506.325	from the Mexican Army.
509.342	They were incredibly effective as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel,
513.048	so much so that at some point, they decided
514.936	to just take over the operations,
517.429	which is why I ask you to never keep tigers as pets,
521.223	because they grow up.
523.864	Because the Zetas organization was founded in treason,
527.56	they lost some of the linkages to the production and distribution
530.496	in the most profitable markets like cocaine,
532.703	but what they did have,
533.993	and this is again based on their military origin,
536.453	was a perfectly structured chain of command
539.3	with a very clear hierarchy
541.925	and a very clear promotion path that allowed them
545.989	to supervise and operate across many, many markets
549.811	very effectively,
551.453	which is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do.
555.252	And so because they didn't have access
556.541	to the more profitable drug markets,
558.876	this pushed them and gave them the opportunity
560.549	to diversify into other forms of crime.
564.047	That includes kidnapping, prostitution,
568.102	local drug dealing and human trafficking,
570.283	including of migrants that go from the south to the U.S.
574.239	So what they currently run is truly
578.487	and quite literally a franchise business.
582.059	They focus most of their recruiting on the army,
585.89	and they very openly advertise for better salaries,
588.967	better benefits, better promotion paths,
591.665	not to mention much better food,
593.313	than what the army can deliver.
596.02	The way they operate is that
597.889	when they arrive in a locality,
599.794	they let people know that they are there,
601.545	and they go to the most powerful local gang
604.615	"and they say, ""I offer you"
606.855	"to be the local representative of the Zeta brand."""
610.044	If they agree -- and you don't want to know
611.917	what happens if they don't --
613.66	they train them and they supervise them
615.347	on how to run the most efficient criminal operation
618.674	for that town, in exchange for royalties.
622.175	This kind of business model obviously depends
624.081	entirely on having a very effective brand of fear,
626.478	and so Los Zetas
628.851	carefully stage acts of violence
631.144	that are spectacular in nature,
633.077	especially when they arrive first in a city,
635.877	but again, that's just a brand strategy.
639.111	I'm not saying they're not violent,
641.01	but what I am saying is that even though you will read
642.953	that they are the most violent of all,
644.816	when you count, when you do the body count,
647.779	they're actually all the same.
651.551	In contrast to them, the Knights Templar
654.639	that arose in Michoacán
656.479	emerged in reaction to the incursion
659.086	of the Zetas into the state of Michoacán.
661.621	Michoacán is a geographically strategic state
664.538	because it has one of the largest ports in Mexico,
666.541	and it has very direct routes to the center of Mexico,
669.132	which then gives you direct access to the U.S.
672.198	The Knights Templar realized very quickly
673.737	that they couldn't face the Zetas on violence alone,
677.245	and so they developed a strategy
679.602	as a social enterprise.
682.381	They brand themselves as representative of
685.381	and protecting of the citizens of Michoacán
688.037	against organized crime.
690.335	Their brand of social enterprise means
692.066	that they require a lot of civic engagement,
694.117	so they invest heavily in providing local services,
698.283	like dealing with home violence,
701.781	going after petty criminals, treating addicts,
705.557	and keeping drugs out of the local markets
708.335	where they are,
710.815	and, of course, protecting people
712.434	from other criminal organizations.
714.925	Now, they kill a lot of people too,
717.956	but when they kill them,
720.068	they provide very careful narratives and descriptions
722.968	for why they did them,
724.22	through newspaper insertions, YouTube videos,
728.183	and billboards that explain that the people who were killed
730.649	were killed because they represented a threat
732.977	not to us, as an organization, of course,
734.833	but to you, as citizens.
736.769	And so we're actually here to protect you.
739.225	They, as social enterprises do,
741.789	have created a moral and ethical code
743.289	that they advertise around,
745.658	and they have very strict recruiting practices.
748.796	And here you have the types of explanations
750.619	that they provide for some of their actions.
754.56	They have actually retained access
756.456	to the profitable drug trade,
758.756	but the way they do it is, because they control all of Michoacán,
760.966	and they control the Port of Lázaro Cárdenas,
763.109	they leverage that to, for example,
764.911	trade copper from Michoacán that is legally created
768.468	and legally extracted
769.868	with illegal ephedrine from China
771.87	which is a critical precursor for methamphetamines
775.294	that they produce, and then they have partnerships
777.694	with larger organizations like the Sinaloa Federation
780.232	that place their products in the U.S.
782.922	Finally, the Sinaloa Federation.
785.593	When you read about them, you will often read about them
787.791	with an undertone of reverence and admiration,
791.491	because they are the most integrated
793.407	and the largest of all the Mexican organizations,
795.695	and, many people argue, the world.
799.149	They started as just sort of a transport organization
802.133	that specialized in smuggling between the U.S.
804.207	and the Mexican borders,
806.332	but now they have grown
807.75	into a truly integrated multinational
811.176	that has partnerships in production in the south
813.482	and partnerships in global distribution
816.495	across the planet.
818.989	They have cultivated a brand of professionalism,
822.319	business acumen and innovation.
825.637	They have designed new drug products
827.736	and new drug processes.
829.459	They have designed narco-tunnels
831.677	that go across the border,
833.218	and you can see that these are not
835.033	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" types."
838.981	They have invented narco-submarines and boats
842.677	that are not detected by radar.
845.36	They have invented drones to transport drugs,
847.923	catapults, you name it.
851.209	One of the leaders of the Sinaloa Federation
853.55	actually made it to the Forbes list.
855.988	[#701 Joaquin Guzman Loera]
857.961	Like any multinational would, they have specialized
860.866	and focused only in the most profitable part of the business,
863.155	which is high-margin drugs like cocaine,
865.833	heroine, methamphetamines.
868.118	Like any traditional Latin American multinational would,
870.691	the way they control their operations
872.432	is through family ties.
874.214	When they're entering a new market, they send
876.159	a family member to supervise it,
877.88	or, if they're partnering with a new organization,
880.697	they create a family tie,
882.117	either through marriages or other types of ties.
886.583	Like any other multinational would,
888.746	they protect their brand by outsourcing
891.913	the more questionable parts of the business model,
894.081	like for example, when they have to engage
896.124	in violence against other criminal organizations,
898.889	they recruit gangs and other smaller players
902.334	to do the dirty work for them,
904.133	and they try to separate their operations
905.918	and their violence and be very discrete about this.
909.553	To further strengthen their brand,
912.049	they actually have professional P.R. firms
914.942	that shape how the press talks about them.
917.421	They have professional videographers on staff.
920.972	They have incredibly productive ties
923.085	with the security organizations
924.918	on both sides of the border.
928.33	And so, differences aside,
930.931	what these three organizations share
934.486	is on the one hand, a very clear understanding
938.126	that institutions cannot be imposed from the top,
941.21	but rather they are built from the bottom up
944.15	one interaction at a time.
947.433	They have created extremely coherent structures
949.854	that they use to show the inconsistencies
952.688	in government policies.
956.715	And so what I want you to remember from this talk
959.202	are three things.
960.735	The first one is that drug violence
963.791	is actually the result
965.668	of a huge market demand
968.919	and an institutional setup that forces
972.569	the servicing of this market to necessitate violence
975.695	to guarantee delivery routes.
979.74	The second thing I want you to remember
981.666	is that these are sophisticated,
983.612	coherent organizations
986.535	that are business organizations,
988.493	and analyzing them and treating them as such
990.412	is probably a much more useful approach.
993.801	The third thing I want you to remember
995.937	is that even though we're more comfortable
997.365	"with this idea of ""them,"""
999.888	a set of bad guys separated from us,
1002.629	we are actually accomplices to them,
1005.606	either through our direct consumption
1007.995	or through our acceptance of the inconsistency
1012.067	between our policies of prohibition
1014.335	and our actual behavior of tolerance
1017.283	or even encouragement of consumption.
1021.507	These organizations service, recruit from,
1025.527	and operate within our communities,
1027.855	so necessarily, they are much more integrated
1030.273	within them than we are comfortable acknowledging.
1034.743	And so to me the question is not whether
1037.608	these dynamics will continue the way they have.
1040.889	We see that the nature of this phenomenon
1043.654	guarantees that they will.
1046.122	The question is whether we are willing to continue
1049.002	our support of a failed strategy
1053.608	based on our stubborn, blissful, voluntary ignorance
1059.115	at the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young.
1064.076	Thank you.
1065.807	(Applause)
