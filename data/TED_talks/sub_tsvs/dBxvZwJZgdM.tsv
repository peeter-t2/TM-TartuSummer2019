16.26	When I was 10 years old,
19.26	a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school.
22.26	And as a special treat,
24.26	he took me to the pathology lab
26.26	and took a real human brain
28.26	out of the jar
30.26	and placed it in my hands.
32.26	And there it was,
34.26	the seat of human consciousness,
36.26	the powerhouse of the human body,
38.26	sitting in my hands.
40.26	And that day I knew that when I grew up,
42.26	I was going to become a brain doctor,
44.26	scientist, something or the other.
47.26	Years later, when I finally grew up,
50.26	my dream came true.
52.26	And it was while I was doing my Ph.D.
54.26	on the neurological causes
56.26	of dyslexia in children
58.26	that I encountered a startling fact
60.26	that I'd like to share with you all today.
64.26	It is estimated that one in six children,
66.26	that's one in six children,
69.26	suffer from some developmental disorder.
73.26	This is a disorder that
75.26	retards mental development in the child
77.26	and causes permanent mental impairments.
81.26	Which means that each and every one of you here today
84.26	knows at least one child that is suffering
87.26	from a developmental disorder.
90.26	But here's what really perplexed me.
92.26	Despite the fact that each
94.26	and every one of these disorders
96.26	originates in the brain,
99.26	most of these disorders
101.26	are diagnosed solely on the basis
103.26	of observable behavior.
106.26	But diagnosing a brain disorder
108.26	without actually looking at the brain
111.26	is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem
114.26	based on their physical symptoms,
116.26	without even doing an ECG or a chest X-ray
119.26	to look at the heart.
121.26	It seemed so intuitive to me.
124.26	To diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately,
127.26	it would be necessary to look at the brain directly.
130.26	Looking at behavior alone
132.26	can miss a vital piece of the puzzle
135.26	and provide an incomplete, or even a misleading,
138.26	picture of the child's problems.
141.26	Yet, despite all the advances in medical technology,
144.26	the diagnosis of brain disorders
146.26	in one in six children
148.26	still remained so limited.
152.26	And then I came across a team at Harvard University
155.26	that had taken one such advanced medical technology
158.26	and finally applied it,
160.26	instead of in brain research,
162.26	towards diagnosing brain disorders in children.
166.26	Their groundbreaking technology
168.26	records the EEG, or the electrical activity
171.26	of the brain, in real time,
174.26	allowing us to watch the brain
176.26	as it performs various functions
179.26	and then detect even the slightest abnormality
181.26	in any of these functions:
183.26	vision, attention, language, audition.
186.26	A program called Brain Electrical
188.26	Activity Mapping
190.26	then triangulates the source
192.26	of that abnormality in the brain.
194.26	And another program called
196.26	Statistical Probability Mapping
198.26	then performs mathematical calculations
201.26	to determine whether any of these abnormalities
203.26	are clinically significant,
205.26	allowing us to provide a much more accurate
207.26	neurological diagnosis
209.26	of the child's symptoms.
211.26	And so I became the head of neurophysiology
214.26	for the clinical arm of this team,
216.26	and we're finally able to use this technology
218.26	towards actually helping
220.26	children with brain disorders.
222.26	And I'm happy to say that I'm now in the process
224.26	of setting up this technology here in India.
228.26	I'd like to tell you about one such child,
231.26	whose story was also covered by ABC News.
235.26	Seven-year-old Justin Senigar
237.26	came to our clinic with this diagnosis
239.26	of very severe autism.
241.26	Like many autistic children,
243.26	his mind was locked inside his body.
246.26	There were moments when he would
248.26	actually space out for seconds at a time.
251.26	And the doctors told his parents
253.26	he was never going to be able
255.26	to communicate or interact socially,
257.26	and he would probably never have too much language.
261.26	When we used this groundbreaking EEG technology
264.26	to actually look at Justin's brain,
267.26	the results were startling.
270.26	It turned out that Justin was almost
272.26	certainly not autistic.
274.26	He was suffering from brain seizures
277.26	that were impossible to see with the naked eye,
280.26	but that were actually causing symptoms
282.26	that mimicked those of autism.
285.26	After Justin was given anti-seizure medication,
288.26	the change in him was amazing.
291.26	Within a period of 60 days,
293.26	his vocabulary went from two to three words
296.26	to 300 words.
298.26	And his communication and social interaction
300.26	were improved so dramatically
302.26	that he was enrolled into a regular school
305.26	and even became a karate super champ.
309.26	Research shows that 50 percent of children,
311.26	almost 50 percent of children
313.26	diagnosed with autism
315.26	are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures.
320.26	These are the faces of the children
322.26	that I have tested
324.26	with stories just like Justin.
327.26	All these children
329.26	came to our clinic with a diagnosis
331.26	of autism, attention deficit disorder,
334.26	mental retardation, language problems.
338.26	Instead, our EEG scans revealed
341.26	very specific problems hidden within their brains
344.26	that couldn't possibly have been detected
346.26	by their behavioral assessments.
349.26	So these EEG scans
351.26	enabled us to provide these children
353.26	with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis
356.26	and much more targeted treatment.
360.26	For too long now, children with developmental disorders
363.26	have suffered from misdiagnosis
365.26	while their real problems have gone undetected
367.26	and left to worsen.
369.26	And for too long, these children and their parents
372.26	have suffered undue frustration and desperation.
375.26	But we are now in a new era of neuroscience,
378.26	one in which we can finally look
381.26	directly at brain function in real time
384.26	with no risks and no side effects, non-invasively,
387.26	and find the true source
389.26	of so many disabilities in children.
392.26	So if I could inspire
394.26	even a fraction of you in the audience today
397.26	to share this pioneering diagnostic approach
400.26	with even one parent whose child
402.26	is suffering from a developmental disorder,
405.26	then perhaps one more puzzle
407.26	in one more brain will be solved.
409.26	One more mind will be unlocked.
411.26	And one more child who has been misdiagnosed
413.26	or even undiagnosed by the system
416.26	will finally realize his or her true potential
419.26	while there's still time
421.26	for his or her brain to recover.
423.26	And all this by simply watching the child's brainwaves.
426.26	Thank you.
428.26	(Applause)
