18.33	I grew up to study the brain
20.398	because I have a brother
20.398	who has been diagnosed
22.836	with a brain disorder, schizophrenia.
25.806	And as a sister and later, as a scientist,
29.771	I wanted to understand,
29.771	why is it that I can take my dreams,
34.088	I can connect them to my reality,
36.347	and I can make my dreams come true?
39.037	What is it about my brother's brain
39.037	and his schizophrenia
42.838	that he cannot connect his dreams
42.838	to a common and shared reality,
48.33	so they instead become delusion?
50.703	So I dedicated my career to research
50.703	into the severe mental illnesses.
55.703	And I moved from my home state
55.703	of Indiana to Boston,
59.33	where I was working in the lab
59.33	of Dr. Francine Benes,
61.881	in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry.
65.172	And in the lab,
65.172	we were asking the question,
68.33	"""What are the biological differences"
71.204	between the brains of individuals
71.204	who would be diagnosed as normal control,
75.33	as compared with the brains of individuals
78.024	diagnosed with schizophrenia,
78.024	"schizoaffective or bipolar disorder?"""
82.964	So we were essentially
82.964	mapping the microcircuitry of the brain:
87.479	which cells are communicating
87.479	with which cells,
90.605	with which chemicals,
92.163	and then in what quantities
92.163	of those chemicals?
95.536	So there was a lot of meaning in my life
97.789	because I was performing
97.789	this type of research during the day,
101.321	but then in the evenings
101.321	and on the weekends,
104.447	I traveled as an advocate for NAMI,
104.447	the National Alliance on Mental Illness.
110.034	But on the morning of December 10, 1996,
113.33	I woke up to discover that I had
113.33	a brain disorder of my own.
117.687	A blood vessel exploded
117.687	in the left half of my brain.
122.254	And in the course of four hours,
124.448	I watched my brain completely deteriorate
127.674	in its ability to process all information.
131.282	On the morning of the hemorrhage,
133.061	I could not walk, talk, read,
133.061	write or recall any of my life.
138.33	I essentially became
138.33	an infant in a woman's body.
143.33	If you've ever seen a human brain,
146.33	it's obvious that the two hemispheres
146.33	are completely separate from one another.
150.199	And I have brought for you
150.199	a real human brain.
155.16	(Groaning, laughter)
163.235	So this is a real human brain.
166.648	This is the front of the brain,
168.33	the back of brain
168.33	with the spinal cord hanging down,
171.799	and this is how it would be
171.799	positioned inside of my head.
176.242	And when you look at the brain,
177.81	it's obvious that
177.81	the two cerebral cortices
180.843	are completely separate from one another.
184.029	For those of you who understand computers,
186.33	our right hemisphere functions
186.33	like a parallel processor,
190.279	while our left hemisphere functions
190.279	like a serial processor.
194.552	The two hemispheres
194.552	do communicate with one another
197.401	through the corpus callosum,
198.98	which is made up of some
203.198	But other than that,
204.33	the two hemispheres
204.33	are completely separate.
207.614	Because they process
207.614	information differently,
211.33	each of our hemispheres
211.33	think about different things,
214.33	they care about different things,
214.33	and, dare I say,
217.918	they have very different personalities.
223.33	Excuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy.
227.116	Assistant: It has been.
228.44	(Laughter)
231.532	Our right human hemisphere
231.532	is all about this present moment.
236.385	"It's all about ""right here, right now."""
240.33	Our right hemisphere,
240.33	it thinks in pictures
243.33	and it learns kinesthetically
243.33	through the movement of our bodies.
247.33	Information, in the form of energy,
247.33	streams in simultaneously
252.33	through all of our sensory systems
254.33	and then it explodes
254.33	into this enormous collage
257.33	of what this present moment looks like,
261.33	what this present moment
261.33	smells like and tastes like,
264.33	what it feels like
264.33	and what it sounds like.
269.33	I am an energy-being connected
269.33	to the energy all around me
274.33	through the consciousness
274.33	of my right hemisphere.
278.568	We are energy-beings
278.568	connected to one another
282.21	through the consciousness
282.21	of our right hemispheres
285.005	as one human family.
287.817	And right here, right now, we are brothers
287.817	and sisters on this planet,
291.878	here to make the world a better place.
295.33	And in this moment we are perfect,
295.33	we are whole and we are beautiful.
302.33	My left hemisphere, our left hemisphere,
302.33	is a very different place.
307.33	Our left hemisphere
307.33	thinks linearly and methodically.
312.183	Our left hemisphere is all about the past
312.183	and it's all about the future.
317.33	Our left hemisphere is designed to take
320.33	that enormous collage
320.33	of the present moment
322.946	and start picking out details,
322.946	and more details about those details.
328.02	It then categorizes and organizes
328.02	all that information,
332.437	associates it with everything
332.437	in the past we've ever learned,
335.972	and projects into the future
335.972	all of our possibilities.
340.33	And our left hemisphere
340.33	thinks in language.
344.33	It's that ongoing brain chatter
344.33	that connects me and my internal world
349.282	to my external world.
351.33	It's that little voice that says to me,
354.12	"""Hey, you've got to remember"
354.12	to pick up bananas on your way home.
357.932	"I need them in the morning."""
359.33	It's that calculating intelligence
361.252	that reminds me
361.252	when I have to do my laundry.
365.095	But perhaps most important,
365.095	it's that little voice that says to me,
369.948	"""I am. I am."""
373.803	And as soon as my left hemisphere
373.803	"says to me ""I am,"""
377.822	I become separate.
379.46	I become a single solid individual,
381.739	separate from the energy flow around me
384.058	and separate from you.
385.914	And this was the portion of my brain
385.914	that I lost on the morning of my stroke.
390.747	On the morning of the stroke,
393.826	I woke up to a pounding
393.826	pain behind my left eye.
398.149	And it was the kind of caustic pain
398.149	that you get when you bite into ice cream.
402.984	And it just gripped me --
404.853	and then it released me.
407.088	And then it just gripped me --
409.223	and then it released me.
410.974	And it was very unusual for me
410.974	to ever experience any kind of pain,
415.33	"so I thought, ""OK, I'll just start"
415.33	"my normal routine."""
417.926	So I got up and I jumped
417.926	onto my cardio glider,
420.33	which is a full-body,
420.33	full-exercise machine.
424.545	And I'm jamming away on this thing,
426.779	and I'm realizing that my hands
426.779	look like primitive claws
431.572	grasping onto the bar.
434.064	"And I thought, ""That's very peculiar."""
436.079	And I looked down at my body
437.559	and I thought,
437.559	"""Whoa, I'm a weird-looking thing."""
441.33	And it was as though my consciousness
441.33	had shifted away
444.02	from my normal perception of reality,
446.517	where I'm the person on the machine
446.517	having the experience,
449.518	to some esoteric space
451.44	where I'm witnessing myself
451.44	having this experience.
455.266	And it was all very peculiar,
455.266	and my headache was just getting worse.
458.574	So I get off the machine,
459.897	and I'm walking
459.897	across my living room floor,
462.33	and I realize that everything
462.33	inside of my body has slowed way down.
466.996	And every step is very rigid
466.996	and very deliberate.
470.456	There's no fluidity to my pace,
473.329	and there's this constriction
473.329	in my area of perception,
476.281	so I'm just focused on internal systems.
479.33	And I'm standing in my bathroom
480.885	getting ready to step into the shower,
482.756	and I could actually hear
482.756	the dialogue inside of my body.
485.529	"I heard a little voice saying, ""OK."
485.529	You muscles, you've got to contract.
489.33	"You muscles, you relax."""
490.742	And then I lost my balance,
490.742	and I'm propped up against the wall.
494.9	And I look down at my arm
496.869	and I realize that I can no longer define
496.869	the boundaries of my body.
502.615	I can't define where I begin
502.615	and where I end,
506.138	because the atoms
506.138	and the molecules of my arm
508.33	blended with the atoms
508.33	and molecules of the wall.
512.33	And all I could detect
512.33	was this energy -- energy.
516.33	And I'm asking myself,
516.33	"""What is wrong with me?"
518.497	"What is going on?"""
520.3	And in that moment, my left hemisphere
520.3	brain chatter went totally silent.
526.091	Just like someone took a remote control
526.091	and pushed the mute button.
530.037	Total silence.
531.91	And at first I was shocked to find myself
531.91	inside of a silent mind.
536.687	But then I was immediately captivated
539.95	by the magnificence
539.95	of the energy around me.
543.734	And because I could no longer
543.734	identify the boundaries of my body,
547.632	I felt enormous and expansive.
551.194	I felt at one with
551.194	all the energy that was,
554.543	and it was beautiful there.
556.733	Then all of a sudden
556.733	my left hemisphere comes back online
559.599	and it says to me,
559.599	"""Hey! We've got a problem!"
561.83	"We've got to get some help."""
563.354	"And I'm going, ""Ahh! I've got a problem!"""
565.406	(Laughter)
566.957	"So it's like, ""OK, I've got a problem."""
568.972	But then I immediately drifted
568.972	right back out into the consciousness --
573.495	and I affectionately
573.495	refer to this space as La La Land.
578.123	But it was beautiful there.
579.736	Imagine what it would be like to be
579.736	totally disconnected
582.758	from your brain chatter that connects you
582.758	to the external world.
586.33	So here I am in this space,
588.196	and my job, and any stress
588.196	related to my job -- it was gone.
592.33	And I felt lighter in my body.
596.203	And imagine all of the relationships
596.203	in the external world
599.33	and any stressors related
599.33	to any of those -- they were gone.
602.726	And I felt this sense of peacefulness.
606.631	And imagine
606.631	what it would feel like to lose
612.751	(Laughter) Oh! I felt euphoria --
618.33	euphoria.
620.205	It was beautiful.
621.33	And again, my left hemisphere
621.33	comes online and it says,
623.98	"""Hey! You've got to pay attention."
625.63	"We've got to get help."""
627.052	"And I'm thinking, ""I've got to get help."
627.052	"I've got to focus."""
629.931	So I get out of the shower
629.931	and I mechanically dress
632.423	and I'm walking around my apartment,
634.254	and I'm thinking,
634.254	"""I've got to get to work. Can I drive?"""
638.33	And in that moment,
639.623	my right arm went totally
639.623	paralyzed by my side.
641.989	"Then I realized, ""Oh my gosh!"
641.989	"I'm having a stroke!"""
646.33	And the next thing my brain says to me is,
648.973	Wow! This is so cool!
651.363	(Laughter)
653.331	This is so cool!
654.918	How many brain scientists
654.918	have the opportunity
657.497	to study their own brain
657.497	"from the inside out?"""
660.33	(Laughter)
662.33	And then it crosses my mind,
662.33	"""But I'm a very busy woman!"""
666.33	(Laughter)
667.504	"""I don't have time for a stroke!"""
669.695	"So I'm like, ""OK, I can't stop"
669.695	the stroke from happening,
672.421	so I'll do this for a week or two,
672.421	and then I'll get back to my routine. OK.
676.33	So I've got to call help.
676.33	"I've got to call work."""
678.806	I couldn't remember the number at work,
680.73	so I remembered, in my office
680.73	I had a business card with my number.
684.523	So I go into my business room, I pull
684.523	out a three-inch stack of business cards.
688.856	And I'm looking at the card on top
690.537	and even though I could see clearly
690.537	in my mind's eye
693.895	what my business card looked like,
695.63	I couldn't tell if this
695.63	was my card or not,
698.242	because all I could see were pixels.
700.132	And the pixels of the words
700.132	blended with the pixels of the background
704.236	and the pixels of the symbols,
704.236	and I just couldn't tell.
707.568	And then I would wait
707.568	for what I call a wave of clarity.
710.732	And in that moment, I would be able
710.732	to reattach to normal reality
715.044	and I could tell that's not the card...
715.044	that's not the card.
719.218	It took me 45 minutes to get one inch
719.218	down inside of that stack of cards.
725.25	In the meantime, for 45 minutes,
727.148	the hemorrhage is getting bigger
727.148	in my left hemisphere.
729.83	I do not understand numbers,
729.83	I do not understand the telephone,
732.854	but it's the only plan I have.
734.43	So I take the phone pad
734.43	and I put it right here.
737.139	I take the business card,
737.139	I put it right here,
739.545	and I'm matching the shape
739.545	of the squiggles on the card
743.33	to the shape of the squiggles
743.33	on the phone pad.
746.671	But then I would drift back out
746.671	into La La Land,
749.33	and not remember when I came back
749.33	if I'd already dialed those numbers.
753.33	So I had to wield
753.33	my paralyzed arm like a stump
757.33	and cover the numbers
757.33	as I went along and pushed them,
761.33	so that as I would come back
761.33	to normal reality,
764.044	"I'd be able to tell, ""Yes,"
764.044	"I've already dialed that number."""
768.076	Eventually, the whole number gets dialed
768.076	and I'm listening to the phone,
772.44	and my colleague picks up the phone
772.44	and he says to me,
776.027	"""Woo woo woo woo."" (Laughter)"
777.694	(Laughter)
781.153	And I think to myself,
783.027	"""Oh my gosh, he sounds"
783.027	"like a Golden Retriever!"""
786.09	(Laughter)
787.741	And so I say to him --
787.741	clear in my mind, I say to him:
790.926	"""This is Jill! I need help!"""
792.592	And what comes out of my voice is,
792.592	"""Woo woo woo woo woo."""
796.33	"I'm thinking, ""Oh my gosh,"
796.33	"I sound like a Golden Retriever."""
799.164	So I couldn't know -- I didn't know
801.109	that I couldn't speak or understand
801.109	language until I tried.
804.759	So he recognizes that I need help
804.759	and he gets me help.
808.441	And a little while later,
808.441	I am riding in an ambulance
812.075	from one hospital across Boston
812.075	to [Massachusetts] General Hospital.
816.487	And I curl up into a little fetal ball.
819.661	And just like a balloon
819.661	with the last bit of air,
826.233	just right out of the balloon,
828.407	I just felt my energy lift
828.407	and just I felt my spirit surrender.
834.295	And in that moment, I knew that I was
834.295	no longer the choreographer of my life.
840.33	And either the doctors rescue my body
840.33	and give me a second chance at life,
844.747	or this was perhaps
844.747	my moment of transition.
853.049	When I woke later that afternoon,
855.28	I was shocked to discover
855.28	that I was still alive.
860.375	When I felt my spirit surrender,
860.375	I said goodbye to my life.
865.33	And my mind was now suspended
867.679	between two very opposite
867.679	planes of reality.
871.901	Stimulation coming in
871.901	through my sensory systems
875.212	felt like pure pain.
877.488	Light burned my brain like wildfire,
880.726	and sounds were so loud and chaotic
884.345	that I could not pick a voice out
884.345	from the background noise,
888.551	and I just wanted to escape.
891.148	Because I could not identify the position
891.148	of my body in space,
896.316	I felt enormous and expansive,
900.157	like a genie just liberated
900.157	from her bottle.
904.982	And my spirit soared free,
907.68	like a great whale gliding
907.68	through the sea of silent euphoria.
914.885	Nirvana.
916.593	I found Nirvana.
921.291	And I remember thinking,
922.735	there's no way I would ever be able
922.735	to squeeze the enormousness of myself
927.189	back inside this tiny little body.
932.147	"But then I realized, ""But I'm still alive!"
935.679	I'm still alive, and I have found Nirvana.
938.806	And if I have found Nirvana
938.806	and I'm still alive,
942.536	then everyone who is alive
942.536	"can find Nirvana."""
948.758	And I pictured a world
950.053	filled with beautiful, peaceful,
950.053	compassionate, loving people
956.037	who knew that they could come
956.037	to this space at any time.
960.497	And that they could purposely choose
964.004	to step to the right
964.004	of their left hemispheres --
968.401	and find this peace.
970.33	And then I realized
971.577	what a tremendous gift
971.577	this experience could be,
975.158	what a stroke of insight this could be
975.158	to how we live our lives.
982.434	And it motivated me to recover.
988.259	Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage,
988.259	the surgeons went in,
992.433	and they removed a blood clot
992.433	the size of a golf ball
995.005	that was pushing on my language centers.
997.02	Here I am with my mama,
998.67	who is a true angel in my life.
1002.146	It took me eight years
1002.146	to completely recover.
1006.996	So who are we?
1009.057	We are the life-force power
1009.057	of the universe,
1014.083	with manual dexterity
1014.083	and two cognitive minds.
1018.956	And we have the power
1018.956	to choose, moment by moment,
1022.281	who and how we want to be in the world.
1025.983	Right here, right now,
1027.562	I can step into the consciousness
1027.562	of my right hemisphere, where we are.
1032.812	I am the life-force power of the universe.
1035.893	I am the life-force power
1037.457	of the 50 trillion beautiful
1037.457	molecular geniuses that make up my form,
1042.315	at one with all that is.
1045.33	Or, I can choose to step into
1045.33	the consciousness of my left hemisphere,
1050.698	where I become
1050.698	a single individual, a solid.
1054.003	Separate from the flow, separate from you.
1057.586	I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor:
1059.72	intellectual, neuroanatomist.
1064.439	"These are the ""we"" inside of me."
1069.814	Which would you choose?
1073.853	Which do you choose?
1077.167	And when?
1081.107	I believe that the more time we spend
1083.33	choosing to run the deep
1083.33	inner-peace circuitry
1086.331	of our right hemispheres,
1088.575	the more peace we will project
1088.575	into the world,
1091.905	and the more peaceful our planet will be.
1095.528	And I thought that was an idea
1095.528	worth spreading.
1099.33	Thank you.
1100.43	(Applause)
