15.17	So, stepping down out of the bus,
18.151	I headed back to the corner
19.896	to head west en route to a braille training session.
23.284	It was the winter of 2009,
25.394	and I had been blind for about a year.
27.815	Things were going pretty well.
29.948	Safely reaching the other side,
31.855	I turned to the left,
33.316	pushed the auto-button for
33.316	the audible pedestrian signal,
35.92	and waited my turn.
37.844	As it went off, I took off
39.933	and safely got to the other side.
41.606	Stepping onto the sidewalk,
43.702	I then heard the sound of a steel chair
46.396	slide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me.
50.552	I know there's a cafe on the corner,
52.469	and they have chairs out in front,
54.115	so I just adjusted to the left
55.511	to get closer to the street.
57.355	As I did, so slid the chair.
60.995	I just figured I'd made a mistake,
63.076	and went back to the right,
64.914	and so slid the chair in perfect synchronicity.
68.409	Now I was getting a little anxious.
70.774	I went back to the left,
72.387	and so slid the chair,
73.676	blocking my path of travel.
76.284	Now, I was officially freaking out.
79.286	So I yelled,
80.871	"""Who the hell's out there? What's going on?"""
84.132	Just then, over my shout,
86.384	I heard something else, a familiar rattle.
89.069	It sounded familiar,
90.915	and I quickly considered another possibility,
92.778	and I reached out with my left hand,
94.709	as my fingers brushed against something fuzzy,
98.113	and I came across an ear,
100.664	the ear of a dog, perhaps a golden retriever.
104.926	Its leash had been tied to the chair
106.915	as her master went in for coffee,
108.652	and she was just persistent in her efforts
110.444	to greet me, perhaps get a scratch behind the ear.
113.782	Who knows, maybe she was volunteering for service.
116.394	(Laughter)
118.773	But that little story is really about
121.182	the fears and misconceptions that come along
124.381	with the idea of moving through the city
127.284	without sight,
128.607	seemingly oblivious to the environment
131.568	and the people around you.
134.468	So let me step back and set the stage a little bit.
138.369	On St. Patrick's Day of 2008,
140.928	I reported to the hospital for surgery
143.515	to remove a brain tumor.
145.709	The surgery was successful.
147.796	Two days later, my sight started to fail.
150.965	On the third day, it was gone.
154.487	Immediately, I was struck by an incredible sense
156.584	of fear, of confusion, of vulnerability,
160.473	like anybody would.
162.922	But as I had time to stop and think,
165.414	I actually started to realize
167.165	I had a lot to be grateful for.
170.089	In particular, I thought about my dad,
173.085	who had passed away from complications
175.282	from brain surgery.
177.385	He was 36. I was seven at the time.
182.476	So although I had every reason
185.169	to be fearful of what was ahead,
187.401	and had no clue quite what was going to happen,
190.035	I was alive.
191.793	My son still had his dad.
194.505	And besides, it's not like I was the first person
196.392	ever to lose their sight.
198.005	I knew there had to be all sorts of systems
200.154	and techniques and training to have
202.471	to live a full and meaningful, active life
205.033	without sight.
206.635	So by the time I was discharged from the hospital
208.782	a few days later, I left with a mission,
211.486	a mission to get out and get the best training
213.616	as quickly as I could and get on to rebuilding my life.
218.78	Within six months, I had returned to work.
222.828	My training had started.
224.43	I even started riding a tandem bike
226.09	with my old cycling buddies,
227.715	and was commuting to work on my own,
230.412	walking through town and taking the bus.
232.887	It was a lot of hard work.
235.65	But what I didn't anticipate
237.917	through that rapid transition
240.889	was the incredible experience of the juxtaposition
244.637	of my sighted experience
244.637	up against my unsighted experience
248.577	of the same places and the same people
251.25	within such a short period of time.
254.753	From that came a lot of insights,
256.649	or outsights, as I called them,
258.146	things that I learned since losing my sight.
261.535	These outsights ranged from the trival
264.502	to the profound,
266.167	from the mundane to the humorous.
268.735	As an architect, that stark juxtaposition
271.752	of my sighted and unsighted experience
274.266	of the same places and the same cities
276.551	within such a short period of time
278.564	has given me all sorts of wonderful outsights
280.77	of the city itself.
283.944	Paramount amongst those
285.818	was the realization that, actually,
287.812	cities are fantastic places for the blind.
291.752	And then I was also surprised
294.073	by the city's propensity for kindness and care
297.441	as opposed to indifference or worse.
300.921	And then I started to realize that
302.684	it seemed like the blind seemed to have
304.673	a positive influence on the city itself.
308.742	That was a little curious to me.
311.996	Let me step back and take a look
314.556	at why the city is so good for the blind.
319.918	Inherent with the training for recovery from sight loss
323.54	is learning to rely on all your non-visual senses,
327.411	things that you would otherwise maybe ignore.
330.637	It's like a whole new world of sensory information
333.182	opens up to you.
334.631	I was really struck by the symphony
336.159	of subtle sounds all around me in the city
339.135	that you can hear and work with
340.427	to understand where you are,
342.309	how you need to move, and where you need to go.
345.114	Similarly, just through the grip of the cane,
347.838	you can feel contrasting textures in the floor below,
351.752	and over time you build a pattern of where you are
354.186	and where you're headed.
355.728	Similarly, just the sun warming one side of your face
358.62	or the wind at your neck
361.449	gives you clues about your alignment
363.649	and your progression through a block
365.342	and your movement through time and space.
368.847	But also, the sense of smell.
371.28	Some districts and cities have their own smell,
373.981	as do places and things around you,
377.022	and if you're lucky, you can even follow your nose
378.814	to that new bakery that you've been looking for.
382.243	All this really surprised me,
383.952	because I started to realize that
386.957	my unsighted experienced
389.51	was so far more multi-sensory
391.945	than my sighted experience ever was.
394.97	What struck me also was how much the city
397.71	was changing around me.
399.342	When you're sighted,
401.079	everybody kind of sticks to themselves,
403.268	you mind your own business.
405.081	Lose your sight, though,
406.348	and it's a whole other story.
409.147	And I don't know who's watching who,
410.626	but I have a suspicion that
410.626	a lot of people are watching me.
414.175	And I'm not paranoid, but everywhere I go,
416.323	I'm getting all sorts of advice:
419.352	Go here, move there, watch out for this.
421.672	A lot of the information is good.
423.749	Some of it's helpful. A lot of it's kind of reversed.
426.235	You've got to figure out what they actually meant.
429.804	Some of it's kind of wrong and not helpful.
433.357	But it's all good in the grand scheme of things.
436.368	But one time I was in Oakland
437.904	walking along Broadway, and came to a corner.
440.791	I was waiting for an audible pedestrian signal,
443.598	and as it went off, I was just about
443.598	to step out into the street,
446.084	when all of a sudden, my right hand
448.116	was just gripped by this guy,
449.796	and he yanked my arm
449.796	and pulled me out into the crosswalk
452.208	and was dragging me out across the street,
453.882	speaking to me in Mandarin.
456.134	(Laughter)
457.542	It's like, there was no escape
457.542	from this man's death grip,
461.681	but he got me safely there.
463.404	What could I do?
465.754	But believe me, there are more polite ways
467.55	to offer assistance.
469.723	We don't know you're there,
471.245	"so it's kind of nice to say ""Hello"" first."
473.225	"""Would you like some help?"""
475.361	But while in Oakland, I've really been struck by
478.412	how much the city of Oakland changed
481.03	as I lost my sight.
483.532	I liked it sighted. It was fine.
485.699	It's a perfectly great city.
488.275	But once I lost my sight
489.544	and was walking along Broadway,
491.859	I was blessed every block of the way.
495.07	"""Bless you, man."""
496.624	"""Go for it, brother."""
498.887	"""God bless you."""
500.637	I didn't get that sighted.
502.497	(Laughter)
503.833	And even without sight,
503.833	I don't get that in San Francisco.
510.158	And I know it bothers some of my blind friends,
513.15	it's not just me.
514.743	Often it's thought that
516.792	that's an emotion that comes up out of pity.
519.936	I tend to think that it comes
519.936	out of our shared humanity,
523.049	out of our togetherness, and I think it's pretty cool.
526.159	In fact, if I'm feeling down,
528.019	I just go to Broadway in downtown Oakland,
529.927	I go for a walk, and I feel better like that,
532.586	in no time at all.
535.857	But also that it illustrates how
537.892	disability and blindness
539.674	sort of cuts across ethnic, social,
542.394	racial, economic lines.
545.12	Disability is an equal-opportunity provider.
548.955	Everybody's welcome.
551.398	In fact, I've heard it said in the disability community
553.959	that there are really only two types of people:
556.461	There are those with disabilities,
558.22	and there are those that haven't
558.22	quite found theirs yet.
562.882	It's a different way of thinking about it,
565.003	but I think it's kind of beautiful,
567.252	because it is certainly far more inclusive
569.428	than the us-versus-them
571.533	or the abled-versus-the-disabled,
574.101	and it's a lot more honest and respectful
576.879	of the fragility of life.
580.183	So my final takeaway for you is
582.108	that not only is the city good for the blind,
586.176	but the city needs us.
589.355	And I'm so sure of that that
591.393	I want to propose to you today
592.989	that the blind be taken as
592.989	the prototypical city dwellers
596.429	when imagining new and wonderful cities,
599.714	and not the people that are thought about
601.575	after the mold has already been cast.
603.808	It's too late then.
606.861	So if you design a city with the blind in mind,
610.045	you'll have a rich, walkable network of sidewalks
614.63	with a dense array of options and choices
616.744	all available at the street level.
620.176	If you design a city with the blind in mind,
622.498	sidewalks will be predictable and will be generous.
625.618	The space between buildings will be well-balanced
627.971	between people and cars.
631.41	In fact, cars, who needs them?
635.467	If you're blind, you don't drive. (Laughter)
638.552	They don't like it when you drive. (Laughter)
641.915	If you design a city with the blind in mind,
644.625	you design a city with a robust,
647.268	accessible, well-connected mass transit system
650.96	that connects all parts of the city
652.562	and the region all around.
655.581	If you design a city with the blind in mind,
657.647	there'll be jobs, lots of jobs.
660.466	Blind people want to work too.
661.796	They want to earn a living.
664.235	So, in designing a city for the blind,
666.991	I hope you start to realize
669.06	that it actually would be a more inclusive,
671.938	a more equitable, a more just city for all.
675.544	And based on my prior sighted experience,
677.764	it sounds like a pretty cool city,
679.742	whether you're blind, whether you have a disability,
683.089	or you haven't quite found yours yet.
685.573	So thank you.
688.185	(Applause)
