15.766	So, how many of you have ever
17.173	gotten behind the wheel of a car
18.828	when you really shouldn't have been driving?
24.515	Maybe you're out on the road for a long day,
26.42	and you just wanted to get home.
27.91	You were tired, but you felt you could drive a few more miles.
30.557	Maybe you thought,
31.756	I've had less to drink than everybody else,
33.773	I should be the one to go home.
35.509	Or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere.
40.1	Does this sound familiar to you?
41.554	Now, in those situations, wouldn't it be great
44.452	if there was a button on your dashboard
46.045	that you could push, and the car would get you home safely?
52.388	Now, that's been the promise of the self-driving car,
54.681	the autonomous vehicle, and it's been the dream
57.308	since at least 1939, when General Motors showcased
60.557	this idea at their Futurama booth at the World's Fair.
63.859	Now, it's been one of those dreams
65.802	that's always seemed about 20 years in the future.
70.016	Now, two weeks ago, that dream took a step forward,
72.699	when the state of Nevada granted Google's self-driving car
75.964	the very first license for an autonomous vehicle,
79.564	clearly establishing that it's legal for them
81.809	to test it on the roads in Nevada.
83.619	Now, California's considering similar legislation,
87.346	and this would make sure that the autonomous car
89.754	is not one of those things that has to stay in Vegas.
92.731	(Laughter)
94.827	Now, in my lab at Stanford, we've been working on
98.611	autonomous cars too, but with a slightly different spin
102.098	on things. You see, we've been developing robotic race cars,
106.346	cars that can actually push themselves to the very limits
110.466	of physical performance.
112.706	Now, why would we want to do such a thing?
115.319	Well, there's two really good reasons for this.
117.419	First, we believe that before people turn over control
121.378	to an autonomous car, that autonomous car should be
124.212	at least as good as the very best human drivers.
127.466	Now, if you're like me, and the other 70 percent of the population
130.771	who know that we are above-average drivers,
132.964	you understand that's a very high bar.
136.139	There's another reason as well.
138.531	Just like race car drivers can use all of the friction
142.107	between the tire and the road,
143.387	all of the car's capabilities to go as fast as possible,
146.564	we want to use all of those capabilities to avoid
149.909	any accident we can.
151.497	Now, you may push the car to the limits
153.547	not because you're driving too fast,
155.514	but because you've hit an icy patch of road,
157.674	conditions have changed.
159.378	In those situations, we want a car
162.139	that is capable enough to avoid any accident
165.859	that can physically be avoided.
168.537	I must confess, there's kind of a third motivation as well.
172.804	You see, I have a passion for racing.
175.06	In the past, I've been a race car owner,
177.824	a crew chief and a driving coach,
180.379	although maybe not at the level that you're currently expecting.
184.234	One of the things that we've developed in the lab --
186.938	we've developed several vehicles --
188.642	is what we believe is the world's first
190.877	autonomously drifting car.
193.242	It's another one of those categories
195.755	where maybe there's not a lot of competition.
198.178	(Laughter)
199.586	But this is P1. It's an entirely student-built electric vehicle,
203.408	which through using its rear-wheel drive
205.486	and front-wheel steer-by-wire
207.051	can drift around corners.
209.118	It can get sideways like a rally car driver,
211.318	always able to take the tightest curve,
213.033	even on slippery, changing surfaces,
216.337	never spinning out.
217.953	We've also worked with Volkswagen Oracle,
220.321	on Shelley, an autonomous race car that has raced
223.745	at 150 miles an hour through the Bonneville Salt Flats,
226.815	gone around Thunderhill Raceway Park in the sun,
231.286	the wind and the rain,
233.925	and navigated the 153 turns and 12.4 miles
238.943	of the Pikes Peak Hill Climb route
240.505	in Colorado with nobody at the wheel.
243.978	(Laughter)
245.426	(Applause)
250.992	I guess it goes without saying that we've had a lot of fun
254.271	doing this.
255.575	But in fact, there's something else that we've developed
259.232	in the process of developing these autonomous cars.
262.287	We have developed a tremendous appreciation
266.158	for the capabilities of human race car drivers.
269.975	As we've looked at the question of how well do these cars perform,
274.32	we wanted to compare them to our human counterparts.
277.599	And we discovered their human counterparts are amazing.
283.279	Now, we can take a map of a race track,
287.302	we can take a mathematical model of a car,
289.672	and with some iteration, we can actually find
292.575	the fastest way around that track.
294.2	We line that up with data that we record
296.733	from a professional driver,
298.166	and the resemblance is absolutely remarkable.
302.273	Yes, there are subtle differences here,
305.485	but the human race car driver is able to go out
308.612	and drive an amazingly fast line,
310.947	without the benefit of an algorithm that compares
313.277	the trade-off between going as fast as possible
315.885	in this corner, and shaving a little bit of time
317.922	off of the straight over here.
319.824	Not only that, they're able to do it lap
323.281	after lap after lap.
325.656	They're able to go out and consistently do this,
328.568	pushing the car to the limits every single time.
332.696	It's extraordinary to watch.
335.865	You put them in a new car,
337.931	and after a few laps, they've found the fastest line in that car,
341.833	and they're off to the races.
345.71	It really makes you think,
346.856	we'd love to know what's going on inside their brain.
351.727	So as researchers, that's what we decided to find out.
356.268	We decided to instrument not only the car,
358.08	but also the race car driver,
360.575	to try to get a glimpse into what was going on
363.344	in their head as they were doing this.
365.53	Now, this is Dr. Lene Harbott applying electrodes
369.48	to the head of John Morton.
370.712	John Morton is a former Can-Am and IMSA driver,
373.701	who's also a class champion at Le Mans.
375.501	Fantastic driver, and very willing to put up with graduate students
378.997	and this sort of research.
380.852	She's putting electrodes on his head
383.524	so that we can monitor the electrical activity
385.636	in John's brain as he races around the track.
388.468	Now, clearly we're not going to put a couple of electrodes on his head
391.663	and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track.
394.933	However, neuroscientists have identified certain patterns
398.34	that let us tease out some very important aspects of this.
402.101	For instance, the resting brain
403.948	tends to generate a lot of alpha waves.
406.103	In contrast, theta waves are associated with
409.855	a lot of cognitive activity, like visual processing,
413.039	things where the driver is thinking quite a bit.
416.087	Now, we can measure this,
417.75	and we can look at the relative power
419.735	between the theta waves and the alpha waves.
421.935	This gives us a measure of mental workload,
424.377	how much the driver is actually challenged cognitively
427.944	at any point along the track.
429.73	Now, we wanted to see if we could actually record this
432.672	on the track, so we headed down south to Laguna Seca.
435.71	Laguna Seca is a legendary raceway
437.726	about halfway between Salinas and Monterey.
440.027	It has a curve there called the Corkscrew.
442.114	Now, the Corkscrew is a chicane, followed by a quick
444.831	right-handed turn as the road drops three stories.
447.577	Now, the strategy for driving this as explained to me was,
451.343	you aim for the bush in the distance,
453.365	and as the road falls away, you realize it was actually the top of a tree.
456.39	All right, so thanks to the Revs Program at Stanford,
459.694	we were able to take John there
461.167	and put him behind the wheel
462.131	of a 1960 Porsche Abarth Carrera.
464.57	Life is way too short for boring cars.
468.268	So, here you see John on the track,
470.027	he's going up the hill -- Oh! Somebody liked that --
472.211	and you can see, actually, his mental workload
474.676	-- measuring here in the red bar --
476.829	you can see his actions as he approaches.
479.172	Now watch, he has to downshift.
482.402	And then he has to turn left.
483.163	Look for the tree, and down.
487.156	Not surprisingly, you can see this is a pretty challenging task.
489.994	You can see his mental workload spike as he goes through this,
492.97	as you would expect with something that requires
495.034	this level of complexity.
497.843	But what's really interesting is to look at areas of the track
501.259	where his mental workload doesn't increase.
504.105	I'm going to take you around now
505.6	to the other side of the track.
506.689	Turn three. And John's going to go into that corner
509.025	and the rear end of the car is going to begin to slide out.
511.576	He's going to have to correct for that with steering.
513.593	So watch as John does this here.
515.824	Watch the mental workload, and watch the steering.
518.146	The car begins to slide out, dramatic maneuver to correct it,
521.818	and no change whatsoever in the mental workload.
525.341	Not a challenging task.
528.173	In fact, entirely reflexive.
531.373	Now, our data processing on this is still preliminary,
535.016	but it really seems that these phenomenal feats
537.688	that the race car drivers are performing
539.298	are instinctive.
541.208	They are things that they have simply learned to do.
544.598	It requires very little mental workload
546.88	for them to perform these amazing feats.
549.704	And their actions are fantastic.
552.839	This is exactly what you want to do on the steering wheel
555.45	to catch the car in this situation.
558.787	Now, this has given us tremendous insight
562.232	and inspiration for our own autonomous vehicles.
565.354	We've started to ask the question:
567.282	Can we make them a little less algorithmic
569.535	and a little more intuitive?
571.984	Can we take this reflexive action
574.265	that we see from the very best race car drivers,
576.552	introduce it to our cars,
578.201	and maybe even into a system that could
580.185	get onto your car in the future?
582.153	That would take us a long step
583.764	along the road to autonomous vehicles
586.273	that drive as well as the best humans.
588.185	But it's made us think a little bit more deeply as well.
591.625	Do we want something more from our car
594.593	than to simply be a chauffeur?
596.433	Do we want our car to perhaps be a partner, a coach,
600.668	someone that can use their understanding of the situation
603.755	to help us reach our potential?
608.011	Can, in fact, the technology not simply replace humans,
610.284	but allow us to reach the level of reflex and intuition
614.859	that we're all capable of?
618.284	So, as we move forward into this technological future,
620.207	I want you to just pause and think of that for a moment.
623.028	What is the ideal balance of human and machine?
626.803	And as we think about that,
628.512	let's take inspiration
630.243	from the absolutely amazing capabilities
633.572	of the human body and the human mind.
636.388	Thank you.
638.124	(Applause)
