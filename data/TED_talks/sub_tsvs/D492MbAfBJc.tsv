146.33	♫ to feel the power, the power in your soul, no. ♫

254.33	This is a song that came about
258.33	because I think it's difficult to be in the world
262.33	and not be aware of what's going on,
264.33	and the wars and so forth.
269.33	This song kind of came out of all of that.
273.33	And I wrote a lot of happy songs on my first record,
280.33	which I still stand by,
282.33	but this has got something else in it.
284.33	"It's called ""Peace on Earth."""
303.33	♫ There is no hope. ♫
306.33	♫ There is no future. ♫
309.33	♫ No faith in God to save the day. ♫
313.33	♫ There is no reason, no understanding ♫
317.33	♫ no sacred place to hide away. ♫
321.33	♫ There is no earnest conversation. ♫
326.33	♫ No words of wisdom from the wise. ♫
330.33	♫ There is no reconciliation ♫
334.33	♫ and no collective compromise. ♫
339.33	♫ Peace on Earth, ♫
341.33	♫ that's what we want. ♫
343.33	♫ Peace on Earth, ♫
345.33	♫ that's what we all say. ♫
348.33	♫ Peace on Earth. ♫
350.33	♫ Yet, there in the hallway ♫
354.33	♫ lurks the ghost of war. ♫
362.33	♫ He wants more, and more, and more, and more, ♫
367.33	♫ and more, and more, and more, and more. ♫
372.33	♫ There is no darkness, no sunshine. ♫
375.33	♫ There is no great society. ♫
379.33	♫ There is no freedom without conviction. ♫
384.33	♫ There is no freedom to be free. ♫
388.33	♫ There is no heaven, no fire and brimstone. ♫
392.33	♫ There is no brotherhood of man. ♫
397.33	♫ There is no country, no one religion. ♫
401.33	♫ There is no universal plan. ♫
405.33	♫ Peace on Earth, ♫
408.33	♫ that's what we want. ♫
410.33	♫ Peace on Earth, ♫
412.33	♫ that's what we all say. ♫
414.33	♫ Peace on Earth. ♫
416.33	♫ Yet, there in the hallway ♫
421.33	♫ lurks the ghost of war. ♫
427.33	♫ He wants more, and more, and more, and more, ♫
434.33	♫ and more, and more, and more, and more, and more. ♫
437.33	♫ The answer is ♫
439.33	♫ mutual-assured destruction, ♫
448.33	♫ a balance of power, ♫
452.33	♫ a weapon for everyone. ♫
455.33	♫ Mutual-assured destruction ♫
463.33	♫ bringing peace to everyone. ♫
478.33	(Trumpet sounds)
487.33	(Trumpet sounds)
526.33	♫ Peace on Earth, ♫
