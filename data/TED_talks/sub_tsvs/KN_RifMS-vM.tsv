12.569	I'm McKenna Pope. I'm 14 years old,
15.113	and when I was 13, I convinced
17.102	one of the largest toy companies,
18.832	toymakers, in the world, Hasbro,
21.235	to change the way that they marketed
23.193	one of their most best-selling products.
25.319	So allow me to tell you about it.
26.639	So I have a brother, Gavin.
28.456	When this whole shebang happened, he was four.
30.875	He loved to cook.
32.388	He was always getting ingredients out of the fridge
34.606	and mixing them into these, needless to say,
36.746	uneatable concoctions,
38.135	or making invisible macaroni and cheese.
41.176	He wanted to be a chef really badly.
44.325	And so what better gift for a kid
44.325	who wanted to be a chef
47.69	than an Easy-Bake Oven. Right?
49.93	I mean, we all had those when we were little.
51.773	And he wanted one so badly.
53.913	But then he started to realize something.
56.532	In the commercials, and on the 
56.532	boxes for the Easy-Bake Ovens,
60.093	Hasbro marketed them specifically to girls.
63.324	And the way that they did this
64.829	was they would only feature girls
64.829	on the boxes or in the commercials,
67.935	and there would be flowery prints all over the ovens
70.314	and it would be in bright pink and purple,
73.267	very gender-specific colors to females, right?
76.608	So it kind of was sending a message
79.193	that only girls are supposed to cook; boys aren't.
82.158	And this discouraged my brother a lot.
83.731	He thought that he wasn't
83.731	supposed to want to be a chef,
87.308	because that was something that girls did.
89.165	Girls cooked; boys didn't,
90.67	or so was the message that Hasbro was sending.
93.16	And this got me thinking,
95.146	God, I wish there was a way that I could change this,
97.387	that could I have my voice heard by Hasbro
100.393	so I could ask them and tell them
102.17	what they were doing wrong
103.489	and ask them to change it.
104.882	And that got me thinking about a website
106.7	that I had learned about a few months prior
108.171	called Change.org.
109.718	Change.org is an online petition-sharing platform
113.051	where you can create a petition and share it
115.498	across all of these social media networks,
117.781	through Facebook, through Twitter,
119.223	through YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr,
120.777	through whatever you can think of.
122.646	And so I created a petition
124.428	along with the YouTube video
124.428	that I added to the petition
127.642	basically asking Hasbro
129.668	to change the way that they marketed it,
131.915	in featuring boys in the commercials, on the boxes,
134.938	and most of all creating them
136.898	in less gender-specific colors.
139.622	So this petition started to take off --
143.02	humongously fast, you have no idea.
146.387	I was getting interviewed by
146.387	all these national news outlets
149.776	and press outlets, and it was amazing.
153.352	In three weeks, maybe three and a half,
155.968	I had 46,000 signatures on this petition.
160.777	(Applause)
162.975	Thank you.
164.749	So, needless to say, it was crazy.
167.126	Eventually, Hasbro themselves
167.126	invited me to their headquarters
171.732	so they could go and unveil
173.33	their new Easy-Bake Oven product to me
175.778	in black, silver and blue.
177.634	It was literally one of the best moments of my life.
180.484	It was like &amp;quot;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.&amp;quot;
182.527	That thing was amazing.
184.413	What I didn't realize at the time, however,
186.083	was that I had become an activist,
188.01	I could change something,
189.584	that even as a kid, or maybe 
189.584	even especially as a kid,
192.591	my voice mattered, and your voice matters too.
195.421	I want to let you know it's not going to be easy,
197.022	and it wasn't easy for me,
198.438	because I faced a lot of obstacles.
201.25	People online, and sometimes even in real life,
204.981	were disrespectful to me and my family,
207.893	and talked about how the whole
207.893	thing was a waste of time,
210.524	and it really discouraged me.
211.988	And actually, I have some examples,
211.988	because what's better revenge
215.195	than displaying their idiocy?
217.746	So, let's see.
219.535	From user name Liquidsore29 --
222.259	interesting user names we have hereâ€”
224.268	&amp;quot;Disgusting liberal moms making their sons gay.&amp;quot;
230.048	Liquidsore29, really? Really? Okay.
232.803	How about from Whiteboy77AGS:
236.643	"""People always need something"
236.643	"to (female dog) about."""
240.792	From Jeffrey Gutierrez:
243.082	&amp;quot;OMG, shut up. You just want money and attention.&amp;quot;
246.098	So it was comments like these
248.371	that really discouraged me from
248.371	wanting to make change in the future
251.171	because I thought, people don't care,
253.628	people think it's a waste of time,
256.034	and people are going to be disrespectful 
256.034	to me and my family.
259.893	It hurt me, and it made me think,
262.316	what's the point of making change in the future?
264.798	But then I started to realize something.
267.455	Haters gonna hate.
269.896	Come on, say it with me. One, two, three:
271.67	Haters gonna hate.
274.138	So let your haters hate,
276.02	you know what, and make your change,
277.704	because I know you can.
279.545	I look out into this crowd,
280.967	and I see 400 people
283.233	who came out because they wanted to know
283.233	how they could make a change,
286.478	and I know that you can, and all
286.478	of you watching at home can too
289.025	because you have so much that you 
289.025	can do and that you believe in,
292.697	and you can trade it across all these social media,
295.515	through Facebook, through Twitter, through 
295.515	YouTube, through Reddit, through Tumblr,
298.401	through whatever else you can think of.
300.291	And you can make that change.
301.747	You can take what you believe in
303.168	and turn it into a cause and change it.
305.549	And that spark that you've been 
305.549	hearing about all day today,
308.617	you can use that spark that you have within you
311.253	and turn it into a fire.
312.773	Thank you.
314.549	(Applause)
