26	I really am honored to be here, and as Chris said,
28	it's been over 20 years since I started working in Africa.
31	My first introduction was at the Abidjan airport on a sweaty, Ivory Coast morning.
37	I had just left Wall Street, cut my hair to look like Margaret Mead,
41	given away most everything that I owned,
43	and arrived with all the essentials --
45	some poetry, a few clothes, and, of course, a guitar --
47	because I was going to save the world,
49	and I thought I would just start with the African continent.
55	But literally within days of arriving I was told, in no uncertain terms,
59	by a number of West African women, that Africans didn't want saving,
64	thank you very much, least of all not by me.
66	I was too young, unmarried, I had no children,
69	didn't really know Africa, and besides, my French was pitiful.
73	And so, it was an incredibly painful time in my life,
76	and yet it really started to give me the humility to start listening.
81	I think that failure can be an incredibly motivating force as well,
85	so I moved to Kenya and worked in Uganda,
88	and I met a group of Rwandan women, who asked me, in 1986,
91	to move to Kigali to help them start the first microfinance institution there.
95	And I did, and we ended up naming it Duterimbere,
99	"meaning ""to go forward with enthusiasm."" And while we were doing it,"
102	I realized that there weren't a lot of businesses that were viable
105	and started by women, and so maybe I should try to run a business, too.
109	And so I started looking around, and I heard about a bakery
111	that was run by 20 prostitutes.
113	And, being a little intrigued, I went to go meet this group,
117	and what I found was 20 unwed mothers who were trying to survive.
122	And it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language,
127	and how what we call people so often distances us from them,
130	and makes them little.
132	I also found out that the bakery was nothing like a business,
136	that, in fact, it was a classic charity run by a well-intentioned person,
140	who essentially spent 600 dollars a month
144	to keep these 20 women busy making little crafts and baked goods,
149	and living on 50 cents a day, still in poverty.
152	"So, I made a deal with the women. I said, ""Look, we get rid of the charity side,"
155	"and we run this as a business and I'll help you."""
158	They nervously agreed. I nervously started, and, of course,
162	things are always harder than you think they're going to be.
164	First of all, I thought, well, we need a sales team,
166	and we clearly aren't the A-Team here,
168	so let's -- I did all this training.
171	And the epitome was when I literally marched into the streets
175	of Nyamirambo, which is the popular quarter of Kigali, with a bucket,
178	and I sold all these little doughnuts to people,
181	"and I came back, and I was like, ""You see?"""
183	"And the women said, ""You know, Jacqueline, who in Nyamirambo is not going to buy"
187	"doughnuts out of an orange bucket from a tall American woman?"" And like --"
191	(Laughter) -- it's a good point.
193	So then I went the whole American way,
195	with competitions, team and individual. Completely failed,
198	but over time, the women learnt to sell on their own way.
202	And they started listening to the marketplace,
204	and they came back with ideas for cassava chips, and banana chips,
207	and sorghum bread, and before you knew it,
209	we had cornered the Kigali market,
211	and the women were earning three to four times the national average.
214	"And with that confidence surge, I thought, ""Well, it's time to create a real bakery,"
218	"so let's paint it."" And the women said, ""That's a really great idea."""
222	"And I said, ""Well, what color do you want to paint it?"" And they said,"
224	"""Well, you choose."" And I said, ""No, no, I'm learning to listen."
227	"You choose. It's your bakery, your street, your country -- not mine."""
230	But they wouldn't give me an answer.
232	So, one week, two weeks, three weeks went by,
234	"and finally I said, ""Well, how about blue?"""
237	"And they said, ""Blue, blue, we love blue. Let's do it blue."""
239	So, I went to the store, I brought Gaudence, the recalcitrant one of all,
243	and we brought all this paint and fabric to make curtains,
247	and on painting day, we all gathered in Nyamirambo,
250	and the idea was we would paint it white with blue as trim,
253	like a little French bakery. But that was clearly not as satisfying
256	as painting a wall of blue like a morning sky.
259	So, blue, blue, everything became blue.
262	The walls were blue, the windows were blue,
263	the sidewalk out front was painted blue.
266	"And Aretha Franklin was shouting ""R-E-S-P-E-C-T,"""
270	the women's hips were swaying
272	and little kids were trying to grab the paintbrushes, but it was their day.
275	And at the end of it, we stood across the street
278	"and we looked at what we had done, and I said, ""It is so beautiful."""
281	"And the women said, ""It really is."""
283	"And I said, ""And I think the color is perfect,"""
286	and they all nodded their head, except for Gaudence,
288	"and I said, ""What?"""
290	"And she said, ""Nothing."" And I said, ""What?"""
292	"And she said, ""Well, it is pretty, but, you know, our color, really, it is green."" And --"
298	(Laughter)
301	-- I learned then that listening isn't just about patience,
306	but that when you've lived on charity and dependent your whole life long,
311	it's really hard to say what you mean.
313	And, mostly because people never really ask you,
317	and when they do, you don't really think they want to know the truth.
320	And so then I learned that listening is not only about waiting,
323	but it's also learning how better to ask questions.
327	And so, I lived in Kigali for about two and a half years, doing these two things,
331	and it was an extraordinary time in my life.
333	And it taught me three lessons
335	that I think are so important for us today,
338	and certainly in the work that I do.
340	The first is that dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.
344	As Eleni has said, when people gain income, they gain choice,
348	and that is fundamental to dignity.
350	But as human beings, we also want to see each other,
353	and we want to be heard by each other, and we should never forget that.
357	The second is that traditional charity and aid
360	are never going to solve the problems of poverty.
362	I think Andrew pretty well covered that, so I will move to the third point,
365	which is that markets alone also
367	are not going to solve the problems of poverty.
370	Yes, we ran this as a business,
372	but someone needed to pay the philanthropic support
377	that came into the training, and the management support, the strategic advice
380	and, maybe most important of all,
383	the access to new contacts, networks and new markets.
387	And so, on a micro level, there's a real role for this combination
391	of investment and philanthropy.
394	And on a macro level -- some of the speakers have inferred that
398	even health should be privatized.
400	But, having had a father with heart disease,
402	and realizing that what our family could afford
406	was not what he should have gotten,
409	and having a good friend step in to help,
412	I really believe that all people deserve access to health
415	at prices they can afford.
417	I think the market can help us figure that out,
419	but there's got to be a charitable component,
421	or I don't think we're going to create the kind of societies we want to live in.
425	And so, it was really those lessons that made me decide to
428	build Acumen Fund about six years ago.
431	It's a nonprofit, venture capital fund for the poor,
434	a few oxymorons in one sentence.
436	It essentially raises charitable funds from individuals, foundations and corporations,
441	and then we turn around and we invest equity and loans
443	in both for-profit and nonprofit entities
445	that deliver affordable health, housing, energy, clean water
449	to low income people in South Asia and Africa,
452	so that they can make their own choices.
454	We've invested about 20 million dollars in 20 different enterprises,
458	and have, in so doing, created nearly 20,000 jobs,
463	and delivered tens of millions of services to people
465	who otherwise would not be able to afford them.
469	I want to tell you two stories. Both of them are in Africa.
472	Both of them are about investing in entrepreneurs
474	who are committed to service, and who really know the markets.
478	Both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise,
482	and both of them, because they're manufacturers,
484	create jobs directly, and create incomes indirectly,
487	because they're in the malaria sector,
489	and Africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year because of malaria.
494	And so as people get healthier, they also get wealthier.
498	The first one is called Advanced Bio-Extracts Limited.
501	It's a company built in Kenya about seven years ago
503	by an incredible entrepreneur named Patrick Henfrey and his three colleagues.
507	These are old-hand farmers
509	who've gone through all the agricultural ups and downs
511	in Kenya over the last 30 years.
513	Now, this plant is an Artemisia plant;
516	it's the basic component for artemisinin,
518	which is the best-known treatment for malaria.
520	It's indigenous to China and the Far East,
524	but given that the prevalence of malaria is here in Africa,
526	"Patrick and his colleagues said, ""Let's bring it here,"
530	"because it's a high value-add product."""
532	The farmers get three to four times the yields that they would with maize.
538	And so, using patient capital -- money that they could raise early on,
542	that actually got below market returns
544	and was willing to go the long haul and be combined
548	with management assistance, strategic assistance --
551	they've now created a company where they purchase from 7,500 farmers.
555	So that's about 50,000 people affected.
557	And I think some of you may have visited --
559	these farmers are helped by KickStart and TechnoServe,
562	who help them become more self-sufficient.
564	They buy it, they dry it and they bring it to this factory,
567	which was purchased in part by, again, patient capital from Novartis,
571	who has a real interest in getting the powder
574	so that they can make Coartem.
577	Acumen's been working with ABE for the past year, year and a half,
582	both on looking at a new business plan,
584	and what does expansion look like, helping with management support
587	and helping to do term sheets and raise capital.
591	And I really understood what patient capital meant emotionally
594	in the last month or so. Because the company was literally
602	was at the world-quality level needed to make Coartem,
606	when they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history.
609	And we called all of the social investors we know.
612	Now, some of these same social investors are really interested in Africa
616	and understand the importance of agriculture,
618	and they even helped the farmers.
621	And even when we explained that if ABE goes away,
624	all those 7,500 jobs go away too,
628	we sometimes have this bifurcation between business and the social.
633	And it's really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused.
637	So Acumen made not one, but two bridge loans,
640	and the good news is they did indeed meet world-quality classification and are now
646	in the final stages of closing a 20-million-dollar round, to move it to the next level,
650	and I think that this will be one of the more important companies in East Africa.
656	This is Samuel. He's a farmer.
658	He was actually living in the Kibera slums
660	when his father called him and told him about Artemisia and the value-add potential.
665	So he moved back to the farm, and, long story short,
668	they now have seven acres under cultivation.
671	Samuel's kids are in private school,
673	and he's starting to help other farmers in the area also go into Artemisia production --
679	dignity being more important than wealth.
682	The next one, many of you know.
685	I talked about it a little at Oxford two years ago,
688	and some of you visited A to Z manufacturing,
690	which is one of the great, real companies in East Africa.
694	It's another one that lives at the confluence of health and enterprise.
699	And this is really a story about a public-private solution
703	that has really worked.
705	It started in Japan. Sumitomo had developed a technology
709	essentially to impregnate a polyethylene-based fiber with organic insecticide,
713	so you could create a bed net,
715	a malaria bed net, that would last five years and not need to be re-dipped.
718	It could alter the vector, but like Artemisia,
721	it had been produced only in East Asia. And as part of its social responsibility,
725	"Sumitomo said, ""Why don't we experiment"
727	"with whether we can produce it in Africa, for Africans?"""
730	"UNICEF came forward and said, ""We'll buy most of the nets,"
733	and then we'll give them away, as part of the global fund's
736	"and the U.N.'s commitment to pregnant women and children, for free."""
742	Acumen came in with the patient capital,
745	and we also helped to identify the entrepreneur
747	that we would all partner with here in Africa,
750	and Exxon provided the initial resin.
753	Well, in looking around for entrepreneurs,
755	there was none better that we could find on earth than Anuj Shah,
758	in A to Z manufacturing company.
760	It's a 40-year-old company, it understands manufacturing.
763	It's gone from socialist Tanzania into capitalist Tanzania,
766	and continued to flourish. It had about 1,000 employees when we first found it.
771	And so, Anuj took the entrepreneurial risk here in Africa
774	to produce a public good that was purchased by the aid establishment
779	to work with malaria.
782	And, long story short, again, they've been so successful.
785	In our first year, the first net went off the line in October of 2003.
790	We thought the hitting-it-out-of-the-box number was 150,000 nets a year.
795	This year, they are now producing eight million nets a year,
798	and they employ 5,000 people, 90 percent of whom are women, mostly unskilled.
803	They're in a joint venture with Sumitomo.
806	And so, from an enterprise perspective for Africa,
809	and from a public health perspective, these are real successes.
812	But it's only half the story if we're really looking at solving problems of poverty,
816	because it's not long-term sustainable.
818	It's a company with one big customer.
820	And if avian flu hits, or for any other reason
824	the world decides that malaria is no longer as much of a priority, everybody loses.
829	And so, Anuj and Acumen
832	have been talking about testing the private sector,
835	because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that,
840	look, in a country like Tanzania,
844	It costs, at manufacturing point, six dollars to produce these,
848	and it costs the establishment another six dollars to distribute it,
853	so the market price in a free market would be about 12 dollars per net.
857	Most people can't afford that, so let's give it away free.
859	"And we said, ""Well, there's another option."
862	Let's use the market as the best listening device we have, and
865	understand at what price people would pay for this, so they get the dignity of choice.
870	We can start building local distribution,
872	"and actually, it can cost the public sector much less."""
876	And so we came in with a second round of patient capital to A to Z,
880	a loan as well as a grant, so that A to Z could play with pricing
884	and listen to the marketplace, and found a number of things.
887	One, that people will pay different prices,
889	but the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net
893	and make a decision to buy it.
895	And when you listen to them, they'll also have a lot to say
898	about what they like and what they don't like.
900	And that some of the channels we thought would work didn't work.
904	But because of this experimentation and iteration that was allowed
907	because of the patient capital,
909	we've now found that it costs about a dollar in the private sector
912	to distribute, and a dollar to buy the net.
914	So then, from a policy perspective, when you start with the market,
918	we have a choice.
919	We can continue going along at 12 dollars a net, and the customer pays zero,
925	or we could at least experiment with some of it, to charge one dollar a net,
931	costing the public sector another six dollars a net,
934	give the people the dignity of choice, and have a distribution system
938	that might, over time, start sustaining itself.
941	We've got to start having conversations like this,
943	and I don't think there's any better way to start than using the market,
947	but also to bring other people to the table around it.
951	Whenever I go to visit A to Z, I think of my grandmother, Stella.
958	She was very much like those women sitting behind the sewing machines.
963	She grew up on a farm in Austria, very poor,
965	didn't have very much education.
967	She moved to the United States, where she met my grandfather,
969	who was a cement hauler,
971	and they had nine children. Three of them died as babies.
977	My grandmother had tuberculosis, and she worked in a sewing machine shop,
980	making shirts for about 10 cents an hour.
983	She, like so many of the women I see at A to Z,
987	worked hard every day, understood what suffering was,
990	had a deep faith in God, loved her children
993	and would never have accepted a handout.
996	But because she had the opportunity of the marketplace,
1000	and she lived in a society that provided the safety
1003	of having access to affordable health and education,
1007	her children and their children were able to live
1011	lives of real purpose and follow real dreams.
1014	I look around at my siblings and my cousins -- and as I said,
1018	there are a lot of us --
1020	and I see teachers and musicians, hedge fund managers, designers.
1026	One sister who makes other people's wishes come true.
1029	And my wish, when I see those women, I meet those farmers,
1034	and I think about all the people across this continent
1037	who are working hard every day,
1039	is that they have that sense of opportunity and possibility,
1043	and that they also can believe and get access to services,
1048	so that their children, too, can live those lives of great purpose.
1052	It shouldn't be that difficult.
1054	But what it takes is a commitment from all of us
1058	to essentially refuse trite assumptions,
1062	get out of our ideological boxes.
1065	It takes investing in those entrepreneurs that are committed
1068	to service as well as to success.
1072	It takes opening your arms, both, wide,
1075	and expecting very little love in return,
1078	but demanding accountability,
1080	and bringing the accountability to the table as well.
1083	And most of all, most of all,
1086	it requires that all of us have the courage and the patience,
1090	whether we are rich or poor, African or non-African,
1093	local or diaspora, left or right,
1096	to really start listening to each other.
1098	Thank you.
1100	(Applause)
