26.61	When you have 21 minutes to speak,
28.595	two million years seems
28.595	like a really long time.
31.595	But evolutionarily,
31.595	two million years is nothing.
34.065	And yet in two million years,
36.042	the human brain
36.042	has nearly tripled in mass,
39.821	going from the one-and-a-quarter pound
39.821	brain of our ancestor here, Habilis,
44.054	to the almost three-pound meatloaf
45.84	that everybody here
45.84	has between their ears.
49.512	What is it about a big brain
52.931	that nature was so eager
52.931	for every one of us to have one?
56.712	Well, it turns out when
56.712	brains triple in size,
58.971	they don't just get three times bigger;
58.971	they gain new structures.
62.51	And one of the main reasons our brain got
62.51	so big is because it got a new part,
67.42	"called the ""frontal lobe."""
68.776	Particularly, a part called
68.776	"the ""pre-frontal cortex."""
71.893	What does a pre-frontal cortex
71.893	do for you that should justify
75.36	the entire architectural overhaul
75.36	of the human skull
78.964	in the blink of evolutionary time?
80.751	It turns out the pre-frontal
80.751	cortex does lots of things,
83.791	but one of the most important things
83.791	it does is an experience simulator.
89.705	Pilots practice in flight simulators
92.057	so that they don't make
92.057	real mistakes in planes.
94.997	Human beings have this
94.997	marvelous adaptation
97.617	that they can actually have
97.617	experiences in their heads
101.386	before they try them out in real life.
103.601	This is a trick that none
103.601	of our ancestors could do,
106.148	and that no other animal
106.148	can do quite like we can.
109.413	It's a marvelous adaptation.
110.967	It's up there with opposable thumbs
110.967	and standing upright and language
114.858	as one of the things that got
114.858	our species out of the trees
118.302	and into the shopping mall.
120.479	(Laughter)
122.415	All of you have done this.
123.719	Ben and Jerry's doesn't have
123.719	liver-and-onion ice cream,
127.576	and it's not because they whipped
127.576	"some up, tried it and went, ""Yuck."""
131.008	It's because, without
131.008	leaving your armchair,
134.054	you can simulate that flavor
134.054	"and say ""yuck"" before you make it."
140.652	Let's see how your experience
140.652	simulators are working.
143.248	Let's just run a quick diagnostic
145.111	before I proceed
145.111	with the rest of the talk.
147.273	Here's two different futures
147.273	that I invite you to contemplate.
151.012	You can try to simulate them and tell me
151.012	which one you think you might prefer.
155.062	One of them is winning the lottery.
155.062	This is about 314 million dollars.
160.62	And the other is becoming paraplegic.
163.524	(Laughter)
164.566	Just give it a moment of thought.
166.218	You probably don't feel
166.218	like you need a moment of thought.
169.053	Interestingly, there are data
169.053	on these two groups of people,
173.195	data on how happy they are.
175.197	And this is exactly
175.197	what you expected, isn't it?
178.24	But these aren't the data.
178.24	I made these up!
181.038	These are the data.
182.714	You failed the pop quiz, and you're hardly
182.714	five minutes into the lecture.
186.234	Because the fact is that a year
186.234	after losing the use of their legs,
190.43	and a year after winning the lotto,
190.43	lottery winners and paraplegics
195.181	are equally happy with their lives.
198.356	Don't feel too bad
198.356	about failing the first pop quiz,
200.836	because everybody fails
200.836	all of the pop quizzes all of the time.
204.795	The research that my laboratory
204.795	has been doing,
207.208	that economists and psychologists
207.208	around the country have been doing,
210.565	has revealed something
210.565	really quite startling to us,
213.385	"something we call the ""impact bias,"""
215.254	which is the tendency
215.254	for the simulator to work badly.
218.795	For the simulator to make you
218.795	believe that different outcomes
223.018	are more different
223.018	than in fact they really are.
225.401	From field studies to laboratory studies,
227.708	we see that winning or losing an election,
227.708	gaining or losing a romantic partner,
232.471	getting or not getting a promotion,
232.471	passing or not passing a college test,
236.322	on and on, have far less impact,
236.322	less intensity and much less duration
242.244	than people expect them to have.
246.014	This almost floors me --
251.085	a recent study showing
251.085	how major life traumas affect people
255.595	suggests that if it happened
255.595	over three months ago,
258.595	with only a few exceptions,
260.181	it has no impact whatsoever
260.181	on your happiness.
264.798	Why?
266.488	Because happiness can be synthesized.
270.145	Sir Thomas Brown wrote in 1642,
270.145	"""I am the happiest man alive."
274.455	I have that in me that can convert poverty
274.455	to riches, adversity to prosperity.
279.595	I am more invulnerable than Achilles;
279.595	"fortune hath not one place to hit me."""
284.565	What kind of remarkable machinery
284.565	does this guy have in his head?
287.778	Well, it turns out it's precisely the same
287.778	remarkable machinery that all off us have.
293.775	Human beings have something
295.663	that we might think of
295.663	"as a ""psychological immune system."""
298.928	A system of cognitive processes, largely
298.928	non-conscious cognitive processes,
303.945	that help them change
303.945	their views of the world,
307.403	so that they can feel better
308.824	about the worlds
308.824	in which they find themselves.
311.776	Like Sir Thomas, you have this machine.
313.666	Unlike Sir Thomas,
313.666	you seem not to know it.
318.486	We synthesize happiness, but we think
318.486	happiness is a thing to be found.
323.595	Now, you don't need me to give you
325.293	too many examples of people
325.293	synthesizing happiness, I suspect.
329.405	Though I'm going to show
329.405	you some experimental evidence,
332.053	you don't have to look
332.053	very far for evidence.
334.221	I took a copy of the New York Times
335.916	and tried to find some instances
335.916	of people synthesizing happiness.
339.124	Here are three guys
339.124	synthesizing happiness.
341.161	"""I'm better off physically,"
341.161	financially, mentally ...
343.866	"""I don't have one minute's regret."
343.866	"It was a glorious experience."""
346.939	"""I believe it turned out for the best."""
348.894	Who are these characters
348.894	who are so damn happy?
351.167	The first one is Jim Wright.
352.561	Some of you are old enough to remember:
354.456	he was the chairman
354.456	of the House of Representatives
356.943	and he resigned in disgrace
358.339	when this young Republican
358.339	named Newt Gingrich
360.518	found out about a shady
360.518	book deal he had done.
362.686	He lost everything.
363.952	The most powerful Democrat
363.952	in the country lost everything.
366.754	He lost his money, he lost his power.
368.574	What does he have to say
368.574	all these years later?
370.886	"""I am so much better off physically,"
370.886	financially, mentally
373.649	"and in almost every other way."""
375.474	What other way would there
375.474	be to be better off?
377.737	Vegetably? Minerally? Animally?
379.589	He's pretty much covered them there.
382.327	Moreese Bickham is somebody
382.327	you've never heard of.
384.832	Moreese Bickham uttered
384.832	these words upon being released.
387.536	He was 78 years old.
388.869	He'd spent 37 years
388.869	in a Louisiana State Penitentiary
391.816	for a crime he didn't commit.
393.324	[He was ultimately released
395.181	for good behavior
395.181	halfway through his sentence.]
397.474	What did he say about his experience?
399.474	"""I don't have one minute's regret."
399.474	"It was a glorious experience."" Glorious!"
403.056	He is not saying,
404.33	"""Well, there were some nice guys."
404.33	"They had a gym."""
406.75	"""Glorious,"""
407.925	a word we usually reserve for something
407.925	like a religious experience.
411.227	Harry S. Langerman uttered these words,
411.227	and he's somebody you might have known
414.98	but didn't, because in 1949
414.98	he read a little article in the paper
418.613	about a hamburger stand owned
418.613	by two brothers named McDonalds.
421.603	And he thought,
421.603	"""That's a really neat idea!"""
423.858	So he went to find them. They said,
425.565	"""We can give you a franchise"
425.565	"on this for 3,000 bucks."""
428.133	Harry went back to New York,
428.133	asked his brother, an investment banker,
431.397	to loan him the $3,000,
431.397	and his brother's immortal words were,
434.329	"""You idiot, nobody eats hamburgers."""
436.071	He wouldn't lend him the money,
437.584	and of course, six months later
437.584	Ray Kroc had exactly the same idea.
440.822	It turns out people do eat hamburgers,
443.04	and Ray Kroc, for a while,
443.04	became the richest man in America.
446.864	And then, finally,
448.046	some of you recognize
448.046	this young photo of Pete Best,
451.53	who was the original
451.53	drummer for the Beatles,
453.697	until they, you know, sent him
453.697	out on an errand and snuck away
457.546	and picked up Ringo on a tour.
459.53	Well, in 1994, when Pete Best
459.53	was interviewed --
461.85	yes, he's still a drummer;
461.85	yes, he's a studio musician --
464.91	"he had this to say: ""I'm happier"
464.91	"than I would have been with the Beatles."""
468.441	Okay. There's something important
468.441	to be learned from these people,
471.597	and it is the secret of happiness.
473.496	Here it is, finally to be revealed.
475.893	First: accrue wealth, power,
475.893	and prestige, then lose it.
479.139	(Laughter)
481.815	Second: spend as much of your life
481.815	in prison as you possibly can.
485.597	(Laughter)
486.622	Third: make somebody else
486.622	really, really rich.
489.876	And finally: never ever join the Beatles.
492.623	(Laughter)
493.671	Yeah, right.
494.846	Because when people synthesize happiness,
496.956	as these gentlemen seem to have done,
499.174	we all smile at them,
499.174	but we kind of roll our eyes and say,
502.977	"""Yeah right, you never"
502.977	"really wanted the job."""
505.537	"""Oh yeah, right. You really didn't have"
505.537	that much in common with her,
509.537	and you figured that out just
509.537	about the time
511.657	she threw the engagement
511.657	"ring in your face."""
513.777	We smirk because we believe
513.777	that synthetic happiness
517.537	is not of the same quality
517.537	"as what we might call ""natural happiness."""
521.037	What are these terms?
522.513	Natural happiness is what we get
522.513	when we get what we wanted,
525.941	and synthetic happiness is what we make
525.941	when we don't get what we wanted.
530.869	And in our society,
530.869	we have a strong belief
533.869	that synthetic happiness
533.869	is of an inferior kind.
536.869	Why do we have that belief?
538.9	Well, it's very simple.
540.598	What kind of economic engine
540.598	would keep churning
544.415	if we believed
544.415	that not getting what we want
547.375	could make us just as happy as getting it?
550.844	With all apologies
550.844	to my friend Matthieu Ricard,
553.971	a shopping mall full of Zen monks
556.197	is not going to be
556.197	particularly profitable,
558.335	because they don't want stuff enough.
560.961	(Laughter)
562.066	I want to suggest to you
562.066	that synthetic happiness
565.187	is every bit as real and enduring
567.416	as the kind of happiness you stumble upon
570.091	when you get exactly
570.091	what you were aiming for.
572.678	I'm a scientist, so I'm going
572.678	to do this not with rhetoric,
575.478	but by marinating you
575.478	in a little bit of data.
577.653	Let me first show you an experimental
577.653	paradigm that is used
580.623	to demonstrate the synthesis of happiness
580.623	among regular old folks.
584.829	And this isn't mine.
586.011	It's a 50-year-old paradigm
586.011	"called the ""free choice paradigm."""
589.011	It's very simple.
590.416	You bring in, say, six objects,
593.146	and you ask a subject to rank them
593.146	from the most to the least liked.
596.431	In this case, because
596.431	this experiment uses them,
599.013	these are Monet prints.
600.416	So, everybody can rank these Monet prints
602.416	from the one they like the most,
602.416	to the one they like the least.
605.441	Now we give you a choice:
607.155	"""We happen to have"
607.155	some extra prints in the closet.
609.581	We're going to give you
609.581	one as your prize to take home.
612.226	We happen to have number three
612.226	"and number four,"" we tell the subject."
616.082	This is a bit of a difficult choice,
618.004	because neither one is preferred
618.004	strongly to the other,
620.63	but naturally, people
620.63	tend to pick number three
623.274	because they liked it
623.274	a little better than number four.
626.764	Sometime later -- it could be
630.308	the same stimuli are put
630.308	before the subject,
632.416	and the subject is asked
632.416	to re-rank the stimuli.
635.145	"""Tell us how much you like them now."""
637.146	What happens?
638.377	Watch as happiness is synthesized.
640.37	This is the result that has
640.37	been replicated over and over again.
643.416	You're watching happiness be synthesized.
645.431	Would you like to see it again?
648.023	Happiness!
649.416	"""The one I got is really"
649.416	better than I thought!
651.679	"That other one I didn't get sucks!"""
653.416	That's the synthesis of happiness.
655.583	(Laughter)
656.644	Now, what's the right response to that?
659.717	"""Yeah, right!"""
662.334	Now, here's the experiment we did,
664.416	and I hope this is going to convince you
666.355	"that ""Yeah, right!"""
666.355	was not the right response.
668.656	We did this experiment
668.656	with a group of patients
670.902	who had anterograde amnesia.
672.323	These are hospitalized patients.
674.006	Most of them have Korsakoff's syndrome,
676.195	a polyneuritic psychosis.
678.955	They drank way too much,
678.955	and they can't make new memories.
682.416	OK? They remember their childhood,
682.416	but if you walk in and introduce yourself,
686.353	and then leave the room,
687.57	when you come back,
687.57	they don't know who you are.
690.979	We took our Monet prints to the hospital.
694.392	And we asked these patients to rank them
697.416	from the one they liked
697.416	the most to the one they liked the least.
700.536	We then gave them the choice
700.536	between number three and number four.
704.416	Like everybody else, they said,
706.416	"""Gee, thanks Doc! That's great!"
706.416	I could use a new print.
709.107	"I'll take number three."""
710.86	We explained we would have
710.86	number three mailed to them.
714.416	We gathered up our materials
714.416	and we went out of the room,
717.416	and counted to a half hour.
718.803	(Laughter)
719.828	Back into the room,
719.828	"we say, ""Hi, we're back."""
723.336	The patients, bless them,
723.336	"say, ""Ah, Doc, I'm sorry,"
726.416	I've got a memory problem;
726.416	that's why I'm here.
729.177	"If I've met you before, I don't remember."""
731.202	"""Really, you don't remember?"
731.202	"I was just here with the Monet prints?"""
734.418	"""Sorry, Doc, I just don't have a clue."""
737.036	"""No problem, Jim. All I want"
737.036	you to do is rank these for me
740.678	from the one you like the most
740.678	"to the one you like the least."""
744.798	What do they do?
745.973	Well, let's first check and make sure
745.973	they're really amnesiac.
748.903	We ask these amnesiac patients
748.903	to tell us which one they own,
752.917	which one they chose last
752.917	time, which one is theirs.
756.239	And what we find is amnesiac
756.239	patients just guess.
759.416	These are normal controls,
759.416	where if I did this with you,
762.076	all of you would know
762.076	which print you chose.
764.203	But if I do this with amnesiac patients,
764.203	they don't have a clue.
768.031	They can't pick
768.031	their print out of a lineup.
771.825	Here's what normal controls do:
771.825	they synthesize happiness.
775.416	Right? This is the change in liking score,
777.999	the change from the first time they ranked
777.999	to the second time they ranked.
781.53	Normal controls show --
781.53	that was the magic I showed you;
784.233	now I'm showing it to you
784.233	in graphical form --
786.416	"""The one I own is better than I thought."
788.577	The one I didn't own,
788.577	the one I left behind,
790.966	"is not as good as I thought."""
793.52	Amnesiacs do exactly the same thing.
793.52	Think about this result.
798.027	These people like better the one they own,
800.861	but they don't know they own it.
804.526	"""Yeah, right"" is not the right response!"
808.885	What these people did
808.885	when they synthesized happiness
812.091	is they really, truly changed
814.75	their affective, hedonic, aesthetic
814.75	reactions to that poster.
820.003	They're not just saying it
820.003	because they own it,
822.416	because they don't know they own it.
825.688	When psychologists show you bars,
828.339	you know that they are showing
828.339	you averages of lots of people.
831.918	And yet, all of us have this
831.918	psychological immune system,
835.251	this capacity to synthesize happiness,
837.749	but some of us do this trick
837.749	better than others.
840.924	And some situations allow anybody
840.924	to do it more effectively
844.981	than other situations do.
848.321	It turns out that freedom,
851.59	the ability to make up your mind
851.59	and change your mind,
854.94	is the friend of natural happiness,
854.94	because it allows you to choose
858.519	among all those delicious futures
860.719	and find the one
860.719	that you would most enjoy.
863.226	But freedom to choose,
865.002	to change and make up your mind,
866.783	is the enemy of synthetic happiness.
869.729	And I'm going to show you why.
869.729	Dilbert already knows, of course.
872.799	"""Dogbert's tech support."
872.799	"How may I abuse you?"""
875.005	"""My printer prints a blank"
875.005	"page after every document."""
877.643	"""Why complain about getting free paper?"""
879.643	"""Free? Aren't you just"
879.643	"giving me my own paper?"""
881.943	"""Look at the quality of the free paper"
881.943	compared to your lousy regular paper!
885.643	Only a fool or a liar would say
885.643	"that they look the same!"""
888.443	"""Now that you mention it,"
888.443	"it does seem a little silkier!"""
891.229	"""What are you doing?"""
892.429	"""I'm helping people accept the things"
892.429	"they cannot change."" Indeed."
896.775	The psychological immune system works best
899.125	when we are totally stuck,
899.125	when we are trapped.
902.344	This is the difference
902.344	between dating and marriage.
904.75	You go out on a date with a guy,
906.343	and he picks his nose;
906.343	you don't go out on another date.
909.003	You're married to a guy
909.003	and he picks his nose?
911.201	He has a heart of gold.
911.201	Don't touch the fruitcake!
913.707	You find a way to be happy
913.707	with what's happened.
917.444	(Laughter)
918.469	Now, what I want to show you
919.882	is that people don't know
919.882	this about themselves,
922.509	and not knowing this can work
922.509	to our supreme disadvantage.
926.811	Here's an experiment we did at Harvard.
928.812	We created a black-and-white
928.812	photography course,
931.864	and we allowed students to come in
931.864	and learn how to use a darkroom.
935.343	So we gave them cameras;
935.343	they went around campus;
937.701	they took 12 pictures
937.701	of their favorite professors
940.082	and their dorm room and their dog,
942.296	and all the other things they wanted
942.296	to have Harvard memories of.
945.438	They bring us the camera;
945.438	we make up a contact sheet;
947.988	they figure out which are
947.988	the two best pictures;
950.307	and we now spend six hours
950.307	teaching them about darkrooms.
953.013	And they blow two of them up,
954.478	and they have two gorgeous
954.478	eight-by-10 glossies
956.748	of meaningful things to them, and we say,
958.756	"""Which one would you like to give up?"""
960.62	"""I have to give one up?"""
961.795	"""Yes, we need one as evidence"
961.795	of the class project.
964.931	So you have to give me one.
964.931	You have to make a choice.
967.573	You get to keep one,
967.573	"and I get to keep one."""
970.343	Now, there are two conditions
970.343	in this experiment.
973.343	In one case, the students are told,
975.645	"""But you know,"
975.645	if you want to change your mind,
978.025	I'll always have the other one here,
979.902	and in the next four days, before
979.902	"I actually mail it to headquarters"" --"
984.289	"Yeah, ""headquarters"" --"
986.638	"""I'll be glad to swap it out with you."
989.343	In fact, I'll come to your dorm room,
989.343	just give me an email.
992.337	Better yet, I'll check with you.
994.352	You ever want to change your mind,
994.352	"it's totally returnable."""
997.264	The other half of the students
997.264	are told exactly the opposite:
1000.185	"""Make your choice, and by the way,"
1001.836	the mail is going out, gosh,
1001.836	in two minutes, to England.
1004.853	Your picture will be winging
1004.853	its way over the Atlantic.
1007.599	"You will never see it again."""
1009.789	Half of the students
1009.789	in each of these conditions
1012.067	are asked to make predictions
1013.503	about how much they're going to come
1013.503	to like the picture that they keep
1017.138	and the picture they leave behind.
1018.843	Other students are just sent back
1018.843	to their little dorm rooms
1021.774	and they are measured
1021.774	over the next three to six days
1024.909	on their liking, satisfaction
1024.909	with the pictures.
1027.208	And look at what we find.
1028.424	First of all, here's what students
1028.424	think is going to happen.
1031.572	They think they're going to maybe
1031.572	come to like the picture they chose
1035.396	a little more
1035.396	than the one they left behind,
1037.909	but these are not statistically
1037.909	significant differences.
1040.993	It's a very small increase,
1040.993	and it doesn't much matter
1044.681	whether they were in the reversible
1044.681	or irreversible condition.
1047.673	Wrong-o. Bad simulators. Because
1047.673	here's what's really happening.
1051.909	Both right before the swap
1051.909	and five days later,
1055.33	people who are stuck with that picture,
1057.54	who have no choice,
1058.716	who can never change their mind,
1060.78	like it a lot!
1062.934	And people who are deliberating
1062.934	"-- ""Should I return it?"
1065.909	Have I gotten the right one?
1065.909	Maybe this isn't the good one?
1069.148	"Maybe I left the good one?"" --"
1069.148	have killed themselves.
1071.764	They don't like their picture,
1073.225	and in fact even after the opportunity
1073.225	to swap has expired,
1076.082	they still don't like their picture.
1078.199	Why?
1079.373	Because the [reversible] condition
1079.373	is not conducive
1083.392	to the synthesis of happiness.
1085.164	So here's the final piece
1085.164	of this experiment.
1088.076	We bring in a whole new group
1088.076	of naive Harvard students
1091.909	"and we say, ""You know,"
1091.909	we're doing a photography course,
1095.289	and we can do it one of two ways.
1097.607	We could do it so that when
1097.607	you take the two pictures,
1100.162	you'd have four days to change your mind,
1102.185	or we're doing another course
1102.185	where you take the two pictures
1105.082	and you make up your mind right away
1105.082	and you can never change it.
1108.189	Which course would you like
1108.189	"to be in?"" Duh!"
1112.909	prefer to be in the course where they have
1112.909	the opportunity to change their mind.
1116.909	Hello? 66 percent of the students
1116.909	choose to be in the course
1120.909	in which they will ultimately be deeply
1120.909	dissatisfied with the picture.
1124.909	Because they do not know the conditions
1124.909	under which synthetic happiness grows.
1131.747	The Bard said everything best,
1131.747	of course, and he's making my point here
1136.861	but he's making it hyperbolically:
1138.909	"""'Tis nothing good or bad /"
1138.909	"But thinking makes it so."""
1141.909	It's nice poetry,
1141.909	but that can't exactly be right.
1145.372	Is there really nothing good or bad?
1147.909	Is it really the case that gall bladder
1147.909	surgery and a trip to Paris
1151.282	are just the same thing?
1152.917	(Laughter)
1154.028	That seems like a one-question IQ test.
1157.909	They can't be exactly the same.
1159.909	In more turgid prose,
1159.909	but closer to the truth,
1162.909	was the father of modern capitalism,
1162.909	Adam Smith, and he said this.
1166.307	This is worth contemplating:
1168.286	"""The great source of both the misery"
1168.286	and disorders of human life
1172.262	seems to arise from overrating
1172.262	the difference
1174.909	between one permanent
1174.909	situation and another --
1177.909	Some of these situations may, no doubt,
1177.909	deserve to be preferred to others,
1183.23	but none of them can deserve to be pursued
1186.183	with that passionate ardor
1186.183	which drives us to violate the rules
1190.651	either of prudence or of justice,
1193.27	or to corrupt the future
1193.27	tranquility of our minds,
1196.059	either by shame from the remembrance
1196.059	of our own folly,
1199.62	or by remorse for the horror
1199.62	"of our own injustice."""
1203.716	In other words: yes, some things
1203.716	are better than others.
1208.472	We should have preferences that lead us
1208.472	into one future over another.
1213.999	But when those preferences
1213.999	drive us too hard and too fast
1217.804	because we have overrated
1217.804	the difference between these futures,
1221.519	we are at risk.
1223.512	When our ambition is bounded,
1223.512	it leads us to work joyfully.
1227.821	When our ambition is unbounded,
1229.717	it leads us to lie, to cheat,
1229.717	to steal, to hurt others,
1234.155	to sacrifice things of real value.
1236.178	When our fears are bounded,
1238.219	we're prudent, we're cautious,
1240.378	we're thoughtful.
1241.613	When our fears
1241.613	are unbounded and overblown,
1244.872	we're reckless, and we're cowardly.
1247.625	The lesson I want to leave
1247.625	you with, from these data,
1250.999	is that our longings and our worries
1250.999	are both to some degree overblown,
1255.102	because we have within us the capacity
1255.102	to manufacture the very commodity
1261.298	we are constantly chasing
1261.298	when we choose experience.
1265.741	Thank you.
1266.916	(Applause)
