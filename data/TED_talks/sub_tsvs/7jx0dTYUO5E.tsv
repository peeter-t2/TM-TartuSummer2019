22.33	Alright.
23.676	I'm going to show you a couple of images
26.33	from a very diverting paper
26.33	in The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine.
33.33	I'm going to go way out on a limb and say
33.33	that it is the most diverting paper
37.03	ever published in
37.03	The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine.
39.73	"The title is ""Observations"
39.73	"of In-Utero Masturbation."""
44.33	(Laughter)
47.33	Okay. Now on the left you can see
47.33	the hand -- that's the big arrow --
51.63	and the penis on the right.
51.63	The hand hovering.
54.876	And over here we have,
56.86	in the words of radiologist
56.86	Israel Meisner,
59.33	"""The hand grasping the penis in a fashion"
59.33	"resembling masturbation movements."""
64.33	Bear in mind this was an ultrasound,
66.33	so it would have been moving images.
68.33	Orgasm is a reflex
68.33	of the autonomic nervous system.
71.33	Now, this is the part
71.33	of the nervous system
73.354	that deals with the things
73.354	that we don't consciously control,
76.33	like digestion, heart rate
76.33	and sexual arousal.
80.639	And the orgasm reflex can be triggered
80.639	by a surprisingly broad range of input.
86.81	Genital stimulation. Duh.
89.33	But also, Kinsey interviewed a woman
91.33	who could be brought to orgasm
91.33	by having someone stroke her eyebrow.
97.33	People with spinal cord injuries,
99.33	like paraplegias, quadriplegias,
101.33	will often develop a very,
101.33	very sensitive area
104.33	right above the level of their injury,
106.33	wherever that is.
108.33	There is such a thing
108.33	as a knee orgasm in the literature.
111.33	I think the most curious one
111.33	that I came across
115.33	was a case report of a woman
117.33	who had an orgasm every time
117.33	she brushed her teeth.
121.33	(Laughter)
124.33	Something in the complex
124.33	sensory-motor action of brushing her teeth
131.33	was triggering orgasm.
133.33	And she went to a neurologist,
133.33	who was fascinated.
136.33	He checked to see
136.33	if it was something in the toothpaste,
139.33	but no -- it happened with any brand.
142.33	They stimulated her gums with a toothpick,
142.33	to see if that was doing it.
146.497	No. It was the whole, you know, motion.
150.33	And the amazing thing to me
153.33	is that you would think this woman
153.33	would have excellent oral hygiene.
157.33	(Laughter)
161.33	Sadly -- this is what it said
161.33	in the journal paper --
164.069	"""She believed that she was"
164.069	possessed by demons
166.33	and switched to mouthwash
166.33	"for her oral care."""
169.33	It's so sad.
171.33	(Laughter)
172.431	When I was working on the book,
175.33	I interviewed a woman
175.33	who can think herself to orgasm.
179.33	She was part of a study
179.33	at Rutgers University.
182.33	You've got to love that. Rutgers.
184.33	So I interviewed her in Oakland,
184.33	in a sushi restaurant.
189.33	"And I said, ""So, could you"
189.33	"do it right here?"""
192.33	And she said,
193.53	"""Yeah, but you know I'd rather"
193.53	"finish my meal if you don't mind."""
196.669	(Laughter)
197.73	But afterwards, she was kind enough
197.73	to demonstrate on a bench outside.
201.33	It was remarkable.
201.33	It took about one minute.
203.45	And I said to her,
206.33	"""Are you just doing this all the time?"""
209.33	(Laughter)
210.431	"She said, ""No. Honestly, when I get home,"
210.431	"I'm usually too tired."""
215.33	(Laughter)
218.33	She said that the last time
218.33	she had done it
221.33	was on the Disneyland tram.
223.33	(Laughter)
225.33	The headquarters for orgasm,
225.33	along the spinal nerve,
228.33	is something called the sacral nerve root,
233.089	which is back here.
234.33	And if you trigger,
234.33	if you stimulate with an electrode,
237.33	the precise spot,
237.33	you will trigger an orgasm.
241.33	And it is a fact that you can trigger
241.33	spinal reflexes in dead people --
247.33	a certain kind of dead person,
247.33	a beating-heart cadaver.
250.33	Now this is somebody who is brain-dead,
252.33	legally dead, definitely checked out,
254.33	but is being kept alive on a respirator,
256.33	so that their organs will be oxygenated
256.33	for transplantation.
260.33	Now in one of these brain-dead people,
263.33	if you trigger the right spot,
265.33	you will see something every now and then.
268.33	There is a reflex called
268.33	the Lazarus reflex.
270.402	And this is -- I'll demonstrate
270.402	as best I can, not being dead.
276.33	It's like this. You trigger the spot.
278.33	The dead guy, or gal, goes... like that.
283.33	Very unsettling for people
283.33	working in pathology labs.
286.33	(Laughter)
287.431	Now, if you can trigger
287.431	the Lazarus reflex in a dead person,
292.33	why not the orgasm reflex?
295.615	I asked this question
295.615	to a brain death expert,
299.33	Stephanie Mann, who was foolish enough
299.33	to return my emails.
302.33	(Laughter)
303.431	"I said, ""So, could you conceivably"
303.431	"trigger an orgasm in a dead person?"""
308.33	"She said, ""Yes, if the sacral nerve"
308.33	is being oxygenated,
311.021	"you conceivably could."""
314.33	Obviously it wouldn't be
314.33	as much fun for the person.
318.33	But it would be an orgasm --
320.33	(Laughter)
321.431	nonetheless.
322.911	There is a researcher
322.911	at the University of Alabama
327.021	who does orgasm research.
328.33	I said to her,
328.33	"""You should do an experiment."
330.45	You know? You can get cadavers
330.45	"if you work at a university."""
333.33	"I said, ""You should actually do this."""
335.33	"She said, ""You get the human subjects"
335.33	"review board approval for this one."""
338.832	(Laughter)
340.719	According to 1930s marriage manual author,
343.33	Theodoor van De Velde,
345.33	a slight seminal odor can be detected
345.33	on the breath of a woman
349.33	within about an hour
349.33	after sexual intercourse.
353.647	Theodoor van De Velde was something
353.647	of a semen connoisseur.
357.33	(Laughter)
359.33	This is a guy writing a book,
359.33	"""Ideal Marriage,"" you know."
362.021	Very heavy hetero guy.
364.33	But he wrote in this book,
364.33	"""Ideal Marriage"" --"
366.497	he said that he could differentiate
366.497	between the semen of a young man,
370.33	which he said had a fresh,
370.33	exhilarating smell,
374.33	and the semen of mature men,
374.33	whose semen smelled, quote,
378.33	"""Remarkably like that of the flowers"
378.33	of the Spanish chestnut.
381.33	Sometimes quite freshly floral,
383.33	and then again sometimes
383.33	"extremely pungent."""
385.402	(Laughter)
390.33	Okay. In 1999, in the state of Israel,
390.33	a man began hiccupping.
395.33	And this was one of those cases
395.33	that went on and on.
398.33	He tried everything his friends suggested.
400.354	Nothing seemed to help.
402.33	Days went by.
403.776	At a certain point, the man,
403.776	still hiccupping, had sex with his wife.
408.33	And lo and behold, the hiccups went away.
410.33	He told his doctor,
410.33	who published a case report
414.33	in a Canadian medical journal
414.33	under the title,
417.33	"""Sexual Intercourse as a Potential"
417.33	"Treatment for Intractable Hiccups."""
422.33	I love this article because
422.33	at a certain point they suggested
425.33	that unattached hiccuppers
425.33	could try masturbation.
429.33	(Laughter)
430.431	I love that because there is like a whole
430.431	demographic: unattached hiccuppers.
434.33	(Laughter)
436.33	Married, single, unattached hiccupper.
442.33	In the 1900s, early 1900s,
445.33	a lot of gynecologists believed
445.33	that when a woman has an orgasm,
450.33	the contractions serve to suck
450.33	the semen up through the cervix
455.33	and sort of deliver it
455.33	really quickly to the egg,
457.64	thereby upping the odds of conception.
460.33	"It was called the ""upsuck"" theory."
462.33	(Laughter)
465.353	If you go all the way back to Hippocrates,
469.33	physicians believed that orgasm in women
472.33	was not just helpful
472.33	for conception, but necessary.
475.33	Doctors back then
475.33	were routinely telling men
479.33	the importance of pleasuring their wives.
483.33	Marriage-manual author and semen-sniffer
483.33	Theodoor van De Velde --
487.33	(Laughter)
488.431	has a line in his book.
491.33	I loved this guy.
492.418	I got a lot of mileage
492.418	out of Theodoor van De Velde.
495.33	He had this line in his book
497.33	that supposedly comes
497.33	from the Habsburg Monarchy,
500.33	where there was an empress Maria Theresa,
503.33	who was having trouble conceiving.
505.33	And apparently the royal
505.33	court physician said to her,
508.33	"""I am of the opinion that the vulva"
508.33	of your most sacred majesty
512.354	be titillated for some time
512.354	"prior to intercourse."""
515.33	(Laughter)
516.431	It's apparently, I don't know,
516.431	on the record somewhere.
520.33	Masters and Johnson:
522.192	now we're moving forward to the 1950s.
524.33	Masters and Johnson were upsuck skeptics,
527.33	which is also really fun to say.
530.33	They didn't buy it.
532.33	And they decided,
532.33	being Masters and Johnson,
534.43	that they would get to the bottom of it.
536.43	They brought women into the lab
536.43	-- I think it was five women --
539.43	and outfitted them with cervical caps
539.43	containing artificial semen.
545.33	And in the artificial semen
545.33	was a radio-opaque substance,
549.33	such that it would show up on an X-ray.
552.933	This is the 1950s.
554.33	Anyway, these women
554.33	sat in front of an X-ray device.
558.33	And they masturbated.
560.33	And Masters and Johnson looked to see
560.33	if the semen was being sucked up.
564.33	Did not find any evidence of upsuck.
566.33	You may be wondering,
566.33	"""How do you make artificial semen?"""
570.33	(Laughter)
575.33	I have an answer for you.
575.33	I have two answers.
577.45	You can use flour and water,
577.45	or cornstarch and water.
580.33	I actually found three
580.33	separate recipes in the literature.
584.33	(Laughter)
585.431	My favorite being the one that says --
587.33	you know, they have
587.33	the ingredients listed,
589.431	and then in a recipe
589.431	it will say, for example,
591.646	"""Yield: two dozen cupcakes."""
593.33	"This one said, ""Yield: one ejaculate."""
596.33	(Laughter)
599.33	There's another way that orgasm
599.33	might boost fertility.
601.878	This one involves men.
603.33	Sperm that sit around in the body
603.33	for a week or more
605.783	start to develop abnormalities
608.33	that make them less effective
608.33	at head-banging their way into the egg.
612.33	British sexologist Roy Levin
612.33	has speculated
615.794	that this is perhaps why men
617.353	evolved to be such enthusiastic
617.353	and frequent masturbators.
620.33	"He said, ""If I keep tossing myself off"
620.33	"I get fresh sperm being made."""
624.33	Which I thought
624.33	was an interesting idea, theory.
628.33	So now you have an evolutionary excuse.
630.33	(Laughter)
634.33	Okay.
637.33	(Laughter)
639.33	All righty. There is considerable evidence
639.33	for upsuck in the animal kingdom --
644.33	pigs, for instance.
646.33	In Denmark, the Danish National Committee
646.33	for Pig Production
650.33	found out that if you
650.33	sexually stimulate a sow
655.307	while you artificially inseminate her,
657.185	you will see a six-percent increase
657.185	in the farrowing rate,
660.03	which is the number of piglets produced.
662.33	So they came up with this five-point
662.33	stimulation plan for the sows.
667.33	There is posters they put in the barn,
667.33	and they have a DVD.
672.33	And I got a copy of this DVD.
674.33	(Laughter)
675.431	This is my unveiling,
675.431	because I am going to show you a clip.
679.33	(Laughter)
681.33	So, okay.
683.98	Now, here we go, la la la, off to work.
686.33	It all looks very innocent.
689.33	He's going to be doing things
689.33	with his hands
691.45	that the boar would use
691.45	his snout, lacking hands. Okay.
695.33	(Laughter)
698.33	This is it.
699.954	The boar has a very odd
699.954	courtship repertoire.
703.33	(Laughter)
707.33	This is to mimic the weight of the boar.
709.33	(Laughter)
712.33	You should know, the clitoris
712.33	of the pig is inside the vagina.
715.33	So this may be
715.33	sort of titillating for her.
717.629	Here we go.
718.692	(Laughter)
740.33	And the happy result.
742.33	(Applause)
744.33	I love this video.
746.33	There is a point in this video,
746.33	towards the beginning,
748.954	where they zoom in for a close up
748.954	of his hand with his wedding ring,
752.216	as if to say,
752.216	"""It's okay, it's just his job."
754.337	"He really does like women."""
755.73	(Laughter)
759.33	Okay. When I was in Denmark,
759.33	my host was named Anne Marie.
764.81	"And I said, ""So why don't you just"
764.81	stimulate the clitoris of the pig?
768.33	Why don't you have the farmers do that?
770.33	"That's not one of your five steps."""
772.33	I have to read you
772.33	what she said, because I love it.
775.377	"She said, ""It was a big hurdle"
776.83	just to get farmers to touch
776.83	underneath the vulva.
779.33	So we thought, let's not mention
779.33	"the clitoris right now."""
782.33	(Laughter)
787.33	Shy but ambitious pig farmers, however,
787.33	can purchase a -- this is true --
790.783	a sow vibrator,
792.33	that hangs on the sperm
792.33	feeder tube to vibrate.
794.693	Because, as I mentioned,
794.693	the clitoris is inside the vagina.
799.33	So possibly, you know,
799.33	a little more arousing than it looks.
802.33	And I also said to her,
804.33	"""Now, these sows. I mean,"
804.33	you may have noticed there.
806.831	The sow doesn't look to be
806.831	"in the throes of ecstasy."""
809.43	And she said, you can't make
809.43	that conclusion,
811.597	because animals don't register
811.597	pain or pleasure
815.541	on their faces in the same way that we do.
817.612	Pigs, for example, are more like dogs.
820.33	They use the upper half of the face;
820.33	the ears are very expressive.
823.45	So you're not really sure
823.45	what's going on with the pig.
826.33	Primates, on the other hand,
826.33	we use our mouths more.
830.818	This is the ejaculation face
830.818	of the stump-tailed macaque.
834.33	(Laughter)
836.33	And, interestingly, this has been
836.33	observed in female macaques,
840.33	but only when mounting another female.
844.33	(Laughter)
847.33	Masters and Johnson.
848.617	In the 1950s, they decided,
848.617	okay, we're going to figure out
851.828	the entire human sexual response cycle,
854.33	from arousal, all the way through orgasm,
854.33	in men and women --
857.33	everything that happens in the human body.
859.354	Okay, with women,
859.354	a lot of this is happening inside.
862.33	This did not stop Masters and Johnson.
864.33	They developed an artificial
864.33	coition machine.
869.33	This is basically
869.33	a penis camera on a motor.
872.33	There is a phallus,
874.33	clear acrylic phallus,
874.33	with a camera and a light source,
877.33	attached to a motor
877.33	that is kind of going like this.
880.33	And the woman would have sex with it.
883.33	That is what they would do.
883.33	Pretty amazing.
885.354	Sadly, this device has been dismantled.
887.33	This just kills me,
887.33	not because I wanted to use it --
889.878	I wanted to see it.
892.33	(Laughter)
895.33	One fine day,
898.33	Alfred Kinsey decided to calculate
902.236	the average distance
902.236	traveled by ejaculated semen.
906.831	This was not idle curiosity.
908.33	Doctor Kinsey had heard --
912.33	and there was a theory going around
912.33	at the time, this being the 1940s --
915.83	that the force with which
915.83	semen is thrown against the cervix
919.33	was a factor in fertility.
922.33	Kinsey thought it was bunk,
922.33	so he got to work.
925.33	He got together in his lab
	and a movie camera.
933.33	(Laughter)
935.33	And in fact, he found
935.33	that in three quarters of the men
940.33	the stuff just kind of slopped out.
942.33	It wasn't spurted or thrown
942.33	or ejected under great force.
946.33	However, the record holder
950.33	landed just shy of the eight-foot mark,
950.33	which is impressive.
953.212	(Laughter)
954.33	(Applause)
955.431	Yes. Exactly.
957.33	(Laughter)
958.431	Sadly, he's anonymous.
958.431	His name is not mentioned.
961.33	(Laughter)
964.298	In his write-up
964.298	of this experiment in his book,
967.593	Kinsey wrote,
970.33	"""Two sheets were laid down to protect"
970.33	"the oriental carpets."""
974.33	(Laughter)
976.33	Which is my second favorite line
976.33	in the entire oeuvre of Alfred Kinsey.
980.33	"My favorite being, ""Cheese crumbs"
980.33	spread before a pair of copulating rats
984.33	will distract the female,
984.33	"but not the male."""
987.695	(Laughter)
989.33	Thank you very much.
991.33	(Applause)
995.33	Thanks!
