13.62	I'm a journalist,
14.891	and I'm an immigrant.
16.854	And these two conditions define me.
20.108	I was born in Mexico,
21.55	but I've spent more than half my life
21.55	reporting in the United States,
25.3	a country which was itself
25.3	created by immigrants.
28.308	As a reporter
31.242	and as a foreigner,
32.968	I've learned that neutrality,
36.139	silence
37.844	and fear aren't the best options --
40.75	not in journalism, nor in life.
42.978	Neutrality
45.046	is often an excuse that we journalists use
48.276	to hide from our true responsibility.
51.609	What is that responsibility?
54.12	It is to question
56.052	and to challenge
57.589	those in positions of power.
58.97	That's what journalism is for.
60.453	That's the beauty of journalism:
62.252	to question and challenge the powerful.
65.401	Of course, we have the obligation
65.401	to report reality as it is,
68.862	not how we would like it to be.
70.624	In that sense, I agree
70.624	with the principle of objectivity:
74.104	if a house is blue, I say that it's blue.
76.586	If there are a million unemployed people,
76.586	I say there are a million.
79.838	But neutrality
81.142	won't necessarily lead me to the truth.
85.021	Even if I'm unequivocally scrupulous,
88.584	and I present both sides of a news item --
92.928	the Democratic and the Republican,
95.063	the liberal and the conservative,
96.724	the government's and the opposition's --
98.697	in the end, I have no guarantee,
101.18	nor are any of us guaranteed
101.18	that we'll know what's true
104.395	and what's not true.
105.827	Life is much more complicated,
107.752	and I believe journalism should reflect
107.752	that very complexity.
113.522	To be clear: I refuse
117.154	to be a tape recorder.
118.52	I didn't become a journalist
118.52	to be a tape recorder.
120.953	I know what you're going to say:
120.953	no one uses tape recorders nowadays.
124.285	(Laughter)
125.376	In that case, I refuse
125.376	to take out my cell phone
129.19	and hit the record button
131.643	and point it in front of me
131.643	as if I were at a concert,
134.297	like a fan at a concert.
136.346	That is not true journalism.
138.94	Contrary to what many people think,
141.344	journalists are making
141.344	value judgments all the time,
145.917	ethical and moral judgments.
147.79	And we're always making decisions
147.79	that are exceedingly personal
153.642	and extraordinarily subjective.
155.831	For example:
157.797	What happens if you're called
157.797	to cover a dictatorship,
160.4	like Augusto Pinochet's regime in Chile
162.489	or Fidel Castro's in Cuba?
165.333	Are you going to report only what
165.333	the general and commander want,
169.106	or will you confront them?
170.997	What happens if you find out
170.997	that in your country
174.919	or in the country next door,
176.761	students are disappearing
179.797	and hidden graves are appearing,
181.822	or that millions of dollars
181.822	are disappearing from the budget
184.814	and that ex-presidents are magically
184.814	now multimillionaires?
189.248	Will you report only the official version?
191.321	Or what happens
193.445	if you're assigned to cover
195.766	the presidential elections
195.766	of the primary superpower,
200.813	and one of the candidates makes
200.813	comments that are racist,
206.397	sexist
208.064	and xenophobic?
211.004	That happened to me.
213.098	And I want to tell you what I did,
214.998	but first, let me explain
214.998	where I'm coming from,
217.59	so you can understand my reaction.
222.51	I grew up in Mexico City,
222.51	the oldest of five brothers,
225.418	and our family simply couldn't afford
225.418	to pay for all of our college tuition.
230.114	So I studied in the morning,
230.114	and worked in the afternoon.
233.552	Eventually,
235.838	I got the job I had always wanted:
238.975	television reporter.
240.324	It was a big opportunity.
242.048	But as I was working on
242.048	my third story, I ended up
245.645	criticizing the president,
247.676	and questioning the lack
247.676	of democracy in Mexico.
251.154	In Mexico, from 1929 to 2000,
251.154	elections were always rigged;
256.049	the incumbent president
256.049	would hand-pick his successor.
260.217	That's not true democracy.
263.603	To me it seemed like a brilliant idea
263.603	to expose the president,
266.632	but to my boss --
267.883	(Laughter)
269.74	My boss didn't think
269.74	it was such a great idea.
271.97	At that time, the presidential office,
271.97	Los Pinos, had issued a direct censor
275.721	against the media.
277.219	My boss, who, aside from being in charge
277.219	of the show I worked for,
281.005	was also in charge of a soccer team.
284.884	I always suspected that he was more
284.884	interested in goals
287.716	than in the news.
289.118	He censored my report.
290.95	He asked me to change it, I said no,
293.095	so he put another journalist on the story
296.055	to write what I was supposed to say.
299.809	I did not want to be
299.809	a censored journalist.
303.398	I don't know where I found the strength,
305.677	but I wrote my letter of resignation.
307.972	And so at 24 years of age -- just 24 --
312.302	I made the most difficult and most
312.302	transcendental decision of my life.
315.698	Not only did I resign from television,
317.875	but I had also decided
317.875	to leave my country.
321.328	I sold my car, a beat-up
321.328	little red Volkswagen,
325.069	came up with some money
326.884	and said goodbye to my family,
328.682	to my friends,
329.905	to my streets,
331.285	to my favorite haunts -- to my tacos --
333.398	(Laughter)
334.699	and I bought a one-way ticket
336.92	to Los Angeles, California.
339.123	And so I became
341.052	one of the 250 million immigrants
341.052	that exist in the world.
345.902	Ask any immigrant
347.742	about the first day they arrived
347.742	in their new country,
350.312	and you'll find that they remember
350.312	absolutely everything,
353.063	like it was a movie with background music.
355.145	In my case, I arrived in Los Angeles,
355.145	the sun was setting,
359.161	and everything I owned --
360.926	a guitar, a suitcase and some documents --
363.558	I could carry all of it
365.959	with my two hands.
367.142	That feeling of absolute freedom,
370.108	I haven't experienced since.
371.913	And I survived with what little I had.
375.35	I obtained a student visa; I was studying.
379.976	I ate a lot of lettuce and bread,
379.976	because that's all I had.
382.955	Finally, in 1984,
386.008	I landed my first job as a TV reporter
386.008	in the United States.
390.255	And the first thing I noticed
390.255	was that in the US,
394.326	my colleagues criticized --
394.326	and mercilessly --
396.533	then president Ronald Reagan,
398.042	and absolutely nothing happened;
398.042	no one censored them.
400.954	And I thought:
402.666	I love this country.
404.188	(Laughter)
407.146	(Applause)
410.542	And that's how it's been
412.709	for more than 30 years:
415.181	reporting with total freedom,
417.135	and being treated as an equal
417.135	despite being an immigrant --
420.065	until, without warning,
421.739	I was assigned to cover the recent
421.739	US presidential election.
428.356	On June 16, 2015,
432.148	a candidate who would eventually become
432.148	the president of the United States
436.265	said that Mexican immigrants
440.268	were criminals,
443.096	drug traffickers
444.928	and rapists.
446.112	And I knew
448.125	that he was lying.
449.301	I knew he was wrong
449.301	for one very simple reason:
452.166	I'm a Mexican immigrant.
454.277	And we're not like that.
455.66	So I did what any other reporter
455.66	would have done:
459.933	I wrote him a letter by hand
462.993	requesting an interview,
464.788	and I sent it to his Tower in New York.
467.19	The next day
469.105	I was at work,
470.328	and I suddenly began to receive
470.328	hundreds of calls and texts
473.925	on my cell phone,
475.438	some more insulting than others.
477.004	I didn't know what was happening
477.004	until my friend came into my office
480.525	"and said, ""They published"
480.525	"your cell number online."""
485.428	They actually did that.
487.764	Here's the letter they sent
491.162	where they gave out my number.
493.8	Don't bother writing it down, OK?
493.8	I already changed it.
496.486	(Laughter)
498.022	But I learned two things.
499.654	The first one is that you should
499.654	never, never, ever
504.129	give your cell number to Donald Trump.
507.018	(Laughter)
509.846	(Applause)
513.246	The second lesson was that
513.246	I needed to stop being neutral
517.607	at that point.
518.792	From then on, my mission
518.792	as a journalist changed.
521.497	I would confront the candidate
524.143	and show that he was wrong,
525.816	that what he said about immigrants
525.816	in the US was not true.
529.19	Let me give you some figures.
530.632	Ninety-seven percent of all undocumented
530.632	people in the United States
534.826	are good people.
536.158	Less than three percent
536.158	have committed a serious crime,
539.035	"or ""felony,"" as they say in English."
540.791	In comparison, six percent of US citizens
540.791	have committed a serious crime.
545.385	The conclusion is that undocumented
545.385	immigrants behave much better
551.247	than US citizens.
552.784	Based on that data, I made a plan.
555.652	Eight weeks after they published
555.652	my cell number,
559.874	I obtained a press pass
559.874	for a press conference
562.613	for the candidate
562.613	gaining momentum in the polls.
566.062	I decided to confront him
568.361	in person.
570.34	But ...
572.192	things didn't turn out exactly
572.192	as I had planned; watch:
577.349	[Donald Trump Press Conference
577.349	Dubuque, Iowa]
582.709	(Video) Jorge Ramos: Mr. Trump,
582.709	I have a question about immigration.
585.933	Donald Trump: Who's next? Yes, please.
587.823	JR: Your immigration plan
587.823	is full of empty promises.
590.284	DT: Excuse me, you weren't called.
590.284	Sit down. Sit down!
592.841	JR: I'm a reporter; as an immigrant
592.841	and as a US citizen,
595.543	I have the right to ask a question.
597.242	DT: No you don't.
597.242	JR: I have the right to ask --
599.549	DT: Go back to Univision.
600.766	JR: This is the question:
601.986	You cannot deport 11 million people.
604.828	You cannot build a 1900-mile wall.
608.015	You cannot deny citizenship
608.015	to children in this country.
611.724	DT: Sit down.
611.724	JR: And with those ideas --
613.689	DT: You weren't called.
614.865	JR: I'm a reporter and I have --
614.865	Don't touch me, sir.
617.913	Guard 1: Please don't disrupt.
617.913	You're being disruptive.
620.535	JR: I have the right to ask a question.
620.535	G1: Yes, in order. In turn, sir.
624.117	Guard 2: Do you have
624.117	your media credential?
626.162	JR: I have the right --
627.339	G2: Where? Let me see.
627.339	JR: It's over there.
629.372	Man: Whoever's coming out, stay out.
631.126	G2: You've just got to wait your turn.
632.992	Man: You're very rude. It's not about you.
635.043	JR: It's not about you --
635.043	Man: Get out of my country!
637.595	Man: It's not about you.
638.788	JR: I'm a US citizen, too.
640.064	Man: Well ...whatever.
640.064	No, Univision. It's not about you.
642.765	JR: It's not about you.
642.765	It's about the United States.
648.095	(Applause)
659.181	(Applause ends)
662.771	Whenever I see that video,
664.63	the first thing I always
664.63	think is that hate
667.944	is contagious.
669.237	If you notice, after the candidate says,
669.237	"""Go back to Univision"" -- that's code;"
673.551	what he's telling me
673.551	"is, ""Get out of here."""
675.77	One member of his entourage,
675.77	as if he had been given permission, said,
679.631	"""Get out of my country,"""
682.05	not knowing that I'm also a US citizen.
686.903	After watching this video many times,
689.44	I also think that in order
689.44	to break free from neutrality --
692.458	and for it to be a true break --
694.031	one has to lose their fear,
696.227	"and then learn how to say, ""No;"
698.456	I'm not going to be quiet.
700.568	I'm not going to sit down.
702.899	"And I'm not going to leave."""
704.795	"The word ""no"" --"
706.304	(Applause)
710.933	"""no"" is the most powerful word"
710.933	that exists in any language,
714.829	and it always precedes
714.829	any important change in our lives.
718.125	And I think there's enormous dignity
720.342	and it generates a great deal of respect
722.296	to be able to step back
723.849	and to push back and say,
726.009	"""No."""
727.199	Elie Wiesel -- Holocaust survivor,
729.805	Nobel Peace Prize recipient
731.163	and who, unfortunately,
731.163	we lost very recently --
734.001	said some very wise words:
736.352	"""We must take a side."
738.776	Neutrality helps only the oppressor,
741.316	"never the victim."""
742.491	And he's completely right.
743.76	We journalists are obligated
743.76	to take sides in certain circumstances;
747.626	in cases of racism,
749.476	discrimination,
751.246	corruption,
752.641	lying to the public,
754.149	dictatorships and human rights,
756.085	we need to set aside
756.085	neutrality and indifference.
759.616	Spanish has a great word
762.14	to describe the stance
762.14	that journalists should take.
766.203	The word is 
766.203	"""contrapoder [anti-establishment]."""
768.465	Basically, we journalists
768.465	should be on the opposite side
772.386	from those in power.
774.002	But if you're in bed with politicians,
776.6	if you go to the baptism or wedding
776.6	of the governor's son
779.321	or if you want to be
779.321	the president's buddy,
781.394	how are you going to criticize them?
783.259	When I'm assigned to interview
783.259	a powerful or influential person,
786.572	I always keep two things in mind:
788.345	if I don't ask this difficult
788.345	and uncomfortable question,
791.113	no one else is going to;
793.718	and that I'm never going to see
793.718	this person again.
796.685	So I'm not looking to make
796.685	a good impression
800.772	or to forge a connection.
802.1	In the end, if I have to choose
802.1	between being the president's friend
805.367	or enemy,
806.549	I always prefer to be their enemy.
811.001	In closing:
813.16	I know this is a difficult time
813.16	to be an immigrant and a journalist,
818.078	but now more than ever,
819.98	we need journalists who are prepared,
823.165	at any given moment,
824.76	to set neutrality aside.
827.177	Personally, I feel like
827.177	I've been preparing for this moment
830.039	my whole life.
831.217	When they censored me when I was 24,
833.527	I learned that neutrality, fear
833.527	and silence often make you an accomplice
840.221	in crime, abuse
842.667	and injustice.
844.238	And being an accomplice to power
846.287	is never good journalism.
849.394	Now, at 59 years old,
852.088	I only hope to have a tiny bit
854.91	of the courage and mental
854.91	clarity I had at 24,
858.941	and that way, never again
861.285	remain quiet.
862.682	Thank you very much.
863.974	(Applause)
866.637	Thank you.
867.844	(Applause)
