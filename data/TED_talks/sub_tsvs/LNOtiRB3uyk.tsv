18.33	I'll just start talking
18.33	about the 17th century.
20.593	I hope nobody finds that offensive.
22.33	I -- you know, when I --
22.33	after I had invented PCR,
25.33	I kind of needed a change.
27.33	And I moved down to La Jolla
27.33	and learned how to surf.
30.33	And I started living down there
30.33	on the beach for a long time.
33.33	And when surfers are out waiting
35.33	for waves,
37.33	you probably wonder, if you've never
37.33	been out there, what are they doing?
39.33	You know, sometimes there's a 10-,
41.33	when you're waiting for a wave to come in.
43.354	They usually talk about the 17th century.
46.33	You know, they get a real
46.33	bad rap in the world.
49.33	People think they're sort of lowbrows.
53.33	One day, somebody suggested
53.33	I read this book.
55.497	It was called --
57.33	"it was called ""The Air Pump,"""
59.33	"or something like ""The"
59.33	"Leviathan and The Air Pump."""
61.783	It was a real weird book
61.783	about the 17th century.
64.33	And I realized, the roots
66.33	of the way I sort of thought
68.33	was just the only natural
68.33	way to think about things.
71.33	That -- you know, I was born
71.33	thinking about things that way,
74.33	and I had always
74.33	been like a little scientist guy.
76.33	And when I went to find out something,
78.33	I used scientific methods.
78.33	I wasn't real surprised,
80.33	you know, when they first told me how --
82.33	how you were supposed to do science,
84.33	because I'd already been doing it
84.33	for fun and whatever.
88.33	But it didn't -- it never occurred to me
91.33	that it had to be invented
93.33	and that it had been invented
95.33	only 350 years ago.
97.33	You know, it was --
99.33	like it happened in England,
99.33	and Germany, and Italy
102.33	sort of all at the same time.
104.33	And the story of that,
106.33	I thought, was really fascinating.
108.33	So I'm going to talk
108.33	a little bit about that,
110.497	and what exactly is it
110.497	that scientists are supposed to do.
113.33	And it's, it's a kind of --
115.33	You know, Charles I got beheaded
119.33	somewhere early in the 17th century.
121.33	And the English set up Cromwell
123.33	and a whole bunch
123.33	of Republicans or whatever,
125.497	and not the kind of Republicans we had.
128.33	They changed the government,
128.33	and it didn't work.
132.33	And
135.33	Charles II, the son,
139.33	was finally put back
139.33	on the throne of England.
141.545	He was really nervous,
141.545	because his dad had been,
144.33	you know, beheaded for being
144.33	the King of England
146.64	And he was nervous about the fact
149.33	that conversations that got going
151.33	in, like, bars and stuff
153.33	would turn to --
155.33	this is kind of -- it's hard to believe,
157.33	but people in the 17th century in England
159.33	were starting to talk about, you know,
161.33	philosophy and stuff in bars.
163.33	They didn't have TV screens,
165.33	and they didn't have
165.33	any football games to watch.
167.688	And they would get really pissy,
169.33	and all of a sudden people would spill
169.33	out into the street and fight
172.593	about issues like whether or not
174.33	it was okay if Robert Boyle
177.33	made a device called the vacuum pump.
179.33	Now, Boyle was a friend of Charles II.
182.33	He was a Christian guy
182.33	during the weekends,
185.33	but during the week he was a scientist.
188.33	(Laughter)
189.33	Which was -- back then it was
191.33	sort of, you know, well, you know --
194.33	if you made this thing --
194.33	he made this little device,
196.878	like kind of like a bicycle pump
199.33	in reverse that could suck
199.33	all the air out of --
202.33	you know what a bell jar is?
202.33	One of these things,
204.33	you pick it up, put it
204.33	down, and it's got a seal,
206.688	and you can see inside of it,
208.33	so you can see what's going
208.33	on inside this thing.
210.33	But what he was trying to do
210.33	was to pump all the air out of there,
213.33	and see what would happen inside there.
215.33	I mean, the first -- I think
215.33	one of the first experiments he did
219.33	was he put a bird in there.
221.33	And people in the 17th century,
224.33	they didn't really understand
224.33	the same way we do
227.33	about you know, this stuff is
229.33	a bunch of different kinds of molecules,
232.33	and we breathe it
232.33	in for a purpose and all that.
235.33	I mean, fish don't know much about water,
237.33	and people didn't know much about air.
240.33	But both started exploring it.
242.33	One thing, he put a bird in there,
242.33	and he pumped all the air out,
244.33	and the bird died. So he said, hmm...
246.33	He said -- he called
246.33	what he'd done as making --
249.33	they didn't call it
249.33	a vacuum pump at the time.
251.545	Now you call it a vacuum
251.545	pump; he called it a vacuum.
254.33	Right? And immediately,
257.33	he got into trouble with the local clergy
259.33	who said, you can't make a vacuum.
262.33	Ah, uh --
264.33	(Laughter)
267.33	Aristotle said that nature abhors one.
269.33	I think it was a poor
269.33	translation, probably,
271.45	but people relied
271.45	on authorities like that.
274.33	And you know, Boyle says, well, shit.
277.33	I make them all the time.
279.33	I mean, whatever
279.33	that is that kills the bird --
282.33	and I'm calling it a vacuum.
284.33	And the religious people said that
287.33	if God wanted you to make --
290.33	I mean, God is everywhere,
292.33	that was one of their rules,
292.33	is God is everywhere.
294.735	And a vacuum --
294.735	there's nothing in a vacuum,
296.855	so you've -- God couldn't be in there.
299.33	So therefore the church said that you
299.33	can't make a vacuum, you know.
302.593	And Boyle said, bullshit.
304.33	I mean, you want to call it Godless,
306.33	you know, you call it Godless.
308.33	But that's not my job. I'm not into that.
310.33	I do that on the weekend. And like --
313.33	what I'm trying to do
313.33	is figure out what happens
316.33	when you suck everything
316.33	out of a compartment.
319.33	And he did all these
319.33	cute little experiments.
321.497	Like he did one with --
321.497	he had a little wheel,
324.33	like a fan, that was
327.33	sort of loosely attached,
327.33	so it could spin by itself.
330.33	He had another fan opposed to it
332.33	that he had like a --
334.33	I mean, the way I would have done
334.33	this would be, like, a rubber band,
336.33	and, you know, around a tinker
336.33	toy kind of fan.
338.593	I know exactly how he did
338.593	it; I've seen the drawings.
342.33	It's two fans, one which he could
342.33	turn from outside
344.33	after he got the vacuum established,
346.33	and he discovered that if he pulled
346.33	all the air out of it,
349.33	the one fan would no longer
349.33	turn the other one, right?
352.33	Something was missing, you know.
352.33	I mean, these are --
355.33	it's kind of weird to think that someone
355.33	had to do an experiment to show that,
357.33	but that was what was going
357.33	on at the time.
362.306	And like, there was big arguments about it
364.33	in the -- you know, the gin houses
364.33	and in the coffee shops and stuff.
368.33	And Charles
370.33	started not liking that.
372.33	Charles II was kind of saying, you
372.33	know, you should keep that --
375.33	let's make a place where
375.33	you can do this stuff
378.33	where people don't get so -- you know,
380.33	we don't want the -- we don't want to get
380.33	the people mad at me again. And so --
383.33	because when they started
383.33	talking about religion
386.33	and science and stuff like that,
388.33	that's when it had sort of gotten
388.33	his father in trouble.
391.021	And so,
392.33	Charles said, I'm going
392.33	to put up the money
394.402	give you guys a building,
396.33	come here and you can
396.33	meet in the building,
398.402	but just don't talk
398.402	about religion in there.
400.522	And that was fine with Boyle.
402.33	He said, OK, we're going
402.33	to start having these meetings.
405.021	And anybody who wants to do science is --
407.33	this is about the time that Isaac
407.33	Newton was starting to whip out
409.33	a lot of really interesting things.
411.33	And there was all kind of people
411.33	that would come to the Royal Society,
414.688	they called it. You had to be
414.688	dressed up pretty well.
417.33	It wasn't like a TED conference.
419.33	That was the only criteria,
419.33	was that you be --
421.33	you looked like a gentleman,
421.33	and they'd let anybody could come.
424.354	You didn't have to be a member then.
426.33	And so, they would come
426.33	in and you would do --
428.545	Anybody that was going
428.545	to show an experiment,
431.33	which was kind of a new word at the time,
433.33	demonstrate some principle,
435.33	they had to do it on stage,
435.33	where everybody could see it.
438.33	So they were --
440.33	the really important part of this was,
442.33	you were not supposed to talk
444.33	about final causes, for instance.
447.33	And God was out of the picture.
449.33	The actual nature of reality
449.33	was not at issue.
453.33	You're not supposed to talk
453.33	about the absolute nature of anything.
456.497	You were not supposed
456.497	to talk about anything
458.617	that you couldn't demonstrate.
460.33	So if somebody could see it, you could
460.33	say, here's how the machine works,
463.831	here's what we do, and then
463.831	here's what happens.
467.33	And seeing what happens, it was OK
469.33	to generalize,
471.33	and say, I'm sure that this
471.33	will happen anytime
474.33	we make one of these things.
476.33	And so you can start making up some rules.
478.354	You say, anytime you have a vacuum state,
481.33	you will discover that one wheel
481.33	will not turn another one,
484.33	if the only connection between them
486.33	is whatever was there before the vacuum.
486.33	That kind of thing.
489.33	Candles can't burn in a vacuum,
491.33	therefore, probably
491.33	sparklers wouldn't either.
494.33	It's not clear; actually sparklers will,
496.33	but they didn't know that.
498.33	They didn't have sparklers. But, they --
500.33	(Laughter)
505.33	-- you can make up rules,
505.33	but they have to relate
508.33	only to the things
508.33	that you've been able to demonstrate.
510.33	And most the demonstrations
510.33	had to do with visuals.
513.33	Like if you do an experiment on stage,
515.33	and nobody can see it, they can just hear it,
515.33	they would probably think you were freaky.
518.33	I mean, reality is what you can see.
521.33	That wasn't an explicit
521.33	rule in the meeting,
525.33	but I'm sure that was part of it,
525.33	you know. If people hear voices,
527.33	and they can't see and associate
527.33	it with somebody,
530.33	that person's probably not there.
532.33	But the general idea
532.33	that you could only --
536.33	you could only really talk
536.33	about things in that place
538.878	that had some kind of experimental basis.
541.33	It didn't matter what Thomas Hobbes,
543.33	who was a local philosopher,
545.33	said about it, you know,
547.33	because you weren't going
547.33	to be talking final causes.
549.878	What's happening here,
551.33	in the middle of the 17th century,
553.33	was that what became my field --
555.33	science, experimental science --
557.33	was pulling itself away,
559.33	and it was in a physical way, because we're
559.33	going to do it in this room over here,
562.33	but it was also what -- it
562.33	was an amazing thing that happened.
564.33	Science had been all interlocked
566.33	with theology, and philosophy,
568.33	and -- and -- and mathematics,
571.33	which is really not science.
574.33	But experimental science had
574.33	been tied up with all those things.
577.402	And the mathematics part
580.33	and the experimental science part
582.33	was pulling away from philosophy.
584.33	And -- things --
586.33	we never looked back.
588.33	It's been so cool since then.
591.33	I mean, it just -- it just -- untangled
591.33	a thing that was really impeding
596.33	technology from being developed.
598.33	And, I mean, everybody in this room --
600.33	now, this is 350 short years ago.
602.33	Remember, that's a short time.
604.33	It was 300,000, probably, years ago
607.33	that most of us, the ancestors
607.33	of most of us in this room
610.33	came up out of Africa
610.33	and turned to the left.
613.33	You know, the ones that turned
613.33	to the right, there are some of those
615.33	in the Japanese translation.
617.33	But that happened very -- a long time ago
620.33	compared to
624.33	But in that 350 years,
626.33	the place has just undergone
626.33	a lot of changes.
629.33	In fact, everybody in this room probably,
631.33	especially if you picked up your bag --
634.33	some of you, I know, didn't
634.33	pick up your bags --
636.33	but if you picked up your bag,
636.33	everybody in this room
638.33	has got in their pocket,
638.33	or back in their room,
640.593	something
642.33	that 350 years ago,
644.33	kings would have gone to war to have.
647.33	I mean, if you can think how important --
649.33	If you have a GPS system
649.33	and there are no satellites,
651.33	it's not going to be much use.
651.33	But, like --
653.402	but, you know, if somebody
653.402	had a GPS system
655.474	in the 17th century
658.33	some king would have
658.33	gotten together an army
660.33	and gone to get it, you know.
660.33	If that person --
662.33	Audience: For the teddy bear?
662.33	The teddy bear?
664.497	Kary Mullis: They might have done
664.497	it for the teddy bear, yeah.
667.474	But -- all of us own stuff.
669.33	I mean, individuals own things
671.33	that kings would have
671.33	definitely gone to war to get.
673.831	And this is just 350 years.
675.33	Not a whole lot of people
675.33	doing this stuff.
677.402	You know, the important people --
679.33	you can almost read about their lives,
681.33	about all the really important
681.33	people that made advances, you know.
684.545	And, I mean --
686.33	this kind of stuff, you
686.33	know, all this stuff
689.33	came from that separation
691.33	of this little sort of thing that we do --
694.33	now I, when I was a boy
696.33	was born sort of with this idea
698.33	that if you want to know something --
700.33	you know, maybe it's because my old
700.33	man was gone a lot,
702.33	and my mother didn't
702.33	really know much science,
704.545	but I thought if you want
704.545	to know something about stuff,
707.33	you do it -- you make
707.33	an experiment, you know.
709.545	You get -- you get, like --
711.33	I just had a natural feeling for science
714.33	and setting up experiments. I thought
714.33	that was the way everybody had always thought.
716.33	I thought that anybody
716.33	with any brains will do it that way.
719.33	It isn't true. I mean,
719.33	there's a lot of people --
722.33	You know, I was one of those
722.33	scientists that was --
725.33	got into trouble the other night at dinner
727.354	because of the post-modernism thing.
729.33	And I didn't mean, you know
729.33	-- where is that lady?
731.33	Audience: Here.
732.33	(Laughter)
733.33	KM: I mean, I didn't really
733.33	think of that as an argument
736.021	so much as just a lively discussion.
738.33	I didn't take it personally, but --
741.33	I just -- I had -- I naively had thought,
744.33	until this surfing experience
744.33	started me into the 17th century,
747.354	I'd thought that's just
747.354	the way people thought,
749.617	and everybody did,
749.617	and they recognized reality
752.33	by what they could see
752.33	or touch or feel or hear.
755.33	At any rate, when I was a boy,
760.33	I, like, for instance, I had this --
762.33	I got this little book
762.33	from Fort Sill, Oklahoma --
764.33	This is about the time
764.33	that George Dyson's dad
766.545	was starting to blow nuclear --
768.33	thinking about blowing
768.33	up nuclear rockets and stuff.
771.33	I was thinking about making
771.33	my own little rockets.
774.33	And I knew that frogs -- little frogs --
777.33	had aspirations of space travel,
779.33	just like people. And I --
781.33	(Laughter)
784.33	I was looking for a --
786.33	a propulsion system
788.33	that would like, make a rocket, like,
790.33	maybe about four feet high
790.33	go up a couple of miles.
792.783	And, I mean, that was my sort of goal.
795.33	I wanted it to go out of sight and then
795.33	I wanted this little parachute
798.688	to come back with the frog in it.
801.33	And -- I -- I --
803.33	I got this book from Fort Sill, Oklahoma,
805.33	where there's a missile base.
807.33	They send it out for amateur rocketeers,
810.33	and
812.33	it said in there
814.33	do not ever heat a mixture
814.33	of potassium perchlorate and sugar.
817.33	(Laughter)
820.33	You know,
822.33	that's what you call a lead.
824.33	(Laughter)
826.33	You sort of -- now you say,
826.33	well, let's see if I can
828.33	get hold of some potassium chlorate
828.33	and sugar, perchlorate and sugar,
831.33	and heat it; it would be interesting to see
831.33	what it is they don't want me to do,
834.33	and what it is going to --
834.33	and how is it going to work.
836.926	And we didn't have --
838.33	like, my mother
840.33	presided over the back yard
843.33	from an upstairs window,
845.33	where she would be ironing
845.33	or something like that.
847.33	And she was usually just
847.33	sort of keeping an eye on,
849.33	and if there was any puffs
849.33	of smoke out there,
851.545	she'd lean out and admonish us all
853.33	not to blow our eyes out. That was her --
858.33	You know, that was kind of the worst
858.33	thing that could happen to us.
860.33	That's why I thought, as long
860.33	as I don't blow my eyes out...
862.33	I may not care about the fact
865.33	that it's prohibited
865.33	from heating this solution.
867.33	I'm going to do it
867.33	carefully, but I'll do it.
869.497	It's like anything else that's prohibited:
871.521	you do it behind the garage.
873.33	(Laughter)
875.33	So, I went to the drug store
877.33	and I tried to buy
877.33	some potassium perchlorate
880.33	and it wasn't unreasonable then for a kid
882.33	to walk into a drug store
882.33	and buy chemicals.
885.33	Nowadays, it's no ma'am,
887.33	check your shoes. And like --
889.33	(Laughter)
891.33	But then it wasn't -- they didn't
891.33	have any, but the guy had --
893.33	I said, what kind of salts
893.33	of potassium do you have? You know.
896.33	And he had potassium nitrate.
898.33	And I said, that might do
898.33	the same thing, whatever it is.
901.33	I'm sure it's got to do with rockets
901.33	or it wouldn't be in that manual.
904.33	And so I -- I did some experiments.
906.33	You know, I started
906.33	off with little tiny amounts
908.64	of potassium nitrate and sugar,
910.33	which was readily available,
912.33	and I mixed it in different proportions,
914.33	and I tried to light it on fire.
917.33	Just to see what would happen,
917.33	if you mixed it together.
920.021	And it -- they burned.
921.33	It burned kind of slow,
921.33	but it made a nice smell,
923.33	compared to other rocket
923.33	fuels I had tried,
925.402	that all had sulfur in them.
927.33	And, it smelt like burnt candy.
930.33	And then I tried the melting
930.33	business, and I melted it.
933.33	And then it melted into a little sort
933.33	of syrupy liquid, brown.
937.33	And then it cooled
937.33	down to a brick-hard substance,
940.33	that when you lit that,
942.33	it went off like a bat.
944.33	I mean, the little bowl of that stuff
944.33	that had cooled down --
946.33	you'd light it, and it would just
946.33	start dancing around the yard.
948.33	And I said, there
950.33	is a way to get a frog
950.33	up to where he wants to go.
953.33	(Laughter)
954.33	So I started developing --
957.33	you know, George's dad had a lot of help.
957.33	I just had my brother.
960.33	But I -- it took me
960.33	about -- it took me about,
963.33	I'd say, six months
965.33	to finally figure
965.33	out all the little things.
967.402	There's a lot of little things involved
969.33	in making a rocket that it
969.33	will actually work,
971.545	even after you have the fuel.
973.33	But you do it, by -- what I just--
975.33	you know, you do experiments,
977.33	and you write down things sometimes,
978.33	you make observations, you know.
980.33	And then you slowly build up a theory
982.33	of how this stuff works.
984.33	And it was --
984.33	I was following all the rules.
986.45	I didn't know what the rules were,
988.33	I'm a natural born scientist, I guess,
990.33	or some kind of a throwback
990.33	to the 17th century, whatever.
993.33	But at any rate, we finally did
997.33	have a device that would reproduceably
999.33	put a frog out of sight
1001.33	and get him back alive.
1003.33	And we had not --
1005.33	I mean, we weren't frightened by it.
1008.33	We should have been,
1008.33	because it made a lot of smoke
1010.783	and it made a lot of noise,
1012.33	and it was powerful, you know.
1014.33	And once in a while, they would blow up.
1016.33	But I wasn't worried, by the way,
1018.33	about, you know,
1020.33	the explosion causing
1020.33	the destruction of the planet.
1022.33	I hadn't heard about the 10 ways
1024.33	that we should be afraid of the --
1026.33	By the way,
1028.33	I could have thought,
1030.33	I'd better not do this because
1032.33	they say not to, you know.
1034.33	And I'd better get permission
1034.33	from the government.
1036.33	If I'd have waited around for that,
1038.33	I would have never -- the frog
1038.33	would have died, you know.
1042.33	At any rate, I bring it
1042.33	up because it's a good story,
1045.33	and he said, tell personal things,
1045.33	you know, and that's a personal --
1047.33	I was going to tell you about the first
1047.33	night that I met my wife,
1050.33	but that would be too
1050.33	personal, wouldn't it.
1053.33	So, so I've got something
1053.33	else that's not personal.
1055.783	But that... process
1055.783	is what I think of as science,
1058.33	see, where you start with some idea,
1061.33	and then instead of, like, looking up,
1064.33	every authority that you've ever heard of
1066.33	I -- sometimes you do that,
1068.33	if you're going to write a paper later,
1070.33	you want to figure
1070.33	out who else has worked on it.
1072.33	But in the actual process,
1072.33	you get an idea --
1074.497	like, when I got the idea one night
1076.33	that I could amplify DNA
1076.33	with two oligonucleotides,
1079.33	and I could make lots of copies
1079.33	of some little piece of DNA,
1082.33	you know, the thinking for that
1084.33	was about 20 minutes
1084.33	while I was driving my car,
1088.33	and then instead of going -- I went
1088.33	back and I did talk to people about it,
1091.926	but if I'd listened to what I heard
1091.926	from all my friends who were molecular biologists --
1096.33	I would have abandoned it.
1098.33	You know, if I had gone back
1098.33	looking for an authority figure
1100.33	who could tell me if it would work or not,
1102.354	he would have said, no, it probably won't.
1104.378	Because the results of it
1104.378	were so spectacular
1108.33	that if it worked it was going to change
1108.33	everybody's goddamn way of doing molecular biology.
1111.33	Nobody wants a chemist to come in
1113.33	and poke around in their stuff
1113.33	like that and change things.
1116.33	But if you go to authority,
1116.33	and you always don't --
1118.33	you don't always get
1118.33	the right answer, see.
1120.402	But I knew, you'd go into the lab
1122.33	and you'd try to make it work yourself.
1122.33	And then you're the authority,
1124.33	and you can say, I know it works,
1126.33	because right there in that tube
1128.33	is where it happened,
1130.33	and here, on this gel,
1130.33	there's a little band there
1132.33	that I know that's DNA,
1132.33	and that's the DNA I wanted to amplify,
1135.354	so there! So it does work.
1137.33	You know, that's how you do science.
1139.33	And then you say, well,
1139.33	what can make it work better?
1141.33	And then you figure out better
1141.33	and better ways to do it.
1143.33	But you always work from, from like, facts
1145.354	that you have made available to you
1148.33	by doing experiments: things
1148.33	that you could do on a stage.
1150.33	And no tricky shit behind the thing.
1150.33	I mean, it's all --
1153.33	you've got to be very honest
1155.33	with what you're doing if it
1155.33	really is going to work.
1157.33	I mean, you can't make up results,
1159.33	and then do another experiment
1159.33	based on that one.
1161.688	So you have to be honest.
1163.33	And I'm basically honest.
1165.33	I have a fairly bad memory, and dishonesty
1165.33	would always get me in trouble,
1168.33	if I, like -- so I've just
1168.33	sort of been naturally honest
1171.021	and naturally inquisitive,
1173.33	and that sort of leads
1173.33	to that kind of science.
1175.593	Now, let's see...
1177.33	I've got another five minutes, right?
1180.33	OK. All scientists aren't like that.
1184.33	You know -- and there is a lot --
1186.33	(Laughter)
1188.33	There is a lot -- a lot
1188.33	has been going on since
1190.593	Isaac Newton and all that stuff happened.
1193.33	One of the things that happened
1193.33	right around World War II
1195.33	in that same time period before,
1197.33	and as sure as hell afterwards,
1199.33	government got -- realized
1199.33	that scientists aren't strange dudes
1202.354	that, you know, hide in ivory towers
1205.33	and do ridiculous things with test tube.
1208.33	Scientists, you know, made World War II
1210.33	as we know it quite possible.
1212.33	They made faster things.
1215.33	They made bigger guns
1215.33	to shoot them down with.
1218.33	You know, they made drugs
1218.33	to give the pilots
1221.33	if they were broken up in the process.
1224.33	They made all kinds of --
1224.33	and then finally one giant bomb
1227.33	to end the whole thing, right?
1229.33	And everybody stepped back
1229.33	a little and said, you know,
1231.33	we ought to invest in this shit,
1233.33	because whoever has got
1233.33	the most of these people
1236.33	working in the places is going
1236.33	to have a dominant position,
1239.33	at least in the military, and probably
1239.33	in all kind of economic ways.
1242.33	And they got involved
1242.33	in it, and the scientific
1244.33	and industrial establishment was born,
1246.33	and out of that came a lot of scientists
1248.33	who were in there for the money, you know,
1251.33	because it was suddenly available.
1253.33	And they weren't the curious little boys
1255.33	that liked to put frogs up in the air.
1257.33	They were the same people that later
1257.33	went in to medical school, you know,
1260.33	because there was money in it, you know. I mean,
1260.33	later, then they all got into business --
1263.33	I mean, there are waves of --
1263.33	going into your high school,
1266.33	person saying, you want to be rich, you know,
1266.33	be a scientist. You know, not anymore.
1269.33	You want to be rich, you be a businessman.
1271.354	But a lot of people got in it for the money
1271.354	and the power and the travel.
1274.855	That's back when travel was easy.
1278.33	And those people don't think --
1280.33	they don't --
1282.33	they don't always tell
1282.33	you the truth, you know.
1284.33	There is nothing
1284.33	in their contract, in fact,
1286.45	that makes it to their advantage always,
1288.45	to tell you the truth.
1290.33	And the people I'm talking
1290.33	about are people that like --
1293.33	they say that they're
1293.33	a member of the committee
1296.33	called, say, the Inter-Governmental
1296.33	Panel on Climate Change.
1300.33	And they -- and they have these big
1300.33	meetings where they try to figure out
1304.33	how we're going to -- how we're
1304.33	going to continually prove
1307.116	that the planet is getting warmer,
1309.33	when that's actually contrary
1309.33	to most people's sensations.
1312.33	I mean, if you actually measure
1314.33	the temperature over a period --
1316.33	I mean, the temperature
1316.33	has been measured now
1318.497	pretty carefully for about 50, 60 years --
1321.33	longer than that it's been measured,
1323.33	but in really nice, precise ways,
1325.33	and records have been kept
1325.33	for 50 or 60 years,
1328.33	and in fact, the temperature
1328.33	hadn't really gone up.
1330.33	It's like, the average temperature
1332.33	has gone up a tiny little bit,
1334.33	because the nighttime temperatures
1337.33	at the weather stations have
1337.33	come up just a little bit.
1339.33	But there's a good explanation for that.
1341.33	And it's that the weather stations
1341.33	are all built outside of town,
1344.45	where the airport was, and now
1346.33	the town's moved out there,
1346.33	there's concrete all around
1348.33	and they call it the skyline effect.
1350.33	And most responsible people
1352.33	that measure temperatures realize
1354.33	you have to shield
1354.33	your measuring device from that.
1356.783	And even then, you know,
1359.33	because the buildings get
1359.33	warm in the daytime,
1360.33	and they keep it a little warmer at night.
1362.354	So the temperature has
1362.354	been, sort of, inching up.
1364.354	It should have been. But not a lot.
1364.354	Not like, you know --
1367.33	the first guy -- the first
1367.33	guy that got the idea
1369.33	that we're going to fry ourselves here,
1371.33	actually, he didn't think of it that way.
1373.33	His name was Sven Arrhenius.
1373.33	He was Swedish, and he said,
1376.33	if you double the CO2
1376.33	level in the atmosphere,
1379.33	which he thought might
1379.33	-- this is in 1900 --
1382.33	the temperature ought to go
1382.33	up about 5.5 degrees, he calculated.
1385.402	He was thinking of the earth
1385.402	as, kind of like,
1387.617	you know, like a completely
1387.617	insulated thing
1390.33	with no stuff in it, really,
1392.33	just energy coming down, energy leaving.
1394.33	And so he came up with this theory,
1396.33	and he said, this will be cool,
1398.33	because it'll be a longer
1398.33	growing season in Sweden,
1401.33	you know, and the surfers liked it,
1403.33	the surfers thought, that's a cool idea,
1405.33	because it's pretty cold
1405.33	in the ocean sometimes, and --
1408.33	but a lot of other people later on
1410.33	started thinking it
1410.33	would be bad, you know.
1413.33	But nobody actually
1413.33	demonstrated it, right?
1415.402	I mean, the temperature as measured --
1417.33	and you can find this
1417.33	on our wonderful Internet,
1419.64	you just go and look
1419.64	for all NASAs records,
1422.33	and all the Weather Bureau's records,
1424.33	and you'll look at it yourself,
1424.33	and you'll see, the temperature has just --
1427.33	the nighttime temperature measured
1427.33	on the surface of the planet
1430.354	has gone up a tiny little bit.
1432.33	So if you just average that and the daytime
1432.33	temperature, it looks like it went up
1434.33	about .7 degrees in this century.
1437.33	But in fact, it was just coming up --
1439.33	it was the nighttime; the daytime
1439.33	temperatures didn't go up.
1442.212	So -- and Arrhenius' theory --
1444.33	and all the global warmers think --
1446.33	they would say, yeah, it should
1446.33	go up in the daytime, too,
1448.33	if it's the greenhouse effect.
1450.33	Now, people like things
1450.33	that have, like, names like that,
1453.33	that they can envision it, right?
1453.33	I mean --
1456.33	but people don't like things
1456.33	like this, so -- most -- I mean,
1459.259	you don't get all excited about things
1461.33	like the actual evidence, you know,
1463.33	which would be evidence for strengthening
1465.33	of the tropical circulation in the 1990s.
1468.33	It's a paper that came out in February,
1470.33	and most of you probably
1470.33	hadn't heard about it.
1473.33	"""Evidence for Large Decadal Variability"
1475.33	in the Tropical Mean
1475.33	"Radiative Energy Budget."""
1479.33	Excuse me. Those papers
1479.33	were published by NASA,
1482.33	and some scientists
1482.33	at Columbia, and Viliki
1484.402	and a whole bunch of people, Princeton.
1487.33	And those two papers came
1487.33	out in Science Magazine,
1490.33	February the first,
1492.33	and these -- the conclusion
1492.33	in both of these papers,
1495.33	and in also the Science editor's, like,
1498.33	descriptions of these
1498.33	papers, for, you know,
1500.45	for the quickie,
1502.33	is that our theories about global warming
1504.33	are completely wrong. I mean,
1506.33	what these guys were doing,
1508.33	and this is what -- the NASA people
1508.33	have been saying this for a long time.
1511.33	They say, if you measure the temperature
1511.33	of the atmosphere, it isn't going up --
1514.33	it's not going up at all. We've doing
1514.33	it very carefully now for 20 years,
1517.831	from satellites, and it isn't going up.
1520.33	And in this paper, they show
1520.33	something much more striking,
1523.33	and that was that they did
1523.33	what they call a radiation --
1526.33	and I'm not going to go into the details
1526.33	of it, actually it's quite complicated,
1529.33	but it isn't as complicated
1529.33	as they might make you think it is
1532.33	by the words they use in those papers.
1532.33	If you really get down to it, they say,
1535.33	the sun puts out a certain
1535.33	amount of energy --
1537.545	we know how much that is --
1539.33	it falls on the earth, the earth
1539.33	gives back a certain amount.
1542.259	When it gets warm it generates --
1544.33	it makes redder energy --
1544.33	I mean, like infra-red,
1547.33	like something that's warm
1547.33	gives off infra-red.
1550.33	The whole business
1550.33	of the global warming --
1552.402	trash, really,
1554.33	is that -- if the -- if there's too
1554.33	much CO2 in the atmosphere,
1557.354	the heat that's trying to escape
1559.33	won't be able to get out. But
1559.33	the heat coming from the sun,
1562.33	which is mostly down in the --
1562.33	it's like 350 nanometers,
1565.33	which is where it's centered --
1565.33	that goes right through CO2.
1568.33	So you still get heated,
1568.33	but you don't dissipate any.
1570.33	Well, these guys measured
1570.33	all of those things.
1572.33	I mean, you can talk about that stuff,
1574.33	and you can write these large reports,
1574.33	and you can get government money to do it,
1578.212	but these -- they actually measured it,
1580.33	and it turns
1580.33	out that in the last 10 years --
1582.497	"that's why they say ""decadal"" there --"
1584.497	that the energy -- that the level
1587.33	"of what they call ""imbalance"""
1589.33	has been way the hell
1589.33	over what was expected.
1592.33	Like, the amount of imbalance --
1595.33	meaning, heat's coming
1595.33	in and it's not going out
1598.33	that you would get
1598.33	from having double the CO2,
1600.545	which we're not anywhere
1600.545	near that, by the way.
1603.33	But if we did, in 2025 or something,
1605.33	have double the CO2 as we had in 1900,
1608.33	they say it would be
1608.33	increase the energy budget
1610.593	by about -- in other words,
1613.33	one watt per square centimeter more
1615.33	would be coming in than going out.
1617.33	So the planet should get warmer.
1620.33	Well, they found out in this
1620.33	study -- these two studies
1622.974	by two different teams --
1624.33	that five and a half watts
1626.33	per square meter
1628.33	had been coming in from 1998, 1999,
1631.33	and the place didn't get warmer.
1633.33	So the theory's kaput -- it's nothing.
1635.33	These papers should have been called,
1637.33	"""The End to the Global"
1637.33	"Warming Fiasco,"" you know."
1640.33	They're concerned,
1642.33	and you can tell they have very
1642.33	guarded conclusions in these papers,
1645.33	because they're talking
1645.33	about big laboratories
1647.545	that are funded by lots of money
1649.33	and by scared people.
1651.33	You know, if they said, you know what?
1653.33	There isn't a problem
1653.33	with global warming any longer,
1655.33	so we can -- you know, they're funding.
1657.33	And if you start a grant request
1657.33	with something like that,
1660.33	and say, global warming
1660.33	obviously hadn't happened...
1662.783	if they -- if they -- if they actually
1662.783	-- if they actually said that,
1664.783	I'm getting out.
1666.33	(Laughter)
1669.33	I'll stand up too, and --
1671.33	(Laughter)
1673.33	(Applause)
1676.33	They have to say that.
1678.33	They had to be very cautious.
1680.33	But what I'm saying is,
1680.33	you can be delighted,
1682.497	because the editor
1682.497	of Science, who is no dummy,
1685.33	and both of these fairly professional --
1688.33	really professional teams, have
1688.33	really come to the same conclusion
1691.33	and in the bottom lines in their papers
1693.33	they have to say, what this means
1693.33	is, that what we've been thinking,
1696.33	was the global circulation
1696.33	model that we predict
1698.593	that the earth is going to get overheated
1700.593	that it's all wrong.
1700.593	It's wrong by a large factor.
1703.33	It's not by a small one. They just --
1706.33	they just misinterpreted
1706.33	the fact that the earth --
1709.33	there's obviously some mechanisms going on
1711.354	that nobody knew about,
1713.33	because the heat's coming
1713.33	in and it isn't getting warmer.
1715.33	So the planet is a pretty
1715.33	amazing thing, you know,
1718.33	it's big and horrible --
1718.33	and big and wonderful,
1720.33	and it does all kinds of things
1720.33	we don't know anything about.
1723.33	So I mean, the reason I put
1723.33	those things all together,
1725.33	OK, here's the way you're
1725.33	supposed to do science --
1727.33	some science is done for other
1727.33	reasons, and just curiosity.
1730.33	And there's a lot of things
1730.33	like global warming,
1732.64	and ozone hole and you know,
1734.33	a whole bunch of scientific public issues,
1736.354	that if you're interested in them,
1738.33	then you have to get down the details,
1738.33	and read the papers called,
1741.45	"""Large Decadal Variability in the..."""
1743.33	You have to figure
1743.33	out what all those words mean.
1745.64	And if you just listen to the guys
1747.33	who are hyping those issues,
1747.33	and making a lot of money out of it,
1750.33	you'll be misinformed, and you'll be
1750.33	worrying about the wrong things.
1753.64	Remember the 10 things that are going
1753.64	to get you. The -- one of them --
1757.045	(Laughter)
1758.33	And the asteroids is the one I really
1758.33	agree with there.
1761.33	I mean, you've got to watch out for asteroids.
1761.33	OK, thank you for having me here.
1765.164	(Applause)
