15.62	In half a century of trying to help prevent wars,
19.754	there's one question that never leaves me:
23.285	How do we deal with extreme violence
26.985	without using force in return?
30.486	When you're faced with brutality,
33.037	whether it's a child facing a bully on a playground
35.953	or domestic violence --
37.653	or, on the streets of Syria today,
40.569	facing tanks and shrapnel,
43.12	what's the most effective thing to do?
46.467	Fight back? Give in?
49.065	Use more force?
52.436	"This question: ""How do I deal with a bully"
56.398	"without becoming a thug in return?"""
60.148	has been with me ever since I was a child.
63.164	I remember I was about 13,
65.715	glued to a grainy black and white television in my parents' living room
70.701	as Soviet tanks rolled into Budapest,
74.966	and kids not much older than me
77.765	were throwing themselves at the tanks
80.266	and getting mown down.
82.434	And I rushed upstairs and started packing my suitcase.
86.235	"And my mother came up and said, ""What on Earth are you doing?"""
88.949	"And I said, ""I'm going to Budapest."""
91.231	"And she said, ""What on Earth for?"""
93.865	"And I said, ""Kids are getting killed there."
95.914	"There's something terrible happening."""
97.766	"And she said, ""Don't be so silly."""
99.783	And I started to cry.
102.383	And she got it, she said,
104.598	"""Okay, I see it's serious."
106.365	You're much too young to help.
109.199	You need training. I'll help you.
111.834	"But just unpack your suitcase."""
113.999	And so I got some training
117.565	and went and worked in Africa during most of my 20s.
121.498	But I realized that what I really needed to know
125.199	I couldn't get from training courses.
127.598	I wanted to understand
129.784	how violence, how oppression, works.
134.234	And what I've discovered since is this:
139.182	Bullies use violence in three ways.
143.248	They use political violence to intimidate,
148.551	physical violence to terrorize
153.965	and mental or emotional violence to undermine.
161.489	And only very rarely in very few cases
164.716	does it work to use more violence.
168.232	Nelson Mandela went to jail believing in violence,
174.441	and 27 years later
176.465	he and his colleagues
178.448	had slowly and carefully
180.433	honed the skills, the incredible skills, that they needed
185.399	to turn one of the most vicious governments the world has known
189.599	into a democracy.
191.465	And they did it in a total devotion to non-violence.
196.197	They realized that using force against force
203.364	doesn't work.
208.56	So what does work?
210.753	Over time I've collected about a half-dozen methods
214.222	that do work -- of course there are many more --
216.055	that do work and that are effective.
218.401	And the first is
219.768	that the change that has to take place
222.286	has to take place here, inside me.
226.751	It's my response, my attitude, to oppression
230.851	that I've got control over,
233.702	and that I can do something about.
236.002	And what I need to develop is self-knowledge to do that.
240.185	That means I need to know how I tick,
242.684	when I collapse,
244.935	where my formidable points are,
249.269	where my weaker points are.
251.767	When do I give in?
253.235	What will I stand up for?
258.498	And meditation or self-inspection
263.637	is one of the ways -- again it's not the only one --
266.171	it's one of the ways
267.289	of gaining this kind of inner power.
271.406	And my heroine here -- like Satish's --
273.888	is Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma.
276.921	She was leading a group of students
280.554	on a protest in the streets of Rangoon.
282.954	They came around a corner faced with a row of machine guns.
287.137	And she realized straight away
288.304	that the soldiers with their fingers shaking on the triggers
292.222	were more scared than the student protesters behind her.
297.92	But she told the students to sit down.
300.625	And she walked forward with such calm and such clarity
307.921	and such total lack of fear
311.371	that she could walk right up to the first gun,
315.471	put her hand on it and lower it.
323.824	And no one got killed.
327.357	So that's what the mastery of fear can do --
331.299	not only faced with machine guns,
333.6	but if you meet a knife fight in the street.
337.766	But we have to practice.
340.131	So what about our fear?
342.032	I have a little mantra.
346.986	My fear grows fat
350.427	on the energy I feed it.
352.644	And if it grows very big
354.931	it probably happens.
357.293	So we all know the three o'clock in the morning syndrome,
361.728	when something you've been worrying about wakes you up --
364.444	I see a lot of people --
366.834	and for an hour you toss and turn,
370.444	it gets worse and worse,
372.122	and by four o'clock you're pinned to the pillow
375.244	by a monster this big.
377.447	The only thing to do
379.381	is to get up, make a cup of tea
381.215	and sit down with the fear like a child beside you.
386.531	You're the adult.
389.012	The fear is the child.
390.899	And you talk to the fear
392.344	and you ask it what it wants, what it needs.
395.53	How can this be made better?
400.147	How can the child feel stronger?
401.897	And you make a plan.
403.346	"And you say, ""Okay, now we're going back to sleep."
405.351	"Half-past seven, we're getting up and that's what we're going to do."""
409.118	I had one of these 3 a.m. episodes on Sunday --
414.866	paralyzed with fear at coming to talk to you.
418.851	(Laughter)
420.849	So I did the thing.
422.356	I got up, made the cup of tea, sat down with it, did it all
426.485	and I'm here -- still partly paralyzed, but I'm here.
430.641	(Applause)
435.04	So that's fear. What about anger?
437.556	Wherever there is injustice there's anger.
441.958	But anger is like gasoline,
444.806	and if you spray it around and somebody lights a match,
448.26	you've got an inferno.
450.26	But anger as an engine -- in an engine -- is powerful.
455.377	If we can put our anger inside an engine,
459.543	it can drive us forward,
461.326	it can get us through the dreadful moments
464.314	and it can give us real inner power.
468.277	And I learned this in my work
471.395	with nuclear weapon policy-makers.
473.659	Because at the beginning I was so outraged
476.378	at the dangers they were exposing us to
479.694	that I just wanted to argue and blame and make them wrong.
484.828	Totally ineffective.
487.361	In order to develop a dialogue for change
491.11	we have to deal with our anger.
493.183	It's okay to be angry with the thing --
497.86	the nuclear weapons in this case --
499.96	but it is hopeless to be angry with the people.
503.811	They are human beings just like us.
506.426	And they're doing what they think is best.
509.077	And that's the basis on which we have to talk with them.
513.06	So that's the third one, anger.
515.977	And it brings me to the crux
517.377	of what's going on, or what I perceive as going on,
520.611	in the world today,
521.676	which is that last century was top-down power.
525.694	It was still governments telling people what to do.
529.959	This century there's a shift.
531.994	It's bottom-up or grassroots power.
535.877	It's like mushrooms coming through concrete.
539.093	It's people joining up with people, as Bundy just said, miles away
545.774	to bring about change.
548.047	And Peace Direct spotted quite early on
552.313	that local people in areas of very hot conflict
555.864	know what to do.
558.3	They know best what to do.
560.516	So Peace Direct gets behind them to do that.
563.798	And the kind of thing they're doing
565.997	is demobilizing militias,
569.165	rebuilding economies,
571.768	resettling refugees,
574.118	even liberating child soldiers.
579.619	And they have to risk their lives almost every day
582.485	to do this.
585.704	And what they've realized
589.518	is that using violence in the situations they operate in
594.451	is not only less humane,
598.97	but it's less effective
601.105	than using methods that connect people with people, that rebuild.
607.636	And I think that the U.S. military
611.568	is finally beginning to get this.
618.448	Up to now their counter-terrorism policy
621.157	has been to kill insurgents at almost any cost,
625.99	and if civilians get in the way,
629.193	"that's written as ""collateral damage."""
633.459	And this is so infuriating and humiliating
640.192	for the population of Afghanistan,
642.542	that it makes the recruitment for al-Qaeda very easy,
646.89	when people are so disgusted by, for example,
650.06	the burning of the Koran.
652.439	So the training of the troops has to change.
655.44	And I think there are signs that it is beginning to change.
660.548	The British military have always been much better at this.
663.332	But there is one magnificent example for them to take their cue from,
669.014	and that's a brilliant U.S. lieutenant colonel
672.182	called Chris Hughes.
673.847	And he was leading his men down the streets of Najaf --
678.064	in Iraq actually --
680.232	and suddenly people were pouring out of the houses on either side of the road,
685.265	screaming, yelling, furiously angry,
689.863	and surrounded these very young troops who were completely terrified,
694.331	didn't know what was going on, couldn't speak Arabic.
696.831	And Chris Hughes strode into the middle of the throng
701.081	with his weapon above his head, pointing at the ground,
704.95	"and he said, ""Kneel."""
706.648	And these huge soldiers
709.448	with their backpacks and their body armor,
712.081	wobbled to the ground.
716.555	And complete silence fell.
722.64	And after about two minutes,
725.198	everybody moved aside and went home.
729.474	Now that to me is wisdom in action.
734.956	In the moment, that's what he did.
739.122	And it's happening everywhere now.
744.884	You don't believe me?
746.793	Have you asked yourselves
750.452	why and how so many dictatorships have collapsed
754.892	over the last 30 years?
758.243	Dictatorships in Czechoslovakia, East Germany,
763.31	Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,
767.525	Mali, Madagascar,
770.411	Poland, the Philippines,
774.193	Serbia, Slovenia, I could go on,
779.276	and now Tunisia and Egypt.
783.866	And this hasn't just happened.
787.916	A lot of it is due to a book
791.067	written by an 80-year-old man in Boston, Gene Sharp.
795.532	"He wrote a book called ""From Dictatorship to Democracy"""
799.549	with 81 methodologies for non-violent resistance.
804.945	And it's been translated into 26 languages.
807.032	It's flown around the world.
809.116	And it's being used by young people and older people everywhere,
816.303	because it works and it's effective.
821.725	So this is what gives me hope --
826.283	not just hope, this is what makes me feel very positive right now.
830.036	Because finally human beings are getting it.
834.052	We're getting practical, doable methodologies
841.67	to answer my question:
843.254	How do we deal with a bully without becoming a thug?
849.556	We're using the kind of skills that I've outlined:
853.966	inner power -- the development of inner power -- through self-knowledge,
857.684	recognizing and working with our fear,
861.25	using anger as a fuel,
864.768	cooperating with others,
867.333	banding together with others,
869.268	courage,
871.45	and most importantly, commitment to active non-violence.
878.419	Now I don't just believe in non-violence.
882.533	I don't have to believe in it.
885.468	I see evidence everywhere of how it works.
889.018	And I see that we, ordinary people,
895.068	can do what Aung San Suu Kyi and Ghandi and Mandela did.
901.386	We can bring to an end
904.109	the bloodiest century that humanity has ever known.
909.108	And we can organize to overcome oppression
917.049	by opening our hearts
919.667	as well as strengthening this incredible resolve.
925.517	And this open-heartedness is exactly what I've experienced
930.117	in the entire organization of this gathering since I got here yesterday.
934.551	Thank you.
936.672	(Applause)
