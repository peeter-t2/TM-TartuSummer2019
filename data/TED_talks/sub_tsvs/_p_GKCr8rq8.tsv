12.742	So we humans have an extraordinary
12.742	potential for goodness,
19.963	but also an immense power to do harm.
24.363	Any tool can be used to build
24.363	or to destroy.
30.036	That all depends on our motivation.
33.217	Therefore, it is all the more important
36.664	to foster an altruistic motivation
36.664	rather than a selfish one.
42.508	So now we indeed are facing 
42.508	many challenges in our times.
49.008	Those could be personal challenges.
52.325	Our own mind can be our best friend
52.325	or our worst enemy.
58.341	There's also societal challenges:
61.225	poverty in the midst of plenty,
61.225	inequalities, conflict, injustice.
66.924	And then there are the new challenges,
66.924	which we don't expect.
71.12	Ten thousand years ago, there were
71.12	about five million human beings on Earth.
75.763	Whatever they could do,
77.373	the Earth's resilience 
77.373	would soon heal human activities.
82.559	After the Industrial
82.559	and Technological Revolutions,
85.775	that's not the same anymore.
88.008	We are now the major agent
88.008	of impact on our Earth.
92.073	We enter the Anthropocene,
92.073	the era of human beings.
96.977	So in a way, if we were to say
96.977	we need to continue this endless growth,
103.97	endless use of material resources,
107.616	it's like if this man was saying --
110.514	and I heard a former head of state,
110.514	I won't mention who, saying --
115.386	"""Five years ago, we were at"
115.386	the edge of the precipice.
119.395	"Today we made a big step forward."""
122.587	So this edge is the same
122.587	that has been defined by scientists
128.59	as the planetary boundaries.
131.244	And within those boundaries,
131.244	they can carry a number of factors.
135.705	We can still prosper, humanity can still
135.705	prosper for 150,000 years
141.231	if we keep the same stability of climate
144.563	as in the Holocene
144.563	for the last 10,000 years.
147.721	But this depends on choosing
147.721	a voluntary simplicity,
153.479	growing qualitatively, not quantitatively.
156.16	So in 1900, as you can see,
156.16	we were well within the limits of safety.
162.394	Now, in 1950 came the great acceleration.
167.793	Now hold your breath, not too long,
167.793	to imagine what comes next.
172.762	Now we have vastly overrun
172.762	some of the planetary boundaries.
178.907	Just to take biodiversity, 
178.907	at the current rate,
182.866	by 2050, 30 percent of all species 
182.866	on Earth will have disappeared.
189.288	Even if we keep their DNA in some fridge,
189.288	that's not going to be reversible.
195.085	So here I am sitting
196.936	in front of a 7,000-meter-high, 
202.836	At the Third Pole, 2,000 glaciers
202.836	are melting fast, faster than the Arctic.
209.987	So what can we do in that situation?
214.144	Well, however complex
214.144	politically, economically, scientifically
221.453	the question of the environment is,
223.851	it simply boils down to a question
223.851	of altruism versus selfishness.
230.678	I'm a Marxist of the Groucho tendency.
234.287	(Laughter)
235.712	"Groucho Marx said, ""Why should I care"
235.712	about future generations?
239.121	"What have they ever done for me?"""
241.151	(Laughter)
242.647	Unfortunately, I heard
242.647	the billionaire Steve Forbes,
247.43	on Fox News, saying exactly 
247.43	the same thing, but seriously.
250.958	He was told about the rise of the ocean,
253.293	"and he said, ""I find it absurd"
253.293	to change my behavior today
256.64	for something that will happen 
256.64	"in a hundred years."""
259.695	So if you don't care
259.695	for future generations,
262.593	just go for it.
265.494	So one of the main challenges of our times
268.42	is to reconcile three time scales:
271.538	the short term of the economy,
273.683	the ups and downs of the stock market,
273.683	the end-of-the-year accounts;
277.915	the midterm of the quality of life --
280.621	what is the quality every moment of our 
280.621	life, over 10 years and 20 years? --
285.945	and the long term of the environment.
289.554	When the environmentalists
289.554	speak with economists,
291.903	it's like a schizophrenic dialogue,
291.903	completely incoherent.
294.982	They don't speak the same language.
297.814	Now, for the last 10 years,
297.814	I went around the world
301.354	meeting economists, scientists,
301.354	neuroscientists, environmentalists,
305.452	philosophers, thinkers 
305.452	in the Himalayas, all over the place.
309.912	It seems to me, there's only one concept
313.834	that can reconcile
313.834	those three time scales.
316.794	It is simply having more
316.794	consideration for others.
321.198	If you have more consideration for others,
321.198	you will have a caring economics,
326.099	where finance is at the service of society
329.051	and not society at the service of finance.
332.319	You will not play at the casino
334.187	with the resources that people
334.187	have entrusted you with.
337.073	If you have more consideration for others,
339.919	you will make sure
339.919	that you remedy inequality,
343.396	that you bring some kind 
343.396	of well-being within society,
347.136	in education, at the workplace.
349.176	Otherwise, a nation that is
349.176	the most powerful and the richest
352.599	but everyone is miserable,
352.599	what's the point?
355.686	And if you have more
355.686	consideration for others,
357.973	you are not going to ransack
357.973	that planet that we have
361.369	and at the current rate, we don't
361.369	have three planets to continue that way.
365.703	So the question is,
368.056	okay, altruism is the answer,
368.056	it's not just a novel ideal,
372.387	but can it be a real, pragmatic solution?
375.611	And first of all, does it exist,
378.469	true altruism, or are we so selfish?
382.213	So some philosophers thought
382.213	we were irredeemably selfish.
387.553	But are we really all just like rascals?
392.765	That's good news, isn't it?
395.579	Many philosophers, 
395.579	like Hobbes, have said so.
398.108	But not everyone looks like a rascal.
401.429	Or is man a wolf for man?
404.262	But this guy doesn't seem too bad.
407.15	He's one of my friends in Tibet.
410.073	He's very kind.
412.312	So now, we love cooperation.
415.937	There's no better joy 
415.937	than working together, is there?
420.275	And then not only humans.
424.35	Then, of course, there's
424.35	the struggle for life,
426.837	the survival of the fittest,
426.837	social Darwinism.
431.178	But in evolution, cooperation --
431.178	though competition exists, of course --
437.015	cooperation has to be much more creative
437.015	to go to increased levels of complexity.
442.732	We are super-cooperators 
442.732	and we should even go further.
447.414	So now, on top of that,
447.414	the quality of human relationships.
453.443	The OECD did a survey among 10 factors,
453.443	including income, everything.
457.925	The first one that people said,
457.925	that's the main thing for my happiness,
461.268	is quality of social relationships.
464.621	Not only in humans.
467.498	And look at those great-grandmothers.
470.846	So now, this idea 
470.846	that if we go deep within,
476	we are irredeemably selfish,
478.57	this is armchair science.
481.224	There is not a single sociological study,
483.491	psychological study,
483.491	that's ever shown that.
486.737	Rather, the opposite.
488.697	My friend, Daniel Batson, 
488.697	spent a whole life
492.355	putting people in the lab
492.355	in very complex situations.
495.118	And of course we are sometimes selfish,
495.118	and some people more than others.
499.487	But he found that systematically,
499.487	no matter what,
502.149	there's a significant number of people
505.149	who do behave altruistically,
505.149	no matter what.
508.504	If you see someone
508.504	deeply wounded, great suffering,
511.696	you might just help
511.696	out of empathic distress --
514.318	you can't stand it, so it's better to help
514.318	than to keep on looking at that person.
518.468	So we tested all that, and in the end, 
518.468	he said, clearly people can be altruistic.
524.344	So that's good news.
526.284	And even further, we should look
526.284	at the banality of goodness.
531.896	Now look at here.
533.6	When we come out, we aren't 
533.6	"going to say, ""That's so nice."
536.37	There was no fistfight while this mob 
536.37	"was thinking about altruism."""
540.937	No, that's expected, isn't it?
543.099	If there was a fistfight,
543.099	we would speak of that for months.
546.278	So the banality of goodness is something
546.278	that doesn't attract your attention,
549.949	but it exists.
551.437	Now, look at this.
561.253	So some psychologists said,
564.054	when I tell them I run 140 humanitarian 
564.054	projects in the Himalayas
567.291	that give me so much joy,
569.545	"they said, ""Oh, I see,"
569.545	you work for the warm glow.
572.799	That is not altruistic.
572.799	"You just feel good."""
575.703	You think this guy,
575.703	when he jumped in front of the train,
578.991	"he thought, ""I'm going to feel"
578.991	"so good when this is over?"""
581.277	(Laughter)
583.563	But that's not the end of it.
585.849	They say, well, but when
585.849	you interviewed him, he said,
588.391	"""I had no choice."
588.391	"I had to jump, of course."""
591.526	He has no choice. Automatic behavior.
591.526	It's neither selfish nor altruistic.
595.407	No choice?
596.882	Well of course, this guy's
596.882	not going to think for half an hour,
599.844	"""Should I give my hand? Not give my hand?"""
601.881	He does it. There is a choice,
601.881	but it's obvious, it's immediate.
605.676	And then, also, there he had a choice.
608.037	(Laughter)
610.738	There are people who had choice,
610.738	like Pastor André Trocmé and his wife,
614.5	and the whole village
614.5	of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon in France.
617.187	For the whole Second World War,
617.187	they saved 3,500 Jews,
621.135	gave them shelter,
621.135	brought them to Switzerland,
623.792	against all odds, at the risk
623.792	of their lives and those of their family.
627.237	So altruism does exist.
629.394	So what is altruism?
631.119	It is the wish: May others be happy
631.119	and find the cause of happiness.
635.021	Now, empathy is the affective resonance
635.021	or cognitive resonance that tells you,
640.266	this person is joyful,
640.266	this person suffers.
642.977	But empathy alone is not sufficient.
646.463	If you keep on being
646.463	confronted with suffering,
648.686	you might have empathic distress, burnout,
651.447	so you need the greater sphere
651.447	of loving-kindness.
655.507	With Tania Singer at the Max Planck 
655.507	Institute of Leipzig,
658.234	we showed that the brain networks for
658.234	empathy and loving-kindness are different.
664.335	Now, that's all well done,
666.416	so we got that from evolution,
666.416	from maternal care, parental love,
671.79	but we need to extend that.
673.625	It can be extended even to other species.
676.968	Now, if we want a more altruistic society,
676.968	we need two things:
681.375	individual change and societal change.
684.592	So is individual change possible?
687.15	Two thousand years
687.15	of contemplative study said yes, it is.
690.349	Now, 15 years of collaboration
690.349	with neuroscience and epigenetics
693.951	said yes, our brains change
693.951	when you train in altruism.
698.435	So I spent 120 hours in an MRI machine.
702.707	This is the first time I went
702.707	after two and a half hours.
705.493	And then the result has been published
705.493	in many scientific papers.
709.167	It shows without ambiguity
709.167	that there is structural change
712.749	and functional change in the brain
712.749	when you train the altruistic love.
716.502	Just to give you an idea:
718.252	this is the meditator at rest on the left,
721.073	meditator in compassion meditation,
721.073	you see all the activity,
724.776	and then the control group at rest,
724.776	nothing happened,
727.33	in meditation, nothing happened.
729.272	They have not been trained.
731.25	So do you need 50,000 hours 
731.25	of meditation? No, you don't.
735.671	Four weeks, 20 minutes a day,
735.671	of caring, mindfulness meditation
739.838	already brings a structural change
739.838	in the brain compared to a control group.
746.141	That's only 20 minutes a day
746.141	for four weeks.
749.879	Even with preschoolers --
749.879	Richard Davidson did that in Madison.
753.217	An eight-week program: gratitude, loving-
753.217	kindness, cooperation, mindful breathing.
759.627	You would say, 
759.627	"""Oh, they're just preschoolers."""
761.882	Look after eight weeks,
763.508	the pro-social behavior,
763.508	that's the blue line.
765.958	And then comes the ultimate
765.958	scientific test, the stickers test.
771.402	Before, you determine for each child
771.402	who is their best friend in the class,
775.35	their least favorite child,
775.35	an unknown child, and the sick child,
779.425	and they have to give stickers away.
782.129	So before the intervention,
782.129	they give most of it to their best friend.
786.181	Four, five years old, 
789.64	After the intervention,
789.64	no more discrimination:
793.123	the same amount of stickers to their 
793.123	best friend and the least favorite child.
797.048	That's something we should do
797.048	in all the schools in the world.
800.436	Now where do we go from there?
802.43	(Applause)
806.678	When the Dalai Lama heard that,
806.678	he told Richard Davidson,
809.359	"""You go to 10 schools, 100 schools,"
809.359	"the U.N., the whole world."""
812.815	So now where do we go from there?
814.499	Individual change is possible.
816.762	Now do we have to wait for an altruistic 
816.762	gene to be in the human race?
821.378	That will take 50,000 years,
821.378	too much for the environment.
825.132	Fortunately, there is
825.132	the evolution of culture.
829.567	Cultures, as specialists have shown,
829.567	change faster than genes.
835.301	That's the good news.
836.829	Look, attitude towards war
836.829	has dramatically changed over the years.
840.189	So now individual change and cultural 
840.189	change mutually fashion each other,
845.37	and yes, we can achieve
845.37	a more altruistic society.
848.146	So where do we go from there?
849.888	Myself, I will go back to the East.
852.137	Now we treat 100,000 patients
852.137	a year in our projects.
855.597	We have 25,000 kids in school,
855.597	four percent overhead.
859.346	"Some people say, ""Well,"
859.346	your stuff works in practice,
861.921	"but does it work in theory?"""
863.945	There's always positive deviance.
867.287	So I will also go back to my hermitage
869.706	to find the inner resources
869.706	to better serve others.
872.995	But on the more global level,
872.995	what can we do?
876.182	We need three things.
877.973	Enhancing cooperation:
880.325	Cooperative learning in the school
880.325	instead of competitive learning,
884.041	Unconditional cooperation
884.041	within corporations --
887.612	there can be some competition
887.612	between corporations, but not within.
892.019	We need sustainable harmony.
892.019	I love this term.
895.971	Not sustainable growth anymore.
897.914	Sustainable harmony means now
897.914	we will reduce inequality.
901.5	In the future, we do more with less,
905.826	and we continue to grow qualitatively,
905.826	not quantitatively.
910.31	We need caring economics.
912.615	The Homo economicus cannot deal
912.615	with poverty in the midst of plenty,
918.446	cannot deal with the problem
918.446	of the common goods
920.798	of the atmosphere, of the oceans.
923.096	We need a caring economics.
924.679	If you say economics
924.679	should be compassionate,
926.788	"they say, ""That's not our job."""
928.273	But if you say they don't care,
928.273	that looks bad.
931.588	We need local commitment,
931.588	global responsibility.
934.967	We need to extend altruism
934.967	to the other 1.6 million species.
940.307	Sentient beings 
940.307	are co-citizens in this world.
943.732	and we need to dare altruism.
946.724	So, long live the altruistic revolution.
950.605	Viva la revolución de altruismo.
955.155	(Applause)
960.515	Thank you.
962.496	(Applause)
