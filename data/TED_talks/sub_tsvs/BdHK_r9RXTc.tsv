39.972	(French) Mais Des fois on peut voir
39.972	parce Que Les gens
44.224	ici faire Des choses on peut manger.
46.997	(French) Mais quand
46.997	tu es fâché avec quelqu'un
50.553	c'est pas passé the first time.
52.445	(British English) And that's one
52.445	of the things that I enjoy most
55.738	about this convention.
59.223	It's not so much, as so little
59.223	has to do with what everything is.
66.288	(Laughter)
69.988	But it is within our self-interest
72.122	to understand the topography of our lives
75.076	unto ourselves.
76.856	(Laughter)
81.135	The future states that there is no time
85.219	other than the collapsation
85.219	of that sensation
88.545	of the mirror of the memories
88.545	in which we are living.
91.191	(Laughter)
94.567	Common knowledge,
96.428	but important nonetheless.
97.968	(Laughter)
101.382	As we face fear in these times,
103.74	and fear is all around us,
105.774	we also have anti-fear.
108.345	It's hard to imagine or measure.
110.846	The background radiation
110.846	is simply too static
113.966	to be able to be seen
113.966	under the normal spectral analysis.
118.189	(American accent) But we feel
118.189	as though there are times
121.053	when a lot of us --
121.053	you know what I'm saying?
123.53	But -- you know what I'm saying?
125.398	Because, as a hip hop thing,
125.398	you know what I'm saying,
127.961	TED be rocking --
127.961	you know what I'm saying.
130.246	Like so I wrote a song,
133.172	and I hope you guys dig it.
135.274	It's a song about people
137.52	and sasquatches --
139.297	(Laughter)
142.575	And other French science stuff.
145.06	That's French science.
146.147	Okay, here we go.
150.25	(Singing) I've been trying inside
157.199	I know that I'm in trouble
162.905	(Applause)
164.239	that I'm in trouble
170.185	by myself
174.373	But every time it gets me
178.039	(Vocalization)
188.443	(Beatbox)
218.449	(Singing) And I've been trying
218.449	to be the one that you believe in
223.95	And you're the one
223.95	that I want to be so saucy
229.166	And you're the one
229.166	I want to [unclear], baby
233.981	And you can do anything
236.446	as long as you don't get hurt
236.446	along the way back
239.319	(Beatbox)
240.699	If I survive, I'm going
240.699	to tell you what is wrong
245.46	Because if you were [unclear]
250.328	And I think that you're looking
250.328	like a [unclear]
256.082	I give you what I want to be
261.366	(Music)
274.829	(Music ends abruptly)
276.504	(British accent) And it's like,
278.48	you could use as many
278.48	of those things that you want.
281.346	(Applause)
285.792	And the computer models,
287.434	no matter how many that you have
288.992	and how many people that you use,
290.588	are never going to be able to arrive
290.588	at the same conclusions.
294.372	Four years ago I worked with a few people
294.372	at the Brookings Institute,
298.028	and I arrived at a conclusion.
300.146	(Laughter)
307.604	Tomorrow is another day.
309.246	(Laughter)
311.962	Not just any day,
313.685	but it is a day.
315.84	It will get here, there's no question.
319.613	And the important thing to remember
321.716	is that this simulation is a good one.
325.422	It's believable, it's tactile.
328	You can reach out -- things are solid.
329.905	You can move objects
329.905	from one area to another.
333.126	You can feel your body.
334.688	"You can say, ""I'd like to go over"
334.688	"to this location,"""
337.166	and you can move this mass
337.166	of molecules through the air
340.401	over to another location, at will.
342.691	(Laughter)
345.861	That's something
345.861	you live inside of every day.
350.229	Now with the allocation
350.229	and the understanding
353.056	of the lack of understanding,
354.53	we enter into a new era of science
357.121	in which we feel nothing more
359.757	than so much so as to say
362.01	that those within themselves,
364.136	comporary or non-comporary,
367.248	will figuratively figure
368.773	into the folding of our non-understanding
372.021	and our partial understanding
373.882	to the networks
373.882	of which we all draw our source
377.169	and conclusions from.
378.491	(Laughter)
380.058	So, as I say before the last piece,
385.132	feel not as though
385.132	it is a sphere we live on,
388.561	rather an infinite plane
388.561	which has the illusion
392.633	of leading yourself
392.633	back to the point of origin.
395.317	(Laughter)
396.674	Once we understand
396.674	that all the spheres in the sky
399.033	are just large infinite planes,
401.126	it will be plain to see.
402.572	(Laughter)
403.597	(Audience) (Laughter)
405.73	This is my final piece.
407.619	And just remember,
409.212	everything you are --
411.082	it's more important to realize
411.082	the negative space,
415.852	as music is only the division of space;
418.758	it is the space
418.758	we are listening to divided as such,
421.79	which gives us the information
421.79	in comparison to something other
425.419	that gives us the idea of what the idea
425.419	that wants to be transmitted
429.161	wants to be.
430.235	So please, without further ado.
431.877	(Applause)
433.941	Thank you.
435.041	(Applause)
439.299	This is a fun one.
441.117	It goes like this.
442.155	(Beatbox)
449.172	(Gibberish)
467.018	(Music ends)
468.565	Okay, for the last piece I'd like to do,
470.74	this one goes very similar to this.
473.19	I hope you guys recognize it.
474.615	Here we go.
480.693	Okay, that still works. Okay, good.
483.056	All right, here we go.
484.134	(Laughter)
487.566	(Beatbox)
499.001	Here we go.
500.24	(Beatbox)
508.597	Yeah, yo, yo, yo
512.246	(Gibberish)
558.809	(Music fades out)
560.714	Thank you. Enjoy the rest.
562.477	(Applause)
