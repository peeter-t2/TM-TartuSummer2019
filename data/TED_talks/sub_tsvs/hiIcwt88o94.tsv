12.56	We are stealing nature from our children.
16.84	Now, when I say this, I don't mean
16.84	that we are destroying nature
19.92	that they will have wanted us to preserve,
22.32	although that is
22.32	unfortunately also the case.
25	What I mean here is that we've started
25	to define nature in a way
28.84	that's so purist and so strict
31.88	that under the definition
31.88	we're creating for ourselves,
34.64	there won't be any nature
34.64	left for our children
37.04	when they're adults.
39.12	But there's a fix for this.
41.68	So let me explain.
43.68	Right now, humans use half of the world
47.16	to live, to grow their crops
47.16	and their timber,
49.88	to pasture their animals.
51.8	If you added up all the human beings,
53.64	we would weigh 10 times as much
53.64	as all the wild mammals put together.
58.8	We cut roads through the forest.
61.68	We have added little plastic particles
61.68	to the sand on ocean beaches.
66.04	We've changed the chemistry of the soil
66.04	with our artificial fertilizers.
71.16	And of course, we've changed
71.16	the chemistry of the air.
74.4	So when you take your next breath,
76.28	you'll be breathing in
80.16	than if you were breathing in 1750.
83.28	So all of these changes, and many others,
85.76	have come to be kind of lumped together
85.76	"under this rubric of the ""Anthropocene."""
90.48	And this is a term
90.48	that some geologists are suggesting
93.04	we should give to our current epoch,
94.88	given how pervasive
94.88	human influence has been over it.
98.32	Now, it's still just a proposed epoch,
98.32	but I think it's a helpful way
102.2	to think about the magnitude
102.2	of human influence on the planet.
106.8	So where does this put nature?
108.52	What counts as nature in a world
108.52	where everything is influenced by humans?
113.4	So 25 years ago, environmental writer
113.4	Bill McKibben said
117.6	that because nature
117.6	was a thing apart from man
122.12	and because climate change meant
123.72	that every centimeter of the Earth
123.72	was altered by man,
127.36	then nature was over.
129.48	In fact, he called his book
129.48	"""The End of Nature."""
134	I disagree with this.
134	I just disagree with this.
136.28	I disagree with this definition of nature,
136.28	because, fundamentally, we are animals.
140.639	Right? Like, we evolved on this planet
143.48	in the context of all the other animals
143.48	with which we share a planet,
147.6	and all the other plants,
147.6	and all the other microbes.
150.2	And so I think that nature
152.52	is not that which is untouched
152.52	by humanity, man or woman.
156.6	I think that nature
156.6	is anywhere where life thrives,
160.76	anywhere where there are
160.76	multiple species together,
163.8	anywhere that's green and blue
163.8	and thriving and filled with life
167.04	and growing.
169.6	And under that definition,
171.52	things look a little bit different.
174.08	Now, I understand that there
174.08	are certain parts of this nature
177.8	that speak to us in a special way.
180.44	Places like Yellowstone,
182.12	or the Mongolian steppe,
183.84	or the Great Barrier Reef
185.2	or the Serengeti.
186.72	Places that we think of
186.72	as kind of Edenic representations
190.76	of a nature before
190.76	we screwed everything up.
194.56	And in a way, they are less impacted
194.56	by our day to day activities.
198.6	Many of these places
198.6	have no roads or few roads,
201.32	so on, like such.
202.92	But ultimately, even these Edens
202.92	are deeply influenced by humans.
208.72	Now, let's just take
208.72	North America, for example,
211	since that's where we're meeting.
212.64	So between about 15,000 years ago
212.64	when people first came here,
216.08	they started a process
216.08	of interacting with the nature
218.6	that led to the extinction
218.6	of a big slew of large-bodied animals,
223	from the mastodon
223	to the giant ground sloth,
225.28	saber-toothed cats,
226.56	all of these cool animals
226.56	that unfortunately are no longer with us.
230.2	And when those animals went extinct,
232.04	you know, the ecosystems
232.04	didn't stand still.
234.64	Massive ripple effects
234.64	changed grasslands into forests,
238.28	changed the composition of forest
238.28	from one tree to another.
242	So even in these Edens,
243.68	even in these perfect-looking places
245.52	that seem to remind us
245.52	of a past before humans,
249.04	we're essentially looking
249.04	at a humanized landscape.
252.96	Not just these prehistoric humans,
252.96	but historical humans, indigenous people
256.56	all the way up until the moment
256.56	when the first colonizers showed up.
260.48	And the case is the same
260.48	for the other continents as well.
263.28	Humans have just been involved in nature
266.12	in a very influential way
266.12	for a very long time.
270.44	Now, just recently, someone told me,
272.24	"""Oh, but there are still wild places."""
274.12	"And I said, ""Where? Where? I want to go."""
276.36	"And he said, ""The Amazon."""
278.28	"And I was like, ""Oh, the Amazon."
278.28	I was just there.
281.76	It's awesome. National Geographic
281.76	sent me to Man√∫ National Park,
284.92	which is in the Peruvian Amazon,
286.52	but it's a big chunk of rainforest,
286.52	uncleared, no roads,
290.2	protected as a national park,
291.84	one of the most, in fact,
291.84	biodiverse parks in the world.
294.56	And when I got in there with my canoe,
294.56	what did I find, but people.
299.64	People have been living there
299.64	for hundreds and thousands of years.
303.48	People live there, and they don't
303.48	just float over the jungle.
306.36	They have a meaningful relationship
306.36	with the landscape.
309.48	They hunt. They grow crops.
311.8	They domesticate crops.
313.32	They use the natural resources
313.32	to build their houses,
316.24	to thatch their houses.
317.52	They even make pets out of animals
317.52	that we consider to be wild animals.
321.56	These people are there
323.68	and they're interacting
323.68	with the environment
325.8	in a way that's really meaningful
325.8	and that you can see in the environment.
329.32	Now, I was with
329.32	an anthropologist on this trip,
331.56	and he told me, as we were
331.56	floating down the river,
334.44	"he said, ""There are"
334.44	"no demographic voids in the Amazon."""
339.12	This statement has really stuck with me,
341.08	because what it means
341.08	is that the whole Amazon is like this.
343.96	There's people everywhere.
345.88	And many other
345.88	tropical forests are the same,
348.24	and not just tropical forests.
349.84	People have influenced
349.84	ecosystems in the past,
353.08	and they continue
353.08	to influence them in the present,
355.88	even in places where
355.88	they're harder to notice.
359.72	So, if all of the definitions of nature
359.72	that we might want to use
364.96	that involve it being
364.96	untouched by humanity
367.96	or not having people in it,
369.32	if all of those actually give us
369.32	a result where we don't have any nature,
374.68	then maybe they're the wrong definitions.
377.12	Maybe we should define it
377.12	by the presence of multiple species,
380.64	by the presence of a thriving life.
383.44	Now, if we do it that way,
385.48	what do we get?
386.96	Well, it's this kind of miracle.
389.36	All of a sudden,
389.36	there's nature all around us.
392.16	All of a sudden,
392.16	we see this Monarch caterpillar
394.88	munching on this plant,
396.76	and we realize that there it is,
398.6	and it's in this empty lot in Chattanooga.
402.32	And look at this empty lot.
403.68	I mean, there's, like, probably,
405.48	a dozen, minimum,
405.48	plant species growing there,
408.44	supporting all kinds of insect life,
410.72	and this is a completely unmanaged space,
410.72	a completely wild space.
415.08	This is a kind of wild nature
415.08	right under our nose,
418.08	that we don't even notice.
420.76	And there's an interesting
420.76	little paradox, too.
423	So this nature,
424.84	this kind of wild, untended part
427.52	of our urban, peri-urban,
427.52	suburban agricultural existence
431.32	that flies under the radar,
433.72	it's arguably more wild
433.72	than a national park,
438.16	because national parks
438.16	are very carefully managed
440.6	in the 21st century.
442.36	Crater Lake in southern Oregon,
442.36	which is my closest national park,
445.96	is a beautiful example of a landscape
445.96	that seems to be coming out of the past.
451.16	But they're managing it carefully.
452.92	One of the issues they have now
452.92	is white bark pine die-off.
456.52	White bark pine
456.52	is a beautiful, charismatic --
459.04	I'll say it's a charismatic megaflora
462.08	that grows up at high altitude --
463.76	and it's got all these problems
463.76	right now with disease.
466.76	There's a blister rust
466.76	that was introduced,
468.92	bark beetle.
470.44	So to deal with this,
470.44	the park service has been planting
474.04	rust-resistant white bark
474.04	pine seedlings in the park,
478.56	even in areas that they are
478.56	otherwise managing as wilderness.
482.2	And they're also putting out
482.2	beetle repellent in key areas
485.04	as I saw last time I went hiking there.
487.64	And this kind of thing is really
487.64	much more common than you would think.
491	National parks are heavily managed.
492.72	The wildlife is kept to a certain
492.72	population size and structure.
495.8	Fires are suppressed.
497.36	Fires are started.
498.68	Non-native species are removed.
500.88	Native species are reintroduced.
502.6	And in fact, I took a look,
503.96	and Banff National Park
503.96	is doing all of the things I just listed:
507.04	suppressing fire, having fire,
508.52	radio-collaring wolves,
508.52	reintroducing bison.
510.76	It takes a lot of work to make
510.76	these places look untouched.
514	(Laughter)
517.08	(Applause)
523.08	And in a further irony,
523.08	these places that we love the most
527.559	are the places that we love
527.559	a little too hard, sometimes.
530.28	A lot of us like to go there,
531.72	and because we're managing
531.72	them to be stable
534.28	in the face of a changing planet,
536.36	they often are becoming
536.36	more fragile over time.
539.44	Which means that they're
539.44	the absolute worst places
541.92	to take your children on vacation,
543.88	because you can't do anything there.
545.8	You can't climb the trees.
547.12	You can't fish the fish.
548.36	You can't make a campfire
548.36	out in the middle of nowhere.
551	You can't take home the pinecones.
552.68	There are so many rules and restrictions
554.609	that from a child's point of view,
556.6	this is, like, the worst nature ever.
559.32	Because children don't want to hike
561.96	through a beautiful landscape
561.96	for five hours
564.32	and then look at a beautiful view.
566.2	That's maybe what we want to do as adults,
568.224	but what kids want to do
568.224	is hunker down in one spot
571.16	and just tinker with it,
571.16	just work with it,
573.4	just pick it up, build a house,
573.4	build a fort, do something like that.
578.16	Additionally, these sort of Edenic places
580.72	are often distant from where people live.
584	And they're expensive to get to.
584	They're hard to visit.
586.96	So this means that they're
586.96	only available to the elites,
589.76	and that's a real problem.
593	The Nature Conservancy
593	did a survey of young people,
596.4	and they asked them, how often
596.4	do you spend time outdoors?
600.12	And only two out of five
600.12	spent time outdoors
602.68	at least once a week.
603.92	The other three out of five
603.92	were just staying inside.
606.96	And when they asked them why,
606.96	what are the barriers to going outside,
611.08	the response of 61 percent was,
614.08	"""There are no natural areas near my home."""
618.2	And this is crazy.
618.2	This is just patently false.
621.92	I mean, 71 percent of people in the US
624.92	live within a 10-minute walk
624.92	of a city park.
627.72	And I'm sure the figures
627.72	are similar in other countries.
630.4	And that doesn't even count
630.4	your back garden,
632.56	the urban creek, the empty lot.
635.16	Everybody lives near nature.
637.08	Every kid lives near nature.
639.76	We've just somehow
639.76	forgotten how to see it.
641.84	We've spent too much time
641.84	watching David Attenborough documentaries
645.04	where the nature is really sexy --
646.72	(Laughter)
647.76	and we've forgotten how to see the nature
647.76	that is literally right outside our door,
651.72	the nature of the street tree.
653.68	So here's an example: Philadelphia.
656.48	There's this cool elevated railway
658.88	that you can see from the ground,
658.88	that's been abandoned.
661.32	Now, this may sound like the beginning
661.32	of the High Line story in Manhattan,
664.76	and it's very similar, except they haven't
664.76	developed this into a park yet,
668.08	although they're working on it.
669.64	So for now, it's still this little
669.64	sort of secret wilderness
672.84	in the heart of Philadelphia,
674.28	and if you know where the hole is
674.28	in the chain-link fence,
677.4	you can scramble up to the top
679.48	and you can find this
679.48	completely wild meadow
682.32	just floating above
682.32	the city of Philadelphia.
685.2	Every single one of these plants
685.2	grew from a seed
687.56	that planted itself there.
688.92	This is completely autonomous,
688.92	self-willed nature.
691.88	And it's right in the middle of the city.
694.16	And they've sent people up there
694.16	to do sort of biosurveys,
697.4	and there are over 50
697.4	plant species up there.
700.56	And it's not just plants.
701.84	This is an ecosystem,
701.84	a functioning ecosystem.
705.36	It's creating soil.
705.36	It's sequestering carbon.
707.84	There's pollination going on.
709.76	I mean, this is really an ecosystem.
713.4	So scientists have started calling
713.4	"ecosystems like these ""novel ecosystems,"""
717.28	because they're often
717.28	dominated by non-native species,
719.88	and because they're just super weird.
721.64	They're just unlike anything
721.64	we've ever seen before.
724.12	For so long, we dismissed
724.12	all these novel ecosystems as trash.
728.16	We're talking about
728.16	regrown agricultural fields,
730.6	timber plantations that are not
730.6	being managed on a day-to-day basis,
734.2	second-growth forests generally,
734.2	the entire East Coast,
736.88	where after agriculture moved west,
736.88	the forest sprung up.
741.04	And of course, pretty much all of Hawaii,
743.68	where novel ecosystems are the norm,
746.52	where exotic species totally dominate.
749.12	This forest here has Queensland maple,
751.56	it has sword ferns from Southeast Asia.
755.16	You can make your own
755.16	novel ecosystem, too.
757.24	It's really simple.
758.48	You just stop mowing your lawn.
760	(Laughter)
761.6	Ilkka Hanski was an ecologist in Finland,
761.6	and he did this experiment himself.
765.32	He just stopped mowing his lawn,
766.92	and after a few years,
766.92	he had some grad students come,
769.48	and they did sort of
769.48	a bio-blitz of his backyard,
772	and they found 375 plant species,
776.28	including two endangered species.
779.56	So when you're up there
779.56	on that future High Line of Philadelphia,
786.04	surrounded by this wildness,
787.88	surrounded by this diversity,
787.88	this abundance, this vibrance,
791.68	you can look over the side
792.96	and you can see a local playground
792.96	for a local school,
796.24	and that's what it looks like.
798.2	These children have, that --
800.24	You know, under my definition,
801.72	there's a lot of the planet
801.72	that counts as nature,
804.12	but this would be one of the few places
804.12	that wouldn't count as nature.
807.48	There's nothing there except humans,
807.48	no other plants, no other animals.
810.88	And what I really wanted to do
812.36	was just, like,
812.36	throw a ladder over the side
814.48	and get all these kids to come up with me
814.48	into this cool meadow.
818.04	In a way, I feel like this is
818.04	the choice that faces us.
821.36	If we dismiss these new natures
821.36	as not acceptable or trashy or no good,
827.04	we might as well just pave them over.
829.64	And in a world where
829.64	everything is changing,
832.2	we need to be very careful
832.2	about how we define nature.
835.8	In order not to steal it
835.8	from our children,
837.88	we have to do two things.
839.84	First, we cannot define nature
839.84	as that which is untouched.
844.36	This never made any sense anyway.
845.96	Nature has not been untouched
845.96	for thousands of years.
848.48	And it excludes most of the nature
848.48	that most people can visit
852.32	and have a relationship with,
854.32	including only nature
854.32	that children cannot touch.
858.36	Which brings me to the second thing
858.36	that we have to do,
861	which is that we have to
861	let children touch nature,
863.52	because that which
863.52	is untouched is unloved.
866.04	(Applause)
875.4	We face some pretty grim
875.4	environmental challenges on this planet.
879.16	Climate change is among them.
880.72	There's others too:
880.72	habitat loss is my favorite thing
883.24	to freak out about
883.24	in the middle of the night.
885.96	But in order to solve them,
887.32	we need people --
887.32	smart, dedicated people --
890.08	who care about nature.
891.88	And the only way we're going to raise up
891.88	a generation of people
894.88	who care about nature
896.12	is by letting them touch nature.
898.32	I have a Fort Theory of Ecology,
900.64	Fort Theory of Conservation.
902.56	Every ecologist I know,
902.56	every conservation biologist I know,
905.8	every conservation professional I know,
907.72	built forts when they were kids.
910.84	If we have a generation
910.84	that doesn't know how to build a fort,
913.8	we'll have a generation that doesn't
913.8	know how to care about nature.
917	And I don't want
917	to be the one to tell this kid,
919.28	who is on a special program
920.64	that takes Philadelphia kids
920.64	from poor neighborhoods
923.12	and takes them to city parks,
924.56	I don't want to be the one to tell him
924.56	that the flower he's holding
927.76	is a non-native invasive weed
927.76	that he should throw away as trash.
931.76	I think I would much rather
931.76	learn from this boy
934.96	that no matter
934.96	where this plant comes from,
937.64	it is beautiful, and it deserves
937.64	to be touched and appreciated.
941.84	Thank you.
