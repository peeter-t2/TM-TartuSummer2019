16.224	When I was 11,
17.664	I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house.
22.226	My father was listening to BBC News
24.697	on his small, gray radio.
28.871	There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then,
31.747	because the news mostly depressed him.
35.718	"""The Taliban are gone!"" my father shouted."
40.603	I didn't know what it meant,
43.191	but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
48.377	"""You can go to a real school now,"" he said."
56.888	A morning that I will never forget.
62.057	A real school.
67.225	You see, I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan
70.333	and made it illegal for girls to go to school.
73.856	So for the next five years, I dressed as a boy
76.964	to escort my older sister, who was no longer allowed
79.475	to be outside alone, to a secret school.
84.889	It was the only way we both could be educated.
89.514	Each day, we took a different route
92.748	so that no one would suspect where we were going.
96.771	We would cover our books in grocery bags
98.965	so it would seem we were just out shopping.
105.101	The school was in a house,
107.477	more than 100 of us packed in one small living room.
113.14	It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer.
118.99	We all knew we were risking our lives --
121.511	the teacher, the students and our parents.
125.865	From time to time, the school would suddenly be canceled
128.238	for a week because Taliban were suspicious.
132.154	We always wondered what they knew about us.
134.934	Were we being followed?
137.966	Do they know where we live?
141.498	We were scared,
144.156	but still, school was where we wanted to be.
151.082	I was very lucky to grow up in a family
154.822	where education was prized and daughters were treasured.
161.069	My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
166.22	A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan,
169.699	he insisted that his daughter, my mom,
173.195	go to school, and for that he was disowned by his father.
179.608	But my educated mother became a teacher.
183.118	There she is.
186.144	She retired two years ago, only to turn our house
188.811	into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
194.189	And my father -- that's him --
198.577	he was the first ever in his family to receive an education.
205.478	There was no question that his children
207.587	would receive an education, including his daughters,
212.676	despite the Taliban, despite the risks.
217.096	To him, there was greater risk in not educating his children.
225.442	During Taliban years, I remember
228.57	there were times I would get so frustrated by our life
233.663	and always being scared and not seeing a future.
237.615	I would want to quit,
240.669	but my father,
243.805	he would say,
246.314	"""Listen, my daughter,"
248.419	you can lose everything you own in your life.
251.735	Your money can be stolen. You can be forced to leave your home during a war.
255.94	But the one thing that will always remain with you
258.721	is what is here,
262.029	and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees,
266.945	we will.
270.166	"So do you still not want to continue?"""
275.248	Today I am 22.
278.376	I was raised in a country that has been destroyed
281.146	by decades of war.
284.316	Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school,
289.457	and had my family not been so committed to my education,
291.922	I would be one of them.
294.526	Instead, I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College.
299.841	(Applause)
309.854	When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather,
312.802	the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters,
317.381	was among the first to congratulate me.
320.875	He not only brags about my college degree,
323.505	but also that I was the first woman,
325.714	and that I am the first woman
327.436	to drive him through the streets of Kabul.
330.938	(Applause)
336.3	My family believes in me.
338.949	I dream big, but my family dreams even bigger for me.
343.899	That's why I am a global ambassador for 10x10,
348.366	a global campaign to educate women.
351.13	That's why I cofounded SOLA,
353.709	the first and perhaps only boarding school
356.176	for girls in Afghanistan,
357.905	a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
363.542	The exciting thing is that I see students at my school
367.307	with ambition grabbing at opportunity.
372.935	And I see their parents and their fathers
375.862	who, like my own, advocate for them,
380.44	despite and even in the face of daunting opposition.
389.372	Like Ahmed. That's not his real name,
392.078	and I cannot show you his face,
394.706	but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
398.351	Less than a month ago, he and his daughter
402.187	were on their way from SOLA to their village,
405.521	and they literally missed being killed
412.014	by a roadside bomb by minutes.
416.796	As he arrived home, the phone rang,
420.199	a voice warning him
422.894	that if he sent his daughter back to school,
426.289	they would try again.
429.066	"""Kill me now, if you wish,"" he said,"
432.968	"""but I will not ruin my daughter's future"
436.862	"because of your old and backward ideas."""
441.694	What I've come to realize about Afghanistan,
444.063	and this is something that is often dismissed in the West,
447.583	that behind most of us who succeed
450.806	is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter
458.169	and who sees that her success is his success.
462.796	It's not to say that our mothers aren't key in our success.
466.734	In fact, they're often the initial and convincing negotiators
471.27	of a bright future for their daughters,
474.61	but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan,
478.021	we must have the support of men.
481.441	Under the Taliban, girls who went to school
484.991	numbered in the hundreds --
486.783	remember, it was illegal.
489.121	But today, more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan.
494.613	(Applause)
501.86	Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
508.011	I find that Americans see the fragility in changes.
512.983	I fear that these changes will not last
516.033	much beyond the U.S. troops' withdrawal.
520.525	But when I am back in Afghanistan,
524.178	when I see the students in my school
528.963	and their parents who advocate for them,
531.603	who encourage them, I see a promising future
536.07	and lasting change.
539.37	To me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities,
547.837	and every single day
551.249	the girls of SOLA remind me of that.
554.657	Like me, they are dreaming big.
557.864	Thank you.
559.575	(Applause)
