12.492	The entire model of capitalism
15.924	and the economic model that you and I
18.103	did business in,
19.782	and, in fact, continue to do business in,
21.609	was built around what probably Milton Friedman
25.232	put more succinctly.
26.95	And Adam Smith, of course, 
26.95	the father of modern economics
29.53	actually said many, many years ago,
31.879	the invisible hand,
33.397	"which is, ""If you continue to operate"
35.053	in your own self-interest
37.166	"you will do the best good for society."""
39.922	Now, capitalism has done a lot of good things
44.653	and I've talked about a lot of good 
44.653	things that have happened,
47.455	but equally, it has not been able to meet up
50.841	with some of the challenges that we've seen
52.777	in society.
54.438	The model that at least I was brought up in
56.652	and a lot of us doing
56.652	business were brought up in
58.932	was one which talked about
60.641	what I call the three G's of growth:
63.069	growth that is consistent,
64.658	quarter on quarter;
66.184	growth that is competitive,
67.622	better than the other person;
68.952	and growth that is profitable,
70.514	so you continue to make
72.003	more and more shareholder value.
74.922	And I'm afraid this is not going to be good enough
77.714	and we have to move from this 3G model
80.374	to a model of what I call
82.688	the fourth G:
84.234	the G of growth that is responsible.
88.123	And it is this that has to become
91.56	a very important part
93.8	of creating value.
95.675	Of not just creating economic value
98.4	but creating social value.
100.854	And companies that will thrive are those
103.654	that will actually embrace the fourth G.
107.019	And the model of 4G is quite simple:
110.044	Companies cannot afford 
110.044	to be just innocent bystanders
113.816	in what's happening around in society.
116.151	They have to begin to play their role
119.718	in terms of serving the communities
121.878	which actually sustain them.
123.976	And we have to move to a model
125.673	of an and/and model which is
127.766	how do we make money and do good?
131.248	How do we make sure
133.056	that we have a great business
134.636	but we also have a great environment around us?
137.508	And that model
138.828	is all about doing well and doing good.
141.797	But the question is easier said than done.
144.118	But how do we actually get that done?
146.255	And I do believe
147.601	that the answer to that is going to be leadership.
150.691	It is going to be to redefine
152.048	the new business models
153.918	which understand
155.264	that the only license to operate
157.269	is to combine these things.
159.406	And for that you need businesses
161.338	that can actually define their role
164.097	in society
166.182	in terms of a much larger purpose
167.826	than the products and brands that they sell.
170.657	And companies that actually define a true north,
173.89	things that are nonnegotiable
175.636	whether times are good, bad, ugly --
178.196	doesn't matter.
179.463	There are things that you stand for.
181.629	Values and purpose are going to be the two
186.121	drivers of software
188.256	that are going to create
189.968	the companies of tomorrow.
192.034	And I'm going to now shift
193.44	to talking a little bit about my own experiences.
197.458	I joined Unilever in 1976
200.338	as a management trainee in India.
203.471	And on my first day of work
205.806	I walked in and my boss tells me,
208.14	"""Do you know why you're here?"""
210.247	"I said, ""I'm here to sell a lot of soap."""
213.544	And he said, 
213.544	"""No, you're here to change lives."""
216.63	You're here to change lives.
218.922	You know, I thought it was rather facetious.
220.552	We are a company that sells soap and soup.
223.367	What are we doing about changing lives?
226.239	And it's then I realized
230.254	that simple acts
232.577	like selling a bar of soap
235.009	can save more lives
236.498	than pharmaceutical companies.
237.975	I don't know how many of you know
239.597	that five million children don't reach the age of five
242.932	because of simple infections that can be prevented
245.808	by an act of washing their hands with soap.
248.748	We run the largest
250.2	hand-washing program
251.429	in the world.
252.334	We are running a program on hygiene and health
254.495	that now touches half a billion people.
256.997	It's not about selling soap,
258.597	there is a larger purpose out there.
260.558	And brands indeed can be
262.616	at the forefront of social change.
264.623	And the reason for that is,
266.28	when two billion people use your brands
268.89	that's the amplifier.
270.542	Small actions can make a big difference.
273.743	Take another example,
275.281	I was walking around in 
275.281	one of our villages in India.
278.551	Now those of you who have done this
280.194	will realize that this is no walk in the park.
285.368	And we had this lady
287.943	who was one of our small distributors --
292.083	beautiful, very, very modest, her home --
295.695	and she was out there,
298.103	dressed nicely,
299.655	her husband in the back, her mother-in-law behind
301.815	and her sister-in-law behind her.
304.041	The social order was changing
306.113	because this lady
307.863	is part of our Project Shakti
309.999	that is actually teaching women
312.283	how to do small business
314.154	and how to carry the message
315.333	of nutrition and hygiene.
317.976	We have 60,000 such women
320.183	now in India.
322.035	It's not about selling soap,
324.488	it's about making sure
325.941	that in the process of doing so
327.981	you can change people's lives.
330.174	Small actions, big difference.
333.371	Our R&amp;D folks
335.09	are not only working to give us 
335.09	some fantastic detergents,
338.719	but they're working to make sure we use less water.
341.488	A product that we've just launched recently,
343.652	One Rinse product that allows you to save water
347.18	every time you wash your clothes.
349.356	And if we can convert all our users to using this,
352.381	that's 500 billion liters of water.
354.614	By the way, that's equivalent to one month of water
356.908	for a whole huge continent.
360.092	So just think about it.
361.768	There are small actions that 
361.768	can make a big difference.
365.335	And I can go on and on.
366.953	Our food chain, our brilliant products --
369.05	and I'm sorry I'm giving you 
369.05	a word from the sponsors --
371.419	Knorr, Hellman's and all those wonderful products.
375.121	We are committed to making sure that
377.181	all our agricultural raw materials
379.138	are sourced from sustainable sources,
384.044	We were the first
385.592	to say we are going to buy all of our palm oil
387.801	from sustainable sources.
389.763	I don't know how many of you know that palm oil,
393.683	and not buying it from sustainable sources,
396.096	can create deforestation that is responsible
398.701	for 20 percent of the greenhouse gasses in the world.
401.243	We were the first to embrace that,
403.759	and it's all because we market soap and soup.
408.157	And the point I'm making here
410.355	is that companies like yours, companies like mine
413.878	have to define a purpose
416.001	which embraces responsibility
418.282	and understands that we have to play our part
420.982	in the communities in which we operate.
423.819	We introduced something called
425.719	The Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, which said,
428.463	"""Our purpose is to make "
428.463	sustainable living commonplace,
431.349	and we are gong to change the lives
433.176	"of one billion people over 2020."""
435.901	Now the question here is,
437.701	where do we go from here?
439.225	And the answer to that is very simple:
441.145	We're not going to change the world alone.
443.278	There are plenty of you and plenty of us
445.868	who understand this.
447.338	The question is,
448.503	we need partnerships, we need coalitions
451.134	and importantly, we need that leadership
453.59	that will allow us to take this from here
456.55	and to be the change
457.839	that we want to see around us.
459.375	Thank you very much.
460.695	(Applause)
