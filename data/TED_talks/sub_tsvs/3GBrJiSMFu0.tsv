15.26	I was informed by this kind of
18.26	unoriginal and trite idea
20.26	that new technologies were an opportunity
22.26	for social transformation,
24.26	which is what drove me then,
26.26	and still, it's a delusion that drives me now.
28.26	I wanted to update what I've been doing since then --
31.26	but it's still the same theme song --
34.26	and introduce you to my lab and current work,
37.26	which is the Environmental Health Clinic
39.26	that I run at NYU.
41.26	And what it is -- it's a twist on health.
43.26	Because, really, what I'm trying to do now
45.26	is redefine what counts as health.
47.26	It's a clinic like a health clinic at any other university,
50.26	except people come to the clinic
52.26	with environmental health concerns,
54.26	and they walk out with prescriptions
56.26	for things they can do to improve environmental health,
59.26	as opposed to coming to a clinic with medical concerns
62.26	and walking out with prescriptions for pharmaceuticals.
65.26	It's a handy-dandy quote from Hippocrates of the Hippocratic oath
68.26	"that says, ""The greater part of the soul lays outside the body,"
71.26	"treatment of the inner requires treatment of the outer."""
73.26	But that suggests the issue
75.26	that I'm trying to get at here,
77.26	that we have an opportunity to redefine what is health.
80.26	Because this idea that health is internal
82.26	and atomized and individual
85.26	and pharmaceutical
87.26	is largely an error.
89.26	And I would use this study,
91.26	a recent study by Philip Landrigan,
93.26	to motivate a different view of health,
95.26	where he went to most of the pediatricians in Manhattan
98.26	and the New York area
100.26	and logged what they spent their patient hours on.
105.26	was spent on five things.
107.26	Number one was asthma,
109.26	number two was developmental delays,
112.26	number three was 400-fold increases
114.26	in rare childhood cancers
116.26	in the last eight to 10, 15 years.
119.26	Number four and five were childhood obesity
122.26	and diabetes-related issues.
125.26	So all of those -- what's common about all of those?
128.26	The environment is implicated, radically implicated, right.
131.26	This is not the germs
133.26	that medicos were trained to deal with;
136.26	this is a different definition of health,
139.26	health that has a great advantage
142.26	because it's external, it's shared,
144.26	we can do something about it,
146.26	as opposed to internal, genetically predetermined
149.26	or individualized.
151.26	People who come to the clinic are called, not patients,
153.26	but impatients,
155.26	because they're too impatient to wait for legislative change
158.26	to address local and environmental health issues.
161.26	And I meet them at the University, I also have a few field offices
164.26	that I set up in various places
166.26	that provide an immersion
168.26	in some of the environmental challenges we face.
170.26	I like this one from the Belgian field office,
173.26	where we met in a roundabout,
175.26	precisely because the roundabout iconified
177.26	the headless social movement
179.26	that informs much social transformation,
182.26	as opposed to the top-down control
184.26	of red light traffic intersections.
187.26	In this case, of course, the roundabout
190.26	with that micro-decisions being made in situ
192.26	by people not being told what to do.
195.26	But, of course, affords greater throughput,
197.26	fewer accidents,
199.26	and an interesting model of social movement.
202.26	Some of the things that the monitoring protocols have developed:
204.26	this is the tadpole bureaucrat protocol,
207.26	or keeping tabs, if you will.
210.26	What they are is an addition of tadpoles
212.26	that are named after a local bureaucrat
214.26	whose decisions affect your water quality.
217.26	So an impatient concerned for water quality
220.26	would raise a tadpole bureaucrat
223.26	in a sample of water in which they're interested.
226.26	And we give them a couple of things to do that,
228.26	to help them do companion animal devices
230.26	while they're blogging and doing their email.
232.26	This is a tadpole walker
234.26	to take your tadpole walking in the evening.
237.26	And the interesting thing that happens --
239.26	because we're using tadpoles, of course,
241.26	because they have the most exquisite biosenses that we have,
244.26	several orders of magnitude more sensitive
246.26	than some of our senses
248.26	for sensing,
251.26	responding in a biologically meaningful way,
253.26	to that whole class of industrial contaminants
255.26	we call endocrine disruptors
257.26	or hormone emulators.
259.26	But by taking your tadpole out for a walk in the evening --
262.26	there's a few action shots --
264.26	"your neighbors are likely to say, ""What are you doing?"""
267.26	And then you have to introduce your tadpole
270.26	and who it's named after.
272.26	You have to explain what you're doing
274.26	and how the developmental events of a tadpole
276.26	are, of course, very observable
278.26	and they use the same T3-mediated hormones that we do.
283.26	And so next time your neighbor sees you
286.26	"they'll say, ""How is that tadpole doing?"""
289.26	And you can let them social network with your tadpole,
292.26	because the Environmental Health Clinic has a social networking site
295.26	for, not only impatients, humans,
298.26	but non-humans,
300.26	social networking for humans and non-humans.
302.26	And of course, these endocrine disruptors
304.26	are things that are implicated in the breast cancer epidemic,
307.26	the obesity epidemic,
309.26	the two and a half year drop in the average age of onset of puberty in young girls
312.26	and other related things.
314.26	The culmination of this is if you've successfully raised your tadpole,
317.26	observing the behavioral
319.26	and developmental events,
321.26	you will then go and introduce your tadpole
323.26	to its namesake
325.26	and discuss the evidence that you've seen.
328.26	Another quick protocol -- and I'm going to go through these quickly,
331.26	but just to give you the material sense of what we're doing here --
334.26	instead of asking you for urine samples,
336.26	I'll ask you for a mouse sample.
338.26	Anyone here lucky enough to share, to cohabit with a mouse --
341.26	a domestic partnership with mice?
343.26	Very lucky.
346.26	Mice, of course, are the quintessential
349.26	model organism.
351.26	They're even better models of environmental health,
353.26	because not only the same mammalian biology,
355.26	but they share your diet, largely.
357.26	They share your environmental stressors,
360.26	the asbestos levels and lead levels,
362.26	whatever you're exposed to.
364.26	And they're geographically more limited than you are,
366.26	because we don't know if you've been exposed
368.26	to persistent organic pollutants
370.26	in your home, or occupationally
372.26	or as a child.
374.26	Mice are a very good representation.
376.26	So it starts by building a better mousetrap, of course.
379.26	This is one of them.
381.26	Coping with environmental stressors is tricky.
383.26	Is anybody here on antidepressants?
386.26	(Laughter)
388.26	There's a lot of people in Manhattan are.
391.26	And we were testing if the mice
393.26	would also self-administer SSRIs.
396.26	So this was Prozac, this was Zoloft,
398.26	this was a black jellybean and this was muscle relaxant,
401.26	all of which were the medications that the impatient was taking.
404.26	So do you think the mice
406.26	self-administered antidepressants?
408.26	What's the -- (Audience: Sure. Yes.)
411.26	How did you know that? They did.
414.26	This was vodka and solution, gin and solution.
416.26	This guy also liked plain water and the muscle relaxant.
419.26	Where's our expert?
421.26	Vodka, gin --
423.26	(Audience: [unclear])
425.26	Yes. Yes. You know your mice well.
428.26	They did, yes.
430.26	So they drank as much vodka as they did plain water,
432.26	which was interesting.
434.26	Then of course, it goes into the entrapment device.
437.26	There's an old cellphone in there -- a good use for old cellphones --
439.26	which dials the clinic, we go and pick up the mouse.
442.26	We take the blood sample
444.26	and do the blood work and hair work on the mice.
446.26	And I want to sort of point out the big advantage
448.26	of framing health in this external way.
451.26	But we do have a few prescription products through this.
454.26	It's very different from the medical model.
457.26	Anything you do to improve your water quality or air quality,
460.26	or to understand it or to change it,
463.26	the benefits are enjoyed by anyone
465.26	you share that water quality or air quality with.
468.26	And that aggregating effect,
470.26	that collective action effect,
473.26	is actually something we can use to our advantage.
476.26	So I want to show you one prescription product in the clinic
479.26	called the No Park.
481.26	This is a prescription to improve water quality.
484.26	Many impatients are very concerned for water quality and air quality.
487.26	What we do is we take a fire hydrant,
489.26	"a ""no parking"" space associated with a fire hydrant,"
492.26	and we prescribe the removal of the asphalt
495.26	to create an engineered micro landscape,
497.26	to create an infiltration opportunity.
499.26	Because, many of you will know,
501.26	that the biggest pollution burden
503.26	that we have on the New York, New Jersey harbor right now
505.26	is no longer the point sources,
507.26	no longer the big polluters,
509.26	no longer the GEs,
511.26	but that massive network of roads,
513.26	[those] impervious surfaces,
515.26	that collect all that cadmium neurotoxin that comes from your brake liners
518.26	or the oily hydrocarbon waste
520.26	in every single storm event and medieval infrastructure
523.26	washes it straight into the estuary system.
525.26	That doesn't do a lot of good.
527.26	These are little opportunities to intercept those pollutants
530.26	before they enter the harbor,
532.26	and they're produced by impatients
534.26	on various city blocks
536.26	in some very interesting ways.
538.26	I just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though,
540.26	there's about two or three fire hydrants
543.26	on every city block.
545.26	By creating engineered micro landscapes to infiltrate in them,
548.26	we don't prevent them from being used
550.26	as emergency vehicle parking spaces,
552.26	because, of course, a firetruck can come and park there.
555.26	They flatten a few plants. No big deal, they'll regenerate.
559.26	But if we did this
561.26	in every single --
564.26	every fire hydrant
566.26	we could redefine the emergency.
569.26	That 99 percent of the time
571.26	when a firetruck is not parking there,
574.26	it's infiltrating pollutants.
576.26	It's also increasing fixing CO2s,
579.26	sequestering some of the airborne pollutants.
582.26	And aggregated,
584.26	these smaller interceptions
586.26	could actually infiltrate all the roadborne pollution
589.26	that now runs into the estuary system,
591.26	up to a seven inch rain event, up to a hundred-year storm.
594.26	So these are small actions
596.26	that can amount to a significant effect
598.26	to improve local environmental health.
601.26	This is one of the more ambitious ones.
603.26	What the climate crisis has revealed to us
606.26	is a secondary, more insidious
608.26	and more pervasive crisis,
611.26	which is the crisis of agency,
614.26	which is what to do.
617.26	Somehow buying a local lettuce, changing a light bulb,
620.26	driving the speed limit, changing your tires regularly,
622.26	doesn't seem sufficient
624.26	in the face of climate crisis.
627.26	And this is an interesting icon that happened --
629.26	you remember these: fallout shelters.
632.26	What is the fallout shelter
634.26	for the climate crisis?
636.26	This was civic mobilization.
638.26	Churches, school groups,
640.26	hospitals, private residents --
642.26	everyone built one of these in a matter of months.
644.26	And they still remain
646.26	as icons of civic response
649.26	in the face of shared, uncertain, collective threat.
651.26	Fallout shelter for the climate crisis,
653.26	I would say, looks something like this, or this,
656.26	which is an intensive urban agriculture facility
658.26	that's due to go on my lab building at NYU.
661.26	What it does
663.26	is a very simple idea
665.26	of taking --
670.26	is building related --
672.26	we take, just like a commercial greenhouse,
674.26	we take the CO2 from the building --
676.26	CO2-enriched air --
678.26	we force it through the urban agriculture facility,
681.26	and then we resupply oxygen-enriched air.
683.26	You can't actually build much on a roof, they're not designed for that.
686.26	So it's on legs,
688.26	so it focuses all the load on the masonry walls and the columns.
691.26	It's built as a barn raising,
693.26	using open source hardware.
695.26	This is the quarter-scale prototype
697.26	that was functioning in Spain.
699.26	This is what it will look like, fingers crossed,
701.26	NYU willing.
703.26	And what I want to show you is --
705.26	actually this is one of the components of it that we've just recently been testing --
708.26	which is a solar chimney --
710.26	we have got 17 of them now put around New York at the moment --
712.26	that passively draws air up.
714.26	You understand a solar chimney.
716.26	Hot air rises.
718.26	You put a bit of black plastic on the side of a building,
720.26	it'll heat up, and you'll get passive airflow.
723.26	What we do is actually
725.26	put a standard HVAC filter on the top of that.
728.26	That actually removes about 95 percent
730.26	of the carbon black,
732.26	that stuff that, with ozone,
734.26	is responsible for about half of global warming's effects,
736.26	because it changes, it settles on the snow,
738.26	it changes the reflectors,
740.26	it changes
742.26	the transmission qualities of the atmosphere.
745.26	Carbon black is that grime
747.26	that otherwise lodges in your pretty pink lungs,
749.26	and it's associated with.
751.26	It's not good stuff, and it's from inefficient combustion,
754.26	not from combustion itself.
756.26	When we put it through our solar chimney,
759.26	we remove actually about 95 percent of that.
762.26	And then I swap it out
765.26	with the students
767.26	and actually re-release that carbon black.
769.26	And we make pencils the length of which measures the grime
772.26	that we've pulled out of the air.
774.26	Here's one of them that we have up now.
776.26	Here's who put them up and who are avid pencil users.
779.26	Okay, so I want to show you
781.26	just two more interfaces,
783.26	because I think one of our big challenges
785.26	is re-imagining our relationship to natural systems,
788.26	not only through this model
791.26	of twisted personalized health,
794.26	but through the animals
796.26	with whom we cohabit.
798.26	We are not alone; the animals are moving in.
800.26	In fact, urban migration now describes
802.26	the movement of animals formerly known as wild
805.26	into urban centers.
807.26	You know, coyote in Central Park, a whale in the Gowanus Canal,
809.26	elk in Westchester County.
811.26	It's happening all over the Developed World,
813.26	probably for loss of habitat,
815.26	but also because our cities are a little bit more livable
817.26	than they have been.
819.26	And every green space we create
821.26	is an invitation for non-humans to cohabit with us.
823.26	But we've kind of lacked imagination
825.26	in how we could do that well or interestingly.
828.26	And I want to show you a few of the technological interfaces
830.26	that have been developed under the moniker of OOZ --
833.26	which is zoo backwards and without cages --
836.26	to try and reform
838.26	that relationship.
840.26	This is communication technology for birds. It looks like this.
843.26	When a bird lands on it, they trigger a sound file.
846.26	This is actually in the Whitney Museum, where there were six of them,
849.26	each of which had a different argument on it,
851.26	different sound file.
853.26	They said things like this.
855.26	(Whistling)
857.26	Recorded Voice: Here's what you need to do.
860.26	Go down there and buy some of those health food bars,
863.26	the ones you call bird food,
865.26	and bring it here and scatter it around.
867.26	There's a good person.
870.26	Natalie Jeremijenko: Okay. (Laugher)
873.26	So there was several of these.
875.26	The birds were able to jump from one to the other.
877.26	These are just your average urban pigeon.
880.26	And an early test
882.26	which argument elicited cooperative behavior
884.26	from the people below --
887.26	about a hundred to one
889.26	decided that this was the argument
891.26	that worked best on us.
893.26	Recorded Voice: Tick, tick, tick.
896.26	That's the sound of genetic mutations
898.26	of the avian flu
900.26	becoming a deadly human flu.
902.26	Do you know what slows it down?
904.26	Healthy sub-populations of birds,
906.26	increasing biodiversity generally.
909.26	It is in your interests that I'm healthy,
912.26	happy, well-fed.
914.26	Hence, you could share some of your nutritional resources
917.26	instead of monopolizing them.
919.26	That is, share your lunch.
922.26	(Laughter)
924.26	NJ: It worked, and it's true.
927.26	The final project I'd like to show you
929.26	is a new interface for fish
931.26	that has just been launched --
933.26	it's actually officially launched next week --
935.26	with a wonderful commission from the Architectural League.
937.26	You may not have known that you need to communicate with fish,
940.26	but there is now a device for you to do so.
942.26	It looks like this: buoys that float on the water,
945.26	project three foot up, three foot down.
947.26	When a fish swims underneath, a light goes on.
950.26	This is what it looks like.
957.26	So there's another function on here.
960.26	This top light is -- I'm sorry if I'm making you seasick --
964.26	this top light is actually a water quality display
966.26	that shifts from red, when the dissolved oxygen is low,
969.26	to a blue/green, when its dissolved oxygen is high.
972.26	And then you can also text the fish.
975.26	So there's business cards down there
977.26	that'll give you contact details.
979.26	And they text back.
981.26	When the buoys get your text, they wink at you twice to say, we've got your message.
984.26	But perhaps the most popular has been
986.26	that we've got another array of these boys in the Bronx River,
988.26	where the first beaver --
990.26	crazy as he is --
992.26	to have moved in and built a lodge in New York
994.26	in 250 years, hangs out.
997.26	So updates from a beaver.
999.26	You can subscribe to updates from him. You can talk to him.
1002.26	And what I like to think of
1005.26	is this is an interface
1008.26	that re-scripts how we interact with natural systems,
1011.26	specifically by changing who has information,
1014.26	where they have it,
1016.26	who can make sense of that information,
1018.26	and what you can do about it.
1020.26	In this case, instead of throwing chewing gum,
1023.26	or Doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish --
1026.26	There's a body of water in Iceland that I've been dealing with
1028.26	that's in the middle of the city,
1030.26	and the largest pollution burden on it
1032.26	is not the roadborne pollution,
1034.26	it's actually white bread
1036.26	from people feeding the fish and the birds.
1038.26	Instead of doing that actually, we've developed some fish sticks
1040.26	that you can feed the fish.
1043.26	They're delicious.
1045.26	They're cross-species delicious that is,
1048.26	delicious for humans and non-humans.
1050.26	But they also have a chelating agent in them.
1052.26	They're nutritionally appropriate,
1054.26	not like Doritos.
1056.26	And so every time
1059.26	that desire to interact with the animals,
1062.26	which is at least as ubiquitous
1066.26	"as that sign: ""Do not feed the animals."""
1068.26	And there's about three of them on every New York City park.
1071.26	And Yellowstone National Park,
1073.26	"there's more ""do not feed the animals"" signs"
1075.26	than there are animals you might wish to feed.
1078.26	But in that action, that interaction,
1081.26	by re-scripting that,
1083.26	by changing it into an opportunity
1085.26	to offer food that is nutritionally appropriate,
1088.26	that could augment the nutritional resources
1090.26	that we ourselves have depleted
1092.26	for augmenting the fish population
1094.26	and also adding chelating agent,
1096.26	which, like any chelating agent that we use medicinally,
1100.26	binds to the bioaccumulated heavy metals and PCBs
1103.26	that are in the fish
1105.26	living in this particular habitat
1108.26	and allows them to pass it out as a harmless salt
1110.26	where it's complexed by a reactive,
1113.26	effectively removing it from bioavailability.
1116.26	But I wanted to say that interaction,
1118.26	re-scripting that interaction,
1120.26	into collective action, collective remediative action,
1123.26	very different from the approach
1126.26	that's being used on the other side on the Hudson River,
1129.26	where we're dredging the PCBs --
1132.26	after 30 years of legislative and legal struggle,
1136.26	GE's paying for the dredging
1138.26	of the largest Superfund site in the world --
1141.26	we're dredging it, and it'll probably get shipped off to Pennsylvania
1144.26	or the nearest Third World country,
1146.26	where it will continue to be toxic sludge.
1150.26	Displacement is not the way to deal with environmental issues.
1154.26	And that's typically the paradigm
1156.26	under which we've operated.
1158.26	By actually taking the opportunity
1160.26	that new technologies,
1162.26	new interactive technologies, present
1164.26	to re-script our interactions,
1166.26	to script them,
1168.26	not just as isolated, individuated interactions,
1171.26	but as collective aggregating actions
1175.26	that can amount to something,
1177.26	we can really begin to address
1179.26	some of our important environmental challenges.
1181.26	Thank you.
