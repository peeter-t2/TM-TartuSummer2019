12.621	I am from the South Side of Chicago,
15.46	and in seventh grade,
15.46	I had a best friend named Jenny
19.58	who lived on the Southwest
19.58	Side of Chicago.
23.18	Jenny was white,
25.18	and if you know anything about
25.18	the segregated demographics of Chicago,
29.18	you know that there are
29.18	not too many black people
32.34	who live on the Southwest Side of Chicago.
34.42	But Jenny was my girl
35.7	and so we would hang out every so often
35.7	after school and on the weekends.
40.62	And so one day we were
40.62	hanging out in her living room,
43.939	talking about 13-year-old things,
47.22	and Jenny's little sister Rosie
47.22	was in the room with us,
50.46	and she was sitting behind me
50.46	just kind of playing in my hair,
53.54	and I wasn't thinking too much
53.54	about what she was doing.
58.22	But at a pause in the conversation,
60.46	Rosie tapped me on the shoulder.
62.98	"She said, ""Can I ask you a question?"""
65.94	"I said, ""Yeah, Rosie. Sure."""
68.62	"""Are you black?"""
70.06	(Laughter)
72.3	The room froze.
74.22	Silence.
76.699	Jenny and Rosie's mom
76.699	was not too far away.
78.98	She was in the kitchen
78.98	and she overheard the conversation,
81.9	and she was mortified.
84.14	"She said, ""Rosie! You can't"
84.14	"ask people questions like that."""
88.46	And Jenny was my friend,
88.46	and I know she was really embarrassed.
92.06	I felt kind of bad for her,
92.06	but actually I was not offended.
96.42	I figured it wasn't Rosie's fault
96.42	that in her 10 short years on this earth,
101.5	living on the Southwest Side of Chicago,
103.98	she wasn't 100 percent sure
103.98	what a black person looked like.
107.26	That's fair.
108.7	But what was more surprising to me was,
111.1	in all of this time I had spent
111.1	with Jenny and Rosie's family --
115.62	hanging out with them,
116.98	playing with them,
118.26	even physically interacting with them --
121.06	it was not until Rosie
121.06	put her hands in my hair
125.58	that she thought to ask me if I was black.
129.38	That was the first time I would realize
132.1	how big of a role the texture of my hair
132.1	played in confirming my ethnicity,
137.06	but also that it would play a key role
137.06	in how I'm viewed by others in society.
143.22	Garrett A. Morgan
143.22	and Madame CJ Walker were pioneers
146.46	of the black hair-care and beauty
146.46	industry in the early 1900s.
150.5	They're best known as the inventors
150.5	of chemically-based hair creams
154.3	and heat straightening tools
155.86	designed to permanently,
155.86	or semipermanently,
159.46	alter the texture of black hair.
163.18	Oftentimes when we think
163.18	about the history of blacks in America,
166.98	we think about the heinous acts
169.9	and numerous injustices
169.9	that we experienced as people of color
174.42	because of the color of our skin,
176.18	when in fact, in post-Civil War America,
179.86	it was the hair of an
179.86	African-American male or female
185.06	that was known as the most
185.06	"""telling feature"" of Negro status,"
189.94	more so than the color of the skin.
192.94	And so before they were staples
195.3	of the multibillion-dollar
195.3	hair-care industry,
199.26	our dependency on tools and products,
202.06	like the hair relaxer
202.06	and the pressing comb,
205.38	were more about our survival
205.38	and advancement as a race
209.82	in postslavery America.
213.7	Over the years,
213.7	we grew accustomed to this idea
217.1	that straighter and longer
217.1	hair meant better and more beautiful.
223.62	We became culturally obsessed
226.78	with this idea of having
226.78	what we like to call ...
230.66	"""good hair."""
233.5	This essentially means:
235.1	the looser the curl pattern,
235.1	the better the hair.
239.54	And we let these institutionalized ideas
239.54	form a false sense of hierarchy
246.02	that would determine
246.02	what was considered a good grade of hair
251.62	and what was not.
255.14	What's worse is that
255.14	we let these false ideologies
258.46	invade our perception of ourselves,
261.22	and they still continue
261.22	to infect our cultural identity
264.58	as African-American women today.
268.54	So what did we do?
270.06	We went to the hair salon
270.06	every six to eight weeks,
274.1	without fail,
275.5	to subject our scalps
275.5	to harsh straightening chemicals
278.86	beginning at a very young age --
280.82	sometimes eight, 10 --
282.9	that would result in hair loss,
286.14	bald spots,
287.38	sometimes even burns on the scalp.
290.26	We fry our hair at temperatures
290.26	of 450 degrees Fahrenheit or higher
295.06	almost daily,
296.34	to maintain the straight look.
299.26	Or we simply cover our hair up
299.26	with wigs and weaves,
304.18	only to let our roots breathe in private
306.86	where no one knows
306.86	what's really going on under there.
311.34	We adopted these practices
311.34	in our own communities,
314.66	and so it's no wonder
314.66	why today the typical ideal vision
320.02	of a professional black woman,
322.78	especially in corporate America,
324.7	tends to look like this,
328.14	rather than like this.
330.98	And she certainly doesn't look like this.
335.14	In September of this year,
337.14	a federal court ruled it lawful
339.66	for a company to discriminate
339.66	against hiring an employee
344.02	based on if she or he wears dreadlocks.
348.38	In the case,
349.62	the hiring manager in Mobile, Alabama
351.9	is on record as saying,
354.78	"""I'm not saying yours are messy,"
357.46	but ...
358.82	"you know what I'm talking about."""
362.26	Well, what was she talking about?
365.58	Did she think that they were ugly?
368.74	Or maybe they were
368.74	just a little too Afrocentric
373.22	and pro-black-looking for her taste.
376.3	Or maybe it's not about Afrocentricity,
378.26	and it's more just about
378.26	"it being a little too ""urban"""
380.82	for the professional setting.
383.7	Perhaps she had a genuine concern
383.7	"in that they looked ""scary"""
387.38	and that they would intimidate
387.38	the clients and their customer base.
392.5	All of these words are ones
392.5	that are too often associated
397.62	with the stigma
397.62	attached to natural hairstyles.
401.82	And this ...
403.54	this has got to change.
407.1	In 2013,
408.38	a white paper published by the Deloitte
408.38	Leadership Center for Inclusion,
412.9	studied 3,000 individuals
412.9	in executive leadership roles
416.34	on the concept
416.34	of covering in the workplace
418.98	based on appearance,
418.98	advocacy, affiliation and association.
424.14	When thinking about
424.14	appearance-based covering,
427.22	the study showed
428.5	that 67 percent of women
428.5	of color cover in the workplace
434.58	based on their appearance.
437.18	Of the total respondents who
437.18	admitted to appearance-based covering,
	somewhat to extremely important
445.94	for them to do so
445.94	for their professional advancement.
449.62	Now, this is Ursula Burns.
452.94	She is the first African-American
452.94	female CEO of a Fortune 500 company --
458.5	of Xerox.
460.18	She's known by her signature look,
462.26	the one that you see here.
463.98	A short, nicely trimmed,
463.98	well-manicured Afro.
469.18	Ms. Burns is what
469.18	"we like to call a ""natural girl."""
473.22	And she is paving the way
473.22	and showing what's possible
476.46	for African-American women
476.46	seeking to climb the corporate ladder,
480.22	but still wishing
480.22	to wear natural hairstyles.
483.74	But today the majority
483.74	of African-American women
487.82	who we still look to as leaders,
487.82	icons and role models,
492.54	still opt for a straight-hair look.
495.86	Now,
497.1	maybe it's because they want to --
498.82	this is authentically
498.82	how they feel best --
502.14	but maybe --
503.66	and I bet --
505.3	a part of them felt like they had to
508.58	in order to reach the level of success
508.58	that they have attained today.
514.26	There is a natural hair movement
514.26	that is sweeping the country
519.38	and also in some places in Europe.
522.58	Millions of women are exploring what
522.58	it means to transition to natural hair,
527.7	and they're cutting off
527.7	years and years of dry, damaged ends
531.739	in order to restore
531.739	their natural curl pattern.
534.739	I know because I have been an advocate
534.739	and an ambassador for this movement
539.1	for roughly the last three years.
541.62	After 27 years of excessive heat
541.62	and harsh chemicals,
547.22	my hair was beginning to show
547.22	extreme signs of wear and tear.
553.3	It was breaking off,
554.86	it was thinning,
556.26	looking just extremely dry and brittle.
559.34	All those years of chasing
559.34	that conventional image of beauty
562.74	that we saw earlier
563.98	was finally beginning to take its toll.
567.62	I wanted to do something about it,
569.86	and so I started what I called
569.86	"the ""No Heat Challenge,"""
574.38	where I would refrain
574.38	from using heat styling tools on my hair
578.26	for six months.
580.78	And like a good millennial,
583.62	I documented it on social media.
585.86	(Laughter)
587.14	I documented as I reluctantly cut off
591.22	three to four inches of my beloved hair.
595.86	I documented as I struggled
595.86	to master these natural hairstyles,
601.42	and also as I struggled to embrace them
605.46	and think that they actually looked good.
609.58	And I documented as my hair texture
609.58	slowly began to change.
616.26	By sharing this journey openly,
618.74	I learned that I was not
618.74	the only woman going through this
622.54	and that in fact there were thousands
622.54	and thousands of other women
626.34	who were longing to do the same.
628.78	So they would reach out to me
628.78	and they would say,
631.14	"""Cheyenne, how did you do"
631.14	that natural hairstyle
633.42	that I saw you with the other day?
635.38	What new products have you started using
637.42	that might be a little better
637.42	for my hair texture
639.78	"as it begins to change?"""
641.78	"Or, ""What are some"
641.78	of the natural hair routines
645.62	that I should begin to adopt
645.62	"to slowly restore the health of my hair?"""
650.98	But I also found that there were
650.98	a large number of women
654.7	who were extremely hesitant
654.7	to take that first step
659.54	because they were paralyzed by fear.
663.22	Fear of the unknown --
664.98	what would they now look like?
667.26	How would they feel about themselves
667.26	with these natural hairstyles?
671.62	And most importantly to them,
674.06	how would others view them?
677.22	Over the last three years
679.06	of having numerous conversations
679.06	with friends of mine
682.98	and also complete strangers
682.98	from around the world,
686.94	I learned some really important things
689.66	about how African-American women
689.66	identify with their hair.
694.62	And so when I think back
696.62	to that hiring manager in Mobile, Alabama,
700.18	"I'd say, ""Actually, no."
702.94	"We don't know what you're talking about."""
705.42	But here are some things that we do know.
708.54	We know that when black women
708.54	embrace their love for their natural hair,
713.54	it helps to undo generations of teaching
717.02	that black in its natural state
717.02	is not beautiful,
720.34	or something to be hidden or covered up.
724.3	We know that black women
724.3	express their individuality
728.58	and experience feelings of empowerment
731.7	by experimenting with different
731.7	hairstyles regularly.
736.7	And we also know
738.34	that when we're invited
738.34	to wear our natural hair in the workplace,
743.26	it reinforces that we are uniquely valued
746.66	and thus helps us to flourish
746.66	and advance professionally.
752.34	I leave you with this.
754.42	In a time of racial and social tension,
758.26	embracing this movement
760.22	and others like this
762.02	help us to rise above
762.02	the confines of the status quo.
766.54	So when you see a woman with braids
766.54	or locks draping down her back,
772.62	or you notice your colleague
775.18	who has stopped
775.18	straightening her hair to work,
779.18	do not simply approach her and admire
782.78	and ask her if you can touch it --
785.62	(Laughter)
786.9	Really appreciate her.
789.74	Applaud her.
790.98	Heck, even high-five her
790.98	if that's what you feel so inclined to do.
795.34	Because this --
796.94	this is more than about a hairstyle.
800.7	It's about self-love and self-worth.
804.42	It's about being brave enough
806.66	not to fold under the pressure
806.66	of others' expectations.
811.62	And about knowing that making
811.62	the decision to stray from the norm
816.22	does not define who we are,
818.7	but it simply reveals who we are.
821.86	And finally,
823.62	being brave is easier
825.5	when we can count
825.5	on the compassion of others.
828.5	So after today,
830.38	I certainly hope that we can count on you.
834.18	Thank you.
835.42	(Applause)
