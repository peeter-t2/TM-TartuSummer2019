13.145	Let's say you despise
15.407	Western democracy.
18.412	Democracy, in all its trappings,
20.648	free elections, town halls,
23.335	endless debates about
23.335	the proper role of government.
26.195	Too messy,
27.552	too unpredictable,
28.732	too constraining for your taste.
31.531	And the way these democracies
31.531	band together and lecture everyone else
35.805	about individual rights and freedoms --
38.12	it gets under your skin.
41.2	So what to do about it?
43.961	You can call out the hypocrisy
43.961	and failures of Western democracies
48.523	and explain how your way is better,
51.776	but that's never really worked for you.
54.536	What if you could get the people
57.236	whose support is the very foundation
57.236	of these democracies
60.4	to start questioning the system?
64.262	Make the idea occur in their own minds
66.734	that democracy and its institutions
66.734	are failing them,
70.87	their elite are corrupt puppet masters
73.154	and the country they knew is in free fall.
77.603	To do that,
78.901	you'll need to infiltrate
78.901	the information spheres
81.923	of these democracies.
83.249	You'll need to turn
83.249	their most powerful asset --
86.974	an open mind --
88.903	into their greatest vulnerability.
91.908	You'll need people to question the truth.
95.922	Now, you'll be familiar of hacking
95.922	and leaks that happened in 2016.
100.688	One was the Democratic
100.688	National Committee's networks,
103.534	and the personal email
103.534	accounts of its staff,
106.389	later released on WikiLeaks.
108.844	After that, various online personas,
111.194	like a supposed Romanian cybercriminal
111.194	who didn't speak Romanian,
116.098	aggressively pushed news
116.098	of these leaks to journalists.
120.811	The media took the bait.
122.631	They were consumed by how much
122.631	the DNC hated Bernie.
126.738	At the time, it was that narrative
126.738	that far outshined the news
131.002	that a group of Russian government
131.002	sponsored hackers
134.366	"who we called ""Advanced"
134.366	"Persistent Threat 28,"""
137.623	"or ""APT28"" for short,"
140.228	was carrying out
140.228	these operations against the US.
144.012	And there was no shortage of evidence.
146.804	This group of Russian government hackers
146.804	hadn't just appeared out of nowhere
150.546	in 2016.
151.734	We had started tracking
151.734	this group back in 2014.
154.915	And the tools that APT28 used
154.915	to compromise its victims' networks
159.82	demonstrated a thoughtful,
159.82	well-resourced effort
163.437	that had taken place for now over a decade
166.287	in Moscow's time zone
167.81	from about 9 am to 6 pm.
170.915	APT28 loved to prey on the emails
170.915	and contacts of journalists in Chechnya,
176.021	the Georgian government,
176.021	eastern European defense attach√©s --
179.552	all targets with an undeniable interest
179.552	to the Russian government.
183.617	We weren't the only ones onto this.
185.601	Governments, research teams
185.601	across the world,
189.042	were coming to similar conclusions
190.973	and observing the same
190.973	types of operations.
194.152	But what Russia was doing in 2016
197.284	went far beyond espionage.
199.88	The DNC hack was just one of many
199.88	where stolen data was posted online
206.522	accompanied by a sensational narrative,
208.8	then amplified in social media
210.762	for lightning-speed adoption by the media.
216.656	This didn't ring the alarm bells
219.222	that a nation-state was trying
219.222	to interfere with the credibility
223.737	of another's internal affairs.
225.685	So why, collectively,
225.685	did we not see this coming?
230.931	Why did it take months
230.931	before Americans understood
234.837	that they were under a state-sponsored
234.837	information attack?
240.276	The easy answer is politics.
241.939	The Obama Administration was caught
241.939	in a perfect catch-22.
245.886	By raising the specter that the Russian
245.886	government was interfering
250.308	in the US presidential campaign,
252.424	the Administration risked appearing
252.424	to meddle in the campaign itself.
257.812	But the better answer, I think,
259.891	is that the US and the West
259.891	were utterly unequipped
263.768	to recognize and respond
263.768	to a modern information operation,
268.446	despite the fact that the US
268.446	had wielded information
273.582	with devastating success
273.582	in an era not so long ago.
278.104	Look, so while the US and the West
278.104	spent the last 20 years
282.022	caught up in cybersecurity --
283.6	what networks to harden,
285.119	which infrastructure to deem critical,
287.452	how to set up armies of cyber warriors
287.452	and cyber commands --
291.469	Russia was thinking in far more
291.469	consequential terms.
297.142	Before the first iPhone
297.142	even hit the shelf,
300.493	the Russian government understood
300.493	the risks and the opportunity
304.99	that technology provided
306.439	and the inter-communication
306.439	and instant communication it provided us.
312.311	As our realities are increasingly
312.311	based on the information
315.552	that we're consuming
315.552	at the palm of our hand
317.932	and from the news feeds
317.932	that we're scanning
320.209	and the hashtags and stories
320.209	that we see trending,
323.199	the Russian government
323.199	was the first to recognize
326.15	how this evolution
328.049	had turned your mind into the most
328.049	exploitable device on the planet.
334.774	And your mind is particularly exploitable
337.262	if you're accustomed
337.262	to an unfettered flow of information,
341.061	now increasingly curated
341.061	to your own tastes.
347.064	This panorama of information
347.064	that's so interesting to you
349.979	gives a state, or anyone for that matter,
349.979	a perfect back door into your mind.
356.798	It's this new brand of state-sponsored
356.798	information operations
360.5	that can be that much more successful,
362.659	more insidious,
363.985	and harder for the target audience --
363.985	that includes the media --
368.095	to decipher and characterize.
370.522	If you can get a hashtag
370.522	trending on Twitter,
372.739	or chum the waters with fake news
375.878	directed to audiences
375.878	primed to receive it,
378.343	or drive journalists to dissect
378.343	terabytes of email
381.244	for a cent of impropriety --
383.243	all tactics used in Russian operations --
385.909	then you've got a shot at effectively
385.909	camouflaging your operations
390.224	in the mind of your target.
393.687	This is what Russia's long called
393.687	"""reflexive control."""
398.669	It's the ability to use
398.669	information on someone else
402.475	so that they make a decision
404.683	on their own accord
406.258	that's favorable to you.
410.111	This is nation-state-grade image control
410.111	and perception management,
414.214	and it's conducted by any means,
416.556	with any tools, network-based
416.556	or otherwise, that will achieve it.
421.631	Take this for another example.
423.085	In early February 2014, a few weeks
423.085	before Russia would invade Crimea,
428.062	a phone call is posted on YouTube.
430.315	In it, there's two US diplomats.
432.714	They sound like they're playing
432.714	kingmaker in Ukraine,
435.932	and worse, they curse the EU
435.932	for its lack of speed and leadership
439.399	in resolving the crisis.
441.887	The media covers the phone call,
444.37	and then the ensuing diplomatic backlash
449.003	leaves Washington and Europe reeling.
452.782	And it creates a fissured response
452.782	and a feckless attitude
456.885	towards Russia's land grab in Ukraine.
459.938	Mission accomplished.
462.468	So while hacked phone calls
462.468	and emails and networks
465.872	keep grabbing the headlines,
467.942	the real operations are the ones
470.6	that are influencing
470.6	the decisions you make
473.432	and the opinions you hold,
475.274	all in the service of a nation-state's
475.274	strategic interest.
479.764	This is power in the information age.
483.347	And this information is all
483.347	that much more seductive,
486.815	all that much easier to take
486.815	at face value and pass on,
490.626	when it's authentic.
492.697	Who's not interested in the truth
492.697	that's presented in phone calls and emails
498.115	that were never intended
498.115	for public consumption?
502.061	But how meaningful is that truth
503.839	if you don't know why
503.839	it's being revealed to you?
507.786	We must recognize that this place
507.786	where we're increasingly living,
511.998	"which we've quaintly termed ""cyberspace,"""
514.307	isn't defined by ones and zeroes,
516.537	but by information
516.537	and the people behind it.
520.648	This is far more than a network
520.648	of computers and devices.
523.815	This is a network composed of minds
526.991	interacting with computers and devices.
530.77	And for this network,
534.448	there's no encryption,
534.448	there's no firewall,
537.853	no two-factor authentication,
539.6	no password complex enough to protect you.
543.388	What you have for defense
545.826	is far stronger, it's more adaptable,
545.826	it's always running the latest version.
551.13	It's the ability to think critically:
554.079	call out falsehood,
555.822	press for the facts.
558.622	And above all, you must have the courage
562.839	to unflinchingly pursue the truth.
567.572	(Applause)
