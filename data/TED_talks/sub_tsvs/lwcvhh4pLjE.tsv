12.924	Tiq Milan: Our first conversation
12.924	was on Facebook,
15.283	and it was three days long.
17.257	(Laughter)
19.127	We shared over 3,000 messages between us,
21.861	and it was during those 72 hours
21.861	that I knew she was going to be my wife.
26.068	We didn't wait any prerequisite
26.068	amount of time for our courtship;
29.258	we told each other
29.258	the vulnerable truths up front:
32.167	I am a transgender man,
33.905	which means the F on my birth
33.905	"certificate should have stood for ""False,"""
37.339	"instead of ""Female."""
38.543	(Laughter)
39.902	Walking around as a woman in the world
41.81	felt like walking with
41.81	pebbles in my shoes.
44.156	It took the rhythm out of my swagger,
46.271	it threw me off balance,
47.555	it pained me with every step
47.555	I took forward.
49.688	But today I'm a man of my own intention;
52.316	a man of my own design.
54.67	Kim Katrin Milan: I am
54.67	a cisgender queer woman.
57.03	Cisgender means the gender
57.03	I was assigned at birth
59.822	is still and has always been female.
62.574	This doesn't make me natural or normal,
65.079	this is just one way of describing
65.079	the many different ways
68.039	that we exist in this world.
70.155	And queer is a cultural term,
72.008	but in this case,
73.229	it refers to the way that I'm not
73.229	restricted by gender
75.876	when it comes to choosing partners.
77.605	I've identified in a few different ways --
79.66	as a bisexual, as a lesbian --
81.294	but for me,
82.395	queerness encompasses all of the layers
82.395	of who I am and how I've loved.
87.617	I'm layers, and not fractions.
90.198	And for me,
91.373	the fact that he was queer
92.73	meant that I could trust his courtship
92.73	from the very beginning.
96.136	As queer and trans people,
97.798	we're so often excluded
97.798	from institutions and traditions.
101.769	We create spaces outside of convention,
104.767	including the conventions of time.
106.903	And in those 3,000 messages between us,
109.98	we collapsed time;
111.242	we queered it;
112.425	we laid it all on the table.
114.211	(Laughter)
115.271	With no pretense at all.
117.513	And this meant that we were able
117.513	to commit to each other
120.336	in a profoundly different way.
122.496	So often what we're told is this idea
122.496	"of the ""Golden Rule,"""
126.588	that we should treat other people
126.588	the way we want to be treated.
130.053	But the problem with that
131.433	is that it assumes that we are
131.433	the standard for other people,
134.688	and we're not.
135.932	We need to treat other people
135.932	the way they want to be treated,
139.446	which means we had to ask.
141.239	I couldn't assume that the kind
141.239	of love that Tiq needed
143.926	was the same kind of love that I needed.
145.912	So I asked him everything --
145.912	about his fears, his insecurities --
150.104	and we started from there.
151.919	TM: I didn't know what
151.919	kind of love I needed.
154.196	I had just come out of a year-long fog
156.42	of being rejected and utterly depleted.
158.983	I had someone look me in my eyes
160.835	and tell me that I was unworthy
160.835	of their love because I was trans.
164.811	And there's a culture of lovelessness
166.62	that we've created around
166.62	transgender people.
168.776	It's reasoned, justified
168.776	and often signed into law.
171.752	And I was a heartbeat away
171.752	from internalizing that message,
174.791	that I wasn't worthy.
176.357	But Kim said that I was her ideal --
178.149	the heartbroken mess that I was.
179.778	(Laughter)
181.349	KKM: He totally was my ideal.
183.03	(Laughter)
184.166	In more ways than one.
185.869	Both poets, writers, creatives
188.27	with a long history
188.27	of community work behind us,
190.775	and big, huge dreams
190.775	of a family in front of us,
193.982	we shared a lot of things in common,
195.738	but we were also incredibly different.
197.606	I've been a lifelong traveler
197.606	and a bit of an orphan,
200.202	whereas he comes from a huge family,
202.368	and definitely stays grounded.
204.533	I often kind of sum up
204.533	the differences in our strengths
207.308	"by saying, ""Keep me safe,"
208.89	"and I'll keep you wild."""
210.354	(Laughter)
214.804	TM: We have marginalized identities
214.804	but we don't live marginalized lives.
219.09	Being queer and trans is about creating
219.09	new ways of existing.
222.914	It's about loving people as they are,
224.721	not as they're supposed to be.
226.597	Kim is unapologetically feminine
228.598	in a world that is often cruel and violent
231.44	to women who are
231.44	too proud and too freeing.
233.747	And I didn't enter into this union
235.392	under the auspices that she
235.392	was going to be my helper or my rib,
238.921	but a fully complex --
240.687	(Laughter)
241.726	KKM: Right? That's not right.
244.044	TM: But a fully complex human being
245.764	whose femininity wasn't for me
245.764	to rein in, control or critique.
249.397	It's her brilliance,
250.943	the way she leads with compassion,
252.611	and how she never loses
252.611	sight of her empathy.
254.78	She has been my hero since day one.
258.987	(Applause)
261.625	KKM: Our relationship has always been
261.625	about setting each other free.
265.327	One of the first questions I asked him
267.184	was what dreams he had left to accomplish,
269.379	and how would I help him get there.
271.463	His dreams to live as a poet,
273.431	to adopt and raise a family together,
275.645	to live a life that he was proud of,
277.385	and one that would live up to
277.385	his mother's incredible legacy.
281.212	And I really appreciated that we
281.212	were able to start from that place,
284.621	and not from a place
284.621	that was around figuring out
287.551	how to make each other work together.
289.72	And I think this really allowed us
289.72	to grow into the people that we were
293.317	in a way that was incredibly different.
295.573	I love him whole;
297.382	pre-transition, now and in the future.
299.829	And it's this love that had us
299.829	committed to each other
302.645	before we'd even seen each other's faces.
306.797	TM: My mother's biggest
306.797	concern when I transitioned
309.26	was who was going to love me as I am.
311.735	Had being transgender somehow
311.735	precluded me from love and monogamy
317.755	because I was supposedly
317.755	born in the wrong body?
320.704	But it's this type of structuring
320.704	that has to be reframed
323.903	in order to let love in.
325.579	My body never betrayed me,
327.496	and my body was never wrong.
329.208	It's this restrictive,
329.208	binary thinking on gender
332.53	that said that I didn't exist.
334.368	But when we met,
335.693	she loved me for exactly how I showed up.
338.17	She would trace her fingers
338.17	along the numb keloid scars
341.145	left by my top surgery.
342.905	Scars that run from the middle of my chest
342.905	all the way out to my outer torso.
346.945	She said that these were
346.945	reminders of my strength
349.719	and everything that I went through
351.424	and nothing for me to be ashamed of.
353.226	So sprinting towards her hand in marriage
355.258	was the queerest thing that I could do.
357.208	(Laughter)
359.993	It flew in the face of more
359.993	conventional trajectories
362.791	of love and relationships,
364.647	because God was never supposed
364.647	to bless a union for folks like us,
367.817	and the law was never
367.817	supposed to recognize it.
370.557	KKM: So on May 5, 2014,
374.072	just about three months
374.072	after meeting online,
377.177	we were married on the steps
377.177	of City Hall in Manhattan,
381.781	and it was beautiful
381.781	in every conceivable way.
385.817	It's safe to say that we
385.817	reimagined some traditions,
389.128	but we also kept some old ones
389.128	that we worked in,
391.966	and we created something
391.966	that worked for us.
394.101	My bouquet and corsage was actually filled
394.101	with wildflowers from Brooklyn --
399.425	also added in a little bit of lavender
399.425	and sage to keep us grounded
403.558	because we were so nervous.
405.289	And it was put together by a sweet
405.289	sister healer friend of ours.
408.843	I never wanted a diamond ring,
410.506	because conflict and convention
410.506	are not my thing,
412.998	so my ring is the deepest purple,
414.827	like the color of my crown chakra,
416.495	and set in place with my birthstones.
419.133	The gift of queerness is options.
421.545	I never had to choose his last name,
423.285	it was never an exception,
424.931	but I did because I am
424.931	my father's bastard child,
428.284	someone who has always been
428.284	an apology, a secret, an imposition.
432.31	And it was incredibly freeing
434.387	to choose the name of a man
434.387	who chose me first.
437.963	(Applause)
444.931	TM: So we told some family
444.931	and some close friends,
447.999	many of whom were still in disbelief
447.999	as we took our vows.
452.026	Fittingly, we posted all of our wedding
452.026	photos on Facebook,
455.139	where we met --
456.364	and Instagram, of course.
458.642	And we quickly realized
460.198	that our coming together was more
460.198	than just a union of two people,
463.42	but was a model of possibility
463.42	for the millions of LGBTQ folks
467.426	who have been sold this lie
468.779	that family and matrimony
468.779	is antithetical to who they are --
471.732	for those of us
471.732	who rarely get to see ourselves
474.486	reflected in love and happiness.
476.438	KKM: And the thing is,
477.613	absolutely we are marginalized
477.613	because of our identities,
480.359	but it also emboldens us
480.359	to be the people that we are.
484.049	Queerness is our major key;
485.973	blackness is our magic.
487.899	It's because of these things
489.519	that we are able to be hopeful, open,
489.519	receptive and shape-shifting.
494.726	These are the things that give us,
496.523	and are such an incredible
496.523	source of, our strength.
499.159	Our queerness is a source
499.159	of that strength.
501.451	I think of the words of Ottawa-based
501.451	poet Brandon Wint:
505.054	"""Not queer like gay;"
505.054	queer like escaping definition.
509.19	Queer like some sort of fluidity
509.19	and limitlessness all at once.
513.72	Queer like a freedom
513.72	too strange to be conquered.
516.722	Queer like the fearlessness
516.722	to imagine what love can look like,
520.013	"and to pursue it."""
522.114	TM: We are part of a community of folks --
524.417	Yeah, that's good right?
525.613	(Laughter)
528.843	We are part of a community of folks
528.843	who are living their authentic selves
532.657	all along the gender spectrum,
534.696	despite the ubiquitous threat of violence,
537.224	despite the undercurrent of anxiety
537.224	that always is present
540.281	for people who live on their own terms.
542.573	Globally, a transgender person
542.573	is murdered every 21 hours.
547.153	And the United States has had more
547.153	trans murders on record this year
553.776	than any year to date.
555.217	However, our stories are much more
555.217	than this rigid dichotomy
559.306	of strength and resilience.
560.782	We are expanding the human
560.782	complexity on these margins,
564.923	and we are creating freedom
564.923	on these margins.
568.288	KKM: And we don't have any blueprints.
570.508	We're creating a world
570.508	that we have literally never seen before;
574.386	organizing families based
574.386	on love and not by blood,
578.031	guiding by a compassion that so few of us
578.031	have been shown ourselves.
582.493	So many of us have not received
582.493	love from our families --
586.531	have been betrayed by the people
586.531	that we trust most.
589.67	So what we do here is we create
589.67	entirely new languages of love.
594.477	Ones that are about creating the space
594.477	for us to be our authentic selves
598.898	and not imposing this standard
600.968	of what masculinity or femininity
600.968	is supposed to be.
604.719	TM: We are interested
604.719	in love and inclusion
607.039	as a tool of revolutionary change, right?
610.12	And the idea is simply,
611.778	if we drop all our preconceived notions
613.928	about how somebody is supposed to be --
616.012	in their body, in their
616.012	gender, in their skin --
619.211	if we take the intentional steps
619.211	to unlearn these deep-seated biases
622.991	and create space for people
622.991	to be self-determined,
625.607	and embrace who they are,
626.959	then we will definitely create a better
626.959	world than the one we were born into.
630.754	(Applause)
637.954	KKM: We want to mark this time in history
639.98	by leaving evidence of the fact
639.98	that we were here.
643.134	We open up little windows
643.134	into our relationship
646.156	for our community to bear witness,
647.853	and we do this because we want
647.853	to make maps to the future
650.904	and not monuments to ourselves.
653.475	Our experience does not invalidate
653.475	other peoples' experience,
657.277	but it should and necessarily does
657.277	complicate this idea
660.881	of what love and marriage
660.881	are supposed to be.
664.691	TM: OK, now for all the talking,
666.691	and inspiring,
668.155	and possibility-modeling we've done,
669.911	we've been nowhere near perfect.
671.66	And we've had to hold
671.66	a mirror up to ourselves.
674.32	And I saw that I wasn't
674.32	always the best listener,
677.159	and that my ego got in the way
677.159	of our progress as a couple.
680.468	And I've had to really assess
680.468	these deep-seated, sexist ideas
683.86	that I've had about the value
683.86	of a woman's experience in the world.
687.185	I've had to reevaluate what it means
687.185	to be in allyship with my wife.
691.61	KKM: And I had to remind myself
691.61	of a lot of things, too.
694.819	What it means to be hard on the issues,
696.827	but soft on the person.
698.603	While we were writing this,
698.603	we got into a massive fight.
702.459	(Laughter)
705.806	For so many different reasons,
707.748	but based on the content about our values
707.748	and our lived experiences --
712.103	and we were really hurt, you know?
713.875	Because what we do and how we love
713.875	puts ourselves entirely on the line.
719.489	But even though the fight lasted
719.489	over the course of two days --
722.952	(Laughter)
724.265	We were able to come back
724.265	together to each other,
727.108	and recommit to ourselves,
727.108	to each other and to our marriage.
731.285	And that really yielded
731.285	some of the most passionate parts
734.03	of what we share with you here today.
736.444	TM: I have had to interrogate masculinity,
738.7	which I think doesn't happen enough.
740.924	I've had to interrogate masculinity;
743.138	the toxic privileges that come
743.138	with being a man don't define me,
746.654	but I have to be accountable
746.654	for how it shows up in my life every day.
750.484	I have allowed my wife
750.484	to do all of the emotional labor
753.875	of prying open the lines of communication
753.875	when I'd rather clam up and run away.
758.137	(Laughter)
759.288	I've stripped away emotional support
759.288	instead of facing my own vulnerabilities,
763.561	particularly around the heartbreaking
763.561	miscarriage we suffered last year,
767	and I'm sorry for that.
768.888	Sometimes as men,
768.888	we get to take the easy way out.
771.77	And so my journey as a trans person
771.77	is about reimagining masculinity.
776.838	About creating a manhood
776.838	that isn't measured
779.377	by the power it wields,
779.377	by the entitlements afforded to it,
782.945	or any simulacrum of control
782.945	that it can muster,
785.474	but works in tandem with femininity,
787.316	and is guided by my spirit.
790.924	KKM: Y'all ...
792.099	(Applause)
796.033	And this has created the space
796.033	for my femininity to flourish
799.935	in a way I had never experienced before.
804.042	He never is threatened by my sexuality,
807.716	he never polices what I wear or how I act.
811.696	I cook but he does way more
811.696	of the cleaning than I do.
814.914	And when we're rushing
814.914	to get out of the house
817.13	and we have so much to handle,
818.656	he handles everything,
820.273	so I have time to do my hair and makeup.
822.484	(Laughter)
824.279	He understands that this is my armor,
826.754	and he never treats femininity
826.754	as though it is frivolous or superficial,
831.287	and this, and him --
833.127	he grows my experience
833.127	of gender every single day.
836.81	TM: I love to watch her
836.81	get dressed in the morning.
839.895	Watching her in the closet,
841.261	looking for something comfortable
841.261	and colorful, and tight,
844.17	and safe --
845.626	(Laughter)
847.093	But it's challenging to watch her
847.093	negotiate her decisions
849.911	looking for something that's going
849.911	to get the least amount of attention,
853.423	but at the same time be an expression
853.423	of the vibrant and sexy woman she is.
857.068	And all I want to do is celebrate
857.068	her for her beauty,
859.83	and the things that make her
859.83	beautiful and special and free,
862.751	from her long acrylic nails,
864.226	to her uncompromising black feminism.
866.27	(Applause)
871.315	KKM: I love you. TM: I love you.
872.99	(Laughter)
874.788	KKM: There are so many queer
874.788	and trans people
877.056	who have come before us,
878.473	whose stories we will never get to hear.
881.547	We constantly experience
881.547	this retelling of history
884.847	where we are conspicuously left out.
887.527	And it's really hard
887.527	to not see ourselves there.
890.891	And so living out loud for us
890.891	is about that representation.
894.798	It's about having possibility models,
897.141	and having hope that love is part
897.141	of our inheritance in this world, too.
901.792	TM: The possibility that we are practicing
903.822	is about reinventing time,
903.822	love and institutions.
907.093	We are creating a future of multiplicity.
909.724	We are expanding the spectrum
909.724	of gender and sexuality,
912.823	imagining ourselves into existence,
915.167	imagining a world where gender
915.167	is self-determined and not imposed,
918.795	and where who we are
918.795	is a kaleidoscope of possibility
921.736	without the narrow-minded limitations
921.736	masquerading as science or justice.
927.193	(Applause)
931.84	KKM: And I can't lie:
933.209	it is really, really hard.
935.643	It is hard to stand in the face of bigotry
938.36	with an open heart and a smile on my face.
940.749	It is really hard to face the injustice
940.749	that exists in the world,
944.004	while still believing in the ability
944.004	of people to really change.
948.591	That takes an enormous amount
948.591	of faith and dedication.
952.058	And beyond that,
953.368	marriage is hard work.
955.501	(Laughter)
956.676	Piles of dirty socks on the floor,
959.268	more boring sports shows
959.268	than I ever thought possible --
963.053	(Laughter)
964.743	And fights that bring me to tears
966.511	when it feels like we're not
966.511	speaking the same language.
969.4	But there is not a day that goes by
971.543	where I am not so grateful
971.543	to be married to this man;
974.8	where I'm not so grateful for
974.8	the possibility of changing minds,
978.65	and rewarding conversations,
980.216	and creating a world
980.216	where love belongs to us all.
983.658	I think about our acronym:
985.139	LGBTQ2SIA.
991.145	A seemingly endless evolution
991.145	of self and a community,
994.822	but also this really deep desire
994.822	not to leave anyone behind.
999.525	We've learned how to love each other,
1001.411	and we've committed to loving each other
1001.411	throughout changes to gender
1005.274	and changes in spirit.
1007.319	And we learned this love
1007.319	in our chat rooms,
1009.966	in our clubs, in our bars
1009.966	and in our community centers.
1013.67	We've learned how to love
1013.67	each other for the long haul.
1016.932	TM &amp; KKM: Thank you.
1018.128	(Applause)
