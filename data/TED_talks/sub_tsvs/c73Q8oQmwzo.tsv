12.731	My son and the iPhone
12.731	were born three weeks apart
16.571	in June 2007.
19.393	So while those early adopters
19.393	were lined up outside,
22.76	waiting to get their hands
22.76	on this amazing new gadget,
25.709	I was stuck at home
25.709	with my hands full of something else
29.677	that was sending out
29.677	constant notifications --
31.947	(Laughter)
33.804	a miserable, colicky baby
36.44	who would only sleep in a moving stroller
36.44	with complete silence.
42.177	I literally was walking
45.211	and the baby weight came off.
46.81	That part was great.
48.435	But man, was I bored.
51.217	Before motherhood, I had been a journalist
53.393	who rushed off when the Concorde crashed.
55.984	I was one of the first
55.984	people into Belgrade
58.429	when there was a revolution in Serbia.
60.954	Now, I was exhausted.
64.186	This walking went on for weeks.
67.086	It was only until about three months in
67.086	that something shifted, though.
72.553	As I pounded the pavement,
74.664	my mind started to wander, too.
77.851	I began imagining what I would do
77.851	when I finally did sleep again.
82.125	So the colic did fade,
84.157	and I finally got an iPhone
86.98	and I put all those hours
86.98	of wandering into action.
89.899	I created my dream job
89.899	hosting a public radio show.
93.839	So there was no more
93.839	rushing off to war zones,
96.023	but thanks to my new smartphone,
97.949	I could be a mother and a journalist.
100.244	I could be on the playground
100.244	and on Twitter at the same time.
105.541	Yeah, well, when I thought that,
107.316	when the technology came in and took over,
109.387	that is when I hit a wall.
112.176	So, I want you to picture this:
114.41	you host a podcast, and you have to prove
116.688	that the investment
116.688	of precious public radio dollars in you
120.132	is worth it.
121.332	My goal was to increase
121.332	my audience size tenfold.
125.601	So one day, I sat down to brainstorm,
128.089	as you do,
129.389	and I came up barren.
131.382	This was different
131.382	than writer's block, right?
133.577	It wasn't like there was something there
133.577	waiting to be unearthed.
136.676	There was just nothing.
138.124	And so I started to think back:
139.626	When was the last time
139.626	I actually had a good idea?
142.417	Yeah, it was when I was pushing
142.417	that damn stroller.
145.872	Now all the cracks in my day
145.872	were filled with phone time.
149.305	I checked the headlines
149.305	while I waited for my latte.
152.854	I updated my calendar
152.854	while I was sitting on the couch.
156.95	Texting turned every spare moment
159.399	into a chance to show to my coworkers
159.399	and my dear husband
162.712	what a responsive person I was,
165.338	or at least it was a chance to find
165.338	another perfect couch
168.247	for my page on Pinterest.
170.829	I realized that I was never bored.
173.668	And anyway, don't only
173.668	boring people get bored?
177.028	But then I started to wonder:
178.434	What actually happens to us
178.434	when we get bored?
180.72	Or, more importantly: What happens to us
180.72	if we never get bored?
184.921	And what could happen if we got rid of
184.921	this human emotion entirely?
189.896	I started talking to neuroscientists
189.896	and cognitive psychologists,
194.171	and what they told me was fascinating.
197.12	It turns out that when you get bored,
198.937	you ignite a network in your brain
198.937	"called the ""default mode."""
203.045	So our body, it goes on autopilot
203.045	while we're folding the laundry
207.928	or we're walking to work,
209.319	but actually that is when our brain
209.319	gets really busy.
212.304	Here's boredom researcher Dr. Sandi Mann.
216.081	(Audio) Dr. Sandi Mann:
216.081	Once you start daydreaming
218.454	and allow your mind to really wander,
220.294	you start thinking a little bit
220.294	beyond the conscious,
222.877	a little bit into the subconscious,
224.624	which allows sort of different
224.624	connections to take place.
227.82	It's really awesome, actually.
229.334	Manoush Zomorodi: Totally awesome, right?
231.864	So this is my brain in an fMRI,
234.091	and I learned that in the default mode
234.091	is when we connect disparate ideas,
238.068	we solve some of our most
238.068	nagging problems,
240.602	and we do something called
240.602	"""autobiographical planning."""
243.667	This is when we look back at our lives,
245.586	we take note of the big moments,
245.586	we create a personal narrative,
248.809	and then we set goals
250.341	and we figure out what steps
250.341	we need to take to reach them.
253.482	But now we chill out on the couch
253.482	also while updating a Google Doc
257.955	or replying to email.
259.899	"We call it ""getting shit done,"""
262.451	but here's what neuroscientist
262.451	Dr. Daniel Levitin says
265.513	we're actually doing.
267.51	(Audio) Dr. Daniel Levitin:
267.51	Every time you shift your attention
270.591	from one thing to another,
271.927	the brain has to engage
271.927	a neurochemical switch
274.679	that uses up nutrients in the brain
274.679	to accomplish that.
277.934	So if you're attempting to multitask,
280.377	you know, doing four
280.377	or five things at once,
282.724	you're not actually doing
282.724	four or five things at once,
285.289	because the brain doesn't work that way.
287.238	Instead, you're rapidly shifting
287.238	from one thing to the next,
290.113	depleting neural resources as you go.
292.18	(Audio) MZ: So switch, switch, switch,
292.18	you're using glucose, glucose, glucose.
295.991	(Audio) DL: Exactly right, and we have
295.991	a limited supply of that stuff.
299.332	MZ: A decade ago, we shifted
299.332	our attention at work
301.765	every three minutes.
303.049	Now we do it every 45 seconds,
305.966	and we do it all day long.
307.827	The average person checks email
311.187	and switches tasks on their computer
317.418	I discovered all this
317.418	talking to professor of informatics,
320.943	Dr. Gloria Mark.
323.127	(Audio) Dr. Gloria Mark: So we find
323.127	that when people are stressed,
326.697	they tend to shift
326.697	their attention more rapidly.
329.892	We also found, strangely enough,
332.155	that the shorter the amount of sleep
332.155	that a person gets,
337.879	the more likely they are
337.879	to check Facebook.
339.999	So we're in this vicious, habitual cycle.
344.065	MZ: But could this cycle be broken?
346.187	What would happen
346.187	if we broke this vicious cycle?
350.487	Maybe my listeners could help me find out.
355.281	What if we reclaimed
355.281	those cracks in our day?
358.416	Could it help us
358.416	jump-start our creativity?
363.042	We called the project
363.042	"""Bored and Brilliant."""
368.084	And I expected, you know,
368.084	a couple hundred people to play along,
371.157	but thousands of people
371.157	started signing up.
374.258	And they told me the reason
374.258	they were doing it
376.454	was because they were worried
376.454	that their relationship with their phone
379.892	had grown kind of ...
379.892	"""codependent,"" shall we say."
384.084	(Audio) Man: The relationship
384.084	between a baby and its teddy bear
387.779	or a baby and its binky
389.618	or a baby that wants its mother's cradle
392.92	when it's done with being held
392.92	by a stranger --
395.966	(Laughs)
397.042	that's the relationship
397.042	between me and my phone.
400.018	(Audio) Woman: I think of my phone
400.018	like a power tool:
402.817	extremely useful, but dangerous
402.817	if I'm not handling it properly.
406.75	(Audio) Woman 2:
406.75	If I don't pay close attention,
409.052	I'll suddenly realize
409.052	that I've lost an hour of time
411.529	doing something totally mindless.
413.544	MZ: OK, but to really measure
413.544	any improvement,
415.871	we needed data, right?
417.316	Because that's what we do these days.
419.531	So we partnered with some apps
419.531	that would measure how much time
422.693	we were spending every day on our phone.
424.809	If you're thinking it's ironic
426.31	that I asked people
426.31	to download another app
428.383	so that they would spend
428.383	less time on their phones:
430.93	yeah, but you gotta meet people
430.93	where they are.
433.261	(Laughter)
434.787	So before challenge week,
436.589	we were averaging two hours
436.589	a day on our phones
439.481	and 60 pickups,
441.213	you know, like, a quick check,
441.213	did I get a new email?
443.964	Here's what Tina, a student
443.964	at Bard College,
446.198	discovered about herself.
448.552	(Audio) Tina: So far, I've been spending
450.553	between 150 and 200 minutes
450.553	on my phone per day,
454.039	and I've been picking up my phone
458.188	And it's really concerning,
459.888	because that's so much time
459.888	that I could have spent
462.346	doing something more productive,
462.346	more creative, more towards myself,
466.222	because when I'm on my phone,
466.222	I'm not doing anything important.
469.204	MZ: Like Tina, people were starting
469.204	to observe their own behavior.
472.573	They were getting ready
472.573	for challenge week.
475.171	And that Monday,
476.969	they started to wake up
476.969	to instructions in their inbox,
479.868	an experiment to try.
481.885	Day one:
483.46	"""Put it in your pocket."""
485.069	Take that phone out of your hand.
487.385	See if you can eliminate the reflex
487.385	to check it all day long,
490.384	just for a day.
491.902	And if this sounds easy,
493.407	you haven't tried it.
494.68	Here's listener Amanda Itzko.
496.764	(Audio) Amanda Itzko:
496.764	I am absolutely itching.
500.528	I feel a little bit crazy,
503.008	because I have noticed
503.008	that I pick up my phone
507.716	when I'm just walking
507.716	from one room to another,
511.648	getting on the elevator,
512.938	and even -- and this is the part
512.938	that I am really embarrassed
516.739	to actually say out loud --
518.75	in the car.
520.201	MZ: Yikes.
521.398	Yeah, well, but as Amanda learned,
523.091	this itching feeling
523.091	is not actually her fault.
526.498	That is exactly the behavior
526.498	that the technology is built to trigger.
530.873	(Laughter)
535.557	I mean, right?
537.627	Here's former Google designer,
537.627	Tristan Harris.
541.129	(Audio) Tristan Harris: If I'm Facebook
541.129	or I'm Netflix or I'm Snapchat,
544.529	I have literally a thousand engineers
546.411	whose job is to get
546.411	more attention from you.
549.006	I'm very good at this,
550.569	and I don't want you to ever stop.
552.309	And you know, the CEO
552.309	of Netflix recently said,
554.555	"""Our biggest competitors"
554.555	"are Facebook, YouTube and sleep."""
557.801	I mean, so there's a million places
557.801	to spend your attention,
561.099	but there's a war going on to get it.
563.05	MZ: I mean, you know the feeling:
564.772	that amazing episode
564.772	"of ""Transparent"" ends,"
566.925	and then the next one starts playing
568.701	so you're like, eh, OK fine,
568.701	I'll just stay up and watch it.
571.625	Or the LinkedIn progress bar
571.625	says you are this close
574.728	to having the perfect profile,
576.908	so you add a little more
576.908	personal information.
580.04	As one UX designer told me,
582.058	the only people who refer
582.058	"to their customers as ""users"""
585.355	are drug dealers and technologists.
587.447	(Laughter)
588.827	(Applause)
595.199	And users, as we know,
595.199	are worth a lot of money.
598.647	Here's former Facebook
598.647	product manager and author,
602.081	Antonio García Martínez.
605.367	(Audio) Antonio García Martínez:
605.367	The saying is, if any product is free
608.709	then you're the product;
608.709	your attention is the product.
611.334	But what is your attention worth?
612.932	That's why literally every time
612.932	you load a page,
615.209	not just on Facebook or any app,
616.773	there's an auction being held instantly,
616.773	billions of times a day,
619.868	for exactly how much
619.868	that one ad impression cost.
622.206	MZ: By the way, the average person
622.206	will spend two years of their life
625.517	on Facebook.
627.042	So, back to challenge week.
628.608	Immediately, we saw
628.608	some creativity kick in.
632.044	Here's New Yorker Lisa Alpert.
634.593	(Audio) Lisa Alpert: I was bored, I guess.
636.781	So I suddenly looked at the stairway
636.781	that went up to the top of the station,
641.41	and I thought, you know,
642.973	I had just come down that stairway,
642.973	but I could go back up
646.258	and then come back down
646.258	and get a little cardio.
648.767	So I did,
649.955	and then I had a little more time,
649.955	so I did it again and I did it again,
653.82	and I did it 10 times.
655.65	And I had a complete cardio workout.
658.045	I got on that R train feeling
658.045	kind of exhausted,
660.496	but, like, wow,
660.496	that had never occurred to me.
663.184	How is that possible?
664.603	(Laughter)
665.731	MZ: So creativity, I learned, means
665.731	different things to different people.
669.741	(Laughter)
670.765	But everyone found
670.765	day three's challenge the hardest.
674.342	"It was called ""Delete that app."""
676.582	Take that app -- you know the one;
678.483	that one that always gets you,
678.483	it sucks you in --
681.283	take it off your phone,
682.47	even if just for the day.
683.882	I deleted the game Two Dots
683.882	and nearly cried.
687.168	(Laughter)
688.238	Yeah, Two Dots players
688.238	know what I'm talking about.
690.681	But my misery had good company.
696.194	(Audio) Man 2: This is Liam
696.194	in Los Angeles,
698.47	and I deleted Twitter, Facebook,
698.47	Instagram, Tumblr, Snapchat and Vine
703.327	from my phone
704.506	in one fell swoop.
706.131	And it was kind of an embarrassingly
706.131	emotional experience at first.
710.796	It felt weirdly lonely
710.796	to look at that lock screen
714.692	with no new notifications on it.
717.073	But I really liked deciding for myself
720.145	when to think about or access
720.145	my social networks,
723.561	not giving my phone the power
723.561	to decide that for me.
727.559	So thank you.
728.761	(Audio) Woman 3: Deleting the Twitter app
728.761	was very sad,
731.476	and I feel I maybe, over the last year
731.476	when I've been on Twitter,
735.038	have developed an addiction to it,
736.682	"and this ""Bored and Brilliant"" challenge"
736.682	has really made me realize it.
740.094	After a brief period of really horrible
740.094	withdrawal feeling,
743.25	like lack-of-caffeine headache,
745.243	I now feel lovely.
746.843	I had a lovely dinner with my family,
748.678	and I hope to continue this structured use
748.678	of these powerful tools.
753.377	(Audio) Woman 4: I don't have
753.377	that guilty gut feeling
755.9	I have when I know
755.9	I'm wasting time on my phone.
758.219	Maybe I'll have to start giving myself
758.219	challenges and reminders like this
761.745	every morning.
762.921	MZ: I mean, yes, this was progress.
764.638	I could not wait to see
764.638	what the numbers said
767.129	at the end of that week.
769.971	But when the data came in,
771.898	it turned out that we had cut down,
774.195	on average,
775.457	just six minutes --
777.747	from 120 minutes a day on our phones
780.581	to 114.
783.474	Yeah. Whoop-de-do.
785.117	So I went back to the scientists
785.117	feeling kind of low,
788.851	and they just laughed at me,
790.355	and they said, you know,
790.355	changing people's behavior
792.81	in such a short time period
794.367	was ridiculously ambitious,
796.618	and actually what you've achieved
796.618	is far beyond what we thought possible.
801.861	Because more important than the numbers,
801.861	were the people's stories.
805.721	They felt empowered.
807.387	Their phones had been transformed
810.05	from taskmasters
811.803	back into tools.
814.528	And actually, I found what
814.528	the young people said most intriguing.
818.502	Some of them told me
819.681	that they didn't recognize
819.681	some of the emotions
821.967	that they felt during challenge week,
823.786	because, if you think about it,
825.297	if you have never known life
825.297	without connectivity,
828.285	you may never have experienced boredom.
831.291	And there could be consequences.
833.381	Researchers at USC have found --
833.381	they're studying teenagers
836.834	who are on social media
836.834	while they're talking to their friends
839.818	or they're doing homework,
841.128	and two years down the road,
841.128	they are less creative and imaginative
844.967	about their own personal futures
846.845	and about solving societal problems,
846.845	like violence in their neighborhoods.
851.511	And we really need this next generation
854.14	to be able to focus on some big problems:
856.39	climate change, economic disparity,
858.858	massive cultural differences.
861.482	No wonder CEOs in an IBM survey
864.227	identified creativity as the number one
864.227	leadership competency.
870.034	OK, here's the good news, though:
871.726	In the end, 20,000 people
871.726	"did ""Bored and Brilliant"" that week."
875.521	Ninety percent cut down on their minutes.
877.977	Seventy percent got more time to think.
880.871	People told me that they slept better.
883.024	They felt happier.
884.365	My favorite note was from a guy
884.365	who said he felt like he was waking up
888.013	from a mental hibernation.
891.961	Some personal data and some neuroscience
894.429	gave us permission
894.429	to be offline a little bit more,
897.594	and a little bit of boredom
897.594	gave us some clarity
900.561	and helped some of us set some goals.
903.976	I mean, maybe constant connectivity
906.111	won't be cool in a couple of years.
909.893	But meanwhile, teaching people,
909.893	especially kids,
913.475	how to use technology
913.475	to improve their lives
916.626	and to self-regulate
918.065	needs to be part of digital literacy.
922.505	So the next time you go
922.505	to check your phone,
925.452	remember that if you don't decide
925.452	how you're going to use the technology,
929.548	the platforms will decide for you.
932.833	And ask yourself:
934.438	What am I really looking for?
936.2	Because if it's to check email,
936.2	that's fine -- do it and be done.
939.919	But if it's to distract yourself
939.919	from doing the hard work
942.611	that comes with deeper thinking,
944.935	take a break,
946.367	stare out the window
948.487	and know that by doing nothing
951.356	you are actually being
951.356	your most productive and creative self.
956.082	It might feel weird
956.082	and uncomfortable at first,
958.829	but boredom truly can lead to brilliance.
962.214	Thank you.
