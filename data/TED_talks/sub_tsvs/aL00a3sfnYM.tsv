13.099	I study ants
14.718	in the desert, in the tropical forest
18.015	and in my kitchen,
19.543	and in the hills around Silicon Valley where I live.
23.563	I've recently realized that ants
25.239	are using interactions differently
27.517	in different environments,
29.345	and that got me thinking
29.345	that we could learn from this
31.345	about other systems,
32.9	like brains and data networks that we engineer,
38.488	and even cancer.
41.334	So what all these systems have in common
43.086	is that there's no central control.
45.943	An ant colony consists of sterile female workers --
49.763	those are the ants you see walking around â€”
52.149	and then one or more reproductive females
54.305	who just lay the eggs.
56.408	They don't give any instructions.
58.417	Even though they're called queens,
60.401	they don't tell anybody what to do.
62.566	So in an ant colony, there's no one in charge,
65.842	and all systems like this without central control
68.62	are regulated using very simple interactions.
72.549	Ants interact using smell.
75.276	They smell with their antennae,
77.463	and they interact with their antennae,
80.224	so when one ant touches another with its antennae,
83.233	it can tell, for example, if the other ant
84.84	is a nestmate
86.474	and what task that other ant has been doing.
90.71	So here you see a lot of ants moving around
93.91	and interacting in a lab arena
95.843	that's connected by tubes to two other arenas.
99.281	So when one ant meets another,
101.785	it doesn't matter which ant it meets,
103.874	and they're actually not transmitting
105.759	any kind of complicated signal or message.
109.224	All that matters to the ant is the rate
111.335	at which it meets other ants.
114.156	And all of these interactions, taken together,
116.913	produce a network.
119.418	So this is the network of the ants
121.628	that you just saw moving around in the arena,
124.272	and it's this constantly shifting network
127.559	that produces the behavior of the colony,
130.079	like whether all the ants are hiding inside the nest,
132.96	or how many are going out to forage.
135.654	A brain actually works in the same way,
137.413	but what's great about ants is
138.913	that you can see the whole network as it happens.
143.78	There are more than 12,000 species of ants,
146.88	in every conceivable environment,
149.005	and they're using interactions differently
151.654	to meet different environmental challenges.
154.422	So one important environmental challenge
156.727	that every system has to deal with
158.597	is operating costs, just what it takes
160.68	to run the system.
162.945	And another environmental challenge is resources,
165.493	finding them and collecting them.
167.829	In the desert, operating costs are high
170.612	because water is scarce,
172.385	and the seed-eating ants that I study in the desert
174.884	have to spend water to get water.
177.784	So an ant outside foraging,
179.923	searching for seeds in the hot sun,
181.96	just loses water into the air.
183.967	But the colony gets its water
185.631	by metabolizing the fats out of the seeds
187.397	that they eat.
189.331	So in this environment, interactions are used
192.49	to activate foraging.
194.039	An outgoing forager doesn't go out unless
196.303	it gets enough interactions with returning foragers,
198.876	and what you see are the returning foragers
200.866	going into the tunnel, into the nest,
202.69	and meeting outgoing foragers on their way out.
205.326	This makes sense for the ant colony,
206.949	because the more food there is out there,
209.272	the more quickly the foragers find it,
211.123	the faster they come back,
212.359	and the more foragers they send out.
215.16	The system works to stay stopped,
217.667	unless something positive happens.
219.682	So interactions function to activate foragers.
223.563	And we've been studying
223.563	the evolution of this system.
226.47	First of all, there's variation.
227.561	It turns out that colonies are different.
230.04	On dry days, some colonies forage less,
232.736	so colonies are different in how
234.241	they manage this trade-off
235.595	between spending water to search for seeds
238.763	and getting water back in the form of seeds.
242.083	And we're trying to understand why
243.802	some colonies forage less than others
245.942	by thinking about ants as neurons,
248.267	using models from neuroscience.
250.605	So just as a neuron adds up its stimulation
253.279	from other neurons to decide whether to fire,
255.285	an ant adds up its stimulation from other ants
258.17	to decide whether to forage.
260.193	And what we're looking for is whether there might be
261.83	small differences among colonies
263.822	in how many interactions each ant needs
267.136	before it's willing to go out and forage,
269.062	because a colony like that would forage less.
272.829	And this raises an analogous question about brains.
275.968	We talk about the brain,
277.38	but of course every brain is slightly different,
280.27	and maybe there are some individuals
281.649	or some conditions
282.968	in which the electrical properties of neurons are such
286.19	that they require more stimulus to fire,
290.06	and that would lead to differences in brain function.
293.786	So in order to ask evolutionary questions,
296.12	we need to know about reproductive success.
298.799	This is a map of the study site
301.124	where I have been tracking this population
303.677	of harvester ant colonies for 28 years,
306.97	which is about as long as a colony lives.
309.232	Each symbol is a colony,
311.331	and the size of the symbol is
311.331	how many offspring it had,
314.597	because we were able to use genetic variation
316.51	to match up parent and offspring colonies,
319.221	that is, to figure out which colonies
322.518	were founded by a daughter queen
324.443	produced by which parent colony.
326.511	And this was amazing for me, after all these years,
328.513	to find out, for example, that colony 154,
331.641	whom I've known well for many years,
333.817	is a great-grandmother.
335.636	Here's her daughter colony,
337.376	here's her granddaughter colony,
340.06	and these are her great-granddaughter colonies.
342.452	And by doing this, I was able to learn
344.477	that offspring colonies resemble parent colonies
347.76	in their decisions about which days are so hot
349.977	that they don't forage,
351.755	and the offspring of parent colonies
353.219	live so far from each other that the ants never meet,
356.125	so the ants of the offspring colony
358.414	can't be learning this from the parent colony.
360.658	And so our next step is to look
362.039	for the genetic variation
362.039	underlying this resemblance.
367.315	So then I was able to ask, okay, who's doing better?
371.44	Over the time of the study,
372.9	and especially in the past 10 years,
374.365	there's been a very severe and deepening drought
377.673	in the Southwestern U.S.,
379.8	and it turns out that the
379.8	colonies that conserve water,
382.853	that stay in when it's really hot outside,
387.282	and thus sacrifice getting as much food as possible,
389.914	are the ones more likely to have offspring colonies.
392.859	So all this time, I thought that colony 154
395.128	was a loser, because on really dry days,
397.798	there'd be just this trickle of foraging,
399.666	while the other colonies were out
401.257	foraging, getting lots of food,
403.374	but in fact, colony 154 is a huge success.
406.394	She's a matriarch.
407.726	She's one of the rare great-grandmothers on the site.
410.778	To my knowledge, this is the first time
413.563	that we've been able to track
415.202	the ongoing evolution of collective behavior
418.203	in a natural population of animals
420.32	and find out what's actually working best.
424.977	Now, the Internet uses an algorithm
427.398	to regulate the flow of data
430.251	that's very similar to the one
432.478	that the harvester ants are using to regulate
434.854	the flow of foragers.
436.395	And guess what we call this analogy?
439.761	The anternet is coming.
441.279	(Applause)
443	So data doesn't leave the source computer
446.454	unless it gets a signal that there's enough bandwidth
449.315	for it to travel on.
452.044	In the early days of the Internet,
453.485	when operating costs were really high
455.759	and it was really important not to lose any data,
458.986	then the system was set up for interactions
461.143	to activate the flow of data.
464.205	It's interesting that the ants are using an algorithm
466.59	that's so similar to the one that we recently invented,
470.486	but this is only one of a handful of ant algorithms
473.439	that we know about,
474.858	and ants have had 130 million years
478.051	to evolve a lot of good ones,
480.077	and I think it's very likely
481.583	that some of the other 12,000 species
484.14	are going to have interesting algorithms
486.837	for data networks
487.861	that we haven't even thought of yet.
490.558	So what happens when operating costs are low?
493.643	Operating costs are low in the tropics,
495.43	because it's very humid, and it's easy for the ants
497.526	to be outside walking around.
500.35	But the ants are so abundant
502.003	and diverse in the tropics
503.821	that there's a lot of competition.
506.419	Whatever resource one species is using,
508.371	another species is likely to be using that
511.543	at the same time.
513.922	So in this environment, interactions are used
516.53	in the opposite way.
518.475	The system keeps going
519.87	unless something negative happens,
521.424	and one species that I study makes circuits
523.591	in the trees of foraging ants
525.75	going from the nest to a food source and back,
528.731	just round and round,
530.06	unless something negative happens,
531.502	like an interaction
533.111	with ants of another species.
535.85	So here's an example of ant security.
538.787	In the middle, there's an ant
540.645	plugging the nest entrance with its head
543.108	in response to interactions with another species.
546.101	Those are the little ones running around
547.76	with their abdomens up in the air.
550.511	But as soon as the threat is passed,
552.557	the entrance is open again,
555.312	and maybe there are situations
557.102	in computer security
558.191	where operating costs are low enough
560.397	that we could just block access temporarily
563.772	in response to an immediate threat,
565.965	and then open it again,
567.991	instead of trying to build
569.26	a permanent firewall or fortress.
573.24	So another environmental challenge
575.18	that all systems have to deal with
576.875	is resources, finding and collecting them.
582.327	And to do this, ants solve the problem
584	of collective search,
585.258	and this is a problem that's of great interest
586.834	right now in robotics,
588.318	because we've understood that,
590.05	rather than sending a single,
591.664	sophisticated, expensive robot out
595.159	to explore another planet
596.576	or to search a burning building,
599.143	that instead, it may be more effective
601.743	to get a group of cheaper robots
606.12	exchanging only minimal information,
608.665	and that's the way that ants do it.
611.464	So the invasive Argentine ant
613.229	makes expandable search networks.
615.559	They're good at dealing with the main problem
617.832	of collective search,
619.163	which is the trade-off between
621.729	searching very thoroughly
623.065	and covering a lot of ground.
625.062	And what they do is,
625.957	when there are many ants in a small space,
628.344	then each one can search very thoroughly
630.557	because there will be another ant nearby
632.181	searching over there,
633.538	but when there are a few ants
635.185	in a large space,
637.24	then they need to stretch out their paths
639.654	to cover more ground.
641.457	I think they use interactions to assess density,
644.411	so when they're really crowded,
645.64	they meet more often,
646.742	and they search more thoroughly.
649.207	Different ant species must use different algorithms,
652.607	because they've evolved to deal with
655.129	different resources,
656.8	and it could be really useful to know about this,
659.359	and so we recently asked ants
661.001	to solve the collective search problem
663.451	in the extreme environment
664.819	of microgravity
666.377	in the International Space Station.
668.353	When I first saw this picture, I thought,
669.898	Oh no, they've mounted the habitat vertically,
672.755	but then I realized that, of course, it doesn't matter.
675.373	So the idea here is that the ants
678.01	are working so hard to hang on
679.98	to the wall or the floor or whatever you call it
683.037	that they're less likely to interact,
686.046	and so the relationship between
687.29	how crowded they are and how often they meet
689.41	would be messed up.
691.135	We're still analyzing the data.
692.53	I don't have the results yet.
694.494	But it would be interesting to know
696.188	how other species solve this problem
698.647	in different environments on Earth,
701.211	and so we're setting up a program
702.477	to encourage kids around the world
704.637	to try this experiment with different species.
707.173	It's very simple.
708.94	It can be done with cheap materials.
711.03	And that way, we could make a global map
713.863	of ant collective search algorithms.
717.21	And I think it's pretty likely that the invasive species,
719.693	the ones that come into our buildings,
721.842	are going to be really good at this,
723.584	because they're in your kitchen
725.432	because they're really good
725.432	at finding food and water.
729.339	So the most familiar resource for ants
732.604	is a picnic,
733.919	and this is a clustered resource.
736.064	When there's one piece of fruit,
737.063	there's likely to be another piece of fruit nearby,
739.578	and the ants that specialize on clustered resources
743.01	use interactions for recruitment.
744.952	So when one ant meets another,
746.229	or when it meets a chemical deposited
747.854	on the ground by another,
749.59	then it changes direction to follow
751.423	in the direction of the interaction,
752.996	and that's how you get the trail of ants
754.973	sharing your picnic.
756.386	Now this is a place where I think we might be able
758.081	to learn something from ants about cancer.
761.822	I mean, first, it's obvious that we could do a lot
763.803	to prevent cancer
765.413	by not allowing people to spread around
767.99	or sell the toxins that promote
769.934	the evolution of cancer in our bodies,
772.714	but I don't think the ants can help us much with this
775.06	because ants never poison their own colonies.
778.418	But we might be able to learn something from ants
779.75	about treating cancer.
781.513	There are many different kinds of cancer.
783.738	Each one originates in a particular part of the body,
786.716	and then some kinds of cancer will spread
789.682	or metastasize to particular other tissues
792.512	where they must be getting
792.512	resources that they need.
795.392	So if you think from the perspective
797.2	of early metastatic cancer cells
799.15	as they're out searching around
800.773	for the resources that they need,
803.09	if those resources are clustered,
805.073	they're likely to use interactions for recruitment,
808.086	and if we can figure out how
808.086	cancer cells are recruiting,
811.179	then maybe we could set traps
813.526	to catch them before they become established.
817.575	So ants are using interactions in different ways
820.81	in a huge variety of environments,
823.412	and we could learn from this
825.233	about other systems that operate
827.01	without central control.
829.347	Using only simple interactions,
831.326	ant colonies have been performing
833.121	amazing feats for more than 130 million years.
836.754	We have a lot to learn from them.
838.894	Thank you.
841.632	(Applause)
