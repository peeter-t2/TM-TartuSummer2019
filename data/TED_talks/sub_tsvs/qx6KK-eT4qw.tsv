161.254	Thank you very much. (Applause)
166.614	Thank you. It's a distinct privilege to be here.
170.287	A few weeks ago, I saw a video on YouTube
172.211	of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords
174.491	at the early stages of her recovery
176.65	from one of those awful bullets.
178.835	This one entered her left hemisphere, and
180.956	knocked out her Broca's area, the speech center of her brain.
184.472	And in this session, Gabby's working with a speech therapist,
188.378	and she's struggling to produce
190.167	some of the most basic words, and you can see her
193.279	growing more and more devastated, until she ultimately
196.458	breaks down into sobbing tears, and she starts sobbing
199.334	wordlessly into the arms of her therapist.
203.31	And after a few moments, her therapist tries a new tack,
205.627	and they start singing together,
207.262	and Gabby starts to sing through her tears,
209.403	and you can hear her clearly able to enunciate
212.066	the words to a song that describe the way she feels,
214.527	and she sings, in one descending scale, she sings,
217.447	"""Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine."""
221.056	And it's a very powerful and poignant reminder of how
224.037	the beauty of music has the ability to speak
227.601	where words fail, in this case literally speak.
232.377	Seeing this video of Gabby Giffords reminded me
234.13	of the work of Dr. Gottfried Schlaug,
236.931	one of the preeminent neuroscientists studying music and the brain at Harvard,
240.682	and Schlaug is a proponent of a therapy called
243.101	Melodic Intonation Therapy, which has become very popular in music therapy now.
248.114	Schlaug found that his stroke victims who were aphasic,
252.437	could not form sentences of three- or four-word sentences,
257.087	but they could still sing the lyrics to a song,
260.39	"whether it was ""Happy Birthday To You"""
262.339	or their favorite song by the Eagles or the Rolling Stones.
264.977	And after 70 hours of intensive singing lessons,
267.916	he found that the music was able to literally rewire
271.918	the brains of his patients and create a homologous
274.37	speech center in their right hemisphere
276.262	to compensate for the left hemisphere's damage.
279.761	When I was 17, I visited Dr. Schlaug's lab, and in one afternoon
283.146	he walked me through some of the leading research
285.662	on music and the brain -- how musicians had
289.497	fundamentally different brain structure than non-musicians,
292.561	how music, and listening to music,
294.071	could just light up the entire brain, from
296.325	our prefrontal cortex all the way back to our cerebellum,
299.799	how music was becoming a neuropsychiatric modality
302.626	to help children with autism, to help people struggling
306.249	with stress and anxiety and depression,
309.034	how deeply Parkinsonian patients would find that their tremor
312.449	and their gait would steady when they listened to music,
315.83	and how late-stage Alzheimer's patients, whose dementia
319.239	was so far progressed that they could no longer recognize
322.135	their family, could still pick out a tune by Chopin
324.921	at the piano that they had learned when they were children.
328.583	But I had an ulterior motive of visiting Gottfried Schlaug,
331.63	and it was this: that I was at a crossroads in my life,
334.848	trying to choose between music and medicine.
337.633	I had just completed my undergraduate, and I was working
340.594	as a research assistant at the lab of Dennis Selkoe,
343.467	studying Parkinson's disease at Harvard, and I had fallen
346.93	in love with neuroscience. I wanted to become a surgeon.
349.797	I wanted to become a doctor like Paul Farmer or Rick Hodes,
353.575	these kind of fearless men who go into places like Haiti or Ethiopia
357.692	and work with AIDS patients with multidrug-resistant
360.523	tuberculosis, or with children with disfiguring cancers.
364.312	I wanted to become that kind of Red Cross doctor,
367.236	that doctor without borders.
369.24	On the other hand, I had played the violin my entire life.
372.783	Music for me was more than a passion. It was obsession.
376.525	It was oxygen. I was lucky enough to have studied
379.688	at the Juilliard School in Manhattan, and to have played
382.767	my debut with Zubin Mehta and the Israeli philharmonic orchestra in Tel Aviv,
387.122	and it turned out that Gottfried Schlaug
389.16	had studied as an organist at the Vienna Conservatory,
392.384	but had given up his love for music to pursue a career
394.767	in medicine. And that afternoon, I had to ask him,
398.448	"""How was it for you making that decision?"""
400.984	And he said that there were still times when he wished
403.013	he could go back and play the organ the way he used to,
405.785	and that for me, medical school could wait,
409.002	but that the violin simply would not.
411.777	And after two more years of studying music, I decided
414.337	to shoot for the impossible before taking the MCAT
417.146	and applying to medical school like a good Indian son
419.722	to become the next Dr. Gupta. (Laughter)
422.58	And I decided to shoot for the impossible and I took
425.212	an audition for the esteemed Los Angeles Philharmonic.
428.155	It was my first audition, and after three days of playing
431.157	behind a screen in a trial week, I was offered the position.
434.183	And it was a dream. It was a wild dream to perform
438.101	in an orchestra, to perform in the iconic Walt Disney Concert Hall
441.601	in an orchestra conducted now by the famous Gustavo Dudamel,
445.185	but much more importantly to me to be surrounded
448.171	by musicians and mentors that became my new family,
452.061	my new musical home.
455.255	But a year later, I met another musician who had also
458.965	studied at Juilliard, one who profoundly helped me
462.054	find my voice and shaped my identity as a musician.
466.412	Nathaniel Ayers was a double bassist at Juilliard, but
469.693	he suffered a series of psychotic episodes in his early 20s,
473.432	was treated with thorazine at Bellevue,
475.778	and ended up living homeless on the streets of Skid Row
479.254	in downtown Los Angeles 30 years later.
481.7	Nathaniel's story has become a beacon for homelessness
485.145	and mental health advocacy throughout the United States,
488.003	"as told through the book and the movie ""The Soloist,"""
490.148	but I became his friend, and I became his violin teacher,
493.294	and I told him that wherever he had his violin,
495.804	and wherever I had mine, I would play a lesson with him.
498.775	And on the many times I saw Nathaniel on Skid Row,
501.454	I witnessed how music was able to bring him back
504.263	from his very darkest moments, from what seemed to me
507.23	in my untrained eye to be
509.19	the beginnings of a schizophrenic episode.
512.99	Playing for Nathaniel, the music took on a deeper meaning,
516.244	because now it was about communication,
518.802	a communication where words failed, a communication
521.712	of a message that went deeper than words, that registered
524.87	at a fundamentally primal level in Nathaniel's psyche,
528.359	yet came as a true musical offering from me.
532.906	I found myself growing outraged that someone
536.883	like Nathaniel could have ever been homeless on Skid Row
540.792	because of his mental illness, yet how many tens of thousands
544.131	of others there were out there on Skid Row alone
547.236	who had stories as tragic as his, but were never going to have a book or a movie
551.992	made about them that got them off the streets?
554.254	And at the very core of this crisis of mine, I felt somehow
558.267	the life of music had chosen me, where somehow,
562.362	perhaps possibly in a very naive sense, I felt what Skid Row
565.331	really needed was somebody like Paul Farmer
568.342	and not another classical musician playing on Bunker Hill.
572.483	But in the end, it was Nathaniel who showed me
574.533	that if I was truly passionate about change,
577.26	if I wanted to make a difference, I already had the perfect instrument to do it,
581.583	that music was the bridge that connected my world and his.
586.352	There's a beautiful quote
588.024	by the Romantic German composer Robert Schumann,
590.488	"who said, ""To send light into the darkness of men's hearts,"
595.697	"such is the duty of the artist."""
598.122	And this is a particularly poignant quote
600.558	because Schumann himself suffered from schizophrenia
603.297	and died in asylum.
605.405	And inspired by what I learned from Nathaniel,
607.867	I started an organization on Skid Row of musicians
610.231	called Street Symphony, bringing the light of music
613.424	into the very darkest places, performing
616.068	for the homeless and mentally ill at shelters and clinics
618.655	on Skid Row, performing for combat veterans
622.685	with post-traumatic stress disorder, and for the incarcerated
626.095	and those labeled as criminally insane.
629.899	After one of our events at the Patton State Hospital
632.292	in San Bernardino, a woman walked up to us
634.813	and she had tears streaming down her face,
637.13	and she had a palsy, she was shaking,
639.596	and she had this gorgeous smile, and she said
642.618	that she had never heard classical music before,
644.6	she didn't think she was going to like it, she had never
647.026	heard a violin before, but that hearing this music was like hearing the sunshine,
651.128	and that nobody ever came to visit them, and that for the first time in six years,
654.497	when she heard us play, she stopped shaking without medication.
659.3	Suddenly, what we're finding with these concerts,
662.258	away from the stage, away from the footlights, out
665.3	of the tuxedo tails, the musicians become the conduit
668.921	for delivering the tremendous therapeutic benefits
672.043	of music on the brain to an audience that would never
675.136	have access to this room,
676.938	would never have access to the kind of music that we make.
682.77	Just as medicine serves to heal more
686.201	than the building blocks of the body alone,
689.499	"the power and beauty of music transcends the ""E"""
693.266	in the middle of our beloved acronym.
696.001	Music transcends the aesthetic beauty alone.
699.639	The synchrony of emotions that we experience when we
702.649	hear an opera by Wagner, or a symphony by Brahms,
705.906	or chamber music by Beethoven, compels us to remember
709.552	our shared, common humanity, the deeply communal
713.46	connected consciousness, the empathic consciousness
716.875	that neuropsychiatrist Iain McGilchrist says is hard-wired
720.448	into our brain's right hemisphere.
723.524	And for those living in the most dehumanizing conditions
726.92	of mental illness within homelessness
729.081	and incarceration, the music and the beauty of music
731.864	offers a chance for them to transcend the world around them,
736.496	to remember that they still have the capacity to experience
739.878	something beautiful and that humanity has not forgotten them.
743.83	And the spark of that beauty, the spark of that humanity
746.691	transforms into hope,
749.491	and we know, whether we choose the path of music
752.451	or of medicine, that's the very first thing we must instill
755.66	within our communities, within our audiences,
757.599	if we want to inspire healing from within.
761.53	I'd like to end with a quote by John Keats,
764.206	the Romantic English poet,
766.251	a very famous quote that I'm sure all of you know.
769.189	Keats himself had also given up a career in medicine
772.208	to pursue poetry, but he died when he was a year older than me.
775.529	"And Keats said, ""Beauty is truth, and truth beauty."
780.602	"That is all ye know on Earth, and all ye need to know."""
789.857	(Music)
953.98	(Applause)
