12.878	What's one thing that every person
12.878	in this room is going to become?
16.994	Older.
18.195	And most of us are scared stiff
18.195	at the prospect.
20.785	How does that word make you feel?
23.633	I used to feel the same way.
25.648	What was I most worried about?
27.454	Ending up drooling
27.454	in some grim institutional hallway.
31.131	And then I learned that only
31.131	four percent of older Americans
34.338	are living in nursing homes,
35.751	and the percentage is dropping.
37.971	What else was I worried about?
40.09	Dementia.
41.524	Turns out that most of us
41.524	can think just fine to the end.
44.693	Dementia rates are dropping, too.
46.626	The real epidemic is anxiety
46.626	over memory loss.
49.555	(Laughter)
51.439	I also figured that old people
51.439	were depressed
53.979	because they were old
53.979	and they were going to die soon.
57.452	(Laughter)
59.225	It turns out that the longer people live,
61.203	the less they fear dying,
62.726	and that people are happiest at
62.726	the beginnings and the end of their lives.
66.479	It's called the U-curve of happiness,
68.5	and it's been borne out
68.5	by dozens of studies around the world.
71.829	You don't have to be a Buddhist
71.829	or a billionaire.
74.429	The curve is a function of the way
74.429	aging itself affects the brain.
78.948	So I started feeling a lot better
78.948	about getting older,
82.254	and I started obsessing about why
82.254	so few people know these things.
87.179	The reason is ageism:
88.849	discrimination and stereotyping
88.849	on the basis of age.
92.995	We experience it anytime someone assumes
92.995	we're too old for something,
96.906	instead of finding out who we are
96.906	and what we're capable of,
100.23	or too young.
101.727	Ageism cuts both ways.
104.099	All -isms are socially constructed
104.099	ideas -- racism, sexism, homophobia --
109.414	and that means we make them up,
111.618	and they can change over time.
113.948	All these prejudices
113.948	pit us against each other
116.971	to maintain the status quo,
119.137	like auto workers in the US competing
119.137	against auto workers in Mexico
123.283	instead of organizing for better wages.
125.89	(Applause)
127.803	We know it's not OK to allocate
127.803	resources by race or by sex.
132.218	Why should it be OK to weigh
132.218	the needs of the young against the old?
136.407	"All prejudice relies on ""othering"" --"
136.407	seeing a group of people
140.067	as other than ourselves:
141.515	other race, other religion,
141.515	other nationality.
145.016	The strange thing about ageism:
147.338	that other is us.
150.046	Ageism feeds on denial --
150.046	our reluctance to acknowledge
153.036	that we are going to become
153.036	that older person.
156.47	It's denial when we try
156.47	to pass for younger
159.644	or when we believe in anti-aging products,
162.582	or when we feel like our bodies
162.582	are betraying us,
165.418	simply because they are changing.
168.047	Why on earth do we stop celebrating
168.047	the ability to adapt and grow
172.013	as we move through life?
174.02	Why should aging well mean
174.02	struggling to look and move
177.188	like younger versions of ourselves?
179.697	It's embarrassing
179.697	to be called out as older
181.844	until we quit being embarrassed about it,
183.939	and it's not healthy to go through life
183.939	dreading our futures.
187.097	The sooner we get off
187.097	this hamster wheel of age denial,
190.557	the better off we are.
193.461	Stereotypes are always
193.461	a mistake, of course,
195.563	but especially when it comes to age,
197.313	because the longer we live,
198.674	the more different
198.674	from one another we become.
200.842	Right? Think about it.
202.243	And yet, we tend to think of everyone
202.243	in a retirement home
204.993	as the same age: old --
206.887	(Laughter)
208.428	when they can span four decades.
210.882	Can you imagine thinking that way
210.882	about a group of people
213.573	between the ages of 20 and 60?
216.458	When you get to a party, do you head
216.458	for people your own age?
219.705	Have you ever grumbled
219.705	about entitled millennials?
223.459	Have you ever rejected a haircut
223.459	or a relationship or an outing
226.985	because it's not age-appropriate?
229.359	For adults, there's no such thing.
231.603	All these behaviors are ageist.
233.662	We all do them,
235.357	and we can't challenge bias
235.357	unless we're aware of it.
238.518	Nobody's born ageist,
239.878	but it starts at early childhood,
241.568	around the same time attitudes
241.568	towards race and gender start to form,
245.042	because negative messages
245.042	about late life bombard us
248.498	from the media and popular
248.498	culture at every turn.
251.874	Right? Wrinkles are ugly.
253.471	Old people are pathetic.
255.012	It's sad to be old.
256.863	Look at Hollywood.
258.278	A survey of recent
258.278	Best Picture nominations
260.406	found that only 12 percent
260.406	of speaking or named characters
264.203	were age 60 and up,
265.733	and many of them
265.733	were portrayed as impaired.
268.845	Older people can be
268.845	the most ageist of all,
270.911	because we've had a lifetime
270.911	to internalize these messages
274.179	and we've never thought to challenge them.
276.683	I had to acknowledge it
278.193	and stop colluding.
279.921	"""Senior moment"" quips, for example:"
282.168	I stopped making them when it dawned on me
284.216	that when I lost
284.216	the car keys in high school,
286.358	"I didn't call it a ""junior moment."""
288.118	(Laughter)
290.579	I stopped blaming
290.579	my sore knee on being 64.
293.73	My other knee doesn't hurt,
295.298	and it's just as old.
296.798	(Laughter)
298.834	(Applause)
300.151	We are all worried about
300.151	some aspect of getting older,
303.113	whether running out of money,
304.725	getting sick, ending up alone,
307.126	and those fears are legitimate and real.
310.084	But what never dawns on most of us
311.82	is that the experience of reaching old age
313.954	can be better or worse
313.954	depending on the culture
316.589	in which it takes place.
318.575	It is not having a vagina
318.575	that makes life harder for women.
321.875	It's sexism.
323.113	(Applause)
325.032	It's not loving a man that makes
325.032	life harder for gay guys.
327.805	It's homophobia.
329.128	And it is not the passage of time
329.128	that makes getting older
332.74	so much harder than it has to be.
334.353	It is ageism.
335.706	When labels are hard to read
337.312	or there's no handrail
338.677	or we can't open the damn jar,
340.361	we blame ourselves,
341.759	our failure to age successfully,
344.147	instead of the ageism that makes
344.147	those natural transitions shameful
348.165	and the discrimination that makes
348.165	those barriers acceptable.
352.335	You can't make money off satisfaction,
354.349	but shame and fear create markets,
357.051	and capitalism always needs new markets.
360.189	Who says wrinkles are ugly?
361.924	The multi-billion-dollar
361.924	skin care industry.
365.122	Who says perimenopause and low T
365.122	and mild cognitive impairment
369.015	are medical conditions?
370.332	The trillion-dollar
370.332	pharmaceutical industry.
372.746	(Cheers)
373.801	The more clearly we see
373.801	these forces at work,
375.955	the easier it is to come up
375.955	with alternative, more positive
379.259	and more accurate narratives.
382.155	Aging is not a problem to be fixed
382.155	or a disease to be cured.
386.724	It is a natural, powerful,
386.724	lifelong process that unites us all.
392.552	Changing the culture is a tall order,
392.552	I know that, but culture is fluid.
396.69	Look at how much the position
396.69	of women has changed in my lifetime
400.029	or the incredible strides
400.029	that the gay rights movement
402.578	has made in just a few decades, right?
404.664	(Applause)
405.712	Look at gender.
407.203	We used to think of it
407.203	as a binary, male or female,
409.884	and now we understand it's a spectrum.
412.074	It is high time to ditch
412.074	the old-young binary, too.
415.692	There is no line in the sand
415.692	between old and young,
418.366	after which it's all downhill.
420.342	And the longer we wait
420.342	to challenge that idea,
422.627	the more damage it does
422.627	to ourselves and our place in the world,
426.689	like in the workforce,
426.689	where age discrimination is rampant.
430.466	In Silicon Valley, engineers
430.466	are getting Botoxed and hair-plugged
433.935	before key interviews --
435.287	and these are skilled
435.287	white men in their 30s,
437.792	so imagine the effects
437.792	further down the food chain.
440.288	(Laughter)
442.474	The personal and economic
442.474	consequences are devastating.
445.869	Not one stereotype about older workers
445.869	holds up under scrutiny.
450.039	Companies aren't adaptable and creative
450.039	because their employees are young;
454.141	they're adaptable and creative despite it.
457.114	Companies --
458.293	(Laughter)
459.381	(Applause)
461.997	We know that diverse companies
461.997	aren't just better places to work;
465.099	they work better.
466.308	And just like race and sex,
466.308	age is a criterion for diversity.
470.873	A growing body of fascinating research
472.933	shows that attitudes towards aging
474.65	affect how our minds and bodies
474.65	function at the cellular level.
478.2	When we talk to older people
478.2	like this (Speaks more loudly)
481.07	"or call them ""sweetie"" or ""young lady"" --"
483.069	it's called elderspeak --
484.42	they appear to instantly age,
486.447	walking and talking less competently.
489.395	People with more positive
489.395	feelings towards aging
491.711	walk faster,
492.907	they do better on memory tests,
494.518	they heal quicker, and they live longer.
497.834	Even with brains
497.834	full of plaques and tangles,
500.475	some people stayed sharp to the end.
502.995	What did they have in common?
504.673	A sense of purpose.
506.003	And what's the biggest obstacle
506.003	to having a sense of purpose in late life?
509.505	A culture that tells us that getting older
509.505	means shuffling offstage.
513.647	That's why the World Health
513.647	Organization is developing
516.442	a global anti-ageism initiative
518.054	to extend not just
518.054	life span but health span.
521.894	Women experience the double whammy
523.927	of ageism and sexism,
525.591	so we experience aging differently.
528.12	There's a double standard
528.12	at work here -- shocker --
530.991	(Laughter)
532.283	the notion that aging enhances men
532.283	and devalues women.
536.457	Women reinforce this double standard
536.457	when we compete to stay young,
540.806	another punishing and losing proposition.
543.481	Does any woman in this room really believe
546.225	that she is a lesser version --
548.235	less interesting, less fun in bed,
548.235	less valuable --
551.655	than the woman she once was?
554.254	This discrimination affects our health,
556.162	our well-being and our income,
557.915	and the effects add up over time.
560.42	They are further compounded
560.42	by race and by class,
563.075	which is why, everywhere in the world,
565.311	the poorest of the poor
565.311	are old women of color.
569.308	What's the takeaway from that map?
571.329	By 2050, one out of five of us,
573.761	almost two billion people,
575.531	will be age 60 and up.
577.577	Longevity is a fundamental hallmark
577.577	of human progress.
581.072	All these older people represent a vast
581.072	unprecedented and untapped market.
587.089	And yet, capitalism and urbanization
587.089	have propelled age bias
591.025	into every corner of the globe,
593.088	from Switzerland,
593.088	where elders fare the best,
595.53	to Afghanistan, which sits at the bottom
595.53	of the Global AgeWatch Index.
600.54	Half of the world's countries
600.54	aren't mentioned on that list
603.425	because we don't bother to collect data
603.425	on millions of people
607.041	because they're no longer young.
609.416	Almost two-thirds of people
609.416	over 60 around the world
612.274	say they have trouble
612.274	accessing healthcare.
614.873	Almost three-quarters say their income
614.873	doesn't cover basic services
618.704	like food, water, electricity,
618.704	and decent housing.
623.034	Is this the world we want our children,
623.034	who may well live to be a hundred,
627.089	to inherit?
628.374	Everyone -- all ages,
628.374	all genders, all nationalities --
632.413	is old or future-old,
634.649	and unless we put an end to it,
634.649	ageism will oppress us all.
638.538	And that makes it a perfect target
638.538	for collective advocacy.
643.115	Why add another -ism to the list
643.115	when so many, racism in particular,
647.148	call out for action?
648.96	Here's the thing:
650.217	we don't have to choose.
652.011	When we make the world
652.011	a better place to grow old in,
654.73	we make it a better place
654.73	in which to be from somewhere else,
657.895	to have a disability,
659.453	to be queer, to be non-rich,
659.453	to be non-white.
663.109	And when we show up at all ages
663.109	for whatever cause matters most to us --
667.53	save the whales, save the democracy --
670.279	we not only make
670.279	that effort more effective,
672.833	we dismantle ageism in the process.
675.856	Longevity is here to stay.
678.197	A movement to end ageism is underway.
680.732	I'm in it, and I hope you will join me.
684.059	(Applause and cheers)
688.415	Thank you. Let's do it! Let's do it!
693.027	(Applause)
