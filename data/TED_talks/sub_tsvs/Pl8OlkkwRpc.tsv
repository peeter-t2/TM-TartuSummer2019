12.831	The technology likely to have
12.831	the greatest impact
16.301	on the next few decades
18.071	has arrived.
19.744	And it's not social media.
22.265	It's not big data.
23.686	It's not robotics.
25.217	It's not even AI.
27.033	You'll be surprised to learn
29.423	that it's the underlying technology
29.423	of digital currencies like Bitcoin.
34.159	It's called the blockchain. Blockchain.
38.337	Now, it's not the most sonorous
38.337	word in the world,
42.294	but I believe that this is now
44.734	the next generation of the internet,
47.299	and that it holds vast promise
47.299	for every business, every society
51.898	and for all of you, individually.
54.367	You know, for the past few decades,
54.367	we've had the internet of information.
59.066	And when I send you an email
59.066	or a PowerPoint file or something,
63.311	I'm actually not sending you the original,
65.409	I'm sending you a copy.
67.222	And that's great.
68.763	This is democratized information.
72.441	But when it comes to assets --
75.223	things like money,
77.592	financial assets like stocks and bonds,
80.071	loyalty points, intellectual property,
83.53	music, art, a vote,
86.982	carbon credit and other assets --
89.611	sending you a copy is a really bad idea.
92.247	If I send you 100 dollars,
94.066	it's really important
94.066	that I don't still have the money --
97.127	(Laughter)
98.158	and that I can't send it to you.
100.54	This has been called
100.54	"the ""double-spend"" problem"
102.901	by cryptographers for a long time.
105.469	So today, we rely entirely
105.469	on big intermediaries --
110.762	middlemen like banks, government,
113.039	big social media companies,
113.039	credit card companies and so on --
116.627	to establish trust in our economy.
119.779	And these intermediaries perform
119.779	all the business and transaction logic
124.897	of every kind of commerce,
126.317	from authentication,
126.317	identification of people,
129.002	through to clearing, settling
129.002	and record keeping.
133.583	And overall, they do a pretty good job.
135.528	But there are growing problems.
137.942	To begin, they're centralized.
139.498	That means they can be hacked,
139.498	and increasingly are --
142.49	JP Morgan, the US Federal Government,
145.073	LinkedIn, Home Depot and others
146.888	found that out the hard way.
148.874	They exclude billions of people
148.874	from the global economy,
152.412	for example, people
152.412	who don't have enough money
154.689	to have a bank account.
156.624	They slow things down.
158.936	It can take a second for an email
158.936	to go around the world,
162.53	but it can take days or weeks
164.978	for money to move through
164.978	the banking system across a city.
168.134	And they take a big piece of the action --
	to another country.
174.022	They capture our data,
175.687	and that means we can't monetize it
177.663	or use it to better manage our lives.
180.441	Our privacy is being undermined.
183.202	And the biggest problem is that overall,
186.005	they've appropriated the largesse
186.005	of the digital age asymmetrically:
191.91	we have wealth creation,
191.91	but we have growing social inequality.
197.105	So what if there were not only
197.105	an internet of information,
201.471	what if there were an internet of value --
204.517	some kind of vast, global,
204.517	distributed ledger
208.669	running on millions of computers
210.831	and available to everybody.
212.939	And where every kind of asset,
212.939	from money to music,
216.814	could be stored, moved, transacted,
216.814	exchanged and managed,
222.542	all without powerful intermediaries?
225.507	What if there were
225.507	a native medium for value?
230.256	Well, in 2008, the financial
230.256	industry crashed
234.938	and, perhaps propitiously,
237.546	an anonymous person or persons
237.546	named Satoshi Nakamoto
243.325	created a paper where he developed
243.325	a protocol for a digital cash
250.335	that used an underlying
250.335	cryptocurrency called Bitcoin.
254.421	And this cryptocurrency enabled people
254.421	to establish trust and do transactions
260.263	without a third party.
261.978	And this seemingly simple act
261.978	set off a spark
265.738	that ignited the world,
267.909	that has everyone excited
267.909	or terrified or otherwise interested
273.076	in many places.
274.64	Now, don't be confused about Bitcoin --
276.734	Bitcoin is an asset; it goes up and down,
279.933	and that should be of interest
279.933	to you if you're a speculator.
283.525	More broadly, it's a cryptocurrency.
285.954	It's not a fiat currency
285.954	controlled by a nation-state.
289.327	And that's of greater interest.
291.412	But the real pony here
291.412	is the underlying technology.
294.65	It's called blockchain.
297.649	So for the first time now
297.649	in human history,
301.116	people everywhere can trust each other
303.618	and transact peer to peer.
307.001	And trust is established,
307.001	not by some big institution,
311.265	but by collaboration, by cryptography
314.345	and by some clever code.
316.502	And because trust is native
316.502	to the technology,
320.08	"I call this, ""The Trust Protocol."""
322.896	Now, you're probably wondering:
322.896	How does this thing work?
325.674	Fair enough.
328.29	Assets -- digital assets like money
328.29	to music and everything in between --
333.469	are not stored in a central place,
335.159	but they're distributed
335.159	across a global ledger,
337.879	using the highest level of cryptography.
340.945	And when a transaction is conducted,
343.612	it's posted globally,
345.714	across millions and millions of computers.
349.508	And out there, around the world,
351.376	"is a group of people called ""miners."""
353.694	These are not young people,
353.694	they're Bitcoin miners.
357.21	They have massive computing power
357.21	at their fingertips --
	than all of Google worldwide.
365.598	These miners do a lot of work.
368.122	And every 10 minutes,
369.519	kind of like the heartbeat of a network,
371.83	a block gets created
374.059	that has all the transactions
374.059	from the previous 10 minutes.
377.714	Then the miners get to work,
377.714	trying to solve some tough problems.
382.873	And they compete:
384.219	the first miner to find out the truth
384.219	and to validate the block,
388.554	is rewarded in digital currency,
390.939	in the case of the Bitcoin
390.939	blockchain, with Bitcoin.
394.171	And then -- this is the key part --
396.355	that block is linked to the previous block
398.836	and the previous block
400.169	to create a chain of blocks.
403.441	And every one is time-stamped,
404.904	kind of like with a digital waxed seal.
407.434	So if I wanted to go and hack a block
409.805	and, say, pay you and you
409.805	with the same money,
414.394	I'd have to hack that block,
415.941	plus all the preceding blocks,
417.395	the entire history of commerce
417.395	on that blockchain,
420.813	not just on one computer
420.813	but across millions of computers,
424.328	simultaneously,
426.131	all using the highest
426.131	levels of encryption,
429.49	in the light of the most powerful
429.49	computing resource in the world
432.604	that's watching me.
433.876	Tough to do.
435.51	This is infinitely more secure
437.736	than the computer systems
437.736	that we have today.
440.119	Blockchain. That's how it works.
443.402	So the Bitcoin blockchain is just one.
445.607	There are many.
446.782	The Ethereum blockchain was developed
446.782	by a Canadian named Vitalik Buterin.
451.7	He's [22] years old,
453.954	and this blockchain
453.954	has some extraordinary capabilities.
458.196	One of them is that you can
458.196	build smart contracts.
461.303	It's kind of what it sounds like.
463.295	It's a contract that self-executes,
465.882	and the contract handles the enforcement,
465.882	the management, performance
470.773	and payment -- the contract kind of has
470.773	a bank account, too, in a sense --
475.058	of agreements between people.
477.718	And today, on the Ethereum blockchain,
480.456	there are projects underway
480.456	to do everything
482.767	from create a new replacement
482.767	for the stock market
485.953	to create a new model of democracy,
487.8	where politicians
487.8	are accountable to citizens.
490.927	(Applause)
494.411	So to understand what a radical change
494.411	this is going to bring,
498.514	let's look at one industry,
498.514	financial services.
501.249	Recognize this?
503.061	Rube Goldberg machine.
505	It's a ridiculously complicated machine
505	that does something really simple,
508.705	like crack an egg or shut a door.
511.593	Well, it kind of reminds me
511.593	of the financial services industry,
515.449	honestly.
516.639	I mean, you tap your card
516.639	in the corner store,
519.568	and a bitstream goes through
519.568	a dozen companies,
522.843	each with their own computer system,
525.23	some of them being 1970s mainframes
527.559	older than many
527.559	of the people in this room,
530.375	and three days later, a settlement occurs.
533.74	Well, with a blockchain
533.74	financial industry,
537.288	there would be no settlement,
538.715	because the payment and the settlement
538.715	is the same activity,
541.597	it's just a change in the ledger.
544.04	So Wall Street and all around the world,
546.324	the financial industry
546.324	is in a big upheaval about this,
549.611	wondering, can we be replaced,
551.786	or how do we embrace
551.786	this technology for success?
555.349	Now, why should you care?
558.32	Well, let me describe some applications.
561.748	Prosperity.
563.44	The first era of the internet,
565.472	the internet of information,
566.837	brought us wealth
566.837	but not shared prosperity,
570.324	because social inequality is growing.
572.802	And this is at the heart
572.802	of all of the anger and extremism
576.809	and protectionism and xenophobia and worse
580.433	that we're seeing growing
580.433	in the world today,
583.039	Brexit being the most recent case.
586.868	So could we develop some new approaches
586.868	to this problem of inequality?
592.635	Because the only approach today
592.635	is to redistribute wealth,
596.408	tax people and spread it around more.
598.612	Could we pre-distribute wealth?
601.686	Could we change the way that wealth
601.686	gets created in the first place
604.906	by democratizing wealth creation,
607.1	engaging more people in the economy,
609.517	and then ensuring that they got
609.517	fair compensation?
613.158	Let me describe five ways
613.158	that this can be done.
616.597	Number one:
618.047	Did you know that 70 percent
618.047	of the people in the world who have land
623.3	have a tenuous title to it?
625.863	So, you've got a little farm in Honduras,
625.863	some dictator comes to power,
629.279	"he says, ""I know you've got a piece"
629.279	of paper that says you own your farm,
632.895	but the government computer
632.895	"says my friend owns your farm."""
636.967	This happened on a mass scale in Honduras,
639.169	and this problem exists everywhere.
642.214	Hernando de Soto, the great
642.214	Latin American economist,
645.013	says this is the number one
645.013	issue in the world
647.181	in terms of economic mobility,
648.799	more important than having a bank account,
650.964	because if you don't have
650.964	a valid title to your land,
653.621	you can't borrow against it,
655.201	and you can't plan for the future.
657.969	So today, companies
657.969	are working with governments
661.333	to put land titles on a blockchain.
663.8	And once it's there, this is immutable.
666.718	You can't hack it.
668.313	This creates the conditions for prosperity
671.492	for potentially billions of people.
674.505	Secondly:
676.295	a lot of writers talk about Uber
678.553	and Airbnb and TaskRabbit
678.553	and Lyft and so on
681.912	as part of the sharing economy.
684.232	This is a very powerful idea,
685.92	that peers can come together
685.92	and create and share wealth.
689.71	My view is that ...
691.729	these companies are not really sharing.
695.748	In fact, they're successful
695.748	precisely because they don't share.
699.879	They aggregate services together,
699.879	and they sell them.
703.71	What if, rather than Airbnb
703.71	being a $25 billion corporation,
708.666	there was a distributed application
708.666	on a blockchain, we'll call it B-Airbnb,
714.196	and it was essentially owned
714.196	by all of the people
718.254	who have a room to rent.
720.574	And when someone wants to rent a room,
723.169	they go onto the blockchain
723.169	database and all the criteria,
727.335	they sift through, it helps
727.335	them find the right room,
729.866	and then the blockchain helps
729.866	with the contracting,
732.659	it identifies the party,
734.555	it handles the payments
735.937	just through digital payments --
735.937	they're built into the system.
739.207	And it even handles reputation,
740.762	because if she rates a room
740.762	as a five-star room,
744.978	that room is there,
746.218	and it's rated, and it's immutable.
749.043	So, the big sharing-economy
749.043	disruptors in Silicon Valley
754.542	could be disrupted,
756.096	and this would be good for prosperity.
758.361	Number three:
760.403	the biggest flow of funds
760.403	from the developed world
762.998	to the developing world
764.308	is not corporate investment,
766.594	and it's not even foreign aid.
769.605	It's remittances.
772.329	This is the global diaspora;
774.288	people have left their ancestral lands,
776.669	and they're sending money back
776.669	to their families at home.
780.582	This is 600 billion dollars a year,
780.582	and it's growing,
783.729	and these people are getting ripped off.
786.555	Analie Domingo is a housekeeper.
789.864	She lives in Toronto,
791.793	and every month she goes
791.793	to the Western Union office
796.581	with some cash
798.144	to send her remittances
798.144	to her mom in Manila.
801.835	It costs her around 10 percent;
803.752	the money takes four to seven
803.752	days to get there;
806.016	her mom never knows
806.016	when it's going to arrive.
808.204	It takes five hours
808.204	out of her week to do this.
811.571	Six months ago,
812.747	Analie Domingo used
812.747	a blockchain application called Abra.
817.771	And from her mobile device,
817.771	she sent 300 bucks.
820.408	It went directly
820.408	to her mom's mobile device
822.912	without going through an intermediary.
825.346	And then her mom
825.346	looked at her mobile device --
827.762	it's kind of like an Uber interface,
827.762	"there's Abra ""tellers"" moving around."
831.575	She clicks on a teller
831.575	that's a five-star teller,
834.337	who's seven minutes away.
836.266	The guy shows up at the door,
836.266	gives her Filipino pesos,
839.37	she puts them in her wallet.
841.365	The whole thing took minutes,
843.145	and it cost her two percent.
846.269	This is a big opportunity for prosperity.
849.637	Number four: the most powerful asset
849.637	of the digital age is data.
854.279	And data is really a new asset class,
857.966	maybe bigger than previous asset classes,
860.269	like land under the agrarian economy,
863.254	or an industrial plant,
864.931	or even money.
866.54	And all of you -- we -- create this data.
869.574	We create this asset,
871.38	and we leave this trail
871.38	of digital crumbs behind us
874.119	as we go throughout life.
875.973	And these crumbs are collected
875.973	into a mirror image of you,
878.817	the virtual you.
880.481	And the virtual you may know
880.481	more about you than you do,
883.176	because you can't remember
883.176	what you bought a year ago,
885.831	or said a year ago,
885.831	or your exact location a year ago.
888.494	And the virtual you is not owned by you --
891.295	that's the big problem.
893.419	So today, there are companies working
896.021	to create an identity in a black box,
899.682	the virtual you owned by you.
901.853	And this black box moves around with you
905.182	as you travel throughout the world,
907.196	and it's very, very stingy.
909.29	It only gives away
909.29	the shred of information
912.369	that's required to do something.
913.94	A lot of transactions,
915.253	the seller doesn't even need
915.253	to know who you are.
917.75	They just need to know that they got paid.
920.741	And then this avatar
920.741	is sweeping up all of this data
924.714	and enabling you to monetize it.
928.061	And this is a wonderful thing,
929.873	because it can also help us
929.873	protect our privacy,
933.088	and privacy is the foundation
933.088	of a free society.
936.924	Let's get this asset that we create
938.914	back under our control,
940.715	where we can own our own identity
942.747	and manage it responsibly.
945.817	Finally --
946.998	(Applause)
952.335	Finally, number five:
953.855	there are a whole number
953.855	of creators of content
957.141	who don't receive fair compensation,
959.372	because the system
959.372	for intellectual property is broken.
962.488	It was broken by the first era
962.488	of the internet.
965.624	Take music.
967.734	Musicians are left with crumbs
967.734	at the end of the whole food chain.
970.888	You know, if you were a songwriter,
975.752	it got a million singles,
978.038	you could get royalties
978.038	of around 45,000 dollars.
981.583	Today, you're a songwriter,
981.583	you write a hit song,
983.923	it gets a million streams,
985.4	you don't get 45k,
987.194	you get 36 dollars,
989.805	enough to buy a nice pizza.
992.721	So Imogen Heap,
994.123	the Grammy-winning singer-songwriter,
996.531	is now putting music
996.531	on a blockchain ecosystem.
1000.526	"She calls it ""Mycelia."""
1002.399	And the music has
1002.399	a smart contract surrounding it.
1006.529	And the music protects
1006.529	her intellectual property rights.
1010.076	You want to listen to the song?
1011.613	It's free, or maybe a few micro-cents
1011.613	that flow into a digital account.
1014.994	You want to put the song
1014.994	in your movie, that's different,
1017.716	and the IP rights are all specified.
1019.499	You want to make a ringtone?
1019.499	That's different.
1022.23	She describes that the song
1022.23	becomes a business.
1025.463	It's out there on this platform
1025.463	marketing itself,
1028.296	protecting the rights of the author,
1030.287	and because the song has a payment system
1032.466	in the sense of bank account,
1033.952	all the money flows back to the artist,
1036.324	and they control the industry,
1038.583	rather than these powerful intermediaries.
1041.757	Now, this is --
1042.932	(Applause)
1047.604	This is not just songwriters,
1049.325	it's any creator of content,
1050.848	like art,
1052.339	like inventions,
1054.831	scientific discoveries, journalists.
1057.816	There are all kinds of people
1057.816	who don't get fair compensation,
1060.853	and with blockchains,
1062.347	they're going to be able
1062.347	to make it rain on the blockchain.
1066.133	And that's a wonderful thing.
1068.775	So, these are five opportunities
1073.392	out of a dozen
1074.69	to solve one problem, prosperity,
1077.015	which is one of countless problems
1080.087	that blockchains are applicable to.
1083.036	Now, technology doesn't create
1083.036	prosperity, of course -- people do.
1087.507	But my case to you is that, once again,
1091.905	the technology genie
1091.905	has escaped from the bottle,
1095.366	and it was summoned
1095.366	by an unknown person or persons
1098.602	at this uncertain time in human history,
1102.216	and it's giving us
1102.216	another kick at the can,
1105.511	another opportunity to rewrite
1105.511	the economic power grid
1110.652	and the old order of things,
1112.4	and solve some of the world's most
1112.4	difficult problems,
1117.272	if we will it.
1119.915	Thank you.
1121.131	(Applause)
