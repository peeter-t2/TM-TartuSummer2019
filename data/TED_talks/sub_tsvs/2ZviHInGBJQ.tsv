13.097	It was April, last year.
15.714	I was on an evening out with friends
17.485	to celebrate one of their birthdays.
19.677	We hadn't been all together
19.677	for a couple of weeks;
22.094	it was a perfect evening,
22.094	as we were all reunited.
25.22	At the end of the evening,
26.497	I caught the last underground train
26.497	back to the other side of London.
30.663	The journey was smooth.
32.479	I got back to my local station
34.011	and I began the 10-minute walk home.
37.159	As I turned the corner onto my street,
39.547	my house in sight up ahead,
41.596	I heard footsteps behind me
43.004	that seemed to have
43.004	approached out of nowhere
45.191	and were picking up pace.
47.778	Before I had time to process
47.778	what was happening,
50.329	a hand was clapped around my mouth
50.329	so that I could not breathe,
53.484	and the young man behind me
53.484	dragged me to the ground,
56.208	beat my head repeatedly
56.208	against the pavement
58.358	until my face began to bleed,
60.364	kicking me in the back and neck
62.596	while he began to assault me,
64.272	ripping off my clothes
64.272	"and telling me to ""shut up,"""
66.758	as I struggled to cry for help.
69.423	With each smack of my head
69.423	to the concrete ground,
71.843	a question echoed through my mind
71.843	that still haunts me today:
75.118	"""Is this going to be how it all ends?"""
78.828	Little could I have realized,
78.828	I'd been followed the whole way
81.764	from the moment I left the station.
83.739	And hours later,
84.966	I was standing topless and barelegged
84.966	in front of the police,
88.534	having the cuts and bruises
88.534	on my naked body photographed
91.33	for forensic evidence.
93.956	Now, there are few words to describe
93.956	the all-consuming feelings
97.219	of vulnerability, shame, upset
97.219	and injustice that I was ridden with
100.448	in that moment and for the weeks to come.
103.868	But wanting to find a way
103.868	to condense these feelings
106.516	into something ordered
106.516	that I could work through,
108.862	I decided to do what
108.862	felt most natural to me:
111.322	I wrote about it.
113.149	It started out as a cathartic exercise.
115.606	I wrote a letter to my assaulter,
118.688	"humanizing him as ""you,"""
120.807	to identify him as part
120.807	of the very community
123.708	that he had so violently
123.708	abused that night.
126.991	Stressing the tidal-wave
126.991	effect of his actions,
129.289	I wrote:
130.92	"""Did you ever think"
130.92	of the people in your life?
133.841	I don't know who the people
133.841	in your life are.
136.202	I don't know anything about you.
138.183	But I do know this:
139.839	you did not just attack me that night.
142.323	I'm a daughter, I'm a friend,
143.86	I'm a sister, I'm a pupil,
145.569	I'm a cousin, I'm a niece,
146.895	I'm a neighbor;
148.086	I'm the employee
148.086	who served everyone coffee
150.159	in the caf√© under the railway.
152.362	And all the people who form
152.362	these relations to me
154.872	make up my community.
156.549	And you assaulted
156.549	every single one of them.
159.418	You violated the truth that I
159.418	will never cease to fight for,
162.278	and which all of these people represent:
164.239	that there are infinitely more
164.239	"good people in the world than bad."""
168.79	But, determined not to let
168.79	this one incident make me lose faith
171.813	in the solidarity in my community
171.813	or humanity as a whole,
174.55	I recalled the 7/7 terrorist bombings
174.55	in July 2005 on London transport,
179.052	and how the mayor of London at the time,
179.052	and indeed my own parents,
182.476	had insisted that we all get back
182.476	on the tubes the next day,
185.347	so we wouldn't be defined or changed
187.134	by those that had made us feel unsafe.
189.49	I told my attacker,
191.74	"""You've carried out your attack,"
193.313	but now I'm getting back on my tube.
196.162	My community will not feel we are unsafe
196.162	walking home after dark.
199.453	We will get on the last tubes home,
201.18	and we will walk up our streets alone,
203.038	because we will not ingrain
203.038	or submit to the idea
205.398	that we are putting ourselves
205.398	in danger in doing so.
208.19	We will continue
208.19	to come together, like an army,
210.814	when any member
210.814	of our community is threatened.
213.785	"And this is a fight you will not win."""
217.621	At the time of writing this letter --
219.452	(Applause)
220.851	Thank you.
222.02	(Applause)
224.717	At the time of writing this letter,
226.461	I was studying for my exams in Oxford,
228.34	and I was working
228.34	on the local student paper there.
230.748	Despite being lucky enough to have
230.748	friends and family supporting me,
234.072	it was an isolating time.
235.304	I didn't know anyone
235.304	who'd been through this before;
237.815	at least I didn't think I did.
239.283	I'd read news reports, statistics,
239.283	and knew how common sexual assault was,
242.801	yet I couldn't actually name
242.801	a single person
244.882	that I'd heard speak out
244.882	about an experience of this kind before.
247.989	So in a somewhat spontaneous decision,
249.95	I decided that I would publish
249.95	my letter in the student paper,
252.97	hoping to reach out to others in Oxford
254.902	that might have had a similar experience
254.902	and be feeling the same way.
258.297	At the end of the letter,
259.547	I asked others to write in
259.547	with their experiences
261.937	"under the hashtag, ""#NotGuilty,"""
263.653	to emphasize that survivors of assault
263.653	could express themselves
266.703	without feeling shame or guilt
266.703	about what happened to them --
269.633	to show that we could all
269.633	stand up to sexual assault.
272.233	What I never anticipated
272.233	is that almost overnight,
275.089	this published letter would go viral.
277.619	Soon, we were receiving
277.619	hundreds of stories
280.169	from men and women across the world,
281.976	which we began to publish
281.976	on a website I set up.
284.672	And the hashtag became a campaign.
287.652	There was an Australian mother in her 40s
287.652	who described how on an evening out,
291.366	she was followed to the bathroom
292.946	by a man who went
292.946	to repeatedly grab her crotch.
295.296	There was a man in the Netherlands
296.942	who described how he was date-raped
296.942	on a visit to London
299.658	and wasn't taken seriously
299.658	by anyone he reported his case to.
302.564	I had personal Facebook messages
302.564	from people in India and South America,
306.022	saying, how can we bring
306.022	the message of the campaign there?
309.173	One of the first contributions we had
309.173	was from a woman called Nikki,
311.995	who described growing up,
311.995	being molested my her own father.
314.836	And I had friends open up to me
316.343	about experiences ranging
316.343	from those that happened last week
319.46	to those that happened years ago,
319.46	that I'd had no idea about.
323.326	And the more we started
323.326	to receive these messages,
325.709	the more we also started
325.709	to receive messages of hope --
328.317	people feeling empowered
328.317	by this community of voices
330.816	standing up to sexual assault
330.816	and victim-blaming.
333.344	One woman called Olivia,
334.667	after describing how she was attacked
336.476	by someone she had trusted
336.476	and cared about for a long time,
339.326	"said, ""I've read many"
339.326	of the stories posted here,
341.748	and I feel hopeful that if so many
341.748	women can move forward,
344.762	then I can, too.
345.968	I've been inspired by many,
347.299	and I hope I can be as strong
347.299	as them someday.
349.516	"I'm sure I will."""
351.082	People around the world began
351.082	tweeting under this hashtag,
353.832	and the letter was republished
353.832	and covered by the national press,
356.933	as well as being translated into several
356.933	other languages worldwide.
360.642	But something struck me
360.642	about the media attention
363.04	that this letter was attracting.
364.675	For something to be front-page news,
366.777	"given the word ""news"" itself,"
369.768	we can assume it must be something new
369.768	or something surprising.
373.172	And yet sexual assault
373.172	is not something new.
375.87	Sexual assault, along with other
375.87	kinds of injustices,
378.755	is reported in the media all the time.
381.154	But through the campaign,
382.376	these injustices were framed
382.376	as not just news stories,
385.007	they were firsthand experiences
385.007	that had affected real people,
388.349	who were creating,
388.349	with the solidarity of others,
390.723	what they needed
390.723	and had previously lacked:
392.838	a platform to speak out,
394.259	the reassurance they weren't alone
394.259	or to blame for what happened to them
397.735	and open discussions that would help
397.735	to reduce stigma around the issue.
401.388	The voices of those directly affected
401.388	were at the forefront of the story --
405.08	not the voices of journalists
405.08	or commentators on social media.
408.733	And that's why the story was news.
412.239	We live in an incredibly
412.239	interconnected world
414.37	with the proliferation of social media,
416.294	which is of course a fantastic resource
416.294	for igniting social change.
419.951	But it's also made us
419.951	increasingly reactive,
422.702	from the smallest annoyances
422.702	"of, ""Oh, my train's been delayed,"""
426.113	to the greatest injustices of war,
426.113	genocides, terrorist attacks.
430.508	Our default response has become
430.508	to leap to react to any kind of grievance
434.03	by tweeting, Facebooking, hastagging --
436.202	anything to show others
436.202	that we, too, have reacted.
439.798	The problem with reacting
439.798	in this manner en masse
442.135	is it can sometimes mean
442.135	that we don't actually react at all,
445.08	not in the sense of actually
445.08	doing anything, anyway.
447.553	It might make ourselves feel better,
449.315	like we've contributed
449.315	to a group mourning or outrage,
451.89	but it doesn't actually change anything.
453.876	And what's more,
455.064	it can sometimes drown out the voices
456.892	of those directly
456.892	affected by the injustice,
459.014	whose needs must be heard.
461.78	Worrying, too, is the tendency
461.78	for some reactions to injustice
465.657	to build even more walls,
467.278	being quick to point fingers
467.278	with the hope of providing easy solutions
470.664	to complex problems.
472.328	One British tabloid,
472.328	on the publication of my letter,
474.891	branded a headline stating,
476.444	"""Oxford Student Launches"
476.444	"Online Campaign to Shame Attacker."""
481.567	But the campaign never
481.567	meant to shame anyone.
484.237	It meant to let people speak
484.237	and to make others listen.
488.186	Divisive Twitter trolls were quick
488.186	to create even more injustice,
491.624	commenting on
491.624	my attacker's ethnicity or class
494.598	to push their own prejudiced agendas.
497.381	And some even accused me
497.381	of feigning the whole thing
500.866	to push, and I quote,
502.996	"my ""feminist agenda of man-hating."""
506.834	(Laughter)
507.92	I know, right?
509.104	As if I'm going to be like,
509.104	"""Hey guys! Sorry I can't make it,"
511.993	I'm busy trying to hate
511.993	the entire male population
514.382	"by the time I'm 30."""
515.791	(Laughter)
516.953	Now, I'm almost sure
519.025	that these people wouldn't say
519.025	the things they say in person.
522.021	But it's as if because they might
522.021	be behind a screen,
524.807	in the comfort in their own home
526.39	when on social media,
527.565	people forget that what
527.565	they're doing is a public act --
530.243	that other people will be reading it
530.243	and be affected by it.
533.043	Returning to my analogy
533.043	of getting back on our trains,
536.64	another main concern I have
536.64	about this noise that escalates
539.497	from our online responses to injustice
541.397	is that it can very easily slip
541.397	into portraying us as the affected party,
544.896	which can lead to a sense of defeatism,
546.94	a kind of mental barrier to seeing
546.94	any opportunity for positivity or change
550.683	after a negative situation.
553.092	A couple of months
553.092	before the campaign started
555.351	or any of this happened to me,
556.816	I went to a TEDx event in Oxford,
558.586	and I saw Zelda la Grange speak,
560.545	the former private secretary
560.545	to Nelson Mandela.
562.83	One of the stories
562.83	she told really struck me.
565.755	She spoke of when
565.755	Mandela was taken to court
567.848	by the South African Rugby Union
569.462	after he commissioned
569.462	an inquiry into sports affairs.
572.037	In the courtroom,
573.212	he went up to the South African
573.212	Rugby Union's lawyers,
576.227	shook them by the hand
577.411	and conversed with them,
577.411	each in their own language.
579.878	And Zelda wanted to protest,
581.242	saying they had no right to his respect
583.173	after this injustice they had caused him.
585.837	He turned to her and said,
588.324	"""You must never allow the enemy"
588.324	"to determine the grounds for battle."""
593.9	At the time of hearing these words,
595.634	I didn't really know why
595.634	they were so important,
597.926	but I felt they were, and I wrote them
597.926	down in a notebook I had on me.
601.311	But I've thought about this line
601.311	a lot ever since.
604.198	Revenge, or the expression of hatred
606.739	towards those who have done us injustice
608.699	may feel like a human instinct
608.699	in the face of wrong,
611.737	but we need to break out of these cycles
613.675	if we are to hope to transform
613.675	negative events of injustice
616.807	into positive social change.
618.906	To do otherwise
620.103	continues to let the enemy
620.103	determine the grounds for battle,
623.406	creates a binary,
624.616	where we who have suffered
624.616	become the affected,
627.144	pitted against them, the perpetrators.
630.143	And just like we got back on our tubes,
632.037	we can't let our platforms
632.037	for interconnectivity and community
635.097	be the places that we settle for defeat.
639.072	But I don't want to discourage
639.072	a social media response,
642.612	because I owe the development
642.612	of the #NotGuilty campaign
645.303	almost entirely to social media.
646.871	But I do want to encourage
646.871	a more considered approach
649.42	to the way we use it
649.42	to respond to injustice.
651.567	The start, I think,
651.567	is to ask ourselves two things.
654.042	Firstly: Why do I feel this injustice?
656.598	In my case, there were
656.598	several answers to this.
658.928	Someone had hurt me and those who I loved,
661.185	under the assumption they
661.185	wouldn't have to be held to account
664.109	or recognize the damage they had caused.
666.046	Not only that, but thousands
666.046	of men and women suffer every day
668.978	from sexual abuse, often in silence,
670.72	yet it's still a problem we don't give
670.72	the same airtime to as other issues.
674.296	It's still an issue many people
674.296	blame victims for.
676.84	Next, ask yourself: How,
676.84	in recognizing these reasons,
680.146	could I go about reversing them?
682.183	With us, this was holding my attacker
682.183	to account -- and many others.
685.795	It was calling them out
685.795	on the effect they had caused.
688.425	It was giving airtime
688.425	to the issue of sexual assault,
691.183	opening up discussions amongst friends,
691.183	amongst families, in the media
694.568	that had been closed for too long,
696.233	and stressing that victims
696.233	shouldn't feel to blame
698.614	for what happened to them.
699.909	We might still have a long way to go
699.909	in solving this problem entirely.
703.251	But in this way,
704.426	we can begin to use social media
704.426	as an active tool for social justice,
707.761	as a tool to educate,
707.761	to stimulate dialogues,
709.883	to make those in positions
709.883	of authority aware of an issue
712.592	by listening to those
712.592	directly affected by it.
716.112	Because sometimes these questions
716.112	don't have easy answers.
720.606	In fact, they rarely do.
722.715	But this doesn't mean we still
722.715	can't give them a considered response.
726.37	In situations where
726.37	you can't go about thinking
728.598	how you'd reverse
728.598	this feeling of injustice,
730.717	you can still think,
730.717	maybe not what you can do,
733.395	but what you can not do.
735.681	You can not build further walls
735.681	by fighting injustice with more prejudice,
739.397	more hatred.
740.894	You can not speak over those
740.894	directly affected by an injustice.
745.121	And you can not react to injustice,
745.121	only to forget about it the next day,
749.124	just because the rest
749.124	of Twitter has moved on.
752.078	Sometimes not reacting
752.078	instantly is, ironically,
756.289	the best immediate course
756.289	of action we can take.
759.919	Because we might be angry, upset
759.919	and energized by injustice,
764.219	but let's consider our responses.
767.413	Let us hold people to account,
767.413	without descending into a culture
770.673	that thrives off shaming
770.673	and injustice ourselves.
774.345	Let us remember that distinction,
776.016	so often forgotten by internet users,
778.238	between criticism and insult.
781.33	Let us not forget
781.33	to think before we speak,
783.37	just because we might
783.37	have a screen in front of us.
785.811	And when we create noise on social media,
787.806	let it not drown out the needs
787.806	of those affected,
790.148	but instead let it amplify their voices,
792.613	so the internet becomes a place
792.613	where you're not the exception
795.579	if you speak out about something
795.579	that has actually happened to you.
798.771	All these considered
798.771	approaches to injustice
800.848	evoke the very keystones
800.848	on which the internet was built:
804.317	to network, to have signal, to connect --
806.596	all these terms that imply
806.596	bringing people together,
809.112	not pushing people apart.
811.443	Because if you look up the word
811.443	"""justice"" in the dictionary,"
815.977	before punishment,
817.267	before administration of law
817.267	or judicial authority,
821.529	you get:
822.799	"""The maintenance of what is right."""
825.794	And I think there are few things
825.794	"more ""right"" in this world"
829.584	than bringing people together,
831.344	than unions.
833.395	And if we allow social media
833.395	to deliver that,
835.916	then it can deliver a very powerful
835.916	form of justice, indeed.
840.477	Thank you very much.
841.73	(Applause)
