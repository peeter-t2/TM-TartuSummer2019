31	I just want to say, over the last few years I've been --
35	had the opportunity to do this closing conference.
38	And I've had some incredible warm-up acts.
43	About eight years ago,
45	Billy Graham opened for me.
47	And I thought that there was --
49	(Laughter)
50	I thought that there was absolutely no way
53	in hell to top that.
55	But I just wanted to say --
58	and I mean this without irony --
60	I think I can speak for everybody in the audience
64	when I say that I wish to God that you were the President of the United States.
68	(Applause)
74	OK, this is the title of my talk today.
77	(Laughter)
81	I just want to give you a quick overview.
84	First of all, please remember I'm completely politically correct,
87	and I mean everything with great affection.
89	If any of you have sensitive stomachs or are feeling queasy,
92	now is the time to check your Blackberry.
94	(Laughter)
96	Just to review, this is my TEDTalk.
100	We're going to do some jokes,
102	some gags,
106	some little skits --
108	and then we're going to talk about the L1 point.
110	(Laughter)
113	So, one of the questions I ask myself
116	is, was this the most distressing TED ever?
119	Let's try and sum things up, shall we?
122	Images of limb regeneration
124	and faces filled with smallpox:
127	(Laughter)
129	Mentions of polar bears drowning: four percent.
133	Images of the earth being wiped out by flood or bird flu: 64 percent.
137	(Laughter)
138	And David Pogue singing show tunes.
141	(Applause)
143	Because this is the most distressing TED ever,
145	I've been working with Neil Gershenfeld on next year's TED Bag.
148	And if the -- if the conference is anywhere near this distressing,
151	then we're going to have a scream bag next year.
153	(Laughter)
157	It's going to be a cradle-to-cradle scream bag, of course.
159	(Laughter)
161	So you're going to be able to go like this.
164	(Laughter)
168	Bring it over here
173	and open it up. Aaaah!
175	(Laughter)
184	Meanwhile, back at TED University,
187	this wonderful woman is teaching you how to chop Sun Chips.
190	(Laughter)
198	So Robert Wright -- I don't know,
201	I felt like if there was anyone that Helen needed to give antidepressants to,
204	it might have been him.
205	I want to deliberately interfere with his dopamine levels.
208	(Laughter)
209	He was talking about morality.
212	Economy class morality is,
214	we want to bomb you back to the Stone Age.
216	Business class morality is,
218	don't bomb Japan -- they built my car.
220	And first-class morality is, don't bomb Mexico -- they clean my house.
224	(Laughter)
226	Yes, it is politically incorrect.
230	All right,
232	now I want to do a little bit of a thing for you ...
234	(Laughter)
240	All right, now these are the wha --
242	I'd say, [mumble, mumble --
245	mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble,
248	mumble] -- ahh!
252	(Laughter)
255	So I wanted to show you guys --
257	I wanted to talk about a revolutionary new computer interface
260	that lets you work with images just as easily
265	as you -- as a completely natural user interface.
267	(Laughter)
272	And you can --
273	you can use really natural hand gestures
275	to like, go like this.
277	(Applause)
283	Now we had a Harvard professor here --
285	she was from Harvard, I just wanted to mention and --
287	and she was actually a professor from Harvard.
291	And she was talking about seven-dimensional, inverted universes.
295	With, you know, of course, there's the gravity brain.
297	There's the weak brain. And then there's my weak brain,
300	which is too -- too -- absolutely too weak to understand
302	what the fuck she was talking about.
304	(Laughter)
306	Now --
308	(Laughter)
313	one of the things that is very important to me
315	is to try and figure out what on Earth am I here for.
319	And that's why I went out
320	and I picked up a best-selling business book.
322	You know, it basically uses as its central premise Greek mythology.
326	And it's by a guy named Pastor Rick Warren,
329	and it's called
331	"""The Porpoise Driven Life."""
333	(Laughter)
336	And Rick is as
339	a pagan god,
341	which I thought was kind of appropriate,
343	in a certain way.
345	And now we're going to have kind of
347	a little more visualization about Rick Warren.
356	OK.
359	(Laughter)
366	All right.
369	Now, red is Rick Warren,
371	and green is Daniel Dennett, OK?
374	(Laughter)
377	The scales here are religiosity from zero percent,
381	or atheist, to 100 percent, Bible literally true.
384	And then this is books sold -- the logarithmic scale.
388	(Laughter)
395	OK, now they're duking it out. Now they're duking it out.
397	(Laughter)
399	And Rick Warren's kind of pulling ahead, kind of pulling ahead.
401	Yup, and his installed base is getting a little bigger.
405	(Laughter)
410	But Darwin's dangerous idea is coming back. It's coming back.
414	Let me turn the trails on, so you can see that a little bit better.
416	(Laughter)
423	(Applause)
429	Now, one of the things that's very important is,
431	Nicholas Negroponte talked to us about one lap dance per --
433	I'm sorry --
434	(Laughter)
443	about One Laptop Per Child.
445	Now let's talk about some of the characteristics
447	that are important for this revolutionary device.
449	I'll tell you a little bit about the design parameters,
451	and then I'll show it to you in person.
453	First of all, it needs to be small.
455	It needs to be flat, so it's transportable.
457	Lightweight. Portable.
459	Uses very, very little power.
461	Very, very high resolution.
463	Has to be visible in bright daylight. Will work anywhere.
466	And broadly applicable across many platforms.
469	Now, we've actually done some research --
471	Neil Gershenfeld and the Fab Labs went out into the market.
474	They did some research; we came back; and we think we have the perfect prototype
478	of what the students in the field are actually asking for.
482	And here it is,
484	the $100 computer.
486	(Laughter)
493	OK, OK, OK, OK -- excellent, excellent.
499	Now, I bought this device from Clifford Stoll for about 900 bucks.
503	And he and his team of junior-high school students
506	were doing real science.
508	So we're trying to check and trying to douse here,
510	and see who uses marijuana.
512	(Laughter)
513	See who uses marijuana.
515	Are we going to be able to find any marijuana, Jim Young?
518	Only if we open enough locker doors.
521	(Laughter)
524	OK, now smallpox is an extremely distressing illness.
528	We had Dr. Larry Brilliant talking about how we eradicated smallpox.
532	I wanted to show you the stages of smallpox.
535	We start. This is day one.
537	(Laughter)
540	Day two.
542	Day three, she gets a massively big pox on her shoulder.
546	Day three.
548	Day four.
550	(Laughter)
551	Day five
553	and day six.
555	(Laughter)
556	Now the good news is, because I'm a trained medical professional,
559	I know that even though she'll be scarred for life,
561	she's going to make a full recovery.
563	(Laughter)
570	Now the good news about Architects for Humanity
573	is they're really kind of the most amazing group.
576	They've been sponsoring a design competition
578	to come up with innovative medical housing solutions,
580	clinic solutions, in Africa,
582	and they've had a design competition.
585	Now the wonderful thing is, Larry Brilliant was just appointed
588	the head of the Google Foundation,
590	and so he decided that he would support --
593	he would support Cameron's work.
595	And the way he decided to support that work
598	was by shipping over 50,000 shipping containers
600	of Google snacks.
602	(Laughter)
604	So I want to show you some prototypes.
611	The U.N. -- you know, they took 20 years just to add a flap to a tent,
614	but I think we have some more exciting things.
617	This is a home made entirely out of Fruit Roll-Ups.
620	(Laughter)
623	(Applause)
629	And those roll-up cookies coated with white chocolate.
632	And the really wonderful thing about this is,
634	when you're done, well --
636	you can eat it.
639	But the thing that I'm really, really excited about
642	is this incredible granola house.
644	(Laughter)
645	And the granola house has a special Sun Chip roof
648	to collect water and recycle it.
650	And it's -- well, on this side it has regular Sour Patch Kids
654	and Gummy Bears to let in the light.
656	(Laughter)
657	But on this side, it has sugary Gummy Bears,
659	to diffuse the light more slightly.
662	And we -- we wanted just to show you what this might look like in situ.
666	(Laughter)
670	(Applause)
677	So, Einstein --
680	Einstein, tell me --
683	what's your favorite song?
686	No, I said what's your favorite song?
691	No, I said what's your favorite song?
694	"""Free Bird."""
696	(Laughter)
699	(Applause)
705	OK, so, Einstein,
708	what's your favorite singing group?
713	Could you say that again? What's your favorite singing group?
719	OK, one more time -- I'm just going to give you a little help.
721	Your favorite singing group -- it's Diana Ross and the --
725	Audience: Supremes!
726	Tom Reilly: Exactly.
728	(Applause)
736	Could we have the sound up on the laptop, please?
738	(Laughter)
740	"""Free Bird"" kind of reminds me that if you --"
741	"if you listen to ""Free Bird"" backwards,"
743	this is what you might hear.
746	Computer: Satan. Satan. Satan. Satan.
752	Satan. Satan. Satan.
755	TR: Now it's a little hard to hear the whole message, so I wanted to --
757	(Laughter)
759	so I wanted to help you a little bit.
767	Computer: My sweet Satan. Dan Dennett worships Satan.
771	"Buy ""The Purpose-Driven Life,"" or Satan will take your soul."
775	(Laughter)
786	TR: So,
788	we've talked a lot about global warming,
790	but, you know, as Jill said, it sounds kind of nice --
793	good weather in the wintertime, and New York City.
796	And as Jay Walker pointed out, that is just not scary enough.
801	So Al, I actually think I'm rather good at branding.
804	So I've tried to figure out a good design process
807	"to come up with a new term to replace ""global warming."""
810	So we started with Babel Fish. We put in global warming.
814	And then we decided that we'd change it from English to Dutch --
816	"into ""Het globale Verwarmen."""
819	"From Dutch to [Korean], into ""Hordahordaneecheewa."""
822	(Laughter)
823	[Korean] to Portuguese: Aquecer-se Global.
826	Then Portuguese to Pig Latin.
828	(Laughter)
838	Aquecer-se ucked-fay.
840	And then finally back into the English,
843	which is, we're totally fucked.
845	(Laughter)
847	(Applause)
853	Now I don't know about you,
855	but Michael Shermer talked about the willingness for human beings --
858	evolutionarily, they're designed to see patterns in things.
861	For example, in cheese sandwiches.
864	Now can you look at that carefully and see if you see the Virgin Mary?
868	I tried to make it a little bit clearer.
870	(Laughter)
874	Is it the Virgin Mary?
876	Or is it Mena Trott?
881	So, I talked to Josh Prince-Ramus about the convention center
883	and the conferences. It's getting awfully big.
885	It's getting just a little bit too big. It's bursting at the seams here a little bit.
888	So we tried to come up with a program --
890	how we could remake this structure to better accommodate TED.
893	So first of all we decided --
895	(Laughter)
896	that we needed about one-third bookstore,
898	one-third Google cafe,
900	about 20 percent registration, 80 percent luxury hotel,
903	about five percent for restrooms.
905	And then of course, we wanted to have the simulcast lounge,
907	the lobby and the Steinbeck forum.
908	Now let me show you how that
910	literally translated into the design program.
913	So first,
915	one of the problems with Monterey is that if there is global warming
917	and Greenland melts as you say, the ocean level
919	is going to rise 20 feet and flood the hell out of the convention center.
923	So we're going to build this new building on stilts.
925	So we build this building on stilts,
927	then up here --
929	(Laughter)
930	is where we're going to put the new Steinbeck auditorium.
932	(Laughter)
933	And the wonderful thing about the new bookstore is,
936	it's going to be shaped in a spiral that's organized by the Dewey Decimal System.
940	(Laughter)
942	Then we're going to make an escalator that helps you get up there.
945	And finally, we're going to put the Marriott Hotel
948	and the Portola Plaza on the top.
950	(Applause)
954	Now I don't know about you, but sometimes I have these images in my head
957	of separated at birth.
959	I don't know about you, but when I see Aubrey de Grey,
962	I immediately go to Gandalf the Grey.
965	(Laughter)
969	OK. Now, we've heard, of course,
971	that we're all soldiers here.
974	So what I'd really, really like you to do now is,
976	pick up your white piece of paper. Does everybody have their white piece of paper?
980	And I want you to get out a pen,
983	and I want you to write a terrorist note.
985	(Laughter)
988	If we put up the ELMO for a moment --
991	if we put up the ELMO, then we'll get, you know,
993	I'll give you a model that you can work from, OK?
997	(Laughter)
999	And then I want you to fold that note into a paper airplane.
1004	And once you've folded it into a paper airplane,
1006	I want you to take some anthrax --
1008	(Laughter)
1010	and I want you to put that in the paper airplane.
1013	And then I want you to throw it on Jim Young.
1015	(Laughter)
1018	Luckily, I was the recipient of the TED Prize this year.
1022	And I wanted to see --
1024	I want to dedicate this film to my father, Homer.
1027	OK.
1035	Now this film isn't really hard enough,
1037	so I wanted to make it a little bit harder.
1039	So I'm going to try and do this while reciting pi.
1041	(Laughter)
1042	3.1415,
1055	-- 85871, 25871,
1069	(Applause)
1076	Can we cue the music please?
1094	(Applause)
1105	Now I wanted to use this talk to talk about global warming a little bit.
1110	Back in 1968,
1112	you can see that the mountain range of Brokeback Mountain
1115	was covered in 151 inches of snow pack.
1120	Parenthetically, over there on the slopes,
1122	I did want to show you that black men ski.
1126	(Laughter)
1132	But over the years,
1137	and, if you notice, the trees have started turning yellow.
1139	The water level of the lake has started drying up.
1144	A few years later, there's no snow left at all.
1147	And all the trees have turned brown.
1151	This year, unfortunately the lakebed's
1153	turned into an absolute cracked dry bed.
1156	And I fear, if we do nothing for our planet,
1159	in 20 years, it's going to look like this.
1164	(Laughter)
1177	Mr. Vice President, I wish I knew how to quit you.
1182	(Laughter)
1183	(Applause)
1187	Thank you very much.
1188	(Applause)
