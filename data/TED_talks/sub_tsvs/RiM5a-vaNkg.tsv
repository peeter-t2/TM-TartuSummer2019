12.873	As a student of adversity,
16.309	I've been struck over the years
16.309	by how some people with major challenges
21.641	seem to draw strength from them.
24.649	And I've heard the popular wisdom
24.649	that that has to do with finding meaning.
28.94	And for a long time,
30.425	I thought the meaning was out there,
32.824	some great truth waiting to be found.
35.985	But over time,
37.64	I've come to feel
37.64	that the truth is irrelevant.
40.593	"We call it ""finding meaning,"""
42.8	but we might better call
42.8	"it ""forging meaning."""
46.983	My last book was about
46.983	how families manage to deal
49.952	with various kinds of challenging
49.952	or unusual offspring.
54.303	And one of the mothers I interviewed,
56.494	who had two children
56.494	with multiple severe disabilities,
59.481	"said to me, ""People always give us"
59.481	these little sayings like,
64.202	'God doesn't give you
64.202	any more than you can handle.'
67.789	But children like ours
67.789	are not preordained as a gift.
73.145	They're a gift
74.32	"because that's what we have chosen."""
78.68	We make those choices all our lives.
83.351	When I was in second grade,
85.419	Bobby Finkel had a birthday party
88.3	and invited everyone in our class but me.
92.637	My mother assumed
92.637	there had been some sort of error,
95.155	and she called Mrs. Finkel,
96.817	who said that Bobby didn't like me
96.817	and didn't want me at his party.
102.022	And that day, my mom took me to the zoo
105.243	and out for a hot fudge sundae.
108.047	When I was in seventh grade,
109.975	one of the kids on my school bus
109.975	"nicknamed me ""Percy,"""
114.317	as a shorthand for my demeanor.
117.011	And sometimes, he and his cohort
117.011	would chant that provocation
122.083	the entire school bus ride,
127.774	"""Percy! Percy! Percy! Percy!"""
132.572	When I was in eighth grade,
132.572	our science teacher told us
136.777	that all male homosexuals
136.777	develop fecal incontinence
140.825	because of the trauma
140.825	to their anal sphincter.
145.294	And I graduated high school
145.294	without ever going to the cafeteria,
149.941	where I would have sat with the girls
149.941	and been laughed at for doing so,
153.863	or sat with the boys,
155.625	and been laughed at for being a boy
155.625	who should be sitting with the girls.
160.026	I survived that childhood
160.026	through a mix of avoidance and endurance.
165.801	What I didn't know then
167.579	and do know now,
169.079	is that avoidance and endurance
169.079	can be the entryway to forging meaning.
176.366	After you've forged meaning,
178.533	you need to incorporate that meaning
178.533	into a new identity.
182.921	You need to take the traumas
184.801	and make them part
184.801	of who you've come to be,
188.1	and you need to fold
188.1	the worst events of your life
191.112	into a narrative of triumph,
193.32	evincing a better self
193.32	in response to things that hurt.
198.493	One of the other mothers I interviewed
198.493	when I was working on my book
202.819	had been raped as an adolescent,
205.168	and had a child following that rape,
208.183	which had thrown away her career plans
211.087	and damaged all
211.087	of her emotional relationships.
215.073	But when I met her, she was 50,
218.06	and I said to her,
219.462	"""Do you often think"
219.462	"about the man who raped you?"""
222.232	"And she said, ""I used to think"
222.232	about him with anger,
226.908	"but now only with pity."""
229.387	And I thought she meant pity
229.387	because he was so unevolved
232.044	as to have done this terrible thing.
234.576	"And I said, ""Pity?"""
236.343	"And she said, ""Yes,"
238.033	because he has a beautiful daughter
238.033	and two beautiful grandchildren,
243.092	and he doesn't know that,
245.063	and I do.
246.82	So as it turns out,
248.669	"I'm the lucky one."""
252.331	Some of our struggles
252.331	are things we're born to:
255.888	our gender, our sexuality,
255.888	our race, our disability.
261.507	And some are things that happen to us:
263.785	being a political prisoner,
263.785	being a rape victim,
267.383	being a Katrina survivor.
269.9	Identity involves entering a community
272.813	to draw strength from that community,
275.37	and to give strength there, too.
277.981	It involves substituting
277.981	"""and"" for ""but"" --"
282.207	"not ""I am here but I have cancer,"""
286.275	"but rather, ""I have cancer and I am here."""
291.952	When we're ashamed,
291.952	we can't tell our stories,
295.476	and stories are the foundation
298.102	of identity.
300.539	Forge meaning,
302.211	build identity.
304.485	Forge meaning and build identity.
308.058	That became my mantra.
310.213	Forging meaning
310.213	is about changing yourself.
313.801	Building identity
313.801	is about changing the world.
317.619	All of us with stigmatized identities
317.619	face this question daily:
322.096	How much to accommodate society
322.096	by constraining ourselves,
326.659	and how much to break the limits
329.099	of what constitutes a valid life?
332.41	Forging meaning and building identity
335.514	does not make what was wrong right.
338.499	It only makes what was wrong precious.
343.094	In January of this year,
345.221	I went to Myanmar
345.221	to interview political prisoners,
349.384	and I was surprised to find them
349.384	less bitter than I'd anticipated.
353.863	Most of them had knowingly
353.863	committed the offenses
356.427	that landed them in prison,
358.268	and they had walked in
358.268	with their heads held high,
361.747	and they walked out
361.747	with their heads still held high,
365.812	many years later.
367.897	Dr. Ma Thida, a leading
367.897	human rights activist
371.333	who had nearly died in prison
372.761	and had spent many years
372.761	in solitary confinement,
375.815	told me she was grateful to her jailers
375.815	for the time she had had to think,
381.795	for the wisdom she had gained,
383.921	for the chance to hone
383.921	her meditation skills.
387.861	She had sought meaning
389.429	and made her travail
389.429	into a crucial identity.
393.458	But if the people I met
393.458	were less bitter than I'd anticipated
397.323	about being in prison,
398.884	they were also less thrilled
398.884	than I'd expected
401.749	about the reform process
401.749	going on in their country.
405.343	Ma Thida said,
406.956	"""We Burmese are noted"
406.956	for our tremendous grace under pressure,
411.936	"but we also have grievance under glamour."""
416.587	"She said, ""And the fact that there"
416.587	have been these shifts and changes
420.328	doesn't erase the continuing
420.328	problems in our society
424.189	that we learned to see so well
424.189	"while we were in prison."""
428.385	I understood her to be saying
430.545	that concessions confer
430.545	only a little humanity
434.096	where full humanity is due;
436.355	that crumbs are not the same
436.355	as a place at the table.
440.598	Which is to say,
441.942	you can forge meaning and build identity
445.096	and still be mad as hell.
449.539	I've never been raped,
451.204	and I've never been in anything
451.204	remotely approaching a Burmese prison.
456.214	But as a gay American,
458.071	I've experienced prejudice
458.071	and even hatred,
462.284	and I've forged meaning
464.422	and I've built identity,
466.648	which is a move I learned from people
468.996	who had experienced far worse privation
468.996	than I've ever known.
474.082	In my own adolescence,
475.931	I went to extreme lengths
475.931	to try to be straight.
479.241	I enrolled myself in something called
479.241	"""sexual surrogacy therapy,"""
483.482	in which people
483.482	I was encouraged to call doctors
487.168	prescribed what I was encouraged
487.168	to call exercises
491.12	with women I was encouraged
491.12	to call surrogates,
494.685	who were not exactly prostitutes
497.25	but who were also
497.25	not exactly anything else.
500.175	(Laughter)
504.443	My particular favorite
504.443	was a blonde woman from the Deep South
508.68	who eventually admitted to me
508.68	that she was really a necrophiliac,
512.731	and had taken this job
512.731	after she got in trouble
515.534	down at the morgue.
517.007	(Laughter)
523.704	These experiences eventually
523.704	allowed me to have
526.707	some happy physical
526.707	relationships with women,
529.548	for which I'm grateful.
531.175	But I was at war with myself,
533.665	and I dug terrible wounds
533.665	into my own psyche.
538.544	We don't seek the painful experiences
541.763	that hew our identities,
544.066	but we seek our identities
546.17	in the wake of painful experiences.
549.643	We cannot bear a pointless torment,
552.529	but we can endure great pain
555.029	if we believe that it's purposeful.
557.972	Ease makes less of an impression on us
560.46	than struggle.
561.856	We could have been ourselves
561.856	without our delights,
564.688	but not without the misfortunes
564.688	that drive our search for meaning.
569.728	"""Therefore, I take"
569.728	"pleasure in infirmities,"""
573.191	St. Paul wrote in Second Corinthians,
575.856	"""for when I am weak, then I am strong."""
580.09	In 1988, I went to Moscow
580.09	to interview artists
584.379	of the Soviet underground.
586.047	I expected their work
586.047	to be dissident and political.
590.373	But the radicalism in their work
592.498	actually lay in reinserting
592.498	humanity into a society
596.358	that was annihilating humanity itself,
598.972	as, in some senses,
598.972	Russian society is now doing again.
603.234	One of the artists I met said to me,
605.822	"""We were in training to be"
605.822	"not artists but angels."""
610.129	In 1991, I went back to see
610.129	the artists I'd been writing about,
614.764	and I was with them during the putsch
614.764	that ended the Soviet Union.
619.09	And they were among the chief organizers
619.09	of the resistance to that putsch.
623.98	And on the third day of the putsch,
627.4	one of them suggested
627.4	we walk up to Smolenskaya.
630.613	And we went there,
632.045	and we arranged ourselves
632.045	in front of one of the barricades,
635.265	and a little while later,
636.736	a column of tanks rolled up.
638.895	And the soldier on the front tank said,
641.21	"""We have unconditional orders"
641.21	to destroy this barricade.
645.381	If you get out of the way,
645.381	we don't need to hurt you.
648.039	But if you won't move, we'll have
648.039	"no choice but to run you down."""
651.831	The artist I was with said,
651.831	"""Give us just a minute."
655.326	Give us just a minute
655.326	"to tell you why we're here."""
659.381	And the soldier folded his arms,
661.495	and the artist launched into
661.495	a Jeffersonian panegyric to democracy
666.094	such as those of us who live
666.094	in a Jeffersonian democracy
669.873	would be hard-pressed to present.
672.905	And they went on and on,
674.844	and the soldier watched.
676.808	And then he sat there for a full minute
676.808	after they were finished
680.096	and looked at us,
680.096	so bedraggled in the rain,
682.718	"and said, ""What you have said is true,"
686.844	and we must bow to the will of the people.
690.238	If you'll clear enough space
690.238	for us to turn around,
692.871	"we'll go back the way we came."""
695.272	And that's what they did.
697.102	Sometimes, forging meaning
697.102	can give you the vocabulary you need
702.1	to fight for your ultimate freedom.
705.254	Russia awakened me to the lemonade notion
708.114	that oppression breeds
708.114	the power to oppose it.
710.995	And I gradually understood that
710.995	as the cornerstone of identity.
716.496	It took identity
716.496	to rescue me from sadness.
720.576	The gay rights movement posits a world
722.875	in which my aberrances are a victory.
725.915	Identity politics
725.915	always works on two fronts:
729.354	to give pride to people who have
729.354	a given condition or characteristic,
733.957	and to cause the outside world
733.957	to treat such people
736.816	more gently and more kindly.
739.201	Those are two totally
739.201	separate enterprises,
742.482	but progress in each sphere
742.482	reverberates in the other.
746.613	Identity politics can be narcissistic.
750.29	People extol a difference
750.29	only because it's theirs.
753.849	People narrow the world
753.849	and function in discrete groups
757.168	without empathy for one another.
759.546	But properly understood
759.546	and wisely practiced,
763.517	identity politics should expand
763.517	our idea of what it is to be human.
768.223	Identity itself should be
768.223	not a smug label or a gold medal,
774.617	but a revolution.
776.848	I would have had an easier life
776.848	if I were straight,
780.47	but I would not be me.
782.182	And I now like being myself better
784.883	than the idea of being someone else,
787.017	someone who, to be honest,
788.666	I have neither the option of being
788.666	nor the ability fully to imagine.
793.257	But if you banish the dragons,
793.257	you banish the heroes,
797.879	and we become attached
797.879	to the heroic strain in our own lives.
802.428	I've sometimes wondered
803.829	whether I could have ceased
803.829	to hate that part of myself
806.612	without gay pride's technicolor fiesta,
809.469	of which this speech is one manifestation.
812.139	(Laughter)
813.756	I used to think I would know
813.756	myself to be mature
816.713	when I could simply be gay
816.713	without emphasis.
819.834	But the self-loathing
819.834	of that period left a void,
823.66	and celebration needs
823.66	to fill and overflow it,
826.938	and even if I repay
826.938	my private debt of melancholy,
830.798	there's still an outer world of homophobia
833.713	that it will take decades to address.
836.53	Someday, being gay will be a simple fact,
839.822	free of party hats and blame.
842.678	But not yet.
844.602	A friend of mine who thought gay pride
844.602	was getting very carried away with itself,
848.799	once suggested that we organize
848.799	Gay Humility Week.
852.077	(Laughter)
853.489	(Applause)
858.752	It's a great idea.
859.967	(Laughter)
861.355	But its time has not yet come.
863.206	(Laughter)
865.551	And neutrality, which seems to lie
865.551	halfway between despair and celebration,
870.593	is actually the endgame.
873.388	In 29 states in the US,
876.211	I could legally be fired or denied housing
879.38	for being gay.
881.352	In Russia, the anti-propaganda law
884.119	has led to people being beaten
884.119	in the streets.
887.316	Twenty-seven African countries
887.316	have passed laws against sodomy.
892.191	And in Nigeria, gay people
892.191	can legally be stoned to death,
895.951	and lynchings have become common.
898.578	In Saudi Arabia recently,
900.676	two men who had been caught in carnal acts
903.573	were sentenced to 7,000 lashes each,
908.113	and are now permanently
908.113	disabled as a result.
911.337	So who can forge meaning
913.584	and build identity?
916.118	Gay rights are not primarily
916.118	marriage rights,
919.617	and for the millions who live
919.617	in unaccepting places
922.712	with no resources,
924.581	dignity remains elusive.
927.106	I am lucky to have forged meaning
930.261	and built identity,
932.438	but that's still a rare privilege.
934.821	And gay people deserve more, collectively,
937.548	than the crumbs of justice.
940.714	And yet,
942.141	every step forward is so sweet.
945.815	In 2007, six years after we met,
949.708	my partner and I decided to get married.
953.311	Meeting John had been the discovery
953.311	of great happiness
957.339	and also the elimination
957.339	of great unhappiness.
960.707	And sometimes, I was so occupied
960.707	with the disappearance of all that pain,
965.796	that I forgot about the joy,
968.148	which was at first
968.148	the less remarkable part of it to me.
971.764	Marrying was a way to declare our love
974.395	as more a presence than an absence.
978.451	Marriage soon led us to children,
980.839	and that meant new meanings
982.775	and new identities -- ours and theirs.
986.849	I want my children to be happy,
989.689	and I love them most achingly
989.689	when they are sad.
993.39	As a gay father, I can teach them
993.39	to own what is wrong in their lives,
998.827	but I believe that if I succeed
998.827	in sheltering them from adversity,
1002.94	I will have failed as a parent.
1005.83	A Buddhist scholar I know
1005.83	once explained to me
1008.813	that Westerners mistakenly think
1011.007	that nirvana is what arrives
1011.007	when all your woe is behind you,
1015.909	and you have only bliss
1015.909	to look forward to.
1019.021	But he said that would not be nirvana,
1021.187	because your bliss in the present
1023.212	would always be shadowed
1023.212	by the joy from the past.
1026.6	Nirvana, he said, is what you arrive at
1029.431	when you have only bliss
1029.431	to look forward to
1032.051	and find in what looked like sorrows
1032.051	the seedlings of your joy.
1037.426	And I sometimes wonder
1039.202	whether I could have found
1039.202	such fulfillment in marriage and children
1042.923	if they'd come more readily,
1045.115	if I'd been straight in my youth
1045.115	or were young now,
1049.07	in either of which cases
1049.07	this might be easier.
1052.585	Perhaps I could.
1054.071	Perhaps all the complex
1054.071	imagining I've done
1056.302	could have been applied to other topics.
1058.601	But if seeking meaning
1058.601	matters more than finding meaning,
1062.278	the question is not whether
1062.278	I'd be happier for having been bullied,
1066.875	but whether assigning meaning
1066.875	to those experiences
1070.284	has made me a better father.
1072.878	I tend to find the ecstasy
1072.878	hidden in ordinary joys,
1076.738	because I did not expect those joys
1076.738	to be ordinary to me.
1081.265	I know many heterosexuals who have
1081.265	equally happy marriages and families,
1085.348	but gay marriage
1085.348	is so breathtakingly fresh,
1088.316	and gay families so exhilaratingly new,
1091.657	and I found meaning in that surprise.
1095.772	In October, it was my 50th birthday,
1099.286	and my family organized a party for me.
1102.42	And in the middle of it,
1102.42	my son said to my husband
1105.229	that he wanted to make a speech.
1107	And John said,
1108.182	"""George, you can't make"
1108.182	"a speech. You're four."""
1112.265	(Laughter)
1113.97	"""Only Grandpa and Uncle David and I"
1113.97	"are going to make speeches tonight."""
1118.515	But George insisted and insisted,
1121.134	and finally, John took him
1121.134	up to the microphone,
1124.606	and George said very loudly,
1127.479	"""Ladies and gentlemen!"
1129.923	"May I have your attention, please?"""
1132.419	And everyone turned around, startled.
1135.135	And George said,
1137.327	"""I'm glad it's daddy's birthday."
1139.976	I'm glad we all get cake.
1143.284	And Daddy, if you were little,
1146.312	"I'd be your friend."""
1147.934	(Gasp)
1149.958	And I thought -- (Applause)
1151.988	Thank you.
1153.163	I thought that I was indebted
1153.163	even to Bobby Finkel,
1156.875	because all those earlier experiences
1159.541	were what had propelled me to this moment,
1161.98	and I was finally unconditionally grateful
1164.513	for a life I'd once have done
1164.513	anything to change.
1168.719	The gay activist Harvey Milk
1168.719	was once asked by a younger gay man
1172.98	what he could do to help the movement,
1175.084	and Harvey Milk said,
1176.702	"""Go out and tell someone."""
1179.138	There's always somebody
1179.138	who wants to confiscate our humanity.
1183.011	And there are always
1183.011	stories that restore it.
1185.816	If we live out loud,
1187.395	we can trounce the hatred,
1189.416	and expand everyone's lives.
1192.569	Forge meaning.
1194.222	Build identity.
1196.169	Forge meaning.
1198.393	Build identity.
1201.228	And then invite the world
1201.228	to share your joy.
1204.675	Thank you.
1205.898	(Applause)
1208.94	Thank you.
1210.182	(Applause)
1212.224	Thank you.
1213.427	(Applause)
1216.149	Thank you.
1217.326	(Applause)
