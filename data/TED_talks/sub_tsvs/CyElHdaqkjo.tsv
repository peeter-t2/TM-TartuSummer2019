12.68	You know, I didn't set out
12.68	to be a parenting expert.
16.52	In fact, I'm not very interested
16.52	in parenting, per Se.
21.08	It's just that there's a certain style
21.08	of parenting these days
25.04	that is kind of messing up kids,
28.239	impeding their chances
28.239	to develop into theirselves.
33.32	There's a certain style
33.32	of parenting these days
35.56	that's getting in the way.
36.92	I guess what I'm saying is,
38.56	we spend a lot of time
38.56	being very concerned
40.64	about parents who aren't involved enough
40.64	in the lives of their kids
44.32	and their education or their upbringing,
46.28	and rightly so.
48	But at the other end of the spectrum,
50.4	there's a lot of harm
50.4	going on there as well,
53.12	where parents feel
53.12	a kid can't be successful
56.08	unless the parent is protecting
56.08	and preventing at every turn
60.16	and hovering over every happening,
60.16	and micromanaging every moment,
63.92	and steering their kid towards
63.92	some small subset of colleges and careers.
70.76	When we raise kids this way,
73.4	and I'll say we,
75.12	because Lord knows,
75.12	in raising my two teenagers,
77.92	I've had these tendencies myself,
80.68	our kids end up leading
80.68	a kind of checklisted childhood.
85.2	And here's what the checklisted
85.2	childhood looks like.
87.92	We keep them safe and sound
90.84	and fed and watered,
93.52	and then we want to be sure
93.52	they go to the right schools,
96.24	that they're in the right classes
96.24	at the right schools,
98.84	and that they get the right grades
98.84	in the right classes in the right schools.
102.484	But not just the grades, the scores,
104.24	and not just the grades and scores,
104.24	but the accolades and the awards
107.48	and the sports,
107.48	the activities, the leadership.
109.695	We tell our kids, don't just join a club,
111.64	start a club, because colleges
111.64	want to see that.
113.92	And check the box for community service.
115.88	I mean, show the colleges
115.88	you care about others.
118.16	(Laughter)
120.28	And all of this is done to some
120.28	hoped-for degree of perfection.
125.24	We expect our kids
125.24	to perform at a level of perfection
127.88	we were never asked
127.88	to perform at ourselves,
131.24	and so because so much is required,
133.44	we think,
134.68	well then, of course we parents
134.68	have to argue with every teacher
137.92	and principal and coach and referee
140.52	and act like our kid's concierge
143.44	and personal handler
145.88	and secretary.
147.72	And then with our kids, our precious kids,
149.92	we spend so much time nudging,
152.08	cajoling, hinting, helping, haggling,
152.08	nagging as the case may be,
156.52	to be sure they're not screwing up,
159.4	not closing doors,
161.92	not ruining their future,
164.44	some hoped-for admission
166.72	to a tiny handful of colleges
169.36	that deny almost every applicant.
174.68	And here's what it feels like
174.68	to be a kid in this checklisted childhood.
180.12	First of all, there's
180.12	no time for free play.
182.64	There's no room in the afternoons,
184.32	because everything
184.32	has to be enriching, we think.
187.36	It's as if every piece of homework,
187.36	every quiz, every activity
190.76	is a make-or-break moment
190.76	for this future we have in mind for them,
195.32	and we absolve them
195.32	of helping out around the house,
198.28	and we even absolve them
198.28	of getting enough sleep
201.68	as long as they're checking off
201.68	the items on their checklist.
206.6	And in the checklisted childhood,
206.6	we say we just want them to be happy,
210.44	but when they come home from school,
212.52	what we ask about all too often first
215.68	is their homework and their grades.
218.76	And they see in our faces
220.8	that our approval, that our love,
223.36	that their very worth,
225	comes from A's.
226.88	And then we walk alongside them
229.48	and offer clucking praise like a trainer
229.48	at the Westminster Dog Show --
234.2	(Laughter)
235.44	coaxing them to just jump a little higher
235.44	and soar a little farther,
240.76	day after day after day.
243.84	And when they get to high school,
245.6	"they don't say, ""Well, what might I"
245.6	be interested in studying
248.52	"or doing as an activity?"""
249.8	They go to counselors and they say,
251.52	"""What do I need to do"
251.52	"to get into the right college?"""
255.12	And then, when the grades
255.12	start to roll in in high school,
258.08	and they're getting some B's,
259.68	or God forbid some C's,
262.08	they frantically text their friends
264.04	"and say, ""Has anyone ever gotten"
264.04	"into the right college with these grades?"""
269.959	And our kids,
271.519	regardless of where they end up
271.519	at the end of high school,
275.16	they're breathless.
277.4	They're brittle.
278.64	They're a little burned out.
280.48	They're a little old before their time,
282.4	wishing the grown-ups in their lives
282.4	"had said, ""What you've done is enough,"
286.44	this effort you've put forth
286.44	"in childhood is enough."""
289.44	And they're withering now
289.44	under high rates of anxiety and depression
293.72	and some of them are wondering,
295.96	will this life ever turn out
295.96	to have been worth it?
301.8	Well, we parents,
303.56	we parents are pretty sure
303.56	it's all worth it.
306.96	We seem to behave --
308.2	it's like we literally think
308.2	they will have no future
310.96	if they don't get into one of these
310.96	tiny set of colleges or careers
315.68	we have in mind for them.
317.92	Or maybe, maybe, we're just afraid
321.04	they won't have a future we can brag about
323.4	to our friends and with stickers
323.4	on the backs of our cars.
329.6	Yeah.
330.84	(Applause)
336.92	But if you look at what we've done,
339.48	if you have the courage
339.48	to really look at it,
343.04	you'll see that not only do our kids
343.04	think their worth comes
346.04	from grades and scores,
347.76	but that when we live right up inside
347.76	their precious developing minds
351.68	all the time, like our very own version
351.68	"of the movie ""Being John Malkovich,"""
356.28	we send our children the message:
358.24	"""Hey kid, I don't think you can actually"
358.24	"achieve any of this without me."""
363.48	And so with our overhelp,
366.16	our overprotection
366.16	and overdirection and hand-holding,
368.72	we deprive our kids
368.72	of the chance to build self-efficacy,
372.76	which is a really fundamental tenet
372.76	of the human psyche,
376.48	far more important
376.48	than that self-esteem they get
379.12	every time we applaud.
381.12	Self-efficacy is built when one sees
381.12	that one's own actions lead to outcomes,
387.32	not --
388.56	There you go.
389.8	(Applause)
393.6	Not one's parents'
393.6	actions on one's behalf,
397.4	but when one's own actions
397.4	lead to outcomes.
400.2	So simply put,
401.72	if our children are to develop
401.72	self-efficacy, and they must,
407.08	then they have to do a whole lot more
407.08	of the thinking, planning, deciding,
411.96	doing, hoping, coping, trial and error,
415.56	dreaming and experiencing of life
418.72	for themselves.
421.28	Now, am I saying
423.8	every kid is hard-working and motivated
426.16	and doesn't need a parent's involvement
426.16	or interest in their lives,
429.36	and we should just back off and let go?
432.04	Hell no.
433.28	(Laughter)
434.52	That is not what I'm saying.
436.24	What I'm saying is, when we treat
436.24	grades and scores and accolades and awards
439.88	as the purpose of childhood,
442	all in furtherance of some hoped-for
442	admission to a tiny number of colleges
445.8	or entrance to a small number of careers,
448.8	that that's too narrow a definition
448.8	of success for our kids.
453.2	And even though we might help them
453.2	achieve some short-term wins
456.76	by overhelping --
458	like they get a better grade
458	if we help them do their homework,
462.32	they might end up with a longer
462.32	childhood résumé when we help --
467.12	what I'm saying is that all of this
467.12	comes at a long-term cost
470.52	to their sense of self.
472.6	What I'm saying is,
472.6	we should be less concerned
475.04	with the specific set of colleges
476.88	they might be able
476.88	to apply to or might get into
480.12	and far more concerned that they have
480.12	the habits, the mindset, the skill set,
485.04	the wellness, to be successful
485.04	wherever they go.
490	What I'm saying is,
491.24	our kids need us to be a little
491.24	less obsessed with grades and scores
495.84	and a whole lot more interested
498.16	in childhood providing
498.16	a foundation for their success
503.28	built on things like love
507.24	and chores.
508.48	(Laughter)
510.68	(Applause)
515.24	Did I just say chores?
515.24	Did I just say chores? I really did.
519.92	But really, here's why.
523.28	The longest longitudinal study
523.28	of humans ever conducted
526.96	is called the Harvard Grant Study.
529.159	It found that professional
529.159	success in life,
531.52	which is what we want for our kids,
534.12	that professional success in life
534.12	comes from having done chores as a kid,
537.92	and the earlier you started, the better,
539.96	that a roll-up-your-sleeves-
539.96	and-pitch-in mindset,
542.36	a mindset that says,
542.36	there's some unpleasant work,
544.76	someone's got to do it,
544.76	it might as well be me,
547	a mindset that says,
548.24	I will contribute my effort
548.24	to the betterment of the whole,
551.36	that that's what gets you ahead
551.36	in the workplace.
554.44	Now, we all know this. You know this.
557.36	(Applause)
560.2	We all know this, and yet,
560.2	in the checklisted childhood,
563.8	we absolve our kids of doing
563.8	the work of chores around the house,
567.6	and then they end up
567.6	as young adults in the workplace
570.12	still waiting for a checklist,
572.36	but it doesn't exist,
573.84	and more importantly,
573.84	lacking the impulse, the instinct
577.16	to roll up their sleeves and pitch in
579.4	and look around and wonder,
579.4	how can I be useful to my colleagues?
583	How can I anticipate a few steps ahead
583	to what my boss might need?
588.28	A second very important finding
588.28	from the Harvard Grant Study
592.92	said that happiness in life
595.72	comes from love,
597.6	not love of work,
599.48	love of humans:
602.4	our spouse, our partner,
602.4	our friends, our family.
606.6	So childhood needs to teach
606.6	our kids how to love,
610.32	and they can't love others
610.32	if they don't first love themselves,
613.32	and they won't love themselves
613.32	if we can't offer them unconditional love.
617.32	(Applause)
621.6	Right.
624.24	And so,
626.04	instead of being obsessed
626.04	with grades and scores
628.32	when our precious offspring
628.32	come home from school,
631.24	or we come home from work,
632.76	we need to close our technology,
632.76	put away our phones,
635.56	and look them in the eye
636.96	and let them see
636.96	the joy that fills our faces
640.16	when we see our child
640.16	for the first time in a few hours.
643.32	And then we have to say,
645.28	"""How was your day?"
647.84	"What did you like about today?"""
650.68	And when your teenage daughter
650.68	"says, ""Lunch,"" like mine did,"
654.44	and I want to hear about the math test,
656.52	not lunch,
657.96	you have to still
657.96	take an interest in lunch.
661	"You gotta say, ""What was great"
661	"about lunch today?"""
664.2	They need to know
664.2	they matter to us as humans,
667.6	not because of their GPA.
671.64	All right, so you're thinking,
671.64	chores and love,
673.88	that sounds all well and good,
673.88	but give me a break.
676.4	The colleges want to see
676.4	top scores and grades
679.4	and accolades and awards,
679.4	and I'm going to tell you, sort of.
685.08	The very biggest brand-name schools
685.08	are asking that of our young adults,
691	but here's the good news.
693.16	Contrary to what the college
693.16	rankings racket would have us believe --
698.28	(Applause)
704.04	you don't have to go to one
704.04	of the biggest brand name schools
706.96	to be happy and successful in life.
708.72	Happy and successful people
708.72	went to state school,
711.6	went to a small college
711.6	no one has heard of,
713.88	went to community college,
715.48	went to a college over here
715.48	and flunked out.
718.24	(Applause)
725.24	The evidence is in this room,
725.24	is in our communities,
728.24	that this is the truth.
729.96	And if we could widen our blinders
731.68	and be willing to look
731.68	at a few more colleges,
733.96	maybe remove our own egos
733.96	from the equation,
737.52	we could accept and embrace
737.52	this truth and then realize,
741.2	it is hardly the end of the world
743.2	if our kids don't go to one
743.2	of those big brand-name schools.
747.96	And more importantly,
749.24	if their childhood has not been lived
749.24	according to a tyrannical checklist
754.36	then when they get to college,
756.52	whichever one it is,
758.48	well, they'll have gone there
758.48	on their own volition,
761.6	fueled by their own desire,
764.08	capable and ready to thrive there.
769.36	I have to admit something to you.
771.76	I've got two kids I mentioned,
771.76	Sawyer and Avery.
774.88	They're teenagers.
776.6	And once upon a time,
778.48	I think I was treating my Sawyer and Avery
781.12	like little bonsai trees --
782.92	(Laughter)
785.28	that I was going
785.28	to carefully clip and prune
788.24	and shape into some perfect
788.24	form of a human
792.16	that might just be perfect enough
792.16	to warrant them admission
795.68	to one of the most
795.68	highly selective colleges.
799.04	But I've come to realize, after working
799.04	with thousands of other people's kids --
803.64	(Laughter)
806.48	and raising two kids of my own,
810.2	my kids aren't bonsai trees.
813.8	They're wildflowers
816.4	of an unknown genus and species --
819.24	(Laughter)
821.16	and it's my job to provide
821.16	a nourishing environment,
824.6	to strengthen them through chores
827	and to love them so they can
827	love others and receive love
831.32	and the college, the major, the career,
834.44	that's up to them.
836.16	My job is not to make them become
836.16	what I would have them become,
841.84	but to support them
841.84	in becoming their glorious selves.
847.4	Thank you.
848.64	(Applause)
