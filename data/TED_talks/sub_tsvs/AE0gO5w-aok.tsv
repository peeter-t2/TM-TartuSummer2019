13.039	I cannot forget them.
15.692	Their names were Aslan, Alik, Andrei,
20.469	Fernanda, Fred, Galina, Gunnhild,
25.113	Hans, Ingeborg, Matti, Natalya,
30.407	Nancy, Sheryl, Usman, Zarema,
35.167	and the list is longer.
38.255	For many, their existence,
38.255	their humanity,
41.599	has been reduced to statistics,
45.244	"coldly recorded as ""security incidents."""
49.54	For me, they were colleagues
51.095	belonging to that community
51.095	of humanitarian aid workers
54.625	that tried to bring a bit of comfort
57.434	to the victims of the wars
57.434	in Chechnya in the '90s.
61.521	They were nurses, logisticians,
61.521	shelter experts,
66.164	paralegals, interpreters.
68.997	And for this service, they were murdered,
73.153	their families torn apart,
75.615	and their story largely forgotten.
78.827	No one was ever sentenced
78.827	for these crimes.
82.884	I cannot forget them.
85.041	They live in me somehow,
87.09	their memories giving me
87.09	meaning every day.
90.32	But they are also haunting
90.32	the dark street of my mind.
94.751	As humanitarian aid workers,
96.712	they made the choice
96.712	to be at the side of the victim,
100.064	to provide some assistance,
100.064	some comfort, some protection,
104.661	but when they needed
104.661	protection themselves,
107.587	it wasn't there.
109.685	When you see the headlines
109.685	of your newspaper these days
112.858	with the war in Iraq or in Syria --
115.923	aid worker abducted, hostage executed --
120.087	but who were they?
122.1	Why were they there?
124.025	What motivated them?
126.033	How did we become
126.033	so indifferent to these crimes?
129.909	This is why I am here today with you.
133.038	We need to find better ways
133.038	to remember them.
136.575	We also need to explain the key values
136.575	to which they dedicated their lives.
142.566	We also need to demand justice.
148.058	When in '96 I was sent
149.939	by the United Nations High Commissioner
149.939	for Refugees to the North Caucasus,
153.654	I knew some of the risks.
155.526	Five colleagues had been killed,
157.879	three had been seriously injured,
159.946	seven had already been taken hostage.
162.291	So we were careful.
164.078	We were using armored 
164.078	vehicles, decoy cars,
168.152	changing patterns of travel,
168.152	changing homes,
171.207	all sorts of security measures.
175.258	Yet on a cold winter night
175.258	of January '98, it was my turn.
181.208	When I entered my flat
181.208	in Vladikavkaz with a guard,
185.185	we were surrounded by armed men.
188.781	They took the guard,
188.781	they put him on the floor,
190.998	they beat him up in front of me,
193.622	tied him, dragged him away.
197.536	I was handcuffed, blindfolded,
197.536	and forced to kneel,
202.321	as the silencer of a gun
202.321	pressed against my neck.
206.204	When it happens to you,
207.942	there is no time for thinking,
207.942	no time for praying.
212.045	My brain went on automatic,
214.749	rewinding quickly
214.749	the life I'd just left behind.
219.115	It took me long minutes to figure out
221.645	that those masked men there
221.645	were not there to kill me,
225.058	but that someone, somewhere,
225.058	had ordered my kidnapping.
230.551	Then a process of dehumanization
230.551	started that day.
234.622	I was no more than just a commodity.
241.195	I normally don't talk about this,
243.011	but I'd like to share a bit with you
243.011	some of those 317 days of captivity.
248.598	I was kept in an underground cellar,
251.654	total darkness,
253.718	for 23 hours and 45 minutes every day,
257.472	and then the guards 
257.472	would come, normally two.
260.758	They would bring a big piece of bread,
263.432	a bowl of soup, and a candle.
267.206	That candle would burn for 15 minutes,
275.088	and then they would take it away,
275.088	and I returned to darkness.
281.024	I was chained by a metal cable to my bed.
284.538	I could do only four small steps.
288.95	I always dreamt of the fifth one.
292.735	And no TV, no radio,
292.735	no newspaper, no one to talk to.
296.976	I had no towel, no soap, no toilet paper,
301.069	just two metal buckets open,
301.069	one for water, for one waste.
309.926	Can you imagine that mock execution
309.926	can be a pastime for guards
314.955	when they are sadistic
314.955	or when they are just bored or drunk?
321.665	We are breaking my nerves very slowly.
325.073	Isolation and darkness
325.073	are particularly difficult to describe.
329.583	How do you describe nothing?
331.975	There are no words for the depths
331.975	of loneliness I reached
334.993	in that very thin border
334.993	between sanity and madness.
342.168	In the darkness, sometimes
342.168	I played imaginary games of checkers.
347.408	I would start with the black,
349.611	play with the white,
351.27	back to the black
351.27	trying to trick the other side.
355.469	I don't play checkers anymore.
358.86	I was tormented by the thoughts of my
358.86	family and my colleague, the guard, Edik.
365.177	I didn't know what had happened to him.
367.987	I was trying not to think,
370.472	I tried to fill up my time
371.932	by doing all sorts of physical
371.932	exercise on the spot.
375.743	I tried to pray, I tried all sorts
375.743	of memorization games.
381.063	But darkness also creates images
381.063	and thoughts that are not normal.
385.456	One part of your brain wants you
385.456	to resist, to shout, to cry,
391.717	and the other part of the brain
391.717	orders you to shut up
395.154	and just go through it.
397.963	It's a constant internal debate;
397.963	there is no one to arbitrate.
403.163	Once a guard came to me,
403.163	very aggressively, and he told me,
408.083	"""Today you're going to kneel"
408.083	"and beg for your food."""
412.22	I wasn't in a good mood,
412.22	so I insulted him.
415.842	I insulted his mother,
415.842	I insulted his ancestors.
418.776	The consequence was moderate:
418.776	he threw the food into my waste.
423.207	The day after he came back
423.207	with the same demand.
426.882	He got the same answer,
429.321	which had the same consequence.
433.532	Four days later,
433.532	the body was full of pain.
437.363	I didn't know hunger hurt so much
437.363	when you have so little.
441.705	So when the guards came down,
448.049	I knelt.
451.063	I begged for my food.
454.081	Submission was the only way for me
454.081	to make it to another candle.
461.302	After my kidnapping,
463.113	I was transferred
463.113	from North Ossetia to Chechnya,
466.27	three days of slow travel
466.27	in the trunks of different cars,
470.59	and upon arrival, I was interrogated
472.889	for 11 days by a guy called Ruslan.
476.554	The routine was always the same:
478.318	a bit more light, 45 minutes.
480.71	He would come down to the cellar,
482.985	he would ask the guards
482.985	to tie me on the chair,
485.249	and he would turn on the music loud.
488.349	And then he would yell questions.
491.53	He would scream. He would beat me.
494.325	I'll spare you the details.
496.248	There are many questions
496.248	I could not understand,
498.681	and there are some questions
498.681	I did not want to understand.
504.254	The length of the interrogation
504.254	was the duration of the tape:
511.8	I would always long for the last song.
514.575	On one day, one night in that cellar,
514.575	I don't know what it was,
518.28	I heard a child crying above my head,
521.297	a boy, maybe two or three years old.
524.129	Footsteps, confusion, people running.
528.866	So when Ruslan came the day after,
531.9	before he put the first question to me,
534.369	"I asked him, ""How is your son today?"
534.369	"Is he feeling better?"""
537.968	Ruslan was taken by surprise.
540.754	He was furious that the guards
540.754	may have leaked some details
543.583	about his private life.
546.161	I kept talking about NGOs
546.161	supplying medicines to local clinics
550.874	that may help his son to get better.
553.785	And we talked about education,
553.785	we talked about families.
557.909	He talked to me about his children.
559.767	I talked to him about my daughters.
561.833	And then he'd talk about guns,
561.833	about cars, about women,
565.223	and I had to talk about guns,
565.223	about cars, about women.
569.542	And we talked until
569.542	the last song on the tape.
573.28	Ruslan was the most brutal man I ever met.
578.923	He did not touch me anymore.
582.22	He did not ask any other questions.
584.936	I was no longer just a commodity.
588.791	Two days after, I was transferred
588.791	to another place.
593.76	There, a guard came to me,
593.76	very close -- it was quite unusual --
598.866	and he said with
598.866	a very soft voice, he said,
602.025	"""I'd like to thank you"
604.649	for the assistance your organization
604.649	provided my family
608.689	when we were displaced
608.689	"in nearby Dagestan."""
614.308	What could I possibly reply?
617.891	It was so painful.
617.891	It was like a blade in the belly.
622.667	It took me weeks of internal thinking
622.667	to try to reconcile
626.011	the good reasons we had
626.011	to assist that family
629.285	and the soldier of fortune he became.
632.257	He was young, he was shy.
634.37	I never saw his face.
636.645	He probably meant well.
639.315	But in those 15 seconds,
641.707	he made me question everything we did,
645.422	all the sacrifices.
647.813	He made me think also how they see us.
651.366	Until then, I had assumed
651.366	that they know why we are there
654.036	and what we are doing.
656.915	One cannot assume this.
659.768	Well, explaining why we do this
659.768	is not that easy,
664.02	even to our closest relatives.
667.062	We are not perfect, we are not superior,
670.459	we are not the world's fire brigade,
672.935	we are not superheroes,
675.049	we don't stop wars,
676.721	we know that humanitarian response is not
676.721	a substitute for political solution.
682.105	Yet we do this because one life matters.
686.563	Sometimes that's the only
686.563	difference you make --
688.816	one individual, one family,
688.816	a small group of individuals --
692.136	and it matters.
694.11	When you have a tsunami,
694.11	an earthquake or a typhoon,
696.967	you see teams of rescuers
696.967	coming from all over the world,
701.075	searching for survivors for weeks.
704.117	Why? Nobody questions this.
706.671	Every life matters,
708.784	or every life should matter.
713.01	This is the same for us
713.01	when we help refugees,
715.935	people displaced within their country
715.935	by conflict, or stateless persons,
721.595	I know many people,
723.39	when they are confronted
723.39	by overwhelming suffering,
726.398	they feel powerless and they stop there.
730.169	It's a pity, because there are
730.169	so many ways people can help.
734.046	We don't stop with that feeling.
736.027	We try to do whatever we can
736.027	to provide some assistance,
738.678	some protection, some comfort.
741.332	We have to.
743.093	We can't do otherwise.
744.843	It's what makes us feel,
744.843	I don't know, simply human.
750.197	That's a picture of me
750.197	the day of my release.
754.316	Months after my release,
754.316	I met the then-French prime minister.
758.658	The second thing he told me:
760.7	"""You were totally irresponsible"
760.7	to go to the North Caucasus.
764.231	You don't know how many
764.231	"problems you've created for us."""
770.017	It was a short meeting.
771.852	(Laughter)
774.661	I think helping people
774.661	in danger is responsible.
779.235	In that war, that nobody
779.235	seriously wanted to stop,
783.763	and we have many of these today,
786.108	bringing some assistance to people in need
786.108	and a bit of protection
790.608	was not just an act of humanity,
792.517	it was making a real difference
792.517	for the people.
795.419	Why could he not understand this?
798.67	We have a responsibility to try.
800.597	You've heard about that concept:
800.597	Responsibility to Protect.
804.431	Outcomes may depend
804.431	on various parameters.
808.512	We may even fail,
808.512	but there is worse than failing --
812.369	it's not even trying when we can.
816.441	Well, if you are met this way,
816.441	if you sign up for this sort of job,
820.316	your life is going to be full
820.316	of joy and sadness,
824.954	because there are a lot of people
824.954	we cannot help,
827.633	a lot of people we cannot protect,
827.633	a lot of people we did not save.
831.557	I call them my ghost,
833.8	and by having witnessed
833.8	their suffering from close,
836.757	you take a bit 
836.757	of that suffering on yourself.
841.304	Many young humanitarian workers
843.97	go through their first experience
843.97	with a lot of bitterness.
846.988	They are thrown into situations
846.988	where they are witness,
849.96	but they are powerless
849.96	to bring any change.
853.072	They have to learn to accept it
855.579	and gradually turn this
855.579	into positive energy.
858.958	It's difficult.
860.407	Many don't succeed,
862.945	but for those who do,
862.945	there is no other job like this.
866.953	You can see the difference
866.953	you make every day.
871.643	Humanitarian aid workers
871.643	know the risk they are taking
874.805	in conflict areas or 
874.805	in post-conflict environments,
879.717	yet our life, our job, is becoming 
879.717	increasingly life-threatening,
886.429	and the sanctity of our life is fading.
891.441	Do you know that since the millennium,
894.1	the number of attacks on humanitarian 
894.1	aid workers has tripled?
913.375	So many broken lives.
917.178	Until the beginning of the civil war
917.178	in Somalia in the late '80s,
922.38	humanitarian aid workers
922.38	were sometimes victims
926.49	of what we call collateral damages,
928.487	but by and large we were not
928.487	the target of these attacks.
932.202	This has changed.
933.756	Look at this picture.
935.032	Baghdad, August 2003:
940.631	Gone are the days when
940.631	a U.N. blue flag or a Red Cross
944.157	would automatically protect us.
947.933	Criminal groups and some political groups
951.195	have cross-fertilized
951.195	over the last 20 years,
954.051	and they've created these sort of hybrids
957.186	with whom we have no way of communicating.
960.052	Humanitarian principles are tested,
960.052	questioned, and often ignored,
965.426	but perhaps more importantly,
965.426	we have abandoned the search for justice.
970.312	There seems to be
970.312	no consequence whatsoever
973.532	for attacks against
973.532	humanitarian aid workers.
976.997	After my release, I was told
976.997	not to seek any form of justice.
981.357	It won't do you any good,
981.357	that's what I was told.
984.584	Plus, you're going to put in danger
984.584	the life of other colleagues.
989.723	It took me years to see the sentencing
992.884	of three people associated 
992.884	with my kidnapping,
997.175	but this was the exception.
999.711	There was no justice for any 
999.711	of the humanitarian aid workers
1004.23	killed or abducted in Chechnya
1004.23	between '95 and '99,
1008.518	and it's the same all over the world.
1012.436	This is unacceptable.
1014.583	This is inexcusable.
1016.394	Attacks on humanitarian aid workers
1016.394	are war crimes in international law.
1021.107	Those crimes should not go unpunished.
1024.195	We must end this cycle of impunity.
1026.935	We must consider that those attacks
1026.935	against humanitarian aid workers
1030.766	are attacks against humanity itself.
1034.319	That makes me furious.
1038.274	I know I'm very lucky
1038.274	compared to the refugees I work for.
1044.414	I don't know what it is to have seen
1044.414	my whole town destroyed.
1048.041	I don't know what it is to have seen
1048.041	my relatives shot in front of me.
1052.105	I don't know what it is to lose
1052.105	the protection of my country.
1056.354	I also know that I'm very lucky
1056.354	compared to other hostages.
1060.649	Four days before my eventful release,
1060.649	four hostages were beheaded
1066.331	a few miles away from where
1066.331	I was kept in captivity.
1070.726	Why them?
1072.93	Why am I here today?
1076.641	No easy answer.
1080.43	I was received with a lot of support
1080.43	that I got from my relatives,
1084.043	from colleagues, from friends,
1084.043	from people I didn't know.
1087.862	They have helped me over the years
1087.862	to come out of the darkness.
1092.291	Not everyone was treated
1092.291	with the same attention.
1096.189	How many of my colleagues,
1096.189	after a traumatic incident,
1099.814	took their own life?
1103.09	I can count nine that I knew personally.
1106.819	How many of my colleagues
1106.819	went through a difficult divorce
1110.547	after a traumatic experience
1113.481	because they could not explain
1113.481	anything anymore to their spouse?
1118.209	I've lost that count.
1120.663	There is a price for this type of life.
1124.223	In Russia, all war monuments have
1124.223	this beautiful inscription at the top.
1128.856	It says, (In Russian)
1132.965	"""No one is forgotten,"
1132.965	"nothing is forgotten."""
1137.386	I do not forget my lost colleagues.
1140.523	I cannot forget anything.
1142.859	I call on you to remember their dedication
1146.072	and demand that humanitarian
1146.072	aid workers around the world
1149.578	be better protected.
1152.155	We should not let that light of hope
1152.155	they have brought to be switched off.
1157.751	After my ordeal, a lot of colleagues
1157.751	"asked me, ""But why do you continue?"
1162.441	Why do you do this sort of job?
1164.647	"Why do you have to go back to it?"""
1167.201	My answer was very simple:
1170.066	If I had quit,
1172.536	that would have meant
1172.536	my kidnapper had won.
1176.553	They would have taken my soul
1178.904	and my humanity.
1181.179	Thank you.
1183.826	(Applause)
