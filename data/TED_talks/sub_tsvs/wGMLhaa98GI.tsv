12.859	Diana Reiss: You may think you're looking
14.836	through a window at a dolphin
14.836	spinning playfully,
18.942	but what you're actually looking through
21.1	is a two-way mirror at a dolphin
23.661	looking at itself spinning playfully.
26.851	This is a dolphin that is self-aware.
28.974	This dolphin has self-awareness.
30.596	It's a young dolphin named Bayley.
32.676	I've been very interested
32.676	in understanding the nature
35.724	of the intelligence of dolphins
35.724	for the past 30 years.
39.147	How do we explore
39.147	intelligence in this animal
42.331	that's so different from us?
43.821	And what I've used is a very
43.821	simple research tool,
46.881	a mirror, and we've gained
46.881	great information,
49.461	reflections of these animal minds.
52.918	Dolphins aren't the only animals,
52.918	the only non-human animals,
56.518	to show mirror self-recognition.
58.658	We used to think this
58.658	was a uniquely human ability,
61.65	but we learned that the great
61.65	apes, our closest relatives,
64.951	also show this ability.
66.536	Then we showed it in dolphins,
68.235	and then later in elephants.
70.247	We did this work in my lab
70.247	with the dolphins and elephants,
73.081	and it's been recently
73.081	shown in the magpie.
75.25	Now, it's interesting,
75.25	because we've embraced
78.15	this Darwinian view of a continuity
78.15	in physical evolution,
82.172	this physical continuity.
83.764	But we've been much more
83.764	reticent, much slower
87.047	at recognizing this
87.047	continuity in cognition,
90.983	in emotion, in consciousness
90.983	in other animals.
93.967	Other animals are conscious.
96.533	They're emotional. They're aware.
99.823	There have been multitudes
99.823	of studies with many species
102.708	over the years that have
102.708	given us exquisite evidence
106.279	for thinking and consciousness
106.279	in other animals,
109.15	other animals that are quite
109.15	different than we are in form.
112.741	We are not alone.
115.434	We are not alone in these abilities.
119.564	And I hope, and one of my biggest dreams,
122.929	is that, with our growing awareness
125.7	about the consciousness of others
127.296	and our relationship with the rest
127.296	of the animal world,
129.94	that we'll give them
129.94	the respect and protection
132.53	that they deserve.
133.411	So that's a wish I'm throwing
133.411	out here for everybody,
135.959	and I hope I can really
135.959	engage you in this idea.
139.8	Now, I want to return to dolphins,
141.443	because these are the animals
141.443	that I feel like
143.659	I've been working up closely
143.659	and personal with
146.204	for over 30 years.
147.614	And these are real personalities.
149.463	They are not persons,
149.463	but they're personalities
152.564	in every sense of the word.
154.05	And you can't get more
154.05	alien than the dolphin.
157.236	They are very different
157.236	from us in body form.
159.732	They're radically different. They come
159.732	from a radically different environment.
163.471	In fact, we're separated
163.471	by 95 million years
167.081	of divergent evolution.
169.227	Look at this body.
171.127	And in every sense of making a pun here,
174.817	these are true non-terrestrials.
179.18	I wondered how we might
179.18	interface with these animals.
182.628	In the 1980s, I developed
182.628	an underwater keyboard.
185.95	This was a custom-made
185.95	touch-screen keyboard.
188.369	What I wanted to do was give
188.369	the dolphins choice and control.
191.298	These are big brains,
191.298	highly social animals,
193.42	and I thought, well, if we give
193.42	them choice and control,
196.586	if they can hit a symbol
196.586	on this keyboard --
198.658	and by the way, it was interfaced
198.658	by fiber optic cables
201.329	from Hewlett-Packard
201.329	with an Apple II computer.
204.199	This seems prehistoric now,
206.086	but this was where
206.086	we were with technology.
208.283	So the dolphins could hit a key, a symbol,
211.106	they heard a computer-generated whistle,
213.28	and they got an object or activity.
215.085	Now here's a little video.
216.503	This is Delphi and Pan,
216.503	and you're going to see Delphi
219.321	hitting a key, he hears a computer-generated
219.321	whistle -- (Whistle) --
223.47	and gets a ball, so they can
223.47	actually ask for things they want.
227.183	What was remarkable is,
227.183	they explored this keyboard
231.322	on their own. There was no
231.322	intervention on our part.
234.669	They explored the keyboard.
234.669	They played around with it.
237.313	They figured out how it worked.
238.872	And they started to quickly
238.872	imitate the sounds
241.087	they were hearing on the keyboard.
243.836	They imitated on their own.
245.793	Beyond that, though, they started learning
247.964	associations
247.964	between the symbols, the sounds
250.724	and the objects.
253.049	What we saw was self-organized learning,
256.576	and now I'm imagining, what can we do
259.975	with new technologies?
261.377	How can we create interfaces,
261.377	new windows into
264.312	the minds of animals,
264.312	with the technologies that exist today?
269.233	So I was thinking about this,
269.233	and then, one day,
272.32	I got a call from Peter.
278.753	Peter Gabriel: I make noises for a living.
280.777	On a good day, it's music,
282.515	and I want to talk a little bit about
284.301	the most amazing music-making
284.301	experience I ever had.
288.44	I'm a farm boy. I grew
288.44	up surrounded by animals,
291.656	and I would look in these eyes and wonder
293.655	what was going on there?
295.35	So as an adult, when
295.35	I started to read about
297.618	the amazing breakthroughs
297.618	with Penny Patterson and Koko,
300.887	with Sue Savage-Rumbaugh
300.887	and Kanzi, Panbanisha,
304.121	Irene Pepperberg, Alex the parrot,
306.542	I got all excited.
309.01	What was amazing to me also
310.981	was they seemed a lot more adept
314.81	at getting a handle on our language
317.774	than we were on getting
317.774	a handle on theirs.
321.938	I work with a lot of musicians
321.938	from around the world,
325.557	and often we don't have
325.557	any common language at all,
328.325	but we sit down behind our instruments,
332.012	and suddenly there's a way
332.012	for us to connect and emote.
335.349	So I started cold-calling,
335.349	and eventually got through
338.165	to Sue Savage-Rumbaugh,
340.298	and she invited me down.
342.197	I went down, and the bonobos
346.579	had had access to percussion instruments,
349.35	musical toys, but never
349.35	before to a keyboard.
352.984	At first they did what infants do,
354.628	just bashed it with their fists,
356.659	and then I asked, through Sue,
359.132	if Panbanisha could try
359.132	with one finger only.
363.105	Sue Savage-Rumbaugh: Can
363.105	you play a grooming song?
368.282	I want to hear a grooming song.
370.208	Play a real quiet grooming song.
376.808	PG: So groom was the subject of the piece.
380.4	(Music)
397.895	So I'm just behind, jamming,
401.665	yeah, this is what we started with.
406.41	Sue's encouraging her
406.41	to continue a little more.
409.927	(Music)
458.746	She discovers a note she likes,
463.652	finds the octave.
467.367	She'd never sat at a keyboard before.
478.178	Nice triplets.
492.709	SSR: You did good. That was very good.
496.043	PG: She hit good.
497.458	(Applause)
502.949	So that night, we began to dream,
507.194	and we thought, perhaps
507.194	the most amazing tool
509.969	that man's created is the Internet,
512.149	and what would happen if we could somehow
515.957	find new interfaces,
517.853	visual-audio interfaces that would allow
521.456	these remarkable sentient beings
523.816	that we share the planet with access?
526.402	And Sue Savage-Rumbaugh
526.402	got excited about that,
530.414	called her friend Steve Woodruff,
532.535	and we began hustling all sorts of people
535.623	whose work related or was inspiring,
538.686	which led us to Diana,
540.855	and led us to Neil.
543.842	Neil Gershenfeld: Thanks, Peter.
543.842	PG: Thank you.
546.057	(Applause)
549.666	NG: So Peter approached me.
551.338	I lost it when I saw that clip.
553.958	He approached me with a vision
553.958	of doing these things
557.018	not for people, for animals.
558.632	And then I was struck
558.632	in the history of the Internet.
561.41	This is what the Internet
561.41	looked like when it was born
565.313	and you can call that the Internet
567.846	of middle-aged white men,
569.474	mostly middle-aged white men.
570.494	Vint Cerf: (Laughs)
572.571	(Laughter)
575.609	NG: Speaking as one.
577.231	Then, when I first came to TED,
580.339	which was where I met
580.339	Peter, I showed this.
582.465	This is a $1 web server,
584.851	and at the time that was radical.
587.3	And the possibility of making
587.3	a web server for a dollar
591.006	grew into what became known
591.006	as the Internet of Things,
594.551	which is literally an industry
594.551	now with tremendous implications
597.803	for health care, energy efficiency.
600.28	And we were happy with ourselves.
601.697	And then when Peter showed me that,
603.388	I realized we had missed something,
605.079	which is the rest of the planet.
607.106	So we started up this
607.106	interspecies Internet project.
609.607	Now we started talking with TED
611.233	about how you bring dolphins
611.233	and great apes and elephants
613.972	to TED, and we realized
613.972	that wouldn't work.
616.547	So we're going to bring you to them.
618.621	So if we could switch
618.621	to the audio from this computer,
621.217	we've been video conferencing
621.217	with cognitive animals,
624.562	and we're going to have each of them
625.774	just briefly introduce them.
627.509	And so if we could also
627.509	have this up, great.
629.629	So the first site we're going to meet
631.456	is Cameron Park Zoo
631.456	in Waco, with orangutans.
634.524	In the daytime they live outside.
634.524	It's nighttime there now.
637.358	So can you please go ahead?
640.423	Terri Cox: Hi, I'm Terri Cox
643.082	with the Cameron Park Zoo in Waco, Texas,
645.512	and with me I have KeraJaan and Mei,
649.203	two of our Bornean orangutans.
651.275	During the day, they have
651.275	a beautiful, large outdoor habitat,
656.403	and at night, they come into this habitat,
659.095	into their night quarters,
660.811	where they can have a climate-controlled
662.74	and secure environment to sleep in.
664.732	We participate in the Apps
664.732	for Apes program
669.127	Orangutan Outreach, and we use iPads
672.56	to help stimulate and enrich the animals,
674.749	and also help raise awareness
676.458	for these critically endangered animals.
678.895	And they share 97 percent of our DNA
683.143	and are incredibly intelligent,
684.951	so it's so exciting to think
684.951	of all the opportunities
688.462	that we have via technology
688.462	and the Internet
691.498	to really enrich their lives
691.498	and open up their world.
695.24	We're really excited about the possibility
697.317	of an interspecies Internet,
699.167	and K.J. has
699.167	been enjoying the conference very much.
703.52	NG: That's great. When we were
703.52	rehearsing last night,
706.068	he had fun watching the elephants.
707.964	Next user group are the dolphins
707.964	at the National Aquarium.
711.032	Please go ahead.
713.526	Allison Ginsburg: Good evening.
714.675	Well, my name is Allison Ginsburg,
716.319	and we're live in Baltimore
716.319	at the National Aquarium.
719.165	Joining me are three of our eight Atlantic
719.165	bottlenose dolphins:
	who was our first dolphin born here,
725.969	her four-year-old daughter Bayley,
728.681	and her half sister, 11-year-old Maya.
732.1	Now, here at the National Aquarium
733.744	we are committed to excellence
733.744	in animal care,
736.721	to research, and to conservation.
739.193	The dolphins are pretty intrigued
739.193	as to what's going on here tonight.
742.505	They're not really used
742.505	to having cameras here
744.72	at 8 o'clock at night.
746.197	In addition, we are very
746.197	committed to doing
748.931	different types of research.
750.389	As Diana mentioned,
750.389	our animals are involved
753.002	in many different research studies.
766.927	NG: Those are for you.
770.316	Okay, that's great, thank you.
772.114	And the third user group, in Thailand,
775.356	is Think Elephants. Go ahead, Josh.
779.709	Josh Plotnik: Hi, my name is Josh Plotnik,
781.984	and I'm with Think
781.984	Elephants International,
784.2	and we're here in the Golden
784.2	Triangle of Thailand
786.558	with the Golden Triangle Asian
786.558	Elephant Foundation elephants.
789.633	And we have 26 elephants here,
792.013	and our research is focused on the evolution
792.013	of intelligence with elephants,
796.206	but our foundation Think
796.206	Elephants is focused
798.569	on bringing elephants
798.569	into classrooms around the world
801.615	virtually like this and showing people
803.819	how incredible these animals are.
805.952	So we're able to bring the camera
805.952	right up to the elephant,
808.111	put food into the elephant's mouth,
810.329	show people what's going
810.329	on inside their mouths,
812.775	and show everyone around the world
814.911	how incredible these animals really are.
817.815	NG: Okay, that's great. Thanks Josh.
820.319	And once again, we've been building
820.319	great relationships
822.311	among them just
822.311	since we've been rehearsing.
824.767	So at that point, if we can go
824.767	back to the other computer,
827.553	we were starting to think
827.553	about how you integrate
829.911	the rest of the biomass
829.911	of the planet into the Internet,
832.76	and we went to the best possible person
835.367	I can think of, which is Vint Cerf,
838.03	who is one of the founders
838.03	who gave us the Internet. Vint?
841.076	VC: Thank you, Neil.
843.444	(Applause)
847.03	A long time ago in a galaxy
847.03	— oops, wrong script.
852.11	Forty years ago, Bob Kahn and I
854.58	did the design of the Internet.
856.179	Thirty years ago, we turned it on.
858.942	Just last year, we turned
858.942	on the production Internet.
862.027	You've been using the experimental version
864.15	for the last 30 years.
865.626	The production version,
865.626	it uses IP version 6.
868.98	It has 3.4 times 10 to the 38th
868.98	possible terminations.
873.98	That's a number only that Congress
873.98	can appreciate.
877.137	But it leads to what is coming next.
881.238	When Bob and I did this design,
883.9	we thought we were building a system
883.9	to connect computers together.
887.406	What we very quickly discovered
889.241	is that this was a system
889.241	for connecting people together.
892.424	And what you've seen tonight
894.892	tells you that we should
894.892	not restrict this network
898.834	to one species,
901.016	that these other intelligent,
901.016	sentient species
904.857	should be part of the system too.
907.33	This is the system as it
907.33	looks today, by the way.
909.688	This is what the Internet
909.688	looks like to a computer
912.883	that's trying to figure
912.883	out where the traffic
915.153	is supposed to go.
916.802	This is generated by a program
919.427	that's looking at the connectivity
919.427	of the Internet,
922.176	and how all the various networks
922.176	are connected together.
925.013	There are about 400,000
925.013	networks, interconnected,
928.378	run independently by 400,000
928.378	different operating agencies,
933.517	and the only reason this works
934.97	is that they all use the same
934.97	standard TCP/IP protocols.
938.795	Well, you know where this is headed.
941.15	The Internet of Things tell us
943.441	that a lot of computer-enabled
943.441	appliances and devices
947.737	are going to become part
947.737	of this system too:
950.193	appliances that you use around the house,
952.466	that you use in your office,
954.385	that you carry around with yourself
954.385	or in the car.
957.01	That's the Internet
957.01	of Things that's coming.
959.377	Now, what's important
959.377	about what these people are doing
962.179	is that they're beginning to learn
964.53	how to communicate with species
967.78	that are not us
969.122	but share a common sensory environment.
972.225	We're beginning to explore what it means
974.449	to communicate with something
976.013	that isn't just another person.
978.375	Well, you can see what's coming next.
981.101	All kinds of possible sentient beings
984.029	may be interconnected through this system,
986.053	and I can't wait to see
986.053	these experiments unfold.
989.17	What happens after that?
991.185	Well, let's see.
993.915	There are machines that need
993.915	to talk to machines
997.1	and that we need to talk to,
997.1	and so as time goes on,
1000.358	we're going to have to learn
1002.177	how to communicate with computers
1003.945	and how to get computers
1003.945	to communicate with us
1006.444	in the way that we're accustomed to,
1008.263	not with keyboards, not with mice,
1011.126	but with speech and gestures
1013.19	and all the natural human language
1013.19	that we're accustomed to.
1016.174	So we'll need something like C3PO
1018.311	to become a translator between ourselves
1021.759	and some of the other
1021.759	machines we live with.
1023.901	Now, there is a project that's underway
1026.277	called the interplanetary Internet.
1028.099	It's in operation between Earth and Mars.
1030.823	It's operating on the International
1030.823	Space Station.
1033.845	It's part of the spacecraft
1033.845	that's in orbit around the Sun
1037.536	that's rendezvoused with two planets.
1039.358	So the interplanetary
1039.358	system is on its way,
1041.623	but there's a last project,
1043.329	which the Defense Advanced
1043.329	Research Projects Agency,
1046.126	which funded the original ARPANET,
1048.086	funded the Internet, funded
1048.086	the interplanetary architecture,
1051.576	is now funding a project
1051.576	to design a spacecraft
1054.911	to get to the nearest
1054.911	star in 100 years' time.
1059.073	What that means
1059.073	is that what we're learning
1061.676	with these interactions with other species
1063.848	will teach us, ultimately,
1065.987	how we might interact
1065.987	with an alien from another world.
1069.98	I can hardly wait.
1072.63	(Applause)
1079.831	June Cohen: So first of all, thank you,
1080.809	and I would like to acknowledge
1080.809	that four people
1083.367	who could talk to us for full four days
1085.28	actually managed to stay
1085.28	to four minutes each,
1087.495	and we thank you for that.
1088.878	I have so many questions,
1090.157	but maybe a few practical things
1090.157	that the audience might want to know.
1093.515	You're launching this idea here at TED —
1093.515	PG: Today.
1096.041	JC: Today. This is the first
1096.041	time you're talking about it.
1097.237	Tell me a little bit about where
1097.237	you're going to take the idea.
1100.261	What's next?
1101.294	PG: I think we want
1101.294	to engage as many people
1104.582	here as possible in helping us
1106.642	think of smart interfaces
1106.642	that will make all this possible.
1110.991	NG: And just mechanically,
1112.357	there's a 501(c)(3) and web infrastructure
1114.862	and all of that, but it's not
1114.862	quite ready to turn on,
1116.885	so we'll roll that out, and contact us
1118.917	if you want the information on it.
1120.561	The idea is this will be -- much
1120.561	like the Internet functions
1123.668	as a network of networks,
1124.673	which is Vint's core contribution,
1126.317	this will be a wrapper
1126.317	around all of these initiatives,
1128.582	that are wonderful individually,
1128.582	to link them globally.
1131.377	JC: Right, and do you have a web address
1132.941	that we might look for yet?
1133.985	NG: Shortly. JC: Shortly. We
1133.985	will come back to you on that.
1136.771	And very quickly, just to clarify.
1140.048	Some people might have looked
1140.048	at the video that you showed
1142.255	and thought, well, that's just a webcam.
1143.763	What's special about it?
1144.834	If you could talk for just a moment
1146.525	about how you want to go past that?
1148.266	NG: So this is scalable
1148.266	video infrastructure,
1151.783	not for a few to a few but many to many,
1154.196	so that it scales
1154.196	to symmetrical video sharing
1157.206	and content sharing across these
1157.206	sites around the planet.
1160.344	So there's a lot of back-end
1160.344	signal processing,
1163.032	not for one to many, but for many to many.
1165.65	JC: Right, and then on a practical level,
1167.202	which technologies are you
1167.202	looking at first?
1168.913	I know you mentioned that a keyboard
1168.913	is a really key part of this.
1172.263	DR: We're trying to develop
1172.263	an interactive touch screen for dolphins.
1175.299	This is sort of a continuation
1175.299	of some of the earlier work,
1178.133	and we just got our first seed
1178.133	money today towards that,
1181.013	so it's our first project.
1182.386	JC: Before the talk, even. DR: Yeah.
1184.125	JC: Wow. Well done.
1185.476	All right, well thank you
1185.476	all so much for joining us.
1187.977	It's such a delight
1187.977	to have you on the stage.
1190.112	DR: Thank you. VC: Thank you.
1191.517	(Applause)
