12.844	Growing up in Kenya,
14.71	I knew I always wanted
14.71	to study biochemistry.
18.908	See, I had seen the impact of the high
18.908	prevalence of diseases like malaria,
24.463	and I wanted to make medicines
24.463	that would cure the sick.
27.585	So I worked really hard,
28.994	got a scholarship to the United States,
28.994	where I became a cancer researcher,
32.805	and I loved it.
34.432	For someone who wants to cure diseases,
36.543	there is no higher calling.
39.141	Ten years later, I returned
39.141	to Kenya to do just that.
43.021	A freshly minted PhD,
45.006	ready to take on this horrific illness,
47.231	which in Kenya was almost
47.231	certainly a death sentence.
51.421	But instead of landing a job
51.421	in a pharmaceutical company
54.396	or a hospital,
56.309	I found myself drawn
56.309	to a different kind of lab,
59.186	working with a different
59.186	kind of patient --
61.586	a patient whose illness was so serious
63.964	it impacted every single
63.964	person in my country;
67.438	a patient who needed to get healthy fast.
70.148	That patient was my government.
73.946	(Laughter)
75.922	See, many of us will agree that lots
75.922	of governments are unhealthy today.
80.696	(Laughter)
82.803	(Applause)
88.634	And Kenya was no exception.
90.795	When I returned to Kenya in 2014,
93.322	there was 17 percent youth unemployment.
96.605	And Nairobi, the major business hub,
98.977	was rated 177th on the quality
98.977	of living index.
103.076	It was bad.
106.09	Now, an economy is only as healthy
106.09	as the entities that make it up.
111.007	So when government --
112.181	one of its most vital entities --
113.95	is weak or unhealthy,
115.412	everyone and everything suffers.
118.342	Sometimes you might
118.342	put a Band-Aid in place
121.139	to try and temporarily stop the pain.
124.552	Maybe some of you here have participated
126.558	in a Band-Aid operation
126.558	to an African country --
129.561	setting up alternative schools,
129.561	building hospitals, digging wells --
134.067	because governments there
134.067	either weren't or couldn't provide
137.028	the services to their citizens.
139.72	We all know this is a temporary solution.
143.275	There are just some things
143.275	Band-Aids can't fix,
146.847	like providing an environment
146.847	where businesses feel secure
151.26	that they'll have an equal opportunity
153.095	to be able to run and start
153.095	their businesses successfully.
156.361	Or there are systems in place
158.199	that would protect the private
158.199	property that they create.
161.264	I would argue,
162.445	only government is capable of creating
162.445	these necessary conditions
165.913	for economies to thrive.
168.369	Economies thrive when business are able
168.369	to quickly and easily set up shop.
173.231	Business owners create new sources
173.231	of income for themselves,
176.627	new jobs get added into the economy
179.102	and then more taxes are paid
179.102	to fund public projects.
183.324	New business is good for everyone.
186.235	And it's such an important measure
186.235	of economic growth,
189.089	the World Bank has a ranking called
189.089	"the ""Ease of Doing Business Ranking,"""
193.064	which measures how easy
193.064	or difficult it is to start a business
196.125	in any given country.
197.746	And as you can imagine,
200.224	starting or running a business
200.224	in a country with an ailing government --
203.869	almost impossible.
206.252	The President of Kenya knew this,
206.252	which is why in 2014,
210	he came to our lab and asked
210	us to partner with him
213.393	to be able to help Kenya
213.393	to jump-start business growth.
217.509	He set an ambitious goal:
219.598	he wanted Kenya to be ranked top 50
219.598	in this World Bank ranking.
224.987	In 2014 when he came,
227.088	Kenya was ranked 136 out of 189 countries.
231.891	We had our work cut out for us.
235.412	Fortunately, he came to the right place.
238.137	We're not just a Band-Aid kind of team.
240.488	We're a group of computer scientists,
240.488	mathematicians, engineers
244.278	and a cancer researcher,
246.239	who understood that in order
246.239	to cure the sickness
248.709	of a system as big as government,
250.807	we needed to examine the whole body,
253.231	and then we needed to drill down
253.231	all the way from the organs,
256.342	into the tissues,
257.699	all the way to single cells,
259.225	so that we could properly
259.225	make a diagnosis.
262.582	So with our marching orders
262.582	from the President himself,
265.437	we embarked on the purest
265.437	of the scientific method:
268.574	collecting data --
269.773	all the data we could get our hands on --
271.884	making hypotheses,
273.165	creating solutions,
274.426	one after the other.
276.665	So we met with hundreds of individuals
276.665	who worked at government agencies,
280.724	from the tax agency, the lands
280.724	office, utilities company,
284.684	the agency that's responsible
284.684	for registering companies,
288.176	and with each of them, we observed
288.176	them as they served customers,
291.799	we documented their processes --
291.799	most of them were manual.
297.293	We also just went back and looked at
297.293	a lot of their previous paperwork
300.773	to try and really understand;
302.965	to try and diagnose what bodily
302.965	malfunctions had occurred
306.339	that lead to that 136th spot
306.339	on the World Bank list.
310.068	What did we find?
311.794	Well, in Kenya it was taking 72 days
315.889	for a business owner
315.889	to register their property,
318.857	compared to just one day in New Zealand,
321.278	which was ranked second
321.278	on the World Bank list.
324.647	It took 158 days to get
324.647	a new electric connection.
329.699	In Korea it took 18 days.
332.804	If you wanted to get a construction permit
334.881	so you could put up a building,
336.425	in Kenya, it was going
336.425	to take you 125 days.
340.02	In Singapore, which is ranked first,
340.02	that would only take you 26 days.
345.4	God forbid you had to go to court
347.468	to get help in being able to settle
347.468	a dispute to enforce a contract,
351.379	because that process alone
351.379	would take you 465 days.
356.885	And if that wasn't bad enough,
360.495	you would lose 40 percent
360.495	of your claim in just fees --
364.671	legal fees, enforcement fees, court fees.
368.928	Now, I know what you're thinking:
372.546	for there to exist such inefficiencies
372.546	in an African country,
376.237	there must be corruption.
378.311	The very cells that run the show
378.311	must be corrupt to the bone.
382.792	I thought so, too, actually.
384.804	When we started out,
385.981	I thought I was going to find
385.981	so much corruption,
389.493	I was literally going to either die
389.493	or get killed in the process.
393.013	(Laughter)
396.766	But when we dug deeper,
398.745	we didn't find corruption
398.745	in the classic sense:
401.926	slimy gangsters lurking in the darkness,
404.958	waiting to grease the palms
404.958	of their friends.
407.959	What we found was an overwhelming
407.959	sense of helplessness.
413.504	Our government was sick,
414.79	because government
414.79	employees felt helpless.
418.813	They felt that they were not
418.813	empowered to drive change.
422.42	And when people feel stuck and helpless,
426.788	they stop seeing their role
426.788	in a bigger system.
430.085	They start to think the work they do
430.085	doesn't matter in driving change.
434.578	And when that happens,
436.408	things slow down,
438.025	fall through the cracks
439.469	and inefficiencies flourish.
442.991	Now imagine with me,
444.78	if you had a process
444.78	you had to go through --
448.742	had no other alternative --
450.536	and this process was inefficient, complex
454.281	and very, very slow.
455.695	What would you do?
458.302	I think you might start by trying
458.302	to find somebody to outsource it to,
461.654	so that they can just
461.654	take care of that for you.
464.62	If that doesn't work,
467.127	maybe you'd consider paying somebody
469.161	"to just ""unofficially"" take care"
469.161	of it on your behalf --
472.565	especially if you thought
472.565	nobody was going to catch you.
476.61	Not out of malice or greed,
479.004	just trying to make sure that you get
479.004	something to work for you
482.119	so you can move on.
483.738	Unfortunately, that
483.738	is the beginning of corruption.
487.259	And if left to thrive and grow,
489.606	it seeps into the whole system,
491.196	and before you know it,
492.59	the whole body is sick.
496.416	Knowing this,
497.733	we had to start by making sure
499.312	that every single stakeholder
499.312	we worked with had a shared vision
503.913	for what we wanted to do.
506.012	So we met with everyone,
508.476	from the clerk whose sole job
508.476	is to remove staples
511.059	from application packets,
513.266	to the legal drafters
513.266	at the attorney general's office,
517.007	to the clerks who are responsible
517.007	for serving business owners
520.028	when they came to access
520.028	government services.
523.377	And with them,
524.551	we made sure that they understood
526.147	how their day-to-day actions
526.147	were impacting our ability as a country
530.918	to create new jobs
530.918	and to attract investments.
534.425	No one's role was too small;
534.425	everyone's role was vital.
539.907	Now, guess what we started to see?
542.814	A coalition of government employees
544.851	who are excited and ready to drive change,
546.987	began to grow and form.
549.747	And together we started
549.747	to implement changes
552.375	that impacted the service
552.375	delivery of our country.
556.405	The result?
557.853	In just two years,
559.918	Kenya's ranking moved from 136 to 92.
564.844	(Applause)
572.34	And in recognition of the significant
572.34	reforms we've been able to implement
576.753	in such a short time,
578.556	Kenya was recognized
580.461	to be among the top three
580.461	global reformers in the world
584.071	two years in a row.
586.518	(Applause)
592.984	Are we fully healthy?
595.376	No.
596.969	We have some serious work still to do.
600.156	I like to think about these two years
600.156	like a weight-loss program.
603.995	(Laughter)
606.341	It's that time after months
606.341	of hard, grueling work at the gym,
610.327	and then you get your first
610.327	time to weigh yourself,
612.781	and you've lost 20 pounds.
614.827	You're feeling unstoppable.
618.517	Now, some of you may think
618.517	this doesn't apply to you.
622.878	You're not from Kenya.
624.252	You don't intend to be an entrepreneur.
626.418	But think with me for just a moment.
629.134	When is the last time
629.134	you accessed a government service?
633.8	Maybe applied for your driver's license,
636.6	tried to do your taxes on your own.
642.464	It's easy in this political
642.464	and global economy
645.258	to want to give up when we think
645.258	about transforming government.
649.206	We can easily resign to the fact
649.206	or to the thinking
652.731	that government is too inefficient,
655.097	too corrupt,
656.277	unfixable.
658.347	We might even rarely get
658.347	some key government responsibilities
661.808	to other sectors,
663.032	to Band-Aid solutions,
664.225	or to just give up and feel helpless.
667.849	But just because a system is sick
667.849	doesn't mean it's dying.
672.509	We cannot afford to give up
675.34	when it comes to the challenges
675.34	of fixing our governments.
679.809	In the end,
682.502	what really makes a government healthy
682.502	is when healthy cells --
686.701	that's you and I --
689.654	get to the ground,
691.325	roll up our sleeves,
692.633	refuse to be helpless
694.762	and believe that sometimes,
696.582	all it takes is for us
696.582	to create some space
699.836	for healthy cells to grow and thrive.
702.601	Thank you.
703.782	(Applause)
