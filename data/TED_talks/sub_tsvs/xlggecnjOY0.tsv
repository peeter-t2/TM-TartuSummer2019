12.197	I would like to talk to you about a story
14.082	about a small town kid.
16.563	I don't know his name, but I do know his story.
20.238	He lives in a small village in southern Somalia.
23.314	His village is near Mogadishu.
27.344	Drought drives the small village into poverty
29.518	and to the brink of starvation.
31.386	With nothing left for him there,
33.222	he leaves for the big city,
35.049	in this case, Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia.
38.454	When he arrives, there are no opportunities,
41.284	no jobs, no way forward.
44.272	He ends up living in a tent city
46.296	on the outskirts of Mogadishu.
49	Maybe a year passes, nothing.
53.009	One day, he's approached by a gentleman
55.309	who offers to take him to lunch,
57.507	then to dinner, to breakfast.
60.583	He meets this dynamic group of people,
63.602	and they give him a break.
65.107	He's given a bit of money
66.426	to buy himself some new clothes,
68.528	money to send back home to his family.
71.064	He is introduced to this young woman.
73.037	He eventually gets married.
74.752	He starts this new life.
77.557	He has a purpose in life.
80.483	One beautiful day in Mogadishu,
83.257	under an azure blue sky,
86.145	a car bomb goes off.
88.666	That small town kid with the big city dreams
91.861	was the suicide bomber,
94.109	and that dynamic group of people
96.467	were al Shabaab, a terrorist organization
98.836	linked to al Qaeda.
102.517	So how does the story of a small town kid
105.389	just trying to make it big in the city
107.21	end up with him blowing himself up?
110.04	He was waiting.
112.012	He was waiting for an opportunity,
113.91	waiting to begin his future,
115.692	waiting for a way forward,
117.727	and this was the first thing that came along.
120.106	This was the first thing that pulled him out
122.52	of what we call waithood.
125.46	And his story repeats itself
127.756	in urban centers around the world.
130.172	It is the story of the disenfranchised,
132.926	unemployed urban youth
134.734	who sparks riots in Johannesburg,
138.677	sparks riots in London,
141.011	who reaches out for something other than waithood.
145.665	For young people, the promise of the city,
148.329	the big city dream is that of opportunity,
151.023	of jobs, of wealth,
153.178	but young people are not sharing
153.178	in the prosperity of their cities.
156.919	Often it's youth who suffer from
156.919	the highest unemployment rates.
161.017	By 2030, three out of five people living in cities
164.21	will be under the age of 18.
166.77	If we do not include young people
168.534	in the growth of our cities,
170.353	if we do not provide them opportunities,
172.832	the story of waithood,
174.854	the gateway to terrorism, to violence, to gangs,
177.767	will be the story of cities 2.0.
181.942	And in my city of birth, Mogadishu,
	suffer from unemployment.
191.171	don't go to school.
193.198	They pretty much do nothing.
195.623	I went back to Mogadishu last month,
199.139	and I went to visit Madina Hospital,
201.149	the hospital I was born in.
203.197	I remember standing in front of that
205.222	bullet-ridden hospital thinking,
208.2	what if I had never left?
210.233	What if I had been forced
211.426	into that same state of waithood?
213.945	Would I have become a terrorist?
217.956	I'm not really sure about the answer.
220.847	My reason for being in Mogadishu that month
223.015	was actually to host
224.562	a youth leadership and entrepreneurship summit.
227.109	I brought together about 90 young Somali leaders.
230.105	We sat down and brainstormed on solutions
232.351	to the biggest challenges facing their city.
235.227	One of the young men in the room was Aden.
238.629	He went to university in Mogadishu, graduated.
243.084	There were no jobs, no opportunities.
245.273	I remember him telling me,
246.991	because he was a college graduate,
249.799	unemployed, frustrated,
252.549	that he was the perfect target for al Shabaab
254.946	and other terrorist organizations, to be recruited.
257.998	They sought people like him out.
261.876	But his story takes a different route.
264.972	In Mogadishu, the biggest barrier
266.909	to getting from point A to point B are the roads.
270.162	Twenty-three years of civil war
271.945	have completely destroyed the road system,
274.176	and a motorbike can be the easiest way
276.185	to get around.
277.815	Aden saw an opportunity and seized it.
281.056	He started a motorbike company.
283.181	He began renting out motorbikes
285.472	to local residents who couldn't normally afford them.
288.772	He bought 10 bikes, with the help
290.793	of family and friends,
292.491	and his dream is to eventually expand
294.224	to several hundred within the next three years.
297.205	How is this story different?
299.773	What makes his story different?
302.13	I believe it is his ability to identify
304.96	and seize a new opportunity.
308.298	It's entrepreneurship,
310.329	and I believe entrepreneurship can be
312.088	the most powerful tool against waithood.
315.066	It empowers young people
316.836	to be the creators of the very economic opportunities
320.216	they are so desperately seeking.
322.714	And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
326.396	I want to talk to you about a young man
328.512	who attended one of my meetings,
330.801	Mohamed Mohamoud, a florist.
333.685	He was helping me train some of the young people
335.368	at the summit in entrepreneurship
336.805	and how to be innovative
338.427	and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship.
341.194	He's actually the first florist Mogadishu has seen
343.691	in over 22 years,
346.375	and until recently, until Mohamed came along,
349.639	if you wanted flowers at your wedding,
351.529	you used plastic bouquets
352.922	shipped from abroad.
354.508	If you asked someone,
356.314	"""When was the last time you saw fresh flowers?"""
358.589	for many who grew up under civil war,
361.175	"the answer would be, ""Never."""
363.958	So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
365.906	He started a landscaping and design floral company.
370.353	He created a farm right outside of Mogadishu,
373.661	and started growing tulips and lilies,
375.717	which he said could survive
377.423	the harsh Mogadishu climate.
380.134	And he began delivering flowers to weddings,
383.832	creating gardens at homes
385.765	and businesses around the city,
388.369	and he's now working on creating
390.106	Mogadishu's first public park in 22 years.
393.731	There's no public park in Mogadishu.
395.83	He wants to create a space where families,
398.159	young people, can come together,
399.81	and, as he says, smell the proverbial roses.
404.448	And he doesn't grow roses because
406.404	they use too much water, by the way.
410.528	So the first step is to inspire young people,
414.84	and in that room, Mohamed's presence
417.032	had a really profound impact
417.032	on the youth in that room.
420.508	They had never really thought
420.508	about starting up a business.
423.095	They've thought about working for an NGO,
424.942	working for the government,
426.629	but his story, his innovation,
430.936	really had a strong impact on them.
432.889	He forced them to look at their city
435.008	as a place of opportunity.
436.762	He empowered them to believe
436.762	that they could be entrepreneurs,
440.51	that they could be change makers.
442.93	By the end of the day, they were coming up
444.49	with innovative solutions
446.041	to some of the biggest challenges facing their city.
449.373	They came up with entrepreneurial solutions
451.976	to local problems.
454.898	So inspiring young people
457.129	and creating a culture of entrepreneurship
459.543	is a really great step,
461.41	but young people need capital
463.099	to make their ideas a reality.
464.888	They need expertise and mentorship
467.212	to guide them in developing
467.212	and launching their businesses.
470.612	Connect young people with the resources they need,
473.099	provide them the support they need
473.099	to go from ideation to creation,
476.564	and you will create catalysts for urban growth.
480.664	For me, entrepreneurship is more than just
483.588	starting up a business.
485.144	It's about creating a social impact.
487.525	Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
489.66	I believe he is selling hope.
492.147	His Peace Park, and that's what he calls it,
494.736	when it's created, will actually transform
496.908	the way people see their city.
498.98	Aden hired street kids to help rent out
501.133	and maintain those bikes for him.
502.995	He gave them the opportunity to escape
505.053	the paralysis of waithood.
507.989	These young entrepreneurs are having
510.019	a tremendous impact in their cities.
513.553	So my suggestion is,
516.069	turn youth into entrepreneurs,
518.585	incubate and nurture their inherent innovation,
521.808	and you will have more stories
521.808	of flowers and Peace Parks
525.647	than of car bombs and waithood.
528.74	Thank you.
531.56	(Applause)
