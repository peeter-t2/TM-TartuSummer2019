12.924	I live in Washington, D.C.,
17.112	but I grew up in Sindhekela, a village in Orissa,
17.112	in India.
24.479	My father was a government worker.
28.973	My mother could not read or write, but she
32.859	"would say to me, ""A king is "
32.859	worshipped only in his
38.303	"own kingdom. A poet is respected everywhere."""
44.441	So I wanted to be a poet when I grew up.
47.895	But I almost didn't go to college
52.077	until an aunt offered financial help.
56.609	I went to study in Sambalpur,
58.794	the largest town in the region,
62.989	where, already in college, I saw a
62.989	television for the first time.
69.988	I had dreams of going to the United States
72.148	for higher studies.
74.748	When the opportunity came,
76.877	I crossed two oceans, with borrowed money
79.212	for airfare and only a $20 bill in my pocket.
85.905	In the U.S., I worked in a research center,
90.512	part-time, while taking graduate classes in economics.
94.817	And with the little I earned, I would
100.151	finance myself and then I would send
102.458	money home to my brother and my father.
106.916	My story is not unique.
110.285	There are millions of people who migrate each year.
114.559	With the help of the family, they cross oceans,
118.34	they cross deserts, they cross 
118.34	rivers, they cross mountains.
125.155	They risk their lives to realize a dream,
129.483	and that dream is as simple as having a
132.156	decent job somewhere so they can send money home
135.467	and help the family,
137.297	which has helped them before.
141.954	There are 232 million international 
141.954	migrants in the world.
147.046	These are people who live in a country
148.395	other than their country of birth.
151.051	If there was a country made up of
152.76	only international migrants,
154.369	that would be larger, in population,
156.426	than Brazil.
157.863	That would be larger, in its size
159.868	of the economy, than France.
163.07	Some 180 million of them, from poor countries,
167.567	send money home regularly.
170.718	Those sums of money are called remittances.
175.743	Here is a fact that might surprise you:
184.453	was the amount of remittances sent last year
187.486	by migrants to developing countries.
190.522	Migrants from developing countries,
191.806	money sent to developing countries â€”
196.4	That's a remarkable number because
198.12	that is three times the size of
199.985	the total of development aid money.
203.799	And yet, you and I,
207.262	my colleagues in Washington,
208.768	we endlessly debate and
210.765	discuss about development aid,
213.193	while we ignore remittances as small change.
217.482	True, people send 200 dollars per month,
220.635	on average. But, repeated month after month,
224.706	by millions of people,
226.744	these sums of money add up to rivers 
226.744	of foreign currency.
230.811	So India, last year, received 72 
230.811	billion dollars, larger than
235.905	its IT exports.
238.361	In Egypt remittances are three times
241.345	the size of revenues from the Suez Canal.
244.917	In Tajikistan, remittances are 42 percent of GDP.
248.729	And in poorer countries, smaller 
248.729	countries, fragile countries,
251.568	conflict-afflicted countries, remittances are a lifeline,
256.637	as in Somalia or in Haiti.
260.013	No wonder these flows have huge
262.016	impacts on economies and on poor people.
266.916	Remittances, unlike private investment money,
270.725	they don't flow back at the first
273.752	sign of trouble in the country.
275.543	They actually act like an insurance.
278.428	When the family is in trouble,
280.848	facing hardship, facing hard times,
283.453	remittances increase, they act like an insurance.
285.52	Migrants send more money then.
288.079	Unlike development aid money,
289.674	that must go through official agencies,
292.251	through governments, remittances
295.368	directly reach the poor,
296.993	reach the family,
298.311	and often with business advice.
300.865	So in Nepal, the share of poor
304.045	people was 42 percent in 1995,
306.873	the share of poor people in the population.
309.06	By 2005, a decade later, at a
312.662	time of political crisis, economic crisis,
315.47	the share of poor people went down to 31 percent.
319.839	That decline in poverty, most of it,
323.115	about half of it, is believed to be
325.014	because of remittances from India,
327.741	another poor country.
329.88	In El Salvador, the school dropout
334.043	rate among children is lower
337.281	in families that receive remittances.
339.087	In Mexico and Sri Lanka,
341.056	the birth weight of children is higher
345.455	among families that receive remittances.
350.869	Remittances are dollars wrapped with care.
354.568	Migrants send money home for food,
357.289	for buying necessities, for building houses,
359.541	for funding education, for funding
361.929	healthcare for the elderly, for business
364.658	investments for friends and family.
366.916	Migrants send even more money home
369.255	for special occasions like a surgery
372.003	or a wedding. And migrants also send
375.767	money, perhaps far too many times,
378.707	for unexpected funerals that
381.103	they cannot attend.
385.001	Much as these flows do all that good,
387.679	there are barriers to these
389.077	flows of remittances, these
393.509	Foremost among them is
395.49	the exorbitant cost of sending money home.
399.796	Money transfer companies structure
401.793	their fees to milk the poor.
405.567	"They will say, ""Up to 500 dollars"
408.569	if you want to send, we will charge you
412.538	If you are poor and if you have 
412.538	only 200 dollars to send,
415.634	you have to pay that $30 fee.
418.876	The global average cost of sending
420.911	money is eight percent.
423.448	That means you send 100 dollars,
424.999	the family on the other side receives only
428.229	To send money to Africa,
430.013	the cost is even higher:
432.942	To send money within Africa,
434.916	the cost is even higher:
436.4	over 20 percent.
437.719	For example, sending money from Benin 
437.719	to Nigeria.
441.588	And then there is the case of Venezuela, where,
445.84	because of exchange controls,
447.321	you send 100 dollars and you
449.321	are lucky if the family on the other side
451.339	receives even 10 dollars.
454.749	Of course, nobody sends money to Venezuela
457.693	through the official channel.
459.316	It all goes in suitcases.
461.44	Whereever costs are high,
463.51	money goes underground.
465.893	And what is worse,
467.829	many developing countries actually
470.16	have a blanket ban on sending money
472.407	out of the country.
474.11	Many rich nations also have a
476.247	blanket ban on sending money 
476.247	to specific countries.
481.743	So, is it that there are no options,
483.854	no better options, cheaper options, to send money?
486.487	There are.
487.278	M-Pesa in Kenya enables people to send money
490.998	and receive money at a fixed cost of only
496.536	U.S. Fed started a program with Mexico
499.402	to enable money service businesses
501.041	to send money to Mexico
502.619	for a fixed cost of only 67 cents per transaction.
507.852	And yet, these faster, cheaper, better options
510.807	can't be applied internationally
513.794	because of the fear of money laundering,
516.635	even though there is little data
519.486	to support any connection, any significant
522.211	connection between money laundering
523.883	and these small remittance transactions.
529.273	Many international banks now
530.7	are wary of hosting bank accounts
533.589	of money service businesses, especially
536.99	those serving Somalia.
539.65	Somalia, a country where the
542.347	per capita income is only 250 dollars per year.
549.491	Monthly remittances, on average, to Somalia
551.907	is larger than that amount.
554.219	Remittances are the lifeblood of Somalia.
556.853	And yet, this is an example of
560.574	the right hand giving a lot of aid,
562.445	while the left hand is cutting the lifeblood
566.463	to that economy, through regulations.
572.064	Then there is the case of poor people
572.064	from villages, like me.
576.972	In the villages, the only place where you can
578.988	get money is through the post office.
581.72	Most of the governments in the world
583.713	have allowed their post offices to have
586.729	exclusive partnerships with money transfer companies.
589.965	So, if I have to send money to my
592.787	father in the village, I must send money
595.47	through that particular money transfer company,
597.773	even if the cost is high.
599.013	I cannot go to a cheaper option.
603.325	This has to go.
605.334	So, what can international organizations and
607.585	social entrepreneurs do to reduce the cost
609.602	of sending money home?
611.231	First, relax regulations on small remittances
611.231	under 1,000 dollars.
617.539	Governments should recognize that
619.961	small remittances are not money laundering.
624.208	Second, governments should abolish exclusive partnerships
628.647	between their post office and the money 
628.647	transfer company.
631.641	For that matter, between the post office
633.23	and any national banking system that
635.257	has a large network that serves the poor.
638.337	In fact, they should promote competition,
641.621	open up the partnership so that
644.65	we will bring down costs like we did,
647.799	like they did, in the telecommunications industry.
651.275	You have seen what has happened there.
654.272	Third, large nonprofit philanthropic organizations
659.075	should create a remittance platform
661.285	on a nonprofit basis.
662.868	They should create a nonprofit
663.94	remittance platform to serve the money transfer
666.14	companies so that they can send money at a low cost,
669.869	while complying with all the complex
672.02	regulations all over the world.
676.732	The development community should
678.134	set a goal of reducing remittance costs
680.411	to one percent from the current eight percent.
683.664	If we reduce costs to one percent,
685.924	that would release a saving of 
690.193	Thirty billion dollars, that's 
690.193	larger than the entire
694.594	bilateral aid budget going to Africa per year.
697.743	That is larger than, or almost similar to,
700.759	the total aid budget of the United States government,
703.928	the largest donor on the planet.
706.784	Actually, the savings would be larger
708.409	than that 30 billion because remittance channels
710.532	are also used for aid, trade and investment purposes.
715.939	Another major impediment to the
718.41	flow of remittances reaching the family
720.664	is the large and exorbitant
723.229	and illegal cost of recruitment,
726.207	fees that migrants pay, migrant workers
729.145	pay to laborers who found them the job.
732.409	I was in Dubai a few years ago.
736.015	I visited a camp for workers.
738.29	It was 8 in the evening, dark, hot, humid.
743.603	Workers were coming back from
745.415	their grueling day of work,
747.886	and I struck a conversation
749.67	with a Bangladeshi construction worker.
752.53	He was preoccupied that he is sending
755.439	money home, he has been
756.956	sending money home for a few months now,
759.866	and the money is mostly going
761.369	to the recruitment agent, to the labor agent
764.021	who found him that job.
765.664	And in my mind, I could picture
769.408	the wife waiting for
770.589	the monthly remittance.
772.315	The remittance arrives.
774.08	She takes the money and hands
775.809	it over to the recruitment agent,
779.379	while the children are looking on.
782.375	This has to stop.
785.705	It is not only construction 
785.705	workers from Bangladesh,
790.521	it is all the workers. There are millions of migrant
792.227	workers who suffer from this problem.
795.178	A construction worker from Bangladesh,
796.855	on an average, pays about 4,000 
796.855	dollars in recruitment fees
800.65	for a job that gives him only 2,000 
800.65	dollars per year in income.
806.029	That means that for the two years or three years
808.759	of his life, he is basically sending money
812.252	to pay for the recruitment fees.
813.536	The family doesn't get to see any of it.
817.049	It is not only Dubai, it is the dark
820.82	underbelly of every major city in the world.
823.394	It is not only Bangladeshi construction workers,
825.892	it is workers from all over the world.
828.047	It is not only men.
829.985	Women are especially vulnerable to
831.87	recruitment malpractices.
835.408	One of the most exciting and newest
840.002	thing happening in the area of remittances
842.42	is how to mobilize, through innovation,
845.461	diaspora saving and diaspora giving.
848.652	Migrants send money home,
850.535	but they also save a large amount of
852.168	money where they live.
854.613	Annually, migrant savings are estimated
857.248	to be 500 billion dollars.
861.349	Most of that money is parked in
863.577	bank deposits that give you zero percent interest rate.
867.302	If a country were to come 
867.302	and offer a three percent
870.394	or four percent interest rate, and then say
872.905	that the money would be used for building schools,
875.709	roads, airports, train systems
878.844	in the country of origin, a lot
880.656	of migrants would be interested in
882.593	parting with their money because
884.983	it's not only financial gains that
886.778	give them an opportunity
888.067	to stay engaged with their country's development.
893.539	Remittance channels can be used
895.48	to sell these bonds to migrants
900.051	because when they come
901.402	on a monthly basis to send remittances,
902.985	that's when you can actually sell
902.985	it to them.
905.566	You can also do the same
906.539	for mobilizing diaspora giving.
909.32	I would love to invest in a
912.158	bullet train system in India
914.538	and I would love to contribute to efforts
917.44	to fight malaria in my village.
921.356	Remittances are a great way of
925.345	sharing prosperity between places
929.116	in a targeted way that benefits
931.412	those who need them most.
934.348	Remittances empower people.
937.506	We must do all we can to make remittances
940.614	and recruitment
941.599	safer and cheaper.
943.751	And it can be done.
946.862	As for myself, I have been
948.962	away from India for two decades now.
952.982	My wife is a Venezuelan.
955.015	My children are Americans.
958.913	Increasingly, I feel like a global citizen.
962.86	And yet, I am growing nostalgic
965.19	about my country of birth.
968.142	I want to be in India and in the U.S. at the same time.
973.338	My parents are not there anymore.
975.561	My brothers and sisters have moved on.
979.063	There is no real urgency for me to send money home.
981.597	And yet, from time to time,
984.219	I send money home to friends,
987.07	to relatives, to the village,
989.911	to be there, to stay engaged â€”
992.147	that's part of my identity.
994.195	And, I'm still striving to be a poet
997.435	for the hardworking migrants
999.803	and their struggle to break free
1001.34	of the cycle of poverty.
1002.628	Thank you.
1004.402	(Applause)
