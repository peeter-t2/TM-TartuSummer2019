12.9	When my first children's book was published
14.57	in 2001,
16.293	I returned to my old elementary school
18.506	to talk to the students about being an author
20.446	and an illustrator,
22.162	and when I was setting up my slide projector
24.895	in the cafetorium,
28.1	I looked across the room,
30.148	and there she was:
32.759	my old lunch lady.
34.603	She was still there at the school
36.57	and she was busily preparing lunches for the day.
39.456	So I approached her to say hello,
41.1	"and I said, ""Hi, Jeannie! How are you?"""
42.987	And she looked at me, and I could tell
44.557	that she recognized me,
46.284	but she couldn't quite place me,
46.284	and she looked at me and she said,
49.369	"""Stephen Krosoczka?"""
52.13	And I was amazed that she knew I was a Krosoczka,
54.272	but Stephen is my uncle who
54.272	is 20 years older than I am,
57.703	and she had been his lunch lady when he was a kid.
60.84	And she started telling me about her grandkids,
63.345	and that blew my mind.
66.05	My lunch lady had grandkids,
67.844	and therefore kids,
68.808	and therefore left school at the end of the day?
72.063	I thought she lived in the cafeteria
73.806	with the serving spoons.
74.679	I had never thought about any of that before.
76.622	Well, that chance encounter inspired my imagination,
80.354	and I created the Lunch Lady graphic novel series,
83.905	a series of comics about a lunch lady
86.082	who uses her fish stick nunchucks
88.68	to fight off evil cyborg substitutes,
91.582	a school bus monster, and mutant mathletes,
94.889	and the end of every book,
96.356	they get the bad guy with their hairnet,
97.862	"and they proclaim, ""Justice is served!"""
101.616	(Laughter) (Applause)
105.869	And it's been amazing, because the series
108.476	was so welcomed into the reading lives of children,
111.369	and they sent me the most amazing letters
113.608	and cards and artwork.
115.765	And I would notice as I would visit schools,
118.239	the lunch staff would be involved in the programming
120.793	in a very meaningful way.
122.939	And coast to coast,
124.685	all of the lunch ladies told me the same thing:
126.78	"""Thank you for making a superhero in our likeness."""
130.675	Because the lunch lady has not been treated
133.444	very kindly in popular culture over time.
136.966	But it meant the most to Jeannie.
139.138	When the books were first published,
140.828	I invited her to the book launch party,
142.932	and in front of everyone there,
144.743	everyone she had fed over the years,
146.04	I gave her a piece of artwork and some books.
148.98	And two years after this photo was taken,
151.549	she passed away,
153.36	and I attended her wake,
154.447	and nothing could have prepared
154.447	me for what I saw there,
157.286	because next to her casket was this painting,
160.774	and her husband told me it meant so much to her
164.34	that I had acknowledged her hard work,
166.758	I had validated what she did.
169.624	And that inspired me to create a day
171.516	where we could recreate that feeling
173.766	in cafeterias across the country:
176.781	School Lunch Hero Day, a day where kids
178.434	can make creative projects for their lunch staff.
181.292	And I partnered with the
181.292	School Nutrition Association,
183.496	and did you know that a little over 30 million kids
186.624	participate in school lunch programs every day.
188.446	That equals up to a little over five billion lunches
191.798	made every school year.
193.305	And the stories of heroism go well beyond
195.691	just a kid getting a few extra chicken nuggets
197.678	on their lunch tray.
198.843	There is Ms. Brenda in California,
200.552	who keeps a close eye on every
200.552	student that comes through her line
203.341	and then reports back to the guidance counselor
205.826	if anything is amiss.
207.176	There are the lunch ladies in Kentucky
208.6	who realized that 67 percent of their students
211.235	relied on those meals every day,
213.208	and they were going without food over the summer,
215.324	so they retrofitted a school bus
217.348	to create a mobile feeding unit,
219.1	and they traveled around the neighborhoods
220.335	feedings 500 kids a day during the summer.
223.134	And kids made the most amazing projects.
225.729	I knew they would.
226.779	Kids made hamburger cards
228.391	that were made out of construction paper.
230.385	They took photos of their lunch lady's head
232.286	and plastered it onto my cartoon lunch lady
234.094	and fixed that to a milk carton
235.887	and presented them with flowers.
238.373	And they made their own comics,
240.376	starring the cartoon lunch lady
241.737	alongside their actual lunch ladies.
243.96	And they made thank you pizzas,
245.896	where every kid signed a different topping
247.811	of a construction paper pizza.
250.77	For me, I was so moved by the response
254.37	that came from the lunch ladies,
256.349	because one woman said to me, she said,
258.228	"""Before this day, I felt like I was"
260.763	at the end of the planet at this school.
263.2	"I didn't think that anyone noticed us down here."""
265.575	Another woman said to me,
267.442	"""You know, what I got out of this"
269.99	"is that what I do is important."""
272.944	And of course what she does is important.
275.284	What they all do is important.
277.388	They're feeding our children every single day,
280.777	and before a child can learn,
283.236	their belly needs to be full,
285.766	and these women and men
287.544	are working on the front lines to create
289.467	an educated society.
291.67	So I hope that
294.44	you don't wait for School Lunch Hero Day
296.341	to say thank you to your lunch staff,
298.376	and I hope that you remember
300.424	how powerful a thank you can be.
303.27	A thank you can change a life.
305.265	It changes the life of the person who receives it,
308.467	and it changes the life of the person
310.751	who expresses it.
312.377	Thank you.
314.733	(Applause)
