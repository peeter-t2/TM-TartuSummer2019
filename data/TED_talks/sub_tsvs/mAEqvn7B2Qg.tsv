16.023	Organic chemists make molecules,
18.638	very complicated molecules,
20.454	by chopping up a big molecule into small molecules
24.138	and reverse engineering.
25.999	And as a chemist,
27.038	one of the things I wanted to ask my research group a couple of years ago is,
30.505	could we make a really cool universal chemistry set?
34.656	"In essence, could we ""app"" chemistry?"
39.689	Now what would this mean, and how would we do it?
42.872	Well to start to do this,
44.843	we took a 3D printer
46.575	and we started to print our beakers and our test tubes on one side
50.877	and then print the molecule at the same time on the other side
54.942	and combine them together in what we call reactionware.
58.096	And so by printing the vessel and doing the chemistry at the same time,
62.53	we may start to access this universal toolkit of chemistry.
67.697	Now what could this mean?
69.245	Well if we can embed biological and chemical networks like a search engine,
74.513	so if you have a cell that's ill that you need to cure
77.662	or bacteria that you want to kill,
79.381	if you have this embedded in your device
81.712	at the same time, and you do the chemistry,
84.161	you may be able to make drugs in a new way.
87.762	So how are we doing this in the lab?
90.162	Well it requires software, it requires hardware
93.261	and it requires chemical inks.
95.627	And so the really cool bit is,
97.08	the idea is that we want to have a universal set of inks
100.127	that we put out with the printer,
102.396	and you download the blueprint, the organic chemistry for that molecule
106.678	and you make it in the device.
109.678	And so you can make your molecule in the printer using this software.
115.245	So what could this mean?
117.444	Well, ultimately, it could mean that you could print your own medicine.
122.391	And this is what we're doing in the lab at the moment.
124.36	But to take baby steps to get there,
126.262	first of all we want to look at drug design and production,
129.095	or drug discovery and manufacturing.
131.745	Because if we can manufacture it after we've discovered it,
134.744	we could deploy it anywhere.
136.878	You don't need to go to the chemist anymore.
138.994	We can print drugs at point of need.
141.362	We can download new diagnostics.
144.017	Say a new super bug has emerged.
146.028	You put it in your search engine,
147.645	and you create the drug to treat the threat.
150.778	So this allows you on-the-fly molecular assembly.
154.466	But perhaps for me the core bit going into the future
157.461	is this idea of taking your own stem cells,
160.811	with your genes and your environment,
162.578	and you print your own personal medicine.
166.027	And if that doesn't seem fanciful enough,
168.279	where do you think we're going to go?
170.327	Well, you're going to have your own personal matter fabricator.
174.911	Beam me up, Scotty.
176.811	(Applause)
