15.572	I collaborate with bacteria.
17.71	And I'm about to show you
18.592	some stop-motion footage that I made recently
20.772	where you'll see bacteria accumulating minerals
23.006	from their environment
24.556	over the period of an hour.
26.49	So what you're seeing here
27.855	is the bacteria metabolizing,
30.073	and as they do so
31.272	they create an electrical charge.
32.878	And this attracts metals
35.211	from their local environment.
37.378	And these metals accumulate as minerals
40.295	on the surface of the bacteria.
42.212	One of the most pervasive problems
44.379	in the world today for people
46.128	is inadequate access
47.545	to clean drinking water.
49.296	And the desalination process
50.962	is one where we take out salts.
52.746	We can use it for drinking and agriculture.
55.261	Removing the salts from water --
57.346	particularly seawater --
58.607	through reverse osmosis
60.211	is a critical technique
61.529	for countries who do not have access to clean drinking water
64.761	around the globe.
65.88	So seawater reverse osmosis
67.344	is a membrane-filtration technology.
69.511	We take the water from the sea
72.081	and we apply pressure.
73.612	And this pressure forces the seawater
76.536	through a membrane.
77.836	This takes energy,
79.271	producing clean water.
81.803	But we're also left with a concentrated salt solution, or brine.
85.504	But the process is very expensive
86.917	and it's cost-prohibitive for many countries around the globe.
89.551	And also, the brine that's produced
91.333	is oftentimes just pumped back out into the sea.
94.217	And this is detrimental to the local ecology
96.765	of the sea area that it's pumped back out into.
99.2	So I work in Singapore at the moment,
101.216	and this is a place that's really a leading place
103.983	for desalination technology.
105.984	And Singapore proposes by 2060
108.534	to produce [900] million liters per day
111.633	of desalinated water.
113.466	But this will produce an equally massive amount
116.816	of desalination brine.
118.569	And this is where my collaboration with bacteria comes into play.
121.767	So what we're doing at the moment
123.716	is we're accumulating metals
126.382	like calcium, potassium and magnesium
128.366	from out of desalination brine.
130.6	And this, in terms of magnesium
132.882	and the amount of water that I just mentioned,
135.432	equates to a $4.5 billion
138.382	mining industry for Singapore --
140.797	a place that doesn't have any natural resources.
143.331	So I'd like you to image a mining industry
145.981	in a way that one hasn't existed before;
148.07	imagine a mining industry
150.236	that doesn't mean defiling the Earth;
152.503	imagine bacteria helping us do this
154.614	by accumulating and precipitating
158.086	and sedimenting minerals
160.503	out of desalination brine.
162.352	And what you can see here
163.77	is the beginning of an industry in a test tube,
166.252	a mining industry that is in harmony with nature.
169.602	Thank you.
