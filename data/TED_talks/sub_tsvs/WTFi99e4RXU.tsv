12.786	I'm five years old, and I am very proud.
16.781	My father has just built the best outhouse
20.34	in our little village in Ukraine.
22.93	Inside, it's a smelly,
22.93	gaping hole in the ground,
26.479	but outside, it's pearly white formica
30.485	and it literally gleams in the sun.
34.113	This makes me feel so proud, so important,
37.67	that I appoint myself the leader
37.67	of my little group of friends
40.71	and I devise missions for us.
43.49	So we prowl from house to house
45.803	looking for flies captured in spider webs
49.17	and we set them free.
51.557	Four years earlier, when I was one,
53.865	after the Chernobyl accident,
55.31	the rain came down black,
57.641	and my sister's hair fell out in clumps,
59.841	and I spent nine months in the hospital.
62.398	There were no visitors allowed,
63.95	so my mother bribed a hospital worker.
67.962	She acquired a nurse's uniform,
70.693	and she snuck in every night
70.693	to sit by my side.
75.038	Five years later,
75.038	an unexpected silver lining.
78.098	Thanks to Chernobyl,
78.098	we get asylum in the U.S.
82.2	I am six years old, and I don't
82.2	cry when we leave home
86.419	and we come to America,
87.47	because I expect it to be
87.47	a place filled with rare
91.218	and wonderful things
91.218	like bananas and chocolate
95.398	and Bazooka bubble gum,
97.839	Bazooka bubble gum
97.839	with the little cartoon wrappers inside,
101.932	Bazooka that we'd get
101.932	once a year in Ukraine
105.049	and we'd have to chew
105.049	one piece for an entire week.
109.085	So the first day we get to New York,
110.891	my grandmother and I find a penny
113.124	in the floor of the homeless shelter
113.124	that my family's staying in.
116.867	Only, we don't know
116.867	that it's a homeless shelter.
118.402	We think that it's a hotel,
118.402	a hotel with lots of rats.
121.493	So we find this penny kind
121.493	of fossilized in the floor,
126.075	and we think that a very wealthy
126.075	man must have left it there
129.071	because regular people
129.071	don't just lose money.
131.565	And I hold this penny
131.565	in the palm of my hand,
134.122	and it's sticky and rusty,
136.784	but it feels like I'm holding a fortune.
139.815	I decide that I'm going
139.815	to get my very own piece
142.125	of Bazooka bubble gum.
143.94	And in that moment, I feel
143.94	like a millionaire.
147.925	About a year later, I get
147.925	to feel that way again
150.235	when we find a bag full
150.235	of stuffed animals in the trash,
152.994	and suddenly I have more toys
154.725	than I've ever had in my whole life.
157.469	And again, I get that feeling
157.469	when we get a knock
159.854	on the door of our apartment in Brooklyn,
161.831	and my sister and I find a deliveryman
164.14	with a box of pizza that we didn't order.
166.693	So we take the pizza,
166.693	our very first pizza,
169.882	and we devour slice after slice
172.721	as the deliveryman stands there
172.721	and stares at us from the doorway.
176.11	And he tells us to pay,
176.11	but we don't speak English.
179.11	My mother comes out,
179.11	and he asks her for money,
181.538	but she doesn't have enough.
182.896	She walks 50 blocks
182.896	to and from work every day
186.248	just to avoid spending money on bus fare.
188.917	Then our neighbor pops her head in,
190.783	and she turns red with rage
190.783	when she realizes
193.373	that those immigrants from downstairs
195.719	have somehow gotten
195.719	their hands on her pizza.
199.728	Everyone's upset.
201.284	But the pizza is delicious.
205.125	It doesn't hit me until years
205.125	later just how little we had.
211.086	On our 10 year anniversary
211.086	of being in the U.S.,
213.4	we decided to celebrate
213.4	by reserving a room
215.508	at the hotel that we first stayed
215.508	in when we got to the U.S.
218.39	The man at the front desk
218.39	laughs, and he says,
220.809	"""You can't reserve a room here."
220.809	"This is a homeless shelter."""
223.691	And we were shocked.
225.828	My husband Brian was also
225.828	homeless as a kid.
229.834	His family lost everything, and at age 11,
232.924	he had to live in motels with his dad,
235.677	motels
235.677	that would round up all of their food
238.61	and keep it hostage until they were
238.61	able to pay the bill.
242.29	And one time, when he finally got his box
244.495	of Frosted Flakes back, it
244.495	was crawling with roaches.
248.091	But he did have one thing.
250.007	He had this shoebox that he carried
250.007	with him everywhere
252.651	containing nine comic books,
255.114	two G.I. Joes painted
255.114	to look like Spider-Man
258.26	and five Gobots. And
258.26	this was his treasure.
261.323	This was his own assembly of heroes
264.318	that kept him from drugs and gangs
266.521	and from giving up on his dreams.
269.317	I'm going to tell you about one more
270.365	formerly homeless member of our family.
273.156	This is Scarlett.
274.855	Once upon a time, Scarlet
274.855	was used as bait in dog fights.
277.924	She was tied up and thrown into the ring
280.34	for other dogs to attack so they'd get
280.34	more aggressive before the fight.
284.376	And now, these days, she eats organic food
288.616	and she sleeps on an orthopedic
288.616	bed with her name on it,
291.307	but when we pour water
291.307	for her in her bowl,
295.559	she still looks up and she wags
295.559	her tail in gratitude.
299.548	Sometimes Brian and I walk
299.548	through the park with Scarlett,
302.766	and she rolls through the grass,
305.185	and we just look at her
307.586	and then we look at each other
309.406	and we feel gratitude.
313.413	We forget about all of our new
313.413	middle-class frustrations
317.044	and disappointments,
318.919	and we feel like millionaires.
321.603	Thank you.
322.753	(Applause)
