15.985	Like many of you, I'm one of the lucky people.
19.096	I was born to a family where education was pervasive.
22.496	I'm a third-generation PhD, a daughter of two academics.
26.734	In my childhood, I played around in my father's university lab.
30.528	So it was taken for granted that I attend some of the best universities,
34.377	which in turn opened the door to a world of opportunity.
38.178	Unfortunately, most of the people in the world are not so lucky.
42.298	In some parts of the world, for example, South Africa,
45.433	education is just not readily accessible.
48.138	In South Africa, the educational system was constructed
51.113	in the days of apartheid for the white minority.
53.986	And as a consequence, today there is just not enough spots
56.686	for the many more people who want and deserve a high quality education.
60.538	That scarcity led to a crisis in January of this year
64.418	at the University of Johannesburg.
66.254	There were a handful of positions left open
68.385	from the standard admissions process, and the night before
71.354	they were supposed to open that for registration,
73.914	thousands of people lined up outside the gate in a line a mile long,
77.966	hoping to be first in line to get one of those positions.
81.846	When the gates opened, there was a stampede,
84.154	and 20 people were injured and one woman died.
87.806	She was a mother who gave her life
89.746	trying to get her son a chance at a better life.
93.809	But even in parts of the world like the United States
96.966	where education is available, it might not be within reach.
101.322	There has been much discussed in the last few years
103.994	about the rising cost of health care.
105.983	What might not be quite as obvious to people
108.625	is that during that same period the cost of higher education tuition
112.647	has been increasing at almost twice the rate,
115.127	for a total of 559 percent since 1985.
119.407	This makes education unaffordable for many people.
123.941	Finally, even for those who do manage to get the higher education,
127.742	the doors of opportunity might not open.
130.367	Only a little over half of recent college graduates
133.574	in the United States who get a higher education
135.887	actually are working in jobs that require that education.
139.35	This, of course, is not true for the students
141.19	who graduate from the top institutions,
143.142	but for many others, they do not get the value
145.774	for their time and their effort.
149.31	Tom Friedman, in his recent New York Times article,
152.34	captured, in the way that no one else could, the spirit behind our effort.
156.708	He said the big breakthroughs are what happen
159.828	when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately necessary.
163.727	I've talked about what's desperately necessary.
166.348	Let's talk about what's suddenly possible.
168.86	What's suddenly possible was demonstrated by
171.979	three big Stanford classes,
173.547	each of which had an enrollment of 100,000 people or more.
177.427	So to understand this, let's look at one of those classes,
180.811	the Machine Learning class offered by my colleague
182.731	and cofounder Andrew Ng.
184.46	Andrew teaches one of the bigger Stanford classes.
186.779	It's a Machine Learning class,
187.988	and it has 400 people enrolled every time it's offered.
191.506	When Andrew taught the Machine Learning class to the general public,
194.771	it had 100,000 people registered.
197.387	So to put that number in perspective,
199.396	for Andrew to reach that same size audience
201.755	by teaching a Stanford class,
203.581	he would have to do that for 250 years.
207.507	Of course, he'd get really bored.
210.993	So, having seen the impact of this,
213.73	Andrew and I decided that we needed to really try and scale this up,
216.858	to bring the best quality education to as many people as we could.
220.978	So we formed Coursera,
222.473	whose goal is to take the best courses
225.61	from the best instructors at the best universities
228.927	and provide it to everyone around the world for free.
232.955	We currently have 43 courses on the platform
235.555	from four universities across a range of disciplines,
238.754	and let me show you a little bit of an overview
240.587	of what that looks like.
243.865	(Video) Robert Ghrist: Welcome to Calculus.
245.078	Ezekiel Emanuel: Fifty million people are uninsured.
246.958	Scott Page: Models help us design more effective institutions and policies.
250.229	We get unbelievable segregation.
252.637	Scott Klemmer: So Bush imagined that in the future,
254.429	you'd wear a camera right in the center of your head.
256.807	Mitchell Duneier: Mills wants the student of sociology to develop the quality of mind ...
261.061	RG: Hanging cable takes on the form of a hyperbolic cosine.
264.726	Nick Parlante: For each pixel in the image, set the red to zero.
267.797	Paul Offit: ... Vaccine allowed us to eliminate polio virus.
270.774	Dan Jurafsky: Does Lufthansa serve breakfast and San Jose? Well, that sounds funny.
274.397	Daphne Koller: So this is which coin you pick, and this is the two tosses.
278.013	Andrew Ng: So in large-scale machine learning, we'd like to come up with computational ...
281.7	(Applause)
287.309	DK: It turns out, maybe not surprisingly,
289.583	that students like getting the best content
291.821	from the best universities for free.
294.708	Since we opened the website in February,
297.23	we now have 640,000 students from 190 countries.
301.588	We have 1.5 million enrollments,
303.74	6 million quizzes in the 15 classes that have launched
306.59	so far have been submitted, and 14 million videos have been viewed.
311.506	But it's not just about the numbers,
314.024	it's also about the people.
315.665	Whether it's Akash, who comes from a small town in India
318.641	and would never have access in this case
320.816	to a Stanford-quality course
322.305	and would never be able to afford it.
324.82	Or Jenny, who is a single mother of two
326.858	and wants to hone her skills
328.825	so that she can go back and complete her master's degree.
331.96	Or Ryan, who can't go to school,
335.096	because his immune deficient daughter
336.961	can't be risked to have germs come into the house,
340.344	so he couldn't leave the house.
342.184	I'm really glad to say --
343.816	recently, we've been in correspondence with Ryan --
346.068	that this story had a happy ending.
348	Baby Shannon -- you can see her on the left --
349.903	is doing much better now,
351.254	and Ryan got a job by taking some of our courses.
355.452	So what made these courses so different?
357.696	After all, online course content has been available for a while.
361.416	What made it different was that this was real course experience.
365.128	It started on a given day,
366.854	and then the students would watch videos on a weekly basis
370.488	and do homework assignments.
372.343	And these would be real homework assignments
374.134	for a real grade, with a real deadline.
377.438	You can see the deadlines and the usage graph.
379.494	These are the spikes showing
381.582	that procrastination is global phenomenon.
385.371	(Laughter)
387.947	At the end of the course,
389.619	the students got a certificate.
391.475	They could present that certificate
393.635	to a prospective employer and get a better job,
395.788	and we know many students who did.
397.848	Some students took their certificate
399.767	and presented this to an educational institution at which they were enrolled
402.889	for actual college credit.
404.73	So these students were really getting something meaningful
406.944	for their investment of time and effort.
409.778	Let's talk a little bit about some of the components
412.333	that go into these courses.
414.225	The first component is that when you move away
416.853	from the constraints of a physical classroom
419.15	and design content explicitly for an online format,
421.99	you can break away from, for example,
424.518	the monolithic one-hour lecture.
426.933	You can break up the material, for example,
428.718	into these short, modular units of eight to 12 minutes,
432.094	each of which represents a coherent concept.
435.068	Students can traverse this material in different ways,
437.638	depending on their background, their skills or their interests.
441.342	So, for example, some students might benefit
443.862	from a little bit of preparatory material
446.622	that other students might already have.
448.693	Other students might be interested in a particular
451.133	enrichment topic that they want to pursue individually.
454.219	So this format allows us to break away
457.454	from the one-size-fits-all model of education,
460.278	and allows students to follow a much more personalized curriculum.
464.27	Of course, we all know as educators
466.613	that students don't learn by sitting and passively watching videos.
469.973	Perhaps one of the biggest components of this effort
472.918	is that we need to have students
475.51	who practice with the material
477.919	in order to really understand it.
481.075	There's been a range of studies that demonstrate the importance of this.
484.343	This one that appeared in Science last year, for example,
486.875	demonstrates that even simple retrieval practice,
489.707	where students are just supposed to repeat
492.499	what they already learned
493.899	gives considerably improved results
495.819	on various achievement tests down the line
498.088	than many other educational interventions.
502.392	We've tried to build in retrieval practice into the platform,
505.354	as well as other forms of practice in many ways.
507.608	For example, even our videos are not just videos.
511.752	Every few minutes, the video pauses
513.795	and the students get asked a question.
515.946	(Video) SP: ... These four things. Prospect theory, hyperbolic discounting,
518.167	status quo bias, base rate bias. They're all well documented.
521.259	So they're all well documented deviations from rational behavior.
524.026	DK: So here the video pauses,
525.65	and the student types in the answer into the box
527.906	and submits. Obviously they weren't paying attention.
531.144	(Laughter)
532.013	So they get to try again,
534.023	and this time they got it right.
536.559	There's an optional explanation if they want.
538.752	And now the video moves on to the next part of the lecture.
543.009	This is a kind of simple question
544.887	that I as an instructor might ask in class,
546.968	but when I ask that kind of a question in class,
550.768	are still scribbling the last thing I said,
555.955	and then there's the smarty pants in the front row
558.411	who blurts out the answer
559.77	before anyone else has had a chance to think about it,
561.977	and I as the instructor am terribly gratified
564.849	that somebody actually knew the answer.
566.497	And so the lecture moves on before, really,
569.289	most of the students have even noticed that a question had been asked.
572.818	Here, every single student
575.425	has to engage with the material.
578.209	And of course these simple retrieval questions
580.145	are not the end of the story.
581.807	One needs to build in much more meaningful practice questions,
584.777	and one also needs to provide the students with feedback
587.13	on those questions.
588.793	Now, how do you grade the work of 100,000 students
591.681	if you do not have 10,000 TAs?
594.763	The answer is, you need to use technology
597.117	to do it for you.
598.612	Now, fortunately, technology has come a long way,
601.26	and we can now grade a range of interesting types of homework.
604.528	In addition to multiple choice
606.055	and the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video,
609.208	we can also grade math, mathematical expressions
612.468	as well as mathematical derivations.
614.42	We can grade models, whether it's
617.294	financial models in a business class
619.47	or physical models in a science or engineering class
622.454	and we can grade some pretty sophisticated programming assignments.
626.198	Let me show you one that's actually pretty simple
628.117	but fairly visual.
629.597	This is from Stanford's Computer Science 101 class,
632.074	and the students are supposed to color-correct
633.678	that blurry red image.
635.27	They're typing their program into the browser,
637.288	and you can see they didn't get it quite right, Lady Liberty is still seasick.
641.346	And so, the student tries again, and now they got it right, and they're told that,
645.102	and they can move on to the next assignment.
647.461	This ability to interact actively with the material
650.609	and be told when you're right or wrong
652.293	is really essential to student learning.
655.419	Now, of course we cannot yet grade
657.694	the range of work that one needs for all courses.
660.528	Specifically, what's lacking is the kind of critical thinking work
663.829	that is so essential in such disciplines
665.751	as the humanities, the social sciences, business and others.
669.348	So we tried to convince, for example,
671.597	some of our humanities faculty
673.213	that multiple choice was not such a bad strategy.
675.909	That didn't go over really well.
678.1	So we had to come up with a different solution.
680.533	And the solution we ended up using is peer grading.
683.607	It turns out that previous studies show,
686.029	like this one by Saddler and Good,
687.701	that peer grading is a surprisingly effective strategy
690.189	for providing reproducible grades.
693.403	It was tried only in small classes,
695.173	but there it showed, for example,
696.66	that these student-assigned grades on the y-axis
699.142	are actually very well correlated
700.453	with the teacher-assigned grade on the x-axis.
702.749	What's even more surprising is that self-grades,
705.909	where the students grade their own work critically --
708.22	so long as you incentivize them properly
709.957	so they can't give themselves a perfect score --
711.895	are actually even better correlated with the teacher grades.
715.086	And so this is an effective strategy
716.693	that can be used for grading at scale,
718.797	and is also a useful learning strategy for the students,
721.533	because they actually learn from the experience.
723.788	So we now have the largest peer-grading pipeline ever devised,
728.437	where tens of thousands of students
730.941	are grading each other's work,
732.139	and quite successfully, I have to say.
735.208	But this is not just about students
737.468	sitting alone in their living room working through problems.
740.509	Around each one of our courses,
742.316	a community of students had formed,
744.476	a global community of people
746.356	around a shared intellectual endeavor.
748.888	What you see here is a self-generated map
751.54	from students in our Princeton Sociology 101 course,
754.501	where they have put themselves on a world map,
757.26	and you can really see the global reach of this kind of effort.
760.22	Students collaborated in these courses in a variety of different ways.
764.787	First of all, there was a question and answer forum,
767.426	where students would pose questions,
769.57	and other students would answer those questions.
771.994	And the really amazing thing is,
773.707	because there were so many students,
775.377	it means that even if a student posed a question
777.742	at 3 o'clock in the morning,
779.374	somewhere around the world,
780.956	there would be somebody who was awake
783.03	and working on the same problem.
785.343	And so, in many of our courses,
787.301	the median response time for a question
789.63	on the question and answer forum was 22 minutes.
793.048	Which is not a level of service I have ever offered to my Stanford students.
797.625	(Laughter)
798.966	And you can see from the student testimonials
800.908	that students actually find
802.595	that because of this large online community,
805.116	they got to interact with each other in many ways
807.715	that were deeper than they did in the context of the physical classroom.
811.908	Students also self-assembled,
814.252	without any kind of intervention from us,
816.115	into small study groups.
818.018	Some of these were physical study groups
820.38	along geographical constraints
822.206	and met on a weekly basis to work through problem sets.
824.928	This is the San Francisco study group,
826.828	but there were ones all over the world.
829.147	Others were virtual study groups,
831.179	sometimes along language lines or along cultural lines,
834.168	and on the bottom left there,
835.612	you see our multicultural universal study group
839.408	where people explicitly wanted to connect
841.171	with people from other cultures.
844.177	There are some tremendous opportunities
846.288	to be had from this kind of framework.
849.613	The first is that it has the potential of giving us
853.267	a completely unprecedented look
855.701	into understanding human learning.
857.99	Because the data that we can collect here is unique.
861.453	You can collect every click, every homework submission,
865.462	every forum post from tens of thousands of students.
869.825	So you can turn the study of human learning
872.168	from the hypothesis-driven mode
874.101	to the data-driven mode, a transformation that,
876.959	for example, has revolutionized biology.
880	You can use these data to understand fundamental questions
883.424	like, what are good learning strategies
885.304	that are effective versus ones that are not?
888	And in the context of particular courses,
890.24	you can ask questions
891.777	like, what are some of the misconceptions that are more common
895.032	and how do we help students fix them?
897.209	So here's an example of that,
898.633	also from Andrew's Machine Learning class.
900.649	This is a distribution of wrong answers
902.857	to one of Andrew's assignments.
904.467	The answers happen to be pairs of numbers,
906.36	so you can draw them on this two-dimensional plot.
908.631	Each of the little crosses that you see is a different wrong answer.
912.409	The big cross at the top left
914.815	is where 2,000 students
916.963	gave the exact same wrong answer.
920.008	Now, if two students in a class of 100
922.335	give the same wrong answer,
923.622	you would never notice.
924.973	But when 2,000 students give the same wrong answer,
927.533	it's kind of hard to miss.
929.23	So Andrew and his students went in,
931.422	looked at some of those assignments,
932.942	understood the root cause of the misconception,
937.03	and then they produced a targeted error message
939.55	that would be provided to every student
941.799	whose answer fell into that bucket,
943.978	which means that students who made that same mistake
946.062	would now get personalized feedback
948.088	telling them how to fix their misconception much more effectively.
952.487	So this personalization is something that one can then build
956.298	by having the virtue of large numbers.
959.438	Personalization is perhaps
961.75	one of the biggest opportunities here as well,
964.173	because it provides us with the potential
966.518	of solving a 30-year-old problem.
969.208	Educational researcher Benjamin Bloom, in 1984,
972.557	posed what's called the 2 sigma problem,
974.808	which he observed by studying three populations.
977.87	The first is the population that studied in a lecture-based classroom.
981.478	The second is a population of students that studied
984.255	using a standard lecture-based classroom,
985.974	but with a mastery-based approach,
988.054	so the students couldn't move on to the next topic
989.974	before demonstrating mastery of the previous one.
993.328	And finally, there was a population of students
995.622	that were taught in a one-on-one instruction using a tutor.
1000.15	The mastery-based population was a full standard deviation,
1003.422	or sigma, in achievement scores better
1005.71	than the standard lecture-based class,
1008.104	and the individual tutoring gives you 2 sigma
1010.248	improvement in performance.
1012.078	To understand what that means,
1013.541	let's look at the lecture-based classroom,
1015.374	and let's pick the median performance as a threshold.
1018.293	So in a lecture-based class,
1019.631	half the students are above that level and half are below.
1023.51	In the individual tutoring instruction,
1030.409	Imagine if we could teach so that 98 percent of our students
1034.329	would be above average.
1036.527	Hence, the 2 sigma problem.
1039.95	Because we cannot afford, as a society,
1042.349	to provide every student with an individual human tutor.
1045.421	But maybe we can afford to provide each student
1047.67	with a computer or a smartphone.
1049.689	So the question is, how can we use technology
1051.878	to push from the left side of the graph, from the blue curve,
1055.253	to the right side with the green curve?
1057.991	Mastery is easy to achieve using a computer,
1060.328	because a computer doesn't get tired
1061.733	of showing you the same video five times.
1064.806	And it doesn't even get tired of grading the same work multiple times,
1068.062	we've seen that in many of the examples that I've shown you.
1071.088	And even personalization
1072.942	is something that we're starting to see the beginnings of,
1075.078	whether it's via the personalized trajectory through the curriculum
1078.27	or some of the personalized feedback that we've shown you.
1081.534	So the goal here is to try and push,
1084.022	and see how far we can get towards the green curve.
1087.519	So, if this is so great, are universities now obsolete?
1092.878	Well, Mark Twain certainly thought so.
1095.87	"He said that, ""College is a place where a professor's lecture notes"
1098.415	go straight to the students' lecture notes,
1100.118	"without passing through the brains of either."""
1102.494	(Laughter)
1106.541	I beg to differ with Mark Twain, though.
1109.209	I think what he was complaining about is not
1111.874	universities but rather the lecture-based format
1114.624	that so many universities spend so much time on.
1117.408	So let's go back even further, to Plutarch,
1120.567	"who said that, ""The mind is not a vessel that needs filling,"
1122.794	"but wood that needs igniting."""
1124.817	And maybe we should spend less time at universities
1127.007	filling our students' minds with content
1129.578	by lecturing at them, and more time igniting their creativity,
1133.378	their imagination and their problem-solving skills
1136.633	by actually talking with them.
1139.131	So how do we do that?
1140.498	We do that by doing active learning in the classroom.
1143.929	So there's been many studies, including this one,
1146.378	that show that if you use active learning,
1148.458	interacting with your students in the classroom,
1150.874	performance improves on every single metric --
1153.57	on attendance, on engagement and on learning
1156.019	as measured by a standardized test.
1158.074	You can see, for example, that the achievement score
1159.938	almost doubles in this particular experiment.
1162.808	So maybe this is how we should spend our time at universities.
1167.209	So to summarize, if we could offer a top quality education
1171.786	to everyone around the world for free,
1173.689	what would that do? Three things.
1176.51	First it would establish education as a fundamental human right,
1179.931	where anyone around the world
1181.297	with the ability and the motivation
1183.218	could get the skills that they need
1185.169	to make a better life for themselves,
1186.754	their families and their communities.
1188.771	Second, it would enable lifelong learning.
1191.402	It's a shame that for so many people,
1193.353	learning stops when we finish high school or when we finish college.
1196.665	By having this amazing content be available,
1199.146	we would be able to learn something new
1201.889	every time we wanted,
1203.025	whether it's just to expand our minds
1204.354	or it's to change our lives.
1206.313	And finally, this would enable a wave of innovation,
1209.458	because amazing talent can be found anywhere.
1212.53	Maybe the next Albert Einstein or the next Steve Jobs
1215.538	is living somewhere in a remote village in Africa.
1218.153	And if we could offer that person an education,
1220.809	they would be able to come up with the next big idea
1223.165	and make the world a better place for all of us.
1225.569	Thank you very much.
1226.729	(Applause)
