25	About 15 years ago, I went to visit a friend in Hong Kong.
32	And at the time I was very superstitious.
36	So, upon landing -- this was still at the old Hong Kong airport
41	that's Kai Tak, when it was smack in the middle of the city --
44	"I thought, ""If I see something good, I'm going to have a great time here in"
49	"my two weeks. And if I see something negative, I'm going to be miserable, indeed."""
57	So the plane landed in between the buildings
59	and got to a full stop in front of this little billboard.
66	(Laughter)
67	And I actually went to see some of the design companies
71	in Hong Kong in my stay there.
73	And it turned out that --
75	I just went to see, you know, what they are doing in Hong Kong.
80	But I actually walked away with a great job offer.
84	And I flew back to Austria, packed my bags,
88	and, another week later, I was again on my way to Hong Kong
94	"still superstitions and thinking, ""Well, if that 'Winner' billboard is still up,"
101	I'm going to have a good time working here.
103	(Laughter)
104	"But if it's gone, it's going to be really miserable and stressful."""
110	So it turned out that not only was the billboard still up
114	but they had put this one right next to it.
116	(Laughter)
119	On the other hand, it also taught me where superstition gets me
123	because I really had a terrible time in Hong Kong.
125	(Laughter)
128	However, I did have a number of real moments of happiness in my life --
139	of, you know, I think what the conference brochure refers to
144	"as ""moments that take your breath away."""
147	And since I'm a big list maker, I actually listed them all.
154	(Laughter)
155	Now, you don't have to go through the trouble of reading them
158	and I won't read them for you.
161	I know that it's incredibly boring to hear about other people's happinesses.
165	(Laughter)
167	What I did do, though is, I actually looked at them from a design standpoint
176	and just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design.
182	And, very surprisingly, over half of them had, actually, something to do with design.
189	So there are, of course, two different possibilities.
192	There's one from a consumer's point of view --
194	where I was happy while experiencing design.
197	And I'll just give you one example. I had gotten my first Walkman.
201	This is 1983.
203	My brother had this great Yamaha motorcycle
206	that he was willing to borrow to me freely.
209	"And The Police's ""Synchronicity"""
212	cassette had just been released
214	and there was no helmet law in my hometown of Bregenz.
217	So you could drive up into the mountains
219	freely blasting The Police on the new Sony Walkman.
223	(Laughter)
224	And I remember it as a true moment of happiness.
229	You know, of course, they are related to this combination of
234	at least two of them being, you know, design objects.
238	And, you know, there's a scale of happiness when you talk about in design
242	but the motorcycle incident would definitely be, you know,
246	situated somewhere here -- right in there between Delight and Bliss.
252	Now, there is the other part, from a designer's standpoint --
258	if you're happy while actually doing it.
260	And one way to see how happy designers are when they're designing could be to
267	look at the authors' photos on the back of their monographs?
271	(Laughter)
272	So, according to this, the Australians and the Japanese
277	as well as the Mexicans
278	are very happy.
280	(Laughter)
281	While, somewhat, the Spaniards ...
283	and, I think, particularly, the Swiss
287	(Laughter),
289	don't seem to be doing all that well.
291	(Laughter)
299	Last November, a museum opened in Tokyo called The Mori Museum,
305	in a skyscraper, up on the 56th floor.
309	"And their inaugural exhibit was called ""Happiness."""
313	And I went, very eagerly, to see it, because --
317	well, also, with an eye on this conference.
321	And they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different areas.
331	"Under ""Arcadia,"" they showed things like this, from the Edo period --"
335	"a hundred ways to write ""happiness"" in different forms."
340	Or they had this apple by Yoko Ono -- that, of course, later on
344	was, you know, made into the label for The Beatles.
349	"Under ""Nirvana"" they showed this Constable painting."
353	And there was a little -- an interesting theory about abstraction.
357	This is a blue field -- it's actually an Yves Klein painting.
361	And the theory was that if you abstract an image, you really, you know
366	open as much room for the un-representable --
370	and, therefore, you know, are able to involve the viewer more.
376	"Then, under ""Desire,"" they showed these Shunsho paintings --"
380	also from the Edo period -- ink on silk.
386	"And, lastly, under ""Harmony,"" they had this 13th-century mandala from Tibet."
393	Now, what I took away from the exhibit was that
397	maybe with the exception of the mandala
400	most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness
406	and not about happiness.
408	And I felt a little bit cheated, because the visualization --
412	that's a really easy thing to do.
415	And, you know, my studio -- we've done it all the time.
418	This is, you know, a book.
420	A happy dog -- and you take it out, it's an aggressive dog.
424	It's a happy David Byrne and an angry David Byrne.
430	Or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face.
434	You know, that's not a big deal to accomplish.
438	It has gotten to the point where, you know, within advertising
443	"or within the movie industry, ""happy"" has gotten such a bad reputation that"
449	if you actually want to do something with the subject
452	and still appear authentic, you almost would have to, you know,
457	do it from a cynical point of view.
460	This is, you know, the movie poster.
463	Or we, a couple of weeks ago, designed a box set for The Talking Heads
468	where the happiness visualized on the cover definitely has, very much, a dark side to it.
479	Much, much more difficult is this, where the designs actually can evoke happiness --
488	and I'm going to just show you three that actually did this for me.
495	"This is a campaign done by a young artist in New York, who calls himself ""True."""
501	Everybody who has ridden the New York subway system will be
504	familiar with these signs?
507	True printed his own version of these signs.
511	Met every Wednesday at a subway stop with 20 of his friends.
516	They divided up the different subway lines and added their own version.
522	(Laughter)
523	So this is one.
525	(Laughter)
531	Now, the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs.
536	So you're
538	(Laughter)
539	you're really bored in the subway, and you kind of stare at something.
544	And it takes you a while until it actually --
546	you realize that this says something different than what it normally says.
550	(Laughter)
552	I mean, that's, at least, how it made me happy.
555	(Laughter)
566	Now, True is a real humanitarian.
570	He didn't want any of his friends to be arrested,
572	so he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card.
577	(Laughter)
580	And also gave this fake letter from the MTA to everybody --
584	sort of like pretending that it's an art project
587	financed by The Metropolitan Transit Authority.
589	(Laughter)
591	Another New York project.
594	This is at P.S. 1 -- a sculpture that's basically a square room
597	by James Turrell, that has a retractable ceiling.
601	Opens up at dusk and dawn every day.
604	You don't see the horizon.
605	You're just in there, watching the incredible, subtle changes of color in the sky.
612	And the room is truly something to be seen.
617	People's demeanor changes when they go in there.
622	And, for sure, I haven't looked at the sky in the same way
627	after spending an hour in there.
630	There are, of course, more than those three projects that I'm showing here.
635	"I would definitely say that observing Vik Muniz' ""Cloud"""
639	a couple of years ago in Manhattan for sure made me happy, as well.
643	But my last project is, again, from a young designer in New York.
648	He's from Korea originally.
649	And he took it upon himself to print 55,000 speech bubbles --
657	empty speech bubbles stickers, large ones and small ones.
660	And he goes around New York and just puts them, empty as they are, on posters.
665	(Laughter)
667	And other people go and fill them in.
670	(Laughter)
673	"This one says, ""Please let me die in peace."""
676	(Laughter)
683	I think that was --
685	the most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good.
690	This is on a musician poster, that says:
693	"""I am concerned that my CD will not sell more than 200,000 units"
697	and that, as a result, my recoupable advance
701	from my label will be taken from me,
703	after which, my contract will be cancelled,
705	"and I'll be back doing Journey covers on Bleecker Street."""
708	(Laughter)
727	I think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins.
732	Jee gets to have his project;
734	the public gets a sweeter environment;
738	and different public gets a place to express itself;
742	and the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads.
746	(Laughter)
753	Well, there was a question, of course, that was on my mind for a while:
759	You know, can I do more of the things that I like doing in design
764	and less of the ones that I don't like to be doing?
768	Which brought me back to my list making --
772	you know, just to see what I actually like about my job.
775	You know, one is: just working without pressure.
779	Then: working concentrated, without being frazzled.
783	Or, as Nancy said before, like really immerse oneself into it.
789	Try not to get stuck doing the same thing --
792	or try not get stuck behind the computer all day.
796	This is, you know, related to it: getting out of the studio.
800	Then, of course, trying to, you know, work on things
803	where the content is actually important for me.
806	And being able to enjoy the end results.
812	And then I found another list in one of my diaries that actually contained
820	all the things that I thought I learned in my life so far.
824	And, just about at that time, an Austrian magazine called and asked
829	if we would want to do six spreads -- design six spreads
833	that work like dividing pages between the different chapters in the magazine?
838	And the whole thing just fell together.
840	So I just picked one of the things that I thought I learned --
846	"in this case, ""Everything I do always comes back to me"" --"
849	and we made these spreads right out of this.
852	"So it was: ""Everything"
854	I do
856	always
858	comes
859	back
861	"to me."""
863	A couple of weeks ago, a
865	(Laughter)
867	French company asked us to design five billboards for them.
872	Again, we could supply the content for it.
875	So I just picked another one.
877	And this was two weeks ago.
879	We flew to Arizona -- the designer who works with me, and myself --
885	and photographed this one.
887	"So it's: ""Trying"
890	to look
891	good
893	limits
895	"my life."""
897	And then we did one more of these.
900	This is, again, for a magazine, dividing pages.
905	"This is: ""Having"" --"
906	this is the same thing;
907	it's just, you know, photographed from the side.
910	This is from the front.
911	"Then it's: ""guts."""
913	"Again, it's the same thing -- ""guts"" is just the same room, reworked."
918	"Then it's: ""always"
920	"works out."""
925	"Then it's ""for,"" with the light on."
928	(Laughter)
930	"And it's ""me."""
932	Thank you so much.
934	(Applause)
