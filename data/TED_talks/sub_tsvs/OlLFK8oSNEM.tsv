12.836	Some people are obsessed
12.836	by French wines.
16.302	Others love playing golf
18.548	or devouring literature.
20.729	One of my greatest pleasures
20.729	in life is, I have to admit,
24.328	a bit special.
25.946	I cannot tell you how much I enjoy
25.946	watching cities from the sky,
30.938	from an airplane window.
32.916	Some cities are calmly industrious,
35.935	like Dusseldorf
37.499	or Louisville.
39.78	Others project an energy
39.78	that they can hardly contain,
43.437	like New York
44.778	or Hong Kong.
46.524	And then you have Paris
49.492	or Istanbul,
51.228	and their patina full of history.
54.108	I see cities as living beings.
56.514	And when I discover them from far above,
59.006	I like to find those main streets
59.006	and highways that structure their space.
64.019	Especially at night,
65.519	when commuters make these arteries
65.519	look dramatically red and golden:
70.908	the city's vascular system
70.908	performing its vital function
75.219	right before your eyes.
77.569	But when I'm sitting in my car
81.02	after an hour and a half
81.02	of commute every day,
84.336	that reality looks very different.
86.237	(Laughter)
87.315	Nothing --
88.497	not public radio,
90.211	no podcast --
91.394	(Laughter)
92.446	Not even mindfulness meditation
94.479	makes this time worth living.
96.118	(Laughter)
98.072	Isn't it absurd
99.25	that we created cars
99.25	that can reach 130 miles per hour
103.731	and we now drive them at the same speed
103.731	as 19th-century horse carriages?
109.377	(Laughter)
110.66	In the US alone,
112.426	we spent 29.6 billion hours
112.426	commuting in 2014.
118.281	With that amount of time,
119.923	ancient Egyptians could have built
124.238	(Laughter)
125.308	We do that in one year.
126.73	A monumental waste of time,
126.73	energy and human potential.
132.154	For decades,
133.355	our remedy for congestion was simple:
135.687	build new roads or enlarge existing ones.
139.198	And it worked.
140.372	It worked admirably for Paris,
142.854	when the city tore down
142.854	hundreds of historical buildings
145.968	to create 85 miles
147.639	of transportation-friendly boulevards.
150.879	And it still works today
150.879	in fast-growing emerging cities.
154.549	But in more established urban centers,
156.969	significant network expansions
156.969	are almost impossible:
160.923	habitat is just too dense,
162.867	real estate, too expensive
164.864	and public finances, too fragile.
167.78	Our city's vascular system
167.78	is getting clogged, it's getting sick,
171.409	and we should pay attention.
173.04	Our current way
173.04	of thinking is not working.
176.172	For our transportation to flow,
178.117	we need a new source of inspiration.
182.187	So after 16 years
182.187	working in transportation,
185.437	"my ""aha moment"" happened"
185.437	when speaking with a biotech customer.
189.622	She was telling me how her treatment
191.674	was leveraging specific properties
191.674	of our vascular system.
195.582	"""Wow,"" I thought, ""Our vascular system --"
198.074	all the veins and arteries in our body
201.174	"making miracles of logistics every day."""
205.112	This is the moment I realized
207.294	that biology has been
207.294	in the transportation business
210.301	for billions of years.
212.364	It has been testing countless solutions
214.752	to move nutrients, gases and proteins.
218.532	It really is the world's most
218.532	sophisticated transportation laboratory.
223.326	So, what if the solution to our traffic
223.326	challenges was inside us?
229.895	I wanted to know:
231.184	Why is it that blood flows
231.184	in our veins most of our lives,
235.004	when our big cities get clogged
235.004	on a daily basis?
238.99	And the reality is that you're looking
238.99	at two very different networks.
244.013	I don't know if you realize,
246.223	but each of us has 60,000 miles
246.223	of blood vessels in our bodies --
252.262	That's two-and-a-half times
252.262	the Earth's circumference,
254.878	inside you.
256.86	What it means is that blood vessels
256.86	are everywhere inside us,
260.203	not just under the surface of our skin.
262.61	But if you look at our cities,
264.843	yes, we have some
264.843	underground subway systems
267.965	and some tunnels and bridges,
270.405	and also some helicopters in the sky.
272.709	But the vast majority of our traffic
272.709	is focused on the ground,
276.792	on the surface.
278.45	So in other words,
279.829	while our vascular system uses
279.829	the three dimensions inside us,
284.232	our urban transportation
284.232	is mostly two-dimensional.
287.881	And so what we need
287.881	is to embrace that verticality.
291.29	If our surface grid is saturated,
293.879	well, let's elevate our traffic.
296.174	This Chinese concept of a bus
296.174	that can straddle traffic jams --
300.694	that was an eye-opener on new ways
300.694	to think about space and movement
305.103	inside our cities.
306.863	And we can go higher,
308.699	and suspend our transportation
308.699	like we did with our electrical grid.
313.968	Tel Aviv and Abu Dhabi
313.968	are talking about testing
317.009	these futuristic networks
317.009	of suspended magnetic pods.
321.465	And we can keep climbing, and fly.
325.263	The fact that a company like Airbus
327.214	is now seriously working
327.214	on flying urban taxis
330.546	is telling us something.
332.633	Flying cars are finally moving
332.633	from science-fiction déjà vu
337.525	to attractive business-case territory.
340.238	And that's an exciting moment.
342.415	So building this 3-D
342.415	transportation network
345.068	is one of the ways we can mitigate
345.068	and solve traffic jams.
350.41	But it's not the only one.
352.257	We have to question
353.899	other fundamental choices
353.899	that we made, like the vehicles we use.
358.278	Just imagine a very familiar scene:
360.983	You've been driving for 42 minutes.
363.656	The two kids behind you
363.656	are getting restless.
366.899	And you're late.
368.754	Do you see that slow car in front of you?
371.474	Always comes when you're late, right?
373.316	(Laughter)
374.475	That driver is looking for parking.
377.193	There is no parking spot
377.193	available in the area,
379.434	but how would he know?
381.552	It is estimated that up to 30 percent
381.552	of urban traffic is generated
386.492	by drivers looking for parking.
389.091	Do you see the 100 cars around you?
391.549	Eighty-five of them
391.549	only have one passenger.
394.571	Those 85 drivers could all fit
394.571	in one Londonian red bus.
399.339	So the question is:
400.514	Why are we wasting so much space
400.514	if it is what we need the most?
403.598	Why are we doing this to ourselves?
405.746	Biology would never do this.
408.189	Space inside our arteries
408.189	is fully utilized.
411.722	At every heartbeat,
413.27	a higher blood pressure literally compacts
413.27	millions of red blood cells
417.307	into massive trains of oxygen
419.449	that quickly flow throughout our body.
421.771	And the tiny space inside our red
421.771	blood cells is not wasted, either.
426.357	In healthy conditions,
428.098	more than 95 percent
428.098	of their oxygen capacity is utilized.
432.494	Can you imagine if the vehicles
432.494	we used in our cities
435.379	were 95 percent full,
437.087	all the additional space
437.087	you would have to walk, to bike
440.495	and to enjoy our cities?
442.616	The reason blood is so
442.616	incredibly efficient
446.153	is that our red blood cells
446.153	are not dedicated
449.278	to specific organs or tissues;
451.497	otherwise, we would probably have
451.497	traffic jams in our veins.
454.632	No, they're shared.
455.888	They're shared by all
455.888	the cells of our body.
458.737	And because our network is so extensive,
461.414	each one of our 37 trillion cells
461.414	gets its own deliveries of oxygen
466.198	precisely when it needs them.
468.253	Blood is both a collective
468.253	and individual form of transportation.
473.513	But for our cities,
475.081	we've been stuck.
476.389	We've been stuck in an endless debate
478.458	between creating a car-centric society
478.458	or extensive mass-transit systems.
484.295	I think we should transcend this.
485.934	I think we can create vehicles
485.934	that combine the convenience of cars
490.277	and the efficiencies of trains and buses.
493.459	Just imagine.
494.888	You're comfortably sitting
494.888	in a fast and smooth urban train,
499.16	along with 1,200 passengers.
501.95	The problem with urban trains
503.661	is that sometimes you have to stop
503.661	five, ten, fifteen times
508.08	before your final destination.
510.421	What if in this train
510.421	you didn't have to stop?
513.929	In this train,
515.222	wagons can detach dynamically
515.222	while you're moving
519.012	and become express, driverless buses
521.518	that move on a secondary road network.
524.024	And so without a single stop,
525.949	nor a lengthy transfer,
527.56	you are now sitting in a bus
527.56	that is headed toward your suburb.
531.647	And when you get close,
533.597	the section you're sitting in detaches
536.928	and self-drives you
536.928	right to your doorstep.
540.523	It is collective and individual
540.523	at the same time.
543.922	This could be one of the shared,
543.922	modular, driverless vehicles of tomorrow.
549.681	Now ...
551.217	as if walking in a city
551.217	buzzing with drones,
554.399	flying taxis, modular buses
554.399	and suspended magnetic pods
558.71	was not exotic enough,
561.062	I think there is another force in action
563.023	that will make urban traffic mesmerizing.
566.541	If you think about it,
568.154	the current generation of driverless cars
568.154	is just trying to earn its way
573.184	into a traffic grid
573.184	made by and for humans.
576.626	They're trying to learn traffic rules,
576.626	which is relatively simple,
580.551	and coping with human unpredictability,
582.484	which is more challenging.
585.063	But what would happen
585.063	when whole cities become driverless?
588.999	Would we need traffic lights?
590.851	Would we need lanes?
592.471	How about speed limits?
594.563	Red blood cells are not flowing in lanes.
597.402	They never stop at red lights.
599.387	In the first driverless cities,
601.387	you would have no red lights and no lanes.
604.014	And when all the cars
604.014	are driverless and connected,
607.63	everything is predictable
607.63	and reaction time, minimum.
611.219	They can drive much faster
613.157	and can take any rational initiative
613.157	that can speed them up
616.118	or the cars around them.
618.6	So instead of rigid traffic rules,
622.203	flow will be regulated
623.559	by a mesh of dynamic and constantly
623.559	self-improving algorithms.
630.468	The result: a strange traffic
633.219	that mixes the fast and smooth
633.219	rigor of German autobahns
636.754	and the creative vitality
636.754	of the intersections of Mumbai.
640.695	(Laughter)
642.278	Traffic will be functionally exuberant.
644.257	It will be liquid like our blood.
646.722	And by a strange paradox,
648.502	the more robotized
648.502	our traffic grid will be,
651.337	the more organic and alive
651.337	its movement will feel.
655.075	So yes,
656.876	biology has all the attributes
656.876	of a transportation genius today.
660.598	But this process has taken
660.598	billions of years,
663.431	and went through all sorts
663.431	of iterations and mutations.
666.892	We can't wait billions of years
666.892	to evolve our transportation system.
670.979	We now have the dreams,
672.831	the concepts
674.147	and the technology
676.477	to create 3-D transportation networks,
679.351	invent new vehicles
681.09	and change the flow in our cities.
683.109	Let's do it.
684.288	Thank you.
685.476	(Applause)
