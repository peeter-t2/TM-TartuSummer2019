12.926	It would be nice to be
12.926	objective in life,
15.571	in many ways.
17.593	The problem is that we have
17.593	these color-tinted glasses
20.971	as we look at all kinds of situations.
25.65	For example, think about
25.65	something as simple as beer.
29.366	If I gave you a few beers to taste
31.548	and I asked you to rate them
31.548	on intensity and bitterness,
35.356	different beers would occupy
35.356	different space.
39.053	But what if we tried
39.053	to be objective about it?
41.81	In the case of beer,
41.81	it would be very simple.
43.97	What if we did a blind taste?
46.122	Well, if we did the same thing,
46.122	you tasted the same beer,
48.846	now in the blind taste,
48.846	things would look slightly different.
52.817	Most of the beers will go into one place.
55.039	You will basically not
55.039	be able to distinguish them,
57.484	and the exception, of course,
57.484	will be Guinness.
60.573	(Laughter)
62.801	Similarly, we can think about physiology.
65.587	What happens when people expect
65.587	something from their physiology?
68.629	For example, we sold people
68.629	pain medications.
71.137	Some people, we told them
71.137	the medications were expensive.
73.876	Some people, we told them it was cheap.
75.757	And the expensive
75.757	pain medication worked better.
78.729	It relieved more pain from people,
81.283	because expectations
81.283	do change our physiology.
84.787	And of course, we all know that in sports,
86.849	if you are a fan of a particular team,
88.667	you can't help but see the game
91.036	develop from the perspective of your team.
94.541	So all of those are cases in which
94.541	our preconceived notions
98.717	and our expectations color our world.
102.157	But what happened
102.157	in more important questions?
105.559	What happened with questions
105.559	that had to do with social justice?
109.111	So we wanted to think about
109.111	what is the blind tasting version
112.516	for thinking about inequality?
115.581	So we started looking at inequality,
117.88	and we did some large-scale surveys
119.83	around the U.S. and other countries.
122.384	So we asked two questions:
124.335	Do people know what kind of
124.335	level of inequality we have?
127.701	And then, what level of inequality
127.701	do we want to have?
131.812	So let's think about the first question.
134.226	Imagine I took all the people in the U.S.
136.339	and I sorted them from
136.339	the poorest on the right
139.264	to the richest on the left,
141.656	and then I divided them into five buckets:
144.318	the poorest 20 percent,
144.318	the next 20 percent,
146.616	the next, the next,
146.616	and the richest 20 percent.
149.472	And then I asked you to tell me
149.472	how much wealth do you think
152.468	is concentrated in each of those buckets.
155.417	So to make it simpler,
155.417	imagine I ask you to tell me,
157.878	how much wealth do you think
157.878	is concentrated
160.138	in the bottom two buckets,
162.398	the bottom 40 percent?
164.659	Take a second. Think about it
164.659	and have a number.
167.351	Usually we don't think.
169.255	Think for a second,
169.255	have a real number in your mind.
171.74	You have it?
173.365	Okay, here's what lots
173.365	of Americans tell us.
176.43	They think that the bottom 20 percent
178.357	has about 2.9 percent of the wealth,
180.679	the next group has 6.4,
182.862	so together it's slightly more than nine.
185.369	The next group, they say, has 12 percent,
190.431	and the richest 20 percent, people think
190.431	has 58 percent of the wealth.
195.075	You can see how this relates
195.075	to what you thought.
198.21	Now, what's reality?
199.951	Reality is slightly different.
201.762	The bottom 20 percent
201.762	has 0.1 percent of the wealth.
205.575	The next 20 percent
205.575	has 0.2 percent of the wealth.
208.826	Together, it's 0.3.
210.939	The next group has 3.9,
216.651	and the richest group
216.651	has 84-85 percent of the wealth.
222.392	So what we actually have
222.392	and what we think we have
225.358	are very different.
227.331	What about what we want?
229.421	How do we even figure this out?
231.418	So to look at this,
232.829	to look at what we really want,
234.407	we thought about
234.407	the philosopher John Rawls.
237.472	If you remember John Rawls,
239.307	he had this notion
239.307	of what's a just society.
242.557	He said a just society
244.039	is a society that if
244.039	you knew everything about it,
246.754	you would be willing
246.754	to enter it in a random place.
249.187	And it's a beautiful definition,
250.711	because if you're wealthy,
250.711	you might want the wealthy
253.189	to have more money, the poor to have less.
255.226	If you're poor, you might
255.226	want more equality.
257.335	But if you're going
257.335	to go into that society
259.339	in every possible situation,
259.339	and you don't know,
262.659	you have to consider all the aspects.
264.865	It's a little bit like blind tasting
264.865	in which you don't know
267.791	what the outcome will be
267.791	when you make a decision,
270.461	and Rawls called this
270.461	"the ""veil of ignorance."""
274.176	So, we took another group,
274.176	a large group of Americans,
277.783	and we asked them the question
277.783	in the veil of ignorance.
280.538	What are the characteristics of a country
280.538	that would make you want to join it,
284.648	knowing that you could end
284.648	randomly at any place?
287.806	And here is what we got.
289.285	What did people want to give
289.285	to the first group,
291.544	the bottom 20 percent?
293.727	They wanted to give them
293.727	about 10 percent of the wealth.
296.421	The next group, 14 percent of the wealth,
304.384	Now, nobody in our sample
304.384	wanted full equality.
307.89	Nobody thought that socialism
307.89	is a fantastic idea in our sample.
312.323	But what does it mean?
313.611	It means that we have this knowledge gap
315.649	between what we have
315.649	and what we think we have,
318.307	but we have at least as big a gap
318.307	between what we think is right
322.022	to what we think we have.
324.82	Now, we can ask these questions,
324.82	by the way, not just about wealth.
328.012	We can ask it about other things as well.
330.427	So for example, we asked people
330.427	from different parts of the world
334.63	about this question,
336.348	people who are liberals and conservatives,
338.691	and they gave us basically 
338.691	the same answer.
340.735	We asked rich and poor,
340.735	they gave us the same answer,
343.217	men and women,
344.518	NPR listeners and Forbes readers.
347.211	We asked people in England,
347.211	Australia, the U.S. --
350.44	very similar answers.
352.157	We even asked different
352.157	departments of a university.
354.928	We went to Harvard and we checked
354.928	almost every department,
357.686	and in fact, from Harvard Business School,
359.698	where a few people wanted the wealthy
359.698	to have more and the [poor] to have less,
363.41	the similarity was astonishing.
365.95	I know some of you went
365.95	to Harvard Business School.
368.774	We also asked this question
368.774	about something else.
372.12	We asked, what about the ratio
372.12	of CEO pay to unskilled workers?
377.089	So you can see what
377.089	people think is the ratio,
380.246	and then we can ask the question,
380.246	what do they think should be the ratio?
384.147	And then we can ask, what is reality?
386.774	What is reality? And you could say,
386.774	well, it's not that bad, right?
390.052	The red and the yellow
390.052	are not that different.
392.205	But the fact is, it's because
392.205	I didn't draw them on the same scale.
398.105	It's hard to see, there's yellow
398.105	and blue in there.
402.015	So what about other outcomes of wealth?
404.36	Wealth is not just about wealth.
406.055	We asked, what about things like health?
408.679	What about availability
408.679	of prescription medication?
412.812	What about life expectancy?
414.832	What about life expectancy of infants?
417.247	How do we want this to be distributed?
419.592	What about education for young people?
422.401	And for older people?
424.271	And across all of those things,
424.271	what we learned was that people
427.254	don't like inequality of wealth,
430.412	but there's other things where inequality,
430.412	which is an outcome of wealth,
433.918	is even more aversive to them:
435.961	for example, inequality
435.961	in health or education.
439.932	We also learned that people
439.932	are particularly open
442.393	to changes in equality
442.393	when it comes to people
444.947	who have less agency --
446.991	basically, young kids and babies,
449.336	because we don't think of them
449.336	as responsible for their situation.
454.003	So what are some lessons from this?
456.348	We have two gaps:
457.508	We have a knowledge gap
457.508	and we have a desirability gap
460.088	And the knowledge gap
460.088	is something that we think about,
462.71	how do we educate people?
464.08	How do we get people to think
464.08	differently about inequality
466.796	and the consequences of inequality
466.796	in terms of health, education,
470.558	jealousy, crime rate, and so on?
472.949	Then we have the desirability gap.
474.83	How do we get people to think differently
474.83	about what we really want?
478.653	You see, the Rawls definition,
478.653	the Rawls way of looking at the world,
482.028	the blind tasting approach,
483.77	takes our selfish motivation
483.77	out of the picture.
486.695	How do we implement that
486.695	to a higher degree
489.272	on a more extensive scale?
491.896	And finally, we also have an action gap.
494.752	How do we take these things
494.752	and actually do something about it?
497.701	I think part of the answer
497.701	is to think about people
500.603	like young kids and babies
500.603	that don't have much agency,
503.715	because people seem to be
503.715	more willing to do this.
507.523	To summarize, I would say,
507.523	next time you go to drink beer or wine,
512.793	first of all, think about, what is it
512.793	in your experience that is real,
516.88	and what is it in your experience
516.88	that is a placebo effect
520.154	coming from expectations?
521.758	And then think about what it also means
521.758	for other decisions in your life,
525.287	and hopefully also for policy questions
527.362	that affect all of us.
528.667	Thanks a lot.
530.394	(Applause)
