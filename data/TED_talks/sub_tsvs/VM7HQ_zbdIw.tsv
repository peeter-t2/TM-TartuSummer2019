20.624	In the 1980s, in communist
20.624	Eastern Germany,
27.349	if you owned a typewriter,
30.547	you had to register it
30.547	with the government.
33.372	You had to register a sample sheet of text
33.372	out of the typewriter.
38.86	And this was done
38.86	so the government could track
42.435	where the text was coming from.
44.204	If they found a paper
44.204	which had the wrong kind of thought,
49.923	they could track down
49.923	who created that thought.
54.369	And we in the West
57.154	couldn't understand
57.154	how anybody would do this,
59.86	how much this would restrict
59.86	freedom of speech.
63.061	We would never do that
63.061	in our own countries.
68.319	But today, in 2011, if you go
68.319	and buy a color laser printer
74.76	from any major laser printer manufacturer
78.623	and print a page,
80.084	that page will end up
81.86	having slight yellow dots
81.86	printed on every single page,
87.104	in a pattern which makes the page unique
87.104	to you and to your printer.
94.381	This is happening to us today.
99.358	And nobody seems
99.358	to be making a fuss about it.
103.615	And this is an example
106.303	of the ways our own governments
106.303	are using technology
113.179	against us, the citizens.
117.179	And this is one of the main three sources
117.179	of online problems today.
121.537	If we look at what's really
121.537	happening in the online world,
124.551	we can group the attacks
124.551	based on the attackers.
128.028	We have three main groups.
129.86	We have online criminals.
131.323	Like here, we have Mr. Dmitry Golubov,
133.55	from the city of Kiev in Ukraine.
136.419	And the motives of online criminals
136.419	are very easy to understand.
140.86	These guys make money.
142.478	They use online attacks
142.478	to make lots of money --
146.756	and lots and lots of it.
148.757	We actually have several cases
148.757	of millionaires online, multimillionaires,
154.166	who made money with their attacks.
155.95	Here's Vladimir Tsastsin,
155.95	from Tartu in Estonia.
159.476	This is [Albert] Gonzalez.
161.295	This is Stephen Watt.
163.094	This is Bjorn Sundin.
164.916	This is Matthew Anderson, Tariq Al-Daour
166.881	and so on and so on.
170.256	These guys make their fortunes online,
174.499	but they make it through the illegal means
176.86	of using things like banking Trojans
179.579	to steal money from our bank accounts
179.579	while we do online banking,
183.056	or with keyloggers
185.33	to collect our credit card information
187.612	while we are doing online shopping
187.612	from an infected computer.
191.197	The US Secret Service,
193.575	two months ago,
193.575	froze the Swiss bank account
196.621	of Mr. Sam Jain right here,
199.226	and that bank account
199.226	had 14.9 million US dollars in it
202.962	when it was frozen.
204.377	Mr. Jain himself is on the loose;
204.377	nobody knows where he is.
208.637	And I claim it's already today
212.335	that it's more likely for any of us
212.335	to become the victim of a crime online
218.081	than here in the real world.
221.691	And it's very obvious
221.691	that this is only going to get worse.
224.66	In the future, the majority of crime
224.66	will be happening online.
231.488	The second major group of attackers
231.488	that we are watching today
234.86	are not motivated by money.
237.143	They're motivated by something else --
239.27	motivated by protests,
241.271	motivated by an opinion,
243.507	motivated by the laughs.
245.702	Groups like Anonymous
245.702	have risen up over the last 12 months
251.251	and have become a major player
251.251	in the field of online attacks.
256.287	So those are the three main attackers:
258.143	criminals who do it for the money,
260.222	hacktivists like Anonymous
260.222	doing it for the protest,
264.745	but then the last group
264.745	are nation states --
267.971	governments doing the attacks.
272.551	And then we look at cases
272.551	like what happened in DigiNotar.
276.068	This is a prime example of what happens
276.068	when governments attack
279.978	against their own citizens.
282.412	DigiNotar is a certificate
282.412	authority from the Netherlands --
287.423	or actually, it was.
289.023	It was running into bankruptcy last fall,
294.269	because they were hacked into.
296.061	Somebody broke in
296.061	and they hacked it thoroughly.
300.591	And I asked last week,
303.19	in a meeting with Dutch
303.19	government representatives,
307.337	I asked one of the leaders of the team
312.15	whether he found plausible
312.15	that people died
317.504	because of the DigiNotar hack.
321.447	And his answer was: yes.
326.073	So how do people die
328.136	as the result of a hack like this?
331.049	Well, DigiNotar is a CA.
332.86	They sell certificates.
334.86	What do you do with certificates?
336.49	Well, you need a certificate
336.49	if you have a website
339.056	that has https, SSL encrypted services,
343.725	services like Gmail.
347.363	Now we all, or a big part of us,
347.363	use Gmail or one of their competitors,
351.048	but these services are especially popular
351.048	in totalitarian states like Iran,
356.86	where dissidents
356.86	use foreign services like Gmail
361.86	because they know they are more
361.86	trustworthy than the local services
365.075	and they are encrypted
365.075	over SSL connections,
367.86	so the local government
367.86	can't snoop on their discussions.
372.196	Except they can,
373.564	if they hack into a foreign CA
373.564	and issue rogue certificates.
377.439	And this is exactly what happened
377.439	with the case of DigiNotar.
385.109	What about Arab Spring
387.125	and things that have been happening,
387.125	for example, in Egypt?
390.46	Well, in Egypt,
391.827	the rioters looted the headquarters
391.827	of the Egyptian secret police
395.558	in April 2011,
398.172	and when they were looting the building,
398.172	they found lots of papers.
401.34	Among those papers
401.34	"was this binder entitled, ""FinFisher."""
405.221	And within that binder were notes
405.221	from a company based in Germany,
410.081	which had sold to the Egyptian government
413.627	a set of tools for intercepting,
413.627	at a very large scale,
418.354	all the communication
418.354	of the citizens of the country.
421.429	They had sold this tool for 280,000 euros
421.429	to the Egyptian government.
426.329	The company headquarters are right here.
429.273	So Western governments are providing
429.273	totalitarian governments with tools
433.714	to do this against their own citizens.
437.293	But Western governments
437.293	are doing it to themselves as well.
440.294	For example, in Germany,
442.489	just a couple of weeks ago,
442.489	"the so-called ""State Trojan"" was found,"
447.076	which was a Trojan used
447.076	by German government officials
450.852	to investigate their own citizens.
453.079	If you are a suspect in a criminal case,
456.807	well, it's pretty obvious,
456.807	your phone will be tapped.
459.356	But today, it goes beyond that.
461.622	They will tap your Internet connection.
463.565	They will even use tools like State Trojan
466.325	to infect your computer with a Trojan,
468.861	which enables them
468.861	to watch all your communication,
473.251	to listen to your online discussions,
476.092	to collect your passwords.
481.816	Now, when we think deeper
481.816	about things like these,
487.06	the obvious response
487.06	from people should be,
492.398	"""OK, well, that sounds bad,"
492.398	but that doesn't really affect me,
496.664	because I'm a legal citizen.
498.864	Why should I worry?
498.864	"Because I have nothing to hide."""
503.373	And this is an argument
503.373	which doesn't make sense.
507.237	Privacy is implied.
510.07	Privacy is not up for discussion.
514.538	This is not a question
516.434	between privacy
521.007	against security.
523.729	It's a question of freedom
527.308	against control.
530.046	And while we might trust our governments
530.046	right now, right here in 2011,
536.933	any rights we give away
536.933	will be given away for good.
540.396	And do we trust, do we blindly trust,
540.396	any future government,
545.001	a government we might have
551.46	And these are the questions
554.27	that we have to worry about
554.27	for the next 50 years.
