15.33	Everybody in our society's life is touched by cancer --
18.33	if not personally,
20.33	then through a loved one, a family member,
23.33	colleague, friend.
25.33	And once our lives are touched by cancer,
28.33	we quickly learn
30.33	that there are basically
32.33	three weapons, or three tools, that are available
35.33	to fight the disease:
38.33	surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.
41.33	And once we get involved
44.33	in the therapeutic decisions,
47.33	again either personally
49.33	or with our loved ones and family members,
52.33	we also very quickly learn
55.33	the benefits, the trade-offs and the limitations
58.33	of these tools.
60.33	I'm very thankful to Jay and to Mark
62.33	and the TEDMED team
64.33	for inviting me today
66.33	to describe a fourth tool, a new tool,
69.33	that we call Tumor Treating Fields.
72.33	Tumor Treating Fields
74.33	were invented by Dr. Yoram Palti,
77.33	professor emeritus at the Technion in Israel.
80.33	And they use low-intensity
82.33	electric fields
84.33	to fight cancer.
86.33	To understand how Tumor Treating Fields work,
89.33	we first need to understand
91.33	what are electric fields.
93.33	Let me first address
96.33	a few popular misconceptions.
99.33	First of all, electric fields
101.33	are not an electric current
103.33	that is coursing through the tissue.
106.33	Electric fields
108.33	are not ionizing radiation,
110.33	like X-rays or proton beams,
112.33	that bombard tissue
114.33	to disrupt DNA.
116.33	And electric fields
118.33	are not magnetism.
120.33	What electric fields are
122.33	are a field of forces.
125.33	And these forces
127.33	act on, attract, bodies
130.33	that have an electrical charge.
133.33	The best way to visualize an electric field
135.33	is to think of gravity.
137.33	Gravity is also a field of forces
140.33	that act on masses.
142.33	We can all picture astronauts in space.
145.33	They float freely in three dimensions
147.33	without any forces acting on them.
149.33	But as that space shuttle
152.33	returns to Earth,
154.33	and as the astronauts enter the Earth's gravitational field,
157.33	they begin to see the effects of gravity.
160.33	They begin to be attracted towards Earth.
162.33	And as they land,
164.33	they're fully aligned in the gravitational field.
166.33	We're, of course, all stuck in the Earth's gravitational field right now.
169.33	That's why you're all in your chairs.
172.33	And that's why we have to use our muscle energy
174.33	to stand up, to walk around
176.33	and to lift things.
179.33	In cancer,
181.33	cells rapidly divide
183.33	and lead to uncontrolled tumor growth.
186.33	We can think of a cell
189.33	from an electrical perspective
191.33	as if it's a mini space station.
194.33	And in that space station
196.33	we have the genetic material, the chromosomes,
199.33	within a nucleus.
201.33	And out in the cytoplasmic soup
203.33	we have special proteins
205.33	that are required for cell division
207.33	that float freely in this soup
209.33	in three dimensions.
211.33	Importantly, those special proteins
214.33	are among the most highly charged objects
217.33	in our body.
219.33	As cell division begins
221.33	the nucleus disintegrates,
223.33	the chromosomes line up
225.33	in the middle of the cell
227.33	and those special proteins
229.33	undergo a three-dimensional sequence
233.33	whereby they attach
235.33	and they literally click into place end-on-end
238.33	to form chains.
240.33	These chains
242.33	then progress and attach
244.33	to the genetic material
247.33	and pull the genetic material
249.33	from one cell into two cells.
251.33	And this is exactly how
253.33	one cancer cell becomes two cancer cells,
255.33	two cancer cells become four cancer cells,
257.33	and we have ultimately
259.33	uncontrolled tumor growth.
262.33	Tumor Treating Fields
265.33	use externally placed transducers
269.33	attached to a field generator
272.33	to create an artificial electric field
276.33	on that space station.
279.33	And when that cellular space station
282.33	is within the electric field,
284.33	it acts on those highly charged proteins
288.33	and aligns them.
290.33	And it prevents them from forming those chains,
293.33	those mitotic spindles,
295.33	that are necessary to pull the genetic material
298.33	into the daughter cells.
300.33	What we see is that the cells will attempt to divide
303.33	for several hours.
305.33	And they will either enter into
308.33	this so-called cellular suicide,
310.33	programmed cell death,
312.33	or they will form unhealthy daughter cells
315.33	and enter into apoptosis
318.33	once they have divided.
320.33	And we can observe this.
322.33	What I'm going to show you next
324.33	are two in vitro experiments.
326.33	This is cultures, identical cultures,
329.33	of cervical cancer cells.
331.33	And we've stained these cultures
333.33	with a green florescent dye
335.33	so that we can look at these proteins
338.33	that form these chains.
340.33	The first clip shows
342.33	a normal cell division
345.33	without the Tumor Treating Fields.
348.33	What we see
350.33	are, first of all, a very active culture,
352.33	a lot of divisions,
354.33	and then very clear nuclei
356.33	once the cells have separated.
358.33	And we can see them dividing throughout.
360.33	When we apply the fields --
362.33	again, in the identical time-scale
364.33	to the identical culture --
366.33	you're going to see something different.
368.33	The cells round up for division,
370.33	but they're very static in that position.
373.33	We'll see two cells
375.33	in the upper part of the screen
380.33	attempting to divide.
382.33	The one within the circle manages.
384.33	But see how much of the protein
386.33	is still throughout the nucleus,
388.33	even in the dividing cell.
390.33	The one up there can't divide at all.
392.33	And then this bubbling, this membrane bubbling,
395.33	is the hallmark
397.33	of apoptosis in this cell.
400.33	Formation of healthy mitotic spindles
404.33	is necessary for division
407.33	in all cell types.
409.33	We've applied Tumor Treating Fields
411.33	to over 20 different cancers in the lab,
414.33	and we see this effect
416.33	in all of them.
419.33	Now importantly,
421.33	these Tumor Treating Fields have no effect
424.33	on normal undividing cells.
428.33	Dr. Palti founded a company called Novocure
431.33	to develop his discovery
434.33	into a practical therapy for patients.
437.33	In that time, Novocure's developed two systems --
441.33	one system for cancers in the head
444.33	and another system for cancers in the trunk of the body.
447.33	The first cancer that we have focused on
450.33	is the deadly brain cancer, GBM.
453.33	GBM affects about 10,000 people
456.33	in the U.S. each year.
459.33	It's a death sentence.
461.33	The expected five year survival
463.33	is less than five percent.
465.33	And the typical patient
467.33	with optimal therapy
469.33	survives just a little over a year,
472.33	and only about seven months
474.33	from the time that the cancer is first treated
477.33	and then comes back and starts growing again.
482.33	Novocure conducted
484.33	its first phase three randomized trial
486.33	in patients with recurrent GBM.
488.33	So these are patients
490.33	who had received surgery,
494.33	high dose radiation to the head
496.33	and first-line chemotherapy,
498.33	and that had failed and their tumors had grown back.
501.33	We divided the patients into two groups.
504.33	The first group received second-line chemotherapy,
507.33	which is expected to double the life expectancy,
510.33	versus no treatment at all.
512.33	And then the second group
514.33	received only Tumor Treating Field therapy.
517.33	What we saw in that trial
519.33	is that that the life expectancies of both groups --
522.33	so the chemotherapy treated group
524.33	and the Tumor Treating Field group --
526.33	was the same.
528.33	But importantly,
530.33	the Tumor Treating Field group
533.33	suffered none of the side effects
536.33	typical of chemotherapy patients.
539.33	They had no pain,
541.33	suffered none of the infections.
544.33	They had no nausea, diarrhea,
547.33	constipation, fatigue
550.33	that would be expected.
552.33	Based on this trial,
554.33	in April of this year,
556.33	the FDA approved Tumor Treating Fields
559.33	for the treatment of patients
561.33	with recurrent GBM.
564.33	Importantly, it was the first time ever
567.33	that the FDA included
569.33	in their approval of an oncology treatment
572.33	a quality of life claim.
576.33	So I'm going to show you now
579.33	one of the patients
581.33	from this trial.
584.33	Robert Dill-Bundi
586.33	is a famous Swiss cycling champion.
588.33	He won the gold medal in Moscow
590.33	in the 4,000 meter pursuit.
593.33	And five years ago,
596.33	Robert was diagnosed with GBM.
599.33	He received the standard treatments.
601.33	He received surgery.
604.33	He received high dose radiation to the head.
607.33	And he received first-line chemotherapy.
610.33	A year after this treatment --
612.33	in fact, this is his baseline MRI.
615.33	You can see that the black regions
618.33	in the upper right quadrant
620.33	are the areas where he had surgery.
622.33	And a year after that treatment,
624.33	his tumor grew back with a vengeance.
627.33	That cloudy white mass that you see
630.33	is the recurrence of the tumor.
633.33	At this point, he was told by his doctors
636.33	that he had about 3 months to live.
639.33	He entered our trial.
641.33	And here we can see him getting the therapy.
644.33	First of all, these electrodes are noninvasive.
647.33	They're attached to the skin
649.33	in the area of the tumor.
651.33	Here you can see
653.33	that a technician is placing them on there much like bandages.
656.33	The patients learn to do this themselves
659.33	And then the patients
662.33	can undergo all the activities of their daily life.
665.33	There's none of the tiredness.
667.33	"There's none of what is called the ""chemo head."""
670.33	There's no sensation.
672.33	It doesn't interfere
674.33	with computers or electrical equipment.
677.33	And the therapy is delivered continuously
679.33	at home,
681.33	without having to go into the hospital
683.33	either periodically or continually.
686.33	These are Robert's MRIs,
689.33	again, under only TTField treatment.
692.33	This is a therapy that takes time to work.
695.33	It's a medical device;
697.33	it works when it's on.
699.33	But what we can see is, by month six,
701.33	the tumor has responded
704.33	and it's begun to melt away.
707.33	It's still there.
709.33	By month 12,
711.33	we could argue whether
713.33	there's a little bit of material around the edges,
715.33	but it's essentially completely gone.
718.33	It's now five years
720.33	since Robert's diagnosis,
722.33	and he's alive,
725.33	but importantly, he's healthy
727.33	and he's at work.
729.33	I'm going to let him, in this very short clip,
731.33	describe his impressions of the therapy
733.33	in his own words.
735.33	(Video) Robert Dill-Bundi: My quality of life,
737.33	I rate what I have today
739.33	a bit different than what most people would assume.
743.33	I am the happiest, the happiest person in the world.
748.33	And every single morning I appreciate life.
752.33	Every night I fall asleep very well,
755.33	and I am, I repeat,
758.33	the happiest man in the world,
760.33	and I'm thankful I am alive.
765.33	BD: Novocure's also working on lung cancer
768.33	as the second target.
770.33	We've run a phase two trial
772.33	in Switzerland
774.33	on, again, recurrent patients --
776.33	patients who have received standard therapy
779.33	and whose cancer has come back.
782.33	I'm going to show you another clip
784.33	of a woman named Lydia.
786.33	Lydia's a 66 year-old farmer
788.33	in Switzerland.
790.33	She was diagnosed with lung cancer
792.33	five years ago.
794.33	She underwent four different regimes of chemotherapy
797.33	over two years,
799.33	none of which had an effect.
801.33	Her cancer continued to grow.
803.33	Three years ago,
805.33	she entered the Novocure lung cancer trial.
809.33	You can see, in her case,
811.33	she's wearing her transducer arrays,
813.33	one of the front of her chest, one on the back,
816.33	and then the second pair side-to-side over the liver.
819.33	You can see the Tumor Treating Field field generator,
822.33	but importantly you can also see that she is living her life.
825.33	She is managing her farm.
827.33	She's interacting with her kids and her grand kids.
830.33	And when we talked to her,
833.33	she said that when she was undergoing chemotherapy,
835.33	she had to go to the hospital every month for her infusions.
838.33	Her whole family suffered
840.33	as her side effect profile came and went.
842.33	Now she can run
844.33	all of the activities of her farm.
847.33	It's only the beginning.
849.33	(Applause)
856.33	In the lab, we've observed tremendous synergies
860.33	between chemotherapy and Tumor Treating Fields.
863.33	There's research underway now at Harvard Medical School
866.33	to pick the optimum pairs
868.33	to maximize that benefit.
870.33	We also believe that Tumor Treating Fields will work with radiation
873.33	and interrupt the self-repair mechanisms that we have.
877.33	There's now a new research project underway
879.33	at the Karolinska in Sweden
881.33	to prove that hypothesis.
883.33	We have more trials planned
885.33	for lung cancer,
887.33	pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer
889.33	and breast cancer.
891.33	And I firmly believe
893.33	that in the next 10 years
895.33	Tumor Treating Fields
897.33	will be a weapon available to doctors and patients
900.33	for all of these most-difficult-to-treat solid tumors.
906.33	I'm also very hopeful
908.33	that in the next decades,
910.33	we will make big strides
912.33	on reducing that death rate
915.33	that has been so challenging in this disease.
918.33	Thank you.
920.33	(Applause)
