12.78	A few days after my husband Paul
12.78	was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer,
19.18	we were lying in our bed at home,
21.7	and Paul said,
23.5	"""It's going to be OK."""
25.86	And I remember answering back,
28.38	"""Yes."
29.62	"We just don't know what OK means yet."""
35.14	Paul and I had met as first-year
35.14	medical students at Yale.
38.66	He was smart and kind and super funny.
42.7	He used to keep a gorilla suit
42.7	in the trunk of his car,
46.54	"and he'd say, ""It's for emergencies only."""
48.98	(Laughter)
51.02	I fell in love with Paul as I watched
51.02	the care he took with his patients.
55.22	He stayed late talking with them,
57.42	seeking to understand
57.42	the experience of illness
60.9	and not just its technicalities.
64.38	He later told me he fell in love with me
66.62	when he saw me cry over an EKG
66.62	of a heart that had ceased beating.
72.94	We didn't know it yet,
74.5	but even in the heady days of young love,
77.66	we were learning how
77.66	to approach suffering together.
82.66	We got married and became doctors.
85.06	I was working as an internist
87.1	and Paul was finishing his training
87.1	as a neurosurgeon
91.18	when he started to lose weight.
94.3	He developed excruciating back pain
94.3	and a cough that wouldn't go away.
100.22	And when he was admitted to the hospital,
102.38	a CT scan revealed tumors
102.38	in Paul's lungs and in his bones.
108.46	We had both cared for patients
108.46	with devastating diagnoses;
113.02	now it was our turn.
118.54	We lived with Paul's illness
118.54	for 22 months.
121.74	He wrote a memoir about facing mortality.
125.14	I gave birth to our daughter Cady,
128.06	and we loved her and each other.
130.54	We learned directly how to struggle
130.54	through really tough medical decisions.
137.14	The day we took Paul
137.14	into the hospital for the last time
140.739	was the most difficult day of my life.
144.38	When he turned to me at the end
146.38	"and said, ""I'm ready,"""
150.82	I knew that wasn't just a brave decision.
154.1	It was the right one.
156.5	Paul didn't want a ventilator and CPR.
160.18	In that moment,
161.7	the most important thing to Paul
165.38	was to hold our baby daughter.
169.06	Nine hours later,
170.9	Paul died.
175.78	I've always thought of myself
175.78	as a caregiver --
178.06	most physicians do --
180.14	and taking care of Paul
180.14	deepened what that meant.
183.94	Watching him reshape
183.94	his identity during his illness,
187.58	learning to witness and accept his pain,
191.1	talking together through his choices --
193.66	those experiences taught me
195.1	that resilience does not mean
195.1	bouncing back to where you were before,
200.38	or pretending that
200.38	the hard stuff isn't hard.
203.94	It is so hard.
206.98	It's painful, messy stuff.
211.14	But it's the stuff.
212.58	And I learned that when we
212.58	approach it together,
216.94	we get to decide what success looks like.
222.9	One of the first things
222.9	Paul said to me after his diagnosis was,
227.18	"""I want you to get remarried."""
230.3	And I was like, whoa, I guess
230.3	we get to say anything out loud.
233.66	(Laughter)
236.22	It was so shocking
238.3	and heartbreaking ...
241.26	and generous,
242.5	and really comforting
244.02	because it was so starkly honest,
246.62	and that honesty turned out
246.62	to be exactly what we needed.
250.58	Early in Paul's illness,
252.3	we agreed we would
252.3	just keep saying things out loud.
257.22	Tasks like making a will,
259.54	or completing our advance directives --
262.22	tasks that I had always avoided --
264.82	were not as daunting as they once seemed.
267.86	I realized that completing
267.86	an advance directive is an act of love --
273.3	like a wedding vow.
275.54	A pact to take care of someone,
277.82	codifying the promise
280.14	that til death do us part,
283.06	I will be there.
285.78	If needed, I will speak for you.
289.02	I will honor your wishes.
293.1	That paperwork became
293.1	a tangible part of our love story.
298.86	As physicians,
300.1	Paul and I were in a good position
301.78	to understand and even
301.78	accept his diagnosis.
305.94	We weren't angry about it,
307.3	luckily,
308.54	because we'd seen so many patients
308.54	in devastating situations,
312.7	and we knew that death is a part of life.
317.7	But it's one thing to know that;
319.3	it was a very different experience
320.98	to actually live with the sadness
320.98	and uncertainty of a serious illness.
326.54	Huge strides are being made
326.54	against lung cancer,
329.78	but we knew that Paul likely had
329.78	months to a few years left to live.
336.54	During that time,
337.78	Paul wrote about his transition
337.78	from doctor to patient.
341.5	He talked about feeling
341.5	like he was suddenly at a crossroads,
345.58	and how he would have thought
345.58	he'd be able to see the path,
349.14	that because he treated so many patients,
351.9	maybe he could follow in their footsteps.
355.1	But he was totally disoriented.
358.26	Rather than a path,
360.06	Paul wrote,
361.58	"""I saw instead"
363.66	only a harsh, vacant,
363.66	gleaming white desert.
368.54	As if a sandstorm
368.54	had erased all familiarity.
372.98	I had to face my mortality
375.82	and try to understand
375.82	what made my life worth living,
380.5	and I needed my oncologist's
380.5	"help to do so."""
387.26	The clinicians taking care of Paul
389.34	gave me an even deeper appreciation
389.34	for my colleagues in health care.
393.58	We have a tough job.
395.58	We're responsible for helping patients
395.58	have clarity around their prognoses
400.38	and their treatment options,
402.38	and that's never easy,
402.38	but it's especially tough
404.9	when you're dealing with potentially
404.9	terminal illnesses like cancer.
410.14	Some people don't want to know
410.14	how long they have left,
413.86	others do.
415.66	Either way, we never have those answers.
420.02	Sometimes we substitute hope
423.9	by emphasizing the best-case scenario.
428.14	In a survey of physicians,
	they painted a rosier picture
435.1	than their honest opinion
436.58	when describing a patient's prognosis.
439.78	It's an instinct born out of kindness.
443.94	But researchers have found
445.38	that when people better understand
445.38	the possible outcomes of an illness,
450.62	they have less anxiety,
452.9	greater ability to plan
455.66	and less trauma for their families.
460.62	Families can struggle
460.62	with those conversations,
463.38	but for us, we also found that information
463.38	immensely helpful with big decisions.
470.74	Most notably,
472.86	whether to have a baby.
476.62	Months to a few years meant
476.62	Paul was not likely to see her grow up.
482.66	But he had a good chance
482.66	of being there for her birth
485.18	and for the beginning of her life.
488.46	I remember asking Paul
490.46	if he thought having
490.46	to say goodbye to a child
493.86	would make dying even more painful.
498.22	And his answer astounded me.
500.1	He said,
501.82	"""Wouldn't it be great if it did?"""
507.86	And we did it.
509.66	Not in order to spite cancer,
513.34	but because we were learning
515.22	that living fully
515.22	means accepting suffering.
523.7	Paul's oncologist tailored his chemo
526.14	so he could continue
526.14	working as a neurosurgeon,
529.46	which initially we thought
529.46	was totally impossible.
533.34	When the cancer advanced
534.66	and Paul shifted from surgery to writing,
538.02	his palliative care doctor
538.02	prescribed a stimulant medication
541.38	so he could be more focused.
544.42	They asked Paul about
544.42	his priorities and his worries.
548.9	They asked him what trade-offs
548.9	he was willing to make.
554.3	Those conversations
554.3	are the best way to ensure
558.46	that your health care matches your values.
564.1	Paul joked that it's not
564.1	"like that ""birds and bees"" talk"
566.78	you have with your parents,
568.14	where you all get it over with
568.14	as quickly as possible,
570.7	and then pretend it never happened.
572.42	You revisit the conversation
572.42	as things change.
575.34	You keep saying things out loud.
580.22	I'm forever grateful
581.5	because Paul's clinicians felt
583.9	that their job wasn't to try
583.9	to give us answers they didn't have,
587.02	or only to try to fix things for us,
590.42	but to counsel Paul
590.42	through painful choices ...
594.14	when his body was failing
594.14	but his will to live wasn't.
601.26	Later, after Paul died,
603.78	I received a dozen bouquets of flowers,
606.5	but I sent just one ...
608.9	to Paul's oncologist,
610.98	because she supported his goals
614.46	and she helped him weigh his choices.
618.34	She knew that living
618.34	means more than just staying alive.
625.54	A few weeks ago,
625.54	a patient came into my clinic.
628.46	A woman dealing
628.46	with a serious chronic disease.
632.7	And while we were talking
632.7	about her life and her health care,
635.62	"she said, ""I love my palliative care team."
639.98	"They taught me that it's OK to say 'no'."""
643.46	Yeah, I thought, of course it is.
646.66	But many patients don't feel that.
650.66	Compassion and Choices did a study
652.82	where they asked people
652.82	about their health care preferences.
656.58	And a lot of people
656.58	started their answers with the words
660.66	"""Well, if I had a choice ..."""
663.86	If I had a choice.
666.7	"And when I read that ""if,"""
668.62	I understood better
670.82	why one in four people
673.7	receives excessive or unwanted
673.7	medical treatment,
678.58	or watches a family member receive
678.58	excessive or unwanted medical treatment.
685.42	It's not because doctors don't get it.
687.54	We do.
689.34	We understand the real
689.34	psychological consequences
692.3	on patients and their families.
695.58	The things is, we deal with them, too.
698.54	Half of critical care nurses
698.54	and a quarter of ICU doctors
703.9	have considered quitting their jobs
706.46	because of distress over feeling
706.46	that for some of their patients,
711.38	they've provided care
711.38	that didn't fit with the person's values.
717.22	But doctors can't make sure
717.22	your wishes are respected
719.74	until they know what they are.
723.82	Would you want to be on life support
723.82	if it offered any chance of longer life?
728.82	Are you most worried
728.82	about the quality of that time,
732.46	rather than quantity?
734.54	Both of those choices
734.54	are thoughtful and brave,
739.02	but for all of us, it's our choice.
742.02	That's true at the end of life
744.74	and for medical care throughout our lives.
747.34	If you're pregnant,
747.34	do you want genetic screening?
750.22	Is a knee replacement right or not?
753.42	Do you want to do dialysis
753.42	in a clinic or at home?
758.42	The answer is:
760.46	it depends.
762.38	What medical care will help you
762.38	live the way you want to?
768.9	I hope you remember that question
771.14	the next time you face
771.14	a decision in your health care.
775.02	Remember that you always have a choice,
779.06	and it is OK to say no to a treatment
779.06	that's not right for you.
786.42	There's a poem by W.S. Merwin --
789.82	it's just two sentences long --
792.14	that captures how I feel now.
796.82	"""Your absence has gone through me"
799.94	like thread through a needle.
803.62	Everything I do
803.62	"is stitched with its color."""
809.3	For me that poem evokes my love for Paul,
813.34	and a new fortitude
815.34	that came from loving and losing him.
820.18	"When Paul said, ""It's going to be OK,"""
823.82	that didn't mean
823.82	that we could cure his illness.
828.42	Instead, we learned to accept
828.42	both joy and sadness at the same time;
835.06	to uncover beauty and purpose
838.38	both despite and because we are all born
843.34	and we all die.
846.34	And for all the sadness
846.34	and sleepless nights,
849.7	it turns out there is joy.
852.26	I leave flowers on Paul's grave
854.9	and watch our two-year-old
854.9	run around on the grass.
859.06	I build bonfires on the beach
859.06	and watch the sunset with our friends.
865.34	Exercise and mindfulness
865.34	meditation have helped a lot.
870.62	And someday,
871.94	I hope I do get remarried.
876.38	Most importantly,
876.38	I get to watch our daughter grow.
880.54	I've thought a lot
880.54	about what I'm going to say to her
884.46	when she's older.
888.22	"""Cady,"
890.58	engaging in the full
890.58	range of experience --
893.82	living and dying,
895.54	love and loss --
897.86	is what we get to do.
900.9	Being human doesn't happen
900.9	despite suffering.
907.5	It happens within it.
910.78	When we approach suffering together,
913.42	when we choose not to hide from it,
916.9	our lives don't diminish,
918.34	"they expand."""
921.7	I've learned that cancer
921.7	isn't always a battle.
926.22	Or if it is,
927.9	maybe it's a fight for something
927.9	different than we thought.
932.46	Our job isn't to fight fate,
935.98	but to help each other through.
939.1	Not as soldiers
941.82	but as shepherds.
945.74	That's how we make it OK,
947.82	even when it's not.
950.9	By saying it out loud,
953.22	by helping each other through ...
957.18	and a gorilla suit never hurts, either.
960.1	Thank you.
961.34	(Applause)
