26	I live and work from Tokyo, Japan.
29	And I specialize in human behavioral research,
33	and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways,
39	and to design for that future.
41	And you know, to be honest, I've been doing this for seven years,
45	and I haven't got a clue what the future is going to be like.
47	But I've got a pretty good idea
49	how people will behave when they get there.
53	This is my office. It's out there.
56	It's not in the lab,
58	and it's increasingly in places like India, China, Brazil, Africa.
67	We live on a planet -- 6.3 billion people.
70	About three billion people, by the end of this year,
72	will have cellular connectivity.
75	And it'll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that.
80	And I mention this because,
82	if we want to design for that future,
84	we need to figure out what those people are about.
86	And that's, kind of, where I see what my job is
88	and what our team's job is.
91	Our research often starts with a very simple question.
94	So I'll give you an example. What do you carry?
98	If you think of everything in your life that you own,
103	when you walk out that door,
105	what do you consider to take with you?
107	When you're looking around, what do you consider?
110	Of that stuff, what do you carry?
113	And of that stuff, what do you actually use?
116	So this is interesting to us,
118	because the conscious and subconscious decision process
122	implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using
125	has some kind of spiritual, emotional or functional value.
128	And to put it really bluntly, you know,
131	people are willing to pay for stuff that has value, right?
135	So I've probably done about five years' research
138	looking at what people carry.
140	I go in people's bags. I look in people's pockets, purses.
144	I go in their homes. And we do this worldwide,
148	and we follow them around town with video cameras.
151	It's kind of like stalking with permission.
153	And we do all this -- and to go back to the original question,
157	what do people carry?
160	And it turns out that people carry a lot of stuff.
162	OK, that's fair enough.
164	But if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are --
169	across cultures and across gender and across contexts --
173	most people will say keys, money
176	and, if they own one, a mobile phone.
179	And I'm not saying this is a good thing, but this is a thing, right?
182	I mean, I couldn't take your phones off you if I wanted to.
184	You'd probably kick me out, or something.
189	OK, it might seem like an obvious thing
192	for someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask.
194	But really, the question is, why? Right?
196	So why are these things so important in our lives?
199	And it turns out, from our research, that it boils down to survival --
203	survival for us and survival for our loved ones.
207	So, keys provide an access to shelter and warmth --
212	transport as well, in the U.S. increasingly.
215	Money is useful for buying food, sustenance,
219	among all its other uses.
220	And a mobile phone, it turns out, is a great recovery tool.
226	If you prefer this kind of Maslow's hierarchy of needs,
229	those three objects are very good at supporting
232	the lowest rungs in Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
235	Yes, they do a whole bunch of other stuff,
237	but they're very good at this.
239	And in particular, it's the mobile phone's ability
243	to allow people to transcend space and time.
246	And what I mean by that is, you know,
248	you can transcend space by simply making a voice call, right?
253	And you can transcend time by sending a message at your convenience,
256	and someone else can pick it up at their convenience.
259	And this is fairly universally appreciated, it turns out,
263	which is why we have three billion plus people who have been connected.
266	And they value that connectivity.
268	But actually, you can do this kind of stuff with PCs.
270	And you can do them with phone kiosks.
273	And the mobile phone, in addition, is both personal --
277	and so it also gives you a degree of privacy -- and it's convenient.
280	You don't need to ask permission from anyone,
282	you can just go ahead and do it, right?
286	However, for these things to help us survive,
290	it depends on them being carried.
292	But -- and it's a pretty big but -- we forget.
296	We're human, that's what we do. It's one of our features.
299	I think, quite a nice feature.
301	So we forget, but we're also adaptable,
306	and we adapt to situations around us pretty well.
309	And so we have these strategies to remember,
311	and one of them was mentioned yesterday.
313	And it's, quite simply, the point of reflection.
316	And that's that moment when you're walking out of a space,
319	and you turn around, and quite often you tap your pockets.
322	Even women who keep stuff in their bags tap their pockets.
324	And you turn around, and you look back into the space,
327	and some people talk aloud.
329	And pretty much everyone does it at some point.
331	OK, the next thing is -- most of you, if you have a stable home life,
336	and what I mean is that you don't travel all the time, and always in hotels,
339	but most people have what we call a center of gravity.
342	And a center of gravity is where you keep these objects.
346	And these things don't stay in the center of gravity,
348	but over time, they gravitate there.
350	It's where you expect to find stuff.
352	And in fact, when you're turning around,
353	and you're looking inside the house,
355	and you're looking for this stuff,
357	this is where you look first, right?
359	OK, so when we did this research,
363	we found the absolutely, 100 percent, guaranteed way
366	to never forget anything ever, ever again.
369	And that is, quite simply, to have nothing to remember.
374	(Laughter)
376	OK, now, that sounds like something you get on a Chinese fortune cookie, right?
379	But is, in fact, about the art of delegation.
383	And from a design perspective,
385	it's about understanding what you can delegate to technology
390	and what you can delegate to other people.
393	And it turns out, delegation -- if you want it to be --
395	can be the solution for pretty much everything,
399	apart from things like bodily functions, going to the toilet.
402	You can't ask someone to do that on your behalf.
404	And apart from things like entertainment,
407	you wouldn't pay for someone to go to the cinema for you and have fun on your behalf,
410	or, at least, not yet.
412	Maybe sometime in the future, we will.
415	So, let me give you an example of delegation in practice, right.
419	So this is -- probably the thing I'm most passionate about
422	is the research that we've been doing on illiteracy
424	and how people who are illiterate communicate.
426	So, the U.N. estimated -- this is 2004 figures --
430	that there are almost 800 million people who can't read and write, worldwide.
434	So, we've been conducting a lot of research.
438	And one of the things we were looking at is --
441	if you can't read and write,
443	if you want to communicate over distances,
445	you need to be able to identify the person
448	that you want to communicate with.
450	It could be a phone number, it could be an e-mail address,
452	it could be a postal address.
453	Simple question: if you can't read and write,
455	how do you manage your contact information?
457	And the fact is that millions of people do it.
460	Just from a design perspective, we didn't really understand how they did it,
464	and so that's just one small example
466	of the kind of research that we were doing.
469	And it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation.
472	So they delegate that part of the task process to other people,
476	the stuff that they can't do themselves.
479	Let me give you another example of delegation.
481	This one's a little bit more sophisticated,
483	and this is from a study that we did in Uganda
485	about how people who are sharing devices, use those devices.
489	Sente is a word in Uganda that means money.
492	It has a second meaning, which is to send money as airtime. OK?
497	And it works like this.
499	So let's say, June, you're in a village, rural village.
502	I'm in Kampala and I'm the wage earner.
506	I'm sending money back, and it works like this.
509	So, in your village, there's one person in the village with a phone,
512	and that's the phone kiosk operator.
513	And it's quite likely that they'd have a quite simple mobile phone as a phone kiosk.
517	So what I do is, I buy a prepaid card like this.
522	And instead of using that money to top up my own phone,
525	I call up the local village operator.
527	And I read out that number to them, and they use it to top up their phone.
531	So, they're topping up the value from Kampala,
533	and it's now being topped up in the village.
536	You take a 10 or 20 percent commission, and then you --
539	the kiosk operator takes 10 or 20 percent commission,
542	and passes the rest over to you in cash.
546	OK, there's two things I like about this.
548	So the first is, it turns anyone who has access to a mobile phone --
553	anyone who has a mobile phone --
555	essentially into an ATM machine.
557	It brings rudimentary banking services to places
560	where there's no banking infrastructure.
562	And even if they could have access to the banking infrastructure,
565	they wouldn't necessarily be considered viable customers,
568	because they're not wealthy enough to have bank accounts.
571	There's a second thing I like about this.
574	And that is that despite all the resources at my disposal,
578	and despite all our kind of apparent sophistication,
580	I know I could never have designed something as elegant
584	and as totally in tune with the local conditions as this. OK?
589	And, yes, there are things like Grameen Bank and micro-lending.
592	But the difference between this and that
594	is, there's no central authority trying to control this.
598	This is just street-up innovation.
603	So, it turns out the street is a never-ending source of
606	inspiration for us.
608	And OK, if you break one of these things here, you return it to the carrier.
612	They'll give you a new one.
613	They'll probably give you three new ones, right?
615	I mean, that's buy three, get one free. That kind of thing.
618	If you go on the streets of India and China, you see this kind of stuff.
622	And this is where they take the stuff that breaks,
624	and they fix it, and they put it back into circulation.
630	This is from a workbench in Jilin City, in China,
634	and you can see people taking down a phone
636	and putting it back together.
638	They reverse-engineer manuals.
641	This is a kind of hacker's manual,
644	and it's written in Chinese and English.
646	They also write them in Hindi.
648	You can subscribe to these.
651	There are training institutes where they're churning out people
654	for fixing these things as well.
657	But what I like about this is,
660	it boils down to someone on the street with a small, flat surface,
666	a screwdriver, a toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads --
670	because they often get dust on the contact heads -- and knowledge.
674	And it's all about the social network of the knowledge, floating around.
678	And I like this because it challenges the way that we design stuff,
682	and build stuff, and potentially distribute stuff.
684	It challenges the norms.
687	OK, for me the street just raises so many different questions.
693	Like, this is Viagra that I bought from a backstreet sex shop in China.
699	And China is a country where you get a lot of fakes.
702	And I know what you're asking -- did I test it?
704	I'm not going to answer that, OK.
706	But I look at something like this, and I consider the implications
710	of trust and confidence in the purchase process.
713	And we look at this and we think, well, how does that apply,
715	for example, for the design of -- the lessons from this --
718	apply to the design of online services, future services in these markets?
725	This is a pair of underpants from --
729	(Laughter) --
731	from Tibet.
733	And I look at something like this, and honestly, you know,
736	why would someone design underpants with a pocket, right?
739	And I look at something like this and it makes me question,
742	if we were to take all the functionality in things like this,
746	and redistribute them around the body
747	in some kind of personal area network,
749	how would we prioritize where to put stuff?
751	And yes, this is quite trivial, but actually the lessons from this can apply to that
755	kind of personal area networks.
758	And what you see here is a couple of phone numbers
761	written above the shack in rural Uganda.
764	This doesn't have house numbers. This has phone numbers.
769	So what does it mean when people's identity is mobile?
775	When those extra three billion people's identity is mobile, it isn't fixed?
780	Your notion of identity is out-of-date already, OK,
784	for those extra three billion people.
787	This is how it's shifting.
789	And then I go to this picture here, which is the one that I started with.
794	And this is from Delhi.
797	It's from a study we did into illiteracy,
800	and it's a guy in a teashop.
802	You can see the chai being poured in the background.
804	And he's a, you know, incredibly poor teashop worker,
808	on the lowest rungs in the society.
810	And he, somehow, has the appreciation
814	of the values of Livestrong.
816	And it's not necessarily the same values,
818	but some kind of values of Livestrong,
820	to actually go out and purchase them,
823	and actually display them.
825	For me, this kind of personifies this connected world,
827	where everything is intertwined, and the dots are --
831	it's all about the dots joining together.
834	"OK, the title of this presentation is ""Connections and Consequences,"""
838	and it's really a kind of summary of five years of trying to figure out
843	what it's going to be like when everyone on the planet
846	has the ability to transcend space and time
849	in a personal and convenient manner, right?
852	When everyone's connected.
854	And there are four things.
858	So, the first thing is the immediacy of ideas,
860	the speed at which ideas go around.
863	And I know TED is about big ideas,
865	but actually, the benchmark for a big idea is changing.
870	If you want a big idea, you need to embrace everyone on the planet,
874	that's the first thing.
876	The second thing is the immediacy of objects.
879	And what I mean by that is, as these become smaller,
883	as the functionality that you can access through this becomes greater --
887	things like banking, identity --
889	these things quite simply move very quickly around the world.
894	And so the speed of the adoption of things
896	is just going to become that much more rapid,
898	in a way that we just totally cannot conceive,
901	when you get it to 6.3 billion
903	and the growth in the world's population.
906	The next thing is that, however we design this stuff --
910	carefully design this stuff --
911	the street will take it, and will figure out ways to innovate,
914	as long as it meets base needs --
917	the ability to transcend space and time, for example.
920	And it will innovate in ways that we cannot anticipate.
925	In ways that, despite our resources, they can do it better than us.
928	That's my feeling.
930	And if we're smart, we'll look at this stuff that's going on,
934	and we'll figure out a way to enable it to inform and infuse
939	both what we design and how we design.
942	And the last thing is that -- actually, the direction of the conversation.
949	With another three billion people connected,
954	they want to be part of the conversation.
956	And I think our relevance and TED's relevance
961	is really about embracing that and learning how to listen, essentially.
967	And we need to learn how to listen.
968	So thank you very, very much.
970	(Applause)
