16.014	I'm here today to show
16.014	my photographs of the Lakota.
19.664	Many of you may have heard of the Lakota,
21.839	or at least the larger group of tribes,
23.803	called the Sioux.
25.928	The Lakota are one of many tribes
25.928	that were moved off their land
29.087	to prisoner-of-war camps,
30.516	now called reservations.
32.757	The Pine Ridge Reservation,
34.868	the subject of today's slide show,
37.024	is located about 75 miles southeast
37.024	of the Black Hills in South Dakota.
41.35	It is sometimes referred to
41.35	as Prisoner of War Camp Number 334,
46.301	and it is where the Lakota now live.
48.451	Now, if any of you have ever heard of AIM,
50.661	the American Indian Movement,
52.605	or of Russell Means,
54.471	or Leonard Peltier,
56.883	or of the standoff at Oglala,
58.994	then you know Pine Ridge is ground zero
58.994	for Native issues in the US.
64.517	So I've been asked to talk
64.517	a little bit today
66.699	about my relationship with the Lakota,
68.891	and that's a very difficult one for me,
70.891	because, if you haven't
70.891	noticed from my skin color,
73.373	I'm white,
74.786	and that is a huge barrier
74.786	on a Native reservation.
79.373	You'll see a lot of people
79.373	in my photographs today.
81.827	I've become very close with them,
81.827	and they've welcomed me like family.
85.168	"They've called me ""brother"" and ""uncle,"""
87.11	and invited me again and again
87.11	over five years.
89.438	But on Pine Ridge,
90.66	"I will always be what is called ""wasichu."""
93.66	"""Wasichu"" is a Lakota word"
96.85	"that means ""non-Indian,"""
98.975	but another version of this word
101.078	"means ""the one who takes"
101.078	"the best meat for himself."""
104.667	And that's what I want to focus on --
106.512	the one who takes
106.512	the best part of the meat.
109.113	"It means ""greedy."""
111.318	So take a look around
111.318	this auditorium today.
114.13	We are at a private school
114.13	in the American West,
117.214	sitting in red velvet chairs
119.66	with money in our pockets.
121.961	And if we look at our lives,
123.731	we have indeed taken
123.731	the best part of the meat.
127.596	So let's look today
127.596	at a set of photographs
130.66	of a people who lost
132.322	so that we could gain,
134.323	and know that when you see
134.323	these people's faces,
137.564	that these are not just
137.564	images of the Lakota;
140.192	they stand for all indigenous people.
145.62	On this piece of paper
147.299	is the history the way I learned it
147.299	from my Lakota friends and family.
152.883	The following is a time line
152.883	of treaties made, treaties broken
157.17	and massacres disguised as battles.
159.928	I'll begin in 1824.
162.161	What is known as
162.161	the Bureau of Indian Affairs
164.297	was created within the War Department,
166.151	setting an early tone of aggression
167.865	in our dealings with the Native Americans.
171.495	The first treaty of Fort Laramie was made,
173.684	clearly marking the boundaries
173.684	of the Lakota Nation.
177.017	According to the treaty,
177.017	those lands are a sovereign nation.
180.66	If the boundaries
180.66	of this treaty had held --
182.78	and there is a legal basis
182.78	that they should --
185.431	then this is what the US
185.431	would look like today.
191.015	Ten years later.
192.58	The Homestead Act,
192.58	signed by President Lincoln,
195.326	unleashed a flood of white settlers
195.326	into Native lands.
200.308	An uprising of Santee Sioux in Minnesota
202.83	ends with the hanging of 38 Sioux men,
205.762	the largest mass execution in US history.
209.295	The execution was ordered
209.295	by President Lincoln,
211.558	only two days after he signed
211.558	the Emancipation Proclamation.
	of the Transcontinental Railroad --
221.425	a new era.
223.023	We appropriated land for trails and trains
225.237	to shortcut through the heart
225.237	of the Lakota Nation.
227.66	The treaties were out the window.
229.5	In response, three tribes led
229.5	by the Lakota chief Red Cloud
232.991	attacked and defeated the US army,
234.721	many times over.
235.943	I want to repeat that part:
237.292	The Lakota defeat the US army.
	clearly guarantees
244.903	the sovereignty of the Great Sioux Nation
246.943	and the Lakotas' ownership
246.943	of the sacred Black Hills.
250.09	The government also promises
250.09	land and hunting rights
252.568	in the surrounding states.
253.916	We promise that the Powder River country
256.003	will henceforth be closed to all whites.
258.761	The treaty seemed to be a complete victory
260.843	for Red Cloud and the Sioux.
262.327	In fact, this is the only war
262.327	in American history
266.072	in which the government negotiated a peace
268.332	by conceding everything
268.332	demanded by the enemy.
	Railroad was completed.
277.779	It began carrying, among other things,
277.779	large numbers of hunters,
281.19	who began the wholesale
281.19	killing of buffalo,
283.56	eliminating a source of food,
283.56	clothing and shelter for the Sioux.
288.937	The Indian Appropriation Act
290.621	makes all Indians
290.621	wards of the federal government.
293.559	In addition, the military issued orders
295.734	forbidding western Indians
295.734	from leaving reservations.
299.414	All western Indians at that point in time
299.414	were now prisoners of war.
304.163	Also in 1871,
305.634	we ended the time of treaty-making.
307.635	The problem with treaties is they allow
307.635	tribes to exist as sovereign nations,
311.351	and we can't have that.
312.545	We had plans.
316.061	General George Custer announced
316.061	the discovery of gold in Lakota territory,
319.641	specifically the Black Hills.
321.35	The news of gold creates
321.35	a massive influx of white settlers
324.185	into Lakota Nation.
325.974	Custer recommends that Congress find a way
328.031	to end the treaties with the Lakota
328.031	as soon as possible.
334.365	over the violation
334.365	of the Fort Laramie Treaty.
339.582	On July 26th,
341.264	on its way to attack a Lakota village,
343.507	Custer's 7th Cavalry was crushed
345.595	at the battle of Little Big Horn.
349.845	The great Lakota warrior
349.845	and chief named Crazy Horse
352.913	surrendered at Fort Robinson.
355.103	He was later killed while in custody.
	to get around the Fort Laramie Treaties.
365.907	A new agreement was presented
365.907	to Sioux chiefs and their leading men,
369.224	under a campaign known
369.224	"as ""Sell or Starve"" --"
371.66	sign the paper, or no food for your tribe.
374.416	Only 10 percent of the adult
374.416	male population signed.
377.846	The Fort Laramie Treaty called
377.846	for at least three-quarters of the tribe
381.589	to sign away land.
383.514	That clause was obviously ignored.
389.071	Communal ownership
389.071	of reservation lands ends.
391.66	Reservations are cut up
391.66	into 160-acre sections,
394.775	and distributed to individual Indians
396.78	with the surplus disposed of.
398.66	Tribes lost millions of acres.
401.582	The American dream
401.582	of individual land ownership
403.853	turned out to be a very clever way
405.872	to divide the reservation
405.872	until nothing was left.
409.301	The move destroyed the reservations,
411.171	making it easier
411.171	to further subdivide and to sell
414.145	with every passing generation.
416.415	Most of the surplus land
418.154	and many of the plots
418.154	within reservation boundaries
420.814	are now in the hands of white ranchers.
423.294	Once again, the fat of the land
423.294	goes to wasichu.
	the most important in this slide show.
432.428	This is the year
432.428	of the Wounded Knee Massacre.
435.497	On December 29,
436.942	US troops surrounded a Sioux
436.942	encampment at Wounded Knee Creek,
440.148	and massacred Chief Big Foot
440.148	and 300 prisoners of war,
444.221	using a new rapid-fire weapon
444.221	that fired exploding shells,
447.747	called a Hotchkiss gun.
449.81	"For this so-called ""battle,"""
454.441	were given to the 7th Cavalry.
457.66	To this day,
460.265	this is the most Medals of Honor
460.265	ever awarded for a single battle.
465.279	More Medals of Honor were given
466.923	for the indiscriminate slaughter
466.923	of women and children
469.477	than for any battle in World War One,
472.373	World War Two,
473.738	Korea, Vietnam,
476.073	Iraq or Afghanistan.
480.071	The Wounded Knee Massacre
480.071	is considered the end of the Indian wars.
485.102	Whenever I visit the site
485.102	of the mass grave at Wounded Knee,
488.586	I see it not just as a grave
488.586	for the Lakota or for the Sioux,
493.012	but as a grave for all indigenous peoples.
498.49	The holy man Black Elk, said,
501.054	"""I did not know then how much was ended."
504.997	When I look back now
504.997	from this high hill of my old age,
508.438	I can still see
508.438	the butchered women and children
511.043	lying heaped and scattered
511.043	all along the crooked gulch,
519.011	as plain as when I saw them
520.97	with eyes still young.
526.262	And I can see that something else
526.262	died there in the bloody mud
531.235	and was buried in the blizzard.
534.643	A people's dream died there.
537.783	"And it was a beautiful dream."""
542.338	With this event,
543.818	a new era in Native American
543.818	history began.
547.66	Everything can be measured
547.66	before Wounded Knee and after,
552.66	because it was in this moment,
554.451	with the fingers on the triggers
554.451	of the Hotchkiss guns,
557.762	that the US government openly
557.762	declared its position on Native rights.
562.119	They were tired of treaties.
564.055	They were tired of sacred hills.
566.047	They were tired of ghost dances.
568.936	And they were tired of all
568.936	the inconveniences of the Sioux.
572.555	So they brought out their cannons.
575.973	"""You want to be an Indian now?"" they said,"
578.324	finger on the trigger.
587.808	the US Indian population
587.808	reached its low point --
591.302	less than 250,000,
593.858	compared to an estimated
593.858	eight million in 1492.
599.756	Fast-forward.
603.493	The longest-running
603.493	court case in US history,
606.216	the Sioux Nation versus the United States,
608.821	was ruled upon by the US Supreme Court.
612.533	The court determined that when the Sioux
612.533	were resettled onto reservations
616.08	and seven million acres
616.08	of their land were opened up
619.191	to prospectors and homesteaders,
621.265	the terms of the second
621.265	Fort Laramie Treaty
623.852	had been violated.
625.792	The court stated that the Black Hills
625.792	were illegally taken,
629.556	and that the initial
629.556	offering price, plus interest,
632.195	should be paid to the Sioux Nation.
634.56	As payment for the Black Hills,
636.136	the court awarded only 106 million dollars
636.136	to the Sioux Nation.
640.592	The Sioux refused the money
640.592	with the rallying cry,
643.66	"""The Black Hills are not for sale."""
648.589	Statistics about Native population today,
651.405	more than a century
651.405	after the massacre at Wounded Knee,
654.66	reveal the legacy of colonization,
657.269	forced migration
658.561	and treaty violations.
661.155	Unemployment on the Pine Ridge
661.155	Indian Reservation
663.609	fluctuates between 85 and 90 percent.
666.949	The housing office is unable
666.949	to build new structures,
669.822	and existing structures are falling apart.
672.29	Many are homeless,
673.483	and those with homes
673.483	are packed into rotting buildings
676.066	with up to five families.
677.858	Thirty-nine percent of homes on Pine Ridge
680.089	have no electricity.
681.784	At least 60 percent
681.784	of the homes on the reservation
684.477	are infested with black mold.
687	More than 90 percent of the population
687	lives below the federal poverty line.
692.074	The tuberculosis rate on Pine Ridge
694.258	is approximately eight times higher
694.258	than the US national average.
697.875	The infant mortality rate
697.875	is the highest on this continent,
701.129	and is about three times higher
701.129	than the US national average.
704.461	Cervical cancer is five times higher
706.88	than the US national average.
708.715	The school dropout rate
708.715	is up to 70 percent.
712.059	Teacher turnover is eight times higher
712.059	than the US national average.
716.66	Frequently, grandparents
716.66	are raising their grandchildren
720.053	because parents, due to alcoholism,
722.395	domestic violence and general apathy,
725.144	cannot raise them.
727.342	Fifty percent of the population
727.342	over the age of 40
730.437	suffers from diabetes.
732.894	The life expectancy for men
732.894	is between 46 and 48 years old --
739.525	roughly the same
739.525	as in Afghanistan and Somalia.
745.398	The last chapter
745.398	in any successful genocide
748.962	is the one in which the oppressor
750.963	can remove their hands and say,
753.527	"""My god -- what are these people"
753.527	doing to themselves?
757.013	They're killing each other.
758.733	They're killing themselves
760.66	"while we watch them die."""
763.501	This is how we came to own
763.501	these United States.
766.96	This is the legacy
768.279	of Manifest Destiny.
770.713	Prisoners are still born
770.713	into prisoner of war camps,
774.964	long after the guards are gone.
779.709	These are the bones
779.709	left after the best meat has been taken.
787.151	A long time ago,
788.493	a series of events was set in motion
790.494	by a people who look like me, by wasichu,
794.02	eager to take the land and the water
794.02	and the gold in the hills.
798.462	Those events led to a domino effect
798.462	that has yet to end.
802.588	As removed as we,
802.588	the dominant society, may feel
807.414	from a massacre in 1890,
810.031	or a series of broken
810.031	treaties 150 years ago,
814.231	I still have to ask you the question:
817.344	How should you feel
817.344	about the statistics of today?
821.138	What is the connection
821.138	between these images of suffering
824.326	and the history that I just read to you?
827.19	And how much of this history
827.19	do you need to own, even?
830.739	Is any of this your responsibility today?
834.533	I have been told that there must be
834.533	something we can do.
837.25	There must be some call to action.
840.957	Because for so long,
840.957	I've been standing on the sidelines,
844.469	content to be a witness,
846.119	just taking photographs.
848.921	Because the solutions
848.921	seem so far in the past,
851.544	I needed nothing short
851.544	of a time machine to access them.
855.94	The suffering of indigenous peoples
855.94	is not a simple issue to fix.
861.9	It's not something everyone can get behind
863.94	the way they get behind helping Haiti,
865.813	or ending AIDS, or fighting a famine.
868.999	"The ""fix,"" as it's called,"
870.989	may be much more difficult
870.989	for the dominant society
873.66	than, say, a $50 check
875.981	or a church trip to paint
875.981	some graffiti-covered houses,
879.302	or a suburban family
880.937	donating a box of clothes
880.937	they don't even want anymore.
884.556	So where does that leave us?
886.436	Shrugging our shoulders in the dark?
890.27	The United States continues
890.27	on a daily basis to violate the terms
894.974	of the 1851 and 1868
894.974	Fort Laramie Treaties with the Lakota.
899.983	The call to action I offer today --
903.152	my TED wish -- is this:
906.611	Honor the treaties.
908.485	Give back the Black Hills.
910.579	It's not your business
910.579	what they do with them.
915.158	(Applause)
