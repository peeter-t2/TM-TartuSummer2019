15.64	So the type of magic I like,
15.64	and I'm a magician,
18.541	is magic that uses technology
18.541	to create illusions.
22.26	So I would like to show you
22.26	something I've been working on.
25.094	It's an application
26.365	that I think will be useful for artists --
26.365	multimedia artists in particular.
31.032	It synchronizes videos
31.032	across multiple screens of mobile devices.
35.421	I borrowed these three iPods
35.421	from people here in the audience
38.366	to show you what I mean.
43.036	And I'm going to use them to tell you
43.036	a little bit about my favorite subject:
47.728	deception.
51.991	(Music)
54.036	One of my favorite magicians
54.036	is Karl Germain.
58.779	He had this wonderful trick
58.779	where a rosebush would bloom
63.266	right in front of your eyes.
65.702	But it was his production of a butterfly
65.702	that was the most beautiful.
70.977	(Recording) Announcer:
70.977	Ladies and gentlemen,
73.858	the creation of life.
76.26	(Applause)
78.26	(Music)
81.975	Marco Tempest: When asked about deception,
84.217	he said this:
87.22	Announcer: Magic
87.22	is the only honest profession.
90.711	A magician promises to deceive you --
93.368	and he does.
94.778	MT: I like to think of myself
94.778	as an honest magician.
98.275	I use a lot of tricks,
99.986	which means that sometimes
99.986	I have to lie to you.
104.836	Now I feel bad about that.
107.899	But people lie every day.
110.4	(Ringing)
111.448	Hold on.
112.485	Phone: Hey, where are you?
114.164	MT: Stuck in traffic. I'll be there soon.
117.257	You've all done it.
118.748	(Laughter)
120.264	(Music)
121.312	Right: I'll be ready
121.312	in just a minute, darling.
123.685	Center: It's just what I've always wanted.
126.906	Left: You were great.
128.993	MT: Deception,
130.771	it's a fundamental part of life.
134.508	Now polls show
135.937	that men tell twice
135.937	as many lies as women --
140.26	assuming the women
140.26	they asked told the truth.
143.18	(Laughing)
144.339	We deceive to gain advantage
147.26	and to hide our weaknesses.
150.67	The Chinese general Sun Tzu said
150.67	that all war was based on deception.
157.106	Oscar Wilde said
157.106	the same thing of romance.
161.26	Some people deceive
163.997	for money.
165.544	Let's play a game.
168.552	Three cards, three chances.
171.87	Announcer: One five will get you 10,
174.568	Now, where's the lady?
176.444	Where is the queen?
179.158	MT: This one?
180.748	Sorry. You lose.
182.861	Well, I didn't deceive you.
185.414	You deceived yourself.
188.612	Self-deception.
190.565	That's when we convince ourselves
190.565	that a lie is the truth.
194.863	Sometimes it's hard to tell the two apart.
200.165	Compulsive gamblers
200.165	are experts at self-deception.
203.755	(Slot machine)
205.398	They believe they can win.
207.89	They forget the times they lose.
210.597	The brain is very good at forgetting.
213.87	Bad experiences are quickly forgotten.
217.076	Bad experiences quickly disappear.
221.265	Which is why in this vast
221.265	and lonely cosmos,
224.206	we are so wonderfully optimistic.
228.19	Our self-deception
228.19	becomes a positive illusion --
232.321	why movies are able to take us
232.321	onto extraordinary adventures;
237.074	why we believe Romeo
237.074	when he says he loves Juliet;
240.876	and why single notes of music,
243.608	when played together,
245.95	become a sonata and conjure up meaning.
249.37	"That's ""Clair De lune."""
250.812	Its composer, called Debussy,
253.453	said that art was
253.453	the greatest deception of all.
258.36	Art is a deception
258.36	that creates real emotions --
263.608	a lie that creates a truth.
267.227	And when you give yourself
267.227	over to that deception,
271.432	it becomes magic.
274.733	[MAGIC]
278.856	(Music fades slowly)
281.538	(Applause)
294.228	Thank you. Thank you very much.
297.204	(Applause)
