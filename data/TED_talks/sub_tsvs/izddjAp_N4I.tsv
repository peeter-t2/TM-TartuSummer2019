16.26	So there are a few things
18.26	that bring us humans together in the way that an election does.
21.26	We stand in elections; we vote in elections;
24.26	we observe elections.
26.26	Our democracies rely on elections.
29.26	We all understand why we have elections,
32.26	and we all leave the house on the same day
34.26	to go and vote.
36.26	We cherish the opportunity to have our say,
39.26	to help decide the future of the country.
44.26	The fundamental idea is that politicians
46.26	are given mandate to speak for us,
49.26	to make decisions on our behalf
51.26	that affect us all.
53.26	Without that mandate, they would be corrupt.
56.26	Well unfortunately, power corrupts,
58.26	and so people will do lots of things
61.26	to get power and to stay in power,
64.26	including doing bad things to elections.
68.26	You see, even if the idea
70.26	of the election is perfect,
72.26	running a countrywide election is a big project,
75.26	and big projects are messy.
78.26	Whenever there is an election,
80.26	it seems like something always goes wrong,
82.26	someone tries to cheat,
84.26	or something goes accidentally awry --
87.26	a ballot box goes missing here,
90.26	chads are left hanging over here.
93.26	To make sure as few things as possible go wrong,
97.26	we have all these procedures around the election.
100.26	So for example, you come to the polling station,
103.26	and a poll station worker asks for your ID
106.26	before giving you a ballot form
108.26	and asking you to go into a voting booth
110.26	to fill out your vote.
112.26	When you come back out, you get to drop your vote
114.26	into the ballot box
116.26	where it mixes with all the other votes,
118.26	so that no one knows how you voted.
121.26	Well, what I want us to think about for a moment
123.26	is what happens after that,
125.26	after you drop your vote into the ballot box.
127.26	And most people would go home
129.26	and feel sure that their vote has been counted,
131.26	because they trust
133.26	that the election system works.
135.26	They trust that election workers and election observers
138.26	do their jobs and do their jobs correctly.
142.26	The ballot boxes go to counting places.
145.26	They're unsealed and the votes are poured out
148.26	and laboriously counted.
151.26	Most of us have to trust
153.26	that that happens correctly for our own vote,
155.26	and we all have to trust that that happens correctly
158.26	for all the votes in the election.
161.26	So we have to trust a lot of people.
165.26	We have to trust a lot of procedures.
169.26	And sometimes we even have to trust computers.
174.26	So imagine hundreds of millions of voters
176.26	casting hundreds of millions of votes,
178.26	all to be counted correctly
181.26	and all the things that can possibly go wrong
184.26	causing all these bad headlines,
189.26	and you cannot help but feel exhausted at the idea
192.26	of trying to make elections better.
198.26	Well in the face of all these bad headlines,
200.26	researchers have taken a step back
203.26	and thought about how we can do elections differently.
207.26	They've zoomed out and looked at the big picture.
210.26	And the big picture is this:
212.26	elections should be verifiable.
216.26	Voters should be able to check
219.26	that their votes are counted correctly,
222.26	without breaking election secrecy,
224.26	which is so very important.
227.26	And that's the tough part.
229.26	How do we make an election system completely verifiable
232.26	while keeping the votes
234.26	absolutely secret?
236.26	Well, the way we've come up with
238.26	uses computers
240.26	but doesn't depend on them.
242.26	And the secret is the ballot form.
244.26	And if you look closely at these ballot forms,
246.26	you'll notice that the candidate list
248.26	is in a different order on each one.
250.26	And that means, if you mark your choices on one of them
253.26	and then remove the candidate list,
255.26	I won't be able to tell from the bit remaining
258.26	what your vote is for.
261.26	And on each ballot form there is this encrypted value
264.26	in the form of this 2D barcode
266.26	on the right.
268.26	And there's some complicated cryptography
270.26	going on in there,
272.26	but what's not complicated
274.26	is voting with one of these forms.
277.26	So we can let computers do all the complicated cryptography for us,
280.26	and then we'll use the paper for verification.
284.26	So this is how you vote.
286.26	You get one of these ballot forms at random,
290.26	and then you go into the voting booth,
292.26	and you mark your choices,
294.26	and you tear along a perforation.
299.26	And you shred the candidate list.
302.26	And the bit that remains, the one with your marks --
305.26	this is your encrypted vote.
307.26	So you let a poll station worker
309.26	scan your encrypted vote.
311.26	And because it's encrypted,
313.26	it can be submitted, stored
315.26	and counted centrally
318.26	and displayed on a website
320.26	for anyone to see, including you.
323.26	So you take this encrypted vote
326.26	home as your receipt.
328.26	And after the close of the election,
330.26	you can check that your vote was counted
332.26	by comparing your receipt
335.26	to the vote on the website.
339.26	And remember, the vote is encrypted
341.26	from the moment you leave the voting booth,
344.26	so if an election official wants to find out how you voted,
347.26	they will not be able to.
349.26	If the government wants to find out how you voted,
351.26	they won't be able to.
354.26	No hacker can break in
356.26	and find out how you voted.
358.26	No hacker can break in and change your vote,
361.26	because then it won't match your receipt.
364.26	Votes can't go missing
367.26	because then you won't find yours when you look for it.
371.26	But the election magic doesn't stop there.
374.26	Instead, we want to make the whole process
376.26	so transparent
378.26	that news media and international observers
381.26	and anyone who wants to
383.26	can download all the election data
385.26	and do the count themselves.
387.26	They can check that all the votes were counted correctly.
390.26	They can check
392.26	that the announced result of the election
394.26	is the correct one.
396.26	And these are elections
398.26	by the people, for the people.
400.26	So the next step for our democracies
403.26	are transparent
405.26	and verifiable elections.
407.26	Thank you.
409.26	(Applause)
