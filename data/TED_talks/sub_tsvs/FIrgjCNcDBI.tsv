13.36	When we think of Nepal,
15.292	we tend to think of the snow-capped mountains
17.747	of the Himalayas,
19.019	the crystal-clear still waters of its alpine lakes,
22.468	or the huge expanse of its grasslands.
25.514	What some of us may not realize
27.721	is that in the Himalayan foothills,
30.045	where the climate is much warmer
32.219	and the landscape much greener,
34.307	there lives a great diversity of wildlife,
36.733	including the one-horned rhinoceros,
39.469	the Asian elephant
41.143	and the Bengal tiger.
43.218	But unfortunately, these animals
45.07	are under constant threat from poachers
47.733	who hunt and kill them for their body parts.
51.045	To stop the killing of these animals,
53.254	battalions of soldiers and rangers
55.852	are sent to protect Nepal's national parks,
59.101	but that is not an easy task,
60.726	because these soldiers have to patrol
63.397	thousands of hectares of forests on foot
66.388	or elephant backs.
68.029	It is also risky for these soldiers
70.514	when they get into gunfights with poachers,
72.895	and therefore Nepal is always looking
74.911	for new ways to help with protecting the forests
78.207	and wildlife.
80.184	Well recently, Nepal acquired a new tool
82.693	in the fight against wildlife crime,
85.406	and these are drones,
87.112	or more specifically, conservation drones.
90.386	For about a year now, my colleagues and I
92.9	have been building drones for Nepal
95.16	and training the park protection personnel
97.658	on the use of these drones.
99.636	Not only does a drone give you
101.268	a bird's-eye view of the landscape,
103.742	but it also allows you to capture detailed,
106.777	high-resolution images of objects on the ground.
110.759	This, for example, is a pair of rhinoceros
114.268	taking a cooling bath on a hot summer day
117.205	in the lowlands of Nepal.
119.168	Now we believe that drones have
121.399	tremendous potential,
123.207	not only for combating wildlife crime,
125.985	but also for monitoring the health
127.948	of these wildlife populations.
130.487	So what is a drone?
132.337	Well, the kind of drone I'm talking about
134.846	is simply a model aircraft
136.947	fitted with an autopilot system,
139.392	and this autopilot unit contains a tiny computer,
143.661	a GPS, a compass, a barometric altimeter
147.715	and a few other sensors.
149.974	Now a drone like this
151.393	is meant to carry a useful payload,
153.599	such as a video camera
155.382	or a photographic camera.
157.37	It also requires a software that allows the user
160.719	to program a mission,
162.42	to tell the drone where to go.
164.826	Now people I talk to are often surprised
166.903	when they hear that these are the only
169.234	four components that make a conservation drone,
172.341	but they are even more surprised
173.845	when I tell them how affordable
173.845	these components are.
177.345	The facts is, a conservation drone
179.631	doesn't cost very much more than
181.89	a good laptop computer
183.867	or a decent pair of binoculars.
187.126	So now that you've built
187.126	your own conservation drone,
190.098	you probably want to go fly it,
192.26	but how does one fly a drone?
194.193	Well, actually, you don't,
195.785	because the drone flies itself.
198.275	All you have to do is to program a mission
201.405	to tell the drone where to fly.
203.665	But you simply do that by clicking on
205.984	a few way points on the Google Maps interface
209.233	using the open-source software.
211.483	Those missions could be as simple
213.43	as just a few way points,
215.456	or they could be slightly longer
215.456	and more complicated,
218.833	to fly along a river system.
221.254	Sometimes, we fly the drone
221.254	in a lawnmower-type pattern
225.103	and take pictures of that area,
227.223	and those pictures can be processed
229.194	to produce a map of that forest.
231.933	Other researchers might want to fly the drone
234.536	along the boundaries of a forest
236.678	to watch out for poachers or people
238.849	who might be trying to enter the forest illegally.
241.767	Now whatever your mission is,
243.647	once you've programmed it,
245.12	you simply upload it to the autopilot system,
248.103	bring your drone to the field,
249.743	and launch it simply by tossing it in the air.
252.958	And often we'll go about this mission
255.3	taking pictures or videos along the way,
258.36	and usually at that point,
260.294	we will go grab ourselves a cup of coffee,
262.511	sit back, and relax for the next few minutes,
265.441	although some of us sit back
265.441	and panic for the next few minutes
268.952	worrying that the drone will not return.
271.17	Usually it does, and when it does,
273.443	it even lands automatically.
276.849	So what can we do with a conservation drone?
279.756	Well, when we built our first prototype drone,
283.149	our main objective was to fly it over
285.667	a remote rainforest in North Sumatra, Indonesia,
289.556	to look for the nest of a species of great ape
292.605	known as the orangutan.
294.761	The reason we wanted to do that was because
297.417	we needed to know how many individuals
299.446	of this species are still left in that forest.
302.833	Now the traditional method of surveying
305.019	for orangutans is to walk the forest on foot
308.621	carrying heavy equipment
310.508	and to use a pair of binoculars
310.508	to look up in the treetops
314.158	where you might find an orangutan or its nest.
317.576	Now as you can imagine,
319.302	that is a very time-consuming, labor-intensive,
322.272	and costly process,
323.99	so we were hoping that drones
325.786	could significantly reduce the cost of surveying
329.111	for orangutan populations in Indonesia
331.678	and elsewhere in Southeast Asia.
334.145	So we were very excited when we captured
336.5	our first pair of orangutan nests on camera.
339.67	And this is it; this is the first ever picture
342.834	of orangutan nests taken with a drone.
345.874	Since then we have taken pictures
347.898	of dozens of these nests
349.516	from around various parts of Southeast Asia,
352.285	and we're now working with computer scientists
354.528	to develop algorithms that can automatically count
358.447	the number of nests from the thousands
360.464	of photos we've collected so far.
363.583	But nests are not the only objects
365.541	these drones can detect.
367.331	This is a wild orangutan
369.64	happily feeding on top of a palm tree,
372.161	seemingly oblivious to our drone
372.161	that was flying overhead,
375.713	not once but several times.
378.097	We've also taken pictures of other animals
381.115	including forest buffalos in Gabon,
384.236	elephants, and even turtle nests.
387.451	But besides taking pictures
387.451	of just the animals themselves,
390.991	we also take pictures of the habitats
390.991	these animals live in,
394.992	because we want to keep track
396.606	of the health of these habitats.
399.56	Sometimes, we zoom out a little
401.779	and look at other things that might be happening
404.032	in the landscape.
405.496	This is an oil palm plantation in Sumatra.
408.796	Now oil palm is a major driver of deforestation
412.038	in that part of the world,
413.56	so we wanted to use this new drone technology
416.617	to keep track of the spread of these plantations
419.732	in Southeast Asia.
421.742	But drones could also be used to keep track of
424.105	illegal logging activities.
426.589	This is a recently logged forest,
429.03	again in Sumatra.
430.385	You could even still see the processed
432.544	wooden planks left on the ground.
436.172	But perhaps the most exciting part
438.461	about taking pictures from the air is
441.027	we could later stitch these pictures together
443.453	using special software to create a map
446.316	of the entire landscape, and this map
449.083	gives us crucial information
451.098	for monitoring land use change,
453.366	to let us know where and when
453.366	plantations might be expanding,
457.113	where forests might be contracting,
459.39	or where fires might be breaking out.
462.772	Aerial images could also be processed
465.004	to produce three-dimensional
467.313	computer models of forests.
469.31	Now these models are not just visually appealing,
472.263	but they are also geometrically accurate,
474.764	which means researchers can now measure
477.541	the distance between trees,
479.666	calculate surface area, the volume of vegetation,
482.961	and so on, all of which are important information
486.16	for monitoring the health of these forests.
489.473	Recently, we've also begun experimenting
491.926	with thermal imaging cameras.
493.99	Now these cameras can detect
495.879	heat-emitting objects from the ground,
497.864	and therefore they are very useful
497.864	for detecting poachers or their campfires at night.
505.236	So I've told you quite a lot about
507.12	what conservation drones are,
509.336	how you might operate one of these drones,
511.653	and what a drone could do for you.
513.662	I will now tell you where conservation drones
515.898	are being used around the world.
518.353	We built our first prototype drones in Switzerland.
521.406	We brought a few of these to Indonesia
523.547	for the first few test flights.
525.69	Since then, we've been building drones
527.505	for our collaborators from around the world,
530.187	and these include fellow biologists
532.367	and partners from major conservation organizations.
536.295	Perhaps the best and most rewarding part
538.585	about working with these collaborators
540.711	is the feedback they give us
542.191	on how to improve our drones.
544.834	Building drones for us is
546.965	a constant work in progress.
549.129	We are constantly trying to improve them in terms of
552.206	their range, their ruggedness,
554.82	and the amount of payload they can carry.
557.498	We also work with collaborators
559.54	to discover new ways of using these drones.
562.827	For example, camera traps are a common tool
566.107	used by biologists to take pictures of shy animals
570.002	hiding in the forests,
571.563	but these are motion-activated cameras,
573.897	so they snap a picture every time an animal
576.538	crosses their path.
578.21	But the problem with camera traps
579.762	is that the researcher has to go back to the forest
583.505	every so often to retrieve those images,
586.958	and that takes a lot of time,
588.61	especially if there are dozens
590.444	or hundreds of these cameras placed in the forest.
593.572	Now a drone could be designed to perform the task
596.383	much more efficiently.
598.107	This drone, carrying a special sensor,
600.777	could be flown over the forest
603.118	and remotely download these images
605.865	from wi-fi–enabled cameras.
610.002	Radio collars are another tool
612.139	that's commonly used by biologists.
614.387	Now these collars are put onto animals.
617.054	They transmit a radio signal which allows
619.855	the researcher to track the movements
619.855	of these animals across the landscape.
625.002	But the traditional way of tracking animals
627.659	is pretty ridiculous,
629.881	because it requires the researcher to be walking
632.825	on the ground carrying a huge
632.825	and cumbersome radio antenna,
636.939	not unlike those old TV antennae we used to have
639.812	on our rooftops. Some of us still do.
642.78	A drone could be used to do the same job
645.045	much more efficiently.
646.704	Why not equip a drone
648.41	with a scanning radio receiver,
650.413	fly that over the forest canopy
652.407	in a certain pattern
653.945	which would allow the user or the operator
656.737	to triangulate the location
659.319	of these radio-collared animals remotely
662.306	without having to step foot in the forest.
665.279	A third and perhaps most exciting way
667.782	of using these drones
669.312	is to fly them to a really remote,
672.262	never-explored-before rainforest
674.538	somewhere hidden in the tropics,
676.362	and parachute down a tiny spy microphone
680.295	that would allow us to eavesdrop on the calls
682.741	of mammals, birds, amphibians,
686.063	the Yeti, the Sasquatch, Bigfoot, whatever.
690.34	That would give us biologists
692.079	a pretty good idea of what animals
693.965	might be living in those forests.
696.515	And finally, I would like to show you
698.564	the latest version of our conservation drone.
701.665	The MAJA drone has a wingspan
703.804	of about two meters.
705.478	It weighs only about two kilograms,
707.428	but it can carry half its weight.
709.889	It is a fully autonomous system.
712.484	During its mission, it can even transmit
714.871	a live video feed back to a ground station laptop,
718.834	which allows the user
720.377	to see what the drone is seeing in real time.
723.307	It carries a variety of sensors,
725.729	and the photo quality of some of these sensors
728.067	can be as high as one to two centimeters per pixel.
732.277	This drone can stay in the air for 40 to 60 minutes,
735.958	which gives it a range of up to 50 kilometers.
739.082	That is quite sufficient for most
740.997	of our conservation applications.
743.996	Now, conservation drones began as
746.066	a crazy idea from two biologists
748.257	who are just deeply passionate
748.257	about this technology.
751.542	And we believe, strongly believe,
753.692	that drones can and will be a game changer
757.039	for conservation research and applications.
760.073	We've had our fair share of skeptics and critics
763.248	who thought that we were just
763.248	fooling around with toy planes.
766.769	And in a way, they are right.
768.195	I mean, let's be honest,
769.824	drones are the ultimate toys for boys.
773.512	But at the same time, we've also gotten to know
775.918	many wonderful colleagues and collaborators
778.167	who share our vision
779.715	and see the potential of conservation drones.
782.571	To us, it is obvious that conservation biologists
786.17	and practitioners should make full use
788.428	of every available tool, including drones,
791.962	in our fight to save the last remaining forests
794.603	and wildlife of this planet.
796.39	Thank you.
798.388	(Applause)
