16.236	Khan Academy is most known
16.236	for its collection of videos,
19.26	so before I go any further,
21.26	let me show you a little bit of a montage.
24.623	(Video) Salman Khan: So the hypotenuse
24.623	is now going to be five.
27.719	This animal's fossils are only found
27.719	in this area of South America --
31.036	a nice clean band here --
32.64	and this part of Africa.
34.853	We can integrate over the surface,
37.043	and the notation
37.043	usually is a capital sigma.
39.908	National Assembly: They create
39.908	the Committee of Public Safety,
43.098	which sounds like a very nice committee.
45.083	Notice, this is an aldehyde,
45.083	and it's an alcohol.
48.812	Start differentiating
48.812	into effector and memory cells.
52.081	A galaxy. Hey! There's another galaxy.
52.081	Oh, look! There's another galaxy.
55.825	And for dollars, is their 30 million,
58.26	plus the 20 million dollars
58.26	from the American manufacturer.
61.323	If this does not blow your mind,
64.847	then you have no emotion.
66.878	(Laughter)
68.26	(Applause)
73.799	(Live) SK: We now have
73.799	on the order of 2,200 videos,
77.804	covering everything from basic arithmetic,
77.804	all the way to vector calculus,
82.019	and some of the stuff
82.019	that you saw up there.
84.26	We have a million students
84.26	a month using the site,
87.688	watching on the order
87.688	of 100 to 200,000 videos a day.
91.26	But what we're going to talk about in this
91.26	is how we're going to the next level.
95.934	But before I do that,
97.26	I want to talk a little bit
97.26	about really just how I got started.
101.18	And some of you all might know,
103.505	about five years ago,
103.505	I was an analyst at a hedge fund,
106.55	and I was in Boston,
109.042	and I was tutoring my cousins
109.042	in New Orleans, remotely.
112.154	And I started putting
112.154	the first YouTube videos up,
114.519	really just as a kind of nice-to-have,
116.377	just kind of a supplement for my cousins,
118.526	something that might give them
118.526	a refresher or something.
121.558	And as soon as I put those
121.558	first YouTube videos up,
124.222	something interesting happened.
125.75	Actually, a bunch of interesting
125.75	things happened.
128.118	The first was the feedback
128.118	from my cousins.
130.967	They told me that they preferred
130.967	me on YouTube than in person.
135.732	(Laughter)
142.733	And once you get over
142.733	the backhanded nature of that,
147.047	there was actually something
147.047	very profound there.
149.379	They were saying that they preferred
149.379	the automated version of their cousin
153.229	to their cousin.
154.84	At first it's very unintuitive,
156.353	but when you think about it from their
156.353	point of view, it makes a ton of sense.
160.135	You have this situation where now
160.135	they can pause and repeat their cousin,
163.979	without feeling
163.979	like they're wasting my time.
167.027	If they have to review something
169.423	that they should have learned
169.423	a couple of weeks ago,
172.002	or maybe a couple of years ago,
174.248	they don't have to be embarrassed
174.248	and ask their cousin.
176.93	They can just watch those videos;
176.93	if they're bored, they can go ahead.
180.296	They can watch at their own time and pace.
182.344	Probably the least-appreciated aspect
182.344	of this
187.169	is the notion that the very first time
189.764	that you're trying to get
189.764	your brain around a new concept,
193.636	the very last thing you need
195.26	is another human being saying,
195.26	"""Do you understand this?"""
198.454	And that's what was happening
199.872	with the interaction
199.872	with my cousins before,
201.991	and now they can just do it
201.991	in the intimacy of their own room.
208.573	The other thing that happened is --
210.294	I put them on YouTube just --
213.811	I saw no reason to make it private,
215.634	so I let other people watch it,
217.26	and then people started stumbling on it,
219.26	and I started getting
219.26	some comments and some letters
222.782	and all sorts of feedback
225.012	from random people around the world.
226.972	These are just a few.
229.922	This is actually from one
229.922	of the original calculus videos.
233.44	Someone wrote it on YouTube,
233.44	it was a YouTube comment:
236.545	"""First time I smiled doing a derivative."""
239.26	(Laughter)
242.18	Let's pause here.
244.006	This person did a derivative,
245.982	and then they smiled.
247.183	(Laughter)
248.988	In response to that same comment --
250.695	this is on the thread, you can go
250.695	on YouTube and look at the comments --
254.17	"someone else wrote: ""Same thing here."
255.972	I actually got a natural high
255.972	and a good mood for the entire day,
259.069	since I remember seeing
259.069	all of this matrix text in class,
263.521	"and here I'm all like, 'I know kung fu.'"""
266.26	(Laughter)
270.545	We get a lot of feedback
270.545	along those lines.
272.92	This clearly was helping people.
274.625	But then, as the viewership
274.625	kept growing and kept growing,
278.351	I started getting letters from people,
280.946	and it was starting to become clear
282.707	that it was more than just a nice-to-have.
284.813	This is just an excerpt
284.813	from one of those letters:
288.26	"""My 12 year-old son has autism,"
290.755	and has had a terrible time with math.
293.001	We have tried everything,
294.26	viewed everything, bought everything.
296.26	We stumbled on your video
296.26	on decimals, and it got through.
299.969	Then we went on to the dreaded fractions.
301.977	Again, he got it.
303.152	We could not believe it.
304.342	"He is so excited."""
306.444	And so you can imagine,
307.834	here I was, an analyst at a hedge fund --
311.992	it was very strange for me to do
311.992	something of social value.
315.285	(Laughter)
317.26	(Applause)
323.964	But I was excited, so I kept going.
327.26	And then a few other things
327.26	started to dawn on me;
329.982	that not only would it
329.982	help my cousins right now,
332.474	or these people who were sending letters,
334.553	but that this content will never grow old,
337.449	that it could help their kids
337.449	or their grandkids.
340.767	If Isaac Newton had done
340.767	YouTube videos on calculus,
345.553	I wouldn't have to.
346.815	(Laughter)
348.624	Assuming he was good. We don't know.
351.26	(Laughter)
353.886	The other thing that happened --
353.886	and even at this point, I said,
356.95	"""OK, maybe it's a good supplement."
356.95	It's good for motivated students.
360.188	"It's good for maybe home-schoolers."""
362.038	But I didn't think it would somehow
362.038	penetrate the classroom.
365.337	Then I started getting
365.337	letters from teachers,
367.487	and the teachers would write, saying,
369.336	"""We've used your videos"
369.336	to flip the classroom.
371.581	You've given the lectures,
371.581	"so now what we do --"""
374.182	And this could happen in every classroom
374.182	in America tomorrow --
377.744	"""what I do is I assign"
377.744	the lectures for homework,
381.022	and what used to be homework,
383.069	I now have the students
383.069	"doing in the classroom."""
386.045	And I want to pause here --
388.537	(Applause)
393.154	I want to pause here, because there's
393.154	a couple of interesting things.
396.475	One, when those teachers are doing that,
398.7	there's the obvious benefit --
400.26	the benefit that now their students
402.784	can enjoy the videos in the way
402.784	that my cousins did,
405.33	they can pause, repeat at their
405.33	own pace, at their own time.
408.76	But the more interesting thing --
408.76	and this is the unintuitive thing
411.965	when you talk about technology
411.965	in the classroom --
414.367	by removing the one-size-fits-all
414.367	lecture from the classroom,
417.277	and letting students have
417.277	a self-paced lecture at home,
420.301	then when you go to the classroom,
421.976	letting them do work,
421.976	having the teacher walk around,
424.5	having the peers actually be able
424.5	to interact with each other,
427.61	these teachers have used technology
427.61	to humanize the classroom.
433.268	They took a fundamentally
433.268	dehumanizing experience --
438.269	not allowed to interact with each other.
440.247	A teacher, no matter how good,
441.763	has to give this one-size-fits-all
441.763	lecture to 30 students --
445.096	blank faces, slightly antagonistic --
447.483	and now it's a human experience,
449.078	now they're actually
449.078	interacting with each other.
451.411	So once the Khan Academy --
454.22	I quit my job,
455.396	and we turned into a real organization --
457.864	we're a not-for-profit --
459.681	the question is, how do we take this
459.681	to the next level?
462.799	How do we take what those teachers
462.799	were doing to its natural conclusion?
466.331	And so, what I'm showing over here,
468.26	these are actual exercises
470.918	that I started writing for my cousins.
473.26	The ones I started
473.26	were much more primitive.
475.38	This is a more competent version of it.
478.774	But the paradigm here is, we'll generate
478.774	as many questions as you need,
482.187	until you get that concept,
482.187	until you get 10 in a row.
485.26	And the Khan Academy videos are there.
487.26	You get hints, the actual
487.26	steps for that problem,
489.617	if you don't know how to do it.
491.598	The paradigm here seems
491.598	like a very simple thing:
495.154	But it's fundamentally different
496.758	than what's happening
496.758	in classrooms right now.
499.069	In a traditional classroom,
500.995	you have homework, lecture,
500.995	homework, lecture,
504.26	and then you have a snapshot exam.
506.123	And that exam, whether you get
506.123	a 70 percent, an 80 percent,
509.804	a 90 percent or a 95 percent,
511.273	the class moves on to the next topic.
513.74	And even that 95 percent student --
515.509	what was the five percent
515.509	they didn't know?
517.542	Maybe they didn't know what happens when
517.542	you raise something to the zeroth power.
521.387	Then you build on that
521.387	in the next concept.
523.66	That's analogous to --
523.66	imagine learning to ride a bicycle.
527.024	Maybe I give you a lecture ahead of time,
529.917	and I give you a bicycle for two weeks,
529.917	then I come back after two weeks,
533.854	"and say, ""Well, let's see."
533.854	You're having trouble taking left turns.
537.028	You can't quite stop.
537.028	"You're an 80 percent bicyclist."""
540.289	"So I put a big ""C"" stamp"
540.289	on your forehead --
542.735	(Laughter)
543.821	"and then I say, ""Here's a unicycle."""
545.607	(Laughter)
546.725	But as ridiculous as that sounds,
548.584	that's exactly what's happening
548.584	in our classrooms right now.
552.26	And the idea is you fast forward
554.893	and good students start failing
554.893	algebra all of the sudden,
557.903	and start failing
557.903	calculus all of the sudden,
560.231	despite being smart,
560.231	despite having good teachers,
562.613	and it's usually because they have
562.613	these Swiss cheese gaps
565.381	that kept building
565.381	throughout their foundation.
567.614	So our model is: learn math
567.614	the way you'd learn anything,
571.216	like riding a bicycle.
572.586	Stay on that bicycle.
572.586	Fall off that bicycle.
575.681	Do it as long as necessary,
575.681	until you have mastery.
578.736	The traditional model,
580.26	it penalizes you
580.26	for experimentation and failure,
582.856	but it does not expect mastery.
584.903	We encourage you to experiment.
584.903	We encourage you to fail.
587.991	But we do expect mastery.
591.181	This is just another one of the modules.
593.125	This is trigonometry.
594.569	This is shifting and reflecting functions.
597.831	And they all fit together.
599.259	We have about 90 of these right now.
601.241	You can go to the site right now,
602.874	it's all free,
602.874	not trying to sell anything.
604.97	But the general idea is that they all
604.97	fit into this knowledge map.
608.134	That top node right there,
608.134	that's literally single-digit addition,
611.277	it's like one plus one is equal to two.
613.576	The paradigm is, once you get
615.952	it keeps forwarding you
615.952	to more and more advanced modules.
619.159	Further down the knowledge map,
622.262	we're getting into more
622.262	advanced arithmetic.
624.533	Further down, you start getting
624.533	into pre-algebra and early algebra.
627.73	Further down, you start getting
627.73	into algebra one, algebra two,
631.497	a little bit of precalculus.
633.402	And the idea is, from this we can
633.402	actually teach everything --
636.623	well, everything that can be taught
636.623	in this type of a framework.
640.489	So you can imagine -- and this
640.489	is what we are working on --
643.322	from this knowledge map, you have
643.322	logic, you have computer programming,
646.909	you have grammar, you have genetics,
649.433	all based off of that core of,
649.433	if you know this and that,
652.616	now you're ready for this next concept.
655.869	Now that can work well
655.869	for an individual learner,
658.195	and I encourage you
658.195	to do it with your kids,
660.351	but I also encourage everyone
660.351	in the audience to do it yourself.
663.414	It'll change what happens
663.414	at the dinner table.
665.64	But what we want to do
666.82	is use the natural conclusion
666.82	of the flipping of the classroom
669.922	that those early teachers
669.922	had emailed me about.
672.319	And so what I'm showing you here,
673.936	this is data from a pilot
673.936	in the Los Altos school district,
676.848	where they took two fifth-grade classes
676.848	and two seventh-grade classes,
680.188	and completely gutted
680.188	their old math curriculum.
682.463	These kids aren't using textbooks,
682.463	or getting one-size-fits-all lectures.
685.922	They're doing Khan Academy, that software,
685.922	for roughly half of their math class.
689.939	I want to be clear: we don't view this
689.939	as a complete math education.
693.17	What it does is -- this is
693.17	what's happening in Los Altos --
696.092	it frees up time --
696.092	it's the blocking and tackling,
698.517	making sure you know how to move
698.517	through a system of equations,
701.517	and it frees up time
701.517	for the simulations, for the games,
704.176	for the mechanics, for the robot-building,
706.216	for the estimating how high
706.216	that hill is based on its shadow.
709.122	And so the paradigm is
709.122	the teacher walks in every day,
711.702	every kid works at their own pace --
713.504	this is actually a live dashboard
713.504	from the Los Altos school district --
717.059	and they look at this dashboard.
718.654	Every row is a student.
720.368	Every column is one of those concepts.
722.26	Green means the student's
722.26	already proficient.
724.427	Blue means they're working
724.427	on it -- no need to worry.
726.975	Red means they're stuck.
728.688	And what the teacher does
728.688	is literally just say,
731.957	"""Let me intervene on the red kids."""
733.656	"Or even better, ""Let me get"
733.656	one of the green kids,
736.045	who are already proficient
736.045	in that concept,
738.115	to be the first line of attack,
738.115	"and actually tutor their peer."""
743.26	(Applause)
748.885	Now, I come from a very
748.885	data-centric reality,
752.26	so we don't want that teacher
752.26	to even go and intervene
755.023	and have to ask the kid awkward questions:
757.093	"""What don't you understand? What do"
757.093	"you understand?"" and all the rest."
760.427	So our paradigm is to arm teachers
760.427	with as much data as possible --
763.686	data that, in any other
763.686	field, is expected,
765.76	in finance, marketing, manufacturing --
767.823	so the teachers can diagnose
767.823	what's wrong with the students
770.644	so they can make their interaction
770.644	as productive as possible.
773.556	Now teachers know exactly
773.556	what the students have been up to,
776.414	how long they've spent each day,
776.414	what videos they've watched,
779.323	when did they pause the videos,
779.323	what did they stop watching,
782.181	what exercises are they using,
782.181	what have they focused on?
784.928	The outer circle shows
784.928	what exercises they were focused on.
787.825	The inner circle shows
787.825	the videos they're focused on.
791.141	The data gets pretty granular,
792.602	so you can see the exact problems
792.602	the student got right or wrong.
795.713	Red is wrong, blue is right.
797.466	The leftmost question is the first one
797.466	the student attempted.
800.464	They watched the video over there.
802.13	And you can see, eventually
802.13	they were able to get 10 in a row.
805.098	It's almost like you can see them
805.098	learning over those last 10 problems.
808.477	They also got faster -- the height
808.477	is how long it took them.
813.481	When you talk about self-paced learning,
813.481	it makes sense for everyone --
818.004	in education-speak,
818.004	"""differentiated learning"" --"
820.449	but it's kind of crazy, what happens
820.449	when you see it in a classroom.
824.155	Because every time we've done this,
824.155	in every classroom we've done,
828.623	over and over again,
828.623	if you go five days into it,
830.971	there's a group of kids who've raced ahead
833.008	and a group who are a little bit slower.
834.945	In a traditional model,
834.945	in a snapshot assessment,
837.372	"you say, ""These are the gifted kids,"
837.372	these are the slow kids.
840.308	Maybe they should be tracked differently.
842.3	Maybe we should put them
842.3	"in different classes."""
844.554	But when you let students
844.554	work at their own pace --
846.982	we see it over and over again --
848.607	you see students who took
848.607	a little bit extra time
851.056	on one concept or the other,
852.931	but once they get through that concept,
855.151	they just race ahead.
856.523	And so the same kids that you
856.523	thought were slow six weeks ago,
859.919	you now would think are gifted.
861.602	And we're seeing it over and over again.
863.618	It makes you really wonder
865.427	how much all of the labels maybe
865.427	a lot of us have benefited from
868.75	were really just due
868.75	to a coincidence of time.
874.487	Now as valuable as something like this is
874.487	in a district like Los Altos,
879.543	our goal is to use technology
881.26	to humanize, not just in Los Altos,
881.26	but on a global scale,
884.26	what's happening in education.
886.787	And that brings up an interesting point.
889.112	A lot of the effort
889.112	in humanizing the classroom
891.866	is focused on student-to-teacher ratios.
894.81	In our mind, the relevant metric is:
897.333	student-to-valuable-human-time-
897.333	with-the-teacher ratio.
901.259	So in a traditional model,
901.259	most of the teacher's time
903.808	is spent doing lectures
903.808	and grading and whatnot.
906.204	Maybe five percent of their time
906.204	is sitting next to students
909.124	and working with them.
910.308	Now, 100 percent of their time is.
912.339	So once again, using technology,
912.339	not just flipping the classroom,
915.633	you're humanizing
915.633	the classroom, I'd argue,
918.015	by a factor of five or 10.
920.656	As valuable as that is in Los Altos,
922.41	imagine what it does to the adult learner,
924.475	who's embarrassed to go back
924.475	and learn stuff
926.562	they should have known
926.562	before going back to college.
929.038	Imagine what it does
929.038	to a street kid in Calcutta,
934.995	who has to help his family during the day,
937.761	and that's the reason
937.761	he or she can't go to school.
940.191	Now they can spend two hours
940.191	a day and remediate,
942.698	or get up to speed
942.698	and not feel embarrassed
945.047	about what they do or don't know.
947.666	Now imagine what happens where --
949.318	we talked about the peers
949.318	teaching each other
952.253	inside of a classroom.
954.086	But this is all one system.
955.84	There's no reason why you can't
955.84	have that peer-to-peer tutoring
959.166	beyond that one classroom.
961.26	Imagine what happens
961.26	if that student in Calcutta
964.26	all of the sudden can tutor your son,
966.452	or your son can tutor
966.452	that kid in Calcutta.
969.381	And I think what you'll see emerging
971.26	is this notion of a global
971.26	one-world classroom.
977.862	And that's essentially
977.862	what we're trying to build.
981.822	Thank you.
982.998	(Applause)
991.22	Bill Gates: I'll ask about two
991.22	or three questions.
993.68	Salman Khan: Oh, OK.
995.426	(Applause continues)
1022.971	(Applause ends)
1024.344	BG: I've seen some things
1024.344	you're doing in the system,
1027.304	that have to do with motivation
1027.304	and feedback --
1029.765	energy points, merit badges.
1032.26	Tell me what you're thinking there.
1034.315	SK: Oh yeah. No, we have
1034.315	an awesome team working on it.
1036.935	I have to be clear,
1036.935	it's not just me anymore.
1039.062	I'm still doing all the videos,
1040.571	but we have a rock-star team
1040.571	doing the software.
1042.897	We've put a bunch of game mechanics
1042.897	in there, where you get badges,
1046.08	we're going to start having leader boards
1046.08	by area, you get points.
1049.363	It's actually been pretty interesting.
1051.213	Just the wording of the badging,
1052.796	or how many points you get
1052.796	for doing something,
1055.027	we see on a system-wide basis,
1056.688	like tens of thousands
1056.688	of fifth-graders or sixth-graders
1059.35	going one direction or another,
1059.35	depending what badge you give them.
1062.549	(Laughter)
1064.636	BG: And the collaboration
1064.636	you're doing with Los Altos,
1067.26	how did that come about?
1069.461	SK: Los Altos, it was kind of crazy.
1072.524	Once again, I didn't expect it
1072.524	to be used in classrooms.
1075.357	Someone from their board came and said,
1077.26	"""What would you do if you had"
1077.26	"carte Blanche in a classroom?"""
1080.111	"I said, ""Well, every student"
1080.111	would work at their own pace,
1083.151	on something like this,
1083.151	"we'd give a dashboard."""
1085.372	"They said, ""This is kind of radical."
1085.372	"We have to think about it."""
1088.595	Me and the rest of the team were like,
1088.595	"""They're never going to want to do this."""
1092.421	But literally the next day they were like,
1092.421	"""Can you start in two weeks?"""
1095.866	(Laughter)
1097.341	BG: So fifth-grade math
1097.341	is where that's going on right now?
1100.262	SK: It's two fifth-grade classes
1100.262	and two seventh-grade classes.
1103.285	They're doing it at the district level.
1105.175	I think what they're excited about
1105.175	is they can follow these kids,
1108.271	not only in school; on Christmas,
1108.271	we saw some of the kids were doing it.
1111.708	We can track everything, track them
1111.708	as they go through the entire district.
1115.26	Through the summers, as they go
1115.26	from one teacher to the next,
1118.212	you have this continuity of data that
1118.212	even at the district level, they can see.
1122.036	BG: So some of those views we saw
1122.036	were for the teacher
1125.26	to go in and track actually
1125.26	what's going on with those kids.
1128.975	So you're getting feedback
1128.975	on those teacher views
1131.325	to see what they think they need?
1133.062	SK: Oh yeah. Most of those
1133.062	were specs by the teachers.
1137.442	We made some of those for students
1137.442	so they could see their data,
1140.476	but we have a very tight design loop
1140.476	with the teachers themselves.
1143.612	And they're saying,
1143.612	"""Hey, this is nice, but --"""
1145.86	Like that focus graph,
1145.86	a lot of the teachers said,
1148.273	"""I have a feeling a lot of the kids"
1148.273	are jumping around
1150.837	"and not focusing on one topic."""
1152.463	So we made that focus diagram.
1153.96	So it's all been teacher-driven.
1153.96	It's been pretty crazy.
1156.624	BG: Is this ready for prime time?
1158.221	Do you think a lot of classes next school
1158.221	year should try this thing out?
1162.599	SK: Yeah, it's ready.
1163.781	We've got a million people
1163.781	on the site already,
1166.523	so we can handle a few more.
1169.479	(Laughter)
1171.26	No, no reason why it really can't happen
1173.26	in every classroom in America tomorrow.
1175.894	BG: And the vision of the tutoring thing.
1178.398	The idea there is,
1178.398	if I'm confused about a topic,
1181.26	somehow right in the user interface,
1183.436	I'd find people who are volunteering,
1185.596	maybe see their reputation,
1187.358	and I could schedule and connect up
1187.358	with those people?
1190.559	SK: Absolutely. And this is something
1190.559	I recommend everyone in this audience do.
1194.332	Those dashboards the teachers have,
1194.332	you can go log in right now
1197.418	and you can essentially become a coach
1199.26	for your kids, your nephews, your cousins,
1202.26	or maybe some kids
1202.26	at the Boys and Girls Club.
1205.113	And yeah, you can start
1205.113	becoming a mentor, a tutor,
1207.669	really immediately.
1209.165	But yeah, it's all there.
1211.15	BG: Well, it's amazing.
1212.332	I think you just got a glimpse
1212.332	of the future of education.
1215.418	BG: Thank you.
1215.418	SK: Thank you.
1217.26	(Applause)
