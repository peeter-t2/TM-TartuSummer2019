16.162	Doc Edgerton inspired us
16.162	with awe and curiosity
22.14	with this photo of a bullet
22.14	piercing through an apple,
27.402	and exposure just a millionth of a second.
32.921	But now, 50 years later,
32.921	we can go a million times faster
39.834	and see the world
39.834	not at a million or a billion,
44.62	but one trillion frames per second.
49.125	I present to you
49.125	a new type of photography,
52.813	femto-photography,
54.872	a new imaging technique so fast
59.472	that it can create slow motion
59.472	videos of light in motion.
64.673	And with that, we can create cameras
64.673	that can look around corners,
69.556	beyond line of sight,
71.553	or see inside our body without an x-ray,
76.433	and really challenge
76.433	what we mean by a camera.
81.7	Now if I take a laser pointer
81.7	and turn it on and off
84.858	in one trillionth of a second --
87.685	which is several femtoseconds --
90.496	I'll create a packet of photons
90.496	barely a millimeter wide.
95.62	And that packet of photons, that bullet,
98.053	will travel at the speed of light,
100.003	and again, a million times faster
100.003	than an ordinary bullet.
104.882	Now, if you take that bullet
104.882	and take this packet of photons
109.417	and fire into this bottle,
112.773	how will those photons
112.773	shatter into this bottle?
117.124	How does light look in slow motion?
119.812	[Light in Slow Motion ...
141.301	Now, the whole event --
142.872	(Applause)
149.883	Now remember, the whole event
149.883	is effectively taking place
153.408	in less than a nanosecond --
155.095	that's how much time
155.095	it takes for light to travel.
157.52	But I'm slowing down in this video
157.52	by a factor of 10 billion,
162.191	so you can see the light in motion.
164.763	(Laughter)
165.857	But Coca-Cola did not
165.857	sponsor this research.
168.168	(Laughter)
170.294	Now, there's a lot going on in this movie,
172.341	so let me break this down
172.341	and show you what's going on.
174.985	So the pulse enters
174.985	the bottle, our bullet,
177.943	with a packet of photons
177.943	that start traveling through
180.505	and that start scattering inside.
182.342	Some of the light leaks,
182.342	goes on the table,
184.573	and you start seeing
184.573	these ripples of waves.
187.209	Many of the photons
187.209	eventually reach the cap
190.241	and then they explode
190.241	in various directions.
193.155	As you can see, there's a bubble of air
195.067	and it's bouncing around inside.
196.733	Meanwhile, the ripples
196.733	are traveling on the table,
199.207	and because of the reflections at the top,
201.231	you see at the back of the bottle,
201.231	after several frames,
205.002	the reflections are focused.
208.47	Now, if you take an ordinary bullet
213.883	and let it go the same distance
213.883	and slow down the video --
216.907	again, by a factor of 10 billion --
219.152	do you know how long you'll have to sit
219.152	here to watch that movie?
223.569	(Laughter)
225.181	A day, a week? Actually, a whole year.
229.569	It'll be a very boring movie --
231.85	(Laughter)
233.265	of a slow, ordinary bullet in motion.
237.96	And what about some
237.96	still-life photography?
248.372	You can watch the ripples,
248.372	again, washing over the table,
253.382	the tomato and the wall in the back.
256.064	It's like throwing a stone
256.064	in a pond of water.
262.663	I thought: this is how
262.663	nature paints a photo,
266.347	one femto frame at a time,
268.934	but of course our eye sees
268.934	an integral composite.
275.183	But if you look at this tomato
275.183	one more time,
277.341	you will notice, as the light
277.341	washes over the tomato,
280.11	it continues to glow.
281.798	It doesn't become dark. Why is that?
283.849	Because the tomato is actually ripe,
286.171	and the light is bouncing
286.171	around inside the tomato,
288.584	and it comes out after several
288.584	trillionths of a second.
292.974	So in the future, when this femto-camera
292.974	is in your camera phone,
297.337	you might be able to go to a supermarket
299.315	and check if the fruit is ripe
299.315	without actually touching it.
302.394	(Laughter)
304.104	So how did my team at MIT
304.104	create this camera?
309.166	Now, as photographers, you know,
311.134	if you take a short exposure photo,
311.134	you get very little light.
315.119	But we're going to go a billion times
315.119	faster than your shortest exposure,
318.651	so you're going to get hardly any light.
320.604	So what we do is we send that bullet --
322.541	that packet of photons --
322.541	millions of times,
325.061	and record again and again
325.061	with very clever synchronization,
328.168	and from the gigabytes of data,
330.131	we computationally weave together
332.375	to create those femto-videos I showed you.
336.456	And we can take all that raw data
336.456	and treat it in very interesting ways.
341.275	So, Superman can fly.
343.116	Some other heroes can become invisible.
345.87	But what about a new power
345.87	for a future superhero:
350.676	To see around corners.
353.354	The idea is that we could
353.354	shine some light on the door,
357.847	it's going to bounce, go inside the room,
360.522	some of that is going to reflect
360.522	back on the door,
362.952	and then back to the camera.
364.459	And we could exploit
364.459	these multiple bounces of light.
367.947	And it's not science fiction.
367.947	We have actually built it.
370.638	On the left, you see our femto-camera.
372.728	There's a mannequin hidden behind a wall,
375.107	and we're going to bounce
375.107	light off the door.
378.009	So after our paper was published
378.009	in Nature Communications,
381.526	it was highlighted by Nature.com,
383.692	and they created this animation.
386.192	(Music)
387.5	[A laser pulse is fired]
390.388	(Music)
393.284	Ramesh Raskar: We're going to fire
393.284	those bullets of light,
396.175	and they're going to hit this wall,
399.575	and because of the packet of the photons,
402.23	they will scatter in all the directions,
404.364	and some of them will reach
404.364	our hidden mannequin,
406.729	which in turn will again
406.729	scatter that light,
410.135	and again in turn, the door will reflect
410.135	some of that scattered light.
415.943	And a tiny fraction of the photons
415.943	will actually come back to the camera,
419.463	but most interestingly,
420.638	they will all arrive
420.638	at a slightly different time slot.
424.186	(Music)
429.043	And because we have a camera
429.043	that can run so fast --
431.58	our femto-camera --
431.58	it has some unique abilities.
434.686	It has very good time resolution,
437.528	and it can look at the world
437.528	at the speed of light.
441.374	And this way, we know the distances,
441.374	of course to the door,
444.655	but also to the hidden objects,
446.456	but we don't know which point
446.456	corresponds to which distance.
449.637	(Music)
453.706	By shining one laser,
453.706	we can record one raw photo,
457.16	which, if you look on the screen,
457.16	doesn't really make any sense.
460.208	But then we will take
460.208	a lot of such pictures,
462.352	dozens of such pictures,
462.352	put them together,
464.536	and try to analyze
464.536	the multiple bounces of light,
467.018	and from that, can we see
467.018	the hidden object?
470.493	Can we see it in full 3D?
473.373	So this is our reconstruction.
475.326	(Music)
480.48	(Applause)
488.051	Now, we have some ways to go
489.544	before we take this
489.544	outside the lab on the road,
492.703	but in the future, we could create
492.703	cars that avoid collisions
496.456	with what's around the bend.
498.841	Or we can look for survivors
498.841	in hazardous conditions
502.952	by looking at light reflected
502.952	through open windows.
506.864	Or we can build endoscopes that can see
506.864	deep inside the body around occluders,
512.759	and also for cardioscopes.
514.483	But of course,
514.483	because of tissue and blood,
516.873	this is quite challenging,
518.152	so this is really a call for scientists
520.111	to start thinking about femto-photography
522.442	as really a new imaging modality
524.347	to solve the next generation
524.347	of health-imaging problems.
528.342	Now, like Doc Edgerton,
528.342	a scientist himself,
532.223	science became art --
534.55	an art of ultra-fast photography.
538.14	And I realized
539.315	that all the gigabytes of data
539.315	that we're collecting every time,
542.78	are not just for scientific imaging.
545.225	But we can also do a new form
545.225	of computational photography,
550.788	with time-lapse and color coding.
554.407	And we look at those ripples.
555.9	Remember:
557.082	The time between each of those ripples
557.082	is only a few trillionths of a second.
563.862	But there's also something
563.862	funny going on here.
566.093	When you look at the ripples
566.093	under the cap,
568.913	the ripples are moving away from us.
572.111	The ripples should be moving towards us.
574.049	What's going on here?
575.445	It turns out, because we're recording
575.445	nearly at the speed of light,
582.259	we have strange effects,
584.172	and Einstein would have loved
584.172	to see this picture.
587.457	(Laughter)
588.52	The order at which events
588.52	take place in the world
591.591	appears in the camera
591.591	sometimes in reversed order.
596.306	So by applying the corresponding
596.306	space and time warp,
599.525	we can correct for this distortion.
603.866	So whether it's for photography
603.866	around corners,
608.239	or creating the next generation
608.239	of health imaging,
612.259	or creating new visualizations,
615.175	since our invention,
616.823	we have open-sourced all the data
616.823	and details on our website,
621.972	and our hope is that the DIY,
621.972	the creative and the research communities
628.949	will show us that we should stop obsessing
628.949	about the megapixels in cameras --
634.478	(Laughter)
635.781	and start focusing
635.781	on the next dimension in imaging.
640.867	It's about time.
642.597	Thank you.
643.773	(Applause)
