12.929	I am multidisciplinary.
14.816	As a scientist, I've been a crew commander
14.816	for a NASA Mars simulation last year,
19.799	and as an artist, I create multicultural
19.799	community art all over the planet.
26.718	And recently, I've actually
26.718	been combining both.
29.622	But let me first talk a little more
29.622	about that NASA mission.
33.337	This is the HI-SEAS program.
35.24	HI-SEAS is a NASA-funded
35.24	planetary surface analogue
38.936	on the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii,
41.664	and it's a research program
41.664	that is specifically designed
44.69	to study the effects
44.69	of long-term isolation of small crews.
49.729	I lived in this dome for four months
49.729	with a crew of six,
53.601	a very interesting experience, of course.
56.386	We did all kinds of research.
59.469	Our main research
59.469	was actually a food study,
61.821	but apart from that food study --
63.7	developing a new food system
63.7	for astronauts living in deep space --
67.488	we also did all kinds of other research.
69.621	We did extra-vehicular activities,
69.621	as you can see here,
72.942	wearing mock-up space suits,
74.986	but we also had our chores
74.986	and lots of other stuff to do,
77.655	like questionnaires
77.655	at the end of every day.
79.907	Busy, busy work.
81.7	Now, as you can imagine,
83.752	it's quite challenging to live
83.752	with just a small group of people
86.804	in a small space for a long time.
88.987	There's all kinds
88.987	of psychological challenges:
91.216	how to keep a team together
91.216	in these circumstances;
95.092	how to deal with the warping of time
95.092	you start to sense
97.822	when you're living in these circumstances;
100.015	sleep problems that arise; etc.
101.949	But also we learned a lot.
104.033	I learned a lot about
104.033	how individual crew members
106.749	actually cope with a situation like this;
109.419	how you can keep a crew
109.419	productive and happy,
112.926	for example, giving them
112.926	a good deal of autonomy
115.526	is a good trick to do that;
117.058	and honestly, I learned
117.058	a lot about leadership,
120.047	because I was a crew commander.
121.935	So doing this mission,
123.839	I really started thinking more deeply
123.839	about our future in outer space.
128.725	We will venture into outer space,
128.725	and we will start inhabiting outer space.
132.394	I have no doubt about it.
134.159	It might take 50 years
134.159	or it might take 500 years,
137.744	but it's going to happen nevertheless.
140.443	So I came up with
140.443	a new art project called Seeker.
144.434	And the Seeker project is actually
144.434	challenging communities all over the world
148.355	to come up with starship prototypes
151.209	that re-envision
151.209	human habitation and survival.
154.513	That's the core of the project.
156.382	Now, one important thing:
158.739	This is not a dystopian project.
161.244	"This is not about, ""Oh my God,"
161.244	the world is going wrong
163.956	and we have to escape because we need
163.956	"another future somewhere else."""
167.218	No, no.
169.029	The project is basically inviting people
171.696	to take a step away
171.696	from earthbound constraints
174.661	and, as such, reimagine our future.
177.319	And it's really helpful,
177.319	and it works really well,
180.003	so that's really the important part
180.003	of what we're doing.
184.26	Now, in this project,
184.26	I'm using a cocreation approach,
188.988	which is a slightly different approach
191.078	from what you would expect
191.078	from many artists.
193.58	I'm essentially dropping a basic idea
193.58	into a group, into a community,
197.963	people start gravitating to the idea,
200.491	and together, we shape 
200.491	and build the artwork.
203.851	It's a little bit like termites, really.
206.018	We just work together,
207.308	and even, for example,
207.308	when architects visit what we're doing,
210.264	sometimes they have a bit
210.264	of a hard time understanding
212.849	how we build without a master plan.
214.527	We always come up with these
214.527	fantastic large-scale scupltures
217.986	that actually we can also inhabit.
221.678	The first version was done
221.678	in Belgium and Holland.
225.022	It was built with a team
225.022	of almost 50 people.
227.924	This is the second iteration
227.924	of that same project,
230.785	but in Slovenia, in a different country,
232.745	and the new group was like, we're going 
232.745	to do the architecture differently.
236.987	So they took away the architecture,
236.987	they kept the base of the artwork,
240.291	and they built an entirely new,
242.343	much more biomorphic
242.343	architecture on top of that.
245.014	And that's another
245.014	crucial part of the project.
247.429	It's an evolving artwork,
247.429	evolving architecture.
251.31	This was the last version that was just
251.31	presented a few weeks ago in Holland,
255.137	which was using caravans 
255.137	as modules to build a starship.
259.282	We bought some second-hand caravans,
261.308	cut them open,
262.605	and reassembled them into a starship.
265.342	Now, when we're thinking about starships,
268.249	we're not just approaching it
268.249	as a technological challenge.
271.287	We're really looking at it
271.287	as a combination of three systems:
274.215	ecology, people and technology.
276.596	So there's always a strong ecological
276.596	component in the project.
280.154	Here you can see aquaponic systems
282.523	that are actually
282.523	surrounding the astronauts,
284.727	so they're constantly in contact
284.727	with part of the food that they're eating.
290.659	Now, a very typical thing for this project
293.695	is that we run our own isolation missions
293.695	inside these art and design projects.
300.773	We actually lock ourselves up
300.773	for multiple days on end,
303.747	and test what we build.
305.447	And this is, for example,
306.875	on the right hand side
306.875	you can see an isolation mission
309.489	in the Museum of Modern Art
309.489	in Ljubljana in Slovenia,
312.407	where six artists and designers
312.407	locked themselves up --
315.025	I was part of that --
316.935	for four days inside the museum.
319.173	And, of course, obviously,
319.173	this is a very performative
321.928	and very strong experience for all of us.
326.13	Now, the next version of the project
326.13	is currently being developed
330.549	together with Camilo Rodriguez-Beltran,
330.549	who is also a TED Fellow,
334.512	in the Atacama Desert in Chile,
334.512	a magical place.
338.788	First of all, it's really
338.788	considered a Mars analogue.
341.896	It really does look like Mars
341.896	in certain locations
344.59	and has been used by NASA
344.59	to test equipment.
348.119	And it has a long history
348.119	of being connected to space
351.222	through observations of the stars.
353.977	It's now home to ALMA,
355.645	the large telescope
355.645	that's being developed there.
359.183	But also, it's the driest
359.183	location on the planet,
363.143	and that makes it extremely interesting
363.143	to build our project,
366.144	because suddenly, sustainability
366.144	is something we have to explore fully.
371.829	We have no other option,
373.661	so I'm very curious to see
373.661	what's going to happen.
376.074	Now, a specific thing for this
376.074	particular version of the project
380.231	is that I'm very interested to see
382.413	how we can connect
382.413	with the local population,
384.569	the native population.
385.802	These people have been living there
385.802	for a very long time
388.544	and can be considered
388.544	experts in sustainability,
391.516	and so I'm very interested
391.516	to see what we can learn from them,
394.487	and have an input of indigenous knowledge
394.487	into space exploration.
398.719	So we're trying to redefine
398.719	how we look at our future in outer space
403.598	by exploring integration,
403.598	biology, technology and people;
408.002	by using a cocreation approach;
410.652	and by using and exploring
410.652	local traditions
414.099	and to see how we can learn from the past
414.099	and integrate that into our deep future.
418.528	Thank you.
420.321	(Applause)
