13.596	Here are two reasons companies fail:
17.208	they only do more of the same,
20.478	or they only do what's new.
23.613	To me the real, real
23.613	solution to quality growth
28.537	is figuring out the balance
28.537	between two activities:
32.126	exploration and exploitation.
35.114	Both are necessary,
36.728	but it can be too much of a good thing.
41.154	Consider Facit.
43.061	I'm actually old enough to remember them.
45.489	Facit was a fantastic company.
47.999	They were born deep in the Swedish forest,
50.496	and they made the best
50.496	mechanical calculators in the world.
54.524	Everybody used them.
56.798	And what did Facit do when
56.798	the electronic calculator came along?
61.691	They continued doing exactly the same.
64.953	In six months, they went
64.953	from maximum revenue ...
68.695	and they were gone.
70.649	Gone.
71.824	To me, the irony about the Facit story
75.72	is hearing about the Facit engineers,
79.01	who had bought cheap, small
79.01	electronic calculators in Japan
84.117	that they used to double-check
84.117	their calculators.
87.802	(Laughter)
89.239	Facit did too much exploitation.
92.422	But exploration can go wild, too.
94.9	A few years back,
96.075	I worked closely alongside
96.075	a European biotech company.
100.447	Let's call them OncoSearch.
102.83	The company was brilliant.
104.511	They had applications that promised
104.511	to diagnose, even cure,
109.153	certain forms of blood cancer.
112.19	Every day was about
112.19	creating something new.
115.744	They were extremely innovative,
118.272	and the mantra was,
118.272	"""When we only get it right,"""
121.172	"or even, ""We want it perfect."""
124.687	The sad thing is,
126.568	before they became perfect --
128.49	even good enough --
130.443	they became obsolete.
133.331	OncoSearch did too much exploration.
137.602	I first heard about exploration
137.602	and exploitation about 15 years ago,
143.381	when I worked as a visiting
143.381	scholar at Stanford University.
147.428	The founder of the idea is Jim March.
150.168	And to me the power of the idea
150.168	is its practicality.
155.168	Exploration.
156.847	Exploration is about
156.847	coming up with what's new.
160.772	It's about search,
162.027	it's about discovery,
163.494	it's about new products,
165.08	it's about new innovations.
167.591	It's about changing our frontiers.
171.408	Our heroes are people
171.408	who have done exploration:
174.867	Madame Curie,
176.232	Picasso,
177.414	Neil Armstrong,
178.612	Sir Edmund Hillary, etc.
181.21	I come from Norway;
183.569	all our heroes are explorers,
183.569	and they deserve to be.
189.364	We all know that exploration is risky.
192.454	We don't know the answers,
194.297	we don't know if we're going to find them,
196.392	and we know that the risks are high.
198.693	Exploitation is the opposite.
200.608	Exploitation is taking
200.608	the knowledge we have
203.709	and making good, better.
206.344	Exploitation is about making
206.344	our trains run on time.
209.984	It's about making good products
209.984	faster and cheaper.
214.9	Exploitation is not risky --
217.911	in the short term.
219.595	But if we only exploit,
221.425	it's very risky in the long term.
224.503	And I think we all have memories
224.503	of the famous pop groups
228.285	who keep singing the same songs
228.285	again and again,
231.719	until they become obsolete
231.719	or even pathetic.
236.204	That's the risk of exploitation.
240.667	So if we take a long-term
240.667	perspective, we explore.
245.427	If we take a short-term
245.427	perspective, we exploit.
249.693	Small children, they explore all day.
252.88	All day it's about exploration.
255.326	As we grow older,
256.763	we explore less because we have
256.763	more knowledge to exploit on.
261.82	The same goes for companies.
264.706	Companies become,
264.706	by nature, less innovative
268.594	as they become more competent.
271.239	And this is, of course,
271.239	a big worry to CEOs.
275.41	And I hear very often questions
275.41	phrased in different ways.
279.943	For example,
281.125	"""How can I both effectively run"
281.125	"and reinvent my company?"""
286.557	"Or, ""How can I make sure"
288.475	that our company changes
288.475	before we become obsolete
292.86	"or are hit by a crisis?"""
295.584	So, doing one well is difficult.
298.164	Doing both well as the same time is art --
301.955	pushing both exploration and exploitation.
305.138	So one thing we've found
306.658	is only about two percent of companies
306.658	are able to effectively explore
313.378	and exploit at the same time, in parallel.
317.57	But when they do,
319.478	the payoffs are huge.
322.337	So we have lots of great examples.
324.75	We have Nestl√© creating Nespresso,
327.49	we have Lego going into animated films,
330.536	Toyota creating the hybrids,
332.966	Unilever pushing into sustainability --
335.461	there are lots of examples,
335.461	and the benefits are huge.
339.812	Why is balancing so difficult?
342.846	I think it's difficult
342.846	because there are so many traps
345.5	that keep us where we are.
347.975	So I'll talk about two,
347.975	but there are many.
351.098	So let's talk about
351.098	the perpetual search trap.
354.616	We discover something,
356.452	but we don't have the patience
356.452	or the persistence
359.331	to get at it and make it work.
361.683	So instead of staying with it,
361.683	we create something new.
364.852	But the same goes for that,
366.176	then we're in the vicious circle
367.951	of actually coming up with ideas
367.951	but being frustrated.
372.381	OncoSearch was a good example.
374.725	A famous example is, of course, Xerox.
378.607	But we don't only see this in companies.
380.731	We see this in the public sector as well.
383.726	We all know that any kind
383.726	of effective reform of education,
389.472	research, health care, even defense,
391.923	takes 10, 15, maybe 20 years to work.
395.766	But still, we change much more often.
399.09	We really don't give them the chance.
402.424	Another trap is the success trap.
406.808	Facit fell into the success trap.
410.275	They literally held
410.275	the future in their hands,
413.549	but they couldn't see it.
414.787	They were simply so good
414.787	at making what they loved doing,
418.566	that they wouldn't change.
421.187	We are like that, too.
422.504	When we know something well,
422.504	it's difficult to change.
426.872	Bill Gates has said:
429.016	"""Success is a lousy teacher."
432.04	It seduces us into thinking
432.04	"we cannot fail."""
436.457	That's the challenge with success.
439.886	So I think there are some lessons,
439.886	and I think they apply to us.
443.364	And they apply to our companies.
445.57	The first lesson is:
445.57	get ahead of the crisis.
449.949	And any company that's able to innovate
452.542	is actually able to also buy
452.542	an insurance in the future.
456.709	Netflix -- they could so easily
456.709	have been content
459.596	with earlier generations of distribution,
462.484	but they always -- and I think
462.484	they will always --
465.065	keep pushing for the next battle.
467.572	I see other companies that say,
469.961	"""I'll win the next innovation cycle,"
469.961	"whatever it takes."""
475.635	Second one: think in multiple time scales.
478.918	I'll share a chart with you,
480.28	and I think it's a wonderful one.
482.461	Any company we look at,
484.198	taking a one-year perspective
486.021	and looking at the valuation
486.021	of the company,
488.322	innovation typically accounts
488.322	for only about 30 percent.
492.187	So when we think one year,
493.598	innovation isn't really that important.
496.49	Move ahead, take a 10-year perspective
496.49	on the same company --
500.082	suddenly, innovation and ability
500.082	to renew account for 70 percent.
506.253	But companies can't choose.
507.754	They need to fund the journey
507.754	and lead the long term.
512.746	Third:
514.304	invite talent.
515.974	I don't think it's possible for any of us
518.546	to be able to balance exploration
518.546	and exploitation by ourselves.
523.1	I think it's a team sport.
524.83	I think we need to allow challenging.
528.273	I think the mark of a great company
528.273	is being open to be challenged,
533.187	and the mark of a good corporate board
533.187	is to constructively challenge.
538.264	I think that's also what
538.264	good parenting is about.
542.858	Last one: be skeptical of success.
546.133	Maybe it's useful to think back
546.133	at the old triumph marches in Rome,
552.49	when the generals, after a big victory,
556.01	were given their celebration.
558.754	Riding into Rome on the carriage,
561.513	they always had a companion
561.513	whispering in their ear,
565.759	"""Remember, you're only human."""
569.923	So I hope I made the point:
572.701	balancing exploration and exploitation
575.747	has a huge payoff.
577.218	But it's difficult,
577.218	and we need to be conscious.
580.338	I want to just point out two questions
580.338	that I think are useful.
585.397	First question is,
585.397	looking at your own company:
589.446	In which areas do you see
589.446	that the company is at the risk
593.78	of falling into success traps,
596.048	of just going on autopilot?
599.105	And what can you do to challenge?
603.639	Second question is:
606.53	When did I explore something new last,
609.815	and what kind of effect did it have on me?
612.814	Is that something I should do more of?
615.596	In my case, yes.
618.657	So let me leave you with this.
620.692	Whether you're an explorer by nature
623.997	or whether you tend to exploit
623.997	what you already know,
627.923	don't forget: the beauty
627.923	is in the balance.
633.392	Thank you.
634.576	(Applause)
