12.724	If there's any power in design,
15.428	that's the power of synthesis.
17.771	The more complex the problem,
19.466	the more the need for simplicity.
21.967	So allow me to share three cases
24.304	where we tried to apply
26.114	design's power of synthesis.
29.117	Let's start with the global challenge of urbanization.
33.218	It's a fact that people are moving towards cities.
36.896	and even if counterintuitive, it's good news.
40.361	Evidence shows that people are better off in cities.
44.444	But there's a problem that I would call
46.593	"the ""3S"" menace:"
48.899	The scale, speed, and scarcity of means
51.632	with which we will have to
51.632	respond to this phenomenon
54.827	has no precedence in history.
57.465	For you to have an idea,
58.654	out of the three billion 
58.654	people living in cities today,
61.88	one billion are under the line of poverty.
65.271	By 2030, out of the five billion people
69.21	that will be living in cities,
71.48	two billion are going to 
71.48	be under the line of poverty.
74.837	That means that we will have to build
81.605	a one million-person city per week
90.114	with 10,000 dollars per family
95.672	during the next 15 years.
97.482	A one million-person city per week
100.206	with 10,000 dollars per family.
102.33	If we don't solve this equation,
103.995	it is not that people 
103.995	will stop coming to cities.
106.043	They will come anyhow,
107.952	but they will live in slums, favelas
110.958	and informal settlements.
112.368	So what to do? Well, an answer may come
115.246	from favelas and slums themselves.
119.84	A clue could be in this 
119.84	question we were asked
124.89	We were asked to accommodate 100 families
128.521	that had been occupying illegally
130.939	half a hectare in the center
133.234	of the city of Iquique 
133.234	in the north of Chile
136.134	using a $10,000 subsidy
139.062	with which we had to buy the land,
142.176	provide the infrastructure,
143.909	and build the houses that, 
143.909	in the best of the cases,
147.23	would be of around 40 square meters.
150.894	And by the way, they said,
153.099	the cost of the land,
154.75	because it's in the center of the city,
156.806	is three times more
158.55	than what social housing can normally afford.
162.108	Due to the difficulty of the question,
164.334	we decided to include the families
166.516	in the process of understanding the constraints,
170.612	and we started a participatory design process,
173.193	and testing what was 
173.193	available there in the market.
176.84	Detached houses,
181.494	Row houses, 60 families.
185.456	"[""100 families""]"
185.456	The only way to accommodate all of them
188.598	was by building in height,
190.92	and they threatened us
192.552	to go on a hunger strike
194.86	if we even dared to offer this
197.158	as a solution,
198.584	because they could not 
198.584	make the tiny apartments
201.655	expand.
203.109	So the conclusion with the families —
205.798	and this is important, 
205.798	not our conclusion —
207.676	with the families, was that we had a problem.
210.207	We had to innovate.
211.945	So what did we do?
215.72	Well, a middle-class family
219.619	lives reasonably well
222.499	in around 80 square meters,
224.85	but when there's no money,
226.522	what the market does
227.864	is to reduce the size of the house
232.122	to 40 square meters.
234.971	What we said was,
236.719	what if,
240.845	instead of thinking of 40 square meters
245.378	as a small house,
248.059	why don't we consider it
250.385	half of a good one?
253.191	When you rephrase the problem
254.958	as half of a good house
257.664	instead of a small one,
259.299	the key question is, which half do we do?
262.508	And we thought we had 
262.508	to do with public money
265.21	the half that families won't 
265.21	be able to do individually.
270.619	We identified five design conditions
273.147	that belonged to the hard half of a house,
275.505	and we went back to the 
275.505	families to do two things:
278.601	join forces and split tasks.
282.6	Our design was something in between
285.584	a building and a house.
288.265	As a building, it could pay
290.357	for expensive, well-located land,
293.349	and as a house, it could expand.
296.97	If, in the process of not being expelled
299.554	to the periphery while getting a house,
301.92	families kept their 
301.92	network and their jobs,
304.733	we knew that the expansion 
304.733	would begin right away.
308.98	So we went from this initial social housing
313.536	to a middle-class unit achieved
313.536	by families themselves
317.93	within a couple of weeks.
320.666	This was our first project
322.439	in Iquique 10 years ago.
324.766	This is our last project in Chile.
328.243	Different designs, same principle:
331.194	You provide the frame,
332.76	and from then on, families take over.
336.598	So the purpose of design,
340.698	trying to understand and 
340.698	trying to give an answer
343.708	"to the ""3S"" menace,"
345.36	scale, speed, and scarcity,
346.826	is to channel people's own building capacity.
350.309	We won't solve the one million
350.309	people per week equation
354.714	unless we use people's own power for building.
359.399	So, with the right design,
361.634	slums and favelas may not be the problem
365.035	but actually the only possible solution.
368.784	The second case is how design can contribute
371.819	to sustainability.
373.871	In 2012, we entered the competition
376.264	for the Angelini Innovation Center,
378.83	and the aim was to build
380.842	the right environment for knowledge creation.
385.176	It is accepted that for such an aim,
387.66	knowledge creation,
389.196	interaction among people, 
389.196	face-to-face contact,
391.783	it's important, and we agreed on that.
393.98	But for us, the question 
393.98	of the right environment
397.556	was a very literal question.
399.722	We wanted to have a working space
401.842	with the right light, with the right temperature,
404.595	with the right air.
406.477	So we asked ourselves:
408.555	Does the typical office building
411.145	help us in that sense?
413.256	Well, how does that 
413.256	building look, typically?
416.87	It's a collection of floors,
419.454	one on top of each other,
421.361	with a core in the center
424.401	with elevators, stairs, 
424.401	pipes, wires, everything,
429.09	and then a glass skin on the outside
432.677	that, due to direct sun radiation,
436.553	creates a huge greenhouse effect inside.
441.761	In addition to that, let's say a guy
443.695	working on the seventh floor
445.431	goes every single day 
445.431	through the third floor,
448.142	but has no idea what the guy on that floor
451.18	is working on.
452.909	So we thought, well, maybe 
452.909	we have to turn this scheme
456.305	inside out.
458.106	And what we did was,
459.928	let's have an open atrium,
464.11	a hollowed core,
465.999	the same collection of floors,
467.613	but have the walls and the mass in the perimeter,
472.053	so that when the sun hits,
476.317	it's not impacting directly glass, but a wall.
482.444	When you have an open atrium inside,
485.181	you are able to see what others are doing
487.33	from within the building, and you have
489.181	a better way to control light,
491.38	and when you place the mass and the walls
494.783	in the perimeter,
496.439	then you are preventing direct sun radiation.
499.872	You may also open those windows
501.792	and get cross-ventilation.
504.688	We just made those openings
507.623	of such a scale that they could work
509.715	as elevated squares,
511.728	outdoor spaces throughout
513.472	the entire height of the building.
517.135	None of this is rocket science.
518.984	You don't require sophisticated programming.
521.683	It's not about technology.
523.416	This is just archaic, 
523.416	primitive common sense,
528.838	and by using common sense,
530.806	we went from 120 kilowatts
533.787	per square meter per year,
536.127	which is the typical energy consumption
538.298	for cooling a glass tower,
540.29	to 40 kilowatts per square meter per year.
544.62	So with the right design,
546.897	sustainability is nothing but the rigorous use
549.441	of common sense.
553.174	Last case I would like 
553.174	to share is how design
556.147	can provide more comprehensive answers
558.442	against natural disasters.
560.83	You may know that Chile, in 2010,
563.895	was hit by an 8.8 Richter scale
567.7	earthquake and tsunami,
569.823	and we were called to work
571.698	in the reconstruction of the Constitución,
573.94	in the southern part of the country.
575.85	We were given 100 days, three months,
579.347	to design almost everything,
581.263	from public buildings to public space,
583.58	street grid, transportation, housing,
585.67	and mainly how to protect the city
588.424	against future tsunamis.
590.679	This was new in Chilean urban design,
593.829	and there were in the 
593.829	air a couple of alternatives.
597.202	First one:
598.454	Forbid installation on ground zero.
601.103	Thirty million dollars spent mainly
603.14	in land expropriation.
605.524	This is exactly what's being
605.524	discussed in Japan nowadays,
608.786	and if you have a disciplined population
610.833	like the Japanese, this may work,
613.173	but we know that in Chile,
614.658	this land is going to be 
614.658	occupied illegally anyhow,
618.471	so this alternative was 
618.471	unrealistic and undesirable.
622.543	Second alternative: build a big wall,
625.936	heavy infrastructure to resist
628.253	the energy of the waves.
630.195	This alternative was conveniently lobbied
632.314	by big building companies,
633.675	because it meant 42 million 
633.675	dollars in contracts,
637.882	and was also politically preferred,
640.235	because it required no land expropriation.
644.227	But Japan proved that trying to resist
646.977	the force of nature is useless.
650.29	So this alternative was irresponsible.
653.653	As in the housing process,
655.747	we had to include the community
657.624	in the way of finding a solution for this,
660.972	and we started a participatory design process.
664.145	(Video) [In Spanish] Loudspeaker:
664.145	What kind of city do you want?
666.416	Vote for Constitución.
667.958	Go to the Open House and express your options.
670.263	Participate!
672.436	Fisherman: I am a fisherman.
674.51	Twenty-five fishermen work for me.
676.619	Where should I take them? To the forest?
678.958	Man: So why can't we have a concrete defense?
682.343	Done well, of course.
684.251	Man 2: I am the history of Constitución.
686.141	And you come here to tell me
686.141	that I cannot keep on living here?
690.101	My whole family has lived here,
692.299	I raised my children here,
693.771	and my children will also 
693.771	raise their children here.
695.856	and my grandchildren 
695.856	and everyone else will.
698.364	But why are you imposing this on me?
700.89	You! You are imposing this on me!
702.767	In danger zone I am not authorized to build.
704.558	He himself is saying that.
706.145	Man 3: No, no, no, Nieves...
710.94	Alejandro Aravena: I don't know if you were able
713.228	to read the subtitles, but you can tell
715.513	from the body language
717.157	that participatory design
718.435	is not a hippie, romantic,
720.759	let's-all-dream-together-about-
720.759	the-future-of-the-city
724.01	kind of thing.
726.077	It is actually — (Applause)
729.57	It is actually not even with the families
731.97	trying to find the right answer.
735.016	It is mainly trying to identify with precision
737.829	what is the right question.
739.9	There is nothing worse than answering well
741.987	the wrong question.
744.091	So it was pretty obvious after this process
747.41	that, well, we chicken out here
750.941	and go away because it's too tense,
753.517	or we go even further in asking,
755.543	what else is bothering you?
756.938	What other problems do you have
758.691	and you want us to take 
758.691	care of now that the city
761.273	will have to be rethought from scratch?
765.595	And what they said was,
767.791	look, fine to protect the city 
767.791	against future tsunamis,
770.577	we really appreciate, but the next one 
770.577	is going to come in, what, 20 years?
775.334	But every single year, we have problems
777.427	of flooding due to rain.
780.29	In addition, we are in the middle
782.49	of the forest region of the country,
784.289	and our public space sucks.
787.109	It's poor and it's scarce.
790.9	And the origin of the city, our identity,
793.484	is not really connected to the buildings that fell,
796.37	it is connected to the river,
797.984	but the river cannot be accessed publicly,
800.798	because its shores are privately owned.
804.5	So we thought that we had
804.5	to produce a third alternative,
809.303	and our approach was 
809.303	against geographical threats,
813.847	have geographical answers.
817.467	What if, in between the city
823.6	and the sea
828.59	we have a forest,
831.768	a forest that doesn't try to resist
834.354	the energy of nature,
836.212	but dissipates it by introducing friction?
840.271	A forest that may be able to laminate the water
844.164	and prevent the flooding?
846.515	That may pay the historical debt of public space,
851.599	and that may provide, finally,
854.242	democratic access to the river.
856.66	So as a conclusion of the participatory design,
859.601	the alternative was validated politically and socially,
862.604	but there was still the problem of the cost:
868.919	So what we did was a survey
871.323	in the public investment system,
873.875	and found out that there 
873.875	were three ministries
876.19	with three projects in 
876.19	the exact same place,
879.333	not knowing of the existence 
879.333	of the other projects.
882.297	The sum of them: 52 million dollars.
886.634	So design's power of synthesis
889.31	is trying to make a more efficient use
891.426	of the scarcest resource in cities,
894.283	which is not money but coordination.
897.696	By doing so, we were able to save
900.478	four million dollars, and 
900.478	that is why the forest
903.32	is today under construction.
906.9	(Applause)
909.516	So be it the force of self construction,
913.14	the force of common sense,
916.245	or the force of nature, all these forces
919.35	need to be translated into form,
922.781	and what that form is modeling and shaping
926.447	is not cement, bricks, or wood.
929.677	It is life itself.
931.922	Design's power of synthesis
934.26	is just an attempt to put
936.68	at the innermost core of architecture
940.312	the force of life.
942.18	Thank you so much.
944.969	(Applause)
