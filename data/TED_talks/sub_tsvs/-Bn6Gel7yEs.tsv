26	First place I'd like to take you
27	is what many believe will be the world's deepest natural abyss.
31	And I say believe because this process is still ongoing.
34	Right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year
38	that I'll talk a little bit about.
40	One of the things that's changed here,
42	in the last 150 years since Jules Verne
45	had great science-fiction concepts of what the underworld was like,
48	is that technology has enabled us to go to these places
52	that were previously completely unknown and speculated about.
56	We can now descend thousands of meters into the Earth with relative impunity.
61	Along the way we've discovered fantastic abysses and chambers so large
67	that you can see for hundreds of meters
69	without a break in the line of sight.
72	When you go on a thing like this, we can usually be in the field
74	for anywhere from two to four months,
76	with a team as small as 20 or 30, to as big as 150.
81	And a lot of people ask me, you know,
85	what kind of people do you get for a project like this?
87	While our selection process
90	is not as rigorous as NASA, it's nonetheless thorough.
93	We're looking for competence, discipline, endurance, and strength.
98	In case you're wondering, this is our strength test.
100	(Laughter)
102	But we also value esprit de corps
106	and the ability to diplomatically resolve inter-personal conflict
110	while under great stress in remote locations.
114	We have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance.
118	From the entrance, this is nothing like a commercial cave.
122	You're looking at Camp Two in a place called J2, not K2, but J2.
126	We're roughly two days from the entrance at that point.
130	And it's kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse,
134	except that you're now running a string of these things down.
136	The idea is to try to provide some measure of physical comfort
140	while you're down there, otherwise in damp, moist, cold conditions in utterly dark places.
146	I should mention that everything you're seeing here, by the way,
149	is artificially illuminated at great effort.
152	Otherwise it is completely dark in these places.
154	The deeper you go, the more you run into a conflict with water.
159	It's basically like a tree collecting water coming down.
163	And eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous
167	and unfortunately slides just don't do justice.
170	So I've got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late 1980s.
175	So descend into Huautla Plateau in Mexico.
178	(Video)
182	Now I have to tell you that the techniques being shown here
185	are obsolete and dangerous.
187	We would not do this today unless we were doing it for film.
191	(Laughter)
195	Along that same line, I have to tell you
197	that with the spate of Hollywood movies that came out last year,
200	we have never seen monsters underground --
204	at least the kind that eat you.
206	If there is a monster underground,
210	it is the crushing psychological remoteness
213	that begins to hit every member of the team
215	once you cross about three days inbound from the nearest entrance.
220	Next year I'll be leading an international team to J2.
224	We're going to be shooting from minus 2,600 meters --
226	that's a little over 8,600 feet down --
229	at 30 kilometers from the entrance.
231	The lead crews will be underground for pushing 30 days straight.
235	I don't think there's been a mission like that in a long time.
238	Eventually, if you keep going down in these things,
240	probability says that you're going to run into a place like this.
243	It's a place where there's a fold in the geologic stratum
247	that collects water and fills to the roof.
249	And when you used to find these things,
252	they would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon.
255	Now I remember that term really well for two reasons.
257	Number one, it's the name of my rock band, and second,
260	is because the confrontation of these things
263	forced me to become an inventor.
265	And we've since gone on to develop
268	many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this.
271	This is some life-support equipment closed-cycle.
274	And you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally
277	underwater and to depths of 200 meters straight down underwater.
281	When you do this kind of stuff it's like doing EVA.
284	It's like doing extra-vehicular activity in space,
287	but at much greater distances, and at much greater physical peril.
291	So it makes you think about how to design your equipment
293	for long range, away from a safe haven.
296	Here's a clip from a National Geographic movie
298	that came out in 1999.
300	(Video) Narrator: Exploration is a physical process
302	of putting your foot in places where humans have never stepped before.
306	This is where the last little nugget of totally unknown territory remains on this planet.
311	To experience it is a privilege.
318	Bill Stone: That was taken in Wakulla Springs, Florida.
322	Couple of things to note about that movie. Every piece of equipment
326	that you saw in there did not exist before 1999.
328	It was developed within a two-year period and used on actual exploratory projects.
333	This gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper,
336	and it produced the first three-dimensional map anybody has ever done
340	of a cave, and it happened to be underwater in Wakulla Springs.
343	It was that gadget that serendipitously opened a door
347	to another unexplored world.
348	This is Europa.
352	Carolyn Porco mentioned another one called Enceladus the other day.
356	This is one of the places where planetary scientists
359	believe there is a highest probability of the detection
361	of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there.
365	For those who have never seen this story,
367	Jim Cameron produced a really wonderful IMAX movie
370	"couple of years ago, called ""Aliens of the Deep."""
372	There was a brief clip --
376	(Video) Narrator: A mission to explore under the ice of Europa
378	would be the ultimate robotic challenge.
384	Europa is so far away that even at the speed of light,
390	it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle.
394	It has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards
397	and to find a good landing site on the ice.
409	Now we have to get through the ice.
412	You need a melt probe.
414	It's basically a nuclear-heated torpedo.
427	The ice could be anywhere from three to 16 miles deep.
431	Week after week, the melt probe will sink of its own weight
434	through the ancient ice, until finally --
443	Now, what are you going to do when you reach the surface of that ocean?
449	You need an AUV, an autonomous underwater vehicle.
454	It needs to be one smart puppy, able to navigate
456	and make decisions on its own in an alien ocean.
461	BS: What Jim didn't know when he released that movie
463	was that six months earlier NASA had funded a team I assembled
468	to develop a prototype for the Europa AUV.
471	I mean, I cut through three years of engineering meetings, design
476	and system integration, and introduced DEPTHX --
479	Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer.
481	And as the movie says, this is one smart puppy.
484	It's got 96 sensors, 36 onboard computers,
492	packs more than 10 kilos of TNT in electrical onboard equivalent.
497	This is the target site,
499	the world's deepest hydrothermal spring at Cenote Zacaton in northern Mexico.
504	It's been explored to a depth of 292 meters
507	and beyond that nobody knows anything.
510	This is part of DEPTHX's mission.
512	There are two primary targets we're doing here.
514	One is, how do you do science autonomy underground?
516	How do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist?
520	There are more stages involved here
522	than I've got time to tell you about, but basically we drive
524	through the space, we populate it with environmental variables --
528	sulphide, halide, things like that.
530	We calculate gradient surfaces, and drive the bot over to a wall
533	where there's a high probability of life.
535	We move along the wall, in what's called proximity operations,
537	looking for changes in color.
539	If we see something that looks interesting, we pull it into a microscope.
542	If it passes the microscopic test, we go for a collection.
546	We either draw in a liquid sample,
548	or we can actually take a solid core from the wall.
551	No hands at the wheel.
552	This is all behavioral autonomy here
554	that's being conducted by the robot on its own.
557	The real hat trick for this vehicle, though,
559	is a disruptive new navigation system we've developed,
562	known as 3D SLAM, for simultaneous localization and mapping.
566	DEPTHX is an all-seeing eyeball.
568	Its sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time,
572	allowing it to do new exploration
575	while it's still achieving geometric sensor-lock
577	on what it's gone through already.
578	What I'm going to show you next
581	is the first fully autonomous robotic exploration underground
585	that's ever been done.
636	This May, we're going to go from minus 1,000 meters in Zacaton,
639	and if we're very lucky, DEPTHX will bring back the first
642	robotically-discovered division of bacteria.
645	The next step after that is to test it in Antartica and then,
648	if the funding continues and NASA has the resolution to go,
651	we could potentially launch by 2016, and by 2019
655	we may have the first evidence of life off this planet.
659	What then of manned space exploration?
664	The government recently announced plans to return to the moon by 2024.
668	The successful conclusion of that mission will result
671	in infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number
675	of government scientists and pilots.
677	It will leave us no further along in the general expansion
681	of humanity into space than we were 50 years ago.
684	Something fundamental has to change
686	if we are to see common access to space in our lifetime.
689	What I'm going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas.
693	And I hope you'll bear with me and have some faith
695	that there's credibility behind what we're going to say here.
699	There are three underpinnings of working in space privately.
706	One of them is the requirement
708	for economical earth-to-space transport.
711	The Bert Rutans and Richard Bransons of this world
714	have got this in their sights and I salute them.
716	Go, go, go.
718	The next thing we need are places to stay on orbit.
721	Orbital hotels to start with, but workshops for the rest of us later on.
724	The final missing piece, the real paradigm-buster, is this:
730	a gas station on orbit.
733	It's not going to look like that.
735	If it existed, it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning.
741	Now, to give you a chance to understand
744	why there is power in that statement,
747	I've got to give you the basics of Space 101.
749	And the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram.
757	Anybody drink one of these here this week?
760	You'd pay 10,000 dollars for that in orbit.
764	That's more than you pay for TED,
766	if Google dropped their sponsorship.
768	(Laughter)
771	The second is more than 90 percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant.
776	Thus, every time you'd want to do anything in space,
780	you are literally blowing away enormous sums of money
784	every time you hit the accelerator.
786	Not even the guys at Tesla can fight that physics.
789	So, what if you could get your gas at a 10th the price?
795	There is a place where you can.
798	In fact, you can get it better -- you can get it at 14 times lower
801	if you can find propellant on the moon.
804	There is a little-known mission that was launched
806	by the Pentagon, 13 years ago now, called Clementine.
810	And the most amazing thing that came out of that mission
813	was a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater
816	on the south pole of the moon.
818	That signal was so strong,
820	it could only have been produced by 10 trillion tons of water
824	buried in the sediment, collected over millions and billions of years
828	by the impact of asteroids and comet material.
835	If we're going to get that, and make that gas station possible,
839	we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space.
842	We can't do that right now.
844	The way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack
847	that has to be launched from the ground,
849	and resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces.
851	We have to beat that.
853	We can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics.
856	We can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything.
860	This is an idea that, again, came out of Livermore back in 1989,
864	with Dr. Lowell Wood's group.
866	And we can extend that now to just about everything.
870	Bob Bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit.
872	We can go much further.
873	We can build space tugs, orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water.
878	There's another thing.
880	When you're coming back from the moon,
882	you have to deal with orbital mechanics.
884	It says you're moving 10,000 feet per second faster
886	than you really want to be to get back to your gas station.
889	You got two choices.
891	You can burn rocket fuel to get there, or you can do something really incredible.
895	You can dive into the stratosphere,
897	and precisely dissipate that velocity, and come back out to the space station.
901	It has never been done.
902	It's risky and it's going to be one hell of a ride --
906	better than Disney.
908	The traditional approach to space exploration
910	has been that you carry all the fuel you need
912	to get everybody back in case of an emergency.
914	If you try to do that for the moon,
916	you're going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there.
920	But if you send a mining team there,
922	without the return propellant, first --
924	(Laughter)
929	Did any of you guys hear the story of Cortez?
933	This is not like that. I'm much more like Scotty.
935	I like this equipment, you know, and I really value it
938	so we're not going to burn the gear.
940	But, if you were truly bold you could get it there, manufacture it,
944	and it would be the most dramatic demonstration
946	that you could do something worthwhile off this planet
948	that has ever been done.
950	There's a myth that you can't do anything in space
953	for less than a trillion dollars and 20 years.
957	That's not true.
958	In seven years, we could pull off
960	an industrial mission to Shackleton and demonstrate
962	that you could provide commercial reality out of this in low-earth orbit.
967	We're living in one of the most exciting times in history.
970	We're at a magical confluence where private wealth
972	and imagination are driving the demand for access to space.
976	The orbital refueling stations I've just described
979	could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key
982	for opening space to the general exploration.
986	To bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed.
990	We can do it by jump-starting with an industrial
992	Lewis and Clark expedition to Shackleton crater,
995	to mine the moon for resources, and demonstrate
997	they can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit.
1001	Talk about space always seems to be hung on ambiguities
1004	of purpose and timing.
1006	I would like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at TED.
1011	I intend to lead that expedition.
1013	(Applause)
1021	It can be done in seven years with the right backing.
1024	Those who join me in making it happen will become a part of history
1028	and join other bold individuals from time past
1030	who, had they been here today, would have heartily approved.
1035	There was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier.
1040	We have collectively forgotten that lesson.
1045	Now we're at a time when boldness is required to move forward.
1055	I intend to plant an industrial flag on the moon
1057	and complete the final piece
1060	that will open the space frontier, in our time, for all of us.
1064	Thank you.
1065	(Applause)
