12.627	So, we used to solve big problems.
17.263	On July 21st, 1969,
20.783	Buzz Aldrin climbed out of Apollo 11's lunar module
24.37	and descended onto the Sea of Tranquility.
27.927	Armstrong and Aldrin were alone,
30.657	but their presence on the moon's gray surface
32.943	was the culmination of a convulsive, collective effort.
38.074	The Apollo program was the greatest
40.118	peacetime mobilization
41.855	in the history of the United States.
43.793	To get to the moon, NASA spent
45.289	around 180 billion dollars in today's money,
49.028	or four percent of the federal budget.
51.564	Apollo employed around 400,000 people
54.868	and demanded the collaboration of 20,000
57.706	companies, universities and government agencies.
61.402	People died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
65.346	But before the Apollo program ended,
71.176	Twelve walked on its surface, of whom Aldrin,
74.25	following the death of Armstrong last year,
76.603	is now the most senior.
78.689	So why did they go?
80.674	They didn't bring much back:
85.25	and something all 24 later emphasized --
89.705	a new sense of the smallness
92.567	and the fragility of our common home.
95.51	Why did they go? The cynical answer is they went
98.59	because President Kennedy wanted to show
100.566	the Soviets that his nation had the better rockets.
104.673	But Kennedy's own words at Rice University in 1962
109.145	provide a better clue.
111.043	(Video) John F. Kennedy: But why, some say, the moon?
113.566	Why choose this as our goal?
116.51	And they may well ask,
118.433	why climb the highest mountain?
121.012	Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic?
125.028	Why does Rice play Texas?
127.212	We choose to go to the moon.
129.823	We choose to go to the moon.
132.4	(Applause)
137.67	We choose to go to the moon in this decade,
140.584	and do the other things,
142.231	not because they are easy, but because they are hard.
146.56	Jason Pontin: To contemporaries,
148.73	Apollo wasn't only a victory of West over East
151.983	in the Cold War.
153.198	At the time, the strongest emotion
155.203	was of wonder
156.928	at the transcendent powers of technology.
160.527	They went because it was a big thing to do.
165.946	Landing on the moon occurred in the context
168.466	of a long series of technological triumphs.
171.631	The first half of the 20th century produced
174.144	the assembly line and the airplane,
176.28	penicillin and a vaccine for tuberculosis.
179.554	In the middle years of the century,
180.856	polio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated.
184.548	Technology itself seemed to possess
186.545	what Alvin Toffler in 1970
189.129	"called ""accelerative thrust."""
191.963	For most of human history,
193.807	we could go no faster than a horse
196.095	or a boat with a sail,
198.196	but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10
200.597	flew at 25,000 miles an hour.
204.48	Since 1970, no human beings
207.38	have been back to the moon.
209.262	No one has traveled faster than the crew
211.481	of Apollo 10,
213.087	and blithe optimism about technology's powers
216.859	has evaporated
218.761	as big problems we had imagined technology would solve,
222.332	such as going to Mars,
224.635	creating clean energy, curing cancer,
227.966	or feeding the world have come to seem
230.775	intractably hard.
233.464	I remember watching the liftoff of Apollo 17.
237.173	I was five years old,
239.222	and my mother told me not to stare
241.59	at the fiery exhaust of a Saturn V rocket.
244.725	I vaguely knew this was to be the last
247.166	of the moon missions,
248.704	but I was absolutely certain there would be
252.47	Mars colonies in my lifetime.
255.78	"So ""Something happened"
258.343	"to our capacity to solve big problems with technology"""
262.526	has become a commonplace.
264.918	You hear it all the time.
266.308	We've heard it over the last two days here at TED.
269.72	It feels as if technologists have diverted us
273.688	and enriched themselves with trivial toys,
276.373	with things like iPhones and apps and social media,
279.878	or algorithms that speed automated trading.
283.497	There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
285.891	They've expanded and enriched our lives.
288.972	But they don't solve humanity's big problems.
293.673	What happened?
294.886	So there is a parochial explanation in Silicon Valley,
299.8	which admits that it has been funding less ambitious companies
303.245	than it did in the years when it financed
305.547	Intel, Microsoft, Apple and Genentech.
308.705	Silicon Valley says the markets are to blame,
311.265	in particular the incentives that venture capitalists
314.182	offer to entrepreneurs.
315.762	Silicon Valley says that venture investing
317.878	shifted away from funding transformational ideas
321.741	and towards funding incremental problems
324.68	or even fake problems.
326.728	But I don't think that explanation is good enough.
329.479	It mostly explains what's wrong with Silicon Valley.
333.363	Even when venture capitalists were at their most
336.013	risk-happy, they preferred small investments,
338.852	tiny investments that offered an exit within 10 years.
342.716	V.C.s have always struggled
345.035	to invest profitably in technologies such as energy
348.11	whose capital requirements are huge
350.304	and whose development is long and lengthy,
353.012	and V.C.s have never, never funded the development
356.169	of technologies meant to solve big problems
359.167	that possess no immediate commercial value.
361.861	No, the reasons we can't solve big problems
364.073	are more complicated and more profound.
368.155	Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems.
371.142	We could go to Mars if we want.
373.56	NASA even has the outline of a plan.
376.427	But going to Mars would follow a political decision
379.916	with popular appeal, and that will never happen.
383.27	We won't go to Mars, because everyone thinks
386.012	there are more important things
387.961	to do here on Earth.
390.248	Sometimes, we can't solve big problems
393.292	because our political systems fail.
395.796	Today, less than two percent
397.894	of the world's energy consumption
399.581	derives from advanced, renewable sources
401.747	such as solar, wind and biofuels,
404.625	less than two percent,
406.207	and the reason is purely economic.
408.311	Coal and natural gas are cheaper
410.504	than solar and wind,
412.249	and petroleum is cheaper than biofuels.
414.768	We want alternative energy sources
417.449	that can compete on price. None exist.
420.45	Now, technologists, business leaders
423.155	and economists all basically agree
425.651	on what national policies and international treaties
429.152	would spur the development of alternative energy:
432.436	mostly, a significant increase in energy
435.151	research and development,
436.568	and some kind of price on carbon.
439.363	But there's no hope in the present political climate
442.567	that we will see U.S. energy policy
444.96	or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
449.727	Sometimes, big problems that had seemed technological
454.211	turn out not to be so.
456.11	Famines were long understood to be caused
459.328	by failures in food supply.
461.736	But 30 years of research have taught us
463.991	that famines are political crises
466.659	that catastrophically affect food distribution.
470.173	Technology can improve things like crop yields
473.136	or systems for storing and transporting food,
477.379	but there will be famines so long as there are bad governments.
482.624	Finally, big problems sometimes elude solution
486.139	because we don't really understand the problem.
489.605	President Nixon declared war on cancer in 1971,
494.549	but we soon discovered
495.962	there are many kinds of cancer,
498.495	most of them fiendishly resistant to therapy,
502.061	and it is only in the last 10 years
504.271	that effective, viable therapies
506.818	have come to seem real.
508.875	Hard problems are hard.
511.925	It's not true that we can't solve big problems through technology.
516.407	We can, we must, but these four elements
520.123	must all be present:
521.878	Political leaders and the public
523.822	must care to solve a problem;
525.564	institutions must support its solution;
528.735	It must really be a technological problem;
531.81	and we must understand it.
535.661	The Apollo mission,
537.108	which has become a kind of metaphor
539.845	for technology's capacity to solve big problems,
543.029	met these criteria.
545.24	But it is an irreproducible model for the future.
548.667	It is not 1961.
550.491	There is no galvanizing contest like the Cold War,
554.582	no politician like John Kennedy
556.941	who can heroize the difficult and the dangerous,
560.132	and no popular science fictional mythology
563.477	such as exploring the solar system.
566.583	Most of all, going to the moon
568.985	turned out to be easy.
570.847	It was just three days away.
572.895	And arguably it wasn't even solving
575.78	much of a problem.
578.384	We are left alone with our day,
582.464	and the solutions of the future will be harder won.
587.941	God knows, we don't lack for the challenges.
590.726	Thank you very much.
591.88	(Applause)
