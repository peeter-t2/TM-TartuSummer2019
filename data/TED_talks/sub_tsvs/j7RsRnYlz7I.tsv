12.572	A couple of years ago,
14.023	Harvard Business School chose
16.241	the best business model of that year.
18.99	It chose Somali piracy.
23.054	Pretty much around the same time,
25.27	I discovered that there were 544 seafarers
31.103	being held hostage on ships,
34.489	often anchored just off the Somali coast
36.579	in plain sight.
39.007	And I learned these two facts, and I thought,
41.632	what's going on in shipping?
44.073	And I thought, would that happen
44.073	in any other industry?
46.644	Would we see 544 airline pilots
50.155	held captive in their jumbo jets
51.785	on a runway for months, or a year?
55.272	Would we see 544 Greyhound bus drivers?
59.098	It wouldn't happen.
60.977	So I started to get intrigued.
63.755	And I discovered another fact,
66.269	which to me was more astonishing
68.252	almost for the fact that I hadn't known it before
71.337	at the age of 42, 43.
73.996	That is how fundamentally 
73.996	we still depend on shipping.
79.315	Because perhaps the general public
81.66	thinks of shipping as an old-fashioned industry,
84.785	something brought by sailboat
87.323	with Moby Dicks and Jack Sparrows.
90.708	But shipping isn't that.
92.602	Shipping is as crucial to us as it has ever been.
97.479	Shipping brings us 90 percent of world trade.
102.082	Shipping has quadrupled in size since 1970.
106.647	We are more dependent on it now than ever.
109.639	And yet, for such an enormous industry --
113.398	there are a 100,000 working vessels on the sea —
116.875	it's become pretty much invisible.
120.268	Now that sounds absurd in Singapore to say that,
124.557	because here shipping is so present
126.903	that you stuck a ship on top of a hotel.
130.285	(Laughter)
131.965	But elsewhere in the world,
133.981	if you ask the general public what they know
136.227	about shipping and how much
136.227	trade is carried by sea,
139.063	you will get essentially a blank face.
143.68	You will ask someone on the street
145.713	if they've heard of Microsoft.
147.436	I should think they'll say yes,
149.273	because they'll know that they make software
151.468	that goes on computers,
153.363	and occasionally works.
156.508	But if you ask them if they've heard of Maersk,
160.113	I doubt you'd get the same response,
162.814	even though Maersk,
164.261	which is just one shipping company amongst many,
167.952	has revenues pretty much on a par with Microsoft.
170.934	[$60.2 billion]
172.415	Now why is this?
174.338	A few years ago,
176.251	the first sea lord of the British admiralty --
179.523	he is called the first sea lord,
181.328	although the chief of the army is not called a land lord —
185.823	he said that we, and he meant
188.266	in the industrialized nations in the West,
190.948	that we suffer from sea blindness.
194.76	We are blind to the sea
196.404	as a place of industry or of work.
199.33	It's just something we fly over,
201.623	a patch of blue on an airline map.
204.628	Nothing to see, move along.
207.953	So I wanted to open my own eyes
211.598	to my own sea blindness,
214.675	so I ran away to sea.
218.045	A couple of years ago, I took a passage
220.396	on the Maersk Kendal,
222.77	a mid-sized container ship
224.112	carrying nearly 7,000 boxes,
227.34	and I departed from Felixstowe,
229.237	on the south coast of England,
231	and I ended up right here in Singapore
233.161	five weeks later,
234.654	considerably less jet-lagged than I am right now.
239.558	And it was a revelation.
242.8	We traveled through five seas,
244.995	two oceans, nine ports,
247.542	and I learned a lot about shipping.
250.289	And one of the first things that surprised me
252.007	when I got on board Kendal
254.394	was, where are all the people?
257.139	I have friends in the Navy who tell me
258.759	they sail with 1,000 sailors at a time,
261.898	but on Kendal there were only 21 crew.
265.237	Now that's because shipping is very efficient.
268.114	Containerization has made it very efficient.
271.178	Ships have automation now.
273.272	They can operate with small crews.
276.001	But it also means that, in the words
277.79	of a port chaplain I once met,
280.25	the average seafarer you're going to find
282.295	on a container ship is either tired or exhausted,
286.434	because the pace of modern shipping
289.213	is quite punishing for what the shipping calls
291.534	its human element,
293.965	a strange phrase which they don't seem to realize
296.417	sounds a little bit inhuman.
298.821	So most seafarers now working on container ships
301.496	often have less than two hours in port at a time.
305.573	They don't have time to relax.
307.211	They're at sea for months at a time,
309.455	and even when they're on board,
310.77	they don't have access to what
312.072	a five-year-old would take for granted, the Internet.
316.506	And another thing that surprised me
316.506	when I got on board Kendal
319.335	was who I was sitting next to --
322.327	Not the queen; I can't imagine why
322.327	they put me underneath her portrait --
327.576	But around that dining table in the officer's saloon,
330.345	I was sitting next to a Burmese guy,
332.173	I was opposite a Romanian, a Moldavian, an Indian.
335.438	On the next table was a Chinese guy,
337.675	and in the crew room, it was entirely Filipinos.
340.717	So that was a normal working ship.
343.677	Now how is that possible?
345.7	Because the biggest dramatic change
347.592	in shipping over the last 60 years,
349.436	when most of the general public stopped noticing it,
351.948	was something called an open registry,
354.567	or a flag of convenience.
357.372	Ships can now fly the flag of any nation
359.959	that provides a flag registry.
362.911	You can get a flag from the landlocked nation
365.186	of Bolivia, or Mongolia,
367.31	or North Korea, though that's not very popular.
370.285	(Laughter)
371.708	So we have these very multinational,
373.819	global, mobile crews on ships.
378.6	And that was a surprise to me.
381.312	And when we got to pirate waters,
384.429	down the Bab-el-Mandeb strait
384.429	and into the Indian Ocean,
387.555	the ship changed.
389.307	And that was also shocking, because suddenly,
392.45	I realized, as the captain said to me,
394.664	that I had been crazy to choose to go
396.666	through pirate waters on a container ship.
399.718	We were no longer allowed on deck.
401.709	There were double pirate watches.
404.305	And at that time, there were those 
408.582	and some of them were held hostage for years
410.55	because of the nature of shipping
410.55	and the flag of convenience.
413.321	Not all of them, but some of them were,
415.403	because for the minority
415.403	of unscrupulous ship owners,
420.117	it can be easy to hide behind
422.662	the anonymity offered by some flags of convenience.
427.661	What else does our sea blindness mask?
431.6	Well, if you go out to sea on a ship
433.919	or on a cruise ship, and look up to the funnel,
435.914	you'll see very black smoke.
438.783	And that's because shipping
441.318	has very tight margins,
441.318	and they want cheap fuel,
443.905	so they use something called bunker fuel,
446.076	which was described to me
446.076	by someone in the tanker industry
448.592	as the dregs of the refinery,
450.758	or just one step up from asphalt.
454.015	And shipping is the greenest method of transport.
457.412	In terms of carbon emissions per ton per mile,
459.755	it emits about a thousandth of aviation
462.726	and about a tenth of trucking.
464.841	But it's not benign, because there's so much of it.
468.077	So shipping emissions are
468.077	about three to four percent,
470.607	almost the same as aviation's.
472.782	And if you put shipping emissions
474.171	on a list of the countries' carbon emissions,
477.551	it would come in about sixth,
479.164	somewhere near Germany.
481.278	It was calculated in 2009 that the 15 largest ships
485.296	pollute in terms of particles and soot
487.891	and noxious gases
489.291	as much as all the cars in the world.
491.869	And the good news is that
493.269	people are now talking about sustainable shipping.
495.464	There are interesting initiatives going on.
497.951	But why has it taken so long?
500.206	When are we going to start talking and thinking
502.553	about shipping miles as well as air miles?
506.589	I also traveled to Cape Cod to look
509.394	at the plight of the North Atlantic right whale,
513.321	because this to me was one
513.321	of the most surprising things
515.477	about my time at sea,
517.433	and what it made me think about.
519.23	We know about man's impact on the ocean
522.383	in terms of fishing and overfishing,
524.815	but we don't really know much about
526.623	what's happening underneath the water.
528.806	And in fact, shipping has a role to play here,
531.411	because shipping noise has contributed
535.057	to damaging the acoustic
535.057	habitats of ocean creatures.
538.25	Light doesn't penetrate beneath
538.25	the surface of the water,
541.242	so ocean creatures like whales and dolphins
543.869	and even 800 species of fish
546.173	communicate by sound.
549.064	And a North Atlantic right whale
550.777	can transmit across hundreds of miles.
553.984	A humpback can transmit a sound
555.947	across a whole ocean.
557.885	But a supertanker can also be heard
559.84	coming across a whole ocean,
561.911	and because the noise that
561.911	propellers make underwater
564.475	is sometimes at the same frequency that whales use,
567.812	then it can damage their acoustic habitat,
570.846	and they need this for breeding,
572.536	for finding feeding grounds,
574.187	for finding mates.
576.71	And the acoustic habitat of the
576.71	North Atlantic right whale
579.551	has been reduced by up to 90 percent.
582.901	But there are no laws governing 
582.901	acoustic pollution yet.
587.513	And when I arrived in Singapore,
590.769	and I apologize for this, but I 
590.769	didn't want to get off my ship.
595.676	I'd really loved being on board Kendal.
598.635	I'd been well treated by the crew,
600.53	I'd had a garrulous and entertaining captain,
604.071	and I would happily have signed up
604.071	for another five weeks,
608.143	something that the captain also said
609.974	I was crazy to think about.
612.247	But I wasn't there for nine months at a time
614.491	like the Filipino seafarers,
616.446	who, when I asked them to describe their job to me,
618.685	"called it ""dollar for homesickness."""
621.007	They had good salaries,
622.485	but theirs is still an isolating and difficult life
625.516	in a dangerous and often difficult element.
629.205	But when I get to this part, I'm in two minds,
631.291	because I want to salute those seafarers
634.216	who bring us 90 percent of everything
636.403	and get very little thanks or recognition for it.
640.069	I want to salute the 100,000 ships
642.79	that are at sea
644.113	that are doing that work, coming in and out
646.646	every day, bringing us what we need.
649.875	But I also want to see shipping,
652.895	and us, the general public,
652.895	who know so little about it,
656.374	to have a bit more scrutiny,
658.414	to be a bit more transparent,
660.518	to have 90 percent transparency.
663.79	Because I think we could all benefit
666.691	from doing something very simple,
668.796	which is learning to see the sea.
671.878	Thank you.
674.036	(Applause)
