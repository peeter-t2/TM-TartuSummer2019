15.728	As a magician, I try to create images
15.728	that make people stop and think.
21.26	I also try to challenge myself
23.26	to do things that doctors
23.26	say are not possible.
27.862	I was buried alive
27.862	in New York City in a coffin,
32.26	buried alive in a coffin
32.26	in April, 1999, for a week.
37.883	I lived there with nothing but water.
41.422	And it ended up being so much fun
44.26	that I decided I could pursue
44.26	doing more of these things.
48.26	The next one is I froze myself
48.26	in a block of ice
51.716	for three days and three nights
51.716	in New York City.
54.26	That one was way more difficult
54.26	than I had expected.
59.26	The one after that, I stood
59.26	on top of a hundred-foot pillar
62.26	for 36 hours.
64.26	I began to hallucinate so hard
66.783	that the buildings that were behind me
66.783	started to look like big animal heads.
71.462	So, next I went to London.
73.26	In London I lived
73.26	in a glass box for 44 days
77.26	with nothing but water.
79.26	It was, for me, one of the most difficult
79.26	things I'd ever done,
82.284	but it was also the most beautiful.
86.26	There was so many skeptics,
86.26	especially the press in London,
89.26	that they started flying cheeseburgers
89.26	on helicopters around my box to tempt me.
95.26	(Laughter)
96.315	So, I felt very validated
99.26	when the New England Journal of Medicine
99.26	actually used the research for science.
105.68	My next pursuit was I wanted to see
105.68	how long I could go without breathing,
109.26	like how long I could survive
109.26	with nothing, not even air.
113.65	I didn't realize that it would become
113.65	the most amazing journey of my life.
120.26	As a young magician,
122.26	I was obsessed with Houdini
122.26	and his underwater challenges.
126.26	So, I began, early on,
126.26	competing against the other kids,
129.26	seeing how long I could stay underwater
129.26	while they went up and down to breathe,
133.26	you know, five times,
133.26	while I stayed under on one breath.
136.26	By the time I was a teenager,
138.26	I was able to hold my breath
138.26	for three minutes and 30 seconds.
141.968	I would later find out
141.968	that was Houdini's personal record.
147.26	In 1987 I heard of a story
150.26	about a boy that fell through ice
150.26	and was trapped under a river.
156.09	He was underneath,
156.09	not breathing for 45 minutes.
161.26	When the rescue workers came,
163.26	they resuscitated him
163.26	and there was no brain damage.
166.26	His core temperature
166.26	had dropped to 77 degrees.
171.486	As a magician,
171.486	I think everything is possible.
174.26	And I think if something
174.26	is done by one person,
176.475	it can be done by others.
178.988	I started to think,
180.394	if the boy could survive
180.394	without breathing for that long,
184.126	there must be a way that I could do it.
186.85	So, I met with a top neurosurgeon.
189.26	And I asked him, how long
189.26	is it possible to go without breathing,
192.498	like how long could I go without air?
194.902	And he said to me that anything
194.902	over six minutes
197.26	you have a serious risk
197.26	of hypoxic brain damage.
203.319	So, I took that as a challenge, basically.
206.134	(Laughter)
207.26	My first try, I figured
207.26	that I could do something similar,
213.855	and I created a water tank,
216.26	and I filled it with ice
216.26	and freezing cold water.
219.828	And I stayed inside of that water tank
222.26	hoping my core temperature
222.26	would start to drop.
225.26	And I was shivering.
226.687	In my first attempt to hold my breath,
226.687	I couldn't even last a minute.
230.204	So, I realized that was completely
230.204	not going to work.
233.983	I went to talk to a doctor friend --
238.919	"and I asked him, ""How could I do that?"""
243.26	"""I want to hold my breath for a really"
243.26	"long time. How could it be done?"""
246.713	"And he said, ""David, you're a magician,"
249.26	create the illusion of not breathing,
249.26	"it will be much easier."""
252.26	(Laughter)
256.073	So, he came up with this idea
256.073	of creating a rebreather,
260.26	with a CO2 scrubber,
262.905	which was basically
262.905	a tube from Home Depot,
267.26	with a balloon duct-taped to it,
270.26	that he thought we could put inside of me,
273.26	and somehow be able to circulate
273.26	the air and rebreathe
277.26	with this thing in me.
279.778	This is a little hard to watch.
283.26	But this is that attempt.
292.26	So, that clearly wasn't going to work.
294.26	(Laughter)
298.26	Then I actually started thinking
298.26	about liquid breathing.
302.26	There is a chemical
302.26	that's called perflubron.
305.26	And it's so high in oxygen levels
305.26	that in theory you could breathe it.
309.26	So, I got my hands on that chemical,
312.26	filled the sink up with it,
312.26	and stuck my face in the sink
315.26	and tried to breathe that in,
315.26	which was really impossible.
319.26	It's basically like trying
319.26	to breathe, as a doctor said,
322.26	while having an elephant
322.26	standing on your chest.
324.57	So, that idea disappeared.
326.727	Then I started thinking,
328.997	would it be possible to hook up
328.997	a heart/lung bypass machine
333.26	and have a surgery where it was
333.26	a tube going into my artery,
336.26	and then appear to not breathe
336.26	while they were oxygenating my blood?
340.582	Which was another insane idea, obviously.
344.89	Then I thought about
344.89	the craziest idea of all the ideas:
349.787	to actually do it.
351.26	(Laughter)
352.331	To actually try to hold
352.331	my breath past the point
355.767	that doctors would
355.767	consider you brain dead.
361.028	So, I started researching
361.028	into pearl divers.
365.26	You know, because they go down
365.26	for four minutes on one breath.
368.26	And when I was researching pearl divers,
368.26	I found the world of free-diving.
372.788	It was the most amazing thing
372.788	that I ever discovered, pretty much.
377.856	There is many different
377.856	aspects to free-diving.
380.26	There is depth records,
380.26	where people go as deep as they can.
383.808	And then there is static apnea.
385.732	That's holding your breath
385.732	as long as you can
388.26	in one place without moving.
390.26	That was the one that I studied.
392.26	The first thing that I learned
392.26	is when you're holding your breath,
395.38	you should never move at all;
395.38	that wastes energy.
398.26	And that depletes oxygen,
400.923	and it builds up CO2 in your blood.
402.786	So, I learned never to move.
404.678	And I learned how to slow
404.678	my heart rate down.
407.26	I had to remain
407.26	perfectly still and just relax
409.475	and think that I wasn't in my body,
409.475	and just control that.
413.26	And then I learned how to purge.
415.26	Purging is basically hyperventilating.
417.737	You blow in and out --
418.953	(Breathing loudly)
423.26	You do that, you get lightheaded,
423.26	you get tingling.
426.261	And you're really ridding
426.261	your body of CO2.
428.59	So, when you hold your breath,
428.59	it's infinitely easier.
432.676	Then I learned that you have
432.676	to take a huge breath,
436.412	and just hold and relax
436.412	and never let any air out,
440.26	and just hold and relax
440.26	through all the pain.
443.26	Every morning, this is for months,
445.849	I would wake up
445.849	and the first thing that I would do
448.713	is I would hold my breath
451.086	for, out of 52 minutes,
451.086	I would hold my breath for 44 minutes.
456.26	So, basically what that means
456.26	is I would purge,
458.475	I'd breathe really hard for a minute.
460.36	And I would hold, immediately after,
460.36	for five and a half minutes.
463.653	Then I would breathe again for a minute,
463.653	purging as hard as I can,
467.26	then immediately after that I would hold
467.26	again for five and a half minutes.
470.861	I would repeat this process
470.861	eight times in a row.
473.796	Out of 52 minutes, you're only
473.796	breathing for eight minutes.
477.26	At the end of that
477.26	you're completely fried, your brain.
480.26	You feel like you're walking
480.26	around in a daze.
482.475	And you have these awful headaches.
484.26	Basically, I'm not the best person
484.26	to talk to when I'm doing that stuff.
488.26	I started learning
488.26	about the world-record holder.
490.618	His name is Tom Sietas.
492.26	And this guy is perfectly built
492.26	for holding his breath.
496.26	He's six foot four. He's 160 pounds.
500.26	And his total lung capacity
500.26	is twice the size of an average person.
505.26	I'm six foot one, and fat.
508.837	We'll say big-boned.
510.26	(Laughter)
512.26	I had to drop 50 pounds in three months.
516.26	So, everything that I put into my body,
516.26	I considered as medicine.
520.794	Every bit of food was exactly
520.794	what it was for its nutritional value.
525.26	I ate really small controlled portions
525.26	throughout the day.
529.26	And I started to really adapt my body.
533.481	[Individual results may vary]
535.647	(Laughter)
538.26	The thinner I was, the longer
538.26	I was able to hold my breath.
541.909	And by eating so well
541.909	and training so hard,
545.26	my resting heart-rate dropped
545.26	to 38 beats per minute.
548.784	Which is lower than most Olympic athletes.
552.301	In four months of training,
553.875	I was able to hold my breath
553.875	for over seven minutes.
557.58	I wanted to try holding
557.58	my breath everywhere.
560.26	I wanted to try it
560.26	in the most extreme situations
562.618	to see if I could slow
562.618	my heart rate down under duress.
566.937	(Laughter)
570.26	I decided that I was going
570.26	to break the world record
573.26	live on prime-time television.
575.861	The world record was
575.861	eight minutes and 58 seconds,
579.26	held by Tom Sietas, that guy
579.26	with the whale lungs I told you about.
584.26	I assumed that I could put
584.26	a water tank at Lincoln Center
587.697	and if I stayed there a week not eating,
591.26	I would get comfortable in that situation
591.26	and I would slow my metabolism,
595.26	which I was sure would help me
595.26	hold my breath
597.427	longer than I had been able to do it.
600.022	I was completely wrong.
602.696	I entered the sphere a week
602.696	before the scheduled air date.
606.667	And I thought everything
606.667	seemed to be on track.
610.26	Two days before my big
610.26	breath-hold attempt, for the record,
614.26	the producers of my television special
616.26	thought that just watching somebody
616.26	holding their breath, and almost drowning,
622.15	is too boring for television.
624.26	(Laughter)
626.26	So, I had to add handcuffs,
626.26	while holding my breath, to escape from.
631.668	This was a critical mistake.
634.668	Because of the movement,
634.668	I was wasting oxygen.
638.26	And by seven minutes I had gone
638.26	into these awful convulsions.
644.26	By 7:08, I started to black out.
649.26	And by seven minutes and 30 seconds,
652.26	they had to pull my body out
652.26	and bring me back.
660.26	I had failed on every level.
662.26	(Laughter)
664.26	So, naturally, the only way out
664.26	of the slump that I could think of was,
670.219	I decided to call Oprah.
672.706	(Laughter)
676.26	I told her that I wanted to up the ante
678.26	and hold my breath longer
678.26	than any human being ever had.
682.26	This was a different record.
684.042	This was a pure O2 static apnea record
686.576	that Guinness had set
686.576	the world record at 13 minutes.
691.528	So, basically you breathe pure O2 first,
691.528	oxygenating your body, flushing out CO2,
697.095	and you are able to hold much longer.
700.818	I realized that my real competition
700.818	was the beaver.
705.268	(Laughter)
711.235	(Laughter ends)
712.26	In January of '08,
714.26	Oprah gave me four months
714.26	to prepare and train.
717.925	So, I would sleep
717.925	in a hypoxic tent every night.
720.917	A hypoxic tent is a tent
720.917	that simulates altitude at 15,000 feet.
725.26	So, it's like base camp, Everest.
727.957	What that does is, you start building up
727.957	the red bloodcell count in your body,
733.26	which helps you carry oxygen better.
736.521	Every morning, again,
736.521	after getting out of that tent,
740.26	your brain is completely wiped out.
743.26	My first attempt on pure O2,
743.26	I was able to go up to 15 minutes.
747.899	So, it was a pretty big success.
750.26	The neurosurgeon
750.26	pulled me out of the water
752.332	because in his mind, at 15 minutes
752.332	your brain is done, you're brain dead.
757.26	So, he pulled me up, and I was fine.
760.863	There was one person there
760.863	that was definitely not impressed.
765.022	It was my ex-girlfriend.
766.67	While I was breaking the record
766.67	underwater for the first time,
770.154	she was sifting through my Blackberry,
770.154	checking all my messages.
773.26	(Laughter)
776.26	My brother had a picture of it.
776.26	It is really --
778.803	(Laughter)
782.707	(Laughter ends)
783.732	I then announced that I was going
783.732	to go for Sietas' record, publicly.
788.26	And what he did in response,
788.26	is he went on Regis and Kelly,
793.26	and broke his old record.
795.261	Then his main competitor
795.261	went out and broke his record.
799.561	So, he suddenly pushed the record up to
804.26	Which was three minutes
804.26	longer than I had prepared.
807.137	It was longer than the record.
810.26	I wanted to get the Science Times
810.26	to document this.
814.26	I wanted to get them to do a piece on it.
816.838	So, I did what any person
820.26	seriously pursuing scientific
820.26	advancement would do.
823.973	I walked into the New York Times offices
823.973	and did card tricks to everybody.
828.26	(Laughter)
832.26	So, I don't know if it was the magic
832.26	or the lure of the Cayman Islands,
835.665	but John Tierney flew down
837.26	and did a piece on the seriousness
837.26	of breath-holding.
840.26	While he was there,
840.26	I tried to impress him, of course.
842.808	And I did a dive down to 160 feet,
845.26	which is basically the height
845.26	of a 16 story building,
849.77	and as I was coming up,
849.77	I blacked out underwater,
852.26	which is really dangerous;
852.26	that's how you drown.
854.57	Luckily, Kirk had seen me
854.57	and he swam over and pulled me up.
858.948	So, I started full focus.
861.26	I completely trained to get
861.26	my breath-hold time up
864.26	for what I needed to do.
866.26	But there was no way to prepare
866.26	for the live television aspect of it,
869.57	being on Oprah.
871.26	But in practice, I would do it
871.26	face down, floating on the pool.
875.933	But for TV they wanted me to be upright
875.933	so they could see my face, basically.
882.386	The other problem
882.386	was the suit was so buoyant
886.26	that they had to strap my feet in
886.26	to keep me from floating up.
889.26	So, I had to use my legs to hold my feet
889.26	into the straps that were loose,
893.26	which was a real problem for me.
896.331	That made me extremely nervous,
896.331	raising the heart rate.
900.26	Then, what they also did was,
902.26	which we never did before,
902.26	is there was a heart-rate monitor.
905.703	And it was right next to the sphere.
908.26	So, every time my heart would beat,
908.26	I'd hear the beep-beep-beep-beep,
911.523	you know, the ticking, really loud.
913.569	Which was making me more nervous.
915.737	And there was no way to slow
915.737	my heart rate down.
920.464	Normally, I would start
920.464	at 38 beats per minute,
924.26	and while holding my breath,
924.26	it would drop to 12 beats per minute,
927.38	which is pretty unusual.
929.26	(Laughter)
935.626	This time it started at 120 beats,
935.626	and it never went down.
941.618	I spent the first five minutes underwater
944.26	desperately trying to slow
944.26	my heart rate down.
947.26	I was just sitting there thinking,
948.936	"""I've got to slow this down."
948.936	"I'm going to fail."""
951.648	And I was getting more nervous.
953.26	And the heart rate
953.26	just kept going up and up,
955.427	all the way up to 150 beats.
960.247	Basically it's the same thing that created
960.247	my downfall at Lincoln Center.
963.937	It was a waste of O2.
966.26	When I made it to the halfway
966.26	mark, at eight minutes,
968.808	I was 100 percent certain
971.26	that I was not going
971.26	to be able to make this.
973.427	There was no way for me to do it.
976.429	I figured, Oprah had dedicated an hour
979.26	to doing this breath-hold thing,
979.26	if I had cracked early,
982.26	it would be a whole show
982.26	about how depressed I am.
985.26	(Laughter)
987.26	So, I figured I'm better off just fighting
987.26	and staying there until I black out,
991.26	at least then they can pull me out
991.26	and take care of me and all that.
994.523	(Laughter)
998.26	I kept pushing to 10 minutes.
1000.332	At 10 minutes you start getting all
1000.332	these really strong tingling sensations
1004.068	in your fingers and toes.
1005.672	And I knew that that was blood shunting,
1007.632	when the blood rushes away
1007.632	from your extremities
1010.15	to provide oxygen to your vital organs.
1015.26	At 11 minutes I started feeling
1015.26	throbbing sensations in my legs,
1019.895	and my lips started
1019.895	to feel really strange.
1023.26	At minute 12 I started
1023.26	to have ringing in my ears,
1027.26	and I started to feel my arm going numb.
1030.26	And I'm a hypochondriac, and I remember
1030.26	arm numb means heart attack.
1033.523	So, I started to really
1033.523	get really paranoid.
1037.291	Then at 13 minutes, maybe
1037.291	because of the hypochondria,
1040.226	I started feeling pains all over my chest.
1044.26	It was awful.
1045.337	(Laughter)
1046.362	At 14 minutes,
1046.362	I had these awful contractions,
1050.26	like this urge to breathe.
1052.26	(Laughter)
1058.131	(Laughter ends)
1060.26	At 15 minutes I was suffering
1060.26	major O2 deprivation to the heart.
1065.26	And I started having
1065.26	ischemia to the heart.
1068.26	My heartbeat would go from 120 to 50,
1071.109	to 150, to 40, to 20, to 150 again.
1076.26	It would skip a beat.
1078.26	It would start. It would stop.
1078.26	And I felt all this.
1080.684	And I was sure that I was going
1080.684	to have a heart attack.
1083.375	So, at 16 minutes what I did
1083.375	is I slid my feet out
1086.26	because I knew that if I did go out,
1086.26	if I did have a heart attack,
1090.848	they'd have to jump into the binding
1090.848	and take my feet out
1093.679	before pulling me up.
1094.846	I was really nervous.
1096.254	I let my feet out,
1096.254	and I started floating to the top.
1098.932	And I didn't take my head out.
1100.463	But I was just floating there
1100.463	waiting for my heart to stop,
1103.423	just waiting.
1104.447	"They had doctors with the ""Pst,"""
1104.447	you know, sitting there waiting.
1108.26	And then suddenly I hear screaming.
1110.827	And I think that there
1110.827	is some weird thing --
1112.961	that I had died or something had happened.
1115.26	And then I realized
1115.26	that I had made it to 16:32.
1119.26	So, with the energy
1119.26	of everybody that was there,
1122.26	I decided to keep pushing.
1124.26	And I went to 17 minutes and four seconds.
1126.73	(Applause)
1134.504	(Applause ends)
1136.26	As though that wasn't enough,
1136.26	what I did immediately after
1139.046	is I went to Quest Labs
1140.46	and had them take every blood
1140.46	sample that they could
1142.988	to test for everything
1142.988	and to see where my levels were,
1145.639	so the doctors could use it, once again.
1147.653	I also didn't want anybody to question it.
1149.693	I had the world record and I wanted
1149.693	to make sure it was legitimate.
1153.26	So, I get to New York City the next day,
1156.26	I'm walking out of the Apple store,
1159.523	and this kid walks up to me
1159.523	"he's like, ""Yo, D!"""
1161.795	"I'm like ""Yeah?"""
1163.26	"He said, ""If you really"
1163.26	held your breath that long,
1166.26	"why'd you come out of the water dry?"""
1168.26	"I was like ""What?"""
1170.26	(Laughter)
1172.26	And that's my life. So --
1174.26	(Laughter)
1179.26	As a magician,
1179.26	I try to show things to people
1181.38	that seem impossible.
1183.26	And I think magic,
1184.765	whether I'm holding my breath
1184.765	or shuffling a deck of cards,
1188.26	is pretty simple.
1190.26	It's practice, it's training,
1190.26	and it's -- (Sobs)
1194.73	It's practice, it's training
1194.73	and experimenting,
1197.546	(Sobs)
1198.841	while pushing through the pain
1198.841	to be the best that I can be.
1201.994	And that's what magic
1201.994	is to me, so, thank you.
1205.427	(Applause)
