12.58	"""Robam kbach boran,"""
14.38	or the art of Khmer classical dance,
16.18	is more than 1,000 years old.
18.82	It was developed as a prayer in movement
21.42	for rain and fertility,
23.62	and a prosperity that this meant
23.62	for an agricultural society.
28.82	Dancers who were both men and women
31.58	were offered to temples
32.86	where they served as living bridges
32.86	between heaven and earth.
36.62	Their dancing bodies carried the prayers
36.62	of the people up to the gods,
41.58	and the will of the deities
41.58	was delivered back through them
44.98	to the people and the land.
49.54	There are a lot of curves in Khmer dance.
53.26	Our backs are arched,
55.58	our knees are bent,
57.5	our toes are curled,
59.54	our elbows are hyperflexed
61.9	and our fingers are curved backwards.
65.42	All of these curves
65.42	create a serpentine impression,
69.1	and this is important because before
69.1	the introduction of major religions,
73.9	Khmers, and people all over the world
73.9	practiced animism.
80.94	Serpents were especially important
80.94	in this belief system
83.86	because in their fluid,
83.86	curvilinear movement,
88.26	they mimicked the flow of water.
91.34	So to invoke the serpent
91.34	in your dancing body then
94.9	was to conjure the image
94.9	of rivers cutting across the earth:
99.5	inspire the flow of life-giving waters.
105.26	As you can see then,
106.58	Khmer classical dance
106.58	is a transformation of nature,
110.02	of both the physical world around us
110.02	and of our own internal universe.
115.1	We have four primary
115.1	hand gestures that we use.
118.1	Can we do them together?
120.46	Yeah? OK.
123.9	This is a tree.
127.5	That tree will grow,
130.3	and then it will have leaves.
134.42	After it has leaves,
135.98	it'll have flowers,
139.78	and after it has flowers,
142.1	it'll have fruit.
144.7	That fruit will drop
147.06	and a new tree will grow.
149.1	And in those four gestures
151.18	is the cycle of life.
160.74	These four gestures are then used
163.38	to create a whole entire language
163.38	with which dancers express themselves.
168.06	So for example,
169.38	I can say,
170.74	"""I."""
172.82	"""I."""
174.5	In dance that would be ...
178.54	"""I."""
180.14	Or I can say ...
183.26	"""Hey you, come here, come here."""
186.22	In dance ...
191.26	"""Come here,"""
192.54	"or, ""Go, go."""
194.46	(Laughter)
198.7	"""Go."""
200.14	And everything from ...
204.1	love ...
211.1	to sadness,
213.3	to --
214.54	(Stomping)
215.58	anger
216.94	can be expressed
216.94	through the dance as well.
221.98	There's a certain magic
223.66	in the way that things are filtered,
223.66	transformed and put together
227.82	to create limitless possibilities in art.
231.42	The Khmer word for art,
233.18	silapak,
234.42	"in fact, at its root, means ""magic."""
238.14	The artist --
239.38	the silapakar,
240.9	or the silapakarani, then,
242.34	is nothing short of a magician.
246.18	I am very proud to say
248.14	that I belong to a long line of magicians,
251.18	from my teacher, Sophiline Cheam Shapiro,
254.3	to her teachers who were stars
254.3	in the royal palace,
258.18	to the ancient dancers of Angkor
260.98	and to the primal villagers
262.54	from which the art form
262.54	originally took life.
267.3	That said,
268.54	our cherished heritage was once
268.54	almost completely destroyed.
276.58	If you are wearing glasses,
278.38	please stand up.
284.58	If you speak more than one language,
286.98	please stand up.
293.14	If you have light skin,
294.74	please stand up.
303.62	Your glasses meant
303.62	that you could afford health care.
308.78	That second or third language you spoke
308.78	indicated your elite education.
315.14	Your light skin meant
315.14	you didn't have to work beneath the sun.
319.86	Under the Khmer Rouge,
321.42	who took over Cambodia from 1975 to 1979,
325.78	we would all be dead now,
327.98	targeted because of our assumed privilege.
336.98	You see,
338.22	the Khmer Rouge looked to Cambodia,
340.38	and they saw centuries
340.38	of rigid inequality.
344.02	The king and the few elites around him
346.22	had all the pleasures
346.22	and comforts of the world
349.1	while the mass majority
349.1	suffered from backbreaking labor
352.34	and harsh poverty.
354.54	You don't need a history book
354.54	to see that this is true.
357.94	"The Khmer word for ""I,"""
360.18	"for ""me,"""
362.3	is khnhom.
365.06	"This very same word can also mean ""slave"""
368.78	and dancers were in fact known
368.78	as knhom preah robam,
372.54	"or ""slaves of the sacred dance."""
377.02	The Khmer Rouge sought
377.02	to end slavery in Cambodia,
380.1	yet somehow they turned
380.1	everyone into slaves to do it.
384.22	They became the oppression
384.22	that they sought to end.
388.18	They evacuated the capital
389.9	and forced people into labor camps.
392.42	They tore families apart
394.34	and brainwashed children
394.34	against their own parents.
397.9	Everywhere, people were dying
397.9	and being killed,
401.18	losing their lives from disease,
403.26	overwork,
404.5	execution and starvation.
408.46	The result of this is that an entire third
408.46	of Cambodia's population was lost
413.18	in less than four years,
415.02	and in that number were 90 percent
415.02	of Khmer dance artists.
420.1	In other words,
421.34	nine out of 10 visions
421.34	for the tradition and future were lost.
427.58	Thankfully, however,
429.3	it was my teacher's teachers,
431.38	Chea Samy, Soth Sam On and Chheng Phon,
435.14	who would lead the revival of the art form
437.22	from the ashes of war and genocide:
440.58	one student,
442.14	one gesture,
443.74	one dance at a time.
445.74	They wrote the love,
447.66	magic,
449.14	beauty,
450.38	history and philosophy of our lineage
452.74	into the bodies of the next generation.
457.46	Nearly 40 years later,
459.38	Khmer classical dance
459.38	has been revived to new heights.
463.9	Yet somehow it still exists
463.9	in a vulnerable environment.
468.46	The disastrous effects of war
468.46	still haunt Khmer people today.
472.66	It is written in our bodies,
474.78	manifested in a genetic passage of PTSD
478.34	and in families facing cyclical poverty
481.14	and immense cultural rifts
481.14	and language barriers.
486.58	Yet beauty is a most resilient thing.
490.9	Beauty has this ability
490.9	to grow anywhere and everywhere
494.78	at any time.
497.38	Beauty is what connects people
497.38	through time and place.
502.46	Beauty is a liberation from suffering.
508.22	As Khmer artists work to revive
508.22	our culture and country,
511.82	we find that there are many paths
511.82	in which to move forward into the future.
517.82	And in a tradition where we often
517.82	don't know the dancer's names,
522.18	who they were,
523.42	what their lives were like,
524.94	what they felt,
526.82	let me propose that we move forward
526.82	"honestly and openly from ""khnhom."""
533.34	Khnhom not as in slave,
535.42	but as in conscious service.
538.54	Khnhom:
540.06	"""I,"""
541.7	"""me,"""
543.22	"""flowering."""
546.34	My name is Prumsodun Ok.
548.62	I am Khmer,
549.86	and I am American.
551.86	I am the child of refugees,
554.22	a creator, a healer,
556.18	and a builder of bridges.
558.7	I am my teacher's first male student
561.1	in a tradition understood
561.1	by many as female,
564.42	and I founded Cambodia's first
564.42	gay dance company.
568.62	I am the incarnation
568.62	of the beauty, dreams and power
572.82	of those who came before me.
574.78	The convergence
574.78	of past, present and future,
578.3	and of individual and collective.
582.9	Let me then play
582.9	that ancient and ageless role
586.14	of the artist as messenger,
588.26	by sharing the words of Chheng Phon
592.06	"""A garden with only one type of flower,"
595.66	or flowers of only one color,
597.7	"is no good."""
600.46	This is a reminder that our strength,
604.02	growth,
605.26	survival
606.5	and very existence,
607.74	lies in diversity.
610.5	It is, however,
611.78	a message of courage as well.
615.02	For a flower does not ask
615.02	for anyone's permission to bloom.
619.82	It was born to offer itself to the world.
623.3	Fearless love is its nature.
626.7	Thank you.
627.94	(Applause)
