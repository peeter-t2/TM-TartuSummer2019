15.965	In System D, this
18.19	is a store,
20.237	and what I mean by that is that this is a photograph
22.564	I took in Makoko, shantytown in Lagos, Nigeria.
27.879	It's built over the lagoon, and there are no streets
30.262	where there can be stores to shop,
32.078	and so the store comes to you.
33.968	And in the same community,
35.753	this is business synergy.
37.505	This is the boat that that lady was paddling around in,
41.611	and this artisan makes the boat and the paddles
44.351	and sells directly
45.656	to the people who need the boat and the paddles.
47.82	And this is a global business.
50.002	Ogandiro smokes fish in Makoko in Lagos,
54.128	"and I asked her, ""Where does the fish come from?"""
57.089	"And I thought she'd say, ""Oh, you know,"
59.815	"up the lagoon somewhere, or maybe across Africa,"""
62.716	but you'll be happy to know she said
64.147	it came from here, it comes from the North Sea.
66.204	It's caught here, frozen, shipped down to Lagos,
68.53	smoked, and sold for a tiny increment of profit
71.617	on the streets of Lagos.
73.139	And this is a business incubator.
74.99	This is Olusosun dump, the largest garbage dump in Lagos,
78.692	and 2,000 people work here, and I found this out
81.763	from this fellow, Andrew Saboru.
84.181	Andrew spent 16 years scavenging materials on the dump,
88.341	earned enough money to turn himself into a contract scaler,
91.569	which meant he carried a scale and went around and
94.179	weighed all the materials that people had scavenged
96.403	from the dump. Now he's a scrap dealer.
99.426	That's his little depot behind him,
101.827	and he earns twice the Nigerian minimum wage.
106.338	This is a shopping mall.
108.6	This is Oshodi Market in Lagos.
110.775	"Jorge Luis Borges had a story called ""The Aleph,"""
113.121	and the Aleph is a point in the world
114.944	where absolutely everything exists,
117.239	and for me, this image is a point in the world
119.584	where absolutely everything exists.
122.048	So, what am I talking about when I talk about System D?
124.897	It's traditionally called the informal economy,
127.196	the underground economy, the black market.
130.824	I don't conceive of it that way.
133.117	I think it's really important to understand that something like
135.874	this is totally open. It's right there for you to find.
140.354	All of this is happening openly, and aboveboard.
143.081	There's nothing underground about it.
145.603	It's our prejudgment that it's underground.
148.985	I've pirated the term System D from the former French colonies.
153.49	There's a word in French that is débrouillardise,
156.586	that means to be self-reliant,
158.706	and the former French colonies have turned that into
162.069	System D for the economy of self-reliance,
164.626	or the DIY economy.
167.884	But governments hate the DIY economy,
171.013	and that's why -- I took this picture in 2007,
174.257	and this is the same market in 2009 --
178.809	and I think, when the organizers of this conference
181.115	were talking about radical openness,
182.542	they didn't mean that the streets should be open
185.098	and the people should be gone.
186.841	I think what we have is a pickle problem.
190.784	I had a friend who worked at a pickle factory,
193.724	and the cucumbers would come flying down
195.625	this conveyer belt, and his job was to pick off the ones
199.628	that didn't look so good and throw them in the bin
201.977	"labeled ""relish"" where they'd be crushed and mixed"
203.883	with vinegar and used for other kinds of profit.
207.209	This is the pickle economy.
209.52	We're all focusing on — this is a statistic from
212.025	earlier this month in the Financial Times —
214.604	we're all focusing on the luxury economy.
218.147	It's worth 1.5 trillion dollars every year, and that's
220.89	a vast amount of money, right?
222.634	That's three times the Gross Domestic Product of Switzerland.
225.882	So it's vast. But it should come with an asterisk,
230.68	and the asterisk is that it excludes two thirds of the workers
234.873	of the world.
235.926	1.8 billion people around the world work
239.315	in the economy that is unregulated and informal.
244.851	That's a huge number, and what does that mean?
248.131	Well, it means if it were united in a single political system,
252.884	one country, call it
257.139	"""The United Street Sellers Republic,"" the U.S.S.R.,"
260.14	"or ""Bazaaristan,"""
261.973	it would be worth 10 trillion dollars every year,
266.249	and that would make it the second largest economy
268.305	in the world, after the United States.
270.786	And given that projections are that the bulk
273.626	of economic growth over the next 15 years will come
277.291	from emerging economies in the developing world,
280.663	it could easily overtake the United States
282.794	and become the largest economy in the world.
286.16	So the implications of that are vast, because it means
289.695	that this is where employment is — 1.8 billion people —
293.218	and this is where we can create a more egalitarian world,
297.84	because people are actually able to earn money and live
301.811	and thrive, as Andrew Saboru did.
304.806	Big businesses have recognized this,
306.967	and what's fascinating about this slide,
308.946	it's not that the guys can carry boxes on their heads
311.204	and run around without dropping them off.
313.719	it's that the Gala sausage roll is a product that's made
316.814	by a global company called UAC foods
319.524	that's active throughout Africa and the Middle East,
322.091	but the Gala sausage roll is not sold in stores.
325.78	UAC foods has recognized that it won't sell if it's in stores.
329.117	It's only sold by a phalanx of street hawkers
333.222	who run around the streets of Lagos at bus stations
336.035	and in traffic jams and sell it as a snack,
340.508	and it's been sold that way for 40 years.
343.53	It's a business plan for a corporation.
345.7	And it's not just in Africa.
348.193	Here's Mr. Clean looking amorously at all the other
351.306	Procter &amp; Gamble products,
353.226	and Procter &amp; Gamble, you know,
355.674	the statistic always cited is that Wal-Mart
358.251	is their largest customer, and it's true, as one store,
363.107	Wal-Mart buys 15 percent, thus 15 percent
366.294	of Procter &amp; Gamble's business is with Wal-Mart,
369.394	but their largest market segment is something that they call
372.955	"""high frequency stores,"" which is all these tiny kiosks"
375.875	and the lady in the canoe and all these other businesses
379.186	that exist in System D, the informal economy,
384.533	and Procter &amp; Gamble makes 20 percent of its money
387.931	from that market segment,
389.98	and it's the only market segment that's growing.
393.416	"So Procter &amp; Gamble says, ""We don't care whether a store"
396.524	is incorporated or registered or anything like that.
399.418	"We want our products in that store."""
403.251	And then there's mobile phones.
405.423	This is an ad for MTN,
407.263	which is a South African multinational
409.905	active in about 25 countries,
412.654	and when they came into Nigeria —
414.215	Nigeria is the big dog in Africa.
416.172	One in seven Africans is a Nigerian,
418.496	and so everyone wants in to the mobile phone market
421.198	in Nigeria. And when MTN came in, they wanted
423.232	to sell the mobile service like I get in the United States
426.192	or like people get here in the U.K. or in Europe --
429.966	expensive monthly plans, you get a phone,
433.855	you pay overages,
435.855	you're killed with fees --
437.983	and their plan crashed and burned.
439.787	And they went back to the drawing board, and they retooled,
441.827	and they came up with another plan:
443.331	We don't sell you the phone,
445.517	we don't sell you the monthly plan.
447.347	We only sell you airtime.
450.483	And where's the airtime sold?
452.396	It's sold at umbrella stands all over the streets,
456.489	where people are unregistered, unlicensed,
460.213	but MTN makes most of its profits,
462.918	perhaps 90 percent of its profits,
465.605	from selling through System D, the informal economy.
470.267	And where do the phones come from?
472.103	Well, they come from here. This is in Guangzhou, China,
474.977	and if you go upstairs in this rather sleepy looking
478.413	electronics mall, you find the Guangzhou Dashatou
483.039	second-hand trade center,
485.912	and if you go in there, you follow the guys with the muscles
489.096	who are carrying the boxes, and where are they going?
491.758	They're going to Eddy in Lagos.
494.575	Now, most of the phones there are not second-hand at all.
497.279	The name is a misnomer.
498.586	Most of them are pirated. They have the name brand
501.494	on them, but they're not manufactured by the name brand.
504.575	Now, are there downsides to that?
507.231	Well, I guess. You know, China has no —
510.479	(Laughter) — no intellectual property, right?
513.771	Versace without the vowels.
515.672	Zhuomani instead of Armani.
517.734	S. Guuuci, and -- (Laughter) (Applause)
522.741	All around the world this is how products
525.87	are being distributed, so, for instance,
528.39	in one street market on Rua 25 de Março
531.549	in São Paulo, Brazil,
533.518	you can buy fake designer glasses.
536.814	You can buy cloned cologne.
538.877	You can buy pirated DVDs, of course.
541.652	You can buy New York Yankees caps
544.509	in all sorts of unauthorized patterns.
547.715	You can buy cuecas baratas, designer underwear
550.804	that isn't really manufactured by a designer,
553.101	and even pirated evangelical mixtapes. (Laughter)
557.475	Now, businesses tend to complain about this,
560.229	and their, they, I don't want to take away from their
563.768	entire validity of complaining about it,
565.806	but I did ask a major sneaker manufacturer earlier this year
570.304	what they thought about piracy,
573.201	"and they told me, ""Well, you can't quote me on this,"
574.548	"because if you quote me on this, I have to kill you,"""
576.648	but they use piracy as market research.
582.352	The sneaker manufacturer told me that if
585.576	they find that Pumas are being pirated, or Adidas
589.263	are being pirated and their sneakers aren't being pirated,
592.549	they know they've done something wrong. (Laughter)
595.434	So it's very important to them to track piracy
598.511	exactly because of this, and the people who are buying,
600.875	the pirates, are not their customers anyway,
602.995	because their customers want the real deal.
605.727	Now, there's another problem.
607.22	This is a real street sign in Lagos, Nigeria.
610.552	All of System D really doesn't pay taxes, right?
613.616	And when I think about that, first of all I think that
615.421	government is a social contract between the people and
619.135	the government, and if the government isn't transparent,
621.651	then the people aren't going to be transparent either,
623.872	but also that we're blaming the little guy
626.92	who doesn't pay his taxes, and we're not recognizing
628.857	that everyone's fudging things all over the world,
631.63	including some extremely respected businesses,
635.663	and I'll give you one example.
636.803	There was one company that paid 4,000 bribes
640.954	in the first decade of this millennium, and
643.352	a million dollars in bribes every business day, right?
648.253	All over the world. And that company
650.548	was the big German electronics giant Siemens.
653.454	So this goes on in the formal economy
657.332	as well as the informal economy,
659.53	so it's wrong of us to blame — and I'm not singling out
661.66	Siemens, I'm saying everyone does it. Okay?
665.379	I just want to end by saying that if Adam Smith
668.828	had framed out a theory of the flea market
671.668	instead of the free market, what would be some
674.979	of the principles?
676.988	First, it would be to understand that it could be
680.748	considered a cooperative, and this is a thought
682.939	from the Brazilian legal scholar Roberto Mangabeira Unger.
687.524	Cooperative development is a way forward.
690.117	Secondly, from the [Austrian] anarchist philosopher Paul Feyerabend,
694.795	facts are relative, and what is a massive right
699.083	of self-reliance to a Nigerian businessperson
702.068	is considered unauthorized and horrible to other people,
706.079	and we have to recognize that there are differences
708.096	in how people define things and what their facts are.
710.153	And third is, and I'm taking this from
713.253	the great American beat poet Allen Ginsberg,
716.533	that alternate economies barter and
719.685	different kinds of currency, alternate currencies
722.436	are also very important, and he talked about
725.278	buying what he needed just with his good looks.
728.269	And so I just want to leave you there, and say that
731.9	this economy is a tremendous force for global development
736.116	and we need to think about it that way.
738.083	Thank you very much. (Applause)
741.099	(Applause)
