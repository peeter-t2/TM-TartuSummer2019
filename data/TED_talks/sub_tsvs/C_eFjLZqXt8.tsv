12.818	Once upon a time
14.328	we lived in an economy of financial growth and prosperity.
20.979	This was called the Great Moderation,
24.674	the misguided belief by most economists,
28.08	policymakers and central banks
31.383	that we have transformed into a new world
34.714	of never-ending growth and prosperity.
38.571	This was seen by robust and steady GDP growth,
43.314	by low and controlled inflation,
46.314	by low unemployment,
48.553	and controlled and low financial volatility.
52.459	But the Great Recession in 2007 and 2008,
59.091	the great crash, broke this illusion.
62.57	A few hundred billion dollars of losses in the financial sector
67.594	cascaded into five trillion dollars
71.674	of losses in world GDP
73.558	and almost $30 trillion losses
77.361	in the global stock market.
81.306	So the understanding of this Great Recession
86.501	was that this was completely surprising,
91.862	this came out of the blue,
93.208	this was like the wrath of the gods.
96.125	There was no responsibility.
97.916	So, as a reflection of this,
99.839	we started the Financial Crisis Observatory.
103.448	We had the goal to diagnose in real time
107.386	financial bubbles
109.757	and identify in advance their critical time.
115.614	What is the underpinning, scientifically, of this financial observatory?
118.972	"We developed a theory called ""dragon-kings."""
123.598	Dragon-kings represent extreme events
126.804	which are of a class of their own.
130.076	They are special. They are outliers.
132.919	They are generated by specific mechanisms
136.359	that may make them predictable,
139.245	perhaps controllable.
142.143	Consider the financial price time series,
145.97	a given stock, your perfect stock,
148.143	or a global index.
150.495	You have these up-and-downs.
152.549	A very good measure of the risk of this financial market
156.111	is the peaks-to-valleys that represent
158.533	a worst case scenario
160.829	when you bought at the top and sold at the bottom.
164.502	You can look at the statistics, the frequency of the occurrence
168.251	of peak-to-valleys of different sizes,
170.606	which is represented in this graph.
173.157	Now, interestingly, 99 percent
176.189	of the peak-to-valleys of different amplitudes
179.982	can be represented by a universal power law
183.442	represented by this red line here.
186.893	More interestingly, there are outliers, there are exceptions
191.039	which are above this red line,
192.942	occur 100 times more frequently, at least,
196.701	than the extrapolation would predict them to occur
200.854	based on the calibration of the 99 percent remaining
204.791	peak-to-valleys.
207.04	They are due to trenchant dependancies
211.64	such that a loss is followed by a loss
215.152	which is followed by a loss which is followed by a loss.
218.115	These kinds of dependencies
221.226	are largely missed by standard risk management tools,
226.838	which ignore them and see lizards
229.767	when they should see dragon-kings.
233.586	The root mechanism of a dragon-king
237.503	is a slow maturation towards instability,
240.639	which is the bubble,
242.261	and the climax of the bubble is often the crash.
244.891	This is similar to the slow heating of water
248.516	in this test tube reaching the boiling point,
251.419	where the instability of the water occurs
253.909	and you have the phase transition to vapor.
257.246	And this process, which is absolutely non-linear --
260.923	cannot be predicted by standard techniques --
263.203	is the reflection of a collective emergent behavior
267.379	which is fundamentally endogenous.
269.758	So the cause of the crash, the cause of the crisis
272.971	has to be found in an inner instability of the system,
276.155	and any tiny perturbation will make this instability occur.
282.191	Now, some of you may have come to the mind
285.891	that is this not related to the black swan concept
288.516	you have heard about frequently?
291.451	Remember, black swan is this rare bird
293.868	that you see once and suddenly shattered your belief
297.277	that all swans should be white,
299.751	so it has captured the idea of unpredictability,
303.295	unknowability, that the extreme events
304.804	are fundamentally unknowable.
307.635	Nothing can be further
309.36	from the dragon-king concept I propose,
311.998	which is exactly the opposite, that most extreme events
315.716	are actually knowable and predictable.
318.939	So we can be empowered and take responsibility
322.444	and make predictions about them.
324.663	So let's have my dragon-king burn this black swan concept.
327.863	(Laughter)
329.489	There are many early warning signals
332.429	that are predicted by this theory.
334.308	Let me just focus on one of them:
336.675	the super-exponential growth with positive feedback.
339.827	What does it mean?
340.987	Imagine you have an investment
343.16	that returns the first year five percent,
346.314	the second year 10 percent, the third year 20 percent,
349.469	the next year 40 percent. Is that not marvelous?
352.011	This is a super-exponential growth.
355.409	A standard exponential growth corresponds
357.346	to a constant growth rate, let's say, of 10 percent
361.09	The point is that, many times during bubbles,
364.571	there are positive feedbacks which can be of many times,
368.168	such that previous growths enhance,
371.867	push forward, increase the next growth
375.355	through this kind of super-exponential growth,
377.857	which is very trenchant, not sustainable.
380.971	And the key idea is that the mathematical solution
384.028	of this class of models exhibit finite-time singularities,
387.666	which means that there is a critical time
391.019	where the system will break, will change regime.
394.223	It may be a crash. It may be just a plateau, something else.
397.499	And the key idea is that the critical time,
399.766	the information about the critical time is contained
402.295	in the early development of this super-exponential growth.
407.779	We have applied this theory early on, that was our first success,
412.139	to the diagnostic of the rupture of key elements
415.698	on the iron rocket.
418.227	Using acoustic emission, you know, this little noise
421.049	that you hear a structure emit, sing to you
423.346	when they are stressed, and reveal the damage going on,
427.037	there's a collective phenomenon of positive feedback,
429.477	the more damage gives the more damage,
431.174	so you can actually predict,
433.649	within, of course, a probability band,
435.789	when the rupture will occur.
437.702	So this is now so successful that it is used
440.137	in the initial phase of [unclear] the flight.
444.502	Perhaps more surprisingly, the same type of theory
447.309	applies to biology and medicine,
450.037	parturition, the act of giving birth, epileptic seizures.
453.733	From seven months of pregnancy, a mother
457.357	starts to feel episodic precursory contractions of the uterus
463.021	that are the sign of these maturations
467.125	toward the instability, giving birth to the baby,
470.549	the dragon-king.
472.92	So if you measure the precursor signal,
475.526	you can actually identify pre- and post-maturity problems
481.751	in advance.
483.222	Epileptic seizures also come in a large variety of size,
486.982	and when the brain goes to a super-critical state,
490.262	you have dragon-kings which have a degree of predictability
493.835	and this can help the patient to deal with this illness.
499.342	We have applied this theory to many systems,
501.527	landslides, glacier collapse,
504.382	even to the dynamics of prediction of success:
507.949	blockbusters, YouTube videos, movies, and so on.
512.335	But perhaps the most important application
515.471	is for finance, and this theory
517.837	illuminates, I believe, the deep reason
521.276	for the financial crisis that we have gone through.
523.972	This is rooted in 30 years of history of bubbles,
528.02	starting in 1980, with the global bubble
531.732	crashing in 1987,
533.819	followed by many other bubbles.
536.188	"The biggest one was the ""new economy"" Internet bubble"
538.9	in 2000, crashing in 2000,
540.825	the real estate bubbles in many countries,
542.873	financial derivative bubbles everywhere,
545.653	stock market bubbles also everywhere,
547.942	commodity and all bubbles, debt and credit bubbles --
551.893	bubbles, bubbles, bubbles.
554.606	We had a global bubble.
557.245	This is a measure of global overvaluation
561.486	of all markets, expressing what I call
565.508	an illusion of a perpetual money machine
568.677	that suddenly broke in 2007.
572.629	The problem is that we see the same process,
576.863	in particular through quantitative easing,
579.594	of a thinking of a perpetual money machine nowadays
582.778	to tackle the crisis since 2008 in the U.S., in Europe,
587.181	in Japan.
589.469	This has very important implications
591.859	to understand the failure of quantitative easing
595.937	as well as austerity measures
597.813	as long as we don't attack the core,
600.622	the structural cause of this perpetual money machine thinking.
605.813	Now, these are big claims.
608.429	Why would you believe me?
611.311	Well, perhaps because, in the last 15 years
614.191	we have come out of our ivory tower,
617.383	and started to publish ex ante --
620.119	"and I stress the term ex ante, it means ""in advance"" â€”"
623.447	before the crash confirmed
625.585	the existence of the bubble or the financial excesses.
628.271	These are a few of the major bubbles
631.993	that we have lived through in recent history.
636.471	Again, many interesting stories for each of them.
639.311	Let me tell you just one or two stories
642.025	that deal with massive bubbles.
644.071	We all know the Chinese miracle.
646.407	This is the expression of the stock market
649.477	of a massive bubble, a factor of three,
654.527	In September 2007,
657.729	I was invited as a keynote speaker of a macro hedge fund
661.376	management conference,
663.825	and I showed to the conference a prediction
667.88	that by the end of 2007, this bubble
672.073	would change regime.
674.042	There might be a crash. Certainly not sustainable.
677.127	Now, how do you believe the very smart,
682.369	very motivated, very informed macro hedge fund managers
687.799	reacted to this prediction?
689.755	You know, they had made billions
691.711	just surfing this bubble until now.
694.546	"They told me, ""Didier,"
696.13	yeah, the market might be overvalued,
699.167	but you forget something.
701.063	There is the Beijing Olympic Games coming
703.415	in August 2008, and it's very clear that
705.679	the Chinese government is controlling the economy
708.871	and doing what it takes
710.224	"to also avoid any wave and control the stock market."""
714.671	Three weeks after my presentation,
717.142	the markets lost 20 percent
719.268	and went through a phase of volatility,
721.529	upheaval, and a total market loss of
726.523	So how can we be so collectively wrong
729.399	by misreading or ignoring the science
733.541	of the fact that when an instability has developed,
736.372	and the system is ripe, any perturbation
738.823	makes it essentially impossible to control?
742.504	The Chinese market collapsed, but it rebounded.
747.209	In 2009, we also identified that this new bubble,
751.965	a smaller one, was unsustainable,
754.551	so we published again a prediction, in advance,
758.183	stating that by August 2009, the market will correct,
762.51	will not continue on this track.
765.191	Our critics, reading the prediction,
768.343	"said, ""No, it's not possible."
772.256	The Chinese government is there.
773.75	They have learned their lesson. They will control.
776.432	"They want to benefit from the growth."""
778.239	Perhaps these critics have not learned their lesson previously.
781.895	So the crisis did occur. The market corrected.
785.727	"The same critics then said, ""Ah, yes,"
788.063	but you published your prediction.
789.912	You influenced the market.
791.568	"It was not a prediction."""
794.701	Maybe I am very powerful then.
798.058	Now, this is interesting.
800.102	It shows that it's essentially impossible until now
803.039	to develop a science of economics
805.167	because we are sentient beings who anticipate
808.31	and there is a problem of self-fulfilling prophesies.
812.373	So we invented a new way of doing science.
816.106	We created the Financial Bubble Experiment.
818.818	The idea is the following. We monitor the markets.
821.49	We identify excesses, bubbles.
825.658	We do our work. We write a report
828.962	in which we put our prediction of the critical time.
833.234	We don't release the report. It's kept secret.
835.809	But with modern encrypting techniques,
838.674	we have a hash, we publish a public key,
842.696	and six months later, we release the report,
846.651	and there is authentication.
849.05	And all this is done on an international archive
853.818	so that we cannot be accused of just releasing the successes.
858.018	Let me tease you with a very recent analysis.
864.668	we identified that the U.S. stock market
866.346	was on an unsustainable path
868.738	and we released this on our website on the 21st of May
872.54	that there will be a change of regime.
874.585	The next day, the market started to change regime, course.
879.369	This is not a crash.
880.86	This is just the third or fourth act
883.459	of a massive bubble in the making.
886.322	Scaling up the discussion at the size of the planet,
889.418	we see the same thing.
890.443	Wherever we look, it's observable:
893.364	in the biosphere, in the atmosphere, in the ocean,
896.594	showing these super-exponential trajectories
900.498	characterizing an unsustainable path
903.129	and announcing a phase transition.
905.746	This diagram on the right
907.45	shows a very beautiful compilation of studies
910.45	suggesting indeed that there is a nonlinear -- possibility
914.16	for a nonlinear transition just in the next few decades.
918.309	So there are bubbles everywhere.
921.931	From one side, this is exciting
923.895	for me, as a professor who chases bubbles
926.655	and slays dragons, as the media has sometimes called me.
931.413	But can we really slay the dragons?
934.464	Very recently, with collaborators,
936.608	we studied a dynamical system
939.311	where you see the dragon-king as these big loops
942.215	and we were able to apply tiny perturbations at the right times
946.136	that removed, when control is on, these dragons.
951.071	"""Gouverner, c'est prÃ©voir."""
954.005	Governing is the art of planning and predicting.
959.799	But is it not the case that this is probably
962.552	one of the biggest gaps of mankind,
966.452	which has the responsibility to steer
969.712	our societies and our planet toward sustainability
972.428	in the face of growing challenges and crises?
977.272	But the dragon-king theory gives hope.
981.767	We learn that most systems have pockets of predictability.
985.335	It is possible to develop advance diagnostics of crises
990.235	so that we can be prepared, we can take measures,
993.794	we can take responsibility,
996.549	and so that never again will
999.296	extremes and crises like the Great Recession
1003.15	or the European crisis take us by surprise.
1007.56	Thank you.
1009.035	(Applause)
