12.756	Silicon Valley
12.756	is obsessed with disruption,
16.38	but these days, the biggest disruptor
16.38	didn't come out of Silicon Valley.
20.899	It came out of steel towns in Ohio,
24.1	rural communities in Pennsylvania,
27.42	the Panhandle in Florida.
30.82	And this last US presidential election
33.78	was the mother of all disruptions.
36.98	Once again, politics is personal.
40.94	Millions of Americans
40.94	became activists overnight,
44.38	pouring into the streets in record numbers
47.22	in record time.
48.66	(Laughter)
50.5	The election has done
50.5	to family holiday dinners
52.86	what Uber has done
52.86	to New York City's taxi system.
57.06	Couples have broken up
57.06	and marriages disrupted.
61.98	And the election
61.98	is doing to my private life
64.1	what Amazon is doing to shopping malls.
66.66	These days, the ACLU
66.66	is on the front lines 24/7,
71.94	and even if I manage to sneak away
71.94	for a couple of miles on the treadmill,
77.059	any cardio benefit I get
77.059	is instantly obliterated
80.9	when I read another presidential tweet
80.9	on the headline scroll.
86.1	Even my secret pleasure
88.78	of studying the Italian painters
91.3	have been infected by politics.
94.54	Now, I study, even stalk, the old masters.
98.1	This is my desk,
99.7	with a postcard exhibition
101.54	of some famous and obscure paintings
103.42	mostly from the Italian Renaissance.
106.1	Now, art used to provide me
106.1	with a necessary break
108.58	from the hurly-burly of politics
110.9	in my daily work at the ACLU,
113.3	but not anymore.
115.38	I was at the Women's March
115.38	in San Francisco
117.46	the day after inauguration,
119.02	and the crowd was chanting,
119.02	"""This is what democracy looks like."""
122.1	"""This is what democracy looks like."""
125.38	And there I was holding my sign
125.38	and my umbrella in the rain,
129.38	and I flashed on an old painting
133.22	that first captivated me many years ago.
136.34	I struggled to remember
136.34	the different pieces
139.7	of an actual painting
142.06	of good and bad government.
144.98	It was almost like the old master
144.98	was taunting me.
148.14	You want to know
148.14	what democracy looks like?
150.66	Go back and look at my frescoes.
153.78	And so I did.
155.98	In 1339, Ambrogio Lorenzetti
155.98	finished a monumental commission
161.78	in the governing council chamber
161.78	of Siena's Palazzo Pubblico.
165.62	It's a painting that speaks to us,
165.62	even screams to us, today.
172.3	"""Art is a lie that makes us"
172.3	"realize truth,"""
176.1	Pablo Picasso once said.
178.5	And as we search for the truth
178.5	about government,
180.78	we should keep Ambrogio's work,
182.7	not a lie but an allegory,
182.7	in our collective mind's eye.
188.38	During Lorenzetti's time,
189.82	the political legitimacy
189.82	of Italian city-states
193.14	was often on very shaky ground.
195.62	Siena was a republic,
197.5	but there had been enormous unrest
199.18	in the two decades
199.18	leading up to the commission.
202.06	Siena's political leaders,
202.06	who would literally govern
205.38	under the eyes
205.38	of these allegorical figures,
208.58	were Lorenzetti's intended audience.
211.54	He was cataloging the obligations
213.78	of the governing to the governed.
218.22	Now, you can spend years
218.22	studying these frescoes.
221.26	Some scholars have.
223.18	I'm hardly an art historian,
225.34	but I am passionate about art,
227.94	and a work this massive can overwhelm me.
230.54	So first, I focus on the big stuff.
235.62	This is the allegory of good government.
239.58	The majestic figure here in the middle
241.82	is dressed in Siena's colors
244.26	and he personifies the republic itself.
248.02	"Lorenzetti labels him ""Commune,"""
251.1	and he's basically telling the Sienese
253.78	that they, and not a king or a tyrant,
253.78	must rule themselves.
258.94	Now, surrounding Commune are his advisors.
265.58	Justice is enthroned.
267.7	She's looking up at the figure of wisdom,
270.86	who actually supports
270.86	her scales of justice.
276.82	Concord, or Harmony,
279.38	holds a string that comes
279.38	off the scales of justice
282.54	that binds her to the citizens,
284.58	making them all
284.58	compatriots in the republic.
290.02	And finally we see Peace.
291.7	She looks chilled out,
293.18	like she's listening to Bob Marley.
295.58	When good government rules,
297.58	Peace doesn't break a sweat.
300.06	Now, these are big images and big ideas,
302.5	but I really love the small stuff.
305.3	Along another wall,
306.74	Lorenzetti illustrates
306.74	the effects of good government
310.1	on the real and everyday lives
310.1	of ordinary people
312.5	with a series of delicious little details.
317.26	In the countryside,
317.26	the hills are landscaped and farmed.
323.1	Crops are being sown,
323.1	hoed, reaped, milled, plowed,
326.82	all in one picture.
330.82	Crops and livestock
330.82	are being brought to market.
335.3	In the city, builders raise a tower.
340.22	People attend a law lecture,
340.22	a TED Talk of the 14th century.
344.06	(Laughter)
347.1	Schoolchildren play.
350.86	Tradesmen thrive.
354.82	Dancers larger than life dance with joy.
360.22	And watching over the republic
360.22	is the winged figure Security,
364.38	whose banner reads,
365.86	"""Everyone shall go forth"
365.86	"freely without fear."""
371.06	Now, what's amazing
371.06	about these images from 800 years ago
373.78	is that they're familiar to us today.
376.34	We see what democracy looks like.
378.7	We experience the effects
378.7	of good government in our lives,
382.14	just as Lorenzetti did in his life.
386.78	But it is the allegory of bad government
389.74	that has been haunting me
389.74	since November 9.
393.1	It's badly damaged,
394.62	but it reads like today's newspapers.
397.34	And ruling over bad government
397.34	is not the Commune
400.3	but the Tyrant.
402.46	He has horns, tusks, crossed eyes,
405.62	braided hair.
407.18	He obviously spends
407.18	a lot of time on that hair.
409.62	(Laughter)
410.78	Justice now lies helpless at his feet,
415.1	shackled.
416.42	Her scales have been severed.
418.94	Justice is the key antagonist
418.94	to the Tyrant,
421.94	and she's been taken out.
424.46	Now, surrounding the Tyrant,
425.86	Lorenzetti illustrates
425.86	the vices that animate bad government.
431.1	Avarice is the old woman
431.1	clutching the strongbox
434.82	and a fisherman's hook
436.54	to pull in her fortune.
440.9	Vainglory carries a mirror,
443.94	and Lorenzetti warns us
443.94	against narcissistic leaders
447.02	who are guided
447.02	by their own ego and vanity.
451.34	On the Tyrant's right is Cruelty.
459.22	Treason, half lamb, half scorpion,
462.54	lulls us into a false sense of security
465.3	and then poisons a republic.
468.82	Fraud, with the flighty wings of a bat.
476.86	On the Tyrant's left, you see Division.
479.74	She's dressed in Siena's colors.
482.06	"""Si"" and ""No"" are painted on her body."
485.54	She uses a carpenter's saw
485.54	to chop her body in half.
493.1	And Fury wields the weapons of the mob,
496.06	the stone and knife.
503.1	In the remainder of the fresco,
503.1	Lorenzetti shows us
505.54	the inevitable effects of bad government.
507.98	The civic ideals celebrated
507.98	elsewhere in this room have failed us,
511.54	and we see it.
513.1	The once beautiful city
513.1	has fallen to pieces,
515.86	the countryside barren,
517.7	the farms abandoned.
519.26	Many are in flames.
521.9	And in the sky above
521.9	is not the winged figure Security,
525.78	but that of Fear, whose banner reads:
529.46	"""None shall pass along this road"
532.499	"without fear of death."""
537.02	Now, the final image,
537.02	the most important one, really,
539.54	is one that Lorenzetti did not paint.
541.38	It is of the viewer.
542.66	Today, the audience
542.66	for Lorenzetti's frescoes
545.46	is not the governing but the governed,
548.94	the individual who stands
548.94	in front of his allegories
551.78	and walks away with insight,
554.3	who heeds a call to action.
557.34	Lorenzetti warns us
557.34	that we must recognize the shadows
560.06	of Avarice, Fraud, Division, even Tyranny
563.98	when they float
563.98	across our political landscape,
566.7	especially when those shadows are cast
569.54	by political leaders loudly claiming
569.54	to be the voice of good government
574.22	and promising to make America great again.
578.7	And we must act.
581.02	Democracy must not be a spectator sport.
583.7	The right to protest,
583.7	the right to assemble freely,
586.14	the right to petition one's government,
588.06	these are not just rights.
589.9	In the face of Avarice,
589.9	Fraud and Division,
592.42	these are obligations.
594.78	We have to disrupt --
596.1	(Applause)
601.54	We have to disrupt our lives
603.74	so that we can disrupt
605.42	the amoral accretion of power
608.18	by those who would betray our values.
612.86	We and we the people
614.78	must raise justice up
616.66	and must bring peace to our nation
618.62	and must come together in concord,
620.82	and we have a choice.
623.62	We could either paint ourselves
625.18	into the worst nightmare
625.18	of Lorenzetti's bad government,
629.14	or we can stay in the streets,
631.94	disruptive, messy, loud.
635.5	That is what democracy looks like.
638.86	Thank you.
640.1	(Applause)
651.22	Chris Anderson: First of all, wow.
653.18	Obviously, many people passionately --
655.62	you spoke to many people
655.62	passionately here.
657.66	I'm sure there are other people here
659.42	who'd say, look, Trump was elected
659.42	by 63 million people.
664.14	He's far from perfect,
665.5	but he's trying to do
665.5	what he was elected to do.
668.5	Shouldn't you give him a chance?
670.54	Anthony Romero:
670.54	I think we have to recognize
672.66	the legitimacy of him as president
675.46	versus the legitimacy of his policies.
678.38	And when so many of the policies
678.38	are contrary to fundamental values,
684.18	that we're all equal under the law,
686.14	that we're not judged by the color
686.14	of our skin or the religion we worship,
689.74	we have to contest those values
692.5	even as we recognize and honor the fact
694.78	that our democracy rendered us a president
694.78	who is championing those values.
700.22	CA: And the ACLU isn't just
700.22	this force on the left, right?
704.06	You're making other arguments as well.
706.5	AR: Well, you know,
709.14	very often we piss
709.14	everyone off at one point.
711.3	That's what we do.
712.82	And we recently were taking stands
715.26	for why Ann Coulter needs
715.26	to be able to speak at Berkeley,
718.62	and why Milo has free speech rights.
721.06	And we even wrote a blog
722.66	that almost burnt the house down
722.66	among some of our members,
726.34	unfortunately,
726.34	when we talked about the fact
728.46	that even Donald Trump
728.46	has free speech rights as president,
731.94	and an effort to hold him accountable
734.02	for incitement of violence
734.02	at his marches or his rallies
738.62	is unconstitutional and un-American.
741.82	And when you put that statement out there
744.02	to a very frothy base
745.7	that always is very excited for you
745.7	to fight Donald Trump,
749.02	and then you have a new one saying,
749.02	"""Wait, these rights are for everybody,"
752.54	"even the president that we don't like."""
754.46	And that's our job.
756.06	(Applause)
759.22	CA: Anthony, you spoke
759.22	to so many of us so powerfully.
761.82	Thank you so much. Thank you.
763.42	(Applause)
