16.831	George and Charlotte Blonsky, who were
20.237	a married couple living in
20.237	the Bronx in New York City,
23.609	invented something.
24.854	They got a patent in
28.833	"""a device to assist women in giving birth."""
34.508	This device consists of a large, round table
38.438	and some machinery.
40.191	When the woman is ready to deliver her child,
43.4	she lies on her back,
44.801	she is strapped down to the table,
47.232	and the table is rotated at high speed.
50.311	The child comes flying out
53.736	through centrifugal force.
61.717	If you look at their patent carefully,
66.246	especially if you have any
66.246	engineering background or talent,
70.115	you may decide that you see
71.574	one or two points where the design is 
71.574	not perfectly adequate. (Laughter)
78.261	Doctor Ivan Schwab in California
81.03	is one of the people, 
81.03	one of the main people,
82.984	who helped answer the question,
84.57	"""Why don't woodpeckers get headaches?"""
90.281	And it turns out the answer to that
91.498	is because their brains
93.722	are packaged inside their skulls
95.493	in a way different from the way
97.993	our brains, we being human beings,
100.497	true, have our brains packaged.
104.456	They, the woodpeckers, typically
106.839	will peck, they will bang their head
109.027	on a piece of wood thousands 
109.027	of times every day. Every day!
114.318	And as far as anyone knows,
116.231	that doesn't bother them in the slightest.
117.437	How does this happen?
119.703	Their brain does not slosh around like ours does.
122.629	Their brain is packed in very tightly,
125.341	at least for blows coming 
125.341	right from the front.
128.197	Not too many people paid attention
130.14	to this research until
130.14	the last few years
133.224	when, in this country especially,
135.839	people are becoming curious about
137.227	what happens to the brains
137.227	of football players
139.422	who bang their heads repeatedly.
142.15	And the woodpecker maybe relates to that.
147.218	There was a paper published
149.311	in the medical journal The Lancet
151.056	in England a few years ago called
152.486	""" A man who pricked his finger"
152.486	"and smelled putrid for 5 years."""
159.903	Dr. Caroline Mills and her team
161.711	received this patient and didn't 
161.711	really know what to do about it.
165.81	The man had cut his finger,
167.67	he worked processing chickens,
171.143	and then he started to
171.143	smell really, really bad.
173.579	So bad that when 
173.579	he got in a room
174.798	with the doctors and the nurses,
176.115	they couldn't stand being 
176.115	in the room with him.
178.874	It was intolerable.
180.675	They tried every drug,
182.174	every other treatment
182.174	they could think of.
183.992	After a year, he still 
183.992	smelled putrid.
186.223	After two years, still smelled putrid.
188.032	Three years, four years,
188.032	still smelled putrid.
191.262	After five years, it went away on its own.
194.299	It's a mystery.
197.998	In New Zealand, Dr. Lianne Parkin
200.347	and her team tested an old 
200.347	tradition in her city.
205.909	They live in a city that has huge hills,
208.636	San Francisco-grade hills.
210.255	And in the winter there,
210.255	it gets very cold
212.372	and very icy.
213.556	There are lots of injuries.
215.15	The tradition that they tested,
217.415	they tested by asking people
219.047	who were on their way to 
219.047	work in the morning,
221.446	to stop and try something out.
223.389	Try one of two conditions.
225.392	The tradition is that in the winter,
228.145	in that city, you wear your socks
228.145	on the outside of your boots.
232.861	And what they discovered by experiment,
236.26	and it was quite graphic when they saw it,
238.429	was that it's true.
239.844	That if you wear your socks on the 
239.844	outside rather than the inside,
243.163	you're much more likely 
243.163	to survive and not slip and fall.
248.516	Now, I hope you will agree
248.516	with me that these things
253.894	I've just described to you,
256.109	each of them, deserves some kind of prize.
256.109	(Laughter)
262.289	And that's what they got,
263.924	each of them got an Ig Nobel prize.
267.199	In 1991, I, together with bunch of other people,
271.191	started the Ig Nobel prize ceremony.
274.094	Every year we give out 10 prizes.
277.026	The prizes are based on just 
277.026	one criteria. It's very simple.
284.009	It's that you've done something that 
284.009	makes people laugh and then think.
289.993	What you've done makes 
289.993	people laugh and then think.
298.582	their only possible reaction is to laugh.
301.893	And then a week later,
303.816	it's still rattling around in their heads
305.507	and all they want to do 
305.507	is tell their friends about it.
308.267	That's the quality we look for.
310.465	Every year, we get in the neighborhood
313.25	of 9,000 new nominations 
313.25	for the Ig Nobel prize.
317.692	Of those, consistently between 10 percent
320.521	and 20 percent of those nominations
323.004	are people who nominate themselves.
326.914	Those self-nominees almost never win.
330.881	It's very difficult, numerically, 
330.881	to win a prize if you want to.
335.2	Even if you don't want to,
337.045	it's very difficult numerically.
339.761	You should know that when 
339.761	we choose somebody
343.411	to win an Ig Nobel prize,
344.683	We get in touch with that person, very quietly.
348.259	We offer them the chance to decline
350.82	this great honor if they want to.
354.202	Happily for us, almost everyone 
354.202	who's offered a prize
357.526	decides to accept.
361.035	What do you get if you
361.035	win an Ig Nobel prize?
363.976	Well, you get several things.
365.553	You get an Ig Nobel prize.
369.083	The design is different every year.
371.414	These are always handmade
371.414	from extremely cheap materials.
376.22	You're looking at a picture
377.881	of the prize we gave last year, 2013.
381.91	Most prizes in the world also give
383.946	their winners some cash, some money.
388.644	We don't have any money,
389.707	so we can't give them.
391.218	In fact, the winners have to
391.218	pay their own way
394.094	to come to the Ig Nobel ceremony,
396.898	which most of them do.
398.761	Last year, though, we did manage
398.761	to scrape up some money.
401.754	Last year, each of the 10
401.754	Ig Nobel prize winners
406.265	received from us 10 trillion dollars.
412.043	A $10 trillion bill from Zimbabwe. (Laughter)
417.476	You may remember that 
417.476	Zimbabwe had a little adventure
420.3	for a few years there of inflation.
422.895	They ended up printing bills
424.515	that were in denominations as
424.515	large as 100 trillion dollars.
428.371	The man responsible, who runs
428.371	the national bank there, by the way,
431.156	won an Ig Nobel prize in mathematics.
433.929	The other thing you win is an invitation
435.681	to come to the ceremony,
437.184	which happens at Harvard University.
438.926	And when you get there,
440.061	you come to Harvard's biggest 
440.061	meeting place and classroom.
442.778	It fits 1,100 people,
444.063	it's jammed to the gills,
445.189	and up on the stage,
446.02	waiting to shake your hand,
447.814	waiting to hand you your Ig Nobel prize,
450.086	are a bunch of Nobel prize winners.
452.735	That's the heart of the ceremony.
454.034	The winners are kept secret until that moment,
456.184	even the Nobel laureates 
456.184	who will shake their hand
458.611	don't know who they are
458.611	until they're announced.
461.854	I am going to tell you 
461.854	about just a very few
464.974	of the other medical-related prizes we've given.
468.028	Keep in mind, we've given 230 prizes. 
470.284	There are lots of these people
470.284	who walk among you.
472.578	Maybe you have one.
474.698	A paper was published about 30 years ago
476.842	"called ""Injuries due to Falling Coconuts."""
479.352	It was written by Dr. Peter Barss,
481.307	who is Canadian.
483.518	Dr. Barss came to the ceremony
485.704	and explained that as a young doctor,
487.571	he wanted to see the world.
489.052	So he went to Papua New Guinea.
491.341	When he got there, he went to work
491.341	in a hospital, and he was curious
493.68	what kinds of things happen to people
493.68	that bring them to the hospital.
499.195	He looked through the 
499.195	records, and he discovered
500.493	that a surprisingly large number of people
503.283	in that hospital were there
504.449	because of injuries due to falling coconuts.
507.996	One typical thing that happens is
509.782	people will come from the highlands,
509.782	where there are not many coconut trees,
513.581	down to visit their relatives on the coast,
515.829	where there are lots.
517.289	And they'll think that a coconut tree
518.679	is a fine place to stand and maybe lie down.
521.348	A coconut tree that is 90 feet tall,
523.955	and has coconuts that weigh two pounds
526.178	that can drop off at any time.
530.23	A team of doctors in Europe
532.023	published a series of papers
532.023	about colonoscopies.
535.532	You're all familiar with colonoscopies,
537.562	one way or another.
538.854	Or in some cases,
540.169	one way and another.
543.674	They, in these papers,
547.023	explained to their fellow doctors
547.023	who perform colonoscopies,
551.191	how to minimize the chance
553.162	that when you perform a colonoscopy,
555.823	your patient will explode. (Laughter)
559.413	Dr. Emmanuel Ben-Soussan
561.373	one of the authors,
562.547	flew in from Paris to the ceremony,
565.706	where he explained the history of this,
567.597	that in the 1950s,
568.773	when colonoscopies were becoming
568.773	a common technique for the first time,
574.101	people were figuring out how to do it well.
576.74	And there were some difficulties at first.
579.5	The basic problem, I'm sure you're familiar with,
583.471	that you're looking inside a 
583.471	long, narrow, dark place.
588.8	And so, you want to have a larger space.
592.355	You add some gas to inflate it
594.486	so you have room to look around.
596.4	Now, that's added to the 
596.4	gas, the methane gas,
599.127	that's already inside.
600.635	The gas that they used at first,
600.635	in many cases, was oxygen.
603.635	So they added oxygen to methane gas.
606.084	And then they wanted to be able to see,
607.799	they needed light,
609.047	so they'd put in a light source,
610.452	which in the 1950s was very hot.
612.228	So you had methane gas, which is flammable,
615.546	oxygen and heat.
618.338	They stopped using oxygen pretty quickly.
618.338	(Laughter)
623.476	Now it's rare that patients will explode,
625.997	but it does still happen.
631.736	The final thing that I want 
631.736	to tell you about is a prize
635.311	we gave to Dr. Elena Bodnar.
637.742	Dr. Elena Bodnar invented a brassiere
641.867	that in an emergency
643.425	can be quickly separated 
644.618	into a pair of protective face masks.
648.137	One to save your life,
649.904	one to save the life of some 
649.904	lucky bystander. (Laughter)
655.228	Why would someone do this, you might wonder.
658.255	Dr. Bodnar came to the ceremony
660.387	and she explained that 
660.387	she grew up in Ukraine.
663.348	She was one of the doctors who treated victims
665.064	of the Chernobyl power plant meltdown.
667.108	And they later discovered that
669.692	a lot of the worst medical problems
671.617	came from the particles people breathed in.
673.739	So she was always thinking after that
675.667	about could there be some simple mask
677.294	that was available everywhere
677.294	when the unexpected happens.
681.99	Years later, she moved to America.
683.603	She had a baby,
684.447	One day she looked, and on the floor,
686.203	her infant son had picked up her bra,
689.274	and had her bra on his face.
691.133	And that's where the idea came from.
692.814	She came to the Ig Nobel ceremony
694.817	with the first prototype of the bra
697.157	and she demonstrated:
701.511	(Laughter) (Applause)
730.265	"[""Paul Krugman, Nobel laureate "
730.265	"(2008) in economics""]"
760.574	"[""Wolfgang Ketterle, Nobel "
760.574	"laureate (2001) in physics""]"
775.663	I myself own an emergency bra. (Laughter)
779.283	It's my favorite bra,
781.621	but I would be happy to 
781.621	share it with any of you,
784.273	should the need arise.
786.122	Thank you.
787.078	(Applause)
