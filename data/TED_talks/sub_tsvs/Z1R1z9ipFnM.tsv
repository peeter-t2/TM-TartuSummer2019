12.95	When I was seven years old,
14.65	some well-meaning adult asked me
14.65	what I wanted to be when I grew up.
18.785	"Proudly, I said: ""An artist."""
20.827	"""No, you don't,"" he said,"
22.212	"""You can't make a living being an artist!"""
24.915	My little seven-year-old
24.915	Picasso dreams were crushed.
28.014	But I gathered myself,
29.71	went off in search of a new dream,
31.593	eventually settling on being a scientist,
34.475	perhaps something like
34.475	the next Albert Einstein.
37.783	(Laughter)
40.086	I have always loved math and science,
42.111	later, coding.
43.646	And so I decided to study
43.646	computer programming in college.
47.312	In my junior year,
48.487	my computer graphics professor
48.487	showed us these wonderful short films.
52.917	It was the first computer animation
52.917	any of us had ever seen.
56.566	I watched these films
56.566	in wonder, transfixed,
59.37	fireworks going off in my head,
61.605	"thinking, ""That is what"
61.605	"I want to do with my life."""
65.006	The idea that all the math, science
65.006	and code I had been learning
68.563	could come together to create
68.563	these worlds and characters
71.725	and stories I connected with,
73.611	was pure magic for me.
76.126	Just two years later, I started working
78.039	at the place that made those films,
78.039	Pixar Animation Studios.
81.082	It was here I learned how
81.082	we actually execute those films.
84.303	To create our movies,
85.486	we create a three-dimensional
85.486	world inside the computer.
88.922	We start with a point that makes
88.922	a line that makes a face
92.549	that creates characters,
94.281	or trees and rocks
94.281	that eventually become a forest.
97.326	And because it's
97.326	a three-dimensional world,
99.462	we can move a camera
99.462	around inside that world.
103.004	I was fascinated by all of it.
105.441	But then I got my first taste of lighting.
108.581	Lighting in practice is placing lights
108.581	inside this three-dimensional world.
112.254	I actually have icons of lights
112.254	I move around in there.
114.998	Here you can see I've added a light,
116.744	I'm turning on the rough version
116.744	of lighting in our software,
119.632	turn on shadows
120.887	and placing the light.
122.315	As I place a light,
123.506	I think about what it might
123.506	look like in real life,
126.242	but balance that out with what we need
126.242	artistically and for the story.
130.981	So it might look like this at first,
134.155	but as we adjust this and move that
136.593	in weeks of work,
138.162	in rough form it might look like this,
141.252	and in final form, like this.
148.306	There's this moment in lighting
148.306	that made me fall utterly in love with it.
152.381	It's where we go from this
154.807	to this.
156.045	It's the moment where
156.045	all the pieces come together,
158.605	and suddenly the world comes to life
161.232	as if it's an actual place that exists.
164.009	This moment never gets old,
165.74	especially for that little seven-year-old
165.74	girl that wanted to be an artist.
169.632	As I learned to light,
170.809	I learned about using light
170.809	to help tell story,
174.442	to set the time of day,
177.258	to create the mood,
179.978	to guide the audience's eye,
182.85	how to make a character look appealing
185.033	or stand out in a busy set.
188.224	Did you see WALL-E?
189.558	(Laughter)
190.621	There he is.
193.49	As you can see,
194.737	we can create any world that we want
194.737	inside the computer.
197.468	We can make a world with monsters,
200.837	with robots that fall in love,
203.291	we can even make pigs fly.
205.359	(Laughter)
210.361	While this is an incredible thing,
212.162	this untethered artistic freedom,
214.661	it can create chaos.
216.667	It can create unbelievable worlds,
219.542	unbelievable movement,
221.05	things that are jarring to the audience.
223.224	So to combat this, we tether
223.224	ourselves with science.
226.432	We use science and the world we know
228.43	as a backbone,
229.804	to ground ourselves in something
229.804	relatable and recognizable.
233.806	"""Finding Nemo"" is an excellent"
233.806	example of this.
236.359	A major portion of the movie
236.359	takes place underwater.
239.028	But how do you make it look underwater?
241.302	In early research and development,
242.957	we took a clip of underwater footage
242.957	and recreated it in the computer.
246.879	Then we broke it back down
248.164	to see which elements make up
248.164	that underwater look.
251.526	One of the most critical elements
253.157	was how the light travels
253.157	through the water.
255.363	So we coded up a light
255.363	that mimics this physics --
258.183	first, the visibility of the water,
259.951	and then what happens with the color.
262.503	Objects close to the eye
262.503	have their full, rich colors.
266.069	As light travels deeper into the water,
268.296	we lose the red wavelengths,
270.23	then the green wavelengths,
271.598	leaving us with blue at the far depths.
274.666	In this clip you can see
274.666	two other important elements.
277.79	The first is the surge and swell,
279.836	or the invisible underwater current
281.577	that pushes the bits of particulate
281.577	around in the water.
284.786	The second is the caustics.
286.827	These are the ribbons of light,
288.361	like you might see
288.361	on the bottom of a pool,
290.409	that are created when the sun
290.409	bends through the crests
292.983	of the ripples and waves
292.983	on the ocean's surface.
297.038	Here we have the fog beams.
298.36	These give us color depth cues,
300.039	but also tells which direction is up
302.158	in shots where we don't
302.158	see the water surface.
304.788	The other really cool thing
304.788	you can see here
306.931	is that we lit that particulate
306.931	only with the caustics,
310.115	so that as it goes in and out
310.115	of those ribbons of light,
312.797	it appears and disappears,
314.334	lending a subtle, magical
314.334	sparkle to the underwater.
318.53	You can see how we're using the science --
321.096	the physics of water,
321.096	light and movement --
323.996	to tether that artistic freedom.
326.57	But we are not beholden to it.
328.915	We considered each of these elements
330.738	and which ones had to be
330.738	scientifically accurate
333.776	and which ones we could push and pull
333.776	to suit the story and the mood.
337.882	We realized early on that color
337.882	was one we had some leeway with.
341.715	So here's a traditionally colored
341.715	underwater scene.
344.351	But here, we can take Sydney Harbor
344.351	and push it fairly green
347.216	to suit the sad mood of what's happening.
350.315	In this scene, it's really important
350.315	we see deep into the underwater,
353.598	so we understand what
353.598	the East Australian Current is,
356.289	that the turtles are diving into
356.289	and going on this roller coaster ride.
359.701	So we pushed the visibility of the water
361.662	well past anything you would
361.662	ever see in real life.
364.843	Because in the end,
366.029	we are not trying to recreate
366.029	the scientifically correct real world,
370.677	we're trying to create a believable world,
372.741	one the audience can immerse
372.741	themselves in to experience the story.
377.344	We use science to create
377.344	something wonderful.
380.522	We use story and artistic touch
380.522	to get us to a place of wonder.
385.578	This guy, WALL-E, is a great
385.578	example of that.
388.078	He finds beauty in the simplest things.
390.532	But when he came in to lighting,
390.532	we knew we had a big problem.
393.978	We got so geeked-out on making
393.978	WALL-E this convincing robot,
397.447	that we made his binoculars
397.447	practically optically perfect.
400.851	(Laughter)
403.328	His binoculars are one of the most
403.328	critical acting devices he has.
407.346	He doesn't have a face or even
407.346	traditional dialogue, for that matter.
410.912	So the animators were heavily
410.912	dependent on the binoculars
413.863	to sell his acting and emotions.
416.51	We started lighting and we realized
418.243	the triple lenses inside his binoculars
418.243	were a mess of reflections.
422.989	He was starting to look glassy-eyed.
425.066	(Laughter)
426.814	Now, glassy-eyed
426.814	is a fundamentally awful thing
430.252	when you are trying
430.252	to convince an audience
432.292	that a robot has a personality
432.292	and he's capable of falling in love.
436.498	So we went to work on these optically
436.498	perfect binoculars,
440.046	trying to find a solution that would
440.046	maintain his true robot materials
443.772	but solve this reflection problem.
446.096	So we started with the lenses.
447.578	Here's the flat-front lens,
448.994	we have a concave lens
450.524	and a convex lens.
451.805	And here you see all three together,
453.934	showing us all these reflections.
456.208	We tried turning them down,
457.862	we tried blocking them,
459.582	nothing was working.
461.786	You can see here,
462.961	sometimes we needed something specific
462.961	reflected in his eyes --
466.109	usually Eve.
467.284	So we couldn't just use some faked
467.284	abstract image on the lenses.
470.839	So here we have Eve on the first lens,
473.013	we put Eve on the second lens,
475.088	it's not working.
476.357	We turn it down,
477.541	it's still not working.
479.241	And then we have our eureka moment.
481.595	We add a light to WALL-E
481.595	that accidentally leaks into his eyes.
486.092	You can see it light up
486.092	these gray aperture blades.
490.237	Suddenly, those aperture blades
490.237	are poking through that reflection
493.584	the way nothing else has.
495.966	Now we recognize WALL-E as having an eye.
499.532	As humans we have the white of our eye,
502.205	the colored iris
503.38	and the black pupil.
504.948	Now WALL-E has the black of an eye,
508.313	the gray aperture blades
509.864	and the black pupil.
511.689	Suddenly, WALL-E feels like he has a soul,
515.355	like there's a character
515.355	with emotion inside.
520.038	Later in the movie towards the end,
521.879	WALL-E loses his personality,
523.381	essentially going dead.
525.381	This is the perfect time to bring back
525.381	that glassy-eyed look.
529.553	In the next scene,
529.553	WALL-E comes back to life.
532.057	We bring that light back to bring
532.057	the aperture blades back,
535.264	and he returns to that sweet,
535.264	soulful robot we've come to love.
542.444	(Video) WALL-E: Eva?
546.841	Danielle Feinberg: There's a beauty
546.841	in these unexpected moments --
549.985	when you find the key
549.985	to unlocking a robot's soul,
553.575	the moment when you discover
553.575	what you want to do with your life.
557.135	"The jellyfish in ""Finding Nemo"""
557.135	was one of those moments for me.
560.833	There are scenes in every movie
560.833	that struggle to come together.
564.076	This was one of those scenes.
566.035	The director had a vision for this scene
568.193	based on some wonderful footage
568.193	of jellyfish in the South Pacific.
573.139	As we went along,
575.02	we were floundering.
576.497	The reviews with the director
578.61	turned from the normal
578.61	look-and-feel conversation
581.323	into more and more questions
581.323	about numbers and percentages.
586.085	Maybe because unlike normal,
587.8	we were basing it on
587.8	something in real life,
590.077	or maybe just because we had lost our way.
592.686	But it had become about using
592.686	our brain without our eyes,
595.821	the science without the art.
598.251	That scientific tether
598.251	was strangling the scene.
602.534	But even through all the frustrations,
604.404	I still believed it could be beautiful.
606.463	So when it came in to lighting,
608.146	I dug in.
610.149	As I worked to balance
610.149	the blues and the pinks,
613.464	the caustics dancing
613.464	on the jellyfish bells,
616.304	the undulating fog beams,
618.502	something promising began to appear.
621.686	I came in one morning and checked
621.686	the previous night's work.
624.937	And I got excited.
626.437	And then I showed it
626.437	to the lighting director
628.569	and she got excited.
629.768	Soon, I was showing to the director
629.768	in a dark room full of 50 people.
634.563	In director review,
635.85	you hope you might get some nice words,
638.349	then you get some notes
638.349	and fixes, generally.
641.408	And then, hopefully, you get a final,
643.869	signaling to move on to the next stage.
646.462	I gave my intro, and I played
646.462	the jellyfish scene.
650.703	And the director was silent
650.703	for an uncomfortably long amount of time.
655.24	Just long enough for me to think,
657.771	"""Oh no, this is doomed."""
660.919	And then he started clapping.
663.381	And then the production
663.381	designer started clapping.
666.24	And then the whole room was clapping.
674.285	This is the moment
674.285	that I live for in lighting.
677.395	The moment where it all comes together
679.582	and we get a world that we can believe in.
682.718	We use math, science and code
682.718	to create these amazing worlds.
687.03	We use storytelling and art
687.03	to bring them to life.
690.44	It's this interweaving of art and science
694.475	that elevates the world
694.475	to a place of wonder,
698.162	a place with soul,
699.819	a place we can believe in,
702.262	a place where the things
702.262	you imagine can become real --
707.071	and a world where a girl suddenly realizes
710.307	not only is she a scientist,
712.491	but also an artist.
714.544	Thank you.
715.719	(Applause)
