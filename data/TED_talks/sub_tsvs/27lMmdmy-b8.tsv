12.637	I'm going to start with a little story.
14.092	So, I grew up in this neighborhood. When I was 15 years old,
17.204	I went from being what I think was a strapping young athlete,
21.755	over four months, slowly wasting away until
25.716	I was basically a famine victim
27.604	with an unquenchable thirst.
29.628	I had basically digested away my body.
33.237	And this all came to a head when I was on a backpacking trip,
37.531	my first one ever actually, on Old Rag Mountain
39.576	in West Virginia, and was putting my face into puddles
43.56	of water and drinking like a dog.
45.816	That night, I was taken into the emergency room
50.328	and diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic in full-blown ketoacidosis.
54.209	And I recovered, thanks to the miracles of modern medicine,
60.144	insulin and other things, and gained all my weight back and more.
65.6	And something festered inside me after this happened.
71.111	What I thought about was, what caused the diabetes?
74.624	You see, diabetes is an autoimmune disease
76.477	where your body fights itself, and at the time people thought
79.852	that somehow maybe exposure to a pathogen
82.893	had triggered my immune system to fight the pathogen
87.365	and then kill the cells that make insulin.
89.423	And this is what I thought for a long period of time,
91.733	and that's in fact what medicine and people have focused on quite a bit,
95.781	the microbes that do bad things.
98.703	And that's where I need my assistant here now.
101.771	You may recognize her.
104.209	So, I went yesterday, I apologize, I skipped a few of the talks,
109.889	and I went over to the National Academy of Sciences building,
112.13	and they sell toys, giant microbes.
117.577	And here we go!
120.962	So you have caught flesh-eating disease if you caught that one.
125.717	I gotta get back out my baseball ability here.
130.145	(Laughter)
133.852	So, unfortunately or not surprisingly, most of the microbes
140.233	they sell at the National Academy building are pathogens.
143.576	Everybody focuses on the things that kill us,
146.545	and that's what I was focusing on.
148.192	And it turns out that we are covered in a cloud of microbes,
152.753	and those microbes actually do us good much of the time,
157.273	rather than killing us.
158.393	And so, we've known about this for some period of time.
161.584	People have used microscopes to look at the microbes that cover us,
165.161	I know you're not paying attention to me, but ...
166.953	(Laughter)
169.051	The microbes that cover us.
170.993	And if you look at them in the microscope,
174.153	you can see that we actually have 10 times as many cells
177.557	of microbes on us as we have human cells.
181.025	There's more mass in the microbes than the mass of our brain.
185.776	We are literally a teeming ecosystem of microorganisms.
190.097	And unfortunately, if you want to learn about the microorganisms,
194.697	just looking at them in a microscope is not sufficient.
196.977	And so we just heard about the DNA sequencing.
199.557	It turns out that one of the best ways to look at microbes
202.085	and to understand them is to look at their DNA.
204.621	And that's what I've been doing for 20 years,
206.763	using DNA sequencing, collecting samples from various places,
210.645	including the human body, reading the DNA sequence
213.549	and then using that DNA sequencing to tell us about
216.169	the microbes that are in a particular place.
218.335	And what's amazing, when you use this technology,
221.198	for example, looking at humans, we're not just covered
224.358	in a sea of microbes.
225.494	There are thousands upon thousands of different kinds of microbes on us.
230.605	We have millions of genes of microbes in our human
235.958	microbiome covering us.
237.605	And so this microbial diversity differs between people,
241.11	and what people have been thinking about in the last 10,
244.246	maybe 15 years is, maybe these microbes,
247.366	this microbial cloud in and on us,
249.414	and the variation between us, may be responsible
253.294	for some of the health and illness differences between us.
256.864	And that comes back to the diabetes story I was telling you.
259.987	It turns out that people now think that one of the triggers
263.393	for type 1 diabetes is not fighting a pathogen,
265.774	but is in fact trying to -- miscommunicating with the microbes
270.165	that live in and on you.
271.662	And somehow maybe the microbial community that's
274.366	in and on me got off, and then this triggered some sort
278.399	of immune response and led to me killing the cells
280.638	that make insulin in my body.
282.859	And so what I want to tell you about for a few minutes is,
285.955	what people have learned using DNA sequencing techniques
289.747	in particular, to study the microbial cloud
293.406	that lives in and on us.
294.98	And I want to tell you a story about a personal project.
297.444	My first personal experience with studying the microbes
300.238	on the human body actually came from a talk that I gave,
304.388	right around the corner from here at Georgetown.
306.188	I gave a talk, and a family friend who happened to be
309.205	the Dean of Georgetown Medical School was at the talk,
311.748	and came up to me afterwards saying, they were doing
314.238	a study of ileal transplants in people.
317.588	And they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplants.
321.564	And so I started a collaboration with this person,
324.628	Michael Zasloff and Thomas Fishbein, to look at the microbes
327.901	that colonized these ilea after they were transplanted into a recipient.
332.374	And I can tell you all the details about the microbial study
335.516	that we did there, but the reason I want to tell you this story
337.766	is something really striking that they did at the beginning
340.99	of this project.
342.013	They take the donor ileum, which is filled with microbes from a donor
346.378	and they have a recipient who might have a problem
348.661	with their microbial community, say Crohn's disease,
351.286	and they sterilized the donor ileum.
354.846	Cleaned out all the microbes, and then put it in the recipient.
359.141	They did this because this was common practice
361.805	in medicine, even though it was obvious
364.934	that this was not a good idea.
367.072	And fortunately, in the course of this project,
370.077	the transplant surgeons and the other people
372.64	decided, forget common practice. We have to switch.
377.061	So they actually switched to leaving some of the microbial
381.206	community in the ileum. They leave the microbes with the donor,
385.206	and theoretically that might help the people who are
388.782	receiving this ileal transplant.
390.871	And so, people -- this is a study that I did now.
394.173	In the last few years there's been a great expansion
396.478	in using DNA technology to study the microbes in and on people.
400.656	There's something called the Human Microbiome Project
402.464	that's going on in the United States,
404.32	and MetaHIT going on in Europe, and a lot of other projects.
406.854	And when people have done a variety of studies,
410.043	they have learned things such as, when a baby is
413.675	born, during vaginal delivery you get colonized by the
416.659	microbes from your mother.
417.851	There are risk factors associated with cesarean sections,
420.907	some of those risk factors may be due to mis-colonization
424.938	when you carve a baby out of its mother
427.33	rather than being delivered through the birth canal.
430.155	And a variety of other studies have shown that the
433.604	microbial community that lives in and on us
435.411	helps in development of the immune system,
437.674	helps in fighting off pathogens, helps in our metabolism,
442.619	and determining our metabolic rate, probably
445.699	determines our odor, and may even shape our behavior
448.874	in a variety of ways.
450.81	And so, these studies have documented or suggested
453.866	out of a variety of important functions for the microbial community,
458.153	this cloud, the non-pathogens that live in and on us.
462.69	And one area that I think is very interesting,
466.274	which many of you may have now that we've thrown
468.94	"microbes into the crowd, is something that I would call ""germophobia."""
472.87	So people are really into cleanliness, right?
475.829	We have antibiotics in our kitchen counters,
477.808	people are washing every part of them all of the time,
480.904	we pump antibiotics into our food, into our communities,
485.93	we take antibiotics excessively.
488.371	And killing pathogens is a good thing if you're sick,
492.21	but we should understand that when we pump chemicals
495.474	and antibiotics into our world, that we're also killing
498.371	the cloud of microbes that live in and on us.
500.666	And excessive use of antibiotics, in particular in children,
503.666	has been shown to be associated with, again, risk factors
506.895	for obesity, for autoimmune diseases, for a variety
511.151	of problems that are probably due to disruption
513.055	of the microbial community.
516.159	So the microbial community can go wrong
519.511	whether we want it to or not,
521.223	or we can kill it with antibiotics,
523.471	but what can we do to restore it?
525.567	I'm sure many people here have heard about probiotics.
528.679	Probiotics are one thing that you can try and do to restore
531.687	the microbial community that is in and on you.
534.111	And they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases.
537.583	There's a project going on at UC Davis where people are using
540.68	probiotics to try and treat, prevent,
543.575	necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants.
546.087	Premature infants have real problems with their microbial community.
549.495	And it may be that probiotics can help prevent
552.015	the development of this horrible necrotizing enterocolitis
555.151	in these premature infants.
556.816	But probiotics are sort of a very, very simple solution.
560.807	Most of the pills that you can take or the yogurts that you can eat
564.162	have one or two species in them, maybe five species in them,
568.949	and the human community is thousands upon thousands of species.
572.615	So what can we do to restore our microbial community
576.543	when we have thousands and thousands of species on us?
579.742	Well, one thing that animals seem to do is,
582.448	they eat poo -- coprophagia.
586.462	And it turns out that many veterinarians,
591.071	old school veterinarians in particular,
593.08	"have been doing something called ""poo tea,"""
595.796	not booty, but poo tea, to treat colic and other
601.601	ailments in horses and cows and things like that,
605.224	where you make tea from the poo from a healthy
609.172	individual animal and you feed it to a sick animal.
612.321	Although, unless you have a fistulated cow with a big hole in its side,
616.761	and you can put your hand into its rumen,
619.3	it's hard to imagine that the delivery of microbes
622.708	directly into the mouth and through the entire
625.637	top of the digestive tract is the best delivery system,
629.285	so you may have heard in people they are now doing
633.405	fecal transplants, where rather than delivering
638.055	a couple of probiotic microbes through the mouth,
640.487	they are delivering a community of probiotics,
643.94	a community of microbes from a healthy donor,
646.42	through the other end.
648.557	And this has turned out to be very effective in fighting
651.887	certain intransigent infectious diseases
654.253	like Clostridium difficile infections that can stay
658.092	with people for years and years and years.
660.189	Transplants of the feces, of the microbes from the feces,
665.052	from a healthy donor has actually been shown to cure
667.917	systemic C. dif infections in some people.
670.778	Now what these transplants, these fecal transplants, or
676.62	the poo tea suggest to me, and many other people
681.079	have come up with this same idea, is that
682.823	the microbial community in and on us, it's an organ.
686.711	We should view it as a functioning organ, part of ourselves.
691.718	We should treat it carefully and with respect,
695.709	and we do not want to mess with it, say by C-sections
699.689	or by antibiotics or excessive cleanliness,
704.597	without some real good justification.
707.814	And what the DNA sequencing technologies are allowing people to do now
711.454	is do detailed studies of, say, 100 patients who have Crohn's disease
718.406	and 100 people who don't have Crohn's disease.
720.941	Or 100 people who took antibiotics when they were little,
724.774	and 100 people who did not take antibiotics.
727.198	And we can now start to compare the community of microbes
731.278	and their genes and see if there are differences.
734.581	And eventually we may be able to understand if they're not
737.983	just correlative differences, but causative.
740.607	Studies in model systems like mouse and other animals
744.077	are also helping do this, but people are now using
747.286	these technologies because they've gotten very cheap,
749.59	to study the microbes in and on a variety of people.
753.504	So, in wrapping up, what I want to tell you about is,
758.094	I didn't tell you a part of the story of coming down with diabetes.
761.301	It turns out that my father was an M.D.,
764.065	actually studied hormones. I told him many times
768.537	that I was tired, thirsty, not feeling very good.
773.327	And he shrugged it off, I think he either thought
776.206	I was just complaining a lot, or it was the typical
779.485	"M.D. ""nothing can be wrong with my children."""
782.104	We even went to the International Society of Endocrinology
785.325	meeting as family in Quebec.
787.455	And I was getting up every five minutes to pee,
792.949	and drinking everybody's water at the table,
795.384	and I think they all thought I was a druggie.
798.318	(Laughter)
800.038	But the reason I'm telling you this is that
802.014	the medical community, my father as an example,
805.014	sometimes doesn't see what's right in front of their eyes.
808.581	The microbial cloud, it is right in front of us.
812.566	We can't see it most of the time. It's invisible.
815.366	They're microbes. They're tiny.
816.837	But we can see them through their DNA,
819.789	we can see them through the effects that they have on people.
823.038	And what we need now
824.656	is to start thinking about this microbial community in the context
828.325	of everything in human medicine.
830.838	It doesn't mean that it affects every part of us,
833.905	but it might.
835.304	What we need is a full field guide to the microbes
839.229	that live in and on people, so that we can understand
842.622	what they're doing to our lives.
845.894	We are them. They are us.
848.965	Thank you.
850.293	(Applause)
