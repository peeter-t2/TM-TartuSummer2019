15.26	My subject today is learning.
18.26	And in that spirit, I want to spring on you all a pop quiz.
21.26	Ready?
23.26	When does learning begin?
26.26	Now as you ponder that question,
28.26	maybe you're thinking about the first day of preschool
30.26	or kindergarten,
32.26	the first time that kids are in a classroom with a teacher.
35.26	Or maybe you've called to mind the toddler phase
38.26	when children are learning how to walk and talk
41.26	and use a fork.
43.26	Maybe you've encountered the Zero-to-Three movement,
46.26	which asserts that the most important years for learning
49.26	are the earliest ones.
51.26	And so your answer to my question would be:
54.26	Learning begins at birth.
56.26	Well today I want to present to you
58.26	an idea that may be surprising
61.26	and may even seem implausible,
64.26	but which is supported by the latest evidence
66.26	from psychology and biology.
69.26	And that is that some of the most important learning we ever do
72.26	happens before we're born,
74.26	while we're still in the womb.
77.26	Now I'm a science reporter.
79.26	I write books and magazine articles.
81.26	And I'm also a mother.
83.26	And those two roles came together for me
86.26	"in a book that I wrote called ""Origins."""
89.26	"""Origins"" is a report from the front lines"
92.26	of an exciting new field
94.26	called fetal origins.
96.26	Fetal origins is a scientific discipline
99.26	that emerged just about two decades ago,
102.26	and it's based on the theory
105.26	that our health and well-being throughout our lives
108.26	is crucially affected
110.26	by the nine months we spend in the womb.
113.26	Now this theory was of more than just intellectual interest to me.
117.26	I was myself pregnant
119.26	while I was doing the research for the book.
122.26	And one of the most fascinating insights
124.26	I took from this work
126.26	is that we're all learning about the world
129.26	even before we enter it.
132.26	When we hold our babies for the first time,
134.26	we might imagine that they're clean slates,
137.26	unmarked by life,
139.26	when in fact, they've already been shaped by us
142.26	and by the particular world we live in.
146.26	Today I want to share with you some of the amazing things
148.26	that scientists are discovering
150.26	about what fetuses learn
152.26	while they're still in their mothers' bellies.
156.26	First of all,
158.26	they learn the sound of their mothers' voices.
161.26	Because sounds from the outside world
164.26	have to travel through the mother's abdominal tissue
167.26	and through the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus,
171.26	the voices fetuses hear,
173.26	starting around the fourth month of gestation,
176.26	are muted and muffled.
178.26	One researcher says
180.26	that they probably sound a lot like the the voice of Charlie Brown's teacher
183.26	"in the old ""Peanuts"" cartoon."
186.26	But the pregnant woman's own voice
189.26	reverberates through her body,
191.26	reaching the fetus much more readily.
194.26	And because the fetus is with her all the time,
197.26	it hears her voice a lot.
200.26	Once the baby's born, it recognizes her voice
203.26	and it prefers listening to her voice
205.26	over anyone else's.
207.26	How can we know this?
209.26	Newborn babies can't do much,
211.26	but one thing they're really good at is sucking.
214.26	Researchers take advantage of this fact
217.26	by rigging up two rubber nipples,
220.26	so that if a baby sucks on one,
222.26	it hears a recording of its mother's voice
224.26	on a pair of headphones,
226.26	and if it sucks on the other nipple,
228.26	it hears a recording of a female stranger's voice.
232.26	Babies quickly show their preference
235.26	by choosing the first one.
238.26	Scientists also take advantage of the fact
241.26	that babies will slow down their sucking
243.26	when something interests them
245.26	and resume their fast sucking
247.26	when they get bored.
250.26	This is how researchers discovered
252.26	that, after women repeatedly read aloud
255.26	"a section of Dr. Seuss' ""The Cat in the Hat"" while they were pregnant,"
259.26	their newborn babies recognized that passage
262.26	when they hear it outside the womb.
265.26	My favorite experiment of this kind
268.26	is the one that showed that the babies
270.26	of women who watched a certain soap opera
272.26	every day during pregnancy
275.26	recognized the theme song of that show
278.26	once they were born.
281.26	So fetuses are even learning
283.26	about the particular language that's spoken
286.26	in the world that they'll be born into.
288.26	A study published last year
291.26	found that from birth, from the moment of birth,
294.26	babies cry in the accent
296.26	of their mother's native language.
299.26	French babies cry on a rising note
302.26	while German babies end on a falling note,
305.26	imitating the melodic contours
307.26	of those languages.
309.26	Now why would this kind of fetal learning
311.26	be useful?
313.26	It may have evolved to aid the baby's survival.
316.26	From the moment of birth,
318.26	the baby responds most to the voice
320.26	of the person who is most likely to care for it --
322.26	its mother.
324.26	It even makes its cries
326.26	sound like the mother's language,
328.26	which may further endear the baby to the mother,
331.26	and which may give the baby a head start
333.26	in the critical task
335.26	of learning how to understand and speak
338.26	its native language.
340.26	But it's not just sounds
342.26	that fetuses are learning about in utero.
344.26	It's also tastes and smells.
347.26	By seven months of gestation,
349.26	the fetus' taste buds are fully developed,
351.26	and its olfactory receptors, which allow it to smell,
354.26	are functioning.
356.26	The flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats
359.26	find their way into the amniotic fluid,
361.26	which is continuously swallowed
363.26	by the fetus.
365.26	Babies seem to remember and prefer these tastes
368.26	once they're out in the world.
371.26	In one experiment, a group of pregnant women
374.26	was asked to drink a lot of carrot juice
376.26	during their third trimester of pregnancy,
379.26	while another group of pregnant women
381.26	drank only water.
383.26	Six months later, the women's infants
386.26	were offered cereal mixed with carrot juice,
389.26	and their facial expressions were observed while they ate it.
393.26	The offspring of the carrot juice drinking women
395.26	ate more carrot-flavored cereal,
397.26	and from the looks of it,
399.26	they seemed to enjoy it more.
401.26	A sort of French version of this experiment
404.26	was carried out in Dijon, France
406.26	where researchers found
408.26	that mothers who consumed food and drink
411.26	flavored with licorice-flavored anise during pregnancy
416.26	showed a preference for anise
418.26	on their first day of life,
420.26	and again, when they were tested later,
422.26	on their fourth day of life.
424.26	Babies whose mothers did not eat anise during pregnancy
428.26	"showed a reaction that translated roughly as ""yuck."""
432.26	What this means
434.26	is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers
436.26	about what is safe and good to eat.
439.26	Fetuses are also being taught
441.26	about the particular culture that they'll be joining
444.26	through one of culture's most powerful expressions,
447.26	which is food.
449.26	They're being introduced to the characteristic flavors and spices
452.26	of their culture's cuisine
454.26	even before birth.
457.26	Now it turns out that fetuses are learning even bigger lessons.
460.26	But before I get to that,
462.26	I want to address something that you may be wondering about.
466.26	The notion of fetal learning
468.26	may conjure up for you attempts to enrich the fetus --
471.26	like playing Mozart through headphones
473.26	placed on a pregnant belly.
475.26	But actually, the nine-month-long process
478.26	of molding and shaping that goes on in the womb
481.26	is a lot more visceral and consequential than that.
485.26	Much of what a pregnant woman encounters in her daily life --
489.26	the air she breathes,
491.26	the food and drink she consumes,
493.26	the chemicals she's exposed to,
495.26	even the emotions she feels --
497.26	are shared in some fashion with her fetus.
500.26	They make up a mix of influences
503.26	as individual and idiosyncratic
505.26	as the woman herself.
507.26	The fetus incorporates these offerings
509.26	into its own body,
511.26	makes them part of its flesh and blood.
514.26	And often it does something more.
516.26	It treats these maternal contributions
519.26	as information,
521.26	as what I like to call biological postcards
523.26	from the world outside.
526.26	So what a fetus is learning about in utero
529.26	"is not Mozart's ""Magic Flute"""
531.26	but answers to questions much more critical to its survival.
535.26	Will it be born into a world of abundance
537.26	or scarcity?
539.26	Will it be safe and protected,
542.26	or will it face constant dangers and threats?
545.26	Will it live a long, fruitful life
547.26	or a short, harried one?
550.26	The pregnant woman's diet and stress level in particular
553.26	provide important clues to prevailing conditions
556.26	like a finger lifted to the wind.
559.26	The resulting tuning and tweaking
561.26	of a fetus' brain and other organs
564.26	are part of what give us humans
566.26	our enormous flexibility,
568.26	our ability to thrive
570.26	in a huge variety of environments,
572.26	from the country to the city,
574.26	from the tundra to the desert.
577.26	To conclude, I want to tell you two stories
579.26	about how mothers teach their children about the world
582.26	even before they're born.
586.26	In the autumn of 1944,
588.26	the darkest days of World War II,
591.26	German troops blockaded Western Holland,
594.26	turning away all shipments of food.
597.26	The opening of the Nazi's siege
599.26	was followed by one of the harshest winters in decades --
602.26	so cold the water in the canals froze solid.
606.26	Soon food became scarce,
608.26	with many Dutch surviving on just 500 calories a day --
612.26	a quarter of what they consumed before the war.
615.26	As weeks of deprivation stretched into months,
618.26	some resorted to eating tulip bulbs.
621.26	By the beginning of May,
623.26	the nation's carefully rationed food reserve
625.26	was completely exhausted.
627.26	The specter of mass starvation loomed.
630.26	And then on May 5th, 1945,
633.26	the siege came to a sudden end
635.26	when Holland was liberated
637.26	by the Allies.
639.26	"The ""Hunger Winter,"" as it came to be known,"
642.26	killed some 10,000 people
644.26	and weakened thousands more.
646.26	But there was another population that was affected --
649.26	the 40,000 fetuses
651.26	in utero during the siege.
654.26	Some of the effects of malnutrition during pregnancy
656.26	were immediately apparent
658.26	in higher rates of stillbirths,
660.26	birth defects, low birth weights
662.26	and infant mortality.
664.26	But others wouldn't be discovered for many years.
667.26	"Decades after the ""Hunger Winter,"""
669.26	researchers documented
671.26	that people whose mothers were pregnant during the siege
675.26	have more obesity, more diabetes
677.26	and more heart disease in later life
680.26	than individuals who were gestated under normal conditions.
683.26	These individuals' prenatal experience of starvation
687.26	seems to have changed their bodies
689.26	in myriad ways.
691.26	They have higher blood pressure,
693.26	poorer cholesterol profiles
695.26	and reduced glucose tolerance --
697.26	a precursor of diabetes.
700.26	Why would undernutrition in the womb
702.26	result in disease later?
704.26	One explanation
706.26	is that fetuses are making the best of a bad situation.
709.26	When food is scarce,
711.26	they divert nutrients towards the really critical organ, the brain,
714.26	and away from other organs
716.26	like the heart and liver.
718.26	This keeps the fetus alive in the short-term,
721.26	but the bill comes due later on in life
724.26	when those other organs, deprived early on,
726.26	become more susceptible to disease.
729.26	But that may not be all that's going on.
732.26	It seems that fetuses are taking cues
734.26	from the intrauterine environment
737.26	and tailoring their physiology accordingly.
739.26	They're preparing themselves
741.26	for the kind of world they will encounter
743.26	on the other side of the womb.
745.26	The fetus adjusts its metabolism
747.26	and other physiological processes
750.26	in anticipation of the environment that awaits it.
753.26	And the basis of the fetus' prediction
756.26	is what its mother eats.
758.26	The meals a pregnant woman consumes
760.26	constitute a kind of story,
762.26	a fairy tale of abundance
764.26	or a grim chronicle of deprivation.
767.26	This story imparts information
770.26	that the fetus uses
772.26	to organize its body and its systems --
774.26	an adaptation to prevailing circumstances
777.26	that facilitates its future survival.
780.26	Faced with severely limited resources,
783.26	a smaller-sized child with reduced energy requirements
786.26	will, in fact, have a better chance
788.26	of living to adulthood.
790.26	The real trouble comes
792.26	when pregnant women are, in a sense, unreliable narrators,
795.26	when fetuses are led
797.26	to expect a world of scarcity
799.26	and are born instead into a world of plenty.
802.26	"This is what happened to the children of the Dutch ""Hunger Winter."""
805.26	And their higher rates of obesity,
807.26	diabetes and heart disease
809.26	are the result.
811.26	Bodies that were built to hang onto every calorie
814.26	found themselves swimming in the superfluous calories
816.26	of the post-war Western diet.
819.26	The world they had learned about while in utero
822.26	was not the same
824.26	as the world into which they were born.
827.26	Here's another story.
829.26	At 8:46 a.m. on September 11th, 2001,
833.26	there were tens of thousands of people
835.26	in the vicinity of the World Trade Center
837.26	in New York --
839.26	commuters spilling off trains,
841.26	waitresses setting tables for the morning rush,
844.26	brokers already working the phones on Wall Street.
848.26	1,700 of these people were pregnant women.
851.26	When the planes struck and the towers collapsed,
854.26	many of these women experienced the same horrors
857.26	inflicted on other survivors of the disaster --
860.26	the overwhelming chaos and confusion,
862.26	the rolling clouds
864.26	of potentially toxic dust and debris,
868.26	the heart-pounding fear for their lives.
870.26	About a year after 9/11,
872.26	researchers examined a group of women
875.26	who were pregnant
877.26	when they were exposed to the World Trade Center attack.
879.26	In the babies of those women
881.26	who developed post-traumatic stress syndrome, or PTSD,
884.26	following their ordeal,
886.26	researchers discovered a biological marker
889.26	of susceptibility to PTSD --
891.26	an effect that was most pronounced
894.26	in infants whose mothers experienced the catastrophe
897.26	in their third trimester.
899.26	In other words,
901.26	the mothers with post-traumatic stress syndrome
904.26	had passed on a vulnerability to the condition
907.26	to their children while they were still in utero.
910.26	Now consider this:
912.26	post-traumatic stress syndrome
914.26	appears to be a reaction to stress gone very wrong,
917.26	causing its victims tremendous unnecessary suffering.
921.26	But there's another way of thinking about PTSD.
924.26	What looks like pathology to us
927.26	may actually be a useful adaptation
929.26	in some circumstances.
931.26	In a particularly dangerous environment,
934.26	the characteristic manifestations of PTSD --
937.26	a hyper-awareness of one's surroundings,
940.26	a quick-trigger response to danger --
943.26	could save someone's life.
946.26	The notion that the prenatal transmission of PTSD risk is adaptive
950.26	is still speculative,
952.26	but I find it rather poignant.
955.26	It would mean that, even before birth,
957.26	mothers are warning their children
959.26	that it's a wild world out there,
961.26	"telling them, ""Be careful."""
964.26	Let me be clear.
966.26	Fetal origins research is not about blaming women
969.26	for what happens during pregnancy.
971.26	It's about discovering how best to promote
974.26	the health and well-being of the next generation.
977.26	That important effort must include a focus
979.26	on what fetuses learn
981.26	during the nine months they spend in the womb.
984.26	Learning is one of life's most essential activities,
987.26	and it begins much earlier
989.26	than we ever imagined.
991.26	Thank you.
993.26	(Applause)
