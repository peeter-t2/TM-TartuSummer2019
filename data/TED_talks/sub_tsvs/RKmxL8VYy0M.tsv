15.931	Hi. So, this chap here,
18.716	he thinks he can tell you the future.
20.978	His name is Nostradamus, although here the Sun have
22.957	made him look a little bit like Sean Connery. (Laughter)
26.627	And like most of you, I suspect, I don't really believe
29.53	that people can see into the future.
30.638	I don't believe in precognition, and every now and then,
33.342	you hear that somebody has been able to predict something that happened in the future,
36.524	and that's probably because it was a fluke, and we only
39.583	hear about the flukes and about the freaks.
42.198	We don't hear about all the times that people got stuff wrong.
46.277	Now we expect that to happen with silly stories
48.437	about precognition, but the problem is,
51.576	we have exactly the same problem in academia
54.92	and in medicine, and in this environment, it costs lives.
59.421	So firstly, thinking just about precognition, as it turns out,
62.786	just last year a researcher called Daryl Bem conducted
65.315	a piece of research where he found evidence
67.151	of precognitive powers in undergraduate students,
70.809	and this was published in a peer-reviewed academic journal
73.383	"and most of the people who read this just said, ""Okay, well,"
75.664	fair enough, but I think that's a fluke, that's a freak, because I know
77.845	that if I did a study where I found no evidence
80.679	that undergraduate students had precognitive powers,
83.191	it probably wouldn't get published in a journal.
86.743	And in fact, we know that that's true, because
89.598	several different groups of research scientists tried
92.127	to replicate the findings of this precognition study,
95.647	and when they submitted it to the exact same journal,
98.282	"the journal said, ""No, we're not interested in publishing"
101.434	"replication. We're not interested in your negative data."""
105.959	So this is already evidence of how, in the academic
108.713	literature, we will see a biased sample of the true picture
113.583	of all of the scientific studies that have been conducted.
117.05	But it doesn't just happen in the dry academic field of psychology.
121.479	It also happens in, for example, cancer research.
125.846	So in March, 2012, just one month ago, some researchers
129.923	reported in the journal Nature how they had tried
132.819	to replicate 53 different basic science studies looking at
136.665	potential treatment targets in cancer,
140.22	and out of those 53 studies, they were only able
142.858	to successfully replicate six.
145.934	Forty-seven out of those 53 were unreplicable.
150.267	And they say in their discussion that this is very likely
154.18	because freaks get published.
156.819	People will do lots and lots and lots of different studies,
158.915	and the occasions when it works they will publish,
161.035	and the ones where it doesn't work they won't.
162.714	And their first recommendation of how to fix this problem,
166.655	because it is a problem, because it sends us all down blind alleys,
169.944	their first recommendation of how to fix this problem
171.65	is to make it easier to publish negative results in science,
175.043	and to change the incentives so that scientists are
177.95	encouraged to post more of their negative results in public.
182.302	But it doesn't just happen in the very dry world
186.154	of preclinical basic science cancer research.
190.005	It also happens in the very real, flesh and blood
193.662	of academic medicine. So in 1980,
197.253	some researchers did a study on a drug called lorcainide,
200.261	and this was an anti-arrhythmic drug,
202.592	a drug that suppresses abnormal heart rhythms,
204.858	and the idea was, after people have had a heart attack,
207.086	they're quite likely to have abnormal heart rhythms,
208.623	so if we give them a drug that suppresses abnormal heart
211	rhythms, this will increase the chances of them surviving.
214.713	Early on its development, they did a very small trial,
217.721	just under a hundred patients.
219.365	Fifty patients got lorcainide, and of those patients, 10 died.
223.017	Another 50 patients got a dummy placebo sugar pill
226.06	with no active ingredient, and only one of them died.
229.018	So they rightly regarded this drug as a failure,
231.667	and its commercial development was stopped, and because
234.536	its commercial development was stopped, this trial was never published.
238.884	Unfortunately, over the course of the next five, 10 years,
244.281	other companies had the same idea about drugs that would
248.106	prevent arrhythmias in people who have had heart attacks.
250.698	These drugs were brought to market. They were prescribed
252.418	very widely because heart attacks are a very common thing,
255.83	and it took so long for us to find out that these drugs
259.673	also caused an increased rate of death
262.584	that before we detected that safety signal,
265.331	over 100,000 people died unnecessarily in America
271.382	from the prescription of anti-arrhythmic drugs.
274.833	Now actually, in 1993,
278.431	the researchers who did that 1980 study, that early study,
281.991	published a mea culpa, an apology to the scientific community,
285.832	"in which they said, ""When we carried out our study in 1980,"
288.957	we thought that the increased death rate that occurred
290.893	"in the lorcainide group was an effect of chance."""
294.251	The development of lorcainide was abandoned for commercial reasons,
296.283	and this study was never published;
297.921	it's now a good example of publication bias.
300.307	That's the technical term for the phenomenon where
302.198	unflattering data gets lost, gets unpublished, is left
306.436	missing in action, and they say the results described here
309.807	"""might have provided an early warning of trouble ahead."""
314.615	Now these are stories from basic science.
317.828	These are stories from 20, 30 years ago.
322.615	The academic publishing environment is very different now.
325.762	"There are academic journals like ""Trials,"" the open access journal,"
329.757	which will publish any trial conducted in humans
332.412	regardless of whether it has a positive or a negative result.
335.715	But this problem of negative results that go missing in action
339.684	is still very prevalent. In fact it's so prevalent
343.243	that it cuts to the core of evidence-based medicine.
349.094	So this is a drug called reboxetine, and this is a drug
352.109	that I myself have prescribed. It's an antidepressant.
354.644	And I'm a very nerdy doctor, so I read all of the studies
357.18	that I could on this drug. I read the one study that was published
360.232	that showed that reboxetine was better than placebo,
363.179	and I read the other three studies that were published
365.043	that showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other antidepressant,
368.614	and because this patient hadn't done well on those other antidepressants,
370.801	I thought, well, reboxetine is just as good. It's one to try.
373.267	But it turned out that I was misled. In fact,
376.659	seven trials were conducted comparing reboxetine
379.108	against a dummy placebo sugar pill. One of them
381.82	was positive and that was published, but six of them
384.132	were negative and they were left unpublished.
388.18	Three trials were published comparing reboxetine
389.919	against other antidepressants in which reboxetine
392.145	was just as good, and they were published,
393.938	but three times as many patients' worth of data was collected
398.327	which showed that reboxetine was worse than
400.198	those other treatments, and those trials were not published.
404.899	I felt misled.
408.658	Now you might say, well, that's an extremely unusual example,
410.788	and I wouldn't want to be guilty of the same kind of
412.796	cherry-picking and selective referencing
415.777	that I'm accusing other people of.
417.568	But it turns out that this phenomenon of publication bias
419.452	has actually been very, very well studied.
421.579	So here is one example of how you approach it.
423.797	The classic model is, you get a bunch of studies where
426.237	you know that they've been conducted and completed,
428.422	and then you go and see if they've been published anywhere
430.743	in the academic literature. So this took all of the trials
433.606	that had ever been conducted on antidepressants
435.76	that were approved over a 15-year period by the FDA.
439.402	They took all of the trials which were submitted to the FDA as part of the approval package.
443.158	So that's not all of the trials that were ever conducted on these drugs,
446.358	because we can never know if we have those,
448.456	but it is the ones that were conducted in order to get the marketing authorization.
451.95	And then they went to see if these trials had been published
454.299	in the peer-reviewed academic literature. And this is what they found.
456.871	It was pretty much a 50-50 split. Half of these trials
460.04	were positive, half of them were negative, in reality.
463.637	But when they went to look for these trials in the peer-reviewed academic literature,
468.378	what they found was a very different picture.
470.612	Only three of the negative trials were published,
474.984	but all but one of the positive trials were published.
479.626	Now if we just flick back and forth between those two,
483.387	you can see what a staggering difference there was
485.981	between reality and what doctors, patients,
489.431	commissioners of health services, and academics
492.053	were able to see in the peer-reviewed academic literature.
495.334	We were misled, and this is a systematic flaw
499.788	in the core of medicine.
503.118	In fact, there have been so many studies conducted on
505.781	publication bias now, over a hundred, that they've been
509.165	collected in a systematic review, published in 2010,
512.359	that took every single study on publication bias
515.125	that they could find.
516.424	Publication bias affects every field of medicine.
519.276	About half of all trials, on average, go missing in action,
523.589	and we know that positive findings are around twice as likely
526.647	to be published as negative findings.
529.701	This is a cancer at the core of evidence-based medicine.
533.762	If I flipped a coin 100 times but then
537.633	withheld the results from you from half of those tosses,
540.892	I could make it look as if I had a coin that always came up heads.
544.292	But that wouldn't mean that I had a two-headed coin.
546.113	That would mean that I was a chancer
547.825	and you were an idiot for letting me get away with it. (Laughter)
550.939	But this is exactly what we blindly tolerate
554.576	in the whole of evidence-based medicine.
558.365	And to me, this is research misconduct.
562.797	If I conducted one study and I withheld
565.54	half of the data points from that one study,
568.54	you would rightly accuse me, essentially, of research fraud.
573.247	And yet, for some reason, if somebody conducts
580.588	we don't consider that to be research misconduct.
583.376	And when that responsibility is diffused between
585.943	a whole network of researchers, academics,
589.104	industry sponsors, journal editors, for some reason
592.632	we find it more acceptable,
594.085	but the effect on patients is damning.
597.76	And this is happening right now, today.
602.778	This is a drug called Tamiflu. Tamiflu is a drug
605.489	which governments around the world have spent billions
608.085	and billions of dollars on stockpiling,
610.657	and we've stockpiled Tamiflu in panic,
613.805	in the belief that it will reduce the rate of complications of influenza.
617.754	Complications is a medical euphemism for pneumonia
620.438	and death. (Laughter)
625.252	Now when the Cochrane systematic reviewers
628.46	were trying to collect together all of the data from all
630.985	of the trials that had ever been conducted on whether Tamiflu actually did this or not,
634.633	they found that several of those trials were unpublished.
637.584	The results were unavailable to them.
639.426	And when they started obtaining the writeups of those trials through various different means,
643.39	through Freedom of Information Act requests, through
645.072	harassing various different organizations, what they found was inconsistent.
649.881	And when they tried to get a hold of the clinical study reports,
652.347	the 10,000-page long documents that have
655.393	the best possible rendition of the information,
658.993	they were told they weren't allowed to have them.
661.881	And if you want to read the full correspondence
664.564	and the excuses and the explanations given by the drug company,
667.854	you can see that written up in this week's edition
670.571	of PLOS Medicine.
674.938	And the most staggering thing of all of this, to me,
678.797	is that not only is this a problem, not only do we recognize
682.096	that this is a problem, but we've had to suffer fake fixes.
686.291	We've had people pretend that this is a problem that's been fixed.
689.349	First of all, we had trials registers, and everybody said,
691.537	oh, it's okay. We'll get everyone to register their trials, they'll post the protocol,
695.14	they'll say what they're going to do before they do it,
697.164	and then afterwards we'll be able to check and see if all the trials which
699.285	have been conducted and completed have been published.
701.753	But people didn't bother to use those registers.
703.949	And so then the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors came along,
706.568	and they said, oh, well, we will hold the line.
708.111	We won't publish any journals, we won't publish any trials,
710.744	unless they've been registered before they began.
713.426	But they didn't hold the line. In 2008, a study was conducted
716.957	which showed that half of all of trials published by journals
719.972	edited by members of the ICMJE
722.639	weren't properly registered, and a quarter of them weren't registered at all.
727.452	And then finally, the FDA Amendment Act was passed
730.253	a couple of years ago saying that everybody who conducts
732.602	a trial must post the results of that trial within one year.
736.045	And in the BMJ, in the first edition of January, 2012,
740.141	you can see a study which looks to see if people kept
742.845	to that ruling, and it turns out that only one in five
746.564	have done so.
749.428	This is a disaster.
752.711	We cannot know the true effects of the medicines
756.275	that we prescribe if we do not have access
759.491	to all of the information.
762.671	And this is not a difficult problem to fix.
766.63	We need to force people to publish all trials
771.758	conducted in humans, including the older trials,
774.729	because the FDA Amendment Act only asks that you publish the trials conducted after 2008,
778.674	and I don't know what world it is in which we're only
781.287	practicing medicine on the basis of trials that completed in the past two years.
785.743	We need to publish all trials in humans,
787.848	including the older trials, for all drugs in current use,
790.922	and you need to tell everyone you know
793.838	that this is a problem and that it has not been fixed.
797.28	Thank you very much. (Applause)
800.231	(Applause)
