12.462	I am a Hazara,
14.552	and the homeland
14.552	of my people is Afghanistan.
19.381	Like hundreds of thousands
19.381	of other Hazara kids,
22.4	I was born in exile.
25.164	The ongoing persecution
25.164	and operation against the Hazaras
29.366	forced my parents to leave Afghanistan.
33.963	This persecution has had a long history
33.963	going back to the late 1800s,
38.374	and the rule of King Abdur Rahman.
41.301	He killed 63 percent of 
41.301	the Hazara population.
46.897	He built minarets with their heads.
49.544	Many Hazaras were sold into slavery,
51.911	and many others fled the country
51.911	for neighboring Iran and Pakistan.
58.204	My parents also fled to Pakistan,
60.92	and settled in Quetta, where I was born.
63.916	After the September 11
63.916	attack on the Twin Towers,
66.857	I got a chance to go to Afghanistan
68.645	for the first time,
68.645	with foreign journalists.
71.223	I was only 18, and I got a job
71.223	working as an interpreter.
75.03	After four years,
77.213	I felt it was safe enough
77.213	to move to Afghanistan permanently,
81.903	and I was working there
81.903	as a documentary photographer,
86.523	and I worked on many stories.
90.769	One of the most important
90.769	stories that I did
93.373	was the dancing boys of Afghanistan.
98.087	It is a tragic story about
98.087	an appalling tradition.
102.591	It involves young kids
102.591	dancing for warlords
106.052	and powerful men in the society.
108.141	These boys are often abducted
108.141	or bought from their poor parents,
111.902	and they are put to work as sex slaves.
114.967	This is Shukur.
117.731	He was kidnapped from Kabul by a warlord.
121.4	He was taken to another province,
123.372	where he was forced to work as a sex slave
123.372	for the warlord and his friends.
128.133	When this story was published
128.133	in the Washington Post,
131.058	I started receiving death threats,
133.38	and I was forced to leave Afghanistan,
137.118	as my parents were.
139.51	Along with my family,
139.51	I returned back to Quetta.
143.202	The situation in Quetta had changed
143.202	dramatically since I left in 2005.
147.614	Once a peaceful haven for the Hazaras,
150.167	it had now turned into the most
150.167	dangerous city in Pakistan.
155.601	Hazaras are confined into two small areas,
159.176	and they are marginalized socially,
159.176	educationally, and financially.
164.029	This is Nadir.
165.469	I had known him since my childhood.
167.466	He was injured when his van
167.466	was ambushed by terrorists in Quetta.
171.645	He later died of his injuries.
175.221	Around 1,600 Hazara members
179.006	had been killed in various attacks,
182.629	and around 3,000 of them were injured,
187.527	and many of them permanently disabled.
190.778	The attacks on the Hazara community
190.778	would only get worse,
194.076	so it was not surprising
194.076	that many wanted to flee.
196.908	After Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan,
201.668	Australia is home to the fourth largest
201.668	population of Hazaras in the world.
208.332	When it came time to leave Pakistan,
211.141	Australia seemed the obvious choice.
213.091	Financially, only one of us could leave,
215.088	and it was decided that I would go,
216.946	in the hope that if I arrived
216.946	at my destination safely,
220.299	I could work to get the rest
220.299	of my family to join me later.
225.291	We all knew about the risks,
226.87	and how terrifying the journey is,
229.842	and I met many people
229.842	who lost loved ones at sea.
234.416	It was a desperate decision to take,
234.416	to leave everything behind,
238.805	and no one makes this decision easily.
241.68	If I had been able
241.68	to simply fly to Australia,
243.866	it would have taken me
243.866	less than 24 hours.
246.49	But getting a visa was impossible.
250.576	My journey was much longer,
252.689	much more complicated,
254.943	and certainly more dangerous,
257.989	traveling to Thailand by air,
260.631	and then by road and boat
260.631	to Malaysia and into Indonesia,
265.429	paying people and smugglers all the way
267.844	and spending a lot of time hiding
270.584	and a lot of time in fear of being caught.
274.3	In Indonesia, I joined a group
274.3	of seven asylum seekers.
278.687	We all shared a bedroom
281.241	in a town outside of Jakarta called Bogor.
285.119	After spending a week in Bogor,
287.419	three of my roommates
287.419	left for the perilous journey,
290.868	and we got the news two days later
294.7	that a distressed boat sank
294.7	in the sea en route to Christmas Island.
299.506	We found out that our three roommates --
299.506	Nawroz, Jaffar and Shabbir --
303.267	were also among those.
305.218	Only Jaffar was rescued.
307.656	Shabbir and Nawroz were never seen again.
311.249	It made me think,
312.898	am I doing the right thing?
315.568	I concluded I really had
315.568	no other choice but to go on.
319.515	A few weeks later, we got the call
319.515	from the people smuggler
323.37	to alert us that the boat is ready for us
323.37	to commence our sea journey.
328.06	Taken in the night towards the main vessel
330.94	on a motorboat,
332.588	we boarded an old fishing boat
332.588	that was already overloaded.
337.603	There were 93 of us,
339.693	and we were all below deck.
341.666	No one was allowed up on the top.
343.919	We all paid 6,000 dollars each
347.077	for this part of the trip.
349.166	The first night and day went smoothly,
351.395	but by the second night, 
351.395	the weather turned.
354.623	Waves tossed the boat around,
354.623	and the timbers groaned.
359.568	People below deck were crying,
359.568	praying, recalling their loved ones.
363.91	They were screaming.
365.652	It was a terrible moment.
367.811	It was like a scene from doomsday,
371.758	or maybe like one of those scenes
371.758	from those Hollywood movies
376.583	that shows that everything
376.583	is breaking apart
379.788	and the world is just ending.
382.225	It was happening to us for real.
384.849	We didn't have any hope.
389.192	Our boat was floating
389.192	like a matchbox on the water
392.72	without any control.
394.856	The waves were much higher than our boat,
398.618	and the water poured in faster
398.618	than the motor pumps could take it out.
404.655	We all lost hope.
407.511	We thought, this is the end.
409.95	We were watching our deaths,
411.876	and I was documenting it.
414.268	The captain told us
416.219	that we are not going to make it,
418.586	we have to turn back the boat.
421.767	We went on the deck
423.834	and turned our torches on and off
426.366	to attract the attention
426.366	of any passing boat.
431.265	We kept trying to attract their attention
431.265	by waving our life jackets and whistling.
438.649	Eventually, we made it to a small island.
442.084	Our boat crashing onto the rocks,
445.335	I slipped into the water
447.378	and destroyed my camera,
447.378	whatever I had documented.
451.025	But luckily, the memory card survived.
456.791	It was a thick forest.
459.206	We all split up into many groups
459.206	as we argued over what to do next.
464.965	We were all scared and confused.
467.333	Then, after spending
467.333	the night on the beach,
470.63	we found a jetty and coconuts.
473.253	We hailed a boat from a nearby resort,
476.249	and then were quickly handed over
476.249	to Indonesian water police.
480.498	At Serang Detention Center,
484.1	an immigration officer came
484.1	and furtively strip-searched us.
489.158	He took our mobile, my $300 cash,
492.526	our shoes that we should not
492.526	be able to escape,
495.938	but we kept watching the guards,
495.938	checking their movements,
501.999	and around 4 a.m.
501.999	when they sat around a fire,
505.842	we removed two glass layers
505.842	from an outside facing window
509.396	and slipped through.
510.915	We climbed a tree next to an outer wall
510.915	that was topped with the shards of glass.
515.744	We put the pillow on that
518.043	and wrapped our forearms with bedsheets
521.573	and climbed the wall,
523.671	and we ran away with bare feet.
527.418	I was free,
529.207	with an uncertain future,
531.924	no money.
533.734	The only thing I had was the memory card
533.734	with the pictures and footage.
540.858	When my documentary was aired
540.858	on SBS Dateline,
544.275	many of my friends came to know
544.275	about my situation,
546.854	and they tried to help me.
548.71	They did not allow me to take
548.71	any other boat to risk my life.
552.448	I also decided to stay in Indonesia
552.448	and process my case through UNHCR,
556.953	but I was really afraid
556.953	that I would end up in Indonesia
560.807	for many years doing nothing
560.807	and unable to work,
564.461	like every other asylum seeker.
567.706	But it had happened to be
567.706	a little bit different with me.
570.93	I was lucky.
575.923	My contacts worked to expedite
575.923	my case through UNHCR,
580.381	and I got resettled
580.381	in Australia in May 2013.
585.119	Not every asylum seeker is lucky like me.
589.298	It is really difficult to live a life
589.298	with an uncertain fate, in limbo.
596.588	The issue of asylum seekers in Australia
600.419	has been so extremely politicized
603.137	that it has lost its human face.
606.271	The asylum seekers have been demonized
606.271	and then presented to the people.
612.372	I hope my story and the story
612.372	of other Hazaras
616.907	could shed some light to show the people
619.96	how these people are suffering
619.96	in their countries of origin,
624.261	and how they suffer,
628.18	why they risk their lives to seek asylum.
632.916	Thank you.
634.426	(Applause)
